[00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:13.664]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:43.967]  Police have now talked to, they're telling police that they heard the driver saying, yelling, Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar, during this incident, which is now leading authorities to believe that this is, as a result, that this is now a terrorism case.
[00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:50.653]  And I'm just getting an update now, the FBI is taking over this case, because it appears now that this is terrorism.
[00:00:50.993 --> 00:00:56.035]  And then sitting right next to him is the former director of the CIA who told everybody that we should basically accept orthodox Islam.
[00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.651]  There is no end to these people, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:33.676]  That was Jake Tapper, the unintentional comedian, up there talking about normally under beautiful circumstances we hear Allah Akbar.
[00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:36.157]  Really, when do we hear Allah Akbar?
[00:01:37.177 --> 00:01:39.178]  When jihadis are killing people.
[00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.461]  And ISIS posted photos a month ago of the exact spot
[00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:47.939]  Where 8 people were killed and 11 injured.
[00:01:48.419 --> 00:02:06.725]  Would have been in the hundreds, like niece, but a police officer, within 10 seconds of it starting, drew his firearm, and began firing on the vehicle, and then killed the SOB.
[00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:11.687]  There is no end to this.
[00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:14.068]  There is literally no end to this.
[00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.813]  Oh, and look at CNN last night with their live coverage.
[00:02:17.113 --> 00:02:18.696]  Citizens know what to do to the enemy.
[00:02:19.237 --> 00:02:21.099]  It's promoted and brought in all the illegals.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.925]  There are great citizens with our operation that Infowars launched.
[00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:26.828]  CNN is ISIS.
[00:02:26.888 --> 00:02:27.829]  Mike Cernovich's idea.
[00:02:28.837 --> 00:02:31.558]  Great job, folks, getting out there and doing it.
[00:02:31.638 --> 00:02:33.999]  Do it everywhere, because they are ISIS.
[00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:39.560]  They represent Hillary and Obama and Al Gore that called for an Arab Spring here in America five years ago.
[00:02:40.421 --> 00:02:41.841]  They financed one worldwide.
[00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:43.802]  This is anti-Christian.
[00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:51.584]  Al Gore, let me tell you, behind the scenes, is quarterbacking the attempted takedown of free speech in America and this broadcast.
[00:02:52.184 --> 00:02:54.065]  In the next few weeks, I'll be at liberty to tell you about it.
[00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:54.885]  I'm not at this point.
[00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:58.126]  But we have Soros, Al Gore,
[00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:05.470]  You've seen Podesta saying, Alex Jones, eat sh, you know what, tea.
[00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.271]  He never even tweets, but it's about me.
[00:03:09.631 --> 00:03:11.131]  And I don't say that like I'm bragging.
[00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:12.371]  I need everybody's prayers.
[00:03:13.972 --> 00:03:21.313]  And I need your financial support because that's how we beat these people, is being able to stand against their operations.
[00:03:24.054 --> 00:03:25.574]  But I'll tell you one thing, I'm proud.
[00:03:27.876 --> 00:03:31.398]  The fact that Roger Stone works for Infowars and he's being sued by Obama's law firm.
[00:03:32.918 --> 00:03:35.480]  And I am proud that Al Gore is coming after me.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.422]  Because I mean to pick a fight.
[00:03:39.662 --> 00:03:40.882]  I mean to get them out in the open.
[00:03:41.663 --> 00:03:45.224]  Let everybody see what they're doing and whatever happens to me, that's the way it is.
[00:03:45.364 --> 00:03:48.506]  But Infowars is a champion operation, folks.
[00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.250]  We need you to buy the products and spread the word and hand share the videos and articles and you've been doing it.
[00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.631]  We're defeating them and but we are in the thick of the battle.
[00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:00.991]  And I want to say this audience is not an audience.
[00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:02.171]  You are super active.
[00:04:02.832 --> 00:04:03.912]  You are in the arena.
[00:04:03.932 --> 00:04:05.552]  I salute you.
[00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:10.853]  You are the strength and the backbone, not just this country, but worldwide.
[00:04:11.193 --> 00:04:13.514]  We are the heart of the resistance and the enemy knows it.
[00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:15.714]  And I think they can smash us.
[00:04:15.894 --> 00:04:18.715]  All that'll do is invigorate us even more.
[00:04:19.602 --> 00:04:24.384]  And as Winston Churchill said, we shall go on to the end, whatever the cost may be.
[00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:26.366]  We shall defend our republic.
[00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:28.267]  We shall never surrender.
[00:04:29.487 --> 00:04:32.229]  He said we shall go on to the end, whatever the price may be.
[00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:34.150]  We shall defend our island.
[00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.271]  We shall go on to the end.
[00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:39.492]  We shall go on to the end.
[00:04:40.173 --> 00:04:41.133]  And as you can see, we're winning.
[00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:43.274]  But it is a war.
[00:04:45.235 --> 00:04:46.476]  Quite frankly, I love it.
[00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:50.701]  Wait till I can bring all this stuff out very soon.
[00:04:52.323 --> 00:04:55.988]  They figured out we've got PIs and people on them.
[00:04:56.048 --> 00:04:57.430]  They're getting really freaked out.
[00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:00.674]  So I'm not telling you anything they don't know already.
[00:05:00.974 --> 00:05:01.475]  We'll be back.
[00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:01.896]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.548 --> 00:05:07.331]  America is an information-based civil war.
[00:05:07.672 --> 00:05:14.981]  That's why now more than ever we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:20.727]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[00:05:21.448 --> 00:05:28.812]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:37.077]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:42.400]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.281]  They are the anti-liberals.
[00:05:44.942 --> 00:05:49.004]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide,
[00:05:49.284 --> 00:05:57.947]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high quality T shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:58.287 --> 00:06:02.348]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.911]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:06:14.272 --> 00:06:18.173]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:25.743 --> 00:06:34.327]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:45.293]  We had an Army intel officer recently retired into other agencies, or promoted, who I know has given us good info on air.
[00:06:45.893 --> 00:06:49.175]  And it's mirrored information I've gotten from other sources inside the Deep State.
[00:06:50.056 --> 00:06:53.497]  And he was going to come on today, but he got called into a meeting yesterday.
[00:06:53.577 --> 00:06:54.238]  They were listening.
[00:06:55.365 --> 00:06:57.146]  And he's gotten in some trouble.
[00:06:58.747 --> 00:06:59.468]  And what did he say?
[00:06:59.548 --> 00:07:08.733]  He said there's clearly Saudi Arabian connections to Vegas and that there's more imminent attacks coming in the next few days.
[00:07:09.734 --> 00:07:17.079]  And of course ISIS posted a photo a month ago of the exact route and the exact spot where the
[00:07:18.666 --> 00:07:36.274]  Bicyclers were run over by a cowardly sack of garbage, who would have probably killed hundreds, like we saw in Niche, with 89 dead, hundreds wounded, if a police officer hadn't started firing on him within 10 seconds.
[00:07:36.834 --> 00:07:37.154]  Boom!
[00:07:37.194 --> 00:07:38.515]  That guy's running over people.
[00:07:38.855 --> 00:07:39.595]  That's on purpose.
[00:07:39.855 --> 00:07:40.756]  Boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:07:40.816 --> 00:07:41.796]  And then got him.
[00:07:42.696 --> 00:07:47.038]  Or he probably would have killed just like in just one of the many attacks in France.
[00:07:47.058 --> 00:07:47.359]  What was it, 89?
[00:07:49.676 --> 00:07:50.637]  Including children!
[00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.339]  Three four-year-olds running!
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.304]  Like something out of... The original Mad Max!
[00:07:57.064 --> 00:07:58.506]  Just running over babies!
[00:07:58.606 --> 00:07:59.707]  Running over toddlers!
[00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:09.018]  Screaming... Like a retarded hound dog!
[00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:23.048]  And, oh, he was a refugee on one of the, quote, diversity visas that the UN runs via UNESCO.
[00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:25.930]  Cultural enrichment's what it's called.
[00:08:25.951 --> 00:08:27.432]  It's not a joke when we call it that.
[00:08:27.452 --> 00:08:28.012]  That's their term.
[00:08:28.392 --> 00:08:31.975]  And under UNESCO and the UN, it controls our State Department until now.
[00:08:33.336 --> 00:08:38.660]  And then we admit to the country whoever they say.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.241]  Is that not global government?
[00:08:48.004 --> 00:08:50.805]  Look at this deranged inbred lunatic.
[00:08:51.886 --> 00:08:59.630]  That's why there's so much mental illness from those rural areas of Uzbekistan and Afghanistan and other areas where this lunatic came from.
[00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.791]  And again, the numbers are there.
[00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:14.237]  There is more than a 35,000% higher instance of birth defects in individuals from those regions that come from small towns.
[00:09:16.454 --> 00:09:17.675]  And they are crazy.
[00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:23.818]  Just like royalty in Egypt or royalty in England would become completely insane.
[00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:28.661]  You know, most of Queen Elizabeth's sisters had to be locked up in mental asylum for the rest of their lives.
[00:09:29.442 --> 00:09:31.743]  Usually out of five or six, they get one good one.
[00:09:33.984 --> 00:09:37.706]  That's why they started marrying commoners 50 years ago.
[00:09:38.547 --> 00:09:43.810]  They said, gee, the genetic experts tell us this is why most of our family are complete lunatics.
[00:09:45.287 --> 00:09:46.648]  There's a headline in the New York Times.
[00:09:46.848 --> 00:09:49.390]  Saudi Arabia awakens to the perils of inbreeding.
[00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.332]  They awakened to it in 2003.
[00:09:52.412 --> 00:09:57.616]  They also just awakened to not wiping their rear end with their hands.
[00:09:57.976 --> 00:09:59.457]  I mean, I'm not against anybody.
[00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:00.297]  I'm just saying.
[00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:05.681]  Jones is racist again, saying many Muslims are inbred.
[00:10:05.901 --> 00:10:07.903]  No, it's a fact, Jack.
[00:10:08.343 --> 00:10:09.284]  Arranged marriages.
[00:10:10.882 --> 00:10:14.923]  And then you want to know who your daughter marries, so she marries a first cousin.
[00:10:15.703 --> 00:10:22.644]  And then you do it over, and over, and over, and pretty soon, your mom is your sister.
[00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:29.386]  Yes, your mom, I'm gonna say it again, your mom is your sister.
[00:10:30.506 --> 00:10:34.367]  Your mom, oh that's very common, your mom is your sister.
[00:10:36.138 --> 00:10:48.051]  And then you wonder why your eyes are pointing different directions, literally, and why you're whacked out of your mind, and why you want to kill everybody, because you're like an inbred breed of dog you see just drooling on the side of the street.
[00:10:48.651 --> 00:10:51.755]  They go, look at my highbred dog, and I go, yeah, I see a mentally retarded animal.
[00:10:52.355 --> 00:10:53.677]  Look at this mentally retarded animal.
[00:10:53.897 --> 00:10:55.539]  Let's put him up on screen.
[00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.953]  A vicious, psychotic, inbred ISIS... Look at that guy!
[00:11:01.233 --> 00:11:02.635]  Look at that demon!
[00:11:03.775 --> 00:11:06.257]  Oh, and he just culturally enriched!
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.781]  And again, it's a cucking for the left.
[00:11:10.861 --> 00:11:17.506]  They, leftists in their homes across the nation last night, weren't just making apologies, like Jake Tapper saying, it's beautiful.
[00:11:18.987 --> 00:11:23.350]  But a lot of them, you can better believe, were engaging in self-flagellation.
[00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:25.232]  And I'm not joking when I say that.
[00:11:26.266 --> 00:11:38.322]  They love this, the fact that the left can bring in millions of these people with their eyes pointing different directions from the inbreeding.
[00:11:40.137 --> 00:11:48.482]  And, but totally psychotic, always believe they're God, like a lot of other seriously inbred, mentally retarded people, it's very sad.
[00:11:48.903 --> 00:11:53.766]  But this type of inbreeding creates psychotic psychosis in high numbers.
[00:11:54.686 --> 00:11:57.408]  So it's not just the religion, folks, it's the inbreeding.
[00:11:58.068 --> 00:12:00.310]  Armies of inbred psycho killers.
[00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:06.694]  Zombo, psycho, inbred, Muslim hillbillies attacking.
[00:12:09.773 --> 00:12:12.214]  Everybody knows there is the Appalachian where some people are inbred.
[00:12:12.554 --> 00:12:14.695]  You don't mess with those people, they'll kill you in two seconds.
[00:12:15.015 --> 00:12:16.335]  Because they're inbred, folks.
[00:12:16.375 --> 00:12:17.136]  They're crazy.
[00:12:19.997 --> 00:12:28.820]  Imagine if there was a billion Appalachians in the world, and half of them were inbred and psychotic, and they're just literally raining them down on us.
[00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:32.021]  Excuse me.
[00:12:32.941 --> 00:12:34.141]  I've just got to tell you like it is.
[00:12:36.024 --> 00:12:39.926]  Trump said we've got to stop these visas from unvetted countries.
[00:12:40.906 --> 00:12:43.847]  This guy had terrorized, he'd never been allowed in.
[00:12:43.927 --> 00:12:47.249]  In 2015 he was running around saying he was going to kill people, so the FBI went.
[00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:55.152]  But that was Obama's FBI, just like San Bernardino, or just like Fort Hood, or the hundreds of other attacks now in the Western world.
[00:12:56.641 --> 00:13:06.846]  It's covered up and not an act of terror, but this guy in front of witnesses was chirping, chirping the Allah Akbar, I'm an inbred piece of garbage.
[00:13:07.846 --> 00:13:11.228]  So he was chirping, I'm an inbred psychopath with delusions of grandeur.
[00:13:11.248 --> 00:13:15.370]  That's what you get when you're inbred, a lot of times it's just delusions of grandeur, you think you're invincible.
[00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.512]  You're a drooling idiot who wipes his butt with your hand.
[00:13:20.092 --> 00:13:25.295]  But you're God, and Linda Saussure loves you and wants to put women under it.
[00:13:27.073 --> 00:13:28.235]  Because, look at Louis the Sorcerer!
[00:13:28.615 --> 00:13:29.576]  Looks like his brother!
[00:13:29.596 --> 00:13:32.320]  It's the same dude!
[00:13:32.901 --> 00:13:33.662]  Same genetics!
[00:13:34.323 --> 00:13:35.425]  All scrambled together!
[00:13:38.208 --> 00:13:41.193]  All the slave trading, all of it comes from these folks.
[00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:44.932]  And we're just supposed to be culturally rich?
[00:13:45.613 --> 00:13:48.694]  Too bad you didn't fully take Europe 1400 years ago!
[00:13:48.714 --> 00:13:51.516]  Too bad there was a counter-strike called the Crusades!
[00:13:51.876 --> 00:13:53.197]  We apologize!
[00:13:53.277 --> 00:13:54.458]  Please take us over!
[00:13:54.918 --> 00:14:00.821]  Please inbreed us and pour acid on our faces and cut women's genitals off and murder the gays!
[00:14:01.142 --> 00:14:02.382]  It's liberal!
[00:14:02.723 --> 00:14:03.643]  Liberal!
[00:14:04.564 --> 00:14:05.324]  Murder us!
[00:14:05.504 --> 00:14:06.165]  Murder us!
[00:14:06.185 --> 00:14:06.725]  We're liberal!
[00:14:09.935 --> 00:14:11.337]  Oh, but things aren't going too well.
[00:14:11.377 --> 00:14:12.318]  Here's the headline today.
[00:14:12.678 --> 00:14:23.370]  Hollywood accusers, harassers, molesters, rapists, the rap sheets, 56 so far, and suddenly it's pedophilia popping up.
[00:14:24.712 --> 00:14:24.992]  Oh!
[00:14:25.533 --> 00:14:27.115]  And who does Harvey Weinstein like?
[00:14:27.155 --> 00:14:30.599]  He wants to bring in Muslims to cuck your world.
[00:14:33.578 --> 00:14:38.960]  Just like he likes to debase women and young girls, he's gonna debase the whole country.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.842]  He said yesterday he's giving the world a gift.
[00:14:42.282 --> 00:14:45.704]  With what he's just done, you're lucky I've given you this gift.
[00:14:46.144 --> 00:14:47.565]  I'm Harvey Weinstein.
[00:14:48.406 --> 00:14:54.729]  Now just like Europe just took in 10 million military-age men, you're gonna take us and we're gonna slaughter you all they want!
[00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:55.570]  It's liberal!
[00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:57.851]  Oh, it's so liberal!
[00:15:00.475 --> 00:15:03.277]  These are the insane maniacs that think they're God.
[00:15:03.618 --> 00:15:04.438]  But here's the thing.
[00:15:04.859 --> 00:15:05.499]  We're awake.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.960]  We're aware of you.
[00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:08.902]  We're never going away.
[00:15:09.222 --> 00:15:10.684]  We're never stopping.
[00:15:10.884 --> 00:15:12.105]  We're never backing down.
[00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:13.466]  We're never giving in.
[00:15:14.146 --> 00:15:15.427]  And we're winning, scum.
[00:15:17.849 --> 00:15:21.673]  So enjoy the long, dark night that's coming for you.
[00:15:23.499 --> 00:15:27.801]  Now continuing here, oh, let's read more about the cultural enrichment.
[00:15:27.821 --> 00:15:31.683]  Can we put our enricher back on the television for us here?
[00:15:31.743 --> 00:15:34.904]  I mean, we're about to go to break, but there's our enricher.
[00:15:36.145 --> 00:15:38.346]  He showed us, and it was cultural.
[00:15:38.386 --> 00:15:39.066]  It's just culture.
[00:15:39.386 --> 00:15:40.206]  Don't judge a culture.
[00:15:40.566 --> 00:15:41.667]  Killing people is his culture.
[00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:43.427]  Everyone should thank him.
[00:15:43.467 --> 00:15:44.387]  The victim's families.
[00:15:44.647 --> 00:15:47.948]  Those barely alive should say, oh, Allah Akbar, like Tapper said.
[00:15:47.968 --> 00:15:48.948]  I'm going to play it when we come back.
[00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:50.169]  Allah Akbar.
[00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:51.329]  It's so beautiful.
[00:15:51.529 --> 00:15:54.410]  In the middle of this, Tapper's just, oh, it's so beautiful.
[00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.050]  It's so beautiful.
[00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.711]  You are the resistance.
[00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:10.546]  On a daily basis in this country, but also overseas, there are massive busts of actual pedophiles and the kidnapped children.
[00:16:11.186 --> 00:16:18.111]  What's insane is there's almost no mainstream news coverage of it, because the establishment is in on it.
[00:16:18.771 --> 00:16:23.835]  We know who runs this global government cult, and they are pedophiles and even worse.
[00:16:26.627 --> 00:16:31.191]  It's been said the devil's greatest trick was convincing the world that he didn't exist.
[00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:35.956]  Now whether you believe in the devil or not, evil exists on this planet.
[00:16:36.276 --> 00:16:45.925]  And the glue that welds together this globalist, one-world, psychopathic system is the exploitation of men, women, and most importantly, children.
[00:16:46.425 --> 00:16:55.992]  We all know from history books that every ancient culture in different periods engaged in human sacrifice during pre-collapse periods.
[00:16:56.452 --> 00:17:01.576]  Camille Pagli and other historians have written extensively on this and its historical fact.
[00:17:02.376 --> 00:17:10.198]  And since President Trump got into office close to 10 months ago, we have seen record numbers of busts.
[00:17:10.639 --> 00:17:18.941]  Not just of people looking at child porn, but of actual traffickers, of actual kidnappers, of people that had children in their hands.
[00:17:19.301 --> 00:17:25.403]  We've seen the Deputy Pope arrested for reportedly kidnapping over 100 children over 40 years and trafficking them.
[00:17:25.523 --> 00:17:33.186]  We've seen the previous Pope step down amidst another giant child trafficking scandal and reported blackmail operation.
[00:17:33.746 --> 00:17:37.147]  We've seen Sandusky and his son indicted and convicted.
[00:17:37.528 --> 00:17:48.992]  We've seen countless reports of high-level judges and politicians and people in both parties getting busted soliciting sex from sometimes children as young as six months old.
[00:17:49.432 --> 00:18:06.220]  And now from our Hollywood sources and major filmmakers we're learning that the Weinstein debacle and fiasco and nightmare is only the tip of the iceberg and that below that is the giant pedophile army and below that the true Satanism that goes on at the bottom of this filthy rabbit hole.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.740]  And that takes us to today's news.
[00:18:08.961 --> 00:18:15.862]  And it comes out in local news, but gets almost no national news coverage, no matter how horrific or how sensational.
[00:18:16.322 --> 00:18:18.503]  This is from 9 News out of Denver.
[00:18:19.063 --> 00:18:22.924]  FBI helps rescue 84 children from sex trafficking.
[00:18:23.844 --> 00:18:28.885]  It's gotten almost no coverage here in the United States, but it's big news in France and Russia.
[00:18:29.325 --> 00:18:35.727]  Again, they rescued 84 children, some of them as young as 3 months, being pimped out.
[00:18:37.034 --> 00:18:44.857]  At places like restaurants and truck stops all over the United States, this is industrial level.
[00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:49.919]  This is even retail level, where the general public's getting involved in this.
[00:18:50.259 --> 00:18:52.000]  This is widespread.
[00:18:52.967 --> 00:19:00.630]  That's why we've seen Salon and all these other big leftist publications in the New York Times come out and basically defend pedophilia, why the UN's defended it.
[00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:16.796]  That's why they've created fake Pizzagate stories that they claim we created, so they can then claim there's no such thing as pedophilia going on in the world, when the truth is they've busted British Prime Ministers and world leaders involved in Satanism and killing children, not just raping them.
[00:19:17.276 --> 00:19:26.966]  The good news is thanks to President Trump and many other great patriots around the world, from Australia to England to the US to Canada, the pedophile rings are being busted at record levels.
[00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:35.414]  But they're running mainstream news articles claiming that we've made it up and that there is no pedophile phenomenon and there is no roundup taking place.
[00:19:36.255 --> 00:19:41.618]  The individuals covering this up are either incredibly stupid, or they're collaborating, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:42.539 --> 00:19:47.262]  Bottom line, there is an attack on innocence in this world, and InfoWars is fighting it.
[00:19:47.602 --> 00:20:01.350]  And when you spread the word about our shows, and spread our live links, and spread our articles, and spread this report, you are standing directly against these evil organizations and groups that exploit our children, and you are standing for humanity and a future.
[00:20:06.033 --> 00:20:17.848]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.692]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:20.752 --> 00:20:22.675]  Because there is a war on.
[00:20:22.975 --> 00:20:23.956]  For your mind.
[00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:46.877]  Police have now talked to, they're telling police that they heard the driver saying, yelling, Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar, during this incident, which is now leading authorities to believe that this is as a result, that this is now a terrorism case.
[00:20:47.197 --> 00:20:53.121]  And I'm just getting an update now, the FBI is taking over this case because it appears now that this is terrorism.
[00:20:53.402 --> 00:20:55.683]  The Arabic Chanda, Allah Akbar, God is great.
[00:20:56.724 --> 00:21:23.618]  Sometimes said under the most beautiful circumstances and too often we hear of it being being said in moments like this They brought in 10 million people into the EU the last five years 80% of them according to Interpol are military age men most of them are military refugees there are people that came and invaded Syria and other areas their fighters left over from the Libya takeover and they're being brought into Europe and from
[00:21:24.921 --> 00:21:41.093]  Sweden, to Denmark, to the UK, they take actual terrorists that are famous, killing people on television, killing unarmed prisoners, and they rehabilitate them, giving them housing, welfare, and classes taught by other Imams.
[00:21:41.574 --> 00:21:47.098]  And it's all like this weird, sick, politically correct joke run by the EU.
[00:21:49.121 --> 00:22:03.694]  And that's the thing is I think about this and how Trump was demonized for saying seven countries that don't even have working airports or passport systems, like Somalia, like Sudan, like Libya, you don't get to come here.
[00:22:03.894 --> 00:22:05.495]  We're not giving you visas.
[00:22:07.116 --> 00:22:09.639]  I mean, you can't go to Japan unless you've got a visa.
[00:22:10.059 --> 00:22:10.900]  Doesn't matter where you're from.
[00:22:12.967 --> 00:22:16.510]  You can't go to Russia unless you have a visa.
[00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.713]  You can't, Mexico, you tell them how long you're gonna be there.
[00:22:19.733 --> 00:22:23.096]  You get a limited visa when you fly in to Cancun or whatever.
[00:22:23.136 --> 00:22:27.139]  You tell them when you're gonna be there, where you're staying, your phone number, and when you're leaving.
[00:22:27.439 --> 00:22:34.806]  And let me tell you something, I know folks that have gone down to Mexico, decided to stay a couple extra days, they call the hotel up the next day and say, where is Mr. Johnson?
[00:22:38.109 --> 00:22:39.550]  And if they catch you there illegally,
[00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:43.867]  Six months to a year hard prison time.
[00:22:44.968 --> 00:22:54.435]  Again, but then all I hear about our super open society and country, then is racist and evil and bad.
[00:22:54.976 --> 00:22:57.918]  And then all these courts fought the president when the law is very clear.
[00:22:58.198 --> 00:23:00.180]  He finally wins 9-0 at the Supreme Court.
[00:23:01.411 --> 00:23:05.032]  And we saw Nice, where the police did shoot and kill the driver.
[00:23:05.712 --> 00:23:09.834]  I was having a Freudian thing when I said this hero police officer shot and killed this guy.
[00:23:09.874 --> 00:23:11.294]  He shot him and stopped him.
[00:23:12.074 --> 00:23:13.335]  Killed his terror attack.
[00:23:13.615 --> 00:23:15.775]  He is still alive, which is bittersweet.
[00:23:15.795 --> 00:23:16.676]  I wish he was dead.
[00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:21.257]  But at the same time, they'll get more intel off of this guy.
[00:23:21.297 --> 00:23:25.718]  But they already knew in 2015 he was shooting his mouth off about killing people.
[00:23:26.098 --> 00:23:28.079]  His imam, to his credit,
[00:23:31.764 --> 00:23:38.746]  Said, hey, I told the police, they didn't do anything, and they could have stopped him.
[00:23:39.806 --> 00:23:40.306]  But they didn't.
[00:23:40.626 --> 00:23:41.086]  And why?
[00:23:41.366 --> 00:23:51.549]  Which is rare, to actually have one of these guys, Imams, I guess he didn't want to spend the rest of his life in a Supermax prison, probably a smart move, to have tried to stop this.
[00:23:53.329 --> 00:23:58.811]  And listen folks, I didn't want to go into the Middle East, I didn't want to destabilize Iraq, to bring in the more radical Muslims out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:02.919]  I don't hate people under authoritarian regimes.
[00:24:04.199 --> 00:24:10.081]  And I know there's been periods in the world when Muslims weren't all killing each other and weren't invading all their neighbors.
[00:24:10.801 --> 00:24:15.763]  And I know Christianity has had its expansionist and authoritative stripes.
[00:24:16.463 --> 00:24:26.586]  But Islam today is out of control and is empowered by Soros and the globalists and is a clear and present weapon being used against our countries.
[00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:29.489]  It's incompatible.
[00:24:29.889 --> 00:24:35.298]  I can't go to their countries and practice my religion or not practice it or be gay if I was gay.
[00:24:36.079 --> 00:24:42.650]  That's fundamental, ladies and gentlemen, or be a Buddhist or be an atheist.
[00:24:44.744 --> 00:24:51.109]  If I lived in Saudi Arabia, my wife or daughters couldn't take driver's education or drive a car?
[00:24:52.049 --> 00:25:00.955]  And I don't need to repeat all this, it's just we have attacks now every week in Europe, every week in Canada or the US, every week in Australia.
[00:25:01.256 --> 00:25:09.782]  There are constant attacks where the Allah Akbar individual will shoot four or five people and scream Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar, just two weeks ago in Maryland!
[00:25:10.362 --> 00:25:12.022]  Killed six people screaming Allah Akbar!
[00:25:12.503 --> 00:25:16.284]  It didn't even make national news, except for Fox.
[00:25:17.064 --> 00:25:18.804]  People say, oh Fox is so right-wing.
[00:25:19.144 --> 00:25:20.765]  They showed you it was a Muslim attack?
[00:25:21.365 --> 00:25:23.285]  That's the benchmark of conservatism?
[00:25:23.585 --> 00:25:31.688]  Is just to admit another religious zealot, programmed to kill, went out and did it, and killed six people and what, wounded four others?
[00:25:33.148 --> 00:25:37.029]  It was a manhunt for the guy, and it wasn't even in the national news.
[00:25:38.863 --> 00:25:39.583]  A manhunt!
[00:25:40.003 --> 00:25:41.644]  And they won't put it on television!
[00:25:42.904 --> 00:25:48.066]  But now, this guy posted reportedly to the internet what he was going to do.
[00:25:48.266 --> 00:25:49.666]  He had two fake guns on him.
[00:25:49.686 --> 00:25:50.826]  They're trying to blame guns.
[00:25:51.306 --> 00:25:54.968]  There's a fake tweet out there speaking of fake guns of Hillary.
[00:25:55.248 --> 00:25:56.928]  It's satire, not fake news.
[00:25:57.248 --> 00:25:58.849]  Satire, from a satire account.
[00:25:59.109 --> 00:25:59.769]  Put it on screen.
[00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:06.951]  Hillary reportedly tweeted, satirically, but it wasn't Hillary, again, a spoof account of Hillary Clinton.
[00:26:07.765 --> 00:26:11.746]  Tweeted, imagine if the truck would have had a silencer.
[00:26:13.186 --> 00:26:13.646]  Exactly.
[00:26:14.407 --> 00:26:15.147]  It's like Vegas.
[00:26:15.847 --> 00:26:18.908]  Imagine if the truck driver had a silencer.
[00:26:21.628 --> 00:26:24.829]  Satire is king in a world of lunacy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:29.470]  So, we have this individual.
[00:26:35.848 --> 00:26:41.893]  Saifullo Saipahav, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, New York City.
[00:26:44.215 --> 00:26:52.061]  Five Argentine nationals and a Belgian were among those killed when a man plowed into pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path in New York City.
[00:26:54.603 --> 00:26:59.707]  Police shot the suspect after he exited the vehicle and shouted Allah Akbar, which means God is great in Arabic.
[00:26:59.927 --> 00:27:04.531]  He is currently in police custody and officials said they're investigating the incident as an act of terror.
[00:27:05.461 --> 00:27:06.502]  Eight dead, eleven injured.
[00:27:07.723 --> 00:27:10.365]  Saifullo came to the U.S.
[00:27:10.385 --> 00:27:12.687]  from Uzbekistan seven years ago.
[00:27:13.048 --> 00:27:20.154]  He left a note referencing the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, a federal law enforcement source confirmed.
[00:27:20.674 --> 00:27:24.838]  And you know if Trump wasn't in, there'd be no chance the FBI would tell you it was even Islamic.
[00:27:25.258 --> 00:27:29.302]  Under Obama, Pulse nightclub, San Bernardino,
[00:27:31.169 --> 00:27:32.970]  They would come out and say it's not Islamic.
[00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.771]  It's not Islamic.
[00:27:34.071 --> 00:27:37.013]  And then four or five days later you'd learn it was Islamic.
[00:27:37.994 --> 00:27:41.636]  And then the guy's weirdo dad shows up at a Democratic Party function for Hillary.
[00:27:43.037 --> 00:27:47.420]  I mean, it's just insane how arrogant these people are.
[00:27:48.461 --> 00:27:52.184]  And they know full well that we're not invited into their nations, into their countries.
[00:27:52.524 --> 00:27:55.426]  They know full well they're not from tolerant societies.
[00:27:56.066 --> 00:27:59.409]  And so let's stop pretending that's the case.
[00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:08.367]  But I'm going to go over the attack in detail and get into some other important areas on the other side, but Jake Tapper is paid to do what he does.
[00:28:08.767 --> 00:28:12.368]  And he just said, Allah Akbar is usually so beautiful.
[00:28:12.948 --> 00:28:14.288]  It's so beautiful.
[00:28:14.768 --> 00:28:15.709]  That's really sick.
[00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:25.471]  And what he is doing is virtue signaling from CNN that we got your back.
[00:28:26.883 --> 00:28:27.803]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[00:28:28.464 --> 00:28:32.206]  Kind of like the individual that went out and shot Congressmen Scalise and others.
[00:28:33.266 --> 00:28:41.510]  That day, Wolf Blitzer had a guest on, saying that he was a hero.
[00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:43.631]  Wolf Blitzer didn't disagree.
[00:28:44.511 --> 00:28:45.572]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:45.592 --> 00:28:45.972]  Stay with us.
[00:28:54.637 --> 00:28:59.300]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:29:02.222 --> 00:29:02.822]  Hey Daniel.

[00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:19.413]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[00:29:19.693 --> 00:29:25.679]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[00:29:25.839 --> 00:29:32.226]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[00:29:32.446 --> 00:29:42.576]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[00:29:42.796 --> 00:29:49.242]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[00:29:49.603 --> 00:29:52.225]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[00:29:52.485 --> 00:29:55.809]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[00:29:56.089 --> 00:30:01.014]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:30:07.193 --> 00:30:12.615]  Vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:30:13.656 --> 00:30:21.599]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[00:30:22.419 --> 00:30:29.382]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[00:30:30.022 --> 00:30:35.084]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[00:30:37.185 --> 00:30:37.525]  I think so.
[00:31:02.595 --> 00:31:06.497]  You go to infowarstore.com and get game-changing, amazing products.
[00:31:06.977 --> 00:31:10.139]  We've been sold out of DNA Force for almost four months.
[00:31:10.759 --> 00:31:16.121]  These ingredients are nutraceutical-grade, you know, the highest quality, the bio-PQQ, all of it.
[00:31:16.321 --> 00:31:16.561]  It's 25% off.
[00:31:17.782 --> 00:31:23.945]  The Trump got in this morning, and it's back, but it is a limited run because of all the testing and all the rest of it.
[00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:24.886]  It's the highest quality.
[00:31:25.146 --> 00:31:26.887]  Read about what it'll do for you and your family.
[00:31:27.127 --> 00:31:27.847]  It is amazing.
[00:31:27.988 --> 00:31:32.650]  We also have been sold out for three months on biome defense, super high quality probiotic.
[00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.970]  It's 25% off.
[00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:38.492]  Out of the gates, back in stock, but for a very limited time.
[00:31:38.773 --> 00:31:41.253]  So you get the highest quality, the very cleanest stuff out there.
[00:31:41.534 --> 00:31:42.434]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:44.274]  DNA Force and Biome Defense.
[00:31:44.615 --> 00:31:45.095]  Probiotic.
[00:31:45.135 --> 00:31:45.915]  Now back in stock.
[00:31:45.995 --> 00:31:46.955]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:47.135 --> 00:31:50.557]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[00:31:50.997 --> 00:31:52.337]  It is an act of war.
[00:31:52.617 --> 00:31:53.918]  It is an act of standing up.
[00:31:54.178 --> 00:31:59.720]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[00:32:01.826 --> 00:32:08.509]  Listers, this is hardcore info, and it's groundbreaking information, and it's all financed by your support and the work you do.
[00:32:09.369 --> 00:32:11.110]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:15.012]  I'm very excited to announce that DNA Force has been sold out for almost four months.
[00:32:15.352 --> 00:32:21.114]  It's very hard to source the super organic, high quality, suitable medical grade, BioPQQ and CoQ10 and other things.
[00:32:21.495 --> 00:32:26.577]  It is back in stock, 25% off, ladies and gentlemen, and we have a limited supply of that.
[00:32:27.037 --> 00:32:28.898]  But you're just such great patrons and supporters.
[00:32:28.918 --> 00:32:29.678]  I want to cut the price.
[00:32:29.999 --> 00:32:31.539]  We also have Biome Defense.
[00:32:31.639 --> 00:32:32.920]  Amazing, super high quality.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.222]  Highest quality we can produce with top firms of probiotic.
[00:32:37.022 --> 00:32:38.183]  That's been sold out for months.
[00:32:38.503 --> 00:32:39.544]  That's now back in stock.
[00:32:39.584 --> 00:32:40.644]  Limited run of that.
[00:32:40.784 --> 00:32:43.746]  And there's a bunch of other sales that are ending today.

[00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:54.071]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:32.048]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:32.428 --> 00:33:35.490]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:42.873 --> 00:33:53.218]  Now coming up in the next segment, I'm gonna play six minutes of a phone call from a caller that goes by the name Zach, who recently got out of
[00:33:54.887 --> 00:34:10.795]  Army Special Forces Command out of Florida, and who's been calling for years, but really been giving us amazing information that's open source, as a citizen, not classified or secret, on the show.
[00:34:11.076 --> 00:34:15.278]  And I know it's amazing information because I've already got most of the same information.
[00:34:15.318 --> 00:34:19.240]  Sometimes I have more information, sometimes a lot less, but I get the same information.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.662]  Plus I do my own research, so I can tell these for real.
[00:34:23.602 --> 00:34:25.304]  I said, I want you on for a full hour tomorrow.
[00:34:25.504 --> 00:34:27.125]  They called him right after the show.
[00:34:27.185 --> 00:34:33.471]  They were listening and they called him into a meeting and are chewing him out right now, even though it's his right to do that.
[00:34:33.731 --> 00:34:37.115]  Just like Colonel Schaefer got chewed out for exposing Benghazi.
[00:34:38.756 --> 00:34:39.577]  And so much more.
[00:34:39.637 --> 00:34:42.479]  So next segment, I'm going to air those excerpts.
[00:34:43.553 --> 00:34:47.855]  Of what he talked about with Vegas and the big imminent terror attacks that are coming.
[00:34:48.556 --> 00:34:52.277]  He said imminent and then of course hours later we see another Islamic terror attack.
[00:34:52.658 --> 00:34:54.779]  Look at that evil grin.
[00:34:55.719 --> 00:35:03.083]  That murderous, satisfied, psycho look that you see in the eyes of British royalty.
[00:35:03.894 --> 00:35:04.655]  It's the inbreeding.
[00:35:05.136 --> 00:35:06.698]  And again, the New York Times even admits it.
[00:35:07.138 --> 00:35:18.272]  Serious crime problems, mental illness problems, birth defect problems with folks out of Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other areas because of the inbreeding.
[00:35:18.993 --> 00:35:19.914]  And it is a fact.
[00:35:21.696 --> 00:35:22.838]  So we're going to be looking at that.
[00:35:27.318 --> 00:35:30.500]  We were just showing you an image of the famous Hapsburg chin.
[00:35:31.861 --> 00:35:35.204]  That again, a lot of our Islamic friends have it as well.
[00:35:36.125 --> 00:35:39.967]  Also the lazy eye is another thing.
[00:35:40.468 --> 00:35:45.572]  But in England, they see lazy eyes as a sign of royalty and nobility.
[00:35:45.932 --> 00:35:55.499]  I mean, you go to some highfalutin event with British aristocracy or, you know, folks in the upper crust, and I've been to a few of them, I mean, there aren't hardly any eyeballs pointing in the right direction.
[00:35:56.039 --> 00:35:56.380]  Excuse me.
[00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:01.955]  The point is, is that we've got even more inbreeding going on here.
[00:36:01.975 --> 00:36:05.078]  But I'm sorry, I am just getting to the bottom of the problem here.
[00:36:05.358 --> 00:36:07.200]  Back to what I was about to say for the earlier segment.
[00:36:10.644 --> 00:36:11.364]  We have people
[00:36:12.665 --> 00:36:22.249]  Like Jake Tapper coming out and saying, oh, he yelled Allah Akbar, usually such a beautiful, beautiful thing when we hear it, but now all too often a bad thing.
[00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:25.910]  That's a no-no on CNN to say Islamic terror, even Allah Akbar.
[00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.431]  So the reporter's obviously going to get in some trouble for that.
[00:36:28.871 --> 00:36:32.572]  Notice they won't even say Allah Akbar in the text on screen for TV viewers.
[00:36:33.213 --> 00:36:35.053]  There it is, 5.04 p.m.
[00:36:35.113 --> 00:36:37.454]  New York, about an hour and 30 minutes into it.
[00:36:37.914 --> 00:36:41.756]  Witnesses suspect was yelling, God is great in Arabic.
[00:36:43.046 --> 00:36:48.230]  No, it should say, he was yelling Allah Akbar, which is God is great in Arabic, but they always do it.
[00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:50.951]  It's how they whitewash, it's how they manipulate.
[00:36:51.472 --> 00:36:53.633]  And again, I can't go to these Muslim countries and live.
[00:36:55.294 --> 00:36:57.916]  Their women have their genitals cut off, they kill gay people.
[00:36:58.036 --> 00:36:59.497]  What in the world is going on?
[00:36:59.557 --> 00:37:09.404]  Why are the Hollywood degenerate pedophile elite, the elite maggots, the alpha maggots, why are they lecturing us on how we should run our culture and run our life?
[00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:15.792]  They want to bring in another group of people where child molestation is codified.
[00:37:16.712 --> 00:37:18.753]  Nine-year-old girls are okay for men to have sex with.
[00:37:19.273 --> 00:37:22.195]  It's okay for men to have sex with boys, just not with other men.
[00:37:22.415 --> 00:37:23.595]  That's executable offense.
[00:37:23.615 --> 00:37:28.598]  So pedophilia is legal under Sharia.
[00:37:31.219 --> 00:37:36.942]  They actually call it man-boy love, which you notice the North American Man-Boy Love Association.
[00:37:38.476 --> 00:37:39.677]  Starting to figure this out, folks?
[00:37:40.317 --> 00:37:44.720]  There's a reason Hollywood is completely allied.
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.081]  There it is, report.
[00:37:47.221 --> 00:37:49.263]  ISIS leader encourages pedophilia.
[00:37:52.645 --> 00:37:56.247]  Enjoying young boys is in the absence of women.
[00:37:59.629 --> 00:38:00.669]  Enjoy young boys.
[00:38:00.689 --> 00:38:01.690]  It's like you enjoy women.
[00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:03.631]  Forcing them into harems.
[00:38:03.951 --> 00:38:06.273]  That's a fancy name for sex slavery.
[00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.711]  Oh, but the West is where slavery came from.
[00:38:10.031 --> 00:38:11.091]  We're the bad ones.
[00:38:11.532 --> 00:38:12.752]  We're the evil people.
[00:38:13.192 --> 00:38:14.993]  We're the folks that have to be gotten rid of.
[00:38:15.973 --> 00:38:16.573]  It's amazing.
[00:38:21.375 --> 00:38:28.958]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:45.614]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfowarStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:38:45.674 --> 00:38:47.436]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:38:48.857 --> 00:38:53.882]  And because of the amazing success we've all had together in this endeavor, we are a bigger target than ever.
[00:38:54.322 --> 00:38:55.183]  And I don't mind that.
[00:38:55.343 --> 00:38:56.224]  I'm not looking
[00:38:58.988 --> 00:38:59.608]  For the shade.
[00:39:00.148 --> 00:39:02.049]  I'm not trying to hide in the weeds here.
[00:39:02.569 --> 00:39:07.351]  I'm trying to take on the globalist head-on so people can see exactly what's going on.
[00:39:08.192 --> 00:39:15.775]  And if you will just commit, it's so essential, and make the decision to buy high quality products
[00:39:17.577 --> 00:39:22.600]  In as much abundance as you see fit, we are basically unstoppable.
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.221]  They just want to kill my name and suicide of existence.
[00:39:25.522 --> 00:39:26.182]  That's not going to work.
[00:39:26.522 --> 00:39:27.963]  We've already done incredible work together.
[00:39:28.283 --> 00:39:32.646]  But I know together we're going to build even more resistance and be more effective.
[00:39:35.067 --> 00:39:40.650]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:42.872]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best.
[00:39:43.834 --> 00:39:48.657]  Fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:39:48.697 --> 00:39:51.058]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:39:51.098 --> 00:39:53.720]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:56.121]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:39:56.501 --> 00:39:58.943]  The concentrated as well from Emirates Essential.
[00:39:59.483 --> 00:40:00.623]  We've got the Caveman.
[00:40:00.724 --> 00:40:03.225]  We've got so many other great products.
[00:40:03.285 --> 00:40:06.067]  The X2 is such an important thing.
[00:40:06.687 --> 00:40:09.669]  The purest iodine that anybody's got out there.
[00:40:09.749 --> 00:40:11.750]  It is just amazing, the quality.
[00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:14.654]  And it's the missing halogen in the body.
[00:40:15.856 --> 00:40:21.585]  The bad halogens are the chlorine and the fluoride and the bromide and what we're being bombarded with that lowers IQ.
[00:40:22.786 --> 00:40:27.213]  And that, again, if your body doesn't have the good iodine, it will just absorb the bad halogens.
[00:40:28.463 --> 00:40:30.285]  It's such a game changer, that alone.
[00:40:30.945 --> 00:40:33.707]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:40:33.987 --> 00:40:34.667]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:40:34.888 --> 00:40:37.509]  And we are ending the special today.
[00:40:37.669 --> 00:40:40.772]  Anthroplex and BrainForce together, 50% off.
[00:40:41.052 --> 00:40:42.613]  That is ending today.
[00:40:42.633 --> 00:40:46.255]  50% off Anthroplex and BrainForce Plus.
[00:40:55.506 --> 00:40:57.607]  DNA Force has been sold out for almost four months.
[00:40:58.088 --> 00:41:06.112]  It's so hard to source the PQQ and the CoQ12 that are actually from the organic source, not synthetic.
[00:41:06.633 --> 00:41:11.376]  We sell ours at the same price people sell a synthetic that a lot of evidence shows you don't even absorb.
[00:41:12.816 --> 00:41:13.737]  So it's very hard.
[00:41:13.757 --> 00:41:19.360]  It's got a whole bunch of ingredients in it to get them all in, get them all sourced, have them all pass California standards, which this is doing.
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.021]  We've got the test.
[00:41:21.018 --> 00:41:31.905]  They've done the test there and found it, and then they test it over and over again until they find a batch that goes slightly above California, even though the FDA says a thousand times what they say California is what's dangerous.
[00:41:32.446 --> 00:41:33.527]  We all know how the ballgame works.
[00:41:33.807 --> 00:41:37.890]  The point is, we go through a lot of trouble making these be the very, very cleanest on the market.
[00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.913]  So, DNA Force, super high quality, 25% off, out of the gates.
[00:41:43.474 --> 00:41:48.658]  And unfortunately, we were only able to get a small run of these, so it's going to sell out in the next two weeks.
[00:41:48.698 --> 00:41:53.361]  So, if you want to take advantage of that and support the broadcast, I want to thank you all for your financial support.
[00:41:53.402 --> 00:41:54.542]  But it's symbiotic.
[00:41:55.743 --> 00:42:05.091]  DNA Force has hundreds of studies we're even allowed to talk about, because BioPQQ and CoQ10, these other things, and the resveratrol are known.
[00:42:06.235 --> 00:42:07.596]  I mean, a lot of these are drugs in Europe.
[00:42:08.237 --> 00:42:12.140]  So, you talk about cleaning out your cells, you're talking about next level antioxidant.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.521]  This is the best there is.
[00:42:14.041 --> 00:42:16.323]  They sell similar stuff in clinics for $400 to $600.
[00:42:18.305 --> 00:42:19.586]  And then people go, oh, well, it's from a doctor.
[00:42:19.606 --> 00:42:25.948]  It must be worth it when our stuff is better than most of the ones that are out there for $200 on the low end, $600 on the high end.
[00:42:26.868 --> 00:42:28.549]  People do all sorts of other wild things.
[00:42:28.569 --> 00:42:31.350]  They take these similar things intravenously from a doctor.
[00:42:32.711 --> 00:42:34.091]  And this is taken in tablet.
[00:42:34.452 --> 00:42:37.113]  So DNA Force is back 25% off.
[00:42:37.293 --> 00:42:42.415]  And Biome Defense, the amazing probiotic, very best we could come up with with top companies, that is
[00:42:43.712 --> 00:42:47.653]  Also, 25% off, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:42:47.693 --> 00:42:56.616]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:42:56.916 --> 00:43:01.398]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:43:03.467 --> 00:43:13.295]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[00:43:14.135 --> 00:43:23.502]  And today we see the leftists, the globalists, controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[00:43:23.903 --> 00:43:26.865]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[00:43:27.465 --> 00:43:37.154]  Clothing is a statement, and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud, just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:42.818]  So right now, folks, we're gonna debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the InfoWars store.
[00:43:43.879 --> 00:43:45.601]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[00:43:45.662 --> 00:43:46.603]  It's a limited edition.
[00:43:47.163 --> 00:43:49.165]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[00:43:49.406 --> 00:43:56.133]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[00:43:56.454 --> 00:44:00.638]  On the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[00:44:00.879 --> 00:44:02.380]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows
[00:44:03.101 --> 00:44:08.466]  That organizations like CNN are owned by foreign multinational corporations, hell-bent on enslaving this country.
[00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:17.575]  So when you expose them as fake news, you're doing your patriotic duty, and you're exercising your First Amendment in defiance of their bullying, garbage, and tyranny.
[00:44:17.995 --> 00:44:22.139]  And on the back, InfoWars.com is the standard of real news.
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.741]  And of course, this classic?
[00:44:24.441 --> 00:44:25.042]  Says it all.
[00:44:25.142 --> 00:44:26.022]  Need I say more?
[00:44:26.523 --> 00:44:28.124]  You want to have a political message out there?
[00:44:28.164 --> 00:44:33.948]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[00:44:34.269 --> 00:44:37.351]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[00:44:37.811 --> 00:44:43.376]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[00:44:44.096 --> 00:44:46.439]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:55.151]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[00:44:55.412 --> 00:44:58.996]  And this shirt, The Spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:09.284]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Lambe or Come and Take It in good old-fashioned English t-shirts.
[00:45:09.424 --> 00:45:11.906]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[00:45:12.286 --> 00:45:13.908]  InfoWars.com to spread the word.
[00:45:14.648 --> 00:45:15.749]  I designed this baby.
[00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:18.250]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:22.892]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:45:23.292 --> 00:45:27.134]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[00:45:27.534 --> 00:45:30.255]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[00:45:30.275 --> 00:45:31.656]  It's been around about 19 years.
[00:45:32.276 --> 00:45:35.857]  It's the classic InfoWars tyranny response team shirt.
[00:45:36.137 --> 00:45:39.239]  And of course we've seen the NFL taking a knee.
[00:45:40.159 --> 00:45:43.762]  Uh, during the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[00:45:44.462 --> 00:45:45.343]  That's disrespectful.
[00:45:45.383 --> 00:45:49.406]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[00:45:49.466 --> 00:45:56.891]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[00:45:57.311 --> 00:45:58.752]  Our republic is in distress.
[00:45:59.232 --> 00:45:59.693]  Ask me why.
[00:46:00.373 --> 00:46:02.275]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[00:46:02.435 --> 00:46:07.959]  Good old camouflage with the Dayglo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:09.921]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[00:46:09.981 --> 00:46:12.963]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go out and put another shirt on.
[00:46:13.404 --> 00:46:15.565]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[00:46:16.186 --> 00:46:18.428]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[00:46:19.048 --> 00:46:19.909]  It's all about freedom.
[00:46:19.949 --> 00:46:21.290]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[00:46:21.831 --> 00:46:22.732]  Resist Tyranny.
[00:46:23.393 --> 00:46:24.374]  Made in America.
[00:46:24.394 --> 00:46:24.374]  1776.
[00:46:24.894 --> 00:46:28.117]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:29.299]  The backs are really cool.
[00:46:29.639 --> 00:46:30.320]  Look at that back.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:31.281]  That is pure Americana.
[00:46:32.503 --> 00:46:37.647]  And I almost forgot, we've got dozens and dozens of great limited-edition ball caps available.
[00:46:37.767 --> 00:46:38.447]  The Dayglo.
[00:46:38.968 --> 00:46:43.071]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[00:46:43.211 --> 00:46:44.832]  This is my favorite ball cap.
[00:46:45.212 --> 00:46:46.533]  Over 20 ball caps we've put out.
[00:46:46.653 --> 00:46:50.316]  It's got the nice patch, Infowars.com, the Don't Tread On Me.
[00:46:50.576 --> 00:46:53.999]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[00:46:54.419 --> 00:46:56.000]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:01.084]  Thank you all for your support, and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:47:05.804 --> 00:47:08.394]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:33.892 --> 00:47:35.154]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:47:35.194 --> 00:47:36.635]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:47:40.359 --> 00:47:44.223]  The New York Times can truly be called an evil publication.
[00:47:45.104 --> 00:47:49.629]  When I do read it, every page, every headline screams
[00:47:51.584 --> 00:47:54.687]  Deceit, corruption, evil, lies.
[00:47:55.488 --> 00:48:01.093]  The whole paper is dedicated to forcing the United States into an authoritarian world government.
[00:48:01.253 --> 00:48:04.556]  And here's just two examples in today's New York Times.
[00:48:05.177 --> 00:48:12.324]  The cover of the New York Times, mile-long Manhattan truck attack kills eight.
[00:48:14.866 --> 00:48:16.748]  The headline, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:48:18.254 --> 00:48:28.905]  The headline, ladies and gentlemen, should be, Islamic terrorist runs over eight people with a truck in act of terror.
[00:48:30.727 --> 00:48:31.508]  But it gets better.
[00:48:33.189 --> 00:48:39.576]  There's a full-page ad put out by Refuse Fascism, that is a George Soros-funded group.
[00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:41.378]  You cannot make this up.
[00:48:43.993 --> 00:48:46.915]  And it says it begins November 4th.
[00:48:47.216 --> 00:48:48.817]  Overthrow Trump.
[00:48:49.017 --> 00:48:50.538]  Overthrow the government.
[00:48:51.839 --> 00:49:07.351]  But then when I cover the fact that they're planning this big launch November 4th, building up to the one-year anniversary of Trump being elected next week, that I've made it up, there are actual news articles out there saying I made it all up.
[00:49:07.752 --> 00:49:09.173]  Nothing's coming November 4th.
[00:49:10.503 --> 00:49:11.723]  Well, we've already seen Vegas.
[00:49:11.823 --> 00:49:13.204]  It's got Islamic ties, clearly.
[00:49:13.224 --> 00:49:14.904]  And we just saw this last night.
[00:49:16.305 --> 00:49:19.626]  And you better believe it's coming and coming soon.
[00:49:19.986 --> 00:49:22.487]  And you better be aware of it and awake, folks.
[00:49:23.027 --> 00:49:24.807]  We're going to play some key audio.
[00:49:25.688 --> 00:49:29.169]  In fact, it dovetails with that information right now.
[00:49:29.689 --> 00:49:31.429]  Zach called into the show yesterday.
[00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:39.912]  He's been calling in for years, but he recently got out of being attached to the Army Special Forces Command in Florida.
[00:49:41.164 --> 00:49:42.465]  And he didn't give us any secrets.
[00:49:42.505 --> 00:49:44.406]  He talked about what he is a private citizen.
[00:49:45.087 --> 00:49:49.690]  He was talking to his friends about it and what he's researching and the information he's getting.
[00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:53.472]  And the reason I know he's credible is because I get the same information.
[00:49:54.253 --> 00:49:55.434]  Sometimes he has more than I do.
[00:49:55.474 --> 00:49:56.875]  Sometimes I have more than he does.
[00:49:56.915 --> 00:49:58.896]  But he's given us a lot of great information.
[00:49:58.936 --> 00:49:59.576]  Nothing secret.
[00:50:00.177 --> 00:50:04.140]  Just the fact that they're getting a lot of chatter about Islamic attacks coming, which we already see happening.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.402]  Now he was going to come on today for a full hour as a guest.
[00:50:08.533 --> 00:50:21.520]  Soon as he hung up the phone yesterday, he got a call and got called into a meeting for what he was talking about on air and may not be able to talk to us anymore, even though he wasn't giving us anything secret, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:23.376 --> 00:50:26.618]  Because the higher-ups don't want the American people to know what's happening.
[00:50:26.638 --> 00:50:32.383]  They don't want us to stand with the president who's been predicting the Islamic attacks and how it's linked up with the left.
[00:50:32.723 --> 00:50:38.907]  That's why they'll announce their attacks, announce that they're going to cop-kill, announce they're going to get violent, announce they're training militarily.
[00:50:39.168 --> 00:50:40.108]  All the intel's come in.
[00:50:40.128 --> 00:50:41.489]  We've shown you the undercover videos.
[00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:42.170]  All of it.
[00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:44.512]  And then they go, oh, Jones is making that up.
[00:50:44.592 --> 00:50:45.812]  Veritas is making that up.
[00:50:45.873 --> 00:50:46.853]  Louder with the Crowder is making that up.
[00:50:47.093 --> 00:50:48.635]  We're not planning anything November 4th.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.583]  And they've got big, giant articles.
[00:50:52.643 --> 00:50:54.004]  This nightmare must end.
[00:50:54.024 --> 00:50:55.366]  The Trump-Pence regime must go.
[00:50:55.386 --> 00:50:56.848]  November 4th, it begins.
[00:50:57.148 --> 00:50:57.548]  Be there.
[00:50:57.889 --> 00:51:01.213]  Join with thousands who gather in cities and towns across the country.
[00:51:01.493 --> 00:51:09.122]  A movement of protests that continue every day and night, growing until we become millions determined not to stop until the regime is driven from power.
[00:51:11.393 --> 00:51:16.715]  $18 billion put in by George Soros to be led by Linda Sorcer, the pro-sexual mutilation Muslim.
[00:51:17.335 --> 00:51:26.718]  Now let's go ahead, ladies and gentlemen, and go to the intel they don't want you to hear about companies that should be investigated and looked into for what they know.
[00:51:27.671 --> 00:51:32.873]  Because Saudi Arabia has promised, through its surrogates, to carry out terror attacks in Russia and the U.S.
[00:51:32.893 --> 00:51:34.294]  before if we didn't follow their orders.
[00:51:34.914 --> 00:51:36.555]  Quote, in tourist areas.
[00:51:36.795 --> 00:51:38.155]  I'm not saying that's what happened.
[00:51:38.896 --> 00:51:41.457]  This was an Islamic attack last night, though, of Wahhabism.
[00:51:41.617 --> 00:51:42.477]  That's what ISIS is.
[00:51:42.857 --> 00:51:44.398]  So that's a Saudi Arabian gift.
[00:51:45.439 --> 00:51:48.100]  A beautiful thing, as Jake Tapper said.
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.640]  Allah Akbar, so beautiful.
[00:51:50.021 --> 00:51:50.901]  Oh, so beautiful.
[00:51:51.521 --> 00:51:53.102]  So here's the intel they don't want you to hear.
[00:51:54.403 --> 00:51:56.985]  Let's go to Zach in Tampa, Florida.
[00:51:57.005 --> 00:52:01.108]  Zach, you're on the air with Shepard of Intel Hub.
[00:52:01.148 --> 00:52:01.748]  Yes, Alex.
[00:52:01.888 --> 00:52:03.469]  Shepard, it's great to be on with you.
[00:52:03.489 --> 00:52:09.113]  Had to connect some dots because what they pulled off here in Vegas was just too far.
[00:52:09.193 --> 00:52:10.634]  So first and foremost, what we have
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:21.469]  Yeah, so I mean that's that's just part of it so I mean you can't look past that that's obvious but also what we have here is the private military company the Saudi Arabian
[00:52:36.561 --> 00:52:37.922]  That's confirmed too.
[00:52:38.042 --> 00:52:40.084]  Everything the caller is saying is documented.
[00:52:40.104 --> 00:52:42.025]  Because this is the final piece.
[00:52:42.045 --> 00:52:47.009]  You had all this royalty there and you had the Saudi Air Force there that week.
[00:52:48.047 --> 00:52:59.172]  So yeah, this ETS Risk Management Company is a PMC, that's real shady, and they don't work now within the government because who's in the White House, but they did work during Libya with the Clintons.
[00:52:59.493 --> 00:53:03.555]  You know, I got some guys down here in the forensic accounting, if you look into the contracts.
[00:53:03.575 --> 00:53:04.115]  Let's start over.
[00:53:04.175 --> 00:53:07.737]  Zach's recently gotten out of the military and the whole intelligence area, we'll leave it at that.
[00:53:07.957 --> 00:53:10.338]  He's gotten a lot of good info in the past six months.
[00:53:10.578 --> 00:53:12.479]  So just start back over, because this is really important.
[00:53:13.439 --> 00:53:31.424]  Right, so the timeline is pretty unprecedented, let alone with, you know, if you get the $42 million worth of put options done by the George Soros Fund Management Group, and also you have a contract being fulfilled by ETS Risk Management, but this contract was not fulfilled by DOD.
[00:53:31.784 --> 00:53:37.746]  Okay, so this is sort of a, this is where it gets tricky, but they were working and there are PMCs that work
[00:53:38.246 --> 00:53:42.627]  Kind of in vacuums in Libya, in Syria, and they do certain drills stateside as well.
[00:53:43.007 --> 00:53:44.828]  But they were there that weekend.
[00:53:44.908 --> 00:53:46.969]  Everybody knows they were there that weekend.
[00:53:47.089 --> 00:53:54.271]  So this is a private company that is actually ran, and you could pull them up, ETS, but they are ran out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:53:54.451 --> 00:53:58.912]  But they did work during 2013 in Libya and that's fiasco.
[00:53:58.932 --> 00:54:01.993]  So when you're saying, and people bat their eyes saying that this is Islamic,
[00:54:02.413 --> 00:54:10.319]  This is Islamic, not in the sense that it's done by Islamic groups, but in a way, ISIS itself was the creation of these private military groups.
[00:54:10.359 --> 00:54:13.782]  And if you want to, you know, back in the day, they termed like Al-Cieda.
[00:54:13.902 --> 00:54:14.683]  And this is real.
[00:54:15.103 --> 00:54:20.347]  So you have these private military companies that are backed and written by the deep state, you know, creating this chaos around the world.
[00:54:20.928 --> 00:54:28.934]  And with full validation, 100% ETS risk management was on the ground in Vegas that night.
[00:54:28.994 --> 00:54:31.476]  And this gentleman who you have on, he's talking about these choppers.
[00:54:32.473 --> 00:54:34.574]  Um, being in the area, he's spot on.
[00:54:35.275 --> 00:54:38.997]  And the issue, the next thing I got to bring up is the forensic accounting that's going to be brought up.
[00:54:39.577 --> 00:54:43.239]  Because there's individuals that are aware of this in today's day and age.
[00:54:43.837 --> 00:54:51.926]  When you have these transfers, and you're transferring large sums of money, people in the intelligence agencies who are either in or out are not going to stay quiet.
[00:54:52.287 --> 00:54:54.329]  And this is big, and this stuff's coming out right now.
[00:54:54.770 --> 00:55:04.561]  So you have to put everything into perspective in the context of during these wars in Libya and Syria where they're destabilizing the region, there were legitimate private military companies
[00:55:04.981 --> 00:55:05.522]  We're good to go.
[00:55:28.181 --> 00:55:28.501]  I think so.
[00:55:45.856 --> 00:55:54.204]  This is pretty important, and if you notice the timeline, you have a war within what is the White House now, and all these quote-unquote intelligence agencies going on.
[00:55:54.725 --> 00:56:04.655]  On 60 Minutes on Sunday, you also have the Amir of Qatar coming out, okay, who was sanctioned by the Saudis, the Bahrainians, and all this other stuff, and we have our U.S.
[00:56:04.735 --> 00:56:07.618]  assets and our legitimate PMCs in Qatar there.
[00:56:08.198 --> 00:56:14.443]  The Amir of Qatar talked about this, this PMC that he kicked out of his own country and then you have the Saudis attacking him.
[00:56:14.663 --> 00:56:29.254]  And remember three years ago, Bandar Bush threatened the Russians for the Olympics and he threatened the EU that if they didn't go along with the Syria takeover by the ISIS Al Qaeda forces, quote, we'll launch terror attacks inside of your tourist zones.
[00:56:29.754 --> 00:56:32.937]  So is this the same thing the Saudis threatened Russia with?
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:43.643]  100%!
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:43.643]  And the weirdness of it is they have backing, sort of, I mean, there's quasi-backing from the U.S., not the legitimate U.S.
[00:56:43.663 --> 00:56:45.184]  The deep state Obama folks!
[00:56:45.924 --> 00:56:46.524]  Exactly.
[00:56:47.024 --> 00:56:51.586]  This is serious, and I'm just going to tell you right now, and I don't want to rattle anybody,
[00:56:52.166 --> 00:57:03.913]  But between November 1 and November 5, PMC contractors or the, as far as max contracts go, I mean, there's a lot going on in the next, I don't know, six days, five, six days, there's a lot going on.
[00:57:05.134 --> 00:57:10.297]  There's obviously active threats as we speak, but this is a real issue because you technically can't put this stuff and televise it.
[00:57:10.518 --> 00:57:16.561]  How many people you're talking to in the military, the special operations commanding people, how many?
[00:57:18.041 --> 00:57:27.667]  A few minutes left to that video, and so we're going to post the full thing up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the next hour, so you can hear the last two minutes or so of that.
[00:57:27.687 --> 00:57:34.972]  We're going to start the second hour in just a moment, but again, the New York Times says it was a truck attack, not an Islamic attack.
[00:57:35.473 --> 00:57:37.414]  On the cover, this is owned by the Mexican kingpin.
[00:57:37.434 --> 00:57:38.875]  He's not even Mexican.
[00:57:39.935 --> 00:57:42.397]  Just a guy that went down there to oppress everybody and take advantage of them.
[00:57:42.797 --> 00:57:43.738]  And then another one here.
[00:57:44.098 --> 00:57:48.661]  Antifa is announcing that they're launching massive overthrow of Trump starting November 4th.
[00:57:48.701 --> 00:57:49.982]  Full page ad in the New York Times.
[00:57:50.362 --> 00:57:52.063]  But mainstream media says I'm lying about this.
[00:58:00.377 --> 00:58:07.403]  We're not going to stoop to the tactics of this authoritarian communist and fascist, funded by that dirtbag George Soros.
[00:58:07.684 --> 00:58:10.146]  The communists, they can't resist free stuff.
[00:58:10.666 --> 00:58:13.809]  You set up a booth, it says free stuff.
[00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:18.052]  We're going to keep our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, and the American way.
[00:58:18.072 --> 00:58:20.034]  At the same time, we're not going to back down on
[00:58:28.697 --> 00:58:31.178]  What do I do if one of these libtards calls me a Nazi?
[00:58:31.858 --> 00:58:32.359]  That's easy.
[00:58:32.379 --> 00:58:35.000]  You just put a pacifier in his mouth.
[00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:42.423]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:58:42.863 --> 00:58:44.464]  One of these Antifa's get in my face.
[00:58:44.484 --> 00:58:50.007]  I'm gonna pull out my pocket constitution and stick it in his.
[00:58:53.388 --> 00:58:54.008]  Antifa?
[00:58:54.669 --> 00:58:55.309]  Never heard of him.
[00:58:56.949 --> 00:58:57.730]  Never heard of the guy.
[00:58:58.431 --> 00:59:03.698]  They're gonna lose on November 4th and every day after that because they're a bunch of meth-head pieces of crap.
[00:59:04.259 --> 00:59:09.606]  Dude, that's French for p***y. Holding our ground and not letting these bullies push us around.
[00:59:10.527 --> 00:59:11.629]  But not stooping to their level.
[00:59:12.705 --> 00:59:15.727]  We're gonna grab and buy the antifa.
[00:59:15.767 --> 00:59:17.828]  So on November 4th, we gotta do a thing.
[00:59:18.669 --> 00:59:18.909]  A thing?
[00:59:18.929 --> 00:59:19.970]  Yeah, we're gonna do a thing.
[00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:23.352]  America is an information-based civil war.
[00:59:23.732 --> 00:59:25.514]  We're winning that war thanks to you.
[00:59:26.014 --> 00:59:31.137]  And wearing t-shirts and InfoWars ball caps in public is one of the best ways to spread the word.
[00:59:31.458 --> 00:59:34.520]  The revolution starts now with you at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:42.006]  Available right now, our limited edition anti-fascist and anti-communist t-shirt.
[00:59:42.426 --> 00:59:48.532]  Specifically designed to trigger the left this November and beyond.
[00:59:49.032 --> 00:59:49.572]  Order now.
[00:59:49.933 --> 00:59:51.995]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:55.938 --> 00:59:59.861]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:04.415 --> 01:00:09.498]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[01:00:10.438 --> 01:00:12.039]  Government is the problem.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:21.744]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[01:00:22.664 --> 01:00:29.768]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[01:00:30.717 --> 01:00:32.440]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:34.363]  Because there is a war on.
[01:00:34.784 --> 01:00:35.805]  For your mind.
[01:00:37.168 --> 01:00:37.989]  Hello me.
[01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:39.491]  Meet the real me.
[01:00:40.172 --> 01:00:42.276]  In my misfits way of life.
[01:00:43.117 --> 01:00:43.538]  Dark blood.
[01:00:49.336 --> 01:00:53.359]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:00:53.459 --> 01:00:54.900]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.282]  Roger Stone's plane just landed.
[01:00:57.342 --> 01:00:58.482]  He'll be here in about 30 minutes.
[01:00:58.562 --> 01:01:16.134]  I've got incredible congressional testimony by the big social media giant CEOs where they try to act like they're not censoring pro-America and libertarian and conservative and Christian and pro-veteran information and boosting anti-fund BLM cop killer garbage.
[01:01:18.035 --> 01:01:18.736]  That's coming up.
[01:01:20.765 --> 01:01:29.831]  And then they also get put on the hot seat about the fact that they're operating monopolies, but admit that actually the Russians in the aggregate were not pro-Trump.
[01:01:30.512 --> 01:01:33.194]  They were basically hedging their bets and then after Trump won,
[01:01:34.707 --> 01:01:36.709]  They jumped on the anti-Trump bandwagon.
[01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:41.673]  That's because there's a lot of NGOs buying stuff in Russia that is targeted at us.
[01:01:41.953 --> 01:01:46.377]  Just like the CIA will write stuff in foreign papers to have the lies come back here as well.
[01:01:46.617 --> 01:01:49.700]  We don't know where most of this is coming from, just as President Trump has said.
[01:01:50.601 --> 01:01:52.883]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to this Mark Dice report.
[01:01:54.076 --> 01:01:55.417]  I'll play the clip in just a moment.
[01:01:55.617 --> 01:02:10.426]  A great American happened to stumble across a live CNN shoot in Manhattan yesterday and did his duty to God and his country to warn the people who, for some reason, happened to be watching CNN about what it was that they were actually seeing.
[01:02:10.847 --> 01:02:14.009]  I think when the Charlie Hebdo attacks, if memory serves me, there were some.
[01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:17.471]  In some of the attacks in New York that we've seen, there have been that.
[01:02:19.812 --> 01:02:24.535]  If he did make contact with ISIS, they will have instructed him not to just leave a note.
[01:02:24.575 --> 01:02:26.136]  You really gotta hand it to Anderson Cooper.
[01:02:26.297 --> 01:02:27.297]  He's a pretty good actor.
[01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:33.221]  He didn't even break character while the guy was just two feet away from him, yelling that CNN was fake news.
[01:02:33.461 --> 01:02:36.803]  Of course, they're on the scene where yesterday another Muslim immigrant did.
[01:02:37.023 --> 01:02:38.024]  Well, you know what.
[01:02:38.484 --> 01:02:44.228]  And many are wondering, and perhaps this driver was inspired by this Democrat campaign ad,
[01:02:44.488 --> 01:02:45.970]  Which has recently gone viral.
[01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:50.614]  Which has even been covered on all the major media outlets because it's so despicable.
[01:02:51.015 --> 01:02:55.499]  Which depicts a Republican candidate's fan, Ed Gillespie.
[01:02:55.519 --> 01:02:56.600]  He's the Republican candidate.
[01:02:57.021 --> 01:03:03.808]  It depicts one of his fans driving a big pickup truck and running down a bunch of minority children.
[01:03:04.088 --> 01:03:09.872]  Notice the Confederate flag waving on the back of the truck, trying to evoke the horrific tragedy in Charlottesville a few months ago.
[01:03:09.892 --> 01:03:19.240]  And it certainly is reasonable to suspect that perhaps this perpetrator had seen this ad and then decided to go and carry out exactly that kind of an attack.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:24.984]  Even the far left waste of paper, the Washington Post, the Washington Compost, was disgusted by the ad.
[01:03:25.344 --> 01:03:28.867]  It says, an ad that has no place in the Virginia governor's race.
[01:03:29.247 --> 01:03:30.007]  Oh wait, what's this?
[01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:33.829]  Political Action Committee polls controversial Virginia governor ad.
[01:03:34.009 --> 01:03:36.670]  We knew our ad would ruffle feathers, they said in a statement.
[01:03:37.051 --> 01:03:41.793]  We held up a mirror to the Republican Party, and they don't like what they see.
[01:03:42.153 --> 01:03:49.196]  We have decided to poll our ad at this time, said Crystal Ball J. Alex, president of the Latino Victory Fund.
[01:03:49.757 --> 01:03:54.659]  Given the recent events, of course, oh gee, which events are you talking about there, Crystal Ball?
[01:03:55.259 --> 01:04:02.943]  We will be placing other powerful ads into rotation that highlight the reasons we need to elect progressive leaders in Virginia.
[01:04:03.163 --> 01:04:05.065]  Of course, they didn't apologize for the ad.
[01:04:05.305 --> 01:04:14.650]  They still just blamed Republicans for the ad when their ad could have very well incited this ISIS sympathizer to kill those people in New York yesterday.
[01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:18.911]  It looks like the producers of this ad actually cast some of the actors in the wrong roles.
[01:04:19.251 --> 01:04:30.813]  They did have a Muslim in the ad, if you'll recall, who was walking home from school with her black friend, who didn't do nothing, of course, when they were then chased down to be murdered by the evil white person driving the truck.
[01:04:30.893 --> 01:04:36.014]  But it looks like the white person driving the truck and the Muslim roles were flipped around in the ad.
[01:04:36.134 --> 01:04:43.216]  Because, as you know, it's Muslims who, 99.9% of the time, are the ones who mow down people in vehicles for a lot.
[01:04:43.556 --> 01:04:50.222]  In other news, we have plenty more anti-white hate crimes which continue to be ignored by the mainstream media, so let's just cover one of them now.
[01:04:50.743 --> 01:05:02.934]  In Philadelphia, this black thug just approached this random white woman who was just walking along the street when he decided to kick her and then punch her, knocking her out cold just for fun, just to play the...

[01:05:38.437 --> 01:05:45.343]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.

[01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:32.792]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:33.233 --> 01:06:38.360]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:54.449 --> 01:06:57.272]  That's the Dave Mustaine and good old Megadeth bringing us in.
[01:06:57.312 --> 01:06:58.312]  The threat is real.
[01:06:58.352 --> 01:06:59.654]  The jihad threat is real.
[01:07:00.434 --> 01:07:02.556]  It is allied with George Soros and the globalists.
[01:07:03.537 --> 01:07:13.586]  They are the same people funding the entire Antifa movement that is anti-free speech, anti-America, and the essence of authoritarianism.
[01:07:14.867 --> 01:07:17.109]  Refuse Fascism is the organization
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.602]  Created and run by the very same lady that created Occupy Wall Street.
[01:07:21.622 --> 01:07:28.025]  We'll be talking to one of the producers, Jack, about that in a minute because he made some good points during the break and I said make those on air.
[01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:47.275]  And another one of the producers in there running the video board is Matt and he was bringing up some really good points last week about this Papanopolis and how if you read the indictment they act like they've got all these goods but even the indictment admits
[01:07:48.516 --> 01:07:58.701]  That Papanopoulos kept bringing stuff to the Trump campaign about Russians, and every time they said, no, we have nothing to do with the Russians.
[01:07:59.261 --> 01:08:00.842]  It actually exonerates Trump.
[01:08:01.402 --> 01:08:05.544]  The only person, it seems, in this government not in bed with foreign governments is Trump.
[01:08:08.406 --> 01:08:11.267]  And it turns out, ladies and gentlemen, wait till you hear this.
[01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:12.407]  This is mainstream news.
[01:08:13.028 --> 01:08:17.350]  We did a video over the weekend, Matt and I did,
[01:08:18.979 --> 01:08:24.844]  Breaking down the fact that the evidence points towards him being the mole just in the indictment.
[01:08:25.724 --> 01:08:26.965]  Well, now guess what?
[01:08:27.005 --> 01:08:30.468]  He's connected to the PP dossier from day one.
[01:08:30.929 --> 01:08:38.014]  And if you don't think the Democrats try to put plants in people's campaigns, you don't know what planet you're living on.
[01:08:38.054 --> 01:08:41.097]  This is 101 of even local politics.
[01:08:41.377 --> 01:08:42.558]  You're running for city council?
[01:08:42.938 --> 01:08:44.139]  They're gonna, in a big city?
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:47.422]  They're gonna put four or five plants in your organization.
[01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:51.191]  If you're running for Congress, they're gonna try to put 20!
[01:08:52.312 --> 01:08:52.973]  You're a Senator?
[01:08:54.154 --> 01:08:55.475]  Oh, you're a President?
[01:08:56.056 --> 01:08:58.378]  Or you're running for President, and you're a frontrunner?
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:05.364]  Just like this lady's a Democratic operative, the Russian lawyer that met with Donald Trump Jr.
[01:09:05.945 --> 01:09:06.545]  Don Jr.
[01:09:06.806 --> 01:09:07.426]  Donnie Jr.
[01:09:08.187 --> 01:09:09.308]  He's there, 10-minute meeting.
[01:09:09.348 --> 01:09:11.030]  Okay, you got evidence Hillary's working with the Russians?
[01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:11.470]  Give it to me.
[01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:13.472]  That's what you're supposed to do as a patriot!
[01:09:14.676 --> 01:09:18.160]  And she just kept trying to get into other subjects about influence and stuff.
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.002]  He said, no, I'm here to hear about corruption.
[01:09:20.282 --> 01:09:21.143]  Boom, I'm out of the meeting.
[01:09:21.484 --> 01:09:22.785]  You didn't give us what you were supposed to.
[01:09:24.447 --> 01:09:25.748]  So it's simply amazing.
[01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:29.673]  Matt, let's go to you first.
[01:09:29.733 --> 01:09:31.275]  This is really obvious.
[01:09:32.438 --> 01:09:36.260]  What's going on here with good old, good old Papanopoulos?
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.321]  And of course, we now know that Mueller is very corrupt.
[01:09:39.681 --> 01:09:41.902]  Even mainstream news admits that he's like a pit bull.
[01:09:42.242 --> 01:09:45.684]  He would falsely charge suspect's wife to apply pressure.
[01:09:45.984 --> 01:09:51.747]  He broke all sorts of laws in the Constitution in the way he supposedly got all this fake info.
[01:09:52.267 --> 01:09:54.968]  So, we know who their witness is to the grand jury.
[01:09:55.408 --> 01:09:56.469]  It's Papanopoulos.
[01:09:57.169 --> 01:10:01.731]  This whole thing stinks to high heaven, just like fake informants, and it's starting to unravel really quick.
[01:10:03.194 --> 01:10:14.362]  Yeah, so Papadopoulos, we shot a video on Monday that we broke down why we thought Papadopoulos just kind of stinks as a mole.
[01:10:15.022 --> 01:10:28.272]  And the reason we thought that, a few different things, but yeah, he was repeatedly shot down in his attempts to try and connect the Trump campaign with senior Russian officials, which also looked fishy because the senior Russian official
[01:10:28.852 --> 01:10:29.413]  We're good to go.
[01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:48.138]  Relating to Russia, he was assigned to matters involving Greece, which actually is the origin of his surname, Papadopoulos.
[01:10:48.238 --> 01:10:49.640]  It's the most common surname in Greece.
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:51.662]  It's like Jones or Smith.
[01:10:52.042 --> 01:10:52.402]  Exactly.
[01:10:52.422 --> 01:10:53.643]  Was I pronouncing it right earlier?
[01:10:54.064 --> 01:10:54.825]  Yeah, Papadopoulos.
[01:10:54.845 --> 01:10:55.525]  Papadopoulos.
[01:10:55.786 --> 01:10:56.206]  Something like that.
[01:10:56.226 --> 01:10:58.148]  Sounds like a really good restaurant I go to sometimes.
[01:10:58.909 --> 01:10:59.229]  It does.
[01:11:02.074 --> 01:11:16.498]  Now what really confirms our suspicions, uh, that we were talking about on Monday in that video that we did, um, after the show, uh, is it's come out that he's now, uh, friends.
[01:11:16.558 --> 01:11:18.819]  He's Sergi Milan.
[01:11:20.099 --> 01:11:30.146]  The source of the Steele dirty dossier that's been discredited, widely discredited, turns out that Papadopoulos is intimate friends with him on Facebook.
[01:11:30.266 --> 01:11:41.334]  And when I say that, I mean that Papadopoulos only has a network of 240 friends on Facebook, and this Sergi Milan is one of them.
[01:11:41.854 --> 01:11:45.737]  It also turns out that they were in regular contact with one another.
[01:11:46.818 --> 01:12:05.717]  Additionally, one of the things that I read about this that just looks super funny, you know, it's just super suspicious when someone emails in an email thread in your campaign, I think the headline verbatim was,
[01:12:08.154 --> 01:12:11.637]  ...set up meeting with Russian officials, including Putin.
[01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:14.739]  Like, that just, that looks suspicious.
[01:12:14.799 --> 01:12:15.520]  It looks silly.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.441]  It almost looks like a scam.
[01:12:16.481 --> 01:12:18.542]  Sure, the whole thing, in fact, it's worse than that, the stuff they say.
[01:12:18.562 --> 01:12:19.243]  It goes on and on.
[01:12:19.503 --> 01:12:20.504]  We'll have influence.
[01:12:21.044 --> 01:12:22.305]  Putin wants to back Trump.
[01:12:22.345 --> 01:12:23.026]  He's our boy.
[01:12:23.366 --> 01:12:25.528]  The whole thing is a complete setup.
[01:12:25.628 --> 01:12:26.789]  We know it's a setup.
[01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:28.811]  We know that's how the swamp operates.
[01:12:29.291 --> 01:12:30.852]  The same thing happened to me when I was in
[01:12:31.693 --> 01:12:36.477]  When I was in eighth grade, I was not a drug user, but I'd smoked marijuana before.
[01:12:37.357 --> 01:12:40.420]  And they were busting lots of kids for smoking marijuana.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:46.244]  And this one kid in the field house kept saying, just buy a joint from me in the morning.
[01:12:46.984 --> 01:12:49.406]  Please buy the joint from me in the morning.
[01:12:49.807 --> 01:12:50.127]  Please.
[01:12:50.267 --> 01:12:51.228]  And I said, no.
[01:12:51.788 --> 01:12:56.572]  Well, the next day, he follows me in a bathroom at first period and says, here, please buy it.
[01:12:56.892 --> 01:12:57.652]  And I went, whoa.
[01:12:58.593 --> 01:13:00.073]  And I took it and threw it in the toilet.
[01:13:00.394 --> 01:13:04.575]  They still called me to the office and said, we know you just bought a marijuana cigarette.
[01:13:05.015 --> 01:13:06.796]  And I said, no, I threw it in the toilet.
[01:13:06.836 --> 01:13:07.596]  Your guy did it.
[01:13:07.636 --> 01:13:08.276]  You shut him up.
[01:13:08.576 --> 01:13:10.637]  They went, are you like an organized criminal?
[01:13:10.677 --> 01:13:11.737]  You're saying no to us?
[01:13:12.357 --> 01:13:14.018]  Who told you how to lie like this?
[01:13:14.038 --> 01:13:15.278]  And I went, you people are crazy.
[01:13:15.298 --> 01:13:20.860]  And they were really mad that I'd been in a bunch of fights and stuff and thought I was a trouble kid or whatever, because I'd fight back against, you know.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.941]  Gangs that were, you know, just going around beating up the white kids.
[01:13:23.961 --> 01:13:24.682]  I mean, that's what it was.
[01:13:25.062 --> 01:13:27.343]  And I'm not against black people, but that's what was going on.
[01:13:27.363 --> 01:13:28.444]  They were racist, some of them.
[01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:29.584]  A lot of my friends were black.
[01:13:29.604 --> 01:13:32.866]  The point was, is that they just wanted to teach me a lesson.
[01:13:32.906 --> 01:13:34.587]  They were white principals.
[01:13:35.127 --> 01:13:36.848]  And they just got completely upset.
[01:13:36.868 --> 01:13:37.929]  But it was so obvious.
[01:13:38.309 --> 01:13:40.190]  You say, what's that have to do with Papanopoulos?
[01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:44.873]  Well, it's so obvious when somebody's in your organization going, just please buy an illegal gun from me.
[01:13:45.493 --> 01:13:47.534]  Or just please buy drugs from me once.
[01:13:47.614 --> 01:13:49.554]  Or, you know, let's just do something illegal.
[01:13:49.654 --> 01:13:51.014]  I mean, it's very obvious.
[01:13:51.394 --> 01:13:58.676]  I've had informants and people, they don't do it anymore, show up at public events and go, Alex, I want to bomb the police station.
[01:13:59.096 --> 01:14:00.717]  Do you agree we should bomb the police?
[01:14:01.597 --> 01:14:03.757]  And then it turns out it's some federal informant.
[01:14:04.057 --> 01:14:05.378]  So they're incredibly dirty.
[01:14:05.718 --> 01:14:06.678]  It's how they operate.
[01:14:06.758 --> 01:14:09.119]  I wonder what they had on Papanopoulos before.
[01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:12.099]  Or I wonder if they inserted him on purpose.
[01:14:12.479 --> 01:14:14.400]  But he's got to know they normally burn
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:21.863]  They're infiltrators at this level to discredit them in case they ever turn around and tell what happened.
[01:14:21.903 --> 01:14:31.228]  I mean he's got to know his days are numbered being the bag man and the dirt man for old, I mean if it's true, we're just speculating here of course, for old Mueller.
[01:14:31.268 --> 01:14:31.708]  What do you think?
[01:14:32.088 --> 01:14:33.229]  Well, I think that's in the cards for him.
[01:14:33.269 --> 01:14:38.374]  I don't know who'd want to work with this guy in the future because he just seems like a weasel at this point.
[01:14:39.255 --> 01:14:54.069]  The other thing that is interesting to note is that it's being reported that they think that he wore a wire as early as July of last year in cooperation with Mueller's investigation and with these indictments that came out on Monday,
[01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:58.767]  The only thing they have is unrelated to the actual campaign.
[01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:04.349]  Again, they're trying to put pressure on Gates and Manafort.
[01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:10.812]  I mean, the word is, and I knew this six months ago, not filing proper tax forms for offshore corporations.
[01:15:11.193 --> 01:15:17.776]  Paid the taxes, just didn't file the proper forms that now Podesta and his brother just filed a few months ago because they know this is going on.
[01:15:18.116 --> 01:15:18.816]  Retroactively.
[01:15:19.236 --> 01:15:20.157]  Yes, retroactively.
[01:15:20.677 --> 01:15:21.898]  So he still committed the offense?
[01:15:22.478 --> 01:15:22.839]  That's it.
[01:15:23.459 --> 01:15:33.471]  And you know, I've also been told they're looking into things like, did junior campaign people divert funds for their own hotels or plane tickets or food?
[01:15:33.611 --> 01:15:40.178]  I mean, it's like they're looking for crooked toenails and somebody that lied about it or forgot about it.
[01:15:40.879 --> 01:15:41.739]  And that's all they're doing.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.520]  Alright, great point.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.202]  Roger Stone's coming in studio, bottom of the hour, in studio.
[01:15:47.022 --> 01:15:54.226]  And we're gonna come back and Matt's gonna pop in too about who is behind this whole Antifa movement with the Soros money.
[01:15:54.686 --> 01:15:58.568]  The same folks that were behind Occupy Wall Street refused fascism.
[01:15:59.068 --> 01:16:00.849]  They got a full page ad in the New York Times.

[01:20:58.035 --> 01:21:01.653]  I have a tendency to wash my hands during a break.
[01:21:02.894 --> 01:21:05.416]  Uh, and then to not drive them.
[01:21:06.016 --> 01:21:10.359]  So I walk in here, and Roger puts his hand out, and I'm like, okay, well they're wet.
[01:21:10.379 --> 01:21:11.660]  He goes, that doesn't matter as long as they're clean.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.764]  So we're like now, not blood brothers, but I guess, you know, we've shared the watery hands.
[01:21:17.824 --> 01:21:19.365]  It's a secret cult, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:19.725 --> 01:21:22.227]  Okay, I'm being really- Donald Trump started this, actually.
[01:21:22.287 --> 01:21:25.229]  He is the most obsessive hand washer of all time.
[01:21:25.829 --> 01:21:30.813]  I guess when you shake millions of hands running for president, you gotta do that, or you constantly have a cold.
[01:21:31.313 --> 01:21:32.494]  He's adamant about it.
[01:21:33.815 --> 01:21:34.816]  Getting serious here.
[01:21:36.337 --> 01:21:36.958]  You just got here.
[01:21:36.978 --> 01:21:39.720]  You just walked in off the airplane, so we haven't even talked yet.
[01:21:40.981 --> 01:21:42.543]  What on earth is going on?
[01:21:42.623 --> 01:21:43.343]  Terror attacks?
[01:21:43.363 --> 01:21:44.925]  The New York Times won't say it's a terror attack.
[01:21:45.145 --> 01:21:46.066]  They call it a truck attack.
[01:21:46.446 --> 01:21:52.551]  Antifa says they're going to start overthrowing the government in full-page ads funded by Soros in the New York Times starting November 4th.
[01:21:52.831 --> 01:21:57.535]  And there are literally dozens of articles saying, I'm insane, nothing's coming November 4th.
[01:21:58.056 --> 01:21:59.297]  What is going on with these people?
[01:21:59.477 --> 01:22:01.038]  Yeah, you've been Paul Revere on this.
[01:22:01.098 --> 01:22:05.061]  You have been predicting this now literally for months based on your own sources.
[01:22:06.001 --> 01:22:14.146]  I think it's a hysteria because in middle America, in flyover country, Donald Trump is very popular.
[01:22:14.487 --> 01:22:16.048]  I was in Washington yesterday.
[01:22:16.068 --> 01:22:21.031]  I was able to see some proprietary polling taken by the Republican National Committee
[01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:27.392]  And it showed that if the election were run again tomorrow, Alex, Donald Trump would win again.
[01:22:27.492 --> 01:22:31.453]  He's actually marginally more popular than he was on election day.
[01:22:32.053 --> 01:22:34.793]  The erosion is in the support for Hillary Clinton.
[01:22:35.173 --> 01:22:39.894]  Four out of ten Clinton supporters now say that they're not sure they would vote for her again.
[01:22:40.795 --> 01:22:48.716]  And this, of course, is so against type, so against the mainstream media narrative, that they're going out of their minds.
[01:22:50.262 --> 01:22:51.002]  It's emerging.
[01:22:51.022 --> 01:22:52.143]  We just went over the evidence earlier.
[01:22:52.163 --> 01:22:54.905]  I'm going to do a special report tonight on this.
[01:22:54.925 --> 01:22:57.626]  It's going to air during the War Room with Owen Schroer and yourself.
[01:22:58.446 --> 01:22:59.567]  Just collating all the evidence.
[01:22:59.587 --> 01:23:09.012]  There's so much that Papanopoulos was a plant from the beginning by the deep state, by Mueller, wearing wires as early as July.
[01:23:09.592 --> 01:23:11.393]  And even with that, it's in the indictment.
[01:23:11.413 --> 01:23:14.075]  He kept trying to steer them into Russia meetings and they didn't bite.
[01:23:14.515 --> 01:23:19.558]  I mean, if you really get into the evidence, their indictment is the evidence that Trump did nothing.
[01:23:19.938 --> 01:23:25.440]  Well, and in fact, his whole pedigree is as a neocon.
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:43.267]  He goes from a series of think tanks, all of which, like the Jamestown Institute, the Hudson Institute, all of them, you know, virulently anti-Russia, and then suddenly, overnight, who's advocating meetings with the Russians at the highest level but this guy Papadopoulos?
[01:23:44.247 --> 01:23:46.548]  I am told that Manafort spotted him early.
[01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:48.609]  He just looks like a worm!
[01:23:48.809 --> 01:23:53.193]  Yeah, no, and he was evidently wearing a wire for at least three months.
[01:23:53.213 --> 01:23:56.817]  Let me ask this, what is the Trump campaign doing with people that look like that?
[01:23:56.917 --> 01:23:58.879]  I mean, I would run from that guy.
[01:23:59.099 --> 01:24:01.762]  Well, it's important to understand... I mean, he looks like a nerdy well.
[01:24:02.362 --> 01:24:04.344]  He does look a little strange, doesn't he?
[01:24:04.885 --> 01:24:05.966]  Well, you know how those Greeks are.
[01:24:06.006 --> 01:24:06.426]  Look at that.
[01:24:06.747 --> 01:24:06.887]  Wow.
[01:24:07.647 --> 01:24:08.828]  We love Griggs.
[01:24:08.848 --> 01:24:09.269]  Yes we do.
[01:24:09.289 --> 01:24:11.170]  Griggs said we're good looking, that guy is good looking.
[01:24:11.230 --> 01:24:13.332]  Spiro Agnew is the one I was thinking of.
[01:24:13.352 --> 01:24:14.753]  He looks like a little jihadi or something.
[01:24:14.933 --> 01:24:15.954]  He does look strange.
[01:24:16.294 --> 01:24:34.549]  I guess the point here is that in a presidential campaign, when the media is beating on you for having, you know, no issue operation, no heft, you put together these largely paper, honorific advisory panels and they can have a hundred people on them.
[01:24:35.349 --> 01:24:41.173]  But in this case, the group that Papadopoulos belonged to met one time.
[01:24:41.673 --> 01:24:44.395]  I don't believe they ever met with the candidate.
[01:24:45.056 --> 01:24:46.517]  The guy had no authority.
[01:24:46.577 --> 01:24:47.677]  He wasn't on the payroll.
[01:24:47.978 --> 01:24:56.403]  He didn't even have a credential, you know, a security pass to get into the headquarters, which in a general election is kind of tightly controlled.
[01:24:56.783 --> 01:25:01.346]  So he is a marginal player, to put it mildly.
[01:25:01.426 --> 01:25:01.867]  I think the
[01:25:02.367 --> 01:25:02.568]  I think?
[01:25:18.111 --> 01:25:20.113]  You've got them completely involved with Russia.
[01:25:20.234 --> 01:25:20.934]  Uranium One.
[01:25:21.595 --> 01:25:27.941]  John Podesta is now making almost daily tweets saying, Alex Jones, eat sh-you-know-what.
[01:25:28.061 --> 01:25:28.322]  Yes.
[01:25:28.902 --> 01:25:30.063]  You know, you're going to get it.
[01:25:31.425 --> 01:25:35.489]  Which is a threat, but strangely enough, Podesta hasn't been banned on Twitter.
[01:25:35.529 --> 01:25:38.912]  You see, I've been banned over allegedly threatening people.
[01:25:38.932 --> 01:25:40.574]  I was about to say, the word is you are now going to sue.
[01:25:40.974 --> 01:25:41.855]  Oh, there's no question.
[01:25:41.915 --> 01:25:45.536]  I went to Washington yesterday to meet with a number of... And that's Twitter.
[01:25:45.997 --> 01:25:46.337]  Twitter.
[01:25:47.477 --> 01:25:54.081]  And I may be joined in this by others because our friend Milo has also been... And you know, I've been going around to the lawyers.
[01:25:54.121 --> 01:25:55.061]  We have good cases.
[01:25:55.101 --> 01:25:59.344]  I just haven't taken the leap yet on who I need to sue just to defend free speech.
[01:25:59.744 --> 01:26:01.044]  But it's amazing that...
[01:26:02.185 --> 01:26:08.047]  You know, Keith Olbermann can threaten to burn my house down with me in it, but he's still on Twitter.
[01:26:08.607 --> 01:26:12.208]  John Podesta can threaten you, Alex, but he's still on Twitter.
[01:26:12.508 --> 01:26:14.869]  Talk about a liberal double standard.
[01:26:15.349 --> 01:26:16.530]  Look, I'm going to own Twitter.
[01:26:16.570 --> 01:26:20.091]  Why do you think Podesta's making all these horrible statements just suddenly?
[01:26:20.111 --> 01:26:22.412]  He hardly ever tweets, and now, why is he so angry at me?
[01:26:23.793 --> 01:26:24.553]  It's hard to say.
[01:26:24.593 --> 01:26:29.397]  I think he understands that his vulnerability is going to come to the fore here.
[01:26:29.938 --> 01:26:32.640]  And he keeps trying to divert to Pizzagate.
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:37.224]  Sorry, I've never written, spoken, said anything whatsoever about Pizzagate.
[01:26:37.264 --> 01:26:40.106]  I think we concluded it was a false flag.
[01:26:40.226 --> 01:26:44.590]  And we're the ones that pointed out it was a false flag, so they're trying to blame me as a progenitor.
[01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:53.112]  But just because Pizzagate turns out to be bogus doesn't mean that the entire issue of pedophilia is false.
[01:26:53.232 --> 01:26:55.613]  And notice that's exploded onto the scene with Hollywood.
[01:26:55.853 --> 01:26:56.493]  Extraordinary.
[01:26:56.853 --> 01:26:58.234]  What do you make of this timing?
[01:26:58.614 --> 01:27:01.675]  The NFL, Hollywood, it's all literally collapsing.
[01:27:02.375 --> 01:27:04.456]  I don't think there's even forces behind the scenes doing it.
[01:27:04.736 --> 01:27:09.059]  I just think America's waking up, they're angry, they're not asleep anymore, and they're speaking out.
[01:27:09.419 --> 01:27:22.206]  Very interestingly that, you know, I came on The War Room and I laid out a scenario by which the president should demand that Jeff Sessions appoint a special counsel to look into Uranium One.
[01:27:22.906 --> 01:27:37.011]  This would have the net effect of putting Mr. Mueller, Mr. Comey, Mr. McCabe, the Associate Director of the FBI, and Rod Rosenstein, the de facto Attorney General of the United States... In the hot seat where they deserve to be!
[01:27:37.071 --> 01:27:37.271]  Right.
[01:27:37.711 --> 01:27:40.534]  Immediately, a piece on Vanity Fair yesterday.
[01:27:40.594 --> 01:27:42.796]  Headline, why Roger Stone's plan won't work.
[01:27:43.317 --> 01:27:48.301]  A piece on Raw Story, the worst of the worst fake news left-wing seats.
[01:27:48.341 --> 01:27:50.343]  Why Roger Stone's plan is falling apart.
[01:27:50.784 --> 01:27:53.066]  You just told us what you fear.
[01:27:53.206 --> 01:27:55.869]  You fear this move by Donald Trump.
[01:27:56.389 --> 01:28:00.954]  I think General Kelly signaled it yesterday in his great interview with Laura Ingraham.
[01:28:01.754 --> 01:28:09.198]  I think the President kind of revealed it in his tweet saying, why isn't the focus on Crook and Hillary?
[01:28:09.558 --> 01:28:13.840]  This is the plan that turns the tables on the Inquisitors.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:19.863]  And by the way, if we weren't over the target, the old World War II sham for bombardiers, we wouldn't be under massive attack.
[01:28:20.243 --> 01:28:23.765]  I'm not ready to tell folks about it yet, but you're here for us to meet, strategize.
[01:28:24.918 --> 01:28:28.262]  You're being sued by the law firm of Obama.
[01:28:28.663 --> 01:28:29.744]  He admits he put him up to it.
[01:28:30.585 --> 01:28:31.686]  I have Al Gore.
[01:28:31.966 --> 01:28:32.908]  I'm not ready to get to it.
[01:28:33.048 --> 01:28:37.113]  Al Gore is directly... I don't want to say it yet.
[01:28:37.493 --> 01:28:38.194]  I'm actually proud.
[01:28:39.884 --> 01:28:40.924]  Wait till I tell you about this.
[01:28:41.184 --> 01:28:42.165]  I just learned about it last night.
[01:28:42.185 --> 01:28:43.685]  I mean, can you believe it?
[01:28:43.925 --> 01:28:45.406]  Al Gore, man, he's got a lot of nerve.
[01:28:46.226 --> 01:28:47.366]  And what's the allegation?
[01:28:47.406 --> 01:28:48.307]  What is he upset at you about?
[01:28:48.387 --> 01:28:49.307]  I'll tell you about it later.
[01:28:49.347 --> 01:28:51.068]  I'm not sure the lawyers don't want us to go public with it yet.
[01:28:51.208 --> 01:28:53.388]  I've been up against Al Gore before.
[01:28:53.408 --> 01:28:54.029]  This will be delightful.
[01:28:54.049 --> 01:28:54.689]  We are on the march.
[01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:57.530]  The empire is on the run.
[01:28:58.050 --> 01:29:00.831]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:03.069 --> 01:29:07.394]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[01:29:07.854 --> 01:29:12.899]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:17.364]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[01:29:17.404 --> 01:29:20.687]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[01:29:21.348 --> 01:29:25.810]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:29.712]  It's you, the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[01:29:30.392 --> 01:29:38.116]  I came in here an hour ago, and I literally just went to Infowarsstore.com and printed the five-star reviews.
[01:29:39.036 --> 01:29:39.917]  The first few pages.
[01:29:40.217 --> 01:29:44.021]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[01:29:44.602 --> 01:29:48.085]  And it's five-star after five-star after five-star.
[01:29:48.446 --> 01:29:50.148]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[01:29:50.608 --> 01:29:56.935]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:29:56.975 --> 01:29:57.876]  Let's go over them right now.
[01:29:58.416 --> 01:29:59.917]  This is verified by our Mark.
[01:30:00.118 --> 01:30:03.060]  Five-star review for Anthroplex is for men and women.
[01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:04.581]  I take it as directed.
[01:30:04.601 --> 01:30:15.511]  As one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[01:30:16.051 --> 01:30:16.752]  Easy does it.
[01:30:16.832 --> 01:30:17.833]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[01:30:17.853 --> 01:30:18.814]  It's very, very serious.
[01:30:19.214 --> 01:30:19.634]  Not a game.
[01:30:19.654 --> 01:30:20.075]  Thank you, Mark.
[01:30:20.575 --> 01:30:21.856]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[01:30:21.996 --> 01:30:22.796]  Energy all day.
[01:30:23.236 --> 01:30:30.519]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[01:30:30.959 --> 01:30:31.660]  Another review.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:32.680]  I love this one.
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:35.421]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[01:30:35.801 --> 01:30:39.323]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[01:30:39.603 --> 01:30:42.524]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[01:30:42.904 --> 01:30:44.445]  Here's another one ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:44.825 --> 01:30:48.186]  Five star review for Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[01:30:48.466 --> 01:30:51.647]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[01:30:51.707 --> 01:30:52.407]  I don't get sick.
[01:30:53.087 --> 01:30:56.428]  Last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[01:30:56.569 --> 01:30:57.549]  Amazing product.
[01:30:58.289 --> 01:31:00.370]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:01.811]  Here's one from Brian.
[01:31:02.111 --> 01:31:04.192]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[01:31:04.312 --> 01:31:05.153]  Thank you all.
[01:31:05.553 --> 01:31:09.195]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[01:31:09.275 --> 01:31:11.476]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[01:31:11.876 --> 01:31:13.817]  Every night owl should have this product.
[01:31:14.317 --> 01:31:17.759]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[01:31:18.019 --> 01:31:18.660]  And I should add,
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:20.601]  That's a great name for this product.
[01:31:20.861 --> 01:31:22.681]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[01:31:22.702 --> 01:31:24.402]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[01:31:24.762 --> 01:31:26.083]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[01:31:26.163 --> 01:31:27.764]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[01:31:27.804 --> 01:31:28.364]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[01:31:28.624 --> 01:31:30.265]  I said I'd shut up!
[01:31:30.285 --> 01:31:31.045]  But back to the script.
[01:31:31.405 --> 01:31:33.286]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[01:31:33.306 --> 01:31:34.047]  I love that name too.
[01:31:34.487 --> 01:31:36.508]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[01:31:36.808 --> 01:31:41.010]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[01:31:41.050 --> 01:31:43.631]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[01:31:43.691 --> 01:31:45.112]  You make it literally possible.
[01:31:46.172 --> 01:31:50.978]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million colloidal silver out there.
[01:31:51.518 --> 01:31:54.341]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[01:31:54.622 --> 01:31:58.186]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[01:31:58.686 --> 01:32:01.049]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be though, kind of.
[01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:04.391]  I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[01:32:04.751 --> 01:32:06.853]  This was the first product I purchased from Inforestore.
[01:32:07.193 --> 01:32:13.057]  Whenever I feel the first haze of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[01:32:13.477 --> 01:32:19.221]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015, and it's worked for everyone.
[01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:26.086]  It has become an expected gift for our family, and that's why we get you the best products, because we want to repeat customers.
[01:32:26.346 --> 01:32:27.166]  It's all a win-win.
[01:32:27.327 --> 01:32:28.227]  That's an awesome review.
[01:32:28.267 --> 01:32:31.049]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family.
[01:32:31.489 --> 01:32:33.531]  Well, I got 20 seconds left, folks.
[01:32:33.591 --> 01:32:36.553]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Caveman reviews.
[01:32:36.573 --> 01:32:37.774]  They're all five-star.
[01:32:38.014 --> 01:32:43.378]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[01:32:44.018 --> 01:32:47.301]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[01:32:47.581 --> 01:32:49.382]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[01:32:49.683 --> 01:32:53.205]  Find it all, folks, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:53.245 --> 01:32:58.349]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[01:33:05.262 --> 01:33:11.469]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.454 --> 01:33:21.180]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:22.061 --> 01:33:23.542]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:40.097]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:40.218 --> 01:33:40.820]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.748]  we're live and we've launched the War Room with
[01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:47.854]  Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others weekdays 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:48.475 --> 01:33:54.800]  and of course we have David Knight with the real news and analysis of what's happening in our world every weekday morning 8 a.m.
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:55.381]  to 11 a.m.
[01:33:55.401 --> 01:33:57.142]  and I'm gonna launch a lot of other shows.
[01:33:57.502 --> 01:34:02.266]  I'm hiring more people, more producers, more camera operators, more researchers, more journalists.
[01:34:02.346 --> 01:34:07.891]  It takes money to do that and it takes money to battle like he's doing
[01:34:09.813 --> 01:34:12.255]  Sued by Obama, saying he's a Russian agent.
[01:34:12.555 --> 01:34:13.536]  No proof.
[01:34:13.896 --> 01:34:17.820]  And then all this other stuff behind the scenes, I'm not at liberty to tell you about yet, but I will.
[01:34:18.761 --> 01:34:24.165]  Because they know our metrics, folks, despite the fact that they've tried to censor us and block info wars and news wars.
[01:34:25.066 --> 01:34:30.391]  Despite the fact they've tried to shut us down and try to get criminal investigations going on myself, Matt Drudge and others.
[01:34:30.871 --> 01:34:32.773]  Those have all been dropped because there's nothing there.
[01:34:32.793 --> 01:34:33.874]  No Russian collusion.
[01:34:34.214 --> 01:34:34.975]  No connections.
[01:34:35.395 --> 01:34:39.298]  Federal Elections Commission led by Democrats wanted us criminally indicted.
[01:34:39.639 --> 01:34:43.742]  That's all gone away because it's like trying to indict me for being the tooth fairy.
[01:34:44.323 --> 01:34:45.164]  It's just not true.
[01:34:45.464 --> 01:34:47.486]  But seriously, if you'll just commit
[01:34:48.106 --> 01:34:50.648]  To spread articles and videos in the war.
[01:34:50.748 --> 01:34:53.230]  It's exciting on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube.
[01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:57.373]  Hey, this man right here has just been banned off Twitter because he was having such an effect.
[01:34:57.693 --> 01:34:58.774]  They admit they've done it.
[01:35:00.115 --> 01:35:01.876]  But they can't ban all of you.
[01:35:02.176 --> 01:35:04.158]  And they can't stop you from making other accounts.
[01:35:04.338 --> 01:35:06.760]  It's an information war.
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:10.743]  They want to kick us off these big platforms that they act like are open to the public.
[01:35:11.443 --> 01:35:15.567]  But now they're on the hot seat, so please go to InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:36:05.121 --> 01:36:06.363]  Everything I do is about symbiosis.
[01:36:06.723 --> 01:36:07.264]  Symbiotic.
[01:36:07.364 --> 01:36:07.785]  Win-win.
[01:36:08.125 --> 01:36:09.186]  Non-zero-sum game.
[01:36:10.088 --> 01:36:11.309]  Everything I do is about a win-win.
[01:36:11.369 --> 01:36:13.913]  It's far beyond superstition.
[01:36:13.933 --> 01:36:15.175]  I'm obsessed with it, okay?
[01:36:16.196 --> 01:36:16.597]  And so...
[01:36:17.257 --> 01:36:20.460]  I'm not like somebody like Harvey Weinstein who likes to torture women while he rapes them.
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:22.922]  I mean, I like my wife to have as good a time as I'm having.
[01:36:22.942 --> 01:36:23.603]  That's my enjoyment.
[01:36:23.743 --> 01:36:24.784]  I'm not trying to get graphic here.
[01:36:24.964 --> 01:36:26.826]  The point is, is that that's how Trump is too.
[01:36:27.166 --> 01:36:28.267]  We want prosperity.
[01:36:28.327 --> 01:36:29.128]  We want to win.
[01:36:29.448 --> 01:36:31.490]  But to do that, you've got to energize us.
[01:36:31.810 --> 01:36:32.751]  We energize you.
[01:36:33.011 --> 01:36:35.033]  The enemy knows where the resistance is coming from.
[01:36:35.313 --> 01:36:37.095]  They know we're the winning globally.
[01:36:37.515 --> 01:36:39.676]  Infowars, this is the reboot of Americana.
[01:36:39.976 --> 01:36:41.497]  I didn't invent it, I just brought it back.
[01:36:41.877 --> 01:36:42.538]  You brought it back.
[01:36:42.958 --> 01:36:44.679]  All over the world, baby, Infowars.
[01:36:44.939 --> 01:36:46.700]  We're leading the populist revolution.
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:51.102]  America, 1776 worldwide, is happening.
[01:36:51.202 --> 01:36:52.462]  Something I've been saying for 10 years.
[01:36:52.863 --> 01:36:53.323]  It's here.
[01:36:53.783 --> 01:36:56.725]  We're winning in the military, law enforcement, the bureaucracy.
[01:36:57.005 --> 01:37:00.907]  We're taking the government back, and it's happening, and the economy's turning back on.
[01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:05.012]  Commit today to financially support us.
[01:37:05.272 --> 01:37:06.313]  Get products you need.
[01:37:06.393 --> 01:37:07.194]  It's Symbiotic.
[01:37:08.035 --> 01:37:09.716]  It's a win-win, 360 win.
[01:37:09.737 --> 01:37:13.120]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:15.362]  DNA Force is back.
[01:37:15.622 --> 01:37:16.903]  Okay, Roger, I'm ranting.
[01:37:17.344 --> 01:37:18.785]  I'm just so excited here.
[01:37:19.806 --> 01:37:20.306]  But again,
[01:37:21.007 --> 01:37:23.448]  You're saying I've been predicting this for six months.
[01:37:23.868 --> 01:37:36.035]  The SJWs, the antifa, the communist groups, have been saying, we're going to launch our revolution November 4th, and many of them say, we're going to kill cops, we're going to kill talk show hosts.
[01:37:37.115 --> 01:37:46.583]  My security folks want me talking about the things that go on, but the issue is they're saying hashtag kill Republicans on TV, Democratic strategists.
[01:37:46.603 --> 01:37:47.404]  They're celebrating.
[01:37:47.684 --> 01:37:48.545]  Scalise getting shot.
[01:37:48.585 --> 01:37:51.667]  Wolf Blitzer had a guest on saying this guy was basically a hero.
[01:37:51.908 --> 01:37:54.069]  He wasn't a bad guy shooting Scalise and the other people.
[01:37:54.490 --> 01:37:56.531]  I mean, they mean business, folks.
[01:37:56.852 --> 01:38:00.675]  They don't just attack me and Roger when we walk down the street in San Francisco or Austin.
[01:38:01.275 --> 01:38:03.057]  Okay, they mean business.
[01:38:03.098 --> 01:38:04.840]  They want to bully us back into submission.
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:11.648]  And then they say, in articles every day in the last two weeks, Jones is insane and claims there's some November 4th movement coming.
[01:38:12.088 --> 01:38:15.953]  Here it is, full page, front section, New York Times.
[01:38:16.173 --> 01:38:18.316]  That cost $100,000, boys and girls.
[01:38:18.596 --> 01:38:20.238]  Funded by George Soros at the bottom.
[01:38:20.939 --> 01:38:23.461]  Now, what does that sound like to you, Roger Stone?
[01:38:23.501 --> 01:38:34.588]  Well, it's not coincidental that Tom Steyer is up on CNN with these ubiquitous 30-second TV spots attacking the president.
[01:38:34.628 --> 01:38:35.849]  He's mentally unbalanced.
[01:38:36.249 --> 01:38:37.190]  He's insane.
[01:38:37.230 --> 01:38:41.433]  We can't have a man like this with his finger on the nuclear button.
[01:38:41.453 --> 01:38:42.834]  You see the newspaper ad?
[01:38:42.854 --> 01:38:46.556]  They say we're causing a chain reaction that will drive Trump from power.
[01:38:46.956 --> 01:38:48.918]  They say the detonation begins November 4th.
[01:38:49.778 --> 01:38:51.319]  Yeah, but these are connected events.
[01:38:51.379 --> 01:39:02.462]  In other words, as one who has extensive experience in political advertising, I can tell you the newspaper ads, the television ads, these are all meant for a symbiotic, a synergistic effect.
[01:39:02.482 --> 01:39:03.182]  A coordination!
[01:39:03.263 --> 01:39:04.683]  To whip up the crazies.
[01:39:04.763 --> 01:39:05.463]  A team reaction!
[01:39:05.543 --> 01:39:07.744]  Exactly, to whip up the radicals.
[01:39:08.364 --> 01:39:11.565]  And we're going to talk about this on The War Room this afternoon.
[01:39:11.685 --> 01:39:15.006]  I think the establishment has the Mueller strategy.
[01:39:15.046 --> 01:39:16.847]  They laid it out for us this week.
[01:39:17.467 --> 01:39:20.329]  And the indictments are building towards November 4th.
[01:39:20.409 --> 01:39:21.209]  Right, exactly.
[01:39:21.309 --> 01:39:31.074]  And then we're talking about their fallback plan, a 25th amendment plan to unhorse our president using that constitutional rubric.
[01:39:31.095 --> 01:39:38.719]  We're going to be shedding light on this all week here at InfoWars because we have incredible inside information.
[01:39:38.799 --> 01:39:45.923]  And that's why you're here for this week, because we knew the main enemy assault of their new offensive starts November 4th.
[01:39:46.903 --> 01:39:50.352]  Folks, they've even sent me letters saying surrender by November 4th.
[01:39:50.773 --> 01:39:53.200]  The lawyers are looking at me going public with this tomorrow.
[01:39:53.781 --> 01:39:55.626]  I'm going to show you this as soon as we get off air.
[01:39:56.425 --> 01:39:57.025]  Unbelievable.
[01:39:57.505 --> 01:39:58.066]  Unbelievable.
[01:39:58.146 --> 01:39:59.626]  No, look, I think they have a game plan.
[01:39:59.646 --> 01:40:03.347]  Guys, ask David to bring over that thing from Gore, please.
[01:40:03.908 --> 01:40:06.569]  We're going to lay this out for the InfoWarriors.
[01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:08.909]  Plan A is the Mueller takedown.
[01:40:08.969 --> 01:40:21.794]  If that doesn't work, Plan B is the 25th Amendment takedown, which I think is going to be in conjunction with this overall Soros-Steyer funded media campaign.
[01:40:21.814 --> 01:40:22.414]  Oh, they admit it!
[01:40:22.854 --> 01:40:32.121]  So, these are interlocking pieces of... By the way, Soros claims he spends $500 million a year on average in off-election years, sometimes $800 million in election year.
[01:40:32.521 --> 01:40:40.167]  What does it mean that he's put $18 billion in to this foundation and says he intends to spend it just the next few years overthrowing Russia and the U.S.?
[01:40:40.488 --> 01:40:42.269]  I mean, why is he walking around?
[01:40:42.849 --> 01:40:54.912]  Last night, I was with a very high-level Republican lobbyist with very, very close ties to the Bush family and to Jeb Bush specifically.
[01:40:54.932 --> 01:41:01.554]  He had just had lunch with Jeb, and Jeb told him confidently, Trump will be gone by December.
[01:41:02.474 --> 01:41:04.854]  Trump will be gone by December.
[01:41:05.234 --> 01:41:06.195]  What does that tell you?
[01:41:06.215 --> 01:41:08.115]  Oh my God, we should have started the whole show with that.
[01:41:08.175 --> 01:41:09.716]  In fact, take that clip right there.
[01:41:10.216 --> 01:41:10.916]  No, start over.
[01:41:11.937 --> 01:41:14.403]  Start over, and we're going to put that right in front of this interview.
[01:41:14.744 --> 01:41:15.686]  This is so incredible.
[01:41:16.027 --> 01:41:17.451]  Roger, folks, never bluffs.
[01:41:17.491 --> 01:41:18.353]  He's got the intel.
[01:41:19.355 --> 01:41:20.739]  So Jeb Bush is saying...
[01:41:22.292 --> 01:41:24.393]  Trump will be gone by December.
[01:41:24.953 --> 01:41:26.053]  What is he talking about?
[01:41:26.393 --> 01:41:27.714]  That's what he's talking about.
[01:41:27.814 --> 01:41:34.796]  These ads, these TV spots, in a synergistic effort with a 25th Amendment takedown of the President.
[01:41:35.576 --> 01:41:42.358]  Their claim is going to be, well, he's unbalanced, he's non-compos mentis, he can no longer do the job.
[01:41:42.838 --> 01:41:45.459]  This is the overall establishment plot.
[01:41:45.599 --> 01:41:48.540]  First, they try the Mueller assault.
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:49.680]  If that doesn't work,
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:42:00.570]  They try the 25th Amendment assault, backed by their street demonstrations, backed by the rowdies on the street demanding Donald Trump's removal.
[01:42:01.231 --> 01:42:11.101]  So the whole concerted next wave, their biggest push, comes this November 4th, and they are going to operate on every level, lawsuits, physical attacks.
[01:42:11.821 --> 01:42:14.842]  Uh, cop killing, uh, you know, out of the Soros funded groups.
[01:42:15.222 --> 01:42:21.804]  I mean, they think we're all, what's crazy is they think the threats make us roll over when all it does is energize us.
[01:42:22.644 --> 01:42:23.704]  Where's their blind spot?
[01:42:24.024 --> 01:42:24.865]  Well, it's interesting.
[01:42:24.985 --> 01:42:35.328]  I would have taken the Jeb report with a bit of a grain of salt, but having done the rounds in Washington yesterday, I also met with another Republican lobbyist.
[01:42:35.388 --> 01:42:36.848]  Hold on, stay there and recap it.
[01:42:37.168 --> 01:42:38.789]  When we come back, give us the new info.
[01:42:38.889 --> 01:42:39.969]  This is incredible.
[01:42:40.589 --> 01:42:41.851]  Roger, that's why I was saying to come in here.
[01:42:41.891 --> 01:42:44.153]  Hey, we haven't had time to talk first.
[01:42:44.454 --> 01:42:47.397]  Tell folks whatever the biggest news is, tell us up front.
[01:42:47.557 --> 01:42:48.999]  That's what we always do at InfoWars.
[01:42:49.359 --> 01:42:54.505]  We give you the news a year before anybody else does and everybody knows it.
[01:42:54.565 --> 01:42:55.286]  That's why they hate us.
[01:42:55.847 --> 01:42:58.690]  So get tomorrow's news today at InfoWars.com.
[01:42:58.710 --> 01:42:59.091]  Stay with us.
[01:43:02.208 --> 01:43:04.369]  Globalization has not been an unalloyed good.
[01:43:04.509 --> 01:43:05.569]  I am a free trader.
[01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:07.610]  I am a strong supporter of globalization.
[01:43:08.150 --> 01:43:13.012]  Globalization doesn't seem to be working for the middle class, for ordinary people.
[01:43:13.212 --> 01:43:16.853]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:43:17.293 --> 01:43:21.475]  The rise of nationalist movements all over the world has a counterbalance to
[01:43:22.695 --> 01:43:26.618]  Globalization, maybe it's most marked with the European Economic Community.
[01:43:27.019 --> 01:43:33.324]  To simultaneously erect a system where the top is so far from the bottom, that the bottom has no connection to the top.
[01:43:34.084 --> 01:43:43.211]  The old rules-based system is beginning to crumble, hastened by Brexit in Britain and in the European Union, and hastened by what President Trump is standing for.
[01:43:43.492 --> 01:43:47.815]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[01:43:48.155 --> 01:43:50.757]  The global governance is failing.
[01:43:51.718 --> 01:44:05.089]  The globalists had already thought they had full control of America, and then the world are in total panic mode in an existential battle, seeing their entire authoritarian world government crumble and collapse in front of them.
[01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:16.738]  And so George Soros funds Media Matters, CNN, MSNBC, all these legal groups that are openly suing Trump thousands of times, setting up and suing us as well.
[01:44:17.358 --> 01:44:29.712]  Trying to sabotage our suppliers, trying to shut down our support base, trying to get us kicked off radio and TV, trying to have us criminally investigated, trying to have us shut down.
[01:44:30.492 --> 01:44:35.878]  But I have the Republic behind me and common sense and an awake population to defend.
[01:44:36.599 --> 01:44:37.099]  Against you.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:45.564]  I'm not those poor, sad, hard-working Eastern European peasants that you helped round up for four years when you sent them to death camps, Soros.
[01:44:46.084 --> 01:44:48.345]  And you thought you could bring down America.
[01:44:48.606 --> 01:44:50.687]  You're gonna find out we're not gonna go so easy.
[01:44:51.267 --> 01:44:54.569]  So he's 18 billion dollars in to this fight right now.
[01:44:55.049 --> 01:45:02.457]  But here's the good news, Hillary had almost 3 billion dollars, Trump had about 400-500 million, but he had the people, and so he won.
[01:45:02.897 --> 01:45:10.285]  And so this force feeding of his culture war, and trying to buy off groups, isn't gonna help him, it's gonna blow up in his face.
[01:45:10.645 --> 01:45:13.708]  Because no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[01:45:14.309 --> 01:45:16.791]  So I'm asking listeners and viewers of this transmission,
[01:45:17.872 --> 01:45:43.902]  Now more than ever to understand, when you spread the articles, when you spread the videos, when you spread the live feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show, or Facebook, Google, Twitter, or other platforms, or you spread the podcasts, and when you buy the products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are involved in a revolutionary act against these globalists, because pennies against their thousands of dollars, and millions against their billions, is already defeating them and will defeat them.
[01:45:44.582 --> 01:45:51.864]  That he's gonna have to put in hundreds of times a year what he put in previously of his stolen loot just kills him!
[01:45:52.445 --> 01:46:00.407]  So I'm asking you, as the enemy ups their power against us, as the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[01:46:00.787 --> 01:46:04.669]  And InfoWars is imperfect, but we are seen by the enemy as the standard.
[01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:08.250]  As one of the main standard-bearer operations against them.
[01:46:08.530 --> 01:46:09.831]  And that's why we're under attack.
[01:46:10.052 --> 01:46:14.156]  So rally around the flag, my friends, and financially support us today.
[01:46:14.576 --> 01:46:15.037]  Commit.

[01:46:32.473 --> 01:46:36.676]  We've got to end it in a matter of days.

[01:46:52.285 --> 01:46:59.489]  That will make this operation continue strong in the face of the enemy and we will defeat the scum.
[01:47:05.778 --> 01:47:08.369]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:31.596 --> 01:47:35.078]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:47:35.638 --> 01:47:37.499]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:38.679 --> 01:47:43.762]  Roger Stone just landed an hour ago here in Austin from D.C.
[01:47:44.602 --> 01:47:50.165]  with high-level meetings with top advisors to the Bushes, the Clintons, you name it.
[01:47:50.925 --> 01:47:52.386]  And that's why they fear him.
[01:47:52.406 --> 01:47:54.147]  He's got the contacts, including the president.
[01:47:55.348 --> 01:48:00.575]  He has just laid out during this break to me really serious info that dovetails with their plan.
[01:48:00.996 --> 01:48:05.962]  George Soros has bought a full-page ad for Antifa calling for the overthrow of Trump beginning November 4th.
[01:48:06.203 --> 01:48:07.304]  They're all coordinating it.
[01:48:07.564 --> 01:48:11.089]  Roger Stone, please give people an intelligence report on what you just told me.
[01:48:11.994 --> 01:48:25.424]  Well, Alex, I was in Washington for the purpose of meeting with some of the most powerful and most knowledgeable telecommunications lawyers in the country in preparation for a lawsuit against Twitter.
[01:48:26.325 --> 01:48:34.671]  I heard only minutes ago that the official feed for the Netflix documentary Stone Flick
[01:48:35.511 --> 01:48:39.675]  Forget me, Roger Stone, has now also been suspended.
[01:48:40.275 --> 01:48:42.997]  So I will own Twitter before this is over.
[01:48:43.418 --> 01:48:48.041]  There are First Amendment issues, there are antitrust issues.
[01:48:48.081 --> 01:48:49.162]  Cautious interference.
[01:48:49.783 --> 01:48:59.771]  But during the time I was in Washington, I never lose the opportunity to socialize, and I had a cocktail with a very prodigious
[01:49:00.992 --> 01:49:10.378]  Bush fundraiser, somebody with close personal relationships to George W., to George H.W., and to Jeb.
[01:49:11.298 --> 01:49:16.862]  And he told me that he had seen Jeb recently when the topic of Trump came up.
[01:49:16.902 --> 01:49:17.963]  You said that day at lunch?
[01:49:18.003 --> 01:49:19.424]  Yeah, at a lunch.
[01:49:19.904 --> 01:49:25.248]  He said Jeb said confidently, Trump will be gone by December.
[01:49:25.828 --> 01:49:28.989]  Now, I would normally take that with a grain of salt.
[01:49:29.549 --> 01:49:39.832]  Later in the evening, I saw a very prominent Republican lobbyist who had just been with a major rhino Republican senator who shall remain nameless.
[01:49:40.632 --> 01:49:48.855]  And ironically, when the subject of Trump came up, he also said, don't worry about him, he'll be gone by December.
[01:49:49.435 --> 01:49:51.377]  Now I see these ads.
[01:49:51.717 --> 01:49:54.420]  I've seen the Tom Steyer TV ads.
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:57.403]  Steyer being kind of a junior Soros.
[01:49:57.463 --> 01:50:00.727]  By the way, he's lost every election he's ever touched.
[01:50:01.207 --> 01:50:06.512]  Now you bring this in, these full-page newspaper ads, and folks, this ain't cheap.
[01:50:07.153 --> 01:50:12.215]  The full page of the New York Times, that's 100K plus, depending on what editions it ran in.
[01:50:12.595 --> 01:50:15.555]  And I see the synergy of their political strategy.
[01:50:16.056 --> 01:50:20.137]  They are going to run a street revolution against Trump, a revolt.
[01:50:20.537 --> 01:50:22.398]  At the same time, that's the astroturf.
[01:50:22.458 --> 01:50:24.838]  It's the 25th Amendment strategy.
[01:50:24.918 --> 01:50:27.819]  So, plan A, the Mueller takedown.
[01:50:27.959 --> 01:50:33.681]  Not looking very good right now, because Mueller laid out his cards, and they are weak indeed.
[01:50:34.401 --> 01:50:38.684]  If they were counting on Manafort to roll over, clearly they were.
[01:50:39.124 --> 01:50:41.326]  They dumped these charges on him.
[01:50:42.146 --> 01:50:44.588]  I can report to the Info Warriors right now.
[01:50:44.968 --> 01:50:48.671]  Manafort will plead not guilty and he will fight to the death.
[01:50:49.131 --> 01:50:52.813]  He is not going to bear false witness against the President of the United States.
[01:50:53.194 --> 01:50:58.137]  He is not going to make up lies about Donald Trump and the Russians to please Bob Mueller.
[01:50:58.517 --> 01:51:02.280]  He is a fighter and he will go down fighting if he has to.
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:09.923]  But there is zero chance that they will break his spirit or break his commitment to making America great again and taking on the globalists.
[01:51:09.983 --> 01:51:13.465]  So I think the Mueller plan is going to fail.
[01:51:14.125 --> 01:51:25.970]  That moves us to the 25th Amendment plan, Alex, and this week here at InfoWars we're going to lay out who exactly the plotters are and what their scheme is to remove the president.
[01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:27.251]  They seek to do
[01:51:28.775 --> 01:51:35.283]  In the courts, and through the Constitution, in a bogus proceeding, what they could not do at the ballot box.
[01:51:36.405 --> 01:51:36.945]  Absolutely.
[01:51:37.025 --> 01:51:38.447]  This is their biggest assault yet.
[01:51:38.487 --> 01:51:41.711]  But let's remember, they failed trying to steal the nomination.
[01:51:42.112 --> 01:51:43.313]  They did steal it from Sanders.
[01:51:43.894 --> 01:51:51.620]  They failed to then keep him from getting the final nomination at the convention in Cleveland that you and I attended, and the rest of the crew.
[01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:57.104]  And then they failed to get the faithless electors to stop him from being seated at the Electoral College.
[01:51:57.385 --> 01:51:59.466]  They have failed, failed, failed, failed.
[01:51:59.806 --> 01:52:03.369]  And now Russiagate completely turns around, just as you said a year and a half ago.
[01:52:03.890 --> 01:52:08.914]  Everything they accused Trump of, and you and I of, how asinine, they have done!
[01:52:09.654 --> 01:52:22.513]  No, they've got the worst possible perfect storm between Uranium One and the revelations about Fusion GPS and the ties first revealed here at InfoWars to the Bush
[01:52:23.564 --> 01:52:29.726]  Rubio Republican money man Paul Singer and his henchman Dan Senor.
[01:52:30.466 --> 01:52:36.168]  And then pass that ball on to Hillary Clinton as the president noted today in a tweet.
[01:52:36.628 --> 01:52:45.251]  Up to 13 million dollars now spent on this bogus narrative accusing the president of sexual indiscretions.
[01:52:45.311 --> 01:52:46.291]  Completely false.
[01:52:46.391 --> 01:52:47.612]  Completely made up.
[01:52:48.232 --> 01:52:49.493]  They are in retreat.
[01:52:49.633 --> 01:52:53.514]  They see the pieces coming together for their indictment.
[01:52:54.554 --> 01:53:03.398]  Therefore, the guy we really have to count on, the guy who I think is a hero, who I've known for many years, and somebody of extraordinary integrity,
[01:53:04.318 --> 01:53:05.739]  Is Senator Chuck Grassley.
[01:53:06.139 --> 01:53:09.640]  He is going to bust Uranium One wide open.
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:17.723]  And in my view, it is essential to have both Mueller and Rosenstein in the hot seat, answering questions under oath.
[01:53:17.743 --> 01:53:23.285]  And that's why they're saying your plan is ridiculous, because they know the President listens on pardons, you name it.
[01:53:23.765 --> 01:53:25.866]  And you've been telling him all along what was going to happen.
[01:53:25.926 --> 01:53:27.146]  It's happened just as you said it would.
[01:53:27.166 --> 01:53:29.107]  I don't know how much I can say here.
[01:53:29.947 --> 01:53:31.448]  The President's got to know, you've been dead on.
[01:53:31.889 --> 01:53:40.215]  Well, I was heartened by the fact that General Kelly, in this terrific interview with Laura Ingraham, laid out the need for a special prosecutor.
[01:53:40.755 --> 01:53:42.617]  Is Kelly not suddenly getting a lot better?
[01:53:43.538 --> 01:53:45.079]  And notice the left's turned on him now.
[01:53:45.439 --> 01:53:47.040]  The left has turned on him.
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:52.684]  He clearly has figured out that the way to stay on his job is to go to the wall for Donald Trump.
[01:53:53.084 --> 01:54:08.875]  Donald Trump is a man who rewards and appreciates loyalty, and whether it is General Kelly taking on the whack job congresswoman from Florida with her cowboy hats, or whether it is him pointing out that we need a special prosecutor.
[01:54:09.376 --> 01:54:10.657]  Here's the linchpin though, Alex.
[01:54:11.337 --> 01:54:13.617]  What will Jeff Sessions do?
[01:54:14.118 --> 01:54:15.798]  He's the weak link.
[01:54:16.278 --> 01:54:17.158]  It appears that way.
[01:54:17.218 --> 01:54:20.599]  When the President orders him, this isn't a suggestion, Jeff.
[01:54:20.939 --> 01:54:23.079]  And the President's on TV saying, do something!
[01:54:23.119 --> 01:54:24.180]  They're in bed with the Russians!
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:24.920]  Exactly.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.321]  So it would not shock me if Jeff Sessions has to go.
[01:54:29.501 --> 01:54:34.642]  He's either got to follow orders and appoint a real special prosecutor, someone like
[01:54:35.182 --> 01:54:41.125]  Not like Mike McKasey, or someone like... Well, Craig Gowdy's already said he wouldn't do it.
[01:54:41.365 --> 01:54:44.346]  Andrew McCarthy, Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[01:54:44.366 --> 01:54:44.787]  He'd be great.
[01:54:44.967 --> 01:54:48.008]  Any of them are more than capable of doing this job.
[01:54:48.328 --> 01:54:51.350]  We need a real, fearless, honest prosecutor.
[01:54:51.370 --> 01:54:52.130]  Well, let's boil it down.
[01:54:52.170 --> 01:54:59.614]  We're in a mob war between a group that wants to restore the republic and not have us sell the country out, and a group that thinks they own the country.
[01:54:59.934 --> 01:55:01.895]  What about the wild card, though, of Trump saying,
[01:55:03.007 --> 01:55:06.389]  Don't bring people in on these cultural enrichment visas.
[01:55:06.429 --> 01:55:12.674]  That's actually what they're called, folks, that Chuck Schumer and Obama put through seven years ago.
[01:55:13.074 --> 01:55:27.804]  And then almost all the terror attacks we see are from the, quote, refugees or cultural enrichment from the very countries Trump is trying to block people unvetted where, folks, in Sudan or in Somalia, an imam gives you a passport
[01:55:28.504 --> 01:55:33.106]  Who lets you cross a border and then fly out on, say, a Kenyan Airways.
[01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:34.626]  They don't even have airports that work.
[01:55:35.447 --> 01:55:37.468]  Trump's saying he bans seven countries.
[01:55:37.828 --> 01:55:39.909]  These are countries that don't have running water!
[01:55:40.169 --> 01:55:42.049]  We have no idea who's getting on the damn planes.
[01:55:42.289 --> 01:55:43.270]  He better block them!
[01:55:43.710 --> 01:55:48.272]  I wonder if the people killed in Times Square feel culturally enriched today.
[01:55:49.139 --> 01:55:55.184]  I wonder if there's going to be a seven-day waiting period like we have with the old Brady Law on rental trucks.
[01:55:55.644 --> 01:55:57.525]  Because you know, if they'd had just a waiting period.
[01:55:57.545 --> 01:56:00.628]  Because you know, the New York Times says right here, the truck did it.
[01:56:00.648 --> 01:56:04.731]  Do you know that it's like Christine, the Stephen King movie, or Maximum Overdrive?
[01:56:05.011 --> 01:56:06.512]  You know, where the cars come along and kill you?
[01:56:06.832 --> 01:56:07.253]  Right here.
[01:56:07.713 --> 01:56:09.334]  Autobots transform and murder.
[01:56:09.775 --> 01:56:11.956]  Mile-long Manhattan truck attack kills eight.
[01:56:12.637 --> 01:56:13.838]  I knew it was Megatron.
[01:56:14.548 --> 01:56:16.130]  The truck had no driver, evidently.
[01:56:16.330 --> 01:56:17.070]  Extraordinary.
[01:56:17.271 --> 01:56:17.751]  Extraordinary.
[01:56:17.791 --> 01:56:20.634]  Did he not yell Ali Akbar just before the attack?
[01:56:21.634 --> 01:56:23.456]  I've seen that in several media reports.
[01:56:23.536 --> 01:56:26.459]  Why won't they call the truth the truth?
[01:56:26.519 --> 01:56:30.662]  Why won't they point out that this is Islamic terrorism at its worst?
[01:56:30.742 --> 01:56:32.164]  And again, listeners know this.
[01:56:32.384 --> 01:56:36.428]  I only generally plug once an hour over the years because that could fund us and we grew
[01:56:37.748 --> 01:56:39.969]  Symbiotically, organically, to the level we need it.
[01:56:40.049 --> 01:56:40.970]  Now's the main attack.
[01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.890]  Now's the war bonds.
[01:56:42.170 --> 01:56:43.991]  You spend money with Globalist, it's trading with the enemy.
[01:56:44.351 --> 01:56:50.073]  You buy products at Infowarsstore.com, it is an act of total resistance to the Globalist and Soros.
[01:56:50.413 --> 01:56:53.495]  And for his billions, millions can counter that.
[01:56:53.555 --> 01:56:54.435]  But we need millions.
[01:56:54.455 --> 01:57:02.098]  Because I sell high quality products at such low prices that I argue with some of my crew that are in marketing, I think super low prices are the way to go.
[01:57:02.118 --> 01:57:03.839]  And people just buy more and we make more.
[01:57:04.319 --> 01:57:06.161]  I'm right kinda, but sometimes not.
[01:57:06.181 --> 01:57:08.483]  Because sometimes things are best sellers, sometimes they're not.
[01:57:08.823 --> 01:57:14.508]  I need folks to go to Infowarsstore.com and get one of, you know, 60-70 t-shirts to spread the word, meat-like minded folks.
[01:57:14.768 --> 01:57:21.814]  I need you to sign up for auto-ship to get great products like DNA Force and great probiotics like Biome Defense and Brain Force Plus and a bunch of specials that end the day.
[01:57:22.314 --> 01:57:24.316]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:26.658 --> 01:57:32.263]  One of my biggest stressors is trying to raise money to hire more crew to battle harder and fending off enemy attacks.
[01:57:32.283 --> 01:57:38.889]  But if you flood us with cash, it absolutely takes weight off us to spend time in information warfare.
[01:57:39.209 --> 01:57:40.310]  So, I'm going to say it now.
[01:57:40.771 --> 01:57:41.471]  You want us to fight?
[01:57:41.832 --> 01:57:42.612]  Energize us.
[01:57:42.832 --> 01:57:46.035]  Flood me with greenbacks and I commit I'll go to the death.
[01:57:46.276 --> 01:57:47.196]  But I need the money.
[01:57:47.417 --> 01:57:48.457]  That's how I wage war.
[01:57:48.678 --> 01:57:49.739]  Flood us with money now!
[01:58:00.154 --> 01:58:07.181]  We're not going to stoop to the tactics of this authoritarian communist and fascist, funded by that dirtbag George Soros.
[01:58:07.442 --> 01:58:09.925]  The communists, they can't resist free stuff.
[01:58:10.465 --> 01:58:13.649]  Instead of a booth, it says free stuff.
[01:58:13.829 --> 01:58:20.176]  We're going to keep our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, and the American way, but at the same time, we're not going to back down from this
[01:58:28.490 --> 01:58:30.931]  What do I do if one of these libtards calls me a Nazi?
[01:58:31.631 --> 01:58:32.132]  That's easy.
[01:58:32.152 --> 01:58:36.754]  You just put a pacifier in his mouth.
[01:58:39.635 --> 01:58:42.196]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[01:58:42.656 --> 01:58:44.237]  One of these Antifa's get in my face.
[01:58:44.257 --> 01:58:49.780]  I'm gonna pull out my pocket constitution and stick it in his.
[01:58:53.141 --> 01:58:53.781]  Antifa?
[01:58:54.442 --> 01:58:55.082]  Never heard of him.
[01:58:56.730 --> 01:58:57.490]  Never heard of the guy.
[01:58:58.210 --> 01:59:03.432]  They're gonna lose on November 4th and every day after that because they're a bunch of meth-head pieces of crap.
[01:59:04.232 --> 01:59:09.373]  That's French for p***y. Holding our ground and not letting these bullies push us around.
[01:59:10.033 --> 01:59:11.413]  But, not stooping to their level.
[01:59:12.394 --> 01:59:13.734]  We're gonna grab them by the antifa.
[01:59:15.534 --> 01:59:17.555]  So on November 4th, we gotta do a thing.
[01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:19.731]  Yeah, we're gonna do it tonight.
[01:59:20.191 --> 01:59:23.112]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:59:23.492 --> 01:59:25.253]  We're winning that war thanks to you.
[01:59:25.774 --> 01:59:30.896]  And wearing t-shirts and InfoWars ball caps in public is one of the best ways to spread the word.
[01:59:31.216 --> 01:59:34.278]  The revolution starts now with you at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:35.038 --> 01:59:41.780]  Available right now, our limited edition anti-fascist and anti-communist t-shirt.
[01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:48.283]  Specifically designed to trigger the left this November and beyond.
[01:59:48.803 --> 01:59:51.744]  Order now, infowarestore.com.
[01:59:56.705 --> 02:00:00.627]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:12.563 --> 02:00:18.670]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure, you're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.750 --> 02:00:19.450]  By the way,
[02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:34.430]  Roger Stone, you heard it here first three days ago, is considering suing Twitter.
[02:00:34.450 --> 02:00:35.371]  He's talking to top lawyers.
[02:00:35.731 --> 02:00:37.531]  He has a cut-and-dried case of discrimination.
[02:00:37.912 --> 02:00:39.272]  They've operated like a utility.
[02:00:39.412 --> 02:00:40.633]  They told Congress they're a utility.
[02:00:40.653 --> 02:00:41.233]  So has Google.
[02:00:41.613 --> 02:00:42.213]  So has Facebook.
[02:00:43.233 --> 02:00:47.495]  But now we have Veritas video and internal documents across the board.
[02:00:48.915 --> 02:00:52.937]  Where if their employees say men exist, they're fired.
[02:00:54.019 --> 02:00:57.302]  I know that sounds crazy, but that's how cultic it is now.
[02:00:57.362 --> 02:00:58.743]  Like robots, we are the board.
[02:00:59.023 --> 02:01:00.585]  There are no men, there are no women.
[02:01:01.425 --> 02:01:03.667]  And so he's getting ready to file a big suit.
[02:01:04.147 --> 02:01:05.489]  Milo, others are probably going to join.
[02:01:06.621 --> 02:01:09.262]  I've been looking at it, but they always ban us and bring us back.
[02:01:09.322 --> 02:01:10.002]  I've talked to lawyers.
[02:01:10.342 --> 02:01:12.482]  We've got good cases, but not as good as yours.
[02:01:12.942 --> 02:01:20.844]  And this brings light, right as they bring in this new guy to head up the Federal Trade Commission, who's an antitrust Google buster.
[02:01:21.184 --> 02:01:29.966]  And then we have the big executives and people that I'm going to play later after you leave, testifying that there really was no Russia collusion.
[02:01:30.006 --> 02:01:31.566]  In fact, the Russia stuff was anti-Trump.
[02:01:32.369 --> 02:01:34.030]  Yeah, no, it's extraordinary.
[02:01:34.290 --> 02:01:37.212]  The double standard that we're experiencing on Twitter.
[02:01:37.292 --> 02:01:46.077]  Look, every single day on Twitter, people threaten to kill me, kill my wife, kill my children, kill my dogs.
[02:01:46.797 --> 02:01:47.738]  Nothing happens to them.
[02:01:47.758 --> 02:01:48.478]  They're still there.
[02:01:48.939 --> 02:01:53.221]  Keith Olbermann threatens to burn people's houses down with them in them.
[02:01:53.281 --> 02:01:56.763]  He drops the F-bomb constantly and attacks on the president.
[02:01:57.223 --> 02:01:57.764]  The man is
[02:01:58.843 --> 02:02:03.388]  Not there, but still he is verified and on Twitter.
[02:02:04.549 --> 02:02:10.315]  Today, an Antifa spokesman announces the future beheading of a number of Americans.
[02:02:10.816 --> 02:02:13.659]  Still, their Twitter feed remains intact.
[02:02:14.099 --> 02:02:19.425]  So, it's about time, and I have met with a number of lawyers.
[02:02:19.445 --> 02:02:20.226]  This is very simple.
[02:02:20.846 --> 02:02:24.149]  Twitter needs to be regulated like a utility.
[02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:28.433]  The phone company's a private company, but they can't deny you a telephone.
[02:02:28.773 --> 02:02:31.175]  This is a First Amendment issue.
[02:02:31.656 --> 02:02:34.458]  And to say, oh, you used obscenity, really?
[02:02:34.518 --> 02:02:38.322]  Well, you better look at Keith Olbermann's feed, if that's the measure.
[02:02:39.283 --> 02:02:42.866]  I didn't say anything on Twitter that hasn't been said.
[02:02:42.926 --> 02:02:45.028]  You said Don Lemon is a complete idiot.
[02:02:45.168 --> 02:02:46.828]  Well, I said he's a snowflake.
[02:02:46.868 --> 02:02:48.049]  He's an imbecile.
[02:02:48.249 --> 02:02:51.350]  In his view, again... And they proved he's a snowflake!
[02:02:51.370 --> 02:02:52.130]  You got banned!
[02:02:53.070 --> 02:02:59.591]  The claim by Don Lemon is that the Clintons have been completely exonerated on Uranium One.
[02:03:00.052 --> 02:03:01.452]  No, Don, they haven't!
[02:03:01.732 --> 02:03:02.852]  Stop saying that!
[02:03:03.092 --> 02:03:03.773]  It's a lie!
[02:03:03.893 --> 02:03:06.953]  And when you repeat a lie, it makes you a liar!
[02:03:07.333 --> 02:03:09.614]  Go to your next party and knock it off, will you?
[02:03:11.085 --> 02:03:21.031]  In a separate issue, they're going to go take a break and get ready to host the war room coming up and the fourth hour here today that I'll join you in with what do you make of Podesta?
[02:03:21.071 --> 02:03:22.332]  He hardly ever tweets when he does.
[02:03:23.576 --> 02:03:29.339]  Foaming at the mouth at you, foaming at the mouth at me, making threats, saying I'm gonna eat, you know, eat crap.
[02:03:29.459 --> 02:03:30.500]  I mean, what is going on with him?
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:32.921]  I think he's becoming unhinged.
[02:03:32.941 --> 02:03:40.244]  You notice his brother was forced to step down from their extremely lucrative influence peddling operation in Washington, D.C.
[02:03:41.085 --> 02:03:45.447]  They try to divert attention to Pizzagate, but Pizzagate's not the issue.
[02:03:45.807 --> 02:03:47.268]  It's the art on the walls.
[02:03:47.348 --> 02:03:49.809]  It's the weird stuff written on your knuckles, John.
[02:03:50.109 --> 02:03:50.870]  We're on to you.
[02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:53.031]  We know what you are and what you do.
[02:03:53.311 --> 02:03:57.777]  Exactly, and I'm saying Podesta should be investigated from what's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:03:58.905 --> 02:04:06.268]  The New York Times, everybody, diverted it to a pizza place, we covered it, we took the bait, but we got the documents, and we got the P.I.s on the ground for six months.
[02:04:06.288 --> 02:04:06.908]  We're not stupid.
[02:04:07.928 --> 02:04:12.390]  So, look, I think he's becoming unhinged because they are getting exposed.
[02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:18.232]  Their whole carefully constructed Russian narrative is falling apart before their very eyes.
[02:04:18.852 --> 02:04:25.515]  The exact thing that they were seeking to divert from, the fact that they are the ones in bed with the... You know Podesta's watching right now.
[02:04:25.535 --> 02:04:26.235]  I hope so.
[02:04:26.675 --> 02:04:27.976]  Listen, he only talks about us?
[02:04:28.416 --> 02:04:33.302]  Yeah, well, don't try to get your feed followers up just by saying my name.
[02:04:33.662 --> 02:04:34.283]  It's ironic.
[02:04:34.403 --> 02:04:37.727]  Twitter killed me just when I hit 300,000 followers.
[02:04:37.747 --> 02:04:39.029]  And again, they do that to suppress.
[02:04:39.049 --> 02:04:42.993]  It turned out like 80-some percent of Obama's, Hillary's, it's all fake.
[02:04:43.053 --> 02:04:44.235]  We don't go buy followers.
[02:04:44.315 --> 02:04:46.498]  I could go buy 10 million tomorrow for like $50,000.
[02:04:47.859 --> 02:04:49.040]  Yeah, all of mine are real.
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:50.081]  It's fake, it's fake.
[02:04:50.161 --> 02:04:55.387]  No, Drudge is the number one site in the world and he only has like a million followers on Twitter.
[02:04:55.407 --> 02:04:56.908]  Because he doesn't have fake followers.
[02:04:56.948 --> 02:04:58.870]  Roger Stone, great job my friend.
[02:04:59.211 --> 02:05:02.374]  We got Matt Bracken, Mike Cernovich and more coming up on the Islamic terror attack.
[02:05:03.899 --> 02:05:05.301]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:05:05.341 --> 02:05:06.402]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:05:06.662 --> 02:05:07.583]  Why is this so good?
[02:05:07.883 --> 02:05:13.127]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:05:13.207 --> 02:05:26.758]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:05:26.818 --> 02:05:28.200]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:30.562]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:05:30.622 --> 02:05:33.104]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:05:33.204 --> 02:05:34.465]  These are all parasites.
[02:05:34.505 --> 02:05:35.606]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:05:35.626 --> 02:05:36.687]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:05:36.968 --> 02:05:41.292]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:05:41.512 --> 02:05:44.695]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:05:44.735 --> 02:05:47.837]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:05:47.857 --> 02:05:48.858]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:05:48.918 --> 02:05:50.799]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:50.859 --> 02:05:51.899]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:05:52.180 --> 02:05:53.981]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:05:54.601 --> 02:05:57.623]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:57.903 --> 02:05:59.784]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:06:00.165 --> 02:06:02.126]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:06:23.365 --> 02:06:28.029]  Burning inside... with the fires of liberty!
[02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:30.571]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:06:30.651 --> 02:06:31.231]  Yeah!
[02:06:31.332 --> 02:06:34.094]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:58.368 --> 02:07:02.291]  Mike Cernovich is coming up in just four or five minutes.
[02:07:03.071 --> 02:07:07.895]  Matt Bracken is only popping in briefly, but I want to get him back on the War Room and back on our show tomorrow.
[02:07:07.915 --> 02:07:09.796]  He's having some Skype trouble in the last 30 minutes.
[02:07:09.816 --> 02:07:25.567]  We're just getting a pop-in from Matt Bracken, a counterterrorism expert, best-selling author, former Navy SEAL, really smart guy, predicting six months ago that there'd be a big Antifa uprising, trying to overthrow Trump, that they would get very, very violent.
[02:07:26.442 --> 02:07:41.531]  They're simultaneously saying none of this exists while they're calling for it, but here is the full page New York Times ad calling for the total launch of a revolution on November 4th this Saturday and that they're going to quote drive the president from power.
[02:07:41.851 --> 02:07:50.957]  We just had Roger Stone on who met with one of the chief advisors to the Bush family and others saying Trump's gone by December.
[02:07:52.093 --> 02:07:54.275]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're making their move.
[02:07:54.316 --> 02:07:57.860]  It's a confidence game, though, because they said two months ago he'd be gone in two months.
[02:07:57.900 --> 02:07:59.642]  So their plan's behind schedule.
[02:07:59.882 --> 02:08:00.923]  His ratings are going up.
[02:08:01.183 --> 02:08:02.385]  He's delivering on the economy.
[02:08:02.565 --> 02:08:04.427]  But just a brief snapshot, Matt Bracken.
[02:08:05.188 --> 02:08:06.569]  We've seen the situation.
[02:08:07.742 --> 02:08:19.690]  While they had the Saudi Arabian military doing a conference and other things in Vegas, and more and more that's emerging as a deep state operation, very sophisticated, connected to different groups.
[02:08:20.631 --> 02:08:25.454]  And then we also at the same time have this latest Islamic attack yesterday, killing eight people.
[02:08:25.554 --> 02:08:27.136]  The New York Times calls it a truck attack.
[02:08:27.716 --> 02:08:29.257]  In five minutes, what's on your radar?
[02:08:29.277 --> 02:08:29.998]  What do you see happening?
[02:08:31.659 --> 02:08:35.641]  Just for a short thing, something that I haven't really heard a lot about in terms
[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:45.186]  The attack yesterday, they never mentioned Islam, Jihad or Allah Akbar at the conference this morning or yesterday.
[02:08:45.247 --> 02:08:45.867]  It's the them.
[02:08:45.907 --> 02:08:46.748]  It's like Martians.
[02:08:47.108 --> 02:08:49.490]  We're not going to surrender to the them or the they.
[02:08:49.930 --> 02:08:51.812]  But they're so cowardly they won't even say it.
[02:08:51.832 --> 02:08:55.755]  Imagine trying to fight World War II where you can't say German or Nazi.
[02:08:55.795 --> 02:08:58.237]  You can only say belligerent Europeans.
[02:08:58.911 --> 02:08:59.992]  You know, it's crazy.
[02:09:00.372 --> 02:09:05.154]  But the actual translation of Allah Akbar is not God is great.
[02:09:05.214 --> 02:09:06.135]  That's a big mistake.
[02:09:07.075 --> 02:09:11.438]  When they say Allahu and they put the U on the end of Allah, that means greater.
[02:09:11.818 --> 02:09:14.760]  So it means Allah is greater than your God.
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:17.281]  Allahu Akbar is our God is greater than your God.
[02:09:17.301 --> 02:09:22.664]  That's right, they're saying our God dominates you, we are defeating you, we are greater than you, we have conquered you.
[02:09:23.382 --> 02:09:23.962]  That's right.
[02:09:24.263 --> 02:09:31.927]  And watching Geraldo and these other apologists, they seem to be saying that the solution is putting up bollards all over the place.
[02:09:32.007 --> 02:09:34.449]  Anywhere a truck can go, we're going to put up bollards.
[02:09:34.529 --> 02:09:43.274]  But I think we should call those things Allahu-Ak bollards or Allahu-Ak barriers, because that's what they are.
[02:09:43.314 --> 02:09:45.236]  In Europe, they call them Koran blocks.
[02:09:45.776 --> 02:09:50.539]  They put up Jersey barricades and they put up these cement bollards.
[02:09:51.263 --> 02:09:53.043]  They never had to do that in any other war.
[02:09:53.083 --> 02:09:55.004]  It's because today the war is among us.
[02:09:55.544 --> 02:10:01.646]  And you know, as mad as I am at this terrorist, his name is literally Sword of Allah.
[02:10:02.226 --> 02:10:19.650]  You know, nobody of our extreme vetting picked up on the fact that his parents named this boy Sword of Allah and he won the ISIS lottery to come to America and bring 28 more, I just heard today, bring 28 of his closest inbred family here.
[02:10:20.253 --> 02:10:23.895]  Which I'm sure they're all on welfare, plotting more jihad attacks.
[02:10:23.915 --> 02:10:29.559]  We pay for them everything and then they hate us because we're creative and we're not inbred.
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:44.129]  And as angry as I am at these crazy jihadists, if a crazy farmer puts a fox in his chicken house and the next morning all the chickens are dead, the fox is just acting according to his nature.
[02:10:45.034 --> 02:10:47.175]  You know, the farmer is the one that's responsible.
[02:10:47.595 --> 02:10:53.237]  So it's Chuck Schumer and these people that thought it's a great idea to flood the country with, you know, tomorrow's jihadists.
[02:10:53.757 --> 02:10:56.578]  They're like the crazy farmer that put the fox in the chicken house.
[02:10:57.099 --> 02:11:03.161]  The fox and the sword of Islam, the sword of Allah, he's just going by his own nature, his true nature.
[02:11:04.561 --> 02:11:08.363]  Liberals believe that there's what they call the magic dirt theory.
[02:11:08.923 --> 02:11:10.424]  You take a guy who's raised for 22 years,
[02:11:11.784 --> 02:11:24.061]  To be a devout Islamic jihadist, hate women, hate gays, hate freedom, bring him to America and he's going to turn into a Jeffersonian constitutional Republican.
[02:11:24.682 --> 02:11:25.463]  It's insanity.
[02:11:26.227 --> 02:11:33.151]  And the main people that we need to point the finger at, and I'm very glad that our president is doing it, are these creeps like Chuck Schumer.
[02:11:33.652 --> 02:11:36.053]  They're the fox that is putting the chicken in the henhouse.
[02:11:36.073 --> 02:11:36.353]  That's right.
[02:11:36.373 --> 02:11:43.638]  He headed up the program, and we've shown the video of this guy after he's run over a bunch of people and jumped out of the car with his fake gun before the cops get him.
[02:11:44.518 --> 02:11:47.399]  He just literally looks like a rabid dog.
[02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:52.682]  You can tell when a dog's got rabies or is mentally ill, kind of stumbles around and acts weird.
[02:11:52.942 --> 02:11:56.703]  I mean, he just looks like an inbred mental patient.
[02:11:57.304 --> 02:12:01.826]  And why would they bring all these inbred mental patients in to run around and kill us?
[02:12:01.886 --> 02:12:03.186]  I mean, I'm so sick of it.
[02:12:03.526 --> 02:12:06.168]  And then to watch CNN and the New York Times try to cover it up.
[02:12:06.188 --> 02:12:10.550]  I mean, did you see Jake Tapper call Allah Akbar and say, oh, it's so beautiful?
[02:12:11.590 --> 02:12:13.671]  Yeah, and unfortunately, that's
[02:12:14.392 --> 02:12:14.832]  We're good.
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:36.723]  You know, it is the Ten Commandments are all kill, kill, kill.
[02:12:37.703 --> 02:12:38.924]  There's no way to take it out.
[02:12:38.944 --> 02:12:44.148]  And so he thinks he's doing something good, and then Jake Dapper goes, it is so beautiful.
[02:12:44.448 --> 02:12:51.633]  That's all a direct code to them saying, just like we supported the Arab Spring at CNN, we support you, brother.
[02:12:51.753 --> 02:12:52.434]  Good job.
[02:12:52.754 --> 02:12:55.016]  Just make sure it's a church next time.
[02:12:55.776 --> 02:13:02.061]  Yeah, the so-called moderate Muslims actually think that this guy is an idiot for blowing their cover.
[02:13:02.888 --> 02:13:05.750]  The smart ones think, look, we're going to win demographically.
[02:13:06.131 --> 02:13:09.953]  We're going to win just in the war of the womb, outbreeding you five to one.
[02:13:09.993 --> 02:13:11.655]  So, brother, you're blowing our cover.
[02:13:12.195 --> 02:13:18.680]  You know, we know you're eager to get your 72 virgins, but you're making us look bad and exposing the true aim.
[02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:22.122]  And the way he runs around in circles, he looks like a cockroach.
[02:13:23.043 --> 02:13:27.086]  Yeah, he didn't have the guts to actually pull a knife out and charge anybody, though.
[02:13:27.186 --> 02:13:28.907]  He just ran around with his toy guns.
[02:13:29.540 --> 02:13:30.921]  Trying for a suicide by cop.
[02:13:31.341 --> 02:13:40.867]  I'm very glad he got shot in the gluteus maximus, so he's available to interview, because he's going to be the poster boy for Islamism.
[02:13:41.367 --> 02:13:45.669]  I hope that they give him a microphone and a show, because he is the rabid dog of Islam.
[02:13:46.250 --> 02:13:52.894]  Well, Matthew, Matt, I want to get you back up on the war room today if you can, because I want to get your predictions for November 4th, what's coming, if not tomorrow.
[02:13:53.234 --> 02:13:54.274]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[02:13:54.715 --> 02:13:54.975]  Thanks.
[02:13:55.655 --> 02:13:58.457]  Alright, everything got backed up today because of skype problems for 30 minutes.
[02:13:58.778 --> 02:14:03.722]  I apologize to Mike Cerny for getting him on late, but we'll hold him a little bit in the next segment at the bottom of the hour.
[02:14:04.102 --> 02:14:08.586]  Then we have Steven Gern, a highly decorated Marine, and then...
[02:14:09.727 --> 02:14:14.951]  Contractor for the company, as it's known, who's been speaking about the whole Islamic invasion that's coming.
[02:14:15.571 --> 02:14:19.154]  I want to get to that briefly with Mike Cernovich and then into November 4th.
[02:14:19.174 --> 02:14:22.957]  Because they say, again, we're going to kill you and attack and overthrow November 4th.
[02:14:23.177 --> 02:14:27.400]  Then they say, oh, it's insane when Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones and others report on it.
[02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:29.081]  Nothing's coming November 4th.
[02:14:29.422 --> 02:14:37.167]  Mike Cernovich, what is the point of them saying nothing's coming November 4th, but then full page ads saying we're going to overthrow Trump on November 4th?
[02:14:37.207 --> 02:14:37.908]  What is going on here?
[02:14:39.145 --> 02:14:59.264]  I mean they're so weird and unhinged and as we learned from when Antifa was carrying a pedophile sign and then they go oh well we didn't even mean to carry it someone just handed it to us like wait so somebody hands you a pedophile sign you're just gonna carry around whatever anybody hands you they're not thinking Alex that's the whole point.
[02:14:59.464 --> 02:15:04.689]  And they're now trying to say that you planted it with no proof do we know who do we know where the sign came from?
[02:15:05.632 --> 02:15:07.713]  Yeah, there's zero proof of any of this.
[02:15:07.773 --> 02:15:10.675]  The media is saying it's a false flag, and I go, OK, where's your proof?
[02:15:11.335 --> 02:15:13.717]  And they go, well, Antifa wouldn't carry it.
[02:15:13.737 --> 02:15:14.938]  And I go, well, they did carry it.
[02:15:15.438 --> 02:15:17.139]  And then they go, well, somebody gave it to them.
[02:15:17.499 --> 02:15:18.540]  Well, OK, who?
[02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:19.120]  Who?
[02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:20.241]  No proof at all.
[02:15:20.301 --> 02:15:24.003]  But like you said yesterday, now they're having to admit false flags could exist.
[02:15:25.184 --> 02:15:27.505]  Right, which is a fantastic narrative win.
[02:15:28.006 --> 02:15:32.608]  So from my perspective, I don't care if it was some people maybe from 4chan or something who pranked him.
[02:15:32.668 --> 02:15:34.930]  I don't care, because we win either way.
[02:15:36.249 --> 02:15:42.194]  Yeah, because no one ever stages anything, even though the new CIA documents came out and admitted they were staging terror then.
[02:15:42.214 --> 02:15:43.495]  Mike Cernovich is our guest.
[02:15:43.515 --> 02:15:47.899]  We're going to come back and get his take on November 4th, what Antifa is planning to launch.
[02:15:47.919 --> 02:15:50.802]  You can see the whole coordination with the Republicans as well.
[02:15:51.202 --> 02:15:54.545]  The Republican leadership is saying Trump is gone in December.
[02:15:55.146 --> 02:15:57.588]  Now, I think that's wishful thinking, but they're going to do their darndest.
[02:15:57.888 --> 02:15:58.789]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:59.069 --> 02:15:59.950]  He's at Cernovich.
[02:16:00.070 --> 02:16:01.091]  I'm at Real Alex Jones.
[02:16:03.385 --> 02:16:13.195]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[02:16:14.035 --> 02:16:23.424]  And today we see the leftist, the globalist, controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[02:16:23.805 --> 02:16:26.768]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[02:16:27.368 --> 02:16:37.063]  Clothing is a statement, and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud, just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[02:16:37.524 --> 02:16:42.732]  So right now, folks, we're going to debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the Infowars store.
[02:16:43.773 --> 02:16:45.495]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[02:16:45.575 --> 02:16:46.496]  It's a limited edition.
[02:16:47.056 --> 02:16:49.058]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[02:16:49.279 --> 02:16:56.025]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[02:16:56.365 --> 02:17:00.549]  On the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[02:17:00.789 --> 02:17:02.291]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows
[02:17:02.811 --> 02:17:03.231]  We're good to go.
[02:17:24.339 --> 02:17:24.940]  Says it all.
[02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:25.920]  Need I say more?
[02:17:26.421 --> 02:17:28.042]  You want to have a political message out there?
[02:17:28.062 --> 02:17:33.846]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[02:17:34.167 --> 02:17:37.249]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[02:17:37.709 --> 02:17:43.294]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[02:17:44.014 --> 02:17:46.338]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[02:17:46.658 --> 02:17:55.051]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[02:17:55.311 --> 02:17:58.896]  And this shirt, The Spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[02:17:59.697 --> 02:18:09.188]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Labe or Come and Take It in good old-fashioned English t-shirts.
[02:18:09.328 --> 02:18:11.811]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[02:18:12.192 --> 02:18:13.293]  InfoWars.com.
[02:18:13.313 --> 02:18:13.813]  Spread the word.
[02:18:14.554 --> 02:18:15.655]  I designed this baby.
[02:18:15.735 --> 02:18:18.157]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[02:18:18.538 --> 02:18:22.802]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[02:18:23.202 --> 02:18:27.006]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[02:18:27.446 --> 02:18:30.148]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[02:18:30.168 --> 02:18:31.570]  It's been around about 19 years.
[02:18:32.190 --> 02:18:35.774]  It's the classic InfoWars tyranny response team shirt.
[02:18:36.054 --> 02:18:39.157]  And of course we've seen the NFL taking a knee.
[02:18:40.057 --> 02:18:43.659]  Uh, during the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[02:18:44.379 --> 02:18:45.260]  That's disrespectful.
[02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:49.281]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[02:18:49.361 --> 02:18:56.785]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[02:18:57.205 --> 02:18:58.665]  Our republic is in distress.
[02:18:59.126 --> 02:18:59.606]  Ask me why.
[02:19:00.266 --> 02:19:02.189]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[02:19:02.329 --> 02:19:07.876]  Good old camouflage with the Dayglo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[02:19:08.316 --> 02:19:09.798]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[02:19:09.878 --> 02:19:12.862]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go out and put another shirt on.
[02:19:13.322 --> 02:19:15.445]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[02:19:16.086 --> 02:19:18.349]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[02:19:19.029 --> 02:19:19.810]  It's all about freedom.
[02:19:19.850 --> 02:19:21.192]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[02:19:21.733 --> 02:19:22.634]  Resist Tyranny.
[02:19:23.295 --> 02:19:24.276]  Made in America.
[02:19:24.296 --> 02:19:24.276]  1776.
[02:19:24.917 --> 02:19:28.001]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[02:19:28.221 --> 02:19:29.202]  The backs are really cool.
[02:19:29.543 --> 02:19:30.203]  Look at that back.
[02:19:30.284 --> 02:19:31.165]  That is pure Americana.
[02:19:32.406 --> 02:19:37.569]  And I almost forgot, we've got dozens and dozens of great limited edition ball caps available.
[02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:38.350]  The Dayglo.
[02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:42.952]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[02:19:43.112 --> 02:19:44.733]  This is my favorite ball cap.
[02:19:45.113 --> 02:19:46.434]  Over 20 ball caps we've put out.
[02:19:46.654 --> 02:19:47.695]  It's got the nice patch.
[02:19:48.055 --> 02:19:49.096]  Infowars.com.
[02:19:49.336 --> 02:19:50.196]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[02:19:50.477 --> 02:19:53.899]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[02:19:54.319 --> 02:19:55.900]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:20:00.643]  Thank you all for your support and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:20:05.186 --> 02:20:07.772]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:34.531 --> 02:20:47.699]  Ladies and gentlemen, during the break I walked back into the break room to get a cup of coffee and Chuckie Schumer was on Fox News live in the Senate blaming Trump for New York.
[02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:55.403]  This is the guy, this is the guy that got the bill passed with Obama.
[02:20:55.443 --> 02:20:56.123]  He sponsored it.
[02:20:56.163 --> 02:20:56.724]  He rewrote it.
[02:20:57.560 --> 02:21:04.242]  He's the chief sponsor of the Diversity Lottery, the Cultural Enrichment as the EU calls it.
[02:21:04.702 --> 02:21:06.263]  We didn't make up these sick jokes.
[02:21:06.723 --> 02:21:11.685]  We call it Cultural Enrichment when they kill, you know, 89 people in Nice and injured 280 or whatever.
[02:21:12.785 --> 02:21:16.446]  Or all the other stuff, and scream Allah Akbar, you know, run your toddler over as they run.
[02:21:20.359 --> 02:21:21.679]  A Chuck Schumer beauty.
[02:21:21.739 --> 02:21:24.340]  Trump calls for the end of diversity visa program.
[02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:26.741]  And then this is Schumer's response.
[02:21:26.761 --> 02:21:27.881]  We're going back to Mike Cernovich.
[02:21:28.181 --> 02:21:28.621]  Here it is.
[02:21:29.702 --> 02:21:40.545]  President Bush, in a moment of national tragedy, understood the meaning of his high office and sought to bring our country together.
[02:21:41.787 --> 02:21:44.890]  President Trump, where is your leadership?
[02:21:45.330 --> 02:21:52.978]  I'm calling on the president to rescind his proposed cuts to this vital anti-terrorism funding immediately.
[02:21:53.778 --> 02:22:01.846]  So just last week that... And then there was more I saw where he's blaming Trump when they're trying to hold up budgets.
[02:22:01.886 --> 02:22:03.387]  I mean this is just total deception.
[02:22:03.428 --> 02:22:04.749]  What do you make of this, Mike Cernovich?
[02:22:06.403 --> 02:22:10.324]  Yeah, Trump, though, is doing deals with Schumer, right?
[02:22:10.344 --> 02:22:20.806]  That's what cracks me up, is the people who are meanest to Trump are the people who seem to get his attention, but then when you and I ever criticize Trump, they go, oh, you know, Jones and Cernovich are betraying us.
[02:22:20.826 --> 02:22:29.367]  Like, no, that's how Schumer, you have to, to get anything with Trump, you have to negotiate, and that's what Schumer is doing, and that's who Trump actually listens to and does deals to.
[02:22:29.747 --> 02:22:31.668]  So that's interesting that Schumer is doing that.
[02:22:31.688 --> 02:22:32.268]  I found out!
[02:22:34.338 --> 02:22:35.219]  Yeah, you have to push back.
[02:22:35.259 --> 02:22:39.261]  I did a video where I said, there's all this violence against Trump supporters.
[02:22:39.281 --> 02:22:40.922]  He won't call it out.
[02:22:41.243 --> 02:22:44.145]  Therefore, Trump is okay with Antifa violence against Trump supporters.
[02:23:02.413 --> 02:23:08.057]  A day or two later at that rally in Arizona, Trump finally, for the first time, called out Antifa.
[02:23:08.637 --> 02:23:12.359]  So people go, oh, you know, Sir Rich Jones, you guys are on and off the Trump train.
[02:23:12.940 --> 02:23:15.522]  No, let the professionals do our jobs.
[02:23:15.662 --> 02:23:16.502]  We know what we're doing.
[02:23:16.802 --> 02:23:20.024]  We're reminding Trump that, hey, this is an ongoing negotiation.
[02:23:20.445 --> 02:23:21.966]  You're just not going to steamroll us.
[02:23:22.526 --> 02:23:25.448]  And we see again, Chuck Schumer gets great deals out of Trump.
[02:23:25.988 --> 02:23:29.772]  Because Trump does not respond well to weak people and to weakness.
[02:23:29.812 --> 02:23:33.575]  He only responds well to people who negotiate back very aggressively.
[02:23:33.796 --> 02:23:34.216]  Exactly.
[02:23:34.236 --> 02:23:39.901]  Instead of me just addressing the conversation, you've always got big stuff in the frying pan and also stuff on the back burner.
[02:23:40.302 --> 02:23:42.364]  What's other big news in planet Cernovich?
[02:23:43.445 --> 02:23:49.971]  Well, Vanity Fair has come out with stories that Roger Stone, of course, has broken, you have broken, I've broken, where Trump
[02:23:51.047 --> 02:23:53.307]  Realizes what a disaster Jared Kushner is.
[02:23:54.148 --> 02:23:59.809]  Big write-up in Vanity Fair about the bad advice from Kushner to fire General Flynn.
[02:23:59.849 --> 02:24:01.809]  That was the biggest mistake of Trump's presidency.
[02:24:02.589 --> 02:24:05.109]  Firing James Comey, that was a Kushner idea too.
[02:24:05.229 --> 02:24:13.911]  So the White House coup is at a... How do you want to... It's been paused because General Kelly is now tagged into the culture war.
[02:24:14.471 --> 02:24:19.632]  So General Kelly has said privately to Trump, I know people who are familiar with the conversation,
[02:24:20.558 --> 02:24:27.657]  That now I understand why you're always hitting back because once it went after General Kelly when he was very, very classy, very distinguished Gold Star father.
[02:24:28.419 --> 02:24:31.580]  He said, oh wait, so this is what it's like to be attacked over nothing.
[02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:34.141]  They're fabricating things, they're lying about me.
[02:24:34.681 --> 02:24:40.224]  So Kelly said, I understand Trump, your tweets and I, you know... That was my next question, man, you're always on target.
[02:24:40.624 --> 02:24:47.406]  Kelly really is gotten better now after they attacked him and his family, and now the left totally turned on him.
[02:24:48.267 --> 02:24:50.768]  So that's good to know, now Kelly understands.
[02:24:52.108 --> 02:24:52.669]  Exactly!
[02:24:52.969 --> 02:24:56.210]  So that is again, Trump's Twitter has been much more effective now.
[02:24:57.085 --> 02:25:00.809]  The rhetoric isn't quite as fiery or hot, but he's tweeting more often now.
[02:25:00.849 --> 02:25:03.451]  This comms team is doing actually a better job of Twitter.
[02:25:03.471 --> 02:25:05.093]  So what got Kelly to finally wake up?
[02:25:05.113 --> 02:25:09.297]  I mean, just the attacks on Trump, lying about him and how he handled the phone calls or what?
[02:25:10.259 --> 02:25:13.360]  Yeah, the way they politicized the death of his son.
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:15.681]  For Kelly, that was the red line.
[02:25:15.741 --> 02:25:19.703]  Kelly was devastated by the death of his... I mean, anybody would be devastated by the death of a child.
[02:25:20.503 --> 02:25:26.565]  And the way the media politicized the death... And he took it personal because Trump was saying exactly what Kelly wrote for him to say.
[02:25:26.785 --> 02:25:27.906]  Kelly took that really personal.
[02:25:28.846 --> 02:25:31.847]  Yeah, and then the media is going after him now and attacking him.
[02:25:32.228 --> 02:25:35.409]  And Kelly realizes, oh wait, these people fabricate information.
[02:25:36.189 --> 02:25:37.470]  They are liars, right?
[02:25:38.968 --> 02:25:39.788]  They are liars.
[02:25:39.849 --> 02:25:40.889]  They are fabricators.
[02:25:41.449 --> 02:25:43.951]  And Kelly now understands that you have to be aggressive.
[02:25:44.191 --> 02:25:45.932]  You have to go on the attack all the time.
[02:25:45.952 --> 02:25:49.834]  Just like Trump said in the press conference last week, he goes, people are finally getting, I have to punch back.
[02:25:50.854 --> 02:25:51.054]  Yeah.
[02:25:51.414 --> 02:25:52.455]  So Kelly's great now.
[02:25:52.615 --> 02:25:55.036]  Kelly goes on TV, he's talking about the Civil War.
[02:25:55.736 --> 02:25:58.538]  And now they're trying to say, oh, you support slavery.
[02:25:58.978 --> 02:26:00.519]  And so General Kelly, remember,
[02:26:01.368 --> 02:26:02.569]  This is an honorable man.
[02:26:02.929 --> 02:26:06.092]  I don't claim to be the most, you know, I'm a very flawed human being.
[02:26:06.412 --> 02:26:07.674]  I'm not a man like General Kelly.
[02:26:07.694 --> 02:26:15.300]  General Kelly is the kind of person who would have been a Roman senator, the kind of person who would have been beloved by historians throughout his life.
[02:26:15.701 --> 02:26:19.023]  He's what you would consider the best of America and the best of American values.
[02:26:19.784 --> 02:26:21.626]  And now he realizes, well, wait a minute.
[02:26:22.326 --> 02:26:23.688]  They're fabricating things about me.
[02:26:23.728 --> 02:26:25.649]  Now they're saying General Kelly likes slavery.
[02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:27.711]  They're making fun of his son's death.
[02:26:28.151 --> 02:26:30.173]  They're denigrating him, denigrating the service.
[02:26:30.694 --> 02:26:34.177]  He's realizing he's been compartmentalized inside the military, honorable people.
[02:26:34.517 --> 02:26:41.363]  He doesn't understand the scum we're dealing with and now he's having to wake up to the literal zombie scum attack.
[02:26:42.406 --> 02:26:44.607]  And now he realizes why we all go so hard.
[02:26:45.287 --> 02:26:49.408]  That was why he kept our articles kind of away from the President because he didn't understand.
[02:26:49.448 --> 02:26:54.130]  They're like, you know, he had said we're all too aggressive and we shouldn't be so divisive.
[02:26:54.450 --> 02:26:56.530]  You and I... We're under total attack!
[02:26:56.591 --> 02:26:57.911]  ...unite America.
[02:26:58.351 --> 02:26:59.852]  We want to bring Americans together.
[02:26:59.872 --> 02:27:01.393]  The media won't let us.
[02:27:01.893 --> 02:27:03.214]  The media divides.
[02:27:03.274 --> 02:27:16.260]  They're using divide and conquer tactics, hate rhetoric, terrorist rhetoric, apologizing for terrorism, telling people we need to have more terrorism, look the other way about terrorism, look the other way as they did for three decades about the rape and pedophilia in Hollywood.
[02:27:16.521 --> 02:27:17.901]  They're attacking Corey Feldman.
[02:27:18.342 --> 02:27:19.822]  Barbara Walters attacked Corey Feldman.
[02:27:19.842 --> 02:27:20.723]  That was my next question.
[02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:30.522]  Mainstream headlines, Hollywood accusers, harassers, molesters, rapists, that counts at 56 now confirmed rapists and molesters.
[02:27:31.062 --> 02:27:36.183]  I mean, this whole thing's coming down quicker than I thought, but what are the unforeseen blowback from this?
[02:27:38.243 --> 02:27:50.125]  Well, you and I, and we can pull that footage up, you and I said that Harvey Weinstein was given to the media as a sacrificial lamb, as a distraction from the pedophilia stuff.
[02:27:51.154 --> 02:27:52.576]  And then that was their ruse.
[02:27:52.636 --> 02:27:54.598]  That's why they gave the media Harvey Weinstein.
[02:27:54.618 --> 02:27:56.619]  Because the media didn't want to cover the pedophilia.
[02:27:57.220 --> 02:27:59.222]  But the pedophilia stuff is coming out now.
[02:27:59.242 --> 02:28:01.424]  It was going to come out one way or another.
[02:28:02.208 --> 02:28:08.152]  So I predicted that there was going to be a major pedophile scandal, then you have Kevin Spacey.
[02:28:09.032 --> 02:28:13.595]  And by the way, everybody always told me was a boy raper, basically.
[02:28:13.635 --> 02:28:15.956]  I mean, I had the makers of a major film here.
[02:28:15.976 --> 02:28:18.117]  We were like, well, let's not get into it because he's not in the film.
[02:28:18.137 --> 02:28:20.559]  But yeah, the word is Kevin Spacey is kind of a kingpin.
[02:28:21.843 --> 02:28:22.703]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:28:22.783 --> 02:28:33.789]  And now what I find interesting is that the fake news media will not interview the filmmaker about Hollywood pedophilia, so the filmmaker's going on RT to talk about it, and then people go, why did people go on RT?
[02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:37.811]  Well, because, why won't the media tell the truth about Hollywood pedophilia?
[02:28:38.971 --> 02:28:39.531]  Unbelievable.
[02:28:39.931 --> 02:28:42.573]  Let me ask you about November 4th when they kicked this thing off.
[02:28:42.693 --> 02:28:47.015]  I actually, my lawyers don't want me to get into it, but I mean literally, Al Gore,
[02:28:48.305 --> 02:28:52.652]  His whole deal, like telling me I better roll over by November 4th and all this other stuff.
[02:28:52.692 --> 02:28:57.460]  I mean... The Empire is on the run.
[02:28:57.961 --> 02:29:00.725]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[02:29:20.154 --> 02:29:24.856]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:33:05.672 --> 02:33:08.393]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.094 --> 02:33:19.175]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:35.769 --> 02:33:40.531]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:41.271 --> 02:33:46.933]  Two weeks ago, he was on the Jesse Waters Show and predicted there'd be big truck attack killings in places like New York.
[02:33:47.013 --> 02:33:47.873]  Two weeks later, it happened.
[02:33:47.893 --> 02:34:02.719]  Stephen Gern, highly decorated Marine, and of course, contractor with the company, who last year went public about when he's in these Islamic countries, almost all of them admit to his face, while he's training them to fight, that they would love to kill him.
[02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:09.791]  So he's here with us coming up in about five minutes to break down the latest with the 8 dead, 11 wounded.
[02:34:12.085 --> 02:34:16.448]  And this rat-like creature running around with his little toy gun after he's done it.
[02:34:16.869 --> 02:34:18.149]  I guess it's kind of bittersweet.
[02:34:18.189 --> 02:34:18.770]  He's alive.
[02:34:19.170 --> 02:34:22.072]  Wish he was dead, but I'm glad he's alive on the other side to get information.
[02:34:22.473 --> 02:34:29.017]  But Islam is definitely dovetailed with Antifa, George Soros, and Refuse Fascism.
[02:34:29.558 --> 02:34:33.220]  Same group that set up the Occupy Wall Street, as my producers were pointing out.
[02:34:33.601 --> 02:34:36.242]  Says the nightmare must end, the Trump-Pence regime must go.
[02:34:36.783 --> 02:34:37.944]  November 4th it begins.
[02:34:39.261 --> 02:34:39.742]  Be there.
[02:34:40.223 --> 02:34:43.849]  Join with thousands who will gather in cities and towns across the country.
[02:34:43.889 --> 02:34:50.981]  A movement of protest that continue every day and night, growing until we become millions determined not to stop until the regime is driven from power.
[02:34:51.342 --> 02:34:52.123]  This is the...
[02:34:53.624 --> 02:35:02.532]  Soros astroturf to line up with the neocons and the rhinos and the Democrats saying by December he will be gone.
[02:35:02.552 --> 02:35:03.853]  And Roger Stone was in D.C.
[02:35:03.873 --> 02:35:04.293]  yesterday.
[02:35:04.333 --> 02:35:05.654]  I've got all the names, the info.
[02:35:06.115 --> 02:35:09.298]  The Republicans are saying, yeah, Trump's gone in December.
[02:35:09.858 --> 02:35:12.940]  Yeah, and he wasn't going to get the nomination either, and then he wasn't going to get seated either.
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:15.502]  Mike Cernovich, what is your intel on this?
[02:35:16.022 --> 02:35:19.384]  Is this just them with all their threats and all their November 4th threats?
[02:35:19.404 --> 02:35:21.806]  You told me you've gotten some of the same legal threats now.
[02:35:22.186 --> 02:35:23.107]  I guess everybody's getting them.
[02:35:23.747 --> 02:35:26.529]  Are they just seeing who they can intimidate, or what is the point of this?
[02:35:26.549 --> 02:35:29.151]  Because all it's done is gotten me in pure fighting mode.
[02:35:29.191 --> 02:35:30.832]  I mean, they're walking on the fighting side of me.
[02:35:32.293 --> 02:35:35.975]  Yeah, they banned Roger Stone maliciously and without good cause.
[02:35:35.995 --> 02:35:36.335]  Permanently!
[02:35:36.496 --> 02:35:36.976]  Permanently!
[02:35:38.007 --> 02:35:38.247]  Right.
[02:35:38.847 --> 02:35:40.828]  And they can only push us so far.
[02:35:40.848 --> 02:35:42.128]  They've lost every time.
[02:35:42.448 --> 02:35:47.650]  They use their little alt-right saboteurish people to end our march on Google.
[02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:51.011]  But now that that's over, we'll just have a big march.
[02:35:51.331 --> 02:35:52.311]  We can have big marches.
[02:35:52.351 --> 02:35:53.292]  We can bring a lot of people out.
[02:35:53.312 --> 02:35:54.632]  And it shows how weak they are.
[02:35:54.652 --> 02:35:56.233]  They were so afraid of your Google march.
[02:35:57.473 --> 02:35:58.113]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:35:58.133 --> 02:36:03.915]  We were going to do a march on Google, and then they used Fed embeds with these alt-right morons in Charlottesville.
[02:36:04.971 --> 02:36:13.540]  By the way, our admitted Obama of Occupy Wall Street, three of them were formally funded by the Occupy Wall Street that's now refused fascism.
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:21.008]  I mean, it's totally obvious they're all little pretty boy, strumpet leftists who think they're smart enough to false flag us.
[02:36:22.378 --> 02:36:22.979]  Exactly.
[02:36:23.039 --> 02:36:25.842]  And then the next week we were supposed to have a march on Google.
[02:36:25.862 --> 02:36:30.148]  The fake news media, they lied about it and claimed it was a white nationalist rally.
[02:36:30.168 --> 02:36:31.309]  It was nothing of the sort.
[02:36:31.930 --> 02:36:35.234]  So the media was able to kill that with their false flag terrorist attack.
[02:36:35.694 --> 02:36:35.895]  But
[02:36:37.270 --> 02:36:37.971]  The demand is there.
[02:36:38.151 --> 02:36:38.871]  The people are there.
[02:36:39.372 --> 02:36:40.392]  The people want to do it.
[02:36:40.773 --> 02:36:42.254]  They can only push us so far.
[02:36:42.854 --> 02:36:51.840]  And these frivolous lawsuit threats, these attacks on the integrity of the people, the violence, the pedophilia, the rape coming out of Hollywood, people are done with it.
[02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:55.142]  And they need to be very, very careful who they're pushing around.
[02:36:56.463 --> 02:36:56.903]  Exactly.
[02:36:56.923 --> 02:36:58.024]  And everybody knows this.
[02:37:00.065 --> 02:37:01.566]  But we got to be strategic about it.
[02:37:03.459 --> 02:37:05.462]  But they're going to counter-strike.
[02:37:06.203 --> 02:37:09.789]  Historically, gut-level everything, humanity wants to be free.
[02:37:10.911 --> 02:37:12.894]  And authoritarianism is coming crashing down.
[02:37:12.934 --> 02:37:17.701]  They had America and the rest of the world kind of mesmerized by television and mainstream media for a while.
[02:37:18.922 --> 02:37:20.343]  But now people are coming out of the trance.
[02:37:49.102 --> 02:37:50.103]  I mean, this is epic.
[02:37:51.344 --> 02:37:52.385]  Yeah, they're drunk with power.
[02:37:52.445 --> 02:37:55.728]  Tony Podesta, of all people, threatening to sue Tucker Carlson.
[02:37:56.189 --> 02:37:58.471]  My God, I wish Tony Podesta would threaten to sue me.
[02:37:58.491 --> 02:38:07.279]  I want to talk about that subterranean basement where he watches dangerous works of art and other things that have been reported by the Guardian and the Washington Post.
[02:38:07.799 --> 02:38:11.683]  And public photos of little toddlers with their butts beat red.
[02:38:12.734 --> 02:38:17.996]  So I want to know, again, the Washington Post reported because they did a puff piece on Tony Podesta.
[02:38:18.516 --> 02:38:19.957]  That's how gross these people were.
[02:38:19.977 --> 02:38:21.297]  They got away with it for years.
[02:38:21.477 --> 02:38:27.380]  See, I'm not Mattiavelli, but once they do what I am, when the media made up Pizzagate off of the
[02:38:28.140 --> 02:38:29.441]  We're good to go.
[02:38:43.934 --> 02:38:52.942]  It's almost like, I didn't do it on purpose, but like a setup, because now I realize at a Machiavelli level, I get Podesta, his brother, his brother is saying, I like dangerous art.
[02:38:53.222 --> 02:38:54.363]  I watch it in a dungeon.
[02:38:54.663 --> 02:38:56.365]  It's naked little kids.
[02:38:56.585 --> 02:38:59.267]  Here's my neighbor kids with their butts paddled red.
[02:38:59.608 --> 02:39:03.751]  And I mean, I'm like, how does the Washington Post publish images of little kids' butts?
[02:39:04.852 --> 02:39:09.376]  And that was 2007, though, when they just thought they'd throw it in our face, Cernovich.
[02:39:09.716 --> 02:39:11.398]  And then I'm thinking, why am I scared of these people?
[02:39:11.678 --> 02:39:12.198]  Bring it on!
[02:39:12.218 --> 02:39:12.718]  Let's go!
[02:39:13.499 --> 02:39:15.480]  You know what?
[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:16.620]  Well, that's the whole issue.
[02:39:16.660 --> 02:39:18.941]  That's why I've never apologized.
[02:39:19.061 --> 02:39:23.543]  I always double down because they do view, because you got to remember they're satanic people.
[02:39:23.583 --> 02:39:24.483]  They're demonic people.
[02:39:25.063 --> 02:39:27.604]  They're used to abusing and exploiting the vulnerable.
[02:39:28.485 --> 02:39:31.086]  You cannot show them any weakness because you and I are good.
[02:39:31.166 --> 02:39:34.287]  If I do something wrong to you, I'll say, hey, Alex, you know, I didn't realize that.
[02:39:34.327 --> 02:39:34.887]  My apologies.
[02:39:34.907 --> 02:39:36.248]  And you'll say, apology accepted.
[02:39:36.986 --> 02:39:38.027]  This isn't how they live.
[02:39:38.047 --> 02:39:39.868]  They go, oh wait, you apologized.
[02:39:40.229 --> 02:39:41.490]  You must be a moral person.
[02:39:41.530 --> 02:39:42.631]  Maybe you're a Christian.
[02:39:43.011 --> 02:39:44.712]  Now I'm really going to go in on you.
[02:39:44.752 --> 02:39:46.634]  Now I'm really going to try to destroy you.
[02:39:46.974 --> 02:39:48.775]  They take your humanity as weakness.
[02:39:48.815 --> 02:39:50.757]  Like one time I actually gave up one of your sources.
[02:39:51.177 --> 02:39:52.058]  You didn't get really mad at me.
[02:39:52.118 --> 02:39:52.899]  I said, I had a brain fart.
[02:39:52.919 --> 02:39:53.359]  I apologize.
[02:39:53.379 --> 02:39:54.180]  He said, hey, that's okay.
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:56.361]  But it was, you didn't take it as like a power over me.
[02:39:57.342 --> 02:39:57.883]  But exactly.
[02:39:57.923 --> 02:39:58.603]  That's how they are.
[02:39:59.764 --> 02:40:00.184]  Yeah.
[02:40:00.304 --> 02:40:01.605]  I even forgot that even happened.
[02:40:02.066 --> 02:40:04.308]  But again, yeah, I never even brought it up ever again.
[02:40:04.328 --> 02:40:05.869]  You just realize that's life.
[02:40:06.727 --> 02:40:19.592]  But that's because I have more of a higher set of values, where I'll accept an apology, but these demonic, satanic people in DC, the people like the Podestas, who have no integrity, spirit cooking, let's talk about the spirit cooking, John Podesta.
[02:40:19.772 --> 02:40:28.015]  Oh yeah, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, here they are at an Aleister Crowley event, where he's being promised blood and semen to drink, and so we investigated it.
[02:40:29.975 --> 02:40:31.976]  Yeah, there's a lot I would love to talk to them about.
[02:40:32.896 --> 02:40:41.218]  I would love to sit down with John Podesta for hours and say, so have you ever drank soup that contained blood and semen?
[02:40:41.498 --> 02:40:45.520]  Because that's what the recipe book calls for.
[02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:48.080]  I can show you the dinner that you were invited to by Tony Podesta.
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:50.861]  So go ahead bro, let's talk about this.
[02:40:50.901 --> 02:40:52.682]  Let's talk about what you're into.
[02:40:52.702 --> 02:40:53.962]  Let's talk about the art.
[02:40:54.682 --> 02:41:00.867]  Let's talk about... Obama is getting a painting of him by an artist that paints it in semen.
[02:41:01.248 --> 02:41:05.752]  That the Obama official portrait is by a guy that paints in semen.
[02:41:07.633 --> 02:41:10.556]  Again, I would love to ask all these people these questions.
[02:41:10.576 --> 02:41:15.260]  They get really triggered when you talk about it, but maybe they need to learn what discovery looks like.
[02:41:15.300 --> 02:41:19.103]  Maybe they need to realize that, okay, once you sue somebody,
[02:41:19.838 --> 02:41:24.582]  And if you're suing them for defaming your so-called character, everything is an open book now.
[02:41:25.222 --> 02:41:27.244]  Remember that email they sent about Dennis Hastert?
[02:41:27.324 --> 02:41:29.145]  Oh, it's sad what happened to Dennis Hastert?
[02:41:29.905 --> 02:41:30.786]  I remember that email.
[02:41:31.647 --> 02:41:32.387]  The Podesta email.
[02:41:32.407 --> 02:41:32.668]  That's right.
[02:41:32.748 --> 02:41:36.951]  Even mainstream media had Hastert in the news recently criticizing Trump.
[02:41:37.531 --> 02:41:38.632]  And they didn't even put the article!
[02:41:38.652 --> 02:41:40.013]  He's a convicted boy-raper!
[02:41:40.393 --> 02:41:42.074]  Mike Cernovich, powerful info.
[02:41:42.094 --> 02:41:45.697]  Please join us as much as you can at Cernovich on Twitter while you're still there.
[02:41:46.157 --> 02:41:46.918]  And so much more.
[02:41:46.998 --> 02:41:47.959]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:41:48.769 --> 02:41:49.450]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[02:41:57.827 --> 02:42:17.457]  We're going to go to break and come back with the gentleman I was just talking about, Steven Gern, who again has videos with 50 million, 45 million, 48 million, you name it, just talking about, hey, I've been in the Marines, I've been a contractor, I work for the company, and I'm overseas, and I mean, the Muslims I'm training to defend their country admit they want to kill me, basically.
[02:42:19.858 --> 02:42:23.019]  You know, one of the security guys I got working here was one of them.
[02:42:23.079 --> 02:42:26.640]  I remember he heard eight guys trained 14,000 Iraqis or whatever.
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:27.561]  He's one of the guys.
[02:42:27.581 --> 02:42:30.682]  And they would just most admit, well, I will kill you when I'm told to.
[02:42:30.702 --> 02:42:32.582]  And you're like training them how to use a weapon.
[02:42:32.602 --> 02:42:33.923]  And they're telling you, I'm going to kill you.
[02:42:33.943 --> 02:42:35.643]  And it's just like, this is insane.
[02:42:36.284 --> 02:42:37.244]  This is what's going on.
[02:42:37.324 --> 02:42:40.265]  And then the cultural enrichment of Chuckie Schumer
[02:42:41.482 --> 02:42:43.023]  Bringing these guys into the country.
[02:42:43.824 --> 02:42:46.166]  And then he was on the news earlier blaming Trump.
[02:42:47.747 --> 02:42:49.409]  I mean, they got a lot of nerve.
[02:42:49.829 --> 02:42:53.773]  So, we're going to find out what next shoot-and-drop is straight ahead with our guest.
[02:42:53.833 --> 02:42:54.653]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:42:54.854 --> 02:42:56.075]  NewsWars.com.
[02:42:56.395 --> 02:42:56.935]  NewsWars.
[02:42:56.955 --> 02:42:57.476]  Spread the link.
[02:43:05.179 --> 02:43:09.486]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:43:12.438 --> 02:43:17.062]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[02:43:17.082 --> 02:43:19.023]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:43:19.403 --> 02:43:21.025]  B vitamins we need every day.
[02:43:21.205 --> 02:43:26.269]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[02:43:26.469 --> 02:43:28.170]  O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[02:43:28.831 --> 02:43:34.115]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory and lethargy.
[02:43:34.455 --> 02:43:34.775]  Secret 12.
[02:43:34.815 --> 02:43:35.596]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:43:36.276 --> 02:43:36.656]  I think so.
[02:44:06.628 --> 02:44:07.509]  USA!
[02:44:07.969 --> 02:44:08.810]  USA!
[02:44:09.310 --> 02:44:10.091]  USA!
[02:44:10.591 --> 02:44:11.372]  USA!
[02:44:11.732 --> 02:44:13.713]  Will Johnson was the founder of United America First.
[02:44:13.874 --> 02:44:15.695]  A movement began in the 2016 election.
[02:44:15.775 --> 02:44:18.137]  His desire is to unite the countries one person at a time.
[02:44:18.157 --> 02:44:22.160]  He was a Democrat prior to 16 when he woke up after two terms of Obama.
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:24.862]  UnitedAmericaFirst.com is his site.
[02:44:24.962 --> 02:44:29.385]  Will, where do we start here with the whole breakdown of what we see in this civilization?
[02:44:29.425 --> 02:44:32.768]  What's front and center at United America First for you right now?
[02:44:34.305 --> 02:44:38.068]  I guess front and center just bringing awareness to all the lawlessness that's going on.
[02:44:38.549 --> 02:44:40.510]  I mean you've been touching on it all day today.
[02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:41.551]  I've been watching your show.
[02:44:41.991 --> 02:44:50.257]  There is literally a war on white people in America and I think ultimately the objective is to get at Christianity because they want to remove Christianity.
[02:44:50.297 --> 02:44:58.984]  I mean just look how the liberal left, they're trying to bring in these Islamic terrorists into the country and the first people they're going to attack will be Christians.
[02:44:59.674 --> 02:45:00.995]  Specifically white Christians.
[02:45:01.255 --> 02:45:04.496]  Like I said, the majority of the people in America, they are white.
[02:45:05.057 --> 02:45:05.477]  That's just it.
[02:45:05.517 --> 02:45:07.978]  And the majority of the white people in America are Christians.
[02:45:08.738 --> 02:45:13.541]  And I think what's behind the whole thing is that they want to destroy this country.
[02:45:13.581 --> 02:45:14.601]  They're so upset.
[02:45:14.921 --> 02:45:23.785]  So when Donald J. Trump became president, they figured they would pick up the speed and just really start calling white people white supremacists, neo-Nazis, fascists.
[02:45:23.885 --> 02:45:26.947]  It's always been the left that always uses a person's sex
[02:45:27.407 --> 02:45:28.368]  They try to divide us.
[02:45:28.408 --> 02:45:29.609]  They try to use your religion.
[02:45:29.889 --> 02:45:31.530]  They try to use your nationality.
[02:45:31.771 --> 02:45:32.771]  They try to use your color.
[02:45:32.811 --> 02:45:34.253]  They always use something.
[02:45:34.333 --> 02:45:36.614]  They always say black people won't vote Trump.
[02:45:36.855 --> 02:45:38.756]  They always say gay people won't vote Trump.
[02:45:39.036 --> 02:45:41.638]  They always say intelligent women won't vote Trump.
[02:45:41.879 --> 02:45:45.281]  They always use something to try to divide us.
[02:45:45.541 --> 02:45:50.065]  But, you know, for the most part, you always hear conservatives always refer to us as Americans.
[02:45:50.942 --> 02:45:51.962]  Who are they going to vote for?
[02:45:52.403 --> 02:45:54.683]  It's always the other side that's bringing the division.
[02:45:55.024 --> 02:45:57.565]  They are in support of being lawless.
[02:45:58.205 --> 02:46:04.687]  I mean, the canvas that they're laying out and they're painting is just completely black.
[02:46:05.148 --> 02:46:11.290]  I mean, it's unbelievable that the state of America that we're in right now, and they're really pushing even more
[02:46:11.710 --> 02:46:11.991]  I think?
[02:46:27.169 --> 02:46:33.811]  I don't think ever before have I ever seen black people stand up for a president, specifically a white president, like now for Donald J. Trump.
[02:47:05.544 --> 02:47:08.426]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:08.446 --> 02:47:30.557]  It was a beautiful day Sunday dance
[02:47:31.061 --> 02:47:32.222]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:47:32.942 --> 02:47:36.245]  This is the InfoWar, and I'm not a hero.
[02:47:36.285 --> 02:47:36.925]  I'm nobody special.
[02:47:36.945 --> 02:47:39.668]  I'm just a common sense guy that isn't gonna take it lying down.
[02:47:39.688 --> 02:47:42.610]  I know you're not taking it lying down either.
[02:47:48.038 --> 02:48:01.886]  All these islamicists running around shooting, killing, stabbing and running people over every couple days in the western world is just a symptom, the cold sore rising to the top of the underlying illness of the leftists and the globalists and what they're doing.
[02:48:02.246 --> 02:48:07.429]  Why would Europe bring in 10 million islamicists, unvetted, 80% of military-age men?
[02:48:07.490 --> 02:48:11.832]  Because they say at the UN they want to break up the Christian society.
[02:48:12.052 --> 02:48:12.853]  The Pope says it!
[02:48:13.823 --> 02:48:16.825]  I mean, this is a globalist takeover of every institution.
[02:48:17.186 --> 02:48:18.367]  That Pope's not a Catholic.
[02:48:19.728 --> 02:48:20.728]  And most Catholics know that.
[02:48:21.549 --> 02:48:30.656]  So this is an incredible time to be alive, and the Left and Antifa and George Soros with full-page ads in the New York Times say they're launching it November 4th.
[02:48:31.136 --> 02:48:31.857]  All over the country.
[02:48:32.337 --> 02:48:36.200]  I should plug, we're going to be live from 11 a.m.
[02:48:36.380 --> 02:48:38.082]  until 8 p.m.
[02:48:39.182 --> 02:48:41.844]  Saturday, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:48:42.887 --> 02:48:46.490]  On our own feeds, as we're getting censored on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube.
[02:48:46.510 --> 02:48:50.054]  And if stations want to pick it up, they're welcome to, but it's going to be basically commercial-free.
[02:48:50.254 --> 02:48:51.996]  We'll air some breaks, but they won't be set breaks.
[02:48:52.596 --> 02:48:55.559]  And we're going to have reporters out in the field in different parts of the country.
[02:48:55.579 --> 02:48:59.062]  But this is a full launch, and they're calling for cop-killing.
[02:48:59.082 --> 02:49:01.725]  I mean, it says right here, overthrow the government.
[02:49:02.614 --> 02:49:04.095]  and drive Trump from power.
[02:49:04.796 --> 02:49:06.657]  And they have threatened us.
[02:49:06.938 --> 02:49:15.485]  I mean, I'm not at liberty to get into it right now, because obviously there's a lot of reasons not to, but I've been given ultimatums to surrender by Saturday.
[02:49:15.505 --> 02:49:20.889]  You know, when I'm tired, I get these threats, I suddenly have energy.
[02:49:21.170 --> 02:49:23.471]  And I mean, I don't get why they think these threats
[02:49:24.491 --> 02:49:24.851]  I don't know.
[02:49:45.962 --> 02:49:49.964]  And then they basically kicked him out of his contracting work, leading large teams.
[02:49:50.324 --> 02:49:56.806]  But he's here now, doing great with his own entrepreneurial operations, and speaking out and not being censored, and that's what it's all about.
[02:49:56.826 --> 02:49:58.887]  But understand, the fight is now, folks.
[02:49:59.167 --> 02:50:00.908]  This is the second American Revolution.
[02:50:01.108 --> 02:50:02.328]  They want it to be a civil war.
[02:50:03.369 --> 02:50:05.189]  But thank you, Steven Gern.
[02:50:05.369 --> 02:50:11.972]  You were here just a few days ago, and now another jihadi ala Akbar, or our God is greater than your attack.
[02:50:13.601 --> 02:50:14.382]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:50:14.402 --> 02:50:24.396]  You know, obviously I was on my way to Florida yesterday and got into Florida, was on my way to the hotel, and as soon as I get to the hotel, I see what's happened.
[02:50:25.117 --> 02:50:31.045]  The funny thing about it is, about a month and a half ago, I was on the Jesse Waters Show, and that's exactly what I said.
[02:50:31.425 --> 02:50:35.388]  It's exactly what they were doing in Spain, what they were doing in the EU, what they were doing in France.
[02:50:35.668 --> 02:50:40.071]  This was all how they were affecting their tactics so they can come here to the United States and do it.
[02:50:40.391 --> 02:50:42.472]  Now, obviously, we want to talk about gun control.
[02:50:42.532 --> 02:50:44.033]  We want to talk about all this craziness.
[02:50:44.334 --> 02:50:45.314]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:50:45.334 --> 02:50:46.335]  They didn't use a gun this time.
[02:50:46.355 --> 02:50:49.057]  What, he had a paint gun and a pellet gun.
[02:50:49.437 --> 02:50:52.559]  And I don't understand why that officer didn't, you know, shoot to kill.
[02:50:52.599 --> 02:50:55.201]  But obviously, that's not my gig.
[02:50:55.521 --> 02:50:56.762]  I'm glad that he actually didn't.
[02:50:56.802 --> 02:51:00.444]  So now we can interrogate this individual if we're going to be able to interrogate him.
[02:51:00.504 --> 02:51:01.065]  I doubt we will.
[02:51:01.545 --> 02:51:06.387]  Because there's so many bleeding hearts out there that we're not even going to be able to properly interrogate this individual.
[02:51:06.888 --> 02:51:15.212]  But, you know, this seems to be something that it's happened here in the United States before, it's happened all over the EU, and it's going to continue to happen.
[02:51:15.672 --> 02:51:25.917]  And unless we don't start doing what we need to do with proper vetting, just like President Donald Trump said in the very beginning, we are going to see a lot more of this because they are paving the road
[02:51:26.457 --> 02:51:36.564]  To allow this to happen in the United States and the left not accepting what's actually happening here and the people who just don't want to accept that this is not the norm.
[02:51:36.624 --> 02:51:41.167]  I heard yesterday on Fox News an individual say we need to accept this as the norm.
[02:51:41.407 --> 02:51:42.988]  No, we don't need to accept this as the norm.
[02:51:43.208 --> 02:51:46.390]  They accepted it as the norm in the UK and you see what's happened to their country.
[02:51:46.710 --> 02:51:49.613]  It cannot happen here in the United States and it will not happen in the United States.
[02:51:49.894 --> 02:51:53.778]  The only people who can stop that are people like you and me who want to put a stand.
[02:51:54.038 --> 02:51:56.541]  We want to stand and put a stop to what's happening here.
[02:51:56.561 --> 02:52:00.565]  If our officials, if our elected officials aren't going to do it, we need to do it here.
[02:52:01.426 --> 02:52:02.327]  Right here on our level.
[02:52:02.568 --> 02:52:04.350]  On the local and the state levels.
[02:52:05.572 --> 02:52:06.332]  Absolutely.
[02:52:06.813 --> 02:52:08.633]  And almost all these guys are inbred.
[02:52:08.693 --> 02:52:10.714]  They wear these women's nightgowns.
[02:52:12.215 --> 02:52:14.375]  They just wander around on welfare all day.
[02:52:14.395 --> 02:52:18.077]  And then they just tell us how they're elite and we're scum and then kill us.
[02:52:18.477 --> 02:52:22.759]  And we're supposed to bow down to this guy who brought in 28 of his rat-like family.
[02:52:24.780 --> 02:52:25.460]  It's unbelievable.
[02:52:25.540 --> 02:52:26.400]  And what's happening?
[02:52:26.640 --> 02:52:28.501]  They're being attached to a visa program.
[02:52:28.541 --> 02:52:29.962]  This is what it all comes down to.
[02:52:30.022 --> 02:52:31.102]  Again, here we are with the vetting.
[02:52:31.502 --> 02:52:33.263]  They're coming in on a visa
[02:52:34.426 --> 02:52:39.029]  Yeah, a program which is like a lottery, is what they call it, a lottery.
[02:52:39.289 --> 02:52:41.471]  And it's BS, it's complete BS.
[02:52:41.511 --> 02:52:42.011]  And you know what it is?
[02:52:42.031 --> 02:52:43.252]  It's like Logan's Run.
[02:52:43.332 --> 02:52:44.693]  It's a death lottery for us.
[02:52:44.953 --> 02:52:49.957]  And like you said, Khan, the Islamist mayor of London, keeps saying, get used to it, get used to it, accept it.
[02:52:50.197 --> 02:52:51.058]  Don't even put it in the news.
[02:52:51.238 --> 02:52:55.661]  They want us to accept them coming in and us bowing to them and them murdering us.
[02:52:56.889 --> 02:52:57.309]  Exactly.
[02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:58.670]  There is no acceptance of this.
[02:52:58.750 --> 02:53:03.072]  It's just like, you know, in Islam and Sharia law, there is no acceptance.
[02:53:03.112 --> 02:53:04.333]  There is no tolerance there.
[02:53:04.653 --> 02:53:07.654]  You're either Sharia compliant or you're not Sharia compliant.
[02:53:07.974 --> 02:53:13.557]  You're either in submission to their God, because as they point out, you know Arabic better than I. He didn't say Allah Akbar.
[02:53:13.757 --> 02:53:15.038]  He said our God is greater.
[02:53:15.078 --> 02:53:15.658]  What's the difference?
[02:53:17.301 --> 02:53:24.865]  Well, Allah Akbar, it means, you know, God is great, but usually what you'll see is you'll see people coming up and they're doing the whole number one sign.
[02:53:25.106 --> 02:53:26.006]  It's not a number one sign.
[02:53:26.046 --> 02:53:29.068]  What he's doing is pointing up to Allah, that Allah is the greatest.
[02:53:29.408 --> 02:53:31.710]  And that's exactly what it is, and that's their thought process.
[02:53:31.970 --> 02:53:33.911]  He was what we would call Sharia compliant.
[02:53:34.591 --> 02:53:40.355]  And we were talking about this, as a matter of fact, on that Jesse Waters show, he had said something to me, and I wanted to go ahead and clarify it.
[02:53:40.735 --> 02:53:42.656]  If you are Sharia compliant,
[02:53:43.360 --> 02:53:47.483]  Okay, if you are a Sharia-compliant Muslim, this is what you want to do.
[02:53:47.563 --> 02:53:48.364]  This is Jihad.
[02:53:48.865 --> 02:53:51.667]  What he did is committed Jihad and that is how they win.
[02:53:51.707 --> 02:53:55.310]  That is like the lottery for them to commit Jihad.
[02:53:55.330 --> 02:53:56.270]  That is the ultimate.
[02:53:56.791 --> 02:53:58.452]  So, that's what he has done.
[02:53:58.492 --> 02:54:01.795]  He committed Jihad and that's where we are right now.
[02:54:02.055 --> 02:54:03.016]  This is what's happening.
[02:54:03.896 --> 02:54:23.733]  Sure, what do you make from your sources, and we've got our sources, but it's them, they say they're going to launch all sorts of hell come this Saturday, and we're already seeing, I think this is a tremor for more that's going to come as we see Islamists and ISIS coordinating with the Black Lives Matter and with the Antifa.
[02:54:24.926 --> 02:54:28.909]  Yeah, and this is what we were talking about, you know, earlier about the Marxist movement.
[02:54:29.169 --> 02:54:38.835]  This is two groups, or three groups of people, one on one side, one on the other side, moving parallel against what we believe in, against our Constitution, trying to destroy our Constitution.
[02:54:39.509 --> 02:54:43.490]  Our constitution is the longest lasting constitution in the world.
[02:54:44.030 --> 02:54:46.970]  And we must maintain that, and we must continue to fight for it.
[02:54:47.250 --> 02:54:59.833]  And the people who don't want to do it, like Antifa, you know, I don't think the Islamic State has anything to do with what Antifa and Black Lives Matter is, but they are able to piggyback off of what is happening.
[02:55:00.113 --> 02:55:00.973]  And you've got your George Soros.
[02:55:00.993 --> 02:55:07.214]  That's right, because all the groups think they're going to end up in charge, so the enemy of my enemy is my friend, another Islamic sting.
[02:55:08.100 --> 02:55:08.940]  You're exactly right.
[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:09.840]  And that's all they're doing.
[02:55:09.860 --> 02:55:10.841]  They're piggybacking off it.
[02:55:11.081 --> 02:55:18.043]  They're seeing that what they're doing is actually creating these, you know, ripples in the water, as you can see, and they're piggybacking off it.
[02:55:18.063 --> 02:55:19.083]  And this is a huge problem.
[02:55:19.403 --> 02:55:27.165]  So it isn't just about stopping the Muslim Brotherhood, Antifa, Black Lives Matter, Islamic State.
[02:55:27.385 --> 02:55:28.445]  We need to stop them all.
[02:55:28.605 --> 02:55:29.625]  We need to stop them all.
[02:55:29.685 --> 02:55:31.646]  And we need to have solid
[02:55:32.768 --> 02:55:33.789]  Policies to do it.
[02:55:33.849 --> 02:55:35.931]  And you know, I'm not even worried about policies at this point.
[02:55:36.191 --> 02:55:42.897]  You know, I said something about, you know, the suit-wearing jihadist versus the pajama-wearing jihadist.
[02:55:42.917 --> 02:55:43.877]  We gotta worry about them all.
[02:55:44.598 --> 02:55:45.339]  And that's the thing.
[02:55:45.419 --> 02:55:46.820]  They know they have missions.
[02:55:46.900 --> 02:55:47.981]  They know they're committed.
[02:55:48.321 --> 02:55:49.082]  They admit it.
[02:55:50.143 --> 02:55:53.325]  And so we have to be just as committed to stop playing games.
[02:55:53.626 --> 02:55:54.867]  People think, oh, that's a bunch of work.
[02:55:55.367 --> 02:55:59.351]  No, we have to have purpose-driven lives, ladies and gentlemen, like our ancestors did.
[02:55:59.651 --> 02:56:01.532]  This is the animating contest of liberty.
[02:56:02.673 --> 02:56:05.896]  Let me guess, I bet you're even happier after 20 years overseas.
[02:56:07.077 --> 02:56:10.901]  Now you're really home, in the real republic, in the homeland, when the fight's key.
[02:56:10.941 --> 02:56:16.546]  I mean, let me guess, are you happier now, back home, even with them persecuting you, standing up for what's right?
[02:56:18.307 --> 02:56:19.168]  You want to know what?
[02:56:19.488 --> 02:56:21.350]  At least over there I knew who my enemy was.
[02:56:22.495 --> 02:56:24.996]  I knew exactly who it was, I knew exactly what I needed to do.
[02:56:25.356 --> 02:56:35.559]  Here, the lines are so blurry, and every time you turn around and you call somebody an Islamic terrorist, or you say that it was terrorism, or you say Muslim, or anything like that, you're the one who's persecuting for it.
[02:56:35.719 --> 02:56:47.503]  No, I understand it's harder in some ways because it's the fog of complexity and war, geopolitical war, political war, but I'm saying, is it fulfilling to now be reaching tens of millions of people every week though?
[02:56:48.803 --> 02:56:51.564]  It is, it's very fulfilling, and I hope I can reach a lot more people.
[02:56:52.103 --> 02:56:54.525]  And, you know, this is just the start.
[02:56:54.585 --> 02:56:55.606]  It shouldn't be the start.
[02:56:55.626 --> 02:56:57.107]  We should never have got to the point where we are.
[02:56:57.567 --> 02:56:58.908]  But the point... But we're now awake.
[02:56:58.948 --> 02:56:59.549]  Stay right there.
[02:56:59.569 --> 02:57:02.711]  We're going to come right back with Stephen Gern who predicted these attacks.
[02:57:03.072 --> 02:57:03.732]  Great patriot.
[02:57:03.972 --> 02:57:06.855]  Before I go any further, we're going to co-host some with him and Roger Stone coming up.
[02:57:07.830 --> 02:57:08.932]  I gotta plug one minute an hour.
[02:57:09.392 --> 02:57:10.654]  Without you, we're not here.
[02:57:11.115 --> 02:57:17.845]  So whether it's t-shirts, or water filters, or non-GMO heirloom seeds, or high-quality organic coffee, it's great.
[02:57:18.265 --> 02:57:18.806]  It's all there.

[02:57:33.538 --> 02:57:36.460]  We could not do it without you, but we need continued support.
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:38.701]  So I don't want to just stay at the same size under attack.
[02:57:39.001 --> 02:57:39.882]  I want to dominate.
[02:57:39.962 --> 02:57:40.602]  I want to grow.
[02:57:40.923 --> 02:57:43.284]  I want to give my full exertion against the Globalists.
[02:57:43.504 --> 02:57:47.266]  We are winning, but they are launching counter-offensives right now.
[02:57:47.607 --> 02:57:48.047]  Stay with us.

[02:59:00.319 --> 02:59:01.820]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:59:02.881 --> 02:59:07.483]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[02:59:07.503 --> 02:59:09.463]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:59:09.844 --> 02:59:11.424]  B vitamins we need every day.
[02:59:11.644 --> 02:59:16.726]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.

[02:59:27.876 --> 02:59:32.581]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.

[02:59:54.765 --> 03:00:00.652]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.823 --> 03:00:11.765]  We're good.
[03:00:13.470 --> 03:00:19.595]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:00:19.875 --> 03:00:21.917]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.377 --> 03:00:26.560]  And the resistance is in your mind to Hollywood, the globalists, all of it.
[03:00:26.680 --> 03:00:29.262]  And for all my foibles, I am passionate.
[03:00:29.443 --> 03:00:30.103]  I am upset.
[03:00:30.684 --> 03:00:31.224]  I am angry.
[03:00:31.304 --> 03:00:32.105]  I'm territorial.
[03:00:32.485 --> 03:00:37.409]  I've studied history, and I see we're being conquered by a bunch of globalist opportunists.
[03:00:37.429 --> 03:00:40.051]  But I see Hollywood, their whole system falling apart.
[03:00:40.071 --> 03:00:42.353]  But I wonder, how do they think they're going to bring in
[03:00:44.247 --> 03:00:44.647]  Millions.
[03:00:44.667 --> 03:00:46.749]  I mean, there's just Muslim refugees all over Austin.
[03:00:46.769 --> 03:00:47.770]  They weren't here five years ago.
[03:00:47.890 --> 03:00:48.470]  It's just everywhere.
[03:00:48.891 --> 03:00:51.873]  New York, London, you think it's like an Islamic city.
[03:00:52.293 --> 03:00:53.954]  And then my thing is, they're rude to you.
[03:00:53.994 --> 03:00:54.755]  They're mad at you.
[03:00:54.835 --> 03:00:57.417]  Once they become the dominant group, they're not accepting.
[03:00:57.457 --> 03:00:58.418]  They kill gay people.
[03:00:58.458 --> 03:00:59.619]  They enslave women.
[03:00:59.899 --> 03:01:01.060]  And you're not supposed to say that.
[03:01:01.420 --> 03:01:02.220]  Then the left's all...
[03:01:03.081 --> 03:01:07.044]  Jake Tapper, you know, said, oh beautiful, God is greater, God is great.
[03:01:07.344 --> 03:01:08.185]  It's so beautiful.
[03:01:08.665 --> 03:01:13.529]  When it was reported that the guy was screaming Allah Akbar, I already played the clip five times, I'm not going to play it again.
[03:01:13.549 --> 03:01:15.250]  And it's like, what a sick freak.
[03:01:15.270 --> 03:01:17.012]  But no, he thinks that's his muscle.
[03:01:17.912 --> 03:01:19.494]  See, Jake Tapper is a psychopath.
[03:01:20.074 --> 03:01:22.474]  He takes us being nice as weak.
[03:01:22.835 --> 03:01:25.035]  He sees Muslims willing to kill people as strong.
[03:01:25.375 --> 03:01:27.915]  He wants to cozy up as a sycophantic piece of crap.
[03:01:28.636 --> 03:01:31.256]  Am I accurate in saying that?
[03:01:31.376 --> 03:01:37.797]  Or is that an oversimplification, Mr. Gern?
[03:01:37.817 --> 03:01:41.038]  No, I think you're accurate in saying it.
[03:01:41.558 --> 03:01:46.839]  Really, what I'm seeing here is people think that these guys are doing what's right.
[03:01:47.918 --> 03:01:56.546]  Well, in a way, in Islam, they are doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing.
[03:01:56.606 --> 03:02:01.491]  For this guy to say he was beautiful, I really don't get it.
[03:02:01.531 --> 03:02:06.336]  And that's really what I'm having a hard time with now, is that people
[03:02:07.310 --> 03:02:10.074]  Like this individual are accepting of what's happening here.
[03:02:10.294 --> 03:02:11.616]  We saw what happened in the EU.
[03:02:11.636 --> 03:02:13.458]  We see what's happening all over in the UK.
[03:02:14.079 --> 03:02:15.541]  There's no way... That's the talking point.
[03:02:15.641 --> 03:02:23.031]  Accept it and say it's beautiful as a good, cocked, Stockholm Syndrome person like Tapper.
[03:02:24.450 --> 03:02:27.852]  I heard it last night, and I just, I got so mad.
[03:02:28.633 --> 03:02:33.696]  It was unbelievable to hear somebody say, we need to accept this as the norm.
[03:02:34.176 --> 03:02:35.257]  Accept this as the norm.
[03:02:35.677 --> 03:02:38.639]  No, this isn't the norm, and this isn't what we need to be accepting at all.
[03:02:38.959 --> 03:02:39.620]  Not one bit.
[03:02:40.040 --> 03:02:45.163]  We are America, and we believe in our rights, we believe in our Constitution, and we need to hold to it.
[03:02:45.563 --> 03:02:52.207]  And anybody who doesn't believe in that, I'm sorry to say, but you need to go someplace else, because that's not the way it runs here in the United States of America.
[03:02:53.588 --> 03:02:54.370]  It's a formula.
[03:02:54.490 --> 03:02:58.656]  They're trying to get us, like Sweden, to go under mass stocking syndrome.
[03:02:58.696 --> 03:02:59.517]  They know what they're doing.
[03:02:59.797 --> 03:03:06.828]  If they can get us to accept Muslims murdering us with enjoyment with knives, guns, and trucks, then I guess we'll put up with anything.
[03:03:06.848 --> 03:03:09.491]  I mean, that's like Nambla's out saying, give us your kids now.
[03:03:10.799 --> 03:03:11.580]  Yeah, it is.
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:13.943]  And again, you know, here we are.
[03:03:14.023 --> 03:03:16.706]  If we're not willing to fight, then we will fall.
[03:03:17.166 --> 03:03:18.027]  That's all there is to it.
[03:03:18.488 --> 03:03:20.310]  If we're not willing to fight... Well, I want to fight.
[03:03:20.390 --> 03:03:20.951]  What do I do?
[03:03:21.011 --> 03:03:22.432]  I'm trying as hard as I can to spread the word.
[03:03:22.472 --> 03:03:23.153]  What else can I do?
[03:03:23.433 --> 03:03:24.454]  Because, I mean, I'll be honest with you.
[03:03:24.495 --> 03:03:28.139]  Sometimes, I just can't put up with much more.
[03:03:29.758 --> 03:03:30.218]  You know what?
[03:03:30.558 --> 03:03:32.340]  This is what I think, okay?
[03:03:32.380 --> 03:03:38.863]  First of all, I think we need to go to our local law enforcement, our local state, our local councils, and we need to start informing them.
[03:03:38.903 --> 03:03:40.324]  We need to inform them.
[03:03:40.664 --> 03:03:43.806]  We need to get them educated on what the threat is.
[03:03:44.667 --> 03:03:54.893]  There's a company, actually, it's an organization called Understanding the Threat, and they are 100% dedicated to, and Frank Gaffney with the Center of Security Policy.
[03:03:54.933 --> 03:03:55.673]  Yeah, let's get him on.
[03:03:56.914 --> 03:03:58.695]  Yeah, absolutely, is dedicated to
[03:04:00.140 --> 03:04:06.927]  Informing people of what this threat is and what they're capable of and how they're infiltrating us in the United States.
[03:04:07.468 --> 03:04:11.212]  And yes, what we saw yesterday was an act of jihad.
[03:04:11.713 --> 03:04:20.822]  Although, how are we allowing this to happen is because we are losing on a lot of fronts when it comes to the political
[03:04:22.637 --> 03:04:25.740]  I won't say the political, but the policy side of the house.
[03:04:26.160 --> 03:04:32.445]  Because you have people like, or not people, but organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood who have infiltrated our government.
[03:04:32.465 --> 03:04:33.746]  You know, this is a short segment.
[03:04:33.786 --> 03:04:34.147]  Stay there.
[03:04:34.187 --> 03:04:35.928]  Do one more with us and Roger Stone's joining us.
[03:04:36.328 --> 03:04:39.131]  Because I want you to come and spend like five minutes on understanding the threat.
[03:04:39.571 --> 03:04:41.673]  Because I was even, you know, a tolerant guy.
[03:04:41.713 --> 03:04:42.734]  I was never pro-Islam.
[03:04:43.034 --> 03:04:47.779]  But I still bought into some of the, let's be nice stuff, maybe they'll listen.
[03:04:48.079 --> 03:04:49.801]  That's just taken as weakness, folks.
[03:04:50.301 --> 03:04:53.905]  And sure, you got Muslims that are slaved to other Muslims who mean well and aren't bad people.
[03:04:53.985 --> 03:05:00.431]  But any practicing Sharia-compliant person, you're going to submit or they're going to kill you, and they're just waiting to do it.
[03:05:03.496 --> 03:05:10.181]  Listeners, this is hardcore info, and it's groundbreaking information, and it's all financed by your support and the work you do.

[03:05:13.083 --> 03:05:16.685]  I'm very excited to announce that DNA Force has been sold out for almost four months.
[03:05:16.865 --> 03:05:22.789]  It's very hard to source the super organic, high quality, suitable medical grade, BioPQQ and CoQ10 and other things.
[03:05:23.149 --> 03:05:28.253]  It is back in stock, 25% off, ladies and gentlemen, and we have a limited supply of that.
[03:05:28.713 --> 03:05:30.575]  But you're just such great patrons and supporters.
[03:05:30.595 --> 03:05:31.336]  I want to cut the price.
[03:05:31.356 --> 03:05:33.218]  We also have Biome Defense.
[03:05:33.318 --> 03:05:34.599]  Amazing, super high quality.
[03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:37.903]  Highest quality we can produce with top firms of probiotic.
[03:05:38.684 --> 03:05:39.845]  That's been sold out for months.
[03:05:40.185 --> 03:05:41.246]  That's now back in stock.
[03:05:41.266 --> 03:05:42.327]  Limited run of that.
[03:05:42.468 --> 03:05:45.371]  And there's a bunch of other sales that are ending today.
[03:05:45.931 --> 03:05:47.553]  Bio-True Selenium, 40% off.

[03:05:52.757 --> 03:05:54.378]  Anthroplex, 50% off.
[03:05:54.418 --> 03:05:56.080]  Those have to end today.
[03:05:56.480 --> 03:05:59.803]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:06:13.866 --> 03:06:15.967]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:16.427 --> 03:06:19.509]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:23.090 --> 03:06:33.335]  Steven Gern, decorated Marine, and she called him paramilitary with the company, doing different operations all over the world, is our guest.
[03:06:33.435 --> 03:06:37.797]  And in comes Trump, he says we're gonna ban folks from these seven countries, they don't have real passports.
[03:06:38.217 --> 03:06:40.999]  The media freaks out, and then it's Chuckie Schumer,
[03:06:42.475 --> 03:06:58.563]  An Obama's program that brings in a guy and 28 of his family to be put on welfare and walk around in his diaper outfit all day, bitching at everybody, and then killing a bunch of people, and the media tries to cover up that it's Islamic attackers.
[03:06:58.603 --> 03:07:06.007]  The New York Times today, mile-long Manhattan truck attack kills eight, not an Islamic
[03:07:07.213 --> 03:07:09.814]  ISIS attack kills eight, using truck.
[03:07:10.515 --> 03:07:10.835]  No!
[03:07:11.775 --> 03:07:13.056]  No, it's a truck attack.
[03:07:13.676 --> 03:07:16.078]  And then right beside it, rise up, overthrow Trump.
[03:07:16.658 --> 03:07:18.939]  A full page ad in the same section.
[03:07:19.299 --> 03:07:19.780]  Wow.
[03:07:20.200 --> 03:07:22.781]  Funded by George Soros, who brings in the Islamists.
[03:07:24.582 --> 03:07:24.862]  Wow.
[03:07:25.002 --> 03:07:27.223]  So, finishing up, you were getting into what do we do.
[03:07:27.243 --> 03:07:27.784]  I agree.
[03:07:28.204 --> 03:07:29.645]  We've got to go out and speak out.
[03:07:30.424 --> 03:07:36.049]  We've got to go out to city councils everywhere and say the politically incorrect things to break their will.
[03:07:36.549 --> 03:07:37.830]  They want to scare everybody else.
[03:07:39.151 --> 03:07:40.212]  They're not having free speech.
[03:07:41.032 --> 03:07:46.157]  We have to exercise it up front so that others who are more timid have the courage.
[03:07:46.197 --> 03:07:47.478]  This is an information war.
[03:07:47.758 --> 03:07:50.200]  So recap what you were saying, Stephen Gern.
[03:07:51.564 --> 03:07:56.767]  What I'm saying is, in order for us to fight this, we need to be able, we're not going to be able to do it on the big government level.
[03:07:56.807 --> 03:07:58.788]  It's just not going to happen, because they don't want to accept it.
[03:07:59.028 --> 03:08:06.171]  What we need to do is we need to go to our local law enforcement, our local magistrates, our local councils, and so on and so forth, our local churches.
[03:08:06.231 --> 03:08:08.412]  We need to go out there and we need to educate these people.
[03:08:08.852 --> 03:08:13.235]  The people who don't want to be educated, the people who don't want to accept what we have to say, we don't waste time on them.
[03:08:13.255 --> 03:08:14.655]  There's no reason to waste time on them.
[03:08:14.935 --> 03:08:17.977]  I'm not going to beg somebody to understand what's happening here.
[03:08:18.377 --> 03:08:20.178]  I'm going to point out the things that are actually
[03:08:20.718 --> 03:08:26.040]  Effective, and how we can do to stop this, you know, penetrating force that we currently have.
[03:08:26.381 --> 03:08:38.186]  And by doing that, you're going to be able to bring on, basically, you're putting together an army in understanding the threat, understanding what exactly is going on here in the United States.
[03:08:38.786 --> 03:08:48.250]  And until we understand that, until we educate the younger generations, until we, you know, educate ourselves to understand what Islam is, what
[03:08:48.823 --> 03:08:51.164]  You know, Islamic law is all about.
[03:08:51.244 --> 03:08:55.225]  And what they're asking us or telling us or making us do, we can't.
[03:08:55.526 --> 03:08:58.287]  If we don't identify this threat, how can you fight it?
[03:08:58.587 --> 03:09:01.148]  The first thing you do in any war is identify your threat.
[03:09:01.428 --> 03:09:02.468]  And we're not identifying it.
[03:09:02.508 --> 03:09:03.048]  We're still not.
[03:09:03.269 --> 03:09:05.609]  The Obama, Obama, he never identified it.
[03:09:05.669 --> 03:09:08.571]  And you just said right there, they didn't identify the threat.
[03:09:08.611 --> 03:09:10.531]  They said it was a truck that drove through.
[03:09:10.771 --> 03:09:11.132]  Negative.
[03:09:11.212 --> 03:09:12.472]  It wasn't a truck that drove through.
[03:09:12.852 --> 03:09:15.033]  It was an Islamic terrorist act.
[03:09:15.393 --> 03:09:16.033]  That's what it was.
[03:09:16.153 --> 03:09:17.474]  It was an act of jihadism.
[03:09:18.971 --> 03:09:22.532]  And if you want to know who's in charge, it's who you can't criticize.
[03:09:23.373 --> 03:09:31.736]  To think about this, to see the persecution of people that talk about it, when the biggest victims of Islam are the people living in Islamic countries.
[03:09:31.756 --> 03:09:36.398]  Spend a minute on that, and all the countries you've been in, how these people live, how women are treated.
[03:09:37.796 --> 03:09:38.897]  Well, it's unbelievable.
[03:09:38.977 --> 03:09:42.399]  I mean, those women, they don't even exist, okay?
[03:09:42.439 --> 03:09:50.844]  I mean, I remember going over there, you know, my very first time, and the women are in the back of the trucks while the men are driving in the front, and they're out there, you know, doing everything.
[03:09:51.224 --> 03:09:53.285]  So, the women, it doesn't exist at all.
[03:09:53.325 --> 03:09:55.046]  There is no women's rights whatsoever.
[03:09:55.127 --> 03:09:57.368]  So, anybody who believes that there is, there's just not.
[03:09:57.928 --> 03:09:59.509]  Um, it doesn't matter.
[03:09:59.529 --> 03:10:02.690]  They kill each other in mass numbers.
[03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:03.870]  In mass numbers!
[03:10:04.150 --> 03:10:06.351]  They talk about, you know, what America's done.
[03:10:06.791 --> 03:10:09.332]  Just look at what happens in Iraq every day, in Baghdad.
[03:10:09.712 --> 03:10:12.053]  You know, vehicle bombs going off, killing 100 people.
[03:10:12.373 --> 03:10:13.133]  It's the norm!
[03:10:13.233 --> 03:10:15.254]  It's the norm over there, and it can't be the norm here.
[03:10:15.574 --> 03:10:19.635]  And that's the problem, is people aren't seeing that people are just evil.
[03:10:19.695 --> 03:10:22.856]  They don't care about anything, and maybe the reason why this
[03:10:24.997 --> 03:10:26.798]  I can't figure out what the end game is.
[03:10:26.898 --> 03:10:28.859]  I'm trying to figure that out in such a way just
[03:10:53.790 --> 03:10:58.151]  It baffles me that... The left hates America and hates Christianity and is ugly.
[03:10:58.551 --> 03:11:00.371]  And it's a form of cucking.
[03:11:00.451 --> 03:11:04.072]  They want, just like devil worshippers want to sacrifice a child to be bad.
[03:11:04.372 --> 03:11:06.093]  This is just an act of nastiness.
[03:11:07.533 --> 03:11:08.253]  You're right, Liz.
[03:11:08.353 --> 03:11:13.634]  I mean, it just seems like the left is all about destroying everything that we're about.
[03:11:14.134 --> 03:11:20.255]  Whether it's Christianity, whether it's, you know, the Constitution, whatever it is.
[03:11:20.275 --> 03:11:22.116]  It's just, they want anarchy.
[03:11:22.156 --> 03:11:23.136]  It doesn't make any sense.
[03:11:24.019 --> 03:11:33.731]  And again, if we don't, if we don't educate ourselves, we don't educate their generations and work with people to understand what we're facing, we are going to lose this fight.
[03:11:33.771 --> 03:11:34.913]  We cannot lose this fight.
[03:11:37.299 --> 03:11:44.460]  I just, I see, like you said, CNN, MSNBC, even Fox News saying, it's the new norm, relax, let's just not talk about it.
[03:11:44.800 --> 03:11:52.742]  But when some scumbag, lunatic, white terrorist goes and kills poor, innocent black people, nine of them, every white person was to blame.
[03:11:52.842 --> 03:11:54.022]  Every southerner was to blame.
[03:11:54.122 --> 03:11:55.182]  Every Christian was to blame.
[03:11:55.462 --> 03:11:56.322]  And I went, wait a minute.
[03:11:56.822 --> 03:11:57.702]  We're a diverse group.
[03:11:57.722 --> 03:11:58.643]  We're not to blame for him.
[03:11:58.663 --> 03:11:59.623]  But I decry what he did.
[03:11:59.883 --> 03:12:02.223]  But when Islam does it, oh, Islam's not involved.
[03:12:02.463 --> 03:12:06.184]  When, like you said, he was following exactly what Mohammed said to do.
[03:12:07.606 --> 03:12:10.329]  Exactly, and again, we go back to identifying our threat.
[03:12:10.390 --> 03:12:17.638]  If we don't identify it, which we won't, I mean, okay, so, you know, we have a guy who went in there into a black church, and he goes and kills a bunch of people, okay?
[03:12:17.879 --> 03:12:18.379]  What did we do?
[03:12:18.419 --> 03:12:18.920]  What did we say?
[03:12:18.960 --> 03:12:27.210]  We said, oh, well, he's a racist, and, you know, the Confederate flag is a racism flag, so we're gonna get rid of all the Confederate flags, now we're gonna get rid of all the statues.
[03:12:28.070 --> 03:12:31.631]  So okay, now he killed them with a truck.
[03:12:31.992 --> 03:12:33.952]  So are we going to go ban all the trucks now?
[03:12:34.012 --> 03:12:35.153]  Is that what the Democrats are going to do?
[03:12:35.173 --> 03:12:38.434]  We're going to go ban all the trucks that are being rented?
[03:12:39.054 --> 03:12:42.315]  No, they don't want to identify the actual threat, the threat that it was.
[03:12:42.335 --> 03:12:45.736]  Is the person and the diseased ideology?
[03:12:47.637 --> 03:12:49.197]  It's not an ideology.
[03:12:49.717 --> 03:12:50.597]  It is what they believe.
[03:12:50.798 --> 03:12:51.598]  It is 100% what they believe.
[03:12:53.220 --> 03:12:54.121]  Islam is Islam.
[03:12:54.361 --> 03:12:57.863]  There is no, you know... So you're saying it's not a sub-ideology?
[03:12:58.043 --> 03:12:58.663]  That's what I meant.
[03:12:58.883 --> 03:13:00.024]  It's the political Islam.
[03:13:00.084 --> 03:13:03.926]  It is the conquering, cancerous, orthodox Islam.
[03:13:05.106 --> 03:13:07.848]  Yeah.
[03:13:08.869 --> 03:13:10.329]  It's what they're trying to get us to accept.
[03:13:10.349 --> 03:13:16.913]  But, you know, I'm having a hard time accepting it myself, so... Well, here's the deal.
[03:13:18.376 --> 03:13:24.318]  We can't let this continue and we can't lose our rights while they don't even want to profile people.
[03:13:24.338 --> 03:13:27.039]  You know, five years ago, the FBI tried to arrest him.
[03:13:27.099 --> 03:13:27.719]  Obama wouldn't.
[03:13:27.979 --> 03:13:28.920]  Just like San Bernardino.
[03:13:29.260 --> 03:13:34.681]  The FBI agents that investigated those guys two years before were under criminal investigation for civil rights violation.
[03:13:35.002 --> 03:13:42.484]  Obama's Justice Department tried to put FBI and federal marshals in jail for investigating the San Bernardino shooters.
[03:13:42.844 --> 03:13:44.845]  Two years before, they should have gotten medals!
[03:13:46.494 --> 03:13:47.355]  Exactly, they should have.
[03:13:47.395 --> 03:13:57.062]  And again, what it comes back to is it comes back to if you identify somebody who you think may not be right and you expose that person, what happens?
[03:13:57.723 --> 03:13:58.684]  You get beat up for it.
[03:13:58.744 --> 03:13:59.664]  You get called a racist.
[03:13:59.684 --> 03:14:00.585]  You get called a bigot.
[03:14:00.885 --> 03:14:01.486]  And that's the thing.
[03:14:01.506 --> 03:14:02.687]  And that's what I said on the other show.
[03:14:03.568 --> 03:14:09.252]  If you see something that's not right and you don't say something, all you're doing is allowing this to happen.
[03:14:10.344 --> 03:14:12.366]  For me, if I see something that's not right, you know what?
[03:14:12.386 --> 03:14:18.509]  If they're going to call me a name because of it, if it prevents a terrorist attack, then that's what I'm going to go ahead and do.
[03:14:18.529 --> 03:14:19.750]  And again, the terror attacks are bad.
[03:14:19.770 --> 03:14:20.691]  We're sorry for those that died.
[03:14:20.711 --> 03:14:25.534]  But again, there's the overarching drive politically of why is this being done?
[03:14:25.794 --> 03:14:26.775]  What's going on?
[03:14:26.795 --> 03:14:30.077]  And then you look at Hollywood and all their hate of just anything good.
[03:14:30.097 --> 03:14:31.958]  It's just degeneracy.
[03:14:32.518 --> 03:14:33.441]  All right, my friend.
[03:14:33.802 --> 03:14:37.331]  Facebook.com forward slash Steven dot G-E-R-N.
[03:14:37.832 --> 03:14:39.316]  Steven Gern, thank you so much.
[03:14:39.637 --> 03:14:41.121]  We look forward to having you back on very soon.
[03:14:42.202 --> 03:14:42.482]  All right.
[03:14:42.502 --> 03:14:42.863]  Thank you.
[03:14:42.903 --> 03:14:43.563]  Appreciate it, Alex.
[03:14:43.603 --> 03:14:44.284]  Hope you have a good day.
[03:14:44.544 --> 03:14:44.885]  You bet.
[03:14:45.345 --> 03:14:50.550]  Yeah, that guy has hundreds of millions of views on his videos and, you know, 6,000 followers on Twitter.
[03:14:50.570 --> 03:14:52.252]  A lot more folks need to follow that.
[03:14:52.292 --> 03:15:00.300]  Now, Roger Stone's hosting the Balance of the Hour, and then he's going to be hosting Into the War Room in studio with Owen Schroyer.
[03:15:01.120 --> 03:15:03.423]  So, Roger Stone, tell us what you got coming up.
[03:15:04.721 --> 03:15:21.222]  Well, Alex, we're going to talk about what has been learned from the JFK documents we exclusively broke here at InfoWars, the President's bold and courageous decision to release the classified documents pertaining to the murder of President John F. Kennedy.
[03:15:22.203 --> 03:15:32.994]  We're going to talk about the tug-of-war with the intelligence services and their efforts to mount a rear-guard action and cover up, through censorship, the guts of those.
[03:15:33.594 --> 03:15:37.998]  And it'll all be here on the Alex Jones Show and then the War Room.
[03:15:38.579 --> 03:15:39.540]  With Roger Stone.
[03:15:39.640 --> 03:15:40.180]  Stay with us.
[03:15:40.381 --> 03:15:41.281]  Infowars.com.
[03:15:41.321 --> 03:15:42.523]  Newswars.com.
[03:15:42.683 --> 03:15:44.564]  I know I keep saying it, but it's the truth.
[03:15:44.605 --> 03:15:45.385]  We're under attack.
[03:15:45.926 --> 03:15:46.586]  Our only hope
[03:15:47.387 --> 03:15:49.690]  Is that you spread the word, but here's the secret.
[03:15:50.071 --> 03:15:50.992]  We're your hope as well.
[03:15:51.072 --> 03:15:52.054]  We're in this together.
[03:15:52.074 --> 03:15:52.614]  Stay with us.
[03:16:02.532 --> 03:16:04.693]  Globalization has not been an unalloyed good.
[03:16:04.833 --> 03:16:05.893]  I am a free trader.
[03:16:05.913 --> 03:16:07.914]  I am a strong supporter of globalization.
[03:16:08.494 --> 03:16:13.336]  Globalization doesn't seem to be working for the middle class, for ordinary people.
[03:16:13.536 --> 03:16:17.157]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[03:16:17.617 --> 03:16:21.799]  The rise of nationalist movements all over the world has a counterbalance to
[03:16:22.999 --> 03:16:26.940]  Globalization, maybe it's most marked with the European economic community.
[03:16:27.340 --> 03:16:33.641]  To simultaneously erect a system where the top is so far from the bottom, that the bottom has no connection to the top.
[03:16:34.401 --> 03:16:43.523]  The old rules-based system is beginning to crumble, hastened by Brexit in Britain and in the European Union, and hastened by what President Trump is standing for.
[03:16:43.803 --> 03:16:45.824]  Americanism, not globalism!
[03:16:46.704 --> 03:16:48.085]  Well be our credo!
[03:16:48.445 --> 03:16:51.108]  The global governance is failing.
[03:16:52.028 --> 03:17:05.439]  The globalists had already thought they had full control of America and then the world are in total panic mode in an existential battle seeing their entire authoritarian world government crumble and collapse in front of them.
[03:17:05.979 --> 03:17:29.991]  And so George Soros funds Media Matters, CNN, MSNBC, all these legal groups that are openly suing Trump thousands of times, setting up and suing us as well, trying to sabotage our suppliers, trying to shut down our support base, trying to get us kicked off radio and TV, trying to have us criminally investigated, trying to have us shut down.
[03:17:30.791 --> 03:17:37.416]  But I have the Republic behind me and common sense and an awake population to defend against you.
[03:17:37.997 --> 03:17:45.903]  I'm not those poor, sad, hard-working Eastern European peasants that you helped round up for four years when you sent them to death camps, Soros.
[03:17:46.423 --> 03:17:48.665]  And you thought you could bring down America.
[03:17:48.925 --> 03:17:51.027]  You're going to find out we're not going to go so easy.
[03:17:51.587 --> 03:17:54.910]  So he's $18 billion in to this fight right now.
[03:17:55.370 --> 03:18:02.754]  But here's the good news, Hillary had almost 3 billion dollars, Trump had about 400-500 million, but he had the people, and so he won.
[03:18:03.214 --> 03:18:10.578]  And so this force-feeding of his culture war, and trying to buy off groups, isn't gonna help him, it's gonna blow up in his face.
[03:18:10.958 --> 03:18:14.020]  Because no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[03:18:14.620 --> 03:18:17.102]  So I'm asking listeners and viewers of this transmission,
[03:18:18.317 --> 03:18:44.240]  Now more than ever to understand, when you spread the articles, when you spread the videos, when you spread the live feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show, or Facebook, Google, Twitter, or other platforms, or you spread the podcast, and when you buy the products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are involved in a revolutionary act against these globalists, because pennies against their thousands of dollars, and millions against their billions, is already defeating them and will defeat them.
[03:18:44.480 --> 03:18:52.187]  The fact that he's going to have to put in hundreds of times a year what he put in previously of his stolen loot just kills him!
[03:18:52.767 --> 03:19:00.734]  So I'm asking you, as the enemy ups their power against us, as the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[03:19:01.114 --> 03:19:10.122]  And InfoWars is imperfect, but we are seen by the enemy as the standard, as one of the main standard-bearer operations against them, and that's why we're under attack.
[03:19:10.342 --> 03:19:14.485]  So rally around the flag, my friends, and financially support us today!
[03:19:14.865 --> 03:19:15.346]  Commit!

[03:19:42.719 --> 03:19:52.541]  That's the pill form of Super Mel Vitality and a bunch of other specials that are about to end at InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:52.601 --> 03:19:59.783]  That will make this operation continue strong in the face of the enemy, and we will defeat these scum.
[03:20:05.603 --> 03:20:08.325]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.597 --> 03:20:24.418]  I wish a buck was still silver.
[03:20:24.438 --> 03:20:27.881]  I wish a buck was still silver.
[03:20:28.562 --> 03:20:32.605]  It was back when the country was strong.
[03:20:33.666 --> 03:20:34.787]  Back before Elvis.
[03:20:37.287 --> 03:20:43.111]  Hard to turn Merle Haggard off, isn't it?
[03:21:04.426 --> 03:21:08.470]  Hard to believe 2017's the year he died.
[03:21:09.351 --> 03:21:12.434]  So many people we lost this year.
[03:21:13.595 --> 03:21:15.217]  Stop rolling downhill!
[03:21:18.320 --> 03:21:26.688]  Well let me tell ya, that's finally turned around.
[03:21:26.728 --> 03:21:27.729]  The pendulum's swinging back.
[03:21:31.315 --> 03:21:35.238]  I'm going to hand the baton to Rogers.
[03:21:35.278 --> 03:21:37.700]  He's going to be on for hours coming up with Owen Schroyer.
[03:21:38.060 --> 03:21:38.981]  He has so much to get to.
[03:21:39.001 --> 03:21:47.628]  And if I was up here saying, we're the heart of the rebellion, we're the tip of the spear, you're the resistance, we're changing the world.
[03:21:48.128 --> 03:21:50.150]  If it wasn't true, it'd be comical.
[03:21:51.631 --> 03:21:56.875]  But when I sit back and I realize it's not talk, it's not even a good feeling.
[03:21:56.955 --> 03:21:57.715]  It's like a...
[03:21:59.768 --> 03:22:00.769]  Sickening feeling.
[03:22:01.589 --> 03:22:10.715]  But sickening in a good way, like, it's so epic, so real, so timeless, so big, that you can feel the victory.
[03:22:11.795 --> 03:22:14.057]  You can see the finishing line.
[03:22:15.077 --> 03:22:18.880]  But you know it's gonna take everything you got to claw across it.
[03:22:19.838 --> 03:22:24.683]  But then you look back at tyranny and other nations that have fallen and who wants to conquer us?
[03:22:25.383 --> 03:22:27.746]  A bunch of devil-worshipping pedophiles.
[03:22:28.126 --> 03:22:28.987]  Don't just say that!
[03:22:29.087 --> 03:22:30.008]  That's who they are!
[03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:34.813]  And you're like, I need more energy to beat these people!
[03:22:35.834 --> 03:22:37.816]  It's the opposite of feeling strong or confident.
[03:22:37.996 --> 03:22:41.039]  It's feeling like, we need to get more strength!
[03:22:42.320 --> 03:22:44.122]  We need everything to defeat these people!
[03:22:46.004 --> 03:22:47.004]  That's my frustration.
[03:22:47.044 --> 03:22:50.005]  It isn't fear when they come after me of what they'll do to me.
[03:22:50.065 --> 03:22:51.265]  It's fear that I'm too weak.
[03:22:53.426 --> 03:22:59.847]  I mean, when you think about these pedophiles we're up against, ladies and gentlemen, you think about the scum of the earth we're fighting.
[03:22:59.867 --> 03:23:00.727]  I mean, that's who they are.
[03:23:01.307 --> 03:23:05.868]  They've organized these forces globally and how bad they are and what they're doing to us.
[03:23:05.968 --> 03:23:08.169]  And you realize we have a chance to break their will.
[03:23:09.149 --> 03:23:10.069]  They want to break our will.
[03:23:11.089 --> 03:23:17.675]  That's why I'm telling you, when you share the articles, the videos, the links, we're seeing more censorship the last few months than we saw 10 years before.
[03:23:19.597 --> 03:23:25.622]  And soon I'll be able to reveal to you the stuff they're doing behind the scenes, but strategically we're not revealing it yet.
[03:23:26.909 --> 03:23:30.594]  But they already tried to destroy my life and my family, and I'm not complaining.
[03:23:31.215 --> 03:23:33.338]  I told everybody I'm asking for it.
[03:23:33.658 --> 03:23:34.760]  I'm willing to do it.
[03:23:35.541 --> 03:23:39.086]  I just need you to know that it's not just you're watching Alex Jones or Roger Stone.
[03:23:39.827 --> 03:23:42.370]  When you pray for us, number one.
[03:23:43.362 --> 03:23:43.802]  Providence.
[03:23:44.323 --> 03:23:48.606]  When you spread the links, the articles, the videos, the material and talk to people in person.
[03:23:48.886 --> 03:23:59.653]  When you go down to city council or other places and speak out where they can't censor you or at the soapbox or the church in the third dimension, not just online, it moves the world and gets more lemmings out of their trance.
[03:24:00.034 --> 03:24:01.094]  Now is the time of awakening.
[03:24:01.515 --> 03:24:04.837]  And when you financially support us and just commit to do it.
[03:24:07.099 --> 03:24:13.200]  Sign up for AutoShip on whatever products it is that you need to reorder, whether it's coffee or supplements or, you know, whatever.
[03:24:14.281 --> 03:24:15.121]  It changes the world.
[03:24:16.521 --> 03:24:23.343]  And I'm coming to you because it's like a man calling for a glass of wine before he fights or whatever, like they used to say.
[03:24:24.663 --> 03:24:26.743]  It's not even out of courage you do it.
[03:24:27.304 --> 03:24:28.724]  It's out of your tool of life.
[03:24:29.775 --> 03:24:35.121]  You know, you're so awake, and you just want to ensure that you're not overconfident, and that you've got what it needs.
[03:24:35.141 --> 03:24:37.703]  Because in this war, like any war, money is king.
[03:24:39.765 --> 03:24:43.009]  And so, just go buy the supplements, buy the books, buy the videos, buy it all.
[03:24:43.449 --> 03:24:44.270]  Buy it aggressively.
[03:24:44.330 --> 03:24:45.371]  Put bumper stickers up.
[03:24:45.431 --> 03:24:45.972]  Get aggressive.
[03:24:46.172 --> 03:24:47.053]  Start your own show.
[03:24:47.113 --> 03:24:47.634]  Do your own thing.
[03:24:47.674 --> 03:24:48.354]  I'll have you on.
[03:24:48.855 --> 03:24:50.116]  I want to win.
[03:24:50.136 --> 03:24:52.359]  I want to get these people off our backs.
[03:24:53.544 --> 03:24:56.745]  Look, we didn't start this fight, but man, I'm not taking it lying down.
[03:24:57.085 --> 03:24:58.465]  And I will defeat them.
[03:24:58.825 --> 03:25:00.346]  I will defeat John Podesta.
[03:25:00.646 --> 03:25:01.886]  I will defeat Hillary Clinton.
[03:25:02.186 --> 03:25:06.427]  I will defeat Hillary, all her minions and Soros and all of them.
[03:25:08.128 --> 03:25:10.968]  It's not like we're in business fighting with each other over a contract.
[03:25:11.528 --> 03:25:14.549]  These people want to literally erase the Renaissance.
[03:25:15.809 --> 03:25:17.070]  They are a bunch of scum.
[03:25:18.052 --> 03:25:19.273]  Who are threatened by freedom.
[03:25:19.934 --> 03:25:24.319]  And I will not bow to them and their inbred hordes of Islamists they're bringing in.
[03:25:24.379 --> 03:25:25.320]  I will not bow.
[03:25:25.760 --> 03:25:27.782]  And I'm getting ready to go flamethrowing.
[03:25:28.523 --> 03:25:32.067]  And I don't say that out of the position of like, oh, I'm about to get even tougher.
[03:25:32.387 --> 03:25:34.690]  I know how times are, seasons are.
[03:25:35.090 --> 03:25:36.211]  Now is the time.
[03:25:37.130 --> 03:25:43.059]  For all of us politically to really turn it loose and really give them our full fight.
[03:25:43.539 --> 03:25:46.784]  Roger Stone for the next couple hours is hosting right into War Room coming up.
[03:25:47.084 --> 03:25:48.486]  Roger, thanks for letting me jump in here.
[03:25:48.747 --> 03:25:51.030]  But listeners, please support us today.
[03:25:51.150 --> 03:25:52.071]  Make the commitment or...
[03:25:53.578 --> 03:25:56.401]  We're already going to have great victory into the future off of all the things we've done.
[03:25:56.421 --> 03:25:59.605]  And I know we're going to win, but I want to win handily.
[03:25:59.745 --> 03:26:02.668]  And it's so easy if you commit to buy the products.
[03:26:03.309 --> 03:26:04.169]  We will expand.
[03:26:04.230 --> 03:26:05.391]  We won't just continue on.
[03:26:05.411 --> 03:26:06.052]  We will expand.
[03:26:06.352 --> 03:26:07.513]  We'll be victorious.
[03:26:07.793 --> 03:26:08.374]  Roger, go ahead.
[03:26:08.394 --> 03:26:09.015]  Sorry for taking over.
[03:26:10.402 --> 03:26:11.883]  Alex, many thanks.
[03:26:12.243 --> 03:26:17.286]  You know, I think it was Nietzsche that said, that which does not kill me makes me stronger.
[03:26:18.067 --> 03:26:19.768]  I agree with Alex Jones.
[03:26:20.088 --> 03:26:34.137]  Do the lefties not understand that these personal attacks on us, these threats to kill my wife, my family, my children, and perhaps worst of all, my beloved dogs, this only
[03:26:34.517 --> 03:26:52.421]  Makes me angrier and stronger and more firm in my resolve to expose the globalists, to expose the globalists and expose those who would destroy the foundations and principles of America.
[03:26:53.202 --> 03:26:56.542]  CBS has a little film that they put up.
[03:26:56.562 --> 03:27:02.724]  Let's show that because it shows you how vicious the attack has become.
[03:27:18.071 --> 03:27:19.591]  We're having some technical difficulties.
[03:27:19.892 --> 03:27:22.252]  We're doing two studios between each other today, but that's okay.
[03:27:22.292 --> 03:27:25.813]  It's live, it's worldwide, and we're going to break here in a minute.
[03:27:25.833 --> 03:27:34.495]  We'll probably come back over there, but for radio listeners, we can go over some of this for people and just break down how savage and how vicious they've gotten.
[03:27:34.715 --> 03:27:35.755]  How long is this clip, guys?
[03:27:35.795 --> 03:27:38.636]  And then I can introduce it to you, and we can come back to it after the break.
[03:27:39.958 --> 03:27:42.019]  We'll come back to it after the break.
[03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:45.401]  Coming up, we're going to take your calls.
[03:27:45.661 --> 03:27:46.962]  So I want to point out, 888-201-2244.
[03:27:46.982 --> 03:27:53.586]  We're going to be taking them both in the Balance of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:27:53.606 --> 03:27:55.667]  We're going to be taking them in the War Room as well.
[03:27:56.147 --> 03:28:04.512]  This is my favorite part of being on InfoWars because so many people, as I move around, ask me, why don't you take more calls?
[03:28:04.572 --> 03:28:08.194]  They like the interactive nature of what we do here.
[03:28:08.475 --> 03:28:10.556]  And we like to hear from patriots.
[03:28:10.616 --> 03:28:12.717]  We want to hear what's on your mind.
[03:28:13.057 --> 03:28:22.063]  And while you're at it, I want to say one more time, BrainForce at an extraordinary discount right now on the InfoWars.com store.
[03:28:22.543 --> 03:28:31.885]  I was up all night last night, folks, in Washington, D.C., doing high-level meetings to try to get a grip on what the globalists have in mind for our president.
[03:28:32.365 --> 03:28:37.447]  And without brain force, I would be unable, literally, to do this broadcast.
[03:28:37.467 --> 03:28:42.508]  And by the way, Roger, you've got the intel coming up that they plan to remove Trump by December.
[03:28:42.548 --> 03:28:43.588]  I forgot to bring that up.
[03:28:43.968 --> 03:28:45.848]  And he's got that CBS clip coming up, too.
[03:28:46.169 --> 03:28:47.289]  Roger Stone, straight ahead.
[03:28:47.309 --> 03:28:47.689]  Stay with us.
[03:28:52.936 --> 03:28:54.398]  We are on the march.
[03:28:54.859 --> 03:28:57.262]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:28:57.783 --> 03:29:00.546]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:01.903 --> 03:29:06.226]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[03:29:06.687 --> 03:29:11.730]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[03:29:12.271 --> 03:29:16.194]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[03:29:16.234 --> 03:29:19.536]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[03:29:20.197 --> 03:29:24.660]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[03:29:25.280 --> 03:29:28.543]  It's you the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[03:29:29.243 --> 03:29:30.785]  I came in here an hour ago.
[03:29:31.525 --> 03:29:38.749]  And I literally just went to InfoWarsStore.com and printed the five-star reviews, the first few pages.
[03:29:39.049 --> 03:29:42.851]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[03:29:43.452 --> 03:29:46.933]  And it's five-star after five-star after five-star.
[03:29:47.294 --> 03:29:48.975]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[03:29:49.435 --> 03:29:55.758]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:29:55.798 --> 03:29:56.699]  Let's go over them right now.
[03:29:57.259 --> 03:29:58.760]  This is Verified Buyer Mark.
[03:29:58.940 --> 03:30:01.902]  Five-star review for AnthroPlex for men and women.
[03:30:02.382 --> 03:30:03.423]  I take it as directed.
[03:30:03.443 --> 03:30:14.329]  As one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[03:30:14.889 --> 03:30:15.570]  Easy does it.
[03:30:15.650 --> 03:30:16.671]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[03:30:16.691 --> 03:30:17.651]  It's very, very serious.
[03:30:18.051 --> 03:30:18.472]  Not a game.
[03:30:18.492 --> 03:30:18.892]  Thank you, Mark.
[03:30:19.392 --> 03:30:20.693]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[03:30:20.833 --> 03:30:21.614]  Energy all day.
[03:30:21.634 --> 03:30:29.359]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[03:30:29.799 --> 03:30:30.500]  Another review.
[03:30:30.520 --> 03:30:31.520]  I love this one.
[03:30:31.820 --> 03:30:34.262]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[03:30:34.642 --> 03:30:38.165]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[03:30:38.445 --> 03:30:41.367]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[03:30:41.747 --> 03:30:43.289]  Here's another one, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:47.035]  Five Star Review for Winter Sun, Vitamin D3.
[03:30:47.315 --> 03:30:50.500]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[03:30:50.560 --> 03:30:55.287]  I don't get sick last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[03:30:55.427 --> 03:30:56.408]  Amazing product.
[03:30:57.109 --> 03:30:59.210]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[03:30:59.630 --> 03:31:00.630]  Here's one from Brian.
[03:31:00.951 --> 03:31:03.031]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[03:31:03.151 --> 03:31:03.992]  Thank you all.
[03:31:04.392 --> 03:31:08.033]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[03:31:08.093 --> 03:31:10.314]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[03:31:10.714 --> 03:31:12.655]  Every night owl should have this product.
[03:31:13.155 --> 03:31:16.596]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[03:31:16.856 --> 03:31:17.497]  And I should add,
[03:31:18.297 --> 03:31:19.438]  That's a great name for this product.
[03:31:19.698 --> 03:31:21.519]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[03:31:21.539 --> 03:31:23.260]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[03:31:23.600 --> 03:31:24.921]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[03:31:25.001 --> 03:31:26.602]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[03:31:26.642 --> 03:31:27.202]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[03:31:27.462 --> 03:31:29.103]  I said I'd shut up!
[03:31:29.123 --> 03:31:29.884]  But back to the script.
[03:31:30.244 --> 03:31:32.125]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[03:31:32.145 --> 03:31:32.885]  I love that name too.
[03:31:33.326 --> 03:31:35.347]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[03:31:35.647 --> 03:31:39.849]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[03:31:39.889 --> 03:31:42.451]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[03:31:42.531 --> 03:31:43.951]  You make it literally possible.
[03:31:45.012 --> 03:31:49.798]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million colloidal silver out there.
[03:31:50.338 --> 03:31:53.162]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[03:31:53.462 --> 03:31:57.006]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[03:31:57.527 --> 03:31:59.529]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be.
[03:32:00.750 --> 03:32:03.232]  I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[03:32:03.592 --> 03:32:05.694]  This was the first product I purchased from InfoWare Store.
[03:32:06.014 --> 03:32:11.898]  Whenever I feel the first hazes of cold or sore throat coming on, a dozen Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[03:32:12.318 --> 03:32:18.062]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015 and it's worked for everyone.
[03:32:18.542 --> 03:32:24.926]  It has become an expected gift for our family and that's why we get you the best products because we want to repeat customers.
[03:32:25.187 --> 03:32:26.007]  It's all a win-win.
[03:32:26.167 --> 03:32:27.048]  That's an awesome review.
[03:32:27.108 --> 03:32:30.350]  Thank you Dale for your support and for what you've done for your family as well.
[03:32:30.350 --> 03:32:32.371]  Well, we've only got 20 seconds left, folks.
[03:32:32.431 --> 03:32:35.394]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Caveman reviews.
[03:32:35.414 --> 03:32:36.594]  They're all five-star.
[03:32:36.835 --> 03:32:42.198]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[03:32:42.839 --> 03:32:46.141]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[03:32:46.421 --> 03:32:48.223]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[03:32:48.523 --> 03:32:52.045]  Find it all, folks, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:32:52.065 --> 03:32:57.189]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[03:33:05.499 --> 03:33:10.203]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.010 --> 03:33:29.400]  All right, Roger, I'm going to take you live.
[03:33:44.867 --> 03:33:46.748]  Welcome back.
[03:33:46.968 --> 03:33:51.311]  I am Roger Stone sitting in for my compatriot Alex Jones.
[03:33:51.391 --> 03:33:54.453]  I'm a proud member of the InfoWars team.
[03:33:54.794 --> 03:34:13.026]  And it was here on InfoWars that it was revealed to the world that President Donald Trump would declassify the controversial, still secret, and closely held John F. Kennedy assassination records.
[03:34:13.806 --> 03:34:30.618]  You see, in 1992, the Congress, in the wake of the impact of Oliver Stone's monumental film, JFK, passed legislation that set specific timelines for the release of this bombshell data.
[03:34:31.883 --> 03:34:50.619]  Even in the initial releases in the 80s and 90s, the Deep State, the military-industrial complex, indeed those responsible for the murder of President Kennedy, managed to redact and censor and hold back much of the data.
[03:34:51.567 --> 03:35:08.800]  When I spoke to the President of the United States two Thursdays ago, only two days before his historic tweet announcing that he would release this classified information, he was most interested in transparency.
[03:35:09.560 --> 03:35:12.622]  He was most interested in full disclosure.
[03:35:13.583 --> 03:35:38.362]  And as I predicted, the Deep State, the Central Intelligence Agency principally, caught by surprise, had to move into high gear on a rear guard action to redact, that means black out, censor and hold back as much of the data as possible, hoping that the American people would learn little.
[03:35:39.022 --> 03:35:51.574]  And that their myth that Lee Harvey Oswald, a communist nut, acting alone, shot President John Fitzgerald Kennedy three times from the back.
[03:35:52.805 --> 03:36:00.211]  Unfortunately now, thanks to President Trump's courageous and bold decision, that narrative hasn't held up.
[03:36:00.491 --> 03:36:01.572]  What have we learned?
[03:36:01.672 --> 03:36:14.543]  Well, one paragraph that was brought to the fore in this release shows that the Surgeon General of the United States concluded that John Kennedy had been shot from the front
[03:36:15.343 --> 03:36:27.710]  And that the bullet entered at the neck, at the trachea, which is why a tracheotomy was hastily performed on him to hide that entry wound.
[03:36:28.170 --> 03:36:30.312]  Big problem for the government.
[03:36:30.752 --> 03:36:32.073]  What else did we learn?
[03:36:32.173 --> 03:36:41.078]  Well, we learned that the Russian KGB conducted their own independent investigation into John Kennedy's murder.
[03:36:41.778 --> 03:36:52.949]  And they determined that Lyndon Baines Johnson, LBJ himself, old big ears, was the man who orchestrated the death of his predecessor.
[03:36:53.749 --> 03:37:05.541]  You see, Lyndon Johnson knew that the Kennedy Justice Department was hot on his heels in both the Bobby Baker and Billy Sal Estes corruption investigations.
[03:37:06.161 --> 03:37:17.767]  And he knew that Attorney General Robert Kennedy wanted him not only off the 1964 ticket, but he also want him in a federal presidential, a federal penitentiary.
[03:37:18.287 --> 03:37:21.769]  Yes, LBJ was the man staring into the abyss.
[03:37:22.935 --> 03:37:33.602]  We also learned in the new disclosures that French intelligence, at the request of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, conducted their own investigation.
[03:37:34.163 --> 03:37:41.288]  And they determined that Lyndon Baines Johnson was the ringleader of the plot to kill our president.
[03:37:42.108 --> 03:37:43.249]  What else did we learn?
[03:37:43.329 --> 03:37:53.938]  Well, we learned that Lyndon Johnson, as a young congressman in his early political career, was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.
[03:37:53.958 --> 03:37:58.262]  That puts him up there with Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia.
[03:37:58.843 --> 03:38:05.689]  No wonder they wanted this information withheld and kept from the American people.
[03:38:06.289 --> 03:38:28.158]  After all, Lyndon Johnson, who styles himself the civil rights president, even though in his years in the Senate he blocked every major piece of voting rights, housing rights, or civil rights legislation, was reinventing himself for the consumption of the American voters.
[03:38:28.778 --> 03:38:31.800]  LBJ, a member of the KKK,
[03:38:32.580 --> 03:38:45.054]  We also learned that the government was aware of two witnesses who saw two men running from the site of the murder of the Dallas police officer J.D.
[03:38:45.154 --> 03:38:53.222]  Tippett, and that neither one of those men met the physical description of Lee Harvey Oswald.
[03:38:54.352 --> 03:39:06.585]  We also learned that the casings found on the ground at the site of Oswald's alleged shooting of Tippett were from an automatic weapon.
[03:39:07.166 --> 03:39:16.736]  Yet, when Lee Harvey Oswald is arrested at the Texas Movie Theater, only minutes later, he's found with a revolver.
[03:39:18.191 --> 03:39:27.077]  So more and more information coming to the fore from President Donald Trump's historic decision.
[03:39:28.017 --> 03:39:40.445]  Next up is going to be an examination of the incendiary diaries of the legendary CIA agent and agent provocateur E. Howard Hunt.
[03:39:41.106 --> 03:39:42.907]  It was InfoWars and Alex
[03:39:42.927 --> 03:40:11.683]  Alex Jones, who broke the story of the deathbed confessions of Hunt, who said and told InfoWars that he was on the ground in Dallas, that the operation in Dealey Plaza was indeed a CIA operation, that General Edwin Lansdale of the CIA was present, and yes, my favorite, LBJ, he said, was running the show.
[03:40:12.603 --> 03:40:16.326]  We'll have more on that in InfoWars down the road.
[03:40:17.006 --> 03:40:21.209]  Now, we are going to be taking your calls here shortly.
[03:40:21.390 --> 03:40:22.190]  Again, the number 888-201-2244.
[03:40:22.210 --> 03:40:27.454]  But before we get to that, I want to mention something that Alex Jones pointed out.
[03:40:34.279 --> 03:40:43.347]  We don't have wealthy billionaires standing in the wings ready to write giant checks to underwrite our fight against the globalists.
[03:40:44.168 --> 03:40:54.457]  We don't have a George Soros or a Rockefeller Foundation or a Ford Foundation or any of these extremely well-heeled operations.
[03:40:54.937 --> 03:40:57.179]  We have to depend on you.
[03:40:57.440 --> 03:40:59.561]  And we can only depend on you.
[03:41:00.382 --> 03:41:12.246]  That's why it's crucial you go to the Infowars.com store where Silver Bullet, the incredible colloidal silver product, is now on sale for 50% off.
[03:41:12.827 --> 03:41:18.049]  I don't know how Alex Jones slashes these prices and does it successfully.
[03:41:18.209 --> 03:41:23.991]  I guess it means we can move more product, more volume, but that is what is paying.
[03:41:24.551 --> 03:41:26.852]  For this beautiful new studio.
[03:41:27.192 --> 03:41:31.895]  That is what's paying for our expanded programming on The War Room.
[03:41:32.215 --> 03:41:43.741]  It's only because patriots like you have stepped forward and gotten some of the very best all-natural products you can find anywhere in the market today.
[03:41:44.041 --> 03:41:47.122]  But when you help yourself, you help us.
[03:41:47.563 --> 03:41:52.425]  Now, I particularly like the t-shirts, the First Amendment-oriented t-shirts.
[03:41:53.005 --> 03:41:53.746]  And let me say this.
[03:41:54.406 --> 03:42:06.274]  When I speak around the country, when I spoke in Salt Lake City this weekend, at least three people showed up wearing their classic Bill Clinton rape t-shirts.
[03:42:06.354 --> 03:42:12.158]  Now, this t-shirt is still available at the Infowars.com store, but not for much longer.
[03:42:12.798 --> 03:42:15.400]  This piece is going to end up in the Smithsonian, folks.
[03:42:15.800 --> 03:42:17.101]  Get it while you can.
[03:42:17.181 --> 03:42:20.724]  When these run out, there will be no more.
[03:42:21.264 --> 03:42:29.267]  I want to see him out there as I travel the country and I speak because it's a way of identifying like-minded patriots.
[03:42:29.687 --> 03:42:32.368]  So folks, go to theinfowars.com store.
[03:42:32.848 --> 03:42:34.448]  Give us your support.
[03:42:34.548 --> 03:42:36.609]  We will give you the truth.
[03:42:36.989 --> 03:42:43.831]  We will continue to expose the upcoming coup d'etat against our president, Donald Trump.
[03:42:44.292 --> 03:42:45.592]  I've been to Washington.
[03:42:46.072 --> 03:42:47.753]  I know what they have planned.
[03:42:48.093 --> 03:42:48.713]  Stay with us.
[03:42:48.973 --> 03:42:54.462]  We're going to be laying it all out for you on the Alex Jones Show and later at the War Room.
[03:43:03.095 --> 03:43:12.918]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[03:43:13.759 --> 03:43:23.122]  And today we see the leftists, the globalists, controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[03:43:23.522 --> 03:43:26.483]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[03:43:27.083 --> 03:43:36.777]  Clothing is a statement, and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud, just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[03:43:37.238 --> 03:43:42.445]  So right now, folks, we're gonna debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the InfoWars store.
[03:43:43.507 --> 03:43:45.228]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[03:43:45.289 --> 03:43:46.230]  It's a limited edition.
[03:43:46.790 --> 03:43:48.772]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[03:43:49.013 --> 03:43:55.760]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[03:43:56.081 --> 03:44:00.265]  On the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[03:44:00.506 --> 03:44:02.007]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows
[03:44:02.568 --> 03:44:02.948]  We're good to go.
[03:44:24.059 --> 03:44:24.660]  Says it all.
[03:44:24.780 --> 03:44:25.641]  Need I say more?
[03:44:26.162 --> 03:44:27.763]  You want to have a political message out there?
[03:44:27.803 --> 03:44:33.570]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:36.974]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[03:44:37.434 --> 03:44:43.020]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[03:44:43.721 --> 03:44:46.064]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[03:44:46.385 --> 03:44:54.776]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[03:44:55.037 --> 03:44:58.601]  And this shirt, The Spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[03:44:59.422 --> 03:45:08.889]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Labe or Come and Take It in good old-fashioned English t-shirts.
[03:45:09.049 --> 03:45:11.531]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[03:45:11.911 --> 03:45:12.992]  InfoWars.com.
[03:45:13.012 --> 03:45:13.533]  Spread the word.
[03:45:14.273 --> 03:45:15.374]  I designed this baby.
[03:45:15.454 --> 03:45:17.876]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[03:45:18.276 --> 03:45:22.519]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:45:22.920 --> 03:45:26.763]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[03:45:27.163 --> 03:45:29.865]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[03:45:29.885 --> 03:45:31.286]  It's been around about 19 years.
[03:45:31.906 --> 03:45:35.489]  It's the classic InfoWars tyranny response team shirt.
[03:45:35.769 --> 03:45:38.872]  And of course we've seen the NFL taking a knee
[03:45:39.772 --> 03:45:43.373]  Uh, daring the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[03:45:44.093 --> 03:45:44.974]  That's disrespectful.
[03:45:44.994 --> 03:45:49.015]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[03:45:49.075 --> 03:45:56.497]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[03:45:56.937 --> 03:45:58.398]  Our republic is in distress.
[03:45:58.838 --> 03:45:59.338]  Ask me why.
[03:45:59.978 --> 03:46:01.900]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[03:46:02.060 --> 03:46:07.586]  Good old camouflage with the Dayglo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[03:46:08.046 --> 03:46:09.548]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[03:46:09.608 --> 03:46:12.570]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go out and put another shirt on.
[03:46:13.031 --> 03:46:15.193]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[03:46:15.814 --> 03:46:18.056]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[03:46:18.755 --> 03:46:19.536]  It's all about freedom.
[03:46:19.576 --> 03:46:20.917]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[03:46:21.458 --> 03:46:22.359]  Resist Tyranny.
[03:46:23.020 --> 03:46:24.001]  Made in America.
[03:46:24.021 --> 03:46:24.001]  1776.
[03:46:24.522 --> 03:46:27.725]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[03:46:27.945 --> 03:46:28.906]  The backs are really cool.
[03:46:29.267 --> 03:46:29.948]  Look at that back.
[03:46:29.988 --> 03:46:30.909]  That is pure Americana.
[03:46:32.136 --> 03:46:37.278]  And I almost forgot, we've got dozens and dozens of great limited-edition ball caps available.
[03:46:37.398 --> 03:46:38.098]  The Dayglo.
[03:46:38.578 --> 03:46:42.720]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[03:46:42.840 --> 03:46:44.461]  This is my favorite ball cap.
[03:46:44.841 --> 03:46:46.161]  Over 20 ball caps we've put out.
[03:46:46.181 --> 03:46:47.462]  It's got the nice patch.
[03:46:47.782 --> 03:46:48.822]  Infowars.com.
[03:46:49.062 --> 03:46:49.943]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[03:46:50.183 --> 03:46:53.624]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[03:46:54.024 --> 03:46:55.625]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[03:46:55.865 --> 03:47:00.707]  Thank you all for your support and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:47:05.020 --> 03:47:07.622]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:33.926 --> 03:47:35.047]  And here we go.
[03:47:35.407 --> 03:47:41.790]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for my compatriot and comrade Alex Jones.
[03:47:41.850 --> 03:47:43.471]  We're in the foxhole together.
[03:47:43.491 --> 03:47:59.859]  You know, in a war against the globalists, make no bones about it, those who opposed Donald Trump in the last election, those who thought his election incredibly improbable, are committed to removing him from public office.
[03:48:00.239 --> 03:48:03.541]  But we here at InfoWars, we're not going to let that happen.
[03:48:03.621 --> 03:48:03.901]  I think.
[03:48:25.126 --> 03:48:29.227]  At Stone Cold Truth on Twitter, still follow my exploits.
[03:48:30.107 --> 03:48:37.069]  And although I don't control that site, you can keep up with my activities if you go there.
[03:48:37.089 --> 03:48:42.051]  And you can also catch up with what I'm doing on the Info Wars.
[03:48:43.011 --> 03:48:43.792]  Twitter feed.
[03:48:43.872 --> 03:48:57.583]  So I invite you to go to both and there's a petition up at Stone Cold Truth to the Twitter mavens demanding the improbable reinstatement.
[03:48:57.823 --> 03:49:00.525]  I will see these folks in court.
[03:49:00.585 --> 03:49:06.890]  You see, it's time for Twitter to be regulated like a utility and we will push
[03:49:07.350 --> 03:49:11.173]  Until our First Amendment rights are protected.
[03:49:11.253 --> 03:49:13.775]  Now, let's go to your phone calls.
[03:49:14.155 --> 03:49:18.238]  My favorite part of the show, Robert in Washington.
[03:49:18.339 --> 03:49:19.539]  What's on your mind?
[03:49:22.302 --> 03:49:23.503]  Roger, how are you today?
[03:49:23.683 --> 03:49:24.183]  Terrific.
[03:49:25.984 --> 03:49:34.311]  So, my thing is, and I see what's going on with November 4th, I've been trying to tell a lot of my friends and family
[03:49:34.986 --> 03:49:36.086]  Prepare for something.
[03:49:36.146 --> 03:49:38.387]  Worst case scenario, something doesn't happen.
[03:49:39.107 --> 03:49:42.808]  What if this is just another way to discredit the alt media?
[03:49:42.828 --> 03:49:46.049]  You guys prepare for something big.
[03:49:46.129 --> 03:49:46.990]  Nothing happens.
[03:49:47.010 --> 03:49:54.652]  They come back and say, ha, look at another, you know, lie that they tried to portray on the news and get everybody to believe.
[03:49:55.868 --> 03:50:10.427]  Well, I must tell you, I think that is unlikely because what I found out yesterday is that this agate prop that they have planned for the streets, that they are ginning up with their Tom Steyer paid-for TV commercials with their
[03:50:10.948 --> 03:50:14.011]  Soros financed full-page newspaper ads.
[03:50:14.452 --> 03:50:17.094]  That's just one part of the plot.
[03:50:17.335 --> 03:50:23.641]  This is part and parcel of an effort to try to invoke the 25th Amendment.
[03:50:23.681 --> 03:50:28.125]  Now, under the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, if a majority
[03:50:28.826 --> 03:50:29.127]  Of course.
[03:50:43.643 --> 03:50:47.806]  Now the President can appeal that question to the U.S.
[03:50:47.886 --> 03:50:58.873]  House of Representatives, but why do we think the RINOs who control the House Republican Caucus would be of a mind to keep Donald Trump in place?
[03:50:59.454 --> 03:51:13.483]  We're going to be outlining this whole nefarious plot this week on InfoWars, but I see a political synergy here where the street operations paid for by Steyer and
[03:51:14.183 --> 03:51:29.851]  Soros and others jibe with the maneuverings of Jeb Bush and Ben Sasse and others in Washington who are attempting to engineer this 25th Amendment coup.
[03:51:30.391 --> 03:51:42.157]  I can report definitively here on InfoWars private meetings between Senator Sasse and Vice President Pence very, very recently.
[03:51:42.637 --> 03:51:45.558]  What was that meeting about, Senator?
[03:51:46.638 --> 03:51:50.239]  Let's go to Debra in California.
[03:51:50.299 --> 03:51:53.379]  Debra, what's your question for InfoWars today?
[03:51:54.740 --> 03:52:04.122]  My question is, isn't it almost treason to put out that ad in the New York Times that said we're trying to take the government down?
[03:52:05.199 --> 03:52:09.445]  Well, that's the great thing about our Constitution and the First Amendment.
[03:52:09.565 --> 03:52:14.451]  Although they don't respect it at Twitter, we do respect it here at InfoWars.
[03:52:14.471 --> 03:52:16.033]  You see, I'm against censorship.
[03:52:16.634 --> 03:52:21.160]  I don't care if you're the looniest, most whacked-out left-winger in the world.
[03:52:22.121 --> 03:52:34.085]  Other than physical threats of violence, threats to kill my wife and my family and my dogs, pretty much everything else, in my view, is fairly protected speech.
[03:52:34.205 --> 03:52:36.045]  But I do agree with you in this sense.
[03:52:36.725 --> 03:52:38.546]  They have shown their hand.
[03:52:39.666 --> 03:52:42.368]  And these are interrelated operations.
[03:52:42.408 --> 03:52:47.451]  This is not some street rabble paid for by George Soros.
[03:52:47.871 --> 03:53:02.860]  They are working with members of the political establishment, both Republican and Democrat, at the highest levels to attempt to achieve what they could not achieve at the balance box, which is the removal of our president.
[03:53:03.760 --> 03:53:05.681]  Thank you very much for your call.
[03:53:06.041 --> 03:53:09.763]  Now let's go to Jude in Cincinnati.
[03:53:10.644 --> 03:53:12.625]  Jude, don't bring me down.
[03:53:12.725 --> 03:53:13.985]  What is your question?
[03:53:15.266 --> 03:53:15.926]  I get that.
[03:53:16.326 --> 03:53:17.527]  I bet you do.
[03:53:18.468 --> 03:53:31.074]  So a big story that I've been personally researching and thinking that isn't fairly covered and kind of ties everything in is really Hillary dating back when she became Secretary of State.
[03:53:31.941 --> 03:53:37.125]  Um, she was taking a lot of money into her foundation from even like Qatar.
[03:53:37.425 --> 03:53:50.514]  And then when Libya happened, you know, that whole thing with Gaddafi, we know, you know, Benghazi turned into the real story, but it was really, she was allowing Qatar to fund rebel groups in this country.
[03:53:51.154 --> 03:53:57.478]  And then that broke out sort of into Syria because then they were funneling those fighters.
[03:53:57.498 --> 03:53:59.740]  They're basically mercenaries, CIA's training them.
[03:54:00.385 --> 03:54:01.146]  To Syria.
[03:54:01.426 --> 03:54:06.531]  And like the guy that was on previously saying, you know, these guys, they're either Sharia or not.
[03:54:07.131 --> 03:54:08.352]  They're committing jihad.
[03:54:08.773 --> 03:54:14.398]  A lot of these people that they were training committed jihad in Syria, created this huge refugee crisis.
[03:54:15.339 --> 03:54:22.345]  And the people that hate nationalism that really led to the nationalist movements, that refugee crisis.
[03:54:23.598 --> 03:54:31.343]  Well, you raise a good point, and I guess I would say if you want to know what's going to happen, watch what happened in Ukraine very carefully.
[03:54:31.923 --> 03:54:52.077]  Because what happened there is that the billionaire globalist Victor Pinchuk paid the Clinton Foundation so much money that he was allowed to mount a neo-Nazi coup, overturning the democratically elected government of Ukraine.
[03:54:53.117 --> 03:55:06.726]  And it's interesting that their slogan, Blood and Soil, pops up as the slogan, allegedly, of the Antifa antis in Charlottesville.
[03:55:07.026 --> 03:55:07.626]  Coincidence?
[03:55:09.127 --> 03:55:09.427]  Not.
[03:55:09.607 --> 03:55:15.449]  It is exactly the same kind of coup that they have in mind here in the United States.
[03:55:15.969 --> 03:55:19.330]  Bill and Hillary Clinton are traitors.
[03:55:19.631 --> 03:55:22.271]  They worship the almighty dollar.
[03:55:22.712 --> 03:55:23.772]  They are not liberals.
[03:55:23.832 --> 03:55:25.032]  They are not progressives.
[03:55:25.092 --> 03:55:26.673]  They're not even globalists.
[03:55:27.253 --> 03:55:33.897]  They are just greedy criminals, and you could purchase from them virtually anything.
[03:55:34.417 --> 03:55:46.324]  In this case, the United States government agreed to look the other way while a violent coup was mounted against the democratically elected government of Ukraine.
[03:55:46.805 --> 03:55:47.465]  That is what?
[03:55:47.625 --> 03:55:50.727]  They have in mind here in the United States.
[03:56:19.068 --> 03:56:22.193]  Yes, I just wanted to talk about the JFK files.
[03:56:22.554 --> 03:56:28.665]  Y'all keep saying that Trump's released them all, and he's only released the files associated with JFK's assassination.
[03:56:31.052 --> 03:56:33.234]  Well, in fact, I'll go a step further.
[03:56:33.394 --> 03:56:51.428]  I would like to see the President go back and review the material that was already previously released under the 1992 JFK Records Act, which is far too heavily re-adapted, which means blacked out, in my opinion.
[03:56:51.548 --> 03:56:58.974]  I'd like to see him do with that material what he has just ordered be done with the more recent disclosures, which is
[03:56:59.494 --> 03:57:02.177]  Get rid of the redactions, get rid of the blackings out.
[03:57:02.397 --> 03:57:08.923]  The president came up with a very clever and I think smart response to his deep state handlers.
[03:57:09.763 --> 03:57:18.551]  He's happy to withhold any information that revolves around or regards people who are still living today.
[03:57:19.434 --> 03:57:25.419]  That is very, very, very few in terms of involvement in this data.
[03:57:25.879 --> 03:57:31.965]  So, yes, I will be calling on the President to release it all, and the sooner, the better.
[03:57:31.985 --> 03:57:38.150]  I'm Roger Stone, you're on the Alex Jones Show, and we'll be back for more of your calls.
[03:57:59.945 --> 03:58:06.989]  We're not going to stoop to the tactics of this authoritarian communist and fascist, funded by that dirtbag George Soros.
[03:58:07.089 --> 03:58:09.731]  The communists, they can't resist free stuff.
[03:58:09.751 --> 03:58:13.473]  You set up a booth, it says free stuff.
[03:58:13.753 --> 03:58:17.575]  We're going to keep our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, and the American way.
[03:58:17.595 --> 03:58:19.616]  But at the same time, we're not going to back down
[03:58:28.257 --> 03:58:30.738]  What do I do if one of these libtards calls me a Nazi?
[03:58:31.459 --> 03:58:31.939]  That's easy.
[03:58:31.959 --> 03:58:34.260]  You just put a pacifier in his mouth.
[03:58:39.422 --> 03:58:42.004]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[03:58:42.444 --> 03:58:44.065]  One of these Antipas get in my face.
[03:58:44.085 --> 03:58:49.587]  I'm gonna pull out my pocket constitution and stick it in his.
[03:58:52.949 --> 03:58:53.589]  Antipa?
[03:58:54.250 --> 03:58:54.890]  Never heard of him.
[03:58:56.546 --> 03:58:57.291]  Never heard of the guy.
[03:58:58.016 --> 03:58:59.667]  They're gonna lose on November 4th at every
