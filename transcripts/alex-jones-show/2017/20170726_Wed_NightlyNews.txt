[00:00:18.663 --> 00:00:20.626]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.746 --> 00:00:22.929]  It's Wednesday, July 26th, 2017.
[00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.732]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:24.972 --> 00:00:25.994]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.732]  Tonight, an emergency transmission from the Infowar.
[00:00:35.152 --> 00:00:37.973]  The globalists plan to overthrow the U.S.
[00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:40.754]  government and take out Donald Trump.
[00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:54.340]  Alex Jones warns the president of the impending doom our country faces if he allows traitors inside the government to plot and follow through with a political coup.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.160]  They've got the plan.
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.281]  They're getting it ready to have a coup.
[00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:59.022]  In the next 30 days, they're planning to do it.
[00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:06.947]  The feds arrest Clinton operatives trying to leave the country, but Debbie Wasserman Schultz knows nothing!
[00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:08.147]  I know nothing!
[00:01:08.247 --> 00:01:09.428]  I know nothing!
[00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:17.693]  All that plus, trigger alert, President Donald Trump announces a ban on transgenders in the U.S.
[00:01:17.893 --> 00:01:18.754]  military.
[00:01:19.154 --> 00:01:23.477]  All that plus much more, up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:35.358]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:47.404]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community, is fully aware of the fact
[00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:53.667]  That our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:01:54.387 --> 00:02:02.310]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:11.815]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:18.804]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:27.317]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:32.041]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body.
[00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:34.904]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:43.532]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:49.654]  Because of you praying for the broadcast, because of you buying the products and financially supporting the transmissions.
[00:02:49.914 --> 00:02:55.577]  So please, secure your caveman today at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:17.611]  Well, the Awan Brothers saga has reached an interesting point.
[00:03:18.312 --> 00:03:23.979]  It is a story that has mostly been covered up by mainstream news, and by covered up, I mean completely ignored.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.765]  NBC, MSNBC, CNN, they won't even touch this thing.
[00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:30.247]  New York Times, Washington Post.
[00:03:30.948 --> 00:03:38.374]  Zero on this story, and it's especially shocking when you consider the developments that we've seen over the last 48 hours.
[00:03:38.454 --> 00:03:44.218]  And reminding you that this is all with the backdrop of Trump-Russia collusion.
[00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:46.299]  Trump-Russia collusion in the news all day.
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.281]  Trump-Russia collusion on the Hill all day.
[00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:51.563]  Trump-Russia hacking, Russia hacking, all this hacking.
[00:03:51.903 --> 00:03:53.224]  So all of that's in the background.
[00:03:54.221 --> 00:04:05.567]  Meanwhile, this is all the developments that are actually going down with raw evidence while the Trump-Russia investigation has proved zero, zero at all corruption with Trump and Russia.
[00:04:05.968 --> 00:04:11.551]  But let me give you a gestalt of everything that is broken down with this Wan Brothers saga and where we are now.
[00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:24.063]  It starts with, and this is kind of what got the new series started in motion, FBI seized smashed hard drives from Wasserman Schultz IT Aides home.
[00:04:24.684 --> 00:04:27.105]  Now this presents a series of questions.
[00:04:28.065 --> 00:04:31.667]  One, of course, why are they smashing hard drives?
[00:04:32.968 --> 00:04:36.549]  You have to wonder why they're all smashing their hard drives.
[00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:38.210]  No one will ask that question.
[00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.951]  They won't give you a legit answer.
[00:04:40.371 --> 00:04:41.592]  But you also have to wonder,
[00:04:42.577 --> 00:04:56.202]  Considering the DNC and Wasserman Schultz have not cooperated with people trying to get their servers to investigate them onto whether it was Russia that hacked them or not, are these the servers that Russia allegedly hacked?
[00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:58.343]  And if so, why would they smash them?
[00:04:58.663 --> 00:05:00.364]  Perhaps to hide evidence.
[00:05:00.764 --> 00:05:10.248]  So Wasserman Schultz, who's pretended like she's not in the wrong in this whole thing, nobody's talking about her, well, she has her smashed hard drive seized by the FBI.
[00:05:11.431 --> 00:05:14.515]  And again, you have to ask, where is the DNC's server?
[00:05:14.836 --> 00:05:17.479]  The DNC has refused to cooperate with the FBI.
[00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:20.203]  The DNC has refused to turn over their server.
[00:05:20.443 --> 00:05:27.092]  We're just supposed to take their word for it from someone that they hired, that it was Russia that hacked their server.
[00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:33.977]  Well, why did you smash it up then, and why isn't that being treated like a situation that would be obstruction of justice?
[00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:46.747]  If it was Trump that did it, you know they would be crying obstruction with justice, but Debbie Wasserman Schultz gets to smash her servers, doesn't cooperate with the FBI, won't turn over the server, and we're supposed to believe it was Russia.
[00:05:47.027 --> 00:05:52.291]  Oh, and by the way, on the Hill today, again, they're not talking about this on the Hill, on the Hill today,
[00:05:53.132 --> 00:06:00.198]  Then another hearing talking about foreign relations and what this means and how this needs to be treated inside the U.S.
[00:06:00.218 --> 00:06:03.000]  They're not going through the proper protocols and
[00:06:04.542 --> 00:06:10.226]  Feinstein said this, she said, Americans should and do feel invaded.
[00:06:10.246 --> 00:06:13.088]  21 states elections were pierced.
[00:06:13.628 --> 00:06:17.071]  And then she said, we believe by Russia.
[00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.052]  They don't even know it.
[00:06:19.292 --> 00:06:23.475]  They will never know it because you can't know something that isn't true.
[00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:27.198]  But let's get back to Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:33.753]  House hacking suspects could read every email dozens of congressmen sent and received.
[00:06:34.014 --> 00:06:38.216]  So you've got the Awan brothers on the IT staff for dozens of Democrat staffers.
[00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:45.739]  They have access to all of their email and who knows what else, considering they're IT savvy, what else that they could have access to.
[00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:51.121]  So then you go on to think, it goes on to talk about hacking in this story.
[00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.094]  Maybe it was the Awans that hacked the DNC.
[00:06:56.515 --> 00:06:59.799]  Maybe it was the Awans that were sharing classified information.
[00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:07.769]  Maybe, who knows, it could have been the Awans that shared information that ended up having the first Navy SEAL operation under Trump ambushed.
[00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:10.112]  Something that never happens to Navy SEALs.
[00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:14.364]  But nobody's talking about the fact that the Iwans had all that access.
[00:07:14.384 --> 00:07:16.866]  They keep talking about Russia with zero proof.
[00:07:17.627 --> 00:07:20.089]  Wasserman Schultz, and this is when it got really interesting.
[00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:29.138]  Wasserman Schultz, ITA, arrested at airport after transferring $300,000 to Pakistan from house office.
[00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:36.545]  Now there's going to be all sorts of weird stuff that emerges with the Iwan brothers, their different houses, where they were working, and how much money they received.
[00:07:37.622 --> 00:07:39.803]  But the story was that they were trying to flee the country.
[00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:41.103]  They're fighting that narrative.
[00:07:41.123 --> 00:07:42.403]  We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:07:42.743 --> 00:07:44.444]  But they were finally arrested!
[00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:47.945]  People have been calling for their arrest for a very long time.
[00:07:48.205 --> 00:07:49.345]  They finally get arrested.
[00:07:49.365 --> 00:07:52.526]  I'm wondering what was the link that led to that arrest.
[00:07:52.746 --> 00:07:54.426]  We'll get to that in a second.
[00:07:54.846 --> 00:07:56.727]  But let's get back to Washerman Schultz.
[00:07:57.327 --> 00:07:58.187]  Now, let's recall.
[00:07:58.227 --> 00:07:59.968]  This is from a few months back.
[00:08:00.348 --> 00:08:05.250]  Washerman Schultz threatens police chief for gathering evidence on her I.T.
[00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.490]  staffers alleged crimes.
[00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.531]  That'd be a one who just got arrested.
[00:08:08.971 --> 00:08:12.832]  Let's listen to Washerman Schultz, clearly afraid of justice in this clip.
[00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:20.312]  If the member loses the equipment, says they lose the equipment, and it is found by the Capitol Police... Lose the equipment!
[00:08:20.372 --> 00:08:20.932]  Keep that in mind!
[00:08:20.952 --> 00:08:21.933]  It is supposed to be returned.
[00:08:22.033 --> 00:08:22.993]  Lose the equipment!
[00:08:23.113 --> 00:08:25.493]  Ownership has been established, it will be returned.
[00:08:26.654 --> 00:08:27.634]  Lose the equipment!
[00:08:27.714 --> 00:08:32.175]  We're talking about her losing the equipment, and we're worried about Russia?
[00:08:32.275 --> 00:08:33.995]  She can't even keep track of her own equipment?
[00:08:34.495 --> 00:08:42.677]  If the equipment belongs to the member, it has been lost, they say it's been lost, and it's been identified as that member's, and the Capitol Police is supposed to return it.
[00:08:43.237 --> 00:08:43.497]  Correct.
[00:08:43.537 --> 00:08:52.102]  Now she's here begging the Capitol Police for this, I guess, computers or laptops or hard drives back, because she knows there's damning evidence on there.
[00:08:52.322 --> 00:08:56.485]  So she's begging the police chief, give it to me back, trying to intimidate him, threaten him.
[00:08:56.525 --> 00:09:02.128]  It is identified as that member's equipment, and the member is not associated with any case.
[00:09:02.969 --> 00:09:06.551]  Folks, if you can't see that woman's pure evil just by looking at her, I mean, my gosh.
[00:09:08.594 --> 00:09:10.796]  I don't understand how that's possible.
[00:09:11.356 --> 00:09:13.758]  Members' equipment is members' equipment.
[00:09:13.858 --> 00:09:19.623]  It is not... You are watching film of Debbie Wasserman Schultz trying to evade justice.
[00:09:20.064 --> 00:09:23.547]  ...members' equipment when the member is not under investigation.
[00:09:24.328 --> 00:09:26.029]  Oh, not under investigation.
[00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.390]  Now they're arrested.
[00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:34.657]  Well, I think there's extenuating circumstances in this case and I think that working through my counsel and
[00:09:35.237 --> 00:09:35.397]  Wow!
[00:09:35.417 --> 00:09:40.401]  Washerman Schultz has the nerve to tell the Capitol Police Chief that there will be consequences for him and that he's violating the rules!
[00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:14.480]  The unmitigated nerve of Washerman Schultz, who's violating the rules, breaking the law, not in a position of authority, threatening the DC Police Chief.
[00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:18.044]  I'm wondering if that might be some sort of gangster mob threat.
[00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:19.546]  You know what I'm saying, folks?
[00:10:20.607 --> 00:10:23.510]  Six people mysteriously dying around the DNC fraud lawsuit.
[00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.512]  Again, another background of this whole thing.
[00:10:27.074 --> 00:10:27.854]  Let's move on.
[00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:31.615]  So there's Wasserman Schultz threatening the Capitol Police Chief.
[00:10:31.635 --> 00:10:36.636]  That was a few months ago over evidence that they had that she wanted back.
[00:10:37.356 --> 00:10:38.517]  Of course she wanted it back.
[00:10:39.337 --> 00:10:40.897]  Probably indicts her red-handed.
[00:10:41.658 --> 00:10:42.698]  But that's not where it ends.
[00:10:42.738 --> 00:10:43.218]  Look at this.
[00:10:43.598 --> 00:10:45.378]  Wasserman Schultz, IT guy.
[00:10:45.899 --> 00:10:46.959]  Now you have a wan.
[00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:51.380]  So not just Wasserman Schultz, now you have a wan threatening people.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:11:00.689]  A former Congress informational technology aide, Awan, threatened to have his stepmother's Pakistani relatives kidnapped if she talked to U.S.
[00:11:00.709 --> 00:11:01.730]  law enforcement authorities.
[00:11:02.271 --> 00:11:06.035]  This is the quote from Iran's stepmother, Samani Galani.
[00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:14.123]  Imran Awan threatened that he is very powerful, and if I ever call the police again, he will kidnap my family members back to Pakistan.
[00:11:14.824 --> 00:11:20.390]  Imran did admit to me that my phone is tapped and there are devices installed in my house.
[00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:24.914]  She goes on to talk about how he brags in Pakistan about how he has all this power in D.C.
[00:11:25.454 --> 00:11:27.556]  Maybe that's what Wasserman Schultz is talking about.
[00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:34.543]  Maybe she's got a gangster mafia behind her that just puts people in the dirt whenever they stand up to them.
[00:11:34.583 --> 00:11:36.265]  Maybe that's what Wasserman Schultz was talking about.
[00:11:36.465 --> 00:11:40.609]  Maybe that's why Awan threatens to kidnap people for talking to authorities.
[00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:43.411]  So you have Wasserman Schultz threatening people.
[00:11:43.731 --> 00:11:45.873]  You have Awan threatening people.
[00:11:46.193 --> 00:11:47.775]  This is really incredible.
[00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:50.977]  And both of them trying to evade justice.
[00:11:51.117 --> 00:11:53.359]  And again, zero in the mainstream media.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.720]  Zero on the Hill.
[00:11:55.101 --> 00:11:57.383]  Well, you're getting something from Julian Assange.
[00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:59.745]  Let's talk about Nancy Pelosi for a second.
[00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:03.353]  So Julian Assange tweets this out.
[00:12:04.354 --> 00:12:07.556]  Wasserman Solt's IT staff are arrested trying to leave the country.
[00:12:07.937 --> 00:12:12.060]  And then he links to this WikiLeaks email that becomes all the more timely.
[00:12:12.921 --> 00:12:14.042]  This is from WikiLeaks.
[00:12:14.122 --> 00:12:16.163]  Pelosi is doing a closed-door meeting.
[00:12:16.364 --> 00:12:17.885]  No staff or anyone allowed.
[00:12:18.225 --> 00:12:19.406]  Oh, but guess who is in there?
[00:12:19.986 --> 00:12:21.267]  Imran Awan!
[00:12:21.848 --> 00:12:25.050]  And he's handling Pelosi's iPad.
[00:12:26.164 --> 00:12:33.788]  So, highly classified closed door meeting, Imran Awan somehow has access, and he is managing Nancy Pelosi's iPad.
[00:12:34.909 --> 00:12:40.572]  But, apparently, just like Washerman Schultz lost the equipment, she just lost it, the D.C.
[00:12:40.612 --> 00:12:48.596]  police found it for her, now she wants it back, I guess Nancy Pelosi doesn't know what planet she's on either, because she denies even knowing who Awan is.
[00:12:52.615 --> 00:12:53.537]  There's a story out now.
[00:12:53.597 --> 00:12:55.039]  It's been going on since February.
[00:12:55.059 --> 00:13:03.373]  You've had these IT staffers that had primarily worked for the Democrats and they're under investigation by the Capitol Hill Police.
[00:13:03.413 --> 00:13:04.776]  She still thinks Bush is president.
[00:13:04.816 --> 00:13:05.757]  She doesn't know what's going on.
[00:13:06.254 --> 00:13:07.694]  Still getting paid at this time.
[00:13:07.714 --> 00:13:09.955]  I'm really not familiar with what you're talking about.
[00:13:32.585 --> 00:13:35.847]  Well, the people who are under investigation are the Attorney General of the United States.
[00:13:35.927 --> 00:13:37.447]  I mean, what are we talking about here?
[00:13:37.948 --> 00:13:38.768]  What are we talking about?
[00:13:38.788 --> 00:13:39.528]  She has no idea.
[00:13:40.689 --> 00:13:41.869]  I'm not familiar.
[00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.711]  You have a very specific charge there.
[00:13:45.771 --> 00:13:46.832]  Yeah, you have specific things.
[00:13:46.872 --> 00:13:47.352]  I don't know specifics.
[00:13:47.372 --> 00:13:48.753]  I haven't followed that so closely.
[00:13:48.833 --> 00:13:50.574]  We've been busy with a lot of other things.
[00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:53.535]  Yeah, you've been busy looking up your butt for Russia.
[00:13:53.615 --> 00:14:01.439]  I'm not sufficiently understanding the situation to make any concern about it, but there are plenty of people who've
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:14.622]  Okay, so you've got Debbie Wasserman Schultz who just loses IT equipment.
[00:14:14.762 --> 00:14:15.603]  She can't find it.
[00:14:15.703 --> 00:14:16.643]  Capitol Police find it.
[00:14:16.663 --> 00:14:17.403]  She wants it back.
[00:14:17.723 --> 00:14:19.024]  No, they tried to ditch the equipment.
[00:14:19.064 --> 00:14:20.024]  That's the honest truth.
[00:14:20.504 --> 00:14:26.886]  And then you have Nancy Pelosi who you have Imran Awan in closed meeting, top secret meetings, handling her iPad.
[00:14:27.566 --> 00:14:28.807]  Yeah, she doesn't know who it is.
[00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:30.327]  She's never heard of this investigation.
[00:14:30.387 --> 00:14:31.348]  She doesn't know anything.
[00:14:31.408 --> 00:14:32.768]  She's completely clueless on that.
[00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:40.952]  So, you either have Wasserman Soltz and Nancy Pelosi completely lying to you, or you have two completely incompetent people in Congress.
[00:14:41.192 --> 00:14:44.074]  And I think the truth of the matter is that both are true.
[00:14:44.694 --> 00:14:46.415]  But this is nothing new for Nancy Pelosi.
[00:14:46.435 --> 00:14:48.136]  Let's recall that Nancy Pelosi
[00:14:49.156 --> 00:14:58.222]  gave Jonathan Gruber a big shout-out in 2009, and then when it was brought to her attention what Jonathan Gruber was saying about the American people, she denied knowing Jonathan Gruber.
[00:14:58.242 --> 00:15:02.244]  So, no surprising news there that Nancy Pelosi is a complete two-faced liar.
[00:15:02.645 --> 00:15:12.471]  It's just worth, again, pounding that point home when we're talking about people listening to her about Russia and collusion, and then her trying to evade anybody talking about the Iwan brothers.
[00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:13.892]  You know exactly why.
[00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:15.973]  Now here's your collusion, folks.
[00:15:16.133 --> 00:15:18.534]  This is when the real collusion starts to take place.
[00:15:19.095 --> 00:15:22.757]  Imran Awan's lawyer is longtime Clinton associate.
[00:15:23.877 --> 00:15:24.497]  Shocking, right?
[00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:27.338]  I know, you would never have expected that.
[00:15:27.358 --> 00:15:29.459]  Now you've got collusion with the Clintons in there.
[00:15:29.719 --> 00:15:33.241]  You've got Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who rigged the election for Hillary Clinton.
[00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:35.262]  That's what they're trying to cover up right now.
[00:15:35.322 --> 00:15:36.242]  They don't want to go to jail.
[00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:40.224]  Wasserman Schultz knows that she rigged it for Clinton, and we'll even have more on that.
[00:15:41.164 --> 00:15:45.006]  So now you have Clinton's lawyers trying to stand up for Awan.
[00:15:45.506 --> 00:15:52.049]  This is really an incredible email, or excuse me, statement released today from Clinton's lawyer, excuse me, Awan's lawyer.
[00:15:52.409 --> 00:15:59.017]  The attacks on Mr. Awan and his family begin as a part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the heart of our democracy.
[00:15:59.357 --> 00:16:00.839]  Okay, so what happened on 9-11?
[00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:04.203]  Again, you know, I'm still waiting to hear these people say that it's Muslim bigotry.
[00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:05.304]  Well, what happened on 9-11?
[00:16:05.605 --> 00:16:09.069]  Did Muslims who hate our way of life kill 3,000 people, or is that fake news?
[00:16:09.089 --> 00:16:10.010]  You're yet to address that.
[00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.291]  But let's move on.
[00:16:12.421 --> 00:16:23.524]  House of Representatives for months have been utterly unsupported, outlandish, slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming out not just from the ultra-right-wing Pizzagate media, but from sitting members of Congress.
[00:16:25.104 --> 00:16:29.305]  I'm not the one that talked about a pizza-related map in the WikiLeaks emails, okay?
[00:16:29.345 --> 00:16:30.205]  So you might want to check that.
[00:16:30.545 --> 00:16:33.706]  Mr. Awan's family is presently staying with extended family in Pakistan.
[00:16:34.006 --> 00:16:38.227]  This is key, because his wife and him were both abruptly and unjustly fired
[00:16:38.627 --> 00:16:46.193]  Leaving them without a reliable source of income to pay their living expenses, and because extremists, right-wing belongers, were beginning to harass them and their children.
[00:16:46.513 --> 00:16:48.114]  I've seen no stories of that until now.
[00:16:48.154 --> 00:16:50.716]  You'd think the left would be going over that, going crazy.
[00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:52.618]  No.
[00:16:52.998 --> 00:16:58.542]  And then he says he's been staying in the Midwest, or in the U.S., but now he's going overseas to see his family.
[00:16:59.505 --> 00:17:02.626]  He wasn't trying to flee, but we're confident in the integrity of the U.S.
[00:17:02.646 --> 00:17:03.186]  justicism.
[00:17:03.506 --> 00:17:13.127]  No, you're confident that the Clinton crime syndicate, Clinton mafia boss is going to put anyone six feet under who's getting in the way of you absconding justice.
[00:17:13.427 --> 00:17:14.628]  That's what they're saying.
[00:17:14.948 --> 00:17:16.588]  That's what Wasserman Schultz is saying.
[00:17:16.988 --> 00:17:21.989]  But keep in mind, he says that Awan couldn't make ends meet.
[00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:25.389]  He was struggling to pay his daily living expenses.
[00:17:25.409 --> 00:17:26.009]  He didn't know what to do.
[00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.670]  He was fired.
[00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.570]  How is that possible?
[00:17:29.775 --> 00:17:37.401]  Pakistani suspects in a House IT probe received four million dollars representing Democrats.
[00:17:37.841 --> 00:17:45.968]  So the Awans have made millions and millions and millions of dollars working for Wasserman Schultz, working for the Democrats.
[00:17:46.428 --> 00:17:50.892]  And they were still employed just a month ago, so still making high dollars.
[00:17:51.293 --> 00:18:05.886]  Oh, but magically, all of a sudden they're under investigation, all of a sudden the FBI wants to investigate, all of a sudden they're going to get arrested, and now they can't make ends meet, now they're financially struggling, even though they've made millions over the last ten years.
[00:18:06.326 --> 00:18:08.789]  So you know that the lawyer probably isn't being fully honest on that.
[00:18:09.109 --> 00:18:10.410]  But despite all of this evidence,
[00:18:11.411 --> 00:18:27.019]  Despite all of this evidence with the Iwans and the Clintons and Washerman Schultz and the DNC fraud lawsuit and Bernie Sanders supporters being upset and all the money and the lies that they told you, Clinton is about to release a new book doubling down on Russia and blaming James Comey.
[00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:28.800]  So these people cannot face the truth.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.001]  But this is going to shock you, but not shock you.
[00:18:31.601 --> 00:18:33.381]  This is from the Florida Bulldog.
[00:18:33.641 --> 00:18:37.762]  The DNC claims it's not obligated to follow its own rules.
[00:18:38.022 --> 00:18:46.064]  DNC lawyer, his name is Spiva, has said that they determine who gets nominated, not the people.
[00:18:46.544 --> 00:18:47.605]  So they're admitting it, folks!
[00:18:48.285 --> 00:18:50.485]  The Democrats stole the election from Sanders.
[00:18:50.605 --> 00:18:51.886]  It was rigged the whole time.
[00:18:52.286 --> 00:18:57.527]  Now they're trying to cover all of it up and abscond with the evidence, smash servers, and ignore the truth.
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.840]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy!
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:10.447 --> 00:23:15.690]  This is no longer about Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals.
[00:23:16.251 --> 00:23:26.617]  This is about a full-on assault by the left, the Democratic Party, to absolutely carry out a coup d'etat against President Trump.
[00:23:26.877 --> 00:23:31.298]  I'd like to think that Mr. Trump and other people in the White House would like to get this behind us.
[00:23:31.318 --> 00:23:34.518]  The best way to do that is to have as much transparency as possible.
[00:23:34.659 --> 00:23:36.619]  If there's nothing to hide there,
[00:23:52.802 --> 00:23:58.163]  Then they should cooperate fully and in an accelerated fashion with the special counsel and others.
[00:23:58.723 --> 00:24:06.645]  But I think time after time after time, one only comes away with the impression that there is a resistance to having more information come out.
[00:24:07.225 --> 00:24:08.445]  And that just feeds suspicions.
[00:24:08.485 --> 00:24:14.766]  And I do think, I'm hoping that this is going to be addressed sooner rather than later in terms of what is there.
[00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:16.267]  If there's nothing there, let's move on.
[00:24:16.807 --> 00:24:21.928]  But this is where the work of Robert Mueller is critical to our future as a country, because
[00:24:23.028 --> 00:24:25.270]  In some respects, we're a government and a nation in crisis right now.
[00:24:25.671 --> 00:24:30.074]  I really hope that our members of Congress, our elected representatives, are going to stand up and say enough is enough.
[00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:37.781]  And stop making apologies and excuses for things that are happening that really flout, I think, our system of laws and government here.
[00:24:38.021 --> 00:24:50.872]  When you say enough is enough, if he's fired, and he's the President of the United States, he could tell Rosenstein to fire him if he wants, but if he's fired, what would you want Congress to do?
[00:24:52.230 --> 00:25:00.952]  First of all, I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse to carry out some of these orders that, again, are inconsistent with what this country is all about.
[00:25:01.952 --> 00:25:07.553]  But I would just hope that this is not going to be a partisan issue.
[00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:15.375]  That Republicans and Democrats are going to see that the future of this country is at stake, and there needs to be some things done for the good of the future.
[00:25:15.495 --> 00:25:15.795]  Really?
[00:25:16.155 --> 00:25:18.958]  Are we to be lectured by Brennan and Clapper?
[00:25:19.118 --> 00:25:22.361]  Two stooges that stabbed America in the back?
[00:25:22.642 --> 00:25:26.666]  Our enemy is not terrorism because terrorism is but a tactic.
[00:25:27.546 --> 00:25:31.090]  Our enemy is not terror because terror is a state of mind.
[00:25:31.711 --> 00:25:34.634]  And as Americans, we refuse to live in fear.
[00:25:35.888 --> 00:25:45.660]  Nor do we describe our enemy as jihadists or Islamists, because jihad is a holy struggle, a legitimate tenet of Islam, meaning to purify oneself of one's community.
[00:25:46.001 --> 00:25:53.591]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.420]  No, sir.
[00:25:56.161 --> 00:26:00.424]  Meanwhile, Representative Gutierrez, leading proponent of the U.N.'
[00:26:00.404 --> 00:26:10.731]  's genocidal replacement migration plan in North America, fires up his regressive supporters from his half-baked platform of cognitive dissonance.
[00:26:11.551 --> 00:26:20.438]  The millions of undocumented workers that work every day, sweat and toil at some of the most miserable jobs in the United States of America are not criminals.
[00:26:21.596 --> 00:26:25.340]  We are going to determine and history is going to determine who those criminals are.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:31.506]  And for me, the major criminal that exists in the United States of America is called Donald Trump.
[00:26:31.706 --> 00:26:34.990]  He lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House.
[00:26:38.137 --> 00:26:58.733]  And we're going to take actions today, and we're going to take actions tomorrow, and there will soon be a majority in the House of Representatives, and I'm going to make sure that I'm there to make sure of one thing, that we write those articles of impeachment and take them to trial before the Senate, and eliminate him as President of the United States of America.
[00:27:00.287 --> 00:27:10.153]  This from a politician that was recently reported to have siphoned off $400,000 in campaign funds to his wife for alleged personal use.
[00:27:10.413 --> 00:27:15.357]  George Orwell wrote, Who controls the past, controls the future.
[00:27:15.537 --> 00:27:18.799]  Who controls the present, controls the past.
[00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:30.530]  As Americans become more aware of the criminal desperation of the left in their midst, Obama's henchmen are clearly losing their grasp on that propaganda formula.
[00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.613]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.020]  Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:53.448]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com and today President Trump came out and made an announcement reversing Obama's transgendered allowance into the military, whatever you want to call it, saying, hey, our military is a fighting force.
[00:27:53.928 --> 00:27:55.669]  We're not here to do any of this PCBS.
[00:27:55.689 --> 00:27:57.110]  We are not a social experiment.
[00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:03.453]  We are here to do one thing and one thing only, to put rounds downrange, put steel on target, put two to the chest, one to the head.
[00:28:04.553 --> 00:28:05.194]  That's what we do.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.102]  And that's what it's all about and that's why you join.
[00:28:08.362 --> 00:28:13.926]  You see the passion, the fire, the intensity in each and every single soldier that sets foot into combat.
[00:28:14.547 --> 00:28:21.513]  I don't want someone named Tom that wants to be Tommy sitting beside me in the foxhole going, I just don't really know if I'm quite ready for this yet.
[00:28:21.573 --> 00:28:25.836]  I should be doing something else like being a beauty pageant or playing with Barbie dolls.
[00:28:26.096 --> 00:28:26.417]  No!
[00:28:26.797 --> 00:28:27.197]  Get on the 50 Cal!
[00:28:28.218 --> 00:28:29.319]  That's what we want.
[00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:30.879]  We want manly men.
[00:28:31.179 --> 00:28:32.580]  We want alpha females.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:41.123]  We want people who got their mind right, they're ready to go train, PT their asses off, get chiseled, get a buzz cut, and kick ass.
[00:28:41.723 --> 00:28:42.844]  That is what it's about.
[00:28:43.464 --> 00:28:45.745]  So none of this crap right here that's going on.
[00:28:46.005 --> 00:28:50.846]  And the LGBT community comes out today and they go, oh my God, we're being discriminated against.
[00:28:51.366 --> 00:28:52.906]  Well, let's use facts.
[00:28:53.406 --> 00:29:00.448]  There's a little website called New York Times and it says that only .6% of the adult population in America is transgender.
[00:29:00.648 --> 00:29:02.669]  That's 1.4 million Americans, everybody.
[00:29:02.989 --> 00:29:04.029]  That's not a lot of people.
[00:29:04.369 --> 00:29:07.950]  There's 2 million people or more, almost 3 million in Austin alone.
[00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.712]  So we've discriminated against a little city in Texas?
[00:29:10.732 --> 00:29:12.093]  I mean, that's what's really going on?
[00:29:12.113 --> 00:29:13.113]  Oh my God!
[00:29:13.574 --> 00:29:14.094]  Well, guess what?
[00:29:14.114 --> 00:29:16.636]  Let's use more facts from Military.com.
[00:29:16.956 --> 00:29:20.359]  80% of all people that go to join the military are turned down.
[00:29:20.679 --> 00:29:24.622]  Only 20% of walk-ins are allowed in to the fighting forces.
[00:29:25.222 --> 00:29:30.187]  So discrimination, if you want to call it that, has been going on for years, but it's not discrimination.
[00:29:30.527 --> 00:29:31.748]  We are a fighting force.
[00:29:32.109 --> 00:29:34.231]  We are not a social experiment.
[00:29:34.611 --> 00:29:48.464]  We are meant to find the biggest, the baddest, the smartest, and the craziest MFers out there, to put them behind a gun, teach them how to use it, to be proficient with it, to be tactical, to be trained well, and to be just a
[00:29:48.524 --> 00:29:55.766]  A physical specimen, a god, ready to take on anything out there to rip heads off, spit down throats, and put two to the chest and one to the head.
[00:29:56.266 --> 00:29:56.706]  That's it.
[00:29:56.766 --> 00:30:02.547]  We kick in doors, blow stuff up, fly fighter jets, go in and do what we gotta do.
[00:30:02.907 --> 00:30:05.848]  We don't have time for worrying about Tom trying to be Tommy.
[00:30:06.908 --> 00:30:07.808]  Now think about this.
[00:30:08.288 --> 00:30:10.029]  That's a small percentage of people.
[00:30:11.007 --> 00:30:14.748]  Out of that 1.4 million people, how many people rushed to the military to sign up?
[00:30:15.368 --> 00:30:16.208]  Probably not that much.
[00:30:16.929 --> 00:30:18.869]  But you know what does cost a lot out of that?
[00:30:19.189 --> 00:30:23.791]  The fact that the military was going to spend our money to do those surgeries.
[00:30:24.611 --> 00:30:26.891]  I got a better idea that we could use for that money now.
[00:30:27.072 --> 00:30:28.232]  We use it for homeless veterans.
[00:30:28.792 --> 00:30:33.494]  We use it for the veterans that have been injured in combat, protecting our freedoms.
[00:30:33.994 --> 00:30:36.035]  We help them get homes, the ones that can't get jobs.
[00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:40.116]  We help them get the medical care that they seek and need.
[00:30:40.496 --> 00:30:44.318]  We help and use it to get the VA system better.
[00:30:45.438 --> 00:30:52.721]  There's many things that can be done, but allowing transgendered people in just really isn't one of them, and I could care less.
[00:30:52.781 --> 00:30:54.082]  I don't feel bad about it at all.
[00:30:54.342 --> 00:30:57.483]  Quite frankly, I jumped up and down today and screamed and actually did a sprint.
[00:30:58.348 --> 00:30:59.049]  I was that happy.
[00:30:59.449 --> 00:31:03.932]  I promised myself when I got out of the Army I'd never run again, but I ran today because today was a great day.
[00:31:03.952 --> 00:31:04.793]  It was a momentous day.
[00:31:04.813 --> 00:31:10.778]  It was the greatest day in history to see that being reversed because we get back to where we are supposed to be.
[00:31:11.478 --> 00:31:12.599]  Fighting the enemy.
[00:31:12.919 --> 00:31:13.960]  Focusing on that.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:22.487]  Being professional and tactical and proficient in our weapon systems, in our MOS's, and getting the job done.
[00:31:23.467 --> 00:31:24.328]  And that's what it's all about.
[00:31:26.829 --> 00:31:32.393]  So, round of applause, a big HUAH for President Trump for doing the right thing.
[00:31:32.493 --> 00:31:41.779]  Thank you General Mad Dog Mattis and all those out there for actually getting us on the right track back to the fighting force that we were and will continue to be from here on out.
[00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:44.101]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:31:47.923 --> 00:31:49.825]  In a land of timeless beauty.
[00:31:51.499 --> 00:31:52.879]  He was a man of peace.
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:32:00.762]  The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I'm president and they're not.
[00:32:07.664 --> 00:32:15.026]  But when they threatened his world and the woman he loved, he was driven to war.
[00:32:25.788 --> 00:32:29.451]  If I could put chemicals in the water, they'd turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:32:29.511 --> 00:32:33.554]  Get him out of here!
[00:32:35.056 --> 00:32:35.736]  Get out!
[00:32:35.896 --> 00:32:37.017]  Go home to mommy.
[00:32:37.137 --> 00:32:37.918]  Go home.
[00:32:38.018 --> 00:32:38.378]  Bye.

[00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:41.242]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:33:41.502 --> 00:33:50.344]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:33:50.544 --> 00:33:53.765]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:03.531]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:13.575]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:24.098]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:34:32.263 --> 00:34:42.189]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.
[00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:50.995]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:34:51.335 --> 00:34:52.476]  That means it's clean.
[00:34:52.776 --> 00:34:53.796]  That means it's pure.
[00:34:53.896 --> 00:34:56.718]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:59.539]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:53.828]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:53.868 --> 00:36:54.708]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:36:55.029 --> 00:36:59.212]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:05.827 --> 00:37:06.968]  This is breaking news.
[00:37:07.168 --> 00:37:08.269]  Nobody has this yet.
[00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:09.510]  Nobody knows this.
[00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.412]  This is an InfoWars exclusive.
[00:37:11.492 --> 00:37:13.414]  You're only going to get that information here with me.
[00:37:14.094 --> 00:37:20.479]  McMaster is bringing in two people who worked for, I kid you not, Ben Rhodes.
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:31.428]  McMaster is bringing in two holdovers from the Obama administration, two political appointees, two Ben Rhodes loyalists into the NSC.
[00:37:32.409 --> 00:37:33.050]  That's what H.R.
[00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.151]  McMaster is doing.
[00:37:34.832 --> 00:37:37.956]  And fortunately, you know, Sean Spicer loved it.
[00:37:38.537 --> 00:37:40.459]  Sean Spicer leaked to the media all the time.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.221]  That's something that I had never...
[00:37:43.456 --> 00:37:51.262]  That I never made public before, because then, you know, he would try to blacklist me from coming to the White House press briefings and everything, so I had to be careful with Spicer.
[00:37:51.282 --> 00:37:53.304]  Thank God that he's out now.
[00:37:53.524 --> 00:38:04.694]  I can actually tell the truth about what an incompetent guy that was, and how he was sabotaging the administration, how he's leaking the media, how he and Reince Priebus were, they killed the war room idea.
[00:38:04.714 --> 00:38:08.036]  A lot of people didn't know this, but there was going to be a war room
[00:38:08.937 --> 00:38:13.879]  With actual heavy hitters getting content out, getting the media message out.
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:19.782]  Spicer, Renz, McMaster, a few other people within the comms team, they killed the war room.
[00:38:19.802 --> 00:38:21.323]  They said, oh, you're going to politicize.
[00:38:21.343 --> 00:38:22.644]  I kid you not.
[00:38:23.484 --> 00:38:24.104]  I kid you not.
[00:38:24.124 --> 00:38:25.225]  This is why they killed the war room.
[00:38:25.245 --> 00:38:28.206]  They go, you will be politicizing.
[00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:31.788]  You'll be politicizing the communications team.
[00:38:32.418 --> 00:38:36.243]  Like, these are the incompetent or the saboteurs or the snakes.
[00:38:36.824 --> 00:38:38.326]  It doesn't even matter at this point.
[00:38:38.927 --> 00:38:48.100]  These are the kind of people Trump has to deal with where they're saying, well, we wouldn't want our communications department and the most beleaguered and attacked administration in U.S.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:48.560]  history
[00:38:49.221 --> 00:38:50.582]  To actually have a message.
[00:38:51.022 --> 00:38:53.062]  To actually have a rapid response team.
[00:38:53.363 --> 00:38:55.583]  To actually focus on getting out content.
[00:38:55.623 --> 00:38:59.925]  That would be politicizing the communications department.
[00:39:00.465 --> 00:39:01.466]  Who are these people?
[00:39:01.606 --> 00:39:02.666]  And how did they get in?
[00:39:02.686 --> 00:39:07.088]  And that guy, Michael Short, who just got fired, and then he goes, why quit?
[00:39:07.768 --> 00:39:13.890]  So actually another funny story too there is Mooch leaked out that he was going to fire Short as a karma.
[00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.711]  It was like karmic retribution.
[00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:20.612]  So Short had been leaking, so Mooch leaked out that he was going to fire Short.
[00:39:21.353 --> 00:39:24.434]  So then Short found out that he was going to be fired when he opened up Politico.
[00:39:24.694 --> 00:39:28.075]  When people were texting him the article that he was going to get fired.
[00:39:28.795 --> 00:39:31.237]  It's the same way that Trump fired... This is gangster, you know?
[00:39:31.517 --> 00:39:37.642]  The way Trump fired Comey was Comey was giving a talk at the FBI and it flashes on Fox News.
[00:39:38.382 --> 00:39:39.943]  This is how you have to deal with these people.
[00:39:39.963 --> 00:39:43.966]  You're dealing with criminals like James Comey and the communications department.
[00:39:44.547 --> 00:39:47.849]  They're gonna treat these people the way you treat people like that.
[00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:49.010]  You just end it.
[00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.412]  One day they show up and the key doesn't work.
[00:39:51.872 --> 00:39:53.253]  So Mooch knows what he's doing.
[00:39:53.273 --> 00:39:56.596]  He knows that McMaster is leaking and hiring leakers.
[00:39:57.543 --> 00:40:00.906]  And we know that Lindsey Graham is anti-Trump.
[00:40:01.266 --> 00:40:07.310]  And Virginia Oboni, which is exclusive again for me, another leaker that we identified.
[00:40:07.651 --> 00:40:08.651]  So we're getting him.
[00:40:09.052 --> 00:40:10.273]  There's big progress.
[00:40:10.313 --> 00:40:15.156]  And that is why when they said Scaramucci was going to be head of comms, I was through the roof.
[00:40:15.657 --> 00:40:16.477]  I was so hyped.
[00:40:16.858 --> 00:40:18.379]  And then a lot of people, how could you like him?
[00:40:18.619 --> 00:40:19.280]  You know, he's rich.
[00:40:20.103 --> 00:40:22.584]  I'm like, what is wrong with people?
[00:40:22.644 --> 00:40:24.044]  Are they brainwashed zombies?
[00:40:24.784 --> 00:40:26.585]  Nobody hates rich people.
[00:40:27.265 --> 00:40:29.006]  They hate thieves like Hillary Clinton.
[00:40:29.346 --> 00:40:33.387]  Hillary Clinton didn't get rich by providing entrepreneurial value to the world.
[00:40:33.887 --> 00:40:38.029]  Bill Clinton didn't become rich by providing entrepreneurial value to the world.
[00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:42.790]  Barack Obama is not becoming rich by giving value to the world.
[00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:44.571]  These are not intellectuals.
[00:40:44.771 --> 00:40:45.951]  They aren't job creators.
[00:40:46.471 --> 00:40:48.052]  What they do is they use
[00:40:49.039 --> 00:40:53.043]  Their influence and their positions and their power for corruption.
[00:40:53.904 --> 00:40:55.165]  That is what they do.
[00:40:55.665 --> 00:41:02.492]  So we have no problem with people actually make like if Goldman Sachs hadn't ripped people off in the stock market crash, I'd have no problem with Goldman Sachs.
[00:41:02.552 --> 00:41:05.895]  But as we know, they stole from the American public.
[00:41:05.935 --> 00:41:12.882]  They looted, they looted the public and they destroyed a lot of lives and they'd better hope the stock market stays up because it isn't going to.
[00:41:13.763 --> 00:41:14.366]  Be good for them.
[00:41:15.008 --> 00:41:18.080]  If they crash the market again or they're too reckless again, it'll be bad.
[00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:19.526]  So we have great
[00:41:20.728 --> 00:41:23.590]  Great, great developments with Scaramucci.
[00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:29.694]  Finally, we have somebody in the White House who knows how to get a message out.
[00:41:30.214 --> 00:41:33.877]  Now, Scaramucci too, the media loves him because he knows how to handle the media.
[00:41:34.277 --> 00:41:38.359]  So, Scaramucci is a rare guy that can play both games, right?
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.701]  So, I'm really good at one game.
[00:41:41.081 --> 00:41:45.644]  I'm really good at the social media game, direct to consumers, direct to readers, direct to viewers.
[00:41:45.664 --> 00:41:46.184]  So, right now,
[00:41:47.205 --> 00:41:50.948]  Of course, I'm, you know, live on the Real Alex Jones Show, which is amazing.
[00:41:51.148 --> 00:41:52.369]  They're running YouTube Live.
[00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:53.831]  They're running Periscope.
[00:41:54.251 --> 00:41:56.333]  They're on Radio Terrestrial Radio all over the world.
[00:41:56.813 --> 00:41:59.375]  I'm right now on Facebook Live with one phone.
[00:41:59.976 --> 00:42:01.337]  My Periscope is live.
[00:42:01.357 --> 00:42:02.358]  I'm on another iPad.
[00:42:02.838 --> 00:42:05.500]  You know, I need to get another camera set up so I can do YouTube Live.
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.222]  So I'm really good at reaching
[00:42:08.556 --> 00:42:17.680]  Massive amounts of people directly bypassing the media, but I'm not good at playing the traditional media game, and I'm getting better at it.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.581]  Mooch is good at both.
[00:42:19.001 --> 00:42:23.883]  He knows how to reach the people, and he knows how to work with the traditional media people.
[00:42:25.164 --> 00:42:28.985]  He's a rare talent, a once-in-a-generation media talent.
[00:42:29.386 --> 00:42:34.008]  So Mooch, he's in there, and now there's finally Periscope.
[00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:35.030]  Right?
[00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:36.811]  That was a historic moment.
[00:42:37.111 --> 00:42:40.372]  They periscoped President Trump in Air Force One.
[00:42:40.472 --> 00:42:41.133]  We need more of that.
[00:42:41.173 --> 00:42:42.273]  We need fireside chats.
[00:42:42.313 --> 00:42:49.076]  We need the multiple, you know, computers, phones, webcams, whatever you want to call it, streaming live.
[00:42:49.576 --> 00:42:50.236]  They're getting there.
[00:42:50.677 --> 00:42:51.297]  And they're trying.
[00:42:51.977 --> 00:42:53.658]  We have incredible momentum right now.
[00:42:54.178 --> 00:42:55.459]  Scaramucci even said that.
[00:42:55.999 --> 00:42:56.499]  Momentum.
[00:42:57.319 --> 00:42:59.680]  Trump referenced momentum.
[00:43:00.521 --> 00:43:03.482]  How many people understand this and can connect these dots the way I can?
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:05.700]  They don't read books.
[00:43:06.001 --> 00:43:07.321]  They've never read The Art of the Deal.
[00:43:07.621 --> 00:43:10.363]  They've never read Trump's book Think Big and Kick.
[00:43:10.623 --> 00:43:12.364]  We'll call it Butt because I think we're on the radio.
[00:43:12.384 --> 00:43:13.405]  We'll keep it family-friendly.
[00:43:13.865 --> 00:43:14.665]  They don't know anything.
[00:43:15.006 --> 00:43:16.206]  They don't actually study his work.
[00:43:17.107 --> 00:43:21.649]  And there's incredible momentum right now, and both Trump and Scaramucci are momentum players.
[00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:24.711]  I actually got a message from the highest levels today.
[00:43:24.751 --> 00:43:27.813]  I can't say from who, obviously, but the highest level said,
[00:43:28.613 --> 00:43:29.675]  Let your people know today.
[00:43:29.975 --> 00:43:32.078]  Because they knew I was going on Alex Jones.
[00:43:32.118 --> 00:43:32.619]  They saw that.
[00:43:32.639 --> 00:43:34.462]  They monitor my Twitter religiously.
[00:43:34.482 --> 00:43:35.423]  McMaster does too.
[00:43:35.463 --> 00:43:36.404]  He reads it personally.
[00:43:37.326 --> 00:43:38.227]  And he doesn't like it.
[00:43:38.688 --> 00:43:41.452]  People overheard him screaming today about Cernovich's tweets.
[00:43:42.013 --> 00:43:43.495]  They literally... You could...
[00:43:44.599 --> 00:43:52.026]  I mean, if the media really told the truth, they don't tell the truth about Mike Cernovich, though, because they don't want me to look more influential as I actually am.
[00:43:52.146 --> 00:43:58.051]  They don't want to tell the truth about how much impact that we're having because they're trying to get me banned and everything, rather than do hit jobs.
[00:43:59.032 --> 00:44:03.456]  McMaster was heard screaming at the West Wing about Cernovich's tweets.
[00:44:03.997 --> 00:44:05.358]  Effin' tweets screaming!
[00:44:05.478 --> 00:44:06.159]  So he's triggered.
[00:44:06.619 --> 00:44:08.902]  I've heard multiple, you know, 10, 15, 20 people
[00:44:10.697 --> 00:44:16.680]  have told me that McMaster actually has a personal vendetta against me because I'm cyberbullied.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.901]  He said I'm a bully.
[00:44:18.961 --> 00:44:19.742]  And you know who I'm bullying?
[00:44:20.082 --> 00:44:20.902]  You can't make this up.
[00:44:22.683 --> 00:44:23.343]  You can't make it up.
[00:44:23.504 --> 00:44:28.026]  I gotta just pause and take a deep breath because it sounds so absurd and yet it is not.
[00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:28.626]  It is true.
[00:44:28.646 --> 00:44:30.067]  Do you know who I'm bullying?
[00:44:31.187 --> 00:44:32.328]  I'm bullying Deep State.
[00:44:32.948 --> 00:44:33.609]  I kid you not.
[00:44:34.149 --> 00:44:37.631]  They said that it is unfair for me to target
[00:44:38.581 --> 00:44:39.702]  People in the CIA.
[00:44:40.362 --> 00:44:43.804]  People who are at the highest levels of government.
[00:44:43.844 --> 00:44:45.905]  People who are at the highest levels of intelligence.
[00:44:46.346 --> 00:44:49.507]  They said it's unfair for me to target them.
[00:44:50.188 --> 00:44:51.549]  They've been spying on us.
[00:44:52.149 --> 00:44:54.290]  They've been spying on us for decades.
[00:44:54.830 --> 00:45:00.914]  But when I publicly talk about what they're doing and how they're leaking and everything, then I'm just a big bully.
[00:45:01.334 --> 00:45:02.835]  And the media goes along with it.
[00:45:03.215 --> 00:45:07.218]  They're going, in foreign policy, oh yeah, Cernovich is being mean to these people.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:12.787]  I mean, it really... How do you bully a three-star general?
[00:45:12.867 --> 00:45:14.009]  That's what I would like to know.
[00:45:14.489 --> 00:45:21.840]  How do you bully a three-star general, a veteran of multiple... If McMaster isn't strong enough for me, if he's shook...
[00:45:22.717 --> 00:45:31.820]  Maybe he should read Gorilla Mindset or go to one of my seminars and learn how to check into the present moment and learn how to not be rattled and shook up all the time.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.061]  Maybe he needs some mindset.
[00:45:33.081 --> 00:45:36.442]  Maybe I should do a Gorilla Mindset training seminar.
[00:45:36.462 --> 00:45:39.703]  I actually should, now that I think about it.
[00:45:39.783 --> 00:45:41.664]  McMaster, I know you're watching, buddy.
[00:45:41.964 --> 00:45:43.124]  I know you watch everything we do.
[00:45:44.005 --> 00:45:44.705]  I know what you're doing.
[00:45:44.725 --> 00:45:45.625]  You think you spy on me?
[00:45:46.086 --> 00:45:46.726]  That's what you think.
[00:45:48.311 --> 00:45:51.013]  I'll come in and give you a guerrilla mindset seminar.
[00:45:51.493 --> 00:45:54.115]  And I'll give you all the secrets.
[00:45:54.736 --> 00:45:57.798]  And then what'll happen is you'll no longer be a puppet for the globalists.
[00:45:58.178 --> 00:46:01.041]  You'll no longer be a puppet for the warmongers.
[00:46:01.341 --> 00:46:08.006]  You'll actually want to make the world a better place because you'll believe in yourself and you'll find inner peace and happiness and love and joy in your own heart.
[00:46:08.486 --> 00:46:12.729]  And then you're going to want to spread that into the world instead of trying to spread more
[00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:16.972]  Chaos and destruction and murder to the world.
[00:46:17.452 --> 00:46:26.177]  McMaster also too, nobody else had this before me, presented his plan for the Afghan troop surge.
[00:46:26.717 --> 00:46:30.159]  So that was, there was a principal's meeting today, or it was scheduled for today.
[00:46:30.219 --> 00:46:31.359]  These things get moved often.
[00:46:31.879 --> 00:46:34.201]  McMaster is still trying to
[00:46:34.981 --> 00:46:37.564]  Get his troop surge going on.
[00:46:37.704 --> 00:46:39.525]  He really wants more troops in Afghanistan.
[00:46:39.545 --> 00:46:40.506]  He won't let it drop.
[00:46:41.107 --> 00:46:44.290]  Trump is very frustrated with him.
[00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:46.112]  So we got to keep the heat on McMaster.
[00:47:03.049 --> 00:47:07.753]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.433 --> 00:47:10.015]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.415 --> 00:47:15.399]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.759 --> 00:47:21.203]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.604 --> 00:47:28.189]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.990]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.816]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.217 --> 00:48:25.142]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:30.287]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:30.748]  Absolutely!
[00:48:45.828 --> 00:48:48.410]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:49.471]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.811 --> 00:48:50.512]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.552 --> 00:48:51.172]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.533 --> 00:48:59.079]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.099 --> 00:48:59.960]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:00.340]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:04.784]  Ladies and gentlemen, we can see for miles and miles and miles and miles.
[00:49:11.806 --> 00:49:18.971]  Because we have great patriots like Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, who's warned of the dangers of collectivism, globalism, you name it.
[00:49:19.411 --> 00:49:28.798]  He and his wife in 1987 fled South Africa as it was beginning to collapse with $300 and four suitcases and their three children.
[00:49:29.907 --> 00:49:43.750]  And now he has Revival Ministries International, travels 46 weeks out of the year, has their great church in Tampa that supports them, Revival.com, one of the most successful, prolific, and powerful evangelical preachers out there.
[00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:53.692]  Now, three days after this video clip came out of him addressing his church, coming back from Washington this Sunday, Brennan, the former head of the CIA, came out
[00:49:54.744 --> 00:49:57.933]  At the Aspen Institute yesterday, Paul Watson wrote about it today.
[00:49:57.953 --> 00:49:59.718]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.807]  We played the clip three times already and said...
[00:50:04.483 --> 00:50:05.784]  Oh, we're not going to have impeachment.
[00:50:05.864 --> 00:50:18.212]  We're getting bipartisan in the government, the bureaucracy to prepare a coup, confirming everything that a senior member of the Republican Party in Congress told Pastor Rodney Howard Brown of Revival.com.
[00:50:18.312 --> 00:50:20.573]  But now we have them saying it publicly.
[00:50:20.734 --> 00:50:23.715]  So here is the pastor this Sunday laying this out.
[00:50:23.796 --> 00:50:30.620]  And now, days later, the former CIA director, the same one that told the president to shut his mouth, goes public trying to sell the idea.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:31.661]  Here is the pastor.
[00:50:32.758 --> 00:50:42.343]  As high as what Monday was, Tuesday was a low because I got to go into the Congress and spend three hours from 9.30 in the evening to 12.30 a.m.
[00:50:42.863 --> 00:50:52.787]  with one of the senior ranking members of Congress and he told me and of course this is what I said on CBN but they cut it out but I'm gonna go public with this because we have to.
[00:50:53.408 --> 00:50:55.489]  He said there is a plot on Capitol Hill
[00:50:56.269 --> 00:50:57.430]  To take the president out.
[00:50:57.490 --> 00:50:59.931]  I said, you mean by impeachment or by indictment?
[00:50:59.971 --> 00:51:01.432]  He said, no, to take him out.
[00:51:01.772 --> 00:51:03.453]  He will be removed suddenly from office.
[00:51:03.473 --> 00:51:05.234]  Well, you can read between the lines.
[00:51:05.294 --> 00:51:07.535]  I said, look, I said, that's not going to happen.
[00:51:07.976 --> 00:51:10.577]  He said, he said, well, really, there's nothing we can do to stop it.
[00:51:10.637 --> 00:51:16.400]  I said, we are going to stop it because we're going to mobilize the body of Christ to pray.
[00:51:17.581 --> 00:51:19.162]  So listen, they started a war.
[00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:26.351]  You know, they are so upset about what's happening because when since when last has the body of Christ had access into the White House?
[00:51:26.832 --> 00:51:28.413]  It wasn't that way under Reagan.
[00:51:28.813 --> 00:51:30.574]  They might come and go a little bit.
[00:51:30.874 --> 00:51:32.375]  It wasn't that way under Clinton.
[00:51:32.615 --> 00:51:34.317]  It wasn't that way under both Bushes.
[00:51:34.657 --> 00:51:36.698]  And it definitely wasn't that way under Obama.
[00:51:37.018 --> 00:51:39.760]  But we have a president that's opened the door for the body of Christ.
[00:51:40.221 --> 00:51:41.542]  And that is, that is huge.
[00:51:42.062 --> 00:51:43.283]  Whichever way you want to look at it.
[00:51:43.943 --> 00:51:46.767]  And let me tell you, you know, everybody's moaning Republican-Democrat.
[00:51:46.967 --> 00:51:48.049]  He actually is neither.
[00:51:48.289 --> 00:51:52.174]  He's basically a populist that the American people voted for.
[00:51:52.394 --> 00:51:55.198]  They put a businessman in the White House because things are so fouled up.
[00:51:55.638 --> 00:52:00.845]  Well, if you want to really see fouled up, go to Congress and go sit and talk to the... He's been there since 96.
[00:52:02.387 --> 00:52:05.149]  So he knows everything, everything about what's going on.
[00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:12.412]  And I tell you, I can tell you the games that have been played, how they're actually trying to set the president up in every way.
[00:52:12.532 --> 00:52:19.856]  So, but when he told me what he said that they're going to plan, they are planning the talk on the Hill is the plan that suddenly he'll be removed.
[00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:26.315]  So what we're going to do, we're going to launch it today.
[00:52:26.375 --> 00:52:29.177]  It's a 24-hour prayer initiative to pray around the clock.
[00:52:29.337 --> 00:52:32.438]  And we do it across the nation, around the world, for the protection of the president.
[00:52:32.598 --> 00:52:35.180]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, Revival.com.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.581]  Thank you so much for joining us during this critical time.
[00:52:38.641 --> 00:52:41.803]  Hey Alex, I can't believe you're speaking to me from beautiful Hawaii.
[00:52:43.724 --> 00:52:45.765]  And I tell you, you know God's real when you see this place.
[00:52:47.786 --> 00:52:49.407]  It's so good to be here with you today.
[00:52:51.929 --> 00:52:55.951]  You know, we actually have conducted meetings in Washington, D.C.
[00:52:55.991 --> 00:52:56.591]  I started in 2014.
[00:52:56.691 --> 00:53:02.394]  Went to Constitution Hall, which is right in the shadow of the White House, for 15 nights.
[00:53:02.414 --> 00:53:03.855]  Because I didn't know what to do.
[00:53:04.395 --> 00:53:07.837]  You know, we could sit and moan about the things in the government, but we have to do something.
[00:53:08.317 --> 00:53:10.458]  So for 15 nights I went there, preached.
[00:53:10.739 --> 00:53:13.080]  We had 31,000 people give their lives to the Lord.
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:27.504]  And I also stood every night, must have looked like a total idiot, and just issued a restraining order, basically in prayer, telling the devil, you can't have America, speaking to the powers that be, to cease and desist in their maneuvers.
[00:53:28.064 --> 00:53:34.686]  And we went back in 2015, we went back in 2016, and of course now, God has given us a last minute reprieve.
[00:53:34.966 --> 00:53:39.708]  We're not through the woods, because all the Never Trumpers, all the neocons,
[00:53:40.839 --> 00:53:44.480]  All the people that didn't want the president are still working against him.
[00:53:56.525 --> 00:54:00.227]  With the president and different members of the administration were coming in.
[00:54:00.247 --> 00:54:01.807]  We were talking to them, asking questions.
[00:54:02.308 --> 00:54:04.249]  After lunch, Jared Kushner came in.
[00:54:04.289 --> 00:54:05.689]  We asked him questions.
[00:54:05.989 --> 00:54:07.350]  You could ask whatever you want to.
[00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:11.232]  I mean, I don't think this has ever been allowed before in any White House I know.
[00:54:12.256 --> 00:54:16.437]  And then he left about an hour later and walked the Vice President.
[00:54:16.998 --> 00:54:18.418]  And so when I saw him, I stood up.
[00:54:18.458 --> 00:54:20.899]  People didn't know where I was standing, but there was the Vice President.
[00:54:20.919 --> 00:54:22.259]  He said, I was in the Oval Office.
[00:54:22.819 --> 00:54:25.080]  Jared came in, told me that you guys were here.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.421]  And I said, the President, I'm going to go see them.
[00:54:27.441 --> 00:54:30.422]  And the President said, no, bring them down to the Oval Office.
[00:54:30.442 --> 00:54:32.163]  So we went down unannounced.
[00:54:32.303 --> 00:54:35.764]  It was like very surreal for me coming as a missionary from Africa.
[00:54:36.884 --> 00:54:45.016]  30 years ago, now you stand yourself standing in the Oval Office, and I felt to go and stand behind him because I'm not on his side or in front of him, I'm behind him.
[00:54:45.056 --> 00:54:48.100]  I'm supporting our president, and I did from day one.
[00:54:50.336 --> 00:54:59.562]  That picture you see of the hands, that's my hand, my wife's hand, and of course I waited until the White House gave us permission to release it, and then we did.
[00:54:59.642 --> 00:55:05.446]  Of course it went viral, picked up by the Mail Online in London, South Africa, Australia, we were getting calls from all over.
[00:55:05.586 --> 00:55:09.129]  Now, so as high as what Monday was, Tuesday was like a low.
[00:55:09.229 --> 00:55:14.832]  I go into the Congress, and I can't divulge the name, it was a senior congressman, but here's what he said.
[00:55:14.953 --> 00:55:19.155]  The talk on the Hill is that the President will be removed suddenly in the next two months.
[00:55:19.195 --> 00:55:20.096]  I said, what are you talking about?
[00:55:20.496 --> 00:55:21.077]  Impeachment?
[00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:21.778]  Indictment?
[00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:22.359]  He said no.
[00:55:22.839 --> 00:55:24.501]  He'll be removed suddenly.
[00:55:25.062 --> 00:55:29.788]  And I'm not even maybe talking about somebody firing a bullet, but he would be immobilized.
[00:55:30.189 --> 00:55:36.857]  He would be immobilized and at that juncture, then Pence would be president and Paul Ryan would be vice president.
[00:55:37.097 --> 00:55:38.019]  May God help us.
[00:55:38.479 --> 00:55:40.341]  So, here's the thing.
[00:55:41.061 --> 00:55:43.763]  When I was interviewed by CBN, I put it on there.
[00:55:44.023 --> 00:55:45.024]  They never cut it out.
[00:55:45.064 --> 00:55:47.986]  So I thought, I have to go public with it.
[00:55:48.046 --> 00:55:51.929]  And I'm going to meet with the Secret Service and explain what he said.
[00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:54.191]  But he said this was the talk on the Hill.
[00:55:54.431 --> 00:55:56.533]  This is a congressman that totally loves the President.
[00:55:56.973 --> 00:56:02.357]  He cannot even get to the President because the people around the President are blocking him from even getting to the President.
[00:56:02.397 --> 00:56:03.538]  He wants to help the President.
[00:56:03.859 --> 00:56:05.440]  He wants to help the President's agenda.
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:07.962]  But there are people in the Republican Party
[00:56:08.462 --> 00:56:11.004]  And the neocons that are doing everything they can.
[00:56:11.805 --> 00:56:13.446]  So the president said, please, can we do this?
[00:56:13.647 --> 00:56:15.969]  Yes, Mr. President, go and they do the exact opposite.
[00:56:16.289 --> 00:56:17.210]  So that's the problem.
[00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:19.372]  You know, we have to pray for him.
[00:56:19.412 --> 00:56:24.116]  That's why I launched this 24 hour prayer initiative to pray for the protection of the president.
[00:56:24.176 --> 00:56:28.119]  Because, you know, we don't know we this is not how America operates.
[00:56:28.519 --> 00:56:30.181]  You know, we've had a situation
[00:56:30.481 --> 00:56:36.686]  Whereby John Kennedy was taken out, and that was because he was going to totally transform the financial system, and they didn't want that.
[00:56:37.006 --> 00:56:45.011]  Reagan, of course, came out of the blue, but they put Bush Sr., who was the CIA operative, to watch him, and he had a bullet fired across his park.
[00:56:45.372 --> 00:56:52.257]  I mean, you're a lot more of a theologian than I, you've traveled the world like probably nobody else has, one of the biggest missionaries out there.
[00:56:52.617 --> 00:56:56.159]  I mean, what is your gut level spiritual discernment on this?
[00:56:57.139 --> 00:56:58.620]  So Alex, we have been praying.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.222]  We've had, over the years, all night prayer meetings.
[00:57:01.242 --> 00:57:04.684]  That means people come here and they pray right through the night, just for America.
[00:57:05.064 --> 00:57:06.906]  You see, I came from South Africa.
[00:57:06.986 --> 00:57:07.906]  I became a citizen.
[00:57:08.307 --> 00:57:12.209]  I had to raise my hand to pledge to defend the Constitution against enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:16.172]  So as a, even though I'm a minister, I have to speak out.
[00:57:17.052 --> 00:57:20.975]  If we, if I don't speak out, I have to renounce my citizenship and leave.
[00:57:21.395 --> 00:57:25.398]  You cannot be American and not do something about what we're facing.
[00:57:25.478 --> 00:57:26.499]  So here's where we are.
[00:57:27.119 --> 00:57:38.293]  God has heard our cry, and as much as some people get all angry that Trump is not the way that they think that he should be, let me tell you, anybody they would put in there would get eaten alive.
[00:57:39.014 --> 00:57:44.941]  God raised up Donald Trump as a wrecking ball to this globalist agenda to destroy America.
[00:57:46.423 --> 00:57:49.447]  We have a window, and we have to move quickly on this.
[00:57:49.687 --> 00:57:50.928]  We cannot sit idly by.
[00:57:51.068 --> 00:57:52.490]  Everybody must be mobilized.
[00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:56.515]  Everybody must speak out, and we have to wake up the population.
[00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.060]  I've talked to Trump.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:02.801]  He brings it up.
[00:58:03.181 --> 00:58:05.542]  He says, you feel the spirit in that inauguration.
[00:58:05.922 --> 00:58:10.684]  Do you feel the spirit at the event there in Cleveland?
[00:58:11.064 --> 00:58:14.946]  He really does feel the energy of God and of Christians.
[00:58:15.046 --> 00:58:19.708]  And the more Christians embrace him, the more his faith is getting strengthened.
[00:58:19.968 --> 00:58:21.288]  That's what's scaring him right now.
[00:58:21.348 --> 00:58:23.909]  Pastor, thank you so much for spending time with us.
