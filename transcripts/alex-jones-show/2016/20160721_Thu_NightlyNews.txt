[00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:20.943]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:20.963 --> 00:00:22.864]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.985 --> 00:00:23.865]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:25.807]  It is Thursday, July 21st, 2016.
[00:00:26.468 --> 00:00:29.771]  And here's a quick look at what we've got coming up.
[00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:34.311]  Tonight.
[00:00:35.712 --> 00:00:39.613]  And I'm telling him again, sir, there's no need for a firearm.
[00:00:39.953 --> 00:00:40.713]  I'm unarmed.
[00:00:41.093 --> 00:00:42.293]  He's an autistic guy.
[00:00:42.573 --> 00:00:44.614]  He had a toy truck in his hand.
[00:00:44.814 --> 00:00:47.875]  When he hit me, I'm like, I still got my hands in there.
[00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:49.595]  I said, no, I just got shot.
[00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:59.638]  While police brutality continues to be an issue here in the U.S., the stories that often don't get told are the ones where officers are put in danger.
[00:01:00.538 --> 00:01:01.239]  That's next.
[00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:02.279]  Well, what?
[00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:04.952]  Because I don't know what you have under there.
[00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:06.093]  Everybody look at this guy!
[00:01:06.354 --> 00:01:10.417]  He came clearly to do some harm to the officer, to my person.
[00:01:10.457 --> 00:01:11.518]  It's hard to make that call.
[00:01:11.598 --> 00:01:13.740]  It shakes you up.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.243]  Any protests over the deaths of these cops today in Baton Rouge?
[00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:18.784]  I don't know that, I don't know that.
[00:01:19.164 --> 00:01:24.168]  Any riots or protests over the police officers in Dallas, Texas?
[00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.091]  What are you asking?
[00:01:28.132 --> 00:01:29.273]  It's a pretty simple question.
[00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:02.377]  Hi, I'm Dr. David Jones.
[00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:05.420]  I've been in practice for over 30 years in dentistry.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.444]  In our health histories, we've always asked what people's primary complaint were.
[00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:12.006]  A third of the time, it's, I want whiter teeth.
[00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:26.279]  In the early days of dentistry, we used some fairly harsh chemicals in order to bleach the teeth and whiten them, and people were happy with the results, even though it created hypersensitivity and some problems that I consider fairly high risk.
[00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.901]  Recently, I was exposed to the Ghost Smile System.
[00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:36.324]  It allows a whitening gel to be applied to the teeth with a very good ultrasonic toothbrush system.
[00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:51.691]  The gel is activated by a light-emitting diode, or actually two light-emitting diodes, so it's a simple and elegant procedure that delivers office-quality whitening, and you don't have to spend the $600 it typically costs for an in-office treatment.
[00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:55.797]  In my opinion, it's the most elegant and best value that I've ever seen.
[00:02:56.017 --> 00:02:59.823]  To get your GoSmile system, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:03:02.213 --> 00:03:22.408]  You know, it was less than a week ago on Sunday morning that the Baton Rouge shooter Gavin Long targeted and assassinated police officers in a deadly ambush that left three officers dead and another three injured before he was shot and killed by a single marksman from a hundred yards away.
[00:03:22.428 --> 00:03:25.931]  The surveillance photos recently released to the public
[00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:38.097]  Show the killer carrying out his deadly attack on Baton Rouge police as they were cornered by a dumpster behind a beauty supply store before they were executed.
[00:03:38.698 --> 00:03:49.904]  The three police officers who were killed in this gutless and senseless rampage were Matthew Gerald, a former Marine who had only spent one year on the police force.
[00:03:50.504 --> 00:04:11.584]  Montrell Jackson, a new father and 10-year veteran of the force, and Brad Garofalo, married man, father of four children, who, by the way, went down fighting, firing his weapon till the end in the gun battle as he bravely attempted to save one of his fellow officers.
[00:04:12.574 --> 00:04:23.942]  The killer before the rampage, Gavin Long, he posted a video on YouTube where he laid out his warped and delusional manifesto.
[00:04:25.002 --> 00:04:26.703]  If y'all want to keep protesting, do that.
[00:04:26.763 --> 00:04:32.207]  But for the serious ones, the real ones, the alpha ones, we know what it's going to take.
[00:04:33.188 --> 00:04:36.490]  It's only fighting back for money.
[00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.931]  That's all they care about.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:56.428]  After he put that video up on YouTube, he made it perfectly clear on Facebook and Twitter that he was outraged over the death of this man.
[00:04:57.148 --> 00:05:01.571]  Alton Sterling, who had been recently killed by Baton Rouge police.
[00:05:01.892 --> 00:05:08.416]  And what followed was massive protest across the country, led by none other than Black Lives Matter.
[00:05:08.697 --> 00:05:10.818]  And we all know what happened next in Dallas.
[00:05:11.218 --> 00:05:14.481]  The first wave of retaliation had begun.

[00:05:38.286 --> 00:05:38.466]  Go!
[00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:38.706]  Go!
[00:05:38.726 --> 00:05:39.026]  Go!
[00:05:39.126 --> 00:05:39.406]  Go!
[00:05:39.426 --> 00:05:39.486]  Go!
[00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:39.606]  Go!
[00:05:39.686 --> 00:05:39.866]  Go!
[00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:40.246]  Go!
[00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:40.567]  Go!
[00:05:40.687 --> 00:05:41.007]  Go!
[00:05:41.127 --> 00:05:41.247]  Go!
[00:05:41.287 --> 00:05:41.527]  Go!
[00:05:41.547 --> 00:05:41.587]  Go!
[00:05:41.627 --> 00:05:41.767]  Go!
[00:05:41.787 --> 00:05:41.827]  Go!
[00:05:41.847 --> 00:05:41.967]  Go!
[00:05:42.027 --> 00:05:42.267]  Go!
[00:05:42.287 --> 00:05:42.527]  Go!
[00:05:42.547 --> 00:05:42.667]  Go!
[00:05:42.707 --> 00:05:42.987]  Go!
[00:05:43.048 --> 00:05:43.268]  Go!
[00:05:43.288 --> 00:05:43.468]  Go!
[00:05:43.568 --> 00:05:44.008]  Go!
[00:05:44.388 --> 00:05:44.528]  Go!
[00:05:44.568 --> 00:05:44.688]  Go!
[00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:44.868]  Go!
[00:05:44.888 --> 00:05:44.988]  Go!
[00:05:45.068 --> 00:05:45.348]  Go!
[00:05:45.388 --> 00:05:45.609]  Go!
[00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:45.849]  Go!
[00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:46.089]  Go!
[00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:46.589]  Go!
[00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:19.108]  Some of these really aren't to the teeth.
[00:06:19.968 --> 00:06:21.550]  This is not one person with a tooth.
[00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.554]  This is a person with a tooth.
[00:06:30.802 --> 00:06:31.742]  Is that a cop dead?
[00:06:32.243 --> 00:06:35.644]  Dude, that's a cop down.
[00:06:35.904 --> 00:06:37.645]  Dude, that's a cop down.
[00:06:38.025 --> 00:06:38.306]  Four?
[00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:40.046]  It's a dude?
[00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:42.087]  It's a sniper?
[00:07:09.245 --> 00:07:23.396]  When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same.
[00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:24.477]  And that hurts.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:35.644]  Now, I want to take a look at the raw footage of Alton Sterling getting shot and killed by police in Baton Rouge.
[00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:42.748]  And I got to warn you that this is graphic video, so if you're not the kind of person that can stomach this type of stuff, you might want to turn your head for a moment.
[00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:49.773]  But I think it's important that we analyze the video because the death of Alton Sterling played a big role
[00:07:50.393 --> 00:07:53.116]  And, well, pissing off the Black Lives Matter movement.
[00:07:53.216 --> 00:08:01.623]  I mean, there was protest all across the nation and it also led to the retaliation and murder of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge.
[00:08:01.884 --> 00:08:04.206]  Again, this is graphic video.
[00:08:04.626 --> 00:08:06.808]  Viewer discretion is advised.
[00:08:07.369 --> 00:08:15.937]  Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana responded to a 911 call about a man walking around waving a gun and threatening people.
[00:08:16.497 --> 00:08:20.340]  The altercation with Alton Sterling began shortly after the cops arrived.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.243]  I mean, you can see there he's resisting arrest.
[00:08:23.323 --> 00:08:26.285]  The police officers, they had to throw him to the ground.
[00:08:26.425 --> 00:08:33.371]  He was trying to get the gun out of his pocket and, well, the police had to deal with a life-or-death situation.
[00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:37.074]  The suspect was shot and killed on the spot.
[00:08:37.634 --> 00:08:42.859]  You can see right there they did indeed retrieve a gun from his pocket.
[00:08:43.635 --> 00:08:56.721]  Now, if you're one of those people who think that the officers reacted unjustly in this situation, I want you to stop and consider for a moment what it must be like to be in their shoes for a change.
[00:08:56.761 --> 00:08:57.661]  You think you could do that?
[00:08:58.702 --> 00:09:10.467]  I mean, these cops, and we're talking about inner-city cops, their job is to confront potentially dangerous and deadly situations day in and day out.
[00:09:11.007 --> 00:09:12.048]  Alton Sterling,
[00:09:13.214 --> 00:09:25.260]  was portrayed by the media as an innocent guy, a father of five who was murdered on the bloody streets of Baton Rouge by white cops because, well, because he was black.
[00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:29.383]  But in reality, this guy was a career criminal.
[00:09:29.763 --> 00:09:33.305]  He was a street thug with a rap sheet a mile long.
[00:09:33.385 --> 00:09:35.926]  He was a danger to society.
[00:09:36.847 --> 00:09:38.828]  Check out this guy's criminal record.
[00:09:39.744 --> 00:09:40.724]  I mean, my God!
[00:09:41.244 --> 00:09:43.685]  Possession of illegal firearms.
[00:09:44.445 --> 00:09:45.646]  Again and again and again.
[00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:48.806]  Aggravated burglary on more than one occasion.
[00:09:49.126 --> 00:09:51.007]  Drug possession over and over.
[00:09:51.487 --> 00:09:53.208]  Public intimidation.
[00:09:53.368 --> 00:09:54.948]  Possession of stolen goods.
[00:09:54.968 --> 00:09:58.809]  He had several altercations and fights with police officers.
[00:09:59.209 --> 00:10:00.269]  Domestic abuse.
[00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.910]  Breaking and entering.
[00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.671]  And yes, he was a registered sex offender.
[00:10:06.351 --> 00:10:11.402]  And when the cops showed up, they knew he had a gun on him, and when he tried to pull it, they put him down.
[00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:24.943]  I call for white people like myself to put ourselves in the shoes of those African American families who fear every time their children go somewhere.
[00:10:25.383 --> 00:10:36.147]  Who have to have the talk about, you know, how to really protect themselves when they're the ones who should be expecting protection from encounters with the police.
[00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:48.572]  Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are asking white Americans to put themselves in the shoes of African Americans to see what it's like to be racially profiled by police.
[00:10:49.313 --> 00:10:51.634]  I'd like to see Black Lives Matter do the same.
[00:10:52.034 --> 00:10:54.115]  Put yourselves in the cops' shoes.
[00:10:55.191 --> 00:10:59.373]  If you saw that video, they pulled something like this from his pocket.
[00:10:59.513 --> 00:11:12.839]  Don't know if it was a gun, but I'm just about to show you naysayers who probably haven't had a lick of firearms training whether or not somebody could actually shoot from their pockets.
[00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:13.480]  Here we go.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.461]  Now I got on my shorts, okay?
[00:11:15.861 --> 00:11:16.161]  Bam!
[00:11:16.421 --> 00:11:17.081]  In my pocket.
[00:11:17.141 --> 00:11:17.702]  Here we go.
[00:11:18.242 --> 00:11:22.144]  Well, if I have my hands in my pocket, oh s***!
[00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:24.954]  I can still shoot from here.
[00:11:25.214 --> 00:11:26.155]  How about that?
[00:11:26.595 --> 00:11:28.216]  Or, hands down at my side.
[00:11:28.336 --> 00:11:28.637]  Bam!
[00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:29.577]  How about that?
[00:11:29.937 --> 00:11:31.759]  I can still shoot from here.
[00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:34.781]  All I have to do is touch the trigger and shoot.
[00:11:35.021 --> 00:11:37.503]  And if I'm down on my back and I'm in a struggle.
[00:11:37.703 --> 00:11:38.003]  Pow!
[00:11:38.103 --> 00:11:38.343]  Pow!
[00:11:38.423 --> 00:11:38.743]  Pow!
[00:11:38.783 --> 00:11:40.905]  You don't know what the f*** you would do.
[00:11:41.285 --> 00:11:46.469]  So for those of you all who say the gun wasn't fully extended and drawn.
[00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:50.775]  You don't know a damn thing about guns!
[00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:52.155]  And that was U.S.
[00:11:52.296 --> 00:12:05.464]  Army veteran Mike Brown in a video post on Facebook showing us the dangerous situation that the Baton Rouge police found themselves in when they had to confront Alton Sterling.
[00:12:05.704 --> 00:12:09.907]  I mean, all Sterling had to do was grab his pocket and fire off a few rounds.
[00:12:10.387 --> 00:12:13.089]  Those cops were in immediate danger.
[00:12:13.569 --> 00:12:14.310]  What would you have done?
[00:12:15.168 --> 00:12:16.889]  Here's another video I want to share with you.
[00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:21.850]  Now, this is raw body cam footage shot by police in Savannah, Georgia.
[00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:26.212]  This is a routine traffic stop that turns deadly.
[00:12:27.232 --> 00:12:33.834]  If you was on the right, which is where you came from, I must have missed you.
[00:12:33.874 --> 00:12:37.976]  I put my blinkers on, stopped at a stop sign, and I don't know why.
[00:12:38.016 --> 00:12:39.056]  You got your license on you, partner?
[00:12:39.816 --> 00:12:40.596]  I don't have my license on me.
[00:12:40.616 --> 00:12:42.197]  It's at my mom's house.
[00:12:43.314 --> 00:12:44.495]  Do you want me to turn off your car?
[00:12:44.655 --> 00:12:45.216]  Okay, that's fine.
[00:12:45.396 --> 00:12:45.976]  Turn off the car.
[00:12:46.697 --> 00:12:47.157]  Hand me the key.
[00:12:52.802 --> 00:12:55.824]  I'm just going to set it up here until we run your information and get it from there.
[00:12:56.745 --> 00:12:56.845]  Okay?
[00:12:56.865 --> 00:12:57.065]  Okay.
[00:13:06.113 --> 00:13:06.533]  What's your name?
[00:13:07.114 --> 00:13:07.534]  Tariq.
[00:13:07.874 --> 00:13:08.795]  T-Y-R-I-E.
[00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:10.577]  Last name?
[00:13:11.037 --> 00:13:11.337]  Tyler.
[00:13:11.657 --> 00:13:11.938]  T-Y-R-I-E.
[00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:27.142]  C-U-I C-U C-U-I Y L-E-R And spell your first name again Tyree T-Y-R-E Alright, is there anything in this car that we need to know about or worry about?
[00:13:27.162 --> 00:13:31.023]  No sir Alright Mind stepping out since you're acting a little nervous and stuff?
[00:13:31.364 --> 00:13:41.606]  I'm not acting nervous sir Yeah, you're acting a little nervous, you was hesitating on handing me the key and everything so go ahead and step out the vehicle No I was not sir Do me a favor, step out the vehicle
[00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:47.959]  Alright, I just want to make sure there's no weapons or anything.
[00:13:48.139 --> 00:13:49.639]  Do not be reaching in there, partner.
[00:13:49.699 --> 00:13:55.861]  Now you can see right there how quick this happened.
[00:13:55.901 --> 00:14:02.843]  Before you know it, the guy whips out a gun, shoots the officer, the cop goes down, and the suspect attempts to escape.
[00:14:03.263 --> 00:14:05.204]  The police return rapid fire.
[00:14:05.664 --> 00:14:10.465]  The suspect, 25-year-old Tyree Collier, was killed in the incident.
[00:14:10.745 --> 00:14:12.886]  And luckily, the officer survived.
[00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.971]  And it happened just like that.
[00:14:20.232 --> 00:14:23.653]  And, you know, that's what these cops deal with on a daily basis.
[00:14:23.733 --> 00:14:30.637]  And I think we all need to stop for a moment and think about what it's like to be in their shoes before we rush to judgment.
[00:14:31.277 --> 00:14:41.843]  And that's the problem I have with Black Lives Matter and the people who support their ideology, because it seems like they always rally behind the wrong guy.
[00:14:42.483 --> 00:14:47.685]  I mean, there's plenty of examples of cops abusing their power, using excessive force.
[00:14:47.745 --> 00:14:50.326]  There's lots of examples of police brutality.
[00:14:50.466 --> 00:14:54.928]  And yes, in some cases, cops are getting away with murder.
[00:14:55.448 --> 00:14:58.329]  But why rally behind a guy like Alton Sterling?
[00:14:58.349 --> 00:15:00.950]  I mean, that guy was street trash.
[00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.812]  And he should not be the poster child for racial profiling.
[00:15:06.172 --> 00:15:15.196]  I also think it's counterproductive to walk around yelling Black Lives Matter while threatening violence towards police.
[00:15:16.496 --> 00:15:19.698]  Any protests over the deaths of these cops today in Baton Rouge?
[00:15:19.978 --> 00:15:20.698]  I don't know that.
[00:15:20.718 --> 00:15:21.278]  I don't know that.
[00:15:21.619 --> 00:15:26.601]  Any riots or protests over the police officers in Dallas, Texas?
[00:15:28.822 --> 00:15:29.522]  What are you asking?
[00:15:30.489 --> 00:15:31.730]  That's a pretty simple question.
[00:15:33.011 --> 00:15:34.011]  Yeah, good question.
[00:15:34.952 --> 00:15:39.975]  And you know, I thought the news crew from Fox 10 in Phoenix, Arizona did a good job.
[00:15:39.995 --> 00:15:58.526]  You can see the video right there on YouTube, and we're going to show you a couple of short clips, but they invited one of the leaders of Black Lives Matter to a training session by police to see what it's like to be a cop in a dangerous situation where you have to make a split-second decision whether or not to shoot someone.
[00:15:58.806 --> 00:15:59.407]  Check this out.
[00:15:59.927 --> 00:16:02.230]  Call about a possible burglar walking down the street.
[00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:03.931]  Moppin' gets him on the ground.
[00:16:04.152 --> 00:16:04.992]  He's not complying.
[00:16:05.073 --> 00:16:06.194]  I need you to keep your hands up, sir.
[00:16:06.394 --> 00:16:06.734]  For what?
[00:16:07.095 --> 00:16:08.676]  Because I need to check that waistband.
[00:16:08.696 --> 00:16:09.898]  For what?
[00:16:10.859 --> 00:16:11.279]  What are you doing?
[00:16:11.299 --> 00:16:12.540]  Because I don't know what you have under there.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.682]  Everybody look at this guy!
[00:16:13.942 --> 00:16:18.006]  He came clearly to do some harm to the officer, to my person.
[00:16:18.046 --> 00:16:19.107]  It's hard to make that call.
[00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.290]  It shakes you up.
[00:16:21.806 --> 00:16:28.412]  So that guy changed his opinion after spending the day with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department in Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:16:28.552 --> 00:16:31.394]  Again, you have to put yourself in their shoes.
[00:16:31.714 --> 00:16:33.416]  Now, I want to share another video.
[00:16:33.636 --> 00:16:38.740]  Now, this is a woman who was protesting police in Dallas with Black Lives Matter.
[00:16:39.661 --> 00:16:43.784]  She got shot in the leg and, you know, that was during that horrific day.
[00:16:44.525 --> 00:16:50.010]  And when it was all said and done, she had a change of heart about the Dallas Police Department.
[00:16:50.814 --> 00:16:53.115]  Police officers have started coming up the block.
[00:16:54.315 --> 00:16:57.797]  And one of them, I heard him when he said, is anybody hit?
[00:16:58.057 --> 00:16:58.797]  I said, yes, sir.
[00:16:58.817 --> 00:16:59.897]  I'm hitting my leg.
[00:17:00.158 --> 00:17:05.340]  And that officer jumped on top of me and covered me and my foot.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.920]  I saw another officer.
[00:17:11.226 --> 00:17:14.930]  I saw another officer get shot right there in front of me.
[00:17:15.391 --> 00:17:18.494]  I'm so thankful for the Dallas Police Department.
[00:17:19.095 --> 00:17:26.764]  Now before we go, I want to read a message from Officer Montrell Jackson, who posted this on Facebook just days...
[00:17:27.864 --> 00:17:31.787]  Before he was fatally shot and killed in Baton Rouge.
[00:17:32.367 --> 00:17:35.169]  The city must and will get better.
[00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:47.458]  I'm working in these streets, so any protesters, officers, friends, family, or whoever, if you see me and need a hug or want to say a prayer, I got you.
[00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:54.704]  Finally, I personally want to send prayers out to everyone directly affected by this tragedy.
[00:17:55.663 --> 00:17:57.344]  These are trying times.
[00:17:58.024 --> 00:18:01.446]  Please don't let hate infect your heart.
[00:18:02.146 --> 00:18:12.132]  Montrell Jackson was 32 years old, a 10-year veteran of the Baton Rouge Police Department, and a proud father of a newborn son.
[00:18:13.266 --> 00:18:18.450]  In honor of Montrell Jackson, I want to end this report on a positive note.
[00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:25.696]  Because regardless of what you see on TV, there is progress being made to unite the country, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:26.477 --> 00:18:32.802]  During a BLM protest in Dallas, a counter-protest started across the street.
[00:18:33.462 --> 00:18:35.444]  Then a representative from each group.
[00:18:35.484 --> 00:18:38.025]  Well, they met in the middle and they joined forces.
[00:18:38.646 --> 00:18:47.712]  And before going home, they actually got together and they prayed for the city of Dallas together.
[00:18:48.573 --> 00:18:50.154]  And I'd like to thank Montrell.
[00:18:50.214 --> 00:18:52.035]  Watch that moment from above.
[00:18:53.096 --> 00:18:55.358]  And I hope it put a big smile on his face.
[00:19:01.237 --> 00:19:03.357]  Hillary for prison shirts are $19.95.
[00:19:03.398 --> 00:19:04.758]  We've been selling them as low as $5.
[00:19:04.878 --> 00:19:06.358]  I want to get tens of thousands of them out there.
[00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:08.299]  There's like 80,000 of them now out there or something.
[00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:10.179]  They're all over the country.
[00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:11.439]  It's one of the top memes in the nation.
[00:19:11.679 --> 00:19:15.680]  But at $19.95, we can take all the proceeds and pay for aircraft in the skies.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.361]  You've seen that be national news.
[00:19:17.601 --> 00:19:18.981]  You've seen that be the top meme in the country.
[00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:19.521]  It's amazing.
[00:19:20.061 --> 00:19:21.942]  We're leading the way on how to resist.
[00:19:22.582 --> 00:19:23.462]  We're ragtag.
[00:19:23.802 --> 00:19:25.583]  We're cross-eyed and exhausted half the time.
[00:19:25.843 --> 00:19:26.843]  But we've got the passion.
[00:19:26.863 --> 00:19:27.723]  We're going over the top.
[00:19:28.103 --> 00:19:30.944]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:19:31.184 --> 00:19:38.949]  I'm selling at $19.95 to pay for the banners, to pay for the 18-wheelers with the big signs, to pay for the Jumbotron videos, and it's really paying off.
[00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:40.970]  Hundreds of newspapers, TV, Hillary for President.
[00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.133]  You cannot, but all the shirts we sell, all the ones we have, it's like $60,000.
[00:19:46.113 --> 00:19:47.754]  So, but we got more being printed right now.
[00:19:47.794 --> 00:19:55.759]  Everybody's got to go buy a Hillary for President shirt for $19.95, show that in full or so you can get on the whole, because I want to really go crazy with airplanes at the DNC.
[00:19:56.099 --> 00:19:57.260]  We're looking at blimps as well.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.581]  We're not going to be censored.
[00:19:58.661 --> 00:19:59.823]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:19:59.863 --> 00:20:01.325]  Get your Hillary for President shirts today.
[00:20:01.685 --> 00:20:03.888]  Look in the last eight months how far that meme's come.
[00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:08.294]  In one block that I walked just a minute ago, I saw 15 of those shirts.
[00:20:08.714 --> 00:20:09.736]  Just in one block!
[00:20:10.256 --> 00:20:12.659]  The drive here from my spot where I'm staying.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.001]  30, 40 tons of them.
[00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:17.383]  They're every single winner.
[00:20:17.403 --> 00:20:22.326]  The rally yesterday, almost everyone in the crowd had on a Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:20:22.486 --> 00:20:23.647]  It is amazing.
[00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:27.049]  Everyone stops and they go, what does that shirt mean?
[00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:27.409]  Why?
[00:20:27.489 --> 00:20:28.830]  Why does she need to go to prison?
[00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:35.314]  And it allows us to engage in a conversation and teach these people who have no clue about who Hillary really is.
[00:20:35.874 --> 00:20:37.596]  About all the things she's been involved in.
[00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:38.857]  And we're not laying down to that witch.
[00:20:38.897 --> 00:20:40.418]  She's not, she's not going to buffalo us.
[00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:41.419]  We're not coward.
[00:20:41.439 --> 00:20:42.220]  We're not broke back.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.981]  We're taking action.
[00:20:43.001 --> 00:20:43.501]  What about you?
[00:20:43.802 --> 00:20:44.722]  Get your Hillary for President shirt.
[00:20:44.762 --> 00:20:45.483]  I know you already have one.
[00:20:45.503 --> 00:20:45.944]  Buy another one.
[00:20:46.184 --> 00:20:47.125]  Give it to friends and family.
[00:20:47.465 --> 00:20:50.248]  I'm telling you, the war is now, the war is an info war.
[00:20:50.488 --> 00:20:51.068]  We're going to win.
[00:20:51.569 --> 00:20:54.291]  It's now been duplicated by countless groups and I think that's wonderful.
[00:20:55.273 --> 00:21:02.196]  Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and now it's all over CNN, it's all over Fox, it's all over the Trump rallies, the Hillary rallies.
[00:21:02.556 --> 00:21:09.618]  The number one search term for a week straight, last week, and still continuing, one of the top search terms is, is Hillary going to jail?
[00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.059]  This has been incredibly successful.
[00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:16.701]  Because it shows, despite corporate control, and despite them trying to control the meme,
[00:21:17.341 --> 00:21:19.663]  We've had three versions of the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[00:21:20.183 --> 00:21:23.606]  All of them have been collector's edition and have helped fund the InfoWar.
[00:21:24.186 --> 00:21:26.748]  We now have a third edition in.
[00:21:26.989 --> 00:21:28.310]  The second edition sold out.
[00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:45.223]  It's the same as the last, but on the right shoulder says InfoWars.com, on the back it says InfoWars.com, legalized freedom, be part of history, be part of supporting the InfoWar, be part of meeting like-minded friends and family.
[00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:53.975]  Get your Hillary for Prison 2016 3rd Wave Shirts at InfoWarStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:01.394 --> 00:22:01.874]  Not a group.
[00:22:01.914 --> 00:22:03.314]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:22:03.354 --> 00:22:04.435]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:22:04.695 --> 00:22:05.615]  Why is this so good?
[00:22:05.895 --> 00:22:11.136]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:22:11.216 --> 00:22:24.780]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.200]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.581]  Spreading disease around.
[00:22:28.642 --> 00:22:31.124]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:32.485]  These are all parasites.
[00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:33.646]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:34.687]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:22:34.987 --> 00:22:39.330]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:22:39.531 --> 00:22:42.693]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:22:42.713 --> 00:22:45.876]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:22:45.916 --> 00:22:46.917]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:22:46.957 --> 00:22:47.477]  Living Defense.
[00:22:47.777 --> 00:22:48.838]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:48.898 --> 00:22:49.919]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:22:49.939 --> 00:22:51.961]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:22:53.522 --> 00:22:54.505]  You support the broadcast.
[00:22:54.565 --> 00:22:55.647]  Infowarslives.com.
[00:22:55.908 --> 00:22:57.812]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:22:58.173 --> 00:23:00.157]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:23:06.325 --> 00:23:08.927]  First of all, Alex, this ain't no f****** show!
[00:23:09.007 --> 00:23:11.089]  I'm not afraid of you!
[00:23:11.309 --> 00:23:12.750]  I'm not afraid of you!
[00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:14.311]  I'm not afraid of you!
[00:23:30.761 --> 00:23:31.122]  All right.
[00:23:31.142 --> 00:23:32.482]  Roger, yeah, run away.
[00:23:32.542 --> 00:23:33.503]  Roger, don't go.
[00:23:33.583 --> 00:23:35.224]  He wants to debate you right now.
[00:23:35.244 --> 00:23:37.665]  I'm not going to debate this thing.
[00:23:37.685 --> 00:23:38.405]  You're a hatchet.
[00:23:38.505 --> 00:23:41.186]  I don't know what's going on in the media here.
[00:23:41.266 --> 00:23:41.747]  I'm serious.
[00:23:41.807 --> 00:23:42.827]  All you do is lie.
[00:23:42.927 --> 00:23:45.568]  You're always the biggest liar in the media.
[00:23:45.668 --> 00:23:48.050]  You're the biggest liar in the media.
[00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:48.970]  No, you ain't go.
[00:23:53.507 --> 00:23:54.269]  He's like, slow down, slow down!
[00:24:03.988 --> 00:24:05.709]  We're talking about that all the time.
[00:24:25.058 --> 00:24:26.839]  Is there people on drugs?
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.360]  Is that what you think?
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.841]  Is there people on drugs?
[00:24:29.961 --> 00:24:31.162]  Is that what you think?
[00:24:31.202 --> 00:24:33.583]  You're anti-liberal and you're pissed.
[00:24:33.603 --> 00:24:35.484]  You know what I care about?
[00:24:35.584 --> 00:24:37.825]  I care about the American people.
[00:24:37.925 --> 00:24:38.626]  I'm not lying.
[00:24:38.706 --> 00:24:39.786]  I'm not lying.
[00:24:39.926 --> 00:24:40.867]  I'm not lying.
[00:24:53.285 --> 00:24:53.525]  I'm not sad.
[00:24:53.585 --> 00:24:54.206]  I'm really excited about it.
[00:25:24.286 --> 00:25:29.068]  Liane McAdoo with InfoWars.com here in Cleveland covering the Republican National Convention.
[00:25:29.348 --> 00:25:31.669]  And we got word that there's a surprise visitor in town.
[00:25:31.949 --> 00:25:34.510]  Brexit mastermind Nigel Farage is here.
[00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.731]  Of course, he played a key role in Britain's decision to leave the EU.
[00:25:38.071 --> 00:25:45.054]  We're going to find out if he thinks Donald Trump has what it takes to help lead America outside of the clutches of globalist powers.
[00:25:46.014 --> 00:25:49.897]  Alright, so talk to me a little bit about the rise in nationalism that we're seeing globally.
[00:25:50.278 --> 00:25:58.224]  So many people are saying it's racism, xenophobia, rather than citizens wanting to rise up, reclaim their sovereignty from global powers.
[00:25:58.504 --> 00:26:01.987]  So what do you really see is behind Brexit and other countries?
[00:26:02.267 --> 00:26:19.675]  Well, what I've seen is several decades of big politics, big government, treating democracy with contempt, treating anybody that was even vaguely patriotic about their country and their identity as somehow being really absolutely awful.
[00:26:19.695 --> 00:26:22.116]  I mean, what a dreadful thing for people to do.
[00:26:24.678 --> 00:26:32.783]  An international political order that has led us into an endless series of foreign wars, which in many cases have made things worse, not better.
[00:26:33.623 --> 00:26:36.045]  And at the heart of all of it, corporatism.
[00:26:36.545 --> 00:26:44.971]  The big international businesses virtually owning politics, and the rich getting massively richer, and the ordinary Joe being left behind.
[00:26:45.011 --> 00:26:46.952]  So things have gone badly wrong.
[00:26:47.652 --> 00:26:50.555]  And I think people have become very unhappy about this.
[00:26:50.615 --> 00:26:51.696]  They recognize this.
[00:26:52.316 --> 00:26:56.039]  And they're beginning to find political opportunities to express that.
[00:26:56.439 --> 00:26:58.201]  And Brexit was exactly that.
[00:26:58.421 --> 00:27:05.687]  Brexit was, despite everybody threatening us, everyone telling us it'd be a terrible mistake, the British people said, to hell with you.
[00:27:06.327 --> 00:27:11.590]  We want to take back power over our lives, and that's actually what it's about.
[00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:15.352]  That's what this reassertion of democracy is really about.
[00:27:15.492 --> 00:27:25.918]  Right, and we saw so much fear being put out there, so many naysayers, so many doomsdayers, really kind of warning the rest of the world, don't you dare think about reclaiming your sovereignty.
[00:27:27.178 --> 00:27:30.240]  What do you see would be the effect of Brexit for the world?
[00:27:30.951 --> 00:27:35.753]  Well, what Brexit shows, firstly, is that any campaign can win.
[00:27:36.514 --> 00:27:37.494]  Any campaign can win.
[00:27:37.774 --> 00:27:39.035]  You can beat the big guys.
[00:27:39.095 --> 00:27:44.758]  You can beat the establishment if you inspire ordinary people to engage in a democratic process.
[00:27:44.778 --> 00:27:46.359]  That's the first thing.
[00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:52.402]  And secondly, I just have a feeling that things aren't ever going to be quite the same again.
[00:27:53.622 --> 00:27:56.364]  I think it's such a fundamental... It's not just a British event.
[00:27:56.864 --> 00:27:58.065]  It's not just a European event.
[00:28:01.331 --> 00:28:01.952]  And that's good.
[00:28:02.252 --> 00:28:02.933]  We need change.
[00:28:02.953 --> 00:28:07.697]  I mean, unless people think that voting can change things, why would you ever bother to vote?
[00:28:08.698 --> 00:28:09.219]  Absolutely.
[00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:12.882]  And so now you're here in Cleveland at the Republican National Convention.
[00:28:12.902 --> 00:28:15.545]  Donald Trump was just named as the Republican nominee.
[00:28:15.585 --> 00:28:17.086]  Are you here to endorse Donald Trump?
[00:28:17.507 --> 00:28:17.967]  No, I'm not.
[00:28:18.087 --> 00:28:19.309]  And that would be a terrible mistake.
[00:28:20.009 --> 00:28:23.813]  After all, President Obama engaged himself in British politics
[00:28:23.933 --> 00:28:29.779]  And what do you think a Donald Trump administration would bring, not only to our relationships with our oldest ally, but to the rest of the world?
[00:28:49.392 --> 00:28:50.673]  I think that remains to be seen.
[00:28:50.953 --> 00:29:02.679]  I mean, clearly Trump is fighting on an America First ticket and there's a feeling that maybe the interests of ordinary Americans need putting higher up the food chain than perhaps they've been under the last couple of administrations.
[00:29:03.099 --> 00:29:03.900]  So we'll have to see.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.561]  As far as we're concerned,
[00:29:06.481 --> 00:29:07.862]  I mean, look, let's be honest about it.
[00:29:08.382 --> 00:29:16.104]  You know, the UK and the USA, you know, we are pretty much, we have been for a long time, the closest allies in the world.
[00:29:16.745 --> 00:29:20.386]  You know, we've stood together through some pretty heavy stuff.
[00:29:21.206 --> 00:29:26.028]  And frankly, if we hadn't done that in the 20th century, the world would be a much darker place.
[00:29:26.668 --> 00:29:29.730]  I hope we're somewhere near the front of your queue.
[00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:30.991]  Or line, as you normally say.
[00:29:55.339 --> 00:29:58.781]  Yes, well we were all very excited, stayed up late to celebrate along with you all.
[00:29:59.661 --> 00:30:03.263]  Now, what advice can you offer us here in the U.S.
[00:30:03.343 --> 00:30:08.066]  in regards to open immigration, as well as secret trade deals, any advice?
[00:30:08.706 --> 00:30:16.590]  Well, the immigration thing is different because your chief problem as I see it is actually illegal immigration, whereas ours oddly was legal immigration.
[00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:21.693]  Ours was the entire European Union being able to come to our country, but you know,
[00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:23.971]  The lessons are the same.
[00:30:24.411 --> 00:30:32.079]  Unless your citizens feel that you as a government are in control and have a strategy, then they will become contemptuous of you.
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.062]  So, different reasons, but similar result.
[00:30:35.402 --> 00:30:36.724]  And this stuff does matter to people.
[00:30:36.764 --> 00:30:38.265]  It matters to people hugely.
[00:30:38.285 --> 00:30:40.187]  Okay, and one last question.
[00:30:40.508 --> 00:30:43.030]  You bravely led Britain out of the EU.
[00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.554]  Do you think that Donald Trump could lead that type of resistance here in the US?
[00:30:49.153 --> 00:30:50.133]  That's for you to judge.
[00:30:50.514 --> 00:30:51.854]  I don't know the answer to that.
[00:30:51.994 --> 00:31:01.818]  I mean, clearly, clearly, you know, he has taken on the establishment in Washington and inside his own party.
[00:31:01.958 --> 00:31:05.540]  And I'm going to be fascinated to see tomorrow what he's got to say.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.481]  And how he says it too.
[00:31:11.605 --> 00:31:13.246]  Can you just walk away?
[00:31:13.566 --> 00:31:17.008]  This is the nature of Donald Trump protesters.
[00:31:17.048 --> 00:31:18.348]  They have zero intellect.
[00:31:18.368 --> 00:31:20.630]  They have zero depth to their points.
[00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:28.854]  When you try to challenge them to a debate, they give you the middle finger and they walk away.
[00:31:29.734 --> 00:31:30.654]  This happens every time.
[00:31:30.935 --> 00:31:33.256]  I've been exposing this all week.
[00:31:34.945 --> 00:31:41.009]  Do you have any evidence that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong?
[00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:45.411]  And if you did, would she still be in this election?
[00:31:55.677 --> 00:31:56.377]  Let me finish.
[00:32:18.628 --> 00:32:23.270]  She was cleared of that, and because you have no data on Benghazi or the email?
[00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.391]  I have no data on Benghazi except for dead Americans!
[00:32:26.431 --> 00:32:29.592]  No data on Benghazi except for dead Americans!
[00:32:29.892 --> 00:32:32.533]  John McCain is the war hero, isn't he?
[00:32:32.733 --> 00:32:34.013]  McCain the insane!
[00:32:34.113 --> 00:32:35.493]  McCain the insane!
[00:32:35.513 --> 00:32:36.074]  Debate that!
[00:32:36.114 --> 00:32:38.254]  John McCain is the war hero!
[00:32:38.354 --> 00:32:40.635]  What idiot said that?
[00:32:40.675 --> 00:32:41.896]  What idiot said that?
[00:32:43.476 --> 00:32:45.917]  His father was an admiral.
[00:33:02.529 --> 00:33:07.992]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.532 --> 00:33:09.033]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.433 --> 00:33:12.494]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.175 --> 00:33:13.635]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.835 --> 00:33:16.437]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.737 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.857 --> 00:33:18.798]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.686]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.026 --> 00:36:46.687]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.888 --> 00:36:53.009]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.

[00:37:17.844 --> 00:37:25.088]  And that was a video of Ted Cruz as he was booed off the stage at the RNC convention, and this is when he refused to endorse Donald Trump.
[00:37:25.488 --> 00:37:34.193]  Now, Cruz said one of the reasons he doesn't support Trump is because Trump, I guess, insulted his family, talked about his wife or about his father.
[00:37:34.213 --> 00:37:40.637]  And while I do not encourage those things, I know that those things are rather common when you get into the election cycle.
[00:37:40.817 --> 00:37:43.739]  He says, go with your conscience, and when you think about it,
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:52.948]  Many people are in the left-right paradigm, which would say, go with your conscience, go with Hillary Clinton, and why he would endorse her over Trump is a far mystery to me.
[00:37:52.968 --> 00:38:04.339]  I guess you could also talk about other guys like Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party, but I think he was referring to Mrs. Clinton when he made that statement, and he's saying she's going to be better for the country, and as a Republican,
[00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:06.020]  Him being a Republican, not myself.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:13.706]  I was very surprised and shocked to hear him say that, but I really think we've learned a lot about Ted Cruz here in the past year.
[00:38:13.926 --> 00:38:15.327]  Previously, he had done a lot of good stuff.
[00:38:15.347 --> 00:38:28.337]  He talked about the Federal Reserve and other things I liked about the guy, but when it came down to the brass tacks, you know, he couldn't be bothered to show up for a vote for the Federal Reserve, many other things as well, and that's just who Ted Cruz is.
[00:38:28.778 --> 00:38:32.040]  Now, earlier in our broadcast, Derren McBreen brought you a lot of news.
[00:38:33.021 --> 00:38:59.762]  about attacks on police officers and I'll touch on one here a very deliberate attack in Australia and they said basically somebody filled up a vehicle full of gas bottles and they drove the car inside the police station to a parking garage but the car did not explode they're saying it's still under investigation and they'll get to the bottom of it try to figure out exactly what the guy was up to it was put out there that it may have been a terror attack you know in the conventional
[00:39:00.362 --> 00:39:04.365]  Thought of a terror attack, but BBC pointed out there's no official confirmation.
[00:39:04.725 --> 00:39:06.566]  So we'll keep an eye on that as things develop.
[00:39:06.947 --> 00:39:12.430]  Now, with that in mind, we definitely know that police have a very dangerous job, a very thankless job.
[00:39:13.611 --> 00:39:18.354]  While we do see the very unfortunate things that the police do, oftentimes we don't see the good things that they do.
[00:39:18.414 --> 00:39:25.099]  You know, we don't see them helping old ladies across the street or getting the cat out the tree or, you know, walking kids home in a bad neighborhood.
[00:39:25.139 --> 00:39:26.279]  We oftentimes see the bad.
[00:39:26.299 --> 00:39:30.082]  So you have to be conscious of the good and the bad, but you also don't
[00:39:31.023 --> 00:39:31.524]  I don't know.
[00:39:44.845 --> 00:39:46.366]  He is a service worker.
[00:39:46.426 --> 00:39:47.806]  He works with autistic people.
[00:39:48.426 --> 00:39:56.529]  He had one of his patients wander out of the group home and out into the streets the gentleman, the autistic gentleman, had a toy truck.
[00:39:56.809 --> 00:40:00.130]  He was walking around the neighborhood and people called in saying this guy was toying a gun.
[00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:06.132]  And this is what really concerned me because people always want to talk about the open carriers and all this stuff.
[00:40:07.592 --> 00:40:25.250]  It's really not the issue, because when you have people that are carrying a toy truck, or we've seen schools get shut down because people had umbrellas, or kids getting kicked out of school because they're playing with colorful orange and green Nerf guns in their front yard, it's not the open carriers who are doing this stuff, it's how people respond to it.
[00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:26.951]  Open carry is a completely different thing.
[00:40:27.132 --> 00:40:29.154]  But basically, back to the story of Charles here.
[00:40:30.495 --> 00:40:33.818]  He was lying on the ground with his hands up in the air.
[00:40:33.838 --> 00:40:34.839]  You know, hands up, don't you?
[00:40:35.259 --> 00:40:40.443]  Laying prone on his back, had his hands in the air, talking to the cops, talking also to his patient.
[00:40:40.483 --> 00:40:43.826]  He's telling the patient, please get down on the ground, put your hands down.
[00:40:43.866 --> 00:40:45.528]  The guy's being uncooperative.
[00:40:46.168 --> 00:40:50.532]  And lo and behold, a police officer flies off around and shoots him in the leg.
[00:40:50.792 --> 00:40:52.853]  Now there are many different videos of this.
[00:40:53.033 --> 00:40:55.615]  Every single one I saw doesn't show the shooting itself.
[00:40:55.675 --> 00:40:59.698]  It shows Charles before the shooting and after shooting after they have him handcuffed.
[00:40:59.718 --> 00:41:02.240]  So if there's a video out there, you can put it in the description.
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.181]  I'll be happy to look at it.
[00:41:03.962 --> 00:41:07.484]  But Charles says he was shot in the leg and he talked to the officer.
[00:41:07.544 --> 00:41:08.885]  These are the words of Charles.
[00:41:09.186 --> 00:41:10.567]  He says, why did you shoot me?
[00:41:10.587 --> 00:41:13.048]  And the officer responds, I don't know.
[00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:27.861]  That is just beyond comprehension how you can have a guy who's being so compliant, trying to be so polite, having a good sense of communication with the officers and the officers shoot him anyway because they're just so on edge.
[00:41:28.721 --> 00:41:31.544]  And that's by no means an excuse for what the officers did.
[00:41:32.164 --> 00:41:40.091]  The officer definitely needs to be reprimanded and I'd say flat out he needs to lose his job if you will shoot a guy unarmed on the ground with his hands up.
[00:41:40.111 --> 00:41:41.612]  There is no excuse for that.
[00:41:42.052 --> 00:41:42.553]  We're good to go.
[00:42:03.351 --> 00:42:11.959]  Now, let's talk about something that's going on overseas, and I hear these stories rather often, and to an extent, I always thought they were kind of old wives tales.
[00:42:11.979 --> 00:42:16.844]  Like, you don't go to that country, they don't have these self-defense like we have here in the United States.
[00:42:16.864 --> 00:42:21.608]  And I'm not just talking about the right to bear arms, I'm talking about self-defense in general, where they would arrest you.
[00:42:21.628 --> 00:42:24.791]  And I hear people, I even heard Alex talk, I'm like, come on Alex, it can't be that bad.
[00:42:25.212 --> 00:42:26.393]  Well, it is that bad.
[00:42:26.953 --> 00:42:27.874]  We have a story here.
[00:42:28.274 --> 00:42:30.055]  Four years in jail, damages.
[00:42:30.495 --> 00:42:34.818]  Finnish man sentenced for defending home against invasion.
[00:42:35.418 --> 00:42:36.639]  And this is back in April.
[00:42:36.659 --> 00:42:39.761]  A 35 year old man heard a knock on his door and went to open it.
[00:42:40.261 --> 00:42:44.644]  And in rushed three intruders holding baseball bats and a gun.
[00:42:45.464 --> 00:42:52.148]  The man, the homeowner, then retreated to his kitchen where he found a knife and was able to fight off the intruders, two men and one woman.
[00:42:52.288 --> 00:42:53.369]  So I want you to picture this.
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.441]  Three people rushing to your house.
[00:42:56.461 --> 00:42:59.122]  One of them has a gun, at least one of them has a baseball bat.
[00:42:59.282 --> 00:43:00.562]  They're in there, you know, fighting you.
[00:43:00.602 --> 00:43:01.523]  You go, you grab a knife.
[00:43:01.583 --> 00:43:05.244]  You fight off three people armed with a gun and a baseball bat.
[00:43:05.604 --> 00:43:10.746]  Now, I would say if that happened here in the United States of America, I'd say, hey, that's a great guy.
[00:43:10.766 --> 00:43:12.047]  He went in there, he whooped them up.
[00:43:12.627 --> 00:43:14.367]  He's defending his home, his castle.
[00:43:16.148 --> 00:43:23.055]  In violation of anything, thus in my opinion, because you hear stories here in the United States, well, maybe you chase the guy down the street and you shoot him in the back.
[00:43:23.335 --> 00:43:23.936]  You can't do that.
[00:43:24.096 --> 00:43:25.157]  But this guy wasn't doing that.
[00:43:25.197 --> 00:43:25.918]  He was in his home.
[00:43:25.938 --> 00:43:27.059]  He was in his castle.
[00:43:27.079 --> 00:43:28.921]  He picked up a weapon to defend himself.
[00:43:29.261 --> 00:43:34.226]  And now he is getting a tougher sentence than the people who actually invaded his home.
[00:43:34.686 --> 00:43:40.072]  And the homeowner has been convicted of excessive self-defense and attempted manslaughter.
[00:43:40.612 --> 00:43:46.334]  He will serve an unconditional sentence of four years and two months, which he will spend in prison.
[00:43:46.694 --> 00:43:49.915]  He's also been paid, will pay damages to his attackers.
[00:43:49.955 --> 00:44:02.499]  So these people broke into his home, they attacked him in his home, they used a gun on him in his home, brandished a gun on him in his home, brandished a baseball bat on him in his home, and because he picked up a knife, he has to pay them $23,000.
[00:44:05.555 --> 00:44:08.296]  Does that make sense to anybody who's listening to this?
[00:44:08.657 --> 00:44:11.558]  And these are the type of laws people have to deal with overseas.
[00:44:11.658 --> 00:44:22.824]  But, to tell you what happened to the home invaders, all three received a one-year and two-months conditional sentence, which is similar to probation in Finland.
[00:44:23.204 --> 00:44:25.265]  And they've also been ordered to pay the homeowner $3,300.
[00:44:28.956 --> 00:44:31.817]  They have to pay him $3,300, but he has to pay them $23,000.
[00:44:32.138 --> 00:44:40.822]  He has to pay them $20,000 for breaking into his house with weapons, with a gun and a baseball bat.
[00:44:40.862 --> 00:44:42.183]  But the homeowner has to pay them.
[00:44:42.503 --> 00:44:50.247]  And this is the kind of backwards logic that we see going on in the world today, where if you defend yourself, they say something's wrong with you.
[00:44:50.267 --> 00:44:52.708]  I was actually watching one of those judge shows.
[00:44:53.128 --> 00:44:54.349]  There's a million of them.
[00:44:55.169 --> 00:45:01.631]  Basically this guy, he was out somewhere and some guys were trying to get rough with his wife, with his girlfriend or whatever, so he takes them on.
[00:45:01.811 --> 00:45:05.932]  And then the judge is talking down to the guy who was defending his wife.
[00:45:06.232 --> 00:45:08.233]  He's like, well you're not a tough guy, you should just let them do it.
[00:45:08.273 --> 00:45:11.354]  He's like, so I'm just supposed to stand there as these people attack my wife?
[00:45:11.714 --> 00:45:16.255]  No, the guy was like, he wasn't, you know, UFC fighting, he wasn't Tim Kennedy or anything like that.
[00:45:16.635 --> 00:45:19.816]  The guy said he did a little bit of wrestling in high school or college or whatever and
[00:45:20.316 --> 00:45:23.758]  He knew a little bit to defend himself, and he actually did defend himself.
[00:45:23.798 --> 00:45:28.140]  And the judge wants to, you know, point the finger at him, like, you should just let him steal your purse and smack your wife.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.581]  And I'm like, what is this mentality here?
[00:45:31.081 --> 00:45:39.306]  And not just in the United States, but in the world, this curl up in a ball, safe space, do whatever you want to me, just not in the face kind of mentality.
[00:45:39.886 --> 00:45:42.587]  So that's my rant on that, and that is the News Blitz for the day.
[00:45:42.807 --> 00:45:45.829]  I'm Jakari Jackson reporting from the InfoWars Command Center.
[00:45:55.103 --> 00:45:58.585]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:45:58.765 --> 00:46:02.068]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:46:02.108 --> 00:46:06.931]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:46:07.071 --> 00:46:09.653]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:46:09.953 --> 00:46:14.216]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule.
[00:46:14.796 --> 00:46:15.998]  Actions that we take.
[00:46:16.118 --> 00:46:19.702]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:46:20.142 --> 00:46:22.725]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:46:22.825 --> 00:46:31.355]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:46:32.384 --> 00:46:41.131]  ...is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:46:41.231 --> 00:46:46.375]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:46:46.896 --> 00:46:50.479]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:46:50.659 --> 00:46:52.680]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.182]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:46:55.242 --> 00:46:57.624]  Know your history and you will know your enemy.
[00:46:57.964 --> 00:46:59.085]  InfoWars.com
[00:47:00.742 --> 00:47:02.863]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!

[00:47:18.428 --> 00:47:22.050]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:28.495]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of brain force.
[00:47:43.544 --> 00:47:48.327]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.427 --> 00:47:50.488]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:52.569]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.

[00:48:04.796 --> 00:48:08.198]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.559 --> 00:48:15.683]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.304 --> 00:48:24.629]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:29.072]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.332 --> 00:48:34.616]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:48:34.636 --> 00:48:35.497]  We're good to go.
[00:49:07.987 --> 00:49:11.688]  The 2016 RNC has gone completely as expected.
[00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:15.509]  Communist anti-Trump protesters attacking Alex Jones.
[00:49:15.529 --> 00:49:28.633]  We are here to tell George Soros and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and the rest of the globalists, you're not going to start a civil war in this country!
[00:49:28.834 --> 00:49:29.494]  Nazi scum!
[00:49:29.514 --> 00:49:29.774]  Nazi scum!
[00:49:29.834 --> 00:49:30.654]  Nazi scum!
[00:49:30.814 --> 00:49:31.474]  Nazi scum!
[00:49:31.634 --> 00:49:32.975]  Nazi scum!
[00:49:33.075 --> 00:49:33.435]  Nazi scum!
[00:49:34.744 --> 00:49:42.409]  The burning of the American flag that resulted in charring the anti-American scum that lit old glory up in the first place.
[00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:43.289]  You're on fire!
[00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:45.670]  You're on fire, stupid!
[00:49:45.971 --> 00:50:01.760]  Anti-Trump protesters throwing human waste on the police, a mysterious bomb threat after a garbage truck was stolen, and lying Ted Cruz's career-killing primetime non-endorsement of Donald Trump's GOP presidential nomination.
[00:50:03.553 --> 00:50:21.543]  The case we have to make to the American people, the case each person in this room has to make to the American people, is to commit to each of them that we will defend freedom and be faithful to the Constitution.
[00:50:24.252 --> 00:50:33.217]  We will unite the party, we will unite the country by standing together for shared values, by standing for liberty.
[00:50:33.918 --> 00:50:40.202]  God bless each and every one of you, and God bless the United States of America.
[00:50:41.198 --> 00:50:44.859]  But then the crowd was getting kind of restless and they started chanting, Endorse Trump!
[00:50:45.319 --> 00:50:46.099]  Endorse Trump!
[00:50:46.559 --> 00:50:47.259]  Endorse Trump!
[00:50:47.299 --> 00:50:58.602]  And he just kept forging ahead with his pre-planned speech and he did not stick to what he said that he was going to do when he made that pledge to the RNC that he would endorse the candidate no matter who it was.
[00:50:59.202 --> 00:51:02.843]  And now he officially is lying Ted, I guess.
[00:51:03.283 --> 00:51:04.083]  Joe Biggs, what do you think?
[00:51:04.443 --> 00:51:16.987]  Yeah, so back when this whole thing, this whole race for the White House took off, every candidate had to come out and sign a pledge saying, you know what, if I lose, I will endorse the Republican nomination, stand behind that guy to help unify the party.
[00:51:17.347 --> 00:51:21.989]  You know, Ted Cruz walks out, like you said earlier, he hit all the points that Trump's been making.
[00:51:22.469 --> 00:51:29.832]  Stronger security, stronger, you know, border security, military, you know, more jobs for the American people, all the things that we want.
[00:51:30.552 --> 00:51:38.076]  But then he says we need to unify the party and he basically just almost like drops the mic and walks off without even coming out and officially going, you know what?
[00:51:38.176 --> 00:51:38.877]  I'm Ted Cruz.
[00:51:39.257 --> 00:51:40.057]  I'm behind Trump.
[00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:41.138]  You should be behind Trump.
[00:51:41.418 --> 00:51:42.138]  Let's unify.
[00:51:42.178 --> 00:51:42.759]  Let's come together.
[00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:43.779]  Let's beat Hillary Clinton.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.482]  Now here's a look at some of the more accepted speeches at the RNC.
[00:51:48.902 --> 00:51:57.044]  They're afraid of free speech, and that's what they always try to do, is come and disrupt people and take over their free speech.
[00:51:57.084 --> 00:51:58.665]  These are not liberals!
[00:51:59.025 --> 00:52:04.766]  These are anti-free speech, anti-freedom sit-ins who need to get their asses to work for free!
[00:52:04.846 --> 00:52:17.550]  Now, one of the things that I have learned about Hillary Clinton is that one of her heroes, her mentors, was Saul Alinsky.
[00:52:22.669 --> 00:52:25.912]  And her senior thesis was about Saul Alinsky.
[00:52:26.612 --> 00:52:34.177]  This was someone that she greatly admired and that affected all of her philosophies subsequently.
[00:52:34.898 --> 00:52:38.441]  Now, interestingly enough, let me tell you something about Saul Alinsky.
[00:52:38.981 --> 00:52:41.323]  He wrote a book called Rules for Radicals.
[00:52:42.403 --> 00:52:51.090]  On the dedication page, it acknowledges Lucifer, the original radical who gained his own kingdom.
[00:52:51.874 --> 00:52:52.955]  Now think about that.
[00:52:53.616 --> 00:53:02.485]  This is a nation where our founding document, the Declaration of Independence, talks about certain inalienable rights that come from our Creator.
[00:53:03.406 --> 00:53:11.015]  This is a nation where our Pledge of Allegiance says we are one nation under God.
[00:53:12.056 --> 00:53:13.838]  This is a nation
[00:53:17.867 --> 00:53:26.015]  This is a nation where every coin in our pocket and every bill in our wallet says, in God we trust.
[00:53:26.556 --> 00:53:34.905]  I think it's important to say that we've got to make sure that the hell the veterans return from is not the hell to come home to, okay?
[00:53:40.401 --> 00:53:48.208]  Hillary Clinton putting big government spending financed by the Chinese ahead of good paying jobs for middle class Americans.
[00:53:48.588 --> 00:53:50.510]  Is she guilty or not guilty?
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:54:08.348]  Of course, Melania Trump's faux plagiarism got more airtime scrutiny by the mainstream media than the federal government's corruption displayed by the DOJ and the FBI over Hillary Clinton's clear criminal abuse of the United States national security.
[00:54:08.628 --> 00:54:17.213]  Donald Trump will be making the speech of his life tonight after experiencing the invigorating palatable anger displayed at the RNC.
[00:54:18.857 --> 00:54:21.019]  Do you know who's taking money from Big Pharma?
[00:54:21.119 --> 00:54:21.500]  Hillary!
[00:54:30.509 --> 00:54:42.077]  The rage against the global Clinton Foundation self-serving machine, the Constitution-killing Obama administration, and the awareness of the underlying emerging New World Order system.
[00:54:42.337 --> 00:54:49.802]  What I've seen is several decades of big politics, big government, treating democracy with contempt.
[00:54:50.342 --> 00:54:53.545]  A glimpse of the resurrection of the wounded, yet inexorable, Republic of the United States of America.
[00:55:20.106 --> 00:55:21.106]  So is this an insurrection?
[00:55:21.547 --> 00:55:21.767]  Yes!
[00:55:22.067 --> 00:55:23.007]  It's not an insurrection!
[00:55:23.247 --> 00:55:26.568]  It's a correction!
[00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:34.231]  I'm Ashley Beckford reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:55:34.571 --> 00:55:44.094]  I'm out on the streets of Austin, Texas today to find out if people actually want to give up American sovereignty and go into a communist, totalitarian world government.
[00:55:44.394 --> 00:55:45.895]  Let's see what Austinites have to say.
[00:55:46.275 --> 00:55:47.835]  We're never going to become a communist country.
[00:55:48.396 --> 00:55:49.116]  There's no chance.
[00:55:49.716 --> 00:55:50.136]  We aren't?
[00:55:50.237 --> 00:55:51.478]  We're always going to be a capitalist country.
[00:55:51.578 --> 00:55:52.539]  We're built on capitalism.
[00:55:52.699 --> 00:56:01.807]  People think that America should become a communist country, a communist-run state, or should we stick with the capitalism and the Constitution?
[00:56:01.827 --> 00:56:04.690]  I don't want to comment, actually.
[00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:05.150]  You don't?
[00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:06.571]  Yeah, I just was curious.
[00:56:06.912 --> 00:56:09.174]  Do you think America should become a communist state?
[00:56:10.715 --> 00:56:10.935]  No.
[00:56:12.036 --> 00:56:12.416]  Why not?
[00:56:13.758 --> 00:56:15.479]  I think it's okay if it was a
[00:56:17.435 --> 00:56:25.379]  If a majority of the people wanted to have a communist system, if it was a democracy, then yeah, it should be people choose.
[00:56:25.719 --> 00:56:32.323]  I'm out here asking people today if they think that America should be a communist country or a capitalist country.
[00:56:33.644 --> 00:56:34.324]  A capitalist.
[00:56:35.845 --> 00:56:39.747]  I'm not for the communist thing.
[00:56:40.828 --> 00:56:41.588]  Why not?
[00:56:41.608 --> 00:56:44.830]  I think that we should be able to have freedom of choice.
[00:56:45.717 --> 00:56:47.458]  To work and do what we want, when we want.
[00:56:47.979 --> 00:56:49.500]  I'm not from here, I'm from Australia.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:53.984]  Okay, so are you a fan of communism or capitalism?
[00:56:54.024 --> 00:56:55.485]  What do you think America should be?
[00:56:57.046 --> 00:56:58.387]  Keep it the way it is.
[00:56:58.467 --> 00:57:00.169]  Why would you want to be a communist country?
[00:57:01.249 --> 00:57:17.913]  At the basis of what communism is, it's going through the same problems I think of what we're going through now, where you have a select few that control a lot of what we have in our lives, whether that's food resources, energy allocation, you have a select few that controls that for the rest of the population, which I'm very much against.
[00:57:18.113 --> 00:57:27.255]  And I think that in regards to communism, if you look at history, which has proven to be substantial facts, it has not worked in most societies.
[00:57:28.175 --> 00:57:30.116]  So I think that because of that, any
[00:57:31.644 --> 00:57:40.212]  Any sort of one way source of thinking of like, oh, only communism works, I think that's flawed.
[00:57:40.232 --> 00:57:44.577]  And I think that we have the evidence to determine that it doesn't work.
[00:57:45.357 --> 00:57:55.147]  And I think that we have to focus on what has happened in the past in order to kind of be able to reroute what's going to happen.
[00:57:55.467 --> 00:57:56.368]  So there you have it.
[00:57:56.488 --> 00:58:03.435]  I'm really surprised that when I came out here, half the people don't care or know what political system America is under.
[00:58:03.775 --> 00:58:05.157]  So that's really ridiculous.
[00:58:05.898 --> 00:58:12.044]  Coming from the fact that there are people out here with the revolutionary communists who are actually burning American flags.
[00:58:12.344 --> 00:58:17.028]  And saying that they want to create a revolutionary communist society right here in America.
[00:58:17.429 --> 00:58:24.635]  So what we need to do is stand up and make sure that people know about these revolutionary communists and know what socialism brings.
[00:58:24.955 --> 00:58:25.796]  It's never worked.
[00:58:25.856 --> 00:58:27.017]  It's never going to work.
[00:58:27.317 --> 00:58:31.741]  And Venezuela is a perfect modern example of how socialism is not working.
[00:58:32.041 --> 00:58:35.304]  Do you want to pay, you know, $150 for a loaf of bread?
[00:58:35.665 --> 00:58:38.247]  If you do, then move to Venezuela because we don't want you here.
[00:58:38.827 --> 00:58:41.250]  I'm Ashley Beckford for InfoWars.com.
[00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:43.153]  Please stay tuned for more special reports.
