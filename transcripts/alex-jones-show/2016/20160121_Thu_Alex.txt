[00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.631]  News this hour from townhall.com.
[00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:16.156]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:17.857]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.597 --> 00:00:19.698]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:21.159]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:22.899]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.122]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:31.744]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.524 --> 00:00:37.790]  Welcome to this Thursday, the 21st day of January 2016 transmission.
[00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.214]  We have another powerful John Bowne report coming up in T-minus one minute.
[00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:49.162]  On El Chapo and the .50 caliber rifle supplied to him by Barack Hussein Obama and the false flag attack.
[00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:51.003]  That is fast and furious.
[00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:52.183]  That's coming up.
[00:00:52.503 --> 00:00:58.486]  They're trying to blame Putin right now publicly for a radioactive poisoning death a few years ago.
[00:00:58.906 --> 00:01:00.046]  Things are ratcheting up there.
[00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:04.188]  The New York Times says America's best days may be behind it now.
[00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:10.191]  Taking a line from a Merle Haggard song, headed downhill like a snowball headed for hell.
[00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:17.632]  We've also got the State Department basically admitting Mexico is in a state of open collapse in many areas.
[00:01:18.092 --> 00:01:19.833]  And so is the United States.
[00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.893]  So we've got travel warnings out there.
[00:01:22.273 --> 00:01:24.933]  Huge developments on the campaign trail with Trump.
[00:01:25.213 --> 00:01:36.815]  And globally, high atop a mountain in Davos, the global elite fear Donald Trump and openly are scheming on how to derail him and get an establishment candidate in like Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton.
[00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:37.856]  It's all coming up.
[00:01:38.136 --> 00:01:38.976]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:39.556]  Stay with us.
[00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:41.498]  Where's El Chapo?
[00:01:42.178 --> 00:01:49.127]  The billionaire head of the Sinaloa drug cartel and the second most powerful man in Mexico after Carlos Slim.
[00:01:49.468 --> 00:01:56.657]  Well, he is sitting in the Altiplano prison after a raid on January 8th at a Los Mochis residence in northern Sinaloa.
[00:01:56.937 --> 00:01:59.100]  The raid netted two armored cars.
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.222]  Two M16 rifles with grenade launchers and two Barrett M82 sniper rifles.
[00:02:05.682 --> 00:02:21.988]  Fox News reported, when agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives checked serial numbers of the eight weapons found in his possession, they found one of the two .50 caliber weapons traced back to the ATF program, sources said.
[00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:27.290]  Out of the roughly 2,000 weapons sold through Fast and Furious, 34 were .50 caliber rifles.
[00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:30.512]  That can take down a helicopter.
[00:02:30.772 --> 00:02:38.398]  El Chapo would put his guardsmen on hilltops to be on guard for Mexican police helicopters that would fly through valleys conducting raids.
[00:02:38.738 --> 00:02:42.221]  The sole purpose of the guardsmen would be to shoot down those helicopters.
[00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:49.766]  This is the third time a weapon from the Fast and Furious program has been found at a high-profile Mexican crime scene.
[00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:50.846]  Now, the U.S.
[00:02:50.906 --> 00:02:57.428]  Department of Justice, under the direction of Loretta Lynch, is in the middle of an extradition battle waged by U.S.
[00:02:57.468 --> 00:03:01.709]  attorney offices in New York, Chicago, Miami, El Paso, and San Diego.
[00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:18.233]  While Lynch, whose office, under former DOJ head Eric Holder, committed the first case of criminal and civil contempt of Congress due to his responsibility for aiding and abetting the very drug lord Lynch claims to intend to prosecute.
[00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:19.513]  But Holder isn't in a
[00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:20.193]  I don't think so.
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.221]  They just can't help themselves.
[00:03:38.661 --> 00:03:49.327]  Back in jolly old England, mega-corporate criminal Stuart Gulliver, who admitted in 2012 to laundering hundreds of millions of dollars for El Chapo's Sinaloa drug cartel.
[00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:58.113]  Whereas Gulliver, after the deaths of 100,000 plus and 20,000 missing Mexicans, were funded by the monumental $376 billion of drug money HSBC handled for Wachovia,
[00:04:02.455 --> 00:04:18.750]  Gulliver is currently at the Davos Confab, still operating as the group chief executive of HSBC, making decisions with 61 other criminal billionaires determining the amount of carbon taxes they will be fleecing from the unsuspecting populace.
[00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.613]  The Telegraph writes, Mr. Gulliver is on a panel on business and climate change.
[00:04:23.873 --> 00:04:35.721]  He appears largely supportive of the COP21 decree agreed at Paris in December, but says there cannot be a binary moment when everyone drops oil in gas companies.
[00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:45.545]  And Guardian journalist Jill Traynor tweets, Gulliver warns Davos of pulling out of all fossil fuel investments as they are providers of jobs and taxes.
[00:04:46.025 --> 00:04:52.948]  And Gulliver also says, the maths do work when asked about financing of green fuel at Davos.
[00:04:53.448 --> 00:04:58.210]  The public wants to do this, according to global mafia chief Stuart Gulliver.
[00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.332]  As El Chapo sits in a maximum security prison, he has already escaped.
[00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:09.132]  He embodies the mentality of a global criminal organization goliath that protects... That's right!
[00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:11.430]  Who do you prefer?
[00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.952]  Barack Obama or George W. Bush?
[00:05:15.332 --> 00:05:20.255]  Well, if you haven't figured it out by now, these guys are corporate spokesmen.
[00:05:20.295 --> 00:05:21.096]  They're not leaders.
[00:05:21.356 --> 00:05:23.677]  I mean, they both started illegal wars.
[00:05:23.998 --> 00:05:25.599]  Hell, they both tortured people.
[00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:29.441]  They bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you.
[00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:33.984]  They both violated the Constitution and they even committed war crimes.
[00:05:34.324 --> 00:05:35.225]  So what's it gonna take?
[00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:37.946]  I mean, what will it take to finally wake you up?
[00:05:38.226 --> 00:05:38.787]  Think about it.
[00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:47.992]  If Joseph Stalin ran for president as a Democrat, and Adolf Hitler ran as a Republican, one of them would end up leading our country.
[00:05:48.313 --> 00:05:50.254]  It's politics incorporated.
[00:05:50.494 --> 00:05:53.896]  And your choice between the two parties is a myth.
[00:05:54.096 --> 00:05:58.859]  Because in reality, it is a two-party tyranny with one ideology.
[00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:00.460]  Divide and conquer.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.404]  So join the revolution and break the false left versus right paradigm.

[00:08:21.365 --> 00:08:26.490]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:29.273]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:08:50.851 --> 00:08:57.235]  My friends, we are kicking off another global transmission on this Thursday, 21st day of January 2016.
[00:08:57.315 --> 00:09:00.496]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:09:02.558 --> 00:09:10.002]  Every few days, or every week or so, there is a major theme that emerges in the news.
[00:09:10.522 --> 00:09:13.984]  And it can come from the new media, the alternative media, or the dinosaur media.
[00:09:16.638 --> 00:09:27.226]  In the last few weeks, they've had the theme that, oh, we're growing humanoids inside farm animals and harvesting their organs, but we're not going to show it to you, it's quasi-secret.
[00:09:29.688 --> 00:09:32.631]  And then there's no debate about, do these creatures have rights?
[00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:44.060]  Is there biological species problems here, giving rise to zoological viruses and bacteria, which we know there is.
[00:09:45.956 --> 00:09:50.238]  And so it just comes out for a week or two and then it just blows over and now it's just accepted.
[00:09:51.619 --> 00:09:53.240]  There's no cultural resistance.
[00:09:57.102 --> 00:10:04.166]  And now they've gone in the last really month, there's been another theme that's intensifying this week, that you know what, there is a global depression.
[00:10:04.346 --> 00:10:05.907]  You know what, there is a global collapse.
[00:10:07.167 --> 00:10:10.489]  You know what, America's best days are behind it now.
[00:10:11.229 --> 00:10:14.091]  We're headed downhill like a snowball headed for hell.
[00:10:15.367 --> 00:10:19.301]  With no chance for freedom or to ring the Liberty Bell, to quote Merle Haggard.
[00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:33.636]  And I love how the establishment comes along to tell you we're about to go into a hardcore depression right as it intensifies and then they'll probably give themselves some Peabody Awards, some Pulitzer Prizes or something.
[00:10:34.376 --> 00:10:42.781]  While attacking InfoWars.com and yours truly for telling you about it years ago and telling you exactly what would cause the crisis because it's a foregone conclusion.
[00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:49.445]  The bigger issue is they're going to use these crises now to get even more regulations passed on a little guy
[00:10:50.285 --> 00:10:53.908]  And more banker bailout corporate welfare of our money to them.
[00:10:55.449 --> 00:11:01.313]  They're engineering this financial storm to consolidate control and loot the daylights out of us.
[00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:02.974]  We're going to go over all of that.
[00:11:05.816 --> 00:11:12.882]  But when you read our best days behind us, they then say, oh, it's because there's not enough taxes, not enough regulations.
[00:11:12.902 --> 00:11:15.544]  That's what Davos said five years ago.
[00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:24.496]  We need, that's the public Bilderberg group meeting now ongoing high atop a mountain until this weekend there in Davos, Switzerland.
[00:11:25.377 --> 00:11:33.608]  We need a hundred trillion dollars every decade of a new global currency so that we can save the world and give you jobs.
[00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:43.921]  And it's a hundred trillion backed by carbon taxes, currency taxes, wire transfer taxes, credit card usage taxes.
[00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:46.543]  It's just raping you in the cashless society.
[00:11:46.823 --> 00:11:51.947]  Once they've got you in the cashless society, they can charge you five, ten dollars every time you use your card.
[00:11:52.288 --> 00:11:54.769]  They can charge you when you transfer your paycheck into your account.
[00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.031]  They can regulate and track everything you do.
[00:11:57.271 --> 00:12:02.675]  They can end underground economies that are essential during tyrannical economies just to survive.
[00:12:03.732 --> 00:12:06.156]  This is a scientific takeover.
[00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:15.550]  Sure enough, the main push is global government and class warfare and saving the poor.
[00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:18.234]  This from the top
[00:12:19.827 --> 00:12:21.388]  Micron percent.
[00:12:21.788 --> 00:12:22.509]  We've done the math.
[00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:33.995]  If there's 6,000 superclass in the world, according to Henry Kissinger and Rothkopf and the Kissinger Group, which I agree with, that's top technicians, top billionaires, and then above them just a few families that control that.
[00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:39.899]  If you add 6,000 people and then say they have half the wealth of the planet,
[00:12:41.499 --> 00:12:46.263]  And you divide that out, the numbers, I forget, was it nine or ten zeros?
[00:12:46.824 --> 00:12:53.010]  Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, and then I think it was two, three.
[00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.431]  But you can do the math.
[00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:59.055]  I mean, you can look at different estimations of world wealth and then just divide 6,000 people.
[00:13:00.056 --> 00:13:07.083]  But we'll first cut that wealth in half and then divide that number 6,000 into that, and then you get a basic
[00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:09.469]  Percentage point.
[00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:10.430]  We're not talking about the 1%.
[00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:11.870]  We're not talking about the 2%.
[00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:16.932]  The 1% are the people that own a big boat at the harbor.
[00:13:17.192 --> 00:13:18.533]  They're the people that get their hair done.
[00:13:18.553 --> 00:13:19.793]  They're the people that buy cars.
[00:13:19.994 --> 00:13:22.494]  They're the people that buy curtains.
[00:13:22.675 --> 00:13:24.635]  They're the people that put their kids through college.
[00:13:25.396 --> 00:13:26.816]  They're the folks that build companies.
[00:13:27.156 --> 00:13:28.657]  They're the drivers of society.
[00:13:28.897 --> 00:13:29.897]  They're the Renaissance.
[00:13:30.298 --> 00:13:33.319]  And let me tell you, they're an endangered species, just like
[00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:35.400]  The Great Plains Buffalo.
[00:13:36.141 --> 00:13:42.927]  Once there were many, now they're down to about a third of what they were in the fifties all over the world from Japan to the U.S.
[00:13:43.267 --> 00:13:45.169]  and soon they'll be gone.
[00:13:46.437 --> 00:13:52.904]  And you'll have a tiny, tiny percentage of people that have basically everything.
[00:13:53.165 --> 00:14:07.101]  And this is in the age of liberalism, the age of high taxes, the age of regulation, the age of Davos and the forums and carbon taxes and just everything should be so good.
[00:14:09.321 --> 00:14:21.187]  And the scholarships, and the tuition, and just all the freebies, and all the goodies, and it just gets worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse.
[00:14:21.507 --> 00:14:24.109]  So, that's the big theme here today.
[00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:25.910]  We've got a bunch of guys coming on, a ton of news.
[00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:37.396]  International intrigue, KGB supposed murders, stealth wars, Leanne McAdoo reporting from the ground in Flint, Michigan.
[00:14:38.812 --> 00:14:39.212]  And more.
[00:14:41.254 --> 00:14:46.137]  But before we do all that, let's just look at the real state of the world.
[00:14:47.618 --> 00:14:52.702]  There is unprecedented exponential wealth capacity with technological developments.
[00:14:54.283 --> 00:15:06.652]  Every time our economy grew to 5, 6, 7 percent, the Federal Reserve would come in and say, it's overheating, we're going to regulate it, we're going to raise interest rates, we're going to do this, we're going to do that.
[00:15:08.291 --> 00:15:10.832]  And everything is maneuvering us into collapse.
[00:15:12.052 --> 00:15:14.253]  And that's what the IMF and World Bank do in third world countries.
[00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:15.953]  That's what they're now doing here.
[00:15:17.574 --> 00:15:24.216]  Mexico is an incredibly gorgeous, wealthy country when it comes to actual resources.
[00:15:24.576 --> 00:15:28.437]  And Mexico has more billionaires because Mexico is a microcosm of America.
[00:15:29.602 --> 00:15:36.523]  Mexico has more billionaires per capita for their 130 million population, or whatever it is right now.
[00:15:36.844 --> 00:15:39.624]  Let's look up the population of Mexico, because it's growing all the time.
[00:15:39.984 --> 00:15:41.524]  And then there's the 60 million here, of course.
[00:15:42.385 --> 00:15:42.685]  U.S.
[00:15:42.745 --> 00:15:58.568]  State Department, police capacity non-existent in Mexican state bordering Texas, and then it goes over all these other states in Texas, or in Mexico, where they say it's completely lawless and the most dangerous country in the world, and don't go there.
[00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:03.448]  Well, it's safe to go to Cancun or a few other controlled zones, but that's it.
[00:16:03.868 --> 00:16:08.531]  Mexico is a fallen, failed state, run by the same criminals.
[00:16:09.491 --> 00:16:16.495]  I mean, it's come out with Wachovia, Wells Fargo, the other big six banks, all running the airplanes, laundering the drug money.
[00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:20.597]  Again, Bloomberg, five years ago, in two years, reported that in 2008 and 2009,
[00:16:24.588 --> 00:16:31.463]  Wachovia and Wells Fargo laundered $378 billion in Mexican drug money in two years.
[00:16:31.723 --> 00:16:33.046]  And that's just two of the big banks.
[00:16:34.775 --> 00:16:35.976]  They ran the airplanes.
[00:16:36.316 --> 00:16:37.376]  They ran the guns.
[00:16:37.857 --> 00:16:42.439]  And then it came out the same airplanes were being used to fly kidnapped people on.
[00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:45.060]  Oh, but the bankers wear suits.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:45.881]  They're nice.
[00:16:46.161 --> 00:16:49.382]  Warren Buffett eats ice cream on TV and plays tennis.
[00:16:49.743 --> 00:16:51.043]  Give me a break.
[00:16:51.884 --> 00:16:53.925]  And now they're going to lock up Al Chapo.
[00:16:54.185 --> 00:16:56.286]  Say goodnight to the bad guy.
[00:16:56.846 --> 00:17:00.628]  And he is a bad guy, but he's nothing compared to these people.
[00:17:00.908 --> 00:17:04.130]  The Sinaloa cartel was the main CIA-driven cartel.
[00:17:04.978 --> 00:17:05.458]  On record.
[00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:08.780]  It's been in the Chicago Tribune, been in the El Paso Times.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.081]  His number two guy got caught extraditing.
[00:17:11.141 --> 00:17:13.663]  He got up in court and said, here's my CIA code name.
[00:17:14.103 --> 00:17:17.205]  And the federal judge goes, whoa, whoa, shut it down.
[00:17:17.305 --> 00:17:20.046]  And then one day later said he is under national security.
[00:17:20.086 --> 00:17:20.787]  He's who he says.
[00:17:21.127 --> 00:17:21.807]  Release him.
[00:17:24.529 --> 00:17:25.209]  Release him.
[00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.711]  Then the feds grabbed him again and took him to some other court.
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:51.241]  So, this is how they operate, this is what they do, and then you catch the government of this degenerate run system with a Barrett 50 Cal, I own the exact Barrett, it's the same Marine Corps or Army version, that's what the field troops use, big, bad, and camo green.
[00:17:54.383 --> 00:17:58.204]  And they found, of course, with illegal weapons like Russian-made RPGs.
[00:17:58.784 --> 00:18:01.644]  Yeah, you don't buy a rocket-propelled grenade at the gun shop.
[00:18:03.325 --> 00:18:04.685]  It's all been illegally gotten.
[00:18:06.065 --> 00:18:11.306]  But they want to blame the Second Amendment, caught in a false flag, CBS News, and it's hardly in the news today.
[00:18:11.326 --> 00:18:20.028]  It comes out, oh, another gun that our government shipped down there to blame the Second Amendment in a frame-up, caught with El Chapo, and then there's nothing else in the news about it today.
[00:18:20.248 --> 00:18:22.408]  It comes out, boom, no more coverage.
[00:18:25.199 --> 00:18:32.471]  Just like we had Louis Farrakhan on in a tell interview about bringing people together, zero, almost zero coverage.
[00:18:34.755 --> 00:18:36.036]  But here's the New York Times.
[00:18:36.816 --> 00:18:38.937]  America's best days may be behind it.
[00:18:39.197 --> 00:18:44.360]  And they have a picture of Mary Tyler Moore looking young and devastatingly good looking.
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.401]  I asked a woman like her in her youth.
[00:18:46.461 --> 00:18:47.802]  That to me is a good looking woman right there.
[00:18:48.402 --> 00:18:49.143]  But I digress.
[00:18:49.563 --> 00:18:50.744]  I'm just admiring God's creatures.
[00:18:51.024 --> 00:18:54.326]  Take a look back at some of the most popular TV programs in the 60s.
[00:18:54.586 --> 00:18:57.607]  The Dick Van Dyke Show, Bewitched, and even Beverly Hillbillies.
[00:18:57.907 --> 00:18:58.528]  And what do you see?
[00:18:59.935 --> 00:19:05.999]  And it goes on to describe all the happiness and all the goodness and then per capita income mirroring what you saw.
[00:19:06.259 --> 00:19:08.641]  But see, that's when men and women worked together.
[00:19:09.321 --> 00:19:12.163]  We've all been taught to fight with each other now and to be losers.
[00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:15.786]  And we have all these regulations and we shipped our jobs to China and India.
[00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:17.427]  We got screwed over.
[00:19:17.687 --> 00:19:18.768]  We trusted the system.
[00:19:18.968 --> 00:19:23.891]  What made America great was not trusting the system and sticking together and having local government.
[00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:25.272]  That's all gone now.
[00:19:26.445 --> 00:19:37.896]  Now we have the big multinational combines and this new video up on InfoWars.com with the BLM bragging, they're in Oregon, about all the quote, money they've stolen.
[00:19:38.036 --> 00:19:40.618]  They say, we've stolen money and land.
[00:19:41.199 --> 00:19:42.520]  And they give each other awards.
[00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:46.504]  You have stolen a lot of money, here's an award.
[00:19:46.804 --> 00:19:48.466]  And they do it in front of cameras.
[00:19:48.906 --> 00:19:49.387]  Why not?
[00:19:51.437 --> 00:19:55.138]  I saw some of the moron commenters and they're going, why is this a repost of a story yesterday?
[00:19:55.478 --> 00:19:56.979]  No, there was an article yesterday.
[00:19:57.019 --> 00:19:59.459]  This is a video report with David Knight.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.160]  And I know the trolls know that.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.421]  I just have to say they're inventing new ways to cause infighting and mindlessness and change the subject.
[00:20:05.701 --> 00:20:06.642]  But people see right through it.
[00:20:06.662 --> 00:20:07.062]  We'll be back.
[00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:07.442]  Stay with us.
[00:20:10.678 --> 00:20:12.059]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.462]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[00:20:15.022 --> 00:20:18.646]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[00:20:18.886 --> 00:20:27.354]  Ten years ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[00:20:27.714 --> 00:20:30.977]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[00:20:31.858 --> 00:20:34.939]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[00:20:34.979 --> 00:20:39.601]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[00:20:40.361 --> 00:20:44.583]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[00:20:45.283 --> 00:20:48.084]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[00:20:48.424 --> 00:20:50.665]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[00:20:51.525 --> 00:20:57.788]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallets, sleeves, or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[00:20:58.548 --> 00:21:03.810]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.831]  It is as though the protection is free.
[00:21:06.531 --> 00:21:08.172]  Visit idstronghold.com today.
[00:21:09.522 --> 00:21:14.504]  Do you have relatives and friends that are convinced there's no need ever to prepare for any kind of emergency?
[00:21:14.744 --> 00:21:17.224]  Are these also folks you buy Christmas presents for?

[00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:18.857]  We use mobile devices right against our bodies every day, but growing scientific evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.
[00:22:18.957 --> 00:22:19.497]  The solution
[00:22:19.517 --> 00:22:20.138]  We're good.

[00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:13.552]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, a crashing economy.
[00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:14.673]  Are you ready?
[00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:17.553]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[00:23:17.653 --> 00:23:19.854]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[00:23:20.034 --> 00:23:23.515]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?
[00:23:23.795 --> 00:23:28.576]  Be wise and be ready with 25-Year Shelf Life Wise Food Storage.

[00:23:50.134 --> 00:23:51.514]  All the leaves are brown, leaves are brown.
[00:24:22.552 --> 00:24:23.832]  We need to be angry.
[00:24:24.052 --> 00:24:25.233]  We need to be upset.
[00:24:25.293 --> 00:24:28.353]  We need to be in the system's face saying, we know you're criminals.
[00:24:30.614 --> 00:24:38.756]  One thing Donald Trump says that is not true, we got the Donald Trump news coming up in the next segment, there's a lot of it, is he says we have stupid leaders.
[00:24:39.456 --> 00:24:40.836]  We have idiot negotiators.
[00:24:40.876 --> 00:24:44.697]  We have people screwing America over, making nothing but bad deals.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:59.743]  No, there have been global combine meetings, many of which have been leaked, many of which Judicial Watch and others have sued and gotten, at these North American Union and other global confabs, where we learn what happens.
[00:25:00.423 --> 00:25:05.725]  Agreements were made to give China rare earth minerals worldwide.
[00:25:05.765 --> 00:25:09.486]  That's why they get 97% of rare earth minerals.
[00:25:09.526 --> 00:25:10.566]  Just a snapshot.
[00:25:11.986 --> 00:25:12.947]  90... Google it!
[00:25:13.007 --> 00:25:13.507]  I'm not kidding.
[00:25:14.477 --> 00:25:18.140]  China gets 97% of rare earth minerals.
[00:25:20.441 --> 00:25:21.162]  If a U.S.
[00:25:21.202 --> 00:25:29.328]  company tries to go anywhere in the world and get rare earth minerals, the federal government sues them, shuts them down, won't let them import it.
[00:25:29.488 --> 00:25:30.729]  That's a whole other scandal.
[00:25:30.949 --> 00:25:32.751]  You think they're just shutting off our coal plants?
[00:25:33.672 --> 00:25:37.614]  You think they're just setting up internal tariffs with regulations to make our jobs go to China?
[00:25:37.894 --> 00:25:44.177]  They're hitting us on thousands of precision warfare economic fronts.
[00:25:44.897 --> 00:25:46.518]  I get chills when I talk about this.
[00:25:48.699 --> 00:25:52.340]  I mean, holding this country down has been incredibly hard for the globalists, but they've done it.
[00:25:53.161 --> 00:25:57.362]  While using all our money to build a giant military that fights to build the world government.
[00:25:57.683 --> 00:25:58.563]  And then we get the blame.
[00:26:04.551 --> 00:26:08.152]  China gets all of our major deepwater ports east and west coast.
[00:26:08.572 --> 00:26:10.672]  China gets the Panama Canal for free.
[00:26:10.932 --> 00:26:11.452]  We built it.
[00:26:12.553 --> 00:26:12.993]  We run it.
[00:26:13.593 --> 00:26:27.635]  The only passage from the Atlantic into the Pacific, other than going around the Horn, we give them something worth an estimated $5 trillion in a treaty
[00:26:33.982 --> 00:26:38.945]  In 1979 and then it's transferred in 2000 and Congress couldn't even stop it.
[00:26:39.605 --> 00:26:41.066]  Can't we just keep going forever?
[00:26:41.507 --> 00:26:44.188]  Our last lead smelting plant closed.
[00:26:44.929 --> 00:26:48.131]  We can't even produce bullets in America.
[00:26:49.351 --> 00:26:54.715]  Our components are made in China for the fighter planes and the missiles.
[00:26:55.678 --> 00:26:58.039]  It's a total takeover.
[00:26:58.839 --> 00:27:02.060]  It isn't dumb leaders that make bad deals.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.721]  They made deals.
[00:27:04.141 --> 00:27:08.582]  That's why Maurice Strong and all these globalists end up retiring in China.
[00:27:11.223 --> 00:27:14.204]  In Taiwan, in Hong Kong, they're gone.
[00:27:14.464 --> 00:27:20.266]  They made the deals with a country that had a billion slaves, now a billion three hundred million.
[00:27:22.418 --> 00:27:26.071]  They sold us out for globalism on purpose!
[00:27:27.844 --> 00:27:41.873]  And when you see these people on TV and you listen to these pundits and you listen and see every father figure put down in movies and TV and dramas, you know you're looking at the enemy of you and your family and your wife and your children and your husband.
[00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:51.359]  My God, people, come together and admit you're under attack and stop all the stupid infighting on race and all this garbage.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.781]  That is the least of our problems.
[00:27:56.198 --> 00:27:58.178]  Flint, Michigan is rotting.
[00:27:58.399 --> 00:28:02.659]  There's less than 20% of the people that was there back in the 50s and 60s.
[00:28:02.779 --> 00:28:03.500]  It's gone.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.900]  It's collapsing.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.320]  It's a dead city.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.801]  No amount of money can prop it up.
[00:28:09.141 --> 00:28:10.261]  It's condemned.
[00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:13.202]  Of course the water systems are scams.
[00:28:13.502 --> 00:28:14.922]  Of course they're full of poison.
[00:28:15.382 --> 00:28:17.643]  Everywhere they can take pure
[00:28:18.886 --> 00:28:26.269]  Aquifer water out, the most pure on earth in Arkansas, and they dump hundreds of chemicals in it when they're done under state law.
[00:28:27.349 --> 00:28:32.050]  Multinationals came in and lobbied for it, because you pay for the poison.
[00:28:32.791 --> 00:28:35.011]  And now they're going, hey, this is kind of a hoax.
[00:28:35.051 --> 00:28:37.832]  You know, Flint's water is not any more toxic than a lot of other cities.
[00:28:38.193 --> 00:28:40.673]  What I've been saying, but that's not the hoax.
[00:28:40.893 --> 00:28:42.294]  The hoax is it's all poison.
[00:28:46.673 --> 00:29:03.056]  And there are the very Democrats that got the water fluoridated, that call everybody a conspiracy theorist if you say it's dangerous, they're going, oh black people, they want to murder you, it's extermination, it's genocide with the poison water, it's on purpose.
[00:29:03.316 --> 00:29:11.758]  Look, we have the governor's email, where for a couple years he keeps telling Flint, it's your municipal responsibility under state law, fix it!
[00:29:12.698 --> 00:29:16.119]  No, it's the governor, it's the feds, you need to do it!
[00:29:17.409 --> 00:29:20.191]  Oh, it's the feds that shipped your jobs overseas, Michigan.
[00:29:22.332 --> 00:29:27.895]  And it's the unions that harassed and jacked everybody so bad in Michigan that the factories moved to Texas.
[00:29:29.036 --> 00:29:34.299]  But, oh, you're too stupid to get in your cars and get a...
[00:29:36.721 --> 00:29:39.542]  Wagon behind you and drag all your stuff down here.
[00:29:39.702 --> 00:29:44.084]  You know, the Dust Bowl hit the poor people of Oklahoma, black, white, Native American, didn't matter.
[00:29:44.964 --> 00:29:46.644]  Wiped everything out 80, 90 years ago.
[00:29:46.684 --> 00:29:47.185]  What'd they do?
[00:29:47.545 --> 00:29:49.125]  They all moved to California!
[00:29:49.145 --> 00:29:53.827]  I mean, did the Dust Bowl come along because there was some racist?
[00:29:55.548 --> 00:29:58.188]  It's incredible how people have no will to survive.
[00:29:58.749 --> 00:29:59.669]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:01.770]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.391]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.775 --> 00:30:13.400]  Thanks to the Federal Reserve System, America's economy is in a terminal decline.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:18.707]  And according to economic expert Michael Snyder, here's 8 facts that reveal just how bad the economy really is.
[00:30:18.967 --> 00:30:19.208]  Number 1.
[00:30:19.368 --> 00:30:22.632]  The majority of all American workers bring home less than $30,000 a year in wages.
[00:30:22.652 --> 00:30:22.933]  Number 2.
[00:30:24.755 --> 00:30:29.841]  The poorest 40% of all Americans now spend most of their incomes just on food and housing.
[00:30:30.041 --> 00:30:35.228]  At least 50% of Americans who rent their homes spend more than a third of their incomes on the rent.
[00:30:35.508 --> 00:30:38.091]  Incomes keep declining for a large majority of the U.S.
[00:30:38.131 --> 00:30:38.672]  population.
[00:30:39.833 --> 00:30:42.154]  The price of ground beef has more than doubled since 2009.
[00:30:42.355 --> 00:30:45.677]  The rate of homeownership in the U.S.
[00:30:45.717 --> 00:30:47.818]  has been declining for at least seven years in a row.
[00:30:48.058 --> 00:30:51.180]  It's now the lowest that it's been in 20 years.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:58.284]  Almost half of all Americans are not saving their money, and it's been estimated that 62% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:30:58.865 --> 00:31:02.507]  One-third of all Americans with student loans are currently behind on their student loan debt.

[00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:09.331]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:31:09.591 --> 00:31:12.813]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:31:13.114 --> 00:31:21.119]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:31:21.359 --> 00:31:26.383]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:31:26.783 --> 00:31:29.065]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.803]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:31:43.983 --> 00:31:47.946]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[00:31:48.126 --> 00:31:52.909]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:31:53.089 --> 00:31:57.592]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:31:57.752 --> 00:32:01.074]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.

[00:32:12.481 --> 00:32:21.864]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:32:22.224 --> 00:32:24.745]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:32:24.905 --> 00:32:28.266]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:32:28.466 --> 00:32:34.488]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[00:32:34.788 --> 00:32:38.609]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[00:32:38.609 --> 00:32:39.029]  We're good.
[00:33:08.609 --> 00:33:08.733]  Yeah.
[00:33:11.678 --> 00:33:13.739]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:19.523]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:19.943 --> 00:33:25.206]  I wondered so aimless, life filled with sin.
[00:33:25.406 --> 00:33:29.188]  I wouldn't let my dear Savior in.
[00:33:29.929 --> 00:33:34.251]  Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night.
[00:33:34.691 --> 00:33:38.473]  Pray the Lord, I saw the light.
[00:33:38.493 --> 00:33:39.134]  I saw the light!
[00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:42.731]  I saw the light.
[00:33:42.831 --> 00:33:44.951]  I saw the light.
[00:33:45.091 --> 00:33:49.272]  No more darkness, no more night.
[00:33:49.732 --> 00:33:54.034]  Now I'm so happy, no sorrow inside.
[00:33:54.374 --> 00:33:57.554]  Praise the Lord, I saw the light.
[00:33:57.595 --> 00:34:00.015]  That's Hank Williams, bringing us in.
[00:34:01.716 --> 00:34:03.096]  In search of Americana.
[00:34:05.836 --> 00:34:10.960]  I just talked to, via text, Billy Corrigan, of course, of Smashing Pumpkins.
[00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:16.745]  He's working on a very interesting project dealing with Americana that we'll be able to tell you about in the future.
[00:34:17.765 --> 00:34:21.829]  A lot of people fighting tyranny with art, fighting tyranny with ideas.
[00:34:23.114 --> 00:34:24.455]  You want to know how to defeat the globalists?
[00:34:24.575 --> 00:34:28.878]  Produce liberty-based art, liberty-based ideas, things that are beautiful, things that are strong.
[00:34:29.279 --> 00:34:32.001]  Hold up things that the globalists don't want to be seen.
[00:34:33.001 --> 00:34:35.063]  Everything they push, we promote the opposite.
[00:34:35.443 --> 00:34:36.104]  It's pretty simple.
[00:34:36.504 --> 00:34:43.109]  Then you can politically, you can religiously, you can scientifically, you can
[00:34:44.622 --> 00:34:49.405]  Financially, see how opposing them is always a good idea once you go through the technicals.
[00:34:50.065 --> 00:35:00.751]  Man, there is so much news now that I need to get into, but when you read articles like America's Best Days may be behind it, and the New York Times, and more, it really makes me sick.
[00:35:03.193 --> 00:35:05.434]  And America has been taught how to tear itself up.
[00:35:05.494 --> 00:35:08.015]  America has been taught how to have a chip on its shoulder.
[00:35:08.496 --> 00:35:12.438]  And there's a lot of real things out there that do illustrate that
[00:35:13.635 --> 00:35:15.536]  America does have a lot of problems, obviously.
[00:35:15.957 --> 00:35:17.358]  But are they our main problems?
[00:35:17.418 --> 00:35:19.559]  It's like this boycott the Oscars.
[00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:20.920]  Will Smith won't be at the Oscars.
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:21.160]  Good.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.221]  I don't watch the Oscars.
[00:35:23.382 --> 00:35:24.422]  I don't even boycott it.
[00:35:24.462 --> 00:35:29.165]  I just don't worship a bunch of preening peacocks on egomaniac trips.
[00:35:29.566 --> 00:35:30.406]  I like good films.
[00:35:30.446 --> 00:35:31.287]  I like good actors.
[00:35:31.327 --> 00:35:33.468]  But they're not the real world.
[00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:36.390]  They're the tail.
[00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:37.211]  I'm the dog.
[00:35:38.652 --> 00:35:40.173]  They're the tail, you're the dog.
[00:35:40.673 --> 00:35:56.559]  People are like, are you excited that Chris Carter has come out and said that a lot of his new series is based on InfoWars information, and there's a character based on you, and I've now talked via email with Carter and his folks, and he's a listener and all the rest of it, and we're gonna probably get a chance to interview him or talk to him soon.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.240]  I just did that request yesterday.
[00:35:59.861 --> 00:36:04.463]  But the point is, is that what I'm really proud of is that I'm influencing the culture.
[00:36:05.543 --> 00:36:07.664]  You see, we're driving
[00:36:08.749 --> 00:36:09.349]  The bus here.
[00:36:11.891 --> 00:36:13.411]  And that's what you have to realize, folks.
[00:36:13.591 --> 00:36:14.492]  You have the power.
[00:36:16.193 --> 00:36:19.674]  I told this story a few weeks ago, and again, it's not about a power trip.
[00:36:19.694 --> 00:36:21.175]  It's to show the influence you have.
[00:36:21.575 --> 00:36:33.101]  If you go and do an access television show in a good-sized town or city, and you do a decent job and have some energy and give your opinion and views, or even take a video camera out and shoot some reports, you will end up getting viewers.
[00:36:33.621 --> 00:36:36.543]  Then you can use that platform to put it on YouTube, whatever you want.
[00:36:37.731 --> 00:36:43.561]  It's like this lady that went to these government meetings and shows them all bragging about, quote, stealing money and stealing land in Oregon.
[00:36:43.822 --> 00:36:45.144]  It's sensational video.
[00:36:46.066 --> 00:36:50.895]  But somebody just had to go to the open event and just see what they're saying.
[00:36:53.891 --> 00:37:00.473]  It's like we're dodo birds that just sit there when the sailors get off the ships and they run over and whack us on the head with an oar and then eat us.
[00:37:00.793 --> 00:37:02.394]  I mean, you know, the dodo birds didn't run.
[00:37:02.654 --> 00:37:04.234]  They were extinct in just a few years.
[00:37:04.874 --> 00:37:16.698]  I mean, the politicians, their bureaucrats, the globalists are just running around robbing everything, just announcing like they're folks out of the movie Road Warrior, that they're going to sack our society.
[00:37:16.718 --> 00:37:22.340]  And we're just sitting here like dodo birds, taking it.
[00:37:25.563 --> 00:37:38.420]  Again, Mike Judge, Hank Hill, Gribble, and one of the other characters on one of the biggest TV shows in history, based in a composite of me and two other people.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:43.227]  I mean, King of the Hill, X-Files 2, but here's what's important.
[00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:49.551]  It's not me saying, look, these big hit TV shows are partially based on me.
[00:37:49.931 --> 00:37:55.334]  That was in, he was developing that in 95, 96, started airing in 97, folks.
[00:37:56.035 --> 00:38:00.037]  I was on access television and local radio and already influencing people.
[00:38:00.217 --> 00:38:00.918]  That's what I'm getting at.
[00:38:01.098 --> 00:38:09.002]  Just like this lady who I want to get on, by the way, guys who, who went into these retirement events held by the BLM.
[00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:15.773]  In these lavish ballrooms with them bragging about their enterprises.
[00:38:17.553 --> 00:38:19.915]  See, it's not that I'm special, she's special.
[00:38:20.115 --> 00:38:27.018]  It's that it's, I guess, special in a land of zombies, in a land of spectators, in a land of people that don't take action.
[00:38:29.738 --> 00:38:34.559]  When you do something original, when you do something grassroots, it will end up having an effect.
[00:38:34.859 --> 00:38:39.661]  Maybe not the first time you do it, maybe not the 10th time you do it, but it will end up having a big effect.
[00:38:40.221 --> 00:38:46.322]  And a lot of times, the first time somebody goes out to expose corruption, I mean, talk about Providence.
[00:38:47.883 --> 00:38:52.324]  Again, 2000, it was all over the news nationwide, one of our first big, huge stories.
[00:38:53.186 --> 00:38:54.547]  We had a lot before that, but it was big.
[00:38:55.187 --> 00:38:59.869]  And a lady goes, Alex, you better come out of the state rep meeting hall where I was about to testify.
[00:38:59.889 --> 00:39:01.110]  There's bribery going on.
[00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:06.452]  And like a movie, the head of the gun control group was going, 100, 200, 300.
[00:39:09.694 --> 00:39:10.854]  Good testimony.
[00:39:13.455 --> 00:39:14.676]  And we just caught that on tape.
[00:39:15.056 --> 00:39:16.317]  And it defeated a bunch of gun bills.
[00:39:16.337 --> 00:39:16.737]  They admit it.
[00:39:20.905 --> 00:39:23.246]  And then the paper called up and said, why are you racist?
[00:39:23.286 --> 00:39:24.607]  The people he was paying were black.
[00:39:24.887 --> 00:39:26.067]  Would you have said this if they were white?
[00:39:26.087 --> 00:39:26.867]  And I said, of course.
[00:39:27.448 --> 00:39:34.191]  But the real racism was the white gun control guy with the three young black men who didn't act like that behind the scenes.
[00:39:34.211 --> 00:39:38.012]  But once they got up on the stage, they went, yo, yo, yo, I got guns.
[00:39:38.112 --> 00:39:38.532]  I'll hurt you.
[00:39:38.552 --> 00:39:39.213]  I'll take you down.
[00:39:39.253 --> 00:39:40.293]  I'm a dangerous thug.
[00:39:42.554 --> 00:39:43.514]  Playing the part.
[00:39:47.336 --> 00:39:49.557]  Actors from Houston
[00:39:50.848 --> 00:39:52.608]  From an art program, we later learned.
[00:39:53.489 --> 00:39:57.849]  We're paid to get up there and go, yo, yo, we're, you know, stereotypical black thug.
[00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:05.611]  Be like a white guy, to be, you know, stereotypical white thug, you know, and say, I'm racist, or something.
[00:40:05.811 --> 00:40:06.651]  I mean, it was so sick.
[00:40:06.851 --> 00:40:08.692]  Here they were, engaged in the racism.
[00:40:09.512 --> 00:40:13.172]  Look at, look at Michael Moore, perched on top flint.
[00:40:13.533 --> 00:40:14.653]  Michael Moore worth over $100 million.
[00:40:17.847 --> 00:40:20.811]  They're at Flint going racism, racism, genocide against blacks.
[00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:22.974]  60% of the town's blacks was genocide.
[00:40:23.614 --> 00:40:25.397]  But never saying a word about all the poison water.
[00:40:25.597 --> 00:40:27.780]  Never pointing out why all this is really happening.
[00:40:28.421 --> 00:40:30.603]  Saying socialism is the answer to fix Flint.
[00:40:30.944 --> 00:40:31.845]  Flint's gone.
[00:40:32.546 --> 00:40:34.709]  You might be able to stabilize parts of Detroit.
[00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:49.133]  It's sick to watch these people operate, and that's why America's best days are behind it now, until we wake up and realize what's happening.
[00:40:51.474 --> 00:40:57.176]  Now, before we go any further into the news and some clips I want to get to, this is a Wayne Madsen report at Infowars.com.
[00:40:58.516 --> 00:40:58.856]  U.S.
[00:40:58.896 --> 00:41:00.357]  harbors ISIS-linked terrorists.
[00:41:00.817 --> 00:41:01.117]  U.S.
[00:41:01.157 --> 00:41:04.319]  changes status of ISIS-linked group to protected organization.
[00:41:04.819 --> 00:41:05.699]  This is documented.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.721]  It is a big, big deal.
[00:41:14.557 --> 00:41:17.119]  And Wayne Madsen will be joining us to talk about this and more.
[00:41:17.159 --> 00:41:23.886]  There's another article he had yesterday that we published at Infowars.com.
[00:41:24.186 --> 00:41:26.968]  Globalist covering up jihadist violence.
[00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:33.975]  International agreement between some nations to downplay migrant crisis.
[00:41:34.555 --> 00:41:35.877]  And he's got the scoop on that.
[00:41:39.324 --> 00:41:46.811]  But it is an organized planetary agenda that is constantly being tweaked and adjusted, but moving in the same direction.
[00:41:49.354 --> 00:41:53.017]  And going along with it only ensures things are going to get worse.
[00:41:53.237 --> 00:41:57.902]  Now, before I get into the Trump news, because it ties into all this, let's get into the financial news.
[00:41:58.903 --> 00:42:01.265]  Global stocks sink on fresh growth fears.
[00:42:01.285 --> 00:42:04.148]  Remember, three weeks ago Soros gets up
[00:42:06.138 --> 00:42:21.382]  Right as the New Year starts, and on the 1st of January, 21 days ago, three weeks ago exactly, blows the horn, the foghorn, and says, the global collapse has begun!
[00:42:21.402 --> 00:42:23.502]  And he's all pre-positioned.
[00:42:23.802 --> 00:42:29.444]  And then, like dutiful stewards, the mainstream horror media begins to create the panic,
[00:42:30.999 --> 00:42:33.622]  So they can have their organized collapse, which is meant to come.
[00:42:33.662 --> 00:42:35.464]  It's gotta come, but they're timing it.
[00:42:35.524 --> 00:42:39.329]  They're running when it happens, just like the Arab Spring, to consolidate control.
[00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:43.373]  Global stocks sink on fresh growth fears.
[00:42:43.854 --> 00:42:50.342]  Dow Industrial pair losses to drop 249 point, while shares in Japan and UK enter bear markets.
[00:42:52.868 --> 00:42:55.549]  Jobless claims jump to 7-month high.
[00:42:55.789 --> 00:42:56.529]  Market watch.
[00:42:57.229 --> 00:42:58.329]  And that's with Cook Numbers.
[00:42:58.429 --> 00:42:59.449]  As phony as a $3 bill.
[00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:05.211]  StockRoute demotes Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey from billionaire to millionaire.
[00:43:06.111 --> 00:43:08.591]  Oil prices fall below $28 a barrel.
[00:43:08.891 --> 00:43:10.552]  Less than cost of actual barrel.
[00:43:13.312 --> 00:43:14.433]  Guess who builds those barrels?
[00:43:14.513 --> 00:43:14.833]  China.
[00:43:16.313 --> 00:43:17.093]  Rare Earth Minerals.
[00:43:17.433 --> 00:43:20.934]  Because there's a set deal where they get every stinking bit of it by agreement.
[00:43:21.823 --> 00:43:23.965]  You want to have a gold mine you've had for 50 years?
[00:43:24.605 --> 00:43:26.107]  It's operating, making a profit.
[00:43:26.147 --> 00:43:35.395]  We're going to shut you down and one year later a Chinese firm's going to come in and they could dump cyanide right in the river and nothing's going to be said because there's a deal been made.
[00:43:36.315 --> 00:43:37.336]  And you ain't in it!
[00:43:38.137 --> 00:43:38.938]  And I'm not in it!
[00:43:40.503 --> 00:44:08.361]  They haven't gotten all our guns, and they can't get us all to take their vaccines, and they're hopping mad, and people are refusing their GMOs, and people are pulling their kids out of their government-run schools, and people are moving away in exodus from the big cities, and the system's mad, and is out there trying to shut down every small town, and shut down the Amish, and shut down small farms, but local governments and local police aren't going along with it, and are having meetings, and know it's a takeover plan,
[00:44:08.701 --> 00:44:18.806]  And we're getting up on our feet and getting our hands around the globalist's throat, and its face is turning blue, and those little eyes are bugging out of that snot-nosed face!
[00:44:20.367 --> 00:44:24.369]  And everywhere are the real signs of vengeance rising.
[00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:30.111]  But it's a dichotomy, it's a paradox.
[00:44:30.932 --> 00:44:33.073]  It's a best of times, worst of times.
[00:44:36.584 --> 00:44:38.766]  It was a summer of heaven and a winter of hell.
[00:44:43.749 --> 00:44:51.995]  Because many people are totally turning themselves over to the system and believing anything it says, and they're just committing to being morons and giving up.
[00:44:52.961 --> 00:45:04.028]  But still a giant minority of people worldwide of every race, color, creed, and religion are waking up to what's happening, discovering the rabbit hole, and investigating for themselves.
[00:45:04.128 --> 00:45:10.112]  And once you see it, you don't ever turn back, and you don't ever shut your mouth once you know what we're really facing.
[00:45:12.234 --> 00:45:17.057]  Apple falls close to freak-out level as it continues to plunge.
[00:45:18.703 --> 00:45:22.826]  Losing as much as 3.4% in one day yesterday.
[00:45:28.191 --> 00:45:31.293]  Crashing oil prices hit former Texas boom towns.
[00:45:33.355 --> 00:45:33.535]  Yep.
[00:45:34.616 --> 00:45:35.216]  Big time.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.142]  That's just some of the news we're going to be covering on that front.
[00:45:42.202 --> 00:45:45.605]  Before I go any further, though, I want to get into Donald Trump.
[00:45:45.665 --> 00:45:46.486]  As I said earlier,
[00:45:48.513 --> 00:45:49.594]  Donald Trump is wrong.
[00:45:49.754 --> 00:45:50.635]  I like Donald Trump.
[00:45:51.575 --> 00:45:54.177]  The whole Davos elite are absolutely out to get him.
[00:45:55.078 --> 00:45:55.898]  That's in the news.
[00:45:56.419 --> 00:46:02.523]  Trump fear stalks Davos as elite prey for spring reality check.
[00:46:03.164 --> 00:46:08.228]  Oh, the reality check of the same old bought-and-paid-for candidates on both sides.
[00:46:08.288 --> 00:46:10.109]  It'll bring us the exact same agenda.
[00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:16.434]  And the people are desperately waking up, going for anybody they think is Americana like Trump or Cruz.
[00:46:19.761 --> 00:46:21.682]  Concerns over protectionism and U.S.
[00:46:21.722 --> 00:46:23.082]  reputation bubble up.
[00:46:23.182 --> 00:46:26.943]  Ex-White House advisor still thinks Obama will be nominee.
[00:46:27.663 --> 00:46:28.663]  Protectionism?
[00:46:30.644 --> 00:46:34.425]  You mean where China can have massive tariffs and stuff on us but we can't on them?
[00:46:34.445 --> 00:46:38.186]  And where the World Trade Organization keeps ruling on behalf of them?
[00:46:38.206 --> 00:46:42.367]  And where they keep their currency super low, another tariff?
[00:46:43.968 --> 00:46:48.369]  And all the slave labor and the no environmental regulations, but we have all of them so we can't compete?
[00:46:52.315 --> 00:46:54.176]  They're shutting down our power plants, but not theirs.
[00:46:54.196 --> 00:46:54.876]  They're building more?
[00:46:55.837 --> 00:46:57.278]  Oh, you're worried about protectionism?
[00:46:57.478 --> 00:46:59.319]  What about being screwed over by the globalists?
[00:46:59.899 --> 00:47:02.741]  All he said is he's not going to let these one-sided deals continue.
[00:47:03.862 --> 00:47:05.763]  And he's going to put economic pressure on China.
[00:47:05.903 --> 00:47:10.405]  By the way, we're already imploding anyways under the Walmart-Chinese-Communist model.
[00:47:10.425 --> 00:47:19.691]  And there's an article up on Infowars.com that breaks all this down.
[00:47:21.977 --> 00:47:29.221]  Trump has now come out and responded to Glenn Beck, who's constantly attacking him, saying he's a Hillary plant.
[00:47:29.901 --> 00:47:30.822]  I see no evidence of that.
[00:47:30.842 --> 00:47:34.664]  He's been viciously going after Hillary on the rapes and all the rest of it.
[00:47:37.025 --> 00:47:40.707]  And the Clintons are in big trouble because of it, something the other Republicans won't do.
[00:47:41.347 --> 00:47:47.971]  And so the bottom line is, we don't need Glenn Beck and Donald Trump fighting.
[00:47:49.167 --> 00:47:53.649]  But that's what Beck's going to do to insert himself into this.
[00:47:53.709 --> 00:47:56.270]  And he's now going around with Cruz, which I think is a big mistake.
[00:47:58.051 --> 00:48:01.292]  I don't care if he campaigns with him, but making it all an attack on Donald Trump.
[00:48:02.213 --> 00:48:03.613]  And it's going to blow up in both their faces.
[00:48:03.954 --> 00:48:12.337]  And you notice that suddenly, not because of the Palin endorsement, in my view, but because of the attacks that Cruz is involved in on Trump.
[00:48:13.638 --> 00:48:16.579]  Cruz is starting to go down in polls in New Hampshire and other areas.
[00:48:16.959 --> 00:48:18.360]  The exact same thing that
[00:48:20.333 --> 00:48:27.117]  Rand Paul did, six months ago, and I told him, on air, off air, I said, do not attack Trump.
[00:48:28.278 --> 00:48:32.221]  If you want to beat him, pick up the rhetoric, the Americana rhetoric.
[00:48:33.682 --> 00:48:34.382]  Didn't listen to me.
[00:48:35.163 --> 00:48:37.164]  And I like Rand Paul, he was on last week.
[00:48:41.448 --> 00:48:42.709]  But Trump's now history.
[00:48:42.749 --> 00:48:44.329]  He's got the whole establishment against him.
[00:48:44.749 --> 00:48:47.451]  Even if he hasn't been perfect in the past, he wants to be president.
[00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:51.332]  He wants to be the guy that's the turnaround executive that helps save America.
[00:48:51.552 --> 00:48:52.813]  And that's not in the globalist plan.
[00:48:53.313 --> 00:48:58.636]  So look for him to blow up his airplane or shoot him or, you know, put dead bodies in his backyard or say he's a child molester.
[00:48:58.676 --> 00:48:59.696]  I mean, get ready, folks.
[00:49:00.016 --> 00:49:01.317]  They're going to pull out the stops.
[00:49:01.417 --> 00:49:02.617]  Say he's a mafia don.
[00:49:02.937 --> 00:49:03.438]  Who knows?
[00:49:04.018 --> 00:49:08.420]  But Trump mocks Cruz's plan to campaign with wacko Glenn Beck.
[00:49:09.721 --> 00:49:13.905]  Donald Trump calls Glenn Beck's endorsement of Ted Cruz a sad answer to Sarah Palin's endorsement.
[00:49:15.266 --> 00:49:23.915]  Donald Trump mocked Glenn Beck's planned appearances with Ted Cruz in Iowa in the coming days, portraying it as a sad answer to Sarah Palin's endorsement of his own candidacy earlier this week.
[00:49:24.856 --> 00:49:28.079]  Yeah, what that is, is basically Clear Channel endorsing Cruz.
[00:49:30.455 --> 00:49:36.403]  Whatever, I'll take either one of them, but we don't need these two damaging each other ahead of this to help Hillary.
[00:49:36.703 --> 00:49:39.847]  And I know their answer is, hey Alex, we gotta beat each other.
[00:49:40.408 --> 00:49:42.511]  Okay, well, Cruz, you're not gonna beat Trump doing that.
[00:49:42.971 --> 00:49:44.914]  I'd be just as happy with you in there, quite frankly.
[00:49:46.296 --> 00:49:48.639]  But, you've been giving bad advice, buddy.
[00:49:49.758 --> 00:49:58.543]  You really have been, and there's this whole line that Trump's establishment, because he says the establishment's been calling him lately, saying, you know, let off, we'll work with you.
[00:49:58.743 --> 00:50:00.244]  That's Trump saying he's having victory.
[00:50:00.484 --> 00:50:07.148]  When the establishment comes groveling on their knees, on their, all fours, it smells like victory.
[00:50:07.969 --> 00:50:15.133]  That doesn't, see, I've always said I want to take over the establishment and return the republic, not just hide out in the woods with a gun, imagining I'm a secret agent.
[00:50:16.093 --> 00:50:17.394]  I want to take the republic back.
[00:50:17.514 --> 00:50:18.355]  I want to win.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.483]  And then dismantle the government 90%.
[00:50:22.464 --> 00:50:24.526]  That's what a statesman does, what a leader does.
[00:50:26.989 --> 00:50:28.571]  You have to be ready to win, folks.
[00:50:28.611 --> 00:50:31.355]  You have to be ready to win, or you'll never win.
[00:50:32.858 --> 00:50:34.840]  But the churches have taught us it's the end of the world.
[00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.361]  Foregone conclusion.
[00:50:37.002 --> 00:50:37.902]  There's nothing we can do.
[00:50:37.963 --> 00:50:38.823]  It's the end of the world.
[00:50:39.164 --> 00:50:40.945]  So just don't believe anything can ever be fixed.
[00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:43.928]  Don't worry about your kids on drugs or whatever they're doing.
[00:50:43.948 --> 00:50:46.070]  Just sit back and just turn everything loose.
[00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:49.293]  Let the government run things and Jesus will fix it all.
[00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:53.002]  Well, that's not what my Bible tells me, and we're in trouble!
[00:50:53.242 --> 00:50:56.906]  Look at the fruits of what we've done in this country, turning things over and laying down.
[00:50:57.427 --> 00:50:59.128]  That article's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:59.148 --> 00:51:05.155]  The big news, straight ahead, Russia's Putin, this is Reuters, approved London murder.
[00:51:05.175 --> 00:51:06.296]  Yeah, right, stay with us.
[00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:13.149]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?

[00:53:12.983 --> 00:53:13.504]  It's true.
[00:53:13.604 --> 00:53:17.566]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.

[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.401]  Big Berkey Water Filters, for the love of clean water!
[00:54:14.046 --> 00:54:17.331]  You ain't got nothing if you ain't free.
[00:54:30.107 --> 00:54:33.969]  There's a video report that David Knight filed yesterday that I really need to play sometime today.
[00:54:34.029 --> 00:54:36.310]  It's smart guns, dumb and dumber.
[00:54:36.351 --> 00:54:45.196]  But I want to retweet that article and video out at Real Alex Jones because folks need to see this and understand what's behind smart cars, smart guns, smart meters.
[00:54:45.556 --> 00:54:50.099]  That means tax ya, trace ya, scam ya, screw ya over.
[00:54:51.159 --> 00:54:56.883]  And Obama wants six billion dollars of tax money given to the auto industry to have the new revolution of smart cars.
[00:54:58.968 --> 00:55:00.469]  Which they admit are going to tax you by the mile.
[00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:08.375]  And if the public's dumb enough to buy into it, they'll just have some sports icon go, I love my self-driving car, and every face painter will run out and get one.
[00:55:09.696 --> 00:55:12.718]  Or maybe you could wake up and stop being so gullible and reject it.
[00:55:13.759 --> 00:55:15.360]  Just like we're rejecting McDonald's.
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:18.202]  The fall of McDonald's is a microcosm.
[00:55:19.743 --> 00:55:21.504]  Of how no matter what they do, they're imploding.
[00:55:21.604 --> 00:55:22.445]  People are done with them.
[00:55:23.553 --> 00:55:26.616]  Same thing with other big establishment outfits, like Walmart and others.
[00:55:27.017 --> 00:55:28.518]  People are really getting it now.
[00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:31.441]  And as a culture, you just say no, it's over.
[00:55:31.942 --> 00:55:34.204]  Unless they get a full prison grid in over you.
[00:55:34.504 --> 00:55:40.270]  I want to give you this Reuters article on Russia, which signals a big shift towards conflict, towards war.
[00:55:41.131 --> 00:55:41.992]  Before we do that though,
[00:55:43.885 --> 00:55:46.767]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't steer you wrong.
[00:55:47.067 --> 00:55:54.172]  I really bust my hind end, and I bust my gray matter, trying to really bring you the best products.

[00:55:56.433 --> 00:55:58.014]  Look at what's happening in Flint and other areas.
[00:55:58.374 --> 00:56:04.659]  If you're not getting water filtration systems, and not filtering your water, and not getting the proper systems that really cut out the garbage, you're insane in my view.

[00:56:21.251 --> 00:56:29.438]  And then finally, Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2 is the purest, most powerful iodine we believe anybody else has.
[00:56:30.759 --> 00:56:33.121]  There may be somebody out there that's got some iodine that's more pure.
[00:56:34.266 --> 00:56:35.026]  We haven't found it.
[00:56:35.446 --> 00:56:37.707]  And what it does is amazing.
[00:56:37.827 --> 00:56:38.588]  Read the reviews.

[00:56:39.988 --> 00:56:40.989]  It's the good halogen.

[00:57:28.815 --> 00:57:34.962]  So you are the InfoWar and I salute you and also thank our affiliates and other sponsors and the network GCNLive.com.
[00:57:35.483 --> 00:57:41.250]  All right, I'm going to get more into this in the next five minutes segment and then we start having guest on Leanne McAdoo from Flint.
[00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:48.196]  Larry Nichols has huge breaking news on the fact that he believes they are getting ready to probably run Biden with Elizabeth Warren.
[00:57:48.236 --> 00:57:48.996]  That's going to be breaking.
[00:57:49.777 --> 00:57:55.602]  Wayne Madsen, formerly the NSA, huge evidence of exactly what's happening with the radical jihad insertions.
[00:57:56.243 --> 00:58:00.266]  But on the Putin situation, let me boil it down and then I'll go into detail.
[00:58:01.247 --> 00:58:09.114]  When they start coming out in Reuters and AP and it's all over the headlines, Russia's Putin probably approved London murder of ex-KGB agent.
[00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:18.445]  Lidovinko, UK inquiry says, this is a UK government that got caught lying about WMDs in Iraq, killing their head inspector, Dr. David Kelly.
[00:58:18.485 --> 00:58:20.267]  I mean, they're covering up the pedophilia.
[00:58:20.607 --> 00:58:25.030]  I believe something out of the UK government, like I believe something coming out of the mouth of Satan himself.
[00:58:26.931 --> 00:58:30.153]  But whatever, the Russians, you know, pretty much, I'm not defending with the Russians.
[00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.654]  They have a right to kill their secret agents when they become traitors.
[00:58:32.734 --> 00:58:33.875]  I mean, they're supposed to.
[00:58:36.092 --> 00:58:37.113]  Who knows if they killed him?
[00:58:37.133 --> 00:58:38.374]  The evidence isn't overwhelming.
[00:58:38.675 --> 00:58:41.117]  The point is, this signals something big, but I do know this.
[00:58:41.497 --> 00:58:47.023]  A bunch of Russian officials have been dropping dead, including the head of all Russian security two weeks ago.
[00:58:47.463 --> 00:58:51.086]  There's an internal, behind-the-scenes, black-off war going on, folks.
[00:58:51.347 --> 00:58:54.049]  Stuff is getting hot, and that means dangerous.
[00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:56.532]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.676 --> 00:59:02.897]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:59:03.197 --> 00:59:11.200]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:16.461]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:59:30.469 --> 00:59:32.069]  We're introducing the best yet.
[00:59:32.209 --> 00:59:36.132]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[00:59:36.272 --> 00:59:40.874]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[00:59:41.094 --> 00:59:48.018]  This new 4-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[00:59:48.178 --> 00:59:55.122]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping at InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139 to order your ProMax Shower Filter from ProPure today.
[01:00:02.268 --> 01:00:18.055]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:19.076 --> 01:00:25.339]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.219 --> 01:00:46.584]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got some really serious situations going on obviously with the designed implosion of the world economy.
[01:00:47.904 --> 01:00:53.146]  We've got the establishment Western Media after many years.
[01:00:54.606 --> 01:01:07.256]  Of beating around the bush, claiming they think that the Russian government killed this former spy, saying now that the British inquiry, the UK inquiry, is saying, no, we believe Putin, without having the evidence, was behind it.
[01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:12.600]  And that's done so they can have more sanctions on Russia and really ratchet things up.
[01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:17.084]  Meanwhile, our leaders call for killing Snowden constantly.
[01:01:18.765 --> 01:01:23.509]  Well, he exposed criminal, illegal spying on the American people that they've been lying about.
[01:01:25.814 --> 01:01:27.776]  This guy had done something entirely different.
[01:01:28.557 --> 01:01:34.262]  Russia's Putin probably approved London murder of KGB agent Litvinenko.
[01:01:35.323 --> 01:01:48.355]  UK inquiry finds President Vladimir Putin probably approved the 2006, that's 10 years ago, Russian intelligence operation to murder former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, if I pronounced that right, with radioactive
[01:01:49.329 --> 01:01:57.294]  Polonium-210 in London, a British inquiry concluded on Thursday, prompting a row or fight with Moscow.
[01:01:57.735 --> 01:02:03.879]  Russia, which had declined to cooperate in the inquiry, cautioned pointedly that it could, quote, poison relations, pun intended,
[01:02:04.779 --> 01:02:07.800]  Britain accused the Kremlin of uncivilized behavior.
[01:02:08.781 --> 01:02:16.123]  The UK funding ISIS to kill hundreds of thousands of Christians and set up Libya and overthrow it with the French and others and uncivilized.
[01:02:16.544 --> 01:02:24.227]  Or running the IRA for decades and bombing things and the IRA not even knowing it was being run by them as a pretext to keep troops in Ireland.
[01:02:25.207 --> 01:02:25.827]  Uncivilized.
[01:02:26.467 --> 01:02:27.788]  I'm not against the British folks.
[01:02:27.948 --> 01:02:32.650]  I mean, you know, anytime you bash a corrupt government, people say, why are you bashing my country?
[01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:39.750]  It's not a country, it's a globalist command base feeding on the British to the Irish.
[01:02:40.091 --> 01:02:46.077]  It doesn't matter from the pick Scots to all these Gaelic and Norse tribes.
[01:02:47.335 --> 01:02:52.137]  And the fact that the old kings could get all the tribes killing each other just shows how divide and conquer works.
[01:02:52.717 --> 01:02:57.500]  People are all basically genetically one half of one percent maybe different.
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:01.602]  You're all related and you're murdering each other like morons as usual.
[01:03:02.142 --> 01:03:03.462]  And that's just how they control everybody.
[01:03:03.502 --> 01:03:05.483]  In Africa they'll get one tribe to kill the other too.
[01:03:06.204 --> 01:03:07.184]  Using anthropology.
[01:03:07.744 --> 01:03:08.645]  Using sociology.
[01:03:09.945 --> 01:03:12.046]  That's what the CIA and others do and people love it.
[01:03:12.126 --> 01:03:13.267]  People love to be played.
[01:03:15.728 --> 01:03:28.875]  Lidovinko, 43, an outspoken critic of Putin who had fled Russia for Britain six years to the day before he was poisoned, died after drinking green tea laced with a rare and very potent radioactive isotope at London's Millennium Hotel.
[01:03:29.836 --> 01:03:37.420]  An inquiry led by senior British judge Robert Owen found that former KGB bodyguard... Andrew?
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.100]  How do you say that?
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.281]  A-N-D-R-E-I?
[01:03:42.046 --> 01:03:43.747]  Andrei, how do you say that?
[01:03:44.027 --> 01:03:45.548]  Lugovoy, that's what I thought.
[01:03:46.028 --> 01:03:48.649]  And we don't even have a person who speaks Russian here to help me, folks.
[01:03:48.909 --> 01:03:59.113]  And another Russian carried out the killing as part of an operation probably directed by Russia's Federal Security Services, the main heir to the Soviet ex-KGB.
[01:03:59.734 --> 01:04:02.395]  Notice that they go up there and say, Putin kills all the press.
[01:04:03.291 --> 01:04:04.252]  And they never show any proof.
[01:04:04.552 --> 01:04:07.974]  And then they have Donald Trump saying, okay, well show me the proof and then fine.
[01:04:08.374 --> 01:04:08.995]  But they can't do it.
[01:04:09.015 --> 01:04:10.436]  And they don't have any proof here.
[01:04:10.496 --> 01:04:20.762]  The FSB operation to kill Mr. Levinko was probably approved by them, then the head of the FSB, and also Mr. Putin, Owen said.
[01:04:22.243 --> 01:04:26.186]  I have concluded that there is strong possibility that they poisoned Mr.
[01:04:27.967 --> 01:04:28.628]  Levinenko.
[01:04:29.168 --> 01:04:31.190]  He did so under the direction of the FSB.
[01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:35.293]  I have further concluded, and then they go on to basically blame him with no proof.
[01:04:35.653 --> 01:04:37.414]  But, I mean, there's a good chance they did.
[01:04:37.515 --> 01:04:38.675]  Maybe 40, 50 percent.
[01:04:38.776 --> 01:04:39.276]  I don't know.
[01:04:39.856 --> 01:04:45.281]  There's a good chance this guy had outlived his usefulness and knew where the bodies were buried and knew who some of the other defectors were.
[01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:47.602]  So MI6 killed him or CIA.
[01:04:47.663 --> 01:04:48.403]  I mean, who knows?
[01:04:48.783 --> 01:04:52.586]  Or a Russian oligarch that's a double agent playing both sides.
[01:04:52.646 --> 01:04:56.509]  I mean, maybe 50 percent chance the Russians did it to send a message.
[01:04:57.430 --> 01:05:05.422]  But they generally don't even do that because they've had a sophisticated stance of not engaging to not escalate things.
[01:05:05.482 --> 01:05:07.164]  The West is escalating.
[01:05:10.885 --> 01:05:23.897]  The Intelligence Community's Inspector General has just revealed to lawmakers that Hillary Clinton had classified documents above Top Secret on her private email server, in addition to over 1,300 other classified emails.
[01:05:24.297 --> 01:05:33.306]  Access to information in the Special Access Program is more highly restricted, more sensitive than Top Secret, because it would likely reveal the source, putting lives at risk.
[01:05:33.826 --> 01:05:40.871]  We're constantly told that our money, our rule of law, our liberties must all be sacrificed on the altar of national security.
[01:05:41.072 --> 01:05:46.115]  Hillary has violated the surveillance state's religion, and she needs to be burned at the stake.
[01:05:46.556 --> 01:05:48.417]  Orange is the new pantsuit, Hillary.
[01:05:48.637 --> 01:05:55.562]  But she's being investigated by Obama's Justice Department, and she has about as much chance of going to jail as a Chicago cop.
[01:05:55.783 --> 01:06:01.347]  If she gets away with these crimes, the fraud of the surveillance state will be inescapably obvious to all.
[01:06:04.845 --> 01:06:08.149]  For more information, go to Infowars.com.
[01:06:08.409 --> 01:06:08.989]  I'm David Knight.
[01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:13.734]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:18.679]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:06:18.799 --> 01:06:19.800]  Talk about the effects.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.622]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:06:21.642 --> 01:06:23.284]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:06:23.565 --> 01:06:24.626]  I feel like I look better.
[01:06:24.686 --> 01:06:25.327]  I feel better.
[01:06:25.387 --> 01:06:26.428]  I feel sexier.
[01:06:26.448 --> 01:06:27.169]  I love it.
[01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:30.333]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[01:07:27.285 --> 01:07:39.075]  It is concentrated herbs and natural organic compounds known to energize the body's natural processes that are blocked by estrogen mimickers and other toxic elements in the food chain.
[01:07:39.236 --> 01:07:44.280]  Super Mill Vitality from InfoWarsLife.com has sold out multiple times in the last three months.
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:51.787]  To fix that problem, we have now produced the biggest and most concentrated high-quality batch of Super Mel Vitality in the product's history.
[01:07:52.007 --> 01:07:54.590]  Our new ultra-strength formula is even stronger.
[01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:59.094]  Check out the third-party reviews and informational videos at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:59.314 --> 01:08:02.037]  Now it's time to get your body in balance and fight back.
[01:08:02.277 --> 01:08:08.303]  I'm Alex Jones for Super Mel Vitality and InfoWarsLife.com, and I salute you, our supporters!
[01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:18.193]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:18.813 --> 01:08:21.795]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:31.864 --> 01:08:36.565]  It is 10 degrees Fahrenheit and dropping in the snow in Flint, Michigan.
[01:08:37.445 --> 01:08:43.687]  So Leanne McAdoo's iPhone-based systems that are sending us a live Skype feed are cutting out.
[01:08:44.207 --> 01:08:47.567]  I may have to get her indoors out there with our intrepid camera folks.
[01:08:47.987 --> 01:08:49.008]  Coming up, U.S.
[01:08:49.068 --> 01:08:54.809]  sending 26 fighter jets to base in Tokyo over expanded crises with China.
[01:08:55.989 --> 01:09:02.993]  We now have the British government openly accusing Putin of poisoning a former KGB agent ten years ago.
[01:09:03.033 --> 01:09:06.015]  This is all part of the escalating situation.
[01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:09.057]  Global stocks sink on fresh growth fears.
[01:09:10.038 --> 01:09:12.099]  Jobless numbers at seven-month lows.
[01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:15.401]  Apple falls close to a freak-out level.
[01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:19.083]  And oil drops down to $27 a barrel.
[01:09:19.403 --> 01:09:22.785]  Radical Islamists are... I have like five articles again today.
[01:09:22.845 --> 01:09:23.986]  Every day it seems to be five articles.
[01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:28.191]  Running around raping, murdering, killing, not getting in trouble.
[01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:29.472]  Wayne Madsen's coming on.
[01:09:29.813 --> 01:09:31.675]  The story's on Infowars.com.
[01:09:32.076 --> 01:09:32.877]  Report U.S.
[01:09:32.917 --> 01:09:36.641]  is harboring ISIS-linked terrorists right now inside the U.S.
[01:09:37.182 --> 01:09:37.722]  knowingly.
[01:09:38.885 --> 01:09:41.267]  This is just amazing to have it confirmed.
[01:09:41.947 --> 01:09:44.269]  Also, Globalist covering up jihadist violence.
[01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:46.090]  Wayne Madsen joins us.
[01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:50.032]  Also, former Clinton insider says he's got inside intel.
[01:09:50.052 --> 01:09:55.276]  And of course, he's one of the main guys that helped expose the whole Monica Lewinsky thing going way back.
[01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:58.198]  And that is Larry Nichols coming on about inside campaign 2016.
[01:09:59.018 --> 01:10:00.960]  Are they really getting ready to dump Hillary?
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.021]  And who will run with Biden?
[01:10:03.201 --> 01:10:04.002]  That is coming up.
[01:10:05.257 --> 01:10:12.960]  At the bottom of the hour, a travel advisory has been put out for many areas of Mexico saying it's completely lawless by the State Department.
[01:10:13.301 --> 01:10:14.601]  Tell us something we don't know.
[01:10:14.741 --> 01:10:23.505]  Our own government helped destabilize Mexico and now El Chapo was caught with a U.S.-made .50 cal shipped to him by the Justice Department, John P. Holdren.
[01:10:24.065 --> 01:10:25.846]  John P. Holdren is the White House Science Czar.
[01:10:26.146 --> 01:10:28.868]  Eric Holder, I confuse the two, the former Attorney General.
[01:10:29.249 --> 01:10:32.611]  Incredible, and there's not even a call in Congress for an investigation.
[01:10:32.631 --> 01:10:36.053]  Just, it's just, oh, Hillary's been caught lying on emails again.
[01:10:36.073 --> 01:10:40.736]  And then she just says, oh no, you know, none of these were really classified.
[01:10:40.756 --> 01:10:44.239]  I mean, they were all classified, but they weren't certified classified, so it's okay.
[01:10:44.759 --> 01:10:45.579]  Point is, she lied.
[01:10:45.599 --> 01:10:47.301]  There were more emails than they were classified.
[01:10:48.541 --> 01:10:49.622]  So, it's all coming up.
[01:10:49.682 --> 01:10:53.325]  But first, Leanne McAdoo is going to be filing reports for the Nightly News.
[01:10:54.524 --> 01:11:11.370]  Leanne McAdoo is also going to be talking to folks there on the ground where we've got Michael Moore and Jesse Jackson and the usual suspects running around saying the Republican governor has poisoned the black people in an operation of genocide.
[01:11:15.999 --> 01:11:17.739]  And we've lost our Skype connection to her.
[01:11:17.759 --> 01:11:21.980]  We're going to get that back in a moment, but let me give you some of the background on this.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.141]  Michigan governor under fire over emails.
[01:11:25.501 --> 01:11:38.364]  I'm not defending him because he's a Republican, but the emails that he's released say it's Flint's job to run your wastewater and to control this.
[01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:39.704]  It's not the state's job.
[01:11:41.805 --> 01:11:43.045]  This has been going on for years.
[01:11:44.062 --> 01:11:49.106]  And then now there's more mainstream reports admitting that the water there is toxic, like many other areas of the country.
[01:11:49.187 --> 01:11:50.868]  We're given toxic water.
[01:11:51.429 --> 01:11:53.871]  These water treatment plants usually make it more toxic.
[01:11:54.351 --> 01:11:59.175]  Most areas take it out of aquifers, like Texas and Arkansas, Oklahoma and other areas.
[01:11:59.656 --> 01:12:01.157]  Huge aquifers in the middle of the U.S.
[01:12:01.577 --> 01:12:02.378]  Pure, clean water.
[01:12:02.458 --> 01:12:04.340]  And then they put a bunch of chlorine and fluoride in it.
[01:12:05.861 --> 01:12:07.222]  And upwards of 300 other chemicals.
[01:12:07.242 --> 01:12:07.683]  Usually it's about 200.
[01:12:11.078 --> 01:12:15.544]  So it's all just absolutely out of control, and I want to go over all of this.
[01:12:16.325 --> 01:12:23.615]  There's a bunch of clips of Obama now chiming in on this, and I want to go to one of them, where he pledges support to Flint.
[01:12:24.597 --> 01:12:27.841]  You ship the jobs to China and to Mexico.
[01:12:28.871 --> 01:12:30.913]  The unions ran what was left out of the state.
[01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:33.274]  You Democrats ran these cities.
[01:12:33.915 --> 01:12:38.218]  And then you sit around blaming people for it and pledging support.
[01:12:38.318 --> 01:12:39.179]  It's a dead city.
[01:12:39.439 --> 01:12:40.640]  It's a collapsing city.
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:41.801]  You can't fix it.
[01:12:42.862 --> 01:12:47.746]  There were times when Rome would be abandoned for 400, 500 years because there was no more infrastructure.
[01:12:48.006 --> 01:12:49.067]  And then it came back slowly.
[01:12:49.707 --> 01:12:51.148]  That's what happens historically.
[01:12:52.509 --> 01:12:53.430]  With human migration.
[01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:54.070]  It's dead.
[01:12:54.271 --> 01:12:55.091]  You can't prop it up.
[01:12:55.311 --> 01:12:58.594]  And it's not the people of America's job to prop it all up forever.
[01:12:59.844 --> 01:13:11.693]  It's the people's job in Flint to filter their water, get their own local government in charge, kick the foreign controllers out that control their water districts, or move to another state.
[01:13:13.434 --> 01:13:14.515]  But let's go ahead and go to Obama.
[01:13:14.555 --> 01:13:15.976]  Here it is.
[01:13:15.996 --> 01:13:20.679]  To talk for a second about what's happening in Flint, you know,
[01:13:28.078 --> 01:13:29.780]  I am very proud of what I've done as president.
[01:13:30.741 --> 01:13:38.808]  But the only job that's more important to me is the job of father.
[01:13:42.332 --> 01:13:47.457]  And I know that if I was a parent up there, I would be beside myself.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:52.300]  That my kid's health could be at risk.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.881]  I wonder if he's going to fake cry again.
[01:13:54.621 --> 01:13:57.982]  That's why over the weekend I declared a federal emergency in Flint.
[01:13:59.042 --> 01:14:02.803]  To send more resources on top of the assistance that we've already put on the ground.
[01:14:02.823 --> 01:14:04.203]  Just like the Feds did in Katrina?
[01:14:04.563 --> 01:14:08.404]  We've designated a federal coordinator to make sure the people of Flint get what they need.
[01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:11.344]  Just like they didn't get the stuff from the people of 9-11?
[01:14:11.424 --> 01:14:16.105]  Yesterday I met with Mayor Weaver in the White House in the Oval Office.
[01:14:16.745 --> 01:14:19.126]  And I told her that we are going to have her back and
[01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:27.193]  All the people of Flint's back as they work their way through this terrible tragedy.
[01:14:28.833 --> 01:14:40.676]  So he sells us out with the Republicans, Obamacare meant to screw us over, black unemployment doubles under Obama, worst it's ever been, and he uses all this, you know, urban nomenclature.
[01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:41.897]  I got your back!
[01:14:41.997 --> 01:14:42.677]  I'm your friend!
[01:14:43.749 --> 01:14:46.992]  When he's not giving speeches about, you can't have air conditioning or a car.
[01:14:47.452 --> 01:14:49.113]  It's not good for the environment, Africa.
[01:14:49.453 --> 01:14:53.477]  He doesn't want you to have any infrastructure, whether you're white or black.
[01:14:54.277 --> 01:14:55.158]  He's an elitist.
[01:15:00.222 --> 01:15:16.611]  I tell you, all of these governors, all of these mayors, all of them need to be investigated for the criminality of adding hydrofluorosilicic acid to the water that Harvard admits brain damages you and gives you cancer, and even the EPA says get it out of the water for 20 years, but they won't, because then they've got to admit everything else they've done is a lie.
[01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:20.133]  They dump toxic waste in the water, calling it fluoride.
[01:15:23.995 --> 01:15:28.297]  They sit there running all these scams and put it in these big, fancy water treatment facilities.
[01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:34.753]  Give themselves waivers, give us all this garbage, and then grandstand and say it's racism.
[01:15:37.375 --> 01:15:38.276]  Forget racism.
[01:15:38.776 --> 01:15:41.118]  It's a distraction from what they're doing to everybody.
[01:15:41.518 --> 01:15:44.380]  What's going on in Flint is a crime against humanity.
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.742]  What about the 40% that aren't black in Flint?
[01:15:47.302 --> 01:15:47.862]  Michael Moore?
[01:15:48.743 --> 01:15:51.065]  It's just crazy how they try to get us to think like that.
[01:15:52.202 --> 01:15:53.222]  How racist they are!
[01:15:53.442 --> 01:16:02.786]  How he's a big fat race pimp, trying to play people off against each other with scientific systems of sociology developed by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:16:03.006 --> 01:16:04.187]  They're running a playbook.
[01:16:05.927 --> 01:16:06.648]  Hey, how about this?
[01:16:07.128 --> 01:16:15.451]  Fluoride, on average, has double the bad health effects in major studies, on average, on blacks.
[01:16:17.605 --> 01:16:23.526]  Just like fluoride is worse for males long-term than it is females, except in the area of the thyroid it's worse for females.
[01:16:23.586 --> 01:16:24.026]  It varies.
[01:16:24.926 --> 01:16:25.667]  Just type in studies.
[01:16:25.927 --> 01:16:27.247]  Fluoride hurts blacks worse.
[01:16:27.747 --> 01:16:31.828]  Oh, you're not hearing a word about that from Michael Moore, because that'd be real.
[01:16:32.848 --> 01:16:33.908]  That'd be something true.
[01:16:36.469 --> 01:16:43.230]  Michael Moore's warning to President Obama, don't fly into Detroit and fly out of Detroit and have that George Bush moment of looking out the window at Flint.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:51.503]  Yeah, because you've screwed over black people so bad, part of your job, go there and pat him on the head and make him think you're going to help him.
[01:16:51.523 --> 01:16:53.544]  Like that woman going, can I please have a house?
[01:16:53.564 --> 01:16:54.584]  You know, I live out of my car.
[01:16:54.604 --> 01:16:56.045]  And he goes, we're going to get you that house.
[01:16:56.265 --> 01:16:58.006]  And then it was Republicans got her the house.
[01:16:59.106 --> 01:17:08.630]  My gosh, if he was actually going to tell her he's going to get her a house as a PR stunt, like Oprah handing out free cars, he should have at least gotten the lady a house, but he knows he's got her vote.
[01:17:10.711 --> 01:17:14.333]  And so it's all about not giving her what he says he'll give her in her face.
[01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:30.663]  Michigan governor under fire over emails about water crisis, and you read them, and he's telling them a year ago, you guys are the city, you got the tax base, it's not the state government's job to run the water districts, you've got the taxing authority.
[01:17:30.863 --> 01:17:31.884]  That's the Constitution!
[01:17:34.585 --> 01:17:37.746]  Michigan authorities debated responsibility for Flint water crisis.
[01:17:37.766 --> 01:17:38.206]  Well, watch.
[01:17:38.586 --> 01:17:41.248]  Let's see if the feds, after the cameras are off, actually do anything in Flint.
[01:17:41.788 --> 01:17:44.769]  Why some Michigan politicians say the Flint water crisis is a hoax.
[01:17:45.009 --> 01:17:46.250]  Yeah, because all the water's trash.
[01:17:47.554 --> 01:17:49.815]  Why is Flint's water still unsafe, or is it?
[01:17:50.335 --> 01:17:51.596]  These are all mainstream articles.
[01:17:51.936 --> 01:17:52.596]  Mother Jones.
[01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:59.499]  Yeah, because see, the Democrats kind of at one level don't want to go down this road that the water's poison.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:05.502]  So they're kind of going, oh wait, government's good, water, government gave you good water, everything's okay.
[01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:12.385]  Governor Rick Schneider's chief of staff dismissed Flint people looking for someone to blame.
[01:18:14.238 --> 01:18:17.481]  Ex-FEMA head says Flint water crisis should have used lessons from Katrina.
[01:18:18.462 --> 01:18:20.724]  Flint water crisis isn't the first and won't be the last.
[01:18:21.645 --> 01:18:25.729]  As water problems grew, officials belittled complaints from Flint.
[01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:28.311]  Oh my gosh, that's the New York Times, see?
[01:18:28.632 --> 01:18:30.654]  It's all that Republican white man's fault.
[01:18:31.114 --> 01:18:33.556]  The state is collapsing!
[01:18:35.118 --> 01:18:37.240]  Except the rural areas with the self-sufficient folks.
[01:18:40.657 --> 01:18:41.177]  We're going to go to break.
[01:18:41.197 --> 01:18:44.238]  We're going to come back and see if we've got Leanne from the ground.
[01:18:45.919 --> 01:18:48.180]  And if not, we'll get her on the last 20 minutes of the show today.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:52.782]  Great shot she had there of the water treatment facility right behind her and what I saw before we went live on air.
[01:18:52.802 --> 01:18:55.783]  You can see some of her reports right now on InfoWars.com.
[01:18:55.803 --> 01:18:59.624]  But we're there to get in these press conferences and point out real questions.
[01:18:59.684 --> 01:19:01.105]  What about the fluoride that's added?
[01:19:01.365 --> 01:19:02.605]  What about the other poisons?
[01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:06.187]  Because I'll tell you, the lead in the water is the least of your problems.
[01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:11.453]  We're going to go to break and come back with Leigh-Anne McAdoo after this short break.
[01:19:11.473 --> 01:19:12.214]  We do have her now.
[01:19:13.175 --> 01:19:16.898]  Also, please don't forget, we're in a battle for the Second Amendment right now.
[01:19:16.938 --> 01:19:19.821]  We have a new amazing shirt that's limited edition.
[01:19:19.841 --> 01:19:28.610]  We're selling out of the last sizes of the Hillary for President limited edition at InfoWarsTore.com, so hurry and get those to support the broadcast and meet a lot of like-minded people.
[01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:31.793]  But the all-new, come and take it on the back.
[01:19:32.932 --> 01:19:35.838]  And then on the front it says, we will never surrender.

[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:15.822]  You can run on for a long time with corrupt governments.
[01:24:17.263 --> 01:24:19.685]  You can let them swindle the tax base and rob the people.
[01:24:20.606 --> 01:24:27.912]  But then finally the society collapses and people give up.
[01:24:28.252 --> 01:24:33.916]  But by then the swindlers have moved on to the next country and to their Swiss armored redoubts.
[01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:38.698]  Well, the U.S.
[01:24:38.718 --> 01:24:40.940]  State Department basically says Mexico's a failed state.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.681]  Don't go there with a big travel advisory.
[01:24:43.281 --> 01:24:44.582]  They just say it's completely lawless.
[01:24:46.104 --> 01:24:51.067]  Meanwhile, the New York Times tell us today America's best days are behind it.
[01:24:54.690 --> 01:24:56.331]  And why is its best days behind it?
[01:24:56.351 --> 01:24:59.674]  Because we were brought into debt bondage because we gave up on what made the country great.
[01:25:01.052 --> 01:25:18.487]  But don't worry, we got Michael Moore and the Socialists and Michael Moore of the Democratic Party of the Ku Klux Klan running around teaching quote minorities how everything in the world is because of something a racist white person did when average whites are plunging into poverty as well and are in the exact same boat.
[01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:22.971]  This is Divide and Conquer.
[01:25:24.895 --> 01:25:31.299]  And Michael Moore is a race-baiting pig when he puts out a tweet saying blacks are being genocided because the town is 60% black.
[01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:34.881]  It's 40% other people who are all just humans too, Moore.
[01:25:35.322 --> 01:25:36.883]  How about governments poisoning the water?
[01:25:37.083 --> 01:25:40.305]  How about fluoride's worse for black people than Caucasians or others?
[01:25:41.527 --> 01:25:48.975]  He doesn't care about that, because they're the ones putting it in the water, like the Democrat John P. Holdren admitted in his book, Ecoscience.
[01:25:49.395 --> 01:25:50.457]  And he's the science czar.
[01:25:51.157 --> 01:25:51.798]  Remember that.
[01:25:52.198 --> 01:25:55.182]  These people are monsters and they know what they're doing.
[01:25:55.502 --> 01:26:00.688]  Moore is a controller, meant to look non-threatening in his little outfits.
[01:26:01.589 --> 01:26:03.411]  He is a enemy general.
[01:26:04.448 --> 01:26:05.570]  With armed guards.
[01:26:06.451 --> 01:26:10.678]  Leanne McAdoo, I know it's so cold there that the Skype systems froze.
[01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:14.805]  You're going to be on the last 20 minutes of the third hour today with more updates in your report.
[01:26:15.106 --> 01:26:17.049]  I know you've discovered a lot since you've been there.
[01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:17.930]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:26:19.158 --> 01:26:19.999]  Yes, thank you Alex.
[01:26:20.019 --> 01:26:22.241]  Yeah, we did need to move away from the Flint River.
[01:26:22.261 --> 01:26:23.762]  It was actually frozen there.
[01:26:23.782 --> 01:26:29.226]  I don't know if you saw the video earlier, you could see the icicles hanging there from the toxic waste Flint River.
[01:26:29.727 --> 01:26:33.390]  And yes, it was freezing up the phones, so now we're here inside the vehicle.
[01:26:33.930 --> 01:26:40.395]  We're probably going to move over to a business owner we met earlier today that was talking to us about the water crisis here.
[01:26:41.016 --> 01:26:42.838]  He said we could come on back to his restaurant.
[01:26:42.858 --> 01:26:43.758]  Well, that's great.
[01:26:44.038 --> 01:26:45.600]  We'll get a big update then.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.962]  So far, since you've been on the ground since yesterday, what have you seen?
[01:26:49.158 --> 01:26:57.543]  Well, I have seen just probably some of the most incredibly dilapidated buildings that I've ever witnessed, and people are still living in them.
[01:26:58.083 --> 01:27:03.106]  And so you kind of get a sense of how these people couldn't afford to go buy bottled water.
[01:27:03.366 --> 01:27:06.588]  They don't even have an official grocery store chain here.
[01:27:06.768 --> 01:27:12.231]  So you'll see some parts of town that they're doing okay, and then other parts of town that it's just so
[01:27:13.075 --> 01:27:25.927]  They've been so hard hit by the economy here, and I mean, just experiencing this extreme cold, to think that the government here was telling people not to take hot showers, not to boil the water, things like that.
[01:27:25.967 --> 01:27:32.913]  I mean, just things that we take for granted, being able to get hot water out of the tap to warm us up, you can't do that here.
[01:27:33.093 --> 01:27:34.515]  It's just, it's incredible.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.101]  And the town is a shadow of its former self.
[01:27:37.161 --> 01:27:39.582]  I mean, is there any sense there that it's time to leave the town?
[01:27:39.962 --> 01:27:40.902]  That it's collapsed?
[01:27:40.982 --> 01:27:43.423]  That it's, you know, should be a ghost town for a reason?
[01:27:43.463 --> 01:27:47.825]  It's a toxic waste dump with rotting pipes and the government's feeding them poison water.
[01:27:48.165 --> 01:27:49.706]  I mean, why not just get up and leave?
[01:27:50.848 --> 01:28:06.493]  Well, we were kind of asking ourselves that exact same question, and then we ended up meeting this business owner, a young guy, he's got six kids, and I'm not sure if he bought the building that he's in, but he's got several businesses sort of looped around the building, and they're kind of apocalypse ready up there.
[01:28:06.693 --> 01:28:13.875]  They live and work out of this building and canned foods and the whole bit, but he was able to sort of bypass this crisis because he had
[01:28:14.355 --> 01:28:26.938]  He set up a reverse osmosis system in the building, and so he hadn't been getting the fluoride, getting all of the water, and he said, you know, it was because he didn't trust the fact that the government said, oh, the Flint River is safe, it's perfectly fine.
[01:28:27.258 --> 01:28:31.019]  So he had been testing the water every single month, getting different readings.
[01:28:31.319 --> 01:28:33.659]  And he's been proven correct that it wasn't safe.
[01:28:33.679 --> 01:28:36.400]  Residents that tested water, proven right.
[01:28:37.122 --> 01:28:37.683]  Absolutely.
[01:28:37.983 --> 01:28:41.506]  And that's why it's so important to just filter your own water.
[01:28:41.546 --> 01:28:43.628]  You have no idea what's coming through those pipes.
[01:28:44.128 --> 01:28:53.197]  Now we know that since 2014 and probably even before that, they were well aware that not only was there lead, but they were also having Legionella.
[01:28:53.337 --> 01:29:02.385]  So then we had 10 people actually die from Legionnaire's disease here, and they were trying to prove or disprove that it had something to do with the switching over of the water.
[01:29:02.585 --> 01:29:07.208]  And by the way, Leanne, another report you can do is numbers of deaths in Flint being suppressed.
[01:29:07.448 --> 01:29:12.952]  They always suppress stuff like this, so I would investigate that and see if they're suppressing numbers, see what folks say.
[01:29:12.972 --> 01:29:13.773]  That's one report.
[01:29:14.373 --> 01:29:17.576]  Talk about how it looks like a third world war zone, another report.
[01:29:17.896 --> 01:29:20.217]  Citizens didn't trust government, tested water, proven right.
[01:29:20.458 --> 01:29:30.565]  There are so many reports here that you're going to be breaking down for folks to illustrate what's happening, but it looks like a bellwether for the rest of the country under a post-globalist system.
[01:29:31.778 --> 01:29:37.601]  Right, I mean, the fact that Michael Moore can come in and say it's just a racist thing, I mean, this is happening everywhere.
[01:29:39.122 --> 01:29:39.882]  Leanne, stay there.
[01:29:39.902 --> 01:29:49.288]  I want to do five more minutes with you and get some more angles on this, and then I want to get Larry Nichols on inside the 2016 campaign, Hillary, and more.
[01:29:49.308 --> 01:29:50.848]  Are they planning to bring Biden in?
[01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:52.229]  More on Trump?
[01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:55.551]  More on the ISIS situation?
[01:29:55.891 --> 01:29:57.012]  It's all coming up today.
[01:29:58.653 --> 01:30:01.659]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.601 --> 01:30:05.285]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:19.554]  Serving as a microcosm of the Obama administration, a real estate developer partially demolished the reputed birthplace of the Bill of Rights.
[01:30:19.834 --> 01:30:29.900]  The developer, Triple Crown Corp., secured a permit to demolish a two-story stone building, formerly known as James Bell Tavern, in Silver Springs Township, Pennsylvania.
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:39.049]  By the time a third of the building was destroyed, the city stopped the demolition because officials realized the Bill of Rights was conceived at the tavern during a 1788 meeting.
[01:30:39.069 --> 01:30:39.369]  Commenter W.C.
[01:30:39.389 --> 01:30:41.071]  Handy wrote to the local Sentinel newspaper,
[01:30:49.139 --> 01:30:52.521]  We have a Congress that is so intent on destroying the Bill of Rights.
[01:30:52.801 --> 01:30:57.664]  The building as it stands now is rather indicative of the current state of our Bill of Rights.
[01:30:57.984 --> 01:31:02.346]  Why not leave the building as it is to serve as a reminder to us all, he added.
[01:31:02.606 --> 01:31:06.288]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:16.074]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.

[01:31:33.564 --> 01:31:35.286]  I needed a detox basically.
[01:31:36.067 --> 01:31:39.788]  I've been taking X2 first for about seven days and then I did the deep cleanse.
[01:31:40.288 --> 01:31:43.730]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:44.990]  What do you have to lose?

[01:32:39.249 --> 01:32:40.189]  BrainForce is here.
[01:32:40.389 --> 01:32:42.490]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:47.312]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:32:47.572 --> 01:32:49.232]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[01:32:49.272 --> 01:32:50.733]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:32:50.873 --> 01:32:54.074]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:32:54.354 --> 01:32:56.155]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:32:56.335 --> 01:32:57.235]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:32:57.255 --> 01:32:58.215]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:32:58.435 --> 01:33:00.356]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[01:33:00.436 --> 01:33:06.058]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:10.194 --> 01:33:12.715]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:12.795 --> 01:33:18.998]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:28.823 --> 01:33:29.684]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:33:29.744 --> 01:33:30.825]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:30.925 --> 01:33:47.541]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo and Michael Zimmerman are up in Flint, Michigan, and it reportedly looks like an even more post-apocalyptic, Last Man on Earth, I Am Legend type situation.
[01:33:48.467 --> 01:34:03.010]  And so they're going to be shooting some little mini-documentary pieces about the families that are there, and what's happening, and the deaths, and, you know, are the deaths higher than they've said, and the public doesn't trust them, and are people planning to leave, and Mexico's a failed state.
[01:34:03.670 --> 01:34:04.590]  Many areas of the U.S.
[01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:05.430]  are collapsing.
[01:34:05.450 --> 01:34:10.131]  The police chiefs, as things really degenerate, say, buy guns, protect yourselves.
[01:34:10.511 --> 01:34:14.392]  That's the only thing making the crime rate actually not continue to rise.
[01:34:15.791 --> 01:34:20.254]  So, as things unravel, people get back to reality.
[01:34:21.195 --> 01:34:27.719]  But the problem is, areas that are still doing well have federal, state, and local, and corporations as well, looting everyone.
[01:34:27.739 --> 01:34:30.180]  There's an article up on Infowars.com.
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:33.542]  Feds laugh at, applaud theft of private land.
[01:34:33.783 --> 01:34:35.183]  They actually say, we steal money.
[01:34:35.203 --> 01:34:36.184]  That's a quote.
[01:34:36.524 --> 01:34:38.486]  We always take it for less than it's worth.
[01:34:38.626 --> 01:34:38.966]  Take it.
[01:34:39.949 --> 01:34:45.812]  And they sit there bragging, giving each other basically awards at this ceremony from the BLM.
[01:34:46.232 --> 01:34:52.256]  And man, folks, you go on federal land now, which is supposedly our land, and they'll just walk right up and go, what are you doing?
[01:34:52.296 --> 01:34:56.618]  You'll be standing there with your kids, you're just standing there by a river, and you're like, we're just throwing rocks in the water.
[01:34:57.679 --> 01:34:58.999]  Line up over there, I'm gonna search you.
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:05.363]  And they just look at you like they hate you, and you're like, and it's not the Maine Park Rangers, it's the police.
[01:35:05.423 --> 01:35:07.364]  And people say, well, I thought you don't want to bash the police.
[01:35:08.419 --> 01:35:11.760]  Local police compared to federal police are just night and day.
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:12.901]  And there are some bad cops.
[01:35:12.921 --> 01:35:21.624]  It seems like the more Democrat an area is, Chicago, New York, D.C., I mean, the cops have treated me like I had murdered their children for no reason.
[01:35:21.824 --> 01:35:23.605]  I mean, and they treat everybody else like total crap.
[01:35:25.089 --> 01:35:30.573]  And it's this attitude, and I'm not making it partisan, it's just a fact that I've noticed this out of these people.
[01:35:31.293 --> 01:35:32.534]  They see you as their property.
[01:35:32.574 --> 01:35:42.421]  They want big, poor, dumbed-down populations, living hand-to-mouth, that they can then have a bunch of assistants that they then control that goes to you, they skim off the top.
[01:35:43.021 --> 01:35:45.563]  Like, there are a lot of good foster parents, but there's the known gimmick.
[01:35:46.537 --> 01:35:51.820]  Of, you know, people that warehouse kids and barely feed them and then basically just make a living off foster kids.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:55.361]  And so it's people milking the system and the system's coming down.
[01:35:55.642 --> 01:35:59.824]  So of course they want more illegal aliens pouring into the country so they can then service all of them.
[01:36:00.404 --> 01:36:07.007]  Leanne McAdoo, you're going to be joining us for about 15 minutes at the end of the next hour before we go into the fourth hour today with more updates.
[01:36:07.027 --> 01:36:10.149]  But what else have you witnessed since you got into Michigan yesterday?
[01:36:11.496 --> 01:36:14.098]  Well, just some of the things that we have heard from locals.
[01:36:14.138 --> 01:36:23.365]  People have been warning me on Twitter and other things to just be really careful here because this is a very dangerous city and that's kind of one of these things that, you know, people got to understand.
[01:36:23.405 --> 01:36:31.051]  As people start getting more desperate, they've got nothing to lose and they're going to come after those people that they see are taking advantage of them.
[01:36:31.091 --> 01:36:34.193]  These elite, you know, that's one thing Michael Moore, he's right about.
[01:36:34.233 --> 01:36:37.736]  There's no way that they would have said, here you go, Ann Arbor, Michigan.
[01:36:37.916 --> 01:36:39.998]  We're going to give you this toxic waste dump river.
[01:36:40.018 --> 01:36:41.219]  We're going to pump it through to your city.
[01:36:41.599 --> 01:36:43.400]  That never would have flown in that town.
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:49.724]  So when you are subjecting a certain amount of people that have nothing left to lose, they're going to come after you.
[01:36:49.824 --> 01:36:59.611]  And no amount of safe space that you have built for yourself, you're literally going to have to go fly over to New Zealand to protect yourself from these people who are going to get very angry.
[01:36:59.671 --> 01:37:04.274]  And we're starting to see that happening in these cities that are becoming super desperate.
[01:37:05.416 --> 01:37:07.257]  But again, the cities are collapsing.
[01:37:07.317 --> 01:37:10.780]  It's not the governor's job, in my view, and I agree with what you're saying.
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:27.192]  So they're blablaming the governor, when the governor's telling the Democrat, you know, pimp lords, the Democrat plantation commanders, you know, the grand wizards over there, they're telling them, hey, it's your city, it's your county, you're supposed to run the water district, not us.
[01:37:27.773 --> 01:37:29.774]  And now here comes the feds to save the day.
[01:37:29.794 --> 01:37:30.795]  They're not going to save the day.
[01:37:31.584 --> 01:37:31.784]  Right.
[01:37:31.804 --> 01:37:32.485]  Well, think about it.
[01:37:32.525 --> 01:37:36.046]  I mean, it was the mayor of Detroit that was like, had to be put in prison.
[01:37:36.387 --> 01:37:44.411]  And that was the part of the issue here was that Detroit was making them pay like some of the highest water prices in the nation.
[01:37:44.871 --> 01:37:47.032]  So they wanted to get off Detroit's water.
[01:37:47.133 --> 01:37:49.974]  So Detroit kind of thugged them and said, well, you know what?
[01:37:49.994 --> 01:37:51.635]  We're going to cancel our contract with you.
[01:37:51.915 --> 01:37:52.736]  How do you like that?
[01:37:53.076 --> 01:37:55.797]  So, I mean, it's just a whole thuggish game here.
[01:37:56.298 --> 01:37:58.799]  And the people are the ones who are suffering.
[01:37:58.899 --> 01:37:59.479]  Well, that's it.
[01:37:59.519 --> 01:38:00.320]  I mean, let's say it.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:05.264]  You know, you had all these Germans, Poles, black Americans, you name it, that moved in there in the last hundred years.
[01:38:05.624 --> 01:38:07.405]  The Industrial Revolution, Henry Ford.
[01:38:07.946 --> 01:38:09.146]  It became a big boom town.
[01:38:09.247 --> 01:38:10.628]  Then the mafia moved in.
[01:38:11.428 --> 01:38:13.049]  Organized crime, the unions.
[01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:15.691]  And they took it over, and that's just how it runs.
[01:38:15.711 --> 01:38:19.134]  And as far as I'm concerned, and I've talked to Michiganders, they're great people.
[01:38:19.634 --> 01:38:22.235]  Detroit and Flint aren't part of the state.
[01:38:22.295 --> 01:38:22.855]  They're gone.
[01:38:23.095 --> 01:38:25.496]  You go everywhere else, it's nice, people are doing great, it's wonderful.
[01:38:25.736 --> 01:38:32.138]  You go there, it's a bunch of just, you know, thug kingpins feeding off their people, and that's the end of it.
[01:38:32.218 --> 01:38:33.919]  And of course, this is what you need to expect.
[01:38:33.959 --> 01:38:35.159]  Like Mexico, it's collapsing.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:42.422]  Right, and you have people that do have some money coming back in and trying to reinvigorate the area, but that's because they can buy
[01:38:43.499 --> 01:38:44.200]  I don't think so.
[01:38:54.246 --> 01:39:05.369]  Yeah, and to just bring people into a complete waste town who are going to try and revitalize an area, but the people around them, they don't have jobs, they don't have money, and now they're going to be dealing with lead poisoning for decades.
[01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:12.431]  And of course, lead poisoning, not only does it cause nerve damage, but it also causes tons of behavioral problems, violence.
[01:39:12.832 --> 01:39:19.894]  So, you know, you think this is a criminal city now, a violent city now, where we see really high murder and assault rates and theft.
[01:39:20.274 --> 01:39:23.975]  I mean, imagine in 10 years from now when these kids grow up and they have
[01:39:24.682 --> 01:39:29.747]  The actual effects of lead poisoning, which is going to only exacerbate that kind of behavior.
[01:39:30.027 --> 01:39:32.849]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[01:39:32.909 --> 01:39:34.271]  There's a lot of things happening here.
[01:39:34.491 --> 01:39:37.814]  The country's rotting, it's falling apart, they have corrupt politicians in the area.
[01:39:39.312 --> 01:39:48.835]  But people don't have the survival instinct because they've been raised on welfare, raised in the system in the area, black and white, it's a very poor area, one of the highest welfare rates in the country.
[01:39:49.155 --> 01:39:50.476]  They don't know how to leave.
[01:39:51.056 --> 01:39:52.536]  They don't have family in other areas.
[01:39:52.576 --> 01:39:53.737]  They need to leave.
[01:39:54.017 --> 01:39:55.077]  They need to get out.
[01:39:55.337 --> 01:40:00.019]  You know, Latin America is collapsing, and at least those folks are smart enough to try to get out of it.
[01:40:00.439 --> 01:40:01.220]  I don't blame them.
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:03.683]  The problem is they're being brought here and turned into political weapons.
[01:40:04.163 --> 01:40:06.606]  So folks need to learn how to leave.
[01:40:06.986 --> 01:40:08.107]  That's what people need to do.
[01:40:08.508 --> 01:40:11.031]  Flint needs to disappear.
[01:40:11.351 --> 01:40:12.512]  People need to leave.
[01:40:12.572 --> 01:40:13.233]  It's toxic.
[01:40:13.693 --> 01:40:14.614]  It's out of control.
[01:40:14.975 --> 01:40:16.717]  It's a hundred-year-old industrial site.
[01:40:17.117 --> 01:40:17.558]  It's over.
[01:40:18.925 --> 01:40:24.408]  Yeah, and actually this county, Genesee County, is one of the first anti-slavery establishments.
[01:40:24.428 --> 01:40:32.572]  So this was one of the first places that a lot of black people came and they found all sorts of jobs here, and this place really was booming.
[01:40:32.632 --> 01:40:36.194]  And you look around at some of the homes, some of the architecture, it's beautiful!
[01:40:36.554 --> 01:40:37.094]  Beautiful!
[01:40:37.214 --> 01:40:43.197]  And so you can only imagine how it must have been back in the day, before this got turned into a welfare state.
[01:40:43.497 --> 01:40:44.158]  What happened?
[01:40:44.478 --> 01:40:45.538]  What happened when you had this...
[01:40:47.239 --> 01:40:48.521]  Exactly, and the unions happened.
[01:40:48.541 --> 01:40:55.307]  And of course, folks were smart in the South who were being abused, and the economy wasn't good, period, for anybody.
[01:40:55.548 --> 01:40:56.288]  They left.
[01:40:56.409 --> 01:40:56.709]  See?
[01:40:57.069 --> 01:40:59.191]  The black folks went from the South to the North.
[01:40:59.512 --> 01:41:00.373]  Now it's bad again.
[01:41:00.433 --> 01:41:01.774]  It's time to go back to the South.
[01:41:03.196 --> 01:41:03.636]  Amen.
[01:41:03.836 --> 01:41:05.078]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:41:05.298 --> 01:41:07.400]  You can't save how far gone.
[01:41:07.796 --> 01:41:08.617]  These buildings are.
[01:41:08.637 --> 01:41:13.960]  The lead pipes that are eroded, that are killing your people, like, it's done.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:15.941]  All right, Leanne, we're going to talk to you.
[01:41:16.021 --> 01:41:21.004]  Powerful info coming up at the end of the next hour.
[01:41:21.064 --> 01:41:21.324]  Thank you.
[01:41:21.344 --> 01:41:22.505]  We'll get another update with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:41:22.525 --> 01:41:27.748]  Now, Larry Nichols, who I really appreciate coming on on short notice, is about to join us.
[01:41:27.828 --> 01:41:33.552]  Larry Nichols, we're trying to get connected with him via Skype right now, with huge news on campaign 2016.
[01:41:33.912 --> 01:41:34.112]  Briefly,
[01:41:36.684 --> 01:41:40.186]  We have a lot of new, very important items at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:41:40.487 --> 01:41:43.629]  And one of them has free shipping and 10% off of promo code WATER.
[01:41:43.989 --> 01:41:56.978]  And that is the all-new ProPure shower filter, the ProMax, four-stage, fast-flowing, cuts out or removes 200 contaminants, VOCs, pesticides, fluoride, you name it, glyphosate, you know, the Roundup.
[01:41:57.358 --> 01:42:02.841]  Folks, if you're not doing this, you breathe it, you absorb it through your skin, it's just as important as filtering your water that you drink.
[01:42:03.342 --> 01:42:06.184]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:42:07.104 --> 01:42:11.167]  Now, continuing, you can also call and say promo code WATERING at 10% off and free shipping.
[01:42:11.547 --> 01:42:20.112]  Survival Shield X2, the incredible nascent iodine, the good halogen that's helped me lose so much weight, have so much more energy, help detoxify.
[01:42:20.132 --> 01:42:25.015]  A lot of folks have a detoxification effect, though, unfortunately, about a month into it or less.
[01:42:25.715 --> 01:42:27.256]  But again, then it feels great afterwards.
[01:42:27.276 --> 01:42:28.217]  That's what most folks say.
[01:42:29.317 --> 01:42:33.741]  15% off on that and 15% off Super Female Vitality.
[01:42:34.061 --> 01:42:37.804]  Super Female Vitality is back after being sold out for several months.
[01:42:38.064 --> 01:42:42.628]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:42:42.648 --> 01:42:46.371]  We also have a new We Will Never Surrender Our Guns t-shirt.
[01:42:46.511 --> 01:42:56.779]  And without your purchase of these products, we can't continue, we can't operate, and we can't also be a platform for all these other amazing activists and folks that are taking action.
[01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:57.840]  Now,
[01:42:59.656 --> 01:43:17.542]  Larry Nichols, the big Clinton insider, the guy that was a Green Beret, you name it, special government operations, of course then they didn't hire him, he runs their campaigns, gets them in the governor's office, member of the Dixie Mafia, later learns that the heads of the Dixie Mafia run the Clintons, and the way the Mafia works, he didn't even know who the heads were.
[01:43:18.122 --> 01:43:23.104]  That's how this stuff really works, and of course they were CIA, right out of college, that's been declassified.
[01:43:24.244 --> 01:43:25.165]  Now, the question is,
[01:43:26.129 --> 01:43:27.430]  Will Biden come in?
[01:43:27.630 --> 01:43:35.755]  Now Trump today, and I have the article, I'll pull it out, is basically saying exactly what Larry Nichols said three months ago here on the air.
[01:43:36.015 --> 01:43:40.218]  Trump, Biden would run if Clinton indicted and calls him a ghost candidate.
[01:43:40.538 --> 01:43:43.360]  That's out of MSNBC and Politico.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:50.404]  But he's got inside baseball from his big political contacts on where the movement is right now.
[01:43:50.785 --> 01:43:52.886]  Larry Nichols, thank you for coming on, my friend.
[01:43:53.086 --> 01:43:53.626]  You look good.
[01:43:53.646 --> 01:43:57.047]  I know you've been battling illness, but I tell you, you look better than you looked a few months ago.
[01:43:57.067 --> 01:43:59.967]  So I hope folks prayers are working out there.
[01:44:00.007 --> 01:44:01.207]  Thank you for coming on with that.
[01:44:01.587 --> 01:44:02.328]  Well, thank you.
[01:44:02.468 --> 01:44:06.908]  You know, Alex, it's heading up just like we said, you know, just like we've talked about, buddy.
[01:44:07.608 --> 01:44:09.509]  Let me tell you the inside scoop.
[01:44:10.489 --> 01:44:14.390]  Biden and Elizabeth Warren, they're ready.
[01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:17.010]  They've got their staff set up there.
[01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:18.170]  They're ready to go.
[01:44:18.510 --> 01:44:21.171]  Now, here's the problem, Alex.
[01:44:22.111 --> 01:44:22.491]  Hillary.
[01:44:24.235 --> 01:44:26.256]  Hillary is putting the pressure on them.
[01:44:26.496 --> 01:44:27.877]  They indict her.
[01:44:29.238 --> 01:44:33.440]  And Alex, she's gonna unload on everybody and has made it quite plain.
[01:44:34.181 --> 01:44:41.305]  You indict me, and every secret in Washington will be revealed.
[01:44:41.405 --> 01:44:43.166]  I will not go down alone.
[01:44:43.747 --> 01:44:50.090]  And every member of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, their Senate, they're scared to death.
[01:44:50.611 --> 01:44:52.772]  They're begging Obama, don't.
[01:44:53.476 --> 01:44:55.396]  And of course, Obama's got his agenda.
[01:44:56.717 --> 01:44:59.417]  And it's the battle.
[01:45:00.058 --> 01:45:00.738]  It's the battle.
[01:45:01.118 --> 01:45:05.459]  Now, I know everybody, Alex, tells you, well, Hillary's got to be indicted, got to be indicted.
[01:45:06.559 --> 01:45:09.360]  Let me tell you, she gets indicted.
[01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:09.880]  It's over.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.281]  Washington, as we know it, will be over.
[01:45:13.701 --> 01:45:13.841]  And
[01:45:15.066 --> 01:45:16.047]  The people there know it.
[01:45:16.527 --> 01:45:26.997]  Justice be done, justice be done, may the heavens fall, because the open, naked corruption, unprecedented, and her not getting in trouble, is causing a giant awakening.
[01:45:27.057 --> 01:45:31.241]  So, any way you look at it, this is a no-win situation.
[01:45:31.602 --> 01:45:33.744]  What do you expect the establishment to do?
[01:45:34.224 --> 01:45:35.425]  What's the current movement?
[01:45:35.666 --> 01:45:36.967]  What direction are they going in?
[01:45:37.808 --> 01:45:39.990]  Well, there's absolutely
[01:45:41.899 --> 01:45:44.340]  I got that just this morning.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:48.401]  People, the high-ups in the Democratic Party are calling me, my God, what are we going to do?
[01:45:48.641 --> 01:45:51.922]  Republican high-ups are calling me, my God, what are we going to do?
[01:45:52.522 --> 01:45:55.283]  Let me tell you, everybody is frozen.
[01:45:55.823 --> 01:45:57.604]  Everyone's frozen, Alex.
[01:45:58.764 --> 01:46:03.265]  Hillary has got that city under fear.
[01:46:03.685 --> 01:46:08.787]  It's under the greatest terrorist attack that's ever been known to Washington, D.C.
[01:46:08.967 --> 01:46:09.547]  She has
[01:46:10.487 --> 01:46:13.232]  And so, people in America are wondering, well, wait a minute.
[01:46:13.513 --> 01:46:17.019]  With all this stuff that's so obvious, how can you not indict her?
[01:46:18.129 --> 01:46:19.970]  And so there's pressure from that angle.
[01:46:20.170 --> 01:46:33.736]  The Republican Party, to be quite honest, the reason there's not a lot of stuff happening, you know, between Trump, Cruz, and the establishment and the Republican Party, everybody quite honestly is sitting tight, butts puckered.
[01:46:34.096 --> 01:46:35.937]  What is going to happen?
[01:46:36.397 --> 01:46:38.538]  And so I'm telling you, they're not going to indict Hillary.
[01:46:38.878 --> 01:46:44.701]  They're not going to indict her, because if they do, she is going to reveal everything about every one of them.
[01:46:47.254 --> 01:46:54.338]  Well, as you know, a lot of former federal prosecutors and others are coming out saying the word is an FBI indictment is imminent in the next 40 to 50 days.
[01:46:54.798 --> 01:46:55.899]  Is that just smoke and mirrors?
[01:46:56.279 --> 01:46:58.961]  That's just, well, that's just wishful thinking.
[01:46:59.001 --> 01:47:02.482]  There's a lot of people that think they know this and they think they know that.
[01:47:02.563 --> 01:47:05.364]  And there's no doubt that there's FBI guys.
[01:47:05.484 --> 01:47:06.805]  Alex, you know, they're not bad.
[01:47:06.845 --> 01:47:07.745]  They're not all bad.
[01:47:07.825 --> 01:47:09.086]  They want to indict her.
[01:47:10.211 --> 01:47:10.852]  But they can't.
[01:47:10.972 --> 01:47:13.914]  You see, you can't indict Hillary unless you get Loretta Lynch to do it.
[01:47:13.954 --> 01:47:16.276]  Loretta Lynch is not going to do it unless Obama tells her.
[01:47:17.157 --> 01:47:18.798]  Now what about Biden?
[01:47:18.858 --> 01:47:24.403]  You said you talked to some big insiders and they've even lined up who they plan to run with him.
[01:47:25.584 --> 01:47:25.804]  Right.
[01:47:25.864 --> 01:47:27.806]  Biden and Elizabeth Warren.
[01:47:28.006 --> 01:47:31.529]  That's what they think will be the relief team, the dream team.
[01:47:31.889 --> 01:47:34.051]  If Hillary goes down, they can bring him in.
[01:47:34.691 --> 01:47:35.312]  Problem is,
[01:47:36.078 --> 01:47:39.803]  Uh, Debbie Wasserman Schultz or whatever her name is.
[01:47:39.943 --> 01:47:41.625]  She's, she's fighting hard.
[01:47:41.685 --> 01:47:43.087]  They've even changed the rules.
[01:47:43.147 --> 01:47:44.749]  Now they're going to have another debate.
[01:47:44.969 --> 01:47:49.675]  Everybody's working to try to get Hillary back on track because they're scared to death.
[01:47:50.316 --> 01:47:54.037]  I'm telling you, this is big league, this is big time Alex.
[01:47:54.057 --> 01:48:03.321]  Now six months ago you were saying we gotta take out Hillary politically, but you warned Obama may try to put his dynasty in of Biden.
[01:48:03.361 --> 01:48:04.702]  That's now admitted.
[01:48:05.242 --> 01:48:05.802]  That's right.
[01:48:06.782 --> 01:48:11.804]  But again, I mean, they're part of the same structure but two different heads, I would say.
[01:48:12.264 --> 01:48:14.205]  In your gut, which way is this leaning?
[01:48:14.325 --> 01:48:15.906]  Or are you saying right now it's a stalemate?
[01:48:17.130 --> 01:48:20.552]  This is stalemate, but I'm just telling you right now, Hillary will not be indicted.
[01:48:21.173 --> 01:48:23.835]  They will do everything they can to try to cover it up.
[01:48:23.875 --> 01:48:27.277]  They'll do everything they can to try to rebuild her campaign.
[01:48:27.317 --> 01:48:38.265]  And remember, a lot of this is going to work out to Hillary's favor in the general election because come general election time when she wins, it's all going to be old news and she's going to talk about it.
[01:48:38.365 --> 01:49:00.048]  Alex how the right-wing white guy conspiracy how it tried to bring charges against her how they've done everything to destroy her and she still made it like the Phoenix rising up from the ashes she made it and here she comes now I will say this the only one that can beat Hillary Alex the only one it's Donald Trump Donald Trump
[01:49:01.269 --> 01:49:04.311]  He's the only one that will be able to mix it up with Hillary.
[01:49:04.371 --> 01:49:09.154]  Well, Roger Stone wants the operations to go after the rape and abuse of women.
[01:49:09.214 --> 01:49:12.997]  It seems to be working quite nicely and is damaging her with women.
[01:49:14.017 --> 01:49:14.358]  It is.
[01:49:15.198 --> 01:49:16.619]  It won't stop her.
[01:49:17.219 --> 01:49:18.000]  It won't stop her.
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:25.545]  Alex, remember, this whole election is about people that are committed, that you could catch Hillary
[01:49:26.431 --> 01:49:32.395]  Rape and women herself right on TV and there are people that are going to vote for they're not going to vote against her.
[01:49:32.455 --> 01:49:37.939]  Then you've got the people that would rather vote for the devil himself than to vote for a Republican.
[01:49:38.019 --> 01:49:41.422]  And then you've got the people that would rather do whatever than vote for Donald Trump.
[01:49:41.822 --> 01:49:42.863]  So you've got this.
[01:49:43.904 --> 01:49:45.345]  This is the showdown Alex.
[01:49:45.405 --> 01:49:48.067]  This is that this is the election that our country's
[01:49:49.179 --> 01:49:50.361]  Up for grabs right now.
[01:49:50.822 --> 01:49:52.946]  And that's why we've got to get in.
[01:49:53.327 --> 01:50:00.961]  We, the average American, and I'll say it, the average American white guy, you know, we're being excluded from the whole thing.
[01:50:01.713 --> 01:50:03.435]  You know, we're the dinosaur.
[01:50:03.515 --> 01:50:06.177]  We're the ones that are the endangered species.
[01:50:06.217 --> 01:50:10.861]  Sure, it's the broken coalition strategy that you used to get them into the gubernatorial office.
[01:50:11.322 --> 01:50:14.885]  They've now done where the minorities were walled off before, and they played politics.
[01:50:14.925 --> 01:50:15.966]  Now it's the other way around.
[01:50:16.266 --> 01:50:18.148]  And people are saying, good, get the old white guy.
[01:50:18.548 --> 01:50:20.190]  It's not going to screw the white guy over.
[01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:23.012]  It's a bunch of rich white guys offshore running the whole scam.
[01:50:23.413 --> 01:50:27.877]  They just don't want middle class people, period, that happen to be a lot of them white, to have a say anymore.
[01:50:28.652 --> 01:50:29.113]  That's right.
[01:50:29.353 --> 01:50:31.876]  I mean, they want us out of the pit, Alex.
[01:50:31.936 --> 01:50:33.238]  Remember what I told you years ago?
[01:50:33.258 --> 01:50:39.887]  They want the evil Western culture that's here, you know, of free market and profit gone.
[01:50:40.147 --> 01:50:42.571]  They want a monopoly now and they're getting ready to do it.
[01:50:43.071 --> 01:50:43.492]  That's right.
[01:50:43.993 --> 01:50:46.276]  So, you know, guys, please.
[01:50:47.191 --> 01:50:48.552]  Engage this time.
[01:50:48.652 --> 01:50:55.058]  This will be, and I think you see Alex, everything I've warned about coming to pass, just like a bolt of lightning.
[01:50:55.298 --> 01:50:58.741]  Everything is, everybody now is saying this is it.
[01:50:58.861 --> 01:50:59.662]  Everybody can feel it.
[01:50:59.982 --> 01:51:00.703]  They can see it.
[01:51:01.303 --> 01:51:02.344]  The planets are aligning.
[01:51:02.584 --> 01:51:03.705]  What about a wild car?
[01:51:03.765 --> 01:51:04.886]  She looks, you know, ill.
[01:51:04.926 --> 01:51:05.627]  She looks old.
[01:51:05.647 --> 01:51:08.509]  Then she looks like she's on drugs once she's at the debates.
[01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:13.714]  I mean, you know, maybe God will intercede here and, you know, she'll... I'm working.
[01:51:14.014 --> 01:51:23.644]  I'm working with a story that I probably shouldn't tell, so I won't, that the National Enquirer's fixing to do a story coming out about Hillary's mental capacity and whether or not she is mentally ill.
[01:51:23.684 --> 01:51:24.965]  So that'll be coming out.
[01:51:24.985 --> 01:51:26.567]  Now of course... Let me stop you.
[01:51:26.607 --> 01:51:30.972]  Twice in the last six months, you've said the Enquirer's doing a story on this and then it comes out.
[01:51:30.992 --> 01:51:34.235]  Obviously you're talking to them, so since you said it, tell us.
[01:51:34.735 --> 01:51:35.997]  They're looking at her mental capacity.
[01:51:36.497 --> 01:51:37.237]  Right, they are.
[01:51:37.257 --> 01:51:38.018]  They really are.
[01:51:38.158 --> 01:51:46.280]  She's got health issues, and they're going back and asking me and others that have known her since the beginning, what is it about Hillary?
[01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:49.261]  And Hillary Alex has had a mental issue since day one.
[01:51:49.622 --> 01:51:51.842]  She can't, she does not like people.
[01:51:52.222 --> 01:51:53.083]  She is an animal.
[01:51:53.623 --> 01:52:00.985]  She's everything I've told you she is, and it is a mental problem, and that's what's causing her trouble running this election, to be quite honest.
[01:52:01.486 --> 01:52:04.087]  You can't make her a people person.
[01:52:04.287 --> 01:52:05.267]  You just can't do it.
[01:52:06.258 --> 01:52:07.719]  And so that's where we're at.
[01:52:07.779 --> 01:52:09.680]  But there's going to be stories about that.
[01:52:09.761 --> 01:52:13.943]  But remember, none of these things are going to hurt Hillary.
[01:52:14.164 --> 01:52:14.424]  None.
[01:52:14.804 --> 01:52:15.264]  I'm sorry.
[01:52:15.825 --> 01:52:19.948]  What will stop her and how can Trump crush her?
[01:52:21.028 --> 01:52:22.569]  What'll stop her is me.
[01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.850]  They know it.
[01:52:24.411 --> 01:52:24.831]  I know it.
[01:52:25.932 --> 01:52:27.673]  What'll help is Donald Trump.
[01:52:28.467 --> 01:52:30.427]  You see, Donald Trump can save the nation.
[01:52:30.507 --> 01:52:38.809]  Donald Trump can make a part of his campaign, which I think he will, or can, and that is to issue the power back to the states.
[01:52:38.929 --> 01:52:44.450]  I think if Donald Trump gets in and runs that as his platform, he has a chance of winning.
[01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:47.490]  He'd be like George Washington when they wanted to make him king, refusing.
[01:52:47.770 --> 01:52:56.832]  If he returned the republic, returned the power to the states, said let's get rid of the 17th amendment, where the senators aren't part of the states, if he did that, he'd be George Washington part two.
[01:52:57.152 --> 01:52:57.692]  He would.
[01:52:58.372 --> 01:53:00.794]  And you're just going to have to leave Hillary to me.
[01:53:01.595 --> 01:53:06.019]  You know, it's like I've told you for 20 years, Alex, this is a feature match between me and the bitch.
[01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:10.483]  And all I can say is I'll be there.
[01:53:11.024 --> 01:53:12.585]  I'll be there when it's time.
[01:53:13.402 --> 01:53:23.849]  The main thing I've got to do right now, guys, and I'm telling you, and you see the complexity now, Alex, of the Obama, the Hillary, the Washington, how it's all entangled.
[01:53:24.309 --> 01:53:34.595]  Right now, Hillary and Bill, the power they have is stopping Obama from triggering a crisis that puts us under provisional government, which makes him king.
[01:53:35.176 --> 01:53:38.938]  We've got to get through that period, which is what we're doing right now.
[01:53:40.905 --> 01:53:42.566]  And then it'll be up to us.
[01:53:43.086 --> 01:53:47.449]  And then what I have, and you know what I have, will come out.
[01:53:48.369 --> 01:53:50.511]  Well, I don't want to get killed by a black ops team.
[01:53:50.611 --> 01:53:51.972]  I don't know specifically what you've got.
[01:53:51.992 --> 01:53:52.832]  You don't know all of it.
[01:53:52.852 --> 01:53:53.092]  Right.
[01:53:53.252 --> 01:53:56.894]  I know you have a bunch of dirt on her, and you've been a source of a lot of it over the years coming out.
[01:53:56.914 --> 01:53:59.696]  And I guess you're still alive the way she is.
[01:53:59.736 --> 01:54:01.957]  I guess you've got it in safe places, or why are you still alive?
[01:54:02.978 --> 01:54:04.359]  Well, I'm still alive because they know.
[01:54:05.293 --> 01:54:08.114]  They know that I've got it stashed away in five places.
[01:54:08.194 --> 01:54:11.234]  Anything happens to me, it comes out instantly.
[01:54:11.754 --> 01:54:20.236]  And the fact that something happens to me if I die of this unique accident, Arkansas, if you will, it'll give credence.
[01:54:20.556 --> 01:54:25.457]  Well, Larry, sure, you are the guy behind the Clinton Chronicles, all of it, for folks that are politically ignorant and don't know who you are.
[01:54:25.797 --> 01:54:26.997]  You are a very important person.
[01:54:27.318 --> 01:54:34.119]  I know you're not bluffing about this, but you might be overestimating because who knows how powerful any of us are in the corruption today.
[01:54:34.819 --> 01:54:39.823]  Like you said, she could be raping kids on the White House lawn, she wouldn't get in trouble for it with her mentally ill cult followers.
[01:54:39.883 --> 01:54:48.829]  But, you know, you've said in interviews, I know you were Green Beret, I know you worked for the Clintons, high level, you know, that you particularly have, you know, were a guy that took care of things for them.
[01:54:49.129 --> 01:54:49.910]  Is that the dirt?
[01:54:51.151 --> 01:54:52.232]  Part of it, yes.
[01:54:53.152 --> 01:54:55.474]  I'm just going to tell you... So you know where dead bodies are buried?
[01:54:56.374 --> 01:54:56.755]  You bet.
[01:54:56.915 --> 01:54:57.836]  And I know this.
[01:54:58.496 --> 01:55:02.599]  I know everything is going to key around something called Vince Foster.
[01:55:03.263 --> 01:55:10.148]  There is something about the Vince Foster investigation that will put Hillary down.
[01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:13.631]  Now, remember what I've told you.
[01:55:14.152 --> 01:55:18.275]  If I had her pulling the trigger for Vince Foster, it's not going to get her indicted, right?
[01:55:18.315 --> 01:55:23.299]  If they're not going to indict her over this email scandal, they're not going to indict her over that.
[01:55:23.399 --> 01:55:24.600]  But there's a trick I know.
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:29.123]  Remember, Alex, I helped build the system that's getting them elected, keeping them elected.
[01:55:29.644 --> 01:55:30.785]  I helped build that thing.
[01:55:30.845 --> 01:55:32.306]  I helped design that thing.
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:34.921]  And there's things I can do.
[01:55:35.401 --> 01:55:38.122]  Remember, hey, got Bill Clinton impeached.
[01:55:40.163 --> 01:55:44.085]  And it was much harder then because nobody knew who I was.
[01:55:44.125 --> 01:55:46.946]  Think about Alex, where you and I came from back in those days.
[01:55:48.787 --> 01:55:52.609]  I mean, this is tough, but it's not impossible like that was.
[01:55:53.390 --> 01:56:01.340]  Well back then nobody knew who David Shippers was or anything and Drudge was helping get the word out without Drudge and the Western Journalism Center and you and a few others.
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:04.143]  Now people are a lot more, I'd say a thousand times more awake.
[01:56:04.483 --> 01:56:05.825]  That's really got to threaten the system.
[01:56:07.547 --> 01:56:09.189]  In closing, I know you are fighting
[01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:10.070]  Thank you for having me.
[01:56:29.281 --> 01:56:31.843]  NicholsLive at AOL.com is the PayPal folks.
[01:56:31.883 --> 01:56:36.007]  Supporting Larry Nichols and 58 Kingsington Drive, Conway, Arkansas 72034.
[01:56:36.207 --> 01:56:39.770]  In the minute and a half we got left, we'll do another interview.
[01:56:40.831 --> 01:56:45.395]  What would we expect under a Hillary administration in 70 seconds?
[01:56:46.175 --> 01:56:47.917]  It's gonna be strict communism.
[01:56:48.017 --> 01:56:52.080]  She will take us to a strict communist form of government.
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:53.081]  There will be no doubt.
[01:56:53.121 --> 01:56:56.384]  You know, it's funny, she's running against Bernie Sanders, who's a socialist.
[01:56:57.435 --> 01:56:59.559]  And it makes her look like she's to the right.
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:03.547]  Let me tell you, when Hillary gets elected, two things will happen.
[01:57:03.587 --> 01:57:05.651]  Immediately, we will be reformed.
[01:57:06.275 --> 01:57:08.797]  Organizationally, like you've seen Obama do.
[01:57:08.957 --> 01:57:11.518]  She will reform us as a communist nation, number one.
[01:57:11.558 --> 01:57:18.983]  Number two, she will put Bill Clinton in the UN as our ambassador, and within six months, he'll be the Secretary General of the UN.
[01:57:19.403 --> 01:57:26.828]  And then, their dream, all the way back to 1986, when we put all of this nasty plan together, will have come true.
[01:57:26.868 --> 01:57:29.710]  They will be the most powerful couple in the history of the world.
[01:57:30.090 --> 01:57:31.791]  And you were in the room planning this?
[01:57:32.453 --> 01:57:33.874]  I was in the room planning it.
[01:57:33.974 --> 01:57:35.234]  I wrote some of the stuff.
[01:57:35.254 --> 01:57:35.775]  No, I know.
[01:57:35.855 --> 01:57:39.436]  Clinton has written about you in his memoirs and admits a lot of it.
[01:57:39.477 --> 01:57:40.617]  It's just surreal.
[01:57:41.397 --> 01:57:45.659]  Larry Nichols, my friend, look, you did look like you were on death's doorstep about two months ago.
[01:57:45.679 --> 01:57:46.260]  I know.
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:47.280]  Are you doing better now?
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:47.700]  You look good.
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:48.201]  Doing better.
[01:57:48.321 --> 01:57:48.901]  Doing better.
[01:57:49.141 --> 01:57:52.463]  It's just a matter of, you know, hey, people will help.
[01:57:52.523 --> 01:57:53.163]  I'll be in there.
[01:57:53.543 --> 01:57:58.105]  Hey, if I gotta crawl, if I gotta crawl on my teeth, I'll be there, Alex.
[01:57:58.145 --> 01:57:58.886]  You know I will.
[01:57:59.534 --> 01:58:05.556]  All right, brother, be safe and we'll talk to you and get an update again next week as things develop very quickly with the Iowa caucuses and the rest of it.
[01:58:05.596 --> 01:58:06.036]  Larry Nichols.
[01:58:06.457 --> 01:58:06.977]  Thank you.
[01:58:07.137 --> 01:58:08.037]  Thank you so much, buddy.
[01:58:08.117 --> 01:58:08.497]  You bet.
[01:58:08.857 --> 01:58:13.979]  You know, I talked to that guy off air and I won't even let him tell me stuff because I just I don't want to know it unless it's on air.
[01:58:13.999 --> 01:58:15.080]  Let me tell you, it's real.
[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:16.140]  It's real.
[01:58:17.281 --> 01:58:17.421]  And.
[01:58:19.071 --> 01:58:21.152]  If this country is in so much trouble, God help us.
[01:58:21.513 --> 01:58:29.157]  That's why we don't need to promote George Soros stuff to, you know, Black Lives Matter, go shoot cops in the back of the head and all the rest of this bull.
[01:58:29.537 --> 01:58:35.701]  We need to go expose bad cops and bad bureaucrats and bad politicians, but we need to really expose the big war at the top going on.
[01:58:36.081 --> 01:58:38.664]  I mean, the globalists we got running things are so crazy.
[01:58:38.864 --> 01:58:43.768]  They're starting a war with Russia and turning Al-Qaeda loose everywhere, and now starting a war with China.
[01:58:44.069 --> 01:58:46.811]  They just put a big fighter wing on readiness in Japan.
[01:58:46.831 --> 01:58:48.213]  I mean, it's getting serious.
[01:58:48.233 --> 01:58:48.793]  Stay with us.
[01:58:49.113 --> 01:58:51.776]  Third hour straight ahead with Wayne Madsen and more.
[01:58:53.417 --> 01:58:55.439]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:59.599 --> 01:59:00.500]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:00.960]  Good, brother.
[01:59:01.121 --> 01:59:02.843]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:59:02.863 --> 01:59:04.664]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:59:04.805 --> 01:59:08.809]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:59:08.829 --> 01:59:11.412]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:59:11.452 --> 01:59:13.674]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:59:13.874 --> 01:59:21.723]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:59:22.043 --> 01:59:25.144]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:59:25.284 --> 01:59:26.785]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:59:26.805 --> 01:59:29.726]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:59:29.746 --> 01:59:31.227]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:59:31.507 --> 01:59:37.309]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[01:59:37.889 --> 01:59:40.170]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:21.122 --> 02:00:25.783]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:50.083 --> 02:00:51.564]  Playin' rock and roll!
[02:00:52.124 --> 02:00:53.565]  Gettin' rocked!
[02:00:53.926 --> 02:00:55.367]  Gettin' stoned!
[02:00:55.747 --> 02:00:58.008]  Gettin' beat up!
[02:00:58.108 --> 02:00:59.810]  Broken bones!
[02:01:00.370 --> 02:01:01.631]  Gettin' had!
[02:01:02.491 --> 02:01:03.212]  Gettin' took!
[02:01:04.072 --> 02:01:05.033]  I'm here to tell ya!
[02:01:05.453 --> 02:01:07.815]  I tell ya folks, it's harder than it looks!
[02:01:09.355 --> 02:01:11.516]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[02:01:11.536 --> 02:01:12.077]  to 3 p.m.
[02:01:12.117 --> 02:01:15.358]  Central, four hours of hard-hitting radio slash TV.
[02:01:15.859 --> 02:01:20.581]  Back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central, for another hour of hard-hitting information warfare.
[02:01:21.082 --> 02:01:24.183]  Then we return Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:01:24.363 --> 02:01:25.464]  Central Standard Time.
[02:01:31.511 --> 02:01:37.013]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll have Leanne McAdoo the last 15 minutes popping in from Flint, Michigan and what she's discovering.
[02:01:37.313 --> 02:01:38.913]  She's doing a great job breaking down the facts.
[02:01:38.933 --> 02:01:48.296]  She's going to do a bunch of special reports for the Nightly News and more up there with our intrepid cameraman, Michael Zimmerman.
[02:01:48.336 --> 02:01:49.696]  So that is all coming up.
[02:01:49.736 --> 02:01:53.217]  I've got a bunch of clips I want to get to that I haven't covered yet.
[02:01:54.309 --> 02:02:04.605]  I want to also get into some of the things that are happening over in Europe, the Islamic invasion accelerating and a lot more.
[02:02:04.725 --> 02:02:08.791]  And I also wanted to open the phones up for your specific
[02:02:09.372 --> 02:02:12.694]  Questions or comments about anything that's been happening.
[02:02:13.094 --> 02:02:21.278]  Wayne Madsen's one of those guests where even though he's coming on about specific topics, he is smart on basically everything and can comment on it.
[02:02:21.338 --> 02:02:23.279]  But particularly the phones are open.
[02:02:23.579 --> 02:02:25.840]  Report US harbors ISIS-linked terrorists.
[02:02:26.341 --> 02:02:29.442]  US changes status of ISIS-linked group to protected organization.
[02:02:30.643 --> 02:02:34.605]  That's a Wayne Madsen report at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:02:34.925 --> 02:02:35.525]  And another one.
[02:02:35.925 --> 02:02:38.687]  Report globalists covering up jihadist violence.
[02:02:40.379 --> 02:02:44.221]  International agreement between some nations to downplay migrant crisis.
[02:02:44.801 --> 02:02:47.063]  So we're going to be looking at all of that with him.
[02:02:47.083 --> 02:02:50.905]  We're going to be looking at America's best days behind it.
[02:02:50.925 --> 02:02:52.125]  The New York Times says.
[02:02:53.586 --> 02:03:02.851]  And how that ties in with the whole Cloward and Piven type strategy where they have a amalgamation of communism and fascism.
[02:03:04.787 --> 02:03:11.932]  Absorbing what was left of free market capitalism and Americana and western culture and renaissance.
[02:03:12.692 --> 02:03:23.559]  And so the elites are offshore in a trifecta above the communism, above the fascism, above the nation states, exempt from all the regulations and rules with diplomatic immunity on record.
[02:03:25.131 --> 02:03:26.813]  Playing everyone off against each other.
[02:03:27.614 --> 02:03:29.396]  I mean, how could they not take the world over?
[02:03:30.297 --> 02:03:39.048]  It's an ingenious plan, but only if the public is financially, culturally, spiritually, geopolitically as ignorant as a goldfish.
[02:03:39.849 --> 02:03:41.771]  With the memory of a goldfish.
[02:03:42.756 --> 02:03:45.818]  In fact, I believe our new national symbol, actually, I thought a lot about this.
[02:03:46.499 --> 02:03:48.000]  Should it be a buzzard eating dead meat?
[02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:53.264]  Should it be a guy, you know, TSA sticking their hand, you know, down your pants?
[02:03:53.965 --> 02:03:55.506]  And actually, I think it should be a goldfish.
[02:03:57.928 --> 02:04:07.115]  Goofy, stupid, ineffectual, doesn't mean anything, and has about a 30-second, 30-second understanding of the world.
[02:04:08.516 --> 02:04:11.218]  And I really feel
[02:04:12.399 --> 02:04:17.440]  Bad, having to admit how far we've fallen, but you have to do that before you turn things around.
[02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:19.381]  You have to have a total rejection of the system.
[02:04:19.721 --> 02:04:33.904]  And you've got just flagrant, explosive, tectonic, colossal, violent, hemorrhaging, stinking mountains of corruption just flooding out.
[02:04:34.684 --> 02:04:35.604]  And nobody gets in trouble.
[02:04:36.561 --> 02:04:39.603]  We have all this new BLM footage that's up on Infowars.com.
[02:04:40.864 --> 02:04:43.646]  Feds laugh at applaud theft of private land.
[02:04:44.447 --> 02:04:47.389]  They use words like, terms like, yeah, we stole the money.
[02:04:47.669 --> 02:04:48.570]  Yeah, we took the land.
[02:04:48.610 --> 02:04:49.311]  Yeah, we stole it.
[02:04:49.571 --> 02:04:55.415]  They all laugh and snicker, just like in surveillance footage and stuff you see of criminals robbing a bank.
[02:04:55.696 --> 02:05:01.400]  Everybody's tied up and they'll just pistol whip somebody for no reason and make jokes and, you know, this is their attitude.
[02:05:02.801 --> 02:05:04.022]  I mean, this is who we're ruled by.
[02:05:04.122 --> 02:05:05.303]  We're in deep trouble.
[02:05:09.699 --> 02:05:16.524]  The Democratic Party establishment that wants to install Hillary into the White House in this next election season is currently in free fall.
[02:05:16.705 --> 02:05:24.751]  The plan for potential first husband Bill Clinton has failed miserably as women have crawled out of the woodwork to describe his detailed history of sexual abuse.
[02:05:25.051 --> 02:05:30.756]  She also has the looming email scandal which doesn't seem to go away no matter how many jokes she throws at it.
[02:05:30.896 --> 02:05:32.517]  The latest news comes out of Beaumont where
[02:05:32.517 --> 02:05:35.498]  For only six people were at the airport to greet the former first lady.
[02:05:35.638 --> 02:05:39.280]  KDFM reported that she didn't say hello or visit any of those six people.
[02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:40.460]  She just drove away.
[02:05:40.641 --> 02:05:41.481]  And where was she going?
[02:05:41.761 --> 02:05:45.983]  Oh, to a private fundraiser held by Pakistani businessman Tahir Javid to collect $500,000.
[02:05:46.183 --> 02:05:49.304]  The news reported it as a private meeting.
[02:05:49.544 --> 02:05:53.046]  Back in 2008, she attended another private meeting with Barack Obama.
[02:05:53.206 --> 02:05:56.870]  This occurred, of course, in Chantilly, Virginia, during the Bilderberg meeting.
[02:05:57.090 --> 02:06:02.115]  In fact, her campaign has become so desperate, she's now labeling Bernie Sanders as a white elitist.
[02:06:02.336 --> 02:06:03.997]  Read the article at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:04.118 --> 02:06:05.819]  Bernie Sanders, very white.
[02:06:05.979 --> 02:06:09.103]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:06:09.503 --> 02:06:14.306]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[02:08:06.728 --> 02:08:15.456]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:45.891 --> 02:08:51.958]  Well, a fighter wing of fighter bombers has been moved to Japan to face the Communist Chinese.
[02:08:54.085 --> 02:09:03.271]  The British government has come out in squarely leveled blame for the radiation poisoning a decade ago of a former KGB officer.
[02:09:03.291 --> 02:09:04.552]  That's so they can get new sanctions.
[02:09:05.372 --> 02:09:15.538]  We have a stack of news here about radical jihadis raping, stabbing, killing aid workers, running around thumbing at the mouth, governments banning speech against them across Europe.
[02:09:15.618 --> 02:09:15.839]  I mean...
[02:09:16.559 --> 02:09:21.082]  We are definitely in the hands of some very sadistic, wicked, crazy people that hate us.
[02:09:21.582 --> 02:09:30.668]  They're called communists, they're called socialists that work for big mega-banks, who are above the law and tax-exempt, and are meeting right now high atop the highest resort in Switzerland, Davos.
[02:09:31.268 --> 02:09:36.072]  And with the breakdown on what's happening inside Davos, with the breakdown on what's going on geopolitically,
[02:09:36.892 --> 02:09:39.614]  InfoWars.com reporter, Wayne Madsen.
[02:09:39.654 --> 02:09:41.576]  He also has WayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:09:41.596 --> 02:09:42.757]  He's also a best-selling author.
[02:09:43.057 --> 02:09:43.878]  Find his books there.
[02:09:44.879 --> 02:09:46.240]  He's going to be covering a lot of the election.
[02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:48.382]  In fact, I think I'm going to try to send him the RNC and DNC.
[02:09:48.422 --> 02:09:50.323]  We're getting accredited right now.
[02:09:50.383 --> 02:09:56.128]  I'll probably go to some of those as well, along with David Knight and Jakari Jackson, Lee Ann Mack, and some of the other crew this year.
[02:09:56.148 --> 02:10:02.213]  And of course, our political correspondent, Richard Reeves, up in Iowa, who's been popping in.
[02:10:02.233 --> 02:10:04.255]  I mean, we're building a real news organization here.
[02:10:04.876 --> 02:10:07.848]  And Wayne Madsen is formerly NSA, of course, and also written for.
[02:10:09.008 --> 02:10:11.990]  Miami Herald, you name it, some of the biggest newspapers in the country.
[02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:30.002]  I'm not going to go over all of those, but the two big articles that I saw, and the reason I wanted to get him on today was one yesterday on Infowars.com, and now today, report globalists covering up jihadist violence, international agreement between some nations to downplay migrant crisis.
[02:10:30.022 --> 02:10:31.503]  Yeah, they're agreeing not to report it.
[02:10:32.043 --> 02:10:34.865]  I mean, it really shows how they use political correctness.
[02:10:36.035 --> 02:10:39.596]  To cover up an attempt at genocide against cultures, report U.S.
[02:10:39.636 --> 02:10:41.537]  harbors ISIS-linked terrorist.
[02:10:42.057 --> 02:10:42.297]  U.S.
[02:10:43.217 --> 02:10:46.578]  changes status of ISIS-linked group to protected organization.
[02:10:47.299 --> 02:10:48.879]  Well, of course, they've been running the whole thing.
[02:10:49.519 --> 02:10:53.541]  But how does it break that narrative when somebody like Donald Trump comes out and talks about it?
[02:10:53.881 --> 02:10:54.881]  Look how far we've come.
[02:10:55.581 --> 02:11:03.684]  From Wayne and I talking about the Syrian Civil War five years ago, starting Western-backed, and al-Nusra being al-Qaeda, to today, we're not called conspiracy terrorists.
[02:11:04.687 --> 02:11:05.929]  Well, Wayne's been to Damascus.
[02:11:05.969 --> 02:11:07.410]  He's been over there during the Civil War.
[02:11:07.611 --> 02:11:08.452]  He's been to Libya.
[02:11:09.918 --> 02:11:14.899]  So, you know, that's what these journalists do, is actually get on the ground, not just repeat what the White House says.
[02:11:14.939 --> 02:11:16.720]  So, so much is going on.
[02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:18.420]  The global markets are melting down.
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:25.482]  As soon as Soros came out three weeks ago and said, the plunge is here, everyone dutifully started the plunge, because it's staged.
[02:11:25.542 --> 02:11:27.963]  And they now admit that, three years ago in Rolling Stone.
[02:11:28.743 --> 02:11:29.643]  And the New York Times.
[02:11:29.783 --> 02:11:31.164]  Okay, the stock market's rigged.
[02:11:31.344 --> 02:11:32.964]  Okay, the currency rates are rigged.
[02:11:33.064 --> 02:11:35.265]  Okay, the interest rates are rigged with LIBOR.
[02:11:36.317 --> 02:11:40.819]  What a world now, though, where I thought they'd all go to jail for it or something might stop.
[02:11:40.879 --> 02:11:46.282]  Instead, they have BLM meetings and forestry meetings where they go, we steal money in houses!
[02:11:46.322 --> 02:11:46.982]  We're proud of it!
[02:11:47.002 --> 02:11:55.006]  I mean, again, it's like cartoons when I was a kid that would show the Legion of Doom having an awards ceremony and giving criminals awards.
[02:11:55.907 --> 02:11:58.088]  And I thought, and people doing horrible things, awards.
[02:11:58.648 --> 02:11:59.769]  And I thought, that's ridiculous.
[02:11:59.789 --> 02:12:04.231]  But the more I grow up, I see, I go, wait, whoever wrote that knew what they were talking about.
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:08.342]  Let's give Obama five more peace prizes.
[02:12:09.183 --> 02:12:10.204]  I mean, what a sick world.
[02:12:10.244 --> 02:12:14.187]  Wayne, I kind of set the table here for the hour on how crazy everything's getting.
[02:12:14.908 --> 02:12:19.912]  Just generally on the state of the world and where you see it going and just all of it.
[02:12:20.213 --> 02:12:24.416]  And then we'll drill into Davos, drill into the jihadis and the rest of it.
[02:12:24.436 --> 02:12:25.617]  But first off, Happy New Year.
[02:12:26.158 --> 02:12:26.838]  Great to have you here with us.
[02:12:26.858 --> 02:12:29.581]  I guess you've already been on since the year started, but here we are, my friend.
[02:12:32.837 --> 02:12:38.443]  2016 is going to turn out to be a very interesting year, both domestically and internationally.
[02:12:38.463 --> 02:12:45.730]  You mentioned the latest report, which was commissioned by the British.
[02:12:45.810 --> 02:12:51.055]  It was another one of these British judges they hauled out of the Old Bailey in London.
[02:12:51.475 --> 02:12:54.739]  You know, that's a place that V, you know, V for Vendetti, blew it up.
[02:12:56.220 --> 02:13:01.644]  But they hauled some judge out who said that Vladimir Putin killed this guy Litvinenko.
[02:13:02.285 --> 02:13:16.457]  Clearly it was all signs pointed to Litvinenko's employer, a guy named Boris Berezovsky, being responsible for getting rid of Litvinenko because Litvinenko was probably a double agent.
[02:13:17.197 --> 02:13:22.181]  And he wanted to get rid of him because Litvinenko found out too much about this Berezovsky.
[02:13:22.221 --> 02:13:29.046]  He was an exiled Russian oligarch who had been the king of all Russian media at one point in time.
[02:13:29.847 --> 02:13:36.252]  And like many of these oligarchs like Khodorkovsky and Nedzhlin, they all hightailed out of Russia because they owed taxes.
[02:13:36.852 --> 02:13:42.796]  Well, Sherry, this guy was pretty low-level, and they've made such a big deal for 10 years, now squarely blaming it on Putin.
[02:13:42.816 --> 02:13:45.737]  And I read the report, no evidence, no nothing.
[02:13:45.817 --> 02:13:49.479]  Why haven't the Russians come out then and said, he was our double agent?
[02:13:49.519 --> 02:13:51.901]  Why do they have this policy of never even defending themselves?
[02:13:52.441 --> 02:14:03.186]  Well, I mean, it gets into the intelligence thing because if they admitted to that, you know, he had infiltrated the Chechen movement, for example, the exiled Chechens abroad.
[02:14:03.207 --> 02:14:13.532]  Now, this is the same movement that spawned Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the two accused bombers in the Boston Marathon bombing.
[02:14:13.572 --> 02:14:17.874]  So, you know, the Russians had a lot of intelligence on them, too, all of it.
[02:14:18.214 --> 02:14:23.916]  Which was ignored by our FBI, I would add, and also the Obama administration.
[02:14:24.376 --> 02:14:40.481]  But they try to say that because there was traces of polonium being left all over London because this guy Litvinenko supposedly ate some radioactive sushi that was sprinkled with polonium dust in some Japanese restaurant in London.
[02:14:40.961 --> 02:14:42.442]  By the way, that same polonium
[02:14:43.022 --> 02:14:55.892]  This is the same British line of inquiry that ruled that Dr. David Kelly, the WMD expert, actually committed suicide.
[02:14:55.952 --> 02:14:56.873]  That he wasn't murdered.
[02:14:56.933 --> 02:14:59.194]  Everybody in England knows he was murdered.
[02:14:59.515 --> 02:15:07.060]  This is the same judicial line of inquiry that said that there was nothing to the Tony Blair dodgy dossier.
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:09.442]  These are the people that covered up the pedophile scandal?
[02:15:09.462 --> 02:15:10.163]  I don't think so.
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:28.885]  In Britain and they're easily paid for as we've seen with about 10 of them.
[02:15:29.005 --> 02:15:33.471]  Well obviously getting major traction is just a way to demonize Russia and accelerate tensions.
[02:15:33.951 --> 02:15:36.214]  Are they going to be successful kicking off a new Cold War?
[02:15:36.634 --> 02:15:42.922]  Seems like the American people and Donald Trump and everybody else just don't want to have bad relations with Russia and are sick of all this.
[02:15:43.854 --> 02:15:52.122]  Yeah, I mean, you know, Russia and now we've got the sabres being rattled against China.
[02:15:52.142 --> 02:16:02.132]  I would note that I saw a photograph of the Australian Prime Minister Turnbull being entertained by the commander of the US Pacific Forces in Pearl Harbor.
[02:16:02.792 --> 02:16:05.375]  They had a photo op outside the Admiral's home.
[02:16:05.815 --> 02:16:09.698]  I noticed that the Admiral didn't have his cover on, his headgear.
[02:16:10.599 --> 02:16:12.140]  And what's happened to the Navy?
[02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:13.742]  That guy was out of uniform.
[02:16:14.062 --> 02:16:19.487]  When I was an officer, we could never, or any, no Navy person could be outside without a cover.
[02:16:19.507 --> 02:16:26.693]  So he decides to ditch his cover so he can get a photo op because he was trying to tell an Australian Prime Minister, look,
[02:16:27.293 --> 02:16:30.314]  The Chinese are going to turn the Pacific into a Chinese lake.
[02:16:30.334 --> 02:16:36.297]  You know, we've got to get to battle stations and rev up for a war with the Chinese.
[02:16:36.357 --> 02:16:38.457]  I mean, how retro can you get with these?
[02:16:39.058 --> 02:16:46.060]  I can understand why the Admiral would be pushing that because he, you know, he's looking to get a job with Lockheed Martin after he retires.
[02:16:46.140 --> 02:16:49.622]  So the more... We won't be anywhere to spend the money if we have a nuclear war.
[02:16:50.578 --> 02:16:56.804]  Well, you know, look, the history of Pearl Harbor and Admirals isn't one that I would put on my resume.
[02:16:56.824 --> 02:16:59.166]  They have a pretty bad history over there.
[02:16:59.886 --> 02:17:02.989]  When they should be worried about wars, they aren't.
[02:17:04.310 --> 02:17:11.157]  They got hit with the Japanese attack, and when they shouldn't be worried about wars, they're beating the war drums.
[02:17:11.197 --> 02:17:15.220]  You know, they spend too much time... Well, we know the truth.
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:16.642]  The Admirals stood down.
[02:17:17.182 --> 02:17:18.143]  Sure, but we know the truth.
[02:17:18.183 --> 02:17:28.128]  They stood down to get us into the war, not defending the Japanese, but that we set them up, sent the carriers out, and you know, the Spanish-American War in 1898, that was a false flag with the sinking of the main.
[02:17:28.148 --> 02:17:40.714]  Yeah, and of course, on December 7, 1941, all of Admiral Harris's predecessors over there were sleeping off a hangover from Saturday night.
[02:17:40.834 --> 02:17:43.136]  Nothing ever changes in Pearl Harbor, I'm afraid.
[02:17:44.396 --> 02:17:45.157]  Well, it is pretty.
[02:17:45.537 --> 02:17:55.245]  Now, expanding on this now, before we get into the radical Islamicists and what's behind that and the flooding of Europe and the rest of the world with them and some of the interesting discoveries you found about U.S.
[02:17:55.285 --> 02:17:57.227]  harboring ISIS groups inside the U.S.
[02:17:57.247 --> 02:17:59.128]  I mean, this should be a national story.
[02:17:59.709 --> 02:18:02.671]  Hopefully listeners can make it one so we can force some sunlight on this.
[02:18:03.452 --> 02:18:06.915]  Election 2016, Hillary, how much trouble is she in?
[02:18:06.935 --> 02:18:09.837]  Do you think they'll really run Biden with Elizabeth Warren?
[02:18:10.238 --> 02:18:12.780]  Or what's the intel Wayne Madsen's got on that right now?
[02:18:13.601 --> 02:18:17.944]  Well, the DNC is getting nervous about Hillary.
[02:18:18.645 --> 02:18:22.027]  You mentioned earlier the email scandals not going away.
[02:18:22.087 --> 02:18:24.609]  Now it turns out that she had higher than top secret.
[02:18:24.910 --> 02:18:26.611]  That's compartmentalized information.
[02:18:26.931 --> 02:18:31.895]  And people have gone to jail for long periods of time when they misuse that type of information.
[02:18:31.915 --> 02:18:32.796]  Petraeus did far less.
[02:18:33.789 --> 02:18:39.573]  Yeah, even stuff that's not compartmented, people have gone to prison for a long time.
[02:18:39.633 --> 02:18:42.415]  So that's a festering sore that's not going away.
[02:18:42.435 --> 02:18:56.665]  I'll tell you, there's also a documentary out called Wiener about Anthony Wiener, and apparently there's some really awkward information in there about Hillary Clinton and her longtime assistant, Wiener's wife, Huma Abedin.
[02:18:58.827 --> 02:19:02.129]  Well, many years ago, I happened to have been in Hollywood.
[02:19:04.123 --> 02:19:09.245]  Up in Beverly Hills, when Hillary was there, it was a three-day weekend.
[02:19:09.265 --> 02:19:20.189]  It was actually the Columbus Day weekend, and the rumors were rampant around Hollywood and Beverly Hills about what Hillary was doing out there at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
[02:19:20.729 --> 02:19:26.451]  I'll let people's imagination figure out the rest of that story, but I think that's when they say this movie's awkward.
[02:19:26.491 --> 02:19:27.732]  That's what they're talking about.
[02:19:28.072 --> 02:19:35.561]  Yes, there's an awkward situation with Hillary's marriage, as there is with Huma Abedin's marriage to Anthony Weiner.
[02:19:36.983 --> 02:19:38.785]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:39.205 --> 02:19:43.469]  Looking at the Islamic situation, Wayne Madsen, which should we tackle first when we come back?
[02:19:43.529 --> 02:19:44.590]  Report U.S.
[02:19:44.630 --> 02:19:46.052]  harbors ISIS-linked terrorists?
[02:19:46.412 --> 02:19:49.435]  Or do you want to hit report globalists covering up jihadist violence?
[02:19:50.236 --> 02:19:55.441]  Well, I think that that's the one that is really of immediate concern for people in Europe.
[02:19:55.461 --> 02:19:57.663]  Now we can get the other one segues easily.
[02:19:58.183 --> 02:19:59.164]  And to the other story.
[02:19:59.224 --> 02:20:00.605]  All right, Wayne Madsen, stay there.
[02:20:00.705 --> 02:20:01.546]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:23:38.973 --> 02:23:40.574]  We're introducing the best yet.
[02:23:40.714 --> 02:23:44.616]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[02:23:44.776 --> 02:23:49.379]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.

[02:24:13.905 --> 02:24:15.346]  Wayne Madsen's a trailblazer.
[02:24:15.686 --> 02:24:17.166]  He's not a follower, he's a leader.
[02:24:18.227 --> 02:24:20.588]  That's the type of reporters we have at InfoWars.com.
[02:24:23.009 --> 02:24:24.630]  We analyze breaking news.
[02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:26.450]  We cover other people's breaking stories.
[02:24:27.871 --> 02:24:29.812]  We're not in competition with the rest of the media.
[02:24:29.852 --> 02:24:31.412]  We're in competition with media that lies.
[02:24:31.813 --> 02:24:32.473]  We expose them.
[02:24:34.512 --> 02:24:40.275]  And more and more, the news we cover, what we focus on is becoming the talking points around the country and the world.
[02:24:40.615 --> 02:24:43.156]  That shows how weak the establishment media has gotten.
[02:24:43.196 --> 02:24:45.537]  I'll talk about that more coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:45.557 --> 02:24:49.919]  If you've got questions for Wayne Madsen on any subject, we'll take a few calls.
[02:24:49.939 --> 02:24:50.299]  800-259-9231.
[02:24:50.319 --> 02:24:50.359]  800-259-9231.
[02:24:58.137 --> 02:25:02.520]  Going back to Wayne, before he leaves us, he'll be with us with McAdoo as well at the end of the hour.
[02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:04.962]  We're going to look at what's happening in Flint, but later.
[02:25:06.163 --> 02:25:11.507]  It's all part of this overall breakdown of the civilization, but also breakdown in trust in the system.
[02:25:12.307 --> 02:25:19.573]  I don't want to not have trust in a system, but you can't trust a predatory system that has to die, even though that's going to be painful.
[02:25:20.233 --> 02:25:21.494]  I want a social compact.
[02:25:22.595 --> 02:25:23.516]  I'm not an anarchist.
[02:25:24.565 --> 02:25:29.929]  But what we have is totally inequitable.
[02:25:30.329 --> 02:25:42.139]  And if you look at Davos, with the richest people in the world that have half the world's wealth, almost all of them got it through inside government contract deals, crony deals, lecturing the free market that it did something,
[02:25:43.206 --> 02:25:52.652]  To destroy what's left of it and transfer the money themselves while flooding Europe and the United States with unskilled workers and radical jihadists.
[02:25:53.293 --> 02:26:00.578]  Obviously, destabilization is the plan, but do they think we're really this dumb to go along with it, or is it such a will?
[02:26:02.365 --> 02:26:04.968]  To break our back that they just don't care.
[02:26:05.288 --> 02:26:08.711]  Wayne Madsen, I'm kind of ranting here, but this ties into your report.
[02:26:09.712 --> 02:26:11.734]  In fact, we'll cover more of the Islamic stuff in a moment.
[02:26:12.055 --> 02:26:12.595]  Davos.
[02:26:12.875 --> 02:26:26.629]  I mean, these guys really are the bad guys meeting, as you've exposed, and they're just so arrogant up there lecturing Westerners on how we're not paying enough taxes and how we're the reason there's inequity when it's the elite are the authors of it.
[02:26:27.881 --> 02:26:40.551]  Well, I look at where they're meeting in Davos, and you've got snow-drenched mountains all around that village, and if there was ever a need for an avalanche, I can't think of a better time than now.
[02:26:42.653 --> 02:26:57.085]  But yeah, Davos and Bilderberg, these people, they love to get together and plot behind these closed doors at these she-she resort areas.
[02:26:57.845 --> 02:26:59.966]  And they lecture the rest of the world.
[02:27:00.486 --> 02:27:02.547]  Rest assured that George Soros is there.
[02:27:02.567 --> 02:27:04.087]  He wouldn't miss a Davos meeting.
[02:27:04.447 --> 02:27:12.110]  And probably that weasel Henry Kissinger has been wheeled in there in his wheelchair from his private jet.
[02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:14.911]  So yeah, you've got all these insidious players.
[02:27:14.971 --> 02:27:21.713]  Maybe even David Rockefeller at 100 years old is somewhere shaking in the corner somewhere.
[02:27:23.274 --> 02:27:25.297]  But yeah, they're disgusting people.
[02:27:25.337 --> 02:27:33.166]  They don't have any relation to the real world, yet the decisions they make affect the entire planet.
[02:27:33.226 --> 02:27:41.597]  And Bilderberg Group and Davos member Peter Sutherland that heads up the UN program on migration, he admits he's opening the borders to quote, in the culture of Europe.
[02:27:42.017 --> 02:27:49.901]  Well, if they're going to do that, why not bring people in from, you know, like I said, Brazil or something that, you know, aren't wanting to put bags on women's heads and murder everyone.
[02:27:50.241 --> 02:27:52.262]  Why are they in a love affair with radical jihadists?
[02:27:53.697 --> 02:27:58.863]  You know, sometimes it doesn't even pay to try to psychoanalyze these people.
[02:27:59.444 --> 02:28:02.487]  They may just be, in fact, they may be insane.
[02:28:03.448 --> 02:28:13.500]  They often talk about the insanity of the Nazi regime in Germany, and if there was insanity there, why can't there be insanity with these people?
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:14.201]  Undoubtedly.
[02:28:14.321 --> 02:28:18.689]  I mean, why would Soros go on 60 Minutes and say, I'm not ashamed of being a Nazi collaborator?
[02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:20.713]  I mean, that's an exact quote.
[02:28:20.933 --> 02:28:21.875]  That's mental illness.
[02:28:22.196 --> 02:28:23.638]  Because he's not even ashamed of it.
[02:28:24.039 --> 02:28:25.922]  He should at least say he's ashamed, even if he isn't.
[02:28:26.636 --> 02:28:30.397]  Well, and Henry Kissinger saying power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.
[02:28:30.917 --> 02:28:34.138]  I mean, what normal person would say things like that?
[02:28:35.398 --> 02:28:38.359]  Yeah, these people are probably clinically insane.
[02:28:38.839 --> 02:28:40.459]  However, they've got a lot of influence.
[02:28:40.479 --> 02:28:41.419]  They've got a lot of money.
[02:28:41.439 --> 02:28:44.800]  And, you know, and the media's over there.
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:51.241]  You know, the media always sends their top, you know, their marquee reporters.
[02:28:51.421 --> 02:28:54.082]  And Leonardo DiCaprio, they're all fawning over him.
[02:28:55.131 --> 02:29:04.318]  Oh yeah, I mean, and anybody who's anybody over there, you know, Justin Trudeau, he's over there because he's recently been elected Prime Minister of Canada.
[02:29:04.659 --> 02:29:16.528]  This fascist in Argentina, Mauricio Macri, who's now like the generals during the dirty war of the 1970s, is starting to put his political opponents in jail.
[02:29:16.548 --> 02:29:21.552]  You know, Obama never congratulated many Latin American leaders
[02:29:22.012 --> 02:29:32.362]  Because a lot of them don't like Obama, but he sure couldn't wait to congratulate Macri the minute he was elected President of Argentina, a very close race back in November.
[02:29:33.083 --> 02:29:41.711]  So Obama, who used to basically monitor Latin American business activities for the CIA with his
[02:29:42.412 --> 02:29:49.714]  You know, you don't get these leopards to change their spots.
[02:29:50.134 --> 02:29:53.934]  Obama still likes to be dealing with these oligarchs.
[02:29:54.035 --> 02:29:54.435]  Stay there!
[02:29:54.455 --> 02:29:56.375]  I want to come right back and actually get into the articles.
[02:29:56.895 --> 02:29:58.676]  Global is covering up jihad violence.
[02:29:58.696 --> 02:29:59.616]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.096 --> 02:30:01.676]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.696 --> 02:30:05.297]  PrisonPlanet.com and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:09.893 --> 02:30:15.816]  In early January, the hermit nation of North Korea announced that it had successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb.
[02:30:16.036 --> 02:30:19.897]  This would make the fourth successful test that the isolated nation has claimed.
[02:30:20.237 --> 02:30:30.982]  Analysts at the time said this was Kim Jong-un in a display of saber-rattling to mark his birthday and to highlight a rare ruling party congress scheduled for May, the first gathering of its kind in 35 years.
[02:30:31.462 --> 02:30:33.823]  But just yesterday, Fox News reported that U.S.
[02:30:33.863 --> 02:30:35.784]  diplomats have stepped up pressure on China
[02:30:35.964 --> 02:30:36.404]  We're good to go.
[02:31:01.340 --> 02:31:04.051]  Stay tuned to InfoWars.com as more news breaks.

[02:31:13.035 --> 02:31:21.036]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:21.276 --> 02:31:26.298]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:33:03.426 --> 02:33:06.207]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:28.820 --> 02:33:30.141]  Ryan, Anthony, Kevin, Steve.
[02:33:30.201 --> 02:33:32.002]  We're going to take a few of your calls coming up.
[02:33:32.082 --> 02:33:35.244]  And Leanne McAdoo joins us from Flint, Michigan.
[02:33:36.245 --> 02:33:39.747]  And she says it is the most decrepit, broke-down place she's ever seen.
[02:33:39.767 --> 02:33:40.747]  Yeah, I've been up to Michigan.
[02:33:41.528 --> 02:33:46.251]  In the midst of that beautiful state, you then go into areas like Flint, and it looks like
[02:33:47.211 --> 02:33:50.532]  Post-apocalyptic World War II in Germany or something.
[02:33:51.012 --> 02:33:57.473]  There's a lot of beautiful architecture and stuff and it's just rotting and the people are black, white, I don't care, shuffling around like zombies.
[02:33:58.934 --> 02:33:59.734]  Just amazing.
[02:33:59.754 --> 02:34:01.614]  We're going to be talking to her as well.
[02:34:01.634 --> 02:34:03.235]  I want to get into the Islamic invasion.
[02:34:03.515 --> 02:34:07.936]  Everybody knows Wayne Madsen has never bashed Muslims, was against all the wars over there.
[02:34:08.056 --> 02:34:08.456]  Me too.
[02:34:09.096 --> 02:34:13.437]  You know, we got, you know, called, you know, you're aiding the radical Muslims because you don't want to blow up Iraq.
[02:34:13.477 --> 02:34:16.378]  No, we don't want to destabilize the whole region, which has now happened.
[02:34:16.738 --> 02:34:22.979]  Part of the clash of civilizations, which they're now going to enfold into Europe, the U.S., and take our freedoms as a response to the attacks.
[02:34:24.319 --> 02:34:27.840]  And we told you that 15 years ago, 16 years ago, from the PNAC document.
[02:34:28.100 --> 02:34:29.480]  They told us what they'd do.
[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:34.661]  So much of our job isn't hard, it's believing the globalists at their word.
[02:34:35.242 --> 02:34:37.082]  There's a plan, but they are insane.
[02:34:38.024 --> 02:34:40.165]  It's like Hitler's Barbarossa going into Russia.
[02:34:41.186 --> 02:34:42.067]  He's got a plan.
[02:34:42.087 --> 02:34:43.608]  He can get up at 5 a.m.
[02:34:43.628 --> 02:34:44.048]  in the morning.
[02:34:44.628 --> 02:34:46.310]  He can give orders all day, but he's crazy.
[02:34:47.911 --> 02:34:53.675]  In history, we just get these crazy people in charge, we take it as confidence, we take their orders, and then we wake up in hell.
[02:34:54.975 --> 02:35:01.420]  Before we go any further, though, folks supporting the broadcast make it possible so that next year, I was just thinking of this, I want to send Wayne Madsen
[02:35:02.796 --> 02:35:03.597]  To cover Davos.
[02:35:03.977 --> 02:35:12.784]  I'm not going to pay the $23,000 to get a ticket in, because you can cover that off C-SPAN or whatever, but the stuff around it, what's happening on the periphery, the whole deal.
[02:35:14.145 --> 02:35:15.226]  We've sent folks to Bilderberg.
[02:35:15.446 --> 02:35:17.728]  I'm going to send him next to Bilderberg as well.
[02:35:18.148 --> 02:35:19.009]  I go a lot as well.
[02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:20.430]  But it takes funding.
[02:35:20.810 --> 02:35:30.758]  So we sell super high quality products that are game changers because we want you to enjoy them and get a good response, and then buy more.
[02:35:31.098 --> 02:35:31.639]  It's a win-win.
[02:35:32.674 --> 02:35:34.716]  We have X2 Nation Iodine.
[02:35:35.196 --> 02:35:36.157]  Truly original.
[02:35:36.217 --> 02:35:37.398]  Truly proprietary.
[02:35:37.478 --> 02:35:38.278]  The good halogen.
[02:35:38.318 --> 02:35:40.840]  What it's done for my body and many others is just incredible.
[02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:41.561]  Read the reviews.
[02:35:41.921 --> 02:35:43.542]  Infowarslife.com.

[02:35:51.568 --> 02:35:53.450]  Super Female Vitality was sold out for two months.
[02:35:53.530 --> 02:35:54.050]  It's back.
[02:35:54.871 --> 02:35:57.293]  The new Super Male that came in is the strongest batch ever.
[02:35:58.340 --> 02:36:00.622]  Really tastes bad compared to the last batch.
[02:36:00.642 --> 02:36:01.262]  It's like wine.
[02:36:01.723 --> 02:36:07.287]  Concentrated herbs, known to get your glands operating properly, according to Dr. Gribbs' research.
[02:36:07.647 --> 02:36:11.330]  That is back as well at Infowarslife.com.

[02:36:22.628 --> 02:36:23.109]  We're good to go.
[02:36:37.708 --> 02:36:37.868]  Well,

[02:38:02.359 --> 02:38:02.399]  888-789-9277.
[02:38:02.419 --> 02:38:03.780]  Okay, I want to get to some calls.
[02:38:09.706 --> 02:38:12.677]  Leanne's coming up the last 15 minutes as well.
[02:38:12.778 --> 02:38:14.183]  Mads will ride shotgun with us.
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:19.222]  Wayne, obviously these are historic times we're now in.
[02:38:19.262 --> 02:38:21.044]  People are really paying attention now.
[02:38:21.524 --> 02:38:26.267]  But looking at the radical Islamist invasion, this is really getting people to pay attention.
[02:38:26.547 --> 02:38:28.329]  Let's get into your articles here.
[02:38:28.469 --> 02:38:38.295]  Report globalist cover-up, jihadist violence, European deals to cover it up, and then how that ties into ISIS-linked groups being protected by Obama in America.
[02:38:38.695 --> 02:38:39.396]  Unprecedented.
[02:38:40.506 --> 02:38:58.752]  Well, since the report about the cover-up in Europe, we have yet a later report out of Sweden that the Swedish police have been ordered to classify, as if it's national security information, all incidents involving migrants in Sweden.
[02:38:58.912 --> 02:39:04.754]  And that would be sexual assaults against women and any other petty crime.
[02:39:05.214 --> 02:39:07.095]  So this is a pattern.
[02:39:07.335 --> 02:39:07.875]  We saw it
[02:39:08.395 --> 02:39:35.087]  In Germany, first with the cover-up of the New Year's Eve rapes in Cologne, and then there were additional reports that these similar incidents took place around Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and we had Merkel who invited all these migrants in, of course with the encouragement of people like Soros, who said Europe can actually stand, you know, to have a few
[02:39:35.607 --> 02:39:45.033]  More million of these migrants, and couple that with the fact that we also had similar incidents with cover-up here.
[02:39:45.413 --> 02:39:57.081]  When the guy shot the Philly cop, the Muslim born in the United States, Archer, the new mayor of Philadelphia, Kenny, he says,
[02:39:57.561 --> 02:40:01.506]  Oh no, he's not tied up with any Islamic group.
[02:40:01.826 --> 02:40:12.698]  And then we find out that this guy had visited Saudi Arabia, he had been in Egypt, and even the Philadelphia Police Commissioner said he swore allegiance to the Islamic State.
[02:40:13.778 --> 02:40:17.840]  And we had the mayor, just like that mayor, that female mayor, Reker, in Cologne.
[02:40:17.940 --> 02:40:19.221]  She was covering up over there.
[02:40:19.261 --> 02:40:23.243]  It looks like mayors everywhere are reading from the same choir sheet.
[02:40:23.963 --> 02:40:27.945]  There was a Muslim attack on a nightclub in Calgary in Canada.
[02:40:28.285 --> 02:40:29.406]  Same situation.
[02:40:29.786 --> 02:40:31.327]  The local police covered it up.
[02:40:31.367 --> 02:40:33.107]  The Calgary authorities covered it up.
[02:40:33.468 --> 02:40:34.708]  So what's going on here?
[02:40:36.009 --> 02:40:37.590]  San Bernardino, they covered it up.
[02:40:38.670 --> 02:40:42.212]  Just to interrupt briefly, if you look at this, it's clear.
[02:40:42.692 --> 02:40:51.236]  The goals, and I want you to add to this because you always do, have points I don't bring up and angles I didn't think of, but bring them in, create a new political group you control.
[02:40:51.776 --> 02:40:55.978]  You can have them riot or burn things down like Paris or London whenever you want as a distraction.
[02:40:56.739 --> 02:40:58.839]  You can then ban speech that upsets them.
[02:40:59.940 --> 02:41:03.563]  You can declare civil emergencies, as France and Germany and others have done, to restrict free speech.
[02:41:03.983 --> 02:41:10.008]  You can beta test getting the police to cover up crimes under political correctness and corrupting them.
[02:41:10.949 --> 02:41:23.360]  And then on so many fronts, when people are finally sick of the radical Islamic invasion, you can point it at innocent Muslim countries that actually aren't part of it, like Iraq, aka after 9-11, and Saudi Arabia.
[02:41:24.542 --> 02:41:24.802]  Right.
[02:41:25.342 --> 02:41:34.386]  And now we find out that Facebook has agreed with the German government to censor all anti-migrant comments on Facebook.
[02:41:34.446 --> 02:41:38.648]  So, you know, that's going to happen here, too, eventually.
[02:41:39.949 --> 02:41:42.830]  Because, again, I think Trump hit
[02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:50.437]  The biggest issue is a sleeper issue, I believe, and that's Trump's opinion on political correctness.
[02:41:50.518 --> 02:41:56.143]  I mean, it has gotten way out of hand with the names of things and statues.
[02:41:56.183 --> 02:41:57.625]  People don't like them.
[02:41:57.645 --> 02:42:00.708]  Even stand-up comics are complaining today because
[02:42:04.352 --> 02:42:07.273]  They're going to infuriate somebody.
[02:42:07.393 --> 02:42:12.153]  They're going to make somebody upset with their comedy routines.
[02:42:12.193 --> 02:42:17.554]  And even Hillary complained about one comedy club somewhere.
[02:42:17.574 --> 02:42:18.614]  Absolutely.
[02:42:18.654 --> 02:42:21.375]  There is an attack on this across the board.
[02:42:21.735 --> 02:42:26.236]  I want to go to some phone calls on this subject and talk about the ISIS group in America as well.
[02:42:26.276 --> 02:42:28.036]  But first, your ISIS-connected groups.
[02:42:28.396 --> 02:42:32.317]  Let's go to Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zafir.
[02:42:33.537 --> 02:42:40.002]  Tells Christina Amanpour of CNN that while Saudi Arabia is panicking, the two countries can coexist in the region.
[02:42:40.283 --> 02:42:45.487]  And he points out, Saudi Arabia supposedly attacked you on 9-11, not us.
[02:42:45.987 --> 02:42:49.850]  So again, they're continuing to point out Saudi Arabia is backing ISIS.
[02:42:50.450 --> 02:42:54.173]  All of this, this is really some truth from Iran.
[02:42:54.213 --> 02:42:54.534]  Here it is.
[02:42:55.336 --> 02:42:57.457]  There was unsubstantiated charges.
[02:42:57.477 --> 02:43:02.580]  15 of the 19 people who blew up 9-11 were Saudi citizens.
[02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:09.144]  People who murdered others in San Bernardino had just visited Saudi Arabia.
[02:43:09.424 --> 02:43:10.685]  But I'm tired of this.
[02:43:10.705 --> 02:43:16.148]  But shouldn't Saudi Arabia be panicking that Iran is back in the Community of Nations?
[02:43:16.228 --> 02:43:18.610]  I think we were always in the Community of Nations.
[02:43:18.670 --> 02:43:22.132]  Now their allies have recognized that Iran is a serious partner.
[02:43:22.572 --> 02:43:29.294]  Up until then, it was the Saudi allies, particularly the United States, who was at loggerheads with Iran.
[02:43:29.354 --> 02:43:39.276]  Now, it hasn't changed, but the Saudis are panicking that there may be a slight opportunity that tensions between Iran and the West would reduce.
[02:43:39.616 --> 02:43:46.598]  And that smokescreen that had allowed them to export this Wahhabi ideology of extremism
[02:43:48.299 --> 02:43:55.004]  If that smoke screen disappears, then people will call Ace Payday safe.
[02:43:55.204 --> 02:43:56.545]  All of this is our talking point.
[02:43:56.565 --> 02:44:09.114]  I'm not bragging about Infowars and our guests, but we put Wahhabis on the map, we exposed Benghazi with our guests, Colonel Schaefer, countless others like Wayne Madsen, and now it's like Donald Trump, I know listens, is saying stuff he gets from the show.
[02:44:09.614 --> 02:44:18.460]  I mean this, and of course MSNBC admits the Republican leadership's getting talking points now from Infowars and trying to, and passing bills from the show on bullet purchasing.
[02:44:19.220 --> 02:44:26.565]  It's got to really upset the system now that people know the West is backing, and Saudi Arabia is backing ISIS, Wayne Madsen.
[02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:29.590]  Yeah, I just point one thing out about Amanpour.
[02:44:29.931 --> 02:44:31.011]  They sent her in there.
[02:44:31.131 --> 02:44:35.874]  She has a chip on her shoulder with Iran anyway because she's an Iranian Christian.
[02:44:36.195 --> 02:44:37.856]  Her family left Iran.
[02:44:38.236 --> 02:44:41.158]  So, I mean, so they send her in there with a chip on her shoulder.
[02:44:41.398 --> 02:44:42.439]  She wants some kind of argument.
[02:44:42.459 --> 02:44:43.399]  You looked at her face.
[02:44:43.479 --> 02:44:47.582]  I mean, to paraphrase Donald Trump, look at the face.
[02:44:47.862 --> 02:44:53.766]  I mean, she looks like she just took a whip of Limburger cheese when she was interviewing that Iranian foreign minister.
[02:44:54.693 --> 02:44:55.754]  Or smelled her upper lip.
[02:44:56.014 --> 02:44:58.755]  She helped sell the whole Serb genocide and made all that up.
[02:44:58.815 --> 02:45:00.836]  I mean, she's a real operative.
[02:45:00.876 --> 02:45:03.638]  You can tell, like Blitzer and all the rest of those people.
[02:45:03.698 --> 02:45:04.478]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:45:04.878 --> 02:45:07.320]  Yeah, that was a set-up interview.
[02:45:07.340 --> 02:45:12.823]  They could have sent anyone in there other than Amanpour to interview the foreign minister, but they chose not to.
[02:45:12.863 --> 02:45:17.305]  They wanted that to be a confrontational interview.
[02:45:17.605 --> 02:45:17.985]  That's right.
[02:45:18.025 --> 02:45:23.606]  We're going to get some calls now, then go to Leanne and come back to calls into the next hour a little bit.
[02:45:23.826 --> 02:45:27.167]  And I've got my info here on who's hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:45:27.187 --> 02:45:28.727]  We'll be getting to that in the next segment.
[02:45:29.248 --> 02:45:31.848]  But before I go any further, let's go to Anthony in Nevada.
[02:45:32.408 --> 02:45:33.749]  He's got an interesting point to raise.
[02:45:33.769 --> 02:45:34.049]  Go ahead.
[02:45:34.069 --> 02:45:35.609]  You're on the air with Alex Jones and Wayne Madsen.
[02:45:36.689 --> 02:45:36.929]  Yeah.
[02:45:37.029 --> 02:45:39.390]  Hi, Alex and Wayne.
[02:45:39.650 --> 02:45:43.931]  I noticed today on Facebook and I confirmed it with the Office of the Governor's
[02:45:45.703 --> 02:45:46.845]  I don't know.
[02:45:58.906 --> 02:46:01.327]  In the Liberty Movement, what do you think you're doing there?
[02:46:01.687 --> 02:46:04.107]  Well, yeah, this is a question I get a lot, okay?
[02:46:04.267 --> 02:46:06.928]  If I was invited to Davos, I would go.
[02:46:07.748 --> 02:46:11.189]  The Davos is a public Bilderberg meeting where they push their globalist agenda.
[02:46:11.589 --> 02:46:14.790]  But upwards of 10, 20, 30 percent of the people there are good folks.
[02:46:16.010 --> 02:46:19.471]  Texas is a boom town when the rest of the country is falling apart.
[02:46:19.751 --> 02:46:24.452]  Now with the oil situation and the fracking and things going bankrupt, that's not going to go too much longer.
[02:46:24.752 --> 02:46:28.173]  He's there literally, he goes on trade missions every couple of months trying to get jobs here.
[02:46:28.553 --> 02:46:30.876]  That's his main focus, is low taxes jobs.
[02:46:31.417 --> 02:46:37.965]  So, I expect to hear him come back and criticize their agenda, talk about it, try to stand up for Texas and America while he's there.
[02:46:38.285 --> 02:46:42.871]  He's pushing a con-con to try to, you know, stop what's going on in Congress.
[02:46:43.752 --> 02:46:45.174]  I know he's good by his actions.
[02:46:45.515 --> 02:46:49.099]  He can meet with the devil, and that's fine with me as long as he doesn't change his actions.
[02:46:49.640 --> 02:46:55.308]  I mean, I've gone and met with globalists before, I've gone and met with high-powered people in private, and it's a private meeting, I don't talk about it.
[02:46:55.488 --> 02:46:57.050]  Doesn't mean I ever accepted their offers.
[02:46:57.311 --> 02:46:58.773]  Wayne Madsen, do you agree with me or disagree?
[02:46:59.608 --> 02:47:06.811]  Well, I mean, I think that this is one of these forums where everybody has to meet some sort of, um, they're vetted somehow.
[02:47:06.971 --> 02:47:09.212]  So you're not, you're not going to get somebody.
[02:47:09.412 --> 02:47:14.654]  I don't think there is going to then go out and say, Oh, what a disgusting bunch of people.
[02:47:14.734 --> 02:47:18.616]  I mean, it's hard to criticize people when you're sitting with them at dinner.
[02:47:19.196 --> 02:47:25.200]  Drinking with them, socializing with them, and this is how they get their clutches into you.
[02:47:25.220 --> 02:47:25.961]  That's the answer.
[02:47:26.021 --> 02:47:27.161]  He's powerful.
[02:47:27.242 --> 02:47:32.545]  They're trying, just like they bring governors to Bilderberg, they're bringing him there probably to try to co-opt him.
[02:47:32.565 --> 02:47:43.612]  I'm sure they are because, you know, once you get a taste of that Sabruga caviar that sells for like $200 for an ounce, you know, you can be swayed very easily.
[02:47:43.632 --> 02:47:45.794]  All right, we'll continue to watch it.
[02:47:45.834 --> 02:47:47.035]  What do you think is going on, Anthony?
[02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:58.667]  Well, I'm sure he's there taking it all in and, you know, if he's a good reader of people, he's going to know when he's being lied to.
[02:47:59.148 --> 02:48:03.451]  But I'm just wondering if you think he might be in any danger?
[02:48:04.652 --> 02:48:08.034]  No, I mean, this isn't as cloak and dagger as Bilderberg.
[02:48:08.114 --> 02:48:10.576]  It's pretty much where they put out their globalist propaganda.
[02:48:11.016 --> 02:48:14.439]  So a lot of it's just stages and glitz and Hollywood and trade missions.
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:19.523]  The people there are sinister, the agenda is sinister, but this is where they soft sell it.
[02:48:19.824 --> 02:48:23.127]  It's not like he's meeting with Spectre in the middle of the desert, but it's a good point.
[02:48:23.827 --> 02:48:26.590]  In fact, I'd be surprised if he didn't go to things like Davos.
[02:48:28.731 --> 02:48:32.293]  But Wayne's right, they're bringing him there because he's a major up-and-comer.
[02:48:33.233 --> 02:48:42.038]  Now, let's go to, and you'll be riding shotgun with us, Leanne McAdoo from Flint, Michigan, filing amazing reports at InfoWars.com for the Nightly News.
[02:48:42.358 --> 02:48:52.544]  Leanne, continuing with the breakdown of what's happening there in Flint, I see it as emblematic of this rotting country and what NAFTA and GATT have done, and of corrupt government.
[02:48:53.064 --> 02:48:54.885]  And I think it's a scapegoat of the governor.
[02:48:54.905 --> 02:49:00.988]  And I'm not defending the governor either, but the local city and what's going on, they're just as culpable as the governor, in my view.
[02:49:01.028 --> 02:49:01.528]  What's your view?
[02:49:01.548 --> 02:49:02.409]  And then we'll get Wayne's view.
[02:49:03.349 --> 02:49:04.130]  Well, absolutely.
[02:49:04.190 --> 02:49:07.651]  That's kind of something that we're going to be talking about coming up in some upcoming videos.
[02:49:07.991 --> 02:49:11.513]  They keep kind of passing the buck, saying, well, no, it was this emergency manager.
[02:49:11.593 --> 02:49:13.234]  Well, no, it was this emergency manager.
[02:49:13.574 --> 02:49:14.054]  But it does.
[02:49:14.135 --> 02:49:19.817]  I mean, again and again and again, the red flags were there and they just kept passing the buck.
[02:49:19.857 --> 02:49:20.958]  The city voted against
[02:49:21.471 --> 02:49:29.036]  Uh, getting cut off from the Detroit water, then they wanted to get cut off, and so they're trying to figure out who to blame, but it's not about blaming one person.
[02:49:29.116 --> 02:49:32.578]  It's about fixing the problem, and it's so corrupt here.
[02:49:32.598 --> 02:49:36.060]  The government is so bloated and corrupt that nobody can fix anything.
[02:49:36.220 --> 02:49:37.981]  They all just want to run around pointing blame.
[02:49:39.242 --> 02:49:44.085]  And you're going to be talking to locals about the real number of deaths and more, but that's a good point, Wayne.
[02:49:44.125 --> 02:49:49.268]  In the final equation, why do you think Flint resembles, uh, Calcutta?
[02:49:50.307 --> 02:50:00.936]  Well, I think it's again, they killed every manufacturing job almost in this country with all this baloney, these baloney trade agreements.
[02:50:01.716 --> 02:50:07.121]  And I mean, NAFTA, it was supposed to open the border between the United States and Canada.
[02:50:07.501 --> 02:50:10.844]  I didn't need a passport before NAFTA to go back and forth to Canada.
[02:50:10.944 --> 02:50:11.865]  I need one now.
[02:50:12.386 --> 02:50:17.030]  And appointing emergency managers is so undemocratic.
[02:50:17.090 --> 02:50:18.572]  We saw it happen in Detroit.
[02:50:18.892 --> 02:50:27.360]  They tried to raffle off to the highest bidder all this Detroit Art Museum, these priceless collections just to make money for the city.
[02:50:28.140 --> 02:50:31.863]  It's good money after bad.
[02:50:31.903 --> 02:50:32.724]  Wayne, stay there.
[02:50:32.924 --> 02:50:35.466]  We're going to come back with Leanne for this segment and the next.
[02:50:35.826 --> 02:50:37.728]  And then we're going to pass the baton to David Knight.
[02:50:37.968 --> 02:50:40.010]  But Leanne, what else are you going to be covering when we return?
[02:50:41.223 --> 02:50:47.826]  Well, we are going to be talking with a local here coming up later, and he wants to take us right to the heart of it, right to these neighborhoods.
[02:50:47.866 --> 02:50:54.870]  That's where his dog actually died from the lead poisoning with the water, so we're getting into that as well.
[02:50:54.890 --> 02:50:55.310]  Wow.
[02:50:55.870 --> 02:50:56.331]  Amazing.
[02:50:56.391 --> 02:50:56.971]  Stay there.
[02:50:57.371 --> 02:50:59.772]  Leanne McAdoo reporting from Flint, Michigan.
[02:51:00.172 --> 02:51:03.034]  Pray for her and Michael Zimmerman that are in the middle of this.
[02:51:03.254 --> 02:51:05.115]  It is a real war zone.
[02:51:05.215 --> 02:51:05.935]  High crime.
[02:51:05.955 --> 02:51:06.916]  You name it.
[02:51:09.088 --> 02:51:13.711]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, a crashing economy.
[02:51:13.911 --> 02:51:14.791]  Are you ready?
[02:51:15.011 --> 02:51:17.673]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[02:51:17.773 --> 02:51:19.974]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[02:51:20.134 --> 02:51:23.636]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?
[02:51:23.937 --> 02:51:28.699]  Be wise and be ready with 25-Year Shelf Life Wise Food Storage.

[02:52:39.141 --> 02:52:39.922]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:52:39.942 --> 02:52:41.443]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:52:41.763 --> 02:52:43.044]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:52:43.404 --> 02:52:45.746]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:52:46.227 --> 02:52:48.088]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:52:48.528 --> 02:52:52.571]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:52:53.032 --> 02:52:56.735]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:52:56.975 --> 02:53:00.438]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:53:00.758 --> 02:53:01.058]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[02:53:01.078 --> 02:53:02.499]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:53:09.326 --> 02:53:10.708]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[02:53:11.148 --> 02:53:13.130]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[02:53:13.671 --> 02:53:17.315]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[02:53:17.555 --> 02:53:26.025]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[02:53:26.365 --> 02:53:29.649]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[02:53:30.510 --> 02:53:33.591]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[02:53:33.651 --> 02:53:38.253]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[02:53:39.013 --> 02:53:43.235]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[02:53:43.935 --> 02:53:46.756]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[02:53:47.116 --> 02:53:49.337]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[02:53:50.177 --> 02:53:56.442]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallets, sleeves, or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[02:53:57.202 --> 02:54:02.466]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model, you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[02:54:02.826 --> 02:54:04.548]  It is as though the protection is free.
[02:54:05.188 --> 02:54:06.829]  Visit idstronghold.com today.
[02:54:23.414 --> 02:54:27.695]  And again, if you just joined us, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:54:27.715 --> 02:54:29.095]  Fourth hour with David Knight coming up.
[02:54:29.135 --> 02:54:32.396]  I'm going to go a little bit to the next hour with Leigh-Anne and Wayne Madsen to take some of your calls.
[02:54:35.117 --> 02:54:38.457]  We're not here covering all these negative things to just say it's all over.
[02:54:38.497 --> 02:54:39.297]  The world's great.
[02:54:40.378 --> 02:54:41.558]  We have such innovation.
[02:54:41.618 --> 02:54:43.278]  Humanity can go to the stars together.
[02:54:43.698 --> 02:54:44.478]  Life extension.
[02:54:44.498 --> 02:54:45.559]  It's all within our grasp.
[02:54:45.959 --> 02:54:51.920]  The elite are producing a scientific dictatorship called the technocracy, in Davos' own words,
[02:54:52.892 --> 02:54:55.973]  With a planetary regime above the law.
[02:54:57.334 --> 02:54:58.734]  It's a 21st century threat.
[02:55:00.475 --> 02:55:01.655]  People now know about it.
[02:55:01.876 --> 02:55:03.056]  We forced it out in the open.
[02:55:03.136 --> 02:55:04.256]  You forced it out in the open.
[02:55:04.637 --> 02:55:06.097]  The battle is joined.
[02:55:06.537 --> 02:55:12.900]  I want to go to Howard and Steve, listening on KOMY, and John and a few others here in just a second.
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:15.981]  But Leanne, I know your reports are coming out.
[02:55:16.001 --> 02:55:17.262]  A lot of them are on Infowars.com.
[02:55:18.402 --> 02:55:23.423]  I know you're going to talk to locals and point out, hey, they add fluoride and all this other stuff in the water afterwards.
[02:55:24.103 --> 02:55:28.104]  I mean, it's, you know, kind of an oxymoron to complain about the lead, but then look at this.
[02:55:28.124 --> 02:55:30.725]  But I mean, it is crazy that they knew people were dying.
[02:55:30.745 --> 02:55:35.086]  And I mean, people should go to prison for this, Leanne.
[02:55:35.426 --> 02:55:36.727]  Where do you think all this is going?
[02:55:37.907 --> 02:55:39.847]  Well, I mean, that's the thing that's just so frightening.
[02:55:39.927 --> 02:55:45.749]  I've talked to some people here and they say they don't want this to get politicized because that's going to just congest the
[02:55:46.627 --> 02:55:48.309]  It should congest the whole thing even further.
[02:55:48.329 --> 02:55:50.091]  I mean, just dig up the lead pipes.
[02:55:50.511 --> 02:55:53.474]  And so that's sort of the gridlock that we're seeing here with this.
[02:55:53.815 --> 02:56:04.386]  But I mean, as these emails come out, as the people are beginning to see just how deep this cover-up went, and just the neglect, and just people passing the buck saying, no, don't tell anyone.
[02:56:04.766 --> 02:56:09.251]  I mean, we have emails from mothers who were taking their children into the doctor
[02:56:09.753 --> 02:56:23.885]  Uh, saying, you know, they're getting these rashes, and taking these blood samples, and then the doctors, I guess, they would get some orders from high up, that would say, no, don't take those samples, we can't trust those, I mean, it's just... Well, Leanne, there's your headline!
[02:56:23.905 --> 02:56:27.248]  I mean, if you've got that, do a report, just talk about the reports you're getting.
[02:56:27.548 --> 02:56:32.092]  Mothers, mothers, doctors told, doctors covered up sick babies in Flint.
[02:56:32.312 --> 02:56:33.253]  I mean, that is incredible.
[02:56:33.513 --> 02:56:37.376]  See how this culture of cover-up just rolls downhill, Wayne Madsen?
[02:56:38.237 --> 02:56:53.741]  Yeah, and it doesn't surprise me because, you know, as I was saying, the first casualty of appointing emergency managers for cities is that the emergency manager comes in and tells the mayor, I'm in charge, and the mayor says, well, where are you from?
[02:56:53.761 --> 02:56:57.482]  Well, the emergency managers usually aren't even from that town.
[02:56:57.622 --> 02:56:58.582]  They're FEMA minions.
[02:56:59.202 --> 02:57:02.964]  They're from another state in some case, like the one they gave to Detroit.
[02:57:03.284 --> 02:57:22.175]  And so the mayor is shunted aside, the city council has no say, the emergency manager takes his orders from the governor, in this case Snyder in Lansing, and it looks like maybe some of Snyder's friends in the healthcare industry
[02:57:22.835 --> 02:57:26.838]  Which is one of the major contributors, by the way, to his campaign.
[02:57:26.878 --> 02:57:28.339]  Oh, made money off the sick.
[02:57:28.899 --> 02:57:29.279]  Yeah.
[02:57:29.299 --> 02:57:30.220]  An insurance scam.
[02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:31.961]  Well, if that's the case, he needs to be indicted.
[02:57:32.721 --> 02:57:43.067]  Right, and we don't want to hear anything about no sick babies because that's going to run our health, our costs up because this is, you know, these are HMOs, these are privatized hospitals.
[02:57:43.087 --> 02:57:44.508]  So you just taught me something.
[02:57:44.588 --> 02:57:51.853]  I'm saying it's true the county and city should have handled it, but if they were under an emergency decree, that is the governor's fault, and he should go to jail for these emails.
[02:57:52.293 --> 02:57:58.316]  He should, and it took President Obama a long time to even respond to the Flint situation.
[02:57:59.497 --> 02:58:02.338]  Although he can say it wasn't the feds, it was the state.
[02:58:02.839 --> 02:58:04.220]  Where was he earlier?
[02:58:04.300 --> 02:58:07.621]  I mean, shares getting bottles of water sent in from Iceland.
[02:58:07.942 --> 02:58:08.402]  Incredible.
[02:58:08.422 --> 02:58:12.664]  Leanne, we're going to break in one minute with you and Wayne to take a few calls, but is that not unprecedented?
[02:58:12.684 --> 02:58:15.486]  What he just pointed out, that the governor was over this.
[02:58:15.806 --> 02:58:18.347]  I didn't realize that reading 50 news articles on this.
[02:58:18.587 --> 02:58:19.608]  They obscured all that.
[02:58:19.828 --> 02:58:21.449]  So he's passing the buck too, Leanne.
[02:58:22.202 --> 02:58:23.663]  Yeah, absolutely, and that's the thing.
[02:58:23.683 --> 02:58:28.384]  The people voted, and the emergency manager just comes in and says, we don't care about your vote.
[02:58:28.484 --> 02:58:29.765]  This is what we're going to do here.
[02:58:29.825 --> 02:58:30.845]  So it's just very frightening.
[02:58:31.025 --> 02:58:34.787]  Wow, so state dictatorship forced poison water on Flint.
[02:58:35.547 --> 02:58:36.327]  I didn't understand that.
[02:58:36.347 --> 02:58:39.729]  When I'm wrong, which isn't a lot, but I'm wrong sometimes, I'll admit it, wow, I didn't understand that.
[02:58:40.049 --> 02:58:40.829]  This is even worse.
[02:58:40.869 --> 02:58:42.170]  Thank you, Wayne, for pointing that out.

[03:00:02.173 --> 03:00:06.836]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:10.719 --> 03:00:13.661]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[03:00:13.741 --> 03:00:16.724]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[03:00:16.824 --> 03:00:18.405]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[03:00:18.905 --> 03:00:21.307]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[03:00:22.047 --> 03:00:24.929]  Somewhere along the way.
[03:00:24.969 --> 03:00:28.012]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.172 --> 03:00:31.154]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[03:00:32.368 --> 03:00:35.251]  Oh, there's a judge up there.
[03:00:35.291 --> 03:00:36.352]  I can feel the Providence.
[03:00:39.354 --> 03:00:40.515]  Amarillo's where I'll be.
[03:00:40.635 --> 03:00:45.219]  I'm going a little bit in the next segment with David Knight, and I'm gonna tell you what's coming up.
[03:00:45.319 --> 03:00:46.520]  I'm gonna try to get to more of your calls.
[03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:48.902]  David will get to the rest here in the fourth hour.
[03:00:48.922 --> 03:00:50.403]  I'd love to do the fourth hour, but I've got...
[03:00:51.284 --> 03:00:53.005]  Miles to go before I sleep.
[03:00:53.185 --> 03:00:59.229]  To quote that famous poem, the woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I've got miles to go before I sleep.
[03:00:59.710 --> 03:01:03.953]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in New York, because you bring up sleeper cells in the U.S.
[03:01:04.253 --> 03:01:05.233]  We know they're here.
[03:01:06.054 --> 03:01:13.679]  That's a false flag in and of itself, because they let the radical Islamists in, let them attack, and then they don't get in trouble who brought them in.
[03:01:14.179 --> 03:01:15.400]  Go ahead, John, from New York.
[03:01:17.101 --> 03:01:17.582]  Yes, guys.
[03:01:18.777 --> 03:01:24.421]  I used to work for a major television network on the west side of Manhattan.
[03:01:25.562 --> 03:01:26.282]  I'm eating lunch.
[03:01:26.883 --> 03:01:36.049]  In that building was a famous hard-hitting news investigation thing that shows up on Sunday nights, uses a stopwatch.
[03:01:37.029 --> 03:01:38.050]  Sixty minutes.
[03:01:39.471 --> 03:01:39.711]  Yes.
[03:01:40.872 --> 03:01:47.497]  About General Alexander Lebed and the disappeared 25 suitcase nukes?
[03:01:49.284 --> 03:01:50.605]  Yes, that's part of it.
[03:01:50.865 --> 03:02:08.676]  But before that happened, what made that story happen was that a story came in and was covered by CBS News that a call came in that a nuclear suitcase bomb was found in a garage in Lower Manhattan.
[03:02:09.696 --> 03:02:12.638]  Now, I was at home when the story came on.
[03:02:13.573 --> 03:02:17.718]  Watching television, I had a TV tray with some food on it.
[03:02:17.798 --> 03:02:23.064]  When that story came on, the tray went one way and the food went the other way, trying to record it.
[03:02:23.284 --> 03:02:25.547]  I couldn't do it, so I figured I'd be at work the next day.
[03:02:25.607 --> 03:02:31.213]  I'd go down to the newsroom and try to get a three-quarter-inch pneumatic copy of the tape.
[03:02:31.233 --> 03:02:32.615]  And let me guess, they wouldn't give it to you?
[03:02:33.928 --> 03:02:34.870]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:02:49.716 --> 03:02:54.178]  Then, years later, the video service, it was on CNN and Fox, and that they jumped the gun.
[03:02:54.278 --> 03:03:01.981]  Reuters had given them a report saying they had basically jumped in the race before the starting pistol fired.
[03:03:02.241 --> 03:03:02.981]  That's amazing.
[03:03:03.001 --> 03:03:10.084]  I'm going to have Wayne and Leanne finish up in the next segment, and then Leanne's going to tell us some of the other reports she's got coming up from Flint.
[03:03:10.104 --> 03:03:16.027]  But, Wayne, I mean, it is that type of memory hole stuff where you see it, and then they won't give you a copy of it.
[03:03:16.067 --> 03:03:17.047]  That's what's really spooky.
[03:03:17.935 --> 03:03:30.986]  Yeah, what I've noticed with a lot of breaking stories is they always say, oh no, the initial information is wrong and it's later that we get the correct information.
[03:03:31.006 --> 03:03:32.367]  I don't believe that to be true.
[03:03:32.387 --> 03:03:34.589]  I believe that the initial reports
[03:03:35.129 --> 03:03:35.469]  Sure.
[03:03:35.489 --> 03:03:40.552]  Sure, sure, but I mean, with Building 7, they said it fell before it fell, and then it did.
[03:03:40.612 --> 03:03:42.933]  I mean, we really caught them.
[03:03:56.360 --> 03:03:56.900]  Exactly.
[03:03:57.020 --> 03:04:01.781]  And, you know, the same thing with the 1993 Trade Center bombing.
[03:04:02.141 --> 03:04:07.202]  They came out with initial reports and later we were told, no, they weren't correct either.
[03:04:07.282 --> 03:04:15.563]  So, I mean, this whole situation with the news media, as the caller from New York is suggesting, they do manipulate the news.
[03:04:15.603 --> 03:04:23.685]  They've been manipulating the news at least since the end of World War II with the CIA's program called the Mighty Wurlitzer.
[03:04:24.045 --> 03:04:29.467]  Well, we're gonna try and get some really great drone footage just here in this town and just to let people get a bird's-eye view of
[03:04:48.297 --> 03:04:54.521]  How beautiful this architecture was, it is, from this city and then you go and you see how dilapidated it all is.
[03:04:54.642 --> 03:04:56.443]  Drone shows devastated Flint?
[03:04:57.464 --> 03:04:57.784]  Oh yes.
[03:04:58.344 --> 03:05:06.950]  So it's going to be a really good view there and obviously we're going to be speaking with some locals, trying to get a personal account from people who have actually been in the most devastating... Amazing!
[03:05:06.990 --> 03:05:07.811]  Stay there, Leanne!
[03:05:09.741 --> 03:05:16.585]  The Democratic Party establishment that wants to install Hillary into the White House in this next election season is currently in free fall.
[03:05:16.765 --> 03:05:24.810]  The plan for potential first husband Bill Clinton has failed miserably, as women have crawled out of the woodwork to describe his detailed history of sexual abuse.
[03:05:25.110 --> 03:05:30.813]  She also has the looming email scandal, which doesn't seem to go away, no matter how many jokes she throws at it.
[03:05:30.933 --> 03:05:32.474]  The latest news comes out of Beaumont.
[03:05:32.534 --> 03:05:35.557]  Where only six people were at the airport to greet the former first lady.
[03:05:35.698 --> 03:05:39.342]  KDFM reported that she didn't say hello or visit any of those six people.
[03:05:39.442 --> 03:05:40.523]  She just drove away.
[03:05:40.703 --> 03:05:41.544]  And where was she going?
[03:05:41.804 --> 03:05:46.069]  Oh, to a private fundraiser held by Pakistani businessman Tahir Javid to collect $500,000.
[03:05:46.289 --> 03:05:49.373]  The news reported it as a private meeting.
[03:05:49.613 --> 03:05:53.117]  Back in 2008, she attended another private meeting with Barack Obama.
[03:05:53.257 --> 03:05:56.940]  This occurred, of course, in Chantilly, Virginia, during the Bilderberg meeting.
[03:05:57.140 --> 03:06:02.164]  In fact, her campaign has become so desperate, she's now labeling Bernie Sanders as a white elitist.
[03:06:02.384 --> 03:06:04.045]  Read the article at InfoWars.com.
[03:06:04.166 --> 03:06:05.887]  Bernie Sanders, very white.
[03:06:06.027 --> 03:06:09.189]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.

[03:08:06.960 --> 03:08:13.224]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:13.784 --> 03:08:16.566]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:20.558 --> 03:08:25.300]  I love how Hillary lands in Texas and only has six idiot supporters waiting for her.
[03:08:25.320 --> 03:08:30.441]  And I love the gimmick of, oh, she's a woman, so they have these articles in the Washington Post.
[03:08:30.962 --> 03:08:33.322]  All the women in the press are supporting her because she's a woman.
[03:08:35.803 --> 03:08:37.784]  It's just weird identity politics.
[03:08:37.804 --> 03:08:40.105]  I mean, I wouldn't vote for somebody because they're a man or a woman.
[03:08:41.400 --> 03:08:49.523]  It's like the left claims they're so unbigoted, and they're the most bigoted, small-minded, gang mentality group of idiots I've ever seen.
[03:08:50.283 --> 03:08:52.504]  And again, because they're not the left, I am a liberal.
[03:08:52.884 --> 03:08:54.344]  Thomas Jefferson style, baby.
[03:08:55.265 --> 03:08:56.065]  You want to study history?
[03:08:56.745 --> 03:09:00.426]  In classical sense, Jefferson was a liberal, Washington was a conservative.
[03:09:00.787 --> 03:09:01.867]  I'm in between those two guys.
[03:09:03.183 --> 03:09:05.584]  Because I've read their debates between each other, the first and third president.
[03:09:05.984 --> 03:09:14.488]  Wayne, I want to, Leanne, I had her go because the light's dropping, they're going to launch a drone, they've got a bunch of interviews, and so the intrepid reporter, she wanted to get out there and get to work.
[03:09:14.908 --> 03:09:27.433]  But on what I just said, the labels, I mean obviously the neocons are horrible, we opposed them, but now the Democrats, am I wrong in saying it's like watching cancer metastasize, and in Europe too?
[03:09:27.913 --> 03:09:32.475]  Isn't the establishment using the left to make its biggest advancements ever for tyranny?
[03:09:33.703 --> 03:09:41.148]  Well, I've noticed on the web the debate between the Hillary supporters and the supporters of Bernie Sanders.
[03:09:41.649 --> 03:09:52.857]  And I gotta say that there appears to be this regimented attempt to force the Hillary people into some sort of groupthink.
[03:09:53.837 --> 03:10:03.304]  That they all are preaching off the same talking point memo received from the Clinton campaign headquarters up in Brooklyn in New York.
[03:10:04.004 --> 03:10:15.810]  And, you know, whether you agree with Sanders or not, his supporters are really being torn apart by the Hillary Clinton supporters.
[03:10:15.830 --> 03:10:22.374]  They're accusing them of being, you know, white elitists, as Sanders is.
[03:10:22.834 --> 03:10:24.855]  You know, they're trying to make this a race issue.
[03:10:24.935 --> 03:10:26.255]  Oh yeah, I didn't even cover that today.
[03:10:26.275 --> 03:10:27.355]  That's why I love having you on.
[03:10:27.675 --> 03:10:37.178]  I've got two articles here in the stack where they go, Sanders is too white, and you're white, and you're racist, and you're sexist, when the guy is the most flaming liberal in the galaxy.
[03:10:37.498 --> 03:10:41.819]  It just shows they are nakedly using sex and race baiting to divide and conquer.
[03:10:42.622 --> 03:10:50.484]  Yeah, you can say a lot of things about Bernie Sanders, but I mean, he was involved in the Civil Rights Movement back in the 60s.
[03:10:51.224 --> 03:10:51.964]  He's anything.
[03:10:52.024 --> 03:11:00.906]  I mean, the guy was elected as a socialist candidate for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, which some people call the People's Republic of Burlington.
[03:11:00.926 --> 03:11:08.788]  Yeah, what does that tell the leftists that support him, many of them, you know, are well-meaning people, that the Democratic Party would use political correctness on them?
[03:11:09.088 --> 03:11:10.168]  That ought to be a wake-up call.
[03:11:10.968 --> 03:11:21.952]  Yeah, and you had Joe Biden, by the way, almost sounding like Joe McCarthy saying, well, you know, we know that Bernie Sanders is a card-carrying socialist.
[03:11:22.032 --> 03:11:38.798]  Like, wow, you know, is that sort of like McCarthy saying, I got here in my hand a list of 57 known communists in the State Department, when in fact he was speaking at a banquet and he noticed he got the number from a bottle of Heinz 57 steak sauce sitting on the banquet table.
[03:11:39.551 --> 03:11:44.113]  Well, the truth is, we know the big robber barons were funding Stalin and Mao and all of them the whole time.
[03:11:44.153 --> 03:11:47.934]  I mean, it's fascism coupled with socialism and communism to control.
[03:11:48.014 --> 03:11:49.535]  It's really all crony capitalism.
[03:11:50.035 --> 03:11:52.456]  Until we wake up to that dichotomy, it's game over.
[03:11:52.736 --> 03:11:56.477]  We've got loaded phones with Steve and Howard and Ryan and Ronnie and everybody and Kevin.
[03:11:56.817 --> 03:11:58.698]  I'm sure they're going to want to end up talking to David Knight.
[03:11:58.858 --> 03:12:00.258]  I've got to punch out of here.
[03:12:00.698 --> 03:12:01.699]  Got to as many as I could.
[03:12:01.779 --> 03:12:03.439]  Great job, Wayne Madsen.
[03:12:03.479 --> 03:12:04.580]  Thank you so much for all you do.
[03:12:05.148 --> 03:12:06.068]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[03:12:25.794 --> 03:12:27.315]  Trying to develop budgets and stuff.
[03:12:27.335 --> 03:12:32.239]  I don't want to put them on five flights to get, you know, on a direct flight would be quicker, but then it turns into a money issue.
[03:12:33.220 --> 03:12:35.642]  But we're really, I mean, running a news operation ain't easy.
[03:12:35.662 --> 03:12:36.343]  I got to be on air.
[03:12:36.383 --> 03:12:36.943]  I'm not complaining.
[03:12:37.003 --> 03:12:38.324]  I'm just saying I got to be on air.
[03:12:38.364 --> 03:12:39.265]  I got to oversee things.
[03:12:39.285 --> 03:12:40.226]  I got to edit some things.
[03:12:40.266 --> 03:12:41.567]  I got to double check things.
[03:12:41.587 --> 03:12:42.507]  I got to come up with the money.
[03:12:42.547 --> 03:12:43.628]  I got to work with the sponsors.
[03:12:43.668 --> 03:12:45.310]  I got to make sure we have the products.
[03:12:45.350 --> 03:12:48.312]  I've got to make sure they're all certified and been double, triple tested.
[03:12:48.652 --> 03:12:50.074]  I've got to deal with the, with the,
[03:12:50.774 --> 03:12:54.156]  Gremlins, I mean, literal COINTELPRO stuff on a weekly basis.
[03:12:54.797 --> 03:12:56.698]  Just realize we're fighting as hard as we can.
[03:12:57.059 --> 03:12:58.179]  Sometimes I fall down.
[03:12:58.259 --> 03:12:59.240]  Sometimes I act mad.
[03:12:59.560 --> 03:13:00.881]  Sometimes I don't do the best job.
[03:13:00.921 --> 03:13:02.122]  Sometimes I miss a story.
[03:13:02.943 --> 03:13:06.665]  Sometimes, you know, because it's real, folks.
[03:13:07.246 --> 03:13:08.647]  I mean, we're not magic here.
[03:13:09.727 --> 03:13:10.788]  And I know you know that.
[03:13:10.848 --> 03:13:14.950]  I just want you to know we're dedicated in doing as much as we can.
[03:13:15.750 --> 03:13:19.792]  And that's why I want to just encourage you to realize this is a special operation that you helped build.
[03:13:20.312 --> 03:13:22.633]  Please spread the word to everybody you know.
[03:13:22.954 --> 03:13:31.218]  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, your own website, call in the talk radio, access TV, whatever the case is, our articles, our videos, our material, our info.
[03:13:31.538 --> 03:13:32.358]  It's powerful.
[03:13:32.798 --> 03:13:33.839]  It's waking people up.
[03:13:33.919 --> 03:13:35.620]  It's shattering controlled paradigms.
[03:13:35.980 --> 03:13:37.401]  It's transcending the mold.
[03:13:38.041 --> 03:13:43.584]  It's really having a big effect in search of renaissance, Americana and true liberty in our time.
[03:13:44.585 --> 03:13:49.287]  And I just want to ask you out there to really take the challenge.
[03:13:49.647 --> 03:13:50.228]  Believe me.
[03:13:51.320 --> 03:13:54.401]  And go to Infowarslife.com and try some X2 for a month.
[03:13:54.821 --> 03:13:56.842]  Try some Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[03:13:57.202 --> 03:14:02.404]  Try some Deep Cleanse, which has the Shilajit and the Zeolites for detoxing.
[03:14:02.884 --> 03:14:04.285]  Absolutely blowing folks away.
[03:14:04.385 --> 03:14:05.545]  Try the Oxy Powder.
[03:14:06.425 --> 03:14:07.546]  Try the Brain Force.
[03:14:07.586 --> 03:14:08.726]  Talk about instant results.
[03:14:09.667 --> 03:14:11.387]  Try the products.
[03:14:12.007 --> 03:14:14.248]  And regardless, you know you're funding the operation.
[03:14:14.288 --> 03:14:18.290]  But if you'll try them, you'll experience just how good and
[03:14:19.270 --> 03:14:24.116]  Again, cutting-edge, game-changing, leading-edge, whatever term you want to use, these products are.
[03:14:24.497 --> 03:14:26.679]  DNA Force, a true nutraceutical.
[03:14:27.120 --> 03:14:28.301]  Bio PQQ.
[03:14:29.847 --> 03:14:35.311]  True Organic CoQ10 at levels off the charts compared to what leading competitors are.
[03:14:35.651 --> 03:14:41.395]  People normally sell something like this for $300 to $600, folks, because they have seven-time markup on it.
[03:14:41.495 --> 03:14:42.595]  Ours is only one time.
[03:14:43.076 --> 03:14:58.326]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139, and you're helping fund sending Leanne McAdoo to Flint, sending Wayne Madsen out to the CIA base in Arizona,
[03:14:58.886 --> 03:14:59.647]  Thanks for having us.
[03:15:16.977 --> 03:15:18.278]  Hillary in San Antonio.
[03:15:18.799 --> 03:15:20.761]  Hillary lands, only has a few supporters.
[03:15:21.221 --> 03:15:22.963]  Driverless cars, government funded.
[03:15:23.404 --> 03:15:27.088]  California's having to wait 18 months to get an appointment to apply for concealed carry.
[03:15:27.488 --> 03:15:29.430]  How they killed the second amendment with bureaucracy.
[03:15:29.851 --> 03:15:31.953]  Davos, elite freak out about Trump.
[03:15:32.313 --> 03:15:35.617]  It's all coming up right now with David Knight.
[03:15:35.877 --> 03:15:37.819]  I'm Alex Jones signing off from the War Room.
[03:15:38.119 --> 03:15:39.361]  He's in the Situation Room.
[03:15:39.963 --> 03:15:54.733]  Thank you, Alex, and I want to talk about what's going on in the bigger picture here with Davos, because we're seeing a lot of information coming out of that as this one article that's up on the Drudge Report about the specter of Donald Trump haunting Davos.
[03:15:55.774 --> 03:15:58.115]  I would say the people there are Spectre.
[03:15:58.555 --> 03:16:00.796]  These are the James Bond villains.
[03:16:01.076 --> 03:16:02.537]  There's not a Spectre of Donald Trump.
[03:16:02.837 --> 03:16:03.757]  It is Spectre.
[03:16:03.857 --> 03:16:17.643]  And that is an interesting thing because I think they're looking at this, they're concerned about how every day we see more information about how they expect to have AI robots take over their factories, they're going to run their businesses for them.
[03:16:17.723 --> 03:16:22.705]  They're concerned because how are they going to manage the slaves, the human slaves, us?
[03:16:22.905 --> 03:16:24.506]  Because you don't understand that a robot
[03:16:25.106 --> 03:16:27.871]  Really comes from, I think it was a Czech word for slave.
[03:16:27.891 --> 03:16:30.496]  That's what they derive that from.
[03:16:30.556 --> 03:16:34.223]  So they're looking for mechanical slaves to replace the human slaves.
[03:16:34.864 --> 03:16:36.568]  You know, when you look at Brave New World...
[03:16:37.557 --> 03:16:46.525]  Huxley was talking about deliberately dumbing down humans so that you would have a mass-produced group of humans that they could use as slaves.
[03:16:47.426 --> 03:16:55.333]  Perhaps you could draw some analogies, and we have in the past, many times, with what's going on with fluoride, the chemicals that they put in the water to try to take away IQ points.
[03:16:55.373 --> 03:17:01.338]  We see this happening very quickly in Flint, Michigan, with what they've done there.
[03:17:02.099 --> 03:17:16.709]  When you look at these programs, why isn't it a criminal offense to make people pay for dumping toxic stuff that's going to lower your IQ, going to have tremendous adverse effects on your health?
[03:17:17.209 --> 03:17:17.709]  Fluoride.
[03:17:18.190 --> 03:17:19.371]  Dumping that in the water.
[03:17:19.411 --> 03:17:26.295]  We know from Harvard studies, from Chinese studies, that you get 20 points off of the IQ of children when you put this in.
[03:17:26.335 --> 03:17:31.819]  You have no way of controlling the dosage when you dump medication into the water.
[03:17:32.739 --> 03:17:34.400]  But we've got those types of issues.
[03:17:34.420 --> 03:17:46.423]  But getting back to DeVos, okay, they're looking at this and they're saying, well, one guy says, I think the nominees will be Trump for the Republicans, Hillary for the Democrats, the next year will be very uncertain, a chaotic period.
[03:17:47.023 --> 03:17:48.484]  And of course, they are worried about that.
[03:17:48.864 --> 03:17:51.725]  They're worried about Trump, because they don't control Trump.
[03:17:51.785 --> 03:17:55.206]  That doesn't mean, understand, that he's necessarily going to help us, okay?
[03:17:55.926 --> 03:18:04.857]  It's just that they don't control him, and I think we have to be very careful that we don't make that kind of connection that just because, you know, they don't like him, he's a good guy.
[03:18:04.897 --> 03:18:14.869]  Nevertheless, when you look at what they're most concerned about, the things like trade and open borders, yeah, he is against them, definitely against them, and with us.
[03:18:15.430 --> 03:18:27.033]  They said the prospect of a Trump White House is ratcheting up anxiety amongst the 2,500 business and political leaders gathered in the Swiss ski resort for the annual World Economic Forum.
[03:18:27.053 --> 03:18:29.014]  They usually talk about it as the WEF.
[03:18:29.074 --> 03:18:34.435]  I look at it and I say the WTF because that's when I look at this, it's like, what is going on?
[03:18:34.495 --> 03:18:39.277]  This is openly plotting against us, just as we've seen in the last week.
[03:18:40.057 --> 03:18:50.089]  We see another example, not just these trade treaties like Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic Partnership, where they openly write the regulations, they tell the lawmakers that we elect to shut up, you can't see this, you can't talk about it.
[03:18:51.250 --> 03:18:54.994]  They're openly writing the regulations for driverless cars.
[03:18:55.655 --> 03:19:13.183]  And the other issue of this, which I think pulls this together, is with all this talk about robots, all this talk about driverless cars, one of the things that's on the horizon besides greasing the skids for Google and the others who went to Washington, they went to the Obama administration, the Department of Transportation, said, look,
[03:19:13.939 --> 03:19:17.521]  We've had a pretty bad record, and it's come out with safety in California.
[03:19:17.561 --> 03:19:25.964]  So the California Department of Transportation is about to mandate some rules to make sure that we have a human capable of taking over control of the car.
[03:19:25.984 --> 03:19:26.744]  We don't want that.
[03:19:27.245 --> 03:19:27.725]  We don't want that.
[03:19:27.745 --> 03:19:32.407]  We want to accelerate the driverless cars, not have them operate under safety.
[03:19:32.427 --> 03:19:35.708]  But of course, they sell it to you as a safety device.
[03:19:36.369 --> 03:19:37.329]  That's not what it's about.
[03:19:37.849 --> 03:19:39.530]  So the Obama administration says, fine.
[03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:40.530]  Tell you what we'll do.
[03:19:40.730 --> 03:19:47.933]  We'll give massive subsidies to Silicon Valley companies to develop this, and we'll give them flexible regulations.
[03:19:47.973 --> 03:19:54.575]  In other words, we will shut down any safety regulations, any safety concerns at the state and local level, and we'll grease the skids for you.
[03:19:54.615 --> 03:20:03.477]  Meanwhile, for Americans, we will mandate something that we're going to talk about briefly here, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure.
[03:20:03.497 --> 03:20:04.598]  We haven't really talked about that.
[03:20:04.778 --> 03:20:07.639]  That's one of the ways you're going to control the slaves when we get angry.
[03:20:08.119 --> 03:20:08.699]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:09.798 --> 03:20:12.980]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?
[03:20:13.380 --> 03:20:15.181]  How would you like to never be cold again?

[03:25:31.054 --> 03:25:34.215]  And also, we have Super Female Vitality back in stock.
[03:25:34.876 --> 03:25:40.479]  Those are excellent things to have, especially things like nascent iodine and silver.
[03:25:40.539 --> 03:25:45.141]  You have those available as a, really as a prepper backup.
[03:25:45.161 --> 03:25:49.323]  It's something that's not going to go bad, and there's a lot of different uses for those products.
[03:25:49.464 --> 03:25:50.124]  Very essential.
[03:25:50.844 --> 03:25:52.145]  Uh, to have that in your stock.
[03:25:52.605 --> 03:25:53.905]  As well as food.
[03:25:53.965 --> 03:25:57.106]  As we're pointing out this story about Snowmageddon 2016.
[03:25:57.366 --> 03:26:02.007]  They're saying this winter storm, they're already feeling the effects of this in Washington, D.C.
[03:26:02.047 --> 03:26:08.189]  I saw where, I think it was a 20 minute ride that Barack Obama would take.
[03:26:08.449 --> 03:26:09.770]  It took him one or two hours.
[03:26:09.850 --> 03:26:11.030]  I'm going by memory here.
[03:26:11.390 --> 03:26:12.550]  But they got stuck in this snowstorm.
[03:26:12.590 --> 03:26:14.511]  They say they expect 50 to 60 mile an hour.
[03:26:15.071 --> 03:26:16.292]  We're good to go.
[03:26:32.867 --> 03:26:45.862]  lived in North Carolina and one year we went up to, it was up to Buffalo, New York and we got there just before Thanksgiving and it was the most snow they'd had in a short period of time now.
[03:26:46.562 --> 03:26:50.567]  They'd had a record snowstorm with more total snow but this happened so quickly.
[03:26:51.027 --> 03:26:53.971]  They had a gridlock, this is around Thanksgiving, they had a gridlock
[03:26:54.471 --> 03:26:57.953]  That kept some people stuck in stores for three days.
[03:26:57.973 --> 03:27:03.015]  That's why it's maybe a good idea to have some supplies, a bug-out bag with you.
[03:27:03.075 --> 03:27:11.479]  I know people who always travel with a bug-out bag in the back of their trunk with some supplies, some storable foods, that type of thing.
[03:27:12.299 --> 03:27:15.181]  Let's go to a couple of the calls and we'll go back to these articles.
[03:27:15.481 --> 03:27:16.621]  Kevin in Florida.
[03:27:16.681 --> 03:27:18.062]  Go ahead, you had some solutions.
[03:27:19.721 --> 03:27:20.782]  Thank you, David.
[03:27:21.683 --> 03:27:29.168]  My question for you is, what domino do you think will have to fall for the non-info warriors to wake up?
[03:27:29.208 --> 03:27:32.351]  Because it feels like there's so much stuff going on.
[03:27:32.371 --> 03:27:40.357]  I mean, when you turn on the TV, all that's being talked about is how black people can't get into the Oscars, when we have this situation with Flint.
[03:27:40.697 --> 03:27:48.844]  And in fact, if Alex wants to see something even truly more amazing than that in Flint, I'm originally from Detroit, and I have family that lives all over there.
[03:27:49.344 --> 03:27:55.775]  You should have Leanne travel down to Dearborn where there are parts of Dearborn that have been totally taken over.
[03:27:55.855 --> 03:27:57.617]  There's nothing written in English.
[03:27:57.698 --> 03:27:58.559]  It's all Arabic.
[03:27:59.140 --> 03:28:01.944]  And they're operating under the strict things of Sharia law.
[03:28:03.294 --> 03:28:04.515]  Yeah, it's a good point.
[03:28:04.815 --> 03:28:05.515]  What does it take?
[03:28:05.755 --> 03:28:06.696]  What does it take for people?
[03:28:06.736 --> 03:28:08.817]  I mean, we look at these stories like we had yesterday.
[03:28:08.857 --> 03:28:13.819]  We put out the Park Service openly bragging about how much land they stole.
[03:28:14.099 --> 03:28:18.441]  Saying, yeah, lands, talking about their group, we're the bad guys.
[03:28:18.741 --> 03:28:22.283]  We take people's property and we always take it for far less than it's worth.
[03:28:22.863 --> 03:28:24.224]  I mean, they brag about this.
[03:28:24.904 --> 03:28:25.545]  What does it take?
[03:28:25.685 --> 03:28:29.530]  I mean, they're about to take our ability to move around freely in this country.
[03:28:29.570 --> 03:28:33.054]  That's a key part of what is going on with the driverless cars.
[03:28:33.094 --> 03:28:41.463]  It's not going to be you get to choose your, you know, as you said about the insurance plan, you know, you like your insurance policy, you can keep your insurance policy.
[03:28:41.604 --> 03:28:42.965]  You like your car, you can keep your car.
[03:28:43.005 --> 03:28:43.105]  No.
[03:28:43.766 --> 03:28:44.707]  They're going to change that.
[03:28:44.747 --> 03:28:49.729]  They're going to have not only vehicle-to-vehicle communication, but vehicle-to-infrastructure communication.
[03:28:49.749 --> 03:28:58.494]  They're going to be talking and collecting, talking to your car, collecting all this information, turning every stoplight into the equivalent of a stoplight camera.
[03:28:58.894 --> 03:29:01.155]  They're going to be micromanaging the way you drive.
[03:29:01.175 --> 03:29:10.420]  The insurance companies are going to be looking at how quickly you take the corners, how quickly you brake, the speed limit that you're traveling every inch of the way that you're going.
[03:29:10.460 --> 03:29:12.862]  They will use that information to raise your insurance rates,
[03:29:13.382 --> 03:29:14.903]  To force you out of your car.
[03:29:15.384 --> 03:29:17.185]  And then they're going to offer the solution.
[03:29:17.226 --> 03:29:19.067]  This is their ideal solution.
[03:29:19.087 --> 03:29:20.568]  You're going to pick up the phone.
[03:29:20.869 --> 03:29:25.473]  You're going to call and summon a driverless car as your chauffeur.
[03:29:25.493 --> 03:29:26.434]  Okay?
[03:29:27.154 --> 03:29:28.315]  Let me explain something to you.
[03:29:28.876 --> 03:29:29.817]  These driverless cars...
[03:29:30.177 --> 03:29:32.899]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with more of your calls.
[03:29:58.661 --> 03:30:01.671]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.614 --> 03:30:05.302]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.904 --> 03:30:15.828]  In early January, the hermit nation of North Korea announced that it had successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb.
[03:30:16.069 --> 03:30:19.912]  This would make the fourth successful test that the isolated nation has claimed.
[03:30:20.272 --> 03:30:30.239]  Analysts at the time said this was Kim Jong-un in a display of saber-rattling to mark his birthday and to highlight a rare ruling party congress scheduled for May, the first gathering of its kind in 35 years.
[03:30:31.480 --> 03:30:33.842]  But just yesterday, Fox News reported that U.S.
[03:30:33.882 --> 03:30:39.546]  diplomats have stepped up pressure on China to play a leading role in punishing North Korea for its most recent test.
[03:30:39.866 --> 03:30:40.266]  The U.S.
[03:30:40.306 --> 03:30:42.728]  is also stepping up its military presence in that region.
[03:30:42.948 --> 03:30:50.133]  There are now two aircraft carriers stationed near Tokyo, the latest containing 26 fighter jets, including the F-22 stealth aircraft.
[03:30:50.313 --> 03:30:50.673]  The U.S.
[03:30:50.713 --> 03:30:53.455]  military has stated that this is for training purposes only.
[03:30:53.635 --> 03:31:00.748]  But as the economy goes into free fall, could these training exercises provoke the nation of North Korea into carrying out real attacks?
[03:31:01.369 --> 03:31:04.074]  Stay tuned to InfoWars.com as more news breaks.
[03:31:04.514 --> 03:31:06.838]  Rob Due reporting for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:31:09.787 --> 03:31:13.512]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[03:31:13.772 --> 03:31:19.900]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[03:31:20.081 --> 03:31:27.070]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[03:31:27.350 --> 03:31:36.202]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[03:31:36.482 --> 03:31:42.410]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[03:31:42.650 --> 03:31:45.333]  Methocobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[03:31:46.034 --> 03:31:46.835]  We're good to go.
[03:32:09.477 --> 03:32:14.279]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[03:33:12.557 --> 03:33:15.580]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:33:16.160 --> 03:33:20.304]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:26.784 --> 03:33:30.648]  I'm David Knight, your host, and we've got a couple of people who've been holding for quite some time.
[03:33:30.708 --> 03:33:37.136]  I want to get to Steve in California, and then we're going to talk about something that's happening in North Carolina.
[03:33:37.156 --> 03:33:41.080]  I see this as crony capitalism really coming full circle.
[03:33:43.403 --> 03:33:49.186]  I saw crony capitalism when I look at American history, and of course there were evidences of it beforehand.
[03:33:49.466 --> 03:33:54.188]  Part of the dispute between the North and the South was what the South called internal improvements.
[03:33:54.228 --> 03:34:01.131]  In other words, they didn't want to pay for infrastructure that was only going to benefit Northern states, something like the Erie Canal.
[03:34:01.311 --> 03:34:06.833]  People in Virginia would say, why should I be taxed to build an Erie Canal in Pennsylvania?
[03:34:07.513 --> 03:34:13.316]  You're just redistributing wealth, and of course there were elements of that, but it really took off after the Civil War.
[03:34:13.416 --> 03:34:35.569]  The GOP got into bed with the crony capitalists, the robber barons, the railroad companies, and now we have a situation in North Carolina where you've got a railroad company, CSX, wants to build a large rail terminal, and they not only want massive state subsidies, but this railroad company wants to use eminent domain.
[03:34:36.349 --> 03:34:38.530]  To take the property for their private use.
[03:34:39.050 --> 03:34:40.311]  Where have we seen this before?
[03:34:40.591 --> 03:34:42.011]  So we'll talk about that in just a moment.
[03:34:42.292 --> 03:34:45.353]  Before we do, I want to go to Steve who's been hanging on for a long time.
[03:34:45.393 --> 03:34:45.933]  Steve, go ahead.
[03:34:47.234 --> 03:34:48.094]  Hey David, how are you?
[03:34:48.394 --> 03:34:48.734]  Doing good.
[03:34:49.034 --> 03:34:49.535]  Thanks for calling.
[03:34:49.755 --> 03:34:50.075]  Alright.
[03:34:50.135 --> 03:34:59.239]  Hey, my question was regarding what Obama said on his visit to Russia about waiting until after the election in 2016 and then
[03:35:01.105 --> 03:35:12.317]  Uh, in recent months with, um, appearances of, uh, missiles, do you see a possible correlation, uh, or have any insight into what Obama was talking about?
[03:35:13.689 --> 03:35:23.212]  I mean, I'm thinking possibly missile launches, false flag for, you know, security or national security.
[03:35:23.232 --> 03:35:23.672]  Who knows?
[03:35:24.132 --> 03:35:24.833]  Exactly, who knows?
[03:35:24.853 --> 03:35:31.835]  I mean, you look at the X-Files trailer that's for the premiere that's coming up this week, and of course they're changing that, it looks like.
[03:35:32.515 --> 03:35:43.219]  They've still got alien technology in it, still have the UFO angle in it, but they've gone a lot more into the New World Order false flag type of plot lines for the X-Files.
[03:35:43.239 --> 03:35:48.422]  And of course, one of the things they say is, you know, it starts out, it'll start on a Friday or Saturday or something like that.
[03:35:48.442 --> 03:35:50.683]  It'll look like a terrorist attack or look like Russia attacked.
[03:35:52.063 --> 03:35:55.504]  They want to have uncertainty, fear and doubt.
[03:35:55.784 --> 03:36:00.725]  They want to make sure that you are going to run to them for safety.
[03:36:00.745 --> 03:36:05.285]  But they also want to have the military-industrial complex have a profit center.
[03:36:05.646 --> 03:36:07.986]  All of these things boil into this.
[03:36:08.326 --> 03:36:12.167]  And when you look at Davos, they look at the collapsing economy.
[03:36:12.507 --> 03:36:14.007]  They know there's going to be a lot of unrest.
[03:36:14.067 --> 03:36:15.667]  They need to distract your attention.
[03:36:15.967 --> 03:36:18.408]  One of the ways that's always been done throughout history.
[03:36:19.128 --> 03:36:19.969]  Is with wars.
[03:36:20.309 --> 03:36:23.310]  We know that the banks have always profited from the wars.
[03:36:23.350 --> 03:36:25.611]  They've always profited from chaos.
[03:36:25.771 --> 03:36:28.973]  And they've always funded Marxists, for example.
[03:36:28.993 --> 03:36:36.756]  I mean, they gave Lenin 10 million dollars, put him on a train, seal the train and send him from Switzerland into Russia to start the revolution there.
[03:36:36.796 --> 03:36:38.077]  They want chaos.
[03:36:38.137 --> 03:36:43.840]  Whenever things are, markets are collapsing or markets are soaring, they make money.
[03:36:44.060 --> 03:36:46.081]  If everything is stable, they don't like that.
[03:36:46.641 --> 03:36:50.404]  They do want to have stable control of who's in charge.
[03:36:50.444 --> 03:36:52.246]  That's why they don't like Trump.
[03:36:52.266 --> 03:36:54.228]  That's why they're concerned about this at Davos.
[03:36:54.748 --> 03:37:06.958]  They're looking at this and saying, wait a minute, this is a guy that we don't have any hooks into yet, like we do Hillary or Jeb or Rubio or these other people that Goldman Sachs is giving lots of money to.
[03:37:07.879 --> 03:37:09.139]  So, they're concerned about that.
[03:37:09.159 --> 03:37:10.760]  They want to have this in the background.
[03:37:10.800 --> 03:37:22.722]  They know that besides the typical boom and bust cycles that they've engineered with the banks, with the central banks especially, they know that there is massive upheaval that is coming with artificial intelligence.
[03:37:22.782 --> 03:37:31.004]  This is something that isn't just going to be like the upheaval that we saw with the change from an agrarian to an industrial society.
[03:37:31.044 --> 03:37:33.865]  This is going to affect every aspect of life.
[03:37:33.985 --> 03:37:36.006]  It's not just going to affect factory workers.
[03:37:36.346 --> 03:37:38.167]  It's going to affect knowledge workers.
[03:37:38.227 --> 03:37:41.049]  It's going to affect white-collar workers, blue-collar workers.
[03:37:41.169 --> 03:37:42.449]  It's going to affect everyone.
[03:37:42.489 --> 03:37:44.490]  We're going to see massive unemployment.
[03:37:44.831 --> 03:37:46.572]  It's going to be incredibly disruptive.
[03:37:46.872 --> 03:37:49.293]  They want to have a way that they can control that.
[03:37:49.333 --> 03:37:50.954]  And, of course, they want to have conflict.
[03:37:51.314 --> 03:37:56.838]  I mean, they have an economic reason to restart the Cold War, but they have other reasons to restart that.
[03:37:56.898 --> 03:37:59.199]  So, I really don't know what's going on with it.
[03:37:59.239 --> 03:38:05.883]  I can tell you that, and let me run down through some of what they're talking about in Davos that is really freaking them out.
[03:38:06.264 --> 03:38:13.168]  This is Eric Cantor, okay, talking, and remember Eric Cantor, he was the number two to John Boehner, and he lost in a primary.
[03:38:13.188 --> 03:38:16.931]  It was pretty unprecedented when he lost in the primary, but what is he doing now?
[03:38:17.651 --> 03:38:22.313]  Well, he's hanging out with the James Bond villains in Davos, and this is what he says.
[03:38:22.713 --> 03:38:28.896]  Unfortunately, I do think that if there were to be a Trump administration, the casualty would be trade.
[03:38:29.116 --> 03:38:32.658]  Cantor says he doesn't think that Trump will make it through the primaries, however.
[03:38:33.378 --> 03:38:34.840]  Yeah, okay.
[03:38:34.860 --> 03:38:36.021]  Just keep telling yourself that.
[03:38:36.261 --> 03:38:38.503]  That's what the GOP has been saying.
[03:38:38.983 --> 03:38:44.267]  Trump's positions, he said, like a temporary ban on Muslims, controlling our borders.
[03:38:44.728 --> 03:38:49.311]  They're earning him the opprobrium of the people at Davos.
[03:38:49.512 --> 03:38:51.934]  And in case you don't know, that's the vilification.
[03:38:51.974 --> 03:38:53.415]  These people detest him.
[03:38:53.875 --> 03:39:06.063]  Because he is rejecting their main tool of control, and that is using open borders to destroy the cultures, the countries, to create conflict within the countries.
[03:39:06.403 --> 03:39:11.266]  It's the same thing they've been doing to Russia for 60 years, using the Muslims against Russia.
[03:39:11.906 --> 03:39:20.090]  It's the same thing they've been doing throughout the Middle East, using one group of Muslims against another, funding these jihadis.
[03:39:20.110 --> 03:39:24.432]  Now they go on to say, a Trump administration would be a disaster, according to them.
[03:39:24.452 --> 03:39:25.772]  This is a former U.S.
[03:39:25.852 --> 03:39:30.074]  Treasury official in the Clinton administration, Beth Brooke Marciniak.
[03:39:30.695 --> 03:39:32.635]  They say, the globe needs the U.S.
[03:39:32.675 --> 03:39:33.656]  to be strong, she said.
[03:39:34.036 --> 03:39:34.456]  The U.S.
[03:39:34.496 --> 03:39:39.777]  is still the horse that's pulling the cart, more so now with capital outflows from emerging markets.
[03:39:39.837 --> 03:39:42.418]  No, listen, they don't want the U.S.
[03:39:42.438 --> 03:39:42.918]  to be strong.
[03:39:43.278 --> 03:39:45.119]  They don't want Europe to be strong.
[03:39:45.519 --> 03:39:46.819]  They need to take us down.
[03:39:46.979 --> 03:39:50.860]  They need to level everything so they can create the society that they want.
[03:39:50.940 --> 03:39:53.800]  That is why they have backed the Marxist dictators in the past.
[03:39:53.860 --> 03:39:55.581]  That's precisely why this is happening.
[03:39:56.261 --> 03:40:05.244]  And again, they tell themselves, well by the time we get to March, April, this is Lawrence Tisch, professor of history at Harvard University, by the time we get to March and April it's all over.
[03:40:05.284 --> 03:40:07.145]  I think it's going to be a wonderful catharsis.
[03:40:07.205 --> 03:40:10.025]  I'm really looking forward to Trump's humiliation.
[03:40:10.045 --> 03:40:10.766]  Okay?
[03:40:11.226 --> 03:40:13.987]  Well, here's this other story that was up on the Drudge Report.
[03:40:15.027 --> 03:40:15.488]  I think so.
[03:40:29.233 --> 03:40:29.573]  Iowa.
[03:40:29.753 --> 03:40:33.516]  And of course, he is way ahead in New Hampshire.
[03:40:33.996 --> 03:40:45.342]  They're pointing out that, and this could be one way that they're trying to raise expectations, saying, well, he didn't do nearly as well as we thought, so his campaign has lost its momentum and so forth.
[03:40:45.362 --> 03:40:47.564]  That's the way they play these games.
[03:40:48.104 --> 03:40:56.729]  As they point out, they say Cruz's campaign has been trying to raise expectations by touting that he's got great ground game in Iowa and so forth and so on.
[03:40:56.749 --> 03:41:07.076]  They say, but a narrow Cruz win would not be an exciting upset, but that if he loses, oh, that would fail expectations.
[03:41:07.116 --> 03:41:08.897]  So that's the way they play this.
[03:41:09.457 --> 03:41:11.420]  And of course, Cruz has been dropping down.
[03:41:11.460 --> 03:41:17.006]  He's now neck and neck, according to these polls, if we can believe them, with Donald Trump.
[03:41:17.647 --> 03:41:20.571]  He has had everybody training their fire on him.
[03:41:20.591 --> 03:41:27.599]  I think in all these cases that I've seen, the criticisms of him have been spot on, same criticisms I would have, but they were
[03:41:28.220 --> 03:41:33.462]  Training all their shots at Marco Rubio a couple of weeks ago, now it's all at Ted Cruz.
[03:41:33.582 --> 03:41:37.903]  Even the Iowa governor has done kind of a dis-endorsement.
[03:41:37.963 --> 03:41:47.247]  He didn't endorse anybody else, but what he said was essentially anybody but Ted Cruz, because Ted Cruz has opposed ethanol subsidies, which basically I oppose.
[03:41:47.307 --> 03:41:50.148]  I mean, I agree with Ted Cruz on some of these issues, as I've said before.
[03:41:50.808 --> 03:42:01.840]  I think it is important for him, if he's going to be putting himself out there as a constitutionalist, he needs to make the case for his eligibility according to a strict interpretation of the Constitution.
[03:42:02.260 --> 03:42:07.907]  Does he have a case there, or is he just going to say, well, if you don't let me in, then Rubio couldn't run either.
[03:42:08.327 --> 03:42:09.308]  That's not a defense.
[03:42:09.448 --> 03:42:12.251]  That's not a defense for somebody who says he's a constitutionalist.
[03:42:13.032 --> 03:42:21.838]  And the other thing that concerns me, as well as most of these other people, this article that's on Politico, Goldman Sachs contributions surge despite attacks.
[03:42:22.278 --> 03:42:27.681]  They say Goldman Sachs is on track to be one of the biggest contributors in the presidential race again this year, with $800,000 chipped in so far.
[03:42:30.183 --> 03:42:33.966]  They said, but of course they've spread their allegiances across the political map.
[03:42:34.006 --> 03:42:34.546]  Of course they would.
[03:42:34.586 --> 03:42:35.487]  That's the way these guys do.
[03:42:35.507 --> 03:42:38.809]  They fund all the people they believe they can control.
[03:42:39.049 --> 03:42:39.970]  They give them all money.
[03:42:40.290 --> 03:42:41.471]  They're hedging their bets.
[03:42:41.931 --> 03:42:43.612]  They say top contributors to Republican.
[03:42:43.732 --> 03:42:49.676]  They've been one of the top contributors to Republican campaigns of Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and of course Ted Cruz.
[03:42:49.777 --> 03:42:52.959]  And they're a big contributor to Hillary Clinton.
[03:42:53.719 --> 03:43:00.285]  They doled out $675,000 to her in speaking fees after she left office.
[03:43:00.445 --> 03:43:02.547]  That's money, of course, that she gets directly.
[03:43:02.587 --> 03:43:04.329]  They give it to a super PAC.
[03:43:05.189 --> 03:43:09.413]  It could create problems for her if she tries to launder that money in some way to get out of the super PAC.
[03:43:09.433 --> 03:43:17.900]  But if they give you speaking fees, that's the way they've done it for the Clintons typically, they can give you a million bucks and it doesn't really raise any red flags with the FEC.
[03:43:18.621 --> 03:43:21.942]  And of course we've talked about Ted Cruz's situation with Goldman Sachs.
[03:43:21.982 --> 03:43:24.243]  His wife is a major executive there.
[03:43:24.323 --> 03:43:28.504]  Trump said when he was speaking, Goldman Sachs owns Cruz.
[03:43:28.844 --> 03:43:29.685]  Remember that, folks?
[03:43:29.725 --> 03:43:30.745]  He said they own him.
[03:43:31.525 --> 03:43:40.208]  And they go on to point out that Goldman Sachs was the second biggest money source for Barack Obama, the second biggest money source for Hillary Clinton.
[03:43:40.588 --> 03:43:42.529]  See, these banks want to make sure
[03:43:43.649 --> 03:43:47.834]  That they're open borders, that they're destruction of national sovereignty.
[03:43:47.874 --> 03:43:54.521]  They want to pull down the open borders, bring in massive numbers of immigrants, and they want to consolidate everything.
[03:43:54.561 --> 03:43:55.362]  We've talked about this.
[03:43:55.442 --> 03:44:00.508]  That's what's behind, fundamentally, these Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnership agreements.
[03:44:00.528 --> 03:44:04.592]  The things that Eric Cantor and the GOP establishment are so concerned
[03:44:05.293 --> 03:44:06.495]  That they're not stopped.
[03:44:06.535 --> 03:44:08.938]  And I don't know if a Donald Trump would stop that or not.
[03:44:09.820 --> 03:44:15.789]  He hasn't spoken out on it, he thinks it's a bad deal, but he hasn't said that he thinks it's a bad deal in principle.
[03:44:15.809 --> 03:44:16.870]  And that concerns me.
[03:44:17.351 --> 03:44:20.435]  Nevertheless, look at what Goldman Sachs is also doing in Britain.
[03:44:20.976 --> 03:44:27.518]  They have donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the campaign Keep Britain in the European Union.
[03:44:27.798 --> 03:44:38.721]  This is Sky News exclusively revealing Goldman Sachs has agreed to give what insiders say was a substantial six-figure sum to keeping the UK in the EU.
[03:44:38.801 --> 03:44:39.801]  They're very concerned.
[03:44:40.101 --> 03:44:41.442]  They don't want that to come down.
[03:44:41.502 --> 03:44:42.802]  This is what they are building.
[03:44:42.822 --> 03:44:45.363]  They're building regional consolidations as we pointed out before.
[03:44:45.803 --> 03:44:55.411]  Consolidating Europe together into an economic trading bloc, then moving that into a political sovereignty, and of course we've seen that also being done.
[03:44:56.152 --> 03:44:59.355]  Controlling the population by massive immigration and open borders.
[03:44:59.775 --> 03:45:02.538]  Doing the same thing in America as well.
[03:45:02.898 --> 03:45:08.263]  And then once they create the North American Union, the European Union, then they pull them together again.
[03:45:08.903 --> 03:45:25.699]  Economically, with these trade agreements, which are really trade treaties, and anybody who voted for these trade treaties, people like Ted Cruz, even though he voted once for the Trade Promotion Authority, and then voted against it when it was clearly going to win,
[03:45:26.540 --> 03:45:45.354]  If you vote for the Trade Promotion Authority for the Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic Partnership and several other agreements that are on the table, this is giving a blank check to the administration for six years to bring anything that they wish in and ram this thing through without amendment, without discussion, without debate, without filibuster.
[03:45:46.516 --> 03:45:56.223]  These are treaties, and anybody who voted for this Trade Promotion Authority, and again, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Trans-Atlantic Partnership, none of these things have come up for a vote yet.
[03:45:56.864 --> 03:46:08.513]  But when they voted for the Trade Promotion Authority, what they voted to do was to remove the constitutional process that said you needed to have two-thirds of the Senate vote for a new treaty.
[03:46:09.133 --> 03:46:10.314]  These trade agreements are treaties.
[03:46:10.694 --> 03:46:11.735]  NAFTA was a treaty.
[03:46:12.295 --> 03:46:21.662]  The people who represent trade disputes and arbitration, all these lawyers, if you look at their sites, they talk about themselves as being treaty lawyers.
[03:46:21.782 --> 03:46:23.244]  Everybody knows that's a treaty.
[03:46:23.724 --> 03:46:24.585]  It's clearly a treaty.
[03:46:25.441 --> 03:46:29.865]  These trans-pacific partnerships, even if they want to call them that, they are treaties.
[03:46:30.225 --> 03:46:36.970]  They were written by corporations, and they're going to be rammed through without the constitutional process to ratify a treaty, but they are treaties.
[03:46:37.030 --> 03:46:43.115]  And anybody who voted for that TPA has absolutely no respect for the Constitution that they merely use as a beard.
[03:46:43.135 --> 03:46:43.876]  Let's understand that.
[03:46:44.096 --> 03:46:48.784]  I mean, how many different ways do we have to point out that the Constitution is a dead letter?
[03:46:48.844 --> 03:46:55.534]  Nevertheless, they salute it, they swear to it, they hold it up and tell you this is something that is going to protect you.
[03:46:56.311 --> 03:47:00.554]  Now, as we're looking at what Goldman Sachs is doing, Goldman Sachs is very concerned.
[03:47:00.574 --> 03:47:01.375]  They're not happy.
[03:47:02.255 --> 03:47:05.497]  They're putting their money behind the establishment candidates in both parties.
[03:47:05.858 --> 03:47:09.961]  We see the people at Davos saying, we're very concerned about Trump.
[03:47:10.001 --> 03:47:12.522]  It's going to be very chaotic if he gets in there.
[03:47:12.542 --> 03:47:20.308]  They're not worried about the chaos that they're inflicting on Europe by massive migration of Muslims, but they're very concerned that somebody they don't control could get in.
[03:47:20.348 --> 03:47:23.030]  And so what we see happening here is, interestingly enough,
[03:47:23.550 --> 03:47:31.516]  We've seen the UK Parliament last week debating for three hours whether Donald Trump ought to be declared persona non grata, not allowed into their country.
[03:47:31.957 --> 03:47:41.524]  Now we see Alex Salmon, who is a former Scottish National Party leader, trying to challenge Trump to a debate, taunting him because he's not debating.
[03:47:42.044 --> 03:47:44.887]  Let me explain something to the globalists in the UK.
[03:47:46.360 --> 03:47:49.423]  We settled the argument over a couple hundred years ago, back in 1776.
[03:47:49.723 --> 03:47:55.029]  We settled the argument that you don't get to have any say-so in our politics, okay?
[03:47:55.569 --> 03:48:03.778]  We could care less about the fact that you debate about somebody being allowed to have free speech for three hours in your parliament.
[03:48:03.798 --> 03:48:05.019]  You want to waste your time doing that?
[03:48:05.079 --> 03:48:05.479]  Go ahead.
[03:48:05.820 --> 03:48:06.200]  Who cares?
[03:48:06.660 --> 03:48:07.000]  Okay?
[03:48:07.401 --> 03:48:10.522]  You want to say that you want to challenge him to a debate on whatever?
[03:48:10.923 --> 03:48:11.343]  Who cares?
[03:48:11.363 --> 03:48:12.483]  He doesn't have to debate you.
[03:48:12.523 --> 03:48:16.285]  Who cares what this guy, Alex Salmon, has anybody in the U.S.
[03:48:16.806 --> 03:48:18.647]  heard his name before I just mentioned it here?
[03:48:18.787 --> 03:48:19.707]  He's a nobody.
[03:48:19.747 --> 03:48:21.268]  Why would anybody waste their time on that?
[03:48:21.968 --> 03:48:27.211]  Nevertheless, as we see what they're doing with this, it is the same sort of thing that they're doing to Putin right now.
[03:48:27.552 --> 03:48:29.372]  You see how they manipulate the media.
[03:48:29.392 --> 03:48:31.974]  I think it's very interesting to look at how they manipulate the media.
[03:48:32.514 --> 03:48:35.236]  We now have this 10-year-old case.
[03:48:36.156 --> 03:48:39.539]  of Litvinenko, who was clearly murdered.
[03:48:40.620 --> 03:48:52.229]  Now they're pulling this out after 10 years and saying Putin approved this, Putin has direct involvement in this, he was personally involved in this some way, after 10 years.
[03:48:52.790 --> 03:49:02.037]  This is what we're talking about, about the very dangerous revival of the Cold War, and this is all coming out of the desperation at Davos.
[03:49:02.938 --> 03:49:08.501]  Going back to that first article I just talked about, where we talked about the specter of Donald Trump is haunting Davos.
[03:49:08.941 --> 03:49:15.164]  No, the people who together, collectively, are specter, are concerned about what's going on.
[03:49:15.184 --> 03:49:17.346]  And they're concerned about politicians, good or bad.
[03:49:17.406 --> 03:49:18.706]  I'm not saying that Trump's a good guy.
[03:49:18.726 --> 03:49:20.007]  I'm not saying Putin's a good guy.
[03:49:20.027 --> 03:49:20.487]  Okay?
[03:49:20.507 --> 03:49:22.568]  There's a lot of things I don't like about either one of them.
[03:49:22.909 --> 03:49:26.691]  They're concerned, though, about anybody that they don't control.
[03:49:27.671 --> 03:49:37.523]  And they're concerned because they're afraid they're going to lose control as the economy starts to spiral down, as we start to see automation take more than half of the jobs.
[03:49:38.044 --> 03:49:43.410]  And one of the things that they're going to do to control us is a control grid of your transportation.
[03:49:44.011 --> 03:49:46.413]  They're going to track you, everything that you do.
[03:49:46.513 --> 03:49:48.995]  Go back to what we were talking about with Jade Helm.
[03:49:49.635 --> 03:49:51.216]  Mastering the human domain.
[03:49:51.256 --> 03:49:52.437]  What was the basis of that?
[03:49:53.078 --> 03:49:54.579]  Geospatial intelligence.
[03:49:54.639 --> 03:49:57.861]  The fastest growing area of intelligence that our government has had.
[03:49:58.382 --> 03:50:03.205]  It's composed of things like activity-based intelligence, human domain analytics.
[03:50:03.606 --> 03:50:04.946]  It's the metadata, stupid.
[03:50:05.407 --> 03:50:06.588]  That's what they really want.
[03:50:07.108 --> 03:50:12.472]  Even though you've got James Clapper and others saying, well, you know, we're not recording your conversations, we're just getting your metadata.
[03:50:12.652 --> 03:50:15.034]  That is more important than your conversation.
[03:50:15.514 --> 03:50:20.178]  It's more easily mined than your conversations.
[03:50:20.598 --> 03:50:22.259]  And so that's fundamentally what they're about.
[03:50:22.460 --> 03:50:27.783]  When they impose this massive control and surveillance grid, remember they talked about Davos again.
[03:50:27.964 --> 03:50:33.268]  They were talking about how they're going to use self-driving cars as surveillance tools, like drones and satellites.
[03:50:34.269 --> 03:50:34.549]  Okay?
[03:50:34.969 --> 03:50:41.892]  The self-driving robot cars, the vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication that you're going to be forced to buy.
[03:50:42.372 --> 03:50:51.776]  Understand that just as they remove these regulations for self-driving cars for Silicon Valley, give them subsidies, they're going to mandate that within a couple years you're going to put these things in your car.
[03:50:51.796 --> 03:50:53.557]  They're looking at a $46 billion industry by 2020.
[03:50:58.059 --> 03:50:58.679]  2020, okay?
[03:50:59.160 --> 03:51:01.822]  Less than four years, they're going to be making $46 billion.
[03:51:02.122 --> 03:51:06.927]  So we get the mandates, we get the fees, they get the subsidies, they get the regulations taken off.
[03:51:06.947 --> 03:51:07.908]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:10.236 --> 03:51:18.260]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:18.961 --> 03:51:19.681]  What did I do?
[03:51:20.441 --> 03:51:27.745]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:28.365 --> 03:51:36.630]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[03:51:37.330 --> 03:51:41.754]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:42.494 --> 03:51:45.857]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.
[03:51:46.157 --> 03:51:47.859]  To get your Xtendivite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:48.019 --> 03:51:49.040]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:49.060 --> 03:51:52.082]  Xtendivite is only $69.95 for a 2-month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:52:09.154 --> 03:52:12.635]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[03:52:13.376 --> 03:52:13.896]  It's true.
[03:52:14.016 --> 03:52:17.957]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[03:52:18.157 --> 03:52:20.018]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[03:52:20.558 --> 03:52:25.019]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[03:52:25.339 --> 03:52:37.955]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[03:52:38.215 --> 03:52:41.700]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[03:52:42.000 --> 03:52:44.281]  The gold standard in water purification.

[03:52:48.963 --> 03:52:49.583]  Big Berkey.
[03:52:49.783 --> 03:52:53.285]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[03:52:53.485 --> 03:52:55.086]  Get your Big Berkey today.

[03:54:24.372 --> 03:54:25.833]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:25.853 --> 03:54:28.616]  I'm David Knight and joining me in the studio is Darren McBreen.
[03:54:28.636 --> 03:54:30.698]  We're going to talk about what's going to be on the nightly news tonight.
[03:54:30.738 --> 03:54:41.368]  Before I get to Darren, I just want to let you know that we have a special, this week only, Survival Shield X2 and Super Male Vitality 15% off at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:54:41.768 --> 03:54:45.112]  Both X2 and Super Male Vitality have thousands of five-star reviews, over 90% of
[03:54:45.572 --> 03:54:45.973]  We're good to go.

[03:55:12.962 --> 03:55:17.585]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0 is the most advanced multivitamin mineral complex to date.
[03:55:17.906 --> 03:55:21.548]  It provides you with the highest quality essential nutrients your body needs for optimal health.

[03:55:25.311 --> 03:55:26.892]  That is something that will get you going.
[03:55:27.212 --> 03:55:29.193]  Again, that's at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[03:55:29.473 --> 03:55:33.456]  You can find those and other key nutrients available there as well.
[03:55:33.576 --> 03:55:36.519]  Well, Darren, what's going to be on the nightly news tonight?
[03:55:52.034 --> 03:55:56.739]  And one caught my attention the other day, and I'm actually going to go through and break it down.
[03:55:56.779 --> 03:55:58.060]  If you guys could pull it up right now.
[03:55:58.080 --> 03:56:03.185]  And this is about after Obama's been in the White House for seven years, right?
[03:56:03.265 --> 03:56:05.267]  And this is a meme that's very popular right now.
[03:56:05.327 --> 03:56:07.589]  And it says, you still have your guns.
[03:56:07.869 --> 03:56:09.471]  You don't live in FEMA camps.
[03:56:09.972 --> 03:56:11.973]  You don't have government implants.
[03:56:12.614 --> 03:56:14.495]  And you don't live under Sharia law.
[03:56:14.895 --> 03:56:17.717]  There's still no such thing as a death panel.
[03:56:18.097 --> 03:56:20.319]  Gay marriage hasn't ruined the country.
[03:56:20.679 --> 03:56:22.820]  You've seen the birth certificate.
[03:56:23.260 --> 03:56:26.262]  And he still hasn't risen as the Antichrist.
[03:56:26.662 --> 03:56:29.224]  Do you feel like a dumbass yet?
[03:56:31.348 --> 03:56:32.930]  Right, and I just think it's very interesting.
[03:56:32.970 --> 03:56:34.893]  And what a bullet point list that is.
[03:56:34.973 --> 03:56:36.455]  I mean, how do you respond to that?
[03:56:36.555 --> 03:56:40.520]  So I'm going to actually break it down bullet by bullet and kind of just talk about that.
[03:56:40.621 --> 03:56:44.386]  I think we're a lot closer on every one of those bullet points to that coming true.
[03:56:44.586 --> 03:56:46.368]  Hey, he wants to be a head of the UN, right?
[03:56:46.388 --> 03:56:48.972]  So if he's not the Antichrist yet, I guess give him time.
[03:56:49.192 --> 03:56:50.233]  We're talking about memes.
[03:56:50.433 --> 03:56:52.556]  I saw this story about Bernie Sanders.
[03:56:52.756 --> 03:56:54.498]  Of course, they were saying he's just too white.
[03:56:54.578 --> 03:57:00.224]  But they're also talking about how he's got a new ad that's going to Simon & Garfunkel's America.
[03:57:00.244 --> 03:57:08.973]  And you know, it really goes in and channels this hippie nostalgia, which is really what's driving Bernie, you know, more so than his whiteness, you know, going back to the 1960s.
[03:57:10.434 --> 03:57:12.977]  And he really is still stuck.
[03:57:13.277 --> 03:57:19.402]  I guess they could go in and try to make him not quite as white instead of bringing in the director of Straight Outta Compton or something.
[03:57:19.703 --> 03:57:23.546]  But this is a guy who is straight out of Nicaragua and the Sandinistas.
[03:57:23.566 --> 03:57:24.987]  That's why I call him Bernie Sandinista.
[03:57:26.789 --> 03:57:31.431]  You know, he really is like a Che Guevara t-shirt, you know?
[03:57:31.772 --> 03:57:35.413]  He hasn't learned anything since the 1960s.
[03:57:35.754 --> 03:57:39.956]  He hasn't learned anything from the failures of the Central American countries.
[03:57:40.176 --> 03:57:45.518]  He hasn't learned anything from the crony capitalism that was imposed by those Marxist dictators.
[03:57:45.558 --> 03:57:50.421]  He thinks, and tells everybody, unfortunately, that the only place you're going to get crony capitalism is on Wall Street.
[03:57:50.761 --> 03:57:54.983]  No, Wall Street operates through people like Hugo Chavez.
[03:57:55.103 --> 03:57:55.584]  Absolutely.
[03:57:56.984 --> 03:57:58.324]  700% ROI.
[03:57:58.904 --> 03:58:00.005]  Okay, return on their investment.
[03:58:00.485 --> 03:58:07.866]  At the same time, Bloomberg is saying that, hey, we got, they've been a great investment for us, even though their people can't get food, water, and medicine.
[03:58:08.286 --> 03:58:10.887]  But he also knows he has a very naive following.
[03:58:11.107 --> 03:58:11.287]  Yeah.
[03:58:11.307 --> 03:58:16.008]  You know, and a lot of people are just starting, especially the younger population, they don't have a clue, David.
[03:58:16.168 --> 03:58:16.528]  That's right.
[03:58:16.748 --> 03:58:20.129]  So maybe they have a dual t-shirt with a Che and a Bernie.
[03:58:20.149 --> 03:58:20.829]  I don't know.
[03:58:21.109 --> 03:58:23.730]  Well, that's it for today's radio broadcast.
[03:58:24.191 --> 03:58:26.912]  Join Darren tonight at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:26.992 --> 03:58:28.333]  Eastern for the nightly news.
