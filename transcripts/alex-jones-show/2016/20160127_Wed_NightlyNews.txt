[00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:21.692]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:23.075]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:25.760]  It is January 27th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.223]  Tonight, the FBI and the mainstream media is calling it a shootout.
[00:00:36.843 --> 00:00:49.430]  As one person is dead, an organ protest leader, Ammon Bundy, along with several others, are now behind bars after a highway confrontation with the FBI and state police.
[00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:55.774]  Meanwhile, some of the protest members are being accused of being agent provocateurs.
[00:00:56.394 --> 00:01:02.697]  Then, Barack Obama turns against Hillary and invites Bernie Sanders to the White House.
[00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:06.839]  Could this mean that a Hillary Clinton indictment is happening soon?
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.120]  God, let's hope so.
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:18.745]  Then, a new policy in a Massachusetts town wants firearm applicants to write an essay explaining why they need a gun.
[00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:19.586]  Really?
[00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.748]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:31.583]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:33.163]  You can't survive without it.
[00:01:33.363 --> 00:01:34.264]  But where do you get it?
[00:01:34.564 --> 00:01:40.326]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:46.268]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:01:46.468 --> 00:02:03.329]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.850]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.391]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:08.451]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:09.332]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:09.632 --> 00:02:11.453]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:02:33.936 --> 00:02:45.832]  The Oregon standoff has been a very tricky situation, because while I do support people's right to assemble, I support people's Second Amendment right to bear arms, even open carry, the issue is that
[00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.515]  The assistance that was being granted to the Hammond family wasn't exactly solicited, to say the least.
[00:02:53.875 --> 00:03:04.923]  And now we have the very unfortunate news that Ammon Bundy has been arrested, and one of the protesters in the Oregon situation, I don't want to necessarily call it a standoff, but the situation, has been shot and killed.
[00:03:05.763 --> 00:03:09.608]  Shots were reportedly fired after authorities stopped the protesters on U.S.
[00:03:09.628 --> 00:03:19.001]  Highway 395 while they were heading to a community meeting in John Day, Oregon, on the 24th day of the Wildlife Refuge occupation.
[00:03:20.017 --> 00:03:31.044]  It's unclear who started shooting, although sources reported that Arizona rancher LaVoy Finicum, who had gained fame for conducting a TV interview from beneath a blue tarp, was killed.
[00:03:49.957 --> 00:03:50.678]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:03:50.698 --> 00:03:51.038]  I think?
[00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:52.519]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.919]  I think?
[00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:53.680]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.940]  I think?
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.680]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.121]  I think?
[00:03:55.141 --> 00:03:55.841]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:56.061]  I think?
[00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:57.282]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:03:57.322 --> 00:03:57.542]  I think?
[00:03:57.562 --> 00:03:58.243]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:03:58.323 --> 00:03:58.483]  I think?
[00:03:58.503 --> 00:03:59.964]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:03:59.984 --> 00:04:00.224]  I think?
[00:04:00.244 --> 00:04:00.945]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:04:00.965 --> 00:04:01.505]  I think?
[00:04:01.645 --> 00:04:02.386]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:04:02.406 --> 00:04:02.786]  I think?
[00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:03.887]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:04:03.947 --> 00:04:04.147]  I think?
[00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:05.588]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:04:05.688 --> 00:04:05.988]  I think?
[00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:07.029]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.269]  I think?
[00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:08.690]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.070]  I think?
[00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.751]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:09.971]  I think?
[00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:10.952]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:04:11.452 --> 00:04:11.652]  I think?
[00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:12.453]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:04:12.473 --> 00:04:12.773]  I think?
[00:04:12.813 --> 00:04:13.654]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:13.814]  I think?
[00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:14.654]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:04:14.774 --> 00:04:15.195]  I think?
[00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:15.715]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:15.995]  I think?
[00:04:16.335 --> 00:04:16.656]  Yeah, we're
[00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:24.644]  But now let's go to a video of LaVoy Finicum in his own words, explaining what he was doing standing up to the federal government.
[00:04:25.525 --> 00:04:26.206]  Hello everyone.
[00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:28.028]  My name is LaVoy Finicum.
[00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:33.154]  I'm a neighboring rancher to Clyde and Bundy on the Arizona side of the border.
[00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:38.580]  I rode with his boys on April 12th when we went to go get his cows.
[00:04:39.622 --> 00:04:51.345]  And I feel I'd like to make this video to set the record straight, to maybe offset some very powerful voices such as Glenn Beck, where I believe that we've been misrepresented.
[00:04:51.365 --> 00:04:59.927]  The intent of our heart was not to cause harm or accident, but we did intend to come and get the cows.
[00:05:01.127 --> 00:05:04.328]  We were told to leave or we would be shot.
[00:05:05.608 --> 00:05:09.149]  Now we're in violation of a federal court order.
[00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.751]  We did not leave.
[00:05:14.432 --> 00:05:15.653]  Those were his cows.
[00:05:17.115 --> 00:05:24.182]  You cannot have a federal government sitting as judge upon a federal case.
[00:05:25.363 --> 00:05:34.313]  It's like the administration having Benghazi or the IRS investigated by themselves.
[00:05:35.652 --> 00:05:40.934]  A state court needed to be the impartial judge to represent.
[00:05:41.494 --> 00:05:45.115]  You cannot have a federal judge representing a federal case.
[00:05:45.676 --> 00:05:47.056]  It's a conflict of interest.
[00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:49.097]  We were asked to leave.
[00:05:49.377 --> 00:05:50.297]  We did not leave.
[00:05:51.678 --> 00:05:55.199]  Then they brought in SWAT to show us that they were really serious.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.241]  We stepped forward a little bit, continued to ask for the gates to be open.
[00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.114]  They cocked their guns, charged their weapons, said that if we advanced, they would fire.
[00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:09.895]  We advanced.
[00:06:10.776 --> 00:06:21.063]  At this point, they realized that they were at least going to have to shoot us because cowboys on horses are not going to be pulled off and zip tied.
[00:06:21.744 --> 00:06:26.087]  You can't put a cowboy on a 12,000 pound animal and pull him off.
[00:06:27.108 --> 00:06:30.110]  So the only way that's going to get us off of our horses was to shoot us.
[00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:33.190]  Could you define for us what this means to you personally?
[00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.592]  To me, it's about my children being able to grow up in a free country.
[00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:45.996]  And regardless of what you think about what's going on in Oregon, Americans all around the country are very fed up with the government altogether.
[00:06:46.096 --> 00:06:50.478]  And we see this article by Michael Snyder, Americans really, really hate the government.
[00:06:50.978 --> 00:06:52.679]  And he's talking about a CBS News poll.
[00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.920]  And they had the article saying, Americans hate the U.S.
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.901]  government more than ever.
[00:06:57.341 --> 00:07:11.066]  An average of recent surveys calculated by Real Clear Politics found that 63% of all Americans believe the country is heading in the wrong direction and only 28% of all Americans believe the country is heading in the right direction.
[00:07:11.726 --> 00:07:18.048]  And it's very interesting to me to see poll numbers like this when you consider how many Americans don't consider themselves to be political at all.
[00:07:18.168 --> 00:07:18.488]  We're good to go.
[00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:45.793]  They do, you know, enjoy the FBI or, you know, the Alphabet agencies, and now they're saying that the support of federal agencies is at an eight-year low.
[00:07:46.193 --> 00:07:46.713]  Eight years.
[00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:48.334]  How long has Obama been in office?
[00:07:49.154 --> 00:07:52.235]  And to be very clear, I'm not up here cheerleading for George Bush.
[00:07:52.255 --> 00:07:55.736]  People hear me say something about the Obama administration, oh, you're a Republican.
[00:07:55.756 --> 00:07:57.297]  I'm like, no, I'm not a Republican.
[00:07:57.677 --> 00:08:08.702]  I can tell you all kinds of things about George Bush and his daddy and Reagan and Iran-Contra and Yellow Cake Lies and all that other stuff, so it's not anything particular to this administration or to the Democrats.
[00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:12.044]  I got issues all over, let me tell you that right now.
[00:08:12.604 --> 00:08:16.506]  But yeah, Americans really aren't very happy with the government.
[00:08:17.327 --> 00:08:20.710]  Now I saw this news story right here about the Doomsday Clock.
[00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:29.938]  Now personally, I'm not a big fan of the Doomsday Clock when you consider how it was created by the people who made the nuclear weapons, the atomic weapons.
[00:08:30.819 --> 00:08:37.785]  And I guess they came up with a clock to go along with it because they saw that other people were starting to make nuclear weapons as well.
[00:08:38.365 --> 00:08:41.087]  They said, well, we have to make this timing system.
[00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:42.569]  And now we see the Doomsday Clock.
[00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:47.012]  Threat of oblivion pits humanity at three minutes to midnight, experts say.
[00:08:47.032 --> 00:08:49.354]  And this is the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.
[00:08:49.854 --> 00:08:55.938]  And they recently had a meeting and they decided that they're going to leave the clock as it is, three minutes to midnight.
[00:08:56.479 --> 00:09:06.246]  Now, my view of the clock is it reminds me of kind of a retro version of the terror scale, whatever you call that, the color coded deal, the terror watch.
[00:09:07.126 --> 00:09:11.429]  And, uh, you know, it's red one day, it's orange the next day, it's green the other day.
[00:09:11.789 --> 00:09:22.156]  But nobody really knows, you know, because even if there isn't a terrorist attack, you could be killed in a carjacking or, you know, get shot at a liquor store, you know, have some guy kicking your door at three in the morning.
[00:09:22.256 --> 00:09:25.358]  Any number of things could happen to you, even if you don't get attacked by a terrorist.
[00:09:25.678 --> 00:09:30.882]  So here's probably my favorite explanation of the Doomsday Clock, courtesy of a comic book.
[00:09:31.682 --> 00:09:32.963]  My father was a watchmaker.
[00:09:34.858 --> 00:09:38.141]  He abandoned it when Einstein discovered that time is relative.
[00:09:40.322 --> 00:09:47.508]  I would only agree that a symbolic clock is as nourishing to the intellect as a photograph of oxygen to a drowning man.
[00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.692]  So you're saying there is no danger?
[00:09:52.352 --> 00:09:55.595]  Even in a world without nuclear weapons, there would still be danger.
[00:09:56.493 --> 00:09:57.995]  Well thank you very much, Dr. Manhattan.
[00:09:58.335 --> 00:10:10.067]  Yeah, and the thing about this is, it's always a nuclear war on the horizon, or it's always World War III, or I guess technically World War IV, because the Cold War was World War III.
[00:10:10.427 --> 00:10:14.291]  But yeah, I don't really get off on saying that, you know, nuclear war is imminent now.
[00:10:14.351 --> 00:10:14.972]  Is it possible?
[00:10:15.012 --> 00:10:15.673]  Most definitely.
[00:10:16.013 --> 00:10:17.694]  They have the weapons to do it, not just us.
[00:10:17.794 --> 00:10:20.056]  All around the world, as many other things are possible.
[00:10:20.356 --> 00:10:25.560]  But I don't think it's something that's imminent or something that you should concern yourself with in the immediate future.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:33.366]  And also in the book, The Watchmen, the comedian, the character in the book says, if those nukes do start flying, all of us are going to be done.
[00:10:33.386 --> 00:10:34.727]  There's nothing we can do about it anyway.
[00:10:35.407 --> 00:10:36.548]  Don't worry about nuclear war.
[00:10:36.608 --> 00:10:42.191]  I mean, if you have the ear of a general or somebody else who has their finger on the button, yeah, you may try to keep them at ease.
[00:10:42.251 --> 00:10:45.672]  But just for the normal person out on the street, you can protest nukes and all that stuff.
[00:10:45.692 --> 00:10:49.234]  But if they hit that button, there ain't too much you can do to stop it.
[00:10:49.835 --> 00:10:58.059]  All right, now let's move on to some other news and talk about a possible nuclear situation at the White House as far as the candidates we have to choose from.
[00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:04.242]  It seems that Obama is starting to stray away from Hillary and is now embracing Bernie Sanders.
[00:11:04.642 --> 00:11:05.823]  Colonel Sanders, as it were.
[00:11:06.303 --> 00:11:09.364]  We see Obama turns against Hillary, brings Sanders to White House.
[00:11:10.245 --> 00:11:19.890]  Obama's invitation to the underdog presidential candidate, who until recently struggled to break free of Hillary's dominance, comes as sources reveal the FBI is ready to indict Clinton
[00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:28.034]  And are even willing to blow the whistle and go public with their findings if the Attorney General does not press charges against the Democratic frontrunner.
[00:11:28.074 --> 00:11:32.196]  So, seems like they're trying to get all the horses in the stable ready.
[00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:37.498]  And that's pretty much what politics is, and that's really how I view these presidential debates and all that.
[00:11:37.578 --> 00:11:39.639]  You know, it's like Jesse Ventura said.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.641]  He said, politics is just like wrestling, right?
[00:11:42.981 --> 00:11:46.344]  You know, I hate this guy and this guy's this and that and he's a whatever.
[00:11:46.724 --> 00:11:50.047]  And meanwhile, you know, they go into bars together, hanging out and having steak dinners.
[00:11:50.327 --> 00:11:55.471]  And then they elect each other as vice president or attorney general, even though they supposedly hate each other.
[00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:57.933]  And that's quite honestly my view of Trump.
[00:11:58.373 --> 00:12:04.659]  Among other things, I'm just not very convinced that he is a mortal enemy with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:08.582]  The mere fact that he, by his own admission, invited her to his wedding, I've heard of
[00:12:08.942 --> 00:12:10.723]  Keep your friends close and your enemies close.
[00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:15.527]  I've never heard of invite your enemy to your wedding, but we'll talk more about Trump here in a little bit.
[00:12:15.827 --> 00:12:18.389]  But yeah, Bernie Sanders, I'm not feeling the Bern.
[00:12:18.669 --> 00:12:19.950]  I've talked about him here before.
[00:12:21.571 --> 00:12:30.237]  If I was 17, 18 years old, I may be attracted to the campaign promises of Bernie Sanders, so I don't really fault the young people out there who are really feeling the Bern.
[00:12:30.277 --> 00:12:37.422]  But at the same time, you know, being much older than that, over a decade older than that now, I understand that free stuff isn't free.
[00:12:37.962 --> 00:12:43.687]  And I believe Bernie Sanders said, yeah, we're going to pay for your free health care by upping your taxes.
[00:12:43.707 --> 00:12:46.750]  You're like, well, how is it free if you have to up my taxes to pay for it?
[00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.132]  Like, yeah, that's they could call it free and affordable all they want.
[00:12:50.212 --> 00:12:51.273]  It doesn't make it so.
[00:12:51.614 --> 00:12:56.798]  Just like I can call this instead of calling it a necktie, I call it an elongated neck apparatus.
[00:12:57.138 --> 00:12:59.180]  It doesn't change the fact that it's a necktie.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.380]  You know, you can call it a kinetic action.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.842]  It doesn't change the fact that it's a war or an act of aggression.
[00:13:06.102 --> 00:13:10.343]  But they just use all these words and semantics to confuse you, the American populace.
[00:13:10.383 --> 00:13:13.543]  But don't be confused by Sanders and Hillary.
[00:13:13.643 --> 00:13:15.864]  I don't think either of them are very good candidates.
[00:13:15.964 --> 00:13:18.985]  Personally, I can say the same thing for many, many Republicans as well.
[00:13:20.746 --> 00:13:26.332]  Well, like I said before, if the election was to be held tomorrow, I'd probably go for Rand Paul, but he's having some trouble in the polls.
[00:13:26.432 --> 00:13:28.895]  And quite honestly, I didn't think Rand was going to get there anyway.
[00:13:28.935 --> 00:13:30.397]  Not because he was a bad candidate.
[00:13:30.738 --> 00:13:33.942]  I don't agree with everything he says, but I think he's better than most people.
[00:13:33.982 --> 00:13:35.243]  But just because the fact...
[00:13:36.324 --> 00:13:37.745]  He's not establishment enough.
[00:13:37.925 --> 00:13:43.930]  You know, he's out there protesting wars and talking about NSA spying and domestic police state and all this other stuff.
[00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.111]  And I don't think the establishment likes that.
[00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:47.292]  He's rocking the boat too much.
[00:13:47.332 --> 00:13:50.614]  He's not in bed with the military-industrial complex.
[00:13:50.675 --> 00:13:52.996]  Because for all these candidates, like, I want to end war.
[00:13:53.056 --> 00:14:02.163]  Just Obama, for example, you know, he criticized Bush and his perpetual war design, you know, going into Iraq and all these other areas over yellow cake lies.
[00:14:02.563 --> 00:14:17.578]  Meanwhile, he's going into Libya, he's going into Syria, Pakistan, Yemen, and he has a technicality that's like, well, I don't so much have boots on the ground, but he has drones in the sky blowing up wedding parties and all that, and that's how these guys skate by on their technicalities.
[00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:28.065]  Now, something that's very interesting to me, people so often say that nobody's coming for your guns, there are no gun restrictions, nobody's trying to limit your access to a firearm.
[00:14:28.145 --> 00:14:29.886]  Well, take note of these stories.
[00:14:30.347 --> 00:14:34.049]  City demands firearm applicants write essay explaining a need for a gun.
[00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:43.915]  Now, notice, they're not kicking in your door and taking your gun, they're not, you know, doing some type of confiscation, but they're saying you will have to convince us of your need for a firearm.
[00:14:44.035 --> 00:14:47.458]  Not because you have a Second Amendment, but you're going to have to explain to us why you need a firearm.
[00:14:48.058 --> 00:14:58.368]  A new policy in a Massachusetts town imposes a burdensome step to residents who want to obtain a license to carry a firearm at essay exam in a $1,000 training seminar.
[00:14:58.989 --> 00:15:06.556]  And the guy says, I will never write an essay to get my rights from the, he says, I will never write an essay to get my rights as an American citizen.
[00:15:06.816 --> 00:15:08.178]  And that was Don Gannon.
[00:15:08.298 --> 00:15:11.261]  And that's something he said during a city council meeting and I do.
[00:15:11.701 --> 00:15:12.822]  I agree with this gentleman here.
[00:15:12.862 --> 00:15:15.545]  You should not have to convince the government to give you your rights.
[00:15:15.565 --> 00:15:18.907]  You should say, hey, I want my rights, and that's pretty much the end of it.
[00:15:19.328 --> 00:15:22.891]  Now, something else for everybody who says there is no such thing as a gun registry.
[00:15:23.351 --> 00:15:25.133]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:15:25.273 --> 00:15:28.556]  It's something that the right wing cooked up to scare you about your gun rights.
[00:15:29.136 --> 00:15:31.378]  California gun seizure program needs money.
[00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:46.271]  California State Department of Justice's Armed and Prohibited Persons System, which uses lists of firearm owners cross-referenced with criminal and mental health records to identify once-legal gun owners who may be in possession of weapons in violation of the law.
[00:15:46.611 --> 00:15:51.195]  Now, regardless if you think this program is a good idea or not, that's not the point I'm trying to make here.
[00:15:51.716 --> 00:15:57.721]  They say there is no list, there is no registry, there is no way to track who or who doesn't have a firearm.
[00:15:59.537 --> 00:16:06.019]  The Armed and Prohibited Persons System, which uses lists, lists, lists of firearm owners.
[00:16:06.339 --> 00:16:08.860]  Now once again, you may think it's good to cross-reference these lists.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.901]  My point that I'm making here is they say there is no list.
[00:16:11.941 --> 00:16:14.481]  There is a list right here on this paper.
[00:16:14.562 --> 00:16:18.743]  This is guns.com, I believe January 26, 2016.
[00:16:19.763 --> 00:16:21.524]  You can go look it up for yourself.
[00:16:21.824 --> 00:16:22.764]  This is just one example.
[00:16:23.144 --> 00:16:27.348]  There's so many other places, like yeah, there is no list of gun owners.
[00:16:27.368 --> 00:16:30.711]  In New York they listed people like they were sex offenders in the newspaper.
[00:16:30.751 --> 00:16:32.252]  Project Veritas is a story about that.
[00:16:32.292 --> 00:16:34.714]  You can go look that up, but of course these lists don't exist.
[00:16:35.234 --> 00:16:37.696]  Now let's talk about something that's pretty stupid.
[00:16:37.716 --> 00:16:38.417]  I'll just call it what it is.
[00:16:38.918 --> 00:16:42.641]  Social justice warriors complained that Martin Luther King was not inclusive enough.
[00:16:43.241 --> 00:16:45.543]  The, you know, advocate of non-violence in
[00:16:46.929 --> 00:16:48.490]  Human rights and liberties and all this stuff.
[00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.370]  Who wrote the I Have a Dream speech.
[00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:54.892]  They say that he's not inclusive enough because he didn't include people like transgenders.
[00:16:55.292 --> 00:16:59.394]  And one of the students was quoted, this is Mia Ashley, diversity is so much more than race.
[00:16:59.894 --> 00:17:01.995]  Obviously, race still plays a big role.
[00:17:02.515 --> 00:17:08.178]  But for people who have, who identify differently in gender and all sorts of things like that, they should be included as well.
[00:17:08.238 --> 00:17:08.718]  So yeah.
[00:17:09.098 --> 00:17:13.180]  And also the quote that they want to take off of MLK, they said the quote,
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:19.264]  That he replaced was previously there and it was removed because it didn't use the word human race.
[00:17:19.324 --> 00:17:21.125]  It referred to the human race as man.
[00:17:21.565 --> 00:17:25.988]  Just more silliness right there and we'll wrap up our segment with this before we go into more special reports.
[00:17:26.649 --> 00:17:30.851]  Many people, big guests on the show today like Robert Tosh Plumlee who flew for the CIA.
[00:17:31.892 --> 00:17:37.298]  Bilderberg Elite, he's saying the global super elite must stop Donald Trump at all costs.
[00:17:37.358 --> 00:17:39.740]  Basically, they're saying that Trump is not establishment enough.
[00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:45.026]  I do agree that Trump is not an establishment candidate, but it doesn't mean I want him to be our next president of the United States.
[00:17:45.386 --> 00:17:46.567]  Well, that's it for this segment.
[00:17:46.587 --> 00:17:50.652]  Stay tuned for more after this, right here on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:17:57.338 --> 00:17:58.380]  I'm running for president.
[00:17:58.781 --> 00:18:01.988]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:18:02.008 --> 00:18:06.397]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.246]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:18:21.386 --> 00:18:29.995]  I went to high school with Shane, his brother, knew his parents well, and he was visiting the office once, hadn't been to the office in years, and said, wow, I notice you're making and selling supplements.
[00:18:30.015 --> 00:18:30.776]  Do these really work?
[00:18:30.816 --> 00:18:35.862]  Because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout enthusiast, and I really think most of them are hype.
[00:18:35.902 --> 00:18:37.403]  And I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:44.048]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in, blown away, and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:45.969]  It's simply amazing.
[00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:47.290]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.854]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:18:52.074 --> 00:18:53.575]  They understand how it all works.
[00:18:53.855 --> 00:18:55.436]  I know that it works for me.
[00:18:55.556 --> 00:18:56.697]  That's all I understand.
[00:18:56.957 --> 00:19:02.001]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:02.021 --> 00:19:03.002]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:04.683]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:14.788]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:19:14.808 --> 00:19:17.329]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:21.551]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:23.873]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.675]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:28.338]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:19:28.879 --> 00:19:31.322]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:35.647]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:19:35.847 --> 00:19:37.509]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:19:37.949 --> 00:19:42.675]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:19:54.972 --> 00:19:56.673]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:19:57.134 --> 00:20:00.616]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:20:00.736 --> 00:20:02.037]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:20:02.237 --> 00:20:04.899]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:11.303]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:17.368]  But over the years and being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.650]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.392]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:20:23.752 --> 00:20:24.112]  We're good to go.
[00:20:42.837 --> 00:20:52.901]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:20:52.921 --> 00:21:05.407]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:07.528]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:21:08.408 --> 00:21:08.929]  I don't know.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.140]  You'll love it.
[00:22:03.064 --> 00:22:12.426]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:21.277 --> 00:22:31.608]  The wave of refugees peppered with ISIS fighters and ISIS sympathizers are invading Europe all according to plan, and with the blessings of European leaders.
[00:22:31.889 --> 00:22:33.410]  Jihads are being waged.
[00:22:33.811 --> 00:22:36.594]  European women are being raped at epidemic levels.
[00:22:36.974 --> 00:22:42.440]  The French city of Calais has become ground zero for the migrant anarchy flooding the rest of Europe.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.725]  And now a wave of 400,000 plus migrants are entering Italy.
[00:22:47.005 --> 00:22:57.257]  But rather than pushing on to Northern Europe, these migrants will remain in Italy as the Schengen Treaty, intended to guarantee open borders, is coming apart at the seams.
[00:22:57.837 --> 00:23:07.375]  Six countries, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Slovenia have suspended the treaty for two years and others appear ready to follow them.
[00:23:07.655 --> 00:23:10.741]  In many respects, Schengen no longer exists.
[00:23:11.314 --> 00:23:19.217]  Italy's Prime Minister has come under fire after ancient nude statues in Rome's Capitolone Museum were covered up during a visit by Iran's President.
[00:23:19.678 --> 00:23:22.699]  And this is exactly what the ISIS leaders had planned.
[00:23:22.879 --> 00:23:31.743]  The conquest of Rome is one of the Islamic State's primary goals as ISIS intends on beheading the Pope on live television in St.
[00:23:31.803 --> 00:23:38.426]  Peter's Square to be followed by mass beheadings of Christians as Rome is converted into a Muslim city.
[00:23:38.686 --> 00:23:41.289]  The ISIS timeline to achieve all this is by 2020.
[00:23:42.451 --> 00:23:46.195]  But Europeans are in a chokehold when it comes to airing their grievances.
[00:23:46.456 --> 00:23:57.129]  Stringent hate speech laws and intimidation are being used to wage war on European citizens simply asking their leaders to stop the invasion for the sake of their families.
[00:23:57.449 --> 00:24:13.079]  A professor who interrupted a speech by German Chancellor Angela Merkel was quickly escorted out of the room and now faces legal action from Merceburg University, which vowed to review his position and take legal action against him for damaging the faculty's reputation.
[00:24:19.164 --> 00:24:31.070]  In October, top security experts warned Merkel that the middle class in Germany is becoming radicalized in response to the migrant influx and that domestic unrest may occur as a result.
[00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:37.474]  The warning was circulated among high-ranking security officials in the federal government, according to the report.
[00:24:37.854 --> 00:24:39.735]  I believe the challenge is huge.
[00:24:40.595 --> 00:24:45.998]  And if a challenge is huge, usually it will trigger fears and concerns.
[00:24:46.358 --> 00:24:47.379]  We'll have to address them.
[00:24:47.964 --> 00:24:55.988]  The German government is also working with Facebook to censor and prosecute people who make anti-migrant statements on social media.
[00:24:56.148 --> 00:25:07.314]  Meanwhile, a Dutch man who tweeted that the country's migrant policy was a bad plan received a home visit from police and was cautioned as to his future conduct.
[00:25:07.714 --> 00:25:21.043]  Under these policies, and the initial half-million-plus Muslims planning routes in Italy, the outlandish 2020 goal of the ISIS conquest of Rome doesn't seem as fantastical as previously thought.
[00:25:21.404 --> 00:25:33.212]  There it is, H-Res 569, condemning violence, bigotry, and hateful rhetoric towards Muslims in the United States, and that is in the House Judiciary, brought forward by... Who's that brought forward by?
[00:25:33.252 --> 00:25:34.193]  Who's the sponsor of that?
[00:25:35.414 --> 00:25:36.414]  A whole bunch of people.
[00:25:36.474 --> 00:25:36.855]  I'll have to...
[00:25:37.915 --> 00:25:38.916]  I'll have to read that for myself.
[00:25:38.936 --> 00:25:39.577]  What does it say?
[00:25:40.358 --> 00:25:46.424]  It's a resolution and it's basically a blatant attack on the First Amendment.
[00:25:56.308 --> 00:25:58.670]  We are joined by Robert Tosh Plumlee on Facebook.
[00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.872]  It's Robert.Plumlee.5.
[00:26:01.992 --> 00:26:05.795]  We'll send that out in a Twitter link for everybody and on Facebook.
[00:26:06.415 --> 00:26:07.876]  He's been censored by Facebook.
[00:26:07.917 --> 00:26:08.817]  He's been harassed.
[00:26:08.857 --> 00:26:10.358]  He's been, you know, subpoenaed.
[00:26:10.538 --> 00:26:12.080]  You name it for what you're about to hear.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.263]  And I don't usually do build-ups like this, but I didn't do a build-up this big when Donald Trump came on.
[00:26:17.043 --> 00:26:18.584]  But this is a big deal.
[00:26:18.684 --> 00:26:25.827]  So he's got a whole stack of news that's since come out confirming what he told us three years ago, two years ago, a year ago, six months ago.
[00:26:26.288 --> 00:26:28.909]  And now he feels a lot safer to say even more.
[00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:31.010]  So let's go to Robert Tosh Plumlee.
[00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.711]  Robert, thank you for coming on, sir.
[00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:38.903]  Well, thank you, Alex, for having me back on, but, wow, who is that guy you're talking about?
[00:26:39.684 --> 00:26:39.964]  Anyway.
[00:26:40.245 --> 00:26:43.227]  Well, he's a guy that's got huevos the size of bowling balls.
[00:26:43.387 --> 00:26:49.833]  Breakdown the latest, Fast and Furious, it's coming out, El Chapo, Benghazi, you've got the floor.
[00:26:49.873 --> 00:26:50.173]  Go ahead.
[00:26:50.974 --> 00:26:53.177]  Okay, well, let me make a qualifier here.
[00:26:53.217 --> 00:26:59.585]  This call may be monitored by federal agencies, and that's about all I can say about that.
[00:27:00.886 --> 00:27:02.668]  Thank you for having me back on, Alex.
[00:27:02.728 --> 00:27:05.111]  I do appreciate it.
[00:27:05.312 --> 00:27:06.433]  I'm winging it as we go.
[00:27:06.493 --> 00:27:07.254]  I don't take notes.
[00:27:09.256 --> 00:27:18.644]  One of the main reasons, if you remember, we talked about Fast and Furious many years ago and made allegations that the U.S.
[00:27:18.704 --> 00:27:28.972]  made weapons, international weapons market, was shipping arms and ammunition to the Mexican army through the direct commercial sales program to Mexico.
[00:27:29.873 --> 00:27:40.521]  Made the allegation at that point in time that Mexico Federal Mexico Army was allowing those guns and ammunition to be pilfered and being sent to the cartel.
[00:27:41.402 --> 00:27:55.273]  What prompted me to get in touch with you and come back on your program was to bring up to date about those armed shipments from Fast and Furious that went to the Mexican Army that was pilfered from the Mexican Army and then went to the Sinaloa cartel.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.321]  And that's El Chapo, who we met last week.
[00:27:58.361 --> 00:28:01.963]  They found in his hideout a .50 caliber Barrett from Fast and Furious.
[00:28:02.603 --> 00:28:13.149]  Right, and they also found .40 caliber anti-aircraft weapons at another location that was attributed back to Joaquin, or Shorty.
[00:28:13.849 --> 00:28:23.514]  But at that point in time, we were talking about, we lost a Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry, and I know you know about that.
[00:28:24.521 --> 00:28:35.309]  And the weapons that were attributed to his murder have recently been found, some of them, in the safe house there at Guzman.
[00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:41.814]  That hit the mainstream media news just very briefly and has been covered up since that time.
[00:28:42.875 --> 00:28:49.100]  That's the reason for me coming back on the show here, to bring attention back to mainstream media.
[00:28:49.881 --> 00:28:52.743]  Dropped that like a hot potato a couple of weeks ago.
[00:28:53.875 --> 00:28:55.816]  ATF has no comments.
[00:28:56.977 --> 00:29:05.523]  Certain various people have made requests for the ATF to produce the serial numbers of those weapons that was found in Guzman's hideaway.
[00:29:06.103 --> 00:29:08.064]  They have, to date, refused to do that.
[00:29:08.705 --> 00:29:09.565]  Comment from the U.S.
[00:29:09.585 --> 00:29:18.431]  State Department in reference to the direct commercial sales program that allowed those weapons to be shipped to the Mexican Army has no comment at this point.
[00:29:19.071 --> 00:29:22.512]  A series of emails were sent at that point in time.
[00:29:23.152 --> 00:29:24.513]  I'm talking about Fast and Furious.
[00:29:25.193 --> 00:29:41.859]  At that point in time, to the State Department, requesting a rundown on the amount of weapons that were shipped through the Blue Lantern Report and Direct Commercial Sales Program, shipped to the Mexican Army.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:49.763]  That is now classified as a top-secret, committee-sensitive investigation.
[00:29:49.844 --> 00:30:04.012]  And just to be clear, since you were first on three-plus years ago, it has come out in the Chicago Tribune and El Paso Times that, indeed, the number two under El Chapo, who was extradited, did bring up that he was working for the DEA and CIA going back for a decade.
[00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:05.053]  It was all sanctioned.
[00:30:05.073 --> 00:30:07.334]  Then it was a war to take out other cartels.
[00:30:07.395 --> 00:30:08.495]  They were being double-crossed.
[00:30:08.895 --> 00:30:09.836]  So that all came out.
[00:30:11.617 --> 00:30:17.140]  I'm going back from memory here, but specifically, what can you say about El Chapo, flights into Mexico?
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.682]  I mean, I think off-record once and on-record, you told me you know El Chapo, correct?
[00:30:23.222 --> 00:30:23.842]  Well, I know.
[00:30:25.003 --> 00:30:25.903]  Yes, okay.
[00:30:26.003 --> 00:30:29.565]  Carl Quintero also was another person to send a mix in this.
[00:30:30.105 --> 00:30:39.349]  And Carl Quintero and Joaquin Guzman were associates at Carl's Ranch in Guadalajara, outside of Guadalajara.
[00:30:41.235 --> 00:30:45.117]  Carl Quintero had a warrant issued for him because of the Kiki Camarena murder.
[00:30:45.137 --> 00:30:47.839]  I'm not going to go into all that kind of stuff because it takes up too much time.
[00:30:48.499 --> 00:30:54.142]  But the lineage is there that, yes, Joaquin Guzman and his family.
[00:30:55.683 --> 00:30:58.024]  I've been privileged to meet him and talk to him.
[00:30:58.425 --> 00:31:00.466]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[00:31:01.346 --> 00:31:02.307]  DEA knows this.
[00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:04.048]  There's a whole complete file on this.
[00:31:04.808 --> 00:31:08.550]  We had undercover operatives working into that operation through the Mexican Army.
[00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:11.072]  I'm not Mexican Army, through the Mexican Marinos.
[00:31:11.892 --> 00:31:15.254]  And that goes back to Attach 47 that was working out of Fort Bliss, Texas.
[00:31:16.214 --> 00:31:27.901]  That was infiltrated into the arms deal about what was going on and guns going across the border into Mexico at that particular time.
[00:31:27.921 --> 00:31:32.183]  Well, I don't want to get to rambling here, but my point being is that
[00:31:32.924 --> 00:31:43.586]  Those allegations that the cartel had US-made weapons involved in an international gunrunning operation that also included guns going to the Middle East, Libya,
[00:31:44.897 --> 00:31:47.098]  Three or four years ago, I think those allegations were made.
[00:31:47.118 --> 00:31:57.562]  And I made a comment that it was a similar operation that's been going on for a number of years, all the way back before I ran Contra, going all the way back to Cuba.
[00:31:58.222 --> 00:32:07.546]  And now it's important because we have the 50 Cal, that's Fox News, AP, but then no other coverage, from the government to El Chapo.
[00:32:08.466 --> 00:32:09.307]  Who's behind it?
[00:32:09.707 --> 00:32:12.149]  Obviously, it's connected to the federal government.
[00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.752]  And why are they burning El Chapo now?
[00:32:15.132 --> 00:32:16.173]  Why are they turning on him?
[00:32:27.139 --> 00:32:36.425]  You guys have the exclusive for which is a product called Deep Cleanse and why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula almost like the iodine crystals.
[00:32:36.505 --> 00:32:40.267]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[00:32:40.647 --> 00:32:52.434]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called Shilajit and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago as a matter of fact this ingredient
[00:32:52.634 --> 00:32:59.038]  Was only given to the elite of the elite thousands of years ago up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet.
[00:32:59.078 --> 00:33:02.901]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:03.301]  Right.
[00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:04.422]  I mean, let's explain.
[00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:07.624]  I mean, this stuff's so good, we couldn't put it out for years.
[00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:16.353]  Right, so I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[00:33:16.793 --> 00:33:26.363]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[00:33:26.384 --> 00:33:27.625]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[00:33:27.665 --> 00:33:28.306]  And they would pick
[00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:31.207]  This black substance from the mountains.
[00:33:31.668 --> 00:33:38.171]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[00:33:38.272 --> 00:33:46.476]  And shilajit is actually the decomposition of seven, up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[00:33:46.536 --> 00:33:53.200]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.483]  And what happens in the summertime... So it's almost like an oil from
[00:33:58.343 --> 00:34:01.046]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[00:34:01.086 --> 00:34:05.411]  Because they're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[00:34:05.972 --> 00:34:10.417]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[00:34:10.818 --> 00:34:14.823]  So this is a true fossil source?
[00:34:14.843 --> 00:34:15.583]  I mean, explain it to me.
[00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:16.624]  It is.
[00:34:17.024 --> 00:34:22.345]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants.
[00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:26.306]  And with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains, it freezes.
[00:34:26.386 --> 00:34:31.327]  And during the summertime and the pressures build it up, it oozes out.
[00:34:31.427 --> 00:34:33.007]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:33.827]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:34.187 --> 00:34:35.188]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:38.348]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[00:34:39.188 --> 00:34:41.809]  Even in the 1980s, when the Olympic
[00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:44.850]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:52.231]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[00:34:52.431 --> 00:34:53.491]  It's a big dose in there.
[00:34:53.511 --> 00:35:03.234]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[00:35:03.694 --> 00:35:08.615]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[00:35:09.415 --> 00:35:17.522]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[00:35:17.563 --> 00:35:21.506]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:27.512]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[00:35:28.132 --> 00:35:36.039]  This formula now and, you know, there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year.
[00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:37.260]  How do people take it?
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.622]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[00:35:39.722 --> 00:35:41.424]  Just a daily dose?
[00:35:41.704 --> 00:35:43.446]  Yeah, daily dose.
[00:35:43.526 --> 00:35:44.907]  The instructions are on the label.
[00:35:44.927 --> 00:35:48.330]  You know, of course, I kind of modify it for each individual.
[00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.931]  It depends on what your lifestyle is.
[00:35:49.971 --> 00:35:55.076]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment.
[00:35:55.376 --> 00:35:55.456]  Yeah.
[00:36:17.495 --> 00:36:18.397]  These aren't just great products.
[00:36:18.417 --> 00:36:20.200]  This is how we fund this independent operation.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:25.431]  We're not taxpayer-funded like MSNBC or NPR, and neither is your local station, so support them, folks.
[00:36:25.631 --> 00:36:26.252]  This is a war.
[00:36:30.998 --> 00:36:37.863]  Joining us now is Robert X. Johnson, and he is someone who has a lot of experience at the grassroots level.
[00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:44.948]  And as you've heard me say many times before, I think we are too caught up with trying to fix things at the very top.
[00:36:45.008 --> 00:36:48.491]  I think we need to understand how to do things at the state level.
[00:36:48.531 --> 00:36:51.113]  We need to understand what our power is with state nullification.
[00:36:51.413 --> 00:36:54.856]  We need to understand what our power is with jury nullification, and we need to understand
[00:36:55.396 --> 00:37:01.338]  What we can do at the local grassroots level to affect electoral reform.
[00:37:01.418 --> 00:37:03.519]  So joining us now is Robert X. Johnson.
[00:37:03.579 --> 00:37:07.981]  He was a former state parliamentarian for the Republican Party back in 1995.
[00:37:08.281 --> 00:37:10.442]  He was a delegate and activist from 1988 to 2010.
[00:37:10.642 --> 00:37:16.725]  He had a stroke in 2011 and he backed out of the heavy activism.
[00:37:17.185 --> 00:37:24.468]  But he's back now to advise us on specifically what we can do at the local level and also to give us kind of a
[00:37:25.248 --> 00:37:28.014]  overview of what we're really trying to do here.
[00:37:28.475 --> 00:37:29.077]  Welcome, Robert.
[00:37:29.698 --> 00:37:29.979]  Thank you.
[00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:42.185]  Give us an idea of where you see this going, and as we talked a little bit before the interview, the bigger picture before we get into some details that people can do at the local level.
[00:37:42.605 --> 00:37:47.627]  In my observations of politics generally, people like to look to the top only.
[00:37:47.807 --> 00:37:54.969]  They want this guy for president, that guy for president, or they look at what can we do with constitutional conventions.
[00:37:55.689 --> 00:37:59.053]  And all of that is fine, but it'll never really work.
[00:37:59.153 --> 00:38:00.274]  It never seems to work.
[00:38:00.454 --> 00:38:08.082]  If you only cry out for a king, or only look at the top, it seems that you're always betrayed just shortly thereafter.
[00:38:08.102 --> 00:38:12.306]  Well, you know, I think the government has gotten so large, so intrusive,
[00:38:13.206 --> 00:38:15.167]  That I don't think any one person can even control it.
[00:38:15.527 --> 00:38:24.150]  We have so many different bureaucracies that are involved at local levels, and of course, at the federal level I should say, that have basically become a law and a little kingdom to themselves.
[00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.212]  It's a difficult thing even for one individual to do that.
[00:38:27.532 --> 00:38:42.678]  And when we put all of our energy into just trying to get a guy elected for president, and if that's the only thing that we're concerned about, we don't pay any attention to what's happening at the local level, where we can have far more leverage, that is a failed strategy, a failed tactic.
[00:38:42.998 --> 00:38:52.375]  And that's kind of why I agreed to come in today is because the strategy of bottom-up is truly essential even if your desire is top-down.
[00:38:52.535 --> 00:38:52.756]  Yeah.
[00:38:52.916 --> 00:38:54.719]  A top-down strategy really won't
[00:38:55.469 --> 00:38:58.890]  Don't bring any fruit until you have a bottom-up strategy to go with it.
[00:38:59.271 --> 00:39:03.492]  We've had the left always say, think globally, act locally.
[00:39:03.892 --> 00:39:06.634]  And I think we need to understand what's going on globally.
[00:39:06.734 --> 00:39:08.494]  We need to understand what's going on nationally.
[00:39:08.794 --> 00:39:14.937]  But we understand that where the rubber meets the road, where you really need to take action if you're going to change things, is at the local level.
[00:39:15.197 --> 00:39:16.338]  That's exactly right.
[00:39:16.438 --> 00:39:20.460]  A lot of people just don't realize it because it seems like it's picky or too small.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:26.283]  But a precinct convention is actually more powerful than Congress and the Senate and the President.
[00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:32.827]  Because the fourth clause of the First Amendment, you got freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press.
[00:39:33.227 --> 00:39:36.069]  Most people don't realize the fourth one, freedom of assembly,
[00:39:36.869 --> 00:39:42.451]  That's what I'm an expert in, is rules.
[00:39:42.851 --> 00:39:51.114]  The rules of a political party are dominant over state law, when appropriate, over state constitutions and even federal law.
[00:39:51.674 --> 00:39:55.195]  Because those rules are literally freedom of assembly.
[00:39:55.675 --> 00:40:07.323]  The Fong case in 1988 and again another case in 2000 the Supreme Court made the ruling clearly a political party is independent of the state's authority to control it.
[00:40:07.623 --> 00:40:12.286]  How can you have freedom of assembly if the state or the federal government is controlling it?
[00:40:12.927 --> 00:40:21.452]  So we take their money in political parties so they get some control but the state has the burden of proving overriding state interest to monkey around.
[00:40:22.513 --> 00:40:36.699]  One example is, for example, we could pass at a party rule level with one or two percent of the population, our voting population, a rule on term limits, and we could term limit out all incumbents they couldn't run in the primary.
[00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:43.622]  That way, because of gerrymandering, you're pretty much going to wipe out all the Republicans, or if you took over their Democrat party, all the Democrats.
[00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:52.618]  Abraham Lincoln was term limited out of office from the Whig Party after one term in Congress because that's what the Whig Party party rules said.
[00:40:52.638 --> 00:40:55.140]  There was no law that required him to leave.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:01.626]  You don't have to go through this entire, this complicated amendment to the Constitution or a constitutional convention.
[00:41:01.666 --> 00:41:03.227]  You can just do it at the party level.
[00:41:03.247 --> 00:41:04.208]  Say, we're going to have term limits.
[00:41:04.228 --> 00:41:04.548]  That's it.
[00:41:04.988 --> 00:41:09.532]  And for like the Rhino problem, you could pass a rule at a state convention
[00:41:10.433 --> 00:41:13.455]  That creates censure, which means punishment.
[00:41:14.055 --> 00:41:15.135]  You know, you're a bad guy.
[00:41:15.956 --> 00:41:16.856]  I think you're a rhino.
[00:41:16.996 --> 00:41:19.498]  You're against the ideals of our platform.
[00:41:19.878 --> 00:41:23.340]  You are now prohibited from running in our party.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:24.280]  That's it.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.020]  They're out of office.
[00:41:25.081 --> 00:41:25.481]  They're done.
[00:41:26.081 --> 00:41:27.362]  It eliminates the rhino problem.
[00:41:27.802 --> 00:41:37.147]  So this gives you the opportunity, with very small numbers, to take over the Congress, the Senate, the State House, the State Senate, the governorships.
[00:41:37.907 --> 00:41:41.612]  Party rules can bring discipline to party platforms.
[00:41:41.672 --> 00:41:44.576]  Right now, a party platform is a meaningless document.
[00:41:44.656 --> 00:41:45.237]  Nobody reads it.
[00:41:45.297 --> 00:41:45.958]  Nobody cares.
[00:41:46.038 --> 00:41:46.418]  That's right.
[00:41:46.579 --> 00:41:52.246]  But just 50 years ago, the first thing you did was say, I agree to support the platform.
[00:41:52.326 --> 00:41:53.588]  Therefore, I'm eligible to run.
[00:41:54.409 --> 00:42:04.596]  There is no system of rules or design of politics that is safe from the conniving activity of liars, cheaters and stealers.
[00:42:04.977 --> 00:42:08.919]  The Bull Moose Party, back then everything was machine run.
[00:42:09.099 --> 00:42:11.461]  And so they changed the rules to make it primary run.
[00:42:12.021 --> 00:42:16.905]  But now primaries are controlled by money and gerrymandering and all kinds of avarice.
[00:42:17.365 --> 00:42:18.866]  So you just keep changing things.
[00:42:19.347 --> 00:42:20.908]  In the Declaration of Independence,
[00:42:22.159 --> 00:42:27.604]  It tells you the purpose of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to secure governments for our people.
[00:42:28.064 --> 00:42:34.410]  But it is the right, it is the duty of the people to change the forms, the rules, so they may secure.
[00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:40.475]  And then at the end of the last sentence of the Declaration of Independence basically says, to this cause we...
[00:42:41.556 --> 00:42:41.976]  We're good to go.
[00:42:58.641 --> 00:43:07.388]  I would think about 65% of the delegates, we can pretty much change the world in as little as one to two elections.
[00:43:07.408 --> 00:43:08.148]  I absolutely agree with you.
[00:43:08.389 --> 00:43:12.652]  I've been involved, not with the Republican Party, but I've been involved with the Libertarian Party back in North Carolina in 1992.
[00:43:14.413 --> 00:43:20.657]  We had a very vibrant party that one year, we had a larger state convention than the Republican Party did.
[00:43:20.977 --> 00:43:26.040]  And I've gone through, I've covered many events, both as a videographer and as a reporter, also as a participant.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.962]  I know just how difficult it is to get people to show up to a political process.
[00:43:29.982 --> 00:43:30.903]  Very few people show up.
[00:43:31.363 --> 00:43:41.086]  I remember going to a political activity where there was nobody there but the candidates, a couple of their representatives, and that was basically it.
[00:43:41.346 --> 00:43:42.907]  Nobody from the public showed up.
[00:43:43.307 --> 00:43:56.291]  So it is a very powerful tool that is just laying there, I think, like jury notification, that if people understood what was there, if they had the knowledge, because they don't have the knowledge or people perish, right?
[00:43:56.451 --> 00:43:56.811]  Exactly.
[00:43:56.831 --> 00:44:00.312]  If they understood the power that is just laying there on the table.
[00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:07.777]  A small number of people, they could come in and they could take over this convention and they could actually restore integrity to the process.
[00:44:08.017 --> 00:44:14.982]  As you pointed out, they could institute things like term limits, censure to get rid of people who violate the principles that are in the party platform.
[00:44:15.002 --> 00:44:19.906]  We fought in the Libertarian Party over every little word in this complicated platform.
[00:44:19.946 --> 00:44:21.727]  I mean, that was a long process.
[00:44:21.747 --> 00:44:23.969]  And then the guys would, you know, agree to that.
[00:44:24.049 --> 00:44:25.350]  If they didn't agree to it, they were out.
[00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:28.792]  I mean, we had, you want to talk about a convention that is
[00:44:29.913 --> 00:44:33.936]  Well, they're talking about with the Republican Convention, the old-style convention we used to have back in the 50s and 60s.
[00:44:34.077 --> 00:44:35.718]  I mean, I saw that.
[00:44:35.758 --> 00:44:37.019]  I was a part of that process.
[00:44:37.339 --> 00:44:41.823]  I know that when it is small like that and you've got activists involved, that can happen.
[00:44:41.863 --> 00:44:42.684]  It still can happen.
[00:44:43.404 --> 00:44:45.406]  Yes, people don't like to waste their time.
[00:44:47.156 --> 00:44:52.224]  The strategists that we have on the national scene today keep talking top down.
[00:44:52.404 --> 00:44:54.607]  They only talk about grandiose ideas.
[00:44:54.687 --> 00:44:57.211]  If everybody follows me, we can save the world.
[00:44:57.331 --> 00:44:57.872]  Well, you know what?
[00:44:58.032 --> 00:44:58.934]  Basically, they're right.
[00:44:58.994 --> 00:45:01.177]  If everybody would follow them, they could save the world.
[00:45:01.738 --> 00:45:02.479]  Unfortunately,
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.121]  People aren't stupid.
[00:45:04.482 --> 00:45:08.267]  They know their ideas coming from the top just really don't work.
[00:45:08.367 --> 00:45:10.690]  And there's a lot of guys saying, follow me, follow me, follow me.
[00:45:11.171 --> 00:45:17.599]  What I'm trying to say is if we give the people a plausible plan to go from the bottom to the top,
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.001]  That's something everybody can get behind.
[00:45:20.021 --> 00:45:21.601]  That's how you get unity.
[00:45:22.362 --> 00:45:27.163]  And without that unity, we are just fighting against, we're always fighting the same battles.
[00:45:27.244 --> 00:45:31.165]  And I think you pointed out in our post interview, corruption is everywhere.
[00:45:31.225 --> 00:45:33.046]  The bad guys are doing their job.
[00:45:33.126 --> 00:45:33.606]  They're bad.
[00:45:34.186 --> 00:45:36.147]  They will cheat at every level.
[00:45:36.607 --> 00:45:43.350]  So we can't teach people, or at least I can't, teach people, let's cheat also and maybe we'll win.
[00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:46.231]  No, the second you go down the dark side, you're on the dark side.
[00:45:46.431 --> 00:45:49.632]  Thank you so much, Robert X. Johnson, former state parliamentarian.
[00:45:49.672 --> 00:45:51.233]  You know what the rules are.
[00:45:51.613 --> 00:45:54.494]  You know that the power is laying there on the table.
[00:45:54.874 --> 00:46:07.579]  It is there for people to use, and it is a shame for us to say we're not going to be bothered in understanding what our rights are as jurors, understanding what our rights are with these assemblies to take back the form of the rule of law.
[00:46:08.779 --> 00:46:14.904]  We need to take back this at the grassroots level, not be completely focused at the top level.
[00:46:14.964 --> 00:46:16.865]  And I think that's a very powerful message.
[00:46:17.165 --> 00:46:18.547]  This is something that we can all do.
[00:46:18.847 --> 00:46:24.971]  We have to understand that just as you have to earn a living for yourself, for your family, you have to earn your freedom.
[00:46:25.332 --> 00:46:26.693]  And there are ways that you can do that.
[00:46:26.773 --> 00:46:29.815]  There is a path, besides the frustration that we all feel.
[00:46:29.855 --> 00:46:34.458]  We see the problems that are there, we understand how this country is coming apart, but there is a path to that.
[00:46:34.478 --> 00:46:35.039]  Thank you so much.

[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:47.026]  Paying it forward and financing and helping so many other people see the truth when we put the videos on Facebook, YouTube, and it's PrisonPlanet.tv that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew.
[00:47:47.426 --> 00:47:48.127]  The Reporters.

[00:48:41.778 --> 00:48:54.728]  Joel Skousen, a former Marine Corps officer, naval aviator from the Vietnam era, of course, best-selling author, researcher, one of the preeminent experts in the world on secure homes, on strategic relocation.
[00:48:54.748 --> 00:48:59.611]  I made a film with him and he has a big book available at InfoWarsStore.com that breaks all that down.
[00:49:00.732 --> 00:49:02.594]  And of course, his uncle was Cleon Skousen.
[00:49:03.744 --> 00:49:10.869]  Who wrote The Naked Communists and started a lot of the libertarian constitutional movement you see by understanding my ultra-rich were funding communism.
[00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:13.051]  And so he joins us now.
[00:49:13.851 --> 00:49:15.553]  I don't like saying see, I told you so.
[00:49:15.573 --> 00:49:23.198]  I got a sick feeling when I got a call last night from Joe Biggs at about 7, 38 o'clock that they had just shot and killed one of them and were calling it a shootout.
[00:49:23.638 --> 00:49:25.240]  I had a suspicion it wasn't a shootout.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.381]  The media ran the headlines it was a shootout even today.
[00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:29.343]  Oregon standoff, militiamen killed.
[00:49:30.063 --> 00:49:38.569]  And now we can put up the new headlines with militiamen on video cameras with guns screaming angrily, you know, it's a bloodbath, an armageddon, we're gonna get you.
[00:49:38.769 --> 00:49:40.970]  I mean, you couldn't script it worse.
[00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:46.854]  To start a civil war, to start a war on patriots, Obama rolling out against the guns.
[00:49:46.994 --> 00:49:51.377]  I mean, if Obama prays his little pillow at night, this is what he's praying for.
[00:49:51.917 --> 00:49:59.742]  And if this is successful, they'll then have attacks on federal buildings, provocateur or staged, to really go to the next phase of oppression.
[00:49:59.962 --> 00:50:00.563]  That's my view.
[00:50:00.583 --> 00:50:02.024]  We'll see what Joel Skousen says.
[00:50:02.364 --> 00:50:03.845]  He had a great plan for him to leave.
[00:50:04.065 --> 00:50:10.289]  The sheriff pretty much took our plan that we sussed out and came to them two days later and said, this is what you should do.
[00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:12.971]  And then that all changed.
[00:50:13.311 --> 00:50:14.812]  So this is now a disaster.
[00:50:15.673 --> 00:50:17.994]  Joel Skousen, do you concur with what I'm saying?
[00:50:18.034 --> 00:50:18.935]  What can you add to it?
[00:50:19.235 --> 00:50:20.636]  What you warned of is now unfolding.
[00:50:22.008 --> 00:50:24.250]  Well, it certainly has, Alex.
[00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:28.513]  I predicted that this wouldn't end well, it would end in a federal shootout.
[00:50:28.893 --> 00:50:40.502]  What is interesting to me, though, is how the feds allowed them, I think they lured them out of the refuge, or Bundy and his group may have showed up at the community meeting last week.
[00:50:41.082 --> 00:50:42.063]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:56.232 --> 00:50:59.173]  And expect not to be arrested was kind of interesting.
[00:50:59.673 --> 00:51:09.878]  The fact that they got away with it the first time allowed them to take on this meeting in John Day with this other public meeting and to address their cause.
[00:51:09.958 --> 00:51:14.540]  And obviously the feds had set them up so that they ambushed them on the way out there.
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:18.141]  They pulled them over, as you've reported, you know, in a car.
[00:51:18.181 --> 00:51:19.602]  And what is really interesting
[00:51:20.322 --> 00:51:20.482]  Yes.
[00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:38.734]  Uh, and tried to evade the shooting, uh, end up crashing.
[00:51:39.274 --> 00:51:41.917]  And then with hands out of the car, they were being shot at again.
[00:51:41.977 --> 00:51:49.465]  So, you know, Finnicum, who's a very mild-mannered, grandfatherly type, well-spoken, um, Mormon.
[00:51:49.545 --> 00:51:51.246]  He's a good religious man.
[00:51:51.266 --> 00:51:54.590]  Uh, it's a shame that he's the one that got shot.
[00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:57.172]  I mean, this guy was taking the higher ground.
[00:51:57.212 --> 00:51:57.272]  He
[00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:03.550]  Uh, you know, there's conflicting reports about what happened when he got out of the car, but clearly he was not armed.
[00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:04.690]  His hands were in the air.
[00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:07.331]  And it's true that he may have been fed up.
[00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:14.093]  You know, one of the witnesses talking to Bundy's bodyguard said that he rushed the officers, but I don't think that's really what happened.
[00:52:14.113 --> 00:52:17.934]  What I think was in his anger saying, look, if you're going to kill me, then go ahead and shoot.
[00:52:17.954 --> 00:52:19.855]  And he was, you know, walking forward to them.
[00:52:20.834 --> 00:52:22.996]  Basically, bearing his chest to them with his hands.
[00:52:23.516 --> 00:52:30.281]  But there's no justification for the police, the FBI, or whoever it was, to shoot him in the head when his hands are in the air.
[00:52:30.341 --> 00:52:32.063]  I don't care if you're walking towards him or even running.
[00:52:32.083 --> 00:52:32.523]  Absolutely.
[00:52:32.563 --> 00:52:47.575]  So, it's going towards murder, leaning towards the fact that the feds have decided to try to provocateur something, because they were able, successfully, because of plants, I think, Joel, to demonize the land rights movement there.
[00:52:49.175 --> 00:52:52.896]  Well, it's clear that they didn't want to Waco in the sense of a siege.
[00:52:53.216 --> 00:52:57.217]  They could have besieged that refuge weeks earlier.
[00:52:57.237 --> 00:53:01.658]  They could have cut off all contact and they could have cut off any food supplies, but they didn't.
[00:53:02.639 --> 00:53:09.161]  I think what they really wanted to do is to portray that this was a shootout with the militia, which it was not a shootout.
[00:53:10.101 --> 00:53:13.562]  There was no guns fired from the car whatsoever.
[00:53:13.642 --> 00:53:17.503]  There was no guns raised to defend themselves, only hands out the window.
[00:53:18.183 --> 00:53:22.454]  And what's interesting here is that there are now six witnesses to this murder.
[00:53:23.524 --> 00:53:31.627]  And although there are going to be defendants in their own trials and things, we have six credible witnesses that he was shot with his hands up.
[00:53:32.267 --> 00:53:35.608]  The governor should order the state police to release their squad car videos.
[00:53:35.668 --> 00:53:36.848]  I don't expect the feds to.
[00:53:37.249 --> 00:53:41.930]  But if they don't instantly release these, it shows the six witnesses are telling the truth.
[00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:44.771]  Do you think it's a mishap by whoever shot him?
[00:53:44.911 --> 00:53:46.612]  Or do you think this is part of a larger plan?
[00:53:47.092 --> 00:53:48.432]  This is part of a larger plan.
[00:53:48.492 --> 00:53:49.553]  They had to go in there.
[00:53:51.073 --> 00:53:55.357]  Trigger happy wanting to take these people down and they did so.
[00:53:55.457 --> 00:54:02.984]  In fact, the fact that they peppered this car with bullets with people's hands up where they had to grasp around and find some kind of white flag.
[00:54:03.584 --> 00:54:07.428]  I mean, one way might have been planning to kill them all and set them up in a shootout.
[00:54:08.871 --> 00:54:15.076]  You know, clearly when you shoot that many bullets into a car, you're intending to kill everybody in the car.
[00:54:15.376 --> 00:54:17.038]  And that's simply unwarranted.
[00:54:17.158 --> 00:54:19.140]  I don't care if there's weapons in the car.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.881]  The point is... I totally agree, Joel.
[00:54:20.921 --> 00:54:23.523]  You're a smart guy, and that's why we've got you here.
[00:54:23.924 --> 00:54:25.305]  What do you think the big picture is?
[00:54:25.325 --> 00:54:27.567]  Do you agree that they walked into a trap?
[00:54:27.887 --> 00:54:32.571]  What do we do now to get those people inside the refuge out who are running around saying they're going to fight to the end?
[00:54:32.611 --> 00:54:34.212]  I mean, this is deteriorating quickly.
[00:54:34.232 --> 00:54:34.552]  Do you agree?
[00:54:35.558 --> 00:54:37.719]  Absolutely, and it's foolish to fight to the end.
[00:54:37.739 --> 00:54:45.362]  I mean, clearly they need to defuse this situation as we have encouraged them to do from the very beginning and live to fight another day.
[00:54:45.823 --> 00:54:54.306]  What I say is you need to figure out another Hammond, someone who's being oppressed by the BLM, who's got a clear case like the Bundys had on their ranch in Nevada.
[00:54:54.346 --> 00:54:59.369]  Shouldn't they just leave now and go directly unarmed to the police department, get out and lay on the ground?
[00:54:59.609 --> 00:55:04.191]  Because I think if they've gone this far, they may kill more people that come out if they catch them out on the road somewhere.
[00:55:05.233 --> 00:55:10.477]  Well, I only disagree in the sense that I don't think that the Feds want to create another Waco there.
[00:55:10.537 --> 00:55:22.286]  They've already got a murder charge being aired about in the internet, which is enlivening these things, and that may well have been why they shot one, to see if they can't throw the militia movement into a
[00:55:24.608 --> 00:55:26.390]  You know, an armed conflict with the nation.
[00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:27.851]  I don't think it's going to go to civil war.
[00:55:27.871 --> 00:55:28.972]  I don't think it's going to get better.
[00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:29.332]  No, I agree.
[00:55:29.352 --> 00:55:35.738]  I agree it's not going to go to civil war, but it creates the narrative for the background for in the future to persecute the patriots.
[00:55:36.724 --> 00:55:37.625]  Yes, it certainly does.
[00:55:38.045 --> 00:55:46.630]  And it makes it almost impossible now to do an Ammon Bundy-style standoff, even in defense of someone like the Hammonds.
[00:55:46.711 --> 00:55:52.374]  When you go in armed and everything, now everyone's going to be primed to say, yeah, take them down, put the feds in.
[00:55:52.774 --> 00:55:54.636]  They're going to have to cover up this murder, though.
[00:55:55.336 --> 00:55:56.236]  And I think they will.
[00:55:56.356 --> 00:56:00.538]  I think they'll sequester the dash cam videos if there were any there.
[00:56:01.018 --> 00:56:02.599]  They won't allow them to be shown.
[00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:04.779]  They'll be sealed in court testimony.
[00:56:04.879 --> 00:56:06.600]  It will be their word against mine.
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:10.341]  And I'll predict they're going to let the federal authorities off scot-free.
[00:56:10.602 --> 00:56:13.182]  This will enliven the movement and enrage it.
[00:56:14.183 --> 00:56:19.645]  But I clearly don't think, because Bundy lost the high ground by staying too long,
[00:56:21.225 --> 00:56:22.326]  And it ended up poorly.
[00:56:23.406 --> 00:56:26.027]  It's going to enliven a certain portion of the movement.
[00:56:26.047 --> 00:56:30.129]  But I was afraid that there were some agent provocateurs there within the refuge.
[00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:36.672]  They seem to know everywhere about their planned movements to set up this trap going to John Day.
[00:56:36.712 --> 00:56:40.193]  In fact, the meeting may have been organized in order to lure them out again.
[00:56:40.213 --> 00:56:44.415]  Joel Scowls, an editor of WorldAffairsBrief.com is our guest.
[00:56:44.475 --> 00:56:45.756]  I'm Alex Jones who just joined us.
[00:56:47.554 --> 00:56:51.820]  The whole thing stinks to high heaven, Joel, and you look at what else is happening in the world.
[00:56:52.261 --> 00:56:54.444]  Joel Skousen, World Affairs Brief, the editor.
[00:56:55.265 --> 00:56:56.547]  What are we facing right now?
[00:56:56.567 --> 00:57:02.135]  This is a gestalt with Hillary election, Trump saying he won't be in the debate, things like that.
[00:57:03.393 --> 00:57:08.316]  Well, I think Trump, first of all, made a very wise strategic move by evading the debate.
[00:57:08.436 --> 00:57:11.318]  It wasn't really the Megyn Kelly thing that he was evading.
[00:57:12.139 --> 00:57:14.721]  It was the Muslim trap that they had set up.
[00:57:14.781 --> 00:57:25.348]  They had two or three, you know, immigrants, one Muslim, one Hispanic, ready and primed to ask him embarrassing questions to try to focus on that issue.
[00:57:25.648 --> 00:57:28.170]  And they were setting up a major trap for him.
[00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:30.151]  And now everybody will talk about him instead.
[00:57:30.191 --> 00:57:33.053]  He'll end up getting more viewers than the debate going everywhere else.
[00:57:33.773 --> 00:57:34.674]  Absolutely.
[00:57:34.994 --> 00:57:36.595]  It's always a win-win situation.
[00:57:36.635 --> 00:57:40.557]  Trump's actually showing quite a bit of political finesse despite the way he speaks.
[00:57:41.317 --> 00:57:44.759]  I'm surprised that he is able to keep them churning.
[00:57:46.099 --> 00:57:47.820]  Well, he does dumb down his speech.
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:49.141]  I mean, he's super smart.
[00:57:49.201 --> 00:57:51.462]  I mean, he's doing that to be more populist.
[00:57:51.882 --> 00:57:52.503]  It's surprising.
[00:57:53.379 --> 00:58:02.184]  Yeah, he did make a major error, I thought, when he talked about, yeah, I can deal with Pelosi, I can deal with Schumer, I can deal with McConnell, all these people, no problem at all.
[00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:06.907]  That's really not the kind of message that conservatives... Sure, they can say that that means he's being establishment.
[00:58:07.427 --> 00:58:07.587]  Yeah.
[00:58:08.048 --> 00:58:10.609]  Now, I don't think he is controlled by the establishment.
[00:58:10.769 --> 00:58:13.091]  I mean, he just simply can't stick to a script.
[00:58:13.151 --> 00:58:15.252]  Nobody who's controlled would act that way.
[00:58:16.132 --> 00:58:20.095]  But nevertheless, it's very clear when they trot out Ben Sasse,
[00:58:20.655 --> 00:58:25.497]  The very popular senator from Nebraska now to take on the anti-Trump movement.
[00:58:25.557 --> 00:58:29.539]  He's going from campaign to campaign in Iowa, talking down Trump.
[00:58:31.199 --> 00:58:32.400]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.

[00:59:03.993 --> 00:59:13.158]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:15.320]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.761]  It's the same price
[00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:23.364]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:59:23.904 --> 00:59:30.148]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:59:30.648 --> 00:59:30.768]  It's $19.95.
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:33.830]  You take one or two of these,
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.213]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:59:38.554 --> 00:59:42.477]  It's what I've experienced and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
