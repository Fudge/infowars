[00:00:19.645 --> 00:00:21.590]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:22.974]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:26.824]  It is March 4th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:30.182 --> 00:00:40.845]  Tonight, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich says the establishment is scared of Donald Trump because he didn't belong to the secret society.
[00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:42.046]  He's an outsider.
[00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:42.666]  He's not them.
[00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:43.806]  He's not part of the club.
[00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:46.047]  He's uncontrollable.
[00:00:46.407 --> 00:00:48.267]  He hasn't been through the initiation rites.
[00:00:48.307 --> 00:00:49.928]  He didn't belong to the secret society.
[00:00:50.128 --> 00:00:59.332]  But then, El Chapo wants to be extradited immediately because his living conditions at a maximum security prison are unbearable.
[00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:04.634]  Plus, Smith and Wesson reports a huge jump in handgun sales.
[00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:08.636]  And they're not shy about thanking Obama for it.
[00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:12.618]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:12.898 --> 00:01:14.680]  We have got to fight and stand up.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.086]  It's not going to be easy, but I'll assure you this, we can and we will and we must prevail!

[00:03:04.025 --> 00:03:08.749]  If you missed last night's debate, you honestly didn't miss much in terms of intelligent conversation.
[00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.658]  It was a concerted effort by Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and I guess their compatriot in this Fox News to dogpile on top of Donald Trump.
[00:03:17.678 --> 00:03:18.538]  And I don't even like Trump.
[00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:19.900]  I've said that personally many times.
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.501]  I have no intention of voting for the man.
[00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:22.782]  I'm going to vote for John McAfee.
[00:03:23.143 --> 00:03:27.427]  But regardless, just the way they keep attacking this guy is just completely ridiculous.
[00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:28.448]  I don't know.
[00:03:46.587 --> 00:03:57.935]  You know, even when Jeb Bush was attacking Marco Rubio on his statue saying, you know, Marco Rubio is too short to be president or, you know, he has to wear these, you know, push-up shoes or, you know, high-heeled boots or whatever he had on.
[00:03:58.436 --> 00:04:05.361]  I'm not a Marco Rubio fan either, but that type of petty, childish attack does not need to be in a presidential debate.
[00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:08.703]  It does definitely not need to come from a presidential contender.
[00:04:09.104 --> 00:04:10.305]  I think a high school
[00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:16.911]  Student council debate could have went better than what we saw last night from all these people involved in it.
[00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:18.852]  It was a truly pathetic deal.
[00:04:19.213 --> 00:04:30.162]  And I just think about, you know, Kim Jong-un or Putin or, you know, any other foreign leader looking at this stuff like, look at these clowns on national TV poking fun at each other for the stupidest stuff imaginable.
[00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:33.546]  I'm sick of watching these debates because of reasons like this.
[00:04:33.946 --> 00:04:36.028]  And if you don't tune into the next one, I honestly couldn't blame you.
[00:04:36.408 --> 00:04:38.650]  Because it's not anything there.
[00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:46.276]  And normally when we look at debates, we always talk about how these guys have these talking points about, you know, we're going to fix roads, we're going to, you know, build jobs and schools and all this stuff.
[00:04:46.696 --> 00:04:47.637]  All the normal stuff.
[00:04:47.757 --> 00:04:48.577]  It wasn't even that.
[00:04:48.697 --> 00:04:52.921]  It was just stupid, just incoherent nonsense.
[00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:58.105]  It was more of a, like a celebrity reality show, like Survivor or something.
[00:04:58.145 --> 00:04:59.446]  But, you know, instead of, you know,
[00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:02.588]  Making fire with sticks there, throwing insults at each other.
[00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:04.910]  So that's pretty much all I'm going to say about the debate.
[00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.852]  I have some presidential news.
[00:05:07.252 --> 00:05:14.058]  We will have some debate highlights going on later on, but you know, consider this, out of three hours of content, we can only come up with like 10 minutes of it.
[00:05:14.078 --> 00:05:16.620]  That shows you how bad this whole thing was.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.021]  But now let's talk about Romney.
[00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:23.746]  Mitt Romney has come out and he's once again attacking Trump or another one of the people who is attacking Trump.
[00:05:24.046 --> 00:05:25.887]  And he's saying he's not even going to run for president.
[00:05:26.168 --> 00:05:28.750]  He just wanted to throw his hat into the ring to attack
[00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:37.180]  Trump saying that he's a horrible businessman, blah, blah, blah, even though you can see a clip from Romney back when he was running, I guess, for president against Obama.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.784]  He's like, you know, I want a Donald Trump endorsement.
[00:05:39.804 --> 00:05:40.885]  Donald Trump's a great guy.
[00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:44.470]  He created all these jobs, you know, completely contradicting the things that he said.
[00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.851]  Just a few days ago, you know, back when he needed the Trump endorsement many moons ago.
[00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:53.432]  But that just shows you how, you know, pathetic this political race is.
[00:05:53.873 --> 00:06:03.335]  And Newt Gingrich, of all people, once again, I'm not a Newt Gingrich fan, but he said the reason people are so afraid of Donald Trump is because he's not in the Billionaire Boys Club.
[00:06:03.595 --> 00:06:05.756]  He doesn't join in their secret societies.
[00:06:07.096 --> 00:06:11.557]  And now they're faced with a very real prospect of Donald Trump becoming the leader of the party.
[00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.378]  And it absolutely drives him crazy.
[00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:15.655]  They just cannot imagine sharing.
[00:06:15.995 --> 00:06:16.075]  Why?
[00:06:16.095 --> 00:06:17.516]  Well, because he's an outsider.
[00:06:17.556 --> 00:06:18.156]  He's not them.
[00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:19.277]  He's not part of the club.
[00:06:19.717 --> 00:06:20.757]  He's uncontrollable.
[00:06:20.777 --> 00:06:23.779]  You know, he hasn't been through the initiation rites.
[00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.480]  He didn't belong to the secret society.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.281]  And I think that they don't see him.
[00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:30.662]  They have no idea how to relate to him.
[00:06:31.536 --> 00:06:35.598]  Now in other news, we've seen a lot of rhetoric, a lot of attacks on the Second Amendment.
[00:06:36.078 --> 00:06:42.041]  People saying we need to infringe the Second Amendment, which says very clearly that it should not be infringed.
[00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:49.424]  And now with all this infringing going on, groups like Smith & Wesson are reporting record sales when it comes to their firearms.
[00:06:49.444 --> 00:06:55.867]  And we see intense political rhetoric around gun control may have unintentionally boosted gun sales further.
[00:06:56.227 --> 00:07:09.812]  And this is always something that I thought, I sometimes think that, you know, Feinstein and Obama or whoever else secretly have stock in firearms because they have to know every time they come out here and bash the Second Amendment that people go out and buy firearms.
[00:07:10.152 --> 00:07:12.012]  And we see third quarter revenues rose 61%.
[00:07:13.573 --> 00:07:20.256]  Year over year to $211 million, boosted by a 25.3% jump in handgun sales.
[00:07:20.597 --> 00:07:26.840]  So yeah, I'm really starting to think there may be something going on behind the curtain on this one.
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:39.306]  I just can't foresee these guys not understanding every time they want to pass a new law, new bill, we're going to embargo AK-47s or ammunition or whatever it is this week, that these things do not break record sales.
[00:07:39.666 --> 00:07:40.827]  Now let's talk about something else.
[00:07:40.887 --> 00:07:42.268]  When we talk about El Chapo.
[00:07:42.788 --> 00:07:45.570]  You guys know El Chapo, the drug kingpin from Mexico.
[00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:49.714]  And this is kind of my sign of the times thing for this episode.
[00:07:50.234 --> 00:07:54.298]  El Chapo claims unbearable conditions and calls for extradition ASAP.
[00:07:54.658 --> 00:08:03.385]  So basically a drug kingpin who has been involved in murders, trafficking, all types of dirty shenanigans is complaining about the
[00:08:04.466 --> 00:08:06.107]  Accommodations in his cell.
[00:08:06.508 --> 00:08:08.809]  He's saying that, hey, it's just too dirty here.
[00:08:08.829 --> 00:08:09.550]  It's too nasty.
[00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.230]  I can't sleep.
[00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.051]  It's all this and that.
[00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:17.455]  I'm like, really, man, with all the stuff you have on you, you're going to complain about conditions in the Mexican jail.
[00:08:17.475 --> 00:08:19.196]  Now you want to be extradited to the U.S.
[00:08:19.497 --> 00:08:20.798]  so you can live in American jail.
[00:08:20.838 --> 00:08:26.862]  And I guess that's something to say about it, that American jails are that much better than Mexican jails.
[00:08:27.042 --> 00:08:31.986]  I feel sorry for the people who are blocked up in, you know, for these nonviolent offenses.
[00:08:32.006 --> 00:08:33.847]  But El Chapo, bro, I don't have too much
[00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:35.133]  Yeah, we're good.
[00:08:35.153 --> 00:08:35.897]  We're good.
[00:08:37.048 --> 00:08:42.691]  I do have a little bit of sympathy for Apple, because we've seen Apple come out and they say, hey, we're not going to hack these phones for the FBI.
[00:08:42.751 --> 00:08:51.116]  Once again, as I always say, the Apple company has been in cahoots, according to Edward Snowden, with the Prism scandal.
[00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:52.477]  So you take all this for what it's worth.
[00:08:52.577 --> 00:08:55.278]  But they're saying we're not going to open the phones for the FBI.
[00:08:55.638 --> 00:08:59.781]  And now we see Amazon is quietly removing encryption from their gadgets.
[00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:05.724]  And they're saying that, hey, basically, FBI, if anybody, if you want to look in on our customers' data, you can go ahead and do it.
[00:09:06.104 --> 00:09:12.305]  And they say, with the changes, users who had encryption on their FHIR devices are left with two bad choices.
[00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:21.648]  Either decline to install the update or leaving their devices with outdated software or give up and keep their data unencrypted.
[00:09:21.668 --> 00:09:31.050]  So basically, you can have an old operating system or you can get the new one and have the ability or give people the ability to just hack into your phone anytime they want, regardless of how
[00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.611]  Legitimate, the claims that may be.
[00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:37.072]  Now as I say with the Apple deal, you know, it's an act of terrorism.
[00:09:37.092 --> 00:09:41.014]  You can say maybe they should make an exception in this case and I would understand that point of view.
[00:09:41.395 --> 00:09:48.038]  But also, you know, we see times when people get pulled over and the officers just want to look through their phones like bro, you pulled me over for a busted taillight.
[00:09:48.058 --> 00:09:49.058]  Why do you want to look at my phone?
[00:09:49.319 --> 00:09:52.080]  Why do you want to see who I'm talking to on Instagram and all this other stuff?
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.921]  So that's just one of the things that's going on.
[00:09:54.321 --> 00:10:02.268]  Now before we go on to more special reports, we have a special report from David Knight and our editor Rob Jacobson talking about the Bundy family situation.
[00:10:02.548 --> 00:10:05.490]  Another one of the family members has gotten into some hot water.
[00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.312]  Let's talk quickly about the TSA.
[00:10:07.772 --> 00:10:12.356]  We see lines at TSA checkpoints getting longer, waits will get worse.
[00:10:12.836 --> 00:10:17.240]  And they're saying basically you can blame the longer lines on reduced staffing from federal budget cuts.
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:33.375]  No, let's blame the TSA lines on the fact that you have to go take out your laptop, you have to take off your shoes, you have to take off your belt, you have to wait in line to get in this x-ray scanner that, you know, look at all your neckage, or you can go stand over here on the side of the x-ray scanner waiting for some guy to come and pat you down.
[00:10:33.395 --> 00:10:34.576]  They're looking through your stuff.
[00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:41.563]  I mean, I swear to goodness, I went to TSA one time, a guy opened my bag, opened my tin of Altoids, shook it around and put it back in the bag.
[00:10:41.883 --> 00:10:44.725]  That's why you have long lines at the TSA, that type of incompetence.
[00:10:45.005 --> 00:10:49.648]  Now let's go on to the special report from David Knight, and we'll be back right after that with more special reports.
[00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.231]  The BLM is back in the news again.
[00:10:53.551 --> 00:11:04.418]  This time we hear from a sheriff in Utah who said he'll deputize the entire county, every man, woman, and child if he has to, in order to defend the land rights of local citizens from an occupying federal army.
[00:11:04.438 --> 00:11:06.600]  Did you hear that phrase, Posse Comitatus?
[00:11:08.246 --> 00:11:17.492]  And typically we think of the Posse Comitatus Act, which is an act that limits the power of the federal government to use the federal military to enact domestic policy.
[00:11:17.612 --> 00:11:18.172]  Think about that.
[00:11:18.653 --> 00:11:24.016]  We don't want a military coming into our communities.
[00:11:24.616 --> 00:11:25.757]  We don't want soldiers.
[00:11:25.797 --> 00:11:27.278]  We don't want martial law.
[00:11:27.438 --> 00:11:30.440]  Okay, that's why we have the Posse Comitatus Act.
[00:11:31.301 --> 00:11:33.502]  But what does Posse Comitatus really mean?
[00:11:33.562 --> 00:11:36.384]  It literally means the power of the county.
[00:11:37.813 --> 00:11:40.894]  The sheriff of the county would call a posse.
[00:11:40.914 --> 00:11:42.334]  We've all seen the Westerns, right?
[00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:59.859]  You have the sheriff who was elected, not appointed by some kind of law enforcement bureaucracy, not appointed by some distant federal government that is as far distant geographically as the British government was geographically from the American colonies at the time of the Revolutionary War.
[00:12:00.836 --> 00:12:06.204]  So law enforcement was centered around one elected official and some of his permanent deputies.
[00:12:06.724 --> 00:12:14.636]  But when something big would happen, they would deputize people and they would create a posse to keep the peace in the county.
[00:12:15.056 --> 00:12:16.598]  We're not taking no more cats on the mountain.
[00:12:17.766 --> 00:12:21.408]  I'll deputize every man, woman, and child in that county to stop what's going on.
[00:12:21.708 --> 00:12:30.052]  So how did we get to the situation where the federal government is bullying local citizens to the point where a sheriff has to threaten to deputize the entire county?
[00:12:30.572 --> 00:12:38.616]  As a recent article from High County News has pointed out, this is a result of an arms race by the BLM, an arms race on the range.
[00:12:39.156 --> 00:12:42.338]  Until 1978, there were no badged BLM agents.
[00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.079]  At first, there were only 13.
[00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:49.123]  They modeled themselves after Park Service Rangers and carried only pistols.
[00:12:49.543 --> 00:12:56.888]  Two years earlier, there had been a Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976 that granted law enforcement authority to the agency.
[00:12:57.229 --> 00:13:01.592]  But it also emphasized that they rely upon local law enforcement.
[00:13:01.852 --> 00:13:04.054]  And at first, they cooperated with county sheriffs.
[00:13:04.574 --> 00:13:08.277]  But within just a few years, they were seeing heavily armed agents.
[00:13:08.897 --> 00:13:14.241]  Chris Hartman, who was hired as a ranger in 1984, recalls a series of controversial equipment upgrades.
[00:13:14.541 --> 00:13:20.606]  Shotguns in the 80s, semi-automatic rifles in 1992, high-powered assault rifles in the early 2000s.
[00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:25.610]  Then she left the BLM for the Forest Service, and she saw the same pattern happening there.
[00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:29.212]  But she said, still, the sheriffs were ahead of us in terms of weaponry.
[00:13:29.633 --> 00:13:33.756]  Is this some kind of an arms race between local law enforcement and federal agents?
[00:13:34.236 --> 00:13:43.081]  In 1996 alone, at least 2,439 new federal cops were authorized to carry firearms.
[00:13:43.702 --> 00:13:45.583]  That takes the total up to nearly 60,000.
[00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:54.888]  Farrah points out that these cops were not only in agencies like the FBI, but include the EPA, the U.S.
[00:13:54.948 --> 00:13:57.930]  Fish and Wildlife, the Army Corps of Engineers.
[00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:04.034]  Even Bruce Babbitt, according to FARA, wants to arm the Bureau of Land Management.
[00:14:04.335 --> 00:14:11.060]  FARA logically asks, when will the NEA have its armed art cops?
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:23.790]  We have to understand that whenever the federal government starts arming itself with high-powered military equipment, they are turning themselves into a standing army, and they will use this against the citizens.
[00:14:24.318 --> 00:14:27.920]  As elsewhere in law enforcement, 9-11 changed things.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.301]  It created a restructuring.
[00:14:29.521 --> 00:14:34.484]  Former BLM director Bob Abbey said it created a faction within the agency.
[00:14:34.685 --> 00:14:38.447]  And he said, I think in many respects they have become a separate organization.
[00:14:38.727 --> 00:14:43.350]  So-called special agents in charge were given autonomy over large regions.
[00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:44.231]  We're good to go.
[00:14:59.147 --> 00:14:59.747]  Going back to 2009.
[00:15:01.028 --> 00:15:10.013]  In that case, a doctor who was very beloved to the small community that he served, was accused of taking an Indian artifact from the land that the federal government claims belongs to them.
[00:15:10.233 --> 00:15:13.655]  The item in question was a bead, less than half the size of a dime.
[00:15:13.855 --> 00:15:21.760]  The wrongful death complaint by the doctor's family said the BLM agent, Love, had doubled the value of the item, so the charge would rise to that of a felony.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.222]  And they also said this was retaliation for dismissal of similar charges more than a decade earlier.
[00:15:27.562 --> 00:15:31.744]  In Utah, the doctor had been accused by a confidential federal informant.
[00:15:31.944 --> 00:15:37.126]  The 60-year-old doctor was swarmed by between 80 and 100 agents in full military array.
[00:15:37.286 --> 00:15:38.747]  Flak jackets, assault weapons.
[00:15:38.967 --> 00:15:43.949]  He was manhandled, handcuffed, as he returned home from serving in the community health clinic that he ran.
[00:15:44.249 --> 00:15:47.590]  He was taken to his garage, interrogated for four hours like a terrorist.
[00:15:47.891 --> 00:15:49.931]  He was told that he would lose his medical license.
[00:15:50.292 --> 00:15:53.753]  And Agent Love accused him of using garden tools to dig up bodies.
[00:15:54.273 --> 00:15:57.795]  The doctor was so distraught by these charges that he committed suicide.
[00:15:58.155 --> 00:16:01.476]  The family brought a wrongful death lawsuit against the BLM.
[00:16:01.636 --> 00:16:05.098]  The BLM argued that agents have qualified immunity.
[00:16:05.678 --> 00:16:15.926]  And a judge eventually dismissed the case, saying, Yet the basis for the charges against Cliven Bundy regarding the Bunkerville standoff are that he incited people to carry firearms legally, and that the brandishing of firearms alone was a felony threat to federal officers.
[00:16:32.657 --> 00:16:35.440]  So what we have here are a set of two different rules.
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.945]  One set for protesters, a completely different set for federal officers.
[00:16:40.506 --> 00:16:41.807]  The hallmark of tyranny.
[00:16:42.148 --> 00:16:49.996]  But as we're reminded with the recent indictment of Cliven Bundy, special agent in charge, Dan Love, was the center of the Bunkerville standoff.
[00:16:50.137 --> 00:16:52.960]  Now even the Clark County Sheriff, Doug Gillespie,
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:17:01.883]  Friend of Harry Reid said in interviews with Las Vegas newspapers at the beginning of February that the BLM had lied to him about circumstances of the cattle roundup.
[00:17:02.183 --> 00:17:20.328]  Another BLM special agent in charge, Steve Martin, who serves in a different jurisdiction, recalls sitting in the briefing room of Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, listening to the details of a clandestine operation that his agency was planning in the Nevada desert, which would eventually become the Cliven Bundy cattle operation.
[00:17:20.828 --> 00:17:24.632]  He characterized the plan as unduly optimistic bravado.
[00:17:25.112 --> 00:17:28.795]  And he said, I remember thinking, is this still the BLM?
[00:17:29.276 --> 00:17:31.858]  He said, we know there are a lot of people out there who don't like us.
[00:17:32.299 --> 00:17:41.767]  And he believes things would not have come to the kind of head that they did if the BLM had worked with and through the local sheriff, instead of lying to him about what was going on.
[00:17:42.328 --> 00:17:42.808]  But they didn't.
[00:17:42.988 --> 00:17:44.390]  They acted confrontationally.
[00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:45.451]  High-handed.
[00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:51.937]  And now, after two years, they have made good on their vendetta and arrested Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy.
[00:17:52.257 --> 00:17:56.561]  Garfield County Sheriff Danny Perkins has said, we have absolutely no relationship with the BLM.
[00:17:56.902 --> 00:17:57.422]  We've tried.
[00:17:57.502 --> 00:17:59.084]  They seem to want to do their own things.
[00:17:59.124 --> 00:18:01.546]  They do not respect the authority of the sheriff at all.
[00:18:01.927 --> 00:18:02.788]  Another county sheriff.
[00:18:03.388 --> 00:18:09.471]  Rick Eldridge says that rangers pull over citizens without probable cause, even in areas where they have no jurisdiction.
[00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:10.592]  They bully ranch hands.
[00:18:10.712 --> 00:18:13.734]  They berate tourists for parking vehicles off dirt roads.
[00:18:14.254 --> 00:18:16.015]  And they illegally close roads.
[00:18:16.375 --> 00:18:18.916]  Federal officers refuse to help with search and rescue.
[00:18:19.096 --> 00:18:21.077]  When they do, they get in the way, he says.
[00:18:21.358 --> 00:18:27.541]  So this is what brings us to the point where Paiute County Sheriff Marty Gleave says we're not taking it anymore.
[00:18:28.001 --> 00:18:33.185]  I'll deputize every man, woman, and child in the county to stop what's going on.
[00:18:33.886 --> 00:18:37.509]  I'll deputize every man, woman, and child in the county to stop what's going on.
[00:18:37.829 --> 00:18:39.790]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:18:49.157 --> 00:18:49.718]  There he goes!
[00:18:49.878 --> 00:18:51.160]  He's going for it!
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.002]  Yeah!
[00:18:53.062 --> 00:18:55.906]  He's in town, he's in town.
[00:18:55.946 --> 00:18:57.668]  This guy can't elite anything.
[00:19:02.705 --> 00:19:06.127]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:19:06.468 --> 00:19:13.612]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:19:14.213 --> 00:19:22.598]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:19:22.839 --> 00:19:26.941]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:19:27.261 --> 00:19:32.585]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:32.845]  Let's do it!

[00:23:05.168 --> 00:23:20.118]  I'm known for doing a lot of gun reports, a lot of police brutality reports, and while those things are important, there's another topic out there that I think is equally important, if not more so, but I don't get to address it all that much, and that is human trafficking, modern day slavery.
[00:23:20.678 --> 00:23:24.461]  And you see this a lot, you know, in American culture, we usually think about it
[00:23:24.901 --> 00:23:25.161]  I think so.
[00:23:42.719 --> 00:23:50.344]  And as we're talking about the people who are perpetrating these things, sometimes they're not always as hard and fast, cut and dry as they seem.
[00:23:50.704 --> 00:23:52.145]  And we see this with our first article.
[00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:56.688]  Appeals Court Blasts Somali Gang Sex Trafficking Case.
[00:23:56.728 --> 00:24:06.235]  And this is basically an issue where a federal court of appeals in Nashville decided to overturn convictions of three men in a widespread conspiracy case.
[00:24:06.795 --> 00:24:07.196]  That's right.
[00:24:26.738 --> 00:24:28.139]  As they were led to believe.
[00:24:28.219 --> 00:24:31.000]  And as we always know, not all allegations are true.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.482]  But you should definitely take them seriously, especially if they come from young children.
[00:24:34.802 --> 00:24:38.204]  So regardless of what you think about this case, you know, it's a lot of he said, she said going on.
[00:24:38.504 --> 00:24:43.126]  We do have some hard and fast evidence that we're going to get into in some of our other articles.
[00:24:43.526 --> 00:24:44.187]  We'll start with this.
[00:24:44.347 --> 00:24:48.389]  Police arrest four adults for alleged acts with four-year-old children.
[00:24:49.349 --> 00:24:59.181]  South Carolina police arrested four people after two four-year-old children disclosed that they had been sexually assaulted at multiple locations over a five-month period.
[00:24:59.582 --> 00:25:01.364]  One of the locations was a strip club.
[00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:14.578]  Detectives received reports of sexual assault to children in January and followed up by conducting forensic interviews with the two four-year-olds, a boy and a girl, according to WMBF News.
[00:25:14.918 --> 00:25:17.740]  So in this one they had more stable legs to stand on.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.101]  They actually did some forensic interviews.
[00:25:20.161 --> 00:25:20.581]  I guess they
[00:25:21.702 --> 00:25:30.948]  Whatever the crime kit is they that's appropriate for children to see that the stories worked out And I guess they have enough to go ahead with the case now.
[00:25:30.968 --> 00:25:50.882]  Let's talk about some more international things UN sexual abuse more allegations more bureaucratic process in bands latest report and this is United Nations personnel including peacekeepers and 10 UN missions around the world were embroiled in 99 new allegations of sexual exploitation and or abuse last year
[00:25:51.962 --> 00:26:03.652]  One, nearly one quarter more than in 2014, according to the latest edition of an annual report on the ugly issue issued by UN Secretary General Bam Ki-moon.
[00:26:04.272 --> 00:26:14.301]  An independent panel last December castigated specific UN senior officials for their inaction and even cover-up of sexual abuse allegations against non-UN troops
[00:26:14.961 --> 00:26:19.405]  Under a Secretary Council mandate in the Central African Republic.
[00:26:19.425 --> 00:26:21.126]  So now we see allegations that the U.N.
[00:26:21.166 --> 00:26:23.828]  is actually covering up sexual misconduct.
[00:26:24.228 --> 00:26:25.790]  And you know, I know I talk a lot about the U.N.
[00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:31.434]  I think outside of, you know, things like this, the sexual abuse and outside of their gun grabbing agenda, the U.N.
[00:26:31.454 --> 00:26:32.295]  does a lot of good work.
[00:26:32.455 --> 00:26:35.996]  But I think they also have a lot to do as far as getting their house in order.
[00:26:36.317 --> 00:26:37.697]  And this is a report from the U.N.
[00:26:37.737 --> 00:26:39.858]  This isn't even so much outside investigators.
[00:26:39.878 --> 00:26:40.999]  This is the U.N.
[00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:42.959]  Secretary General, Bam Khaimoun.
[00:26:43.019 --> 00:26:45.040]  So they recognize in the U.N.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.501]  that there is a problem and it definitely needs to be addressed.
[00:26:48.062 --> 00:26:49.862]  Now, let's talk about some things going on in England.
[00:26:49.882 --> 00:26:51.403]  We talked about this report last week.
[00:26:51.863 --> 00:26:58.286]  Pedophile who led sex grooming ring in England using human rights laws to try to block deportation.
[00:26:58.706 --> 00:27:00.467]  So basically, Mr. Ahmad here,
[00:27:01.107 --> 00:27:05.190]  He was described by a judge as a violent, hypocrite bully.
[00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:15.776]  And Ahmaud says that she, the Secretary of State, is telling everybody that it's Muslims that's causing the problem, and it's basically Muslims that are the problems of the world.
[00:27:15.996 --> 00:27:17.277]  This is what the guy is saying.
[00:27:17.657 --> 00:27:20.838]  So basically, the guy, he's not even pulling the race card, he's pulling the religion card.
[00:27:21.118 --> 00:27:24.419]  He's saying, the only reason that you're prosecuting us is because we're Muslim.
[00:27:24.919 --> 00:27:40.223]  And I don't agree with this, because if you look at the article, it says the reason why they're prosecuting these guys is that Mr. Ahmad, or Amid himself, was given a 19-year sentence in Liverpool in 2012 for a string of child sexual offenses, including rape.
[00:27:40.583 --> 00:27:45.784]  He was also jailed for 22 years in July of 2012 for 30 rapes against another victim.
[00:27:46.304 --> 00:27:51.447]  30 rapes against one person, a string of child sexual offenses, including rape.
[00:27:51.507 --> 00:27:53.808]  I think that's exactly why you're being jailed and deported.
[00:27:53.828 --> 00:27:57.511]  It doesn't have anything to do with your religion, skin tone, or anything else.
[00:27:58.411 --> 00:28:03.334]  And like I said, those are international versions, but it also hits home right here, right here in the state of Texas.
[00:28:03.814 --> 00:28:08.477]  Ringleader in Texas' biggest sex trafficking ring, sentenced to life in prison.
[00:28:08.957 --> 00:28:14.299]  And a lot of times we think of the guys perpetrating these actions as men, but this is actually a woman.
[00:28:15.019 --> 00:28:19.921]  She goes by the name of Tensha, and she, as well as 14 other people, were ultimately charged.
[00:28:20.401 --> 00:28:28.024]  Undocumented women and girls were forced to have sex with men in various cantinas, according to evidence prosecutors presented at a trial.
[00:28:28.604 --> 00:28:30.925]  We had to work six days a week from 3 p.m.
[00:28:31.005 --> 00:28:31.845]  to 2 a.m.
[00:28:32.225 --> 00:28:38.968]  On weekends, we had to work later, one of the victims said of the trafficking organization when she was interviewed about it.
[00:28:39.408 --> 00:28:43.009]  So it's very horrific conditions that these people are forced to be in.
[00:28:43.129 --> 00:28:45.650]  And I know people make the argument, but what about the Bunny Ranch?
[00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:46.610]  What about some of these other things?
[00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:52.972]  Yes, I do understand there are people who are voluntary practitioners in the sex trade.
[00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:54.453]  And I mean, that's not my issue.
[00:28:54.493 --> 00:28:57.814]  If you want to go to the Bunny Ranch and have consensual sex and you're the woman
[00:28:58.474 --> 00:28:59.795]  That's your business, end of the day.
[00:29:00.136 --> 00:29:09.743]  My concern is for the people who are forced to do this, like the young girl in this article who had to work 12 hours a day to service all these strange men that came into the cantina.
[00:29:10.303 --> 00:29:18.529]  Going quickly here, now we have a PA Bishop, PA Bishops hiding sexual allegations of hundreds of children at grand jury fines.
[00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:25.755]  And some actions going on in Pennsylvania, and they say no criminal charges are going to be filed because many of the abusers have died.
[00:29:26.495 --> 00:29:34.419]  Or the status of limitations or statute of limitations has expired, and some of the victims, understandably, are too traumatized to testify.
[00:29:34.479 --> 00:29:35.960]  So this is alive and well.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.402]  It's not just, you know, an old cotton-picking movie.
[00:29:38.442 --> 00:29:43.504]  You know, slavery does exist, whether they're being worked to death or they're sex slaves or anything else.
[00:29:43.885 --> 00:29:49.287]  It's a very horrific situation, and I hope you guys will take the time to brush up on this, about it.
[00:29:49.628 --> 00:29:54.931]  And also, we have this report that I filed last year, along with Kit Daniels' report, Slavery Still Exists.
[00:29:55.951 --> 00:29:58.654]  Jakari Jackson for InfoWars.com.
[00:29:59.314 --> 00:30:02.878]  A topic I've been wanting to cover for a while now is that of human trafficking.
[00:30:03.358 --> 00:30:08.023]  And last week myself and Kit Daniels had a chance to go out to the Human 2020 event.
[00:30:08.403 --> 00:30:14.389]  And this was a showcasing of artists presenting their works in hopes of bringing more attention to the very serious issue.
[00:30:14.949 --> 00:30:17.692]  I had a chance to speak to some of the people behind the event.
[00:30:18.231 --> 00:30:20.552]  We're just impressed with the turnout this evening.
[00:30:20.812 --> 00:30:23.714]  Yeah, Human 2020 is an initiative.
[00:30:24.274 --> 00:30:26.315]  It is something that is coming from civil society.
[00:30:26.455 --> 00:30:28.576]  It is going all over the world.
[00:30:28.616 --> 00:30:32.878]  People are just picking it up and they're just saying, hey, what can we do to be part of the solution?
[00:30:32.938 --> 00:30:37.560]  So here in Austin, we have a bunch of professional artists that came together.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:44.924]  They said they wanted to create artwork to help raise the awareness around the issue in our city and around the world.
[00:30:45.404 --> 00:30:52.110]  Hi, I'm Nisha Khanna, and I'm part of the Human 2020 Anti-Human Trafficking Initiative.
[00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:54.652]  And over here we have salvaged jewelry.
[00:30:55.112 --> 00:31:07.143]  It's jewelry created by women salvaged from difficult situations in Sri Lanka, such as human trafficking, abuse, poverty, and it creates jobs for these women.
[00:31:08.103 --> 00:31:31.918]  It's made from a hundred percent recycled materials and so the play of it and the company's called salvage so that play upon the word of salvage materials for women that are salvaged and then all the proceeds go back into leading that business and creating jobs for women and helping them get out of that situation and be financially independent.
[00:31:32.139 --> 00:31:34.800]  And then we have some of the
[00:31:36.482 --> 00:31:37.382]  Bangles?
[00:31:37.422 --> 00:31:37.923]  Bracelets?
[00:31:38.043 --> 00:31:39.985]  I strung two sets together.
[00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:42.107]  I have that one.
[00:31:42.207 --> 00:31:45.250]  And then I have these earrings.
[00:31:47.213 --> 00:31:53.819]  The women get paid, and the people that produce the materials, they get paid for what they do and what they produce.
[00:31:53.939 --> 00:31:56.601]  Then also there's an additional amount on top of that.
[00:31:56.641 --> 00:31:59.964]  That helps to fund other projects that Salvage supports.
[00:32:00.845 --> 00:32:07.530]  In Sri Lanka, for example, the only HIV drop-in center in the country is funded by Salvage.
[00:32:07.911 --> 00:32:11.614]  And Govinda left us with a few ways you can get involved outside of the event.
[00:32:12.071 --> 00:32:17.836]  Well, I think part of it is beginning to raise your own awareness, beginning to understand the issue.
[00:32:17.856 --> 00:32:28.405]  I mean, you can connect with Human 2020, but I would suggest more do something within your own community, do something within your own location, your own city, your own town.
[00:32:30.266 --> 00:32:31.327]  Connect with people there.
[00:32:31.647 --> 00:32:33.669]  Find out what's going on in your community.
[00:32:33.969 --> 00:32:37.152]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[00:34:02.042 --> 00:34:08.204]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:34:08.224 --> 00:34:11.526]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:34:11.546 --> 00:34:13.286]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:34:13.326 --> 00:34:19.589]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:34:19.689 --> 00:34:25.611]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:34:25.751 --> 00:34:29.514]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:34:29.694 --> 00:34:32.637]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:34:32.777 --> 00:34:40.803]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:34:41.064 --> 00:34:43.105]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:34:43.145 --> 00:34:44.286]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:34:44.566 --> 00:34:46.248]  It's more vital than ever.
[00:34:46.408 --> 00:34:46.888]  I'm good to go.

[00:37:05.383 --> 00:37:06.865]  Jesse, so much happening.
[00:37:06.925 --> 00:37:08.446]  I got a lot of questions, a lot of comments.
[00:37:08.466 --> 00:37:09.927]  I want to play some of the debate clips.
[00:37:09.947 --> 00:37:12.629]  I want to play a clip of this campaign ad.
[00:37:12.689 --> 00:37:18.514]  Kasich, the warmonger, who acts like he's a sweet little old man, was running where, how dare Trump not want to have war?
[00:37:18.794 --> 00:37:19.634]  He's a tyrant.
[00:37:20.095 --> 00:37:22.277]  So he says, make America a tyranny again.
[00:37:22.897 --> 00:37:24.398]  I thought they're turning us into a tyranny.
[00:37:24.438 --> 00:37:26.240]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.521]  Good to talk to you.
[00:37:28.441 --> 00:37:29.923]  Hi Alex, great to be here.
[00:37:29.983 --> 00:37:33.546]  Yeah, I went on CNN last night.
[00:37:33.586 --> 00:37:43.455]  I know the debates I think were on Fox or whatever, so probably not a lot of people heard what I had to say, but I brought up to them something that is really troubling to me.
[00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:45.950]  First of all, let me state this.
[00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:58.315]  With all the current candidates that you have out there and that have been out there within the last four to five months, I know a lot of them have dropped out, I have one thing that none of them candidates have.
[00:37:59.316 --> 00:38:02.217]  I have one thing that Trump's money can't buy.
[00:38:02.237 --> 00:38:05.738]  I have one thing that none of these candidates have.
[00:38:05.778 --> 00:38:06.819]  You know what that is, Alex?
[00:38:09.236 --> 00:38:19.381]  I have an honorable discharge from the United States Navy where I served from September the 11th, 1969 until September the 10th, 1975.
[00:38:19.461 --> 00:38:24.163]  Six years full on active duty, two years in the reserves.
[00:38:25.263 --> 00:38:31.546]  So what I brought up last night on Don Lemon was something that disturbs me to no end.
[00:38:32.584 --> 00:38:43.915]  And that is that maybe I'll let these people off the hook because none of them were in the military, so maybe they're ignorant and they don't know about what I'm going to talk about.
[00:38:44.536 --> 00:38:46.317]  Maybe that's it, I'm not sure.
[00:38:47.198 --> 00:38:55.326]  But I brought up the fact that every Republican candidate right now has stated that they would commit a war crime.
[00:38:56.488 --> 00:39:00.969]  That if the situation arose, they would okay torture.
[00:39:01.169 --> 00:39:03.610]  They try to one-up each other on what they do.
[00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:07.851]  Well, and the point is, that is a war crime, Alex.
[00:39:08.331 --> 00:39:17.274]  If I did that as a member of the military and I took an oath, I would not receive an honorable discharge committing a war crime.
[00:39:17.694 --> 00:39:18.114]  I agree.
[00:39:18.154 --> 00:39:22.735]  How can the alleged leader of the military
[00:39:23.738 --> 00:39:28.742]  Openly admit that he or she would commit war crimes.
[00:39:28.802 --> 00:39:29.743]  Are you kidding me?
[00:39:29.763 --> 00:39:33.786]  And nobody in the media jumps on that.
[00:39:34.047 --> 00:39:44.035]  Well, it's probably a good thing you didn't watch because you're friends with... I guess it's bad to have David Duke endorse you or whatever, but that's out of your control.
[00:39:44.856 --> 00:39:48.659]  But to sit and openly state, Trump included,
[00:39:49.562 --> 00:39:56.010]  That they would commit war crimes and they're going to be commander-in-chief of the U.S.
[00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:56.731]  military?
[00:39:56.751 --> 00:40:02.057]  And I'm astounded the media doesn't even bring that up.
[00:40:03.118 --> 00:40:08.745]  Doesn't question them to the level they're questioning them on these other issues.
[00:40:09.232 --> 00:40:23.850]  I'm glad you raised this because that's my biggest issue with Trump is, he has Hayden who was involved in all sorts of illegal stuff and authorizing torture, illegal spying, former head of the NSA, former head of the CIA, going on Bill Maher's show.
[00:40:25.051 --> 00:40:31.093]  Uh, and saying, oh, he couldn't be president because the military won't follow his orders to do illegal things.
[00:40:31.413 --> 00:40:33.474]  They've got most of the military following orders.
[00:40:33.534 --> 00:40:38.715]  And Trump showed a very tyrannical edge when he said, don't worry, I'm a leader.
[00:40:38.955 --> 00:40:40.396]  The troops will follow my orders.
[00:40:40.876 --> 00:40:42.437]  And unfortunately, a lot of them would.
[00:40:42.457 --> 00:40:47.699]  I know he wants to, quote, get tough on ISIS and stuff, but you don't get tough on them lowering yourself to their level.
[00:40:47.719 --> 00:40:53.101]  So I like, on one hand, he says we shouldn't be in Syria, we shouldn't have war with Russia, we shouldn't have created ISIS.
[00:40:53.581 --> 00:41:03.064]  He tells the truth about 9-11 and Saudi Arabia and does great things, but then he flips over and says, you know, we'll go after the wives of terrorists.
[00:41:03.144 --> 00:41:04.965]  It's just, what do you think of that, sir?
[00:41:05.609 --> 00:41:07.030]  Well, that's ridiculous.
[00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:12.494]  You're asking, you're putting a person who took an oath like I did in the United States military.
[00:41:13.595 --> 00:41:16.077]  Obviously the President's not gonna do it.
[00:41:16.657 --> 00:41:20.340]  It's gonna be brutes on the ground that will be asked to torture people.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.001]  Or to kill innocent people.
[00:41:24.222 --> 00:41:25.283]  And how dare them?
[00:41:26.144 --> 00:41:28.966]  How dare them when they've never served themselves?
[00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:46.101]  They've never been in a position where their life was on the line, serving their country, and here they would ask people who have put their lives on the line, who have taken that oath, to now go out and commit war crimes at their behest?
[00:41:47.022 --> 00:41:53.566]  Since you raised this... And have people commit war crimes?
[00:41:54.247 --> 00:41:57.569]  I mean, this sounds like something that would be in the elections of 1930 Germany.
[00:42:00.538 --> 00:42:01.078]  Absolutely.
[00:42:01.098 --> 00:42:02.879]  Well, they actually kept stuff like that secret there.
[00:42:03.079 --> 00:42:09.863]  Joe Biggs, who was written about in Esquire and Vanity Fair, profiled by the late, great Hastings, Michael Hastings.
[00:42:09.903 --> 00:42:11.183]  In fact, I wonder if he's here right now.
[00:42:11.203 --> 00:42:15.045]  I want to drag him in in the control room next break to talk to Ventura briefly.
[00:42:15.085 --> 00:42:16.086]  He's an Army veteran.
[00:42:17.066 --> 00:42:18.207]  It was at three or four tours.
[00:42:19.047 --> 00:42:21.408]  We've got Purple Hearts and Discharge Honorable.
[00:42:21.488 --> 00:42:26.211]  He says he doesn't really feel guilty because he didn't really understand what was happening at the time, but later he did.
[00:42:26.791 --> 00:42:28.772]  They would order them to go pick people up.
[00:42:29.332 --> 00:42:32.414]  Yes, and that falls directly to the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief.
[00:42:59.031 --> 00:43:01.114]  The President of the United States.
[00:43:02.055 --> 00:43:10.545]  And when the President condones committing war crimes, the United States and its people should hang their head in shame.
[00:43:11.423 --> 00:43:21.525]  Because, fine, you're fighting terrorists, you're fighting people that are probably not very good people, but we should always hold ourselves to a higher standard.
[00:43:21.745 --> 00:43:23.225]  Well, that's what George Washington said.
[00:43:23.285 --> 00:43:24.605]  The British did a lot of atrocities.
[00:43:24.625 --> 00:43:25.946]  It's one reason the public turned against him.
[00:43:26.306 --> 00:43:33.087]  Washington hung members of the colonial military if they got caught engaging in any war crimes.
[00:43:33.187 --> 00:43:34.027]  Absolutely.
[00:43:34.447 --> 00:43:38.428]  You have to hold yourself to a higher standard to be on the side of right.
[00:43:39.857 --> 00:43:42.018]  And let me put it to you this way.
[00:43:42.678 --> 00:43:45.699]  All of these candidates, they can get away with it.
[00:43:45.719 --> 00:43:47.400]  They're not going to be put in danger.
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:53.642]  When they tell you that they're going to support torture, that puts our military in danger.
[00:43:53.722 --> 00:43:59.484]  Remember when Bush let people get prosecuted who followed orders of torture, and then he didn't get in trouble?
[00:44:00.288 --> 00:44:15.258]  Absolutely, but our men and women have been in danger because if they're captured or anything happens to them, well, if we torture, what right do we have to complain if our young men and women in service get caught and tortured?
[00:44:15.298 --> 00:44:17.179]  There's a reason society develops chivalry.
[00:44:17.199 --> 00:44:19.821]  It's because you don't want stuff happening to your wives and children.
[00:44:19.921 --> 00:44:21.402]  And there's something else, too.
[00:44:21.802 --> 00:44:23.403]  There's something called honor.
[00:44:24.392 --> 00:44:29.835]  And when you take the oath to serve in the United States military, you take an oath of honor.
[00:44:30.175 --> 00:44:33.217]  And torture and war crimes are not honor.
[00:44:33.297 --> 00:44:33.738]  Powerful.
[00:44:33.778 --> 00:44:34.118]  Stay there.
[00:44:34.318 --> 00:44:34.698]  Stay there.
[00:44:36.679 --> 00:44:39.661]  Jesse, you were just over in Russia at a big press dinner a few months ago.
[00:44:39.701 --> 00:44:42.323]  Your interview here on that went viral.
[00:44:42.723 --> 00:44:44.504]  I want to bring Joe Biggs in since he's here.
[00:44:44.544 --> 00:44:50.928]  Joe, just briefly tell Governor Ventura, it's a short segment, I don't even know if you were listening earlier, just your experience bringing people for torture.
[00:44:51.991 --> 00:45:09.249]  Yeah, we would go out on missions in Afghanistan and we'd have these OGA guys with us, other government agencies, and we would go and do tactical site exploitations, clear houses where there were IED bomb-making facilities, and essentially we'd take these guys back.
[00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:20.116]  And these OGA guys would come in and interrogate them, and we'd sit outside the little compound out in the Coast Province, and we would sit there, and you could hear the screams and yells, and it was pretty intense.
[00:45:20.556 --> 00:45:21.697]  And that stuff happened a lot.
[00:45:21.717 --> 00:45:23.298]  Some people came out, some people didn't.
[00:45:23.778 --> 00:45:24.138]  You know?
[00:45:24.338 --> 00:45:29.161]  And we would be told to go guard opium fields, and sometimes we'd be told to take them out.
[00:45:29.802 --> 00:45:33.884]  It was a pinning whether or not these farmers would play ball with the military.
[00:45:34.386 --> 00:45:44.389]  Now, you could argue, hey, they got bombs, they're planning to blow somebody up, we gotta torture them to find out who they're gonna kill next, that's the Machiavellian idea, but then our own government's growing the opium, and then funding ISIS, and now it's worse than ever.
[00:45:44.429 --> 00:45:55.192]  Well, they were more concerned with protecting those opium fields than they were actually detaining and interrogating these IED-making facility places, these people that were operating.
[00:45:55.532 --> 00:45:56.372]  These guys would
[00:45:56.832 --> 00:46:00.156]  Get captured and then essentially released not that long after.
[00:46:00.516 --> 00:46:06.303]  It's the ones who wasn't going to play ball with the opium pills, those are the ones who would get it the most because that's where the most money was made.
[00:46:10.842 --> 00:46:18.769]  Well, you know, the more I hear about these wars, both Afghanistan and Iraq and all that, I'll just say this.
[00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:22.632]  You know, I had a young man who I kind of tutored.
[00:46:22.652 --> 00:46:24.274]  He went into the Navy SEALs.
[00:46:24.334 --> 00:46:25.415]  He went to Iraq.
[00:46:25.455 --> 00:46:26.115]  He came back.
[00:46:26.155 --> 00:46:27.757]  He actually brought me something.
[00:46:28.537 --> 00:46:29.217]  We're good to go.
[00:46:47.503 --> 00:46:56.110]  And, uh, you know, what I'm watching in these wars, when people tell me to ask me if a war is justified, it's a real simple answer to me.
[00:46:56.151 --> 00:46:58.753]  A war is justified if you're willing to send your son.
[00:47:03.016 --> 00:47:04.017]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.558 --> 00:47:06.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:14.967]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.469]  We're good.
[00:49:06.556 --> 00:49:10.780]  I have some breaking news right now that's coming out of the New York Daily News.
[00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:17.827]  They posted a complete guide to fleeing President Donald Trump's America.
[00:49:19.949 --> 00:49:24.914]  This is the liberal response to a potential Donald Trump presidency, right?
[00:49:24.934 --> 00:49:29.598]  They are saying that left-leaning Americans all across the nation, they plan to pack it up.
[00:49:30.439 --> 00:49:31.300]  Yeah, good riddance.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:36.245]  Don't they have that gif of Bugs Bunny sawing off Canada from America and the Canadians are all like, no, we don't want it.
[00:49:47.375 --> 00:50:00.221]  It's a complete guide with passports, they got how to get your work visa, they even suggest other countries and places like Canada, Singapore, they suggest that you can go to parts of Mexico.
[00:50:00.241 --> 00:50:02.642]  Hey, you can go to Venezuela!
[00:50:02.682 --> 00:50:06.024]  Venezuela is not on that list, isn't that strange?
[00:50:06.324 --> 00:50:07.985]  Oh, but they also have the Cuba.
[00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:10.066]  Bernie Sanders loves so much that's not on the list.
[00:50:10.566 --> 00:50:16.452]  Miley Cyrus said she's going to leave if Donald Trump wins, so I'm really fully behind Donald Trump.
[00:50:16.492 --> 00:50:18.434]  He really is going to make America great again.
[00:50:18.574 --> 00:50:19.375]  Yeah.
[00:50:19.395 --> 00:50:20.736]  We need to get rid of that woman.
[00:50:21.156 --> 00:50:26.041]  This is the complete guide to a liberal evacuation of America.
[00:50:26.161 --> 00:50:28.684]  I think we need to stand behind them and get behind this.
[00:50:28.724 --> 00:50:30.245]  This is something I totally agree with.
[00:50:30.485 --> 00:50:32.848]  So let's back up the New York Daily Times on this.
[00:50:33.168 --> 00:50:34.649]  Yeah, maybe they'll self-deport.
[00:50:34.809 --> 00:50:35.170]  Who knows?
[00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:37.911]  Hey, there's some breaking news out of the Washington Examiner.
[00:50:37.931 --> 00:50:39.753]  It's on top of Drudge Report right now.
[00:50:40.333 --> 00:50:44.455]  Trump names Senator Sessions chair of his national security team.
[00:50:44.755 --> 00:50:46.016]  So this is going on right now.
[00:50:46.036 --> 00:50:46.877]  He just tweeted that out.
[00:50:47.197 --> 00:50:52.200]  Says Donald Trump on Thursday named Sessions as chairman of his national security advisory committee.
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:51:03.086]  Trump's campaign said Sessions, a local advocate of tougher enforcement of the nation's immigration laws, would counsel Trump on foreign policy and homeland security.
[00:51:03.346 --> 00:51:04.307]  So what do you guys think about that?
[00:51:04.966 --> 00:51:13.011]  Well, I don't agree with, that's one of the things I don't agree with Senator Sessions on, is his approach to security and homeland security in the National Police State.
[00:51:13.452 --> 00:51:17.354]  However, Senator Sessions is the only one who's looked at these trade agreements.
[00:51:17.954 --> 00:51:22.097]  He knows that it's not just an issue of bad economics, it's an issue of sovereignty.
[00:51:22.437 --> 00:51:24.879]  He did a very large presentation to the Senate about that.
[00:51:24.959 --> 00:51:29.242]  He's been presenting this information to Donald Trump, from what we've heard now, since August.
[00:51:29.802 --> 00:51:32.904]  And so I agree with him as an advisor.
[00:51:33.024 --> 00:51:36.287]  I think Senator Sessions is a man of the utmost integrity.
[00:51:36.627 --> 00:51:40.050]  I respect him even though I disagree with him on some of the security issues.
[00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:40.750]  Yeah, I agree.
[00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:42.691]  Yeah, he's somebody that cannot be bought.
[00:51:42.772 --> 00:51:51.258]  Of course, there's that famous back and forth between him and Leon Panetta saying, well, you know, if we're going to have a no-fly zone over Syria, who would make that decision?
[00:51:51.318 --> 00:51:58.463]  Leon Panetta said, well, we would, who at the time was Secretary of Defense, we would go to the United Nations, we would go to NATO, and he goes,
[00:51:58.703 --> 00:51:59.844]  I can't believe what I'm hearing.
[00:51:59.864 --> 00:52:01.966]  You're a congressman, you know what the process is.
[00:52:01.986 --> 00:52:03.247]  We've got a constitutional process.
[00:52:03.527 --> 00:52:04.488]  They simply don't care.
[00:52:04.889 --> 00:52:12.475]  So at least he cares about that part of it and I guess we would have to, of course he's also a drug warrior as well, so we'll have to see what happens with that.
[00:52:13.056 --> 00:52:16.639]  ...over your failure to denounce David Duke on Sunday.
[00:52:16.699 --> 00:52:21.804]  You have repeatedly disavowed him since then, but I'd like to go deeper than that.
[00:52:22.424 --> 00:52:26.569]  What are your views on the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacists?
[00:52:26.729 --> 00:52:30.032]  I totally disavow the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:52:30.213 --> 00:52:32.695]  I totally disavow David Duke.
[00:52:32.996 --> 00:52:34.617]  I've been doing it now for two weeks.
[00:52:34.657 --> 00:52:37.881]  This is, you're probably about the 18th person that's asked me the question.
[00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:39.563]  It was very clear.
[00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:43.424]  That question was also talked about in the form of groups.
[00:52:43.584 --> 00:52:43.864]  Groups.
[00:52:44.104 --> 00:52:45.845]  I want to know, which groups are you talking about?
[00:52:45.865 --> 00:52:46.925]  You have to tell me which groups.
[00:52:47.325 --> 00:52:51.186]  Ultimately, he got to the Klu Klux Klan, which obviously I'm going to disavow.
[00:52:51.626 --> 00:52:57.568]  And by the way, if you look at my Twitter account, almost immediately after the program, they were disavowed again.
[00:52:57.588 --> 00:52:58.949]  You know, it's amazing.
[00:52:59.189 --> 00:53:01.769]  When I do something on Twitter, everybody picks it up.
[00:53:01.809 --> 00:53:02.730]  Goes all over the place.
[00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:05.010]  But when I did this one, nobody ever picks it up.
[00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:06.971]  Take a look at my Twitter account.
[00:53:07.712 --> 00:53:08.277]  Thank you sir.
[00:53:08.297 --> 00:53:08.579]  Thank you.
[00:53:12.005 --> 00:53:12.846]  Well see, there you have it.
[00:53:12.886 --> 00:53:27.055]  I mean, they keep trying everything they can to go after Trump for these alleged, you know, endorsements and allowing this David Duke guy to so-called say that he wants to call people to vote for him.
[00:53:27.515 --> 00:53:32.098]  You know, he's come out many times saying that he doesn't, you know, support David Duke.
[00:53:32.418 --> 00:53:38.322]  He doesn't support what the KKK does, and yet that's all the mainstream media is focused on.
[00:53:38.902 --> 00:53:40.643]  Joe, I gotta say, Chris Wallace has absolutely no shame.
[00:53:58.428 --> 00:54:03.472]  To start out the debate with that canard, that is the most ridiculous thing.
[00:54:03.753 --> 00:54:07.235]  He's not a journalist, he's a propagandist when he does something like that.
[00:54:07.275 --> 00:54:09.397]  He ought to be ashamed of himself for doing that.
[00:54:09.437 --> 00:54:11.759]  Chris Wallace, you're nothing but a tool.
[00:54:12.179 --> 00:54:13.520]  You're nothing but a tool.
[00:54:13.661 --> 00:54:19.645]  They don't have a graphic to criticize the tax plans of the other three people on the stage either.
[00:54:19.986 --> 00:54:25.210]  That's something they're doing just for Donald Trump, just like they did the ridiculous KKK question together.
[00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:26.911]  Sorry, I was just going to say that the whole KKK thing
[00:54:45.904 --> 00:54:48.228]  Uh, Donald Trump totally lost my vote with that.
[00:54:48.248 --> 00:54:52.496]  I think he was playing politics more or less than a whole earpiece thing.
[00:54:52.776 --> 00:54:55.200]  I think that was just BS with the earpiece thing.
[00:54:55.401 --> 00:54:57.284]  I think honestly he was playing politics.
[00:54:58.177 --> 00:54:59.238]  I disagree with you.
[00:54:59.418 --> 00:55:00.419]  I disagree with you on that.
[00:55:00.459 --> 00:55:02.341]  I think they were the ones who were playing politics.
[00:55:02.961 --> 00:55:08.486]  And, you know, I have an earpiece and you can hear we're going back and forth trying to establish your phone connection.
[00:55:08.787 --> 00:55:17.494]  But he had said that he wasn't going to run in the Reform Party for president because of David Duke and because of Leonora Folani, who is a communist.
[00:55:17.535 --> 00:55:19.296]  He said, I don't want to be associated with people like that.
[00:55:19.316 --> 00:55:24.321]  I mean, do you honestly believe, to me, it's exactly, I'll let you respond to this, but let me say one more thing.
[00:55:25.054 --> 00:55:26.636]  It was like the situation we had.
[00:55:26.676 --> 00:55:35.724]  Remember they put out that video for a day, the Cruz campaign did, saying that Marco Rubio walked by Ted Cruz's dad, saw a Bible on the table and said, there's no answers in that book?
[00:55:36.165 --> 00:55:37.146]  And that was a total lie.
[00:55:37.166 --> 00:55:38.767]  They left that out there for a day and a half.
[00:55:39.248 --> 00:55:42.831]  Who would criticize the Bible in a campaign?
[00:55:43.131 --> 00:55:44.172]  And who would take
[00:55:44.913 --> 00:55:49.074]  Who would love the endorsement and embrace the KKK?
[00:55:49.194 --> 00:55:50.714]  Hillary and Bill Clinton!
[00:55:51.454 --> 00:56:09.018]  Which you do not see the media playing that, and that's why I've told everyone to bombard it on Twitter, because Hillary Clinton actually, you know, commends this guy, but Bill Clinton tries to apologize for Robert Byrd joining the KKK, saying, oh, he had to do that to get elected.
[00:56:09.038 --> 00:56:10.519]  Let's go back to Jason.
[00:56:10.539 --> 00:56:11.639]  Jason, what do you think about that?
[00:56:12.378 --> 00:56:13.679]  It's not about race.
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:15.461]  Quit bringing race into it.
[00:56:15.762 --> 00:56:19.826]  Who's bringing race into it?
[00:56:19.846 --> 00:56:21.027]  Let me ask you this.
[00:56:21.307 --> 00:56:25.992]  What do you think about Louis Farrakhan bringing race into it and endorsing Donald Trump?
[00:56:26.012 --> 00:56:30.938]  Do you think that somebody should be calling on Donald Trump to disavow Louis Farrakhan as well?
[00:56:30.958 --> 00:56:34.581]  Do you have to disavow everybody, go down the list of people who have endorsed you?
[00:56:34.882 --> 00:56:35.042]  Yeah.
[00:56:35.882 --> 00:56:37.523]  You keep bringing race into it.
[00:56:37.603 --> 00:56:38.384]  It's not about race.
[00:56:38.404 --> 00:56:39.444]  Who said anything about race?
[00:56:39.604 --> 00:56:41.486]  It's about his character.
[00:56:41.506 --> 00:56:44.127]  The fact of the matter is, he repeated the question twice.
[00:56:44.588 --> 00:56:48.610]  He repeated the question twice to the person who was asking the question.
[00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:50.832]  And twice, he didn't disavow.
[00:56:50.952 --> 00:56:52.273]  He was playing politics.
[00:56:52.593 --> 00:56:53.673]  He repeated the question.
[00:56:53.834 --> 00:56:54.894]  Even if you didn't hear him.
[00:56:55.174 --> 00:56:56.495]  Even if your piece was going out.
[00:56:56.916 --> 00:57:00.098]  He heard the question enough to repeat it twice.
[00:57:00.498 --> 00:57:02.019]  And he still didn't disavow.
[00:57:02.179 --> 00:57:03.440]  He was playing politics.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.561]  Well, I disagree.
[00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:05.682]  I totally disagree.
[00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:14.691]  I think the people who are playing politics are the people who continue to say, after he has disavowed it, after he's put it on his social media, they continue to do this.
[00:57:14.952 --> 00:57:23.701]  I think you and Chris Wallace should be ashamed of yourself for promoting this divisive racism, using this canard and bringing it up.
[00:57:23.901 --> 00:57:25.703]  Get on, move on to some real issues.
[00:57:25.763 --> 00:57:26.404]  Thank you, Jason.
[00:57:26.764 --> 00:57:33.446]  I don't know, but it would be interesting to see how many of these reporters would release their conversations that are off the record.
[00:57:33.466 --> 00:57:35.987]  I think that's kind of ridiculous that they would ask that.
[00:57:36.267 --> 00:57:39.468]  Right, especially Fox News.
[00:57:40.089 --> 00:57:46.371]  These are reporters, journalists, supposedly, who are asking a candidate if he would release off-the-record comments.
[00:57:46.951 --> 00:57:50.332]  I just don't understand that frame of mind.
[00:57:50.652 --> 00:58:09.828]  Well, and especially since it was either Saturday or Sunday, the entire conservative talk radio has been set afire by the New York Times article alleging that Fox News met off the record with these people to conspire to tell lies about Rubio's amnesty program with Chuckie Schumer.
[00:58:10.188 --> 00:58:11.329]  So they met off the record.
[00:58:11.669 --> 00:58:15.933]  There are allegations that Rush Limbaugh met off the record with Roger Ailes and Rupert Murdoch.
[00:58:16.553 --> 00:58:18.034]  But they're not releasing any of that.
[00:58:18.274 --> 00:58:24.878]  So for them to make this a point of contention, and to repeatedly ask this of Donald Trump, well tell us what was said off the record.
[00:58:25.098 --> 00:58:33.604]  Well why don't you, Fox News, why don't you ask Roger Ailes what was said off the record about the amnesty plan that Marco Rubio had.
