[00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.326]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:23.667]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:25.028]  It is July 28th, 2016.
[00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:28.891]  Now we have something a little different for you here tonight.
[00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:31.953]  We recently wrapped up our 28-hour broadcast.
[00:00:31.973 --> 00:00:33.654]  This was Operation Sleeping Giant.
[00:00:33.994 --> 00:00:35.875]  It was our fundraiser and super sale.
[00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:41.799]  And I do believe if you go to InfoWarsShop.com, you can still catch some of the tail end of those great deals.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.742]  But in addition to all the specials, the things that were available to purchase,
[00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:48.544]  We also brought you a ton of original content.
[00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:53.649]  Myself, Alex Jones, Leanne McAdoo, David Knight, and the list goes on and on.
[00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:58.392]  All the live presenters who were there for you to present you with all the material.
[00:00:58.753 --> 00:01:03.557]  And we're going to have a boil down of some of that in case you did not have a chance to watch it live.
[00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:14.927]  We're going to have Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, also radio host George Norris syndicated Nationwide, and the so-called comedian who spit on Alex Jones at the RNC.
[00:01:15.027 --> 00:01:18.670]  All this is coming up right here on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:02.377]  Hi, I'm Dr. David Jones.
[00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:05.420]  I've been in practice for over 30 years in dentistry.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.444]  In our health histories, we've always asked what people's primary complaint were.
[00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:12.006]  A third of the time, it's, I want whiter teeth.
[00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:26.279]  In the early days of dentistry, we used some fairly harsh chemicals in order to bleach the teeth and whiten them, and people were happy with the results, even though it created hypersensitivity and some problems that I consider fairly high risk.
[00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.901]  Recently, I was exposed to the Ghost Smile System.
[00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:36.324]  It allows a whitening gel to be applied to the teeth with a very good ultrasonic toothbrush system.
[00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:51.691]  The gel is activated by a light-emitting diode, or actually two light-emitting diodes, so it's a simple and elegant procedure that delivers office-quality whitening, and you don't have to spend the $600 it typically costs for an in-office treatment.
[00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:55.772]  In my opinion, it's the most elegant and best value that I've ever seen.
[00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:59.793]  To get your GoSmile system, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:03:14.773 --> 00:03:27.436]  And that got me, because I've built houses, and I saw the bricklayers who worked, family businesses, these guys were multi-generational, the old man was building the bricks, the older boy was bringing the mortar, the young kid was breaking it up and mixing it.
[00:03:27.496 --> 00:03:32.737]  I mean, those jobs are going to be gone, yes, but there's going to be other jobs that take the place of those.
[00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:39.478]  And still, you're going to have people living in these houses, you're going to have this equipment that's going to have to be moved and manufactured and repaired.
[00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:43.399]  There's going to be other jobs out there, but if we don't have any jobs whatsoever,
[00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:49.777]  You know, we're just going to slip into that third world status that we're going into right now.
[00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:58.921]  But what do you think when you see things like that of computers being able to build and print houses literally, you know, not out of thin air, but by themselves almost?
[00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:15.375]  Well, technology has always made our lives easier, and there's always been a fear of technology, whether you're in a field that will end up left in the dust because of technology, or you think your field will be completely replaced by technology.
[00:04:15.415 --> 00:04:22.157]  That fear has always existed, I think, just in the working man and in the job world.
[00:04:22.657 --> 00:04:25.700]  So, but who's going to, you know, who's going to program these robots?
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.162]  Who's going to design these robots?
[00:04:27.182 --> 00:04:27.682]  You know, this is good.
[00:04:27.702 --> 00:04:29.484]  They're going to have to be teams of people that are doing this.
[00:04:29.544 --> 00:04:31.767]  So, yeah, there's going to be new jobs created.
[00:04:31.787 --> 00:04:39.315]  The issue that that I think I hope we don't see is that we don't have enough people to fill those jobs.
[00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:42.197]  I mean, I couldn't program a robot to build a house.
[00:04:42.237 --> 00:04:42.817]  I don't know about you.
[00:04:42.837 --> 00:04:47.561]  I know people that could, but we need to push more people in that direction.
[00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:55.427]  What we need to do is we need to start pushing people in the direction of careers and trades and things that they can learn that they can actually use in the future.
[00:04:56.188 --> 00:05:00.051]  The higher education system is so outdated for probably
[00:05:01.672 --> 00:05:09.261]  I mean, 75% of college graduates probably don't really learn anything in college that they were going to use in the real world.
[00:05:09.322 --> 00:05:11.404]  It's just a matter of, did you study?
[00:05:11.484 --> 00:05:12.786]  Did you do enough to pass?
[00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:15.649]  Did you study this and do this and that and all that other stuff?
[00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.953]  And I think that there's a lot of people that are relating to this now.
[00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:25.835]  I think the answer is if you think that there's not going to be jobs, then go into engineering or be a doctor.
[00:05:26.276 --> 00:05:29.316]  These are jobs that we know we're going to need in the future.
[00:05:29.336 --> 00:05:36.338]  Someone's going to have to design the machines and someone's going to have to try to repair that person's arm when the machine malfunctions and rips it off.
[00:05:36.398 --> 00:05:43.720]  So I think that new jobs will be created just as jobs are destroyed by machines, which a lot of people are seeing inevitable at this point.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.140]  And then, of course, you have the people
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:52.364]  On top of this, you think that robots will just replace all humans at some point in time and the human element is not even in their picture.
[00:05:52.624 --> 00:05:53.724]  That's what we need to avoid.
[00:05:54.105 --> 00:05:55.886]  Yeah, I totally agree with you there.
[00:05:55.926 --> 00:06:03.770]  That is definitely something that could be scary as an apocalypse-type scenario where the Terminator robots say, we don't need humans, we're just going to turn you into batteries now.
[00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.973]  And then we get something like what we see with the Matrix.
[00:06:06.993 --> 00:06:13.319]  But I think it's interesting that, you know, if you look back when the car was created, people are like, what about all these horses?
[00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:14.720]  What about all these stable guys?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.843]  What about all this industry that were created around the horse and carriage?
[00:06:18.103 --> 00:06:22.927]  Well, it was replaced with a new industry and people still had jobs, but you had to change and adapt.
[00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:28.392]  And that's the world we're looking at is changing and adapting, but it's going to be a little faster than every one or two generations.
[00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:28.853]  It's going to be
[00:06:29.113 --> 00:06:34.596]  You're going to have multi-generational adaptations going on, but the good thing is that information is available to us.
[00:06:34.996 --> 00:06:42.540]  And I will point out that the cover of this month's Consumer Reports said, I'm paraphrasing, going to college ruined my life.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:50.644]  These people are in massive debts and they can't get jobs in order to support that $100,000 debt that they have that is basically worthless to them.
[00:06:51.084 --> 00:06:52.585]  So it is an interesting world.
[00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:57.508]  But there will be places for people like you and me who go out and report news.
[00:06:58.348 --> 00:06:59.950]  And make horrible memes like this.
[00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.652]  Check out this meme, guys, on the camera.
[00:07:03.393 --> 00:07:04.094]  I put this one out.
[00:07:04.555 --> 00:07:06.577]  The face you make when you catch a Triggly Turk.
[00:07:06.637 --> 00:07:09.339]  And it's me and Alex on camera.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.180]  Someone else shot this.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.704]  I think this video ended up on WorldStarHipHop.
[00:07:13.744 --> 00:07:15.866]  It transcended everything.
[00:07:16.247 --> 00:07:18.229]  When Alex went up on the Young Turks Show,
[00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:22.110]  On media row for the RNC, and everybody went crazy.
[00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.011]  So, put your Triggly Turk memes out there, just as Joe Biggs coined it the other day.
[00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:30.532]  And that's, I think that's one way we can educate people, is with these little memes.
[00:07:31.312 --> 00:07:35.253]  Make people see things differently, and they chuckle, but it sticks with you.
[00:07:35.273 --> 00:07:37.033]  It's like, oh yeah, that guy is a total sellout.
[00:07:37.073 --> 00:07:46.375]  He's a total freak who loves to talk about other people, and then his other co-hosts are fat-shaming people, and, you know, get caught basically being giant hypocrites.
[00:07:47.642 --> 00:07:49.583]  Alright I gotta ask you a question about that.
[00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:54.625]  Were they live on air when you guys went on the stage or were they just recording?
[00:07:55.326 --> 00:07:57.847]  I think it was live because they said they cut their live stream.
[00:07:57.927 --> 00:08:03.650]  I heard somebody say that and one of the producers came up and she was pushing my camera like thinking I'm gonna move.
[00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:12.694]  She didn't even ask me she just starts pushing my camera and I go don't touch me don't touch me she goes we're live right now and and I said okay and I moved out of the way of their camera but
[00:08:13.374 --> 00:08:25.083]  I'm there to shoot video of Alex and I'm not moving for anybody, especially their arbitrary lines that they think they develop and they own the whole place now because they're the Young Turks pushing propaganda.
[00:08:26.033 --> 00:08:27.053]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:08:27.753 --> 00:08:37.815]  Because I've never ever seen, there's never been a response in any sort of a media scrum that I can think of like that on a live set ever.
[00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:41.116]  I mean, that was unbelievable how they behaved.
[00:08:41.456 --> 00:08:42.236]  Yeah, totally.
[00:08:42.516 --> 00:08:46.937]  And hey, if people out there haven't seen this, I think we have some playlists up on our channel.
[00:08:47.337 --> 00:08:52.158]  But if you go to, I think you talk to the Van Jones interview.
[00:08:53.198 --> 00:08:55.880]  We did a 30-minute interview of Van Jones.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.321]  Actually, Owen did most of the talking.
[00:08:57.721 --> 00:08:59.262]  He shared it on his Facebook, too.
[00:08:59.562 --> 00:08:59.982]  Oh, he did?
[00:09:00.002 --> 00:09:05.286]  I find that surprising, but he didn't do that bad.
[00:09:05.986 --> 00:09:07.547]  I've kind of changed my opinion of Van Jones.
[00:09:07.567 --> 00:09:09.929]  Van Jones vs. Carl the Cuxslayer Ultimate Street Debate.
[00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:10.689]  324,000 views right there.
[00:09:10.729 --> 00:09:11.630]  A 31-minute debate in the hot sun.
[00:09:15.732 --> 00:09:23.957]  Alright, and I do think you won though, because at the end Van Jones was so flabbergasted he left his bag, his CNN bag, with all of his stuff.
[00:09:24.237 --> 00:09:24.837]  He forgot it.
[00:09:25.317 --> 00:09:26.358]  That's a good point.
[00:09:26.978 --> 00:09:29.560]  I did woozy him enough that he left his bag there.
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.642]  And I think, you know, honestly, it was more of an interview.
[00:09:33.662 --> 00:09:35.703]  There was kind of some debate going on.
[00:09:36.804 --> 00:09:39.766]  But more than anything, I think what we captured was
[00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:41.748]  A real person.
[00:09:41.768 --> 00:09:42.168]  Yeah.
[00:09:42.468 --> 00:09:46.693]  And I still say from watching Van Jones on TV, that's just, it's just a different guy.
[00:09:46.713 --> 00:09:55.964]  I can't really put my finger on it, but there were some things that Van Jones said in the street that I got him to say that you know
[00:09:57.577 --> 00:10:00.299]  He would never be allowed to say on the mainstream news, ever.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.120]  Right.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:07.825]  Especially when he was like, when I brought up the hands up don't shoot, and he basically took a second and said, we rush to conclusions.
[00:10:08.526 --> 00:10:11.889]  I mean, he basically admits, yeah, we run with false narratives.
[00:10:12.009 --> 00:10:13.991]  I mean, that's a kind of, I mean...
[00:10:14.651 --> 00:10:18.373]  Maybe he meant that, maybe he didn't, but that's also another way that you could look at him saying that.
[00:10:18.894 --> 00:10:30.181]  But I think that it was a very powerful moment that shows that the left and the right can be brought together on issues, even if it's someone as extreme left as Van Jones and as extreme right as me.
[00:10:30.981 --> 00:10:34.724]  And he said at the end of that, one thing we have to do is come together and talk.
[00:10:35.484 --> 00:10:37.485]  And that's right, and that's something that we do a lot of.
[00:10:37.805 --> 00:10:47.568]  You've done it, you've proven it time and time again that you go out there and talk, you don't degrade people, but you challenge them with ideas and facts, and you're very quick to come back.
[00:10:47.608 --> 00:10:50.709]  So right now, at this moment in time right here, it's at 3.29 Central Time.
[00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:54.391]  I've talked with Alex.
[00:10:54.411 --> 00:10:55.711]  We're going to offer you a job.
[00:10:55.852 --> 00:11:00.074]  We're going to fly you down here and give you the interview and do everything.
[00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:02.216]  I just want to do it right here live on the air.
[00:11:03.056 --> 00:11:06.619]  We'd love to have you out here and I think there's definitely a place for you here in the Infowars family.
[00:11:07.475 --> 00:11:10.237]  Well, I don't know if you can tell that I'm blushing right now.
[00:11:10.418 --> 00:11:12.299]  I'm a little sunburnt from the pool yesterday.
[00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:24.389]  But, you know, when I woke up from my sheeple state and I found InfoWars, I can't tell you how much of a dream it is.
[00:11:24.489 --> 00:11:27.131]  And it's because you guys are the tip of the spear.
[00:11:27.452 --> 00:11:29.794]  And like you said, man, I want to be the tip of the spear.
[00:11:29.854 --> 00:11:31.815]  I want to engage in debate.
[00:11:31.895 --> 00:11:33.597]  I want to awaken humanity.
[00:11:33.897 --> 00:11:35.478]  People are so powerful.
[00:11:35.818 --> 00:11:41.082]  If they just knew how much power they had, we could make the world a better place in a heartbeat.
[00:11:41.482 --> 00:11:42.643]  And I'll tell you a little secret.
[00:11:42.843 --> 00:11:47.407]  At the end of that 31-minute interview, I turned the camera to you and I said, close it out.
[00:11:47.967 --> 00:11:51.690]  And you closed it out and you ended with, this is Owen Schreyer for Infowars.com.
[00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:59.635]  And that to me said, you were the right person for this job because even after 30 minutes in the hot sun, you still remember to say your name and who you work for.
[00:12:00.976 --> 00:12:02.399]  And you don't even work for us at the time.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.963]  You were just like, boom, you're in the zone.
[00:12:04.003 --> 00:12:04.785]  You knew what to say.
[00:12:04.805 --> 00:12:07.611]  Hey, did you even look at the resume I sent you?
[00:12:08.052 --> 00:12:08.934]  Yes, I just looked at it.
[00:12:10.652 --> 00:12:11.773]  I'm qualified, man.
[00:12:11.973 --> 00:12:12.334]  Oh, I know.
[00:12:12.674 --> 00:12:13.595]  You've been doing radio.
[00:12:13.655 --> 00:12:16.557]  You're more than qualified to come in here and do... Here's the thing.
[00:12:16.657 --> 00:12:18.179]  Everybody does a lot of jobs here.
[00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:19.640]  There's not just one job.
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.041]  There's a multitude of jobs.
[00:12:21.281 --> 00:12:23.063]  And you know how to do technical stuff.
[00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:24.504]  You know how to get in front of the camera.
[00:12:25.024 --> 00:12:26.866]  And we're going to make sure you know how to edit and shoot camera.
[00:12:27.226 --> 00:12:31.890]  And let me just say this, because there's a lot of people that know this about me.
[00:12:32.631 --> 00:12:35.854]  Rob, I've been working in sports media for over five years.
[00:12:36.154 --> 00:12:36.674]  You know that.
[00:12:37.455 --> 00:12:44.257]  I've been obsessed with sports my whole life and there were a lot of people that wanted that wanted this moment to come.
[00:12:44.317 --> 00:12:48.778]  They wanted me to finally get out of sports and into news and politics.
[00:12:48.838 --> 00:12:52.299]  So I hope I can't wait to get down there.
[00:12:52.359 --> 00:12:53.999]  I can't wait to see your guys studios.
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.340]  I hope you guys are ready for me.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.640]  I'm planning on bringing the heat.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.081]  I think that your staff wants to bring the heat too.
[00:13:00.241 --> 00:13:02.041]  I can't wait to work with Alex Jones.
[00:13:02.422 --> 00:13:03.702]  It's it's beyond an honor.
[00:13:04.222 --> 00:13:05.982]  And let's sharpen that tip of the spear.
[00:13:06.002 --> 00:13:06.523]  I'm going to get there.
[00:13:06.543 --> 00:13:07.783]  I'm going to sharpen that bad boy.
[00:13:07.983 --> 00:13:08.263]  Good.
[00:13:08.303 --> 00:13:08.983]  That's what I want to hear.
[00:13:09.023 --> 00:13:09.623]  Now stand by.
[00:13:09.663 --> 00:13:11.444]  I've got David Knight waiting in the wings.
[00:13:11.484 --> 00:13:15.865]  But I want you to hang out here for the rest of the hour and pop in if you've got anything to say.
[00:13:15.885 --> 00:13:20.406]  Just kind of raise your hand and they'll let me know that you want to say something.
[00:13:20.426 --> 00:13:21.426]  Elizabeth Warren.
[00:13:21.446 --> 00:13:22.347]  Heil Hitler.
[00:13:22.367 --> 00:13:23.167]  Oh, she did it too.
[00:13:23.207 --> 00:13:24.087]  They caught her doing it.
[00:13:24.187 --> 00:13:24.707]  Amazing.
[00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:25.767]  During her speech.
[00:13:26.688 --> 00:13:29.248]  But you won't hear the left say anything about that.
[00:13:29.548 --> 00:13:32.229]  David Knight, where are you right now in Philadelphia?
[00:13:33.607 --> 00:13:35.710]  David Knight here with the Convention Center.
[00:13:36.651 --> 00:13:41.297]  We're right in front of Barack Obama at the moment.
[00:13:41.357 --> 00:13:42.298]  Of course, he's just there.
[00:13:42.318 --> 00:13:43.379]  He's not photobombing us.
[00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:45.282]  He's actually a standee.
[00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:48.185]  He's pretty much a cardboard cutout of what he is.
[00:13:48.885 --> 00:13:49.265]  That's right.
[00:13:49.765 --> 00:13:55.327]  And of course they're asking, you know, it's interesting we see this narrative about the Russians being behind this leak.
[00:13:55.907 --> 00:13:59.168]  That's what they're trying to push out there to get everybody off of the content.
[00:13:59.188 --> 00:14:03.549]  But I think also to try to attack Trump, try to hang this around him.
[00:14:03.789 --> 00:14:06.390]  Trump called people taco eaters.
[00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.871]  Go ahead.
[00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:10.431]  Yeah, big deal.
[00:14:10.691 --> 00:14:14.012]  Well, you know, the thing is, I was just telling Michael Zimmerman,
[00:14:14.898 --> 00:14:19.824]  If you want to look for a state actor behind these email leaks, I would look at the United States.
[00:14:20.425 --> 00:14:26.393]  Because these are people who just saw Hillary Clinton expose our most vital secrets and get away with it.
[00:14:27.094 --> 00:14:29.436]  Okay, and that was just about a month ago or so.
[00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:39.523]  So I think these people, if they're worth their salt, if they take their job seriously, they would make sure that she's not going to get in the White House, even if she's not going to be going to prison.
[00:14:40.063 --> 00:14:48.589]  And I think if you want to know somebody that's, if it's somebody that's outside of some independent hackers that are working with WikiLeaks, I would look at that place.
[00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:52.732]  But it's interesting, I think, Rob, when we look at the fact that
[00:14:53.567 --> 00:14:55.208]  They're putting out these conspiracy theories.
[00:14:55.248 --> 00:15:04.997]  And of course, we've got conspiracy theories coming from George Will saying, hey, you know, he doesn't want us to see his tax returns because there's probably information in there where he's working with Russian oligarchs.
[00:15:05.017 --> 00:15:06.398]  There's absolutely no evidence of that.
[00:15:06.919 --> 00:15:07.639]  And they point that out.
[00:15:07.919 --> 00:15:16.146]  And yet here they are, floating all these unfounded conspiracy theories that they've always said, hey, you guys are conspiracy theorists, when we question their official narrative.
[00:15:16.387 --> 00:15:20.030]  But here they are putting out a positive narrative for which they have absolutely no proof.
[00:15:20.838 --> 00:15:23.980]  And trying to use that to get everybody diverted.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.021]  I think we ought to call this Watergate 2.0.
[00:15:26.101 --> 00:15:32.044]  You know, they've got their plumbers now who are working on trying to control this leak or trying to control the damage.
[00:15:32.625 --> 00:15:35.406]  And it is very much like Watergate, if you remember.
[00:15:35.686 --> 00:15:37.568]  This is a torrent flood of lies.
[00:15:37.588 --> 00:15:39.008]  This is Torrent Floodgate 2.0.
[00:15:39.068 --> 00:15:40.389]  This isn't even water.
[00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:41.830]  This isn't a trickle.
[00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.272]  This is ridiculous what she's done on so many levels.
[00:15:46.348 --> 00:15:51.056]  It's massive, but I think the parallels, going back to Watergate, are the fact that you had somebody who was running.
[00:15:51.096 --> 00:15:51.997]  I mean, here was Nixon.
[00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:53.019]  He was running for re-election.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.904]  He was in a very strong position.
[00:15:56.708 --> 00:16:05.998]  And yet he was so paranoid, so grasping for power, that he would break into these other places and then create this massive cover-up to try to cover up what he did and so forth and so on.
[00:16:06.478 --> 00:16:12.104]  And we understand the involvement of the CIA and the FBI and the fact that there was evidence of a coup there as well.
[00:16:12.144 --> 00:16:16.168]  So there's a lot of parallels going back to the 1970s to Richard Nixon.
[00:16:16.188 --> 00:16:20.452]  I think especially the fact that she continues to insist that she's not a crook.
[00:16:20.962 --> 00:16:22.205]  When everybody knows that she is.
[00:16:22.265 --> 00:16:26.575]  Everybody knew that Richard Nixon was a crook, even though he kept saying he wasn't.
[00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:31.525]  And I think Hillary Clinton is going to go down in history like another Richard Nixon.
[00:16:32.608 --> 00:16:49.803]  Yeah, I agree, and what's funny is we had the Hillary for Prison banner driving around Independence Square on Monday, and after I would go by, I'd go and ask people what they thought of it, and I had this one guy in the tri-corner hat, and he said, well, they should be putting other people in prison like Nixon.
[00:16:50.183 --> 00:16:51.624]  Well, I'm sorry, Nixon's dead, man.
[00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:53.286]  We've got to work on the criminals now.
[00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.947]  If we don't start somewhere... Yeah, dig him up.
[00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:55.808]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:55.868 --> 00:16:56.969]  Let's dig him up and put him in jail.
[00:16:57.549 --> 00:16:58.610]  If we don't start now...
[00:16:59.911 --> 00:17:01.293]  How are we to say we didn't learn?
[00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:03.496]  That was your generation's fault that you didn't put him in jail.
[00:17:03.516 --> 00:17:04.817]  It's not my fault, okay?
[00:17:05.158 --> 00:17:07.180]  My generation wants to put Hillary Clinton in prison.
[00:17:07.421 --> 00:17:12.407]  And by the way, we now have 20% off all t-shirts if you want to get your Hillary for prison t-shirt.
[00:17:12.747 --> 00:17:15.831]  And you could show it just like that banner that's driving around...
[00:17:16.932 --> 00:17:19.214]  Dallas, Philadelphia right now.
[00:17:19.274 --> 00:17:24.919]  We had it driving around in front of the MSNBC studio in front of Independence Square, triggering people.
[00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:27.080]  I triggered a gun grabber.
[00:17:27.161 --> 00:17:31.965]  This kind of portly man who at the end of the video says he wants to get rid of all guns.
[00:17:32.025 --> 00:17:33.286]  That's what these people think.
[00:17:33.806 --> 00:17:36.728]  These people think guns are the problem, not criminals like Hillary Clinton.
[00:17:36.768 --> 00:17:42.673]  Anything she does is okay because these people have to suspend disbelief in order to get to that point.
[00:17:42.693 --> 00:17:50.578]  So we're right now in the middle of operation, not even in the middle, but in the first five hours, this is the four and a half hours into Operation Sleeping Giant.
[00:17:50.919 --> 00:17:53.400]  It's our super sale and fundraisers going on right now.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:18:00.826]  40% off Brain Force, 20% off all ProPure water filters, 30% off Survival Shield X2, an amazing product.
[00:18:01.767 --> 00:18:05.072]  30% off Supermill and Female Vitality, both amazing products.
[00:18:05.593 --> 00:18:12.443]  20% off all survival seeds, 20% off all shirts, 30% off liver shield, and many, many other specials.
[00:18:13.044 --> 00:18:16.330]  David, what products out of the InfoWars Lifeline do you take?
[00:18:18.376 --> 00:18:20.177]  My favorite is Brain Force.
[00:18:20.257 --> 00:18:23.319]  I call it Brain Focus because it really does help me to focus.
[00:18:24.119 --> 00:18:25.380]  That's one of the products.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:31.744]  I take a lot of products because I look at the back of them and even if I don't feel something, I understand what these ingredients are about.
[00:18:31.764 --> 00:18:34.285]  I understand how they're going to affect my health for the better.
[00:18:34.846 --> 00:18:38.428]  Just like I don't feel anything when I take vitamin C, but I know I need to take vitamin C.
[00:18:39.008 --> 00:18:43.412]  But some of them, like Brain Force, I definitely can tell it focuses me.
[00:18:43.572 --> 00:18:45.593]  Unlike coffee, it doesn't make me jittery.
[00:18:46.214 --> 00:18:49.397]  But it's one of the products that I feel something immediately.
[00:18:49.417 --> 00:18:50.978]  So I would say that's my favorite supplement.
[00:19:01.237 --> 00:19:03.357]  Hillary for President shirts are $19.95.
[00:19:03.398 --> 00:19:04.758]  We've been selling them as low as $5.
[00:19:04.878 --> 00:19:06.358]  I want to get tens of thousands of them out there.
[00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:08.299]  There's like 80,000 of them now out there or something.
[00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:10.179]  They're all over the country.
[00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:11.439]  It's one of the top memes in the nation.
[00:19:11.679 --> 00:19:15.680]  But at $19.95, we can take all the proceeds and pay for aircraft in the skies.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.361]  You've seen that be national news.
[00:19:17.601 --> 00:19:18.981]  You've seen that be the top meme in the country.
[00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:19.521]  It's amazing.
[00:19:20.061 --> 00:19:21.942]  We're leading the way on how to resist.
[00:19:22.582 --> 00:19:23.462]  We're ragtag.
[00:19:23.802 --> 00:19:25.583]  We're cross-eyed and exhausted half the time.
[00:19:25.843 --> 00:19:26.843]  But we've got the passion.
[00:19:26.863 --> 00:19:27.723]  We're going over the top.
[00:19:28.103 --> 00:19:30.944]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:19:31.184 --> 00:19:38.948]  I'm selling at $19.95 to pay for the banners, to pay for the 18-wheelers with the big signs, to pay for the Jumbotron videos, and it's really paying off.
[00:19:38.968 --> 00:19:40.969]  Hundreds of newspapers, TV, Hillary for President.
[00:19:41.569 --> 00:19:45.131]  You cannot, but all the shirts we sell, all the ones we have, it's like $60,000.
[00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:47.752]  So, but we got more being printed right now.
[00:19:47.792 --> 00:19:55.756]  Everybody's got to go buy a Hillary for President shirt for $19.95, show that in full or so you can get on the whole, because I want to really go crazy with airplanes at the DNC.
[00:19:56.096 --> 00:19:57.257]  We're looking at blimps as well.
[00:19:57.677 --> 00:19:58.578]  We're not going to be censored.
[00:19:58.659 --> 00:19:59.820]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.322]  Get your Hillary for President shirts today.
[00:20:01.683 --> 00:20:03.886]  Look in the last eight months how far that meme's come.
[00:20:04.167 --> 00:20:08.293]  In one block that I walked just a minute ago, I saw 15 of those shirts.
[00:20:08.713 --> 00:20:09.735]  Just in one block!
[00:20:10.276 --> 00:20:12.659]  The drive here from my spot where I'm staying.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.001]  30, 40 tons of them.
[00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:17.383]  They're every single winner.
[00:20:17.403 --> 00:20:22.326]  The rally yesterday, almost everyone in the crowd had on a Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:20:22.486 --> 00:20:23.647]  It is amazing.
[00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:27.049]  Everyone stops and they go, what does that shirt mean?
[00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:27.409]  Why?
[00:20:27.489 --> 00:20:28.830]  Why does she need to go to prison?
[00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:35.314]  And it allows us to engage in a conversation and teach these people who have no clue about who Hillary really is.
[00:20:35.874 --> 00:20:37.596]  About all the things she's been involved in.
[00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:38.857]  And we're not laying down to that witch.
[00:20:38.897 --> 00:20:40.418]  She's not, she's not going to buffalo us.
[00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:41.419]  We're not coward.
[00:20:41.439 --> 00:20:42.220]  We're not broke back.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.981]  We're taking action.
[00:20:43.001 --> 00:20:43.501]  What about you?
[00:20:43.802 --> 00:20:44.722]  Get your Hillary for President shirt.
[00:20:44.762 --> 00:20:45.483]  I know you already have one.
[00:20:45.503 --> 00:20:45.944]  Buy another one.
[00:20:46.184 --> 00:20:47.125]  Give it to friends and family.
[00:20:47.465 --> 00:20:50.248]  I'm telling you, the war is now, the war is an info war.
[00:20:50.488 --> 00:20:51.068]  We're going to win.
[00:20:51.569 --> 00:20:54.291]  It's now been duplicated by countless groups and I think that's wonderful.
[00:20:55.273 --> 00:21:02.196]  Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and now it's all over CNN, it's all over Fox, it's all over the Trump rallies, the Hillary rallies.
[00:21:02.556 --> 00:21:09.618]  The number one search term for a week straight, last week, and still continuing, one of the top search terms is, is Hillary going to jail?
[00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.059]  This has been incredibly successful.
[00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:16.701]  Because it shows, despite corporate control, and despite them trying to control the meme,
[00:21:17.341 --> 00:21:19.663]  We've had three versions of the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[00:21:20.183 --> 00:21:23.606]  All of them have been collector's edition and have helped fund the InfoWar.
[00:21:24.186 --> 00:21:26.748]  We now have a third edition in.
[00:21:26.989 --> 00:21:28.310]  The second edition sold out.
[00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:45.223]  It's the same as the last, but on the right shoulder says InfoWars.com, on the back it says InfoWars.com, legalized freedom, be part of history, be part of supporting the InfoWar, be part of meeting like-minded friends and family.
[00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:53.975]  Get your Hillary for Prison 2016 3rd Wave Shirts at InfoWarStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:01.394 --> 00:22:01.874]  Not a group.
[00:22:01.914 --> 00:22:03.314]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:22:03.354 --> 00:22:04.435]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:22:04.695 --> 00:22:05.615]  Why is this so good?
[00:22:05.895 --> 00:22:11.136]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:22:11.216 --> 00:22:24.780]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.200]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.581]  Spreading disease around.
[00:22:28.642 --> 00:22:31.124]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:32.485]  These are all parasites.
[00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:33.646]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:34.687]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:22:34.987 --> 00:22:39.330]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:22:39.531 --> 00:22:42.693]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:22:42.713 --> 00:22:45.876]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:22:45.916 --> 00:22:46.917]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:22:46.957 --> 00:22:47.477]  Living Defense.
[00:22:47.777 --> 00:22:48.838]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:48.898 --> 00:22:49.919]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:22:49.939 --> 00:22:51.961]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:22:53.523 --> 00:22:54.505]  You support the broadcast.
[00:22:54.565 --> 00:22:55.648]  Infowarslives.com.
[00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:57.814]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:22:58.175 --> 00:23:00.160]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:23:07.208 --> 00:23:09.789]  The vitriol has gotten worse since I left.
[00:23:09.849 --> 00:23:11.771]  I left on early Tuesday morning.
[00:23:12.031 --> 00:23:13.231]  Tuesday night was crazy.
[00:23:13.311 --> 00:23:14.892]  I imagine tonight's going to be crazy.
[00:23:14.952 --> 00:23:20.735]  We're going to get that perspective from Joe Biggs in just one second because he is live out at a media tent.
[00:23:21.296 --> 00:23:27.519]  There must be some big... It looks like some sort of Castro in training is up there probably telling us how to act and what to say.
[00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:30.801]  Rosario Dawson's about to walk up and speak.
[00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:32.562]  Oh yeah?
[00:23:32.602 --> 00:23:34.142]  Is she gonna tell us how to vote too?
[00:23:34.182 --> 00:23:35.103]  We gotta be with Hillary?
[00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:36.364]  She's behind the girl in the hat.
[00:23:36.384 --> 00:23:37.364]  No, no, they're all against.
[00:23:37.584 --> 00:23:38.645]  They're all not gonna vote.
[00:23:38.665 --> 00:23:40.365]  They're all pissed off because of Bernie.
[00:23:40.405 --> 00:23:41.186]  They're all walkouts.
[00:23:41.806 --> 00:23:43.227]  Oh, so these are walkout delegates.
[00:23:43.247 --> 00:23:43.987]  Well, this is good.
[00:23:44.627 --> 00:23:46.748]  Hey, are you gonna go confront the spitter after this?
[00:23:47.889 --> 00:23:50.210]  Uh, you know I am.
[00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:54.012]  You gotta ask him, did your mother teach you to spit on people you don't like?
[00:23:55.292 --> 00:23:57.133]  Because people don't like it when you talk about their mothers.
[00:23:57.153 --> 00:23:58.374]  But spitting on people's okay.
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.021]  And why did the Young Turks edit that out of their video that they showed?
[00:24:03.281 --> 00:24:07.943]  Because that's a big deal, that they edited that out and then pretended like they were assaulted.
[00:24:08.803 --> 00:24:11.944]  Well, we might even be able to do this live, so... Yeah!
[00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:12.845]  Yeah, we might.
[00:24:12.905 --> 00:24:14.645]  In fact, that would be great if we could do it live.
[00:24:14.665 --> 00:24:16.486]  Do you have two cameras running or just one?
[00:24:17.206 --> 00:24:18.446]  I've got my personal camera.
[00:24:18.466 --> 00:24:20.627]  I'm taking pictures with Rosario Dawson's device.
[00:24:21.147 --> 00:24:24.949]  I would say run video of that while you confront that guy when that happens.
[00:24:25.189 --> 00:24:26.989]  And a girl who is big for burning.
[00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:28.870]  And then voice sensor.
[00:24:29.212 --> 00:24:33.713]  So Rosario Dawson's an actress, like a mid-level actress, and Susan Sarandon's pissed off.
[00:24:33.793 --> 00:24:34.374]  She left.
[00:24:34.494 --> 00:24:35.394]  She said, I'm out.
[00:24:35.534 --> 00:24:36.894]  I'm done with the Democratic Party.
[00:24:37.895 --> 00:24:47.738]  She was a Demi, she was a Democrat, a big fan of Bernie Sanders, and she spoke, I think, on Monday night, or Sunday night, actually, and she left.
[00:24:48.778 --> 00:24:49.758]  Oh, hey, Jimmy's over here.
[00:24:49.778 --> 00:24:51.479]  He's down on the, he's walked away.
[00:24:51.499 --> 00:24:51.859]  I'm gonna walk him.
[00:24:51.899 --> 00:24:52.379]  Alright, go get him.
[00:24:52.399 --> 00:24:52.779]  Go get him.
[00:24:53.519 --> 00:24:58.161]  Alright, so this is the guy that spit on Alex Jones when we were over at the Young Turks media tent.
[00:24:59.167 --> 00:25:00.348]  So Joe Biggs is going to confirm.
[00:25:00.368 --> 00:25:00.969]  Go for it Joe.
[00:25:01.009 --> 00:25:02.150]  Just go when you're ready.
[00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:02.770]  I'll shut up.
[00:25:03.211 --> 00:25:04.472]  I'm just describing some people.
[00:25:04.752 --> 00:25:05.152]  Setting it up.
[00:25:05.192 --> 00:25:05.432]  Go.
[00:25:05.512 --> 00:25:05.693]  Go.
[00:25:05.733 --> 00:25:06.373]  Joe Biggs live.
[00:25:07.134 --> 00:25:08.575]  Hey, does your mom teach you how to spit?
[00:25:09.236 --> 00:25:10.897]  Where'd you learn how to spit on people, Jimmy?
[00:25:10.937 --> 00:25:13.920]  Hey, where'd you learn that spitting technique at?
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.162]  Do you always spit on people when you disagree with them?
[00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:23.968]  Is that something you normally do?
[00:25:23.988 --> 00:25:24.709]  You go spit on people?
[00:25:26.283 --> 00:25:26.423]  Huh?
[00:25:26.443 --> 00:25:26.884]  How you doing?
[00:25:27.144 --> 00:25:27.364]  I'm good.
[00:25:27.384 --> 00:25:27.905]  How you doing?
[00:25:28.185 --> 00:25:28.585]  That's nice.
[00:25:28.625 --> 00:25:29.286]  That's a nice sticky guy.
[00:25:29.306 --> 00:25:29.606]  Yeah, cool.
[00:25:29.646 --> 00:25:29.786]  You?
[00:25:29.926 --> 00:25:30.327]  How are you?
[00:25:30.827 --> 00:25:31.088]  I'm good.
[00:25:31.108 --> 00:25:31.528]  How are you, man?
[00:25:31.548 --> 00:25:32.048]  Come on with me.
[00:25:32.289 --> 00:25:33.630]  Yeah, let's go over here.
[00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.090]  Talk to him.
[00:25:35.111 --> 00:25:39.015]  This is the guy that spit on... He's like a low-level minion of the Young Turks.
[00:25:39.596 --> 00:25:41.658]  And he believes spitting on people... Watch out.
[00:25:41.678 --> 00:25:42.799]  He might be going for his tea.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.801]  You're not going for your tea, are you?
[00:25:46.282 --> 00:25:47.323]  Just a little honesty.
[00:25:48.015 --> 00:25:48.635]  What's your name, brother?
[00:25:48.736 --> 00:25:50.637]  Hey, I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:25:50.697 --> 00:25:51.397]  Hey, Joe, how are you?
[00:25:51.737 --> 00:25:52.998]  I'm doing fantastic, actually.
[00:25:53.078 --> 00:25:56.960]  I gotta tell you, Alex Jones is fucking funny, and you know it.
[00:25:57.281 --> 00:25:58.481]  He is funny, right?
[00:25:58.501 --> 00:25:59.482]  You agree with me?
[00:25:59.542 --> 00:26:01.063]  Oh, I think he's a great guy.
[00:26:01.083 --> 00:26:02.484]  I mean, he's actually funny, though.
[00:26:02.524 --> 00:26:03.725]  Ask him if he deserved to be spit on.
[00:26:03.745 --> 00:26:04.045]  He's funny.
[00:26:04.245 --> 00:26:05.406]  Ask him if he deserved to be spit on.
[00:26:05.426 --> 00:26:06.446]  But why would you spit, though?
[00:26:06.466 --> 00:26:07.047]  Come on, brother.
[00:26:07.067 --> 00:26:07.727]  Why would you spit?
[00:26:07.747 --> 00:26:08.107]  How you doing?
[00:26:08.668 --> 00:26:11.469]  When I was going up there, he said something.
[00:26:11.569 --> 00:26:12.170]  I think he said,
[00:26:13.889 --> 00:26:15.170]  He said, hey, I'm trying to be nice.
[00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:16.670]  And it was so funny.
[00:26:18.111 --> 00:26:23.793]  And it was so funny that I did a spook tape, which to me is the highest compliment you could give to another comedian.
[00:26:24.133 --> 00:26:25.393]  And so that's what I was really doing.
[00:26:25.453 --> 00:26:27.774]  And so mad, mad respect to Alex Jones.
[00:26:28.234 --> 00:26:29.615]  So really, no kidding.
[00:26:29.895 --> 00:26:30.575]  Have him contact me.
[00:26:30.595 --> 00:26:32.276]  We could do a thing together.
[00:26:32.296 --> 00:26:33.136]  Good to talk to you, Joe.
[00:26:33.176 --> 00:26:33.676]  Anything else?
[00:26:34.477 --> 00:26:36.518]  So what do you think about this election process?
[00:26:36.538 --> 00:26:37.178]  Who are you going for?
[00:26:37.198 --> 00:26:38.318]  Who am I going for?
[00:26:38.338 --> 00:26:42.060]  Certainly not Hillary Clinton and certainly not Donald Trump.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:42.740]  So you're following the
[00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:44.778]  The Jill Stein now?
[00:26:45.572 --> 00:26:45.952]  You know what?
[00:26:46.052 --> 00:26:46.452]  I don't know.
[00:26:46.472 --> 00:26:46.932]  You know what?
[00:26:46.952 --> 00:26:50.293]  I saw her speak for the first time yesterday and two days ago.
[00:26:50.713 --> 00:26:51.713]  She gave a really good speech.
[00:26:52.433 --> 00:26:56.074]  And you know, there's a couple of things on her platform I don't agree with either.
[00:26:56.614 --> 00:26:58.974]  But I don't see I can give my vote to corruption.
[00:26:59.014 --> 00:27:02.595]  You know, Debbie, Debbie Wasserman just got kicked out for being corrupt and immediately she got hired.
[00:27:02.615 --> 00:27:04.815]  So what do you think about that, though, with the DNC leaks?
[00:27:05.015 --> 00:27:06.196]  How the DNC leaks have come out.
[00:27:06.516 --> 00:27:09.956]  It shows the collusion between the mainstream media.
[00:27:09.976 --> 00:27:10.576]  No shit, I'm with you.
[00:27:10.596 --> 00:27:11.957]  And Debbie Wasserman.
[00:27:11.977 --> 00:27:12.517]  No, you're fine.
[00:27:12.877 --> 00:27:13.157]  And then...
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.584]  Hillary Clinton brings her in as an honorary chairman of her campaign.
[00:27:17.604 --> 00:27:18.806]  Dude, that's ridiculous, right?
[00:27:18.847 --> 00:27:20.269]  That's like, oh, so you're corrupt.
[00:27:20.309 --> 00:27:21.070]  We have to fire you.
[00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.574]  But we're going to hire you onto my campaign and I'm going to be president.
[00:27:23.755 --> 00:27:24.977]  That's horrible.
[00:27:25.037 --> 00:27:26.640]  That's what I think this is about a little bit.
[00:27:27.136 --> 00:27:30.337]  It was more about Nina Turner not being allowed to speak, so people are upset about that.
[00:27:30.657 --> 00:27:34.958]  So they're totally disrespecting the real liberals, right, in the party, and that's the big problem, right?
[00:27:34.998 --> 00:27:39.079]  So people are upset that the Democratic Party's moved to the right, and they're corporatists.
[00:27:39.139 --> 00:27:41.559]  Ask her if Anna's gonna apologize for fat-shaming Alex.
[00:27:41.719 --> 00:27:47.481]  And you know if Anna Kasparyan's gonna apologize for fat-shaming, isn't she like the big anti-fat-shaming person?
[00:27:48.501 --> 00:27:49.321]  She fat-shamed Alex.
[00:27:50.089 --> 00:27:53.292]  You know, uh, Jax is going through some pizza boxes.
[00:27:53.952 --> 00:27:57.054]  But, uh, no, I don't know what Dana... I don't know what Alex is going to say.
[00:27:57.555 --> 00:28:00.057]  But mad props to Alex for being funny.
[00:28:00.097 --> 00:28:05.661]  And I don't know if you... I actually went on YouTube, and there's a whole series of Alex Jones hilarious videos.
[00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:06.482]  You've seen those, right?
[00:28:06.862 --> 00:28:07.402]  And he is!
[00:28:08.103 --> 00:28:09.084]  I'm not kidding, by the way.
[00:28:09.524 --> 00:28:11.085]  I'm not... That's not even a little bit of a joke.
[00:28:11.585 --> 00:28:13.507]  I'm being humorous, but it's serious.
[00:28:14.187 --> 00:28:18.511]  And then, um, after the spit take, he goes, um... He says, hey, that guy spit in my face for no reason.
[00:28:19.329 --> 00:28:20.191]  Which is also funny.
[00:28:20.291 --> 00:28:21.955]  That's like a biohazard.
[00:28:21.995 --> 00:28:22.617]  No, no, no.
[00:28:22.657 --> 00:28:23.298]  It wasn't spit.
[00:28:23.358 --> 00:28:24.040]  I wouldn't spit.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.804]  But it was in your mouth!
[00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:28.190]  I don't know where you've been.
[00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.530]  It was involuntary.
[00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.051]  Alex is hilarious.
[00:28:31.071 --> 00:28:32.332]  How do you involuntarily spit?
[00:28:32.352 --> 00:28:32.732]  Spit take.
[00:28:33.332 --> 00:28:34.413]  You know what a spit take is.
[00:28:34.513 --> 00:28:35.113]  Come on, Joe.
[00:28:35.633 --> 00:28:36.254]  Oh my god.
[00:28:36.274 --> 00:28:37.154]  Come on, man.
[00:28:37.194 --> 00:28:37.554]  You know what?
[00:28:37.654 --> 00:28:42.136]  I would like Alex... We should set it up that he could spit while I see it in my face if he would like.
[00:28:42.156 --> 00:28:44.377]  Okay, I think we can do that.
[00:28:44.417 --> 00:28:44.718]  I'm serious.
[00:28:44.738 --> 00:28:45.998]  That would be okay with me.
[00:28:46.018 --> 00:28:46.358]  Alright, man.
[00:28:46.378 --> 00:28:46.839]  Alright, Tom, thanks.
[00:28:46.859 --> 00:28:47.139]  Tom, thanks.
[00:28:47.199 --> 00:28:48.199]  Nice to talk to you, Joe.
[00:28:48.239 --> 00:28:48.819]  Alex is funny.
[00:28:48.839 --> 00:28:49.640]  Alright, buddy.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:57.483]  I think he just wanted you to say Alex actually does have a great sense of humor and we've done a lot of funny skits around here that I think are hilarious.
[00:28:57.943 --> 00:29:01.964]  So Joe, what have you seen today going on, especially after last night?
[00:29:02.004 --> 00:29:05.445]  Last night looked a lot crazier than Monday night, let me tell you.
[00:29:06.546 --> 00:29:11.808]  Last night was definitely interesting because you had two different factions, you had two different groups playing out.
[00:29:11.848 --> 00:29:18.930]  There was a large Black Lives Matter protest that was in the thousands and they started north broad
[00:29:21.368 --> 00:29:21.528]  Yes.
[00:29:43.069 --> 00:29:45.570]  The video, the footage, it's been out everywhere on Judge Report.
[00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:50.573]  This lady clearly gets up on the vehicle with a bullhorn and says, if you're white, you get the back of the march.
[00:29:50.593 --> 00:29:51.834]  You don't belong up front with us.
[00:29:52.314 --> 00:29:54.555]  And then they marched all the way down to City Hall.
[00:29:54.895 --> 00:30:05.861]  Well, it started dying down, and I ended up taking an Uber further south to FDR Park, where there was a Bernie Sanders rally of people who were very angry about the entire DNC leaks.
[00:30:06.201 --> 00:30:14.665]  And they were voicing their opinion about that, and they were talking about how they wanted to get over that wall and get inside and support the delegates when they walk out.
[00:30:15.205 --> 00:30:28.211]  So, I actually have footage of some of these Bernie Sanders supporters actually climbing this fence to get into the Wells Fargo Center, where the DNC was taking place, trying to get out there, and it was quickly shut down, they were arrested.
[00:30:28.531 --> 00:30:30.932]  But there were thousands of people in that protest.
[00:30:32.072 --> 00:30:33.113]  Hours or so goes by,
[00:30:33.883 --> 00:30:43.452]  And the protest down south starts marching north, and they actually end up running into the Black Lives Matter protest under a bridge at Packer Avenue, where there were about six squad cars.
[00:30:44.403 --> 00:30:47.925]  At that point in time, they started screaming, hey, let's join forces together.
[00:30:47.945 --> 00:30:50.166]  Let's march back down towards the DNC.
[00:30:50.646 --> 00:30:53.447]  And in that moment, they started pushing the squad cars back.
[00:30:53.807 --> 00:30:59.530]  And there was like this epic battle between the police inside the vehicles, the protesters.
[00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:03.572]  They were banging on the hoods of the cars, complete and total anarchy, chaos.
[00:31:03.672 --> 00:31:04.412]  It was nuts.
[00:31:05.213 --> 00:31:07.854]  Yeah, and if you guys can find that footage, it's from last night.
[00:31:08.114 --> 00:31:10.295]  And what are the titles of those videos, Joe?
[00:31:11.286 --> 00:31:13.609]  Uh, it was protesters become more dangerous.
[00:31:13.689 --> 00:31:17.455]  I believe it's got around 50,000 views, 40 something thousand views.
[00:31:17.596 --> 00:31:17.836]  Yeah.
[00:31:18.357 --> 00:31:22.183]  Uh, there was one, there was a 19 year old, uh, guy named Joey.
[00:31:24.721 --> 00:31:33.644]  He was running around talking to the leftists about globalism and how that's a huge danger and how they need to be aware of globalism and what it is and what they can do to look for it and how they can combat it.
[00:31:33.944 --> 00:31:35.364]  And that was his entire thing.
[00:31:35.384 --> 00:31:37.625]  He told his mom, hey, this means something to me.
[00:31:37.725 --> 00:31:39.085]  I'm going out here with the protesters.
[00:31:39.165 --> 00:31:39.745]  I'll be fine.
[00:31:40.125 --> 00:31:52.209]  You know, his main goal was to get on InfoWars and talk about his message that he was teaching to the left and let them understand that, you know, maybe the Bernie Sanders supporters and the Trump supporters have a little bit more in common than they think.
[00:31:53.257 --> 00:31:56.560]  Yeah, I definitely agree, especially Bernie supporters.
[00:31:58.081 --> 00:32:05.587]  Donald Trump is not part of the political establishment that we see, that has been running the show for the last 30-40 years.
[00:32:06.547 --> 00:32:12.052]  That paradigm is changing, and it's changing because of the internet, and people are starting to get real to what's happening.
[00:32:12.512 --> 00:32:15.414]  They're not getting their news from mainstream media anymore.
[00:32:15.694 --> 00:32:16.355]  That's dying.
[00:32:16.915 --> 00:32:19.337]  Mainstream media is being watched by people who are 60 and over.
[00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:21.359]  And that's it.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.761]  Nobody else gets their news from mainstream media.
[00:32:23.781 --> 00:32:24.421]  They don't care.
[00:32:26.322 --> 00:32:31.326]  Your grandmother gets her news from... Rachel Maddow tells all!
[00:32:31.346 --> 00:32:34.027]  Rachel Maddow tells all!
[00:32:34.087 --> 00:32:37.389]  Sometimes it's hard to go over there, but we love our Grammy.
[00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:45.154]  I'm still curious whether or not Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes are two people or one and the same and they just decide to change.
[00:32:45.314 --> 00:32:46.355]  I think they change classes.
[00:32:47.435 --> 00:32:50.299]  Well no, they change glasses and Rachel shaves before they go on.
[00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:59.071]  It's a gender, maybe it's like a gender identification, the confusion issue where one day they're a guy, one day they're a girl, they don't know, they're really confused still about it.
[00:32:59.391 --> 00:32:59.771]  I don't know.
[00:33:02.515 --> 00:33:08.003]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.543 --> 00:33:09.044]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.445 --> 00:33:16.454]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula 30 Servings Fruit Punch Flavor Dietary Supplement.
[00:33:16.755 --> 00:33:17.816]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.876 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!
[00:35:55.418 --> 00:35:59.441]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.687]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.027 --> 00:36:46.689]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.889 --> 00:36:53.011]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:57.053]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:37:09.625 --> 00:37:19.908]  George Norrie is somebody, because I later was told this by Clear Channel Executives, he probably doesn't want me telling this story, or he can tell me it's inaccurate, but I was told this by some honorable folks that later left the company just a few years ago.
[00:37:20.808 --> 00:37:23.229]  He put his job on the line in 2003.
[00:37:23.749 --> 00:37:31.532]  He had a top-rated show, he'd won TV, you know, his highest credits, Emmys, three of them or four of them.
[00:37:32.432 --> 00:37:35.354]  He's been, of course, a naval officer and he's done a lot of other amazing things.
[00:37:35.594 --> 00:37:38.556]  And he was being, you know, taken over the show and took it from 500 stations over 600.
[00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:41.278]  It'll be the second largest syndicated show in the world.
[00:37:42.018 --> 00:37:43.900]  That's on at night, so it beats the daytime shows.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.101]  Don't talk about his courage, though, as a trailblazer.
[00:37:46.121 --> 00:37:52.566]  He took the show from 80% UFOs, which is interesting, to like 80% New World Order, world governments, you know, vaccinations are dangerous.
[00:37:53.366 --> 00:37:54.467]  And he put his job on the line.
[00:37:54.487 --> 00:38:00.151]  And I happen to know for a fact that I don't think I've ever even told him this story, but when he finally set me up for the show, we had record ratings.
[00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:01.992]  It was on national TV the next day that they had me on.
[00:38:02.792 --> 00:38:12.255]  C-SPAN, CNN reported on, they were very scared of it, that, you know, there were people telling me, look, they're wanting George to fail.
[00:38:12.635 --> 00:38:16.136]  Some people, they're doing this and they think that this is how they're going to bring him down.
[00:38:16.156 --> 00:38:18.917]  He'd only been on the show a year and a half and had taken it to the highest ratings ever.
[00:38:19.817 --> 00:38:24.658]  And they had a replacement host ready and George Norrie said, I'm putting Alex Jones on the air.
[00:38:25.618 --> 00:38:26.218]  And you know what?
[00:38:26.499 --> 00:38:28.499]  It's the chain reaction that led to so much of this.
[00:38:28.779 --> 00:38:31.180]  And then Matt Drudge, a whole other level, DrudgeReport.com.
[00:38:31.963 --> 00:38:34.325]  And look, it's not about thanking people that helped me.
[00:38:34.425 --> 00:38:39.449]  They were patriots a decade ago or more when no one would talk about this.
[00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:42.512]  You'd get audited, you'd get arrested, you'd get beat up.
[00:38:43.436 --> 00:38:45.817]  I used to get audited and beat up in parking lots for this stuff.
[00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:52.200]  And so, George, you know, I love you, brother, and it's always good seeing you, and I hate to kiss your butt, but people need to know how amazing you are.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:58.422]  You know, it's not just Donald Trump today, or Ron Paul, or any of these people, or Nigel Farage.
[00:38:58.542 --> 00:38:59.203]  You went through a lot.
[00:38:59.223 --> 00:39:03.124]  Now, I know you know part of this story, but over the years I got the full story from different levels.
[00:39:04.165 --> 00:39:07.026]  I mean, were you threatened like I was before I came on?
[00:39:08.174 --> 00:39:10.695]  I was never threatened, Alex, directly.
[00:39:10.835 --> 00:39:14.837]  It always came to me by word of mouth from other people.
[00:39:15.697 --> 00:39:18.958]  And, you know, they kept, like, dodging the bullet.
[00:39:19.558 --> 00:39:25.060]  We were never able to hone down and find out exactly who are they, what are they.
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.481]  But they kept coming at me in different ways.
[00:39:27.621 --> 00:39:29.282]  But, you know, we kept fighting.
[00:39:29.302 --> 00:39:32.043]  And we did exactly what you said.
[00:39:32.063 --> 00:39:35.864]  We took a show that was successful and popular.
[00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:42.491]  That would not have continued in this society today had I not made the changes that I had to make.
[00:39:42.511 --> 00:39:44.012]  You are a total visionary.
[00:39:45.152 --> 00:39:45.652]  Had to do it.
[00:39:46.672 --> 00:39:47.153]  Had to do it.
[00:39:47.173 --> 00:39:49.893]  Well, you know, George, George, anything I can ever do for you.
[00:39:49.913 --> 00:39:54.014]  I mean, I want you to know how much I admire you in this in this world of cowards.
[00:39:54.054 --> 00:39:55.295]  You are such a frickin' man.
[00:39:56.775 --> 00:39:58.335]  Well, you already do, my friend.
[00:39:58.375 --> 00:40:01.896]  You've been very helpful to my family and you're one heck of a guy.
[00:40:02.516 --> 00:40:04.257]  And we think the world of you.
[00:40:04.437 --> 00:40:05.397]  And I'm telling you,
[00:40:06.607 --> 00:40:14.054]  The best thing I ever did in this show was sticking my neck out, putting Alex Jones on our radio show.
[00:40:15.075 --> 00:40:24.243]  Because we prove to the people that there's more to what's going on in this life than just strange and unusual things.
[00:40:24.323 --> 00:40:27.967]  And you care so much, I'm going to go further, because George, you're holding back here, okay, but I know everything.
[00:40:28.387 --> 00:40:30.269]  You helped get me on XM and Sirius.
[00:40:32.953 --> 00:40:34.756]  Your ability got you on.
[00:40:34.936 --> 00:40:41.225]  No, I know, but you met with the presidents and the people and jumped through the hoops, even though I've never put other people's shows on.
[00:40:41.245 --> 00:40:43.408]  They did that because there were some patriots there.
[00:40:43.428 --> 00:40:44.569]  So I just want to commend you, man.
[00:40:45.811 --> 00:40:48.194]  Look, George, I know everything you did, and I appreciate you.
[00:40:49.131 --> 00:40:49.971]  That's okay, my friend.
[00:41:08.118 --> 00:41:09.119]  Water filters and stuff like that.
[00:41:09.279 --> 00:41:15.703]  But tell me about your view of Donald Trump, the world events, the crossroads, the Democratic Party, the emails.
[00:41:16.023 --> 00:41:16.903]  I mean, what's front and center?
[00:41:16.923 --> 00:41:20.005]  What's coming up on Coast to Coast AM tonight at midnight Central?
[00:41:20.065 --> 00:41:22.327]  It's 10 p.m.
[00:41:22.347 --> 00:41:22.807]  Pacific.
[00:41:23.507 --> 00:41:29.911]  We've got lots going on Coast to Coast tonight, but we start with our round robin of the world events, Alex.
[00:41:30.472 --> 00:41:35.915]  I've got a correspondent at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.
[00:41:36.555 --> 00:41:36.996]  We've got
[00:41:38.314 --> 00:41:40.415]  People all over the place commenting.
[00:41:40.695 --> 00:41:50.318]  Dr. John Curtis, Howard Bloom, our experts on the primaries are going to be talking and giving reaction as they have during the Republican convention last week.
[00:41:51.138 --> 00:41:54.019]  And then we'll go into our typical coast-to-coast shows.
[00:41:54.059 --> 00:41:54.979]  We'll have some fun.
[00:41:54.999 --> 00:41:57.240]  We're going to talk about metaphysical things.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:06.383]  But I got to tell you, this is the strangest election year for the presidency I have ever seen, ever witnessed in my life.
[00:42:07.264 --> 00:42:10.567]  And we don't endorse on coast-to-coast.
[00:42:10.647 --> 00:42:11.768]  I try not to do that.
[00:42:11.788 --> 00:42:16.553]  I want to bring out all the views, let people make up their own minds who they want.
[00:42:17.014 --> 00:42:19.637]  I'll bring out people who are for Trump and against Trump.
[00:42:19.697 --> 00:42:22.860]  I'll bring out people who are for Hillary and against Hillary.
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.283]  Sure, but I can tell overall you're a libertarian, you're for Trump.
[00:42:26.465 --> 00:42:27.845]  I'm a libertarian generally.
[00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:30.806]  I go right down the middle of the road and I call it the way I see it.
[00:42:30.866 --> 00:42:34.227]  I mean, people were talking about me running for the presidency.
[00:42:34.487 --> 00:42:44.669]  I would have offered the VP slot to Condoleezza Rice and the cabinet would have been made up of libertarians, democrats and republicans.
[00:42:44.689 --> 00:42:44.829]  Sure.
[00:42:44.849 --> 00:42:45.330]  Big ten.
[00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:46.210]  The best people.
[00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:48.270]  I want the best people.
[00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:50.111]  The party bosses don't want unification.
[00:42:50.831 --> 00:42:54.652]  In your gut, George Norrie, coast2coastam.com, who's going to win this election?
[00:42:54.692 --> 00:42:55.212]  I think it's Trump.
[00:42:56.775 --> 00:43:02.199]  Well, you're asking me that today, so I will tell you my feelings based on today.
[00:43:02.219 --> 00:43:10.464]  I will preface it by saying that events can change at any moment, Alex, as we lead up to November 8th.
[00:43:10.504 --> 00:43:17.189]  But if people went into the voting booth today, I think that Donald Trump would be our next president.
[00:43:18.029 --> 00:43:18.450]  I do too.
[00:43:21.678 --> 00:43:22.879]  People want change.
[00:43:23.019 --> 00:43:23.740]  They want change.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.621]  They're tired of the status quo.
[00:43:25.961 --> 00:43:27.763]  Hillary's part of the status quo.
[00:43:28.323 --> 00:43:34.207]  Donald Trump is not, like him or not, for his abilities, what he's done.
[00:43:34.307 --> 00:43:35.468]  People just want to change.
[00:43:36.089 --> 00:43:39.531]  And they're prepared to give this to a guy who's a non-politician.
[00:43:40.192 --> 00:43:44.835]  So, again, if the election were held today, I think Donald would win.
[00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:48.278]  He would probably win by five points, which is pretty good.
[00:43:50.057 --> 00:43:51.538]  I agree with you, and I think it's a lot higher than that.
[00:43:51.558 --> 00:43:54.021]  There's a lot of closeted folks that are scared to say they're for Trump.
[00:43:55.442 --> 00:44:00.907]  Once they're in a booth, an election booth, without any eyes or ears looking at them, we'll see what happens.
[00:44:01.007 --> 00:44:04.110]  However, don't forget black box voting.
[00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:11.737]  These electronic voting machines, we've got to get Bev Harris back on our shows to talk about the possibility of these
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:17.726]  Well, let me give you the big scoop, because I've literally dropped my phone in the sink when you were trying to get me on.
[00:44:17.746 --> 00:44:18.868]  I was at the RNC last week.
[00:44:18.888 --> 00:44:19.669]  I'd love to come on any time.
[00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:24.736]  Roger Stone's been on, but screw it all I did, and you guys were broken for a day and a half.
[00:44:24.776 --> 00:44:26.118]  But seriously, you don't ever miss your show.
[00:44:26.158 --> 00:44:27.359]  Gosh, that's 60 million listeners.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.801]  George, looking at this,
[00:44:30.562 --> 00:44:34.124]  I've talked to Trump people, talked to Roger Stone, and I know you've had on.
[00:44:34.144 --> 00:44:37.765]  Trump thinks they're going to try to steal it, and he's making preparations.
[00:44:37.805 --> 00:44:38.685]  He's going to fight it.
[00:44:39.225 --> 00:44:48.388]  What happens if they try to steal it, like in California where Hillary people met with AP and the superdelegates and decided who would win the day before and just ignored the votes?
[00:44:48.709 --> 00:44:49.949]  I mean, that's even in the news.
[00:44:49.989 --> 00:44:51.850]  This is very, very brazen of them.
[00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:52.630]  What do you think is happening?
[00:44:53.906 --> 00:44:59.988]  If they try to steal it, it will be a disaster of biblical proportions.
[00:45:00.148 --> 00:45:07.510]  Because Donald Trump is not the kind of guy to sit back and get beaten and get slapped around.
[00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:14.132]  And there is incredible suspicions about these voting machines and how they're done.
[00:45:14.152 --> 00:45:15.713]  And we're going to monitor that.
[00:45:15.773 --> 00:45:19.074]  We're going to have Beth Harris on way before November 8th.
[00:45:19.795 --> 00:45:29.183]  We're gonna talk about what she thinks is being done, how it can be stopped, how we can prevent anybody from tampering and tinkering around with our results.
[00:45:29.203 --> 00:45:35.328]  And the reason I like her is she's a hardcore liberal and Democrat, but when Democrats feel she says it, when Republicans feel she says it.
[00:45:36.348 --> 00:45:36.849]  Exactly.
[00:45:37.169 --> 00:45:37.629]  Exactly.
[00:45:37.649 --> 00:45:39.731]  She's very fair at what she does.
[00:45:40.912 --> 00:45:42.834]  Now let's expand on that, George, because
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:45.921]  A lot of people won't stick their necks out.
[00:46:06.618 --> 00:46:07.759]  Putt to the green, right?
[00:46:07.899 --> 00:46:11.182]  Or as they say in golf, they take the easy approach.
[00:46:11.662 --> 00:46:18.267]  I'm the kind of guy, you're the kind of guy to want to smack that ball over a lake to see if we can get on the green in two.
[00:46:19.028 --> 00:46:22.691]  And sometimes we end up hitting it in the water, but you know what?
[00:46:22.791 --> 00:46:24.392]  We're going to get it up there eventually.
[00:46:24.892 --> 00:46:26.433]  And that's what's going on right now.
[00:46:26.614 --> 00:46:28.455]  We don't take the safe approach.
[00:46:29.136 --> 00:46:31.898]  We take the approach that we know will work.
[00:46:32.478 --> 00:46:35.281]  And we'll help the people in this country.
[00:46:35.821 --> 00:46:39.144]  And that's the way we've done it all our lives, since we were little kids.
[00:46:39.644 --> 00:46:41.025]  We always experimented.
[00:46:41.105 --> 00:46:43.888]  We always took the most difficult way.
[00:46:44.448 --> 00:46:45.109]  And you know what?
[00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:51.294]  As Robert Frost wrote in his poem, A Road Not Taken, two roads diverged in a yellow wood.
[00:46:51.915 --> 00:46:56.799]  Alex, you and I have gone down that other road that a lot of people don't go down, and I'm glad we did.
[00:46:57.099 --> 00:47:00.462]  God Almighty, I find all the coolest people on that road, George.
[00:47:02.979 --> 00:47:07.963]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.725]  I don't know.
[00:49:09.938 --> 00:49:12.739]  I have been totally blessed to get to meet one of my idols.
[00:49:13.059 --> 00:49:17.280]  Somebody who totally like touched my soul as a young person growing up.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:17.961]  Me too.
[00:49:18.061 --> 00:49:19.141]  It makes me cry.
[00:49:19.161 --> 00:49:19.521]  Back in the 90s.
[00:49:19.541 --> 00:49:25.423]  I went to see his concert and I was just like sobbing and I was like oh my god teenage me is like dying right now.
[00:49:25.743 --> 00:49:26.264]  Right.
[00:49:26.324 --> 00:49:34.690]  But he is very spiritually awake and you know I can kind of text him here and then we've been able to sort of develop a friendship.
[00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:35.551]  Oh that's great.
[00:49:35.851 --> 00:49:51.663]  And so after the world is literally on fire and so I can call him up or text him and say how do I stay in this God space and he can offer totally spiritual insight that's quite refreshing and we've actually got him on the phone now.
[00:49:51.683 --> 00:49:52.204]  Cool.
[00:49:53.005 --> 00:49:54.486]  Mr. Corgan are you there?
[00:49:56.135 --> 00:49:56.215]  Sure.
[00:49:56.235 --> 00:49:57.296]  Awesome.
[00:49:57.416 --> 00:49:58.956]  So I know you were driving.
[00:49:59.076 --> 00:50:00.457]  Are you on the road still?
[00:50:00.777 --> 00:50:01.538]  How are you doing?
[00:50:02.738 --> 00:50:04.319]  I'm on the byways of America.
[00:50:04.359 --> 00:50:04.799]  I'm fine.
[00:50:04.839 --> 00:50:05.460]  Thank you for asking.
[00:50:07.341 --> 00:50:09.722]  So it sounds like we've got a really good connection.
[00:50:09.742 --> 00:50:21.708]  I don't know if you've been able to tune in to any of the show, but we've definitely been kind of going there talking about Atlantis and some different prophecies, things that have been going on in the world, kind of leading in with you.
[00:50:22.668 --> 00:50:48.271]  Just how do we how do we hear as we're fighting this info war and we're looking at these stories every day and we're talking about the prophecies and and how we're just sort of seeing these things manifest and we're seeing the establishment try to gaslight humanity and tell them that they're they're not you know all the craziness and mayhem that you're seeing out there it's not real it's almost kind of
[00:50:48.891 --> 00:50:52.834]  Trying to keep us asleep until they're able to strike.
[00:50:53.314 --> 00:51:04.763]  But how do we look at what's going on in the world and maintain kind of a God consciousness and remember who we truly are in the face of all this fear?
[00:51:04.783 --> 00:51:05.804]  That's a good question.
[00:51:05.824 --> 00:51:08.866]  Well, that's a pretty deep question there.
[00:51:09.147 --> 00:51:10.888]  That's why I lead off with it.
[00:51:14.966 --> 00:51:20.770]  Well, I think you start from the perspective of you have to be able to understand what you're looking at.
[00:51:22.311 --> 00:51:37.463]  And I think, as we talked about the last time I was on, and I got in a bunch of trouble, there's so much going on right now that we're being told not to see what we see.
[00:51:37.483 --> 00:51:41.826]  You know, our natural, instinctual systems will tell us this is dangerous.
[00:51:42.406 --> 00:51:43.327]  This is uncomfortable.
[00:51:44.577 --> 00:51:50.541]  Um, I should have a greater emotional reaction to reading about some terrible thing that happened, and I'm not.
[00:51:50.641 --> 00:51:51.462]  Why am I not?
[00:51:51.902 --> 00:52:00.028]  So I think we have to each kind of check our own self against what we're seeing and experiencing and note where we're not having an appropriate response.
[00:52:01.156 --> 00:52:08.042]  Um, like you and I were talking earlier today, a little bit in preparation for the interview, how ultra-violence is being normalized in our culture.
[00:52:08.062 --> 00:52:14.048]  So literally by the end of the day, we're not even focused anymore on the horrible terrorism thing that happened.
[00:52:14.068 --> 00:52:19.593]  I mean, I heard a statistic today that literally there's a terrorism attack going on every 84 hours now.
[00:52:23.092 --> 00:52:25.314]  Right, and you're right, it's getting normalized.
[00:52:25.654 --> 00:52:29.138]  Like, there was what, four or five attacks in Germany?
[00:52:29.498 --> 00:52:31.520]  Someone's getting hatcheted up with an axe?
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.822]  And then you have the... France.
[00:52:34.262 --> 00:52:45.493]  I don't know, I can't think of the official title now, but basically admonishing the police officers for how dare you shoot that man that was trying to kill you with an axe and just got done.
[00:52:46.073 --> 00:52:56.119]  And then it's like you move on to the next story, the next terrible thing that happens, and the government is telling you, this is the new normal.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:05.785]  You need to get used to this, and oh by the way, we're going to continue opening up the borders, and we know that there's no way to vet this, and what do you think is behind this?
[00:53:07.206 --> 00:53:13.950]  Well, I think it's, I like to keep it kind of in the spiritual side of the conversation, because I think that's sort of more interesting in the moment.
[00:53:15.908 --> 00:53:17.508]  So I want to go back a little bit to what I was saying.
[00:53:18.729 --> 00:53:39.855]  You must be able to see clearly what you're looking at, and if you're hypnotized or propagandized, you are almost incapable of having a correct human or humanistic read to what happens, which is why you see a greater outpouring oftentimes in American culture for things that are terrible,
[00:53:41.468 --> 00:53:44.611]  You know, I think back to the time the boy fell in the hole or something.
[00:53:44.691 --> 00:53:46.532]  They had a, you know, around-the-clock coverage.
[00:53:46.552 --> 00:53:57.061]  I think even the great director Billy Wilder made a movie with Kirk Douglas in the 50s, similar storyline, where a boy falls in a hole and everyone goes crazy trying to save the boy.
[00:53:57.081 --> 00:54:00.184]  We have an easier time
[00:54:01.974 --> 00:54:02.414]  We're good to go.
[00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:51.405]  Yeah, and it seems like there is sort of a concerted effort to kind of confuse people so they can't have the appropriate human response to what's going on around the world.
[00:54:51.885 --> 00:54:56.289]  So we were talking a little bit earlier with Sandeo just sort of about some prophecies
[00:54:57.429 --> 00:55:03.230]  Talk to me a little bit about what you know about maybe this shift in human understanding.
[00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:15.713]  And while some people might not really care about those sort of things, the rulers of this world are quite aware of the more esoteric things going on on the planet, in the universe.
[00:55:15.993 --> 00:55:20.254]  They are quite aware of this shift in human understanding and are possibly
[00:55:20.814 --> 00:55:28.196]  Well, if anyone ever read the very interesting book about the Doors, Jim Morrison, I think it was called No One Here Gets Out Alive.
[00:55:28.216 --> 00:55:34.077]  It came out in the early 80s and it was written by their former manager.
[00:55:44.184 --> 00:55:58.613]  He talked about many things that Jim Morrison was into, but one thing that really stuck out to me as a young person, and I've often thought in terms of playing concerts and being in the audience, is Jim Morrison believed that you could tip a crowd with only about four people in the audience.
[00:55:58.693 --> 00:56:04.997]  But basically, four people planted the audience yelling inappropriate things to get the audience to turn against the band.
[00:56:05.737 --> 00:56:07.058]  So the reason I point this out is,
[00:56:07.638 --> 00:56:20.246]  What you're seeing, and obviously InfoWars is very connected to this concept, what you're seeing is we're reaching a sort of critical mass slash tipping point where you don't have to be aware of everything that's going on.
[00:56:20.286 --> 00:56:25.589]  You only have to be aware that what you've been told your entire life, literally, is not true.
[00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:37.036]  And as the human system in response starts to kick in and say, wait a second, I've been deluded, or this doesn't feel right, and you start actually opening your eyes, for lack of a better symbol,
[00:56:38.028 --> 00:56:40.511]  And recognizing that what you're looking at isn't real.
[00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:47.817]  And you start almost going into a fight or flight response because that is the natural response.
[00:56:47.897 --> 00:56:48.538]  Oh my God!
[00:56:49.519 --> 00:56:51.601]  What I'm looking at is actually not real.
[00:56:52.021 --> 00:57:00.228]  And as you open yourself awareness-wise, however you want to go at it, you begin to go into kind of a response that is in your system.
[00:57:00.569 --> 00:57:01.990]  It's designed to fight or flight.
[00:57:02.675 --> 00:57:09.821]  And Alex oftentimes picks a lot of crap for, you know, kind of losing his mind on the air, you know, going ballistic or whatever.
[00:57:10.641 --> 00:57:19.388]  But he is having an appropriate response to what he's seeing, which is he's overwhelmed by the flight or fight response of what I'm looking at is actually terrifying.
[00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.809]  Right.
[00:57:21.826 --> 00:57:25.549]  And I know that he's had a really awesome rant about that.
[00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:27.671]  He's like, you should be afraid.
[00:57:27.731 --> 00:57:28.692]  You should be angry.
[00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:30.233]  This is crazy.
[00:57:30.273 --> 00:57:39.340]  I mean, this is what I'm looking at the DNC and watching it and just all of, they're basically doing the exact opposite of what they're telling you they're doing on the stage.
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:43.604]  And it's maddening, almost to the point where the cast lighting is working on me.
[00:57:44.144 --> 00:57:50.430]  So we know that they're kind of working with this control energy, massive head game, massive hypnosis.
[00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:51.951]  Keeping us distracted.
[00:57:52.471 --> 00:57:54.372]  How do you find your inner voice?
[00:57:54.432 --> 00:58:04.559]  How do you understand or really connect with what that true guidance is if we haven't even been able to connect with that inner voice for such a long time?
[00:58:04.659 --> 00:58:06.340]  How do you even begin that journey?
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.802]  Well, that's a really difficult question.
[00:58:09.882 --> 00:58:16.186]  Let me let me take one step back because obviously the DNC is going on right now and they have their own version of this.
[00:58:16.206 --> 00:58:20.409]  So this is not a political statement as much as an observation from the standpoint of an entertainer.
[00:58:23.076 --> 00:58:30.239]  You've had the DNC now on for three days, and you've literally had for three days not one mention of the scandal.
[00:58:30.479 --> 00:58:34.181]  Let's say from this stage, but obviously there's a lot going on around the event.
[00:58:34.801 --> 00:58:37.622]  But from this stage, you had no mention of the WikiLeaks hacking.
[00:58:38.703 --> 00:58:48.907]  You've had no mention of Hillary being investigated by the Justice Department and all that, and obviously that was cleared controversially.
[00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:09.935]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.395 --> 00:59:20.123]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.443 --> 00:59:24.186]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.012]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.312 --> 00:59:38.612]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.253 --> 00:59:41.713]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:59:42.093 --> 00:59:47.595]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:59:48.035 --> 00:59:54.705]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
