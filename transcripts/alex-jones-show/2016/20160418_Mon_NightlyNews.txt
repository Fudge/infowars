[00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:22.031]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:26.038]  It is Monday, April 18th, 2016, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.198 --> 00:00:27.260]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.387 --> 00:00:31.828]  Tonight...
[00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:40.732]  Saudi Arabia says it will sell off billions of American assets if questions surrounding 9-11 continue.
[00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:47.778]  Then, a veteran loses child custody over his marijuana PTSD treatment.
[00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:51.701]  After that, the latest from the campaign trail.
[00:00:52.922 --> 00:00:57.746]  And the media chimes in on why Hillary has such bad poll numbers.
[00:00:58.206 --> 00:01:01.608]  What does that mean here and moving forward?
[00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.650]  Well, I think it means she's got something she's got to overcome.
[00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:12.035]  Let me suggest to you, because some of her strategists have said this kind of quietly, it's not really sort of a big thing on the campaign trail, is that a lot of this is sexism.
[00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:15.658]  You know, everybody raises money from all kinds of sources.
[00:01:15.698 --> 00:01:18.079]  She's the one they throw dollar bills at.
[00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.680]  I think there's an element of that.
[00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.483]  It doesn't necessarily play itself out, I think, in the vote.
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:02.873 --> 00:03:03.333]  Governor Bush.
[00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:03.774]  How we doing?
[00:03:03.794 --> 00:03:04.274]  Good to see you, man.
[00:03:04.294 --> 00:03:04.854]  Alright, good, how you doing?
[00:03:05.615 --> 00:03:10.397]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 Commission report?
[00:03:10.417 --> 00:03:11.678]  Would you be willing to see those released?
[00:03:12.478 --> 00:03:13.279]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:14.359]  You got them?
[00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.060]  Well, hopefully we can get them.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.402]  Oh, the Bushes do not want those 28 pages released, but you know what?
[00:03:20.442 --> 00:03:25.845]  Hillary Clinton also will not say whether or not she has seen the 28 pages.
[00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:29.647]  Of course, these are classified, or are they, you know, classified, okay?
[00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:31.127]  According to President Obama.
[00:03:31.487 --> 00:03:40.229]  Now, Hillary was asked twice on Monday whether she has seen the 28 pages and both times she dodged the question.
[00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.030]  She was actually the New York Senator at the time, so this would be something that would be really important to her it seems.
[00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:56.432]  But she dodged the question and she said that the Obama administration should take a hard look at them and determine whether that should be done consistent with national security.
[00:03:57.032 --> 00:03:58.892]  And she also said, I'm not commenting.
[00:03:59.292 --> 00:04:01.494]  When asked, have she read the papers?
[00:04:02.034 --> 00:04:17.027]  Now, she was on a tour with New York Senator Chuckie Schumer at the time, and he has introduced legislation that would allow the families of 9-11 victims to sue the Saudi government if it is found to have contributed to the terrorists.
[00:04:17.808 --> 00:04:19.309]  So very interesting there.
[00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:28.134]  And of course, a couple of weeks ago, Saudi Arabia warned of economic fallout if Congress would dare pass this 9-11 bill.
[00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:41.881]  Saudi Arabia told the Obama administration and members of Congress that, you know, it's just going to be forced to have to sell off hundreds of billions of dollars worth of American assets held by the kingdom if Congress passes this bill.
[00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:43.722]  So making this veiled threat.
[00:04:44.142 --> 00:04:56.474]  Now, the Obama administration has been lobbying Congress to block this bill's passage, and officials have warned senators of diplomatic and economic fallout from this legislation.
[00:04:56.835 --> 00:05:05.083]  So I think it's safe to say that whatever's in those 28 pages is definitely going to be implicating Saudi Arabia.
[00:05:05.663 --> 00:05:12.630]  Now, this New York Times article points out that several outside economists are skeptical that the Saudis are going to follow through.
[00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.532]  They say such a sell-off would be difficult to execute.
[00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:17.875]  It would end up crippling the kingdom's economy.
[00:05:18.555 --> 00:05:28.685]  And now, the administration has argued that this legislation is going to put Americans at legal risk overseas, and they've been lobbying so intently against this 9-11 bill that
[00:05:30.186 --> 00:05:35.689]  It's infuriating lawmakers as well as the families there of the 9-11 victims.
[00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:48.977]  They're saying, once again, the Obama administration is consistently siding with Saudi Arabia, thwarting their efforts to learn what they believe to be the truth about the role that some Saudi officials played in the terrorist plot.
[00:05:49.777 --> 00:05:54.064]  Nothing new there with the Obama administration siding against the American people.
[00:05:54.144 --> 00:06:00.713]  But even if this is an empty threat by Saudi Arabia, even if they really couldn't do it, if it was going to hurt their own economy...
[00:06:01.792 --> 00:06:08.477]  It shows that they're worried about what is in the 28 pages, and in fact, they know that they're going to be held liable.
[00:06:08.878 --> 00:06:29.034]  Now, investigative journalist and Hoover Institution media fellow Paul Sperry was appearing on Breitbart News Daily, and he is the author of Infiltration, How Muslim Spies and Subversives Have Penetrated Washington, and he was on there to discuss all the interviews that he's had with intelligence and law enforcement officers
[00:06:29.534 --> 00:06:30.234]  We're good.
[00:06:49.302 --> 00:06:51.904]  Including, but not limited to, radical mosques.
[00:06:52.325 --> 00:06:59.070]  And he expects the 28 pages will fit neatly with many of the other classified documents that he has been reviewing.
[00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.293]  He says, these 28 pages are explosive.
[00:07:02.653 --> 00:07:05.916]  They name names of individuals complicit in the attacks.
[00:07:06.256 --> 00:07:07.958]  They're all clearly identified.
[00:07:08.258 --> 00:07:14.863]  And the facilitators and handlers for the hijackers, the financiers, and the bag men, they're all identified.
[00:07:14.943 --> 00:07:16.905]  So, you know, are these the officials?
[00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:17.686]  Thank you so much.
[00:07:33.717 --> 00:08:01.024]  But Sperry also points out that it's time to end this suicidal, phony alliance with Saudi Arabia, pointing out that we are sharing intel with them at this very moment, that we are arming them, we're sending them weapon systems, we're rubber stamping all of their student visas, they're still funding jihadists, which we know that, we can see what's happening in the Middle East, they're funding jihadists all around the globe, and they're still building radical mosques here.
[00:08:01.704 --> 00:08:03.825]  Sperry says we've got to stop the madness.
[00:08:04.326 --> 00:08:11.130]  The Saudis are operating a massive counterintelligence program against us right here in America, and we're letting it happen.
[00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:17.935]  And indeed, David Knight has been reporting on several instances of these radical moths and how we're being infiltrated from within.
[00:08:18.735 --> 00:08:23.578]  So definitely some very explosive revelations to be expected with this 28 pages.
[00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:29.602]  And you need to petition to your elected representatives to demand that they read the 28 pages.
[00:08:30.763 --> 00:08:34.884]  Many people who are allowed to actually read the 28 pages haven't even done so.
[00:08:35.264 --> 00:08:38.485]  So you need to make sure that you call your elected representative.
[00:08:38.505 --> 00:08:43.346]  We'll put that website up for you on the screen where you can find out who represents you.
[00:08:43.366 --> 00:08:56.790]  But you need to demand that they read these 28 pages and demand that they be declassified and also push through this legislation that would allow the 9-11 families to sue Saudi Arabia, anyone connected with this.
[00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.030]  This is very important.
[00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:05.495]  But something else, of course, that, you know, Hillary Clinton doesn't want exposed is her global financial network.
[00:09:05.555 --> 00:09:14.941]  And now we can say with the Panama Papers, you know, they had Putin up there, all of his friends, and it was like the big hit piece on Vladimir Putin.
[00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:22.105]  But really, Hillary Clinton has a lot of key financial partners that have been wrapped up in these offshore entities.
[00:09:23.426 --> 00:09:23.927]  They are
[00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:29.229]  Really heavily involved in the Clinton Global Financial Network.
[00:09:29.609 --> 00:09:39.274]  So this includes controversial financiers and foreign entities that have been operating with the infusion of funds from offshore accounts and entities all around the world.
[00:09:39.754 --> 00:09:41.735]  And there are more revelations to come.
[00:09:42.595 --> 00:09:51.560]  The Panama Papers reveal that major Clinton financial partners, including Canadian mining magnate Frank Goustra and another family out of Nigeria.
[00:09:52.121 --> 00:09:55.103]  Goustra is one of the largest contributors to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:09:55.163 --> 00:10:04.948]  He donated more than $25 million, several key figures in the uranium deal that sent 20% of American uranium production into the hands of the Russian government.
[00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:08.911]  They had offshore entities created by Mossack Fonseca.
[00:10:09.731 --> 00:10:18.581]  And of course, as we've reported before, it was that uranium deal that required approval from the Hillary Clinton State Department before it could go forward.
[00:10:19.162 --> 00:10:23.947]  And so nine shareholders in Uranium One sent a combined
[00:10:25.568 --> 00:10:34.911]  $145 million to the Clinton Foundation and what a rubber-stamped uranium and now Russia has 20% of the American uranium.
[00:10:34.931 --> 00:10:35.831]  You know, no big deal.
[00:10:36.212 --> 00:10:44.554]  But another one of Hillary's friends, her little buddies caught up in the Panama Papers, is Brazil's impeached president Dilma Rousseff.
[00:10:44.934 --> 00:10:47.835]  This was a woman who Hillary Clinton previously claimed
[00:10:48.275 --> 00:10:48.795]  We're good to go.
[00:11:09.948 --> 00:11:32.739]  So this is someone, she obviously has a very keen sense of someone who is just the paragon of virtue here, because as the Panama Papers detail, Rousseff was involved in a scheme that used upwards of $26 billion in state funds to hide any economic problems and also to pad her own re-election campaigns in 2010 and 2014.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.882]  Because, as we pointed out, she was very hotly contested.
[00:11:39.902 --> 00:11:42.723]  60,000 fans booed her in the stadium.
[00:11:43.123 --> 00:11:50.286]  And then after those smartmatic voting machines, those electronic voting machines came in, all of a sudden...
[00:11:50.746 --> 00:11:52.947]  Everyone likes her, and she was re-elected.
[00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:58.548]  So, hmm, I wonder if any of that money was used to pad for those electronic voter machines.
[00:11:58.948 --> 00:11:59.389]  But you know what?
[00:11:59.409 --> 00:12:04.370]  That's probably sexist of me to say that because, indeed, she is a woman.
[00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.071]  And that's what Hillary Clinton says that...
[00:12:08.552 --> 00:12:13.896]  Anything that's against her, her high unfavorable rating, it's because of sexism.
[00:12:14.316 --> 00:12:16.798]  This is according to CNN's Errol Lewis.
[00:12:16.858 --> 00:12:28.267]  He was asked by the host there on a panel, Chris Cuomo, why Hillary's unfavorable rating is 20 points down from where it should be with registered Democrats, and Lewis said that
[00:12:28.967 --> 00:12:33.151]  The Clinton strategists think that misogyny amongst voters is a primary reason.
[00:12:33.171 --> 00:12:38.756]  A lot of the sexism, I mean, it's buried so deep that people just say, I don't trust her.
[00:12:38.916 --> 00:12:39.917]  She doesn't keep her word.
[00:12:40.297 --> 00:12:42.899]  And even the host, Chris Cuomo, couldn't sit there.
[00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:45.661]  He kind of sat and listened and said, huh, really, sexism?
[00:12:46.702 --> 00:12:47.483]  And then he stopped him.
[00:12:47.523 --> 00:12:50.606]  He was like, are you sure it's not the cascade of scandals?
[00:12:51.266 --> 00:12:53.468]  That makes people not trust Hillary Clinton.
[00:12:53.928 --> 00:12:54.989]  Totally delusional.
[00:12:55.329 --> 00:13:04.015]  Just like our boy Ted Cruz, who of course is claiming that he has won landslides over and over again by beating Donald Trump.
[00:13:04.035 --> 00:13:05.576]  They've been kind of going at it on Twitter.
[00:13:05.616 --> 00:13:09.839]  He says he's landslides in five consecutive states.
[00:13:10.419 --> 00:13:14.180]  Even though only one of those states even held an election.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.701]  Because as we know, he doesn't care about the votes.
[00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:18.541]  We don't need no stinking votes.
[00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:19.861]  He's got the delegates.
[00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:28.723]  And now it's also been revealed that the Colorado lawmakers who voted to scrap the election are actually Ted Cruz delegates.
[00:13:29.124 --> 00:13:36.365]  So more and more, we're kind of seeing behind the scenes there of just how this is kind of a long-term game.
[00:13:36.705 --> 00:13:38.866]  Wayne Madsen details even more.
[00:13:40.268 --> 00:13:42.490]  Wayne, you've heard me throw out a lot of points here.
[00:13:42.931 --> 00:13:44.012]  The election theft.
[00:13:44.492 --> 00:13:45.973]  Why are they so scared of Trump?
[00:13:46.594 --> 00:13:48.196]  What's other big news you're working on?
[00:13:48.236 --> 00:13:53.460]  I know you've broken some big stories as well that are at WayneMadsenReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:13:53.781 --> 00:13:56.523]  Karl Rove backing Cruz and Clinton at the same time.
[00:13:57.724 --> 00:14:01.668]  Also, you asked, was Cruz's father linked to the JFK assassination?
[00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:17.724]  Cuban hired by Lee Harvey Oswald, bears a striking resemblance, but we know he was tied into these very groups, so we can, and the Bushes were running that operation, we know he later, Cruz himself came to work for the Bushes, so let's cover those issues right now, Wayne.
[00:14:18.427 --> 00:14:22.710]  Well yeah, the one I'm currently working on is the Raphael Cruz.
[00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:27.875]  Now, there's actually, there's like three Raphael Cruz's.
[00:14:28.615 --> 00:14:35.701]  This gets really complicated, but when I'm looking at the background of the Cruz family, I think we've got another Obama.
[00:14:36.422 --> 00:14:39.444]  We've got CIA people on both sides, mom and dad.
[00:14:42.426 --> 00:15:05.197]  The photograph, the one with Lee Harvey Oswald pamphleteering in front of the International Trademark in New Orleans, by the way, which was owned by Clay Shaw, who was the main target of Jim Garrison's investigation, we have the only guy not identified in that photograph is the guy that looks a lot like Rafael Cruz.
[00:15:05.937 --> 00:15:07.658]  I've got the FBI report
[00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:13.124]  From November 1963, they were not able to identify that individual.
[00:15:13.944 --> 00:15:27.739]  The House Select Committee on Assassinations of 1978, Robert Blakey, the General Counsel, recently reaffirmed after he appeared on Frontline, he said, we don't know who that guy is.
[00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:29.381]  We never determined who that guy is.
[00:15:30.578 --> 00:15:41.804]  Well, even if you're not going to use the photo as evidence of Raphael's ties to the people in New Orleans that were being looked at by Jim Garrison, let's look at his company he worked for.
[00:15:41.824 --> 00:15:52.649]  He said he was a geophysical computer guy for this company that was owned by a French oil services company, Schlumberger.
[00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:55.171]  The heir to the Schlumberger company.
[00:15:56.051 --> 00:16:06.135]  Jean de Menil winds up as a member of the board of directors of Permandex out of New Orleans, which was a CIA front company run by who?
[00:16:06.395 --> 00:16:07.195]  Clay Shaw.
[00:16:07.756 --> 00:16:11.617]  The photograph of the Raphael Cruz lookalike is taken where?
[00:16:11.977 --> 00:16:15.639]  In front of the international trademark owned by Clay Shaw.
[00:16:16.219 --> 00:16:21.061]  But the story on Raphael Cruz and the grandparents
[00:16:22.161 --> 00:16:26.804]  His name was, look, Ted Cruz's father was Rafael Bienvenidos Cruz.
[00:16:27.664 --> 00:16:30.145]  His father was Rafael Bienvenidos Cruz.
[00:16:30.265 --> 00:16:36.848]  Now, I'm trying to look up records on people with the same last name, but the grandparents came from Cuba in 1966.
[00:16:38.249 --> 00:16:39.190]  Rafael came in 57.
[00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:43.512]  He said he came to escape Castro's Cuba.
[00:16:43.612 --> 00:16:47.554]  In 57, Castro wasn't in power for another three years, so he lied about that.
[00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:59.564]  His father worked for RCA in Cuba at a time when RCA was involved in a lot of anti-communist activities, including setting up clandestine radio stations for the CIA.
[00:17:00.265 --> 00:17:03.908]  So, you know, what do we know about the Cruz family?
[00:17:04.389 --> 00:17:07.572]  Right now we know about as much as we know about Obama's family in 2008.
[00:17:09.253 --> 00:17:20.558]  And mea culpa, I didn't look at Obama's family back then, and I found out soon enough, weeks after his inauguration, how he was linked to the CIA.
[00:17:21.018 --> 00:17:23.159]  And it turns out the whole family was.
[00:17:23.179 --> 00:17:25.821]  Well, I'll tell you, Cruz's dad does have a
[00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:49.199]  Interesting looking features that are somewhat unique, and it does look like a spinning image of his dad, but then you add it in together with the whole Cuban community, how he's one of the early communities, how he's hooked into all these different skunk works type organizations, and then how his son goes right up at the top with the Bushes, who we know are running the operation to kill Kennedy, George Herbert Walker Bush Sr.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.926]  Who's come out and declassified documents to have been in the CIA in the early 60s.
[00:17:53.946 --> 00:17:56.330]  He lied about it when he became the director in the 70s.
[00:17:56.691 --> 00:17:58.574]  Just magically the director but never been in it.
[00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:08.295]  Yeah, and one of the guys in that photograph in front of the trademark at the far right is Chauncey Holt, who was the accountant for Meyer Lansky, the mobster.
[00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:20.382]  And Chauncey Holt apparently told author Ed Haslam, who wrote a book about all this in New Orleans in those years, that
[00:18:21.543 --> 00:18:25.548]  All the Cubans in that photograph were part of the CIA's Operation Mongoose.
[00:18:25.988 --> 00:18:29.893]  That was the clandestine program to overthrow Fidel Castro.
[00:18:29.933 --> 00:18:38.903]  And Oswald was there doing all this just to, you know, sheep-dip these people as part of a pro-Castro movement.
[00:18:39.023 --> 00:18:39.804]  Sure, it's a cover.
[00:18:40.484 --> 00:18:40.965]  Absolutely.
[00:18:41.105 --> 00:18:42.447]  This is to get that legend going.
[00:19:02.073 --> 00:19:05.797]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very, very carefully.
[00:19:06.518 --> 00:19:14.487]  Because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many, many people around me.
[00:19:15.008 --> 00:19:21.376]  I was a big sports enthusiast, but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old, up to about 22 or so.
[00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:28.102]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:34.408]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work, I stopped working out.
[00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:39.193]  And everything was okay for four or five years, but then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:43.096]  And in the next 10 years, I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:56.459]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances, and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight, and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.040]  I even changed my diet.
[00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.742]  I even increased the exercise.
[00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:00.303]  It didn't work.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:06.190]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed
[00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.177]  My whole life changed.
[00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:14.844]  I've gone from 200 and almost 80 pounds down to about 220 pounds or so.
[00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:16.446]  It is incredible.
[00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:24.635]  And in just the last three years, Super Male Vitality, developed by Dr. Grube for mfulworthslife.com exclusively,

[00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:40.090]  I work out less, even though I'm older, I've lost more weight, my muscles got stronger, my stamina, my libido, and so much more.

[00:23:03.536 --> 00:23:12.182]  A Gulf War veteran who moved to Colorado last year has had his children confiscated by the state of Kansas over his use of marijuana.
[00:23:12.742 --> 00:23:23.069]  Now this is 40-year-old Raymond Schwab and he relied on medical marijuana to treat PTSD after he suffered severe side effects from medicines that were prescribed to him by the VA.
[00:23:23.429 --> 00:23:30.474]  Now the Department of Veterans Affairs prescribes Schwab with an assortment of medicines like they tend to do including
[00:23:30.874 --> 00:23:33.977]  Anti-anxiety drugs, muscle relaxants and pain medicines.
[00:23:34.597 --> 00:23:36.779]  But he said they did not work well for him.
[00:23:36.859 --> 00:23:38.961]  In fact, they made his condition a lot worse.
[00:23:39.462 --> 00:23:43.205]  And so he found that it was medical marijuana that was the only thing that helped.
[00:23:43.505 --> 00:23:49.070]  And in fact, now that is the only thing that he relies on to treat his pain as well as his PTSD.
[00:23:49.471 --> 00:23:57.397]  Well, nine months ago, he and his wife planned to move to Colorado in order to start growing medicinal marijuana to help other veterans.
[00:23:58.178 --> 00:24:09.587]  And right as they were preparing for this move, the state of Kansas took five of their children, ages five to 16, into custody on suspicion of child endangerment.
[00:24:09.968 --> 00:24:24.920]  So it's been nine months now, a judge declared that the claims of child endangerment were unsubstantiated, but the children have not been returned to the Schwab's, and they're now asking how the state is able to keep their kids
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.481]  And keep them in custody even after the charges against them have been dismissed.
[00:24:30.041 --> 00:24:35.382]  So joining me now are Raymond and Amelia Schwab from the steps of the Capitol building there in Kansas.
[00:24:35.782 --> 00:24:39.383]  Now talk to me a little bit about this federal lawsuit that's just recently been filed.
[00:24:39.443 --> 00:24:43.824]  I know that was actually what compelled you to end a 17-day hunger strike.
[00:24:44.245 --> 00:24:45.925]  So where do we stand now with this case?
[00:24:46.983 --> 00:24:47.203]  Right.
[00:24:47.263 --> 00:24:54.166]  Well, the reason I ended, as you said, is because one of my conditions to end was a higher authority to step in.
[00:24:54.186 --> 00:25:01.329]  So an attorney out of California named Matthew Pappas flew out here and helped me initially file it pro se.
[00:25:02.129 --> 00:25:07.231]  We've added close to 27 or more defendants to the complaint.
[00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:11.893]  We just recently found out that the federal court is allowing us to file
[00:25:12.533 --> 00:25:17.398]  And the amazing thing is, because it's pro se, all of these individuals are going to be served by U.S.
[00:25:17.498 --> 00:25:18.018]  Marshals.
[00:25:18.398 --> 00:25:23.503]  I would love to be able to see their faces when they get those documents, but yeah, we're just pushing forward.
[00:25:24.364 --> 00:25:38.576]  Matthew is trying to get aligned with the attorney we have that's local, because that way he can come into the lawsuit, but eventually he's going to fully take it over, and we're definitely seeking full accountability under the law for what they've done to my family.
[00:25:39.181 --> 00:25:41.842]  Right, and you're definitely not the exception here.
[00:25:41.862 --> 00:25:46.665]  You have been, a lot of families have actually been coming out of the woodwork.
[00:25:46.705 --> 00:25:59.151]  People who are afraid to speak out because of the bullying, because they have other children at home, that they're afraid if they do speak out that perhaps Child Family Services is going to come in and take the other kids out of the home.
[00:25:59.171 --> 00:26:05.574]  So they're just quiet and allow themselves to be bullied by this system that is destroying families.
[00:26:06.094 --> 00:26:07.175]  Now I know that you guys are
[00:26:08.115 --> 00:26:18.017]  One of the things that is making this such a big impact here with this case is that you were kind of dealing with the cross-state line.
[00:26:18.057 --> 00:26:29.700]  So in Colorado, where you are living, where you were about to move to, marijuana is legalized there, even for recreational use, but you all were using it there medically.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.061]  And then, of course, in Kansas, they said, well, we don't agree with that here.
[00:26:34.441 --> 00:26:49.565]  And so, just in the instance of this state, just to note how the tensions are really high between these neighboring states of Colorado, sheriffs from Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Kansas all filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado for these marijuana laws.
[00:26:49.605 --> 00:26:56.147]  They cite trafficking concerns, so it's almost as if they're using you as an example to
[00:26:57.248 --> 00:27:08.562]  To let Colorado and other states that would pass this legislation know that, well, we have the power here and we're going to hold our thumb down on these families that would dare not follow their rules.
[00:27:09.599 --> 00:27:11.741]  Yeah, and I said the same thing from the beginning.
[00:27:11.761 --> 00:27:28.156]  When I got a copy of the police report, they had a snapshot from my Facebook where I said that we were moving back home to get involved in a dispensary and start working with veterans, help get them off medication through the use of cannabis oil because we have record numbers of veterans overdosing.
[00:27:28.716 --> 00:27:55.087]  Prescription drugs and so they actually snapshotted that and put it in the file as part of the reason why they were taking our kids and You know as we travel back and forth We've had car rental agencies say that we have to be careful because they're actually targeting any kind of fleet Colorado license plates when they cross the border even since we've been here on the Capitol, you know, I've been to a congressional or a committee hearing here Against a really bad bill.
[00:27:55.127 --> 00:27:57.108]  They were trying to pass a hemp oil bill.
[00:27:57.148 --> 00:27:57.808]  They called it a
[00:27:58.368 --> 00:28:05.815]  And the facts and statistics they give concerning cannabis, it's like watching an episode of Reefer Madness.
[00:28:06.176 --> 00:28:07.677]  Some of the things they're saying, it's crazy.
[00:28:07.797 --> 00:28:09.259]  I mean, it's total propaganda.
[00:28:09.399 --> 00:28:09.599]  Right.
[00:28:09.639 --> 00:28:19.328]  Well, they're absolutely ignorant to its beneficial uses, and especially with veterans, because they're not actually doing any long-term studies on the benefits of medicinal marijuana.
[00:28:20.109 --> 00:28:26.273]  They'll put the veterans on 30 different type of psychotropic drugs that are probably going to have a lot of adverse reactions with each other.
[00:28:26.733 --> 00:28:27.834]  And that's completely fine.
[00:28:28.094 --> 00:28:32.817]  These prescription drugs that actually kill more people than heroin or cocaine or something.
[00:28:32.857 --> 00:28:40.442]  If you were just to buy the drug right off the street, you'd have a better chance of surviving than you would if you got put on these legal prescriptions.
[00:28:40.482 --> 00:28:42.344]  So that's why I find it so infuriating.
[00:28:42.824 --> 00:28:45.726]  But something else that's going on here with this case which
[00:28:46.546 --> 00:28:48.927]  Many, many families are actually dealing with.
[00:28:49.688 --> 00:28:51.229]  Is this kids for cash?
[00:28:51.589 --> 00:29:08.378]  Now you mentioned earlier when we spoke on the phone that Kansas was actually one of the first states, or this might have been Nikko, but was one of the first states that actually privatized this idea of getting money from taking kids from their families and then fostering them out.
[00:29:08.898 --> 00:29:11.420]  So talk to me a little bit about what's happening in your case.
[00:29:12.469 --> 00:29:24.714]  Well, what's ironic is I believe that privatization was the result of an ACLU lawsuit because Kansas was doing a poor job and kids were dying and being abused, so that was like a penalty.
[00:29:25.095 --> 00:29:28.176]  But then these businesses came in, like we have one here, it's called St.
[00:29:28.216 --> 00:29:28.756]  Francis.
[00:29:29.096 --> 00:29:32.618]  They have a hospital where they report parents and kidnap children.
[00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:40.863]  They have an adoption agency and they also have volunteer caseworkers that are called children's advocates that actually work with the children.
[00:29:41.203 --> 00:29:46.026]  So they're involved from A to Z of this child kidnapping and then selling them out.
[00:29:46.086 --> 00:29:59.755]  If you go to their websites and DCF websites for Kansas, it's almost like looking at a puppy shopping bazaar online because they have these kids with these little bios and they're smiling and how great they would be to be adopted out.
[00:29:59.835 --> 00:30:02.297]  It's really, really sad and disgusting.
[00:30:02.677 --> 00:30:08.119]  Because as we've had people come up here and just share their cases, it's just happening over and over and over.
[00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:23.564]  And I believe last year, and I'm not sure if this is a completely accurate statistic, but Kansas made something like $17.5 million, that's just the state, in federal bonuses for planting kids outside of their kinship structure.
[00:30:23.844 --> 00:30:28.546]  But that doesn't include the private social workers or the case managers.
[00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:29.166]  I think so.
[00:30:44.961 --> 00:30:51.745]  Absolute signs of abuse and this child actually, a four-year-old, ended up dying because neglected.
[00:30:52.125 --> 00:31:00.490]  And so you're seeing in a lot of these instances that they're taking children that are quote-unquote more adoptable or more, you know, easier to foster.
[00:31:00.931 --> 00:31:07.174]  Whereas the other, maybe trouble kids, the trouble cases, they just kind of look away, ignore them, and then they end up being killed.
[00:31:07.494 --> 00:31:08.515]  This happens all the time.
[00:31:08.895 --> 00:31:13.218]  Just to put up on the screen for people to see how much they're making.
[00:31:13.838 --> 00:31:15.059]  They're getting bonuses.
[00:31:15.079 --> 00:31:43.358]  They get a referral rate almost $4,000 there and referrals just you know something like that if they $5,000 if they place them somewhere $7,500 for children 9 to 13 $10,000 per placement for children 14 and older so this is a huge racket I mean they are making money and especially when you consider kids that get lost in the system so they're not adopted out they're just locked up in the system constantly
[00:31:43.938 --> 00:31:48.280]  People make their entire year's revenue off of fostering children.
[00:31:49.001 --> 00:31:51.082]  They do, and I think my wife would know more about this.
[00:31:51.442 --> 00:31:53.663]  How much is it for a Native American child that you heard?
[00:31:55.494 --> 00:32:07.284]  I think it was something like $25,000 if it's a Native American child, because they're under a different federal structure, but if the tribe doesn't step in, they actually get more money for destroying Indian families.
[00:32:07.624 --> 00:32:16.872]  Now, I haven't 100% verified that, but it's consistent with the pattern that we've seen, that they have high-value targets that they go after.
[00:32:17.592 --> 00:32:23.096]  And if they don't have damaged kids that are on medication, then they make them damaged and put them on medication.
[00:32:23.376 --> 00:32:25.818]  My son is currently in a psychiatric institute.
[00:32:26.318 --> 00:32:27.659]  He is not mentally ill.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:34.284]  They did it because my wife refused to authorize them putting him on basically legal methamphetamine.
[00:32:34.564 --> 00:32:34.925]  Right.
[00:32:35.365 --> 00:32:45.487]  Well, Raymond, hold that thought because I actually want to, after the break, I want to finish up with you so we can talk a little bit about what's actually happening to your children now that they're in protective custody.
[00:32:45.947 --> 00:32:50.228]  And I also want you to let parents out there know what they can do if they're dealing with this as well.
[00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:51.828]  So stick around, we'll be right back.
[00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.751]  A lot of people ask me, what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:04.261 --> 00:37:10.263]  They even had the children believe that I was in a hospital because I was sick when they were first taken.
[00:37:10.683 --> 00:37:12.463]  My daughter was like, are you okay mom?
[00:37:12.503 --> 00:37:13.043]  Are you well?
[00:37:13.123 --> 00:37:15.544]  And my wife was like, yeah, I'm fine.
[00:37:15.844 --> 00:37:17.824]  We heard her say to someone, okay, my mom's better.
[00:37:17.864 --> 00:37:18.685]  I'm going home now.
[00:37:18.705 --> 00:37:23.406]  And they said that it was just a good way to explain to a young child.
[00:37:24.614 --> 00:37:28.057]  Yeah, that she's sick and that's why she's not coming for you.
[00:37:28.518 --> 00:37:33.122]  So what sort of thing has been happening with your children that you're aware of?
[00:37:33.162 --> 00:37:38.987]  Because I understand you've only been able to see them twice in the last, more than a year now?
[00:37:39.007 --> 00:37:42.009]  No, it's been more than that, about six times.
[00:37:43.203 --> 00:37:43.903]  But not a lot.
[00:37:45.304 --> 00:37:51.048]  You know, we have to travel 600 miles to do it, and it costs a lot of money to travel and stay here.
[00:37:51.888 --> 00:37:57.992]  Plus, they were just doing all these intrusions into our privacy to try to force us into complying with them or not see our kids.
[00:37:58.092 --> 00:38:03.555]  And then the kids would show up late, and they wouldn't rearrange it so that we could still have our time.
[00:38:03.595 --> 00:38:04.516]  They just cut it short.
[00:38:05.056 --> 00:38:05.737]  Yeah, one visit.
[00:38:05.937 --> 00:38:07.238]  They were 45 minutes late.
[00:38:07.278 --> 00:38:10.239]  We got 15 minutes with our daughter, which broke her heart.
[00:38:10.259 --> 00:38:11.880]  She was like, where are you going, Mom and Dad?
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:12.721]  I just got here.
[00:38:13.425 --> 00:38:16.307]  And they're like, well, we'll make it up next time.
[00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:18.709]  We're like, we just drove 600 miles.
[00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:20.991]  You know, you're not helping us pay for this.
[00:38:21.071 --> 00:38:24.173]  So, but we are having a visit on Tuesday.
[00:38:25.034 --> 00:38:27.196]  My son gets to come for the first time in a year.
[00:38:27.756 --> 00:38:33.441]  They've been retaliating against him for testifying on our behalf that the allegations were false.
[00:38:33.781 --> 00:38:36.083]  Couldn't even get a supervised phone call with them.
[00:38:36.783 --> 00:38:43.028]  And now he finally gets a visit, but that's why he's joined our federal lawsuit because of what they've put him through.
[00:38:43.982 --> 00:39:08.453]  And so just tell me a little bit briefly what sort of hoops they wanted you all to jump through so families can understand because a lot of times what happens is you know if you've got nothing to hide you're just going to open your door to child protective services not understanding that they are building a case against you from the very minute that they step across that threshold and so then in order to
[00:39:09.133 --> 00:39:10.695]  They really set you up for failure, I think.
[00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:11.916]  I had 23 things just on my case plan alone.
[00:39:31.567 --> 00:39:32.909]  They knew that I didn't have a vehicle.
[00:39:32.949 --> 00:39:38.577]  My husband was working in Denver and I didn't have a vehicle or we didn't get service up at where we lived.
[00:39:38.678 --> 00:39:42.143]  So it was really impossible for me to do the things that they were asking to do for one.
[00:39:42.904 --> 00:39:46.469]  But when you're so overwhelmed with grief because you just lost your children...
[00:39:47.828 --> 00:39:51.069]  That's really overwhelming to see that you have to do so many things.
[00:39:51.649 --> 00:39:54.330]  But even when you do them, they don't care.
[00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:55.770]  They're not going to give them back anyway.
[00:39:56.011 --> 00:40:02.593]  And they'll twist them because you have to do like this to do mental health evaluations, drug and alcohol evaluations, parenting class.
[00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:08.034]  Because I'm a man, I have to do a domestic violence abuser intervention course, which I protest.
[00:40:08.074 --> 00:40:09.475]  I don't even have domestic violence.
[00:40:10.915 --> 00:40:21.717]  It was just nutty, all the things they were just putting on us, but see, people, all those classes get paid, the mental health people get paid, but then they're doing worse things, because we've met people this has happened to.
[00:40:22.037 --> 00:40:32.960]  You'll do the mental health evaluation, they'll say, well, we think you're bipolar, so you're going to have to take this medication, and if you refuse, they'll say you're not complying with your plan, and they will try to terminate your rights.
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:39.681]  So they're actually forced medicating parents and children, which we all know about psychotropics, how terrible they are.
[00:40:40.061 --> 00:40:44.166]  So it's really just a war against the family by a government agency.
[00:40:44.707 --> 00:40:52.817]  Well absolutely and talk to me a little bit about what is going on with your children now because I know that was one of the big issues that they are wanting to force Medicaid.
[00:40:56.912 --> 00:41:02.094]  Yeah, one of our children, we found out, because we told them in the beginning, you better not put him on psychotropic drugs.
[00:41:02.134 --> 00:41:04.074]  We haven't lost our parental rights.
[00:41:04.154 --> 00:41:07.095]  And they did anyway, by the way, for a time until we caught it.
[00:41:07.355 --> 00:41:08.255]  Yeah, and then we caught it.
[00:41:08.375 --> 00:41:17.858]  When I became my own attorney and asked for discovery, they knew I was going to see all the records, and they said, oh, you didn't know we've had him on this legal methamphetamine for weeks, and we're taking him off right now.
[00:41:18.298 --> 00:41:20.679]  But then they called a conference where my wife
[00:41:20.879 --> 00:41:24.841]  I was talking to the psychologist at the school and they're like, well, we really need to put him on this.
[00:41:24.881 --> 00:41:25.961]  And she said, absolutely not.
[00:41:26.281 --> 00:41:27.662]  I've homeschooled him his whole life.
[00:41:27.822 --> 00:41:32.424]  I know how, what natural remedies you guys can use if you're just going to take the time to do it right.
[00:41:32.944 --> 00:41:43.449]  And so they created this dynamic against him where they said he was having troubled behavior, which even if he was, I mean, he just got kidnapped from his parents.
[00:41:43.529 --> 00:41:44.169]  Yeah.
[00:41:44.209 --> 00:41:44.709]  What's he going to be?
[00:41:44.729 --> 00:41:45.590]  A sweet little angel?
[00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:52.593]  Right, and so because of that, he has been locked in a psychiatric institute for two weeks now.
[00:41:52.993 --> 00:41:58.236]  We found out, got an email saying he got assaulted and punched in the face, this sweet little homeschool boy.
[00:41:58.836 --> 00:42:01.117]  And they said, but it's okay, he got new glasses.
[00:42:01.497 --> 00:42:03.218]  That's how detached from reality.
[00:42:03.498 --> 00:42:06.580]  It's okay, your son got assaulted, but we got him new glasses.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:12.283]  And I just don't understand how these people get up every day and live with what they're doing to these children.
[00:42:12.836 --> 00:42:15.318]  No, it's really completely frightening.
[00:42:15.759 --> 00:42:17.600]  Now, I want to put up your GoFundMe page.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:22.024]  I know you guys have been trying to raise funds to just help with this entire situation.
[00:42:22.084 --> 00:42:33.093]  As you mentioned, you guys have been having to go back and forth 600 miles to try to jump through the hoops that they give you to complete all the different courses and things like that.
[00:42:33.554 --> 00:42:37.317]  But I also wanted to draw attention to another website that you have
[00:42:37.637 --> 00:42:37.938]  I think so.
[00:42:47.662 --> 00:42:56.728]  Sure, we just started a blog, it's called Free Our Children, the Parent Underground for Combating DCF Child Trafficking, where we're trying to connect groups.
[00:42:56.789 --> 00:43:08.497]  We found there are a lot of groups, but they're very disconnected, and we wanted to connect them where parents, because our phones are blown up all day long, emails all day long, where we could have just a source for them to go to.
[00:43:09.037 --> 00:43:31.701]  Where they can get some legal tips, talk about pro se, representation of yourself, what to watch for, what to do when DCF INTS comes to your door, where when they're calling or phoning, we can say, go to this website first, see if there's activists in your state, and just connect parents to real advocates, because a lot of these advocacy groups out there actually receive state funding, and they're like Trojan horses.
[00:43:32.041 --> 00:43:35.562]  They say, oh, we're here to help you, and then they report on you and help get your kids kidnapped.
[00:43:35.862 --> 00:43:38.302]  We want an actual advocacy hub
[00:43:38.732 --> 00:43:48.701]  Where people from all over the country can connect and even around the world and share their stories and connect and get resources that we can put an end to this kids for cash cartel.
[00:43:49.141 --> 00:43:49.441]  Right.
[00:43:49.481 --> 00:43:52.103]  People need to understand that this is absolutely going on.
[00:43:52.464 --> 00:44:03.773]  When we've reported on the prisons for profit, people didn't believe that was happening, didn't believe that it was the prosecutors and the attorneys and the judges who actually own these prisons who are now deciding that
[00:44:04.394 --> 00:44:04.654]  Yeah.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.081]  Neglected while they're in these foster homes.
[00:44:26.482 --> 00:44:29.403]  A lot of cases where children are being assaulted.
[00:44:29.484 --> 00:44:45.113]  Terrible things happening and there's no accountability there and you as people who are just trying to do the right thing and trying to comply, trying to jump through the hoops, are being treated like the criminal element here and having yourselves be destroyed in the media.
[00:44:45.673 --> 00:44:49.756]  Just a lot of the articles that they try to put out about you to try to, you know, paint you as this
[00:44:50.376 --> 00:44:58.393]  Unfit parenting when obviously, you know, you guys have been out there on the Capitol steps I mean doesn't seem like people who have abandoned their kids
[00:44:59.844 --> 00:45:01.905]  Yeah, we've been here almost 34 days now, actually.
[00:45:01.925 --> 00:45:13.653]  The hunger strike was for 17, but once we've seen all these families coming up here and saying, you have given us hope, you've given us strength, we didn't know you could fight these people, we're terrified of them, we thought, we're going to stay.
[00:45:14.033 --> 00:45:15.814]  We're not going home just because we have a lawsuit.
[00:45:15.834 --> 00:45:22.939]  We're going to stay up here and continue to give people hope that you can fight, and we're going to fight the state from the steps of the state capitol.
[00:45:22.959 --> 00:45:24.500]  You can't get any more classic than that.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.020]  It's a beautiful thing.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.122]  Until we get our kids back or end up in jail.
[00:45:28.542 --> 00:45:29.523]  Yeah, for some.
[00:45:29.743 --> 00:45:41.950]  I mean, we want to see some conclusion to this before we voluntarily depart from this because it's really drawn a lot of families out of hiding, saying, we want your help.
[00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:43.791]  And can you tell us how you did this?
[00:45:43.811 --> 00:45:50.495]  And they're watching our videos and newscasts like this and, you know, figuring out that, hey, we can stand up against these bullies.
[00:45:51.095 --> 00:45:54.157]  We just have to know our rights and have the courage to do it.
[00:45:54.508 --> 00:45:55.508]  Right, absolutely.
[00:45:55.848 --> 00:45:58.889]  Well, Raymond and Amelia, thank you guys so much for sharing your story.
[00:45:59.589 --> 00:46:01.770]  Everybody out there, go to the GoFundMe page.
[00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:03.030]  Help this family out.
[00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:07.531]  They are standing up for your rights as well as the rights of their own family.
[00:46:08.092 --> 00:46:10.772]  And, you know, it really is time to take our kids back.
[00:46:10.872 --> 00:46:15.474]  And this is a war on the family because they're going to be coming after all you single mothers out there.
[00:46:15.554 --> 00:46:20.915]  Any of you families that are going through a divorce and, you know, perhaps you're having a little bit of issues with
[00:46:21.295 --> 00:46:23.017]  You know, with your own relationship.
[00:46:23.097 --> 00:46:26.580]  Well, that could be a case for them to come take your kids.
[00:46:26.921 --> 00:46:29.163]  You know, there's people out there who have disabilities.
[00:46:29.523 --> 00:46:32.026]  They could be snatching your kids from you, saying that you're unfit.
[00:46:32.106 --> 00:46:36.010]  Meanwhile, they are raking in the dough for breaking up homes.
[00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:39.714]  So you all, thank you so much for joining us, and we'll be speaking with you soon.

[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.782]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.902 --> 00:47:16.705]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.925 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.990]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:53.014]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.

[00:49:05.207 --> 00:49:09.210]  We have anti-Iraq war protesters here in Portland.
[00:49:09.591 --> 00:49:13.474]  I stood with them and it was the damn neo-Nazis that screwed up the protest.
[00:49:13.654 --> 00:49:15.015]  They went broke buildings.
[00:49:15.055 --> 00:49:19.398]  This is the anti-war rally that we were talking about.
[00:49:19.418 --> 00:49:20.079]  We're not them.
[00:49:20.099 --> 00:49:20.699]  We're not them.
[00:49:20.839 --> 00:49:21.560]  We're not them.
[00:49:23.021 --> 00:49:23.221]  Okay.
[00:49:23.281 --> 00:49:24.521]  We're not there with that.
[00:49:24.561 --> 00:49:25.401]  You just hang around.
[00:49:25.481 --> 00:49:26.002]  I get it.
[00:49:26.042 --> 00:49:26.942]  Yeah, you just, yeah.
[00:49:26.962 --> 00:49:28.602]  Alright, so we got through.
[00:49:28.722 --> 00:49:32.743]  Your candidate is literally just the guy that Stormfront endorses.
[00:49:32.763 --> 00:49:33.323]  That's whatever.
[00:49:33.343 --> 00:49:36.843]  Hey, Donald Trump's not perfect, but... See, we established middle ground.
[00:49:36.943 --> 00:49:38.804]  We just established middle ground.
[00:49:38.824 --> 00:49:41.524]  David Duke endorses all sorts of damn people.
[00:49:41.544 --> 00:49:43.925]  Yeah, he can endorse everyone else.
[00:49:43.985 --> 00:49:45.725]  He comes out every four years.
[00:49:45.785 --> 00:49:47.425]  He comes out every four years.
[00:49:47.465 --> 00:49:49.586]  Yeah, endorse the most racist candidates.
[00:49:49.606 --> 00:49:50.826]  That doesn't mean they're racist.
[00:49:50.886 --> 00:49:52.446]  He comes out every one of you.
[00:49:52.746 --> 00:49:54.707]  Hey, what's racist about a wall?
[00:49:54.787 --> 00:49:57.169]  Hey, what's racist about a wall?
[00:49:57.249 --> 00:49:58.830]  Hey, how is he racist?
[00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:00.691]  You sound like an idiot.
[00:50:00.911 --> 00:50:02.492]  How is he racist?
[00:50:02.552 --> 00:50:03.393]  How is he racist?
[00:50:03.473 --> 00:50:05.314]  Yeah, how is he racist?
[00:50:05.414 --> 00:50:07.575]  One racist thing Donald Trump has said.
[00:50:07.675 --> 00:50:09.056]  Has he said one racist thing?
[00:50:09.076 --> 00:50:09.836]  Yes, seriously.
[00:50:09.877 --> 00:50:10.957]  Quote something racist.
[00:50:10.997 --> 00:50:12.498]  Quote something racist.
[00:50:12.538 --> 00:50:14.339]  We want a statement that makes sense.
[00:50:14.399 --> 00:50:19.082]  So obviously you haven't done your research and you're just going along with what everyone else is saying.
[00:50:19.102 --> 00:50:20.543]  So go do some research.
[00:50:20.563 --> 00:50:22.024]  Come back with some quotes, okay?
[00:50:22.704 --> 00:50:23.465]  Hey!
[00:50:23.585 --> 00:50:23.965]  Hey!
[00:50:24.145 --> 00:50:24.425]  Hey!
[00:50:25.626 --> 00:50:26.107]  Hey!
[00:50:27.107 --> 00:50:27.848]  Hey!
[00:50:27.988 --> 00:50:28.668]  Hey!
[00:50:28.748 --> 00:50:29.029]  Hey!
[00:50:29.169 --> 00:50:29.309]  Hey!
[00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.909]  Hey!
[00:50:29.949 --> 00:50:30.109]  Hey!
[00:50:30.169 --> 00:50:30.489]  Hey!
[00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:30.890]  Hey!
[00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:31.010]  Hey!
[00:50:52.504 --> 00:50:54.865]  Alright, what happened?
[00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:57.006]  What'd I miss?
[00:50:57.046 --> 00:50:57.766]  Wow!
[00:50:57.886 --> 00:50:58.707]  Oh my God.
[00:50:59.347 --> 00:51:00.828]  This is the show!
[00:51:00.868 --> 00:51:02.188]  This is the show!
[00:51:24.073 --> 00:51:24.273]  Yeah.
[00:51:24.313 --> 00:51:25.034]  Yeah.
[00:51:44.516 --> 00:51:54.383]  We're getting the cops right now.
[00:52:12.995 --> 00:52:13.415]  Really quick, buddy.
[00:52:43.891 --> 00:52:45.732]  Richard Reeves with Infowars.com.
[00:52:45.832 --> 00:52:47.593]  It is Monday, April 18th.
[00:52:48.493 --> 00:53:02.541]  We are on the eve of the big New York primary, which occurs tomorrow, April 19th, Tuesday, 2016, where it is expected that Donald Trump will have a pretty good-sized victory in New York, and I think that that's exactly what's going to happen.
[00:53:03.681 --> 00:53:06.263]  We'll see about that delegate count that comes out of New York.
[00:53:06.943 --> 00:53:08.605]  Meanwhile, I am in Cleveland.
[00:53:08.665 --> 00:53:13.911]  I'm actually en route to Buffalo where there's going to be a big Donald Trump event tonight in Buffalo at 7 p.m.
[00:53:14.371 --> 00:53:14.752]  Eastern.
[00:53:15.152 --> 00:53:19.357]  But I am at the Quicken Loans Arena right across the street from me here in Cleveland, Ohio.
[00:53:19.777 --> 00:53:22.941]  This is where the big battle is going to be in July.
[00:53:22.981 --> 00:53:25.623]  This is where the RNC is going to be located.
[00:53:26.184 --> 00:53:46.120]  The big convention with all the delegates inside and one of the things that we got to watch out for amongst so many to watch out for are that in Texas during some of the senatorial district conventions we saw leftists actually trying to infiltrate that process and work their way up the ladder to end up inside this Quicken Arena.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.381]  It's already a given.
[00:53:47.441 --> 00:53:47.922]  It's already
[00:53:48.562 --> 00:53:48.942]  I don't
[00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:07.813]  Speaking of the nomination process and the delegate process.
[00:54:27.156 --> 00:54:35.640]  It looks to me like Donald Trump will have a difficult time probably getting that magic number of 1237, but I think there are so many scenarios that could happen.
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:52.028]  One of those scenarios that may happen is that there's going to be credentials challenges to states like Colorado, potentially Texas, any number of states' delegations might be challenged for their credentials if they didn't follow procedure to the letter, if they
[00:54:52.648 --> 00:55:00.651]  Broke the rules a little too much or bent the rules a little too much, then that could put their delegations at risk of not being seated in the arena.
[00:55:01.011 --> 00:55:03.311]  So, in theory, that number of 1,237, it could drop down to 1,050, 1,100, 1,150.
[00:55:03.732 --> 00:55:05.812]  It's got to be a majority number still, but if you take off
[00:55:11.494 --> 00:55:23.056]  Say a couple hundred delegates off the total of 2,000 plus delegates drop that down, well that'll drop down the 50% plus one delegates that are going to be needed to be victorious.
[00:55:23.396 --> 00:55:27.217]  Now another thing that can happen is he can have the 1237 right off the bat.
[00:55:27.257 --> 00:55:39.759]  Remember, now I don't know if you saw any of my reports in Iowa, but I talked about how the Donald Trump's real goal as far as the delegates were concerned, as far as pledged delegates, is to try to get 60% coming into Cleveland.
[00:55:40.399 --> 00:55:44.464]  He needed 60% to really be his own man, to not have to cut a deal.
[00:55:44.945 --> 00:55:47.087]  He needed to come into Cleveland with 60%.
[00:55:47.528 --> 00:55:50.731]  He wouldn't have to cut a deal with John Kasich necessarily.
[00:55:50.771 --> 00:55:52.473]  He wouldn't have to talk to Marco Rubio.
[00:55:52.514 --> 00:55:56.799]  He wouldn't have to talk to any of the other delegate holders.
[00:55:56.839 --> 00:55:59.882]  He wouldn't have to necessarily make a deal with Ted Cruz or whatever.
[00:56:00.583 --> 00:56:16.303]  But now, unfortunately for Donald Trump, he is in a circumstance and in a position where he may be looking at having to cut a deal that he doesn't necessarily want to do, but to get to the presidency he may have to do it.
[00:56:16.683 --> 00:56:18.225]  Now, another avenue would be
[00:56:19.671 --> 00:56:25.576]  It's my belief that, for example, in Colorado, you know, everybody's thinking that, well, Ted Cruz got all the delegates.
[00:56:25.916 --> 00:56:41.187]  Well, you know, he might get those all pledged to him on that first ballot, but Ted Cruz is subject to the same situation that Donald Trump is, where pledged delegates that are maybe pledged to Ted Cruz on the first ballot, second ballot, it varies from state to state.
[00:56:41.247 --> 00:56:47.392]  Some states have a rule where a delegate is pledged for one ballot and then free to vote their conscience on subsequent ballots.
[00:56:47.792 --> 00:56:48.813]  Other states, you've got to vote
[00:56:49.273 --> 00:56:51.855]  As a pledged delegate two or three or four times.
[00:56:51.895 --> 00:56:53.576]  So it varies from state to state.
[00:56:53.636 --> 00:57:04.603]  It's all, you know, a mishmash of rules because it is not totally centrally governed, which I kind of like the fact that it's not centrally governed, but we can talk about that in a different video.
[00:57:05.184 --> 00:57:16.712]  But bottom line is, is it's my belief that within that Ted Cruz delegation that's coming out of Colorado, I wouldn't be surprised if there's five or ten Trumpians
[00:57:17.392 --> 00:57:17.833]  That's right.
[00:57:33.871 --> 00:57:39.073]  That Ted Cruz is actually supposedly getting these delegates because they're free to vote their conscience.
[00:57:39.413 --> 00:57:57.378]  And that brings me to another point where over and over and over you're hearing by the mainstream news that if Trump doesn't get the 1237 or the 50% plus one, whatever that number ends up being, as I discussed earlier, if he doesn't get it on that first ballot, on that first go-round, that he's supposedly done.
[00:57:57.958 --> 00:58:00.200]  Well, I'm here to tell you, I don't think so.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:13.812]  I think that in one way, it would be even more poetic, just even a greater victory to see Donald Trump come in here and I hope he does win the first ballot, but let's just say he doesn't win the first ballot.
[00:58:14.412 --> 00:58:21.298]  Let's just say that the GOP establishment has jimmied everything around just enough in these primaries that he doesn't win the first ballot.
[00:58:21.618 --> 00:58:21.838]  Well,
[00:58:23.059 --> 00:58:30.204]  I really believe that on a subsequent ballot, maybe second, third, or fourth round of the ballots, that I think Donald Trump could win.
[00:58:30.624 --> 00:58:32.746]  It would be an even bigger victory.
[00:58:33.186 --> 00:58:35.908]  It would be even more notable.
[00:58:36.368 --> 00:58:37.689]  So watch for that.
[00:58:38.109 --> 00:58:40.191]  Watch for all these things to be in play.
[00:58:40.991 --> 00:58:42.933]  And watch for more GOP dirty tricks.
[00:58:42.993 --> 00:58:46.996]  I haven't even talked about the Electoral College in the general election, so that's for another video.
[00:58:47.416 --> 00:58:51.879]  In the meantime, thank you there in Austin, and we'll see you guys soon.
