[00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:22.397]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:26.438]  It is Tuesday, September 6th, 2016, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:27.618]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:35.120]  Tonight, no Hillary that wasn't a press conference.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:46.003]  After making claims that she often talks to the media, Hillary Clinton abruptly ended her questions and answers session when she couldn't stop coughing.
[00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:50.862]  Well, that doesn't sound too good.
[00:00:51.403 --> 00:00:59.752]  Meanwhile, the mainstream media and the Clinton campaign insist that Hillary's poor health condition is just a conspiracy theory.
[00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.757]  Then... Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[00:01:03.817 --> 00:01:04.518]  What does that mean?
[00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:14.305]  After claiming that the elections won't be rigged, Barack Obama now says the Russians may launch a covert operation to rig U.S.
[00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:15.026]  elections.
[00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:20.850]  And that means the DHS might be called in to monitor and assume direct control.
[00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:27.135]  All that plus more from Hacking Hillary, that's up next on the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:34.594]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:01:34.674 --> 00:01:45.622]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:50.705]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:53.327]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:01:53.407 --> 00:01:54.888]  It helps detoxify.
[00:01:55.088 --> 00:01:57.930]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.753]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:06.916]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:14.341]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:15.882]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:02:16.062 --> 00:02:16.802]  This is so key.
[00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:21.345]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:02:21.385 --> 00:02:23.487]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:02:23.607 --> 00:02:27.069]  Exclusively available at m4warslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:39.879]  Now we are introducing a new t-shirt, which I think folks need to get, telling the real truth about Bill Clinton, who is a serial rapist and a abuser of women.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.763]  In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will.
[00:02:43.943 --> 00:02:44.323]  And rape.
[00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:44.864]  And rape.
[00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:49.107]  Bill rapes them physically, and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[00:02:49.147 --> 00:02:49.808]  He's a rapist.
[00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:50.749]  Absolutely.
[00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.070]  He's a public figure, he'd go straight to hell.
[00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:00.212]  Get your Bill Clinton rape shirt today at infowarsstore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:03:02.352 --> 00:03:05.873]  No, Hillary Clinton, that was not a press conference.
[00:03:06.313 --> 00:03:19.636]  After refusing to give an actual press conference for some 276 days, Hillary Clinton's campaign put together a little Q&A session with a gaggle of establishment reporters aboard her new private jet.
[00:03:19.877 --> 00:03:21.197]  Of course, it abruptly ended.
[00:03:22.157 --> 00:03:25.019]  After about 10 minutes when she couldn't stop coughing.
[00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:32.284]  So she was asked a few softball questions, which gave her the perfect opportunity, which is what Hillary Clinton loves.
[00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:34.826]  She loves to be able to control the Q&A sessions.
[00:03:35.306 --> 00:03:39.809]  So they threw some softballs out of which she could throw out these crazy conspiracy theories.
[00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.452]  Once again, she made the claims that the Russian government is seeking to influence the U.S.
[00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:48.214]  election through cyber attacks and hacking.
[00:03:48.294 --> 00:04:00.702]  Immediately, she attempted to link Donald Trump to that alleged activity, saying, interesting that this activity happened around the time Trump became the nominee raises even more serious questions about Trump.
[00:04:01.182 --> 00:04:03.683]  Mmm, she sounds like a conspiracy theorist.
[00:04:03.723 --> 00:04:05.844]  Where's your tinfoil hat, Hillary?
[00:04:06.525 --> 00:04:12.208]  So then they also kind of went on to say, are you going to close Guantanamo Bay if you get elected?
[00:04:12.268 --> 00:04:18.971]  Which that's an absurd question to ask her considering the scale of scandal that she is mired in.
[00:04:19.371 --> 00:04:24.754]  And not to mention that Obama is doing a really good job at clearing the place out of these potential jihadis.
[00:04:25.534 --> 00:04:26.535]  They also went on to
[00:04:27.555 --> 00:04:32.378]  Asked her one question of substance was asked concerning her private email server.
[00:04:32.718 --> 00:04:44.325]  One of the reporters asked her about the claims that Hillary had her server wiped with a sophisticated program known as Bleach Bit, which of course then Clinton responded, I don't know anything about that.
[00:04:45.646 --> 00:04:47.267]  Claim to be completely ignorant of it.
[00:04:47.528 --> 00:04:49.409]  That was not something I was aware of.
[00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:57.275]  And I think the fact to point out that there was no connection, it wasn't something as far as I understand that was related.
[00:04:57.295 --> 00:05:03.680]  Oh yeah, having your server wiped with bleach bit, annihilating everything that was on your private server.
[00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:10.926]  The issue with that is that this took place three weeks after she made that claim to the American people.
[00:05:11.386 --> 00:05:13.207]  I've already told them to release my emails.
[00:05:13.367 --> 00:05:15.469]  I want America to see what was on my server.
[00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:16.270]  Right.
[00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.072]  And that's why you had one of your aides completely wipe it away with bleach bit.
[00:05:21.173 --> 00:05:31.080]  And this is after she's made repeated claims that she turned over all of her work-related emails to the State Department, which we now find out that indeed she did not.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.141]  There were thousands that she did not turn over.
[00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:35.863]  And, you know, they just let that go.
[00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:39.845]  She made that response to the question and they didn't push her further on that.
[00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.607]  And that's why
[00:05:42.407 --> 00:05:52.375]  We have to be able to have these press conferences, actual press conferences, where she can't control the questions that are being lobbied at her and so she needs to respond and continue to be pressed on this.
[00:05:52.835 --> 00:05:59.520]  And then here, excruciating irony, they asked her about the conspiracy theories surrounding her health.
[00:06:00.001 --> 00:06:02.823]  She said, I'm not concerned about those conspiracy theories.
[00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:04.464]  I pay no attention to them.
[00:06:04.824 --> 00:06:11.169]  And that was just minutes before she had to stop the Q&A session because she could not stop coughing, hacking.
[00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:21.538]  Okay, and just as she did earlier in the day there, Millie Weaver got that on Periscope for about four minutes of like tremendous hacking.
[00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:23.160]  So we'll get to that later.
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.665]  But now, in spite of the Labor Day dump, we told you that this is what they do whenever there's a big holiday weekend.
[00:06:29.725 --> 00:06:37.092]  They put out more of the emails and more things related to Hillary Clinton because we see this collusion and cover-up from all angles.
[00:06:37.552 --> 00:06:43.036]  Well, now the Trump campaign is calling on the FBI to make the additional Clinton email investigation records public.
[00:06:44.117 --> 00:07:00.408]  The campaign manager says, not only do the FBI interview notes underscore Hillary Clinton's terrible judgment, incompetence, and dishonesty, they raise serious questions about whether emails regarding the terrorist attack in Benghazi were intentionally destroyed while under congressional subpoena.
[00:07:00.728 --> 00:07:02.129]  According to the FBI's notes,
[00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:12.054]  An intense round of deleting began weeks after lawmakers subpoenaed Clinton's emails following the New York Times report exposing her secret server.
[00:07:12.434 --> 00:07:14.035]  So they give you the key dates there.
[00:07:14.075 --> 00:07:21.678]  If you scroll down, you can see that on March 2nd of 2015, the New York Times reported on the existence of Clinton's private email system.
[00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:27.281]  Immediately following that report, the Benghazi committee subpoenaed emails from Clinton's private server.
[00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:28.522]  And then on March 9th,
[00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:44.515]  Uh, Cheryl Mills sent over this preservation request, but on the 25th, so on the 25th, the company that's handling Clinton's private server, Platte River Networks, holds a conference call with Bill Clinton's staff, and then following that, sometime there, an aide
[00:07:45.616 --> 00:07:48.737]  Wiped the server clean with bleach bit.
[00:07:48.797 --> 00:07:50.578]  That deleted all of her emails.
[00:07:50.618 --> 00:07:53.959]  So now of course the GOP is pursuing obstruction of justice.
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.980]  They're saying was there some obstruction of justice there?
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.121]  Of course there was.
[00:07:57.461 --> 00:07:58.821]  We're seeing that repeatedly.
[00:07:59.302 --> 00:08:07.405]  And now some newly released emails suggest that a top Hillary Clinton aide actually stage-managed the first hearing on the Benghazi terrorist attack.
[00:08:07.745 --> 00:08:09.746]  They were feeding specific topics
[00:08:10.146 --> 00:08:10.386]  I think so.
[00:08:29.774 --> 00:08:29.994]  I think.
[00:08:49.429 --> 00:09:00.192]  You know, give her the opportunity to clear her name and make this look good, not to actually get to the bottom of things, but to feed her questions so she can give a response, just like with these Q&A sessions.
[00:09:00.852 --> 00:09:11.935]  And here also in this FBI emails, we've learned that several of Hillary Clinton's aides told the FBI that they were unaware of the former Secretary of State's private email server.
[00:09:12.675 --> 00:09:23.662]  But a Daily Caller review of the public documents revealed that at least two of the aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, were involved in multiple email exchanges in which Clinton's server was discussed.
[00:09:23.682 --> 00:09:29.806]  So there's no way that these top aides there at the State Department had no idea she was using this private server.
[00:09:31.066 --> 00:09:39.691]  More collusion, a DOJ official who led the independent Clinton email probe is actually a big-time donor to Obama.
[00:09:40.172 --> 00:09:43.393]  So this is someone who's supposed to be thoroughly independent.
[00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:51.598]  He's part of the government's investigation into her email practices, but he's contributing to President Obama's presidential campaign.
[00:09:51.738 --> 00:09:53.639]  That is David H. Loffman.
[00:09:56.149 --> 00:10:00.551]  It's just the whole system is rigged, and this is even after President Obama says, rigged?
[00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:01.491]  What does that even mean?
[00:10:01.571 --> 00:10:02.351]  Who would do that?
[00:10:02.451 --> 00:10:04.672]  So back to these Russian conspiracy theories.
[00:10:05.713 --> 00:10:11.555]  Now intelligence agencies are accusing Russia of conducting a broad, covert operation in the U.S.
[00:10:11.575 --> 00:10:13.496]  to sow public distrust.
[00:10:14.076 --> 00:10:14.176]  Yes.
[00:10:33.729 --> 00:10:37.672]  Clearly, it's actually the White House that's pushing these conspiracy theories.
[00:10:37.972 --> 00:10:44.216]  The intelligence official says they have no definitive proof of Russia tampering with the coming elections.
[00:10:44.797 --> 00:10:55.964]  And additionally, the Washington Post refers to the Russian government hack of the DNC, yet in the same sentence notes the hack has not been officially ascribed by the U.S.
[00:10:55.984 --> 00:10:56.705]  government to Russia.
[00:10:57.125 --> 00:11:16.656]  So they haven't officially blamed it on them, but they're going to go ahead and just put it out there in the public domain that indeed it is Russia, and indeed they are trying to sow distrust, when really, truly, it's the White House that is trying to sow distrust, because they don't want to get into the contents of these leaks showing that it was actually top-level
[00:11:17.316 --> 00:11:20.418]  Uh, agents there within the DNC that were rigging the election.
[00:11:20.518 --> 00:11:21.879]  That's what we need to be concerned about.
[00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:27.483]  But instead, they're immediately shifting the blame to this concern of the boogeyman Russia.
[00:11:27.923 --> 00:11:33.226]  And you got to feel sorry for Tim Kaine, who is Hillary Clinton's running mate there for VP.
[00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:40.711]  He's getting laughed at already because he is trying to run interference saying, you know, Hillary Clinton, she talks to the press a lot.
[00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:46.515]  She's been very transparent with the press, but obviously he doesn't understand the difference between Hillary's
[00:11:46.895 --> 00:11:54.202]  Staged events and a real unscripted open access press conference where reporters are going to be allowed to ask whatever they want.
[00:11:54.302 --> 00:11:56.264]  That's what Hillary is so afraid of.
[00:11:57.285 --> 00:12:00.968]  We've already seen the way she responds when the questions are lobbed at her.
[00:12:01.589 --> 00:12:06.393]  So he also went on to say, you know, she she made a mistake by only using one device.
[00:12:06.713 --> 00:12:07.074]  She used 13.
[00:12:07.174 --> 00:12:13.301]  Her aides tried to destroy these 13 devices with actual hammers.
[00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:14.682]  They tried to break these.
[00:12:14.983 --> 00:12:19.708]  So then he goes on to say, well, Hillary wants the people to have access to the information.
[00:12:19.748 --> 00:12:20.949]  She wants it to be public.
[00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.854]  Despite the whole hammers and deleting the emails thing with bleach bit.
[00:12:26.515 --> 00:12:29.278]  And of course, back to the hacking Hillary.
[00:12:29.678 --> 00:12:35.304]  The media was caught in a blatant lie trying to say that the pollen count was really high in the area that day.
[00:12:35.404 --> 00:12:36.746]  Oh, it's just allergy season.
[00:12:37.186 --> 00:12:39.569]  Hillary Clinton joked about being allergic to Donald Trump.
[00:12:40.129 --> 00:12:41.230]  And you know,
[00:12:42.131 --> 00:12:54.219]  I guess they don't understand that there are websites that actually track the daily allergen level, which confirmed that grass pollen was low, tree pollen was low, ragweed pollen was moderate, allergens were not high.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:02.565]  So of course it doesn't explain the exact same coughing fit that Hillary Clinton has had on multiple occasions.
[00:13:03.025 --> 00:13:08.589]  And as Trump's campaign manager says on Hillary's coughing, she must be allergic to the media.
[00:13:08.969 --> 00:13:10.671]  And that's what was getting her off.
[00:13:11.551 --> 00:13:25.060]  And now, get this, now that everyone's really digging in with what was actually going on with the pay to play there with the Clinton Foundation, Hillary says that it is appropriate that Bill Clinton will cut ties with the foundation if she becomes the president.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.582]  She's not going to comment just yet on Chelsea's involvement.
[00:13:27.602 --> 00:13:29.983]  She says, you know, we'll get there if I'm elected.
[00:13:30.404 --> 00:13:40.390]  But, you know, if it was wrong, if it's wrong, if she becomes the president for the Bill Clinton to have such close ties with the foundation, well, what was the deal with being secretary of state?
[00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.271]  Why was it OK then?
[00:13:46.853 --> 00:13:51.895]  We are spiraling headlong into what amounts to the final two months of the presidential race.
[00:13:52.115 --> 00:13:54.936]  But where is Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton?
[00:13:55.116 --> 00:13:57.657]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:13:57.917 --> 00:14:03.339]  Days ago, Hillary Clinton had not held a press conference in 274 days.
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:08.181]  That's right, Hillary Clinton had not held a press conference in all of 2016, an election year.
[00:14:10.462 --> 00:14:18.766]  Until this sham, Hillary, surrounding yourself with what amounts to the press corps over at Teen Beat, doesn't amount to a press conference.
[00:14:19.166 --> 00:14:20.387]  Why has she been absent?
[00:14:20.707 --> 00:14:26.910]  It's obvious that Hillary's frail health can't deal with the monumental deviance that is her growing email scandal.
[00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:42.797]  More damning evidence came to light as the architect of the email cover-up, former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, clearly obstructed the FBI's investigation by deleting emails with .com addresses, only saving the emails with .gov or .mil.
[00:14:43.957 --> 00:14:51.004]  Eliminating all of Clinton's then Chief of Staff Uma Abedin's, Mills' and other aides' correspondence between Clinton.
[00:14:51.164 --> 00:14:58.651]  Judicial Watch President Tom Linton said the FBI saw massive document destruction and clear intent to withhold material evidence.
[00:14:58.871 --> 00:15:03.355]  He added, and they just ignored that obstruction and even let her sit in on the interview.
[00:15:03.656 --> 00:15:22.494]  Correspondence between Clinton and Abedin, who regularly emailed her boss from Uma at ClintonEmail.com and H. Abedin at HillaryClinton.com, is crucial, Fitton said, because Abedin acted as the go-between on requests for access to Clinton from shady foreign Clinton Foundation donors.
[00:15:22.694 --> 00:15:31.620]  He says the mushrooming pay-for-play scandal is the real reason the former Secretary of State set up a private email system in the first place.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.684]  The whole thing was designed to keep Clinton Foundation emails from investigators, he said.
[00:15:37.124 --> 00:15:47.451]  Meanwhile, as Donald Trump becomes increasingly presidential, reaching out to the Mexican people, the flood victims in Louisiana, and the forgotten manufacturing corpse of Detroit
[00:15:47.611 --> 00:15:55.015]  Hillary is elsewhere, preferring to rub elbows with those she is truly comfortable with and serving, the ultra-rich.
[00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:59.037]  Trump wants to cut taxes for the super-rich.
[00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:05.671]  Well, we're not going there, my friends.
[00:16:06.512 --> 00:16:14.739]  I'm telling you right now, we're going to write fairer rules for the middle class and we are going to raise taxes on the middle class!
[00:16:14.999 --> 00:16:23.627]  Hillary has been jet-setting from one elitist fundraiser after another and is taking pre-written questions from children to the tune of $2,700 apiece.
[00:16:25.971 --> 00:16:34.414]  Mr. President, what is your plan to connect mental health problems and guns to make sure that me, my brothers and my friends are safe from violence at school?
[00:16:34.654 --> 00:16:39.455]  I think we need to pass some laws that I have been advocating for.
[00:16:39.475 --> 00:16:42.056]  We need comprehensive background checks.
[00:16:42.116 --> 00:16:44.097]  We need to close the gun show loophole.
[00:16:44.197 --> 00:16:46.338]  Close the online loophole.
[00:16:46.378 --> 00:16:50.659]  The gun lobby lives off of fear and misinformation.
[00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:58.503]  Open Secrets reveals Trump has raised $127.6 million, 2% of that coming from Super PACs and 98% from campaign donations, while Hillary has raised $435.3 million, 28% from Super PACs and 72% from donations.
[00:16:58.523 --> 00:17:03.046]  Hillary is clearly the Wall Street candidate and is propped up by a corporatocracy that has infested our republic.
[00:17:17.094 --> 00:17:24.857]  Meanwhile, the dying mainstream media continues to whitewash her poor health, absence from duty, and her own bungling of the issues.
[00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:33.219]  Her popularity ratings are sinking right now, and I'm not sure they're sinking because she's campaigning too little or too ineffectively, or because she's campaigning too much.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.641]  I sort of suspect the latter, and that she'd do better if she was even quieter than she is now.
[00:17:37.941 --> 00:17:51.175]  And the media continues to fall on its sword, going with the narrative of total propaganda, as was in the case of the Huffington Post article titled, Conspiracy Theorist Alex Jones Boasts About Advising Donald Trump.
[00:17:51.475 --> 00:18:00.685]  Editors note, Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, and birther.
[00:18:00.925 --> 00:18:08.709]  Who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims, 1.6 billion members of an entire religion, from entering the United States.
[00:18:08.909 --> 00:18:22.695]  This is what we can expect from a completely propagandized media as it protects the globalist choice and possibly sickest candidate since William Henry Harrison in an attempt to enter the Oval Office.
[00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.796]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:18:33.638 --> 00:18:34.680]  I'm running for president.
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.285]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:18:38.545 --> 00:18:42.692]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:19:12.199 --> 00:19:15.863]  He who controls the trends, controls the future.
[00:19:16.683 --> 00:19:20.787]  He who controls the future, controls the destiny of humanity.
[00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:34.321]  My friends, the globalist social engineers are obsessed with creating false memes, false trends that they control.
[00:19:36.929 --> 00:19:44.792]  To create a population of trendies from those false trends that don't have their own destiny.
[00:19:45.752 --> 00:20:01.477]  Who don't even have a basic organic human genetic drive to build something that is satisfying, trailblazing, and innately independent and human.
[00:20:02.492 --> 00:20:07.116]  And if you understand this paradigm, you understand all the others.
[00:20:07.657 --> 00:20:20.369]  One of hundreds of memes and trends we've been successfully able to launch and force into the consciousness is a Operation Against Hillary Clinton we launched 10 months ago with the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.072]  It's now been duplicated by countless groups and I think that's wonderful.
[00:20:25.034 --> 00:20:31.958]  Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and now it's all over CNN, it's all over Fox, it's all over the Trump rallies, the Hillary rallies.
[00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:39.383]  The number one search term for a week straight, last week, and still continuing, one of the top search terms is, is Hillary going to jail?
[00:20:39.723 --> 00:20:41.825]  This has been incredibly successful.
[00:20:42.105 --> 00:20:46.468]  Because it shows, despite corporate control, and despite them trying to control the meme,
[00:20:47.068 --> 00:21:03.960]  We are able to synergistically wear our colors loud and proud against injustice, corruption, and oppression, and show that we, humans, not the globalist controllers, but the common little people, can set the trends, can set the memes.
[00:21:04.821 --> 00:21:07.142]  We've had three versions of the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[00:21:07.662 --> 00:21:11.083]  All of them have been collector's edition and have helped fund the InfoWar.
[00:21:11.664 --> 00:21:14.225]  We now have a third edition in.
[00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:15.785]  The second edition sold out.
[00:21:16.145 --> 00:21:32.692]  It's the same as the last, but on the right shoulder says InfoWars.com, on the back it says InfoWars.com, legalized freedom, be part of history, be part of supporting the InfoWar, be part of meeting like-minded friends and family.
[00:21:33.809 --> 00:21:49.114]  And be part of breaking out of their paradigm and setting the agenda, setting the trend, setting the true, organic, teleprompter-free reawakening of humanity.

[00:22:03.054 --> 00:22:03.655]  Just a little.
[00:22:03.935 --> 00:22:04.736]  Just a little sip.
[00:22:05.297 --> 00:22:05.597]  Open up.
[00:22:05.897 --> 00:22:06.778]  Come on, take it!
[00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:07.679]  Take it!
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.401]  I'm running for president.
[00:22:09.802 --> 00:22:12.986]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:22:13.006 --> 00:22:17.431]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:23:07.242 --> 00:23:09.104]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:23:09.124 --> 00:23:14.529]  Now, President Barack Obama has been considered one of the most disrespected presidents of all time.
[00:23:15.189 --> 00:23:17.231]  A lot of people say it's because he's a black man.
[00:23:18.032 --> 00:23:19.533]  You know, I'm not going for that.
[00:23:19.893 --> 00:23:22.175]  I think it's because he is a failed president.
[00:23:22.916 --> 00:23:24.357]  Obamacare, a failure.
[00:23:24.677 --> 00:23:30.282]  The fact that he can't even go and visit with the people in a timely manner in Louisiana.
[00:23:30.522 --> 00:23:32.083]  Instead, he's too busy playing golf.
[00:23:32.143 --> 00:23:42.751]  Meanwhile, Donald Trump goes down there and gets the job done quickly, and he gets it done actually by handing out stuff, helping out the people, showing that he cares.
[00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:50.458]  President Barack Obama this weekend actually went to Laos late Monday night to become the first U.S.
[00:23:50.518 --> 00:23:54.263]  President ever to visit the Southeast Asian country.
[00:23:54.743 --> 00:23:59.189]  He encountered more than his usual share of friction and confrontation on his 10th
[00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:01.791]  And who do you think is going to chime in on this situation?
[00:24:27.538 --> 00:24:28.259]  Donald Trump.
[00:24:28.779 --> 00:24:38.429]  Donald Trump tweeted out this weekend, China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines president calls Obama the son of a whore.
[00:24:38.889 --> 00:24:39.330]  Terrible.
[00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:40.471]  Another tweet.
[00:24:40.831 --> 00:24:45.035]  Can you believe that the Chinese would not give Obama the proper stairway to get off his plane?
[00:24:45.295 --> 00:24:51.742]  Donald Trump also said that he would have refused to meet with the Chinese officials if they treated him like they treated Mr. Obama.
[00:24:52.745 --> 00:24:56.749]  Donald Trump then said, if that were me, I'd say, you know what, folks, I respect you a lot.
[00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.950]  Let's close these doors.
[00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.731]  Let's get out of here.
[00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:05.057]  Mr. Obama downplayed the episode like he always does and pretty much blew it off like nothing happened at all.
[00:25:05.317 --> 00:25:08.820]  Also, there were running verbal battles between Chinese and U.S.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.382]  officials and U.S.
[00:25:10.422 --> 00:25:11.923]  journalists at the G20 summit.
[00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:23.653]  A Chinese official tried to block White House National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice from moving closer to Mr. Obama at the airport, forcing a Secret Service agent to intervene.
[00:25:24.774 --> 00:25:27.476]  Now this leads me to another article by the New York Post.
[00:25:27.996 --> 00:25:28.837]  This is our country.
[00:25:28.897 --> 00:25:31.139]  Tempers flare as Obama arrives in China.
[00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:41.668]  On the tarmac, a quarrel broke out between a presidential aide and a Chinese official who demanded the journalists traveling with Obama be prohibited from getting anywhere near him.
[00:25:42.108 --> 00:25:47.593]  It was a breach of the tradition observed whenever the American president arrives in a foreign place.
[00:25:47.994 --> 00:25:50.416]  When the White House official insisted the U.S.
[00:25:50.456 --> 00:25:59.084]  would set the rules for its own leader, her Chinese counterpart shot back, this is our country, this is our airport, the Chinese official yelled.
[00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:03.948]  So you can see simply that people do not have respect for America like they used to.
[00:26:04.168 --> 00:26:06.410]  And that's what we need, a true leader.
[00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.373]  That's why the populace is Donald Trump.
[00:26:09.413 --> 00:26:16.399]  That's why people are standing in line for hours and hours upon the thousands to go listen to this man speak.
[00:26:16.679 --> 00:26:22.204]  Because we're tired of having a president that is disrespected by countries all over the world.
[00:26:22.705 --> 00:26:24.827]  That is not going to happen under Donald Trump.
[00:26:25.367 --> 00:26:36.841]  Before leaving China, Mr. Obama held what's likely to be his final meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has bedeviled Mr. Obama virtually since day one.
[00:26:37.202 --> 00:26:44.211]  They talked about a ceasefire in Syria, where Russia supports the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, but reached no conclusion.
[00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:49.356]  Then they discussed Russia's aggression in Ukraine, but reached no conclusion.
[00:26:49.796 --> 00:26:57.483]  And yet again, Mr. Trump fires back with another tweet, giving his opinion on about what he thinks took place.
[00:26:58.104 --> 00:27:00.746]  President Obama and Putin fail to reach a deal on Syria.
[00:27:01.227 --> 00:27:03.148]  Obama is not a natural dealmaker.
[00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:05.331]  He only makes bad deals.
[00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:12.075]  Amid all the friction, Mr. Obama did make progress on one of his prime legacy goals, formally entering the U.S.
[00:27:12.095 --> 00:27:17.298]  with China into the Paris Climate Change Agreement to reduce carbon emissions globally.
[00:27:17.819 --> 00:27:30.327]  In Laos, Mr. Obama was to hold his first meeting with new Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, but the White House canceled it after the Philippine leader called Mr. Obama a son of a bitch on Monday.
[00:27:31.451 --> 00:27:35.473]  You must be disrespectful, Mr. Duterte said of Mr. Obama.
[00:27:35.793 --> 00:27:38.474]  Do not just throw away questions and statements, son of a bitch.
[00:27:38.814 --> 00:27:40.475]  I will curse you in that form.
[00:27:40.755 --> 00:27:44.357]  We will be wallowing in the mud like pigs if you do that to me.
[00:27:44.977 --> 00:27:50.259]  As you can see, President Barack Obama is not respected by many foreign leaders.
[00:27:50.679 --> 00:28:00.844]  It's time to get someone in the White House who will be respected, someone who's going to work for the American people, someone who's going to listen to the American people, and someone who's finally going to straighten this country up.
[00:28:01.205 --> 00:28:03.239]  Stay tuned for more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:04.005]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:28:14.144 --> 00:28:22.647]  Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump is now surging in the polls and he has just received what might be his strongest endorsement yet.
[00:28:23.247 --> 00:28:31.570]  In an open letter from the military leaders, 88 former military leaders have just voiced their public support for Donald Trump.
[00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:42.234]  The strong statement reads, the 2016 election affords the American people an urgently needed opportunity to make a long overdue course correction in our national security posture and policy.
[00:28:42.774 --> 00:28:57.618]  As retired senior leaders of America's military, we believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with and substantially responsible for the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world.
[00:28:57.918 --> 00:29:02.619]  For this reason, we support Donald Trump's candidacy to be our next Commander-in-Chief.
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:11.842]  Not only are these strong words of support for Donald Trump, this is actually also a knock on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, who are responsible
[00:29:12.222 --> 00:29:16.307]  For the unrest in the Middle East and the purging of the military.
[00:29:16.587 --> 00:29:17.488]  The statement goes on.
[00:29:18.553 --> 00:29:22.975]  In our professional judgment, the combined effect is potentially extremely perilous.
[00:29:23.275 --> 00:29:30.577]  That is especially the case if our government persists in the practices and people that have brought us to this present pass.
[00:29:30.877 --> 00:29:41.201]  For this reason, we support Donald Trump and his commitment to rebuild our military, to secure our borders, to defeat our Islamic supremacist adversaries, and restore law and order domestically.
[00:29:41.481 --> 00:29:44.162]  We urge our fellow Americans to do the same.
[00:29:44.742 --> 00:29:56.231]  Now this is the same message that Donald Trump and Mike Flynn encouraged in Virginia today, asking people to get their family and friends to get out to the polls and vote Donald Trump.
[00:29:56.712 --> 00:30:00.215]  Is this Donald Trump's greatest endorsement yet?
[00:30:01.195 --> 00:30:03.097]  This shows that Donald Trump is not alone.
[00:30:03.357 --> 00:30:09.082]  He has support from the military in his efforts and in his foreign policy.
[00:30:10.063 --> 00:30:10.243]  Now,
[00:30:11.883 --> 00:30:23.166]  Remo Butler, a retired Brigadier General, went on Fox and CNN today, voicing his support for Trump, but he also took the conversation in a different direction.
[00:30:23.406 --> 00:30:27.027]  It was a big decision point to come on CNN and do this.
[00:30:28.508 --> 00:30:30.108]  And I do appreciate your being there.
[00:30:30.268 --> 00:30:31.968]  Especially as a black man.
[00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.849]  Why is that?
[00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:35.890]  The media sets the tone.
[00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:41.211]  If you watch the media and you watch TV, you would think that all black people,
[00:30:41.718 --> 00:30:48.803]  We're on welfare, we live in the ghetto, we're so afraid of getting shot, and we wear our hair in dreadlocks.
[00:30:49.403 --> 00:31:05.455]  So to me, that means that Remo Butler is not just supporting Donald Trump as a former member of the military, but also as a black American citizen who is sick and tired of the mainstream media determining how the black voter should feel.
[00:31:06.627 --> 00:31:09.509]  Now, is this Trump's greatest endorsement?
[00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:15.914]  Are we going to see the military and black people in America coming out for support of Donald Trump?
[00:31:16.194 --> 00:31:17.595]  Right now, the polls are showing it.
[00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:25.081]  CNN and Fox both had to admit today that Donald Trump now leads Hillary Clinton in the polls.
[00:31:25.381 --> 00:31:30.065]  Of course, the Washington Post is still running with the false narrative that Hillary Clinton
[00:31:30.345 --> 00:31:32.950]  has the lead over Donald Trump.
[00:31:33.251 --> 00:31:37.840]  For more coverage on the 2016 election, visit InfoWars.com.
[00:31:43.672 --> 00:31:47.153]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:31:47.213 --> 00:31:50.614]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:31:50.674 --> 00:31:55.496]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:31:55.636 --> 00:31:58.417]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:31:58.537 --> 00:32:04.459]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:32:04.679 --> 00:32:08.260]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:32:08.701 --> 00:32:11.281]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:32:11.382 --> 00:32:19.905]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:32:20.945 --> 00:32:29.687]  ...is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:32:29.787 --> 00:32:34.928]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:32:35.448 --> 00:32:39.028]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:32:39.208 --> 00:32:41.249]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:32:41.329 --> 00:32:43.729]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:46.170]  Know your history and you will know your enemy.
[00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:47.610]  InfoWars.com

[00:33:13.175 --> 00:33:13.635]  30 servings.

[00:33:16.737 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.857 --> 00:33:18.798]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all of the essential amino acids, all of the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.686]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.026 --> 00:36:46.687]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.888 --> 00:36:53.009]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.

[00:37:04.545 --> 00:37:06.546]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:37:06.586 --> 00:37:09.368]  Conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly dead at 92.
[00:37:09.929 --> 00:37:12.890]  She is and was an icon of human liberty, said Alex Jones.
[00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:17.493]  Without trailblazers like her, we would have no chance against the forces of tyranny.
[00:37:18.054 --> 00:37:31.202]  Schlafly, a formidable pro-family grassroots organizer who was politically active for 70 years, founded the Conservative Eagle Forum in 1972 and served as president since then, overseeing the organization's rise to 80,000 members today.
[00:37:32.443 --> 00:37:39.126]  Her focus from her earliest days until her final ones was protecting the family, which she understood as the building block of life.
[00:37:39.506 --> 00:37:45.289]  The Eagle Forum said in a statement she recognized America as the greatest political embodiment of those values.
[00:37:45.749 --> 00:37:56.714]  From military superiority and defense to immigration and trade, from unborn life to the nuclear family and parenthood, Phyllis Schlafly was a courageous and articulate voice for common sense and traditional values.
[00:37:57.035 --> 00:37:59.176]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:38:05.727 --> 00:38:11.130]  Well, with everyone getting back to school, you probably feel that exciting energy in the air.
[00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:16.953]  Ah, time to expand your cultural horizons, meet new people that you might not ever have been friends with.
[00:38:17.574 --> 00:38:17.974]  But no.
[00:38:18.374 --> 00:38:28.340]  In today's age, now it's all about compartmentalization, putting people in their special little groups, not allowing any sort of commingling with anyone that might trigger you or offend you.
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.843]  Ashley Beckford joins me now so we can talk a little bit about this.
[00:38:32.203 --> 00:38:34.925]  It's not about equality anymore and everyone kind of joining together.
[00:38:34.965 --> 00:38:39.570]  It's all about superiority and the superiority of your special little victim class.
[00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.151]  That's exactly right, Leanne.
[00:38:41.191 --> 00:38:44.894]  What it's all about today is a culture of victimization.
[00:38:44.974 --> 00:38:55.584]  It's no longer, you know, we're all trying to understand each other and kind of get into our, you know, cohesive group like what brings us to this city if we're in a particular college or
[00:38:56.064 --> 00:38:59.185]  What brings us to this university?
[00:38:59.505 --> 00:39:03.287]  It's all about, let's get into our culture of victimization.
[00:39:03.607 --> 00:39:06.188]  Let's see how many points we have on the victim scale.
[00:39:06.528 --> 00:39:17.093]  And let's see, you know, well, also it's racist and you might trigger someone if you ask them where they're from, because, you know, then you're insinuating that they're not from the United States, right?
[00:39:17.153 --> 00:39:18.113]  That's racist.
[00:39:18.233 --> 00:39:19.514]  You can't even have conversations.
[00:39:21.035 --> 00:39:24.338]  Microaggressions are the big thing that we're going to talk about today.
[00:39:24.358 --> 00:39:27.140]  It's happening all over the country and really the world.
[00:39:27.341 --> 00:39:27.541]  Right.
[00:39:27.741 --> 00:39:36.449]  And so one of the big stories out right now is that California State University in Los Angeles, they just rolled out segregated housing for black students.
[00:39:36.909 --> 00:39:37.989]  So this is an arrangement.
[00:39:38.029 --> 00:39:53.315]  It comes just about nine months after the university's Black Student Union issued a set of demands in response to what its members contend are frequent racist attacks on campus such as racially insensitive remarks and microaggressions by professors and students.
[00:39:53.855 --> 00:40:08.500]  And so now, rather than having students get to know each other, you know, get to co-mingle with people they might never have become friends with, never have struck up conversations with, they want to provide a safe space where they can connect and learn from each other.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.841]  Which is just ridiculous because it's like you have no safe space.
[00:40:13.161 --> 00:40:23.163]  In the real world, you actually have to be out there interacting with people of all different types of, you know, ethnic backgrounds, all different types of socio-economic backgrounds.
[00:40:23.563 --> 00:40:36.987]  And I don't agree with the socialist ideology that says that basically everything is class struggle, everything is oppression, so you need to see oppression in every single moment of your life.
[00:40:37.187 --> 00:40:38.287]  That's basically what it's about.
[00:40:38.647 --> 00:40:45.374]  Exactly, and this is not a historically black college, so why are you now segregating a university?
[00:40:45.594 --> 00:40:51.560]  If you wanted to be segregated, go to a historically black college if that's the kind of experience that you seek.
[00:40:52.181 --> 00:40:56.506]  But now because of these demands, they're completely rearranging the way that
[00:40:57.026 --> 00:40:58.027]  Students are learning.
[00:40:58.407 --> 00:41:16.079]  And now, rather than with this freshman orientation where they would normally talk them through tutorials on campus technology, give them advice on how to choose classes, now it's all about these identity politics and training them not to commit any offensive microaggressions.
[00:41:16.119 --> 00:41:17.280]  That's exactly right.
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.542]  They want to get them when they're really young.
[00:41:19.582 --> 00:41:21.504]  They want to get them when they first get in there.
[00:41:21.564 --> 00:41:33.876]  And instead of teaching them about how to interact, you know, cross-culturally, which is typically what you would learn, they're actually teaching them how to segregate themselves into these little cliques.
[00:41:33.996 --> 00:41:37.500]  And it basically takes away from that whole idea of diversity.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.302]  It's really the exact opposite.
[00:41:39.733 --> 00:41:49.237]  I am just so thankful that I graduated before I would have had to take this freshman orientation against safe spaces, trigger warnings.
[00:41:49.297 --> 00:41:53.739]  It's the whole new campus vocabulary on subtle microaggressions.
[00:41:54.059 --> 00:41:57.580]  Just about everything you do could be considered a subtle microaggression.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.540]  So what is that?
[00:41:58.761 --> 00:42:03.622]  These are comments, snubs, or insults that communicate derogatory or negative messages.
[00:42:03.642 --> 00:42:04.683]  It might not be intended.
[00:42:05.283 --> 00:42:05.924]  We're good to go.
[00:42:21.696 --> 00:42:22.597]  Microaggressions.
[00:42:22.657 --> 00:42:24.178]  Environmental microaggressions.
[00:42:24.758 --> 00:42:26.460]  You enter the chemistry building.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.681]  They're taking it into the STEM courses now, too.
[00:42:29.202 --> 00:42:32.144]  And you see all the pictures are of males.
[00:42:32.344 --> 00:42:36.987]  So if you're a female, like me or Leanne, you're going to feel that you're not welcome.
[00:42:37.027 --> 00:42:38.088]  You're not represented.
[00:42:38.168 --> 00:42:39.069]  That's ridiculous.
[00:42:39.449 --> 00:42:44.513]  It just so happens that a lot of the scientific developments have been created through white males.
[00:42:45.894 --> 00:42:47.855]  And then you have microinvalidation.
[00:42:47.895 --> 00:42:48.576]  They're saying that
[00:42:50.257 --> 00:42:59.620]  Just merely suggesting that your race or your ethnic background actually did not play that great of a role in planning out your life.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.200]  That's a micro-invalidation.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:08.042]  That's saying, you know, you're not able to... Everyone can succeed in this society if they work hard enough.
[00:43:08.262 --> 00:43:10.002]  That's racist!
[00:43:10.042 --> 00:43:11.403]  That's racist, exactly.
[00:43:11.423 --> 00:43:12.263]  That's a micro-aggression.
[00:43:12.343 --> 00:43:14.764]  And here we're actually starting to see some of these
[00:43:16.064 --> 00:43:16.284]  Wow.
[00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:36.390]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:47.153]  He was forced out because he noted on a local Black Lives Matter organizer's Facebook page that, among other things, students won't quit gaming, setting up fights, and selling drugs.
[00:43:47.533 --> 00:43:53.655]  So, because he says this and he's like, hey guys, you know, let's try to clean up what's actually the problem here, what's going on,
[00:43:54.315 --> 00:43:59.858]  They dubbed him a white supremacist teacher, and there's no coming back from that.
[00:43:59.878 --> 00:44:02.379]  And they forced him to go through sensitivity training.
[00:44:02.419 --> 00:44:04.960]  They forced him to go through equity training, they call it.
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.962]  Everything's equal, everything's loving, like Harrison Bergeron.
[00:44:09.602 --> 00:44:10.903]  You know, the island.
[00:44:11.023 --> 00:44:16.287]  Well, God forbid the school district tries to actually do something about what this teacher is complaining about.
[00:44:16.367 --> 00:44:24.073]  The fights, the gaming, the selling drugs, which I mean, I know growing up, I saw that kind of going on in my school, so I can't even imagine how it is now.
[00:44:24.513 --> 00:44:30.778]  And if you even dare say anything about that, I mean, you're trying to create a safe environment for the other students that are there wanting to learn.
[00:44:31.358 --> 00:44:32.619]  Exactly.
[00:44:32.719 --> 00:44:35.640]  It's almost impossible to be a teacher nowadays.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:41.142]  There's so many people, great teachers, quitting the profession because of what's going on in the schools right now.
[00:44:42.022 --> 00:44:50.285]  And now we've actually seen, I know David Knight spoke a little bit more on this about where this is really coming from, but we see the government spending $500,000 fighting online trolls.
[00:44:53.066 --> 00:45:08.733]  Well, and the issue here is, like, people, they get online, they're so oppressed here in their speech, in the universities, in school, and in their daily lives, that they get online and they have this sort of sense of anonymity, so that they're going to say whatever they might never say to your face, but they're going to say it online.
[00:45:08.773 --> 00:45:10.894]  They're going to take that away, even from people.
[00:45:10.934 --> 00:45:16.216]  They're going to take that away where you can't even, you know, communicate because they're going to have the internet ideas.
[00:45:16.276 --> 00:45:20.298]  We know October 1st, ICANN is being transferred to the UN here.
[00:45:20.658 --> 00:45:20.858]  Right.
[00:45:20.898 --> 00:45:24.641]  So, uh, yeah, it's only going to get worse for me right now.
[00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:33.146]  And that's kind of the thing is they're indoctrinating the students while they've got them there in the schools because this is the new, the new reality that people are going to be living in.
[00:45:33.486 --> 00:45:37.409]  And you can see it here unfolding with this election, this current election season.
[00:45:37.449 --> 00:45:44.434]  It's all about identity politics when it's like, it doesn't matter what special group you belong to when we're all getting screwed.
[00:45:44.734 --> 00:45:49.197]  When everyone's out of a job, it doesn't matter who you are, how victimized we're all.
[00:45:49.657 --> 00:45:55.221]  And everyone's being censored unless you agree with the progressive politics.
[00:45:55.521 --> 00:46:00.165]  If you don't agree with the progressive politics, then you're definitely getting censored.
[00:46:00.225 --> 00:46:02.046]  Your speech means nothing, basically.
[00:46:02.166 --> 00:46:02.346]  Right.
[00:46:02.887 --> 00:46:10.052]  And just to close this up with how these groups are working to become some of the most hated groups out there,
[00:46:10.572 --> 00:46:11.173]  I don't think so.
[00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:31.433]  Because they say the climate crisis is a racist crisis.
[00:46:31.533 --> 00:46:32.194]  Cut emissions.
[00:46:32.514 --> 00:46:36.698]  So this is what this group, you know, you can't be all things to all people.
[00:46:36.778 --> 00:46:40.441]  And now this is what happens when you take that money from George Soros.
[00:46:40.781 --> 00:46:45.505]  Now you've got to fight the fight of climate change and and you know this and that.
[00:46:45.545 --> 00:46:47.367]  It's like you can't be all things to all people.
[00:46:48.809 --> 00:46:54.876]  But, you know, you're going to lock arms there on the runway, shut down the flights for climate change because Black Lives Matter.
[00:46:55.978 --> 00:46:56.758]  I don't agree with it.
[00:46:56.798 --> 00:46:57.820]  I think it's terrorism.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.725]  I don't know.
[00:49:04.343 --> 00:49:08.584]  Well, the Feds are about to spend a half million dollars to protect us from online trolls.
[00:49:08.964 --> 00:49:10.304]  That sounds like a great deal, doesn't it?
[00:49:10.745 --> 00:49:17.306]  But actually what it is, is an example of the government again creating a problem and then offering a solution.
[00:49:17.726 --> 00:49:19.867]  A solution that destroys our freedom.
[00:49:20.087 --> 00:49:23.968]  In this case, the last bastion of free speech, the Internet.
[00:49:24.448 --> 00:49:29.894]  They'll do it by not protecting us from trolls, but by creating a de facto fingerprint.
[00:49:30.194 --> 00:49:33.618]  Now, you wouldn't go to the federal government for permission to use the internet, would you?
[00:49:33.978 --> 00:49:35.400]  Most people would balk at that.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:44.990]  If the government at some point came out and said, you're going to have to register with Homeland Security and we're going to give you an ID that you'll use everywhere on the internet, most people would say, no thanks.
[00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:45.730]  Not going to do that.
[00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:46.831]  They would rebel against it.
[00:49:47.452 --> 00:49:56.374]  But what they're going to do, in the name of protecting us from trolls, is to create a de facto fingerprint, without your knowledge, without your permission.
[00:49:56.915 --> 00:49:57.795]  How is this going to work?
[00:49:58.395 --> 00:50:16.260]  Well, quite frankly, it is a tale that includes CISA, or CISPA, or SOPA, or ACTA, or PIPA, remember all of those different efforts to allow corporations to turn over our information to the government without us being allowed to sue them for violation of privacy or for terms of agreement?
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.641]  They finally got it through with CISA.
[00:50:18.821 --> 00:50:23.723]  They told us that they needed it to protect us from, you know, foreign aggressors, not from the federal government.
[00:50:24.183 --> 00:50:26.004]  And this is where they've been headed all along.
[00:50:26.044 --> 00:50:27.484]  Let's look at how this is going to break down.
[00:50:27.504 --> 00:50:33.667]  Of course, this is an article that was put out by the Daily Caller, pointing to a couple of grants that have come out.
[00:50:33.707 --> 00:50:39.029]  And of course, they say that this work is going to help to combat troll armies that are being used by Russia,
[00:50:39.329 --> 00:50:39.629]  I think so.
[00:51:00.982 --> 00:51:06.086]  Snowden told us that it was being done by the UK and of course we know that it is being done by the American government.
[00:51:06.106 --> 00:51:11.971]  You can see it if you go to the comments section on YouTube for InfoWars videos, for InfoWars articles.
[00:51:12.031 --> 00:51:13.312]  We know that this is happening.
[00:51:13.592 --> 00:51:17.535]  Now what they're telling us is that this is something that is going to protect us
[00:51:18.496 --> 00:51:28.019]  They say that they define, and here's the key, they define trolls as people who have inauthentic, biased, misleading comments that are effective.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.740]  They have to protect us from that.
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:37.062]  And so what we understand, and this is something that Aaron Schwartz warned us about before he was, I believe, killed, not committed suicide.
[00:51:37.082 --> 00:51:46.806]  He said, look, they're pushing CISPA and all these different aspects of taking over the Internet to protect us from exploits that the government itself is creating.
[00:51:47.774 --> 00:51:49.916]  And he gave examples of that.
[00:51:50.076 --> 00:51:51.738]  This is precisely what they're doing.
[00:51:51.778 --> 00:51:56.022]  They create the online trolls, the massive armies of trolls, and then say, we're going to have to take your freedom.
[00:51:56.262 --> 00:52:01.407]  And again, today we have Obama saying, we're not going to allow the internet to be like the Wild Wild West.
[00:52:02.048 --> 00:52:04.010]  As they say, they've got to protect us from these exploits.
[00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.532]  One of the things that they offer to us is Stutznet.
[00:52:07.173 --> 00:52:08.915]  That was something that was created by the U.S.
[00:52:09.155 --> 00:52:18.224]  and Israeli intelligence to destroy the centrifuges inside Iran's nuclear reactors, their projects where they were trying to create nuclear weapons.
[00:52:19.096 --> 00:52:20.017]  What happened with that?
[00:52:20.117 --> 00:52:27.983]  Well, in response to that, as they were successful in doing that, the Iranians then realized that they had to do something to respond.
[00:52:28.083 --> 00:52:32.247]  So what they did was they created an army, the fourth largest cyber army in the world.
[00:52:32.647 --> 00:52:34.869]  That's the way this always blows back.
[00:52:34.909 --> 00:52:44.017]  What we have now is an arms race on the military side, but on the civilian side, understand that all of this information, as they say in this grant, this half million dollar grant,
[00:52:44.457 --> 00:52:46.118]  This information is taken from you.
[00:52:46.238 --> 00:52:52.142]  They continually change the terms of use and people sign up for that not knowing what they're doing.
[00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:54.184]  They're going to take that very data.
[00:52:54.704 --> 00:53:01.949]  They're going to use it to create a profile just as geospatial intelligence uses your activity-based intelligence to create a profile of you.
[00:53:02.129 --> 00:53:05.171]  That's the way they're going to destroy our freedom.
[00:53:05.611 --> 00:53:08.193]  And they're going to do it in the name of protecting us from trolls.
[00:53:08.213 --> 00:53:09.214]  That's the way they always do it.
[00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:21.915]  Leaked documents from George Soros' Open Society Foundation continue to reveal the extent to which the group influenced the political response there to Europe's refugee crisis.
[00:53:21.955 --> 00:53:23.356]  Now joining me is Margaret Howell.
[00:53:23.816 --> 00:53:25.177]  Let's go ahead and break this down.
[00:53:25.557 --> 00:53:28.399]  So basically, to the tune of about $600,000, they are pushing this pro-refugee agenda.
[00:53:32.401 --> 00:53:32.801]  That's right.
[00:53:32.861 --> 00:53:37.283]  So they're trying to counter xenophobia, xenophobic attitudes in Europe.
[00:53:37.983 --> 00:53:45.546]  And he's doing more than doing this mainstream, polite push to try to normalize the refugee climate that we're in.
[00:53:45.566 --> 00:53:48.948]  He's bullying and censoring what he can't normalize in the collective psyche.
[00:53:49.148 --> 00:53:53.650]  And 600,000 in lobbying efforts and wanting to make the religion of peace.
[00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:55.030]  I don't know.
[00:54:13.496 --> 00:54:17.999]  Walking around his own hometown any longer because he knows how they feel about him.
[00:54:18.339 --> 00:54:22.061]  And throwing them off buildings and hanging them from cranes is what he cited.
[00:54:22.162 --> 00:54:28.966]  So the tolerance message only goes towards one side, unfortunately, with this massive lobbying push.
[00:54:29.286 --> 00:54:46.320]  Right, and so what about spending money to educate these people that are coming to the West, you know, here's the assimilation effort, welcome to the West, you're gonna love it here, but here's how we do things, not, hey, by the way, why don't you go ahead and beat up women who are in there sunbathing in the park in France.
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:55.728]  Exactly, so the countering the anti-migrant rhetoric and toxic narrative surrounding migration in Europe, to be exact, whatever that means.
[00:54:56.748 --> 00:55:03.393]  Well, it means threatening people with prison if they dare offend them on Facebook, like Angela Merkel has as well.
[00:55:04.093 --> 00:55:05.434]  And, you know, we see this.
[00:55:05.954 --> 00:55:08.836]  This is just kind of the name of the game here with George Soros.
[00:55:08.876 --> 00:55:14.800]  He's got his hands in everything, his group, because they are fomenting unrest because they want to destabilize the planet.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:18.542]  That's the only way they're going to be able to bring in this one world government.
[00:55:18.562 --> 00:55:23.746]  You have to destabilize, you've got to create the problem, and they're right there to provide the solution.
[00:55:24.146 --> 00:55:34.594]  I thought it was very interesting that there was an article today about some illegal immigrants that were caught there at the border and they're basically telling the Border Patrol, Obama told us to come!
[00:55:34.614 --> 00:55:35.194]  Correct!
[00:55:35.254 --> 00:55:40.798]  So we're talking about border agents that capture people illegally trying to cross the southern border.
[00:55:41.358 --> 00:55:41.759]  I think so.
[00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:00.271]  They said, look, Obama said we can come.
[00:56:00.311 --> 00:56:01.052]  It's OK.
[00:56:01.272 --> 00:56:02.353]  We've got his OK.
[00:56:02.473 --> 00:56:03.894]  They didn't say the president.
[00:56:04.014 --> 00:56:05.935]  They said specifically Obama.
[00:56:05.955 --> 00:56:06.235]  Right.
[00:56:06.315 --> 00:56:06.756]  Exactly.
[00:56:06.816 --> 00:56:09.617]  This is the message they're getting is that Obama said it's OK.
[00:56:10.798 --> 00:56:13.840]  And, you know, this is what's happening in these refugee countries as well.
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:17.683]  All they're going to do is claim political asylum and they can come right in.
[00:56:18.103 --> 00:56:21.205]  And so they don't want to go to the countries that will actually take them.
[00:56:21.265 --> 00:56:23.367]  Like I know Portugal is saying, hey, come on in.
[00:56:23.407 --> 00:56:23.947]  We'll take you.
[00:56:23.987 --> 00:56:24.888]  And they don't want to go there.
[00:56:25.168 --> 00:56:27.009]  They want to go where the handouts are.
[00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:28.370]  We have just like coming into the US.
[00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:37.636]  We have such a massive program in place, so for the refugees that the State Department has rubber-stamped in, you won't believe the benefit package.
[00:56:37.736 --> 00:56:44.200]  The visa application process is so streamlined, it's basically like, hello, you're in, oh by the way, here's a house.
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:45.561]  Here's our education.
[00:56:45.862 --> 00:56:47.283]  Here's food indefinitely.
[00:56:47.323 --> 00:56:48.625]  Have as many children as you'd like.
[00:56:48.645 --> 00:56:49.686]  We've got you.
[00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:53.570]  We know we promised that we would cure the homeless veteran population.
[00:56:54.131 --> 00:56:55.693]  That was one of Obama's pledges.
[00:56:56.113 --> 00:57:01.600]  That hasn't happened, but he's going to fast track people who are going the illegal route to come through here.
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:10.786]  Not rewarding the people who have been patiently waiting, trying to abide by the laws of coming to this country legally and going through the rigmarole of the whole visa process.
[00:57:11.266 --> 00:57:16.509]  And Ron Paul has an article up at InfoWars.com, How to Solve the Illegal Immigration Problem.
[00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:21.452]  He doesn't want walls, he doesn't want government databases, no biometric national ID cards.
[00:57:22.193 --> 00:57:22.973]  How to solve it?
[00:57:23.314 --> 00:57:26.095]  Not a penny in welfare for illegal immigrants.
[00:57:26.155 --> 00:57:27.216]  It's really that simple.
[00:57:27.476 --> 00:57:28.457]  Don't reward people.
[00:57:28.937 --> 00:57:30.398]  I mean, I love Dr. Paul.
[00:57:30.498 --> 00:57:31.858]  I agree with him on so much.
[00:57:31.878 --> 00:57:33.299]  I have such a deep respect for him.
[00:57:33.319 --> 00:57:37.240]  But in this case, Leanne, you know, he's all about small government and I am as well.
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.501]  But isn't it the job of the federal government to secure the border?
[00:57:40.521 --> 00:57:41.542]  And that's what he attacks.
[00:57:41.582 --> 00:57:46.583]  He's like, OK, well, if you build a wall eight feet high, you're going to find somebody with a ladder that's nine feet long.
[00:57:46.683 --> 00:57:48.264]  So he makes a good point.
[00:57:48.284 --> 00:57:52.906]  But at the same time, the most basic job of the federal government is to secure the border.
[00:57:53.746 --> 00:57:54.868]  Well, and that's very true.
[00:57:55.108 --> 00:58:01.617]  And as we saw in that report, with Joe Biggs as well, the wall, you know, it's more like a fence.
[00:58:01.997 --> 00:58:04.381]  It's, you know, there are barriers that are being
[00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:05.915]  I don't know.
[00:58:28.007 --> 00:58:28.947]  Family that's here.
[00:58:28.967 --> 00:58:30.268]  This one just made me so angry.
[00:58:30.308 --> 00:58:42.891]  This was a New York deli owner, and they were charged with food stamps fraud, and they actually broke in and committed a bunch of robberies, stealing kitchen cabinets, hot water tanks, and heating units from an unoccupied rental property.
[00:58:43.372 --> 00:58:47.213]  And when they get charged, she's like, F you America.
[00:58:47.293 --> 00:58:48.133]  Are you happy now?
[00:58:48.233 --> 00:58:50.314]  Now we have to pay for the crimes you committed.
[00:58:50.354 --> 00:58:50.874]  Screw you.
[00:58:52.134 --> 00:58:53.715]  Well, thank you, Margaret.
[00:58:54.155 --> 00:58:56.356]  Be sure to join us here tomorrow night, 7 p.m.
[00:58:56.416 --> 00:58:59.617]  Central, for our live coverage of the Commander-in-Chief Forum.
[00:59:04.139 --> 00:59:09.941]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.381 --> 00:59:20.105]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:38.608]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
