[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.392]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:15.401]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:17.102]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.822 --> 00:00:18.922]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:20.403]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.163 --> 00:00:22.103]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:26.345]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:31.006]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.227 --> 00:00:35.968]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:37.168]  Welcome and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:38.128 --> 00:00:40.669]  Here we are on this Tuesday already.
[00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.390]  The 15th day.
[00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:45.282]  Hard to believe.
[00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:47.764]  Of March 2016.
[00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:49.705]  The Ides of March.
[00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:56.411]  This is when Julius Caesar got stabbed to death in the Roman Forum or Roman Senate.
[00:00:58.513 --> 00:01:00.775]  We've got obviously several important guests coming on.
[00:01:00.835 --> 00:01:02.137]  I'll tell you about that after the break.
[00:01:02.197 --> 00:01:02.997]  But wow!
[00:01:03.778 --> 00:01:09.743]  To see the Washington Post on Sunday and now a string of major newspapers
[00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:23.510]  White House petitions, foreign governments, you name it, sheriff's departments calling for Trump to be disqualified and not allowed to run for president.
[00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:26.652]  Naked totalitarianism.
[00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:30.253]  I use that word a lot because that's what it is.
[00:01:30.894 --> 00:01:38.680]  Brazen, unapologetic, in your face, undeniable attempt at totalitarianism.
[00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:40.802]  I mean, look at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:43.905]  Trump hits 53 in major poll.
[00:01:44.786 --> 00:01:45.767]  Soros freaks.
[00:01:46.387 --> 00:01:47.508]  China warns.
[00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:49.430]  Japan fears.
[00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:53.506]  That's just today.
[00:01:54.366 --> 00:02:03.892]  We've got the Pope, the Chinese murdering communist government, Vicente Fox, the former president of Mexico, Rolling Stone, everybody just, you cannot have Trump.
[00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:09.575]  And he just says, hey, if China has a 20, 30, 40% tariff on us with their currency, we're not going to allow that.
[00:02:10.195 --> 00:02:14.558]  Hey, we're going to encourage and have tax incentives for companies to stay in America.
[00:02:15.658 --> 00:02:21.482]  Hey, we're going to let corporations bring their money back and lower the corporate tax rate.
[00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:34.797]  All of these things will be like untethering your boat from the dock when you're running the motor and the propeller's in the water and the boat's got its tail end out on the water trying to pull away, but you're tied to the dock.
[00:02:34.857 --> 00:02:37.419]  He wants to cut the rope.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.163]  The globalists in their own economic papers admit that with industrialization and
[00:02:43.098 --> 00:03:11.526]  mechanization and and and all the computers and robots that we should all be working 20 hours a week living like kings and basically sure to have space elevators and with those we can build huge space stations within a few years that would be completely habitable with gravity based on the centrifugal system like you see in 2001 Space Odyssey that's you know 1930s technology they already had it all basically schemed out the Saturn rocket was developed in the 30s
[00:03:13.248 --> 00:03:15.690]  On the drawing board, it's a German rocket.
[00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.893]  They can't build a Saturn rocket today with the science they have, they claim.
[00:03:21.153 --> 00:03:23.195]  Oh, and someone destroyed the blueprints.
[00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:25.817]  Yeah, right.
[00:03:25.857 --> 00:03:35.123]  They're sabotaging this level of civilization, not letting us know what's really going on and giving us Trojan horse smartphones to track and trace and run our lives.
[00:03:35.643 --> 00:03:36.484]  That's what goes on.
[00:03:39.446 --> 00:03:40.367]  So much to cover.
[00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:42.208]  They are coming after Trump.
[00:03:43.604 --> 00:03:46.425]  Soros alarm by Trump pours money into 2016 race.
[00:03:46.765 --> 00:03:48.926]  The Koch brothers pouring in money as well against him.
[00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:56.188]  Trump starts Super Tuesday, the next Super Tuesday, with a win in the Mariana Islands.
[00:03:59.049 --> 00:03:59.570]  New poll.
[00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.871]  Left-wing protesters drive people into arms of Donald Trump.
[00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:08.333]  Petition calls for the arrest and prosecution of Donald Trump at WhiteHouse.org.
[00:04:10.194 --> 00:04:10.715]  Or gov.
[00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:15.379]  Could Donald Trump be held legally responsible for inciting violence at his rallies?
[00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:16.199]  Washington Post.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.563]  Sheriff's Department considers charging Donald Trump with inciting riot.
[00:04:20.663 --> 00:04:21.784]  Infowars.com.
[00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:24.006]  Linking to WRAL.
[00:04:24.907 --> 00:04:28.410]  Thousands rush to become US citizens so they can vote against Trump.
[00:04:30.612 --> 00:04:37.598]  D'Souza says Hillary film could earn him life in prison if his last film got him eight months in the slammer.
[00:04:41.018 --> 00:04:42.039]  That's just some of what we got.
[00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:46.301]  And I want to organize across the country, at least promote, free speech rallies.
[00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.402]  Forget Trump.
[00:04:47.442 --> 00:04:50.664]  How about just free speech in America with these attempts to bully?
[00:04:51.044 --> 00:04:54.987]  Oh, and the RNC has officially said delegates not bound to primary voters.
[00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:56.127]  They intend to steal it from Trump.
[00:04:56.287 --> 00:05:04.192]  So the Chinese government, the Japanese government, Soros, the Republican Party, the Democrats, everyone, the Pope, they just say you can't have Trump.
[00:05:04.432 --> 00:05:06.614]  We should all kneel and bow and do what they say.
[00:05:08.962 --> 00:05:18.850]  A 7-Eleven shopper in Washington State relied on his concealed carry firearm over the weekend to subdue a man who attacked customers and staff with a small axe.
[00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.531]  Just before 6 a.m.
[00:05:20.592 --> 00:05:31.701]  Sunday, a masked man entered a convenience store in Seattle and began swinging a hatchet at both customers and the store clerk before attacking the cashier, reports KOMO News.
[00:05:32.421 --> 00:05:39.683]  We don't know if the intent was to commit a robbery because the suspect didn't say anything, a King County Sheriff's Sergeant said.
[00:05:40.183 --> 00:05:46.365]  An armed store patron was sitting and having coffee at the exact moment the axe-wielding suspect entered.
[00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:55.087]  The 60-year-old man, who has reportedly visited the store nearly every day for the past 12 years, shot and killed the suspect.
[00:05:55.627 --> 00:06:01.309]  The store clerk, age 58, suffered a minor injury to his stomach and is expected to recover.
[00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.825]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[00:06:08.547 --> 00:06:11.769]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:20.075]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:20.316 --> 00:06:25.339]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:16.104]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:16.184 --> 00:08:20.329]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:26.236]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:33.078 --> 00:08:36.381]  Total information, overload.
[00:08:36.721 --> 00:08:42.667]  Thank you so much for joining us on this worldwide Ides of March global transmission.
[00:08:43.528 --> 00:08:46.130]  It is Tuesday, the 15th day of March 2016.
[00:08:47.431 --> 00:08:49.353]  Another Super Tuesday, another primary.
[00:08:51.306 --> 00:08:56.068]  And Trump has already won in the Marianas Islands and is set to win in most other states.
[00:08:56.669 --> 00:09:01.631]  The Ides of March, again, is the assassination of Julius Caesar and how it changed the world.
[00:09:01.671 --> 00:09:07.674]  And it's been seen ever since then in Western culture as a very unlucky day, similar to Friday the 13th.
[00:09:08.535 --> 00:09:09.995]  Now, why do we have Friday the 13th?
[00:09:10.055 --> 00:09:20.421]  That's when the Knights Templar were taken out and exterminated in Spain and France in simultaneous hit squad directives from the Pope.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:37.288]  Some of them got word and escaped to Scotland and that's when you see the black nobility move out of France and out of Italy and to Scotland and then to London and you see the rise of the British Empire.
[00:09:37.888 --> 00:09:40.029]  Interesting little history note for folks.
[00:09:40.609 --> 00:09:41.890]  Okay, where to begin?
[00:09:46.207 --> 00:09:51.640]  Unprecedented calls to arrest Donald Trump or to silence him at whitehouse.gov.
[00:09:54.315 --> 00:09:56.377]  The Chinese government is panicking again.
[00:09:56.397 --> 00:09:57.758]  The Japanese government is panicking.
[00:09:57.778 --> 00:09:59.460]  We're going to break it down.
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.342]  There are just scores of stories out there.
[00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:17.336]  Not just SNL, not just the New York Times, but now they are putting activists on TV that try to physically attack Trump and that call for killing Trump to legitimize in the minds of easily influenced mental patients
[00:10:18.517 --> 00:10:22.739]  Out there that they should go out and try to kill Trump because they're going to be martyrs.
[00:10:23.099 --> 00:10:23.999]  They're going to be heroes.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:35.603]  If I got up on air and said as a talk show host with millions of listeners, somebody should try to go kill X. I could be sued civilly for terroristic threats.
[00:10:38.524 --> 00:10:43.846]  And I could be investigated and probably charged for a call to action.
[00:10:44.766 --> 00:10:46.127]  You have free speech.
[00:10:47.827 --> 00:10:49.188]  And I'm a total supporter of it.
[00:10:49.428 --> 00:11:02.593]  But when you try to organize people to frustrate free speech, to go out and attack rallies, and you call for people to kill someone, it has a name.
[00:11:02.753 --> 00:11:04.334]  It's called racketeering.
[00:11:06.114 --> 00:11:11.957]  And it is an organized crime practice of group intimidation, basically.
[00:11:12.677 --> 00:11:16.819]  And what we see, Soros, the Democratic Party,
[00:11:18.171 --> 00:11:29.879]  The mainstream media and the rest of them doing is organizing a giant hoax to go after Donald Trump and then that means all of our free speech.
[00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:39.185]  You see, Trump only goes up in polls as all these racist Soros funded activists and others go out and attack Trump and his supporters.
[00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:47.190]  But if we didn't have a leader who was standing up and willing to be attacked, then resistance wouldn't be victory.
[00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:47.871]  Let me explain.
[00:11:49.841 --> 00:12:07.115]  You go up and you grab, and you're sitting there with your feet touching the ground, and you go up and you grab a high-powered tension line, it is going to fry you into a crispy critter in seconds.
[00:12:07.155 --> 00:12:12.379]  Your eyes are going to pop out of your head, blood's going to spray out your ears, you're going to fry right there on the spot.
[00:12:14.946 --> 00:12:27.476]  I've gotten into transformers and things I've been working on before out at the ranch when I was a teenager, doing dangerous work like that, and you'd get into an old transformer that had blown, there'd be a fried rat inside of it, where he was the connection.
[00:12:28.257 --> 00:12:29.898]  Now you're saying, where are you going with this allegory?
[00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:34.342]  Let's think about liberty as electricity, or political movement as electricity.
[00:12:35.543 --> 00:12:43.069]  You've got massive rebellion, you've got massive resistance, you've got massive awakening against the oppression, the usurpation, the takeover.
[00:12:43.309 --> 00:12:44.350]  It's rightful revolt.
[00:12:45.632 --> 00:12:50.973]  You got someone that gets it and isn't afraid to go out and say the right things and punch the populist buttons.
[00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:54.654]  He is what is making the connection.
[00:12:54.974 --> 00:13:03.116]  The electricity is already flowing, but it can't get to the political process because the globalists have bought off the Republican and Democratic leadership.
[00:13:03.156 --> 00:13:14.358]  They control most of the states, the big institutions, the big banks, the big real estate companies, the colleges, the think tanks.
[00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:22.488]  And they create a mass wall of cognitive dissonance or what the CIA calls gaslighting.
[00:13:24.582 --> 00:13:28.543]  And it's where you basically just punch somebody in the face and then tell them, I didn't just punch you in the face.
[00:13:29.364 --> 00:13:32.005]  And if you're highly suggestible, people will actually believe it.
[00:13:32.505 --> 00:13:41.308]  And if you have other people with you, and you're authority figures, and you tell someone, no, you didn't just see that, they will start thinking they're insane and believe you.
[00:13:41.948 --> 00:13:43.668]  And they've got big studies out, you can look it up.
[00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:53.352]  Since the advent of television in the 40s, when it became more ubiquitous, by the 50s, obviously invented in the 20s, but became popular by the 40s and 50s,
[00:13:55.356 --> 00:14:20.143]  And became, again, almost at every home by the 60s, and became the center of daily life, where you don't sit around and talk to each other around the kitchen table, you sit there and you watch television, and then it becomes the arbiter, the chief of your life, the noble witch doctor, or the noble shaman, the noble chief of the tribe that tells you how to run your life.
[00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:23.864]  And since then, IQs have dropped,
[00:14:25.558 --> 00:14:26.838]  Physically, we've gotten dumber.
[00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:29.419]  The brains have been rewired.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.120]  The language has shrunk.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.861]  The life expectancy has shortened.
[00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:36.242]  The family has disintegrated.
[00:14:36.802 --> 00:14:42.324]  But more importantly, the brainwaves have lowered, look it up, to a near-sleep state while you're watching television.
[00:14:42.544 --> 00:14:49.586]  And a lot of people stay in that state after that because, on average, there's 8 hours in the United States a day of some type of screen time.
[00:14:49.987 --> 00:14:52.027]  Some people have up to 14 hours of it.
[00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:56.228]  Think about that.
[00:14:58.429 --> 00:15:01.370]  And where I'm going with this is Trump is breaking the trance.
[00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.730]  And that's why the elite are panicking.
[00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:04.891]  That's why they're saying arrest him.
[00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:05.991]  That's why they're saying kill him.
[00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:08.011]  That's why they're saying they're going to steal the election.
[00:15:08.572 --> 00:15:10.972]  Out in the open, this is such a historic moment.
[00:15:11.032 --> 00:15:12.253]  It isn't about Trump, folks.
[00:15:12.773 --> 00:15:14.473]  He was simply the conduit.
[00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:20.155]  He was simply the pigeon that landed on a
[00:15:21.872 --> 00:15:27.817]  Power pole, and accidentally touched one wire to the other, and you see a white flash and feathers shoot everywhere.
[00:15:29.778 --> 00:15:30.899]  He's the detonator.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:43.249]  How many times have you seen, I saw a hawk do it, I saw a grackle do it, and I've seen pigeons do it twice, where you, there's a flash, day or night, like a laser just, and there's feathers everywhere.
[00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:44.731]  They explode.
[00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:48.374]  One time I was walking back from swim team,
[00:15:49.952 --> 00:15:53.353]  I could walk two miles and I like to walk to swim team and then walk back.
[00:15:54.793 --> 00:16:07.116]  I was like 11 years old and there was a flash above me and then a black grackle, male grackle fell right in front of me with smoke coming off of it.
[00:16:07.336 --> 00:16:07.896]  Pretty amazing.
[00:16:09.077 --> 00:16:09.957]  But I'm digressing.
[00:16:10.477 --> 00:16:13.478]  Trump is simply allowing the connection to happen.
[00:16:13.978 --> 00:16:14.278]  Boom.
[00:16:15.362 --> 00:16:28.813]  And then notice it makes his poles go up, and it panics him, because once you breach the enemy defenses, once you actually take the fight to them, once you have resistance, that's victory, because we have history, common sense, and right on our side.
[00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:39.141]  If we don't care about being demonized, if we don't care about being attacked, if we get past our fear, we realize the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
[00:16:40.062 --> 00:16:41.583]  One of the truer things said by
[00:16:44.397 --> 00:16:45.797]  The President during World War II.
[00:16:48.978 --> 00:16:50.418]  So, look at this for yourself.
[00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:53.959]  This is so important why I'm taking so much time on this before I get to the news.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:05.942]  Trump is, here let's go to Drudge real quick, it's also up on Infowars.com, but Trump hits 53 in National Poll, Soros freaks, China warns, Japan fears.
[00:17:07.263 --> 00:17:12.564]  We've never seen foreign governments and the Pope and everybody else saying you can't have Donald Trump.
[00:17:14.653 --> 00:17:22.355]  We've never seen this behavior because he is giving vent to the anger and letting us know we have power.
[00:17:23.015 --> 00:17:24.775]  He's not a steam valve, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:26.075 --> 00:17:31.337]  He is a conduit, and that's why they've got to try to destroy him and stop him and stop this wave of awakening.
[00:17:31.537 --> 00:17:36.338]  But this wave is only going to get bigger, and Trump, again, is only a manifestation of that.
[00:17:40.199 --> 00:17:41.839]  Trump rakes 50 in national
[00:17:43.317 --> 00:17:44.517]  Support for the first time.
[00:17:44.537 --> 00:17:46.918]  We're going to break that down after the break.
[00:17:47.798 --> 00:17:50.259]  But that's what they're panicking about right now.
[00:17:50.539 --> 00:17:51.220]  So what are they doing?
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:58.082]  They're going with Nazi flags and Trump armbands to the event, doing photo ops, putting it out to their viewers.
[00:17:58.762 --> 00:18:02.823]  And people say, why would Hillary come out and say nobody died in Libya?
[00:18:03.263 --> 00:18:04.304]  When of course people did die.
[00:18:04.464 --> 00:18:04.724]  U.S.
[00:18:04.784 --> 00:18:07.845]  forces did die and hundreds of thousands of innocent people died.
[00:18:08.825 --> 00:18:11.526]  Because she knows her constituents don't know where Libya is.
[00:18:14.295 --> 00:18:16.957]  Why does she continue to come out and say things that are complete lies?
[00:18:17.878 --> 00:18:19.539]  Folks ask, what planet is she living on?
[00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:22.541]  She's living on the planet of her supporters.
[00:18:22.822 --> 00:18:24.343]  Have you seen most of her supporters?
[00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:31.568]  They are the dumbest pseudo-intellectual, uninformed, sad, desperate, scared people.
[00:18:32.749 --> 00:18:33.710]  A lot of them mean well.
[00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:39.054]  But a lot of others have been raised on the government education system.
[00:18:39.074 --> 00:18:42.236]  And I've got multiple videos at U.S.
[00:18:42.296 --> 00:18:42.837]  universities.
[00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:48.244]  With black students and Muslim students.
[00:18:49.565 --> 00:18:53.087]  This is every day now, saying we just need to kill all white people, period.
[00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:58.590]  You see, but that's not racism, that's not genocide, it's because whites are inherently bad.
[00:19:00.591 --> 00:19:06.694]  And they believe it's okay, and they're being taught by George Soros funded groups, by the Ford Foundation.
[00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:10.247]  Who want this balkanization?
[00:19:10.448 --> 00:19:11.953]  Who want us at each other's throats?
[00:19:12.495 --> 00:19:14.121]  Also up on InfoWars.com.
[00:19:16.716 --> 00:19:25.063]  Our team in Florida was able to, Richard Reeves and Josh Owens, talk to Bill Clinton, where he admits that, yeah, you know, George Soros basically really helps him out with a lot of things.
[00:19:25.363 --> 00:19:27.425]  He's basically helping Hillary's campaign right now.
[00:19:27.965 --> 00:19:34.070]  And the police are coming out in Chicago saying, yeah, it was Hillary supporters throwing things and attacking and posing as Sanders people.
[00:19:34.571 --> 00:19:38.013]  And we told you that back on Saturday, but that's confirmed now, folks.
[00:19:38.914 --> 00:19:40.415]  This is how dirty these people are.
[00:19:41.796 --> 00:19:45.900]  And they think Sanders supporters are dumb and will get into this now when Trump attacks them?
[00:19:48.366 --> 00:19:52.609]  Trump did take the bait on that, and then they'll shift from Hillary onto him attacking him.
[00:19:53.469 --> 00:19:54.330]  But Trump gets it now.
[00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.931]  He's been tweeting out that he understands it.
[00:19:56.671 --> 00:19:59.653]  But this is how sophisticated this garbage gets.
[00:19:59.773 --> 00:20:01.094]  Big broadcast today.
[00:20:01.374 --> 00:20:03.895]  I'll tell you about the guests we got coming up after this break as well.
[00:20:04.616 --> 00:20:04.996]  Stay with us.
[00:20:05.016 --> 00:20:06.657]  We're gonna give you that national poll straight ahead.
[00:20:11.946 --> 00:20:16.309]  Hey, I rode the elevator with you, but I don't work on the upper floors.
[00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:23.275]  I just want to squeeze in there right next to you, so the RFID scanner in my pocket can capture all your personal information.

[00:22:39.145 --> 00:22:42.546]  Before using Heart and Body Extract, my energy level was very, very low.
[00:22:43.007 --> 00:22:45.888]  I could only walk a few feet and then would have to sit down.
[00:22:46.248 --> 00:22:47.569]  I was tired and lethargic.
[00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:55.073]  But after taking Heart and Body Extract, my energy level has improved greatly and I can now walk longer distances without getting tired so fast.

[00:24:27.326 --> 00:24:32.027]  I'm gonna blitz a whole bunch of clips that tie together about election 2016 coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:32.767 --> 00:24:34.788]  But right now I wanted to go ahead and just get into this article.
[00:24:36.229 --> 00:24:39.772]  Trump breaks 50 in national support for the first time.
[00:24:40.332 --> 00:24:49.540]  And there are news stories out of the official newspapers in Japan, in China, in Europe, you name it.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.402]  Absolutely panicking.
[00:24:52.022 --> 00:24:53.643]  And what they're scared of is not Trump.
[00:24:53.884 --> 00:25:01.170]  They're scared of nationalism returning because the liberal, super popular mayor of London.
[00:25:02.691 --> 00:25:04.993]  Being the mayor of London is almost like being co-prime minister.
[00:25:06.072 --> 00:25:16.039]  He's now becoming libertarian and speaking out against globalism and even criticizing some political correctness and saying, yeah, we do need to vet Muslims, that they're not radical.
[00:25:17.681 --> 00:25:19.502]  He's doing that because his constituents are fed up.
[00:25:20.463 --> 00:25:25.847]  You've got all these movie stars overseas, domestically coming out and saying, I'm not liberal or conservative.
[00:25:26.687 --> 00:25:26.828]  I'm 1776.
[00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:34.352]  You got Marie Le Pen saying, we need a revolution like America had in 1776.
[00:25:35.793 --> 00:25:37.794]  We need to stop the radical Muslim invasion.
[00:25:38.255 --> 00:25:38.955]  They arrested her.
[00:25:39.435 --> 00:25:40.896]  But she's facing court next week.
[00:25:41.557 --> 00:25:42.638]  The presidential frontrunner.
[00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:44.879]  They want to shut us up.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.064]  And all they can do is bring in populations of people who are humans and who can be tribal.
[00:25:52.344 --> 00:25:53.285]  Anybody can be tribal.
[00:25:53.665 --> 00:25:56.287]  And they tell the minorities, be tribal, be racist.
[00:25:56.567 --> 00:25:57.428]  Whites are out to get you.
[00:25:58.677 --> 00:26:15.591]  The average white person is just like everybody else, working two jobs, trying to get home, trying to have dinner, trying to watch a couple TV shows, go to bed, do it all over again, go to a softball game, and you go to a softball game, you play softball, everybody, you know, white, black, Hispanic, half the people are mixed.
[00:26:16.152 --> 00:26:21.316]  What's the system going to do when, like, half the kids everywhere I go aren't white or black, they're just humans?
[00:26:22.197 --> 00:26:24.219]  Or, you know, it's ridiculous.
[00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:29.933]  And so they are just weaponizing it so nakedly.
[00:26:30.393 --> 00:26:47.008]  And then you see these swollen, when I say swollen, I don't even mean physically fat, these angry, petulant, thug-like white students, black students, you name it, going, whites are inherently bad, and we need to kill them, they need to die.
[00:26:47.028 --> 00:26:49.250]  I see that in the news every week.
[00:26:50.796 --> 00:26:56.582]  From professors, black professors that say, we need to just get rid of white people, period.
[00:27:00.386 --> 00:27:03.790]  Well, that's what racist groups of whites have said, is get rid of you.
[00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.272]  It's so stupid.
[00:27:06.854 --> 00:27:11.516]  But now they've gone into complete panic mode, showing little sign of a ceiling.
[00:27:11.837 --> 00:27:16.599]  Donald Trump has only grown in support with the exit of Ben Carson and Marco Rubio's collapse.
[00:27:17.139 --> 00:27:25.924]  In the last two weeks, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has won more delegates in primary caucuses, even while his opponents have launched new attacks and questions have been raised about his supporters.
[00:27:26.204 --> 00:27:32.027]  This week's Economist YouGov poll finds Trump still the top GOP voters
[00:27:32.927 --> 00:27:41.252]  Preference with a wider lead than ever, but Florida Senator Marco Rubio seems most damaged by two weeks of attacks and counterattacks.
[00:27:42.272 --> 00:27:46.494]  And then it goes through the numbers, but he's breaking 50 nationally.
[00:27:46.795 --> 00:27:48.856]  Unprecedented, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:49.256 --> 00:27:50.437]  Rubio is sagging.
[00:27:51.617 --> 00:27:54.679]  Kasich has gone up a tiny bit, but I mean he's already so low it doesn't matter.
[00:27:54.699 --> 00:27:57.541]  It's like a snail crawling over a grain of sand.
[00:27:57.961 --> 00:28:00.042]  And then you got Ted Cruz there being propped up.
[00:28:01.277 --> 00:28:05.654]  And I tell you, all these purist Republicans out there are not sophisticated enough.
[00:28:06.857 --> 00:28:10.139]  To understand that Ted Cruz is a sleeper operative.
[00:28:10.399 --> 00:28:12.581]  There's no doubt the Bushes are behind him.
[00:28:13.401 --> 00:28:16.263]  There's no doubt he's even doing Obama pauses now.
[00:28:16.663 --> 00:28:21.206]  There's no doubt his wife was at Goldman Sachs CFR running key trade deals.
[00:28:21.686 --> 00:28:29.471]  There is no doubt that as a strict constructionist he can't be president because his father wasn't born here and he was born in another country.
[00:28:29.812 --> 00:28:30.652]  Sorry, just can't do it.
[00:28:33.203 --> 00:28:40.948]  When he was a senator, battling and doing some good things, and championing against Obamacare, and for the Second Amendment, I support his votes and what he did.
[00:28:42.089 --> 00:28:44.411]  But let me tell you, he is uncloaking at the key moment.
[00:28:46.332 --> 00:28:47.413]  Now, do I trust Trump?
[00:28:48.894 --> 00:28:51.315]  I trust him to be his own person, and that's why they hate him.
[00:28:51.455 --> 00:28:53.377]  Again, he could be a disaster.
[00:28:53.637 --> 00:28:54.778]  It doesn't matter.
[00:28:55.138 --> 00:29:00.001]  It's the will of the people, the whole elite are angry, they're panicking.
[00:29:01.502 --> 00:29:02.163]  And I know this,
[00:29:04.485 --> 00:29:08.427]  We can directly tweet at Trump and say, you're wrong.
[00:29:08.547 --> 00:29:10.348]  It's Hillary setting up Sanders.
[00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:16.030]  So the Sanders people turn against you in the general election instead of Hillary.
[00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.011]  And then Trump comes out and gets it.
[00:29:21.684 --> 00:29:26.687]  I have seen him get it over and over and over again where he says, well these are Christians being murdered.
[00:29:27.048 --> 00:29:28.669]  Of course we gotta bring in the refugees.
[00:29:29.229 --> 00:29:31.631]  You know, Obama launched these attacks with ISIS, we have to do it.
[00:29:31.851 --> 00:29:34.152]  Then he goes, wait, they're radical jihadis that aren't being vetted?
[00:29:34.813 --> 00:29:35.893]  They don't even check their IDs?
[00:29:35.913 --> 00:29:36.914]  We gotta stop all that!
[00:29:38.075 --> 00:29:44.439]  He does it flip-flop, other than going from bad positions to getting more info and changing.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.061]  And he always changes to the good.
[00:29:50.237 --> 00:29:51.118]  That's what I see here.
[00:29:51.158 --> 00:29:52.500]  He's learning on the job.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.002]  That's why they're so scared.
[00:29:54.242 --> 00:29:55.784]  He's influenced by common sense.
[00:29:56.204 --> 00:29:56.685]  We'll be back.
[00:29:56.705 --> 00:29:57.125]  Stay with us.
[00:29:58.046 --> 00:29:58.947]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.448 --> 00:30:01.050]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.971 --> 00:30:04.654]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:08.746 --> 00:30:14.093]  In a rather bizarre statement, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has said that the U.S.
[00:30:14.133 --> 00:30:22.565]  didn't lose a single person in Libya, which is to say the former Secretary of State is ignoring the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
[00:30:23.626 --> 00:30:24.987]  Libya is perfect, isn't it?
[00:30:25.128 --> 00:30:25.788]  Clinton said.
[00:30:26.189 --> 00:30:28.371]  Libya was a different kind of calculation.
[00:30:28.771 --> 00:30:30.353]  And we didn't lose a single person.
[00:30:30.613 --> 00:30:35.558]  We didn't have a problem in supporting our European and Arab allies in working with NATO.
[00:30:35.838 --> 00:30:39.041]  Mrs. Clinton conveniently skipped over the attack of September 11, 2012.
[00:30:40.723 --> 00:30:44.605]  On the diplomatic special mission compound and CIA annex in Benghazi.
[00:30:44.826 --> 00:30:53.131]  The left ambassador Christopher Stevens, foreign management officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Smith and Glenn Doherty dead.
[00:30:53.331 --> 00:30:55.972]  There's even a movie out about it called 13 Hours.
[00:30:56.413 --> 00:31:01.476]  And this isn't the first time Hillary has had a selective memory, but what difference does it make?
[00:31:01.736 --> 00:31:05.298]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[00:32:12.967 --> 00:32:17.593]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:32:17.733 --> 00:32:18.754]  Talk about the effects.
[00:32:19.074 --> 00:32:20.556]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:32:20.576 --> 00:32:22.198]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:32:22.498 --> 00:32:23.560]  I feel like I look better.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.281]  I feel better.
[00:32:24.341 --> 00:32:25.362]  I feel sexier.
[00:32:25.382 --> 00:32:26.123]  I love it.
[00:32:26.363 --> 00:32:29.267]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:32.030]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.291]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:32:33.331 --> 00:32:34.372]  Consult your physician.

[00:32:36.894 --> 00:32:37.834]  This is life changing.

[00:32:59.531 --> 00:33:00.832]  Hillary has no excitement.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.882]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.123 --> 00:33:27.424]  The system knows who's real, who's maverick, and who isn't.
[00:33:28.144 --> 00:33:34.588]  They're even getting ready to hold their nose and support Ted Cruz at the convention over Trump.
[00:33:34.708 --> 00:33:35.808]  That's how much they hate him.
[00:33:36.368 --> 00:33:37.969]  And they don't like Cruz either.
[00:33:38.129 --> 00:33:40.510]  I mean, I don't think Cruz overall is a really bad guy.
[00:33:41.691 --> 00:33:45.633]  But the Bushes know they can't win on the Bush family name anymore.
[00:33:45.913 --> 00:33:46.613]  They just can't do it.
[00:33:47.113 --> 00:33:47.894]  The name is mud.
[00:33:49.508 --> 00:33:51.792]  I feel sorry for folks that have that great German name.
[00:33:51.812 --> 00:33:54.155]  I know people that have the Bush last name that are very nice people.
[00:33:58.996 --> 00:33:59.637]  It's ridiculous.
[00:33:59.657 --> 00:34:05.242]  There's a video up on DrudgeReport.com that's shot by Josh Owens in the American Mirror.
[00:34:05.802 --> 00:34:14.070]  I love the fact that our articles and our videos are, again, all over the place every day with other journalists understanding how important they are.
[00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:23.539]  And I love actually seeing our stuff on Drudge through other people's work, through other people's sites, because that's what I want to do is defeat the globalists, not get a bunch of credit for InfoWars.
[00:34:24.633 --> 00:34:32.195]  But look, the American Mirror video, Hillary Stafford struggles to fire up unenthusiastic fans.
[00:34:32.215 --> 00:34:33.955]  We're going to play the video later, it's so pathetic.
[00:34:34.335 --> 00:34:37.376]  It's like, yay, come on, get excited, come on everybody!
[00:34:37.676 --> 00:34:44.498]  And it looks like maybe, maybe 50, 60 people waiting to hear Hillary speak.
[00:34:45.595 --> 00:34:52.263]  She's had crowds in San Antonio of maybe 500, in Austin of maybe 300, 400, in Dallas.
[00:34:52.463 --> 00:34:55.026]  But I look at liberal cities, maybe a couple thousand.
[00:34:56.307 --> 00:34:56.988]  Bernie Sanders, 30, 40, 50,000.
[00:34:58.489 --> 00:35:04.556]  They lied and said he had 100,000 out at the airport, the news did, and out at the racetrack.
[00:35:04.676 --> 00:35:04.977]  I was like 10,000.
[00:35:06.704 --> 00:35:09.626]  So sometimes I have to correct myself because I go off mainstream media and it's not true.
[00:35:09.646 --> 00:35:13.148]  But the point is, he's got much bigger crowds than she does.
[00:35:13.208 --> 00:35:14.668]  She's stealing all these states.
[00:35:15.309 --> 00:35:22.853]  But at a certain point it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where she's winning so people just go ahead and vote for her even though they weren't supporting her before.
[00:35:23.613 --> 00:35:27.596]  So now she wants to get the Bernie people to go after Trump.
[00:35:27.936 --> 00:35:29.977]  And that's why they're sending operatives out.
[00:35:30.957 --> 00:35:31.758]  Soros funded.
[00:35:32.098 --> 00:35:33.399]  That's how dumb they think we are.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:56.853]  If Soros admits and Hillary admits that they're funding these groups, but then they still have Bernie blamed for it and their constituents buy it because they are the most uninformed, cult-like, groupthink package of so-called politicos I've ever seen.
[00:35:58.837 --> 00:36:04.601]  Now, before I go any further on this front, I wanted to start going through some of these videos.
[00:36:05.181 --> 00:36:12.005]  And then I'm going to break down the specifics of the calls to arrest Trump.
[00:36:12.445 --> 00:36:18.549]  They have sheriff's departments calling for it, The Washington Post calling for it, White House petitions calling for it.
[00:36:18.889 --> 00:36:27.615]  They're really beating this drum so that when they assassinate him, God forbid, or when they hype somebody up to have an attempt on his life,
[00:36:29.417 --> 00:36:30.237]  Well, he deserves it.
[00:36:30.277 --> 00:36:30.898]  It's his rhetoric.
[00:36:32.018 --> 00:36:33.879]  Think of this unprecedented time.
[00:36:35.279 --> 00:36:35.759]  Think about it.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.322]  We deserve to have sovereignty and we deserve to not just let people come in and get free stuff.
[00:36:41.702 --> 00:36:42.282]  Oh my gosh.
[00:36:42.962 --> 00:36:44.323]  We're going to abolish Obamacare.
[00:36:44.403 --> 00:36:44.963]  Oh my gosh.
[00:36:45.283 --> 00:36:46.744]  We're going to have fair trade deals.
[00:36:47.444 --> 00:36:48.244]  I love free trade.
[00:36:48.304 --> 00:36:49.065]  I love free trade.
[00:36:49.105 --> 00:36:49.505]  Believe me.
[00:36:49.725 --> 00:36:51.065]  But we're not going to have these one-sided trade deals.
[00:36:51.286 --> 00:36:52.246]  That's what they are!
[00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:54.487]  They go, oh, watch out.
[00:36:54.707 --> 00:36:56.408]  Protectionism caused the Great Depression.
[00:36:56.688 --> 00:36:57.248]  No, it didn't.
[00:36:58.783 --> 00:36:59.783]  Go read the history books.
[00:36:59.823 --> 00:37:05.604]  It wasn't smooth hauling and that stuff came in during the crash, right as it was happening.
[00:37:07.365 --> 00:37:07.965]  Ridiculous!
[00:37:09.125 --> 00:37:10.786]  And I'm not for a bunch of protectionism.
[00:37:11.546 --> 00:37:16.547]  Except when countries are using slave labor and they have no environmental regulations.
[00:37:18.567 --> 00:37:20.268]  The factories are owned by Chinese generals.
[00:37:21.248 --> 00:37:22.248]  They don't pay taxes.
[00:37:23.088 --> 00:37:24.148]  No one can compete with it.
[00:37:26.589 --> 00:37:27.109]  It's incredible.
[00:37:28.803 --> 00:37:29.744]  You have to deal with that.
[00:37:30.064 --> 00:37:33.087]  Hillary came out and said, hey, coal mining's going fine.
[00:37:33.147 --> 00:37:34.348]  Hey, nobody died in Libya.
[00:37:34.368 --> 00:37:34.648]  Hey.
[00:37:35.529 --> 00:37:39.713]  When Obama's on tape saying, if you have a coal power plant, we're going to bankrupt you.
[00:37:39.753 --> 00:37:40.514]  That's a close quote.
[00:37:41.515 --> 00:37:43.016]  We will bankrupt you.
[00:37:43.376 --> 00:37:52.345]  That is the president of the United States, right before he got elected in 2008, saying you can have a plant, but we will bankrupt you.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.020]  And the average trendy goes good.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.921]  The reason I hype on coal, I own no coal, no stocks, no nothing.
[00:38:01.381 --> 00:38:02.982]  It's because I want prosperity.
[00:38:03.322 --> 00:38:07.103]  And I know the power bills in this country have almost doubled the last eight years for good reason.
[00:38:08.003 --> 00:38:14.864]  They've shut down over a thousand coal power plants, modern clean systems that put out nothing into the atmosphere.
[00:38:15.304 --> 00:38:19.365]  They produce distillates that are used in steel and other alloy production.
[00:38:22.595 --> 00:38:24.836]  And it's just an amazing science.
[00:38:24.856 --> 00:38:27.517]  We have enough coal for a thousand plus years at current rates.
[00:38:28.878 --> 00:38:31.719]  And that's why the economy's dead.
[00:38:32.359 --> 00:38:33.380]  Let me explain this.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.300]  I'll explain this very, very slowly to all the trendies.
[00:38:35.721 --> 00:38:37.741]  I know you tune in and the show's like a big joke to you.
[00:38:39.142 --> 00:38:45.785]  Do you understand that just eight years ago, about 65% of our power came from coal?
[00:38:47.065 --> 00:38:47.706]  Now it's more like 40%.
[00:38:49.813 --> 00:38:52.295]  And you're paying almost double for that power.
[00:38:53.035 --> 00:38:54.036]  They didn't replace it.
[00:38:56.638 --> 00:38:57.338]  You understand that?
[00:39:01.381 --> 00:39:05.684]  So this whole carbon tax thing is about shutting off the cheapest form of power.
[00:39:06.985 --> 00:39:16.932]  And that's why the oil companies, if you actually do the research, the big ones, Dutch Rochelle, BP, ExxonMobil and others, have been financing
[00:39:18.427 --> 00:39:22.068]  Research and movements and lobbying to have coal completely shut off.
[00:39:23.968 --> 00:39:28.649]  Because the oil companies also own a lot of natural gas, which they can then replace the plants with.
[00:39:29.029 --> 00:39:29.830]  It's more expensive.
[00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:32.870]  And by the way, my family has gas wells.
[00:39:33.491 --> 00:39:41.572]  So if I wanted to just think about me, that's how the average scumbag thinks, I would go, oh yeah, get rid of coal, because I might get some money if natural gas ever goes back up.
[00:39:42.193 --> 00:39:43.633]  I've never gotten money from natural gas.
[00:39:45.441 --> 00:39:48.003]  My mom's mom, a little bit.
[00:39:48.243 --> 00:39:49.044]  My dad, a little bit.
[00:39:49.084 --> 00:39:50.345]  I mean, there's so many of them.
[00:39:50.385 --> 00:39:51.866]  You don't really get that much money.
[00:39:52.186 --> 00:39:54.228]  But I guess if gas ever exploded in price, you would.
[00:39:54.748 --> 00:39:57.871]  But I just, the average person I'll talk to them and go, I don't care about this.
[00:39:58.251 --> 00:39:59.212]  I'm invested in this.
[00:39:59.292 --> 00:40:06.418]  As if you screw over some industry, you take a resource, and then that makes your industry rise when everything else sinks.
[00:40:06.878 --> 00:40:09.300]  That's not free market.
[00:40:10.261 --> 00:40:12.863]  It's a scam and it makes me fundamentally get angry.
[00:40:14.949 --> 00:40:28.314]  I've run into so many people that are petroleum geologists, and so many leasehounds, and so many people that are involved in exploration of oil and gas, and had family that were petroleum geologists, and family that's run, you know, run refineries, major refineries.
[00:40:29.074 --> 00:40:31.595]  My dad's uncle, he's dead now, ran one of the biggest refineries in Houston.
[00:40:33.275 --> 00:40:34.576]  Was a plant manager for 30 years.
[00:40:37.017 --> 00:40:43.459]  And I've just sat around and talked to them, and they go, oh, everybody knows that, sure, yeah.
[00:40:44.249 --> 00:40:48.011]  Yeah, I've been to the board meetings when they take out natural gas.
[00:40:49.592 --> 00:40:52.614]  And when they take out coal, natural gas will then be moved.
[00:40:52.634 --> 00:40:53.534]  We're lobbying for that.
[00:40:53.614 --> 00:40:56.436]  And then oil's also financing it.
[00:40:56.476 --> 00:41:00.538]  I mean, it's just a fact in these oil company level discussions.
[00:41:02.479 --> 00:41:04.120]  And it's so frustrating.
[00:41:05.701 --> 00:41:08.042]  But let me finish the part of the equation and I'm going to quit ranting.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:15.446]  China builds multiple coal power plants that have no scrubbers and spew poison in the air.
[00:41:18.048 --> 00:41:23.953]  And then we shut down multiple plants per week while they open multiple per week.
[00:41:24.354 --> 00:41:29.338]  You cannot compete with energy that is basically a third the price of ours.
[00:41:30.139 --> 00:41:31.921]  Factories have to go there.
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:39.964]  Mexico has built over 50 coal power plants just in the Maquiladores in the last six, seven years.
[00:41:40.324 --> 00:41:40.664]  And it's U.S.
[00:41:41.005 --> 00:41:49.409]  and multinational coal companies move, in some cases, one mile over the border, build a coal power plant, and the factory moves there.
[00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.431]  And why does the American factory move there?
[00:41:54.192 --> 00:41:56.413]  Because you have to.
[00:41:57.474 --> 00:42:02.277]  Or your electricity bill is two to three to four times more.
[00:42:03.874 --> 00:42:04.575]  In many cases.
[00:42:06.736 --> 00:42:10.319]  Texas had some of the cheapest electricity in the nation because we had so many coal power plants.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.580]  It's not the case anymore.
[00:42:11.821 --> 00:42:14.103]  It wasn't just no income tax, state income tax.
[00:42:14.343 --> 00:42:15.424]  It wasn't just things like that.
[00:42:15.624 --> 00:42:17.025]  It was that we had the cheapest power.
[00:42:17.385 --> 00:42:20.488]  Texas was supplying the surrounding four states with their power.
[00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:24.791]  Austin owned four power plants.
[00:42:24.811 --> 00:42:28.695]  A couple of them were multi-billion dollar plants.
[00:42:28.735 --> 00:42:29.595]  You know what Austin did?
[00:42:31.397 --> 00:42:32.358]  They divested
[00:42:34.019 --> 00:42:38.481]  And in one case, wouldn't even let anyone buy them out and turn the plant back on.
[00:42:39.242 --> 00:42:40.402]  They just shut it off.
[00:42:44.004 --> 00:42:44.625]  Let me explain that.
[00:42:45.045 --> 00:42:53.269]  Austin didn't want the close to a billion dollars they could have sold, what was it, their Fayetteville plant.
[00:42:55.451 --> 00:42:59.032]  They just scuttled that part of the plant.
[00:42:59.052 --> 00:42:59.793]  It's got three plants.
[00:43:00.513 --> 00:43:01.714]  Look it up for yourself, I'm going from memory.
[00:43:03.396 --> 00:43:05.197]  Again, get your mind around that.
[00:43:05.897 --> 00:43:07.418]  Get your mind around that.
[00:43:09.839 --> 00:43:11.839]  For a nation to operate, it's gotta have power.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.762]  Our government is unplugging us from the power cord.
[00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:22.704]  Oh, they really want us to be wealthy and have prosperity, and Hillary's gonna give you that.
[00:43:25.605 --> 00:43:26.285]  Let's go to the clips.
[00:43:28.726 --> 00:43:31.948]  Let's go ahead and start with
[00:43:33.692 --> 00:43:36.294]  Black students advocate white genocide at Harvard.
[00:43:36.935 --> 00:43:45.342]  Now remember, at Harvard, and at Yale, and at a bunch of other universities, they're getting rid of the word master.
[00:43:46.644 --> 00:43:51.128]  A master painter, a master fencer, a master at jiu-jitsu.
[00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:56.773]  They're getting rid of the word lynch on buildings.
[00:43:58.015 --> 00:43:59.917]  They're banning costume parties.
[00:43:59.977 --> 00:44:05.522]  And if a professor says, we need free speech, that's true liberalism, they scream at them and then they're fired.
[00:44:06.783 --> 00:44:08.966]  You ask, why would the elite want this all over the world?
[00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:10.587]  They want to end free speech.
[00:44:10.647 --> 00:44:15.992]  And these are cults they're creating of absolute racial divide who they will then deploy
[00:44:16.852 --> 00:44:23.578]  With basically PhDs they're given to go run your city and your town and make it all about race and have us all at each other's throats.
[00:44:23.698 --> 00:44:25.380]  It is a military program.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:42.996]  To have brainwashed, idiot, racist, getting a degree in black Ku Klux Klan behavior, and Mecha and La Raza Hispanic Ku Klux Klan behavior, all Soros Ford Foundation funded, with black professors, not just students, saying, we should kill all whites.
[00:44:43.959 --> 00:44:45.600]  This is funded by the elite.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:46.861]  And let me give you a newsflash.
[00:44:47.621 --> 00:44:49.102]  You're not going to get to kill all the whites.
[00:44:49.703 --> 00:45:01.210]  This is meant to make whites then racist, set up a prison-style economy, and so whites under desperation will join with the state in the overall actual oppression of everybody.
[00:45:02.671 --> 00:45:03.912]  It's a divide and conquer strategy.
[00:45:05.232 --> 00:45:07.074]  The opposite of what Martin Luther King talked about.
[00:45:07.094 --> 00:45:08.054]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[00:45:09.995 --> 00:45:12.197]  Why do white people have a right to affirm their life?
[00:45:13.935 --> 00:45:15.516]  Because all whites have value.
[00:45:16.737 --> 00:45:17.137]  Really?
[00:45:18.138 --> 00:45:18.558]  How so?
[00:45:18.578 --> 00:45:22.861]  Why does white life have value?
[00:45:22.941 --> 00:45:23.242]  For who?
[00:45:23.742 --> 00:45:25.283]  Our argument is that white life is wrong.
[00:45:25.703 --> 00:45:25.943]  Why?
[00:45:26.804 --> 00:45:30.126]  Our argument is that we should never affirm white life.
[00:45:30.226 --> 00:45:34.209]  That your argument just affirming all life in general is not good.
[00:45:34.289 --> 00:45:38.352]  Especially not good for black people when white life itself is based off of black's ability to live white life.
[00:45:39.594 --> 00:45:40.714]  You're probably white.
[00:45:41.174 --> 00:45:41.654]  I am white.
[00:45:41.714 --> 00:45:42.655]  Why should nobody affirm my white?
[00:45:42.955 --> 00:45:45.275]  Honestly, I don't have to care about your life anyway.
[00:45:45.295 --> 00:45:48.656]  There's no ethical reason as to why white people deserve to live.
[00:45:48.696 --> 00:45:51.256]  Affirming black life means that meaning that white death has to occur.
[00:45:51.276 --> 00:45:53.177]  That's why you should lose this ban.
[00:45:53.197 --> 00:45:54.557]  Why your life ain't worth affirming.
[00:45:54.577 --> 00:45:56.857]  Should I kill myself, like, under your argument?
[00:45:57.257 --> 00:45:57.477]  Sure.
[00:45:58.078 --> 00:45:58.378]  Okay.
[00:45:58.798 --> 00:46:00.678]  Uh, so, should we kill himself?
[00:46:00.698 --> 00:46:01.818]  I don't see why not.
[00:46:02.358 --> 00:46:03.919]  Uh, why, why should we do that?
[00:46:03.999 --> 00:46:04.579]  How does that help?
[00:46:04.599 --> 00:46:04.999]  It's ethical.
[00:46:05.626 --> 00:46:05.966]  Alright.
[00:46:06.387 --> 00:46:07.187]  Arrogant, racist,
[00:46:34.989 --> 00:46:37.891]  So-called black guys, they look like they're about 80% Caucasian.
[00:46:40.093 --> 00:46:44.057]  Entitled, feeling like they're royal because they're the oppressed.
[00:46:45.318 --> 00:46:47.199]  That's how this victimology works.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.901]  It's like stars on your shoulder.
[00:46:50.622 --> 00:46:51.523]  Like you're a general.
[00:46:51.883 --> 00:46:55.566]  The more you've been abused, the more you've heard somebody did something bad to you.
[00:46:56.547 --> 00:47:00.690]  And you've got these bozo-looking white college students.
[00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:02.552]  And I'm not knocking them, but that's white people.
[00:47:03.442 --> 00:47:05.323]  Probably wanna go play video games, watch football.
[00:47:06.104 --> 00:47:08.346]  They're just like, hey, I'm white, I don't wanna do anything wrong.
[00:47:08.366 --> 00:47:09.847]  I think all lives matter.
[00:47:09.867 --> 00:47:11.288]  It's like, yeah, go kill yourself.
[00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:12.809]  Whites just seem to die, all of ya.
[00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:15.611]  And that's the attitude.
[00:47:18.354 --> 00:47:21.616]  I mean, imagine if the Klan was saying, kill all the black people, it'd be, oh, how horrible.
[00:47:22.717 --> 00:47:28.441]  And that's what you pay to send your kids to public school, most of the private schools, and to secondary education now.
[00:47:29.722 --> 00:47:31.204]  Most of it is learning.
[00:47:32.401 --> 00:47:33.761]  How to be a social justice warrior.
[00:47:34.522 --> 00:47:42.464]  And then they get the first year freshman in to the sensitivity training courses, you gotta go to now in most colleges, and you're bullied and you're beat down.
[00:47:42.984 --> 00:47:47.265]  And then after that happens, you're taken to a party, about two, three months into it.
[00:47:49.146 --> 00:47:51.066]  And it's like, oh, you're all right now.
[00:47:51.606 --> 00:47:54.267]  And they'll have PhD students there that are all controlling it.
[00:47:54.547 --> 00:47:55.708]  It's cult induction.
[00:47:56.188 --> 00:47:58.828]  And then if you just accept it, then it's all right.
[00:47:58.888 --> 00:48:00.069]  Now everybody's gonna be nice to you.
[00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.769]  You can go to college.
[00:48:01.954 --> 00:48:09.699]  And that's what it came out as happening at Mizzou, and it's now being reported, Mizzou may pay price for campus protest as enrollment plunges.
[00:48:09.719 --> 00:48:15.363]  Remember the famous white professor lady coming over and saying, get me some muscle, take these people out, beat them up.
[00:48:16.905 --> 00:48:23.549]  Safe spaces may become empty spaces at the University of Missouri, where officials acknowledged an expected sharp decline, upwards of 25%.
[00:48:26.618 --> 00:48:35.363]  And when they questioned folks, they said, look, we don't want to go to college for social justice training and sensitivity training and to learn how bad we are.
[00:48:39.765 --> 00:48:41.606]  We just want to live our lives.
[00:48:43.307 --> 00:48:51.412]  And so people are also seeing enrollment go way down around the country because most of these college degrees are near worthless.
[00:48:52.426 --> 00:48:55.449]  Going and working in the field you want to be in is the way to go.
[00:48:55.469 --> 00:49:01.375]  Now obviously you have to go through rites of passage if you want to be a lawyer, or if you want to be a doctor, or if you want to be an engineer.
[00:49:01.415 --> 00:49:03.157]  You can certainly learn things in those disciplines.
[00:49:03.537 --> 00:49:06.540]  But really you're just meeting the right people and learning how to be charming.
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:14.188]  So many young people out of college, they think acting arrogant, distant, empowered, but you're bad,
[00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:20.412]  They think, because I mean, I run into this all over, you see it everywhere.
[00:49:20.833 --> 00:49:28.757]  They think acting arrogant, like in junior high, that got them ahead, because you must be cool, is what gets you ahead in business and life.
[00:49:29.058 --> 00:49:38.823]  No, knowing what you're doing, showing up on time, working really hard, and most important, being charming, playing golf with the boss, going to the Christmas party.
[00:49:40.264 --> 00:49:44.367]  Because if you're charming there, you're going to be charming in sales, you're going to be charming in everything else.
[00:49:47.659 --> 00:49:48.419]  I got another clip.
[00:49:48.759 --> 00:49:52.561]  It's in Turkish, but it ties to this.
[00:49:52.601 --> 00:49:55.022]  Turkish Muslims want to kill non-believers.
[00:49:57.183 --> 00:50:00.064]  I shall stab them one by one whenever I find them, catch them and kill them.
[00:50:00.484 --> 00:50:02.305]  They don't believe in Allah or the Quran.
[00:50:02.685 --> 00:50:03.746]  They are unbelievers and animals.
[00:50:03.766 --> 00:50:04.346]  They are not human.
[00:50:04.366 --> 00:50:05.386]  They are not human.
[00:50:05.687 --> 00:50:06.467]  They are not like us.
[00:50:06.847 --> 00:50:07.667]  God bleeping them.
[00:50:07.887 --> 00:50:08.788]  They don't believe in Allah.
[00:50:09.068 --> 00:50:09.488]  To hell with them.
[00:50:09.508 --> 00:50:10.949]  This is, of course, the folks that are coming into Europe.
[00:50:11.189 --> 00:50:12.930]  This is what the left particularly wants.
[00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:13.850]  We're going to skip this break.
[00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:15.891]  Because then you can
[00:50:17.304 --> 00:50:23.168]  Bully everyone to tell them to submit to this.
[00:50:23.768 --> 00:50:25.129]  You've been taught to be politically correct.
[00:50:25.189 --> 00:50:26.350]  You have no immune system.
[00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:27.971]  You have no cultural resistance.
[00:50:28.331 --> 00:50:36.497]  And so here come third world hardcore folks that are constantly killing each other and they're gonna muscle, they're gonna run you down.
[00:50:37.961 --> 00:50:50.677]  And, and, and, and men in the West, I don't care if you're Japanese or you're, you're American, you're Hispanic or whatever, Americanized, you know, Westernized, uh, metrosexual men, women think those are cute and those are their buddies, that's not who they're looking for.
[00:50:52.139 --> 00:50:54.322]  And so these guys just run right over and get your daughter.
[00:50:55.333 --> 00:51:01.819]  They just run right up and just grab them when they're 16 or they're 14 or 15 and there'll be no statutory rape charges for them.
[00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:05.222]  In Germany, they're allowed to have sex with five-year-olds if you're a Muslim.
[00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:10.866]  They just, the police have said, it's your culture, you're, and by the way, you want to rape somebody's 10-year-old in Sweden?
[00:51:11.087 --> 00:51:11.487]  Do it!
[00:51:12.308 --> 00:51:13.349]  They're white, they deserve it!
[00:51:13.389 --> 00:51:19.914]  And so you get the big imam of Jerusalem gets up and says, we are coming to Germany, your women are ours!
[00:51:22.884 --> 00:51:24.404]  Because nobody stands up.
[00:51:24.885 --> 00:51:28.366]  Only we do nothing but roll over and run up white flags.
[00:51:29.826 --> 00:51:39.629]  And of course, these arrogant people who could never take us down before, who feared the West, now are on these power trips because they know we're weak.
[00:51:39.669 --> 00:51:40.649]  They know we're pathetic.
[00:51:40.689 --> 00:51:41.770]  They know we're servile.
[00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:43.890]  They know we want to fall.
[00:51:46.311 --> 00:51:50.012]  And just the arrogant, slimy, seedy dirtiness of it all.
[00:51:51.733 --> 00:51:52.453]  I mean, let me tell you.
[00:51:53.951 --> 00:51:57.672]  There are sectors in the Middle East where they treat women well, and a lot of culture and science came out.
[00:51:58.232 --> 00:52:06.235]  But let me tell you, with the slave trade, and the spice trade, and human trafficking, slavery never got brought to the levels it did in the Middle East.
[00:52:07.035 --> 00:52:13.877]  That's why we're always lectured by the Imams and folks about the West and slavery, because they're the King Daddies of it!
[00:52:14.357 --> 00:52:15.277]  Everything's inverted!
[00:52:17.758 --> 00:52:19.979]  You want women chained up and sex slaves?
[00:52:22.523 --> 00:52:25.004]  You want male slaves with their genitals cut off?
[00:52:25.124 --> 00:52:27.104]  You want hundreds of millions killed?
[00:52:27.665 --> 00:52:28.205]  Baby!
[00:52:28.225 --> 00:52:31.746]  The Wahambi's know how to deliver it.
[00:52:34.087 --> 00:52:38.708]  And they have no respect for you because, quite frankly, I don't deserve respect.
[00:52:38.768 --> 00:52:40.068]  America doesn't deserve respect.
[00:52:40.308 --> 00:52:42.189]  We have to admit how pathetic we are.
[00:52:42.389 --> 00:52:48.971]  You know, when I go out to a man on the street, a person on the street, so you see the political correctness?
[00:52:48.991 --> 00:52:49.811]  Don't follow any of it anymore.
[00:52:49.831 --> 00:52:51.692]  When I go out to a man on the street,
[00:52:55.086 --> 00:52:59.290]  When we go out there to talk to people, we don't do it to make fun of them and put them down.
[00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:03.314]  You think I like, the other night, I did a Facebook mentions, Buckley and Lien are like, stop it, you know.
[00:53:03.654 --> 00:53:04.976]  You're making them feel bad, it's embarrassing.
[00:53:05.036 --> 00:53:06.397]  It's meant to be embarrassing.
[00:53:08.259 --> 00:53:11.122]  I'm not out there making fun of people because I like it.
[00:53:11.302 --> 00:53:15.846]  You think I like getting in front of a thousand people and telling them how stupid they are and how pathetic they are?
[00:53:15.866 --> 00:53:19.310]  One of them can take offense, I don't care.
[00:53:20.816 --> 00:53:24.280]  They're being used by Google telling them they love them and they care about them.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.623]  The whole South by Southwest thing is a fraud on record.
[00:53:27.903 --> 00:53:28.924]  I know the founder of it.
[00:53:29.949 --> 00:53:33.872]  It's where you pay thousands of dollars to go have corporate garbage spewed onto you.
[00:53:34.072 --> 00:53:38.155]  It's the biggest joke and hoax in marketing I've ever seen.
[00:53:39.175 --> 00:53:44.479]  They told us two years ago we couldn't hand out pamphlets in downtown and ordered two different groups of police to do it.
[00:53:44.639 --> 00:53:46.961]  Then they had code enforcers come over and I said, go ahead.
[00:53:47.221 --> 00:53:47.941]  I know the code.
[00:53:48.161 --> 00:53:48.942]  You're going to get sued.
[00:53:49.282 --> 00:53:50.043]  And they had to back off.
[00:53:50.323 --> 00:53:55.566]  But they don't let people 20 miles from Austin have a rock concert during it.
[00:53:55.727 --> 00:53:59.069]  They show up like gangsters and say, you better watch it.
[00:54:02.383 --> 00:54:04.385]  They charge $80 parking during it.
[00:54:05.266 --> 00:54:11.591]  It's a joke with all these people thinking they're coming there to find out the secret of how to be successful, just like college.
[00:54:12.932 --> 00:54:20.379]  I don't take personal pleasure out of going down to UT, and I don't care if they're Asian, white, black, you name it.
[00:54:20.399 --> 00:54:23.061]  90% of them look like the walking dead.
[00:54:23.641 --> 00:54:25.143]  I was at the beach.
[00:54:27.466 --> 00:54:32.751]  Years ago, with Richard Reeves, he would drive the bus when I was on the road doing a tour, and take my family with me.
[00:54:33.611 --> 00:54:34.932]  And Richard said, you notice anything here?
[00:54:35.493 --> 00:54:37.054]  And we'd be at, you know, the beach.
[00:54:37.675 --> 00:54:41.097]  And I go, yeah, women don't look like they did just 10 years ago.
[00:54:41.118 --> 00:54:42.479]  And he goes, no, it's not just that they're fat.
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:44.660]  And the men, too.
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:45.601]  He goes, they look sick.
[00:54:46.582 --> 00:54:47.223]  They don't look well.
[00:54:47.443 --> 00:54:48.444]  They look deformed, don't they?
[00:54:49.525 --> 00:54:50.445]  And I said, yeah, you're right.
[00:54:50.465 --> 00:54:50.986]  And it's true.
[00:54:51.006 --> 00:54:52.647]  I mean, me included.
[00:54:52.687 --> 00:54:54.609]  I mean, it's been a battle to lose 60-something pounds.
[00:54:56.657 --> 00:54:58.019]  You look at black-and-white photos.
[00:54:58.059 --> 00:55:00.481]  You look at old, you know, Super 8 reels.
[00:55:01.522 --> 00:55:03.484]  People ate, smoked more, you name it, looked better.
[00:55:03.504 --> 00:55:04.325]  Look at the French today.
[00:55:04.345 --> 00:55:05.066]  They don't eat GMO.
[00:55:05.466 --> 00:55:05.987]  They look good.
[00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:12.574]  And you go over there and you look at UT, folks.
[00:55:12.754 --> 00:55:15.256]  I mean, it's the walking dead.
[00:55:15.657 --> 00:55:17.359]  Not just overweight, but
[00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:22.553]  Just dead-eyed looking and gray skin, greenish skin.
[00:55:22.573 --> 00:55:23.493]  I don't care what color they are.
[00:55:23.894 --> 00:55:25.415]  Just shuffling around.
[00:55:25.915 --> 00:55:26.856]  They're dead already.
[00:55:26.976 --> 00:55:29.497]  I'm not putting them down to make myself feel good.
[00:55:29.537 --> 00:55:30.018]  I'm saying...
[00:55:31.567 --> 00:55:32.608]  Look how dumb you are.
[00:55:32.708 --> 00:55:38.153]  I don't want to go show that 90% of people don't know what the Fourth Amendment is so we look big.
[00:55:38.753 --> 00:55:42.316]  We have to do these mail-on-the-streets to show people that are awake.
[00:55:42.657 --> 00:55:49.803]  It's why they have national polls every year of college grads and, you know, 67% don't know who the second president was or don't know the three branches of government.
[00:55:50.063 --> 00:55:52.125]  You do that to show as a gauge.
[00:55:52.545 --> 00:55:53.246]  You know, my car
[00:55:54.511 --> 00:56:01.155]  Had one of the gaskets blow off about a month ago from the water cooler, and the water dumped out as I was going down the road.
[00:56:01.195 --> 00:56:02.635]  I saw some water smoke.
[00:56:02.956 --> 00:56:04.416]  I thought, oh, and I saw the heat going up.
[00:56:04.696 --> 00:56:08.739]  It wasn't a power trip against my car that the heat went up and I knew that I'd lost the water.
[00:56:08.759 --> 00:56:12.961]  It wasn't an arrogance to go, oh, look, I'm more powerful than the car.
[00:56:13.341 --> 00:56:13.921]  It's hot.
[00:56:15.122 --> 00:56:17.703]  It's a gauge that we're in trouble.
[00:56:18.224 --> 00:56:22.266]  But see, that's the political correctness that permeates everybody.
[00:56:23.865 --> 00:56:27.026]  Where you don't want to show somebody they've been screwed over or they're in trouble.
[00:56:27.447 --> 00:56:29.668]  You don't want to be strong about it because you're putting them down.
[00:56:29.848 --> 00:56:31.348]  And I'm not putting Buckley and Leanne down.
[00:56:31.969 --> 00:56:38.631]  But it's the judgment on me, see, that I must have been doing that because I wanted to be mean to somebody.
[00:56:38.912 --> 00:56:40.532]  I don't want them to take the vaccines.
[00:56:40.752 --> 00:56:42.613]  I don't want them to get robbed by the Federal Reserve.
[00:56:42.833 --> 00:56:44.094]  I want them to have a future.
[00:56:44.594 --> 00:56:46.255]  I'm in their face because I love them!
[00:56:47.318 --> 00:56:48.178]  Don't you get that?
[00:56:48.998 --> 00:56:50.859]  But see, it's not... My mom will get mad.
[00:56:50.899 --> 00:56:51.719]  My dad will get mad.
[00:56:51.779 --> 00:56:52.559]  It's not that they're bad.
[00:56:52.719 --> 00:56:53.760]  They're good, sweet people.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.720]  And we've been run over because we're too sweet.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.181]  It's time to stop being sweet about any of this!
[00:56:59.541 --> 00:57:00.761]  They're selling baby parts!
[00:57:00.881 --> 00:57:02.022]  They're keeping them alive!
[00:57:03.342 --> 00:57:04.442]  We've been screwed over!
[00:57:05.122 --> 00:57:06.983]  We've got anger for a reason!
[00:57:08.843 --> 00:57:13.505]  Like, I'm going down there and I'm getting in all their faces.
[00:57:14.565 --> 00:57:15.025]  Sick of it!
[00:57:17.065 --> 00:57:20.046]  You see people walking into a concentration camp, you better warn them.
[00:57:20.066 --> 00:57:22.167]  Especially if they're laughing at you.
[00:57:23.788 --> 00:57:26.009]  Those people need to be ridiculed into waking up.
[00:57:26.029 --> 00:57:39.116]  90% of the people, 90% of the people in the Mark Dice videos want to put gun owners in concentration camps.
[00:57:41.557 --> 00:57:43.898]  Some of those people might need to get slapped upside their head.
[00:57:43.918 --> 00:57:45.759]  They're dangerous.
[00:57:46.687 --> 00:57:47.868]  Their ignorance is dangerous.
[00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.991]  I don't have time to plug it.
[00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:51.012]  I didn't even plug this out.
[00:57:51.052 --> 00:57:51.593]  I skipped a break.
[00:57:51.653 --> 00:57:53.515]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:53.715 --> 00:57:54.476]  Go buy all the products.
[00:57:54.496 --> 00:57:55.197]  They're game changers.
[00:57:55.237 --> 00:57:55.617]  You need them.
[00:57:55.838 --> 00:57:57.239]  If you don't get X2, you're crazy.
[00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:57.760]  Look at this.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:01.304]  Adding iodine to salt may have helped boost America's IQ 15 points.
[00:58:02.005 --> 00:58:04.588]  That's from major studies, and that's out of the Business Insider.
[00:58:04.828 --> 00:58:05.349]  Boom, right there.
[00:58:06.884 --> 00:58:11.349]  X2 is the iodine that I'm able to hold down, that's palatable, that's so pure.
[00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:12.991]  It's a total game changer.
[00:58:13.051 --> 00:58:14.132]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:14.573 --> 00:58:17.255]  And now they've got big studies we're going to cover a little bit coming up later.
[00:58:18.089 --> 00:58:21.630]  Where the thyroid is what's regulating gut flora more than anything.
[00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:26.351]  And because you're not just depleted of good bacteria, you're depleted with fluoride in your thyroid.
[00:58:26.511 --> 00:58:27.351]  It cuts that off.
[00:58:27.791 --> 00:58:30.251]  So your gut's basically turned off on top of it.
[00:58:30.711 --> 00:58:33.752]  So it's just as important as probiotics, in my view, and Dr. Group agrees with that.

[00:58:51.177 --> 00:58:53.319]  I'm gonna ram this train up the Globalist, you know what.
[00:58:53.699 --> 00:58:55.840]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.601 --> 00:58:59.482]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:58:59.522 --> 00:58:59.942]  Good, brother.
[00:59:00.102 --> 00:59:01.783]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:59:01.823 --> 00:59:03.624]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:59:03.764 --> 00:59:07.766]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:59:07.786 --> 00:59:08.527]  Well, thank you, brother.
[00:59:08.547 --> 00:59:12.649]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:20.694]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:59:21.014 --> 00:59:24.117]  We did a super male and a super female vitality.
[00:59:24.257 --> 00:59:25.758]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:59:25.798 --> 00:59:28.701]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:59:28.721 --> 00:59:30.182]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:59:30.483 --> 00:59:32.965]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[00:59:33.205 --> 00:59:36.288]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[00:59:36.488 --> 00:59:39.130]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:09.813 --> 01:00:14.878]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.239 --> 01:00:17.561]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:00:19.884 --> 01:00:24.428]  Okay, I went off into some rants there at the end of that hour.
[01:00:25.942 --> 01:00:27.703]  I want to get into all the other news I haven't hit yet.
[01:00:27.984 --> 01:00:29.565]  I want to take your phone calls as well.
[01:00:30.045 --> 01:00:38.752]  Gerald Solentes will be with us for the hour, but I promise that at 33 after, we're not going to wait until 15 till the end of the hour and then go to a few calls.
[01:00:39.152 --> 01:00:49.841]  I promise on election 2016 on Russia saying they're going to pull out of Syria, on North Korea threatening to nuke everyone, unprecedented on what's happening in the economy, Donald Trump, whatever you want to discuss.
[01:00:50.441 --> 01:00:52.922]  I'm going to give the number out coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:52.942 --> 01:00:55.524]  It's not open yet, and we're going to take your calls at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:55.544 --> 01:00:57.965]  Gerald Cilente, the Trends Forecaster, is going to be joining us.
[01:00:57.985 --> 01:01:00.167]  Dr. Group pops in for 30 minutes on huge medical news.
[01:01:00.547 --> 01:01:02.028]  David Knight hosts the fourth hour.
[01:01:04.749 --> 01:01:14.535]  But if you just joined us, I was getting into the fact that I don't ridicule the people that are being scammed by Southwest, but I've actually had multiple people I know over the years
[01:01:16.067 --> 01:01:20.631]  Who are being caught in a known marketing scam and they won't believe that it's a scam.
[01:01:20.651 --> 01:01:23.273]  It's like talking to a compulsive gambler that goes and plays slot machines.
[01:01:24.093 --> 01:01:29.218]  And it's one thing if you can do it and you don't have a family, but if you're mortgaging the house to do it, you need to be ridiculed.
[01:01:29.238 --> 01:01:30.238]  Somebody needs to get in your face.
[01:01:30.258 --> 01:01:34.642]  I mean, how else do you get people to wake up?
[01:01:35.182 --> 01:01:37.024]  I found ridicule is really one of the ways to do it.
[01:01:39.806 --> 01:01:42.608]  Very painful to do it, but I'll do it.
[01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:44.370]  I don't enjoy it.
[01:01:45.916 --> 01:01:47.817]  But I enjoy seeing it get results.
[01:01:49.777 --> 01:01:54.439]  Think it's fun to get up here two months before 9-11 and say they're going to blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on Bin Laden?
[01:01:55.719 --> 01:01:55.979]  Get it?
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:58.920]  I will do what has to be done.
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:05.923]  I could care less when I've been at City Council years ago and they're all laughing at me about fluoride causing cancer and I have the studies right there.
[01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:07.844]  I'm trying to save lives.
[01:02:08.204 --> 01:02:11.745]  You think I care what big bags of filth think about me?
[01:02:16.331 --> 01:02:19.272]  And see, Trump doesn't care either, and that's why this is so exciting.
[01:02:19.732 --> 01:02:22.872]  And Trump needs to come out and say, we're not going to shut off our coal plants.
[01:02:23.232 --> 01:02:25.073]  That's the real reason we can't compete with China.
[01:02:25.333 --> 01:02:26.633]  That's the real internal tariff.
[01:02:26.873 --> 01:02:28.913]  And I'm going to tweak that at him, actually, during the break.
[01:02:32.354 --> 01:02:44.896]  Shutting off coal power plants is what's making... Shutting off coal plants... Obama shutting down coal plants... is helping China.
[01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:50.565]  Trump, please turn the coal back on.
[01:02:50.625 --> 01:02:51.306]  Something like that.
[01:02:51.906 --> 01:02:55.009]  Or Trump, please promise to defend coal, give us cheaper energy.
[01:02:55.089 --> 01:02:57.472]  That's the key to competing with China.
[01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:06.180]  Because I'm telling you, I relayed messages through Stone to Trump some, I've seen it through other people, and Trump responds.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.061]  It is amazing.
[01:03:08.871 --> 01:03:12.634]  I was like, please talk to him today about the Federal Reserve saying he wants to audit it, where he stands.
[01:03:12.674 --> 01:03:15.756]  He goes, well, actually, I know he's against it, and I know he wants to go up against him.
[01:03:15.796 --> 01:03:16.337]  I'll talk to him.
[01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:17.437]  And then, like, the next week, he did it.
[01:03:18.458 --> 01:03:21.460]  Stone's like, I don't want to get into too much inside baseball, but it's pretty amazing.
[01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:22.621]  It's pretty amazing.
[01:03:23.162 --> 01:03:24.122]  He talked to him a lot.
[01:03:24.142 --> 01:03:25.043]  He didn't want people to know how much.
[01:03:25.063 --> 01:03:28.746]  But the point is, is that I've been sitting there with him at dinner when Trump calls up.
[01:03:28.906 --> 01:03:29.727]  He leaves for 20 minutes.
[01:03:32.248 --> 01:03:32.729]  Repeatedly.
[01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:35.631]  So he's like his buddy.
[01:03:36.251 --> 01:03:38.153]  And see, that's what Stone says is weird, is that
[01:03:39.892 --> 01:03:41.653]  These guys have been like going out to dinner and hanging out.
[01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:44.414]  And when Trump was divorced and stuff, you know, they go out and double date forever.
[01:03:44.434 --> 01:03:46.294]  I know I'm supposed to be telling all this.
[01:03:46.314 --> 01:03:47.755]  The point is, Stone's like his buddy.
[01:03:48.915 --> 01:03:49.635]  One of his best friends.
[01:03:50.315 --> 01:03:52.596]  And the inside baseball is just incredible.
[01:03:53.116 --> 01:03:55.117]  And that's why the system is so scared of Trump, folks.
[01:03:55.137 --> 01:03:56.458]  He is a wild man.
[01:03:56.478 --> 01:03:57.898]  He's a real guy.
[01:03:59.599 --> 01:04:00.479]  But I'm digressing.
[01:04:03.024 --> 01:04:05.306]  We need to nakedly say what we think.
[01:04:05.446 --> 01:04:08.609]  Even if I disagree with people on some things, I like it when they say what they really think.
[01:04:08.889 --> 01:04:09.870]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:19.098]  Now we're going to come back with Gerald Cilente and talk about all this and more and how the whole power structure is coming after Trump, the military news, the trends, you name it.
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:25.263]  And also the fact that Stone had mentioned this yesterday.
[01:04:27.093 --> 01:04:34.936]  This Tommy DeMossimo, and I've heard this and read this, but sure enough, on his own Facebook, it's him with an Al-Qaeda flag and an Uzi.
[01:04:36.697 --> 01:04:38.297]  And that's what I've seen at leftist events.
[01:04:38.317 --> 01:04:45.120]  This guy, like, goes around and stomps on American flags and waves ISIS flags and, you know, this guy isn't even a Muslim.
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:49.561]  They're just into anything trashy and seedy and evil.
[01:04:50.582 --> 01:04:51.522]  Because they're wimps.
[01:04:52.883 --> 01:04:53.303]  They're punks.
[01:04:54.748 --> 01:04:57.470]  And they want to intimidate our free speech and shut our free speech down.
[01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:59.791]  It's never gonna happen.
[01:05:00.191 --> 01:05:05.994]  And the fact that we now have a conduit where we can see the results of resistance is the beginning of the end for the establishment.
[01:05:06.014 --> 01:05:07.575]  I'm telling you, this is a big time to be alive.
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:18.749]  A 7-Eleven shopper in Washington State relied on his concealed carry firearm over the weekend to subdue a man who attacked customers and staff with a small axe.
[01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:20.431]  Just before 6 a.m.
[01:05:20.491 --> 01:05:29.399]  Sunday, a masked man entered a convenience store in Seattle and began swinging a hatchet at both customers and the store clerk before attacking the cashier.
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:31.581]  Reports KOMO News.
[01:05:32.322 --> 01:05:39.584]  We don't know if the intent was to commit a robbery because the suspect didn't say anything, a King County Sheriff's Sergeant said.
[01:05:40.064 --> 01:05:46.246]  An armed store patron was sitting and having coffee at the exact moment the axe-wielding suspect entered.
[01:05:46.826 --> 01:05:54.988]  The 60-year-old man, who has reportedly visited the store nearly every day for the past 12 years, shot and killed the suspect.
[01:05:55.508 --> 01:06:01.190]  The store clerk, age 58, suffered a minor injury to his stomach and is expected to recover.
[01:06:01.871 --> 01:06:05.302]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[01:06:08.376 --> 01:06:08.836]  Hey, everyone!
[01:06:09.196 --> 01:06:11.457]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:06:11.477 --> 01:06:15.059]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:06:15.319 --> 01:06:16.920]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:27.324]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:33.667]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:06:34.127 --> 01:06:54.474]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfoWarsTeam.com.

[01:07:09.552 --> 01:07:12.954]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:07:13.315 --> 01:07:20.439]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:29.405]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:07:29.686 --> 01:07:33.768]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:07:34.089 --> 01:07:39.232]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:07:39.672 --> 01:07:43.495]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:07:43.915 --> 01:07:47.018]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:07:47.318 --> 01:07:58.426]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:21.811]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:08:22.851 --> 01:08:32.460]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.140]  Welcome back.
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:37.784]  We're now well into the second hour broadcasting worldwide for the balance of the hour.
[01:08:37.804 --> 01:08:42.308]  Gerald Cilente, my good friend and top trends forecaster will be with us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:42.328 --> 01:08:43.429]  We start going to your calls.
[01:08:43.509 --> 01:08:46.732]  Any question, any comment you have for myself or Gerald Cilente,
[01:08:47.512 --> 01:08:55.674]  The toll-free number, and it's going to be wide open, first-time callers, long-time callers, agree with us, disagree with us, whatever the case is, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, to join us on the sides of March.
[01:08:55.734 --> 01:08:57.894]  And of course, we're going into this next big primary today.
[01:09:09.497 --> 01:09:13.899]  Trump in national polls that are already covered, scientific polls, is over 50% now.
[01:09:13.939 --> 01:09:16.840]  He's only surging as they try to ban his free speech.
[01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:27.985]  So their response in the Washington Post, WhiteHouse.gov, foreign newspapers, the Pope, the Chinese government, the Japanese government, is you can't have Trump.
[01:09:29.246 --> 01:09:31.607]  Well, the Japanese say you can't have it because that'd be disrespectful.
[01:09:31.647 --> 01:09:33.048]  They say, we fear Trump.
[01:09:33.828 --> 01:09:35.609]  The Chinese say you can't have him, we're your boss.
[01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:38.030]  Basically, we own your debt, we tell Hollywood what to do.
[01:09:39.332 --> 01:09:41.614]  You know, we kill our dissidents over here, so watch it.
[01:09:42.715 --> 01:09:45.857]  Donald Trump's rise sparks alarm in Japan, CNBC.
[01:09:46.177 --> 01:09:49.840]  Soros alarmed by Trump, pours money into 2016 race.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:10:00.788]  And we have an exclusive interview with Bill Clinton, about two minutes long, two and a half minutes long, up on Infowars.com, there in one of the photo lines that our crew in Florida just got.
[01:10:01.909 --> 01:10:04.090]  And I'm not going to play it because of time issues.
[01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:05.671]  It's on infortware.com if you want to see it.
[01:10:05.931 --> 01:10:09.473]  He talks about George Soros and how he got to know him back during the Balkans.
[01:10:10.034 --> 01:10:11.054]  He's been helping a lot.
[01:10:11.455 --> 01:10:14.877]  Yeah, I'm not Serb, I'm not Croat, I'm not Muslim, okay?
[01:10:15.137 --> 01:10:15.897]  But I studied it.
[01:10:15.937 --> 01:10:21.600]  The UN report admits that the Croats and the Muslims started the fights not once but twice.
[01:10:22.501 --> 01:10:25.823]  That is literally where the crusades began in that area because they kept getting invaded.
[01:10:26.183 --> 01:10:28.444]  Albania is Sunni Muslim.
[01:10:29.705 --> 01:10:30.826]  Same folks that have gone to Syria.
[01:10:32.108 --> 01:10:34.410]  And they killed double the number of Serbs.
[01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:46.618]  They started both wars, but they've got dozens and dozens of Hollywood movies and TV shows and Christina Amanpour showing a guy with tuberculosis behind a UN barbed wire fence trying to get in the food, saying he was a concentration camp victim.
[01:10:46.638 --> 01:10:47.259]  Remember that?
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.901]  And British ITN admitting it was all lies.
[01:10:51.041 --> 01:11:01.569]  And then they bomb Belgrade with DU weapons and blow up their water plants, their power plants, their TV stations, and give a third of the country of Serbia
[01:11:03.251 --> 01:11:07.013]  That borders Albania to the Muslims, and now a decade plus later, on record.
[01:11:07.993 --> 01:11:10.975]  They've killed almost all of them, or driven them out, over a million people.
[01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:13.596]  They go door to door and they kill the Christians that stayed.
[01:11:15.357 --> 01:11:18.479]  So, just get your mind around that.
[01:11:18.499 --> 01:11:21.180]  And Hillary says that Libya, they got their objectives.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.141]  It's not a failed state.
[01:11:22.521 --> 01:11:24.662]  They wanted a failed state, and nobody died.
[01:11:24.962 --> 01:11:31.025]  Not the hundreds of thousands of non-radical Muslims and blacks, because the racist Wahhabis from Saudi Arabia that ran that out of Benghazi.
[01:11:31.265 --> 01:11:32.426]  They don't like black people.
[01:11:33.246 --> 01:11:39.511]  They wrote the book saying they weren't human so they could enslave them, cut their genitals off as eunuchs and use them as slaves.
[01:11:40.151 --> 01:11:41.572]  Unestimated, what's the number?
[01:11:41.592 --> 01:11:44.815]  300 million black slaves killed by the Muslims?
[01:11:44.935 --> 01:11:46.196]  I'm not even bashing Muslims here.
[01:11:46.476 --> 01:11:48.077]  I'm just saying what went on out of Saudi Arabia.
[01:11:50.479 --> 01:11:51.100]  But that's okay.
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:54.602]  It's okay they're killing the blacks right now in Libya because that's cutesy, right?
[01:11:54.903 --> 01:11:56.924]  That's why Louis Farrakhan's even come out against Obama.
[01:11:57.264 --> 01:11:58.645]  Because he knows, he knew Gaddafi.
[01:11:59.106 --> 01:12:01.608]  These are the unbelievable war crimes and she just says, hey,
[01:12:02.836 --> 01:12:03.596]  Everything's wonderful.
[01:12:04.657 --> 01:12:05.497]  Lie after lie.
[01:12:05.517 --> 01:12:11.078]  You know, she had bigger lies than Brian Williams about being shot at, speaking of the Balkans.
[01:12:11.218 --> 01:12:11.719]  All lies!
[01:12:12.039 --> 01:12:14.559]  But to her constituents, it doesn't matter.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:22.962]  But I want to ask Gerald Solente what he thinks about this moment in time and how this affects his trends and where he sees this going.
[01:12:22.982 --> 01:12:27.583]  To have the Washington Post saying maybe Trump needs to be indicted or arrested.
[01:12:27.723 --> 01:12:29.984]  It's his fault people are attacking him for his speech.
[01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.073]  That's political correctness on steroids.
[01:12:33.574 --> 01:12:35.094]  And you got the Sheriff's Department saying it.
[01:12:35.114 --> 01:12:36.594]  You got all these people saying it.
[01:12:37.655 --> 01:12:39.655]  But that's only one block of what I want to talk about with him.
[01:12:39.975 --> 01:12:42.216]  The economy's unraveling all over the world.
[01:12:42.696 --> 01:12:44.197]  Frightening over-the-top signs.
[01:12:44.657 --> 01:12:45.777]  It's hard to leave it in the news here.
[01:12:46.377 --> 01:12:47.618]  They just tell us how great we're doing.
[01:12:48.418 --> 01:12:48.918]  Separately.
[01:12:50.441 --> 01:12:57.327]  You got North Korea threatening to nuke South Korea, threatening to nuke Japan, threatening to nuke Manhattan, to the point of the Chinese and the Russians are threatening intervention.
[01:12:57.547 --> 01:13:00.249]  The Russians who have a border with them, in their north.
[01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:03.312]  The north of North Korea borders a small sliver with Russia.
[01:13:03.993 --> 01:13:07.656]  Russia is threatening to invade, it has a big military force there last week.
[01:13:08.396 --> 01:13:10.078]  I see a meme on the internet.
[01:13:11.257 --> 01:13:12.258]  That I made that up.
[01:13:12.378 --> 01:13:21.904]  Type in, Russia threatens to invade, and you get foreign Russian news, RT, British news, almost no US news, and then a meme that I'm fear-mongering.
[01:13:24.606 --> 01:13:30.490]  So again, America is so insulated from the rest of the world, they have no idea how crazy it is.
[01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:31.731]  And what does Gerald talk about in history?
[01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:34.993]  When economic collapse accelerates, they always take you to war.
[01:13:36.613 --> 01:13:39.494]  They're trying, well, Gerald, I'm ranting, I set the table there.
[01:13:40.355 --> 01:13:44.637]  You want to tackle the geopolitical stuff first, or do you want to get into Trump and the election first?
[01:13:44.657 --> 01:13:46.658]  Because, I mean, I know your view, but I want you to elaborate.
[01:13:47.278 --> 01:13:54.602]  Trump is the manifestation of the populist rebellion, and the RNC is saying, officially, we're going to take the delegates and not give it to him.
[01:13:55.002 --> 01:13:57.764]  Will they really be that willing to be that naked?
[01:13:58.084 --> 01:14:04.387]  And are we reaching that magic moment now where the scales come off the eyes and never go back again, Gerald?
[01:14:05.626 --> 01:14:08.954]  Well, first I'd like to start with what you were talking about with Serbia.
[01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:15.591]  And how that bloody war was started by the Clinton administration, Bill Clinton.
[01:14:16.271 --> 01:14:18.412]  And Clinton's hands are filled with blood.
[01:14:18.812 --> 01:14:25.233]  People forget that he was bombing Baghdad and Iraq during his entire two terms.
[01:14:25.733 --> 01:14:30.394]  Matter of fact, that was one of the first things he did, was bombs away over Baghdad.
[01:14:31.074 --> 01:14:35.555]  And, you know, I hear Hillary Clinton talking about her being a progressive liberal.
[01:14:36.215 --> 01:14:39.216]  And you look at their, again, the blood on their hands.
[01:14:39.596 --> 01:14:54.620]  There's that interview with Madeleine Albright, the Secretary of State under Clinton, and she's asked by Leslie Stahl, and anyone could of course Google this up, if the price of sanctions that Bill Clinton put on Iraq
[01:14:55.796 --> 01:15:02.938]  We're worth the price of 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five dead.
[01:15:03.518 --> 01:15:06.519]  And Madeleine Albright says, yes it was.
[01:15:07.419 --> 01:15:09.900]  And then you talked about the Serbian war.
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:19.443]  And all those Bernie Sanders supporters out there, you know, this Bernie Sanders, you know, you know, I know the act, the Coney Island Act, Bernie, save it.
[01:15:20.143 --> 01:15:23.287]  What they don't talk about is Bernie, B.S.
[01:15:23.387 --> 01:15:26.370]  Bernie, who plays, I voted against the Iraq War.
[01:15:27.331 --> 01:15:32.497]  He got people arrested for protesting Bill Clinton's Serbian-Kosovo War.
[01:15:33.057 --> 01:15:34.959]  But they never talk about that either.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.462]  On to the Donald Trump issue.
[01:15:42.184 --> 01:15:44.465]  There's things I like about Trump, things I don't.
[01:15:44.485 --> 01:15:48.766]  I'm not going to take a stand on it, but I do take a definite stand on this.
[01:15:49.547 --> 01:15:54.388]  You know, we held Occupy Peace over here in Kingston this past September.
[01:15:55.208 --> 01:15:57.229]  We put our own money into making it happen.
[01:15:57.269 --> 01:16:01.650]  We had Ralph Nader, Cindy Sheehan, Dr. Robert Thurman, Gary Null.
[01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:05.171]  And, you know, we staged closed down the street.
[01:16:05.472 --> 01:16:09.893]  And I got some jerk yelling out for Bernie Sanders and interrupting.
[01:16:11.112 --> 01:16:12.433]  I don't want to hear this stuff.
[01:16:12.933 --> 01:16:17.016]  You know, we have our own group of guys that know what we're doing over here.
[01:16:17.036 --> 01:16:19.097]  We quieted the situation down right away.
[01:16:19.798 --> 01:16:24.061]  If people want to go and protest, have their own protest.
[01:16:24.401 --> 01:16:29.244]  You don't go screaming and yelling when Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton or anybody else is here.
[01:16:29.264 --> 01:16:30.365]  It's very brown shirt.
[01:16:30.445 --> 01:16:34.188]  They come and link hands and say, excuse us, coming through, run you over.
[01:16:34.748 --> 01:16:36.570]  And then you're not allowed to defend yourself.
[01:16:36.891 --> 01:16:37.992]  They want a silent speech.
[01:16:38.032 --> 01:16:39.573]  They admit they want to shut Trump up.
[01:16:39.614 --> 01:16:40.975]  Well, they can shut him up.
[01:16:41.015 --> 01:16:42.096]  They can shut any of us up.
[01:16:42.717 --> 01:16:43.318]  Exactly.
[01:16:43.358 --> 01:16:44.259]  They have no right.
[01:16:44.499 --> 01:16:45.780]  They have no right doing it.
[01:16:46.121 --> 01:16:55.070]  And to make the point where all these little liberals, you know, like the kind we have over here in Woodstock, you know, the phonies up there.
[01:16:55.831 --> 01:17:03.635]  Try speaking out at a public meeting, a school board meeting, when your time is up.
[01:17:04.255 --> 01:17:06.617]  Try speaking out in City Hall.
[01:17:07.177 --> 01:17:12.500]  Try speaking out in the Senate BS Committee meetings, or Congressional.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:14.341]  Man, they've got you locked up!
[01:17:14.361 --> 01:17:17.022]  That's right, they're trying to shut down citizen demonstrations.
[01:17:17.302 --> 01:17:22.145]  The government's trying, with social engineering, to disrupt true populist movements.
[01:17:23.168 --> 01:17:25.551]  What I'm saying is you're not allowed to do it.
[01:17:26.331 --> 01:17:29.715]  You're not allowed to do it in any of those venues that I just talked about.
[01:17:30.356 --> 01:17:39.265]  What right does some clown with a big mouth and a bad attitude have to go into somebody else's show and yell and scream?
[01:17:39.966 --> 01:17:41.267]  They have no right at all.
[01:17:41.508 --> 01:17:51.697]  But to meet, again, go to your school board meetings, your city hall meetings, town hall meetings, senate committee meetings, and try speaking out and interrupting.
[01:17:51.977 --> 01:17:53.218]  How long would they take it?
[01:17:53.539 --> 01:17:56.281]  And if you said, get this guy out of here, who is that?
[01:17:56.702 --> 01:17:57.523]  He or she?
[01:17:58.163 --> 01:17:59.464]  You're not condemned for it.
[01:18:00.225 --> 01:18:05.246]  But yet, when, you know, Trump's saying, you know, who are these people every time I'm talking, disrupting me?
[01:18:05.526 --> 01:18:09.767]  People came from all over to come and hear me speak, and it's the same thing with me!
[01:18:10.087 --> 01:18:14.208]  If I'm speaking and having a real, I don't want somebody yelling out, put on your own show!
[01:18:14.448 --> 01:18:16.289]  They came here to hear me, they didn't come here to hear you!
[01:18:16.309 --> 01:18:27.351]  Well, that's right, he pays for arenas, he pays for the hangers, and then, I mean, to me, one thing he was doing at the town square, then you could see some protests or something, but these are pretty much private events, and they're trying to attack free association.
[01:18:27.571 --> 01:18:34.997]  They're trying to take our free speech away, and they'll go in with a hundred people and space it out to just ruin the whole event.
[01:18:36.118 --> 01:18:41.762]  Now, going to Chicago, you know, was it MoveOn, was it George Soros?
[01:18:41.822 --> 01:18:42.082]  Yes.
[01:18:42.102 --> 01:18:46.546]  Let's put something else into perspective here, just to make it really clear.
[01:18:46.826 --> 01:18:47.987]  And I'm not making this up.
[01:18:48.007 --> 01:18:50.809]  George Soros is a war criminal, Nazi collaborator, piece of filth.
[01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:54.232]  I lived in Chicago for six years.
[01:18:55.049 --> 01:18:55.569]  Here it is.
[01:18:55.589 --> 01:19:04.553]  This is from last May, May 28, 2015, from Chicago's Crain's Business News.
[01:19:05.634 --> 01:19:10.256]  Chicago is still number one for public corruption.
[01:19:11.471 --> 01:19:14.373]  It's ranked that high for like 40 years in a row.
[01:19:14.893 --> 01:19:18.275]  One of the most corrupt cities in the United States.
[01:19:18.595 --> 01:19:19.556]  And who's the mayor?
[01:19:20.356 --> 01:19:21.277]  Rahm Emanuel.
[01:19:21.337 --> 01:19:22.217]  Rahm Emanuel.
[01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:25.099]  Wasn't he with the Bill Clinton gang?
[01:19:25.819 --> 01:19:26.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.200]  What was he?
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.241]  Let's see.
[01:19:28.861 --> 01:19:29.962]  Rahm Emanuel.
[01:19:30.822 --> 01:19:48.413]  He was President Clinton's President for Political Affairs under Clinton, Assistant to the President for Political Affairs, Senior Advisor to the President for Policy and Strategy, 1992 Presidential Campaign, he was the Director of the Finance Committee.
[01:19:48.433 --> 01:19:56.758]  Oh, oh, and by the way, he was also President Barack Obama's White House Chief of Staff.
[01:19:57.279 --> 01:19:58.519]  Oh, oh, Chicago!
[01:20:00.689 --> 01:20:03.670]  William Daley, you know, the Daley machine?
[01:20:04.170 --> 01:20:08.311]  Oh, he was White House Chief of Staff under Obama and U.S.
[01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:11.972]  Secretary, head of the Commerce Department, U.S.
[01:20:11.992 --> 01:20:15.313]  Secretary of Commerce under Bill Clinton in his administration.
[01:20:15.773 --> 01:20:16.794]  So let's add this.
[01:20:18.456 --> 01:20:21.720]  I mean look at the gang running the show over there.
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:24.664]  You think this did happen by mistake?
[01:20:25.005 --> 01:20:29.470]  You think they couldn't have quieted it down or seen it coming and done something?
[01:20:29.851 --> 01:20:36.520]  It's one of the most corrupt, it is the most corrupt city in the United States and they showed it live.
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:38.361]  And that's the model of government they want.
[01:20:38.381 --> 01:20:45.266]  The late, great Aaron Russo, who, you know, produced a lot of big Hollywood movies with Eddie Murphy, you name it, who died of cancer in 2007, or was it 2008?
[01:20:45.306 --> 01:20:59.695]  I was talking to him right before the last few days he died, and he told the story about when he was first bringing Led Zeppelin to the U.S., and they'd have like 10,000 people at this theater he bought in Chicago, and first they came and said, give us protection money.
[01:20:59.755 --> 01:21:00.335]  He said, no.
[01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:03.638]  So they had the fire department come in and dump garbage everywhere in front of them,
[01:21:04.258 --> 01:21:15.691]  Then they had the inspector behind them to give them huge fees, and they said, listen, you give us the money, you let us see how much you're making, you pay it directly to the police and to us, or we're going to basically shut you down.
[01:21:16.091 --> 01:21:22.658]  He paid them off for a year and a half, then the government itself, through a city official, opened another theater down the road.
[01:21:23.579 --> 01:21:29.044]  Came in, dumped garbage around everywhere, beat him up, and the police took him in the back of the paddy wagon.
[01:21:29.104 --> 01:21:30.085]  He said, OK, I'm not resisting.
[01:21:30.105 --> 01:21:31.387]  And they said, we don't care.
[01:21:31.407 --> 01:21:32.187]  You think you're going to make money?
[01:21:32.528 --> 01:21:35.951]  And they literally began beating his testicles with the Billy Club.
[01:21:36.511 --> 01:21:38.153]  So you want to live under that, folks?
[01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:41.336]  That's who the Clintons and Obama are.
[01:21:41.376 --> 01:21:45.980]  They are literal Chicago machine mafia, and that's what they want.
[01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:47.041]  Gerald, is that what you're getting at?
[01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.303]  That's exactly what I'm getting at.
[01:21:49.343 --> 01:21:50.583]  Let's call it what it is.
[01:21:50.943 --> 01:21:53.184]  Oh, and by the way, where did Obama come from?
[01:21:53.484 --> 01:21:54.585]  Oh, Chicago, right.
[01:21:54.885 --> 01:21:57.906]  The community organizer that never organized anything.
[01:21:58.486 --> 01:21:59.787]  And who was the front forum?
[01:22:00.227 --> 01:22:01.747]  Oh, the Pritzker family.
[01:22:01.987 --> 01:22:02.448]  Pritzker.
[01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:03.548]  Hyatt Hotel.
[01:22:03.868 --> 01:22:04.749]  Oh, those Pritzkers.
[01:22:05.009 --> 01:22:06.489]  Oh, who's the Commerce Secretary?
[01:22:06.829 --> 01:22:07.810]  Penny Pritzker.
[01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:09.570]  Oh, where's Penny going now?
[01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:10.931]  To Cuba.
[01:22:11.391 --> 01:22:12.572]  What are they doing now?
[01:22:13.052 --> 01:22:15.294]  Oh, you think they'll open up any hotels?
[01:22:15.634 --> 01:22:16.895]  The game is rigged.
[01:22:17.255 --> 01:22:19.216]  It's the Mafia.
[01:22:19.296 --> 01:22:21.198]  Don't blame the Italians, man.
[01:22:21.538 --> 01:22:23.039]  Daley's not Italian.
[01:22:23.399 --> 01:22:25.300]  Rahm Emanuel's not Italian.
[01:22:25.661 --> 01:22:29.183]  Mafia comes in all races, creeds, and colors.
[01:22:29.583 --> 01:22:30.984]  So save it, folks.
[01:22:31.424 --> 01:22:32.005]  It's not Italian.
[01:22:32.025 --> 01:22:34.847]  Sure, I don't bring this up because you're Italian, but we've talked about this many times at dinner.
[01:22:34.927 --> 01:22:35.567]  It's true.
[01:22:36.048 --> 01:22:37.128]  It's another great hoax.
[01:22:37.188 --> 01:22:39.190]  They branded the only organized crime
[01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:44.872]  As Italian, so all the real organized crime could sit there and operate and do whatever it wanted to.
[01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:46.873]  I've actually studied organized crime.
[01:22:47.133 --> 01:22:51.896]  The most powerful organized crime are the big robber baron families that own and run the whole show.
[01:22:51.956 --> 01:22:58.078]  It's not, it's not guys shaking down, you know, mom and pop stores in New York City.
[01:22:58.318 --> 01:22:59.199]  I mean, what a scam.
[01:23:00.438 --> 01:23:04.701]  Yeah, and what I've been saying, what I just mentioned to you about Chicago, nobody's talking about that.
[01:23:05.102 --> 01:23:09.205]  That is the most corrupt city in America, and look at the people running the show!
[01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:17.311]  You can't get closer than the Obamas and Clintons and Democrats, so when a Republican goes in there, you think they're gonna try to cut him out.
[01:23:17.411 --> 01:23:21.374]  Oh, by the way, remember the presidential race under Kennedy?
[01:23:21.814 --> 01:23:23.576]  And all of a sudden he wins Illinois?
[01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:27.108]  It's amazing.
[01:23:27.188 --> 01:23:33.670]  But instead of blaming their own corrupt government, it's fun to just go beat up some people that came out for free speech.
[01:23:33.710 --> 01:23:34.850]  And I was talking to folks that were there.
[01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:36.511]  A lot of them weren't even supporters.
[01:23:36.551 --> 01:23:39.132]  They just came to see what was going on, to hear for themselves.
[01:23:39.492 --> 01:23:40.852]  And here are people attacking them.
[01:23:41.372 --> 01:23:44.893]  What do you make of the mainstream media trying to legitimize arresting Trump?
[01:23:45.313 --> 01:23:48.254]  Are they not trying to set a precedent to really restrict free speech?
[01:23:48.294 --> 01:23:51.375]  I mean, I'm supporting Trump just out of free speech alone.
[01:23:52.346 --> 01:23:58.590]  Well again, you saw with the Republicans, I mean it's been out there in the open, they're trying to derail his campaign.
[01:23:58.810 --> 01:24:00.151]  He's not a member of the club.
[01:24:00.491 --> 01:24:03.333]  And then you look at who is this Republican club?
[01:24:03.633 --> 01:24:08.456]  They gotta bring out a little lightweight like Mittens Romney to come fight Trump?
[01:24:08.876 --> 01:24:10.637]  Look who the other Republicans are!
[01:24:11.117 --> 01:24:12.278]  Lindsey Graham?
[01:24:13.819 --> 01:24:14.920]  Mitch McConnell?
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:16.580]  Ryan?
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.761]  A bunch of little nobody nothings!
[01:24:19.582 --> 01:24:20.542]  John and St.
[01:24:20.562 --> 01:24:21.242]  McCain?
[01:24:21.743 --> 01:24:23.904]  So that's the Republican establishment?
[01:24:24.144 --> 01:24:32.267]  That's why Trump is fighting against no one, and they're going to do everything they can to bring him down, and of course the Democrats want to knock him out.
[01:24:32.747 --> 01:24:35.689]  Because he's the only real contender against them.
[01:24:36.249 --> 01:24:40.830]  Well, the Republicans are corrupt and bought and paid for, and the elite put weak leaders in so they can control them.
[01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:42.970]  They're scared of Trump because he is his own guy.
[01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:46.331]  And if the people elect him, you know, that's their issue.
[01:24:46.351 --> 01:24:48.752]  We need to keep him on a short leash if he does get elected.
[01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:51.472]  But I've never seen him hitting the panic button like this.
[01:24:51.512 --> 01:24:52.652]  But also look at Europe.
[01:24:53.113 --> 01:24:53.673]  Look at what else.
[01:24:54.233 --> 01:24:59.114]  I want to segue into the economy with you because, boy, you've been proven right with how this thing is starting to collapse.
[01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:02.895]  And I want to know how long you think they can cover up just how bad it's really gotten.
[01:25:02.935 --> 01:25:04.135]  But first, wow.
[01:25:05.154 --> 01:25:05.354]  U.N.
[01:25:05.394 --> 01:25:06.055]  rights expert.
[01:25:06.075 --> 01:25:08.336]  North Korea leader should be prosecuted.
[01:25:08.777 --> 01:25:10.158]  Another example of statism.
[01:25:10.198 --> 01:25:12.939]  Kim Jong-un threatening to blow up Seoul, South Korea with nukes.
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:14.280]  Threatening to blow up Manhattan.
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:15.641]  Threatening to attack Japan.
[01:25:15.881 --> 01:25:27.369]  The Russians, as you know, we'll put that up on screen for folks that just tuned in via TV or radio, that the Russians have, quote, threatened to invade if they don't stop threatening World War III.
[01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:37.257]  Almost no coverage of this in our media, and I wanted to get your inside baseball take on why the Russians are suddenly pulling out of Syria, saying it's the ceasefire.
[01:25:38.137 --> 01:25:40.099]  I think it's something much bigger and very ominous.
[01:25:40.119 --> 01:25:45.123]  I'm not quite sure what, but I'm telling you, my spidey sense has never been redlining like this.
[01:25:47.005 --> 01:25:55.828]  You know, I don't know why they're doing it, but I don't think they're going to do much of it, is my analysis, or look at what I've been reading.
[01:25:55.868 --> 01:25:58.188]  And again, I'm on the outside over here.
[01:25:58.608 --> 01:26:09.992]  I think what they're saying is that we have a peace process going on, they're still bombing away, but they're going to start bringing down their troop strength.
[01:26:10.552 --> 01:26:15.133]  And are they bringing it down because they're concerned about something else happening?
[01:26:15.634 --> 01:26:16.434]  Very likely.
[01:26:17.074 --> 01:26:29.301]  And with the North Korean situation, the other side of the story that's never told is the United States' aggression over there as well, continually threatening them with all these so-called war games.
[01:26:29.881 --> 01:26:33.583]  And if you put somebody in a corner, they're going to react the way they are.
[01:26:34.103 --> 01:26:38.065]  Again, you know, was it North Korea that invaded Libya?
[01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:40.327]  No, no, I know, they're the ones that overthrew Iraq.
[01:26:41.067 --> 01:26:43.796]  No, no, it was North Korea that went into Afghanistan.
[01:26:43.816 --> 01:26:44.538]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:26:44.879 --> 01:26:48.470]  No, it's North Korea that said Assad has to go.
[01:26:50.606 --> 01:26:51.507]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:26:52.227 --> 01:26:56.411]  So the United States militarism, you know, it's freaking these people out.
[01:26:56.691 --> 01:26:58.212]  They don't know if they're going to be next.
[01:26:58.272 --> 01:26:59.633]  So of course they're threatening them.
[01:26:59.873 --> 01:27:02.195]  You blow me up, I'm going to blow up Manhattan.
[01:27:02.655 --> 01:27:03.816]  Sure, and I misspoke earlier.
[01:27:03.836 --> 01:27:06.959]  What I was saying is Russia is threatening to invade North Korea.
[01:27:06.979 --> 01:27:09.200]  I mean, that is so unprecedented.
[01:27:09.541 --> 01:27:11.082]  Gerald, what do you make of that?
[01:27:11.142 --> 01:27:12.023]  That's what I was trying to get at.
[01:27:12.643 --> 01:27:14.864]  No, no, they're not going to Russia invade them.
[01:27:15.324 --> 01:27:22.286]  No, again, you know, Russia's saying is that, as what the Chinese are saying, is they want peace in this area.
[01:27:22.967 --> 01:27:34.731]  And then they could see, look at the United States, you listen to the generals, you listen to this Ashton Carter, you listen to all of them, and it's pivot to Asia, China's our great
[01:27:35.631 --> 01:27:40.514]  Absolutely, and now you've got China building these sandcastles, but it's not just the Western elite that's out of control.
[01:27:40.574 --> 01:27:41.934]  North Korea is out of control.
[01:27:42.315 --> 01:27:43.755]  China's doing some saber-rattling.
[01:27:44.155 --> 01:27:48.598]  Why would these governments suddenly all be going into a military mode?
[01:27:48.998 --> 01:27:53.900]  Why, historically, Gerald, when we see economic collapse globally, does it take us to war every time?
[01:27:54.140 --> 01:28:01.324]  Why are so many historians saying the climate is almost exactly like the beginning of World War I, and all it's going to take is the wrong spark?
[01:28:02.421 --> 01:28:05.924]  Because again, as you mentioned, the economies are collapsing.
[01:28:06.324 --> 01:28:08.546]  What happens when they devalue a currency?
[01:28:08.746 --> 01:28:10.447]  You keep hearing currency wars.
[01:28:10.967 --> 01:28:11.808]  So go back.
[01:28:11.848 --> 01:28:18.213]  You have a depression, a crash, a depression, currency wars, trade wars, world war.
[01:28:18.653 --> 01:28:20.314]  Look at the shipping indexes.
[01:28:20.614 --> 01:28:21.835]  They're at all-time lows.
[01:28:22.116 --> 01:28:23.477]  Where's the biggest failures?
[01:28:23.777 --> 01:28:24.918]  From Asia to Europe.
[01:28:25.538 --> 01:28:34.220]  So what's happening is everybody's fighting for a piece of the pie, devaluing their currencies, the currency wars, and by the way, that's not going to increase their trade.
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:38.121]  Global trade is down this year, last year, down almost 14%.
[01:28:40.262 --> 01:28:44.023]  Today, the retail numbers came out in the United States, down.
[01:28:44.423 --> 01:28:53.951]  Oh, and by the way, Alex, they also revised downward sharply from an increase of 0.6% in January.
[01:28:54.331 --> 01:29:01.557]  They've devalued it now to like a minus 0.4% in January, the retail sales.
[01:29:01.957 --> 01:29:08.022]  And then they have the audacity to say that we created 55,000 retail jobs in January and
[01:29:12.125 --> 01:29:17.127]  340,000 retail jobs last year as the retail sector is collapsing.
[01:29:17.388 --> 01:29:20.429]  So China's economy, you look at their debt bubble.
[01:29:20.789 --> 01:29:26.912]  It's gone from about $500 billion, with a B, 20 years ago, public and private debt.
[01:29:27.552 --> 01:29:29.613]  It's at $30 trillion now.
[01:29:29.633 --> 01:29:31.474]  $30 trillion.
[01:29:31.754 --> 01:29:33.615]  Look at their exports last month.
[01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:35.936]  They were down almost $25 billion.
[01:29:35.976 --> 01:29:36.916]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:29:37.096 --> 01:29:39.437]  Trends Research, TrendsResearch.com, Gerald Salente.
[01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:41.217]  I want to briefly ask you, then go right to calls.
[01:29:41.917 --> 01:29:50.519]  If the world collapse has already begun in many areas, when will it finally be more evident here, and how do you think we'll try to paper over it, and what's the next shoe to drop?
[01:29:50.619 --> 01:29:53.200]  Is there any way to reverse this downward spiral?
[01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:54.580]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:56.781]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:29:57.961 --> 01:29:58.861]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.362 --> 01:30:00.962]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:01.902 --> 01:30:04.583]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:08.849 --> 01:30:14.193]  In a rather bizarre statement, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has said that the U.S.
[01:30:14.233 --> 01:30:22.679]  didn't lose a single person in Libya, which is to say the former Secretary of State is ignoring the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
[01:30:22.999 --> 01:30:25.100]  Now, Libya is perfect, isn't it?
[01:30:25.241 --> 01:30:25.901]  Clinton said.
[01:30:26.281 --> 01:30:30.464]  Libya was a different kind of calculation, and we didn't lose a single person.
[01:30:30.724 --> 01:30:35.588]  We didn't have a problem in supporting our European and Arab allies in working with NATO.
[01:30:35.928 --> 01:30:44.712]  Mrs. Clinton conveniently skipped over the attack of September 11th, 2012 on the Diplomatic Special Mission Compound in CIA Annex in Benghazi.
[01:30:44.912 --> 01:30:53.235]  The left ambassador Christopher Stevens, foreign management officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Smith and Glenn Doherty dead.
[01:30:53.435 --> 01:30:56.056]  There's even a movie out about it called 13 Hours.
[01:30:56.496 --> 01:31:01.558]  And this isn't the first time Hillary has had a selective memory, but what difference does it make?
[01:31:01.838 --> 01:31:05.400]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:31:08.530 --> 01:31:11.732]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:12.052 --> 01:31:20.056]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:20.276 --> 01:31:25.299]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:25.699 --> 01:31:27.980]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:32:08.329 --> 01:32:14.711]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[01:32:15.111 --> 01:32:24.514]  We look at a product like Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[01:32:32.176 --> 01:32:33.978]  I needed a detox basically.
[01:32:34.298 --> 01:32:38.462]  I started taking X2 first for about seven days and then I did the deep cleanse.
[01:32:38.922 --> 01:32:42.385]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:32:42.585 --> 01:32:43.626]  What do you have to lose?
[01:32:43.906 --> 01:32:52.474]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[01:32:52.936 --> 01:32:56.739]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[01:32:56.759 --> 01:32:58.280]  I was like really more natural.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:03.604]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:33:23.914 --> 01:33:26.115]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:26.575 --> 01:33:31.798]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:33.599 --> 01:33:43.244]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've been working at InfoWarsLive.com, that's about three and a half years old now, for three years to bring the ultimate game-changing probiotic to you.
[01:33:45.999 --> 01:33:46.981]  We are almost there.
[01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:48.523]  We don't have that yet.
[01:33:48.704 --> 01:33:50.607]  But just there are a lot of great robotics out there.
[01:33:50.807 --> 01:33:52.049]  That's something you obviously need.
[01:33:52.971 --> 01:33:54.734]  And they run the gamut.
[01:33:56.287 --> 01:34:05.751]  It is very important to do the research, because here's a big story out of Bloomberg yesterday, and we're going to our guests and your calls, about how gut bacteria are shaking up cancer research.
[01:34:06.411 --> 01:34:21.318]  And it goes through Roach Holdings and all the other big pharma companies, genetic engineering companies, are saying at the University of Chicago, you name it, that the gut is dead, that kills your immune system, your body stops fighting cancer, you die.
[01:34:22.165 --> 01:34:26.788]  Now, this has been known since the time of Hippocrates, thousands of years ago.
[01:34:27.868 --> 01:34:29.089]  That health starts in the gut.
[01:34:30.190 --> 01:34:30.670]  To quote him.
[01:34:32.371 --> 01:34:36.213]  But another big part of that is true, pure iodine.
[01:34:36.554 --> 01:34:39.315]  Which, according to our research, no one else really even has.
[01:34:39.475 --> 01:34:42.417]  It's all different types that are bound and you don't really absorb.
[01:34:43.218 --> 01:34:48.821]  X2 is a pure form of iodine injected into organic palm oil in a patented process.
[01:34:49.301 --> 01:34:50.102]  A secret process.
[01:34:51.127 --> 01:34:54.129]  And believe me, big companies have called us, tried to buy it, tried to figure it out.
[01:34:54.170 --> 01:34:59.654]  It's a true blessing this fell into our hands about a year after we had our other iodine out that was the best at that time.
[01:35:01.115 --> 01:35:07.240]  And it was a similar process, we were just able to expand on it through Dr. Group's scientists.
[01:35:08.241 --> 01:35:11.563]  And everyone should be taking Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[01:35:13.425 --> 01:35:15.626]  Here's the article, The Thyroid Gut Connection.
[01:35:16.487 --> 01:35:19.890]  And you can read about that for yourself, just type in thyroid,
[01:35:21.503 --> 01:35:24.185]  Immune connection and there's all these scientific papers out there.
[01:35:24.486 --> 01:35:25.406]  Look at it for yourself.
[01:35:25.747 --> 01:35:26.848]  Here's Anthony Gucciardi.
[01:35:26.948 --> 01:35:32.713]  Four years ago, antibiotics could be to blame for skyrocketing mental illness rates.
[01:35:32.753 --> 01:35:33.493]  Gets into the gut.
[01:35:33.873 --> 01:35:34.814]  Gets into autism.
[01:35:35.135 --> 01:35:39.198]  All the stuff Wakefield said 20 years ago, then they demonized him and said he lied.
[01:35:39.418 --> 01:35:40.459]  He's since been exonerated.
[01:35:41.139 --> 01:35:42.461]  Well, now it's in Bloomberg.
[01:35:42.761 --> 01:35:43.802]  Now it's in the New York Times.
[01:35:45.043 --> 01:35:45.583]  Here's another one.
[01:35:45.623 --> 01:35:49.086]  McDonald's destroys the gut bacteria of a college kid in 10 days.
[01:35:49.106 --> 01:35:49.907]  They tested his
[01:35:53.759 --> 01:35:54.760]  Because you know what?
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:56.541]  Before and then after.
[01:35:56.601 --> 01:35:58.543]  Totally dead after 10 days.
[01:35:59.323 --> 01:35:59.904]  Tech Times.
[01:35:59.944 --> 01:36:02.186]  Researchers find link between gut bacteria and mental health.
[01:36:03.547 --> 01:36:07.831]  I'm just pointing out again, Huffington Post Science, the surprising link between gut bacteria and anxiety.
[01:36:08.331 --> 01:36:09.352]  It's all in your gut.
[01:36:09.392 --> 01:36:12.274]  Your brain and your gut are connected through nerves in the spine.
[01:36:12.735 --> 01:36:13.475]  It's known.
[01:36:13.495 --> 01:36:15.317]  That's why you always say, I go with my gut.
[01:36:15.717 --> 01:36:16.418]  I go with my gut.
[01:36:16.658 --> 01:36:17.378]  I go with my gut.
[01:36:17.959 --> 01:36:19.840]  That's where your brain actually communicates.
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:23.463]  That's your brain inside of you going, behave yourself, do what I tell you.
[01:36:24.312 --> 01:36:25.212]  That's the subconscious.
[01:36:25.653 --> 01:36:28.834]  It's a hundred times more powerful, something more than the conscious.
[01:36:29.174 --> 01:36:30.635]  The conscious is your limited focus.
[01:36:30.835 --> 01:36:32.716]  Your full brain power is your gut.
[01:36:33.176 --> 01:36:36.778]  That's your brain communicating a siren in your belly, folks.
[01:36:38.179 --> 01:36:43.201]  When my sixth sense goes off, it's in my gut, my heart, and right in my third eye, which is your pineal gland.
[01:36:43.221 --> 01:36:46.343]  It's just, it's like I'm, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's actually incredible because
[01:36:47.239 --> 01:36:49.020]  I can't stop thinking until I get the answer.
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:50.480]  And it's always accurate.
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:52.041]  We're amazing creatures, folks.
[01:36:52.341 --> 01:36:53.781]  Use the gifts God's given you.
[01:36:54.381 --> 01:36:57.302]  And from my research and what it's done for me, you want to turn your body back on.
[01:36:57.322 --> 01:36:59.203]  Your pineal, your thyroid, your gut.
[01:36:59.903 --> 01:37:00.303]  X2.
[01:37:00.603 --> 01:37:01.444]  Infowarsandlife.com.
[01:37:01.464 --> 01:37:04.965]  Now, I'm going to stop ranting about it, but it's important.
[01:37:05.445 --> 01:37:06.285]  Scientific American.
[01:37:06.325 --> 01:37:08.086]  Mental health may depend on creatures in the gut.
[01:37:08.966 --> 01:37:11.107]  How gut bacteria is shaking up cancer research.
[01:37:12.647 --> 01:37:14.268]  The thyroid-gut connection.
[01:37:15.612 --> 01:37:20.256]  I mean, just please, please, please, please get X2 today.
[01:37:20.296 --> 01:37:22.878]  Now, I'm going to warn you, a lot of folks get diarrhea after a week and a half.
[01:37:22.898 --> 01:37:26.321]  A lot of people get, like, detoxing after about three weeks.
[01:37:26.801 --> 01:37:30.184]  It's because, this is a big deal, folks, when your gut turns back on.
[01:37:30.204 --> 01:37:32.706]  And it's all right there in that thyroid.
[01:37:32.726 --> 01:37:37.550]  It's your brain, your thyroid, communicating through the nerves in your spine, into your stomach, into your gut.
[01:37:38.527 --> 01:37:40.748]  Well, when you get the willies or something, you know, you feel it in your gut.
[01:37:41.068 --> 01:37:42.108]  That's what it's like.
[01:37:42.188 --> 01:37:47.950]  It's your body releasing endorphins, releasing chemicals, releasing adrenaline.
[01:37:48.170 --> 01:37:48.970]  We're a machine.
[01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:49.590]  We're amazing.
[01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:53.531]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, a lot of other specials.
[01:37:53.551 --> 01:37:54.991]  The food special is running one more day.
[01:37:55.011 --> 01:37:56.472]  30 to 40% off.
[01:37:56.492 --> 01:37:57.552]  Take advantage of that as well.
[01:37:57.852 --> 01:37:58.832]  Now, I'm going to stop ranting.
[01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:01.273]  Now, you don't like to plug yourself, Gerald, and I apologize.
[01:38:01.293 --> 01:38:03.134]  I couldn't come to your great event up in New York.
[01:38:03.154 --> 01:38:04.014]  I've been dealing with a lot of
[01:38:04.674 --> 01:38:07.356]  Launch operations, family stuff, family illnesses.
[01:38:07.876 --> 01:38:10.037]  You know, it seems like things come in threes.
[01:38:10.097 --> 01:38:12.759]  All hell's been breaking loose for me the last year for good and bad.
[01:38:12.799 --> 01:38:15.420]  But your trends forecast is so incredible.
[01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:16.901]  Your news alerts are so amazing.
[01:38:17.322 --> 01:38:19.103]  How do folks sign up to get your magazine?
[01:38:19.143 --> 01:38:25.026]  Because even if they know stuff and think they know it all, I learn a lot of stuff from you.
[01:38:25.046 --> 01:38:29.549]  And it's also good to have the Trends Journal to give to people to hopefully wake them up as well.
[01:38:29.789 --> 01:38:30.990]  Gerald, how do folks subscribe to that?
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.661]  They could go to Trends Research.
[01:38:33.801 --> 01:38:35.342]  TrendsResearch.com.
[01:38:35.802 --> 01:38:42.846]  And of course, beyond the Trends Journal, which is a quarterly, and you see what it is, it's 54 pages, full color, no advertisements.
[01:38:43.386 --> 01:38:45.107]  We do a Trend Alerts each week.
[01:38:45.628 --> 01:38:47.008]  We have a Trends Monthly.
[01:38:47.028 --> 01:38:49.310]  That'll be going out next week, actually.
[01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:53.312]  And we also do Trends in the News broadcast each weekday night.
[01:38:53.872 --> 01:39:01.874]  So it is really, you know, in my humble estimation, the only place where you could read history before it happens, and we've been doing it since 1980.
[01:39:02.054 --> 01:39:10.917]  And let me explain, people need to also invest time and money in the Liberty Movement, all flavors of free expression and openness.
[01:39:11.257 --> 01:39:15.838]  That's how we build the new economy, is with our actions, something you've been writing about for 30 years.
[01:39:17.048 --> 01:39:21.291]  Yes, and it is very important that people, you know, support the people that they believe in.
[01:39:21.311 --> 01:39:23.593]  You know, it's not going to happen.
[01:39:23.613 --> 01:39:30.378]  We talk about, you know, move on and all these other things that are funded by the, you know, the multi-billionaires.
[01:39:31.118 --> 01:39:36.722]  And if we, the people, don't make it happen and support each other, then we could see the future.
[01:39:36.802 --> 01:39:38.443]  They're going to be theirs, not ours.
[01:39:38.824 --> 01:39:41.526]  I like, you know, I'm very pro-probiotic, by the way.
[01:39:41.546 --> 01:39:45.769]  And I don't know if you know this, but this was the first book that I worked on.
[01:39:46.429 --> 01:39:47.289]  Natural healing.
[01:39:47.469 --> 01:39:49.290]  Wasn't that like a number one New York Times bestseller?
[01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:52.391]  Not this one, but another one very soon.
[01:39:52.411 --> 01:39:53.551]  This was a Warner book.
[01:39:53.831 --> 01:39:55.012]  It was a big book, 1988.
[01:39:56.112 --> 01:40:13.258]  And I also have an honorary doctorate of law from the National University of Health Sciences for the work that I've done over the years in integrative and complementary medicine and putting out the information about it.
[01:40:14.358 --> 01:40:16.362]  No, I know you wrote about gut flora 30 years ago.
[01:40:16.422 --> 01:40:23.254]  How big a deal is it that now the top scientists are saying, we didn't know this, it's incredible, it's incredible, this could reduce cancer by 80%.
[01:40:23.314 --> 01:40:25.217]  I mean, that's in the news now.
[01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:35.318]  Well, what I'm also saying is that this is one of the great big trends that we're looking at in the whole element of what the products that you put out there.
[01:40:35.839 --> 01:40:38.902]  Whole health healing is the only way out.
[01:40:39.362 --> 01:40:46.068]  As we see it, there's not one drug on the market that cures a chronic degenerative disease.
[01:40:46.588 --> 01:40:48.650]  All they do is mask the symptoms.
[01:40:48.971 --> 01:40:50.011]  They don't cure you.
[01:40:50.692 --> 01:40:56.197]  Yes, you know, if I got bit by a tick a couple of times, yeah, I go for those antibiotics.
[01:40:56.638 --> 01:40:58.779]  But then I also go for the probiotics.
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:04.305]  And I do other things to heal myself and to build my system back up in a natural way.
[01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:06.406]  So I'm not saying I'm anti-drug.
[01:41:06.747 --> 01:41:07.608]  They have their place.
[01:41:07.648 --> 01:41:08.528]  Sure there's a balance.
[01:41:09.409 --> 01:41:11.231]  Exactly, but not in whole health feelings.
[01:41:11.271 --> 01:41:18.616]  So what I'm saying is that the people listening in to really pay attention to what you're saying in the whole context of it.
[01:41:19.016 --> 01:41:24.901]  You know, one of our top trends for 2016 is, you know, the baby boomers might be one of them.
[01:41:25.241 --> 01:41:30.285]  You know, we're hitting 70 this year and we don't want to end up as inmates in nursing homes.
[01:41:31.005 --> 01:41:36.308]  So you want to stay healthy until the lights go out, basically.
[01:41:36.588 --> 01:41:44.893]  So I'm urging people to really consider listening to what you're saying, the products that you have available, because it's going to help them.
[01:41:44.933 --> 01:41:55.559]  Because the only way that I see this movement moving forward that we're interested in, and that is truth of life and peace and prosperity, is
[01:41:57.060 --> 01:42:04.448]  That we have to be in the best shape we can physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[01:42:04.468 --> 01:42:07.992]  And I'm not talking religiously, I'm talking about the truth within yourself.
[01:42:08.472 --> 01:42:13.057]  So I'm just saying this because it's very important that people... We have to get healthy, we have to get strong.
[01:42:13.197 --> 01:42:18.481]  And for some of us who got out of shape, it's a long journey, but you get there and it's life-changing, great points.
[01:42:18.761 --> 01:42:21.563]  Gerald Solente is our guest, TrendsResearch.com.
[01:42:21.583 --> 01:42:25.926]  Let's start going to your calls, George, Daniel, Dave, John, Mr. X, and many others.
[01:42:26.267 --> 01:42:28.208]  Toll-free number to join us after callers hang up, 800-259-9231.
[01:42:28.228 --> 01:42:28.288]  800-259-9231.
[01:42:28.328 --> 01:42:29.769]  Let's go to Connecticut first.
[01:42:29.789 --> 01:42:31.831]  Let's talk to George in Connecticut.
[01:42:31.851 --> 01:42:33.432]  You're on the air with Gerald Solente.
[01:42:39.730 --> 01:42:43.552]  Hi Gerald, it was nice being up at that demonstration in Kingston, the beautiful town.
[01:42:43.572 --> 01:42:48.355]  Yeah, that guy was a jerk, buddy, but maybe we can put that in our past.
[01:42:48.735 --> 01:42:58.200]  Anyway, my question is, do you see any trends leading to maybe people finally getting up and stopping the corruption, whether state, local, or federal?
[01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:01.502]  Yes, clearly there's massive, and instead I want you to follow up, but clearly Gerald,
[01:43:02.122 --> 01:43:06.687]  What are other manifestations of the populist awakening all over the world going to be?
[01:43:07.148 --> 01:43:11.493]  Investigative journalism, lawsuits, people voting with their dollars, we see it all.
[01:43:11.954 --> 01:43:17.080]  Is it the discovery of the power we really have or what are other manifestations you're looking for?
[01:43:17.762 --> 01:43:19.344]  Well again, you know, it depends where you are.
[01:43:19.384 --> 01:43:22.407]  Look what just happened in Germany over the past week, Sunday.
[01:43:22.968 --> 01:43:28.234]  The AFD party, you know, got the biggest rise it ever has since the end of World War II.
[01:43:28.595 --> 01:43:29.756]  What are their stances?
[01:43:30.437 --> 01:43:31.458]  Anti-immigration and
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.401]  Pulling out of the Eurozone.
[01:43:36.421 --> 01:43:40.623]  And again, like him or dislike him, I'm not taking a stand on either of them.
[01:43:41.283 --> 01:43:43.584]  Why are people following Bernie Sanders?
[01:43:44.285 --> 01:43:49.047]  Because he's, well besides, you're gonna get a free college tuition?
[01:43:50.207 --> 01:43:56.930]  Besides that rap, he's going after the Wall Street gang, just as Trump is doing on another end.
[01:43:57.330 --> 01:43:58.610]  The people are ready.
[01:43:58.630 --> 01:44:01.672]  They're ready to move, as I see it,
[01:44:02.412 --> 01:44:09.894]  We need a unified movement without a political overtone to it to push us forward.
[01:44:10.254 --> 01:44:11.254]  The people are ready.
[01:44:11.594 --> 01:44:14.375]  You can see it by the crowds turning out.
[01:44:14.735 --> 01:44:23.917]  Look at the increase, for example, on the Republican end of the amount of people going and voting on primaries.
[01:44:23.977 --> 01:44:27.738]  And then they claim that he's a divider when he's growing the party more than Reagan did.
[01:44:28.478 --> 01:44:29.039]  It's like, what, like 40%?
[01:44:31.084 --> 01:44:34.827]  You know, and again, you're seeing go around the world.
[01:44:35.187 --> 01:44:36.608]  You're seeing it happen.
[01:44:36.908 --> 01:44:38.850]  The people want to live in peace.
[01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:40.731]  They don't want this stuff.
[01:44:41.491 --> 01:44:47.296]  And so what I'm saying is we need a unified movement, as I see it, to bring us all together.
[01:44:47.596 --> 01:44:51.619]  And not a movement, but a movement with directions, focus.
[01:44:52.219 --> 01:44:53.661]  Well, exactly.
[01:44:53.761 --> 01:45:00.090]  I see it as an anti-globalist movement where the globalists can't be tax-exempt offshore and then reap the rewards of this country.
[01:45:00.931 --> 01:45:03.474]  Because look at Jean-Claude Van Damme coming out against globalism.
[01:45:03.794 --> 01:45:05.337]  Le Pen coming out against globalism.
[01:45:05.757 --> 01:45:08.861]  Even the Liberal Mayor of London coming out against globalism in the EU.
[01:45:09.882 --> 01:45:21.535]  Anti-globalism is getting, which is really anti-neo-colonialism, it's like the corporations are now conquering the countries, and they're conquering the old world and the new world, and as people wake up to that paradigm, it's game over.
[01:45:21.876 --> 01:45:25.760]  George in Connecticut, you're on the air with Gerald Cilente, go ahead, finish up your point.
[01:45:27.102 --> 01:45:31.124]  Well, I have a specific reason for that because I've dealt with that myself.
[01:45:31.184 --> 01:45:36.887]  I've tried to help people locally against a major billionaire project.
[01:45:37.428 --> 01:45:44.331]  And what happened was they used the police to come after me and threaten the life of my wife and myself and anybody that got into it.
[01:45:44.372 --> 01:45:46.893]  I'm talking serious death threats.
[01:45:47.273 --> 01:45:47.814]  Well that's certainly...
[01:46:03.528 --> 01:46:18.000]  Democratic Party areas, and I'm not saying the Republicans are perfect, they're very corrupt, but with Democrats, from my research, on average, they're more the Chicago, New York, big city crime machine, and that's where I see the police actually operating, at least certain divisions of them.
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:23.724]  They've got corrupt nest, usually at the top, that will actually engage in organized crime activities.
[01:46:24.204 --> 01:46:24.845]  That's well known.
[01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:26.806]  Gerald, is that an oversimplification?
[01:46:26.827 --> 01:46:31.710]  Because, you know, it's kind of like Republicans tend to get caught cheating with a guy on their wife, and then
[01:46:32.951 --> 01:46:35.794]  And then with Democrats, it seems to always be heterosexual.
[01:46:35.814 --> 01:46:37.096]  It's just weird trends.
[01:46:37.716 --> 01:46:42.061]  But it does seem Democrats are more of the old big city machine crime stuff.
[01:46:42.081 --> 01:46:44.723]  Is that an accurate statement or an oversimplification?
[01:46:44.844 --> 01:46:47.086]  I think it's where you come from, you know.
[01:46:47.126 --> 01:46:54.514]  And again, to me, the Democrats and the Republicans, and I don't say this facetiously, are no different than the Bloods and the Crips.
[01:46:55.094 --> 01:47:03.101]  I mean, how many more people do they have to murder around the world in the name of bringing freedom and democracy?
[01:47:03.401 --> 01:47:07.944]  Oh, and a humanitarian mission like our Nobel Peace Prize winner did.
[01:47:08.085 --> 01:47:18.253]  And how much more of our dough do they have to steal in the names of too big to fails, talk bailouts, loan guarantees, tax breaks, and all the others.
[01:47:18.273 --> 01:47:20.855]  So, they're just different branches to me.
[01:47:22.256 --> 01:47:25.520]  Of the same corrupt Luds in the Crips.
[01:47:27.783 --> 01:47:34.851]  Well, I just said we should just start giving him Nobel Prizes on a daily basis every time he bombs another country because this is their attempted inversion of reality.
[01:47:34.891 --> 01:47:35.512]  Thank you, George.
[01:47:35.972 --> 01:47:37.274]  Daniel in California.
[01:47:37.294 --> 01:47:38.455]  You're on the air with Gerald Solente.
[01:47:38.475 --> 01:47:38.716]  Go ahead.
[01:47:40.106 --> 01:47:41.527]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:47:42.108 --> 01:47:54.196]  My question to you is regarding the whole anonymous thing recently in the news just like came out that they're on a full-on attack again on Donald Trump and wanted to know what your views of anonymous are and who like funds them and everything.
[01:47:54.216 --> 01:47:55.337]  Do you want Gerald's or mine?
[01:47:56.323 --> 01:47:56.824]  Or both.
[01:47:57.024 --> 01:47:58.345]  Gerald, give us your view.
[01:47:58.986 --> 01:48:03.131]  Well again, as I said, they're going to do anything they can to stop Trump.
[01:48:03.391 --> 01:48:04.773]  They've made it very clear.
[01:48:05.093 --> 01:48:15.364]  Again, how could you play such a weak card by bringing out Mitt Romney, a total little loser, to attack Trump?
[01:48:15.925 --> 01:48:18.367]  They have nobody there.
[01:48:19.127 --> 01:48:21.008]  What you see is what it is.
[01:48:21.088 --> 01:48:22.149]  They're desperate.
[01:48:22.409 --> 01:48:23.830]  They will try anything.
[01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:25.231]  Who's going to stop Trump?
[01:48:25.571 --> 01:48:26.491]  Mitch McConnell?
[01:48:26.832 --> 01:48:27.912]  Lindsey Graham?
[01:48:27.932 --> 01:48:29.954]  I mean, who?
[01:48:29.994 --> 01:48:31.414]  So of course they're doing this.
[01:48:31.434 --> 01:48:33.075]  They're going to do everything they can.
[01:48:33.136 --> 01:48:38.439]  By the way, I see Donald Trump not as a Republican candidate.
[01:48:39.739 --> 01:48:46.240]  I see him as a third party candidate that moved into the Republican Party to pull off what he wanted to do.
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:49.821]  And by the way, that's how he sees himself, just so folks know.
[01:48:49.841 --> 01:48:51.261]  A little inside baseball.
[01:48:52.381 --> 01:48:53.262]  Good, good point.
[01:48:53.682 --> 01:48:54.702]  Daniel, anything else?
[01:48:55.862 --> 01:49:04.544]  Well, I was just wondering, I know, like, if Trump were to ever not, like, get the Republican, let's say, primary, do you think he would go third party?
[01:49:04.564 --> 01:49:05.884]  Or what would you think?
[01:49:06.388 --> 01:49:08.893]  You know, I think he's thinking about it, but he doesn't want to give it to Hillary.
[01:49:08.933 --> 01:49:12.299]  I want to get Gerald's take on that, but getting back to Anonymous.
[01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:14.343]  My problem with Anonymous is this.
[01:49:15.552 --> 01:49:17.893]  Most of the anonymous people are good folks, but it's anonymous.
[01:49:18.073 --> 01:49:23.576]  Any group can just take the name anonymous, and then it's as if they speak as if they're a good organization.
[01:49:24.117 --> 01:49:27.038]  When you look at who is anonymous, it's not anonymous when it comes to Trump.
[01:49:27.399 --> 01:49:32.041]  It's Soros, it's Saudi Arabia, it's the Chinese Communist, it's the Pope.
[01:49:32.601 --> 01:49:35.943]  I mean, look at all these foreign groups lecturing us, Gerald.
[01:49:36.263 --> 01:49:37.964]  Why do you think they're lecturing us so much?
[01:49:38.004 --> 01:49:44.228]  I mean, don't they know that's backfiring, or is that just part of the hubris, and they think America's still in a catatonic state?
[01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:47.291]  It's part of the hubris, that's all it is.
[01:49:47.471 --> 01:49:49.232]  And who are they to tell us what to do?
[01:49:49.792 --> 01:49:56.056]  There's Tony Blair coming out and saying how bad it would be if Trump or Sanders, he mentioned both of them.
[01:49:56.336 --> 01:49:59.738]  Who's this little war criminal shooting his mouth off?
[01:49:59.798 --> 01:50:00.819]  Mind your own business!
[01:50:01.179 --> 01:50:08.143]  And oh, by the way, it's not only Saudi Arabia, they're coming out of Kuwait, they're coming out of Dubai, all of them are all coming out against Trump.
[01:50:08.543 --> 01:50:11.244]  What is he going to do, upset the military-industrial complex?
[01:50:11.324 --> 01:50:11.865]  I don't know.
[01:50:12.245 --> 01:50:13.966]  But what business is it of theirs?
[01:50:14.486 --> 01:50:17.388]  How dare they tell us, mine your own business!
[01:50:17.428 --> 01:50:18.688]  Could you handle that one?
[01:50:19.009 --> 01:50:23.811]  And again on the same, in the reverse, we should mine our own business in other countries.
[01:50:23.831 --> 01:50:30.555]  Well that's what you've always said, and that's part of globalism, is it gets to where we are so controlled by foreign countries and their elites.
[01:50:31.255 --> 01:50:39.580]  And basically the elites of the world, China, the US, Europe, pass their populations around, you know, like a hooker you use in a snuff film.
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:42.181]  I mean, it's not like they're just passing us around.
[01:50:42.221 --> 01:50:42.901]  They're hurting us.
[01:50:42.921 --> 01:50:45.863]  They're putting cigarettes out on us, if you want to use that allegory.
[01:50:46.143 --> 01:50:47.084]  Great points, Daniel.
[01:50:47.384 --> 01:50:50.145]  We'll talk to John, Dave, Mr. X, Mark, and others.
[01:50:50.525 --> 01:50:52.126]  Straight ahead, we're Gerald Cilente.

[01:51:02.192 --> 01:51:03.752]  And by the way, they hate our websites.
[01:51:03.772 --> 01:51:06.474]  They're doing everything they can to shut them down, so spread the word.
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:09.961]  Are you prepared to bug out?

[01:52:08.058 --> 01:52:11.543]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:52:12.284 --> 01:52:12.805]  It's true.
[01:52:12.925 --> 01:52:16.871]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:52:17.071 --> 01:52:18.934]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[01:54:21.054 --> 01:54:22.094]  It's coming down at midnight.

[01:55:04.426 --> 01:55:05.066]  Unprecedented.
[01:55:05.406 --> 01:55:06.247]  It's just good to have.
[01:55:06.307 --> 01:55:07.347]  I'm not saying you're going to need it.
[01:55:07.688 --> 01:55:08.448]  I hope you don't need it.
[01:55:08.468 --> 01:55:13.291]  But now more than ever, I've been getting prepared because the system doesn't want us to be self-sufficient.
[01:55:13.331 --> 01:55:15.012]  They want us to be totally dependent.
[01:55:15.312 --> 01:55:17.673]  Let's see who's been holding the longest here.
[01:55:19.054 --> 01:55:20.655]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[01:55:23.422 --> 01:55:25.626]  Let's just go to Mr. X in FEMA Region 6.
[01:55:26.067 --> 01:55:27.189]  I guess that might be Texas.
[01:55:29.133 --> 01:55:30.335]  What is the 25th Amendment?
[01:55:31.257 --> 01:55:32.620]  I forget some of those higher amendments.
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:34.483]  What's your question or point, Mr. X?
[01:55:36.721 --> 01:55:39.462]  Thank you gentlemen and gang and team and all that good jazz.
[01:55:39.502 --> 01:55:41.722]  Everybody keep just doing the hard work that you're doing.
[01:55:41.742 --> 01:55:42.442]  Stay awake.
[01:55:42.823 --> 01:55:44.303]  Stay focused.
[01:55:44.323 --> 01:55:45.343]  25th Amendment question.
[01:55:45.763 --> 01:56:02.547]  At what level degree, at how many people, what extent upon millions, hundreds of millions of people, do we know this organized gang of criminals and nothing but corrupt system is going to have to kill to say that we obviously have a corrupt leader to say that he's not sane.
[01:56:03.579 --> 01:56:13.304]  It's obviously come out in the news as well by several psychiatrists stating that this guy has got several issues that are just way off whack to say how can he be in charge of so many people.
[01:56:13.584 --> 01:56:14.424]  Sure, I got your question.
[01:56:14.444 --> 01:56:15.285]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:15.305 --> 01:56:21.548]  Of course, the 25th Amendment was passed in July of 65, ratified in 67.
[01:56:21.968 --> 01:56:24.690]  The 25th Amendment changed a portion of Article 2, Section 1.
[01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:31.113]  Section 1, in case of the removal of the president from office or his death or resignation, the vice president shall become president.
[01:56:31.813 --> 01:56:33.853]  And before, they had a different way of doing that.
[01:56:34.594 --> 01:56:39.994]  So I guess the caller was getting into, why can't we remove President Obama?
[01:56:40.895 --> 01:56:41.895]  I shouldn't have hung up on the caller.
[01:56:41.935 --> 01:56:43.475]  He was just so excited, I couldn't understand him.
[01:56:43.795 --> 01:56:46.276]  I'm not sure what he was getting at there about the 25th Amendment.
[01:56:47.096 --> 01:56:52.177]  But I don't want Obama to ever get shot or hurt because it'll turn him into a martyr.
[01:56:52.657 --> 01:56:53.657]  God forbid that happened.
[01:56:53.677 --> 01:56:56.437]  But at the same time, look how bad his vice president is.
[01:56:56.457 --> 01:56:59.938]  Where do you think he was going with that, Gerald Salente?
[01:57:00.478 --> 01:57:03.579]  Well, I think he was saying, you know, Obama's out of his mind and he should go.
[01:57:03.599 --> 01:57:06.941]  And I think they're all out of their mind.
[01:57:06.961 --> 01:57:09.181]  They're a bunch of psychopaths and sociopaths.
[01:57:09.522 --> 01:57:11.062]  By their deeds, you shall know them.
[01:57:13.277 --> 01:57:14.698]  I'm really good at killing people.
[01:57:15.058 --> 01:57:18.540]  That's what he was quoted as saying with his drone strikes.
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:19.920]  He never denied it.
[01:57:20.001 --> 01:57:20.621]  It's in a book.
[01:57:21.181 --> 01:57:24.383]  So to me, if somebody said that, I'd call the guy a psychopath.
[01:57:24.543 --> 01:57:25.223]  Absolutely.
[01:57:25.683 --> 01:57:26.924]  And then there's Hillary Clinton.
[01:57:26.944 --> 01:57:29.566]  You know, that famous one, we came, we saw, he died.
[01:57:29.886 --> 01:57:30.366]  Hee hee hee.
[01:57:30.606 --> 01:57:32.547]  How happy she was when she heard he died.
[01:57:32.567 --> 01:57:35.589]  These are like villains out of a science fiction movie.
[01:57:35.609 --> 01:57:37.149]  Let's talk to Bill in Ohio.
[01:57:37.169 --> 01:57:38.290]  We've got about a minute and a half, Bill.
[01:57:38.730 --> 01:57:39.811]  What's your point for Gerald Cilenti?
[01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:44.041]  Hey guys, I appreciate you, um, taking my call.
[01:57:44.361 --> 01:57:45.922]  Hey, uh, it's kind of a comment.
[01:57:45.982 --> 01:57:47.143]  I wanted your opinion.
[01:57:47.543 --> 01:57:49.764]  Uh, and Alex, I wanted to thank you a while back.
[01:57:50.044 --> 01:57:56.087]  I, I am the guy who did the Marine veteran and friends confront Hillary at book signing.
[01:57:57.047 --> 01:58:00.189]  Uh, you guys played it on your show and the hits have gotten crazy.
[01:58:00.609 --> 01:58:02.030]  The reason why I did that.
[01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.850]  Yeah.
[01:58:02.890 --> 01:58:03.771]  And I appreciate it.
[01:58:04.031 --> 01:58:10.394]  Uh, the reason why I did that was to show people that you could confront her in a respectful way.
[01:58:11.178 --> 01:58:13.160]  You were not going to get thrown out.
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:20.126]  I'm a Marine, and it just was suited to my DNA, and thank God you really got me down on Earth.
[01:58:20.526 --> 01:58:31.056]  Anyway, my comment is this, guys, is I think what we've done is if people would educate people how to, and that's the reason why I did the video, was to have to
[01:58:32.242 --> 01:58:35.144]  It's your point of call to get more out of this.
[01:58:35.324 --> 01:58:35.704]  Exactly.
[01:58:35.764 --> 01:58:38.306]  Don't do like Black Lives Matter and go stop people's events.
[01:58:38.726 --> 01:58:40.788]  Go to the events when they take questions or whatever.
[01:58:41.128 --> 01:58:43.210]  Get in there and expose what's happening.
[01:58:43.530 --> 01:58:45.731]  And if enough of us do that, it'll bring the system down.
[01:58:46.011 --> 01:58:47.132]  It's on the edge already.
[01:58:47.592 --> 01:58:48.013]  We'll be back.
[01:58:48.033 --> 01:58:49.894]  We'll be back in five more minutes with our guest.
[01:58:49.954 --> 01:58:52.956]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:52.996 --> 01:58:54.617]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:58.376 --> 01:59:02.737]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male, and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[01:59:03.017 --> 01:59:07.638]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:59:07.778 --> 01:59:08.798]  Talk about the effects.
[01:59:09.118 --> 01:59:10.599]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:59:10.619 --> 01:59:12.219]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:59:12.539 --> 01:59:13.599]  I feel like I look better.
[01:59:13.659 --> 01:59:14.299]  I feel better.
[01:59:14.379 --> 01:59:15.460]  I feel sexier.
[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:16.180]  I love it.
[01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:19.320]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.

[01:59:50.190 --> 01:59:51.611]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:16.328 --> 02:00:17.789]  There's an echo in here.
[02:00:18.290 --> 02:00:19.091]  Moving quick here.
[02:00:19.111 --> 02:00:27.199]  We're going to go into the next segment and continue taking your phone calls and covering a bunch of news that's breaking, like these two articles.
[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:31.603]  Trump first and only candidate to qualify as GOP nominee.
[02:00:31.683 --> 02:00:34.506]  Trump meets delegate threshold for GOP's Rule 40.
[02:00:35.868 --> 02:00:38.530]  They're talking about, that's a certain threshold to even be considered.
[02:00:39.391 --> 02:00:45.015]  They're talking about taking people that don't qualify under Rule 40 and letting them come and take the primary from them.
[02:00:45.035 --> 02:00:46.936]  That's in another article by Kurt Nimmo.
[02:00:47.156 --> 02:00:49.838]  RNC says delegates not bound to primary votes.
[02:00:50.178 --> 02:00:52.740]  We already knew that, but they're openly saying they're getting ready to steal it.
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:55.302]  And nobody's done an article on this that I could see.
[02:00:55.342 --> 02:00:56.383]  It was buried in an article.
[02:00:57.532 --> 02:01:01.754]  Federal Reserve gives money to Hillary, Cruz, and nothing to Trump.
[02:01:02.115 --> 02:01:06.477]  That is another huge populist endorsement against the private foreign banking cartel.
[02:01:06.977 --> 02:01:07.898]  Certainly it is for me.
[02:01:07.918 --> 02:01:11.740]  You know, there are articles like, Federal Reserve official under fire for donating to Hillary.
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:16.843]  There's other articles mentioning who the Federal Reserve gave to and who their employee union gave to.
[02:01:17.283 --> 02:01:21.425]  It's the employee union, but the union directs where it goes, from the top people.
[02:01:21.725 --> 02:01:23.426]  And that was again to Hillary, none to Trump.
[02:01:24.267 --> 02:01:26.688]  That tells me everything I need to know, Gerald Cilenti.
[02:01:28.134 --> 02:01:30.495]  Well, you know, you talk about the Federal Reserve.
[02:01:30.535 --> 02:01:31.135]  I don't know.
[02:01:31.815 --> 02:01:33.696]  This came out last week.
[02:01:34.316 --> 02:01:42.539]  Fed President Dick Fisher admitted, quote, the Fed front loaded an enormous market rally in order to create a wealth effect.
[02:01:42.919 --> 02:01:54.042]  He said that a few months ago at the anniversary of when they began this scheme of quantitative easing and zero interest rate policy just a week and a half ago.
[02:01:54.642 --> 02:01:56.503]  He told CNBC, quote,
[02:01:58.362 --> 02:02:07.285]  We injected cocaine and heroin into the system to enable this wealth effect that he admits didn't work.
[02:02:07.885 --> 02:02:12.426]  And he says, quote, now we are maintaining it with Ritalin.
[02:02:13.407 --> 02:02:21.429]  An official also confirmed that the quote, the Fed is a giant weapon that has no ammunition left.
[02:02:22.458 --> 02:02:29.741]  So in thinking about the Federal Reserve and using those words, heroin and cocaine, isn't that illegal?
[02:02:30.601 --> 02:02:31.942]  Heroin and cocaine?
[02:02:32.282 --> 02:02:33.742]  And that's all this was.
[02:02:34.403 --> 02:02:41.765]  It's, it's injections, heroin and cocaine injections to keep the money junkies alive.
[02:02:41.785 --> 02:02:44.847]  And by the way, the Federal Reserve's been caught, I remember the AP when I was first on there in 96.
[02:02:47.028 --> 02:02:51.872]  The Texas Fed and San Antonio got caught with multi-billions in cocaine money in it.
[02:02:52.352 --> 02:02:58.437]  So they also launder the money physically, but then also have the allegory of injecting us with heroin and cocaine.
[02:02:59.178 --> 02:03:04.142]  So is it any surprise that they're backing the people that support them, that created?
[02:03:04.803 --> 02:03:11.709]  I mean, look what the Clinton administration's did for the Federal Reserve and the whole banking system.
[02:03:12.029 --> 02:03:13.851]  You remember that, wasn't it?
[02:03:13.931 --> 02:03:14.271]  It's amazing.
[02:03:14.491 --> 02:03:15.111]  It's amazing.
[02:03:15.232 --> 02:03:25.538]  Ron Paul really should, and I get he's a purist, he should really come out as a populist, just as an anti-establishment move for Trump, and then I guarantee you Trump would adopt a lot of his policies.
[02:03:25.618 --> 02:03:27.440]  I know he admires Ron Paul.
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:30.462]  I know that when Rand attacked, who I also like,
[02:03:30.902 --> 02:03:33.363]  With you guys having shows like you have, with Mr. Soros, Stone's Own, and your show,
[02:03:55.774 --> 02:04:04.856]  Why couldn't Trump, you know, using the media like he's got, refer to his website where he can have us go to that?
[02:04:04.916 --> 02:04:08.297]  I mean, sure, there's just millions of folks that just use mainstream media.
[02:04:08.317 --> 02:04:08.697]  Well, sure.
[02:04:08.777 --> 02:04:17.260]  Trump sends out links and stuff on his Twitter to tens of millions, and he's come on the show and others, and he is using a lot of, you know, alternative media, new media.
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:18.060]  He is doing that.
[02:04:19.653 --> 02:04:26.462]  Trump's getting more hardcore as he goes, and he isn't fully on board with our ideas, but clearly he's got the system upset.
[02:04:26.502 --> 02:04:27.283]  I appreciate your call.
[02:04:27.563 --> 02:04:29.586]  Closing comment on that, Gerald Cilente.
[02:04:30.478 --> 02:04:36.521]  Oh yes he does, and again, this shows you the opportunity for a new direction.
[02:04:36.621 --> 02:04:41.544]  And to me, by the way, the only way it's really going to happen is with a new third party.
[02:04:42.064 --> 02:04:50.889]  Again, you put more of the same as the, again, and Trump I think is that third party candidate, and possibly something could happen from it.
[02:04:51.129 --> 02:04:55.812]  But to me, the Republicans and Democrats, I've had enough of them for the rest of my life.
[02:04:55.832 --> 02:04:57.573]  Do you think he's in danger of being assassinated?
[02:04:58.333 --> 02:04:58.974]  Absolutely.
[02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:07.887]  I think more than Lincoln or Kennedy, anybody, I think, well, I tell you, he better... Because the media keeps bringing up, you know, this whole hate thing that they keep doing.
[02:05:07.907 --> 02:05:08.487]  They're pushing it.
[02:05:08.507 --> 02:05:09.368]  Good point.
[02:05:09.388 --> 02:05:20.437]  A 7-Eleven shopper in Washington State relied on his concealed carry firearm over the weekend to subdue a man who attacked customers and staff with a small axe just before 6 a.m.
[02:05:20.497 --> 02:05:20.858]  Sunday.
[02:05:21.238 --> 02:05:31.626]  A masked man entered a convenience store in Seattle and began swinging a hatchet at both customers and the store clerk before attacking the cashier, reports KOMO News.
[02:05:32.347 --> 02:05:39.613]  We don't know if the intent was to commit a robbery because the suspect didn't say anything, a King County Sheriff's Sergeant said.
[02:05:40.093 --> 02:05:46.258]  An armed store patron was sitting and having coffee at the exact moment the axe-wielding suspect entered.
[02:05:46.838 --> 02:05:55.004]  The 60-year-old man, who has reportedly visited the store nearly every day for the past 12 years, shot and killed the suspect.
[02:05:55.524 --> 02:06:01.329]  The store clerk, age 58, suffered a minor injury to his stomach and is expected to recover.
[02:06:01.869 --> 02:06:05.732]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[02:06:08.396 --> 02:06:11.598]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:06:11.918 --> 02:06:19.922]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[02:06:41.050 --> 02:06:44.973]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[02:06:45.114 --> 02:06:49.737]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.

[02:07:08.212 --> 02:07:11.213]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:07:11.413 --> 02:07:13.574]  Deep Cleanse by InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:07:13.755 --> 02:07:20.477]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[02:07:44.392 --> 02:07:51.298]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spike G-Rex herbal processing technique.

[02:07:57.143 --> 02:07:59.744]  I know you're busy, but now here's a surprise.
[02:08:27.188 --> 02:08:30.770]  I know that you have, cause there's magic in my eyes.
[02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:35.852]  I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles.
[02:08:52.925 --> 02:09:01.151]  You know, Sunday I played a Paul Joseph Watson video that I said is the model of how to expose tyranny.
[02:09:01.951 --> 02:09:10.357]  I said it's pretty much better than anything I've done and just in content and how he lays it out is about as hardcore as it gets.
[02:09:11.357 --> 02:09:14.039]  Just straight clean facts, devastating.
[02:09:16.656 --> 02:09:22.799]  Jakari Jackson does some one-minute news vignettes that are as strong.
[02:09:22.839 --> 02:09:24.640]  In fact, I just brainstorm up here on air.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.762]  That's why I say a lot of my ideas on air because I don't ever have time to say it off air.
[02:09:29.039 --> 02:09:32.662]  Jokari does such great reports, but when he does those one minutes, they're so hard-hitting.
[02:09:33.102 --> 02:09:51.576]  That's what I think Jokari should do, we should all do, is take like one minute of voiceover, but then weave it in with a couple clips, and or maybe a report, but it's that style Jokari does, it is just sounds like, you know, million-dollar voice broadcaster.
[02:09:52.452 --> 02:09:58.716]  But then it's also, of course, a million and a million billion dollar voice broadcaster, but then it's the content and the words he chooses.
[02:09:59.337 --> 02:10:00.478]  Knight has a great talent.
[02:10:01.679 --> 02:10:02.499]  Biggs, all of them.
[02:10:02.519 --> 02:10:03.440]  I mean, they're all talented.
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:10.585]  It's just that Watson does like these three and four minute videos that are over the top strong.
[02:10:11.005 --> 02:10:19.151]  He did one on Sunday dealing with what the media doesn't want you to see, I think was the headline at the Chicago rally.
[02:10:21.018 --> 02:10:26.841]  And they did another one about the media promoting the assassination of Trump that's gone viral.
[02:10:27.342 --> 02:10:30.143]  But, you know, getting a half million views just isn't enough.
[02:10:32.024 --> 02:10:34.286]  We have videos that have, you know, 20 million views apiece.
[02:10:35.546 --> 02:10:36.447]  I want to dominate.
[02:10:38.561 --> 02:10:40.623]  But here's the new story on InfoWars.com.
[02:10:40.763 --> 02:10:43.807]  InfoWars featured in new Trump campaign video.
[02:10:43.887 --> 02:10:49.172]  It takes a clip of Paul's report, which Trump's welcome to use whatever we do, obviously.
[02:10:49.993 --> 02:10:55.499]  I think some of our graphics crew with the debate coverage graphics they made looks much better than anything Trump ever had.
[02:10:56.813 --> 02:10:57.353]  I'm just saying.
[02:10:58.093 --> 02:11:01.595]  We're just offering our services here to the battle against the elite.
[02:11:01.615 --> 02:11:12.338]  I mean, you got George Soros, the Communist Chinese, the Pope, the whole New World Order, foreign governments, the Clintons, the Republican establishment, saying they're going to steal the popular vote from this guy and we're not going to get behind him?
[02:11:13.159 --> 02:11:14.259]  It's an absolute no-brainer!
[02:11:16.263 --> 02:11:19.506]  So, Paul's got a bunch of these videos, and I've been meaning to play them.
[02:11:19.526 --> 02:11:21.728]  In fact, there's another one that I meant to play yesterday I didn't play.
[02:11:22.688 --> 02:11:23.509]  This is Jakari Report.
[02:11:23.529 --> 02:11:24.530]  I don't want to play too much.
[02:11:24.570 --> 02:11:25.871]  I just... And I want to go to your calls.
[02:11:25.911 --> 02:11:26.712]  I want to go to Dominique.
[02:11:27.272 --> 02:11:29.995]  I want to go to Jeff, Dave, Mel, Cameron.
[02:11:31.465 --> 02:11:31.906]  And others.
[02:11:32.066 --> 02:11:33.827]  But this video needs to go viral.
[02:11:33.947 --> 02:11:38.571]  And again, if you scroll down, you can see the assassination of Donald Trump.
[02:11:38.611 --> 02:11:39.732]  That's the latest video.
[02:11:40.313 --> 02:11:42.895]  But Paul needs to add his other video under it.
[02:11:43.516 --> 02:11:45.958]  Let's just go to his YouTube channel and give me the actual names of it.
[02:11:46.759 --> 02:11:49.081]  I'm going to start stuttering and bumbling around on air.
[02:11:49.882 --> 02:11:51.243]  It's because I can't get the answer to something.
[02:11:51.263 --> 02:11:51.783]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:11:52.164 --> 02:11:53.104]  Yeah, that one only has 124,000 views.
[02:11:53.124 --> 02:11:55.747]  There's another one that has a half million views.
[02:11:57.421 --> 02:12:04.586]  And again, we've got videos with like 800,000 views that are people fighting with each other, but then something really important like this doesn't get any views.
[02:12:04.966 --> 02:12:05.507]  Yeah, here's the one.
[02:12:05.527 --> 02:12:08.249]  The truth about the anti-Trump Chicago riot.
[02:12:08.269 --> 02:12:08.809]  675,000 views.
[02:12:08.829 --> 02:12:09.710]  Sounds great, doesn't it?
[02:12:09.730 --> 02:12:11.331]  No, it was 500,000 yesterday.
[02:12:14.747 --> 02:12:16.870]  It needs to be 67 million.
[02:12:17.310 --> 02:12:29.564]  We'll know the country's being saved when instead of it being Justin Bieber and his underwear, you know, getting 100 million views, somebody battling to at least allow us to have a level playing field for our industry.
[02:12:30.045 --> 02:12:34.450]  When people start getting concerned with that, that's when we know we've turned the corner.
[02:12:37.142 --> 02:12:39.223]  The assassination of Donald Trump is one of the videos.
[02:12:39.243 --> 02:12:41.805]  The truth about the anti-Trump Chicago riot.
[02:12:41.825 --> 02:12:46.387]  And when you look at this and you look at how he puts it all together in their own words, it's powerful.
[02:12:46.888 --> 02:12:49.369]  So let's play the new Donald Trump campaign ad.
[02:12:49.409 --> 02:12:50.329]  Great job, the crew.
[02:12:50.610 --> 02:12:52.971]  Just scrambled and just got this the last minute when I was told about it.
[02:12:53.531 --> 02:12:56.073]  And then we will go back to your calls and more news.
[02:12:56.113 --> 02:13:06.819]  But it is extremely important that you realize the real viral videos in the new war are going to come from you, from we the people.
[02:13:07.858 --> 02:13:08.518]  From all of us.
[02:13:09.219 --> 02:13:14.723]  Just as Trump isn't advertising and spending money with the establishment, he just puts out his videos, counting on the grassroots.
[02:13:15.244 --> 02:13:15.904]  That's what we do.
[02:13:15.964 --> 02:13:17.285]  We count on you to take action.
[02:13:17.625 --> 02:13:28.493]  They're doing everything they can to hack attack us, to denial of service attack us, to have horrible people come after us, dirty tricks, you name it.
[02:13:28.854 --> 02:13:29.774]  I don't complain about it.
[02:13:29.814 --> 02:13:30.415]  I'm not a victim.
[02:13:31.416 --> 02:13:32.136]  I'm an overcomer.
[02:13:33.898 --> 02:13:35.419]  And I love fighting tyrants.
[02:13:36.633 --> 02:13:39.535]  They think they're better, they think they're smarter, they think they got it all figured out.
[02:13:40.555 --> 02:13:44.037]  I've got to do what I'm doing because my guts won't let me do anything else.
[02:13:44.057 --> 02:13:44.638]  You understand that?
[02:13:45.578 --> 02:13:48.260]  My guts run the show, folks.
[02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:50.121]  And I can't screw anybody over.
[02:13:50.141 --> 02:13:51.822]  But let me tell you something.
[02:13:51.842 --> 02:13:55.524]  Somebody tries to screw me over, I don't take any pleasure in defeating them.
[02:13:56.124 --> 02:13:59.766]  Except the satisfaction of the fact that they're not going to be able to go on hurting others.
[02:14:00.247 --> 02:14:02.328]  Or they're going to have certainly been taught a serious lesson.
[02:14:03.612 --> 02:14:08.974]  These people want to dominate you and your family because they're lusting after power, because they're not powerful people.
[02:14:09.314 --> 02:14:10.194]  You are powerful.
[02:14:10.434 --> 02:14:25.959]  When you send an InfoWars link out on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, or a thousand other platforms, when you tell folks on iHeartRadio to tune into us and our podcast, when you tell people to, you know, to check out our videos and our free feeds, you are changing the world.
[02:14:26.119 --> 02:14:30.801]  You have the incredible power to crush the globalists, to break their back.
[02:14:32.281 --> 02:14:36.824]  You've already been taking action, and they're already scared, but if you really stand up, it's over.
[02:14:37.245 --> 02:14:38.405]  So commit every day.
[02:14:38.425 --> 02:14:41.347]  When you get up in the morning and you're drinking coffee, send out some InfoWars links.
[02:14:41.908 --> 02:14:46.391]  Sign off with InfoWars.com and, you know, a key point in your email.
[02:14:46.411 --> 02:14:47.492]  Tell folks at work about it.
[02:14:47.952 --> 02:14:51.453]  Yes, roll down your window, tell somebody to tune into the local station you're listening to right now.
[02:14:51.713 --> 02:14:53.334]  To listen to this broadcast.
[02:14:54.114 --> 02:14:55.814]  Become a sponsor at a local station.
[02:14:56.534 --> 02:14:58.295]  Go ask to speak in front of the church.
[02:14:58.355 --> 02:15:01.136]  Get up there and just talk about the attack on free speech in America.
[02:15:01.156 --> 02:15:06.877]  And say you may not even support Donald Trump, but the fact that churches aren't supposed to talk about our leaders and America is wrong.
[02:15:07.117 --> 02:15:07.758]  We have a right.
[02:15:07.998 --> 02:15:09.898]  We must exercise our free speech or lose it.
[02:15:10.518 --> 02:15:12.019]  These are the type of things you need to do.
[02:15:12.499 --> 02:15:13.979]  You have to get out of your comfort zone.
[02:15:14.499 --> 02:15:15.880]  And I know many of you have done it, but
[02:15:17.049 --> 02:15:20.832]  It's only a fraction of the listeners that actually buy products at infowarestore.com.
[02:15:21.693 --> 02:15:22.013]  We know.
[02:15:22.033 --> 02:15:26.476]  It is a fraction of the audience that spreads the word and shares links.
[02:15:26.997 --> 02:15:27.297]  We know.
[02:15:28.732 --> 02:15:29.613]  We have the analytics.
[02:15:30.413 --> 02:15:43.262]  And I'm telling you, if just a few more percentage points of you buy the products, if a few more percentage points of you out there spread the word, and send out links, and shoot your own YouTube videos, or do your own little radio show, I don't know, just do it!
[02:15:43.682 --> 02:15:47.085]  All of us doing something right now, this is the season of change.
[02:15:47.425 --> 02:15:49.927]  The enemy is coming in right now to take over.
[02:15:51.007 --> 02:15:53.609]  But, there is a spirit rising against it.
[02:15:55.110 --> 02:15:55.791]  Be part of that.
[02:15:56.687 --> 02:15:57.547]  Be part of history.
[02:15:57.927 --> 02:15:59.188]  It's the animating contest.
[02:15:59.208 --> 02:16:00.028]  Get excited!
[02:16:02.829 --> 02:16:04.090]  Don't let them grind you down.
[02:16:05.470 --> 02:16:06.250]  It's enjoyable.
[02:16:06.370 --> 02:16:08.111]  Say, lifting weights is an analogy.
[02:16:11.592 --> 02:16:21.715]  At first you start pushing those big heavy dumbbells up and maybe you're a little tight and it hurts, but after the second, third set, you got a lot bigger weights in your hands and it just feels so good to be doing it.
[02:16:22.476 --> 02:16:23.776]  It's like politics or life.
[02:16:23.816 --> 02:16:26.017]  You think it's not fun until you make it fun.
[02:16:27.543 --> 02:16:39.271]  It's so satisfying when you don't clean your garage out, and you feel all sick about it, and you procrastinate at first, it's kind of headachy, and you don't want to do it, and I can go in and watch TV, or I can go to the park, or I can go to a movie, or I've got to balance my checkbook online.
[02:16:39.291 --> 02:16:40.692]  You just go, I'm just going to clean the garage.
[02:16:40.732 --> 02:16:45.836]  You just clean the garage, throw it all out, sweep it all out, two hours later you're sweating, take a shower, you feel great, you have the best weekend ever.
[02:16:46.676 --> 02:16:56.459]  We gotta clean out Washington, we gotta clean out our neighborhoods, we gotta clean out our own lives as well, and just get out of being spectators, being run over, and in the arena.
[02:16:56.479 --> 02:16:59.040]  That's where the animating contest is.
[02:16:59.860 --> 02:17:09.483]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls from Costa Rica to South Carolina, from Pennsylvania to FEMA Region 3, but first, InfoWars featured new Donald Trump campaign video.
[02:17:09.503 --> 02:17:09.883]  Here it is.
[02:17:12.303 --> 02:17:13.784]  I am officially running
[02:17:16.533 --> 02:17:24.316]  For President of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again!
[02:17:26.617 --> 02:17:30.559]  Time Magazine, last week, did an incredible cover story.
[02:17:30.599 --> 02:17:32.080]  They said, it's a movement.
[02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:32.900]  And that's what it is.
[02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:36.021]  It's an incredible movement with incredible people.
[02:17:36.522 --> 02:17:37.502]  Incredible people.
[02:17:42.254 --> 02:17:44.915]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[02:17:45.015 --> 02:17:49.596]  They are going to people, showing videos of Donald Trump.
[02:17:49.736 --> 02:17:54.318]  It's a... it's a fierce disease.
[02:17:56.378 --> 02:18:08.602]  Unhinged mobs assaulted people, attacked police, tore up signs, blocked ambulances, fired guns in the air, and threatened to rape women.
[02:18:11.135 --> 02:18:17.820]  The liberal media and Ted Cruz and Brent's boy Marco Rubio are all blaming Donald Trump.
[02:18:18.681 --> 02:18:25.787]  Frankly, Donald has created a very toxic environment and it's really in dividing people.
[02:18:29.272 --> 02:18:34.213]  And liberals are always first in line to try to restrict the First Amendment rights of others.
[02:18:34.754 --> 02:18:39.235]  And I want to say a word about these other spineless GOP candidates.
[02:18:39.615 --> 02:18:56.659]  You know, instead of exploiting this situation to try to prop up their failing campaigns, what they ought to be doing is standing up and saying, you know, we may not agree with everything Trump says, we may not even like the way he says it, but we are standing in solidarity with his First Amendment rights.
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.640]  They won't do that because they're too weak.
[02:19:06.365 --> 02:19:15.771]  And that's why they push all those weak political candidates is because they will bend over, they will lay down, they will sell out, they think it's cute, they think it's fine, they don't believe in you, they don't believe in freedom.
[02:19:17.211 --> 02:19:18.532]  They want to silence everyone.
[02:19:18.552 --> 02:19:22.675]  And if they can silence Trump, they can silence everybody.
[02:19:24.189 --> 02:19:26.790]  The good news is the people are waking up to it.
[02:19:26.830 --> 02:19:28.611]  They're seeing through it in a big way.
[02:19:29.111 --> 02:19:37.676]  That's a strong video, but I'm telling you, it's nothing compared to the two Paul Watson videos that are also linked to the same story at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:19:38.096 --> 02:19:40.917]  I'm going to come back and take some phone calls, then I'm going to get into this fact.
[02:19:41.898 --> 02:19:42.598]  It is a problem.
[02:19:44.724 --> 02:19:47.987]  Trump is first and only candidate to qualify as GOP nominee.
[02:19:48.468 --> 02:19:53.193]  Trump meets delegate threshold for GOP's Rule 40, Kit Daniel's article, Infowars.com.
[02:19:53.213 --> 02:19:53.913]  But here's the problem.
[02:19:54.794 --> 02:19:56.916]  The RNC came out and said, we don't care.
[02:19:57.337 --> 02:19:58.838]  We warned you of this, but it's a big deal.
[02:19:59.179 --> 02:20:01.621]  They said, we're just going to take the delegates at the RNC.
[02:20:02.642 --> 02:20:03.583]  You go, well, that's crazy.
[02:20:04.024 --> 02:20:04.704]  That's the whole point.
[02:20:04.724 --> 02:20:06.006]  They work for the Democrats, folks.
[02:20:06.306 --> 02:20:07.707]  They're sabotaging in front of you.
[02:20:08.763 --> 02:20:12.046]  So you've got to take a state construction license exam or certification.
[02:20:12.206 --> 02:20:14.508]  Can't decide on what books or what chapters to study?

[02:20:38.652 --> 02:20:41.414]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[02:20:41.714 --> 02:20:44.336]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[02:20:44.356 --> 02:20:44.776]  Croix River.
[02:20:45.096 --> 02:20:45.757]  I loved my dad.
[02:20:46.137 --> 02:20:47.098]  But boy was he stubborn.
[02:20:47.338 --> 02:20:50.060]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:50.800]  His excuse?
[02:20:51.160 --> 02:20:52.241]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:20:52.501 --> 02:20:53.802]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[02:20:54.122 --> 02:20:59.626]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[02:20:59.866 --> 02:21:00.607]  Don't wait.
[02:21:00.907 --> 02:21:03.268]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.
[02:21:03.569 --> 02:21:05.810]  For not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones.
[02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:07.671]  Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[02:21:08.872 --> 02:21:12.975]  Biochemistry determines your mood, memory, energy, and endurance.
[02:21:13.215 --> 02:21:15.937]  Your body's primary metabolic function is to make protein.
[02:21:16.237 --> 02:21:18.979]  One World Way is a unique, non-denatured protein.
[02:21:19.179 --> 02:21:27.285]  This enables your body to have virtually 100% utilization, whereas typical whey protein powders offer no more than 18% utilization of protein.
[02:21:27.565 --> 02:21:30.567]  One World Way also delivers life-giving frequencies to your cells.
[02:21:30.687 --> 02:21:36.031]  The net result for so many people is improved energy, mood, and elimination of pain from inflammation.
[02:21:36.271 --> 02:21:40.513]  This technologically enhanced One World Way has been really amazing for me.
[02:21:40.673 --> 02:21:47.035]  I'm 36 years old and for the past several years I've been struggling with lack of energy, drive, and stamina.
[02:21:47.275 --> 02:21:51.056]  And after just two weeks on this product, I'm feeling so much more energy.
[02:21:51.116 --> 02:21:57.078]  My yoga practice has deepened and as a massage therapist, I'm able to see more clients than I've been able to in years.
[02:21:57.379 --> 02:22:00.360]  I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken.
[02:22:02.881 --> 02:22:15.750]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[02:22:15.890 --> 02:22:20.373]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[02:22:20.533 --> 02:22:31.040]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary, broad-spectrum, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:44.916]  Supernatural silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers, using a patented technology that is highly effective against colds, flus, infections, food poisoning, and yeast, in addition to many other pathogens.
[02:22:46.357 --> 02:22:46.858]  I think so.
[02:23:08.214 --> 02:23:12.036]  Serious investors and traders want to make 81% return in 60 seconds?
[02:23:12.557 --> 02:23:18.180]  Use the same secret algorithm professional hedge fund managers use to make billions of dollars of profits.
[02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:21.622]  Turn $250 into $4,903 in just 7 clicks of a mouse.
[02:23:22.022 --> 02:23:26.545]  Our tool is so simple that my 82-year-old grandmother can use it to make insane stock market profits.
[02:23:26.825 --> 02:23:29.026]  Go to BigBuckRiches.com.

[02:23:34.949 --> 02:23:37.331]  From the Robert Allen System, current returns not indicative of future results.
[02:23:37.816 --> 02:23:42.680]  Turn on the news and you'll hear stories of natural disasters, political unrest, and financial crisis.
[02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:46.703]  In times of uncertainty, how will you take care of your family's most basic needs?

[02:24:11.963 --> 02:24:16.165]  We're gonna go to Cameron, we're gonna go to John, Dave, Michael and others.
[02:24:16.185 --> 02:24:17.865]  But first, Costa Rica.
[02:24:18.406 --> 02:24:19.506]  Beautiful Costa Rica.
[02:24:19.946 --> 02:24:24.088]  Never been to Costa Rica, but I've seen videos and photos that say it's about as pretty as it gets.
[02:24:24.548 --> 02:24:25.909]  Why am I digressing off into that?
[02:24:26.469 --> 02:24:28.490]  Because I talk about the next thing pops in my head, that's why.
[02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:32.251]  You talk about teleprompter free, talking point free, this is it.
[02:24:32.952 --> 02:24:35.573]  Mel in Costa Rica, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:24:35.613 --> 02:24:36.213]  Thanks for calling.
[02:24:37.310 --> 02:24:42.373]  Wow, Mr. Alex Jones, it's been since 1999 that I've been trying to talk with you.
[02:24:42.393 --> 02:24:43.254]  It's unbelievable.
[02:24:43.754 --> 02:24:45.576]  I'm very excited right now, very emotional.
[02:24:45.636 --> 02:24:47.037]  I'll tell you the truth.
[02:24:47.837 --> 02:24:50.319]  I've been listening to you religiously, my friend, forever.
[02:24:50.339 --> 02:24:52.000]  I tell everybody to listen to you.
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:55.002]  There is no new world order in Costa Rica.
[02:24:55.082 --> 02:24:57.744]  If there is one, I can tell you the cops do not enforce it.
[02:24:58.479 --> 02:24:58.819]  Okay?
[02:24:59.599 --> 02:25:02.940]  Donald Trump is coughing nails to the New World Order.
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.421]  There's no question about it.
[02:25:04.441 --> 02:25:05.561]  I hope they don't kill him.
[02:25:05.881 --> 02:25:09.842]  I hope he wears a helmet on his head because they might take a shot and go for his head.
[02:25:10.503 --> 02:25:11.423]  Let me tell you something.
[02:25:11.443 --> 02:25:14.224]  There's a movement going on in the United States.
[02:25:14.464 --> 02:25:20.165]  It almost makes me want to move back to the United States for like six months out of the year, as long as Trump is in power.
[02:25:20.545 --> 02:25:22.146]  But I'll tell you what, Mr. Jones.
[02:25:23.007 --> 02:25:26.053]  They're going to do everything in the book to try and derail him.
[02:25:26.073 --> 02:25:28.097]  They're going to come up with every dirty trick in the book.
[02:25:28.357 --> 02:25:29.158]  Let me tell you something.
[02:25:29.499 --> 02:25:34.689]  When they come up with something like, hey, you know, they, um, his wife froze naked.
[02:25:35.906 --> 02:25:38.168]  Who would you rather picture naked?
[02:25:38.548 --> 02:25:41.050]  Her or Barbara Bush, right, for example?
[02:26:05.986 --> 02:26:06.467]  I don't think so.
[02:26:22.876 --> 02:26:28.038]  You know, something like that and my daughter be out there say working on an abortuary.
[02:26:28.298 --> 02:26:30.238]  You know, there's scales of all this.
[02:26:30.678 --> 02:26:31.639]  None of us are perfect.
[02:26:31.679 --> 02:26:32.719]  We want to love God.
[02:26:32.779 --> 02:26:33.719]  We want to be good.
[02:26:34.159 --> 02:26:36.500]  But we don't sit there using it as a way.
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:38.761]  It's like Christian political correctness.
[02:26:39.061 --> 02:26:41.942]  There's all these social justice warrior Christians.
[02:26:43.623 --> 02:26:53.491]  That kind of political correctness comes out of who go around hen-pecking everybody, men and women, about how good they are policing your speech or your behavior or how you act.
[02:26:53.812 --> 02:26:56.734]  They ought to get the beam out of their eye first, brother.
[02:26:57.095 --> 02:26:59.357]  So what do you think will happen if they do assassinate Trump?
[02:26:59.377 --> 02:27:00.578]  Because I'll just be honest.
[02:27:01.992 --> 02:27:05.615]  I think there's about a 70% chance somebody's going to take a shot at him.
[02:27:06.035 --> 02:27:08.436]  I think there's about a 40-50% chance they're going to kill him.
[02:27:08.797 --> 02:27:10.798]  I really, he's for real, there's no doubt.
[02:27:11.118 --> 02:27:15.161]  I think they're going to try to kill him and I think there's a 70% chance somebody's going to pull a trigger.
[02:27:15.561 --> 02:27:19.043]  Again, 40-50% chance it's going to hit him and a good chance it's going to kill him.
[02:27:19.064 --> 02:27:19.524]  What do you think?
[02:27:20.854 --> 02:27:36.139]  Well, I hope not, and I'll tell you what, even if he wins by overwhelming demand and they fix the voting machines, because they are programmed by the government, unfortunately, and if you trust these voting machines, you need to go get a checkup from the NECCP, okay?
[02:27:36.499 --> 02:27:48.203]  The reality is that I think that there'll be riots all over the United States, like maybe times 10 or 20, what we saw in LA for Rodney King, from coast to coast, not just in LA.
[02:27:49.003 --> 02:27:52.766]  But then they'll activate Black Lives Matter to go out and riot, and they'll call it a race war.
[02:27:53.006 --> 02:27:59.010]  You'll have Trumpians upset rioting in key areas, and then you'll have the Soros activate to cause a civil war.
[02:27:59.090 --> 02:27:59.931]  We do not want that.
[02:28:00.331 --> 02:28:06.095]  By the way, reports Trump left off some Florida ballots, dozens of complaints.
[02:28:06.495 --> 02:28:07.676]  That's from the Gateway Pundit.
[02:28:07.716 --> 02:28:11.138]  That's up on DrudgeReport.com and Infowars.com right now.
[02:28:11.178 --> 02:28:13.280]  Good to hear from you, Mel, in Costa Rica.
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:13.440]  Yeah.
[02:28:14.827 --> 02:28:19.534]  Costa Rica is a government, globalist, command-based, safe zone, kind of like Switzerland.
[02:28:19.554 --> 02:28:28.287]  I don't know if it will be as good as Switzerland forever, but the word is, I need to get down there and check it out, the word is, is it is the cat's meow of Central America.
[02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:32.490]  But it's surrounded by collapsing third world hells.
[02:28:33.051 --> 02:28:41.174]  So, good thing they got a strong border fence, and good thing they picked folks up to try to work there illegally, because they don't want their country collapsing and their wages driven down.
[02:28:41.494 --> 02:28:42.855]  I've studied Costa Rica, but I haven't been there.
[02:28:43.135 --> 02:28:44.576]  Quite frankly, it's my next stop.
[02:28:45.056 --> 02:28:46.997]  The next time I leave the United States, that's where I'm going.
[02:28:47.317 --> 02:28:48.617]  I may go cover Bilderberg.
[02:28:48.657 --> 02:28:49.638]  I'm trying to decide right now.
[02:28:49.678 --> 02:28:50.578]  My kids really need me.
[02:28:51.139 --> 02:28:52.659]  And I kind of need to run the command base here.
[02:28:53.019 --> 02:28:54.140]  I want to go cover Bilderberg.
[02:28:54.820 --> 02:28:55.560]  Yeah, how are you doing Alex?
[02:28:55.620 --> 02:28:58.101]  Hey listen, I wanted to ask Gerald, but you'd be just as good at this.
[02:28:58.121 --> 02:29:02.422]  First thing I wanted to say is that the Republicans were fully aware of what was going on in Chicago.
[02:29:19.514 --> 02:29:24.358]  Yeah, well, I'll tell you what really stunned me is that Friday night I was watching Fox's Kelly Show, you know, just to see what she had to say.
[02:29:47.543 --> 02:29:53.447]  And she had Rubio on the phone, and he came out with what sounded like a recurrent statement.
[02:29:53.467 --> 02:29:55.168]  Stay there, I'm going to come back to you, John.
[02:29:55.428 --> 02:29:56.929]  This is a point I've been wanting to talk about.
[02:29:58.010 --> 02:29:58.930]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.431 --> 02:30:01.032]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:01.952 --> 02:30:04.634]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:08.661 --> 02:30:13.985]  In a rather bizarre statement, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has said that the U.S.
[02:30:14.045 --> 02:30:22.492]  didn't lose a single person in Libya, which is to say the former Secretary of State is ignoring the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
[02:30:22.793 --> 02:30:24.914]  Now, Libya is perfect, isn't it?
[02:30:25.034 --> 02:30:25.695]  Clinton said.
[02:30:26.095 --> 02:30:30.259]  Libya was a different kind of calculation, and we didn't lose a single person.
[02:30:30.519 --> 02:30:35.383]  We didn't have a problem in supporting our European and Arab allies in working with NATO.
[02:30:35.723 --> 02:30:44.526]  Mrs. Clinton conveniently skipped over the attack of September 11, 2012 on the diplomatic special mission compound in CIA Annex in Benghazi.
[02:30:44.726 --> 02:30:53.048]  The left ambassador Christopher Stevens, foreign management officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Smith and Glenn Doherty dead.
[02:30:53.248 --> 02:30:55.869]  There's even a movie out about it called 13 Hours.
[02:30:56.309 --> 02:31:01.371]  And this isn't the first time Hillary has had a selective memory, but what difference does it make?

[02:32:12.711 --> 02:32:17.312]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[02:32:17.453 --> 02:32:18.473]  Talk about the effects.
[02:32:18.793 --> 02:32:20.273]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[02:32:20.293 --> 02:32:21.914]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[02:32:22.234 --> 02:32:23.294]  I feel like I look better.
[02:32:23.354 --> 02:32:23.995]  I feel better.
[02:32:24.055 --> 02:32:25.135]  I feel sexier.
[02:32:25.455 --> 02:32:25.815]  I love it.
[02:32:26.095 --> 02:32:28.996]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[02:32:29.056 --> 02:32:31.757]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.

[02:32:33.078 --> 02:32:34.099]  Consult your physician.

[02:33:18.849 --> 02:33:20.471]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:20.771 --> 02:33:31.841]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:32.161 --> 02:33:40.189]  I'm gonna go back to one of these calls, then pop into Dr. Group for ten minutes, then back to your calls and into some geopolitical news I need to hit, but...
[02:33:44.085 --> 02:33:49.809]  To answer my own question, I asked Gerald Celente a question that he answered excellently, but I wanted to add to it last hour.
[02:33:49.909 --> 02:33:56.734]  I said, why in history, when there's economic meltdown, do you always see major powers go to war?
[02:33:57.735 --> 02:33:59.396]  Especially if both sides are having problems.
[02:34:00.377 --> 02:34:05.040]  And it's because it makes the domestic groups shut up and not try to overthrow their own government.
[02:34:05.060 --> 02:34:13.266]  Because instead, they're putting all their anger onto the other group, and all the young men are getting killed or maimed battling the other group's young men.
[02:34:14.224 --> 02:34:16.866]  There's famous letters between, you know, different kings in Europe.
[02:34:17.806 --> 02:34:24.670]  There's one between the King of France and the King of England, where they talk about, yeah, we're having some uprisings, some issues.
[02:34:24.730 --> 02:34:25.931]  It's time for another war.
[02:34:28.732 --> 02:34:30.093]  And it consolidates power.
[02:34:31.354 --> 02:34:33.255]  And it destroys surplus equipment.
[02:34:33.295 --> 02:34:35.576]  So you've got to buy more equipment.
[02:34:35.596 --> 02:34:36.677]  You've got to go deeper in debt.
[02:34:38.049 --> 02:34:51.994]  When you enter these perfect storms, though, like before World War I or World War II, and almost all historians agree, we're in that sector right now, the most dangerous time to ever be alive, because the weapons we now have, the Pentagon says that, the Ministry of Defense says that, in England.
[02:34:53.394 --> 02:34:56.875]  It's also that the political class is basically an oligarchy.
[02:34:56.895 --> 02:35:04.678]  It's a big group of thieves at the top who kind of decide things by consensus and board meetings at Davos, Bilderberg, you name it.
[02:35:05.945 --> 02:35:08.627]  Now the public knows those consensus meetings are going on.
[02:35:09.988 --> 02:35:12.910]  They never even wanted to have that discussion as if they didn't even exist.
[02:35:14.271 --> 02:35:16.112]  Now people are discussing the elites.
[02:35:16.793 --> 02:35:19.655]  Now we can look at how they're exempt from taxes and regulations.
[02:35:20.155 --> 02:35:21.116]  So that's a huge victory.
[02:35:21.716 --> 02:35:28.341]  But the other big factor that's entered into this equation, into this calculus, is that
[02:35:29.970 --> 02:35:37.176]  When a system's coming to an end, or when major changes are happening at the end of a cycle, or the beginning of a cycle, it's pretty much the same point.
[02:35:38.837 --> 02:35:41.899]  You can't tell when you're ending and when you're beginning until you've already gone out of it.
[02:35:41.999 --> 02:35:45.242]  But we're definitely in the major time of change right now, pretty deep into it.
[02:35:45.482 --> 02:35:46.563]  I'd say a third in.
[02:35:48.624 --> 02:35:59.253]  And with the acceleration of time compression because of technology and everything, and the move towards the mathematical gravity of a singularity, because we're entering into that,
[02:36:00.233 --> 02:36:01.894]  And it's compressing time and change.
[02:36:02.474 --> 02:36:05.515]  It might be a year, it might be five years, but it's moving quick.
[02:36:06.456 --> 02:36:10.858]  Whereas previously change like this would take 20 years, might take five years, might take a year, might take a month.
[02:36:10.958 --> 02:36:11.598]  Who knows?
[02:36:11.938 --> 02:36:13.219]  It's accelerating is all we know.
[02:36:13.459 --> 02:36:14.620]  We're in uncharted territory.
[02:36:17.021 --> 02:36:26.005]  And so the other big factor is that there's so many special interests that have these consortium meetings, it's hard to find the head to ever stop it.
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:37.587]  That's a strength of it for its system, but it's also a weakness because the consortiums are fake and they all stab each other in the back more and more as the system destabilizes.
[02:36:38.308 --> 02:36:41.410]  So they're all stealing everything, backstabbing each other.
[02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:43.191]  Many of them are running for the hills.
[02:36:43.231 --> 02:36:44.672]  I told you that six, seven years ago.
[02:36:44.972 --> 02:36:46.013]  Folks said I was a fear monger.
[02:36:46.033 --> 02:36:56.400]  Now it's all over the news that elites are building bunkers and moving to the middle of nowhere and digging in and building offshore pleasure palaces and their own private armies because they know the
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:01.124]  Mountain of TNT we're sitting on top of, historically and politically.
[02:37:02.626 --> 02:37:05.649]  So you add that factor in, that's a real wild card.
[02:37:05.709 --> 02:37:10.154]  And so that's why it's going to look like they're confident doing wilder and wilder things.
[02:37:10.914 --> 02:37:13.717]  Stealing openly, openly announcing all this evil.
[02:37:14.378 --> 02:37:16.660]  That's not a sign of strength folks, it's a sign of weakness.
[02:37:17.201 --> 02:37:20.044]  That they're just busy going, okay forget it, steal all we can.
[02:37:21.775 --> 02:37:24.136]  As they get their private jets warmed up.
[02:37:24.576 --> 02:37:28.638]  These elites have jets warm 24 hours a day with crews.
[02:37:29.578 --> 02:37:35.001]  With containers just full of diamonds and emeralds and art and just all sorts of stuff.
[02:37:35.041 --> 02:37:35.861]  I mean, it's admitted.
[02:37:36.561 --> 02:37:38.002]  They are now in panic mode.
[02:37:38.262 --> 02:37:39.182]  That's in the news now.
[02:37:39.422 --> 02:37:41.103]  With their jets warmed up.
[02:37:41.343 --> 02:37:42.964]  With the helicopters ready.
[02:37:43.936 --> 02:37:49.619]  For nuclear war, bio war, total collapse, power allergies, asteroids, I don't know!
[02:37:50.220 --> 02:37:52.001]  But they're acting like it's the end of the world.
[02:37:52.841 --> 02:38:00.465]  Now I'm going to go Dr. Group here in just a moment, but finishing up with John in FEMA Region 3, because he was mentioning it, and I should have talked about this or told my crew to work on it, but we can only do so much.
[02:38:01.466 --> 02:38:02.126]  I've seen Kasich.
[02:38:03.187 --> 02:38:03.947]  I've seen Soros.
[02:38:04.448 --> 02:38:08.050]  I've seen, on the subject Republicans, I've seen Cruz.
[02:38:08.790 --> 02:38:09.871]  I've seen Rubio.
[02:38:09.951 --> 02:38:12.032]  I've seen them all come out and criticize Trump.
[02:38:13.442 --> 02:38:16.744]  For Chicago, when he didn't say it, they cancelled his event!
[02:38:16.984 --> 02:38:18.785]  They cancelled his free speech with threats!
[02:38:19.226 --> 02:38:20.046]  He did nothing!
[02:38:20.367 --> 02:38:21.928]  His rhetoric's not incendiary.
[02:38:21.948 --> 02:38:26.010]  It's like, can you believe Alex Jones is against open borders?
[02:38:26.050 --> 02:38:26.831]  It's so evil!
[02:38:27.271 --> 02:38:30.633]  Can you believe Alex Jones is against screen doors on submarines?
[02:38:31.374 --> 02:38:33.115]  They just invert reality.
[02:38:33.135 --> 02:38:39.099]  So I wanted you to be able to finish up, because I actually heard the Rubio call you're talking about on XM Fox.
[02:38:39.119 --> 02:38:39.419]  Go ahead.
[02:38:42.892 --> 02:39:01.969]  You couldn't see him because he was on the phone so I would think that he was reading off a paper but not more than a minute later after he got off the phone they had a live feed from a hotel in Chicago with Bruce came out first thing out of his mouth was the exact
[02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:04.901]  That was the turning point for me.
[02:39:04.921 --> 02:39:07.682]  I mean, that was really absolutely stunning to me.
[02:39:07.742 --> 02:39:11.324]  Yep, I actually saw the man behind the curtain and I don't like it.
[02:39:29.969 --> 02:39:34.112]  So, tell me, were you liking Cruz before, but when you saw him in a concerted effort with Rubio, you saw it?
[02:39:35.273 --> 02:39:58.131]  Well, you know, back a couple years ago when they had the shutdown of the government and Cruz and Palin were out there at the shutdown Veterans Memorial in Washington, you know, he seemed pretty good to me, you know, and then the Bundy thing happened and everybody ran, everybody ran away from that like they had the plague.
[02:39:58.652 --> 02:40:00.112]  Well, they should have been supporting him.
[02:40:01.633 --> 02:40:06.513]  Cruz did a lot of really great stuff, and that's why I ignored the CFR stuff and the rest of it.
[02:40:06.553 --> 02:40:07.494]  I said I was concerned.
[02:40:07.894 --> 02:40:12.074]  But now, the stuff he's doing, if he wasn't bad before, he's made a really bad turn.
[02:40:12.114 --> 02:40:21.856]  He may rehabilitate himself and still be a good senator and make some good votes, but if he tries to steal the election when he doesn't have as many delegates from Trump, he is committing political suicide, in my view.
[02:40:21.896 --> 02:40:22.496]  God bless you, John.
[02:40:22.536 --> 02:40:23.096]  Thanks for calling.
[02:40:24.517 --> 02:40:26.537]  Now, we talk about the big
[02:40:27.975 --> 02:40:52.887]  seen of things but we also talk about what's happening down here on the ground individually and that's why I've got him coming on today because I saw this article yesterday and I was well aware of this fact obviously and so were you but to see it in Bloomberg business and to see that it's two of the biggest drug companies saying it and Chicago
[02:40:54.215 --> 02:40:58.316]  Researchers and top genetic genome project group of the federal government.
[02:40:58.336 --> 02:41:01.497]  I mean, it's just a group coming out saying biggest discovery ever.
[02:41:02.497 --> 02:41:03.137]  We discovered it.
[02:41:03.177 --> 02:41:04.277]  They're saying give us prizes.
[02:41:05.137 --> 02:41:08.398]  Most cancer is being caused because your autoimmune system is shutting off in the gut.
[02:41:09.738 --> 02:41:10.638]  It's like HIV.
[02:41:10.919 --> 02:41:17.060]  If your immune system has already run down, you get it, and then your body basically stops fighting.
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:22.501]  It attacks your T lymphocytes that are the program cells that go out and tell folks who the enemy is.
[02:41:24.403 --> 02:41:25.284]  They're basically generals.
[02:41:25.584 --> 02:41:26.904]  Takes out your generals and your colonels.
[02:41:27.505 --> 02:41:28.205]  Down to your majors.
[02:41:29.146 --> 02:41:31.587]  But the gut is the major front line.
[02:41:32.868 --> 02:41:39.812]  And so, when it turns off, and stops communicating with the rest of the body, and stops communicating with the white blood cells of the brain, it's game over.
[02:41:40.312 --> 02:41:42.373]  Folks, they knew this thousands of years ago.
[02:41:42.393 --> 02:41:46.375]  I quoted, Anthony quoted Hippocrates, we get the Hippocratic Oath, do no harm.
[02:41:46.556 --> 02:41:48.637]  They quit giving that 10 years ago, by the way, or about 12 years ago.
[02:41:48.677 --> 02:41:50.818]  No more Hippocratic Oath for the doctors.
[02:41:50.858 --> 02:41:52.399]  Ought to be a red flag for folks.
[02:41:53.752 --> 02:41:54.033]  I don't know.
[02:42:06.127 --> 02:42:24.511]  The medical doctor, Dr. Wakefield, who lives in Austin, who did studies showing that autism was being caused by the gut shutting off, and then he found vaccine derivatives in the stomach antibodies, and that that was linked to it, and then it was toxic, poisoning the brain.
[02:42:24.731 --> 02:42:28.431]  Well, point is, there's now hundreds of big studies coming out proving it.
[02:42:28.651 --> 02:42:29.592]  They've always known.
[02:42:29.872 --> 02:42:31.152]  They've been trying to cover it up.
[02:42:32.069 --> 02:42:34.793]  And, group's been proven correct yet again.
[02:42:35.214 --> 02:42:38.078]  Now, it's not just probiotics that are needed, and we're going to come out with one soon.
[02:42:38.118 --> 02:42:39.280]  We're working on it years with group.
[02:42:40.181 --> 02:42:42.164]  We want to have the super, you know, the very best.
[02:42:42.965 --> 02:42:45.489]  But, whatever you do, there's a lot of brands out there.
[02:42:45.529 --> 02:42:47.351]  We'll get his expert view on what he thinks is good.
[02:42:48.106 --> 02:42:55.412]  But, iodine, I'm going to show you the studies, is just as important with the thyroid, ordering the stomach to basically turn on and activate.
[02:42:55.432 --> 02:43:08.504]  Now that's in layman dumbo terms, and I'll have Dr. Group break it down for you, but how gut bacteria are shaking up cancer research is the Bloomberg article, and it goes right through, word for word, what Group and all these others have been saying forever.
[02:43:08.544 --> 02:43:12.868]  And of course, Bill and Melinda Gates are obsessed with it, they're heavily researching it, they know what they're doing.
[02:43:13.368 --> 02:43:14.949]  And a lot of stuff's killing your gut flora.
[02:43:14.969 --> 02:43:17.431]  It's the pesticides, the Roundup's the big one.
[02:43:17.951 --> 02:43:19.132]  This has all been engineered.
[02:43:19.232 --> 02:43:30.339]  My question to Group First is, congratulations being right yet again, because this is what you mainly focus on, but also, why are they now admitting it when we know these studies have been going on forever?
[02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:32.141]  What's the sea change there?
[02:43:32.161 --> 02:43:40.686]  It's like two weeks ago, the New York Times said, most cancers from viruses, as if they discovered that it's been known for 100 years, and they're actually putting it in the vaccine.
[02:43:40.706 --> 02:43:41.167]  We've caught them.
[02:43:41.527 --> 02:43:43.208]  So what do you think's happening here, Dr. Group?
[02:43:44.268 --> 02:43:59.135]  Well, I think they're being forced to join the bandwagon because they see the amount of money that's being made in the organic industry and in the natural healthcare industry, and they know that we're all putting lots of money and lots of time and lots of effort into educating the public.
[02:43:59.155 --> 02:44:02.996]  I mean, Hippocrates also said, all disease begins in the gut.
[02:44:03.456 --> 02:44:08.799]  When I came out with my first book back in the late 90s, it was called Health Begins in the Colon.
[02:44:08.859 --> 02:44:11.360]  Well, disease also begins in the gut because
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:26.230]  We spent two years researching the root cause of all disease, cancer, illness, and we came back to the general conclusion that it's all caused by all these chemicals and toxins and GMOs and high fructose corn syrup and pesticide residue.
[02:44:26.791 --> 02:44:27.691]  And guess what?
[02:44:28.012 --> 02:44:32.115]  It all ends up coming and leaking through the gut into your body.
[02:44:32.155 --> 02:44:33.796]  That's how all disease happens.
[02:44:34.416 --> 02:44:40.321]  So what's amazing to me, reading the Bloomberg article yesterday or the day before when it came out,
[02:44:41.181 --> 02:44:50.103]  Here you have pharmaceutical companies investing hundreds of millions of dollars into probiotics, but they're still missing the root cause.
[02:44:50.403 --> 02:44:52.723]  You still have to address the root cause of the illness.
[02:44:52.943 --> 02:45:06.506]  It doesn't matter if you have the best probiotics in the world, which by the way you mentioned, we've been working on some amazing technology that you're going to be the first, our company and your company is going to be the first ones in the world to come out with this.
[02:45:07.746 --> 02:45:14.211]  A new probiotic formula which has strains from 10,000 years ago.
[02:45:14.271 --> 02:45:19.514]  We were able to get some from up in Tibet in the Himalayan mountains, which I'm extremely excited about.
[02:45:20.215 --> 02:45:25.118]  But it all boils back to how the gut reacts with everything else in the body.
[02:45:25.138 --> 02:45:26.339]  And the gut is just a pipe.
[02:45:26.399 --> 02:45:27.360]  It's the outside.
[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:32.984]  I mean, what you take in through the food and the beverages that you consume on a daily basis
[02:45:33.624 --> 02:45:38.327]  The stuff that's not supposed to go into your body is supposed to go out the other end.
[02:45:38.367 --> 02:45:39.547]  The gut is just a tube.
[02:45:39.648 --> 02:45:40.728]  It's 35 feet long.
[02:45:41.268 --> 02:45:44.550]  If you were to take it out and cut it open, it would be the size of a tennis court.
[02:45:45.231 --> 02:45:54.936]  But what the pharmaceutical companies and the doctors, and by the way, big pharma and the medical profession, this was the highly guarded secret to health.
[02:45:55.216 --> 02:45:57.258]  They did not want you to figure out
[02:45:58.118 --> 02:46:00.279]  That if you heal the gut, you heal the body.
[02:46:00.299 --> 02:46:04.742]  So what do I call this video so people, when we put it on YouTube and Facebook, will care about themselves?
[02:46:05.802 --> 02:46:08.704]  Biggest, you know, medical tyranny secret exposed.
[02:46:09.564 --> 02:46:15.387]  Elite scared that this secret has finally gotten out because, as you know, we've documented, done hour-long shows.
[02:46:15.888 --> 02:46:18.389]  Bill and Melinda Gates, the elite, they're obsessed.
[02:46:18.449 --> 02:46:19.690]  They're all taking probiotics.
[02:46:20.683 --> 02:46:21.604]  That's how it leaked out.
[02:46:22.004 --> 02:46:23.165]  They know it's the roundup.
[02:46:23.566 --> 02:46:24.927]  They know it's the autism.
[02:46:25.227 --> 02:46:26.368]  They know it's everything.
[02:46:26.388 --> 02:46:28.710]  And they're doing everything they can to shut this down.
[02:46:28.991 --> 02:46:31.193]  This is a big victory that it's all coming out now.
[02:46:32.714 --> 02:46:42.284]  So in a normal human, you have a hundred trillion, let's say, organisms that are good, that are friendly, that are actually fighting for you.
[02:46:42.784 --> 02:46:45.027]  It's the army within your own body.
[02:46:45.307 --> 02:46:51.453]  They're the buffers that live in all the nooks and crannies, so bad bacteria and bad viruses can't move in.
[02:46:51.734 --> 02:46:54.537]  When they all get wiped out, the bad guys now have homes.
[02:46:55.839 --> 02:47:02.402]  And that's exactly what they do with the high fructose corn syrup and everything else in the food and the preservatives and everything else.
[02:47:02.422 --> 02:47:03.022]  Let me ask you that.
[02:47:03.082 --> 02:47:04.222]  What's killing our guts?
[02:47:04.663 --> 02:47:07.104]  And on top of probiotics, what are some of the better brands?
[02:47:08.244 --> 02:47:09.605]  How important is the nascent iodine?
[02:47:09.625 --> 02:47:10.485]  Because that is a plug.
[02:47:10.765 --> 02:47:11.585]  It's a win-win, folks.
[02:47:11.625 --> 02:47:13.766]  This is really the other part of the equation.
[02:47:14.106 --> 02:47:19.208]  Just as important, according to you and others, as the probiotics itself, the thyroid, the nerves, the gut.
[02:47:19.789 --> 02:47:22.310]  If the fluoride's in there, it can't communicate properly.
[02:47:22.350 --> 02:47:23.130]  Explain that to folks.
[02:47:23.450 --> 02:47:30.573]  Well, that's another attack with the toxic halogens because the gut, if you look at it, is the largest endocrine gland.
[02:47:30.593 --> 02:47:38.176]  And we talk all the time about the attack on the endocrine system, which is the thyroid, the pineal, the parathyroid, the pancreas.
[02:47:39.076 --> 02:47:51.143]  The ovaries, the breasts, the testicular functioning in males, all of these endocrine glands, the glandular system is what's being attacked and there's a connection there.
[02:47:51.524 --> 02:47:56.947]  And without iodine, iodine is necessary for all of our glands in the endocrine system to function.
[02:47:57.327 --> 02:47:59.909]  So what they do is they put fluoride, chlorine, bromide,
[02:48:00.609 --> 02:48:04.430]  In the water, in the food supply, which shuts down our glandular function.
[02:48:04.530 --> 02:48:09.492]  As a matter of fact, estrogen itself limits the absorption of iodine.
[02:48:10.052 --> 02:48:12.193]  So with all the xenoestrogens too.
[02:48:12.273 --> 02:48:15.094]  So iodine is an important part and that's what they're forgetting.
[02:48:15.114 --> 02:48:21.837]  You know, you have to have, you can't just have probiotics without all the other things working in unison as well.
[02:48:22.237 --> 02:48:27.579]  They'll probably end up maybe putting some iodine in with the probiotics, but it's an essential factor
[02:48:28.419 --> 02:48:40.348]  For a functioning endocrine system, if you don't have the proper amount of iodine in your body, then your thyroid is malfunctioning, then your pancreas is malfunctioning, your gut is malfunctioning.
[02:48:41.108 --> 02:48:48.814]  T3 and T4, which are produced by the thyroid, have been shown to protect the gut mucosal lining, to protect it from
[02:48:50.086 --> 02:48:51.427]  Leaky gut syndrome.
[02:48:52.068 --> 02:48:54.870]  Hashimoto's has been associated with a leaky gut.
[02:48:54.910 --> 02:48:59.253]  So thyroid, mental, everything is linked to the gut.
[02:48:59.293 --> 02:49:06.999]  I mean, the Russians and the Germans knew that years ago when they analyzed the appendix, which our medical system still says the appendix is useless.
[02:49:07.079 --> 02:49:09.841]  They found that the appendix is the brain of the body.
[02:49:10.301 --> 02:49:15.185]  And the brain is actually located at the small intestine and large intestine juncture.
[02:49:15.805 --> 02:49:17.968]  The appendix is the microcomputer.
[02:49:18.048 --> 02:49:25.916]  It actually sends relays and messages to the endocrine, the neurological, the lymphatic, all of the systems in the body.
[02:49:25.956 --> 02:49:30.281]  So every single thing is regulated in the gut, your immune system.
[02:49:31.192 --> 02:49:41.178]  Your serotonin, dopamine production for the brain, the T lymphocytes, the everything that you can think of.
[02:49:41.518 --> 02:49:48.502]  And that's usually functioned by and controlled by the amount of probiotics that you have inside the gut.
[02:49:48.542 --> 02:49:56.046]  And that's why I think that the pharmaceutical companies are realizing that they finally have to go down that path.
[02:49:56.086 --> 02:49:57.106]  That's what they're doing.
[02:49:57.186 --> 02:49:57.727]  I mean, look at
[02:49:58.547 --> 02:50:02.010]  Bloomberg coming out with the article on probiotics and cancer.
[02:50:02.070 --> 02:50:03.712]  So, it is the main thing.
[02:50:03.752 --> 02:50:08.776]  Well, what's happening is mainstream media, mainstream science is literally
[02:50:10.069 --> 02:50:17.394]  Coming out and confirming everything that you and a bunch of other medical doctors and the top experts on this show have said for the last 20 years.
[02:50:18.255 --> 02:50:32.964]  Not just saying something similar, with major huge studies at the Human Genome Project and the Chicago Medical Center and all of it, saying the exact thing you have been saying, which is what the ancients said, which is what has just been known.
[02:50:33.705 --> 02:50:36.047]  And so congratulations to everybody.
[02:50:36.087 --> 02:50:37.507]  This is another huge victory.
[02:50:37.548 --> 02:50:37.908]  And folks,
[02:50:39.346 --> 02:50:44.553]  Obviously, you need probiotics and you need to get... Group, you talk about the pickled foods.
[02:50:45.154 --> 02:50:47.276]  Let's talk about some of the foods folks get at the grocery store.
[02:50:47.296 --> 02:50:50.520]  It's not just about buying our products that also help with the gut.
[02:50:51.519 --> 02:50:53.381]  But again, folks, you can't lose the weight.
[02:50:54.122 --> 02:50:55.423]  Group told me you're gonna lose weight.
[02:50:55.904 --> 02:50:58.887]  You're going to tan better without tan spots.
[02:50:58.967 --> 02:50:59.327]  Watch it.
[02:50:59.548 --> 02:51:01.009]  I got on iodine for six months.
[02:51:01.530 --> 02:51:03.011]  I didn't have the liver spots anymore.
[02:51:03.091 --> 02:51:04.793]  I didn't get the sunburn spots like I did.
[02:51:05.033 --> 02:51:05.854]  I lost tons of weight.
[02:51:05.914 --> 02:51:07.716]  I mean, it just turned my body back on.
[02:51:07.776 --> 02:51:08.397]  I had to have it.
[02:51:08.497 --> 02:51:09.438]  This is Sharon Hunt.
[02:51:09.738 --> 02:51:13.102]  Before using hardened body extract, my energy level was very, very low.
[02:51:13.587 --> 02:51:16.488]  I could only walk a few feet and then would have to sit down.
[02:51:16.849 --> 02:51:18.149]  I was tired and lethargic.
[02:51:18.369 --> 02:51:25.653]  But after taking Heart and Body Extract, my energy level has improved greatly and I can now walk longer distances without getting tired so fast.
[02:51:25.673 --> 02:51:27.474]  Thank you, Heart and Body Extract.

[02:51:38.146 --> 02:51:40.888]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[02:51:41.208 --> 02:51:43.809]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[02:51:43.829 --> 02:51:44.250]  Croix River.
[02:51:44.570 --> 02:51:46.591]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[02:51:46.811 --> 02:51:49.533]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[02:51:49.773 --> 02:51:50.293]  His excuse?
[02:51:50.654 --> 02:51:51.714]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:51:51.974 --> 02:51:53.275]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[02:51:53.595 --> 02:51:59.099]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[02:52:08.345 --> 02:52:10.667]  Hi there, are you an unhappy timeshare owner?
[02:52:10.928 --> 02:52:13.891]  Have you ever asked yourself, how can I get rid of my timeshare?
[02:52:13.971 --> 02:52:16.954]  Does your story go something like Stacey's story goes?
[02:52:17.034 --> 02:52:17.895]  Here's Stacey now.
[02:52:18.035 --> 02:52:23.301]  My husband and I went and visited a resort and they kind of attacked us.
[02:52:23.701 --> 02:52:24.422]  We're good to go.

[02:54:04.653 --> 02:54:07.013]  From the Robert Allen System, current returns not indicative of future results.
[02:54:16.499 --> 02:54:20.401]  Folks, I know I get hysterical because I get so excited.
[02:54:20.722 --> 02:54:21.922]  I do the hardcore research.
[02:54:22.403 --> 02:54:23.963]  I look at the facts and then I take action.
[02:54:24.244 --> 02:54:31.168]  I'm gonna do five minutes the next hour to talk to Max and some of the callers like Dave and others that have been holding the longest.
[02:54:31.688 --> 02:54:33.329]  Then of course we have David Knight coming up.
[02:54:35.856 --> 02:54:42.482]  They have put glyphosate in the food and water by the... Folks, look up worldwide amount of glyphosate used since the 70s.
[02:54:42.522 --> 02:54:50.789]  I forget, it's something like... It's something like such and such million, billion tons, and I couldn't even believe the number when I've seen it on the news and stuff, so I don't want to get it wrong.
[02:54:52.630 --> 02:54:55.393]  And it's just designed to turn mammals off and give us cancer.
[02:54:55.453 --> 02:54:56.734]  It's designed to kill our guts.
[02:54:58.015 --> 02:55:03.179]  They're finding that farm animals are getting sick that eat corn and stuff raised with the Roundup.
[02:55:05.563 --> 02:55:09.447]  They won't give this stuff to show cattle and show horses, because they're not healthy.
[02:55:11.289 --> 02:55:16.194]  They won't give vaccines now, veterinarians to their own animals.
[02:55:17.536 --> 02:55:18.437]  Except maybe once.
[02:55:20.609 --> 02:55:23.110]  This is a revolution against this medical oppression.
[02:55:23.390 --> 02:55:25.931]  There are a lot of good things in Western medicine, but it's been taken over.
[02:55:26.751 --> 02:55:34.815]  And the fact is, every day I see top news admitting and coming out with the studies they already had, going, okay, you're right, it's true.
[02:55:36.235 --> 02:55:38.376]  What are the good ways to get probiotics?
[02:55:38.416 --> 02:55:39.597]  What do you think the best brands are?
[02:55:39.657 --> 02:55:41.678]  Obviously, you've been super neurotic.
[02:55:41.698 --> 02:55:43.279]  We've checked into it in a good way.
[02:55:43.819 --> 02:55:47.381]  You are coming out with stuff that people basically only get at medical clinics in Germany and stuff.
[02:55:47.701 --> 02:55:48.582]  Trying to bring it to the public.
[02:55:49.302 --> 02:55:53.484]  It's going to have ice bags with it and stuff when we ship it to people, but it's next level stuff.
[02:55:53.504 --> 02:55:56.806]  But separate from that, because I want to know, what's the best brands for me to take?
[02:55:56.846 --> 02:55:57.846]  I'm taking a couple different ones.
[02:55:57.867 --> 02:55:58.887]  I give them to the kids.
[02:56:00.028 --> 02:56:00.308]  And then
[02:56:00.908 --> 02:56:04.173]  What other foods are good to eat and then how important is the iodine in closing?
[02:56:04.393 --> 02:56:06.055]  Because, I mean, it really is the supercharger.
[02:56:06.806 --> 02:56:07.466]  Yeah, okay.
[02:56:07.486 --> 02:56:20.274]  So as far as the best probiotic to take, I mean, I spent seven years putting together the product that we currently have called Floratrex, and yours, the one that we're going to be coming out with, is even going to be better.
[02:56:20.294 --> 02:56:26.658]  It has 50 billion organisms that are alive inside the formula, and it's 18 different strains.
[02:56:26.698 --> 02:56:30.561]  We're going to add an additional six strains, and then we're also going to add that unique
[02:56:31.843 --> 02:56:34.644]  Those unique strains that we got from high up in the Himalayas.
[02:56:34.684 --> 02:56:36.044]  So that's available right now.
[02:56:36.144 --> 02:56:40.566]  You should have yours in stock probably, I'm hoping, in the next few months as well.
[02:56:41.826 --> 02:56:44.427]  And that's something everybody should take on a regular basis.
[02:56:44.827 --> 02:56:53.229]  As far as just getting good probiotics naturally, good organic raw foods, and then fermented foods, kombucha is great.
[02:56:53.349 --> 02:56:54.810]  Organic apple cider vinegar
[02:56:56.071 --> 02:56:59.195]  Any type of fermented food, yogurt.
[02:56:59.295 --> 02:57:07.405]  I do recommend that if you are going to take in any type of yogurt, cottage cheese, anything like that, that you use a certified organic source.
[02:57:08.877 --> 02:57:10.178]  And move forward with that.
[02:57:10.218 --> 02:57:15.819]  And as far as iodine is concerned, yes, it's all about teaching people how to heal themselves.
[02:57:15.999 --> 02:57:20.741]  And you can have one thing, and this is why the pharmaceutical companies will never be successful at this.
[02:57:21.041 --> 02:57:30.324]  Even though they're jumping on the bandwagon to do these probiotics, they're still not telling people to eliminate the high fructose corn syrup, to eliminate all the pesticide residue in their food.
[02:57:30.364 --> 02:57:34.766]  So they're going to take the probiotics and they're just going to be killed off by all the things that
[02:57:36.387 --> 02:57:40.971]  So stay away from the GMO, but bare minimum, you know, things like sauerkraut, kombucha.
[02:57:41.891 --> 02:57:43.133]  Let your kids eat dirt, folks.
[02:57:43.213 --> 02:57:44.634]  That's why kids that don't are so sick.
[02:57:44.954 --> 02:57:48.978]  Now, again, X2, nascent iodine, why is it the best form of iodine from our research?
[02:57:49.438 --> 02:57:50.479]  And why is it so important?
[02:57:50.499 --> 02:57:51.880]  And why did it make me lose so much weight?
[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:54.022]  Why did I get better suntans with it?
[02:57:54.062 --> 02:57:55.223]  You said that I thought you were crazy.
[02:57:55.543 --> 02:57:56.244]  What did it do to me?
[02:57:57.295 --> 02:58:06.619]  Well, first of all, every single person in the world right now has a hormone problem, and that means they have alterations in their estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, whatever.
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.841]  It's not like 5 out of 10 people have that.
[02:58:10.201 --> 02:58:16.044]  We all are being attacked, including me, on our endocrine glands, and those are your hormone-producing glands.
[02:58:16.864 --> 02:58:27.694]  Iodine is the number one mineral and nutrient that will help detoxify the fluoride, the chlorine, and the bromine, and it'll actually help repair your glandular tissue.
[02:58:27.774 --> 02:58:38.964]  So when you have a functioning endocrine system, which means your thyroid is functioning good, your gut is functioning well, you're able to break down foods, and everything is synergistically
[02:58:39.685 --> 02:58:43.410]  Combining to where you're healthy, you end up losing weight.
[02:58:43.430 --> 02:58:44.151]  Alright, we're out of time.
[02:58:44.171 --> 02:58:44.692]  Thank you.
[02:58:44.752 --> 02:58:45.673]  Fourth hour coming up.

[03:00:00.965 --> 03:00:05.169]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.255 --> 03:00:17.281]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:17.882 --> 03:00:20.864]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:32.102 --> 03:00:35.627]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live now in two.
[03:00:36.529 --> 03:00:38.271]  The fourth hour and five, six minutes.
[03:00:38.672 --> 03:00:39.814]  David Knight is coming up.
[03:00:40.334 --> 03:00:44.100]  I want to thank Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center for joining us earlier.
[03:00:44.120 --> 03:00:47.685]  Now I'm going to go ahead and take a few final calls here.
[03:00:49.581 --> 03:00:52.262]  But there is a new article up on InfoWars.com.
[03:00:52.582 --> 03:00:54.142]  This news came out a day ago.
[03:00:54.222 --> 03:01:04.604]  David Knight covered it on the Nightly News, but it was just buried in a headline that the private Federal Reserve employees and the Federal Reserve is endorsing Hillary and giving her the union money.
[03:01:05.664 --> 03:01:11.086]  Well, the real angle there is the Federal Reserve gave zero to Trump and gave money to Hillary and Cruz.
[03:01:11.646 --> 03:01:13.506]  Here's the headline, InfoWars.com.
[03:01:13.926 --> 03:01:17.687]  Federal Reserve funds Hillary and Cruz, but not Trump.
[03:01:21.161 --> 03:01:24.323]  Again, Federal Reserve funds Hillary and Cruz, but not Trump.
[03:01:24.703 --> 03:01:28.825]  Fed gives $18,000 to Clinton, $2,000 to Cruz, and $0 to Trump.
[03:01:29.746 --> 03:01:33.688]  Which is why everybody that supports Ron Paul should not support Donald Trump.
[03:01:36.529 --> 03:01:37.770]  No, you should support Donald Trump.
[03:01:39.070 --> 03:01:43.453]  The elite have now hit total, pulled their hair out, run around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[03:01:44.209 --> 03:01:45.149]  This is so obvious.
[03:01:45.870 --> 03:01:46.970]  Max in India.
[03:01:46.990 --> 03:01:47.471]  I didn't see that.
[03:01:47.491 --> 03:01:48.331]  I would have gone to you earlier.
[03:01:48.771 --> 03:01:50.992]  Max in the great subcontinent.
[03:01:51.252 --> 03:01:51.813]  You're on the air.
[03:01:51.833 --> 03:01:51.873]  Hi.
[03:01:53.693 --> 03:01:54.274]  Hello?
[03:01:54.514 --> 03:01:54.794]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:54.834 --> 03:01:55.274]  Go ahead.
[03:01:55.674 --> 03:01:55.874]  Hello.
[03:01:55.894 --> 03:01:56.275]  Can you hear me?
[03:01:56.555 --> 03:01:56.895]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:57.055 --> 03:01:57.355]  Yeah.
[03:01:57.415 --> 03:01:57.695]  Hi.
[03:01:57.775 --> 03:01:58.516]  It's good to talk to you.
[03:01:58.556 --> 03:01:59.756]  It's good to talk to you, Alex.
[03:02:00.036 --> 03:02:01.057]  I've been listening to you for many years.
[03:02:02.134 --> 03:02:02.594]  Sure.
[03:02:02.675 --> 03:02:02.815]  Sure.
[03:02:21.314 --> 03:02:21.995]  We're good to go.
[03:02:32.546 --> 03:02:36.570]  But the main guy who I studied and who I learned just about everything from was J. Edgar Griffin.
[03:02:37.071 --> 03:02:40.054]  And he's been on the program a few times and he's not been on for a few years now.
[03:02:40.094 --> 03:02:42.296]  So I'm going to... This is what I basically want to talk to you about.
[03:02:42.316 --> 03:02:44.859]  You know, I'm not going to spend... Yeah, I like getting J. Edgar Griffin on.
[03:02:44.899 --> 03:02:46.080]  He's a good guy and a friend.
[03:02:46.141 --> 03:02:49.144]  He's kind of retired, so you got to twist his arm to get him on.
[03:02:49.764 --> 03:02:51.706]  Let's get J. Edgar Griffin on this week or next week.
[03:02:53.369 --> 03:02:53.889]  Absolutely.
[03:02:53.949 --> 03:02:55.730]  The creature from Jekyll Island, a great guy.
[03:02:56.670 --> 03:02:58.371]  We should definitely get him on the broadcast.
[03:02:59.851 --> 03:03:02.652]  What do you think about people all over the world waking up to globalism?
[03:03:02.952 --> 03:03:11.414]  For me, it's just corporate colonialism and corporate exploitation blaming free market capitalism when really it's a form of monopoly.
[03:03:12.214 --> 03:03:15.195]  So India kicked out the colonialists.
[03:03:16.515 --> 03:03:18.596]  When will America kick out the globalists, Max?
[03:03:19.676 --> 03:03:20.096]  No, no, no.
[03:03:20.116 --> 03:03:20.996]  Listen, listen, listen, listen.
[03:03:21.016 --> 03:03:23.417]  We've got the same problem here that you guys have over there.
[03:03:23.697 --> 03:03:26.998]  And listen, I mean, I can't... Oh, I know they... I know Globalist came back.
[03:03:27.018 --> 03:03:29.679]  I mean, I know they came back, but it's just another form of the same thing.
[03:03:30.639 --> 03:03:32.000]  Well, it's just in political control.
[03:03:32.200 --> 03:03:34.360]  We have the false right and the false left.
[03:03:34.420 --> 03:03:35.140]  It's the same thing.
[03:03:35.160 --> 03:03:35.821]  It's the exact same thing.
[03:03:36.041 --> 03:03:37.101]  But my point is, you know what?
[03:03:37.725 --> 03:03:40.306]  In a way, it's a false left-right paradigm, but in a way, it's not.
[03:03:40.326 --> 03:03:42.266]  There is a real right versus left.
[03:03:42.326 --> 03:03:45.247]  It's individualism versus collectivism, and that's the key.
[03:03:45.287 --> 03:03:47.448]  You see, the point is we are in the middle of an ideological war here.
[03:03:47.928 --> 03:03:54.270]  The guys who are opposing us, the only way to beat them is to defeat them ideologically, because all they've got going for them is ideology.
[03:03:54.310 --> 03:03:55.410]  That's it.
[03:03:55.430 --> 03:03:55.710]  That's it.
[03:03:55.730 --> 03:03:56.691]  It's an info war.
[03:03:56.891 --> 03:03:57.951]  It is ideology.
[03:03:58.251 --> 03:04:02.372]  And that's why they want to shut our speech down worldwide, from Europe to India to the United States.
[03:04:02.793 --> 03:04:03.333]  God bless you.
[03:04:03.353 --> 03:04:04.273]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:04.333 --> 03:04:06.914]  And that's why I'm so opposed to Islam.
[03:04:07.934 --> 03:04:09.976]  I've had Arab friends, Muslim friends.
[03:04:10.416 --> 03:04:13.859]  Islam has had periods in its time when it was actually less barbaric than Europe.
[03:04:14.239 --> 03:04:14.840]  That's just a fact.
[03:04:14.920 --> 03:04:17.081]  It did have a couple hundred year period where it was a force for good.
[03:04:17.542 --> 03:04:19.643]  But radical Islam has basically taken Islam over.
[03:04:20.023 --> 03:04:22.005]  Just like radical left has taken the Democrats over.
[03:04:23.186 --> 03:04:24.707]  And it's a global program.
[03:04:24.767 --> 03:04:30.932]  And radical left is working with the megabanks and radical jihadists to bully everybody's free speech.
[03:04:30.972 --> 03:04:32.013]  And I'm not putting up with it.
[03:04:33.033 --> 03:04:34.675]  And we're going to defend Christianity.
[03:04:34.695 --> 03:04:36.076]  We're going to defend everybody else's religion.
[03:04:36.966 --> 03:04:40.369]  I mean, talk about India with what the Muslims do over there, bullying the Hindus and others.
[03:04:40.389 --> 03:04:41.170]  It's just out of control.
[03:04:41.190 --> 03:04:46.214]  And they try to brand it as racist that Trump is against radical Muslims coming in.
[03:04:46.634 --> 03:04:47.415]  India doesn't want them.
[03:04:47.475 --> 03:04:48.496]  Japan won't let them in.
[03:04:48.816 --> 03:04:51.458]  Not one Muslim's let into Japan for a reason.
[03:04:51.478 --> 03:04:52.379]  They're not putting up with it.
[03:04:53.271 --> 03:04:56.995]  Because Islam doesn't put up with other people's freedoms anymore.
[03:04:57.856 --> 03:04:58.517]  It's a tyranny.
[03:04:59.258 --> 03:05:00.239]  Hey, David Knight's coming up.
[03:05:00.279 --> 03:05:01.361]  I'm sure he'll take the calls.
[03:05:01.401 --> 03:05:02.762]  Michael, Dave, David, Blake and others.
[03:05:03.123 --> 03:05:04.825]  Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:05:05.045 --> 03:05:08.108]  I'll be on Facebook mentions after that at about 9, 10 with the primary.
[03:05:08.769 --> 03:05:18.658]  A 7-Eleven shopper in Washington State relied on his concealed carry firearm over the weekend to subdue a man who attacked customers and staff with a small axe.
[03:05:19.058 --> 03:05:20.339]  Just before 6 a.m.
[03:05:20.380 --> 03:05:31.489]  Sunday, a masked man entered a convenience store in Seattle and began swinging a hatchet at both customers and the store clerk before attacking the cashier, reports KOMO News.
[03:05:32.210 --> 03:05:39.516]  We don't know if the intent was to commit a robbery because the suspect didn't say anything, a King County Sheriff's Sergeant said.
[03:05:39.977 --> 03:05:46.162]  An armed store patron was sitting and having coffee at the exact moment the axe-wielding suspect entered.
[03:05:46.743 --> 03:05:54.830]  The 60-year-old man, who has reportedly visited the store nearly every day for the past 12 years, shot and killed the suspect.
[03:05:55.410 --> 03:06:01.193]  The store clerk, age 58, suffered a minor injury to his stomach and is expected to recover.
[03:06:01.753 --> 03:06:05.195]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[03:06:08.203 --> 03:06:09.084]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:06:09.164 --> 03:06:09.584]  Good, brother.
[03:06:09.745 --> 03:06:11.426]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:06:11.687 --> 03:06:13.248]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:06:13.408 --> 03:06:17.433]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:06:17.453 --> 03:06:20.015]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:06:20.055 --> 03:06:22.318]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:06:22.478 --> 03:06:30.406]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:06:30.666 --> 03:06:33.750]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[03:06:33.890 --> 03:06:35.392]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:06:35.432 --> 03:06:38.315]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[03:06:38.475 --> 03:06:39.837]  They've made a ton of money there.
[03:06:40.117 --> 03:06:45.483]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[03:06:45.583 --> 03:06:46.804]  We're good to go.

[03:08:21.514 --> 03:08:29.020]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:33.903]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:34.364 --> 03:08:38.126]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:08:38.527 --> 03:08:40.148]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:40.888 --> 03:08:42.249]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:42.289 --> 03:08:42.870]  I'm David Knight.
[03:08:42.910 --> 03:08:44.931]  On this Tuesday, March 15, 2016, of course today, we'll begin
[03:08:47.453 --> 03:08:49.255]  The winner-take-all primaries.
[03:08:49.295 --> 03:08:51.136]  We have five primaries today.
[03:08:51.897 --> 03:08:56.080]  They are going to be most of... winner-take-most, if not winner-take-all.
[03:08:56.100 --> 03:08:58.042]  The only one that's truly proportional is North Carolina.
[03:08:58.062 --> 03:09:00.564]  And of course, actually, I should say there are six contests.
[03:09:00.824 --> 03:09:02.505]  One of them has already taken place.
[03:09:02.986 --> 03:09:05.908]  And that is in the Northern Mariana Islands.
[03:09:06.548 --> 03:09:09.671]  Donald Trump won 73% of the vote there.
[03:09:10.271 --> 03:09:12.373]  He got all nine delegates.
[03:09:12.693 --> 03:09:14.655]  And it looks like it's going to be that type of night.
[03:09:15.196 --> 03:09:25.295]  Tonight, as well, the only state that appears to be, according to the early polls, the only state that appears to be in play, assuming that the ballots aren't going to be stuffed, and we'll talk about that.
[03:09:26.007 --> 03:09:29.869]  The only state that appears to be legitimately in play is Ohio.
[03:09:30.590 --> 03:09:40.516]  Now, they've made a big deal about the fact that this is Kasich's comeback, because it's not so much that Kasich is going up in the polls, but it's that Rubio is crashing and burning big time.
[03:09:41.437 --> 03:09:46.680]  If we were to look at this as a sporting contest, as I mentioned last night, this is kind of like the Final Four.
[03:09:46.700 --> 03:09:51.583]  You know, I'm from North Carolina, we always heard about the Final Four, March Madness, the NCAA Tournament.
[03:09:51.983 --> 03:09:54.105]  Imagine if you had four teams in the Final Four.
[03:09:55.017 --> 03:09:56.759]  And only one of them even had a winning record.
[03:09:56.779 --> 03:09:59.302]  Okay, that's what we've got tonight.
[03:09:59.722 --> 03:10:02.846]  Okay, 27 states territories so far.
[03:10:03.487 --> 03:10:05.589]  Kasich is 0 and 27.
[03:10:06.490 --> 03:10:09.133]  And we're supposed to take him seriously as a contender, okay?
[03:10:10.214 --> 03:10:19.041]  Even if he wins tonight in Ohio and loses the rest of these, he'll have a record of one win, 31 losses.
[03:10:19.582 --> 03:10:21.563]  One win and 31 losses.
[03:10:22.524 --> 03:10:29.110]  Only in the game of politics is that something that people can hold up with a straight face and say, well, we're going to continue to soldier on.
[03:10:29.850 --> 03:10:34.334]  Of course, when he was back in New Hampshire, remember, he invested a great deal of time in New Hampshire.
[03:10:35.577 --> 03:10:39.059]  Unlike Chris Christie, who spent a lot of time there and did not do well.
[03:10:39.099 --> 03:10:41.280]  He said, all right, this isn't the time for me.
[03:10:42.021 --> 03:10:43.021]  Kasich just kept going.
[03:10:43.161 --> 03:10:48.504]  And he had said to everybody, if I don't pull it out here with all the time and money that I've spent here in New Hampshire, it's over, folks.
[03:10:48.544 --> 03:10:50.105]  Well, it wasn't over for him.
[03:10:50.746 --> 03:10:54.748]  And now he thinks that he's, you're going to see if he wins Ohio tonight.
[03:10:56.016 --> 03:10:58.898]  Because he only has to win narrowly to get all the delegates.
[03:10:59.498 --> 03:11:06.383]  You are going to see all the ticker tape parades down Wall Street for him, through Fox News for him.
[03:11:06.643 --> 03:11:08.905]  They're going to be rolling out the red carpet there.
[03:11:08.945 --> 03:11:15.629]  You're going to see Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes blowing the trumpets alongside the red carpet for him.
[03:11:16.670 --> 03:11:18.071]  Let's take a look at these other guys, okay?
[03:11:18.091 --> 03:11:21.133]  You got Rubio, 3 and 24 record, okay?
[03:11:21.173 --> 03:11:23.195]  Plus he won District of Columbia.
[03:11:23.215 --> 03:11:24.936]  Of course he would win the District of Columbia.
[03:11:25.417 --> 03:11:26.505]  All the statists, okay?
[03:11:27.426 --> 03:11:37.188]  Rubio is going to have to do major ballot stuffing and all kinds of games in Florida just to save enough face so that he doesn't have a career-ending embarrassment.
[03:11:37.928 --> 03:11:39.408]  That's what he's got in front of him.
[03:11:39.748 --> 03:11:41.128]  Is he going to be so embarrassed?
[03:11:41.148 --> 03:11:41.889]  That's the question tonight.
[03:11:41.989 --> 03:11:44.049]  Is Rubio going to be so embarrassed?
[03:11:44.089 --> 03:11:50.570]  Is he going to get a third or fourth place finish in Florida so that that's essentially the end of his career?
[03:11:51.050 --> 03:11:55.991]  It's not a height issue, it's a stature issue, and he's lost his stature.
[03:11:56.511 --> 03:11:57.872]  Then you've got Ted Cruz.
[03:11:58.312 --> 03:12:00.533]  Now, here's the real contender, we're told.
[03:12:01.033 --> 03:12:03.974]  Okay, he's got a win-loss record of 8-18.
[03:12:04.375 --> 03:12:05.715]  Okay, 8-18.
[03:12:06.636 --> 03:12:08.136]  Now, what's going to happen after tonight?
[03:12:08.176 --> 03:12:14.439]  Let's look at the delegate counts, because it's not just the, up to this point, the delegates have been awarded proportionally.
[03:12:14.499 --> 03:12:17.560]  Some of them will still be awarded proportionally after tonight to some degree.
[03:12:18.221 --> 03:12:22.963]  And of course, even when the delegates were awarded proportionally in South Carolina,
[03:12:24.011 --> 03:12:27.152]  Donald Trump got all 50 delegates in South Carolina.
[03:12:27.652 --> 03:12:28.352]  They awarded them.
[03:12:28.793 --> 03:12:32.574]  It was a winner-take-all by each congressional district.
[03:12:32.994 --> 03:12:36.115]  And Donald Trump won all of the delegates in South Carolina.
[03:12:36.195 --> 03:12:37.496]  And of course, that could happen tonight.
[03:12:37.536 --> 03:12:41.277]  The states that we really need to look at are going to be Illinois and Missouri.
[03:12:41.357 --> 03:12:45.158]  Those will really determine which path we are on.
[03:12:45.238 --> 03:12:46.939]  Tonight is a fork in the road.
[03:12:47.739 --> 03:12:57.257]  And the question is, do we move down the road where the voters have a say, or are we going to take the fork in the road where the establishment
[03:12:59.478 --> 03:13:02.840]  That's really what we're looking at tonight.
[03:13:03.440 --> 03:13:14.147]  Because tonight, depending on how this goes, Donald Trump could sock it away or put himself so far out in front that it is essentially mathematically impossible for the other guys to catch him.
[03:13:14.167 --> 03:13:16.209]  Let me explain how this works tonight, for example.
[03:13:16.909 --> 03:13:23.713]  If John Kasich were to win Ohio tonight and get the 60 or so delegates that are there,
[03:13:24.983 --> 03:13:32.065]  He would still need, after tonight, because he's going to lose these other states, and that's going to be 358 delegates.
[03:13:32.145 --> 03:13:36.906]  That's one-third of the delegates needed to win the GOP nomination going to be awarded tonight.
[03:13:38.007 --> 03:13:41.848]  And he's only going to get one state of those, about 60 delegates or so.
[03:13:42.808 --> 03:13:50.630]  He would need to get, John Kasich would need to get, 106% of the delegates moving forward in order to legitimately win the
[03:13:51.713 --> 03:13:52.474]  Uh, nomination.
[03:13:52.494 --> 03:13:55.837]  Of course, he's not looking to legitimately win the nomination.
[03:13:55.897 --> 03:14:01.962]  He's looking for people like Mitt Romney to coronate him at a crooked convention.
[03:14:02.542 --> 03:14:04.224]  You know, I talked about the sports analogy.
[03:14:04.264 --> 03:14:10.449]  You know, what if we had a Final Four, only one team has a winning record, and they say, yeah, but you know what?
[03:14:10.709 --> 03:14:12.391]  All these games up to this point, they don't count.
[03:14:12.471 --> 03:14:13.492]  You know, just like little kids do.
[03:14:13.952 --> 03:14:14.834]  That's what my son said.
[03:14:15.074 --> 03:14:16.316]  This is like what the little kids do.
[03:14:16.376 --> 03:14:17.577]  Alright, it doesn't matter.
[03:14:17.597 --> 03:14:19.820]  We're going to wipe out all these other contests and everything.
[03:14:20.121 --> 03:14:23.345]  And only this last one, we're going to have a sudden death contest.
[03:14:23.726 --> 03:14:24.727]  Sudden death overtime.
[03:14:24.767 --> 03:14:26.429]  That's what the convention that they want will be.
[03:14:27.090 --> 03:14:30.755]  Sudden death overtime and the league, which doesn't like this winning team,
[03:14:31.696 --> 03:14:39.764]  And the referees are going to conspire together to throw the flags, to change the rules, to make sure that somebody they pick wins.
[03:14:40.184 --> 03:14:45.809]  That's what we're looking at moving forward from here if this doesn't work out tonight, if this is a crash and burn.
[03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:49.033]  But nobody expects that to happen unless there's massive fraud.
[03:14:49.093 --> 03:14:52.055]  And there's evidence that there is a lot of fraud in Florida.
[03:14:52.496 --> 03:14:53.076]  What a surprise.
[03:14:53.957 --> 03:14:58.480]  What a surprise that there would be fraud in Florida and the Republicans.
[03:14:59.261 --> 03:15:00.642]  Let's look at the situation tonight.
[03:15:01.142 --> 03:15:06.045]  As FiveThirtyEight points out, if Trump were to win, Florida, Illinois, Missouri, and Ohio.
[03:15:06.826 --> 03:15:09.928]  Moving forward, he would only need to pick up 44% of the remaining delegates.
[03:15:10.848 --> 03:15:12.670]  That's a really low bar.
[03:15:13.810 --> 03:15:16.212]  What if he loses Ohio but wins these other states?
[03:15:16.292 --> 03:15:17.873]  Wins Florida, Illinois, Missouri?
[03:15:18.253 --> 03:15:19.094]  He would still only need 50%.
[03:15:19.134 --> 03:15:19.294]  What if
[03:15:22.830 --> 03:15:26.251]  Well, and we're not even looking at Ted Cruz winning any states.
[03:15:26.292 --> 03:15:28.512]  He might get some delegates tonight from North Carolina.
[03:15:29.253 --> 03:15:36.196]  But if he doesn't win any delegates tonight, then of course that's not going to be the case, but we don't know how that's going to be split in North Carolina.
[03:15:36.256 --> 03:15:42.999]  But he would need, moving forward, Ted Cruz needs 83% of the delegates remaining to win.
[03:15:43.019 --> 03:15:44.759]  Do you see how this is looking?
[03:15:44.779 --> 03:15:50.242]  Do you see how ridiculous it is that the establishment continues to push this idea
[03:15:50.922 --> 03:15:54.945]  That they're going to, that we really got a contest still going on here?
[03:15:55.525 --> 03:15:57.447]  We got a contest because of things like this.
[03:15:58.067 --> 03:16:02.871]  We got reports, Gateway Pundit, this is on Drudge Report, Trump left off of some Florida ballots.
[03:16:04.124 --> 03:16:05.545]  They left him off the ballots?
[03:16:06.665 --> 03:16:08.446]  Alex Jones talked about that earlier in the show.
[03:16:08.826 --> 03:16:11.667]  We've got other places in Florida that ran out of the ballots.
[03:16:11.747 --> 03:16:17.590]  I guess they had a lot of pre-stuffing going on and so they've run out of ballots in Apopka, Florida.
[03:16:18.671 --> 03:16:21.872]  Several Orange County locations, they've run out of Republican ballots.
[03:16:22.112 --> 03:16:23.413]  That tells you two things, folks.
[03:16:24.053 --> 03:16:33.778]  It tells you that being Florida, the first thing I would expect is that there's fraud going on, but we know that there has been record voting going on everywhere.
[03:16:33.878 --> 03:16:34.519]  Because of who?
[03:16:35.475 --> 03:16:36.015]  Donald Trump.
[03:16:36.275 --> 03:16:37.936]  It's not going on because of John Kasich.
[03:16:37.996 --> 03:16:40.776]  It's not going on because of Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz.
[03:16:41.397 --> 03:16:43.837]  The record voting is because of Donald Trump.
[03:16:44.417 --> 03:16:53.380]  And we're seeing massive movement of people moving from independent and from Democrat to voting in these primaries when they're allowed to.
[03:16:53.400 --> 03:16:58.501]  That's why the only places that Ted Cruz has won are the closed caucuses
[03:16:59.431 --> 03:17:04.589]  We're only people who have registered in advance as Republicans are allowed to vote and he's allowed to go in and...
[03:17:06.132 --> 03:17:10.814]  Work his magic like he did in Iowa, telling people that Ben Carson was going to be dropping out.
[03:17:11.095 --> 03:17:14.476]  That's the kind of candidate that Ted Cruz is.
[03:17:14.856 --> 03:17:16.237]  Also, I thought this was very interesting.
[03:17:16.677 --> 03:17:19.919]  We see Trump breaking 50% for the first time in national polls.
[03:17:20.719 --> 03:17:24.601]  Remember, Karl Rove started this meme back in November.
[03:17:24.621 --> 03:17:26.442]  And he said, okay, fine, fine.
[03:17:26.522 --> 03:17:30.324]  Trump is in first place, but he only gets 30%, 40%, everywhere you go.
[03:17:30.704 --> 03:17:31.945]  He's got a ceiling of 30 to 40%.
[03:17:32.465 --> 03:17:35.287]  It's like, well, you know, the problem with that, Karl,
[03:17:36.007 --> 03:17:44.389]  And I've mentioned this many times, is that by the same logic, the candidates that you support, like Ted Cruz, have a ceiling of 20%.
[03:17:46.249 --> 03:17:46.530]  Okay?
[03:17:46.570 --> 03:17:47.470]  They don't ever say that.
[03:17:47.910 --> 03:17:55.012]  The assumption is that all these candidates are going to coalesce behind one of the establishment's favorites.
[03:17:55.492 --> 03:17:56.292]  That hasn't happened.
[03:17:56.492 --> 03:17:58.292]  It isn't going to happen.
[03:17:58.692 --> 03:18:00.373]  People understand what is going on.
[03:18:01.394 --> 03:18:02.735]  There is a massive move.
[03:18:02.775 --> 03:18:08.281]  People understand, as Pat Caddell points out, the American people figured out they're being screwed.
[03:18:08.861 --> 03:18:10.243]  They're being screwed by the establishment.
[03:18:10.263 --> 03:18:12.285]  They're being screwed by these trade deals.
[03:18:12.905 --> 03:18:13.306]  And here's
[03:18:14.688 --> 03:18:18.511]  One way to look at this, the establishment knows who the outsider is.
[03:18:18.531 --> 03:18:21.613]  Look at the story that Kit Daniels just put up on Infowars.com.
[03:18:21.633 --> 03:18:26.136]  The Federal Reserve funds Hillary and Cruz, but not Trump.
[03:18:26.636 --> 03:18:29.058]  Now these are donations from Federal Reserve employees.
[03:18:29.498 --> 03:18:41.287]  Federal Reserve employees have given $18,000 to Hillary Clinton, $2,000 to Ted Cruz, which is the most they've given to any Republican candidate, and not a cent to Donald Trump.
[03:18:42.242 --> 03:18:44.809]  And that's coming from Federal Election Commission data.
[03:18:45.859 --> 03:18:49.822]  Donald Trump had pointed out back in February, he says, it's very important to audit the Fed.
[03:18:49.862 --> 03:18:52.704]  It's too bad that Ted Cruz missed the vote on Audit the Fed.
[03:18:52.744 --> 03:19:00.050]  Look, the Federal Reserve employees understand that Ted Cruz is no threat to their future employment.
[03:19:00.530 --> 03:19:03.533]  It is going to be business as usual with the Federal Reserve.
[03:19:03.613 --> 03:19:13.080]  It will be business as usual with the IRS, with the rest of the bureaucracy, if Ted Cruz is getting in there, notwithstanding all of the speeches that he's made.
[03:19:14.201 --> 03:19:24.252]  There were articles in the National Review back in December criticizing Ted Cruz for repeating the phrase neocon, labeling all these people as neocons.
[03:19:24.272 --> 03:19:24.793]  And you know what?
[03:19:24.873 --> 03:19:31.901]  The very people that he was labeling as neocons in December are now his inner circle of advisors on foreign policy.
[03:19:32.878 --> 03:19:34.679]  They said, you're calling us warmongers.
[03:19:34.719 --> 03:19:35.319]  Yeah, they were.
[03:19:35.419 --> 03:19:36.920]  People like John Bolton and others.
[03:19:37.320 --> 03:19:42.142]  You're calling us warmongers and you're using this phrase neocon.
[03:19:42.182 --> 03:19:43.183]  It's a pejorative.
[03:19:43.283 --> 03:19:46.024]  It's a dog whistle to your base.
[03:19:46.544 --> 03:19:48.245]  That's precisely the point.
[03:19:48.705 --> 03:19:50.186]  That's what Ted Cruz does.
[03:19:50.426 --> 03:19:51.646]  He does the data mining.
[03:19:51.866 --> 03:19:53.347]  He throws out the dog whistles.
[03:19:53.387 --> 03:19:55.348]  He climbs over the back of his colleagues.
[03:19:55.828 --> 03:19:59.149]  To show himself as an outsider when he's the ultimate insider.
[03:19:59.389 --> 03:20:04.110]  He now has these people as his supporters, as his campaign donations.
[03:20:04.490 --> 03:20:08.671]  The Jebs and the Bushes are pulling in behind Ted Cruz.
[03:20:08.691 --> 03:20:09.471]  Davis will be right back.
[03:20:09.491 --> 03:20:11.392]  Are you an unhappy timeshare owner?
[03:20:11.652 --> 03:20:14.593]  Have you ever asked yourself, how can I get rid of my timeshare?
[03:20:14.613 --> 03:20:17.673]  Does your story go something like Stacey's story goes?
[03:20:17.753 --> 03:20:18.614]  Here's Stacey now.
[03:20:18.754 --> 03:20:24.255]  My husband and I went and visited a resort and they kind of attacked us.
[03:20:24.435 --> 03:20:25.176]  We're good to go.
[03:20:48.174 --> 03:20:51.377]  To cancel your timeshare contract, call ACC today.

[03:24:16.795 --> 03:24:18.316]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:18.356 --> 03:24:22.278]  I'm David Knight, your host, and we're just talking about the fork in the road tonight.
[03:24:22.298 --> 03:24:32.083]  This is a major decision tonight, whether or not we are going to go down a crooked path to a rigged convention, or whether or not the votes of the American people are really going to count.
[03:24:33.206 --> 03:24:34.486]  What is this election about?
[03:24:35.267 --> 03:24:39.488]  I think we can get a perspective on this sometimes by looking outside of ourselves.
[03:24:40.068 --> 03:24:42.228]  Let's take a look at this Brexit debate.
[03:24:42.989 --> 03:24:44.889]  Will Britain exit the EU?
[03:24:45.429 --> 03:24:53.951]  And of course this entered into the American news simply because there was a back and forth between Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, and Barack Obama.
[03:24:54.592 --> 03:24:59.753]  Basically then Boris Johnson told Obama to butt out of their internal politics.
[03:25:00.573 --> 03:25:02.735]  And he had some interesting things to say.
[03:25:02.795 --> 03:25:06.979]  He said, of all the exorbitant hypocrisy for the U.S.
[03:25:07.079 --> 03:25:11.604]  to urge Britain to stay in the EU, given that the U.S.
[03:25:11.664 --> 03:25:15.788]  defends its own sovereignty with hysterical vigilance, I wish we did.
[03:25:16.650 --> 03:25:17.550]  We're about to do that.
[03:25:18.150 --> 03:25:23.392]  If we get Trump in as president, we're going to defend our own sovereignty with hysterical vigilance.
[03:25:23.772 --> 03:25:29.314]  And I would point out that extremism in defense of liberty is no vice, okay?
[03:25:29.414 --> 03:25:32.394]  Moderation in pursuit of justice is no virtue either.
[03:25:33.635 --> 03:25:43.177]  Now he points out, he said, with NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is put in this article here that's out of Britain, they put it as the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement.
[03:25:43.217 --> 03:25:44.898]  No, it's the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[03:25:45.666 --> 03:25:47.267]  Which comprises US, Canada, and Mexico.
[03:25:47.327 --> 03:25:52.210]  He says it doesn't come with a commission, a parliament, or a court of justice, he pointed out.
[03:25:52.991 --> 03:25:53.551]  Well, not yet.
[03:25:54.292 --> 03:25:54.652]  Not yet.
[03:25:55.152 --> 03:25:56.853]  That's why we talk about the North American Union.
[03:25:57.214 --> 03:26:09.322]  And we need to understand that when we look at these trade agreements, when we look at all these agreements, and we look at what the situation is in Europe, the EU does have a commission, a parliament, a court of justice.
[03:26:10.202 --> 03:26:11.503]  That is the problem.
[03:26:12.063 --> 03:26:14.005]  See, they started out as an economic union.
[03:26:14.960 --> 03:26:17.863]  What they did then was they made it into a political union.
[03:26:18.504 --> 03:26:28.155]  And they want to make it into a tighter political union because they have rigged the system to fail using the economic levers that they were given by that economic union.
[03:26:28.175 --> 03:26:29.276]  Do you understand how this works?
[03:26:29.957 --> 03:26:31.198]  That's the process.
[03:26:32.230 --> 03:26:43.856]  They create these trade areas, consolidation, they consolidate several countries together into an economic union, which doesn't work out very well for the countries that were rich.
[03:26:44.376 --> 03:26:55.622]  It's a transfer of wealth, it's a transfer of sovereignty, ultimately, because they're going to rig the system so that as it fails, they say, as they're saying now in Europe, the only way that we're going to save the euro
[03:26:56.806 --> 03:27:02.729]  The only way we're going to save this euro is to have tighter political controls.
[03:27:03.290 --> 03:27:06.631]  That's why there's this move in Britain to say we're going to back out of this.
[03:27:06.751 --> 03:27:25.342]  And you have to understand, Jeff Sessions, Senator Sessions, who looked at these new trade agreements that will unify the United States with a block of Asian countries, that will unify the United States with Europe, that is the globalist trade agreement, with the United States as the backbone with these two trade agreements.
[03:27:26.448 --> 03:27:31.191]  Both of these trade agreements have been negotiated at the same time, by the same people, in secret.
[03:27:31.532 --> 03:27:33.313]  They have the same structure.
[03:27:33.833 --> 03:27:41.259]  That structure sets up an international trade commission that is not answerable or controllable by our governments.
[03:27:42.199 --> 03:27:46.082]  It is an international commission that will manage our economies.
[03:27:46.102 --> 03:27:53.107]  We're not talking about free trade here, we're talking about foreign management of our economies by an unelected elite commission.
[03:27:54.127 --> 03:27:55.908]  That's what Senator Sessions has pointed out.
[03:27:56.329 --> 03:27:58.751]  The only person who cares about that is Donald Trump.
[03:27:58.771 --> 03:28:01.333]  That's why Senator Sessions endorsed Donald Trump.
[03:28:01.353 --> 03:28:06.036]  The only presidential candidate Senator Sessions has ever endorsed.
[03:28:07.317 --> 03:28:09.879]  That is a major reason to vote for Donald Trump.
[03:28:10.079 --> 03:28:11.600]  He is authentic on this issue.
[03:28:11.640 --> 03:28:13.682]  He's pushed on this issue for 35 years.
[03:28:15.600 --> 03:28:16.681]  I trust him on this issue.
[03:28:16.721 --> 03:28:18.822]  I don't trust him on individual liberty.
[03:28:19.202 --> 03:28:20.822]  I don't trust him on so many other things.
[03:28:20.883 --> 03:28:24.304]  But there are ways that we can control these issues.
[03:28:24.664 --> 03:28:28.206]  Not everything will be accomplished by electing somebody as president.
[03:28:28.226 --> 03:28:29.126]  You have to understand that.
[03:28:29.787 --> 03:28:36.230]  That's one of the reasons why evangelicals are not falling in line behind the public piety of Ted Cruz.
[03:28:36.290 --> 03:28:39.251]  First of all, most of them, like me, don't believe that it's authentic.
[03:28:39.831 --> 03:28:40.632]  Looks like a stench.
[03:28:42.025 --> 03:28:47.754]  But they also understand that's not the jurisdiction of government.
[03:28:47.914 --> 03:28:49.256]  Government has failed.
[03:28:49.536 --> 03:28:51.880]  We have tried that since the days of Reagan.
[03:28:52.281 --> 03:28:56.066]  And all it has done is make the Christian churches weaker.
[03:28:57.017 --> 03:29:08.511]  It has made a lot of glitterbug preachers very wealthy by positioning themselves into the political arena, but it has not done much for the spiritual health of this country.
[03:29:08.551 --> 03:29:10.954]  We understand it is a failed practice.
[03:29:11.274 --> 03:29:14.117]  And so when we look at this, when we look at this from an international standpoint,
[03:29:14.838 --> 03:29:16.360]  Look at what's happening in Europe.
[03:29:17.041 --> 03:29:19.144]  Same people, same tactics.
[03:29:19.184 --> 03:29:20.626]  That's why they have the open borders.
[03:29:20.706 --> 03:29:28.757]  It's a different group of immigrants going in there, to some degree, but it's the same globalists who are doing to Europe what they want to do to America.
[03:29:28.918 --> 03:29:31.621]  Europe is just a little bit farther along than we are.
[03:29:32.142 --> 03:29:34.624]  And of course there's this article that was on Drudge Report today.
[03:29:35.205 --> 03:29:37.547]  Unprecedented UN global data gathering.
[03:29:37.587 --> 03:29:40.970]  Yeah, the UN Statistical Commission wants to get all kinds of stuff.
[03:29:40.990 --> 03:29:44.313]  They have targets in order to transform global society.
[03:29:44.613 --> 03:29:46.955]  This is the globalism that is there.
[03:29:46.995 --> 03:29:51.940]  When you look at what they're doing, they're feeding this agenda that we see here in the United States as well.
[03:29:51.960 --> 03:29:54.362]  Stay with us, we're going to come back and break this down for you further.
[03:29:57.764 --> 03:30:00.754]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:30:01.697 --> 03:30:04.386]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:08.627 --> 03:30:13.971]  In a rather bizarre statement, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has said that the U.S.
[03:30:14.011 --> 03:30:22.458]  didn't lose a single person in Libya, which is to say the former Secretary of State is ignoring the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
[03:30:22.779 --> 03:30:24.860]  Now, Libya is perfect, isn't it?
[03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:25.661]  Clinton said.
[03:30:26.061 --> 03:30:30.245]  Libya was a different kind of calculation, and we didn't lose a single person.
[03:30:30.485 --> 03:30:35.349]  We didn't have a problem in supporting our European and Arab allies in working with NATO.
[03:30:35.709 --> 03:30:44.491]  Mrs. Clinton conveniently skipped over the attack of September 11th, 2012 on the diplomatic special mission compound in CIA Annex in Benghazi.
[03:30:44.691 --> 03:30:53.013]  The left ambassador Christopher Stevens, foreign management officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Smith and Glenn Doherty dead.
[03:30:53.213 --> 03:30:55.833]  There's even a movie out about it called 13 Hours.
[03:30:56.273 --> 03:31:01.334]  And this isn't the first time Hillary has had a selective memory, but what difference does it make?
[03:31:01.594 --> 03:31:05.155]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[03:31:08.325 --> 03:31:11.527]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:11.847 --> 03:31:19.852]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:20.092 --> 03:31:25.116]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:31:25.496 --> 03:31:27.797]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[03:31:28.037 --> 03:31:29.819]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[03:31:40.933 --> 03:31:44.855]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.
[03:31:44.995 --> 03:31:49.618]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[03:31:49.818 --> 03:31:56.742]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[03:32:09.384 --> 03:32:12.807]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:32:13.167 --> 03:32:20.292]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:32:20.892 --> 03:32:29.238]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:32:29.538 --> 03:32:36.123]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water,
[03:32:36.403 --> 03:32:43.368]  To the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:32:43.768 --> 03:32:46.871]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:32:47.171 --> 03:32:58.219]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:32:58.319 --> 03:33:00.963]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[03:33:01.204 --> 03:33:04.149]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[03:33:04.309 --> 03:33:06.953]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[03:33:21.061 --> 03:33:26.165]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:33:26.706 --> 03:33:28.948]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.750 --> 03:33:32.711]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.751 --> 03:33:36.252]  I'm David Knight, and I want to talk to Owen in FEMA 7.
[03:33:36.973 --> 03:33:40.074]  He says he was at the Trump rally in Chicago this last weekend.
[03:33:40.094 --> 03:33:42.095]  I want to get his first-hand take on that.
[03:33:42.135 --> 03:33:43.115]  So hang on there, Owen.
[03:33:43.375 --> 03:33:44.516]  I'm going to come to you in just a moment.
[03:33:45.256 --> 03:33:53.039]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know that we do have Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine back in stock, and of course there's been a lot of news the last couple of days.
[03:33:53.580 --> 03:33:58.482]  The mainstream medical community has said what we've been saying for 20 years.
[03:33:59.522 --> 03:34:06.452]  That the essence of your health in terms of fighting cancer with your immune system is the health of your gut.
[03:34:06.512 --> 03:34:09.236]  That's what Dr. Group and InfoWars have been telling you for 20 years.
[03:34:09.716 --> 03:34:10.437]  Now they're admitting it.
[03:34:10.838 --> 03:34:14.343]  And of course in that article the guy says, five years ago I would have said, what are you crazy?
[03:34:15.484 --> 03:34:18.666]  Because they were saying, hey, you're crazy, but we knew better.
[03:34:18.866 --> 03:34:19.166]  OK?
[03:34:19.727 --> 03:34:22.929]  So now the AMA and others have looked at research.
[03:34:22.969 --> 03:34:23.949]  They understand that now.
[03:34:24.530 --> 03:34:28.372]  Iodine, of course, helps your gut to promote optimal health.
[03:34:29.072 --> 03:34:31.534]  They've taken it out of the food supply, a large degree.
[03:34:31.754 --> 03:34:32.715]  We've talked about that.
[03:34:32.775 --> 03:34:34.836]  We've seen a drop in IQ points.
[03:34:36.617 --> 03:34:41.759]  And when we saw populations gain in IQ points when it was added back in salt in the 1990s.
[03:34:42.020 --> 03:34:45.321]  Let me read you some of the reviews that are on Infowarslife.com.
[03:34:45.461 --> 03:34:49.643]  Of course, this is a great place for you to look also and do your research.
[03:34:49.683 --> 03:34:55.466]  Here's Doug from Prince George, British Columbia says, nascent iodine was my first step back into healthy living.
[03:34:55.826 --> 03:35:00.068]  I'd lived very unhealthy for about seven years, eating a lot of processed food because of convenience.
[03:35:00.488 --> 03:35:02.669]  What a great product to clean your system.
[03:35:03.129 --> 03:35:05.331]  Here's another one from Rob in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[03:35:05.371 --> 03:35:06.872]  He says, I cannot go without this.
[03:35:06.912 --> 03:35:08.953]  Every day I use it, I can notice a difference.
[03:35:08.973 --> 03:35:10.414]  When I don't take it, I feel sluggish.
[03:35:10.814 --> 03:35:15.218]  I have increased vitality, and I know it's helping to fight off all the toxins around me.
[03:35:15.278 --> 03:35:17.719]  Right now, nascent iodine is in stock.
[03:35:17.759 --> 03:35:20.161]  You can find that at infowarslife.com.
[03:35:20.281 --> 03:35:22.643]  And also, make sure you never run out of stock.
[03:35:23.223 --> 03:35:25.745]  Sign up for the products that you use with AutoShip.
[03:35:26.185 --> 03:35:38.334]  That helps us to know what our demand is, to better manage inventory, and we like to make everything a win-win solution, so we give you a 10% discount when you set up on an AutoShip interval there.
[03:35:38.374 --> 03:35:44.619]  You choose the interval that you want to have these products, which products you want sent to you, at what time intervals, and we give you a 10% discount.
[03:35:44.639 --> 03:35:45.339]  I mean, what could be better?
[03:35:45.579 --> 03:35:47.741]  You never run out of stock, and you always get a 10% discount.
[03:35:49.142 --> 03:35:53.286]  Now I want to go to Owen in FEMA7 to kind of give you a little bit of background here.
[03:35:53.306 --> 03:35:59.612]  There's a couple interesting articles that came out today about what happened this last Saturday in Chicago.
[03:35:59.672 --> 03:36:00.713]  Is it Saturday or Friday night?
[03:36:01.734 --> 03:36:06.758]  Anyway, a new poll shows that left-wing protesters drive people in the arms of Donald Trump.
[03:36:06.778 --> 03:36:08.680]  This is an article that's up on Infowars.com.
[03:36:08.700 --> 03:36:12.284]  It's actually from Reason Magazine, and they're looking at a poll from Monmouth University.
[03:36:12.944 --> 03:36:22.875]  And the Reason writer says it confirms something I've long suspected and have argued in previous articles that the antics of left-wing agitators are driving ordinary people into the arms of Trump.
[03:36:23.316 --> 03:36:26.159]  And then we have this other article that's up on Infowars.com.
[03:36:26.199 --> 03:36:28.261]  A Chicago cop posted after the fact.
[03:36:28.661 --> 03:36:32.606]  The anti-Trump mob was far more aggressive and destructive than reported.
[03:36:32.826 --> 03:36:34.128]  He says it seems like the media
[03:36:34.628 --> 03:36:43.310]  Imagine that, the media aren't broadcasting footage of the debris being thrown across various streets at Trump fans, at the Trump fans.
[03:36:43.350 --> 03:37:00.555]  The officer who posted anonymously on Second City Cop blog also noted the media didn't report the protesters running through parking lots, breaking the windows of cars that had Trump stickers on them, or that the department called out emergency incident teams to cope with anti-Trump riots at the University of Illinois in Chicago.
[03:37:00.595 --> 03:37:02.576]  Later the same day, the officer posted a second
[03:37:02.956 --> 03:37:09.643]  Much longer post to detail the failures of the police leaders to plan for to respond to the protests.
[03:37:09.703 --> 03:37:16.470]  And of course, you've got Ted Cruz jumping in with the rest of the establishment GOP saying Trump is responsible.
[03:37:16.850 --> 03:37:17.691]  Let's blame Trump.
[03:37:17.731 --> 03:37:20.354]  You know, we had riots this last weekend as well.
[03:37:20.414 --> 03:37:22.636]  Spring break riots in Miami's South Beach.
[03:37:23.197 --> 03:37:24.498]  Was that Donald Trump's fault too?
[03:37:25.299 --> 03:37:33.401]  I'm sure if Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, and Karl Rove knew about it, they would try to blame that on Donald Trump as well.
[03:37:33.421 --> 03:37:34.281]  I had people there.
[03:37:34.802 --> 03:37:41.703]  What was a possible justification for them to create a brawl, to climb on top of cars, to break bottles all over the place?
[03:37:41.743 --> 03:37:43.664]  They had to call out the riot police there.
[03:37:43.704 --> 03:37:45.084]  They said it wasn't a full-on riot.
[03:37:45.465 --> 03:37:48.965]  Nevertheless, it was chaos, reported by CBS News.
[03:37:49.286 --> 03:37:51.046]  And here's what a resident there said.
[03:37:51.386 --> 03:37:54.407]  This is Mara De Los Angeles, a Miami Beach resident.
[03:37:54.807 --> 03:37:57.508]  According to Ted Cruz, I'm sure it was Donald Trump's fault.
[03:37:57.548 --> 03:37:59.149]  Let's go to Owen in FEMA7.
[03:37:59.169 --> 03:38:01.730]  Owen, you were there at the Chicago Trump rally?
[03:38:02.391 --> 03:38:03.991]  Hey David, nasodiodine user, and I want to clarify.
[03:38:04.191 --> 03:38:05.232]  Actually, I was at the St.
[03:38:05.252 --> 03:38:05.692]  Louis rally.
[03:38:05.712 --> 03:38:06.292]  Oh, okay.
[03:38:23.007 --> 03:38:28.369]  I am actually the guy in the plaid shirt on the anti-Trump protesters go berserk video.
[03:38:28.929 --> 03:38:29.610]  Oh, okay.
[03:38:30.390 --> 03:38:45.496]  I wanted to, well first off, I wanted to say thank you for all the support on the video and unfortunately for the people that were asking who I am or where they can find me, I was blocked from Google Plus and YouTube here lately so I haven't been able to comment or share my page or anything.
[03:38:45.905 --> 03:38:47.686]  Well, there you go.
[03:38:47.826 --> 03:38:49.827]  That's the response of the mainstream.
[03:38:50.207 --> 03:38:55.010]  If they don't get the optics that they want, if they don't get the story that they want, they just shut it down.
[03:38:55.150 --> 03:38:57.111]  So they've blocked you from Google+.
[03:38:58.492 --> 03:39:04.375]  Yes, and I haven't been able to do my live show, but I have been able to upload videos from my phone, but that's it.
[03:39:04.415 --> 03:39:05.416]  No comments or anything else.
[03:39:05.456 --> 03:39:07.237]  But I do think that the St.
[03:39:07.277 --> 03:39:12.900]  Louis rally actually illustrates what you were just talking about just as much, if not more,
[03:39:13.513 --> 03:39:15.795]  And the video that I'm in illustrates that.
[03:39:15.875 --> 03:39:24.201]  When the guy who comes in and starts accusing me of being a racist, he was inciting people to fight him all day long.
[03:39:24.482 --> 03:39:25.923]  We captured it in that video.
[03:39:26.163 --> 03:39:28.165]  He even says, put your hands on me.
[03:39:28.185 --> 03:39:32.148]  And then later that day, you've seen the headline on New York Daily News.
[03:39:32.588 --> 03:39:34.990]  He's on the front page, blooded headline.
[03:39:35.811 --> 03:39:37.232]  Blood is on Don's hands.
[03:39:37.492 --> 03:39:37.872]  That's right.
[03:39:39.571 --> 03:39:40.771]  That's the way they spin it, yeah.
[03:39:41.352 --> 03:39:43.172]  Yeah, how's that for one-sided reporting?
[03:39:43.332 --> 03:39:44.132]  It's absolutely amazing.
[03:39:44.353 --> 03:39:51.595]  You know, we were watching, somebody put up a stream, about a half-hour stream of what happened in Chicago, and I was sitting there watching it with my family.
[03:39:51.615 --> 03:40:03.979]  At one point, there was a black protester who got up on the dais behind the podium, and these guys are trying to get him off, and he's fighting them, he's swinging, and then later on he's swinging at somebody else, and I said,
[03:40:05.299 --> 03:40:06.520]  Why doesn't somebody just punch him?
[03:40:06.560 --> 03:40:08.921]  I mean, I'm not, that's not my reaction to things.
[03:40:08.961 --> 03:40:11.663]  Anybody knows me knows I'm not a fighter like that.
[03:40:12.003 --> 03:40:13.745]  But I mean, it just, it makes me angry.
[03:40:13.785 --> 03:40:28.174]  And I don't think that when Donald Trump reacts like that, looking at that, and it's not necessarily an incitement, it's a response to this kind of in-your-face provocation, this kind of bullying, and the fact that won't somebody just get him out of here?
[03:40:28.194 --> 03:40:29.375]  I mean, just remove him by force.
[03:40:29.395 --> 03:40:32.237]  He's injected himself into a private rally.
[03:40:32.657 --> 03:40:34.998]  And that's the point at which he is no longer free speech.
[03:40:35.158 --> 03:40:38.740]  Now he is aggressively in your space with that.
[03:40:38.981 --> 03:40:40.842]  And that's the thing that people need to understand.
[03:40:40.882 --> 03:40:41.802]  These are private rallies.
[03:40:42.062 --> 03:40:42.703]  They come in there.
[03:40:43.063 --> 03:40:44.444]  One person will create a disturbance.
[03:40:44.724 --> 03:40:45.984]  They'll move that person out.
[03:40:46.064 --> 03:40:47.685]  And then the next person is sitting there.
[03:40:47.905 --> 03:40:49.907]  As soon as things start to calm down, they get up.
[03:40:49.967 --> 03:40:52.148]  They just want to shut down your speech.
[03:40:53.849 --> 03:40:59.652]  Well, and I think that video not only illustrates that, but also the ignorance of most of the left supporters.
[03:41:00.615 --> 03:41:16.687]  And I think it's terribly ironic that every other candidate in the race, not just the Democratic candidates, but even the Republicans, are asking for Trump to ask his supporters to stop inciting violence, when it's clearly the Democratic supporters.
[03:41:16.747 --> 03:41:18.168]  They say it on record.
[03:41:18.629 --> 03:41:19.449]  And then how about this?
[03:41:19.869 --> 03:41:21.851]  They will accuse Donald Trump
[03:41:22.566 --> 03:41:29.648]  Or they will compare Donald Trump to Hitler while they're funded by George Soros, a known Nazi collaborator.
[03:41:29.708 --> 03:41:30.108]  That's right.
[03:41:30.348 --> 03:41:30.708]  That's right.
[03:41:31.048 --> 03:41:32.329]  And you know, people see through this.
[03:41:32.749 --> 03:41:37.570]  People understand that this is just naked opportunism.
[03:41:37.890 --> 03:41:42.271]  This is nothing but political ambition that we've seen on the part of Ted Cruz doing this.
[03:41:42.412 --> 03:41:47.573]  This is as obnoxious as what he did to Ben Carson at the Iowa caucus.
[03:41:48.093 --> 03:41:50.774]  Spreading lies that he knew full well were lies.
[03:41:51.654 --> 03:41:59.920]  When that first information came out that they said they were basing the lies and the rumors that Ben Carson had dropped out, the person who tweeted that tweeted immediately.
[03:41:59.960 --> 03:42:01.021]  There was a pair of tweets.
[03:42:01.422 --> 03:42:04.024]  One of them said, and oh, by the way, he's made it clear he's not dropping out.
[03:42:04.044 --> 03:42:06.165]  And they did that 20 minutes before the caucus started.
[03:42:06.545 --> 03:42:12.490]  And then after the caucuses started, 20 minutes later, the Ted Cruz people start spreading that lie.
[03:42:12.790 --> 03:42:18.795]  And of course, Ted Cruz chose a campaign manager who was noted for being a dirty trickster.
[03:42:19.315 --> 03:42:21.316]  They continue to spread that lie for another half hour.
[03:42:21.396 --> 03:42:27.080]  So when he does this, and we had this article up this weekend, Infowars.com, thank you Owen, I'm going to move on.
[03:42:28.000 --> 03:42:45.870]  On Saturday, Ted Cruz lost support of prominent conservatives, and they talk about the fact that these other officers, I just read this Second City Cop blog comments from one Chicago cop going into more detail, but this came out right away on Saturday, and this was a
[03:42:47.111 --> 03:42:56.554]  John Cardillo, who is tweeting this out, he says, no, blocking ambulances, assaulting police officers are not protected by the First Amendment.
[03:42:56.654 --> 03:43:04.156]  And as I point out, anti-Trump protesters blocking ambulances, screaming at the emergency workers, FU, FU, back up and go around.
[03:43:04.176 --> 03:43:04.737]  You know what?
[03:43:05.257 --> 03:43:06.677]  That is not free speech.
[03:43:07.357 --> 03:43:07.658]  Okay?
[03:43:07.978 --> 03:43:09.458]  That is not appropriate speech.
[03:43:09.518 --> 03:43:11.539]  But nobody, Ted doesn't...
[03:43:12.279 --> 03:43:12.820]  Condemn them.
[03:43:13.160 --> 03:43:20.046]  Instead, he condemns his political opponent, tries to throw him under the bus just as he has his Senate colleagues, okay?
[03:43:20.126 --> 03:43:33.076]  This is what made this kind of thing that he did to Ben Carson, what he's doing to Donald Trump with this Chicago rally, this is what made Ted Cruz the pariah of the Senate.
[03:43:33.757 --> 03:43:35.379]  He immediately began running for Senate.
[03:43:35.739 --> 03:43:41.924]  He immediately threw his colleagues under the bus at every opportunity to climb over their backs so that he could become president.
[03:43:42.245 --> 03:43:44.787]  That's why he's so resoundingly hated.
[03:43:45.107 --> 03:43:48.410]  And he's now showing this side to the American voters.
[03:43:48.430 --> 03:43:55.917]  But let's look at this report that Darren McBreen put together that shows how the media is spinning all of this.
[03:43:57.423 --> 03:44:19.224]  The Democrats and the corporate-controlled mainstream media have joined forces with the establishment Republicans to form an alliance against what has become their common enemy, and that is Donald Trump, who is clearly the GOP frontrunner and is on target to win the Republican nomination.
[03:44:19.764 --> 03:44:25.325]  And that, my friends, has both the left and the right in a total panic mode.
[03:44:25.685 --> 03:44:30.347]  Look, we've all seen the demonization of Donald Trump by the national media.
[03:44:30.787 --> 03:44:35.068]  I mean, he was never accused of being a racist until he ran for president.
[03:44:35.568 --> 03:44:39.869]  Trump's bigotry and pandering to win the support of prejudiced voters
[03:44:40.509 --> 03:44:41.170]  Well, it's a myth.
[03:44:41.650 --> 03:44:48.479]  It's a slanderous character assassination all too common with the politically correct left.
[03:44:48.859 --> 03:44:52.363]  And if they disagree with you, they play the race card.
[03:44:52.784 --> 03:44:54.606]  Most Americans, we've had enough.
[03:44:54.946 --> 03:44:56.268]  I mean, we're getting sick of it.
[03:44:56.508 --> 03:45:11.540]  And by now, I'm sure you've all seen the video of the protester at the Trump rally who got sucker-punched in the face after disrupting Trump's speech and then flipping off the crowd as he was being escorted out of the building.
[03:45:11.560 --> 03:45:19.107]  78-year-old John McGraw, there in the cowboy hat, well, he took a cheap shot at the protester, Rakim Jones.
[03:45:19.847 --> 03:45:24.932]  And naturally, the mainstream news media is having a field day with this.
[03:45:24.992 --> 03:45:29.395]  I mean, they're making it sound as if it was Donald Trump himself who punched the guy.
[03:45:29.415 --> 03:45:32.958]  And we all know it was a cowardly thing to do.
[03:45:33.299 --> 03:45:35.821]  Maybe the old man was trying to play the knockout game.
[03:45:37.253 --> 03:45:46.377]  Alright, that was a cheap shot too, but you know, the biggest and most vicious sucker punches are coming from the mainstream media and they're landing on Donald Trump.
[03:45:46.517 --> 03:45:51.379]  You know, it's something you never want to see happen, but again, it's not connected to the campaign whatsoever.
[03:45:51.760 --> 03:45:54.241]  It's just, it's something that happened in the crowd by bystanders.
[03:45:55.462 --> 03:46:06.570]  I guess, Jeff, what some would say here, and let me ask you, some would say it is connected to the campaign, or maybe it's connected to the campaign in terms of the tone and the atmosphere that the candidate himself is creating.
[03:46:06.590 --> 03:46:12.555]  And most of the time, when there is a disruption at a Trump rally, it is a setup.
[03:46:13.135 --> 03:46:20.278]  Remember the guy who showed up at a Trump rally who said we have a problem with Muslims in this country?
[03:46:20.578 --> 03:46:22.539]  We have a problem in this country.
[03:46:22.559 --> 03:46:23.900]  It's called Muslims.
[03:46:24.300 --> 03:46:26.761]  We know our current president is one.
[03:46:26.901 --> 03:46:30.603]  Well, that guy was a Democratic plant in Trump's audience.
[03:46:30.903 --> 03:46:34.364]  He's an operative, an agent provocateur, or whatever you want to call him.
[03:46:34.404 --> 03:46:36.145]  He's not a real Trump supporter.
[03:46:36.585 --> 03:46:48.157]  He's notorious for showing up at tea parties wearing Nazi t-shirts while at the same time contributing to left-wing blogs and anti-tea party websites.
[03:46:48.657 --> 03:46:49.198]  He's a fake.
[03:46:49.438 --> 03:46:50.079]  He's a fraud.
[03:46:50.359 --> 03:46:58.147]  And he was planted there in the audience to make the average Trump supporter look like a dumbass and a racist.
[03:46:58.627 --> 03:47:07.411]  I mean, the mainstream media played this exchange over and over again on television, but they never revealed to the public that the guy was a fraud.
[03:47:07.611 --> 03:47:16.695]  Much like the time Jeb Bush sent one of his own staff members to a Trump rally to play the role of a female antagonist.
[03:47:17.095 --> 03:47:24.218]  It was quickly revealed by independent media that she was planted there to frame Donald Trump.
[03:47:24.898 --> 03:47:28.420]  But that didn't stop CNN from framing the narrative.
[03:47:28.980 --> 03:47:31.761]  Did mom ever stare at you like this, Donald?
[03:47:32.101 --> 03:47:35.403]  Just when Trump thought it was safe to go on to the next question.
[03:47:35.963 --> 03:47:38.985]  If you become president, will a woman make the same as a man?
[03:47:39.405 --> 03:47:41.566]  And do I get to choose what I do with my body?
[03:47:44.002 --> 03:47:47.405]  You're gonna make the same if you do as good a job, and I happen to be pro-life.
[03:47:47.825 --> 03:47:51.188]  So there's your stereotypical hit piece from CNN.
[03:47:51.228 --> 03:47:58.454]  They refused to tell their audience that the angry woman there at the Trump rally was working for Jeb Bush.
[03:47:58.514 --> 03:47:59.074]  There you go.
[03:47:59.154 --> 03:48:00.796]  And guess who else is working for Jeb Bush?
[03:48:00.816 --> 03:48:02.517]  That's an excellent special report.
[03:48:02.637 --> 03:48:03.057]  I don't know.
[03:48:25.783 --> 03:48:25.903]  Yeah.
[03:48:53.911 --> 03:49:13.659]  I'm beginning to think that Ted Cruz was a plant from the very beginning so that when they say they're going to hold their nose and install Cruz in there, I think again with his connections with his wife to big corporate banking and stuff that he's been a plant all along and
[03:49:14.249 --> 03:49:18.970]  His logo, instead of trusted, should be mistrusted.
[03:49:19.390 --> 03:49:22.751]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:49:22.871 --> 03:49:24.431]  Mistrusted, yeah.
[03:49:25.252 --> 03:49:26.312]  I have said that all along.
[03:49:26.392 --> 03:49:27.472]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[03:49:28.132 --> 03:49:29.052]  I was very disturbed.
[03:49:29.072 --> 03:49:38.115]  This is a guy who, when he was running for Senate, and everybody said, wait a minute, his wife is a Goldman Sachs banker who was working on North American Union issues with the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:49:38.135 --> 03:49:39.395]  He goes, oh, they're a pit of vipers.
[03:49:39.955 --> 03:49:44.156]  And just as I pointed out earlier, you know, he's throwing around the word neocon and they're saying he's using that as a dog whistle.
[03:49:44.396 --> 03:49:46.916]  Absolutely he's using that as a dog whistle.
[03:49:47.416 --> 03:49:58.638]  There's an article up on Drudge Report today talking about how he has his data people at South by Southwest talking about how they are data mining everything.
[03:49:58.678 --> 03:50:04.499]  They can determine precisely what the issues are that you want to hear and tell you precisely what you want to hear.
[03:50:04.799 --> 03:50:06.960]  And that's what Ted Cruz has been doing.
[03:50:07.340 --> 03:50:08.180]  He has been there
[03:50:08.740 --> 03:50:10.181]  From the very beginning, I agree with you.
[03:50:10.241 --> 03:50:17.024]  He has been the inside plant man to take the Libertarian vote away, the oxygen in the room away from Rand Paul.
[03:50:17.545 --> 03:50:19.606]  I think Rand Paul was authentic on these issues.
[03:50:19.946 --> 03:50:22.807]  I do not think that Ted Cruz was authentic on these issues.
[03:50:22.827 --> 03:50:25.068]  One of the things that really concerns me...
[03:50:26.349 --> 03:50:31.271]  Bill, about this is what he's done portraying himself as a Christian.
[03:50:31.771 --> 03:50:43.155]  And I had completely missed what happened back in November until Drudge put this up on Monday about him going to this conference where this pastor, his name is Kevin Swanson, I didn't know anything about this guy.
[03:50:43.655 --> 03:50:48.139]  But he's essentially like these Westboro Baptist people, if you look at this clip.
[03:50:48.379 --> 03:50:50.241]  We're going to play this clip for you when we come back.
[03:50:50.621 --> 03:50:53.143]  It absolutely is astounding to me.
[03:50:53.264 --> 03:50:56.346]  And as a Christian, I want to disavow this.
[03:50:56.646 --> 03:51:02.151]  And I want to ask Ted Cruz, why would you not disavow Kevin Swanson?
[03:51:02.992 --> 03:51:03.853]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:08.787 --> 03:51:18.916]  Extend your life with ExtendoVite, a 7-herb combination made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, hawthorn, ginkgo biloba, valerian, and milk thistle.

[03:52:08.431 --> 03:52:10.412]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[03:52:10.492 --> 03:52:11.532]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:52:11.732 --> 03:52:13.172]  Rob Dew joins us.
[03:52:13.332 --> 03:52:16.133]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:52:16.433 --> 03:52:17.473]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[03:52:17.493 --> 03:52:18.453]  I've been working all day.
[03:52:18.473 --> 03:52:20.834]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:52:20.954 --> 03:52:21.954]  I get in here at 830.
[03:52:22.374 --> 03:52:24.015]  I was kind of run down.
[03:52:24.295 --> 03:52:25.995]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[03:52:26.215 --> 03:52:28.076]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:52:28.096 --> 03:52:30.698]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there and popped two of them.
[03:52:30.978 --> 03:52:35.141]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just kind of clears up.
[03:52:35.221 --> 03:52:36.502]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:52:36.722 --> 03:52:37.743]  People really love it.
[03:52:38.063 --> 03:52:38.584]  Read about it.
[03:52:38.664 --> 03:52:42.406]  Find out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.

[03:54:20.201 --> 03:54:22.083]  I'm going to try to get to as many callers as I can.
[03:54:22.103 --> 03:54:25.947]  We've got too many to get to, but I want to go to David in Russia who has been holding.
[03:54:25.987 --> 03:54:29.450]  Before I do, real quickly, I want to let you know about a special that I didn't mention earlier.

[03:54:56.875 --> 03:54:57.555]  David, go ahead.
[03:54:58.957 --> 03:54:59.737]  Hi, how are you today?
[03:55:00.078 --> 03:55:00.438]  Doing good.
[03:55:01.727 --> 03:55:05.949]  Yeah, I'm calling about the two-year anniversary of the Crimean referendum.
[03:55:06.429 --> 03:55:20.516]  I've been in Crimea for about 15 years, and I'm looking at what's going on since the referendum, and the hypocrisy that's going on is just amazing.
[03:55:20.976 --> 03:55:25.118]  If we listen to what Valenti was saying earlier about what happened in Kosovo,
[03:55:26.019 --> 03:55:30.344]  Uh, there you have an armed group of Muslims take over part of the country.
[03:55:30.384 --> 03:55:34.929]  The international community just approved it, gave them their own country and so on and so forth.
[03:55:35.310 --> 03:55:39.415]  In Crimea, they had a CIA back to
[03:55:40.374 --> 03:55:43.778]  Uh, using Neo-Nazis, overthrow the duly elected government.
[03:55:43.858 --> 03:55:46.681]  It may not have been the best government, but it was duly elected.
[03:55:46.701 --> 03:55:49.884]  And, and I'm not just saying it's the CIA back, too.
[03:55:49.964 --> 03:55:54.949]  If you Google, uh, CIA relationship... We've reported on that quite a bit.
[03:55:54.989 --> 03:55:56.691]  You see that there being in the country, then.
[03:55:56.731 --> 03:55:58.253]  You see the same thing we've reported on.
[03:55:59.413 --> 03:56:02.615]  Of course, we know Victoria Nuland has talked about this.
[03:56:02.655 --> 03:56:05.976]  We know we've talked about the George Soros NGOs that are behind that.
[03:56:06.276 --> 03:56:08.818]  And of course, that has been the American foreign policy.
[03:56:08.838 --> 03:56:09.938]  It's not a policy of defense.
[03:56:10.358 --> 03:56:11.439]  It's a policy of chaos.
[03:56:12.059 --> 03:56:13.820]  And we see the same thing happening in Syria.
[03:56:14.620 --> 03:56:16.761]  Assad is not a perfect guy, okay?
[03:56:16.801 --> 03:56:25.364]  But just as we saw in Libya, in spite of what Hillary Clinton says, and of course lying is her superpower, she can say, we went into Libya and we didn't lose anybody.
[03:56:25.424 --> 03:56:25.684]  Really?
[03:56:25.704 --> 03:56:26.384]  Really?
[03:56:26.404 --> 03:56:32.046]  You not only lost American citizens, you even lost your ambassador, you might remember that, but she doesn't remember that.
[03:56:33.067 --> 03:56:41.755]  But the fact is that we have turned that place into an arms bazaar for ISIS, and we just create chaos everywhere we go, overthrowing regimes.
[03:56:41.815 --> 03:56:43.736]  So we know the same thing's going to happen in Syria.
[03:56:44.057 --> 03:56:48.621]  That's what they're trying to do at the underbelly of Russia, and they started up the Cold War.
[03:56:48.661 --> 03:56:57.809]  Now, from my perspective, I don't know what you think about this, my perspective is what's behind this, is they want to get the big-ticket items of the military-industrial complex going again.
[03:56:57.849 --> 03:56:58.290]  What do you think?
[03:56:59.764 --> 03:57:08.167]  Oh yeah, they're doing just stock options and stuff like that with the, you know, saying, oh, we're going to bomb Syria and react on the stock goes through the roof.
[03:57:08.207 --> 03:57:11.448]  So, you know, they don't even need to start the war anymore.
[03:57:11.468 --> 03:57:13.308]  They can do a bubble on the stock market.
[03:57:13.528 --> 03:57:15.469]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:57:15.969 --> 03:57:17.330]  Well, I agree with you, David.
[03:57:17.350 --> 03:57:18.850]  I think that's exactly what's going on.
[03:57:18.910 --> 03:57:21.871]  It's interesting that you see the same thing happening there on the ground.
[03:57:22.331 --> 03:57:25.032]  Real quickly, because we're about out of time, I want to go to Doug in Tennessee.
[03:57:25.052 --> 03:57:27.873]  Doug, you think that we're talking about pushing Trump too much.
[03:57:27.953 --> 03:57:28.213]  Go ahead.
[03:57:28.962 --> 03:57:29.442]  Well, yeah.
[03:57:29.622 --> 03:57:37.346]  I mean, I'm a ten-year-long listener to the show, so I'm not... Please take this criticism in good spirits.
[03:57:38.086 --> 03:57:43.409]  When you have Roger Stone on, an operative for the Trump campaign, citing anonymous sources,
[03:57:43.891 --> 03:57:48.232]  That Ted Cruz offered to drop out of the race in exchange for a Supreme Court seat.
[03:57:48.733 --> 03:57:53.294]  That was mentioned a couple Sundays ago and never mentioned since, so apparently there was nothing to that.
[03:57:54.154 --> 03:58:06.258]  Secondly, if I want to listen to Donald Trump... Well, we don't necessarily know, and I mean, you know, Roger Stone has had, even though he uses anonymous sources, he has predicted a lot of stuff like what he said about Romney.
[03:58:06.418 --> 03:58:07.919]  That became public.
[03:58:08.899 --> 03:58:26.268]  I agree with you in the sense that I don't want to become a cheerleader for Trump, but I gotta say that on these issues of globalism, with the trade treaties, with the climate treaties, with the open borders, these are the things that are the fundamental, critical path for the globalists.
[03:58:26.308 --> 03:58:31.850]  Just as we realized the last election, they gave us two candidates, both of whom were going to give us Obamacare.
[03:58:32.210 --> 03:58:33.031]  The fix was in.
[03:58:33.351 --> 03:58:34.913]  We understand the fix was in for this.
[03:58:35.233 --> 03:58:39.837]  The only person pushing against that fix on that issue is Donald Trump, and that's a big issue.
[03:58:39.877 --> 03:58:48.985]  Join us tonight for returns of these critical states as they come in.
[03:58:49.025 --> 03:58:52.689]  You are listening to GCN.
