[00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:21.560]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.960]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.882]  It is March 2nd, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:39.346]  Tonight, Ben Carson pulls out of tomorrow's GOP debate, saying he sees no path forward for his nomination for president in the wake of Super Tuesday.
[00:00:39.846 --> 00:00:44.168]  And this time, it's not a dirty trick rumor spread by Ted Cruz.
[00:00:45.197 --> 00:00:51.023]  Then, John McAfee explains what's really behind the FBI's back door for the iPhone.
[00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:54.487]  What they're asking for is a master key when they don't need one.
[00:00:54.727 --> 00:00:56.990]  They just have one phone that says, please give us the information.
[00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:06.319]  The cyber security expert and presidential candidate unmasks the deception as the FBI tries to establish a new legal precedent for the surveillance state.
[00:01:07.404 --> 00:01:10.906]  And highlights of our live Super Tuesday election coverage.
[00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:14.507]  Paul Ryan, I don't know him well, but I'm sure I'm gonna get along great with him.
[00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:17.408]  And if I don't, he's gonna have to pay a big price, okay?
[00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.690]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:10.478]  Now I'm not sure if you can call today Super Wednesday, but I do know yesterday was Super Tuesday, and we do have the delegate results.
[00:03:10.538 --> 00:03:13.499]  Now, the numbers I'm going to be using are from the New York Times.
[00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:17.360]  There are many different sites with varying numbers, but this is what I'm going to use for right now.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.121]  We see Donald Trump, he has the Republican lead on delegates with 319.
[00:03:22.822 --> 00:03:26.243]  Ted Cruz with 226 and Marco Rubio with 110.
[00:03:26.403 --> 00:03:33.406]  And for the Democrats, Mrs. Clinton has 577 and Bernie Sanders with 386.
[00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:41.148]  Now, there was some suspected shenanigans going on, at least here in the state of Texas in Travis County, where Austin is.
[00:03:41.448 --> 00:03:45.410]  We had multiple people showing up to the polls and they're calling into the radio stations.
[00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.230]  They're saying, hey,
[00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.017]  I voted for Donald Trump, but my vote got switched to Marco Rubio or some other person.
[00:03:51.317 --> 00:03:53.981]  And many people said this, so it is being investigated.
[00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.565]  What, if anything, is going to come out of this?
[00:03:56.585 --> 00:04:00.751]  I don't know, but we've previously seen Mrs. Clinton have some very
[00:04:01.812 --> 00:04:06.376]  Questionable activities going on in other places, you know, winning six coin tosses in a row.
[00:04:06.416 --> 00:04:10.259]  I don't know what the Vegas odds on that are, but I'm pretty sure they're pretty low.
[00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:12.240]  But we'll go with the numbers for the time being.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.883]  But it doesn't seem to stop the momentum of Trump.
[00:04:15.343 --> 00:04:18.866]  And as we're talking about Trump, one of the most controversial things, of course, is the wall.
[00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:20.687]  I'm not a supporter of the wall.
[00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:22.890]  Many people are not supporters of the wall.
[00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.432]  Vicente Fox said he's not going to build that effing wall.
[00:04:25.813 --> 00:04:34.101]  But regardless, what I think, or Vicente Fox, many people in the border towns where this wall is going to be built are actually voting for Donald Trump.
[00:04:34.461 --> 00:04:35.162]  You'll see this article.
[00:04:35.182 --> 00:04:36.563]  This is coming out of The Guardian.
[00:04:37.064 --> 00:04:39.967]  Trump dominates in Texas border town with the proposed wall.
[00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:40.887]  We're good to go.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.580]  People turned out and they said they won the wall.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.801]  So regardless of what I want, some people definitely want it.
[00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:05.221]  I don't think it's a good idea.
[00:05:05.241 --> 00:05:10.523]  It's going to be a never-ending construction project that's going to go to Mr. Trump's properties itself.
[00:05:10.623 --> 00:05:14.183]  So, you know, he definitely has an incentive in doing that.
[00:05:14.243 --> 00:05:21.725]  But as, you know, I don't agree with Marco Rubio on many things, but he did make the point that El Chapo could build a tunnel underneath it, people could climb over it.
[00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:24.406]  But also, Trump said the wall just got 10 feet taller.
[00:05:24.426 --> 00:05:25.266]  So we'll see what happens.
[00:05:25.746 --> 00:05:41.856]  Now, as we see the massive surge in the polls for Donald Trump and also questionable things going on with the Bernie Sanders campaign, many allegations of some Clinton fraud, one of our roving reporters, Richard Reeves, is asking people, do you want to switch your vote from Bernie Sanders to Donald Trump?
[00:05:43.757 --> 00:05:45.038]  Oh, you already voted?
[00:05:45.058 --> 00:05:46.799]  Come here, come here.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.640]  What's your name, sir?
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.821]  Wyatt Tackle.
[00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:51.202]  Wyatt, tell us who you voted for.
[00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:55.362]  I voted for Bernie Sanders.
[00:05:55.902 --> 00:05:56.742]  Bernie Sanders.
[00:05:56.762 --> 00:06:00.543]  So a lot of your comrades here on campus voted for Bernie Sanders, evidently, right?
[00:06:00.843 --> 00:06:02.584]  That is the impression I get, yes.
[00:06:03.264 --> 00:06:06.585]  So when you talk to your comrades, what do they think about Donald J. Trump?
[00:06:07.386 --> 00:06:08.526]  That he's their second choice.
[00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:09.626]  Really?
[00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:10.286]  Second choice?
[00:06:10.807 --> 00:06:12.427]  No, this is a new thing here now.
[00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:17.609]  Explain to us why Donald J. Trump would be the second choice for Bernie Sanders supporters.
[00:06:18.174 --> 00:06:25.970]  Because they value that he's not an establishment candidate, and that he doesn't take big money from other people.
[00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:27.793]  And his name isn't Hillary Clinton.
[00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:40.476]  Wow, so folks, there's something I've been talking about for a while is I think the number two guy for a lot of Bernie Sanders folks is Donald J. Trump, and here we have confirmation from a young man here at UT.
[00:06:40.836 --> 00:06:43.077]  So, you already voted or are you going to vote?
[00:06:43.317 --> 00:06:43.897]  I already voted.
[00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:48.899]  Okay, so besides Bernie Sanders and Trump, who did you look at?
[00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.100]  Who did you consider?
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.122]  Um, that was really pretty much it.
[00:06:54.842 --> 00:06:57.123]  So that makes it pretty much anti-establishment?
[00:06:57.555 --> 00:06:57.936]  Absolutely.
[00:06:57.976 --> 00:06:58.877]  That's pretty important to me.
[00:06:59.198 --> 00:07:04.485]  And I think big money and political contributions are ruining the whole system.
[00:07:04.505 --> 00:07:07.490]  And they're the only two candidates that really stand strong against it.
[00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:08.972]  Alright.
[00:07:09.132 --> 00:07:10.655]  Any last thoughts for our audience?
[00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:12.537]  It's going to be a crazy year.
[00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:20.361]  Now another person in this election is one Ben Carson, the neurosurgeon, and he recently came out with a statement to his constituents.
[00:07:20.861 --> 00:07:21.741]  This was on CNN.
[00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:23.762]  I don't see a political path forward.
[00:07:24.282 --> 00:07:32.906]  And he sent out a message on email from his campaign chairman, Bob Deese, and he says Carson will also go into more detail during an appearance.
[00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:36.987]  At the Conservative Political Action Committee Conference near Washington, D.C.
[00:07:37.227 --> 00:07:37.807]  on Friday.
[00:07:38.247 --> 00:07:40.288]  So it looks like Ben may be bowing out of the race.
[00:07:40.348 --> 00:07:45.489]  I know he and Trump at least seem a little friendly as far as policies.
[00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:47.530]  Maybe he's going to make him a VP or something like that.
[00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.891]  I kind of foresaw a Trump-Carson ticket, but maybe Ben's just bowing out.
[00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:53.631]  May end up being Surgeon General.
[00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:54.111]  Who knows?
[00:07:54.211 --> 00:07:59.232]  I think Trump will at least have him in his campaign at some point if he does become the President of the United States.
[00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:01.133]  First, I'm voting for John McAfee.
[00:08:01.598 --> 00:08:03.920]  All right, now moving on, we have Governor Ventura.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.645]  He's threatening to get into the race if Mrs. Clinton wins the Democratic nomination.
[00:08:09.225 --> 00:08:18.614]  And he says his reason is that the country is fed up with these establishment candidates being thrust down their throats, and he thinks Donald Trump is too much of a pro-war hawk.
[00:08:19.094 --> 00:08:26.941]  He says, if Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio, the chances are better, and I don't want the revolution to die if Bernie gets beat.
[00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:28.102]  Ventura added.
[00:08:28.122 --> 00:08:31.044]  So he says, hey, I don't want nothing to do with this Clinton 2016.
[00:08:32.065 --> 00:08:41.333]  He doesn't want to see the first man, Bill, riding around on his tractor, cutting the grass, or whatever he's going to be doing when he's not up to his other shenanigans.
[00:08:41.353 --> 00:08:44.136]  So Governor Ventura is threatening to get into the race.
[00:08:45.697 --> 00:08:48.659]  I'd rather see him than Hillary Clinton, to be quite honest with you.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.901]  But we'll see what happens.
[00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:54.164]  It may just be a publicity stunt, but we'll see what happens as we go forward.
[00:08:54.544 --> 00:08:58.047]  Now, if you're looking at the political race and you say, hey, I don't like any of these candidates.
[00:08:58.448 --> 00:08:59.809]  I wish this guy would have got in.
[00:08:59.849 --> 00:09:01.570]  I wish this guy would have got more delegates.
[00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.954]  We have our new reporter, Matt Weber, who's going to explain to us the delegate process.
[00:09:07.605 --> 00:09:08.246]  Thanks Jakari.
[00:09:08.927 --> 00:09:14.454]  So my goal today is to be able to inform you a little bit more about the delegate process.
[00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:21.704]  If you're like me and you're just learning about the delegate process in this election cycle, at first it may seem confusing.
[00:09:22.245 --> 00:09:25.088]  But the bright side is that anyone can actually become a delegate.
[00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:33.013]  Now, there are three things that you need to take care of before you get into this whole delegate selection deal.
[00:09:33.654 --> 00:09:35.635]  First, you need to be a registered voter.
[00:09:35.915 --> 00:09:37.496]  That's a given for anything.
[00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:43.159]  I mean, even on the most superficial level where you're just casting your vote for the president.
[00:09:44.235 --> 00:09:46.136]  Second, you need to do a little bit of research.
[00:09:46.617 --> 00:09:52.641]  The reason for this is because the way the delegate process works in every state is different from every other state.
[00:09:53.081 --> 00:09:55.423]  There are some nuances that are unique to each state.
[00:09:56.883 --> 00:10:01.066]  So, not only do you have to do a little bit of research, but you need to keep up to date with it.
[00:10:01.326 --> 00:10:05.990]  The reason is because the rules can actually change in between election cycles.
[00:10:06.897 --> 00:10:13.321]  So now that you've registered to vote, you've done some research, you need to go out and get involved locally.
[00:10:14.022 --> 00:10:28.391]  Now, this is especially important in states where there are caucuses, because oftentimes to get selected as a delegate, after you'll go attend your caucus and votes have been cast for the presidential election, other business takes place.
[00:10:28.772 --> 00:10:36.297]  And that is being selected to become a delegate to go to your county convention.
[00:10:36.977 --> 00:10:42.260]  So let's start with the levels of conventions that you'll need to attend in order to get to the national convention.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:50.604]  In 2016, this election cycle for president, there's a national convention for both the Republican and the Democratic side.
[00:10:51.224 --> 00:10:54.306]  For the Democrats, they'll be attending a convention in Philadelphia.
[00:10:54.886 --> 00:10:58.708]  For the Republicans, they'll be attending a convention in Cleveland, Ohio.
[00:10:59.588 --> 00:11:04.470]  So, first, you'll get elected, typically, at your county convention level.
[00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:16.376]  From there, you'll go on to your state convention, and if you've made it to the state convention, you can then be elected to go on to the national convention and represent your state in electing the president.
[00:11:16.996 --> 00:11:19.738]  Now, this is where primaries and caucuses start to differ.
[00:11:20.538 --> 00:11:32.466]  In states that have primary elections, you typically needed to be involved in the county level or the local level and get elected as a delegate in 2015, earlier than this election year.
[00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:39.131]  In states that have caucuses, however, what happens is after the caucus, you can go on and get elected.
[00:11:39.852 --> 00:11:47.377]  You bring, let's say, 20, 30 friends with you to a caucus and you can have them vote you in as a delegate.
[00:11:48.743 --> 00:11:53.784]  So now let's go through the differences between the four states that I've attended so far.
[00:11:54.824 --> 00:12:05.687]  Iowa and Nevada have been similar in the regard that they were both caucuses and you were elected as a delegate after people caucused for who they'd like to become the president.
[00:12:07.607 --> 00:12:09.648]  South Carolina was a little bit different.
[00:12:10.048 --> 00:12:10.968]  It's a hybrid state.
[00:12:12.037 --> 00:12:19.505]  South Carolina, there are seven different districts that award three delegates each on a proportional basis.
[00:12:19.585 --> 00:12:23.349]  So whoever wins each district would get those three delegates.
[00:12:25.859 --> 00:12:30.723]  There were 50 delegates in total, meaning that 29 delegates were statewide delegates.
[00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.366]  They were delegates that were awarded to the overall winner.
[00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:37.630]  So as you can tell, the differences between the states can be complex.
[00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:44.155]  But if you do your homework, you can definitely crack this and get an A. And by get an A, I mean get elected as a delegate.
[00:12:44.616 --> 00:12:50.001]  If you'd like to know more about the delegate process, make sure to do your research and stay tuned to InfoWars.
[00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:51.162]  Back to you, Jakari.
[00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:55.972]  Now another presidential contender is John McAfee.
[00:12:55.992 --> 00:13:00.216]  He's, you probably have him on your computer right now, McAfee Antivirus Software.
[00:13:00.577 --> 00:13:02.499]  You guys probably heard about this Apple deal.
[00:13:03.099 --> 00:13:08.525]  The police, the FBI more specifically, are saying that they want to get into the phone of the San Bernardino shooters.
[00:13:09.265 --> 00:13:13.850]  And they're saying, hey Apple, we want you to open the back door into your IOS.
[00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.191]  And Apple's saying, I'm not going for it.
[00:13:15.571 --> 00:13:18.174]  Once again, I know Apple has been involved in the Prism scandal.
[00:13:18.274 --> 00:13:19.795]  Edward Snowden brought us that information.
[00:13:19.835 --> 00:13:23.939]  So I don't completely trust Apple, but just assuming that they're on the up and up on this.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:30.065]  John McAfee says, not only can I hack into this, I can tell you how to do this over a TV screen in FBI.
[00:13:30.085 --> 00:13:31.626]  You can do it in about 30 minutes.
[00:13:32.327 --> 00:13:39.791]  And so he took to the air and he is one of the 12 candidates vying for the Libertarian Party nomination to run for president this year.
[00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:42.253]  And he said, hey, if you guys want to do it, I'll tell you how.
[00:13:42.293 --> 00:13:43.253]  He goes into detail.
[00:13:43.273 --> 00:13:44.814]  You can see those videos online.
[00:13:44.834 --> 00:13:49.216]  He says, FBI, you don't need all this other backdoor hacking to get into the phone.
[00:13:49.236 --> 00:13:51.678]  You can do it quite easily if you so desire.
[00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.760]  And that's why there's a lot of speculation going on out there that
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.022]  Apple or the Feds wanted more than just this one phone.
[00:13:59.062 --> 00:14:01.443]  We've seen reports that they had many phones lined up.
[00:14:01.504 --> 00:14:05.966]  It's like, well, hell, since you're already opening this phone, why don't you have the oven on?
[00:14:06.086 --> 00:14:08.067]  Why don't you throw all this other stuff in there?
[00:14:08.608 --> 00:14:11.930]  And Apple's like, no, we don't really want to go for that, FBI.
[00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:24.077]  So if you are on the up and up, Apple, I do respect your resilience to this, what I would say, an overreach, a backdoor intrusion to technology that already has enough backdoors into it.
[00:14:24.537 --> 00:14:27.058]  I want to give you guys an update on the story I did last year.
[00:14:27.458 --> 00:14:43.526]  You guys may recall, they were bringing in a lot of refugees, not just to the state of Texas, but Austin in particular, and there's one high school that actually Alex went to, and they were bringing a lot of them in there, and they had so many Arabic students they needed to get teachers from the local universities.
[00:14:43.546 --> 00:14:49.828]  You know, kids or graduate students would come and volunteer from UT to teach the kids how to speak English, you know, the ESL program.
[00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:59.852]  While I do understand why people are coming here, we see so many domestic conflicts, or excuse me, foreign conflicts, that involve Syria, Pakistan, Yemen.
[00:14:59.912 --> 00:15:04.773]  And if I lived in Yemen and Pakistan and I had to worry about a drone blowing up my wedding party, I'd want to leave too.
[00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:09.654]  If I lived in Syria and I had to worry about the U.S.
[00:15:09.674 --> 00:15:13.816]  giving rocket launchers and grenades to Al-Qaeda and ISIS, I'd want to leave too.
[00:15:13.876 --> 00:15:14.856]  So I'm not knocking people
[00:15:15.236 --> 00:15:19.257]  Who come here but I definitely believe there is a legal and lawful way to do that.
[00:15:19.577 --> 00:15:21.337]  That's one of the reasons I agree with John McAfee.
[00:15:21.357 --> 00:15:25.698]  I like his immigration policy and you guys can go read that if you are interested in that.
[00:15:25.718 --> 00:15:27.579]  And basically it's just a more streamlined process.
[00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:29.939]  I'm not a fan of the catch and release programs.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:36.361]  I think why don't we get rid of some of these catch and release programs and just streamline it so it's easier for people to get into the country.
[00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:41.942]  Or even if you are declined, you know much sooner and you know why if you want to remedy that situation.
[00:15:42.243 --> 00:15:51.085]  That's a very long-winded way of saying that Travis County, where Austin is, they have commissioners and they're urging immigrants to be ready for deportation relief programs.
[00:15:51.525 --> 00:15:53.426]  And this is a county judge, Eckhardt.
[00:15:53.806 --> 00:15:58.587]  She released a public service announcement urging immigrants in Travis County to prepare for the U.S.
[00:15:58.607 --> 00:16:03.208]  Supreme Court's decision on President Barack Obama's deportation relief programs.
[00:16:03.528 --> 00:16:05.069]  So it could all be coming to an end.
[00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:10.190]  I'm not a fan of, you know, rounding people up, you know, driving around in wagons and throwing people in the back.
[00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:18.373]  But if they do encounter law enforcement for whatever reason, if they're a violent felon, I have no issue deporting a violent felon, convicted violent felon.
[00:16:18.693 --> 00:16:22.274]  I don't see any reason why we should be housing those people here if they're here illegally.
[00:16:23.092 --> 00:16:24.933]  I'm talking about illegal activity abroad.
[00:16:25.293 --> 00:16:27.314]  We see Boko Haram, terrorist organizations.
[00:16:27.735 --> 00:16:32.717]  Now we see 76 starving Boko Haram members are surrendering to the Nigerian military.
[00:16:33.138 --> 00:16:44.244]  And basically it's gotten so bad that the guys are putting down the AKs in order to get a sandwich and they're reporting to military headquarters and they're just turning themselves in because they're starving to death.
[00:16:44.544 --> 00:16:48.726]  But it's not just Boko Haram, there are many good innocent people that are caught up in this as well.
[00:16:49.167 --> 00:16:50.928]  And we see the Central African Republic
[00:16:51.568 --> 00:16:54.410]  They have violence that is leaving the kids hungry out there.
[00:16:54.450 --> 00:17:03.216]  So, as wars often do, they do bring a lot of violence and, you know, crops are destroyed, lives are destroyed, farmlands are destroyed, and that's one of the things that they're dealing with.
[00:17:03.596 --> 00:17:10.521]  And also, a very important story that I think is very important, it's a journalist who's broadcasting her own arrest.
[00:17:11.525 --> 00:17:12.526]  No, I've been out in the field.
[00:17:13.026 --> 00:17:14.427]  Many of the guys have as well.
[00:17:14.768 --> 00:17:21.673]  You encounter law enforcement or just uncooperative people, and they're not too happy that you're out there with a camera.
[00:17:21.973 --> 00:17:24.015]  So there's a video that you guys can play in the background.
[00:17:24.035 --> 00:17:24.675]  It's a young lady.
[00:17:24.695 --> 00:17:26.937]  She's just basically out there reporting on the job.
[00:17:27.538 --> 00:17:30.520]  And the cops are giving her some harassment there.
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.882]  So I do respect the young lady for going out there and doing her job.
[00:17:33.482 --> 00:17:35.184]  And I understand, you know, the cops, they want to be safe.
[00:17:35.224 --> 00:17:37.025]  They want a safe barrier and all this stuff.
[00:17:37.065 --> 00:17:39.107]  But I mean, how many videos have you seen?
[00:17:39.167 --> 00:17:43.431]  If the reporter or the camera or whatever wasn't right there to get it, you never would have got the full story.
[00:17:43.491 --> 00:17:48.796]  So while there is a way, I think that reporters and police can coexist peacefully.
[00:17:48.816 --> 00:17:49.577]  I definitely do.
[00:17:50.538 --> 00:17:55.262]  I think that each side should at least have some space to do what they need to do in that situation.
[00:17:55.963 --> 00:17:59.406]  Now, that's all I have for this segment, but if you stay tuned, we have many more segments.
[00:17:59.426 --> 00:18:03.209]  We'll have a special report with John McAfee, as well as another one from John Bowne.
[00:18:03.489 --> 00:18:03.990]  Stay tuned.
[00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.432]  This is the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:18:15.834 --> 00:18:20.739]  No one will go to the New York Times or care that it's even admitted that the government's hatching most of the terror plots.
[00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:22.420]  Or people will say, what are you doing?
[00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:23.942]  Endorsing radical Islam?
[00:18:23.982 --> 00:18:24.723]  Saying it doesn't exist?
[00:18:25.103 --> 00:18:25.824]  I didn't say that!
[00:18:26.524 --> 00:18:35.753]  I said our criminal government is arming them, aiding and abetting them, protecting them to attack and kill us so they can take our freedoms!
[00:18:36.274 --> 00:18:38.356]  That's what I said!
[00:18:38.556 --> 00:18:44.301]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:18:44.741 --> 00:18:48.624]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:18:50.626 --> 00:18:58.792]  CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, Glenn Beck, and everybody else that runs around claiming that I'm saying there aren't any real Muslim terrorists.
[00:18:59.132 --> 00:19:01.154]  That's a load of crud and you know it.
[00:19:02.717 --> 00:19:06.119]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:13.584]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:19:14.205 --> 00:19:22.550]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:26.953]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:19:27.253 --> 00:19:32.637]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:19:32.837 --> 00:19:33.658]  We're good to go.
[00:20:01.218 --> 00:20:15.429]  My fellow InfoWarriors, I am very excited to be able to announce to you the introduction at InfoWarsLife.com of a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsLife formulations like Survival Shield X2 and Super Metal Vitality.

[00:21:50.528 --> 00:21:55.949]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.

[00:23:05.151 --> 00:23:10.069]  Who is McAfee.com's, one of his websites, McAfee, M-C-A-F-E-E, 2016.com?
[00:23:12.338 --> 00:23:13.678]  FutureTentCentral.com.
[00:23:13.698 --> 00:23:21.901]  I'm not going to go over his whole background at NASA and engineer and computer pioneer and the inventor of the most popular software for antivirus ever.
[00:23:22.562 --> 00:23:29.164]  Or his legendary escaping made into three major motion pictures and two or three other TV shows right now out of Belize.
[00:23:29.744 --> 00:23:33.705]  Or the fact that he claimed it was riots and terrorists and Muslim radicals coming into the U.S.
[00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:34.526]  with fake passports.
[00:23:35.286 --> 00:23:37.147]  I actually said I didn't believe that at the time.
[00:23:37.187 --> 00:23:38.927]  And I said, I don't think you're a liar, but this is too crazy.
[00:23:39.387 --> 00:23:40.528]  This is right when he got out.
[00:23:41.448 --> 00:23:42.610]  And got back into the U.S.
[00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:44.932]  Well, he talked to us from Guatemala, actually.
[00:23:44.993 --> 00:23:45.934]  No, before he was in Guatemala.
[00:23:46.154 --> 00:23:47.075]  He came on our show first.
[00:23:47.395 --> 00:23:48.377]  Recommended by his friends.
[00:23:48.417 --> 00:23:49.057]  He didn't know who we were.
[00:23:49.558 --> 00:23:50.820]  But I just couldn't buy it all.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:51.641]  I thought he was a good guy.
[00:23:51.661 --> 00:23:52.882]  But then it all came out what he said was true.
[00:23:53.503 --> 00:24:00.531]  So the real-life Captain Morgan meets... I don't know.
[00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:02.459]  I don't know.
[00:24:02.979 --> 00:24:09.082]  Captain Morgan meets another swashbuckler, let's say, from the future, Han Solo.
[00:24:09.442 --> 00:24:11.263]  It's good to have you with us, Mr. McAfee.
[00:24:12.824 --> 00:24:13.324]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:24:13.364 --> 00:24:14.165]  I'm glad to be here.
[00:24:14.445 --> 00:24:24.670]  I know you're a Trump supporter, and I regret to say that when I come out of the gates as the Libertarian nominee in May, I will mop the floor with Donald Trump.
[00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:26.410]  My apologies, sir, but that's just the way it is.
[00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:27.151]  Hey, let me be clear.
[00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:37.476]  Let me be clear, you're such a maverick and a real wild man, I want an Ace of Spades in there that'll trump, pun intended, the establishment's globalist takeover.
[00:24:37.917 --> 00:24:40.078]  So, if you had a big shot of winning, I'd be for you.
[00:24:40.098 --> 00:24:41.399]  Maybe as a libertarian you will.
[00:24:41.419 --> 00:24:43.801]  But you're going to get liberals and conservatives and libertarians.
[00:24:44.281 --> 00:24:49.745]  All I'm saying is, separate from that, your quotes on Trump, if you want to say he's bad, he's fine, go ahead.
[00:24:50.045 --> 00:24:51.946]  But isn't he scaring the whole power structure?
[00:24:52.206 --> 00:24:53.007]  Isn't that refreshing?
[00:24:54.316 --> 00:24:57.419]  It is, absolutely, and I hope I actually make it to the election.
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:15.955]  Yesterday on CNN, I debated the FBI rep, Mr. James Gordon, a very slick gentleman, actually he's a goon, but a gentleman from the FBI, on their attempt to force Apple to put a master key in their software.
[00:25:16.796 --> 00:25:37.222]  And, uh, I've been trashing the FBI and the NSA for the past week, and I claimed in Business Insider that the, um, that the NSA, by forcing a backdoor on a piece of software illegally, by planting a programmer, um, in, uh, a major computer manufacturer, allowed the government to be hacked by foreign agents because the foreign agents got that backdoor.
[00:25:37.262 --> 00:25:42.083]  So, I fully expect any moment my door to be burst in and, and a joint FBI, uh, NSA hack.
[00:25:42.103 --> 00:25:44.484]  So let's be clear, you're saying you've released some classified info?
[00:25:45.973 --> 00:25:46.533]  I did, yes sir.
[00:25:46.814 --> 00:25:47.074]  I did.
[00:25:47.674 --> 00:25:48.715]  And it was absolutely true.
[00:25:49.495 --> 00:25:53.758]  It was first released by Anonymous, but totally verified through a number of different agencies.
[00:25:53.798 --> 00:25:54.779]  Well, we know this keeps happening.
[00:25:54.799 --> 00:26:03.684]  It's why Apple aren't saints, but they're saying, we put back doors in, everyone's going to get them, and then we're going to be a crap platform like PC.
[00:26:04.985 --> 00:26:08.187]  Well, the FBI agent last night had the nerve, Alex, to say,
[00:26:08.689 --> 00:26:10.191]  We are trying to protect you.
[00:26:10.631 --> 00:26:13.935]  You have to give up privacy and personal freedoms in order to get that.
[00:26:14.136 --> 00:26:15.898]  It's like saying, someday you may be raped.
[00:26:16.038 --> 00:26:18.881]  So we're going to gang rape you with 300, you know, men.
[00:26:20.543 --> 00:26:21.004]  Absolutely.
[00:26:21.044 --> 00:26:25.830]  So, so, but I think by the end of that interview, I had, I had completely trashed him.
[00:26:27.329 --> 00:26:33.975]  My first interview on RT about the Apple FBI thing got over a half million views on my YouTube channel.
[00:26:34.055 --> 00:26:37.638]  I want to get into, you're the computer expert, I want to hear what you think about this, Obamacare.
[00:26:37.878 --> 00:26:40.140]  I'm supporting you for president because you'll educate folks.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.541]  I just hope you don't take too much away from Trump.
[00:26:41.701 --> 00:26:42.702]  But I support both of you.
[00:26:42.722 --> 00:26:43.603]  I support Mavericks.
[00:26:43.903 --> 00:26:45.364]  That doesn't mean I've got to support one person.
[00:26:45.384 --> 00:26:46.185]  I mean, that's why you're on.
[00:26:46.505 --> 00:26:48.147]  But getting into Trump, it's newsworthy.
[00:26:48.447 --> 00:26:51.369]  Give us your take on Donald Trump and why you say you're going to mop the floor with him.
[00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:52.130]  John McAfee.
[00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:58.895]  I'll mop the floor with whoever is the Democratic nominee vs. Alex because they deserve to be mopped with.
[00:27:00.116 --> 00:27:01.157]  But there's a couple things.
[00:27:02.077 --> 00:27:02.898]  I like Trump.
[00:27:02.918 --> 00:27:09.203]  Trump is a nice guy and he certainly galvanized and solidified a massive base of Americans.
[00:27:10.211 --> 00:27:14.976]  But there's certain things that, yeah, he wants to build his wall and build it higher, but look at the truth of this, Alex.
[00:27:14.996 --> 00:27:22.284]  You're wanting to build a wall between our country and a nation of the finest tunnel builders on the planet.
[00:27:22.725 --> 00:27:23.686]  This is the facts of it.
[00:27:23.766 --> 00:27:25.308]  Don't make it obsolete overnight.
[00:27:25.368 --> 00:27:27.690]  I mean, it is a stunt, him saying, build a wall.
[00:27:28.547 --> 00:27:28.767]  It is.
[00:27:29.468 --> 00:27:36.434]  Other than that, I mean, and actually, I don't like the style of the politics in either the Democratic or the Republican Party.
[00:27:36.454 --> 00:27:43.220]  I mean, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are up there pointing fingers at each other about the way they apply their makeup before they do the debate.
[00:27:44.081 --> 00:27:46.182]  Honest to God, Alex, we have problems in this country.
[00:27:46.262 --> 00:27:48.785]  And Rubio's talking about Trump's wee-wee not being big.
[00:27:49.846 --> 00:27:50.246]  I'm sorry?
[00:27:50.266 --> 00:27:53.349]  Rubio's talking about Donald Trump's package.
[00:27:54.448 --> 00:27:55.469]  Yeah, right.
[00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:56.549]  His fingers are short and stubby.
[00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:57.129]  I agree.
[00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:58.910]  But both of them are doing the same thing.
[00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:08.195]  And so, honestly, do you think other nations in the world are respecting us by the way the Democrats and the Republicans are doing their political machine?
[00:28:08.255 --> 00:28:09.296]  No, I don't think so.
[00:28:09.516 --> 00:28:10.576]  We look like fools, Alex.
[00:28:10.876 --> 00:28:12.117]  And forget the other nations.
[00:28:12.737 --> 00:28:14.078]  I think the American people.
[00:28:14.418 --> 00:28:16.399]  You know, the fact that we are putting up with it.
[00:28:16.419 --> 00:28:17.980]  Why don't we demand some seriousness?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.141]  I want to know what everybody stands for.
[00:28:20.501 --> 00:28:23.563]  What are you going to do about cybersecurity?
[00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:26.423]  About immigration, about the economy.
[00:28:26.763 --> 00:28:29.164]  What are you going to do about our bloated government?
[00:28:29.604 --> 00:28:32.585]  Almost $4 trillion a year down the tubes.
[00:28:32.825 --> 00:28:36.866]  I mean, I've spent over $40 million, paid over $40 million in taxes in my life.
[00:28:37.546 --> 00:28:39.147]  I received nothing from that $40 million.
[00:28:39.207 --> 00:28:40.608]  I don't think you have either, Alex.
[00:28:40.888 --> 00:28:41.828]  What are we doing here?
[00:28:42.508 --> 00:28:43.289]  Let's walk through it.
[00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:44.169]  Let's walk through it.
[00:28:44.569 --> 00:28:46.330]  Let's start out with the Apple situation.
[00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.472]  I have a clip of one of the FBI folks actually out there putting out this info.
[00:28:50.053 --> 00:28:52.494]  And I'm not even going to bash the FBI, but they're lying.
[00:28:53.014 --> 00:28:56.196]  They want Apple to make a piece of software, as you said, that doesn't exist.
[00:28:56.616 --> 00:28:59.358]  Isn't that indentured servitude and sets an incredible precedent?
[00:29:00.267 --> 00:29:02.408]  Yes, it's a violation of the 13th Amendment.
[00:29:02.448 --> 00:29:06.709]  But beyond that, Alex, what they're asking for is a master key when they don't need one.
[00:29:06.929 --> 00:29:09.209]  They just have one phone that says, please give us the information.
[00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.950]  I offered to do it for the FBI for free, assuming they could not.
[00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:18.472]  And I did it on CNN, on CNBC, on CBS, on Larry King Live.
[00:29:18.892 --> 00:29:23.256]  On RT, I wrote an article for Business Insider that had 2 million readers.
[00:29:23.576 --> 00:29:24.837]  And I said, I'll do this for free.
[00:29:24.897 --> 00:29:26.959]  And explain to people, you just go around it.
[00:29:26.999 --> 00:29:28.059]  You don't go through the encryption.
[00:29:28.079 --> 00:29:33.123]  And for those that don't know or understand this, they can also get the data from the phone company and the ISP.
[00:29:33.323 --> 00:29:34.745]  So it's a total red herring from the FBI.
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.300]  Completely.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:45.823]  And James Comey lied under oath to Congress yesterday when they asked him directly, have you contacted everybody who has offered assistance with this problem?
[00:29:46.243 --> 00:29:53.945]  Well, if he didn't know I've offered assistance, then he's either living in a barn or the people working for him have not notified him.
[00:29:53.965 --> 00:29:57.926]  Because I had a discussion with an FBI agent last night where I said,
[00:29:58.546 --> 00:30:01.707]  Your director lied under oath to Congress.
[00:30:02.087 --> 00:30:03.168]  No one contacted me.
[00:30:03.588 --> 00:30:07.549]  And if he did not know that I was offering assistance, I'm not believing it, Alex.
[00:30:07.849 --> 00:30:09.250]  The rest of the world sure as hell knew.
[00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:12.331]  You were on every news channel out there.
[00:30:12.351 --> 00:30:12.771]  It was huge.
[00:30:13.953 --> 00:30:17.937]  Yes, so he lied under oath to Congress.
[00:30:17.977 --> 00:30:20.420]  Now that's how badly they want this key, Alex.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.984]  Now, lying under oath to Congress, it doesn't matter why you're lying, it's a serious penalty.
[00:30:25.184 --> 00:30:30.490]  They don't want to get warrants to go to the phone company, the ISP, or have computer people break open the phones individually.
[00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:34.214]  They want the master quick key to do it remotely to millions of phones at once.
[00:30:35.181 --> 00:30:38.243]  It's not remotely necessarily, but this is the beginning, Alex.
[00:30:38.303 --> 00:30:47.747]  If they give them the key to break into every iPhone on the planet, the next thing they're going to go to Google and say, we want to do the same thing with Android, which is 95% of the market.
[00:30:48.108 --> 00:30:51.649]  And the next thing you know, we have no safety, we have no privacy, we have no security.
[00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:56.492]  And once you've given that key or created that key, the FBI can't keep it.
[00:30:57.028 --> 00:31:00.371]  Well, they're trying to make it an issue of privacy versus security.
[00:31:00.431 --> 00:31:02.192]  And privacy is certainly an issue.
[00:31:02.513 --> 00:31:05.195]  But I knew that's what they would say, so I never mentioned privacy.
[00:31:05.575 --> 00:31:14.783]  I talked about the insecurity they would create to the American citizens by making Apple create a master key, which is going to get into the public within a matter of weeks.
[00:31:15.203 --> 00:31:23.318]  And if the public has the master key, then while your daughter is showering, if her phone is on the console, the Chinese or black hat hackers can be watching her.
[00:31:23.539 --> 00:31:24.761]  They're gonna steal our credit cards.
[00:31:25.142 --> 00:31:26.404]  They're emptying our bank accounts.
[00:31:26.444 --> 00:31:27.847]  They will steal our identities.
[00:31:28.188 --> 00:31:29.868]  This is what you're asking us to accept.
[00:31:30.348 --> 00:31:37.030]  And the FBI agent I was talking to last night kept repeating, well, it's, you know, you have to give up some privacy to get security.
[00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.850]  I said, sir, I haven't mentioned privacy.
[00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:49.772]  So he came prepared to talk about privacy, not about an issue which is far more urgent, which is he's making us far more insecure by asking Apple to do this.
[00:31:50.072 --> 00:31:50.812]  It is absurd.
[00:31:51.132 --> 00:31:52.852]  We're doing this to help you and make you secure.
[00:31:53.132 --> 00:31:57.093]  But now your entire lives are going to be monitored by the entire world.
[00:31:57.373 --> 00:31:59.075]  That's not making me any more secure, Alex.
[00:32:01.137 --> 00:32:04.960]  Imagine what will happen if master encryption keys start getting made.
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.803]  As Apple points out, they don't even have this to get into the phone itself.
[00:32:08.143 --> 00:32:09.865]  They just have it on the encryption for communication.
[00:32:10.645 --> 00:32:12.527]  This president said it's a Pandora's box.
[00:32:12.687 --> 00:32:14.229]  What is the FBI thinking?
[00:32:14.249 --> 00:32:20.755]  By the way, France has come out today and wants to fine Apple 1 million euros each time it refuses to decrypt an iPhone.
[00:32:22.438 --> 00:32:28.923]  Well, you know, this is the problem with politics, and this is the problem with bureaucrats, is that everybody's seeking more and more power.
[00:32:29.443 --> 00:32:31.664]  And how can the FBI gain more power?
[00:32:31.945 --> 00:32:38.189]  It can gain more power, Alex, by knowing everything about everybody in America at all times.
[00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:39.470]  This is the power that they want.
[00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:41.111]  Well, I don't want them to have that power.
[00:32:41.291 --> 00:32:41.732]  I'm sorry.
[00:32:41.972 --> 00:32:49.257]  They don't deserve it, and it's unconstitutional, and it violates our own individual human rights.
[00:33:02.148 --> 00:33:03.789]  The Knowledge of the Ancients.
[00:33:04.129 --> 00:33:07.672]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:33:07.932 --> 00:33:10.554]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:33:10.874 --> 00:33:14.316]  Introducing the all new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:33:14.516 --> 00:33:18.199]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts.
[00:33:18.359 --> 00:33:19.180]  We're good to go!
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:47.821]  We're good.
[00:34:02.042 --> 00:34:08.204]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:34:08.224 --> 00:34:11.526]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:34:11.546 --> 00:34:13.286]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:34:13.326 --> 00:34:19.589]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:34:19.689 --> 00:34:25.611]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:34:25.751 --> 00:34:29.514]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:34:29.694 --> 00:34:32.637]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:34:32.777 --> 00:34:40.803]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:34:41.064 --> 00:34:43.105]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:34:43.145 --> 00:34:44.286]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:34:44.566 --> 00:34:46.248]  It's more vital than ever.
[00:34:46.408 --> 00:34:46.888]  I'm good to go.

[00:37:23.504 --> 00:37:30.506]  Interesting article from the BBC, apparently targeted towards people that have been living in a cave for the past five years.
[00:37:30.866 --> 00:37:40.709]  NATO's US General Philip Breedlove claims Russia and Syria are weaponizing migration to destabilize and undermine the continent.
[00:37:41.069 --> 00:37:46.151]  He also suggested that criminals, extremists and fighters were hiding in the flow of migrants.
[00:37:46.511 --> 00:38:03.375]  This, after the United Nations, European leaders and NATO itself supported the mass exodus causing countries like Sweden and Norway to the brink of collapse and no recourse other than to violate international laws to protect their national security.
[00:38:03.595 --> 00:38:10.977]  The Daily Mail reported, Angela Merkel has declared she will carry out her damned duty to help refugees.
[00:38:11.557 --> 00:38:17.182]  Despite a poll suggesting 9 out of 10 Germans want a limit on migrants entering the country.
[00:38:17.463 --> 00:38:27.732]  This came as a nationwide poll also suggested that 38% of Germans agreed that a cap should be set on the number of asylum seekers at 200,000 a year.
[00:38:28.212 --> 00:38:34.778]  Already in the new year of 2016, migrant numbers have increased at record levels across Europe and parts of Asia.
[00:38:35.078 --> 00:38:35.559]  In Britain,
[00:38:35.879 --> 00:38:41.485]  Immigrants were awarded £886 million in benefits in just one year.
[00:38:41.785 --> 00:38:52.535]  There are now 8 million foreigners living in the United Kingdom, up 57% in 10 years, as violence continues to increase and a backlash grows.
[00:38:52.936 --> 00:38:54.337]  Paul Joseph Watson writes,
[00:38:54.577 --> 00:39:08.144]  Three teenage girls were sexually harassed by up to 30 Muslim migrants at a German shopping mall last week in another shocking incident that highlights the social consequences being wrought by Angela Merkel's open border policy.
[00:39:08.444 --> 00:39:10.785]  FDP faction leader Wolfgang Kubicki
[00:39:11.025 --> 00:39:25.629]  Asserted that the incident served as a wake-up call that the country's open border immigration policy was failing, calling it the opposite of integration and an example of how parallel societies are being created in Germany as a result of the migrant influx.
[00:39:26.009 --> 00:39:30.931]  The entire process has become a dismal failure with nefarious undertones.
[00:39:31.491 --> 00:39:40.894]  Even xenophobic Japan gave Sanctuary a try, only to have two of the handful of migrants admitted to Japan to have already committed rape.
[00:39:41.294 --> 00:39:46.635]  Now NATO General Breedlove is complaining that ISIS is spreading like cancer among the refugees.
[00:39:46.976 --> 00:39:55.378]  Clearly an attempt to fool the public into believing that NATO's authority will somehow allow them to escape the blame as Europe implodes.
[00:39:55.678 --> 00:40:03.160]  This is all a sign that the soft and hidden social engineering of billionaire George Soros is all going according to the plan.
[00:40:14.244 --> 00:40:18.748]  An orderly decline of the dollar is actually desirable.
[00:40:19.088 --> 00:40:21.210]  And Soros is only getting started.
[00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:30.016]  Steve Watson writes, Billionaire puppet master George Soros visited the White House toward the end of last year to meet with Obama's top advisor on ISIS.
[00:40:30.397 --> 00:40:40.625]  Before he was appointed, White House logs have revealed, Soros' trip to the White House marked the 13th time that he has visited since Obama has been in office.
[00:40:40.925 --> 00:40:48.935]  Will it take the growing awareness of a majority of angry Americans to wake up or even come to Europe's rescue once again?
[00:40:49.296 --> 00:40:55.664]  How long before George Soros is outed for the nation-wrecking enemy of humanity he truly is?
[00:40:56.184 --> 00:40:58.047]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:41:11.792 --> 00:41:13.793]  And another excellent report from John Bowne.
[00:41:13.933 --> 00:41:18.634]  I would like to remind you about our new product, Joint Formula, available in the InfoWars shop.
[00:41:18.954 --> 00:41:21.815]  The daily wear and tear of life takes a toll on your joints.

[00:41:27.637 --> 00:41:29.798]  I want to talk to you about something a little bit different.
[00:41:30.618 --> 00:41:38.120]  Doing a lot of reports about technology, and technology can be a very good thing, but there also are the robots and the robotics that are replacing human labor.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.981]  And if you say this is completely impractical, think about Blockbuster.
[00:41:42.161 --> 00:41:45.422]  Now think about Redbox and how Redbox replaced Blockbuster.
[00:41:45.862 --> 00:41:46.983]  And not everything is bad.
[00:41:47.003 --> 00:41:51.328]  You know, you have factory jobs that were once very dangerous, being performed by robots.
[00:41:51.649 --> 00:41:54.552]  But once again, those are human beings that no longer have a job.
[00:41:54.592 --> 00:41:56.594]  Their job is to maintain those robots.
[00:41:56.895 --> 00:42:01.560]  So here's a special report about that, as well as how socialism is destroying our economy.
[00:42:02.659 --> 00:42:04.740]  The $15 National Minimum Wage Hike.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.101]  Is this a good idea?
[00:42:06.461 --> 00:42:08.102]  Or another recipe for disaster?
[00:42:08.442 --> 00:42:15.926]  If you ask a Bernie Sanders supporter, they will explain that this new wage requirement is exactly what the country needs in order to make it a more fair place to live.
[00:42:16.546 --> 00:42:19.487]  And that's the centerpiece of Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign.
[00:42:19.887 --> 00:42:22.929]  A national $15 per hour minimum wage requirement.
[00:42:23.149 --> 00:42:25.770]  Bernie's campaign page lists this as one of his issues.
[00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:26.890]  A living wage.
[00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:30.611]  Sanders says millions of Americans are working for total inadequate wages.
[00:42:30.871 --> 00:42:33.812]  We must ensure that no full-time worker lives in poverty.
[00:42:34.192 --> 00:42:38.333]  The current federal minimum wage is starvation pay and must become a living wage.
[00:42:38.513 --> 00:42:41.754]  We must increase it to $15 an hour over the next several years.
[00:42:42.034 --> 00:42:45.615]  This statement sounds good as nobody likes to see others who are doing their best suffer.
[00:42:45.815 --> 00:42:48.736]  But a fine-sounding statement and an effective working policy
[00:42:49.056 --> 00:42:50.257]  Are entirely different beasts.
[00:42:50.577 --> 00:42:55.622]  Will a $15 minimum living wage actually ease some of the poverty that many suffer across America?
[00:42:55.782 --> 00:42:57.883]  Or will the effects of that policy lead to the opposite?
[00:42:58.264 --> 00:43:01.566]  A spread of poverty throughout the country at an unprecedented rate.
[00:43:02.027 --> 00:43:06.971]  Countless economists and historians have expressed their concerns over the Democratic Socialist minimum wage plan.
[00:43:07.371 --> 00:43:12.876]  In May 2014, Seattle set their minimum wage at $15 an hour starting in April over the next year.
[00:43:13.096 --> 00:43:17.880]  Forbes magazine predicts that the wage hike will lead to slower job growth as well as lower quality production.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:24.245]  Earlier this month, Investors Business Daily analyzed the results of six cities that increased their minimum wage to $10 or more.
[00:43:24.625 --> 00:43:32.210]  The latest data show that job gains ground to a halt in the nation's capital in 2015, and that was a sharp drop from the 3% annual job gains in 2014.
[00:43:33.231 --> 00:43:37.652]  Meaning restaurants, hotels, and other employers went from adding 2,000 jobs to adding zero.
[00:43:37.973 --> 00:43:41.454]  And that's a city already saddled with a 6.6% jobless rate.
[00:43:41.594 --> 00:43:46.535]  The timing of this zero job gain coincides with a $1 minimum wage hike to $10.50 an hour last July.
[00:43:48.416 --> 00:43:54.040]  And then there's Chicago that raised its minimum rate to $10.50 an hour, not $15 like Sanders proposes nationwide.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.801]  And already their job market is frozen.
[00:43:55.981 --> 00:43:57.562]  People have stopped hiring.
[00:43:57.822 --> 00:44:02.125]  The Business Daily article shows similar data across five cities who all raised their minimum wage.
[00:44:02.305 --> 00:44:11.692]  But facts and data are no fun, especially to a Bernie Sanders supporter who seems to feel that the government is there to make everything fair for everyone, regardless of the economy.
[00:44:11.972 --> 00:44:13.133]  The facts prove otherwise.
[00:44:13.353 --> 00:44:18.156]  With a mandated minimum wage raise, employment slows down and production quality also suffers.
[00:44:18.496 --> 00:44:21.777]  Now add this to the equation, the reality of a robotic workforce.
[00:44:22.177 --> 00:44:25.258]  Unlike human labor, robots do not require a break or sleep.
[00:44:25.478 --> 00:44:29.058]  They might break down once in a while, but they will not get sick or ask for a raise.
[00:44:29.338 --> 00:44:34.039]  They will not need vacation time, and they will be able to outperform almost any laborer at their profession.
[00:44:34.339 --> 00:44:37.220]  And all that for one low price, compared to their human counterparts.
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:41.701]  New headlines appear almost daily, boasting about the impending technology shift.
[00:44:42.101 --> 00:44:45.382]  Remember, these robots are not just the clunky assembly line models.
[00:44:45.942 --> 00:44:48.266]  The task these robots can perform will shock many.
[00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:56.158]  A $15 an hour national minimum wage might usher in the robotic labor age with a fast food serving labor force, but it won't end there.
[00:44:56.398 --> 00:45:01.566]  Looking out in the future, the next phase of these robots won't just be physical labor, but mental labor as well.
[00:45:01.826 --> 00:45:07.289]  Those high-paying jobs that many of us went into debt to get with our college degrees will also be off the market.
[00:45:07.549 --> 00:45:12.731]  Some say this automated economy is a reality that is going to happen with or without a national minimum wage hike.
[00:45:13.112 --> 00:45:13.472]  Perhaps.
[00:45:13.932 --> 00:45:20.695]  We will never know what the free market defines as a desirable product when the government steps in and alters the market with its own mandate and expenses.
[00:45:21.075 --> 00:45:30.380]  If all of these regulations interfere with the normal profit margin and new laws on labor prices cripple the process altogether, then a robot worker, regardless of the profession, will be the only choice.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:34.742]  It is already difficult for entrepreneurs to get started in our bureaucratically run economy.
[00:45:35.043 --> 00:45:43.067]  While the taxes, permits, lawyers, and a rise in labor costs by upwards of 60%, the government is basically force-feeding us into a robotic reality.
[00:45:43.227 --> 00:45:47.370]  So Bernie Sanders supporters out there should rethink the Sanders living wage platform.
[00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:51.192]  Because a living wage just might end up killing the human workforce.
[00:45:51.392 --> 00:45:54.694]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:46:07.802 --> 00:46:17.367]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:46:17.827 --> 00:46:19.548]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:46:19.728 --> 00:46:20.289]  Think about it.
[00:46:20.489 --> 00:46:26.252]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:46:26.532 --> 00:46:32.095]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:46:32.475 --> 00:46:44.247]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:46:44.507 --> 00:46:47.290]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:49.953]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:46:50.273 --> 00:46:54.718]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:46:55.158 --> 00:46:55.719]  Think about it.
[00:46:55.919 --> 00:47:07.118]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[00:47:15.953 --> 00:47:18.915]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.195 --> 00:47:19.335]  Right?
[00:47:19.355 --> 00:47:21.717]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.077 --> 00:47:25.600]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.802]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.282 --> 00:47:34.086]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.626 --> 00:47:36.508]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.848 --> 00:47:41.251]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:43.069]  We're good to go.
[00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:10.535]  I guess the question that everybody is asking is, who is Marco Rubio?
[00:49:10.575 --> 00:49:12.517]  And of course, you've got one kind of answer for us.
[00:49:12.998 --> 00:49:18.224]  We've seen that Marco Rubio changed radically after he was elected with his Gang of Eight.
[00:49:18.264 --> 00:49:20.547]  We saw a lot of revelations about that this weekend.
[00:49:20.887 --> 00:49:24.212]  The New York Times talking about how Marco Rubio was the point man.
[00:49:24.252 --> 00:49:25.974]  And of course, this is something that's been known for a while.
[00:49:26.434 --> 00:49:40.185]  But they did a very detailed expose about how he went to Fox News, talked to Rupert Murdoch, Roger Ailes, as essentially an ambassador to get Fox News to go along with him on the amnesty bill, talking to a lot of conservative talk radio hosts.
[00:49:40.565 --> 00:49:43.547]  Many of them are pushing back on that narrative.
[00:49:43.607 --> 00:49:44.108]  Nevertheless,
[00:49:45.508 --> 00:49:48.870]  It almost passed, and it truly is amazing that it didn't pass.
[00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:57.974]  Kind of a miracle that it didn't pass, considering how Fox News was sympathetic to it, so many conservative talk show hosts were sympathetic to it.
[00:49:58.214 --> 00:50:07.818]  Because we opposed it, the grassroots opposed it, and Marco Rubio has really become an anathema to anybody who was really paying attention to it.
[00:50:07.858 --> 00:50:10.199]  But tell us about your opinion of Marco Rubio.
[00:50:10.839 --> 00:50:12.479]  Well, he's obviously a neocon.
[00:50:12.519 --> 00:50:13.220]  I've been watching
[00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:20.078]  The Virginia returns this evening, and I know that the networks are not going to be calling.
[00:50:20.098 --> 00:50:28.589]  They're not calling Virginia for Trump, but if you look at the returns from Virginia, you see that the only counties where Marco Rubio is winning
[00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:33.313]  Are the counties in the Northern Virginia and in the D.C.
[00:50:33.373 --> 00:50:33.893]  suburbs.
[00:50:34.894 --> 00:50:36.555]  Look, Rubio's a neocon.
[00:50:36.655 --> 00:50:41.337]  The people who are voting for him in Northern Virginia are neocon Republicans.
[00:50:41.417 --> 00:50:51.824]  They either work for the federal government and they live in Northern Virginia, in Arlington County, Alexandria, Falls Church, Fairfax County, Loudoun County.
[00:50:53.405 --> 00:50:55.646]  This is the Rubio territory this evening.
[00:50:56.887 --> 00:50:58.388]  I would note, and Fairfax County.
[00:50:58.948 --> 00:51:02.770]  This is where many of these neocon think tanks have their offices.
[00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:05.691]  So the people not only live there, they work there.
[00:51:05.812 --> 00:51:19.018]  We also know that the log cabin Republicans, the gay Republicans, you know, have been working overtime to help their, you know, their comrade-in-arms, so to speak, Marco, in this election.
[00:51:19.678 --> 00:51:25.481]  And again, the Northern Virginia Republican Party is heavy with log cabin Republicans.
[00:51:25.501 --> 00:51:28.423]  They're either out of the closet or they're still in the closet.
[00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:30.711]  What do you think so far of what we're seeing?
[00:51:30.731 --> 00:51:38.039]  We still haven't seen Virginia being called for Donald Trump with 80% of the votes, and I haven't seen the percentages really fluctuate on here.
[00:51:38.099 --> 00:51:44.767]  It stayed about 36, 37% all night with Marco Rubio at 30, 31%, Ted Cruz at 17 or 18%.
[00:51:44.827 --> 00:51:48.311]  It's still about there, but they're not calling it for Donald Trump.
[00:51:48.391 --> 00:51:49.172]  Your comments on that.
[00:51:49.212 --> 00:51:50.213]  Why do you think they're waiting so long?
[00:51:50.333 --> 00:52:00.485]  Well, if you analyze this, let's take Virginia, the northern Virginia, the Washington suburbs, if you will, are of course the home of the liberal Republicans and the establishment Republicans.
[00:52:01.406 --> 00:52:09.375]  The Henrico Chesterfield area in the second ring outside of Richmond is kind of Reagan country, very conservative.
[00:52:09.395 --> 00:52:11.057]  Of course, the rest of the state, other than
[00:52:11.557 --> 00:52:21.039]  Newport News and the Norfolk area, which is generally heavily Democratic, but also heavily military-induced.
[00:52:21.739 --> 00:52:23.740]  What we're seeing tonight is the same trend over and over.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:29.121]  Look, what you see is this classic pattern, but there are some interesting things.
[00:52:29.501 --> 00:52:33.622]  Arkansas, closer than expected tonight, down from narrowly out front.
[00:52:34.122 --> 00:52:36.423]  Virginia appears to be competitive.
[00:52:36.903 --> 00:52:43.587]  Oklahoma appears to be a dogfight because Ted Cruz, to a certain extent, is draining Donald Trump, but Trump's still ahead.
[00:52:43.607 --> 00:52:49.531]  Now, interestingly, these are three of the states where we got complaints about irregularities.
[00:52:49.571 --> 00:52:52.793]  We got a lot of complaints today about people
[00:52:53.533 --> 00:52:57.755]  Attempting to cast their vote for Trump in some cases, the lever wouldn't move.
[00:52:57.795 --> 00:53:00.256]  In other cases, the vote would be registered for Rubio.
[00:53:00.976 --> 00:53:08.520]  We hastily organized some lawyers and activists with some experience, some election judges.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.901]  To go look at these situations.
[00:53:11.201 --> 00:53:22.526]  We also had complaints from the number of Trump supporters in Ohio pertaining to their absentee ballot collection and their early voting efforts.
[00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:27.688]  So, look, the establishment is not above stealing this from Donald Trump.
[00:53:28.108 --> 00:53:32.370]  I have always been one who thought computerized voting needs to be watched very carefully.
[00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:34.511]  I think there's a lot of evidence that Karl Rove
[00:53:35.231 --> 00:53:42.733]  David, I was going to just basically add the piece that you guys aired earlier is just a case example, forget Donald Trump, of globalist programming.
[00:54:05.413 --> 00:54:07.795]  Basically rejected the Klan in 2001.
[00:54:08.235 --> 00:54:08.415]  Yeah.
[00:54:08.956 --> 00:54:09.436]  Himself.
[00:54:09.476 --> 00:54:11.878]  He said, I'm leaving the Reform Party because David Duke sent it.
[00:54:12.438 --> 00:54:15.561]  Then they cut his audio off, a classic tactic to confuse him.
[00:54:15.601 --> 00:54:17.082]  He said, who, what groups?
[00:54:17.122 --> 00:54:18.463]  David, David who?
[00:54:19.524 --> 00:54:23.327]  Then he just gave a speech earlier, just 10 minutes ago.
[00:54:23.347 --> 00:54:26.289]  He's up to give him one right now, where they said again, will you disavow?
[00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:27.390]  And he went, boom.
[00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:30.412]  And he laid out six times he's disavowed
[00:54:31.087 --> 00:54:31.167]  Yeah.
[00:54:31.187 --> 00:54:32.248]  But they want him to get it.
[00:54:32.268 --> 00:54:32.448]  Yeah.
[00:54:58.047 --> 00:55:00.748]  It's not that Trump's perfect or even a good guy.
[00:55:00.768 --> 00:55:01.368]  It doesn't matter.
[00:55:01.868 --> 00:55:10.050]  This is the whole power structure against him and the Koch brothers put all their energy in the Republican Party and Fox News behind Marco Rubio and he is imploding right now.
[00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:14.171]  So, this is good news for the awakening.
[00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:17.232]  I don't know if we were the first to say it six months ago, but now it's all over the news.
[00:55:18.552 --> 00:55:19.332]  This is a movement.
[00:55:19.792 --> 00:55:20.813]  This is an insurrection.
[00:55:20.833 --> 00:55:21.853]  People don't buy the system.
[00:55:23.028 --> 00:55:23.168]  Right.
[00:55:42.984 --> 00:55:43.324]  I don't know.
[00:56:09.375 --> 00:56:11.137]  We know the globalists are bad news.
[00:56:11.557 --> 00:56:12.898]  We just gotta keep Donald Trump honest.
[00:56:12.938 --> 00:56:15.721]  But the reason they've shifted to nothing but racial politics with him...
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.882]  Is because they now know he's going to win the nomination.
[00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:20.723]  They now know he's going to get the delegates.
[00:56:21.263 --> 00:56:29.288]  And they want to either demonize him and say, well, he deserves to have it taken away with Paul Ryan and the Republican leadership, you know, basically coming out and demonizing him.
[00:56:29.788 --> 00:56:36.812]  Or so they can basically try to get Hillary in on the back of, quote, racism again and claiming that he hates women.
[00:56:37.133 --> 00:56:41.195]  And they've been pre-programming that with Megyn Kelly and everybody else the whole time.
[00:56:41.235 --> 00:56:42.516]  You know, Marco Rubio could say,
[00:56:43.194 --> 00:56:46.455]  You know, he's got little hands and that means he has a little member and all this stuff.
[00:56:46.815 --> 00:56:47.816]  That's all okay.
[00:56:47.856 --> 00:56:53.618]  And, you know, Hillary can call him names, people can call him Hitler, and foreign governments can tell us what to do.
[00:56:54.118 --> 00:57:02.641]  Everything's okay, but a male standing up and saying, we're going to try to have sovereignty and save the country, and they go, oh, he wants protectionism.
[00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:09.817]  As he points out, China has such a low currency rate that it's a giant internal tariff against us.
[00:57:10.257 --> 00:57:16.501]  No environmental standards, slave labor, all of these are unorthodox tariffs.
[00:57:16.521 --> 00:57:19.503]  You put our regulations and controls in, it's impossible.
[00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:28.068]  And now the last jobs, I mean literally we've lost more than 60% of our industrial base and that's our base to operate as a sovereign nation.
[00:57:28.408 --> 00:57:30.749]  Now that last 40% is eroding.
[00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:33.051]  Within three years, I've seen numbers in the Wall Street Journal,
[00:57:33.874 --> 00:57:34.914]  We'll be down to 10%.
[00:57:35.755 --> 00:57:39.376]  We are absolutely being dismantled.
[00:57:39.897 --> 00:57:40.397]  For real.
[00:57:40.437 --> 00:57:41.117]  That's not words.
[00:57:41.177 --> 00:57:42.338]  I mean, literally.
[00:57:42.618 --> 00:57:45.839]  I use that word so much because, I mean, I'm not, this is not hyperbole.
[00:57:45.879 --> 00:57:50.861]  We are literally being turned into a cashless fiat system for total control.
[00:57:51.181 --> 00:57:52.502]  We are being dismantled.
[00:57:52.542 --> 00:57:54.663]  We are being shut down right now.
[00:57:54.983 --> 00:57:57.644]  And the reason Donald Trump's good, whether he's a good guy or not,
[00:57:58.528 --> 00:58:09.117]  He's exposing globalism as a deindustrialization tool to consolidate control and sign us on to foreign treaties that are outside of our sovereignty.
[00:58:09.197 --> 00:58:10.178]  We have been conquered.
[00:58:10.518 --> 00:58:11.539]  We have been occupied.
[00:58:11.559 --> 00:58:13.461]  He's now starting to talk about that in letters.
[00:58:13.881 --> 00:58:15.422]  He's about to start talking about that in public.
[00:58:15.743 --> 00:58:20.827]  And as I've said a hundred times, this is game over when the people realize the full horror
[00:58:21.856 --> 00:58:22.937]  And people say, well that's scary.
[00:58:23.097 --> 00:58:24.038]  What's good about the full heart?
[00:58:24.458 --> 00:58:26.619]  Admitting the crisis.
[00:58:26.659 --> 00:58:31.303]  If you've got a broken leg with a compound fracture, if you deny it and try to walk on it, it's going to get worse.
[00:58:31.323 --> 00:58:32.483]  You're going to get gangrene and die.
[00:58:33.024 --> 00:58:38.548]  Admitting we've got a compound fracture, going in for emergency surgery, we could be back on our feet in a month.
[00:58:38.828 --> 00:58:40.249]  If we don't, we're going to die.
[00:58:41.647 --> 00:58:42.968]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.
