[00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:22.009]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:25.970]  It is Thursday, March 31st, 2016, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.371]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:37.875]  Tonight, a top researcher claims ISIS may soon have nuclear capabilities.
[00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:41.997]  Then, Hillary has a date with the Feds.
[00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:47.279]  After that, the DC Madam sports an impressive clientele list.
[00:00:48.544 --> 00:00:50.485]  And are student loans getting you down?
[00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:55.088]  Well, you can apply right away to be a professional protester.
[00:00:55.668 --> 00:00:56.449]  That's next.
[00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:58.770]  Yeah, yeah, keep blinking.
[00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.210]  He's right.
[00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:00.531]  Put him in the back as well.
[00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:01.132]  Are you okay?
[00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:07.327]  Not so fast.
[00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:09.688]  Your friend might be crazy.
[00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:11.869]  It's a f***ing circus, everybody!
[00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:12.269]  Look!
[00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.649]  Look!
[00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:14.090]  Look at the monkey!
[00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.210]  Look at the monkey!
[00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.052]  I did that on purpose!
[00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:19.972]  It's all a f***ing show here!

[00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:09.006]  Well, a notable Harvard researcher is making the claim that ISIS could be planning a nuclear attack very soon.
[00:03:09.447 --> 00:03:19.116]  Now, experts say that the prospect of this is highly unlikely, but we are hearing a lot of rumbling of potential nuclear attacks, and of course today is the nuclear summit.
[00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.018]  So this is Harvard researcher Matthew Bunn.
[00:03:22.198 --> 00:03:28.944]  He's claiming that the Islamic State might engage in three different kinds of nuclear or radiological terrorism in the near future.
[00:03:29.845 --> 00:03:37.128]  He says that they could attack a nuclear facility and blow it up, explode a dirty bomb, or somehow develop a nuclear bomb and detonate it.
[00:03:37.908 --> 00:03:40.609]  Now experts are saying that this is highly unlikely.
[00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.349]  You can't build a functioning bomb.
[00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.031]  It's not something you would just gin up with spare parts and power tools in your garage.
[00:03:47.651 --> 00:04:06.568]  So, they say instead of a full-fledged nuclear attack, authorities are anticipating that they could use a dirty bomb that is made out of radiological materials pilfered from hospitals, research facilities, industrial activities, and construction sites, or they could also attack a power plant and trigger a nuclear meltdown.
[00:04:07.028 --> 00:04:10.531]  Now, James Acton, who's a director of the Nuclear Policy Program,
[00:04:11.492 --> 00:04:15.393]  Says that nuclear fuel is not very radioactive before it's used.
[00:04:15.493 --> 00:04:16.633]  It would need to be enriched.
[00:04:17.373 --> 00:04:24.475]  Nuclear waste is described as self-protecting because it is so highly radioactive that it would kill anyone who tried to steal it.
[00:04:25.055 --> 00:04:31.197]  And again, they're saying that it would be much more likely that they would attack a nuclear facility and trigger a nuclear meltdown.
[00:04:31.677 --> 00:04:40.359]  Now he goes on to say, however, it would take, you know, more than one bomb and knowledge of how the plant works, making the success rate for something like this highly unlikely for untrained terrorists.
[00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:52.972]  But this is what is pretty frightening in light of what happened in Brussels after they were able to raid some of the terrorist apartments there that took place in the Paris terror attacks.
[00:04:53.312 --> 00:05:03.203]  They found out that a very senior official at one of these Belgian nuclear facilities was actually being surveilled by these terrorists that carried out the Brussels attack.
[00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:12.948]  Now, there have been no official confirmation, but there are real fears that the Brussels cell of the Islamic State terror group may have been plotting this radioactive nuclear bomb attack.
[00:05:13.028 --> 00:05:26.676]  And since then, the media is reporting that 11 workers at the nuclear power plant about 40 miles southeast of Brussels have had their access badges withdrawn over fears that jihadists might be seeking insider help.
[00:05:27.336 --> 00:05:36.704]  And additional soldiers have also been deployed now to protect Belgium's two atomic power plants, a nuclear research facility, and a company that makes medical isotopes.
[00:05:37.184 --> 00:05:45.771]  And the senior Belgian nuclear industry official who was being tracked is someone who's said to have access to these radioactive isotopes.
[00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:48.294]  So it seems like it's really not a matter of if
[00:05:48.874 --> 00:05:49.554]  But when?
[00:05:50.115 --> 00:05:59.959]  And of course the UK and US are going to be simulating a cyber attack on nuclear plants to assess their resilience in light of this.
[00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:03.620]  This is going to be taking place sometime later this year.
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:10.143]  They want to test the readiness of the government and utility firms, make sure that they learn any lessons, and of course
[00:06:10.663 --> 00:06:16.709]  A cyber attack on a nuclear facility could be very important and a major detriment to the infrastructure of our society.
[00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:29.721]  But of course if terrorists are able to get inside of these facilities or get help with people who can help them operate the mechanisms inside of it, they would be able to trigger a nuclear meltdown.
[00:06:29.741 --> 00:06:31.042]  I mean it's just...
[00:06:31.983 --> 00:06:33.504]  This news is just very upsetting.
[00:06:33.764 --> 00:06:41.786]  And now they're saying at least 50 ISIS supporters are working as baggage handlers, cleaners, and catering staff at Brussels Airport.
[00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:54.630]  And we've been seeing different types of terrorist attacks coming out of, say, Egypt and places like that, where they're saying these people and their Islamic State supporters are actually working within these facilities.
[00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.192]  So the simple fact that we now have 11 workers there at a nuclear facility in Belgium getting their
[00:07:00.832 --> 00:07:02.133]  Authorization revoked.
[00:07:04.234 --> 00:07:07.817]  It's definitely getting to be like a see something, say something type thing.
[00:07:07.857 --> 00:07:13.080]  But of course here in America, you're racist if you do that, which is exactly what happened there in San Bernardino.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.283]  The neighbors didn't want to call on all the suspicious packages coming in and out of these people's homes.
[00:07:17.943 --> 00:07:25.868]  France, of course, is now reporting an exodus of its millionaires because these people can see the writing on the wall and they've got enough money to get the heck out of there.
[00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:27.549]  They said more than 10,000 millionaires have
[00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:35.280]  Hit the road, left Paris, following a series of Islamic terrorist attacks there in 2015.
[00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:45.485]  Well, Al Jazeera America says that investigators are very near a verdict on whether or not they're going to seek criminal charges against Hillary Clinton.
[00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:48.726]  Now, this was last night on a newscast.
[00:07:48.746 --> 00:07:55.429]  They reported that the FBI has completed its examination of the Democratic frontrunner and her private email server.
[00:07:56.569 --> 00:07:58.610]  They state that investigators are nearing the verdict.
[00:08:00.151 --> 00:08:07.836]  Potentially, James Comey, the FBI director, is going to be interviewing Hillary Clinton personally in the coming days.
[00:08:08.336 --> 00:08:12.159]  But let's take a look back, you know, how serious are they going to take all of this?
[00:08:12.219 --> 00:08:13.820]  It's just, you know, just some emails.
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.542]  She said it's just her yoga workout and her daughter's wedding and stuff.
[00:08:17.823 --> 00:08:24.207]  Let's take a look at the eight times the Department of Justice under the Obama administration has let bureaucrats off the hook.
[00:08:26.428 --> 00:08:31.069]  Prosecution of public corruption has reached historic lows under President Barack Obama.
[00:08:31.109 --> 00:08:34.450]  It's a 20-year low, in fact, in 2015.
[00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.131]  So we've got an assistant U.S.
[00:08:37.171 --> 00:08:44.933]  attorney who was storing adult and child porn on a government computer, but the DOJ declined to prosecute.
[00:08:45.513 --> 00:08:46.474]  An unnamed U.S.
[00:08:46.554 --> 00:08:51.075]  Fish and Wildlife Service's refuge manager violated anti-lobbying laws.
[00:08:51.115 --> 00:08:53.696]  He was writing a letter to Congress opposing legislation.
[00:08:53.716 --> 00:08:54.616]  Eh, whatever.
[00:08:55.256 --> 00:09:09.372]  Then we have Danny Harris out of the Department of Education, the top technology official, using agency employees for his side business, failed to disclose outside income, and failed to pay taxes on that income for multiple years.
[00:09:09.813 --> 00:09:11.835]  Eh, whatever, if that was you or me, we'd be in prison.
[00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:30.095]  We've got another Secret Service employee giving a shady promotion, former DHS exec breaking post-government employment laws, and of course the whole scandal within the Veterans Affairs and the wait time scandal where at least 40 veterans died waiting for care.
[00:09:30.115 --> 00:09:31.635]  Eh, that's not a big deal.
[00:09:32.036 --> 00:09:37.758]  And then of course Treasury officials soliciting prostitutes, taking bribes from bankers,
[00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:42.157]  And you know, of course, that's in addition to the Secret Service.
[00:09:42.217 --> 00:09:43.358]  And you know what?
[00:09:43.378 --> 00:09:45.299]  It's just another day in D.C.
[00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:51.043]  But speaking of letting bad bureaucrats off the hook, let's look at the D.C.
[00:09:51.083 --> 00:09:51.504]  Madam.
[00:09:51.864 --> 00:10:04.113]  Now, obviously, she, in about 2007, she had threatened to go public with client records following an indictment on racketeering and money laundering charges in connection with her escort service.
[00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:09.237]  And then, of course, she was found suicided, of course.
[00:10:09.657 --> 00:10:18.725]  Well, now her attorney says that he wants to release some phone records that he claims is going to throw a kink in the presidential election.
[00:10:19.225 --> 00:10:30.375]  Now, he's been disbarred, but he's threatening to release one or more names on the steps of the Supreme Court, saying he thinks it's very timely and relevant to the political discourse.
[00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:35.599]  Now, Alex Jones interviewed Wade Madsen, who, of course, had been given
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.962]  Information by the DC Madam before her death.
[00:10:39.302 --> 00:10:47.988]  She said this information would have been of great interest to the 9-11 Commission and some of the things that her escorts were able to learn by overhearing.
[00:10:48.849 --> 00:10:53.732]  Things that she said would have been very important having to do with intelligence that they picked up.
[00:10:58.635 --> 00:11:00.337]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:00.357 --> 00:11:02.338]  Transmission continuing into overdrive.
[00:11:02.618 --> 00:11:03.479]  We do have Wayne Madsen.
[00:11:04.594 --> 00:11:05.795]  Yes, hello Alex.
[00:11:06.316 --> 00:11:12.361]  Sir, we have Miss Britton clearly being murdered, according to her family.
[00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:17.365]  Now, Deborah Jean Palfrey says she would never kill herself, even if she was found guilty, that she would then name names.
[00:11:17.885 --> 00:11:20.087]  And I guess they didn't want the name being named.
[00:11:20.147 --> 00:11:22.990]  I would imagine, buddy, you are in grave danger right now.
[00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:28.294]  Wayne Madsen, worked for the National Security Agency, lives in D.C., runs WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:11:29.815 --> 00:11:32.518]  And do you believe, Palfrey, that she didn't know who these clients were?
[00:11:33.095 --> 00:11:34.636]  I think she knows exactly who they were.
[00:11:34.916 --> 00:11:39.138]  As a matter of fact, remember, most of her clients were in McLean, Virginia.
[00:11:39.458 --> 00:11:40.779]  That was the center of activity.
[00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:46.742]  Thirteen years she had the most discreet escort service in Washington.
[00:11:46.922 --> 00:11:48.162]  Why didn't they leave her alone?
[00:11:48.282 --> 00:11:49.803]  Why are they killing all these women?
[00:11:49.943 --> 00:11:51.084]  They're the ones that called them!
[00:11:51.937 --> 00:11:54.438]  Exactly, and this is how they're cleaning up.
[00:11:54.838 --> 00:11:58.759]  They used them and now they're disposing of them, and it's disgusting.
[00:11:59.199 --> 00:12:13.724]  Obviously the agency, meaning the CIA, used these girls because these were professional, well-educated, these were not barely English-speaking Koreans or people from... Oh, you think it's an intelligence op?
[00:12:13.944 --> 00:12:16.065]  You think these girls were being run by an agency?
[00:12:16.585 --> 00:12:20.988]  I absolutely do, and I feel that... I pressed Jean on that many occasions.
[00:12:21.008 --> 00:12:24.390]  She never told me, but of course she may have made an agreement never to say that.
[00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.651]  So, that makes sense.
[00:12:25.671 --> 00:12:30.414]  Oh, you're saying you believe she was working for a subsection of the U.S., or Israelis, or Russians?
[00:12:30.434 --> 00:12:35.498]  No, no, I believe McLean, Virginia, obviously, is where the CIA is located, I believe.
[00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.859]  But, I mean, so it wasn't subsections.
[00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:38.920]  Well, you know, it's infiltrated.
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.521]  So you believe the U.S.
[00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:43.623]  government was running an operation against U.S.
[00:12:43.843 --> 00:12:44.244]  targets?
[00:12:44.584 --> 00:12:45.665]  Well, she said on this show,
[00:12:46.605 --> 00:12:50.848]  That they were using her as bait to track people?
[00:12:51.449 --> 00:12:55.872]  Oh, I believe that's true, and I believe they were, you know, entrapping Middle Eastern leaders.
[00:12:55.912 --> 00:12:57.293]  We know that they were clients.
[00:12:57.353 --> 00:13:06.239]  We know that Cheney was using them not only for his own predilections, but also to entertain potential customers in the Middle East for Halliburton.
[00:13:06.979 --> 00:13:15.025]  We know that Cheney... I reported today, I reiterated that some of Cheney's top lieutenants at Halliburton and KBR, Kellogg Brown and Root,
[00:13:15.345 --> 00:13:18.206]  And we know about the sexual harassment of KBR people.
[00:13:18.246 --> 00:13:20.607]  This is an awful company, and so is Halliburton.
[00:13:20.787 --> 00:13:30.751]  Well, it came out about the CIA head, Porter Goss, would go to the Watergate, where on one floor you had gambling, the next floor you had the, quote, free hookers.
[00:13:31.591 --> 00:13:34.994]  Uh, so it's just, I mean, why didn't they kill those girls?
[00:13:35.034 --> 00:13:36.295]  I guess they do kill some.
[00:13:36.876 --> 00:13:51.788]  We don't know that they haven't because the Sherlington limousine that was delivering those women to the Watergate and to another hotel in Washington, uh, the Sherlington limousine was transporting Pamela Martin and associates' escorts, the escorts that work for Gene Palfrey.
[00:13:52.842 --> 00:13:56.426]  Do you think these women have any idea how much danger they're in?
[00:13:57.888 --> 00:14:05.158]  Women out there listening, if you're going to be engaged in prostitution, stay far away from Washington and high-powered dignitaries in New York.
[00:14:06.653 --> 00:14:11.314]  Well, with all the Trump rallies coming up, we know there are going to be a lot of protesters out there.
[00:14:11.535 --> 00:14:15.896]  And once again, we are learning that these might be paid protesters.
[00:14:16.416 --> 00:14:23.318]  A pro-Bernie Sanders Craigslist ad invites people in Wisconsin to protest against Donald Trump for $15 an hour.
[00:14:23.398 --> 00:14:31.801]  They say shuttle buses, parking signs, and hourly pay is available, of course, $15 an hour due to economic inequality.
[00:14:32.381 --> 00:14:44.691]  Now, if the ad is real or not, we do know that at least some anti-Trump protesters were recruited via a Craigslist ad prior to the Trump Tower rally that took place earlier this month in New York.
[00:14:45.491 --> 00:14:53.397]  And several people admitted that they had been hired by the Craigslist ad and they were paid $16 an hour for these protests.
[00:14:53.538 --> 00:15:00.443]  And of course, we learned that MoveOn.org was involved with this hiring, which is, of course, funded by billionaire George Soros.
[00:15:00.844 --> 00:15:05.658]  And of course, those protests, which went violent, were then subsequently blamed on Donald Trump.
[00:15:08.857 --> 00:15:22.706]  George Soros, the New World Order hedge fund billionaire, is blatantly raining down millions of dollars on countless liberal organizations in the United States to hijack your freedom of choice with his Open Society foundations.
[00:15:23.066 --> 00:15:37.755]  One of the Soros octopi's tentacles is MoveOn.org, the liberal activist behemoth that grew from Soros' $1.46 million donation as a means to protect Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky impeachment hearings.
[00:15:38.095 --> 00:15:43.119]  MoveOn.org is now a full-blown army of the deluded, violent, and misinformed.
[00:15:43.599 --> 00:15:44.340]  FactCheck.org writes,
[00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:57.949]  MoveOn.org PAC raised and spent $38 million in 2008.
[00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:02.552]  It had spent $21 million during the 2010 campaign cycle.
[00:16:02.652 --> 00:16:10.378]  The PAC funds internet and TV ads, raises money for liberal candidates and causes, and finances grassroots campaigns.
[00:16:10.698 --> 00:16:19.023]  Kurt Nimmo pointed out back in January that MoveOn.org members voted by 78.6% to support Bernie Sanders.
[00:16:19.283 --> 00:16:22.926]  A massive swath of those supporters are the millennial generation.
[00:16:23.206 --> 00:16:23.647]  I don't know.
[00:16:43.109 --> 00:16:45.231]  With their bloated ignorance of the facts.
[00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:54.580]  Paul Joseph Watson writes, A pro-Bernie Sanders Craigslist ad invites people in Wisconsin to protest against Donald Trump for $15 an hour.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:01.166]  Beneath an image of the Bernie Sanders t-shirt, the ad reads, Paid positions for protesters at the Trump rally.
[00:17:01.406 --> 00:17:05.790]  Shuttle buses, parking, signs, and hourly pay available.
[00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.373]  $15 an hour due to economic inequality.
[00:17:08.533 --> 00:17:16.236]  Meet at 3300 West Trip Road, Janesville, Wisconsin for pre-protest instructions and to get your time card.
[00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:30.602]  According to Gazette Extra, these very protesters ignorantly held an anti-Trump rally on the private property of the Janesville Holiday Inn, utilizing professional tactics, including handcuffing themselves to the PVC pipes
[00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:35.826]  And having their own medic on the scene, according to Janesville Police Sergeant Mike Blazer.
[00:17:36.126 --> 00:17:38.508]  Six of those protesters were arrested.
[00:17:38.648 --> 00:17:48.116]  Doing a simple search of Donald Trump's next stop in Wausau, Wisconsin, Craigslist revealed yet another MoveOn.org paid protest ad.
[00:17:48.296 --> 00:17:54.121]  Underneath the image of a unicorn in front of a rainbow, the ad reads, looking for like-minded people.
[00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:56.383]  To protest upcoming Trump rally.
[00:17:56.523 --> 00:18:00.126]  Last time Trump radicals tried to infiltrate our group.
[00:18:00.386 --> 00:18:04.029]  So this time we will have to have a system to screen people.
[00:18:04.229 --> 00:18:09.434]  You will have to prove to a screener that you feel the burn or you're ready for Hillary.
[00:18:09.634 --> 00:18:12.537]  We don't care what candidate for the Democrats you support.
[00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:14.418]  We just have to dump Trump.
[00:18:14.738 --> 00:18:18.842]  We will have a screener at a local bookstore to direct you to our location.
[00:18:19.122 --> 00:18:22.243]  Think MoveOn for all we are able to do.
[00:18:22.443 --> 00:18:29.666]  They are helping and will give us the means to offer pay for up to an hour original two hours of protesting with us.
[00:18:30.006 --> 00:18:30.786]  Whatever that means.
[00:18:31.206 --> 00:18:41.030]  Compensation is described as to be announced because of the right-wing radicals who publicize us trying to compete with income inequality.
[00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.871]  So it is from Saul Linsky's MoveOn.org textbook
[00:18:45.071 --> 00:18:48.934]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very, very carefully.
[00:19:06.533 --> 00:19:14.485]  Because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many, many people around me.
[00:19:15.026 --> 00:19:21.455]  I was a big sports enthusiast, but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old up to about 22 or so.
[00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:28.102]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:34.408]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work, I stopped working out.
[00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:39.193]  And everything was okay for four or five years, but then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:43.096]  And in the next 10 years, I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:56.459]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances, and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight, and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.040]  I even changed my diet.
[00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.742]  I even increased the exercise.
[00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:00.303]  It didn't work.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:06.190]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed
[00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.177]  My whole life changed.
[00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:14.844]  I've gone from 200 and almost 80 pounds down to about 220 pounds or so.
[00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:16.446]  It is incredible.
[00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:24.635]  And in just the last three years, Super Male Vitality, developed by Dr. Grube for mfulworthslife.com exclusively,
[00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:32.462]  And products like the Survival Shield X2 Nascent Ionine have just done incredible things for my body.
[00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:40.090]  I work out less, even though I'm older, I've lost more weight, my muscles got stronger, my stamina, my libido, and so much more.
[00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:46.455]  The truth is, we went out to bring you the very best we could, true game-changing products.

[00:21:34.645 --> 00:21:35.546]  But where do you get it?
[00:21:35.846 --> 00:21:41.611]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:21:41.832 --> 00:21:47.557]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[00:23:15.455 --> 00:23:17.416]  We've all seen reports about government waste.
[00:23:17.476 --> 00:23:19.518]  It's kind of like that scene in Independence Day.
[00:23:19.758 --> 00:23:22.920]  The guy says, what do you think, they spend $100 on a hammer?
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.180]  $500 on a toilet seat?
[00:23:24.501 --> 00:23:26.162]  Well, actually, they kind of do do that.
[00:23:26.242 --> 00:23:29.244]  We've seen the reports from Senator Tom Coburn from Oklahoma.
[00:23:29.704 --> 00:23:37.969]  But one report I want to focus on here today is about the DEA plane that cost $86 million to combat drug trafficking in Afghanistan.
[00:23:38.209 --> 00:23:42.732]  Now, before we talk about everything that's just wrong with that statement in general, we'll focus on the plane.
[00:23:43.092 --> 00:23:46.277]  This is a 86 million dollar plane that has not even left the ground.
[00:23:46.337 --> 00:23:50.522]  It's my understanding it's not even in the bunker that they built for it over in Afghanistan.
[00:23:50.883 --> 00:23:55.269]  Now the original cost for the plane was 22 million dollars and that ballooned quite a bit.
[00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.595]  The numbers for the plane, the mathematics included, but are definitely not limited to
[00:24:00.836 --> 00:24:07.137]  $8.5 million for parts and also, I guess it includes $5 million in spare engines for the plane.
[00:24:07.638 --> 00:24:12.319]  Also, lavish trips to various countries to conduct research as well as many other things.
[00:24:12.899 --> 00:24:24.821]  And when you talk about Afghanistan in the drug trade, you can't overlook the fact that the opium has boomed since American US military intervention in Afghanistan.
[00:24:24.901 --> 00:24:25.861]  It is not my opinion.
[00:24:25.941 --> 00:24:27.142]  It is not a conspiracy theory.
[00:24:27.262 --> 00:24:28.762]  It is a documented fact.
[00:24:29.912 --> 00:24:39.520]  This contradiction, the fact that here you have one of the best fighting forces in the world ever mounted, and in a sense, you're watching as this opium is being grown.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.381]  I know it grinds at your gut.
[00:24:42.082 --> 00:24:43.003]  How do you deal with it?
[00:24:43.143 --> 00:24:44.504]  What are you doing about it?
[00:24:44.584 --> 00:24:46.185]  Well, frankly, this is a part of their culture.
[00:24:46.566 --> 00:24:50.789]  So, while it might grind in my gut, it's what they do.
[00:24:50.849 --> 00:24:54.933]  We provide them security, we're providing them resources, and we're providing them alternatives.
[00:24:54.973 --> 00:24:57.455]  And the alternatives are different crops to grow.
[00:24:58.649 --> 00:24:59.550]  And that's just opium.
[00:25:15.911 --> 00:25:17.372]  CIA cocaine.
[00:25:17.392 --> 00:25:33.044]  One of the first clips that pops up is likely going to be a town hall meeting where a LAPD detective was talking to the CIA director, I believe at that time it was Deutch, and he says, I can tell you, Mr. CIA director, as a officer in this neighborhood, your agency has dealt drugs here for quite some time.
[00:25:34.365 --> 00:25:43.632]  I am a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective and I work South Central Los Angeles and I will tell you, Director Deutch, the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:47.570]  And we'll end with this.
[00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:48.870]  This is the big enchilada.
[00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.652]  This is probably one of my favorite newscasts of all time.
[00:25:52.273 --> 00:25:54.034]  This is CBS's 60 Minutes.
[00:25:54.574 --> 00:25:57.256]  Mike Wallace is talking to the head of the DEA.
[00:25:57.496 --> 00:25:59.698]  He says, hold on, Mr. DEA head.
[00:25:59.998 --> 00:26:02.900]  You're telling me that the CIA brought cocaine into this country?
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.201]  And the DEA head says, yes, Mike.
[00:26:05.281 --> 00:26:06.522]  I don't know any other way to put it.
[00:26:06.842 --> 00:26:09.024]  Any rational person can see that this is going on.
[00:26:10.316 --> 00:26:11.237]  Let me put it this way, Mike.
[00:26:11.837 --> 00:26:18.601]  If this has not been approved by DEA or an appropriate law enforcement authority in the United States, then it's illegal.
[00:26:18.781 --> 00:26:20.002]  It's called drug trafficking.
[00:26:20.022 --> 00:26:21.043]  It's called drug smuggling.
[00:26:21.323 --> 00:26:23.764]  So what you're saying, in effect, is the CIA broke the law.
[00:26:24.505 --> 00:26:25.025]  Simple as that.
[00:26:26.246 --> 00:26:29.168]  I don't think there's any other way you can rationalize around it.
[00:26:30.288 --> 00:26:39.094]  Assuming, as I think we can, that there was some knowledge on the part of CIA, at least some participation in approving or condoning this to be done.
[00:26:39.983 --> 00:26:40.705]  So there you have it.
[00:26:40.785 --> 00:26:47.698]  Whether they're bringing in the drugs or combating drug trafficking, there's no amount of money that is too large to spend from the American taxpayer.
[00:26:48.119 --> 00:26:51.525]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:26:57.853 --> 00:27:00.534]  And now, more than ever, this cover-up has to come out to expose us.
[00:27:00.574 --> 00:27:06.635]  And the good news is, Donald Trump, the last few months, has been saying, hey, there's secret pages that need to be brought out.
[00:27:07.115 --> 00:27:09.416]  He's been talking about having a press conference with the families.
[00:27:10.056 --> 00:27:11.417]  That's very exciting.
[00:27:11.457 --> 00:27:17.618]  So it shows the attention that Walter Jones and you, the listeners, and others brought to this is bearing fruit.
[00:27:18.038 --> 00:27:19.299]  So this isn't a pep rally.
[00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:23.920]  I'm giving you a little three-minute synopsis of where we're at to let folks know that
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:30.262]  The few good men and women we've got in Congress taking action with millions of other people like you out there is having an effect.
[00:27:30.302 --> 00:27:38.665]  So I want to get orders from our general on this, Congressman Jones, to find out the latest, where we're going and what we can do to push this over the edge.
[00:27:39.045 --> 00:27:41.046]  Representative Walter Jones, thank you so much, sir.
[00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:43.027]  Well, Alex, thank you.
[00:27:43.107 --> 00:27:51.430]  And it's people like you who have access through your show to so many people that are energizing the support that we need.
[00:27:52.239 --> 00:27:55.461]  To get a declassification of the 28 pages.
[00:27:55.801 --> 00:28:09.349]  And let me say that Bob Graham, he's the former Senator from Florida, he was a co-chair at the time that they wrote the 9-11 Congressional Inquiry into the attack on New York and other states.
[00:28:10.169 --> 00:28:13.111]  And quite frankly, it was the Bush administration.
[00:28:13.331 --> 00:28:14.192]  I want to make that clear.
[00:28:14.232 --> 00:28:20.736]  I know you're in Texas, but the Bush administration are the ones that classified the 28 pages.
[00:28:22.378 --> 00:28:29.842]  The inquiry released a whole report, but it had to go to the administration at that time, the Bush administration.
[00:28:30.522 --> 00:28:38.807]  Then they had to review the report before it was made public, and they decided, the Bush administration, that the 28 pages should be classified.
[00:28:39.847 --> 00:28:49.092]  I have read the report, other members, the 28 pages, excuse me, and other members have, and that's why we have almost 40 members of the House from both parties,
[00:28:49.966 --> 00:28:55.491]  Who have joined Steve Lynch from Massachusetts.
[00:28:55.511 --> 00:28:56.651]  He's a Democrat.
[00:28:57.072 --> 00:28:59.254]  Thomas Massey from Kentucky, Republican.
[00:28:59.354 --> 00:29:09.642]  And myself have put in a resolution for two sessions of Congress now, calling on the White House to keep its word to the 9-11 families.
[00:29:09.722 --> 00:29:16.908]  And Obama gave his word to the families that he would declassify, or excuse me, consider declassifying the information.
[00:29:17.648 --> 00:29:22.992]  But thanks to you and many other hosts like yourself throughout this country, the word is out.
[00:29:24.253 --> 00:29:27.275]  And your preface to me getting on was exactly right.
[00:29:28.056 --> 00:29:35.821]  The Saudis are just as complicit as the Iranians in half the problems we have around this world with jihadists.
[00:29:36.021 --> 00:29:38.383]  And you're exactly right in what you said.
[00:29:38.403 --> 00:29:41.906]  I will tell you that I'm very hopeful that
[00:29:42.833 --> 00:30:04.535]  Senator Graham, myself, and Steve Lynch are going to meet with the CIA Director Clapper in early May and ask him to please do what is necessary to educate the American people and keep the amendment, excuse me, keep the word to the 9-11 families who have been so hurt since 9-11.
[00:30:06.357 --> 00:30:14.081]  Well, speaking of Saudi Arabia, I see on the news where they're involved with Hollywood, the Stock Exchange, they're trying to buy the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
[00:30:14.701 --> 00:30:16.302]  They are heavily influencing media.
[00:30:16.462 --> 00:30:18.363]  I know they censored Michael Savage's book.
[00:30:19.263 --> 00:30:21.624]  I have had to actually deal with pressure they've put on us.
[00:30:22.324 --> 00:30:29.948]  This is an out-of-control government that is meddling in our affairs, I think more than any other foreign government, but no one ever talks about it.
[00:30:30.288 --> 00:30:31.689]  I mean, I get critical of Israel.
[00:30:32.469 --> 00:30:33.429]  Being involved internally.
[00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.450]  I'm not an enemy of Israel.
[00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.270]  I'm a friend of Israel.
[00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.431]  But I don't like Israel meddling in our internal affairs.
[00:30:38.172 --> 00:30:40.673]  But no one ever talks about Saudi Arabia.
[00:30:40.853 --> 00:30:43.094]  I think it's the number one meddler, maybe after China.
[00:30:44.835 --> 00:30:46.715]  Well, Alex, I agree with you.
[00:30:46.795 --> 00:30:59.041]  I think you have stated, and many others have stated, and we have read public information that talks about how Saudi Arabia... Look at what's happening with the jihadists and the ISA.
[00:30:59.781 --> 00:31:01.181]  Where are the Saudi troops?
[00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:02.381]  They're not on the ground.
[00:31:03.002 --> 00:31:06.422]  But everybody in the Middle East wants America to put its troops on the ground.
[00:31:07.142 --> 00:31:08.262]  It doesn't make any sense.
[00:31:08.302 --> 00:31:10.023]  They won't even take one refugee, sir!
[00:31:11.263 --> 00:31:12.083]  Well, that's the point.
[00:31:12.323 --> 00:31:28.346]  I mean, you know, Steve, King and I were the only two Republicans back in November when the Republican Party wanted to show the American people that we were concerned about all these immigrants coming over from Syria and these other countries.
[00:31:29.145 --> 00:31:42.783]  Uh, and we knew when Steve King and I did not vote for the House resolution that was put in by the Republican Party that says we're going to tell this administration, the Obama administration,
[00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:50.734]  You've got to do a better job of vetting these people, these 10,000 people coming into America that we agreed to take in.
[00:31:51.275 --> 00:31:53.276]  And I knew that was a shell game.
[00:31:53.777 --> 00:31:57.540]  Steve King knew it was a shell game, and we voted against it.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:10.110]  Because what happened, Alex, was in December of this year, 2015, when we passed the budget of $1.1 trillion, the money was in there for Mr. Obama to bring in the 10,000 refugees.
[00:32:13.194 --> 00:32:13.674]  Amazing.
[00:32:13.734 --> 00:32:18.416]  And the numbers I get from people inside ICE is that it's way above what we're even being told.
[00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:21.637]  30-plus governors have asked who they are, what their names are.
[00:32:22.037 --> 00:32:22.958]  They're just being brought in.
[00:32:23.038 --> 00:32:27.759]  I'm told they're being given new names and Social Security numbers and Section 8 housing.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:44.689]  I know you don't like to speculate, but looking at Europe being flooded, Merkel inviting in millions of people from war zones, mostly military-age men, not vetting them, Interpol telling them that they're full of jihadis, ISIS saying, we're coming to attack you.
[00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:06.941]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:33:07.322 --> 00:33:14.446]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:33:15.047 --> 00:33:23.412]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:33:23.672 --> 00:33:27.775]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:33:28.095 --> 00:33:33.439]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:33:33.439 --> 00:33:34.500]  We're good to go.

[00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:07.152]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:07.413 --> 00:35:21.859]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:22.819]  We're good to go.
[00:35:43.365 --> 00:35:51.211]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:51.371 --> 00:35:56.796]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a 6-day liver detox.
[00:35:56.816 --> 00:36:00.338]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:00.518 --> 00:36:04.522]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:08.545]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:08.865 --> 00:36:09.045]  I'm good.
[00:37:04.876 --> 00:37:05.837]  Look at Hillary.
[00:37:06.217 --> 00:37:07.638]  She needs to be in prison.
[00:37:07.698 --> 00:37:09.199]  Look at people are voting for her.
[00:37:09.219 --> 00:37:11.440]  They don't even know what the hell they're voting for.
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.462]  I don't like when you're walking around with signs that say, love everybody, love everybody.
[00:37:15.482 --> 00:37:17.683]  And it's like, why should everybody be loved?
[00:37:17.743 --> 00:37:19.064]  We're not walking around with signs.
[00:37:19.164 --> 00:37:20.264]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:37:20.444 --> 00:37:22.585]  Do you know what Rico is?
[00:37:22.605 --> 00:37:23.785]  Do you know what Rico is?
[00:37:23.805 --> 00:37:24.766]  Do you know what Hillary did?
[00:37:24.786 --> 00:37:26.026]  Do you know what Obama did?
[00:37:26.146 --> 00:37:27.006]  Are you Democrats?
[00:37:27.066 --> 00:37:28.167]  Are you kidding me?
[00:37:28.327 --> 00:37:32.328]  Do you read the history of America?
[00:37:32.488 --> 00:37:36.009]  Of course I do, that's why I'm here in the Trump line today.
[00:37:36.029 --> 00:37:37.010]  Do you know that?
[00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:40.171]  Alright, hey, how's it going, buddy?
[00:37:40.331 --> 00:37:42.611]  I thought you might like to hear a child's perspective.
[00:37:42.631 --> 00:37:43.792]  Alright, hey, what's your name?
[00:37:44.132 --> 00:37:44.812]  Jack Turner.
[00:37:44.972 --> 00:37:46.172]  Jack Turner, where are you from?
[00:37:46.633 --> 00:37:47.413]  I'm from Illinois.
[00:37:47.993 --> 00:37:52.034]  And what made you come drive all the way up here into Appleton, Wisconsin?
[00:37:52.235 --> 00:37:53.515]  Because we love Trump.
[00:37:53.775 --> 00:37:54.755]  Yeah?
[00:37:54.775 --> 00:37:55.516]  So why do you love Trump?
[00:37:56.056 --> 00:38:05.139]  Because, well, we love that he's taking education out of the federal government and putting it to the local government.
[00:38:05.439 --> 00:38:06.219]  Are you homeschooled?
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:06.960]  No.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.600]  So you go to public school.
[00:38:09.601 --> 00:38:14.302]  And what do you think of the math that they teach you there where they say, which answer is reasonable?
[00:38:15.643 --> 00:38:16.263]  I don't like it.
[00:38:17.813 --> 00:38:19.415]  Yeah, when you don't teach people.
[00:38:20.717 --> 00:38:21.678]  He knows what it's called.
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.222]  Common Core.
[00:38:24.242 --> 00:38:25.664]  And what else do you like about Trump's policies?
[00:38:26.664 --> 00:38:39.329]  I love that he's bringing good trade back into our country and is not going to let all these different countries take over our trade.
[00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:40.169]  There you go.
[00:38:40.289 --> 00:38:41.109]  Wow, smart kid.
[00:38:41.469 --> 00:38:42.770]  So do you guys listen to Infowars a lot?
[00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.890]  We do.
[00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:45.211]  Well, I do.
[00:38:45.511 --> 00:38:50.513]  I'm first and foremost where he got introduced to it, but he's kind of taken a lot of it on his own.
[00:38:51.113 --> 00:38:54.134]  He knows what there is to know about GMO, about fluoride.
[00:38:54.834 --> 00:39:01.645]  He's very well versed in those things and he actually educates himself so he knows why he shouldn't ingest those things.
[00:39:01.665 --> 00:39:05.991]  One of the only kids you'll ever meet that somebody says, hey, let's go to McDonald's.
[00:39:06.031 --> 00:39:07.273]  He says, no, no, thank you.
[00:39:07.453 --> 00:39:08.374]  That's how my kids are.
[00:39:08.775 --> 00:39:09.877]  When they go, they don't get anything.
[00:39:10.177 --> 00:39:11.018]  You say you know a lot.
[00:39:11.098 --> 00:39:11.418]  Tell me.
[00:39:11.578 --> 00:39:15.962]  You got a group of people on the regressive left here who they want to stifle free speech.
[00:39:16.342 --> 00:39:17.623]  Trump's somebody who's not afraid.
[00:39:17.643 --> 00:39:22.167]  He's not going to be pushed into a box by the media where he has to say exactly what they want him to say.
[00:39:22.467 --> 00:39:35.577]  I think this is less about Trump and more about freedom of speech, freedom for Americans to choose their own voter, to not be told by the Republican Party elites that they have to vote for somebody based on they're in the good old boys club of the Republican Party, is what I would say.
[00:39:36.258 --> 00:39:37.419]  So why do you hate Trump?
[00:39:38.059 --> 00:39:41.660]  Uh, because he is sexist and what he stands for is wrong.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.420]  I mean, we need immigrants.
[00:39:44.681 --> 00:39:46.481]  We all were immigrants at once.
[00:39:46.641 --> 00:39:49.122]  I mean... I don't think he's saying we don't need immigrants.
[00:39:49.142 --> 00:39:50.962]  I think he's saying we don't need illegal immigration.
[00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:53.643]  Well, I can understand that.
[00:39:53.683 --> 00:39:58.104]  I mean, going through the proper channels would be the right way, but we don't need to build a wall.
[00:39:58.124 --> 00:40:00.745]  I mean... What would a wall do?
[00:40:01.765 --> 00:40:03.245]  Um, be ridiculous.
[00:40:04.306 --> 00:40:05.026]  And expensive.
[00:40:06.218 --> 00:40:07.801]  Did you see the country of Macedonia?
[00:40:07.821 --> 00:40:10.527]  They're having so many immigrants come in.
[00:40:10.707 --> 00:40:12.090]  Migrants, they're saying, through Turkey.
[00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:14.294]  They had to actually build a wall on their border.
[00:40:15.136 --> 00:40:15.516]  Okay.
[00:40:16.438 --> 00:40:17.721]  Is that racist that they did that?
[00:40:19.733 --> 00:40:20.694]  I don't know.
[00:40:20.714 --> 00:40:27.338]  He's trying to build a wall to block out Mexicans.
[00:40:27.438 --> 00:40:28.438]  Why is that?
[00:40:28.479 --> 00:40:28.779]  No, no, no.
[00:40:28.799 --> 00:40:31.140]  He's not trying to build a wall to block out Mexicans.
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:35.303]  He's trying to build a wall to secure the border.
[00:40:35.723 --> 00:40:36.684]  You guys don't get it.
[00:40:36.904 --> 00:40:38.125]  We need a secure border.
[00:40:40.486 --> 00:40:42.707]  We're going down the hole.
[00:40:42.747 --> 00:40:45.128]  You can't let everybody in.
[00:40:45.568 --> 00:40:47.689]  Let the country take care of their people.
[00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:49.790]  We can't take care of everybody.
[00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.551]  We're going down the hole for it.
[00:40:51.711 --> 00:40:55.232]  You gotta know who to let, who to help, and who not to.
[00:40:55.312 --> 00:40:56.173]  Not the whole world.
[00:40:56.213 --> 00:40:57.633]  We can't.
[00:40:57.693 --> 00:40:59.414]  We have to strengthen our country.
[00:40:59.534 --> 00:41:01.155]  We have to strengthen our military.
[00:41:01.175 --> 00:41:03.376]  Vote Trump, get dumped!
[00:41:03.396 --> 00:41:05.677]  Make America drunk again!
[00:41:11.395 --> 00:41:14.439]  Hey, you're right on.
[00:41:16.101 --> 00:41:19.484]  If people would really know what it's about.
[00:41:19.604 --> 00:41:22.167]  They don't study to know what it's all about.
[00:41:22.307 --> 00:41:23.309]  They've got their sound bites.
[00:41:24.062 --> 00:41:27.604]  They just do what they want to do because they think they're right.
[00:41:27.764 --> 00:41:28.585]  And they're not right.
[00:41:28.705 --> 00:41:31.727]  They have to learn about what's going on here.
[00:41:32.367 --> 00:41:33.108]  Think about it.
[00:41:33.668 --> 00:41:34.469]  Listen to this.
[00:41:34.529 --> 00:41:35.790]  Let them pay for it.
[00:41:37.391 --> 00:41:38.051]  They don't have jobs.
[00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:39.132]  That's right.
[00:41:39.152 --> 00:41:41.914]  It just gets me... They'll change their tune fairly quickly.
[00:41:43.114 --> 00:41:45.396]  You know, I was a liberal too when I wasn't paying taxes.
[00:41:46.276 --> 00:41:46.676]  Uh-oh.
[00:41:47.257 --> 00:41:47.677]  See?
[00:41:48.017 --> 00:41:48.417]  See?
[00:41:49.098 --> 00:41:54.521]  The head of his political campaign, or his head spokesman, is a black African-American woman?
[00:41:54.541 --> 00:41:55.001]  Do you know that?
[00:41:55.861 --> 00:41:58.903]  Uh, no, but that doesn't change how he talks to women.
[00:41:58.923 --> 00:42:01.224]  I mean, he's degrading.
[00:42:02.084 --> 00:42:06.527]  So... If you, like, backtalk him, he blames it on your period.
[00:42:08.288 --> 00:42:08.968]  That's ridiculous.
[00:42:10.229 --> 00:42:12.650]  So... I don't know.
[00:42:13.345 --> 00:42:18.930]  I totally agree, and it looks like right now that they're trying to steal it for Clinton and for Ted Cruz or Kasich.
[00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:21.993]  I don't know, but they definitely do not want Trump in the Republican nomination.
[00:42:22.013 --> 00:42:30.261]  You see in Janesville yesterday, when Trump talks out against Scott Walker, you actually have Republicans in the state of Wisconsin booing Scott Walker, their governor.
[00:42:30.521 --> 00:42:31.101]  And Paul Ryan.
[00:42:31.242 --> 00:42:34.324]  Which to me shows that they're losing touch with their base.
[00:42:34.444 --> 00:42:38.086]  What they should have done is, when they saw this movement, they should have rallied around Trump immediately.
[00:42:38.206 --> 00:42:39.087]  They shouldn't have waited for this.
[00:42:39.107 --> 00:42:42.989]  Because in a political movement, you can't create a movement out of whole cloth.
[00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:45.391]  You need to take an existing movement and push it.
[00:42:45.651 --> 00:42:46.291]  They're not doing that.
[00:42:46.311 --> 00:42:47.272]  They're trying to stop it.
[00:42:47.572 --> 00:42:49.133]  And you can't stop a real movement.
[00:42:49.173 --> 00:42:52.235]  They're going to end up tearing their party apart, and they're going to blame Trump for it.
[00:42:52.515 --> 00:42:59.780]  So anyway, you were telling me about the Bernie protest yesterday, and the Bernie rally yesterday, and then this is a very liberal town, so tell me about that little story.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:13.633]  Well, you know, Bernie had his rally over there at the university yesterday, and they were all out for that, and they were all talking about how they were going to protest this today, and that's pretty weak down there for a liberal town.
[00:43:15.882 --> 00:43:21.703]  You know, I question whose side the hate is actually on, because they're sounding pretty hateful down there.
[00:43:22.183 --> 00:43:24.243]  You know, with all their love signs and stuff like that.
[00:43:24.303 --> 00:43:25.224]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:43:25.264 --> 00:43:30.685]  They say, we can put love and hate in the same sign and it's okay, but you can't say anything or it's hateful.
[00:43:30.965 --> 00:43:31.805]  Right, exactly.
[00:43:34.285 --> 00:43:37.066]  You know, what I realize is you just can't understand the liberal mind.
[00:43:37.546 --> 00:43:40.806]  You know, it's not something that is understandable.
[00:43:41.186 --> 00:43:44.067]  They're just, they're body surfing on the rings of Saturn.
[00:43:45.342 --> 00:43:47.403]  So how many people are out here today on your side?
[00:43:47.963 --> 00:43:50.184]  On my side?
[00:43:50.204 --> 00:43:50.985]  Do you come with a big group?
[00:43:52.065 --> 00:43:54.486]  These teenagers, who can't even vote yet.
[00:43:55.547 --> 00:43:56.307]  Are you a voting age?
[00:43:56.788 --> 00:43:57.568]  Yeah, I am 22.
[00:43:57.688 --> 00:44:03.771]  And I guess you're going to vote for Bernie?
[00:44:04.171 --> 00:44:04.491]  Yeah.
[00:44:05.272 --> 00:44:11.955]  Did you hear that even if he wins the nomination contest in New York, they're still going to give the delegates to Hillary Clinton?
[00:44:12.794 --> 00:44:13.835]  I was not aware of that.
[00:44:14.155 --> 00:44:15.115]  It's in New York Daily News.
[00:44:15.156 --> 00:44:16.957]  It was in the front page cover story.
[00:44:17.357 --> 00:44:18.778]  Oh, well that's interesting.
[00:44:19.818 --> 00:44:23.340]  You ought to check that out because they're definitely gearing up.
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:33.086]  They don't like anybody anti-establishment, which is why you have the Republican establishment going after Trump right now and saying, you know, they're agreeing with a lot of things that the left's saying because they don't want him in there either.
[00:44:33.426 --> 00:44:35.487]  And you have the same thing on the left with the Bernie people.
[00:44:35.527 --> 00:44:38.969]  They don't want Bernie Sanders in that office or running for the Democrat.
[00:44:38.989 --> 00:44:39.930]  They want to anoint Hillary.
[00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:45.033]  Just like this thing with this reporter, I'm not familiar with her name, who got pushed or whatever.
[00:44:45.453 --> 00:44:53.297]  I mean, Paul Joseph Watson on your channel did a video of the assassination of Donald Trump where he showed an angle where, I mean, he barely touches her.
[00:44:53.397 --> 00:44:54.218]  He barely touches her.
[00:44:54.238 --> 00:44:56.799]  This is using the criminal justice system.
[00:44:57.079 --> 00:45:03.443]  The Jupiter, Florida Police Department should be embarrassed to themselves for basically having a witch hunt against a guy where he did nothing wrong.
[00:45:03.903 --> 00:45:08.726]  They wrote in the police report that they used hands, teeth, and feet to knock her to the ground.
[00:45:09.347 --> 00:45:11.148]  You can watch even the surveillance video.
[00:45:11.168 --> 00:45:13.269]  There's nothing like that going on at that time.
[00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:14.270]  It's absurd.
[00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:19.674]  I mean, you've got everybody from the Pope to Scott Walker to everybody coming against this guy.
[00:45:19.954 --> 00:45:23.156]  The globalists are pulling out their all stops to try to stop this guy.
[00:45:23.556 --> 00:45:32.843]  Even if you don't support Donald Trump, even if you think he's a brash idiot, the fact that all of these power brokers are coming out against him means they're afraid of something and I think you've got to rally behind that.
[00:45:33.303 --> 00:45:33.863]  Totally agree.
[00:45:33.883 --> 00:45:35.565]  Do you want to see some battery really quick?
[00:45:36.045 --> 00:45:36.585]  Oh my god!
[00:45:36.645 --> 00:45:37.106]  Oh my god!
[00:45:37.166 --> 00:45:37.406]  Wait!
[00:45:37.586 --> 00:45:40.068]  He's never going to be the same again!
[00:45:40.568 --> 00:45:42.289]  Call Ben Shapiro!
[00:45:42.329 --> 00:45:42.970]  Who's the sheriff here?
[00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.350]  Call the sheriff.
[00:45:44.471 --> 00:45:45.771]  Obviously this is Trump's fault right here.
[00:45:45.811 --> 00:45:46.932]  We just saw the assault happen.
[00:45:47.613 --> 00:45:51.035]  So what attracted you to Donald Trump?
[00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:52.476]  He's for the people.
[00:45:53.196 --> 00:45:57.199]  He's not here to tax us.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.441]  He knows what he's talking about.
[00:46:00.982 --> 00:46:02.823]  What do you think of the protesters out here?
[00:46:04.186 --> 00:46:08.289]  You know, on this side there's a lot more hate going on than on the Trump side, that's for sure.
[00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:09.651]  Trump's a racist!
[00:46:09.731 --> 00:46:11.292]  So are you!
[00:46:11.312 --> 00:46:11.853]  Trump's a racist!
[00:46:11.873 --> 00:46:12.813]  So are you!
[00:46:12.954 --> 00:46:14.014]  Trump's a racist!
[00:46:14.054 --> 00:46:14.955]  So are you!
[00:46:15.115 --> 00:46:16.196]  Trump's a racist!
[00:46:16.236 --> 00:46:17.117]  So are you!
[00:46:17.277 --> 00:46:18.318]  Trump's a racist!
[00:46:18.358 --> 00:46:19.019]  So are you!
[00:46:19.039 --> 00:46:22.102]  Were there any people protesting Bernie Sanders when he was here?
[00:46:23.583 --> 00:46:24.503]  I didn't see anything.
[00:46:24.823 --> 00:46:25.704]  Hey, let me ask you something.
[00:46:25.924 --> 00:46:27.005]  Were you at the Bernie rally?
[00:46:27.385 --> 00:46:27.625]  Yeah.
[00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:30.206]  Was anybody protesting the Bernie rally like this?
[00:46:30.747 --> 00:46:30.987]  No.
[00:46:31.747 --> 00:46:32.368]  No one was there.
[00:46:33.748 --> 00:46:36.750]  So they were just letting people go into the Bernie rally without harassing them?
[00:46:37.291 --> 00:46:37.471]  Yeah.
[00:46:40.307 --> 00:46:41.588]  Hey, were you guys at the Bernie rally?
[00:46:42.428 --> 00:46:44.829]  Yes we were.
[00:46:44.989 --> 00:46:47.591]  Were there people protesting the Bernie rally?
[00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:48.471]  Very few.
[00:46:49.171 --> 00:46:49.812]  But there was some?
[00:46:50.232 --> 00:46:53.433]  I think I saw maybe two or three.
[00:46:53.493 --> 00:46:54.634]  Not as organized as you guys?
[00:46:55.114 --> 00:46:55.214]  No.
[00:47:03.004 --> 00:47:04.006]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.547 --> 00:47:06.831]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.112 --> 00:47:14.966]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:05.865 --> 00:49:16.133]  Joining me now is David Knight, and we're going to be covering several topics, things that are being used now, some subversive tactics that are being used to take down the Republic.
[00:49:16.433 --> 00:49:22.838]  And these are not things that are going to happen overnight, you know, it's not going to be night and day with this overthrow, but this is the long-term game.
[00:49:23.258 --> 00:49:28.002]  Now, we've been seeing it, people get into college and by the time they get out, they're little communists.
[00:49:28.522 --> 00:49:33.625]  And so this is just a sort of a subculture of what has been happening over decades.
[00:49:34.045 --> 00:49:38.667]  Now first, we'll talk about these publicly funded charter schools.
[00:49:38.727 --> 00:49:48.352]  Now we started doing some investigating on this topic last year, and now there's some new claims coming out, but it's not just publicly funded charter schools out there in the U.S.
[00:49:48.692 --> 00:49:52.834]  targeting children, but now they're actually being set up possibly on U.S.
[00:49:52.914 --> 00:49:53.834]  military bases.
[00:49:54.415 --> 00:49:55.075]  What could go wrong?
[00:49:55.495 --> 00:50:03.426]  Well, you know, Leanne, as you pointed out, this is something that's been going on for a long time, and this has been developing over three to four decades.
[00:50:03.486 --> 00:50:08.293]  We've had the Department of Education, where the federal government took it over, and at the time, Charlotte Isserby and Phyllis Schlafly.
[00:50:09.065 --> 00:50:12.148]  Wrote the book, Dumbing Down, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America.
[00:50:12.388 --> 00:50:29.905]  And what we see out of this now is the fruit of this are these kids, largely it's university students, who we see at these Donald Trump rallies, who basically have this bipolar world, this bifurcated world, where everybody's either LGBT or they're RXH, racist, xenophobe, homophobic.
[00:50:30.726 --> 00:50:34.633]  So that's the kind of, we have to distinguish between education and indoctrination.
[00:50:34.693 --> 00:50:40.243]  So the thing that really should be concerning to us all is the fact that we now have a Turkish Imam.
[00:50:40.894 --> 00:50:51.740]  Who is using the charter school setup that we have predominantly in Texas, but a lot of states have bought into this, but it's focused largely in Texas and that's where it has been.
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.481]  We reported on this back in December.
[00:50:54.262 --> 00:51:01.686]  They're using the charter schools to establish this network of schools that are heavily influenced by this Turkish Imam.
[00:51:02.306 --> 00:51:06.629]  Now, when we reported on this back in December, there was a lawsuit that was being filed and of course it was
[00:51:08.763 --> 00:51:12.526]  Turkish imam is actually challenging the Turkish government.
[00:51:12.566 --> 00:51:16.208]  So the Turkish government has hired a high-powered law firm to come after them.
[00:51:16.649 --> 00:51:27.216]  This article today that was carried by the Drudge Report on the Hill and written by this lawyer who is filing this lawsuit against the Vitalik Gulen movement here and the charter schools that they run.
[00:51:27.496 --> 00:51:28.737]  Listen to the way it starts out Leanne.
[00:51:28.757 --> 00:51:32.079]  He says, the secretive Islamic movement is trying to infiltrate the U.S.
[00:51:32.239 --> 00:51:32.840]  military
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:38.843]  By establishing and operating publicly funded charter schools targeted towards children of American service personnel.
[00:51:38.863 --> 00:51:45.026]  He said, that may sound like a conspiracy theory from the lunatic fringe but it's real and is happening right now.
[00:51:45.427 --> 00:51:46.107]  Here's the deal.
[00:51:47.108 --> 00:51:50.850]  He talks about that because it is so audacious.
[00:51:51.781 --> 00:51:54.284]  That it sounds like it's not true.
[00:51:54.365 --> 00:51:57.969]  Sounds like a wild imagining, a paranoid imagining of what's going on.
[00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:02.235]  The most audacious plans are the ones that are going to succeed.
[00:52:02.616 --> 00:52:04.959]  And of course it's not just the US military.
[00:52:04.999 --> 00:52:06.321]  That gets people's attention.
[00:52:06.841 --> 00:52:08.582]  When you connect it with the military.
[00:52:08.862 --> 00:52:10.042]  But it is pervasive.
[00:52:10.362 --> 00:52:12.503]  Again, going back to this article that we had.
[00:52:12.743 --> 00:52:15.804]  There's 146 schools here in America.
[00:52:16.184 --> 00:52:17.665]  There's 300 in Turkey.
[00:52:17.705 --> 00:52:21.286]  So we've got almost half the number of schools here in America that they have in Turkey.
[00:52:21.546 --> 00:52:26.588]  There's a thousand schools worldwide that are being run by the Fatala Gulen organization.
[00:52:26.848 --> 00:52:30.069]  And other countries, they are explicitly religious.
[00:52:30.629 --> 00:52:40.211]  But in the United States, so that they can get a half billion dollars, 500 million dollars a year of taxpayer money, they run them as secular schools.
[00:52:40.251 --> 00:52:43.532]  They present them as schools of science and math.
[00:52:43.592 --> 00:52:44.732]  And this is what he says about it.
[00:52:45.032 --> 00:52:49.333]  He says the organization is one of the largest recipients of H-1B visas.
[00:52:49.753 --> 00:52:58.255]  And of course they're using the H-1B visas saying, we have to bring teachers from Turkey because we can't find science and math teachers in the United States.
[00:52:58.715 --> 00:52:59.997]  Well that's clearly not true.
[00:53:00.418 --> 00:53:05.368]  The people who are coming in, and of course there's a documentary we also covered by Mark Hall called Killing Ed.
[00:53:05.668 --> 00:53:11.279]  They've talked to people who worked for these charter schools that were run by the Gulen movement.
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:17.241]  And they pointed out that many of these teachers who are coming over are not qualified to teach anything, let alone science and math.
[00:53:17.281 --> 00:53:19.322]  So that's what some of the whistleblowers have said.
[00:53:19.782 --> 00:53:22.643]  But clearly there are science and math teachers that could be found here.
[00:53:23.063 --> 00:53:29.805]  What they're doing is in a very subtle way, they are promoting Turkey and then indirectly promoting Islam.
[00:53:30.385 --> 00:53:33.848]  Now, what he goes on to say is they deny any affiliation with Fethullah Gulen.
[00:53:33.868 --> 00:53:45.238]  Their officers, directors claim they're merely inspired by Gulen's religious teachings, as if the simple creation of business entities in which Gulen himself holds no ownership interests could alter his ultimate control of the organization.
[00:53:45.258 --> 00:53:57.067]  But in reality, they say, the governing boards of the Gulen charter schools are populated disproportionately by loyal Turkish men who answer to a handful of imams who rule over defined regions across the U.S.
[00:53:57.768 --> 00:54:05.937]  And of course, in the testimony of these whistleblowers, they are accusing the Gulen movement of having kickbacks for these teachers.
[00:54:05.997 --> 00:54:13.264]  So they pay them a larger amount of salary that they pay the domestic teachers, and then they have them kick that back to the organization.
[00:54:13.765 --> 00:54:15.286]  So this is the issue.
[00:54:16.047 --> 00:54:20.831]  And this is what we have to be very careful about, about our schools in every aspect.
[00:54:20.871 --> 00:54:23.653]  We see that socialism is being taught in our schools.
[00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:26.755]  We have all these kids coming out talking about white privilege.
[00:54:26.776 --> 00:54:29.638]  That's the only thing that they seem to be learning at this point.
[00:54:30.138 --> 00:54:34.562]  And so you have to really question, now we're going to have an Islamic influence in this.
[00:54:34.622 --> 00:54:35.682]  And people need to understand.
[00:54:36.483 --> 00:54:38.404]  Islam is not simply a religion.
[00:54:39.044 --> 00:54:51.228]  It is a religion combined with politics and that's why it's really surprising that the people on the left who are so careful about the separation of church and state embrace Islam as if there's nothing else there.
[00:54:51.668 --> 00:54:54.408]  But that's just one way that our country is being destroyed.
[00:54:54.449 --> 00:55:02.191]  I want to spend the rest of this time that we've got talking about the corruption that we see in elections because we just had a story yesterday I think is very telling
[00:55:02.931 --> 00:55:05.094]  It took the top of the Drudge Report last night.
[00:55:05.134 --> 00:55:06.997]  Bernie Sanders may be off the D.C.
[00:55:07.057 --> 00:55:11.602]  ballot after the Democratic Party didn't file their paperwork on time.
[00:55:12.143 --> 00:55:13.865]  Now they have now bent the rules.
[00:55:13.885 --> 00:55:15.267]  They're going to put him on the ballot.
[00:55:15.307 --> 00:55:18.611]  But this is very instructive because we already heard earlier this week
[00:55:19.272 --> 00:55:26.135]  That Hillary Clinton's email scandal, this was a political consultant, said, you know, there should be a higher bar for people who are running for presidential office.
[00:55:26.175 --> 00:55:28.557]  Well, it's not people who are running for presidential office.
[00:55:28.957 --> 00:55:30.658]  It's people who are Democrats and Republicans.
[00:55:30.918 --> 00:55:32.118]  They have a different set of rules.
[00:55:32.178 --> 00:55:35.800]  As a matter of fact, the rules don't apply to our rulers.
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.761]  And we need to understand who the true rulers are.
[00:55:37.781 --> 00:55:41.103]  Now, in this particular case, the Sanders campaign, as they reported,
[00:55:42.023 --> 00:55:51.032]  As well as Hillary Clinton's campaign, each submitted their registration fees and paperwork on time, earlier this month, to the Democrat Board of Elections.
[00:55:51.172 --> 00:55:52.393]  Okay, the Democrat Party rather.
[00:55:52.834 --> 00:55:57.698]  The Democrat Party did not turn in the paperwork until after the deadline.
[00:55:58.519 --> 00:56:05.124]  Subsequent to that, one voter filed a challenge against the Sanders campaign, but not against the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[00:56:05.484 --> 00:56:13.951]  So the story as it first broke was, there's going to be a challenge because Sanders' paperwork didn't get in on time, and yet Hillary's paperwork didn't get in on time either.
[00:56:14.591 --> 00:56:18.892]  But the interesting thing is, is that neither one of them met the deadline.
[00:56:19.032 --> 00:56:19.172]  Right.
[00:56:19.252 --> 00:56:19.593]  Okay?
[00:56:19.913 --> 00:56:21.713]  But they're just going to waive those requirements.
[00:56:21.753 --> 00:56:25.074]  And we've seen this in Pennsylvania as well with John Kasich.
[00:56:25.094 --> 00:56:27.555]  And I've seen it multiple times working on a third party.
[00:56:27.575 --> 00:56:35.298]  They never waive the ballot requirements for third party or independent candidates, but they will continually waive it for the Democrats and Republicans.
[00:56:35.318 --> 00:56:39.359]  We've had situations where they didn't file the paperwork, didn't do it on time, didn't do it the right way.
[00:56:39.699 --> 00:56:41.059]  They waived those requirements.
[00:56:41.139 --> 00:56:42.740]  They're doing the same thing in Pennsylvania.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.842]  Which is absolutely critical to the Kasich campaign.
[00:56:46.363 --> 00:56:48.725]  They had a 2,000 signature threshold level.
[00:56:49.185 --> 00:56:52.468]  The Kasich campaign admitted the day before Super Tuesday.
[00:56:52.508 --> 00:56:53.189]  This was in play.
[00:56:53.229 --> 00:56:54.530]  They said, no, we didn't make it.
[00:56:54.991 --> 00:56:58.474]  But we're 100% sure that the governor's name will be on the ballot.
[00:56:58.554 --> 00:56:58.854]  Why?
[00:56:59.474 --> 00:57:00.876]  Because he's politically connected.
[00:57:01.456 --> 00:57:03.798]  Now they had someone who was with the Rubio campaign.
[00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:12.493]  College Students for Rubio issued a challenge, but then withdrew it because the next day after Super Tuesday, Marco Rubio withdrew from the campaign.
[00:57:12.513 --> 00:57:18.295]  So he withdrew the challenge, but they first came back and said, well, he didn't file the challenge on time.
[00:57:18.315 --> 00:57:20.975]  So there was no deadline to file, evidently.
[00:57:21.716 --> 00:57:23.876]  The numerical requirements didn't really matter.
[00:57:24.337 --> 00:57:30.959]  So they waived all of those issues, but they said, no, the objection deadline was not met.
[00:57:31.579 --> 00:57:31.759]  Yeah.
[00:57:31.879 --> 00:57:36.402]  Now, it still stands that he has not turned in the sufficient number of signatures.
[00:57:36.442 --> 00:57:39.184]  The deadline for that has passed, but they're still going to let him stay on there.
[00:57:39.525 --> 00:57:40.745]  And that's just one example.
[00:57:40.805 --> 00:57:51.153]  I did a report also when I was on the road talking about how the ghost of George Soros and Hugo Chavez haunted the Utah caucus there because they paid $80,000 to GOP.
[00:57:53.334 --> 00:58:09.504]  Utah GOP paid $80,000 to have a company, Smartmatic, that has a lot of connections to George Soros, that was created in Venezuela, that has been accused of election fraud in Venezuela, in Mexico, in Brazil, and of course we have this news story about how the Brazilian president is close to impeachment.
[00:58:10.004 --> 00:58:16.488]  Two years ago, she was behind in the polls, 10 points behind in the polls, and then all of a sudden, she wins.
[00:58:16.568 --> 00:58:20.251]  And there's no exit polls, and the elections were run by this company, Smartmatic.
[00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:25.056]  Everybody at the time said that it was a stolen election, but they let it go anyway.
[00:58:25.456 --> 00:58:34.507]  And now the Republicans who said that Hugo Chavez used this Venezuelan company of his friends to rig the elections, they chose them to run the Utah elections.
[00:58:34.547 --> 00:58:35.548]  The same Republican Party.
[00:58:35.748 --> 00:58:43.233]  Yeah, it's definitely a tangled web that's being woven here, and people need to wake up to this and realize that this is happening.
[00:58:43.654 --> 00:58:47.396]  It's just a slow takedown of our country, and people do need to be aware.
[00:58:47.516 --> 00:58:48.477]  David, thank you so much.
