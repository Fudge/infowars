[00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:22.137]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.177 --> 00:00:26.000]  It is Friday, December 9th, 2016 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.160]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.431]  Barack Obama wants U.S.
[00:00:33.952 --> 00:00:41.481]  soldiers to question Donald Trump's authority, and he tells them it's okay to criticize the new president.
[00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:48.569]  Meanwhile, an Orange Coast college teacher calls the election of Donald Trump an act of terrorism.
[00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.912]  Then, she's back!
[00:00:51.212 --> 00:00:55.615]  Hillary Clinton is now lecturing Americans about fake news.
[00:00:55.995 --> 00:01:02.058]  And she says the federal government and Silicon Valley are in the process of eliminating it.
[00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.121]  And look who just called Tucker Carlson a Russian agent.
[00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:08.122]  You're carrying water for the Kremlin.
[00:01:08.142 --> 00:01:10.463]  I'm not carrying water for the Kremlin.
[00:01:10.483 --> 00:01:14.045]  You're a sitting member of Congress on the Insult Committee and you can't say they hacked.
[00:01:14.906 --> 00:01:18.891]  You're going to have to move your show to RT, Russian television, because... You know what?
[00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:20.653]  That's just so unique.
[00:01:20.673 --> 00:01:21.214]  You're awesome.
[00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:24.077]  That's coming up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.612 --> 00:03:08.695]  For years, InfoWars has been reporting on the fact that the U.S.
[00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:09.796]  government is using U.S.
[00:03:10.396 --> 00:03:15.240]  tax dollars to support terrorist organizations abroad covertly.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.444]  Of course, you know, for quite some time this was called a fake news, a conspiracy theory.
[00:03:20.785 --> 00:03:24.668]  But of course, now it's widely reported that this is indeed fact.
[00:03:25.148 --> 00:03:31.454]  And now, American lawmakers have actually introduced a so-called Stop Arming Terrorists Act.
[00:03:31.994 --> 00:03:34.356]  And this is a bill that's going to protect U.S.
[00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:42.101]  taxpayer dollars from being used to support and arm international terrorist groups through covert operations and third states.
[00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:47.044]  Now, it was introduced to the House Thursday by Democrat Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii.
[00:03:47.304 --> 00:03:50.387]  The legislature aims to make it illegal for any U.S.
[00:03:50.407 --> 00:04:00.734]  government agency to assist extremist groups directly or indirectly in any way, shape or form, be it through the sale of weapons, field training or intelligence assistance.
[00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:13.645]  And, I mean, think about how many weapons we have sold, given, and accidentally dropped to these so-called moderate rebels who, of course, defected to ISIS or Al-Qaeda because they said that they had more power in the region.
[00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:18.068]  So here, this would have definitely affected the outgoing administration.
[00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:29.592]  But the submitters of the legislation argue that any nations or individuals that are cooperating with Al-Qaeda, the former Al-Nusra Front, or Islamic State should be barred from US funding.
[00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:38.894]  They talk about the fact that if you or I were actually to give money, weapons, or support to Al-Qaeda or ISIS, we would be thrown in jail.
[00:04:39.474 --> 00:04:40.134]  Yet the U.S.
[00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:52.803]  government has been violating this law for years, quietly supporting allies and partners of Al-Qaeda, ISIL, and other terrorist groups with money, weapons, and intelligence support in their fight to overthrow the Syrian government.
[00:04:53.363 --> 00:04:58.727]  So this is happening, of course, and Tulsi Gabbard didn't hold anything back.
[00:04:58.807 --> 00:05:04.531]  She's talking, accusing the CIA of providing weapons and money to terrorist groups all over the world.
[00:05:05.031 --> 00:05:10.556]  Through these covert operations with the help of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, amongst others.
[00:05:10.696 --> 00:05:17.642]  And she, of course, referenced articles from The Washington, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and others to support her claims.
[00:05:18.102 --> 00:05:22.266]  So they couldn't come out and say, oh, well, that's just conspiracy theories and fake news.
[00:05:22.326 --> 00:05:26.670]  No, she went directly to the main perpetrators of the fake news.
[00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.914]  These establishment outlets, of course, that are saying, hey, you know, yes, indeed.
[00:05:31.474 --> 00:05:36.618]  We are funding and arming terrorists and trying to overthrow Assad out of Syria.
[00:05:37.078 --> 00:05:46.605]  Now, Tulsi Gabbard has also spoken out against a lot of the criticism that Donald Trump is facing for recommending three generals for some of his top picks.
[00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:56.932]  And she said she finds this incredibly offensive that people are saying there isn't going to be enough oversight there, not enough citizen oversight of what's going on.
[00:05:57.333 --> 00:05:59.835]  So she said Thursday on CNN's The Lead,
[00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:05.590]  Uh, that criticism of generals on the Trump cabinet is offensive and listen what she had to say.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:15.046]  As a veteran and as someone who's still serving in the Hawaii Army National Guard, I find it pretty offensive for people to outright discriminate against veterans.
[00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:24.953]  Here you have generals who have literally spent their whole lives serving our country, putting service before self, putting their lives on the line to defend democracy.
[00:06:25.293 --> 00:06:35.561]  And yet people are criticizing them and discriminating against them, saying, just because you served as a general previously, you are disqualified from serving in a high position of leadership in our government.
[00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:45.497]  And I can understand where some people might be concerned about, you know, putting people who are incredibly powerful in the military in these very powerful positions.
[00:06:45.897 --> 00:06:47.938]  But look at the state of the world we are in.
[00:06:48.138 --> 00:06:52.501]  Look at the world as it's being handed to President-elect Donald Trump.
[00:06:52.981 --> 00:07:02.368]  And so, indeed, he's saying in order to make America great again, he made no bones about it, he wants to strengthen the military, and we need people in there who understand what's going on.
[00:07:02.948 --> 00:07:18.198]  I've listened to a lot of the talks from the people, the staff picks that he's choosing, and they all seem to have a pretty good grasp, and it's not extreme as the media is trying to portray these people, that they're just going to go in and be these warmongers.
[00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:21.580]  They are saying we need to work with our allies.
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.180]  The U.S.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:39.707]  itself doesn't need to get involved, but we need to be able to distinguish between the different groups that are there and use the help and aid of our allies to take these terrorist organizations out before they spread like cancer across the earth, which is presently what's happening.
[00:07:40.087 --> 00:07:45.749]  Now, in his final address to America's armed forces, President Obama, of course, is not
[00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:54.095]  Trying to unite the country still, he's actually urging soldiers to question Trump's authority, criticize our president.
[00:07:54.455 --> 00:08:05.403]  He goes on to remind them that each of us has the universal right to speak your minds, to protest against authority, to live in a society that's open and free, that can criticize our president without retribution.
[00:08:06.324 --> 00:08:09.486]  Absolutely, there's no truer words have been said.
[00:08:09.986 --> 00:08:16.230]  This is why, you know, even though you don't want the Kaepernicks out there to take a knee or whatever, but that's their right.
[00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.873]  I mean, they live in this country and a lot of military veterans will say that that's why they fought.
[00:08:21.273 --> 00:08:25.235]  So that people like Kaepernick would have the right to take a knee and be disrespectful.
[00:08:25.856 --> 00:08:27.577]  That's the beauty of living in a free country.
[00:08:28.277 --> 00:08:48.382]  But the fact that Barack Obama uses his last address to the armed forces to tell them to question Donald Trump and to say the military's mission is a fight against violent extremism, insisting soldiers need to rise up against Trump if they feel he's pushing policies that are ill-considered,
[00:08:49.102 --> 00:08:59.245]  When this is a president who notoriously purged the military of top brass, top commanders who disagreed with his policies.
[00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:05.727]  That a lot of people were saying, what the hell is this SJW policies being shoved into the military?
[00:09:05.887 --> 00:09:12.369]  And some military and media sources put the Obama administration military purge, the terminations as high as 500.
[00:09:13.169 --> 00:09:17.731]  And that was just during his first five years in the Oval Office.
[00:09:18.171 --> 00:09:19.412]  So, sure, yeah.
[00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:36.422]  He's suggesting to them, you know, if you disagree with your president, then you should let him know, but, you know, as Barack Obama has made clear, he'll just fire you and get rid of you if you speak out, or throw you in jail if you're a whistleblower, and, you know, there again, projecting that sort of hypocrisy.
[00:09:37.483 --> 00:09:38.684]  Do as I say, not as I do.
[00:09:40.054 --> 00:09:57.428]  Now, speaking of a lot of the hypocrisy and dangerous rhetoric that is going out there, we reported earlier in the week about an Orange Coast college teacher who was caught on tape giving this diatribe to her classroom, calling Trump's victory an act of terrorism.
[00:09:57.929 --> 00:09:59.950]  We're really back to being at Civil War.
[00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:05.055]  She was suggesting that President-elect is a white supremacist.
[00:10:05.795 --> 00:10:15.861]  And she's telling her students that the difficult thing about this election loss is that the people who caused the assault are among us, as if Trump supporters are the enemy within.
[00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:30.389]  Talking about how relieved she is that she lives in progressive California, one of the best states, and kind of talks to the class about how she's going to be teaching them coping skills, how to cope with this election loss now.
[00:10:31.534 --> 00:10:45.838]  She is a human sexuality teacher, so I can only guess what those coping skills might be in her class, but what the hell is this kind of talk in a college class where you don't even know half those students might have voted for Donald Trump?
[00:10:45.858 --> 00:10:57.761]  So here you are insulting your students, insulting half the country who voted for him, saying that they're the enemy within and that everyone has to agree with your progressive agenda, meanwhile California is
[00:10:58.735 --> 00:10:59.495]  Bankrupt?
[00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:01.976]  I mean, fiscally if not morally in some places.
[00:11:02.536 --> 00:11:10.560]  But get this, the kicker is that it's the student who filmed this and uploaded it to YouTube that's actually facing expulsion.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.480]  It's the student who is to blame.
[00:11:14.742 --> 00:11:17.344]  What you have to understand is the progressive agenda, right?
[00:11:17.444 --> 00:11:28.656]  The 2030 progressive agenda is that everything you do, think, and say, even your dreams, are going to be out there for consumption, nothing to hide, zero privacy.
[00:11:28.996 --> 00:11:34.862]  So if this student is getting in trouble for filming this super progressive agenda, if that's
[00:11:35.623 --> 00:11:44.495]  You know, if that's what's considered bad, well, what is this teacher going to do in the future when everything's going to be out there for the world and that's what you should be concerned about?
[00:11:44.915 --> 00:11:51.244]  Because it's the conservative people who are being banned from campus, anyone who doesn't agree with that liberal agenda.
[00:11:51.624 --> 00:11:52.985]  They're the ones who are being banned.
[00:11:53.185 --> 00:11:55.226]  They're the ones who are being expelled from school.
[00:11:55.586 --> 00:12:01.509]  And it's the thought police are rounding everyone up and telling you you have to agree with this progressive agenda.
[00:12:01.929 --> 00:12:14.336]  If not, you're going to have the establishment media rallying around you, telling you that the new president incoming is a neo-Nazi who's going to be rounding up Muslim Americans and putting them in internment camps.
[00:12:14.696 --> 00:12:16.679]  So we have totally entered Wally World.
[00:12:16.739 --> 00:12:22.788]  I don't even know what's going to happen with the next four years, but you have to be very wary of the propaganda that's going to be coming out.
[00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:24.130]  We're going to get to that in just a minute.
[00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.414]  They're actually enacting some bills where they're going to be actively
[00:12:28.646 --> 00:12:33.032]  Paying government organizations now to push out this counter propaganda.
[00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:38.739]  But just to let you, kind of give you an idea of how screwed up these college kids are.
[00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:40.481]  There's like a totally lost generation.
[00:12:40.981 --> 00:12:44.846]  So there was a terrorist attack, of course everyone knows, on OSU campus.
[00:12:45.627 --> 00:12:50.270]  And now the OSU Coalition for Black Liberation, it's a campus protest group.
[00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.412]  They held a protest outside the main campus there in Columbus.
[00:12:54.992 --> 00:12:58.934]  It was a rally to protest the death of young black men at the hands of police.
[00:12:58.954 --> 00:13:00.055]  They read off a list.
[00:13:00.815 --> 00:13:01.356]  Of course.
[00:13:20.774 --> 00:13:25.559]  But organizers of the protest said that Arten's particular actions were irrelevant.
[00:13:25.699 --> 00:13:31.746]  It doesn't matter if you're a terrorist trying to commit a mass murder if you're black and a cop shoots you.
[00:13:32.126 --> 00:13:32.647]  That's wrong.
[00:13:32.947 --> 00:13:33.528]  You shouldn't do it.
[00:13:33.588 --> 00:13:34.288]  So this is where...
[00:13:35.438 --> 00:13:43.165]  You know, we've talked a lot about how police officers are given a license to kill, and that's not right, because they can arbitrarily kill people willy-nilly.
[00:13:43.205 --> 00:13:54.895]  And this is where, you know, it's messed up that bad cops have now given good cops a bad name, and it has disabled them from being able to do their job, which is to serve and protect.
[00:13:55.216 --> 00:13:57.498]  And I'm sorry, when the cop shot this
[00:13:57.858 --> 00:14:03.880]  A terrorist who was probably going to go on to kill a lot more people, stab a lot more people there on campus.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:10.002]  He was doing his job, the thing that the citizens of the taxpayers there in Ohio are paying him to do.
[00:14:10.062 --> 00:14:12.923]  These kids are absolutely ridiculous!
[00:14:13.383 --> 00:14:14.164]  Ridiculous!
[00:14:14.964 --> 00:14:24.148]  Speaking of ridiculous, Hillary Clinton rolled out of bed in her purple pantsuit, the queen of fake news.
[00:14:24.548 --> 00:14:29.330]  She came out from under her rock to lecture Americans about the danger of fake news.
[00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.071]  We talked a little bit about this the other day.
[00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:37.414]  She says the epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year
[00:14:38.254 --> 00:14:40.276]  It just has real-world consequences.
[00:14:40.336 --> 00:14:40.956]  It's really bad.
[00:14:41.396 --> 00:14:45.399]  This is a woman who voted for a war that was sold on fake news.
[00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:47.761]  A war that killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:57.548]  This is also a woman who blamed Benghazi on riots due to a YouTube video, even though she knew right away that it was not, that it was an act of terror.
[00:14:57.588 --> 00:14:59.630]  It was not because of some YouTube video.
[00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.792]  Yet she rolled that out and the media ran with it.
[00:15:03.132 --> 00:15:08.274]  And they still refused to check her on it because they wanted this woman to become the next president.
[00:15:08.614 --> 00:15:11.476]  So they didn't check her lies, their little fact check.
[00:15:12.016 --> 00:15:28.963]  Of course, The Intercept reported about how one of the big fake news stories that came out, protecting Clinton of course, was this claim with no facts or evidence whatsoever that the WikiLeaks emails were doctored or fabricated and thus they should be ignored.
[00:15:29.563 --> 00:15:34.645]  MSNBC parroted that lie and said, you know what, no one should even look at these emails.
[00:15:34.685 --> 00:15:35.565]  They've been doctored.
[00:15:35.605 --> 00:15:38.266]  That would be something completely easy to prove.
[00:15:38.406 --> 00:15:43.548]  All you have to do is show the original email next to the WikiLeaks emails to prove that they've been doctored.
[00:15:43.928 --> 00:15:44.869]  But they never did that.
[00:15:45.169 --> 00:15:50.611]  And the media never called them on that and said, well, wait a minute, you saying they'd be doctored or altered?
[00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:51.931]  How so?
[00:15:52.212 --> 00:15:52.852]  Where's the proof?
[00:15:53.112 --> 00:15:54.233]  They never checked them on that.
[00:15:54.273 --> 00:15:58.115]  They just let them roll with that lie because, again, they wanted Clinton in.
[00:15:58.635 --> 00:16:00.757]  And then, this is super hilarious.
[00:16:01.297 --> 00:16:02.337]  Brian Williams.
[00:16:03.218 --> 00:16:06.500]  Okay, and this will just let you know how insane this is.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.383]  Brian Williams, MSNBC's Brian Williams, bemoaned the prevalence of fake news.
[00:16:12.659 --> 00:16:19.845]  He said there's been a lot of coverage in the real news about the growing and booming business of creating fake news.
[00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:31.755]  Brian Williams lost his position as NBC anchor in 2015 after he lied about being under RPG fire while in a helicopter during the Iraq war.
[00:16:32.395 --> 00:16:35.017]  Soldiers who were there said, what the heck are you talking about?
[00:16:35.057 --> 00:16:35.817]  That never happened.
[00:16:35.857 --> 00:16:42.062]  It turns out afterward there were quite a few other stories that he quote, misremembered.
[00:16:42.522 --> 00:16:45.864]  Remember that's what Brian Williams called his lying or his fake news.
[00:16:46.184 --> 00:16:49.347]  He misremembered being under RPG fire.
[00:16:49.827 --> 00:16:50.848]  How do you misremember that?
[00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:55.330]  And then, of course, we had a congressman squaring off with Tucker Carlson.
[00:16:55.350 --> 00:17:02.975]  And he actually, the only defense he had that he was saying, he called Tucker Carlson a Russian agent on live television.
[00:17:03.875 --> 00:17:04.616]  Primetime.
[00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:06.377]  Tucker Carlson just laughed at him.
[00:17:07.017 --> 00:17:08.438]  He was asking for proof from that.
[00:17:08.478 --> 00:17:12.320]  He said, do you have proof that the Podesta emails were hacked by Russia?
[00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:13.941]  And the guy couldn't do it.
[00:17:13.981 --> 00:17:17.804]  He just kept saying over and over again, Party of Reagan, Party of Reagan.
[00:17:18.624 --> 00:17:28.477]  He was trying to get Tucker to embrace the neo-Cold War jingoism, but he could never say that if they had clear proof, clear evidence that Russia did indeed do it.
[00:17:28.737 --> 00:17:30.779]  So he just called Tucker Carlson a Russian agent.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.363]  And then we have Sheriff David Clark.
[00:17:33.743 --> 00:17:46.588]  Who is actually being considered for a spot on Trump's administration, have him calling out, slamming a liberal lawyer on Sean Hannity's show on Fox News, saying the hands-up-don't-shoot narrative was the birthplace of fake news.
[00:17:46.648 --> 00:17:51.891]  That was when it was born and that, you know, there are dead cops because of that fake news story out of Ferguson.
[00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:56.133]  And like I mentioned, what people need to pay attention to.
[00:17:56.973 --> 00:18:05.478]  So we talked a little bit yesterday about a bill that just went through Congress that is going to be dealing with websites and what they deem to be hoax, fake news.
[00:18:05.898 --> 00:18:09.140]  But now there is a new bill that has been announced.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.143]  It's being pushed through the Senate called the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act.
[00:18:14.183 --> 00:18:15.344]  It's part of fiscal year 2017 NDAA.
[00:18:17.885 --> 00:18:23.754]  And it's going to improve the ability of the United States to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation.
[00:18:23.774 --> 00:18:32.187]  They're going to establish an interagency at the State Department to coordinate and synchronize counter propaganda efforts throughout the U.S.
[00:18:32.347 --> 00:18:32.787]  government.
[00:18:33.148 --> 00:18:48.300]  So they're going to be creating a whole organization, putting your tax dollars for NGOs, think tanks, civil society, and other experts outside the government, also known as journalists, who are going to engage in counter-propaganda-related work.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.861]  They say they're doing this because the U.S.
[00:18:49.901 --> 00:18:55.745]  government has been asleep at the wheel, but then why did they repeal the Smith-Month Act in 2013?
[00:18:56.066 --> 00:18:57.607]  In preparation for this, of course.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.203]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:19:46.884 --> 00:19:48.465]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:19:48.865 --> 00:19:53.848]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:59.652]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:20:00.052 --> 00:20:06.636]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:20:07.277 --> 00:20:08.438]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:11.219]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:14.501]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:18.563]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:20:18.743 --> 00:20:21.304]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:20:21.364 --> 00:20:33.711]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:39.053]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:20:39.153 --> 00:20:40.494]  It's bound.
[00:20:40.554 --> 00:20:41.774]  It's not absorbable.
[00:20:42.194 --> 00:20:46.756]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:20:46.976 --> 00:20:51.878]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:20:52.238 --> 00:20:55.960]  It's such a game changer if you'll just research iodine for yourself.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.681]  It's a fact that the federal government in the Midwest back in the 20s
[00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:08.206]  Mandated a grungier form of iodine to the salt because people had low IQs, they had huge goiters, major problems directly connected to it.
[00:21:08.386 --> 00:21:12.048]  There are some studies that show a 15 point increase, others show even higher.
[00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:25.656]  But it really is crazy to realize that this is something that is so deficient in our food chain, so deficient in our played out fields where different crops are being grown, but the federal government isn't educating people and telling them about it.
[00:21:25.856 --> 00:21:37.399]  That's why for a limited time, I want to encourage everyone to go to Infowarslife.com and get 20% off on the best nascent iodine out there from our research, Truly Pure Survival Shield X2.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.260]  Again, that's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.461]  Thank you for joining us in this brief news update.
[00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:48.743]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:21:48.823 --> 00:21:49.983]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:52.724]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:21:52.884 --> 00:21:53.104]  Of course!
[00:22:15.742 --> 00:22:18.343]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:22:18.363 --> 00:22:19.404]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:22:19.744 --> 00:22:20.444]  Iodine is key.
[00:22:20.484 --> 00:22:21.104]  You must have it.
[00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:29.008]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.

[00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:32.630]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:45.387]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:22:46.048 --> 00:22:47.971]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.

[00:22:52.657 --> 00:22:56.002]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.

[00:23:16.255 --> 00:23:19.658]  I'm Ashley Beckford reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:26.503]  I'm about to talk to several people from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln about Native American rights.
[00:23:26.923 --> 00:23:33.408]  So I'm speaking with people who are working and studying at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.
[00:23:33.769 --> 00:23:35.610]  This is Rebecca Schlichting.
[00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.433]  She is an adjunct professor there at the University of Nebraska.
[00:23:39.453 --> 00:23:40.514]  And what do you teach, Rebecca?
[00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:43.813]  I teach an in-depth reporting course on white clay.
[00:23:44.093 --> 00:23:44.954]  Okay, excellent.
[00:23:45.314 --> 00:23:48.276]  And so, do you want to talk about your experience?
[00:23:48.576 --> 00:23:48.917]  Sure.
[00:23:49.017 --> 00:23:54.280]  So, growing up on a reservation was pretty much like growing up in the middle of the country.
[00:23:55.261 --> 00:24:03.047]  There's not much around, there's not much to do, and every once in a while there'll be a powwow or a ceremony or something to take part of like that.
[00:24:03.727 --> 00:24:08.012]  It's not so different as just a regular American home in the country.
[00:24:08.152 --> 00:24:13.397]  We didn't have internet for a really long time, but other than that, it was very much the same.
[00:24:13.478 --> 00:24:17.161]  And my reservation is a lot more tame than other reservations.
[00:24:17.662 --> 00:24:24.169]  So the Pine Ridge Reservation deals with about 90% unemployment, poverty rates,
[00:24:24.973 --> 00:24:33.919]  And fetal alcohol rates of about one in four children, which has been estimated in a 1989 article from the New York Times.
[00:24:33.959 --> 00:24:37.021]  So it's really outdated and some research needs to be done there.
[00:24:37.541 --> 00:24:46.106]  But so my experience was a lot different, but I did grow up very close to my community and my culture.
[00:24:46.747 --> 00:24:48.708]  And so having that experience
[00:24:49.583 --> 00:24:54.605]  I kind of expanded my heart to include all Native people in everything that I do.
[00:24:54.725 --> 00:25:06.028]  And so when I was growing up on the reservation, my elders would tell me to act as your ancestors did and live in accordance to making a good life for the future generations.
[00:25:06.048 --> 00:25:06.429]  Right.
[00:25:06.489 --> 00:25:09.950]  And so that's what I continue to do and that's what the water protectors are doing.
[00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:15.952]  As for white clay, I got involved with this project about a year ago.
[00:25:15.972 --> 00:25:16.052]  Okay.
[00:25:17.011 --> 00:25:19.352]  Because I saw an injustice to Native people.
[00:25:19.752 --> 00:25:25.675]  So White Clay is like a town of 12 people and four liquor stores.
[00:25:26.555 --> 00:25:32.537]  And they sell out 3.8 million cans of beer a year, primarily to the Dry Pine Ridge Reservation.
[00:25:33.638 --> 00:25:38.540]  And so that causes these issues that I was talking about earlier with high domestic violence rates.
[00:25:41.585 --> 00:25:45.611]  And my heart just really goes out to the kids who have to deal with those issues.
[00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.090]  Exactly.
[00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:02.452]  And I know there's also, I believe, a high incidence of rape and alcoholism as well.
[00:26:02.472 --> 00:26:04.133]  Is that correct?
[00:26:04.373 --> 00:26:04.793]  Yeah.
[00:26:05.774 --> 00:26:13.557]  So what's being done by different activists in order to kind of stem the tide of the alcohol?
[00:26:13.577 --> 00:26:17.578]  Because, I mean, you can't stop people from selling and purchasing alcohol.
[00:26:18.058 --> 00:26:21.600]  So what is the solution here with white clay?
[00:26:22.833 --> 00:26:23.113]  Right.
[00:26:23.193 --> 00:26:26.574]  So in a town of 12 people, there's four liquor stores.
[00:26:27.114 --> 00:26:32.536]  So if you think about a place like Lincoln, Nebraska, that's one liquor store for every three people.
[00:26:32.556 --> 00:26:36.497]  Well, of course, that's breeding grounds for terrible things.
[00:26:37.357 --> 00:26:39.578]  Human trafficking goes on in this area.
[00:26:39.838 --> 00:26:42.419]  Unsolved murders happen because there's no police.
[00:26:43.119 --> 00:26:44.299]  There's no law enforcement.
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:49.681]  And so a few things activists are doing or is trying to get the liquor stores shut down.
[00:26:50.165 --> 00:27:00.012]  There's a group of activists here in Lincoln which are working together with other entities to find evidence of these things that happen in White Clay because of these four liquor stores.
[00:27:00.332 --> 00:27:07.897]  And they sell things like a big tall boy can of malt liquor that has 10.5% alcohol in it.
[00:27:08.257 --> 00:27:16.883]  A mother drinks one of these and her blood alcohol content goes to 0.2 which means her baby's blood alcohol content is also 0.2 which is why
[00:27:18.936 --> 00:27:19.236]  Yeah.
[00:27:27.475 --> 00:27:28.396]  The national average.
[00:27:29.436 --> 00:27:36.240]  How do you get around the fact, though, that you can't stop people from buying and selling alcohol?
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:41.223]  I mean, that's that's their right to do so, you know, to consume it, to buy it, to sell it.
[00:27:42.184 --> 00:27:43.765]  So how do you get around that?
[00:27:43.825 --> 00:27:51.990]  Because, I mean, for me, it seems like it's a substance abuse issue and it's more of, you know, an issue where people need counselors, they need
[00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.511]  Yeah, well, there's a lot of things happening there.
[00:27:54.551 --> 00:27:55.371]  They sell to drunk people.
[00:28:21.584 --> 00:28:24.867]  They sell to underage people, and these have been documented.
[00:28:25.488 --> 00:28:32.394]  And this wouldn't be allowed to happen in any other place with a bigger population.
[00:28:33.735 --> 00:28:38.299]  If this was happening in Lincoln, the store would be shut down because of what it produces.
[00:28:38.846 --> 00:28:40.966]  So just selling these out.
[00:28:40.986 --> 00:28:47.008]  So the Liquor Commission has laws that the people with liquor licenses need to abide by.
[00:28:47.068 --> 00:28:50.048]  For instance, they're supposed to further temperance.
[00:28:50.448 --> 00:29:03.991]  Selling a 10.5 Tallboy, 10.5 alcohol content Tallboy can does not promote temperance in a community because you only drink that to get drunk.
[00:29:05.151 --> 00:29:07.672]  And so there's a lot of things that are happening there.
[00:29:08.294 --> 00:29:11.136]  That are unlawful and shouldn't be going on.
[00:29:12.577 --> 00:29:23.243]  So you kind of want to just enforce the rule of law and also maybe install like maybe some of these like blue light laws where you know, you're only able to consume at a certain time.
[00:29:23.283 --> 00:29:25.984]  Is that what you think would help people there?
[00:29:26.805 --> 00:29:31.808]  Some people have talked about getting rid of the buying one beer rule because
[00:29:32.441 --> 00:29:38.602]  That would help because a lot of times the beer that is sold there is just one single can of this malt liquor.
[00:29:39.663 --> 00:29:42.803]  But also they need more detox facilities.
[00:29:42.823 --> 00:29:44.844]  They need more treatment centers in this area.
[00:29:44.864 --> 00:29:48.064]  There isn't any detox centers at all.
[00:29:48.444 --> 00:29:50.725]  And treatment centers are very hard to come by as well.
[00:29:50.785 --> 00:29:53.165]  People have to be sent to Cincinnati, Ohio.
[00:29:54.026 --> 00:29:54.686]  Things like that.
[00:29:54.866 --> 00:29:56.446]  And how far of a distance is that?
[00:29:57.686 --> 00:29:59.407]  Oh, I have no idea how.
[00:29:59.887 --> 00:30:00.587]  I don't know what the
[00:30:01.249 --> 00:30:02.590]  Probably 15 hours.
[00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:11.393]  Yeah, it could be about 15 hours, Triani says, and if that's the case, you know, that gives the person time to go into a seizure from withdrawal, so it can be very dangerous.
[00:30:12.493 --> 00:30:23.537]  You know, their solution is to put the people in jail that are drunk, but then they run into the problem, well, if the person dies while they're in jail because of withdrawal, then the jail is held accountable for that.
[00:30:24.178 --> 00:30:31.301]  Yeah, the problem is that when you put people in jail who have addictions, that actually doesn't solve the addiction.
[00:30:31.341 --> 00:30:35.943]  There's no rehabilitation that ends up happening, so they need treatment centers.
[00:30:36.103 --> 00:30:41.866]  And basically, nationwide, we need a revamping of the system.
[00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:46.388]  And actually, Trump has talked about this in, I believe it was the third debate.
[00:30:46.468 --> 00:30:52.951]  He talked about heroin and how he wants to basically stop this tide of addiction.
[00:30:53.331 --> 00:30:54.672]  That's just sweeping the country.
[00:30:55.333 --> 00:30:57.054]  Drugs are pouring in through the border.
[00:30:57.214 --> 00:30:59.296]  We have no country if we have no border.
[00:30:59.596 --> 00:31:01.117]  Hillary wants to give amnesty.
[00:31:01.197 --> 00:31:02.659]  She wants to have open borders.
[00:31:03.099 --> 00:31:09.564]  The border secure, as you know, the Border Patrol agent, 16,500 plus ICE last week, endorsed me.
[00:31:09.604 --> 00:31:11.586]  First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.
[00:31:12.366 --> 00:31:13.808]  It means their job is tougher.
[00:31:14.248 --> 00:31:15.549]  But they know what's going on.
[00:31:15.749 --> 00:31:17.110]  They know it better than anybody.
[00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:17.991]  They want
[00:31:18.551 --> 00:31:19.312]  Strong borders.
[00:31:19.392 --> 00:31:20.973]  They feel we have to have strong borders.
[00:31:21.313 --> 00:31:22.875]  I was up in New Hampshire the other day.
[00:31:22.895 --> 00:31:36.045]  The biggest complaint they have, with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama, all of the problems, their single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.
[00:31:36.065 --> 00:31:37.846]  It's just pouring and destroying their youth.
[00:31:37.926 --> 00:31:40.948]  It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.
[00:31:41.949 --> 00:31:44.415]  We have to have strong borders.
[00:31:44.756 --> 00:31:46.801]  We have to keep the drugs out of our country.
[00:31:47.403 --> 00:31:49.768]  Right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.
[00:31:50.936 --> 00:32:02.427]  I mean, I don't know if that's a problem on the Indian reservations, but I know, you know, here in Austin, we have the people with the spice and, you know, K2 or whatever you call it, the so-called synthetic marijuana.
[00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:07.472]  So there's a lot of different drugs out there that are really, really plaguing people.
[00:32:07.933 --> 00:32:11.016]  And the solution is to put people in prison.
[00:32:11.456 --> 00:32:12.017]  They, you know,
[00:32:13.297 --> 00:32:24.323]  These corporations, huge prison, private prison corporations, just continue to get more and more money and funding and, you know, just there's no justice that's actually being done.
[00:32:24.423 --> 00:32:27.765]  So do you know if that's an epidemic on the reservations?
[00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:29.185]  Heroin or K2?
[00:32:29.245 --> 00:32:33.027]  Are those actually something that's affecting Native people right now?
[00:32:33.968 --> 00:32:37.250]  Meth is affecting Native people right now in many communities.
[00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:39.811]  That's more prevalent than
[00:32:41.128 --> 00:32:43.429]  Meth and alcohol are more prevalent than anything else.
[00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:45.010]  Okay.
[00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:57.475]  Yeah, it's just, it's so many addictions going on right now, but Trump actually did say that he wants to focus more on actually rehabilitating people than throwing them in prisons.
[00:32:57.515 --> 00:32:59.996]  You know, more treatment centers, more health care.
[00:33:02.435 --> 00:33:07.218]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.418 --> 00:33:08.999]  I ran six miles almost every day.
[00:33:09.019 --> 00:33:11.840]  I would lift weights four or five days a week for up to three hours.
[00:33:12.401 --> 00:33:16.983]  I was really into what I was doing, but I also loved to go to buffets and pig out.
[00:33:17.023 --> 00:33:17.704]  I was a young man.
[00:33:18.304 --> 00:33:20.345]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down.
[00:33:20.726 --> 00:33:21.686]  I quit working out.
[00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:27.069]  I was working 18 hours a day, many days, on average about 14, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:33.652]  I went from 180 to right up to 280 pounds.
[00:33:33.832 --> 00:33:36.753]  And I started to exercise really hard again.
[00:33:37.173 --> 00:33:38.753]  And I started to try to eat healthier.
[00:33:39.233 --> 00:33:41.414]  But for some reason, I couldn't lose more than 20 pounds.
[00:33:41.494 --> 00:33:43.895]  Couldn't go below about 259.
[00:33:45.075 --> 00:33:46.716]  Started taking third-party supplements.
[00:33:47.116 --> 00:33:48.936]  Started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:49.457 --> 00:33:56.899]  But when I started working with Dr. Grip and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that
[00:33:57.319 --> 00:33:59.720]  The population is absolutely deficient in.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:06.463]  Take this true atomic iodine that they were just developing and wasn't even available in stores yet.
[00:34:07.123 --> 00:34:07.464]  Boom!
[00:34:08.184 --> 00:34:09.625]  Weight started pouring off.
[00:34:09.725 --> 00:34:11.605]  Toxins started coming out of my body.
[00:34:12.106 --> 00:34:12.926]  It was incredible.
[00:34:12.966 --> 00:34:18.548]  Then I started taking DNA force, super male vitality, and I went down to 230 pounds.
[00:34:18.568 --> 00:34:24.111]  Now understand, that's losing 60, 70 pounds of fat and gaining, I don't know, 20 pounds of muscle?
[00:34:25.086 --> 00:34:25.406]  All I know
[00:34:44.918 --> 00:34:54.265]  But more importantly, I stopped taking the supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:34:54.365 --> 00:34:55.326]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:34:55.526 --> 00:35:02.051]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put Lazy Susan back on the table and I'm going to start taking it religiously again.
[00:35:02.851 --> 00:35:06.074]  And I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:35:06.114 --> 00:35:07.395]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:35:07.996 --> 00:35:12.059]  And I've already experienced what this has done before, but this time we're going to document it.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.063]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:35:16.624 --> 00:35:20.187]  My gut tells me I'll lose at least 10 pounds even during the holidays.
[00:35:20.567 --> 00:35:45.424]  Taking the supplements because again, it's what I've experienced before but we're gonna see I'm gonna work out just the same probably eat even more But I'm gonna take the x2 the DNA force the super male every single day as it's recommended And we're all gonna see the results look we're making America great again We're restoring the Republic and part of that is making ourselves great again our bodies great again and feeling good about ourselves I don't plan to be some Beach Boy
[00:35:46.164 --> 00:35:48.205]  I've got kind of bodybuilder form.
[00:35:48.225 --> 00:35:48.785]  I'm a big guy.
[00:35:49.085 --> 00:35:53.966]  But we're going to see what happens in the next 30 days together on this journey.
[00:35:53.986 --> 00:35:56.427]  And we'll have updates every week on what's happening.
[00:35:57.147 --> 00:36:04.529]  And we will also then obviously take the four weeks and put it all together in a special report that's going to air January 5th.
[00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.330]  Now, I'll be frank with you.
[00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:07.710]  I'm still having treats.
[00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.131]  I'm still living like I normally do.
[00:36:09.371 --> 00:36:10.591]  This wasn't part of what we were about to do.
[00:36:10.631 --> 00:36:11.732]  And I'm not saying it's good.
[00:36:12.052 --> 00:36:12.792]  I'm embarrassed of it.
[00:36:14.249 --> 00:36:14.929]  Mexican Coke.
[00:36:15.409 --> 00:36:17.010]  Buckley's over there and he made the joke earlier.
[00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:19.271]  Oh yeah, you're really going to lose weight drinking Mexican Coke.
[00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:20.912]  I'm just being totally transparent.
[00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:21.892]  I'm going to eat pie.
[00:36:22.252 --> 00:36:22.973]  Christmas is coming up.
[00:36:23.013 --> 00:36:24.953]  I'm going to eat ham and turkey.
[00:36:26.374 --> 00:36:26.934]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:27.514 --> 00:36:27.995]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:28.655 --> 00:36:36.358]  These nutraceuticals have really spoiled me because I work out less and was just losing weight.
[00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:38.439]  As long as I took them.
[00:36:38.459 --> 00:36:40.280]  Then when I quit taking them, I've gained some weight.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.640]  So we're going to see what happens.
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.181]  But I've experienced this.
[00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:45.381]  You need to experience this for yourself.
[00:36:45.501 --> 00:36:46.422]  It's December 5, 2016.
[00:36:46.542 --> 00:36:50.143]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:36:51.123 --> 00:37:00.826]  And I want to invite all of the InfoWarriors of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:37:13.289 --> 00:37:15.249]  Oh, I love this country so much.
[00:37:15.269 --> 00:37:25.491]  Right now we can't see much of anything, and frankly, this is what we can show you on television right now because of military restrictions from both the Saudis and the U.S.
[00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:31.453]  CD, if you need to take cover, I notice that you've got your gas mask in your hands.
[00:37:31.533 --> 00:37:33.533]  If you need to put it on, please do so.
[00:37:39.577 --> 00:37:43.158]  The fake news pros want you to know they've got this.
[00:37:43.658 --> 00:37:48.379]  Take it from bold-faced lying fake news aficionado Brian Williams.
[00:37:48.839 --> 00:37:55.321]  As we talked about here last night, fake news played a role in this election and continues to find a wide audience.
[00:37:55.881 --> 00:38:08.204]  A BuzzFeed News study of Donald Trump's own tweets, where they follow back news stories to their root source, found more of them came from Breitbart originally than from any other single source.
[00:38:08.664 --> 00:38:12.867]  Here's a look at his outstanding delusional reporting from March of 2003.
[00:38:39.605 --> 00:38:45.751]  Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire, including the one I was in.
[00:38:46.051 --> 00:38:47.232]  I want to apologize.
[00:38:47.332 --> 00:38:51.396]  I said I was traveling in an aircraft that was hit by RPG fire.
[00:38:51.857 --> 00:38:54.679]  I was instead in a following aircraft.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:02.587]  We all landed after the ground fire incident and spent two harrowing nights in a sandstorm in the Iraq desert.
[00:39:02.887 --> 00:39:06.370]  What drove Mr. Williams to take fake news to another level?
[00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:11.995]  Perhaps he felt overshadowed by Hillary Clinton's living in the danger zone fantasy.
[00:39:12.195 --> 00:39:14.437]  No one can lie like Hillary Clinton.
[00:39:14.617 --> 00:39:17.079]  She is a fake news phenom.
[00:39:17.399 --> 00:39:19.441]  I remember landing under sniper fire.
[00:39:20.001 --> 00:39:26.707]  There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles.
[00:39:27.607 --> 00:39:28.588]  To get to our base.
[00:39:28.928 --> 00:39:32.411]  You know, I made a mistake in describing it.
[00:39:32.831 --> 00:39:41.038]  She claimed she misspoke last week and was sleep deprived when she described landing under sniper fire in Tuzla, Bosnia, something that didn't happen.
[00:39:41.618 --> 00:39:49.324]  But CBS News has found several times in the past few months when Senator Clinton used the Bosnia trip to try to show her international experience.
[00:39:49.684 --> 00:39:51.065]  December in Iowa.
[00:39:51.185 --> 00:39:53.928]  We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and
[00:39:54.748 --> 00:39:57.129]  Ran out because they said there might be sniper fire.
[00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:03.072]  Then in February, the welcoming ceremony had to be moved inside because of sniper fire.
[00:40:04.053 --> 00:40:08.715]  And here are Hillary's supporters greeting her after, whoops, wrong video.
[00:40:09.176 --> 00:40:11.597]  Almost stepped in a pile of fake news there.
[00:40:11.777 --> 00:40:12.557]  Sorry about that.
[00:40:12.677 --> 00:40:18.701]  Here is Hillary greeting her supporters after making this historic speech on fake news.
[00:40:18.961 --> 00:40:23.003]  The epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that
[00:40:23.735 --> 00:40:26.296]  Flooded social media over the past year.
[00:40:27.376 --> 00:40:32.578]  It's now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences.
[00:40:33.699 --> 00:40:36.300]  This isn't about politics or partisanship.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.300]  Lives are at risk.
[00:40:38.681 --> 00:40:41.962]  Nobody has died from this scourge of fake news.
[00:40:42.182 --> 00:40:48.484]  However, plenty of police have died from the narrative of the mainstream media brainwashing monstrosity.
[00:40:48.504 --> 00:40:51.625]  We have dead cops because of that hands up, don't shoot, lie.
[00:40:51.665 --> 00:40:52.666]  We had two in New York.
[00:40:53.146 --> 00:40:57.429]  We also had five in Dallas and some in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
[00:40:57.469 --> 00:41:00.812]  People were trying to avenge for the life of Mike Brown, who was a thug.
[00:41:00.852 --> 00:41:05.495]  There are dead cops because of that fake news story out of Ferguson, Missouri.
[00:41:05.595 --> 00:41:13.641]  There were many, many cases of African-Americans being stopped, African-Americans being harassed, mock appeased, and the civil rights movement.
[00:41:13.861 --> 00:41:19.285]  Come on, who needs truth when you've got these self-important New World Order mouthpieces?
[00:41:19.505 --> 00:41:20.986]  They've got it in the bag.
[00:41:21.254 --> 00:41:22.354]  People talk about fake news.
[00:41:22.374 --> 00:41:23.074]  They don't understand.
[00:41:23.154 --> 00:41:24.735]  It's the result of fake prices.
[00:41:25.135 --> 00:41:31.696]  All the false government statistics that have come out, all the market manipulation, the precious metals, all the kind of insider dealings.
[00:41:31.796 --> 00:41:34.756]  Sure, you've got fake news reporting on fake economic numbers.
[00:41:34.796 --> 00:41:34.957]  Right.
[00:41:35.117 --> 00:41:38.637]  And you have robots who are trading on these fake prices.
[00:41:38.977 --> 00:41:40.958]  And then that spills over into fake news.
[00:41:41.438 --> 00:41:44.278]  So, I mean, I'm... So, it's a shovel-throwing prophecy.
[00:41:44.938 --> 00:41:45.198]  It is.
[00:41:45.378 --> 00:41:45.919]  It always is.
[00:42:10.023 --> 00:42:13.966]  I'm going to discuss our action plan to make America great again.
[00:42:14.006 --> 00:42:16.327]  We're going to discuss it.
[00:42:16.387 --> 00:42:20.270]  Remember when they said he cannot win North Carolina?
[00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:22.331]  So we had just won Ohio.
[00:42:23.612 --> 00:42:24.913]  And we had just won Florida.
[00:42:24.953 --> 00:42:25.794]  Breaking news.
[00:42:25.874 --> 00:42:27.855]  Donald Trump has won Florida.
[00:42:27.895 --> 00:42:28.676]  They're saying, whoa.
[00:42:31.437 --> 00:42:32.438]  And we won it big.
[00:42:34.419 --> 00:42:39.623]  But then the people back there, the extremely dishonest press, said,
[00:42:51.391 --> 00:42:52.591]  Very dishonest people.
[00:42:57.313 --> 00:43:14.419]  How about, how about, I mean how dishonest, how about when a major anchor who hosted a debate started crying when she realized that we won?
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.060]  How about that?
[00:43:21.721 --> 00:43:22.241]  Tears.
[00:43:24.022 --> 00:43:25.623]  No, tell me this isn't true.
[00:43:26.383 --> 00:43:28.144]  And you know what she doesn't understand?
[00:43:28.904 --> 00:43:30.505]  Things are going to be much better now.
[00:43:30.525 --> 00:43:34.326]  She doesn't understand.
[00:43:34.366 --> 00:43:37.828]  Remember, you cannot get to 270.
[00:43:38.148 --> 00:43:39.948]  The dishonest press.
[00:43:41.129 --> 00:43:43.090]  There is no road.
[00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:48.272]  Folks, how many times did we hear this?
[00:43:49.363 --> 00:43:51.785]  There is no path to 2-7.
[00:43:51.825 --> 00:43:54.227]  There is no path.
[00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:58.670]  There is no path.
[00:44:07.998 --> 00:44:14.203]  They said, I'll tell you what, just two, three weeks before the election, and my friends would tell me just the opposite.
[00:44:14.243 --> 00:44:15.584]  They live in Texas and Georgia.
[00:44:16.311 --> 00:44:18.392]  They said, Georgia is in play.
[00:44:19.093 --> 00:44:20.434]  Texas is in play.
[00:44:20.794 --> 00:44:21.975]  That means like we're even.
[00:44:23.376 --> 00:44:25.137]  And then we won in a landslide, both states.
[00:44:25.197 --> 00:44:25.917]  I said, what happened?
[00:44:31.841 --> 00:44:35.283]  They go, for weeks, Texas is in play.
[00:44:36.104 --> 00:44:40.327]  Then you turn on the television, like two minutes later, Donald Trump has won Texas.
[00:44:45.796 --> 00:44:48.458]  These are very, very dishonest people.
[00:44:48.858 --> 00:44:48.958]  Okay.
[00:44:58.224 --> 00:44:59.085]  I love this stuff.
[00:44:59.105 --> 00:45:01.266]  Should I go on with this just a little bit longer?
[00:45:01.287 --> 00:45:04.569]  I love it.
[00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:14.996]  How about, it's like 12 o'clock in the evening, and Pennsylvania, I'm leading by a lot.
[00:45:16.434 --> 00:45:17.715]  And we couldn't get off 98%.
[00:45:18.155 --> 00:45:21.879]  They didn't want to call.
[00:45:22.599 --> 00:45:25.141]  We're leading by so much that it's impossible.
[00:45:25.201 --> 00:45:26.462]  I lost every other vote.
[00:45:27.503 --> 00:45:28.664]  And they refused to call.
[00:45:28.684 --> 00:45:33.068]  Then at 3 o'clock, I'll never forget, I watched a particular person.
[00:45:33.989 --> 00:45:35.410]  And we won Wisconsin.
[00:45:36.351 --> 00:45:37.351]  And we won Michigan.
[00:45:38.492 --> 00:45:39.853]  And we won Pennsylvania.
[00:45:41.255 --> 00:45:41.475]  Right?
[00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:46.051]  And that person is doing the map.
[00:45:47.212 --> 00:45:56.116]  And that person was saying for months that there's no way that Donald Trump can break the blue wall, right?
[00:46:00.558 --> 00:46:02.779]  We didn't break it, we shattered that sucker.
[00:46:03.399 --> 00:46:06.000]  We shattered it.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:06.660]  We shattered it.
[00:46:07.801 --> 00:46:08.141]  Man.
[00:46:10.342 --> 00:46:12.283]  That poor wall is busted up.
[00:46:13.973 --> 00:46:17.795]  So, I'll never forget it though, because it felt so good.
[00:46:18.335 --> 00:46:22.377]  You know, more so because they kept saying there's no path and all this nonsense.
[00:46:22.897 --> 00:46:28.400]  So, and I go out and I see the people like this, and I'd say, how are we going to lose?
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.460]  I mean, how are we going to lose?
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:30.401]  But what happened?
[00:46:31.101 --> 00:46:33.882]  So they'd say, we win Wisconsin.
[00:46:34.382 --> 00:46:36.783]  Donald Trump, 38 years or so.
[00:46:37.424 --> 00:46:40.525]  Donald Trump has won Michigan.
[00:46:40.605 --> 00:46:42.146]  And then they're looking at the map, they're saying,
[00:46:43.525 --> 00:46:44.205]  Oh, wow.
[00:46:44.986 --> 00:46:50.788]  There's no way for Hillary Clinton to become President.
[00:46:50.868 --> 00:46:58.632]  Donald Trump is President of the United States.
[00:46:58.652 --> 00:46:59.032]  Amazing.
[00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:11.162]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:20.944]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.364 --> 00:47:25.205]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.225 --> 00:47:28.326]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.726 --> 00:47:29.806]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.632 --> 00:49:02.294]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:23.991 --> 00:49:32.674]  Historically, when governments move against free press, major wars and absolute horrors are committed against the people.
[00:49:33.575 --> 00:49:44.379]  As we speak, the European Union is openly calling to shut down the quote alt-right in the United States and is ordering Facebook, Google and others to censor InfoWars.com by name.
[00:49:45.239 --> 00:49:46.840]  If InfoWars can be silenced,
[00:49:47.682 --> 00:49:48.963]  You can be silenced as well.
[00:49:49.764 --> 00:49:51.386]  Let's stand up for a free press.
[00:49:51.987 --> 00:49:55.631]  Let's stand up for free speech, not just here in the US, but worldwide.
[00:49:56.211 --> 00:49:59.114]  That's what our Bill of Rights and Constitution are all about.
[00:50:00.176 --> 00:50:01.877]  That's why it's called the First Amendment.
[00:50:02.518 --> 00:50:05.621]  First, because it is the most important.
[00:50:06.142 --> 00:50:09.125]  If we shut down free speech, the light goes out of the world.
[00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:31.366]  Thank you, thank you so much!
[00:50:57.005 --> 00:50:58.886]  Mastockham Syndrome.
[00:51:00.047 --> 00:51:02.129]  Submit to your masters.
[00:51:15.247 --> 00:51:18.729]  Hey Germany, so how's that cultural enrichment working out for you?
[00:51:18.789 --> 00:51:26.754]  Since Germany opened its borders to cultural enrichment, there have been an extra 402,000 crimes committed by migrants.
[00:51:26.834 --> 00:51:31.857]  Illegal immigrants and asylum seekers are vastly over-represented in every sector of crime.
[00:51:31.977 --> 00:51:33.978]  Oh, well that's just right-wing propaganda.
[00:51:34.018 --> 00:51:35.959]  Who believes any of that stuff anyway?
[00:51:36.199 --> 00:51:38.360]  Oh no, it's actually the government's own statistics.
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.081]  I've been here for almost 39 years.
[00:51:40.201 --> 00:51:44.684]  This country, where it came from, three or two years ago, has done so much shit here in Germany.
[00:51:44.804 --> 00:51:53.729]  19-year-old German refugee activist Maria Ladenberger was raped, murdered and dumped in a river in Freiburg by an Afghan refugee.
[00:51:53.769 --> 00:51:57.131]  An Iraqi refugee also raped two Chinese students in Bochum.
[00:51:57.191 --> 00:52:02.715]  A 19-year-old migrant raped a 90-year-old woman as she was leaving a church in downtown Dusseldorf.
[00:52:02.795 --> 00:52:07.978]  Two migrants raped a 23-year-old woman in Lunenburg as she was walking in a park with her young child.
[00:52:08.038 --> 00:52:10.859]  A 16-year-old girl was gang-raped in a park in Hamburg.
[00:52:10.919 --> 00:52:11.800]  Her attackers got off
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.562]  With suspended sentences.
[00:52:13.682 --> 00:52:17.847]  Girls as young as nine were molested by migrants at a swimming pool in Berlin.
[00:52:17.927 --> 00:52:21.552]  Four women were sexually assaulted by migrants at a party in Essen.
[00:52:21.672 --> 00:52:24.916]  One resident of Essen told a live televised town hall meeting,
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:36.202]  Migrants who previously bombed a Sikh temple planned to kill kindergartners with poisoned ice cream before blowing up a school in Essen.
[00:52:36.282 --> 00:52:43.364]  A soldier of the Islamic State was responsible for a knife-wielding rampage through Hamburg in which two teenagers were attacked and one killed.
[00:52:43.444 --> 00:52:49.885]  A couple of weeks ago, a Syrian refugee was arrested in Stuttgart with bomb materials plotting an ISIS attack.
[00:52:50.005 --> 00:52:56.187]  The mayor of a picturesque German ski town is begging for help to tackle an explosive refugee crime wave.
[00:52:56.367 --> 00:52:57.427]  I could go on.
[00:52:57.907 --> 00:53:02.210]  This is all just in the last six weeks.
[00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:08.273]  And what does the German government have to say about all this?
[00:53:08.293 --> 00:53:09.574]  So there's a migrant crime explosion.
[00:53:09.594 --> 00:53:10.454]  People are being raped and killed.
[00:53:10.574 --> 00:53:12.996]  And migrants are being arrested for plotting massive terror attacks.
[00:53:24.042 --> 00:53:28.025]  And your main concern is mean tweets and Facebook posts.
[00:53:28.105 --> 00:53:33.810]  Facebook banned a German woman for posting a picture of the rapist murderer.
[00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:40.515]  They said it was hate speech to post a photograph of the killer that had already been published by the media.
[00:53:40.555 --> 00:53:50.824]  Remember, it was Facebook and the German government who announced last year that they were working with an ex-Stasi official to hunt down people who make xenophobic comments about the migrant crisis.
[00:53:51.084 --> 00:54:00.635]  Apparently, German citizens should be following the lead of the German media, who dutifully followed orders to cover up the mass molestation of women in Cologne on New Year's Eve.
[00:54:00.735 --> 00:54:08.765]  One of Germany's biggest news shows refused to cover the rape and murder of Maria Ladenberger, insisting that it was just a local news story.
[00:54:09.105 --> 00:54:12.609]  After the story had already made global headlines!
[00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:15.251]  But we really should just shut up about all this.
[00:54:15.532 --> 00:54:17.634]  Because it might radicalize the middle class.
[00:54:17.994 --> 00:54:22.559]  And God forbid, people might start to get angry about their daughters being raped.
[00:54:23.299 --> 00:54:24.260]  And we can't allow that.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.824]  Oh, and don't you dare fly that German flag in Germany!
[00:54:28.244 --> 00:54:29.666]  Because it might offend somebody.
[00:54:33.289 --> 00:54:36.391]  While migrants march through German streets in huge mobs.
[00:54:36.451 --> 00:54:43.314]  But hey, the government has some German chick dancing around in a commercial, wearing a hijab, telling everyone to get used to it.
[00:54:53.419 --> 00:54:55.782]  Enjoy difference, start tolerance.
[00:54:55.942 --> 00:54:57.584]  So I guess that's the solution, right?
[00:54:57.624 --> 00:54:59.846]  Just cover up and maybe you won't get raped.
[00:55:00.087 --> 00:55:02.229]  Just keep the rapist at arm's length.
[00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:04.652]  Or even better, use the force.
[00:55:04.852 --> 00:55:07.916]  I mean, it's not like you imported a culture that has something that's
[00:55:08.336 --> 00:55:10.498]  It's really called The Rape Game.
[00:55:10.638 --> 00:55:16.203]  Maybe Germany can follow Italy's lead and just force people to hand over their property to migrants.
[00:55:16.443 --> 00:55:18.725]  After all, we don't want to offend them.
[00:55:18.785 --> 00:55:23.489]  German President Joachim Gauck said he believed that Germany will eventually have a Muslim president.
[00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:25.150]  Maybe that will keep them happy.
[00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:31.615]  Green Party politician Volker Beck said Germans need to learn Arabic and that migrants shouldn't have to speak German.
[00:55:31.696 --> 00:55:32.837]  And that makes sense.
[00:55:33.097 --> 00:55:40.823]  Because as Green Party politician Stephanie von Berg celebrated, Germans will be a minority in their own cities within 30 years.
[00:55:41.224 --> 00:55:42.525]  And that's a good thing.
[00:55:42.765 --> 00:55:45.490]  I'm telling you very clearly, here to the right, that's good.
[00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:47.614]  I've been here for 20 years, Mark.
[00:56:04.492 --> 00:56:08.775]  After all, they burned down their own migrant center because there wasn't enough Nutella.
[00:56:08.895 --> 00:56:10.376]  We don't want to upset them.
[00:56:10.556 --> 00:56:20.342]  And don't worry about all those rapes and molestations because taxpayers are funding a new police operation to keep everyone safe in Cologne on New Year's Eve this time around.
[00:56:20.442 --> 00:56:24.164]  Teams of specially trained officers to handle sexual assault victims.
[00:56:24.444 --> 00:56:30.985]  Right, so you're not actually going to try to prevent sexual assaults, you're just gonna have a chat with the victims afterwards.
[00:56:31.446 --> 00:56:32.046]  Great!
[00:56:32.266 --> 00:56:34.826]  But Angela Merkel is on top of things.
[00:56:35.286 --> 00:56:48.089]  I mean, she's not gonna do anything to stop a million mostly male migrants from pouring in every year, but she might ask some of the women to refrain from wearing burkas in certain public places at certain times.
[00:56:48.229 --> 00:56:49.149]  Thanks, Angela!
[00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:51.330]  And anyway, who am I to criticise?
[00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:55.354]  I mean, Merkel enjoys widespread support.
[00:56:55.374 --> 00:56:59.039]  55% of Germans say they will vote for her again in the next election.
[00:56:59.219 --> 00:57:05.747]  Ensuring Germany will continue to reap the benefits of cultural enrichment for many years to come.
[00:57:14.522 --> 00:57:16.804]  We have a great, great cabinet, I'll tell you.
[00:57:16.904 --> 00:57:19.626]  It's coming and wait until you see what we have next week.
[00:57:20.087 --> 00:57:22.789]  Are we doing a good job with our cabinet and our people?
[00:57:31.116 --> 00:57:40.183]  And I don't want to tell you, I don't want to tell you this, because I want to save the suspense for next week.
[00:57:41.764 --> 00:57:43.266]  So I will not tell you
[00:57:44.688 --> 00:57:47.751]  I refuse to tell you, and don't let it outside of this room.
[00:57:47.771 --> 00:57:48.511]  Do you promise?
[00:57:48.612 --> 00:57:49.192]  Raise your hand.
[00:57:49.492 --> 00:57:49.993]  Promise.
[00:57:54.677 --> 00:58:05.747]  So I will not tell you that one of our great, great generals... Don't let it outside, right?
[00:58:07.788 --> 00:58:09.410]  And of course, the press is very honest.
[00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:10.491]  They'll never let this go.
[00:58:12.208 --> 00:58:15.090]  Even though it's all live, they've got about seven stations live.
[00:58:17.392 --> 00:58:27.559]  We are going to appoint Mad Dog Matters as our Secretary of Defense.
[00:58:35.605 --> 00:58:39.328]  But we're not announcing it till Monday, so don't tell anybody.
[00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:47.142]  They say he's the closest thing to General George Patton that we have and it's about time.
[00:58:47.283 --> 00:58:51.365]  It's about time.
[00:58:51.885 --> 00:58:53.346]  Well that's gonna do it for the show tonight.
[00:58:53.406 --> 00:58:57.748]  Thank you so much for tuning in and we will see you here again next week 7 p.m.
[00:58:57.788 --> 00:58:58.148]  Central.
[00:58:58.348 --> 00:58:59.029]  Have a great weekend.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:38.608]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.268 --> 00:59:41.709]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:59:42.089 --> 00:59:47.590]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:54.693]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
