[00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.781]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.383]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:20.064 --> 00:00:20.865]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:22.546]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.187 --> 00:00:26.811]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:31.435]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.504 --> 00:00:42.526]  All right ladies and gentlemen, get ready.
[00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:52.556]  We have Congressman Walter Jones joining us on huge 28 pages 9-11 attack news and more coming up today.
[00:00:53.196 --> 00:00:58.741]  We're also going to have open phones and Anthony Gucciardi will be hosting the fourth hour.
[00:01:00.283 --> 00:01:05.228]  Obviously the new big sensation is Trump saying women that get illegal abortions should be punished.
[00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:07.651]  And now he's kind of backtracked off that.
[00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:12.301]  If you got illegal brain surgery, I think whoever does it should be punished.
[00:01:13.268 --> 00:01:14.128]  But that's a side issue.
[00:01:14.148 --> 00:01:15.928]  We're going to break the whole thing down coming up.
[00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:17.469]  There is so much to cover today.
[00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:18.509]  Our troops are in the field.
[00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:25.710]  But first, a key report from John Bowne on the incredible reverse racism going on in this country.
[00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.211]  Non-whites only need apply.
[00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:36.692]  So read the casting call for Hamilton, a Broadway hit that hijacks the genius of the founding fathers and superimposes them onto minorities.
[00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:41.993]  Now being heavily scrutinized by New York civil rights attorney Randolph McLaughlin.
[00:01:42.193 --> 00:01:46.015]  What if they put an ad out that said whites only need apply?
[00:01:46.476 --> 00:01:49.418]  Why African-Americans, Latinos, Asians will be outraged.
[00:01:49.438 --> 00:01:55.321]  You cannot advertise showing that you have a preference for one racial group over another.
[00:01:55.842 --> 00:02:04.487]  As an artistic question, sure, he can cast whomever he wants to cast, but he has to give every actor eligible for the role an opportunity to try.
[00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:12.817]  Nonetheless, the cast was welcomed with open arms by the George Soros-funded Black Lives Matter crowd stumbling around the White House.
[00:02:13.057 --> 00:02:19.224]  Seven years ago, Lin-Manuel Miranda came to the White House poetry jam.
[00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:21.667]  This is definitely the room where it happened, right here.
[00:02:21.687 --> 00:02:24.571]  This is it, right here.
[00:02:25.757 --> 00:02:28.404]  I'm actually working on a hip-hop album.
[00:02:29.346 --> 00:02:34.579]  It's a concept album about the life of someone I think embodies hip-hop, Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.
[00:02:35.683 --> 00:02:37.164]  You laugh, but it's true!
[00:02:37.184 --> 00:02:40.765]  Hamilton is an amazing story that is beautifully told.
[00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:46.327]  Through Hamilton, Lin-Manuel reveals all the drama and the glory, the heartbreak that run through our nation's history.
[00:03:06.216 --> 00:03:13.809]  And he shows us that the icons in our history books were real people, with real brilliance, but also with real flaws.
[00:03:14.911 --> 00:03:18.697]  So really, Hamilton teaches us history the way it really should be taught.
[00:03:19.403 --> 00:03:24.529]  The entertainment industry's lack of creative minority roles has become par for the course.
[00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.073]  A situation Chris Rock recently brought to the fore at the Academy Awards.
[00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:39.684]  Sorority racist!
[00:03:40.304 --> 00:03:48.747]  However, diversity in American entertainment is booming in the U.S., while overseas audiences have yet to grasp the concept.
[00:03:49.087 --> 00:03:56.270]  The Hollywood Reporter writes, Sony Pictures TV casting director Don Steinberg says, it's colorblind casting.
[00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.393]  There used to be a time when it had to be written that way to look for an actor with a specific ethnicity.
[00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:04.575]  Now it's just who is the best actor for the role.
[00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:10.318]  But when trying to sell overseas, American shows are finding the color barrier is still there.
[00:04:10.638 --> 00:04:18.663]  Marion Edwards, President of International TV at Fox, says these shows are a reflection of our society, but they are not a reflection of all societies.
[00:04:19.064 --> 00:04:19.884]  Take Empire.
[00:04:20.244 --> 00:04:24.487]  Fox's hip-hop drama appeared to be a slam dunk for the international market.
[00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:27.229]  Empire has been a global flop.
[00:04:27.609 --> 00:04:35.435]  The New York City human rights law that the Broadway play Hamilton may have violated was enacted to defend against discrimination.
[00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:43.261]  The law states it is unlawful for an employer, because of the actual or perceived race of any person, to discriminate.
[00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:44.242]  Essentially,
[00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:52.491]  Entertainment supposedly aggressively tackling stereotypes has, in all of its arrogance, dug up the past.
[00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:59.178]  Basically, George Soros' Black Lives Matters movement in costume is coming to a theater near you.
[00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:01.421]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:05:09.148 --> 00:05:11.609]  Going out and protesting Islamophobia?
[00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:13.390]  Guess what you've probably been looking for.
[00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.392]  Sharia-friendly social networks for Muslims are now on the rise!
[00:05:17.592 --> 00:05:18.132]  Hooray!
[00:05:18.372 --> 00:05:20.973]  Article up by Forbes.com.
[00:05:21.173 --> 00:05:33.319]  A month ago while attending the Startup Turkey conference in Antalya, I had the chance to talk to Shoaib Faddi, CEO and co-founder of the social networking platform... Now get ready, this is the best part... MuslimFace!
[00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.200]  MuslimFace is going to be used to help combat Islamophobia.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.641]  Created by Donald Trump.
[00:05:37.821 --> 00:05:41.243]  Definitely not created by that racist title called Muslim Face.
[00:05:41.363 --> 00:05:43.964]  You look like you could probably be a member of Muslim Face.
[00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:45.425]  What gave you that idea?
[00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:47.006]  Well, you kind of look like a Muslim.
[00:05:47.126 --> 00:05:57.712]  He was there to pitch to potential investors his website, which also offers prayer times, job postings, a tool to locate your nearest mosque, and another button to help find your spouse.
[00:05:58.092 --> 00:06:02.354]  Now, it might not be seen the best of times to write about Islamic online content.
[00:06:02.494 --> 00:06:04.575]  You just named your website Muslim Face.
[00:06:04.835 --> 00:06:05.616]  Come on, man.
[00:06:05.816 --> 00:06:08.538]  You can find more reports like this at Infowars.com.
[00:06:08.838 --> 00:06:09.738]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:06:09.799 --> 00:06:10.199]  Good, brother.
[00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:12.060]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.861]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:06:14.021 --> 00:06:18.024]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:18.784]  Well, thank you, brother.
[00:06:18.804 --> 00:06:22.887]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:06:23.087 --> 00:06:31.072]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:06:31.352 --> 00:06:34.374]  We did the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:36.016]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:06:36.056 --> 00:06:38.958]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:06:38.978 --> 00:06:40.439]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:46.544]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:06:46.804 --> 00:06:48.385]  Or maximum potency.
[00:06:48.586 --> 00:06:54.750]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience.
[00:06:55.051 --> 00:06:58.734]  Whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[00:06:58.794 --> 00:07:00.535]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:07.541]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:12.573]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:12.893 --> 00:07:20.180]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable grape-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:31.371]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:39.360]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[00:07:39.641 --> 00:07:48.972]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[00:07:49.272 --> 00:07:53.493]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:07:53.733 --> 00:08:00.455]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:01.955]  That means it's clean.
[00:08:02.255 --> 00:08:03.336]  That means it's pure.
[00:08:03.396 --> 00:08:06.216]  That's infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:08:06.316 --> 00:08:08.017]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:08:10.378 --> 00:08:15.279]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:16.634 --> 00:08:20.756]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:24.417 --> 00:08:28.979]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:39.724 --> 00:08:41.004]  We're broadcasting worldwide.
[00:08:42.385 --> 00:08:47.087]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:08:47.147 --> 00:08:48.447]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:50.148 --> 00:08:53.889]  Wow, there is a lot to cover and a lot to go over today, undoubtedly.
[00:08:55.089 --> 00:09:03.032]  We have all Hades breaking loose after Donald Trump says women should be punished for illegal abortions.
[00:09:04.853 --> 00:09:05.733]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:09:08.146 --> 00:09:09.407]  Illegal abortions.
[00:09:10.627 --> 00:09:13.789]  Should someone be punished if they cut your hair without a license?
[00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:35.241]  I really don't think so, but they have laws on the books all over the country saying you've got to have a license to cut somebody's hair, a license to paint somebody's nails, a license to put cream on somebody's face, a license to give somebody a massage, and that's supposedly to protect you from back alley kooks and crazies.
[00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:37.281]  We'll end up getting you killed.
[00:09:37.341 --> 00:09:41.682]  Well, we know back alley abortions have killed tens of thousands of women.
[00:09:42.002 --> 00:09:46.444]  That's one reason they were able to get Roe v. Wade rammed through the Supreme Court in 1973.
[00:09:49.024 --> 00:09:56.846]  Was because there were a lot of back alley abortions and Trump's saying we shouldn't have back alley abortions, but he has since even backed off of that.
[00:09:59.087 --> 00:10:00.547]  Look, here's where I stand on abortion.
[00:10:01.187 --> 00:10:03.548]  I understand that a lot of women are scared.
[00:10:03.688 --> 00:10:04.128]  They're poor.
[00:10:05.728 --> 00:10:07.409]  They've already got kids in some cases.
[00:10:07.429 --> 00:10:08.450]  They don't know what to do.
[00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.152]  I don't judge those women that have gone out and had abortions.
[00:10:12.532 --> 00:10:18.056]  I don't think that they're devil worshippers or they want to hurt their kids or they're evil people.
[00:10:18.716 --> 00:10:20.618]  They've been told by the culture it's okay.
[00:10:21.238 --> 00:10:23.680]  They've been told it's the way to get out of a bad situation.
[00:10:27.342 --> 00:10:31.144]  But you've also got to think about the unborn life and stand up for that child as well.
[00:10:31.665 --> 00:10:34.967]  And that counterbalances the rights of the woman because that is a human.
[00:10:36.363 --> 00:10:45.350]  And we've devalued human life so much in this country that now they're killing old people on Don't Treat List, veterans, wounded veterans.
[00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:48.332]  They're talking about killing children up to age three.
[00:10:48.372 --> 00:10:50.594]  They're talking about killing handicapped people.
[00:10:51.035 --> 00:10:52.476]  Notice I'm politically correct.
[00:10:52.516 --> 00:10:56.599]  I'm not supposed to say handicap, but you can kill them.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:04.125]  The left, the eugenicists, are now pushing getting rid of Down's Syndrome children up to age three.
[00:11:05.862 --> 00:11:07.143]  Now don't call them retarded.
[00:11:07.704 --> 00:11:08.345]  That's mean.
[00:11:08.705 --> 00:11:10.046]  But killing them is okay.
[00:11:10.427 --> 00:11:14.651]  See how they take a real right away and then give you a phony language right?
[00:11:15.152 --> 00:11:16.393]  This is how they scramble it all.
[00:11:17.975 --> 00:11:23.541]  Don't call my grandmother, who's had polio since the 50s, or had polio, almost killed her.
[00:11:26.083 --> 00:11:27.425]  Don't call her a cripple.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:36.046]  But it's okay to give her the second round of the polio vaccine, and then one week later, she got that exact strain.
[00:11:36.667 --> 00:11:39.890]  And the doctor told her, yeah, you probably got it from the vaccine.
[00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:45.015]  She wound my grandmother for 50 plus years, 60 plus years.
[00:11:45.195 --> 00:11:46.116]  She's 90 now.
[00:11:48.118 --> 00:11:51.381]  Don't talk about the big vaccine scandal, but don't you call her a cripple.
[00:11:52.819 --> 00:11:55.020]  As if crippled is a bad word.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.641]  It's not derogative.
[00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:58.942]  They said it was derogative.
[00:11:59.582 --> 00:12:01.083]  They said it was an insult.
[00:12:01.463 --> 00:12:07.485]  They said, be nice, let us take control of language, let us tell you how to talk, call her disabled.
[00:12:11.367 --> 00:12:12.428]  Disabled.
[00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:19.471]  And then now, don't say the word mother or father, don't say the word boy or girl, say he and she.
[00:12:20.498 --> 00:12:23.058]  In public schools and colleges all over the Western world.
[00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:25.519]  And I know I've got so much news here to start off with today.
[00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:46.623]  It just shows how the people claiming they want to represent our rights, they want to protect us, they want to be the arbiters of the rule book to tell us what words we can use, have been maneuvering us towards a post-intellectual world of no communication, no information, where all debate is seen as somehow criminal and abusive and oppressive.
[00:12:48.291 --> 00:13:08.966]  That said, there's an extremely powerful video that is up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that I just tweeted out at RealAlexJones on Twitter that needs to go viral.
[00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:14.953]  Now, it's powerful audio-wise for radio listeners, but it's really powerful when it comes to the video.
[00:13:15.234 --> 00:13:16.494]  You need to see it to believe it.
[00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:18.695]  It is destined to become a meme.
[00:13:19.536 --> 00:13:27.179]  Lately, Infowars.com, unexpectedly, has been seeing some of the biggest traffic in our history from a new source.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.743]  Not Drudge Report, not our daily AM and FM audience, not Facebook, not Twitter, not YouTube.
[00:13:33.983 --> 00:13:35.083]  Those are all huge sources.
[00:13:35.123 --> 00:13:36.284]  Those are all our top sources.
[00:13:39.107 --> 00:13:39.267]  I don't
[00:14:03.473 --> 00:14:06.254]  This is something Generation X right down to Millennials is into.
[00:14:06.674 --> 00:14:10.674]  I'm aware of the big sites, Reddit and others have it, but I don't really follow it.
[00:14:11.295 --> 00:14:25.478]  And I didn't know that the last two weeks we've had most of the top memes because our listeners are going and getting clips from idiots on the show and clips from anti-Trump people and going and making memes out of them.
[00:14:25.818 --> 00:14:28.078]  And now InfoWars has many of the top memes.
[00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.278]  In fact, we should do a report on it.
[00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:32.239]  We haven't even really talked about it yet because
[00:14:33.328 --> 00:14:34.209]  It's so over the top.
[00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:43.557]  The weirdos that attack our camera people, whether it's Chicago, or whether it's Appleton, Wisconsin, or whether it's New York City or Washington, D.C.
[00:14:45.573 --> 00:14:53.259]  Run up like arrogant mentally ill cartoon characters, totally whacked out of their brains, old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:57.402]  And they say the most ridiculous stuff you've ever seen.
[00:14:57.702 --> 00:15:12.454]  And they do it with real weird, slurping, strange utterances and strange tics that are the ambrosia, the finest mother's milk.
[00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.713]  To the meme makers, who by the way are not conservative.
[00:15:17.554 --> 00:15:18.575]  They're not libertarian.
[00:15:18.615 --> 00:15:19.035]  They're not.
[00:15:19.575 --> 00:15:20.917]  They're just into entertainment.
[00:15:22.117 --> 00:15:27.020]  And I don't know how we hit the zeitgeist here, but we've now hit the zeitgeist of memes.
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.183]  I mean, sure, they've always had fun with things I do that are silly, and I certainly enjoy it.
[00:15:32.243 --> 00:15:34.444]  Please make more goofy memes of yours, truly.
[00:15:36.065 --> 00:15:36.465]  I love it.
[00:15:37.065 --> 00:15:41.188]  But these people, it is sickeningly ridiculous.
[00:15:41.948 --> 00:15:42.608]  You watch MSNBC,
[00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:55.443]  You watch CNN, all they do is tell you how intellectual and smart liberals are and how they are the most cool, avant-garde, cutting-edge philanthropists on the planet.
[00:15:56.063 --> 00:15:56.883]  Lovers of humanity.
[00:15:58.504 --> 00:16:10.106]  And when you actually go out to these events, I have never seen less light in someone's eyes, they look like they're dead, less control of language,
[00:16:11.966 --> 00:16:13.627]  More unhealthy looking people.
[00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:18.189]  They have been raised latchkey children in front of television sets.
[00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:18.789]  They're victims.
[00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:22.090]  And I shouldn't call them walnut heads and pea brains and idiots.
[00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.771]  But I'm just honest when I see something and I say it.
[00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:28.173]  I'm not on a power trip calling them totally stupid.
[00:16:28.573 --> 00:16:30.274]  I mean, I am frightened by them.
[00:16:30.914 --> 00:16:40.678]  But the reason I go one step further calling them scum of the earth is to a person they run up and try to stop other people talking to our camera men
[00:16:42.489 --> 00:16:44.892]  They run up and they try to get in our face.
[00:16:45.453 --> 00:16:47.515]  They run up and they try to stop us talking.
[00:16:47.755 --> 00:16:53.322]  There was a Hispanic lady telling a white Trump supporter, you know, you shouldn't be against illegals.
[00:16:53.382 --> 00:16:54.123]  We grow the food.
[00:16:54.163 --> 00:16:54.984]  We cook your food.
[00:16:55.585 --> 00:16:57.267]  And he says, look, lady, I grow my own food.
[00:16:57.287 --> 00:16:59.329]  He'd been talking earlier about raw milk and being a farmer.
[00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:00.471]  We were doing an interview.
[00:17:01.681 --> 00:17:03.983]  And he's like, I'm not against, in a longer interview, Hispanics.
[00:17:04.063 --> 00:17:04.864]  We've got to have a border.
[00:17:04.944 --> 00:17:05.765]  Mexico has a border.
[00:17:06.445 --> 00:17:07.486]  This is all globalism.
[00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:08.267]  It's a takeover.
[00:17:08.908 --> 00:17:11.470]  And she's sitting there talking to him, and she's not that bad of a person.
[00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.313]  She's just saying, hey, we produce, we're humans too.
[00:17:14.553 --> 00:17:15.534]  And I get that whole argument.
[00:17:15.814 --> 00:17:16.695]  It's absolutely true.
[00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:25.203]  It's the social justice warrior White Knight, I think it's a man, that runs over and says, check yourself!
[00:17:25.684 --> 00:17:27.766]  Folks, we're not joking when
[00:17:29.302 --> 00:17:29.963]  We talk about this.
[00:17:30.183 --> 00:17:36.146]  We played a bunch of videos last week where women walk over to men and say, you're not allowed to talk or videotape.
[00:17:36.446 --> 00:17:37.347]  You're a white male.
[00:17:37.667 --> 00:17:40.169]  You are surrounded by your white privilege.
[00:17:44.231 --> 00:17:45.272]  And they mean it, folks.
[00:17:45.412 --> 00:17:48.434]  They're not trying to be funny.
[00:17:48.474 --> 00:17:49.794]  They're unintentionally funny.
[00:17:49.974 --> 00:17:50.555]  But here's the deal.
[00:17:51.215 --> 00:17:55.718]  If I wasn't laughing, I'd be crying because these are dangerous pea brains.
[00:17:58.106 --> 00:18:07.754]  Conversely, I've seen the white supremacists marching in Germany, and in Sweden, and in Belgium, and they are the exact same type of people.
[00:18:07.794 --> 00:18:08.955]  They are so dumb.
[00:18:09.295 --> 00:18:10.196]  They're all drunk.
[00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:11.197]  They can hardly talk.
[00:18:11.237 --> 00:18:12.358]  They're falling down.
[00:18:12.798 --> 00:18:14.620]  They're just screaming and yelling.
[00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:16.722]  It's the same thing.
[00:18:18.123 --> 00:18:20.244]  It's culture has been dumbed down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.861]  It's been turned into just mindless tribalness.
[00:18:24.361 --> 00:18:28.923]  And I guess I've been dumbed down like idiocracy to just saying walnut, walnut, dummy, idiot, moron.
[00:18:29.184 --> 00:18:30.504]  I don't know what else I'm supposed to say.
[00:18:31.445 --> 00:18:40.789]  I watched footage the other night, about 30 minutes of different white supremacist rallies in Europe, and they were so stupid and so dumb.
[00:18:42.344 --> 00:18:43.305]  It was just unbelievable.
[00:18:43.345 --> 00:18:44.526]  And it's the same thing with these people.
[00:18:44.847 --> 00:18:46.228]  And I'm telling you, it's television.
[00:18:46.628 --> 00:18:47.849]  It's not going outside.
[00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.431]  It's being locked up all day.
[00:18:49.451 --> 00:18:52.774]  It is the fall of the human mind is what this is.
[00:18:52.994 --> 00:18:55.517]  And then all they do is boil down to the most base level.
[00:18:55.697 --> 00:19:00.762]  The problem is the globalists are using tribalism and open borders to bring people in to be tribal.
[00:19:01.142 --> 00:19:02.203]  So that has to be stopped.
[00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.232]  We brought them in to be tribal, constitutionalist, gun owners, patriots.
[00:19:06.692 --> 00:19:11.675]  I say, you know, show you can pass a test, show you know what's going on, show you want to be part of liberty.
[00:19:12.215 --> 00:19:13.216]  Bring whoever in!
[00:19:13.876 --> 00:19:14.557]  The more the merrier!
[00:19:15.097 --> 00:19:20.080]  But you can't bring in a bunch of welfare heads from the world to get even more welfare.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.662]  It's like we're competing with the world that we have more welfare than other countries.
[00:19:24.222 --> 00:19:25.783]  And here's an article that follows that today.
[00:19:26.103 --> 00:19:29.145]  Children now spend less time outside than the average prisoner.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:40.003]  That's right, they are prisoners of the system, disconnected from reality, and so scared now, if they see a Trump sign, they go into convulsions of fear.
[00:19:41.104 --> 00:19:42.084]  And that's what this is all about.
[00:19:42.104 --> 00:19:52.248]  The nanny state is about completing our journey into being absolutely broken-backed, moronic, just jellyfish.
[00:19:53.652 --> 00:19:56.894]  Cass Sunstein wants there to be a law passed at the White House.
[00:19:57.534 --> 00:20:01.016]  Regulations are, banning the promotion of sunlight is good for you.
[00:20:01.497 --> 00:20:09.081]  They want you to be cave-dwelling, thumb-sucking, mindless, cowardly, albino, bug-eyed creatures.
[00:20:09.281 --> 00:20:10.762]  Are you looking to sell body armor?

[00:21:09.105 --> 00:21:11.106]  Investments in securities involves the risk of loss.
[00:21:11.306 --> 00:21:14.266]  The following is a far too common tale of investing in annuities.
[00:21:14.426 --> 00:21:21.308]  A successful couple invested a large portion of their savings in annuities, thinking they were a safe way to guarantee a dependable income stream no matter what the market did.
[00:21:21.508 --> 00:21:23.549]  But it didn't take long for them to regret their decision.
[00:21:23.689 --> 00:21:29.871]  They were locked into low returns, faced potential tax consequences, and that they couldn't get out of their annuities without paying huge penalties.
[00:21:30.031 --> 00:21:31.611]  They were stuck, and so was their money.
[00:21:31.831 --> 00:21:34.112]  Suddenly, their retirement hopes and dreams were in danger.
[00:21:34.232 --> 00:21:35.472]  But it didn't have to happen to them.
[00:21:35.612 --> 00:21:36.872]  And it doesn't have to happen to you.
[00:21:37.092 --> 00:21:38.713]  You can avoid the annuity trap.

[00:22:38.584 --> 00:22:41.346]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:22:41.646 --> 00:22:44.268]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:22:44.288 --> 00:22:44.708]  Croix River.
[00:22:45.028 --> 00:22:47.030]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.972]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:22:50.232 --> 00:22:50.732]  His excuse?
[00:22:51.092 --> 00:22:52.173]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:22:52.433 --> 00:22:53.714]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:22:54.034 --> 00:22:59.538]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:24:21.653 --> 00:24:23.214]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:24:25.175 --> 00:24:27.237]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:24:30.979 --> 00:24:32.800]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:41.065]  By the way, just before I forget to do this, we've had, I don't know, six or seven one-of-a-kind collector's edition t-shirts.
[00:24:41.205 --> 00:24:46.389]  One of them was the Obama Joker shirt, our best seller ever, and I just said it was going to end that year and it ended.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:56.439]  But we've had so many complaints, so many people that are angry about the original Hillary for President shirt being now sold out for two or three months because we didn't produce anymore, like I said.
[00:24:57.392 --> 00:25:00.354]  That we're going to bring back the basic original design.
[00:25:00.374 --> 00:25:04.676]  As you know, Polo has designer shirts every year, but like two things are different on them.
[00:25:05.457 --> 00:25:08.098]  So the shirt you have is an original collector's edition.
[00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:11.180]  We're just going to change one thing on the front and one thing on the back.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:17.744]  We're going to change Infowars.com legalized freedom on the back from white to red on the navy blue shirt.
[00:25:18.124 --> 00:25:22.006]  And on the front, it'll say the classic election style shirt, Hillary for prison 2016.
[00:25:25.973 --> 00:25:29.056]  And something like, and forever, or until the end of time.
[00:25:29.696 --> 00:25:32.398]  That's what I decided, and until the end of time.
[00:25:32.698 --> 00:25:34.720]  Because it looks like she may be indicted any minute.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.763]  She is in deep trouble, so we need to celebrate the First Amendment.
[00:25:37.783 --> 00:25:38.663]  She tried to intimidate it.
[00:25:39.544 --> 00:25:44.888]  We are now sending that proof of that shirt off today, being made right here in America, and we will have them shipped here by next week.
[00:25:44.908 --> 00:25:47.070]  So we're going to put them up for sale tomorrow.
[00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.392]  Pre-order, but it's only a week and a half.
[00:25:49.412 --> 00:25:55.137]  You'll be waiting maximum for the original shirt, augmented, so it is a new design, technically
[00:25:55.837 --> 00:26:00.460]  It is a new addition, because I will not lie to people, but I'm just being honest that I'm almost fudging.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.803]  I feel bad doing it, but you want it, so I'm sure you're not mad at me.
[00:26:08.365 --> 00:26:10.347]  Speaking of that, look at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:26:10.387 --> 00:26:13.549]  Hillary has a date with the FBI.
[00:26:13.589 --> 00:26:14.909]  That's out of the Washington Times.
[00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:20.033]  The FBI talks Hillary while Bill trolls Obama.
[00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.951]  And they are now setting up the date.
[00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:33.317]  Do Hillary and Bill sense a breakdown in whatever deal they may have struck with President Obama to protect his presidential ambitions?
[00:26:34.778 --> 00:26:42.042]  Is whatever negotiation they may have been conducting over her email server problem and the inside information she may have had on him now imploding?
[00:26:42.523 --> 00:26:49.547]  Or have the Clintons won the negotiation with Mr. Obama, freeing them to hit him publicly to get her elected?
[00:26:51.479 --> 00:27:00.124]  And the article goes over the fact that the Clintons are now attacking Obama, just like he started two weeks ago saying that Obama, you know, has a horrible eight-year legacy.
[00:27:01.645 --> 00:27:10.051]  And now they're officially attacking him, and now the FBI officially says they're about to meet with her and will announce the date here very, very soon.
[00:27:14.213 --> 00:27:15.194]  So what's really going on?
[00:27:15.654 --> 00:27:16.255]  Meanwhile,
[00:27:17.901 --> 00:27:23.204]  Behind the facade of this innocent-looking fake Texan's cowboy hat.
[00:27:24.185 --> 00:27:26.166]  Speaking of Ted Cruz, not yours truly.
[00:27:26.426 --> 00:27:27.387]  I'm a fake Texan, too.
[00:27:27.847 --> 00:27:28.988]  Who wants to be a Texan anyway?
[00:27:29.708 --> 00:27:30.729]  I, too, am from Canada.
[00:27:31.209 --> 00:27:32.330]  By the way, nothing against Canada.
[00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.210]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.691]  I'm from Texas.
[00:27:34.791 --> 00:27:39.394]  Cruz jokes about running over Trump with his car.
[00:27:39.434 --> 00:27:44.056]  And I have the clip from Jimmy Kimmel, and it's very well deliberated out.
[00:27:44.076 --> 00:27:44.777]  We'll play it later.
[00:27:45.137 --> 00:27:46.458]  Very well thought out by Cruz.
[00:27:49.616 --> 00:27:50.597]  In fact, we'll just play it in a moment.
[00:27:51.458 --> 00:27:57.302]  And he just makes the big joke and then has a scripted Star Wars joke and CNN cut back to the clip.
[00:27:57.603 --> 00:28:00.665]  They played it this morning and just really liked Ted Cruz.
[00:28:00.705 --> 00:28:01.986]  So he's just such a darling.
[00:28:02.306 --> 00:28:04.388]  None of the Bushes have endorsed him and so much more.
[00:28:04.448 --> 00:28:10.113]  And he's funded by Goldman Sachs and the Council on Foreign Relations and helped write the TPP for Bush Sr.
[00:28:10.153 --> 00:28:10.673]  with his wife.
[00:28:10.994 --> 00:28:16.198]  He's now uncloaking as the fourth attempt by the Bushes to secure the White House.
[00:28:16.678 --> 00:28:18.019]  Now, they've done it the last three times.
[00:28:18.843 --> 00:28:21.045]  They were smart enough to know their name may have been run in the mud.
[00:28:21.646 --> 00:28:24.949]  So will there be three Cruz presidencies now?
[00:28:25.249 --> 00:28:25.829]  Let's go to the clip.
[00:28:25.849 --> 00:28:28.612]  Who do you like better, Obama or Trump?
[00:28:36.099 --> 00:28:38.661]  I dislike Obama's policies more.
[00:28:39.021 --> 00:28:39.642]  I see.
[00:28:39.702 --> 00:28:43.505]  But Donald... Donald is a unique individual.
[00:28:44.996 --> 00:29:01.781]  I will say I was watching the early part of the show and if I were in my car and getting ready to reverse and saw Donald in the backup camera, I'm not confident which pedal I'd put.
[00:29:01.981 --> 00:29:07.283]  That was given legal approval to be able to put that out.
[00:29:08.903 --> 00:29:09.823]  Legal approval.
[00:29:10.804 --> 00:29:11.264]  Guaranteed.
[00:29:12.304 --> 00:29:13.265]  So he can be ambiguous.
[00:29:13.285 --> 00:29:14.986]  Will he get a Secret Service visit for that?
[00:29:15.366 --> 00:29:29.976]  Because the New York Times writer calling for him to be killed, other people calling for him to be killed, countless musicians calling for him to be killed, movie stars calling for him to be killed, thousands of tweets, that's conservative, probably tens of thousands calling for him to be killed.
[00:29:30.836 --> 00:29:36.420]  This is an atmosphere calling for violence against Trump and Trump rallies so that his supporters
[00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:43.595]  Bernie Sanders, Hillary supporters, you name it, feel emboldened to go up and attack Donald Trump supporters.
[00:29:44.455 --> 00:29:46.557]  They're the ones pushing the climate of violence.
[00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:51.301]  They're the ones pushing the Nazi-style, brown-shirt, thugs-in-the-street agenda.
[00:29:51.321 --> 00:29:54.684]  And we've got video of that and more coming up after the break.
[00:29:54.964 --> 00:29:55.485]  Stay with us.
[00:29:55.565 --> 00:29:56.185]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:58.427 --> 00:29:59.328]  We're on the march.
[00:29:59.828 --> 00:30:01.430]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.033]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.272 --> 00:30:24.930]  As the Supreme Court wrestles with whether or not it will compel nuns to buy abortion insurance, it should be a reminder of how absurd it is to trust our liberty to nine political appointees who believe the Constitution can be amended by their opinions.
[00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:31.255]  NBC News reports that a quarter of Republican senators now want to meet with Obama's Supreme Court nominee.
[00:30:31.615 --> 00:30:36.239]  Much has been said about Obama's nominee Merrick Garland's record opposing the Second Amendment.
[00:30:36.359 --> 00:30:42.485]  What hasn't been talked about is his long record of rubber stamping any rule from any federal regulatory agency.
[00:30:42.685 --> 00:30:47.749]  Garland will be a reliable ally of the real government, the federal bureaucracies.
[00:30:48.069 --> 00:30:49.891]  With Scalia's death, the Supreme Court
[00:30:50.091 --> 00:30:54.775]  ...is expected to be deadlocked on Obama's EPA regulations to shut down the coal industry.
[00:30:55.136 --> 00:30:58.739]  The lower court, on which Garland now serves, will have the final say.
[00:30:59.379 --> 00:31:05.305]  He will take Scalia's place on this important issue, regardless of whether he takes Scalia's place on the court.
[00:31:05.765 --> 00:31:07.667]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:31:09.122 --> 00:31:09.742]  Uh, yeah.
[00:31:09.782 --> 00:31:15.545]  First of all, I want to say, Secret 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[00:31:15.605 --> 00:31:16.486]  I use them all.
[00:31:16.566 --> 00:31:17.486]  They're phenomenal.
[00:31:17.546 --> 00:31:18.026]  They work.
[00:31:18.287 --> 00:31:19.047]  Buy them, folks.
[00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:19.627]  Thank you, brother.
[00:31:19.647 --> 00:31:21.508]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[00:31:21.528 --> 00:31:27.551]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[00:31:27.751 --> 00:31:29.692]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[00:31:29.752 --> 00:31:35.155]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[00:31:35.595 --> 00:31:36.336]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[00:31:36.416 --> 00:31:40.200]  I buy all the Nutraceuticals, Pacu FX, uh, Nascent... Right!
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:40.961]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:31:41.001 --> 00:31:41.882]  Have they worked for you?
[00:31:42.042 --> 00:31:44.604]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[00:31:44.905 --> 00:31:45.946]  What products are you taking?
[00:31:45.966 --> 00:31:54.615]  Are you taking... Everything from, uh, Super Male to, uh, Brain Force to Winter Sun, uh, X2, even got a little, uh, DNA Force, so... Nice.
[00:31:54.655 --> 00:31:57.738]  And I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[00:31:57.898 --> 00:32:02.739]  Visit Infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[00:32:02.919 --> 00:32:07.541]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:32:08.881 --> 00:32:19.244]  You're investing in your health and supporting the Infowar when you visit Infowarslife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine and all the great products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:25.105]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[00:32:25.325 --> 00:32:27.386]  Iodine is key, is paramount,
[00:32:27.506 --> 00:32:32.408]  And there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[00:32:32.548 --> 00:32:41.293]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drilled down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[00:32:41.493 --> 00:32:45.215]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[00:32:45.415 --> 00:32:48.096]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[00:32:48.236 --> 00:32:52.298]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival-shield nascent iodine,
[00:32:52.438 --> 00:33:00.920]  That major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:08.101]  It is exclusive to Infowarslife.com and the Infowarslife family of incredible products.
[00:33:15.582 --> 00:33:20.383]  In the councils of government,
[00:33:20.982 --> 00:33:29.379]  We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:33:31.465 --> 00:33:34.767]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[00:33:35.207 --> 00:33:38.669]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[00:33:38.829 --> 00:33:40.970]  It's a military mission in North St.
[00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:41.350]  Louis.
[00:33:41.671 --> 00:33:43.952]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[00:33:44.232 --> 00:33:48.714]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[00:33:48.895 --> 00:33:53.397]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[00:33:53.677 --> 00:33:54.538]  Guns will be taken.
[00:33:54.578 --> 00:33:55.798]  No one will ever be armed.
[00:33:56.058 --> 00:33:56.899]  We will take all weapons.
[00:33:57.259 --> 00:33:59.582]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:33:59.622 --> 00:34:04.007]  Just really brainwashed people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:34:04.187 --> 00:34:04.488]  Enough.
[00:34:05.048 --> 00:34:05.329]  Enough.
[00:34:05.869 --> 00:34:06.150]  Enough.
[00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:07.131]  Enough.
[00:34:07.291 --> 00:34:11.776]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[00:34:11.856 --> 00:34:15.821]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[00:34:16.201 --> 00:34:22.365]  NSKS Late News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[00:34:23.066 --> 00:34:23.206]  Us.
[00:34:23.386 --> 00:34:31.291]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:34:31.411 --> 00:34:34.013]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:34:35.014 --> 00:34:36.595]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:34:37.452 --> 00:34:43.438]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:48.383]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[00:34:48.704 --> 00:34:53.369]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[00:35:01.112 --> 00:35:06.134]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[00:35:06.474 --> 00:35:07.655]  You're in your apartment!
[00:35:07.775 --> 00:35:08.895]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[00:35:08.915 --> 00:35:09.996]  Go back inside right now!
[00:35:10.116 --> 00:35:10.856]  I am inside.
[00:35:10.876 --> 00:35:12.216]  I have two words for you.
[00:35:13.057 --> 00:35:13.897]  Predator groans.
[00:35:14.878 --> 00:35:15.878]  You will never see it coming.
[00:35:19.918 --> 00:35:22.380]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:31.947]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[00:35:32.047 --> 00:35:37.271]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[00:35:37.491 --> 00:35:42.255]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[00:35:42.555 --> 00:35:44.597]  If you want them, come and take them!
[00:35:46.335 --> 00:35:47.656]  We are on the march.
[00:35:47.817 --> 00:35:50.579]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:55.624]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:36:10.299 --> 00:36:15.482]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist.
[00:36:16.142 --> 00:36:19.424]  This is the heart of 1776!
[00:36:21.625 --> 00:36:29.529]  America, for all its problems, is what is left of the Renaissance, what is left of the Magna Carta, what is left of the spirit of 1776.
[00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:31.310]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:36:33.308 --> 00:36:37.802]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, already the 31st day of March, 2016.
[00:36:43.897 --> 00:37:00.053]  Senators and members of the 9-11 Commission as well as the Congressional Commission have gone public that have seen the 28 pages and said that it shows an order for NORAD and the Pentagon to stand down on 9-11 and that the FBI had been ordered to stand down when wanting to go after the hijackers.
[00:37:00.533 --> 00:37:02.455]  That all came out in the news at the time.
[00:37:02.475 --> 00:37:03.917]  The FBI agents from
[00:37:05.228 --> 00:37:11.971]  Illinois and Minnesota and Arizona and Texas and Florida and California all went public.
[00:37:12.532 --> 00:37:13.672]  Many of them got demoted.
[00:37:14.052 --> 00:37:21.916]  Many of them got in trouble instead of getting medals and said that they were ordered to stand down.
[00:37:21.956 --> 00:37:30.100]  Well, the specifics Congress learned and the Intelligence Committee learned in closed session, they were ordered to stand down six months before 9-11 right through 9-11.
[00:37:33.424 --> 00:37:59.682]  Now you notice a few months before 9-11, Chris Carter on the Lone Gunman, a spinoff of X-Files, aired an episode that the CIA had approached him on, The Talking Points, where a criminal element in the government hijacks a passenger jet by remote control to fly it into the World Trade Center to blame it on Afghanistan, start a worldwide war, and set up a police state in America.
[00:38:00.686 --> 00:38:08.729]  NORAD's ordered to stand down in the TV show because they're told it's a terrorism drill, not a real hijacking.
[00:38:09.129 --> 00:38:12.231]  That happened a few months later on 9-11.
[00:38:12.571 --> 00:38:15.492]  We all wondered why it was in the piece.
[00:38:18.493 --> 00:38:26.456]  We've basically confirmed it was a warning leaked through and still the criminal elements didn't care that it had been put out on television.
[00:38:26.977 --> 00:38:27.917]  They went ahead with it.
[00:38:29.901 --> 00:38:34.645]  I was always saying, revelation of the method, throwing it in our face, preparing us, but now I've tracked it back.
[00:38:34.665 --> 00:38:35.586]  I'm going to just stop there.
[00:38:35.866 --> 00:38:37.067]  Later I'll be able to bring all this out.
[00:38:37.527 --> 00:38:38.668]  Super dangerous, obviously.
[00:38:39.509 --> 00:38:40.870]  Not so much for me, but other people.
[00:38:44.153 --> 00:38:46.995]  That that's why there were warnings to the FBI and the CIA.
[00:38:47.095 --> 00:38:49.637]  Most people in the government don't want to be part of stuff like this.
[00:38:49.697 --> 00:38:50.838]  It's highly compartmentalized.
[00:38:51.238 --> 00:38:52.479]  Criminal elements did it.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.202]  That's why the government in general is not our enemy.
[00:38:56.175 --> 00:39:01.959]  Now I'll be honest with you, 15 years ago I wasn't sophisticated enough or didn't have enough time to figure out what this stuff was.
[00:39:02.359 --> 00:39:07.102]  I just said, there's no way they had a plot of a show that's exactly what Fitz happened in reality.
[00:39:10.104 --> 00:39:10.664]  Well now we know.
[00:39:10.684 --> 00:39:14.366]  It's amazing.
[00:39:16.047 --> 00:39:16.708]  It's sensational.
[00:39:17.836 --> 00:39:18.416]  It's incredible.
[00:39:18.937 --> 00:39:19.457]  And it's real.
[00:39:20.318 --> 00:39:21.298]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:23.600]  I want to get into the over-the-top China news.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:24.681]  Over-the-top.
[00:39:25.101 --> 00:39:26.562]  Over-the-top attacks on free speech.
[00:39:26.782 --> 00:39:28.804]  Over-the-top police state activity.
[00:39:30.405 --> 00:39:38.650]  The University of North Carolina Diversity Workshop brands... Band-Aids as white privilege.
[00:39:40.912 --> 00:39:43.474]  Yeah, that's what Melissa Harris Perry would teach on MSNBC.
[00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:43.714]  That...
[00:39:46.027 --> 00:39:47.448]  Hot water is white privilege.
[00:39:47.508 --> 00:39:49.629]  That clothing is white privilege.
[00:39:49.749 --> 00:39:49.929]  What?
[00:39:49.949 --> 00:39:53.151]  Do you have any idea how many whites have been slaves in history?
[00:39:53.452 --> 00:39:54.192]  Or have been homeless?
[00:39:54.252 --> 00:39:55.373]  I mean, I'm just tired of it.
[00:39:55.413 --> 00:40:05.459]  It's this myth that, like, I have rocket boosters on me like Iron Man when I get up in the morning and I... Now fly around.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.001]  I don't get diseases, I don't get sick.
[00:40:09.021 --> 00:40:10.601]  What was the latest thing Bernie Sanders said?
[00:40:11.281 --> 00:40:16.582]  White people, white people, white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:40:22.364 --> 00:40:24.885]  What is it, something like 18% of white people are below the poverty line?
[00:40:27.585 --> 00:40:30.386]  We drove around, Joe Biggs did, we found quite a few poor white people.
[00:40:33.459 --> 00:40:35.019]  And we talked to so-called minorities.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.860]  I say that because in most areas, minorities are the majority.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.661]  And they couldn't believe it.
[00:40:39.681 --> 00:40:40.601]  They said, that's pure bull.
[00:40:41.621 --> 00:40:44.002]  So, this is this idea.
[00:40:44.042 --> 00:40:44.983]  Let me give everybody a newsflash.
[00:40:45.163 --> 00:40:48.023]  All our kids are getting bombarded by television, having their brains rewired.
[00:40:48.204 --> 00:40:49.584]  All our kids are getting hit with fluoride.
[00:40:49.764 --> 00:40:51.545]  All our kids are having deadly vaccines pointed at them.
[00:40:51.925 --> 00:40:57.046]  All our kids are having GMO shoved at them, and dyes, and chemicals, and MSG, and aspartame.
[00:40:57.386 --> 00:40:59.347]  We're all under globalist attack.
[00:41:01.186 --> 00:41:04.489]  They just want us fighting with each other, so we're not aware of that, but I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:41:04.509 --> 00:41:13.456]  It's like that movie, The Kingsman, where they put a wavelength program out via all the smartphones and TVs to make everybody kill each other.
[00:41:13.957 --> 00:41:16.799]  That's a dumbed-down allegory of what they're actually doing.
[00:41:19.781 --> 00:41:25.246]  Literally, through flicker rates of the TV, but then a bunch of other cultural brainwashing, and the rest of it.
[00:41:27.063 --> 00:41:30.905]  Remember, Pokemon, 15 years ago, made tens of thousands of kids in Japan and the U.S.
[00:41:30.945 --> 00:41:33.486]  have convulsions, fall and bust their heads open.
[00:41:33.766 --> 00:41:38.669]  Some of them died with flashing lights and a certain rhythm.
[00:41:38.909 --> 00:41:49.334]  Folks, you can go to UT Psychology Department, go right in there of your student, a PhD level, go right into DARPA-funded areas, and that's literally what they're obsessed with.
[00:41:49.354 --> 00:41:53.916]  They have got flicker rates that'll make a grown man in about 30 seconds fall down on the ground.
[00:41:59.189 --> 00:41:59.629]  That's a fact.
[00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:02.251]  They can knock you out.
[00:42:02.751 --> 00:42:04.372]  But they don't want it to be too obvious.
[00:42:04.392 --> 00:42:08.134]  They want to just slowly test it, slowly find ways.
[00:42:08.914 --> 00:42:11.316]  You ask why the public seems to be in a mindless trance.
[00:42:12.917 --> 00:42:16.659]  They're in highly suggestible, near-sleep, sleepwalking trances.
[00:42:17.039 --> 00:42:20.941]  They're jellyfish that watch TV and play video games up to 10 hours a day.
[00:42:21.001 --> 00:42:22.722]  They don't want to be told they shouldn't do that.
[00:42:22.962 --> 00:42:26.745]  They have hypnotic suggestions planted to get angry if you warn them.
[00:42:26.785 --> 00:42:27.325]  They're addicted.
[00:42:29.602 --> 00:42:51.872]  They live in a false world and then they're only activated by having to go to work or school or whatever and by messages in TV of when it's time to go zombie attack Donald Trump racist Donald Trump hateful must get him must kill him and that's the messages from Trump and the New York the Trump haters like Cruz and
[00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:56.072]  The New York Times and all other publications saying, somebody kill him!
[00:42:56.392 --> 00:42:56.912]  Kill him!
[00:42:57.192 --> 00:42:57.652]  Kill him!
[00:42:58.173 --> 00:43:01.474]  How dare his people attack the loving protesters who are actually attacking?
[00:43:01.974 --> 00:43:03.195]  They're legitimizing it all.
[00:43:05.556 --> 00:43:07.517]  What's the movie?
[00:43:07.557 --> 00:43:08.438]  Is it Major League 2?
[00:43:09.878 --> 00:43:11.499]  Or is it Naked Gun 2 or 3?
[00:43:11.679 --> 00:43:12.199]  I forget.
[00:43:12.279 --> 00:43:17.402]  I was surfing through cable like six months ago and saw one with the Naked Gun actor.
[00:43:19.224 --> 00:43:20.104]  And is it O.J.
[00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:20.624]  Simpson?
[00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:22.085]  Must kill?
[00:43:22.945 --> 00:43:24.385]  Guys, go to YouTube and type in O.J.
[00:43:24.425 --> 00:43:24.845]  Simpson.
[00:43:25.726 --> 00:43:26.686]  No, no, it's not O.J.
[00:43:26.726 --> 00:43:27.086]  Simpson.
[00:43:27.286 --> 00:43:28.546]  He's another one saying must kill.
[00:43:28.626 --> 00:43:30.207]  It's, uh, Strawberry.
[00:43:30.767 --> 00:43:31.607]  Famous baseball player.
[00:43:32.367 --> 00:43:34.868]  And then he's gotta kill Drebin.
[00:43:34.888 --> 00:43:36.068]  I think that's the name of the detective.
[00:43:37.429 --> 00:43:39.229]  It's about like that, except it's not as 100%.
[00:43:39.289 --> 00:43:41.810]  Like Sirhan Sirhan.
[00:43:43.752 --> 00:43:44.452]  Was drugged.
[00:43:44.612 --> 00:43:45.293]  He was drooling.
[00:43:45.313 --> 00:43:46.633]  The police said he shot the ground.
[00:43:46.653 --> 00:43:47.494]  His hand was held down.
[00:43:47.814 --> 00:43:52.696]  We know the guy behind him, CIA from the Skunk Works, a base nearby that shot him in the back.
[00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:53.957]  That's all come out.
[00:43:54.057 --> 00:43:55.238]  It's in the LAPD report.
[00:43:57.279 --> 00:44:01.841]  But instead of being total mind control, it's a highly suggestible population.
[00:44:02.221 --> 00:44:02.621]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:44:02.681 --> 00:44:04.102]  Naked Gun, Reggie Jackson.
[00:44:04.322 --> 00:44:05.202]  Folks, I don't follow.
[00:44:05.723 --> 00:44:06.843]  I don't follow baseball.
[00:44:06.903 --> 00:44:08.404]  I just knew it was a famous baseball player.
[00:44:12.881 --> 00:44:14.082]  So we can try to queue that up.
[00:44:14.142 --> 00:44:15.643]  I want to show that because that's hilarious.
[00:44:16.283 --> 00:44:18.465]  Until you understand, you make it suggestible.
[00:44:18.945 --> 00:44:23.448]  You go on mainstream television and say it's legitimate to kill XYZ.
[00:44:23.669 --> 00:44:24.749]  He deserves to be killed.
[00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:26.811]  And you've got tens of millions of viewers.
[00:44:27.191 --> 00:44:32.795]  There's a good chance one of those people, when you're having a public rally, is going to take a shot at you or try to kill you.
[00:44:35.856 --> 00:44:41.280]  And so it's basically like the mafia saying, who's going to take care of this problem for me?
[00:44:41.641 --> 00:44:44.283]  You're not giving the order for somebody to be killed, you're just doing it.
[00:44:44.523 --> 00:44:48.846]  Now let me stop and get into this news, because I'm kind of digressing here.
[00:44:50.508 --> 00:45:02.157]  First off, the good news is we're selling a lot of Vitamin Mineral Fusion, the latest product at Infowarslife.com, because the vitamin folks, the people that are into nutraceuticals, that are into supplements, can go read about it and see what a high quality product it is.
[00:45:03.527 --> 00:45:05.007]  The bad news is we had a limited run.
[00:45:05.307 --> 00:45:06.628]  It took us two years to develop this.
[00:45:06.968 --> 00:45:08.868]  It'll probably be a month till more of this comes in.
[00:45:08.888 --> 00:45:17.270]  So I would guess it'll be sold out by next Monday or Tuesday at current sales rates.
[00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:19.831]  It has 80 plus vitamins and minerals in it.
[00:45:19.911 --> 00:45:24.152]  It's got a whole bunch of different coenzyme Q10.
[00:45:24.632 --> 00:45:25.632]  It just goes on and on.
[00:45:27.037 --> 00:45:30.699]  Alpha lipoic acid, boron, glycine.
[00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:32.840]  I'm not going to go over everything that's in this.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.561]  It's got a bunch of amino acids, so your body actually absorbs it.
[00:45:35.621 --> 00:45:36.222]  It's excellent.
[00:45:37.482 --> 00:45:43.125]  And it can be taken with other multivitamin and mineral drinks as well.
[00:45:43.145 --> 00:45:47.127]  There's a lot of other great brands out there, like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, we sell them for us.
[00:45:47.407 --> 00:45:48.908]  Health.com, it's excellent.
[00:45:49.668 --> 00:45:51.489]  This is one, though, that's plant-derived.
[00:45:51.649 --> 00:45:52.750]  Ours is plant-derived.
[00:45:54.131 --> 00:46:05.539]  Uh, and we have put this together to even make the food Nazis, the vitamin Nazis, not the soup Nazi, who are super obsessed with having the, just the ultimate purity, the ultimate, you know, not having anything artificial in it.
[00:46:05.759 --> 00:46:06.880]  It's very hard to do that.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.501]  This has it.
[00:46:08.641 --> 00:46:09.662]  It is a game changer.
[00:46:10.022 --> 00:46:11.903]  Infowarslife.com.

[00:46:39.668 --> 00:46:44.170]  At AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:46.931]  Secret 12s, super high quality bottom B12s back in stock.
[00:46:47.451 --> 00:46:48.812]  Super Metal Vitality is back in stock.
[00:46:48.872 --> 00:46:50.092]  Anthroplex is back in stock.
[00:46:50.552 --> 00:46:53.233]  InfoWarsStore.com is the big blanket main site.
[00:46:53.814 --> 00:46:57.095]  InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the sub-directory area.
[00:46:57.495 --> 00:46:59.716]  Where you can find that for yourself.
[00:47:00.296 --> 00:47:02.536]  But the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, let me know what you think about it.
[00:47:02.996 --> 00:47:04.637]  In fact, it's so good, my mouth is watering.
[00:47:04.997 --> 00:47:07.217]  I keep getting busy during the breaks, working on news.
[00:47:07.497 --> 00:47:16.919]  Well, one of the great crew, one of the great interns or whoever, can I have one scoop of this ice cubes and some of that ProPure filtered water, please?
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.660]  Because I actually started...
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.941]  I'm not kidding, it was involuntary.
[00:47:21.341 --> 00:47:31.346]  This is the best tasting fruit punch, because when it's sugary fruit punch, there's something weird about it, even though it tastes good, or when it's stuffed with other artificial flavors that might even be not bad for you, it still just has some weird taste.
[00:47:31.926 --> 00:47:38.069]  This is so game-changing, there's so many permutations of it, that it's naturally
[00:47:39.412 --> 00:47:49.015]  Sweetened by just what's in it, like a thousand daily intake of vitamin C, and it's the actual, you know, organic form of vitamin C, which itself tastes good.
[00:47:49.035 --> 00:47:52.256]  I mean, it's just it's it's flavored by the vitamins and minerals that are in it.
[00:47:52.796 --> 00:47:53.316]  It's crazy.
[00:47:53.656 --> 00:47:54.437]  My mouth is watering.
[00:47:55.017 --> 00:47:55.897]  That is not a pitch.
[00:47:55.937 --> 00:47:56.477]  It was watering.
[00:47:56.537 --> 00:47:58.098]  I said, why not just be honest about it?
[00:47:58.778 --> 00:48:00.000]  Wait till you taste this.
[00:48:00.721 --> 00:48:09.172]  My only problem is, it's so super neurotic, so clean, so good, the best sources, to get all these ingredients together to be able to do a run was hard.
[00:48:09.592 --> 00:48:14.238]  We finally, three months ago, four months ago actually, green-lighted the final formulation.
[00:48:14.619 --> 00:48:16.862]  It took a couple months just to get the ingredients.
[00:48:18.086 --> 00:48:25.650]  And that's why big companies that even have, you know, quality stuff still isn't to this level because they wouldn't be able to operate on a mass scale.
[00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:33.074]  That's our problem is it's almost becoming boutique nutraceuticals because sometimes we can't get what we were getting.
[00:48:33.094 --> 00:48:35.135]  We have to change the formulation and then make that announcement.
[00:48:35.736 --> 00:48:39.838]  That's why we've changed super male twice, super female twice.
[00:48:40.638 --> 00:48:41.699]  Uh, we had to change, uh,
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.661]  We had to change the deep cleanse.
[00:48:45.082 --> 00:48:47.804]  What was it, from Himalayan Shilajit to Russian Shilajit?
[00:48:47.824 --> 00:48:52.208]  It's the same mountain ranges, but we couldn't put it out for like six months because we couldn't get it.
[00:48:52.569 --> 00:48:53.369]  Anyways, I'm digressing.
[00:48:53.389 --> 00:48:54.050]  I have news to cover.
[00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:54.751]  I apologize.
[00:48:55.191 --> 00:48:59.675]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, get yours today.
[00:48:59.695 --> 00:49:01.357]  That funds the broadcast, so that's good news.
[00:49:01.657 --> 00:49:03.699]  Please support our local affiliates and sponsors as well.
[00:49:04.099 --> 00:49:08.864]  Become a local sponsor of local stations, or support those sponsors, or send a hundred bucks to your local station.
[00:49:09.966 --> 00:49:18.493]  I can't tell you how many stations we're on when we start out on the weekend with a Sunday show to put their toe in the water, and within six months we're on at night, and then within a year we're on during the day live.
[00:49:18.993 --> 00:49:26.940]  That's because we get good ratings, a lot of folks tune in to support, get great ratings, top ratings in many cases, but also the support comes through.
[00:49:27.708 --> 00:49:34.629]  A lot of times after that $1,500 bill or $20 bill comes in to a station manager, thank him, they go, that Alex Jones, what are his ratings?
[00:49:34.649 --> 00:49:36.910]  Yeah, they've gone up on Sundays, turning three months.
[00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:38.330]  Put him on weeknights.
[00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:40.351]  Then a few months later, that does well.
[00:49:40.371 --> 00:49:43.891]  All right, let's give him an hour live, the rest at night.
[00:49:43.911 --> 00:49:47.092]  And then after a few months, all three hours, all four hours live.
[00:49:47.112 --> 00:49:48.633]  It's happening all over the country.
[00:49:49.233 --> 00:49:50.133]  Then the station sells.
[00:49:51.095 --> 00:49:51.995]  Or it changes format.
[00:49:52.775 --> 00:49:55.656]  And that's, you know, we get up to like 200 affiliates and it always goes back down.
[00:49:55.896 --> 00:49:57.676]  We've never gotten above 200 affiliates.
[00:49:57.776 --> 00:49:58.777]  It's like 180 something right now.
[00:49:59.797 --> 00:50:02.377]  They're always changing and that's just the way talk radio is.
[00:50:02.457 --> 00:50:06.058]  But, and we're not part of a big, there's two big companies that have a duopoly.
[00:50:06.838 --> 00:50:08.439]  Or an oligopoly, would probably be the better term.
[00:50:08.459 --> 00:50:11.679]  There's three companies total, but two of them have like 90% of the stations.
[00:50:12.219 --> 00:50:20.061]  There's thousands and thousands of radio stations in the country, but only a few hundred that could pick this show up and be independent, and they're the ones doing it.
[00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.484]  Actually, hats off to Clear Channel.
[00:50:22.505 --> 00:50:33.628]  They put me just out of a business decision eight years ago on XM, and it got top sign-ups, made them a lot of money, had a lot of listeners, and we shared the advertising with them.
[00:50:33.648 --> 00:50:35.329]  Just executives, free market, wanted to make money.
[00:50:35.729 --> 00:50:46.153]  Plus, I was told those guys were Libertarians, and then there was a merger happened, Goldman Sachs came in, and I was thrown off with over 200 other Libertarian Patriot hosts.
[00:50:47.338 --> 00:50:51.203]  So, I said, didn't matter it was successful, didn't matter you tuned in.
[00:50:51.223 --> 00:50:53.626]  I mean, they're doing everything they can to shut us off, folks.
[00:50:55.207 --> 00:50:55.888]  Everything they can.
[00:50:55.908 --> 00:51:03.217]  I mean, I'll admit, Clerk Channel has actually put us on a few stations they manage and things just because we get high, high ratings, but not anymore.
[00:51:03.257 --> 00:51:03.958]  That's all changed.
[00:51:03.978 --> 00:51:06.301]  There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes.
[00:51:09.045 --> 00:51:10.245]  You know about RVs.
[00:51:10.446 --> 00:51:11.686]  You've heard about bunkers.
[00:51:11.906 --> 00:51:14.447]  But surviving is not recreation.
[00:51:14.647 --> 00:51:17.168]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[00:53:08.024 --> 00:53:11.506]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:53:12.246 --> 00:53:12.747]  It's true.
[00:53:12.867 --> 00:53:16.809]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:53:17.029 --> 00:53:18.870]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:23.893]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[00:54:35.223 --> 00:54:38.605]  I'm like a bear trying to get into that bottom of mineral fusion.
[00:54:39.445 --> 00:54:40.585]  No plug intended.
[00:54:41.546 --> 00:54:45.508]  I've got such bad arthritis in this right hand from all the times I've broken my fist.
[00:54:45.608 --> 00:54:48.369]  I'm like an old man now trying to get in that container.
[00:54:49.724 --> 00:54:54.006]  My son will want to box and stuff, and like accidentally punch into my fist when we're shadowboxing, and it's like, ah!
[00:54:55.307 --> 00:54:59.149]  I tell you, getting old is interesting.
[00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:05.453]  And I'm not that old, I'm 42, but I tell you, I tell you, I can't imagine what it's like for my 80-year-old grandmother with arthritis.
[00:55:05.993 --> 00:55:09.795]  What that must feel like, because I've got to get reconstructive surgery, the doctors told me, on three knuckles.
[00:55:10.315 --> 00:55:14.978]  The knuckles are completely collapsed and gone, and the tendons now go basically up underneath each other.
[00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.759]  So I'm not whining, I'm not complaining.
[00:55:17.139 --> 00:55:21.981]  I need to start taking the InfoWarsLife.com joint and bone formula, because I'm told it really helps.
[00:55:22.462 --> 00:55:24.943]  I'm just not in the mode of taking all these pills.
[00:55:25.463 --> 00:55:28.365]  But everything else I've taken ends up helping, so I need to do that.
[00:55:28.845 --> 00:55:32.207]  Didn't mean to do a plug right there for InfoWarsLife.com, but I just did it.
[00:55:34.048 --> 00:55:44.077]  All right, let me get into the news that's coming up after Congressman Walter Jones, currently of North Carolina, joins us for the first 30 minutes.
[00:55:44.838 --> 00:55:54.747]  In the second half of the transmission, I'm going to open the phones up and play tons of clips and get into all of the other news because there is so much of it.
[00:55:55.908 --> 00:55:57.309]  The political correctness is kind of
[00:55:58.487 --> 00:56:00.428]  Really going to a new level right now.
[00:56:00.468 --> 00:56:03.790]  Again, wanting to say that band-aids are part of white privilege.
[00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:04.391]  I'm not kidding.
[00:56:04.411 --> 00:56:04.991]  That's coming up.
[00:56:05.011 --> 00:56:07.072]  That's being taught in colleges right now.
[00:56:07.613 --> 00:56:08.673]  You don't pay to go to college.
[00:56:08.693 --> 00:56:11.415]  You don't pay for your children to go to college so they actually get a job.
[00:56:11.455 --> 00:56:17.098]  You pay to go lose them and have them further indoctrinated by the system.
[00:56:18.359 --> 00:56:22.842]  We're also going to play the video, Meet the Dumb Bleepers Who Hate Trump.
[00:56:23.282 --> 00:56:25.704]  And they try to come over and stop people's free speech.
[00:56:27.321 --> 00:56:29.362]  When they try to talk to the media.
[00:56:30.743 --> 00:56:33.805]  Because they're so incredibly liberal and so incredibly cool.
[00:56:34.745 --> 00:56:36.746]  We're also going to get into the heart of the problem.
[00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:39.968]  Children now spend less time outside than the average prisoner.
[00:56:41.629 --> 00:56:43.170]  Also, this ties into Donald Trump.
[00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:43.771]  We have the clip here.
[00:56:43.791 --> 00:56:48.893]  We're going to play it in just a moment of Trump on punishing women that quote, get illegal abortions.
[00:56:49.334 --> 00:56:53.196]  FDA authorizes expanded use of medical abortion pill.
[00:56:55.177 --> 00:56:56.478]  But first, let's go to the clip.
[00:56:57.902 --> 00:57:01.248]  of Trump that they're saying is the biggest faux pas yet.
[00:57:01.768 --> 00:57:03.511]  Every faux pas only made him more popular.
[00:57:04.012 --> 00:57:05.855]  Saying women should be punished for illegal abortions.
[00:57:05.875 --> 00:57:06.215]  Here it is.
[00:57:08.048 --> 00:57:09.889]  Should the woman be punished for having an abortion?
[00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:13.251]  This is not something you can dodge.
[00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:18.194]  If you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder, you have to deal with it under the law.
[00:57:18.574 --> 00:57:19.855]  Should abortion be punished?
[00:57:20.135 --> 00:57:26.779]  Well, people in certain parts of the Republican Party and conservative Republicans would say yes, they should be punished.
[00:57:26.799 --> 00:57:27.499]  How about you?
[00:57:27.619 --> 00:57:30.241]  I would say that it's a very serious problem.
[00:57:30.481 --> 00:57:30.922]  I don't know.
[00:57:55.285 --> 00:57:56.986]  Somebody who flunked out of medical school.
[00:57:57.066 --> 00:57:57.527]  Are you Catholic?
[00:57:57.567 --> 00:57:58.187]  Yes, I think.
[00:57:58.387 --> 00:58:00.749]  And how do you feel about the Catholic Church's position?
[00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:03.851]  I accept the teaching authority of my church on moral issues.
[00:58:03.871 --> 00:58:05.852]  But do you know their position on abortion?
[00:58:05.912 --> 00:58:06.393]  Yes, I do.
[00:58:06.493 --> 00:58:08.314]  And do you concur with that position?
[00:58:08.534 --> 00:58:09.895]  I concur with their moral position.
[00:58:09.915 --> 00:58:11.236]  But legally, I get to the question.
[00:58:11.276 --> 00:58:12.117]  Here's my problem.
[00:58:12.137 --> 00:58:12.957]  No, no, but let me ask you.
[00:58:13.017 --> 00:58:14.678]  But what do you say about- It's not funny.
[00:58:14.718 --> 00:58:15.219]  Your church.
[00:58:15.359 --> 00:58:16.480]  Yeah, it's really not a funny thing.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:17.981]  What do you say about your church?
[00:58:18.001 --> 00:58:19.482]  They're very, very strong.
[00:58:19.502 --> 00:58:21.183]  But the churches make their moral decisions.
[00:58:21.223 --> 00:58:24.185]  But you running for president of the United States will be chief executive of the United States.
[00:58:26.522 --> 00:58:28.143]  And so all he says is we have to look at it.
[00:58:28.183 --> 00:58:29.984]  They turn that into he wants to put women in prison.
[00:58:30.304 --> 00:58:31.525]  Very reasonable answer.
[00:58:32.285 --> 00:58:32.946]  Unscripted.
[00:58:33.146 --> 00:58:34.106]  That's what you want.
[00:58:34.606 --> 00:58:36.007]  That's not controversial at all.
[00:58:36.367 --> 00:58:44.092]  If we're gonna ban it again, like it is in so many other countries, then there will probably be some type of punishment for going and getting an illegal abortion.
[00:58:44.312 --> 00:58:47.153]  The truth is women will just go to Canada or other countries.
[00:58:47.594 --> 00:58:49.234]  But the point is this is about eugenics.
[00:58:49.855 --> 00:58:51.356]  It's not about abortion, folks.
[00:58:52.277 --> 00:58:53.884]  And plus Trump's not even going there.
[00:58:53.904 --> 00:58:55.049]  Stay with us.
[00:58:58.908 --> 00:59:02.130]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:10.454]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:10.674 --> 00:59:15.697]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:00:01.514 --> 01:00:04.120]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:25.769]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:37.521]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:37.581 --> 01:00:38.662]  Man, I'm a goofball.
[01:00:40.439 --> 01:00:43.602]  We brought TV originally to radio about 18 years ago.
[01:00:44.523 --> 01:00:47.105]  Drudge kind of gives me dibs on that, and he's right.
[01:00:47.366 --> 01:00:48.627]  We have Trailblaze on that front.
[01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:49.448]  It's fun to trailblaze.
[01:00:50.088 --> 01:00:55.613]  But we're now pretty much a TV production, but with talk radio style on the radio and on television.
[01:00:56.254 --> 01:01:02.860]  But during the break, I was actually mixing some of the new flagship product, ThenForgedLife.com Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:05.162]  Fruit punch drink.
[01:01:05.722 --> 01:01:12.345]  One little tiny scooper because it's so concentrated into a whole glass of water and it's almost too sweet and almost too strong for me.
[01:01:12.845 --> 01:01:13.985]  But I just love the flavor.
[01:01:14.525 --> 01:01:16.186]  That's why this stuff is so incredible.
[01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:17.347]  It's gonna be such a game-changer.
[01:01:17.687 --> 01:01:19.507]  No reviews yet because it just came out yesterday.
[01:01:19.828 --> 01:01:20.688]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:01:20.708 --> 01:01:22.289]  I'm gonna stop plugging.
[01:01:22.329 --> 01:01:25.410]  I was just describing for TV viewers during the break.
[01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:30.832]  I actually just took over and was talking during the break and mixing some of this because it's so amazing.
[01:01:33.288 --> 01:01:34.549]  By the way, there's no reason to even plug it.
[01:01:34.569 --> 01:01:35.869]  It's going to sell out by next week.
[01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:45.814]  But I am excited about the product, because as soon as we're able to get enough of it mass-produced, I think it's going to be a game-changer and may actually help fund us to the next level and take on the globalists.
[01:01:46.495 --> 01:01:53.458]  And then I won't have to beat my brains out trying to raise money to fund this operation, like I know local station owners have to do as well.
[01:01:54.699 --> 01:01:56.299]  Most newspapers are bankrupt.
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:01.182]  They've been bought by foreign interests to just influence, peddle, and engage in political disinformation.
[01:02:02.582 --> 01:02:10.289]  Foreign leaders, Mexican kingpins, Russian kingpins, Chinese kingpins, EU kingpins, that's in the news.
[01:02:10.949 --> 01:02:15.433]  We are such a joke when Donald Trump talks about foreign interests coming in and taking over.
[01:02:16.473 --> 01:02:24.880]  That's why we, the people, have to go out and support independent, liberty-based media that will tell the truth, even if you don't agree with all of it.
[01:02:28.168 --> 01:02:31.090]  I agree with maybe 20% of what Donald Trump has to say.
[01:02:31.811 --> 01:02:33.152]  But I like his brashness.
[01:02:33.252 --> 01:02:36.014]  I like his political incorrectness.
[01:02:36.154 --> 01:02:37.676]  I like his nationalism.
[01:02:37.836 --> 01:02:41.259]  I like what he's doing when it comes to sovereignty.
[01:02:41.799 --> 01:02:42.840]  He's a nationalist.
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:43.641]  They're globalists.
[01:02:44.001 --> 01:02:44.781]  He's the answer.
[01:02:46.583 --> 01:02:47.504]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:02:47.544 --> 01:02:51.107]  They say if you throw a vampire in a big fire, they'll catch on fire and burn up.
[01:02:52.028 --> 01:02:53.748]  Now, I don't want to stick my arm in the fire.
[01:02:54.269 --> 01:03:02.811]  I don't agree with everything the fire's doing, but I do want to throw the globalist onto the big burning pit of coals and 50-foot flames shooting up that is Donald Trump.
[01:03:03.511 --> 01:03:08.653]  He's kind of like the oven, you know, that Hansel and Gretel trick the witch on going in, and they close the door, and you know what I mean?
[01:03:09.533 --> 01:03:13.174]  So, Trump... Man, I come up with some weird analogies off the top of my head.
[01:03:13.234 --> 01:03:15.535]  Some of them are really stupid, but whatever!
[01:03:15.795 --> 01:03:18.135]  The point is, is there you go.
[01:03:19.096 --> 01:03:19.916]  That's what's going on.
[01:03:21.274 --> 01:03:25.717]  We have Congressman Walter Jones coming on with very, very serious information on multi-fronts.
[01:03:25.737 --> 01:03:27.218]  The latest on the 28 pages.
[01:03:27.238 --> 01:03:30.380]  The latest on Obama and the globalists trying to fund ISIS.
[01:03:32.061 --> 01:03:35.703]  The latest on his fight to get our troops out of Afghanistan and other areas.
[01:03:36.304 --> 01:03:38.825]  Congressman Walter Jones popping in for about 20 minutes.
[01:03:39.586 --> 01:03:48.992]  And then I'm going to open the phones up today and go through all of these clips, many of which are up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but many of which are not.
[01:03:50.489 --> 01:03:51.970]  We already aired this, but I want to talk about it.
[01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:55.832]  Broadway show imposes Jim Crow casting call, no whites allowed.
[01:03:56.372 --> 01:03:56.932]  You know what?
[01:03:56.952 --> 01:03:59.093]  The country's so diverse, there's so many people.
[01:03:59.453 --> 01:04:01.794]  Folks have always liked to be racist and get in their own groups.
[01:04:04.096 --> 01:04:06.397]  Especially the more uneducated, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[01:04:07.257 --> 01:04:10.599]  Why not just let them have their own black-only deal?
[01:04:11.519 --> 01:04:13.140]  Oh, but you see, here's my problem.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.422]  They're going to let this group you watch have their own black-only deal.
[01:04:19.659 --> 01:04:22.582]  And then there's not going to be the allowance for white-only deals.
[01:04:26.024 --> 01:04:26.685]  I mean, here's the deal.
[01:04:26.805 --> 01:04:34.672]  I don't want to go to some country club that's already so uptight anyways that they say, you know, you have to go with a member or be accepted.
[01:04:34.712 --> 01:04:36.874]  They don't want white people there, they don't know.
[01:04:37.414 --> 01:04:39.496]  And there's black clubs where they don't want white people.
[01:04:39.836 --> 01:04:41.157]  I say knock yourselves out.
[01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:46.101]  In fact, if I'm somewhere and somebody acts like they don't want me there and it's a private place, good!
[01:04:46.121 --> 01:04:47.683]  This place sucks anyways.
[01:04:49.448 --> 01:04:51.611]  I was thinking about buying it and building condos on it.
[01:04:52.191 --> 01:04:57.478]  To quote Rodney Dangerfield and uh... and Caddyshack.
[01:05:00.561 --> 01:05:00.962]  All right.
[01:05:01.923 --> 01:05:02.484]  We'll be back.
[01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:03.865]  I forget what the Dalai Lama says there.
[01:05:04.146 --> 01:05:06.168]  Oonga galoonga or goonga galoonga?
[01:05:06.488 --> 01:05:06.929]  We'll be back.
[01:05:06.949 --> 01:05:07.369]  Stay with us.
[01:05:09.122 --> 01:05:11.564]  Going out and protesting Islamophobia?
[01:05:11.624 --> 01:05:13.365]  Guess what you've probably been looking for.
[01:05:13.525 --> 01:05:17.368]  Sharia-friendly social networks for Muslims are now on the rise.
[01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:18.089]  Hooray!
[01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:20.971]  Article up by Forbes.com.
[01:05:21.171 --> 01:05:33.501]  A month ago while attending the Startup Turkey conference in Antalya, I had the chance to talk to Shoaib Faddi, CEO and co-founder of the social networking platform... Now get ready, this is the best part... Muslimface!
[01:05:33.541 --> 01:05:36.203]  Muslimface is going to be used to help combat Islamophobia.
[01:05:36.383 --> 01:05:37.624]  Created by Donald Trump.
[01:05:37.804 --> 01:05:41.206]  Definitely not created by that racist title called Muslim Face.
[01:05:41.346 --> 01:05:43.408]  You look like you could probably be a member of Muslim Face.
[01:05:43.548 --> 01:05:45.409]  Hey, what gave you that idea?
[01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:46.970]  Well, you kind of look like a Muslim.
[01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:57.697]  He was there to pitch to potential investors his website, which also offers prayer times, job postings, a tool to locate your nearest mosque, and another button to help find your spouse.
[01:05:58.077 --> 01:06:02.340]  Now, it might not be seen the best of times to write about Islamic online content.
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.641]  You just named your website Muslim Face.
[01:06:04.821 --> 01:06:05.602]  Come on, man.
[01:06:05.802 --> 01:06:08.523]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:12.765]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:06:13.085 --> 01:06:20.368]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[01:06:39.839 --> 01:06:43.582]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today.

[01:07:02.454 --> 01:07:03.535]  That means it's pure.
[01:07:03.615 --> 01:07:06.356]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:07:06.376 --> 01:07:08.216]  Take action now before we sell out.

[01:07:10.317 --> 01:07:11.617]  You can't survive without it.
[01:07:11.797 --> 01:07:12.697]  But where do you get it?

[01:08:11.917 --> 01:08:17.924]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:18.544 --> 01:08:21.528]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:25.842 --> 01:08:40.594]  My friends, coming up at the bottom of the hour, we're going to open the phones up to cover the entire field, the entire waterfront, the economy, what's happening on the planet, the rise of ISIS, what's going on with the presidential election, Donald Trump, and so much more.
[01:08:40.614 --> 01:08:55.166]  We're going to be talking to Representative Walter Jones of North Carolina, jones.house.gov, 28pages.org, on some big developments here in just a moment dealing with Saudi finance terror and truly protecting and securing this republic.
[01:08:56.092 --> 01:08:59.954]  Then coming up, we're going to get into the latest jihad activity.
[01:09:01.594 --> 01:09:15.160]  You know the last 15, 16 years since 9-11, this isn't a topic I covered a lot because the threat was sporadic and much of it was being authorized by criminals in our government in Saudi Arabia.
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.240]  Now, ISIS is a real army.
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.681]  They're being allowed into Europe, the U.S.
[01:09:18.961 --> 01:09:20.062]  There are sleeper cells.
[01:09:20.382 --> 01:09:22.042]  You're already seeing them attack.
[01:09:22.122 --> 01:09:23.243]  This is a real threat, folks.
[01:09:24.226 --> 01:09:24.906]  The threat is real.
[01:09:25.627 --> 01:09:28.228]  Italy gears up for hundreds of thousands of new migrants.
[01:09:28.929 --> 01:09:30.629]  Other European routes closed.
[01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:32.931]  This ties into what Jones is about to talk about.
[01:09:34.071 --> 01:09:35.472]  The other Jones, the Congressman Jones.
[01:09:36.533 --> 01:09:39.174]  Because ISIS said over a year ago, we're going to flood you with millions.
[01:09:40.315 --> 01:09:41.495]  A lot of them are our fighters.
[01:09:41.535 --> 01:09:42.496]  We got sleeper cells.
[01:09:42.616 --> 01:09:43.296]  They said that.
[01:09:43.416 --> 01:09:43.997]  They've done it.
[01:09:44.357 --> 01:09:45.117]  They're bringing them in.
[01:09:45.137 --> 01:09:46.038]  They're not stopping them.
[01:09:46.258 --> 01:09:47.078]  They're bringing them in here.
[01:09:47.098 --> 01:09:47.819]  They're not vetting them.
[01:09:48.739 --> 01:09:49.660]  Look at San Bernardino.
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:59.607]  French fashion mogul hits out at Islamic clothing because all the top designers are coming out with Islamic garb as the new style.
[01:09:59.647 --> 01:10:00.867]  He says, why are you oppressing women?
[01:10:01.148 --> 01:10:02.148]  Quote, the enslavement of women.
[01:10:02.389 --> 01:10:03.930]  The left is behind this.
[01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:06.592]  They're giving the radical Islamists the keys.
[01:10:06.972 --> 01:10:07.933]  This is crazy!
[01:10:10.575 --> 01:10:11.396]  Perry Berg.
[01:10:12.476 --> 01:10:15.038]  Islamic State is on the brink of using nuclear weapons.
[01:10:15.079 --> 01:10:15.719]  Chilling Report.
[01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:16.640]  Daily Express.
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:17.160]  Gonna get to that.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.841]  Europe's Muslims hate the West.
[01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:19.342]  Politico.
[01:10:22.918 --> 01:10:26.079]  That is just some of what's coming up on that front today.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.180]  But we can't control our borders.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:33.122]  Everybody knows I've got some issues with Donald Trump on his spying and torture and the rest of it.
[01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:33.983]  He's backed off that.
[01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:35.783]  But I like his nationalism.
[01:10:36.123 --> 01:10:37.824]  I like where he stands against NAFTA and GATT.
[01:10:38.244 --> 01:10:39.605]  One-sided trade deals with China.
[01:10:40.905 --> 01:10:47.408]  Representative Walter Jones has done just as much great work as somebody like Ron Paul, who I also respect and who's a routine guest.
[01:10:47.468 --> 01:10:51.710]  He just is unsung because the media wants to ignore what he's doing because it's so good.
[01:10:52.662 --> 01:10:55.543]  And he doesn't want to be complimented, but we need to know the great work he's doing.
[01:10:56.223 --> 01:10:58.604]  28pages.org, jones.house.gov.
[01:10:59.004 --> 01:11:18.332]  And the reason I introduced him with those earlier articles is, for years he's been pushing, with members of the previous committee, it was a congressional committee, not 9-11 committee to be clear, but they also had similar findings, that there were 28 pages, to reintroduce this, that showed Major Saudi Link, stand down by our government,
[01:11:19.534 --> 01:11:24.819]  What the FBI had basically already told us happened, but the proof from a secret congressional report.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:35.348]  This is bombshell because it's ongoing and Saudi Arabia is quarterbacking ISIS and Al Qaeda today and trying to menace the West in the submission.
[01:11:35.648 --> 01:11:41.233]  If this comes out, it'll unravel the whole plan by Obama and others to bring these people in.
[01:11:43.018 --> 01:11:47.441]  Congressman Jones doesn't like to speculate, but I tell you, this isn't speculation now.
[01:11:48.062 --> 01:11:52.525]  If you look out your window and see a tornado 500 yards away coming right at you, tearing up barns.
[01:11:53.385 --> 01:11:54.286]  They're opening this up.
[01:11:54.346 --> 01:11:55.347]  They're funding these groups.
[01:11:55.367 --> 01:11:56.207]  They're protecting them.
[01:11:56.247 --> 01:11:57.368]  Saudi Arabia is running it.
[01:11:58.109 --> 01:11:59.770]  The Pentagon's come out and talked about that.
[01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:00.890]  They're coming into the country.
[01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:02.031]  They're being allowed to attack.
[01:12:02.812 --> 01:12:04.473]  Now, more than ever, we need to get this out.
[01:12:05.574 --> 01:12:06.815]  And the reason I prefaced it is,
[01:12:07.901 --> 01:12:17.251]  Congressman Jones and a handful of others, like former Senator Graham and others, have valiantly, and members of the 9-11 Commission, even though they weren't part of the Congressional Commission, they've come out and said release it.
[01:12:18.091 --> 01:12:19.173]  Because there was a cover-up.
[01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:22.991]  And now, more than ever, this cover-up has to come out to expose us.
[01:12:23.031 --> 01:12:29.093]  And the good news is, Donald Trump, the last few months, has been saying, hey, there's secret pages that need to be brought out.
[01:12:29.574 --> 01:12:31.874]  He's been talking about having a press conference with the families.
[01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:33.875]  That's very exciting.
[01:12:33.915 --> 01:12:40.077]  So it shows the attention that Walter Jones and you, the listeners, and others brought to this is bearing fruit.
[01:12:40.498 --> 01:12:41.758]  So this isn't a pep rally.
[01:12:42.018 --> 01:12:46.500]  I'm giving you a little three-minute synopsis of where we're at to let folks know that
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:52.721]  The few good men and women we've got in Congress taking action with millions of other people like you out there is having an effect.
[01:12:52.762 --> 01:13:01.124]  So I want to get orders from our general on this, Congressman Jones, to find out the latest, where we're going and what we can do to push this over the edge.
[01:13:01.504 --> 01:13:03.504]  Representative Walter Jones, thank you so much, sir.
[01:13:04.385 --> 01:13:05.485]  Well, Alex, thank you.
[01:13:05.565 --> 01:13:13.887]  And it's people like you who have access through your show to so many people that are energizing the support that we need.
[01:13:14.696 --> 01:13:17.937]  To get a declassification of the 28 pages.
[01:13:18.257 --> 01:13:31.822]  And let me say that Bob Graham, he's the former Senator from Florida, he was a co-chair at the time that they wrote the 9-11 Congressional Inquiry into the attack on New York and the other states.
[01:13:32.623 --> 01:13:43.187]  And quite frankly, it was the Bush administration, I want to make that clear, I know you're in Texas, but the Bush administration are the ones that classified the 28 pages.
[01:13:44.833 --> 01:13:52.298]  The inquiry released a whole report, but it had to go to the administration at that time, the Bush administration.
[01:13:52.978 --> 01:14:01.263]  Then they had to review the report before it was made public, and they decided, the Bush administration, that the 28 pages should be classified.
[01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:11.550]  I have read the report, other members, the 28 pages, excuse me, and other members have, and that's why we have almost 40 members of the House from both parties,
[01:14:12.423 --> 01:14:39.365]  Who have joined Steve Lynch from Massachusetts, he's a Democrat, Thomas Massey from Kentucky, Republican, and myself have put in a resolution for two sessions of Congress now, calling on the White House to keep its word to the 9-11 families, and Obama gave his word to the families, that he would declassify, or excuse me, consider declassifying the information.
[01:14:40.106 --> 01:14:45.450]  But thanks to you and many other hosts like yourself throughout this country, the word is out.
[01:14:46.711 --> 01:14:49.753]  And your preface to me getting on was exactly right.
[01:14:50.514 --> 01:14:58.279]  The Saudis are just as complicit as the Iranians in half the problems we have around this world with jihadists.
[01:14:58.479 --> 01:15:00.841]  And you're exactly right in what you said.
[01:15:00.861 --> 01:15:04.364]  I will tell you that I'm very hopeful that
[01:15:05.307 --> 01:15:23.712]  Senator Graham, myself, and Steve Lynch are going to meet with the CIA Director Clapper in early May and ask him to please do what is necessary to educate the American people and keep the word to the 9-11 families who have been so hurt since 9-11.
[01:15:28.814 --> 01:15:36.538]  Well, speaking of Saudi Arabia, I see on the news where they're involved with Hollywood, the Stock Exchange, they're trying to buy the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
[01:15:37.158 --> 01:15:38.759]  They are heavily influencing media.
[01:15:38.919 --> 01:15:40.820]  I know they censored Michael Savage's book.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.082]  I have had to actually deal with pressure they've put on us.
[01:15:44.782 --> 01:15:50.525]  This is an out-of-control government that is meddling in our affairs, I think, more than any other foreign government.
[01:15:51.045 --> 01:15:52.406]  But no one ever talks about it.
[01:15:52.746 --> 01:15:54.147]  I mean, I get critical of Israel.
[01:15:54.927 --> 01:15:55.887]  Being involved internally.
[01:15:55.947 --> 01:15:56.908]  I'm not an enemy of Israel.
[01:15:56.968 --> 01:15:57.748]  I'm a friend of Israel.
[01:15:57.968 --> 01:15:59.889]  But I don't like Israel meddling in our internal affairs.
[01:16:00.629 --> 01:16:03.130]  But no one ever talks about Saudi Arabia.
[01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:05.551]  I think it's the number one meddler, maybe after China.
[01:16:07.292 --> 01:16:09.173]  Well, Alex, I agree with you.
[01:16:09.253 --> 01:16:21.518]  I think you have stated, and many others have stated, and we have read public information that talks about how Saudi Arabia... Look at what's happening with the jihadists and the ISA.
[01:16:22.236 --> 01:16:23.637]  Where are the Saudi troops?
[01:16:23.837 --> 01:16:24.838]  They're not on the ground.
[01:16:25.458 --> 01:16:28.881]  But everybody in the Middle East wants America to put its troops on the ground.
[01:16:29.602 --> 01:16:30.722]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:16:30.763 --> 01:16:32.504]  They won't even take one refugee, sir!
[01:16:33.745 --> 01:16:34.545]  Well, that's the point.
[01:16:34.786 --> 01:16:50.838]  I mean, you know, Steve, King and I were the only two Republicans back in November when the Republican Party wanted to show the American people that we were concerned about all these immigrants coming over from Syria and these other countries.
[01:16:51.603 --> 01:17:05.255]  Uh, and we knew when Steve King and I did not vote for the House resolution that was put in by the Republican Party that says we're going to tell this administration, the Obama administration,
[01:17:05.825 --> 01:17:13.191]  You've got to do a better job of vetting these people, these 10,000 people coming into America that we agreed to take in.
[01:17:13.732 --> 01:17:19.997]  And I knew that was a shell game, Steve King knew it was a shell game, and we voted against it.
[01:17:20.277 --> 01:17:32.508]  Because what happened, Alex, was in December of this year, 2015, when we passed the budget of $1.1 trillion, the money was in there for Mr. Obama to bring in the 10,000 refugees.
[01:17:35.655 --> 01:17:36.156]  Amazing.
[01:17:36.196 --> 01:17:40.882]  And the numbers I get from people inside ICE is that it's way above what we're even being told.
[01:17:40.902 --> 01:17:44.107]  30-plus governors have asked who they are, what their names are.
[01:17:44.507 --> 01:17:45.448]  They're just being brought in.
[01:17:45.508 --> 01:17:50.235]  I'm told they're being given new names and Social Security numbers and Section 8 housing.
[01:17:51.937 --> 01:18:08.409]  I know you don't like to speculate, but looking at Europe being flooded, Merkel inviting in millions of people from war zones, mostly military-age men, not vetting them, Interpol telling them that they're full of jihadis, ISIS saying, we're coming to attack you, what is the
[01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:16.412]  I know you try to be nonpartisan to get stuff done, but particularly with the European left and with the left in this country and others.
[01:18:16.993 --> 01:18:24.335]  And I just talked about French fashion designers trying to make everything Muslim now or compliant with Sharia law.
[01:18:24.715 --> 01:18:25.756]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:18:25.876 --> 01:18:30.357]  I see it pushed even in our liberal media like this Islamic takeover.
[01:18:31.478 --> 01:18:33.158]  This is like a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:18:34.739 --> 01:18:36.359]  Alex, you're exactly right.
[01:18:36.499 --> 01:18:37.960]  I mean, when I look at
[01:18:38.931 --> 01:18:55.684]  How this country has just continued to collapse all around us, both morally and economically, talking about the jihadists and ISIS and all that is happening in this country is because the people need to understand that you have encouraged about the 28 pages.
[01:18:56.385 --> 01:19:01.709]  We need to take this country back because I think the luxury of time we do not have any longer.
[01:19:01.729 --> 01:19:04.451]  I'll give the example in my district.
[01:19:04.915 --> 01:19:10.077]  That we're on a 12 hour clock, there is no 1 a.m., and we're right at 11 o'clock.
[01:19:10.518 --> 01:19:11.518]  There's no 1 a.m.
[01:19:11.578 --> 01:19:14.899]  on the clock I'm looking at, and when it hits 12, it's over.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:31.247]  Well, I'm not singling Fox News out, but one of the largest owners of News Corp, that's just not Fox News, is one of the Saudi members of the Royal Family, and they admit they're influencing Fox News and influencing movies,
[01:19:32.555 --> 01:19:35.377]  And it's just crazy, the anti-American garbage they're pushing.
[01:19:35.397 --> 01:19:42.423]  And I'm not trying to single Saudi Arabia out, but they're the ones that are running ISIS, running Al-Qaeda, that's come out in congressional reports.
[01:19:42.923 --> 01:19:44.985]  The 28 pages has to come out.
[01:19:45.125 --> 01:19:46.045]  28pages.org.
[01:19:46.406 --> 01:19:53.931]  How excited, Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina, did you get or did you get excited to see Donald Trump make this subject front and center?
[01:19:55.272 --> 01:19:58.115]  Well, I actually spoke to one of his
[01:19:59.722 --> 01:20:00.943]  Not one of his staffers.
[01:20:00.983 --> 01:20:05.624]  This man does not work for him, but he is a supporter of Trump's in Washington.
[01:20:05.644 --> 01:20:13.267]  He's a lobbyist, quite frankly, and he came to my office one day and I was telling him about the 28 pages and I said, I'm going to tell you something.
[01:20:13.788 --> 01:20:15.028]  Rand Paul knows about it.
[01:20:15.088 --> 01:20:16.349]  He's been speaking out about it.
[01:20:16.369 --> 01:20:17.689]  You ought to give it to Donald Trump.
[01:20:17.769 --> 01:20:18.890]  I said, he's from New York.
[01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:29.174]  Let him talk about it and put pressure on this administration and put pressure on Congress to allow the American people to see the truth as to who was involved in
[01:20:29.614 --> 01:20:38.497]  9-11 and I want to go back to another point how many times the king of Saudi Arabia who's now deceased how many times was he in Crawford Texas?
[01:20:40.457 --> 01:20:42.218]  I think it was eight or nine times.
[01:20:43.899 --> 01:20:48.460]  Well you're putting it all together Alex that's why I love being on your show I listen to you and I learn things.
[01:20:49.113 --> 01:20:50.333]  I'll learn stuff from you, too, sir.
[01:20:50.734 --> 01:20:54.255]  Speaking of the fact of why I like Donald Trump, I have some problems, too.
[01:20:55.155 --> 01:20:57.516]  I have said things to him through Roger Stone.
[01:20:57.536 --> 01:20:59.137]  I've also talked to him on and off air some.
[01:20:59.917 --> 01:21:01.657]  And he goes and talks about it.
[01:21:01.677 --> 01:21:02.778]  He goes, well, let me research that.
[01:21:03.218 --> 01:21:04.538]  And then he goes and talks about it.
[01:21:04.959 --> 01:21:14.262]  And I think that's what scares the Republican establishment so much about him is that they know that he actually does want to have nationalism, does want to have fairer trade deals.
[01:21:14.782 --> 01:21:18.364]  And that he's more influenced by the people than he is by special interests.
[01:21:18.384 --> 01:21:19.405]  I think that's why they're scared of him.
[01:21:19.645 --> 01:21:24.328]  And I don't want to try to get you to wade into this, sir, but overall, what is your view of Donald Trump?
[01:21:25.809 --> 01:21:36.135]  Well, I think that now with the three left, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, I think either one of those two, and I don't know how you feel about Cruz not trying to get in that conversation.
[01:21:36.195 --> 01:21:38.437]  No, I mean, I like both of them compared to Kasich.
[01:21:38.457 --> 01:21:41.599]  Kasich's kind of just a Bush, blue blood, Rockefeller Republican.
[01:21:42.694 --> 01:21:50.053]  One of the two, in my opinion, would do what this country needs to do, and that's to get this country straight based on the Constitution.
[01:21:52.278 --> 01:21:53.058]  Well, you're right, sir.
[01:21:53.498 --> 01:21:59.260]  In the six, seven minutes we have left, because I've been throwing a lot of points out here, 28pages.org, congratulations.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.881]  This is so good for our country and the world.
[01:22:01.321 --> 01:22:09.584]  I feel like people are learning about it, even if it hasn't been declassified, thanks to the fact that you guys have basically stood up and not leaked, but said, hey, we have a right to tell you what's in this.
[01:22:09.884 --> 01:22:10.664]  What comes next?
[01:22:10.764 --> 01:22:11.624]  What else can we do?
[01:22:11.664 --> 01:22:13.225]  And what are other shoes to drop?
[01:22:13.265 --> 01:22:18.067]  And I know also you've been involved trying to get us out of Afghanistan, get us out of Iraq.
[01:22:18.087 --> 01:22:21.768]  I know you've also gotten two pilots exonerated as well.
[01:22:22.987 --> 01:22:28.049]  Yeah, well, Alex, in the little bit of time we have left, let me touch on that very quickly.
[01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:35.112]  On April the 8th of the year 2000, 19 Marines were killed at the airport in Marana, Arizona.
[01:22:35.892 --> 01:22:38.013]  They were flying a V-22 Osprey.
[01:22:38.213 --> 01:22:39.974]  They had not been adequately trained.
[01:22:40.654 --> 01:22:45.616]  The company that produced it was not, still needed to do testing on it.
[01:22:46.076 --> 01:22:48.717]  And these poor 19 Marines were killed.
[01:22:48.737 --> 01:22:50.158]  The two pilots, John Brow,
[01:22:50.805 --> 01:22:52.987]  Was the pilot, the co-pilot was Bruce Gruber.
[01:22:53.007 --> 01:22:57.570]  His wife lives in my district in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the home of Camp Lejeune Marine Base.
[01:22:58.070 --> 01:23:01.112]  She brought this to my attention in 2002.
[01:23:01.252 --> 01:23:06.836]  God put it on my heart that this woman needed help because no one was there to defend her husband.
[01:23:07.417 --> 01:23:15.022]  And we started a 14-year journey that is now concluded thanks to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Robert Work.
[01:23:15.606 --> 01:23:17.267]  Has sent out a six-page letter.
[01:23:17.367 --> 01:23:18.687]  We can get that down to you.
[01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:22.008]  And he says that these pilots should not be seen at fault.
[01:23:22.588 --> 01:23:25.549]  A lot of people helped me, Alex, to get this done.
[01:23:25.810 --> 01:23:26.650]  Can't name them all.
[01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:32.712]  But I will tell you the one that helped me the most was my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and his Father God.
[01:23:33.723 --> 01:23:34.904]  They answered my prayers.
[01:23:34.924 --> 01:23:47.910]  13 years I prayed on my knees that these two pilots would be cleared because the press release by the Marine Corps in one month after the accident said that the pilots rushed to complete the mission might have been the fatal flaw.
[01:23:48.570 --> 01:23:52.732]  Could not get the Marine Corps itself to do anything to clear up their press release.
[01:23:53.172 --> 01:23:58.795]  Had to go to the Department of Defense and they have agreed to help the families to have a little bit of peace.
[01:23:58.815 --> 01:23:59.475]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:59.995 --> 01:24:02.676]  Well, I know they're trying to get rid of all the old helicopters.
[01:24:02.736 --> 01:24:03.977]  They ought to just update those.
[01:24:04.357 --> 01:24:08.319]  I don't want to bash the defense companies and things that are trying to produce better systems.
[01:24:08.359 --> 01:24:15.702]  But from what I've talked to a lot of pilots and people, they've been trying for 15, 20 years to get the Osprey to work and be safe enough not to crash and kill everybody.
[01:24:15.722 --> 01:24:20.144]  And I remember them scapegoating the pilots when clearly it was a malfunction.
[01:24:20.444 --> 01:24:22.765]  They're up there flying something that's really still experimental.
[01:24:23.286 --> 01:24:28.188]  And look, it's like the F-35, a billion plus dollars apiece.
[01:24:28.928 --> 01:24:33.872]  Foreign pilots tell us, our own pilots tell us, it's not as good as an F-15 made 25 years ago.
[01:24:34.373 --> 01:24:36.855]  I mean, who is running the purchasing?
[01:24:36.915 --> 01:24:38.996]  Because we have the biggest defense budget ever.
[01:24:39.036 --> 01:24:40.658]  We don't need, in my view, more money.
[01:24:41.098 --> 01:24:43.981]  We need quality, and we need to actually have what works.
[01:24:44.021 --> 01:24:45.642]  What's your view on that, Congressman Jones?
[01:24:46.182 --> 01:24:48.184]  Alex, I agree with you totally.
[01:24:48.224 --> 01:24:51.447]  I've learned so much in trying to clear the names of these two Marine pilots.
[01:24:52.014 --> 01:24:53.095]  And you're exactly right.
[01:24:53.115 --> 01:24:54.796]  And let me tell you one thing very quickly.
[01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:58.459]  The waste of money in Afghanistan, I hope you saw the article.
[01:24:58.479 --> 01:25:00.140]  If you didn't, we will email it to you.
[01:25:00.881 --> 01:25:07.346]  That the Department of Defense spent six million dollars to buy nine goats from Italy.
[01:25:07.746 --> 01:25:08.407]  Nine goats!
[01:25:09.372 --> 01:25:15.857]  To get them to Western Afghanistan so they can start a goat business to make cashmere sweaters and coats and everything.
[01:25:16.398 --> 01:25:24.084]  John Sopko, the Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction, who's doing a magnificent job to wake up the American people to the waste of their money in Afghanistan.
[01:25:24.464 --> 01:25:26.046]  He testified before the Senate.
[01:25:26.486 --> 01:25:27.787]  He said, we can't find the goats.
[01:25:29.668 --> 01:25:31.470]  Well, that's, I mean, that's how these ripoffs work.
[01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:33.211]  These thousand dollar hammers or whatever.
[01:25:33.231 --> 01:25:34.432]  They were a hundred dollar hammers in the 80s.
[01:25:36.661 --> 01:25:38.623]  Say that again because we're going to put the article on screen.
[01:25:38.663 --> 01:25:39.724]  I saw that a while back.
[01:25:39.744 --> 01:25:41.165]  We're going to dig that up.
[01:25:41.545 --> 01:25:43.006]  Six million dollars for goats.
[01:25:43.987 --> 01:25:45.769]  Six million dollars for nine goats.
[01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:48.491]  There it is, Huffington Post.
[01:25:48.511 --> 01:25:49.832]  It was also in the Associated Press.
[01:25:50.152 --> 01:25:50.372]  The U.S.
[01:25:50.392 --> 01:25:54.055]  military spent millions bringing nine Italian goats to Afghanistan.
[01:25:54.075 --> 01:25:54.736]  Isn't that incredible?
[01:25:55.957 --> 01:25:56.797]  It is unbelievable.
[01:25:56.838 --> 01:26:01.001]  That's why your show is so important and you telling the truth is so important.
[01:26:01.485 --> 01:26:06.249]  The American people need to listen and to take back this country before we hit 1 a.m.
[01:26:06.289 --> 01:26:08.630]  because it's over when it is 1201.
[01:26:09.871 --> 01:26:10.211]  Absolutely.
[01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:12.293]  In the minute or two we have left, back to the 28 pages.
[01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:16.316]  I know you don't like to take credit, but I'm pretty excited here because this is a game changer.
[01:26:16.336 --> 01:26:19.778]  If this comes out, it's gonna, the Clintons are in trouble, the Bushes are in trouble.
[01:26:20.019 --> 01:26:21.059]  Well, you've seen the pages.
[01:26:21.099 --> 01:26:24.302]  Describe to people what you think is going to happen if they finally come out.
[01:26:26.041 --> 01:26:38.736]  What will happen, it will make America stronger because America will know the truth about what happened on 9-11 and what countries had an involvement in that tragic event in our country.
[01:26:40.595 --> 01:26:42.956]  And there's a reason the whole power structure doesn't want it released.
[01:26:43.776 --> 01:27:03.164]  They are scared to death, because I've talked to you about what's in it, I've talked to others that have seen it, and basically, correct me if I'm wrong, it's a stand-down, it's Saudi Arabia involved, it's our FBI trying to stop it being told to stand down, and this will basically bring a lot of people down, and they've got to know that they're not going to stop it ended up coming out.
[01:27:04.722 --> 01:27:13.247]  Alex, people will be embarrassed because they did not do their jobs and they had too close of a friendship and relationships with foreigners.
[01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:17.972]  Jones.house.gov, 28pages.org.
[01:27:18.132 --> 01:27:38.628]  We are so blessed to have people like you there, Congressman, and I hope you'll come on time from time to kind of spend 20-30 minutes with us on a review of people running for Congress, and tell us who you think is good and who you think is honorable and who we should support, because I think of you as one of the most honorable people in that whole dishonorable mess up there, so God bless you, Congressman.
[01:27:39.355 --> 01:27:40.616]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:27:40.696 --> 01:27:41.236]  I'm humbled.
[01:27:41.296 --> 01:27:42.117]  Thank you so much.
[01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:42.517]  No, no.
[01:27:42.537 --> 01:27:43.017]  Thank you, sir.
[01:27:43.057 --> 01:27:44.098]  God bless.
[01:27:44.478 --> 01:27:47.239]  That's a really great, fine Southern gentleman right there.
[01:27:47.619 --> 01:27:57.925]  And on so many issues, he tirelessly fights for veterans, for their health care, for families, for our businesses, for factories, for jobs, for sovereignty.
[01:27:58.985 --> 01:28:05.430]  And he's so nice and so gentlemanly, you really never see him on the big TV shows because he just won't get in the fights with people.
[01:28:06.090 --> 01:28:08.412]  But he's getting a lot done to defend this republic.
[01:28:08.432 --> 01:28:12.135]  And let me tell you something, those 28 pages come out,
[01:28:13.832 --> 01:28:22.359]  It is a mortal wound to the criminals, not the whole CIA, not the whole Defense Intelligence Agency, not the whole government.
[01:28:22.879 --> 01:28:27.363]  And I say that because we help the globalists when we say it's the whole government, and then we just hate the government.
[01:28:27.903 --> 01:28:31.326]  The government's too big, it's out of control, it's got to be reformed, absolutely.
[01:28:32.347 --> 01:28:37.911]  But when we just sit here and go, they're all did 9-11, they all are criminals, they're all child molesters.
[01:28:40.436 --> 01:28:46.464]  No, it's the top criminal groups at the top that are blackmailing and controlling and murdering people and killing people.
[01:28:46.845 --> 01:28:47.646]  They're the ones.
[01:28:48.327 --> 01:28:55.796]  They have an alliance with Saudi Arabia and Turkey and Israel's involved into it.
[01:28:55.977 --> 01:28:57.258]  Israel has its own evil group.
[01:28:58.055 --> 01:28:58.956]  I'm not attacking Israel.
[01:28:59.076 --> 01:29:15.085]  I'm saying Israel has evil factions and they are up to their eyeballs as well with Saudi Arabia and they double-crossed our allies like Egypt and others who were working with us and stabilizing the area and trying to have basic freedom to put in dirty, evil, filthy, murderous
[01:29:15.805 --> 01:29:16.285]  I think?
[01:29:36.053 --> 01:29:40.857]  If these anti-Trump protesters don't make you lose faith in the next generation, there's not much that can.
[01:29:41.377 --> 01:29:44.640]  And we're not trying to shame them just to feel big about ourselves.
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:51.685]  We want to show you the so-called pseudo-intellectual, political correct, social justice, white knight, goober.
[01:29:52.106 --> 01:29:56.509]  Because these are TV generation, poor zombie victims.
[01:29:56.549 --> 01:29:57.570]  They're very, very sad.
[01:29:58.411 --> 01:29:59.311]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.792 --> 01:30:01.393]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.334 --> 01:30:04.996]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.747 --> 01:30:13.410]  The New York Daily News says maybe the system really is rigged.
[01:30:13.890 --> 01:30:14.331]  You think?
[01:30:14.811 --> 01:30:23.557]  The Democrat paper came to this conclusion after contacting Democrat superdelegates in New York and asking if they would switch from Hillary to Bernie if he won the popular vote.
[01:30:24.138 --> 01:30:26.199]  Every single superdelegate said no.
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:32.324]  Just like the Republican establishment with its Never Trump movement, the Democrat establishment is Never Bernie.
[01:30:32.684 --> 01:30:34.286]  Welcome to crony socialism.
[01:30:35.006 --> 01:30:40.507]  Democrats should ask themselves why they want a crooked, rigged system to control everything.
[01:30:40.527 --> 01:30:43.968]  You know, crony capitalism can't happen without crony socialism.
[01:30:44.748 --> 01:30:46.548]  In the GOP, they steal it differently.
[01:30:47.029 --> 01:30:49.289]  There, they wait until after the election to steal it.
[01:30:49.389 --> 01:30:57.331]  Like in South Carolina, where the voters gave Trump every delegate, but Cruz came in later with the establishment and appointed his friends as delegates.
[01:30:58.291 --> 01:31:03.332]  Go to InfoWars.com to follow this open theft of our elections and to find out what you can do about it.
[01:31:03.814 --> 01:31:05.810]  For FOWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:31:09.031 --> 01:31:12.755]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:31:12.995 --> 01:31:19.120]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:26.307]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:31:26.587 --> 01:31:35.395]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[01:31:35.695 --> 01:31:41.639]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:31:41.859 --> 01:31:46.622]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:31:46.702 --> 01:31:50.084]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:31:50.284 --> 01:31:51.925]  No needles, no injections.
[01:31:52.185 --> 01:31:53.686]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:31:53.826 --> 01:31:54.867]  Try it for yourself.
[01:31:55.027 --> 01:31:56.608]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[01:31:57.348 --> 01:32:02.491]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:06.974]  Infowars Life Secret 12.
[01:32:07.034 --> 01:32:09.074]  Hey everyone!
[01:32:09.435 --> 01:32:11.675]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:32:11.715 --> 01:32:15.277]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:32:15.557 --> 01:32:17.158]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:32:17.638 --> 01:32:27.541]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:27.922 --> 01:32:33.884]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:32:34.284 --> 01:32:34.725]  We're good to go!
[01:32:49.241 --> 01:32:49.722]  I think so.
[01:33:09.833 --> 01:33:16.776]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:33:43.362 --> 01:33:45.165]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:45.185 --> 01:33:46.046]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:46.086 --> 01:33:47.067]  Central, we're live.
[01:33:47.488 --> 01:33:48.429]  We've added a fourth hour.
[01:33:49.471 --> 01:33:54.677]  Different members of our crew, reporters, and anchors hosted every day, like Paul Watson, Jakari Jackson.
[01:33:54.737 --> 01:33:57.741]  Today, it's not going to be David Knight, one of my favorites.
[01:33:58.021 --> 01:33:59.723]  It's going to be Anthony Gucciardi.
[01:33:59.763 --> 01:34:01.084]  But they all do an excellent job.
[01:34:01.605 --> 01:34:03.447]  That's why I love the fact there's four or five different hosts.
[01:34:03.467 --> 01:34:04.288]  Sometimes they co-host.
[01:34:04.648 --> 01:34:06.951]  They bring different angles, different perspectives to things.
[01:34:07.432 --> 01:34:09.234]  That's why you'll read articles at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:10.635 --> 01:34:12.816]  And see video reports that I don't totally agree with.
[01:34:13.337 --> 01:34:14.257]  Put out by my crew.
[01:34:14.738 --> 01:34:17.399]  Because we're not running a cult here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:20.101]  We're having debates, we're having discussions.
[01:34:20.801 --> 01:34:22.162]  Did anybody die at Sandy Hook?
[01:34:22.822 --> 01:34:23.863]  Was the whole thing real?
[01:34:24.383 --> 01:34:25.904]  Were there crisis actors there?
[01:34:26.585 --> 01:34:27.765]  Did they exacerbate it?
[01:34:28.346 --> 01:34:29.266]  Was some of it fake?
[01:34:29.706 --> 01:34:30.327]  Absolutely.
[01:34:32.168 --> 01:34:35.590]  Does the mainstream media come out and say that I say it's all fake, all actors?
[01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.791]  Yes.
[01:34:37.671 --> 01:34:38.271]  Is that true?
[01:34:38.772 --> 01:34:38.912]  No.
[01:34:42.216 --> 01:34:43.177]  See, that's how they operate.
[01:34:43.617 --> 01:34:57.508]  I saw a bunch of newspapers last week come out with the same lie of like four years ago, and I saw a bunch of news clips I was sent going, Alex Jones, the guy that thinks Obama sends tornadoes to Oklahoma City, now believes this.
[01:34:59.530 --> 01:35:01.792]  So just remember, that's how they deceive.
[01:35:01.832 --> 01:35:07.997]  A caller calls in three, four years ago when a tornado hits Oklahoma City and says, do you think Obama sent a weather weapon?
[01:35:08.925 --> 01:35:18.172]  And I said, no, they do have weather weapons, they do have cloud seeding, major governments have it, it was used as a weapon in Vietnam, this probably wasn't that.
[01:35:19.673 --> 01:35:22.455]  That turns into, Obama did it.
[01:35:25.577 --> 01:35:26.638]  That's how they operate.
[01:35:26.678 --> 01:35:30.040]  So just be aware of their deceptions, be aware of their operations.
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:36.705]  Because they're not just doing it with me, they're doing it across the board, lying to you, like telling you, Obamacare is free.
[01:35:38.063 --> 01:35:38.863]  Well, you found out.
[01:35:39.003 --> 01:35:39.503]  Is it free?
[01:35:39.924 --> 01:35:40.104]  No.
[01:35:40.684 --> 01:35:42.144]  Here's the toll-free number to join us.
[01:35:42.184 --> 01:35:50.567]  We're going to have open phones today for the balance of the time that I'm hosting for the next hour and 25 minutes.
[01:35:50.927 --> 01:35:53.728]  And then Gucciardi, as I said, is taking over.
[01:35:54.168 --> 01:35:56.108]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:35:56.128 --> 01:36:01.690]  First-time callers, long-time callers, you hate me, you love me, you have a question, you have a comment,
[01:36:08.914 --> 01:36:18.663]  All I ask is you not be on speakerphone and that your phone have decent audio because I don't know what it is sometimes, these calls, I can't understand them and I just get really upset and I shouldn't do that.
[01:36:20.645 --> 01:36:23.267]  Alright, let's go ahead and run through a bunch of the news.
[01:36:23.327 --> 01:36:28.292]  I'm gonna news blitz for about 10 minutes, take calls, then get back into clips, intersperse for the next hour and a half.
[01:36:29.312 --> 01:36:30.853]  Wow, there's just so much to cover here.
[01:36:31.413 --> 01:36:51.681]  Briefly, you can see the new InfoWarsLife.com product here, if you're a TV viewer right now, watching us at InfoWars.com forward slash show or stations around the country, or later on YouTube or Facebook or wherever you're watching, by the millions every day, that I have already killed my daily serving of the new amazing product.
[01:36:51.701 --> 01:36:54.222]  I don't know where the top is, I had that here earlier.
[01:36:54.242 --> 01:36:55.743]  Maybe somebody can find it for me.
[01:36:55.983 --> 01:36:56.943]  Oh, it's on the floor, sorry.
[01:36:57.203 --> 01:36:58.764]  This is unscripted teleprompter free.
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:03.242]  Why, frankly, if I was scripting all this, it'd be totally exhausting, wouldn't it?
[01:37:03.362 --> 01:37:04.103]  Basically impossible.
[01:37:05.244 --> 01:37:11.408]  Vitamin-mineral fusion, advanced multivitamin formulation, 30-plus servings.
[01:37:11.468 --> 01:37:18.413]  I say 30-plus because it's got way more than what they say because it's so strong, it's so concentrated.
[01:37:18.793 --> 01:37:27.018]  I take about half a serving, and then it's as sweet as I want it, naturally sweetened by the vitamins and minerals and plant-derived goodies that are in it.
[01:37:27.379 --> 01:37:28.920]  Read the full breakdown.
[01:37:30.347 --> 01:37:41.716]  At InfoWarsLife.com or at InfoWarsStore.com on the latest InfoWarsLife.com product.
[01:37:42.497 --> 01:37:48.102]  Now here's the deal, I don't come out with our product and say it is the very best in the galaxy and everything else is crud.
[01:37:49.676 --> 01:37:50.957]  That's not how I operate.
[01:37:51.417 --> 01:37:55.721]  I know you are viewers, you are listeners, our supporters are going to go research it and find out.
[01:37:55.841 --> 01:38:00.785]  It is amongst the best anywhere out there and the price is amazing.
[01:38:00.805 --> 01:38:00.785]  $39.95.
[01:38:01.225 --> 01:38:11.853]  There are other great brands out there that are $50, $60, $70 for the same or less of the vitamins, the minerals, the amino acids.
[01:38:12.213 --> 01:38:15.216]  This is extremely competitive, extremely high quality.
[01:38:15.956 --> 01:38:19.358]  And folks, it is so important with vitamin and mineral deficiencies out there.
[01:38:19.798 --> 01:38:24.781]  What the government says you need, in my view and the research out there, is not what you need.
[01:38:25.141 --> 01:38:32.585]  Linus Pauling found that you could take, you know, 20, 30, 40, 50 times what they say you needed of vitamin C for your body.
[01:38:33.485 --> 01:38:36.527]  And of course now they've lowered the amount of vitamin C they claim you need.
[01:38:36.827 --> 01:38:43.351]  This has a thousand percent of the daily value of vitamin C and of the very best type out there from the research.
[01:38:44.608 --> 01:38:49.391]  It's got the minerals, it's got the vitamins, it's got the amino acids, it's got what you need, and it's so amazing.
[01:38:49.431 --> 01:38:55.114]  Instead of getting Coca-Cola or Soda Pop or sugar garbage to your kids, give them this.
[01:38:55.275 --> 01:38:57.716]  They will prefer it over soda.
[01:38:58.096 --> 01:38:58.797]  I'm telling you.
[01:38:59.685 --> 01:39:03.587]  It tastes better than anything I've ever tasted.
[01:39:04.028 --> 01:39:05.749]  It took us two years to come out with this.
[01:39:05.909 --> 01:39:08.110]  It is a mega game changer.
[01:39:08.150 --> 01:39:08.851]  I need you to get it.
[01:39:09.151 --> 01:39:09.991]  I need you to try it.
[01:39:10.011 --> 01:39:13.634]  I need you to get your friends and family liking it, because if they try it, they'll want it.
[01:39:13.714 --> 01:39:21.759]  And this could be a game changer and really help us go to the next level, fighting the globalists and help you with just amazing product in your life that has
[01:39:23.283 --> 01:39:34.249]  Revolutionized so many other people's lives because when you get the proper vitamins and minerals all together at once with the amino acids and trace elements to be able to take it all up into your body, it is so incredibly important.
[01:39:34.589 --> 01:39:38.291]  Everybody knows about deficiencies in the fields, deficiencies in the soils.
[01:39:39.485 --> 01:39:45.969]  That's why I support liquid-based vitamin mineral systems, because you get such better absorption.

[01:39:53.913 --> 01:39:55.174]  It's wonderful as well.

[01:41:33.982 --> 01:41:35.002]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[01:41:35.042 --> 01:41:37.905]  Most talk show hosts plug every segment for a minute or two.
[01:41:37.965 --> 01:41:40.207]  I tend to plug one time an hour for three or four minutes.
[01:41:40.627 --> 01:41:41.548]  That's what we just did.
[01:41:42.548 --> 01:41:42.849]  All right.
[01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:45.271]  Talk about taking the plunge here.
[01:41:46.832 --> 01:41:50.295]  I want to go to Mark, Karen, Dave, Gary, Keith, everybody, and we will.
[01:41:52.332 --> 01:41:57.995]  But right now, let's get ready to plunge into the news, into the information.
[01:41:58.975 --> 01:42:06.719]  Let's start first with this clip I played earlier, but I'm going to play it again right now to kick this off.
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:08.060]  The Trump News.
[01:42:09.261 --> 01:42:13.503]  Trump says women should be punished for illegal abortions.
[01:42:13.563 --> 01:42:14.763]  That's how the media spun it.
[01:42:14.803 --> 01:42:15.464]  That's what they said.
[01:42:16.508 --> 01:42:22.990]  No, Trump said that we should end the practice of abortion and there needs to be a process to do that.
[01:42:24.770 --> 01:42:28.991]  And that yes, when women go and get it illegally, they then end up getting in trouble.
[01:42:29.031 --> 01:42:33.492]  But it really should be the doctors or the butchers, people that don't have degrees, that are doing it.
[01:42:34.413 --> 01:42:35.853]  There needs to be a phasing of it out.
[01:42:36.193 --> 01:42:37.713]  Partial birth needs to end.
[01:42:37.733 --> 01:42:38.474]  Let's start with that.
[01:42:38.814 --> 01:42:39.394]  The truth is,
[01:42:40.481 --> 01:42:43.442]  Trump has become pro-life because of children in his life.
[01:42:43.802 --> 01:42:46.683]  He's become anti-vaccine for other family reasons.
[01:42:47.484 --> 01:42:49.224]  Why do you think Robert De Niro has questions?
[01:42:50.485 --> 01:42:51.625]  You live, you learn.
[01:42:52.706 --> 01:42:55.627]  I'm concerned he wouldn't be hardcore enough on abortion, quite frankly.
[01:42:56.516 --> 01:42:58.919]  He says Planned Parenthood does a lot of good, but the abortion's wrong.
[01:42:59.319 --> 01:43:01.201]  Well, I guess, I mean, I'm not against birth control.
[01:43:01.261 --> 01:43:03.904]  I think poor people who don't want to have kids should be on birth control.
[01:43:04.785 --> 01:43:07.268]  So there's some points that are too extreme on the other side.
[01:43:07.909 --> 01:43:11.693]  And I'm not going to say crucify some woman if the baby's three weeks old and they kill it.
[01:43:12.233 --> 01:43:14.696]  Because, you know, I don't think the baby felt very much at that point.
[01:43:14.756 --> 01:43:16.238]  It's still, you're killing a human being.
[01:43:17.284 --> 01:43:18.424]  We always said, where's it in?
[01:43:18.485 --> 01:43:20.445]  Next little kids, old people, veterans?
[01:43:20.745 --> 01:43:21.626]  Yep, they're killing them.
[01:43:21.906 --> 01:43:22.146]  See?
[01:43:22.386 --> 01:43:23.326]  That's why I'm against it.
[01:43:23.887 --> 01:43:27.348]  But I'm not on a high horse up here judging people that have had abortions.
[01:43:28.769 --> 01:43:39.633]  But the people that like the partial birth of seven, eight, nine-month-old babies, they don't tell the women they're selling about baby parts, they don't tell the women there's more people wanting adoptions every year than there are abortions in this country.
[01:43:40.994 --> 01:43:46.036]  There are liberal groups that fight to keep whites and others from getting other race babies.
[01:43:47.179 --> 01:43:51.642]  There are Hispanic and black groups that try to fight to keep whites from adopting babies.
[01:43:51.682 --> 01:43:52.563]  They'd rather them be killed.
[01:43:52.983 --> 01:43:53.624]  That's in the news.
[01:43:54.044 --> 01:43:56.165]  That's how whacked out and racist some of these groups are.
[01:43:57.106 --> 01:43:58.387]  And it's despicable.
[01:43:59.008 --> 01:44:00.869]  You know, my mother couldn't have any more children after me.
[01:44:01.229 --> 01:44:03.531]  She wanted to have more of my sisters adopted from South Korea.
[01:44:05.393 --> 01:44:07.294]  And we didn't adopt her because I was a white savior.
[01:44:07.334 --> 01:44:10.036]  My parents were white saviors, you know, when I was 15 years old.
[01:44:10.556 --> 01:44:20.242]  Whenever David Knight and his wife were out at the abortion protest, and their daughter's a teenager, she's from China, from a hellish orphanage they got her from.
[01:44:20.262 --> 01:44:22.644]  I'm not going to tell you the stuff Knight told me about it.
[01:44:22.844 --> 01:44:26.586]  I mean, he may want to do a story on it someday, so you know, but he said I could talk about some of it.
[01:44:28.147 --> 01:44:29.108]  Let's just say hell on earth.
[01:44:30.242 --> 01:44:38.467]  And they're saying, I kill my baby, we're gonna kill all these black and white women out there, we love the devil, murder everybody, kill, I love death, I love killing babies.
[01:44:38.867 --> 01:44:41.069]  She goes, listen, don't kill your babies, people want those babies.
[01:44:41.429 --> 01:44:45.271]  She goes, shut up, white savior, you're not getting it, I kill it, I'll murder.
[01:44:45.672 --> 01:44:50.374]  And then she says the black lady, she's black, she's a human, so she's mainly white.
[01:44:50.735 --> 01:44:57.439]  She says the demon woman, that's a good name for her, the green-skinned, weird, translucent lizard woman, she says to her,
[01:44:58.854 --> 01:45:00.555]  Well, no, I'm not a white savior.
[01:45:00.816 --> 01:45:02.077]  My daughter's Chinese.
[01:45:02.337 --> 01:45:03.978]  She goes, exactly!
[01:45:04.579 --> 01:45:05.460]  No, she was a mother.
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:06.320]  She wanted a baby.
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:07.581]  She wanted to nurture.
[01:45:08.002 --> 01:45:10.163]  It wasn't because she wanted to be a white savior, witch.
[01:45:10.404 --> 01:45:12.265]  She has maternal instincts unlike you.
[01:45:13.186 --> 01:45:15.848]  She didn't kill her kids, and she wanted more kids.
[01:45:16.088 --> 01:45:17.089]  Get that through your head.
[01:45:17.730 --> 01:45:18.831]  Gosh, you people are evil.
[01:45:20.132 --> 01:45:21.753]  So, there's a child you're killing.
[01:45:22.674 --> 01:45:23.915]  There's a child you're killing.
[01:45:25.674 --> 01:45:27.895]  Let me tell you the sentence women get that have a bunch of abortions.
[01:45:28.035 --> 01:45:30.376]  Massive cervical, ovarian, and uterine cancer.
[01:45:30.577 --> 01:45:34.078]  You terminate pregnancies that weren't supposed to be, your body is jacked.
[01:45:35.179 --> 01:45:37.900]  They don't want you to know that, what the morning after pill does to you.
[01:45:38.481 --> 01:45:39.321]  They don't want you to know.
[01:45:39.581 --> 01:45:44.123]  If something's powerful enough to kill a baby in you, it's basically a chemotherapy pill.
[01:45:44.664 --> 01:45:47.285]  You better learn about the connections of these pills and leukemia.
[01:45:48.626 --> 01:45:50.787]  You better get the facts first, is what I'm saying.
[01:45:52.395 --> 01:45:54.637]  A lot of women get these abortions and then they get into it.
[01:45:55.137 --> 01:46:02.824]  They go, it's my choice, mine, mine, and Gloria Steinem, and women say it's fun, it's good, and Hillary killed her baby boys.
[01:46:03.144 --> 01:46:05.025]  She only kept Chelsea for a prop.
[01:46:06.867 --> 01:46:09.169]  She's a true Gloria Steinem feminist.
[01:46:09.209 --> 01:46:11.290]  These are sick freaks, folks.
[01:46:13.352 --> 01:46:15.314]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip from Trump, and we'll go to your calls.
[01:46:16.195 --> 01:46:18.036]  Should the woman be punished for having an abortion?
[01:46:19.776 --> 01:46:21.456]  This is not something you can dodge.
[01:46:21.476 --> 01:46:26.338]  If you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder, you have to deal with it under the law.
[01:46:26.718 --> 01:46:27.998]  Should abortion be punished?
[01:46:28.278 --> 01:46:34.920]  Well, people in certain parts of the Republican Party and conservative Republicans would say yes, they should be punished.
[01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:35.640]  How about you?
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:38.381]  I would say that it's a very serious problem.
[01:46:38.721 --> 01:46:40.603]  That's a problem that we have to decide on.
[01:47:03.484 --> 01:47:06.126]  Are you Catholic?
[01:47:06.226 --> 01:47:08.928]  And how do you feel about the Catholic Church's position?
[01:47:09.268 --> 01:47:12.190]  I accept the teaching authority of my church on moral issues.
[01:47:12.230 --> 01:47:14.011]  Do you know their position on abortion?
[01:47:14.051 --> 01:47:14.551]  Yes, I do.
[01:47:14.631 --> 01:47:16.453]  And do you concur with that position?
[01:47:16.693 --> 01:47:19.355]  I concur with their moral position, but legally I get to the question.
[01:47:19.415 --> 01:47:20.215]  Here's my problem.
[01:47:20.235 --> 01:47:23.377]  No, no, but let me ask you, but what do you say about your church?
[01:47:23.497 --> 01:47:24.618]  Yeah, it's really not a funny thing.
[01:47:24.938 --> 01:47:26.119]  What do you say about your church?
[01:47:26.139 --> 01:47:27.440]  They're very, very strong.
[01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:27.860]  That's enough.
[01:47:28.361 --> 01:47:32.363]  Matthews knew the camera had gone to the back shot of him, so he tried to act like Trump was laughing.
[01:47:32.563 --> 01:47:33.184]  Trump didn't laugh.
[01:47:34.445 --> 01:47:41.330]  And by the way, I love how you follow your church, you're a member, but then you say later, but he doesn't personally follow it.
[01:47:42.471 --> 01:47:43.452]  So it's all this legalese.
[01:47:45.049 --> 01:47:47.210]  Let's get this through Chris Matthews' brain.
[01:47:48.130 --> 01:47:53.373]  This is about eugenics, it's about dehumanization, it's about turning humans into garbage, and now they're a commodity.
[01:47:53.553 --> 01:47:59.656]  We heat hospitals by burning the babies' bodies, we sell their organs, and we don't tell the women it's going on.
[01:48:00.296 --> 01:48:05.339]  And now our media won't criticize Communist China, and they won't criticize Cuba arresting political dissidents.
[01:48:06.359 --> 01:48:08.740]  Next, they'll be doing that to us, and they already are.
[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:09.801]  Understand that?
[01:48:10.021 --> 01:48:12.382]  We need solidarity for humankind.
[01:48:14.994 --> 01:48:30.626]  But nobody's telling these women that there are all these Christian organizations and others that will pay you to have the baby, give you $10,000, $20,000, $40,000, $50,000 after it's born, and get you a job, and you get to see the baby three or four times a year if you want to.
[01:48:31.753 --> 01:48:34.975]  Even if they move, they pay to take you there to meet your baby.
[01:48:35.655 --> 01:48:46.742]  You get to stay with your baby, have a relationship with your baby, get money, get taken care of, and get a job, because there is a big demand for babies.
[01:48:49.764 --> 01:48:59.410]  And I'd go down to Planned Parenthood and demonstrate 20 years ago, 18 years ago, and the black, white, Hispanic people walk up to me with the same chant.
[01:48:59.590 --> 01:49:00.451]  We got it on video now.
[01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:04.572]  Nobody wants these ugly black and little Hispanic nappy-haired babies.
[01:49:04.992 --> 01:49:06.033]  Nobody wants to adopt them.
[01:49:06.293 --> 01:49:08.554]  You come get these black babies if you want them.
[01:49:08.574 --> 01:49:09.255]  And we were like, what?
[01:49:09.455 --> 01:49:10.936]  There are people wanting to adopt black babies.
[01:49:10.976 --> 01:49:11.616]  I have the numbers.
[01:49:12.317 --> 01:49:18.200]  They go... And now we have the footage of the abortion people going, nobody wants the ugly black baby!
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:18.861]  Get out of here!
[01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:22.453]  Whites, Asians, all the same thing.
[01:49:22.713 --> 01:49:23.494]  Blacks, the same deal.
[01:49:23.715 --> 01:49:24.896]  No one wants the ugly baby.
[01:49:25.257 --> 01:49:27.199]  But they're the liberals running the Planned Parenthood.
[01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:30.143]  They're the liberals who hate black people.
[01:49:30.844 --> 01:49:33.688]  And you go into these black neighborhoods, they'll be the rich blacks that rule over them.
[01:49:34.602 --> 01:49:35.463]  Kind of the Illuminati?
[01:49:36.183 --> 01:49:36.984]  The Prince Hall?
[01:49:37.424 --> 01:49:38.725]  People say the Masons are a conspiracy?
[01:49:38.946 --> 01:49:40.787]  I'll tell you where the conspiracy is, is in Black Masons.
[01:49:41.167 --> 01:49:42.368]  That's who's running the Black people.
[01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:44.050]  That's the Uncle Toms.
[01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:52.097]  That's the people, not all of them, but that tends to be the pattern, that are literally feeding on the Black people and then working with the corrupt local government.
[01:49:52.377 --> 01:49:59.503]  And that's why they ship the drugs in there, and they have the prostitutes in there, and that's the zone where you're allowed to have criminal activity, is in the Black neighborhood.
[01:50:00.387 --> 01:50:06.772]  Where then if a black mother, single mother, doesn't want her kids to be destroyed, she has to lock them up in the house for their life!
[01:50:07.533 --> 01:50:09.234]  Or they'll end up being forced into the system.
[01:50:09.714 --> 01:50:11.295]  You want the real racist conspiracy?
[01:50:11.576 --> 01:50:12.136]  There it is.
[01:50:14.318 --> 01:50:15.499]  Now I'm off on a whole jag.
[01:50:15.759 --> 01:50:16.620]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:18.061]  We're going to go to break and come back and go to Mark.
[01:50:18.081 --> 01:50:19.482]  We're going to go to David.
[01:50:19.502 --> 01:50:20.202]  We're going to go to Gary.
[01:50:20.222 --> 01:50:21.744]  We're going to go to Keith, Karen, and many others.
[01:50:22.124 --> 01:50:24.025]  And then I'm going to start getting into more of the Trump news.
[01:50:24.045 --> 01:50:24.566]  Here's some of it.
[01:50:25.854 --> 01:50:29.195]  Coming up, Hannity and Judge Napolitano on Lewandowski video.
[01:50:29.216 --> 01:50:29.856]  Nothing happened.
[01:50:29.896 --> 01:50:31.396]  Zero evidence of unintentional harm.
[01:50:31.456 --> 01:50:31.657]  Yeah.
[01:50:32.817 --> 01:50:34.818]  We're about to have war with Communist China, perhaps.
[01:50:34.838 --> 01:50:35.738]  That's in the news next.
[01:50:36.299 --> 01:50:38.960]  But we got to hear about Lewandowski grabbing someone by the arm.
[01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:39.780]  Didn't even look like that.
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.641]  And that ties into this other hysteria.
[01:50:41.961 --> 01:50:45.643]  I saw this when I watched the press conference the other day.
[01:50:46.283 --> 01:50:47.424]  My reporters were nearby.
[01:50:49.235 --> 01:50:50.015]  I thought nothing of it.
[01:50:50.056 --> 01:50:51.176]  Then it was in the news last night.
[01:50:51.456 --> 01:50:55.098]  This morning, I heard coming up, Donald Trump knocks phone out of a reporter's hand.
[01:50:55.619 --> 01:50:58.881]  He gets up, the reporter has the phone out, he barely bumps it, apologizes.
[01:50:59.141 --> 01:51:03.383]  They're acting like he's a murderer now that he bumped into a phone.
[01:51:03.884 --> 01:51:07.626]  I mean, if Donald Trump is caught with a crooked toenail, they're going to execute him.
[01:51:09.195 --> 01:51:10.336]  Are you prepared to bug out?
[01:51:10.376 --> 01:51:18.380]  Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger have produced a high-speed DVD and book to show you how to drive in combat, patrol, and how to survive in combat.

[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:14.501]  Should an 8-pack of blades really cost $32?
[01:52:14.841 --> 01:52:16.902]  At Harry's, our answer is no.

[01:53:38.137 --> 01:53:41.018]  The final phase of extermination is set to commence now.
[01:53:41.459 --> 01:53:46.741]  And as population die-off becomes evident, you know it is the time of punishment in all that is written.
[01:53:46.941 --> 01:53:52.704]  The cover for mass die-off is evolution and global warming frauds, also used as false proof of their Christ.
[01:53:53.165 --> 01:53:56.446]  They are from the lines that were disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:53:56.786 --> 01:54:01.429]  Now they claim to be his Christ, based upon blood type, DNA, and long lifespan.

[01:54:15.407 --> 01:54:18.148]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:18.568 --> 01:54:22.109]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:54:22.529 --> 01:54:26.571]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:54:27.151 --> 01:54:28.611]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:54:29.492 --> 01:54:30.872]  And then later, I'm going to play this clip.
[01:54:30.892 --> 01:54:32.253]  I'm going to describe it for radio listeners.
[01:54:32.293 --> 01:54:34.954]  Where Trump's on his jet, he's super polite, super nice.
[01:54:35.014 --> 01:54:36.834]  And his people come and say, hey, we gotta go.
[01:54:36.874 --> 01:54:37.775]  And he goes, hey, I gotta go.
[01:54:38.315 --> 01:54:38.955]  Thank you, everybody.
[01:54:38.975 --> 01:54:39.555]  He gets up.
[01:54:39.575 --> 01:54:40.836]  The reporter's still got his phone stuck out.
[01:54:40.856 --> 01:54:41.816]  He barely bumps it.
[01:54:43.086 --> 01:54:45.689]  And Trump goes, oh, I'm so sorry, knowing he's got to just grovel.
[01:54:47.370 --> 01:54:49.712]  And then now it's all over the news that he attacked everybody.
[01:54:49.772 --> 01:54:50.373]  Oh, you have the clip?
[01:54:50.393 --> 01:54:52.735]  All right, let's play this.
[01:54:52.815 --> 01:54:53.796]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:54:53.816 --> 01:54:54.177]  Here it is.
[01:54:55.782 --> 01:55:04.008]  That is getting bigger and bigger and worse and worse, and mark my words, it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better, unless I'm elected president.
[01:55:04.028 --> 01:55:05.249]  I will stop the problem.
[01:55:05.329 --> 01:55:06.329]  Okay, we gotta go.
[01:55:06.369 --> 01:55:07.150]  Whoops, sorry.
[01:55:07.290 --> 01:55:09.131]  Okay, thank you everybody.
[01:55:09.512 --> 01:55:10.352]  I'll see you at the speech.
[01:55:10.372 --> 01:55:19.659]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I have been in press conferences before where there's one time in England there was like 50 microphones and recorders out there covering Bilderberg.
[01:55:20.499 --> 01:55:21.920]  And you're just bumping into people.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.001]  Phones are falling.
[01:55:23.461 --> 01:55:24.282]  People will push.
[01:55:24.322 --> 01:55:27.444]  The crowd was like 3,000, 4,000 fans that just showed up.
[01:55:27.624 --> 01:55:28.624]  And they were pushing them.
[01:55:28.644 --> 01:55:29.865]  People were falling down.
[01:55:31.146 --> 01:55:32.047]  This is crazy.
[01:55:32.387 --> 01:55:37.350]  He literally barely turns and barely touches the phone they're recording on.
[01:55:37.370 --> 01:55:38.751]  Oh, sorry.
[01:55:38.911 --> 01:55:40.152]  And then it's national news.
[01:55:40.212 --> 01:55:44.395]  I mean, next it'll be, did you hear how he killed a person with a phone?
[01:55:45.556 --> 01:55:47.817]  And then Ted Cruz will call for murdering him or something.
[01:55:48.337 --> 01:55:50.718]  Mark, in Minnesota, on nuclear terrorism.
[01:55:50.998 --> 01:55:52.519]  Yeah, ISIS says they got nukes.
[01:55:53.059 --> 01:55:54.100]  And people say, oh, they can't get them.
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:55.400]  Somebody might give them one, folks.
[01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:57.201]  China to US, be careful.
[01:55:57.521 --> 01:56:00.002]  In South China Sea, threatens military attack.
[01:56:00.262 --> 01:56:01.723]  That's the kind of stuff coming up in the next hour.
[01:56:01.823 --> 01:56:02.383]  Mark, go ahead.
[01:56:04.324 --> 01:56:04.784]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:04.884 --> 01:56:11.487]  I wanted to thank you and your organization for being there and for promoting and giving us the information that we need to figure out what's going on.
[01:56:13.868 --> 01:56:14.428]  This morning,
[01:56:15.354 --> 01:56:21.915]  There was a bulletin that Britain is going to be shipping tons of nuclear waste here to the United States.
[01:56:23.416 --> 01:56:30.637]  Also this morning, Obama is going to be having some type of a summit on nuclear terrorism.
[01:56:31.877 --> 01:56:42.519]  Another bulletin came out that Belgium is finally accepting help from the US concerning terrorism, probably because of the information about that possible attack on their nuclear reactor.
[01:56:43.836 --> 01:56:54.312]  And I'm just kind of concerned that given what happened regarding San Bernardino, the day before, President Obama said, we really don't have anything to worry about from ISIS.
[01:56:55.113 --> 01:56:57.697]  And then the next day, the San Bernardino attacks happened.
[01:56:59.198 --> 01:57:04.362]  And then he said something like that again, and then the situation in Brussels, Belgium happened.
[01:57:04.402 --> 01:57:05.022]  No, I agree with you.
[01:57:05.062 --> 01:57:05.983]  Let me stop right there.
[01:57:06.423 --> 01:57:13.868]  When I'm calm at home, eating breakfast or dinner with the kids and, you know, not on air, my brain slows down, but it almost speeds up, you know what I mean?
[01:57:14.188 --> 01:57:15.069]  And it gets real clear.
[01:57:15.329 --> 01:57:22.674]  All the nuke terror chatter, all the hype, Obama saying, what really keeps me up at night two years ago, let's find the clip if we can.
[01:57:24.055 --> 01:57:26.457]  What keeps me up at night is a mushroom cloud over Manhattan.
[01:57:27.501 --> 01:57:28.884]  It won't be ISIS that does it.
[01:57:29.004 --> 01:57:30.667]  His people could do it, or others.
[01:57:31.127 --> 01:57:32.309]  Bring in martial law.
[01:57:32.630 --> 01:57:37.739]  They've got the preparations ready, and I'm telling you, they're so bold, they could do anything.
[01:57:38.079 --> 01:57:39.001]  And my gut...
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:40.940]  It's funny you say that.
[01:57:41.321 --> 01:57:46.103]  I keep meaning to come in and do a whole show about nuclear false flag, but then I self-censor.
[01:57:46.163 --> 01:57:47.043]  I go, no, Alex.
[01:57:47.664 --> 01:57:49.084]  They're going to think you're fear-mongering.
[01:57:49.104 --> 01:57:49.704]  Well, you know what?
[01:57:49.845 --> 01:57:50.345]  I don't care.
[01:57:50.765 --> 01:57:51.745]  I'm really in my gut.
[01:57:52.066 --> 01:57:52.946]  See all the chatter.
[01:57:53.346 --> 01:57:54.207]  See the history.
[01:57:54.547 --> 01:57:55.647]  See the preparations.
[01:57:55.987 --> 01:57:56.808]  See the boldness.
[01:57:57.048 --> 01:57:59.649]  And I think it's a real threat, and I think you're right.
[01:57:59.709 --> 01:58:01.850]  Go ahead.
[01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:04.191]  Yeah, that's pretty much what I had to say right now.
[01:58:04.211 --> 01:58:05.732]  That's all I thought I had to say.
[01:58:06.633 --> 01:58:07.373]  Well, you're freaking me out.
[01:58:07.753 --> 01:58:09.474]  Because that's exactly what keeps me up at night.
[01:58:09.494 --> 01:58:10.574]  In fact, I don't even want to get into it.
[01:58:10.614 --> 01:58:11.635]  I can't handle this anymore.
[01:58:11.695 --> 01:58:12.655]  I'm gonna be honest with people.
[01:58:13.035 --> 01:58:14.575]  Folks, I shouldn't be in this position.
[01:58:14.615 --> 01:58:18.737]  I'm just some regular guy from Texas who can see what's going on and will talk about it.
[01:58:19.837 --> 01:58:23.218]  I got congressmen on trying to release secret documents that will bring the government down.
[01:58:23.818 --> 01:58:26.179]  You know, we got... I can't even get into it.
[01:58:26.199 --> 01:58:27.039]  It's Twilight Zone.
[01:58:27.399 --> 01:58:29.340]  It's beyond a James Bond movie.
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:31.301]  Meets the outer limits.
[01:58:31.361 --> 01:58:31.881]  I'm telling you.
[01:58:32.688 --> 01:58:34.568]  That's why the public isn't aware of what's going on.
[01:58:34.608 --> 01:58:35.709]  They think their life's boring.
[01:58:35.769 --> 01:58:37.249]  Folks, it isn't boring.
[01:58:38.289 --> 01:58:39.170]  Here's just one example.
[01:58:39.250 --> 01:58:40.530]  There's thousands of things like this.
[01:58:40.590 --> 01:58:41.810]  Hundreds and hundreds, to be conservative.
[01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:44.031]  They say the biggest quake in U.S.
[01:58:44.071 --> 01:58:45.351]  history may hit any time.
[01:58:45.411 --> 01:58:46.071]  It's overdue.
[01:58:46.391 --> 01:58:47.592]  All the seismographs show it.
[01:58:47.632 --> 01:58:49.932]  It could destroy San Francisco or L.A.
[01:58:50.312 --> 01:58:51.693]  No one's hardly even concerned.
[01:58:53.013 --> 01:58:54.433]  What's that going to do to the economy?
[01:58:54.733 --> 01:58:57.234]  The Chinese are threatening to nuke the fleet.
[01:58:59.039 --> 01:58:59.519]  We're good to go.
[01:59:22.649 --> 01:59:31.454]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:59:31.774 --> 01:59:37.617]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:59:37.997 --> 01:59:44.360]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:49.803]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:59:50.103 --> 01:59:52.366]  Now available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:52.586 --> 01:59:54.748]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:59:54.809 --> 01:59:57.231]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.082 --> 02:00:15.085]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:00:15.666 --> 02:00:19.810]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:45.316 --> 02:00:47.038]  Alright, we're back, taking your phone calls.
[02:00:47.619 --> 02:00:49.401]  That last caller completely freaked me out.
[02:00:50.643 --> 02:01:04.720]  Because driving home at work, at night, waking up in the middle of the night, this morning, I was on the elliptical, and I saw this news about a nuclear armed ISIS, and you know, saying that they've got nuclear material, not just a dirty bomb.
[02:01:06.786 --> 02:01:15.568]  And I know about how our government under Clinton gave reactors that can make hydrogen and atomic bombs to Kim Jong-il, the father of Kim Jong-un.
[02:01:16.308 --> 02:01:17.709]  And then all these hundreds of points come in.
[02:01:17.749 --> 02:01:22.510]  It's why I get exhausted by like five or six now, because I have so much data.
[02:01:22.570 --> 02:01:28.231]  I mean, when I think about something, I can like pull up in my mind this whole 3D map, but that gets exhausting.
[02:01:28.571 --> 02:01:31.352]  So I'll just do it for all this petty stuff.
[02:01:34.033 --> 02:01:39.517]  No, we have to get the right light bulbs for the house, and then I'll spend an hour messing around with light bulbs.
[02:01:40.258 --> 02:01:41.239]  Everybody knows how this is.
[02:01:41.279 --> 02:01:41.999]  I'm not complaining.
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:50.886]  Or spilt protein shake in your kid's backpack, and it smells like a dead animal, and you're cleaning the car out, and you're... You know how it is.
[02:01:50.926 --> 02:01:57.331]  Or a water leak in the ceiling, or, you know, the broken sprinklers, and I'm just jacking with all this all day.
[02:01:58.152 --> 02:02:02.695]  Or jacking with the people that are helping me, who are great folks, instead of like the big issues.
[02:02:03.275 --> 02:02:05.616]  And I'm driving to work going, I gotta talk about nuclear terrorism.
[02:02:05.916 --> 02:02:07.177]  I gotta talk about the big one coming.
[02:02:07.437 --> 02:02:10.679]  I gotta talk about, you know, any trigger for a civil emergency.
[02:02:10.699 --> 02:02:12.620]  It could be a giant West Coast earthquake.
[02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:14.181]  What could Obama use?
[02:02:14.501 --> 02:02:16.022]  All the preparations point towards it.
[02:02:16.262 --> 02:02:18.223]  How do we put the word out to stop him from doing it?
[02:02:18.483 --> 02:02:19.044]  You've gotta...
[02:02:20.031 --> 02:02:21.032]  Yes, a great show as always there, Alex.
[02:02:21.052 --> 02:02:23.675]  Hey, I was wondering about the Obama phone lady who she's supporting for president.
[02:02:42.818 --> 02:02:49.803]  Um, we should probably try to get... I was gonna say, you guys go up there for that convention, stop on by, pay her a visit, that'd be nice of you.
[02:02:50.443 --> 02:02:53.385]  Yeah, we probably need to get the Obama phone lady back on the broadcast.
[02:02:53.445 --> 02:02:58.248]  She is a really fun lady to hang out with and very, very interesting, her and her husband.
[02:02:59.489 --> 02:03:03.832]  Yes, and I get a lot of good information when I hear them talk about what's going on in their part of the country, too.
[02:03:04.741 --> 02:03:07.343]  Well, let me tell you, I'm going to be up there for at least a week and a half.
[02:03:07.863 --> 02:03:09.744]  I can't be away from my kids longer than that.
[02:03:10.225 --> 02:03:11.565]  But I'm going to be up there covering it.
[02:03:11.605 --> 02:03:13.747]  Roger Stone's going to be covering it for a full month.
[02:03:14.387 --> 02:03:20.331]  And Roger says we can be embedded, not in bed, but embedded with him and some folks.
[02:03:20.371 --> 02:03:27.936]  So, InfoWars is going to have fantastical level coverage of this epic RNC 2016.
[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:34.926]  I was going to say, there's a lot of people changing their party affiliations.
[02:03:35.006 --> 02:03:40.855]  In the area where I live, in the three county radius, over 5,000 people have gone from Democrat to Republican.
[02:03:41.596 --> 02:03:46.180]  I was about to say trendy, liberal, white, black, Hispanic, whatever, hate Trump and get into it.
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:55.988]  But when I talk to working class, blue collar, or even entry level white collar, white people, blacks, Hispanics, anybody, they're like, we love Trump, it's all hype, he's Americana, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[02:03:56.048 --> 02:03:56.789]  I mean, they get it.
[02:03:57.450 --> 02:03:59.051]  And so they like it because he's different.
[02:03:59.391 --> 02:04:01.593]  They like it because the South loves him.
[02:04:02.093 --> 02:04:04.916]  See how they claim the South hates the North?
[02:04:05.216 --> 02:04:05.857]  That's not true.
[02:04:07.222 --> 02:04:12.125]  So, it's a very exciting time to be alive right now, and Trump, if he gets elected, better deliver.
[02:04:12.445 --> 02:04:15.107]  Or I will make it my life's mission to bring him down.
[02:04:15.367 --> 02:04:16.087]  And he knows that.
[02:04:16.327 --> 02:04:17.588]  Look, he's for real, folks.
[02:04:17.888 --> 02:04:19.789]  He's betting everything he's got on this.
[02:04:20.389 --> 02:04:21.830]  He's not part of the establishment.
[02:04:22.050 --> 02:04:24.792]  That's why they are, you know what-ing, a brick right now.
[02:04:25.052 --> 02:04:25.933]  Closing comments, Dave?
[02:04:25.953 --> 02:04:32.536]  Yeah, I think if anything, no matter who they put against Trump, Trump will beat them in a land fight.
[02:04:32.556 --> 02:04:33.357]  I don't care who it is.
[02:04:34.130 --> 02:04:36.091]  Yeah, that's why the Democrats are pulling their hair out.
[02:04:36.151 --> 02:04:38.232]  They know the Reagan Democrats, blue-collar Democrats.
[02:04:38.272 --> 02:04:41.593]  He's polling double what any Republican's done since Eisenhower.
[02:04:42.493 --> 02:04:54.258]  The last time blacks were voting for a Republican in a primary at this level was Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was a huge civil rights activist and had people death-threatening him, who passed the Civil Rights Act once he got in.
[02:04:55.768 --> 02:04:56.529]  It's just crazy.
[02:04:56.949 --> 02:04:59.671]  Alright, I appreciate you calling into the broadcast.
[02:05:00.072 --> 02:05:01.113]  Alright, more callers.
[02:05:01.253 --> 02:05:05.156]  Gary, Karen, Keith, James, others.
[02:05:05.176 --> 02:05:06.257]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[02:05:06.277 --> 02:05:06.317]  800-259-9231.
[02:05:09.142 --> 02:05:11.584]  Going out and protesting Islamophobia?
[02:05:11.624 --> 02:05:13.365]  Guess what you've probably been looking for?
[02:05:13.545 --> 02:05:17.388]  Sharia-friendly social networks for Muslims are now on the rise!
[02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:18.109]  Hooray!
[02:05:18.369 --> 02:05:33.241]  Article up by Forbes.com A month ago, while attending the Startup Turkey conference in Antalya, I had the chance to talk to Shoaib Faddi, CEO and co-founder of the social networking platform... Now get ready, this is the best part... MuslimFace!
[02:05:33.541 --> 02:05:36.223]  MuslimFace is gonna be used to help combat Islamophobia!
[02:05:36.383 --> 02:05:37.624]  Created by Donald Trump.
[02:05:37.824 --> 02:05:41.205]  Definitely not created by that racist title called Muslim Face.
[02:05:41.365 --> 02:05:43.946]  You look like you could probably be a member of Muslim Face.
[02:05:44.126 --> 02:05:45.427]  What gave you that idea?
[02:05:45.607 --> 02:05:46.988]  Well, you kind of look like a Muslim.
[02:05:47.128 --> 02:05:57.692]  He was there to pitch to potential investors his website, which also offers prayer times, job postings, a tool to locate your nearest mosque, and another button to help find your spouse.
[02:05:58.073 --> 02:06:02.354]  Now, it might not be seen the best of times to write about Islamic online content.
[02:06:02.495 --> 02:06:04.575]  You just named your website Muslim Face.
[02:06:04.836 --> 02:06:05.596]  Come on, man.

[02:07:08.667 --> 02:07:15.071]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[02:07:15.171 --> 02:07:27.958]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:07:28.138 --> 02:07:31.541]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:07:31.801 --> 02:07:38.487]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:07:38.787 --> 02:07:51.597]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:07:51.658 --> 02:07:53.219]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:07:53.499 --> 02:07:59.668]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[02:07:59.888 --> 02:08:04.835]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:35.231]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:35.691 --> 02:08:39.932]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:40.872 --> 02:08:46.093]  I was almost late getting in here because I was busy honchoing, getting my good buddy Weldon Henson.
[02:08:46.153 --> 02:08:47.754]  It was a wonderful country music band.
[02:08:47.774 --> 02:08:48.494]  It's very popular.
[02:08:49.494 --> 02:08:50.074]  Named, uh, what?
[02:08:50.794 --> 02:08:53.235]  Band of the Year or whatever just a few weeks ago here in Austin.
[02:08:53.795 --> 02:08:54.435]  Gonna go play
[02:08:55.968 --> 02:08:58.029]  Next week for my grandma at her nursing home.
[02:08:58.569 --> 02:09:01.351]  She finally had to be put in a nursing home about a year ago, but she's still all there.
[02:09:01.371 --> 02:09:03.012]  Great lady.
[02:09:03.732 --> 02:09:04.212]  A Christian.
[02:09:05.413 --> 02:09:06.994]  She's had, uh, I'm not gonna get into it.
[02:09:07.034 --> 02:09:09.535]  Point is, she is, she's the type of person that is tough.
[02:09:10.596 --> 02:09:11.176]  And, um...
[02:09:12.654 --> 02:09:23.700]  The reason I digress off into all of that is I've been trying for three months to get him over the phone to let Weldon come play for the old folks, because they have folks that come and play there, but they're not usually as successful as he is.
[02:09:24.101 --> 02:09:28.663]  And I finally said this morning, I said, you go march in there personally and do it and get it done that way.
[02:09:29.324 --> 02:09:31.565]  And then now it's all set up quicker than I even wanted.
[02:09:32.505 --> 02:09:36.688]  But we're going to have barbecue over there and stuff like that.
[02:09:38.783 --> 02:09:43.987]  But that just shows how digital stuff is somewhat effective to wake people up or to inform them.
[02:09:44.067 --> 02:09:49.631]  But when it comes to physically going and getting in people's faces, that's what gets things done.
[02:09:49.952 --> 02:09:54.975]  That's why we've all got to be in Ohio and Cleveland when they try to steal the nomination for Trump.
[02:09:55.416 --> 02:10:04.122]  Even if you hate Donald Trump, you shouldn't let them steal the nomination from him if he's got 500 more delegates than Ted Cruz.
[02:10:05.083 --> 02:10:05.984]  Which he's set to have.
[02:10:06.364 --> 02:10:07.705]  What's the magic number?
[02:10:07.725 --> 02:10:07.705]  1,236.
[02:10:08.166 --> 02:10:20.157]  He's going to be just a few shy of that, and now Ted Cruz and Kasich are on TV saying, we want to be positioned to not give him the nomination and the 1,236.
[02:10:24.161 --> 02:10:27.263]  No one has ever had a contested election where the
[02:10:29.068 --> 02:10:33.250]  Delegates weren't almost the same, and then there was some battle because it was so close.
[02:10:33.570 --> 02:10:34.410]  That's all that's for.
[02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:38.052]  This is incredible steel out in the open.
[02:10:40.112 --> 02:10:45.815]  Bill Clinton says he would give Bernie Sanders his superdelegate vote if the Vermont senator wins the nomination.
[02:10:49.836 --> 02:10:51.217]  That's like Bill Clinton saying,
[02:10:52.403 --> 02:10:53.584]  He would vote against Hillary.
[02:10:53.624 --> 02:10:54.945]  Man, this is getting weirder and weirder.
[02:10:55.266 --> 02:10:56.747]  He comes out and bad-mouths Obama.
[02:10:57.387 --> 02:10:58.689]  Now he's bad-mouthing Hillary.
[02:10:59.109 --> 02:11:01.791]  Hillary's stealing his superdelegates from Bernie.
[02:11:02.352 --> 02:11:03.853]  What is going on?
[02:11:07.476 --> 02:11:14.563]  And I'm not being mean when I say that Bill Clinton could march onto a Hollywood set as a zombie today.
[02:11:15.558 --> 02:11:20.203]  With no makeup and be the star of a high-budget zombie film.
[02:11:20.623 --> 02:11:24.067]  He looks like a reanimated corpse-sickle.
[02:11:25.548 --> 02:11:26.730]  What do you think's really going on there?
[02:11:28.412 --> 02:11:30.374]  Now, I'm gonna go to your calls, Gary.
[02:11:31.733 --> 02:11:36.294]  And James, and Karen, and Keith, and everybody else here in just a moment.
[02:11:36.314 --> 02:11:37.554]  Get back in all the Trump news.
[02:11:38.154 --> 02:11:47.657]  But we already knew this was going on, but this is what I want Rob, Dewey, and the crew, I forgot to tell them this, to talk to the folks on the ground about how much were you paid and who bussed you in here.
[02:11:47.677 --> 02:11:50.357]  Because it's moveon.org mainly, that's George Soros.
[02:11:51.778 --> 02:11:57.959]  But the followers are so dumb, they will load up bus loads of Bernie Sanders supporters to go take
[02:11:59.142 --> 02:12:07.827]  Orders from Hillary's MoveOn.org to then blame him when his supporters do bad things.
[02:12:08.627 --> 02:12:11.669]  I mean, that's what it's like when you've got followers that are this stupid.
[02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:13.610]  I mean, these are really dumb people.
[02:12:15.231 --> 02:12:16.752]  It's a Paul Joseph Watson article.
[02:12:16.812 --> 02:12:18.313]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:12:19.614 --> 02:12:22.495]  I don't say they're dumb, again, for my ego.
[02:12:22.876 --> 02:12:25.377]  It doesn't make me feel good to be part of the same species.
[02:12:26.237 --> 02:12:28.339]  I don't think of myself as rocket science smart.
[02:12:29.119 --> 02:12:31.801]  But I'm like a god compared to these people.
[02:12:32.862 --> 02:12:33.903]  They know nothing.
[02:12:34.163 --> 02:12:36.025]  I don't care what color they are, where they're from.
[02:12:36.425 --> 02:12:52.438]  You talk to an institutionalized yuppie liberal, TV head, video game smartphone head, and all they know is weird political correct statements that they state and then smile like they're supposed to get a gold star and a lollipop, like a trained seal.
[02:12:53.319 --> 02:12:57.843]  You can take a seal that's had electroshock convulsive therapy,
[02:13:00.017 --> 02:13:04.158]  Or lobotomy, and it can do tricks for kids.
[02:13:07.198 --> 02:13:15.820]  So, when I marvel at them, it's like, look at the product of this higher education and standard education, primary education system.
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:24.882]  It creates devil worshippers, communists, weirdos, twits, morons, people that can hardly walk or talk.
[02:13:26.118 --> 02:13:28.560]  That run around screaming, trying to take free speech.
[02:13:29.441 --> 02:13:31.402]  That's what this machine produces.
[02:13:31.723 --> 02:13:36.847]  That's where this, it's like North Korea announced, prepare for millions to starve to death again, as millions have.
[02:13:37.388 --> 02:13:39.790]  That's your announcement, we're gonna let you starve, get ready.
[02:13:39.810 --> 02:13:45.554]  And then all these college kids want to be communists.
[02:13:47.496 --> 02:13:49.718]  Craigslist ad, with their little smartphones.
[02:13:50.599 --> 02:13:54.222]  Get paid $15 an hour to protest at the Trump rally.
[02:13:56.397 --> 02:14:01.278]  Post promotes pre-protest instructions and a shuttle bus to the event.
[02:14:02.099 --> 02:14:07.240]  A pro-Bernie Sanders Craigslist ad invites people in Wisconsin to protest against Donald Trump for $15 an hour.
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:15.902]  Beneath the image of Bernie Sanders' t-shirt, the ad, which was posted on Tuesday Morning Reads, paid positions for protesters at the Trump rally.
[02:14:16.482 --> 02:14:18.863]  We tried to get there in time to go to this, but it was already over by then.
[02:14:19.303 --> 02:14:24.104]  I will bet you, just come out and moveon.org, meted it in Chicago and New York and a bunch, and Florida.
[02:14:24.565 --> 02:14:25.965]  I bet you my left arm.
[02:14:27.423 --> 02:14:32.189]  Not the right, because I might be wrong, but I'm 98% right, that this was moveon.org.
[02:14:32.209 --> 02:14:34.171]  I mean, they're the main group doing it, so it's not a hard guess.
[02:14:35.693 --> 02:14:38.536]  Getting the Bernie dum-dums, because there are no real Hillary supporters.
[02:14:38.556 --> 02:14:38.876]  She'll have 50,000.
[02:14:39.537 --> 02:14:40.038]  She'll have 1,000.
[02:14:40.899 --> 02:14:41.780]  I mean, this is it.
[02:14:44.583 --> 02:14:45.224]  That's all they got.
[02:14:46.245 --> 02:14:47.006]  It's all they'll ever be.
[02:14:48.567 --> 02:14:52.132]  And then they're used to go out and act like morons in their Bernie shirts.
[02:14:52.152 --> 02:14:54.955]  Because, hey, we want you to go out and protest Trump.
[02:14:55.015 --> 02:14:57.859]  They know the only real Democrat voters are Bernie supporters.
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:14:59.220]  They mean well.
[02:15:00.702 --> 02:15:01.283]  God bless them.
[02:15:01.724 --> 02:15:05.789]  They show up and they're loaded on a Hillary bus to be taken to make him look bad.
[02:15:07.037 --> 02:15:14.026]  A pro-Bernie Sanders Craiglist ad invites people in Wisconsin to protest against Trump for $15 an hour beneath the image of a Bernie Sanders t-shirt.
[02:15:14.266 --> 02:15:18.871]  The ad, which was posted Tuesday, paid positions for protesters at Trump rally.
[02:15:19.272 --> 02:15:22.416]  Shuttle buses, parking signs, and hourly pay available.
[02:15:22.716 --> 02:15:24.758]  $15 an hour due to economic inequality.
[02:15:25.259 --> 02:15:26.420]  That's all about the minimum wage.
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:34.406]  Meet at 3300 W. Tripp Road, Janesville, Wisconsin, for pre-protest instructions and to get your time card.
[02:15:34.787 --> 02:15:38.870]  And you see them standing around like they're security, standing around, you have the leaders of it.
[02:15:40.311 --> 02:15:43.714]  To be a leader, you gotta be able to at least make sounds.
[02:15:44.935 --> 02:15:49.058]  Most of them can't talk, but you gotta... And then you get a position.
[02:15:53.010 --> 02:15:55.671]  Oh my goodness, we have a lot to cover here, don't we?
[02:15:56.611 --> 02:16:02.932]  Here's a big Esquire article about where is Trump's political campaign really going?
[02:16:03.252 --> 02:16:05.913]  What's really going on inside Trump's political operation?
[02:16:06.573 --> 02:16:11.574]  Then it basically, hint, hint, talks about Stone running the show.
[02:16:13.174 --> 02:16:16.235]  Well, as Emperor Palpatine says, help me, I'm weak.
[02:16:16.275 --> 02:16:17.355]  Stone's not running anything.
[02:16:18.195 --> 02:16:19.496]  All right, let's go ahead now.
[02:16:19.516 --> 02:16:20.716]  He's not involved in anything.
[02:16:22.312 --> 02:16:22.592]  Yes sir.
[02:16:22.632 --> 02:16:26.594]  What I was going to talk about is kind of what's going on there in Europe.
[02:16:26.614 --> 02:16:27.054]  You know, Islam
[02:16:51.854 --> 02:16:53.775]  State that again, because I heard part of that.
[02:17:21.727 --> 02:17:29.750]  Okay, you know, liberal media blames America and Western countries for radical Islam.
[02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:32.091]  Yes, I got that part, absolutely, absolutely, yes.
[02:17:33.132 --> 02:17:40.255]  So, why aren't they attacking Islam for creating this Nazi groups that are rising up over there?
[02:17:40.655 --> 02:17:46.738]  You know, because it's said that one in four... Sure, look, look, it's all illogical, so I'm trying to reason with them.
[02:17:46.778 --> 02:17:49.179]  It's all just propaganda to a dumbed-down audience.
[02:17:50.481 --> 02:17:53.562]  Radical Islam has not been created by the West attacking over there.
[02:17:53.942 --> 02:17:54.782]  That's part of it.
[02:17:55.183 --> 02:18:10.167]  It's been part of the long-term expansionist, imperialistic, goonish nature of what Islam has turned into under the last few hundred years of its attempts to expand, which it happened when it first begun as well.
[02:18:10.227 --> 02:18:11.468]  So it's repeated history.
[02:18:12.188 --> 02:18:17.953]  Yes, going over and bombing the wrong countries and putting radicals in charge has made it worse.
[02:18:18.353 --> 02:18:22.816]  The West is exacerbating it, opening the door up to radical Islam to bring them in.
[02:18:22.856 --> 02:18:24.117]  You're absolutely right.
[02:18:25.298 --> 02:18:31.823]  And yeah, now it will give rise to a right-wing movement in Europe, which I would even call right-wing.
[02:18:31.843 --> 02:18:34.085]  The Nazis were socialist, but whatever.
[02:18:35.310 --> 02:18:43.796]  A very aggressive, nationalistic groups that the media will give attention to that will only then discredit legitimate nationalist groups.
[02:18:44.136 --> 02:18:44.857]  Great point, Gary.
[02:18:44.877 --> 02:18:45.497]  Good to hear from you.
[02:18:45.978 --> 02:18:47.639]  Charles in North Dakota.
[02:18:47.679 --> 02:18:48.259]  You're on the air.
[02:18:48.299 --> 02:18:48.619]  Go ahead.
[02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:50.461]  Yeah.
[02:18:50.481 --> 02:18:50.881]  Hey, Alex.
[02:18:50.901 --> 02:18:51.561]  What's going on?
[02:18:52.262 --> 02:18:54.423]  Worldwide transmission and I'm talking to Charles.
[02:18:55.724 --> 02:18:56.045]  Yeah.
[02:18:56.705 --> 02:18:58.907]  Hey, I just want to comment on a couple of things.
[02:18:59.087 --> 02:18:59.807]  I called the other day.
[02:18:59.847 --> 02:19:04.951]  I was one of the delegates going up to the convention that starts tomorrow in North Dakota, the state convention.
[02:19:06.204 --> 02:19:09.828]  Uh, Ted Cruz is going to be here tomorrow.
[02:19:10.528 --> 02:19:12.670]  Uh, well, not tomorrow, but Saturday, he's going to be speaking.
[02:19:12.710 --> 02:19:14.192]  And then we got Ben Carson coming in.
[02:19:14.292 --> 02:19:14.732]  I don't know.
[02:19:14.772 --> 02:19:19.877]  Word on Trump going to be here, but, uh, just wanted to comment that that's going to be going on.
[02:19:20.377 --> 02:19:20.918]  And, um,
[02:19:21.491 --> 02:19:29.239]  You know, I'm kind of curious to see, I want to say something to Ted Cruz, and I don't know, I'm going to be wearing my Info Wars shirt when I go down there for sure.
[02:19:29.259 --> 02:19:29.860]  That's awesome.
[02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:33.844]  I would just get his hand and say, you know, Senator Cruz, Senator Cruz, hey, hey, wow.
[02:19:34.705 --> 02:19:36.748]  Make him think that you're obviously into him, which you are.
[02:19:36.768 --> 02:19:37.869]  You were excited to talk to him.
[02:19:41.192 --> 02:19:42.453]  We're going to come back and talk about this.
[02:19:42.473 --> 02:19:43.113]  Stay there, Charles.
[02:19:43.133 --> 02:19:44.174]  This is an important question.
[02:19:44.635 --> 02:19:46.216]  And I'll bring a few more people with you.
[02:19:46.256 --> 02:19:48.037]  If you're going to go hard, go all the way.
[02:19:48.697 --> 02:19:51.299]  That way he gets peppered by the next question, the next question.
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:56.843]  And if they have tactics, he'll leap ahead about six people, thinking he may have friends next to you.
[02:19:57.104 --> 02:19:59.345]  Have their friends strung out strategically.
[02:19:59.746 --> 02:20:05.310]  And then we'll hit him with a few questions, and I'll think up and war game with you on the other side.
[02:20:05.770 --> 02:20:06.631]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:06.691 --> 02:20:07.871]  This is the Info War.

[02:20:39.261 --> 02:20:43.624]  Sharon Hunt, before using Heart and Body Extract, my energy level was very, very low.
[02:20:44.084 --> 02:20:46.966]  I could only walk a few feet and then would have to sit down.
[02:20:47.326 --> 02:20:56.152]  I was tired and lethargic, but after taking Heart and Body Extract, my energy level has improved greatly and I can now walk longer distances without getting tired so fast.

[02:21:11.846 --> 02:21:18.312]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[02:21:19.252 --> 02:21:22.035]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[02:21:22.855 --> 02:21:26.559]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[02:21:27.199 --> 02:21:28.460]  I said, let me see.
[02:21:29.021 --> 02:21:39.611]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[02:21:40.112 --> 02:21:51.242]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.

[02:22:16.124 --> 02:22:20.589]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.

[02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.911]  I think.
[02:23:08.453 --> 02:23:12.274]  Serious investors and traders want to make 81% return in 60 seconds?

[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:45.824]  If you want to raise the next generation of patriot leaders, take a look at Freedom Project Academy, a Judeo-Christian online school for kindergarten through high school.
[02:23:46.145 --> 02:23:48.646]  No common core teaching methods or high-stakes testing.

[02:24:04.915 --> 02:24:06.937]  That's FPEUSA.org.
[02:24:28.404 --> 02:24:29.464]  Welcome back, my friends.
[02:24:31.805 --> 02:24:34.145]  You know, my friends, I love this planet, our spaceship Earth.
[02:24:35.306 --> 02:24:40.767]  And there's more than 50,000 nuclear weapons on the Earth right now, enough to destroy it 10, 15 times over.
[02:24:40.827 --> 02:24:41.867]  That is the surface of the Earth.
[02:24:41.887 --> 02:24:45.828]  And I want to pledge something to you out there.
[02:24:48.569 --> 02:24:50.029]  I'm going to work as hard as I can.
[02:24:50.049 --> 02:24:53.890]  I'm going to do everything I can, because
[02:24:55.123 --> 02:25:09.637]  I'm not a suicidal lunatic, so I'm not a hero, to try to expose nuclear terrorism and the fact that globalists are clearly trying to get us ready for it, so they can absolutely re-engineer our society into a total police state.
[02:25:11.299 --> 02:25:19.246]  And we all need to work together to expose the fact that they're funding radical Islam, they're funding North Korea, they're funding all these enemies, they gave the Chinese communists all these weapons.
[02:25:20.512 --> 02:25:27.535]  Especially in the 90s under Clinton, so they can now menace us and threaten to attack our mainland.
[02:25:28.415 --> 02:25:33.177]  Chinese submarine, of course, famously launched a missile years ago off the West Coast.
[02:25:33.757 --> 02:25:39.179]  AFP reports China to US, be careful in South China Sea, remain militarily, go after you.
[02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:42.700]  No plans for killer U.S.
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:44.561]  military robots yet, AFP.
[02:25:44.981 --> 02:25:48.742]  China set to deploy largest range nuclear missile ever.
[02:25:49.142 --> 02:25:50.322]  Financial Times of London.
[02:25:52.322 --> 02:25:55.163]  North Korea threatening to nuke South Korea.
[02:25:55.923 --> 02:25:57.503]  This is what's going on in the real world.
[02:25:57.543 --> 02:25:58.684]  Then we've got Ted Cruz.
[02:26:00.604 --> 02:26:09.646]  Running around trying to convince everybody that he's this great patriot because he moved to Canada from Cuba and then he moved down to Texas six, seven years ago and got a cowboy hat.
[02:26:10.785 --> 02:26:14.226]  And since then, he has voted pro-gun and a few other things.
[02:26:14.246 --> 02:26:16.466]  He did vote for TPP and stuff like that.
[02:26:16.526 --> 02:26:17.787]  His wife helps write it.
[02:26:17.807 --> 02:26:21.027]  He says George Herbert Walker Bush is his ideological grandfather.
[02:26:21.047 --> 02:26:23.448]  And he got money from Goldman Sachs.
[02:26:23.508 --> 02:26:28.189]  And now he's been endorsed by George Herbert Walker Bush's family and Jeb Bush.
[02:26:28.229 --> 02:26:32.330]  And Neil and Marvin are running his campaign, got their hands in the cookie jar.
[02:26:33.370 --> 02:26:34.210]  He's very proud of that.
[02:26:34.570 --> 02:26:37.491]  So I'd tell Charles, I'd say, man, I tell you,
[02:26:38.257 --> 02:26:38.937]  Good to talk to you.
[02:26:39.697 --> 02:26:41.398]  I got a question about Jeb Bush.
[02:26:41.418 --> 02:26:45.439]  You know, he and his daddy and the rest of them were for NAFTA and GATT and open borders.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.621]  But you admit you worked for him, but now you're glad you got endorsed by him.
[02:26:52.821 --> 02:26:53.501]  No, wait a minute.
[02:26:54.481 --> 02:26:55.082]  No, slick.
[02:26:57.582 --> 02:27:00.963]  Pinocchio, Lion Ted, whatever your name is, answer my question.
[02:27:02.104 --> 02:27:07.205]  And then if he doesn't answer it, go, that's a coward right there who doesn't want to talk about his pedigree.
[02:27:09.329 --> 02:27:14.432]  Let me tell you, the Bushes knew, they'd already been in three times, they already knew that name was bad.
[02:27:15.052 --> 02:27:21.856]  So they laid down on their back about a decade ago and you know what came crawling out of the abyss of hell.
[02:27:24.917 --> 02:27:35.143]  Ted Cruz is the creation, the leavings, the Frankenstein monster of the Bushes.
[02:27:37.042 --> 02:27:38.462]  They got a bunch of people on their stable.
[02:27:38.503 --> 02:27:40.923]  Look, I don't care if somebody's Hispanic if they become president.
[02:27:41.223 --> 02:27:41.804]  I could care less.
[02:27:41.864 --> 02:27:43.084]  In fact, I'd love it if they were a patriot.
[02:27:43.624 --> 02:27:54.248]  But you got Marco Rubio and you got Ted Cruz with the CIA and the chosen, kosher, safe Hispanic to run for president and Jeb admitting he married a Hispanic lady.
[02:27:54.448 --> 02:27:55.269]  He's an attractive lady.
[02:27:55.489 --> 02:27:57.810]  But, you know, that's all part of the political dynasty.
[02:27:58.230 --> 02:28:06.435]  And they got George P. Bush in Texas, who's Hispanic, to bring back their dynasty and hope they can bring in enough Hispanics who will then vote for him to get him back into power.
[02:28:06.736 --> 02:28:10.998]  And that's all lying Ted is, is one more of these Frankenstein monsters.
[02:28:11.238 --> 02:28:13.420]  They got wound up back there in the laboratory.
[02:28:13.620 --> 02:28:15.701]  They want to roll out against the American people.
[02:28:15.941 --> 02:28:17.242]  And Cruz had a good voting record.
[02:28:17.502 --> 02:28:18.663]  I ignored some of his problems.
[02:28:18.883 --> 02:28:21.745]  But what I've seen him do now is very troublesome.
[02:28:22.895 --> 02:28:26.098]  So I've gone from 80% liking Cruz to 10% liking him.
[02:28:26.458 --> 02:28:29.600]  Now, if he got in as president and did good stuff, I'd turn around and support him.
[02:28:30.001 --> 02:28:31.622]  But the proof's in the pudding, Ted.
[02:28:32.683 --> 02:28:36.786]  When you're not busy saying you want to kill Donald Trump, you're busy supporting the TPP.
[02:28:36.846 --> 02:28:37.867]  Hell, your wife helped write it.
[02:28:38.207 --> 02:28:40.049]  Charles, does that sound like a pretty good question for you?
[02:28:41.390 --> 02:28:47.455]  Well, that's exactly what my question was going to be, was how can you tell me you're going to take down the criminal
[02:28:52.893 --> 02:29:00.395]  And yet your wife is the architect of the NAU, and you stand on all these globalist positions.
[02:29:00.675 --> 02:29:08.698]  You voted against trying to have any funding put down in Texas to build the wall, and we're supposed to believe, and then you want to increase H-1B visas by 500%.
[02:29:08.858 --> 02:29:11.899]  I mean, there's videos all over the web about this guy.
[02:29:12.259 --> 02:29:15.700]  And on top of that, I mean, he sent me eight emails in less than 24 hours.
[02:29:17.288 --> 02:29:25.113]  Well, they admit that he uses the same computer program, however he got it, that Obama had, that allows you to steal, basically, elections.
[02:29:25.393 --> 02:29:27.475]  They know when they're going to your door who you are.
[02:29:27.835 --> 02:29:29.536]  He's taken Texas, Ohio.
[02:29:29.976 --> 02:29:31.698]  He's been stealing a bunch of... Well, he didn't get Ohio.
[02:29:31.938 --> 02:29:33.419]  He's been stealing a bunch of different states.
[02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:37.441]  Louisiana, he admittedly lost, but still gets the delegates.
[02:29:39.298 --> 02:29:55.171]  Look, I don't like having to attack Ted Cruz, and I don't like seeing him turn out to be a Goldman Sachs, Bush, Loins, Sprung, Robo, Neocon, Next Wave, Globalist, Terminator, Hunter, Seeker, Operative.
[02:29:55.191 --> 02:29:56.312]  But that's what he is.
[02:29:56.812 --> 02:29:57.373]  Great points.
[02:29:57.393 --> 02:29:58.153]  Good luck, Charles.
[02:29:58.413 --> 02:29:59.354]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.815 --> 02:30:01.416]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.337 --> 02:30:05.059]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:05.159 --> 02:30:06.180]  Hunt him with a camera.
[02:30:06.220 --> 02:30:06.880]  Expose him.
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:07.381]  Hunt him.
[02:30:09.184 --> 02:30:24.849]  As the Supreme Court wrestles with whether or not it will compel nuns to buy abortion insurance, it should be a reminder of how absurd it is to trust our liberty to nine political appointees who believe the Constitution can be amended by their opinions.
[02:30:25.369 --> 02:30:31.111]  NBC News reports that a quarter of Republican senators now want to meet with Obama's Supreme Court nominee.
[02:30:31.531 --> 02:30:36.133]  Much has been said about Obama's nominee Merrick Garland's record opposing the Second Amendment.
[02:30:36.273 --> 02:30:42.376]  What hasn't been talked about is his long record of rubber-stamping any rule from any federal regulatory agency.
[02:30:42.596 --> 02:30:45.918]  Garland will be a reliable ally of the real government.
[02:30:46.458 --> 02:30:47.699]  Federal bureaucracies.
[02:30:47.979 --> 02:30:54.722]  With Scalia's death, the Supreme Court is expected to be deadlocked on Obama's EPA regulations to shut down the coal industry.
[02:30:55.042 --> 02:30:58.604]  The lower court, on which Garland now serves, will have the final say.
[02:30:59.284 --> 02:31:05.210]  He will take Scalia's place on this important issue, regardless of whether he takes Scalia's place on the court.
[02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:07.572]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:31:08.932 --> 02:31:09.553]  Uh, yeah.
[02:31:09.593 --> 02:31:15.337]  First of all, I want to say Secret 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[02:31:15.417 --> 02:31:16.298]  I use them all.
[02:31:16.358 --> 02:31:17.299]  They're phenomenal.
[02:31:17.359 --> 02:31:17.859]  They work.
[02:31:18.099 --> 02:31:18.860]  Buy them, folks.
[02:31:18.940 --> 02:31:19.420]  Thank you, brother.
[02:31:19.441 --> 02:31:21.322]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[02:31:21.662 --> 02:31:27.367]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[02:31:27.567 --> 02:31:29.488]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[02:31:29.549 --> 02:31:34.973]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar at the same time.
[02:31:35.413 --> 02:31:36.114]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[02:31:36.134 --> 02:31:39.997]  I buy all the NutraCynicals, DocuFX, Nascent Iodine.
[02:31:40.017 --> 02:31:40.777]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:31:40.817 --> 02:31:41.678]  Have they worked for you?
[02:31:41.838 --> 02:31:44.400]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[02:31:44.701 --> 02:31:45.761]  What products are you taking?
[02:31:46.042 --> 02:31:53.988]  Everything from Super Male to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[02:31:54.088 --> 02:31:57.531]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[02:32:08.635 --> 02:32:12.477]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from InfoWarsLives.com.
[02:32:12.797 --> 02:32:19.840]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[02:32:31.723 --> 02:32:39.285]  In the history of Infowarslife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[02:32:39.525 --> 02:32:48.847]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:32:49.187 --> 02:32:53.351]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:32:53.651 --> 02:33:00.376]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:33:00.717 --> 02:33:01.838]  That means it's clean.
[02:33:02.158 --> 02:33:03.259]  That means it's pure.
[02:33:03.339 --> 02:33:06.041]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:33:06.241 --> 02:33:07.903]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:33:16.912 --> 02:33:19.613]  Ted Cruz as a child wanted to be a ruler.
[02:33:21.093 --> 02:33:23.874]  And he wanted... well, other things.
[02:33:25.034 --> 02:33:27.235]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:33:27.715 --> 02:33:32.556]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:33:32.616 --> 02:33:43.478]  Well, my aspiration is to, uh... Oh, I don't know, be in a teen tit film like that guy who played Horatio.
[02:33:43.498 --> 02:33:45.439]  You know, he was in Malibu Bikini Beach Shop.
[02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:54.645]  Well, other than that, uh, take over the world, world domination, you know, rule everything, rich, powerful, that sort of stuff.
[02:33:57.868 --> 02:34:01.030]  And who does Ted Cruz now work for, who runs his campaign?
[02:34:02.871 --> 02:34:10.156]  We now see coming into view a new world order, where no small nations will stand in the way of our world government.
[02:34:12.577 --> 02:34:15.739]  Oh yeah, let's play Ted Cruz's dad talking about him becoming president.
[02:34:15.779 --> 02:34:16.439]  Let's back that up.
[02:34:16.479 --> 02:34:17.260]  I forgot that part.
[02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:18.681]  I apologize.
[02:34:18.701 --> 02:34:27.406]  I try to give folks a benefit of the doubt because you can work for Goldman Sachs and CFR and the Bushes and everything and then go against them.
[02:34:28.507 --> 02:34:34.911]  But when you say you now endorse them and they're going to run your campaign, they're more New World Order than Obama.
[02:34:36.132 --> 02:34:39.954]  Obama may be actually double-crossing and setting up some caliphate.
[02:34:39.974 --> 02:34:40.755]  I don't know what's worse.
[02:34:42.281 --> 02:34:43.622]  Let's go back to Ted Cruz's dad.
[02:34:43.662 --> 02:34:44.042]  Here it is.
[02:34:44.383 --> 02:34:45.984]  Cruz, you think Ted's going to rule the world one day?
[02:34:46.464 --> 02:34:46.985]  I hope not.
[02:34:47.405 --> 02:34:52.669]  All right, let's get serious here and go to Shelley in New Hampshire.
[02:34:52.689 --> 02:34:58.394]  Then we're going to go to Karen, James, Anthony.
[02:34:58.974 --> 02:35:00.416]  Oh, Keith's been holding a long time, too.
[02:35:00.836 --> 02:35:01.797]  Shelley in New Hampshire.
[02:35:01.837 --> 02:35:02.818]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:35:04.499 --> 02:35:04.899]  Hi.
[02:35:04.999 --> 02:35:06.300]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:35:06.721 --> 02:35:07.521]  First time caller.
[02:35:08.830 --> 02:35:10.892]  Well, thank you.
[02:35:10.912 --> 02:35:31.350]  I had a question about the 9-11 conspiracy and the 28 pages, and wondering if the 28 pages will reveal if there was actually a physical plane that crashed into Pennsylvania, and if there were actually people who were making those cell phone calls that is, you know, cannot be done.
[02:35:31.370 --> 02:35:36.074]  Who was making those let's roll calls, and where is the
[02:35:36.651 --> 02:35:38.874]  Sure.
[02:35:38.934 --> 02:35:43.819]  This is a very, very, very complex question.
[02:35:43.839 --> 02:35:47.223]  Do you want to hold for the answer, to come back and respond, or do you want to let go now?
[02:35:49.705 --> 02:35:50.947]  Okay, put her on hold.
[02:35:51.227 --> 02:35:52.148]  This will take a couple minutes.
[02:35:52.168 --> 02:35:54.390]  Let me try to really crystallize this.
[02:35:55.972 --> 02:35:58.615]  To understand 9-11, I have to explain it to you from my perspective.
[02:36:02.165 --> 02:36:13.571]  I learned that the establishment wanted us to debate all the anomalies and all the problems so they could confuse the public and then say which conspiracy is it because it's such a big mess.
[02:36:15.673 --> 02:36:22.096]  A whole bunch of FBI agents, it's on record, I made films about it, you can go back and pull the articles up if you're a new listener, but most people remember this.
[02:36:23.117 --> 02:36:30.741]  FBI agents from Texas to Arizona to Minnesota to Illinois to Florida to California, New York, you name it.
[02:36:32.461 --> 02:36:36.263]  Said they were ordered to not follow the hijackers and ordered to not stop them.
[02:36:37.824 --> 02:36:47.530]  The head of the visa section told Springman, who had been the previous head, that they were ordered to stand down and let them get fake passports or use their fake passports to get back into the U.S.
[02:36:47.550 --> 02:36:50.032]  and we're told they were actually working for the CIA.
[02:36:50.192 --> 02:36:54.775]  That's Mohammed Atta and the other 15 of the 19 hijackers out of Saudi Arabia.
[02:36:56.496 --> 02:36:59.098]  The other four came from other countries, Yemen and a few others.
[02:37:00.003 --> 02:37:03.364]  So that alone, there's a cover-up, the door's open, they're bringing them in.
[02:37:04.245 --> 02:37:08.666]  You get into bombs in Tower 1 and 2, in 7, absolutely.
[02:37:08.827 --> 02:37:09.747]  We don't know who did it.
[02:37:10.867 --> 02:37:12.528]  You get NORAD stand down.
[02:37:13.048 --> 02:37:14.729]  You get the happy hooligans.
[02:37:15.089 --> 02:37:20.151]  I mean, I talked to a retired Army colonel who was dead one week after he came on my show.
[02:37:23.872 --> 02:37:25.033]  Colonel Don DeGrimpre.
[02:37:29.321 --> 02:37:30.422]  And he said, who did it?
[02:37:30.883 --> 02:37:33.465]  That two AIM-9s were shot into Flight 93?
[02:37:34.967 --> 02:37:37.350]  That stuff came out like a decade later.
[02:37:38.050 --> 02:37:39.392]  I called him up a week later to get him back on.
[02:37:39.412 --> 02:37:41.614]  They said the Colonel died of a heart attack last night.
[02:37:43.756 --> 02:37:45.738]  Famous arms runner for the CIA, you name it.
[02:37:46.259 --> 02:37:47.881]  Huge, huge spook, guys.
[02:37:47.921 --> 02:37:48.241]  Huge.
[02:37:48.702 --> 02:37:49.823]  He was not going to be part of it.
[02:37:52.005 --> 02:37:59.069]  He came on and said, I met day after it happened with all these top retired generals and they called their sources and it was a happy hooligans.
[02:37:59.089 --> 02:38:05.212]  They had a secret reward ceremony, giving them medals just a few days after and they wouldn't refuse the order and shot it down.
[02:38:05.692 --> 02:38:11.996]  You could go on and on and on and on with 9-11.
[02:38:12.056 --> 02:38:16.498]  The whole thing is a black hole of lies.
[02:38:19.892 --> 02:38:22.575]  I mean, I made six, seven films on it, wrote books on the subject.
[02:38:22.915 --> 02:38:23.976]  It's ridiculous.
[02:38:25.618 --> 02:38:27.440]  But we know there was a stand down.
[02:38:27.940 --> 02:38:32.165]  The former head of transportation, Panetta, said he saw the order happen in the bunker.
[02:38:33.065 --> 02:38:36.729]  Cheney then ran to side R. Bush was running around scared at bunkers.
[02:38:36.889 --> 02:38:39.953]  He, from witnesses I know that were there with him, he seemed scared legitimately.
[02:38:40.213 --> 02:38:41.214]  So I say it was just a puppet.
[02:38:45.771 --> 02:38:47.652]  Saudi Arabia had control of the 15.
[02:38:48.052 --> 02:38:49.333]  The FBI was ordered not to stop them.
[02:38:49.373 --> 02:38:51.174]  Whatever once they got on the planes, we don't know.
[02:38:51.515 --> 02:38:54.296]  There were planes landing at NASA bases and planes taking off.
[02:38:54.596 --> 02:39:00.040]  Warren Buffett, for months, said, I'm going to have a very special meeting at this Air Force base in Nebraska.
[02:39:00.380 --> 02:39:10.146]  He had over several hundred top CEOs and leaders, thousands of people total, in a hangar with a big giant movie screen with messages from the White House.
[02:39:10.506 --> 02:39:12.827]  That came out in the news after, but they wouldn't say what it was.
[02:39:13.168 --> 02:39:15.229]  They were in the hangar before it happened.
[02:39:17.216 --> 02:39:21.882]  And the word is they told him, this is national security, we wanted to protect you and make sure you weren't in New York.
[02:39:22.302 --> 02:39:27.849]  Then they questioned him and it was in mainstream news that the Pentagon cancelled all these trips the day before to New York.
[02:39:30.151 --> 02:39:34.614]  See, they had a big secret government meeting on COG happening in New York set for 9-11.
[02:39:35.015 --> 02:39:38.477]  Then the conspirators went to people and said, the terrorists have learned of it.
[02:39:38.517 --> 02:39:39.818]  They may strike us tomorrow.
[02:39:40.439 --> 02:39:47.044]  They then got them all out in Nebraska to be part of the conspiracy to feel safe when they're actually meeting with the people that did it.
[02:39:47.264 --> 02:39:50.647]  Now that's as best I can break it down with tens of thousands of data points.
[02:39:51.047 --> 02:39:52.608]  Nobody studied it like I have, folks.
[02:39:52.648 --> 02:39:53.269]  I'm not bragging.
[02:39:53.549 --> 02:39:54.530]  It's just day one.
[02:39:54.810 --> 02:39:58.713]  I told you two months before it was coming, they were going to blow up the World Trade Center, blame it on bin Laden.
[02:40:00.478 --> 02:40:01.698]  I got all this news and loaded calls.
[02:40:01.778 --> 02:40:03.339]  It's just hard to get into.
[02:40:05.379 --> 02:40:10.300]  So, you notice the last six, seven years since I got more sophisticated, I don't really get into all the minutia.
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:16.021]  I mean, I cover it, I get into Building 7, I talk about a lot of the subjects, but we're meant to get lost in all that.
[02:40:16.461 --> 02:40:17.001]  Here's the deal.
[02:40:18.222 --> 02:40:28.784]  There was a congressional report in the first year after the event that found that Saudi Arabia ran the attacks, there was a NORAD-ordered stand-down from the White House, and that the Clintons and the Bushes were involved in it.
[02:40:30.031 --> 02:40:31.792]  And there is ongoing cover-up since then.
[02:40:32.132 --> 02:40:36.395]  That's enough to lock all these people up, open the investigation up, and then we learn everything.
[02:40:38.437 --> 02:40:43.360]  I have a pretty good idea of exactly what they did, but I'm not gonna sit there and speculate on it, okay?
[02:40:45.221 --> 02:40:47.683]  Now, separately, the media confuses that and goes,
[02:40:49.158 --> 02:40:50.059]  Do you believe Jones?
[02:40:50.119 --> 02:40:54.162]  He says the New York Fire Department blew the towers up, and he says that there is no radical Islam.
[02:40:54.843 --> 02:40:56.804]  The Fire Department were patriots, heroes.
[02:40:57.104 --> 02:40:59.686]  They're the ones that exposed it was an inside job from the ground.
[02:40:59.947 --> 02:41:00.948]  The police weren't involved.
[02:41:00.968 --> 02:41:01.648]  They were heroes.
[02:41:01.988 --> 02:41:02.709]  They exposed it.
[02:41:02.729 --> 02:41:06.352]  I've interviewed firefighters, police chiefs, deputy emergency managers' heads.
[02:41:06.372 --> 02:41:11.036]  I had Barry Jennings on, and one week after he was on, he was deader than a hammer.
[02:41:12.008 --> 02:41:14.529]  DC Madder, mad a month after Deader than a Hammer.
[02:41:14.950 --> 02:41:17.851]  You want me to really sit here and talk about Deader than a Hammer with you all day long?
[02:41:18.271 --> 02:41:20.673]  This is a spy movie you're watching in real time.
[02:41:21.013 --> 02:41:22.754]  They're just afraid to kill me to make me a martyr.
[02:41:25.355 --> 02:41:31.679]  And it ruins their fun, because they've done an analysis and an assessment on me and they know exactly where I'm coming from.
[02:41:32.419 --> 02:41:33.860]  Let's just say I ruin all the fun.
[02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:37.682]  Not just in that I don't care what they do to me because I'm committed to the truth.
[02:41:37.722 --> 02:41:39.343]  They know I ruin all the fun.
[02:41:40.086 --> 02:41:41.087]  From so many angles.
[02:41:41.948 --> 02:41:46.594]  Because I didn't come into this as some government operative or some super spy or some superman.
[02:41:47.115 --> 02:41:54.084]  But over the years, not connections, not things I'm doing, not people I'm talking to, it's an unwritten conspiracy against evil.
[02:41:57.395 --> 02:41:58.056]  It's a sink.
[02:41:58.476 --> 02:41:59.116]  It's a click.
[02:41:59.497 --> 02:42:00.397]  It's an understanding.
[02:42:00.717 --> 02:42:08.123]  With all these other people in government, in corporations, in other governments that don't like what happened and know what's happening as well.
[02:42:08.383 --> 02:42:22.813]  So I become a focal point of the knowledge and the understanding and a figurehead, a tarot card, an archetype, a logo, a symbol, a maxim, a standard, a fulcrum, a shield, a sword, a weapon.
[02:42:24.174 --> 02:42:26.956]  And what do you do to a weapon like this when you crush it?
[02:42:29.261 --> 02:42:30.963]  I'll use a cheesy comic book analogy.
[02:42:31.023 --> 02:42:33.045]  What happens when you attack Doomsday, huh?
[02:42:34.046 --> 02:42:34.887]  What happens when you do that?
[02:42:34.907 --> 02:42:36.789]  You just make me 100 times stronger each time.
[02:42:38.350 --> 02:42:39.352]  The enemy knows that.
[02:42:39.412 --> 02:42:40.933]  They understand the metaphysical rules.
[02:42:44.597 --> 02:42:45.758]  You don't think I'm naive.
[02:42:45.778 --> 02:42:48.961]  They have the Austin Police Department and the FBI watching out for my safety.
[02:42:50.233 --> 02:42:51.754]  Because they love me so much.
[02:42:51.974 --> 02:42:55.515]  They don't want me dead because of the chain reactions it could create.
[02:42:55.755 --> 02:42:59.137]  And I don't want to get off into all this, but to talk about 9-11 is to talk about myself.
[02:42:59.477 --> 02:43:00.917]  Because I've been in this since the very beginning.
[02:43:03.579 --> 02:43:10.341]  The public can't handle the full truth of 9-11 because it's not all sussed out and we don't know all the exact details.
[02:43:10.582 --> 02:43:12.162]  But we know there was a stand-down.
[02:43:12.462 --> 02:43:13.863]  We know Saudi Arabia ran it.
[02:43:14.323 --> 02:43:18.685]  We know that we then attacked Iraq, archenemies with them, and that was a war crime.
[02:43:22.341 --> 02:43:24.782]  And so, we're this close to the 28 pages coming out.
[02:43:25.042 --> 02:43:27.343]  We've already had Jones and others talk about what's in it.
[02:43:29.284 --> 02:43:31.905]  It confirms Panetta and others' stand-down order.
[02:43:32.586 --> 02:43:33.466]  It confirms it all.
[02:43:33.546 --> 02:43:34.487]  It's the beginning of the end.
[02:43:34.547 --> 02:43:37.188]  And it's just one symbol of their fall because...
[02:43:38.971 --> 02:43:43.933]  They've been killing and arresting and persecuting whistleblowers for about 10 years really bad.
[02:43:43.973 --> 02:43:46.935]  It's gotten really bad under Obama, but it was happening under Bush there at the end.
[02:43:47.115 --> 02:43:47.895]  Those guys are puppets.
[02:43:48.195 --> 02:43:52.177]  The decision was made about 2006 to start really going after people.
[02:43:52.797 --> 02:43:53.658]  It hasn't worked.
[02:43:53.718 --> 02:43:55.238]  More people are just saying, you know what?
[02:43:55.458 --> 02:43:55.939]  I'm done.
[02:43:56.579 --> 02:43:58.540]  I'm going public or I'm leaking this information.
[02:44:02.213 --> 02:44:28.503]  And that's why they want to go ahead and just have a civil war in this country, is because they want to get fellow Americans of every race, color, and creed killing each other, and thinking local government and local cops, or a random FBI agent, or a random ATF agent, or a random person in a government building is your enemy, and as if you're going to stop the New World Order, going with a rifle and shooting some people at the IRS, no you're not, don't do it, you couldn't do something worse to help the enemy.
[02:44:29.611 --> 02:44:32.533]  We are interfacing with everybody in the government.
[02:44:32.813 --> 02:44:34.594]  We're interfacing with the corporations.
[02:44:34.814 --> 02:44:36.515]  We're interfacing with the CEOs.
[02:44:36.715 --> 02:44:38.336]  We're interfacing with the foreign leaders.
[02:44:38.556 --> 02:44:39.957]  We're interfacing with the truth.
[02:44:41.038 --> 02:44:43.099]  And nothing on earth can stop it, and everybody knows that.
[02:44:46.058 --> 02:44:53.301]  So all they can hope for is a huge war, a huge civil war, a huge collapse that they hope diverts everybody.
[02:44:53.621 --> 02:44:54.681]  That's not going to work either.
[02:44:54.881 --> 02:44:56.322]  So the globals are kind of hesitating.
[02:44:56.682 --> 02:44:57.642]  They don't know what to do.
[02:44:57.682 --> 02:45:00.183]  They pulled a lot of really nasty tricks, but it's not working.
[02:45:00.943 --> 02:45:04.524]  They're like, sir, we've only got a few other options and they're super dangerous too.
[02:45:05.105 --> 02:45:06.385]  We recommend you don't do this.
[02:45:06.485 --> 02:45:08.026]  And the elite go, but we're stuck.
[02:45:08.066 --> 02:45:08.806]  We're already losing.
[02:45:10.199 --> 02:45:11.299]  We're telling you don't do it.
[02:45:11.319 --> 02:45:13.880]  And they're going, we've always been in control because we're bold.
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:15.540]  Go ahead with these plans.
[02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:16.540]  They're like, don't do it.
[02:45:16.580 --> 02:45:17.481]  You don't have the momentum.
[02:45:17.701 --> 02:45:18.541]  You don't have the people.
[02:45:19.361 --> 02:45:19.881]  Don't do it.
[02:45:19.901 --> 02:45:22.702]  But let me tell you, they're telling the elite, don't do it.
[02:45:24.082 --> 02:45:25.682]  Don't set off the nuke in New York.
[02:45:25.962 --> 02:45:27.303]  Don't set it off in Chicago.
[02:45:27.543 --> 02:45:28.803]  Don't set it off in Dallas.
[02:45:29.083 --> 02:45:30.223]  Don't set it off in Austin.
[02:45:30.243 --> 02:45:31.403]  I'm listing targets here, folks.
[02:45:31.984 --> 02:45:35.804]  Do not sit there and think they don't know.
[02:45:35.884 --> 02:45:38.625]  We are in a death battle with these people.
[02:45:41.980 --> 02:45:44.281]  And the elite are saying, they're getting their hands around our neck, what do we do?
[02:45:44.301 --> 02:45:47.802]  And their experts are going, I'll just try to, hope, just leave them alone, hope they turn loose.
[02:45:48.542 --> 02:45:51.684]  We're not turning loose, and you know that, because you're not turning loose either.
[02:45:52.204 --> 02:45:58.306]  You may consciously be trying to turn loose of us, but you're like a centipede, all your other feet and stingers are in our guts attacking us.
[02:45:58.646 --> 02:45:58.986]  You understand?
[02:45:59.226 --> 02:46:03.248]  You brought the fight, you attacked us, you want one, you're gonna get one.
[02:46:03.428 --> 02:46:04.128]  You understand that?
[02:46:04.408 --> 02:46:05.309]  It's a spiritual law.
[02:46:06.349 --> 02:46:08.250]  And I'm only one part of the manifestation of that law.
[02:46:08.410 --> 02:46:08.910]  We're coming!
[02:46:10.339 --> 02:46:11.660]  And a lot of people can't handle this.
[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:12.500]  Well, you know what?
[02:46:12.860 --> 02:46:13.780]  This planet's real.
[02:46:14.181 --> 02:46:15.081]  This struggle's real.
[02:46:15.281 --> 02:46:16.041]  Humanity's real.
[02:46:16.242 --> 02:46:16.982]  Free will's real.
[02:46:17.142 --> 02:46:17.902]  The spirit's real.
[02:46:19.863 --> 02:46:20.743]  And destiny's real.
[02:46:22.284 --> 02:46:25.405]  So nobody should be bored right now because this is a historic time.
[02:46:26.446 --> 02:46:28.907]  So Shelley, I don't know how to answer your question about 28 pages.
[02:46:28.967 --> 02:46:29.847]  It's known what's in them.
[02:46:30.428 --> 02:46:31.108]  It's been leaked.
[02:46:31.368 --> 02:46:32.849]  It's devastating info.
[02:46:33.189 --> 02:46:34.169]  That's the big domino.
[02:46:34.209 --> 02:46:35.550]  You knock that, all the others fall.
[02:46:37.557 --> 02:46:43.581]  Yeah, no, I get the gist of it, and you're right, it's not worth, you know, hashing up the details because it's the bigger picture.
[02:46:43.601 --> 02:46:44.602]  So, I get it.
[02:46:45.942 --> 02:46:54.628]  Well, I'm here to tell you the proudest thing I am is you can debate anything you want, but two months before 9-11, on the day of 9-11, Alex Jones hit that domino.
[02:46:54.948 --> 02:46:55.268]  Boom!
[02:46:57.190 --> 02:46:59.871]  That would have made my life worldwide right there for humanity.
[02:47:00.592 --> 02:47:03.494]  Iron my bones up one side and down the other on that day.
[02:47:04.054 --> 02:47:05.495]  Everything else after that's just gravy.
[02:47:06.115 --> 02:47:06.776]  Before my God.
[02:47:07.858 --> 02:47:09.639]  It's all my sins, and believe me, there are plenty of them.
[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:11.841]  I feel good at the final equation.
[02:47:12.342 --> 02:47:14.584]  Ma'am, what are you going to do to try to expose these monsters, Shelly?
[02:47:16.725 --> 02:47:19.788]  Hey, listen, I work every day at doing it.
[02:47:20.809 --> 02:47:28.855]  You know, I spread the word every day to people about your show, about vaccines, every day.
[02:47:30.094 --> 02:47:31.354]  You're a sweetheart and God bless you.
[02:47:31.374 --> 02:47:33.755]  And I tell you, there's a lot better souls out there than I am.
[02:47:33.795 --> 02:47:35.835]  When I talk about myself, it's because it's the journey I've had.
[02:47:36.235 --> 02:47:36.955]  You are the leaders.
[02:47:36.975 --> 02:47:37.676]  You are the future.
[02:47:38.036 --> 02:47:38.996]  You are unstoppable.
[02:47:39.516 --> 02:47:40.176]  And I salute you.
[02:47:40.196 --> 02:47:42.717]  All right, I want to go to Keith and then Karen.
[02:47:42.777 --> 02:47:44.057]  Keith in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:47:44.097 --> 02:47:44.477]  Go ahead.
[02:47:46.598 --> 02:47:47.378]  Hello, Alex.
[02:47:47.858 --> 02:47:50.798]  I'm going to go off the grid for a minute.
[02:47:51.339 --> 02:47:56.560]  I saw that you want to bring up the Bernie contest, the one contest I announced that I never followed up or actually did.
[02:47:56.820 --> 02:47:57.580]  And so we're going to do it.
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:57.820]  Go ahead.
[02:47:58.786 --> 02:48:00.707]  Dude, that was a stroke of brilliance.
[02:48:01.247 --> 02:48:09.930]  You are taking it to these people in ways, you've had some go viral, and you're seeing the results of it.
[02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:14.411]  I mean, that was a stroke of brilliance.
[02:48:14.471 --> 02:48:18.733]  I just threw it out on the air, and it's not brilliant, it's just, I say a lot of dumb stuff, so I'm going to say a few good things.
[02:48:19.053 --> 02:48:20.033]  What was the Bernie contest?
[02:48:20.053 --> 02:48:21.194]  Because I want to do the contest.
[02:48:21.594 --> 02:48:23.775]  That was a meme, I mean, what was the plan?
[02:48:23.795 --> 02:48:24.475]  Because we never did it.
[02:48:25.709 --> 02:48:37.402]  I mean, you announced a meme for the white privilege nonsense he'd put out that one time, and you've seen the results from it.
[02:48:39.382 --> 02:48:40.323]  You said it yourself.
[02:48:40.403 --> 02:48:42.204]  Look at the type of- Oh my gosh!
[02:48:42.264 --> 02:48:43.464]  I didn't wait for orders from headquarters.
[02:48:43.484 --> 02:48:43.845]  You're right.
[02:48:44.205 --> 02:48:46.626]  Buckley says we are now the number one memes on the internet for two weeks.
[02:48:46.946 --> 02:48:49.168]  We never even looked at our own contest info.
[02:48:49.408 --> 02:48:53.510]  That's people entering the contest to show white privilege and how ridiculous it was.
[02:48:53.770 --> 02:49:00.114]  I got so busy and forgot it, so we have to officially launch a new date, make the prize bigger, and have the Bernie Sanders meme contest.
[02:49:00.134 --> 02:49:07.678]  See, I'm just busy throwing hand grenades at enemy operations, and then I forget because I run to the next bunker what I blew up earlier or what you blew up earlier.
[02:49:08.058 --> 02:49:11.320]  So I was trying to remember that contest I announced, but never followed through on.
[02:49:11.540 --> 02:49:12.901]  The only one I ever failed on.
[02:49:12.941 --> 02:49:14.442]  We always pay out on these.
[02:49:14.482 --> 02:49:15.322]  We're just doing too much.
[02:49:15.342 --> 02:49:18.004]  So it was a Bernie Sanders meme contest, right?
[02:49:18.945 --> 02:49:19.265]  Yeah.
[02:49:19.505 --> 02:49:23.748]  And you know, you're hitting these guys on the level that they can understand.
[02:49:25.008 --> 02:49:27.910]  You know, you said yourself, look how they're dumbed down they are.
[02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:29.971]  They can only communicate through memes.
[02:49:30.712 --> 02:49:34.294]  Look, we got to start converting them one way or the other.
[02:49:34.855 --> 02:49:38.056]  At least get these brain-dead people thinking.
[02:49:39.556 --> 02:49:42.357]  And if they're listening, that's a start, correct?
[02:49:43.137 --> 02:49:43.577]  Absolutely.
[02:49:43.617 --> 02:49:46.898]  Well, I forgot why Buckley was showing me all these Bernie Sanders memes and stuff.
[02:49:47.318 --> 02:49:51.219]  There were some of the top memes, and I forgot that was our contest I ever followed through on.
[02:49:51.259 --> 02:49:55.380]  So I will codify it for the show, we will relaunch it, and we will follow through on that contest.
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:56.061]  That's a great idea.
[02:49:57.061 --> 02:49:58.341]  Well, it's your idea.
[02:49:58.361 --> 02:50:01.202]  That's why I said it was a stroke of genius, not that one other thing.
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:03.621]  How's Biggs doing?
[02:50:04.241 --> 02:50:07.082]  I'm not going to worry about it anymore unless he starts looking like a hipster.
[02:50:27.998 --> 02:50:28.758]  God bless you, brother.
[02:50:28.778 --> 02:50:29.579]  Good to hear from you, Keith.
[02:50:29.879 --> 02:50:34.680]  I'm going to come back and go to Karen, and James, and Anthony, and Jasmine, and others.
[02:50:35.060 --> 02:50:37.081]  And then we've got Anthony Gucciardi coming in to take over.
[02:50:38.061 --> 02:50:41.903]  I've not hit the Muslim news yet, and I love everybody on this planet.
[02:50:41.923 --> 02:50:43.963]  A lot of great people happen to be under the Muslim faith.
[02:50:44.663 --> 02:50:49.685]  But I tell you, what's taken Islam over is really about as bad as it gets.
[02:50:50.565 --> 02:50:54.707]  And the left has now merged with it, and I want to break that down briefly, too, when we come back.
[02:50:55.507 --> 02:51:05.855]  And even Italian liberals and French liberal designers are saying, why are all the new clothes designed hajjib, Muslim stuff, for Christians and people?
[02:51:05.895 --> 02:51:06.856]  What's going on here?
[02:51:07.456 --> 02:51:08.857]  Well, the left wants to kill the West.
[02:51:09.278 --> 02:51:11.319]  Investments in securities involves the risk of loss.
[02:51:11.479 --> 02:51:14.462]  The following is a far too common tale of investing in annuities.
[02:51:14.622 --> 02:51:21.487]  A successful couple invested a large portion of their savings in annuities, thinking they were a safe way to guarantee a dependable income stream, no matter what the market did.
[02:51:21.687 --> 02:51:23.728]  But it didn't take long for them to regret their decision.
[02:51:23.868 --> 02:51:30.050]  They were locked into low returns, faced potential tax consequences, and that they couldn't get out of their annuities without paying huge penalties.
[02:51:30.210 --> 02:51:31.791]  They were stuck, and so was their money.
[02:51:32.011 --> 02:51:34.292]  Suddenly, their retirement hopes and dreams were in danger.
[02:51:34.412 --> 02:51:36.993]  But it didn't have to happen to them, and it doesn't have to happen to you.
[02:51:37.273 --> 02:51:38.895]  You can avoid the annuity trap.
[02:51:39.075 --> 02:51:39.715]  Here's one way.

[02:53:08.763 --> 02:53:09.363]  This is Sharon Hunt.
[02:53:09.684 --> 02:53:13.105]  Before using Heart and Body Extract, my energy level was very, very low.
[02:53:13.566 --> 02:53:16.467]  I could only walk a few feet and then would have to sit down.
[02:53:16.807 --> 02:53:25.632]  I was tired and lethargic, but after taking Heart and Body Extract, my energy level has improved greatly and I can now walk longer distances without getting tired so fast.
[02:53:26.032 --> 02:53:27.433]  Thank you, Heart and Body Extract.

[02:54:24.901 --> 02:54:25.963]  I'm not going to belabor this.
[02:54:26.363 --> 02:54:28.787]  We have a new product at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:54:29.468 --> 02:54:35.216]  It is the Vitamin Mineral Fusion of minerals, trace elements, amino acids, all the vitamins.
[02:54:36.238 --> 02:54:38.441]  Super high quality natural organic sources.

[02:54:41.858 --> 02:54:43.400]  This is going to be a game-changing product.
[02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:45.741]  It's the first run of it, two years in the making.
[02:54:46.242 --> 02:54:48.303]  It's going to be available probably till Monday or Tuesday.
[02:54:48.343 --> 02:54:49.845]  There'll be a month till we get more in.
[02:54:50.825 --> 02:54:53.247]  It's going to have amazing reviews, I can tell you right now.
[02:54:54.028 --> 02:54:56.570]  It is concentrated, so even containers twice the size.
[02:54:57.330 --> 02:54:58.430]  I don't think so.
[02:55:15.396 --> 02:55:16.998]  And by tomorrow, it'll be back up for sale.
[02:55:17.318 --> 02:55:23.944]  We're augmenting and changing it, but it'll basically be the same with that limited edition Hillary for President shirt that looks like an election shirt.
[02:55:24.224 --> 02:55:26.647]  It was so popular, people have demanded it come back.
[02:55:26.687 --> 02:55:27.648]  Everybody's copying it.
[02:55:28.068 --> 02:55:32.572]  So we're changing it a little bit, so it'll still be limited edition, but basically it's coming back.
[02:55:32.893 --> 02:55:33.853]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:55:34.534 --> 02:55:36.136]  Okay, let's go back to your calls.
[02:55:36.156 --> 02:55:41.843]  Next little short segment, I'm going to play this bizarro clip of Hillary saying it's no big deal if she takes the popular vote.
[02:55:42.284 --> 02:55:45.909]  And the superdelegates right now, Karen in Arizona, thanks for holding.
[02:55:47.819 --> 02:55:49.680]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:54.281]  First of all, I would like to mention I'm taking your joint formula and it works very well.
[02:55:54.301 --> 02:55:54.721]  Thank you.
[02:55:55.061 --> 02:55:58.562]  And also, I like to give a little punch also on your silver bullet.
[02:55:58.702 --> 02:56:06.384]  Sometimes when I wake up with a stuffy nose in the morning, I put one or two drops of your silver bullet and it clears up my nose.
[02:56:07.227 --> 02:56:12.935]  That's what I do personally, is put it with salt, Epsom salt and hot water with a neti pot, and it's just amazing.
[02:56:13.215 --> 02:56:16.579]  I start getting a sore throat, I gargle with salt and stuff, then do a bunch of silver.
[02:56:16.679 --> 02:56:17.781]  It's been incredible.
[02:56:17.821 --> 02:56:19.563]  Thank you for the support.
[02:56:20.765 --> 02:56:23.288]  Also, I do have to reorder the joint.
[02:56:25.273 --> 02:56:32.897]  But I wanted to mention, I am a big Trump supporter, and I am planning on, I'm mailing my contribution to Roger Stone.
[02:56:33.457 --> 02:56:40.861]  But I am, what's your opinion on Jesse Benton, that he was named one of the superdelegates?
[02:56:41.282 --> 02:56:43.003]  I have some concerns about that.
[02:56:44.743 --> 02:56:52.288]  I don't want to be a mean person, and so I'm not going to say anything about Jesse Benton, but let's just say this, I have a concern.
[02:56:53.108 --> 02:56:54.729]  Who was he named as a superdelegate for?
[02:56:56.001 --> 02:56:56.642]  Donald Trump.
[02:56:59.369 --> 02:57:02.235]  Well, he's better than some of the Republican establishment people, but man, I...
[02:57:03.757 --> 02:57:05.918]  I'm just not going to sit there and... whatever.
[02:57:06.579 --> 02:57:07.439]  I have a concern too.
[02:57:07.799 --> 02:57:10.961]  And that's why everybody should be involved heavily in Cleveland.
[02:57:11.301 --> 02:57:14.083]  This is going to be just spectacularly wild.
[02:57:14.643 --> 02:57:16.364]  This is like a real movie, folks.
[02:57:16.384 --> 02:57:18.345]  This is like something out of a movie and then some.
[02:57:18.966 --> 02:57:20.267]  And so I was not aware of that.
[02:57:21.387 --> 02:57:23.969]  But because Ron Paul is not... I like Ron Paul.
[02:57:23.989 --> 02:57:26.410]  He's not supporting Trump because of some of the purist views.
[02:57:26.430 --> 02:57:28.992]  And I know Benton has done some other things.
[02:57:29.072 --> 02:57:32.474]  But, you know, I guess Benton's better than like Mitch McConnell's people.
[02:57:32.514 --> 02:57:32.794]  I don't know.
[02:57:34.573 --> 02:57:57.279]  Also, I have a friend named Gary, and if you want information off the line, he lives in Texas, and he is a delegate also, but he won't be able to go to the superdelegate, and he told me that he stopped just by two votes to have them from voting on the delegate level in Texas through the die-vote machines.
[02:57:57.816 --> 02:57:58.056]  Wow.
[02:57:58.416 --> 02:58:00.117]  Yeah, major election fraud in Texas.
[02:58:00.157 --> 02:58:03.079]  Even the election board said that it looks like Cruz got robbed.
[02:58:03.139 --> 02:58:04.420]  I mean, look, he won Louisiana.
[02:58:04.560 --> 02:58:05.920]  They gave it to Ted Cruz.
[02:58:06.441 --> 02:58:08.001]  But yes, we'll put you on hold.
[02:58:08.021 --> 02:58:10.023]  We want to hear from delegates, superdelegates.
[02:58:10.123 --> 02:58:12.704]  We're going to really be focusing heavily on this.
[02:58:13.304 --> 02:58:14.985]  Bernie Sanders is being robbed as well.
[02:58:15.265 --> 02:58:21.929]  He was winning those first states, so they would just give the delegates to Hillary and tell her supporters on CNN, they'd say, just give up.
[02:58:21.969 --> 02:58:22.649]  Your vote doesn't count.
[02:58:22.669 --> 02:58:23.290]  Hillary's got it.
[02:58:23.590 --> 02:58:25.191]  So most of them started switching to Hillary.
[02:58:25.951 --> 02:58:30.093]  Creating a self-fulfilling prophecy where she now is winning a lot of the popular vote.
[02:58:30.753 --> 02:58:31.814]  I thought we had a clip of it coming up.
[02:58:31.854 --> 02:58:32.474]  Thank you, Karen.
[02:58:33.214 --> 02:58:35.696]  Let's go to Luke in Tennessee.
[02:58:35.716 --> 02:58:36.456]  Who's been holding the longest?
[02:58:36.476 --> 02:58:37.516]  No, James in Texas.
[02:58:38.837 --> 02:58:40.398]  Then Caesar in Mexico.
[02:58:40.418 --> 02:58:43.719]  We'll talk about Jasmine, Luke, and everybody else.
[02:58:44.100 --> 02:58:47.621]  We got Luke, who's a Tennessee Democrat, voting for Trump.
[02:58:48.041 --> 02:58:49.682]  Tennessee Democrat, isn't that Davy Crockett?
[02:58:50.342 --> 02:58:50.763]  We'll be back.
[02:58:50.783 --> 02:58:51.183]  Stay with us.
[02:58:51.843 --> 02:58:55.565]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[03:00:13.323 --> 03:00:16.244]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:20.546 --> 03:00:22.507]  Here's a clip of Hillary Clinton
[03:00:23.925 --> 03:00:26.807]  She doesn't think superdelegate system is inappropriate.
[03:00:27.127 --> 03:00:30.088]  Here she is trying to confuse the viewers of MSNBC.
[03:00:30.568 --> 03:00:48.898]  To be clear on this issue of superdelegates versus delegates, the Republican Party really wishes they had superdelegates right now because they'd love to have some manifestation of the establishment worries about their frontrunner that they could throw a big part of the nominating process back basically to the party and take it away from the voters.
[03:00:50.699 --> 03:00:54.263]  Do you make a distinction between the different kinds of delegates that the Democrats have?
[03:00:54.323 --> 03:00:58.487]  I mean, are superdelegates an inappropriate thing in terms of the process?
[03:00:58.507 --> 03:01:01.629]  That there are these party leaders and elected officials who can make such a big difference?
[03:01:02.070 --> 03:01:03.751]  Well, I have more popular votes.
[03:01:04.172 --> 03:01:06.354]  And I have more pledged delegates.
[03:01:06.814 --> 03:01:12.279]  And we have a system in our party that was set up before I decided to run.
[03:01:12.299 --> 03:01:12.820]  That's enough.
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:13.560]  That's enough.
[03:01:14.355 --> 03:01:16.416]  Man, I should have played that earlier and played that all day.
[03:01:16.456 --> 03:01:18.938]  Maybe Anthony will play it again coming up and he'll continue with your calls.
[03:01:18.958 --> 03:01:20.038]  I'm going to take a few right now.
[03:01:22.079 --> 03:01:23.540]  They didn't change it until the 70s.
[03:01:23.560 --> 03:01:25.101]  They didn't dare try it until now.
[03:01:26.101 --> 03:01:27.262]  There is a popular vote.
[03:01:27.302 --> 03:01:28.202]  It's under state law.
[03:01:28.243 --> 03:01:29.323]  People think they're voting.
[03:01:29.603 --> 03:01:30.424]  It's going to be counted.
[03:01:31.124 --> 03:01:32.725]  There is real fraud here.
[03:01:33.085 --> 03:01:34.206]  This is false advertising.
[03:01:34.726 --> 03:01:41.990]  You cheated early on when you were losing to steal the delegates to then say you were ahead to swing people to now vote for you.
[03:01:44.502 --> 03:01:51.484]  And so to see Maddow going, hey, is this kind of weird, you know, that party officials have so much power and change votes?
[03:01:53.405 --> 03:01:55.286]  And then Hillary just acts like, hey, it's not me.
[03:01:55.446 --> 03:01:56.206]  I mean, wow.
[03:01:57.086 --> 03:02:01.628]  That's how you come home and somebody's kidnapping your five-year-old and you're like, what are you doing?
[03:02:01.728 --> 03:02:04.149]  Oh, I'm just taking them to, you know, McDonald's with me.
[03:02:04.169 --> 03:02:06.530]  And you got your hand, you know, over their mouth and everything.
[03:02:06.590 --> 03:02:07.410]  It's just crazy.
[03:02:08.305 --> 03:02:08.945]  Hey there, Alex Jones.
[03:02:08.965 --> 03:02:09.486]  First time caller.
[03:02:09.526 --> 03:02:11.286]  Been hearing you for about 8 years.
[03:02:11.306 --> 03:02:12.687]  It's an honor to be on the show.
[03:02:12.727 --> 03:02:14.248]  I have some points I want to cover.
[03:02:29.622 --> 03:02:30.182]  Thank you so much.
[03:02:30.242 --> 03:02:30.882]  I have two points.
[03:02:30.902 --> 03:02:32.083]  I want to be as brief as possible.
[03:02:32.483 --> 03:02:33.363]  I'm living in Mexico.
[03:02:33.383 --> 03:02:35.264]  I've been here about 10 years now, almost.
[03:02:35.884 --> 03:02:37.765]  And I grew up in the United States, as a matter of fact.
[03:02:37.885 --> 03:02:40.385]  And I'm right now pursuing a career here in Mexico.
[03:02:40.405 --> 03:02:46.827]  But what I want to get at is I have been seeing how the NWO agenda has been infiltrating Mexico.
[03:02:46.887 --> 03:02:48.388]  There are two points real fast.
[03:02:48.488 --> 03:02:48.748]  One is
[03:02:49.568 --> 03:03:05.174]  In May 25th of this year, they want to try to pass a law which prohibits or limits the freedom of religious organizations in the aspect of, like, evangelizing, you know, like propaganda in religious organizations.
[03:03:05.194 --> 03:03:09.396]  So they're trying to pass a law in the House of Senates in the state of Mexico.
[03:03:10.319 --> 03:03:19.268]  And they're saying that, you know, religious organizations have to stop being so insistent when it comes to quote-unquote evangelizing.
[03:03:19.449 --> 03:03:22.872]  Oh yeah, that's part of the UN deal, part of the World Council of Churches.
[03:03:23.353 --> 03:03:24.394]  I was aware that was going on.
[03:03:24.414 --> 03:03:28.358]  I didn't know that it was in the Federal Senate of Mexico, or is this a state trying to do it?
[03:03:29.952 --> 03:03:38.719]  No, it's actually the federal, yeah, because here... Wow, wow, that's a big story, because that's happening all over the world, and I bet money I know which organization's behind that.
[03:03:38.759 --> 03:03:41.401]  The old pope wants to shut down his competition.
[03:03:41.502 --> 03:03:42.002]  Amazing.
[03:03:42.362 --> 03:03:47.266]  And so, tell us the name of it or a news headline, because I want to look this up and cover it.
[03:03:49.028 --> 03:03:52.050]  I don't have it on right now, but I can give you it in a moment.
[03:03:52.070 --> 03:03:53.712]  I don't have it, it's in my tablet.
[03:03:53.752 --> 03:03:55.053]  Sure, well that's going on all over the place.
[03:03:55.073 --> 03:03:55.793]  We'll look into it.
[03:03:56.154 --> 03:03:56.834]  What was the other point?
[03:03:58.325 --> 03:03:59.766]  Yeah, another point is this, it's amazing.
[03:03:59.826 --> 03:04:03.349]  It was about, remember when Ratzinger, Pope Ratzinger was Pope.
[03:04:03.910 --> 03:04:09.495]  He came here approximately, I don't remember, time just goes by so fast I don't remember, it was like five years ago or something.
[03:04:09.575 --> 03:04:11.937]  Pope Ratzinger came, four years ago maybe.
[03:04:12.337 --> 03:04:16.461]  He came to visit one of the big cities here in Mexico and this is crazy.
[03:04:16.781 --> 03:04:18.563]  I have a client where I work.
[03:04:19.266 --> 03:04:21.808]  He's a lawyer, and he teaches law.
[03:04:22.308 --> 03:04:23.669]  He gave me an inside scoop.
[03:04:23.689 --> 03:04:28.832]  He writes articles for a local newspaper, and he explained to me, you know, in private, he said, you know what?
[03:04:29.313 --> 03:04:40.400]  The Pope, he's trying, in his visit here, he's trying to push a law, and to get in, you know, to get in accordance with the government leaders here, to make a tie, look at this, a tax,
[03:04:41.215 --> 03:04:50.543]  That a tax, an extra tax for all the citizens here in Mexico, and that tax would go as a tithe or an offering to the Vatican Church.
[03:04:50.623 --> 03:04:52.845]  And I couldn't believe it, but thankfully they didn't pass it.
[03:04:52.885 --> 03:04:54.927]  Oh yeah, well that's what the Catholic Church used to do.
[03:04:54.967 --> 03:04:56.428]  All those countries had to pay that.
[03:04:56.829 --> 03:05:00.892]  You also had to give the Pope personally money or he wouldn't get your family out of purgatory.
[03:05:01.833 --> 03:05:02.334]  Amazing.
[03:05:02.354 --> 03:05:03.955]  Yeah, no, I'm actually aware of that.
[03:05:04.035 --> 03:05:07.218]  Although this Pope is one of the richest guys in the world.
[03:05:07.638 --> 03:05:08.099]  He's amazing.
[03:05:09.588 --> 03:05:13.269]  The New York Daily News says, maybe the system really is rigged.
[03:05:13.729 --> 03:05:14.189]  You think?
[03:05:14.649 --> 03:05:23.391]  The Democrat paper came to this conclusion after contacting Democrat superdelegates in New York and asking if they would switch from Hillary to Bernie if he won the popular vote.
[03:05:23.991 --> 03:05:26.031]  Every single superdelegate said no.
[03:05:26.631 --> 03:05:32.152]  Just like the Republican establishment with its Never Trump movement, the Democrat establishment is Never Bernie.
[03:05:32.513 --> 03:05:34.133]  Welcome to crony socialism.
[03:05:34.853 --> 03:05:40.378]  Democrats should ask themselves why they want a crooked, rigged system to control everything.
[03:05:40.838 --> 03:05:43.761]  Crony capitalism can't happen without crony socialism.
[03:05:44.614 --> 03:05:46.375]  In the GOP, they steal it differently.
[03:05:46.875 --> 03:05:49.156]  There, they wait until after the election to steal it.
[03:05:49.236 --> 03:05:57.179]  Like in South Carolina, where the voters gave Trump every delegate, but Cruz came in later with the establishment and appointed his friends as delegates.

[03:07:10.749 --> 03:07:11.769]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:07:11.970 --> 03:07:13.410]  Rob Due joins us.
[03:07:13.551 --> 03:07:16.372]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:07:16.672 --> 03:07:17.733]  Tell us what BrainForce did.
[03:07:17.753 --> 03:07:18.694]  I've been working all day.
[03:07:18.714 --> 03:07:21.015]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:07:21.175 --> 03:07:22.476]  I get in here at 830.
[03:07:22.596 --> 03:07:24.237]  I was kind of run down.
[03:07:24.517 --> 03:07:26.298]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[03:07:26.458 --> 03:07:28.319]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:07:28.339 --> 03:07:30.140]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[03:07:30.160 --> 03:07:30.941]  I popped two of them.
[03:07:31.221 --> 03:07:33.342]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[03:07:33.502 --> 03:07:35.383]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:07:35.443 --> 03:07:36.744]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:07:36.964 --> 03:07:37.985]  People really love it.
[03:07:38.285 --> 03:07:38.805]  Read about it.
[03:07:38.886 --> 03:07:42.628]  Find out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[03:07:42.728 --> 03:07:47.991]  Because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:07:48.171 --> 03:07:52.053]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:07:52.213 --> 03:07:58.016]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:07:58.356 --> 03:08:04.279]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:08:15.479 --> 03:08:16.320]  Oh, that's good music.
[03:08:18.041 --> 03:08:18.861]  Robert Plant, baby.
[03:08:19.401 --> 03:08:23.564]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:08:23.584 --> 03:08:25.785]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:26.165 --> 03:08:29.267]  Yeah, before I was married, I sometimes had long-distance relationships.
[03:08:29.407 --> 03:08:30.748]  Girlfriends in Dallas, you name it.
[03:08:31.168 --> 03:08:31.528]  Houston.
[03:08:32.869 --> 03:08:35.710]  And there was something about that long drive to go meet the woman.
[03:08:36.631 --> 03:08:40.113]  Especially as it got dark, and the lights, and the song just describes it.
[03:08:40.673 --> 03:08:41.674]  Just builds on it.
[03:08:42.592 --> 03:08:46.934]  That relationship is so special, that's why they're attacking families, attacking the very species.
[03:08:47.395 --> 03:08:50.416]  The globalists might as well be aliens from deep space, they hate us that much.
[03:08:50.937 --> 03:08:53.078]  They are literally here to overwrite our culture.
[03:08:53.478 --> 03:09:03.784]  I didn't get to this, Anthony Gucciardi is, the political correctness, University of North Carolina, diversity workshop, brands Band-Aids as white privilege.
[03:09:05.106 --> 03:09:09.911]  Okay, just make everything racist except the globalists stealing all of our basic liberties and freedom.
[03:09:10.191 --> 03:09:11.172]  He's going to go to your calls too.
[03:09:11.233 --> 03:09:12.814]  Jasmine in California, Trump supporter.
[03:09:12.834 --> 03:09:15.737]  We're going to go to Luke in Tennessee, Democrat voting for Trump.
[03:09:16.118 --> 03:09:18.640]  James in Texas, new vitamin supplement ideas.
[03:09:18.660 --> 03:09:18.740]  800-259-9231.
[03:09:18.760 --> 03:09:19.081]  800-259-9231.
[03:09:19.101 --> 03:09:20.502]  Anthony is taking over.
[03:09:27.139 --> 03:09:38.346]  CJ walked in and said, hey, you never played the video you've been promoting, and I forget the exact title, Meet the Dumb Butts, says something else, that hate Trump.
[03:09:38.366 --> 03:09:41.608]  If you're a radio listener, it's pretty powerful, but I kind of need to narrate it.
[03:09:41.888 --> 03:09:43.749]  For TV viewers, you can obviously see this.
[03:09:45.530 --> 03:09:48.312]  These people, I don't put them down to feel good about myself.
[03:09:48.792 --> 03:09:49.913]  They're scary dumb.
[03:09:49.953 --> 03:09:53.495]  They're like, Saudi Arabia is executing people that are gay.
[03:09:54.175 --> 03:09:55.236]  Well, it's wrong.
[03:09:55.356 --> 03:09:56.577]  They should execute everyone.
[03:09:58.134 --> 03:10:01.215]  They didn't even understand, because it's always about equality, equality.
[03:10:01.715 --> 03:10:04.036]  Like, chop your legs off if somebody else is in a wheelchair.
[03:10:04.856 --> 03:10:08.058]  It's like, can't say mother and father if somebody else doesn't have a mother and father.
[03:10:10.818 --> 03:10:13.379]  Well, not all the Saudis are like that.
[03:10:13.699 --> 03:10:17.341]  The point is they're totalitarian, not Donald Trump.
[03:10:18.436 --> 03:10:20.177]  So, that's what we're getting at.
[03:10:20.917 --> 03:10:21.997]  And so I want to play this clip.
[03:10:22.017 --> 03:10:22.938]  There's a bunch of others.
[03:10:22.978 --> 03:10:31.881]  We've got Rob Dew and we've got Travis Knight and Michael Zimmerman out there on the road following the people attacking Trump and the other side of the equation.
[03:10:32.161 --> 03:10:34.682]  The Trump people are all real scared of media and won't talk to the camera.
[03:10:34.983 --> 03:10:37.303]  But once they do, they're pretty informed.
[03:10:37.343 --> 03:10:41.045]  Now, about one in six or seven, maybe one in five, is an InfoWars listener.
[03:10:41.940 --> 03:10:45.282]  Which scares me, because somebody must be bootlegging t-shirts.
[03:10:45.322 --> 03:10:46.303]  I'm not selling that many.
[03:10:46.563 --> 03:10:47.944]  And anywhere we go, we see them.
[03:10:48.004 --> 03:10:51.326]  So, I guess it's our listeners or the politically active people, that's why this is happening.
[03:10:51.346 --> 03:10:53.088]  So, bravo to everybody out there.
[03:10:53.688 --> 03:10:54.389]  We salute you.
[03:10:54.989 --> 03:10:57.250]  Anthony Gucciardi is here about to take over.
[03:10:57.611 --> 03:10:59.152]  The new Vitamin Mineral Fusion is in.
[03:10:59.192 --> 03:11:00.653]  It will sell out by Monday or Tuesday.
[03:11:01.133 --> 03:11:03.195]  Take advantage of it at Infowarslife.com.
[03:11:03.575 --> 03:11:05.076]  And you are the folks that built Infowars.
[03:11:05.416 --> 03:11:09.159]  Nightly News is coming up tonight, 7 o'clock Central as well, with the rest of our great crew.
[03:11:09.839 --> 03:11:10.439]  But before I...
[03:11:11.300 --> 03:11:13.901]  Hand the baton over, let's just go ahead and go to this video.
[03:11:14.702 --> 03:11:18.924]  And then coming up, we also have Kingdom Games, the passion of Christian entertainment.
[03:11:19.324 --> 03:11:22.526]  And the reason I like this Jakari Jackson report, and I meant to get to it earlier...
[03:11:23.669 --> 03:11:32.995]  Is there's big articles out from Bloomberg, CNS today about Christian films aren't just dominating like The Passion of the Christ six, seven years ago with a billion plus domestically.
[03:11:33.355 --> 03:11:34.056]  They're taking over.
[03:11:34.456 --> 03:11:37.918]  Christian, libertarian, conservative films to niche markets are good.
[03:11:38.379 --> 03:11:39.119]  They're informative.
[03:11:39.619 --> 03:11:41.881]  And when the rest of Hollywood's in trouble, they're making money.
[03:11:43.294 --> 03:11:55.817]  So it's an example of vote with your dollars for hardcore liberty media, for people that tell the truth, for culture, for non-GMO food, for organic, for good nutraceuticals, whatever it is, while there's still a tiny bit of free market.
[03:11:57.718 --> 03:12:03.619]  Getting involved with that, having free choice, will displace all of the garbage.
[03:12:05.179 --> 03:12:07.220]  So whether you love Christians or not, that's not the issue.
[03:12:08.260 --> 03:12:15.806]  When you support something, when you create a culture, when you back that culture, if it is better, it will supplant the previous forced culture.
[03:12:16.346 --> 03:12:17.687]  So that's coming up as well.
[03:12:18.548 --> 03:12:19.729]  Very, very important report.
[03:12:19.929 --> 03:12:33.059]  But let's go to some of the events there in Appleton, Wisconsin yesterday that Rob Dew witnessed where actual social justice warriors kept coming over and saying, you're a white male, you're not allowed to speak.
[03:12:34.019 --> 03:12:34.599]  No, you know what?
[03:12:34.699 --> 03:12:41.823]  It's those same people that came that are putting food on your table, vegetables and everything else, because you do not- I grow my own food.
[03:12:41.883 --> 03:12:43.123]  Hey, check yourself, dude.
[03:12:43.163 --> 03:12:48.686]  Patriarchy runs the world, so check your white male privilege.
[03:12:49.426 --> 03:12:49.646]  Okay.
[03:12:49.686 --> 03:12:50.367]  Check yourself.
[03:12:50.407 --> 03:12:50.567]  What?
[03:12:50.587 --> 03:12:51.947]  What are you going to go on with?
[03:12:52.027 --> 03:12:53.348]  Are you a social justice warrior?
[03:12:53.368 --> 03:12:55.049]  Are you some kind of white knight now?
[03:12:55.069 --> 03:12:57.210]  You're going to come to say- No, I'm not claiming to be a white knight.
[03:12:57.310 --> 03:12:59.971]  All right, well, I'm talking to her.
[03:13:04.629 --> 03:13:10.571]  I'm a Trump supporter, but we can still get along.
[03:13:31.038 --> 03:13:32.078]  America loves again!
[03:13:32.138 --> 03:13:34.139]  You tell us to love everybody?
[03:13:34.159 --> 03:13:40.022]  What you're doing is you're harassing the people that are standing in this line to go to this event.
[03:13:40.102 --> 03:13:40.863]  That's right.
[03:13:40.923 --> 03:13:41.243]  Okay?
[03:13:41.463 --> 03:13:49.848]  We're not, you know, if you want to love everybody, you wouldn't start these kind of things.
[03:13:49.908 --> 03:13:52.489]  You wouldn't carry a sign that's just going to make people mad.
[03:13:52.649 --> 03:13:54.530]  We're supporting the people that we love.
[03:13:54.590 --> 03:13:56.691]  We're here trying to stand up for what we believe in.
[03:13:56.751 --> 03:13:57.692]  Why do you love the Democrats?
[03:13:57.732 --> 03:13:59.353]  What is going on with the Democrats?
[03:13:59.773 --> 03:14:02.735]  This is not political.
[03:14:02.955 --> 03:14:05.396]  This is not with a political party.
[03:14:05.516 --> 03:14:15.502]  I'm here because I'm supporting students of color at Lawrence and the people of color in America and in Appleton and all around that are not, that feel threatened, that don't feel safe because of this exact kind of gathering.
[03:14:15.562 --> 03:14:19.424]  He's trying to build a wall to block out Mexicans.
[03:14:20.404 --> 03:14:21.105]  Why is that?
[03:14:21.165 --> 03:14:21.705]  No, no, no.
[03:14:21.765 --> 03:14:24.087]  He's not trying to build a wall to block out Mexicans.
[03:14:24.127 --> 03:14:28.209]  He's trying to build a wall to block out, to secure the border.
[03:14:28.965 --> 03:14:30.086]  That's a phony!
[03:14:30.266 --> 03:14:31.527]  Yes he is!
[03:14:31.627 --> 03:14:32.427]  That's a phony!
[03:14:32.507 --> 03:14:33.188]  Yes he is!
[03:14:33.228 --> 03:14:35.849]  But first, let me take a selfie.
[03:14:36.510 --> 03:14:37.950]  That's a phony!
[03:14:38.451 --> 03:14:39.091]  Yes he is!
[03:14:39.251 --> 03:14:40.332]  That's a phony!
[03:15:04.009 --> 03:15:05.529]  Did you hear Saudi Arabia today?
[03:15:05.889 --> 03:15:07.610]  They want to have the death penalty for gay people.
[03:15:07.650 --> 03:15:08.270]  What do you think of that?
[03:15:09.190 --> 03:15:10.230]  I do not support that.
[03:15:10.571 --> 03:15:16.312]  I think if you're going to have the death penalty, you can't just limit the death penalty to a certain group of people.
[03:15:16.332 --> 03:15:19.833]  If you're going to have the death penalty, fine.
[03:15:19.853 --> 03:15:20.953]  It has to be for everyone.
[03:15:20.973 --> 03:15:22.334]  It can't just be for a certain group of people.
[03:15:23.965 --> 03:15:25.066]  Wrong!
[03:15:33.990 --> 03:15:35.191]  What news network are you from?
[03:15:35.211 --> 03:15:35.911]  I'm just curious.
[03:15:35.931 --> 03:15:36.992]  It says Infowars right here.
[03:15:37.872 --> 03:15:38.713]  Dump Trump!
[03:15:38.893 --> 03:15:39.753]  Dump Trump!
[03:15:39.913 --> 03:15:40.754]  Dump Trump!
[03:15:40.934 --> 03:15:41.694]  Dump Trump!
[03:15:41.774 --> 03:15:43.255]  The quickest way to clear out a protest.
[03:15:43.275 --> 03:15:44.616]  Y'all have a good one.
[03:15:44.636 --> 03:15:45.356]  Thank you.
[03:15:45.636 --> 03:15:46.357]  What do we want?
[03:15:46.457 --> 03:15:47.377]  Equality!
[03:15:47.557 --> 03:15:49.258]  But first, let me take a selfie.
[03:15:55.796 --> 03:16:00.618]  But first let me take a selfie.
[03:16:23.956 --> 03:16:26.846]  Hey, if you- I mean, you can- Do not interrupt me!
[03:16:26.886 --> 03:16:28.130]  Do not interrupt me!
[03:16:28.210 --> 03:16:29.976]  Do not interrupt me!
[03:16:45.657 --> 03:16:50.001]  Oh, now you're going to play the... So you're a Miss Andrews, got it, alright.
[03:16:50.041 --> 03:16:51.382]  Miss Andrews doesn't exist!
[03:16:51.422 --> 03:16:52.823]  Miss Andrews doesn't exist?
[03:16:53.163 --> 03:16:53.863]  You hate men!
[03:16:53.924 --> 03:16:58.387]  Let's see the men talking down to me, please!
[03:16:58.727 --> 03:17:01.469]  That's the same thing I do to him as I do to you!
[03:17:01.789 --> 03:17:03.230]  I gotta go!
[03:17:03.310 --> 03:17:04.011]  I gotta go!
[03:17:04.091 --> 03:17:06.333]  Love, not hate!
[03:17:06.413 --> 03:17:07.774]  Love, not hate!
[03:17:16.148 --> 03:17:17.329]  We're good.
[03:17:27.552 --> 03:17:28.473]  All right, there we go.
[03:17:28.493 --> 03:17:31.596]  There's the video ending with a nice slow clap.
[03:17:32.516 --> 03:17:37.040]  Definitely an interesting summary of some of the anti-Trump protesters.
[03:17:37.160 --> 03:17:50.092]  And to me, the craziest part about all of it is that, look, I could argue on both sides of the equation intellectually, not saying I'm the smartest person in the world or the most researched, but I could at least bring some points up.
[03:17:50.632 --> 03:17:54.215]  The thing that kills me is when people just throw out buzzwords.
[03:17:54.295 --> 03:18:04.324]  They throw out loaded buzzwords they've heard on the news, or they've read online, and they say something like, well, you know, he's hateful, he's a bigot, he's whatever it is.
[03:18:04.344 --> 03:18:06.166]  And this could be about anyone, not just Trump.
[03:18:06.426 --> 03:18:10.850]  And you say, well, give me some real solid reasons to back up what you're saying.
[03:18:11.150 --> 03:18:12.411]  I had this conversation the other day.
[03:18:12.431 --> 03:18:15.133]  And what's funny is, I'm not even claiming sides.
[03:18:15.894 --> 03:18:18.255]  I'm saying give me a solid reason.
[03:18:18.316 --> 03:18:20.937]  Give me give me an example of what you're talking about.
[03:18:21.337 --> 03:18:24.699]  And they'll say something like, well, you know, he's a he's a racist.
[03:18:25.540 --> 03:18:26.841]  OK, well, give me an example.
[03:18:26.881 --> 03:18:28.121]  Do you what about his policies?
[03:18:28.141 --> 03:18:29.522]  Do you agree with his policies?
[03:18:30.463 --> 03:18:31.804]  And this is on both sides.
[03:18:32.004 --> 03:18:40.629]  My problem is I could go to one of those rallies and if they asked me, I could for either side argue some policy that I support.
[03:18:41.009 --> 03:18:44.992]  I could argue some things that he said specifically that I'm for or against.
[03:18:45.572 --> 03:19:00.266]  And it just blows my mind, and I think it's going back hundreds of years in intellectual evolution when it has turned into just screaming, like, buzzwords at each other and labeling things to where we can't even have a real discussion anymore.
[03:19:00.887 --> 03:19:06.372]  And it's one thing if you could say, well, you know, that's a small percentage of the population and they go to these rallies.
[03:19:06.633 --> 03:19:08.414]  No, the media has adopted this now.
[03:19:09.255 --> 03:19:17.301]  Because of the clickbait style headlines that go down in the news today, they also just put things in the headlines because they know that people don't read the stories.
[03:19:17.782 --> 03:19:30.492]  So they just put things in the headlines like bigots, hate, racist, all that kind of stuff, when the funniest thing about it is the media is most of the time the ones that are the purveyors of hatred and the ones fueling the fire.
[03:19:30.772 --> 03:19:32.714]  And that's why we're going to talk about this article.
[03:19:33.374 --> 03:19:40.437]  University of North Carolina Diversity Workshop brands beige band-aids as white privilege, and I've got some things to say about that.
[03:19:40.457 --> 03:19:52.964]  We're also going to talk about a story you're not going to hear in the mainstream media, apparently, and that is about the FBI and Department of Justice investigating a joint investigation into a massive global bribery racket of the oil industry.
[03:19:52.984 --> 03:19:55.285]  That and a lot more, and some videos coming up.
[03:19:55.325 --> 03:19:55.925]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:55.985 --> 03:19:56.885]  This is The Fourth Hour.
[03:19:56.925 --> 03:19:57.746]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:20:09.369 --> 03:20:19.960]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:20:20.281 --> 03:20:24.185]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:20:24.425 --> 03:20:26.267]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:26.607 --> 03:20:32.053]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:20:32.213 --> 03:20:42.000]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:20:42.240 --> 03:20:48.504]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:20:48.744 --> 03:20:52.047]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:20:52.067 --> 03:20:53.908]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:20:54.148 --> 03:20:57.090]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:20:57.270 --> 03:20:59.411]  Heart and body extract gets results.

[03:21:08.853 --> 03:21:10.874]  Investments in securities involves the risk of loss.
[03:21:11.054 --> 03:21:14.015]  The following is a far too common tale of investing in annuities.
[03:21:14.175 --> 03:21:21.057]  A successful couple invested a large portion of their savings in annuities, thinking they were a safe way to guarantee a dependable income stream no matter what the market did.
[03:21:21.257 --> 03:21:23.319]  But it didn't take long for them to regret their decision.
[03:21:23.439 --> 03:21:29.644]  They were locked into low returns, faced potential tax consequences, and that they couldn't get out of their annuities without paying huge penalties.
[03:21:29.784 --> 03:21:31.385]  They were stuck, and so was their money.
[03:21:31.585 --> 03:21:33.867]  Suddenly, their retirement hopes and dreams were in danger.
[03:21:33.987 --> 03:21:36.569]  But it didn't have to happen to them, and it doesn't have to happen to you.
[03:21:36.849 --> 03:21:38.470]  You can avoid the annuity trap.

[03:22:11.846 --> 03:22:18.312]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[03:22:19.252 --> 03:22:22.035]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:22:22.855 --> 03:22:26.539]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:22:27.199 --> 03:22:28.440]  I said, let me see.
[03:22:29.020 --> 03:22:39.604]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:22:40.084 --> 03:22:51.229]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.

[03:23:13.275 --> 03:23:14.156]  Are you ready?
[03:23:14.396 --> 03:23:17.056]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[03:23:17.156 --> 03:23:19.337]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[03:23:19.517 --> 03:23:22.998]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?

[03:23:38.344 --> 03:23:43.589]  Just add water and your family is eating delicious food instead of fighting for scraps in a food riot.
[03:23:43.749 --> 03:23:44.410]  Try it free.
[03:23:44.610 --> 03:23:49.494]  Order a no-obligation free sample meal delivered right to your front door and for a limited time.
[03:23:49.534 --> 03:23:49.914]  We're good.
[03:24:18.943 --> 03:24:25.790]  Alright, so I've got a bunch of news here and some of it is so absurd that it feels like I'm reading The Onion.
[03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:29.053]  But I'm not reading The Onion and we're gonna have to get to all of it.
[03:24:29.514 --> 03:24:39.444]  One of them is of course the University of North Carolina Diversity Workshop that rates students based on their white privilege and they talk about beige band-aids.
[03:24:39.904 --> 03:24:41.446]  They have you do a score from 0 to 5.
[03:24:42.887 --> 03:24:47.492]  How privileged you are and how like racist you are and just the total absurdity of it.
[03:24:47.512 --> 03:24:48.954]  So we're going to talk about that in a second.
[03:24:49.354 --> 03:24:50.075]  Another story.
[03:24:50.095 --> 03:24:54.861]  So I had one earlier about this chair that people are buying.
[03:24:54.881 --> 03:24:57.183]  I sent all this over to you guys as well.
[03:24:58.284 --> 03:24:59.165]  Back in the studio there.
[03:24:59.285 --> 03:25:05.167]  So this chair is designed to hug you so that you feel like someone is comforting you and maybe someone loves you.
[03:25:05.868 --> 03:25:08.109]  And I was just going to talk about that in the state of our culture.
[03:25:08.129 --> 03:25:13.511]  And this is from really South Korea, which it's much worse in some ways over there in certain circumstances.
[03:25:13.591 --> 03:25:14.872]  But Alex showed me this one.
[03:25:15.252 --> 03:25:18.414]  Children now spend less time outside than the average prisoner.
[03:25:19.696 --> 03:25:21.017]  A prisoner in their own home.
[03:25:21.277 --> 03:25:24.479]  They spend less time outside than the average prisoner.
[03:25:24.519 --> 03:25:34.506]  So we're going to talk about that, and we're going to talk about this oil racketeering, um, bribery racket investigation the FBI and the DOJ is on.
[03:25:34.746 --> 03:25:36.888]  This is from the Age slash Huffington Post.
[03:25:49.856 --> 03:25:52.600]  Man, who knew there might be some fishy stuff going on with the oil industry.
[03:25:52.640 --> 03:25:53.581]  That is just wacky.
[03:25:54.122 --> 03:26:01.672]  No, but it's a big deal right now on Reddit that none of the major news companies, CNN, Fox, etc., are covering this story, so we're going to talk about it.
[03:26:02.108 --> 03:26:03.728]  And then Leanne also is going to join us.
[03:26:04.008 --> 03:26:05.749]  Leanne McAdoo is going to join us in the next segment.
[03:26:05.769 --> 03:26:12.551]  I was coming in here to host the show and she told me she had some really, really good news, powerful news that coincided with what we're talking about today.
[03:26:12.591 --> 03:26:14.011]  So I said, hey, jump on and show us.
[03:26:14.071 --> 03:26:15.671]  And she said she's got some really good stuff.
[03:26:16.011 --> 03:26:22.213]  But first, before the long segment coming up, I want to get to some of these calls because they sound very interesting.
[03:26:22.813 --> 03:26:24.574]  So I want to jump to Luke in Tennessee.
[03:26:24.594 --> 03:26:26.694]  He says he's a Democrat voting for Trump.
[03:26:27.574 --> 03:26:30.235]  Now, Luke, first tell me what is on your mind here.
[03:26:32.168 --> 03:26:34.050]  Well, I'm actually a very short time listener.
[03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:35.211]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:26:36.352 --> 03:26:42.097]  And I got to tell you, I'm very impressed with you guys overall with Alex, and I'm impressed with how sharp your audience is.
[03:26:42.317 --> 03:26:44.219]  I mean, I'm absolutely genuinely impressed.
[03:26:45.020 --> 03:26:46.601]  And I like how you guys push Trump.
[03:26:48.543 --> 03:26:49.124]  Well, you know, thanks.
[03:26:49.184 --> 03:26:51.646]  I'm always happy to be invited to join the show here.
[03:26:51.666 --> 03:26:52.647]  And look,
[03:26:53.959 --> 03:27:02.744]  My question to you is, so you say you're a Democrat who's supporting Trump, and I actually haven't even said I'm supporting anyone, but let me ask you this.
[03:27:02.845 --> 03:27:18.274]  Does it shock you to see the anti-Trump protesters, what I was speaking about earlier, not talking about specific things, not talking about specific policy concerns or any form of intellectual discussion, just screaming racist, screaming bigot, just screaming buzzwords?
[03:27:18.294 --> 03:27:19.495]  I mean, what do you think about that?
[03:27:21.246 --> 03:27:30.471]  Well, yeah, and just for full disclosure, my mother actually was a longtime supporter of MoveOn.org, which she no longer, you know, is a part of.
[03:27:30.512 --> 03:27:37.055]  But I can tell you that as far as that, you don't see, I mean, everybody's going to tell you that you don't see these type of protests.
[03:27:37.075 --> 03:27:42.699]  You don't see Trump protesters doing this at a Hillary Clinton rally, but it's deeper than that.
[03:27:43.259 --> 03:27:48.062]  I mean, what's funny about it is if the Trump campaign managers would actually
[03:27:48.644 --> 03:27:51.247]  Maybe call their rallies job fairs?
[03:27:51.927 --> 03:27:54.009]  These people wouldn't even be there, first of all.
[03:27:55.270 --> 03:27:56.692]  You know, something like that, but...
[03:27:57.150 --> 03:28:01.654]  But what's funny about it, you said something earlier about that there's no substance.
[03:28:01.714 --> 03:28:03.816]  These people are so into the buzzwords.
[03:28:03.836 --> 03:28:18.309]  You could, you know, you could probably write an article that said Trump is a racist, smacks African-American woman, and then the body of the article could be about the calorie count in cornflakes, but they would never see that.
[03:28:18.749 --> 03:28:20.170]  You're so right, you're so right.
[03:28:20.230 --> 03:28:22.011]  And that is the power of the media.
[03:28:22.671 --> 03:28:23.772]  That's the power of the media.
[03:28:23.812 --> 03:28:26.913]  Even though they are losing control of the narrative, people are smart.
[03:28:27.154 --> 03:28:28.614]  People really are smart, okay?
[03:28:28.874 --> 03:28:30.575]  People really, really deep down are smart.
[03:28:30.595 --> 03:28:38.620]  They're just, a lot of them are busy, they're worn down, they're tired, and they don't have time to read the 600 words in the body of the article.
[03:28:38.760 --> 03:28:43.683]  And sometimes the body of the article is deceiving too, because it'll repeat the headline, and then it'll get down into the minutiae.
[03:28:43.903 --> 03:28:47.645]  And sometimes it's not until the last paragraph where you can actually read what's going on.
[03:28:48.385 --> 03:28:49.766]  But I totally hear you.
[03:28:49.886 --> 03:28:56.450]  And the funny thing is, I mean, I would discount this if it were Trump supporters saying, you know, doing the same thing to Hillary.
[03:28:56.490 --> 03:29:01.133]  It's just it's almost Orwellian to where it's newspeak.
[03:29:01.253 --> 03:29:03.515]  You can't talk and speak in full sentences.
[03:29:03.795 --> 03:29:11.960]  You have to just scream loaded establishment PC style buzzwords and then get mad when someone responds to you.
[03:29:12.301 --> 03:29:12.641]  The best
[03:29:12.941 --> 03:29:25.885]  To me, and I want to get your thoughts on this too before we head to break, is when you ask someone like that an intellectual question, well what do you think about, you know, such and such and the F you, screw you, you know, you're racist, it's like whoa!
[03:29:26.145 --> 03:29:30.506]  And they can get away with that though, because they say you triggered them, and they say you're racist.
[03:29:30.526 --> 03:29:32.047]  What do you think about that as we go to break?
[03:29:32.427 --> 03:29:33.087]  Final comment.
[03:29:33.287 --> 03:29:34.648]  Yeah, I mean, exactly.
[03:29:34.668 --> 03:29:36.868]  It's very, it's the easiest thing to do now.
[03:29:37.148 --> 03:29:38.789]  I mean, that's the new hit thing.
[03:29:39.489 --> 03:29:48.837]  But, you know, maybe kind of bordering on that, one thing that I would like for everybody to know is that you see these type of people, you know, they're probably professional students.
[03:29:48.917 --> 03:29:49.377]  You know what?
[03:29:49.557 --> 03:29:50.158]  Hold your point.
[03:29:50.178 --> 03:29:50.858]  We're going to come back to you.
[03:29:50.878 --> 03:29:51.599]  We've got a head to break.
[03:29:51.619 --> 03:29:52.220]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:52.240 --> 03:29:54.081]  This is the Alex Jones Show fourth hour.
[03:29:54.101 --> 03:29:55.302]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:29:58.304 --> 03:29:59.185]  We're on the march.
[03:29:59.686 --> 03:30:01.287]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.208 --> 03:30:04.910]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.076 --> 03:30:11.517]  Going out and protesting Islamophobia?
[03:30:11.557 --> 03:30:13.318]  Guess what you've probably been looking for.
[03:30:13.479 --> 03:30:17.321]  Sharia-friendly social networks for Muslims are now on the rise.
[03:30:17.521 --> 03:30:18.021]  Hooray!
[03:30:18.301 --> 03:30:20.923]  Article up by Forbes.com.
[03:30:21.103 --> 03:30:33.409]  A month ago, while attending the Startup Turkey conference in Antalya, I had the chance to talk to Shoaib Fadi, CEO and co-founder of the social networking platform, now get ready, this is the best part, Muslim Face.
[03:30:33.469 --> 03:30:36.131]  Muslim Face is going to be used to help combat Islamophobia.
[03:30:36.331 --> 03:30:37.572]  Created by Donald Trump.
[03:30:37.752 --> 03:30:41.174]  Definitely not created by that racist title called Muslim Face.
[03:30:41.294 --> 03:30:43.356]  You look like you could probably be a member of Muslim Face.
[03:30:43.496 --> 03:30:45.357]  Hey, what gave you that idea?
[03:30:45.537 --> 03:30:46.918]  Well, you kind of look like a Muslim.
[03:30:47.058 --> 03:30:57.646]  He was there to pitch to potential investors his website, which also offers prayer times, job postings, a tool to locate your nearest mosque, and another button to help find your spouse.
[03:30:58.026 --> 03:31:02.289]  Now, it might not be seeing the best of times to write about Islamic online content.
[03:31:02.429 --> 03:31:04.590]  You just named your website Muslim Face.
[03:31:04.770 --> 03:31:05.551]  Come on, man.
[03:31:05.751 --> 03:31:08.473]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.

[03:32:12.118 --> 03:32:13.658]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:32:13.839 --> 03:32:17.800]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:32:17.840 --> 03:32:20.441]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.

[03:32:48.385 --> 03:33:00.357]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[03:33:00.397 --> 03:33:07.345]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life
[03:33:16.388 --> 03:33:19.929]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:33:20.469 --> 03:33:22.230]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:25.791 --> 03:33:26.571]  All right, we're back.
[03:33:27.052 --> 03:33:28.052]  It's the bottom of the hour.
[03:33:28.172 --> 03:33:29.312]  Leanne McAdoo's in here.
[03:33:29.352 --> 03:33:32.873]  She's got some really powerful news she's going to share with us in a moment.
[03:33:33.494 --> 03:33:36.675]  But first, we're going to go back to the caller who was finishing his point.
[03:33:36.695 --> 03:33:40.936]  We're going to talk about children now spend less time outside than the average prisoner.
[03:33:41.216 --> 03:33:42.597]  So they're prisoners in their own home.
[03:33:42.617 --> 03:33:43.157]  And then we wonder,
[03:33:43.777 --> 03:33:47.059]  Gee, for 80 years, depression rates have just been skyrocketing.
[03:33:47.099 --> 03:33:48.240]  That's really absurd.
[03:33:48.300 --> 03:33:49.801]  Why are the youth so depressed?
[03:33:49.861 --> 03:33:50.722]  It just makes no sense.
[03:33:50.942 --> 03:33:52.183]  They're not going outside.
[03:33:52.483 --> 03:33:54.004]  They're having their dreams crushed.
[03:33:54.305 --> 03:34:03.831]  They're being placed into this facade where you have to go to school, get in debt, work a 9-to-5 that you hate, and basically pay taxes until you die.
[03:34:04.132 --> 03:34:05.152]  Why are they so depressed?
[03:34:05.192 --> 03:34:06.313]  That's so strange.
[03:34:06.353 --> 03:34:07.134]  That's so weird.
[03:34:07.734 --> 03:34:09.235]  So we're going to go to this call here in a second.
[03:34:09.255 --> 03:34:17.039]  I'd also like to comment that the first thing Leanne says, not just about her news, is the comment on my face being nice and shiny today.
[03:34:17.059 --> 03:34:20.762]  That's because I'm trying out a new product that we may be launching soon.
[03:34:20.802 --> 03:34:21.882]  It's a secret formula.
[03:34:22.423 --> 03:34:22.903]  So anyway...
[03:34:23.443 --> 03:34:38.929]  Alright, we're gonna go to Luke in Tennessee who's finishing up his point about the ridiculousness of the anti-whatever protesters, whatever it is, that they just scream buzzwords, they can't have an intellectual conversation when you talk to them, you say, well what about, you know, this event or that event?
[03:34:39.209 --> 03:34:40.470]  They just say, you're a racist!
[03:34:41.030 --> 03:34:41.510]  F you!
[03:34:42.011 --> 03:34:43.571]  It's crazy.
[03:34:43.971 --> 03:34:44.912]  So Luke, finishing up.
[03:34:47.253 --> 03:34:48.153]  Go ahead Luke, what's your point?
[03:34:48.173 --> 03:34:49.554]  Yes sir, can you hear me?
[03:34:49.814 --> 03:34:50.274]  Absolutely.
[03:34:51.129 --> 03:34:54.151]  Okay, so finishing up, I was thinking about it.
[03:34:54.591 --> 03:35:05.479]  You know, in like the big shopping malls, the franchise malls, all throughout the United States, maybe like a Simon Mall, for example, you see these signs that says, do not group up in larger than five or six people.
[03:35:05.519 --> 03:35:06.119]  Have you seen those?
[03:35:06.620 --> 03:35:07.060]  Yes.
[03:35:07.340 --> 03:35:08.921]  I have not, but I believe you.
[03:35:08.941 --> 03:35:10.282]  Go ahead.
[03:35:10.302 --> 03:35:15.266]  The reason they do that is so gangs of people, not racially speaking, just speaking in general,
[03:35:16.264 --> 03:35:20.526]  They know how destructive... But see, let me stop you right there.
[03:35:20.566 --> 03:35:22.007]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[03:35:22.728 --> 03:35:26.009]  You just got a sense of the verbal domination.
[03:35:26.710 --> 03:35:29.171]  Because you said gangs, you said not racially.
[03:35:29.751 --> 03:35:29.931]  Right?
[03:35:29.972 --> 03:35:33.013]  Because, think about that for a minute.
[03:35:33.053 --> 03:35:35.294]  I don't think you're implying any type of race in this.
[03:35:35.595 --> 03:35:38.876]  But it's just like we're told band-aids are racist and white privilege.
[03:35:39.156 --> 03:35:41.918]  The funny thing to me is, I'm not racist.
[03:35:42.438 --> 03:35:43.279]  I'm not sexist.
[03:35:44.099 --> 03:35:45.580]  I am about human empowerment.
[03:35:46.161 --> 03:35:48.402]  I genuinely want everyone to succeed.
[03:35:49.363 --> 03:35:50.944]  I do not think in those ways.
[03:35:51.525 --> 03:35:56.549]  But the problem is when you take children and you have them sit down, you say, you see, this is a black person.
[03:35:56.589 --> 03:35:57.550]  This is a white person.
[03:35:57.590 --> 03:35:58.210]  This is a male.
[03:35:58.250 --> 03:35:58.871]  This is a female.
[03:35:59.091 --> 03:36:00.792]  They're different, but they're not OK.
[03:36:00.992 --> 03:36:02.433]  And if you think they're different, you're bad.
[03:36:02.674 --> 03:36:03.394]  They're the same.
[03:36:03.614 --> 03:36:03.975]  You got it.
[03:36:03.995 --> 03:36:04.735]  But they look different.
[03:36:04.915 --> 03:36:05.696]  And you got to like that.
[03:36:05.776 --> 03:36:06.577]  And they're like, wait, what?
[03:36:06.617 --> 03:36:07.678]  I didn't even think about this.
[03:36:08.038 --> 03:36:09.599]  My friend has different color skin.
[03:36:09.659 --> 03:36:10.500]  I didn't even think about it.
[03:36:10.580 --> 03:36:12.802]  Or my friend is, you know, my friend is a female.
[03:36:12.842 --> 03:36:14.363]  And they're like, well, those are females.
[03:36:14.683 --> 03:36:15.144]  They're different.
[03:36:15.164 --> 03:36:16.224]  But you better not think they are.
[03:36:16.244 --> 03:36:17.085]  And you're like, wait, what?
[03:36:17.445 --> 03:36:17.626]  What?
[03:36:17.646 --> 03:36:18.807]  Or we're all the same.
[03:36:18.827 --> 03:36:21.669]  We're all equal until you try to wear my culture's hairstyle.
[03:36:21.709 --> 03:36:22.249]  And it's like it.
[03:36:22.269 --> 03:36:23.010]  I'm going to attack you.
[03:36:23.030 --> 03:36:24.971]  Yeah, it's like maybe we're having a discussion with Leanne.
[03:36:24.992 --> 03:36:29.895]  And I'm like, yeah, I was hanging out with my friend, you know, and she, but not in a sexist way.
[03:36:29.935 --> 03:36:31.397]  Like, she's just not, you know, it's like.
[03:36:31.437 --> 03:36:32.097]  Just a friend.
[03:36:32.177 --> 03:36:32.838]  It's just a friend.
[03:36:32.878 --> 03:36:34.079]  Like, oh, like.
[03:36:34.259 --> 03:36:34.879]  We've already all.
[03:36:35.660 --> 03:36:36.740]  We've all been brainwashed.
[03:36:36.760 --> 03:36:38.041]  We all police our language.
[03:36:38.441 --> 03:36:41.882]  It's absurd because I know that you didn't mean it in that sense.
[03:36:42.182 --> 03:36:44.503]  And it's kind of like it's been said before.
[03:36:44.563 --> 03:36:46.384]  This isn't my analogy, but it's a beautiful one.
[03:36:46.784 --> 03:36:50.305]  If you're out in the middle of nowhere, you're driving your car and there's a stop sign.
[03:36:50.625 --> 03:36:53.426]  OK, not I'm not telling you to break the law.
[03:36:53.526 --> 03:36:53.726]  No.
[03:36:54.126 --> 03:36:57.107]  But if you were to just blitz through that stop sign, you know, it's totally safe.
[03:36:57.428 --> 03:36:59.668]  You feel something go in the bottom of your gut, don't you?
[03:36:59.788 --> 03:37:03.350]  Every time you break the law, you feel something like, oh, like a control, right?
[03:37:03.390 --> 03:37:03.890]  Like a fear.
[03:37:04.770 --> 03:37:07.551]  That is an invisible domination.
[03:37:07.791 --> 03:37:08.792]  And I'm not saying you should break the law.
[03:37:08.812 --> 03:37:09.792]  I'm not saying it's bad.
[03:37:09.832 --> 03:37:14.374]  I'm just saying that it's a form of control over you.
[03:37:14.574 --> 03:37:17.175]  You've been brought up your entire life that doing that is bad.
[03:37:17.615 --> 03:37:23.757]  So now the new form of control is you better not be racist, you better not be sexist, you better not be intolerant, you better not be a bigot or whatever.
[03:37:24.057 --> 03:37:29.579]  So we are spending a percentage of our ability, our capacity to express ourselves policing ourselves.
[03:37:29.859 --> 03:37:30.960]  That's never happened before.
[03:37:31.300 --> 03:37:39.506]  We are literally policing ourselves for these psychological, weird control freaks, instead of them doing it for us.
[03:37:39.566 --> 03:37:40.447]  Isn't that insane?
[03:37:40.767 --> 03:37:42.428]  Right, instead of just being able to say what you want.
[03:37:42.508 --> 03:37:45.330]  It is because you end up with some kind of robot.
[03:37:45.350 --> 03:37:55.998]  I mean, just exactly what's on display up there, you're dealing with some sort of robot, because they're not allowed to even express themselves per their own values.
[03:37:57.119 --> 03:37:57.579]  Absolutely.
[03:37:57.660 --> 03:37:58.580]  There you have it.
[03:37:58.761 --> 03:37:59.661]  Luke, thank you for your call.
[03:37:59.681 --> 03:38:00.382]  What a great caller.
[03:38:00.482 --> 03:38:02.083]  You know why also it's interesting?
[03:38:02.103 --> 03:38:04.325]  Because he put on there he's a Democrat voting for Trump.
[03:38:05.086 --> 03:38:10.551]  And, you know, I'm definitely not a Democrat, but it's interesting to me.
[03:38:10.611 --> 03:38:11.792]  I'm from Philadelphia, okay?
[03:38:12.152 --> 03:38:15.575]  I'm from a city where guns are the boogeyman.
[03:38:15.635 --> 03:38:16.536]  You know, guns are evil.
[03:38:16.616 --> 03:38:19.179]  If you even saw a gun, it's like, oh my word, right?
[03:38:20.059 --> 03:38:25.181]  I'm from a city where if you weren't a Democrat at any high level, you were pretty much, you know, pushed away.
[03:38:25.201 --> 03:38:28.102]  And it's funny because I'm not, you know, a conservative.
[03:38:28.482 --> 03:38:34.843]  I'm just an open, ideologically open individual that looks for common sense on the third party of reality, right?
[03:38:34.864 --> 03:38:36.224]  And I think that's what we all should be.
[03:38:36.864 --> 03:38:42.686]  And it's interesting to me when you can't label something to dominate it, because we use labels as a form of domination, right?
[03:38:42.726 --> 03:38:49.027]  So let's say we're having a discussion right now and you're presenting me with an ideology that I don't agree with, I could just say, oh, are you a conservative?
[03:38:49.167 --> 03:38:51.668]  If you were to say yes, I could say, oh, and I could just dismiss you right away.
[03:38:52.288 --> 03:38:56.629]  We just label everything we don't understand and try to put it in a box so we understand it.
[03:38:56.829 --> 03:39:00.650]  And then once we understand it, we can pass judgment on it and push it out the window.
[03:39:00.830 --> 03:39:01.090]  Right.
[03:39:01.150 --> 03:39:02.791]  So it's actually a form of control.
[03:39:03.837 --> 03:39:04.477]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:39:04.538 --> 03:39:07.159]  So as soon as we label something, then it's bad, and then we can get rid of it.
[03:39:07.299 --> 03:39:11.462]  Right, which is why, you know, it's interesting we have a lot of people saying, well, why aren't you for Bernie Sanders?
[03:39:12.183 --> 03:39:17.907]  And a lot of us do agree with a lot of the things that he's saying, and we get it why people are so supportive of his message.
[03:39:17.987 --> 03:39:26.373]  But that's the point, is you have to engage those people as well to have them expand on the economy and how that may or may not work.
[03:39:26.453 --> 03:39:30.756]  And it's not, it sounds really good in theory, but how are you going to make it work?
[03:39:30.816 --> 03:39:32.357]  And that's where it falls short.
[03:39:32.777 --> 03:39:33.237]  Exactly.
[03:39:33.337 --> 03:39:38.378]  In fact, I support a lot of the things that Bernie Sanders is for, and I think most of the listeners would too.
[03:39:38.398 --> 03:39:39.639]  He's against the NSA spying.
[03:39:40.439 --> 03:39:44.000]  He's against a lot of weird... Big banks taking over the economy.
[03:39:44.180 --> 03:39:44.760]  Exactly.
[03:39:44.920 --> 03:39:46.520]  He's for a lot of good things.
[03:39:46.600 --> 03:39:52.822]  It's just when you get down the rabbit hole and you look at his policy and you say, oh, okay, 90% tax, not a big fan of that.
[03:39:53.542 --> 03:39:59.208]  Anyway, let's get into the fact if you can just have two girls get up on a podium and shut down your whole speech.
[03:40:00.249 --> 03:40:08.297]  I am not really confident in how you're gonna run the country and be able to, you know, stand down against something much more scary than two
[03:40:09.197 --> 03:40:10.418]  I think you're being sexist, Leigh-Anne.
[03:40:10.579 --> 03:40:10.919]  You're right.
[03:40:11.099 --> 03:40:18.866]  So, alright, let's talk about some news and you've got some news too, so I want you to open up with some of that here in a second, but just to blitz through some.
[03:40:18.906 --> 03:40:24.130]  And we're also going to play a very interesting video from Jakari Jackson at some point in this segment, most likely.
[03:40:25.231 --> 03:40:25.991]  This is a big one.
[03:40:40.838 --> 03:40:41.458]  Is big news.
[03:40:41.558 --> 03:40:59.545]  In a decision that could have far-ranging implications for Americans' privacy protection from law enforcement, an appellate court has for the first time, I'm so stupid, I didn't know a word, ruled strongly against the use of controversial Stingray devices that covertly track citizens' cellular devices.
[03:41:00.425 --> 03:41:06.449]  So, in other words, the police department may not have the ability to look at every single thing you're doing without a warrant anymore.
[03:41:07.170 --> 03:41:08.711]  If this continues further on.
[03:41:08.831 --> 03:41:10.392]  Some pesky little constitution.
[03:41:10.472 --> 03:41:11.753]  Now, are you a vegetarian?
[03:41:12.194 --> 03:41:12.794]  Mostly yes.
[03:41:12.854 --> 03:41:16.157]  Okay, so here's an interesting piece that was mentioned the other day too.
[03:41:17.017 --> 03:41:17.837]  Are we what we eat?
[03:41:17.897 --> 03:41:24.139]  And this is about a study from Cornell University and they found gene mutations.
[03:41:24.219 --> 03:41:28.300]  So they said, a new evolutionary proof of an old adage, we are what we eat.
[03:41:28.380 --> 03:41:41.423]  Cornell University scientists have found tantalizing evidence that a vegetarian diet has led to a mutation that if they stray from balanced omega-6 to omega-3 diet may make people more susceptible to inflammation and by association
[03:41:42.023 --> 03:41:42.443]  I think so.
[03:41:54.656 --> 03:41:57.177]  Well, I mean, I'm not a strict vegetarian.
[03:41:57.197 --> 03:42:08.899]  I do eat seafood sometimes, at least twice a week, because of the fact that I don't feel nourished and I don't think I get enough amino acids and things like that unless I'm doing brags or something.
[03:42:09.260 --> 03:42:14.701]  It's pretty hard to be a very healthy vegetarian, especially with the way that the micronutrients
[03:42:15.541 --> 03:42:18.524]  Micronutrients have been taken out of the soil in general.
[03:42:18.605 --> 03:42:27.394]  So even there, you're getting a depletion of the vitamins and minerals, even if you are eating vegetables, simply because the soil, the mineral content in the soil is so poor.
[03:42:27.735 --> 03:42:29.456]  I think the study is too generalized.
[03:42:29.617 --> 03:42:33.321]  I think if you're comparing... I think there's a million studies about everything that, you know...
[03:42:34.742 --> 03:42:35.022]  I don't know.
[03:42:59.886 --> 03:43:01.507]  It's not an advancement of your health.
[03:43:29.426 --> 03:43:34.652]  I've got this article about, you know, how much exercise does it really take to burn off something like a Big Mac.
[03:43:35.112 --> 03:43:42.582]  And a Big Mac with large fries, Coca-Cola, which is more than all of your daily intake for calories.
[03:43:42.922 --> 03:43:48.148]  I mean, the bare minimum you'd have to do is two and a half hours of cardio, biking, running.
[03:43:48.809 --> 03:43:49.489]  Worth it, right?
[03:43:50.229 --> 03:43:54.390]  Nobody really does that unless you're kind of obsessed with working out, like per day.
[03:43:54.630 --> 03:44:03.132]  And also, I think it's so important to understand, sure, you're gonna maybe burn those calories off, but you know what you can't burn off is all the crap that you're eating.
[03:44:03.773 --> 03:44:12.855]  The fillers, the ingredients, if you have an issue with genetically modified organisms, all the stuff in there, the various chemical substances that you're consuming, you're not gonna burn that off, right?
[03:44:12.875 --> 03:44:13.575]  You're not gonna deadlift
[03:44:13.635 --> 03:44:15.517]  Exactly, because your body doesn't know what to do with it.
[03:44:15.597 --> 03:44:18.699]  And that is the key with the whole, we are what we eat.
[03:44:18.759 --> 03:44:20.261]  Because you really are what you eat.
[03:44:20.281 --> 03:44:21.542]  You're feeding your cells.
[03:44:21.862 --> 03:44:28.908]  So if you're feeding your cells dead animals or, you know, fake processed things that it's a chemical created in the lab.
[03:44:28.928 --> 03:44:30.209]  What's funny is most of it's not even meat.
[03:44:30.249 --> 03:44:36.434]  Actually, I was saying one time I said McDonald's should should label some of their things like chicken nuggets vegetarian.
[03:44:36.734 --> 03:44:38.756]  Because it's mostly not even real meat.
[03:44:39.236 --> 03:44:48.605]  And by the Cornell study, are we what we eat, which is what we talked about earlier, I mean, if you're eating that, then it's basically saying, if you're a vegetarian, there's a concern.
[03:44:48.645 --> 03:44:52.007]  Imagine if we apply the are we what we eat to eating McDonald's.
[03:44:52.048 --> 03:44:52.788]  Processed foods.
[03:44:52.828 --> 03:44:54.189]  Eating total junk.
[03:44:54.229 --> 03:44:56.952]  Nothing but those things that are stored on the shelf.
[03:44:57.212 --> 03:44:57.612]  Exactly.
[03:44:57.652 --> 03:44:58.453]  So what else you got, Leanne?
[03:44:58.473 --> 03:45:00.315]  You still have some interesting news for us today.
[03:45:00.635 --> 03:45:03.217]  Well, on that note, I just thought this was interesting.
[03:45:03.237 --> 03:45:06.380]  There's a 78-year-old gym junkie grandma.
[03:45:06.460 --> 03:45:09.422]  She can deadlift 245 pounds.
[03:45:09.642 --> 03:45:16.848]  So she's a member of Club Fitness, and she's also competing in these competitions.
[03:45:17.269 --> 03:45:22.092]  So people have no excuse to not get out there and take care of themselves and do something.
[03:45:22.112 --> 03:45:26.236]  I mean, she's lifting more than 180-pound men could lift.
[03:45:26.336 --> 03:45:28.358]  I certainly can't deadlift nearly 300 pounds.
[03:45:28.378 --> 03:45:29.759]  She's not being suppressed by sexism?
[03:45:30.239 --> 03:45:31.920]  Yeah, no, she's just out there.
[03:45:31.960 --> 03:45:38.723]  But no matter what age you are, you can do something proactive and take care of your health, which I think is pretty cool.
[03:45:39.103 --> 03:45:50.287]  On the flip side of that, I will say I have been seeing a lot of articles lately praising anorexic women that are going from anorexia and then they become these bodybuilding competitors.
[03:45:50.867 --> 03:45:52.448]  And you think, well, that's great.
[03:45:52.548 --> 03:45:59.291]  Now they're being very healthy, but they're sort of trading one extreme food and diet for another.
[03:45:59.411 --> 03:46:04.117]  Well you know what's funny about all that really sad stuff is that they attack people.
[03:46:04.458 --> 03:46:14.111]  There was that huge problem with the protein company that used a model woman, you know, to promote their protein or whatever saying it had unrealistic standards, right?
[03:46:14.351 --> 03:46:15.372]  But the real problem is
[03:46:16.013 --> 03:46:18.655]  Okay, the celebrity culture, why does no one talk about that?
[03:46:18.695 --> 03:46:22.118]  They talk about how, you know, there's sexism, the band-aids are offending people.
[03:46:22.578 --> 03:46:37.109]  Women are actually being drove into anorexia because they watch the media culture, which is the establishment culture, which acts like they back the social justice warrior system, but then it's showing all the models as like a hundred pound goddesses with abs and they're like, yes.
[03:46:37.529 --> 03:46:38.870]  Get rid of the patriarchy.
[03:46:39.010 --> 03:46:51.916]  Meanwhile, they're being driven to anorexia because they watch all that stuff, but then the same media groups get behind the social justice warrior ideology and say, yes, it's your fault, people, that are supporting anything.
[03:46:52.056 --> 03:46:53.097]  It's Trump supporters' fault.
[03:46:53.157 --> 03:46:53.737]  It's like, what?
[03:46:54.117 --> 03:46:55.158]  It's totally absurd.
[03:46:56.348 --> 03:47:13.863]  No, I think that's something that a lot of people really need to pay attention to because I know there's actually a girl at my gym that I want to go and talk to this girl and that you know I don't really know her but she is clearly anorexic but now she is like us you know bodybuilding at the same time and so there's this sort of a
[03:47:15.535 --> 03:47:16.255]  I don't know.
[03:47:32.824 --> 03:47:33.804]  It's just one addiction.
[03:47:34.064 --> 03:47:35.725]  Yeah, it's really frightening.
[03:47:35.765 --> 03:47:48.588]  So I would, you know, I hope people kind of, because anorexia is one of those diseases that it's a silent disease and people need to be able to speak out about that unhealthy way that, you know, women are treating themselves.
[03:47:48.868 --> 03:47:49.368]  Absolutely.
[03:47:49.568 --> 03:47:51.449]  We don't have time to play the Jakari Report, do we?
[03:47:51.489 --> 03:47:53.870]  But we probably have time for the Watson Report.
[03:47:54.410 --> 03:47:54.930]  Guys, do you think?
[03:47:56.849 --> 03:47:58.230]  Awesome, we're going to check that out for a second.
[03:47:58.250 --> 03:48:01.012]  And then we might go to this report by Watson, because I wanted to play it.
[03:48:01.472 --> 03:48:06.456]  It's interesting about this whole Michelle Fields assault stuff, because no one knows the clear picture of what actually went down.
[03:48:06.696 --> 03:48:10.599]  But Watson always does these amazing, the truth about blank videos.
[03:48:10.619 --> 03:48:13.020]  So he's going to break down the truth about the Michelle Fields assault.
[03:48:13.040 --> 03:48:14.041]  Let's go ahead and watch that video.
[03:48:14.621 --> 03:48:29.605]  The truth about the supposed battery of Breitbart journalist Michelle Fields by Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is that Fields, Lewandowski, and supporters of both are all lying about what happened.
[03:48:30.045 --> 03:48:41.488]  Today it was confirmed that Lewandowski had been charged with misdemeanor battery for an incident earlier this month when Lewandowski appeared to grab Fields' arm to prevent her from asking Trump a question.
[03:48:42.248 --> 03:48:47.652]  A new surveillance video released by police shows Lewandowski yanking Fields back by the arm.
[03:48:48.547 --> 03:48:55.131]  First of all, why are Fields supporters pretending like this is the first time we've seen video of this incident?
[03:48:55.712 --> 03:49:06.439]  This video of the incident was released weeks ago, yet was largely glossed over by the media because it contradicted Fields' characterization of what happened.
[03:49:06.779 --> 03:49:11.282]  Michelle Fields lied about the incident from the start.
[03:49:11.903 --> 03:49:12.963]  She claimed, quote,
[03:49:18.727 --> 03:49:24.670]  The video footage clearly shows that she was pulled back, not yanked down.
[03:49:25.451 --> 03:49:31.093]  Fields said, quote, I almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance.
[03:49:31.994 --> 03:49:37.177]  The video footage clearly shows she did not almost fall to the ground.
[03:49:37.477 --> 03:49:43.420]  She also claims that Lewandowski, quote, aggressively tried to pull me to the ground.
[03:49:44.380 --> 03:49:47.682]  The video clearly shows that's not what happened.
[03:49:48.102 --> 03:49:55.886]  She also went on television claiming that this was the worst thing to happen to her in her entire life, apart from her father dying.
[03:49:56.486 --> 03:49:57.606]  Well, it feels awful.
[03:49:58.227 --> 03:50:02.669]  Um, this has to be, aside from my father's death, the worst experience I've gone through.
[03:50:02.969 --> 03:50:10.993]  Unless Fields has lived a near-perfect utopian life, that's obviously a massive exaggeration.
[03:50:11.553 --> 03:50:29.025]  Despite the fact that Fields was obviously completely mischaracterizing the incident, the media bolstered her credibility because it synced with their narrative of demonizing Trump, his staffers, and his supporters as unhinged violent extremists.
[03:50:29.766 --> 03:50:34.729]  Fields told police that she fell back but caught herself from falling.
[03:50:35.330 --> 03:50:39.333]  The video clearly shows she did not fall back.
[03:50:40.133 --> 03:50:41.194]  Alright, there you go.
[03:50:41.334 --> 03:50:45.655]  There's the video from Paul Joseph Watson up on his YouTube account and on Infowars.com.
[03:50:45.995 --> 03:50:50.937]  We'll be right back with some more news and perhaps something very interesting from Leanne.
[03:50:51.397 --> 03:50:53.358]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:53.378 --> 03:50:55.039]  This is Anthony Gucciardi with Leanne McAdee.
[03:50:55.059 --> 03:50:55.559]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:09.963 --> 03:51:18.007]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:18.687 --> 03:51:19.407]  What did I do?
[03:51:20.148 --> 03:51:27.471]  I created Extendivite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:28.091 --> 03:51:36.515]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[03:51:37.055 --> 03:51:41.496]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:42.216 --> 03:51:45.577]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.
[03:51:45.877 --> 03:51:47.557]  To get your Xtendivite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[03:51:47.577 --> 03:51:48.758]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:48.778 --> 03:51:51.798]  Xtendivite is only $69.95 for a 2-month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:52:12.065 --> 03:52:18.549]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[03:52:19.490 --> 03:52:22.272]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:52:23.092 --> 03:52:26.795]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:52:27.435 --> 03:52:28.676]  I said, let me see.
[03:52:29.257 --> 03:52:39.847]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:52:40.348 --> 03:52:51.478]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:52:52.406 --> 03:52:53.107]  How about you?
[03:52:53.427 --> 03:52:54.729]  For your free quote, call 1-800-654-1632.
[03:52:54.749 --> 03:52:55.029]  That's 1-800-654-1632.
[03:52:55.049 --> 03:52:55.109]  1-800-654-1632.
[03:52:55.169 --> 03:52:56.171]  Or go to selectquote.com.

[03:54:07.020 --> 03:54:07.760]  Effective.
[03:54:16.463 --> 03:54:17.603]  Alright, we are back.
[03:54:18.184 --> 03:54:31.968]  And, you know, it's actually my fault that I failed to mention to you that Vitamin Mineral Fusion, which is, in my view, the most highly advanced multivitamin powder drink mix that's on the market, is on Infowarslife.com.
[03:54:32.068 --> 03:54:32.788]  It's new.
[03:54:33.288 --> 03:54:34.328]  It just came out yesterday.
[03:54:34.849 --> 03:54:39.070]  And by the estimations that I was just given, it's probably going to sell out within one week.
[03:54:39.850 --> 03:54:41.191]  Potentially by the weekend.
[03:54:41.491 --> 03:54:49.215]  So I'm not sure when it's gonna sell out, but now is the time to go to Infowarslife.com and get your canister of vitamin mineral fusion.
[03:54:50.273 --> 03:55:14.004]  So actually, right here, the difference between this and what you might find if you use, let's say, go to a store or you look online and check out some of the products, is this doesn't just have vitamins that you need, like vitamin C, E, D. It has a whole laundry list of things like amino acids and minerals, biotin, all in plant-derived forms or highly advanced lab forms.
[03:55:14.524 --> 03:55:16.825]  And it's sweetened with xylitol.
[03:55:17.185 --> 03:55:18.326]  It's called Xivia.
[03:55:18.726 --> 03:55:23.250]  And it's a patented form of xylitol that helps protect the teeth, helps to fight cavities.
[03:55:23.590 --> 03:55:24.431]  It's not sugar.
[03:55:24.511 --> 03:55:25.371]  It's not fructose.
[03:55:25.451 --> 03:55:26.092]  It's the real deal.
[03:55:26.132 --> 03:55:26.692]  It tastes great.
[03:55:27.793 --> 03:55:28.354]  Give it a shot.
[03:55:28.714 --> 03:55:29.054]  Try it.
[03:55:29.615 --> 03:55:31.676]  It's pretty affordable at Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:32.077 --> 03:55:32.737]  Let us know what you think.
[03:55:32.757 --> 03:55:33.838]  Put it up there on the reviews.
[03:55:34.218 --> 03:55:40.883]  And you can also read the reviews for yourself on all the other products, like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:41.304 --> 03:55:45.227]  Now, Leanne, what you gonna talk about tonight on the Infowars Nightly News?
[03:55:45.387 --> 03:56:11.662]  Well, we're going to kind of break down all of the rumors of this potential nuclear attack by ISIS and just talk about, it's very interesting that there is a lot of discussion about nuclear warheads, China, North Korea, but as well, just about last year, they reported there was a strange, mysterious break-in at a nuclear facility in the United States and they reported on it, you know, maybe for a couple days and then it just completely went away.
[03:56:12.102 --> 03:56:21.369]  And then of course the US and the UK are doing a cyber drill to test the cyber capabilities of an attack on a nuclear facility.
[03:56:21.409 --> 03:56:22.290]  So it's pretty interesting.
[03:56:22.970 --> 03:56:27.954]  Also about the subversive takeover of our election as well through our schools.
[03:56:28.434 --> 03:56:30.396]  So David Knight will be breaking that down with me.
[03:56:31.316 --> 03:56:37.601]  But I wanted to go ahead and challenge you, Anthony Gucciardi, to an experience that I would like to do.
[03:56:38.562 --> 03:56:41.925]  You know I've been on this kind of health kick and self-improvement.
[03:56:42.505 --> 03:56:44.507]  One thing that I cannot do is meditate.
[03:56:44.767 --> 03:56:45.448]  I just can't.
[03:56:45.828 --> 03:56:47.589]  My brain is always going a million miles.
[03:56:48.090 --> 03:56:55.356]  So something that's supposed to really help you with that is sensory deprivation tanks, flotation pools.
[03:56:56.241 --> 03:57:02.563]  The salt is matching to your body content and the water is the same temperature as your body so you kind of don't feel anything.
[03:57:02.583 --> 03:57:05.344]  You're floating in an enclosed tank and there's no light.
[03:57:05.504 --> 03:57:07.264]  There's no lights, there's no sound.
[03:57:07.284 --> 03:57:11.786]  You're just, you're basically suspended in the air is what you feel like.
[03:57:11.806 --> 03:57:19.068]  You're floating through space and apparently this is one of the best ways to help you reach that stillness.
[03:57:19.656 --> 03:57:21.158]  There's tons of people that say it's amazing.
[03:57:21.198 --> 03:57:22.019]  Joe Rogan loves it.
[03:57:22.239 --> 03:57:23.140]  He talks about it all the time.
[03:57:23.221 --> 03:57:26.605]  I want to go and do a report on it and see how it really is.
[03:57:26.625 --> 03:57:28.848]  I know you're kind of into that stuff.
[03:57:29.108 --> 03:57:29.909]  I will do one with you.
[03:57:29.949 --> 03:57:30.670]  Challenge accepted.
[03:57:30.830 --> 03:57:35.876]  We will go into a sensory deprivation tank and find the meaning of life.
[03:57:36.843 --> 03:57:37.344]  Perfect.
[03:57:37.524 --> 03:57:38.265]  I've been meaning to do one.
[03:57:38.285 --> 03:57:40.207]  I actually bought a couple credits to a place and didn't go.
[03:57:40.567 --> 03:57:41.408]  Very interesting stuff.
[03:57:41.688 --> 03:57:46.614]  Some of the things we didn't get to are states to dissolve cancer funds accused of misusing funds.
[03:57:47.235 --> 03:57:49.978]  It's just been, you know, ongoing for years and years.
[03:57:50.198 --> 03:57:52.220]  But at least someone's finally doing something about it.
[03:57:52.260 --> 03:57:57.766]  Two cancer charities accused in New York of misusing 75 million dollars in donations for
[03:57:58.527 --> 03:57:59.588]  Jet ski outings.
[03:58:00.249 --> 03:58:01.110]  What are they used for?
[03:58:01.230 --> 03:58:09.739]  Jet ski outings, dating website subscriptions, and other personal spending are being dissolved for all 50 United States in the U.S.
[03:58:10.099 --> 03:58:13.943]  Attorney General, or I can't even read that point, Attorney of some kind said on Wednesday.
[03:58:14.083 --> 03:58:21.131]  Wow, it's kind of like the eight houses that they built for the Haitians following that devastating earthquake with all the millions of dollars in aid they got.
[03:58:21.271 --> 03:58:25.456]  Well, you gotta go jet skiing sometimes on $75 million in cancer charity donations.
[03:58:25.676 --> 03:58:26.598]  Total absurdity!
[03:58:26.998 --> 03:58:28.940]  Been talking about that for years and years and years.
[03:58:29.301 --> 03:58:31.023]  Anyway, thanks so much for watching the show.
[03:58:31.143 --> 03:58:34.427]  It's been a pleasure to be joined by you guys and hosting the show.
[03:58:34.747 --> 03:58:37.130]  Alex will be back tomorrow from 11 to 2 p.m.
[03:58:37.170 --> 03:58:37.531]  Central.
[03:58:37.871 --> 03:58:38.672]  Thanks so much for watching.
[03:58:38.692 --> 03:58:39.834]  This is the Alex Jones Show.

[03:59:02.061 --> 03:59:02.962]  But where do you get it?
[03:59:03.262 --> 03:59:05.043]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand
