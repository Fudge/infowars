[00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:21.970]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.614]  It is Friday, September 2nd, 2016, and I'm Leigh-Anne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:26.675]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.490]  Hillary Clinton threatens war with Russia.
[00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.112]  The United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:00:39.652 --> 00:00:44.954]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:00:45.054 --> 00:00:53.797]  Meanwhile, under questioning by the FBI, Hillary says she can't remember getting briefed on how to secure government records.
[00:00:54.317 --> 00:00:58.319]  Because, get this, she had suffered from a concussion.
[00:00:59.537 --> 00:01:01.819]  Yes, she really said that.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:12.848]  Plus, Donald Trump wants to build the wall higher and says it would be sweet justice to pay for it with money seized from the Mexican drug cartels.
[00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.712]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:34.592]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:45.602]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:50.685]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:01:50.805 --> 00:01:53.327]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:01:53.387 --> 00:01:54.868]  It helps detoxify.
[00:01:54.888 --> 00:01:57.910]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.733]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:06.896]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:14.322]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:15.863]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:02:16.063 --> 00:02:16.804]  This is so key.
[00:02:17.044 --> 00:02:21.327]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:23.469]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.052]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:39.861]  Now we are introducing a new t-shirt, which I think folks need to get, telling the real truth about Bill Clinton, who is a serial rapist and a user of women.
[00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:43.764]  In another case, it's about groping and fondling and touching against a woman's will.
[00:02:43.924 --> 00:02:44.304]  And rape.
[00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:44.865]  And rape.
[00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:49.108]  Bill rapes them physically, and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:49.788]  He's a rapist.
[00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:50.749]  Absolutely.
[00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.050]  He's a public figure, he goes straight to hell.
[00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.017]  Get your Bill Clinton rape shirt today at InfoWarsTore.com or call 1-800-253-3139.
[00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:12.914]  The FBI has gifted Hillary Clinton with yet another get out of jail free card, this time by way of a massive data dump on the Friday of a long Labor Day weekend.
[00:03:14.315 --> 00:03:28.410]  Ladies and gentlemen, today the FBI has released the report, a two part, 58 page report of their investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as a Secretary of State.
[00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.192]  Now there isn't really
[00:03:30.732 --> 00:03:31.313]  I don't think so.
[00:03:46.348 --> 00:03:53.693]  Disregard for the laws and rules in accordance to the use of an email server and classified information.
[00:03:53.913 --> 00:03:57.996]  Now, this full report can be found on FBI.gov.
[00:03:58.036 --> 00:04:01.618]  It's a two-part report, 58 pages, and you can go look at this report.
[00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:02.699]  There's a lot to be read.
[00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.742]  It will show you some of the nature of this Hillary Clinton cover-up.
[00:04:07.202 --> 00:04:15.939]  But you will also see a lot of this report is redacted, including names that have been redacted from this report.
[00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.864]  But you can find the full report on FBI.gov.
[00:04:20.728 --> 00:04:24.150]  So we know that more than 17,000 emails were recovered.
[00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:30.494]  We know that her server was breached even a month before she left office there as Secretary of State.
[00:04:31.335 --> 00:04:35.958]  She did indeed click on a porn phishing scandal.
[00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:40.681]  There was a phishing scam and she actually, it appears that she clicked on it.
[00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:44.524]  But she also repeatedly said that she could not recall.
[00:04:44.664 --> 00:04:47.346]  She said this so many times throughout the FBI report.
[00:04:47.847 --> 00:04:48.748]  I could not recall.
[00:04:48.808 --> 00:04:49.528]  I do not recall.
[00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:50.649]  Here are just some of the things.
[00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.293]  She couldn't recall her training that she received on get this classified information.
[00:04:55.814 --> 00:04:58.856]  She didn't recall using her power to classify.
[00:04:59.217 --> 00:05:03.280]  She didn't recall receiving emails that should not be on her unclassified system.
[00:05:03.661 --> 00:05:07.584]  And she did not recall briefings she received when leaving office.
[00:05:07.684 --> 00:05:08.405]  And why not?
[00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:12.128]  She could not recall because of her fall.
[00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:14.930]  All of these things were due to that concussion.
[00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:17.292]  And this was what she told the FBI.
[00:05:17.312 --> 00:05:22.857]  She did not recall all these briefings because of this concussion that she suffered in 2012.
[00:05:23.998 --> 00:05:34.827]  And she went on further to say she received no instructions or direction regarding the preservation or production of records from the State Department during the transition out of her role as Secretary of State.
[00:05:36.027 --> 00:05:42.470]  However, in December 2012, Clinton suffered a concussion and then around the New Year had a blood clot in her head.
[00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:50.713]  Based on her doctor's advice, she could only work at State for a few hours a day and could not recall every briefing that she received.
[00:05:51.373 --> 00:05:51.794]  But you know what?
[00:05:51.854 --> 00:05:53.014]  Nothing to worry about here.
[00:05:53.094 --> 00:05:58.556]  Having a massive brain injury isn't going to impair her ability to do her job, right?
[00:05:58.736 --> 00:06:02.378]  At least that's what the establishment is really trying to make everyone understand.
[00:06:03.098 --> 00:06:08.104]  She also went on to tell the FBI that she didn't understand classified intel.
[00:06:08.365 --> 00:06:12.950]  So this is what she suggested to FBI investigators in this interview that she had in July.
[00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.776]  She had little understanding of classified information when she served as Secretary of State.
[00:06:17.796 --> 00:06:18.617]  Are you kidding me?
[00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:31.325]  She told FBI agents she couldn't remember ever receiving this training, how to preserve the federal records, or how to treat classified material, even though we now know that she signed off on completing the training.
[00:06:31.365 --> 00:06:34.367]  So she did indeed take it, but you know, she had her little head injury.
[00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:38.308]  She just couldn't remember a lot of the most important things about her jobs.
[00:06:38.688 --> 00:06:43.329]  So here she's sort of setting it up that, you know, due to this injury, she's not guilty.
[00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.490]  You know, that's where the FBI said they couldn't prove any intent to do harm.
[00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.711]  Now, she could not give an example of how classification of a document was determined.
[00:06:54.231 --> 00:07:03.853]  Now, of course, this is, you know, not due where she's telling her aides to just strip the classified markings from these materials so that she could send them on her unsecured server.
[00:07:05.073 --> 00:07:15.157]  What's more, Clinton said in an email that was central to this investigation, one of these emails involved conversations about a planned drone strike in Pakistan.
[00:07:15.878 --> 00:07:22.200]  This didn't raise any red flags for her when she was transmitting this highly classified information over her unsecured server.
[00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:30.664]  Clinton stated, deliberation over a future drone strike did not give her cause for concern regarding classification.
[00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:31.745]  Are you kidding me?
[00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:34.767]  That would be of the utmost classification level.
[00:07:35.107 --> 00:07:46.916]  Here you are not only undermining military efforts, but possibly putting people's lives in danger if indeed your computer is hacked, which we now know thanks to these recovered emails.
[00:07:47.297 --> 00:07:52.421]  She did indeed believe that her server was hacked, and we know that it had been as well.
[00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:58.002]  Also, Hillary Clinton lost cell phones with classified emails.
[00:07:58.422 --> 00:08:07.305]  Now, this is Breitbart News reporting that she lost several mobile telephones carrying emails from her private server during her time in office.
[00:08:08.185 --> 00:08:16.527]  Huma Abedin and another former aide indicated the whereabouts of Clinton's devices would frequently become unknown once she transitioned to a new device.
[00:08:17.008 --> 00:08:21.749]  On other occasions, a staffer would destroy Clinton's old mobile phones by breaking them in half
[00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:24.010]  Or hitting them with a hammer.
[00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:35.621]  And this is all very important because when you're destroying phones, that obviously indicates that you are well aware that there is sensitive information contained on these devices.
[00:08:36.122 --> 00:08:43.969]  So, just to remind everyone, federal law prohibits the unauthorized transfer, storage, or destruction of classified information.
[00:08:44.409 --> 00:08:48.093]  Federal records acts likewise prohibit the destruction of government documents.
[00:08:48.533 --> 00:08:54.015]  Which would have included work-related emails on Clinton's server and mobile devices.
[00:08:54.295 --> 00:09:03.898]  So here indeed, she did break federal law, but for whatever reason, James Comey just wanted to give her a little slap on the wrist and say that they were very, very reckless.
[00:09:03.998 --> 00:09:11.921]  And this is a person that we want to, well, not I, but they would like to see in the most powerful position in the United States.
[00:09:13.365 --> 00:09:19.848]  If Donald Trump threatened to go to war with a major military power, do you think the media would be interested?
[00:09:20.068 --> 00:09:26.711]  Yet Hillary Clinton just did precisely that, and it's barely a footnote in the mainstream press.
[00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:27.392]  Take a look.
[00:09:27.992 --> 00:09:29.092]  You've seen reports.
[00:09:30.313 --> 00:09:32.034]  Russia's hacked into a lot of things.
[00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:33.675]  China's hacked into a lot of things.
[00:09:33.715 --> 00:09:36.296]  Russia even hacked into the Democratic National Committee.
[00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.538]  Maybe even some state election systems.
[00:09:41.558 --> 00:09:43.259]  So we've got to step up our game.
[00:09:43.939 --> 00:09:48.121]  Make sure we are well defended and able to take the fight to those who go after us.
[00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:56.904]  As President, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:09:57.484 --> 00:10:02.766]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:10:03.266 --> 00:10:16.776]  In case you missed that, Hillary just said that the next time Russia is blamed for a hack, because there's no evidence whatsoever that they were behind the DNC hack, Hillary will fight them with a military response.
[00:10:17.056 --> 00:10:19.398]  Fighting with a military response.
[00:10:19.478 --> 00:10:23.161]  That sounds a heck of a lot like a threat of war to me.
[00:10:23.421 --> 00:10:25.963]  Threatening to declare war on Russia.
[00:10:26.423 --> 00:10:28.845]  You'd think that would be a big story, right?
[00:10:29.165 --> 00:10:33.569]  Yet virtually no big media outlet even highlighted it.
[00:10:33.809 --> 00:10:37.432]  Donald Trump has been savaged for being reckless with his words.
[00:10:37.732 --> 00:10:46.559]  Yet here we have Hillary openly invoking military conflict with a global superpower and the media gives her a free pass.
[00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:54.265]  We've had a year of hysteria over Trump starting World War 3 and having control over the nuclear codes.
[00:10:54.665 --> 00:11:00.428]  But it's not Trump who's brazenly threatening another nuclear-armed country with war.
[00:11:00.968 --> 00:11:02.409]  It's Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:02.589 --> 00:11:04.390]  Clinton is crazy.
[00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:14.735]  She thinks Vladimir Putin is behind literally everything from WikiLeaks email hacks to Trump to the rise of the alt-right with zero evidence.
[00:11:15.235 --> 00:11:18.176]  But the media parrots it like it's gospel.
[00:11:18.596 --> 00:11:23.719]  She's also perfectly prepared to launch into wars that have disastrous consequences.
[00:11:23.899 --> 00:11:26.481]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:11:27.922 --> 00:11:31.424]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:11:31.564 --> 00:11:34.746]  We would be able to totally obliterate them.
[00:11:35.026 --> 00:11:41.731]  Hillary Clinton openly threatening war with Russia, and the media doesn't even report on it.
[00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:48.555]  But they'll continue to lecture us about how it's Trump who's being irresponsible with his rhetoric.
[00:11:49.056 --> 00:11:50.857]  Give me a break.
[00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.992]  Well, here's something else that Hillary Clinton couldn't recall.
[00:11:55.353 --> 00:11:57.535]  She also wanted to build a wall.
[00:11:57.715 --> 00:11:58.135]  That's right.
[00:11:58.255 --> 00:12:00.437]  She mimicked Donald Trump here.
[00:12:00.497 --> 00:12:06.523]  She foreshadowed what Donald Trump was calling for, saying, let's build a wall and deport illegal immigrants.
[00:12:07.303 --> 00:12:13.409]  There isn't any sensible approach except to do what we need to do simultaneously.
[00:12:13.429 --> 00:12:16.652]  You know, secure our borders with technology, personnel.
[00:12:17.313 --> 00:12:17.574]  I'm good.
[00:12:27.651 --> 00:12:36.376]  Create the environment in which we get people out of the shadows and then give them some earned right to legalization.
[00:12:37.397 --> 00:12:43.700]  So doesn't that sound an awful lot like Donald Trump's speech that he gave in Mexico City on Tuesday?
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.522]  Of course, Hillary Clinton heavily criticized Donald Trump.
[00:12:47.863 --> 00:12:51.965]  And of course, just reiterated the fact that there's no way Mexico is going to pay for a wall.
[00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:53.406]  They'll never, they'll never.
[00:12:53.766 --> 00:12:54.427]  Stand for it.
[00:12:54.808 --> 00:12:56.990]  Well, here's something interesting.
[00:12:57.571 --> 00:12:59.934]  Just how would Mexico pay for this wall?
[00:13:00.014 --> 00:13:06.663]  Donald Trump is actually toying with the idea of using seized drug cartel money to pay for the border wall.
[00:13:07.984 --> 00:13:11.507]  Trump came to Austin last week to solidify his stance on illegal immigration.
[00:13:11.527 --> 00:13:19.415]  He then flew to Mexico where he did a two-man conference with Mexican President Peña Nieto, which was heralded as a great success across the hemisphere.
[00:13:19.475 --> 00:13:24.539]  Now one major issue for Trump throughout his candidacy is securing the US-Mexico border.
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:29.484]  Possibly using seized drug money to do this would be one way in which this wall is built.
[00:13:29.564 --> 00:13:32.627]  Now something called a joint border security fund would be created.
[00:13:33.147 --> 00:13:34.448]  By both Mexico and the U.S.
[00:13:34.468 --> 00:13:43.733]  depositing money that they've seized, law enforcement has seized from drug cartels, and money from the illicit drug trade alone last year topped $8.7 billion.
[00:13:43.853 --> 00:13:52.818]  One study says that these cartels are making as much as $30 billion a year doing these illegal drug runs, and Trump says that he could get this wall built for $8 to $10 billion.
[00:13:52.858 --> 00:14:00.082]  So it looks like he's going to be taking seized drug money from these cartels, putting it in a joint account that they've seized, and using it to build this wall.
[00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:15.858]  Well, following a lot of outcry over its decision to demonetize videos with controversial content, YouTube, the way they responded was by doubling down, saying, sorry guys, whatever, we've been punishing people for years.
[00:14:16.378 --> 00:14:18.799]  So this is obviously a Google-owned platform.
[00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:32.206]  They recently released new advertiser-friendly guidelines that stipulate how discussion of controversial or sensitive subjects and events would be punished by the user being unable to collect advertising money on such videos.
[00:14:32.506 --> 00:14:35.428]  So this prompted huge backlash from the YouTube community.
[00:14:35.968 --> 00:14:50.563]  Many people saw it as a way to de-incentivize the creating of any videos that touch on contentious political or social issues, of course, but YouTube just insisted that they had already been punishing controversial opinions for years.
[00:14:50.903 --> 00:14:54.987]  They say, we haven't changed its policy on which videos will have adverts attached to them.
[00:14:55.427 --> 00:14:58.651]  Since 2013, we've just merely improved the way
[00:14:58.991 --> 00:14:59.251]  I think so.
[00:15:17.674 --> 00:15:18.654]  I don't think so.
[00:15:44.242 --> 00:15:48.888]  This is exactly what Matt Drudge warned about when he appeared on the Alex Jones Show nearly a year ago.
[00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:55.758]  Creators allowing their content to be swallowed up by social media ghettos was always going to lead to this outcome.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:05.025]  Donna Brazile, Interment Resident Witch-in-Chief, head of the DNC, taking Debbie Wasserman Schultz's place after that massive corruption scandal gone bad.
[00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:09.027]  She made some pretty explosive statements on CNN this week, too good to pass up.
[00:16:09.567 --> 00:16:15.911]  She says that Hillary Clinton was perfectly fine, nothing criminal about her pay-to-play activity as State Department head.
[00:16:15.931 --> 00:16:16.892]  Take a listen to this.
[00:16:18.339 --> 00:16:21.282]  The way I look at it, I've been a government official.
[00:16:21.743 --> 00:16:31.975]  So, you know, this notion that somehow or another, someone who is a supporter, someone who's a donor, somebody who's an activist saying, I want access, I want to come into a room and I want to meet people.
[00:16:33.917 --> 00:16:38.599]  We often criminalize behavior that is normal, and I don't see what the smoke is.
[00:16:38.919 --> 00:16:50.563]  Now, Brazil replaced one corrupt figurehead that now works for Hillary Clinton, and she seems to think that as a fellow politician, there is nothing wrong with paying for access to political officials.
[00:16:50.583 --> 00:16:51.584]  That's exactly what she said.
[00:16:51.724 --> 00:16:52.464]  It's normal.
[00:16:52.524 --> 00:16:53.384]  We all do it.
[00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:57.026]  Now, keep in mind, if there's any doubt that our system isn't corrupt,
[00:16:57.486 --> 00:16:58.026]  Is that what it is?
[00:17:18.993 --> 00:17:27.199]  Now if that hasn't made you sick already, those two, this is really reminiscent of what Obama said when he was questioned about, is our election system rigged?
[00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:28.260]  Take a listen.
[00:17:30.101 --> 00:17:33.804]  I don't even really know where to start on answering this question.
[00:17:35.425 --> 00:17:37.606]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[00:17:37.686 --> 00:17:38.447]  What does that mean?
[00:17:41.749 --> 00:17:45.232]  The federal government doesn't run the election process.
[00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:55.661]  States and cities and communities all across the country, they're the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting booths.
[00:17:56.021 --> 00:18:11.874]  And if Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country, including in places like Texas,
[00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:20.737]  Where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths.
[00:18:22.379 --> 00:18:23.000]  That's ridiculous.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.082]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:18:24.182 --> 00:18:26.025]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:28.952]  Now you think that's corrupt.
[00:18:28.972 --> 00:18:32.033]  Just wait until we get the dump of Hillary Clinton's emails.
[00:18:32.214 --> 00:18:34.455]  Those 15,000, the feds are reviewing them now.
[00:18:34.495 --> 00:18:36.896]  They're slated to be seen sometime around mid-October.
[00:18:36.956 --> 00:18:39.037]  And what they reveal next, who knows?
[00:18:39.097 --> 00:18:44.040]  But what we do know is our president is already on, making sure that she's got this election in the bag.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.642]  He says that he's sending UN monitors to monitor our U.S.
[00:18:47.722 --> 00:18:50.283]  election because we just can't trust ourselves with it.
[00:18:51.124 --> 00:18:52.485]  But hey, all well and good.
[00:18:52.685 --> 00:18:53.545]  Right, Donna Brazile?
[00:18:53.885 --> 00:18:56.347]  I'm Margaret Halverd reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:19:12.199 --> 00:19:15.863]  He who controls the trends, controls the future.
[00:19:16.683 --> 00:19:20.787]  He who controls the future, controls the destiny of humanity.
[00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:34.321]  My friends, the globalist social engineers are obsessed with creating false memes, false trends that they control.
[00:19:36.929 --> 00:19:44.792]  To create a population of trendies from those false trends that don't have their own destiny.
[00:19:45.752 --> 00:20:01.477]  Who don't even have a basic organic human genetic drive to build something that is satisfying, trailblazing, and innately independent and human.
[00:20:02.492 --> 00:20:07.116]  And if you understand this paradigm, you understand all the others.
[00:20:07.657 --> 00:20:20.369]  One of hundreds of memes and trends we've been successfully able to launch and force into the consciousness is a Operation Against Hillary Clinton we launched 10 months ago with the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.072]  It's now been duplicated by countless groups and I think that's wonderful.
[00:20:25.034 --> 00:20:31.958]  Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and now it's all over CNN, it's all over Fox, it's all over the Trump rallies, the Hillary rallies.
[00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:39.383]  The number one search term for a week straight, last week, and still continuing, one of the top search terms is, is Hillary going to jail?
[00:20:39.723 --> 00:20:41.825]  This has been incredibly successful.
[00:20:42.105 --> 00:20:46.468]  Because it shows, despite corporate control, and despite them trying to control the meme,
[00:20:47.068 --> 00:21:03.960]  We are able to synergistically wear our colors loud and proud against injustice, corruption, and oppression, and show that we, humans, not the globalist controllers, but the common little people, can set the trends, can set the memes.
[00:21:04.821 --> 00:21:07.142]  We've had three versions of the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[00:21:07.662 --> 00:21:11.083]  All of them have been collector's edition and have helped fund the InfoWar.
[00:21:11.664 --> 00:21:14.225]  We now have a third edition in.
[00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:15.785]  The second edition sold out.
[00:21:16.145 --> 00:21:32.692]  It's the same as the last, but on the right shoulder says InfoWars.com, on the back it says InfoWars.com, legalized freedom, be part of history, be part of supporting the InfoWar, be part of meeting like-minded friends and family.
[00:21:33.809 --> 00:21:49.114]  And be part of breaking out of their paradigm and setting the agenda, setting the trend, setting the true, organic, teleprompter-free reawakening of humanity.

[00:22:02.073 --> 00:22:02.874]  Come on, Hillary.
[00:22:03.054 --> 00:22:03.655]  Just a little.
[00:22:03.935 --> 00:22:04.736]  Just a little sip.
[00:22:05.297 --> 00:22:05.597]  Open up.
[00:22:05.897 --> 00:22:06.778]  Come on, take it!
[00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:07.679]  Take it!
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.401]  I'm running for president.
[00:22:09.802 --> 00:22:12.986]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:22:13.006 --> 00:22:17.431]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:23:07.375 --> 00:23:15.426]  In just under 30 years, China has catapulted into a superpower, challenging American dominance in just about every field imaginable.
[00:23:15.847 --> 00:23:20.433]  But the real question is, is just how will China overtake the U.S.
[00:23:20.573 --> 00:23:22.696]  to become the supreme global power?
[00:23:23.117 --> 00:23:28.482]  There's a new film called China on Top, how China is using America's playbook to take over the world.
[00:23:28.862 --> 00:23:36.529]  It's a documentary film directed by Jonathan Roth and it explores how China will become the world's economic and geopolitical leader.
[00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.332]  Let's go ahead and take a look at a scene from the film.
[00:23:41.194 --> 00:23:47.539]  My wife and I sponsored a gala to raise two million dollars for the Asian art museums here on the Washington Mall.
[00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:57.312]  Part of that was an event involving Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, giving a large cash award and a medal to a Chinese artist.
[00:23:57.852 --> 00:24:00.093]  Art is a tool of diplomacy.
[00:24:00.313 --> 00:24:10.196]  It is one that reaches beyond governments, past all of the official conference rooms and the presidential palaces, to connect with people all over the world.
[00:24:10.556 --> 00:24:16.998]  The artist blew up a Christmas tree, a very large Christmas tree, on the National Mall while we all applauded.
[00:24:20.723 --> 00:24:24.057]  I thought it was quite impressive, but I had doubts.
[00:24:30.273 --> 00:24:36.175]  Why are we paying this money to blow up a Christmas tree a few weeks before Christmas?
[00:24:37.055 --> 00:24:40.576]  So I asked the defector from China, who is this artist?
[00:24:42.097 --> 00:24:44.498]  How well known is he back in China?
[00:24:45.358 --> 00:24:51.100]  And the defector brought up some amazing material that this artist is particularly nationalistic.
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:58.122]  His favorite book is a book about how to use cyber warfare to bring Wall Street to its knees.
[00:25:01.226 --> 00:25:10.494]  This artist we had paid so much and made a star ourselves turned out to be quite nationalistic in his attitudes toward America.
[00:25:13.456 --> 00:25:14.998]  Look how far things have gone.
[00:25:16.199 --> 00:25:18.961]  We pay to have our own symbols destroyed.
[00:25:38.945 --> 00:25:43.028]  And joining me now is award-winning Canadian television producer Jonathan Roth.
[00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:51.555]  Your work has been featured on the television biography channel, the Discovery Channel, and of course you're the executive producer at Roth Multimedia.
[00:25:51.595 --> 00:25:59.461]  And if people want to go ahead and watch this film, they just need to go to caseyresearch.com slash china and they can find your work there.
[00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:01.223]  Jonathan, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:26:01.843 --> 00:26:08.108]  Now we just watched a scene from your film where basically I was kind of flabbergasted.
[00:26:08.148 --> 00:26:12.973]  Here we are actively destroying our own symbols and then calling it art.
[00:26:13.633 --> 00:26:14.214]  Being mocked.
[00:26:15.848 --> 00:26:29.393]  Yeah, you know what, that clip, basically when Michael Pillsbury, who's the gentleman who's in the clip, the former Undersecretary of Defense, and has been the Pentagon's top China expert for decades, really, he told me that story.
[00:26:30.533 --> 00:26:43.118]  And when I went to go look for the footage, actually, of this Christmas tree, because I figured someone must have shot this given the size of the event that Mr. Pillsbury described, and so long story short, the Smithsonian
[00:26:43.678 --> 00:26:45.059]  was the one that shot the event.
[00:26:45.239 --> 00:26:48.401]  And they have footage of this Christmas tree exploding all over the internet.
[00:26:49.042 --> 00:26:57.767]  And I secured the footage from YouTube, brought it into the documentary, was cutting it, and then I approached the Smithsonian looking to, you know, pay for the rights to use it.
[00:26:58.308 --> 00:27:07.314]  So, long story short, after many, much of a back and forth, that I instantly realized that they were putting up walls, finally they agreed
[00:27:07.814 --> 00:27:08.475]  We're good to go.
[00:27:31.992 --> 00:27:34.472]  Like it to in terms of allowing you to use this footage.
[00:27:35.333 --> 00:27:39.633]  You're going to actually have to approach the artist himself to license it.
[00:27:40.053 --> 00:27:43.014]  So I continue to ask him, look, who actually shot this footage?
[00:27:43.414 --> 00:27:49.735]  The people in the credits of the video clip, I searched each of them to see what their background is.
[00:27:49.795 --> 00:27:54.956]  They all work for the Smithsonian, and yet you want me to go to this Chinese artist to license the footage.
[00:27:55.956 --> 00:27:58.437]  And he said, unfortunately, that is what you're going to have to do.
[00:27:58.577 --> 00:27:59.197]  And ultimately,
[00:27:59.497 --> 00:28:07.982]  He actually agreed with me that I did fit the categories to allow the production to use the clips, but that they were just uncomfortable with me using it.
[00:28:08.342 --> 00:28:11.024]  So that was the first element that I thought was rather odd.
[00:28:11.084 --> 00:28:14.186]  Here's a US government body blocking me from using this footage.
[00:28:15.006 --> 00:28:17.628]  And of course, the Associated Press has it, so I licensed it from them.
[00:28:18.088 --> 00:28:23.772]  But the second part of the story, which I find incredibly fascinating, is that Thursday of this week,
[00:28:25.193 --> 00:28:44.486]  Basically, I was forwarded this by a close colleague, friend of mine, who said that CNN, on their Facebook page, had just posted essentially a puff piece article about this Chinese artist, that the article was actually written back in April, and it's like they recycled and pushed it out there again, which I thought
[00:28:45.146 --> 00:28:47.467]  You know, I've been in the news business myself for many years.
[00:28:47.587 --> 00:29:01.674]  There are really no coincidences, and I just thought that's rather odd that an article about him would come out the same week that, you know, a clip from my film that essentially shows them mocking the United States and any symbols that are, you know, American in origin.
[00:29:01.694 --> 00:29:02.634]  Right.
[00:29:03.014 --> 00:29:06.616]  Especially there with Hillary Clinton praising it and everything.
[00:29:06.636 --> 00:29:11.819]  So they, of course, needed to challenge the vision that you put out there about this art project.
[00:29:11.879 --> 00:29:12.079]  I mean,
[00:29:12.699 --> 00:29:14.600]  He's a great guy, so don't challenge that.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.762]  I mean, Adolf Hitler made the cover of Time Magazine.
[00:29:16.822 --> 00:29:18.503]  He was their man of the year at one point.
[00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:25.207]  So talk to me a little bit about this secret plan that you exposed.
[00:29:25.247 --> 00:29:27.088]  China's carefully studied the U.S.
[00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:29.710]  and their rise to become a global superpower.
[00:29:30.331 --> 00:29:32.032]  How are they working to undermine the U.S.? ?
[00:29:33.038 --> 00:29:46.786]  Sure, well you know what, I think the best way to describe it is that Michael Pillsbury, the gentleman I just referred to, Undersecretary of Defense of the United States, the Pentagon's top China expert for decades, wrote a stunningly good book called The Hundred Year Marathon.
[00:29:47.406 --> 00:29:55.891]  It came out I guess maybe a couple of years ago, two, three years ago, and in that he was really the guy that for the longest time he actually was very supportive of U.S.
[00:29:56.431 --> 00:29:56.892]  I think so.
[00:30:13.571 --> 00:30:14.132]  We're good to go.
[00:30:30.473 --> 00:30:35.155]  That he exposed the progression that China has made towards trying to attain this.
[00:30:35.555 --> 00:30:40.798]  Now, really, the documentary film, what I've tried to do is tell the story of how the U.S.
[00:30:41.098 --> 00:30:41.838]  rose to the top.
[00:30:41.958 --> 00:30:47.701]  Basically, in 1945, the British Empire was exhausted and essentially the U.S.
[00:30:47.861 --> 00:30:49.182]  knew that this was going to happen.
[00:30:49.202 --> 00:30:51.243]  They'd been lending them a lot of money to fight the war.
[00:30:52.243 --> 00:31:04.168]  And at the end of World War II, essentially set up this meeting, Bretton Woods, and through that and through some other mechanisms, really took control of the world and has pointed the world in an American direction for a long time.
[00:31:04.948 --> 00:31:18.034]  But the Cold War stepped in and that really changed the focus of these institutions that were set up under Bretton Woods, things like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, or the IMF, and the world's unrivaled reserve currency, the U.S.
[00:31:18.074 --> 00:31:18.354]  dollar.
[00:31:18.974 --> 00:31:23.777]  And essentially those vehicles were used to support U.S.
[00:31:23.857 --> 00:31:32.541]  efforts to maintain hegemony over top of the Soviet Union and shape the world really in their image.
[00:31:33.222 --> 00:31:36.864]  And I think you can make a really cogent argument that's exactly what they did.
[00:31:37.784 --> 00:31:46.569]  But in the film we interview a gentleman by the name of John Perkins who's the author of a book, maybe some of your viewers might be familiar with, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[00:31:47.129 --> 00:32:00.181]  And John tells the story of the president of Ecuador that he himself was personally involved with in terms of trying to get this president, his name was Jaime Roldos, to accept U.S.
[00:32:00.241 --> 00:32:06.607]  loans from the World Bank and essentially to corrupt this president to allow more U.S.
[00:32:06.627 --> 00:32:07.587]  influence in Ecuador.
[00:32:08.348 --> 00:32:12.971]  And ultimately, the President did not want to do this, and he was killed.
[00:32:13.611 --> 00:32:20.775]  And it's Perkins' contention, and I mean, he was there, he met with the President, is his contention that he was assassinated by the United States.
[00:32:21.035 --> 00:32:27.159]  And what I would argue is that I think, from the facts that I looked into, I'd say that's probably the case.
[00:32:28.099 --> 00:32:51.006]  But I think maybe more to the point, I think that there are two elements that really point to the fact that there's no question that this is probably what happened, is that to this day Ecuador itself believes this, and that is why Julian Assange is sitting in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and why Ecuador offered Edward Snowden asylum after he initially released all those documents and fled Hong Kong.
[00:32:51.626 --> 00:32:56.268]  Tune into the InfoWars Nightly News Monday for part two of our interview with Jonathan Roth.
[00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:07.990]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.051]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.451 --> 00:33:12.493]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.174 --> 00:33:13.634]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:16.436]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.756 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.877 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all of the essential amino acids, all of the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.568 --> 00:34:49.088]  A thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.686]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.026 --> 00:36:46.687]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.

[00:37:04.383 --> 00:37:16.076]  This is Ashley Beckford reporting for InfoWars.com, and I'm here to tell you how the federal government is actually grabbing guns from law-abiding citizens.
[00:37:16.497 --> 00:37:19.080]  I have an article here from the Associated Press.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:20.080]  U.S.
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:25.084]  court upholds ban on gun sales to marijuana cardholders.
[00:37:25.504 --> 00:37:34.671]  A federal ban on the sale of guns to medical marijuana cardholders does not violate the Second Amendment, according to a federal appeals court.
[00:37:35.111 --> 00:37:37.233]  This ruling was by the 9th U.S.
[00:37:37.313 --> 00:37:50.747]  Circuit Court of Appeals, and it applies to the nine western states that fall under the court's jurisdiction, which includes California, Washington, and Oregon, our medical and recreational cannabis states.
[00:37:51.147 --> 00:38:03.833]  Now, this lawsuit was filed by S. Rowan Wilson, a Nevada woman who tried to buy a firearm simply for self-defense in 2011 after she had already obtained a medical marijuana card.
[00:38:04.273 --> 00:38:07.835]  As we know, marijuana remains illegal under federal law.
[00:38:08.275 --> 00:38:16.162]  Even though Wilson is not a marijuana user, she obtained the card in an expression of support for marijuana legalization.
[00:38:16.502 --> 00:38:25.930]  But in this unanimous decision, these judges are assuming that medical marijuana card users are more likely to use the drug.
[00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:35.898]  They're saying that this use of cannabis raises your risk of irrational and unpredictable behavior with which a gun should not be associated.
[00:38:36.298 --> 00:38:52.381]  Wilson's attorney is saying he's going to appeal the decision and he's going to either present it to the same panel of judges that issued the original ruling, a larger panel of that same circuit court, or he's going to take it all the way to the U.S.
[00:38:52.741 --> 00:38:53.602]  Supreme Court.
[00:38:53.882 --> 00:38:59.963]  And he's saying that even if you're on the no-fly list, your constitutional right is still protected.
[00:39:01.041 --> 00:39:08.162]  Wilson says that her gun rights were actually stripped without due process, and I would actually agree with her.
[00:39:08.502 --> 00:39:15.583]  The bottom line is this, the irrational and unpredictable behavior is actually coming straight from the federal government.
[00:39:15.924 --> 00:39:23.645]  We have a patent from the Department of Health and Human Services issued in 2003, patent number 6630507, cannabinoids as antioxidants and neuroprotectants.
[00:39:30.706 --> 00:39:50.153]  We have the federal government who is actually saying blatantly, even though cannabis is a Schedule 1 drug that they're saying has no medical benefit, no medicinal benefit whatsoever, they're saying blatantly in this patent that they issued and was approved in 2003 that cannabis actually is a medicine.
[00:39:53.283 --> 00:40:06.953]  Although the people who are under this district court ruling that was just made are disproportionately going to be affected until the Supreme Court ruling or another ruling has been made, it really is affecting all Americans right now.
[00:40:07.254 --> 00:40:10.876]  This is just another way for the government to strip people's gun rights.
[00:40:11.297 --> 00:40:19.803]  We know that veterans can go into the VA and say that they're depressed or that they have PTSD and they're actually being stripped of their gun rights.
[00:40:20.203 --> 00:40:28.227]  Many veterans actually can use medical cannabis and there have been studies done to help them with the things that they've gone through, through the fog of war.
[00:40:29.147 --> 00:40:34.930]  How can a federal government be legitimate when it actually criminalizes people who have served this country?
[00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:42.733]  How can a federal government be legitimate when it wants to throw out the Constitution, the founding documents of our country?
[00:40:43.233 --> 00:40:44.114]  The thing is this,
[00:40:44.594 --> 00:40:54.319]  I asked you to compare the number of people who have actually died from cannabis use versus people who have died from converting to Islam.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:41:00.803]  When you put those two statistics next to each other, the juxtaposition is really shocking.
[00:41:01.243 --> 00:41:02.704]  The bottom line is this.
[00:41:03.104 --> 00:41:05.125]  No one's rights should be infringed.
[00:41:05.526 --> 00:41:12.569]  I agree with Tyson Beckford when he was talking about Matt Damon on TMZ and he said we should be 2A all day.
[00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:14.351]  I'm with him.
[00:41:14.551 --> 00:41:17.974]  This is Ashley Beckford reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:20.337]  Stay tuned for more special reports.
[00:41:32.987 --> 00:41:33.467]  Who are you?
[00:41:34.668 --> 00:41:36.128]  I am the Architect.
[00:41:36.969 --> 00:41:38.309]  I created the Matrix.
[00:41:38.709 --> 00:41:43.131]  Just how deep does the Matrix of the programming of the general public go?
[00:41:43.411 --> 00:41:48.873]  Would it surprise you to discover just how subtle and obvious the programming truly is?
[00:41:49.313 --> 00:41:58.737]  Back in 2011, InfoWars spoke with Cuban-born journalist Alex Abaya about the RAND Corporation's infiltration of the American psyche.
[00:41:58.917 --> 00:42:06.541]  What Rand actually did during the 1950s is that they came up with this particular way of looking at the world that changed everything.
[00:42:06.942 --> 00:42:08.622]  That changed the world we live in.
[00:42:08.662 --> 00:42:18.408]  That changed how we think, how we talk, the schools we send our kids to, how we pay our taxes, the planes we fly in.
[00:42:18.428 --> 00:42:19.489]  They've changed the whole world.
[00:42:19.529 --> 00:42:23.771]  They developed something called rational choice theory that
[00:42:24.855 --> 00:42:25.075]  After
[00:42:42.574 --> 00:42:46.615]  What really counts is what they call the consumer sovereignty, or the sovereignty of the consumer.
[00:42:47.315 --> 00:42:56.838]  Where what counts is not what we do, or who we believe in, or what God we pray to, but how much money we're going to spend, and what's in it for me.
[00:42:58.658 --> 00:42:58.998]  Choice.
[00:43:00.359 --> 00:43:01.579]  The problem is choice.
[00:43:01.939 --> 00:43:09.521]  The rational choice theory has gradually been inundated in American culture for at the very least five generations.
[00:43:09.761 --> 00:43:11.502]  The Matrix is older than you know.
[00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:18.871]  I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.
[00:43:19.111 --> 00:43:22.831]  The Rand Corporation is at the heart of the New World Order.
[00:43:22.872 --> 00:43:30.173]  It's part of that inner coterie, or almost a group of ring-wraith organizations that serve this dark system.
[00:43:31.013 --> 00:43:32.814]  And the Rand Corporation
[00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:42.157]  Literally, if you research the white papers they put out to the public, it has set the policy that we are now living under in this country.
[00:43:42.177 --> 00:43:46.941]  And they have the nerve to locate themselves, get the street named.
[00:43:49.433 --> 00:43:59.018]  1776.
[00:43:50.314 --> 00:43:59.018]  Simply put, it's far easier to control a nation of mindless consumers than free-thinking individuals with strong beliefs.
[00:43:59.499 --> 00:44:05.622]  Globalist think tanks, the RAND Corporation, the CFR, hand-in-hand with the CIA and the Pentagon,
[00:44:05.962 --> 00:44:14.888]  Have developed and customized unyielding psyops on the American people, bringing us to the state of dysfunction we all experience today.
[00:44:15.128 --> 00:44:20.612]  After leaving the Washington Post in 1977, Carl Bernstein wrote for Rolling Stone.
[00:44:21.092 --> 00:44:26.416]  In 1953, Joseph Alsop, then one of America's leading syndicated columnists,
[00:44:26.716 --> 00:44:28.877]  Went to the Philippines to cover an election.
[00:44:29.077 --> 00:44:32.459]  He did not go because he was asked to do so by his syndicate.
[00:44:32.559 --> 00:44:37.402]  He did not go because he was asked to do so by the newspapers that printed his column.
[00:44:37.622 --> 00:44:40.283]  He went at the request of the CIA.
[00:44:40.603 --> 00:44:54.571]  Alsop is one of more than 400 American journalists who in the past 25 years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents on file at CIA headquarters.
[00:44:55.071 --> 00:45:05.715]  Fast forward to the present day, and those same meddling internal forces have grown a mutated PSYOP into monstrous proportions in the form of Black Lives Matter.
[00:45:05.935 --> 00:45:23.762]  The Washington Times recently revealed that the Ford Foundation and Borealis Philanthropy recently announced the formation of the Black-Led Movement Fund, BLMF, a six-year pooled donor campaign aimed at raising $100 million for the movement for Black Lives Coalition.
[00:45:24.122 --> 00:45:39.488]  That funding comes in addition to more than $33 million in grants to the Black Lives Matter movement from top Democratic Party donor George Soros through his Open Society Foundations, as well as grant-making from the Center for American Progress.
[00:45:39.708 --> 00:45:40.248]  Well, yes.
[00:45:40.368 --> 00:45:48.231]  I mean, there's been always a link between think tanks and the big, powerful economic interests.
[00:45:48.491 --> 00:45:53.713]  Specifically, in the case of RAND, there's been a link between RAND and the Ford Foundation.
[00:45:54.033 --> 00:46:09.199]  The Ford Foundation has been providing cover as a CIA funding arm since the Cold War, and Borealis Philanthropy has been expanding funding to bring in an invasion of illegal immigrants into the United States, raising over $90 million in 8 years.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:29.684]  America is being eaten away from the inside out and it's getting easier and easier as more and more Americans isolate themselves from their fellow citizens and their inherited responsibility to be mindful of the overwhelming evidence that we are being smothered under a blanket of globalism.
[00:46:29.944 --> 00:46:31.845]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:46:44.758 --> 00:46:46.559]  This is a protest.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.102]  And this is a riot.
[00:46:49.502 --> 00:46:53.305]  If you can't tell the difference, then you are part of the problem.
[00:46:53.745 --> 00:46:54.746]  InfoWars.com

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.264 --> 00:48:53.184]  We're good to go.
[00:49:08.766 --> 00:49:14.968]  Well, in this era of information overload, it's become incredibly easy to spread false information.
[00:49:15.028 --> 00:49:24.391]  It's so easy to just skim through the headlines and press retweet or send out to your trusted friends, and then you're the one that ends up looking like a total idiot.
[00:49:24.811 --> 00:49:28.293]  Now, Margaret, I'm sure most of us have fallen victim to this a time or two.
[00:49:29.833 --> 00:49:39.614]  Some of these fake agencies do this, of course, for the clicks and the ad revenue, but there are actually some nefarious actors out there who are spreading this disinformation on purpose.
[00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:40.517]  That's right.
[00:49:40.597 --> 00:49:44.399]  So what we're talking about specifically, there was a Soros video that was leaked.
[00:49:44.479 --> 00:49:49.122]  It was taped and heavily edited at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
[00:49:49.262 --> 00:49:52.163]  And it sounded like he said that they were going to steal the election.
[00:49:52.203 --> 00:49:59.707]  Now, had we run with that story and published it, they would have then promptly released the transcript and go, okay, you guys are a fake news agency.
[00:49:59.747 --> 00:50:00.647]  Look at what you did.
[00:50:01.048 --> 00:50:03.889]  You can't even tell that this was a heavily edited, edited video.
[00:50:04.429 --> 00:50:06.490]  And producers were able to determine that it was.
[00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:09.512]  And then we obviously didn't do a story on it, but had we done,
[00:50:09.932 --> 00:50:15.035]  You know, you see pieces like this that are supposed to be comical, like the fried rat that KFC does that turns out to be a hoax.
[00:50:15.075 --> 00:50:18.858]  But something like this, you lose credibility if you take the bait.
[00:50:19.338 --> 00:50:19.558]  Right.
[00:50:19.618 --> 00:50:23.841]  And now this video is actually featured in the Trump subreddit, The Donald.
[00:50:24.441 --> 00:50:25.222]  There's a whole
[00:50:25.782 --> 00:50:26.242]  I think so.
[00:50:54.210 --> 00:51:06.129]  I think it's all, it's going to lead to a landslide for Donald Trump in the popular vote, not in the electoral vote.
[00:51:07.028 --> 00:51:15.032]  So I know it's hard to tell because of the way George Soros just sort of mumbles like an evil cretin, but his lips are not moving saying Donald Trump.
[00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:19.834]  You can see that they altered that to make it appear as though he's saying Donald Trump.
[00:51:19.874 --> 00:51:21.374]  He's actually saying Hillary Clinton.
[00:51:21.775 --> 00:51:26.297]  And this video actually came out in January of 2016.
[00:51:26.977 --> 00:51:27.997]  Bloomberg reported on it.
[00:51:28.017 --> 00:51:30.959]  Soros, Clinton to win popular vote in a landslide.
[00:51:31.599 --> 00:51:45.423]  And so having this video, Making the Rounds, being heavily edited like this, is just going to fall into this narrative that they're pushing that whatever comes out with these DC leaks, it has been altered by Russian hackers.
[00:51:45.743 --> 00:51:54.326]  And so that is the problem with putting out stories like that without checking the sources, without taking a little common sense, doing a little more digging, because you can
[00:51:54.966 --> 00:51:59.029]  You can go in and basically write what George Soros purportedly said.
[00:51:59.109 --> 00:52:00.790]  That would have been big time news.
[00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:03.972]  It would have made it to the New York Times, frankly, if that had been true.
[00:52:04.152 --> 00:52:15.760]  It makes everything else that we're saying illegitimate if we are proven to be false on that one thing when, you know, we're reporting the truth as best we can and really coming to the best research that we spend, frankly, hours doing.
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.922]  And, you know, thankfully we caught that and that was an easy one.
[00:52:18.962 --> 00:52:22.664]  But speaking of fake stories regarding Soros, you want to talk about a fake story?
[00:52:22.684 --> 00:52:23.445]  We're talking about a man
[00:52:23.985 --> 00:52:31.609]  Who backs up and props up protesters to destabilize places like Ukraine, for example, and he'll use the same group of protesters.
[00:52:31.649 --> 00:52:38.173]  I was looking at footage once and you could see one protester two years later, he's in, he's in Ukraine protesting with the Maidan.
[00:52:38.193 --> 00:52:40.515]  It's like, wait a second, who the hell is this guy?
[00:52:40.535 --> 00:52:46.338]  You know, you talk about fake stories, they are out there, but, but for us, we do the best that we can bringing you the truth.
[00:52:46.738 --> 00:52:50.841]  You know, as it lies on the earth, and you know, that's just the way that it is.
[00:52:50.921 --> 00:52:58.087]  So there are fake stories out there, but you know, we're talking about a master of lies there, and his Hungarian accent, very easy to muddle.
[00:52:58.167 --> 00:53:00.168]  It's difficult to understand what he's saying half the time.
[00:53:00.468 --> 00:53:10.756]  Well, and there's a very good article that was put out yesterday, Rachel Alexander wrote it, and she points out how the left is busily planting fake red meat conservative news sites.
[00:53:11.156 --> 00:53:15.439]  So they are, these are stories that are being specifically
[00:53:16.471 --> 00:53:19.974]  Targeted to conservatives and they're just they're too good to be true.
[00:53:19.994 --> 00:53:24.939]  And that's why they call them red meat Just throw throw the dogs this they're gonna salivate over this red meat.
[00:53:25.459 --> 00:53:42.955]  And so these are They're not even satire news sites half the time and but basically according to this author She was told by an insider that the strategy is to fool so many conservatives into spreading a ridiculous fake article That finally a prominent elected official will fall for it
[00:53:43.255 --> 00:53:43.496]  We're good.
[00:54:01.434 --> 00:54:01.694]  Right.
[00:54:01.794 --> 00:54:05.497]  So, you know, and the way that news works, it's an aggregated thing.
[00:54:05.557 --> 00:54:12.183]  So, uh, if you're a reporter in the field, you, you look at the AP, you look at what other people are reporting on and you aggregate information.
[00:54:12.203 --> 00:54:13.304]  That's how it spreads quickly.
[00:54:13.344 --> 00:54:22.971]  But the fact that they're losing the narrative, they're losing the information more so badly that they resulted a planning fake stories because, oh, they're racist bigot crap is no longer working.
[00:54:23.072 --> 00:54:26.895]  Now we have to actually go 180 degrees and start spinning fake crap.
[00:54:27.395 --> 00:54:29.337]  So that maybe one of you idiots will fall for it.
[00:54:29.557 --> 00:54:29.757]  Right.
[00:54:29.817 --> 00:54:37.063]  And that's, and it's also to just sort of destabilize the whole information system that's out there because now you don't know who to trust.
[00:54:37.523 --> 00:54:42.647]  And they're really pushing this narrative that the Russians, they were behind the DNC leaks.
[00:54:42.667 --> 00:54:44.729]  They pushed that out there right away with no proof.
[00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:47.611]  And then, oh, by the way, there's going to be an October surprise.
[00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:52.895]  They're going to be releasing a lot of things on Hillary Clinton that are going to be very damaging to her, but we can't trust it.
[00:54:53.175 --> 00:54:58.159]  Because the Russians have already gone in and altered the data that's in there and the metadata with those emails.
[00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:05.286]  And so they're going to take a video like this and say, look, see how we told you the George Soros material was altered?
[00:55:05.346 --> 00:55:06.487]  This video is proof of that.
[00:55:06.527 --> 00:55:09.029]  You can't trust anything that comes out about Clinton.
[00:55:09.129 --> 00:55:09.649]  I mean, this is...
[00:55:10.894 --> 00:55:12.315]  It's pretty genius level.
[00:55:12.335 --> 00:55:13.395]  She's so desperate.
[00:55:14.055 --> 00:55:18.437]  She asserted that the Kremlin was responsible for the alt-right movement here in the U.S.
[00:55:18.477 --> 00:55:26.180]  I mean, the woman is so freaking desperate, she thinks that Putin is behind the alternative right movement going on here.
[00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:29.462]  Maybe it's just people are really fed up with you and they see past you.
[00:55:30.722 --> 00:55:38.445]  She insinuated in a video earlier, I was watching it, that Putin didn't have a soul, to which he snaps back, I might not have a soul, but at least I have a brain.
[00:55:41.147 --> 00:55:43.309]  They're too smart to be doing this, Leigh-Anne.
[00:55:43.329 --> 00:55:48.674]  They're not as watered down as we think they are in terms of the truth that they have.
[00:55:48.934 --> 00:55:52.037]  And that's why they're truly frightened right now.
[00:55:52.097 --> 00:55:59.064]  And that's why they're resorting to putting out these fake stories, to just turning Russia once again into the boogeyman.
[00:55:59.164 --> 00:56:04.328]  Because that's all they have, is they're going to stir up all this controversy that, oh, the Russians are trying to swing the election.
[00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:06.849]  They're coming after Hillary Clinton.
[00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.430]  He's in charge of the alt-right.
[00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:20.513]  Now, Julian Assange came out and said that this is absolutely crazy, the claims are false, and a conspiracy, in fact, to say that WikiLeaks is working on behalf of the Russians.
[00:56:20.593 --> 00:56:30.695]  And he goes on to point out how there are plenty of stuff on WikiLeaks that it talks about Moscow and calls them out because he says that's not... WikiLeaks isn't for any political body.
[00:56:30.755 --> 00:56:33.676]  It's to just expose corruption within the political sphere.
[00:56:34.156 --> 00:56:34.996]  I think she's getting that.
[00:56:35.016 --> 00:56:45.539]  So Julian Assange was featured on English speaking Russian television a lot originally because, um, they had the airtime here in the US and globally and he, you know, they gave him a lot of airtime originally.
[00:56:45.579 --> 00:56:50.020]  She might be trying to link that because of that, but he in no way is a paid Kremlin actor.
[00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:50.920]  That's hilarious.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:56.202]  If anything, you know, he's just a man who likes the truth like the rest of us do and he's paid dearly for it.
[00:56:56.242 --> 00:57:00.183]  We're talking about a man that's held up in an embassy and he has been for years and he probably will die there.
[00:57:00.683 --> 00:57:02.565]  Because he likes the truth so much.
[00:57:02.645 --> 00:57:09.330]  So we need to kind of examine people's motivations, especially hers, this very dark, bad actor.
[00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:18.677]  And you guys sometimes don't like that term when I use it, but it's the most polite way that I can say that in an international relations term without calling her a despotic devil woman.
[00:57:18.717 --> 00:57:19.998]  That's what I really want to say.
[00:57:20.899 --> 00:57:22.440]  Question people's motivation.
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.381]  That's what I would go back to.
[00:57:23.601 --> 00:57:25.902]  Absolutely, and also check your sources.
[00:57:26.022 --> 00:57:44.951]  I know it's very tempting a lot of the time to just go ahead and quickly share an article or retweet something, but you have to understand that there is a concerted effort, especially this election cycle, when the population is waking up, they're not being controlled by all of the information war that's out there, that they've tried so hard to push out propaganda.
[00:57:45.351 --> 00:57:46.471]  They see it's not working.
[00:57:46.791 --> 00:57:51.253]  So now they're actively working to just try and make you look foolish and discredited.
[00:57:51.813 --> 00:58:00.775]  And so then your friends on Facebook can make fun of you because they're saying, you know, you're a Trump supporter and you're an idiot that you would believe this story.
[00:58:00.815 --> 00:58:03.076]  You can't even tell it's heavily edited or something like that.
[00:58:03.136 --> 00:58:03.776]  That's true.
[00:58:03.936 --> 00:58:08.337]  So do your research, do your due diligence, as we would say, and make sure
[00:58:08.757 --> 00:58:19.907]  And even putting a simple link into Google, or, you know, I'm really not a fan of Google so I don't want to endorse them at this moment, but doing your basic search would pop some things up for you that you might want to check pre-post.
[00:58:20.047 --> 00:58:20.267]  Yes.
[00:58:20.287 --> 00:58:20.647]  Great advice.
