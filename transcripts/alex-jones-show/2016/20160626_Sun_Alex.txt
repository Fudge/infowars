[00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:15.373]  You have the power.
[00:00:15.713 --> 00:00:17.274]  Humanity has the power.
[00:00:17.694 --> 00:00:18.795]  We have the power.
[00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:19.876]  Do you want to fight?
[00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:22.237]  You better believe you got one!
[00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:29.002]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:29.582 --> 00:00:31.063]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:36.867]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am back in the saddle.
[00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:38.908]  Back in the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:40.309]  Back in the crow's nest.
[00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:41.750]  In the cockpit.
[00:00:43.352 --> 00:00:44.623]  And I am ready!
[00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.652]  Wow!
[00:00:48.376 --> 00:00:54.700]  The Supreme Court ruled that Obama can't keep bringing illegals in and violating the law, so he came out and said, I don't care what they say, I'm going to continue it.
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.601]  But it gets worse.
[00:00:56.041 --> 00:01:00.024]  It's mainstream news that the UN is actually running the program.
[00:01:00.064 --> 00:01:02.926]  We already told you that, but it's now in mainstream news.
[00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:04.307]  Mainstream TV is reporting it.
[00:01:05.187 --> 00:01:09.650]  Let's go to this report, though, on the British exit and how big this really is for everybody out there.
[00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.632]  This is a devastating victory for humanity.
[00:01:12.352 --> 00:01:14.093]  I'm telling you, we are turning the tide.
[00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:17.295]  We've not completely won yet, but this is a massive event.
[00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:18.236]  Here's John Bowne reporting.
[00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:21.798]  The New World Order is getting its butt kicked at high noon.
[00:01:22.078 --> 00:01:38.829]  Thankfully, the highly suspicious demise of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has, for the time being, not been a factor in the Supreme Court's decision on Obama's dangerously lawless immigration policy, as Obama pushes the country to the brink of anarchy.
[00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:47.255]  Of course, it didn't take long for the Obama administration to thumb its nose at the deadlocked judicial branch and the will of the American people.
[00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:51.857]  Deferred action policy that has been in place for the last four years is not affected by this rule.
[00:01:53.018 --> 00:01:58.081]  Enforcement priorities developed by my administration are not affected by this ruling.
[00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:13.389]  This means that the people who might have benefited from the expanded deferred action policies, long-term residents, raising children who are Americans or legal residents, they will remain low priorities for enforcement
[00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:26.521]  But like a castle made of sand, the fragile globalist secret world government has been dealt a strong blow by the waves of consciousness, inevitably finding a way to the shore of a free world.
[00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:41.145]  Adan Salazar writes, Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK's Independence Party, which played a huge part in mobilizing UK citizens behind the Brexit, speculated the momentum behind the results could usher in a Trump presidency.
[00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:51.934]  With the Brexit debacle landing in the laps of the self-serving, arrogant Bilderberg scum, a propulsion of liberty is accelerating, and the globalists know it.
[00:02:52.134 --> 00:02:54.736]  Brace yourself for planetary turbulence.
[00:02:54.997 --> 00:03:06.927]  The New World Order will either go quietly in the night, as they wisely should, or their maniacal desperation to rule the world will result in more false flags and order out of chaos.
[00:03:07.347 --> 00:03:12.208]  Ultimately winding its way down the path toward a very public downfall.
[00:03:12.388 --> 00:03:15.909]  People have been asking, how will the Brexit affect the United States?
[00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:17.829]  Will it impact the stock market?
[00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:19.910]  The Federal Reserve's interest rate?
[00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.130]  Global diplomatic relations?
[00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.112]  These questions are all based on a ruinous stagnant counterfeit system devouring the sovereignty of nations
[00:03:29.352 --> 00:03:32.557]  That must be finally recognized and dismantled.
[00:03:32.697 --> 00:03:44.575]  Presidential candidate Donald Trump congratulated the UK for voting to assert its independence from the EU and encouraged the American people in November to also assert their independence from the global elite.
[00:03:44.827 --> 00:03:53.074]  You know, I said this was going to happen, and I think that it's a great thing, and we will see, but I think it's going to be a great thing.
[00:03:53.374 --> 00:03:55.535]  Basically, they took back their country.
[00:03:55.555 --> 00:03:56.456]  That's a great thing.
[00:03:56.576 --> 00:04:03.662]  Following the British vote to exit the EU, Trump said the election results marked a shift toward more nationalistic tendencies.
[00:04:03.882 --> 00:04:06.504]  The Trump campaign said in a statement, Trump continued,
[00:04:29.384 --> 00:04:32.545]  It will soon be time to believe in America again.
[00:04:32.925 --> 00:04:44.109]  As InfoWars has reported countless times, the idea for the European Union globalist super state came directly out of discussions held at the secretive Bilderberg Group conference in 1955.
[00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:53.015]  At which European politicians consider the necessity to bring German people into a common European market as quickly as possible.
[00:04:53.235 --> 00:04:59.961]  The lunacy of the global elite can't survive once their dark secrets are completely exposed.
[00:05:00.261 --> 00:05:06.807]  Thomas Jefferson once said, nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goals.
[00:05:07.047 --> 00:05:10.030]  And nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong.
[00:05:10.822 --> 00:05:12.183]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:05:12.463 --> 00:05:13.744]  You can't survive without it.
[00:05:13.964 --> 00:05:14.844]  But where do you get it?
[00:05:15.164 --> 00:05:20.908]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:05:21.148 --> 00:05:26.871]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:43.935]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:05:44.315 --> 00:05:46.435]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:05:46.796 --> 00:05:47.996]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:05:48.276 --> 00:05:49.036]  Easy assembly.
[00:05:49.296 --> 00:05:49.916]  Low maintenance.
[00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.036]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:06:19.218 --> 00:06:26.107]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:44.133 --> 00:06:47.974]  It is Sunday, the 26th day of June 2016.
[00:06:48.014 --> 00:06:50.494]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:50.514 --> 00:06:53.655]  We'll be here live for the next two hours as we are every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:53.695 --> 00:07:05.377]  Central Live and re-aired on fine AM and FM affiliates across the United States blasting out across the world via the somewhat still free World Wide Web, the Internet.
[00:07:07.617 --> 00:07:10.558]  My friends, obviously we have a full plate this evening.
[00:07:11.803 --> 00:07:14.305]  Don't forget, we have the weekday broadcast as well, 11 a.m.
[00:07:14.325 --> 00:07:14.905]  to 3 p.m.
[00:07:14.965 --> 00:07:18.908]  Central, and also re-aired on Fine Affiliates across the United States.
[00:07:18.928 --> 00:07:33.218]  You can always find the free audio and video feeds, the free iPhone, Android apps, and podcast links, and more at InfoWars.com forward slash show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:36.181]  Those of you that are awake, those of you that know what's happening,
[00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:42.245]  You can see that the fight against globalism, the fight against world government, has now been drug out in the open.
[00:07:43.146 --> 00:07:53.894]  And the forces of human liberty and self-determination and sovereignty of the individual and the nation-state, of the man and the woman, are now becoming central.
[00:07:54.374 --> 00:08:01.300]  They've denied this globalist program was going on forever, because if you deny reality and people live in a fantasy land, well then you're never threatened as an elite.
[00:08:02.193 --> 00:08:11.387]  But we, in the liberty movement worldwide, the pro-human, pro-Renaissance, true liberal movement that Thomas Jefferson is the greatest example of.
[00:08:13.422 --> 00:08:15.923]  ...are beginning to win the info war on every front.
[00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:20.724]  The globalists still have the centralized control, but they've robbed it fraudulently.
[00:08:21.144 --> 00:08:24.245]  They have gotten into control by deceit, and it is illegitimate.
[00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:25.566]  It is fraud.
[00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:27.366]  It is no and void.
[00:08:27.666 --> 00:08:28.407]  We're on the march.
[00:08:28.827 --> 00:08:32.848]  The global technotronic technocracy is on the run.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:55.687]  Obviously the Brexit took place Thursday and despite massive election fraud with people's votes being reversed and harassment and demonization campaigns, England voted to get out of the European Union because it maintained some of its sovereignty when it entered the UK.
[00:08:57.767 --> 00:09:02.229]  But now Scotland is threatening to try to block that vote along with Northern Ireland.
[00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:08.101]  Which shows why it's not good to ever waive your rights into a larger so-called union.
[00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:11.302]  But this is a devastating victory.
[00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:12.503]  The fight's not over.
[00:09:13.223 --> 00:09:29.750]  But once you admit there's a world government, once you admit the EU is a central hub of that, once the statements of the former head of the EU, Herman Van Rompuy and others about, we're establishing world government through the EU, merging with the American Union and the Asian Union, I mean, these are real video clips.
[00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.687]  That I have in my film, The Obama Deception.
[00:09:33.267 --> 00:09:35.028]  That I have in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:09:35.668 --> 00:09:47.633]  I mean, I have scores of these clips of British Prime Ministers and US Senators and German Chancellors saying, we're establishing a private global corporate government with world taxes through the EU.
[00:09:48.634 --> 00:09:49.534]  It is the model of it.
[00:09:50.035 --> 00:09:54.256]  We're going to get rid of our borders and we're going to merge with the Middle East and merge with Africa.
[00:09:54.316 --> 00:09:57.198]  That's what the EU is doing now, outside of law.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.143]  Once that debate is forced out in the open, there's no reversing it.
[00:10:03.284 --> 00:10:05.465]  Oh, the Federal Reserve's not private, it's federal.
[00:10:05.785 --> 00:10:09.208]  Well, everybody now knows it really is private and it was a giant scam.
[00:10:09.688 --> 00:10:13.430]  In national polls, 95% in Gallup want it audited.
[00:10:14.351 --> 00:10:21.296]  We've gone from one person, 20 years ago in Congress, sponsoring the bill, to it passing the House and narrowly being blocked in the Senate.
[00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:25.129]  Oh, but they called us tinfoil hat people.
[00:10:25.289 --> 00:10:26.570]  Well, that gets a little old.
[00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.332]  Just like we told people 20 years ago.
[00:10:30.232 --> 00:10:38.157]  There was a plan to phase out the gas tax and give you a tax by the mile with a tracker box in your car.
[00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:42.379]  That's now being implemented in more than 16 states next year.
[00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:53.549]  Exactly as we said it would be, because we were reading the MIT reports, we were reading the big UN plans, we were reading the big consortium meeting documents on air.
[00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:58.878]  And now, on the West Coast, Oregon launching program to tax drivers by the mile.
[00:10:59.338 --> 00:11:00.819]  And I have the Washington Post here.
[00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:07.182]  East Coast states want to tax drivers travel, not their gas, and track everywhere you go and what you do.
[00:11:07.782 --> 00:11:09.483]  And of course, they've already done this in areas of Europe.
[00:11:09.603 --> 00:11:11.884]  On average, they double the cost of travel.
[00:11:12.324 --> 00:11:13.845]  Turning your car into a taxi.
[00:11:14.526 --> 00:11:16.046]  But, I digress.
[00:11:17.507 --> 00:11:21.769]  They want to keep us from ever having a debate about what's really going on.
[00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:22.710]  It's like the TPP.
[00:11:23.752 --> 00:11:27.755]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership's been negotiated for seven years in secret.
[00:11:28.736 --> 00:11:30.357]  Congress wasn't even allowed to read it.
[00:11:31.578 --> 00:11:36.822]  Infowars and Drudge and other Patriot sites like WorldNetDaily made a big deal about it the last few years.
[00:11:37.183 --> 00:11:44.368]  And so, in the last six months, Congress was allowed to go in and read one page at a time, but not tell anyone what was in it.
[00:11:45.109 --> 00:11:46.290]  How could Congress
[00:11:48.348 --> 00:11:54.274]  Even under pressure, be only allowed to look at it one page at a time, when it was over 12,000 pages long.
[00:11:57.337 --> 00:12:02.222]  Well, how does the EU appoint leaders in places like Greece and Italy?
[00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:04.163]  And now they want to do it in Spain.
[00:12:04.764 --> 00:12:09.368]  They want to do it... They appoint the leaders, and it's always a former head of Goldman Sachs!
[00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:10.610]  Isn't that funny?
[00:12:12.113 --> 00:12:15.256]  And Goldman Sachs is at the heart of funding a world government project.
[00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.217]  This is a Goldman Sachs-J.P.
[00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.659]  Morgan project more than anything else.
[00:12:19.379 --> 00:12:20.760]  It's planetary corporate rule.
[00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:32.711]  And they want to just keep us in the point of always debating with the New Yorker magazine and Raw Story and more than 50 other articles I saw in the last two days.
[00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:33.791]  Didn't even have time to read them all.
[00:12:33.992 --> 00:12:34.832]  Only read five or six.
[00:12:35.393 --> 00:12:36.574]  Attacking yours truly.
[00:12:38.177 --> 00:12:51.466]  Saying I'm insane and Donald Trump's insane when he says that the British exit vote is a blow to globalism, a blow to world government, a blow to unelected bureaucracy.
[00:12:51.886 --> 00:12:59.711]  And they quote us and make fun of it and then twist quotes in things I've said to make it look like I'm saying crazy things.
[00:13:03.012 --> 00:13:11.516]  But that doesn't work because even the Associated Press has the headline that the British exit empowers Trump as a sign of populism and a blow to global government.
[00:13:12.596 --> 00:13:14.497]  Even George Soros came out and said that.
[00:13:14.577 --> 00:13:15.197]  It's crazy!
[00:13:15.437 --> 00:13:22.460]  It's like if I say the sky is blue, play you video of it being blue, and they say, no, you're crazy, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:31.264]  This is a so-called intellectual elite arrogantly running a giant gaslighting operation, that's a CIA psychology term, where
[00:13:33.456 --> 00:13:38.218]  The most famous example is a film, based on a play, where this guy beats the daylights out of his wife.
[00:13:38.938 --> 00:13:41.480]  Breaks her nose, knocks her, you know, cheekbones in.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.121]  And when she's bleeding, he looks at her and says, you're insane, I didn't hit you.
[00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:52.965]  And even when she's got witnesses, he says he didn't do it, and acts super confident, and she's so overwhelmed, she thinks, okay, maybe she did it to herself.
[00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:56.706]  This is the highly suggestible, dumbed-down population.
[00:13:56.746 --> 00:14:02.789]  But even a dumbed-down, sleeping population, at a certain point, starts to wake up.
[00:14:04.206 --> 00:14:13.068]  So this is such an exciting time to be alive because mainstream media has a six percent trust rate now in Gallup polls and in AP polls.
[00:14:13.709 --> 00:14:14.829]  So what are they going to do?
[00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:26.152]  What are they going to do as they try to announce world government and global carbon taxes and taxing you by the mile and smart meters taxing you in your house and tracking everything you do and admitting they're doing it to you?
[00:14:26.212 --> 00:14:27.092]  And Zuckerberg!
[00:14:27.152 --> 00:14:27.713]  I forgot!
[00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:30.413]  Zuckerberg was in the New York Times.
[00:14:30.433 --> 00:14:31.094]  Guys, type it in.
[00:14:31.114 --> 00:14:32.234]  I meant to cover this Friday and didn't.
[00:14:33.323 --> 00:14:37.145]  Zuckerberg covers up his webcam camera and you should too.
[00:14:37.666 --> 00:14:44.970]  Oh my gosh, 21 years after I said cover up cameras that were starting to come in standard on some apples.
[00:14:47.071 --> 00:14:50.673]  I said it'll soon be ubiquitous and they're going to watch you with them and tax you with them.
[00:14:50.994 --> 00:14:54.596]  A few years after I warned of that because an NSA insider warned me and said they're already doing it.
[00:14:55.515 --> 00:15:07.721]  Google patented it and announced in 2003 that they were going to start watching and listening to you and sending it through third-party aggregators for corporate data mining.
[00:15:09.813 --> 00:15:12.396]  Oh, but do I get an award for telling you first?
[00:15:12.576 --> 00:15:13.096]  No, no, no.
[00:15:13.697 --> 00:15:24.047]  I'm the kook, but Zuckerberg covers his up and says you should too, and the FBI director came out two months ago and said you should cover up your webcam.
[00:15:24.067 --> 00:15:26.730]  Because it's not just corporations breaking in.
[00:15:29.162 --> 00:15:30.603]  But what about your smartphone?
[00:15:30.623 --> 00:15:34.226]  Can somebody bring me a, quote, smartphone, an Apple phone?
[00:15:34.247 --> 00:15:35.968]  Because I don't bring mine with me very often.
[00:15:36.388 --> 00:15:36.989]  I don't have mine.
[00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.933]  It's a limited weapons system I only use to upload videos as a shelf-based computer.
[00:15:42.133 --> 00:15:44.055]  But I know it's got globalist tech and tracking.
[00:15:45.796 --> 00:15:48.399]  No one's telling you, though, there's a built-in camera on this.
[00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:51.401]  And that by federal law, it's not allowed to be turned off.
[00:15:51.822 --> 00:15:55.445]  Even when your camera's off, even when your phone is physically turned off,
[00:15:56.818 --> 00:16:07.535]  Under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, all future computers and quote smartphones, they coined that term, have to be remotely accessed and appear like they're still off but still recording and tracking you.
[00:16:07.775 --> 00:16:08.256]  Federal law.
[00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:10.341]  Not a group.
[00:16:10.381 --> 00:16:11.783]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:16:11.803 --> 00:16:12.904]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:16:13.164 --> 00:16:14.085]  Why is this so good?
[00:16:14.385 --> 00:16:19.609]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:16:19.709 --> 00:16:33.260]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.702]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:16:35.462 --> 00:16:37.063]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:16:37.124 --> 00:16:39.606]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:16:39.706 --> 00:16:40.967]  These are all parasites.
[00:16:41.007 --> 00:16:42.088]  Tell us about all the stuff it says.
[00:16:42.108 --> 00:16:43.189]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:50.074]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, you have enzyme blend in there.
[00:16:50.114 --> 00:16:55.319]  This is very important because a lot of these microorganisms, and even going up to tapeworms, pinworms,
[00:16:55.859 --> 00:16:58.040]  You have to disintegrate the lining.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:03.062]  I mean, viruses protect themselves, and so do bacteria, protozoa, and mycoplasms.
[00:17:03.462 --> 00:17:07.684]  They have a protective shell that a lot of times the immune system can't even get into.
[00:17:07.884 --> 00:17:08.925]  Our own immune system.
[00:17:09.485 --> 00:17:12.186]  Especially since most people's immune system are weak anyway.
[00:17:12.346 --> 00:17:14.888]  People can avoid toxic air if they want.
[00:17:14.928 --> 00:17:16.570]  They can get an air purification system.
[00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:19.213]  They can avoid toxic water and drink clean water.
[00:17:19.633 --> 00:17:22.756]  But it's really hard to avoid parasites.
[00:17:23.236 --> 00:17:27.521]  It's hard to avoid attacking organisms and that's where I see this going.
[00:17:27.561 --> 00:17:29.563]  I mean, I think a lot of the information that we
[00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:30.443]  I think so.
[00:17:51.733 --> 00:17:53.354]  So the Living Defense is amazing.
[00:17:53.574 --> 00:17:55.854]  We've seen just tremendous reviews.
[00:17:56.515 --> 00:17:58.675]  How often should you take Living Defense?
[00:17:58.755 --> 00:18:00.076]  I mean, is it a regimen every day?
[00:18:00.116 --> 00:18:01.936]  That's what I was doing until we ran out.
[00:18:02.276 --> 00:18:03.997]  Or do you do it heavier for certain cleanses?
[00:18:04.017 --> 00:18:04.837]  What do you do, Dr. Group?
[00:18:05.537 --> 00:18:17.081]  Well, I do usually six weeks at a time because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites, it's six weeks from the time... So you've got to kill the ones that are in there and then kill their babies when the eggs hatch up.
[00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:31.995]  If you're suffering from abdominal pain, allergies, even like headaches, anemia, weakened immune system, gut problems, depression, hair loss, excess gas, muscle pain, nervousness, I mean all these things.
[00:18:32.055 --> 00:18:39.142]  If you look at some of these conditions and then us opening up our borders and all the other countries opening up their borders.
[00:18:39.682 --> 00:18:50.137]  You're just dealing with a mass amount of parasites or harmful organisms or biological weapons that are spreading and mutating all across the world.
[00:18:50.157 --> 00:18:54.303]  And I think that's one of the reasons why, I mean, all you have to do is look at the news these days.
[00:18:54.864 --> 00:18:57.285]  You can type in refugees spreading disease.
[00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:59.646]  I mean the CDC is going crazy right now.
[00:19:00.246 --> 00:19:04.668]  There's a new antibiotic resistant E. coli that they just identified.
[00:19:04.788 --> 00:19:05.869]  Doctors don't know.
[00:19:05.969 --> 00:19:09.610]  They don't teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms.
[00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.751]  There's a reason why they don't teach them about that.
[00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:16.513]  Just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause of disease and how to eliminate it.
[00:19:16.793 --> 00:19:17.814]  All disease out there.
[00:19:17.874 --> 00:19:19.255]  They don't want you to know about it.
[00:19:19.515 --> 00:19:22.218]  You don't want your own immune system being attacked.
[00:19:22.498 --> 00:19:25.880]  Again, you know, you have animals, especially your cats, dogs.
[00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:27.762]  So many people have pets these days.
[00:19:28.242 --> 00:19:29.664]  People eat raw sushi.
[00:19:30.064 --> 00:19:31.685]  People eat more raw food.
[00:19:31.725 --> 00:19:35.949]  You have all these different organisms showing up in the water supplies now.
[00:19:36.449 --> 00:19:39.772]  You even have it in the air supplies, these tiny microorganisms.
[00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:42.614]  So it's not like we can get away from them.
[00:19:42.694 --> 00:19:44.175]  We just have to do everything.
[00:19:44.255 --> 00:19:45.736]  I recommend doing a parasite
[00:19:46.637 --> 00:19:51.103]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:19:51.143 --> 00:19:52.144]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:19:52.204 --> 00:19:52.725]  Living Defense.
[00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:54.086]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:54.146 --> 00:19:55.168]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:19:55.188 --> 00:19:57.250]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:19:57.891 --> 00:19:59.753]  And you support the broadcast.
[00:19:59.813 --> 00:20:00.894]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:01.175 --> 00:20:03.057]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:20:03.437 --> 00:20:05.400]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:20:13.402 --> 00:20:19.585]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:38.394]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:41.189 --> 00:20:43.033]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:20:43.253 --> 00:20:43.674]  to 3 p.m.
[00:20:43.694 --> 00:20:43.975]  Central.
[00:20:43.995 --> 00:20:44.696]  We're here weekdays.
[00:20:44.777 --> 00:20:47.502]  I return live Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:20:47.563 --> 00:20:47.883]  Central.
[00:20:47.923 --> 00:20:48.845]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:20:49.935 --> 00:20:57.337]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to get back into the British exit, this death blow to the EU, which is a key world government project.
[00:20:57.377 --> 00:20:58.898]  This is such a huge victory.
[00:20:59.398 --> 00:21:02.419]  But I also want to break down how the globalists are going to strike back.
[00:21:02.819 --> 00:21:04.739]  I predicted this on Thursday and Friday.
[00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:07.400]  They are now doing exactly as I predicted.
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.241]  It's not hard to understand them, though.
[00:21:09.621 --> 00:21:11.901]  They've done this to countless other nations and regions.
[00:21:12.221 --> 00:21:13.782]  It's very, very formulaic.
[00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:17.143]  But speaking of that, the UN
[00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:34.358]  The program that we see taking place in Europe and the United States is funded and pushed by the big central banks that want to have cheap labor and want to basically play different nation states and populations off against each other.
[00:21:34.398 --> 00:21:35.559]  It's classic divide and conquer.
[00:21:35.739 --> 00:21:36.439]  That's no secret.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:44.142]  But if you look at the UN Migrant Borders Council,
[00:21:45.416 --> 00:22:11.887]  And the holiday they've created, World Refugee Day, that they just celebrated last week, this is where the globalists weaponize third world populations from the Middle East and bring them into Europe, from Latin America and Asia, and bring them into the United States, and then organize them into internal political groups, which are then given welfare at levels even higher than U.S.
[00:22:12.027 --> 00:22:13.928]  Social Security recipients.
[00:22:15.494 --> 00:22:21.517]  17,000 plus dollars a year in basic benefits to leverage out the domestic population.
[00:22:22.317 --> 00:22:29.581]  This is classical tyranny, classical subterfuge, over-the-top treason.
[00:22:31.201 --> 00:22:34.343]  Now we've been pointing out that the last three years
[00:22:35.569 --> 00:22:52.562]  Obama went from very lax enforcement of illegals, including illegals that have felony backgrounds and convictions, aggravated felons, rapists, arsonists, bank robbers, you name it, and went to total catch and release about four years ago, and he didn't get in trouble for that.
[00:22:53.042 --> 00:22:56.044]  So then Obama went to the mother of all tyrannies.
[00:22:57.325 --> 00:23:00.348]  The illegals get into the US on trains and on buses.
[00:23:01.434 --> 00:23:07.039]  Mexico lets them in from South America and Central America, but doesn't let them stay there.
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:14.865]  And once they get into the country, buses are waiting at every major town and city, from California to Texas.
[00:23:15.626 --> 00:23:18.809]  And all in between, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, you name it.
[00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:28.096]  And they bus them to Democratic Party facilities, to public schools, to Catholic churches, where they are then put on welfare.
[00:23:29.051 --> 00:23:33.535]  And given stipends, and then part of that money is donated back to the Democrats.
[00:23:34.055 --> 00:23:35.236]  You cannot make this up.
[00:23:35.296 --> 00:23:38.099]  Now, we broke this two years ago.
[00:23:38.439 --> 00:23:39.540]  The Border Patrol called us.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.661]  ICE called us.
[00:23:41.121 --> 00:23:44.024]  We said, wow, thank you for giving this inside info.
[00:23:44.044 --> 00:23:47.126]  And they said, listen, Mr. Jones, we gave this to Fox News.
[00:23:47.487 --> 00:23:49.228]  We gave this to the New York Times before you.
[00:23:49.688 --> 00:23:50.669]  None of them will report.
[00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:55.874]  We drove down, Adon Salazar, Jacari Jackson, Kit Daniels, Joe Biggs, and met.
[00:23:56.914 --> 00:24:02.356]  And did the interviews, with the Border Patrol agents' faces blurred out and their voices scrambled.
[00:24:03.057 --> 00:24:11.941]  And then we went to where they said go, and there were dozens of buses, four times a day, pulling up in McAllen, Texas.
[00:24:11.981 --> 00:24:12.741]  It's a small town.
[00:24:14.522 --> 00:24:25.727]  And the emergency manager told us, yo, yo, we bring them in, the Border Patrol gives them vouchers of money, we put them on Greyhound buses and send them to wherever they want to go.
[00:24:27.788 --> 00:24:34.931]  No one covered this, but Fox a little bit, because the Border Patrol union head was on and said, we complete the smuggling process.
[00:24:35.291 --> 00:24:37.232]  We've warned people, no one will tell the public.
[00:24:37.492 --> 00:24:39.292]  We get threatened with our jobs if we tell you.
[00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:43.214]  So Jakari Jackson went down and got the report.
[00:24:43.994 --> 00:24:49.896]  Now, all these years later, two years later, this was two Junes ago, here is KRGV.
[00:24:49.956 --> 00:24:51.097]  This is so amazing.
[00:24:51.617 --> 00:24:56.779]  I'm not going to play the whole report here, you can see it at InfoWars.com, but they report on it like it's no big deal.
[00:24:58.069 --> 00:24:59.410]  They're, oh, the U.N.
[00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.552]  More Central Americans headed to the U.S.
[00:25:02.352 --> 00:25:03.913]  That's what Obama admitted last week.
[00:25:04.314 --> 00:25:10.078]  The State Department has videos that we played here admitting that they get their orders from the U.N.
[00:25:10.098 --> 00:25:14.481]  Remember when Obama said, I'm allowed to go into Syria, I'm allowed to go into Libya because I have U.N.
[00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:17.003]  authorization and I have NATO authorization?
[00:25:17.324 --> 00:25:23.268]  And generals and others went before Congress and Congress senators said, you get your authority from Congress, from us.
[00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:25.590]  They go, no, we get it from NATO and the U.N.
[00:25:27.742 --> 00:25:29.944]  Just like Merkel says she gets it from the UN.
[00:25:29.964 --> 00:25:32.526]  They're like, it's illegal for you to bring these people in here unvetted.
[00:25:32.546 --> 00:25:33.787]  She goes, well, I have the UN.
[00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:34.708]  I have the EU.
[00:25:35.708 --> 00:25:36.329]  I have NATO.
[00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.391]  We're already in this global government.
[00:25:38.591 --> 00:25:48.519]  So they have KRGV-TV in McAllen, Texas, and they report like it's, oh, just helping the locals, helping the citizens, helping everyone.
[00:25:49.875 --> 00:25:50.495]  You'd never know.
[00:25:50.535 --> 00:25:55.738]  They say, oh, they're immigrants, yeah, they came here illegally, but we're just helping them, and we're loving, and we get them on the buses.
[00:25:56.018 --> 00:25:58.560]  No discussion of where they go, what they do.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.461]  It's just, oh, the UN gives the order.
[00:26:00.661 --> 00:26:02.422]  See, they don't announce it like Red Dawn.
[00:26:02.602 --> 00:26:05.303]  The UN is invading, we're under UN control, martial law.
[00:26:05.544 --> 00:26:16.990]  It's just, Germany and these other countries are under a civil emergency, and Greece gets its presidents appointed now, and so does Italy, and yeah, we're gonna bring in five million people from jihad nations, and if you criticize it, we're gonna arrest you.
[00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.191]  Yeah, there's no more free speech.
[00:26:18.551 --> 00:26:18.671]  Yeah.
[00:26:19.588 --> 00:26:30.918]  See, that's just, oh, the UN says get ready for record numbers, because they're running the program at the refugee centers, making a deal with Mexico to allow them in, but they don't get to stay in Mexico, they come here.
[00:26:31.198 --> 00:26:32.640]  And Mexico came out last week and said...
[00:26:33.746 --> 00:26:34.707]  We're about to go bankrupt.
[00:26:34.747 --> 00:26:35.607]  We gotta stop this.
[00:26:35.887 --> 00:26:37.528]  We got too many Latin Americans pouring in.
[00:26:37.988 --> 00:26:38.949]  Our border's collapsing.
[00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:41.170]  Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:26:41.451 --> 00:26:45.433]  You're getting paid billions by the globalists to allow this to happen through U.S.
[00:26:45.453 --> 00:26:46.033]  taxpayer money.
[00:26:46.393 --> 00:26:49.956]  Mexico is paid $5 billion a year to allow this to happen.
[00:26:50.096 --> 00:26:50.536]  Look that up.
[00:26:52.517 --> 00:26:59.439]  Now, now, now, how do I communicate with the average dumbed-down American who just sees a newscast that's like, oh, we're helping people the U.N.
[00:26:59.499 --> 00:27:00.179]  said to.
[00:27:00.199 --> 00:27:01.700]  Oh, the U.N.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.021]  suing Sheriff Arpaio because he arrests illegals.
[00:27:05.201 --> 00:27:07.941]  How evil he arrests illegals that commit crimes.
[00:27:08.281 --> 00:27:09.362]  How horrible.
[00:27:10.442 --> 00:27:13.804]  So, we're going to go to breaking the moment, but first I want to play part of Jakari Jackson's report.
[00:27:14.524 --> 00:27:19.186]  Two years ago, here's the article, up on Infowars.com, we've reposted it.
[00:27:19.527 --> 00:27:23.989]  Flashback, Obama admin busing illegals deep in the U.S.
[00:27:24.069 --> 00:27:27.791]  In 2014, Infowars broke how Obama admin was bringing in illegals via bus.
[00:27:28.905 --> 00:27:32.347]  And to see how controlled it is, no one picked it up.
[00:27:32.968 --> 00:27:40.073]  Six months later, the New York Times in one little blurb admitted, they come in and then Obama has them shipped to other areas and released.
[00:27:41.223 --> 00:27:41.763]  Here's another one.
[00:27:41.963 --> 00:27:42.804]  Here's the original article.
[00:27:42.844 --> 00:27:43.444]  June 18, 2014.
[00:27:44.724 --> 00:27:45.484]  Caught red-handed.
[00:27:45.764 --> 00:27:52.247]  Border Patrol paying to ship illegals deep into the United States.
[00:27:53.067 --> 00:27:53.587]  Exclusive.
[00:27:53.627 --> 00:27:55.548]  Federal government works to keep illegals inside the U.S.
[00:27:55.768 --> 00:27:57.968]  while passing the cost on the American taxpayers.
[00:27:58.229 --> 00:27:59.949]  And now the TB is pouring in.
[00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.889]  The diseases.
[00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.890]  We've got to pay for that.
[00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:08.372]  But let's go out to break with a clip of Jokari talking to the emergency manager head who's admitting it all.
[00:28:09.175 --> 00:28:18.181]  Well what happened today in particular is that the Border Patrol dropped off some, they call them detainees, but obviously they're not detained after they drop them off.
[00:28:18.702 --> 00:28:23.405]  And normally they have tickets or arranged transportation to go somewhere in the interior.
[00:28:23.966 --> 00:28:31.671]  Well today, apparently for some logistical reasons, some of them hadn't had transportation arranged or their transportation is tomorrow.
[00:28:31.931 --> 00:28:32.131]  Right.
[00:28:32.572 --> 00:28:35.354]  And so we're having to find places to shelter them.
[00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:36.594]  For tonight.
[00:28:36.694 --> 00:28:39.336]  So we've accessed some resources that we have.
[00:28:39.356 --> 00:28:40.736]  We're going to shelter them here tonight.
[00:28:41.116 --> 00:28:43.037]  So why is the Border Patrol bringing them here?
[00:28:43.858 --> 00:28:44.798]  They're not bringing them here.
[00:28:44.818 --> 00:28:50.681]  They're bringing them to our bus terminal because that's where the Border Patrol understands that they have transportation.
[00:28:51.201 --> 00:28:52.142]  All right, let's stop right there.
[00:28:52.202 --> 00:28:56.768]  They give them vouchers, watch the whole report, and then the city gets to pay for it all, the taxpayers.
[00:28:56.808 --> 00:28:58.570]  Because after all, that's our job, right?
[00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:59.712]  We pay for everything, for everybody.
[00:29:00.132 --> 00:29:01.514]  We're evil and racist if we don't.
[00:29:01.935 --> 00:29:02.856]  They'll be back on the other side.
[00:29:02.876 --> 00:29:03.457]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:03.477 --> 00:29:05.319]  See the full video at InfoWars.com.
[00:29:09.426 --> 00:29:12.367]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:29:12.667 --> 00:29:22.249]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:09.559]  I do not agree.
[00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:11.001]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:30:11.041 --> 00:30:12.122]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:30:12.382 --> 00:30:13.303]  Why is this so good?
[00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:18.827]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:30:18.907 --> 00:30:32.458]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:30:32.518 --> 00:30:33.900]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.241]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:30:36.321 --> 00:30:38.803]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:30:38.903 --> 00:30:40.164]  These are all parasites.
[00:30:40.224 --> 00:30:41.304]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:30:41.324 --> 00:30:42.365]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:30:42.677 --> 00:30:49.222]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, you have enzyme blend in there.
[00:30:49.242 --> 00:30:57.248]  And this is very important because a lot of these microorganisms, and even going up to tapeworms, pinworms, you have to disintegrate the lining.
[00:30:57.268 --> 00:31:02.292]  I mean, viruses protect themselves, and so do bacteria, protozoa, and mycoplasms.
[00:31:02.672 --> 00:31:06.915]  They have a protective shell that a lot of times the immune system can't even get into.
[00:31:07.095 --> 00:31:08.156]  Our own immune system.
[00:31:08.717 --> 00:31:11.419]  Especially since most people's immune system are weak anyway.
[00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:23.047]  So we actually designed the Living Defense and put in a specific blend of enzymes which actually chew and eat through the lining of these different organisms.
[00:31:23.628 --> 00:31:25.249]  So the Living Defense is amazing.
[00:31:25.489 --> 00:31:27.731]  We've seen just tremendous reviews.
[00:31:28.411 --> 00:31:30.573]  How often should you take Living Defense?
[00:31:30.593 --> 00:31:31.974]  I mean, is it a regimen every day?
[00:31:32.014 --> 00:31:33.855]  That's what I was doing until we ran out.
[00:31:34.176 --> 00:31:35.897]  Or do you do it heavier for certain cleanses?
[00:31:35.917 --> 00:31:36.738]  What do you do, Dr. Group?
[00:31:37.418 --> 00:31:49.043]  Well, I do usually six weeks at a time because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites, it's six weeks from the time... So you gotta kill the ones that are in there and then kill their babies when the eggs hatch up.
[00:31:49.303 --> 00:31:59.187]  If you're suffering from abdominal pain, allergies, even like headaches, anemia, weakened immune system, gut problems, depression, hair loss,
[00:32:00.267 --> 00:32:02.768]  Excess gas, muscle pain, nervousness.
[00:32:02.808 --> 00:32:03.868]  I mean, all these things.
[00:32:04.128 --> 00:32:05.248]  Doctors don't know.
[00:32:05.308 --> 00:32:08.949]  They don't teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms.
[00:32:08.969 --> 00:32:11.109]  There's a reason why they don't teach them about that.
[00:32:11.189 --> 00:32:17.150]  Just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause of disease and how to eliminate all disease out there.
[00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:18.610]  They don't want you to know about it.
[00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:21.571]  You don't want your own immune system being attacked.
[00:32:21.831 --> 00:32:25.231]  Again, you know, you have animals, especially your cats, dogs.
[00:32:25.271 --> 00:32:27.112]  So many people have pets these days.
[00:32:27.592 --> 00:32:28.912]  People eat raw sushi.
[00:32:29.392 --> 00:32:30.994]  People eat more raw food.
[00:32:31.054 --> 00:32:35.278]  You have all these different organisms showing up in the water supplies now.
[00:32:35.758 --> 00:32:39.102]  You even have it in the air supplies, these tiny microorganisms.
[00:32:39.142 --> 00:32:41.984]  So it's not like we can get away from them.
[00:32:42.044 --> 00:32:43.506]  We just have to do everything.
[00:32:43.586 --> 00:32:45.067]  I recommend doing a parasite
[00:32:45.988 --> 00:32:50.470]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:51.491]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:32:51.551 --> 00:32:52.071]  Living Defense.
[00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:53.412]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:53.472 --> 00:32:54.492]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:32:54.512 --> 00:32:56.593]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:32:57.233 --> 00:32:59.094]  And you support the broadcast.
[00:32:59.154 --> 00:33:00.235]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:00.515 --> 00:33:02.416]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:33:02.776 --> 00:33:04.737]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:33:13.951 --> 00:33:26.553]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.653 --> 00:33:33.374]  And it's time for you men to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you wanna fight?
[00:33:33.474 --> 00:33:35.755]  You better believe you got one!
[00:33:37.875 --> 00:33:42.956]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:46.866 --> 00:34:00.991]  Now, coming up, I'm going to play the leader of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, in their victory speech on Friday, after the UK voted to leave the European Union.
[00:34:02.131 --> 00:34:15.516]  And understand, this is on record, the UK never voted to enter it, A. B, even ten years ago, if you talked about the EU having governmental powers, they called you a conspiracy theorist.
[00:34:17.423 --> 00:34:26.305]  I remember being on air 20 years ago talking about the EU on air, and they would have articles saying it didn't exist, and conspiracy theorists were talking about it.
[00:34:26.765 --> 00:34:29.246]  This is the magnitude of the hoaxing!
[00:34:30.786 --> 00:34:34.887]  Just like the Federal Reserve is federal, and don't believe the conspiracy theorists.
[00:34:34.947 --> 00:34:41.989]  When its charter is public, it is a private consortium of private banks, it has private shareholders, now everyone knows that!
[00:34:43.735 --> 00:34:45.296]  That's admitted, even by the Federal Reserve.
[00:34:45.556 --> 00:34:47.436]  Once they couldn't cover it up, they went, of course we're independent.
[00:34:47.677 --> 00:34:48.437]  That means we're private.
[00:34:48.497 --> 00:34:53.059]  You can't... I mean, I can play Alan Greenspan for you saying it on Laird NewsHour if you want.
[00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:54.199]  Ten years ago.
[00:34:54.619 --> 00:34:55.039]  Want me to?
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:02.002]  Think of all the thousands of articles and headlines that, you know, the Federal Reserve is federal.
[00:35:02.903 --> 00:35:09.165]  Yeah, and so is, you know, Federal Credit Union, and so is Federal Ammunition, and so is Federal Air Conditioning.
[00:35:09.525 --> 00:35:11.506]  Bull, bull, bull.
[00:35:14.957 --> 00:35:15.917]  There's the headline, yeah.
[00:35:15.957 --> 00:35:18.818]  The Federal Reserve mentions 12 banks are private, not government entities.
[00:35:19.658 --> 00:35:20.958]  That's in response to lawsuits.
[00:35:22.478 --> 00:35:23.678]  Alright, let's just stop right there.
[00:35:23.698 --> 00:35:24.459]  That's from 2011.
[00:35:26.199 --> 00:35:36.301]  But imagine, we go down and show buses lined up, just like 12 of them at a time or more, loaded four times a day with illegals from all over the world.
[00:35:36.781 --> 00:35:38.301]  And the media's like, they're just children.
[00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:39.561]  We're just helping children.
[00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:41.902]  Then it came out 17% were children.
[00:35:42.462 --> 00:35:43.162]  Had nothing to do with it.
[00:35:43.182 --> 00:35:43.982]  It was their whole families.
[00:35:44.002 --> 00:35:44.262]  They're like,
[00:35:44.943 --> 00:35:45.544]  That's okay.
[00:35:45.924 --> 00:35:46.704]  Why do you hate children?
[00:35:46.805 --> 00:35:47.685]  Everything's a lie!
[00:35:47.765 --> 00:35:48.666]  Everything's a gimmick!
[00:35:48.706 --> 00:35:50.608]  Everything's a... Well, he's just helping children!
[00:35:51.548 --> 00:35:51.849]  No!
[00:35:52.289 --> 00:35:56.873]  Outside of law, Obama just started saying, come here!
[00:35:56.933 --> 00:35:57.473]  It's free!
[00:35:57.533 --> 00:35:57.933]  It's open!
[00:35:58.214 --> 00:36:10.844]  Just like Von Ruppe, the head of the EU, did six years ago, and Merkel, and Hollande, all the leaders of these countries, transferring their power to the EU, said to a bunch of Muslim radical nations, come in!
[00:36:11.284 --> 00:36:11.705]  Come in!
[00:36:11.765 --> 00:36:12.425]  Everything's free!
[00:36:12.625 --> 00:36:13.286]  And they showed up!
[00:36:13.366 --> 00:36:14.026]  Five million of them!
[00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.351]  They just called them Syrian refugees.
[00:36:17.051 --> 00:36:18.392]  The vast majority aren't from Syria.
[00:36:18.592 --> 00:36:19.852]  They're invaders of Syria.
[00:36:20.052 --> 00:36:21.153]  And that's all come out too!
[00:36:22.974 --> 00:36:30.277]  So... Here is how they propagandize this when they announce the UN's running this and the UN controls this.
[00:36:30.577 --> 00:36:31.738]  Oh, it's just charity.
[00:36:32.058 --> 00:36:32.958]  Oh, they're just here.
[00:36:33.559 --> 00:36:40.402]  And then... We just put them on the buses and they just go somewhere.
[00:36:41.792 --> 00:36:50.517]  We don't test them for TB or the bubonic plague or all these hundreds of different ailments and parasites, which they admit in the news.
[00:36:50.557 --> 00:36:51.457]  I've got the stacks here.
[00:36:52.398 --> 00:36:55.159]  22% of refugees have TB, drug-resistant.
[00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:55.879]  Here it is.
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.041]  TB cases exploding across the country.
[00:36:59.481 --> 00:37:01.222]  Six new diseases that weren't even in the U.S.
[00:37:01.262 --> 00:37:01.762]  are now here.
[00:37:02.023 --> 00:37:04.484]  They just take the kids, put them in school next to your kids!
[00:37:06.508 --> 00:37:13.093]  Anderson High, where I went to school, has 200 plus Syrian refugees, and no testing was done.
[00:37:13.193 --> 00:37:15.314]  That's one school in Austin.
[00:37:17.276 --> 00:37:18.116]  We called a bunch of schools.
[00:37:18.176 --> 00:37:19.937]  It's thousands in the high schools alone.
[00:37:20.198 --> 00:37:21.859]  My God, who knows the numbers of the adults?
[00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:24.841]  And they tell us not even a thousand have come into Texas in the last year.
[00:37:25.101 --> 00:37:27.843]  I can call three or four high schools, it's over a thousand.
[00:37:29.042 --> 00:37:34.869]  We have no idea how many are being brought in from Mexico, China, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia.
[00:37:35.029 --> 00:37:37.232]  Saudi Arabia won't take one of these people.
[00:37:40.865 --> 00:37:42.746]  This is a joke to bankrupt the country.
[00:37:42.806 --> 00:37:44.387]  This is war against the nation.
[00:37:44.687 --> 00:37:50.910]  But by the time it hits KRGV television, it's, he's a firefighter and a patriot.
[00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:52.071]  He's here helping good people.
[00:37:52.091 --> 00:37:54.192]  It's like, well, I just feel good helping people.
[00:37:54.352 --> 00:37:56.073]  Because they tell him, hey, they're refugees.
[00:37:56.333 --> 00:37:57.274]  Hey, we're helping them.
[00:37:57.294 --> 00:37:59.815]  Hey, they get here, we just ship them somewhere.
[00:38:00.996 --> 00:38:04.197]  But when you come across the border, on come the gloves.
[00:38:05.598 --> 00:38:06.959]  That's ABC News.
[00:38:08.018 --> 00:38:08.938]  Reporting it.
[00:38:09.058 --> 00:38:11.579]  Let's play a short clip of this, and then I want to get to Nigel Farage.
[00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:11.979]  Here it is.
[00:38:13.859 --> 00:38:21.601]  Happening right now, the United Nations says there are more Central Americans headed to the valley where they crossed the border illegally.
[00:38:22.961 --> 00:38:34.604]  Now let's back up, because we did a report this week where we played the State Department UN Refugee Liaison at the UN saying, we get the authority to bring these people in because the UN, they run the program, just like in Europe.
[00:38:36.308 --> 00:38:37.268]  So see, the U.N.'
[00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:38.488]  's running this.
[00:38:38.968 --> 00:38:40.089]  Oh, the U.N.'
[00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:43.589]  's suing over a sheriff arresting an illegal for drunk driving.
[00:38:43.909 --> 00:38:44.550]  Oh, the U.N.'
[00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.490]  's setting up strong cities to tell our police departments how to operate.
[00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:49.290]  I mean, this is all really going on.
[00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:54.671]  Loretta Lynch, remember three months ago, met with the U.N.
[00:38:54.691 --> 00:38:57.712]  and announced billions in federal funding to set up U.N.
[00:38:57.752 --> 00:39:00.793]  offices in every major city to watch our police.
[00:39:01.153 --> 00:39:03.013]  Because we've got strong cities.
[00:39:04.229 --> 00:39:08.251]  You think having some communist community organizer, Obama, running around stirring stuff up is bad?
[00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:24.618]  Wait till the UN's involved, and now it is, with their refugee program that the founder of the EU, the founder, the founder, has now moved down from the top position to be the head of the refugee program.
[00:39:25.518 --> 00:39:27.859]  Oh, Peter Sutherland.
[00:39:28.079 --> 00:39:28.900]  Let's finish the report.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.240]  Here it is.
[00:39:30.373 --> 00:39:37.277]  What's happening right now, the United Nations says there are more Central Americans headed to the valley where they crossed the border illegally.
[00:39:37.417 --> 00:39:45.701]  The Channel 5's Kristen Von Pricing joins us with more on conditions forcing them to flee and what humanitarian workers... Back it up 10 seconds, please.
[00:39:46.261 --> 00:39:57.367]  The UN that forced them to, the communism, the socialism, the UN corrupt programs that run most these countries, the IMF World Bank collapsing them, creating the Arab Spring, on record the West funded that.
[00:39:58.154 --> 00:40:00.997]  Putting jihadis in control of countries that are our allies and stable.
[00:40:01.197 --> 00:40:03.360]  Where Christians and Jews and Muslims lived in peace together.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.302]  From Egypt to Libya to Syria.
[00:40:05.582 --> 00:40:09.266]  Bringing them all here and then, oh, they're going to save us from the problem.
[00:40:09.466 --> 00:40:11.228]  The exact same program they're running in Europe.
[00:40:12.014 --> 00:40:14.455]  My gut tells me it's probably a million Muslim refugees.
[00:40:14.595 --> 00:40:16.076]  I really look at the numbers of all the cities.
[00:40:16.476 --> 00:40:20.238]  If my high school got 230 plus, and I called other high schools, they were getting 150, 270.
[00:40:20.658 --> 00:40:25.620]  Every high school, and then I called elementaries, they're getting them, but wouldn't say the numbers.
[00:40:25.881 --> 00:40:28.702]  It's on their websites at Anderson High, because they're begging for help!
[00:40:30.399 --> 00:40:31.680]  Who knows the true numbers?
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.101]  They're here illegally, they're from the U.U., but the U.N.
[00:40:35.141 --> 00:40:37.882]  says it's okay, because they're fleeing something.
[00:40:38.282 --> 00:40:39.203]  They're fleeing the U.N.
[00:40:39.243 --> 00:40:39.583]  Here it is.
[00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:42.904]  Americans headed to the valley where they crossed the border illegally.
[00:40:42.984 --> 00:40:51.628]  The gentlifies Christian von Pricing joins us with more on conditions forcing them to flee and what humanitarian workers are seeing here at home.
[00:40:54.229 --> 00:40:55.370]  The McAllen bus station.
[00:40:56.445 --> 00:40:58.947]  Luis Guerrero started volunteering here two years ago.
[00:40:59.408 --> 00:41:02.130]  I'm an ex-firefighter, you know, I always like to help people.
[00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:03.391]  The people he helps.
[00:41:03.751 --> 00:41:06.214]  They have advertised, come here and everything's free.
[00:41:06.534 --> 00:41:08.856]  Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador.
[00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:11.430]  Families and kids.
[00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:13.991]  Young people Guerrero tries to inspire.
[00:41:14.011 --> 00:41:16.332]  Oh, it's inspiring.
[00:41:17.672 --> 00:41:18.792]  Oh my gosh.
[00:41:19.032 --> 00:41:20.173]  Oh, just come on in.
[00:41:20.213 --> 00:41:21.013]  Everything's free.
[00:41:21.053 --> 00:41:22.513]  These people can't believe it.
[00:41:22.533 --> 00:41:23.614]  They're like, what?
[00:41:23.654 --> 00:41:26.835]  Central American families are caught and released by border patrol.
[00:41:27.175 --> 00:41:28.055]  They end up here.
[00:41:28.655 --> 00:41:30.155]  Lately, Guerrero has seen a change.
[00:41:32.216 --> 00:41:34.077]  Notice how they just said that bombshell news.
[00:41:34.618 --> 00:41:36.379]  They're caught and released by the Border Patrol.
[00:41:36.879 --> 00:41:37.920]  They end up here.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.621]  The Border Patrol is ordered.
[00:41:39.902 --> 00:41:40.842]  They come in on trains.
[00:41:40.862 --> 00:41:41.963]  They're not coming across the water.
[00:41:42.243 --> 00:41:44.745]  Local Mexicans bringing drugs and are going back and forth in rafts.
[00:41:45.205 --> 00:41:45.906]  We videotaped it.
[00:41:45.946 --> 00:41:47.027]  That's what the rafts are.
[00:41:47.227 --> 00:41:48.007]  And then the packages.
[00:41:48.027 --> 00:41:49.828]  That's cocaine, marijuana, and heroin.
[00:41:49.869 --> 00:41:50.169]  Okay?
[00:41:50.749 --> 00:41:52.330]  They show that to deceive you in the report.
[00:41:52.751 --> 00:41:53.011]  Okay?
[00:41:54.772 --> 00:41:55.392]  It's on the news.
[00:41:55.432 --> 00:41:56.673]  They got big trains coming.
[00:41:56.693 --> 00:41:59.655]  You're not allowed to get off the trains or the Mexicans arrest you and torture you.
[00:41:59.675 --> 00:42:00.456]  That's the Leningradian.
[00:42:01.096 --> 00:42:01.597]  Or kill you.
[00:42:02.622 --> 00:42:03.503]  They don't take illegals.
[00:42:03.523 --> 00:42:04.463]  They don't pay for stuff for free.
[00:42:04.643 --> 00:42:06.885]  They say, you come in, you go up, the U.S.
[00:42:06.925 --> 00:42:11.048]  pays us to do this, the globalists, and you get off, you are going to a forced labor camp.
[00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:12.609]  They bring them in.
[00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:14.210]  They load them in.
[00:42:15.011 --> 00:42:15.892]  They know what they're doing.
[00:42:17.052 --> 00:42:20.034]  And then they go, oh, they wind up here.
[00:42:20.675 --> 00:42:31.583]  Yeah, where we first broke it for the Border Patrol, the Border Patrol is ordered to take them, not test them, not check them, and give them up to $1,000 apiece in vouchers to travel anywhere they want in the United States.
[00:42:32.836 --> 00:42:43.143]  And money for food, everything, and then their bust to Democratic Party operations, who then house them under your city funding, your county funding, your school funding, as we just showed the emergency manager admitting.
[00:42:43.504 --> 00:42:44.704]  Now that's it for that report.
[00:42:45.045 --> 00:42:46.966]  I'm gonna come back and talk about the EU.
[00:42:47.146 --> 00:42:48.767]  Unelected, but ruling Europe.
[00:42:49.808 --> 00:42:50.869]  The EU bureaucrats
[00:42:53.433 --> 00:42:54.274]  Are tax exempt.
[00:42:54.394 --> 00:42:55.215]  Did I add that part?
[00:42:55.275 --> 00:43:02.162]  I mean, you couldn't make it up, but they hope you're so dumb and so uninformed they can rummage on you and just call us conspiracy theorists.
[00:43:02.623 --> 00:43:04.445]  Doesn't work anymore, suckers!
[00:43:05.165 --> 00:43:07.308]  Conspiracy theorists is a badge of honor.
[00:43:09.997 --> 00:43:14.024]  Hillary Clinton is posing as an advocate for domestic abuse victims.
[00:43:14.505 --> 00:43:17.470]  But behind closed doors, she's a violent abuser.
[00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:20.134]  Find out what Hillary has done to Bill.
[00:43:20.535 --> 00:43:22.077]  The Clinton's War on Women.

[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.003]  Brexit victory makes Trump presidency more likely.
[00:43:30.103 --> 00:43:37.771]  Article up by Paul Joseph Watson, Brits stunned the world yesterday by choosing to ditch the European Union and reclaim their own sovereignty.
[00:43:37.911 --> 00:43:41.214]  A result that has rocked the entire global order.
[00:43:41.475 --> 00:43:46.640]  It's also an outcome that could help blaze a trail for Trump all the way to the Oval Office.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.242]  There's one conclusion to draw from the Brexit result.
[00:43:49.362 --> 00:43:59.668]  It's that nationalist sentiments may not necessarily be visible to political elites, but the right person, with the right cause, can easily bring them out, writes Brett Logiardo.
[00:43:59.788 --> 00:44:01.910]  According to Republican pollster Frank Luntz,
[00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:05.033]  The result represents a massive populist uprising.
[00:44:05.153 --> 00:44:10.339]  Populism is rising everywhere as people decide that government does not listen and does not care.
[00:44:10.659 --> 00:44:16.045]  But this is even more significant because Britain has never been the source of populist uprisings like this.
[00:44:16.245 --> 00:44:20.730]  If Britain can vote itself out of Europe, America can vote itself in for Trump.
[00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:24.013]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:44:24.614 --> 00:44:30.421]  Hillary Clinton has an unusually close relationship with top female aide, Huma Abedin.
[00:44:31.041 --> 00:44:33.745]  But does Huma have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood?
[00:44:34.606 --> 00:44:38.950]  Find out in The Clinton's War on Women, in stores now.
[00:44:40.942 --> 00:44:44.344]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:44:44.705 --> 00:44:51.829]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:44:52.450 --> 00:45:00.815]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:45:01.076 --> 00:45:05.218]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:45:05.478 --> 00:45:10.742]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:45:11.062 --> 00:45:14.885]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:45:15.306 --> 00:45:18.428]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:45:18.708 --> 00:45:29.797]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:59.413]  Brexit victory makes Trump presidency more likely.

[00:47:13.883 --> 00:47:18.384]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.585 --> 00:47:30.346]  Fear is the passion of slaves, and this man knows no fear.
[00:47:32.107 --> 00:47:34.127]  He is Alex Jones.
[00:47:35.228 --> 00:47:42.069]  Well, like I said, you can tell I didn't write that line, or the ones I've, I've written 98% of them, that one makes it sound like I'm God Almighty or something, and I do know fear.
[00:47:43.348 --> 00:47:47.470]  I know fear of letting these people win and being a slave.
[00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:52.272]  Folks think I'm fearless because I get in their face and don't care if they come after me.
[00:47:52.472 --> 00:47:55.093]  That's because as a man I've got to defend my family and my country.
[00:47:55.273 --> 00:47:57.774]  So I don't know fear of repercussions.
[00:47:58.235 --> 00:48:00.155]  But I know intense fear of them winning.
[00:48:00.456 --> 00:48:01.316]  Intense fear!
[00:48:01.736 --> 00:48:02.476]  Total fear!
[00:48:02.496 --> 00:48:07.719]  So I desperately resist them because they're a pack of lying scum
[00:48:09.144 --> 00:48:11.346]  You know, Jay-Z loves to con his audience.
[00:48:11.366 --> 00:48:16.629]  He jokes about how dumb they are, like Mark Zuckerberg calls his users dumb-effers for trusting him.
[00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:28.117]  And you know, Samsung puts, when you buy a smart TV, but all of them do this, I'm not sealing them out, that, yeah, we sell your data, we watch you live time in your house with real people and computer AI and audio, we sell it to the government.
[00:48:28.838 --> 00:48:30.959]  This is an NSA interface you just bought.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:32.881]  I mean, that's all public.
[00:48:34.462 --> 00:48:37.664]  Zuckerberg came out, you know, and said, yeah, I cover up my computer, you know, video camera.
[00:48:38.607 --> 00:48:42.029]  Oh my gosh, he's so trendy, 20 years after I told you they were doing it.
[00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:47.232]  They know they've lost, they know you're aware of it, so now they want to act like they're with us.
[00:48:50.134 --> 00:48:52.615]  But I only know the fear of these tyrants winning.
[00:48:53.996 --> 00:48:57.438]  And actually dominating humanity and species death.
[00:48:58.259 --> 00:49:02.141]  Because I have the race consciousness of humanity like everybody else does, but mine is very active.
[00:49:03.835 --> 00:49:05.017]  And I'm very upset.
[00:49:05.037 --> 00:49:06.919]  I'm not worried about my own personal death.
[00:49:06.959 --> 00:49:12.627]  I'm worried about the death of my children, their cultural death, your children's cultural death, our future.
[00:49:12.827 --> 00:49:14.810]  Because everybody was betting on us before.
[00:49:15.231 --> 00:49:16.813]  I'm betting on everybody else going forward.
[00:49:17.334 --> 00:49:19.937]  Sure, eternal life is genetic.
[00:49:20.638 --> 00:49:29.702]  And the globalists know that and are destroying our genetics and merging us with machines and playing God and saying we're ugly and bad and fallen and that they are going to be gods.
[00:49:30.302 --> 00:49:33.464]  We're in a science fiction dystopic movie, okay?
[00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:35.645]  And so of course I'm excited when I talk about it.
[00:49:36.225 --> 00:49:45.749]  I've read probably 30 books they've written, hundreds of white papers, thousands of statements admitting this is their worldview and their cosmology.
[00:49:48.052 --> 00:49:52.815]  And I'm just an average fighting Texan telling you right now, I'm not signing on to this crap.
[00:49:54.195 --> 00:50:06.682]  And I cannot tell you, because I'm a journalist, how many times off record they say, hey, you get it, of course you understand it, you should join us, the general public is profane, they're ugly, they're fallen, they're going to tear you apart, they don't want to be free.
[00:50:08.055 --> 00:50:10.216]  And it's true about 80% of people want to be slaves on average.
[00:50:10.857 --> 00:50:13.178]  But 20, maybe 30% don't want to be slaves.
[00:50:13.599 --> 00:50:16.380]  And I'm not going to just shine on to evil.
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:20.183]  Plus, the globalists helped dumb people down to control them.
[00:50:20.463 --> 00:50:23.425]  It'd be one thing if they were this stupid on accident.
[00:50:25.066 --> 00:50:32.851]  You sit there with these formulaic systems of bull and I watch it unfold and I'm not going to sign on to screwing people over.
[00:50:35.114 --> 00:50:37.194]  Because that goes against my basic programming.
[00:50:37.735 --> 00:50:53.178]  I do have free will, but my basic innate humanity... Screwing somebody over, who hasn't done something to me, is like screwing myself.
[00:50:53.878 --> 00:50:55.018]  It's like cheating myself.
[00:50:56.318 --> 00:50:58.699]  Because I have basic civilization programming.
[00:50:59.775 --> 00:51:06.081]  And all these cheaters and scammers that live in civilization and act like they're building it because they've hijacked it as they run it down.
[00:51:06.962 --> 00:51:08.243]  They're the cancer, folks!
[00:51:08.363 --> 00:51:09.384]  They're the problem!
[00:51:10.625 --> 00:51:13.648]  By the way, many people think screwing someone over gets them ahead.
[00:51:13.668 --> 00:51:16.571]  It's like Jay-Z, I have an article here, tricked a bunch of his fans.
[00:51:18.833 --> 00:51:19.974]  That's another one of these people.
[00:51:20.014 --> 00:51:21.156]  I've got so many of these articles.
[00:51:23.641 --> 00:51:28.202]  YouTube, for years, runs these scams on iTunes and other platforms.
[00:51:28.482 --> 00:51:32.063]  When you go try to boot it up, it loads it on and charges you.
[00:51:32.263 --> 00:51:34.283]  And even after they get caught doing it, they don't care.
[00:51:34.504 --> 00:51:37.124]  They've expanded it to other platforms like Spotify now.
[00:51:37.844 --> 00:51:39.145]  You're like, oh, why do you care about that?
[00:51:39.165 --> 00:51:40.885]  The point is, it's just ridiculous.
[00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:43.206]  They're robbing millions of people.
[00:51:43.226 --> 00:51:44.266]  We can't even stop them.
[00:51:44.486 --> 00:51:48.907]  We can't even organize to stop that stupid little bastard with red sunglasses.
[00:51:49.844 --> 00:51:57.146]  Who rips off all the people for billions and doesn't give even hardly 1% to the starving Africans he claims he's helping?
[00:52:01.147 --> 00:52:03.347]  There's a special place in hell for these people.
[00:52:03.748 --> 00:52:10.449]  And I don't care if it's Jay-Z or Kanye West or Bono or any of them.
[00:52:10.529 --> 00:52:11.389]  I'm sick of them.
[00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:17.211]  Look at Kanye West trick fans into subscribing to title lawsuit claims.
[00:52:20.233 --> 00:52:21.174]  Well, of course they do.
[00:52:21.194 --> 00:52:25.217]  I mean, it's all about, send me 25 million, I'm going broke, when he wasn't going broke.
[00:52:25.237 --> 00:52:28.720]  It's all about pimping his fans, getting it over on them.
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:30.481]  That's what a man does.
[00:52:30.802 --> 00:52:39.849]  No, a man builds civilization and technology and advances people and produces art and literature and culture and lifts everything up and is strong.
[00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:43.932]  They don't sit there and feed on the weak, you stupid slave master.
[00:52:45.954 --> 00:52:49.197]  He's just like the black Africans that sold their own people into slavery.
[00:52:50.899 --> 00:52:51.760]  He's a slave master.
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.483]  He's a pimp selling them there at the dock.
[00:52:54.865 --> 00:53:00.813]  And so is all the rest of these people like Madonna and Bono and all the rest of them.
[00:53:02.636 --> 00:53:04.018]  Speaking of funding.
[00:53:07.742 --> 00:53:11.123]  We are funded by you buying the products we sell.
[00:53:11.143 --> 00:53:12.484]  That's 80% of our funding.
[00:53:12.504 --> 00:53:13.844]  I like to be independent from sponsors.
[00:53:14.065 --> 00:53:16.225]  You hear ads on local affiliates and you hear national ads.
[00:53:17.006 --> 00:53:20.267]  Most of that isn't our advertising and I'm sure it's all great, whatever, that's not me.
[00:53:20.847 --> 00:53:27.250]  We sell stuff you need like non-GMO heirloom open pollinated seeds with the widest selection, lowest prices you're going to find anywhere.
[00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:28.330]  We work hard to do that.
[00:53:31.792 --> 00:53:32.512]  We sell life.
[00:53:32.872 --> 00:53:37.274]  We sell what we want, what we need, what you think you need to survive.
[00:53:38.646 --> 00:53:45.652]  What we think we need to survive, in our best estimation, the highest quality water filters, gravity fed, at the lowest prices we possibly can.
[00:53:45.992 --> 00:53:47.213]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:53:48.475 --> 00:53:49.115]  Deep cleanse.
[00:53:50.216 --> 00:53:56.722]  Whole bunch of compounds from Mother Nation to pull out the toxins, to pull out the garbage, to pull out the trash.
[00:53:57.892 --> 00:53:59.113]  To detoxify the body.
[00:53:59.713 --> 00:54:05.617]  Since I've gotten on herbs, since I've gotten healthy, since I've taken the Survival Shield 999X2, since I've done the deep cleanse.
[00:54:05.977 --> 00:54:07.418]  I mean, I am just so much more energized.
[00:54:07.478 --> 00:54:08.318]  I look so much better.
[00:54:08.398 --> 00:54:09.099]  Everybody can see it.
[00:54:09.119 --> 00:54:11.600]  And I don't claim to be a movie star or anything.
[00:54:12.201 --> 00:54:13.562]  The point is, I look a hell of a lot better.
[00:54:13.602 --> 00:54:14.402]  I'm a hell of a lot healthier.
[00:54:14.422 --> 00:54:16.423]  I've lost a lot of weight, and I'm feeling good.
[00:54:17.064 --> 00:54:22.607]  I'm mission-driven, and I'm healthy, and I'm blocking the estrogen mimickers naturally with Super Mel Vitality.
[00:54:22.927 --> 00:54:25.009]  I'm blocking the bad halogens with Survival Shield X2.
[00:54:25.689 --> 00:54:26.790]  I'm giving my glands what they need.
[00:54:28.868 --> 00:54:31.289]  You can go to InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:35.030]  We've got 20% off Deep Cleanse for a limited time right now, and that's our best seller.
[00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:38.150]  We can never keep it in stock, but in the aggregate, it is our best seller.
[00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:40.951]  It is an amazing, all-in-one Deep Cleanse.
[00:54:41.951 --> 00:54:48.293]  But separately, let me talk about something that funds our operation, but really is about a meme, and is really about victory in the information war.
[00:54:48.493 --> 00:54:56.915]  We're going to start the second hour, get to Nigel Farage clips, the British exit, your phone calls, what's happening in the global economy, what's happening in the 2016 election, and so much more.
[00:54:57.773 --> 00:55:05.300]  But before I go any further, there was an article that Adon Salazar wrote on Friday that I wanted to point your attention to.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.722]  I'm going to retweet this at Real Alex Jones during the break.
[00:55:09.283 --> 00:55:14.908]  Top Google trend for a week running is Hillary Clinton going to jail.
[00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:21.654]  Search engine users curious if Clinton crimes merit prison time.
[00:55:23.413 --> 00:55:30.659]  Most Google users searching for information on Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton are asking if Hillary Clinton is going to jail.
[00:55:30.719 --> 00:55:31.840]  That's the most common search.
[00:55:33.701 --> 00:55:34.922]  The company reported Friday.
[00:55:34.982 --> 00:55:35.562]  You can go back.
[00:55:38.064 --> 00:55:39.666]  In the last week it was the number one search.
[00:55:40.626 --> 00:55:43.388]  The second most trending search topic in the last 24 hours asked
[00:55:44.366 --> 00:55:46.187]  Which party Hillary Clinton represented.
[00:55:46.247 --> 00:55:54.432]  That's the 60% that don't vote or so on average that are starting to get Interface involved and trying to do some research.
[00:55:57.033 --> 00:56:01.395]  But we have a graph here of the interest over time since 2004 to present.
[00:56:01.415 --> 00:56:06.198]  You can see it exploding in the last year since we introduced Hillary for President.
[00:56:06.598 --> 00:56:11.301]  And they go on and even mainstream articles to admit, we have some of those screenshots here,
[00:56:12.827 --> 00:56:19.093]  That Donald Trump has been beating the drum that Hillary needs to go to prison while pointing at Hillary for prison shirts in his crowd.
[00:56:19.353 --> 00:56:22.776]  That's what started him almost a year ago saying that.
[00:56:23.457 --> 00:56:23.857]  And now...
[00:56:24.983 --> 00:56:30.145]  The shirts look like a Hillary campaign shirt, so they don't block it off TV at first until they notice.
[00:56:30.465 --> 00:56:31.746]  It says Hillary for prison 2016.
[00:56:32.246 --> 00:56:38.569]  And we have got all the different screenshots of Trump mentioning she needs to go to jail and talking about Infowars.
[00:56:39.149 --> 00:56:40.550]  We've got it on CNN.
[00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:41.850]  We've got Hillary for prison.
[00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:50.974]  Somebody hacked highway signs all over Texas for a second time and said Hillary for prison.
[00:56:52.543 --> 00:56:53.623]  Isn't that just special?
[00:56:53.983 --> 00:57:00.185]  Hillary for prison has become a frequent staple of Trump campaign stops, with many donning the shirt in a show of solidarity.
[00:57:00.925 --> 00:57:14.608]  Well, by the way, we're offering 50% off at Infowarsstore.com on the shirt, even as it's about to sell out, and 75% off when you sign up for Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:57:15.657 --> 00:57:18.922]  Put in your email, we'll send you the promo code to get it at $4.95.
[00:57:18.982 --> 00:57:19.703]  That's at cost.
[00:57:20.484 --> 00:57:22.407]  And, uh, this is a limited edition.
[00:57:22.447 --> 00:57:23.128]  It's about to sell out.
[00:57:23.148 --> 00:57:25.893]  We're gonna have another one that's almost the same, but another limited edition.
[00:57:25.913 --> 00:57:27.154]  That'll be the final limited edition.
[00:57:27.675 --> 00:57:29.758]  If she ends up getting elected, it'll be in Peach Hillary.
[00:57:30.937 --> 00:57:31.877]  Or bust, I guess.
[00:57:32.777 --> 00:57:39.498]  But this is a great way to show our numbers and to show that we understand she's a criminal and she's not invincible.
[00:57:39.639 --> 00:57:42.199]  And believe me, it's got us on our radar screen big time.
[00:57:42.579 --> 00:57:46.860]  This meme is really catching on and was the number one search term in the last week on Google.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.100]  Is she going to prison?
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:50.800]  You bet she is if we take action and spread the word.
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:52.401]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:52.521 --> 00:57:56.541]  Get your shirt for 50% off or sign up for the free newsletter and get 75% off.
[00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:15.303]  Last name Bush.
[00:58:15.623 --> 00:58:16.204]  Guess what?
[00:58:17.025 --> 00:58:19.286]  He helped run a bank funding Nazis.
[00:58:19.306 --> 00:58:21.768]  Well, you think that Hitler got his tank money, Papi?
[00:58:21.969 --> 00:58:24.571]  Hitler made a killin' and Prescott made a gillin'.
[00:58:24.591 --> 00:58:28.134]  Congratulations, the Bush family got millions.
[00:58:28.854 --> 00:58:30.155]  That's a lot of loot now.
[00:58:30.235 --> 00:58:31.576]  Time to turn it up now.
[00:58:31.676 --> 00:58:32.957]  Ain't no turnin' back now.
[00:58:33.017 --> 00:58:33.938]  Prescott had a son.
[00:58:34.198 --> 00:58:35.479]  His name was Herbert Walker.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:36.921]  Lil' Herbert Walker.
[00:58:36.961 --> 00:58:37.661]  He was slow.
[00:58:38.382 --> 00:58:39.743]  Messin' with the skull and bones.
[00:58:39.803 --> 00:58:41.084]  Illuminati on his own.
[00:59:03.951 --> 00:59:05.972]  It's time to get him down to Dallas.
[00:59:07.533 --> 00:59:20.262]  And then Herbert Walker became the Vice President of Press.
[00:59:20.362 --> 00:59:22.083]  New World Order's what he says.
[00:59:22.303 --> 00:59:24.785]  Military, industrial complex.
[00:59:25.145 --> 00:59:27.647]  Call out group more war, more checks.
[00:59:28.508 --> 00:59:30.409]  There's a lot of money in conflicts.
[00:59:33.936 --> 00:59:35.897]  He became the president like his father.
[00:59:36.017 --> 00:59:38.858]  Next up on the mic, create a new Pearl Harbor.
[00:59:39.119 --> 00:59:39.979]  Incredible!
[00:59:40.059 --> 00:59:46.802]  On September 11th, Bush and the head of the Bin Laden family would be at the same Carlyle Group meeting in Washington.
[00:59:46.882 --> 00:59:51.245]  A few miles before Osama Bin Laden's hijackers would attack the building.
[00:59:51.285 --> 00:59:56.767]  Bush, Cheney, and the Bin Laden Group gained everything they had wanted as a direct result of 9-11.
[00:59:56.847 --> 00:59:57.908]  And of course, U.S.
[00:59:58.108 --> 00:59:59.569]  oil and arms companies.
[01:00:03.402 --> 01:00:06.104]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:13.288 --> 01:00:19.311]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:19.931 --> 01:00:22.953]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:23.073 --> 01:00:25.414]  This is one of the articles up on Infowars.com.
[01:00:25.434 --> 01:00:28.016]  The Pope has come out, even just a month ago, he's done it again.
[01:00:29.909 --> 01:00:30.390]  The Pope.
[01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:32.215]  Muslim migrants are like Jesus.
[01:00:32.255 --> 01:00:33.919]  Yeah, except they didn't go around raping women.
[01:00:36.786 --> 01:00:37.748]  Truly insane.
[01:00:39.721 --> 01:00:47.324]  Meanwhile, Trump's been talking about Hillary takes millions from anti-gay, anti-women regimes, but they come out and call Trump a sexist.
[01:00:48.045 --> 01:00:53.307]  And a lot of leftists go along with that because they're not true liberals in the sense of more freedom.
[01:00:53.807 --> 01:01:00.410]  They're just an authoritarian cult of pseudo-intellectual idiots who can care less about anybody's freedoms, including their own.
[01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:04.892]  They just want to delusionally feel like they're on some type of sick winning team.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:11.161]  I'm going to get back into the British exit, what a big deal that is, coming up at the start of the next segment.
[01:01:11.181 --> 01:01:12.702]  Then I'm going to be taking your phone calls.
[01:01:13.722 --> 01:01:17.583]  All I ask is that you have a really good telephone and that you be to the point and moving forward.
[01:01:18.044 --> 01:01:23.205]  I know I tend to make people hold forever so that we either have great calls or we have horrible calls because a lot of people sit there.
[01:01:23.545 --> 01:01:24.566]  I'm not going to do that today.
[01:01:25.086 --> 01:01:31.848]  At the start of the third segment that's only about 18 minutes away, I will go directly to your phone calls.
[01:01:32.468 --> 01:01:35.369]  And the toll-free number to join us on Obama
[01:01:36.454 --> 01:01:37.555]  Ignoring the Supreme Court?
[01:01:38.615 --> 01:01:41.837]  Oh my gosh, when they said same-sex marriage was, you know, A-OK.
[01:01:43.778 --> 01:01:45.539]  He lit up the White House in a rainbow.
[01:01:46.739 --> 01:01:54.723]  And then when they say, yeah, there's a law where you can't just bring in anybody and not even check their ID and legalize them and say they have all the rights of a citizen.
[01:01:55.384 --> 01:01:58.946]  So the right has, the citizen has a right to pay your, pay for you.
[01:01:59.566 --> 01:02:02.087]  And then you're just above the law and tax exempt and are a god.
[01:02:03.648 --> 01:02:05.209]  Like a mini version of George Soros.
[01:02:06.368 --> 01:02:06.528]  No.
[01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:09.450]  I mean, that's so crazy.
[01:02:13.233 --> 01:02:18.898]  In fact, it's so crazy, I'll be honest with you, I can't even believe the globalists have gotten this far.
[01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:34.358]  I mean, it's wild that in Europe, the United States and Canada, they just open the borders up and you'll see Canadian families, when I've flown in several times, being bitched out and screamed at by customs because they didn't dot an I, literally, on a customs form.
[01:02:34.638 --> 01:02:41.503]  And then you'll just see people from China with Chinese passports just, boom, you're in, boom, you're in, boom, you're in.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:49.728]  But they want to break the Canadians because there's some history of Western freedom, some history of Western background, some history of Magna Carta.
[01:02:49.988 --> 01:02:58.137]  Oh, you're from a country where they sell political dissidence organs and children are chained up outside the factories on power poles to defecate in the street and get one meal a day?
[01:02:58.537 --> 01:02:59.878]  Come on in, baby.
[01:02:59.918 --> 01:03:00.759]  That's who we want.
[01:03:02.481 --> 01:03:03.082]  Same thing here.
[01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:06.529]  And they go, oh, you're against Chinese people.
[01:03:06.609 --> 01:03:09.150]  Oh, because the government has mobile execution vans and they have no rights?
[01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:10.611]  I'm against them?
[01:03:11.331 --> 01:03:13.331]  That's how the mental illness of political correctness is.
[01:03:13.371 --> 01:03:14.692]  Like, knowledge is evil.
[01:03:15.252 --> 01:03:16.512]  Words are bad.
[01:03:16.812 --> 01:03:18.793]  Being informed is a little weird.
[01:03:18.893 --> 01:03:19.553]  I'm a trendy.
[01:03:19.613 --> 01:03:20.693]  I just want to say racist.
[01:03:20.953 --> 01:03:23.334]  And you're like, hey, you're being made a slave.
[01:03:23.654 --> 01:03:24.774]  Shut up, I don't care.
[01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:25.355]  Whatever.
[01:03:26.755 --> 01:03:29.536]  They're coming out with boxes in all the cars that tax you by the mile.
[01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:30.276]  This is 10 years ago.
[01:03:30.476 --> 01:03:30.976]  They're going to do it.
[01:03:30.996 --> 01:03:31.516]  Here's their documents.
[01:03:31.556 --> 01:03:32.757]  Oh, shut up, I don't care.
[01:03:32.957 --> 01:03:33.537]  That'll never happen.
[01:03:35.694 --> 01:03:37.575]  And once it's here, it's like, I like it, it's liberal!
[01:03:38.976 --> 01:03:43.359]  It's meant to control you and give you less resources so that they can injure the economy.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:45.240]  Here's our own admissions.
[01:03:46.601 --> 01:03:48.402]  Uh-huh, sure, I'm a thug.
[01:03:48.442 --> 01:03:51.964]  You're like, listen, please, there's cancer viruses in the vaccine.
[01:03:52.184 --> 01:03:55.386]  Here's a hundred different news articles and documents all admitting it.
[01:03:56.027 --> 01:03:57.888]  Shut up, racist!
[01:03:58.649 --> 01:04:00.610]  But I'm warning you, I care about you.
[01:04:02.159 --> 01:04:02.700]  Uh-huh.
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.882]  You're weak because you try to warn me.
[01:04:04.982 --> 01:04:06.304]  I just walk around act trendy.
[01:04:08.306 --> 01:04:10.649]  And the elite just go, wipe them out.
[01:04:10.949 --> 01:04:11.390]  Join us.
[01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:13.192]  Wipe them out.
[01:04:14.206 --> 01:04:14.786]  Wipe them out.
[01:04:14.846 --> 01:04:15.807]  They want to be wiped out.
[01:04:15.847 --> 01:04:16.607]  They don't want your help.
[01:04:17.107 --> 01:04:17.947]  It doesn't matter.
[01:04:18.368 --> 01:04:23.469]  I can't give over my soul and my dignity and join the dark side that's helped engineer all this.
[01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:24.990]  That's how it works.
[01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:31.392]  You join the cult of laughing at all the scum, laughing at how dumb they are, laughing at how stupid they are.
[01:04:31.672 --> 01:04:34.173]  The problem is the globalists running and are even worse!
[01:04:36.734 --> 01:04:38.715]  But the trendies don't know they're being laughed at.
[01:04:39.724 --> 01:04:40.665]  Toll-free number to join us.
[01:04:40.725 --> 01:04:44.146]  This is the Sunday number, different than the weekday number.
[01:04:44.166 --> 01:04:44.527]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:04:45.027 --> 01:04:51.330]  First-time callers, by the way, today.
[01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:51.571]  877-789-2539.
[01:04:51.591 --> 01:04:51.831]  877-789-2539.
[01:04:52.231 --> 01:04:54.132]  The first five, six callers will make first-timers.
[01:04:54.152 --> 01:04:57.174]  I'll go to them first, and then other folks can call in about five minutes.
[01:04:57.534 --> 01:05:00.295]  We'll, you know, get long-time callers, people that disagree or whatever.
[01:05:00.315 --> 01:05:02.036]  But I want to give first-time callers a shot.
[01:05:02.056 --> 01:05:02.216]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:05:02.236 --> 01:05:02.276]  877-789-2539.
[01:05:07.239 --> 01:05:09.860]  I'm Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist, because I think 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:05:11.781 --> 01:05:14.083]  Joe Bates here with InfoWars.com.
[01:05:14.303 --> 01:05:15.063]  Exclusive!
[01:05:15.223 --> 01:05:18.565]  Paranoid Hillary drove demoralized Secret Service to drink.
[01:05:18.705 --> 01:05:20.006]  Do drugs have hookers?
[01:05:20.186 --> 01:05:21.947]  Says officer who protected Bridezilla.
[01:05:22.047 --> 01:05:29.991]  A blockbuster book set for release on Monday paints Hillary Clinton as a shrewish and paranoid monster during her time as America's First Lady.
[01:05:30.171 --> 01:05:41.217]  Many turn to alcohol and drugs and performance enhancers and all kinds of other crazy stuff, writes Byron in his upcoming memoir called Crisis of Character, a book about his tenure working with Hillary Clinton.
[01:05:41.377 --> 01:05:41.537]  Ms.
[01:05:41.557 --> 01:05:42.338]  Clinton was a joke.
[01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:43.638]  She was a fake leader.
[01:05:43.798 --> 01:05:47.761]  All bark, no bite, but in a very real power position as first lady.
[01:05:47.941 --> 01:05:52.223]  Daily Mail Online has obtained a copy of Byron's book in advance of publication.
[01:05:52.363 --> 01:05:59.627]  It paints a picture of Hillary's paranoia about the agents and officers protecting her and her family, describing how it bled through in shouting matches
[01:05:59.807 --> 01:06:00.847]  These are our people.
[01:06:00.867 --> 01:06:01.648]  This is our land.
[01:06:01.668 --> 01:06:02.188]  These are our people.
[01:06:25.987 --> 01:06:27.569]  These are our people.
[01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:30.032]  The workers.
[01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:31.393]  The strivers.
[01:06:31.473 --> 01:06:32.474]  The builders.
[01:06:32.494 --> 01:06:33.295]  Who are they?
[01:06:33.335 --> 01:06:34.396]  These are our people.
[01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:42.493]  Who are they?
[01:06:42.633 --> 01:06:44.734]  They are the Dark Armies.
[01:06:45.455 --> 01:06:49.438]  The dark, murdering armies whose only honor is atrocity.
[01:06:49.478 --> 01:06:50.239]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:50.279 --> 01:06:52.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:09.251]  I want to take your phone calls.
[01:07:09.271 --> 01:07:12.272]  Just hold for a number to join us.
[01:07:12.352 --> 01:07:13.232]  It's 877-789-ALEX.
[01:07:13.252 --> 01:07:13.472]  877-789-2539.
[01:07:13.752 --> 01:07:18.394]  That is the Sunday number because we produce this whole show here in studio.
[01:07:18.974 --> 01:07:30.118]  I've been 20 years, 21 years on air, about 20 syndicated and back in the old days I would do it out of my home studio and just let them take the calls and run it and I would say their name and go to them having their name on a computer screen.
[01:07:30.138 --> 01:07:30.779]  Still do that today.
[01:07:32.037 --> 01:07:35.941]  And so, normally Genesis takes the phone calls up in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[01:07:36.362 --> 01:07:39.145]  That's our syndicator, our satellite platform.
[01:07:39.765 --> 01:07:48.355]  But the Sunday show is all contiguous, it's all homogeneous, I guess you could say, to this studio on Sundays.
[01:07:48.915 --> 01:07:50.417]  So that's why the number is different.
[01:07:51.303 --> 01:08:14.111]  Okay, where to begin, where to start here, obviously, recapping the Brexit, the British exit, despite all the propaganda, all the media demonization, all the lies, huge election fraud that was confirmed and reported, still the people of Britain, I guess reaching back to their vestigial roots of being the only folks that the Romans couldn't conquer,
[01:08:16.519 --> 01:08:24.684]  said no to the EU and that's because of Lord Monckton and Nigel Farage and others that several decades ago founded the UKIP party.
[01:08:25.885 --> 01:08:30.468]  And UKIP is pretty much Ron Paul-esque, probably not even as hardcore.
[01:08:31.169 --> 01:08:33.010]  You know, let's say hardcore-wise,
[01:08:34.403 --> 01:08:39.546]  I'm a 10, and of course there's folks more hardcore, but I think I get as hardcore as is reasonable.
[01:08:39.846 --> 01:08:41.728]  You can find folks that are a 20 or a 30 out there.
[01:08:42.088 --> 01:08:47.271]  But let's just say on the scale of saying I'm about as radical as you can get safely.
[01:08:48.452 --> 01:08:52.754]  By safely I mean without feeding into the globalist loop of civil war.
[01:08:53.475 --> 01:08:59.739]  I really go as far as I can to try to wake people up and try to really change society without causing infighting and civil war.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.821]  I mean, I'm really trying to fix stuff.
[01:09:01.881 --> 01:09:03.881]  I really believe the pen is mightier than the sword.
[01:09:04.362 --> 01:09:08.304]  I don't get off on, you know, twisted dreams of physical confrontation.
[01:09:08.664 --> 01:09:10.725]  The globalists want to go to that because they think they can win that.
[01:09:11.465 --> 01:09:13.666]  They definitely can't win a velvet revolution of ideas.
[01:09:14.126 --> 01:09:24.311]  Most revolutions are actually intellectual, business, corporate, intellectual developments, societal, technological.
[01:09:26.698 --> 01:09:27.759]  They don't call those revolutions.
[01:09:27.799 --> 01:09:33.904]  They always want to bill revolution as, you know, killing people, because those are the hardest to win.
[01:09:34.284 --> 01:09:35.665]  Almost all of those are lost.
[01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:45.614]  Almost all of those create something worse than what you had before historically, except for ours, because ours was 90% intellectual, 10% physical.
[01:09:45.694 --> 01:09:46.635]  And the founders said that.
[01:09:47.135 --> 01:09:51.018]  We had 3% of the country fighting, maybe 2% supporting.
[01:09:52.369 --> 01:09:53.910]  By the end of the war, it was 30-40%.
[01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:55.512]  The British knew it was shifting against them.
[01:09:55.812 --> 01:09:57.253]  After six years, they had to back off.
[01:09:58.554 --> 01:10:02.398]  But ours was a velvet revolution backed up by a gun.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:05.981]  And it may go to that.
[01:10:08.443 --> 01:10:11.125]  And God knows I'll be one of the first targets they're going to try to take out.
[01:10:11.465 --> 01:10:17.050]  Not because I'm going to be leading some physical operation, but because I'm an intellectual leader.
[01:10:19.592 --> 01:10:20.193]  A born leader.
[01:10:21.397 --> 01:10:29.383]  And not because I'm even the sharpest knife in the drawer or my elevator doesn't go all the way up to Valhalla, but I'll tell you this, I'm not out to screw people.
[01:10:29.903 --> 01:10:30.704]  I got good will.
[01:10:31.565 --> 01:10:33.446]  I believe in humanity and I have vision.
[01:10:34.026 --> 01:10:41.012]  A purpose-driven life of wanting others to succeed and wanting to believe in others because I'm self-confident.
[01:10:42.273 --> 01:10:47.617]  And the minute I start trying to think of bringing other people down, I feel weak and pathetic and not like a leader.
[01:10:47.637 --> 01:10:50.078]  And that's what a leader is.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:56.442]  Is somebody who's first at the scene, ready to take action, not afraid of criticism.
[01:10:57.183 --> 01:11:00.724]  To quote Mark Twain, in the beginning, a patriot's a scarce man, hated, feared, scorned.
[01:11:01.124 --> 01:11:04.566]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, it's him adjoining, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:11:07.807 --> 01:11:15.491]  And I remember being three years old at the daycare Christmas, um,
[01:11:18.285 --> 01:11:19.165]  Whatever you call it, play.
[01:11:19.966 --> 01:11:21.826]  And they had like 20 kids there.
[01:11:21.846 --> 01:11:22.746]  Nice little daycare.
[01:11:22.786 --> 01:11:24.087]  My mom worked at Dallas Morning News.
[01:11:24.387 --> 01:11:26.228]  My dad was finishing medical school.
[01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:28.288]  He finished the next year.
[01:11:28.308 --> 01:11:31.429]  It was a nice little daycare and they had the thing and none of the kids would come out.
[01:11:31.909 --> 01:11:33.090]  None of them would do the play.
[01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:38.391]  I'd been given a little roll of the moo the cow that brought milk to the baby Jesus.
[01:11:39.952 --> 01:11:43.193]  And I remember watching all the kids not come out, all of them being scared.
[01:11:44.394 --> 01:11:53.419]  All of them not willing to speak, all of them crying, and like a hundred adults out there wanting to watch the kids on the little stage they had.
[01:11:53.439 --> 01:11:57.862]  I remember saying, well, I can't let everybody be bummed out and everybody be losers.
[01:11:58.302 --> 01:12:00.483]  I remember thinking, I can't let everybody be scared.
[01:12:00.523 --> 01:12:01.263]  Why are they scared?
[01:12:01.303 --> 01:12:02.504]  It's fun to go out and do this.
[01:12:02.864 --> 01:12:04.545]  I've got to make everybody happy out there.
[01:12:04.905 --> 01:12:06.787]  I've got to go out and deliver these words.
[01:12:06.827 --> 01:12:08.948]  And I ran out and said, I moo the cow.
[01:12:09.048 --> 01:12:10.929]  I bring milk for the baby Jesus.
[01:12:11.553 --> 01:12:12.795]  Everybody had a standing ovation.
[01:12:12.855 --> 01:12:13.816]  Everybody made a joke about it.
[01:12:13.836 --> 01:12:14.377]  The thing ended.
[01:12:14.818 --> 01:12:15.959]  Not one child took the stage.
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:18.683]  From ages 3 years old to like 7.
[01:12:22.864 --> 01:12:24.684]  And that's that's why I'm here fighting the globalists.
[01:12:24.704 --> 01:12:36.708]  I mean, I'm not going to just sit here and be overrun with propaganda where the UN openly runs open borders and brings in all the people with diseases to collapse the country and admits it's the plan and then tells us it isn't happening.
[01:12:36.748 --> 01:12:37.668]  We have video of it.
[01:12:37.888 --> 01:12:38.448]  Well, guess what?
[01:12:38.528 --> 01:12:39.948]  Years later, it's all over the news.
[01:12:40.228 --> 01:12:42.149]  Years later, it's admitted that's going on.
[01:12:43.513 --> 01:12:46.734]  And I'm not up here saying, oh, look, I'm this great leader, kiss my butt.
[01:12:46.814 --> 01:12:52.277]  I'm saying you just got to care about other people and not want to be run over and do your own research and you'll be a leader as well.
[01:12:53.117 --> 01:12:59.420]  The problem is so many real leaders don't ever get involved in leadership because they're so humble.
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:06.143]  Well, listen, humble, being humble is great, but being a slave is something you don't want to be.
[01:13:06.203 --> 01:13:09.325]  So stand up, speak up, get involved today in my humble view.
[01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:12.286]  We need leaders to stand up and take action.
[01:13:14.434 --> 01:13:18.676]  Speaking of leaders, Nigel Farage, 20-something years ago, founded the UKIP party.
[01:13:19.416 --> 01:13:22.637]  Had no coverage, no support, but kept pointing out the EU's unelected.
[01:13:22.997 --> 01:13:24.898]  We're going into it without being able to vote.
[01:13:24.998 --> 01:13:29.880]  Then they were brought into it without a vote, 15-something years ago, by Tony Blair.
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:32.181]  Then they pointed out almost all their laws were made by it.
[01:13:32.201 --> 01:13:35.962]  Now it's banning free speech, and how it's unelected, and how it's evil.
[01:13:36.603 --> 01:13:38.083]  And finally people said, man, you're right.
[01:13:38.443 --> 01:13:42.285]  And all of a sudden, it's the fastest growing party in Europe and the UK.
[01:13:43.462 --> 01:13:47.305]  And it's Patriot, and he comes on this show, and he's aware of the New World Order.
[01:13:48.767 --> 01:13:51.869]  That shows how, in the beginning, a Patriot's a scarce man.
[01:13:52.350 --> 01:14:00.237]  Hated, feared, and scorned, but in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a Patriot.
[01:14:01.758 --> 01:14:06.022]  I don't want to just be some braying sheep that agrees with the crowd and sells my family out.
[01:14:06.302 --> 01:14:09.225]  If I know something's true, if I know something's run by bad people,
[01:14:10.714 --> 01:14:12.436]  I'm not a hero because I challenge it.
[01:14:12.476 --> 01:14:14.838]  Man, I'm self-preservation here.
[01:14:15.939 --> 01:14:18.121]  I'm somebody who's not going to get pushed around or run over.
[01:14:18.141 --> 01:14:20.423]  And I'm willing to die.
[01:14:21.183 --> 01:14:23.165]  Not because I'm a hero, but because I'm alive.
[01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:25.407]  My progeny's going to go on.
[01:14:25.947 --> 01:14:29.891]  Humanity's going to be successful if we succeed, because I'm like my ancestors.
[01:14:30.672 --> 01:14:33.854]  I'm not going to lay down without a fight.
[01:14:35.175 --> 01:14:36.316]  And that's called civilization.
[01:14:37.557 --> 01:14:37.937]  Goodwill.
[01:14:39.079 --> 01:14:40.240]  Being informed, being involved.
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:43.584]  Let's just play a short clip of this, I'll come back and play the rest, and then we'll go to your phone calls.
[01:14:43.905 --> 01:14:46.528]  Here's somebody who came from nowhere to now be the true leader of Europe.
[01:14:48.029 --> 01:14:49.071]  The sun has risen.
[01:14:50.123 --> 01:14:52.463]  On an independent, united kingdom.
[01:14:53.084 --> 01:14:53.764]  And just look at it.
[01:14:54.024 --> 01:14:55.144]  Even the weather's improved.
[01:14:56.464 --> 01:14:57.885]  It's been a hell of a long journey this.
[01:14:58.065 --> 01:15:01.545]  I first got involved in Eurosceptic politics 25 years ago.
[01:15:02.365 --> 01:15:08.867]  And the first election I contested, I managed to beat the late, great Screaming Lord Such by 164 votes.
[01:15:09.307 --> 01:15:10.207]  So I didn't come last.
[01:15:10.687 --> 01:15:15.228]  And now, there are 17 million people that voted for Brexit.
[01:15:16.048 --> 01:15:19.330]  It's a victory for ordinary people, decent people.
[01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:25.953]  It's a victory against the big merchant banks, against the big businesses, and against big politics.
[01:15:25.993 --> 01:15:35.137]  And I'm proud of everybody that had the courage, in the face of all the threats, everything they were told, they had the guts to stand up and do the right thing.
[01:15:37.136 --> 01:15:48.982]  The election was won, in my view, in the Midlands and the North and I think it was the old Labour vote that came to us and we, particularly as a party, campaigned as hard as we could in those areas.
[01:15:49.363 --> 01:15:59.108]  There is still a massive disconnect between Westminster, SW1 and real communities and the one image I will remember
[01:15:59.808 --> 01:16:02.671]  Throughout the rest of my life was a woman in Bolton grabbing my hands.
[01:16:02.711 --> 01:16:03.732]  Let's back this up.
[01:16:03.752 --> 01:16:04.953]  We're on a break.
[01:16:05.033 --> 01:16:06.335]  This is historic.
[01:16:06.355 --> 01:16:06.875]  Stay with us.
[01:16:07.076 --> 01:16:08.597]  He's now, admittedly, the new leader of Europe.
[01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:11.100]  Brain Force is here.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.922]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:16:14.183 --> 01:16:22.010]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:16:22.785 --> 01:16:25.947]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[01:16:26.227 --> 01:16:26.347]  Right?
[01:16:26.367 --> 01:16:28.708]  You're gonna crash and you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:16:29.089 --> 01:16:32.571]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:16:32.651 --> 01:16:35.772]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:16:36.273 --> 01:16:41.496]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:16:41.616 --> 01:16:43.457]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[01:16:43.797 --> 01:16:48.220]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:50.401]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:16:51.021 --> 01:16:52.482]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:16:52.622 --> 01:16:52.862]  Exactly.
[01:16:52.902 --> 01:16:56.727]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:16:57.188 --> 01:17:04.457]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:17:04.737 --> 01:17:05.177]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:15.746]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[01:17:16.247 --> 01:17:24.157]  Unveil the Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula 30 Servings Fruit Punch Flavor Dietary Supplement.
[01:17:24.477 --> 01:17:25.538]  It is simply amazing.
[01:17:25.598 --> 01:17:26.540]  Infowarslife.com
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.344]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[01:17:31.864 --> 01:17:44.954]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy gross stuff.
[01:17:45.315 --> 01:17:46.536]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[01:17:46.576 --> 01:17:47.757]  I put it in my protein shake.
[01:17:48.377 --> 01:17:53.862]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[01:17:53.882 --> 01:17:56.905]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[01:17:56.945 --> 01:17:59.187]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[01:17:59.788 --> 01:18:05.933]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[01:18:06.154 --> 01:18:08.516]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[01:18:08.876 --> 01:18:10.738]  Okay, this- Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[01:18:10.758 --> 01:18:13.080]  Yeah, this- I wanna- but again, there's some great stuff out there.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:13.460]  Yeah.
[01:18:13.661 --> 01:18:15.163]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[01:18:15.283 --> 01:18:17.607]  There's other powders I promote at Infowars.com.
[01:18:17.627 --> 01:18:18.067]  They're excellent.
[01:18:18.428 --> 01:18:19.650]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[01:18:19.810 --> 01:18:22.494]  This is just the very best we can bring you.
[01:18:22.514 --> 01:18:24.557]  And when you buy it, you support Infowars.
[01:18:24.817 --> 01:18:25.859]  You support the reporters.
[01:18:26.099 --> 01:18:26.860]  You support yourself.
[01:18:28.069 --> 01:18:36.174]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body.
[01:18:36.214 --> 01:18:47.700]  Because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:48.781]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:48.841 --> 01:18:51.963]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[01:18:51.983 --> 01:18:53.324]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[01:18:53.344 --> 01:18:54.264]  Tell folks about that.
[01:18:54.304 --> 01:18:56.786]  A thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[01:18:57.626 --> 01:19:00.308]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[01:19:00.888 --> 01:19:07.252]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine, each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[01:19:07.673 --> 01:19:10.875]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and list goes on.
[01:19:11.135 --> 01:19:12.416]  34 other ones you can check out.
[01:19:12.616 --> 01:19:14.457]  Go to infowarslife.com, the label's up there.
[01:19:14.977 --> 01:19:19.560]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can neurotically examine for yourself.
[01:19:20.641 --> 01:19:25.084]  By the way, look on the other side, too, because we're showing people the minerals and things.
[01:19:25.124 --> 01:19:26.965]  Let's look at the vitamins right there, old Scott, in there.
[01:19:26.985 --> 01:19:27.865]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:19:28.025 --> 01:19:31.587]  Again, if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:19:31.948 --> 01:19:35.009]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's that other source?
[01:19:35.690 --> 01:19:38.431]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[01:19:40.143 --> 01:19:40.563]  Retinol.
[01:19:40.583 --> 01:19:45.044]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose actually.
[01:19:45.384 --> 01:19:45.784]  And you know what?
[01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:48.024]  Some people could say, well isn't this competing with the other products?
[01:19:48.244 --> 01:19:48.845]  Well yeah, you know what?
[01:19:48.865 --> 01:19:55.886]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[01:19:56.206 --> 01:20:00.367]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it.
[01:20:00.407 --> 01:20:01.747]  Because we can't start thinking like that.
[01:20:02.247 --> 01:20:03.067]  So get them today!
[01:20:03.167 --> 01:20:05.208]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:20:13.928 --> 01:20:16.536]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.246 --> 01:20:23.448]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:23.508 --> 01:20:24.709]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.429 --> 01:20:35.477]  I see on my TV screen here, my monitor, the callers coming in, there's like 11 of them on hold.
[01:20:46.551 --> 01:20:50.514]  And it's Scottish John says Brexit issue disturbing news.
[01:20:50.534 --> 01:20:55.277]  I don't know what he's going to say, but I'm guessing he's going to get into the pitfalls of it.
[01:20:55.297 --> 01:20:58.739]  How globalists are planning to use it to create a new scam.
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:05.823]  How Scotland says they want to block the England's attempt to pull out.
[01:21:06.624 --> 01:21:07.704]  We're going to cover all that.
[01:21:07.724 --> 01:21:08.585]  We're going to take your calls.
[01:21:09.205 --> 01:21:10.786]  And yes, there's going to be pitfalls.
[01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:11.607]  Nothing's perfect.
[01:21:11.647 --> 01:21:13.488]  But unelected EU.
[01:21:15.285 --> 01:21:24.212]  Taking over the UK without there ever being a vote, and now trying to ban people's free speech and becoming openly dictatorial, it's blowing up in their face.
[01:21:24.292 --> 01:21:30.537]  And from Spain to the Netherlands, they now have prominent leaders saying it's time for us to exit.
[01:21:30.937 --> 01:21:39.484]  And they have the leader of the Czech Republic, and the leader of Romania, and the leader of Hungary, and the second most powerful party in Germany calling it a tyranny.
[01:21:41.417 --> 01:21:47.200]  We couldn't even get people 20 years ago to admit they were setting up an EU when it was already set up.
[01:21:50.622 --> 01:21:51.862]  They would say there isn't an EU.
[01:21:51.882 --> 01:21:54.844]  It doesn't start until 2000 when it was already under treaty going.
[01:21:55.304 --> 01:21:59.867]  I mean, that's the games we played fighting these globalists.
[01:22:00.007 --> 01:22:00.967]  But it's not a game.
[01:22:01.067 --> 01:22:02.048]  But they act like it is.
[01:22:02.088 --> 01:22:07.991]  It just goes back and forth, these games they make you play, of trying to get the public to even know something exists.
[01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:14.709]  And they called UKIP racist and all sorts of names that tried every dirty trick in the book!
[01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:18.450]  And all UKIP says is we can't have totally open borders and give everybody free stuff.
[01:22:18.991 --> 01:22:20.371]  This is the globalist program.
[01:22:20.391 --> 01:22:26.174]  So let's finish up a little bit of Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, fastest growing party in the UK, fastest growing in Europe.
[01:22:26.674 --> 01:22:28.675]  It's UKIP, UK Independence Party.
[01:22:29.335 --> 01:22:30.396]  Get out of the EU.
[01:22:30.436 --> 01:22:33.217]  They have a ceremonial EU parliament.
[01:22:33.577 --> 01:22:39.080]  He got elected to that and gets up every week and points out that they have no power and the bureaucracy runs everything.
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:40.160]  And who set that up?
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:41.021]  A bunch of billionaires.
[01:22:41.781 --> 01:22:43.222]  The EU is a giant scam.
[01:22:43.282 --> 01:22:45.983]  People say, well why was George Soros involved in the EU?
[01:22:48.104 --> 01:22:52.807]  And wanting an EU bailout in Ukraine and backing it but now he's making money off of it.
[01:22:52.827 --> 01:22:54.748]  Because these guys play both sides.
[01:22:55.529 --> 01:22:59.751]  But just because they're playing both sides doesn't mean we're losers by battling
[01:23:01.513 --> 01:23:05.734]  The EU's tyranny, and then they just jump over and try to control the opposition.
[01:23:05.934 --> 01:23:08.235]  That's how this works, and we fight them at that level.
[01:23:08.835 --> 01:23:10.676]  We're fighting unelected government.
[01:23:11.116 --> 01:23:13.256]  We're fighting global centralization.
[01:23:13.496 --> 01:23:17.438]  We're fighting taxation boxes in your smart meter in your car.
[01:23:17.678 --> 01:23:21.659]  We're informing people to the scams that aren't free market.
[01:23:22.611 --> 01:23:28.257]  We want to have a system based on justice, and voting with your dollars, and a free, open society, and a renaissance.
[01:23:28.618 --> 01:23:37.627]  Not one based on UN bureaucrats above the law, tax-exempt, with diplomatic immunity, owning and running global corporations that are exempt from carbon taxes.
[01:23:38.608 --> 01:23:44.234]  You know that a whole bunch of UN officials, like Pachari and others, are exempt from carbon taxes.
[01:23:45.117 --> 01:23:46.638]  So of course they're factories.
[01:23:46.698 --> 01:23:54.364]  They own factories and power plants next to them and everybody goes to build their factory there because they're above the law.
[01:23:54.745 --> 01:23:55.505]  You can't compete.
[01:23:55.525 --> 01:23:56.306]  That's what Donald Trump says.
[01:23:56.326 --> 01:23:59.728]  He goes, yeah, I print my shirts in China and Mexico.
[01:23:59.969 --> 01:24:01.210]  You can't afford to do it here.
[01:24:03.031 --> 01:24:04.372]  I want to change the deal or I can do it here.
[01:24:04.772 --> 01:24:06.614]  We get shirts made in America.
[01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:11.966]  A normal t-shirt printed in America costs us $14 to $15 a piece.
[01:24:12.226 --> 01:24:14.667]  We sell it for $25, and after everything, make like $5.
[01:24:15.908 --> 01:24:18.550]  I can get it printed in Mexico for $3, $4.
[01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:23.953]  And I can then sell it for $5 and make a dollar.
[01:24:24.033 --> 01:24:24.974]  Oh my gosh, I'm so evil.
[01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:31.558]  I mean, how am I supposed to... So we print... Most of our shirts are made in America.
[01:24:31.739 --> 01:24:32.999]  They're actually woven in America.
[01:24:33.039 --> 01:24:33.940]  The cotton's from America.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:35.081]  They're printed in America.
[01:24:36.553 --> 01:24:41.315]  I make special deals with people trying to drive the price down to maybe nine bucks in the U.S.
[01:24:42.556 --> 01:24:43.576]  Cotton's in the U.S.
[01:24:43.717 --> 01:24:44.517]  Ink's in the U.S.
[01:24:44.577 --> 01:24:45.577]  It's printed in the U.S.
[01:24:45.818 --> 01:24:47.278]  The trucks ship it in the U.S.
[01:24:47.698 --> 01:24:50.640]  It's $9.95 and I sell it for $5.
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.221]  Try that one on for size.
[01:24:53.481 --> 01:24:56.483]  But see, I've got other products where we make enough of a profit to do stuff like that.
[01:24:57.123 --> 01:24:57.923]  I'm just in a war.
[01:24:58.023 --> 01:25:00.265]  I wish I had a billion t-shirts saying Hillary for president.
[01:25:00.285 --> 01:25:00.865]  I'd give them away.
[01:25:02.065 --> 01:25:02.786]  What am I supposed to do?
[01:25:02.826 --> 01:25:03.426]  I'm all in.
[01:25:03.706 --> 01:25:04.927]  I'm firing everything I got.
[01:25:06.465 --> 01:25:07.905]  I'm set to not take any money in 2016.
[01:25:08.005 --> 01:25:10.226]  I don't even care.
[01:25:10.586 --> 01:25:13.987]  I'm just like, hire more people, more cameras, more crews, battle, battle, battle, battle!
[01:25:14.247 --> 01:25:17.068]  I am all in like the Alamo swinging my musket here.
[01:25:17.268 --> 01:25:22.089]  And all I'm saying is, if you have that attitude, there is nothing these globalists can do to stop us.
[01:25:22.309 --> 01:25:22.929]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:25:22.989 --> 01:25:23.469]  I'm all in.
[01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:23.910]  I'm all in.
[01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:24.950]  Because I have no birthright.
[01:25:25.170 --> 01:25:25.850]  I have no future.
[01:25:26.010 --> 01:25:27.691]  My kids have no future if we don't beat these people.
[01:25:28.811 --> 01:25:29.291]  I'm desperate.
[01:25:30.495 --> 01:25:36.661]  And what do one of the most famous, I forget his name, guys look up The Way of the Samurai is Desperate.
[01:25:36.681 --> 01:25:37.702]  I'm going to go to your calls, I'm sorry.
[01:25:38.623 --> 01:25:39.884]  The Way of the Samurai is Desperate.
[01:25:40.965 --> 01:25:45.950]  It's one of the most famous samurais and he said, The Way of the Samurai is Desperateness, not even 10 men.
[01:25:49.557 --> 01:25:52.800]  A hundred men can stop such a man, and in my life, I've actually found that.
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:57.123]  Most people are scared, they're timid, they're acting like they're tough, they're acting like they're bullying you.
[01:25:57.444 --> 01:26:03.829]  Now, when you take the gloves off and some thugs attack, and you actually start pounding the living hell out of them, they get down on the ground and start crying for mommy real fast.
[01:26:03.849 --> 01:26:06.451]  I don't care how big they are, because they're always the aggressor.
[01:26:07.372 --> 01:26:10.434]  The aggressor is a punk trying to get something for free.
[01:26:10.735 --> 01:26:11.835]  They don't have the spirit to win.
[01:26:11.855 --> 01:26:15.418]  I don't care that we have a hundred pounds more than me, and they're the state wrestling champion.
[01:26:15.619 --> 01:26:18.341]  They start the fight, they get the tracheotomy.
[01:26:19.977 --> 01:26:24.858]  And I'm just telling you right now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time to realize this spirit of weakness must be broken!
[01:26:25.239 --> 01:26:26.239]  And it is being broken!
[01:26:28.019 --> 01:26:29.180]  I can tell you, we've turned the tide.
[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:30.940]  We are going to win the war long-term.
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:32.801]  God already promised that, but you can see it.
[01:26:33.841 --> 01:26:35.081]  The empire's going to strike back.
[01:26:35.402 --> 01:26:36.242]  They don't know they've won.
[01:26:37.902 --> 01:26:39.123]  They don't know they've lost the battle.
[01:26:39.163 --> 01:26:40.183]  They don't understand that we've won.
[01:26:41.493 --> 01:26:42.494]  They're like Hitler and his bunker.
[01:26:42.834 --> 01:26:43.815]  So let's go ahead and finish up.
[01:26:43.855 --> 01:26:45.056]  Go to break with Nigel Farage.
[01:26:45.356 --> 01:26:51.121]  I promise I'm coming out of the gates with Trish and Donya and Brian and Trevor.
[01:26:51.141 --> 01:26:52.121]  Those are all first-time callers.
[01:26:52.182 --> 01:26:52.642]  And Steve.
[01:26:52.882 --> 01:26:54.643]  Then Scott, Sean and other folks.
[01:26:54.904 --> 01:26:57.406]  I said the first five callers will be first-time callers.
[01:26:57.446 --> 01:27:00.048]  And Andrew, Chris and so many others.
[01:27:00.468 --> 01:27:02.089]  Al and folks that are holding.
[01:27:02.972 --> 01:27:14.609]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, but this is the leader of the UKIP party from nowhere 25 years ago, running for office 20 years ago, and now the leader of Europe, the leader of opposition.
[01:27:14.649 --> 01:27:18.275]  He's a libertarian, he's a nationalist, he's a listener of the show, he's a patriot.
[01:27:19.670 --> 01:27:23.794]  Just like 1776, they're having their Declaration of Independence in the UK.
[01:27:24.335 --> 01:27:27.458]  You gotta hit bottom first before you come back up to the top, and they're now doing it.
[01:27:27.778 --> 01:27:31.202]  The UK's hit bottom, it's now coming back up to the top, and it's a beautiful thing.
[01:27:31.222 --> 01:27:33.164]  We'll go out to break with more of the UKIP leader.
[01:27:33.644 --> 01:27:36.967]  Westminster, SW1 and real communities.
[01:27:37.027 --> 01:27:54.139]  And the one image I will remember throughout the rest of my life was a woman in Bolton grabbing my hands with tears in her eyes saying, why doesn't David Cameron, why doesn't the government come and see what they've done to my community, what they've done to the prospects for my kids.
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:56.341]  People here don't understand.
[01:27:56.381 --> 01:27:57.082]  They're too wealthy.
[01:27:57.682 --> 01:28:10.289]  They don't get what open door mass immigration as a result of EU membership has done to people's wages, to people's availability of getting GP appointments or their kids into local schools.
[01:28:10.690 --> 01:28:13.891]  This was the issue ultimately that won this election.
[01:28:15.112 --> 01:28:16.912]  I'm thrilled that we've done this.
[01:28:17.893 --> 01:28:23.734]  I believe the other big effect of this election is not what's happened in Britain, but what will happen in the rest of Europe.
[01:28:24.214 --> 01:28:28.355]  I mean, in the rest of the EU, Eurosceptic parties never talked about leaving the EU.
[01:28:28.415 --> 01:28:29.055]  Now they are.
[01:28:29.595 --> 01:28:34.316]  An opinion poll of the Netherlands said that a majority there now want to leave.
[01:28:34.356 --> 01:28:37.797]  So we may well be close, perhaps, to an exit.
[01:28:38.717 --> 01:28:39.317]  That's right.
[01:28:39.357 --> 01:28:41.018]  The EU is collapsing.
[01:28:41.058 --> 01:28:42.198]  The EU is collapsing.
[01:28:42.238 --> 01:28:43.779]  We need Trump-Farage 2016.
[01:28:43.899 --> 01:28:46.259]  It's a global movement.
[01:28:46.439 --> 01:28:47.460]  It's 1776 worldwide.
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:48.540]  I coined the term.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.221]  It's now been adopted by UKIP, Lord Monckton and others, and is now happening.
[01:28:53.081 --> 01:28:56.862]  Not global government, but global awakening of liberty.
[01:28:57.182 --> 01:28:57.962]  1776 worldwide.
[01:28:58.623 --> 01:28:59.603]  It's unstoppable.
[01:29:09.485 --> 01:29:22.170]  This message is not just addressed to my fellow Americans, but addressed to people across the world of every race, color, and creed who believe in free speech, enshrined here in our republic as the First Amendment.
[01:29:22.851 --> 01:29:26.252]  It's the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights because it is the most important.
[01:29:26.272 --> 01:29:31.014]  The right to speak, the right to publish, the right to assemble, the right to petition, the right to...
[01:29:31.294 --> 01:29:35.235]  Practice your own religion and not having a state-run or authorized system.
[01:29:35.395 --> 01:29:44.659]  We have seen Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other media platforms increasingly censor even mainline libertarian and conservative ideas.
[01:29:44.959 --> 01:29:56.503]  Ladies and gentlemen, Facebook, if it's able to successfully get away with censoring a wide spectrum of ideas that the establishment doesn't agree with, not just conservatives, will set a mega massive precedent.
[01:29:57.023 --> 01:29:58.505]  Facebook's over a third of the internet.
[01:29:58.745 --> 01:29:59.185]  Think about that.
[01:29:59.686 --> 01:30:01.147]  Of the traffic and people visiting things.
[01:30:01.548 --> 01:30:02.168]  And then it's over.
[01:30:02.469 --> 01:30:06.773]  You think it's bad that communist China with a billion, 300 million people is censoring?
[01:30:07.614 --> 01:30:14.882]  Zuckerberg, who calls his users dumb effers, has been meeting with the Chinese censorship leadership, openly trying to tweak it.
[01:30:15.002 --> 01:30:15.883]  He met with Merkel.
[01:30:16.243 --> 01:30:19.885]  And openly, in a hot mic, said, don't worry, I'm going to start suppressing and censoring people.
[01:30:20.065 --> 01:30:24.507]  They report when someone criticizes open borders to the German government, and they come and arrest you.
[01:30:24.687 --> 01:30:28.669]  This is a global phenomenon that's taking place right now.
[01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:32.952]  They're passing laws in Canada to arrest people that criticize transgender.
[01:30:33.092 --> 01:30:34.292]  Well, that's your free speech!
[01:30:34.593 --> 01:30:37.034]  It's not hate propaganda, as they call it.
[01:30:37.354 --> 01:30:43.017]  If they set the precedent on these issues, they will basically ban any other type of speech that the global
[01:30:43.317 --> 01:30:43.798]  I think so.
[01:30:58.792 --> 01:31:05.056]  And when you post it on different platforms, that circumvents their AI systems that are trying to restrict the flow of information.
[01:31:05.196 --> 01:31:07.137]  We stand together or we hang separate.
[01:31:07.317 --> 01:31:12.180]  Another thing we're doing is not just battling to stop the censorship, we're also building other platforms.
[01:31:12.601 --> 01:31:20.466]  Getting on as many third-party systems as there are out there and spreading the word of basic free market liberty and human empowerment and the new renaissance.
[01:31:20.926 --> 01:31:24.168]  But also, the experts I've talked to said, Alex, you missed the boat.
[01:31:24.428 --> 01:31:27.489]  You're a pioneer in many ways, but you haven't promoted email.
[01:31:27.569 --> 01:31:29.870]  And I said, yeah, I don't ever really market on email.
[01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:31.791]  I just, I just, it's low tech.
[01:31:31.971 --> 01:31:34.312]  And they're like, no, no, no, that's what's going to be hard to censor.
[01:31:34.372 --> 01:31:47.498]  Even if the internet kill switch comes into place, there are systems and there are developments that make it very hard still to stop email and to stop that information being sent over networks, you name it.
[01:31:47.558 --> 01:31:48.979]  So it's essential.
[01:31:49.941 --> 01:32:01.186]  That everybody go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter to get exclusive articles, videos, promo code sometimes, the shopping cart like we had a few weeks ago with Hillary for prison, 50% off.
[01:32:01.506 --> 01:32:06.328]  I mean, there are some big discounts we send to incentivize people and plus you're some of the most hardcore patriots.
[01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:10.990]  You can send the email and the newsletter on with exclusive videos and articles many days.
[01:32:11.631 --> 01:32:12.591]  So that's another great reason.
[01:32:12.611 --> 01:32:16.233]  But overall, it's so that we have direct contact
[01:32:16.773 --> 01:32:30.747]  With fellow patriots out there around the world, and if they try to start shutting our websites down and other things, which they've tried to do, and kick us off Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, you name it, we'll be able to send you direct videos that you can then send on to others.
[01:32:31.387 --> 01:32:39.315]  We've all got to start thinking about the censorship and actively fighting it, getting more active and not taking independent liberty-based media for granted, which I know you don't do.
[01:32:40.536 --> 01:32:50.680]  But really having a sense of urgency and getting the info out more while building new avenues on cutting-edge tech and cutting-edge platforms, but also old tech like email.
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:58.322]  So please join hundreds of thousands of others that have been signing up every few months at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:32:58.663 --> 01:33:07.766]  And you can also spread the word about our free feeds and more podcasts, Android apps, iPhone apps, it's all free at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:33:13.837 --> 01:33:17.879]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.621 --> 01:33:33.386]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought.
[01:33:34.088 --> 01:33:36.649]  By the military industrial complex.
[01:33:37.009 --> 01:33:42.390]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[01:33:42.930 --> 01:33:48.132]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[01:33:48.992 --> 01:33:50.472]  It is a big idea.
[01:33:51.513 --> 01:33:52.593]  A new world order.
[01:33:55.634 --> 01:33:59.315]  It was almost as if there were planned implosions.
[01:33:59.515 --> 01:34:00.755]  It's just pancakes.
[01:34:03.081 --> 01:34:18.186]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:34:18.206 --> 01:34:25.649]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:30.880]  Guns will be taken.
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:31.901]  No one will be able to be off.
[01:34:32.041 --> 01:34:33.882]  We're going to take all of them.
[01:34:33.922 --> 01:34:38.665]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[01:34:38.725 --> 01:34:40.205]  Global governance at last.
[01:34:40.306 --> 01:34:41.246]  Is it one world?
[01:34:41.286 --> 01:34:42.907]  The central bank is in charge.
[01:34:42.967 --> 01:34:46.429]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:34:46.509 --> 01:34:50.531]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[01:34:52.852 --> 01:34:57.555]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:59.398 --> 01:35:01.961]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:35:02.001 --> 01:35:03.963]  Do I even need to tell folks that's Patrick Henry?
[01:35:04.784 --> 01:35:07.708]  Sometimes these quotes are so famous I don't want to tell you actually said them.
[01:35:08.128 --> 01:35:10.230]  Even though it's plagiarism, if I don't, what's the point?
[01:35:10.916 --> 01:35:12.656]  You know, it's like saying, you too, Brutus.
[01:35:12.736 --> 01:35:14.357]  You know, Julius Caesar said that.
[01:35:14.857 --> 01:35:16.157]  But yes, that was Patrick Henry.
[01:35:16.898 --> 01:35:20.458]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death, I want to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:35:20.638 --> 01:35:26.460]  It's just, it's an amazing time to be alive, where they admit a planetary corporate above the law government's being formed.
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:28.200]  Every world leader admits that.
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:29.681]  They have all these big treaties.
[01:35:29.701 --> 01:35:37.923]  And then if you point out, here, you said this on this TV show, or here's this document, or here's this global treaty, they go, can I have a tinfoil hat?
[01:35:39.875 --> 01:35:46.900]  And a great example of that was like six years ago, Gibbs, the press secretary was asked about a bunch of shows about the drone program.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:52.704]  It was a public program for years, predating Obama's administration, and he'd been told to say it doesn't exist.
[01:35:52.724 --> 01:35:56.227]  And he said, and I would go on TV and say something didn't exist that existed.
[01:35:58.028 --> 01:36:04.372]  And what was crazy is most of the times on CNN or Fox or anywhere, they would just agree with him and then say there is no drone program.
[01:36:08.335 --> 01:36:09.316]  I mean, think about that.
[01:36:10.526 --> 01:36:12.387]  That is quite a level of mind control.
[01:36:13.287 --> 01:36:17.309]  So I read... I mean, I saw over 50 articles this weekend.
[01:36:17.349 --> 01:36:19.390]  I didn't even read 4, 5, 6 of them, whatever.
[01:36:20.011 --> 01:36:21.892]  Just going, Alex Jones is insane.
[01:36:23.092 --> 01:36:25.113]  He believes the Brexit is tied to world government.
[01:36:25.133 --> 01:36:26.214]  New Yorker Magazine.
[01:36:27.475 --> 01:36:29.896]  And then I learned that's actually going to be in the print paper.
[01:36:30.896 --> 01:36:32.577]  Print... That's a pretty prestigious magazine.
[01:36:32.597 --> 01:36:34.498]  I mean, I've read some pretty good articles in there.
[01:36:35.298 --> 01:36:39.981]  It's like the level they've stooped to is just... I mean, the EU... I could play you...
[01:36:42.065 --> 01:36:56.650]  Five or six EU former heads or current heads, and I could play you two different, no no, three different British Prime Ministers admitting it's a world government project, saying, We will complete world government this year with the completion of the EU-Atlantic deal with the Americans.
[01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:59.191]  And the TPP in the next year.
[01:37:00.296 --> 01:37:01.597]  In fact, I'm going to go to calls.
[01:37:01.617 --> 01:37:04.039]  Will you guys just go to YouTube as a practice gesture?
[01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:05.640]  You folks can even watch us search.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:11.005]  We're not just on the radio, we're on TV too at Infowars.com forward slash show and TV and cable stations around the country.
[01:37:11.025 --> 01:37:13.647]  But anybody can go watch us at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:37:14.607 --> 01:37:19.591]  And just type in Herman Von Ruppe says EU establishing world government.
[01:37:19.611 --> 01:37:26.577]  And I can show you dozens of clips of him or Barroso or any of these guys.
[01:37:29.244 --> 01:37:32.686]  But you can just type in Herman Von Ruppe, World Government.
[01:37:32.726 --> 01:37:33.086]  Type that in.
[01:37:33.126 --> 01:37:34.227]  Herman Von Ruppe, World Government.
[01:37:35.067 --> 01:37:36.308]  And then you just, you have all the clips.
[01:37:36.588 --> 01:37:38.229]  And I told people the story like five, six years ago.
[01:37:38.249 --> 01:37:41.851]  Yeah, there's Nigel Farage confronts Herman Von Ruppe on World Government.
[01:37:41.871 --> 01:37:43.532]  Yeah, that's the clip right there at the top.
[01:37:44.032 --> 01:37:47.835]  And then it's on BBC with English subtitles and the English narrator.
[01:37:48.015 --> 01:37:49.215]  Here, let's just grab that.
[01:37:49.235 --> 01:37:50.176]  We'll play it after some calls.
[01:37:50.656 --> 01:37:51.837]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[01:37:52.157 --> 01:37:55.519]  And I had the anchor, the host of ABC Nightly News here,
[01:37:58.285 --> 01:37:59.366]  They were doing a Nightline piece.
[01:38:00.727 --> 01:38:02.488]  And he goes, there's no world government, you're making that up.
[01:38:02.568 --> 01:38:11.074]  And I went and showed him six clips of world leaders calling for world government and saying, we're establishing it.
[01:38:11.774 --> 01:38:17.338]  He looked at me and he said, that's a different world government than they're talking about.
[01:38:18.739 --> 01:38:19.780]  And he goes, hey, let's go to dinner.
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.482]  And at dinner, he just laughed and said, ha ha ha, I like your show.
[01:38:22.502 --> 01:38:23.523]  Yeah, I know, we all know this.
[01:38:23.883 --> 01:38:25.104]  We do our coverage, you do yours.
[01:38:25.124 --> 01:38:25.724]  Yeah, I get it.
[01:38:26.585 --> 01:38:27.826]  The guy was actually nice to me.
[01:38:29.585 --> 01:38:30.245]  What was his name?
[01:38:30.285 --> 01:38:31.046]  What's that guy's name?
[01:38:31.066 --> 01:38:33.167]  Because it's not that big a deal to be the ABC News anchor anymore.
[01:38:34.007 --> 01:38:34.488]  You've seen him.
[01:38:34.508 --> 01:38:36.409]  He used to be a 700 Club reporter before that.
[01:38:37.569 --> 01:38:37.929]  I don't know.
[01:38:38.009 --> 01:38:38.350]  Whatever.
[01:38:38.410 --> 01:38:41.291]  The point is, I literally don't know.
[01:38:41.591 --> 01:38:42.252]  I'm not even bragging.
[01:38:42.272 --> 01:38:45.273]  I want people to know that Hollywood has no power and TV has no power.
[01:38:45.994 --> 01:38:48.655]  I've hosted four different Discovery Channel shows.
[01:38:50.196 --> 01:38:50.476]  No, no.
[01:38:50.576 --> 01:38:57.940]  Three different Discovery Channel shows and four different History Channel shows in the last six, seven years, and I've never watched one of them.
[01:39:01.817 --> 01:39:02.137]  Not one.
[01:39:02.978 --> 01:39:03.438]  Not one.
[01:39:03.538 --> 01:39:04.919]  I could care less about that.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:13.686]  That's an enemy transmission, and I just put my info out, whatever they do, and then I go over here, and I just have these pure transmissions where I can really talk to you.
[01:39:14.626 --> 01:39:15.887]  But it's not like some power trip.
[01:39:15.947 --> 01:39:16.588]  I'm on TV.
[01:39:17.008 --> 01:39:18.869]  I'm embarrassed I even did those interviews.
[01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:22.812]  Now I get calls, and I go, you know what, Vice?
[01:39:23.112 --> 01:39:24.153]  Vice wanted to come here and do an interview.
[01:39:24.193 --> 01:39:24.874]  I just said, you know what?
[01:39:25.974 --> 01:39:26.675]  I'm just not going to do it.
[01:39:27.873 --> 01:39:28.954]  Oh, HBO you want to interview?
[01:39:29.034 --> 01:39:29.714]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:39:30.035 --> 01:39:31.936]  Oh, you want me to be in a movie with Christian Bale?
[01:39:32.016 --> 01:39:33.257]  You know what, I'm just not going to do it, okay?
[01:39:33.977 --> 01:39:36.039]  Go jump in a frickin' freezing lake.
[01:39:36.579 --> 01:39:37.140]  How's that feel?
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.321]  In fact, let's go to DrudgeReport.com right now.
[01:39:39.641 --> 01:39:40.962]  You know what I want to be associated with?
[01:39:41.002 --> 01:39:45.766]  People like Matt Drudge, who actually have courage and care about freedom, and are fighting for internet freedom and free speech.
[01:39:46.046 --> 01:39:46.366]  Look at this.
[01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:48.268]  Look, look, Drudge gets how big it is.
[01:39:48.528 --> 01:39:49.929]  Let's blow that up so I can read that.
[01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:51.390]  Globalists rattled.
[01:39:51.790 --> 01:39:52.710]  World government in trouble.
[01:39:52.730 --> 01:39:55.512]  Here, let's blow up the top left-hand corner headlines.
[01:39:55.552 --> 01:39:57.272]  I want to read those out to folks if we can.
[01:39:57.712 --> 01:40:00.414]  Because my computer's down here, so I have to go off the TV screen.
[01:40:03.235 --> 01:40:03.515]  Trump.
[01:40:03.615 --> 01:40:05.276]  Independence wave coming.
[01:40:08.497 --> 01:40:12.038]  What you guys can do is you can minimize the browser, make it a little bit smaller, and then I can read that.
[01:40:12.359 --> 01:40:13.719]  Oh, Drudge is one of the oldest websites.
[01:40:13.739 --> 01:40:14.079]  No, I know.
[01:40:14.099 --> 01:40:14.820]  That's why I love it.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:15.460]  What's old is new.
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.860]  Shadow over Hillary.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:20.602]  Open revolt against encrusted establishment.
[01:40:22.082 --> 01:40:28.043]  And it just goes on and on about how Soros calls for reconstruction after he loots it.
[01:40:28.603 --> 01:40:31.504]  Support for Spain's Conservative Party surges days after Brexit.
[01:40:32.044 --> 01:40:34.425]  I mean, just look, it's total revolt against world government.
[01:40:34.745 --> 01:40:36.145]  Everyone's saying world government.
[01:40:36.505 --> 01:40:38.145]  Everyone's saying planetary tyranny.
[01:40:38.505 --> 01:40:39.966]  Everyone's saying New World Order.
[01:40:40.446 --> 01:40:41.206]  Ah, you failed!
[01:40:41.246 --> 01:40:41.966]  Your hoax failed!
[01:40:42.006 --> 01:40:42.886]  It's all out in the open.
[01:40:43.146 --> 01:40:43.707]  I'm so happy.
[01:40:43.747 --> 01:40:44.447]  Okay, let's go to calls.
[01:40:44.827 --> 01:40:48.888]  Donna, Trish, Ryan, Trevor, Steve, Zeb, Ryan, you name it.
[01:40:49.668 --> 01:40:50.028]  Donna?
[01:40:50.968 --> 01:40:53.569]  Or Donya, calling from Corpus Christi, Texas.
[01:40:53.609 --> 01:40:54.589]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:40:54.609 --> 01:40:54.929]  Go ahead.
[01:40:56.490 --> 01:40:56.950]  Hi.
[01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:58.210]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:40:58.290 --> 01:40:58.930]  I'm doing good.
[01:40:59.270 --> 01:41:00.011]  How may I serve you?
[01:41:00.031 --> 01:41:00.951]  What's on your mind today?
[01:41:01.571 --> 01:41:01.691]  Ah!
[01:41:01.711 --> 01:41:02.391]  We're alive!
[01:41:02.411 --> 01:41:04.972]  That's right.
[01:41:05.412 --> 01:41:10.574]  First, I want to say thank you for the amazing product, amazing news, and the inspiration.
[01:41:10.594 --> 01:41:11.214]  I have to say that.
[01:41:11.254 --> 01:41:12.354]  I've been listening for a few years.
[01:41:12.394 --> 01:41:13.835]  Well, thank you for your inspiration, ma'am.
[01:41:14.035 --> 01:41:14.455]  Your support.
[01:41:15.897 --> 01:41:20.518]  And, um, it's just, you know, it's a European and it's an American renaissance.
[01:41:20.759 --> 01:41:22.579]  I think they're both working in tandem.
[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:31.622]  Um, our histories have been intertwined for hundreds of years, so it's not a surprising factor that one continent affects the other.
[01:41:33.162 --> 01:41:36.763]  And, you know, this, this is radicalizing the left.
[01:41:37.664 --> 01:41:44.586]  And all I have to say is we have to stick to the headlines and repeat them because that's what these people are used to.
[01:41:46.307 --> 01:41:53.944]  I've learned that stooping into the details and trying to explain it with sources and the history behind it all just gets a lot of folks lost.
[01:41:55.764 --> 01:41:57.346]  And, you know... I agree with you.
[01:41:57.426 --> 01:42:03.654]  I mean, once people are awake, it's great to give the whole history of it, but how do you reach out to somebody that's literally, like Helen Keller, not aware what planet they're on?
[01:42:03.974 --> 01:42:05.336]  I like to say, you've been conned.
[01:42:05.356 --> 01:42:05.936]  You've been hoaxed.
[01:42:06.016 --> 01:42:06.777]  I care about you.
[01:42:07.098 --> 01:42:08.740]  I'm not telling you this to act elitist.
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:10.622]  I used to be uninformed.
[01:42:10.642 --> 01:42:12.104]  I used to be in this cocoon.
[01:42:12.184 --> 01:42:13.685]  Let me teach you about this scam.
[01:42:13.986 --> 01:42:15.608]  It could really empower you to be aware.
[01:42:17.171 --> 01:42:19.052]  It's, you know, it's externalism.
[01:42:19.512 --> 01:42:25.074]  It goes beyond foreign policy of converting countries to so-called democracies around the world.
[01:42:25.514 --> 01:42:29.436]  We've been under a policy of externalism for decades now.
[01:42:30.396 --> 01:42:35.358]  And finally people are waking up and they're realizing there's this big elephant in the room.
[01:42:35.438 --> 01:42:36.178]  That's a great point.
[01:42:36.198 --> 01:42:42.321]  The media has been bought and paid for, and as a class have been the real deceivers, enabling this giant lie and this fraud.
[01:42:42.381 --> 01:42:43.501]  Thank you so much, Donna.
[01:42:43.961 --> 01:42:44.442]  Great points.
[01:42:45.402 --> 01:42:51.528]  I'm going to write to you that Brian, Trevor, Steve, Zeb, Ryan, then Scottish John, Andrew, I'm going to everybody.
[01:42:51.708 --> 01:42:52.789]  Each person gets a minute though.
[01:42:53.049 --> 01:42:56.592]  Don't ask me a question because I'm going to you to make your statement and I'm moving to the next person.
[01:42:56.632 --> 01:43:04.540]  So just get up there to the gate, get up there on the starting line and get ready for that green light and those flags and start waving because we're about to start this sucker.
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:07.803]  I'm sorry I didn't get to more calls but tomorrow we will during the weekday transmission.
[01:43:10.113 --> 01:43:16.278]  In 1969, Bill Clinton was expelled from Oxford for raping 19-year-old Eileen Wellstone.

[01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:36.654]  Find out in The Clinton's War on Women.
[01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:41.507]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:44:41.567 --> 01:44:44.669]  Today, Donald Trump made an announcement on his website.
[01:44:44.749 --> 01:44:49.231]  Donald J. Trump's statement regarding British referendum on EU membership.
[01:44:49.271 --> 01:44:53.793]  The people of the United Kingdom have exercised the sacred right of all free peoples.
[01:44:53.933 --> 01:45:01.757]  They've declared their independence from the European Union and have voted to reassert control over their own politics, borders, and economy.
[01:45:01.857 --> 01:45:08.941]  A Trump administration pledges to strengthen our ties with a free and independent Britain, deepening our bonds in commerce.
[01:45:09.161 --> 01:45:10.601]  Culture and mutual defense.
[01:45:10.781 --> 01:45:19.304]  The whole world is more peaceful and stable when our two countries and our two peoples are united together, as they will be under a Trump administration.
[01:45:19.444 --> 01:45:24.766]  Come November, the American people will have the chance to re-declare their independence.
[01:45:24.986 --> 01:45:28.967]  They will have the chance to reject today's rule by the global elite.
[01:45:29.227 --> 01:45:30.747]  I hope America is watching.
[01:45:30.908 --> 01:45:34.329]  It will soon be time to believe in America again.
[01:45:34.529 --> 01:45:35.769]  I couldn't have said it better.
[01:45:36.049 --> 01:45:38.610]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:46.777]  In 1993, Hillary Clinton ordered Vince Foster's dead body to be moved and dumped to avoid a murder investigation.

[01:46:12.593 --> 01:46:21.436]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[01:46:21.716 --> 01:46:30.301]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:46:30.541 --> 01:46:37.446]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigerex herbal processing technique.
[01:46:37.586 --> 01:46:42.909]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best
[01:46:43.169 --> 01:46:46.570]  In 1969, Bill Clinton was expelled from Oxford for raping 19-year-old Eileen Wellstone.
[01:46:46.650 --> 01:46:48.690]  Read about this and every one of his crimes against women.
[01:46:48.850 --> 01:46:49.791]  The Clintons' War on Women.
[01:46:49.811 --> 01:46:50.431]  In stores now.
[01:47:13.399 --> 01:47:19.583]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.344 --> 01:47:24.046]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[01:47:24.106 --> 01:47:27.388]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[01:47:27.508 --> 01:47:29.009]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[01:47:29.529 --> 01:47:31.890]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[01:47:32.651 --> 01:47:35.513]  Somewhere along the way.
[01:47:35.533 --> 01:47:38.835]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:47:42.352 --> 01:47:43.592]  Thank you, George Strait, for introducing us.
[01:47:44.192 --> 01:47:48.793]  Hard to turn that voice off, but we're going to do it right now and go to Steve, Veb, Trish, and everybody else.
[01:47:49.333 --> 01:47:51.374]  Steve calling from Austin, Texas.
[01:47:51.814 --> 01:47:53.114]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:47:53.134 --> 01:47:53.694]  Thanks for holding.
[01:47:57.175 --> 01:47:57.355]  Good.
[01:47:57.395 --> 01:47:57.935]  Welcome, sir.
[01:47:57.975 --> 01:47:58.495]  You're on the air.
[01:47:58.875 --> 01:47:59.196]  Thank you.
[01:47:59.696 --> 01:48:00.756]  All right.
[01:48:00.876 --> 01:48:03.716]  This is the moment I've been waiting for with regard to Brexit.
[01:48:04.237 --> 01:48:10.798]  This is the moment where the fight between those who want to be free and the globalists is starting to
[01:48:11.902 --> 01:48:24.050]  Well, they've always been able to say there is no EU, it's not a dictatorship, it doesn't exist.
[01:48:24.370 --> 01:48:33.856]  So now we're making them admit it does, as the EU tries to ban free speech, as they try to merge with us, they try to merge with the TPP, and so we're now going to have a debate and they're going to lose.
[01:48:34.057 --> 01:48:37.479]  That's why they're going to run scams, but we can't lose hope because the debate's here.
[01:48:38.803 --> 01:48:40.124]  Yeah, and it's incredible.
[01:48:40.184 --> 01:48:59.314]  I've been waiting for this for a very long time, I've been listening to you for a long time, been reading a lot of this paraphernalia for a long time, and so just to be able to have it on the public stage and be able to point at it and say, hey, this is going on, and just give them little fact toys that break down their whole trendy argument is just really exhilarating.
[01:49:00.603 --> 01:49:01.244]  It is, my friend.
[01:49:01.264 --> 01:49:02.324]  What do you expect next?
[01:49:02.384 --> 01:49:04.726]  I mean, some people are going to say, oh, Alex, it's not that big of a victory.
[01:49:04.746 --> 01:49:05.687]  They're going to keep fighting us.
[01:49:05.707 --> 01:49:06.488]  Well, of course they are.
[01:49:06.528 --> 01:49:14.914]  But now we've openly pointed out it's a dictatorship created by a bunch of weird Nazis and British royalty at the end of World War II.
[01:49:14.974 --> 01:49:19.498]  I mean, I mean, the EU is literally Spectre out of a James Bond movie.
[01:49:20.953 --> 01:49:25.497]  What I expect next is definitely, you know, those hand-in-hand.
[01:49:25.537 --> 01:49:27.339]  It's like a yin and yang, like a seesaw.
[01:49:27.399 --> 01:49:31.462]  If something gets messed up in Europe, they're going to try something in America.
[01:49:31.582 --> 01:49:35.486]  It's a collective attack on humanity, and people need to start understanding that.
[01:49:35.946 --> 01:49:42.252]  Because Obama doing the immigration thing over here, it's like, okay, Brexit didn't work, let's do the immigration thing over here.
[01:49:42.272 --> 01:49:44.394]  If that didn't work, okay, let's do this over here.
[01:49:44.494 --> 01:49:45.815]  It's a collective attack.
[01:49:46.175 --> 01:49:50.840]  That's going to continue, but as long as we remain vigilant, I don't think that's really going to work.
[01:50:01.052 --> 01:50:04.453]  We knew Hitler was going to lose, but it was still going to be a hard fight because he wasn't going to give up.
[01:50:04.753 --> 01:50:06.914]  I think we've reached that magic moment in my gut.
[01:50:07.194 --> 01:50:08.094]  It's a long battle.
[01:50:08.295 --> 01:50:09.355]  There'll still be problems.
[01:50:09.555 --> 01:50:10.936]  There's no utopia at the end of it.
[01:50:11.136 --> 01:50:14.257]  But this world government project is in deep you-know-what.
[01:50:14.337 --> 01:50:14.917]  God bless you.
[01:50:15.117 --> 01:50:15.657]  Great points.
[01:50:16.337 --> 01:50:17.038]  Let's go ahead.
[01:50:17.098 --> 01:50:19.759]  Speaking of economic collapse, I think that may be their next move.
[01:50:20.159 --> 01:50:22.159]  Let's talk to Trevor and then Webb.
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:22.940]  Trevor.
[01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:24.581]  Alex, it's an honor.
[01:50:24.601 --> 01:50:28.483]  I just wanted to bring up the stock market crash that's hiding in plain view.
[01:50:28.503 --> 01:50:32.726]  If I could ask someone to pull up the yahoofinance.com and then go to the S&P 500 index
[01:50:55.137 --> 01:50:58.599]  We'll do that, but just for everybody, they can go to the S&P Index anywhere.
[01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:00.781]  So just look at the S&P Index.
[01:51:00.801 --> 01:51:01.801]  Now, what's your view on that?
[01:51:02.242 --> 01:51:04.303]  You can already see globally, it was already crashing before.
[01:51:04.563 --> 01:51:06.965]  They're blaming what's happening last week with Brexit on that.
[01:51:08.086 --> 01:51:23.796]  Right, and if you pull up to the max view, which not very many people do, you'll see the first peak in 2000, which is the bubble, the dot-com bubble, and then we see the other peak, which is the mortgage bubble, and then
[01:51:24.827 --> 01:51:30.508]  You look at the current bubble that we're in, and really there's nowhere else for us to go.
[01:51:30.568 --> 01:51:41.771]  I mean, the S&P 500 is the index that... Yes, if you look at those mountains, this is the mother of all bubbles, and it's set to start going down, and then they're going to try to blame the Brexit and Donald Trump.
[01:51:41.891 --> 01:51:42.691]  I don't think it's going to work.
[01:51:43.111 --> 01:51:48.693]  It's Donald Trump and the Brexit and nationalism and true free market, not crony garbage, that's going to pull us out of this.
[01:51:48.893 --> 01:51:51.553]  We know socialism isn't going to work like Venezuela, huh?
[01:51:52.554 --> 01:51:53.074]  Absolutely.
[01:51:53.794 --> 01:51:54.274]  And really,
[01:51:55.685 --> 01:51:59.368]  My word, what's on my heart, is to warn people to prepare.
[01:51:59.568 --> 01:52:05.773]  I mean, like you said, that's the next domino, or the tool that they have to really trip on us.
[01:52:05.873 --> 01:52:08.255]  So, that's really my point.
[01:52:09.807 --> 01:52:10.327]  Well, you're right.
[01:52:10.387 --> 01:52:16.111]  And George Soros, while he helped build the euro, is now saying they should reconstitute the euro on the ashes of what's about to collapse.
[01:52:16.551 --> 01:52:20.173]  No, we're not going to have the folks that engineered this start it up again.
[01:52:20.273 --> 01:52:22.815]  You guys are going to be anathema and hated.
[01:52:23.135 --> 01:52:23.976]  Incredible point.
[01:52:24.036 --> 01:52:24.996]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:52:25.397 --> 01:52:26.017]  Thank you, Trevor.
[01:52:26.737 --> 01:52:27.038]  Let's go.
[01:52:27.098 --> 01:52:27.818]  I wish I had more time.
[01:52:27.838 --> 01:52:29.019]  These callers are much better than I am.
[01:52:29.059 --> 01:52:31.560]  Tomorrow, I promise, we're going to take a mass ton of calls.
[01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:33.101]  In fact, I may even cancel guests tomorrow.
[01:52:33.642 --> 01:52:34.522]  Let's go to Vebb.
[01:52:34.802 --> 01:52:36.003]  First time caller in Illinois.
[01:52:36.023 --> 01:52:36.584]  You're on the air.
[01:52:36.624 --> 01:52:36.904]  Welcome.
[01:52:38.454 --> 01:52:40.636]  Hi, I'm going to try and be as quick as I can about this.
[01:52:41.016 --> 01:52:51.586]  It has to do with, um, I've just been seeing what's been going on in Jamaica, uh, for a few years now and just how misinformed they are about what's been happening in America.
[01:52:52.326 --> 01:52:59.553]  And they don't even know what's happening here, but yet they want to talk about it like, like they do.
[01:52:59.633 --> 01:53:04.137]  And what I've noticed is how informed they are with Donald Trump.
[01:53:04.157 --> 01:53:05.338]  They don't know anything.
[01:53:06.377 --> 01:53:07.038]  About what's going on.
[01:53:07.078 --> 01:53:10.620]  They just go by what, I guess, MSNBC has to say about it.
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:14.644]  Sure, well it's easy when you're in another country to kind of believe the propaganda because that's all you have.
[01:53:14.664 --> 01:53:15.364]  You're not in the country.
[01:53:15.404 --> 01:53:19.728]  But, oh yeah, in Europe, he's still popular there because, you know, they want to be loving.
[01:53:19.768 --> 01:53:20.528]  They want to be liberal.
[01:53:20.568 --> 01:53:22.410]  They want to be, they just buy into the hype.
[01:53:24.011 --> 01:53:27.574]  The thing, you see, the reggae community is very huge in Europe.
[01:53:28.454 --> 01:53:35.360]  And then when you have people from Jamaica that bring that influence towards Europe, you're going to have a lot of people that are
[01:53:35.993 --> 01:53:36.814]  We're good to go.
[01:53:55.307 --> 01:53:57.647]  Well, look, folks kind of jump on a bandwagon.
[01:53:57.687 --> 01:54:02.548]  What they don't get is, if you're going to do that, you've got to create the bandwagon and be ahead of the trend.
[01:54:02.768 --> 01:54:04.649]  You don't catch the wave after it already breaks.
[01:54:05.209 --> 01:54:08.409]  But all these trendies just always think that's the way to go, and it's sickening.
[01:54:08.689 --> 01:54:09.449]  Great points, though.
[01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:10.850]  Let's go ahead.
[01:54:10.890 --> 01:54:13.030]  It's not just Jamaica where folks think Obama's God.
[01:54:13.410 --> 01:54:15.230]  Anywhere you're not under it, you think it's wonderful.
[01:54:16.111 --> 01:54:19.551]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian.
[01:54:20.011 --> 01:54:22.332]  Brian's a truck driver on the road.
[01:54:22.532 --> 01:54:23.232]  You're on the air.
[01:54:23.272 --> 01:54:23.772]  Welcome, sir.
[01:54:25.523 --> 01:54:25.983]  How you doing?
[01:54:26.043 --> 01:54:29.925]  Yeah, I'm a Trump supporter, young black male, truck driver.
[01:54:30.425 --> 01:54:42.990]  Um, called us on CNN today and the Traditionalist Workers Party was trying to hold a rally in Sacramento, California in front of the Capitol building protesting the government.
[01:54:43.090 --> 01:54:48.012]  And, uh, they were attacked by a group of, uh, so-called anti-fascists.
[01:54:49.092 --> 01:54:50.873]  And, uh, the first thing the news said is, uh,
[01:54:52.136 --> 01:55:02.812]  It's a white, white, white wing extremist group, KKK, and started shooting all kind of blasphemy at these guys and their platform says nothing about being white supremacist.
[01:55:08.334 --> 01:55:18.256]  You know, I saw CNN, just briefly before I went on air, with POTOC, who's the little pointed head of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a foreign organization basically, saying right-wingers knife attack.
[01:55:18.296 --> 01:55:24.657]  And to be honest, I got so busy on Brexit and the open borders, I've got the articles here, it's conflicting.
[01:55:25.157 --> 01:55:26.517]  What are they saying really happened now?
[01:55:28.378 --> 01:55:36.299]  Well, they're saying that the workers' party stabbed the other group of guys and
[01:55:37.338 --> 01:55:43.661]  And they are all extremists, right wing extremists and KKK and white supremacy.
[01:55:43.741 --> 01:55:48.784]  Sure, sure, so that's what the articles admit, that it was the communists that stabbed the Trump type people.
[01:55:50.565 --> 01:55:56.167]  But when I was watching CNN, I literally watched one minute of it during a break, and they were acting like the right wing did it.
[01:55:56.187 --> 01:55:57.288]  I mean, that is so crazy.
[01:55:59.718 --> 01:56:01.340]  That's a bunch of propaganda, man.
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:02.440]  They keep pushing that.
[01:56:03.201 --> 01:56:04.422]  They keep pushing that crap.
[01:56:21.554 --> 01:56:22.995]  Truck drivers, would you say, are pro-Trump?
[01:56:23.555 --> 01:56:25.717]  And then how many black folks you know are really pro-Trump?
[01:56:25.757 --> 01:56:27.017]  Some numbers are 25%.
[01:56:27.298 --> 01:56:27.938]  Some numbers are 10%.
[01:56:28.779 --> 01:56:29.899]  I don't know what polls to believe.
[01:56:29.919 --> 01:56:30.460]  What do you think?
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:38.284]  Well, the majority of truck drivers I've talked to on the road at truck stops are pro-Trump or anti-Hillary.
[01:56:39.025 --> 01:56:45.809]  But when I get back home to Jackson, Michigan, most of the black guys I know, they don't want to think for themselves.
[01:56:45.829 --> 01:56:46.770]  They're lazy-minded.
[01:56:47.779 --> 01:56:52.824]  They just believe whatever CNN tells them, so they think Trump's a racist and all this crap.
[01:56:52.864 --> 01:56:53.565]  That's incredible.
[01:56:53.605 --> 01:56:57.569]  Hillary stole more than half the money to Haitian refugees, but that's nothing compared to Bono.
[01:56:57.929 --> 01:56:58.289]  He stole 99%.
[01:56:58.810 --> 01:57:03.615]  And then it's like, it's okay because you said you love me, but you robbed me.
[01:57:03.915 --> 01:57:08.720]  Imagine if Trump had taken, it was like 55% of what Hillary took.
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:11.403]  55% of the money she just took for Haitians with Bill.
[01:57:12.253 --> 01:57:14.715]  And it's like, can you imagine if Trump did that?
[01:57:14.835 --> 01:57:16.717]  I mean, it is just like, it is crazy.
[01:57:16.737 --> 01:57:17.537]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:57:17.557 --> 01:57:18.118]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:19.218 --> 01:57:23.522]  I apologize to Scottis, John, Ryan, Al, Tricia, Andrew, and Chris.
[01:57:23.542 --> 01:57:24.683]  In fact, I'll actually do this.
[01:57:26.351 --> 01:57:31.013]  If you want to give us your number in there with our great crew, we got a limited crew on Sundays, but we'll write it down.
[01:57:31.293 --> 01:57:32.873]  We'll call you back during the show tomorrow.
[01:57:32.913 --> 01:57:34.374]  I want to hear every caller today.
[01:57:34.394 --> 01:57:35.034]  It was awesome!
[01:57:35.674 --> 01:57:36.354]  Awesome callers!
[01:57:36.394 --> 01:57:37.275]  Thank you so much!
[01:57:37.655 --> 01:57:38.315]  Thanks for putting up with me.
[01:57:38.335 --> 01:57:39.575]  I should have gone to you at the start of the hour.
[01:57:39.975 --> 01:57:41.796]  But I'm going to look at the schedule of big guests tomorrow.
[01:57:41.836 --> 01:57:47.178]  I think I'm going to move some guests or cut some guests because people are fiery, they're awake, and I love the different angles.
[01:57:47.498 --> 01:57:48.218]  Folks, take us in.
[01:57:48.238 --> 01:57:49.258]  So tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:57:49.278 --> 01:57:54.320]  Central, InfoWars.com, forward slash show to find all the free feeds, iPhone and Droid apps and more.
