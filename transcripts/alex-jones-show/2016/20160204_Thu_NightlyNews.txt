[00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:21.386]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:26.648]  I'm your host, Rob Due, and today's date is Thursday, February 4th, 2016, and here's a look at what's coming up.
[00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.492]  Tonight, how Planned Parenthood tried to hide its baby parts profits.
[00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:40.034]  Then, updates on the Zika virus.
[00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:45.376]  And Rob Due's exclusive interview with presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.
[00:00:45.877 --> 00:00:46.557]  That's next.
[00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:51.182]  Well, we're going to talk about how... how Hillary Clinton...
[00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:55.898]  Took all the votes that I had worked extremely hard for.
[00:00:55.918 --> 00:01:01.740]  And the people at the Iowa Caucus took what I worked for and gave it to her.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.063]  And I have a huge problem with that because I worked really hard on getting those votes from me.
[00:01:08.743 --> 00:01:11.525]  Because we need a socialist in the White House.
[00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:17.187]  And I don't think it's right when you take something from someone who's worked hard for it.
[00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:01.624]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.206]  You can't survive without it.
[00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.308]  But where do you get it?
[00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:10.375]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:16.302]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:33.360]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.881]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:36.242 --> 00:02:37.442]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:37.722 --> 00:02:38.503]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:38.743 --> 00:02:39.363]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:39.664 --> 00:02:41.485]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:03:03.988 --> 00:03:08.229]  Top story on Infowars.com and the Drudge Report from the Washington Examiner.
[00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.650]  Border agent, we might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether.
[00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.770]  In a shocking reversal of policy, U.S.
[00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.472]  Customs and Border Protection agents are being told to release illegal immigrants and no longer order them to appear at deportation hearings.
[00:03:19.872 --> 00:03:23.673]  Essentially a license to stay in the United States, a key agent testified Thursday.
[00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:27.854]  That key agent was Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council.
[00:03:28.114 --> 00:03:31.335]  And he actually said we might as well abolish our immigration laws altogether.
[00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:39.436]  Now, this new change in policy was prompted by the Obama administration's embarrassment that only half of the illegals were showing up to their deportation hearings.
[00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:42.477]  So they didn't even care that they were being told to show up for court.
[00:03:42.757 --> 00:03:43.617]  They weren't doing it.
[00:03:43.917 --> 00:03:46.298]  And we've got two stories that we're going to play back from the vault.
[00:03:46.578 --> 00:03:47.138]  These are both from 2014.
[00:03:47.298 --> 00:03:50.698]  This is when we were sending our crews down to the border, showing U.S.
[00:03:51.058 --> 00:03:55.299]  Border Patrol paying people to put them on buses and ship them across the United States.
[00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:59.260]  And then what happens when Americans go through these internal checkpoints.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.220]  So stay tuned for that.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.301]  Moving on, to the Tribune Express, a woman barred from entering Starbucks in Saudi Arabia.
[00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:12.382]  And a woman reportedly barred from entry after a gender separation wall ordered by authorities collapsed.
[00:04:12.762 --> 00:04:22.884]  Now according to Cosmopolitan, Starbucks issued a statement explaining their action, saying, Starbucks in Saudi Arabia adheres to the local customs by providing separate entrances for families as well as single people.
[00:04:23.344 --> 00:04:28.425]  Our stores provide equal amenities, service menu and seating to men and families, the statement read.
[00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:33.647]  So you go to a different country, they have certain customs, they're respected.
[00:04:34.047 --> 00:04:36.748]  But here in our country, you're not allowed to have any customs.
[00:04:36.768 --> 00:04:44.930]  You're not allowed to have anything but basically dilute yourself to everybody else's customs and we have to be like sat upon by vultures.
[00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:47.411]  So it's really disgusting and there's just another example of that.
[00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:48.972]  Now on to some energy news.
[00:04:49.432 --> 00:04:55.376]  Nuclear fusion device first test with hydrogen declared a success, and this is out of Germany, from the Associated Press.
[00:04:55.896 --> 00:05:03.641]  Scientists in Germany flipped the switch Wednesday on an experiment they hope will advance the quest for nuclear fusion, considered a clean and safe form of nuclear power.
[00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:15.948]  Following nine years of construction and testing, researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Greifswald injected a tiny amount of hydrogen into a donut-shaped device, then zapped it with the equivalent of 6,000 microwave ovens.
[00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:18.710]  And what does that mean for you and I?
[00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.051]  Because they're saying this technology is about 10 years away from actually becoming...
[00:05:33.516 --> 00:05:34.917]  You know, commonplace.
[00:05:35.577 --> 00:05:42.100]  This type of technology will be, I guess, submarined by big, giant corporations who want to maintain their control.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.002]  And not that I'm for or against fossil fuels.
[00:05:45.022 --> 00:05:45.902]  We need them right now.
[00:05:46.162 --> 00:05:51.685]  We totally need them, especially coal, because it's a cheap form of gasoline or a cheap form of electricity.
[00:05:52.245 --> 00:06:09.104]  But what we do need is stuff like this to come out more and to get more funding so we can move beyond the fossil fuel generation and start moving into the 22nd century and having plasma engines, interstellar space travel, all that stuff will come with this type of technology.
[00:06:09.164 --> 00:06:10.545]  So let's see what happens.
[00:06:11.286 --> 00:06:15.368]  Well, here's another version of how technology is going to be really bad and controlling for you.
[00:06:15.388 --> 00:06:15.708]  Here it is.
[00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:19.869]  Google expands self-driving car testing to Washington State.
[00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:20.910]  Alphabet Inc.
[00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:29.253]  said Wednesday its self-driving car project will expand testing to Kirkland, Washington, later this month, the third city where it is testing autonomous vehicles.
[00:06:29.733 --> 00:06:38.436]  The company's Google unit has conducted autonomous vehicle testing for six years in Mountain View, California, where it is based, and it just expanded to Austin, Texas, over the summer.
[00:06:39.196 --> 00:06:54.402]  And pretty soon they're going to be popping up in a neighborhood near you and David Knight did the calculations like you're going to have 80 to 90 more accidents per lifetime of a driver if you were to base it just on the few years that Google has been testing its cars and how many accidents they've already gotten into.
[00:06:55.382 --> 00:06:55.762]  Here we go.
[00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:57.885]  This is a big story out of Breitbart.
[00:06:57.925 --> 00:07:02.930]  Video shows Planned Parenthood executive sought to hide profits from baby part sales.
[00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:11.879]  A new video released by the Center for Medical Progress appears to show Planned Parenthood uses accounting gimmicks to hide profits created through the sale of body parts of aborted babies.
[00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:17.865]  And we're going to have a couple videos on this and Liam Mackey is going to be joining me to discuss these videos.
[00:07:17.905 --> 00:07:19.106]  So let's go to that first one right now.
[00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:23.729]  Based on what I'm reading here, I think it's paying for the specimen itself.
[00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.852]  Right, on paper it's gotta be massaged a little.
[00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:36.834]  Yes, how we say that, how we frame it, I think is important too.
[00:07:36.934 --> 00:07:48.419]  Even if the procedure itself, there's a modification in how they do it, it's still the same procedure, but we're doing it in a way that we preserve the integrity of the specimen.
[00:07:49.315 --> 00:07:53.862]  And on video, that was Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast Director of Research, Melissa Farrell.
[00:07:54.603 --> 00:07:56.987]  And with reaction on that is Leanne McAdoo.
[00:07:57.288 --> 00:07:59.231]  Leanne, what do you think of that fuzzy math that they use?
[00:07:59.537 --> 00:08:18.514]  Well, it's just deeply disturbing how many times, how many videos have to come out where they're admitting on camera that they're using accounting gimmicks, that they can't wait to get a Lamborghini with all of the profits that they're raking in through the sale of this fetal tissue, and talking about how they're actually changing it in their accounting books to cover this up.
[00:08:19.055 --> 00:08:20.957]  And, you know, she even kind of whispers it.
[00:08:20.977 --> 00:08:22.278]  Because she knows she's guilty.
[00:08:22.438 --> 00:08:25.319]  Right, that's a telltale sign of, oh, I don't want anyone hearing this.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:32.503]  But, you know, they didn't do anything wrong, and in fact, it's these undercover journalists, investigators, who are the ones who've been involved.
[00:08:32.623 --> 00:08:32.963]  That's right.
[00:08:33.043 --> 00:08:36.505]  Expose corruption, become a whistleblower, and you get attacked.
[00:08:36.905 --> 00:08:38.526]  That's what we've been seeing ever since.
[00:08:38.946 --> 00:08:42.908]  Who came into office and said they were going to protect whistleblowers, be the most transparent administration?
[00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:43.688]  Obama.
[00:08:43.708 --> 00:08:44.389]  So this is what you get.
[00:08:44.749 --> 00:08:48.450]  Let's go to that second clip now, and boy, there's just more.
[00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.431]  It just keeps coming and coming.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.821]  Because we had two levels of invoicing for them.
[00:08:55.902 --> 00:09:02.564]  We had it worded as per consent, because the consent process was the administrative part that we had to do.
[00:09:02.764 --> 00:09:11.447]  So they know, okay, yes, you're covering costs, there's margin, it's covering overhead or whatever we need to make sure that everything is covered.
[00:09:11.847 --> 00:09:14.988]  And so when we're coming in and making it
[00:09:15.675 --> 00:09:16.256]  I think so.
[00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:31.230]  So there you have it Leanne.
[00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.791]  Human life to these people is what?
[00:09:32.811 --> 00:09:33.591]  Just a line item.
[00:09:33.611 --> 00:09:34.292]  Just a line item.
[00:09:34.332 --> 00:09:38.014]  Just a line item or a possible future Lamborghini to these people.
[00:09:38.135 --> 00:09:39.555]  Yeah, it's deeply disturbing.
[00:09:39.856 --> 00:09:42.377]  Representative Marsha Blackburn out of Tennessee said this,
[00:09:50.703 --> 00:10:02.628]  The Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives is examining these issues and this new video once again raises more questions about the medical procedures and business practices used by entities involved in fetal tissue procurement.
[00:10:02.988 --> 00:10:07.369]  Our panel intends to follow these facts where they lead us, but what seems to happen?
[00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.211]  It just seems to happen that the people who are exposing this seem to be the only ones getting in trouble.
[00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:13.692]  Right, well Planned Parenthood has friends in high places.
[00:10:13.712 --> 00:10:16.133]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.474]  I mean, Hillary Clinton's already said, I'm backing you all the way.
[00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:25.296]  Cecile Richards' daughter is one of her campaign managers, you know, as she's running for president.
[00:10:25.336 --> 00:10:28.117]  So they don't want this to fall.
[00:10:28.177 --> 00:10:30.918]  They do not want this baby factory to fall.
[00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:31.981]  You know,
[00:10:50.871 --> 00:11:03.076]  Planned Parenthood whistleblower, she said that they make some, she was being very mild saying that they would make at minimum $6,000 a week and probably up to $30,000 a week.
[00:11:03.296 --> 00:11:09.118]  So this is something that each clinic, I mean, it's a massive amount of profit that they're making.
[00:11:09.498 --> 00:11:17.261]  So then Planned Parenthood says, oh, you know, we're not doing anything wrong, but we're going to go ahead and stop getting any money for this fetal tissue, right?
[00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:19.082]  Well, what about Stem Express?
[00:11:19.642 --> 00:11:29.431]  You know, David DeLeden and his other journalists there, they have been indicted with tampering government records as well as purchasing human organs.
[00:11:29.812 --> 00:11:32.714]  But StemXpress, which is one of these... It's okay for them to do it.
[00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:43.365]  Yeah, they say, join the StemXpress partner program that fiscally rewards clinics or promotes global biomedical research while also providing a financial benefit to your clinic.
[00:11:43.945 --> 00:11:47.966]  So, and they point out right there, you're going to be contributing to the fiscal growth of your clinic.
[00:11:47.986 --> 00:11:49.307]  So what about STEM Express?
[00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:50.487]  What about Planned Parenthood?
[00:11:50.887 --> 00:11:56.349]  Why are they trying to silence the First Amendment and go after journalists and going undercover?
[00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:59.630]  This is a vital part of the First Amendment.
[00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.491]  It's a big tool.
[00:12:00.691 --> 00:12:04.832]  People do it all the time because you're not going to get a true answer from somebody if you come up and ask them a true question.
[00:12:05.272 --> 00:12:07.233]  They're just going to hide away from it.
[00:12:07.253 --> 00:12:09.794]  They're going to shield themselves in the cloak of secrecy.
[00:12:10.074 --> 00:12:12.536]  Right, and so that's not just us saying this.
[00:12:12.596 --> 00:12:16.079]  Now we have actually some pro-choice law professors who are coming out.
[00:12:16.359 --> 00:12:20.482]  They're calling this legal jujitsu over the baby parts video maker.
[00:12:20.542 --> 00:12:23.204]  They say it's deeply disturbing for journalists, actually.
[00:12:24.525 --> 00:12:39.276]  And they go on to say of all the different things that have been found out from going undercover, so that the CBS 60 Minutes, they talk about tonight, with the help of hidden camera footage, we're going to show you how easy it is to conceal questionable funds from law enforcement.
[00:12:39.796 --> 00:12:44.897]  Or there's another person who posed as a slave buyer to expose the evils of slavery.
[00:12:44.918 --> 00:12:50.479]  And they do it all the time on programs like To Catch a Predator, where they set up hidden camera stings.
[00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:51.659]  Those people don't get sued.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:52.860]  Right.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.100]  And they're doing a public service.
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.941]  When you do a public service, you should be rewarded.
[00:12:57.441 --> 00:12:58.902]  I totally, I totally think this.
[00:12:59.062 --> 00:13:19.052]  This is something that is going to set a major precedent, just saying that, you know, animal rights activists or anyone who's a whistleblower, if you have to go and get a fake ID in order to say, you know, to get access, there are so many places that you're not going to be able to get access to if you're not willing to use the tools of an undercover investigator.
[00:13:19.372 --> 00:13:25.499]  And now with this Zika virus going crazy, we have pregnant Zika victims will be given access to abortions at sea.
[00:13:25.959 --> 00:13:32.506]  So because they're outlawed in South America, they're just going to be bringing women onto boats, giving them abortions because of this.
[00:13:32.907 --> 00:13:35.169]  Who knows what it is going on, this bioweapon.
[00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.373]  We have no idea what's going on with the Zika virus.
[00:13:38.533 --> 00:13:51.317]  And now they think this Zika virus is going to doom the Summer Olympics because you've got people coming from all over the world, they're going to catch it, bring it back to their places, plus you have all the sex going on with the athletes and with the people coming in, legal prostitution, whatever.
[00:13:51.337 --> 00:13:52.598]  Yes, total breeding ground.
[00:13:52.918 --> 00:13:58.400]  And of course, what's really interesting is that they're kind of tying in this microcephaly
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.321]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:14:21.681 --> 00:14:23.082]  Of course, they want to stay away from that.
[00:14:23.102 --> 00:14:24.443]  And I want to bring up a guest.
[00:14:24.543 --> 00:14:25.704]  This is Laura Adams.
[00:14:25.784 --> 00:14:28.586]  She is a single mother to a six-year-old boy who was vaccine injured.
[00:14:28.926 --> 00:14:30.007]  And what is she doing to fight back?
[00:14:30.428 --> 00:14:32.609]  She is having an event, and I want to promote her event.
[00:14:32.729 --> 00:14:41.476]  It doesn't have any followers on it right now, so I want people out there, especially in the Ohio area, to get involved with this, because the only way to get involved is to get off the couch and get involved.
[00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:42.917]  So, Laura, how are you doing today?
[00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:45.211]  I'm doing fine.
[00:14:45.231 --> 00:14:52.795]  A little bit stressed because I'm trying to talk to you guys and like I warned you before, you're probably going to be hearing a lot of noises from my son in the background.
[00:14:53.035 --> 00:14:53.735]  Well, that's all right.
[00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:54.816]  I mean, this is real life.
[00:14:54.836 --> 00:14:57.477]  We're not dealing with teleprompter reading puppets here.
[00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.759]  So your event's called Educating Dayton the Truth About Vaccines.
[00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:02.179]  Tell me about some of the people who are going to be there.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.222]  Well, I've got several panel members so far.
[00:15:06.262 --> 00:15:10.124]  I'm calling them panel members because we're going to set the event up kind of
[00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:22.524]  Where I'm going to have tables set up and I'm bringing together several of the most brilliant minds that I know to Dayton to share everything that they've learned.
[00:15:22.584 --> 00:15:25.865]  We've got a physician who treats autism.
[00:15:26.045 --> 00:15:31.708]  I've got a former government scientist.
[00:15:32.488 --> 00:15:39.191]  Two authors of books regarding vaccines and the dangers of vaccines.
[00:15:40.217 --> 00:15:45.579]  And I did just create the page earlier today because I just finalized on a date.
[00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:48.361]  It is going to be Saturday, April 16th at 4 p.m.
[00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:52.402]  I'm waiting on confirmation back for our venue.
[00:15:53.803 --> 00:15:57.384]  We're partnered with a great organization, the Thinking Moms Revolution.
[00:16:00.786 --> 00:16:03.207]  The whole goal of this for me and
[00:16:03.908 --> 00:16:16.453]  I hesitated to even put the word vaccine in the title because so many people, as soon as they see that word, they think it's a bunch of anti-vaxxers who are crazy and they stray away.
[00:16:16.593 --> 00:16:18.873]  Well, that is not what this event is about.
[00:16:18.933 --> 00:16:21.334]  We are not saying don't vaccinate your children.
[00:16:21.374 --> 00:16:22.615]  We're not telling you what to do.
[00:16:23.155 --> 00:16:23.715]  Sorry about that.
[00:16:25.576 --> 00:16:27.437]  That's not our right to tell anybody what to do.
[00:16:29.352 --> 00:16:32.296]  What we're saying is to do your research.
[00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:34.860]  And we've done a lot of that for you.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.823]  So we want to share that with everyone.
[00:16:37.244 --> 00:16:44.114]  Yeah, I think one of the biggest things people could do is just read the insert and read the different other side effects that they mention that they don't tell you at the doctor's office.
[00:16:44.134 --> 00:16:45.696]  They just say, hey, safe and effective.
[00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:52.502]  And aluminum is in so many, and that's one of the neurotoxins that it crosses the blood-brain barrier.
[00:16:53.222 --> 00:17:00.287]  I myself, I have to get B12 shots, and last time I went in to get a shot, for the first time ever, I said, can I see the insert?
[00:17:00.948 --> 00:17:02.829]  There's aluminum in it, you know?
[00:17:02.989 --> 00:17:13.197]  And knowing what happened to my son, my perfectly healthy son, knowing that he was vaccine injured and became severely autistic within a week or two of his MMR,
[00:17:14.315 --> 00:17:27.362]  And then knowing everything with the whistleblower, the CDC whistleblower that's come out where I think it was like a 342% increased risk for black males, my son being biracial, you know, it just.
[00:17:28.564 --> 00:17:31.807]  The CDC is responsible for the struggle that we go through.
[00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:35.270]  And they don't want to take any responsibility for this.
[00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:41.655]  They want, especially the vaccine companies, they just want to bypass everything and run it through the federal government where you go to this vaccine court.
[00:17:42.015 --> 00:17:43.997]  I'm going to mention some of the panel members.
[00:17:44.017 --> 00:17:44.978]  You got Amanda Royal.
[00:17:45.918 --> 00:17:51.702]  Natalie Renee Steffen, Irene Pye, Tyler Dam, Elliott Freed, Dr. Judy Mikovits.
[00:17:52.323 --> 00:17:54.524]  And plus, you're going to be looking at getting more people on there.
[00:17:54.564 --> 00:18:04.931]  I'd like to see everybody in the Ohio area, especially the Dayton area, get out there and bring more attention to vaccine-injured children because this is the big issue.
[00:18:05.011 --> 00:18:08.674]  And they're trying to create these health pandemics to get people to take more vaccines.
[00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:12.436]  And man, at the end of the day, more vaccines does not equal better health.
[00:18:13.377 --> 00:18:13.477]  No.
[00:18:14.206 --> 00:18:14.686]  It does not.
[00:18:14.786 --> 00:18:23.749]  It equals thousands and thousands of children that are injured and we're left with struggle the rest of our lives.
[00:18:24.009 --> 00:18:24.769]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[00:18:24.989 --> 00:18:26.149]  Well, thanks Laura for coming on.
[00:18:26.169 --> 00:18:27.330]  We're going to promote your event.
[00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.990]  We'll see about covering it in the future.
[00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:29.911]  It's going to be in April.
[00:18:30.231 --> 00:18:33.612]  I'll put all the information here in the YouTube description below.
[00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:37.893]  And we'll be right back with a special message from Alex Jones and Bernie Sanders.
[00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:13.659]  Look, I don't know what your problem is, but I simply cannot have students wandering the hallways during class, interrupting other classes, and giving prophecies of a great plague!
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.882]  We believe in win-win, folks.
[00:19:15.922 --> 00:19:17.664]  Treating people like we want to be treated.
[00:19:17.884 --> 00:19:22.449]  That's why we developed NutraCyticals with Dr. Group and other top researchers, chemists, scientists, you name it.
[00:19:22.589 --> 00:19:23.550]  He's one of our advisors.
[00:19:23.811 --> 00:19:29.297]  To come up with products like AnthroPlex that is an original product that he made just for us.
[00:19:30.218 --> 00:19:32.080]  And this is a base
[00:19:33.121 --> 00:19:33.961]  We're good to go.
[00:19:59.352 --> 00:19:59.992]  It'll sell out.
[00:20:00.312 --> 00:20:11.116]  So, Infowarslife.com, Anthroplex, 15% off and free shipping for the next two days only when you get it with Supermail or Female Vitality.
[00:20:11.216 --> 00:20:12.017]  Let's go to Dr. Group.
[00:20:12.197 --> 00:20:18.039]  Why do you call this the foundation to start the fire and then the Supermail takes you to the next level?
[00:20:19.264 --> 00:20:43.468]  Well, we just look at the base problem that's going on right now all over the world, which is the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the amount of estrogen that men have, the femininity of men, and what's going on even in children right now with low testosterone levels, low sperm count levels, and the problems that, and the attack that we're seeing on the endocrine systems of both male and female.
[00:20:43.968 --> 00:20:53.015]  So I'm always looking for ways to boost that and to make it more effective and naturally get the body to start producing these hormones and balancing themselves.
[00:20:53.816 --> 00:21:03.903]  So what we decided to do is how can we add a few other components in there that would actually boost the effectiveness of the super male vitality and at the same time
[00:21:04.864 --> 00:21:06.925]  What is in the goat weed?
[00:21:07.005 --> 00:21:09.786]  You've got one of the purest, strongest organic forms of it.
[00:21:09.806 --> 00:21:11.067]  What's so magic about the goat weed?
[00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:37.132]  Well, the horny goat weed was given that name because years ago in India, they noticed that a certain time of the year, this weed would grow and the goats would eat it and they would just go crazy with all the female goats.
[00:21:37.232 --> 00:21:38.734]  So that's how it was developed.
[00:21:38.774 --> 00:21:39.695]  It's called epimidium.
[00:21:40.496 --> 00:21:47.202]  And what that's been proven to do over thousands of years is increase sexual pleasure, help balance the male hormones.
[00:21:47.242 --> 00:21:48.984]  It can actually be used for women as well.
[00:21:49.424 --> 00:21:56.310]  But it really kind of resets and brings the hormone balance, improves sperm motility, and increases testosterone levels.
[00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.312]  So it counters the stuff they've been throwing at us.
[00:21:58.572 --> 00:22:00.154]  Results will vary overall.
[00:22:00.594 --> 00:22:02.396]  All I know is dynamite.
[00:22:02.856 --> 00:22:07.681]  I mean, absolutely dynamite with stamina, with the weight lifting, with the swimming.
[00:22:07.921 --> 00:22:09.282]  Folks, the new product is available.
[00:22:09.863 --> 00:22:12.925]  AnthroPlex, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:13.306 --> 00:22:15.428]  Dr. Group, thank you for developing this amazing product.
[00:22:15.588 --> 00:22:15.888]  Thank you.
[00:23:12.202 --> 00:23:17.650]  Let me show in a parable to what extent our nature is enlightened.
[00:23:18.849 --> 00:23:19.969]  Or unenlightened.
[00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.170]  Uh, Bernie Sanders.
[00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.331]  Uh, female.
[00:23:25.471 --> 00:23:26.191]  White power.
[00:23:26.731 --> 00:23:30.693]  Envision human figures living in an underground cave.
[00:23:31.373 --> 00:23:34.074]  Yeah, I don't really follow politics, really.
[00:23:34.134 --> 00:23:44.737]  Here they've been from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning their heads around.
[00:23:54.145 --> 00:24:03.433]  Plato, one of the most famous Greek philosophers and historians in world history, famously had his allegory of the cave.
[00:24:04.173 --> 00:24:05.254]  If you're brought up in a box,
[00:24:06.434 --> 00:24:11.556]  Like some of these young women we've heard about who were kidnapped at birth and lived in a trailer until they were 15 years old.
[00:24:12.377 --> 00:24:16.898]  You believe that the confines of that box is the universe and is that world.
[00:24:17.739 --> 00:24:26.222]  And your captor that comes in to feed you a few times a day and rape you or whatever the case may be, you think that's your father, your mother figure, your God figure.
[00:24:26.542 --> 00:24:27.843]  That's everybody to you.
[00:24:29.063 --> 00:24:32.245]  And that's why I'm shooting this here in this twilight with just one light above me.
[00:24:33.115 --> 00:24:42.871]  Is to illustrate visually, not just with facts and statistics, that we are being kept in the dark, and no one more so than Bernie Sanders supporters.
[00:24:43.848 --> 00:24:45.629]  This is not a pitch for Hillary or anybody else.
[00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:47.530]  The point is, you're really being kept at the door.
[00:24:47.670 --> 00:25:03.697]  What Bernie Sanders is engaged in has been funded for over 150 years by European royalty, the aristocracy, as well as the new robber baron class that was forming in the last 150 years, to scapegoat free market as the problem.
[00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:25.569]  And to sell communism and socialism and wealth redistribution as a solution when the elites themselves are international in scope, largely exempt from the taxes like Google and General Electric and Warren Buffett today, who calls for higher taxes on the middle class that he calls the rich, but is the biggest recipient, of course, of the 2008 banker bailout.
[00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:27.650]  So this is how this scam works.
[00:25:27.691 --> 00:25:29.852]  The ultra-rich going after the middle class.
[00:25:30.372 --> 00:25:32.353]  So when Sanders says the 1% is the enemy,
[00:25:34.144 --> 00:25:38.347]  Well, 90% of the 1% hardly have any of the wealth.
[00:25:39.187 --> 00:25:54.797]  When you do the math of 7.5 billion people in the world and 6,000 elite managers and owners, according to the Kissinger Group and the book, Superclass, written by Rothkopf, the elite themselves say there's 6,000 that own and rule half the wealth of the world.
[00:25:55.017 --> 00:25:56.938]  And that's back when that book was written eight years ago.
[00:25:57.519 --> 00:25:59.280]  It's closer to 60% of the wealth now.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.042]  And so they're desperate to scapegoat the middle class for what they've done.
[00:26:03.823 --> 00:26:07.666]  As if Bernie Sanders is greedy and bad because he has $600,000.
[00:26:07.786 --> 00:26:11.028]  Or, you know, makes a quarter million a year as a senator.
[00:26:11.508 --> 00:26:14.030]  No, he buys houses, he buys cars, he buys services.
[00:26:14.551 --> 00:26:17.133]  It's that middle class and upper middle class that funds everything.
[00:26:17.893 --> 00:26:19.894]  But I want to show you the math, and it varies.
[00:26:19.914 --> 00:26:21.334]  You know, there's some estimates that U.S.
[00:26:21.394 --> 00:26:26.776]  wealth is close to 90 trillion, public, private, you name it.
[00:26:27.236 --> 00:26:34.759]  Some estimates as much as 250 billion globally in real assets, government and private, including charities.
[00:26:34.999 --> 00:26:40.060]  But if you look at the derivatives, 2.2 is what our own government says they believe there is worldwide.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.101]  Quadrillion.
[00:26:41.641 --> 00:26:41.901]  That's
[00:26:43.366 --> 00:26:45.548]  2,200 trillion and growing.
[00:26:46.028 --> 00:26:47.269]  It's derivatives, it's fake.
[00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:50.271]  Only Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and a few others own it.
[00:26:50.811 --> 00:26:53.893]  Only they've been allowed, the mega banks, to engage in such crimes.
[00:26:54.374 --> 00:26:58.797]  The same ones that fix the stock market, fix the interest rates, fix the currency rates.
[00:26:59.257 --> 00:27:06.122]  So let's come out of Plato's Cave and look, not at the 1% that's our enemy, but the point after the 1%.
[00:27:07.063 --> 00:27:07.523]  This is of the 1%.
[00:27:08.384 --> 00:27:11.306]  The point, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[00:27:12.026 --> 00:27:16.211]  It's been a while since I did this, so we're going to see what the latest numbers are when we crunch and we've got some of them pulled up.
[00:27:16.431 --> 00:27:17.472]  So let's come out of the cave.
[00:27:18.633 --> 00:27:22.457]  And again, we're not offering all the answers in the universe as we come out of the cave, as Plato said.
[00:27:22.737 --> 00:27:26.962]  There are other mysteries once you come out, and other truths, and other things to discover.
[00:27:26.982 --> 00:27:29.024]  It's just one more box we've transcended.
[00:27:29.685 --> 00:27:32.928]  But we've got Josh Owens here with some of this pulled up from establishment sources.
[00:27:33.969 --> 00:27:35.550]  CNN, how close are you to the top 1%?
[00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.911]  Then they'll say it's between a quarter million to four hundred thousand dollars.
[00:27:38.971 --> 00:27:40.332]  They debate which is the 1%.
[00:27:41.412 --> 00:27:49.156]  But if you're making that a year as a household, both people two hundred and something thousand dollars, then you're the evil 1%, okay?
[00:27:49.596 --> 00:27:57.940]  But if you, and I guess you've had time to do this now, divide seven and a half billion people into six thousand that they admit have more than half the wealth, let's just say half,
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.124]  We come up with an astounding number.
[00:28:01.925 --> 00:28:04.589]  So now we have this number. 0.0000008421.
[00:28:10.996 --> 00:28:13.657]  So that's the ultra elite.
[00:28:13.678 --> 00:28:15.278]  They always say 1% has half the wealth.
[00:28:15.338 --> 00:28:15.579]  No, no.
[00:28:16.339 --> 00:28:20.561]  It is that tiny 6,000 that has more than half the wealth.
[00:28:20.881 --> 00:28:28.606]  If you actually do the math, which we've done, and actually look at the rest of the 1% or even the 2%, you could take the wealth
[00:28:29.666 --> 00:28:36.751]  Of the bottom 2%, all of that first point and most of the second point, and it wouldn't run the U.S.
[00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:37.572]  for even a year or two.
[00:28:37.952 --> 00:28:38.593]  Now, the U.S.
[00:28:38.613 --> 00:28:41.294]  has a $19 trillion debt as of Monday.
[00:28:42.335 --> 00:28:45.978]  It's now Thursday going into Friday here on the Nightly News.
[00:28:46.698 --> 00:28:47.439]  So think about that.
[00:28:48.139 --> 00:28:48.680]  Think about that.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.443]  You're being told the 1% is the enemy all day when it's that very elite that's telling you that they're the problem.
[00:28:53.623 --> 00:28:55.264]  We're not saying Bernie's this evil guy because he's 1%.
[00:28:56.983 --> 00:29:00.425]  And of course the little socialists go, that's cause you're one of the one of the one percent.
[00:29:00.845 --> 00:29:02.465]  It's the dumbest argument I've ever seen.
[00:29:02.485 --> 00:29:04.326]  Do you know what socialism and communism delivers?
[00:29:04.566 --> 00:29:05.107]  Hell on earth.
[00:29:05.407 --> 00:29:06.867]  Bernie Sanders for sure, probably.
[00:29:07.268 --> 00:29:09.489]  So you're feeling the Bern, any particular reason?
[00:29:09.589 --> 00:29:13.270]  Probably as a student, all of his policies about tuition free college.
[00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:14.791]  Tuition free college.
[00:29:15.231 --> 00:29:16.091]  Free college.
[00:29:17.092 --> 00:29:19.573]  I don't know if it'll be possible, but it works for me.
[00:29:20.193 --> 00:29:21.694]  Who would pay for the free tuition?
[00:29:22.757 --> 00:29:24.419]  Hopefully the rich people of America.
[00:29:24.439 --> 00:29:28.142]  I mean, this is the most gang mentality dumbed down.
[00:29:28.182 --> 00:29:29.624]  It's like, we want to elect Hitler.
[00:29:29.644 --> 00:29:31.666]  He says he'll invade France and give us free stuff.
[00:29:32.106 --> 00:29:36.551]  I mean, this is a paradical, conquest-borne system that we're now in.
[00:29:37.091 --> 00:29:39.113]  Alex Jones reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:29:39.534 --> 00:29:40.675]  Are you still inside the cave?
[00:29:43.439 --> 00:29:52.324]  So that was Alex Jones breaking down who the true elite are in this world, and also exposing that Bernie Sanders is part of the 1%, not that there's anything wrong with that.
[00:29:52.364 --> 00:29:58.628]  But now we have, right before he goes and debates Hillary Clinton tonight in their first head-to-head, Bernie Sanders is now joining us.
[00:29:58.648 --> 00:29:59.608]  Bernie, how are you doing today?
[00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:08.694]  Well, hey, we released your statement today and how pissed off you were that somebody actually stole something from you that you really worked on hard.
[00:30:09.074 --> 00:30:10.935]  How do you really feel about these cheaters out there?
[00:30:11.503 --> 00:30:19.385]  Oh, I remember when I used to be a principal and these students would hijack the computers and go to websites like this.
[00:30:21.185 --> 00:30:26.487]  Hey, what about that one?
[00:30:26.587 --> 00:30:28.647]  Oh no, that one's illegal Hank.
[00:30:28.667 --> 00:30:30.588]  Come on, I wanna see it, I wanna see it!
[00:30:30.628 --> 00:30:32.388]  Yeah, come on Stewart, do it.
[00:30:51.598 --> 00:30:55.302]  Wow, that is tragic, especially when people learn the real truth about socialism, Bernie.
[00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:56.544]  Now, let me ask you this.
[00:30:56.804 --> 00:30:59.367]  You lost Iowa over six coin tosses.
[00:30:59.628 --> 00:31:01.310]  What do you expect from Hillary Clinton tonight?
[00:31:02.113 --> 00:31:04.415]  Well, she's already up to the same dirty tricks.
[00:31:04.795 --> 00:31:06.277]  I can't even find my car.
[00:31:07.258 --> 00:31:14.404]  Alex Jones told me to be safe here, but I guarantee you, if said Hillary Clinton, she's already up to it again.
[00:31:14.424 --> 00:31:18.247]  Doesn't want me to show up and push the socialist agenda.
[00:31:20.598 --> 00:31:29.802]  Bernie, I see you have in your bunker a homage to Vladimir Lenin, and you've publicly stated you're going from yes we can to yes we will.
[00:31:30.202 --> 00:31:35.325]  How much are you going to take from the American people to redistribute to people who don't want to really work?
[00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.812]  Well, first off, let's do a simple equation.
[00:31:39.653 --> 00:31:43.196]  One million plus one million equals free.
[00:31:44.277 --> 00:31:46.219]  That's the whole plan, you know.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.845]  Just like they redistributed my votes in Iowa to that Hillary Clinton.
[00:31:52.265 --> 00:31:56.229]  That's what we're going to do with the one percent that I definitely have nothing to do with.
[00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:57.811]  That's right.
[00:31:57.991 --> 00:32:01.976]  I think it's funny that you're just being, you're a victim of your own success.
[00:32:02.317 --> 00:32:07.584]  You're sitting here touting how great socialism is, and then when it comes after you and bites you in the butt, you really don't like it, do you?
[00:32:07.924 --> 00:32:09.306]  Well, I'll give you the last word.
[00:32:09.346 --> 00:32:10.888]  What do you have to say to the American people?
[00:32:11.469 --> 00:32:12.049]  It burns!
[00:32:14.873 --> 00:32:25.461]  Well good luck Bernie, I hope you do beat the witch Hillary Clinton, but I don't think you stand a chance in hell in getting the presidency because once people really see what's behind your plan, they are going to stand up.
[00:32:25.801 --> 00:32:31.865]  Now let's go to your message that you sent to Hillary Clinton and we broadcasted exclusively here at InfoWars earlier today.
[00:32:32.085 --> 00:32:32.686]  Yes we will!
[00:32:46.075 --> 00:32:48.641]  This is an American president.
[00:32:48.982 --> 00:32:52.770]  Just add puppet, then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:17.355]  This is Bernie Sanders and I'm quite upset.
[00:33:17.555 --> 00:33:24.298]  If you guys saw the Iowa Caucus the other night, you would know that I worked extremely hard for these votes.
[00:33:24.598 --> 00:33:30.761]  And the people that were working in the Iowa Caucus took what I worked hard for and gave it to someone else.
[00:33:31.081 --> 00:33:36.063]  A lying, cheating, horrible human being by the name of Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:38.244 --> 00:33:42.146]  I don't understand how anybody could like something like this.
[00:33:42.226 --> 00:33:54.492]  That you work hard for something your whole life and you earn something and then you're expected to give it to someone else who's not as deserving and is too lazy or more of a piece of crap than you are.
[00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:57.613]  What kind of person would even think about something like that?
[00:33:57.873 --> 00:34:01.235]  Hey, that'd be you, Bernie Sanders.
[00:34:01.475 --> 00:34:02.536]  Guess you just felt the Bern.
[00:34:03.656 --> 00:34:06.657]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:06.858 --> 00:34:07.478]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.301]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:34:14.641 --> 00:34:18.184]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:34:18.444 --> 00:34:21.067]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:34:21.387 --> 00:34:24.830]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.734]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts.
[00:34:28.854 --> 00:34:29.174]  I'm good.
[00:34:53.069 --> 00:34:54.110]  We're good to go.
[00:35:12.617 --> 00:35:18.719]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:35:18.759 --> 00:35:20.020]  The police are shoving people.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:20.860]  Shoving Alex.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.041]  Shoving the crowd.
[00:35:22.061 --> 00:35:22.861]  Here we go, folks.
[00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:23.801]  I'm being assaulted.
[00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:30.104]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:35:30.204 --> 00:35:36.106]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:40.028]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:43.169]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:51.292]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:35:51.573 --> 00:35:53.613]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:35:53.673 --> 00:35:54.714]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:35:55.054 --> 00:36:03.822]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.362]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[00:36:34.502 --> 00:36:36.603]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.

[00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:45.109]  So,
[00:37:06.144 --> 00:37:15.630]  Earlier in the show, we talked about a Washington Examiner article where the head border agent of the Border Patrol Council said, we might as well abolish our national immigration laws altogether.
[00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:21.594]  And I want to play two videos that we produced back in 2014 during the summer.
[00:37:22.214 --> 00:37:26.077]  First one is called US Border Patrol paying to ship illegals deep into the US.
[00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:32.641]  Back as far as two years ago, we were exposing this as a total operation by the Obama administration.
[00:37:32.681 --> 00:37:34.222]  Here's some excerpts of that first video.
[00:37:34.949 --> 00:37:43.911]  Well what happened today in particular is that the Border Patrol dropped off some, they call them detainees, but obviously they're not detained after they drop them off.
[00:37:44.491 --> 00:37:49.172]  And normally they have tickets or arranged transportation to go somewhere in the interior.
[00:37:49.732 --> 00:37:57.714]  Well today, apparently for some logistical reasons, some of them hadn't had transportation arranged or their transportation is tomorrow.
[00:37:57.734 --> 00:37:57.914]  Right.
[00:37:58.314 --> 00:38:01.075]  And so we're having to find places to shelter them.
[00:38:01.775 --> 00:38:02.395]  For tonight.
[00:38:02.475 --> 00:38:05.117]  So we've accessed some resources that we have.
[00:38:05.137 --> 00:38:06.178]  We're going to shelter them here tonight.
[00:38:06.878 --> 00:38:08.819]  So why is the Border Patrol bringing them here?
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.601]  They're not bringing them here.
[00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:18.145]  They're bringing them to our bus terminal because that's where the Border Patrol understands that they have transportation to go to the interior.
[00:38:18.605 --> 00:38:18.806]  Right.
[00:38:18.826 --> 00:38:19.866]  So they're dropping them off.
[00:38:19.926 --> 00:38:24.069]  It's our understanding that they were dropped off with tickets or with vouchers for tickets.
[00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:34.175]  Turns out some of them didn't tonight, didn't have their ticket, or didn't have their voucher, or like I said, their bus isn't till tomorrow, so they've got nowhere to stay.
[00:38:34.596 --> 00:38:42.401]  Our bus terminal by ours, I mean the City of McAllen, bus terminal is not a 24-7 operation, so we've got to put them up somewhere else.
[00:38:42.561 --> 00:38:51.927]  So for tonight, we're doing the best we can with this resource, which thankfully one of our neighboring cities made available to us, and we're going to put them up here.
[00:38:51.947 --> 00:38:54.829]  Tomorrow we'll have a little chat with the Port of Patrol and see what's going on.
[00:38:55.816 --> 00:38:58.097]  And we've produced countless other videos.
[00:38:58.117 --> 00:39:03.118]  We showed that the gates are being left open in El Paso, the drug shipments that are coming in.
[00:39:03.138 --> 00:39:06.219]  We showed that, how it happens live on video.
[00:39:06.259 --> 00:39:06.799]  We have that.
[00:39:07.279 --> 00:39:11.480]  And just the ranchers that we've interviewed that are totally being devastated by this invasion.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.180]  And now I want to go to another video.
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.781]  This is what happens to Americans.
[00:39:15.001 --> 00:39:19.162]  This is how they're treated when they're driving 90 miles from the border.
[00:39:20.774 --> 00:39:25.798]  Joe Biggs, we're at a border security checkpoint right now.
[00:39:25.838 --> 00:39:27.439]  Getting ready to go through.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.543]  And what they're going to ask us is if we're American citizens.
[00:39:31.623 --> 00:39:32.984]  And we aren't going to say anything.
[00:39:33.044 --> 00:39:39.849]  Instead, we're going to play the funniest clips of Alex Jones over the radio.
[00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:41.351]  And we're going to see what happens.
[00:39:41.371 --> 00:39:44.653]  We're going to see how these Border Patrol agents react to this.
[00:39:45.734 --> 00:39:46.135]  Stand by.
[00:39:53.147 --> 00:39:55.388]  I don't know, dog.
[00:39:55.448 --> 00:39:58.609]  He's gonna make the dogs really mad.
[00:39:58.629 --> 00:39:59.789]  That's all right.
[00:39:59.829 --> 00:40:00.289]  Nellies!
[00:40:00.449 --> 00:40:02.070]  Like, kill everybody!
[00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:05.111]  I get off when I talk about cutting people's power off!
[00:40:05.131 --> 00:40:09.833]  I'm a Nelly!
[00:40:10.873 --> 00:40:12.453]  Decembering control freaks!
[00:40:12.493 --> 00:40:13.794]  How's it going, sir?
[00:40:14.154 --> 00:40:15.094]  Good, how's it going, guys?
[00:40:15.675 --> 00:40:15.875]  Good.
[00:40:16.255 --> 00:40:16.455]  Good?
[00:40:16.535 --> 00:40:16.815]  Hold on.
[00:40:17.275 --> 00:40:17.655]  Yes, sir.
[00:40:18.655 --> 00:40:19.796]  Everybody American citizen?
[00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:21.612]  We're from Texas, sir.
[00:40:22.072 --> 00:40:22.392]  I'm sorry?
[00:40:22.412 --> 00:40:23.053]  We're from Texas.
[00:40:23.573 --> 00:40:23.913]  Over here?
[00:40:24.354 --> 00:40:25.054]  You're born in Texas?
[00:40:25.475 --> 00:40:27.957]  No, I'm not born in Texas, but I live here.
[00:40:28.857 --> 00:40:29.177]  That's good.
[00:40:29.978 --> 00:40:31.639]  We work for Infowars.com out of Austin.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:32.660]  Who?
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.441]  Alex Jones Show.
[00:40:33.461 --> 00:40:40.146]  Prison Planet, your username and password can be turned up above the screen.
[00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:41.026]  Real quick, gentlemen.
[00:40:41.827 --> 00:40:42.728]  This is Immigration.
[00:40:42.768 --> 00:40:44.089]  Can you hear me pretty good, sir?
[00:40:44.169 --> 00:40:45.490]  Obviously, you're going to be recording.
[00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.151]  Now, here's the whole thing.
[00:40:47.191 --> 00:40:49.353]  This is a United States Border Patrol facility.
[00:40:51.038 --> 00:40:51.938]  Immigration checkpoint.
[00:40:52.259 --> 00:40:55.600]  We know where all the illegals are, they were just in McAllen where we're at, in the detention center.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:59.542]  Yeah, we're just, we just did a story on that.
[00:40:59.622 --> 00:41:06.645]  Are you guys here for that, uh... Yeah, we just filmed the new, we just filmed the new FEMA camp they're putting up down there in McAllen, Texas.
[00:41:06.905 --> 00:41:08.726]  So you know how everything has worked so far, right?
[00:41:08.846 --> 00:41:12.608]  Well, I mean, I'm an American citizen, we just don't understand why we have to say yes to something like that when we know we are.
[00:41:12.688 --> 00:41:13.629]  Here's the thing, gentlemen.
[00:41:13.669 --> 00:41:14.749]  Can you hear me?
[00:41:14.769 --> 00:41:14.969]  Yeah.
[00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:17.190]  Okay, can you lower the window down this far?
[00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:18.291]  No, that's as far as it goes down.
[00:41:18.311 --> 00:41:18.491]  Okay.
[00:41:19.091 --> 00:41:24.852]  The thing is that, okay, for us to know that you guys are American citizens, we have to ask, are you guys American citizens?
[00:41:24.912 --> 00:41:25.772]  If you guys are, you guys are.
[00:41:25.792 --> 00:41:27.933]  But we don't really feel like we should have to tell you.
[00:41:27.953 --> 00:41:33.354]  The thing is, we have a Bill of Rights and we really shouldn't have to tell you.
[00:41:33.374 --> 00:41:34.634]  We have a Constitution as well.
[00:41:34.774 --> 00:41:37.515]  As an individual, I shouldn't have to tell you anything.
[00:41:37.815 --> 00:41:41.656]  As an American, I shouldn't have to tell you that I'm an American.
[00:41:42.316 --> 00:41:45.899]  And you can watch the rest of that video on our YouTube channel.
[00:41:45.959 --> 00:41:48.381]  It's called Fear and Loathing at the Border Patrol Checkpoint.
[00:41:48.441 --> 00:41:51.023]  And now I want to go to a video that we just produced.
[00:41:51.043 --> 00:41:51.964]  This is from John Bowne.
[00:41:52.184 --> 00:41:53.646]  It's called Obama Setting Up an Invasion Haven.
[00:41:53.666 --> 00:41:55.667]  It's not just the southern border that's wide open.
[00:42:09.679 --> 00:42:19.308]  The Obama administration is actively bringing in people from the Middle East and Africa who are unvetted, as our FBI, as Border Patrol and Homeland Security have all said, these people are unvetted.
[00:42:19.649 --> 00:42:21.230]  And so this is the result of that.
[00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:28.817]  They talked about how their children were asking, are we going to be forced out of the country?
[00:42:32.381 --> 00:42:33.362]  Are we going to be rounded up?
[00:42:34.065 --> 00:42:38.326]  Yesterday, Obama stirred the pot of intolerance at a Baltimore mosque.
[00:42:38.626 --> 00:42:57.132]  The Obama administration would have us all believe his speech is a needed effort to assure Muslim Americans that they will not be subjected to bigotry while he shepherds in Syrian refugees into small American towns to fuel Sharia no-go areas akin to the rape and murder invasion being waged on Europe.
[00:42:57.452 --> 00:43:03.417]  There was an open display of the Quran and the word Allah placed behind the president 99 times.
[00:43:03.698 --> 00:43:15.087]  A stark contrast to Obama's speeches at Christian churches, where for example at Georgetown University in 2012, the White House had the name of Christ covered up by request.
[00:43:15.888 --> 00:43:19.109]  The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.
[00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:26.653]  But, to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated.
[00:43:26.893 --> 00:43:33.776]  Back in June of 2009, Obama gave a speech addressed to the Muslim world, titled, A New Beginning, No Less.
[00:43:34.136 --> 00:43:40.820]  In the speech, Obama went on to avoid the word terrorism, and announced the future plans to end sanctions with Iran.
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:51.587]  Two years later, Egypt was in chaos, in the throes of a violent revolution waged by the Muslim Brotherhood, accelerated by President Obama's ties to its members.
[00:43:52.147 --> 00:43:53.388]  The attacks of September 11, 2001.
[00:43:55.814 --> 00:44:09.562]  And the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view Islam as inevitably hostile not only to America and Western countries, but also to human rights.
[00:44:11.483 --> 00:44:15.565]  All this has bred more fear and more mistrust.
[00:44:18.227 --> 00:44:23.110]  So long as our relationship is defined by our differences,
[00:44:24.878 --> 00:44:27.784]  We will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace.
[00:44:28.506 --> 00:44:33.817]  As the Holy Quran tells us, be conscious of God and speak always the truth.
[00:44:37.884 --> 00:44:46.111]  American Muslims have been practicing their religion peacefully in the United States since the first mosque was built way back in 1929.
[00:44:46.352 --> 00:44:54.779]  Of course, Americans aren't wiping out Muslims, but in the Middle East, Muslims are wiping out Christians at a rate of 100,000 per year.
[00:44:54.999 --> 00:44:56.040]  Meanwhile, the U.S.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:03.287]  Justice Department is clearing the way to toughen laws regarding material support to designated domestic terror groups.
[00:45:03.487 --> 00:45:04.307]  Thanks for watching.
[00:45:22.335 --> 00:45:42.127]  Globalist puppet President Obama is subtly terrorizing the citizens of the United States with a meek anti-American rhetoric that will grow in its boldness as his unconstitutional policies grow stronger and the power of the presidency draws closer into the clutches of globalist puppet Hillary Clinton.
[00:45:42.967 --> 00:45:51.913]  We have to be consistent in condemning hateful rhetoric and violence against everyone, and that includes against Muslims here in the United States of America.
[00:45:56.956 --> 00:45:58.097]  None of us can be silent.
[00:46:00.839 --> 00:46:02.580]  We can't be bystanders to bigotry.
[00:46:06.872 --> 00:46:12.738]  So this is an active agenda to fundamentally change the character of our country, as you can see.
[00:46:13.118 --> 00:46:16.522]  Now coming up, I'm going to have Darren McGreen, who's actually sitting right beside me now, getting ready.
[00:46:16.802 --> 00:46:25.111]  We're going to be talking about how the media totally lies to you just about all the time, and especially when it comes to football, the Super Bowl, and the NFL.
[00:46:25.131 --> 00:46:25.912]  So stay tuned for that.
[00:46:40.737 --> 00:46:41.237]  What's wrong?
[00:46:41.917 --> 00:46:45.339]  You don't like a small group of psychos hijacking your country?
[00:46:45.559 --> 00:46:52.541]  Well, become President of the United States and change it from the... Never mind.
[00:46:52.561 --> 00:46:57.703]  Three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:46:57.723 --> 00:47:01.645]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[00:47:02.992 --> 00:47:04.013]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.554 --> 00:47:06.837]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.117 --> 00:47:14.946]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.469]  We're good.
[00:49:03.197 --> 00:49:16.283]  At the end of World War II, Operation Paperclip was launched by the Office of Strategic Services, the OSS, to smuggle known Nazi war criminals into the United States for recruitment into U.S.
[00:49:16.403 --> 00:49:17.643]  intelligence agencies.
[00:49:17.983 --> 00:49:23.986]  The Nazis were cleared to work in America after having their backgrounds bleached by the military.
[00:49:24.286 --> 00:49:30.870]  False employment histories were provided and their previous Nazi affiliations were completely removed from the record.
[00:49:31.111 --> 00:49:37.315]  The OSS provided a model for the Central Intelligence Agency that was established in September 1947.
[00:49:38.075 --> 00:49:44.800]  The CIA specialized in propaganda, economic warfare, sabotage and demolition.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:51.005]  So that was just a part of a video that my good friend Darren McGreen put together talking about the shocking history of the CIA.
[00:49:51.065 --> 00:49:52.866]  Darren, what can you tell us about that?
[00:49:52.886 --> 00:49:53.227]  Any more?
[00:50:14.184 --> 00:50:29.574]  Well, we know from the very beginning of the creation of television and then to the creation of the CIA that they infiltrated the news media and they've been basically using your TV set as one big giant propaganda tool for a long time, right?
[00:50:30.315 --> 00:50:37.680]  And we're going to take a look at some clips from the past as well as how the news media is manipulating you now, present day.
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:38.861]  I just want to say this.
[00:50:39.221 --> 00:50:41.042]  Why do you think they call it programming?
[00:50:41.602 --> 00:50:41.983]  That's right.
[00:50:42.023 --> 00:50:43.404]  It is television programming.
[00:50:43.584 --> 00:50:43.784]  Yeah.
[00:50:44.224 --> 00:50:45.145]  Well, we're going to take a look.
[00:50:45.165 --> 00:50:48.847]  The first clip I want to show you, this goes all the way back to 1991.
[00:50:49.607 --> 00:50:53.470]  And this was when a young girl, she testified before Congress.
[00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:58.153]  Millions of people saw this across, this was broadcast to millions of people all across the nation.
[00:50:58.613 --> 00:51:04.156]  This was instrumental in getting the US public to back a war in Iraq.
[00:51:04.296 --> 00:51:08.439]  I was there, I saw the Iraqi soldiers coming to the hospital with guns.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.341]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[00:51:14.955 --> 00:51:18.017]  She took incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:51:21.059 --> 00:51:25.781]  And little did we know, she wasn't just a hospital volunteer or worker as she claimed to be.
[00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:27.762]  She's actually the niece of an ambassador?
[00:51:28.143 --> 00:51:32.865]  Ambassador to Kuwait, to the United States, and so that was one big giant lie.
[00:51:33.466 --> 00:51:35.807]  But, you know... Don't let a lie stop you there.
[00:51:36.207 --> 00:51:42.210]  No, no, we found out years later that she was actually hired by a PR firm from New York.
[00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:44.331]  They gave her acting lessons, right?
[00:51:44.471 --> 00:52:01.698]  So, she's a 15-year-old girl, she testified before Congress, and I'll never forget it because, like I said, millions of us watched this on TV and we were shocked and horrified that Saddam Hussein's Iraqi Republican Guard was dumping babies out of incubators and onto the bloody streets of Iraq.
[00:52:01.738 --> 00:52:02.258]  It was horrible.
[00:52:02.318 --> 00:52:05.801]  But don't let that stop George Bush from taking in that story and running with it.
[00:52:05.881 --> 00:52:06.661]  Let's go to that clip.
[00:52:07.322 --> 00:52:14.767]  They had kids in incubators and they were thrown out of the incubators so that Kuwait could be systematically dismantled.
[00:52:15.487 --> 00:52:21.271]  So old man Bush was just taking a line from Rahm Emanuel, never letting a good crisis go to waste.
[00:52:21.372 --> 00:52:22.993]  And now we have new Bush.
[00:52:23.593 --> 00:52:25.094]  I guess back in 2001 or 2003?
[00:52:25.154 --> 00:52:27.254]  This was right around 2003.
[00:52:27.975 --> 00:52:32.356]  George W. Bush, he used to like to use VNRs, video news releases.
[00:52:32.776 --> 00:52:44.701]  Now this was news packages that were produced by the Pentagon and they were passed over to television studios or television all across the United States and they would use it as actual news stories.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:52.865]  President, earlier this year you told us you'd ordered your administration to cease and desist on payments to journalists to promote your agenda.
[00:52:52.905 --> 00:52:57.509]  You cited the need for ethical concerns and the need for a bright line between the press and the government.
[00:52:57.589 --> 00:53:10.138]  Your administration continues to make the use of video news releases, which are prepackaged news stories, sent to television stations, fully aware that some or many of these stations will air them without any disclaimer that they are produced by the government.
[00:53:10.478 --> 00:53:14.121]  Comptroller General of the United States this week said that raises ethical questions.
[00:53:14.481 --> 00:53:21.984]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[00:53:26.446 --> 00:53:36.011]  There is a Justice Department opinion that says these pieces are within the law so long as they're based upon facts, not advocacy.
[00:53:37.551 --> 00:53:42.974]  And I expect our agencies to adhere to that ruling, to that Justice Department opinion.
[00:53:44.326 --> 00:53:51.589]  It's been a long-standing practice of the federal government to use these types of videos.
[00:53:51.609 --> 00:53:57.512]  The Agricultural Department, as I understand, has been using these videos for a long period of time.
[00:53:58.992 --> 00:54:01.173]  The Defense Department and other departments have been doing so.
[00:54:01.613 --> 00:54:08.456]  It's important that they be based upon the guidelines set out by the Justice Department.
[00:54:08.496 --> 00:54:12.098]  Now, I also think it would be helpful if local stations
[00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:20.535]  Then disclose to their viewers that this was based upon a factual report and they chose to use it.
[00:54:22.476 --> 00:54:24.157]  Evidently, in some cases, that's not the case.
[00:54:24.177 --> 00:54:28.740]  So anyway... ...guarantee that's happening by including that language in the prepackaged report.
[00:54:29.561 --> 00:54:31.742]  Yeah, I don't, you know... Oh, you mean a disclosure?
[00:54:31.762 --> 00:54:37.166]  I'm George W. Bush and I... Well, some way to make sure it couldn't air without the disclosure that you believe is so vital.
[00:54:38.248 --> 00:54:48.207]  Uh, you know, Ken, I mean, there's a, there's a procedure that we're going to follow, and the local stations ought to, if there's a deep concern about that, ought to tell their viewers what they're watching.
[00:54:49.876 --> 00:55:01.184]  And Darren, now we have in modern day times, we have the migrant crisis going on with the Syrian refugees, and we've seen the family where the husband threw the wife, or his wife and daughter, or son down on the train tracks.
[00:55:01.204 --> 00:55:03.125]  Little baby, almost cracked the baby's head.
[00:55:03.145 --> 00:55:06.347]  Yeah, and that was a big, big, big news release.
[00:55:06.367 --> 00:55:08.029]  You know, they had photos of it everywhere.
[00:55:08.089 --> 00:55:10.090]  BBC, Reuters, all across Europe.
[00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:12.771]  Like, this is how people are treating the migrants.
[00:55:12.811 --> 00:55:15.512]  And he did that to his own wife, just to be a spectacle.
[00:55:15.532 --> 00:55:19.714]  He waited until he saw the cameras, and then you see him, how he reacted.
[00:55:19.774 --> 00:55:26.157]  And now you've got these migrant kids, these kids that they're coaching, into playing the refugee role.
[00:55:26.257 --> 00:55:33.441]  Yeah, take a look at this young kid who was tear gassed or maybe he was pepper sprayed by the evil anti-immigrant police in Hungary.
[00:55:33.941 --> 00:55:45.288]  This photo appeared in newspapers and television all throughout Europe and this is to get you to feel bad and accept the tsunami of migrants that is pouring into your country and into your neighborhood.
[00:55:45.668 --> 00:55:53.233]  Don't believe the hype because much of what you are seeing on television and in the newspapers is a total fraud.
[00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:53.853]  Check it out.
[00:55:55.279 --> 00:55:55.679]  Jump!
[00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:56.400]  Jump!
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:56.700]  Jump!
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:57.581]  Jump, fellas!
[00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:17.576]  So pulling the heartstrings of Americans and people worldwide to shove immigrants into our face and basically take down the standard of living of everybody around us.
[00:56:17.616 --> 00:56:19.297]  Now, going to the NFL.
[00:56:19.577 --> 00:56:20.778]  Here it is from Business Insider.
[00:56:20.858 --> 00:56:24.700]  Earlier last year, this is in May, the Pentagon paid 14 NFL teams $5.4 million to salute the troops.
[00:56:27.702 --> 00:56:33.726]  But by the end of the season, in November, it was up to $6.8 million of taxpayer money to pro sports teams for military tributes.
[00:56:34.026 --> 00:56:37.949]  And that's our tax money being paid to teams who don't pay their own tax.
[00:56:37.989 --> 00:56:39.950]  And this is paid patriotism.
[00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:40.210]  Right.
[00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.991]  That's what this is.
[00:56:41.051 --> 00:56:41.991]  So can you imagine?
[00:56:42.352 --> 00:56:48.435]  And so a lot of that, a moment of silence, and then you see the salute to the troops, and you see the jets flying over the stadium.
[00:56:48.696 --> 00:56:49.416]  That's paid for.
[00:56:49.976 --> 00:56:50.677]  All controlled.
[00:56:51.017 --> 00:56:51.898]  It's all controlled.
[00:56:51.958 --> 00:56:52.358]  One big control.
[00:56:52.378 --> 00:56:55.220]  And here's Senator Jeff Blake talking about this very same issue.
[00:56:56.201 --> 00:57:13.799]  When everybody assumes when you have these feel-good moments, these salutes, that it's because the NFL team just felt good about the military or about service, and then to find out now it's really the taxpayers paying for that, that just leaves you with an empty feeling.
[00:57:14.602 --> 00:57:20.126]  Jeremy Breen, thanks for joining me, and don't forget, you out there watching this on YouTube, become a member of PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:57:34.076 --> 00:57:35.997]  Hey Hillary, shouldn't you be getting ready for a debate?
[00:57:37.042 --> 00:57:40.943]  Well, I don't know if you guys heard from Bernie or not, but I did hide his car.
[00:57:41.363 --> 00:57:45.105]  So, I saw some of his guys on his team looking for it.
[00:57:45.765 --> 00:57:46.365]  I blew it up.
[00:57:46.505 --> 00:57:47.245]  It's on fire.
[00:57:47.305 --> 00:57:48.226]  So, he's not getting there.
[00:57:48.246 --> 00:57:51.026]  So, I got plenty of time to make it out there to the base.
[00:57:51.066 --> 00:57:52.947]  She Benghazi-ed Bernie Sanders' car.
[00:57:52.967 --> 00:57:53.207]  Wow.
[00:57:53.547 --> 00:57:54.127]  Well, good luck.
[00:57:54.187 --> 00:57:58.389]  It's surely going to be a sideshow tonight with you and Bernie tussling together.
[00:57:58.689 --> 00:58:00.209]  Basically, issues of no significance.
[00:58:00.249 --> 00:58:01.270]  I can't wait to see how you're coming.
[00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:02.090]  Well, I'm kind of upset.
[00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:05.551]  I was going to wear a pearl necklace, but it looks like Bill Clinton already gave it to someone.
[00:58:05.771 --> 00:58:07.873]  Well, with that, that's the end of our show, folks.
[00:58:08.193 --> 00:58:08.874]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:58:08.894 --> 00:58:11.236]  We'll see you next time on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:58:17.458 --> 00:58:22.363]  No one will go to the New York Times or care that it's even admitted that the government's hatching most of the terror plots.
[00:58:22.903 --> 00:58:24.044]  Or people will say, what are you doing?
[00:58:24.365 --> 00:58:25.566]  Endorsing radical Islam?
[00:58:25.586 --> 00:58:26.347]  Saying it doesn't exist?
[00:58:26.687 --> 00:58:27.428]  I didn't say that!
[00:58:28.128 --> 00:58:37.378]  I said our criminal government is arming them, aiding and abetting them, protecting them to attack and kill us so they can take our freedoms!
[00:58:37.898 --> 00:58:38.719]  That's what
[00:58:39.199 --> 00:58:45.902]  I said never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 proof.
[00:58:46.342 --> 00:58:50.223]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:58:52.224 --> 00:59:00.407]  CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, Glenn Beck, and everybody else that runs around claiming that I'm saying there aren't any real Muslim terrorists.
[00:59:00.747 --> 00:59:02.768]  That's a load of crud and you know it.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.001]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:16.447]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep, restful sleep, Knockout's it.
