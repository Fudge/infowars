[00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:21.986]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:25.687]  It is Tuesday, April 12, 2016, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:26.968]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.792]  Tonight, Problem Action Solution.
[00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:40.254]  George Soros has a debt scheme to pay for the influx of European migrants.
[00:00:41.254 --> 00:00:45.016]  Then, cyber criminals go after unlikely victims.
[00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:46.237]  Hospitals.
[00:00:47.328 --> 00:00:53.139]  And is it still a conspiracy theory now that the 28 pages are being questioned on 60 Minutes?
[00:00:54.855 --> 00:01:11.782]  I think it is implausible to believe that 19 people, most of whom didn't speak English, most of whom had never been in the United States before, many of whom didn't have a high school education, could have carried out such a complicated task without some support from within the United States.
[00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:16.263]  And you believe that the 28 pages are crucial to this understanding?
[00:01:16.283 --> 00:01:17.424]  I think they are a key part
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:07.022]  Well, here are some more tactics being revealed in the art of the steal.
[00:03:07.463 --> 00:03:11.548]  Ted Cruz's and Marco Rubio's supporters have now teamed up in Arkansas.
[00:03:11.568 --> 00:03:17.636]  They're going to be packing the state delegation with individuals who are going to turn against Donald Trump in a contested convention.
[00:03:18.157 --> 00:03:25.520]  So, of course, Rubio ended his presidential bid March 15th, so his network of party insiders has lined up behind Cruz.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.223]  They're going to win delegates who would vote for the Texas senator once they're no longer bound to Trump in a floor fight.
[00:03:32.303 --> 00:03:35.964]  So, of course, this contested convention is going to get pretty heated.
[00:03:36.464 --> 00:03:43.287]  Now, Donald Trump and his organization, they've been doing kind of a sloppy job there in a lot of these states in Arkansas and elsewhere.
[00:03:43.727 --> 00:03:48.650]  Meanwhile, Cruz and his camp are very efficient when it comes to working the delegate system.
[00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.272]  Now, David Knight likes to tell the story of when Alex Jones was there at the Alamo.
[00:03:53.292 --> 00:03:54.933]  They had the big open carry rally.
[00:03:55.593 --> 00:04:05.658]  Senator Ted Cruz, who's supposedly so big on gun rights and he's Mr. Second Amendment, he was right across the street in a hotel where you could see thousands of
[00:04:06.438 --> 00:04:08.179]  Texans air open carry rally.
[00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:21.226]  He didn't even wave out the window and give a little hello because he was at an actual tea party with little blue hair ladies from the Republican Party and that's that's Ted Cruz in a nutshell.
[00:04:21.286 --> 00:04:26.509]  He doesn't need to go out there and talk to the voters who would support him and his second carry views.
[00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.871]  He's inside with the delegates and with the people who have the real power.
[00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.993]  Now Ted Cruz of course is coming out and attacking
[00:04:34.713 --> 00:04:39.238]  The Drudge Report saying that it's an attack site for the Trump campaign.
[00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:45.445]  He says they're attacking him on a daily basis while they support the Trump campaign.
[00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:53.253]  And he in the past has really praised the Drudge Report saying that over the years they've done a good job highlighting the excesses of the left.
[00:04:54.054 --> 00:05:02.156]  Also, congratulated Matt Drudge for being able to break through through the establishment media, the mainstream media stranglehold on the news.
[00:05:02.276 --> 00:05:07.958]  But now that Matt Drudge, who is not beholden to the establishment media, is not kissing cruises, but he doesn't like it.
[00:05:08.018 --> 00:05:14.960]  He says, you know, in Colorado they won and there was no red siren on the Drudge report when we won all 34 delegates.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.641]  No, he was highlighting how it was stolen.
[00:05:17.961 --> 00:05:18.501]  I don't
[00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:45.205]  You feel like you're out there, you're the will of the people, and it's being suppressed by this whole superdelegate system.
[00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:47.988]  Well, that's what's happening on the Democratic side, too.
[00:05:48.388 --> 00:05:54.154]  Now the Clinton camp is accusing Sanders of rigging the system with the superdelegates.
[00:05:54.534 --> 00:05:55.896]  It's Clinton's press secretary.
[00:05:56.456 --> 00:06:02.402]  He remarked that Sanders is trying to rig the system by attempting to court superdelegates currently allied with Clinton.
[00:06:03.183 --> 00:06:08.127]  Really, I think when you talk about rigging the system, that's when Senator Sanders is trying to do now.
[00:06:08.207 --> 00:06:10.288]  This is what Fallon said in an interview with CNN.
[00:06:10.368 --> 00:06:14.151]  He said, Hillary Clinton has won in the popular vote by a wide margin.
[00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:16.093]  She's got more than two million votes.
[00:06:16.813 --> 00:06:19.595]  And then he goes on, you know, now Sanders is coming along.
[00:06:19.655 --> 00:06:28.422]  He wants to try and flip the superdelegates and get him to overturn the will of the people as expressed through who's won the most contests.
[00:06:28.782 --> 00:06:29.542]  So there you go.
[00:06:29.602 --> 00:06:30.523]  The will of the people.
[00:06:30.603 --> 00:06:31.004]  Now we've
[00:06:31.884 --> 00:06:36.865]  You're saying this when we see it on the Trump side, the will of the people being suppressed there by the superdelegates.
[00:06:37.286 --> 00:06:42.707]  And you'll see in the mainstream media, they're trying to say that this is only happening on the Republican side, but it's both.
[00:06:43.107 --> 00:06:45.348]  Now, Roger Stone was on the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:06:45.388 --> 00:06:55.931]  Of course, you know, he's been blacklisted from even talking to the media for daring to tell people that they should go and approach the delegates themselves at the convention.
[00:06:57.401 --> 00:07:07.305]  So, Ted Cruz, you know, he has a problem with the First Amendment, quite obviously, and this wild punch at either me or Matt Drudge is senseless.
[00:07:07.325 --> 00:07:15.869]  Look, there was a media uproar last week when I suggested that Trump supporters visit the hotels of delegates.
[00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:17.610]  Let me be a little more specific.
[00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:24.296]  From the beginning, the problem here has been one of Trojan delegates.
[00:07:24.637 --> 00:07:26.760]  Trojan horse delegates.
[00:07:27.361 --> 00:07:32.628]  These Trojan horse delegates are very specifically
[00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:40.793]  Holding seats in delegate positions who are elected to Donald Trump but not loyal to Trump.
[00:07:41.273 --> 00:07:52.460]  The party machines are seeking to insert these hacks, these loyalists, into delegations which gives them a majority.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:08:02.386]  On the question of rules, credentials, and platform, all of which must come before the first ballot for president.
[00:08:02.746 --> 00:08:19.036]  So even if Donald Trump has 1,237 votes, which under the capable leadership of Paul Manafort and the incredible talents as a candidate and a communicator of Donald Trump, I think they will have
[00:08:19.636 --> 00:08:23.281]  The establishment plans to steal this anyway.
[00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:29.709]  It is these Trojan horse delegates who will be central to the steal.
[00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:36.358]  What I suggest, quite frankly, is that each one of them be required to sign a loyalty pledge
[00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:46.285]  It's voluntary, of course, agreeing to stick with Donald Trump, the choice of the voters, the voters who elected that delegate.
[00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:50.147]  They should pledge to stand with the popular vote or move to North Korea.
[00:08:50.687 --> 00:08:51.007]  Correct.
[00:08:51.208 --> 00:08:59.613]  Now, you're not forced to sign, but if you won't sign, it will identify for the media who the quizlings are.
[00:08:59.793 --> 00:09:00.113]  That's right.
[00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:04.916]  If you're going to steal an election in America and cancel America, you better put your John Hancock on it.
[00:09:05.714 --> 00:09:11.459]  Right, so it exposes the bosses who are subverting the democratic process.
[00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:15.081]  Donald Trump is winning these primaries big.
[00:09:15.482 --> 00:09:17.703]  This just in, he won Arkansas.
[00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:26.611]  Now there is a Cruz-Rubio alliance planning to block Donald Trump in Arkansas from getting his rightful majority.
[00:09:27.251 --> 00:09:31.935]  We've seen the strong arm tactics that were utilized in Colorado.
[00:09:32.455 --> 00:09:44.420]  We have seen a rare victory where Donald Trump and the forces loyal to John Kasich teamed together to block Ted Cruz out in Michigan.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.702]  So two can play this game and I expect it's going to be hard fought right to the end.
[00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:52.103]  We are going to march on Cleveland.
[00:09:54.599 --> 00:10:00.521]  Delegations, we're going to ask every Trump delegate to sign the voluntary pledge.
[00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:03.322]  Are you with the voters or are you with the bosses?
[00:10:03.742 --> 00:10:08.224]  It's only elementary that Trump delegates should vote for Donald Trump.
[00:10:09.463 --> 00:10:17.228]  And of course the media has said Roger Stone is hateful and he's aggressive by daring to tell the American people that they should go and talk to the delegates.
[00:10:17.748 --> 00:10:21.871]  But now Bernie Sanders supporters are accused of doing the exact same thing.
[00:10:22.411 --> 00:10:33.858]  Among those efforts is a website created last week under the name Superdelegate Hit List and it provides phone numbers and addresses for superdelegates and encourages users to submit further contact information
[00:10:34.218 --> 00:10:36.620]  Presumably to help advocates pressure them.
[00:10:37.001 --> 00:10:44.769]  Now, of course, the Sanders campaign says it has no connection to the efforts of these outside supporters to lean on the superdelegates.
[00:10:45.249 --> 00:10:48.252]  But I say Sanders must disavow.
[00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:53.557]  But we're not hearing anyone saying that this is, you know, they're not, they're peaceful.
[00:10:53.857 --> 00:10:55.599]  The Bernie Sanders people, they're peaceful.
[00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:58.042]  They create this site called the Superdelegate Hit List.
[00:10:58.542 --> 00:10:59.803]  It's a loving hit list.
[00:11:00.143 --> 00:11:07.966]  Just take a look at this Black Lives Matter protester who claims that the Trump supporter was there to bring the hate.
[00:11:08.747 --> 00:11:15.369]  So this Black Lives Matter protester said she was there to protest against hatred and then
[00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:17.310]  Boom!
[00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:23.394]  Spits the Trump supporter in the face because that is loving when you assault someone with your bodily fluids.
[00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:25.295]  This is here again.
[00:11:25.395 --> 00:11:27.737]  We're seeing what is happening on the other side of the fence.
[00:11:28.177 --> 00:11:34.441]  But never mind what you can see with your own eyes, what you're witnessing, what you're hearing repeatedly again and again and again.
[00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:38.063]  It's the Trump supporters who are hateful, racist, whatever.
[00:11:38.643 --> 00:11:41.785]  The Black Lives Matter protesters are again are standing in front
[00:11:42.365 --> 00:11:44.606]  Of a light rail that was headed to a game.
[00:11:44.986 --> 00:11:57.712]  They had mostly white supporters there, the Black Lives Matter movement, and they were trying to recruit more white people to their Black Lives Matter movement by upsetting their plans and saying, join us or else.
[00:11:58.513 --> 00:12:01.274]  Well, why don't you guys join InfoWars?
[00:12:01.494 --> 00:12:09.998]  We are going to be heading to Colorado as well as Portland, Oregon this week, and we would like to see you there as we defend free elections and free speech.
[00:12:14.554 --> 00:12:23.301]  My fellow Infowarriors, my fellow Americans, there's never been an attack on our voting rights and our free speech in this country's history like we're seeing right now.
[00:12:23.882 --> 00:12:27.205]  Last weekend they cancelled the election in Colorado.
[00:12:28.103 --> 00:12:28.343]  I think so.
[00:12:47.912 --> 00:12:53.958]  We're going to show you some of that footage where the left has announced with communist banners, no free speech, no Trump allowed.
[00:12:54.339 --> 00:12:56.981]  So this is pure tyranny, an attack on free speech on every front.
[00:12:57.021 --> 00:12:58.323]  Rob Dew, tell us about the events.
[00:12:58.503 --> 00:13:08.193]  Alright, so Friday, April 15th from 3 to 6, we're going to be at the Colorado GOP headquarters at 5950 South Willow Drive, and that's in Greenwood Village, Colorado.
[00:13:08.213 --> 00:13:11.276]  We're going to go there and support the rest of the GOP.
[00:13:11.756 --> 00:13:12.677]  Who's mad as hell.
[00:13:12.817 --> 00:13:20.101]  One million GOP-ers are pissed off that they didn't get to cast their vote for the President of the United States, for the Republican Party.
[00:13:20.301 --> 00:13:23.263]  And imagine if a million black people had been disenfranchised.
[00:13:23.283 --> 00:13:24.364]  People are upset about that.
[00:13:24.504 --> 00:13:25.124]  Jim Crow laws.
[00:13:25.204 --> 00:13:25.564]  I am too.
[00:13:25.584 --> 00:13:29.126]  But what about what's happening now to everybody and this president?
[00:13:29.166 --> 00:13:29.807]  And let's be clear.
[00:13:30.327 --> 00:13:32.229]  This is about free speech, not even about Trump.
[00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:33.750]  This is very, very important.
[00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.914]  Everybody needs to be there, and everybody needs to get their friends and family together.
[00:13:39.555 --> 00:13:42.357]  Portland State students for Donald Trump, that'll start at 2 o'clock.
[00:13:43.278 --> 00:13:45.940]  Location will be the Smith Memorial Student Union.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.284]  That's at 1825 Southwest Broadway in Portland, Oregon.
[00:13:50.644 --> 00:13:55.708]  So we're going to be out there as well, standing with these students who want to have this meeting in support of Donald Trump.
[00:13:55.748 --> 00:13:56.469]  That is their right.
[00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:57.690]  That is their freedom of speech.
[00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.451]  And these bullies!
[00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:00.392]  Bullies have been trying to stop it.
[00:14:00.432 --> 00:14:05.316]  So on InfoWars.com, we're going to have an article up by tonight, breaking down the maps, where it is.
[00:14:05.416 --> 00:14:08.179]  Come out and support these reporters, also in free speech.
[00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:13.003]  But they're going to be wearing Trump hats and InfoWars shirts just to show the type of garbage that's going on.
[00:14:13.243 --> 00:14:14.104]  You've seen the clips, Biggs.
[00:14:14.144 --> 00:14:16.586]  We're going to play just a few clips of it now of Portland.
[00:14:16.806 --> 00:14:17.627]  These people are scary.
[00:14:17.967 --> 00:14:18.807]  I'm on set!
[00:14:18.867 --> 00:14:19.227]  You f***er!
[00:14:19.307 --> 00:14:20.028]  Shut the f*** up!
[00:14:20.088 --> 00:14:22.669]  If you don't let her talk, I will f*** it up!
[00:14:46.036 --> 00:14:50.718]  What's incredible about Portland is that it's faculty there screaming at people saying, you have no free speech.
[00:14:50.738 --> 00:14:51.158]  The staff.
[00:14:51.198 --> 00:14:52.318]  Yeah, the staff was yelling at people.
[00:14:52.418 --> 00:14:54.739]  They're like, shut up, sit down, we're going to tell you what's going on.
[00:14:55.059 --> 00:14:58.000]  And they said, if you have another event, we're going to come back.
[00:14:58.341 --> 00:14:58.961]  So here it is.
[00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:01.001]  There's going to be another event on Saturday.
[00:15:01.061 --> 00:15:01.962]  So are you going to be there?
[00:15:02.042 --> 00:15:02.422]  We'll see.
[00:15:02.622 --> 00:15:05.243]  We'll see if free speech gets under attack at Portland State University.
[00:15:05.583 --> 00:15:10.165]  Those six brave people went and stood against the First Amendment fascism.
[00:15:11.025 --> 00:15:13.048]  of the corporately George Soros funded left.
[00:15:13.148 --> 00:15:20.879]  Let's have hundreds of people show up where they're slated speakers by the student group to stand up for free speech and stand up against this malice level tyranny.
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.684]  Joe Biggs, one more time, tell folks the date of the Portland situation.
[00:15:24.745 --> 00:15:26.487]  Do it one more time for what's happening Friday.
[00:15:26.587 --> 00:15:30.148]  So once again, Saturday the 16th at Portland State Students for Donald Trump.
[00:15:30.428 --> 00:15:31.429]  That'll be at 2 o'clock.
[00:15:31.529 --> 00:15:32.269]  That is the start time.
[00:15:32.289 --> 00:15:34.150]  I would arrive a little bit early and get ready to go in there.
[00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:39.872]  The location is at the Smith Memorial Student Union and that's at 1825 Southwest Broadway.
[00:15:40.312 --> 00:15:44.853]  The 15th, the GOP protest in Colorado will be at Greenwood Village, Colorado from 3 to 6.
[00:15:44.913 --> 00:15:49.235]  Put all the address information and maps on in the article and in the description of the video.
[00:15:49.875 --> 00:15:50.996]  All right, fantastic folks.
[00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:52.238]  Hey, stand up for the First Amendment.
[00:15:52.598 --> 00:15:53.699]  Stand up for your voting rights.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.623]  There should be an election in Colorado and other states.
[00:15:56.903 --> 00:15:58.304]  There should be a thing called voters.
[00:15:58.665 --> 00:16:01.808]  Soon they're going to say voters never existed and it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:16:02.028 --> 00:16:02.689]  I'm not joking.
[00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.154]  Now's the time to stand up for free speech and freedom of the press and voting or lose it all.
[00:16:11.892 --> 00:16:19.354]  Coming up, Jerome Corsi of World Net Daily joined the Alex Jones Show today to talk about another conservative coup that's on the horizon.
[00:16:20.174 --> 00:16:26.495]  Phyllis Schlafly is attempting to save her position in a company that she founded nearly 40 years ago.
[00:16:26.856 --> 00:16:36.338]  But first, David Knight will be joining me in studio to talk about some lawmakers, no not conspiracy theorists, who are demanding the release of the 28 pages.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.842]  For the few who have seen them, they're known as the 28 pages.
[00:16:56.182 --> 00:17:02.886]  In those pages are names of people who allegedly helped the Al-Qaeda killers, but who have never been held accountable.
[00:17:02.906 --> 00:17:10.190]  Potential sources of foreign support for the September 11th hijackers, classified by the Bush administration.
[00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:14.752]  Why the 28 pages remain hidden from the public remains a mystery.
[00:17:14.912 --> 00:17:20.496]  We know the 28 pages from Senator Graham and Senator Jones that have seen it, and military we've had on that have seen it.
[00:17:20.756 --> 00:17:23.598]  It says Saudi Arabia ran the attacks to blame Iraq.
[00:17:23.638 --> 00:17:24.558]  That was always the plan.
[00:17:25.159 --> 00:17:27.060]  And then our own government, bare minimum, stood down.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.341]  And of course, it was more than that.
[00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:32.704]  But we have the fact that it now, to a great extent, was an inside job.
[00:17:32.984 --> 00:17:37.828]  I have read the 28 pages and the 28 pages have nothing to do with national security.
[00:17:38.008 --> 00:17:38.328]  Nothing.
[00:17:38.508 --> 00:17:39.469]  I wouldn't be standing here.
[00:17:40.009 --> 00:17:43.292]  It's all about relationships and involvement in 9-11.
[00:17:43.492 --> 00:17:45.894]  I want those documents declassified.
[00:17:45.954 --> 00:17:49.717]  I'm embarrassed to be associated with a work product.
[00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:51.539]  That is secret.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:18:02.806]  I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the September 11th attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia.
[00:18:03.206 --> 00:18:05.087]  He called it a smoking gun.
[00:18:05.468 --> 00:18:11.931]  And he went on to say the reason for this cover-up goes right up to the White House.
[00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:13.893]  This is sort of shocking when you read it.
[00:18:14.073 --> 00:18:16.074]  As I read it, we all had our own experience.
[00:18:16.704 --> 00:18:27.835]  I had to stop every couple pages and just sort of absorb and try to rearrange my understanding of history for the past 13 years and the years leading up to that.
[00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.212]  It challenges you to rethink everything.
[00:18:31.852 --> 00:18:36.055]  What do we know is in the 28 censored pages of the 9-11 report?
[00:18:36.375 --> 00:18:38.757]  People that have seen it said it would bring down the whole system.
[00:18:39.097 --> 00:18:42.680]  I've met with and talked to multiple members of Congress who read it.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.881]  They are convinced the American people need to see it.
[00:18:44.901 --> 00:18:51.245]  It has to do with information which is not convenient to the White House, either White House, the Clinton White House, or the Bush White House.
[00:18:51.706 --> 00:18:58.070]  And it has to do with an ally who essentially looked the other way and allowed a lot of support for the terrorists who conducted the attack.
[00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:14.475]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very very carefully because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many many people around me.
[00:19:15.015 --> 00:19:21.437]  I was a big sports enthusiast but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old up to about 22 or so.
[00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:28.102]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:34.408]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work, I stopped working out.
[00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:39.193]  And everything was okay for four or five years, but then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:43.096]  And in the next 10 years, I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:56.459]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances, and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight, and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.040]  I even changed my diet.
[00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.742]  I even increased the exercise.
[00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:00.303]  It didn't work.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:06.190]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed
[00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.177]  My whole life changed.
[00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:14.844]  I've gone from 200 and almost 80 pounds down to about 220 pounds or so.
[00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:16.446]  It is incredible.
[00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:24.635]  And in just the last three years, Super Male Vitality, developed by Dr. Grube for mfulworthslife.com exclusively,
[00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:32.462]  And products like the Survival Shield X2 Nascent Ionine have just done incredible things for my body.
[00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:40.090]  I work out less, even though I'm older, I've lost more weight, my muscles got stronger, my stamina, my libido, and so much more.

[00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:07.833]  My brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe, and I'm proud of what he did.
[00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:13.996]  And he's had the gall to go after my mother.
[00:23:14.016 --> 00:23:16.258]  He's had the gall to go after my mother.
[00:23:19.443 --> 00:23:24.229]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 commission report?
[00:23:24.249 --> 00:23:25.531]  Would you be wanting to see those released?
[00:23:26.292 --> 00:23:27.073]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[00:23:27.093 --> 00:23:27.413]  You got them?
[00:23:28.274 --> 00:23:29.896]  Well, hopefully we can get them.
[00:23:30.297 --> 00:23:30.717]  Thank you.
[00:23:31.398 --> 00:23:32.539]  Well, that's right, Jeb Bush.
[00:23:32.659 --> 00:23:33.941]  We all want to see the 28 pages.
[00:23:35.663 --> 00:23:36.364]  And you know what?
[00:23:36.384 --> 00:23:44.749]  You're not going to be able to make a mockery of it very soon because it's not just Alex Jones Radio Show listeners who would like to see this report declassified.
[00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:51.995]  Lawmakers are also now calling on the White House to declassify more than two dozen pages of the 9-11 Commission.
[00:23:52.355 --> 00:23:56.157]  And as well, 60 Minutes is getting in on the Truther movement.
[00:23:56.818 --> 00:23:58.559]  Joining me now is David Knight.
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.460]  So David, what do we think about this?
[00:24:00.481 --> 00:24:01.321]  9-11 is not going away.
[00:24:02.702 --> 00:24:07.706]  Yeah Leanne, it's I guess better late than never that CBS would cover.
[00:24:07.726 --> 00:24:18.855]  We're going to talk about what they did this weekend in terms of looking at the missing 28 pages, as well as many of the members of the 9-11 Commission who said this should never have been classified.
[00:24:18.875 --> 00:24:20.076]  We want this information out there.
[00:24:20.116 --> 00:24:22.878]  Before we do though, I want to cover what just happened yesterday.
[00:24:22.898 --> 00:24:25.160]  We had Donald Trump go to the 9-11 Museum.
[00:24:26.602 --> 00:24:27.202]  And donate $100,000.
[00:24:27.763 --> 00:24:35.326]  And he used it as a moment to troll Ted Cruz on Ted Cruz's famous New York values comment.
[00:24:36.306 --> 00:24:40.628]  When he gave the donation he said, this is what New York values are really about.
[00:24:40.648 --> 00:24:43.550]  And of course that's a reference to what happened during the debate.
[00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:50.213]  When Ted Cruz said New York values when he talked about Donald Trump, he said, hey, he's got New York values.
[00:24:50.633 --> 00:24:55.156]  Ted Cruz came back and said, no, what I'm talking about is a state socially and politically liberal leanings.
[00:24:55.216 --> 00:25:00.719]  But Trump has publicly stated Cruz represents Texas and he has a hatred for New York.
[00:25:00.739 --> 00:25:01.759]  So that's the way he's playing it.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.780]  But I want to go back to the 9-11.
[00:25:05.663 --> 00:25:09.425]  Commission and the classified 28 pages.
[00:25:10.005 --> 00:25:10.925]  This all came out.
[00:25:11.025 --> 00:25:16.688]  Not only did they have the exchange that you just saw where he's saying, your brother didn't keep us safe.
[00:25:17.048 --> 00:25:19.109]  We had the twin towers come down during his reign.
[00:25:19.509 --> 00:25:22.811]  And of course, Jeb says, yeah, you got these papers being very sarcastic about it.
[00:25:22.871 --> 00:25:25.092]  But here's what really set people off.
[00:25:25.392 --> 00:25:30.714]  They started calling Donald Trump a truther when in a South Carolina town hall, he made these comments.
[00:25:31.522 --> 00:25:34.245]  It wasn't the Iraqis that knocked down the World Trade Center.
[00:25:34.705 --> 00:25:38.709]  We went after Iraq, we decimated the country, Iran's taken over, okay.
[00:25:39.129 --> 00:25:40.710]  But it wasn't the Iraqis.
[00:25:41.551 --> 00:25:46.396]  You will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center, because they have papers in there that are very secret.
[00:25:46.516 --> 00:25:48.878]  You may find it's the Saudis, okay?
[00:25:49.588 --> 00:25:53.170]  Okay, Donald Trump said, you're going to find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center.
[00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:56.131]  It wasn't the Iraqis that you staged this Iraq war with.
[00:25:56.151 --> 00:25:58.733]  No, you're going to find out it was the Saudis.
[00:25:59.173 --> 00:26:02.134]  And because he said that, National Review said this.
[00:26:02.234 --> 00:26:06.056]  They said, it makes perfect sense that Donald Trump is a 9-11 truther.
[00:26:08.057 --> 00:26:08.398]  Oh, okay.
[00:26:08.418 --> 00:26:10.380]  You know, a truth or a conspiracy theorist.
[00:26:10.781 --> 00:26:12.222]  This is how they opened up the article.
[00:26:12.282 --> 00:26:12.683]  Look at this.
[00:26:13.163 --> 00:26:18.510]  In South Carolina, Donald Trump turned into an Alex Jones Show caller.
[00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.792]  Well, he's in good company, because you know what?
[00:26:21.173 --> 00:26:22.715]  Like all of our Alex Jones callers,
[00:26:23.355 --> 00:26:30.637]  You know what's happening, just like Senator Bob Graham, who was the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who was on the 9-11 Commission.
[00:26:31.137 --> 00:26:39.518]  You also know, like Steve Kroft at 60 Minutes, Senator Bob Kerry, John Layman, who was the Reagan administration's Secretary of the Navy.
[00:26:39.538 --> 00:26:46.620]  They were all on the 9-11 Commission, and just like Alex Jones listeners, they want these pages released as well.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.101]  Let's listen to what Senator Bob Graham said on the 60 Minutes interview.
[00:26:51.861 --> 00:27:08.788]  I think it is implausible to believe that 19 people, most of whom didn't speak English, most of whom had never been in the United States before, many of whom didn't have a high school education, could have carried out such a complicated task without some support from within the United States.
[00:27:09.208 --> 00:27:12.449]  And you believe that the 28 pages are crucial to this?
[00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:14.510]  I think they are a key part.
[00:27:15.471 --> 00:27:21.173]  I remain deeply disturbed by the amount of material that has been censored from this report.
[00:27:22.085 --> 00:27:31.372]  Okay, so Leanne, that was the middle of February that Donald Trump made those comments in town hall, and then they come out and say on National Review, he sounds like an Alex Jones caller.
[00:27:31.472 --> 00:27:48.965]  Okay, here we are two months later, and that clip that you just saw, that was former Senator Bob Graham, who was the Senate Intelligence Committee Chair, the Select Intelligence Committee Chair, and he is saying it's implausible that these guys who don't know anything could have done this without help in the United States.
[00:27:49.645 --> 00:27:51.126]  Of course they need help in the United States.
[00:27:51.166 --> 00:27:52.566]  Now, where is this leading?
[00:27:52.606 --> 00:27:59.310]  First of all, they said, and they had a lot of major thrust of the 60 Minutes report was, why is this being covered up?
[00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.591]  And they say, well, we don't know.
[00:28:01.711 --> 00:28:05.693]  We asked them, tell us why, and they said, it's classified because we say so.
[00:28:06.368 --> 00:28:12.974]  And so they have Porter Goss, who later became a head of the CIA, and he said, I don't understand why this is classified.
[00:28:13.014 --> 00:28:17.277]  Bob Graham says he's deeply disturbed by the amount of information that's been censored from this report.
[00:28:17.958 --> 00:28:23.042]  And Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes says this to him, he says, you believe the support that these guys had came from Saudi Arabia?
[00:28:23.062 --> 00:28:23.923]  And he says, substantially.
[00:28:24.163 --> 00:28:27.225]  And when we say the Saudis, Kroft says, you mean the government?
[00:28:27.386 --> 00:28:31.929]  And Bob Graham says, I mean, and Kroft goes on, the rich people in the country, charities?
[00:28:31.969 --> 00:28:33.671]  He said, all of the above.
[00:28:34.386 --> 00:28:42.353]  And then they point out, CBS says, Graham and others believe the Saudi role has been soft-pedaled to protect a delicate relationship with a complicated kingdom.
[00:28:42.393 --> 00:28:43.313]  It's complicated, you know?
[00:28:43.514 --> 00:28:44.655]  They just cut people's heads off.
[00:28:44.895 --> 00:28:46.416]  They're complicated.
[00:28:46.656 --> 00:28:55.704]  Look, they also point out in the CBS article, Saudi Arabia's biggest exports are oil and Wahhabism.
[00:28:56.444 --> 00:28:59.227]  We had a caller who called us during one of the debates and he says, look,
[00:28:59.927 --> 00:29:00.788]  I'm a Muslim.
[00:29:01.148 --> 00:29:05.113]  I support Donald Trump because I, too, am concerned about the open borders.
[00:29:05.513 --> 00:29:09.017]  He said, as a Muslim, I don't want to see the Wahhabis coming in.
[00:29:09.437 --> 00:29:13.802]  Other Muslims are afraid of the Wahhabism that is sold in Saudi Arabia.
[00:29:13.822 --> 00:29:14.783]  Right.
[00:29:14.803 --> 00:29:18.747]  Why do we protect these people in this quote-unquote complicated relationship?
[00:29:18.767 --> 00:29:19.608]  Yeah, it's complicated.
[00:29:20.108 --> 00:29:20.349]  Okay.
[00:29:20.929 --> 00:29:30.158]  And so they go on and they talk about this, and the facts of this, or they have some meetings that were made, they talk about some revelations about meetings that were done in L.A.
[00:29:31.511 --> 00:29:37.434]  A guy who is at the Saudi Arabia Embassy, then he meets with some of these people who were involved in the hijackers and so forth and so on.
[00:29:37.454 --> 00:29:39.395]  Look, it's not that complicated.
[00:29:39.995 --> 00:29:43.877]  Saudi Arabia has a very deep relationship with the United States.
[00:29:44.017 --> 00:29:50.520]  Prince Bandar, the Saudi intelligence committee previously, as well as the CIA, they have been joined at the hip.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.682]  You can't tell where the CIA ends and the Saudi intelligence community begins.
[00:29:55.442 --> 00:30:00.409]  We have a relationship that is very important to our finances here.
[00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:08.801]  You have to understand that when the gold backing of the United States dollar, which the United States dollar was the world's reserve currency after World War II,
[00:30:09.677 --> 00:30:18.927]  Once the European and Western allies and the rest of the world started to realize that, hey, we're not backing our money with any real gold, then confidence collapsed.
[00:30:19.407 --> 00:30:20.628]  They had to come up with something else.
[00:30:20.648 --> 00:30:21.810]  So they did Bretton Woods II.
[00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.091]  They took us off the gold standard.
[00:30:23.191 --> 00:30:28.737]  Nixon and Kissinger worked a deal with Saudi Arabia whereby we would establish the petrodollar.
[00:30:28.977 --> 00:30:31.660]  The petrodollar, working with Saudi Arabia,
[00:30:32.541 --> 00:30:35.603]  Denominating all of the oil sales and U.S.
[00:30:35.703 --> 00:30:40.327]  dollars, that has been the foundation, what we call the petrodollar, that has made the U.S.
[00:30:40.407 --> 00:30:41.688]  currency the world currency.
[00:30:41.728 --> 00:30:48.394]  So they're very reluctant to show any connection with the Saudis, anything that would make them look bad.
[00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:58.382]  Now, as they're talking about in these 28 pages, it's going to expose a lot of Saudi government connections with this, just as Donald Trump said.
[00:30:58.802 --> 00:31:00.464]  Donald Trump isn't going anywhere.
[00:31:01.124 --> 00:31:01.705]  We're good to go.
[00:31:16.058 --> 00:31:19.199]  But people need to start looking at the rest of the story as well.
[00:31:19.699 --> 00:31:23.220]  The common core math of two planes taking down three buildings.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.580]  Does that make any sense to you?
[00:31:24.901 --> 00:31:26.581]  It's absolute nonsense.
[00:31:26.901 --> 00:31:30.682]  But when we put this out, what does the Saudi Arabian Embassy come back with?
[00:31:31.062 --> 00:31:31.583]  What do they say?
[00:31:32.103 --> 00:31:32.703]  It's a myth!
[00:31:33.223 --> 00:31:33.803]  It's a myth!
[00:31:34.143 --> 00:31:36.484]  The Saudi Arabian Embassy... It's not a conspiracy theory!
[00:31:36.924 --> 00:31:37.424]  It's a myth.
[00:31:37.524 --> 00:31:47.390]  Because conspiracy theory, I think that is a trademark slogan of the CIA and the FBI to basically shut down anybody that wants to question their conspiracy theory.
[00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.451]  Understand, they've sold us a conspiracy theory.
[00:31:49.731 --> 00:31:51.032]  It's a phony conspiracy theory.
[00:31:51.132 --> 00:31:52.473]  It doesn't match the facts.
[00:31:52.893 --> 00:31:56.555]  But if you question that, they will call it, as the Saudis did, a myth.
[00:31:56.815 --> 00:32:04.522]  Right, well it's not a myth the Bush ties to the Bin Laden family or the fact that the Bin Laden family was flown out of the country immediately following 9-11.
[00:32:05.002 --> 00:32:05.743]  That's not a myth.
[00:32:06.063 --> 00:32:11.268]  And we're seeing how complicit the media is in covering up for the establishment players.
[00:32:11.728 --> 00:32:14.811]  And just like with this, now, what is it, 14 years later?
[00:32:15.392 --> 00:32:17.033]  So trying to cover up this story.
[00:32:17.354 --> 00:32:19.075]  They're all going to be found complicit.
[00:32:19.295 --> 00:32:22.278]  No one wants to look and question any of the facts.
[00:32:22.418 --> 00:32:23.259]  And if you question it,
[00:32:23.965 --> 00:32:24.645]  It's all been settled.
[00:32:24.885 --> 00:32:25.626]  This is just a myth.
[00:32:25.766 --> 00:32:26.526]  It's just a theory.
[00:32:26.546 --> 00:32:27.527]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:32:27.927 --> 00:32:29.008]  Shut up and listen to us.
[00:32:29.308 --> 00:32:35.551]  No matter what pilots for 9-11 Truths say, no matter what engineers and architects for 9-11 Truths say, just shut up and accept it.
[00:32:35.811 --> 00:32:36.871]  You're not supposed to look at it.
[00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:47.637]  Well, we are going to get that information and we are going to find out this dirty secret about this dangerous regime, Saudi Arabia, that has been so intricately linked with both Republicans and Democrats.
[00:32:47.737 --> 00:32:50.278]  That's one of the reasons they hate Donald Trump and want to shut him down.
[00:32:50.777 --> 00:32:51.738]  Who are you working for, brother?
[00:32:52.399 --> 00:32:52.920]  Same people.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.381]  What do you mean, same people?
[00:32:54.401 --> 00:32:55.583]  Infowars.com.
[00:32:55.803 --> 00:32:56.684]  Infowars.com?
[00:32:56.784 --> 00:32:57.505]  I've never heard of it.
[00:32:57.545 --> 00:33:01.670]  Is it like a very powerful group?
[00:33:02.371 --> 00:33:04.754]  A lot of people ask me, what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:18.180]  Just one month after she endorsed Donald Trump for president, conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly says she is facing down an attempt to oust her from Eagle Forum, which is the grassroots organization that she founded more than 44 years ago.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.823]  She's the CEO and board chairman.
[00:37:21.463 --> 00:37:31.868]  In a curious and specific statement that she sent out to reporters, Schlafly said, at 2pm today, six directors of Eagle Forum met in an improper, unprecedented telephone meeting.
[00:37:32.248 --> 00:37:36.230]  I objected to the meeting at 2.11pm and was muted from the call.
[00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:43.513]  The meeting was invalid under the bylaws, but the attendees purported to pass several motions to wrest control of the organization from me.
[00:37:44.033 --> 00:37:55.063]  They are attempting to seize access to our bank accounts, to terminate employees, and to install members of their own gang of six to control the bank accounts and all of Eagle Forum.
[00:37:55.603 --> 00:38:02.229]  Now, Roger Stone was on the Alex Jones Show today and he says the Cruz campaign is behind the mugging of Schlafly.
[00:38:03.149 --> 00:38:05.732]  He says the six Eagle Forum board members
[00:38:06.352 --> 00:38:19.764]  Our members who support Cruz and they're attempting to remove Schlafly who's 91 years old as the CEO and board chairman of her conservative group because she endorsed Donald Trump for president and the Cruz supporters are not acting alone.
[00:38:20.385 --> 00:38:24.909]  Stone says it's a hijacking by a gang of goons and as it will be proven very shortly,
[00:38:25.209 --> 00:38:29.831]  This plot targeting Phyllis reaches all the way to the top levels of the Cruz campaign.
[00:38:30.211 --> 00:38:36.493]  He described it as a mugging of a 91-year-old woman who was a founder of the modern conservative movement.
[00:38:36.873 --> 00:38:45.756]  And of course it's these gang of six basically saying that at 91 years old there's no way Phyllis Schlafly could be in charge of her full faculties.
[00:38:45.796 --> 00:38:47.016]  They actually mention this.
[00:38:47.317 --> 00:38:50.998]  I mean she's, if you've listened to her at all, she's still a supremely sharp
[00:38:51.938 --> 00:39:21.438]  Human being and even just this letter that she sent out to reporters you can tell she's completely aware of what's going on and in an interview with World Net Daily They publish her work actually you can go and read it She speculates that it was her Trump endorsement and opposition to the idea of a national convention of states Which had roiled her opponents now we had Jerome Corsi of World Net Daily on the show today to speak about this attempted takedown of a conservative icon
[00:39:22.278 --> 00:39:24.219]  We might as well become like Argentina.
[00:39:24.259 --> 00:39:25.959]  We're going to become a banana republic.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.841]  Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and the elite will get rich.
[00:39:29.861 --> 00:39:31.501]  They'll fly around in their jet airplanes.
[00:39:31.521 --> 00:39:33.342]  They'll go to their Lolita Islands.
[00:39:33.822 --> 00:39:35.322]  They'll have all their sex affairs.
[00:39:35.342 --> 00:39:36.743]  They'll have all the drugs they want.
[00:39:37.323 --> 00:39:44.525]  And everybody else will be losing their pension money, struggling desperately to work, not able to afford a house.
[00:39:44.725 --> 00:39:45.806]  And here's their problem though.
[00:39:45.826 --> 00:39:48.106]  They think the military and the police don't know now.
[00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:49.647]  They're actually woken up.
[00:39:50.347 --> 00:39:55.352]  Big time, and aren't going to go along with this while they fly around and jet set while we kill each other in the streets.
[00:39:56.013 --> 00:39:58.115]  Well, and the problem is, look at the border.
[00:39:58.135 --> 00:40:01.219]  The Border Patrol is already saying this is insane.
[00:40:01.259 --> 00:40:03.641]  The Border Patrol is not being permitted to do their job.
[00:40:04.282 --> 00:40:07.585]  And, you know, the economic structure is not going to support this.
[00:40:08.246 --> 00:40:20.649]  We're already at the point where the social welfare systems, the debt levels in the United States and in Europe and around the world are at such extreme levels that these debt-ridden societies are going to collapse.
[00:40:20.709 --> 00:40:25.529]  Dr. Corsi, I want, when we come back from break, to really focus in on the economy, the IMF.
[00:40:25.549 --> 00:40:28.170]  They're all saying what you said five years ago, a month ago.
[00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:31.631]  We're now approaching the big event that Ron Paul and you have talked about.
[00:40:32.151 --> 00:40:37.652]  But shifting gears into fellow Schlafly to kind of show a zoomed-in micro of what's happening.
[00:40:38.112 --> 00:40:39.153]  You heard Stone earlier.
[00:40:39.313 --> 00:40:40.794]  In my experience, he doesn't make stuff up.
[00:40:40.834 --> 00:40:41.835]  It just keeps coming true.
[00:40:42.355 --> 00:40:43.656]  He says he has the sources.
[00:40:43.676 --> 00:40:54.045]  It's confirmed to the highest levels that they attempted to take our organization over that is very influential, very powerful, very successful, with a huge list and a bunch of money.
[00:40:54.785 --> 00:41:01.591]  And to flip it into Cruz, if he has the goods and this comes out, this could be devastating mugging an old lady.
[00:41:02.912 --> 00:41:05.294]  Well, I'll be working on this all afternoon.
[00:41:05.334 --> 00:41:06.855]  It'll be my lead story tomorrow.
[00:41:06.875 --> 00:41:14.522]  I'm going to start off with what Roger Stone just said on your program, that it's orchestrated at the highest levels of the Cruz campaign.
[00:41:14.542 --> 00:41:26.432]  I mean, there's literally millions of dollars, I'm not even sure how much, in the endowments of Ego Forum, that this renegade group, all of which have pledged to Cruz every one of these six
[00:41:27.426 --> 00:41:34.129]  Women who are in the renegade board group have pledged their support to Cruz.
[00:41:34.809 --> 00:41:38.831]  They can control Eagle Forum and depose Phyllis Schlafly.
[00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:41.413]  They can change the mission of the society.
[00:41:41.453 --> 00:41:44.674]  They can grab all the money that's there.
[00:41:44.734 --> 00:41:46.115]  And they're not going to succeed.
[00:41:47.015 --> 00:41:51.337]  Is this a bellwether of the thuggery, the spirit of theft going on?
[00:41:51.357 --> 00:41:54.578]  I'm sorry, go ahead, sir.
[00:41:54.598 --> 00:41:55.419]  You're exactly right.
[00:41:56.399 --> 00:41:57.580]  It's appalling to me.
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:11.406]  Here is a woman who is one of the most respected conservatives in America, who I've known for decades, and who has fundamentally fought to preserve the values of family, God, religion, and our culture.
[00:42:12.006 --> 00:42:13.067]  She's a real feminist.
[00:42:34.086 --> 00:42:37.889]  These are fundamental values that Phyllis has elevated.
[00:42:37.929 --> 00:42:42.673]  These women were brought into would be nothing if it hadn't been for Phyllis Schlafly.
[00:42:43.193 --> 00:42:48.377]  And now even one of them, her daughter, is in this group trying to take over the organization.
[00:42:48.397 --> 00:42:55.402]  I quoted yesterday, Kathy Adams gave this interview in the Dallas Morning News.
[00:42:55.462 --> 00:43:02.528]  She's one of the six board members trying to take over Phyllis Schlafly's organization and basically said that
[00:43:03.228 --> 00:43:06.550]  Phyllis supporting Trump was senile, she'd been manipulated.
[00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:21.337]  It was an absolutely appalling interview for a woman to whom Kathy Adams, for 23 years, has been head of Eagle Forum, I believe in California, and here she's turned on her, on Phyllis.
[00:43:21.897 --> 00:43:22.878]  I mean, it's disgraceful.
[00:43:23.258 --> 00:43:26.480]  Phyllis will not roll over and let this happen.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.623]  She's a constitutional lawyer of the highest order.
[00:43:29.763 --> 00:43:31.364]  She's got a great group behind her.
[00:43:31.384 --> 00:43:33.947]  I think there should be a serious investigation of this.
[00:43:34.387 --> 00:43:35.408]  Well, I think there should too.
[00:43:35.468 --> 00:43:40.352]  And I think, you know, again, it's what price people are paying to back Trump.
[00:43:41.241 --> 00:43:43.382]  Even within the GOP.
[00:43:44.462 --> 00:43:47.023]  Anybody who's backing Trump is going to get turned on.
[00:43:47.443 --> 00:43:50.445]  Buddy, I've never had the pressure I've got on me right now.
[00:43:50.465 --> 00:43:51.145]  It's bad.
[00:43:51.205 --> 00:44:01.769]  And they're going to come after anybody who supports Trump to destroy you in the process or me in the process of WND and Joseph Farah and everything else to try to
[00:44:02.529 --> 00:44:05.730]  You know, promote Cruz, not so Cruz will win.
[00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:11.672]  And this is where the Cruz supporters have to understand they're being used as dupes.
[00:44:12.252 --> 00:44:15.853]  The Republican leadership is in the news admitting that they're going to not have Cruz.
[00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:16.393]  Right.
[00:44:17.053 --> 00:44:20.134]  And the rules of the Republican convention are not going to be fair.
[00:44:20.214 --> 00:44:24.435]  I think, you know, what Roger Stone is saying with votes being stolen.
[00:44:25.035 --> 00:44:30.797]  How can you basically have a primary in a state like Colorado and no one votes?
[00:44:31.557 --> 00:44:35.481]  The GOP is saying this would be a great party except for the voters.
[00:44:35.561 --> 00:44:37.263]  We really don't need the voters.
[00:44:37.323 --> 00:44:38.044]  They're a nuisance.
[00:44:38.865 --> 00:44:43.269]  And Ted Cruz, who should have said, I don't want to win this way.
[00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:45.251]  That would have been the honorable thing.
[00:44:45.732 --> 00:44:48.334]  He's so desperate to get, what, 30-some
[00:44:49.335 --> 00:44:56.937]  Have you heard the clips where he goes and says, I got the vote, it's a democracy, and Drudge won't say that I won Colorado?
[00:44:57.117 --> 00:44:58.037]  Drudge is lying?
[00:44:58.157 --> 00:45:00.058]  Well, that's inverted reality.
[00:45:00.098 --> 00:45:01.418]  That's like crazy town.
[00:45:01.898 --> 00:45:09.220]  And you're seeing now the Ted Cruz, who is the establishment Ted Cruz, who is a product, who is aspiring to be
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:10.600]  A bushy.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.721]  He wanted to be an insider.
[00:45:12.781 --> 00:45:16.223]  He was an insider for years, working at the Federal Trade Commission.
[00:45:16.243 --> 00:45:21.566]  He wasn't liked enough to be given a post as prestigious as his wife had in the White House.
[00:45:22.346 --> 00:45:33.552]  And when Karl Rove would not give Ted Cruz the blessing to be a nominee for the party, that's when Ted Cruz decided he was going to become an evangelist and embrace the Tea Party.
[00:45:34.132 --> 00:45:36.894]  And it's all been fundamentally a lie.
[00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:37.254]  It isn't.
[00:45:37.274 --> 00:45:38.635]  You know, he was for the
[00:45:40.495 --> 00:45:50.440]  He came down to Texas to get his big hat and his cowboy boots and went from being an establishment guy to, I'm the evangelist, I'm the greatest patriot ever, and now he's going back to what he really was.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.581]  Right, and this all was an act.
[00:45:54.295 --> 00:45:55.176]  That's the problem.
[00:45:55.236 --> 00:45:56.297]  It's all an act.
[00:45:56.338 --> 00:46:06.490]  He fundamentally supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, wrote with Ryan an article in the Wall Street Journal to give it the fast-track authority.
[00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:08.412]  Whereas Trump has never been phony.
[00:46:08.452 --> 00:46:13.779]  He's a nationalist, right-wing in some areas, liberal in others, but he's real and that's why they're scared.
[00:46:14.099 --> 00:46:17.241]  Well, and Trump is going to have a fundamental voter realignment.
[00:46:17.702 --> 00:46:22.745]  You're going to find that people from the Democratic Party are equally tired of being lied to.
[00:46:22.826 --> 00:46:35.155]  I mean, how many years are the African Americans going to vote for Democrats who abuse the African Americans, destroy their families, reduce their economic value, the same way with Hispanics?
[00:46:35.615 --> 00:46:37.897]  Democratic Party's going to exploit everybody's votes.
[00:46:37.957 --> 00:46:44.824]  And finally, you're going to see a big crossover of workers across America wanting to preserve jobs.
[00:46:44.844 --> 00:46:45.464]  That's already happening.
[00:46:45.484 --> 00:46:47.586]  He's got double the black votes.
[00:46:48.127 --> 00:46:52.551]  All these Reagan Democrats are coming over blue collar, but they keep saying he can't beat Hillary, but the polls show he will.
[00:46:52.791 --> 00:46:53.652]  That's why they're so scared.
[00:46:53.692 --> 00:46:57.976]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, WND.com senior staff writer, investigative journalist.
[00:47:03.007 --> 00:47:04.009]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:06.833]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.114 --> 00:47:14.966]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:04.957 --> 00:49:06.318]  Well great news everybody.
[00:49:06.538 --> 00:49:19.866]  Philanthropist George Soros has figured out how to deal with this refugee crisis that is of course causing the European Union and other countries to reel under the weight of just what they're going to do.
[00:49:20.306 --> 00:49:27.451]  The billionaire has called for imposing a new debt burden on Europeans to pay for the destruction of their countries.
[00:49:28.251 --> 00:49:31.852]  So, as you all know, we're dealing with the Brexit in the news and all of this.
[00:49:32.172 --> 00:49:33.172]  Should they stay in the EU?
[00:49:33.192 --> 00:49:33.852]  Should they not?
[00:49:33.892 --> 00:49:35.713]  This refugee crisis, they're reeling under it.
[00:49:35.793 --> 00:49:36.773]  And he says, you know what?
[00:49:36.813 --> 00:49:40.454]  You just need to embrace this and throw money at them.
[00:49:40.614 --> 00:49:44.655]  I know that you're teetering on the edge of collapse, but this is the solution for you.
[00:49:45.095 --> 00:49:55.578]  He said EU leaders need to just embrace the idea that effectively addressing the crisis will require surge funding rather than scraping together insufficient funds year after year
[00:49:56.338 --> 00:50:06.581]  And so he's saying, don't just scrape what you can every year, borrow more money.
[00:50:06.601 --> 00:50:25.667]  This country that is teetering on the edge of collapse, he says, increase the value added tax contributions from member states, but borrow more money from the financial markets, thus adding to the debt obligation that has swamped this continent and produced this so-called Eurozone crisis.
[00:50:26.467 --> 00:50:30.370]  Which is causing anemic economic growth and unemployment.
[00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:31.791]  People are very upset.
[00:50:31.811 --> 00:50:32.951]  They're all across the board.
[00:50:32.971 --> 00:50:43.578]  So now you're flooding their country with refugees and giving them a lot more care and welfare benefits than you're giving the actual citizens who are there paying the taxes.
[00:50:43.618 --> 00:50:45.059]  People are rightly pissed off.
[00:50:45.379 --> 00:50:47.160]  But George Soros has a solution for that too.
[00:50:48.041 --> 00:50:51.844]  He is calling on Europeans to pay for that as well.
[00:50:52.244 --> 00:51:02.851]  He wants the Europeans to pay for the anti-immigrant sentiment of the member states, and he's calling for Europeans to pay for the effort to undermine opposition to immigration
[00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:16.719]  And the political elite, because people are really pissed off and so a lot of people are opposing immigration, opposing the globalist trade deals, and rule by unelected authoritarian EU grandees.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:23.744]  So there you go, the whole problem, reaction, solution, and he wants you to pay for the whole damn thing.
[00:51:24.284 --> 00:51:39.429]  Well, how about we just stop indiscriminate killing and war in the Middle East, and then maybe everyone wouldn't be rushing to flee those countries, and at the very least, have them assimilate once they get to the West, and not the other way around, because you know what?
[00:51:39.729 --> 00:51:43.050]  If the West was so bad, why is everyone rushing to get here?
[00:51:46.172 --> 00:51:55.179]  Mahatma Gandhi supposedly once remarked that Western civilization would be a good idea, suggesting that the West was backward and uncivilized.
[00:51:55.339 --> 00:51:57.080]  Well, Gandhi was wrong.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.482]  The West is the best.
[00:51:59.722 --> 00:52:02.084]  Why do you think everyone wants to move here?
[00:52:02.204 --> 00:52:09.089]  But when they do move here, they bring the worst aspects of their own culture with them and create ghettos.
[00:52:09.449 --> 00:52:11.790]  Supplanting the original culture.
[00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:19.252]  The left then supports and encourages these ghettos because they believe in cultural relativism.
[00:52:19.592 --> 00:52:22.173]  This idea that all cultures are equal.
[00:52:22.353 --> 00:52:23.554]  Well, they're not.
[00:52:24.234 --> 00:52:27.715]  Some cultures are clearly better than other cultures.
[00:52:28.776 --> 00:52:35.464]  620 million Indians, half of their population, defecate in public.
[00:52:35.765 --> 00:52:39.729]  UNICEF has to run campaigns teaching them how to use toilets.
[00:52:43.365 --> 00:52:49.810]  Public defecation causes bacterial infections which lead to childhood malnutrition and death.
[00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:54.494]  Indian shitting and pissing in the street is part of their culture.
[00:52:54.614 --> 00:53:02.720]  The government also has to put up signs everywhere telling them not to litter because Indians aren't generally too fussed about cleanliness.
[00:53:02.941 --> 00:53:06.864]  That's why India is widely regarded as a shithole.
[00:53:07.244 --> 00:53:13.208]  Shitting in public also seems to be popular amongst many of the Muslim migrants now arriving in Europe.
[00:53:13.408 --> 00:53:18.591]  Universities and other institutions are also having to teach them how to use toilets properly.
[00:53:18.651 --> 00:53:21.372]  Shitting in public is not acceptable.
[00:53:21.853 --> 00:53:24.414]  I don't care if it's part of your culture.
[00:53:24.815 --> 00:53:27.276]  Shitting in public is bad.
[00:53:27.796 --> 00:53:30.338]  Some cultures are better than others.
[00:53:31.658 --> 00:53:37.261]  In Afghanistan, police officers and military commanders like to rape young boys.
[00:53:37.461 --> 00:53:40.202]  The practice is called Bacha Barzi.
[00:53:40.582 --> 00:53:42.363]  Literally, boy play.
[00:53:42.603 --> 00:53:45.825]  Raping young boys is part of their culture.
[00:53:45.905 --> 00:53:53.568]  When US Marines blew the whistle and tried to intervene, they were told by higher-ups to look the other way because it's quote,
[00:53:54.088 --> 00:53:55.509]  Part of their culture.
[00:53:55.649 --> 00:54:05.116]  The New York Times reported on how US troops in Afghanistan would hear the boys screaming as they were being raped by Afghan police who had brought them on base.
[00:54:05.356 --> 00:54:07.838]  Raping boys is not acceptable.
[00:54:08.318 --> 00:54:11.320]  I don't care if it's part of your culture.
[00:54:11.801 --> 00:54:14.082]  Raping boys is bad.
[00:54:14.723 --> 00:54:17.405]  Some cultures are better than others.
[00:54:17.725 --> 00:54:18.646]  That's racist!
[00:54:18.786 --> 00:54:23.928]  In Israel, Orthodox Jews suck babies' penises.
[00:54:24.108 --> 00:54:32.953]  The practice, known as metzitzah peh, involves rabbis performing oral suction circumcisions on eight-day-old babies.
[00:54:33.073 --> 00:54:38.976]  They suck the baby's penis to cleanse the wound following circumcision.
[00:54:39.076 --> 00:54:40.797]  Sucking babies' penises
[00:54:41.517 --> 00:54:42.999]  Is part of their culture.
[00:54:43.119 --> 00:54:50.966]  The practice has caused 17 cases of infant herpes in New York since the year 2000, including two deaths.
[00:54:51.246 --> 00:54:54.529]  Sucking babies penises is not acceptable.
[00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:57.793]  I don't care if it's part of your culture.
[00:54:58.213 --> 00:55:00.936]  Sucking babies penises is bad.
[00:55:01.516 --> 00:55:04.199]  Some cultures are better than others.
[00:55:05.459 --> 00:55:15.404]  In China, South Korea and Taiwan, people like to eat tiger penises because they think it's a potent aphrodisiac and it prevents erectile dysfunction.
[00:55:15.484 --> 00:55:19.386]  There's no scientific evidence at all to support that claim.
[00:55:19.526 --> 00:55:25.189]  Tiger penis is a delicacy served in restaurants in parts of China and Southeast Asia.
[00:55:25.369 --> 00:55:26.810]  Eating tiger penises
[00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:28.811]  Is part of their culture.
[00:55:28.952 --> 00:55:32.514]  Demand for tiger penises creates a market for poachers.
[00:55:32.735 --> 00:55:39.560]  As Chinese immigration to the West has increased, tiger penis remedies are now available in some European countries.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:48.627]  According to the EIA, one tiger every single day is killed for its use in traditional Chinese medicine.
[00:55:48.707 --> 00:55:50.429]  Tigers are endangered.
[00:55:50.709 --> 00:55:54.313]  There are less than 4,000 tigers left in the wild.
[00:55:54.633 --> 00:56:00.739]  Eating tiger penises based on some bulls**t belief that it's an aphrodisiac is unacceptable.
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:03.982]  I don't care if it's part of your culture.
[00:56:04.443 --> 00:56:07.005]  Eating tiger penises is bad.
[00:56:07.486 --> 00:56:10.369]  Some cultures are better than others.
[00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:16.314]  In Sub-Saharan Africa, there are millions of modern-day slaves.
[00:56:16.594 --> 00:56:20.598]  In India, there are as many as 14 million slaves.
[00:56:20.798 --> 00:56:25.943]  In Mauritania, as many as 20% of the population is enslaved.
[00:56:26.103 --> 00:56:26.623]  Slaves!
[00:56:27.364 --> 00:56:28.964]  People being bought and sold.
[00:56:29.284 --> 00:56:34.246]  People being compelled to perform forced labour under threat of violence.
[00:56:34.526 --> 00:56:41.527]  Even at the height of slavery in the West, only 1.4% of white Americans owned slaves.
[00:56:41.687 --> 00:56:49.009]  But we're still being lectured about how evil we are, despite the fact that the West was the first to end slavery.
[00:56:49.049 --> 00:56:50.169]  Where's the outcry?
[00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:56.171]  Over the 30 million people who are enslaved right now across the world.
[00:56:56.251 --> 00:57:00.112]  But I guess just owning slaves is part of their culture, right?
[00:57:00.232 --> 00:57:02.513]  Slavery is unacceptable.
[00:57:02.973 --> 00:57:05.854]  I don't care if it's part of your culture.
[00:57:06.194 --> 00:57:07.895]  Slavery is bad.
[00:57:08.135 --> 00:57:13.337]  I'm proud to say that it was the West that ended slavery virtually everywhere else.
[00:57:13.757 --> 00:57:18.580]  But it still persists in some parts of Africa and India.
[00:57:19.201 --> 00:57:22.023]  Some cultures are better than others.
[00:57:22.163 --> 00:57:23.164]  That's racist!
[00:57:23.244 --> 00:57:27.246]  Listen, I'm not saying there aren't good things that we can take from other cultures.
[00:57:27.426 --> 00:57:30.889]  And I know that Western culture isn't perfect.
[00:57:31.249 --> 00:57:32.890]  But it's the best we've got.
[00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:45.378]  In terms of individual freedom, economic prosperity, intellectual advancement, technological progress, the arts and medicine, the West provided the blueprint for the ascent of humanity.
[00:57:45.499 --> 00:57:56.366]  The West is also the most tolerant place in the world towards other cultures, and invites them with open arms, even at the risk of obliterating itself.
[00:57:56.486 --> 00:58:01.129]  So why are we constantly browbeaten into being ashamed of the West?
[00:58:01.569 --> 00:58:03.391]  I'm not ashamed of democracy.
[00:58:03.651 --> 00:58:05.513]  I'm not ashamed of the Renaissance.
[00:58:05.753 --> 00:58:07.755]  I'm not ashamed of the Enlightenment.
[00:58:08.135 --> 00:58:11.938]  I'm not ashamed of how the West ended slavery.
[00:58:12.098 --> 00:58:16.362]  I'm not ashamed of coming from the most tolerant place on the planet.
[00:58:16.502 --> 00:58:19.003]  Look at the fruits of Western Civilization.
[00:58:19.403 --> 00:58:27.648]  An increase in health, wealth, comfort, freedom and life expectancy unparalleled in human history.
[00:58:27.728 --> 00:58:35.051]  That's why we shouldn't be ashamed to defend Western Civilization against cultural relativism.
[00:58:35.211 --> 00:58:45.236]  We shouldn't be bullied into sacrificing our own culture and allowing it to be supplanted by inferior cultures in the name of political correctness.
[00:58:45.437 --> 00:58:45.997]  The West
[00:58:46.557 --> 00:58:48.438]  That's it for the show tonight.
[00:58:48.478 --> 00:58:49.939]  We'll see you here tomorrow, 7pm central.
