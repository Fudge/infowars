[00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:13.053]  Big Brother.
[00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:14.754]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:16.615]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:18.075]  You want answers?
[00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:19.756]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:20.376 --> 00:00:24.017]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:24.577 --> 00:00:28.639]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:44.496]  All right, folks, this is going to be a particularly jam-packed broadcast today that you do not want to miss, obviously, with the tragic twin bombings killing 34 people at least in Brussels, Belgium.
[00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:47.598]  This just days after the ringleader...
[00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.251]  of the Paris theater attack that killed over 130 people was captured.
[00:00:55.171 --> 00:01:08.995]  Clearly this is being done so that in case he talks, they can go ahead and carry out operations that they already had planned and use those operations as a smokescreen to escape to the next city or the next country.
[00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:17.117]  And because Muslim areas across Europe are complete no-go zones, they can operate however they want.
[00:01:18.197 --> 00:01:46.435]  Joe Biggs served three clusters in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he said that he never saw such danger and hatred on average, even though he was blown up twice in armored vehicles, hit with shrapnel in a whole bunch of famous battles covered by Rolling Stone and others, Esquire, you name it, that he had a worse sense of danger in Mozambique, a suburb of Brussels, Belgium,
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.522]  Than he had in Iraq or Afghanistan.
[00:01:54.022 --> 00:01:55.022]  Just from the general public.
[00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.403]  And I kept saying, get footage of them running you out.
[00:01:57.423 --> 00:02:01.385]  He goes, you understand they got cars coming at us, people screaming at us out of doorways.
[00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:02.545]  It's super dangerous.
[00:02:03.105 --> 00:02:03.866]  We're getting out of there.
[00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:08.367]  And I had Paul Watson and Joe Biggs over there with a camera crew.
[00:02:10.108 --> 00:02:11.289]  So we got 34 dead.
[00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.369]  ISIS has taken responsibility.
[00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.271]  Donald Trump has shown his geopolitical
[00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:30.391]  Foxiness, in that he told AIPAC yesterday, just hours before this happened, that NATO has been basically backing ISIS and is no friend of Israel.
[00:02:30.872 --> 00:02:31.732]  And that's just true.
[00:02:32.313 --> 00:02:33.214]  How astute.
[00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:40.159]  Hollande, Merkel, France more than anybody, has been backing Al Qaeda and now Islamic State.
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.761]  It's the elephant in the room.
[00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:47.686]  All over the Middle East, all over North Africa, especially Libya and Syria,
[00:02:48.407 --> 00:02:56.996]  And that's what's so frustrating about watching the communist Hollande, the communist Merkel, go, we will stand strong against this terror.
[00:02:57.396 --> 00:03:04.083]  We will keep the emergency going and take all your rights and arrest anybody who's right wing and criticizes Islam.
[00:03:06.522 --> 00:03:11.565]  They bring them in, unvetted, they let them attack, and then they take your rights.
[00:03:12.106 --> 00:03:14.747]  This is the ultimate false flag.
[00:03:15.207 --> 00:03:16.648]  In fact, you guys get buckling in here.
[00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.150]  I meant to shoot a Facebook mentions on this subject right before the show.
[00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:20.631]  I didn't do it.
[00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:21.852]  I'm going to do it during the break.
[00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:23.553]  It's so important to have him loaded up.
[00:03:27.095 --> 00:03:28.596]  Brussels attacks are a false flag.
[00:03:28.636 --> 00:03:32.078]  I want to go with that, that all the enemies and detractors will come in and attack us.
[00:03:32.738 --> 00:03:34.800]  National News will say that I said it didn't happen.
[00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:37.864]  And then everyone will find the truth and millions will watch it.
[00:03:38.504 --> 00:03:39.965]  It's a real Islamic attack.
[00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:50.354]  But when you bring them in and you know they're going to attack and you know a bunch of them are terror cells, then you are aiding and abetting.
[00:03:50.514 --> 00:03:51.475]  It is a false flag.
[00:03:51.515 --> 00:03:58.600]  In fact, guys, there's a whole bunch of British and Dutch and French and German news and also Greek news.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.721]  Please put me on the stories.
[00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:00.402]  I just thought of this.
[00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:09.716]  Where they admitted, quote, over 500 of a known Islamic Sunni terror group have come in just from Greece alone in the last year.
[00:04:09.756 --> 00:04:11.417]  That was a few months ago in mainstream news.
[00:04:12.137 --> 00:04:22.381]  There's a bunch of others that they know that terrorists are coming in with the refugees and they're not vetting them by design, just like Obama won't vet them and won't even look at their ID cards when they come in.
[00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:27.263]  So Trump says we need to check their IDs and stop it until the IDs are checked.
[00:04:28.766 --> 00:04:32.109]  And they call that outrageous and crazy when it's default common sense.
[00:04:32.549 --> 00:04:39.015]  And also Donald Trump warned, we're going to play these clips coming up, of what happened in Belgium and said it's going to happen again.
[00:04:39.075 --> 00:04:40.617]  And they said, how outrageous.
[00:04:42.418 --> 00:04:46.822]  He said there's no-go areas, huge areas of the city where you can't even go.
[00:04:47.938 --> 00:04:50.701]  And our guys went in there with their cameras down, their cameras hidden.
[00:04:51.262 --> 00:04:54.346]  And we're told, get out of restaurants, get out of gas stations, get off the street.
[00:04:54.746 --> 00:04:57.670]  People driving up at them with cars, threatening to kill them.
[00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.133]  And the police won't even go in the areas.
[00:05:00.293 --> 00:05:04.438]  In fact, get the BBC footage ready of the crew being attacked last week in the very city.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:14.483]  Marines across the Corps will be challenged on their unconscious prejudice as women get the opportunity to become grunts for the first time.
[00:05:14.763 --> 00:05:16.664]  ReportsMilitary.com.
[00:05:16.864 --> 00:05:29.669]  The Military Corps is rolling out mandatory training for all Marines before the first future female rifleman hits boot camp, aiming to set conditions for a smooth transition and head off cultural resistance.
[00:05:30.109 --> 00:05:39.717]  Mobile training teams will be dispatched to installations across the Corps throughout May and June to offer a two-day seminar to Majors and Lieutenant Colonels.
[00:05:40.017 --> 00:05:49.965]  Topics include unconscious bias, which focuses on how people prejudge others based on factors such as race and gender, and principles of institutional change.
[00:05:50.365 --> 00:05:59.413]  A survey obtained by the Washington Post found that the majority of male Marines at every rank opposed the decision to have women serve in combat jobs.
[00:05:59.834 --> 00:06:03.664]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[00:06:06.175 --> 00:06:09.397]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:09.697 --> 00:06:17.701]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:17.941 --> 00:06:22.964]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:23.364 --> 00:06:25.645]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:38.762]  We're introducing the best yet.
[00:06:38.882 --> 00:06:42.803]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[00:06:42.943 --> 00:06:47.565]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong powerful flow.
[00:06:47.765 --> 00:06:54.687]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[00:06:57.928 --> 00:06:58.809]  I've been working all day.
[00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:00.890]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.791]  I get in here at 830.
[00:07:01.831 --> 00:07:02.832]  I was kind of run down.
[00:07:02.912 --> 00:07:05.313]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:25.668]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[00:07:25.688 --> 00:07:27.509]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:28.310]  I popped two of them.
[00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.731]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[00:07:30.872 --> 00:07:32.733]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[00:07:32.753 --> 00:07:34.114]  It's got four and a half stars.
[00:07:34.314 --> 00:07:35.375]  People really love it.
[00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:36.176]  Read about it.
[00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:39.999]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:45.363]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[00:07:45.563 --> 00:07:49.425]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[00:07:49.586 --> 00:07:55.389]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[00:07:55.729 --> 00:08:01.653]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:08:17.667 --> 00:08:32.661]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the leading voice globally in the fight for human empowerment against the global technocratic tyranny.
[00:08:33.222 --> 00:08:35.905]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:43.194 --> 00:08:44.575]  We already had Jim Kennedy.
[00:08:45.175 --> 00:08:46.176]  Famous Green Beret.
[00:08:46.996 --> 00:08:48.998]  In the most elite secret army groups there are.
[00:08:49.038 --> 00:08:50.499]  You can imagine who that is.
[00:08:50.659 --> 00:08:51.259]  He didn't tell me.
[00:08:51.299 --> 00:08:52.320]  I just know it.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.060]  Delta Force.
[00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:54.161]  And more.
[00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:59.485]  Will be joining us for a full hour coming up in the third hour today.
[00:08:59.505 --> 00:09:01.126]  He's going to be on for 30 minutes to talk about
[00:09:01.866 --> 00:09:09.552]  Preparedness and citizen training with a sheepdog program and how we've got to get ready to protect ourselves during the collapse of society.
[00:09:10.312 --> 00:09:21.561]  But he's going to be coming in earlier today to obviously talk about the situation with the attacks in Brussels, Belgium, Molambique, one of the suburbs, and other areas.
[00:09:22.742 --> 00:09:26.605]  Our crew, people like Joe Biggs,
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.044]  And Paul Joseph Watson from London were there just a few months ago.
[00:09:32.284 --> 00:09:36.367]  They got there within a day and a half, two days of the attacks in Paris.
[00:09:36.748 --> 00:09:44.194]  They went into Brussels, Belgium, just an hour and a half away from Paris, inside Belgium, and they could not even go into
[00:09:45.649 --> 00:09:46.849]  Many areas of the city.
[00:09:47.109 --> 00:09:52.991]  Couldn't go in a gas station, couldn't go into a five and dime, a drug store, couldn't get service at a restaurant.
[00:09:53.351 --> 00:09:58.672]  They would walk in, Muslim men would jump up and scream, you're not welcome, get out, and begin pushing them out.
[00:09:59.052 --> 00:10:01.273]  They would begin trying to ram them with cars.
[00:10:01.633 --> 00:10:05.894]  They would begin just screaming and yelling that they're basically going to kill them in Arabic.
[00:10:06.374 --> 00:10:20.120]  And Joe said three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, blown up twice in armored vehicles, hit with shrapnel repeatedly, that it was the most intense hatred he ever felt because most people in Afghanistan and Iraq did not hate them.
[00:10:21.401 --> 00:10:29.184]  Who has been brought into Europe are exclusively hardcore Wahhabist financed by Saudi Arabia.
[00:10:29.204 --> 00:10:31.065]  We're going to go through all of this today.
[00:10:33.186 --> 00:10:34.487]  Hardcore radicals.
[00:10:36.397 --> 00:10:39.700]  And actually, if you go, Paul Watson interviewed her just a few days ago in the fourth hour.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:49.568]  If you go to Syrian Girl's page, she has mainstream news articles documenting that the majority of people coming into Syria are invaders to take the nation over.
[00:10:49.889 --> 00:10:52.131]  They've had their butt kicked by the Russians, that's admitted.
[00:10:52.791 --> 00:11:04.198]  They're now going through Turkey, who trained them, into Europe and being placed as sleeper cells by Hollande and by Merkel and also by the leaders of Brussels.
[00:11:04.579 --> 00:11:09.502]  They have declared martial law in Germany, martial law in France.
[00:11:10.142 --> 00:11:19.268]  They call it a permanent civil emergency, banning free speech and arresting nationalist mainline leaders who aren't even as hardcore as Donald Trump.
[00:11:20.498 --> 00:11:22.259]  So, guns are everywhere.
[00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:25.701]  You can get a gun easier in Brussels, Belgium than probably anywhere in Europe.
[00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:30.043]  The jihadists run around, you've seen the videos, nightly shooting their guns in the air.
[00:11:30.363 --> 00:11:33.124]  The police are ordered by the government to stand down.
[00:11:33.784 --> 00:11:38.127]  We aired footage yesterday, in fact, let's cue it up, of a BBC crew.
[00:11:38.147 --> 00:11:44.390]  We'll even play some of the audio for Radiolisters, but obviously it is in, I guess they speak Flemish there.
[00:11:46.432 --> 00:11:52.315]  And this is the BBC at the train station that was attacked, by the way, one of the nearby train stations.
[00:11:53.856 --> 00:11:54.597]  This is 60 Minutes.
[00:11:54.637 --> 00:11:55.837]  There's also BBC footage.
[00:11:56.357 --> 00:12:03.461]  And they're beating up the camera people, throwing rocks at them and attacking them because Europeans are not allowed.
[00:12:03.721 --> 00:12:04.602]  Women are attacked.
[00:12:05.082 --> 00:12:07.764]  People on wheelchairs are attacked in the video.
[00:12:09.384 --> 00:12:19.107]  This is the total, abject, complete, arrogant, hatred of radical Islam, merged with leftist brainwashing and entitlement.
[00:12:19.127 --> 00:12:21.168]  So this is the leftist 60 Minutes people being attacked.
[00:12:21.368 --> 00:12:23.229]  This is the very area being attacked.
[00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:39.812]  And again, they're not allowed to have Oktoberfest.
[00:12:39.832 --> 00:12:41.093]  They're not allowed to wear skirts.
[00:12:41.133 --> 00:12:43.394]  They tell German women, do not wear skirts.
[00:12:43.514 --> 00:12:44.715]  If they are, they are attacked.
[00:12:45.376 --> 00:12:53.921]  They are bringing in radical jihadists by the millions from areas taken by them in Libya and in Syria.
[00:12:54.781 --> 00:13:04.247]  It is all over the news that millions of invaders, including with their families, have come in behind the ISIS-Al Qaeda jihadists Saudi Arabia funded
[00:13:05.109 --> 00:13:08.591]  And NATO supported to invade the entire area.
[00:13:09.492 --> 00:13:30.946]  And NATO and the globalists think we are so dumb that we don't know that France quarterbacked the entire operation with Merkel, setting this up in the last five years, advertising that they could come to Germany and to France and to Brussels, Belgium and other areas and get free welfare, get everything.
[00:13:31.286 --> 00:13:33.808]  It's on video scores of times in Germany,
[00:13:34.568 --> 00:13:47.694]  And in other, Sweden, you name it, the social workers come with free money and food, and even when they're beat up and raped, they go on the news and apologize for the racism of Europe and say, thank you for raping me.
[00:13:48.075 --> 00:13:49.195]  That's actually in the news.
[00:13:49.455 --> 00:13:50.356]  We've covered the stories.
[00:13:50.976 --> 00:13:54.658]  They come with flowers to be beaten and attacked, thanking them.
[00:13:55.378 --> 00:14:02.962]  This is the total self-loathing, anti-European, psycho hate that has been bred into them at the universities.
[00:14:04.119 --> 00:14:08.282]  And this is society committing suicide in front of everyone.
[00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:26.815]  Just like we played the video yesterday at Trump Tower with a, quote, transgender man who's become a woman attacking the police, attacking the horses, the rest of them screaming epitaphs with Muslims wearing headdresses standing with him.
[00:14:27.636 --> 00:14:28.877]  In a Muslim country.
[00:14:29.853 --> 00:14:37.321]  Almost every Muslim country, unless it was Jordan or Egypt, they would stone that man, that woman, to death.
[00:14:38.902 --> 00:14:42.286]  They would tear them apart limb from limb.
[00:14:42.546 --> 00:14:43.848]  They would crucify them.
[00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:46.650]  They don't care.
[00:14:47.972 --> 00:14:51.736]  They know radical Islam, which is becoming the dominant takeover system,
[00:14:53.243 --> 00:14:54.843]  Absolutely hates the West.
[00:14:55.463 --> 00:15:00.224]  And they are the muscle they want in here to organize the takedown.
[00:15:00.644 --> 00:15:03.565]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have an investigative reporter in the field right now.
[00:15:03.585 --> 00:15:04.405]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:15:05.265 --> 00:15:06.465]  And it should be breaking next week.
[00:15:09.886 --> 00:15:14.567]  Dealing with jihadis brought in from North Africa and the Middle East.
[00:15:15.407 --> 00:15:20.328]  Citizens in Section 8 housing, Hispanic, black and white, being thrown out.
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.443]  For minor violations like a flat tire or a barbecue pit outside.
[00:15:26.345 --> 00:15:32.430]  So they can move 20 to 30 to 40 people into one or two room apartments from North Africa, from the Middle East.
[00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.813]  And they are jihadis threatening the staff.
[00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:36.694]  People are quitting.
[00:15:37.235 --> 00:15:42.299]  They are giving them fake, well they're real, social security numbers with fake names.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.642]  They're giving them new identities like the Witness Protection Program.
[00:15:46.483 --> 00:16:03.251]  Under Homeland Security orders, just like they ship illegals in from Mexico and quote complete the smuggling process, just like they fly people into Dallas and LA and New York City, plane loads of 140, 150 people every day and no IDs are checked.
[00:16:04.532 --> 00:16:07.193]  Because they're bringing sleeper cells in.
[00:16:08.394 --> 00:16:10.215]  That is the final takeover plan.
[00:16:10.315 --> 00:16:14.137]  It's very clear now to hit every town, every city, and when they do,
[00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:36.989]  They will declare civil emergency against everyone, ban everybody's free speech, and bring in a permanent emergency now being beta tested in Europe, and the political elite think we're so dumb that when a Donald Trump comes out and says, Brussels, Belgium, one of the most beautiful places in the world, you can't go in half the city, they'll beat you up and attack you if you do.
[00:16:38.274 --> 00:16:43.618]  And they are in liberal, globalist publications today, Time Magazine, Newsweek, you name it.
[00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:49.063]  I've got stacks of the articles attacking Donald Trump, saying, can you believe him?
[00:16:49.603 --> 00:16:50.864]  Whoa, he's over the top!
[00:16:52.105 --> 00:16:55.668]  He said it's Muslims that did this in Europe today.
[00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:57.469]  Can you believe his hate?
[00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.472]  They were saying that after ISIS took credit.
[00:17:03.534 --> 00:17:04.855]  You go, well, that's discrediting to them.
[00:17:04.975 --> 00:17:07.217]  No, no, no, no, not to their cult followers.
[00:17:09.807 --> 00:17:12.427]  These people are enemies of this country, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:12.688 --> 00:17:13.628]  They are allied.
[00:17:13.688 --> 00:17:17.488]  The megabanks, George Soros is allied with radical jihadists.
[00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:21.769]  Google funded the Arab Spring, put Al-Qaeda, ISIS in charge.
[00:17:22.229 --> 00:17:26.590]  Apple, Facebook, Zuckerberg, Twitter all met, I told you years ago.
[00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.071]  We went to England to show you where they secretly met.
[00:17:29.351 --> 00:17:33.811]  It was in the Associated Press yesterday that they ran the operations.
[00:17:34.212 --> 00:17:36.572]  We know what we're talking about.
[00:17:39.113 --> 00:17:44.015]  That's the reason Army Special Forces Command listens to us and this show.
[00:17:45.296 --> 00:17:47.757]  That's the reason people in Congress listen to this show.
[00:17:47.997 --> 00:17:49.598]  It's the reason foreign leaders listen to this show.
[00:17:49.818 --> 00:17:52.759]  Because we know exactly what's going on and we'll talk about it.
[00:17:52.879 --> 00:17:53.840]  But we're not the only ones.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.340]  This stuff is hidden in plain view.
[00:17:58.222 --> 00:18:00.843]  The elite that are still pro-West, pro-America,
[00:18:02.739 --> 00:18:07.122]  And by elite, I mean the good, hard-working, strong defenders of this country and the world.
[00:18:07.423 --> 00:18:10.745]  They listen to this broadcast because they already know what we're talking about.
[00:18:11.205 --> 00:18:16.029]  They just use it to bounce ideas off of because it's the one place they can tune in and actually hear what's going on.
[00:18:16.329 --> 00:18:21.193]  Why do you think Donald Trump told AIPAC yesterday, hey listen, NATO doesn't like Israel and you know it.
[00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:25.056]  And AIPAC went from booing him to clapping going, wow!
[00:18:25.576 --> 00:18:30.260]  Because Israel knows that NATO has been funding ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.743]  And Israel also knows some elements of the Israeli government have been part of that as well.
[00:18:36.344 --> 00:18:38.986]  Ted Cruz comes out and says Trump is crazy.
[00:18:39.726 --> 00:18:44.310]  How dare him say we shouldn't be so close to NATO because they're working with ISIS.
[00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:52.075]  It's a fact that NATO, headed up by France and Turkey mainly, ran the ISIS and Al Qaeda takeover.
[00:18:52.395 --> 00:18:53.576]  It's a fact!
[00:18:55.077 --> 00:18:56.578]  It's been in congressional hearings.
[00:18:56.959 --> 00:19:00.081]  Ted Cruz valiantly talked about it three years ago.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.220]  But not anymore!
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.322]  He thinks his constituents are stupid, and he can get points against Trump for telling the truth.
[00:19:09.902 --> 00:19:11.522]  Now when we come back, I'm going to play this clip.
[00:19:11.882 --> 00:19:15.223]  Trump warned back in January, Brussels wasn't Islamists' hellhole.
[00:19:16.524 --> 00:19:18.384]  Donald Trump warned Brussels months ago.
[00:19:18.404 --> 00:19:19.484]  We're going to play those clips.
[00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:24.046]  AIPAC cheers Trump thrashing Obama, criticizing NATO.
[00:19:24.646 --> 00:19:27.666]  Ted Cruz attacks Donald Trump over Brussels, Jihadist attacks.
[00:19:29.027 --> 00:19:29.447]  Then we got
[00:19:30.868 --> 00:19:32.410]  Tim Kennedy coming in studio.
[00:19:34.232 --> 00:19:36.714]  To talk about it in the third hour, we have Joe Biggs.
[00:19:37.918 --> 00:20:04.516]  from the studio and Paul Joseph Watson from our studios in London joining us because they were both there in Brussels less than two days just about a day and a half after the attacks and they went in they were there when the police first raided one house and killed one of the terrorists who had a suicide vest and these are real terror attacks but the globalists are opening the door up and bringing them in so it is a false flag stay with us ladies and gentlemen
[00:20:06.485 --> 00:20:07.765]  Suffering from illness or disease?
[00:20:07.905 --> 00:20:08.725]  Frequently in pain?
[00:20:08.825 --> 00:20:09.406]  Over-stressed?

[00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:36.554]  This is Sharon Hunt.
[00:21:36.875 --> 00:21:40.296]  Before using Heart and Body Extract, my energy level was very, very low.
[00:21:40.757 --> 00:21:43.638]  I could only walk a few feet and then would have to sit down.
[00:21:43.998 --> 00:21:52.823]  I was tired and lethargic, but after taking Heart and Body Extract, my energy level has improved greatly and I can now walk longer distances without getting tired so fast.

[00:22:05.327 --> 00:22:08.812]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:22:09.553 --> 00:22:10.054]  It's true.
[00:22:10.174 --> 00:22:14.120]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.183]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:22:16.724 --> 00:22:21.211]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:42.332]  If you want to raise the next generation of patriot leaders, take a look at Freedom Project Academy, a Judeo-Christian online school for kindergarten through high school.
[00:23:42.632 --> 00:23:45.153]  No common core teaching methods or high-stakes testing.

[00:24:14.424 --> 00:24:18.727]  Even a five-year-old could see the setup.
[00:24:18.748 --> 00:24:21.410]  It's so outrageous.
[00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:22.491]  It's so over-the-top.
[00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:23.372]  It's so brazen.
[00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:26.975]  It's so hidden in plain view.
[00:24:29.678 --> 00:24:31.399]  Look at this headline from the Daily Mail.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.881]  This is from
[00:24:35.305 --> 00:24:42.787]  February 18th, 2015, before the giant migrant wave came in, the second wave into Europe.
[00:24:44.007 --> 00:24:44.787]  And look at the headline.
[00:24:45.387 --> 00:24:56.630]  ISIS threatens to send 500,000 migrants to Europe as a psychological weapon and chilling echo of Qaddafi's prophecy that the Mediterranean will be a sea of chaos.
[00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:59.731]  They sent 2 million in the next year, not 500,000.
[00:25:02.193 --> 00:25:05.036]  And they went on to say, we'll have sleeper cells inside of them.
[00:25:06.658 --> 00:25:16.889]  Donald Trump, six, seven months later, when there was an attack in Paris, said, we know terrorists are coming in with the refugees.
[00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:18.971]  ISIS said they would use them.
[00:25:22.235 --> 00:25:24.117]  And there were all those other attacks across Europe.
[00:25:25.438 --> 00:25:27.419]  And they said, oh, he's crazy, he's horrible.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.440]  It's not true.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:37.086]  And I have stacks of articles since then where they admit terrorists are coming in, and most of them, 80 plus percent, are military-age men.
[00:25:37.106 --> 00:25:43.890]  Now, correction, because I tend to conflate things, that is, mix things together.
[00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:46.592]  It was 60 Minutes Australia.
[00:25:49.677 --> 00:26:00.043]  In Stockholm, Sweden, that was attacked last week, and it was a Russian film crew attacked there in Brussels, Belgium.
[00:26:00.283 --> 00:26:02.784]  There's just so many of these, I tend to mix them all together.
[00:26:02.824 --> 00:26:12.249]  The point is, refugee aid groups, you name it, every day I see a new video of refugee aid groups trying to bring food or whatever to these people, and they just beat them up.
[00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.191]  Or it's all over the news that citizens in Germany
[00:26:16.018 --> 00:26:21.180]  From Cologne to Paris, France, can't go to many of the train terminals without being beaten up.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:26.483]  And that's what's happening in Sweden, and in Germany, and in Austria, and just everywhere.
[00:26:28.264 --> 00:26:30.665]  And the quote, migrants are beating each other up as well.
[00:26:30.765 --> 00:26:33.106]  It's just crazy lawlessness.
[00:26:33.146 --> 00:26:33.906]  Just go to YouTube.
[00:26:35.167 --> 00:26:38.989]  Type in migrants or refugees, you know, robbing drivers.
[00:26:42.819 --> 00:26:47.543]  And they just rob drivers and rob 18-wheelers and just take over the channel.
[00:26:47.563 --> 00:26:52.288]  And it was in the news last week, the police don't even stop them now in England.
[00:26:52.608 --> 00:26:54.710]  There were, what, five arrests last year.
[00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:58.694]  As thousands a day just run through, the police sit there.
[00:26:59.094 --> 00:27:04.659]  Should have a photo of an obese police officer in the newspaper, just sitting there while this is happening.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.821]  This is a government order.
[00:27:07.222 --> 00:27:08.463]  This is a takeover.
[00:27:10.094 --> 00:27:14.878]  If you're a radio listener, I'm showing all the articles and showing the photos and video.
[00:27:15.898 --> 00:27:20.021]  The crew is on TV right now at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:27:21.442 --> 00:27:23.744]  And we are dominantly a radio broadcast.
[00:27:23.784 --> 00:27:25.165]  That's where we have the bulk of our audience.
[00:27:25.185 --> 00:27:29.629]  But more and more of it's TV because I need to be able to show people this stuff or they wouldn't believe it.
[00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:33.451]  It is unbelievable.
[00:27:33.551 --> 00:27:33.872]  And now,
[00:27:35.626 --> 00:27:47.414]  34 plus, because the number's growing by the hour, hundreds wounded in two attacks as terrorists remain at large and as ISIS takes responsibility within 30 minutes.
[00:27:47.574 --> 00:27:48.835]  I got up at 7 a.m.
[00:27:48.875 --> 00:27:51.577]  this morning, got up, and Paul Watson had already written an article.
[00:27:51.597 --> 00:27:52.858]  It happened a few hours before that.
[00:27:52.878 --> 00:27:56.961]  Because he's up six hours earlier in the UK.
[00:27:59.537 --> 00:28:03.879]  And then I went to Google and typed in Donald Trump, and guess what I saw?
[00:28:04.379 --> 00:28:07.160]  Three of the ten or so articles at the top.
[00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:13.883]  Trump already blaming Muslims and immigration for terror attacks.
[00:28:14.884 --> 00:28:18.225]  And they go on in these articles to act like, did you hear what Trump said?
[00:28:18.285 --> 00:28:20.966]  He claimed that women wear lipstick.
[00:28:21.387 --> 00:28:26.569]  Did you hear Trump claimed that men have
[00:28:29.622 --> 00:28:30.063]  Just here.
[00:28:30.904 --> 00:28:48.304]  I mean, he's just saying things that are known fact, but the media wants to act like it's crazy and weird, so the left sees that, has their minute of hate, and then doesn't care when it comes out it's Muslims five minutes later, because they just want to hate Donald Trump.
[00:28:50.606 --> 00:28:55.787]  Because, you know, he's into sovereignty and prosperity and lower taxes and controlling our borders.
[00:28:55.847 --> 00:28:58.148]  What a horrible, horrible, horrible man.
[00:28:58.368 --> 00:29:01.809]  He was against attacking Syria and putting Al-Qaeda and ISIS in charge.
[00:29:03.969 --> 00:29:05.310]  Isn't that just special?
[00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:11.931]  So when we come back, we'll talk to Paul Watson from London, Joe Biggs from right here in the Situation Room.
[00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:13.472]  I'm here broadcasting from the War Room.
[00:29:14.735 --> 00:29:16.536]  You want to be able to see all these articles and videos?
[00:29:17.137 --> 00:29:19.579]  Or send your friends and family to the link so they can see it for themselves?
[00:29:20.059 --> 00:29:22.301]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:29:23.602 --> 00:29:25.743]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:29:26.043 --> 00:29:32.268]  And also want to invite our local AM and FM affiliates across the country to do what UHF and VHF TV and cable stations are doing.
[00:29:32.588 --> 00:29:36.031]  Just grab our video feed and put it on your own station site.
[00:29:36.831 --> 00:29:38.313]  And then plug folks can also get on...
[00:29:39.224 --> 00:29:43.426]  Augmented information there, because people need to see this for themselves.
[00:29:43.747 --> 00:29:46.128]  I know hardcore listeners go check the site, see the videos.
[00:29:46.488 --> 00:29:49.530]  You know I'm telling the truth, but for the average radio listener, they're hearing this.
[00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.691]  They need to see what I was just saying.
[00:29:51.751 --> 00:29:53.672]  It's the only way to save this republic.
[00:29:53.912 --> 00:29:55.673]  This isn't... This is a war, folks.
[00:29:55.753 --> 00:29:56.654]  We're on the march.
[00:29:57.134 --> 00:29:58.735]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:59.655 --> 00:30:02.337]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:06.394 --> 00:30:14.557]  Marines across the Corps will be challenged on their unconscious prejudice as women get the opportunity to become grunts for the first time.
[00:30:14.817 --> 00:30:16.718]  ReportsMilitary.com.
[00:30:16.938 --> 00:30:29.723]  The Military Corps is rolling out mandatory training for all Marines before the first future female rifleman hits boot camp, aiming to set conditions for a smooth transition and head off cultural resistance.
[00:30:30.183 --> 00:30:39.769]  Mobile training teams will be dispatched to installations across the Corps throughout May and June to offer a two-day seminar to Majors and Lieutenant Colonels.
[00:30:40.089 --> 00:30:50.015]  Topics include unconscious bias, which focuses on how people prejudge others based on factors such as race and gender, and principles of institutional change.
[00:30:50.435 --> 00:30:59.461]  A survey obtained by the Washington Post found that the majority of male Marines at every rank opposed the decision to have women serve in combat jobs.
[00:30:59.901 --> 00:31:03.783]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:31:06.345 --> 00:31:12.729]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.282]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[00:31:16.582 --> 00:31:22.647]  Needed to get my digestive system working correctly again, so I stumbled on the X2.
[00:31:22.707 --> 00:31:26.129]  We look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2.
[00:31:26.329 --> 00:31:29.912]  It's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[00:31:30.212 --> 00:31:31.933]  I needed a detox, basically.
[00:31:36.945 --> 00:31:40.407]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[00:31:40.587 --> 00:31:41.647]  What do you have to lose?
[00:31:41.927 --> 00:31:50.491]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[00:31:50.936 --> 00:31:54.760]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.301]  I was like really more natural.
[00:31:56.581 --> 00:32:01.606]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:32:06.335 --> 00:32:12.761]  Uh, yeah, Alex, first of all, I want to say, Secret 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[00:32:12.821 --> 00:32:13.702]  I use them all.
[00:32:13.782 --> 00:32:14.723]  They're phenomenal.
[00:32:14.763 --> 00:32:15.263]  They work.
[00:32:15.503 --> 00:32:16.264]  Buy them, folks.
[00:32:16.344 --> 00:32:16.705]  Thank you, brother.
[00:32:16.725 --> 00:32:18.726]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[00:32:18.746 --> 00:32:24.632]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[00:32:24.692 --> 00:32:26.914]  Um... Welcome to the Info War.
[00:32:26.974 --> 00:32:32.379]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War at the same time.
[00:32:32.819 --> 00:32:33.520]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:37.403]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, QFX, nascent iodine.
[00:32:37.443 --> 00:32:38.183]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:32:38.223 --> 00:32:39.104]  Have they worked for you?
[00:32:39.244 --> 00:32:41.786]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[00:32:42.107 --> 00:32:43.167]  What products are you taking?
[00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:51.414]  Everything from Super Male to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA Force.
[00:32:51.494 --> 00:32:54.937]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[00:32:55.097 --> 00:32:59.961]  Visit Infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[00:33:00.141 --> 00:33:02.122]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:02.223 --> 00:33:03.323]  We are on the march.
[00:33:03.423 --> 00:33:04.805]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:09.808 --> 00:33:19.276]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:31.207 --> 00:33:36.529]  Almost a year ago, Kit Daniels wrote this article that he's flashed back today up on InfoWars.com.
[00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:44.252]  Brussels called ISIS capital of Europe, police won't enter jihad ghettos.
[00:33:45.293 --> 00:33:56.197]  We will become an Islamic state, Brussels politician says, as the left in Europe openly calls for using Islam as the muscle to bring in communism and socialism.
[00:33:57.119 --> 00:34:14.530]  And everywhere you go, you see bizarro, sick freaks with red flags calling for the death of people that live at Donald Trump towers on video, that video's on Infowars.com, and other bizarre behavior with Muslims with them out there protesting.
[00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:26.233]  And you'll have all these, quote, gay and transgender groups out there, when again, the radical Muslims would kill you in 30 seconds.
[00:34:26.273 --> 00:34:29.715]  They would stone you to death, or chop your head off, or crucify you.
[00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:42.940]  The people that George Soros put in charge of places like Egypt, on video, threw thousands of gay men off buildings to kill them.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:57.888]  George Soros and Google and Facebook and Twitter, on record, five years ago, funded billions for the Arab Spring to not have liberal pro-Western governments come in, and by liberal I mean truly liberal, freedom.
[00:34:59.049 --> 00:35:05.992]  Instead, the left funded hardcore Wahhabis funded by Saudi Arabia to come in and murder everyone.
[00:35:07.853 --> 00:35:13.536]  If you're a radio listener, they're putting articles backing up everything I'm saying on TV, throwing gay men off buildings, okay?
[00:35:14.628 --> 00:35:17.349]  Again, I just want to point out, these people are not liberals, folks.
[00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:20.169]  I don't want to kill anybody, unless they're attacking me.
[00:35:21.449 --> 00:35:22.730]  I don't hate people that are gay.
[00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:29.931]  I hate the fact that they want my guns, they say my kids belong to them, and that I'm hateful because I want to be independent.
[00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:37.313]  And because I don't want 5 million radical Islamists that's brought in, like Europe's done, to run around and boss me around.
[00:35:37.913 --> 00:35:42.414]  We have areas of Austin now going under Sharia law, we have the footage, it's breaking next week, okay?
[00:35:42.634 --> 00:35:44.174]  I have stuff that's going to be nationwide news.
[00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.351]  My alma mater has 230 people from Syria and Iraq brought in last year.
[00:35:53.572 --> 00:35:54.252]  We had an idea.
[00:35:54.292 --> 00:35:55.492]  Why don't we track where they live?
[00:35:55.612 --> 00:35:56.193]  Oh, we did.
[00:35:56.473 --> 00:35:57.333]  Guess what we found?
[00:35:58.153 --> 00:35:58.793]  It's incredible.
[00:36:00.514 --> 00:36:02.694]  This is a total takeover, folks.
[00:36:03.435 --> 00:36:04.215]  It's worse than we know.
[00:36:04.235 --> 00:36:05.595]  Obama keeps the numbers secret.
[00:36:07.456 --> 00:36:08.256]  But here's the article.
[00:36:08.536 --> 00:36:13.858]  ISIS threatens to send 500,000 migrants to Europe as a psychological weapon in Schilling Echo,
[00:36:15.586 --> 00:36:18.969]  Of Gaddafi's prophecy that the Mediterranean will become a sea of chaos.
[00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:24.033]  They've declared civil emergencies in three different European countries.
[00:36:24.053 --> 00:36:27.156]  That is martial law.
[00:36:27.576 --> 00:36:30.979]  They are using the people they brought in to take Europeans' freedom.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:42.749]  Hollande, Merkel, and others are captaining, shepherding, aiding, abetting, giving succor, giving shelter.
[00:36:43.817 --> 00:36:53.902]  Giving material support to Al-Qaeda slice, ISIS, Saudi Arabia, slash Turkey terror jihad groups.
[00:36:55.363 --> 00:36:59.345]  It is on record that they tried to take over Syria with these people.
[00:36:59.605 --> 00:37:01.646]  They got defeated by the Russian-Syrian coalition.
[00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:10.571]  Turkey is giving them entrance into Turkey, but ordering them to travel on the highways out into Eastern Europe.
[00:37:12.008 --> 00:37:13.809]  Germany says come to mama.
[00:37:17.412 --> 00:37:22.075]  Now, this is a coordinated plan in America and in Europe.
[00:37:23.836 --> 00:37:25.558]  This is the ultimate false flag.
[00:37:25.678 --> 00:37:29.881]  False flag simply means you can allow something to happen and then capitalize on it.
[00:37:30.441 --> 00:37:34.424]  You can advertise, you can open the gates, you can let people in, you can give them welfare.
[00:37:35.996 --> 00:37:48.092]  And the word is, and we told you this, San Bernardino, the Paris attacks, the other attacks they try to cover up, are beta test for when they start shooting down the jet airliners from Benghazi, giving them the Stinger missiles.
[00:37:49.983 --> 00:37:53.644]  That if they've got a million here in the US, let's say 5% are terrorists.
[00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:56.265]  We're talking about thousands of sleeper cells.
[00:37:56.945 --> 00:37:59.266]  And in Europe, there's 5 million brought in the last three years.
[00:37:59.806 --> 00:38:01.547]  Let's say 5% are actual operatives.
[00:38:01.607 --> 00:38:03.188]  That's tens of thousands.
[00:38:03.608 --> 00:38:06.969]  We're talking about total shutdown of society.
[00:38:07.149 --> 00:38:08.890]  The stock market's already plunging in Europe.
[00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.230]  Flights are cancelled going into Belgium right now.
[00:38:11.471 --> 00:38:15.812]  Can you imagine what thousands of activated attacks will do?
[00:38:16.852 --> 00:38:17.993]  And then the very people
[00:38:19.383 --> 00:38:37.075]  That brought these globalists in, these operatives, are going to take our rights and claim it's our problem, and the civil unrest that comes out of it, the mainstream media is going to blame anybody, including Joe Biggs, or Tim Kennedy, or Alex Jones, or Matt Drudge, or Donald Trump.
[00:38:39.997 --> 00:38:41.698]  And the military, by the way, knows.
[00:38:42.599 --> 00:38:45.041]  Sure, the military can be a tool of the globalists to dominate and control us.
[00:38:46.954 --> 00:38:51.095]  But because they have the decompartmentalization, that's one of the most awake groups out there.
[00:38:51.115 --> 00:38:55.577]  Believe me, I don't know military that isn't some new grunt that isn't awake.
[00:38:55.857 --> 00:38:58.878]  We're going to go to Joe Biggs and Paul Watson here in just a moment.
[00:38:58.918 --> 00:39:00.158]  Paul Watson from London First.
[00:39:00.818 --> 00:39:02.759]  We've got Tucker Carlson already scheduled on the show.
[00:39:02.779 --> 00:39:04.159]  I'm sure he'll be able to speak to this.
[00:39:04.599 --> 00:39:07.680]  Tim Kennedy, I will be able to speak to it in detail, obviously.
[00:39:08.681 --> 00:39:12.982]  He texted me this morning and he said, London is next.
[00:39:14.761 --> 00:39:15.582]  And then the US.
[00:39:16.623 --> 00:39:18.804]  And that's what's going on here, folks.
[00:39:18.864 --> 00:39:23.929]  So understand, the media misrepresents and claims I'm saying there is an Islamic terror, there is an Islamic threat.
[00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:26.611]  All at the same time claiming I'm Islamophobic.
[00:39:27.211 --> 00:39:29.053]  Yes, I am radical jihad-o-phobic.
[00:39:29.093 --> 00:39:30.834]  I don't want to have my head cut off or my kids blown up.
[00:39:31.155 --> 00:39:31.635]  Absolutely.
[00:39:32.396 --> 00:39:33.577]  We've been threatened by these people.
[00:39:33.617 --> 00:39:35.078]  Joe Biggs has been threatened in their videos.
[00:39:35.438 --> 00:39:36.859]  They threatened to come to Kennedy's house.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.361]  This is the type of trash we're talking about.
[00:39:40.662 --> 00:39:43.725]  Cowardly filth that kills men, women, and children who are unarmed.
[00:39:45.814 --> 00:39:51.499]  And people are saying, well, wait a minute, you said 9-11 was staged with Saudi Arabia and the globalists, not our whole government, to take our liberties.
[00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:52.801]  Now it's 10 times worse.
[00:39:53.041 --> 00:39:54.442]  They're bringing in real attackers.
[00:39:55.083 --> 00:39:56.544]  This is the ultimate false flag.
[00:39:56.764 --> 00:40:00.928]  I'm going to ask Paul Watson about that, the tactical info from Biggs on what he thinks is coming next.
[00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:10.337]  Before we go to those guys, please remember we're listeners supported and we're running a special throughout next week, throughout next Monday, that is the biggest special ever.
[00:40:12.083 --> 00:40:13.064]  On the Deep Cleanse.
[00:40:13.324 --> 00:40:15.245]  We have 10% off Liver Shield.
[00:40:15.265 --> 00:40:17.706]  It opens up the liver in over a week.
[00:40:18.486 --> 00:40:20.087]  Just amazing non-concentrated herbs.
[00:40:20.987 --> 00:40:22.108]  You can get 10% off on that.
[00:40:22.128 --> 00:40:24.989]  15% off when you get it with Ultimate Cleanse Pack.
[00:40:25.049 --> 00:40:26.570]  Liver Shield and Deep Cleanse together.
[00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.331]  15% off.
[00:40:27.711 --> 00:40:29.992]  Or 20% off to get everything you need in the Deep Cleanse.
[00:40:30.532 --> 00:40:33.974]  Ultimate Cleanse Pack, Oxy Powder, Liver Shield, Deep Cleanse.
[00:40:35.168 --> 00:40:39.971]  Twenty percent off, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm telling you, I'm doing the cleanse right now.
[00:40:40.652 --> 00:40:45.195]  You just take it with apple cider vinegar mixed with water, a few ounces mixed with seven ounces of water.
[00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:51.340]  Do that four times a day with about four or five squirts each class of the liver shield and the deep cleanse.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:41:05.925]  Then you take five to six pills of oxy powder when you go to bed, and on day six, you just lay on your right side, drink seven ounces of virgin olive oil, take two caplets, uh, not of bath salts, not of flavored stuff, not of, no, of pure medical grade.
[00:41:05.945 --> 00:41:10.887]  You get, you know, in any CVS or Walgreens, um, Epsom salts.
[00:41:12.268 --> 00:41:12.928]  Comes in a carton.
[00:41:14.141 --> 00:41:21.651]  You lay on your side for an hour, and then go to sleep, and the next morning, almost everybody has spectacular results when the gallbladder and the liver open up.

[00:41:55.223 --> 00:41:55.343]  Now
[00:41:57.784 --> 00:42:10.608]  I'm hyperventilating because it's a no-brainer that when you bring five million people from war-torn zones who are Wahhabist jihadists, who pledge the minute they get in they're going to kill everybody and start attacking everyone, they're so hateful.
[00:42:11.908 --> 00:42:17.910]  And the leftist governments say, oh submit to them, it's your fault, we're going to arrest you if you criticize them, don't wear short dresses.
[00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:20.591]  That this is cultural terrorism.
[00:42:22.304 --> 00:42:28.429]  And now you have these groups brought in even more, and they're announcing today that Europe and Obama want to bring in even more.
[00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:33.153]  So they're trying to break our will and do illogical things in our faces.
[00:42:34.634 --> 00:42:40.799]  I don't see it as going too well for them, but I'm sure now they're going to launch more and more devastating attacks.
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:42.981]  It's going to escalate.
[00:42:43.101 --> 00:42:47.345]  I think England's going to be hit, Europe's going to be hit a bunch, and I think you're going to see hits here in America.
[00:42:49.096 --> 00:43:02.364]  And notice it's the liberal leftist areas that coddle and grovel, like LA, and Brussels, Belgium, and Paris, France, and Cologne, Germany, where they literally hate themselves and worship anything anti-democratic.
[00:43:03.705 --> 00:43:11.829]  So it will be the liberals that worship this, because they hate the West so much, that are going to be the ones that will be attacked.
[00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:12.410]  You watch.
[00:43:13.339 --> 00:43:16.742]  These jihadists know not to attack veterans, patriots, or armed groups.
[00:43:17.323 --> 00:43:21.707]  They attack the people they disdain the most because they hate liberals.
[00:43:23.228 --> 00:43:30.194]  The problem is liberals hate their countries, and Christ, and the family, and men, and women, and children more.
[00:43:30.795 --> 00:43:31.636]  These are cuckold.
[00:43:33.573 --> 00:43:35.234]  People that are basically mentally ill.
[00:43:35.654 --> 00:43:38.436]  Paul Joseph Watson, we're gonna have you guys a little bit in the next hour.
[00:43:38.877 --> 00:43:40.378]  Joe Biggs is about to pop in as well.
[00:43:40.438 --> 00:43:41.839]  You've heard my breakdown of this.
[00:43:42.279 --> 00:43:43.100]  Unprecedented.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.003]  The media is now saying basically it's Donald Trump's fault.
[00:43:47.483 --> 00:43:50.365]  Soros is back out saying he's stirring up ISIS.
[00:43:50.806 --> 00:43:52.087]  Not the people that brought him in.
[00:43:52.527 --> 00:43:53.568]  This is unprecedented.
[00:43:55.492 --> 00:43:58.913]  Well, Salon.com came out with a headline about half an hour ago.
[00:43:58.933 --> 00:44:07.135]  It says, the Brussels attacks are a sobering reminder just how dangerous the GOP presidency would be with a huge picture of Donald Trump.
[00:44:07.596 --> 00:44:10.537]  You know, because Europe is really peaceful right now, isn't it?
[00:44:10.597 --> 00:44:12.697]  With a democratic president in office.
[00:44:13.177 --> 00:44:15.638]  So again, immediately we're seeing this narrative.
[00:44:15.958 --> 00:44:17.339]  You know, not all Muslims.
[00:44:17.399 --> 00:44:18.259]  In fact, Twitter
[00:44:18.959 --> 00:44:21.661]  The hashtag Stop Islam was trending.
[00:44:21.721 --> 00:44:24.443]  It's now been taken down in the USA trends.
[00:44:24.523 --> 00:44:27.965]  It's still trending in the UK, suggesting that they killed it.
[00:44:28.385 --> 00:44:31.087]  So there's a deliberate effort now to downplay this.
[00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:37.392]  Because this attack in Brussels, Belgium, we know from where it emerged, which was Molenbeek.
[00:44:37.432 --> 00:44:43.376]  Of course, four days ago we had the arrest of the Paris massacre culprit, Salah Abdeslam.
[00:44:44.398 --> 00:44:48.640]  And he was protected by people in Molenbeek.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.421]  This is why I say over and over again that it's not just jihadists.
[00:44:52.521 --> 00:44:54.102]  It's not just radical terrorists.
[00:44:54.422 --> 00:44:56.963]  There's a violence problem with Islam.
[00:44:57.443 --> 00:45:00.024]  Because many of these people support these sentiments.
[00:45:00.044 --> 00:45:00.324]  That's right.
[00:45:00.344 --> 00:45:02.205]  The communities are protecting them.
[00:45:02.505 --> 00:45:03.706]  You are run out of these.
[00:45:03.786 --> 00:45:11.769]  Jobig said in Iraq and Afghanistan, it was nothing like the general hate of every man, woman and child screaming, get out European.
[00:45:12.189 --> 00:45:12.629]  You were there.
[00:45:12.649 --> 00:45:13.650]  I mean, describe it, Paul.
[00:45:15.162 --> 00:45:15.842]  Yeah, we were there.
[00:45:15.882 --> 00:45:18.224]  We were refused service for being white.
[00:45:18.784 --> 00:45:24.648]  We were basically intimidated and chased out of the area the day after they raided the Paris mastermind.
[00:45:24.668 --> 00:45:26.269]  There were no police there whatsoever.
[00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.732]  But again, Muslim no-go areas are a conspiracy theory.
[00:45:29.792 --> 00:45:30.752]  The media told me so.
[00:45:31.393 --> 00:45:34.075]  So then we had this article out of Reuters on Sunday.
[00:45:45.342 --> 00:45:46.123]  He would have been gone.
[00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:47.144]  He would have been walking around.
[00:45:47.184 --> 00:45:48.084]  People would have seen him.
[00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:49.546]  People would have known he was there.
[00:45:49.906 --> 00:45:54.270]  Not a single person in that area reported it to police.
[00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:57.232]  Because again, there's a violence problem with Islam.
[00:45:57.492 --> 00:46:00.195]  It's not just a tiny fringe minority.
[00:46:00.535 --> 00:46:03.538]  There are Islamists who want to impose this on the world.
[00:46:03.898 --> 00:46:10.004]  They defend, they provide protection for actual terrorists, like the Paris Massacre culprit.
[00:46:10.464 --> 00:46:14.788]  And now they're saying that this attack in Brussels was probably advanced.
[00:46:14.868 --> 00:46:17.510]  It was brought forward because they had this guy.
[00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:18.912]  They could have interrogated him.
[00:46:18.952 --> 00:46:21.634]  He might have let slip some of the details.
[00:46:22.094 --> 00:46:25.898]  So again, there's this direct correlation back to Molenbeek.
[00:46:26.218 --> 00:46:28.859]  Which is just a short walk from the center of Brussels.
[00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:29.839]  We walked into it.
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.220]  We got kicked out.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.521]  Let me go over the false flag issue.
[00:46:33.921 --> 00:46:38.683]  Is this not a false flag by the socialists of Europe to destabilize things and bring in a civil emergency?
[00:46:39.023 --> 00:46:39.963]  I said it was day one.
[00:46:40.023 --> 00:46:40.804]  It's now happened.
[00:46:41.124 --> 00:46:42.744]  Hollande's up there like he's a hero.
[00:46:43.044 --> 00:46:44.305]  Merkel says she's a hero.
[00:46:44.605 --> 00:46:46.946]  They're the ones that brought these pieces of trash in.
[00:46:48.885 --> 00:46:51.827]  Well, no, because it's completely discredited their narrative.
[00:46:52.227 --> 00:46:54.308]  Multiculturalism doesn't work.
[00:46:54.389 --> 00:46:56.270]  That's been proven over and over again.
[00:46:56.710 --> 00:47:08.778]  Every time there's one of these attacks, it discredits that collectivist idea that you can import millions and millions of people, have no plan whatsoever to assimilate them, and not have problems.
[00:47:09.238 --> 00:47:11.420]  The narrative has been completely discredited.
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:19.687]  It's now to the point where, you know, you've got Green Party politicians up there saying Germans are going to be a minority in major cities within 20 years.
[00:47:19.727 --> 00:47:20.388]  That's a good thing.
[00:47:20.668 --> 00:47:30.516]  So the only thing I can think is that they're trying to just extract native populations out of these major cities altogether so they can have a dominant Muslim voting bloc.
[00:47:30.557 --> 00:47:33.279]  Who will now be the police and the bureaucrats and the bullies?
[00:47:33.699 --> 00:47:43.383]  I just can't believe Europeans let their police and military be ordered to let these people in, A, and then, B, have ISIS admitting they're doing it, and then let them kill people.
[00:47:43.783 --> 00:47:55.067]  Because, I mean, I saw the BBC footage, I've seen the Russia Today footage, where the reporters are being beaten up in Sweden and in Brussels, Belgium, and the police do nothing and stand there.
[00:47:56.482 --> 00:47:59.923]  No, there was a clip out of Sweden just yesterday.
[00:48:00.323 --> 00:48:04.524]  The police refused to go in with this film crew even after they'd been attacked.
[00:48:04.784 --> 00:48:10.545]  Within 90 seconds of arriving in this Muslim ghetto area, the cameraman got run over.
[00:48:10.966 --> 00:48:12.026]  They called the police.
[00:48:12.086 --> 00:48:16.327]  The police said, no, sorry, we can't go in there because it will cause more problems.
[00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:18.288]  But again, no-go areas.
[00:48:18.308 --> 00:48:20.529]  Those guys look so easy to bash their brains out.
[00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:22.470]  It looks like it'd be so easy to stomp their guts in.
[00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:23.710]  I'm about to throw up.
[00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:24.110]  Stay there.
[00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:27.032]  I'm going to skip this network break because this is an emergency transmission today.
[00:48:27.812 --> 00:48:28.913]  Joe Biggs, stay there, Paul.
[00:48:29.253 --> 00:48:30.893]  Joe Biggs, what is it like for you?
[00:48:30.913 --> 00:48:32.614]  Because again, you were in heavy combat.
[00:48:32.634 --> 00:48:33.895]  It was written about in magazines.
[00:48:34.135 --> 00:48:36.256]  You had big reporters embedded with your combat unit.
[00:48:36.716 --> 00:48:42.001]  I mean, and you told me on the phone, you're like, listen, this is more dangerous on average than being in country.
[00:48:42.021 --> 00:48:44.264]  A lot of those folks didn't like radical jihadists.
[00:48:44.624 --> 00:48:46.986]  They must have only brought radical jihadists in here.
[00:48:47.367 --> 00:48:48.848]  And that's what the media now admits.
[00:48:49.269 --> 00:48:52.752]  Europe is like picking only the very worst to bring into Europe.
[00:48:53.093 --> 00:48:54.814]  What do you think's going on here, Joe?
[00:48:55.495 --> 00:48:57.457]  Well, first off, I'd like to go into what happened today.
[00:48:57.557 --> 00:48:59.059]  I believe that today was a diversion.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:09.551]  After the capture of Abdullah Salam, the other sleeper cells in that Molenbeek area knew that they needed to do something to create a diversion so they can move those cells out of that area.
[00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.910]  Brutal.
[00:49:32.426 --> 00:49:34.529]  Shows you that there was some kind of break in that community.
[00:49:34.569 --> 00:49:39.095]  Somebody said something and those guys needed to create a diversion to get out of there.
[00:49:39.715 --> 00:49:41.337]  And I believe there will be more attacks.
[00:49:41.498 --> 00:49:44.001]  I believe London will be probably one of the next ones.
[00:49:44.361 --> 00:49:46.023]  But I don't think it's over in that area yet.
[00:49:46.043 --> 00:49:47.706]  I think there's going to be a lot more going on.
[00:49:49.042 --> 00:49:56.007]  Getting back, though, to you saying, look, the saturation of anti-westerners here is the highest I've ever seen on the phone.
[00:49:56.267 --> 00:49:57.068]  And I'm like, really, Joe?
[00:49:57.508 --> 00:50:01.851]  And you're like, yes, these people are trying to ram us with cars in our faces, throwing us out everywhere.
[00:50:01.871 --> 00:50:03.652]  It goes for miles and miles.
[00:50:04.413 --> 00:50:05.994]  And you were really shocked.
[00:50:06.394 --> 00:50:08.015]  You said it's worse than we even were told.
[00:50:08.035 --> 00:50:15.660]  And then they say Donald Trump's a conspiracy theorist for saying there's no go zones in London, no go zones in Brussels, no go zones in Paris.
[00:50:16.241 --> 00:50:17.942]  I was completely mind blown at the fact that
[00:50:18.462 --> 00:50:26.084]  People were writing these, you know, comments on these YouTube videos where, you know, we had done the radio show that night with you, and we're saying that we've been chased out of there.
[00:50:26.104 --> 00:50:27.624]  And they're like, oh, these things don't exist.
[00:50:27.904 --> 00:50:30.225]  There's no such thing as a no-go zone.
[00:50:30.505 --> 00:50:31.945]  You guys are making this whole story up.
[00:50:31.965 --> 00:50:33.466]  Well, what do you have to say about it now?
[00:50:33.746 --> 00:50:34.466]  It does exist.
[00:50:34.906 --> 00:50:43.348]  The fact that the three of us were out there with no weapons whatsoever, no escort, shows you the amount of danger that we were in and the people that live in that area.
[00:50:43.848 --> 00:50:46.549]  They shoot people all the time and the media hardly reports it.
[00:50:46.849 --> 00:50:50.770]  In Sweden, they order them not to report shootings and rapes if it's done by a jihadi.
[00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:56.692]  Any one of us could have been in another CIA room, a green screen room, getting our heads chopped off.
[00:50:57.212 --> 00:51:00.593]  You know, the fact that these people were screaming, chasing us in cars.
[00:51:01.213 --> 00:51:04.934]  We tried to seek refuge inside of what seemed to be like a restaurant or something.
[00:51:05.254 --> 00:51:09.896]  This guy jumps in front of Watson and grabs a door and was basically, you know, get the hell out of here.
[00:51:10.276 --> 00:51:13.217]  You know, that is a very volatile spot and these people
[00:51:14.077 --> 00:51:15.318]  It's not a religion of peace.
[00:51:15.399 --> 00:51:18.642]  And like Watson said, it's not a small number of these people.
[00:51:18.662 --> 00:51:20.884]  It's a very large amount of people.
[00:51:21.144 --> 00:51:25.068]  And there's nothing wrong with Donald Trump going, hey, let's shut this down for a second.
[00:51:25.108 --> 00:51:28.792]  Let's figure out a better way to vet this so we don't have more of these attacks.
[00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:30.693]  Incredible.
[00:51:32.486 --> 00:51:40.033]  Well, we got Tim Kennedy coming in today, and that should be very, very informative because obviously he's taken out a lot of the top terrorist targets.
[00:51:40.073 --> 00:51:43.536]  That's classified, but the point is I separately have gone and researched it.
[00:51:44.076 --> 00:51:49.981]  But it's just so clear that the elite have brought these people in.
[00:51:50.021 --> 00:51:50.462]  They have.
[00:51:50.522 --> 00:51:50.982]  They've done it.
[00:51:51.342 --> 00:51:52.463]  They're letting them attack us.
[00:51:52.503 --> 00:51:53.484]  They're bringing in even more.
[00:51:53.504 --> 00:51:56.147]  And then they're going to take our freedoms when they attack.
[00:51:57.148 --> 00:51:58.188]  This is a false flag.
[00:51:58.208 --> 00:52:02.950]  I mean, is there any doubt in your mind that the establishment knows full well what they're doing, Joe?
[00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:05.091]  And where do you think they're going with this and then Paul Watson?
[00:52:05.832 --> 00:52:06.812]  Of course they know what they're doing.
[00:52:06.852 --> 00:52:09.353]  I mean, we already saw it happen in the Paris attacks.
[00:52:09.873 --> 00:52:14.175]  You know, this is stuff that's going to continue to happen if we don't do something.
[00:52:14.315 --> 00:52:26.440]  And the fact that we don't have one presidential candidate other than Trump that really has a plan to stop something like this and take a step back and look at it to reassess the situation and actually do something positive for the American people.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:35.184]  You know, we already have people like Merkel and all these other folks like Hollande that are completely ignoring the fact that these people are coming into their countries and killing them.
[00:52:35.204 --> 00:52:38.266]  Instead, they'd rather kiss their butts and go, okay, let's bring them in.
[00:52:38.286 --> 00:52:39.026]  Let's bring in more.
[00:52:39.046 --> 00:52:39.847]  Let's bring in more.
[00:52:39.907 --> 00:52:47.591]  And then notice again, it's that overturning of reality where Soros, Megyn Kelly, all these people come out and say Trump is stirring up ISIS.
[00:52:47.891 --> 00:52:49.572]  It's Trump's fault when they attack.
[00:52:49.892 --> 00:52:51.593]  And then when the sleeper cells activate,
[00:52:52.153 --> 00:52:56.035]  They're gonna go on the news like the Washington Post and say, arrest Trump!
[00:52:56.615 --> 00:53:07.541]  I mean, folks, think of it, and the police officers go off-duty, black police officers, you name it, and say the Trump people do nothing, and the anti-Trump people run around hitting, spitting, and attacking, and the media says it's their fault.
[00:53:07.862 --> 00:53:14.065]  Folks, this is Soros and the globalists, allied with the jihadists, communists, and every other form of filth, attacking us.
[00:53:14.325 --> 00:53:18.888]  Here's Donald Trump in January, warning of exactly what was really happening.
[00:53:18.928 --> 00:53:19.228]  Here it is.
[00:53:19.841 --> 00:53:27.869]  We do admit 100,000 Muslims on a permanent basis here every year, and this is going to be the lar- or is already the largest religion in the world.
[00:53:27.889 --> 00:53:29.831]  Can you really say let's do a temporary halt?
[00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:32.591]  There's something going on, Maria.
[00:53:32.871 --> 00:53:33.671]  Go to Brussels.
[00:53:34.032 --> 00:53:34.812]  Go to Paris.
[00:53:35.172 --> 00:53:36.473]  Go to different places.
[00:53:36.913 --> 00:53:38.194]  There's something going on.
[00:53:38.354 --> 00:53:39.314]  And it's not good.
[00:53:39.654 --> 00:53:41.015]  Where they want Sharia law.
[00:53:41.075 --> 00:53:41.955]  Where they want this.
[00:53:41.995 --> 00:53:45.357]  Where they want things that... You know, there has to be some assimilation.
[00:53:45.537 --> 00:53:46.658]  There is no assimilation.
[00:53:47.018 --> 00:53:48.559]  There's something bad going on.
[00:53:48.679 --> 00:53:52.681]  And until we find out what it is, so we can correct it... You go to Brussels.
[00:53:52.801 --> 00:53:54.682]  I was in Brussels a long time ago.
[00:53:54.702 --> 00:53:55.122]  20 years ago.
[00:53:55.462 --> 00:53:56.423]  So beautiful.
[00:53:56.483 --> 00:53:57.263]  Everything's so beautiful.
[00:53:58.052 --> 00:54:00.094]  It's like living in a hellhole right now.
[00:54:00.515 --> 00:54:03.097]  You go to these different places, there's something going on.
[00:54:12.051 --> 00:54:14.553]  And then Cruz goes, that's dumb, they're fighting ISIS.
[00:54:14.613 --> 00:54:16.574]  No, they helped put ISIS in, and Al-Qaeda.
[00:54:17.094 --> 00:54:18.415]  So Trump knows everything, folks.
[00:54:18.455 --> 00:54:19.476]  He's ready to destroy them.
[00:54:19.776 --> 00:54:24.339]  He's ready to bring out how criminals in our government, the Clintons and the Bushes, worked with the Saudis on 9-11.
[00:54:24.959 --> 00:54:26.060]  The military's awake.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:32.484]  The military, as you know, Joe, four years ago said no to launching attacks to back ISIS and Al-Qaeda, to their credit.
[00:54:32.744 --> 00:54:34.365]  That's got to really scare the globalists, Joe.
[00:54:34.665 --> 00:54:35.246]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:35.266 --> 00:54:42.814]  I mean, I spoke with a British couple over South by Southwest here at the event in Austin, and the wife was actually telling me how her and her husband went to the UAE.
[00:54:43.434 --> 00:54:46.277]  And when she went there, she thought about the culture.
[00:54:46.297 --> 00:54:46.958]  She goes, you know what?
[00:54:46.998 --> 00:54:47.699]  I'm not going to wear a skirt.
[00:54:47.719 --> 00:54:48.560]  I'm going to wear jeans.
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.462]  I'm going to be respectful of how they are.
[00:54:50.962 --> 00:54:56.487]  So she was walking around to the UAE, had no, you know, cleavage type, anything showing, no legs, nothing like that.
[00:54:56.747 --> 00:54:58.169]  It was very respectful of the culture.
[00:54:58.189 --> 00:55:11.281]  And she says now when she goes back home to London where she lives in certain areas, when she dresses the way that's part of their culture, she gets looked at, called a whore, spit at, and completely demonized because these people, like you said, are not assimilating.
[00:55:11.761 --> 00:55:14.964]  What's amazing is they mix with this weird leftist hatred.
[00:55:15.425 --> 00:55:22.371]  They're so entitled, from what I've been told, they're worse than in their own countries, now here in the West, with the left backing them and loving it.
[00:55:22.812 --> 00:55:25.334]  What sick, bizarre filth.
[00:55:25.695 --> 00:55:26.816]  Paul, these aren't leftists.
[00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:28.958]  What do you call these bizarro folks?
[00:55:29.906 --> 00:55:32.609]  Well, they act like fascists, so why not call them fascists?
[00:55:32.649 --> 00:55:43.961]  I mean, ISIS in its own manifesto said, you know, radical Islamists share a lot of the same beliefs as the modern progressive left, so we should start recruiting them, radicalizing them, and arming them.
[00:55:44.261 --> 00:55:47.925]  They said that in their own documents, so that's a major correlation.
[00:55:48.305 --> 00:55:49.106]  The other point is,
[00:55:49.907 --> 00:55:55.074]  You've got a lot of people on the left again saying, blaming foreign policy for terrorist acts like this.
[00:55:55.154 --> 00:56:00.882]  Well, you can argue that arming jihadists in Libya and Syria by NATO was a disastrous policy, it was.
[00:56:01.242 --> 00:56:07.110]  But then you look at Belgium specifically, okay, they were against the Iraq War from the very start.
[00:56:07.631 --> 00:56:15.759]  They suspended their bombing campaign against ISIS in Syria eight months ago, and they still got attacked by terrorists.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:22.667]  So you can't use that excuse over and over again, blaming it on foreign policy, to absolve Islam of blame.
[00:56:22.767 --> 00:56:23.567]  Again, let's expand.
[00:56:23.608 --> 00:56:28.332]  France-backed al-Qaeda and ISIS, the number one group, it's on record, to take over Syria.
[00:56:29.073 --> 00:56:33.435]  And so ISIS is attacking France to give Hollande cover to take French freedom.
[00:56:33.955 --> 00:56:36.236]  Look, Hollande is working for ISIS.
[00:56:36.276 --> 00:56:37.376]  I'm not just saying that, folks.
[00:56:37.616 --> 00:56:39.937]  It's 100% proof we have them.
[00:56:39.977 --> 00:56:40.998]  They let them bring them in.
[00:56:41.778 --> 00:56:43.138]  They have suspended the liberties.
[00:56:43.219 --> 00:56:49.421]  Paul, is there any doubt that Hollande and Merkel are actually... I guarantee you, they're meeting with ISIS leadership.
[00:56:51.169 --> 00:56:59.037]  Well, they would rather their own citizens be killed than admit that multiculturalism is a completely failed and disastrous policy.
[00:56:59.077 --> 00:57:00.198]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:57:01.159 --> 00:57:02.100]  Yes, but they've been.
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:05.263]  They've been quarterbacking funding ISIS and Al Qaeda in Syria.
[00:57:05.603 --> 00:57:07.105]  They worked with Turkey to bring them in.
[00:57:07.165 --> 00:57:08.246]  It's worse than that, Paul.
[00:57:10.049 --> 00:57:11.990]  No, no, it's a complete disaster on all sides.
[00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:13.211]  No, they hate Europe!
[00:57:13.251 --> 00:57:14.272]  They want to destroy it!
[00:57:14.372 --> 00:57:14.832]  Exactly!
[00:57:14.853 --> 00:57:24.980]  I mean, even the lead singer Jesse Hughes from Eagles of Death Metal, the band that was playing at the Boticlan Theatre when that horrendous attack happened, said that he thought that this was an inside job.
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:26.361]  The fact that he said that...
[00:57:26.701 --> 00:57:32.283]  There was supposed to be a large amount of security that never even showed up, and only one did, and he was in the backstage area.
[00:57:32.543 --> 00:57:36.064]  And he said he kept getting a bad feeling, and he kept asking these guys, who is this guy?
[00:57:36.424 --> 00:57:37.344]  It doesn't feel right.
[00:57:37.404 --> 00:57:38.484]  I don't want to go on with this.
[00:57:38.905 --> 00:57:40.425]  And then that entire thing unfolded.
[00:57:40.665 --> 00:57:42.005]  So there's definitely something going on.
[00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:44.466]  And by the way, I want the lead singer of Eagles of Death on immediately.
[00:57:44.486 --> 00:57:45.687]  Yeah, I've already contacted him.
[00:57:45.727 --> 00:57:46.307]  He's out of town.
[00:57:46.347 --> 00:57:49.748]  I spoke with one of his managers out in LA the other day.
[00:57:49.988 --> 00:57:50.528]  Well, good job.
[00:57:50.928 --> 00:57:51.848]  I know I'm ranting here.
[00:57:51.868 --> 00:57:52.688]  Paul Watson, come back.
[00:57:52.708 --> 00:57:53.609]  You were trying to say something.
[00:57:53.629 --> 00:57:54.569]  I'm just so angry.
[00:57:55.069 --> 00:58:07.311]  I'm so angry at these pigs, like Hollande and Merkel and Obama, all anti-West, anti-freedom trash, bringing in the most abusive, anti-liberty scum, anti-female scum.
[00:58:07.631 --> 00:58:12.272]  I have daughters, and I'm sick of the left saying they have the moral high ground over women!
[00:58:12.452 --> 00:58:15.193]  You people hate women, you goddamn pieces of crap!
[00:58:15.553 --> 00:58:16.073]  Excuse me.
[00:58:16.373 --> 00:58:16.853]  I'm going to stop.
[00:58:16.873 --> 00:58:17.473]  It's a family show.
[00:58:17.493 --> 00:58:18.034]  I apologize.
[00:58:18.234 --> 00:58:19.674]  But I have had enough of these people!
[00:58:21.949 --> 00:58:22.770]  Go ahead, Watson!
[00:58:24.131 --> 00:58:30.635]  Well, I've just superimposed a picture of the Belgian flag over my Facebook profile picture, so that means everything's gonna be fine.
[00:58:30.655 --> 00:58:33.237]  We don't have to talk about how Islam's not religion of peace.
[00:58:34.551 --> 00:58:35.352]  Look, I apologize.
[00:58:35.372 --> 00:58:35.912]  Let's just come back.
[00:58:35.932 --> 00:58:37.254]  I did not mean to do that on purpose, folks.
[00:58:37.334 --> 00:58:42.039]  I am just getting... I just started thinking about Obama and Merkel and Hollande, these big sacks of filth.
[00:58:42.399 --> 00:58:43.120]  They hate us!
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:44.401]  They're coming for us!
[00:58:44.562 --> 00:58:45.282]  They're enemies!
[00:58:45.463 --> 00:58:49.066]  It's all planned with that fricking Saudi Arabia!
[00:58:49.167 --> 00:58:52.150]  I'll tell you what, I've had enough of you people.
[00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:53.431]  We're coming for the globalists!
[00:58:54.152 --> 00:58:54.672]  Soros!

[00:59:53.282 --> 00:59:54.583]  Check it out for yourself today.
[00:59:58.763 --> 01:00:03.405]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:08.987 --> 01:00:15.009]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:18.651]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:20.251 --> 01:00:26.514]  China is the billion and a half political slaves that are leveraging out all other economies and industries in the world.
[01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:28.971]  But the globalists are allied with them.
[01:00:28.991 --> 01:00:35.537]  The globalists are also allied with the mind control cult that is radical Wahhabist Islam that's taking over Islam.
[01:00:36.097 --> 01:00:42.222]  And they're the muscle to physically stir up trouble worldwide to take Western liberties as the answer to countering that.
[01:00:42.523 --> 01:00:48.127]  And our elites think we're so unlogical and so stupid, they're going to bring millions of them in, protect them and let them attack.
[01:00:49.008 --> 01:00:54.415]  I want to tell Soros, Obama, Hillary, the globalists, all of you, we know you're behind it.
[01:00:54.636 --> 01:01:00.644]  We know you turn these people loose on Syria, on Egypt, and our allies that are pro-Western and are good Muslims.
[01:01:02.441 --> 01:01:06.285]  You are the filth of the earth and we see you and we know who you are.
[01:01:07.186 --> 01:01:13.333]  Joe Biggs, we have to get this message out because if the elite don't know, the people don't know the full story, they're going to keep doing this.
[01:01:13.353 --> 01:01:14.354]  This is so naked.
[01:01:14.615 --> 01:01:15.636]  It's so obvious, Joe.
[01:01:15.656 --> 01:01:22.203]  I mean, I'm kind of fearful for the fact that we have this, you know, looming racial war, you know, about to happen.
[01:01:22.323 --> 01:01:23.044]  And then you have
[01:01:24.005 --> 01:01:32.375]  Possibly sleeper cells moving in the background unseen right now because so many people are focused on these Trump rallies.
[01:01:33.576 --> 01:01:42.627]  My fear is that they're going to take one of these rallies and then something's going to happen at one of them and they're still going to blame him and blame the deaths on him and then that's what they're going to use to try to take him out.
[01:01:42.967 --> 01:01:44.148]  It's definitely a possibility.
[01:01:44.168 --> 01:01:47.591]  And the trendies are so stupid, they'll actually blame Trump of jihadist attack even though he tried to stop it.
[01:01:47.611 --> 01:01:48.011]  Of course, of course.
[01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:49.512]  I mean, they'll probably sit there and shake their hand.
[01:01:49.552 --> 01:01:54.756]  If any of the jihadis survive their bombing, they'll come over and shake their hand and tell them thank you.
[01:01:55.256 --> 01:01:55.877]  And they want more.
[01:01:56.117 --> 01:01:59.920]  In fact, Paul, we've seen the Twitter comments from the left saying, I hope jihadis kill Trump.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.222]  These little babies wouldn't last 10 minutes in Saudi Arabia.
[01:02:03.522 --> 01:02:06.304]  Try dressing up like a woman over there and see what happens, you idiots.
[01:02:06.605 --> 01:02:06.825]  Paul?
[01:02:09.268 --> 01:02:12.652]  ...Trump tweets are just hundreds and hundreds a day.
[01:02:12.692 --> 01:02:14.673]  I mean, I've stopped looking anymore, it's ridiculous.
[01:02:15.034 --> 01:02:18.097]  But here was a tweet from somebody in the immediate aftermath of this attack.
[01:02:25.003 --> 01:02:28.847]  Okay, this is a guy who was against the Iraq war from the start.
[01:02:28.987 --> 01:02:33.891]  Hillary Clinton voted for that war, which killed nearly a million Muslims.
[01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:38.416]  Hillary Clinton was behind the Libya and Syria debacle.
[01:02:38.516 --> 01:02:41.398]  Allied with Al-Qaeda, allied with Al-Qaeda, allied with Al-Qaeda.
[01:02:41.719 --> 01:02:44.822]  She was allied with Al-Qaeda there, then Syria, go ahead.
[01:02:46.172 --> 01:02:51.115]  Yeah, but it's all Donald Trump's fault because he was against a war that killed nearly a million Muslims.
[01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:52.716]  That doesn't make much sense, does it?
[01:02:53.356 --> 01:02:54.537]  Then you've got another one here.
[01:02:54.557 --> 01:02:59.779]  If you've already blamed what's happened in Brussels on Islamic immigrants, then you're a racist.
[01:02:59.919 --> 01:03:01.160]  You are a racist!
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.002]  Well, Islam is not a race to begin with.
[01:03:04.742 --> 01:03:07.806]  Okay, so you've got that sentiment over and over again.
[01:03:08.046 --> 01:03:17.418]  You've got leftists saying, don't politicize this tragedy, while they politicize it to blame the people who they're ideologically aligned against.
[01:03:17.478 --> 01:03:20.843]  So you've got the typical stock response from the left.
[01:03:21.283 --> 01:03:22.905]  And again, it's the ostrich brigade.
[01:03:22.945 --> 01:03:29.294]  They will stick their head in the sand and bleat all day, Islam is a religion of peace, Islam is a religion of peace.
[01:03:29.734 --> 01:03:35.843]  They don't face the reality and only by facing the reality are we going to reduce this kind of terrorism.
[01:03:36.701 --> 01:03:37.142]  I agree.
[01:03:37.282 --> 01:03:41.546]  I want to get you guys, I know you're busy writing articles and getting ready, but Tucker Carlson's coming on.
[01:03:41.586 --> 01:03:50.435]  I want to get you both to pop in like 40 after or so just for 10 minutes with him and make some points because this is really powerful radio and TV.
[01:03:50.875 --> 01:03:51.756]  I personally
[01:03:52.856 --> 01:03:56.119]  I'm seriously angry because I can see the plan now.
[01:03:56.239 --> 01:03:57.199]  It's so dastardly.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.680]  It's meant to kill our freedoms.
[01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:00.021]  It makes me sick.
[01:04:00.061 --> 01:04:02.383]  And Paul, just a quick comment, and then Joe.
[01:04:02.683 --> 01:04:08.988]  Do you not concur with me or do you disagree or do you feel in your gut, as I've been saying, it's a buildup, that this is the beginning of something really bad?
[01:04:09.228 --> 01:04:10.890]  I know they have sleeper cells everywhere.
[01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.730]  It's admitted.
[01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:13.752]  And they're getting ready to go absolutely ape.
[01:04:14.132 --> 01:04:15.753]  And then somehow we're going to be blamed for it.
[01:04:15.793 --> 01:04:16.574]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:24.465]  Well, if you look at what the top security experts in Belgium are saying today, they're completely overwhelmed.
[01:04:24.505 --> 01:04:32.691]  They've got every single police detective, every single intelligence expert in Belgium chasing these jihadis around everywhere.
[01:04:32.971 --> 01:04:33.872]  They can't cope.
[01:04:33.932 --> 01:04:35.293]  They're completely overwhelmed.
[01:04:35.353 --> 01:04:45.120]  So if they have enough, you know, if they have enough organization to do this really on a larger scale, then yes, it's going to happen because there's simply not enough resources to track it all.
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:53.506]  And as I said, in places like Molenbeek, they've got so much support, just from all the other Islamists, that that only embodies... Well, that's the issue.
[01:04:53.546 --> 01:05:01.652]  They brought in alien outside radical jihad transplants, and these people are being celebrated as heroes, and the attacks will just get worse and worse.
[01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:03.213]  Thank you, Paul Powerful.
[01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:04.294]  Thank you, Biggs.
[01:05:04.354 --> 01:05:05.955]  We'll be back with Tucker Carlson.
[01:05:06.255 --> 01:05:14.399]  Marines across the Corps will be challenged on their unconscious prejudice as women get the opportunity to become grunts for the first time.
[01:05:14.679 --> 01:05:16.580]  ReportsMilitary.com.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:29.586]  The Military Corps is rolling out mandatory training for all Marines before the first future female rifleman hits boot camp, aiming to set conditions for a smooth transition and head off cultural resistance.
[01:05:30.046 --> 01:05:39.632]  Mobile training teams will be dispatched to installations across the Corps throughout May and June to offer a two-day seminar to Majors and Lieutenant Colonels.
[01:05:39.932 --> 01:05:49.879]  Topics include unconscious bias, which focuses on how people prejudge others based on factors such as race and gender, and principles of institutional change.
[01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:59.325]  A survey obtained by the Washington Post found that the majority of male Marines at every rank opposed the decision to have women serve in combat jobs.
[01:05:59.745 --> 01:06:03.647]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:06:04.147 --> 01:06:06.829]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:06:06.929 --> 01:06:07.369]  Good, brother.

[01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:11.031]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:06:11.171 --> 01:06:15.153]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:06:15.193 --> 01:06:20.056]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.

[01:06:33.186 --> 01:06:36.109]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:06:36.229 --> 01:06:37.591]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:06:37.871 --> 01:06:43.217]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[01:06:43.237 --> 01:06:45.539]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:57.692]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:22.458]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.875 --> 01:08:30.957]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Tucker Carlson, the man that heads up TheDailyCaller.com, one of the top news sites in the world.
[01:08:30.997 --> 01:08:33.218]  Not just alternative news, but leading the news.
[01:08:33.858 --> 01:08:37.499]  Of course, featured quite a bit on DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com, you name it.
[01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:39.399]  And I wanted to get him on about election 2016.
[01:08:39.619 --> 01:08:44.241]  He's had great coverage on Fox weekdays and on the weekends with the show he hosts.
[01:08:45.341 --> 01:08:46.942]  But now we have these big attacks.
[01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:48.122]  And look, I want to be clear.
[01:08:49.952 --> 01:08:53.515]  What I've said over the years has been misrepresented by the mainstream media.
[01:08:53.535 --> 01:08:58.259]  And so I don't blame people like Carlson when he would just hear gestalts of it saying, you know, that guy's a kook.
[01:08:58.819 --> 01:09:07.746]  Because the media would say that I said, this is what Hardball host said, Chris Matthews, that Bush had a plunger like Wile E. Coyote and blew up the World Trade Center towers.
[01:09:08.407 --> 01:09:12.230]  What I said is, from what I saw in the news at the time and our sources in Congress,
[01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:31.461]  Was that radicals in Saudi Arabia and their government, some of their royal family, were funding the hijackers, the FBI was ordered to stand down, that was in the news, and that in the congressional report that came out a few years after 9-11, that there was basically a stand-down ordered at NORAD, and that they flew the bin Ladens out of the country.
[01:09:32.061 --> 01:09:33.362]  And that was in the Miami Herald.
[01:09:33.442 --> 01:09:41.647]  So, I said inside job, false flag, because criminal elements in both parties stood to gain
[01:09:42.972 --> 01:09:44.712]  And they allow those attacks to take place.
[01:09:45.533 --> 01:09:46.993]  I believe there's radical Islam.
[01:09:47.093 --> 01:09:48.073]  I'm totally against it.
[01:09:49.473 --> 01:09:50.574]  I'm a classical liberal.
[01:09:51.674 --> 01:09:54.454]  I can't stand the way Saudi Arabia beheads gay people.
[01:09:54.594 --> 01:10:01.416]  I can't stand the way the jihadists throw, you know, Catholic priests off of cliffs and homosexuals.
[01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:03.676]  And then I see the left allied with them.
[01:10:04.756 --> 01:10:07.697]  So when I say what happened in Brussels, Belgium,
[01:10:08.695 --> 01:10:16.358]  That's killed 34 people and hundreds injured, more they think are going to die in huge bombings that happened earlier this morning.
[01:10:17.298 --> 01:10:31.123]  I'm saying it's a false flag in that Hollande and Merkel and all the rest of them brought millions of people in from war-torn zones that they knew were connected to Saudi Arabia and Qatar and jihadis and who said they were going to attack.
[01:10:31.483 --> 01:10:34.164]  And they've got Stinger missiles that came out from Benghazi.
[01:10:35.169 --> 01:10:47.821]  Why would our governments bring these people in to declare civil emergencies, take people's rights in France and Germany, arrest nationalist leaders like Marie Le Pen that's not even as hardcore as Donald Trump?
[01:10:48.902 --> 01:10:50.384]  The left wants to arrest Trump.
[01:10:50.404 --> 01:10:56.249]  The Washington Post last week said could he be fined or indicted or sued because he's causing the violence.
[01:10:56.309 --> 01:10:56.750]  No, he's not.
[01:10:58.103 --> 01:11:03.606]  So that's where I'm coming from here is, are they that dumb to bring jihadis in and know they're not going to attack?
[01:11:03.806 --> 01:11:06.287]  Or are they using it to take liberties?
[01:11:06.408 --> 01:11:09.649]  Regardless, they are aiding and abetting it.
[01:11:10.009 --> 01:11:11.030]  They are involved in it.
[01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:12.411]  So it's a false flank.
[01:11:12.491 --> 01:11:13.852]  It's a real jihadi attack.
[01:11:14.712 --> 01:11:20.515]  But if I'm involved and let you in, knowing what you're going to do, then I am partially to blame.
[01:11:20.575 --> 01:11:23.237]  And so that's where I really stand when I say false flank.
[01:11:24.096 --> 01:11:30.459]  Because NATO and our own government has been helping fund al-Qaeda groups in Syria, and now they're coming through Turkey.
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:31.660]  This isn't blowback.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.261]  They knew this would happen.
[01:11:33.361 --> 01:11:35.722]  That's why the Pentagon, four years ago, went on TV.
[01:11:36.923 --> 01:11:38.924]  All these top... I had Colonel Schaeffer on, you name it.
[01:11:39.124 --> 01:11:40.225]  That's why General Dempsey...
[01:11:41.044 --> 01:11:48.268]  Then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs went to Obama the night before the air raid started on Assad and said, we're not going to be the air force of Al-Qaeda.
[01:11:48.788 --> 01:11:49.869]  So they changed the name to ISIS.
[01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:54.311]  No one's defending Assad, but he is a good guy compared to ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[01:11:55.091 --> 01:11:57.753]  The Russians have come in, kicked Al-Qaeda and ISIS butt.
[01:11:58.453 --> 01:12:02.455]  Now all these refugees that came in to invade, almost all of them, are going into Europe.
[01:12:03.096 --> 01:12:04.797]  Why is the left inviting them in?
[01:12:05.077 --> 01:12:06.778]  Why is the left saying we want you here?
[01:12:07.198 --> 01:12:10.380]  Why are they telling German women don't wear short skirts, don't go out at night?
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:15.823]  Why are they beating up BBC crews and 60-minute crews all over Europe at bus stations?
[01:12:17.123 --> 01:12:21.626]  They've now mutated hardcore leftist garbage with hardcore radical Islam.
[01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:23.792]  And it's bizarre.
[01:12:23.912 --> 01:12:24.493]  It's crazy.
[01:12:24.533 --> 01:12:26.496]  And it really makes me ask, what is the left doing?
[01:12:26.516 --> 01:12:28.139]  Because I've never been what you call a right-winger.
[01:12:28.179 --> 01:12:28.760]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.123]  But I gotta tell you, the left...
[01:12:32.268 --> 01:12:35.810]  Is the most sickening political amalgamation I've ever seen.
[01:12:35.850 --> 01:12:36.651]  They have rotted.
[01:12:36.871 --> 01:12:37.591]  Now I'm ranting.
[01:12:37.631 --> 01:12:40.193]  Tucker Carlson is joining us for the next 47 minutes.
[01:12:40.233 --> 01:12:43.295]  I really appreciate Tucker coming on DailyCaller.com.
[01:12:43.635 --> 01:12:44.856]  Tucker, that's my rant.
[01:12:45.216 --> 01:12:48.518]  Now you know face-to-face where I stand when I say false flag.
[01:12:48.839 --> 01:12:49.639]  Do you agree with that?
[01:12:49.759 --> 01:12:50.440]  Disagree with that?
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:51.700]  And where do you see this going?
[01:12:52.021 --> 01:12:58.585]  How is the left, from Obama to Merkel to Hollande, going to deal with these sleeper cells clearly ramping up
[01:12:59.105 --> 01:13:00.426]  How are they going to blame Donald Trump?
[01:13:00.446 --> 01:13:01.306]  Because they're in the news.
[01:13:01.546 --> 01:13:04.688]  Trump already blaming Muslims' immigration for terror attacks.
[01:13:05.028 --> 01:13:09.930]  I've seen dozens of articles today in mainstream news blaming him somehow.
[01:13:10.471 --> 01:13:12.752]  Will the public really buy this, Tucker Carlson?
[01:13:13.612 --> 01:13:18.915]  Well, you know, I guess I don't fully understand what the term false flag means, so I can't endorse
[01:13:19.894 --> 01:13:30.318]  That idea I do think that you're right that the left has made this possible I don't think they've invited terror attacks on purpose I think the I think the explanation is more prosaic more obvious.
[01:13:30.418 --> 01:13:43.023]  This is a result of the guilt of the successful This is when you know Western nations have begun to feel that they're not justified in being as successful as they are in the case of Germany Angela Merkel in effect runs Europe
[01:13:43.689 --> 01:13:53.333]  And she has the special burden of German war guilt, which makes it impossible for her, and many Germans, frankly, in elite positions, to look at the rest of the world clearly.
[01:13:53.373 --> 01:14:02.576]  They always feel that they're in a morally inferior position, and so it's impossible for them to say, this is an inferior culture, these people believe things that are a threat.
[01:14:03.126 --> 01:14:05.348]  To liberal western values.
[01:14:05.388 --> 01:14:06.329]  They're a threat to us.
[01:14:06.689 --> 01:14:08.430]  They can't make normal comments.
[01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:11.273]  You're saying it's total self-loathing, self-hating.
[01:14:11.793 --> 01:14:12.834]  Of course it is.
[01:14:13.294 --> 01:14:14.435]  Because you know these people.
[01:14:14.475 --> 01:14:15.696]  And I live next to them.
[01:14:16.037 --> 01:14:19.680]  By the way, I don't think any of them welcome terror attacks.
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:22.282]  I don't think any of them are evil on purpose.
[01:14:22.322 --> 01:14:25.284]  I don't even think the president is evil on purpose.
[01:14:25.584 --> 01:14:30.989]  But I really think they're starting from a place where they are incapable or unwilling
[01:14:31.448 --> 01:14:31.828]  We're good.
[01:14:50.572 --> 01:14:54.317]  Be biased against one another on the basis of race or national origin or religion.
[01:14:54.477 --> 01:14:59.503]  Basically, using a denunciation of terror attacks to scold America for its intolerance.
[01:15:00.103 --> 01:15:08.173]  This is the reason that this whole order, world order, post-war, Second World War order that we have now is going to crumble.
[01:15:08.513 --> 01:15:10.816]  Because it's not adequate, it's not strong enough.
[01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:17.031]  So it comes down to the fact that they hate the West, they have self-loathing, and they want to be the managers over this whole multicultural nightmare.
[01:15:31.346 --> 01:15:47.109]  I see that for a lot of them, and I think you're right, Tucker, for maybe 60%, but there's a sicker part to the social engineering that they know if they bring in incompatible groups, there's going to be a lot of friction, and then the state can come in with political correctness and more speech control and make us comply with radical Islam.
[01:15:47.589 --> 01:15:53.610]  Look at Europe banning right-wing and nationalist groups protesting and, you know, taking their rights away.
[01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:56.771]  Well, of course, I mean, because that's always the response.
[01:15:56.931 --> 01:15:59.331]  Someone horrible, whether it's domestic or international,
[01:15:59.833 --> 01:16:07.056]  Does something unacceptable and you need to give up your rights as a response to that, rather than, you know, punishing the person responsible.
[01:16:07.156 --> 01:16:09.817]  You, middle America, need to stop doing this, that, the other thing.
[01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:10.417]  It's your fault.
[01:16:10.497 --> 01:16:10.797]  Of course.
[01:16:11.137 --> 01:16:11.818]  I agree with that.
[01:16:11.838 --> 01:16:14.999]  And also in this country, there's a direct political
[01:16:15.515 --> 01:16:18.996]  Implication which is more immigration means more Democratic voters.
[01:16:19.056 --> 01:16:23.538]  So that's that's always kind of present in the calculation for Democratic politicians.
[01:16:23.578 --> 01:16:26.519]  You can't prevent anyone from moving here because they're going to vote for you.
[01:16:26.639 --> 01:16:26.959]  Sure.
[01:16:26.979 --> 01:16:28.520]  What about the left's love affair?
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:32.802]  Because the left doesn't at the universities loves radical Islamics.
[01:16:33.542 --> 01:16:34.764]  More than anybody I've ever seen.
[01:16:35.304 --> 01:16:40.870]  Even though radical Islamists would kill gays, lesbians, liberals in a minute in their home country.
[01:16:41.251 --> 01:16:46.497]  And the main groups they seem to want to bring in are radical jihadis that are invading more moderate Muslim countries.
[01:16:47.708 --> 01:16:51.191]  The hilarious part is that you hear Trump denounced every day.
[01:16:51.231 --> 01:16:52.312]  I'm not flacking for Trump.
[01:16:52.332 --> 01:16:55.115]  I just marvel at this as a sexist, okay?
[01:16:55.155 --> 01:16:57.497]  Because he's, I don't know, he's intolerant.
[01:16:57.577 --> 01:17:08.067]  Well really, if you think about it, Trump is criticizing cultures that literally don't allow women to drive or to appear in public or to have physical contact with men, not their wives.
[01:17:08.147 --> 01:17:10.269]  Or pour acid on their faces if they talk back.
[01:17:11.437 --> 01:17:13.918]  I'm sorry to laugh, but it's just so insane.
[01:17:13.958 --> 01:17:27.602]  If you're a sincere feminist and you're worried about preserving the rights of women, and by the way, as the father of three daughters, I'm sympathetic to that, then aren't you most angry at the culture, and it's like a third of the world, that doesn't allow women basic human and civil rights?
[01:17:27.622 --> 01:17:27.923]  No, you're not.
[01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:28.903]  And I have daughters.
[01:17:29.063 --> 01:17:29.743]  I have daughters.
[01:17:30.003 --> 01:17:33.184]  I am at a fundamental level disgusted by that.
[01:17:33.204 --> 01:17:39.647]  And then the left tells me that I don't care about women as if they have some moral superiority they just make up.
[01:17:41.167 --> 01:17:42.688]  Does that annoy you as a father as well?
[01:17:43.129 --> 01:17:49.835]  Well, what really surprises me is the frequency with which you hear the term sexist and the rarity with which you hear it defined.
[01:17:50.015 --> 01:17:52.618]  So like, you're a sexist, which in other words means just shut up.
[01:17:52.658 --> 01:17:54.259]  You're not allowed in this conversation.
[01:17:54.379 --> 01:17:55.440]  Your point of view doesn't matter.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.363]  But nobody ever defines what it is to be a sexist.
[01:17:58.383 --> 01:17:59.324]  What does that exactly mean?
[01:17:59.344 --> 01:18:00.645]  Or what does it mean to be a racist?
[01:18:01.065 --> 01:18:11.132]  As long as these terms are going to be career-ending, as long as they're going to be the most powerful terms we have to deploy in public conversation, shouldn't we define them with some precision so we know what they mean?
[01:18:11.512 --> 01:18:16.616]  And yet the people throwing them out have no incentive to define them because that would, of course, reduce their power.
[01:18:17.056 --> 01:18:24.501]  So you literally hear feminists on the one hand say, Donald Trump or whoever I don't agree with politically or who's against abortion is a sexist.
[01:18:25.126 --> 01:18:31.237]  And yet, they simultaneously make excuses for cultures that literally believe women aren't entirely human.
[01:18:32.104 --> 01:18:34.926]  So, maybe it's time to start defining things a little bit more.
[01:18:34.946 --> 01:18:42.730]  Well, I played a clip three times the last week of the Chicago, you know, basically riots against Trump, where a guy's interviewing some ladies that have Mexican flags.
[01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:53.355]  He's being polite to them, but, you know, they're basically saying racist stuff, and then the white woman comes over and says, these are women of color, you're a white male, you don't have a right to speak to them because of your male privilege.
[01:18:53.736 --> 01:18:53.976]  I know.
[01:18:54.036 --> 01:18:55.837]  And she's totally disconnected from reality.
[01:18:58.325 --> 01:19:00.246]  Why are the universities teaching this?
[01:19:00.326 --> 01:19:01.486]  I don't know where this is coming from.
[01:19:02.487 --> 01:19:05.408]  Well, I mean, they're teaching it because they're not challenged on it.
[01:19:05.568 --> 01:19:08.669]  I mean, look, it would be good to get back to first principles, okay?
[01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:10.449]  And to hold people accountable to those principles.
[01:19:10.529 --> 01:19:16.011]  And one of them is, you're not allowed to attack people on the basis of qualities they can't control, okay?
[01:19:16.431 --> 01:19:19.512]  That would be their gender, their skin color, their ethnicity.
[01:19:19.552 --> 01:19:21.352]  These are not things anyone's responsible for.
[01:19:21.372 --> 01:19:22.193]  They're things you're born with.
[01:19:22.493 --> 01:19:24.393]  And therefore, we don't hold people responsible for them.
[01:19:24.453 --> 01:19:26.154]  I don't hold you responsible for what your parents did.
[01:19:26.482 --> 01:19:28.242]  I don't hold you responsible for how tall you are.
[01:19:28.502 --> 01:19:30.363]  I hold you responsible for decisions that you make.
[01:19:30.703 --> 01:19:35.004]  And this used to be something that all good people, all liberals in the best sense, agreed on.
[01:19:35.344 --> 01:19:42.045]  And yet somehow, we've gotten to a place where it's okay to attack people based on these immutable characteristics.
[01:19:42.465 --> 01:19:52.767]  It seems to me, if you're going to fix America, and by fix I mean, help us get along better and stop hating each other so much, have a more prosperous, safer, more stable society, I think that's, we can all agree that's a good goal.
[01:19:53.127 --> 01:19:55.468]  Then really one of the very first things you need to say is,
[01:19:56.024 --> 01:19:56.905]  This is unacceptable.
[01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:58.788]  You're really not allowed to do that.
[01:19:58.888 --> 01:20:00.791]  And yet the left does it with impunity.
[01:20:00.831 --> 01:20:02.553]  They do it with high levels of aggression.
[01:20:02.593 --> 01:20:07.700]  The president himself does it all the time, writing people off because of the way they look or their race.
[01:20:08.081 --> 01:20:09.343]  What's the end game here?
[01:20:09.403 --> 01:20:10.484]  What do you think this winds up?
[01:20:10.825 --> 01:20:13.008]  If you tell people that they are hated,
[01:20:13.857 --> 01:20:17.398]  by others in their society for reasons that they can't control.
[01:20:17.438 --> 01:20:24.340]  Boy, you wind up creating conflict that does not go away, that's not resolved, and that winds up in a very ugly place down the line.
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:25.600]  And I think they're doing it.
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:28.241]  I don't know if they're doing it on purpose, but they're certainly doing it.
[01:20:29.221 --> 01:20:33.042]  What about Hillary Clinton saying, it's up on DailyColor.com right now,
[01:20:34.688 --> 01:20:36.450]  Saying that, hey, yeah, we'll give illegals health care.
[01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:37.991]  Well, they already get to come have their babies here.
[01:20:38.111 --> 01:20:43.676]  I'm not against people from China or Mexico or Eastern Europe, but I don't get to go have a baby for free.
[01:20:44.596 --> 01:20:46.378]  And, man, I pay a lot of taxes.
[01:20:46.418 --> 01:20:51.102]  And there's this attitude that, well, you're rich, you're an American, you should have to pay this stuff.
[01:20:51.622 --> 01:20:56.567]  Really, I saw the IRS try to take my grandfather's house after he and my grandmother were both sick.
[01:20:56.607 --> 01:20:57.708]  And it was a modest house.
[01:20:58.428 --> 01:21:03.191]  And then they had to basically sell it to give the IRS stuff they claim was back taxes that wasn't.
[01:21:03.511 --> 01:21:05.473]  So I don't know where my white privilege is.
[01:21:05.613 --> 01:21:12.998]  I've been arrested in New York for peacefully demonstrating against the Iraq War just because I didn't have any white privilege.
[01:21:13.038 --> 01:21:19.502]  Then I watched footage of Black Lives Matter and other groups attacking police in New York and the police do nothing.
[01:21:19.802 --> 01:21:23.204]  So in my experience, I don't know where this white privilege is.
[01:21:23.265 --> 01:21:25.106]  I'm really missing out on it, Tucker.
[01:21:25.703 --> 01:21:29.668]  Well, anyone who alleges that white privilege is by definition a racist.
[01:21:29.748 --> 01:21:31.570]  I mean, I think we can say that and we should say that.
[01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:34.233]  I mean, that's not a legitimate form of conversation.
[01:21:34.253 --> 01:21:36.355]  That's tarring an entire group based on the way they look.
[01:21:36.635 --> 01:21:40.340]  That's the definition of racism and I think people should just stand up and say that because it's true.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:47.821]  As for Hillary promising Obamacare to people here illegally, on so many levels this is shocking and it should be on the front page of the New York Times.
[01:21:47.881 --> 01:21:49.742]  It's not today because they have Donald Trump to hate.
[01:21:50.262 --> 01:21:53.002]  But this is one of the big lies of Obamacare.
[01:21:53.022 --> 01:21:56.543]  And I'm sorry, I don't want to sound like you're a garden variety right winger, but it's just true.
[01:21:56.963 --> 01:21:58.463]  So when they rolled this out, they claimed what?
[01:21:58.483 --> 01:21:59.464]  You could keep your coverage.
[01:21:59.504 --> 01:22:00.884]  They claimed it would reduce costs.
[01:22:01.064 --> 01:22:04.025]  And they said, above all, we're not going to give these benefits.
[01:22:04.045 --> 01:22:04.725]  $5,000 per year per person.
[01:22:06.585 --> 01:22:07.546]  That's right.
[01:22:07.586 --> 01:22:09.367]  It was a huge controversy.
[01:22:09.387 --> 01:22:10.968]  There are no death panels.
[01:22:10.988 --> 01:22:12.409]  There's no rationing of care.
[01:22:12.429 --> 01:22:13.310]  You can keep your doctor.
[01:22:13.330 --> 01:22:15.151]  We're not going to give illegals health care.
[01:22:15.171 --> 01:22:16.031]  But there it was in the bill.
[01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:38.087]  And they just countered the public.
[01:22:38.147 --> 01:22:41.470]  I remember MSNBC and CNN both said I was racist.
[01:22:42.251 --> 01:22:45.014]  Alex Jones is racist, deeply racist on MSNBC.
[01:22:45.434 --> 01:22:47.577]  He doesn't like Obamacare because Obama's black.
[01:22:47.937 --> 01:22:51.400]  No, my dad was in the medical care industry managing hundreds of clinics.
[01:22:51.881 --> 01:22:53.042]  He was getting ready to retire.
[01:22:53.162 --> 01:22:53.943]  He read the bill.
[01:22:54.243 --> 01:22:58.448]  He was a lobbyist at the state level and he was advising businesses to exit.
[01:22:58.908 --> 01:22:59.648]  You know, the country.
[01:23:00.029 --> 01:23:00.649]  He retired.
[01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:01.749]  I was an expert.
[01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.870]  I knew it was a scam.
[01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:06.592]  And they just called me a racist because I warned the American people it was a screwjob.
[01:23:07.432 --> 01:23:20.579]  Yeah, I mean, it's a shame that the president, who was elected eight years ago on this idea that he was going to unify the country, that he was a physical atonement for America's past sins, and we're going to move past all that and become a post-racial country.
[01:23:21.243 --> 01:23:22.925]  Which, by the way, I welcomed.
[01:23:23.025 --> 01:23:26.469]  I didn't vote for the guy because I disagree with him, but that part of it I really liked.
[01:23:26.549 --> 01:23:28.091]  I mean, that was a great promise.
[01:23:28.351 --> 01:23:28.691]  Me too.
[01:23:28.972 --> 01:23:37.301]  Instead, he has been the most racially, explicitly and intentionally racially divisive president we've ever had by a factor of I don't know how much.
[01:23:37.421 --> 01:23:38.762]  Let me ask you a bunch of questions, sir.
[01:23:38.782 --> 01:23:43.065]  We've got five minutes to break and I want to come back and go through what you think is most important in the election 2016.
[01:23:43.305 --> 01:23:46.947]  Tucker Carlson, TheDailyCaller.com, also Fox News contributor.
[01:23:47.448 --> 01:23:51.190]  He's one of the few people, I don't want to get him in trouble, at Fox that hasn't succumbed to Trump bashing.
[01:23:51.531 --> 01:23:56.494]  He and Hannity, I've really seen some behavior that is just bizarro because it's not fair.
[01:23:56.834 --> 01:23:58.976]  I mean, I expect that from MSNBC, I expect it.
[01:24:00.018 --> 01:24:12.381]  From CNBC, but it shows why the establishment so scared but getting into Trump and obviously the other channels are worse But man, I tell you why do you think from George Soros to the Republican leadership?
[01:24:13.261 --> 01:24:23.824]  To the Chinese communist that there is such a conniption fit over Trump and such a misrepresentation over the things he's saying and the total freakout because me personally I
[01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:27.749]  I'm worried he used to like Hillary Clinton, he used to work with these people.
[01:24:27.809 --> 01:24:28.990]  I'm worried this is rhetoric.
[01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:30.231]  It's not strong enough.
[01:24:31.632 --> 01:24:42.242]  But then I ask, why is the political establishment so scared when they know Obama told people, hey don't worry, I'm for NAFTA and GATT, I'm for globalism, I'm just claiming I'm against it.
[01:24:42.722 --> 01:24:47.687]  Why are they scared of Trump so much, in your expert opinion, Tucker Carlson?
[01:24:47.927 --> 01:24:49.008]  Well, there are a couple reasons.
[01:24:49.068 --> 01:24:53.411]  I mean, the obvious reasons are he says reckless things and he doesn't know much about policy.
[01:24:53.771 --> 01:24:54.692]  That is all true, by the way.
[01:24:54.732 --> 01:24:55.412]  That's completely true.
[01:24:55.432 --> 01:24:57.053]  Those are legitimate criticisms of Trump.
[01:24:57.694 --> 01:25:00.816]  There are also a lot of other things going on, especially in Washington.
[01:25:00.896 --> 01:25:02.837]  Trump came out and criticized the Iraq War.
[01:25:02.898 --> 01:25:03.418]  Think about it.
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:12.883]  Virtually every Republican in office or in some leadership position in the party, the RNC or the congressional committees, is implicated in the Bush administration in some way.
[01:25:12.923 --> 01:25:15.143]  That was, in effect, a personal attack on them.
[01:25:15.223 --> 01:25:18.164]  They resent it, they hate it, they take it personally.
[01:25:18.184 --> 01:25:20.425]  Trump doesn't want to attack countries that don't attack us.
[01:25:20.485 --> 01:25:21.645]  It's a manly position.
[01:25:22.025 --> 01:25:25.026]  By the way, 95% of Americans agree with that.
[01:25:25.046 --> 01:25:26.086]  I mean, this is the problem.
[01:25:28.749 --> 01:25:30.735]  Brutal, brooding about the Iraq War every day.
[01:25:31.076 --> 01:25:34.226]  But if you can't look back at the Iraq War and say, you know, that was a mistake.
[01:25:35.412 --> 01:25:37.893]  We did it for the right motives, but we blew it.
[01:25:38.173 --> 01:25:40.073]  I'm sorry, and we're not going to do it again.
[01:25:40.193 --> 01:25:42.174]  Trust us, we're not going to do anything reckless like that again.
[01:25:42.234 --> 01:25:46.955]  If the Republican Party had said that ten years ago, we wouldn't be having this conversation now.
[01:25:46.995 --> 01:25:53.997]  But instead, they enforced this ludicrous orthodoxy on their members, where nobody could say out loud what was obviously true, which was it didn't go very well.
[01:25:54.017 --> 01:25:54.297]  That's right.
[01:25:54.317 --> 01:26:01.359]  The Republicans should be endorsing him like Reagan, in my view, and thanking God he's atoning for stuff, and was against it at the time.
[01:26:01.419 --> 01:26:02.419]  That would be great for the party.
[01:26:02.970 --> 01:26:16.920]  Well, telling the truth in the end is always your best bet because, A, you don't have to remember what you said because you really believed it, and second, it kind of rings true with people and people appreciate that, especially now in this moment where everyone is required to lie all the time.
[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:17.701]  Nobody can say,
[01:26:18.061 --> 01:26:19.781]  What he really thinks for fear of being punished.
[01:26:19.801 --> 01:26:21.082]  I don't mean bigoted, hateful things.
[01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:23.342]  I mean, like, obvious, normal, common sense things.
[01:26:23.602 --> 01:26:27.043]  When was the last time you didn't say something you thought for fear of being punished?
[01:26:27.063 --> 01:26:31.564]  I mean, in your case, it probably doesn't apply, but for the average person, this is like a daily occurrence.
[01:26:31.804 --> 01:26:31.944]  Sure.
[01:26:31.984 --> 01:26:34.545]  And so to see someone like Trump come up and just say, you know, I don't even care.
[01:26:34.945 --> 01:26:36.605]  I'm so rich or crazy or whatever.
[01:26:36.645 --> 01:26:37.525]  I'm just gonna say what I think.
[01:26:37.605 --> 01:26:37.785]  Sure.
[01:26:37.825 --> 01:26:39.826]  That is thrilling, even if you disagree with him.
[01:26:39.886 --> 01:26:41.306]  And so that is a lot of it right there.
[01:26:41.326 --> 01:26:44.507]  And then the third point, which you obviously understand, is he's a direct threat.
[01:26:45.248 --> 01:26:49.473]  Yeah, the K Street people are literally crapping their pants.
[01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:05.431]  Even if Trump doesn't get the nomination, they've been exposed.
[01:27:05.451 --> 01:27:06.211]  Let me ask you this.
[01:27:07.112 --> 01:27:18.256]  Is it arrogance, fear, or stupidness that top Republicans come out and say, we don't care if you get the nomination, we're taking it, we're changing the rules today, we're going to drop you, we'd rather Hillary.
[01:27:18.616 --> 01:27:21.397]  I mean, even if they're going to cheat Trump, they shouldn't be saying it.
[01:27:21.637 --> 01:27:22.678]  It's a bad move.
[01:27:23.678 --> 01:27:24.698]  Or do you disagree with me?
[01:27:24.738 --> 01:27:26.079]  I mean, it just seems like they're crazy.
[01:27:26.699 --> 01:27:27.820]  They don't care, by the way.
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:31.164]  They have more in common with Hillary, a lot of them anyway, on foreign policy and economics.
[01:27:31.184 --> 01:27:32.505]  Sure, but why would they say it, Tucker?
[01:27:32.525 --> 01:27:33.125]  That's what I'm asking.
[01:27:33.966 --> 01:27:35.027]  Look, here's the point.
[01:27:35.428 --> 01:27:41.734]  Once they attacked him on identity politics grounds, once they said, not only are you wrong, but you're immoral, you're a racist, and you're a sexist.
[01:27:42.094 --> 01:27:48.277]  Once they compared him to Adolf Hitler, which they have a lot, they did today, in a magazine I used to work for in Washington, compared him to Hitler.
[01:27:48.637 --> 01:27:49.777]  You can't walk back from that.
[01:27:50.118 --> 01:27:53.379]  You can't- once you believe someone is Adolf Hitler- So they're totally committed?
[01:27:53.439 --> 01:27:54.159]  They're totally committed?
[01:27:54.319 --> 01:27:58.521]  They're totally- like a month later, you're not gonna say, yeah, he was Hitler, but now we kind of see eye to eye.
[01:27:58.761 --> 01:27:59.342]  It's over.
[01:27:59.662 --> 01:28:02.743]  You're never, you can't ever support the guy.
[01:28:02.843 --> 01:28:07.025]  And so they've gotten themselves into a position where, as they put it on Twitter, never Trump.
[01:28:07.594 --> 01:28:09.175]  And it just becomes more extreme from there.
[01:28:09.195 --> 01:28:11.655]  Once you compare someone to Hitler, it's not even worth arguing with.
[01:28:11.675 --> 01:28:11.915]  Sure.
[01:28:11.955 --> 01:28:13.116]  So they made the mistake.
[01:28:13.156 --> 01:28:16.897]  They think they have left cover because they're joining the liberal media.
[01:28:16.917 --> 01:28:18.277]  They're a bunch of old men, mainly.
[01:28:18.517 --> 01:28:19.638]  They're not computer savvy.
[01:28:19.998 --> 01:28:25.279]  They think because MSNBC and CNN suddenly like them, everything must be okay.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:29.181]  They have no idea that that is discrediting them like nothing they could ever do.
[01:28:29.241 --> 01:28:33.222]  These guys are basically self-immolating themselves in front of us, in my view.
[01:28:33.582 --> 01:28:34.303]  That is totally true.
[01:28:34.323 --> 01:28:40.471]  And by the way, if they disagree with his points on trader immigration, which is legitimate, many people do, explain why they're wrong.
[01:28:40.571 --> 01:28:42.013]  Tell me why we should have open borders.
[01:28:42.033 --> 01:28:45.218]  Yeah, don't use leftist ideology just calling him Hitler and a racist.
[01:28:46.101 --> 01:28:47.081]  It's not even ideology!
[01:28:47.122 --> 01:28:48.242]  It's like the lowest tactic.
[01:28:48.282 --> 01:28:49.863]  What they're basically saying is, shut up.
[01:28:50.343 --> 01:28:54.025]  They're not answering any of his arguments, to the extent he has arguments.
[01:28:54.045 --> 01:28:56.046]  They're not rebutting his positions.
[01:28:56.066 --> 01:28:58.107]  They're just telling him to be quiet and go away.
[01:28:58.147 --> 01:29:00.788]  That's, you know, mommy wants you to shut up, so please do.
[01:29:01.229 --> 01:29:02.789]  That's not an adult response.
[01:29:02.829 --> 01:29:07.152]  Like, what is the argument for bringing Syrian refugees to America?
[01:29:07.172 --> 01:29:08.652]  They're so offended that it's crazy.
[01:29:09.133 --> 01:29:10.053]  What's the argument for it?
[01:29:10.313 --> 01:29:11.734]  I haven't heard what the argument for it is.
[01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:15.055]  I'm open!
[01:29:15.216 --> 01:29:17.417]  Convince me!
[01:29:17.437 --> 01:29:21.379]  Tell me why I should bring the most hateful radical Islamists to America.
[01:29:21.639 --> 01:29:22.419]  Please explain it to me.
[01:29:22.599 --> 01:29:24.080]  Look how good it's going for Europe today.
[01:29:25.031 --> 01:29:27.873]  Yeah, but they don't bother, so it's, hey, you're Hitler, shut up.
[01:29:28.453 --> 01:29:35.658]  And really, he has, and I'm not, again, endorsing Trump, and I have real concerns about Trump, because I don't think he learns- Sure, but you're saying the attack's illegitimate.
[01:29:35.678 --> 01:29:36.539]  Tucker Carlson, stay there.
[01:29:36.719 --> 01:29:37.579]  Come back, you'll have the floor.
[01:29:37.599 --> 01:29:38.200]  Let's go over it.
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:47.066]  And I'm going to play some clips of social justice warriors calling for the end of free speech, and a lot more, and Trump warning that Brussels, Belgium is a hellhole.
[01:29:47.486 --> 01:29:49.248]  My reporters were there when he said that.
[01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:56.578]  They couldn't go through half the city without having radical Muslims just come running, screaming at him, trying to run over him with cars.
[01:29:57.078 --> 01:29:58.680]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:59.601 --> 01:30:02.305]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:06.619 --> 01:30:14.921]  A wave of bombings that killed at least 30 people in Brussels was carried out by ISIS militants, the group has claimed, reports The Independent.
[01:30:15.141 --> 01:30:22.943]  In a statement released through one of its propaganda outlets, the so-called Islamic State said, explosive belts and devices were used.
[01:30:23.243 --> 01:30:26.464]  Islamic State fighters opened fire inside of an airport.
[01:30:26.644 --> 01:30:33.648]  before several of them detonated their explosive belts as a martyrdom bomber detonated his explosive belt in a metro station.
[01:30:33.908 --> 01:30:39.410]  A spokesperson said the attacks resulted in more than 230 dead and wounded.
[01:30:39.791 --> 01:30:46.614]  ISIS said Belgium was targeted as a country participating in the international coalition against the Islamic State.
[01:30:46.854 --> 01:30:54.658]  The timing of the attacks coming days after the arrest of a Paris suspect was considered significant but no mention of the captured militant was made.
[01:30:55.038 --> 01:31:01.645]  As the death toll rose amid continuing rescue operations, ISIS supporters had been championing the attacks on Twitter.
[01:31:01.905 --> 01:31:05.769]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:31:06.029 --> 01:31:09.212]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:09.533 --> 01:31:14.618]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:31:14.738 --> 01:31:17.539]  And optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:17.759 --> 01:31:19.620]  Just one of the key compounds.

[01:33:02.394 --> 01:33:03.655]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:03.735 --> 01:33:23.451]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:58.803 --> 01:34:07.409]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was just talking to Tim Kennedy, famous Green Beret, all sorts of secretive army grips he's part of, we can't mention on air.
[01:34:07.429 --> 01:34:10.732]  He'll be with us for a full hour coming up after Tucker Carlson leaves us.
[01:34:10.752 --> 01:34:17.997]  We're gonna have Joe Biggs and Paul Watson popping in for questions from London and right here in Texas with Tucker Carlson here in about eight minutes.
[01:34:18.677 --> 01:34:22.040]  But I tell you, during the three-minute break I was almost late getting back in here because
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:38.770]  There's a reason the establishment obviously doesn't want people like Tim Kennedy to start getting on radio and TV and talking about politics, because I'm back there during the break and just everything coming out of his mouth is just dead on with what's happening in this country, in this world.
[01:34:39.071 --> 01:34:46.796]  And that's why I continue to say our military, especially special ops people, but the military period, are the most awake, informed folks.
[01:34:46.836 --> 01:34:52.520]  I mean, they are the polar opposite of dumbed-down communist social justice warriors at the colleges.
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:35:02.063]  Who, I'm sorry, look like self-propelled stomachs, hate freedom, hate this country, hate everybody including themselves, love jihadists though, and hate our military.
[01:35:02.664 --> 01:35:03.384]  So it's amazing.
[01:35:03.904 --> 01:35:06.245]  But Tim, you've got a lot coming up today.
[01:35:06.265 --> 01:35:12.067]  We're about to go back to Tucker Carlson, but just briefly talking to you in there as you stand in front of the George Washington banner.
[01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:16.629]  Overall, what are some of the things you're going to be covering in the third hour with us, my friend?
[01:35:19.208 --> 01:35:31.700]  There's a shift right now where we keep talking about domestic terrorism, guys in Oregon, or people at Trump rallies, where the emphasis and the entire focus needs to be on what's really going on right now.
[01:35:33.241 --> 01:35:37.805]  Brussels is an example, San Bernardino, Boston, Paris.
[01:35:37.845 --> 01:35:45.232]  This is not going to stop until we recognize and understand and have a shift, a paradigm shift, of where we are focusing and what we're talking about.
[01:35:45.652 --> 01:35:47.093]  Political correctness has to go away.
[01:35:47.413 --> 01:35:50.155]  We need to wake up as a nation because things are getting scary.
[01:35:51.055 --> 01:35:51.676]  Absolutely.
[01:35:52.196 --> 01:35:56.399]  I tell you, a few guys can sit there next to George Washington and actually compliment him.
[01:35:56.679 --> 01:35:58.080]  How do you like standing next to old George there?
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.580]  I'm humbled, you know.
[01:36:00.101 --> 01:36:00.621]  That's the man.
[01:36:00.661 --> 01:36:07.445]  You want to talk about a guy that understood what terrorism is, what tyranny is, and did something to change that.
[01:36:07.705 --> 01:36:08.246]  That's this guy.
[01:36:09.059 --> 01:36:10.840]  Well, I can't wait to have you in studio, my friend.
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:12.742]  I hope we can get Shane Steiner in here as well.
[01:36:13.403 --> 01:36:14.744]  But thank you for joining us today.
[01:36:15.204 --> 01:36:16.045]  It'll be fun.
[01:36:16.065 --> 01:36:27.834]  All right, that's Tim Kennedy coming up in the third hour today, and then hosting the fourth hour today, we're going to have Rob Dew, going back to Tucker Carlson of TheDailyCaller.com.
[01:36:28.495 --> 01:36:30.857]  That's a good point that Mr. Kennedy just brought up.
[01:36:31.377 --> 01:36:42.823]  I mean, you see Hillary, Homeland Security, Obama, Big Sis, then Holder, now Lynch, saying, no, the number one threat is veterans, gun owners, patriots, conservatives.
[01:36:43.163 --> 01:36:45.064]  We need the IRS to target Christians.
[01:36:45.944 --> 01:36:47.765]  MSNBC doesn't even back away from that.
[01:36:47.805 --> 01:36:48.545]  They're proud of it.
[01:36:48.826 --> 01:36:50.086]  The persecution of people.
[01:36:50.566 --> 01:36:55.609]  There's almost no right-wing terrorism in this country, but they don't want to worry about Islamic terror.
[01:36:55.629 --> 01:36:56.569]  They want to obsess on that.
[01:36:56.609 --> 01:36:57.510]  What do you think's behind that?
[01:36:58.106 --> 01:37:02.068]  Well, self-hatred, of course, and a loathing of America's middle class.
[01:37:02.128 --> 01:37:04.270]  And it's not, you know, it's not just on the left, by the way.
[01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:08.752]  It's on full display right now on the right in Washington, New York and Los Angeles.
[01:37:08.772 --> 01:37:12.155]  They just hate people who live between Brentwood and Georgetown.
[01:37:12.195 --> 01:37:15.937]  I mean, they're considered, you know, mouth breathers, idiots, proto Klansmen.
[01:37:15.957 --> 01:37:17.238]  They just don't like them.
[01:37:17.418 --> 01:37:22.581]  And so that's why you see the president and Hillary Clinton and
[01:37:23.574 --> 01:37:28.978]  You know, the head of the DOJ at every turn blame Americans first.
[01:37:29.379 --> 01:37:31.280]  This happened because you're intolerant.
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:32.381]  You're bigots.
[01:37:32.701 --> 01:37:34.222]  You're contributing to global warming.
[01:37:34.262 --> 01:37:36.104]  You drive a suburban and don't like black people.
[01:37:36.144 --> 01:37:36.984]  That's why this happened.
[01:37:37.004 --> 01:37:39.586]  I mean, it's that's their first instinct every time.
[01:37:39.766 --> 01:37:41.988]  And I'm just kind of surprised how nobody ever calls them out again.
[01:37:42.288 --> 01:37:48.853]  The president, in his remarks from Havana this morning, the first thing he said was, you know, racism.
[01:37:49.349 --> 01:37:54.659]  This is what happens when you don't come together and you don't like people on the basis of their skin color.
[01:37:54.719 --> 01:37:54.979]  Really?
[01:37:55.019 --> 01:37:55.761]  That's the lesson?
[01:37:56.142 --> 01:37:57.224]  That America's racist?
[01:37:57.524 --> 01:37:58.606]  No, that's not the lesson.
[01:37:58.626 --> 01:38:00.670]  The lesson is we're being attacked.
[01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:01.672]  It's not our fault.
[01:38:02.347 --> 01:38:03.388]  And we should fight back.
[01:38:03.809 --> 01:38:05.070]  But that's not the lesson he draws.
[01:38:05.391 --> 01:38:06.773]  And by the way, we have the clip.
[01:38:07.233 --> 01:38:18.727]  It's up on Infowars.com where Obama apologizes to Raul Castro, a dictator that has hundreds of thousands in political prisons, for America and says, please advise us how to be better.
[01:38:19.788 --> 01:38:21.690]  Most of their houses are collapsing.
[01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:23.692]  People live in government shelters.
[01:38:23.752 --> 01:38:25.073]  The state raises the kids.
[01:38:25.573 --> 01:38:27.015]  They can't make an automobile.
[01:38:27.435 --> 01:38:31.458]  And we're going to be lectured by a Caribbean dictatorship.
[01:38:32.019 --> 01:38:33.981]  It is surreal for me to see this happen.
[01:38:34.001 --> 01:38:35.662]  Well, it's totally surreal.
[01:38:36.943 --> 01:38:41.688]  I've been upset about the Obama administration for a number of years, but I was actually shocked by that.
[01:38:42.089 --> 01:38:53.421]  When I saw Obama apologize for, you know, the Spanish-American War of 1898, we lived, you know, we kicked out the Spanish, but we did so because we wanted influence over Cuba.
[01:38:53.601 --> 01:38:54.663]  We're apologizing?
[01:38:54.863 --> 01:38:55.664]  Are you kidding?
[01:38:56.144 --> 01:39:04.814]  To the Castros who led this crackdown of dissidents, people just hoping to exercise, you know, the freedom to speak what they think before Obama got there.
[01:39:04.834 --> 01:39:05.795]  He doesn't even mention that.
[01:39:05.875 --> 01:39:07.937]  I mean, the whole thing is so demented.
[01:39:07.997 --> 01:39:09.279]  It's so upside down.
[01:39:09.639 --> 01:39:11.381]  And the coverage of it is just appalling.
[01:39:11.401 --> 01:39:16.387]  And I don't want to just be, again, another right-winger complaining about the media coverage, but I've been in it my whole life.
[01:39:16.887 --> 01:39:18.388]  And I've never seen it like this.
[01:39:18.448 --> 01:39:23.452]  I mean, the Washington Post every day is just this roster of Trump is Hitler stories, and there's no coverage!
[01:39:23.552 --> 01:39:27.456]  Sure, you know under Bush, I got criticized as a super leftist because I didn't like a lot of things.
[01:39:27.476 --> 01:39:30.118]  Bush was doing Patriot Act wars, but, but...
[01:39:30.737 --> 01:39:36.181]  I gotta say, I mean, even Jonathan Turley, the big liberal constitutional lawyer, says Obama is three times worse than Bush.
[01:39:36.441 --> 01:39:37.362]  Well, that was five years ago.
[01:39:37.402 --> 01:39:38.623]  How about ten times worse?
[01:39:38.663 --> 01:39:40.164]  I mean, I'm just calling it like it is.
[01:39:40.224 --> 01:39:40.965]  This is crazy.
[01:39:41.345 --> 01:39:42.786]  And it's almost like a deviance.
[01:39:43.386 --> 01:39:45.288]  Like, let's blame Christians.
[01:39:45.348 --> 01:39:46.329]  Let's blame America.
[01:39:46.869 --> 01:39:50.712]  Oh, let's listen to communist dictators to tell us how to run things, Mr. Dictator.
[01:39:51.032 --> 01:39:54.155]  It is so comical if it wasn't so serious, Tucker.
[01:39:54.195 --> 01:39:54.315]  Right.
[01:39:54.735 --> 01:39:55.556]  And it is deviant.
[01:39:55.576 --> 01:39:56.416]  You're exactly right.
[01:39:56.476 --> 01:39:58.638]  And I don't fully understand the psychology of it.
[01:39:58.678 --> 01:39:59.939]  I grew up in a liberal neighborhood.
[01:40:00.359 --> 01:40:11.629]  So I have a gut feeling for it, but anything that is perverse, or unattractive, or unhealthy, or mean, or against sort of, you know, normal people, is what they gravitate toward.
[01:40:11.649 --> 01:40:12.950]  I don't understand it.
[01:40:13.650 --> 01:40:21.697]  You see it with this transgender stuff, and I have mixed feelings about it, because I have no ill will toward transgender people, and I think you ought to be able to dress however you want, or whatever.
[01:40:22.237 --> 01:40:26.461]  But the aggression with which they've pushed it on everybody else, and anybody who thinks it's
[01:40:26.872 --> 01:40:30.993]  You know, it's sad that someone might want to change his gender since that's of course physically impossible.
[01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:36.034]  We just lost Tucker Carlson's Skype.
[01:40:36.534 --> 01:40:38.715]  Tucker, you were getting into gender impossible to change.
[01:40:38.735 --> 01:40:39.435]  Your Skype broke up.
[01:40:39.475 --> 01:40:39.715]  Go ahead.
[01:40:40.855 --> 01:40:41.216]  Whatever.
[01:40:41.256 --> 01:40:44.336]  I'm not here to attack transgender people.
[01:40:44.396 --> 01:40:45.076]  I'm not either.
[01:40:45.197 --> 01:40:47.057]  I'm wondering why it's the number one issue.
[01:40:47.457 --> 01:40:55.119]  I just find it amazing that as the world collapses, as the world order established after World War II is literally crumbling in front of us.
[01:40:56.435 --> 01:41:00.119]  The left spends so much time worrying about transgendered backgrounds.
[01:41:00.159 --> 01:41:00.480]  That's it!
[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:02.462]  I could care less about people doing whatever.
[01:41:02.502 --> 01:41:08.489]  I'm a libertarian, but why is it all I turn on TV with my kids, even on Nickelodeon, it's about trannies?
[01:41:08.569 --> 01:41:10.772]  I mean, since when did we become planet tranny?
[01:41:13.592 --> 01:41:14.612]  There goes the Skype again.
[01:41:14.632 --> 01:41:15.873]  I guess you say Planet Training.
[01:41:15.893 --> 01:41:16.633]  The Skype breaks up.
[01:41:16.653 --> 01:41:17.513]  You're not allowed to say that.
[01:41:18.273 --> 01:41:19.494]  Tucker Carlson is our guest.
[01:41:19.514 --> 01:41:20.654]  Joe Biggs is in the other studio.
[01:41:20.694 --> 01:41:23.135]  He has some breaking news on the situation.
[01:41:23.915 --> 01:41:29.037]  While we get Tucker Carlson back on Skype right now, Paul Watson will pop back in from London, England.
[01:41:29.537 --> 01:41:31.297]  Going to Joe Biggs while we get Tucker back up.
[01:41:32.038 --> 01:41:34.478]  Joe, breaking news on the situation.
[01:41:35.058 --> 01:41:36.219]  Tim Kennedy makes a great point.
[01:41:36.299 --> 01:41:41.000]  Why are we obsessed about libertarian or right-wing or patriot terror when it's almost non-existent?
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:43.161]  But jihad terror, we're told, doesn't exist.
[01:41:44.465 --> 01:41:46.246]  Because it goes against the narrative that they're pushing.
[01:41:46.286 --> 01:41:47.426]  They want us to be accepting.
[01:41:47.706 --> 01:41:50.528]  They want us to allow these people to come in so they can destroy our country.
[01:41:50.828 --> 01:41:52.589]  That's why Bernie Sanders is so popular.
[01:41:52.889 --> 01:41:54.689]  They want something like that.
[01:41:54.749 --> 01:42:04.374]  It makes no sense why this is such a popular thing right now to go after these patriot groups who are literally standing up for good reason.
[01:42:04.414 --> 01:42:13.538]  The fact that the BLM is actually taking their land in mass numbers versus a group of people who are actually radical
[01:42:14.338 --> 01:42:20.664]  Beheading people, throwing homosexuals off bridges, going and beheading people, killing them, murdering them, raping them.
[01:42:21.744 --> 01:42:30.712]  I just don't understand why there's such this fascination with these domestic terrorists that I think is completely and totally out of this world.
[01:42:30.752 --> 01:42:32.133]  I mean, there's nothing really going on.
[01:42:32.514 --> 01:42:35.636]  And then we're not to worry about these guys coming over here.
[01:42:36.477 --> 01:42:36.637]  I don't
[01:42:52.671 --> 01:43:01.620]  And obviously it's an impossible job for the police and counter-terrorism forces once you bring in, like Brussels has done the last two years, half a million people from radical areas.
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:06.905]  It's impossible once you open the gates and bring people in to protect everybody.
[01:43:06.985 --> 01:43:08.347]  The border is where you do that.
[01:43:08.567 --> 01:43:15.608]  CNBC is tweeting out right now that the Obama administration is expected to announce new measures to tighten security at U.S.
[01:43:15.728 --> 01:43:17.949]  airports following the Brussels attacks.
[01:43:18.309 --> 01:43:21.250]  And then you also have presidential candidate Ted Cruz coming out.
[01:43:21.610 --> 01:43:36.453]  Just not too long ago, Travis actually sent me a video where he comes out and says, due to the nature of Donald Trump's words that he spoke, what he said yesterday at AIPAC, this is the reason why these attacks in Brussels happened, because he said that we shouldn't have as much
[01:43:39.249 --> 01:43:39.549]  Time!
[01:43:39.569 --> 01:43:40.670]  We shouldn't work with NATO!
[01:43:40.970 --> 01:43:42.812]  And they said, because Brussels is... I know, it's crazy.
[01:43:42.832 --> 01:43:44.973]  He's pointing out NATO helped back ISIS and al Qaeda.
[01:43:45.254 --> 01:43:46.435]  Thank you, Joe, for that pop-up.
[01:43:46.455 --> 01:43:47.636]  We'll come back to you in the next segment.
[01:43:47.916 --> 01:43:49.657]  We do have Tucker Carlson back via Skype.
[01:43:50.338 --> 01:43:52.699]  Tucker, I've been ranting here and bringing up a lot of my points.
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:56.923]  Dailycaller.com, of course, you're one of the founders and owners of that major site.
[01:43:57.981 --> 01:43:58.261]  We're good.
[01:44:13.229 --> 01:44:18.772]  Even if Trump has problems, shouldn't they be cautiously supporting him, trying to influence him in a good way?
[01:44:18.812 --> 01:44:20.392]  They won't even meet with him, the leadership.
[01:44:21.033 --> 01:44:24.034]  And then they say, we'd rather destroy the party and get Hillary elected.
[01:44:24.054 --> 01:44:26.675]  I mean, that really proves it's a one-party system.
[01:44:26.955 --> 01:44:30.357]  Where do you see all that going and what other big issues are on your plate?
[01:44:31.137 --> 01:44:33.638]  Well, the party isn't being destroyed, it's being reborn.
[01:44:33.879 --> 01:44:37.140]  Whether you agree with it or not, but I mean, political parties exist to serve their voters.
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:38.901]  I mean, that's the only reason we have them.
[01:44:39.546 --> 01:44:41.228]  And they change.
[01:44:41.368 --> 01:44:44.893]  Ultimately, they have to change to respond to the things that actual voters care about.
[01:44:45.353 --> 01:44:52.602]  America's economy, its demography, everything about it has changed dramatically in the last 20 years and the Republican Party hasn't.
[01:44:52.642 --> 01:44:53.263]  That's okay.
[01:44:53.363 --> 01:44:54.865]  This has happened a lot in American history.
[01:44:55.305 --> 01:45:00.067]  Where the parties are, you know, lagging indicators of reality, but at some point they have to catch up.
[01:45:00.107 --> 01:45:01.128]  And that's what you're seeing now.
[01:45:01.168 --> 01:45:04.129]  And so what you're seeing is not, again, the destruction of the Republican Party.
[01:45:04.509 --> 01:45:10.371]  What you're seeing is the imminent exile of the people who run the Republican Party to somewhere else.
[01:45:10.451 --> 01:45:12.672]  I mean, they're obviously not on board and that's fine.
[01:45:13.033 --> 01:45:16.234]  But the party itself is becoming something very, very different.
[01:45:16.864 --> 01:45:17.924]  Um, and it should.
[01:45:18.085 --> 01:45:22.426]  I'm not saying it should go full crazy populist or anything like that, but I'm saying it does need to adjust.
[01:45:22.846 --> 01:45:23.547]  Think of it this way.
[01:45:23.767 --> 01:45:31.449]  For all the attention they get, the people in Washington who truly hate Trump and never Trump people, um, it's a pretty small group.
[01:45:31.650 --> 01:45:36.611]  I mean, I don't know what percentage of the population of America they comprise, but I mean, way under 1%.
[01:45:36.992 --> 01:45:40.513]  I think your point about influencing him is the smartest of all points that nobody ever makes.
[01:45:41.013 --> 01:45:48.017]  Look, if you disagree with Trump, if you think he's uninformed on the issues, and I think he is uninformed on some of the issues, why not inform him?
[01:45:48.457 --> 01:45:49.398]  Why not suborn him?
[01:45:49.778 --> 01:45:58.143]  Rather than saying you're going to beat him in a street fight, which you're not, because you're a pudgy, soft-handed, little intellectual dork from D.C., you're never going to beat Trump in a fight, of course, and they haven't.
[01:45:58.363 --> 01:46:00.244]  They spent half a billion dollars trying to beat him and they haven't.
[01:46:00.982 --> 01:46:02.365]  Why don't you try to win him over?
[01:46:02.385 --> 01:46:03.588]  Why don't you try to inform him?
[01:46:03.628 --> 01:46:05.953]  Why don't you try and transfer some of your ideas to him?
[01:46:06.313 --> 01:46:07.496]  Go down to Florida and meet with him.
[01:46:07.516 --> 01:46:10.622]  Tucker, I hate to even say this because it's inside baseball and they'll run with it.
[01:46:10.642 --> 01:46:11.464]  I don't want to hurt Trump.
[01:46:12.412 --> 01:46:14.553]  Trump listens to what we say.
[01:46:14.573 --> 01:46:16.194]  They tell us, watch next week.
[01:46:16.234 --> 01:46:17.354]  I'm coming out against the Federal Reserve.
[01:46:17.394 --> 01:46:18.054]  Watch next week.
[01:46:18.454 --> 01:46:24.097]  And then I personally have talked to him some off air, and he literally is either the biggest manipulator ever, or he's for real.
[01:46:24.957 --> 01:46:28.078]  He literally listens to what I and others say.
[01:46:28.138 --> 01:46:28.819]  It's amazing.
[01:46:29.339 --> 01:46:31.240]  Other people don't even think about trying to inform him.
[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:36.602]  I mean, if you're not arrogant and you go up and actually talk to Trump, he will listen to you.
[01:46:37.202 --> 01:46:37.722]  Exactly.
[01:46:37.963 --> 01:46:38.423]  Exactly.
[01:46:38.503 --> 01:46:41.665]  So why not go down to Florida and say, look, Mr. Trump, you're great.
[01:46:41.705 --> 01:46:43.586]  You've done a great job expanding the Republican Party.
[01:46:43.606 --> 01:46:44.407]  I think you're awesome.
[01:46:44.747 --> 01:46:46.548]  But here's the thing about trade that you should know.
[01:46:46.729 --> 01:46:47.069]  Whatever.
[01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:49.290]  I mean, or try to convince him, try to win him over.
[01:46:49.731 --> 01:46:56.595]  Calling him a Nazi is not the same as debating him or trying to suborn him or do things that adults do.
[01:46:56.615 --> 01:47:01.939]  Like, look, nobody in a position of leadership goes to war as a first option.
[01:47:02.319 --> 01:47:03.220]  The Romans didn't.
[01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:04.101]  The Ottomans didn't.
[01:47:04.221 --> 01:47:07.825]  No wise ruler immediately declares war on his opponents.
[01:47:08.165 --> 01:47:09.527]  He tries to negotiate first.
[01:47:09.567 --> 01:47:10.047]  He tries to win.
[01:47:10.308 --> 01:47:10.928]  That's the thing.
[01:47:11.009 --> 01:47:16.935]  Trump is really nice if you're successful and you've been successful and he will listen to you and at least take the counsel.
[01:47:17.175 --> 01:47:19.518]  But if you attack him first, he listens to nothing you say.
[01:47:19.926 --> 01:47:21.247]  But everybody's like that!
[01:47:21.407 --> 01:47:23.789]  I'm like that, you're like that, most people are like that.
[01:47:24.129 --> 01:47:34.596]  And everybody, most people operate that way, except the leaders of the Republican Party, who were so stupid, and so walled off in their tiny little world, that they thought they could make this guy go away.
[01:47:34.616 --> 01:47:39.180]  And the reason they thought that was, they didn't take him seriously, and they didn't take his voters seriously.
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:40.521]  They don't care what their voters think.
[01:47:40.841 --> 01:47:42.242]  They think their voters are stupid.
[01:47:42.662 --> 01:47:45.244]  They are snake handling evangelicals in the South.
[01:47:45.723 --> 01:47:52.877]  They're idiot Oxycontin addicted, you know, dumb people in Appalachia, and they're survivalists out West.
[01:47:52.977 --> 01:47:56.605]  And they can just shut up and vote for the nominee that the party gives them.
[01:47:56.685 --> 01:47:57.667]  And by the way, that's worked?
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:02.183]  But it has stopped working this cycle, and they refuse to acknowledge that.
[01:48:02.223 --> 01:48:04.665]  At some point you have to engage your own voters, you have to listen to them.
[01:48:04.945 --> 01:48:08.788]  Maybe you moderate them, you try to bring them along, but you have to reach some accommodation.
[01:48:09.028 --> 01:48:12.070]  You can't just give them the finger and tell them you're going to impose something on them.
[01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:13.691]  That doesn't work in a democracy.
[01:48:13.931 --> 01:48:15.453]  And you'd think they would know that, but they didn't.
[01:48:15.813 --> 01:48:18.195]  And now they're going to be punished and destroyed for it.
[01:48:18.235 --> 01:48:22.878]  And by the way, even though I'm not fully on board with Trump, I have some concerns.
[01:48:23.283 --> 01:48:25.965]  I have zero sympathy for the people who run the Republican Party.
[01:48:25.985 --> 01:48:26.805]  Well, that's my issue.
[01:48:26.825 --> 01:48:27.586]  I have a lot of issues with Trump.
[01:48:27.606 --> 01:48:29.367]  I think they're corrupt and horrible.
[01:48:29.707 --> 01:48:32.209]  I think they deserve to lose their purchase of power.
[01:48:32.409 --> 01:48:38.633]  They live in the richest city in the world, and the only reason it is is because it's close physically to those in power.
[01:48:39.013 --> 01:48:45.898]  I think the whole arrangement is disgusting, and they deserve to be replaced by people who are a little smarter and a little more responsive to actual Americans.
[01:48:45.958 --> 01:48:46.598]  I do think that.
[01:48:47.179 --> 01:48:51.842]  And I see the Republican and Democratic leadership as just completely arrogant, out of touch, like never before.
[01:48:53.165 --> 01:49:04.052]  The sad thing about the Trump story is it's obscured this amazing thing that's happening on the left, where Hillary Clinton has been revealed as someone who does not represent her party at all.
[01:49:04.552 --> 01:49:07.754]  Hillary Clinton is totally out of step with the Democratic base.
[01:49:08.155 --> 01:49:13.378]  The only reason that's not obvious is because she's done what every Democratic president for my lifetime has done.
[01:49:13.769 --> 01:49:19.015]  Which is scare minority voters into supporting him or her through accusations of racism.
[01:49:19.035 --> 01:49:19.416]  That's right.
[01:49:19.456 --> 01:49:20.817]  She's stolen it from Sanders.
[01:49:20.837 --> 01:49:21.999]  As much as I hate him, it's true.
[01:49:22.299 --> 01:49:24.181]  She stole it early on, but it's okay.
[01:49:24.421 --> 01:49:27.745]  Now the Republicans are getting ready to change the rules and steal it from Trump.
[01:49:27.825 --> 01:49:29.027]  This is insane.
[01:49:29.267 --> 01:49:30.769]  Let's play a clip of one of these liberals.
[01:49:32.451 --> 01:49:38.682]  You may have seen it, because Handy played this, where she's sitting there saying, you're not allowed to interview a woman of color because you're white.
[01:49:38.862 --> 01:49:44.372]  It is this insane racism and self-loathing that is just over the top.
[01:49:44.412 --> 01:49:44.872]  Here's the clip.
[01:49:45.723 --> 01:49:54.706]  So I'm saying no, you do not have permission to walk around videotaping women of color and acting like you can do that and the rest of us can't.
[01:49:54.826 --> 01:50:00.648]  Aren't you quite aware by holding that video camera on me that you are surrounded by your privilege, right?
[01:50:00.928 --> 01:50:03.789]  Take your privilege somewhere else, please.
[01:50:03.869 --> 01:50:04.670]  All right?
[01:50:05.190 --> 01:50:07.491]  Because your privilege is not welcome here.
[01:50:07.751 --> 01:50:14.133]  So unless you are here to dismantle your privilege, please find somewhere else to go.
[01:50:15.011 --> 01:50:16.994]  That's the rebel pundit with that info.
[01:50:17.054 --> 01:50:21.981]  And it just goes on and on with, in the same clip as them saying, we're communists, we're gonna kill you.
[01:50:22.001 --> 01:50:23.544]  And they come up and say, you're gonna kill?
[01:50:23.564 --> 01:50:25.907]  And they go, oh no, I don't mean literally kill.
[01:50:26.328 --> 01:50:30.414]  I mean, where do these rich yuppie kids crawl out from under a rock?
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:33.001]  Well, yeah, I'm sure I don't know who that woman is.
[01:50:33.061 --> 01:50:34.542]  I'm sure she has tenure somewhere.
[01:50:34.602 --> 01:50:37.363]  I'm sure I'm sending her money every month to educate my kids.
[01:50:37.443 --> 01:50:37.984]  Yeah.
[01:50:38.304 --> 01:50:39.204]  The irony's about.
[01:50:39.605 --> 01:50:41.386]  But I guess I just take three steps back.
[01:50:41.446 --> 01:50:48.810]  Where do you think this ends up when you encourage stuff like this, when you encourage groups of people to hate each other based on immutable characteristics like skin color?
[01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:50.671]  What do you think the endgame is?
[01:50:50.691 --> 01:50:53.013]  The endgame is something really, really ugly.
[01:50:53.033 --> 01:50:54.034]  Look at the rest of the world.
[01:50:54.054 --> 01:50:54.735]  Tucker, stay there.
[01:50:54.935 --> 01:50:55.255]  Stay there.
[01:50:55.275 --> 01:50:56.857]  Tucker Carlson, DailyCaller.com.
[01:50:57.037 --> 01:51:04.063]  I'm going to come back and ask the Fox pundit where he thinks the endgame is going in our final segment, straight ahead.
[01:51:04.143 --> 01:51:06.966]  Then, Tim Kennedy, Black Ops Commander, in studio.
[01:51:09.594 --> 01:51:16.058]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[01:51:16.999 --> 01:51:19.781]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[01:51:20.601 --> 01:51:24.304]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[01:51:24.964 --> 01:51:26.204]  I said, let me see.
[01:51:26.765 --> 01:51:37.368]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[01:51:37.848 --> 01:51:48.971]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[01:51:49.932 --> 01:51:50.612]  How about you?

[01:52:07.555 --> 01:52:09.056]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:52:09.376 --> 01:52:10.656]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:52:11.017 --> 01:52:13.337]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:52:13.838 --> 01:52:15.698]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:52:16.138 --> 01:52:20.180]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:52:38.246 --> 01:52:38.827]  Over-stressed?

[01:52:39.627 --> 01:52:45.091]  The solution is to oxygenate your cells because disease cannot survive in an oxygen-rich environment.

[01:54:10.544 --> 01:54:14.345]  Alright, it's our final segment of the hour with Tucker Carlson of DailyCaller.com.
[01:54:15.645 --> 01:54:16.665]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:54:17.385 --> 01:54:22.146]  And again, a lot of other sites and people don't promote other news sites and things.
[01:54:22.166 --> 01:54:22.786]  Look, I don't care.
[01:54:22.806 --> 01:54:29.748]  As long as you're promoting freedom, the Second Amendment, private property, and national sovereignty, and you're not anti-free speech, I support you.
[01:54:29.768 --> 01:54:30.768]  Daily Caller is great.
[01:54:31.128 --> 01:54:31.988]  Drudge Report's great.
[01:54:32.088 --> 01:54:33.029]  WorldNet Daily's great.
[01:54:33.489 --> 01:54:34.509]  InfoWars is great.
[01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:38.530]  There's a lot of other really big sites out there that actually cover real issues.
[01:54:38.650 --> 01:54:39.630]  It's scary.
[01:54:40.690 --> 01:54:42.371]  Uh, that there's just so much garbage.
[01:54:42.391 --> 01:54:47.053]  But the good news is our sites just get bigger and bigger because we do have a choice.
[01:54:47.113 --> 01:54:52.555]  And, you know, we don't blame Trump like certain people do for what happened over in Europe.
[01:54:52.575 --> 01:54:53.656]  Just truly bizarre.
[01:54:53.696 --> 01:54:54.996]  He's the one that actually warned of it.
[01:54:55.376 --> 01:55:03.139]  I want to find out from Tucker in closing what he thinks the end game is, how we counter this, whether he thinks we're going to make it out of this or not here in just a moment.
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:07.361]  Infowarsstore.com is one of the ways we fund this operation.
[01:55:07.641 --> 01:55:09.842]  Hillary for President t-shirts to promote the First Amendment.
[01:55:10.222 --> 01:55:12.963]  We have a big special running for the next four or five days.
[01:55:13.663 --> 01:55:15.904]  Liver Shield and Deep Cleanse.
[01:55:16.284 --> 01:55:17.244]  20% off when you get them together.
[01:55:17.264 --> 01:55:19.385]  15% off when you get them by themselves.
[01:55:20.205 --> 01:55:25.247]  Get them with the oxy powder and you can also get a 20% off on that as well.
[01:55:25.667 --> 01:55:27.168]  Go check out the cleanse for yourself.
[01:55:27.248 --> 01:55:27.448]  It's the
[01:55:27.748 --> 01:55:34.232]  It's the highest rated one out there on third-party sites to really get your liver to detox, your gallbladder, you name it.
[01:55:34.292 --> 01:55:34.873]  It's amazing.
[01:55:34.913 --> 01:55:36.294]  Watch the informational videos.
[01:55:36.734 --> 01:55:41.797]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[01:55:42.298 --> 01:55:47.521]  Also, sign up at infowars.com forward slash newsletter to get special news alerts and more.
[01:55:47.821 --> 01:55:48.822]  Back with Tucker Carlson.
[01:55:48.842 --> 01:55:49.983]  Again, I know you're a busy guy.
[01:55:50.003 --> 01:55:51.604]  A lot coming up.
[01:55:52.444 --> 01:55:54.866]  I see the endgame is trying to shut down free speech from the left.
[01:55:55.586 --> 01:56:00.530]  You're going to be covering RNC, DNC, obviously, for Fox News and The Daily Caller.
[01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:02.552]  But what else is in the endgame?
[01:56:03.733 --> 01:56:08.296]  Well, I mean, I do think that is a goal of many on the left.
[01:56:08.876 --> 01:56:18.784]  This idea that hate speech, whatever that is, hate speech is defined as something I don't agree with, is somehow not protected by the First Amendment, is taught as fact on college campuses.
[01:56:18.804 --> 01:56:21.686]  So you're seeing an entire generation of kids growing up
[01:56:22.205 --> 01:56:26.067]  Who believe that there are some things that you shouldn't be allowed to say and should be punished for saying.
[01:56:26.087 --> 01:56:30.709]  When of course that, you know, the whole idea of America is that you can say what you think is true.
[01:56:31.290 --> 01:56:31.830]  What is the endgame?
[01:56:31.870 --> 01:56:32.290]  I don't know.
[01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:34.571]  I mean, I'll tell you what I fear is tribalism.
[01:56:35.052 --> 01:56:38.213]  And that is the main problem in most countries in the rest of the world.
[01:56:38.714 --> 01:56:42.956]  People hate each other based on how they look or where they're from.
[01:56:43.664 --> 01:56:47.367]  And to have these societies that are not cohesive at all, where no one can relax.
[01:56:47.887 --> 01:56:50.570]  So dumbed down, dumbed down balkanization.
[01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:53.432]  And isn't that clearly the left's main mode of control?
[01:56:54.995 --> 01:56:59.017]  I mean, I don't know if that is intentional or not.
[01:56:59.077 --> 01:57:02.998]  I mean, I think most people, including most on the left, work by instinct.
[01:57:03.579 --> 01:57:07.580]  Clearly, they're driven by self-loathing and by the idea that America itself is illegitimate.
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:08.741]  So they're really not conscious.
[01:57:08.821 --> 01:57:11.402]  I mean, I agree with you, because when I talk to them, they're so stupid.
[01:57:11.442 --> 01:57:12.482]  I don't mean to be elitist.
[01:57:12.922 --> 01:57:14.343]  I never thought of myself as that smart.
[01:57:14.383 --> 01:57:16.924]  I thought, like, quiet trendies must be real smart.
[01:57:17.264 --> 01:57:19.285]  You talk to them, they're literally morons.
[01:57:19.943 --> 01:57:21.644]  Yeah, well, I think that's true.
[01:57:22.124 --> 01:57:26.567]  I mean, I think most people don't kind of think through the implications of what they believe.
[01:57:26.587 --> 01:57:29.049]  They kind of motor on day by day by instinct.
[01:57:29.369 --> 01:57:34.552]  But I do think you want to consciously try to prevent your society from becoming balkanized.
[01:57:34.592 --> 01:57:38.774]  The idea that you can have many cultures living harmoniously next to one another is false.
[01:57:38.834 --> 01:57:39.535]  It's never happened.
[01:57:39.875 --> 01:57:45.236]  You can have many races living next to each other, many religions, but you have to share a common culture, a common set of beliefs.
[01:57:45.556 --> 01:57:46.336]  You have to be engaged.
[01:57:46.356 --> 01:57:49.957]  You gotta buy into the country, you gotta buy into free market, you gotta buy into free speech.
[01:57:50.857 --> 01:57:55.458]  Exactly, or else you're divided and that just doesn't end well.
[01:57:55.538 --> 01:58:06.981]  And the one thing that bums me out about America, I love this country, but people don't have a global perspective, like they don't have a sense of what the histories of other countries are and what they've done wrong and what the consequences of that have been.
[01:58:07.381 --> 01:58:16.287]  And if you just pay a little bit of attention, you see that's the single biggest impediment to having a happy country is tribalism, balkanization, multiculturalism, whatever you want to call it.
[01:58:16.547 --> 01:58:20.570]  We all need to be united in a common set of beliefs.
[01:58:20.890 --> 01:58:21.331]  Exactly.
[01:58:21.351 --> 01:58:22.331]  They don't want a melting pot.
[01:58:22.351 --> 01:58:26.254]  They want us all to be in our own little group, and then they try to, like an orchestra, control us.
[01:58:26.294 --> 01:58:27.214]  That is not going to work.
[01:58:27.555 --> 01:58:28.075]  Never has.
[01:58:28.095 --> 01:58:29.176]  Total Tower of Babel.
[01:58:29.436 --> 01:58:30.817]  TheDailyCaller.com.
[01:58:30.857 --> 01:58:31.698]  Tucker, thank you for the time.
[01:58:31.718 --> 01:58:32.938]  I know you're a busy guy.
[01:58:32.978 --> 01:58:33.559]  Keep up the good work.
[01:58:34.110 --> 01:58:34.390]  Thanks, man.
[01:58:34.450 --> 01:58:34.910]  I appreciate it.
[01:58:35.251 --> 01:58:35.491]  You bet.
[01:58:35.511 --> 01:58:35.851]  Amazing.
[01:58:36.091 --> 01:58:36.871]  All right, we're gonna be back.
[01:58:37.011 --> 01:58:38.212]  Coming up, Tim Kennedy.
[01:58:38.952 --> 01:58:41.333]  I tell ya, doesn't get any more super soldier than that.
[01:58:41.873 --> 01:58:45.595]  In studio, straight ahead, and he's a patriot, a real American.
[01:58:45.635 --> 01:58:46.195]  Stay with us.
[01:58:46.835 --> 01:58:48.556]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:48.656 --> 01:58:50.657]  We're gonna be covering the latest on the attacks in Paris.
[01:58:50.697 --> 01:58:51.537]  Visit GCNlive.com.
[01:58:51.617 --> 01:58:52.958]  Which are Donald Trump's fault, of course.
[01:58:56.341 --> 01:59:03.706]  Uh, yeah, Alex, first of all, I want to say, Seeker 12, X2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet, I use them all.
[01:59:03.786 --> 01:59:04.726]  They're phenomenal.
[01:59:04.766 --> 01:59:05.267]  They work.
[01:59:05.527 --> 01:59:06.267]  Buy them, folks.
[01:59:06.347 --> 01:59:06.727]  Thank you, brother.
[01:59:06.747 --> 01:59:08.729]  I really thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:59:08.749 --> 01:59:14.692]  I am a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:59:15.213 --> 01:59:16.914]  Um... Welcome to the Info War.
[01:59:16.974 --> 01:59:22.377]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War at the same time.
[01:59:22.797 --> 01:59:23.518]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[01:59:23.538 --> 01:59:27.120]  I buy all the Nutraceuticals, Costco FX, uh, Nascent... Right!
[01:59:27.281 --> 01:59:28.181]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:59:28.221 --> 01:59:29.102]  Have they worked for you?
[01:59:29.262 --> 01:59:31.804]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:59:32.124 --> 01:59:33.185]  What products are you taking?
[01:59:33.205 --> 01:59:39.109]  Are you taking... Everything from, uh, Super Male to, uh, Brain Force to Winter Sun, uh, X2.
[01:59:39.490 --> 01:59:41.411]  Even got a little, uh, DNA Force.
[01:59:41.491 --> 01:59:45.014]  So, and I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofilth.
[01:59:45.114 --> 01:59:49.956]  Visit InfoWarsLives.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.

[01:59:52.138 --> 01:59:54.399]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:17.947 --> 02:00:22.528]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.189 --> 02:00:29.530]  I'm looking at DrugsReport.com, I'm looking at InfoWars.com.
[02:00:31.211 --> 02:00:35.632]  Hard to believe the media is blaming Donald Trump, saying it's his fault he made the Muslims mad.
[02:00:38.573 --> 02:00:39.853]  There's no end to these people.
[02:00:41.087 --> 02:00:43.569]  Explosions rock Brussels airport subway.
[02:00:43.589 --> 02:00:45.170]  34 dead, hundreds wounded.
[02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:48.351]  Suicide bomber attacks American Airlines check-in desk.
[02:00:49.672 --> 02:00:53.335]  Blast hits metro station just yards away from EU headquarters.
[02:00:53.975 --> 02:00:54.895]  Allah Akbar!
[02:00:55.696 --> 02:00:58.878]  But you heard him attack him and say how dare Trump says it's Muslims.
[02:00:58.898 --> 02:00:59.278]  Here it is.
[02:00:59.578 --> 02:01:02.420]  Trump already blaming Muslim immigration for terror attacks.
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:04.641]  It's like if a dam breaks.
[02:01:04.661 --> 02:01:07.003]  It's like he's already blaming water for the flood.
[02:01:08.427 --> 02:01:09.388]  I got a sunburn.
[02:01:09.408 --> 02:01:10.789]  He's already blaming the sun.
[02:01:12.730 --> 02:01:13.911]  I got bit by a mosquito.
[02:01:13.931 --> 02:01:15.052]  He's already blaming mosquitoes.
[02:01:16.433 --> 02:01:18.394]  More troops deployed to the streets, but not to the border.
[02:01:18.715 --> 02:01:19.475]  City shut down.
[02:01:19.535 --> 02:01:21.236]  Phone users urged to text, not call.
[02:01:21.256 --> 02:01:22.477]  There's a networks jam.
[02:01:22.557 --> 02:01:23.018]  Shocking.
[02:01:24.199 --> 02:01:24.919]  Unpreparedness.
[02:01:24.959 --> 02:01:25.560]  Terrorism.
[02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:27.281]  The terrorists remain at large.
[02:01:28.562 --> 02:01:30.143]  So much blood, like the apocalypse.
[02:01:30.864 --> 02:01:31.884]  ISIS celebrates.
[02:01:32.745 --> 02:01:34.826]  But Trump's wrong to say they celebrated, because they didn't.
[02:01:35.087 --> 02:01:35.927]  Muslims didn't do it, folks.
[02:01:35.947 --> 02:01:36.287]  You heard that.
[02:01:37.176 --> 02:01:38.717]  Whole of Europe has been hit.
[02:01:38.817 --> 02:01:41.218]  Hollande, who'll get more power out of the people he brought in.
[02:01:41.978 --> 02:01:43.899]  Delta, United, reroute flights.
[02:01:43.959 --> 02:01:45.959]  Belgium beefs up security at nuke plants.
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:48.720]  Royal Palms evacuated aftermath.
[02:01:49.061 --> 02:01:52.222]  Footage shows terrified travelers cowering behind suitcases.
[02:01:52.742 --> 02:01:55.763]  Europe vows to defend democracy on Black Day.
[02:01:56.363 --> 02:01:58.884]  American missionaries, military families among wounded.
[02:01:58.904 --> 02:02:01.345]  Yeah, they attacked the American line at American Airlines.
[02:02:01.645 --> 02:02:03.366]  So the headline is, Americans were targeted.
[02:02:04.906 --> 02:02:08.308]  They wanted to hit America, so they hit the American Airlines, the U.S.
[02:02:08.728 --> 02:02:10.509]  Attack narrowly missed two visiting U.S.
[02:02:10.549 --> 02:02:11.009]  Senators.
[02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:15.311]  Obama spends 51 seconds of Cuba's speech to address.
[02:02:15.711 --> 02:02:17.732]  Let's see which those two Senators were.
[02:02:17.812 --> 02:02:18.092]  Hmm.
[02:02:18.153 --> 02:02:20.934]  Because we know who runs ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[02:02:20.954 --> 02:02:22.755]  They're at Pennsylvania Avenue.
[02:02:22.775 --> 02:02:23.295]  I mean, he does.
[02:02:23.335 --> 02:02:24.896]  He ran them in Syria, ran them in Libya.
[02:02:26.249 --> 02:02:29.392]  Only days ago in Brussels, a Western leader celebrated an arrest of key terrorists.
[02:02:29.752 --> 02:02:34.457]  Belgium officials warned there were dozens of jihadists at large in the city and that more attacks were being planned.
[02:02:34.857 --> 02:02:36.679]  They couldn't have known how they were right.
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:39.682]  And then it goes ahead and breaks it all down.
[02:02:39.702 --> 02:02:41.944]  You guys read through that and see.
[02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:45.591]  Which, uh, senators were in there, so I don't have time to do that.
[02:02:45.711 --> 02:02:46.412]  We're about to go to break.
[02:02:46.932 --> 02:02:50.574]  Briefly, I plugged for like 30 seconds last hour, plugged once in the first hour.
[02:02:51.114 --> 02:02:52.996]  Most talk show hosts plug every segment.
[02:02:53.496 --> 02:02:54.276]  I skip breaks.
[02:02:54.917 --> 02:02:56.077]  I can't control myself.
[02:02:56.758 --> 02:03:02.081]  It is secondary to make money, though we need a lot of money to have reporters, crew, researchers, investigative journalists.
[02:03:03.223 --> 02:03:12.467]  We're going to defend this Republic, and we sell high quality shortwave radios, high quality non-GMO heirloom seeds at the lowest prices, wide selection, one of the widest out there.
[02:03:13.007 --> 02:03:22.832]  We sell high quality nutraceuticals, like Brain Force, and Survival Shield, Nacinine, NX2, and storable food, and we got big specials right now running until next week.
[02:03:24.052 --> 02:03:32.136]  10% off liver shield and deep cleanse that go together, 15% off when you buy them both together, 20% off when you get the ultimate cleanse with the oxy powder as well.
[02:03:32.836 --> 02:03:33.617]  We're good to go.
[02:03:56.761 --> 02:03:57.401]  Vitamin Shoppe.
[02:03:57.542 --> 02:04:02.905]  I mean, I could easily sell this for more and probably make more money because the psychology out there is something's really expensive.
[02:04:02.925 --> 02:04:03.565]  It must be great.
[02:04:04.006 --> 02:04:07.128]  These are amazing formulations with the top.
[02:04:08.143 --> 02:04:16.689]  Developers and designers in the world, three of the biggest companies that are the most well-known, doing this for us, and we just discount as much as we can.
[02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:17.710]  We've been very successful.
[02:04:18.150 --> 02:04:22.993]  But there's arguments around here whether I should charge a lot more, and I just, I want to treat you like I want to be treated.
[02:04:23.253 --> 02:04:25.015]  You're treating me like that as well, thank you.
[02:04:25.555 --> 02:04:27.796]  But I want to be able to send reporters to Europe right now.
[02:04:27.857 --> 02:04:29.017]  Quite frankly, it is in the budget.
[02:04:29.398 --> 02:04:30.999]  I want to go to Bilderberg in a month and a half.
[02:04:31.379 --> 02:04:32.980]  I want to cover all the Davos events.
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:35.882]  I want to really get the intel, and we're close to that.
[02:04:35.942 --> 02:04:36.803]  We've grown a lot.
[02:04:37.463 --> 02:04:38.183]  Buy the products.
[02:04:38.603 --> 02:04:39.524]  Shop with the good guys.

[02:04:58.531 --> 02:04:59.052]  Stay with us.
[02:05:06.582 --> 02:05:14.865]  A wave of bombings that killed at least 30 people in Brussels was carried out by ISIS militants, the group has claimed, reports The Independent.
[02:05:15.085 --> 02:05:22.889]  In a statement released through one of its propaganda outlets, the so-called Islamic State said explosive belts and devices were used.
[02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:26.410]  Islamic State fighters opened fire inside of an airport.
[02:05:26.570 --> 02:05:33.595]  Before several of them detonated their explosive belts, as a martyrdom bomber detonated his explosive belt in a metro station.
[02:05:33.855 --> 02:05:39.359]  A spokesperson said the attacks resulted in more than 230 dead and wounded.
[02:05:39.719 --> 02:05:46.564]  ISIS said Belgium was targeted as a country participating in the international coalition against the Islamic State.
[02:05:46.804 --> 02:05:54.610]  The timing of the attacks, coming days after the arrest of a Paris suspect, was considered significant, but no mention of the captured militant was made.
[02:05:54.970 --> 02:06:01.602]  As the death toll rose amid continuing rescue operations, ISIS supporters had been championing the attacks on Twitter.
[02:06:01.863 --> 02:06:04.648]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[02:06:07.464 --> 02:06:10.886]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:06:11.246 --> 02:06:18.369]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:06:18.970 --> 02:06:27.334]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:06:27.594 --> 02:06:34.197]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water,
[02:06:34.397 --> 02:06:41.462]  To the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:06:41.842 --> 02:06:45.064]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.

[02:08:26.793 --> 02:08:31.778]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:08:31.798 --> 02:08:33.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:36.604 --> 02:08:40.845]  Well, everybody knows that I celebrate humanity, and I love the empowerment of humanity.
[02:08:41.005 --> 02:08:58.491]  And America's not perfect, but I love our country, and I love our military, because they may get sent on some good missions, some bad missions, but when it comes to the opposite of some of the leftist, anti-American, communist slugs that we see out of these anti-Trump rallies and the rest of it, there's our military and then our special forces.
[02:08:58.531 --> 02:09:02.852]  And I can't get into, obviously, because I don't even want to know and don't get to know all the special units
[02:09:03.072 --> 02:09:03.572]  That's right.
[02:09:20.397 --> 02:09:23.678]  Uh, and it's, you know, pretty much a Chris Kyle level, uh, career, and then some.
[02:09:24.078 --> 02:09:25.539]  Uh, but these guys don't brag in the Army.
[02:09:25.579 --> 02:09:26.679]  It's okay, the Navy SEALs do.
[02:09:26.719 --> 02:09:27.719]  We love them as well.
[02:09:28.199 --> 02:09:29.980]  But, I tell you, Tim, so much happened.
[02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:32.401]  We had you shut up for the show a while back, a few days ago.
[02:09:32.961 --> 02:09:35.742]  And then, boom, this happens, uh, this morning.
[02:09:35.782 --> 02:09:36.602]  There is so much...
[02:09:37.142 --> 02:10:00.408]  to get into Tim Kennedy MMA dot com on Twitter Tim Kemeny MMA facebook.com forward slash Tim Kennedy and then of course you have your sheepdog response that is so integral and so key and then of course you're doing your middle heavyweight fighting there at the UFC so much going on and you're one of the co-host investigators on a great show hunting Hitler
[02:10:00.908 --> 02:10:04.430]  And then behind the scenes, you've got all this other military career going on.
[02:10:04.730 --> 02:10:06.432]  So a very, very busy guy.
[02:10:06.512 --> 02:10:12.976]  One reason I was asking you what areas you want to get into, because a lot of it, I know, you obviously can't talk about, but some we will.
[02:10:13.356 --> 02:10:14.477]  So great to have you here, my friend.
[02:10:15.217 --> 02:10:16.378]  Have you and Shane here today.
[02:10:17.178 --> 02:10:19.100]  Fellow Texans, where do you want to start?
[02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:20.881]  Obviously, probably the situation in Europe.
[02:10:21.421 --> 02:10:22.042]  Yeah.
[02:10:22.622 --> 02:10:25.444]  When we talked last time, ISIS had just come out and said that they're
[02:10:26.525 --> 02:10:27.246]  They wanted to kill me.
[02:10:27.446 --> 02:10:28.207]  They wanted to behead me.
[02:10:28.528 --> 02:10:30.811]  And the FBI came and said, hey, you're on the hit list.
[02:10:31.051 --> 02:10:33.955]  And when we talked then, I said, this isn't the beginning.
[02:10:35.076 --> 02:10:35.717]  This isn't the end.
[02:10:35.757 --> 02:10:36.438]  This is the beginning.
[02:10:36.779 --> 02:10:41.806]  From San Bernardino to Paris, Cologne, Germany, this is just the start of it.
[02:10:42.987 --> 02:10:45.148]  I think we even discussed specifically Belgium.
[02:10:45.809 --> 02:10:47.169]  And I said it's going to be coming to the UK.
[02:10:47.349 --> 02:10:48.410]  And we talked about it.
[02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.790]  We did.
[02:10:48.810 --> 02:10:53.592]  And here we are just like a few weeks later, a month later, and it's come to fruition.
[02:10:53.632 --> 02:10:54.293]  That's scary.
[02:10:55.033 --> 02:10:56.914]  It's nowhere near ending.
[02:10:57.174 --> 02:10:57.835]  It's just starting.
[02:10:58.035 --> 02:11:03.417]  This is the beginning of what I think is going to be a horrific change in Europe.
[02:11:04.238 --> 02:11:07.880]  And it's truly a horrific change of events.
[02:11:09.761 --> 02:11:10.941]  Let me ask you the question.
[02:11:11.001 --> 02:11:14.943]  Why do you think Merkel, Hollande would advertise to Turkey to bring these people in?
[02:11:15.043 --> 02:11:16.063]  Why are they bringing them here?
[02:11:16.423 --> 02:11:17.924]  Why are they not even checking their IDs?
[02:11:17.964 --> 02:11:18.744]  That's in the news.
[02:11:19.004 --> 02:11:22.925]  They won't tell governors like ours where they're going, what the numbers are.
[02:11:23.205 --> 02:11:24.105]  We've investigated.
[02:11:24.126 --> 02:11:25.486]  The report's coming out next week.
[02:11:26.126 --> 02:11:29.007]  It's 20 times what they're saying conservatively.
[02:11:29.367 --> 02:11:30.007]  What's going on?
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:44.784]  Conjecture can only go so far to say, we know what happens when the percentage increases of the Muslims in a respective area and the corresponding terrorist attacks that go along with it.
[02:11:46.425 --> 02:11:54.747]  The Paris attacker that just got arrested last week, we talked about these Muslim majorities that are saying, these are bad, horrific acts.
[02:11:55.208 --> 02:11:58.669]  But this guy has been living there in the open for the past month.
[02:11:59.289 --> 02:12:05.034]  And they know and they knew that this guy was there and they let him just live his life.
[02:12:05.794 --> 02:12:15.242]  So if we, if this is a testament, if this is an example of what can happen, so we know what happened in Paris and we know what they're capable of, and then he went back into a Muslim community and they just disappeared.
[02:12:15.322 --> 02:12:16.143]  He didn't have to hide.
[02:12:16.543 --> 02:12:21.708]  He could stay in the open and with no fear or consequence for what he did.
[02:12:21.848 --> 02:12:23.749]  No other group would support something like this.
[02:12:24.070 --> 02:12:24.230]  No!
[02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:27.692]  That is going to happen everywhere else.
[02:12:27.772 --> 02:12:28.693]  That's going to happen here.
[02:12:28.753 --> 02:12:29.833]  That's going to happen in the UK.
[02:12:29.913 --> 02:12:31.034]  It's going to happen again in France.
[02:12:31.094 --> 02:12:32.315]  It's going to happen again in Germany.
[02:12:32.655 --> 02:12:33.615]  This is just the beginning.
[02:12:34.496 --> 02:12:38.958]  Well, you predicted it when you were here a few months ago, specifically from your training, your background, all over the world.
[02:12:41.325 --> 02:12:41.545]  You know,
[02:13:04.111 --> 02:13:14.519]  I have no idea how the politicians can continue to escape this very clear statistic of there's X number of terrorists with this group of populace that you're bringing in.
[02:13:14.579 --> 02:13:19.002]  So if you have, let's just say conservatively, 10%, which is very conservative.
[02:13:19.022 --> 02:13:25.807]  They're saying the radicalized majority of the immigrants that are gonna be brought to the US, somewhere between 20 and 30% have been radicalized.
[02:13:25.847 --> 02:13:28.709]  That they are fanatics and that are looking for an opportunity to execute a mission.
[02:13:29.977 --> 02:13:30.898]  So, let's just say 10%.
[02:13:30.979 --> 02:13:32.461]  That's 1 in 10, right?
[02:13:32.822 --> 02:13:40.296]  So if you're going to bring somebody over to your house for dinner, 10 people, one of which could be a terrorist, you're still going to invite them over?
[02:13:41.414 --> 02:13:41.794]  No, you're not.
[02:13:41.814 --> 02:13:42.454]  That's insane, right?
[02:13:42.474 --> 02:13:48.857]  There's not a chance you'd bring any of them at 10% at 1%, but we know that it's somewhere between 10 and 20%.
[02:13:49.597 --> 02:13:53.878]  So the current establishment is letting these people in, and they're not vetting them.
[02:13:53.918 --> 02:13:55.259]  They're welcoming them with open arms.
[02:13:55.819 --> 02:13:58.120]  There has to be a bigger picture here of why they're doing it.
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:13:58.860]  I don't know what that is.
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:02.961]  I can only, in my worst nightmare, imagine what's going to happen if we continue to let them in.
[02:14:02.981 --> 02:14:06.643]  It's going to be more attacks that are just going to get more and more horrific.
[02:14:07.463 --> 02:14:14.209]  Well, Germany and France have declared civil emergencies, and they've taken libertarian and nationalist groups' rights.
[02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:18.533]  They've arrested Marie Le Pen, who is the nationalist frontrunner for president.
[02:14:18.934 --> 02:14:20.375]  She's not even as hardcore as Trump.
[02:14:20.515 --> 02:14:22.977]  She's more like Ronald Reagan.
[02:14:23.978 --> 02:14:25.940]  And they've arrested her twice now.
[02:14:25.980 --> 02:14:32.465]  They're talking about putting her in prison for saying, we're facing the greatest threat since Nazi Germany and France from radical Muslims.
[02:14:32.525 --> 02:14:35.888]  They have arrested her and say they may disqualify her from president.
[02:14:35.928 --> 02:14:40.091]  So to me, it's pretty clear the left is allied with these jihadis and protecting them.
[02:14:41.512 --> 02:14:42.353]  I don't understand why.
[02:14:43.214 --> 02:14:47.777]  You know, that's the big question for me to seek an answer for is why?
[02:14:47.937 --> 02:14:48.738]  Why are they protecting them?
[02:14:48.758 --> 02:14:50.639]  You know, the obvious
[02:14:51.573 --> 02:14:53.014]  Implications of political correctness.
[02:14:53.034 --> 02:14:55.975]  You know, it's been driven and pounded into us for now the past 10 years.
[02:14:56.456 --> 02:15:05.160]  No, you know, I realize that you live in San Bernardino and you think that the people living next door to you look suspicious and they're dressed in acting like radicals.
[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:08.282]  But no, you can't say anything because, you know, that would be racist.
[02:15:08.762 --> 02:15:10.223]  So don't say anything.
[02:15:10.243 --> 02:15:16.887]  Well, the FBI two years before was on them and got pulled off and almost charged for civil rights violation going after those very two.
[02:15:16.907 --> 02:15:19.228]  They should have got an award to be on the very two.
[02:15:19.548 --> 02:15:19.708]  Yeah.
[02:15:21.149 --> 02:15:28.915]  The opportunities to end this, we can't call it a religion anymore because when a religion then becomes a cult, the shift is clear.
[02:15:29.235 --> 02:15:34.219]  It's not an ideology of trying to peacefully appreciate some deity.
[02:15:34.279 --> 02:15:40.063]  This juncture is trying to change at a fundamental level, a way of life.
[02:15:40.644 --> 02:15:42.465]  And that's our way of life, the American way of life.
[02:15:42.665 --> 02:15:44.987]  And they are going at it every single way that they can.
[02:15:45.367 --> 02:15:47.789]  If there's a form of liberty, they want it to be destroyed.
[02:15:48.190 --> 02:15:49.651]  Whether it's suicide bomb or
[02:15:51.129 --> 02:15:52.090]  Ridiculous propaganda.
[02:15:52.110 --> 02:16:07.940]  They're trying to very efficiently destroy what we view as... Well sure, some would argue, oh well we went into their countries and did all this, but then they go and attack the non-radical countries and then all these liberal countries who aren't involved in all this, that's who they go attack.
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:11.782]  So it seems like the more you kiss their butt, the more they attack you.
[02:16:12.242 --> 02:16:13.323]  Yeah, the idea of
[02:16:14.884 --> 02:16:15.865]  I'm not defending any of that.
[02:16:39.344 --> 02:16:49.095]  I talked to Biggs who was over in Brussels right after the attacks, days after, and he said more people were angry at them for being, quote, Europeans or Westerners than he saw in Afghanistan or Iraq.
[02:16:49.676 --> 02:16:53.780]  And so he was questioning, they get more radicalized once they come into leftist countries.
[02:16:55.142 --> 02:16:56.524]  It's because it's a vacuum.
[02:16:56.564 --> 02:17:01.030]  It's an opportunity for their fanatic ideology to grow, to blossom.
[02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:04.014]  It's a fertile environment where they have limitless restrictions.
[02:17:04.074 --> 02:17:09.240]  So if you're in northern Iraq and you want to be part of ISIS,
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:12.041]  There's some pushback.
[02:17:12.081 --> 02:17:13.542]  The Kurds are going to try to kill you.
[02:17:15.583 --> 02:17:19.905]  Obviously, the American forces are there in a straight up looking for an opportunity.
[02:17:19.925 --> 02:17:21.726]  A lot of the non-radical Muslims aren't naive.
[02:17:21.746 --> 02:17:22.707]  They don't want the Wahhabis.
[02:17:22.747 --> 02:17:25.809]  Absolutely, because they know bombs start dropping, drones start flying.
[02:17:25.849 --> 02:17:28.130]  They don't want those guys near them.
[02:17:28.550 --> 02:17:29.711]  But then they come to Belgium.
[02:17:30.351 --> 02:17:31.352]  And there's no drones.
[02:17:31.532 --> 02:17:32.612]  There's no American forces.
[02:17:32.892 --> 02:17:34.233]  There's no, there's no Kurds.
[02:17:34.633 --> 02:17:40.656]  It's just a perfect, ripe, fertile environment for them to grow organically right there.
[02:17:41.537 --> 02:17:44.418]  Um, the, these fanatic crate, I mean, they're crazy.
[02:17:44.438 --> 02:17:44.859]  They're crazy.
[02:17:44.879 --> 02:17:45.919]  They tried to attack Benjamin.
[02:17:45.979 --> 02:17:47.340]  I currently run cars into them.
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:48.600]  They couldn't even get in businesses.
[02:17:49.001 --> 02:17:49.661]  It was like a movie.
[02:17:49.681 --> 02:17:50.481]  They were just get out of here.
[02:17:50.701 --> 02:17:53.503]  I was, I was there last year for USO tour in Belgium.
[02:17:53.903 --> 02:18:12.910]  And I was riding on a train and me and three other Americans were sitting there together and there was this girl that got onto the train and three Middle Eastern men kind of started maneuvering around this girl very aggressively and everybody started like shifting away to not look at what was going on.
[02:18:13.470 --> 02:18:15.351]  And me and my friends were like,
[02:18:15.991 --> 02:18:18.632]  Oh, hell no is this going to happen right in front of us.
[02:18:19.012 --> 02:18:21.133]  So we stood up and we went and sat next to the girl.
[02:18:21.493 --> 02:18:23.574]  She was shaking because she knew what was about to happen.
[02:18:23.674 --> 02:18:24.414]  She was going to be brought up.
[02:18:24.434 --> 02:18:26.575]  That's like it was Americans in France that stood up to the guy with the gun.
[02:18:26.615 --> 02:18:26.835]  Yes.
[02:18:26.975 --> 02:18:27.936]  They were all just going to lay down.
[02:18:28.116 --> 02:18:28.276]  Yeah.
[02:18:28.396 --> 02:18:36.719]  Everybody else on the train, with the train going into Paris, when the guy came out of the bathroom with a gun, with a linear target.
[02:18:36.779 --> 02:18:38.399]  That is a dream come true for terrorists.
[02:18:38.459 --> 02:18:40.020]  All he has to do is shoot down this train.
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:41.321]  Everything in front of him is going to die.
[02:18:41.641 --> 02:18:44.442]  A couple of Americans on the train says, no, we saw this in 9-11, not going to happen again.
[02:18:45.382 --> 02:18:51.666]  What I'm saying is, it is such an opportunistic place for them to walk into.
[02:18:51.686 --> 02:18:52.666]  There's no immune system.
[02:18:52.706 --> 02:18:53.687]  No, there's nothing there.
[02:18:53.707 --> 02:18:56.468]  There's no antibodies.
[02:18:56.849 --> 02:19:00.531]  If we're going to use that metaphor to fight back.
[02:19:00.671 --> 02:19:05.673]  Because if I was in a radical Muslim country, I don't want to get out of it and be free.
[02:19:05.693 --> 02:19:08.755]  I just don't know why they come to the West and they get even worse.
[02:19:10.456 --> 02:19:13.419]  Especially in, you know, Brussels, Belgium, UK, France.
[02:19:13.759 --> 02:19:15.361]  They would board a flight, they'd fly to Turkey.
[02:19:15.521 --> 02:19:18.964]  They'd fight for ISIS for, you know, a period of time.
[02:19:19.104 --> 02:19:22.007]  And then they now have battlefield experience.
[02:19:22.467 --> 02:19:27.892]  They have grown this deep-seated brother power.
[02:19:27.913 --> 02:19:29.054]  There's nothing like
[02:19:29.634 --> 02:19:31.795]  The bonds forged in war.
[02:19:32.155 --> 02:19:32.715]  They're empowered.
[02:19:32.895 --> 02:19:33.075]  Right.
[02:19:33.135 --> 02:19:37.077]  And then they come back to Belgium or to Brussels or to France or the UK.
[02:19:37.097 --> 02:19:40.078]  You know, they're now experienced war fighters.
[02:19:40.098 --> 02:19:41.379]  They're wolves around a bunch of sheep.
[02:19:41.659 --> 02:19:41.919]  Yeah.
[02:19:42.219 --> 02:19:43.820]  And now in comes the sheepdogs.
[02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:44.620]  Well, hopefully.
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:45.921]  You know, there has to be.
[02:19:46.601 --> 02:19:51.063]  So I run a company, Sheepdog Response, and that company trains people to
[02:19:52.223 --> 02:19:56.408]  And by the way, you're not even plugging it because it's totally filled, but you're trying to expand it.
[02:19:56.448 --> 02:19:56.949]  Stay there.
[02:19:57.309 --> 02:19:58.210]  Tim Kennedy's our guest.
[02:19:58.230 --> 02:20:02.235]  We're going to come back and talk to one of the top soldiers here in the United States.
[02:20:02.255 --> 02:20:05.058]  You don't want to say that, but they call him the most dangerous soldier in the United States.
[02:20:05.298 --> 02:20:05.879]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:05.899 --> 02:20:06.259]  Stay with us.
[02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:07.580]  We're good to go.

[02:22:05.504 --> 02:22:06.104]  Hey, everyone.
[02:22:06.244 --> 02:22:08.925]  In 20 plus years as a radio host, I've seen about everything.
[02:22:09.445 --> 02:22:13.387]  One thing that keeps recurring, though, are these timeshare charlatans.
[02:22:13.847 --> 02:22:25.671]  These high-pressure salespeople who get folks to come out to some resort for a special weekend offer, then they get them in a corner and browbeat them and coerce them into buying a timeshare they don't need, they don't want, and they can't afford.
[02:22:25.691 --> 02:22:27.652]  And then they're stuck with that thing forever.
[02:22:27.692 --> 02:22:31.233]  Monthly payments, mortgage payments, annual fees that keep going up and up.
[02:22:31.733 --> 02:22:34.796]  Well, up until recently, people thought they couldn't get rid of these things.
[02:22:34.816 --> 02:22:38.118]  You know, you can't get out of the contract, you can't get out of the deed or the membership.
[02:22:38.138 --> 02:22:38.999]  Well, that's not true.
[02:22:39.499 --> 02:22:45.083]  My friends at American Consumer Credit, a timeshare release company, can get you free.
[02:22:45.123 --> 02:22:47.205]  That's their personal guarantee.

[02:23:32.175 --> 02:23:34.555]  From the Robert Allen System, current returns not indicative of future results.
[02:23:35.171 --> 02:23:37.912]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[02:23:38.232 --> 02:23:40.832]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[02:23:40.872 --> 02:23:41.292]  Croix River.
[02:23:41.613 --> 02:23:43.613]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[02:23:43.833 --> 02:23:46.554]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[02:23:46.794 --> 02:23:47.314]  His excuse?
[02:23:47.674 --> 02:23:48.734]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:23:49.014 --> 02:23:50.295]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[02:23:50.615 --> 02:23:56.116]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[02:23:56.376 --> 02:23:57.116]  Don't wait.

[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:23.620]  All right, Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:24.281]  Jim Kennedy.
[02:24:25.455 --> 02:24:27.997]  Green Beret, American patriot, is our guest.
[02:24:28.738 --> 02:24:31.820]  Coming up in the next segment, he's got some comments about what happened with the Bundys.
[02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:34.762]  And he's been told, don't talk about this, but he's a real American.
[02:24:34.802 --> 02:24:35.583]  He's going to talk about it.
[02:24:35.843 --> 02:24:36.744]  I'm not pushing him to do it.
[02:24:36.764 --> 02:24:37.785]  In fact, I said, you don't have to.
[02:24:37.825 --> 02:24:39.526]  And he goes, no, I want to go ahead.
[02:24:39.586 --> 02:24:40.787]  So that's coming up.
[02:24:40.807 --> 02:24:41.848]  This is a really great guy.
[02:24:41.868 --> 02:24:46.852]  And I'm so glad that my old high school buddy, who I've been friends with since high school, Shane Steiner, trains with this guy.
[02:24:46.892 --> 02:24:49.094]  And that's how I got to know him, a fellow Texan.
[02:24:49.234 --> 02:24:50.335]  It's really amazing.
[02:24:50.355 --> 02:24:53.377]  You can follow him on Twitter, Tim Kennedy, MMA.
[02:24:54.378 --> 02:24:58.683]  Again, at Tim Kennedy MMA and of course there's just a lot of key information there.
[02:24:58.723 --> 02:25:01.806]  Okay, Tim, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:25:01.846 --> 02:25:03.828]  There's so much to get into.
[02:25:04.188 --> 02:25:14.679]  Let's talk about sheepdog response and how important it is, not just for Islamic terrorists, but criminals or whatever the case is, because clearly our economy worldwide is unraveling.
[02:25:14.959 --> 02:25:16.201]  Crime is starting to go up.
[02:25:17.101 --> 02:25:28.851]  I even want to make the time to try to go out and get back into firearms and get back into self-defense, because being a father, being a broadcaster, I used to be really good with guns and all the rest of it, quite frankly, only going out and shooting five or six times a year.
[02:25:28.912 --> 02:25:30.393]  I'm a shadow of my former self.
[02:25:31.013 --> 02:25:33.035]  I personally need to get involved as well.
[02:25:33.275 --> 02:25:34.676]  Tell us about Sheepdog Response.
[02:25:35.497 --> 02:25:37.679]  Yeah, the idea is pretty clear.
[02:25:38.900 --> 02:25:42.982]  So a sheepdog, you know, when you're surrounded by wolves and you're a sheep, you're just a prey.
[02:25:43.042 --> 02:25:44.723]  The predators are going to do whatever they want.
[02:25:45.123 --> 02:25:50.805]  The sheepdog is that one thing that has all the characteristics like a wolf, but can still kill.
[02:25:50.825 --> 02:25:52.926]  You know, it has the teeth, it has the canines.
[02:25:55.461 --> 02:26:05.825]  Maybe I'm selfish, maybe I love my family too much, but I'm no longer, and I don't think any American should, be able to hang back and just be like, you know, I'm going to let what happens around me happen.
[02:26:06.666 --> 02:26:11.148]  You're not going to be more metrosexual like these people getting beat up in the knockout game than getting fetal positions?
[02:26:11.488 --> 02:26:11.568]  No.
[02:26:12.368 --> 02:26:16.231]  I'm going to be the guy that recognizes the group of people that are coming across the streets.
[02:26:16.251 --> 02:26:21.494]  I'm going to use atmospherics and biometrics to say, hey, that group of guys do not look like they have good intent.
[02:26:21.514 --> 02:26:23.155]  So I'm going to move my family away from that.
[02:26:23.815 --> 02:26:28.018]  And then, or if I'm by myself and I see them looking for an opportunity, looking for that prey,
[02:26:28.578 --> 02:26:31.161]  You know, like, I know exactly what's coming.
[02:26:31.281 --> 02:26:37.567]  And I train people about how not to be in Brussels, in Belgium, in Paris, when these type of things are going to happen.
[02:26:38.388 --> 02:26:40.850]  And we give people the tools to survive.
[02:26:40.910 --> 02:26:43.994]  You know, you are going to be the hardest person that someone ever tries to kill.
[02:26:44.014 --> 02:26:44.634]  That is the point.
[02:26:44.954 --> 02:26:45.635]  That is the idea.
[02:26:46.656 --> 02:26:49.458]  Heaven forbid you are ever in a situation that somebody's going to try to kill you.
[02:26:49.778 --> 02:26:50.718]  It's not going to be easy.
[02:26:51.118 --> 02:26:52.759]  You will be hard to kill.
[02:26:52.859 --> 02:26:54.220]  And that is not something that just happens.
[02:26:54.580 --> 02:26:56.321]  It's not just a perspective.
[02:26:56.401 --> 02:26:57.082]  It's training.
[02:26:57.462 --> 02:26:58.162]  It's practice.
[02:26:58.202 --> 02:26:59.863]  It's something that you have to dedicate your life to.
[02:26:59.883 --> 02:27:03.805]  So that when they try to hurt you, when they try to hurt your family, it's a dead end.
[02:27:04.766 --> 02:27:05.446]  You're a hard target.
[02:27:05.666 --> 02:27:07.547]  And that's the opposite of what the statists want.
[02:27:07.587 --> 02:27:10.929]  They want us to be these jellyfish that don't know how to defend ourselves.
[02:27:10.969 --> 02:27:12.590]  We have to go to the system to protect us.
[02:27:13.581 --> 02:27:16.103]  Yeah, the system cannot protect us.
[02:27:16.163 --> 02:27:18.344]  The system cannot protect an individual.
[02:27:18.464 --> 02:27:25.929]  And when we talk about individual, the individual responsibility, this is an idea that goes back to the beginning of libertarianism, to being a constitutionalist, to the founding fathers.
[02:27:26.369 --> 02:27:28.271]  They said, you know, you're going to be responsible for your property.
[02:27:28.411 --> 02:27:29.832]  You're going to be responsible for your family.
[02:27:29.852 --> 02:27:34.595]  You're going to be responsible for your products, for your cattle, for your livestock, for your farm.
[02:27:35.575 --> 02:27:39.258]  And then for somehow in the past 50, 60 years, we've forgotten
[02:27:39.778 --> 02:27:46.002]  That that's what it kind of means to be an American, that you're going to be strong enough to be able to take care of yourself and take care of those around you and you're going to work hard.
[02:27:46.783 --> 02:27:47.763]  We have to get back there.
[02:27:47.864 --> 02:27:50.505]  We have to get back there or our way of life is at an end.
[02:27:51.646 --> 02:27:54.188]  And you know, knowing what you guys are into, it's amazing.
[02:27:54.248 --> 02:27:58.371]  I mean, you're into getting raw milk, you're into gardens, you're into that's all the really manly stuff.
[02:27:58.431 --> 02:28:00.552]  It's not just the fighting, not just training your family.
[02:28:00.572 --> 02:28:02.714]  It's 360 being self-sufficient.
[02:28:02.774 --> 02:28:03.494]  That's the answer.
[02:28:03.854 --> 02:28:05.596]  And is that not what is truly empowering?
[02:28:06.436 --> 02:28:06.656]  Yeah.
[02:28:07.757 --> 02:28:08.918]  Yeah, it's fun to shoot a gun.
[02:28:09.018 --> 02:28:10.559]  It's fun to get into the gym and work out.
[02:28:10.579 --> 02:28:13.501]  And it's fun to, you know, work on hand-to-hand combat and martial arts.
[02:28:14.142 --> 02:28:15.522]  But that's only a small piece of it.
[02:28:15.542 --> 02:28:21.106]  You know, like the community being part of a group of people that are like-minded, that will support you and fight for you.
[02:28:21.126 --> 02:28:27.131]  You know, if I picked up my phone, I could call a hundred people that would be at my doorstep to fight to the death with me.
[02:28:27.911 --> 02:28:28.852]  Within five minutes.
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:30.640]  You know what I mean?
[02:28:46.388 --> 02:28:48.510]  There's plenty of Americans that are like-minded like that.
[02:28:48.570 --> 02:28:49.371]  You can connect with them.
[02:28:49.671 --> 02:28:50.252]  They're out there.
[02:28:51.553 --> 02:28:56.018]  So being a libertarian is more than just... But those cowards always hit soft targets, so they don't want to come after you.
[02:28:56.078 --> 02:28:56.618]  No, they don't.
[02:28:57.239 --> 02:28:59.801]  They will look for the softest, easiest opportunity.
[02:29:00.102 --> 02:29:00.903]  They're not going to go after you.
[02:29:00.923 --> 02:29:01.823]  They're not going to go after me.
[02:29:02.124 --> 02:29:05.047]  They're going to say that they will so they can look tough in front of their friends.
[02:29:05.607 --> 02:29:06.708]  But, they're pussies.
[02:29:06.968 --> 02:29:07.449]  That's what they are.
[02:29:07.469 --> 02:29:08.890]  They love to chop little kids' heads off.
[02:29:08.910 --> 02:29:10.091]  They love, yeah, they do.
[02:29:10.151 --> 02:29:17.637]  They love women, they love children, they love unarmed journalists, they love people... See, that is so fundamentally dishonorable from the entire Western chivalry.
[02:29:17.978 --> 02:29:19.319]  Where did this filth come from?
[02:29:20.868 --> 02:29:24.631]  So for them, the measure of success is fear.
[02:29:25.231 --> 02:29:25.752]  That's what it is.
[02:29:26.032 --> 02:29:32.857]  So it doesn't matter if you go and fight another capable soldier and hurt him or fail.
[02:29:33.518 --> 02:29:34.378]  You achieve nothing.
[02:29:34.438 --> 02:29:36.900]  Let's say you kill him, you really invoke no fear.
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:41.203]  But if you go to the Brussels airport and you blow a bomb up and you hurt a whole lot of people.
[02:29:41.223 --> 02:29:42.965]  You blow up the Americans, the American Airlines line.
[02:29:43.445 --> 02:29:43.685]  Boom.
[02:29:43.846 --> 02:29:49.071]  You now have instilled fear in everyone around the world and you expect them to cower and then bow down.
[02:29:49.111 --> 02:29:51.394]  It just shows how their perspective is completely different.
[02:29:51.414 --> 02:29:51.814]  Stay there.
[02:29:51.834 --> 02:29:54.637]  I don't want to talk about that because this was an attack on the US, folks.
[02:29:54.657 --> 02:29:55.518]  We'll put an article out.
[02:29:55.558 --> 02:29:56.219]  We're on the march.
[02:29:56.259 --> 02:29:56.960]  They blew up the American Airlines.
[02:29:56.980 --> 02:29:57.280]  We'll be back.
[02:29:57.300 --> 02:29:58.542]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:59.463 --> 02:30:02.146]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:06.619 --> 02:30:14.928]  A wave of bombings that killed at least 30 people in Brussels was carried out by ISIS militants, the group has claimed, reports The Independent.
[02:30:15.149 --> 02:30:22.957]  In a statement released through one of its propaganda outlets, the so-called Islamic State said explosive belts and devices were used.
[02:30:23.257 --> 02:30:26.481]  Islamic State fighters opened fire inside of an airport.
[02:30:26.641 --> 02:30:33.646]  Before several of them detonated their explosive belts, as a martyrdom bomber detonated his explosive belt in a metro station.
[02:30:33.906 --> 02:30:39.410]  A spokesperson said, the attacks resulted in more than 230 dead and wounded.
[02:30:39.770 --> 02:30:46.615]  ISIS said Belgium was targeted as a country participating in the international coalition against the Islamic State.
[02:30:46.855 --> 02:30:54.681]  The timing of the attacks, coming days after the arrest of a Paris suspect, was considered significant, but no mention of the captured militant was made.
[02:30:55.021 --> 02:31:01.644]  As the death toll rose amid continuing rescue operations, ISIS supporters had been championing the attacks on Twitter.
[02:31:01.904 --> 02:31:05.766]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[02:31:06.106 --> 02:31:08.107]  Brain Force, it's completely different.
[02:31:08.187 --> 02:31:09.227]  Try a bottle of it.
[02:31:09.408 --> 02:31:10.868]  Rob Due joins us.
[02:31:11.008 --> 02:31:13.830]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:15.190]  Tell us what Brain Force did.
[02:31:15.210 --> 02:31:16.131]  I'd been working all day.
[02:31:16.171 --> 02:31:18.512]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:31:18.652 --> 02:31:19.652]  I get in here at 830.
[02:31:20.072 --> 02:31:21.713]  I was kind of run down.
[02:31:21.973 --> 02:31:23.754]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[02:31:23.914 --> 02:31:25.775]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:31:25.795 --> 02:31:28.397]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there and popped two of them.
[02:31:28.677 --> 02:31:30.819]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[02:31:30.959 --> 02:31:32.640]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:34.201]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:31:34.401 --> 02:31:35.422]  People really love it.
[02:31:35.742 --> 02:31:36.263]  Read about it.
[02:31:36.343 --> 02:31:40.085]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[02:31:40.185 --> 02:31:45.449]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:31:45.649 --> 02:31:49.511]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[02:31:49.672 --> 02:31:55.495]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[02:31:55.815 --> 02:32:01.739]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:05.848 --> 02:32:06.308]  Hey, everyone!
[02:32:06.669 --> 02:32:08.910]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:12.532]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:32:12.792 --> 02:32:14.393]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:32:14.874 --> 02:32:24.800]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:32:25.160 --> 02:32:31.124]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:32:31.604 --> 02:32:46.561]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[02:32:46.561 --> 02:32:46.961]  I think so.
[02:33:15.269 --> 02:33:17.832]  Another time in the Age of Wonder.
[02:33:33.619 --> 02:33:37.543]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:38.244 --> 02:33:44.271]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:47.546 --> 02:33:48.507]  Tim Kennedy's our guest.
[02:33:48.547 --> 02:33:49.748]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:33:50.189 --> 02:33:52.371]  Fourth Hour is coming up, hosted by Rob Dew.
[02:33:53.072 --> 02:33:57.316]  And again, Tim Kennedy's a fellow Texan Austinite right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:33:57.336 --> 02:34:02.721]  Really like him having him come in and give some of his military and geopolitical analysis.
[02:34:03.142 --> 02:34:06.705]  I want to open the phones up specifically for Tim Kennedy for quick
[02:34:07.546 --> 02:34:08.727]  Questions for Tim.
[02:34:08.747 --> 02:34:09.668]  800-259-9231.
[02:34:10.068 --> 02:34:13.651]  First time callers, by the way.
[02:34:13.671 --> 02:34:14.351]  800-259-9231.
[02:34:15.192 --> 02:34:23.419]  Sheepdogresponse.com is where you can find also some of the stuff that's his real passion, getting Americans and others trained.
[02:34:23.679 --> 02:34:25.680]  The only problem is these things are overflowed.
[02:34:25.700 --> 02:34:26.661]  You can't even get into them.
[02:34:26.961 --> 02:34:30.024]  And now he's trying to expand it and get other trainers that are up to his level.
[02:34:30.464 --> 02:34:34.006]  Because again, he literally, he's not bragging, put it up behind us on screen.
[02:34:34.346 --> 02:34:35.887]  We have a slideshow of it.
[02:34:36.167 --> 02:34:38.029]  You can see him in Army magazines and others.
[02:34:38.369 --> 02:34:43.432]  He rewrote the book on their close quarters combat for special forces.
[02:34:43.772 --> 02:34:45.093]  So that's how good he is.
[02:34:45.853 --> 02:34:47.974]  And it's just exciting to see something like that.
[02:34:48.615 --> 02:34:51.116]  True Americana and he's a patriot, of course.
[02:34:52.597 --> 02:34:53.758]  Now, before we go any further,
[02:34:55.071 --> 02:34:56.372]  I'm not Mr. In Shape.
[02:34:57.353 --> 02:35:03.678]  I got in shape, started getting into politics forever, didn't work out for 10 years other than like hikes and stuff, gained like 90 pounds.
[02:35:04.418 --> 02:35:23.433]  I've lost 70 pounds of that the last five years jogging, lifting weights and stuff, but when it really started to come off of me was when I came out with my own nutraceuticals with top advisors like Dr. Grip, the X2 nascent iodine that most people are deficient in, something that simple, liver cleanses, DNA force, super metal vitality that's just known quality,
[02:35:24.625 --> 02:35:26.588]  Condensed herbs to supercharge the body.
[02:35:26.788 --> 02:35:28.731]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:35:28.891 --> 02:35:31.094]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:35:31.475 --> 02:35:33.418]  And also, that's how you fund the operation.
[02:35:33.738 --> 02:35:37.704]  A Hillary for President t-shirt to promote the First Amendment.
[02:35:37.724 --> 02:35:39.086]  A bottle of super male vitality.
[02:35:39.106 --> 02:35:40.087]  A bottle of lung cleanse.
[02:35:41.388 --> 02:35:45.552]  A bottle of our high-quality oil of oregano that's just great for you.
[02:35:46.192 --> 02:35:54.239]  Knockout is just nine different compounds, like valerian root, melatonin, L-tryptophan, that healthily let you get deep sleep when you need it.
[02:35:54.259 --> 02:35:59.223]  I only take it like once or twice a week, but if I'm jazzed up at midnight, all hyped about politics, I can't go to sleep.
[02:35:59.723 --> 02:36:01.624]  Well, I'm not gonna just go drink a six-pack and go to bed now.
[02:36:01.705 --> 02:36:04.187]  I just pop one of these, 30 minutes, I'm ready to crash.
[02:36:04.907 --> 02:36:05.669]  Joint formula.
[02:36:05.790 --> 02:36:10.361]  All these are just known staples that should be really expensive at very competitive prices.
[02:36:10.922 --> 02:36:11.584]  Info Wars.
[02:36:13.044 --> 02:36:17.425]  Life.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:36:17.785 --> 02:36:26.287]  And we're getting more and more athletic advisors, more and more other folks to help us with new formulas, to just really bring you the very, very best.
[02:36:26.327 --> 02:36:27.727]  Try it out for yourself today.
[02:36:28.807 --> 02:36:40.430]  Now continuing, Tim Kennedy, we were talking during the break and I was asking you, honestly, with all your knowledge that you obviously can't get into as most of us classified, just the highest levels of things, let's just say that,
[02:36:44.028 --> 02:36:55.716]  Why do you think in Europe, in the U.S., all over the Western world, they're bringing in, there's lots of Muslim countries that aren't that radical like Jordan and others, they're bringing in the most radical from war-torn areas they know.
[02:36:56.057 --> 02:37:02.421]  They're flying planes in every day to Austin, D.C., New York, with hundreds of people on board, not checking IDs.
[02:37:02.761 --> 02:37:05.664]  They're giving them new fake names and social security numbers.
[02:37:05.704 --> 02:37:06.624]  That's in the news.
[02:37:07.365 --> 02:37:09.927]  But then you and I, they want to naked body scan us at the airport.
[02:37:11.076 --> 02:37:14.159]  What is that really about from your deep research, Tim Kennedy?
[02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:20.464]  I mean, not only just research, but the corrosion of liberty.
[02:37:20.484 --> 02:37:22.986]  It can't happen immediately.
[02:37:23.827 --> 02:37:30.492]  If we go back to the 1770s and you raise taxes on tea and we're going to throw crap into the bay.
[02:37:31.794 --> 02:37:35.196]  They recognized early on that that's not how you can go about it.
[02:37:35.216 --> 02:37:38.079]  You have to slowly erode the idea of liberty.
[02:37:39.580 --> 02:37:55.649]  Let's align, you know, let's take the left and let's align ourselves with an ideology that will continue to make huge, horrific, terrible events take place so that they can attack, slowly and methodically, our way of life.
[02:37:56.510 --> 02:38:05.855]  That they can erode our freedom, that they can take away our guns, that they can take away our freedom of speech, that they can, you know, get rid of search and seizure, that they can try to get a backdoor into every single one of our phones.
[02:38:06.256 --> 02:38:07.296]  This is, don't be, don't,
[02:38:09.957 --> 02:38:11.938]  Think for a second that all this is not by design.
[02:38:11.958 --> 02:38:15.259]  You know, they want to be in your phone, they want to read every- The FBI finally did it yesterday.
[02:38:15.299 --> 02:38:16.559]  We could get into the phone all along.
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:24.302]  And I'm not even against the FBI themselves, but these big multinationals, I mean, they're letting the Chinese government into the NSA now.
[02:38:24.362 --> 02:38:29.064]  You can't give these codes up because the government has been pretty much seized by foreign interests.
[02:38:29.304 --> 02:38:40.090]  What happened to a patriot, an American, a barrel-tested freedom fighter being that guy that would say, no, I believe in our way of life and I don't care what happens.
[02:38:40.170 --> 02:38:43.312]  I believe in a dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery.
[02:38:43.432 --> 02:38:44.432]  What happened to that idea?
[02:38:44.913 --> 02:38:46.574]  Now we're willing to give away everything.
[02:38:46.594 --> 02:38:48.475]  We're willing to give away
[02:38:49.775 --> 02:38:52.077]  Access to our phones, to our emails, to our homes.
[02:38:54.019 --> 02:38:56.701]  Even our right to peacefully assemble or to speak.
[02:38:56.721 --> 02:39:06.609]  But when the jihadi leader in San Bernardino for years was on Facebook saying, I'm going to carry out jihad, went to terror training camps, the FBI knew, legally had the intel, weren't allowed to bust her.
[02:39:07.030 --> 02:39:08.210]  They want, because they want it to happen.
[02:39:09.168 --> 02:39:23.060]  They can't take away our freedoms, they can't take away our liberties, unless they have examples to specifically reference that say, look, man, if we were able to get into those guys' phones and San Bernardino, just like yours and mine, then we could have prevented this.
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:29.846]  And then we have 350 million Americans that are like, oh my goodness, what sane person wouldn't want to be able to stop that?
[02:39:30.046 --> 02:39:34.209]  You know, so letting it happen is a type of false flag, and it's a fact.
[02:39:34.249 --> 02:39:36.831]  The local FBI tried to do their job within the law.
[02:39:36.871 --> 02:39:37.732]  They could have stopped it.
[02:39:38.032 --> 02:39:43.136]  They're ordered by the Justice Department and threatened with a trial for civil rights violations.
[02:39:43.457 --> 02:39:45.898]  The people they targeted are absolutely terrorists.
[02:39:46.299 --> 02:39:47.199]  They don't get awards.
[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:48.020]  They get in trouble.
[02:39:48.460 --> 02:39:52.404]  And then the political people of the Justice Department say, give us all your freedom.
[02:39:53.024 --> 02:39:55.145]  When they, bottom line, protected the terrorists.
[02:40:15.524 --> 02:40:21.607]  Creating opportunities for these things to happen, or they're just opportunistically saying, I'm going to take advantage of this.
[02:40:21.627 --> 02:40:24.188]  Well, some of the corrupt elements on top are undoubtedly there.
[02:40:24.248 --> 02:40:25.168]  And so here's my question.
[02:40:25.709 --> 02:40:28.870]  Everybody I've talked to who's been in combat is more awake to the public.
[02:40:29.110 --> 02:40:32.892]  But I've talked to special forces people across the board, they're the most awake people I've talked to.
[02:40:33.252 --> 02:40:34.893]  I've talked to a lot of cops, they're awake as well.
[02:40:35.153 --> 02:40:41.096]  But then I see the power structure doing bad stuff, but then the very members of the structure that do the enforcement
[02:40:41.676 --> 02:40:42.937]  Are some of the best people I know.
[02:40:43.237 --> 02:40:44.617]  Have you found that paradox?
[02:40:44.677 --> 02:40:46.418]  Have you found that number, that statistic?
[02:40:46.658 --> 02:40:47.739]  And what does that represent?
[02:40:47.779 --> 02:40:51.941]  Because, give true from what I've seen, that's got to freak out some of the bad guys.
[02:40:51.961 --> 02:40:52.941]  They're not all bad at the top.
[02:40:53.222 --> 02:40:56.363]  It's got to freak them out knowing that their own foot soldiers are awake.
[02:40:58.664 --> 02:40:59.665]  They have to be scared to death.
[02:41:00.185 --> 02:41:06.668]  When you look at the mean, the body of the American special operations community, they're guys like me.
[02:41:07.088 --> 02:41:07.829]  You know, they are
[02:41:08.945 --> 02:41:09.466]  I don't know.
[02:41:28.484 --> 02:41:31.786]  You have very, very intelligent people that are finally seeing the big picture.
[02:41:31.806 --> 02:41:37.931]  It's like we've peeked behind and seen the guy that's pulling all the strings and we're done with it.
[02:41:38.271 --> 02:41:41.774]  We understand and now we're taking action to hopefully affect change.
[02:41:41.794 --> 02:41:43.115]  And that's what you're doing here today.
[02:41:43.795 --> 02:41:45.918]  You have a lot of courage to be here, buddy.
[02:41:45.958 --> 02:41:46.478]  To a degree.
[02:41:46.499 --> 02:41:50.443]  But you'll have no country if we don't stand up.
[02:41:50.844 --> 02:41:52.286]  I love this way of life.
[02:41:52.506 --> 02:41:53.808]  I've fought for it.
[02:41:54.168 --> 02:41:54.729]  I believe in it.
[02:41:55.149 --> 02:41:55.710]  It's yours!
[02:41:56.071 --> 02:41:57.793]  And I'm going to continue to fight for it.
[02:41:58.093 --> 02:41:59.875]  Maybe I have to do it a different way.
[02:41:59.935 --> 02:42:00.957]  Not from behind a gun anymore.
[02:42:02.318 --> 02:42:06.719]  Well, you're doing a great job across the board, and folks really respect you and appreciate you.
[02:42:06.999 --> 02:42:08.600]  You know, I get misrepresented all the time.
[02:42:08.660 --> 02:42:09.440]  It's like Jade Helm.
[02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:11.720]  I never said Jade Helm was a takeover.
[02:42:11.761 --> 02:42:12.801]  They were coming to take our guns.
[02:42:12.821 --> 02:42:13.721]  The military would never do that.
[02:42:14.301 --> 02:42:20.583]  I said it's more conditioning to make it about domestic operations, like you just said earlier, instead of fighting real threats.
[02:42:21.343 --> 02:42:23.205]  And then I've since talked to other folks at Special Ops.
[02:42:23.225 --> 02:42:25.306]  They say, no, Alex, you know, we know you said that.
[02:42:25.366 --> 02:42:26.788]  We know they misrepresented.
[02:42:27.208 --> 02:42:28.589]  And then I see them doing that.
[02:42:28.789 --> 02:42:33.913]  And then they go on the news and thousands of publications and say that I said they were coming to Texas to take the guns.
[02:42:34.494 --> 02:42:35.775]  What's your real view on Jade Helm?
[02:42:38.365 --> 02:42:45.946]  It's a fantastic training opportunity for guys like me and guys in my field to come to the best areas in the world to train.
[02:42:46.047 --> 02:42:50.687]  You know, like Texas, actually just the South Central, Southwest, Southeast.
[02:42:51.268 --> 02:43:00.329]  Those are, this is a great area, you know, like with the Everglades and Louisiana, the Mississippi River, you know, to do amphibious assaults, to be able to jump into ranches.
[02:43:00.589 --> 02:43:03.510]  There's no place like, you know, even Texas that has such
[02:43:04.585 --> 02:43:05.066]  I don't know.
[02:43:17.338 --> 02:43:22.720]  The American populace to get used to seeing military activity in their area.
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:23.801]  So that's scary.
[02:43:24.561 --> 02:43:36.847]  I don't like that idea of, hey, let's get the American people used to seeing Humvees and Polaris Razors and guys jumping out of C-130s or Blackhawks haloing into some ranches in Texas.
[02:43:36.907 --> 02:43:38.068]  That's a scary thought.
[02:43:38.448 --> 02:43:38.568]  Yes.
[02:43:53.616 --> 02:43:58.680]  Sure, and the media spends it that I hate the military when it's the opposite.
[02:43:58.780 --> 02:44:01.503]  All I'm saying is they're trying to get rid of posse comitatus.
[02:44:01.583 --> 02:44:02.724]  Generals have warned of it.
[02:44:03.985 --> 02:44:06.667]  And so I'm glad that you and others have made that point.
[02:44:07.487 --> 02:44:10.030]  Separately, I want to get into the Bundy ranch situation in a moment.
[02:44:10.050 --> 02:44:11.251]  Also talked about UFC.
[02:44:11.951 --> 02:44:14.733]  You've been tested, you're clean, but you just got recently tested.
[02:44:14.753 --> 02:44:15.774]  You haven't talked about that yet.
[02:44:15.794 --> 02:44:17.376]  So I want you to expand on that.
[02:44:17.416 --> 02:44:19.717]  But separately, we see
[02:44:21.078 --> 02:44:35.958]  These moves to use the military domestically, and my issue is they're not even saying we're going to use it against terrorists or jihadists, but it's for veterans, gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, and the Tea Party, and then a, quote, coming war with the Tea Party is coming.
[02:44:36.018 --> 02:44:37.240]  I know that's in the Army training.
[02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:38.622]  It's even been in the Army Times.
[02:44:38.942 --> 02:44:40.863]  I know that's one of the things that's woken the military up.
[02:44:41.123 --> 02:44:50.608]  They've told me when they call people in and say, quote, like Fort Hood two years ago, said Fox News, the founding fathers wouldn't be welcome in today's military, including George Washington.
[02:44:50.868 --> 02:44:52.449]  Well, George Washington founded the U.S.
[02:44:52.529 --> 02:44:52.729]  Army.
[02:44:53.009 --> 02:44:55.090]  That's got to tell you there's some bad people at the top.
[02:44:59.242 --> 02:44:59.642]  They wouldn't.
[02:45:00.303 --> 02:45:05.286]  What the founding fathers were would be considered to be domestic terrorists.
[02:45:06.227 --> 02:45:07.808]  And how frightening is that?
[02:45:08.208 --> 02:45:14.633]  Where what I consider to be a true patriot, a true American, somebody that believes in liberty and freedom.
[02:45:15.993 --> 02:45:18.055]  That is an ideology.
[02:45:20.216 --> 02:45:25.660]  Approach to freedom that we don't want in our military.
[02:45:26.221 --> 02:45:26.781]  That's scary.
[02:45:27.441 --> 02:45:37.909]  What did the leftists think of the last six, seven years when they began, because that's been in the news, trying to train the military that George Washington, the founders are bad, men are bad, the family's bad, private property's bad.
[02:45:38.209 --> 02:45:40.911]  I mean, if I was trying to turn them against the establishment, I would do that.
[02:45:40.971 --> 02:45:46.915]  Is that how disconnected the left is, that they would call in officers and special ops and brainwash them?
[02:45:48.576 --> 02:45:49.477]  It isn't working.
[02:45:49.737 --> 02:45:51.939]  North Koreans had trouble brainwashing our troops.
[02:45:52.259 --> 02:45:54.101]  Certainly, a bunch of leftists can't.
[02:45:56.583 --> 02:45:57.443]  No, they can't.
[02:45:57.904 --> 02:46:00.025]  But indoctrination, there's nothing you can do about it.
[02:46:04.622 --> 02:46:15.765]  Put a subject under constant scrutiny, and even their job performance will be limited in the success that they can see in their career by where they align themselves politically.
[02:46:15.785 --> 02:46:18.125]  You have no choice.
[02:46:18.165 --> 02:46:26.848]  If you want to be successful at your job, to then, in some ways or another, cower to what they're trying to project into the military.
[02:46:28.404 --> 02:46:33.068]  It's unfortunate, but if you want to be successful in the military, to some degree, you have to align yourself with this.
[02:46:33.168 --> 02:46:54.185]  Sure, but the good news is, correct me if I'm wrong, and you already said this earlier, almost all the special ops people I run into, talk to, talk to others, I've talked to like Colonel Schaefer, around the Antibes, been live in units, countless others on record have said, hey, don't worry, almost all the informed people in the military know exactly what's going on, Alex, and, you know, we've got your six, is basically what I've been told.
[02:46:55.714 --> 02:47:03.940]  It would be a huge catastrophic failure of an idea to say, we're going to take special operations and we're going to have them go.
[02:47:04.972 --> 02:47:06.554]  Get guns from Americans.
[02:47:27.577 --> 02:47:27.997]  No, bro.
[02:47:28.277 --> 02:47:28.877]  Not gonna happen.
[02:47:28.917 --> 02:47:32.579]  Well, it turns out a lot of them did say no in Katrina, and the media lied and said they went for it.
[02:47:32.999 --> 02:47:33.619]  Yeah, it didn't happen.
[02:47:33.959 --> 02:47:34.519]  Another PSYOP.
[02:47:34.539 --> 02:47:36.900]  They showed a few units doing it, it was all bull.
[02:47:37.220 --> 02:47:39.101]  Yeah, it's insane.
[02:47:39.121 --> 02:47:43.962]  You're not gonna find guys that believe in freedom more than the special operations community.
[02:47:44.322 --> 02:47:46.963]  They bleed it, they fight for it, they love it, they live it.
[02:47:48.363 --> 02:47:56.586]  People all the time are attacking me, they're saying, you're just a pawn for the big federal movement trying to manipulate this or that.
[02:47:56.986 --> 02:47:57.446]  Do it bro.
[02:47:57.466 --> 02:48:04.210]  You know, thank God that so many patriots are aware of what's happening and that's a real ace in the hole.
[02:48:04.491 --> 02:48:16.118]  And I gotta say it, there's a lot of bad stuff with the police but on average they're more awake than the public and that's why George Soros wants to fund this attack the local police, shoot a cop pumping gas to further destabilize the country and it's just not working.
[02:48:18.403 --> 02:48:18.983]  I believe blue.
[02:48:19.603 --> 02:48:20.584]  My dad was a police officer.
[02:48:20.604 --> 02:48:22.524]  I went to the police academy in 1999.
[02:48:22.604 --> 02:48:25.785]  My brother's a police officer.
[02:48:25.805 --> 02:48:28.546]  These are guys that put their lives on the line every single day.
[02:48:28.886 --> 02:48:29.606]  Nobody's perfect.
[02:48:29.946 --> 02:48:30.927]  They have a tough job.
[02:48:31.107 --> 02:48:41.189]  If you're gonna attack the police force, go try to do a ride along for a day where every single car that you walk up to and every interaction that you have could potentially be somebody that's gonna try to kill you.
[02:48:41.710 --> 02:48:42.790]  It is a taxing
[02:48:43.510 --> 02:48:51.412]  It's a soul-wrenching occupation, and these guys do it every single day with the sole purpose of trying to protect Americans.
[02:48:51.432 --> 02:48:55.453]  Yeah, there's dudes that aren't perfect and make mistakes.
[02:48:55.713 --> 02:49:00.395]  My issue is if you don't like some of the stuff they're doing, that's policy, that's the legislature, that's the city.
[02:49:00.675 --> 02:49:05.256]  Look in the mirror, stop the government on top turning the police into Gestapo.
[02:49:05.836 --> 02:49:10.297]  The guys themselves, they're doing what their job is requiring them to do.
[02:49:10.417 --> 02:49:11.778]  You know, if you want to, here in Austin,
[02:49:13.418 --> 02:49:18.341]  Our police chief, I disagree with him all the time and like the vast majority of times.
[02:49:18.421 --> 02:49:28.087]  So I try to affect change in that way, where I specifically go to that municipal department and I try to express and let my voice be heard so that I can affect policy change.
[02:49:28.607 --> 02:49:32.910]  If you're just standing back and then throwing stones at the police officers, one, you're not affecting change.
[02:49:32.930 --> 02:49:34.611]  You're doing no... You're going to turn them against your idea.
[02:49:35.714 --> 02:49:36.335]  It's the opposite.
[02:49:36.355 --> 02:49:36.875]  It's idiotic.
[02:49:37.496 --> 02:49:38.276]  I want to go to some calls.
[02:49:38.296 --> 02:49:40.158]  I'm going to skip this network break because it's so powerful.
[02:49:40.178 --> 02:49:42.019]  Tim Kennedy is here with us right now.
[02:49:42.640 --> 02:49:46.703]  But since we got into this, I don't know how much you can go into this, but I'm going to just say it right now.
[02:49:46.763 --> 02:49:50.367]  Joe Biggs went out with David Knight a few months ago to cover the Bundy situation.
[02:49:51.027 --> 02:50:01.773]  And he got calls from people in special ops that he knew, from Iraq and Afghanistan, saying, we've been called, you need to get out of there, or you and Knight may be arrested, we're gonna see everybody out there is bad.
[02:50:02.193 --> 02:50:05.696]  And Knight said, he got a bunch of calls by the way, he said, what do you mean?
[02:50:05.816 --> 02:50:08.437]  I'm here covering this, I don't even agree with how they're handling this.
[02:50:08.897 --> 02:50:09.978]  And they said, you better get out of there.
[02:50:10.018 --> 02:50:11.319]  Well, he didn't get out of there.
[02:50:11.719 --> 02:50:17.883]  And so I thought that was pretty aggressive and intimidating to the real press, when they know we weren't like some of the fake press out there.
[02:50:18.803 --> 02:50:19.684]  That was a concern.
[02:50:20.064 --> 02:50:21.565]  And then I learned from Shane about this.
[02:50:21.605 --> 02:50:22.206]  I asked him about it.
[02:50:22.226 --> 02:50:22.967]  I said, you don't have to get into it.
[02:50:22.987 --> 02:50:25.349]  He said, no, I want to get into it about what happened.
[02:50:25.369 --> 02:50:28.932]  But we see the footage we're going to play in a minute of LaVoy Finnegan and others in that truck.
[02:50:29.332 --> 02:50:31.354]  They're shooting through the car, whoever it is.
[02:50:31.754 --> 02:50:37.539]  We've now learned it's now in the news in the Oregonian bullet hole on LaVoy Finnegan's truck traced to elite
[02:50:38.516 --> 02:50:44.740]  The FBI team, bullet casings, they're saying there's seven shots, not four, from a LaVoy Finnecombe shooting scene.
[02:50:45.581 --> 02:50:49.603]  Finnecombe shooting was Bundy driver, bodyguard, and FBI agent provocateur.
[02:50:49.663 --> 02:50:50.504]  That's the New American.
[02:50:50.544 --> 02:50:52.485]  So, this thing's unraveling.
[02:50:53.646 --> 02:50:57.429]  And so, Tim Kennedy, you want to tell folks your experience with this?
[02:50:58.409 --> 02:51:01.952]  You know, what happened to that?
[02:51:03.243 --> 02:51:04.104]  Those are farmers.
[02:51:04.384 --> 02:51:05.084]  Those are ranchers.
[02:51:05.645 --> 02:51:10.688]  If that was a few thousand, not even a few, if that was a thousand miles south, that'd be my family.
[02:51:12.350 --> 02:51:13.350]  They're farmers in California.
[02:51:13.410 --> 02:51:14.351]  Yeah.
[02:51:14.551 --> 02:51:16.873]  And they're no different than the Bundys.
[02:51:18.354 --> 02:51:23.679]  No, hey, they're not as vocal, obviously, but you just moved geographically, a thousand miles.
[02:51:24.079 --> 02:51:29.404]  Now you're on Kennedy land, attacking people, saying that you can't be doing this.
[02:51:30.324 --> 02:51:32.907]  The tactics that were used there, I've done that in Africa.
[02:51:33.087 --> 02:51:34.628]  I've done that in the Middle East.
[02:51:34.748 --> 02:51:35.869]  I've done that in South America.
[02:51:37.611 --> 02:51:41.234]  Nor would I ever do it in Oregon or anywhere in the United States.
[02:51:41.274 --> 02:51:41.794]  And that's what hurt me.
[02:51:46.345 --> 02:51:47.125]  Those are farmers.
[02:51:47.285 --> 02:51:55.427]  When we have guys walking into a business in San Bernardino and mowing people down, that's terrorism.
[02:51:56.027 --> 02:52:01.328]  You know, some farmers that are saying, hey, get off our ranch, this is how we want to do our ranch, that's not terrorism.
[02:52:02.168 --> 02:52:06.028]  Sure, they'll argue, well, it was federal, but the feds keep raising the rates where you can't be on it.
[02:52:06.048 --> 02:52:10.409]  I mean, they're running everyone out, they're stealing mines, they're bragging about it on video.
[02:52:10.769 --> 02:52:13.410]  But the bigger issue is some of the special ops people.
[02:52:13.430 --> 02:52:15.150]  I mean, can you get into that in the phone call you got?
[02:52:15.410 --> 02:52:17.531]  No, I can't get into that.
[02:52:18.491 --> 02:52:26.235]  Ultimately, I think it's a larger issue that people are getting calls like Biggs and others to be told to shut up.
[02:52:26.255 --> 02:52:27.555]  For me, that's the issue.
[02:52:27.755 --> 02:52:31.237]  You can argue about what really happened there, but what are they doing calling people about their First Amendment?
[02:52:31.437 --> 02:52:34.618]  Is that bad now, too?
[02:52:34.638 --> 02:52:37.339]  The community I come from is very small.
[02:52:37.539 --> 02:52:38.560]  Everybody knows everybody.
[02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:43.482]  When you're in an elite unit, I know all the guys in every single elite unit.
[02:52:44.102 --> 02:52:44.763]  In the United States.
[02:53:05.257 --> 02:53:09.159]  They, you know, they're hurt, where I'm not supporting them, or they think I'm not supporting them.
[02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:11.801]  I support the American white life.
[02:53:11.961 --> 02:53:15.483]  You know, there's nothing, you're not going to put a muzzle on me and say I can't say it.
[02:53:15.503 --> 02:53:16.144]  That comes first.
[02:53:16.564 --> 02:53:17.144]  Absolutely.
[02:53:17.424 --> 02:53:19.165]  And in my honesty, in my conviction.
[02:53:19.786 --> 02:53:20.666]  Well, when did you get upset?
[02:53:20.686 --> 02:53:27.270]  Because I heard it was when you saw the footage, we'll actually play some of the audio right now, where they're driving in the truck and bullets are shooting through it, they're not shooting back.
[02:53:27.310 --> 02:53:28.411]  I mean, that's wrong.
[02:53:28.931 --> 02:53:31.692]  Yeah, shoot no shoot for me is pretty clear.
[02:53:31.712 --> 02:53:41.857]  You know, the tactics of setting up a roadblock with a linear ambush, guys in the tree line, those are things that I will do in Afghanistan or Iraq.
[02:53:41.877 --> 02:53:47.039]  Those are things that I don't want to see happen in the United States, especially to farmers, you know, to ranchers.
[02:53:47.459 --> 02:53:53.642]  Listen, I say if some farmer pulls a gun and starts shooting at you, shoot him, but just shooting up a car as it drives down the road, that sounds ridiculous.
[02:53:56.161 --> 02:53:56.601]  Are you hit?
[02:53:57.062 --> 02:53:59.023]  Well, I think you're in the right to say that's wrong.
[02:53:59.063 --> 02:54:00.744]  We're not attacking people that are involved in that.
[02:54:00.764 --> 02:54:02.646]  We're saying, what are the feds trying to get you to do?
[02:54:03.985 --> 02:54:04.806]  I don't know, Ian.
[02:54:04.826 --> 02:54:06.728]  This is, uh... It's scary.
[02:54:07.008 --> 02:54:10.311]  You know, it's just... You watch this, and you're like, is this in Syria?
[02:54:10.351 --> 02:54:10.892]  Where is this?
[02:54:10.912 --> 02:54:11.993]  Where is this wood line?
[02:54:12.073 --> 02:54:14.835]  Is this happening, you know, in northern Afghanistan, in the mountains?
[02:54:15.196 --> 02:54:21.902]  Yeah, well, if you've got a Predator drone, you see guys loading explosives on the side of the road, and they get in a Jeep and drive off, then you shoot the Jeep, because you saw them loading bombs.
[02:54:22.322 --> 02:54:23.884]  But these people weren't loading bombs.
[02:54:24.124 --> 02:54:25.686]  Or were they driving to church or something?
[02:54:25.706 --> 02:54:26.747]  Yeah, they were driving to a meeting.
[02:54:28.305 --> 02:54:29.905]  Yeah, I see Ronald skipping off that car.
[02:54:33.366 --> 02:54:34.206]  God save America.
[02:54:36.327 --> 02:54:38.627]  We got a long way to go to get back to where we should be.
[02:54:39.348 --> 02:54:42.468]  Well, that's the influence of the leftists that were in that FBI unit.
[02:54:42.548 --> 02:54:43.369]  I know all about it.
[02:54:44.029 --> 02:54:47.470]  They threaten people in this operation and others for simply trying to cover it.
[02:54:48.770 --> 02:54:50.130]  That is the cherry on top.
[02:54:50.190 --> 02:54:52.611]  They would call people up and say, you better shut your mouth.
[02:54:53.536 --> 02:54:54.116]  And it's wrong.
[02:54:54.696 --> 02:54:55.597]  We're not going to shut our mouths.
[02:54:55.717 --> 02:54:56.157]  End of story, okay?
[02:54:56.197 --> 02:54:59.337]  We're not going to shut our mouths about the jihadis you're bringing in, any of it.
[02:54:59.858 --> 02:55:00.798]  That's not America.
[02:55:00.838 --> 02:55:01.518]  That's not what we're doing.
[02:55:01.838 --> 02:55:03.858]  Tim Kennedy, we've got your websites up.
[02:55:03.878 --> 02:55:05.719]  We'll put them up on InfoWars.com.
[02:55:06.219 --> 02:55:07.779]  Everybody should visit them.
[02:55:08.099 --> 02:55:10.600]  CheapDogResponse.com, TimKennedyMMA.com.
[02:55:10.620 --> 02:55:14.001]  We're going to take you five minutes to the next hour because I want to go to six or seven calls.
[02:55:14.661 --> 02:55:20.922]  Let's go to Tyler in FEMA Region 2, whatever former state that was on the East Coast.
[02:55:21.303 --> 02:55:22.503]  Tyler, you're on the air with Tim Kennedy.
[02:55:22.543 --> 02:55:22.823]  Go ahead.
[02:55:24.105 --> 02:55:39.968]  Um, yeah, so I wanted to get you in terms of changing, um, I get a Princeton, I'm actually an Army ROTC, uh, and I recently, I had to jump through a bunch of hoops basically to get a concealed carry permit in the state of New Jersey.
[02:55:40.749 --> 02:55:46.950]  And I was called back a week after posting pictures of me and some friends at a range saying that,
[02:55:47.552 --> 02:55:54.537]  If I promote the Second Amendment, I may be in violation of the Hatchet Act, and then I could basically have my ROTC scholarship ripped away.
[02:55:54.557 --> 02:55:55.237]  So there you go.
[02:55:55.337 --> 02:56:00.901]  If you are seen promoting the Second Amendment legally and lawfully, you might lose your ROTC commission.
[02:56:00.941 --> 02:56:02.823]  Seen the First Amendment bullying.
[02:56:03.463 --> 02:56:04.824]  So what's your specific question, sir?
[02:56:06.265 --> 02:56:10.728]  I was just asked, I just wanted to know, as far as
[02:56:11.164 --> 02:56:14.305]  Like, when I see the people I go to school with, they're total sheep.
[02:56:14.485 --> 02:56:18.467]  It's almost like they worship the idea of being destroyed, like lambs to the slaughter.
[02:56:19.287 --> 02:56:30.112]  And their solution would be to basically roll over to it, whereas most people... So your question is, what do you do living in a gun-free zone with a bunch of sheep?
[02:56:30.132 --> 02:56:30.752]  Great question.
[02:56:31.112 --> 02:56:33.333]  Talking to the ultimate sheepdog here, Tim Kennedy.
[02:56:33.353 --> 02:56:33.493]  Tim?
[02:56:36.841 --> 02:56:39.783]  What is preventing me from killing Alex across from me right now?
[02:56:40.323 --> 02:56:41.283]  Do I need a gun to do it?
[02:56:41.684 --> 02:56:42.264]  I don't.
[02:56:42.304 --> 02:56:43.004]  He's holding a pen.
[02:56:43.024 --> 02:56:44.265]  I got a metal mic in front of me.
[02:56:44.285 --> 02:56:45.185]  I'm sitting on top of a chair.
[02:56:45.205 --> 02:56:48.807]  The idea of being a victim, first and foremost, is
[02:56:51.383 --> 02:56:51.583]  You're
[02:57:10.766 --> 02:57:13.209]  Even in places where I can't carry, there's nothing I can do about it.
[02:57:13.229 --> 02:57:17.713]  I'm going to be prepared as prepared can be in where I am.
[02:57:17.733 --> 02:57:20.556]  You're going to look at- Because those are the target zones these cowards hit.
[02:57:20.676 --> 02:57:21.537]  Absolutely.
[02:57:21.617 --> 02:57:27.523]  If I'm in a hospital and I can't have a gun, or if I am at an election center, you know I'm going to have a knife.
[02:57:27.783 --> 02:57:30.446]  And you know that the people around me, I'm going to have an escape plan.
[02:57:30.726 --> 02:57:32.528]  But first and foremost, I'm going to have an idea.
[02:57:32.548 --> 02:57:33.149]  I'm going to have
[02:57:33.909 --> 02:57:35.630]  A perception on not being a prey.
[02:57:35.750 --> 02:57:36.830]  I'm going to be a predator.
[02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:42.172]  I'm going to be standing there looking for that one guy that's nervous, that's sweaty, that's anxious, that's kind of looking around.
[02:57:42.192 --> 02:57:48.353]  You know, you can push... And the truth is, that's just a normal instinct for a man, especially, to shift into that gear.
[02:57:48.373 --> 02:57:50.954]  Yeah, you know, it should be.
[02:57:51.334 --> 02:57:51.955]  It's not right now.
[02:57:51.975 --> 02:57:53.775]  I love that you're saying that.
[02:57:54.015 --> 02:57:56.496]  It should be a natural, normal instinct for a guy to be able to do that.
[02:57:56.636 --> 02:58:00.619]  When I walk out in the parking lot with my kids, I just look around, what's going on?
[02:58:00.719 --> 02:58:01.279]  You are rare.
[02:58:01.579 --> 02:58:02.540]  You are one in a hundred.
[02:58:02.660 --> 02:58:03.240]  I promise you.
[02:58:03.260 --> 02:58:04.121]  You're like most people.
[02:58:04.561 --> 02:58:07.743]  So in my course, I take guys to a supermarket.
[02:58:07.763 --> 02:58:09.084]  I say, let's walk around this parking lot.
[02:58:09.344 --> 02:58:11.866]  Let's make some assumptions about who drives this car.
[02:58:12.286 --> 02:58:13.406]  Is that person shoplifting?
[02:58:13.567 --> 02:58:16.869]  And people, for the first time, I think in their lives,
[02:58:17.529 --> 02:58:27.575]  Go from looking at their phones or pushing their car or looking at their kids to bringing their head up and looking around and seeing a war around them and all of the threats that are around them and they've just been ignorant their entire life.
[02:58:27.735 --> 02:58:31.277]  It's rare that you have somebody like yourself that's gonna go out and look and see what's there.
[02:58:31.577 --> 02:58:32.218]  That's the start.
[02:58:32.258 --> 02:58:33.438]  And that goes for politics too.
[02:58:33.458 --> 02:58:36.080]  We're being overrun by tyranny because people are unconscious.
[02:58:36.100 --> 02:58:36.880]  That was a great question.
[02:58:36.900 --> 02:58:38.982]  We're gonna come back with more questions with Tim Kemeny.
[02:58:39.242 --> 02:58:42.724]  Fourth hour, we got Duke coming up and I'm gonna hog about 15 more minutes if you'll do it.
[02:58:43.084 --> 02:58:45.607]  We're going to meet about some exciting stuff behind the scenes.
[02:58:45.627 --> 02:58:46.248]  Stay with us folks.
[02:58:46.428 --> 02:58:46.728]  4th Hour.
[02:58:47.029 --> 02:58:48.590]  Infowars.com forward slash show.

[03:00:07.423 --> 03:00:12.472]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:12.832 --> 03:00:15.116]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:18.365 --> 03:00:19.885]  Alright, Rob Deuce popping in at the 8 after.
[03:00:19.965 --> 03:00:22.306]  We're going to go to about 15 after to take your phone calls.
[03:00:22.346 --> 03:00:23.406]  We got Tim Kennedy here.
[03:00:24.406 --> 03:00:27.747]  And, uh, he didn't want to brag about his exploits and his background and all the rest of it.
[03:00:28.287 --> 03:00:29.227]  Uh, but it is amazing.
[03:00:29.267 --> 03:00:31.648]  In fact, sometime you've got to come in because I know you've mentioned it and I looked it up.
[03:00:32.088 --> 03:00:34.088]  But, uh, I guess you were in some of the same operations.
[03:00:34.108 --> 03:00:34.968]  He was a Navy SEAL.
[03:00:35.008 --> 03:00:38.949]  You were in the Army as one of their top snipers doing overwatch.
[03:00:38.969 --> 03:00:41.830]  I guess he did nighttime, you did daytime or vice versa.
[03:00:41.850 --> 03:00:44.770]  But you chewed some of the same dirt, uh, as Chris Kyle.
[03:00:45.411 --> 03:00:47.271]  Yeah, the, uh, you know,
[03:00:48.695 --> 03:00:59.068]  At the beginning of the war, after 9-11, even Iraq 2, special forces, special operations has grown dramatically in the past 5-8 years.
[03:01:00.831 --> 03:01:06.157]  10 years ago, there was not the same population of guys that could do what we do.
[03:01:06.978 --> 03:01:07.519]  I don't know.
[03:01:26.800 --> 03:01:29.362]  So you're saying from what you know that movie is pretty accurate?
[03:01:54.069 --> 03:01:54.810]  Hollywood's Hollywood.
[03:01:55.190 --> 03:02:01.115]  They're going to exaggerate certain elements and then to fit an agenda, they're going to dilute certain things.
[03:02:02.236 --> 03:02:04.258]  But that movie was close.
[03:02:04.298 --> 03:02:13.105]  They did a great job really trying to understand the essence of what that job entails, the sacrifice that it takes, both on a personal... So he was a super patriot and a great guy?
[03:02:13.445 --> 03:02:16.287]  That guy, um, was an amazing human.
[03:02:16.787 --> 03:02:17.608]  Well, there you go.
[03:02:17.668 --> 03:02:23.332]  So I believe you, uh, because you say it, because you've seen all the stuff that the fights and about out there and I've been neutral on the whole deal.
[03:02:23.952 --> 03:02:33.239]  Uh, and when I was talking to Chris call once before he died, cause I was also friends with Jesse Ventura, I, you know, he was sounding pretty legitimate on the radio with me saying, no, you know, that, that stuff really happened.
[03:02:33.579 --> 03:02:35.841]  Very, very sad that somebody with PTSD did that.
[03:02:36.221 --> 03:02:42.784]  Yeah, I was actually just a month ago on Dan Alosha's show with his widow.
[03:02:43.524 --> 03:02:44.865]  And she's a shooter too.
[03:02:45.225 --> 03:02:47.666]  She's an amazing patriot, Mrs. Kyle.
[03:02:48.406 --> 03:02:53.468]  She can shoot better than probably like 99.9% of the American population.
[03:02:54.408 --> 03:02:55.349]  She is, I would say,
[03:02:56.189 --> 03:02:57.729]  She is like talent.
[03:02:57.890 --> 03:02:58.790]  Sniper level talent.
[03:02:58.890 --> 03:02:59.270]  She's good.
[03:03:00.030 --> 03:03:02.351]  But that woman bleeds red, white, and blue.
[03:03:02.951 --> 03:03:04.271]  And that's just a testament.
[03:03:04.291 --> 03:03:06.052]  I've seen her on the news, depending on the Second Amendment.
[03:03:06.152 --> 03:03:06.332]  Yeah.
[03:03:06.632 --> 03:03:15.195]  I mean, if a guy like that is going to marry a woman like that, and do the things that he did, and pull the triggers on the guys that he did, that is a badass.
[03:03:15.335 --> 03:03:15.955]  That's a good dude.
[03:03:16.515 --> 03:03:16.715]  Yeah.
[03:03:17.155 --> 03:03:18.916]  Throw stones if you want, but that's a great human.
[03:03:19.176 --> 03:03:22.717]  What are the farthest shots you know of, and what's the best rifle at super long distance?
[03:03:25.729 --> 03:03:27.309]  I love the .338 Lapua.
[03:03:27.750 --> 03:03:30.050]  It's a very flat trajectory round.
[03:03:30.590 --> 03:03:31.751]  It's a fast traveling bullet.
[03:03:31.771 --> 03:03:33.171]  The velocity, the ballistics are good.
[03:03:33.491 --> 03:03:34.771]  And that was Kyle's favorite too, right?
[03:03:35.412 --> 03:03:40.593]  Man, I think guys that engage targets anywhere from 1,000 to 2,000 meters, that's a money shotgun.
[03:03:41.213 --> 03:03:47.315]  They're very confident in the easy math that goes into wind adjustments and BDC, the bullet drop.
[03:03:48.235 --> 03:03:48.995]  It's a good gun.
[03:03:50.287 --> 03:03:50.527]  Wow.
[03:03:51.027 --> 03:03:52.628]  Well, we're gonna go to break here in about a minute.
[03:03:52.668 --> 03:03:57.911]  Come back and do 10 more minutes of calls with Mike and Andrew and Alan and Romo and Dan, so have your questions ready.
[03:03:58.551 --> 03:03:59.712]  We got about a minute till break.
[03:03:59.972 --> 03:04:02.613]  What's another little tidbit just about what's happening in the world?
[03:04:02.633 --> 03:04:03.313]  Take the election.
[03:04:03.333 --> 03:04:04.094]  Where are you on the election?
[03:04:06.501 --> 03:04:23.491]  So you have these talking heads right now that are running their mouths like, I'm gonna go to Syria and do this, to Iraq to do that, to Afghanistan to do that, but none of them have effectively served a day in their life in that capacity, in that role.
[03:04:24.112 --> 03:04:26.713]  Left or right, I have so many issues with both candidates.
[03:04:27.774 --> 03:04:29.457]  It looks like it's gonna be Hillary and it's gonna be Trump.
[03:04:30.839 --> 03:04:31.701]  How different are they?
[03:04:32.562 --> 03:04:36.849]  Which one of them is really gonna stand up and say, okay, this is America, I'm gonna fight for it, I believe in it.
[03:04:40.051 --> 03:04:41.092]  Which one is the most honest?
[03:04:41.152 --> 03:04:42.493]  And I'm on the fence.
[03:04:43.054 --> 03:04:47.558]  I love that finally we're at a place where people are talking about it, or they're being empowered, they're being passionate.
[03:04:48.258 --> 03:04:52.142]  No, you should not go into a highway and try to stand and prevent traffic from moving.
[03:04:52.442 --> 03:04:56.846]  Somebody that drives an American-made vehicle like a Jeep or a Ford is gonna run you over, so get off the road.
[03:04:59.168 --> 03:05:00.490]  It's gonna be a crazy November.
[03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:01.391]  It's gonna be crazy.
[03:05:01.411 --> 03:05:02.051]  I agree.
[03:05:02.092 --> 03:05:03.173]  We know Hillary's bad.
[03:05:03.233 --> 03:05:04.534]  Trump says a lot of good things.
[03:05:04.554 --> 03:05:05.675]  The question is, is he for real?
[03:05:05.775 --> 03:05:06.116]  We'll be back.
[03:05:06.236 --> 03:05:14.365]  Marines across the Corps will be challenged on their unconscious prejudice as women get the opportunity to become grunts for the first time.
[03:05:14.665 --> 03:05:16.547]  ReportsMilitary.com.
[03:05:16.768 --> 03:05:29.583]  The Military Corps is rolling out mandatory training for all Marines before the first future female rifleman hits boot camp, aiming to set conditions for a smooth transition and head off cultural resistance.
[03:05:30.023 --> 03:05:39.627]  Mobile training teams will be dispatched to installations across the Corps throughout May and June to offer a two-day seminar to Majors and Lieutenant Colonels.
[03:05:39.927 --> 03:05:49.850]  Topics include unconscious bias, which focuses on how people prejudge others based on factors such as race and gender, and principles of institutional change.
[03:05:50.271 --> 03:05:59.294]  A survey obtained by the Washington Post found that the majority of male Marines at every rank opposed the decision to have women serve in combat jobs.

[03:07:05.956 --> 03:07:12.339]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[03:07:12.819 --> 03:07:15.880]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[03:07:16.200 --> 03:07:19.762]  Needed to get my digestive system working correctly again.
[03:07:19.842 --> 03:07:21.863]  So I stumbled on the X2.
[03:07:22.183 --> 03:07:29.506]  When we look at a product like Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[03:07:29.826 --> 03:07:31.607]  I needed a detox basically.
[03:07:31.947 --> 03:07:32.707]  I started taking X2.
[03:07:36.562 --> 03:07:40.006]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[03:07:40.206 --> 03:07:41.268]  What do you have to lose?
[03:07:41.528 --> 03:07:50.099]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[03:07:50.564 --> 03:07:53.986]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[03:07:54.086 --> 03:07:55.908]  I was, like, really more natural.
[03:07:56.188 --> 03:08:01.371]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:08:01.391 --> 03:08:03.032]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[03:08:03.152 --> 03:08:07.915]  Broke my leg in the Santa Fe.
[03:08:07.935 --> 03:08:09.336]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[03:08:21.913 --> 03:08:25.262]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:08:27.924 --> 03:08:29.764]  Well, Tim Kennedy is amazing.
[03:08:29.784 --> 03:08:35.167]  You know, I've known him for a while, and I know a lot of other folks, former and current military and special ops.
[03:08:35.207 --> 03:08:36.407]  They're just all patriots.
[03:08:37.368 --> 03:08:40.549]  I mean, you like them on air, you really want to know them off air.
[03:08:40.589 --> 03:08:41.950]  These guys are just amazing.
[03:08:42.270 --> 03:08:48.753]  Hadn't told me anything secret, but you know, I know a lot of stuff going on from all my sources, and so it's just really, really interesting to talk to these guys.
[03:08:48.793 --> 03:08:51.894]  I want to go back to a few phone calls and hand the baton to Rob Doohey.
[03:08:51.914 --> 03:08:53.655]  He may have some questions for you, Tim, as well.
[03:08:54.355 --> 03:09:04.604]  But specifically, getting into Hillary and Trump, you were going off on somebody during the break, so I want to make clear though, lesser of two evils, you just don't want to go for that, but your view of Hillary Clinton, Benghazi, and the rest of it.
[03:09:06.266 --> 03:09:10.289]  What I don't like about the election is that you're choosing the lesser of two evils.
[03:09:10.410 --> 03:09:12.111]  I'm not saying that Trump's evil, I don't know.
[03:09:12.131 --> 03:09:19.658]  I haven't been able to grasp what the substance of what he's saying is, and his rhetoric has just kind of been a lot of pulp fiction, a lot of pop and fuzz.
[03:09:21.311 --> 03:09:22.071]  I hate Hillary Clinton.
[03:09:22.872 --> 03:09:31.295]  You know, from Benghazi, seeing my friends die, and then lying about it, saying it had to do with a video, and then saying she lied about it being a, like, just lie after lie after lie.
[03:09:31.475 --> 03:09:33.275]  And she's a war hero, like Brian Williams.
[03:09:34.176 --> 03:09:36.977]  Hey, let me get off a helicopter under sniper fire.
[03:09:37.837 --> 03:09:44.743]  As a dude that has been under lots of sniper fire, when you're coming out and shaking hands and kissing babies and patting people on the top of the head, that is not sniper fire.
[03:09:45.043 --> 03:09:51.448]  Sniper fire is when you are pushing your dick into the ground, you're like trying to claw yourself inches into the ground just so you can get a little bit lower.
[03:09:51.488 --> 03:09:52.649]  That's being under sniper fire.
[03:09:53.109 --> 03:09:56.932]  So shut your lying mouth and just be honest a couple of times.
[03:09:56.952 --> 03:10:03.638]  What I also don't understand is how, when you have never owned a company in your life
[03:10:04.358 --> 03:10:06.319]  You're worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[03:10:06.839 --> 03:10:13.123]  You've never done anything besides serve the American people, and you're worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[03:10:13.383 --> 03:10:14.083]  How does that make sense?
[03:10:14.103 --> 03:10:30.431]  Your Secretary of State not only do, so if I was in the Japanese culture, and I'm a leader of a group of people, and then two of my employees went and got murdered by the people that I'm there supposed to be fighting, I would have to take that samurai sword and fall on my sword to my death.
[03:10:30.752 --> 03:10:32.853]  But now she's running for president after
[03:10:33.971 --> 03:10:34.211]  First of
[03:10:53.371 --> 03:10:58.614]  She's worth hundreds of millions of dollars and she's never done anything besides work for the American people.
[03:10:58.634 --> 03:11:02.776]  Well, you're not just a good super soldier who rewrote the book for the Army on close quarters combat.
[03:11:02.796 --> 03:11:05.057]  You're a really good talk show host and a patriot.
[03:11:05.377 --> 03:11:05.957]  Sam Kennedy here.
[03:11:05.977 --> 03:11:07.258]  I want to race through some calls now.
[03:11:07.618 --> 03:11:12.520]  Since this next caller wants to ask about UFC, then we've got special ops questions.
[03:11:12.540 --> 03:11:13.901]  We're going to have to run through these fast.
[03:11:14.281 --> 03:11:16.162]  We're on a break in about nine minutes, and Drew's taking over.
[03:11:17.082 --> 03:11:19.564]  Tim, specifically, you are Mr. Clean.
[03:11:19.584 --> 03:11:21.625]  You've been tested a lot by the anti-doping group.
[03:11:21.965 --> 03:11:24.986]  You even have them test stuff for mainline supplements you take.
[03:11:25.046 --> 03:11:26.767]  Recently, I guess you just got tested last week.
[03:11:26.787 --> 03:11:27.327]  Tell us about that.
[03:11:27.587 --> 03:11:28.768]  Well, I didn't get tested once.
[03:11:28.908 --> 03:11:29.888]  I didn't get tested twice.
[03:11:30.369 --> 03:11:31.449]  I got tested three times.
[03:11:32.530 --> 03:11:33.470]  Blood, urine.
[03:11:33.530 --> 03:11:37.292]  In fact, show us Twitter, folks, or is it your Instagram shows them taking the blood or whatever.
[03:11:37.673 --> 03:11:46.113]  Yeah, nurses coming in, drawing blood from both my arms, and then the moment the inspectors arrive, they are following me around everywhere I go.
[03:11:48.356 --> 03:11:56.201]  You know, Pete, I haven't fought since USADA has come into effect with the, with Ultimate Fighting, and people are like, oh, is that guy, is it because he's dirty?
[03:11:56.341 --> 03:11:59.524]  Listen, man, I'm getting tested more than anybody else in the UFC.
[03:11:59.564 --> 03:12:00.484]  Because you're Mr. Clean?
[03:12:00.664 --> 03:12:02.906]  Because I, I, I have been very vocal.
[03:12:02.966 --> 03:12:07.869]  Well, you said that one guy that kind of cheated or whatever, like hit in the corner and barely beat you at the end, you already kicked his ass.
[03:12:08.089 --> 03:12:09.850]  You said, I guarantee he's dirty, and it turned out he was.
[03:12:10.071 --> 03:12:10.551]  Yeah.
[03:12:10.791 --> 03:12:12.352]  So, I'm not wrong very often.
[03:12:12.532 --> 03:12:15.493]  So, Yoel Romero is who we're specifically talking about.
[03:12:15.513 --> 03:12:19.234]  I was like, dude, I promise you that guy is not only a cheater in the ring, but he's a cheater outside of the ring.
[03:12:19.274 --> 03:12:23.415]  And lo and behold, he tested positive for anabolic steroids, a very expensive boutique one.
[03:12:24.456 --> 03:12:27.477]  But he and, you know, it's a rampant problem.
[03:12:27.637 --> 03:12:29.277]  And you want him again, but he won't do it, right?
[03:12:29.858 --> 03:12:30.298]  No.
[03:12:30.378 --> 03:12:31.618]  One, he's going to be suspended forever.
[03:12:31.638 --> 03:12:36.480]  That's what happens when you use... So, he got tested and I haven't... Have they released the results yet?
[03:12:37.659 --> 03:12:39.000]  One has, yeah.
[03:12:39.040 --> 03:12:41.082]  And it's not that you're on drugs, it's that you're from Krypton.
[03:12:41.382 --> 03:12:41.822]  Yeah, I know.
[03:12:42.182 --> 03:12:44.984]  I inject Wolverine blood directly into my eyeballs.
[03:12:46.245 --> 03:12:46.705]  There it is.
[03:12:47.245 --> 03:12:47.966]  Oh, I tell ya.
[03:12:48.426 --> 03:12:48.947]  Amazing.
[03:12:49.587 --> 03:12:53.349]  So, I mean, what is it, just genetics and focus that you've got in such good shape?
[03:12:53.670 --> 03:12:54.310]  It's hard work.
[03:12:55.070 --> 03:13:00.174]  Yeah, genetics, focus, but the biggest thing, individual responsibility, that's like
[03:13:01.013 --> 03:13:06.139]  One of the things that I really believe in that we're going to be talking about is, you know, being a libertarian has individual responsibility.
[03:13:06.159 --> 03:13:10.184]  And being a healthy, hard-working person is very symbiotic in that way.
[03:13:10.665 --> 03:13:12.467]  So, I train my ass off.
[03:13:12.667 --> 03:13:14.410]  You know, I train two, three times a day.
[03:13:14.530 --> 03:13:19.296]  I'm told of these top gyms in Austin, and I've been at some of them before, you guys train double what anybody else does.
[03:13:20.100 --> 03:13:20.761]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:13:20.781 --> 03:13:29.228]  You know, we can walk into any of these gyms and they have records up on the boards and they're saying, like, this is what Tommy did last week with his movement and this particular exercise.
[03:13:29.909 --> 03:13:32.491]  And, like, me and Shane... That's Aaron, isn't it?
[03:13:32.731 --> 03:13:32.951]  Yeah.
[03:13:33.432 --> 03:13:35.593]  We'll walk in there and be like, alright, what are your records right now?
[03:13:35.774 --> 03:13:37.235]  So I can just go ahead and crush those.
[03:13:38.256 --> 03:13:39.397]  And we can do that wherever we go.
[03:13:39.477 --> 03:13:40.218]  I love going to Auto Day.
[03:13:40.238 --> 03:13:42.620]  They have so many fantastic... Is Skyler not a maniac?
[03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:43.640]  Dude, he's just training...
[03:13:44.662 --> 03:13:44.982]  Freak!
[03:13:45.462 --> 03:13:46.443]  He's powerful, he's fast.
[03:13:46.463 --> 03:13:49.323]  Well, both his dad and his brother are top rodeo bull riders.
[03:13:49.344 --> 03:13:53.585]  Yeah, he's got genetics too, so don't think that, like, yes, he works hard, he trains hard.
[03:13:53.605 --> 03:13:55.806]  He's only been doing it a few years, he's already winning some big bouts.
[03:13:56.486 --> 03:13:59.067]  I saw that one guy he fought just last week was like twice as big as him.
[03:13:59.307 --> 03:13:59.707]  He's good.
[03:13:59.867 --> 03:14:00.747]  He's hard to submit.
[03:14:00.767 --> 03:14:01.847]  He's very, he's tough.
[03:14:02.128 --> 03:14:02.848]  He's talented, he's strong.
[03:14:02.868 --> 03:14:04.428]  Well, he says you still throw him around like a rag doll.
[03:14:04.928 --> 03:14:05.909]  Ah, this is a different level.
[03:14:07.093 --> 03:14:07.673]  Yeah.
[03:14:07.933 --> 03:14:09.554]  As long as I don't let him get his hands on me.
[03:14:09.634 --> 03:14:11.654]  If he gets his hands on me, I'm just going to fly through the air.
[03:14:11.694 --> 03:14:13.014]  He's very, very talented.
[03:14:13.294 --> 03:14:13.814]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:14:13.854 --> 03:14:15.475]  So I guess in a few years, he'll get better and better.
[03:14:15.495 --> 03:14:18.615]  Yeah, I'm going to start undermining his training.
[03:14:18.655 --> 03:14:22.576]  I'm going to start stealing his mouthpiece and peeing in his cup.
[03:14:23.456 --> 03:14:24.997]  Make sure he does good workout sessions.
[03:14:26.937 --> 03:14:27.957]  Tim Kennedy's our guest.
[03:14:28.518 --> 03:14:29.898]  Let's do the UFC question now.
[03:14:29.918 --> 03:14:30.778]  Andrew, you're on the air.
[03:14:30.798 --> 03:14:31.298]  Thanks for holding.
[03:14:32.418 --> 03:14:33.919]  Hey, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Jones.
[03:14:33.939 --> 03:14:34.739]  How are you guys doing today?
[03:14:34.779 --> 03:14:35.119]  Good, brother.
[03:14:36.121 --> 03:14:36.401]  Good.
[03:14:36.682 --> 03:14:37.522]  I just had a question.
[03:14:37.803 --> 03:14:40.786]  I recently watched a video of Phil Oliver and Andrew Young.
[03:14:41.186 --> 03:14:46.231]  They did an interview together where they talked about Longevity's Rebound and how LeBron James stayed on his rebound.
[03:14:46.251 --> 03:14:52.277]  And I was just wondering if Mr. Kennedy, if you've ever used Rebound or any of the InfoWars products and if you'd be allowed to use those.
[03:14:52.417 --> 03:14:52.677]  Sure.
[03:14:52.717 --> 03:14:53.898]  So one of those is another product.
[03:14:53.938 --> 03:14:55.260]  I wasn't going to bring that up today.
[03:14:55.300 --> 03:14:57.442]  Have you used any of the InfoWars live products?
[03:14:57.462 --> 03:14:58.022]  I have.
[03:14:58.122 --> 03:14:58.343]  Yeah.
[03:15:00.146 --> 03:15:00.346]  Do it.
[03:15:30.086 --> 03:15:32.988]  Yeah, Mr. Kennedy, I was wondering, how many former special ops are working for the feds and the government?
[03:15:33.008 --> 03:15:34.229]  Is there a high percentage?
[03:15:56.403 --> 03:15:56.783]  A lot.
[03:15:57.063 --> 03:15:59.985]  You know, you can't really separate them.
[03:16:00.345 --> 03:16:02.226]  The military is the federal government.
[03:16:02.806 --> 03:16:16.392]  Yes, we're supposed to be working overseas and not in the United States, but as the wars are dwindling down and we're doing less in Iraq and Afghanistan, you have a huge population of very talented war fighters, special operations guys, that are coming back and looking for jobs.
[03:16:16.753 --> 03:16:19.694]  It's a very, very quick and easy transfer.
[03:16:19.734 --> 03:16:21.615]  And the FBI is smart to want people like that.
[03:16:22.555 --> 03:16:27.116]  Yeah, this is the best population of the hard-working, trained guys on the planet.
[03:16:27.136 --> 03:16:38.219]  So whether you're going to FBI or you're going to CIA or you're going to your local police department, you can come to Austin or Houston or San Antonio and I know guys that I deployed with that are working there now that are heading up the SWAT.
[03:16:38.719 --> 03:16:39.699]  So there's a lot of them.
[03:16:40.099 --> 03:16:41.820]  It's not like some orchestrated design.
[03:16:43.120 --> 03:16:46.081]  These guys are coming back and they need jobs and these are great jobs for them.
[03:16:46.841 --> 03:16:53.025]  And it's a great opportunity for these federal agencies to grab fantastic, talented, trained people.
[03:16:53.105 --> 03:16:55.487]  They just better not follow orders to shoot unarmed farmers.
[03:16:55.907 --> 03:16:56.688]  I know, that's a bad idea.
[03:16:57.108 --> 03:16:58.489]  Alright, thank you for the call, Mike.
[03:16:58.509 --> 03:17:01.051]  Let's talk to Dan in Oregon, speaking of where this went down.
[03:17:01.091 --> 03:17:02.031]  Go ahead, Dan, you're on the air.
[03:17:03.072 --> 03:17:05.754]  Hey Alex, thanks so much for taking my call and for everything you do.
[03:17:05.794 --> 03:17:06.234]  Love the show.
[03:17:06.975 --> 03:17:07.375]  Thank you, brother.
[03:17:07.395 --> 03:17:07.815]  Go ahead.
[03:17:08.576 --> 03:17:11.498]  And Tim, thanks for you for protecting America and all that you do.
[03:17:12.569 --> 03:17:22.676]  Um, real quick on the Oregon thing, not my question, but LaVoy Finnegan and his, uh, and Iman Bundy and those guys were on their way to a town meeting with the sheriff, with over 400 people, probably to talk about what was going on.
[03:17:22.736 --> 03:17:25.517]  So that was definitely an assassination by the FBI, in my opinion.
[03:17:26.178 --> 03:17:30.861]  Um, so what I want to say about ISIS and everything that happened today, we know, Alex, that we're dealing with a spiritual war here, right?
[03:17:31.441 --> 03:17:33.343]  Uh, it's a spiritual war that we're trying to attack.
[03:17:33.723 --> 03:17:37.085]  With things that happened today, though, it does get manifested in the physical realm.
[03:17:37.445 --> 03:17:38.566]  So as Americans on the
[03:17:39.358 --> 03:17:40.822]  Government level on the high fed level.
[03:17:40.862 --> 03:17:44.149]  How do we attack that and again on the personal level like individuals us here?
[03:17:44.189 --> 03:17:45.332]  How do we how do we attack that?
[03:17:46.124 --> 03:17:48.145]  Without, again, being labeled Islamophobia.
[03:17:48.345 --> 03:17:49.545]  And do you think... Well, look, I mean, here's the deal.
[03:17:49.565 --> 03:17:51.846]  I know there's some Muslims that aren't murdering killers, okay?
[03:17:52.066 --> 03:17:53.186]  But they're bringing them in.
[03:17:53.386 --> 03:17:55.027]  Islam's being radicalized worldwide.
[03:17:55.307 --> 03:17:57.748]  Saudi Arabia's invading everywhere, putting their people in.
[03:17:58.128 --> 03:17:59.068]  And it's just survival.
[03:17:59.688 --> 03:18:01.329]  So, I mean, look, this is who's killing us.
[03:18:01.349 --> 03:18:02.269]  This is who's attacking us.
[03:18:02.529 --> 03:18:04.230]  I don't care if you call me Islamophobic.
[03:18:04.470 --> 03:18:07.971]  I don't care if you lie about me and say I'm racist, because I don't want Obamacare.
[03:18:07.991 --> 03:18:08.611]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[03:18:08.891 --> 03:18:09.391]  No, you're not.
[03:18:09.471 --> 03:18:11.032]  You're spot on.
[03:18:11.652 --> 03:18:13.113]  We have to win the propaganda war.
[03:18:14.773 --> 03:18:15.033]  I don't
[03:18:36.065 --> 03:18:36.666]  I think?
[03:18:56.603 --> 03:19:01.530]  Stop being victims and understand that these guys are going specifically for the poor and the uninformed.
[03:19:01.550 --> 03:19:13.327]  So if you're gonna stand up for the weak, if you're gonna stand up for the sheep, recognize that the ISIS and the like are going after the weakest people on the planet, not only to recruit them and then murder them, but then to ultimately try to commit terrorist acts.
[03:19:13.447 --> 03:19:13.907]  Thank you, Dan.
[03:19:13.947 --> 03:19:14.368]  Great question.
[03:19:14.388 --> 03:19:16.048]  Only one or two more calls and we're going to hand it to Rob Duhem.
[03:19:16.068 --> 03:19:16.649]  Skipping this break.
[03:19:17.069 --> 03:19:17.789]  Here's my issue.
[03:19:17.829 --> 03:19:22.052]  I had Colonel Schaefer on about this who ran the Stratus IV and, you know, all the rest of the operations.
[03:19:22.072 --> 03:19:25.093]  They could have killed bin Laden twice with operators like you guys.
[03:19:25.133 --> 03:19:27.655]  They were ordered to stand down by the CIA.
[03:19:28.015 --> 03:19:31.137]  And then we see countless examples where they won't let them take out the leadership.
[03:19:31.717 --> 03:19:37.220]  Now, I know that's changing, but isn't the answer, I know that's one of your specialties, you can't talk about it, isn't it take out the leadership?
[03:19:38.877 --> 03:19:45.285]  Yeah, obviously the best thing to do is you have to be able to take off the leadership without immortalizing them.
[03:19:45.305 --> 03:19:55.338]  You know, had you killed Bin Laden at certain times, he would have been then the flagship for martyrdom for that religion for the next 50 years.
[03:19:55.859 --> 03:19:59.921]  So you do think that that Obama raid and all that was real and no hanky panky?
[03:20:15.507 --> 03:20:18.269]  I know the guys that went to do it, and they're guys like me.
[03:20:19.310 --> 03:20:19.870]  Sure, I know.
[03:20:19.930 --> 03:20:25.834]  It's just, you know, some of the seals got blown up in the helicopter and the rest of it, and then they said it was a little suspicious.
[03:20:26.075 --> 03:20:26.495]  It was.
[03:20:26.915 --> 03:20:28.836]  Hey, I'll take your word for it.
[03:20:28.856 --> 03:20:30.558]  No, you can't take it, because I wasn't there.
[03:20:30.598 --> 03:20:34.741]  I'm just saying that the guys that would go to do that, and the guys that were there, those are shooters.
[03:20:34.861 --> 03:20:38.483]  Those are guys that are good at really one thing, and that's killing people.
[03:20:38.743 --> 03:20:42.046]  So, you don't send guys like that into Pakistan to do anything else but that.
[03:20:43.140 --> 03:20:46.883]  Sure, it's just that they're packed in a helicopter a month later.
[03:20:47.243 --> 03:20:48.144]  They all thought it was a setup.
[03:20:48.164 --> 03:20:49.905]  I've talked to some of their families and it blows up.
[03:20:50.806 --> 03:20:51.747]  Very, very suspicious.
[03:20:51.807 --> 03:20:57.371]  It just shows how they're trying to... I mean, I guess that's why the Army's smart, not allowing themselves to be politicized.
[03:20:57.391 --> 03:21:04.537]  And I know you love the Navy SEALs as well, but what about that split where more and more of the SEALs are ordered to be involved in political stuff?
[03:21:05.558 --> 03:21:06.278]  I don't understand it.
[03:21:08.280 --> 03:21:09.541]  Our motto is the quiet professionals.
[03:21:09.901 --> 03:21:10.502]  We're supposed to be
[03:21:12.756 --> 03:21:19.699]  The guys that can do our job and we're not going to be scrutinized because there's no opportunity to attack us because we're not saying anything.
[03:21:20.019 --> 03:21:25.862]  The best way that I could ever do a job is I go and I do it, I complete the mission, and then you never hear about it.
[03:21:25.922 --> 03:21:26.882]  That's a job well done.
[03:21:27.582 --> 03:21:33.005]  If I'm going on and I'm writing a book or I'm saying, hey, I did this or I did that, let me make a movie about it, let me do a TV show about it.
[03:21:34.325 --> 03:21:37.749]  Nah, man, you maybe need to get into a different field.
[03:21:37.890 --> 03:21:39.491]  That also makes you a target later.
[03:21:39.732 --> 03:21:40.192]  Absolutely.
[03:21:40.212 --> 03:21:42.014]  So it's scary.
[03:21:42.034 --> 03:21:42.415]  I don't know.
[03:21:43.596 --> 03:21:50.785]  There is a shift right now where they're kind of allowing or even encouraging people to do more public activities, which I don't understand.
[03:21:50.805 --> 03:21:51.505]  So I don't know.
[03:21:51.626 --> 03:21:52.246]  You're not doing it.
[03:21:53.067 --> 03:21:55.068]  Um, I'm always, I'm, you can't shut me up.
[03:21:55.108 --> 03:21:57.429]  You're talking about freedom in general though, you're not talking about operations.
[03:21:57.489 --> 03:22:01.071]  No, no, you're not gonna, like, I'm vague and ambiguous here.
[03:22:01.491 --> 03:22:09.095]  I am always, when I'm talking about, you know, things I've done previously, uh, but right now, uh, you know, you can't shut me up when it comes to freedom.
[03:22:10.447 --> 03:22:11.508]  Well, I can't even get into it.
[03:22:11.628 --> 03:22:13.270]  It's all very, very interesting, obviously.
[03:22:13.310 --> 03:22:17.776]  All I know is it's the opposite of what these universities are producing with these leftists.
[03:22:18.116 --> 03:22:25.005]  I'm not even attacking leftists, but they are so soft, so dumbed down, so disconnected from reality, compared to people that actually go out and do something.
[03:22:25.065 --> 03:22:25.646]  It's amazing.
[03:22:26.006 --> 03:22:27.909]  I want to go to all these other calls, but I want to...
[03:22:29.338 --> 03:22:37.543]  I want to be able to also hand this over to Rob Due and get to some of the other points, but sorry to other callers, Rob Due will be able to go to you.
[03:22:37.803 --> 03:22:45.748]  I wanted to bring Rob Due in, who's co-hosting this fourth hour today, and have him with one question for Tim Kennedy, and then I'm going to hand the baton to Rob Due.
[03:22:46.048 --> 03:22:46.528]  Go ahead, Rob.
[03:22:46.888 --> 03:22:47.128]  Sure.
[03:22:47.188 --> 03:22:56.334]  Hey, Tim, there was an ISIS attack on about 200 Marines, I believe it was in Iraq just recently, and they ended up killing Staff Sergeant Luis Carden.
[03:22:57.214 --> 03:22:58.735]  And what do you know about that?
[03:22:58.755 --> 03:23:00.516]  Do you know how ISIS got that intelligence?
[03:23:00.556 --> 03:23:03.297]  Because people are kind of unsure of how that went down.
[03:23:03.317 --> 03:23:06.739]  I don't know a lot of the details.
[03:23:06.859 --> 03:23:11.842]  My understanding is that it was at a Ford operating base and that it's not a hard...
[03:23:14.029 --> 03:23:20.876]  It's not easy to hide where you are when you're a bunch of Marines.
[03:23:20.976 --> 03:23:24.339]  You're 200 Marines in Iraq, a forward operating base.
[03:23:24.419 --> 03:23:27.262]  It's very recognizable, identifiable.
[03:23:27.603 --> 03:23:33.669]  So they figured out where they were, and then there was a rocket attack that was coordinated with some small arms fire.
[03:23:34.510 --> 03:23:34.910]  Pretty basic.
[03:23:37.671 --> 03:23:38.051]  That's pathetic.
[03:23:55.023 --> 03:23:56.944]  Ninjas in camouflage.
[03:23:57.064 --> 03:23:58.045]  Let's be realistic.
[03:23:58.285 --> 03:23:59.726]  The moment that we land, they know that we're there.
[03:24:00.066 --> 03:24:01.627]  And we have to recognize that.
[03:24:01.667 --> 03:24:02.707]  We have to be aware of that.
[03:24:03.548 --> 03:24:04.208]  They're very good.
[03:24:04.228 --> 03:24:07.570]  They have 13-year-olds with cell phones walking around following us everywhere we go.
[03:24:07.590 --> 03:24:12.732]  So we take that and everything with our secrecy with a grain of salt.
[03:24:14.053 --> 03:24:14.473]  I don't get that.
[03:24:33.732 --> 03:24:37.333]  I've been in the military, but I know those bases just stick out like sore thumbs.
[03:24:37.373 --> 03:24:38.273]  Everybody knows where they are.
[03:24:38.633 --> 03:24:40.114]  Alright, well, Tim Kennedy, thank you so much.
[03:24:40.134 --> 03:24:41.734]  We're going to rob you here just in a moment.
[03:24:42.054 --> 03:24:52.057]  People can find out more at TimKennedyMMA.com, Twitter.com forward slash TimKennedyMMA, Facebook.com forward slash Tim Kennedy, and of course, tell folks about the Sheepdog website as well.
[03:24:52.995 --> 03:24:53.656]  Sheepdog Response.
[03:24:53.676 --> 03:24:54.256]  You can Google it.
[03:24:54.276 --> 03:24:55.237]  You can go to Facebook.
[03:24:55.557 --> 03:24:56.517]  You know, Sheepdog Response.
[03:24:56.658 --> 03:24:57.898]  SheepdogResponse.com.
[03:24:58.038 --> 03:25:02.121]  You're also involved with Ranger Up, Great Patriot Apparel, and a lot more.
[03:25:02.141 --> 03:25:04.042]  I love the fact you guys promote the Founding Fathers.
[03:25:04.663 --> 03:25:05.884]  Tim, thank you so much for the time today.
[03:25:05.904 --> 03:25:06.444]  It's been amazing.
[03:25:06.564 --> 03:25:06.724]  Always.
[03:25:06.744 --> 03:25:07.345]  Love talking to you.
[03:25:07.365 --> 03:25:10.827]  I want to thank Shane for coming in as well after you guys trained for about four hours this morning.
[03:25:11.087 --> 03:25:11.928]  We got some video of that.
[03:25:11.948 --> 03:25:13.809]  We'll be here in the next few days as well on the nightly news.
[03:25:14.429 --> 03:25:22.355]  Over to you and all the latest breaking news and of course the big terror attacks that happened in Belgium that are being blamed on Donald Trump right now.
[03:25:22.515 --> 03:25:22.855]  Rob Duke.
[03:25:23.456 --> 03:25:23.956]  That's right.
[03:25:24.837 --> 03:25:26.338]  Everything is Donald Trump's fault.
[03:25:27.399 --> 03:25:29.221]  Ted Cruz came out and said, I'm going to play that clip.
[03:25:29.241 --> 03:25:35.887]  I'm also going to play some old clips from Donald Trump saying Brussels is a hellhole, essentially, with what's going on there.
[03:25:35.987 --> 03:25:44.335]  And then we're going to look at a clip from Jimmy Carter, the Jimmy Carter administration during the Iran hostage crisis, where he banned Iranians from coming into the country.
[03:25:45.996 --> 03:25:47.697]  You know, nobody said anything.
[03:25:47.777 --> 03:25:49.198]  Nobody called him a racist then.
[03:25:50.019 --> 03:25:50.919]  There was no outcry.
[03:25:50.979 --> 03:25:55.002]  It was just, well, that's what you do when you're at war with a group of people.
[03:25:55.423 --> 03:25:56.723]  But first, let's look at this article.
[03:25:56.844 --> 03:26:02.748]  Obama trolled over Brussels attacks after calling global warming a greatest threat to humanity.
[03:26:03.188 --> 03:26:06.470]  Even though we know it's not global warming anymore, it's cooling.
[03:26:06.630 --> 03:26:12.995]  We've been in a 13-year cooling cycle, but don't tell the guys at NOAA who've been faking the data for years.
[03:26:13.835 --> 03:26:17.659]  No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.
[03:26:17.679 --> 03:26:19.901]  And here's what some of the people responded back.
[03:26:20.362 --> 03:26:22.283]  Climate change has rid its ugly head in Brussels.
[03:26:22.464 --> 03:26:23.645]  Amazing insanity.
[03:26:24.145 --> 03:26:24.506]  Breaking.
[03:26:24.566 --> 03:26:27.989]  Climate change just claimed responsibility for attacks in Brussels, killing 30.
[03:26:28.970 --> 03:26:30.171]  Climate change strikes again.
[03:26:30.191 --> 03:26:35.656]  Yo Obama, fly the family over to Brussels and explain how climate change is the biggest threat.
[03:26:36.462 --> 03:26:40.664]  Well someone please ask the people of Brussels how much climate change affected what happened this morning.
[03:26:41.244 --> 03:26:46.526]  If your elected officials think climate change is a bigger threat than, or a bigger problem than terrorism, unelect them.
[03:26:46.546 --> 03:26:48.547]  So that's just some of them.
[03:26:48.967 --> 03:26:51.689]  And then I love this cartoon from Ben Garrison.
[03:26:51.729 --> 03:26:54.970]  It's got terrorism and Obama wearing the same turban.
[03:26:55.810 --> 03:26:57.311]  So there'll be that.
[03:26:57.351 --> 03:27:02.313]  But let's go to that first video with Donald Trump saying Brussels is like living in a hellhole.
[03:27:02.333 --> 03:27:02.993]  He said this back in 2012.
[03:27:05.006 --> 03:27:08.253]  You don't think you've alienated people?
[03:27:08.313 --> 03:27:10.818]  I mean, come on, you don't think you've alienated people?
[03:27:17.014 --> 03:27:21.178]  Whether it was with respect to the Muslims, hey, Maria, there's something going on.
[03:27:21.618 --> 03:27:25.842]  And we have a president that doesn't want to even talk about radical Islamic terrorism.
[03:27:26.303 --> 03:27:27.243]  I bring people together.
[03:27:27.584 --> 03:27:31.187]  I've had Muslims call me up and say, thank you, because they need dialogue.
[03:27:31.787 --> 03:27:33.169]  I bring people together.
[03:27:33.529 --> 03:27:35.631]  Obama has been the great divider.
[03:27:35.731 --> 03:27:46.125]  To be fair on the Muslim comment, I mean, we do admit 100,000 Muslims on a permanent basis here every year, and this is going to be the lar- or is already the largest religion in the world.
[03:27:46.145 --> 03:27:48.128]  Can you really say let's do a temporary halt?
[03:27:49.266 --> 03:27:50.907]  There's something going on, Maria.
[03:27:51.187 --> 03:27:51.988]  Go to Brussels.
[03:27:52.348 --> 03:27:53.149]  Go to Paris.
[03:27:53.509 --> 03:27:54.810]  Go to different places.
[03:27:55.270 --> 03:27:56.551]  There's something going on.
[03:27:56.731 --> 03:27:57.692]  And it's not good.
[03:27:58.032 --> 03:27:59.393]  Where they want your real law.
[03:27:59.473 --> 03:28:00.353]  Where they want this.
[03:28:00.394 --> 03:28:03.796]  Where they want things that... You know, there has to be some assimilation.
[03:28:03.976 --> 03:28:05.117]  There is no assimilation.
[03:28:05.477 --> 03:28:07.038]  There's something bad going on.
[03:28:07.158 --> 03:28:11.201]  And until we find out what it is, so we can correct it... You go to Brussels.
[03:28:11.301 --> 03:28:13.002]  I was in Brussels a long time ago.
[03:28:13.222 --> 03:28:13.642]  20 years ago.
[03:28:14.023 --> 03:28:14.983]  So beautiful.
[03:28:15.023 --> 03:28:15.824]  Everything's so beautiful.
[03:28:16.608 --> 03:28:18.670]  It's like living in a hellhole right now.
[03:28:19.110 --> 03:28:21.772]  You go to these different places, there's something going on.
[03:28:23.173 --> 03:28:26.075]  To quote Spinal Tap, living in a hellhole.
[03:28:26.915 --> 03:28:37.323]  Now let's go to Ted Cruz, who basically came out on the tarmac today and said, you know, a day after Trump says we got to get out of NATO, he also said some things about the UN and that they're ineffectual.
[03:28:37.883 --> 03:28:39.024]  Oh, there's a terrorist attack.
[03:28:39.084 --> 03:28:41.466]  So kind of putting two and two together.
[03:28:41.506 --> 03:28:43.467]  Definitely a jab in his direction.
[03:28:43.487 --> 03:28:44.228]  Let's play that video.
[03:28:45.694 --> 03:29:07.732]  Well, I will say, it is striking that the day after Donald Trump called for America weakening NATO, withdrawing from NATO, we see Brussels, where NATO is headquartered, the subject of a radical Islamic terrorist attack.
[03:29:08.800 --> 03:29:09.261]  There you go.
[03:29:09.381 --> 03:29:12.425]  And now let's go to Trump's response to Brussels.
[03:29:12.445 --> 03:29:13.947]  He just said this this morning.
[03:29:14.127 --> 03:29:14.527]  Here it is.
[03:29:14.888 --> 03:29:16.970]  We have to be very careful in the United States.
[03:29:16.990 --> 03:29:20.996]  We have to be very, very vigilant as to who we allow into this country.
[03:29:21.676 --> 03:29:26.623]  If you do become president and we're in a situation like this, what would you do to protect America?
[03:29:28.266 --> 03:29:29.787]  Well, again, I think I've said it.
[03:29:30.487 --> 03:29:34.430]  I would close up our borders to people until we figure out what is going on.
[03:29:34.450 --> 03:29:35.610]  Look at Brussels.
[03:29:35.670 --> 03:29:36.431]  Look at Paris.
[03:29:36.491 --> 03:29:39.273]  Look at so many cities that were great cities.
[03:29:39.333 --> 03:29:42.034]  Paris is almost as bad.
[03:29:42.955 --> 03:29:46.817]  If you look at Paris... Yeah, we are definitely... Europe is definitely being overrun.
[03:29:46.857 --> 03:29:49.819]  But here's a Washington Examiner article from late last year.
[03:29:49.859 --> 03:29:52.961]  Coming soon, more immigrants from Muslim nations in the population of D.C.
[03:29:52.981 --> 03:29:52.961]  680,000.
[03:29:53.001 --> 03:29:54.562]  We'll be back with more after this break.
[03:29:56.983 --> 03:29:58.586]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:59.508 --> 03:30:02.193]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:06.278 --> 03:30:14.446]  Marines across the Corps will be challenged on their unconscious prejudice as women get the opportunity to become grunts for the first time.
[03:30:14.706 --> 03:30:16.608]  ReportsMilitary.com.
[03:30:16.828 --> 03:30:29.620]  The Military Corps is rolling out mandatory training for all Marines before the first future female rifleman hits boot camp, aiming to set conditions for a smooth transition and head off cultural resistance.
[03:30:30.060 --> 03:30:39.667]  Mobile training teams will be dispatched to installations across the Corps throughout May and June to offer a two-day seminar to Majors and Lieutenant Colonels.
[03:30:39.967 --> 03:30:49.895]  Topics include unconscious bias, which focuses on how people prejudge others based on factors such as race and gender, and principles of institutional change.
[03:30:50.315 --> 03:30:59.342]  A survey obtained by the Washington Post found that the majority of male Marines at every rank opposed the decision to have women serve in combat jobs.
[03:30:59.763 --> 03:31:03.618]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com
[03:31:06.832 --> 03:31:09.233]  Toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:09.533 --> 03:31:17.535]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:17.755 --> 03:31:22.796]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:31:23.196 --> 03:31:25.477]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[03:33:09.403 --> 03:33:12.406]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:33:12.986 --> 03:33:17.130]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:31.237 --> 03:33:33.217]  Well, that brings us into the fourth hour.
[03:33:33.237 --> 03:33:34.318]  I'm your host Rob Dew.

[03:33:38.399 --> 03:33:38.779]  Central.

[03:33:41.879 --> 03:33:42.239]  Central.
[03:33:42.360 --> 03:33:44.280]  And tonight, the nightly news at 7 p.m.
[03:33:44.320 --> 03:33:44.720]  Central.
[03:33:45.200 --> 03:33:49.081]  And you can watch a video of these all at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:33:49.101 --> 03:33:52.522]  And somebody's calling me.
[03:33:54.757 --> 03:33:58.740]  Anyway, I want to bring your attention to a tweet that I put out this morning.
[03:33:59.740 --> 03:34:02.302]  PC Insanity Invasion Not Immigration.
[03:34:02.402 --> 03:34:04.443]  It's from a Reddit called The Donald.
[03:34:04.923 --> 03:34:07.204]  And I'm going to bring this up full screen right here.
[03:34:07.265 --> 03:34:07.945]  This is the link.
[03:34:08.045 --> 03:34:12.808]  Belgian teacher, how do you teach a class when all the Muslim children in your class are plotting terrorist attacks?
[03:34:15.603 --> 03:34:19.846]  And the Marisons police to his door for this tweet asking him not to post these kind of things in the future.
[03:34:19.866 --> 03:34:23.369]  I don't know if that's true or not, but that's ridiculous if that's what's happening.
[03:34:23.389 --> 03:34:25.350]  Of course, you're not supposed to speak out.
[03:34:26.030 --> 03:34:27.331]  We're just supposed to let more and more in.
[03:34:27.351 --> 03:34:35.698]  That's why they're having these problems in Brussels, in France, because they don't speak out and they leave their doors wide open to anybody who wants to come in.
[03:34:35.958 --> 03:34:37.419]  And they don't properly vet these people.
[03:34:37.979 --> 03:34:43.384]  In fact, Joe Biggs, Michael Zimmerman, and Paul Joseph Watson took a train from Brussels to France.
[03:34:43.404 --> 03:34:45.105]  Didn't even have to go through a border checkpoint.
[03:34:45.125 --> 03:34:46.166]  It's wide open.
[03:34:46.466 --> 03:34:47.147]  Hey, come on in.
[03:34:48.228 --> 03:34:50.650]  And that's where the attackers originated from Paris.
[03:34:50.690 --> 03:34:51.731]  They originated from Brussels.
[03:34:52.211 --> 03:34:53.772]  Right now we're running a cleanse special.
[03:34:54.293 --> 03:34:56.755]  You got 10% off liver shield or deep cleanse.
[03:34:56.775 --> 03:34:57.836]  You can take your pick off that.
[03:34:58.656 --> 03:35:05.322]  15% off the ultimate cleanse pack, which is liver shield and deep cleanse together, which is like the one-two punch.
[03:35:05.342 --> 03:35:06.203]  And then if you really
[03:35:06.843 --> 03:35:08.045]  Want to get your body clean?
[03:35:08.065 --> 03:35:12.831]  20% off the Ultimate Cleanse Pack, plus Oxy Powder.
[03:35:12.851 --> 03:35:20.021]  So it's Liver Shield Deep Cleanse and Oxy Powder, and I guarantee you, you will feel the results of Oxy Powder.
[03:35:20.281 --> 03:35:21.943]  I mean, it is amazing.
[03:35:25.086 --> 03:35:28.287]  I think the first time I took it, I lost about 12 pounds in a week.
[03:35:29.067 --> 03:35:30.627]  Second time, I only did it for four days.
[03:35:31.188 --> 03:35:35.689]  And the first two, I could feel the toxins coming out of my body and I was very irritable.
[03:35:36.349 --> 03:35:39.930]  And then the third and fourth day were just like nirvana.
[03:35:39.970 --> 03:35:41.970]  I was like, ah, I feel so good.
[03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:44.191]  It really is amazing.
[03:35:44.991 --> 03:35:49.932]  It really is amazing what goes on when your body starts cleansing itself.
[03:35:50.552 --> 03:35:52.093]  It really, truly is amazing.
[03:35:53.163 --> 03:36:00.349]  So I was covering this article right before we went to break of the number of immigrants from Muslim nations that we're going to be bringing in.
[03:36:00.810 --> 03:36:06.154]  And there's a graph, if you guys can scroll down to that graph, that shows how many they've issued over the last five years.
[03:36:06.194 --> 03:36:12.660]  You've got Muslims coming in from Afghanistan, Sudan, Syria, Indonesia, Yemen, Lebanon, Algeria, Jordan.
[03:36:13.440 --> 03:36:24.114]  Mexico, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Somalia, Egypt, Iran, Bangladesh, Iraq and Pakistan have the most along with Bangladesh and Iran.
[03:36:24.134 --> 03:36:28.460]  So we're bringing in lots of people from these countries and
[03:36:29.281 --> 03:36:31.983]  I would say most of them probably are coming here for a good life.
[03:36:32.444 --> 03:36:34.205]  And that's how it used to be.
[03:36:34.586 --> 03:36:39.410]  When we had immigration and people were immigrating to this country, they were coming here looking for a better life.
[03:36:39.630 --> 03:36:43.673]  They weren't coming here looking to tear down the United States or turn it into a different nation.
[03:36:43.994 --> 03:36:50.760]  They were coming here to be part of what was going on, which was a free market society where if you worked your butt off, you can make something of yourself.
[03:36:51.400 --> 03:36:54.762]  But now we have Cuban refugees flocking to the Texas border.
[03:36:54.803 --> 03:36:56.083]  Here's another article.
[03:36:56.784 --> 03:37:04.570]  From October 2015 to February 2016, more than 18,500 Cubans arrived at Texas Laredo Field Office of the U.S.
[03:37:04.610 --> 03:37:05.550]  Customs and Border Patrol.
[03:37:05.570 --> 03:37:08.072]  So that includes Del Rio and Brownsville.
[03:37:08.753 --> 03:37:14.237]  And if the trend continues, it will shatter last year's numbers for the same ports when a record 28,000 crossed.
[03:37:14.417 --> 03:37:16.939]  So they just keep upping the records.
[03:37:17.799 --> 03:37:19.080]  And that's just from Cuba.
[03:37:19.300 --> 03:37:26.364]  That doesn't count the other Central American, the African or the Middle Eastern countries that people are coming from.
[03:37:26.765 --> 03:37:30.727]  Now I want to go to this video of Jimmy Carter during the Iran hostage crisis.
[03:37:31.147 --> 03:37:37.451]  Well, they put a lot of sanctions on Iran and they also banned Iranians from coming into the country and asked the diplomats to leave.
[03:37:37.852 --> 03:37:39.513]  And nobody called him a racist.
[03:37:40.393 --> 03:37:41.915]  So what's the difference now?
[03:37:41.975 --> 03:37:43.297]  Why is Donald being called a racist?
[03:37:43.317 --> 03:37:52.148]  I've got video coming up of young children who have been brainwashed by their parents into believing everything they see on CNN and other mainstream media outlets.
[03:37:52.168 --> 03:37:53.930]  So let's go to that video of Jimmy Carter first.
[03:37:54.415 --> 03:37:56.277]  The President ordered four steps immediately.
[03:37:56.778 --> 03:37:58.579]  A complete break in diplomatic relations.
[03:37:58.820 --> 03:38:01.722]  Iranian diplomats must leave the United States by tomorrow midnight.
[03:38:02.303 --> 03:38:04.765]  Official sanctions prohibiting exports to Iran.
[03:38:05.146 --> 03:38:08.810]  The exporting of even food and medicine is expected to be minimal or non-existent.
[03:38:09.450 --> 03:38:16.978]  An inventory of frozen Iranian assets of over eight billion dollars in this country and steps toward using the money to pay claims of Americans against Iran.
[03:38:17.646 --> 03:38:23.427]  And a virtual shutting off of all Iranian immigration into this country by refusing new visas to Iranian citizens.
[03:38:24.047 --> 03:38:27.768]  Moreover, the President warned these four steps may be just the beginning.
[03:38:28.588 --> 03:38:32.789]  The steps I have ordered today are those that are necessary now.
[03:38:34.089 --> 03:38:43.531]  Other action may become necessary if these steps do not produce the prompt release of the hostages.
[03:38:46.152 --> 03:38:46.632]  There you go.
[03:38:47.253 --> 03:38:48.574]  Hey, let's go to a call.
[03:38:48.794 --> 03:38:51.837]  Chris in Ohio, comment on the nationwide hate for Trump.
[03:38:51.877 --> 03:38:53.018]  I don't know if it's nationwide hate.
[03:38:53.038 --> 03:38:57.041]  I think it's a very vocal minority that's being coerced into hate.
[03:38:57.061 --> 03:38:59.423]  And I've got a video showing that in a second, but go ahead.
[03:38:59.643 --> 03:39:00.203]  What do you got to say?
[03:39:01.144 --> 03:39:11.032]  Interesting is actually I know one of the guys that provoked this viral video in Cleveland where someone says something about go back to Auschwitz.
[03:39:11.052 --> 03:39:13.074]  Well, obviously someone called the guy a Nazi.
[03:39:14.161 --> 03:39:16.383]  But then that, I don't know if you saw that video or not.
[03:39:16.863 --> 03:39:17.764]  Okay, so that's one thing.
[03:39:17.784 --> 03:39:20.826]  But to me, I can't even enjoy logging on Facebook anymore.
[03:39:21.627 --> 03:39:25.230]  Because literally the whole thing is hate, hate, hate.
[03:39:25.370 --> 03:39:29.933]  And it's very... And hate of Trump is okay on Facebook.
[03:39:30.134 --> 03:39:30.354]  Right?
[03:39:30.374 --> 03:39:31.835]  You notice hate of Trump is okay.
[03:39:31.875 --> 03:39:38.040]  If you say anything else, if you have an opinion that's negative of anybody else, you're censored on Facebook.
[03:39:39.401 --> 03:39:39.601]  Right.
[03:39:41.158 --> 03:39:44.739]  You know, I mean, it's just a shame that all these people are showing their worst sides.
[03:39:44.799 --> 03:39:45.719]  And also, I'm a veteran.
[03:39:45.779 --> 03:39:52.160]  I was over there the same time as Tim, and our job was finding bombs and building fortifications.
[03:39:52.821 --> 03:39:54.841]  And yeah, I love the people.
[03:39:54.881 --> 03:39:56.441]  When they're children, they're very great people.
[03:39:57.282 --> 03:40:05.123]  But, you know, people over here have to understand, too, our military worked alongside the Iraqi Army and good Afghanistan people to fight.
[03:40:05.163 --> 03:40:05.924]  People don't even get that.
[03:40:06.644 --> 03:40:07.624]  I think as soon as you say,
[03:40:08.559 --> 03:40:09.861]  Oh, I'm against these terrorists.
[03:40:09.881 --> 03:40:10.962]  They think you're against all of them.
[03:40:10.982 --> 03:40:11.442]  That's not the case.
[03:40:12.944 --> 03:40:13.144]  Right.
[03:40:13.685 --> 03:40:27.540]  But, you know, I think the argument, though, is, you know, if people were to invade our country, say China was to invade our country, and they had taken over a large swath of it, and Americans started fighting the Chinese, we would be called terrorists and insurgents.
[03:40:27.861 --> 03:40:28.782]  You realize that, right?
[03:40:31.388 --> 03:40:36.890]  I mean, and that's, you know, because whoever is controlling the narrative is going to call you, you know, whatever you want.
[03:40:37.311 --> 03:40:43.994]  And, you know, those wars were both, I think, fought on bad terms and for bad reasons.
[03:40:45.274 --> 03:40:52.737]  We weren't on the up and up, and I don't think we were in danger of being attacked by Afghanistan or Iraq, you know, at that time, and even still to this day.
[03:40:54.278 --> 03:40:58.620]  The people that went there, the family men, the people that were sensitive to their culture,
[03:40:59.443 --> 03:41:01.724]  I mean, you can't talk about there's nobody better.
[03:41:01.784 --> 03:41:03.765]  I mean, we gave them food, hug them.
[03:41:03.785 --> 03:41:06.847]  I've got great pictures of me hugging these kids.
[03:41:07.027 --> 03:41:08.408]  People over here aren't used to deception.
[03:41:08.428 --> 03:41:09.289]  They're not used to this.
[03:41:09.369 --> 03:41:13.631]  So they think every person from the Middle East is like, you know what I mean?
[03:41:13.651 --> 03:41:15.872]  They're all mystical or something.
[03:41:15.912 --> 03:41:18.073]  It's like, no, man, they got their psychos, too.
[03:41:18.314 --> 03:41:19.674]  Yeah, they're regular people.
[03:41:19.714 --> 03:41:20.895]  Most of them are regular people.
[03:41:20.915 --> 03:41:22.676]  To fight them.
[03:41:22.696 --> 03:41:24.237]  I guess what I'm saying is people here don't get
[03:41:24.722 --> 03:41:27.045]  I have a higher love because I've been on my knees for these people.
[03:41:27.065 --> 03:41:28.026]  I've uplifted these people.
[03:41:28.307 --> 03:41:32.291]  And they're going to tell me, oh, you know, and put female American veterans at risk?
[03:41:32.372 --> 03:41:34.214]  I mean, this is going by the model of Europe.
[03:41:35.155 --> 03:41:36.777]  You know, that also bothers me.
[03:41:37.257 --> 03:41:38.519]  I mean, we have female veterans here.
[03:41:38.639 --> 03:41:40.081]  They're indiscriminately attacking women.
[03:41:40.541 --> 03:41:41.663]  This is ridiculous.
[03:41:41.946 --> 03:41:43.067]  Yeah, totally agree.
[03:41:43.087 --> 03:41:43.667]  Thanks for the call.
[03:41:43.987 --> 03:41:45.188]  Hey, let's go down to this video.
[03:41:45.248 --> 03:41:47.069]  It's called on video brainwashed children.
[03:41:47.549 --> 03:41:53.652]  If you saw there's a video yesterday we put up called liberals children protest Trump.
[03:41:53.672 --> 03:42:02.957]  I forget the exact name of it, but this David Knight's wife went up and actually interviewed some of these kids and then we got permission from their parents to post this video, but
[03:42:04.318 --> 03:42:09.583]  They're gonna, you're gonna see the same talking points that you see from the people, the adults at these protests.
[03:42:09.643 --> 03:42:13.407]  He's racist, he hates Muslims, he wants to deport Muslims.
[03:42:13.507 --> 03:42:15.188]  And he never said he wants to deport Muslims.
[03:42:15.689 --> 03:42:20.473]  He said, we need to vet people coming in, we need to close our borders until we can vet people properly.
[03:42:20.654 --> 03:42:22.195]  But let's go to this video right now.
[03:42:22.255 --> 03:42:24.057]  Caught on video, brainwashed children.
[03:42:33.826 --> 03:42:35.447]  What is he done to the Jews?
[03:42:44.568 --> 03:42:52.954]  And he just says mean things to a reporter like, excuse me, your breath, things like that.
[03:42:53.094 --> 03:42:53.754]  It's just mean.
[03:42:54.154 --> 03:42:55.976]  I don't like it.
[03:42:56.016 --> 03:42:57.557]  Who do you like?
[03:42:57.617 --> 03:42:59.858]  Hillary Clinton and John Kasich.
[03:42:59.998 --> 03:43:01.919]  Those are my favorites.
[03:43:02.000 --> 03:43:03.561]  Are you in public school?
[03:43:03.741 --> 03:43:04.141]  Uh, what?
[03:43:04.501 --> 03:43:07.183]  Do you go to public school?
[03:43:07.263 --> 03:43:09.044]  Yeah, it's spring break.
[03:43:09.064 --> 03:43:09.885]  We go to FCPS.
[03:43:10.905 --> 03:43:18.867]  Did you say most of your classmates are for Hillary or for Donald Trump?
[03:43:18.927 --> 03:43:19.948]  Yeah, no.
[03:43:21.548 --> 03:43:23.669]  I think all of my classmates hate Trump.
[03:43:23.729 --> 03:43:26.369]  They like Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.
[03:43:26.389 --> 03:43:28.490]  Why do you think that is?
[03:43:28.690 --> 03:43:30.510]  Because Trump's crazy.
[03:43:33.231 --> 03:43:34.772]  Is that what you learned at school?
[03:43:34.872 --> 03:43:35.533]  What?
[03:43:35.633 --> 03:43:38.135]  No, you got it all wrong.
[03:43:38.215 --> 03:43:40.136]  Your mom told you.
[03:43:40.256 --> 03:43:42.337]  And it was awesome.
[03:43:42.618 --> 03:43:43.598]  I loved it.
[03:43:43.778 --> 03:43:54.666]  I like, it's my first chance to protest against him and I really want to protest loud so everyone can hear my message.
[03:43:54.766 --> 03:43:56.908]  Okay, have you ever done any protests before?
[03:43:56.968 --> 03:43:57.608]  No, never.
[03:43:57.728 --> 03:43:58.389]  First time, huh?
[03:43:58.469 --> 03:43:58.929]  Yeah.
[03:43:59.109 --> 03:44:00.370]  Are you having fun?
[03:44:00.850 --> 03:44:02.532]  Yeah, I'm having a ton.
[03:44:03.232 --> 03:44:04.393]  Yeah, we look cute.
[03:44:04.433 --> 03:44:05.953]  This is my Trump face.
[03:44:06.033 --> 03:44:07.234]  NEVER TRUMP!
[03:44:07.254 --> 03:44:07.874]  NEVER TRUMP!
[03:44:07.934 --> 03:44:08.834]  NEVER TRUMP!
[03:44:08.894 --> 03:44:09.975]  NEVER TRUMP!
[03:44:10.155 --> 03:44:10.975]  NEVER TRUMP!
[03:44:10.995 --> 03:44:11.635]  NEVER TRUMP!
[03:44:12.276 --> 03:44:19.418]  So do you guys watch the news or?
[03:44:19.939 --> 03:44:21.619]  Yeah, we do.
[03:44:21.659 --> 03:44:22.800]  Yes, we watch a lot.
[03:44:22.820 --> 03:44:25.621]  Where do you get your names from?
[03:44:25.701 --> 03:44:26.701]  Uh, I thought you guys did.
[03:44:26.761 --> 03:44:28.262]  No, we do CNN.
[03:44:28.302 --> 03:44:28.482]  CNN?
[03:44:32.831 --> 03:44:33.571]  There it is.
[03:44:33.691 --> 03:44:33.991]  CNN.
[03:44:34.211 --> 03:44:35.592]  Do you agree with your parents?
[03:44:35.632 --> 03:44:36.712]  Their parents watch CNN.
[03:44:36.752 --> 03:44:38.252]  Their parents are telling them what to say.
[03:44:38.772 --> 03:44:43.494]  And you said your top choices for 2016 are Hillary Clinton and John Kasich?
[03:44:43.534 --> 03:44:43.654]  Yes.
[03:44:43.674 --> 03:44:44.694]  Those are the two.
[03:44:44.714 --> 03:44:44.954]  Alright.
[03:44:44.974 --> 03:44:49.895]  Well, you guys are very sophisticated young ones to have a political opinion.
[03:44:50.075 --> 03:44:50.455]  Wow.
[03:44:50.815 --> 03:44:52.036]  Alright.
[03:44:52.616 --> 03:44:54.216]  You can watch the rest of that video.
[03:44:54.276 --> 03:44:55.396]  Go to Infowars.com.
[03:44:55.416 --> 03:44:56.657]  Caught on video brainwashed children.
[03:44:56.677 --> 03:44:59.777]  There's a couple videos there of the kids protesting.
[03:45:00.458 --> 03:45:00.938]  You know, on
[03:45:02.663 --> 03:45:07.786]  On a whole level, I don't see a problem with bringing kids to a protest, either for or against Trump.
[03:45:07.826 --> 03:45:09.867]  I mean, you're teaching kids to get active.
[03:45:10.147 --> 03:45:15.931]  I think when you're telling kids the same, you're propagating the same lies that you see on the mainstream media, you're doing your kids a disservice.
[03:45:16.531 --> 03:45:17.592]  But that's just my opinion.
[03:45:18.032 --> 03:45:22.995]  Let's talk to Courtney in FEMA Region 6, wants to talk about the double standard, everyone hating on Trump.
[03:45:23.015 --> 03:45:23.715]  Go ahead, Courtney.
[03:45:24.796 --> 03:45:27.457]  Hi, I just wanted to call and comment.
[03:45:27.557 --> 03:45:31.800]  And like one of the guys was saying earlier that was talking about going on Facebook,
[03:45:32.832 --> 03:45:36.174]  It actually kind of changed my comment that I'm going to say.
[03:45:36.914 --> 03:45:47.378]  I actually was personally attacked on Facebook for posting a supportive Donald Trump post.
[03:45:47.658 --> 03:45:51.000]  My husband served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[03:45:53.361 --> 03:45:54.501]  He has a Purple Heart.
[03:45:55.301 --> 03:45:58.403]  He is a disabled veteran from the Army.
[03:46:02.367 --> 03:46:07.952]  He personally, this friend that I thought I had, he personally attacked me.
[03:46:07.972 --> 03:46:19.241]  He said that my husband was not a hero, my husband was a coward, and some words that I can't say on air, because like Alex says, it's a family show.
[03:46:19.261 --> 03:46:19.722]  Right.
[03:46:21.801 --> 03:46:25.143]  And it's gotten to be just not fun anymore.
[03:46:25.183 --> 03:46:30.987]  Like, Facebook has turned into this war zone.
[03:46:31.327 --> 03:46:33.108]  It's fulfilling its mission.
[03:46:33.348 --> 03:46:41.634]  It's fulfilling its mission to tell us how to think, what to say, and if you say something wrong, the henpeckers will come and tell you that you're wrong.
[03:46:41.854 --> 03:46:44.736]  So you were physically attacked by someone or just attacked through Facebook?
[03:46:45.516 --> 03:46:48.378]  I was attacked through Facebook from a friend that I had.
[03:46:49.319 --> 03:46:50.220]  I don't know.
[03:47:09.275 --> 03:47:09.755]  Guess what?
[03:47:09.795 --> 03:47:15.240]  When the terrorists who are attacking people like they attacked the people in Brussels today, guess what?
[03:47:15.300 --> 03:47:22.505]  At the end of the day, we're all going to be Americans, and we're all going to need to take a stand together against these people who want to hurt us.
[03:47:23.146 --> 03:47:32.393]  And when you have that out there, you have to realize that, and you have to get grounded and stop this just knifing back and forth at each other.
[03:47:32.753 --> 03:47:35.455]  And hearing those kids breaks my heart.
[03:47:36.292 --> 03:47:39.798]  It just breaks my heart because that's our future.
[03:47:40.439 --> 03:47:45.909]  And we're turning our kids into snipey, aggressive.
[03:47:45.969 --> 03:47:48.654]  I mean, what little kid uses the term racist?
[03:47:48.999 --> 03:47:59.267]  And they're being trained, they're being trained at a young age now to be little henpeckers and to find people who are not holding the party line and correct them.
[03:47:59.928 --> 03:48:05.392]  And that is exactly what is going on and regurgitating mainstream media talking points.
[03:48:05.472 --> 03:48:06.133]  It's disgusting.
[03:48:06.793 --> 03:48:08.654]  First of all, I have the greatest respect for Alex.
[03:48:08.674 --> 03:48:09.274]  In my book, he's the best.
[03:48:09.294 --> 03:48:09.934]  He's a general.
[03:48:36.687 --> 03:48:37.007]  I agree.
[03:48:37.808 --> 03:48:42.090]  And I know that he isn't there to speak for himself, but I do want to say this.
[03:48:43.391 --> 03:48:52.197]  You know, he's shouting from the mountaintops, and I say this with due respect to him because I cannot tell you how I like the guy.
[03:48:52.277 --> 03:48:56.659]  I mean, I really can't say enough good about him and what he's done.
[03:48:57.280 --> 03:49:00.882]  But he shouts from the mountaintops about the Bin Laden raid.
[03:49:01.562 --> 03:49:05.585]  Then when he gets a mercenary, and I believe this guy is a mercenary,
[03:49:06.397 --> 03:49:07.757]  I don't understand that.
[03:49:36.485 --> 03:49:37.286]  I don't think so.
[03:49:48.484 --> 03:49:51.125]  I mean, were there any mercenaries in the Second World War?
[03:49:51.165 --> 03:49:52.166]  No, we were there to win it.
[03:49:52.246 --> 03:49:53.867]  I don't think we were there to win Vietnam.
[03:49:54.047 --> 03:49:55.428]  I don't think we were there to win Korea.
[03:49:55.748 --> 03:50:04.272]  You know, I think those guys were just brought in to show, to create a scene and, you know, make profits for the military-industrial complex.
[03:50:04.312 --> 03:50:06.734]  I think that's what is going on in the background.
[03:50:07.034 --> 03:50:08.655]  And I think a lot of these guys don't know that.
[03:50:09.515 --> 03:50:10.816]  They're not at that level.
[03:50:11.897 --> 03:50:17.880]  They're not seeing the benefits of these contracts and these multi-year, no-bid contracts.
[03:50:17.900 --> 03:50:23.863]  A lot of the guys on the ground, like the lady who just called Courtney her husband, he probably is a great guy.
[03:50:24.303 --> 03:50:27.865]  He didn't know what was going on and how these things are fought and why they're fought.
[03:50:28.446 --> 03:50:35.470]  He's just doing his duty because he's told that being a soldier is following orders and going to do into these combat zones.
[03:50:36.853 --> 03:50:38.814]  But the only thing I wanted to say was this.
[03:50:39.374 --> 03:50:44.116]  I do not mean to be disrespectful to any of the military.
[03:50:44.196 --> 03:50:46.457]  Because again, I'm certainly for them.
[03:50:46.597 --> 03:50:48.038]  I was in the military myself.
[03:50:48.678 --> 03:50:50.479]  I wouldn't be disrespectful towards them.
[03:50:50.999 --> 03:50:52.880]  But they're being treated like mercenaries.
[03:50:52.940 --> 03:50:55.621]  Now these fellows... I'll let you finish up after the break.
[03:50:55.641 --> 03:50:56.482]  We're going to break right now.
[03:50:56.522 --> 03:50:58.402]  We'll be right back with one more segment of the 4th Hour.
[03:50:58.442 --> 03:51:03.625]  This is Rob Due for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News and PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:51:23.957 --> 03:51:24.557]  That's easy.
[03:51:24.798 --> 03:51:26.519]  There's more money in treating symptoms.

[03:52:33.574 --> 03:52:42.200]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[03:52:42.440 --> 03:52:49.345]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigyrex herbal processing technique.

[03:53:06.446 --> 03:53:13.308]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[03:53:13.468 --> 03:53:17.909]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.

[03:54:30.060 --> 03:54:31.260]  We love our Prison Planet members.
[03:54:31.300 --> 03:54:35.322]  They allow, you know, everything here to be bought, sending our reporters out on missions.
[03:54:36.002 --> 03:54:41.845]  We've got the Knight family driving around, I think they're in Williamsburg right now, heading back to Austin.
[03:54:42.105 --> 03:54:44.046]  Gary, I'm gonna let you finish up, give you about a minute.
[03:54:44.386 --> 03:54:46.787]  I understand that completely and believe me, I do not mean any disrespect.
[03:55:07.316 --> 03:55:07.896]  We're good to go.
[03:55:30.266 --> 03:55:31.106]  What does that mean?
[03:55:31.166 --> 03:55:33.787]  That means exactly what happened in Oregon.
[03:55:33.827 --> 03:55:34.687]  That's what that means.
[03:55:35.267 --> 03:55:36.928]  Shoot first, ask questions later.
[03:55:36.948 --> 03:55:40.289]  I don't know who those guys were that killed LaVoy.
[03:55:41.629 --> 03:55:43.070]  And we still don't have their names.
[03:55:43.210 --> 03:55:43.790]  And we should.
[03:55:44.130 --> 03:55:45.050]  We should have their names.
[03:55:45.891 --> 03:55:49.211]  But I don't know who they were, whether they were ex-military or what.
[03:55:49.632 --> 03:55:57.874]  But if they're recruiting ex-military into the FBI or any other law enforcement operation,
[03:55:58.405 --> 03:56:06.310]  That goes right along with what Alex always says, and they're militarizing, purposely militarizing the police forces in this country.
[03:56:07.037 --> 03:56:10.620]  Well, that's what happens to a lot of local police departments.
[03:56:10.640 --> 03:56:11.941]  They hire ex-military.
[03:56:12.981 --> 03:56:14.222]  One, the guys know how to shoot a weapon.
[03:56:14.262 --> 03:56:15.423]  Two, they know how to follow orders.
[03:56:15.483 --> 03:56:26.731]  Three, they're pretty physical, but they're in areas where their life was under constant threat, and then you still have that, I think, hanging over on them when they're coming back.
[03:56:26.891 --> 03:56:28.352]  They're thinking, you know...
[03:56:29.403 --> 03:56:31.246]  Everybody's still, who knows what they're thinking.
[03:56:31.987 --> 03:56:36.853]  You know, Joe Biggs is back from military and he's a pretty stable guy.
[03:56:36.874 --> 03:56:38.135]  Although he does like to...
[03:56:40.049 --> 03:56:41.730]  Have a drink of Fireball every now and then.
[03:56:41.750 --> 03:56:46.893]  But he's a great guy and he's been in the thick of it in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[03:56:46.973 --> 03:56:48.675]  So, hey Gary, thanks for calling.
[03:56:48.815 --> 03:56:50.656]  I agree with you on a lot of those points.
[03:56:51.296 --> 03:56:52.977]  I want to play just a part of a video.
[03:56:53.017 --> 03:57:00.402]  Yesterday, David Knight was in front of the AIPAC conference and he was going up to talk to a guy with a Trump is a Nazi sign.
[03:57:00.462 --> 03:57:05.786]  And lo and behold, who pops up out of the woodwork from under his pot of gold but Webster Tarpley.
[03:57:05.866 --> 03:57:09.148]  So let's play that video until we, I guess, end the show.
[03:57:10.382 --> 03:57:13.503]  We're at a point, we're at a historical tipping point, buddy.
[03:57:13.743 --> 03:57:15.823]  We gotta tell it like it is.
[03:57:15.863 --> 03:57:17.504]  So you think Trump is a Nazi?
[03:57:17.604 --> 03:57:18.764]  You think this gets your message?
[03:57:18.824 --> 03:57:19.224]  You do?
[03:57:19.384 --> 03:57:19.744]  You do?
[03:57:19.904 --> 03:57:20.224]  Okay.
[03:57:20.264 --> 03:57:20.745]  He's a Nazi.
[03:57:20.805 --> 03:57:22.685]  He has violence in his rallies.
[03:57:22.705 --> 03:57:28.347]  You compare him to the Hitler of 1929, you compare him to the Mussolini of 1920.
[03:57:28.747 --> 03:57:30.187]  You don't think that's an overstatement?
[03:57:30.367 --> 03:57:30.527]  No.
[03:57:30.787 --> 03:57:32.028]  I'm a historian.
[03:57:32.508 --> 03:57:33.728]  I know what I'm talking about.
[03:57:34.048 --> 03:57:35.129]  There are multiple points.
[03:57:35.509 --> 03:57:36.669]  And you're Webster Tarpley, right?
[03:57:36.709 --> 03:57:37.690]  Webster Tarpley, that's it.
[03:57:38.190 --> 03:57:39.531]  We've got Webster Tarpley here.
[03:57:39.831 --> 03:57:42.212]  And Webster Tarpley thinks that Donald Trump is a Nazi.
[03:57:42.272 --> 03:57:43.512]  Absolutely a Nazi.
[03:57:44.092 --> 03:57:53.496]  And I'm appalled to see libertarians, who are supposed to be the opposite of authoritarian, totalitarian, all trooping like lemmings.
[03:57:54.156 --> 03:57:55.877]  Do you understand what's going on with globalism?
[03:57:55.957 --> 03:57:56.917]  Do you see the open borders?
[03:58:16.044 --> 03:58:16.845]  Why is he a Nazi?
[03:58:47.046 --> 03:58:47.567]  That's it.
[03:58:47.607 --> 03:58:51.172]  You can watch the rest on YouTube or on InfoWars.com.
[03:58:51.192 --> 03:58:51.934]  Thanks for watching.
[03:58:51.954 --> 03:58:54.958]  This has been Rob Due with the 4th Hour, InfoWars.com.
