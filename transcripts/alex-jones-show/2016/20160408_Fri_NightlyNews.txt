[00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:20.985]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:22.986]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.047]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:24.127 --> 00:00:25.407]  It is Friday, April 8, 2016.
[00:00:27.428 --> 00:00:28.869]  Here's a quick look at what's coming up.
[00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:41.634]  Tonight, even though NBC scrapped a story about Bill Clinton's rape accuser, people know the issue is not infidelity, but rape and sexual assault.
[00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:44.002]  I was a Democrat.
[00:00:44.102 --> 00:00:46.728]  I became a Republican because of this.
[00:00:46.768 --> 00:00:50.056]  The hypocrisy of so-called women that fight for women.
[00:00:50.768 --> 00:00:56.390]  Hillary lashes out at a woman who questions Hillary's support of sexual misconduct against women.
[00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.530]  Well, I'm going to call on people.
[00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:00.031]  Wait a minute.
[00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:03.852]  I'm not going to take your question because other people have been... Yes.
[00:01:04.172 --> 00:01:12.255]  And we talked to a student organizer in support of Trump who felt the burn of censorship and intimidation from social justice warriors.
[00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:16.716]  And there were violent Antifa members who tried... One of them tried to assault my friend.
[00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:20.814]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:12.227 --> 00:03:21.696]  Imagine for a moment that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton become the presidential nominees for the 2016 election.
[00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:32.225]  And Americans all across the country are getting ready to finally watch the much-anticipated debate between Trump and Hillary.
[00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:36.507]  No doubt there would be a captive audience nationwide.
[00:03:36.527 --> 00:03:38.829]  I mean, the ratings would be phenomenal.
[00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:42.551]  And it would promise to be a true blue spectacle.
[00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:47.354]  A debate like no other ever before seen in American politics.
[00:03:48.054 --> 00:03:48.635]  But guess what?
[00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:50.256]  It's not going to happen.
[00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:51.678]  And I'm going to tell you why.
[00:03:52.138 --> 00:04:03.091]  First of all, Hillary supporters, they say that she's ready and she's not afraid to get in the ring with anybody because by now, well, they say, you know, she's seen it all.
[00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:06.335]  Hillary Clinton's been tried and tested against
[00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:18.122]  All the attacks that can be thrown at her so she's ready to take on anyone, especially Donald Trump in a nationwide presidential debate on live TV.
[00:04:18.402 --> 00:04:25.026]  And they have no doubt in their minds that Hillary would dominate Trump anywhere, anytime.
[00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:39.375]  Well, at least that's what they'd like you to believe, but in reality, a Trump-Hillary matchup would be a total disaster, not only for Hillary Clinton, but for the entire establishment.
[00:04:39.575 --> 00:04:43.457]  And that's why I don't think we will ever see a debate between them.
[00:04:43.997 --> 00:04:50.201]  I hope I'm wrong, but I just don't think the global elite and the private banking cartels are going to let it happen.
[00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:51.142]  And here's why.
[00:04:51.622 --> 00:04:52.423]  Donald Trump
[00:04:53.143 --> 00:04:56.586]  Will expose her for the fraud that she is.
[00:04:57.047 --> 00:05:05.435]  And he will also reveal to the nation that apparently her husband, former President Bill Clinton, is a serial rapist.
[00:05:05.956 --> 00:05:16.386]  And Hillary, as his wife, the former First Lady and Secretary of State, has worked behind the scenes to silence the victims.
[00:05:17.355 --> 00:05:25.581]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women, no, Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:32.526]  And for those of you out there who think that this is impossible, that this is just another crazy conspiracy theory, well let me ask you this.
[00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:38.351]  What did you think when you first found out about the Bill Cosby rape allegations?
[00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:39.411]  Were you surprised?
[00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:40.891]  Mr. Huxtable?
[00:05:41.612 --> 00:05:42.472]  And what about O.J.
[00:05:42.532 --> 00:05:44.112]  Simpson when he killed his wife?
[00:05:44.773 --> 00:05:46.653]  The nation was in total shock.
[00:05:46.793 --> 00:05:48.194]  I mean, nobody saw that coming.
[00:05:48.954 --> 00:05:52.677]  And personally, as a child, I mean, OJ was one of my childhood heroes.
[00:05:53.358 --> 00:05:58.242]  I watched him play football, I had his posters, I had his football cards, you know, I watched his movies.
[00:05:58.523 --> 00:06:00.724]  He was the all-American hero.
[00:06:01.065 --> 00:06:08.671]  But I'm not in denial, I've seen the evidence, and there's no doubt in my mind that OJ is a cold-blooded killer.
[00:06:09.432 --> 00:06:20.860]  And I think when more and more people see the evidence that's already out there, you will discover the truth behind Bill and Hillary Clinton, because apparently, I mean, she's just as guilty as he is.
[00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:25.243]  Bill is the rapist and Hillary is the enforcer.
[00:06:27.765 --> 00:06:33.329]  He starts to bite on my top lip and I try to pull away from him.
[00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:39.370]  And then he forces me down on the bed.
[00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.452]  And I just was very frightened.
[00:06:46.213 --> 00:06:49.014]  And I tried to get away from him and I told him no.
[00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:53.437]  I didn't want this to happen.
[00:06:56.451 --> 00:06:58.874]  Hillary's the one in charge of the cover-ups.
[00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:04.519]  And they say she even created a Who's Next task force.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:13.449]  And this goes all the way back to when Bill was the governor of Arkansas because it was apparent to them by that time that he couldn't be stopped.
[00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:18.552]  And this was going to keep occurring, and this was going to happen over and over again.
[00:07:18.913 --> 00:07:29.841]  And sure enough, it surely did, because many, many other victims were to follow, including women that he sexually assaulted right there in the Oval Office.
[00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:33.283]  And this goes way beyond Monica Lewinsky.
[00:07:33.423 --> 00:07:34.604]  No, this goes beyond that.
[00:07:34.924 --> 00:07:36.185]  These women said no.
[00:07:37.406 --> 00:08:00.792]  But they were allegedly assaulted, sometimes brutally, by Bill Clinton, who would, according to the allegations, force himself upon them, and if they were too loud, screaming for help, or if they managed to get away from his grasp, or his trademark lip-biting, he would pleasure himself in front of them until he was pervertly satisfied.
[00:08:02.574 --> 00:08:04.654]  That's the allegations, for starters.
[00:08:05.435 --> 00:08:07.755]  Believe it or not, that's only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:08:07.795 --> 00:08:10.196]  I mean, it gets crazier the more you look into it.
[00:08:10.476 --> 00:08:21.578]  And I'll probably do a much more extensive report on this in the future, but for now, I hope I at least pique your interest and convince you that it's worth, trust me, ladies and gentlemen, it is worth looking into.
[00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:27.740]  And if you don't believe it, then go out there and investigate it for yourself and prove these women wrong.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:34.983]  Now one thing's for sure, the Clinton rape allegations, it's a total forbidden subject on the mainstream media.
[00:08:35.863 --> 00:08:38.524]  And especially now during the presidential campaign.
[00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:45.927]  And if anybody brings it up, they will be cut off and more than likely not ever be invited back on the show again.
[00:08:46.846 --> 00:08:50.187]  Bringing up Clinton's women who say they were intimidated by Hillary.
[00:08:50.228 --> 00:08:54.669]  Having them come forward and speak a litany of issues that you can't even imagine.
[00:08:54.689 --> 00:08:58.131]  I'm thinking that might not be a winning argument for Donald Trump right at this moment.
[00:08:58.331 --> 00:09:01.532]  That woman now says, Hillary ruined my life.
[00:09:02.213 --> 00:09:03.173]  What's wrong?
[00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:04.694]  I'm going to leave it there.
[00:09:04.814 --> 00:09:07.095]  I'm going to leave it there.
[00:09:08.055 --> 00:09:09.876]  God forbid that I should defend Hillary Clinton.
[00:09:10.276 --> 00:09:12.037]  She was appointed to represent somebody.
[00:09:12.417 --> 00:09:13.538]  So she's got to do her job.
[00:09:13.558 --> 00:09:14.478]  I'm going to leave it there.
[00:09:14.498 --> 00:09:14.898]  Goodbye.
[00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:15.899]  Thanks for joining me.
[00:09:16.618 --> 00:09:30.124]  But sometimes when a talking head on television isn't there to regulate the conversation, like during a live debate, or in this case, during a town hall meeting, well Hillary Clinton is left defenseless.
[00:09:30.144 --> 00:09:40.748]  ...say that all rape victims should be believed, but would you say that about Johnny Tabroderick, Kathleen Wiley, and or Paula Jones?
[00:09:41.068 --> 00:09:41.969]  Should we believe them as well?
[00:09:43.357 --> 00:09:49.461]  Well, I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.
[00:09:54.745 --> 00:09:55.686]  Okay, let me see.
[00:09:56.286 --> 00:09:58.488]  Right back there, this man right there.
[00:10:00.129 --> 00:10:01.090]  Here we go, right there.
[00:10:03.532 --> 00:10:06.173]  You are very rude and I'm not going to ever call on you.
[00:10:06.294 --> 00:10:06.634]  Thank you.
[00:10:13.887 --> 00:10:14.934]  Why does this matter to you?
[00:10:14.974 --> 00:10:16.826]  Because I'm a rape survivor myself.
[00:10:17.776 --> 00:10:21.938]  You see, this is what Hillary Clinton and the establishment are afraid of.
[00:10:22.418 --> 00:10:25.060]  Donald Trump doesn't play by the same rules.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.841]  I mean, he is truly an anti-establishment candidate.
[00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:45.870]  And during a live debate, Trump will more than likely bring up this forbidden topic and embarrass the Clintons because it's obvious by now that no one else in the Republican Party has the stomach or the huevos to make this the issue
[00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:47.630]  It deserves to be.
[00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:53.492]  The establishment media and the Clintons, they've spent decades covering all of this up.
[00:10:54.232 --> 00:11:02.135]  And I'm sure that they're going to do everything they can to prevent Donald Trump from becoming the Republican nominee.
[00:11:02.975 --> 00:11:05.757]  And I think we all need to pray for Donald Trump right now.
[00:11:05.977 --> 00:11:08.359]  I think he is in real danger.
[00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:29.012]  And it's well known that the enemies of the Clintons, well, they have a bad habit of getting involved in mysterious, fatal accidents, just like those brave individuals who've gone up against the establishment over the years, who have been suddenly and dramatically silenced.
[00:11:29.973 --> 00:11:32.515]  And I hope and I pray that this never happens.
[00:11:33.616 --> 00:11:41.370]  But I wouldn't be surprised if Donald Trump's last words were, my thanks to all of you and now it's on to Chicago and let's win there.
[00:11:53.831 --> 00:12:00.474]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight and we're going to be talking to the lawyer of the DC Madam, Debra Jean Palfrey.
[00:12:00.514 --> 00:12:05.456]  Now she was supposedly had committed suicide about 10 years ago.
[00:12:07.137 --> 00:12:13.940]  She was a DC Madam who had a lot of information and phone numbers on powerful people in Washington.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.701]  Politicians, staff members, many others.
[00:12:17.421 --> 00:12:18.922]  Who could lose their careers?
[00:12:19.964 --> 00:12:26.569]  And we had a senator, Vitter, who did lose his career once his name was discovered in the lists.
[00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.011]  Now, it's been some time.
[00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:34.076]  We want to talk to the lawyer because this has resurfaced after the stories from the National Enquirer.
[00:12:34.946 --> 00:12:40.933]  Talking about how Ted Cruz had had accusing him alleging that he had had affairs with multiple women.
[00:12:41.453 --> 00:12:50.463]  There were also prior to the National Enquirer story going back several weeks I think to the beginning of March was when the Marco Rubio camp was
[00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:54.910]  Putting a story around about Ted Cruz and former liaisons.
[00:12:54.930 --> 00:13:03.134]  There was also a release from Anonymous saying that they had information about Ted Cruz and situations that he had been involved in.
[00:13:03.434 --> 00:13:08.197]  Then calling on him to quit the campaign or they would release this information.
[00:13:08.557 --> 00:13:11.759]  Now we have the lawyer, the former lawyer of the DC Madam.
[00:13:13.058 --> 00:13:18.063]  And he says he has a lot of records that he believes are relevant to the current election campaign.
[00:13:18.103 --> 00:13:23.628]  He believes that time is of the essence, that the population, the voting population needs to see this information.
[00:13:24.609 --> 00:13:36.901]  And our information from him says that he is in sole possession of over 2,500 emails from and to Jean Palfrey, and the only one with full knowledge of what transpired during those last 20 months of her life.
[00:13:37.461 --> 00:13:42.896]  It was compelled by her express direction to him to tell her story in the event of her death.
[00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:45.982]  He's been practicing law for over 25 years.
[00:13:46.042 --> 00:13:47.543]  Most recently, he's engaged the U.S.
[00:13:47.563 --> 00:13:59.209]  Supreme Court in a series of lawsuits challenging that court's assertion of discretionary jurisdiction and personal immunity from suits alleging violation of federal statutes and the disposition of cases before them.
[00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.811]  This is Montgomery Blair Sibley.
[00:14:01.851 --> 00:14:05.333]  His website is montgomeryblairsibley.com.
[00:14:05.933 --> 00:14:07.414]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Sibley.
[00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:11.748]  David, what a pleasure and indeed an honor to be on your show today.
[00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:13.889]  I really appreciate the opportunity.
[00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:20.732]  Well, I appreciate you putting this information out there, and we want to get an idea of exactly what you have.
[00:14:20.952 --> 00:14:22.672]  You've been under a gag order for some time.
[00:14:22.712 --> 00:14:27.514]  This is all nine, ten years old that this information has been around.
[00:14:27.594 --> 00:14:29.435]  Tell us about the gag order.
[00:14:29.475 --> 00:14:31.796]  Tell us what you can about the information that you have.
[00:14:33.216 --> 00:14:34.557]  Well, I'll start with the gag order.
[00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:36.497]  That was entered back in May of 2007.
[00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:43.035]  It was to prevent me from releasing any telephone numbers of the DC Madam.
[00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:55.769]  It was partially modified to let me release telephone numbers alone, which we did, and that's how, through the crowdsource, we identified various people of prominence.
[00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:59.954]  Dan Moldea particularly identified Senator Vitter as one of the more prominent people on the list.
[00:15:01.432 --> 00:15:03.213]  Subsequent orders were entered in the case.
[00:15:03.734 --> 00:15:08.558]  Oral orders, which were never reduced to writing, never appear on the docket, were entered in the case.
[00:15:09.058 --> 00:15:19.888]  And the sum and substance of it all is, I understand and believe I'm operating on order not to release the names of the escorts or the clients of the escort service as of this day.
[00:15:20.689 --> 00:15:23.531]  Okay, now you appealed to the U.S.
[00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:25.613]  Supreme Court to release this gag order.
[00:15:25.653 --> 00:15:26.634]  Tell us what happened with that.
[00:15:27.714 --> 00:15:30.235]  Well, let me back up if I could, David, just a bit more.
[00:15:30.375 --> 00:15:38.539]  It was in January that, for other reasons, I was looking at these records and believed they became irrelevant to the presidential election cycle we're in.
[00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:48.684]  So I first went to the court that issued the orders, gagging me, if you will, restraining me, and they refused to let me file a request to modify the orders.
[00:15:49.925 --> 00:15:52.606]  As a result, I went to the appellate court in D.C.
[00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:59.440]  And challenge that refusal of the right to even file the request to modify the restraining orders.
[00:16:00.141 --> 00:16:13.009]  After two weeks of waiting and hearing no response, and I'll just note it's now been 30 days and I still have had no response from the Circuit Court of Appeal, I then went to Chief Justice Roberts of the U.S.
[00:16:13.029 --> 00:16:16.532]  Supreme Court requesting his intervention in this matter.
[00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:27.126]  And of course, many of us are concerned about Justice Roberts himself having written both the concurring and dissenting opinions on Obamacare.
[00:16:27.646 --> 00:16:28.607]  Highly unusual.
[00:16:28.747 --> 00:16:37.975]  Many of us at the time believed that he perhaps had been blackmailed for whatever reason, we have no idea, but it was very, very unusual and of course
[00:16:38.675 --> 00:16:47.601]  The idea that the federal government can force people to buy something in the marketplace is something that none of us could find in the Constitution.
[00:16:47.961 --> 00:16:53.985]  And clearly, Justice Roberts couldn't find it either, so he wrote both the dissenting and the concurring opinion.
[00:16:54.445 --> 00:17:01.209]  Highly irregular, and now we have learned that both he and Ginsburg have been the subject of
[00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:04.492]  Phone taps and that sort of thing from the government.
[00:17:04.532 --> 00:17:10.375]  So that is something that we all need to worry about, and it is an issue when we're looking at political candidates, because they can be blackmailed.
[00:17:10.395 --> 00:17:20.219]  Because you have situations, as the National Enquirer has done in the past, exposing moral situations with Gary Hart, with John Edwards, that ended their careers.
[00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:25.602]  Because these people can be blackmailed, but it also breaks faith with their image with the public.
[00:17:26.562 --> 00:17:27.463]  Tell us what's in these
[00:17:28.699 --> 00:17:32.423]  Uh, and these phone records that we've not previously seen, the ones that you're trying to get released.
[00:17:33.645 --> 00:17:35.787]  Well, here's the challenge technologically.
[00:17:36.308 --> 00:17:47.821]  David, you have a cell phone, telephone number, and that number belongs to you, and you know it, and anyone you give it to knows it, and of course the phone company, let's say it's AT&T, knows it, knows your name, your address.
[00:17:48.889 --> 00:17:54.551]  But nobody else can find that number because there is no white pages for cell phone telephone numbers.
[00:17:55.271 --> 00:18:01.354]  So while we were able to identify some of the numbers in the records, a large number of the numbers we couldn't identify.
[00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:12.318]  So I issued secret subpoenas, that is unknown to the government, to the major telephone companies asking them whose telephone numbers these are.
[00:18:12.358 --> 00:18:15.519]  And I gave them a list of about 6,000 telephone numbers.
[00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:23.164]  Those subpoenas went to Verizon Wireless, Alltel, AT&T, T-Mobile, and some others.
[00:18:24.045 --> 00:18:39.259]  And as a result from Verizon Wireless, God bless them, they responded and gave me a list of 815 individuals and companies that had numbers in the telephone records of the escort service.
[00:18:40.598 --> 00:18:42.319]  Okay, so you're able to reverse those out.
[00:18:43.479 --> 00:18:48.782]  Yes, it's reverse engineering of the identities of the escorts and the customers of the escort service.
[00:19:02.067 --> 00:19:05.769]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very, very carefully.
[00:19:06.533 --> 00:19:14.485]  Because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many, many people around me.
[00:19:15.026 --> 00:19:21.455]  I was a big sports enthusiast, but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old up to about 22 or so.
[00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:28.102]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:34.408]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work, I stopped working out.
[00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:39.193]  And everything was okay for four or five years, but then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:43.096]  And in the next 10 years, I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:56.459]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances, and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight, and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.040]  I even changed my diet.
[00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.742]  I even increased the exercise.
[00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:00.303]  It didn't work.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:06.190]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed
[00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.177]  My whole life changed.
[00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:14.844]  I've gone from 200 and almost 80 pounds down to about 220 pounds or so.
[00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:16.446]  It is incredible.
[00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:24.635]  And in just the last three years, Super Male Vitality, developed by Dr. Grube for mfulworthslife.com exclusively,
[00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:32.462]  And products like the Survival Shield X2 Nascent Ionine have just done incredible things for my body.
[00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:40.090]  I work out less, even though I'm older, I've lost more weight, my muscles got stronger, my stamina, my libido, and so much more.
[00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:46.455]  The truth is, we went out to bring you the very best we could, true game-changing products.

[00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.412]  This is Portland State University.
[00:23:10.153 --> 00:23:15.397]  And this is just, you know, hours ago that this is happening.
[00:23:15.938 --> 00:23:17.019]  You know, just the last few days.
[00:23:17.679 --> 00:23:19.881]  Portland State University, April 7th.
[00:23:20.381 --> 00:23:23.264]  Students for Trump meeting crashed by whack job activist.
[00:23:24.565 --> 00:23:30.930]  Laughing at liberals is, you know, cool side or whatever, but they're not addressing it for what it really is.
[00:23:31.731 --> 00:23:34.073]  And neither was the Gateway Pundit and others that ran stories on it.
[00:23:34.844 --> 00:23:38.245]  This isn't a clash of Trump and liberals.
[00:23:38.945 --> 00:23:43.866]  This is authoritarian control freaks showing up and shutting down people's free speech.
[00:23:44.466 --> 00:23:47.187]  Shrieking, yelling, pushing, hitting, attacking.
[00:23:47.207 --> 00:23:48.427]  And you hear women screaming.
[00:23:48.747 --> 00:23:49.868]  There's a lot of cuss words on this.
[00:23:49.888 --> 00:23:52.828]  I don't know if I can air this on the Nightly News.
[00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:58.690]  Because it's mainly of the six pro-Trump people that dared have the courage to defend free speech.
[00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.831]  Most of them are our listeners and we talk to them and it's in the video.
[00:24:04.147 --> 00:24:05.688]  Or the folks shooting the video talk to them.
[00:24:06.709 --> 00:24:09.211]  But that's what's so frustrating about this is they then call the police.
[00:24:09.251 --> 00:24:10.152]  This goes on for like an hour.
[00:24:11.053 --> 00:24:12.854]  And the police go, sorry, we're not coming to help you.
[00:24:13.235 --> 00:24:17.638]  Just like they won't arrest the illegal falling down drunk driving, but they'll arrest you if you're a citizen.
[00:24:18.339 --> 00:24:20.921]  It's discriminatory to be a citizen now under this globalist system.
[00:24:21.942 --> 00:24:26.345]  Well, here the police won't come, they won't help, and they let these people sit there and attack them.
[00:24:26.365 --> 00:24:31.530]  This is literal brown shirt behavior, if you want to use a fascist analogy or parallel.
[00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.735]  But a lot of them call themselves Maoist Youth Brigades or Red Guard.
[00:24:36.775 --> 00:24:38.917]  We've run into them here in Austin trying to shut down our free speechers.
[00:24:38.937 --> 00:24:39.898]  Footage of that we're going to show you.
[00:24:42.554 --> 00:24:49.277]  These are dangerous people, and they're so full of themselves, they believe you deserve to be attacked because you support Donald Trump or anybody else.
[00:24:49.317 --> 00:24:52.498]  And listen, if it's Donald Trump they're trying to ban today, it's everything else tomorrow.
[00:24:53.018 --> 00:24:55.779]  So let's play some of this audio and video.
[00:24:55.839 --> 00:25:01.601]  Obviously on the nightly news we can cut in a high-def, you know, version over the screen for you, but we're on Facebook Mentions and Periscope on Twitter.
[00:25:01.921 --> 00:25:02.942]  Let's go ahead and go to this right now.
[00:25:09.013 --> 00:25:11.394]  Red power, Mexican flag.
[00:25:11.874 --> 00:25:13.615]  This is what the foundations and stuff are funding.
[00:25:13.835 --> 00:25:14.856]  They've surrounded the building.
[00:25:16.237 --> 00:25:17.717]  They've surrounded the reading room.
[00:25:24.381 --> 00:25:25.582]  Hate has no place.
[00:25:25.942 --> 00:25:28.243]  And they define what hate is and then say you have no place.
[00:25:28.563 --> 00:25:29.604]  That's called totalitarianism.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:38.082]  I wanted to discuss the fact that you had set up a Trump promotion for this meeting in shock.
[00:25:38.723 --> 00:25:41.703]  They had chalked in a promotion for this meeting.
[00:25:41.763 --> 00:25:44.184]  Just from you guys, why should students support Trump?
[00:25:44.964 --> 00:25:46.065]  To make America great again.
[00:25:51.607 --> 00:25:53.328]  Oh my gosh, they put shock on the ground.
[00:25:53.348 --> 00:25:56.371]  People have to have psychologists come to them when they see the word Trump now.
[00:25:56.911 --> 00:25:59.273]  And then of course the bosses, the feminists, they all take over.
[00:25:59.594 --> 00:26:01.855]  They run everything because they follow the script of the state.
[00:26:01.875 --> 00:26:02.656]  They're not given power.
[00:26:02.676 --> 00:26:12.044]  Don't you want to know that I see you all and that this is what it looks like to actually get in the way of what white supremacy is?
[00:26:15.677 --> 00:26:17.739]  Like Obama said, I apologize, I'm appointing a white guy.
[00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:18.800]  White's inherently bad.
[00:26:19.181 --> 00:26:20.762]  Just do what she says, you're a white supremacist.
[00:26:30.312 --> 00:26:30.913]  She won't let him talk.
[00:26:30.953 --> 00:26:32.454]  Nah, nah, nah, nah, try to talk over you.
[00:26:32.734 --> 00:26:34.196]  And the hitting and all that comes up the pushing.
[00:26:46.118 --> 00:26:46.799]  Get down!
[00:26:46.839 --> 00:26:47.219]  Get down!
[00:26:47.259 --> 00:26:50.843]  What's the f***ing camera at me?
[00:26:50.904 --> 00:26:53.266]  What's the f***ing camera at me?
[00:26:53.286 --> 00:26:57.951]  What if that camera's not f***ing there with all these f***ing people?
[00:26:57.992 --> 00:27:01.415]  You want to get f***ed up by a f***ing vacuum or something?
[00:27:05.981 --> 00:27:11.167]  This guy's saying you want a bleep, a fag to hit you in the face and all this stuff when the guy's done nothing.
[00:27:11.187 --> 00:27:15.291]  Like he must hate gay people because he's a Trump supporter or he's just attending a meeting.
[00:27:15.331 --> 00:27:16.132]  He's just being attacked.
[00:27:16.973 --> 00:27:19.896]  You want to get effed up by a faggot?
[00:27:19.996 --> 00:27:21.938]  And then they use the n-word.
[00:27:21.978 --> 00:27:23.860]  They use the other words because they're empowered.
[00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:24.681]  They're good.
[00:27:24.721 --> 00:27:25.442]  They said they were.
[00:27:25.502 --> 00:27:25.883]  You're not.
[00:27:26.842 --> 00:27:27.862]  InfoWarship!
[00:27:27.922 --> 00:27:28.382]  InfoWarship!
[00:27:28.422 --> 00:27:30.403]  We are going to allow costume parties at Yale.
[00:27:30.423 --> 00:27:30.543]  No!
[00:27:30.703 --> 00:27:32.423]  And then it's coming up, listen to this, listen.
[00:27:32.603 --> 00:27:33.464]  InfoWarship!
[00:27:33.504 --> 00:27:34.444]  Then they act like they're hurt.
[00:27:49.872 --> 00:27:50.273]  Do you hear them?
[00:27:51.735 --> 00:27:55.941]  And then when they put Trump talk around the country, just Trump 2016, they have to get hundreds of psychologists.
[00:27:55.961 --> 00:27:56.622]  This is in the news.
[00:27:56.822 --> 00:27:58.845]  And the news is like, there were collapses today.
[00:27:58.946 --> 00:27:59.907]  They saw a Trump sign.
[00:28:00.207 --> 00:28:01.369]  We're having to restrict speech.
[00:28:01.449 --> 00:28:01.950]  And they see that.
[00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:05.355]  And then the dean comes out and says, at many of the colleges,
[00:28:06.519 --> 00:28:07.620]  Yes, this is a major problem.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.720]  We're having counseling.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.621]  I'm sorry for the trauma.
[00:28:09.901 --> 00:28:12.383]  And of course, Project Veritas goes out with pot constitutions.
[00:28:12.703 --> 00:28:15.905]  People get them and they go on with the pot constitution and go, I'm traumatized.
[00:28:16.005 --> 00:28:16.745]  I want it banned.
[00:28:17.045 --> 00:28:17.946]  I need a psychologist.
[00:28:17.966 --> 00:28:20.127]  They go, yes, give me that horrible thing.
[00:28:20.167 --> 00:28:20.888]  I'll take care of it.
[00:28:21.932 --> 00:28:23.613]  I mean, this is crazy, folks.
[00:28:23.953 --> 00:28:25.034]  This is brainwashing.
[00:28:25.054 --> 00:28:26.614]  They have turned them into total mental patients.
[00:28:40.723 --> 00:28:42.005]  I am on staff!
[00:28:42.385 --> 00:28:47.131]  Remember the other woman where they're not like at Kansas State or Missouri State?
[00:28:47.471 --> 00:28:54.979]  They're not allowing anybody to come on the greens or anywhere unless you're a social justice warrior and these white professor women walk over and go, get out of here!
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.800]  You don't have free speech!
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.201]  Get out of here!
[00:28:56.221 --> 00:28:57.863]  And she goes, give me some muscle!
[00:28:59.138 --> 00:29:00.179]  It's the exact same thing.
[00:29:00.239 --> 00:29:01.160]  Give me some muscle.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.243]  The Nightly News will bleep it, because we're on some TV and radio stations around the country.
[00:29:04.263 --> 00:29:06.525]  But for all these other channels, you can see it.
[00:29:07.006 --> 00:29:07.486]  Look at her, boy.
[00:29:07.506 --> 00:29:08.868]  She's the one that was like, yeah, followers!
[00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.752]  Now, again, this is her letting her know that she is in command.
[00:29:22.721 --> 00:29:26.322]  Oh man, these memes are gold.
[00:29:26.382 --> 00:29:28.503]  I'm on staff effort.
[00:29:41.032 --> 00:29:42.193]  She ought to be saying it like Roy Batty.
[00:29:42.433 --> 00:29:44.155]  I want more life ever.
[00:29:44.656 --> 00:29:45.617]  I like what Farrakhan says.
[00:29:45.677 --> 00:29:49.521]  We want some of this dirt or we're going to start tearing this sucker apart.
[00:29:49.761 --> 00:29:50.722]  I get something like that.
[00:29:51.043 --> 00:29:52.064]  Like, I want prosperity.
[00:29:52.204 --> 00:29:52.865]  I want jobs.
[00:29:52.985 --> 00:29:53.525]  I want money.
[00:29:53.605 --> 00:29:54.286]  I want success.
[00:29:54.566 --> 00:29:56.028]  I want in to the thing.
[00:29:56.428 --> 00:29:57.249]  I want to be accepted.
[00:29:57.329 --> 00:29:57.730]  Damn right.
[00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:58.070]  Let's go.
[00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:58.470]  Let's do it.
[00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:00.632]  We're going to tear this apart.
[00:30:00.712 --> 00:30:11.618]  That I at least get, but just running around trying to block somebody's free speech because they want prosperity and they want freedom and they're sick of all this leftist freaking communist crazy ass garbage.
[00:30:11.738 --> 00:30:12.999]  Jesus, excuse me.
[00:30:25.126 --> 00:30:30.709]  Oh yeah, they come in with their red guard stuff and then say, we need more space, we don't feel safe.
[00:30:30.969 --> 00:30:33.891]  InfoWars, ahhh, ahhh, can I get a tag over here?
[00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:36.252]  I already got a swag!
[00:30:36.372 --> 00:30:37.333]  Help me, I'm weak!
[00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:38.954]  Anyways, here we go.
[00:30:49.552 --> 00:30:52.494]  Look, they're all wearing their Chicano Nation, you know, stuff.
[00:30:52.574 --> 00:30:54.976]  It's just as racist as any white supremacist stuff.
[00:30:57.838 --> 00:30:58.498]  Look, look, leave!
[00:30:58.598 --> 00:30:58.979]  Get out!
[00:30:59.039 --> 00:30:59.939]  She's in command!
[00:31:00.039 --> 00:31:09.706]  But only because she's supported by the state, the offshore corporations, the Ford Foundation, the megabanks that are balkanizing everybody right now and are exploiting this poor idiot's ignorance.
[00:31:11.704 --> 00:31:12.064]  Get out!
[00:31:12.725 --> 00:31:14.847]  My family are poor immigrants.
[00:31:14.887 --> 00:31:16.508]  They came here legally.
[00:31:16.548 --> 00:31:18.490]  They paid thousands and thousands of dollars.
[00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:19.311]  They waited years.
[00:31:19.931 --> 00:31:29.799]  I don't see why it's fair to let other people who we have no idea who they are, they could be criminals, they could be anything, just waltz through the country with no sort of repercussions or anything that we don't see on camera.
[00:31:29.819 --> 00:31:33.082]  People of color, transporters... Well, this is a well-spoken guy.
[00:31:33.102 --> 00:31:35.725]  Now, he's only allowed to talk because he looks like he's part Hispanic.
[00:31:36.699 --> 00:31:38.200]  And it's whites doing this.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.601]  These are white races that run all this.
[00:31:39.981 --> 00:31:41.402]  They're using race as a control system.
[00:31:41.422 --> 00:31:50.087]  The Democrats got beat by the Republicans with the Civil Rights Act, so they flipped from being the Klan controllers to now controlling, quote, minorities, who are really the majority in most areas.
[00:31:51.848 --> 00:31:52.228]  Mecha!
[00:31:52.849 --> 00:31:53.809]  Let's show that Mecha.
[00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:55.570]  For those inside the race, everything.
[00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:57.331]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[00:31:58.052 --> 00:31:58.452]  Mecha.
[00:31:58.692 --> 00:32:03.455]  Ford Foundation, government-funded, super hardcore Klan organization for Hispanics.
[00:32:05.472 --> 00:32:10.197]  And the university set them up exclusively with La Raza, for those inside the race, everything.
[00:32:10.537 --> 00:32:11.558]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[00:32:11.618 --> 00:32:12.239]  Same slogan.
[00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:13.020]  Mecha.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.701]  La Raza means the race.
[00:32:15.122 --> 00:32:15.702]  La Raza.
[00:32:16.343 --> 00:32:16.943]  In your face.
[00:32:16.983 --> 00:32:18.085]  Mecha.
[00:32:18.165 --> 00:32:19.146]  Mecha.
[00:32:28.984 --> 00:32:33.086]  If you don't let her talk, I will **** you!
[00:32:33.126 --> 00:32:39.609]  By the way, at the, so they've already kicked everybody else out who's white, but those that are Trump supporters that aren't white are allowed to stay.
[00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.852]  If they try to talk, you shut your mouth, I'm on faculty, or I will F stuff up.
[00:32:45.332 --> 00:32:46.312]  And the cops aren't going to come.
[00:32:46.673 --> 00:32:48.073]  This is a political takeover.
[00:32:48.774 --> 00:32:51.995]  And they want to encourage these people to be aggressive and to be empowered.
[00:32:52.375 --> 00:32:54.877]  These are bullies, these are tyrants, these are takeover artists.
[00:32:55.557 --> 00:32:57.278]  Okay, this is the reality of what's going on.
[00:33:02.335 --> 00:33:11.519]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important area of InfoWars that runs the whole operation that is having such a big effect against the globalists.
[00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:19.983]  And I've said it over and over again, it is you the listeners and the viewers that send us the intel, the news tips, that support the broadcast, that spread the word.
[00:33:20.883 --> 00:33:23.984]  You are 90% of the operation or more.
[00:33:24.024 --> 00:33:27.166]  You don't stand beside us, you stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.
[00:34:06.286 --> 00:34:17.391]  When you choose AutoShip before checkout on your order at Infowarshore.com, we'll give you 10% off and give you guaranteed delivery of out-of-stock products that are on your AutoShip list.

[00:34:21.033 --> 00:34:28.437]  Listers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products when you need them each month.
[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:30.494]  Now it's finally here.
[00:34:30.954 --> 00:34:34.455]  AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:35.255]  It's easy.

[00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:53.400]  You add to that free shipping on orders of $50, it is a can't lose.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:07.205 --> 00:37:08.866]  Hey, this is the reality of what's going on.
[00:37:09.127 --> 00:37:10.688]  And I just showed you a bunch of examples of this.
[00:37:11.068 --> 00:37:12.429]  The illegal aliens can drive drunk.
[00:37:12.709 --> 00:37:13.390]  Nobody else can.
[00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.232]  These people can take over, block everything, do what they want.
[00:37:16.452 --> 00:37:17.653]  They're calling the police for an hour.
[00:37:18.054 --> 00:37:19.495]  This one over an hour will not come.
[00:37:20.255 --> 00:37:20.856]  Will not come.
[00:37:21.096 --> 00:37:23.818]  Because she's in charge and she will F stuff up.
[00:37:24.038 --> 00:37:25.119]  Now, whites, you get out.
[00:37:25.459 --> 00:37:25.980]  Unless you're with us.
[00:37:28.124 --> 00:37:38.513]  I'm talking to my fellow white folks here because Obama says I'm sorry I'm up trying to appoint the Supreme Court a white guy I apologize but she said she's white she's sorry but
[00:37:54.568 --> 00:37:56.910]  She's still enough of a human to be able to speak.
[00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.812]  And I'm sure she's going to tell them, you know, you need to get on down the road.
[00:37:59.852 --> 00:38:00.153]  Here we go.
[00:38:00.313 --> 00:38:03.275]  I'm talking about your white folks here.
[00:38:03.455 --> 00:38:10.501]  The only way to combat this shit is to join an organization that has an anti-racist, anti-capitalist stance.
[00:38:10.581 --> 00:38:12.423]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:38:12.463 --> 00:38:17.186]  And you take it out the f***ing way and that people of color and indigenous people organize this stuff.
[00:38:17.892 --> 00:38:18.172]  That's right.
[00:38:18.512 --> 00:38:23.136]  I'm talking to my fellow white folks who are all being bullied here and you saw us run folks off.
[00:38:23.476 --> 00:38:24.376]  You feeling scared?
[00:38:24.396 --> 00:38:25.677]  You're not feeling wanted right now?
[00:38:25.937 --> 00:38:28.919]  We're going to blame the six whites we ran out of here, okay?
[00:38:28.959 --> 00:38:31.241]  And you're going to join us right now and say you're with us.
[00:38:31.781 --> 00:38:39.667]  We'll be nice to you as long as you hate your race and hate capitalism and hate America so that multinationals that are tax-exempt can turn us all into slaves.
[00:38:39.987 --> 00:38:41.108]  Let's listen to her very, very carefully.
[00:38:41.128 --> 00:38:42.849]  You could teach a whole course on these people.
[00:38:43.496 --> 00:38:46.318]  I'm talking about your whole life, folks.
[00:38:46.358 --> 00:38:53.282]  The only way to combat this shit is to join an organization that has an anti-racist, anti-capitalist stance.
[00:38:53.402 --> 00:38:55.544]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:38:55.624 --> 00:39:00.407]  And dig it out the f***ing way and let people of color and indigenous people organize themselves.
[00:39:01.169 --> 00:39:03.410]  Anti-racist, anti-capitalist stance.
[00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:09.413]  And all those traumatized freshmen, where mommy and daddy saved all their money to send them to Portland, they get there and they're just beat up and everything.
[00:39:09.453 --> 00:39:19.297]  And then, I'll tell you, four horrible white guys, two Hispanic Trump supporters, dared come and sit there and talk, and they were physically assaulted, hit, and attacked, and run out.
[00:39:19.778 --> 00:39:24.240]  And then people unfurled flags that say, for the race, everything, those outside the race, nothing.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.241]  La raza mecha.
[00:39:27.441 --> 00:39:29.102]  And then a white woman gets up and says, listen whites,
[00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:31.090]  You want to combat this?
[00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:34.032]  You join us and you stand up against the evil white people.
[00:39:34.312 --> 00:39:35.973]  Look at her smile of approval right there.
[00:39:36.093 --> 00:39:37.533]  Look at the smile, yes.
[00:39:37.593 --> 00:39:38.234]  Look at the smugness.
[00:39:38.254 --> 00:39:40.595]  I mean, look at the insanity, the power trip.
[00:39:40.875 --> 00:39:43.496]  People with chips on their shoulders, taught by TV, everybody hates them.
[00:39:44.136 --> 00:39:47.458]  That's right, now whites just submit and the people of color, you organize, okay?
[00:39:47.478 --> 00:39:53.200]  Because the Ford Foundation and the mega banks, they run things now and they're going to teach you how to really be successful.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:58.022]  Now they're going to teach you how to be hated, reviled, in your own little poor group, controlled by a local mob boss.
[00:39:58.903 --> 00:39:59.043]  Okay?
[00:39:59.063 --> 00:39:59.503]  Let's keep going.
[00:40:00.342 --> 00:40:10.624]  Every single Trump supporter has a full legal name attached to a social security number with a place of residence, an employer, and classes.
[00:40:10.965 --> 00:40:13.685]  That information is easy to find online.
[00:40:13.965 --> 00:40:15.766]  Let's terrorize people now.
[00:40:15.786 --> 00:40:16.526]  Let's go bully them.
[00:40:16.746 --> 00:40:20.707]  Like the Nazis painting the stars and knocking out the windows in Kristallnacht.
[00:40:20.947 --> 00:40:21.267]  Here we go.
[00:40:21.567 --> 00:40:23.088]  You need to look up the laws.
[00:40:23.149 --> 00:40:23.649]  It's ORS 165.540.
[00:40:23.689 --> 00:40:23.949]  I know them.
[00:40:37.522 --> 00:40:39.623]  And look, no, no, no, you can't videotape in this common area.
[00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:47.329]  We're the bosses and it's just like in San Francisco where the two black students come up and beat up the white guy that has like dreadlocks and it's like, yo, yo, yo, I'm down with it.
[00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:48.710]  You know, I submit to you.
[00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:49.951]  I'm down with my culture.
[00:40:50.011 --> 00:40:50.511]  I submit to you.
[00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:51.572]  They're like just beating him up.
[00:40:52.233 --> 00:40:53.173]  Then they attack the camera.
[00:40:53.193 --> 00:40:55.095]  This is just the total mental illness, folks.
[00:40:55.575 --> 00:40:56.436]  And look, attack on the camera.
[00:40:56.656 --> 00:41:01.140]  It is illegal to film people when they tell you not to film them.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.622]  Not in a public space.
[00:41:02.662 --> 00:41:05.985]  There is no perception of privacy in the middle of a university.
[00:41:06.245 --> 00:41:09.828]  They want to make everything a safe space where they get to bully, but you don't even get speech.
[00:41:10.769 --> 00:41:12.050]  Everything they say is a total lie.
[00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:13.031]  Look up the laws.
[00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:13.952]  It's ORS 165.540.
[00:41:20.134 --> 00:41:21.214]  Your camera's not going to be working.
[00:41:21.254 --> 00:41:22.155]  Oh, look at her, boy.
[00:41:22.175 --> 00:41:22.995]  She is in charge.
[00:41:23.015 --> 00:41:23.695]  She is pissed.
[00:41:24.395 --> 00:41:27.076]  And see, it's narcissism the media gives you.
[00:41:27.156 --> 00:41:27.856]  Inadequacy.
[00:41:28.196 --> 00:41:28.976]  Then they sell them.
[00:41:29.016 --> 00:41:35.838]  Madison Avenue used to sell, buy this washing machine, buy this dress, buy this sewing machine, smoke these cigarettes, you'll be beautiful and cool.
[00:41:36.118 --> 00:41:40.019]  Now they say, hate white people, be out of control, look at Beyonce on the Super Bowl.
[00:41:40.399 --> 00:41:41.980]  You know, this is how you fight the establishment.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.440]  Because the Super Bowl told you so.
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.241]  You are the biggest chump there is for the establishment.
[00:41:47.745 --> 00:41:51.186]  What he has made very clear, though, is that he hates Mexicans.
[00:41:51.687 --> 00:41:55.548]  He hates Muslim people.
[00:41:55.588 --> 00:41:58.689]  I think the radical Muslims showed us they hate us blowing stuff up and shooting innocent people.
[00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.790]  Why are we letting them in and not even checking their IDs?
[00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.771]  But citizens are.
[00:42:01.811 --> 00:42:02.571]  That's all Trump said.
[00:42:03.011 --> 00:42:07.893]  And Mexico has the strongest border in this hemisphere, so why can't we have some basic vetting?
[00:42:07.913 --> 00:42:09.394]  See, they take common sense and invert it.
[00:42:10.154 --> 00:42:12.015]  And then she's the faculty member in control.
[00:42:12.657 --> 00:42:16.123]  What he has made very clear, though, is that he hates Mexicans.
[00:42:16.684 --> 00:42:17.526]  He hates Muslim people!
[00:42:17.566 --> 00:42:18.608]  Citation needed!
[00:42:19.997 --> 00:42:21.177]  She's the perfect model.
[00:42:21.217 --> 00:42:23.278]  She's got the black dad, the white mom.
[00:42:23.298 --> 00:42:27.839]  Let's just check statistically.
[00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:29.619]  She's the perfect social justice warrior.
[00:42:29.639 --> 00:42:31.759]  She probably even denounced her mom.
[00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:37.541]  I have white friends who have mixed children through their granddaughters.
[00:42:37.561 --> 00:42:38.701]  They come and finally denounce them.
[00:42:39.021 --> 00:42:44.122]  Even though they put them in college, treat them, kiss their ass, they finally come to grandma and they denounce you as white evil and say, I don't identify.
[00:42:44.602 --> 00:42:47.743]  Because they've got to choose the hatred they've been indoctrinated with.
[00:42:48.083 --> 00:42:48.783]  This is it.
[00:42:49.243 --> 00:42:50.703]  And she's the boss.
[00:42:50.743 --> 00:42:51.543]  She's the faculty.
[00:42:51.583 --> 00:42:52.283]  She stands up.
[00:42:52.363 --> 00:42:53.064]  She did everything.
[00:42:53.424 --> 00:42:54.284]  Mom did everything.
[00:42:54.524 --> 00:42:55.504]  Everything she was supposed to do.
[00:42:56.404 --> 00:42:57.424]  Followed everything they were told.
[00:42:57.484 --> 00:42:59.245]  And now, it's her time to take over.
[00:43:00.425 --> 00:43:01.405]  For the foreign banks that run her.
[00:43:02.285 --> 00:43:11.207]  I want everybody here to know that I've just participated in a successful drop shut down.
[00:43:11.287 --> 00:43:11.767]  You just...
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.262]  We're in a successful Trump shutdown.
[00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:17.503]  You shut down some free speech.
[00:43:18.324 --> 00:43:21.226]  Bankers are going to shut down your prosperity and your whole future too, you idiot.
[00:43:21.826 --> 00:43:23.147]  Mega banks funding all of this.
[00:43:23.207 --> 00:43:28.691]  Soros, overthrowing countries, Arab Spring, Ukraine, starting war with Russia, all of these people don't know.
[00:43:29.011 --> 00:43:32.594]  They just know, hey, humans are tribal, humans are racist at a base level.
[00:43:32.974 --> 00:43:34.515]  You get to go with it because you're a minority.
[00:43:34.575 --> 00:43:35.275]  Go crazy.
[00:43:35.676 --> 00:43:36.676]  Attack people's free speech.
[00:43:36.997 --> 00:43:37.697]  Say whatever you want.
[00:43:37.757 --> 00:43:39.799]  Unfurl racist Mexican flags.
[00:43:40.119 --> 00:43:41.520]  You know, it's all wonderful.
[00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:49.573]  And if y'all try it again, the same s*** is gonna happen!
[00:43:49.673 --> 00:43:50.654]  I promise you!
[00:43:50.814 --> 00:43:51.514]  I promise you!
[00:43:51.534 --> 00:43:52.175]  Sounds like a Muppet.
[00:43:52.555 --> 00:43:53.996]  You're not gabbin' your free speech, you understand?
[00:43:54.016 --> 00:43:57.519]  And we're gonna freak you out and call for psychologists if we see the word Trump in chalk.
[00:43:57.799 --> 00:43:58.359]  And InfoWars!
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:43:59.160]  InfoWars!
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:43:59.740]  Woo!
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.161]  Woo!
[00:44:00.261 --> 00:44:01.862]  I mean, this is, this is their, all their game.
[00:44:03.373 --> 00:44:09.481]  I mean, I've been on the street covering these events, and someone will say, he touched me, he hit me, and go, oh, oh, it's what they do.
[00:44:09.541 --> 00:44:14.507]  It's all, they keep catching all these Muslims running around saying they got knifed or they got attacked.
[00:44:14.567 --> 00:44:15.308]  It's all made up.
[00:44:15.588 --> 00:44:21.616]  At the colleges, the fake swastikas, the lacrosse team raped me, all false flag, all made up.
[00:44:21.636 --> 00:44:22.216]  It all comes out.
[00:44:22.944 --> 00:44:25.025]  I mean, how are we going to have a country?
[00:44:25.065 --> 00:44:27.906]  I'm not against trannies and stuff, or people.
[00:44:27.926 --> 00:44:29.727]  Look at this tranny person back here.
[00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:31.708]  These people are so disconnected from reality.
[00:44:52.731 --> 00:44:53.712]  It's a fantasy land.
[00:44:54.132 --> 00:45:02.877]  They've just shut down people's free speech, but then they want to run around and be transgendered in a country that lets you do that when you'd be killed in all these Muslim countries.
[00:45:03.538 --> 00:45:06.739]  And then you look at the place that gave you all this freedom, knock yourself out, I don't care.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.561]  And you think we're the bigots?
[00:45:09.534 --> 00:45:12.977]  Because we don't want China to have a 35-40% tariff on us, and we don't have one on them?
[00:45:13.677 --> 00:45:14.718]  Now we're anti-Chinese?
[00:45:15.578 --> 00:45:16.339]  Anti-white.
[00:45:16.359 --> 00:45:19.921]  A lot of them hate white people.
[00:45:20.082 --> 00:45:20.862]  And they took it over.
[00:45:20.882 --> 00:45:21.623]  That's it.
[00:45:21.703 --> 00:45:22.583]  It's anti-white.
[00:45:22.603 --> 00:45:24.985]  This guy, when you get him on the show, he gets it all.
[00:45:25.746 --> 00:45:27.107]  And folks, it just goes on.
[00:45:27.507 --> 00:45:28.588]  It just goes on from there.
[00:45:28.868 --> 00:45:29.308]  It's sick.
[00:45:29.488 --> 00:45:29.748]  Women.
[00:45:30.689 --> 00:45:35.633]  Hispanics, blacks, whatever quote group you think you're part of, you're being totally manipulated, totally chomped.
[00:45:36.813 --> 00:45:43.558]  They know that whites have been integrating and fighting the system for hundreds of years to end slavery worldwide.
[00:45:43.618 --> 00:45:45.740]  They know that it all started in Europe to end slavery.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.602]  They know that Christians are bringing people up and ending Balkanization.
[00:45:49.622 --> 00:45:50.343]  They want to end that.
[00:45:51.741 --> 00:46:02.825]  And they have taken the movement over to make sure that whites get scared and become racist and don't work with you and don't try to bring you up into the economic system and ensure that everybody's poor.
[00:46:04.085 --> 00:46:10.008]  So this is to make sure middle class whites mainly, there's a lot of middle class people, but whites make up the biggest group of that because they're still the majority there.
[00:46:10.028 --> 00:46:13.889]  This is to make sure you get hurt real bad and people are scared of you and don't work with you.
[00:46:14.793 --> 00:46:19.364]  And I know it's real cute and fun to have the psych warfare universities telling you it's okay and they love you.
[00:46:19.585 --> 00:46:22.672]  They're there to hamstring you and handicap you in life, okay?
[00:47:03.014 --> 00:47:04.015]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.556 --> 00:47:06.838]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.118 --> 00:47:14.967]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:05.899 --> 00:49:10.084]  Well there was utter chaos at Portland State University Thursday evening.
[00:49:10.164 --> 00:49:16.250]  More than a hundred social justice warriors showed up to shut down a pro-Trump group.
[00:49:16.611 --> 00:49:20.755]  Now this was the forming meeting for Portland State students for Donald Trump.
[00:49:21.075 --> 00:49:24.199]  They all showed up to shut down and silence the pro-Trump group.
[00:49:24.219 --> 00:49:26.962]  They mocked their talking points, whined about Trump
[00:49:27.262 --> 00:49:29.084]  Chalk on the sidewalk.
[00:49:29.204 --> 00:49:30.745]  Oh, it's the chalkening all over again.
[00:49:31.285 --> 00:49:38.992]  And then they were also issuing threats to shut down any future meetings if the group dared try to assemble in the future.
[00:49:39.832 --> 00:49:45.337]  And joining me now are two students there out of Portland, speaking with Matt Duffy and Vladimir Kolachev.
[00:49:45.397 --> 00:49:51.081]  Now, Vladimir, you are the organizer, the leader there of these Portland students for Donald Trump.
[00:49:51.482 --> 00:49:54.044]  Now, what prompted you to bring this meeting on?
[00:49:54.164 --> 00:49:56.446]  Obviously, you guys seem like you're the minority on campus.
[00:49:57.956 --> 00:49:58.216]  I don't know.
[00:50:14.685 --> 00:50:41.654]  I made a list and we got about 25 people and we expected maybe 30 protesters to come because when these guys shut down like a board meeting they usually have maybe 30 people but I think a hundred at least people showed up to protest us and there were violent Antifa members who tried one of them tried to assault my friend and but for the most part they were just really loud and really disrespectful essentially.
[00:50:42.185 --> 00:50:47.028]  Yeah, and so you say that, is that like an anti-fascist movement on campus?
[00:50:47.808 --> 00:50:54.653]  Well, okay, they describe themselves as anti-fascist, but their whole goal is beating up anyone that disagrees with them.
[00:50:54.673 --> 00:51:01.016]  Right, so they're basically using fascist tactics to shut you down and silence you and intimidate you into not having your meetings.
[00:51:01.036 --> 00:51:01.637]  Yes, Stalinist tactics.
[00:51:02.737 --> 00:51:02.978]  Exactly.
[00:51:03.678 --> 00:51:04.178]  Excellent.
[00:51:04.699 --> 00:51:10.982]  And so, so you're saying that you put this together and you kind of knew you were going to get a little bit of a backlash here, so
[00:51:12.429 --> 00:51:15.450]  Was that the idea with putting the chalk on campus?
[00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:17.891]  Because why are people so triggered by chalk?
[00:51:17.931 --> 00:51:18.511]  What's happening?
[00:51:19.771 --> 00:51:21.452]  I don't know.
[00:51:21.492 --> 00:51:23.712]  I think the chalk thing became a sort of symbol.
[00:51:23.772 --> 00:51:27.673]  And the reason we did it in chalk is because everyone else did it in chalk.
[00:51:28.073 --> 00:51:29.254]  And we had a very intricate...
[00:51:30.254 --> 00:51:31.655]  I can send you a picture of it.
[00:51:31.835 --> 00:51:42.298]  We had a very intricate, pretty one, and nobody touched us while we were down there, but as soon as my friend left to take a picture, people started getting confrontational with me, but nobody actually did anything violent.
[00:51:42.338 --> 00:51:47.660]  And then we finally went upstairs and filmed from above there, and some guy came in and defaced it, and we filmed him.
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.061]  We were like, what are you doing, dude?
[00:51:49.541 --> 00:51:50.661]  And he just ran away.
[00:51:50.801 --> 00:51:55.283]  And I posted that online, and they saw a bunch of it, so that maybe also had another effect.
[00:51:57.076 --> 00:52:00.739]  Well, this is the big civil rights movement of our time.
[00:52:00.819 --> 00:52:02.080]  People need to take down Trump.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:09.886]  They're not going there, of course, and shutting down any pro-Hillary meetings, things like that, when, of course, that's Bernie Sanders' main competition.
[00:52:10.466 --> 00:52:13.008]  Now, Matt, so you were there at this meeting.
[00:52:13.189 --> 00:52:14.490]  Tell me about your experience.
[00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:15.911]  What did you think?
[00:52:16.551 --> 00:52:22.696]  Well basically we all gathered there was about at the beginning there was about 10 or 11 or maybe 12 of us.
[00:52:22.736 --> 00:52:31.642]  We sat down at a table and then immediately we were swarmed by at least over a hundred Black Lives Matter Bernie people all surrounding us.
[00:52:32.443 --> 00:52:33.604]  They wouldn't let us speak.
[00:52:36.866 --> 00:52:39.248]  Our group would try to talk and they would immediately just
[00:52:40.086 --> 00:52:41.587]  Shout at us, tell us to shut up.
[00:52:42.747 --> 00:52:48.410]  I would whisper something to my friend next to me and I would get hit on the back and told to shut up.
[00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:49.170]  Wow.
[00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:55.814]  So after that, we moved to another part of the room because there was no conversation.
[00:52:55.874 --> 00:52:57.194]  There was no dialogue really happening.
[00:52:57.855 --> 00:53:04.578]  We moved to another part of the room where we had some really good dialogue amongst about five or six Trump people and three or four Bernie people.
[00:53:05.453 --> 00:53:11.858]  And then the Black Lives Matter people surrounded us again, and then they tightly enclosed around us.
[00:53:12.078 --> 00:53:15.440]  And then I was, me and my friend were physically assaulted.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:19.023]  We were shoved, pushed, and there's video of that online.
[00:53:19.683 --> 00:53:22.906]  And then my friend's hat was stolen from him and then thrown across the room.
[00:53:23.546 --> 00:53:28.028]  So, that's the tolerant liberals right there.
[00:53:28.388 --> 00:53:31.650]  So, they scream tolerance, yet they are the most intolerant people.
[00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:36.452]  And they were all blatantly anti-white, hated white people.
[00:53:36.492 --> 00:53:46.317]  Their main argument was, well, because you're white, that means you're a racist, because your ancestors, you know, killed natives and, you know, did all this stuff.
[00:53:47.037 --> 00:53:51.159]  So, I'm basically being held accountable for things my ancestors may or may not have done.
[00:53:51.759 --> 00:53:51.959]  Right.
[00:53:52.019 --> 00:53:54.141]  Which is completely ridiculous.
[00:53:54.321 --> 00:53:59.104]  Right, and of course slavery has only happened here in the United States of America.
[00:53:59.284 --> 00:53:59.664]  Exactly.
[00:53:59.684 --> 00:54:12.212]  Let's just go ahead and rewrite history so that it suits the present-day people who are clearly being programmed there on campus, but are under the impression that this is a totally authentic revolution that is happening right now.
[00:54:14.354 --> 00:54:17.916]  They seem to forget that white people ended slavery in America.
[00:54:17.936 --> 00:54:18.436]  Yeah.
[00:54:18.456 --> 00:54:19.457]  They seem to forget that.
[00:54:19.537 --> 00:54:21.077]  It was predominantly white Christians.
[00:54:21.158 --> 00:54:25.220]  Then it was white Christians who said, why don't we end it around the globe?
[00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.381]  Yeah, worldwide, in fact.
[00:54:27.401 --> 00:54:28.202]  Exactly.
[00:54:29.062 --> 00:54:30.223]  You sound racist.
[00:54:31.249 --> 00:54:32.350]  Oh, well, hey, listen.
[00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:33.650]  Facts are racist, Matt.
[00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:34.131]  Exactly.
[00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:36.972]  They were just throwing the label of racist at us.
[00:54:37.552 --> 00:54:39.113]  And we didn't grovel to them.
[00:54:39.153 --> 00:54:39.934]  We didn't bow down.
[00:54:40.274 --> 00:54:40.894]  We stood up.
[00:54:40.994 --> 00:54:41.474]  We fought.
[00:54:41.855 --> 00:54:43.375]  And that's what made them angry.
[00:54:43.455 --> 00:54:45.356]  I don't think they were there because they hated Trump.
[00:54:45.637 --> 00:54:47.077]  They were there because they hated us.
[00:54:47.457 --> 00:54:53.641]  And the fact that we didn't bow down to them, we didn't grovel to them, we didn't just curl up in a ball and say, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[00:54:53.681 --> 00:54:54.241]  We stood up.
[00:54:54.541 --> 00:54:55.582]  We stood up for free speech.
[00:54:55.622 --> 00:54:56.702]  We stood up for Donald Trump.
[00:54:56.762 --> 00:54:57.963]  And we stood up for the Republic.
[00:54:58.393 --> 00:55:04.215]  Yeah, and that's what you've got to do because that's the thing is that totalitarians don't like when you don't agree with their ideology.
[00:55:04.615 --> 00:55:09.336]  Now Vladimir, so the rumor was that the police were called but they didn't show up?
[00:55:10.636 --> 00:55:15.718]  Yes, so when the anti-fascist guy jumped on the table and tried to assault my friend,
[00:55:16.278 --> 00:55:25.060]  I went down to another building and asked them to give us the number of the campus security.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:32.961]  And when I did get that number, a bunch of... I called them and they said they sent somebody down, but I saw no one in uniform.
[00:55:33.241 --> 00:55:35.102]  Maybe they sent someone who was plain clothed.
[00:55:35.262 --> 00:55:39.163]  So I can't really say that they didn't come, but there's no evidence that they did come either.
[00:55:39.483 --> 00:55:41.163]  And so I have no clue.
[00:55:41.889 --> 00:55:46.091]  Well you know safe spaces aren't for people with an opposing viewpoint.
[00:55:46.231 --> 00:55:49.873]  Obviously they only create these safe spaces for a certain kind of student.
[00:55:50.333 --> 00:55:57.116]  So now we saw at the end of the video there were making threats to shut down any future meetings that you all decide to put on.
[00:55:57.456 --> 00:56:04.660]  Are you guys going to cower to the demands or will you be putting on another meeting and would you like to make a call to action right now?
[00:56:06.994 --> 00:56:08.315]  I don't know how soon we can have another.
[00:56:08.636 --> 00:56:09.496]  We should have another meeting.
[00:56:09.516 --> 00:56:10.337]  I mean, we're all students.
[00:56:10.377 --> 00:56:11.518]  We have studies and all of that.
[00:56:11.859 --> 00:56:13.380]  But I think maybe within a month.
[00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:17.584]  And I've had people message me up and say that they're going to come to the next one.
[00:56:17.805 --> 00:56:20.827]  So if everyone comes again, we might have 50 people.
[00:56:21.768 --> 00:56:23.990]  I think it's very, very infected.
[00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:28.933]  The fact that if you stand up for your beliefs, other people who are less confident, they stand up for their beliefs as well.
[00:56:29.574 --> 00:56:31.295]  And these guys aren't going to increase.
[00:56:31.695 --> 00:56:35.178]  They're pretty much, their utility is gone.
[00:56:35.198 --> 00:56:36.819]  They're not going to increase in size.
[00:56:37.899 --> 00:56:57.684]  Well, and so that's the issue with it there, is that you can't really fight those people with, you have to fight them with facts, and the only thing that they have to retaliate with is authoritarianism, intimidation, intimidation tactics, and violent threats, and it's great that you guys got all of this on video, because it
[00:56:58.544 --> 00:57:00.645]  So tell me, how can people get in touch with your group?
[00:57:17.527 --> 00:57:24.233]  Well, they can contact our Facebook page, or they can contact me, or, yeah, just contact the Facebook page.
[00:57:24.373 --> 00:57:26.855]  Portland State Students for Donald Trump.
[00:57:27.355 --> 00:57:27.556]  Yes.
[00:57:28.116 --> 00:57:28.496]  Awesome.
[00:57:28.937 --> 00:57:35.463]  And I'll be making people moderators, so we can have, you know, it's hard for me and my friend to do it by ourselves.
[00:57:35.963 --> 00:57:38.625]  So, I added Matt as a moderator now.
[00:57:39.884 --> 00:57:41.105]  Well, we got about a minute left.
[00:57:41.165 --> 00:57:49.388]  Matt, do you guys have anything to say to any people out there who might be afraid to stand up on their campus for fear of the same type of retaliation?
[00:57:50.089 --> 00:57:55.651]  Well, look, you just have to use... I mean, their arguments can be easily broken apart with basic logic.
[00:57:55.691 --> 00:58:01.814]  They said, because I'm white, that means I'm racist and my ancestors were racist and I need to be held accountable for that.
[00:58:01.834 --> 00:58:04.135]  Well, you know, Bernie Sanders is white.
[00:58:04.155 --> 00:58:05.696]  Why aren't they holding him accountable?
[00:58:06.216 --> 00:58:09.317]  So just use basic logic and it feels good.
[00:58:09.737 --> 00:58:16.339]  It felt really good, you know, being outnumbered, you know, 15 to one, maybe 12 to one, something like that.
[00:58:16.599 --> 00:58:21.220]  Completely outnumbered and it felt good raising my hand and saying, yes, I support Donald Trump.
[00:58:21.321 --> 00:58:22.661]  It feels good to stand up.
[00:58:23.308 --> 00:58:26.349]  And another aspect of this is you can easily predict their arguments.
[00:58:27.329 --> 00:58:32.271]  I was saying something and this girl wanted to ask me a question and she actually got shut down by her own leftist.
[00:58:32.611 --> 00:58:34.632]  I was like, well I know what you're going to say and I guessed it.
[00:58:34.672 --> 00:58:36.893]  She was very surprised that I knew exactly what she was going to say.
[00:58:37.628 --> 00:58:38.769]  Right, and that's just it.
[00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:44.992]  You've got to arm yourself with facts and logic and people will just melt like the Wicked Witch did, of course, in the movies.
[00:58:45.272 --> 00:58:51.315]  Guys, thank you so much and we'll be sending you some t-shirts so you can trigger all of the anti-fascists out there.
[00:58:51.555 --> 00:58:51.975]  Thanks, guys.
