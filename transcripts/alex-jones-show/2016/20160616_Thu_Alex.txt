[00:00:02.926 --> 00:00:04.407]  We are on the march.
[00:00:04.787 --> 00:00:07.189]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.693]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.804]  Well, NATO has come out with an official policy.
[00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:30.768]  ...statement and said that cyber attacks directed by Russia against any Western infrastructure...
[00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:38.038]  Any computer systems will be seen as an act of war and that NATO may respond with military force.
[00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.780]  That is really an unprecedented statement.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.881]  We'll be looking at that today.
[00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:51.667]  Speaking of living on the edge, Breitbart is now reporting on something that we began to expose five years ago when the Syrian conflict was started by NATO and the Clintonistas along with the Obama crew.
[00:00:52.348 --> 00:00:59.953]  Obama and men aided group that became ISIS to control area where ISIS formed its caliphate.
[00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:10.056]  And the point is that there are now more government memos and Pentagon reports coming out confirming everything the Pentagon told us five years ago.
[00:01:10.076 --> 00:01:14.018]  And of course we didn't need the Pentagon to tell us, we were already exposing it.
[00:01:14.038 --> 00:01:17.340]  The Pentagon just confirmed that to Infowars.com.
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.385]  They also told Cy Hirsch that, they also told many others that, who did not run with the story at the first.
[00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:26.725]  Because they were too afraid to.
[00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:28.746]  And I'm not criticizing those people.
[00:01:29.186 --> 00:01:33.468]  It's just, everyone needs to understand, I don't get up here and make things up.
[00:01:34.348 --> 00:01:35.648]  Sometimes I'm satirical.
[00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:37.769]  Sometimes we, you know, have a little bit of fun.
[00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:44.131]  But we're very clear and demarc with demarcation when we're being silly versus when we're being serious.
[00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:44.711]  And more and more,
[00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:50.313]  I'm not silly, even though that's something that takes the edge off and gallows humor is certainly needed.
[00:01:50.754 --> 00:02:03.520]  More and more, we are about 98% very serious around here these days because the time is getting late, as Jimi Hendrix would say, or I guess as Bob Dylan would say, when he wrote all along Watchtower.
[00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.460]  Boy, I tell you, this is going to be a broadcast today.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.363]  I had Dr. Tony Bark coming on, an amazing medical doctor, exposing the dangers of vaccines.
[00:02:12.383 --> 00:02:18.806]  But with all the terror heating up and what's happening in the economy, I'm offering to move her into the fourth hour with Rob Dew, because he loves to talk about vaccines.
[00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:21.067]  So do I, but he really is into that even more than I am.
[00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:22.368]  Such a central issue.
[00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:24.369]  Or she can come on with us next week.
[00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:28.331]  But we've got Jakari Jackson coming on at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:33.154]  He got some really eye-opening, just some of the most amazing of a giant
[00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:41.035]  It's a system, a constellation of amazing footage that our crew have gotten in the last year at Trump rallies.
[00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:46.476]  He got some really amazing footage that we're going to be going over today.
[00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:48.137]  We'll be playing some of those clips.
[00:02:48.157 --> 00:02:51.777]  He's been on the road covering anti-Trump events the last three days.
[00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:59.599]  Several of our reporters as we speak are in a car driving to Dallas to cover the Trump event tonight.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.260]  It's seven o'clock.
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:21.711]  There are reportedly socialist and Democrats and battleground Texas groups, that's an illegal alien promoting group basically, that are saying they are giving, you know, thousands of people free bus rides from all the state to conflagrate up in Big D. And that kicks off tonight at seven.
[00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:25.954]  We'll have coverage of that on the nightly news tonight, seven o'clock central.
[00:03:27.304 --> 00:03:32.111]  So definitely stay with Infowars.com for all of that today.
[00:03:32.872 --> 00:03:42.906]  We also have Citizens for Trump, the head of that organization, on, highly recommended by Roger Stone and the whole Trump operation separately.
[00:03:44.264 --> 00:03:51.047]  They have been basically denied permits for myself and Roger Schoen and others to hold free speech rallies in Cleveland.
[00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:59.670]  And so the ACLU has asked myself and others to become co-signatories to a lawsuit demanding access to the First Amendment.
[00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.351]  They're in Cleveland and we're going to be doing that.
[00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:05.152]  I'm going to be a plaintiff to that.
[00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:06.573]  And I'm going to demonstrate.
[00:04:07.193 --> 00:04:08.313]  So that's just the end of it.
[00:04:09.174 --> 00:04:12.575]  And the communists, of course, will be running around attacking police and everything.
[00:04:12.595 --> 00:04:16.016]  It'll be coddled and protected by the police because it's a Democrat-run city.
[00:04:16.536 --> 00:04:22.599]  And I'm sure we'll be excoriated for being horrible and evil and just peacefully engaging in the First Amendment.
[00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:23.839]  But it's going to happen.
[00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.720]  So that's just the way it is.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.464]  Black Lives Matter can organize its latest move to shoot cops in the back of the head and be given all the permits they could ever want.
[00:04:32.484 --> 00:04:37.027]  Of course, they just don't even get permits and are left alone, because it's all this George Soros-funded garbage.
[00:04:37.047 --> 00:04:45.132]  The same people that fund ISIS and that fund the Nazis in Ukraine and every other evil organization are just trying to overthrow this country and bully us into submission.
[00:04:45.152 --> 00:04:47.354]  And I don't know how all this is going to end, but I know this.
[00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.294]  I'm not backing down.
[00:04:48.314 --> 00:04:49.055]  I'm not giving in.
[00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:49.775]  I'm not giving up.
[00:04:50.176 --> 00:04:52.457]  Especially when we're starting to turn the tide against this slime.
[00:04:52.857 --> 00:04:54.999]  Big transmission, huge news across the board.
[00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:56.240]  Straight ahead.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.901]  They're coming after our guns big time.
[00:04:59.822 --> 00:05:11.048]  Everyone, Obama and Trump, as well as the NRA and LGBT lobbyists, are saying the Orlando shooting requires new gun control measures because it's now an issue of national security.
[00:05:11.268 --> 00:05:14.350]  Democrats in Congress just ended a 15-hour filibuster.
[00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.534]  Republicans have caved and said they will hold a vote on whether to block people who have just been labeled a terrorist.
[00:05:20.734 --> 00:05:23.698]  Remember, this is secretly and without trial.
[00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:35.012]  People are put on terror watch lists and no-fly watch lists without their knowledge, without being told of the charges against them, without being able to confront their accusers in an open trial by jury.
[00:05:35.173 --> 00:05:38.517]  Now we're going to apply punishments and sanctions against them.
[00:05:38.757 --> 00:05:42.698]  This is a star chamber process that the Bill of Rights was written to stop.
[00:05:42.918 --> 00:05:45.519]  Terror attacks are not a gun control issue.
[00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:47.320]  They're a border control issue.
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.581]  Without background checks for migrants, terrorists are free to use nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.
[00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:56.622]  A rifle may be your only defense against that kind of weapon.
[00:05:56.842 --> 00:05:58.763]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:12.259]  The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, as summarized by the Senate Armed Services Committee, proposes a 25% reduction in generals and admirals across the board, reports the Daily Caller.
[00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:21.245]  A summary of the bill provided by the committee states the drawdown in general officers also applies at the 3, 2, and 1 star levels.
[00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:32.576]  The committee reasons that over the past 30 years, the in-strength of the joint force has decreased 38%, but the ratio of 4-star officers to the overall force has increased by 65%.
[00:06:32.876 --> 00:06:42.725]  The bill's summary explains that by making heavy cuts at the 3 and 4-star level, it can allow the services a broader base to develop future leaders.
[00:06:42.945 --> 00:06:46.589]  The summary also cites budget concerns as a reason for the reduction.
[00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:55.197]  Saying that the Pentagon must proactively work to shift as many personnel as possible from staff functions to operational and other vital roles.
[00:06:55.377 --> 00:06:59.281]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:00.682]  Brain Force is here.
[00:07:01.203 --> 00:07:03.505]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:07:03.765 --> 00:07:11.592]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:07:12.355 --> 00:07:15.937]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:07:15.957 --> 00:07:18.298]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:07:18.658 --> 00:07:22.180]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.361]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:07:25.861 --> 00:07:30.604]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:07:31.204 --> 00:07:33.025]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:07:33.365 --> 00:07:37.747]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:07:37.967 --> 00:07:40.008]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:42.069]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:42.350]  Exactly.
[00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.752]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:07:46.772 --> 00:07:54.777]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:08:12.862 --> 00:08:20.327]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:08:21.348 --> 00:08:25.250]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:29.513]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:08:29.873 --> 00:08:31.434]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.975 --> 00:08:41.561]  Take the children and yourself And hide out in the cellar By now the fighting will be cold
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:09:01.505]  Matt Drudge came out yesterday and told the head of Homeland Security, if you want us to turn our guns in, you say that's a matter of Homeland Security, turn your guns in.
[00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:05.827]  There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
[00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:08.368]  Use it only in emergency.
[00:09:08.388 --> 00:09:10.429]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:12.650]  In fact, the song continues on.
[00:09:17.012 --> 00:09:23.359]  Guns aren't going to save us in the final equation, but if they do get the guns, that's the final symbol of slavery.
[00:09:25.601 --> 00:09:31.628]  It's one of the final pieces in making us domesticated slaves with almost no chance of ever turning things around.
[00:09:31.648 --> 00:09:37.414]  And that's why tyrants have hunger.
[00:09:38.897 --> 00:09:40.258]  An instinct to disarm us.
[00:09:40.798 --> 00:10:02.232]  But it will be free speech and ideas and intellectual freedom that will lead the vanguard of the new renaissance and if the enemy then wants to offensively attack us, it will be guns and weapons in the physical war that will complete the circle and deliver us back into the good graces of liberty.
[00:10:02.252 --> 00:10:07.956]  And that's why today I thought I would just display this
[00:10:09.713 --> 00:10:11.734]  Flat black judge.
[00:10:12.374 --> 00:10:15.975]  I've been buying judges since Taurus came out with them 20 years ago.
[00:10:15.995 --> 00:10:19.396]  And I think I've probably got four or five of these.
[00:10:19.696 --> 00:10:22.497]  This is the self-defense weapon I tend to have around the house.
[00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:26.498]  Quick access, but that way you don't shoot through walls.
[00:10:27.558 --> 00:10:29.779]  That way you don't kill your neighbors.
[00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:35.441]  And you don't have to be as good a shot if you're half asleep or startled.
[00:10:36.441 --> 00:10:38.442]  The safest thing in your house is about a number seven.
[00:10:39.517 --> 00:10:42.419]  Here at the office, I may need a little bit more distance on somebody.
[00:10:42.479 --> 00:10:44.861]  I've got, what is it?
[00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:55.189]  Triple-aught buck, four .44 caliber pellets in each shotgun cartridge.
[00:10:55.429 --> 00:11:03.114]  And Taurus isn't a sponsor, though they should be, because for me, this is just a really great firearm.
[00:11:03.135 --> 00:11:03.995]  This is 1-2-2-5-0-0-0 Buck Remington.
[00:11:09.477 --> 00:11:19.464]  Ultimate home defense, and I've tested these out on wet foam books, and I've also tested these out on small game, and I have found this to be the best round.
[00:11:19.484 --> 00:11:24.767]  They've got a lot of other supposedly fancier ones that have different odd shapes and things or shoot darts out.
[00:11:24.847 --> 00:11:25.888]  That's all just a gimmick.
[00:11:26.348 --> 00:11:31.091]  You want to go with good old-fashioned buckshot because its philosophy is a lot higher.
[00:11:31.992 --> 00:11:37.593]  Unless, again, you're in your house and you want to go like a number seven, seven and a half, but up close it'll kill somebody dead in a hammer.
[00:11:38.293 --> 00:11:39.973]  And this is what it's all about.
[00:11:40.013 --> 00:11:45.074]  That way you don't shoot at somebody, it goes through them and then kills somebody on the other side.
[00:11:45.714 --> 00:11:50.935]  It just dissipates its force on the target and then you're done.
[00:11:53.896 --> 00:11:59.277]  And of course with a shotgun cartridge it dissipates not just because of there being more
[00:12:00.422 --> 00:12:01.202]  Alex Jones Show!
[00:12:01.222 --> 00:12:01.642]  We're good to go!
[00:12:30.663 --> 00:12:34.465]  and dissipate all its force inside their body, and then you are alive and they are dead.
[00:12:34.905 --> 00:12:43.228]  Imagine if the security guard, licensed to carry, hadn't turned and run in Orlando.
[00:12:43.348 --> 00:12:45.929]  Imagine if someone would have fired back.
[00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.090]  Imagine what would have happened.
[00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.611]  It doesn't matter if the person's wearing a bulletproof vest.
[00:12:52.032 --> 00:12:57.954]  You shoot at somebody with a shotgun, handgun, or shotgun rifle style,
[00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:05.964]  You aim towards their head, you're going to end up hitting them with some pellets, and they're not going to be in a position to continue to kill people.
[00:13:07.464 --> 00:13:11.086]  And that's the whole point of defending yourself.
[00:13:11.586 --> 00:13:18.729]  You shoot somebody with a 7mm mag, let's say, in that place, it's going to go through the body armor, through them, and out the back and hit somebody else.
[00:13:19.109 --> 00:13:26.612]  But again, I'm not even Mr. Firearms Expert, but compared to these disarmed slaves, I'm a completely different animal, completely different creature.
[00:13:28.911 --> 00:13:32.732]  And so again, I would just recommend that everyone go out and get a firearm.
[00:13:32.853 --> 00:13:39.575]  There is also a video that Tim Kennedy talked about yesterday, right at the end of the interview I did with him.
[00:13:40.015 --> 00:13:48.138]  And I'm going to ask one of our great editors, Darren McBreen, or whoever can do it, to real fast grab the last five minutes of the Tim Kennedy interview.
[00:13:48.518 --> 00:13:52.500]  And he brought up one of these BuzzFeed videos they're pushing.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.021]  The left is showing a leftist shooting a M4 or an AR-15.
[00:13:59.164 --> 00:14:01.086]  That basically has no kick.
[00:14:01.246 --> 00:14:03.068]  A five-year-old could shoot these all day.
[00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:10.796]  Now, if you held it totally listlessly, with no force, it might jerk a little bit into your shoulder.
[00:14:12.158 --> 00:14:20.727]  But they sell this perception that firearms are just these devastatingly, you know, dangerous, explosive things that no one can control.
[00:14:22.142 --> 00:14:30.704]  But somebody's not scared of a nail gun, or scared of a chainsaw, or scared of something else that, on average, you're going to get injured with a lot more often.
[00:14:30.984 --> 00:14:31.684]  A lawnmower.
[00:14:31.724 --> 00:14:35.225]  It's a big, spinning sling blade.
[00:14:35.305 --> 00:14:36.105]  Kaiser blade.
[00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:37.686]  I mean, super deadly.
[00:14:37.726 --> 00:14:38.826]  Chop your foot right off.
[00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:40.326]  Chop your toes right off.
[00:14:40.526 --> 00:14:41.206]  Happens all the time.
[00:14:41.226 --> 00:14:42.167]  It doesn't even make the news.
[00:14:43.027 --> 00:14:43.807]  It's just an accident.
[00:14:45.578 --> 00:14:47.259]  Firearms are built for safety.
[00:14:47.339 --> 00:14:50.380]  They fire a projectile out the front where you're aiming them.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:15:03.966]  If you just learn basic safety and get past the mystic awe and fear around it, we can win this culture war, but we've got to take trendies out and we've got to get them to be able to fire firearms and learn how to use them responsibly.
[00:15:04.326 --> 00:15:12.490]  That's why they're putting out all these videos, I've noticed, where people fire 223s, people fire
[00:15:17.725 --> 00:15:20.368]  I mean, I was firing .357 Magnums when I was six years old.
[00:15:20.388 --> 00:15:23.851]  The secret is you just hold it with a little bit of force and control in your hand, and it just kicks back.
[00:15:43.137 --> 00:15:45.898]  With the force of a puppy pushing its paw into you.
[00:15:45.998 --> 00:15:47.819]  I mean, it's just nothing.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.363]  And I will say, I've gone out and shot a hundred rounds of .50 cal before and not really paid attention and just done it like I'm relaxed.
[00:15:55.362 --> 00:15:57.783]  And then it, you know, kind of knocked my back out of play.
[00:15:57.803 --> 00:15:59.983]  But as long as you tense up when you're firing, it's not a problem.
[00:16:00.323 --> 00:16:12.847]  But that's different when you're holding some, you know, 50-pound Barrett naval, you know, version, or army version, and you're sitting there, you know, firing it over and over again.
[00:16:12.867 --> 00:16:14.547]  Yes, then you can have some issues.
[00:16:15.488 --> 00:16:23.070]  But it's just, a lot of folks, I tell them, I think the Judge is a great firearm because it's a legal shotgun cartridge.
[00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:41.255]  In a handgun, the equivalent of a sawed-off shotgun, and it's just a lot of power, and it's just versatile on so many fronts, it doesn't kill people on the other side of the wall unless you're shooting triple-aught buck or slugs, and there's almost no kick from this.
[00:16:42.529 --> 00:16:48.732]  I mean, my children at age 7 or 8 have gone out and fired these, even with slugs out in the country.
[00:16:49.412 --> 00:17:02.579]  And you just teach them to sit there and hold it with some force, have control, keep their finger off the trigger until they're ready, cock the firearm, aim at the target, pull the trigger.
[00:17:04.693 --> 00:17:09.674]  And then, forever, they are free of the anti-gun brainwashing cult.
[00:17:10.494 --> 00:17:14.975]  Now, I've already digressed into that, but I'm going to obviously get into the news on that front.
[00:17:15.896 --> 00:17:17.236]  They're coming for the Second Amendment.
[00:17:17.256 --> 00:17:21.257]  They want executive orders to ban semi-autos, to ban their manufacture, to ban their sale.
[00:17:21.397 --> 00:17:24.117]  Obama actually said it, as you know, two days ago, and again yesterday.
[00:17:24.398 --> 00:17:27.338]  We spent most of the first hour yesterday playing that clip, going over it.
[00:17:27.638 --> 00:17:29.779]  Now, Jay Johnson came out and said that
[00:17:31.129 --> 00:17:36.750]  It's Homeland Security's job, and that for Homeland Security and public safety, we must restrict firearms.
[00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:41.251]  And he said, because of growing American terrorism, the same quotes we heard out of Obama.
[00:17:41.571 --> 00:17:47.132]  They also want people to be put on a no-gun-by list, just like you're on a no-fly list.
[00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:53.074]  When they sit there and say, if you're on a no-fly list, we want you on the no-gun-by list, it's the same thing.
[00:17:53.394 --> 00:17:54.574]  No one knows how you're put on it.
[00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:56.512]  You can't get off of it.
[00:17:56.532 --> 00:18:05.616]  We had Tim Kennedy, top anti-terrorism expert, 15-year Special Forces, a lot of that in domestic anti-terrorism operations.
[00:18:05.656 --> 00:18:07.056]  I'll just stop right there, but that's known.
[00:18:08.537 --> 00:18:11.998]  Agreeing with me that it destroys due process, it's horrible, it's out of control.
[00:18:12.298 --> 00:18:13.299]  Johnson's pushing that too.
[00:18:13.659 --> 00:18:18.120]  And Drudge came out with the tweets, Drudge to DHS Secretary, give up your guns first.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:24.543]  The reason it's important when Drudge came here last year, and he said to Obama, give up your guns first.
[00:18:29.648 --> 00:18:40.557]  That became a meme, and then you saw other people like Ted Nugent pick it up, you saw Donald Trump pick it up, and now the general public's picked it up, because that's an idea that's unstoppable.
[00:18:40.977 --> 00:18:42.178]  Michael Moore has bodyguards.
[00:18:42.198 --> 00:18:43.519]  Hillary Clinton has bodyguards.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.642]  Steven Spielberg has armed bodyguards.
[00:18:46.662 --> 00:18:50.685]  They've all got former special forces commandos.
[00:18:50.725 --> 00:18:53.107]  They might be American, but most of those are conservative, so they're not.
[00:18:53.127 --> 00:18:57.371]  They're either Israeli or French, and, I mean, I've been to a lot of those people's houses.
[00:18:58.131 --> 00:18:58.992]  That's, who's there?
[00:19:00.771 --> 00:19:01.852]  Usually at least two of them.
[00:19:03.372 --> 00:19:09.415]  And they've got armed commandos protecting them.
[00:19:09.455 --> 00:19:14.017]  And most of the commandos Hollywood have, I guess, are foreign.
[00:19:14.317 --> 00:19:17.799]  Not even so much because they're not libertarian, they're conservative, because usually they're listeners.
[00:19:18.079 --> 00:19:23.622]  When I talk to them, even if they're French or Israeli or German or whatever, a lot of them are Israeli, I guess that's kind of cool in Hollywood.
[00:19:25.698 --> 00:19:29.082]  Hollywood hires foreign commandos because they don't like American soldiers.
[00:19:29.142 --> 00:19:30.163]  That's really what it comes down to.
[00:19:30.403 --> 00:19:34.147]  That's how anti-America the whole mindset is.
[00:19:34.467 --> 00:19:35.648]  Oh, we just don't have a lot of...
[00:19:36.616 --> 00:19:41.637]  I mean, former American Special Forces here just because they just don't, quote, service Hollywood.
[00:19:41.657 --> 00:19:42.417]  That's a side issue.
[00:19:43.118 --> 00:19:47.859]  Once everybody realizes that they've all got bodyguards, a lot of them at taxpayer expense, it's game over.
[00:19:48.299 --> 00:19:55.921]  They live in a total gun culture themselves, but just don't want us to be part of it because they want a bunch of domesticated slaves that they can totally control.
[00:19:56.941 --> 00:19:57.521]  It's that simple.
[00:20:11.022 --> 00:20:15.243]  Once upon a time, there was a dude named Prescott, last name Bush.
[00:20:15.563 --> 00:20:16.163]  Guess what?
[00:20:16.963 --> 00:20:19.224]  He helped run a bank, funding Nazis.
[00:20:19.264 --> 00:20:21.684]  Well, you'd think that Hitler got his tank money, Bobby.
[00:20:21.904 --> 00:20:24.505]  Hitler made a killin', and Prescott made a gillin'.
[00:20:24.525 --> 00:20:28.046]  Congratulations, the Bush family got millions.
[00:20:28.786 --> 00:20:31.526]  That's a lot of loot now, time to turn it up now.
[00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:32.887]  Ain't no turnin' back now.
[00:20:32.927 --> 00:20:35.427]  Prescott had a son, his name was Herbert Walker.
[00:20:35.627 --> 00:20:37.608]  Lil' Herbert Walker, he was slow.
[00:20:38.008 --> 00:20:39.388]  Messin' with the skull and bones.
[00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.792]  We're good to go.
[00:21:31.489 --> 00:21:32.430]  Incredible!
[00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:49.960]  On September 11th, Bush and the head of the Bin Laden family would be at the same Carlyle Group meeting in Washington, a few miles from where Osama Bin Laden's hijackers would attack the Pentagon.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.303]  Bush, King, and the PENAC Group gained everything they had wanted as a direct result of 9-11.
[00:21:56.803 --> 00:21:57.864]  And of course, U.S.
[00:21:58.064 --> 00:21:59.485]  oil and arms companies.
[00:22:00.023 --> 00:22:11.233]  Everyone, Obama and Trump, as well as the NRA and LGBT lobbyists, are saying the Orlando shooting requires new gun control measures because it's now an issue of national security.
[00:22:11.453 --> 00:22:14.536]  Democrats in Congress just ended a 15-hour filibuster.
[00:22:14.716 --> 00:22:20.742]  Republicans have caved and said they will hold a vote on whether to block people who have just been labeled a terrorist.
[00:22:20.902 --> 00:22:23.885]  Remember, this is secretly and without trial.
[00:22:24.146 --> 00:22:35.198]  People are put on terror watch lists and no-fly watch lists without their knowledge, without being told of the charges against them, without being able to confront their accusers in an open trial by jury.
[00:22:35.358 --> 00:22:38.702]  Now we're going to apply punishments and sanctions against them.
[00:22:38.942 --> 00:22:42.907]  This is a star chamber process that the Bill of Rights was written to stop.
[00:22:43.107 --> 00:22:45.730]  Terror attacks are not a gun control issue.
[00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.512]  They're a border control issue.
[00:22:47.652 --> 00:22:52.778]  Without background checks for migrants, terrorists are free to use nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.
[00:22:53.079 --> 00:22:56.823]  A rifle may be your only defense against that kind of weapon.
[00:22:57.043 --> 00:22:58.966]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:23:00.359 --> 00:23:07.520]  The Orlando mass murderer, who targeted homosexuals, was a regular at the Pulse nightclub, reports the London Guardian.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:13.702]  Customers had seen the killer there before, and several reported getting messages from him on gay dating apps.
[00:23:13.862 --> 00:23:15.922]  The FBI is investigating that claim.
[00:23:16.262 --> 00:23:25.224]  One patron said, sometimes he would go over in the corner and sit and drink by himself, and other times he would get so drunk he was loud and belligerent.
[00:23:25.444 --> 00:23:30.445]  We didn't really talk to him a lot, but I remember him saying things about his dad at times.
[00:23:30.605 --> 00:23:32.886]  He told us he had a wife and child.
[00:23:33.186 --> 00:23:40.628]  Jim Van Horn, age 71, told the Associated Press of Mateen, he was a homosexual and he was trying to pick up men.
[00:23:40.848 --> 00:23:44.668]  He would walk up to them and then maybe put his arm around them or something.
[00:23:44.829 --> 00:23:46.669]  That's what people do at gay bars.
[00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:54.038]  I think it's possible that he was trying to deal with his inner demons, trying to get rid of his anger of homosexuality, he added.
[00:23:54.238 --> 00:23:57.763]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:51.826 --> 00:25:53.787]  Lizard eating your child.
[00:25:53.887 --> 00:25:54.767]  See, that's sensational.
[00:25:55.267 --> 00:25:59.908]  Just like it's sensational that 49 people got killed in Orlando.
[00:25:59.928 --> 00:26:00.588]  And it is terrible.
[00:26:01.388 --> 00:26:02.409]  And it is happening.
[00:26:02.949 --> 00:26:08.390]  And it's a lot more dangerous than all the shark attacks in the world in the last 7-8 years.
[00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:11.611]  On average, there's about maybe 12-13 shark attack deaths a year.
[00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:19.831]  There might have been 50 gay people beaten to death in the last 20-30 years.
[00:26:21.931 --> 00:26:24.753]  You know, being mugged because of their sexual preference.
[00:26:25.673 --> 00:26:26.393]  49 died.
[00:26:27.594 --> 00:26:29.174]  And you don't hear a word about Islam.
[00:26:29.494 --> 00:26:33.196]  So it's all how they present things.
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:39.782]  And they're presenting it right now that it's the fault of the Second Amendment and Americans' rights.
[00:26:39.822 --> 00:26:45.384]  And I know you as an audience get this better than I do, but that's why I'm hammering Islam so hard.
[00:26:45.864 --> 00:26:50.185]  Because we can't just give it a pass and just hope the jihadis stop killing us.
[00:26:50.766 --> 00:26:51.546]  That's bad enough.
[00:26:52.927 --> 00:26:58.829]  But they're going to go find liberal victim disarmament zones where they feel safe to cowardly kill as many people as they can.
[00:26:58.849 --> 00:27:00.490]  They're not going to hit harder targets.
[00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:01.590]  Patriot targets.
[00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:04.692]  Look how it went for them at a conservative event in Dallas.
[00:27:04.972 --> 00:27:07.032]  Dead before they could even get out of their cars.
[00:27:09.253 --> 00:27:11.414]  Dead within seconds of starting to fire shots.
[00:27:11.894 --> 00:27:13.255]  Dead, dead, dead.
[00:27:14.901 --> 00:27:15.081]  No.
[00:27:15.802 --> 00:27:20.425]  We're not just talking about hundreds getting killed every year by Islamists now here in the United States.
[00:27:21.145 --> 00:27:26.369]  And thousands and thousands per country in the Middle East every month.
[00:27:27.109 --> 00:27:28.290]  Hundreds of thousands every year.
[00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:29.631]  And hundreds and hundreds in Europe.
[00:27:30.011 --> 00:27:30.371]  No, no, no.
[00:27:30.672 --> 00:27:36.596]  We're talking about them killing our right of free speech and killing our Second Amendment, the right to self-defense.
[00:27:36.816 --> 00:27:44.261]  And then killing our Fourth Amendment, saying none of us have any rights to privacy because they've got to protect us from the very jihadis the traitor government brought in.
[00:27:45.081 --> 00:27:47.905]  Jack Spratt could eat no fat, his wife could eat no lean.
[00:27:48.325 --> 00:27:50.748]  Between the two, they lick the platter clean.
[00:27:51.589 --> 00:27:55.815]  That's why I say the Jihadi's the magic, magic, magic skeleton key of the New World Order.
[00:27:57.947 --> 00:28:11.493]  The West brings them in, they get to make us be politically correct and submit to them, the terrorists attack, they get to take more of our rights, they get to have civil emergencies restricting our freedoms, in the name of countering the threat they brought in, all because of the death of logic.
[00:28:12.153 --> 00:28:13.554]  Merkel is to blame.
[00:28:13.874 --> 00:28:15.415]  Hollande is to blame.
[00:28:15.675 --> 00:28:17.316]  Hillary Clinton is to blame.
[00:28:17.556 --> 00:28:19.177]  Barack Obama is to blame.
[00:28:20.037 --> 00:28:24.319]  And the Republican leadership, going along with the open borders, is to blame.
[00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:32.514]  I am not to blame when I try to get on an airplane and they want to, after I go through the scanners and everything, want to touch my genitals.
[00:28:32.534 --> 00:28:35.456]  That's why I won't go through the naked body scanners, because I know they save the images.
[00:28:35.476 --> 00:28:37.097]  That was confirmed years after we documented it.
[00:28:37.317 --> 00:28:38.758]  But on top of that, it's all fake.
[00:28:38.958 --> 00:28:41.180]  So the former head of Homeland Security Chertoff makes money.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.721]  His company's made billions.
[00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:44.742]  He's made more than $30 million last time I checked.
[00:28:46.603 --> 00:28:50.506]  And then when Saudi Arabians come through, they don't even put them through the machines, because it's against their religion.
[00:28:51.926 --> 00:28:52.507]  It's a joke.
[00:28:53.769 --> 00:28:57.733]  And then even if you go through the scanner, a lot of times, they want you to go over and get groped some more!
[00:28:58.834 --> 00:29:02.197]  And, oh, let's check your bag to see if there's explosives.
[00:29:03.018 --> 00:29:08.763]  When they already ran my ID and put me through a database, and no, I haven't gotten a speeding ticket in like three years.
[00:29:11.766 --> 00:29:13.588]  They know full well.
[00:29:14.589 --> 00:29:17.632]  They've got an entire digital dossier on me.
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.026]  I've got to be trained.
[00:29:22.067 --> 00:29:23.778]  My children have to be trained how to be prisoners.
[00:29:24.642 --> 00:29:26.223]  As the border stays wide open.
[00:29:26.243 --> 00:29:30.464]  So I'm going to talk more about this attack on the Second Amendment and then tie it together.
[00:29:31.124 --> 00:29:32.545]  Oh, government documents released.
[00:29:32.645 --> 00:29:37.786]  Obama administration aided group that became ISIS to control area where ISIS formed the caliphate.
[00:29:38.647 --> 00:29:41.627]  We're going to get into NATO says it might now have grounds to attack Russia.
[00:29:41.728 --> 00:29:42.788]  Oh yes, this is official.
[00:29:43.048 --> 00:29:44.128]  This is really big.
[00:29:44.148 --> 00:29:49.130]  We'll look at a bunch of communist and socialist utopias that are currently collapsing into flames.
[00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.010]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:51.991]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:55.754]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:55.774 --> 00:29:58.035]  Special thanks for your footage that Jakari Jackson got.
[00:30:00.357 --> 00:30:09.384]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:30:09.444 --> 00:30:17.571]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.

[00:30:29.519 --> 00:30:36.604]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:30:36.704 --> 00:30:43.608]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[00:30:47.671 --> 00:30:48.091]  I'm disappointed.

[00:30:57.897 --> 00:30:59.579]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[00:31:01.468 --> 00:31:07.793]  I got so busy fighting the globalists for 15 years, I turned into a giant fat slob when I was an exercise fanatic before.
[00:31:08.213 --> 00:31:11.295]  Now in the last five years, I set out to try to get back in shape.
[00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:23.585]  And to help turbocharge that, I talked to top scientists and nutraceutical developers and said, I want something that blocks these estrogen mimickers, something that helps me get back to what a real male was like instead of this globalist bombardment.
[00:31:24.045 --> 00:31:26.926]  And we developed Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[00:31:27.106 --> 00:31:27.966]  They're best sellers.
[00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:29.506]  They're loved across the industry.
[00:31:29.686 --> 00:31:30.286]  They're amazing.
[00:31:30.546 --> 00:31:34.927]  You owe it to yourself to get a bottle of Super Male Vitality today at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:31:35.328 --> 00:31:38.388]  Folks, it's so amazing what Mother Nature gave us.
[00:31:38.668 --> 00:31:41.869]  You're crazy if you don't at least try a bottle of this, because you can't lose.
[00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:50.571]  You're fighting the InfoWare and the fight for freedom worldwide, while at the same time getting a game-changing supplement at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:31:50.731 --> 00:31:57.094]  The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, as summarized by the Senate Armed Services Committee, proposes a 25% reduction in generals and admirals across the board, reports the Daily Caller.
[00:31:57.114 --> 00:32:00.696]  A summary of the bill provided by the committee states the drawdown in general officers also applies at the three
[00:32:20.265 --> 00:32:33.248]  The committee reasons that over the past 30 years, the end strength of the joint force has decreased 38%, but the ratio of four-star officers to the overall force has increased by 65%.
[00:32:33.548 --> 00:32:43.391]  The bill's summary explains that by making heavy cuts at the three and four-star level, it can allow the services a broader base to develop future leaders.
[00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:47.232]  The summary also cites budget concerns as a reason for the reduction.
[00:32:47.512 --> 00:32:55.859]  Saying that the Pentagon must proactively work to shift as many personnel as possible from staff functions to operational and other vital roles.
[00:32:56.059 --> 00:32:59.862]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:20.381]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:21.962 --> 00:33:26.703]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.304 --> 00:33:30.665]  So they told us they were never coming after our guns.
[00:33:33.165 --> 00:33:40.948]  And then they brought in a bunch of incompatible people from the Middle East that have been killing each other for over a thousand years.
[00:33:43.163 --> 00:33:57.692]  And then they launched a worldwide Saudi Arabian and Western-backed Islamic offensive of terrorist attacks, sex slavery, and radicalization.
[00:33:58.692 --> 00:34:10.440]  And they shipped Stinger missiles and anti-tank missiles to them by the thousands and gave them billions of dollars and then had the nerve to protect
[00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:28.463]  These radical networks, these radical mosques, who openly get on TV and say to their practitioners, to their flock of weasels, go out and kill gays and kill single women having sex out of wedlock.
[00:34:31.653 --> 00:34:36.934]  And no one goes to jail, no one gets investigated, and the FBI is ordered to stand down.
[00:34:37.414 --> 00:34:43.875]  I'm living in the twilight zone, and let me tell you something, if you think this screw job you're living under is bad, yet, get ready.
[00:34:44.875 --> 00:34:50.056]  Because they have brought people in from the most backward third world, nut house countries.
[00:34:50.936 --> 00:34:56.617]  Where the people are so backstabbing and so psychotic, they can't even get their act together to have running water.
[00:34:57.878 --> 00:35:00.018]  Countries where they wipe their butts with their hand.
[00:35:01.496 --> 00:35:04.038]  Yes, that's why a Muslim will shake your hand with one hand, not the other.
[00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:06.139]  I'm not trying to be gross here.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:11.824]  I'm just telling you, these aren't industrialized Muslim nations they're bringing these people in from.
[00:35:11.844 --> 00:35:14.386]  They are bringing them in from Hillbilly Central.
[00:35:16.787 --> 00:35:23.232]  And they are here and they are flipping out when they walk into a movie theater and they've got men and women in the same bathroom.
[00:35:23.592 --> 00:35:24.573]  What do you think they're going to do?
[00:35:24.613 --> 00:35:25.414]  They're going to go nuts.
[00:35:25.754 --> 00:35:26.815]  They're going to go out to their car.
[00:35:26.855 --> 00:35:27.675]  They're going to get a knife.
[00:35:28.016 --> 00:35:29.597]  They're going to come in and start stabbing people.
[00:35:30.486 --> 00:35:41.599]  Or they're going to flip out and go get a gun and shoot people, and then I'll be blamed, you'll be blamed by the very leftist media combine that knows exactly what they're doing.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.765]  But I'm going to stop right there, because I want to get into some of this other news here in a moment.
[00:35:47.846 --> 00:35:48.227]  Briefly.
[00:35:50.071 --> 00:35:57.218]  I want all the listeners and viewers to know that I want to thank you for your support, spreading the word, sending out the videos, the articles.
[00:35:57.258 --> 00:36:01.962]  You're the reason that InfoWars is just really, when it comes to actually reaching people, exploding.
[00:36:03.744 --> 00:36:04.725]  But it's a paradox.
[00:36:04.745 --> 00:36:06.486]  There's a global depression in most areas.
[00:36:06.887 --> 00:36:10.610]  Our economy is really in a depression, though it's not evenly distributed, obviously.
[00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.753]  And the mainstream media does everything it can to cover that up.
[00:36:17.213 --> 00:36:22.757]  But when you do buy the products at Infowarsstore.com, all really great products and things that everybody needs.
[00:36:23.618 --> 00:36:37.207]  Water filtration systems, non-GMO, heirloom seeds, nutraceuticals, books, films, libertarian, patriot, Americana apparel that promotes a message of freedom and resistance to tyranny.
[00:36:37.267 --> 00:36:37.928]  It's all there.
[00:36:39.346 --> 00:36:44.671]  When you purchase products there, it makes what we do here completely and totally possible.
[00:36:45.652 --> 00:37:00.047]  So, Tim Kennedy has joined InfoWars to start promoting a weekly series on preparedness, on combat training, on HUMET, on identifying criminal operatives, jihadi operatives, you name it, in your area.
[00:37:01.769 --> 00:37:04.211]  It's great to have the top army soldier.
[00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:08.434]  He's recognized as like the top army soldier in every score.
[00:37:08.554 --> 00:37:14.599]  Fighting, combat, shooting, analysis, photography.
[00:37:14.619 --> 00:37:15.740]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.962]  It's great to have him advising and working with InfoWars now.
[00:37:19.523 --> 00:37:25.527]  And he is a big supporter of the products, Brain Force, Secret 12, Super Mental Vitality, the three products.
[00:37:26.028 --> 00:37:31.452]  He's got the anti-doping agency that oversees the UFC to approve him to take these.
[00:37:33.414 --> 00:37:36.297]  And he's just blown away by him.
[00:37:36.397 --> 00:37:38.919]  I mean, he kind of pooh-poohs a lot of other supplements.
[00:37:38.979 --> 00:37:40.580]  Supermill Vitality really blew him away.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.622]  He quite frankly said libido was the strongest thing.
[00:37:42.662 --> 00:37:49.248]  He's already right up there, you know, in the top one-tenth of one percent, but he said he did feel gains of strength, of recovery.
[00:37:50.919 --> 00:38:09.003]  He said, unlike any other workout enhancement herbal product out there, because we really did set out to make cold-pressed, concentrated, it's an oil, basically, the most pure, unadulterated, unpasteurized, it hasn't been heated, that's what's so important, product.
[00:38:09.063 --> 00:38:13.003]  It's like wine, but it's really a blend of essential oils and herbs.
[00:38:13.764 --> 00:38:19.445]  Supermale Vitality, Superfemale Vitality, I mean, it's got almost five-star reviews, thousands of reviews, it's like a 4.8.
[00:38:21.127 --> 00:38:21.928]  Third-party sites.
[00:38:22.008 --> 00:38:22.708]  It's so powerful.
[00:38:22.828 --> 00:38:27.152]  It's 15% off the Tim Kennedy special on Supermental Vitality, Brain Force, and Secret 12.
[00:38:27.192 --> 00:38:31.355]  You can get them all three together or get them separately.
[00:38:31.375 --> 00:38:33.517]  15% off.
[00:38:34.217 --> 00:38:36.980]  Again, but it's also 15% off on those individually.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.523]  You can also get free shipping on orders of $50 or more.
[00:38:42.084 --> 00:38:43.885]  And when you sign up for auto-ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:51.627]  Or if you want to support the broadcast, you know, don't sign up for that and help us get more money in here to get more reporters, more crew, more people.
[00:38:51.687 --> 00:39:00.217]  And we've got Joe Biggs, we've got Tim Kennedy on the military anti-terrorism front, we've got all these other great reporters who have expertise in different areas.
[00:39:00.798 --> 00:39:03.941]  We've got four or five more slots in the reporting area to fill.
[00:39:04.662 --> 00:39:07.443]  We need more camera people, we need more editors, we need more writers.
[00:39:07.463 --> 00:39:09.703]  I'm maxed out, though, financially.
[00:39:10.604 --> 00:39:14.205]  But every time I expand, we end up getting the support we need.
[00:39:14.225 --> 00:39:19.526]  So I'm just going to go ahead and spend our reserves, put everything all in, going through this election into next year.
[00:39:19.946 --> 00:39:21.407]  And if we have to downsize next year, we will.
[00:39:22.007 --> 00:39:22.847]  But I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:39:22.887 --> 00:39:23.748]  I think you're going to support us.
[00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:26.208]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:39:26.228 --> 00:39:28.369]  InfoWarsLife.com is the nutraceuticals.

[00:39:39.154 --> 00:39:45.456]  You get 50% offs for Melvitality, BrainForce, and Secret 12, that's Methylcobalamin and Vitamin B12, at InfoWarsLife.com right now for a limited time.
[00:39:45.736 --> 00:39:50.397]  These are the products that Tim Kennedy uses in his Special Forces and UFC training that help him go to the next level.
[00:39:50.437 --> 00:39:57.219]  He said it took him to the next level, which he said wasn't a huge next level, but very noticeable and real after working out six hours a day.
[00:39:58.582 --> 00:39:59.883]  The guy is a freak, by the way.
[00:40:00.443 --> 00:40:01.064]  That's well known.
[00:40:01.744 --> 00:40:08.408]  All three products have hundreds of five-star reviews and contain the known herbs that help boost the body naturally.
[00:40:09.522 --> 00:40:14.104]  Now is the time to stock up and get our top products 15% off at InfoWarsLive.com.

[00:40:35.454 --> 00:40:43.082]  We also have their great Alexa Pure Breeze, Air Purifier System, and so much more at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:40:43.222 --> 00:40:43.743]  Okay, I'm done.
[00:40:44.123 --> 00:40:45.505]  Done plugging except for this fact.
[00:40:47.034 --> 00:40:49.955]  Continue to spread the word about the local AM and FM stations you're on.
[00:40:50.175 --> 00:40:55.977]  Don't take that for granted that we're in a serious info war, and the globalists are doing everything they can to try to block this information.
[00:40:56.677 --> 00:41:05.760]  Spread the word, become a sponsor, let the sponsors know why you're supporting them, whether they're dry cleaners, or a car dealership, or whoever it is, or become a sponsor.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:18.148]  Or start your own show, or send them $100, or put the frequency of the station on the side of your business, or the side of your barn, or put an ad in the paper for the local station and tell them I'm doing this because you're carrying the Alex Jones Show.
[00:41:18.728 --> 00:41:21.470]  And chances are, if they're carrying this broadcast, they're carrying other good broadcasts.
[00:41:22.471 --> 00:41:24.372]  Man, I tell you, we're all in on this fight.
[00:41:24.412 --> 00:41:25.753]  I know a lot of you have done a lot of great things.
[00:41:26.133 --> 00:41:27.414]  There's no way for me to thank you all.
[00:41:27.474 --> 00:41:29.355]  I read your letters, I see your emails, I'm working.
[00:41:30.407 --> 00:41:35.292]  I'll be honest, I only work like 10-12 hours a day now that I'm 40-something and I got three children.
[00:41:35.673 --> 00:41:41.039]  Because I physically work 18 hours a day sometimes, but then it degrades my other work.
[00:41:41.259 --> 00:41:43.321]  I just work intensely and more focused now.
[00:41:47.543 --> 00:41:53.509]  I did work 18 hours a day for many years, and you saw it into my body, and so I just need to have a long run here.
[00:41:53.569 --> 00:42:10.506]  So I've cut back to a huge media load, probably one of the biggest media loads anybody has out there, but not the joke level when I used to do six hours a day on radio and a TV show, and basically even sometimes get in the shipping department and package packages myself.
[00:42:11.527 --> 00:42:18.312]  I mean, I started out doing that 20 years ago, making my first film, and I would sit there in my apartment, putting the VHS tapes in the package and mailing them out.
[00:42:18.732 --> 00:42:24.096]  But that's how I built from that base, totally zero, all the way up to what we're here at now.
[00:42:24.456 --> 00:42:34.703]  I have a responsibility to go for broke, be all in right now, to hit the globalists with broadside after broadside, forget the maneuvers and go straight at them.
[00:42:34.723 --> 00:42:37.024]  I'm going straight at them, and I'm counting on Providence.
[00:42:37.665 --> 00:42:39.746]  And it's been coming through, so thank you for your prayers as well.
[00:42:40.046 --> 00:42:40.647]  I'm praying for you.
[00:42:41.887 --> 00:42:49.291]  Okay, I got a bunch of Donald Trump clips that I've got to get to that are very powerful, but first I want to play this incredible statement here.
[00:42:49.691 --> 00:42:55.994]  CIA director tells Congress he's focused on diversity after Pulse Club massacre.
[00:42:56.014 --> 00:43:04.559]  So the answer is run around and have feel-good stuff about gay, gay, gay, and everything's wonderful, you know, when you're part of a team.
[00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:09.642]  And let's just propagandize everyone about how we should be nice to gay people.
[00:43:09.962 --> 00:43:15.607]  And somehow a radical Islamic extremist whose father gets on the YouTube every week and says, you know, kill the gays.
[00:43:15.647 --> 00:43:17.028]  And the guy's imam says kill the gays.
[00:43:17.308 --> 00:43:19.770]  The issue isn't, hey, we have people calling for murder.
[00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.212]  The issue is, oh, you're the cause celeb.
[00:43:22.232 --> 00:43:23.453]  That's like when breast cancer...
[00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:30.221]  Goes up almost 3,000% in the United States and every other Western country because glyphosate grows it, amongst other things.
[00:43:30.241 --> 00:43:32.644]  I mean, admittedly grows it, like miracle grow for tumors.
[00:43:32.944 --> 00:43:37.710]  You know, round up, it's in the water table, you might want to filter your water, or you might want to dial in a breast cancer, I don't know, it's your choice.
[00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:41.353]  It's hit my family, I mean, I got daughters, it just, it really makes me angry.
[00:43:42.014 --> 00:43:44.155]  And it's just an admitted fact, by the way.
[00:43:44.175 --> 00:43:45.095]  Miracle-Gro grows plants?
[00:43:45.115 --> 00:43:48.116]  Well, 5% it grows big, giant estrogen-based tumors.
[00:43:48.796 --> 00:43:49.897]  It looks like estrogen in the body.
[00:43:50.337 --> 00:43:51.277]  A very funky form of it.
[00:43:51.917 --> 00:43:53.038]  It tells weeds to die, folks.
[00:43:53.338 --> 00:43:55.519]  That's not a good... I know they told you you could drink it, it was pure malt.
[00:43:56.079 --> 00:44:01.901]  The lobbyist that started that 20 years ago was asked that on Canadian TV, and he said, of course I'm not going to drink that, am I crazy?
[00:44:01.921 --> 00:44:04.502]  I just say that to the idiots.
[00:44:08.274 --> 00:44:09.757]  I told you, it'll all be cause celeb.
[00:44:10.338 --> 00:44:12.602]  You say, what's breast cancer have to do with gays being killed?
[00:44:13.263 --> 00:44:15.928]  They don't ever ask, why is it exploding?
[00:44:15.969 --> 00:44:16.930]  And is everybody getting it?
[00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:18.032]  Even 12 year olds getting it.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:26.541]  They just say, let's find a cure, and then, oh, you know, it's pink day at the restaurant, you want to pay extra $10 for your food?
[00:44:26.621 --> 00:44:27.021]  No, I don't.
[00:44:27.502 --> 00:44:28.542]  Oh, you don't care about breast cancer?
[00:44:29.002 --> 00:44:29.202]  No.
[00:44:29.722 --> 00:44:33.903]  I know what's causing a lot of it, and I'm trying to warn people, and I'm really angry about it.
[00:44:34.063 --> 00:44:44.245]  And as a man, I don't like being hit with it and prostate cancer going up, and I don't like the fact that men have to basically do all this stuff to block estrogen, or we get female breasts.
[00:44:44.565 --> 00:44:46.505]  I don't like the fact that we're being messed with.
[00:44:47.626 --> 00:44:49.106]  I want to stop the source of it.
[00:44:50.276 --> 00:44:57.243]  Oh, but it's all, let's have a run for breast cancer, let's all wear pink, let's all wear pink ribbons, let's all remember our grandma that died.
[00:44:57.603 --> 00:45:00.185]  No, no, I want somebody else's grandma to not die.
[00:45:01.006 --> 00:45:03.929]  I had one grandmother die of cancer, my other grandmother has breast cancer.
[00:45:03.949 --> 00:45:07.913]  She's had it for four years, she's refusing to be operated on, I get it, she's 91 years old.
[00:45:08.253 --> 00:45:09.094]  The point is...
[00:45:11.544 --> 00:45:13.066]  That I want to stop it.
[00:45:13.386 --> 00:45:14.267]  I want to cut it back.
[00:45:14.387 --> 00:45:15.108]  I want to remove it.
[00:45:15.428 --> 00:45:20.093]  It's like back in the 50s, they had tranquilizers for women that would cause the babies to have short arms and legs.
[00:45:20.113 --> 00:45:20.473]  Remember that?
[00:45:21.514 --> 00:45:22.655]  They took it off the market.
[00:45:24.777 --> 00:45:28.941]  Imagine nowadays, if it came on the market today, what was the name of that famous tranquilizer?
[00:45:29.744 --> 00:45:43.108]  If it came on the market today, they would just have runs and jogs and galas and fundraisers and events to try to figure out the cure for people not having short arms and legs and giant heads and deformities.
[00:45:44.048 --> 00:45:46.209]  Instead, you just stop giving people the tranquilizer.
[00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:48.930]  But they're not taking the glyphosate out.
[00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:50.350]  No, no, no.
[00:45:50.851 --> 00:45:51.471]  No, sir.
[00:45:52.251 --> 00:45:55.132]  And they're not going to stop the Islamics going around and killing the homosexuals.
[00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:05.453]  They're gonna pistol-whip you politically and tell you how you somehow weren't nice, and you weren't tolerant, and how you've gotta go out and pledge your support to the Democratic Party.
[00:46:10.815 --> 00:46:11.596]  Thalidomide.
[00:46:11.856 --> 00:46:12.876]  Yeah, look up thalidomide.
[00:46:12.936 --> 00:46:21.479]  Sold under the brand name Imuprin, among others, and then it went on to cause massive birth defects.
[00:46:21.519 --> 00:46:23.280]  And in about five years, they figured it out and stopped it.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.901]  Hundreds of thousands of birth defects.
[00:46:26.806 --> 00:46:29.271]  Worldwide, it was what, 7,000 in the United States.
[00:46:29.512 --> 00:46:31.136]  But I'm going from memory, go read it for yourself.
[00:46:31.637 --> 00:46:37.149]  Now... We know what's causing a lot of the breast cancer.
[00:46:38.172 --> 00:46:39.532]  And see, that's how my little brain works.
[00:46:40.473 --> 00:46:43.933]  I see the CIA with a statement about, we're going to focus on diversity.
[00:46:44.253 --> 00:46:50.475]  All that's going to do is cause more people to get killed when you've got a bunch of people parading around and jumping around in front of jihadis.
[00:46:50.875 --> 00:46:57.977]  Why don't you, the CIA director, who is an admitted Wahhabist, who's converted to Islam, that's admitted, okay?
[00:46:58.277 --> 00:46:59.177]  Lived over there for many years.
[00:47:00.734 --> 00:47:02.175]  An Arabist, as they would say.
[00:47:02.195 --> 00:47:06.497]  This guy is saying we all need to just be more diverse.
[00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:10.899]  Why don't you tell the gay people to go over to Saudi Arabia and do that and then they get their heads chopped off.
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:11.860]  Oh no, no, no.
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.040]  He doesn't tell the Saudis to do that.
[00:47:13.341 --> 00:47:15.922]  He just, he just lectures us.
[00:47:15.962 --> 00:47:16.382]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:47:16.442 --> 00:47:17.623]  PubMed.gov.
[00:47:19.464 --> 00:47:23.206]  Glyphosate induces human breast cancer cells growth via estrogen receptors.
[00:47:24.206 --> 00:47:24.326]  Oh, 2013.
[00:47:24.406 --> 00:47:27.108]  They knew that 30 years ago when they approved that weapon.
[00:47:30.973 --> 00:47:34.716]  You know what grows big, fat, juicy brain tumors in all monkey species is given to it?
[00:47:35.937 --> 00:47:45.765]  You know what kills more than half the rhesus monkey babies when it's added in a regular dose that you get in Diet Coke to the me-ook in 1975 study?
[00:47:47.067 --> 00:47:48.388]  Aspartame.
[00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.971]  Equal.
[00:47:51.991 --> 00:47:54.653]  It'll equalize you alright.
[00:47:57.742 --> 00:47:59.003]  But they just changed the name.
[00:47:59.383 --> 00:48:02.706]  When he was the head of Searle, Rumsfeld couldn't get it approved.
[00:48:03.427 --> 00:48:05.209]  So then they just changed the name and got it approved in 1981.
[00:48:05.329 --> 00:48:12.054]  And it's killed tens of millions of people, just like Glyphosate has.
[00:48:12.114 --> 00:48:21.443]  But don't worry when your mommy or your daughter is in there getting radiated and dying from breast cancer, don't listen to the conspiracy theorists, okay?
[00:48:22.585 --> 00:48:27.988]  Because I was a little mean about how I talked about it, even though I personally have been hit by this and I'm sick of it.
[00:48:28.308 --> 00:48:31.390]  I have no right to try to save people or warn anyone.
[00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:33.871]  I just shut up, don't I?
[00:48:33.891 --> 00:48:45.098]  I'm that evil person that told you four and a half years ago our government was running al-Qaeda in Syria and was changing the name to ISIS a year before they did, and all the rest of it now confirmed, declassified, admitted.
[00:48:45.298 --> 00:48:50.821]  The truth is, I'm telling the truth, the truth is people can't handle the truth to quote
[00:48:52.452 --> 00:48:54.193]  That movie with Jack Nicholson.
[00:48:55.574 --> 00:48:56.254]  A few good men.
[00:48:58.255 --> 00:48:59.256]  You want answers?
[00:48:59.636 --> 00:49:01.497]  I'm here giving you answers!
[00:49:01.757 --> 00:49:05.619]  I'm giving you bibliographed proof in triplicate every day.
[00:49:05.779 --> 00:49:07.760]  The difference is, what are you going to do about it?
[00:49:11.042 --> 00:49:16.705]  So let's play as we go to break the CIA Director John Brennan.
[00:49:18.012 --> 00:49:26.108]  John Brennan, who's lived for decades in Saudi Arabia with those pervs, lecturing us about how he wants us to be diverse.
[00:49:26.348 --> 00:49:29.053]  This from the most hypocritical, it just makes me sick!
[00:49:29.094 --> 00:49:29.514]  Here it is.
[00:49:32.486 --> 00:49:33.467]  We have the John Brennan clip.
[00:49:33.787 --> 00:49:34.368]  Dun-dun-dun-dun.
[00:49:34.448 --> 00:49:39.253]  A key part of this mindset is our commitment to making our workforce as diverse as the world we cover.
[00:49:40.073 --> 00:49:48.341]  Just last week, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a report showing that the intelligence community is significantly less diverse than the rest of the federal workforce.
[00:49:49.062 --> 00:49:55.729]  This report that forces those of us in the intelligence community to confront some hard truths about who we are and how we are performing our mission.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:07.691]  As this committee knows, CIA recently unveiled a landmark effort to make sure that our workforce reflects, in our attitudes, our backgrounds, our ethnicities, and our perspectives, the nation we work so hard to defend.
[00:50:07.711 --> 00:50:10.534]  This is both a moral and a mission imperative.
[00:50:11.195 --> 00:50:17.421]  I truly believe that the business case for diversity is stronger for CIA than it is for any other organization in the U.S.
[00:50:17.441 --> 00:50:17.741]  government.
[00:50:18.635 --> 00:50:30.610]  Diversity not only gives us the cultural understanding we need to operate in any corner of the globe, it also helps us avoid groupthink, ensuring we bring to bear a range of perspectives on the complex challenges that are inherent to intelligence.
[00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:31.191]  Well, that's enough!
[00:50:31.707 --> 00:50:34.770]  Okay, when he says groupthink, they're not allowed to say radical Islam, even.
[00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:35.871]  So that's total groupthink.
[00:50:36.071 --> 00:50:37.652]  They're not allowed to target any of the real people.
[00:50:37.912 --> 00:50:43.637]  The father of this guy was brought in by the CIA, it's now admitted, and visited Obama at the White House.
[00:50:44.058 --> 00:50:51.604]  And his brother-in-law runs bringing the so-called immigrants in, the invaders in, the migrants.
[00:50:51.624 --> 00:50:53.546]  I mean, he's the proper groupthink word.
[00:50:53.926 --> 00:50:58.670]  And then his answers just have little pink triangles all over the CIA, and that'll stop it.
[00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:59.531]  What a sick joke!
[00:51:00.748 --> 00:51:07.910]  The Orlando mass murderer, who targeted homosexuals, was a regular at the Pulse nightclub, reports the London Guardian.
[00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:14.112]  Customers had seen the killer there before, and several reported getting messages from him on gay dating apps.
[00:51:14.252 --> 00:51:16.333]  The FBI is investigating that claim.
[00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:25.616]  One patron said, sometimes he would go over in the corner and sit and drink by himself, and other times he would get so drunk he was loud and belligerent.
[00:51:25.836 --> 00:51:30.838]  We didn't really talk to him a lot, but I remember him saying things about his dad at times.
[00:51:31.018 --> 00:51:33.279]  He told us he had a wife and child.
[00:51:33.579 --> 00:51:41.022]  Jim Van Horn, age 71, told the Associated Press of Mateen, he was a homosexual and he was trying to pick up men.
[00:51:41.242 --> 00:51:45.083]  He would walk up to them and then maybe put his arm around them or something.
[00:51:45.243 --> 00:51:47.064]  That's what people do at gay bars.
[00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:54.437]  I think it's possible that he was trying to deal with his inner demons, trying to get rid of his anger of homosexuality, he added.
[00:51:54.637 --> 00:51:58.163]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[00:53:11.042 --> 00:53:13.143]  I don't think so.
[00:53:47.651 --> 00:53:51.889]  If I was just gonna, like, attach an idea to it, it's gonna be dangerous freedom.
[00:54:14.605 --> 00:54:21.628]  So, John Brennan, who's lived over a decade in Saudi Arabia and Riyadh, I mean, is just swapping spit with the royal family.
[00:54:21.688 --> 00:54:22.489]  Total insider.
[00:54:23.609 --> 00:54:27.511]  They're gonna put up some pink triangles and hire, quote, more gay people at the CIA.
[00:54:27.551 --> 00:54:30.212]  That'll stop the jihadis they brought in from killing us.
[00:54:32.433 --> 00:54:36.435]  But he goes on to admit to Congress, we haven't reduced ISIS terror reach and capacity.
[00:54:37.874 --> 00:54:38.715]  CNN had a clip of that.
[00:54:39.075 --> 00:54:41.037]  No, here's the memo received by Clinton.
[00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:47.424]  Obama admin aided group that became ISIS to control area where ISIS formed caliphate.
[00:54:48.705 --> 00:54:50.767]  And the Defense Department's put out memos, you name it.
[00:54:51.067 --> 00:54:55.272]  This is all admitted in a secret classified intel report that we've been telling you about for years.
[00:54:58.641 --> 00:55:03.002]  I mean, I'm not bragging, I just hear it from us four or five years before, but there it is from Breitbart.
[00:55:03.642 --> 00:55:06.563]  These people are running this, they're giving them weapons drops.
[00:55:07.123 --> 00:55:11.364]  The Iraqi government for three years has been saying, you're running ISIS, you're running Al-Qaeda.
[00:55:12.465 --> 00:55:16.326]  Anderson Cooper supported these groups taking over Egypt, remember?
[00:55:16.906 --> 00:55:22.227]  When they were blowing up churches and crucifying Christians, they were calling them revolutionaries and CNN wouldn't cover it.
[00:55:23.008 --> 00:55:23.988]  Cooper is CIA.
[00:55:25.762 --> 00:55:26.743]  And I want to explain something.
[00:55:26.803 --> 00:55:29.905]  I'm not even saying the CIA itself is what's bad.
[00:55:31.387 --> 00:55:38.872]  It's just this big unaccountable group operating since 1947 on its own with criminal elements running it.
[00:55:39.793 --> 00:55:40.434]  Like Spectre.
[00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:42.211]  That's what it is.
[00:55:42.231 --> 00:55:44.032]  I mean, we are just wide open.
[00:55:44.272 --> 00:55:47.015]  We've been conquered by whatever criminal groups run it.
[00:55:47.255 --> 00:55:48.536]  And they do whatever they want.
[00:55:48.596 --> 00:55:54.362]  And the propaganda they have for the schools is mommy and daddy is bad, private property is bad, your guns are bad.
[00:55:54.682 --> 00:56:00.307]  You want to see what the Ford Foundation, Carnegie Foundation that runs the CIA and other groups is about?
[00:56:00.447 --> 00:56:01.328]  Look at the news.
[00:56:01.768 --> 00:56:03.210]  Look at what they want to do to us.
[00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:04.571]  They are our enemy.
[00:56:04.851 --> 00:56:07.513]  They are a VC French occupying group.
[00:56:08.513 --> 00:56:13.015]  And again, the VC French were the people that sold out to Hitler before he invaded, and then became the government two weeks later.
[00:56:14.916 --> 00:56:16.277]  These are traitors, folks.
[00:56:16.297 --> 00:56:22.100]  They're sold out to the Chinese government, the communist, the radical Islamists, the Saudis.
[00:56:23.161 --> 00:56:25.682]  And so they're now trying to pass laws to shut us up!
[00:56:25.942 --> 00:56:27.223]  To shut patriots up!
[00:56:27.863 --> 00:56:31.065]  Homeland Security says its number one enemy is returning veterans and gun owners.
[00:56:31.265 --> 00:56:33.626]  Their whole preparation is to fight conservative governors!
[00:56:34.386 --> 00:56:35.987]  Because it's a foreign takeover!
[00:56:36.207 --> 00:56:37.168]  That isn't rhetoric!
[00:56:38.339 --> 00:56:44.366]  And by the way, the good news is 95% of Special Forces knows that we have foreign elements running our government.
[00:56:44.586 --> 00:56:46.008]  They know we're an occupied nation.
[00:56:46.448 --> 00:56:47.469]  Government within a government.
[00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:49.031]  They understand the score.
[00:56:49.552 --> 00:56:53.216]  And they finally, four and a half years ago, said we're not going to aid Al Qaeda.
[00:56:53.316 --> 00:56:53.736]  It's over.
[00:56:54.659 --> 00:57:01.221]  And the split was huge, so Obama has fired thousands of different people in the brass, and they are putting people in who were secretaries and things.
[00:57:01.941 --> 00:57:06.342]  And a bunch of weirdos from Harvard who've never been in combat, and all sorts, I mean, good!
[00:57:06.522 --> 00:57:12.384]  This is a total group of evil people that will cause total disrespect in the military, and their days are numbered.
[00:57:13.584 --> 00:57:17.285]  Now the danger is, though, they've never been in wars, so they're starting wars with Russia now.
[00:57:19.036 --> 00:57:20.116]  We're going to cover this coming up.
[00:57:20.797 --> 00:57:27.399]  So I say, you know, thank God if they start a civil war with us, they're run by a bunch of potential pushers and, you know, weirdos.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:36.843]  But at the same time, they're starting a war with Russia up against their borders in three different areas, starting a war with them, sending in proxy armies.
[00:57:36.903 --> 00:57:38.063]  And now NATO has come out.
[00:57:38.263 --> 00:57:39.504]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:57:39.884 --> 00:57:42.225]  NATO says it might now have grounds to attack Russia.
[00:57:43.649 --> 00:57:46.731]  That's from Infowars.com, going off the NATO announcements.
[00:57:47.091 --> 00:57:56.578]  Then there's, say what, NATO could use controversial, could use conventional weapons to respond to cyber attacks, and is now saying a cyber attack on anything in the U.S.
[00:57:57.219 --> 00:57:59.881]  or any other infrastructure in Europe will be called an act of war by Russia.
[00:57:59.901 --> 00:58:02.482]  They'll just claim Russia did it, and then attack Russia.
[00:58:03.123 --> 00:58:04.504]  So this is huge developments.
[00:58:05.384 --> 00:58:06.565]  We're going to break all that down.
[00:58:07.526 --> 00:58:11.249]  Jakari Jackson's in here at the bottom of the next hour, but before that, I'm going to play this clip.
[00:58:12.014 --> 00:58:13.195]  Probably about 8 after or so.
[00:58:13.475 --> 00:58:14.617]  That is just amazing.
[00:58:14.917 --> 00:58:16.338]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:58:16.498 --> 00:58:18.000]  Video.
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:21.903]  16-year-old black Trump supporter schools leftist in epic debate.
[00:58:22.324 --> 00:58:24.246]  That's a great headline, but it's not even good enough.
[00:58:24.266 --> 00:58:30.752]  16-year-old black Trump supporter schools black lives matter moron in epic debate.
[00:58:32.079 --> 00:58:37.861]  And we're changing that headline right now because this Black Lives Matter person is just the perfect Hillary supporter.
[00:58:38.061 --> 00:58:40.322]  Dumber, more ignorant than you can imagine.
[00:58:40.402 --> 00:58:42.602]  I mean, it's just like the Mark Dice videos.
[00:58:42.642 --> 00:58:44.063]  We're not just cherry-picking this.
[00:58:44.083 --> 00:58:45.643]  This is who these people are.
[00:58:50.413 --> 00:58:57.598]  The Orlando mass murderer who targeted homosexuals was a regular at the Pulse nightclub, reports the London Guardian.
[00:58:57.799 --> 00:59:03.783]  Customers had seen the killer there before and several reported getting messages from him on gay dating apps.
[00:59:03.943 --> 00:59:06.005]  The FBI is investigating that claim.
[00:59:06.345 --> 00:59:15.292]  One patron said, sometimes he would go over in the corner and sit and drink by himself and other times he would get so drunk he was loud and belligerent.
[00:59:15.492 --> 00:59:20.513]  We didn't really talk to him a lot, but I remember him saying things about his dad at times.
[00:59:20.673 --> 00:59:22.954]  He told us he had a wife and child.
[00:59:23.254 --> 00:59:30.696]  Jim Van Horn, age 71, told the Associated Press of Mateen, he was a homosexual and he was trying to pick up men.
[00:59:30.916 --> 00:59:34.736]  He would walk up to them and then maybe put his arm around them or something.
[00:59:34.897 --> 00:59:36.737]  That's what people do at gay bars.
[00:59:37.077 --> 00:59:44.106]  I think it's possible that he was trying to deal with his inner demons, trying to get rid of his anger of homosexuality, he added.
[00:59:44.306 --> 00:59:47.930]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:59:52.155 --> 00:59:54.779]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.206 --> 01:00:05.489]  You're looking on the screen as a TV viewer.
[01:00:05.509 --> 01:00:08.252]  Across the world, you see the image of InfoWars.
[01:00:08.312 --> 01:00:09.773]  You see the text.
[01:00:09.874 --> 01:00:11.295]  You are the resistance.
[01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:15.880]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.881]  Those aren't just words.
[01:00:17.562 --> 01:00:18.243]  We're doing it.
[01:00:20.054 --> 01:00:21.475]  We're reaching out to the military.
[01:00:22.175 --> 01:00:23.796]  We're reaching out to the security services.
[01:00:23.836 --> 01:00:28.597]  We're giving them the full spectrum analysis which is just common sense.
[01:00:28.938 --> 01:00:33.860]  They're looking into our research and concurring with it and taking the research to the next level.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.262]  But of course a lot of people in the government and corporations knew what was happening before I did.
[01:00:40.802 --> 01:00:47.285]  I was just crazy enough to go on air and talk about it and make films and aggressively prosecute an info war.
[01:00:49.258 --> 01:00:58.296]  When we have caused, you have caused the real muscle of this operation, and the humat, and the eyes and ears, and the brains, and the guts and everything else, and the feet.
[01:01:00.194 --> 01:01:00.554]  Blood.
[01:01:01.254 --> 01:01:02.214]  You are the resistance.
[01:01:02.254 --> 01:01:03.555]  You are the full-body politic.
[01:01:04.235 --> 01:01:08.175]  We have just absolutely chewed them up, man.
[01:01:08.656 --> 01:01:11.056]  They got bites and stab wounds and holes.
[01:01:11.436 --> 01:01:12.336]  They're bleeding out.
[01:01:12.396 --> 01:01:14.477]  They are just trying to fail forward.
[01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:16.837]  Hillary's trying to crawl into the presidency.
[01:01:17.937 --> 01:01:20.678]  Kelsey's all hopped up on drugs, about to collapse any moment.
[01:01:20.698 --> 01:01:21.598]  Completely insane.
[01:01:21.618 --> 01:01:23.918]  I mean, we got these squirrels scared.
[01:01:24.458 --> 01:01:25.619]  And we're just surging.
[01:01:26.859 --> 01:01:27.319]  We're committed.
[01:01:28.444 --> 01:01:30.347]  And there's no backing down, there's no turning around.
[01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.571]  It's a good feeling.
[01:01:33.928 --> 01:01:40.830]  It's sick when you look at how evil the enemy is and how twisted and how dishonorable they are, but I've just got to control myself and not look too closely.
[01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:47.312]  I've got to just coldly look at what they're doing, analyze it and resist it, and then have my passion for victory and feel good.
[01:01:47.332 --> 01:02:03.137]  I've got to get my morale up, even though, because we're having a lot of victories, but I just, they're so sickening and so degenerate and such a joke and so weak and the gaggles of fawning pimps and minions and sycophants that can't follow these traitors.
[01:02:04.057 --> 01:02:17.703]  Makes me just absolutely get in a very nasty mood, and I'm really working through it to be in a happy mood, because we are kicking their ass, just to move forward.
[01:02:18.904 --> 01:02:19.984]  I also know why I'm angry.
[01:02:20.464 --> 01:02:26.047]  I know how dangerous they are, and my flesh doesn't like messing with these dangerous people at a certain level.
[01:02:27.455 --> 01:02:29.436]  And so I get mad that they make me fight them.
[01:02:29.596 --> 01:02:36.218]  I get mad they make me sit here and savagely attack them and just engage in vicious information warfare against them.
[01:02:37.939 --> 01:02:40.600]  And just push them and attack them and bite them.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.781]  And because believe me, they come right back at us, folks.
[01:02:43.881 --> 01:02:47.162]  And I just, it's just... I just cannot stand them.
[01:02:47.182 --> 01:02:48.462]  I mean, that's really what it comes down to.
[01:02:50.703 --> 01:02:56.025]  And I see the trail of bodies and the trail of souls, the trail of dreams they've destroyed.
[01:02:57.159 --> 01:02:58.080]  These dream catchers.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.563]  And I just... They're demons, folks.
[01:03:00.623 --> 01:03:05.628]  They're absolute manifest pit of hell.
[01:03:06.209 --> 01:03:06.969]  Everything I hate.
[01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:08.851]  And at a gut level.
[01:03:13.076 --> 01:03:19.663]  My whole body, my whole soul just goes... I just want to overrun them.
[01:03:22.042 --> 01:03:23.764]  Because I know they're out to get everybody.
[01:03:23.844 --> 01:03:24.744]  I know their spirit.
[01:03:24.824 --> 01:03:25.825]  I can smell it.
[01:03:25.905 --> 01:03:26.526]  I can taste it.
[01:03:26.566 --> 01:03:27.207]  I can see it.
[01:03:27.947 --> 01:03:28.688]  I can feel it.
[01:03:28.708 --> 01:03:33.532]  And it's just like, oh, just, oh my God, you're evil.
[01:03:34.032 --> 01:03:40.038]  You child molesting, demonic pig creatures.
[01:03:41.929 --> 01:03:52.333]  And I see you, I know you of old, and I just can feel the epic battle rising as the energies ramp up for the big main event.
[01:04:00.095 --> 01:04:08.418]  And anybody else with any sense, any discernment, can see it, can feel it.
[01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:13.870]  And knows it, and can physically see it manifesting in front of us.
[01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:17.811]  So, start your engines for the next 25 minutes before Ja'Kari Jackson comes in.
[01:04:18.971 --> 01:04:22.052]  I am going to get to everything I haven't hit yet.
[01:04:23.033 --> 01:04:24.773]  And a bunch of powerful clips we need to go to.
[01:04:24.793 --> 01:04:27.374]  16-year-old black Trump supporter.
[01:04:27.414 --> 01:04:27.854]  Schools.
[01:04:29.554 --> 01:04:31.775]  Moronic Black Lives Matter minion.
[01:04:33.335 --> 01:04:33.876]  Dan Rather.
[01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:34.776]  Oh, this is incredible.
[01:04:34.796 --> 01:04:35.416]  This is incredible.
[01:04:35.456 --> 01:04:36.056]  This is incredible.
[01:04:36.216 --> 01:04:38.437]  I'm going to tell you about Dan Rather first when we come back.
[01:04:39.913 --> 01:04:42.354]  And what he said and what he did, this is simply amazing.
[01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:48.136]  It's up on InfoWars.com, but I'm going to put it up there under a specific headline because this is a pretty big deal.
[01:04:48.156 --> 01:04:52.818]  And then we're going to get to a lot of other key reports here.
[01:04:52.838 --> 01:04:57.740]  I have some criticism of the police and their policies.
[01:05:00.754 --> 01:05:07.076]  I got so busy fighting the Globals for 15 years, I turned into a giant fat slob when I was an exercise fanatic before.
[01:05:07.496 --> 01:05:10.598]  Now in the last five years, I set out to try to get back in shape.
[01:05:11.018 --> 01:05:22.862]  And to help turbocharge that, I talked to top scientists and nutraceutical developers and said, I want something that blocks these estrogen mimickers, something that helps me get back to what a real male was like instead of this Globals bombardment.
[01:05:23.422 --> 01:05:26.223]  We developed Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[01:05:26.403 --> 01:05:27.263]  They're best sellers.
[01:05:27.463 --> 01:05:28.804]  They're loved across the industry.
[01:05:28.964 --> 01:05:29.584]  They're amazing.
[01:05:29.844 --> 01:05:34.226]  You owe it to yourself to get a bottle of Super Male Vitality today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:34.606 --> 01:05:37.667]  Folks, it's so amazing what Mother Nature gave us.
[01:05:37.947 --> 01:05:41.168]  You're crazy if you don't at least try a bottle of this, because you can't lose.
[01:05:41.388 --> 01:05:49.871]  You're fighting the Info War and the fight for freedom worldwide, while at the same time getting a game-changing supplement at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:50.011 --> 01:05:52.233]  Super Metal Vitality is now back in stock.
[01:05:52.473 --> 01:05:53.994]  It's been sold out for several months.
[01:05:54.215 --> 01:05:59.459]  That's available at MFORSTORE.COM or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:05:59.699 --> 01:06:00.700]  Brain Force is here.
[01:06:01.241 --> 01:06:03.523]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:06:03.783 --> 01:06:11.589]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:15.953]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[01:06:15.973 --> 01:06:18.315]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:22.198]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:06:22.238 --> 01:06:25.380]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:30.684]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:06:31.225 --> 01:06:33.046]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:37.850]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:40.011]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:06:40.612 --> 01:06:42.073]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:06:42.233 --> 01:06:42.473]  Exactly.
[01:06:42.493 --> 01:06:46.256]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:06:46.797 --> 01:06:54.804]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:06:59.577 --> 01:07:02.518]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:07:02.798 --> 01:07:12.402]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:57.314]  Another world.
[01:07:57.334 --> 01:07:57.974]  Another time.
[01:07:58.054 --> 01:08:02.577]  In the age of wonder.
[01:08:02.677 --> 01:08:04.038]  In the age of wonder.
[01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:20.558]  Another tie.
[01:08:20.658 --> 01:08:26.040]  Another tie.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.981]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:08:32.681 --> 01:08:38.603]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:42.844 --> 01:08:43.804]  Alright, end this hour.
[01:08:45.186 --> 01:08:49.287]  We were one of the first to actually get this and report this yesterday.
[01:08:49.607 --> 01:08:50.748]  Proud of Mikhail Phelan's work.
[01:08:50.768 --> 01:08:52.308]  It got linked up on DrugsReport.com.
[01:08:53.188 --> 01:08:56.809]  Hacker releases secret Clinton docs from the State Department.
[01:08:56.889 --> 01:09:00.671]  DNC Trump opposition file donor list.
[01:09:00.711 --> 01:09:01.351]  And I've looked at it.
[01:09:01.391 --> 01:09:02.151]  It looks accurate.
[01:09:03.151 --> 01:09:06.472]  And so far, at least as of this morning, they're saying that they believe it's real.
[01:09:06.732 --> 01:09:07.513]  This is Guccifer 2.0.
[01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:11.106]  Some are claiming that it's the Russians.
[01:09:11.306 --> 01:09:23.690]  Well, I just say more power to them because it was the Russians that exposed the carbon tax fraud with over a thousand universities coordinating with each other to, quote, hide the decline in temperature in the last seven years.
[01:09:23.730 --> 01:09:24.710]  And that was six years ago.
[01:09:25.751 --> 01:09:26.931]  So that's coming up.
[01:09:26.951 --> 01:09:28.311]  We're about to play a clip video.
[01:09:28.351 --> 01:09:29.912]  Sixteen-year-old black Trump supporter.
[01:09:30.352 --> 01:09:32.673]  Schools, leftists, black lives matter.
[01:09:33.353 --> 01:09:33.833]  Ding dong.
[01:09:34.994 --> 01:09:38.415]  Dallas Police Department is practicing riot control ahead of Donald Trump's visit.
[01:09:41.525 --> 01:09:47.708]  So, we're going to have reporters up there tonight covering that event.
[01:09:47.868 --> 01:10:00.613]  And in my experience, when I've had anti-Federal Reserve rallies and things, we've had more opposition from leftists in Dallas than I've even gotten in Denver, Colorado and New York City.
[01:10:01.734 --> 01:10:03.294]  Or San Antonio or Houston.
[01:10:03.594 --> 01:10:05.595]  Because I've protested the Fed in all those places.
[01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:06.836]  The private run for private Fed.
[01:10:07.216 --> 01:10:09.117]  I mean, I've had them really come after us in Dallas.
[01:10:10.532 --> 01:10:20.060]  So, privately, I had a bet in here, and I'll just say it now, with Tim Kennedy, that I was like, no, I don't think San Antonio is where it's going to happen.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.000]  Of course, Trump cancelled that.
[01:10:22.902 --> 01:10:24.143]  It's going to be Dallas.
[01:10:25.204 --> 01:10:28.486]  And I'm not saying it's going to be that out of control, because the Dallas police are pretty serious.
[01:10:31.109 --> 01:10:32.570]  They didn't mess with us too much.
[01:10:35.418 --> 01:10:42.280]  When we had our JFK event for the 40th anniversary, because they banned protesting, the city had, but I still went and demanded to do it and threatened to sue.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.641]  But then they called in the county to attack us.
[01:10:45.781 --> 01:10:47.522]  That's a famous video for no reason.
[01:10:48.142 --> 01:10:50.923]  I mean, the police were leaving us alone at a Federal Reserve demonstration.
[01:10:51.263 --> 01:10:53.683]  Then this lady came and said, you can't protest without a permit.
[01:10:54.043 --> 01:10:54.824]  I said, I'm going to do it.
[01:10:54.844 --> 01:10:56.104]  She goes, the riot police are coming.
[01:10:56.764 --> 01:10:58.125]  And I said, we've already been out here two hours.
[01:10:58.165 --> 01:10:59.045]  Everybody, let's just leave.
[01:11:00.305 --> 01:11:01.806]  We just showed you on video doing that.
[01:11:02.266 --> 01:11:04.428]  And again, I'm not out to get the police themselves.
[01:11:04.448 --> 01:11:05.548]  I don't just hate the police.
[01:11:06.129 --> 01:11:07.790]  But leave the First Amendment alone.
[01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:08.651]  Leave the second alone.
[01:11:08.671 --> 01:11:11.853]  And when you get orders to violate it, don't go along with it.
[01:11:11.913 --> 01:11:16.676]  I mean, all over the country, I watch leftist groups, Black Lives Matter, you name it, attack police.
[01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:21.099]  And they're ordered to stand there and take it because these cities are run by a bunch of globalists.
[01:11:22.008 --> 01:11:28.491]  But then we're trying to get permits in Cleveland, officially with Roger Stone, and we have that group coming on next hour.
[01:11:28.511 --> 01:11:31.112]  They want me to be an added plaintiff for the lawsuit, and I am going to be.
[01:11:31.132 --> 01:11:37.014]  And they're just saying, oh, you can have a couple hours, you know, twice over, miles away, where nobody can see you in a free speech zone.
[01:11:37.975 --> 01:11:39.175]  Well, no, we're going to sue you.
[01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:47.059]  So, you know, a lot of times the police are put in the middle of this, though, and the police will say, well, go change it, or sue the city, or, you know, go to city council.
[01:11:47.259 --> 01:11:48.159]  We're just following orders.
[01:11:48.659 --> 01:11:49.640]  Yeah, but Nuremberg.
[01:11:52.072 --> 01:11:53.333]  The Nuremberg Precept.
[01:11:53.653 --> 01:11:54.995]  At a certain point you gotta say no.
[01:11:55.375 --> 01:11:58.718]  Just like the military said no four and a half years ago to aiding Al Qaeda.
[01:11:58.778 --> 01:11:59.579]  It was just too much.
[01:11:59.959 --> 01:12:01.181]  We're not giving them Stinger missiles.
[01:12:01.201 --> 01:12:02.282]  We're not giving them TOW missiles.
[01:12:02.542 --> 01:12:03.463]  We know you've already done it.
[01:12:03.783 --> 01:12:04.784]  We know about Benghazi.
[01:12:04.804 --> 01:12:05.405]  We're not doing this.
[01:12:07.546 --> 01:12:09.907]  So, that's what's going to save us from saying no.
[01:12:09.927 --> 01:12:12.908]  And then they can't just target one good cop or one good soldier.
[01:12:12.948 --> 01:12:15.229]  At a certain point, all of us have to say no.
[01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.970]  I've said no.
[01:12:16.690 --> 01:12:21.152]  You think I want to go march up against the police when they're saying no protest and get arrested?
[01:12:21.172 --> 01:12:25.074]  I've been arrested three times doing it though because the First Amendment is important.
[01:12:26.615 --> 01:12:27.275]  Here's a bad example.
[01:12:28.335 --> 01:12:30.256]  This is out of Arlington Voice.
[01:12:31.557 --> 01:12:34.118]  But the good news is, it's the police exposing it.
[01:12:37.318 --> 01:12:40.279]  Police Union exposes department's long-denied quota system.
[01:12:40.299 --> 01:12:43.819]  I love how all these departments deny quotas, and then they've got quotas.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.920]  Unwritten or written, you get promoted when you write more tickets.
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:13:03.104]  And I don't care if you write tickets of real drunk drivers or arrest them or somebody really speeding or whatever, but when you've just got some old lady pulled over and her sticker's out and you write her three tickets or you harass, you know, the 18-wheelers because they had dust on their bumper or whatever, I mean, the truck police are the ones that are really just destroying a lot of lives.
[01:13:04.989 --> 01:13:08.165]  And basically are the equivalent of pirates out there just revenue generating.
[01:13:09.332 --> 01:13:17.156]  An Arlington Police Union is exposing the department's informal quota system after 15 patrol officers were placed on administrative leave for inflating traffic stop data.
[01:13:17.816 --> 01:13:21.178]  Internal emails and documents... I mean, you think cops really just want to pull you over and give you tickets?
[01:13:21.198 --> 01:13:21.738]  Folks, they don't.
[01:13:22.339 --> 01:13:34.104]  Internal emails and documents released by the Arlington Municipal Patrolmen's Association is shedding light on the department's use of informal quota-based performance systems to withhold privileges from underperforming officers.
[01:13:34.164 --> 01:13:35.665]  So, good for the officers.
[01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:36.606]  And that's what you need.
[01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:39.306]  See, I said it's a bad story about police.
[01:13:39.827 --> 01:13:41.347]  It's bad about the leadership.
[01:13:41.807 --> 01:13:44.127]  It's good for the grassroots police.
[01:13:44.788 --> 01:13:47.048]  They've got plenty of real crimes to investigate.
[01:13:48.288 --> 01:13:54.570]  The justice system needs to be going in there with huge fines against criminals that commit crimes against property and things.
[01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:59.030]  Don't give a lady a $100 ticket for her stickers out a month.
[01:14:00.631 --> 01:14:06.212]  Somebody that robs a car, go bust a chop shop, put them all in jail, seize all of it, take their houses.
[01:14:07.168 --> 01:14:08.510]  When you've convicted them!
[01:14:11.115 --> 01:14:11.736]  But they don't do that.
[01:14:11.776 --> 01:14:19.008]  They just plea bargain, and then the guys at the cop, the chop shop, if they even get in trouble, get probation.
[01:14:20.205 --> 01:14:22.067]  So, the revenue generating has to stop.
[01:14:22.127 --> 01:14:25.850]  So that's a good story because it shows how these paradigms are complex.
[01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:34.277]  It's bad the police are doing this, but nine times out of ten, whether it's Houston or whether it's New York, I see these stories, it's the police exposing that the crime lab's corrupt.
[01:14:34.658 --> 01:14:37.260]  It's the police exposing that they're ordered to go out.
[01:14:38.101 --> 01:14:45.007]  Remember a few years ago, the police union in New York said, look, we're ordered to give old ladies tickets for sitting more than five minutes on a park bench.
[01:14:46.069 --> 01:14:49.151]  We're ordered to just totally harass people.
[01:14:49.471 --> 01:14:50.572]  Everybody hates us now.
[01:14:50.892 --> 01:14:51.732]  We don't want to do this.
[01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:53.994]  And so they had to start backing off of that.
[01:14:54.594 --> 01:14:58.376]  And that's an example of how the police can put unique pressure on government itself.
[01:14:59.297 --> 01:15:07.441]  But the globalists with this whole divide-and-conquer strategy and this strong city-UN initiative don't want the citizens to ever interface with the police or real community.
[01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.343]  They want it to be the UN and the local.
[01:15:10.283 --> 01:15:29.708]  Socialist organizations in the Black Lives Matter, George Soros, Ford Foundation groups coming in, bullying the departments, terrorizing them, exacerbating crises, scapegoating all governmental problems on the police and sheriff's departments, so they then become totally political and go under leftist control.
[01:15:30.048 --> 01:15:33.949]  And then boy, once that happens, you get a Chicago, a New York, a D.C., a total hellhole.
[01:15:34.921 --> 01:15:35.381]  Every time.
[01:15:35.421 --> 01:15:39.863]  These people will wreck your society, socialists, when they get control of a police department.
[01:15:39.883 --> 01:15:41.583]  It is a living hell.
[01:15:42.823 --> 01:15:44.044]  And police departments know this.
[01:15:46.164 --> 01:15:50.986]  And then you get political police that sit there and laugh while the social justice warriors beat you up.
[01:15:53.257 --> 01:16:02.020]  Now I've got some concern about Donald Trump, and I rarely do, but a lot of times it's because he's super smart, but sometimes he doesn't fully understand some technical subjects.
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:05.221]  Or he's causing a debate for political purposes.
[01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:06.301]  He's sly like a fox.
[01:16:06.321 --> 01:16:14.143]  But he put out a tweet, and I'll cover it in the next segment, where he said he'll be meeting with the NRA to see what Homeland Security are calling for.
[01:16:14.163 --> 01:16:14.604]  Here's the tweet.
[01:16:14.864 --> 01:16:22.046]  I'll be meeting with the NRA, who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on terrorist watch lists or the no-fly list to buy guns.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:34.609]  Now, is that a neutral statement, or does it kind of sound like he's going to be meeting with them about not allowing people on the terror watch list or the no-fly list to buy guns?
[01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:38.553]  It sounds like he's saying he's going to be meeting with them about asking for that.
[01:16:38.793 --> 01:16:39.373]  It's not clear.
[01:16:39.613 --> 01:16:41.975]  It's ambiguous, but it leans 60-40 towards that.
[01:16:46.744 --> 01:16:49.986]  So, Donald Trump needs to get educated on this, or he needs to clarify what he's saying.
[01:16:50.527 --> 01:16:53.489]  I don't know which it is, because this ends due process.
[01:16:53.569 --> 01:17:06.399]  And the NRA came back and said, we support due process systems if someone's on a no-fly list, having that flagged in the NICS system, but not denying it of you if there's not any credible threat or indictment or investigation.
[01:17:06.659 --> 01:17:08.340]  We need due process, is what the NRA said.
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.061]  They're absolutely right.
[01:17:09.201 --> 01:17:13.304]  This will end due process and allow putting gun owners on these no-gun-by lists.
[01:17:15.876 --> 01:17:18.578]  Very, very serious situation.
[01:17:18.638 --> 01:17:20.819]  It's a holy grail they've been pushing for for eight years.
[01:17:21.339 --> 01:17:22.800]  And so I hope Trump clarifies that.
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:23.741]  He shoots out a lot of tweets.
[01:17:24.341 --> 01:17:25.242]  We'll certainly find out.
[01:17:25.262 --> 01:17:30.905]  I'm going to shoot a special message later today after the show just to Donald Trump on this subject of the no-fly list.
[01:17:31.065 --> 01:17:34.748]  And I know it gets to him to try to give him a briefing on the subject.
[01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:39.150]  Or perhaps I'm wrong and I'm misinterpreting this and he needs to clarify.
[01:17:39.491 --> 01:17:44.314]  We're going to go to break, but first I want to just play now this Sha'Carri Jackson clip or part of it.
[01:17:44.334 --> 01:17:45.894]  We'll play more when he joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:17:45.914 --> 01:17:53.139]  16-year-old, super informed, black Trump supporter, school's leftist Black Lives Matter person.
[01:17:53.359 --> 01:17:57.141]  This is up on InfoWars.com, but here's two minutes of the clip as we go to break.
[01:17:57.201 --> 01:17:59.243]  It's powerful stuff in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:17:59.303 --> 01:17:59.603]  Here it is.
[01:18:00.163 --> 01:18:02.105]  We're gonna drop Hillary!
[01:18:02.325 --> 01:18:04.046]  T-R-U-N-B!
[01:18:04.126 --> 01:18:05.728]  We're gonna drop Hillary!
[01:18:06.668 --> 01:18:07.509]  T-R-U-N-B!
[01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:09.591]  We're gonna drop Hillary!
[01:18:09.631 --> 01:18:12.653]  You black and Sephora are racist.
[01:18:12.673 --> 01:18:13.254]  That's sad.
[01:18:13.334 --> 01:18:14.355]  That's real sad.
[01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:15.616]  He's against you.
[01:18:17.406 --> 01:18:20.387]  Why would you support a racist?
[01:18:20.587 --> 01:18:24.048]  He's gonna send you back to Africa, that's what he said.
[01:18:24.249 --> 01:18:28.470]  He said send Mexicans back to Mexico.
[01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:33.912]  You are a disgrace to America for being a young black man supporting a racist.
[01:18:34.052 --> 01:18:34.452]  Thank you.
[01:18:34.532 --> 01:18:36.073]  Yeah, that is awesome.
[01:18:36.853 --> 01:18:37.554]  That's sad!
[01:18:37.754 --> 01:18:38.415]  That's awesome.
[01:18:38.475 --> 01:18:41.397]  How does your parents feel about you holding a Trump stamp?
[01:18:41.437 --> 01:18:42.478]  Well, they think he's great.
[01:18:42.698 --> 01:18:47.443]  Well, they think he's great for America, too, because he doesn't like you or your parents.
[01:18:47.603 --> 01:18:49.525]  You didn't answer my question, by the way.
[01:18:49.565 --> 01:18:51.086]  Yeah, you didn't answer my question.
[01:18:51.106 --> 01:18:51.907]  What has he said?
[01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:54.269]  He said send Mexicans back to Mexico.
[01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:56.331]  No, he said- He said don't let Muslims here.
[01:18:56.351 --> 01:18:57.111]  Yeah, he said- What?
[01:18:57.131 --> 01:18:59.854]  He said, are you going to let me talk or are you going to yell?
[01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:04.957]  No, I'm telling you because you holding this stuff back, and you need to be taught- We can't have an educated conversation, can we?
[01:19:04.977 --> 01:19:05.797]  We cannot do that, right?
[01:19:06.157 --> 01:19:07.358]  Okay, okay.
[01:19:07.978 --> 01:19:11.721]  She just graduated high school, so she's not a kid no more.
[01:19:12.201 --> 01:19:13.181]  Okay.
[01:19:13.361 --> 01:19:16.643]  What would you tell him when a racist- Not his fault.
[01:19:18.131 --> 01:19:28.478]  We're going to come back with more of this, but this guy is wearing a gay rainbow when Trump is trying to support folks that are gay and not being killed by jihadis that Hillary's supporting.
[01:19:29.379 --> 01:19:39.586]  And then Mexico has one of the strongest border controls in the world with Guatemala, Central America, and they torture people and they put them six months to a year hard labor.
[01:19:39.987 --> 01:19:42.909]  And Mexico has said they can't take any more migrants even to the U.S.
[01:19:43.129 --> 01:19:44.130]  because it's bankrupting them.
[01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:45.912]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:19:46.553 --> 01:19:47.034]  The U.S.
[01:19:47.074 --> 01:19:53.885]  is one of the most open countries in the world, and now it's offering all this free stuff to illegals to create this divide and conquer.
[01:19:53.905 --> 01:19:55.327]  And this guy is so stupid.
[01:19:55.627 --> 01:19:56.549]  We'll be back with more of it.
[01:19:56.569 --> 01:19:56.970]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.305 --> 01:20:13.010]  This message is not just addressed to my fellow Americans, but addressed to people across the world of every race, color, and creed who believe in free speech, enshrined here in our republic as the First Amendment.
[01:20:13.690 --> 01:20:17.071]  It's the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights because it is the most important.
[01:20:17.091 --> 01:20:21.853]  The right to speak, the right to publish, the right to assemble, the right to petition, the right to...
[01:20:22.113 --> 01:20:26.074]  Practice your own religion and not having a state-run or authorized system.
[01:20:26.214 --> 01:20:35.496]  We have seen Facebook, Google, Twitter and other media platforms increasingly censor even mainline libertarian and conservative ideas.
[01:20:35.796 --> 01:20:47.319]  Ladies and gentlemen, Facebook, if it's able to successfully get away with censoring a wide spectrum of ideas that the establishment doesn't agree with, not just conservatives, will set a mega-massive precedent.
[01:20:47.859 --> 01:20:49.319]  Facebook's over a third of the internet.
[01:20:49.559 --> 01:20:50.020]  Think about that.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.000]  Of the traffic and people visiting things.
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.000]  And then it's over.
[01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:57.601]  You think it's bad that communist China with a billion, 300 million people is censoring?
[01:20:58.442 --> 01:21:05.683]  Zuckerberg, who calls his users dumb effers, has been meeting with the Chinese censorship leadership, openly trying to tweak it.
[01:21:05.803 --> 01:21:08.224]  He met with Merkel, and openly in a hot mic.
[01:21:08.604 --> 01:21:10.727]  Don't worry, I'm going to start suppressing and censoring people.
[01:21:23.905 --> 01:21:25.106]  Well, that's your free speech.
[01:21:25.426 --> 01:21:27.847]  It's not hate propaganda, as they call it.
[01:21:28.167 --> 01:21:34.770]  If they set the precedent on these issues, they will basically ban any other type of speech that the globalists don't want.
[01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:36.971]  This is the ultimate threat to humanity.
[01:21:37.371 --> 01:21:39.552]  This is worse than what we saw in the Soviet Union.
[01:21:39.952 --> 01:21:43.753]  This is right out of Nazi Germany or right out of Maoist China.
[01:21:44.134 --> 01:21:45.474]  So we're fighting for free speech.
[01:21:45.814 --> 01:21:49.156]  When you spread the word about InfoWars.com, our videos, our stories, our reports,
[01:21:49.636 --> 01:21:55.878]  And when you post it on different platforms, that circumvents their AI systems that are trying to restrict the flow of information.
[01:21:56.018 --> 01:21:57.939]  We stand together or we hang separate.
[01:21:58.159 --> 01:22:03.021]  Another thing we're doing is not just battling to stop the censorship, we're also building other platforms.
[01:22:03.441 --> 01:22:11.244]  Getting on as many third-party systems as there are out there and spreading the word of basic free market liberty and human empowerment and the new renaissance.
[01:22:11.764 --> 01:22:14.985]  But also, the experts I've talked to said, Alex, you missed the boat.
[01:22:15.265 --> 01:22:15.805]  We're good to go.
[01:22:40.777 --> 01:22:52.020]  That everybody go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter to get exclusive articles, videos, promo codes, sometimes the shopping cart like we had a few weeks ago with Hillary for prison, 50% off.
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:57.161]  I mean, there are some big discounts we send to incentivize people and plus you're some of the most hardcore patriots.
[01:22:57.461 --> 01:23:01.802]  You can send the email and the newsletter on with exclusive videos and articles many days.
[01:23:02.382 --> 01:23:03.402]  So that's another great reason.
[01:23:03.442 --> 01:23:07.043]  But overall, it's so that we have direct contact
[01:23:07.603 --> 01:23:21.548]  With fellow patriots out there around the world, and if they try to start shutting our websites down and other things, which they've tried to do, and kick us off Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, you name it, we'll be able to send you direct videos that you can then send on to others.
[01:23:21.568 --> 01:23:30.132]  We've all got to start thinking about the censorship and actively fighting it, getting more active and not taking independent liberty-based media for granted, which I know you don't do.
[01:23:31.352 --> 01:23:41.499]  But really having a sense of urgency and getting the info out more while building new avenues on cutting-edge tech and cutting-edge platforms, but also old tech like email.
[01:23:41.759 --> 01:23:49.164]  So please join hundreds of thousands of others that have been signing up every few months at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:23:49.505 --> 01:23:58.611]  And you can also spread the word about our free feeds and more podcasts, Android apps, iPhone apps, it's all free at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:24:04.321 --> 01:24:08.564]  This just broke in the last few minutes.
[01:24:09.344 --> 01:24:13.346]  We're going to work to get Paul Watson from London, just back from Germany, covering Bilderberg.
[01:24:14.687 --> 01:24:15.808]  And the Brexit.
[01:24:16.688 --> 01:24:18.129]  The globalists set up the EU.
[01:24:18.169 --> 01:24:19.410]  It's unaccountable, unelected.
[01:24:21.926 --> 01:24:25.948]  The EU didn't let any of the countries but two out of twenty-something vote to enter it.
[01:24:25.988 --> 01:24:27.228]  They won't let you vote to get out of it.
[01:24:27.248 --> 01:24:30.170]  They're even trying to say, we may just ignore you if you try it.
[01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:33.411]  They're threatening economic blockades, you name it.
[01:24:34.012 --> 01:24:44.237]  But they've got a lot of liberals and others now, not just conservatives and nationalists, wanting to leave because almost all their laws are made by an unelected body of three EU boards.
[01:24:44.617 --> 01:24:45.918]  The Parliament is ceremonial.
[01:24:46.338 --> 01:24:49.740]  And once that's known, it doesn't matter if you're liberal or you're conservative,
[01:24:50.902 --> 01:24:51.763]  You speak out against it.
[01:24:51.783 --> 01:24:52.724]  Well, here's the bad news.
[01:24:53.424 --> 01:25:02.772]  British Labour Party, that's Liberal, like Democrat, British politician Jo Cox has died after she was attacked near Leeds.
[01:25:03.092 --> 01:25:04.874]  Police say a suspect is in custody.
[01:25:05.114 --> 01:25:06.735]  He shot her and stabbed her.
[01:25:07.155 --> 01:25:17.004]  She's a leading figure, leading the Liberals to what they believe is going to be a 5 to 10 point victory for the British to leave the Euro, the Brexit.
[01:25:18.465 --> 01:25:19.746]  And she was terminated.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:29.044]  Watch, it'll be some mentally ill person on SSRIs who was under government psychiatry, psychiatric control, like Sirhan Sirhan.
[01:25:29.084 --> 01:25:29.604]  We'll see.
[01:25:30.585 --> 01:25:33.406]  She was at a public event and she was shot and stabbed.
[01:25:33.746 --> 01:25:49.494]  Oh, there's like a total gun ban in the UK, but magically, the anti-EU Labour Member of Parliament executed with a gun
[01:25:50.655 --> 01:25:52.215]  In gun-free, jolly old England.
[01:25:53.496 --> 01:25:54.756]  I mean, what is the headline on that?
[01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:57.957]  British lawmaker killed in shock attack ahead of EU vote.
[01:25:58.557 --> 01:26:00.057]  Oh, shock attack!
[01:26:03.178 --> 01:26:04.158]  Globalists mean business.
[01:26:04.178 --> 01:26:15.281]  You know, today, I came on the start of the broadcast with this five-shot, .410, with triple-aught buck handgun.
[01:26:16.481 --> 01:26:17.141]  And I walked in,
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.224]  To my concealed carry crew and said.
[01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:28.251]  It's always important for everybody to be armed, isn't it?
[01:26:30.554 --> 01:26:32.076]  But oh, she was safe in England.
[01:26:32.157 --> 01:26:33.719]  They have basically a gun ban.
[01:26:35.196 --> 01:26:50.729]  What is it, less than 1% of the population has shooting clubs where shotguns and hunting rifles are held and you go and the hunt master lets you get your gun out and then you all go out and you hunt and they'll now usually have to have a sheriff or someone along with you.
[01:26:52.270 --> 01:26:54.051]  All because of a couple mass shootings they had there.
[01:26:55.192 --> 01:26:56.894]  It's not that bad in Australia, but close.
[01:26:59.696 --> 01:27:00.557]  And now she's dead.
[01:27:01.598 --> 01:27:02.859]  So, anti-EU
[01:27:07.352 --> 01:27:10.036]  Member of Parliament executed ahead of EU vote.
[01:27:10.076 --> 01:27:10.657]  That's your headline.
[01:27:10.677 --> 01:27:12.600]  In fact, put that earlier headline up.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:13.120]  They got it.
[01:27:14.542 --> 01:27:23.696]  Anti-EU Member of Parliament executed ahead of Brexit vote.
[01:27:25.523 --> 01:27:27.404]  That is simply amazing.
[01:27:27.424 --> 01:27:30.467]  In fact, the headline I'm going to go with on this is exactly that other headline.
[01:27:30.487 --> 01:27:32.408]  Will you guys put that back on screen, a few of those headlines you just had?
[01:27:32.428 --> 01:27:36.211]  Again, for TV viewers, for radio listeners, go to infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:38.753]  Yeah, I'd say Yahoo News got the headline right.
[01:27:38.833 --> 01:27:41.735]  British lawmaker killed in shock attack ahead of EU vote.
[01:27:43.236 --> 01:27:44.077]  I would just say this.
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:54.765]  Leading voice calling for exit from EU executed ahead of vote.
[01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:56.990]  Oh, there's nothing suspicious here.
[01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:59.052]  Kind of like what happened with Scalia.
[01:27:59.232 --> 01:28:00.213]  Everything's fine.
[01:28:00.353 --> 01:28:01.354]  Everything's wonderful.
[01:28:01.754 --> 01:28:02.875]  Everything's okay.
[01:28:03.136 --> 01:28:04.157]  Everybody go back to sleep.
[01:28:04.797 --> 01:28:05.598]  This is so sad.
[01:28:05.618 --> 01:28:08.440]  And they've been executing nationalists all over the EU.
[01:28:08.681 --> 01:28:10.442]  Usually Muslims come up and shoot them or kill them.
[01:28:11.683 --> 01:28:14.946]  Even though when they're not anti-Muslim, it's just that's usually the executor.
[01:28:15.567 --> 01:28:16.347]  The executioner.
[01:28:17.128 --> 01:28:26.877]  A little lined-up toy, because their imam will be controlled by the globalists, and then the message goes down to Habib, you know, that he needs to tell his flock that this person needs to die, and then they die.
[01:28:26.897 --> 01:28:28.778]  Oh, they die.
[01:28:29.139 --> 01:28:31.581]  Because, see, Islam is natural mind control.
[01:28:31.721 --> 01:28:33.122]  And I'm not saying this guy's gonna be a Muslim.
[01:28:33.302 --> 01:28:34.423]  I'm just saying in a lot of cases it is.
[01:28:35.144 --> 01:28:40.809]  Because it's so cultural, it's so controlling, it's all about dying, it's all about, you know, doing whatever you have to, it's all about
[01:28:44.005 --> 01:28:45.606]  Never getting along with anybody, basically.
[01:28:46.046 --> 01:28:54.290]  I mean, I got articles here today in Afghanistan where they have sex slaves, little girls, that are Muslims, that they just grab and force to go out and lure in other Muslims to kill them.
[01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:55.671]  They're all just killing each other!
[01:28:58.319 --> 01:28:59.039]  This is crazy!
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.721]  Paul Joseph Watson will be on at 45 after.
[01:29:02.081 --> 01:29:05.423]  Jacari Jackson's coming in right after this break, talking about social justice warriors.
[01:29:05.803 --> 01:29:06.624]  But there's the headline.
[01:29:07.624 --> 01:29:12.647]  Taliban uses honey trap boys, yeah little boys too, not as little girls, to kill Afghan police.
[01:29:13.067 --> 01:29:23.073]  Because pedophilia and homosexuality is so ubiquitous in Muslim countries, especially Afghanistan, they send out little boys to lure them to their deaths.
[01:29:25.549 --> 01:29:30.092]  But, just like this Afghan immigrant, his parents are from there.
[01:29:30.853 --> 01:29:32.554]  CIA brought him in, admittedly.
[01:29:34.196 --> 01:29:37.918]  He goes, hangs out, he's on the gay apps, but then he separately goes and kills them.
[01:29:38.579 --> 01:29:40.060]  Because, see, it's okay when he does it.
[01:29:41.361 --> 01:29:42.482]  As long as he kills them later.
[01:29:43.262 --> 01:29:47.786]  This is just a mental patient cult of total screwballs.
[01:29:49.025 --> 01:29:52.031]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.952 --> 01:29:55.637]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.034 --> 01:30:12.603]  The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, as summarized by the Senate Armed Services Committee, proposes a 25% reduction in generals and admirals across the board, reports the Daily Caller.
[01:30:12.843 --> 01:30:21.569]  A summary of the bill provided by the committee states the drawdown in general officers also applies at the 3, 2, and 1 star levels.
[01:30:21.809 --> 01:30:32.900]  The committee reasons that over the past 30 years, the end strength of the joint force has decreased 38%, but the ratio of four-star officers to the overall force has increased by 65%.
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:43.049]  The bill's summary explains that by making heavy cuts at the three and four-star level, it can allow the services a broader base to develop future leaders.
[01:30:43.269 --> 01:30:46.913]  The summary also cites budget concerns as a reason for the reduction.
[01:30:47.133 --> 01:30:54.315]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[01:31:10.399 --> 01:31:17.322]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:31:17.502 --> 01:31:22.203]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:31:22.383 --> 01:31:26.025]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[01:31:27.225 --> 01:31:28.046]  We're good to go.
[01:31:43.345 --> 01:31:47.709]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:31:47.829 --> 01:31:51.091]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:31:51.232 --> 01:31:57.377]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:31:57.537 --> 01:31:59.759]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:59.919 --> 01:32:11.108]  Everyone, Obama and Trump, as well as the NRA and LGBT lobbyists, are saying the Orlando shooting requires new gun control measures because it's now an issue of national security.
[01:32:11.348 --> 01:32:14.430]  Democrats in Congress just ended a 15-hour filibuster.
[01:32:14.611 --> 01:32:20.635]  Republicans have caved and said they will hold a vote on whether to block people who have just been labeled a terrorist.
[01:32:20.815 --> 01:32:23.798]  Remember, this is secretly and without trial.
[01:32:24.058 --> 01:32:30.483]  People are put on terror watch lists and no-fly watch lists without their knowledge, without being told of the charges against them.
[01:32:30.663 --> 01:32:35.066]  Without being able to confront their accusers in an open trial by jury.
[01:32:35.246 --> 01:32:38.629]  Now we're going to apply punishments and sanctions against them.
[01:32:38.849 --> 01:32:42.792]  This is a star chamber process that the Bill of Rights was written to stop.
[01:32:43.012 --> 01:32:45.614]  Terror attacks are not a gun control issue.
[01:32:45.674 --> 01:32:47.395]  They're a border control issue.
[01:32:47.555 --> 01:32:52.679]  Without background checks for migrants, terrorists are free to use nuclear, biological or chemical weapons.
[01:32:52.979 --> 01:32:56.742]  A rifle may be your only defense against that kind of weapon.
[01:32:56.942 --> 01:32:58.864]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:33:06.454 --> 01:33:17.001]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[01:33:17.341 --> 01:33:22.725]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[01:33:23.265 --> 01:33:28.489]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:30.770]  It is a big idea.
[01:33:31.871 --> 01:33:32.852]  A new world order.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.402]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[01:33:39.522 --> 01:33:41.044]  It's just pancakes.
[01:33:43.425 --> 01:33:47.248]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[01:34:00.472 --> 01:34:06.041]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[01:34:10.407 --> 01:34:10.947]  Guns will be taken.
[01:34:10.967 --> 01:34:11.928]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:34:12.108 --> 01:34:14.209]  We're going to take all of them.
[01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:19.031]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[01:34:19.091 --> 01:34:20.532]  Global governance at last.
[01:34:20.612 --> 01:34:21.592]  Is it one world?
[01:34:21.612 --> 01:34:23.273]  The central bank is in charge.
[01:34:23.313 --> 01:34:26.775]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:34:26.875 --> 01:34:30.917]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[01:34:31.537 --> 01:34:32.117]  We're live.
[01:34:33.178 --> 01:34:37.880]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:40.677 --> 01:34:42.898]  We have Paul Watson joining us in about 10 minutes.
[01:34:42.938 --> 01:34:45.279]  Sha'Carri Jackson's going to be riding shotgun with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:34:45.299 --> 01:34:50.381]  We're talking about social justice warriors and some of the amazing footage he got out in Atlanta and other areas the last few days.
[01:34:50.401 --> 01:34:51.222]  It's now going viral.
[01:34:51.962 --> 01:34:58.125]  But the first reports came out five minutes ago about this Labor MP, Jo Cox, dies from being shot and stabbed.
[01:34:58.485 --> 01:35:00.306]  And some of the first reports were that she was
[01:35:01.326 --> 01:35:11.911]  Pro-Brexit, because most of the Labour Party is pro-exiting the Euro, because even Liberals realize that you shouldn't have an unelected group controlling your nation.
[01:35:12.632 --> 01:35:19.755]  But reportedly, we have her tweets, she actually said, immigration is not a legitimate concern, but it's not a good reason to leave the EU.
[01:35:19.795 --> 01:35:23.197]  Again, immigration is a legitimate concern, but it's not a good reason to leave the EU.
[01:35:23.217 --> 01:35:30.401]  So she was reportedly on the fence, or pro-Europe, and that now they're saying, and these are tentative reports just now coming out,
[01:35:31.081 --> 01:35:40.825]  That whoever shot and stabbed her in the gun-free zone of the UK screamed, you know, don't stay in the Brexit when he attacked her.
[01:35:40.885 --> 01:35:47.807]  So is this a false flag to try to turn the polls against the UK leaving the unelected EU?
[01:35:48.688 --> 01:35:54.070]  Or is it someone really mad about the fact that a foreign power has occupied their nation?
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:36:02.851]  I'm not pushing for violence, and I think this will backfire if it was someone who was misguided, and we're sad for her family, but, you know, the French were occupied by the Germans.
[01:36:03.652 --> 01:36:07.578]  This is a political occupation, but still, nevertheless, that's what's happening.
[01:36:08.219 --> 01:36:10.022]  And so it's very, very similar to the Vichy French.
[01:36:12.492 --> 01:36:17.497]  If they do take all the delegates from Bernie Sanders and give it to Hillary, do people have a right to get upset and angry?
[01:36:17.637 --> 01:36:24.904]  I'm not saying they should do that at this point, but at what point when they start picking the candidates for us, what do we do?
[01:36:25.445 --> 01:36:31.350]  I want to put bookends on this until Watson joins us, but we'll also ask Jakari Jackson's view on that.
[01:36:31.731 --> 01:36:33.633]  Now, before I go any further,
[01:36:34.733 --> 01:36:35.414]  Uh, here today.
[01:36:35.835 --> 01:36:39.379]  We're running a special because Tim Kennedy, one of the top soldiers in the U.S.
[01:36:39.399 --> 01:36:42.823]  military, is now an analyst and a reporter for Infowars.com.
[01:36:43.684 --> 01:36:52.035]  And so we're very excited about the fact that he's been doing a lot of special reports and productions for us all over the world in between hunting Hitler and all the other things he's doing.
[01:36:52.876 --> 01:36:56.380]  He's got a movie that he helped produce that's premiering on 800 movie screens.
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.202]  Range 15 tonight as well.
[01:36:58.222 --> 01:37:00.904]  A lot of actors I really like, like William Shatner and others.
[01:37:01.565 --> 01:37:02.546]  But that's a side issue.
[01:37:03.147 --> 01:37:07.831]  Tim Kennedy's Game Changer, 15% off the three products he loves.
[01:37:08.432 --> 01:37:11.335]  That's Super Male Vitality, also Super Female Vitality goes for that.
[01:37:12.016 --> 01:37:15.199]  Brain Force, and of course the Secret 12, Vitamin B12.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:17.861]  Organic sublingual drops.
[01:37:18.441 --> 01:37:28.047]  All of those together 15% off or by themselves 15% off at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:37:28.267 --> 01:37:30.229]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:37:31.389 --> 01:37:34.391]  And the money we make from this obviously makes everything we're doing here possible.
[01:37:34.771 --> 01:37:39.995]  We want to get a few more reporters, a few more editors, video people, and crews so we can really always have crews.
[01:37:40.595 --> 01:37:55.612]  Out there like in Dallas today for the Trump rally coming up at seven o'clock tonight for the news and like the EU and covering the Brexit at Bilderberg with three reporters or just pretty much all the time we've got reporters on the ground with this crew we built.
[01:37:55.692 --> 01:37:57.334]  Jakari just got back from Atlanta.
[01:37:57.774 --> 01:38:02.015]  So thank you all for your support at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:38:02.275 --> 01:38:04.016]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:38:04.796 --> 01:38:07.737]  All Alexa Pure Water filters are 20% off right now as specials running.
[01:38:08.097 --> 01:38:10.418]  InfoWarsStore.com and so much more.
[01:38:10.438 --> 01:38:20.461]  But from solar base station power supply units, the very best out there at the lowest prices, to you name it, they're all available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:38:21.001 --> 01:38:22.622]  Okay, shifting gears.
[01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:27.922]  Here in a moment, back to what Jakari Jackson has been covering.
[01:38:27.962 --> 01:38:30.062]  He just got back from Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:38:30.843 --> 01:38:48.229]  Really got a whole bunch of amazing videos that are going viral right now that really just tell us more of the same story over and over again that the Black Lives Matter groups, the Bernie Sanders groups, the liberal groups, the socialist groups,
[01:38:49.874 --> 01:38:52.395]  It's just like the Mark Dice videos, or the videos we shoot in Austin.
[01:38:52.435 --> 01:39:01.298]  I'm sorry, you go to a supposed liberal area, a university area, they a lot of times don't even know what planet they're on.
[01:39:01.778 --> 01:39:12.081]  And they really are angry and feel wronged, and will run up, particularly to quote minorities, a lot of times white people do this to Hispanics or black folks, and say, what are you doing here?
[01:39:12.121 --> 01:39:15.282]  He's racist, he's bad, he's evil, even if you don't like Donald Trump.
[01:39:15.982 --> 01:39:19.864]  They've been misrepresenting what he really says and what he does.
[01:39:20.545 --> 01:39:24.327]  And Jakari got footage of arrests that were made, just all sorts of stuff there in Atlanta.
[01:39:24.347 --> 01:39:27.329]  We're going to have, again, two of our reporters up there tonight in Dallas.
[01:39:27.349 --> 01:39:30.111]  We'll have live feeds on the Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central.
[01:39:30.391 --> 01:39:33.052]  Find details at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:39:33.092 --> 01:39:39.796]  But Jakari, before we play a few minutes of this 10-minute viral video, obviously there's a lot when you're out there with a camera that people don't see.
[01:39:39.856 --> 01:39:41.898]  What is your sense of covering these events?
[01:39:42.498 --> 01:39:45.240]  Well, with this one in particular, it was a much calmer event.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:53.467]  I know we showed some of the footage of the arrest right there, but this pales in comparison to someplace like Albuquerque, where people were lighting fires and throwing barricades.
[01:39:53.487 --> 01:39:54.468]  You got hit in the head with a rock.
[01:39:54.548 --> 01:39:55.829]  Yeah, I got hit in the head with a rock.
[01:39:56.189 --> 01:39:57.931]  So this was a much calmer crowd.
[01:39:57.971 --> 01:39:59.572]  It was a much smaller crowd as well.
[01:40:00.413 --> 01:40:08.159]  If you take away all the journalists, I'd say there were maybe three or four hundred people there at any given time, as opposed to someplace like Albuquerque or Anaheim, where you had thousands.
[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:10.821]  So it was a much calmer situation, but
[01:40:11.542 --> 01:40:14.383]  Tempers did flare, and that's some of the footage that we have coming up.
[01:40:14.904 --> 01:40:20.146]  This one thing in particular, it was a conversation between an older gentleman and a younger guy.
[01:40:20.186 --> 01:40:21.947]  I think the younger guy was about 16 or so.
[01:40:22.407 --> 01:40:24.148]  And he was a Trump supporter, young black man.
[01:40:24.648 --> 01:40:26.970]  And the older guy comes up to him, he says, you're a disgrace.
[01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:28.770]  And I run into this a lot.
[01:40:28.810 --> 01:40:32.732]  When we went out to Albuquerque, there's a similar thing where Latinos were yelling at each other.
[01:40:32.752 --> 01:40:35.314]  You're not a real Latino if you support Donald Trump.
[01:40:35.494 --> 01:40:40.056]  And they're saying a similar thing to this young black man, saying that you're not a real black person if you support Donald Trump.
[01:40:40.276 --> 01:40:42.437]  Now it wasn't don't support any of these candidates.
[01:40:42.497 --> 01:40:45.898]  It was like, you don't support Donald Trump, but you have to support Hillary.
[01:40:46.178 --> 01:40:47.779]  And I'm like, why would I want to support Hillary?
[01:40:48.379 --> 01:40:51.620]  Miss saying she wants to go out and put hot sauce on all of her food.
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:53.441]  You know, very racist statements like that.
[01:40:53.741 --> 01:40:54.701]  Completely ridiculous.
[01:40:54.761 --> 01:40:59.963]  But he was very convinced that Hillary Clinton was the person for the nation, even to the point
[01:41:00.583 --> 01:41:05.788]  Where they criticize Trump, and as you were mentioning there, Alex, if you want to criticize the guy, there's legitimate ways to do it.
[01:41:05.848 --> 01:41:11.553]  But when you say that Trump wants to send black people back to Africa, I have never heard him say or even allude to that.
[01:41:11.593 --> 01:41:14.476]  Oh, by the way, I wanted to play this clip for over a month, two weeks.
[01:41:14.536 --> 01:41:15.277]  I keep forgetting to play it.
[01:41:15.317 --> 01:41:16.458]  It's the little Jewish kids.
[01:41:16.498 --> 01:41:22.383]  Can you guys pull up the Brainwashed Kids clip for later, where they just keep saying, I'm Jewish and he hates Jews.
[01:41:22.964 --> 01:41:26.407]  I mean, have you ever heard Trump say, send Africans to Africa?
[01:41:26.587 --> 01:41:28.648]  No, and that's what these people do.
[01:41:28.708 --> 01:41:47.478]  They'll take a grain of truth where he says he wants to send people who came here illegally, keyword illegally, back to their homelands or whatever, and you can have your feelings about that, but the issue is they so stretch this out of proportion, even when they talk about Hispanics coming into the country, they say he wants to send all Hispanics back to Mexico.
[01:41:47.498 --> 01:41:49.139]  Well, number one, they're not all from Mexico.
[01:41:49.499 --> 01:41:53.882]  Beyond that, he didn't say he wants to send them back if they came here illegally, if they've been here illegally.
[01:41:53.902 --> 01:41:56.043]  And he said make a faster path formally to come here.
[01:41:56.263 --> 01:41:56.423]  Yeah.
[01:41:56.723 --> 01:41:59.044]  You can't just say, we can pitch a light to 30, 40 million people.
[01:41:59.264 --> 01:42:00.285]  You're just legal now.
[01:42:01.185 --> 01:42:02.806]  And that's what these guys don't understand.
[01:42:02.826 --> 01:42:10.789]  And the guy in the video had clearly no understanding of immigration policy to the point where he's talking about Trump's wife needs to go back to wherever she's from.
[01:42:11.129 --> 01:42:12.930]  And people are saying she came here legally.
[01:42:12.970 --> 01:42:14.670]  There's a way to legally enter the United States of America.
[01:42:14.690 --> 01:42:15.911]  Well, that's another thing about Trump.
[01:42:16.371 --> 01:42:19.252]  His family is married to people from all over the world.
[01:42:19.432 --> 01:42:20.732]  Asian folks, you name it.
[01:42:20.992 --> 01:42:25.494]  He has one of the highest levels of putting, quote, minorities and women in executive positions.
[01:42:25.754 --> 01:42:28.094]  That's why he's got so many people that actually work for him coming out and defending him.
[01:42:28.254 --> 01:42:29.235]  And people have looked at the numbers.
[01:42:29.295 --> 01:42:29.715]  It's true.
[01:42:30.235 --> 01:42:33.836]  So the truth is, when it comes to this, they're totally making it up.
[01:42:34.556 --> 01:42:39.858]  And they're trying to basically just play on people's ignorance, hoping they don't know what Trump really said.
[01:42:39.878 --> 01:42:41.078]  But another thing is,
[01:42:41.858 --> 01:42:47.441]  This older gentleman that's yelling at the young Trump supporter, he's got a rainbow flag on.
[01:42:47.461 --> 01:42:48.662]  He's speaking with a lisp.
[01:42:48.722 --> 01:42:51.684]  I mean, he looks like, you know, he's a classic effeminate gay man.
[01:42:51.784 --> 01:42:52.204]  I don't know.
[01:42:52.284 --> 01:42:53.085]  I'm just speculating.
[01:42:53.505 --> 01:42:54.766]  But he's wearing a rainbow flag.
[01:42:54.806 --> 01:42:55.406]  Probably is.
[01:42:56.006 --> 01:42:59.128]  And you just saw 49 gay people murdered.
[01:42:59.508 --> 01:43:03.831]  Trump is out there saying, this is terrible, this is horrible, you shouldn't attack people for their sexual preferences.
[01:43:04.171 --> 01:43:06.872]  The Muslim leaders are not apologizing.
[01:43:07.173 --> 01:43:08.173]  He's not mad at them.
[01:43:08.233 --> 01:43:09.134]  He's mad at Trump.
[01:43:09.574 --> 01:43:11.114]  He just doesn't seem to get it.
[01:43:11.335 --> 01:43:11.815]  Absolutely.
[01:43:11.835 --> 01:43:13.555]  You hit the nail on the head right there, Alex.
[01:43:13.695 --> 01:43:19.437]  I ran into so many people out there who were saying, who were basically blaming Trump for what happened in Orlando.
[01:43:19.497 --> 01:43:24.778]  I'm like, how is that Trump's fault that a person took it upon himself to go into a gay bar and kill people?
[01:43:24.958 --> 01:43:26.259]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:43:26.279 --> 01:43:27.599]  I haven't seen those videos yet.
[01:43:27.699 --> 01:43:30.480]  You've got video where they blame Trump for Orlando?
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:32.081]  This is just people walking around talking.
[01:43:32.102 --> 01:43:36.326]  God, I wish you had that on block, because I've seen that in emails and seen comments, but I want to ask him.
[01:43:36.666 --> 01:43:38.388]  He's the guy that's trying to stop this.
[01:43:39.029 --> 01:43:40.110]  Wow, you actually heard that?
[01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:42.012]  Yeah, these are opinions of people.
[01:43:42.052 --> 01:43:43.754]  They want to blame him for everything.
[01:43:43.894 --> 01:43:45.215]  Everything is this man's fault.
[01:43:45.455 --> 01:43:47.678]  Oh, I've seen people on Albuquerque blaming the economy on him.
[01:43:48.058 --> 01:43:48.258]  Yeah.
[01:43:48.598 --> 01:43:50.560]  And I'm like, the guy's not even, he's not even a politician.
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:51.680]  He's never even been in office.
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:53.001]  I was like, how is that his fault?
[01:43:53.101 --> 01:44:03.268]  I mean, these guys, when we went out to Albuquerque, these 20-year-old or whatever Bernie supporters, they were blaming this guy, Donald Trump, for things that have been going on their entire lifetimes.
[01:44:03.308 --> 01:44:05.630]  And the man's just now becoming a politician.
[01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:07.671]  How is any of this stuff Donald Trump's fault?
[01:44:07.831 --> 01:44:09.112]  That's what's incredible.
[01:44:09.132 --> 01:44:11.774]  You're blaming him for stuff that he has nothing to do with.
[01:44:12.034 --> 01:44:16.817]  I've got a concern with him putting this tweet out to the NRA saying he wants to talk to them about banning people from having guns.
[01:44:17.978 --> 01:44:18.198]  Is that
[01:44:35.643 --> 01:44:36.604]  Randomly ban people?
[01:44:36.864 --> 01:44:42.988]  Absolutely, because you and I both know this, Alex, that we've seen multiple times young children being put on the no-fly list.
[01:44:43.048 --> 01:44:47.051]  It's not because they themselves are on the list, but they have a similar name to somebody who does.
[01:44:47.391 --> 01:45:00.500]  But if you have this not just no-fly, no-buy, but you extend that to all walks of life, now let's say the 15-year-old or the 5-year-old Boy Scout, when he becomes 18 and he wants to join the military, he's a military-age male on a no-fly list, you think they're going to let him in?
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:06.762]  Sure, it's an extrajudicial list, and even the NRA said, hey, we're looking at ways to do this where it follows due process.
[01:45:06.782 --> 01:45:08.342]  This is the end of due process if they're able to do it.
[01:45:08.582 --> 01:45:19.445]  Speaking of the brainwashing clip, here are Jewish children saying Donald Trump hates Jews when his daughter is married to, I mean, multiple members of the family are married to Jews.
[01:45:19.686 --> 01:45:21.726]  I mean, this is just the biggest load of bull.
[01:45:21.766 --> 01:45:22.086]  Here it is.
[01:45:22.966 --> 01:45:23.647]  Never Trump!
[01:45:23.747 --> 01:45:24.027]  Never Trump!
[01:45:24.507 --> 01:45:26.107]  Why don't you like Trump?
[01:45:26.668 --> 01:45:27.388]  Because he's racist?
[01:45:34.295 --> 01:45:37.142]  He's mean to Jews and I'm a Jew too.
[01:45:37.162 --> 01:45:38.605]  What has he done to the Jews?
[01:45:38.846 --> 01:45:39.768]  That's so mean.
[01:45:39.788 --> 01:45:41.873]  He said he's mean to Jews.
[01:45:44.054 --> 01:45:45.235]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:45:45.275 --> 01:45:46.795]  I can't play the whole thing.
[01:45:46.935 --> 01:45:48.396]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:45:48.596 --> 01:45:56.099]  Now, here's what I love about the anti-Semite groups that say the Jews are all one big brain and all agree with each other.
[01:45:56.119 --> 01:45:58.460]  These are hardcore liberal Jews.
[01:46:13.283 --> 01:46:29.669]  Who literally are the main people wanting to bring in radical Muslims, who whether, which side of this you're on, I'm not on either, do kill each other, and particularly Arabs killing Jews, and these little kids are going Donald Trump is mean to the Muslims, and he's mean to the Jews.
[01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:35.392]  It's all just total made-up garbage, but here are the Jews teaching their Jewish children
[01:46:36.485 --> 01:46:39.727]  That Donald Trump wants to hurt them, but the Muslims love them.
[01:46:40.328 --> 01:46:47.173]  I mean, the left, particularly leftist Jews, are the most brainwashed, crazy people I've ever seen in my life.
[01:46:47.213 --> 01:46:49.934]  They are the most self-loathing nuts.
[01:46:50.455 --> 01:46:52.036]  And then I see the white supremacists going,
[01:46:52.296 --> 01:46:55.819]  I fell on a banana peel, a Jew did it, and I go, there's a bunch of different groups of Jews.
[01:46:56.099 --> 01:46:57.941]  How do you sit there and say there's one group?
[01:46:57.961 --> 01:47:05.466]  There's like seven or eight major, you know, bodies of different Jewish political thought, and then there's so many other groups of individuals you can't even say.
[01:47:05.647 --> 01:47:06.868]  It's like, it's this labeling.
[01:47:07.068 --> 01:47:09.089]  You're black, Jakara, you gotta support Hillary.
[01:47:09.570 --> 01:47:11.351]  Or I'm white, I gotta support Trump.
[01:47:11.391 --> 01:47:12.572]  I mean, what does this even mean?
[01:47:12.912 --> 01:47:13.853]  It's just so dumbed down.
[01:47:13.873 --> 01:47:14.594]  What do you make of that clip?
[01:47:15.555 --> 01:47:19.519]  It's very shocking, but honestly, I've seen things like that when I go out to the streets.
[01:47:19.559 --> 01:47:22.944]  This is very, what I've heard referred to as the hive mindset.
[01:47:23.464 --> 01:47:29.432]  Because you're, you know, X, whether that's race, religion, whatever else, you can like this person or you can't like that person.
[01:47:29.472 --> 01:47:31.174]  And that's pretty much what we continue to see.
[01:47:31.194 --> 01:47:31.374]  Wow.
[01:47:31.414 --> 01:47:32.074]  We're going to break.
[01:47:32.094 --> 01:47:36.956]  I'm going to come back in two segments with Paul Watson and Angie Khari riding shotgun on this investigation.
[01:47:37.016 --> 01:47:40.297]  First the news was saying she might have been for the exiting of the EU.
[01:47:40.317 --> 01:47:42.618]  Then they're saying that she's not.
[01:47:42.998 --> 01:47:46.999]  And then the guy yells, you know, don't, you know, don't stay in the EU.
[01:47:47.339 --> 01:47:48.320]  And then shoots her.
[01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:49.820]  In England, she's dead.
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:51.201]  Member of Parliament, we're going to find out.
[01:47:51.341 --> 01:47:51.981]  Is this way with the
[01:47:52.521 --> 01:47:56.704]  Red shirt, the sympathy vote to make sure that the UK stays in the EU.
[01:47:56.724 --> 01:48:00.646]  We're going to find out from Paul Watson at least his latest first look from London straight ahead.
[01:48:00.666 --> 01:48:02.868]  But let's go out to break with the 16-year-old.
[01:48:02.888 --> 01:48:04.349]  It's a 10-minute clip and only two minutes of it.
[01:48:04.369 --> 01:48:09.992]  16-year-old, black Trump supporter, school's leftist, Black Lives Matter ding-dong.
[01:48:10.233 --> 01:48:10.593]  Here it is.
[01:48:13.975 --> 01:48:16.637]  T-R-U-N-B, we're gonna drop Hillary!
[01:48:17.158 --> 01:48:20.180]  T-R-U-N-B, we're gonna drop Hillary!
[01:48:20.241 --> 01:48:21.201]  That's real sad.
[01:48:21.261 --> 01:48:22.042]  He's against you.
[01:48:28.297 --> 01:48:31.278]  Why would you support a racist?
[01:48:31.479 --> 01:48:34.940]  He's gonna send you back to Africa, that's what he's saying.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:39.382]  He's gonna send Mexicans back to Mexico.
[01:48:39.662 --> 01:48:44.945]  You are a disgrace to America for being a young black man supporting a racist.
[01:48:44.965 --> 01:48:45.365]  Thank you.
[01:48:45.425 --> 01:48:46.966]  Yeah, and it's awesome.
[01:48:47.726 --> 01:48:51.049]  Telling him that you're not a real black man.
[01:48:51.089 --> 01:48:54.793]  You can't be a black man if you support somebody like Donald Trump.
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:05.162]  He sent Mexicans back to Mexico!
[01:49:05.342 --> 01:49:07.505]  He said don't let Muslims here!
[01:49:07.765 --> 01:49:07.845]  Why?
[01:49:07.865 --> 01:49:10.808]  Are you going to let me talk or are you going to yell?
[01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:13.011]  No, I'm telling you because- And that's what it is.
[01:49:13.051 --> 01:49:13.972]  They don't want you to talk.
[01:49:14.012 --> 01:49:15.093]  They just want to yell at you.
[01:49:15.113 --> 01:49:19.037]  He doesn't want any type of real debate, any type of real discussion with this young man.
[01:49:19.057 --> 01:49:20.359]  He just wants to yell at him.
[01:49:20.379 --> 01:49:25.084]  These talking points that he's been convinced of by whoever, which are completely false.
[01:49:25.484 --> 01:49:29.506]  When a racist Tim sent Mexicans back to Mexico.
[01:49:29.626 --> 01:49:32.347]  I asked this guy, Mexico deports almost everybody.
[01:49:32.487 --> 01:49:33.768]  I don't get it.
[01:49:33.808 --> 01:49:36.149]  We have one of the most open things in the world and he's saying we're evil.
[01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:38.450]  Illegals!
[01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:39.091]  Illegals!
[01:49:39.371 --> 01:49:42.492]  I would have loved to have asked him, why are you wearing that rainbow flag and hating Trump?
[01:49:42.512 --> 01:49:44.453]  I bet he would have said Trump did it.
[01:49:44.493 --> 01:49:46.554]  Well, you said people were saying Trump's fault for Orlando.
[01:49:47.715 --> 01:49:49.676]  Trump's fault is for everything.
[01:49:50.316 --> 01:49:52.157]  If you get in a car wreck today, it's Donald Trump's fault.
[01:49:52.858 --> 01:49:53.299]  That's fine.
[01:49:53.339 --> 01:49:53.879]  That's fine.
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:54.520]  Thank you.
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:54.680]  Yeah.
[01:50:09.901 --> 01:50:11.582]  I love how the young man's trying to talk to him.
[01:50:11.602 --> 01:50:12.642]  He's like a teenager.
[01:50:12.882 --> 01:50:13.263]  Yeah, he's 16.
[01:50:13.443 --> 01:50:15.824]  And then you got this guy just completely angry.
[01:50:31.431 --> 01:50:36.273]  And of course you can ask him, why does Trump have record numbers of black supporters compared to other Republican candidates?
[01:50:36.293 --> 01:50:39.795]  These Republicans get 10%, he's got like 25 in polls?
[01:50:40.195 --> 01:50:41.195]  Yeah, I love this lady.
[01:50:42.716 --> 01:50:45.017]  There wasn't her two cents.
[01:50:45.117 --> 01:50:47.838]  Yeah, I'm gonna skip this break.
[01:50:47.858 --> 01:50:48.539]  Just this one today.
[01:50:48.619 --> 01:50:49.299]  I just can't help it.
[01:50:50.608 --> 01:50:55.111]  Again, Jakari, describe this for radio listeners exactly where you are in Atlanta.
[01:50:55.271 --> 01:50:58.394]  So where this is, this is the Fox Theater in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:50:58.514 --> 01:51:00.215]  This is footage from yesterday.
[01:51:00.235 --> 01:51:04.778]  And there's a crowd of maybe three to four hundred people there at any given time.
[01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:14.084]  And particularly what this is, this is a lady who's now joining to the debate and she's arguing with not just the younger man, the 16-year-old, but also his friends, his high school friends.
[01:51:20.609 --> 01:51:22.490]  I worked for our president twice.
[01:51:22.711 --> 01:51:25.433]  Okay, one of the worst guys ever, but okay.
[01:51:25.493 --> 01:51:26.654]  Yeah, one of the worst guys ever.
[01:51:26.694 --> 01:51:28.175]  Let's look at the condition of our country.
[01:51:28.195 --> 01:51:30.516]  This country was built on love, not hate.
[01:51:30.837 --> 01:51:32.037]  Donald Trump- It's like a cult.
[01:51:32.078 --> 01:51:33.599]  They all just say the same stupid stuff.
[01:51:33.719 --> 01:51:34.219]  It is.
[01:51:34.279 --> 01:51:39.003]  They get the same talking points from wherever, and they just repeat them as if they're gospel.
[01:51:39.203 --> 01:51:40.924]  People believe in hate.
[01:51:41.384 --> 01:51:44.927]  Do you know the history of his grandfather and father?
[01:51:44.947 --> 01:51:46.248]  They were KK members.
[01:51:46.894 --> 01:51:47.074]  What?
[01:51:47.335 --> 01:51:50.479]  Y'all don't listen to what he says, the young boy.
[01:51:50.519 --> 01:51:52.121]  Go Google it.
[01:51:52.201 --> 01:51:53.623]  Go Google it.
[01:51:53.683 --> 01:51:55.366]  He says you Google it.
[01:51:55.846 --> 01:51:57.929]  But I mean that would be all over the news if that was the case.
[01:51:58.049 --> 01:51:58.670]  Oh yeah.
[01:51:58.710 --> 01:52:01.014]  I don't know where these guys get this information.
[01:52:02.774 --> 01:52:05.696]  I'll come back and say Hillary was brought into politics by Grand Dragon.
[01:52:05.716 --> 01:52:08.017]  Yeah, and I was like, she went to a KKK funeral.
[01:52:08.057 --> 01:52:09.077]  Who's against your color?
[01:52:09.097 --> 01:52:11.839]  Nothing about the Clintons and the Dixie Mafia.
[01:52:11.879 --> 01:52:14.540]  I think the Democratic Party founded the KKK, by the way.
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:15.180]  Just saying.
[01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:16.481]  Let me tell you.
[01:52:16.501 --> 01:52:17.481]  God, I love the debate.
[01:52:28.613 --> 01:52:32.077]  Yeah, it's quite the scene.
[01:52:32.297 --> 01:52:36.601]  We should take this footage and put it over at her with the plan and just show all the stuff.
[01:52:36.781 --> 01:52:38.823]  I mean, yeah, you can do a lot of stuff with it.
[01:52:38.983 --> 01:52:40.965]  I mean, oh, this is amazing.
[01:52:40.985 --> 01:52:44.589]  We got Carl the Cuck, we got Aiden Skrillex, we got Triggly Puff.
[01:52:44.609 --> 01:52:45.670]  What would this guy's name be?
[01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:47.071]  Rainbow Dummy?
[01:52:47.832 --> 01:52:51.515]  I'm not the best at names, but I'm sure somebody will come up with something.
[01:52:53.044 --> 01:52:55.286]  I think Trigger the Puff is probably my favorite name.
[01:52:55.306 --> 01:52:55.827]  Look at his wife!
[01:52:56.327 --> 01:52:57.388]  How do you think she got here?
[01:52:57.488 --> 01:52:58.149]  She's legal!
[01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:59.570]  She's not legal!
[01:52:59.891 --> 01:53:03.314]  There's a way to legally immigrate.
[01:53:04.095 --> 01:53:04.635]  Exactly.
[01:53:04.695 --> 01:53:05.336]  That was before.
[01:53:05.616 --> 01:53:09.740]  You can't bring people in now and have welfare and infrastructure and give it away free or you collapse.
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:12.222]  People weren't getting welfare 300 years ago coming here.
[01:53:12.242 --> 01:53:12.943]  It was hell on earth.
[01:53:14.332 --> 01:53:15.733]  Everybody just keeps living in the past, man.
[01:53:15.773 --> 01:53:16.573]  I tell you, this is crazy.
[01:53:16.673 --> 01:53:16.813]  Alright.
[01:53:17.073 --> 01:53:21.395]  Full videos up on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Jakari Jackson riding shotgun with us.
[01:53:21.675 --> 01:53:34.741]  We now shift gears to Labor MP, Member of Parliament, Jo Cox, has died after being shot three times in the street near her office by an attacker who shouted, Britain first, then kicked her while she lay bleeding.
[01:53:35.142 --> 01:53:37.643]  And the first reports were that she was in labor, that she was probably
[01:53:38.223 --> 01:53:50.366]  For the British exit, or the Brexit, but now they're saying, no, no, she was for staying in the EU, and that he reportedly yelled, shouted Britain first, and kicked her while she lay bleeding, and stabbed her.
[01:53:50.646 --> 01:53:52.927]  The big question is, how do you get a gun in a gun-free zone?
[01:53:53.527 --> 01:53:54.708]  What are they going to turn this into?
[01:53:54.768 --> 01:53:56.568]  Oh, you got to stay in the unelected EU now?
[01:53:56.968 --> 01:53:58.169]  Because somebody got shot?
[01:53:58.909 --> 01:54:02.490]  This is developing quick, but Paul Watson always seems to have the answers on this.
[01:54:02.850 --> 01:54:05.431]  Paul Joseph Watson from London, England.
[01:54:05.731 --> 01:54:06.611]  Paul, what have you learned?
[01:54:08.288 --> 01:54:10.950]  Well, first of all, she is a left-wing politician.
[01:54:10.990 --> 01:54:12.551]  She's for the Remain campaign.
[01:54:13.172 --> 01:54:19.497]  But the truth about this is this so-called shout of Britain first seems like it's complete BS.
[01:54:19.537 --> 01:54:24.161]  They've gone back and asked the eyewitnesses who have said that he didn't say Britain first.
[01:54:24.581 --> 01:54:26.703]  Now it's emerged that he's mentally ill.
[01:54:27.103 --> 01:54:28.264]  He was on medication.
[01:54:28.304 --> 01:54:29.145]  I predicted that.
[01:54:29.625 --> 01:54:30.806]  I predicted that in the first segment.
[01:54:31.727 --> 01:54:35.670]  And he didn't shout anything political before he attacked and killed her.
[01:54:36.071 --> 01:54:37.892]  But you know, it doesn't really matter to the left.
[01:54:38.312 --> 01:54:40.514]  This is the not-all-Muslims crowd.
[01:54:40.574 --> 01:54:44.738]  After every single Islamist terror attack, they come out and say, don't blame all Muslims.
[01:54:45.158 --> 01:54:54.946]  But immediately, within minutes, you could go on Twitter, they were all blaming conservatives, people who want to get out of the EU, lumping everybody in with this.
[01:54:54.966 --> 01:54:58.249]  Okay, but am I wrong in saying that a lot of Labour people actually want to get out too now, though?
[01:54:58.269 --> 01:54:59.290]  I mean, even the Mayor of London.
[01:55:00.793 --> 01:55:07.052]  No, a lot of people within Labour, including the leader of Labour, but he won't campaign on it, do want to leave the EU.
[01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:17.573]  But again, the eyewitnesses are now coming out and saying that this claim that the killer shouted Britain first is not true.
[01:55:18.254 --> 01:55:20.875]  Yet still people are all over Twitter claiming it is.
[01:55:21.375 --> 01:55:23.896]  The other angle to it is that, I mean, I predicted this.
[01:55:24.457 --> 01:55:30.940]  I tweet so much I can't even find the tweet anymore, but I've said it many times as the thunder roars outside my window.
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:33.161]  You said two weeks ago there'll be some event on this show
[01:55:33.861 --> 01:55:40.485]  Some type of terror attack or something so they can, you know, make people that are against leaving look like terrorists.
[01:55:41.586 --> 01:55:45.148]  Yeah, and Charlie Skelton, who you had on last week, predicted it as well.
[01:55:45.188 --> 01:55:52.532]  He said, I'll not be surprised if there's a big noisy security terror scare just pre-referendum that's best dealt with by the UK being in the EU.
[01:55:52.912 --> 01:55:55.394]  Which, of course, they're going to blame it on people who want to leave the EU.
[01:55:55.874 --> 01:56:00.537]  The article I've got up on InfoWars.com right now goes through that, some of the examples.
[01:56:00.677 --> 01:56:02.398]  Oh wow, you already wrote an article in the last 30 minutes?
[01:56:02.418 --> 01:56:05.340]  Well, let's put it up on screen right now for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:08.682]  Paul Joseph Watson has an article out, and I'll let you go quick so you can add more to it.
[01:56:08.702 --> 01:56:11.383]  But wow, so the witnesses are saying, didn't say this.
[01:56:11.783 --> 01:56:21.289]  This stinks to high heaven, because they usually have some mentally ill wind-up toy, who is a leftist, who they bring in to do it, to create the sympathy, and then basically you add the political statements later.
[01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:26.132]  The political establishment will exploit the murder of Joe Cox to kill Brexit.
[01:56:27.052 --> 01:56:32.704]  Not all Muslims crowd will blame the vote leave conservatives for shooting MP.
[01:56:32.724 --> 01:56:33.225]  Good point, Paul.
[01:56:34.614 --> 01:56:37.556]  Yeah, I mean, here's a quote from somebody prominent on Twitter.
[01:56:38.016 --> 01:56:40.797]  These Brexit hardliners are getting out of control.
[01:56:40.877 --> 01:56:43.439]  My thoughts go out to Joe Cox's family and friends.
[01:56:43.879 --> 01:56:50.582]  There are others who are talking about this is the responsibility of people who want to limit immigration into the United Kingdom.
[01:56:51.042 --> 01:57:00.347]  Like, having a problem with 330,000 people coming in every single year means you sympathize with some mentally ill person who's just killed an MP.
[01:57:00.747 --> 01:57:03.709]  And by the way, we know the numbers are higher than that, Paul, but I want to say this.
[01:57:04.349 --> 01:57:06.590]  Just like they've stolen the delegates from Bernie Sanders.
[01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:11.651]  When they really start cancelling elections, when is the point you can physically resist?
[01:57:11.671 --> 01:57:13.271]  I mean, I'm not saying that she should have gotten killed.
[01:57:13.952 --> 01:57:14.672]  I think it's terrible.
[01:57:14.912 --> 01:57:17.412]  But, I mean, the French were occupied by a foreign power.
[01:57:17.712 --> 01:57:24.014]  If you're occupied by an unelected EU that you didn't vote to enter, at what point are you not allowed to stand up and say no?
[01:57:24.714 --> 01:57:30.296]  I mean, to use the slave analogy, say, you know, 200 years ago in this country or whatever, I'd just say I'm not a slave and beat your brains out.
[01:57:31.656 --> 01:57:33.997]  At what point does it start getting too violent, Jakari?
[01:57:34.738 --> 01:57:39.820]  I don't know, but it's definitely sad that this young lady, or this Prime Minister, lost her life.
[01:57:41.281 --> 01:57:42.622]  We'll just see what develops.
[01:57:43.202 --> 01:57:51.827]  Absolutely, but my point is, I'm not saying there should be any violence, but at a certain point, if an unelected government is over you, what do you do to resist that?
[01:57:52.407 --> 01:57:53.268]  Just stop complying?
[01:57:53.668 --> 01:57:54.288]  Non-violently?
[01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:55.909]  That's a start.
[01:57:56.489 --> 01:57:57.470]  That's what Martin Luther King did.
[01:58:00.373 --> 01:58:02.373]  Paul, what do you think about that angle?
[01:58:03.654 --> 01:58:26.439]  Well, I mean, it's difficult to not comply when you can't sell your product to the EU market without imposing their onerous regulations, 100% of which are applied to small businesses in the UK, like the salmon griller in London, who sold fish and had to put a thing on his packaging saying, contains fish, to comply with EU regulations, almost put him out of business.
[01:58:26.899 --> 01:58:29.760]  Those are the people who are affected by this, and this stinks to high heaven.
[01:58:30.473 --> 01:58:31.013]  Absolutely.
[01:58:31.054 --> 01:58:31.674]  Paul, stay there.
[01:58:31.694 --> 01:58:32.415]  Jakari, stay there.
[01:58:32.675 --> 01:58:33.755]  Five more minutes with both of you.
[01:58:33.956 --> 01:58:35.597]  Then we have another special guest joining us.
[01:58:35.977 --> 01:58:38.839]  We're getting to the bottom of what just happened with this Member of Parliament.
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:43.663]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.703 --> 01:58:45.744]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.208 --> 01:58:57.373]  The Orlando mass murderer, who targeted homosexuals, was a regular at the Pulse nightclub, reports the London Guardian.
[01:58:57.594 --> 01:59:03.578]  Customers had seen the killer there before, and several reported getting messages from him on gay dating apps.
[01:59:03.738 --> 01:59:05.800]  The FBI is investigating that claim.
[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:15.087]  One patron said, sometimes he would go over in the corner and sit and drink by himself, and other times he would get so drunk he was loud and belligerent.
[01:59:15.307 --> 01:59:20.308]  We didn't really talk to him a lot, but I remember him saying things about his dad at times.
[01:59:20.468 --> 01:59:22.749]  He told us he had a wife and child.
[01:59:23.049 --> 01:59:30.491]  Jim Van Horn, age 71, told the Associated Press of Mateen, he was a homosexual and he was trying to pick up men.
[01:59:30.711 --> 01:59:34.531]  He would walk up to them and then maybe put his arm around them or something.
[01:59:34.692 --> 01:59:36.532]  That's what people do at gay bars.
[01:59:36.872 --> 01:59:43.914]  I think it's possible that he was trying to deal with his inner demons, trying to get rid of his anger of homosexuality, he added.
[01:59:44.094 --> 01:59:47.715]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:59:52.116 --> 01:59:54.757]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:00.953 --> 02:00:07.037]  They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[02:00:09.118 --> 02:00:15.143]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[02:00:15.183 --> 02:00:18.205]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.590 --> 02:00:22.931]  Gary Jackson's riding shotgun with us for the rest of this segment.
[02:00:23.391 --> 02:00:24.272]  So is Paul Watson.
[02:00:24.292 --> 02:00:32.055]  I was kind of ranting last segment, but speaking of free speech, they're trying to ban our free speech and say you can't have a Trump rally.
[02:00:32.555 --> 02:00:36.777]  And so we've got the organizers of that joining us to talk about that in the next segment that ties into all this.
[02:00:37.637 --> 02:00:44.424]  You know, Mahatma Gandhi's March to the Sea, that was successful against the British being non-violent, but they stopped paying the SALT tax and other things.
[02:00:44.865 --> 02:00:46.486]  So there's got to be some non-compliance.
[02:00:46.526 --> 02:00:53.694]  And Paul, where does this go if the British exiting the EU, the Brexit, fails?
[02:00:54.254 --> 02:00:55.355]  Or do you think that they'll cheat?
[02:00:55.375 --> 02:00:57.017]  I mean, what are the tea leaves saying?
[02:00:58.579 --> 02:01:00.561]  Well, the polls over the past week have been
[02:01:01.363 --> 02:01:02.223]  You know, pro-leave.
[02:01:02.263 --> 02:01:03.504]  They've swung the opposite way.
[02:01:03.564 --> 02:01:06.005]  At one point they swung 13 points the other way.
[02:01:06.025 --> 02:01:08.947]  There's a poll out today where vote-leave is four points ahead.
[02:01:09.307 --> 02:01:16.290]  So they differ, but they're all in favour of vote-leave compared to a month or so ago, six weeks ago, when they were all in favour of vote-remain.
[02:01:19.912 --> 02:01:23.774]  Actually go out and vote because they're psychologically averse to change.
[02:01:23.854 --> 02:01:25.694]  That's what the establishment relies on.
[02:01:25.975 --> 02:01:29.216]  People freaking out and not voting for change when it actually counts.
[02:01:29.236 --> 02:01:30.837]  Do you think Scotland really voted to stay in?
[02:01:32.509 --> 02:01:52.498]  Well it was very close and there were some shenanigans with that, but what's even more concerning is MPs are people... noises to the fact that even if the British people vote to leave Europe, they will ignore the vote, like the EU has done in many different countries, and they will simply say...
[02:01:56.269 --> 02:01:58.591]  ...debate whether we want to leave in Parliament.
[02:01:58.671 --> 02:02:00.552]  And then have another vote, another vote, another vote.
[02:02:00.572 --> 02:02:01.353]  Just like Ireland.
[02:02:01.513 --> 02:02:02.354]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:02:02.394 --> 02:02:03.334]  It's just incredible.
[02:02:04.555 --> 02:02:06.497]  What does your gut tell you about next week?
[02:02:06.817 --> 02:02:08.278]  That they will exit or they won't exit?
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:16.125]  Um, I'm more hopeful over the past week because the polls are showing that Vote Leave is pulling ahead.
[02:02:16.205 --> 02:02:19.168]  But, you know, I think they'll pull something.
[02:02:19.188 --> 02:02:20.449]  I think they'll pull another stunt.
[02:02:20.829 --> 02:02:25.253]  Even though now it's just come out that this killer had, quote, no political views.
[02:02:25.293 --> 02:02:27.334]  He said nothing about the EU referendum.
[02:02:27.695 --> 02:02:28.856]  Doesn't matter to the left.
[02:02:28.956 --> 02:02:32.699]  They will still frame everybody in this same extremist... They will still just say it.
[02:02:32.759 --> 02:02:36.262]  Well, how do you get a gun when it's nearly impossible to get one there?
[02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:40.921]  Managed to get one.
[02:02:40.961 --> 02:02:44.803]  So those gun control laws didn't work because criminals don't obey laws.
[02:02:44.843 --> 02:02:45.624]  Surprise, surprise.
[02:02:45.644 --> 02:02:46.204]  That's right.
[02:02:46.224 --> 02:02:49.567]  You know, I'm more hopeful than I was a month ago about Brexit.
[02:02:49.647 --> 02:02:50.508]  Let's just put it that way.
[02:02:50.548 --> 02:02:51.588]  We've got the momentum.
[02:02:51.628 --> 02:02:55.271]  If we continue to carry that forward, it's going to be a vote leave.
[02:02:55.671 --> 02:02:56.172]  Absolutely.
[02:02:56.212 --> 02:02:58.153]  Paul, you're going to be hosting some coming up next week.
[02:02:58.193 --> 02:02:59.114]  So let's check your Skype.
[02:02:59.174 --> 02:02:59.934]  It's having some hiccups.
[02:02:59.954 --> 02:03:00.335]  Great job.
[02:03:00.375 --> 02:03:00.635]  Thank you.
[02:03:01.561 --> 02:03:01.981]  Thanks Alex.
[02:03:22.333 --> 02:03:34.158]  International news, when it's a big politician or a police officer, but these things happen every single day, but they won't tell you about some housewife who got stabbed to death, or, you know, some kid at a bus stop, you know, who got slashed or stabbed.
[02:03:34.478 --> 02:03:39.160]  They only want to tell you about, you know, when it's big, sensational, it's the AR-15, it's something that we can blame.
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:40.721]  That's when it's a news story.
[02:03:41.241 --> 02:03:43.362]  Just like this alligator eating this kid.
[02:03:43.462 --> 02:03:45.643]  I mean, it's sad, but is it the biggest story in the world?
[02:03:45.703 --> 02:03:46.543]  No, it's sensational.
[02:03:47.203 --> 02:03:49.024]  And so they can... It's very unique.
[02:03:49.424 --> 02:03:50.405]  It's very unique in that regard.
[02:03:50.425 --> 02:03:50.665]  It's unique.
[02:03:51.585 --> 02:03:54.986]  It's not going to be unique soon if they don't start killing some alligators, but those things are all over the place now.
[02:03:55.806 --> 02:03:57.606]  I saw one cross the highway in South Texas.
[02:03:57.826 --> 02:03:59.667]  My son went out and killed three of them two years ago.
[02:04:00.147 --> 02:04:00.407]  Oh yeah?
[02:04:00.587 --> 02:04:02.488]  Oh yeah, you can get alligator hunting licenses now.
[02:04:02.508 --> 02:04:04.688]  He killed, the biggest one was 11 feet.
[02:04:06.008 --> 02:04:12.530]  But yeah, when we just continue to look at all these things and how they continue to blame people, as Paul was saying, they'll blame a group that had nothing to do with
[02:04:13.110 --> 02:04:15.211]  A particular incident, but now it's their fault.
[02:04:15.711 --> 02:04:26.475]  And I was talking to somebody at the event, they don't want to talk on camera, but in Atlanta, she was anti-Trump because she said Trump was politicizing or taking advantage of the Orlando shooting to push forward agenda.
[02:04:26.775 --> 02:04:29.416]  And I said, it took Hillary 10 minutes to come out and blame gun owners.
[02:04:29.436 --> 02:04:29.976]  Like, what are you saying?
[02:04:30.016 --> 02:04:31.817]  That's a complete double standard, you know?
[02:04:31.837 --> 02:04:39.380]  So you have to look at these things very objectively and see that these political politicos are going to take advantage of the situation regardless of what it is.
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:39.820]  They are.
[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:41.142]  Well, great job in Atlanta.
[02:04:41.162 --> 02:04:41.963]  We've got our reporters.
[02:04:42.423 --> 02:04:43.945]  Who did we send up to Dallas?
[02:04:43.965 --> 02:04:45.166]  I believe it was Biggs and Kidd.
[02:04:45.907 --> 02:04:46.748]  Biggs and Kidd.
[02:04:47.268 --> 02:04:47.989]  That should be interesting.
[02:04:48.009 --> 02:04:49.531]  They're on their way up to the Trump rally.
[02:04:49.551 --> 02:04:50.632]  7 o'clock tonight it kicks off.
[02:04:50.652 --> 02:04:51.473]  They'll have live feeds.
[02:04:51.753 --> 02:04:53.455]  Before that, the Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:04:53.695 --> 02:04:54.476]  Who's hosting the news tonight?
[02:04:54.957 --> 02:04:55.697]  Leanne McAtee.
[02:04:55.717 --> 02:04:56.278]  Leanne McAtee.
[02:04:56.298 --> 02:04:57.279]  Thank you, Jakari Jackson.
[02:04:57.319 --> 02:04:57.780]  We'll be back.
[02:05:00.366 --> 02:05:11.604]  Everyone, Obama and Trump, as well as the NRA and LGBT lobbyists, are saying the Orlando shooting requires new gun control measures because it's now an issue of national security.
[02:05:11.824 --> 02:05:14.869]  Democrats in Congress just ended a 15 hour filibuster
[02:05:15.069 --> 02:05:21.092]  Republicans have caved and said they will hold a vote on whether to block people who have just been labeled a terrorist.
[02:05:21.272 --> 02:05:24.254]  Remember, this is secretly and without trial.
[02:05:24.514 --> 02:05:30.938]  People are put on terror watch lists and no-fly watch lists without their knowledge, without being told of the charges against them.
[02:05:31.138 --> 02:05:35.540]  Without being able to confront their accusers in an open trial by jury.
[02:05:35.701 --> 02:05:39.082]  Now we're going to apply punishments and sanctions against them.
[02:05:39.303 --> 02:05:43.265]  This is a star chamber process that the Bill of Rights was written to stop.
[02:05:43.485 --> 02:05:46.086]  Terror attacks are not a gun control issue.
[02:05:46.126 --> 02:05:47.867]  They're a border control issue.
[02:05:48.027 --> 02:05:53.130]  Without background checks for migrants, terrorists are free to use nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.
[02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:57.192]  A rifle may be your only defense against that kind of weapon.
[02:05:57.393 --> 02:05:59.314]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:06:00.259 --> 02:06:12.824]  The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, as summarized by the Senate Armed Services Committee, proposes a 25% reduction in generals and admirals across the board, reports the Daily Caller.
[02:06:13.064 --> 02:06:21.788]  A summary of the bill provided by the committee states the drawdown in general officers also applies at the 3, 2, and 1 star levels.
[02:06:22.028 --> 02:06:33.121]  The committee reasons that over the past 30 years, the in-strength of the joint force has decreased 38%, but the ratio of 4-star officers to the overall force has increased by 65%.
[02:06:33.421 --> 02:06:39.368]  The bill's summary explains that by making heavy cuts at the 3 and 4-star level,
[02:06:39.648 --> 02:06:43.270]  It can allow the services a broader base to develop future leaders.
[02:06:43.470 --> 02:06:55.737]  The summary also cites budget concerns as a reason for the reduction, saying that the Pentagon must proactively work to shift as many personnel as possible from staff functions to operational and other vital roles.
[02:06:55.918 --> 02:06:59.720]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:01.451 --> 02:07:07.795]  I got so busy fighting the Globals for 15 years, I turned into a giant fat slob when I was an exercise fanatic before.
[02:07:08.195 --> 02:07:11.297]  Now in the last five years, I set out to try to get back in shape.
[02:07:11.697 --> 02:07:23.565]  And to help turbocharge that, I talked to top scientists and nutraceutical developers and said I want something that blocks these estrogen mimickers, something that helps me get back to what a real male was like instead of this Globals bombardment.
[02:07:24.125 --> 02:07:26.906]  We developed Super Male and Super Female Vitality.

[02:08:00.306 --> 02:08:05.150]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:06.011]  Watch me!
[02:08:13.135 --> 02:08:13.675]  I got it.
[02:08:14.496 --> 02:08:14.976]  Hey!
[02:08:16.056 --> 02:08:19.238]  I got something that makes me wanna shout.
[02:08:19.598 --> 02:08:22.539]  I got something that tells me what it's all about.
[02:08:22.919 --> 02:08:26.961]  I got soul, and I'm super bad.
[02:08:38.582 --> 02:08:42.723]  Tim Salady is going to be our guest to the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:42.743 --> 02:08:46.364]  He's an avid conservative grassroots activist.
[02:08:47.184 --> 02:08:51.405]  His current mission is reviving his fellow citizens' passion for American patriotism.
[02:08:52.565 --> 02:09:00.967]  And he heads up AmericaFirstMovement.com that Roger Stone and some of the Trump folks everybody says is really one of the best organizations out there.
[02:09:01.007 --> 02:09:02.568]  And they've organized in Cleveland
[02:09:03.368 --> 02:09:08.512]  First stop the Steele demonstration, but now that they've backed off that, at least on the surface, they're still going to try and watch.
[02:09:09.633 --> 02:09:17.058]  Having folks come out and just demonstrate with the First Amendment and support of the electoral process is just a free speech rally, slash victory rally.
[02:09:17.619 --> 02:09:18.940]  The DNC is going to be having those.
[02:09:19.901 --> 02:09:23.924]  Oh, but Cleveland's trying to restrict the time and put people miles away.
[02:09:23.944 --> 02:09:25.445]  The ACLU has come out.
[02:09:26.673 --> 02:09:28.694]  And said, this is onerous, this is wrong.
[02:09:29.235 --> 02:09:31.616]  And they want folks to sign on who are going to be part of this lawsuit.
[02:09:32.277 --> 02:09:33.758]  And they've asked me to be part of that.
[02:09:33.778 --> 02:09:35.479]  I'm certainly happy to be a plaintiff in that.
[02:09:35.499 --> 02:09:36.180]  I intend to be there.
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:40.302]  It's a rally that I started organizing six months ago with Roger Stone.
[02:09:41.543 --> 02:09:42.744]  So Tim is working on that.
[02:09:43.004 --> 02:09:51.910]  After he leaves us, I'm going to get into the latest on Russia says it might now, or NATO says it might now have grounds to attack Russia.
[02:09:53.139 --> 02:09:56.886]  We've got more publications coming out saying repeal the Second Amendment, not just Rolling Stone.
[02:09:57.668 --> 02:10:03.419]  We have hackers release secret Clinton docs from State Department DNC's Trump opposition file donor list.
[02:10:04.810 --> 02:10:07.872]  We have just a lot of really important news.
[02:10:08.432 --> 02:10:12.134]  We're going to be getting to Trump may launch his own cable network to counter all this.
[02:10:12.835 --> 02:10:17.698]  Well, you know, they're going to try to send in the Federal Elections Commission and claim that that's political speech and you can't have it.
[02:10:18.919 --> 02:10:20.319]  But I say under free speech, let them have it.
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:24.702]  I mean, the globalists, all these foreign interests, own media and sit here and bombard us with political news.
[02:10:24.942 --> 02:10:25.763]  They just claim it isn't.
[02:10:26.843 --> 02:10:27.644]  I say free-for-all.
[02:10:27.664 --> 02:10:30.688]  We got the Saudis and the communists, Chinese funding Hillary.
[02:10:30.708 --> 02:10:31.429]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:10:32.009 --> 02:10:33.091]  He can have a cable network.
[02:10:34.132 --> 02:10:35.073]  Here's the article we wrote.
[02:10:35.113 --> 02:10:37.436]  Cleveland to ban Trump supporters outside RNC.
[02:10:37.856 --> 02:10:42.041]  Democratic city fueling anti-Trump protest to make Hillary look good.
[02:10:42.962 --> 02:10:45.183]  And so, Tim, thank you for joining us.
[02:10:45.223 --> 02:10:48.465]  CitizensforTrump.com, PatrioticWarriors.com.
[02:10:49.125 --> 02:10:55.888]  Tim, what do we need to do to make sure... I mean, obviously, everybody should just show up regardless, and I'm going to be there.
[02:10:55.928 --> 02:10:57.809]  I'm going to exercise my First Amendment.
[02:10:58.109 --> 02:10:58.910]  I mean, is that accurate?
[02:10:58.930 --> 02:10:59.350]  What should we do?
[02:11:00.384 --> 02:11:02.526]  Hey, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:11:02.586 --> 02:11:03.347]  I appreciate it.
[02:11:03.987 --> 02:11:19.361]  So, yeah, I mean, again, we first started out trying to have a rally of sorts to protest the RNC stealing Mr. Trump's nomination, but after we seen that wasn't going to happen, of course we just wanted to have a celebratory parade and
[02:11:20.365 --> 02:11:20.705]  I don't
[02:11:37.065 --> 02:11:39.346]  Funny enough, ours isn't on that approval list.
[02:11:39.366 --> 02:11:42.647]  All of them are leftist or communist or anti-Trump groups.
[02:11:43.127 --> 02:11:51.650]  So we're still sitting here, even though we're the top plaintiff on the lawsuit against the city, they haven't even bothered to respond to me personally or the law team.
[02:11:52.091 --> 02:11:54.572]  So at this point, you know, we don't know what we're doing.
[02:11:54.592 --> 02:11:57.172]  But you're right, a lot of people are still going to show up.
[02:11:57.293 --> 02:12:06.416]  But unfortunately, the city has made three convergent points that are very, you know, I would say are a scenario for violence to happen.
[02:12:06.889 --> 02:12:08.450]  Well, Tim, it's just incredible.
[02:12:09.150 --> 02:12:10.391]  It's a First Amendment issue.
[02:12:10.431 --> 02:12:11.612]  I know the police are supportive.
[02:12:12.973 --> 02:12:19.116]  And then you're going to have the Black Lives Matter group, the communists, the Soros groups being able to do whatever they want.
[02:12:19.577 --> 02:12:20.897]  But here's the RNC.
[02:12:20.957 --> 02:12:21.878]  Trump's inside.
[02:12:22.518 --> 02:12:24.439]  People are trying to organize something outside.
[02:12:24.940 --> 02:12:25.980]  And they're saying no.
[02:12:26.721 --> 02:12:29.282]  I hope Trump gets involved in this, not just the lawsuit.
[02:12:29.582 --> 02:12:33.665]  But let's talk about the technicals, the history of this, the lawsuit, and where it's going.
[02:12:33.705 --> 02:12:34.946]  And I want to tell viewers and listeners,
[02:12:35.666 --> 02:12:37.107]  I'm going to be there even more now.
[02:12:37.527 --> 02:12:46.533]  I know as libertarians or conservatives or folks, we don't want to go just stir up trouble like a bunch of communists, but they're violating our rights saying only communists can basically march in America.
[02:12:46.853 --> 02:12:49.475]  We have to take our free speech and our First Amendment back.
[02:12:50.956 --> 02:12:52.376]  Yes, that's absolutely right.
[02:12:52.937 --> 02:13:02.959]  And, you know, again, with them only approving all the left-wing, so to speak, or anti-Trump groups at this point, one, it's adding a little bit more validity to our free speech being violated.
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:06.821]  And secondarily, again, it's a recipe for disaster.
[02:13:06.841 --> 02:13:12.222]  You have to understand that these groups are coming not, you know, to peaceably protest.
[02:13:12.262 --> 02:13:18.504]  They're coming to protest in the same fashion they did in California, New Mexico, and a few other places.
[02:13:19.324 --> 02:13:23.187]  We know that the city has taken out a massive insurance policy.
[02:13:23.687 --> 02:13:24.648]  And what does that mean?
[02:13:25.048 --> 02:13:33.193]  Well, you know, I love the police department and all, but what it does mean is that no matter what happens there, it's going to be covered under that insurance policy.
[02:13:33.654 --> 02:13:47.263]  So, you know, I'm not saying that the police are going to conduct themselves in any less professional manner, but, you know, there's a big difference when you're personally responsible and liable for your conduct as opposed to being covered under a blanket insurance policy.
[02:13:48.483 --> 02:13:58.167]  Well, there's a big problem here in that clearly they're saying, we're going to let the leftists run around and do whatever they want, but we're not going to allow citizens out here that support Trump, who are the vast majority of people, obviously.
[02:13:58.227 --> 02:14:00.608]  So this is just incredible discrimination.
[02:14:00.868 --> 02:14:01.788]  Wow, they're arrogant.
[02:14:01.848 --> 02:14:07.971]  I didn't know about the new development that they've given the permits to all the Democrat groups, but not to the pro-Trump group.
[02:14:07.991 --> 02:14:08.491]  That's crazy.
[02:14:09.071 --> 02:14:09.772]  None.
[02:14:09.852 --> 02:14:16.716]  And again, we had the biggest rally planned that the city had seen.
[02:14:16.917 --> 02:14:24.022]  They even told me, wow, it's unheard of to plan a celebratory rally of this size for an RNC event like this.
[02:14:24.802 --> 02:14:30.325]  But that said, I guess the point I was making earlier is that we can go and show up, but understand this.
[02:14:30.705 --> 02:14:33.746]  If we don't get a permit, all the leftists will have a permit.
[02:14:34.166 --> 02:14:37.488]  All of us who are pro-Trump and, you know, we represent several surrogates.
[02:14:37.508 --> 02:14:48.033]  No, no, obviously we want to get the permit to really have everybody together and show it, but if not, have Rolling Thunder in, take over the streets, we'll outnumber them 5 to 1 and just, and just, just, just, it'll be huge.
[02:14:49.319 --> 02:14:58.785]  Yes, and we probably will do so, but again, unfortunately for us, is that the police will be on the side of the people with permits, if you follow what I'm saying.
[02:15:00.145 --> 02:15:00.646]  Absolutely.
[02:15:00.666 --> 02:15:05.148]  So we need to try to do this, but at the same time, that's their problem.
[02:15:05.228 --> 02:15:08.190]  If the city's corrupt and does that, we have to go ahead and go forward, as you said.
[02:15:08.812 --> 02:15:12.817]  I've been told the city won't arrest anybody for being in the street specifically.
[02:15:12.857 --> 02:15:13.858]  They won't enforce that.
[02:15:14.358 --> 02:15:16.441]  But, you know, that remains to be seen.
[02:15:16.481 --> 02:15:22.187]  But at the end of the day, I know truckers for Trump, bikers for Trump, tea partiers, students, women for Trump.
[02:15:22.628 --> 02:15:24.410]  A lot of them people are still going to come.
[02:15:25.090 --> 02:15:26.711]  Uh, you know, I know Roger's going to be there.
[02:15:26.751 --> 02:15:27.451]  We're going to be there.
[02:15:27.471 --> 02:15:32.013]  Diamond and Silk, we're going to be reporting from inside, uh, you know, the convention as well.
[02:15:32.073 --> 02:15:35.554]  But at the end of the day, we, you know, we're going to formulate a plan.
[02:15:35.594 --> 02:15:40.836]  We're going to see, we're going to give the city a couple more days to see if maybe they're trying to accommodate us and that's to delay.
[02:15:40.876 --> 02:15:42.517]  But I've got a feeling that you're correct.
[02:15:42.557 --> 02:15:48.099]  They absolutely are going to try to make a mockery of us coming and not allow us to be there legally too.
[02:15:48.908 --> 02:15:57.111]  Well, the good news is, as you know, Tim, they can claim that Trump people started the riot in Chicago, they can claim that Trump people did the stuff in Albuquerque or L.A.
[02:15:57.171 --> 02:15:57.811]  or wherever.
[02:15:58.031 --> 02:15:58.771]  All of it's bull.
[02:15:59.511 --> 02:16:03.412]  The internet and real media is bigger than the corporate media, the establishment media.
[02:16:03.913 --> 02:16:04.833]  The lies don't work.
[02:16:05.193 --> 02:16:16.797]  And when it's going to come out that the Trump people weren't given their permits, they weren't given their place, they were told they could be on the other side of the moon in a free speech zone, and they're not putting up with it, and it's going to blow up in their face yet again.
[02:16:17.137 --> 02:16:17.877]  And then when the Trump
[02:16:19.127 --> 02:16:22.689]  People are calm and nice, and the anti-Trump people act like a bunch of idiots.
[02:16:22.749 --> 02:16:24.210]  It'll only blow up in their face that much better.
[02:16:24.670 --> 02:16:34.435]  I think the best thing Trump ever does is hang out in places like, you know, New Mexico and California, where some of these crazy leftists are, just to show what morons they are.
[02:16:35.629 --> 02:16:36.690]  Well, exactly.
[02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:37.911]  And here's the other side of it.
[02:16:37.951 --> 02:16:45.760]  A lot of people tell me, and I agree to a degree, you know, maybe we should tell everybody not to go so there is no bloodshed, so there is no issue.
[02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:52.166]  But on the flip side of that is, you know, again, I think you're right if we outnumber them 5 to 1.
[02:16:53.087 --> 02:17:06.915]  We've seen in the past where wherever they congregate, Black Lives Matter or other anti-Trump or racist groups like that, and when we outnumber them, like the bikers for Trump, they typically back down and run with their tail tucked shared, so there is that.
[02:17:06.935 --> 02:17:12.719]  Well that's right, we have the numbers, we have the truth on our side, and we have the First Amendment on our side, and so...
[02:17:13.871 --> 02:17:15.633]  This is just another arrogant attempt.
[02:17:15.673 --> 02:17:19.337]  If we give in to this, pretty soon we'll be banned everywhere.
[02:17:20.078 --> 02:17:20.798]  And then it's over.
[02:17:20.839 --> 02:17:21.719]  I mean, that's what they want.
[02:17:21.739 --> 02:17:23.201]  They want to come shut down the rallies.
[02:17:23.521 --> 02:17:24.883]  They want to stop Trump from speaking.
[02:17:24.923 --> 02:17:26.104]  They want to keep people from coming.
[02:17:26.384 --> 02:17:27.045]  It's not worked.
[02:17:27.145 --> 02:17:31.270]  So I say, round of applause for the First Amendment and the American people standing up.
[02:17:31.650 --> 02:17:45.479]  And especially to all of the black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and others that I've seen in many areas who are like 30, 40, 50 percent of the folks going in being yelled at and screamed at by the anti-Trump people, you know, standing up to that type of bullying.
[02:17:45.819 --> 02:17:46.480]  I say bravo.
[02:17:47.472 --> 02:17:52.854]  The abuse has been, I mean, unprecedented just because of our choice of candidate.
[02:17:53.314 --> 02:18:02.918]  And on top of that, you know, I find it very interesting and it's heartbreaking that an attack such as the one that just happened, you know, is what it takes to bring, you know, the issue forward.
[02:18:03.678 --> 02:18:08.320]  But, you know, we've got a problem, you know, with, you know, a lot of different things.
[02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:12.442]  And Mr. Trump is right when it comes to vetting who's coming into this country.
[02:18:12.982 --> 02:18:21.566]  So, you know, again, attacks that happened just the other day are going to continue to happen if, you know, if we don't do something about it.
[02:18:23.588 --> 02:18:26.289]  Well, Tim, other angles to this.
[02:18:26.889 --> 02:18:31.191]  Obviously, if folks are on the East Coast or in the Midwest, you know, they're gonna be pretty close to Cleveland.
[02:18:31.211 --> 02:18:32.052]  They need to be there.
[02:18:32.072 --> 02:18:34.653]  Obviously, a lot of folks are worried about housing and things.
[02:18:34.753 --> 02:18:39.696]  Even if you stay 20 miles away and, you know, drive in and are there just a few key events,
[02:18:40.475 --> 02:18:42.456]  You don't have to be there the whole three or four days.
[02:18:42.536 --> 02:18:55.081]  It's important just to show up, just to document, not even to wear a Trump shirt, but to videotape and get this footage out so people can see exactly the type of ignorant folks that are against the First Amendment.
[02:18:56.035 --> 02:19:06.401]  Yes, I mean, you know, again, if we don't show up there in the document, if we don't show up at least to give our free speech, you know, to stand up for our free speech, then, you know, we do ourself a disservice.
[02:19:06.481 --> 02:19:09.823]  I mean, if we're patriotic warriors, then we need to stand up for that.
[02:19:09.863 --> 02:19:15.327]  Because, again, you're right, you know, this could disappear on us pretty quick if we don't stand up for ourselves.
[02:19:15.387 --> 02:19:21.770]  And this is one of the reasons I joined on with the ACLU, and I thought that was an interesting fact that they wanted to sue the city.
[02:19:22.231 --> 02:19:23.992]  But, you know, again,
[02:19:24.512 --> 02:19:25.793]  We have to do something about it.
[02:19:25.853 --> 02:19:39.421]  If we don't, if we just lay down and we let the other agenda win, so to speak, the leftists, the Black Lives Matter people, and all the other groups that are trying to trend what America thinks, so to speak, then we've lost already.
[02:19:41.769 --> 02:19:42.971]  Timothy Saleti.
[02:19:43.011 --> 02:19:44.073]  Am I pronouncing that right, sir?
[02:19:44.714 --> 02:19:45.275]  Yeah, Saleti.
[02:19:45.755 --> 02:19:46.417]  Saleti, okay.
[02:19:46.837 --> 02:19:50.443]  And that's citizensfortrump.com, citizensfortrump.com.
[02:19:52.326 --> 02:19:56.272]  I want to ask you a question here at the break, and we may come back with you, but I've got one more question for you.
[02:20:00.219 --> 02:20:01.620]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:20:01.660 --> 02:20:02.740]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:20:03.001 --> 02:20:03.941]  Why is this show good?
[02:20:04.221 --> 02:20:09.444]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:20:09.544 --> 02:20:23.090]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:24.531]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:20:25.151 --> 02:20:25.471]  I think so.
[02:20:45.695 --> 02:20:47.876]  You have to disintegrate the lining.
[02:20:47.896 --> 02:20:52.898]  I mean, on viruses that protect themselves, and so do bacteria and protozoa and mycoplasms.
[02:20:53.298 --> 02:20:57.520]  They have a protective shell that a lot of times the immune system can't even get into.
[02:20:57.720 --> 02:20:58.761]  Our own immune system.
[02:20:59.321 --> 02:21:02.022]  Especially since most people's immune system are weak anyway.
[02:21:02.182 --> 02:21:04.746]  People can avoid toxic air if they want.
[02:21:04.766 --> 02:21:06.408]  They can get an air purification system.
[02:21:06.428 --> 02:21:12.596]  They can avoid toxic water and drink clean water, but it's really hard to avoid parasites.
[02:21:13.097 --> 02:21:17.363]  It's hard to avoid attacking organisms and that's where I see this going.
[02:21:17.403 --> 02:21:19.405]  I mean, I think a lot of the information that we
[02:21:20.006 --> 02:21:20.646]  We're good to go.
[02:21:41.559 --> 02:21:43.200]  So the Living Defense is amazing.
[02:21:43.420 --> 02:21:45.700]  We've seen just tremendous reviews.
[02:21:46.361 --> 02:21:48.501]  How often could you take Living Defense?
[02:21:48.521 --> 02:21:49.902]  I mean, is it a regimen every day?
[02:21:49.942 --> 02:21:51.783]  That's what I was doing until we ran out.
[02:21:52.103 --> 02:21:53.823]  Or do you do it heavier for certain cleanses?
[02:21:53.843 --> 02:21:54.684]  What do you do, Dr. Group?
[02:21:55.364 --> 02:22:06.908]  Well, I do usually six weeks at a time because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites, it's six weeks from the time... So you're going to kill the ones that are in there and then kill their babies when the eggs hatch out?
[02:22:07.248 --> 02:22:21.841]  If you're suffering from abdominal pain, allergies, even like headaches, anemia, weakened immune system, gut problems, depression, hair loss, excess gas, muscle pain, nervousness, I mean all these things.
[02:22:21.901 --> 02:22:28.968]  If you look at some of these conditions and then us opening up our borders and all the other countries opening up their borders.
[02:22:29.528 --> 02:22:39.976]  You're just dealing with a mass amount of parasites or harmful organisms or biological weapons that are spreading and mutating all across the world.
[02:22:39.996 --> 02:22:44.119]  And I think that's one of the reasons why, I mean, all you have to do is look at the news these days.
[02:22:44.699 --> 02:22:47.121]  You can type in refugees, spreading disease.
[02:22:47.181 --> 02:22:49.483]  I mean, the CDC is going crazy right now.
[02:22:50.083 --> 02:22:54.506]  There's a new antibiotic resistant E. coli that they just identified.
[02:22:54.626 --> 02:22:55.727]  Doctors don't know.
[02:22:55.807 --> 02:22:59.450]  They don't teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms.
[02:22:59.470 --> 02:23:01.592]  There's a reason why they don't teach them about that.
[02:23:01.692 --> 02:23:07.656]  Just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause of disease and how to eliminate all disease out there.
[02:23:07.716 --> 02:23:09.117]  They don't want you to know about it.
[02:23:09.377 --> 02:23:12.059]  You don't want your own immune system being attacked.
[02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:13.861]  Again, you know, you have animals
[02:23:14.281 --> 02:23:15.703]  Especially your cats, dogs.
[02:23:15.743 --> 02:23:17.604]  So many people have pets these days.
[02:23:18.065 --> 02:23:19.486]  People eat raw sushi.
[02:23:19.887 --> 02:23:21.528]  People eat more raw food.
[02:23:21.568 --> 02:23:25.773]  You have all these different organisms showing up in the water supplies now.
[02:23:26.273 --> 02:23:29.596]  You even have it in the air supplies, these tiny microorganisms.
[02:23:29.636 --> 02:23:32.459]  So it's not like we can get away from them.
[02:23:32.519 --> 02:23:34.001]  We just have to do everything.
[02:23:34.081 --> 02:23:35.562]  I recommend doing a parasite
[02:23:36.483 --> 02:23:37.663]  All right.
[02:23:38.124 --> 02:23:40.924]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:23:40.944 --> 02:23:41.985]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:23:42.025 --> 02:23:42.565]  Living Defense.
[02:23:42.865 --> 02:23:43.905]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:23:43.965 --> 02:23:45.006]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:23:45.286 --> 02:23:47.086]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:23:47.707 --> 02:23:49.587]  And you support the broadcast.
[02:23:49.647 --> 02:23:50.728]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:23:51.008 --> 02:23:52.888]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:23:53.268 --> 02:23:55.229]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:24:15.385 --> 02:24:16.526]  Tim Salati's our guest.
[02:24:16.566 --> 02:24:20.870]  He heads up citizensfortrump.com, also some of the biggest Tea Party sites in the country.
[02:24:22.072 --> 02:24:24.354]  And it was highly recommended from Roger Stone.
[02:24:24.394 --> 02:24:26.376]  He's heading up Citizens for Trump.
[02:24:27.037 --> 02:24:29.959]  And the lawsuits are taking place right now.
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:31.981]  We're fighting for the First Amendment.
[02:24:32.422 --> 02:24:35.485]  In closing, any other points and how do people out there support what you're doing?
[02:24:36.816 --> 02:24:37.477]  I appreciate it.
[02:24:37.497 --> 02:24:39.178]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:24:39.198 --> 02:24:40.019]  You bet.
[02:24:40.119 --> 02:24:45.283]  And they can come and support Mr. Trump in our efforts at CitizensForTrump.com.
[02:24:46.184 --> 02:24:47.305]  Go there, pledge your vote.
[02:24:47.505 --> 02:24:52.749]  We are going to hand deliver all the pledges for votes for Mr. Trump to him personally.
[02:24:52.809 --> 02:24:57.593]  So come there, pledge your vote, volunteer to help, and we'll get you started and get you involved.
[02:24:57.813 --> 02:24:59.595]  So at CitizensForTrump.com.
[02:25:00.290 --> 02:25:02.854]  Alright, well God bless you and I appreciate you standing up for the First Amendment.
[02:25:02.974 --> 02:25:03.695]  Tim, take care.
[02:25:04.136 --> 02:25:05.117]  And we appreciate you.
[02:25:05.157 --> 02:25:05.918]  Thank you so much.
[02:25:06.179 --> 02:25:07.380]  I appreciate you as well, Tim.
[02:25:07.741 --> 02:25:10.325]  Speaking of Tim, we have a Tim Kennedy video.
[02:25:10.445 --> 02:25:11.987]  We're at the end of the show yesterday.
[02:25:13.424 --> 02:25:22.429]  Special Forces soldier, UFC fighter, but the big thing is he's a patriot anti-New World Order and has great influence in the military and elsewhere for folks that aren't aware of what's happening.
[02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:28.833]  So that's why it's exciting to have him working with us as a correspondent on all these great reports you're about to start seeing in the next few weeks.
[02:25:29.153 --> 02:25:31.775]  And we've already got five or six of them in the can.
[02:25:31.795 --> 02:25:34.277]  He's shooting more this week and next week.
[02:25:35.473 --> 02:25:45.720]  But when we come back, I'm going to play this brief clip where he talks about this piece that they put on the news, where they're saying, oh my gosh, AR-15s, they kick so hard they hurt you.
[02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:46.921]  They're so evil.
[02:25:46.981 --> 02:25:48.062]  Oh my gosh, don't get one.
[02:25:48.082 --> 02:25:49.242]  I have PTSD from it.
[02:25:49.542 --> 02:25:51.404]  This is part of the anti-gun brainwashing.
[02:25:51.764 --> 02:25:52.845]  The opposite of what we do.
[02:25:54.417 --> 02:25:59.401]  Where we simply point out that you can go out and learn how to use a gun and that it's empowering.
[02:25:59.741 --> 02:26:03.244]  And that if you're, quote, a feminist, you should want women to be equalized.
[02:26:04.005 --> 02:26:13.113]  When women do get attacked by men, or if you're a man attacked by a stronger man or a bunch of men, that the gun is a great equalizer.
[02:26:14.144 --> 02:26:16.446]  That is the most liberal thing I can imagine.
[02:26:16.466 --> 02:26:24.230]  We talk about liberal, it means more freedom, more defense, more security, more private property, more choices, more literature, more culture, more art.
[02:26:24.651 --> 02:26:27.493]  The opposite of what modern orthodox Islam is.
[02:26:28.213 --> 02:26:34.017]  But they don't want us to defend ourselves, and they're blaming the Second Amendment all over the news, saying it's time to repeal the
[02:26:35.632 --> 02:26:36.213]  Second Amendment.
[02:26:36.773 --> 02:26:39.696]  That's all over newspapers from Rolling Stone to you name it today.
[02:26:40.177 --> 02:26:42.059]  It is mind-blowing.
[02:26:42.179 --> 02:26:43.120]  UCLA professor.
[02:26:43.741 --> 02:26:46.564]  Congress should secretly suspend Second Amendment.
[02:26:46.584 --> 02:26:47.945]  Has a whole plan for that.
[02:26:47.965 --> 02:26:52.650]  Technocrats just say start individually doing it.
[02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:53.931]  Put them on a no-buy list.
[02:26:53.991 --> 02:26:55.113]  No one will know we've banned it.
[02:26:55.673 --> 02:26:56.774]  These folks mean business.
[02:26:57.075 --> 02:26:57.835]  They mean business.
[02:26:58.922 --> 02:27:09.607]  Speaking of Tim Kennedy, we are going to finance being able to have all these productions and helicopters and drones and just amazing things we're going to do now with a shoestring budget.
[02:27:09.627 --> 02:27:10.407]  We can do some big things.
[02:27:10.428 --> 02:27:14.409]  We're financing that, selling products at Infowarslife.com, the nutraceuticals.
[02:27:14.770 --> 02:27:19.052]  And Tim Kennedy got the Anti-Doping Administration because he's known as being the cleanest guy in the UFC.
[02:27:19.972 --> 02:27:21.993]  All these guys that keep fighting are on roids.
[02:27:22.033 --> 02:27:22.714]  It keeps coming out.
[02:27:23.534 --> 02:27:34.541]  But as part of a partnership with special forces operator UFC fighter Tim Kennedy, we're giving you 15% off the top three selling InfoWars Life formulas that are used by Tim Kennedy.

[02:28:21.015 --> 02:28:23.338]  There's other great products there that are about to sell out.
[02:28:26.229 --> 02:28:40.078]  Like Living Defense Harmful Organism Cleansing System, 120 capsules of amazing concentrated known herbs and compounds that in a healthy, clean way go in and take out the bad organisms.
[02:28:40.158 --> 02:28:42.060]  It's got things like wormwood in it.
[02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:46.122]  Why is it called organic wormwood for thousands of years in ancient English?
[02:28:46.643 --> 02:28:50.085]  Because it's what's known itself to flush out the worms and parasites.
[02:28:50.345 --> 02:28:55.469]  That's one of 20-something plus ingredients in there that's sold out, ladies and gentlemen, for
[02:28:56.829 --> 02:29:07.155]  Six months, because it's so hard to get all these ingredients and have them be organic and have them be up to California standards, which are basically meant to be almost impossible to pass, so lawyers can sue everyone and make a bunch of money.
[02:29:07.695 --> 02:29:10.676]  But regardless, we, with all of our products, shoot for that.
[02:29:12.097 --> 02:29:21.622]  And we have one or two products that came in where we just cannot do it at that level, and so we're putting a note on there that it doesn't pass California standards and not selling it in California.
[02:29:22.628 --> 02:29:26.971]  That's not this one, that's Ancient Defense, because it's got like 60-something things in it.
[02:29:27.431 --> 02:29:32.574]  Just everything there is, and then just on one little level, there's something above California standards, so who won't sell it there?
[02:29:32.614 --> 02:29:38.017]  But, you know, that's just an example of how hellish this is, and why almost no companies have stuff to pass California standards.
[02:29:38.037 --> 02:29:39.818]  But it's back in for a limited time.
[02:29:40.199 --> 02:29:44.081]  I think it'll probably sell out this weekend, even though I put it back to the regular price.
[02:29:44.421 --> 02:29:47.923]  InfoWarsLive.com, your purchase makes everything we do here possible.
[02:29:48.123 --> 02:29:49.184]  Big news blitz coming up, stay with us.
[02:29:49.204 --> 02:29:49.844]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.325 --> 02:29:51.846]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.848 --> 02:29:55.541]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.654 --> 02:30:00.675]  BrainForce is here.
[02:30:01.195 --> 02:30:03.477]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:30:03.757 --> 02:30:11.602]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:30:12.363 --> 02:30:15.945]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:30:15.965 --> 02:30:18.307]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:30:18.667 --> 02:30:22.190]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:30:22.210 --> 02:30:25.352]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:30:25.832 --> 02:30:30.614]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:30:31.174 --> 02:30:33.015]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[02:30:33.355 --> 02:30:37.777]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:30:37.937 --> 02:30:39.958]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:30:40.578 --> 02:30:42.059]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:30:42.199 --> 02:30:42.439]  Exactly.
[02:30:42.479 --> 02:30:46.260]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:30:46.760 --> 02:30:54.023]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:30:54.303 --> 02:30:54.743]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[02:30:59.457 --> 02:31:12.004]  The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, as summarized by the Senate Armed Services Committee, proposes a 25% reduction in generals and admirals across the board, reports the Daily Caller.
[02:31:12.264 --> 02:31:21.009]  A summary of the bill provided by the committee states the drawdown in general officers also applies at the 3, 2, and 1 star levels.
[02:31:21.229 --> 02:31:32.320]  The committee reasons that over the past 30 years, the end strength of the joint force has decreased 38%, but the ratio of four-star officers to the overall force has increased by 65%.
[02:31:32.620 --> 02:31:42.469]  The bill's summary explains that by making heavy cuts at the three and four-star level, it can allow the services a broader base to develop future leaders.
[02:31:42.689 --> 02:31:46.333]  The summary also cites budget concerns as a reason for the reduction.
[02:31:46.573 --> 02:31:54.938]  Saying that the Pentagon must proactively work to shift as many personnel as possible from staff functions to operational and other vital roles.
[02:31:55.118 --> 02:31:59.001]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:59.421 --> 02:32:00.422]  Brain Force is here.
[02:32:00.962 --> 02:32:03.244]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:32:03.504 --> 02:32:11.329]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:32:12.099 --> 02:32:15.682]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:32:15.702 --> 02:32:18.043]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:32:18.403 --> 02:32:21.926]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:32:21.966 --> 02:32:25.108]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:32:25.609 --> 02:32:30.412]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:32:30.952 --> 02:32:32.774]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:32:33.134 --> 02:32:37.537]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:32:37.717 --> 02:32:39.718]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:32:40.339 --> 02:32:41.800]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:32:41.960 --> 02:32:42.200]  Exactly.
[02:32:42.220 --> 02:32:45.981]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.

[02:33:15.439 --> 02:33:17.100]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.260 --> 02:33:19.081]  Because there is a war on.
[02:33:19.241 --> 02:33:19.881]  Or your mind.
[02:33:19.941 --> 02:33:20.081]  So.
[02:33:20.281 --> 02:33:26.144]  I have talked a lot about how, back when I had time, I would take liberals, as painful as it is, out shooting.
[02:33:41.354 --> 02:33:56.181]  And my father, growing up, I remember he would take liberal friends of his that were newspaper editors and writers and people like that out to our East Texas ranch and they would be phobic of a shotgun and be all scared and act all neurotic and mentally ill.
[02:33:56.581 --> 02:33:58.842]  They would be completely scared of bugs.
[02:34:00.049 --> 02:34:01.612]  They would be completely scared of spiders.
[02:34:02.193 --> 02:34:05.459]  These are domesticated people that usually live lock and key.
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:07.543]  Daddy usually wasn't home.
[02:34:07.583 --> 02:34:08.885]  They're usually nice intellectuals.
[02:34:08.905 --> 02:34:11.370]  They're friendly people, but they're emasculated.
[02:34:13.263 --> 02:34:22.452]  And within about an hour of pulling out shotguns and rifles and, you know, shooting stuff, they would be laughing, saying, this is not scary, I don't know why I was ever so, you know, so afraid.
[02:34:22.473 --> 02:34:36.106]  And then my dad would say, well, you do need to know how to, you know, never put your finger on the trigger until you're ready to pull the trigger and, you know, keep it, you know, aimed at the ground and, you know, never, you know, go through the safety things with people and, you know, always unload the gun when you're going to transport it, on and on and on.
[02:34:36.943 --> 02:34:37.844]  Just basic stuff.
[02:34:38.224 --> 02:34:44.367]  And I've gone out with Mike Judge, and I've done this with the cast of Silicon Valley.
[02:34:44.427 --> 02:34:46.248]  I've done it with other folks.
[02:34:46.629 --> 02:34:53.393]  And when he's doing a movie or a TV show or a production, he takes them to Austin, usually for South by Southwest or other event, takes them out to his ranch.
[02:34:53.413 --> 02:34:54.573]  We even have some footage of that somewhere.
[02:34:54.593 --> 02:34:55.134]  We never aired it.
[02:34:55.974 --> 02:34:58.857]  And he takes leftists out.
[02:34:59.538 --> 02:35:01.019]  He doesn't say I'm deprogramming you.
[02:35:01.059 --> 02:35:02.400]  He just puts barbecue out and stuff.
[02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:05.643]  And he has some former military folks out there that know what they're doing.
[02:35:05.683 --> 02:35:09.907]  And we start getting women to shoot M4s, AR-15s.
[02:35:10.368 --> 02:35:12.089]  And they go, this is that evil gun on the news.
[02:35:12.130 --> 02:35:13.211]  We just go, go ahead and try it.
[02:35:13.231 --> 02:35:16.414]  And within an hour or so, the women are shooting bullseye at 100 to 200 yards.
[02:35:16.454 --> 02:35:19.496]  Because women, on average, are better shots than men.
[02:35:20.217 --> 02:35:23.900]  At the Olympic level, men a little bit more, because they think men train harder.
[02:35:23.940 --> 02:35:30.765]  But just as novices, you take a woman versus a man, same age, and in an hour of training, women tend to be better shots.
[02:35:30.865 --> 02:35:32.066]  It's just, it's a known fact.
[02:35:32.686 --> 02:35:34.828]  Unless they're just shooting some guy that has an incredible kick.
[02:35:36.389 --> 02:35:38.611]  And then they start going, well, I should be able to have a gun.
[02:35:39.271 --> 02:35:40.432]  I should be able to have this.
[02:35:40.532 --> 02:35:41.833]  I'm not bad, absolutely.
[02:35:41.953 --> 02:35:45.216]  Wow, so what type should I get for self-defense?
[02:35:45.896 --> 02:35:46.517]  And things like that.
[02:35:47.509 --> 02:35:48.671]  And I'm allowed to have one of these?
[02:35:48.711 --> 02:35:49.592]  I thought these were illegal.
[02:35:49.612 --> 02:35:54.318]  Because they have all these TV shows and movies where the cop pulls you over and it's based in New York, Chicago, or D.C.
[02:35:54.358 --> 02:35:56.160]  and they go, oh, you got a handgun.
[02:35:56.200 --> 02:35:57.342]  That's 20 years in prison.
[02:35:57.362 --> 02:36:00.245]  Because that will be some local state law they have.
[02:36:00.506 --> 02:36:01.267]  It's unconstitutional.
[02:36:02.267 --> 02:36:04.387]  So they don't even know that you're allowed to have guns.
[02:36:04.407 --> 02:36:13.809]  I mean, I remember just 15, 20 years ago, I had a carpet cleaner, that was about 16, 17 years ago, carpet cleaner crew at my house.
[02:36:14.529 --> 02:36:27.072]  And they went in my office and there was, and I didn't have kids then either, and there was a gun rack that had a black Winchester, I think it was a Defender, like $300 pump shotgun.
[02:36:27.412 --> 02:36:30.133]  There was a deer rifle under it, but it was black.
[02:36:31.153 --> 02:36:31.773]  It was black.
[02:36:33.829 --> 02:36:38.198]  And he's like, I can't clean in here!
[02:36:42.031 --> 02:36:44.452]  The assistant was the one that wasn't mentally ill.
[02:36:45.312 --> 02:36:47.952]  That actually worked for that steamer company a few years before.
[02:36:47.972 --> 02:36:49.713]  Because it paid pretty good, like $25 an hour.
[02:36:49.733 --> 02:36:51.873]  So you have the assistant and then the main person.
[02:36:52.113 --> 02:36:59.555]  But it was the main person, Stanley Steamer Carpet Cleaner, it was the main person that was freaking out going, I don't know, it's a gun, I don't know.
[02:36:59.915 --> 02:37:00.915]  And he goes, no, that's it.
[02:37:01.035 --> 02:37:05.296]  And so he goes outside and starts calling his bosses.
[02:37:05.876 --> 02:37:08.118]  So I call him and I go, yeah, let me give you the manager.
[02:37:08.158 --> 02:37:10.279]  And he goes, yeah, I'm on the other line with him right now.
[02:37:10.600 --> 02:37:11.721]  Hold on, such and such.
[02:37:12.261 --> 02:37:13.222]  Yes, we understand.
[02:37:13.662 --> 02:37:14.403]  Yes, we understand.
[02:37:14.563 --> 02:37:16.424]  No, he was going to call the police, but now he isn't.
[02:37:17.565 --> 02:37:18.706]  But we're just going to tell him to go.
[02:37:19.727 --> 02:37:29.174]  So they left my house because in Texas, in a little three bedroom blue collar house,
[02:37:31.715 --> 02:37:35.920]  Our upper blue collar, lower middle class, that's actually four bedroom, I had a bedroom upstairs.
[02:37:35.940 --> 02:37:43.147]  The point is, I tell these stories, I go back to the actual memories and start imaging and, you know, having a memory scan of exactly what went on.
[02:37:43.167 --> 02:37:46.111]  That's why I kind of bumble on stories sometimes, because it's really what happened.
[02:37:46.892 --> 02:37:49.574]  And, but I just stalled on it because there's so much info.
[02:37:51.276 --> 02:37:52.317]  And I walked out there.
[02:37:53.655 --> 02:37:55.137]  And I was like, is there loading up the thing?
[02:37:55.177 --> 02:37:57.559]  I said, man, I used to work here like four or five years ago.
[02:37:57.939 --> 02:38:00.382]  We go in houses all the time with guns and all sorts of stuff.
[02:38:00.782 --> 02:38:02.224]  Don't you go in houses with guns?
[02:38:03.485 --> 02:38:08.310]  And there was the Hispanic assistant and he's like, man, he's crazy.
[02:38:08.850 --> 02:38:09.411]  I don't know.
[02:38:09.591 --> 02:38:10.172]  It's weird.
[02:38:10.832 --> 02:38:11.253]  Yeah.
[02:38:11.333 --> 02:38:12.554]  No, I've only been working here a few weeks.
[02:38:12.654 --> 02:38:13.135]  It's weird.
[02:38:14.508 --> 02:38:34.520]  And then I went and told that story on Access Television the next night when I had my show, and the assistant called in and told the rest of the story how they had actually called the police, but the police had told him that a shotgun wasn't illegal and didn't come, and that when he said, this is wrong, they fired him.
[02:38:35.001 --> 02:38:36.902]  Not the guy that wouldn't clean my house!
[02:38:38.443 --> 02:38:41.705]  With one of the bedrooms turned into an office, where I broadcast out of,
[02:38:44.249 --> 02:38:45.149]  Not because of that.
[02:38:48.250 --> 02:38:54.552]  No, they fired the, quote, assistant because he sat there and said this is crazy.
[02:38:56.452 --> 02:38:59.133]  So, that's what we're dealing with in this country.
[02:38:59.293 --> 02:39:10.576]  And they are programming people, they are controlling people, they are absolutely creating undue phobias and psychological, almost agoraphobic
[02:39:12.406 --> 02:39:14.948]  Concern overseeing a fellow slave with a gun.
[02:39:15.348 --> 02:39:33.563]  And the essence of what I'm doing, and what Tim Kennedy's doing, and others are doing, whether it's gardening, or whether it's learning how to camp, or whether it's learning how to swim, a lot of folks don't know how to swim, or whether it's learning how to box, or grapple, or learning how to clean a gun, or learning how to work on your car, becoming somewhat self-sufficient.
[02:39:34.764 --> 02:39:37.446]  And we're not up here on some high horse claiming we have all the answers.
[02:39:37.967 --> 02:39:40.749]  Though Tim Kennedy is pretty much Superman across the board.
[02:39:42.276 --> 02:39:53.085]  We're just trying to make Americana and being human and being inventive and being adaptive and being involved fun again, and not just watching TV and being a zombie.
[02:39:53.325 --> 02:39:54.806]  That's why people are so unfulfilled.
[02:39:54.867 --> 02:40:07.217]  Every study shows people that are working hard, involved, doing lots of hobbies, in their communities, politically active, live longer, are happier, develop new mental connections and neurons in the brain.
[02:40:09.011 --> 02:40:11.013]  Humanity is turning into a bunch of jellyfish.
[02:40:11.833 --> 02:40:17.658]  And it's now time to realize we're going to fix the country and fix the world, fixing ourselves one person at a time.
[02:40:17.939 --> 02:40:19.640]  And again, I'm not up here on some high horse.
[02:40:20.140 --> 02:40:22.142]  I'm slowly becoming healthy again.
[02:40:22.502 --> 02:40:28.888]  Slowly becoming, you know, more inventive and more involved and getting back into guns because I'm so busy.
[02:40:28.908 --> 02:40:32.811]  I don't have a lot of time to go out and shoot guns or, you know, be proficient in that like I used to be.
[02:40:32.831 --> 02:40:36.054]  I mean, when I was 18, I could shoot to the same hole with a Remington .700, .308.
[02:40:37.635 --> 02:40:42.857]  Over and over again, with a $300 scope, not even that fancy, at 200 yards.
[02:40:43.818 --> 02:40:50.200]  And I'd be out at these quasi-police ranges where the cops are out shooting, and I was out shooting the SWAT teams, you name it.
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:57.263]  I was in some of the police contest deals where you could have quote civilians involved, but
[02:40:57.910 --> 02:41:02.694]  Forty percent, sixty percent, depending on the event, were police.
[02:41:02.794 --> 02:41:03.615]  Sometimes eighty percent.
[02:41:03.915 --> 02:41:15.305]  And they would get so upset when I'd go out there and go through those ranges with a pistol and things like that, or handgun, and be in the top ten percentile out of a hundred people competing.
[02:41:15.325 --> 02:41:16.366]  Well, that's not that good.
[02:41:17.066 --> 02:41:18.908]  But nowadays, I am horrible.
[02:41:19.388 --> 02:41:21.250]  I mean, two hundred yards?
[02:41:23.493 --> 02:41:28.017]  I got a pattern that's like, depending on the windage and things like that, you know, maybe two inches.
[02:41:28.037 --> 02:41:29.838]  I mean, that is just terrible.
[02:41:30.559 --> 02:41:33.121]  I go out and try to shoot some dove or quail, miss half the time.
[02:41:33.361 --> 02:41:42.028]  I go out to the clay shooting events and, you know, I might miss one out of five clay pigeons.
[02:41:42.689 --> 02:41:45.931]  When I was 18, I would go an hour without missing one.
[02:41:45.951 --> 02:41:46.992]  It was just sickening.
[02:41:47.393 --> 02:41:51.096]  So the point is, is that I'm going to get back into all that myself as well.
[02:41:51.837 --> 02:42:08.335]  Without further ado, though, let's go to this piece where Tim and I were talking about this yesterday, but we didn't have the video, so I thought I'd actually intersperse the video with little girls shooting .223s, shooting M4s or 5.56s, depending on whether you're talking about NATO or civilian.
[02:42:09.329 --> 02:42:11.071]  Without getting into all the little numbers games.
[02:42:11.791 --> 02:42:23.642]  Here's a video first of some little girls shooting the evil Bushmaster, the evil AR-15, the evil M4 that people claim is so dangerous and kicks so hard.
[02:42:23.882 --> 02:42:26.905]  Because the truth is they know it doesn't kick and it's perfect for women.
[02:42:27.105 --> 02:42:28.206]  It's perfect for everybody.
[02:42:28.386 --> 02:42:31.529]  So they can demonize that frontline number one weapon.
[02:42:31.769 --> 02:42:34.131]  Then they can demonize them all and bring them all down.
[02:42:34.471 --> 02:42:36.413]  Bring down all semi-autos and then later
[02:42:36.673 --> 02:42:38.774]  Get your bolt actions and single shots as well.
[02:42:39.215 --> 02:42:46.999]  And then we play this New York Daily News reporter acting about how freaked out he is after he went into a gun range and shot a gun.
[02:42:47.300 --> 02:42:50.521]  But they don't even really show that because who knows if they even did it.
[02:42:50.642 --> 02:42:51.082]  Here it is.
[02:42:54.544 --> 02:42:55.805]  Nice shot, Abby.
[02:42:56.665 --> 02:42:57.966]  Right to the right of the bullseye.
[02:42:58.006 --> 02:42:58.786]  Good shot, baby.
[02:42:59.627 --> 02:43:00.047]  You're hot.
[02:43:03.689 --> 02:43:04.470]  Finger off the trigger.
[02:43:05.410 --> 02:43:05.990]  How did that feel?
[02:43:06.290 --> 02:43:06.790]  Pretty good.
[02:43:07.051 --> 02:43:07.411]  Excellent.
[02:43:07.551 --> 02:43:08.451]  Okay, let's see it again.
[02:43:08.591 --> 02:43:09.631]  Good trigger discipline.
[02:43:12.292 --> 02:43:12.813]  Trigger off.
[02:43:28.044 --> 02:43:30.866]  Neutering of what it means to be a man.
[02:43:31.146 --> 02:43:41.971]  So this guy goes and shoots an M4 at the range, and he has this catastrophic, nearly traumatic event while he's trying to shoot an M4.
[02:43:42.211 --> 02:43:42.531]  It's 2-2-3.
[02:43:42.711 --> 02:43:45.593]  This is what I let my 10-year-old shoot.
[02:43:57.130 --> 02:43:59.371]  Video of a five-year-old versus six-year-old shooting.
[02:43:59.391 --> 02:44:00.731]  It's just a little bit bigger than a 20.
[02:44:00.811 --> 02:44:01.931]  There's no kick.
[02:44:02.071 --> 02:44:02.832]  No, no kick at all.
[02:44:02.852 --> 02:44:03.872]  Not if you push it in his shoulder.
[02:44:04.092 --> 02:44:04.972]  Nothing, nothing.
[02:44:05.192 --> 02:44:09.733]  So he shoots this gun a couple of times and he's like the concussion, the gases, the smell of it all.
[02:44:09.973 --> 02:44:10.914]  It was so overwhelming.
[02:44:11.214 --> 02:44:14.515]  I was, I was, I had post-traumatic stress for hours after it.
[02:44:14.555 --> 02:44:15.735]  He's trying to create a phobia.
[02:44:16.670 --> 02:44:17.450]  So people don't do it.
[02:44:17.831 --> 02:44:23.533]  I mean, I'm not the super soldier, but I sit there and fire a hundred rounds with a .50 cal handheld.
[02:44:23.953 --> 02:44:24.433]  Effortlessly.
[02:44:24.753 --> 02:44:26.594]  And then these guys can't shoot a .223.
[02:44:26.694 --> 02:44:34.077]  I don't know if they've been actually emasculated or if they're just trying to demonstrate to the world how weak Americans are.
[02:44:35.339 --> 02:44:36.520]  I mean, it seems like it's intentional.
[02:44:36.540 --> 02:44:37.480]  He's like, no, no, no, no.
[02:44:37.820 --> 02:44:41.202]  It's not cool to go and work hard and to go train and go shoot.
[02:44:41.502 --> 02:44:47.386]  It's better just to be the biggest sissy on the planet that can't even shoot a .223 because it hurts my shoulder.
[02:44:47.586 --> 02:44:50.868]  And the gases and seeing the brass fly out, it's just traumatizing.
[02:44:51.148 --> 02:44:51.928]  I can't take it.
[02:44:51.948 --> 02:44:56.331]  Well, that's like these social justice warriors that see the chalk on the ground and start freaking out and convulsing.
[02:44:57.191 --> 02:44:58.312]  But not everybody's like that.
[02:44:59.252 --> 02:45:03.955]  What should the country do about gun owners or gun buyers who shouldn't have the guns?
[02:45:05.253 --> 02:45:06.014]  Tough question.
[02:45:07.134 --> 02:45:10.577]  The sheer firepower of those kind of weapons is absolutely awesome.
[02:45:11.097 --> 02:45:14.140]  My ears are still ringing and we had serious sound protection.
[02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:21.025]  It's a very dangerous weapon in the wrong hands, as Frank said, and keeping it out of the wrong hands is the challenge.
[02:45:23.146 --> 02:45:30.952]  I mean, we have these incredibly domesticated morons in the New York Daily News just ninnying around and then it doesn't show him even shoot on the video.
[02:45:33.892 --> 02:45:34.793]  It's just crazy!
[02:45:34.933 --> 02:45:37.796]  Yeah, what about guns in the wrong hands of a tyrannical government?
[02:45:39.517 --> 02:45:40.078]  What about that?
[02:45:41.159 --> 02:45:56.212]  By the way, as I mentioned earlier, we are running a special, 15% off the Tim Kennedy special, on InfoWars live products like Brain Force, Super Mental Vitality, and of course Secret 12, Methylcobalamin, and Vitamin B12.
[02:45:56.673 --> 02:45:58.314]  And folks, you can look at the studies on Vitamin B12.
[02:45:59.699 --> 02:46:02.702]  Most people absorb almost none of it in their gut.
[02:46:03.343 --> 02:46:05.385]  If you do, it's three, four, five percent if you're lucky.
[02:46:05.806 --> 02:46:07.828]  Under the tongue, you can get a lot more.
[02:46:07.888 --> 02:46:20.841]  Still not as good as injectable, but what this is is the injectable level quality methylcobalamin that you put under your tongue with a dripper and then you absorb a lot more than you would just taking it in to your stomach.
[02:46:21.602 --> 02:46:28.548]  Now again, consult your physician before you take vitamin B12 organic under your tongue, because it's so dangerous.
[02:46:28.588 --> 02:46:40.218]  And before you go outside or breathe air, I'm just gonna, it does say that on the bottle, but this is the same stuff that you get from a doctor that costs you 50 bucks, because I've done it, that you inject into your, you know, fat.
[02:46:40.699 --> 02:46:42.601]  And it gives you a lot of energy and it's totally healthy.
[02:46:42.761 --> 02:46:44.662]  I've gone out and done it, just to test and see.
[02:46:45.003 --> 02:46:47.064]  And quite frankly, the injectable of methylcobalamin
[02:46:47.825 --> 02:46:49.946]  Has a better effect than this under the tongue.
[02:46:50.266 --> 02:46:53.026]  Taking pills, I don't even feel it, doesn't even do anything.
[02:46:54.447 --> 02:46:55.587]  Injecting it, whoa!
[02:46:56.387 --> 02:46:57.548]  You gotta get a prescription for that.
[02:46:57.568 --> 02:47:02.449]  And I hate needles, but I do inject vitamin B12 a few days a week when I have the prescription.
[02:47:03.029 --> 02:47:05.110]  But it's the methylgobalamin, the same stuff.
[02:47:05.350 --> 02:47:06.850]  It's like, this is sweet, does this have sugar in it?
[02:47:06.910 --> 02:47:07.070]  No.
[02:47:07.350 --> 02:47:08.471]  That's how vitamin B12 tastes.
[02:47:10.396 --> 02:47:12.698]  Most of the stuff they have at the store is synthetic.
[02:47:12.818 --> 02:47:14.800]  It doesn't even get absorbed, period.
[02:47:14.860 --> 02:47:17.342]  It's totally fake, but the government lets them sell it.
[02:47:17.362 --> 02:47:26.391]  This is true, organic, vegan-derived methylcobalamin with another type of E12 that makes it absorb.
[02:47:26.411 --> 02:47:30.234]  20% is the, forget how you pronounce it, acetophilcobalamin or whatever.
[02:47:30.254 --> 02:47:31.415]  The scientists have all explained it to me.
[02:47:31.795 --> 02:47:35.439]  All I know is I got a major, I don't give this to the kids in the afternoon or at night.
[02:47:36.172 --> 02:47:44.161]  You know, kids, they're in the winter or whatever, or want to be healthy every day, Secret 12, Secret 12, in the morning, in the morning, and it doesn't have caffeine or stimulants.
[02:47:45.923 --> 02:47:51.589]  The way my dad describes it is that it's, and he's a chemist, a retired doctor, is, and he used to develop drugs,
[02:47:53.204 --> 02:47:57.348]  Pharmaceutical companies, is that it's the precursor basically of everything.
[02:47:57.388 --> 02:48:01.272]  Vitamin B12, they think is like the precursor of everything else.
[02:48:01.352 --> 02:48:05.596]  You've got to have it to develop your hormones, to build, just everything.
[02:48:05.896 --> 02:48:11.101]  Then there's some other things that are precursors too, like water, oxygen, iodine.
[02:48:11.341 --> 02:48:13.283]  Iodine's the good halogen, all the others are bad.
[02:48:13.803 --> 02:48:18.147]  Your body will use the bad ones, the chlorine, the fluoride, the bromine, all the rest of it.
[02:48:19.028 --> 02:48:22.229]  Unless you have the good halogen, and that is, of course, Secret 12.
[02:48:23.609 --> 02:48:27.411]  That is, of course, the good halogen, X2, nasoniodine.
[02:48:27.631 --> 02:48:30.111]  You've got to have these in your body.
[02:48:30.131 --> 02:48:31.352]  You've absolutely got to have them.
[02:48:31.772 --> 02:48:32.732]  And just like we've got to have freedom.
[02:48:33.012 --> 02:48:38.614]  And when you buy them at m4warsandlife.com, you get the very best products that the absolute nutraceutical
[02:48:39.634 --> 02:48:42.076]  Supplement freaks come up with.
[02:48:42.456 --> 02:48:44.037]  I mean, the soup Nazis love us.
[02:48:44.497 --> 02:48:45.378]  Use the Seinfeld joke.
[02:48:45.398 --> 02:48:46.619]  I don't mean literal Nazis, folks.
[02:48:46.659 --> 02:48:49.480]  I mean, you know, the guy that makes the very best soup is totally neurotic about it.
[02:48:49.701 --> 02:48:50.701]  He's called a soup Nazi.
[02:48:51.041 --> 02:48:54.264]  And now you call somebody that, you know, makes the very best Italian food.
[02:48:54.284 --> 02:48:57.706]  You know, this place is like, you know, are Nazis about it being the best or whatever.
[02:48:58.086 --> 02:49:02.109]  That means totally obsessed, neurotic about the very best, highest, cleanest quality.
[02:49:02.989 --> 02:49:05.671]  It's not a good connotation for Nazis, but you know what I mean.
[02:49:05.991 --> 02:49:06.812]  The neurotic
[02:49:07.605 --> 02:49:11.668]  Third-party nutraceutical review sites just love us.
[02:49:11.688 --> 02:49:14.871]  They're like, why is this right-wing lunatic having the best stuff?
[02:49:16.132 --> 02:49:17.433]  Because we're not right-wing lunatics.
[02:49:17.613 --> 02:49:20.535]  We just want... We're against the geoengineering.
[02:49:20.835 --> 02:49:22.877]  We're against the leaking nuclear reactors.
[02:49:23.097 --> 02:49:24.198]  We're against the glyphosates.
[02:49:24.398 --> 02:49:25.339]  We're against the GMO.
[02:49:25.579 --> 02:49:26.480]  We've done the research.
[02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:29.662]  We know there's a lot of research that, quote, leftists have done that's real stuff.
[02:49:30.263 --> 02:49:34.226]  That's why we are confused that you're anti-gun when the statistics show you should be pro-gun.
[02:49:34.586 --> 02:49:36.768]  Or why you like Hillary when she's a fascist warmonger.
[02:49:37.461 --> 02:49:43.246]  Or, but again, those are pop liberals on the ground that are the super dumb social justice warriors.
[02:49:43.386 --> 02:49:54.315]  I know there's real liberals a la, you know, the 60s or 70s that had some good points and were against the wars and against discrimination and really were against racism.
[02:49:54.535 --> 02:50:02.241]  But all of that's been hijacked and Madison Avenue and Wall Street have taken control of it and turned it into political weapons to get us all of each other's throats.
[02:50:02.281 --> 02:50:02.942]  That's what I'm getting at.
[02:50:03.722 --> 02:50:04.443]  I'm not plugging here.
[02:50:04.743 --> 02:50:06.685]  I'm just going off into the generalities of
[02:50:07.941 --> 02:50:09.342]  It isn't about liberal or conservative.
[02:50:09.963 --> 02:50:11.585]  But people communicate with those terms.
[02:50:12.025 --> 02:50:25.298]  So yes, the modern liberal is a very anti-liberal, anti-free speech, anti-American weirdo group, who I see as very threatening and bizarre, and who don't even care about their own interests and are allied with orthodox, which we call radical Islam.
[02:50:29.358 --> 02:50:35.839]  All I'm saying is, I don't go to an art opening so I feel like I'm an intellectual to sit around and listen to myself talk to other trendies.
[02:50:36.279 --> 02:50:39.460]  I go to an art opening if I like who the artist is because I want to buy some of the art.
[02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:47.521]  See, I don't, I don't like culture and theater and things like that because I'm trying to act like I'm cultured.
[02:50:47.961 --> 02:50:49.442]  I'm a barbarian goblin.
[02:50:50.042 --> 02:50:53.902]  But I also love culture and art because I've got those areas in my life.
[02:50:54.402 --> 02:50:55.363]  I'm multifaceted.
[02:50:55.483 --> 02:50:57.703]  I'm not a stereotype and neither should you be.
[02:50:59.742 --> 02:51:02.684]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[02:52:10.462 --> 02:52:14.067]  I don't know.
[02:52:47.071 --> 02:52:51.309]  If I was just gonna, like, attach an idea to it, it's gonna be dangerous freedom.
[02:53:00.197 --> 02:53:09.222]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:53:09.302 --> 02:53:17.526]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:53:17.706 --> 02:53:22.369]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:53:29.355 --> 02:53:36.441]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:53:36.541 --> 02:53:43.426]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:53:43.566 --> 02:53:47.910]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:53:48.030 --> 02:53:51.293]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[02:53:57.720 --> 02:53:59.422]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:54:21.008 --> 02:54:22.689]  I am a Midwest farmer.
[02:54:22.709 --> 02:54:25.010]  I make a living off the land.
[02:54:25.850 --> 02:54:27.771]  I ride a John Deere tractor.
[02:54:27.971 --> 02:54:29.432]  I'm a liberated man.
[02:54:30.452 --> 02:54:32.213]  The rain, it hasn't fallen.
[02:54:32.393 --> 02:54:35.674]  See, Willie Nelson loves me, boy, when I used to bash Bush.
[02:54:37.035 --> 02:54:42.937]  The bankman says he loves me.
[02:54:42.957 --> 02:54:43.958]  He'd have disliked me now.
[02:54:46.739 --> 02:54:49.020]  But that's an example of how perspectives work.
[02:54:49.997 --> 02:54:57.939]  I was against Bush because of warrantless surveillance and invading the wrong country and covering up 9-11 and being for the assault weapons ban.
[02:55:01.359 --> 02:55:02.899]  And I criticized him for all that.
[02:55:02.980 --> 02:55:15.582]  And liberals, whether it was Martin Sheen or whether it was Willie Nelson, they didn't care as long as I was bashing Bush.
[02:55:18.717 --> 02:55:21.943]  And I'd sit there, and I'd have dinner with them, and I'd say, I'm not a liberal.
[02:55:21.963 --> 02:55:23.425]  And they go, well, I know, I'm not either.
[02:55:23.746 --> 02:55:26.631]  I like organic milk, and I think vaccines are bad, and GMO's bad.
[02:55:27.563 --> 02:55:32.866]  We go out and go shooting out there, but then as soon as Obama comes in, it's like, why are you being so mean to Obama?
[02:55:33.386 --> 02:55:35.727]  I'm like, well, meet the new boss, same as the old boss, you know?
[02:55:36.188 --> 02:55:40.970]  But because he's, quote, a liberal, and because he's, quote, black, he gets all this political cover.
[02:55:41.050 --> 02:55:41.771]  We're in deep trouble.
[02:55:42.091 --> 02:55:50.095]  And now, finally, even the head of the Green Party's come out and said that, wow, Obama was worse than Bush, and so is Jonathan Turley and everybody else, because it's beyond that.
[02:55:50.155 --> 02:55:52.857]  These are just front people to get their agenda through.
[02:55:53.826 --> 02:56:07.078]  And so, if Donald Trump gets in and starts doing a bunch of bad stuff and doesn't, look, if he isn't just out to get the country and turns the economy on and doesn't screw people over, if he doesn't get a whole bunch of stuff done other than that, I'll be happy.
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:10.662]  I don't even expect purity or something to be perfect.
[02:56:10.762 --> 02:56:15.346]  I just don't want foaming at the mouth globalists that are completely out to get us on every front.
[02:56:15.646 --> 02:56:16.387]  That's what I'm getting at.
[02:56:19.039 --> 02:56:25.444]  Now before I go any further here, this is a big deal and I'm going to shoot a special report about this for the Nightly News tonight.
[02:56:25.484 --> 02:56:35.532]  I'm also going to shoot one for the show tomorrow because I didn't get to this enough, but I'm going to... I want to tailor this because this needs a lot of added research and data.
[02:56:37.013 --> 02:56:41.677]  Hacker releases secret Clinton docs from the State Department, DNC, Trump, opposition file, donor list.
[02:56:42.097 --> 02:56:44.059]  This is very interesting to see who's doing what.
[02:56:45.569 --> 02:56:46.769]  Very, very powerful info.
[02:56:47.470 --> 02:56:54.311]  We're also going to be getting into more of the wonders of Islam as the Taliban uses honey trap boys to kill Afghan police.
[02:56:54.811 --> 02:57:02.934]  When I talk about homosexuality being the highest in Islam, and pedophilia for that matter, I see comments going, Jones is crazy.
[02:57:03.834 --> 02:57:04.634]  They kill gays.
[02:57:05.014 --> 02:57:06.274]  No, I'm not the one that's crazy.
[02:57:06.334 --> 02:57:06.675]  They are.
[02:57:07.195 --> 02:57:08.055]  They're the ones
[02:57:09.431 --> 02:57:14.236]  I had the former head of the State Department Psych Warfare on that got the Camp David Accords on saying this yesterday, okay?
[02:57:14.256 --> 02:57:15.357]  I already knew this.
[02:57:15.417 --> 02:57:16.017]  Everybody knows this.
[02:57:16.097 --> 02:57:16.678]  It's researched.
[02:57:16.958 --> 02:57:20.001]  But the public is so ignorant they think I'm just talking Martian here.
[02:57:20.842 --> 02:57:21.483]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:57:22.384 --> 02:57:25.126]  Homosexuality is off the charts in Islam.
[02:57:25.286 --> 02:57:25.747]  Look it up.
[02:57:26.187 --> 02:57:27.829]  Pedophilia is basically legal.
[02:57:30.874 --> 02:57:38.880]  But then if the Imams or others in the Islamic group want to say that you are involved in homosexuality from a biblical perspective, then they can kill you.
[02:57:39.140 --> 02:57:40.741]  It's have your cake, eat it too.
[02:57:41.762 --> 02:57:42.062]  Okay?
[02:57:43.023 --> 02:57:45.505]  And that's what's going on and it's a freak show.
[02:57:46.766 --> 02:57:51.689]  And as I said a thousand times, I'm not sitting here taking the blame for these mass shootings that jihadists are doing.
[02:57:52.230 --> 02:57:54.912]  I don't care what Hillary and Obama and everybody else sits there and does.
[02:57:54.952 --> 02:57:55.652]  It's just not happening.
[02:57:55.772 --> 02:57:56.093]  I'm done.
[02:57:57.059 --> 02:57:59.701]  Just like political correctness, I do not dislike people for what color they are.
[02:58:00.401 --> 02:58:03.204]  I dislike people for how they act and how they behave, including myself sometimes.
[02:58:04.044 --> 02:58:05.866]  But I'm just done.
[02:58:05.886 --> 02:58:10.089]  I'm 42 years old and I was not brought up to be racist or hate anybody.
[02:58:10.129 --> 02:58:13.291]  In fact, I was brought up to put up with too much crap.
[02:58:14.772 --> 02:58:15.353]  And I'm not doing it.
[02:58:16.253 --> 02:58:18.275]  And just everybody else out there,
[02:58:19.694 --> 02:58:24.318]  I suggest you just reject political correctness even more, and I think that's what Donald Trump is a manifestation of.
[02:58:24.638 --> 02:58:25.719]  So I salute Donald Trump.
[02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:29.703]  Leanne McAdoo is doing the nightly news this evening, I'm told.
[02:58:29.723 --> 02:58:37.169]  And coming up in the next hour, we're going to have one of our other anchors coming in, but I'm going to do five more minutes.
[02:58:37.469 --> 02:58:38.450]  Some stations don't carry it.
[02:58:38.510 --> 02:58:40.332]  Infowars.com for its last show.
[02:58:40.672 --> 02:58:44.235]  Don't forget, we got the 15% off Tim Kennedy special at Infowars.com.
[02:58:49.557 --> 02:58:54.121]  A British Member of Parliament has just been shot with a handgun and stabbed to death with a knife.
[02:58:54.401 --> 02:58:59.325]  The killer got a job six years ago working in a park after being referred by a mental health clinic.
[02:58:59.525 --> 02:59:04.709]  He said working in the park was, quote, better than all the psychotherapy and medication in the world.
[02:59:04.969 --> 02:59:10.514]  This happens exactly one week before the Brexit vote, the referendum on whether Britain will leave the European Union.
[02:59:10.754 --> 02:59:20.005]  A fear campaign by Prime Minister Cameron and others has tried without success to scare people about economic recrimination by the bankers and the European elite if they leave.
[02:59:20.385 --> 02:59:30.497]  Now with polls showing leave with a clear majority and remain supporters largely apathetic, the shooting has quickly been politicized by the media and the ruling elite to create fear of British nationalism.
[02:59:30.837 --> 02:59:32.598]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:09.005 --> 03:00:09.966]  You want answers?
[03:00:10.026 --> 03:00:11.487]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:12.128 --> 03:00:13.929]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.944 --> 03:00:35.726]  Democrats end gun control filibuster for 15 hours.
[03:00:35.746 --> 03:00:37.187]  You got that going on.
[03:00:37.227 --> 03:00:37.387]  Why?
[03:00:37.427 --> 03:00:38.688]  It's time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[03:00:38.968 --> 03:00:39.489]  Rolling Stone.
[03:00:39.529 --> 03:00:43.091]  I got like a hundred articles I haven't covered, but I just can't get over them openly calling to repeal it.
[03:00:43.111 --> 03:00:44.652]  I mean, they keep promising they don't want our guns.
[03:00:45.052 --> 03:00:46.433]  Drudge the DHS Secretary.
[03:00:46.473 --> 03:00:47.494]  Give up your guns first.
[03:00:47.834 --> 03:00:48.995]  You go first, brah.
[03:00:49.015 --> 03:00:51.237]  FBI, U.S.
[03:00:51.597 --> 03:00:53.478]  homicide rate at 50-year low.
[03:00:53.678 --> 03:00:54.419]  Yep, that's true.
[03:00:55.319 --> 03:01:00.383]  Homicide rate's at a 50-year low, but believe me, people all over the country when their kids are swimming,
[03:01:01.397 --> 03:01:06.161]  Are looking for alligators right now because it's rare, it's scary, and it gets your instincts, you see.
[03:01:06.601 --> 03:01:10.204]  And having somebody come and shoot you, having a human come kill you, that's in our instincts too.
[03:01:10.585 --> 03:01:11.145]  We're afraid of it.
[03:01:13.187 --> 03:01:22.535]  That's why you can have like a cat in your house and have one of those fake plastic snakes and throw it down and that cat will jump three feet in the air and get back in an attack position.
[03:01:25.794 --> 03:01:28.055]  Your cat may have never seen a snake its whole life.
[03:01:28.615 --> 03:01:37.318]  It's got instinct, and they're just punching our buttons all day long, and so am I. I'm coming in here with my own instincts that we're being overrun with tyranny.
[03:01:37.759 --> 03:01:42.140]  We're seeing all sorts of evil be shut up, and I am here ringing the alarm saying, you ought to be scared of tyranny.
[03:01:42.841 --> 03:01:48.963]  Democide in the last hundred years killed over 200 million people, and that's death by government.
[03:01:50.063 --> 03:01:51.245]  That's non-military deaths.
[03:01:51.886 --> 03:01:55.192]  Two hundred, what is it, 262 million?
[03:01:55.512 --> 03:01:59.319]  That number's like a decade old University of Hawaii in Honolulu.
[03:02:03.899 --> 03:02:07.400]  But I tell you, I'm also going to have a message to Donald Trump today.
[03:02:07.880 --> 03:02:12.701]  Donald Trump to talk with NRA about denying Second Amendment to people on terror watch list.
[03:02:12.801 --> 03:02:15.901]  And you read his tweet, I don't know exactly what to make of it.
[03:02:15.921 --> 03:02:18.582]  Because he sounds like he's going to talk to them about doing that.
[03:02:19.102 --> 03:02:21.343]  And that just denies due process and is very, very dangerous.
[03:02:21.383 --> 03:02:27.784]  So, this will be the first time I've got a real issue with Donald Trump other than him not understanding or not getting or not...
[03:02:28.976 --> 03:02:31.957]  Fully comprehending or maybe being wrong on the whole Apple thing.
[03:02:31.997 --> 03:02:33.157]  Hey, give the FBI the code.
[03:02:33.177 --> 03:02:33.857]  They've got a warrant.
[03:02:33.897 --> 03:02:34.498]  Yeah, I get it.
[03:02:35.618 --> 03:02:36.238]  Give them the code.
[03:02:36.258 --> 03:02:38.179]  They've got a warrant to the San Bernardino shooter.
[03:02:38.219 --> 03:02:39.039]  That makes sense, doesn't it?
[03:02:39.739 --> 03:02:41.320]  Except there isn't one code.
[03:02:41.780 --> 03:02:43.520]  It's the keys to everybody's iPhone.
[03:02:44.681 --> 03:02:45.741]  And they could get through it.
[03:02:46.221 --> 03:02:48.082]  They don't need to say they're getting through that encryption.
[03:02:48.122 --> 03:02:52.763]  You get through it with the wire that goes in, and you can get into that in a few minutes with any good hacker.
[03:02:53.968 --> 03:02:55.428]  You know, the plug-in to give it power.
[03:02:55.468 --> 03:02:57.409]  That's an electronic interface with the phone.
[03:02:57.869 --> 03:02:58.829]  And you've got all the apps.
[03:02:58.909 --> 03:03:00.550]  Most of them have Trojan horses built in.
[03:03:00.570 --> 03:03:02.351]  You just call the company's administrators.
[03:03:02.371 --> 03:03:02.891]  They'll give it to you.
[03:03:02.911 --> 03:03:03.911]  And the FBI has all that.
[03:03:04.131 --> 03:03:04.991]  It was all red herring.
[03:03:05.031 --> 03:03:05.652]  It was all bull.
[03:03:06.952 --> 03:03:08.632]  But do I throw Donald Trump out because of that?
[03:03:08.732 --> 03:03:08.933]  No.
[03:03:09.473 --> 03:03:10.753]  He's killing political correctness.
[03:03:10.773 --> 03:03:11.973]  He's going up against globalism.
[03:03:12.274 --> 03:03:15.795]  He's exposing that our government's been funding ISIS.
[03:03:15.815 --> 03:03:18.756]  He's exposing the crooked corruption of the Democratic and Republican parties.
[03:03:19.316 --> 03:03:21.476]  He has not been taking political money up until now.
[03:03:21.496 --> 03:03:22.357]  Now he's in the general election.
[03:03:22.377 --> 03:03:23.157]  He pretty much has to.
[03:03:24.298 --> 03:03:25.900]  Like saying, well, oxygen is corrupt.
[03:03:25.960 --> 03:03:27.441]  Well, when you're in space, you need it.
[03:03:27.461 --> 03:03:31.104]  Well, who's going to get the oxygen from corrupt people?
[03:03:31.165 --> 03:03:32.306]  Well, they're the ones that got the money.
[03:03:33.647 --> 03:03:35.809]  Again, still, trust but verify.
[03:03:35.829 --> 03:03:38.431]  We've got to stay very close to the situation and watch it.
[03:03:38.451 --> 03:03:40.133]  But I'm going to be going over all of that today.
[03:03:40.573 --> 03:03:43.076]  And I'm also going to file a report on this because I didn't get to this properly.
[03:03:43.296 --> 03:03:45.238]  You know, Rob do really should because this is a big deal.
[03:03:46.719 --> 03:03:47.840]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[03:03:49.665 --> 03:04:10.692]  On Tuesday, June 14th, NATO announced that if a NATO member country becomes the victim of a cyber attack by persons in the non-NATO countries, such as Russia or China, the NATO's Article 5 collective defense provision requires each NATO member country to join that NATO member country if it decides to strike back against the attacking country.
[03:04:14.329 --> 03:04:28.355]  Paramilitary decision for this was made two years ago after Crimea abandoned Ukraine and rejoined Russia, of which has been part of unilaterally involved transformation to Ukraine by the Soviet dictator Nikita Khrushchev in 1954.
[03:04:28.975 --> 03:04:35.158]  The NATO decision was made in anticipation of Ukraine's ultimately becoming a NATO member country, which still hasn't happened.
[03:04:35.198 --> 03:04:39.100]  However, only now is NATO declaring cyber war itself to be
[03:04:40.080 --> 03:04:44.384]  ...included as a real war under the NATO Treaty Collective Defense Provision.
[03:04:44.904 --> 03:04:47.967]  And they go on to say that they militarily strike countries that are involved in that.
[03:04:48.327 --> 03:04:49.528]  Folks, can you imagine?
[03:04:49.869 --> 03:04:51.030]  A, you can't prove who did it.
[03:04:51.070 --> 03:04:52.211]  It's perfect for frame-ups.
[03:04:55.533 --> 03:04:57.535]  And then B, it starts a wider war when you do it.
[03:04:57.575 --> 03:04:58.176]  It's just crazy.
[03:05:00.074 --> 03:05:11.276]  Everyone, Obama and Trump, as well as the NRA and LGBT lobbyists, are saying the Orlando shooting requires new gun control measures because it's now an issue of national security.
[03:05:11.496 --> 03:05:14.597]  Democrats in Congress just ended a 15-hour filibuster.
[03:05:14.777 --> 03:05:20.798]  Republicans have caved and said they will hold a vote on whether to block people who have just been labeled a terrorist.
[03:05:20.978 --> 03:05:23.959]  Remember, this is secretly and without trial.
[03:05:24.199 --> 03:05:29.940]  People are put on terror watch lists and no-fly watch lists, without their knowledge, without being told of the charges
[03:05:29.940 --> 03:05:30.320]  I'm David Knight.
[03:06:01.192 --> 03:06:07.517]  I got so busy fighting the globalists for 15 years, I turned into a giant fat slob when I was an exercise fanatic before.
[03:06:07.937 --> 03:06:11.039]  Now in the last five years, I set out to try to get back in shape.
[03:06:11.460 --> 03:06:23.309]  And to help turbocharge that, I talked to top scientists and nutraceutical developers and said, I want something that blocks these estrogen mimickers, something that helps me get back to what a real male was like instead of this globalist bombardment.
[03:06:23.789 --> 03:06:26.670]  And we developed Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[03:06:26.850 --> 03:06:27.690]  They're best sellers.
[03:06:27.910 --> 03:06:29.251]  They're loved across the industry.
[03:06:29.411 --> 03:06:30.011]  They're amazing.
[03:06:30.271 --> 03:06:34.673]  You owe it to yourself to get a bottle of Super Male Vitality today at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:06:35.053 --> 03:06:38.114]  Folks, it's so amazing what Mother Nature gave us.
[03:06:38.394 --> 03:06:41.595]  You're crazy if you don't at least try a bottle of this, because you can't lose.
[03:06:41.835 --> 03:06:50.318]  You're fighting the InfoWare and the fight for freedom worldwide, while at the same time getting a game-changing supplement at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:06:50.458 --> 03:06:52.679]  Super Metal Vitality is now back in stock.
[03:06:52.899 --> 03:06:54.440]  It's been sold out for several months.
[03:06:54.660 --> 03:06:59.643]  That's available at m4warstore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:06:59.823 --> 03:07:05.366]  Everyone, Obama and Trump, as well as the NRA and LGBT lobbyists,
[03:07:05.566 --> 03:07:11.389]  ...are saying the Orlando shooting requires new gun control measures because it's now an issue of national security.
[03:07:11.609 --> 03:07:14.691]  Democrats in Congress just ended a 15-hour filibuster.
[03:07:14.871 --> 03:07:20.894]  Republicans have caved and said they will hold a vote on whether to block people who have just been labeled a terrorist.
[03:07:21.074 --> 03:07:24.056]  Remember, this is secretly and without trial.
[03:07:24.316 --> 03:07:30.739]  People are put on terror watch lists and no-fly watch lists without their knowledge, without being told of the charges against them,
[03:07:30.919 --> 03:07:35.342]  ...without being able to confront their accusers in an open trial by jury.
[03:07:35.502 --> 03:07:38.884]  Now we're going to apply punishments and sanctions against them.
[03:07:39.104 --> 03:07:43.067]  This is a star chamber process that the Bill of Rights was written to stop.
[03:07:43.287 --> 03:07:45.888]  Terror attacks are not a gun control issue.
[03:07:45.949 --> 03:07:47.670]  They're a border control issue.
[03:07:47.830 --> 03:07:52.933]  Without background checks for migrants, terrorists are free to use nuclear, biological or chemical weapons.
[03:07:53.233 --> 03:07:56.975]  A rifle may be your only defense against that kind of weapon.
[03:07:57.196 --> 03:07:59.137]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:08:09.068 --> 03:08:14.211]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:14.271 --> 03:08:18.614]  Welcome to the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:08:18.634 --> 03:08:24.358]  I'm your host, Rob Dew, from the Situation Room in the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:08:33.383 --> 03:08:34.484]  We are live right now.
[03:08:34.544 --> 03:08:40.027]  If you're not getting the fourth hour at your radio station or television station even, call them up.
[03:08:40.067 --> 03:08:41.387]  Tell them, hey, carry that fourth hour.
[03:08:41.968 --> 03:08:45.750]  Because we always go over more news, more phone calls.
[03:08:46.310 --> 03:08:47.631]  We're trying to make the fourth hour great again.
[03:08:48.581 --> 03:08:49.542]  I've got a lot of gun news.
[03:08:49.582 --> 03:08:57.009]  We've even got some exclusive news from a Don Salazar out of Houston as a result of this gay nightclub shooting.
[03:08:57.029 --> 03:09:02.975]  We're going to get into a little bit about a professor who traveled the world and says socialism doesn't work.
[03:09:03.015 --> 03:09:06.198]  And usually you see professors preaching socialism.
[03:09:07.392 --> 03:09:13.582]  And also calls, it looks like there's a Craigslist ad for a threat of an Orlando-style massacre in San Diego.
[03:09:13.622 --> 03:09:17.748]  But first, I want to get to, and I'm going to have David Knight come in at the bottom of the hour.
[03:09:17.788 --> 03:09:18.509]  We're going to talk about
[03:09:19.403 --> 03:09:28.889]  The concept of what would Jesus do at the gay bar shooting, because there's lots of calls from both sides of the religious spectrum, Islam and even the hard, I guess, evangelical right.
[03:09:29.290 --> 03:09:35.914]  I'm not even sure if that's the correct term for it, but how they've come out and kind of attacked or, I guess, celebrated what's going on.
[03:09:35.934 --> 03:09:47.002]  We're going to talk about why that's not needed and why reaching out to people with an open hand is always going to yield you better results than trying to be abrasive and confrontational.
[03:09:47.022 --> 03:09:47.522]  But here we go.
[03:09:47.902 --> 03:09:48.443]  Here's the first
[03:09:48.883 --> 03:09:50.564]  Tweet I want to read from Stefan Molyneux.
[03:09:50.944 --> 03:09:56.486]  If you are for gun control, then you are not against guns because the guns will be needed to disarm people.
[03:09:56.926 --> 03:09:58.166]  So it's not that you're anti-gun.
[03:09:58.566 --> 03:10:01.647]  You'll need the police's guns to take away other people's guns.
[03:10:01.848 --> 03:10:03.128]  So you're very pro-gun.
[03:10:03.808 --> 03:10:10.070]  You just believe that only the government, which is of course so reliable and honest, moral and virtuous, should be allowed to have guns.
[03:10:10.270 --> 03:10:11.931]  There is no such thing as gun control.
[03:10:12.191 --> 03:10:17.053]  There is only centralizing gun ownership in the hands of a small political elite and their minions.
[03:10:18.033 --> 03:10:19.435]  Right on the dot, right there.
[03:10:19.595 --> 03:10:21.317]  Right on the dot, he's got it.
[03:10:21.437 --> 03:10:24.240]  He understands where this argument comes from.
[03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:29.525]  And while the left can't understand that, there's always going to be one side with guns.
[03:10:30.526 --> 03:10:38.255]  And even when the government, which has been caught shipping guns to Mexico, criminals are always going to be getting guns.
[03:10:38.475 --> 03:10:39.095]  Look at Chicago.
[03:10:39.912 --> 03:10:42.094]  Most gun control laws, highest gun murder rate.
[03:10:42.735 --> 03:10:44.276]  And here's the next one I tweeted out.
[03:10:44.296 --> 03:10:46.578]  This is from Heavy Metal Patriot.
[03:10:47.039 --> 03:10:51.863]  Legal gun owners have over 200 million guns and 12 trillion rounds of ammo.
[03:10:52.143 --> 03:10:56.707]  I misspoke yesterday when I brought that up talking to Alex as we went into the fourth hour.
[03:10:57.048 --> 03:10:59.690]  Seriously, people, if we were a problem, you would know it.
[03:11:00.030 --> 03:11:00.551]  That's right.
[03:11:01.892 --> 03:11:04.373]  Honest, real gun owners aren't going to go out and shoot people.
[03:11:04.433 --> 03:11:05.713]  They're going to protect themselves.
[03:11:06.153 --> 03:11:07.453]  They're going to teach their kids how to shoot.
[03:11:07.473 --> 03:11:08.254]  They're going to go hunting.
[03:11:08.614 --> 03:11:13.095]  But mainly, it's there for self-defense and against a tyrannical government.
[03:11:13.175 --> 03:11:18.496]  Which is why we have, it's not perfect people, but it's the best system in the world.
[03:11:18.516 --> 03:11:22.437]  And that's why you have people building rafts out of garbage to get here.
[03:11:22.457 --> 03:11:26.138]  And they're doing the same thing getting to Europe because where they're coming from is even worse.
[03:11:26.798 --> 03:11:29.560]  So, let's go to this article.
[03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:32.261]  This is Don Salazar and this is exclusive to InfoWars.
[03:11:33.362 --> 03:11:38.105]  Gun range selling out free concealed handgun courses for LGBT.
[03:11:38.525 --> 03:11:41.306]  Company has opened several classes since announcing the offer.
[03:11:41.326 --> 03:11:44.568]  And this is the owners of the Shiloh Gun Range on the outskirts of Houston.
[03:11:44.929 --> 03:11:52.713]  We've got our reporters going there tomorrow after they hit this Dallas Trump rally to go interview the owners of the Shiloh Gun Range.
[03:11:52.733 --> 03:11:53.914]  So we're going to make that happen.
[03:11:54.614 --> 03:11:59.517]  And due to the overwhelming demand at Shiloh's shooting, we'll be offering additional classes.
[03:11:59.878 --> 03:12:07.703]  Please call us, they said in a recent Facebook post, as we can't access our voicemail due to the volume of calls and our email server has crashed due to the number of emails.
[03:12:08.383 --> 03:12:11.585]  We've been inundated with phone calls ever since the news went out.
[03:12:12.166 --> 03:12:21.492]  And Shiloh manager Jeff Sanford says, this offer not stems from a marketing standpoint, but from the desire to rally more people behind the Second Amendment.
[03:12:21.992 --> 03:12:23.333]  Okay, I'm going to read that one more time.
[03:12:23.634 --> 03:12:25.856]  To rally more people behind the Second Amendment.
[03:12:26.276 --> 03:12:31.240]  If you care about the Second Amendment, you should be celebrating this and should be telling other people in your area about it.
[03:12:31.260 --> 03:12:39.188]  This is an effort to reach out to a very small but vocal and passionate community that can be positive advocates of the Second Amendment for us.
[03:12:39.768 --> 03:12:44.572]  And if people don't agree with that, then they're absolutely wrong and they're not an advocate that they think they are.
[03:12:45.333 --> 03:12:48.797]  So he's saying reach out with an open hand instead of a closed fist.
[03:12:49.237 --> 03:12:53.842]  And that's what we have to do because what they're doing now is all a part of divide and conquer.
[03:12:53.862 --> 03:12:55.964]  It's to get Americans fighting with each other.
[03:12:56.304 --> 03:13:01.109]  And the reason we have this country is so people of all walks of life can come together and build a society.
[03:13:01.169 --> 03:13:05.733]  We may not agree with everything that each other does and that is our right to not agree with it.
[03:13:06.034 --> 03:13:08.116]  And it's also our right to speak out against it.
[03:13:08.516 --> 03:13:14.305]  But it's not our right to go out and physically harm people, our call for the harming of others in that.
[03:13:14.325 --> 03:13:16.308]  So I'm going to have David Knight talking about that later on.
[03:13:16.548 --> 03:13:20.134]  But that was exclusive to InfoWars, and that's in a Don Salazar article.
[03:13:21.095 --> 03:13:23.159]  Meanwhile, we have this Craigslist ad.
[03:13:24.437 --> 03:13:28.221]  Oh, before we get to that, let me give out the call-in number.
[03:13:28.241 --> 03:13:28.481]  800-259-9231.
[03:13:28.501 --> 03:13:29.041]  800-259-9231.
[03:13:29.662 --> 03:13:38.850]  I will be taking your calls, especially when David's on, to talk about this issue because I think it's a really important issue that we're not addressing a lot.
[03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:44.235]  And I like the way this gun owner is handling it by offering free gun classes to people.
[03:13:44.636 --> 03:13:45.656]  So maybe the next time...
[03:13:46.357 --> 03:13:54.203]  A shooter goes to a bar and starts shooting it up, or any place where people are, he will be responded back in force by other people.
[03:13:54.263 --> 03:13:55.524]  Notice it didn't happen in Texas.
[03:13:56.304 --> 03:14:01.468]  And notice the last time it did happen in Texas, the guys were taken out before they could get too far from their car.
[03:14:02.388 --> 03:14:05.491]  That's because people in Texas are armed, and you may not know it.
[03:14:05.931 --> 03:14:08.473]  You walk around the office here, there's a lot of people armed.
[03:14:08.773 --> 03:14:10.014]  And we are not afraid.
[03:14:10.574 --> 03:14:13.396]  So, an armed population is a safe and
[03:14:14.707 --> 03:14:16.328]  And very polite population as well.
[03:14:17.409 --> 03:14:17.870]  So here we go.
[03:14:18.250 --> 03:14:21.313]  Craigslist ad threatens Orlando-style massacre in San Diego.
[03:14:21.653 --> 03:14:26.037]  Police are investigating the online threat of violence to San Diego's LGBT community.
[03:14:26.397 --> 03:14:27.298]  That reads here next.
[03:14:27.818 --> 03:14:35.105]  On Tuesday evening, an ABC 10 News viewer saw the post in the men-seeking men section of the Craigslist San Diego personal ads.
[03:14:35.345 --> 03:14:38.147]  He took a screenshot and sent it before the post was flagged and removed.
[03:14:38.608 --> 03:14:40.970]  The post was titled, We Need More Orlandos.
[03:14:41.590 --> 03:14:45.412]  And it's accompanied by a photo of a hand firing a revolver with a bullet coming out of the barrel.
[03:14:45.452 --> 03:14:47.132]  The post reads, Orlando was long overdue.
[03:14:47.452 --> 03:14:50.534]  Cleanse your community of filth that gives decent gay men and women a bad name.
[03:14:50.834 --> 03:14:57.196]  These people were walking disease bug chasers and thank God for AIDS and 9-11 and now Orlando.
[03:14:58.197 --> 03:14:59.197]  San Diego, you're next.
[03:15:01.246 --> 03:15:01.746]  And guess what?
[03:15:01.766 --> 03:15:04.747]  A lot of gun control in San Diego, in California.
[03:15:04.787 --> 03:15:05.867]  It's hard to get guns there.
[03:15:06.387 --> 03:15:08.568]  It's hard to keep them, and you can't get them very fast.
[03:15:09.188 --> 03:15:12.629]  So, of course, that's where you're going to see those types of attacks.
[03:15:12.649 --> 03:15:17.190]  You're going to see them in schools, in bars, places where guns are not allowed.
[03:15:17.570 --> 03:15:20.351]  Meanwhile, we have our reporters heading up to Dallas today.
[03:15:21.889 --> 03:15:25.473]  Dallas police practice riot control ahead of Donald Trump visit.
[03:15:25.953 --> 03:15:34.982]  Dallas police staged demonstration and riot drills Wednesday at Fair Park, the day before large demonstrations are planned against presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
[03:15:35.403 --> 03:15:38.186]  About 600 Dallas police officers participated
[03:15:38.846 --> 03:15:46.612]  In the training with riot helmets and shields, there was smoke to simulate tear gas, and scores of police recruits playing the role of unruly demonstrators.
[03:15:46.932 --> 03:16:08.107]  Hopefully they weren't acting and saying stuff like, oh, we're sovereign citizens, you can't do that to us, which we've seen in the past with our military, because that's who our military is practicing to go after, or at least Homeland Security-controlled military, to go after people who say they're sovereign citizens, not against people who say, you know, they're Islamist radicals, because you can't say that in the military.
[03:16:09.253 --> 03:16:10.775]  And here is this article.
[03:16:11.235 --> 03:16:26.712]  Former CIA head, not the one I chased through the streets of Dresden, but it was General, retired General Michael Hayden, made the point that the national security strategy is being hindered because there's now a hesitance to pursue some cases for fear of being branded a bigot.
[03:16:27.463 --> 03:16:29.665]  Is it possible that people are being politically correct?
[03:16:29.705 --> 03:16:31.126]  He asked Jake Tapper.
[03:16:31.146 --> 03:16:37.492]  And it's interesting, Jake Tapper put out a series of tweets where he is actually questioning radical Islam and its role.
[03:16:37.532 --> 03:16:44.718]  He's not fully pulling the line of CNN, not blaming Islam at all and just saying, well, it's the guns problem.
[03:16:44.739 --> 03:16:51.485]  He's actually taking the role of looking at who's actually shooting the gun instead of blaming the gun itself as an inanimate object.
[03:16:52.365 --> 03:16:55.928]  Once again, our call-in number is 800-259-9231.
[03:16:55.948 --> 03:17:03.112]  800-259-9231 if you want to get in on this conversation and talk about gun rights in this country.
[03:17:03.613 --> 03:17:05.014]  I think they're too restrictive already.
[03:17:05.494 --> 03:17:08.056]  People are coming out of the woodwork saying we have to restrict them.
[03:17:08.116 --> 03:17:12.478]  We saw the piece earlier with the New York Post writer that Alex played.
[03:17:13.439 --> 03:17:15.641]  Where he was afraid and he had PTSD.
[03:17:15.981 --> 03:17:19.143]  You know, notice he didn't say that on video, but he put it in writing later.
[03:17:19.203 --> 03:17:28.249]  He was trying to figure out how he could couch his fear into a more vivid approach of how to explain how guns are scary.
[03:17:28.689 --> 03:17:34.010]  And we, of course, we counter that showing kids shooting AR-15s having no problem and actually liking it.
[03:17:34.291 --> 03:17:36.271]  The one kid said, he goes, how did you feel?
[03:17:36.291 --> 03:17:37.291]  He goes, pretty good.
[03:17:37.692 --> 03:17:39.312]  And he went back and shot a few more rounds off.
[03:17:39.352 --> 03:17:41.413]  We showed little girls shooting the AR-15.
[03:17:41.433 --> 03:17:45.274]  Of course, you had Joe Biden coming out a few years ago saying, buy a shotgun.
[03:17:45.714 --> 03:17:55.917]  And we countered that with videos of women shooting shotguns and falling on their rears because a 12 gauge shotgun does give a big kick, but an AR-15 is a really great gun to shoot.
[03:17:55.997 --> 03:17:57.077]  And it's very easy to shoot.
[03:17:57.737 --> 03:17:58.338]  Many of them.
[03:17:58.738 --> 03:18:04.442]  And they are hunting rifles for those of you out there on Facebook who say, Oh, no, we don't.
[03:18:04.802 --> 03:18:05.603]  We don't need their nose.
[03:18:05.683 --> 03:18:06.504]  Those aren't hunting rifles.
[03:18:06.704 --> 03:18:07.224]  Yeah, they are.
[03:18:07.504 --> 03:18:08.465]  Go hog hunting with them.
[03:18:08.565 --> 03:18:09.606]  You'll be happy you had one.
[03:18:10.894 --> 03:18:12.515]  So back to the General.
[03:18:12.575 --> 03:18:18.337]  He says, you look at the Fort Hood case, when the Army knew Nadal Hassan had become an extremist, and he'd been talking to Anwar al-Awlaki.
[03:18:18.577 --> 03:18:21.898]  Incidentally, Anwar al-Awlaki went to a dinner at the Pentagon right after 9-11.
[03:18:22.258 --> 03:18:24.439]  So he's probably got some CIA ties there.
[03:18:24.879 --> 03:18:27.480]  Is there any hesitance to be branded a bigot?
[03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:31.742]  And then he also brings up Farouk Abdulmutallab, who is the failed underwear bomber.
[03:18:32.708 --> 03:18:35.430]  Interestingly enough, he was given a bomb that could not work.
[03:18:35.930 --> 03:18:44.076]  And I had an argument with the TSA officer when I was going to Dresden, Germany, as we were getting felt up in the Austin airport.
[03:18:44.116 --> 03:18:46.617]  He was saying, well we need these body scanners because of the underwear bomber.
[03:18:46.657 --> 03:18:48.118]  I go, did you know he was given a bomb that couldn't work?
[03:18:48.318 --> 03:18:49.759]  Did you know the FBI knew who he was?
[03:18:49.779 --> 03:18:51.520]  Did you know his father had contacted him?
[03:18:51.741 --> 03:18:59.646]  Did you know that the Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy came out on video later and said, we knew who this guy was and we wanted to follow him.
[03:19:00.106 --> 03:19:05.971]  We were letting him go through his mission because we wanted to see who he was working with.
[03:19:06.232 --> 03:19:23.747]  And then you had lawyer Kurt Haskell come out and come on our show in the beginning and say, hey, this guy was put on this plane by a well-dressed man who spoke perfect English, was an Indian, but spoke in an English accent and brought the guy up and said, hey, he doesn't have a passport, but we do this all the time.
[03:19:24.188 --> 03:19:25.229]  How does that happen?
[03:19:25.729 --> 03:19:30.891]  Okay, but they use these events, and you see he's using this event again, but for a different standpoint.
[03:19:30.931 --> 03:19:43.055]  But they use that event when it first came out to say, we've got to go after people getting on planes, and we have to have these underwear bombs, or have to have these body scanners, because only they could pick up this bomb.
[03:19:43.615 --> 03:19:47.856]  Which of course is a lie, because we've seen how you could fail it with a sewing kit from a dollar store.
[03:19:48.156 --> 03:19:48.917]  We've proven it all!
[03:19:49.217 --> 03:19:50.717]  The government's lying over and over again.
[03:19:50.757 --> 03:19:52.538]  We'll be back with more and your calls coming up.
[03:19:53.138 --> 03:19:54.339]  It's the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:19:54.379 --> 03:19:55.180]  I'm your host Rob Doo.
[03:19:55.220 --> 03:19:55.900]  Thanks for watching.
[03:19:56.241 --> 03:19:59.643]  Infowars.com forward slash show for the live video feed.
[03:19:59.663 --> 03:20:01.405]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[03:20:01.445 --> 03:20:02.526]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:20:02.786 --> 03:20:03.687]  Why is this so good?
[03:20:03.987 --> 03:20:09.211]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:20:09.311 --> 03:20:14.495]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[03:20:15.256 --> 03:20:22.844]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:20:22.904 --> 03:20:29.211]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:20:29.311 --> 03:20:30.572]  These are all parasites.
[03:20:30.632 --> 03:20:31.714]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:20:31.734 --> 03:20:32.795]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:20:33.055 --> 03:20:39.599]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, you have enzyme blend in there.
[03:20:39.619 --> 03:20:47.644]  And this is very important because a lot of these microorganisms, and even going up to tapeworms, pinworms, you have to disintegrate the lining.
[03:20:47.664 --> 03:20:52.667]  I mean, on viruses or protect themselves, and so do bacteria and protozoa and mycoplasms.
[03:20:53.067 --> 03:20:58.491]  They have a protective shell that a lot of times the immune system can't even get into, our own immune system.
[03:20:59.091 --> 03:21:01.814]  Especially since most people's immune system are weak anyway.
[03:21:01.934 --> 03:21:04.496]  People can avoid toxic air if they want.
[03:21:04.536 --> 03:21:06.178]  They can get an air purification system.
[03:21:06.198 --> 03:21:08.820]  They can avoid toxic water and drink clean water.
[03:21:09.240 --> 03:21:12.363]  But it's really hard to avoid parasites.
[03:21:12.864 --> 03:21:15.286]  It's hard to avoid attacking organisms.
[03:21:15.346 --> 03:21:17.128]  And that's where I see this going.
[03:21:17.168 --> 03:21:19.170]  I mean, I think a lot of the information that we
[03:21:19.770 --> 03:21:40.733]  Put out there and a lot of the products that that we develop are specifically for that reason to protect you against the endocrine disrupting chemicals to protect you against all those chemicals and toxins so we actually design the living defense and put in a specific blend of enzymes which actually chew and eat through the lining of these different organisms
[03:21:41.334 --> 03:21:42.955]  So the Living Defense is amazing.
[03:21:43.375 --> 03:21:45.436]  We've seen just tremendous reviews.
[03:21:46.117 --> 03:21:48.278]  How often could you take Living Defense?
[03:21:48.358 --> 03:21:49.679]  I mean, is it a regimen every day?
[03:21:49.719 --> 03:21:51.540]  That's what I was doing until we ran out.
[03:21:51.880 --> 03:21:53.581]  Or do you do it heavier for certain cleanses?
[03:21:53.621 --> 03:21:54.462]  What do you do, Dr. Group?
[03:21:55.142 --> 03:22:06.689]  Well, I do usually six weeks at a time because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites, it's six weeks from the time... So you've got to kill the ones that are in there and then kill their babies when the eggs hatch out.
[03:22:07.009 --> 03:22:21.602]  If you're suffering from abdominal pain, allergies, even like headaches, anemia, weakened immune system, gut problems, depression, hair loss, excess gas, muscle pain, nervousness, I mean all these things.
[03:22:21.662 --> 03:22:28.729]  If you look at some of these conditions and then us opening up our borders and all the other countries opening up their borders.
[03:22:29.289 --> 03:22:39.732]  You're just dealing with a mass amount of parasites or harmful organisms or biological weapons that are spreading and mutating all across the world.
[03:22:39.752 --> 03:22:43.874]  And I think that's one of the reasons why, I mean, all you have to do is look at the news these days.
[03:22:44.454 --> 03:22:46.875]  You can type in refugees spreading disease.
[03:22:46.935 --> 03:22:49.235]  I mean the CDC is going crazy right now.
[03:22:49.856 --> 03:22:54.277]  There's a new antibiotic resistant E. coli that they just identified.
[03:22:54.377 --> 03:22:55.457]  Doctors don't know.
[03:22:55.477 --> 03:22:59.198]  They don't teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms.
[03:22:59.238 --> 03:23:01.359]  There's a reason why they don't teach them about that.
[03:23:01.439 --> 03:23:06.120]  Just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause of disease and how to eliminate it.
[03:23:06.400 --> 03:23:07.421]  All disease out there.
[03:23:07.461 --> 03:23:08.862]  They don't want you to know about it.
[03:23:09.122 --> 03:23:11.825]  You don't want your own immune system being attacked.
[03:23:12.085 --> 03:23:15.487]  Again, you know, you have animals, especially your cats, dogs.
[03:23:15.528 --> 03:23:17.369]  So many people have pets these days.
[03:23:17.849 --> 03:23:19.251]  People eat raw sushi.
[03:23:19.651 --> 03:23:21.292]  People eat more raw food.
[03:23:21.332 --> 03:23:25.556]  You have all these different organisms showing up in the water supplies now.
[03:23:26.036 --> 03:23:29.379]  You even have it in the air supplies, these tiny microorganisms.
[03:23:29.419 --> 03:23:32.221]  So it's not like we can get away from them.
[03:23:32.301 --> 03:23:33.762]  We just have to do everything.
[03:23:33.862 --> 03:23:35.343]  I recommend doing a parasite
[03:23:36.244 --> 03:23:40.706]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:23:40.746 --> 03:23:41.747]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:23:41.787 --> 03:23:42.327]  Living Defense.
[03:23:42.627 --> 03:23:43.668]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:23:43.728 --> 03:23:44.748]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:23:44.768 --> 03:23:46.849]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:23:47.489 --> 03:23:49.350]  And you support the broadcast.
[03:23:49.410 --> 03:23:50.491]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:23:50.771 --> 03:23:52.652]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:23:53.032 --> 03:23:54.993]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:24:23.362 --> 03:24:25.284]  Well this is very precarious.
[03:24:25.685 --> 03:24:28.108]  As you join us back into the fourth hour, I'm your host Rob Dew.
[03:24:28.148 --> 03:24:29.129]  Just saw this on Twitter.
[03:24:30.070 --> 03:24:33.735]  School brands third grader with I need lunch money stamp.
[03:24:33.915 --> 03:24:40.744]  So I guess he came, he went to school without the lunch money and instead of sending the child home with a piece of paper they stamp the child.
[03:24:41.325 --> 03:24:41.805]  Talk about...
[03:24:43.146 --> 03:24:45.027]  Is this a form of bullying and shaming the kids?
[03:24:45.628 --> 03:24:46.008]  Somebody asked.
[03:24:46.028 --> 03:24:48.149]  This happened in Alabama, I believe.
[03:24:48.449 --> 03:24:50.250]  Yeah, Gardendale, Alabama.
[03:24:51.250 --> 03:24:54.152]  And this is all part of the, I guess, the precariat class.
[03:24:54.172 --> 03:25:02.456]  The class that is like, just one, they have jobs, they're employed, but they're one step away from losing it all and then losing it, as Gerald Cilente says.
[03:25:02.476 --> 03:25:06.078]  And that was one of the topics of Bilderberg, was what to do with the precariat class.
[03:25:06.778 --> 03:25:10.640]  And we did an interview, in fact, I don't even know if I put that interview out.
[03:25:10.700 --> 03:25:34.669]  It was with InfoKrieg.com and I need to actually put that interview out because he broke down why they're talking about the precariat class, not because they care about the poor people, but because they want to set up a system where they're getting these monthly stipends and in order to get these monthly stipends you have to maintain the government code of conduct and that's what they'll be setting up and they'll have little minders and enforcers making sure people
[03:25:35.089 --> 03:25:35.930]  I don't think so.
[03:25:51.286 --> 03:25:52.246]  Well, right off the bat.
[03:25:52.806 --> 03:25:55.007]  But let's go to Cindy in Pennsylvania.
[03:25:55.327 --> 03:25:56.247]  I've got other callers, too.
[03:25:56.307 --> 03:26:00.029]  Robert in Alabama, Scott in Illinois, James in Colorado, Curtis in Michigan.
[03:26:00.049 --> 03:26:00.989]  I'm going to get to all of you guys.
[03:26:01.289 --> 03:26:04.430]  But Cindy in Pennsylvania wants to talk about Bilderberg and gun control.
[03:26:04.470 --> 03:26:05.070]  Go ahead, Cindy.
[03:26:06.250 --> 03:26:06.950]  Yeah, hi, Rob.
[03:26:06.970 --> 03:26:08.191]  Can I make two quick points?
[03:26:08.471 --> 03:26:09.011]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:26:10.371 --> 03:26:14.973]  Have you ever noticed when Bilderberg meets, there's always a big shoe that drops?
[03:26:15.933 --> 03:26:18.734]  And the big shoe that dropped was Orlando, Florida.
[03:26:19.673 --> 03:26:27.295]  I think that they were talking gun control as being their next move and making it a big move, which they did.
[03:26:27.495 --> 03:26:31.276]  And they probably have sleeper cells everywhere just waiting for them to make a call.
[03:26:31.996 --> 03:26:35.397]  And I also wanted to mention this Milo Giannopoulos.
[03:26:36.057 --> 03:26:37.818]  He was taken off of Twitter.
[03:26:38.018 --> 03:26:40.999]  He had, what, 30 million followers?
[03:26:41.219 --> 03:26:45.840]  I never heard of him before, but yesterday he was on Drudge.
[03:26:45.980 --> 03:26:48.921]  They gave the link to him and I watched him talk.
[03:26:49.736 --> 03:26:50.656]  In Orlando.
[03:26:51.197 --> 03:26:53.397]  He's very articulate, smart.
[03:26:53.918 --> 03:26:56.258]  He's with the LGBT community.
[03:26:56.598 --> 03:26:57.639]  30 million followers.
[03:26:57.699 --> 03:26:58.579]  They listen to him.
[03:26:59.059 --> 03:27:00.900]  He's pro-Second Amendment.
[03:27:02.080 --> 03:27:07.342]  He knows gay bars are soft kill zones.
[03:27:07.542 --> 03:27:14.445]  I think it would be a good idea to maybe interview him sometime and bring in these 30 million people.
[03:27:14.645 --> 03:27:16.325]  I mean, they buy products too.
[03:27:16.345 --> 03:27:17.746]  That's a lot of people.
[03:27:18.959 --> 03:27:19.699]  Yeah, I would agree.
[03:27:19.719 --> 03:27:22.741]  I don't think he's followed exclusively by LGBT people.
[03:27:22.781 --> 03:27:27.944]  He's also followed by people who have a distaste in their mouth for the social justice warriors out there.
[03:27:27.964 --> 03:27:30.245]  And I think that's probably his biggest audience.
[03:27:31.346 --> 03:27:39.410]  Because he actually comes out against a lot of what the LGBT says in terms of exclusivity and trying to shut people down in their freedom of speech.
[03:27:39.450 --> 03:27:40.711]  He's very pro-freedom of speech.
[03:27:41.471 --> 03:27:48.876]  And we haven't had him on the show before, but we did have Joe Biggs going to California to follow a few of his speeches.
[03:27:48.996 --> 03:27:52.219]  And one actually got shut down due to a bomb threat that happened.
[03:27:52.899 --> 03:27:55.181]  And so people don't like this guy speaking out.
[03:27:55.221 --> 03:28:00.624]  They're very anti-freedom of speech when it comes to not following their views.
[03:28:01.145 --> 03:28:05.288]  But yeah, I'm sure we'd love to have him on the show.
[03:28:05.528 --> 03:28:06.869]  And I think we've reached out to him.
[03:28:07.509 --> 03:28:11.853]  Alex regularly speaks to one of the main editors of Breitbart, and that's who he works for.
[03:28:11.893 --> 03:28:13.594]  He's a tech editor at Breitbart.
[03:28:13.614 --> 03:28:16.156]  But as for Bilderberg and false flags, that's what I thought.
[03:28:16.597 --> 03:28:26.024]  We were at the airport that morning chasing the Bilderbergers around, asking them questions, and it was Josh Owens who saw the headline.
[03:28:26.044 --> 03:28:28.707]  He goes, oh my god, 20 people were just shot in Orlando.
[03:28:28.747 --> 03:28:35.932]  And I said, wow, this is going to take all the, take the eye of what people are looking at, especially the eye of drudge, as I say, from
[03:28:36.853 --> 03:29:03.622]  Bilderberg, which he was covering every day, and then shifted over to this shooting and kind of take people off their real controllers, but into an event where you could have CNN and other mainstream media outlets come out and say, oh, we've got to call for guns, we've got to call for the banning of guns, and this, of course, gives President Obama the chance to get up on screen and do his fake tears and say he's sick and tired of this, but he won't say the words radical Islam, even though the last two big shootings were radical Islam.
[03:29:04.102 --> 03:29:06.626]  So I would agree to you on both points, Cindy.
[03:29:06.646 --> 03:29:07.487]  Thanks for calling in.
[03:29:08.689 --> 03:29:11.693]  Let's go now to who's been waiting the longest.
[03:29:12.174 --> 03:29:13.836]  It looks like everybody pretty much the same.
[03:29:13.896 --> 03:29:16.280]  Curtis in Michigan wants to talk about gun control.
[03:29:16.760 --> 03:29:18.202]  Curtis, are you a gun owner yourself?
[03:29:20.334 --> 03:29:21.435]  I'm not a gun owner yet.
[03:29:21.535 --> 03:29:22.876]  I am looking into getting a gun.
[03:29:23.957 --> 03:29:27.999]  But my main points are, I'll keep it short, gun control never worked.
[03:29:28.340 --> 03:29:32.783]  Just like the drug war, the black market, you know, that's always going to exist.
[03:29:33.023 --> 03:29:37.586]  And if you want to shoot up a nightclub or a mall or whatever, they're going to find a gun.
[03:29:37.886 --> 03:29:40.147]  And getting it legally is irrelevant.
[03:29:40.187 --> 03:29:40.828]  I would agree.
[03:29:41.048 --> 03:29:41.628]  Hey, hang on tight.
[03:29:41.648 --> 03:29:42.529]  I'm going to hold you over the break.
[03:29:42.549 --> 03:29:44.010]  We'll come back with you and let you finish your point.
[03:29:44.430 --> 03:29:45.491]  Rob Dew at the 4th Hour.
[03:29:45.831 --> 03:29:48.053]  Infowars.com forward slash show for the free streams.
[03:29:48.871 --> 03:29:49.752]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.252 --> 03:29:51.893]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.233 --> 03:29:52.674]  Hold him over.
[03:29:52.794 --> 03:29:55.456]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.495 --> 03:30:14.001]  I don't think so.
[03:30:47.105 --> 03:30:51.320]  If I was just gonna, like, attach an idea to it, it's gonna be dangerous freedom.
[03:31:00.348 --> 03:31:04.911]  A British Member of Parliament has just been shot with a handgun and stabbed to death with a knife.
[03:31:05.191 --> 03:31:10.114]  The killer got a job six years ago working in a park after being referred by a mental health clinic.
[03:31:10.294 --> 03:31:15.478]  He said working in the park was, quote, better than all the psychotherapy and medication in the world.
[03:31:15.758 --> 03:31:22.102]  This happens exactly one week before the Brexit vote, the referendum on whether Britain will leave the European Union, a fear campaign
[03:31:22.142 --> 03:31:22.502]  I don't know.
[03:31:41.522 --> 03:31:44.004]  And to energize the supporters of globalism.
[03:31:44.225 --> 03:31:47.508]  They report the mentally ill man shouted Britain first as he shot.
[03:31:47.848 --> 03:31:51.572]  The UK got gun control decades ago and of course murder rates soared.
[03:31:51.892 --> 03:31:57.658]  So it won't be used to push for gun control but it will be used to try to energize the supporters of globalism.
[03:31:57.678 --> 03:31:59.600]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:32:00.174 --> 03:32:09.199]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:32:09.279 --> 03:32:17.363]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:32:17.663 --> 03:32:22.365]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:32:22.545 --> 03:32:29.268]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:29.328 --> 03:32:36.410]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:32:36.510 --> 03:32:43.373]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:32:43.533 --> 03:32:47.876]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:32:48.016 --> 03:32:51.279]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:32:51.399 --> 03:32:57.524]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:32:57.704 --> 03:32:59.405]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:33:07.051 --> 03:33:10.574]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:33:11.054 --> 03:33:12.836]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:21.079 --> 03:33:31.245]  Alright, so sitting over to my left, David Knight.
[03:33:31.265 --> 03:33:32.706]  I wasn't sure if I was live at that point.
[03:33:32.826 --> 03:33:34.307]  Usually they pop in and say, you're live!
[03:33:35.848 --> 03:33:38.530]  But the liner had finished, so I just automatically went into it.
[03:33:39.830 --> 03:33:40.250]  It's a lie.
[03:33:40.310 --> 03:33:40.890]  We're lying.
[03:33:41.010 --> 03:33:41.491]  It's right.
[03:33:41.511 --> 03:33:42.571]  I got David Knight over to my left.
[03:33:42.591 --> 03:33:46.352]  We're going to talk about kind of what you and Leanne talked about a little bit last night.
[03:33:46.572 --> 03:33:49.613]  What would Jesus do at the Gay Bar shooting?
[03:33:49.973 --> 03:33:51.853]  A lesson in religious extremism.
[03:33:53.074 --> 03:33:57.255]  But I'm going to let Curtis, before that, finish up with his gun control remarks.
[03:33:57.275 --> 03:33:58.715]  He already said, you know, look at the drug war.
[03:33:59.315 --> 03:33:59.915]  It doesn't work.
[03:34:00.736 --> 03:34:01.536]  We still have drugs.
[03:34:01.576 --> 03:34:02.456]  You can still buy drugs.
[03:34:02.716 --> 03:34:05.897]  I could go to 20 different places in Austin right now and get whatever I want.
[03:34:06.690 --> 03:34:08.972]  And the government outlaws it, and it doesn't matter.
[03:34:09.273 --> 03:34:11.515]  So when they outlaw guns, the same thing will happen.
[03:34:11.775 --> 03:34:12.656]  And is that how you want it?
[03:34:12.936 --> 03:34:14.458]  Right now, it is sort of controlled.
[03:34:14.478 --> 03:34:18.622]  I almost wouldn't mind a black market, because then the government wouldn't know if I have a gun.
[03:34:18.903 --> 03:34:22.967]  But, you know, right now they do a background check, and the government knows, hey, this person did a background check.
[03:34:22.987 --> 03:34:23.948]  We've got to put him on a list.
[03:34:24.068 --> 03:34:29.814]  My son said the only good thing about gun control, gun prohibition, is going to be you're going to see all kinds of really interesting guns created.
[03:34:30.134 --> 03:34:30.394]  Oh yeah.
[03:34:30.414 --> 03:34:37.501]  You never even dreamed of, just like you saw all kinds of interesting, new, and very, very dangerous drugs created from drug prohibition.
[03:34:37.521 --> 03:34:38.883]  They talk about, hey, it's too easy to get it.
[03:34:38.903 --> 03:34:42.326]  And it's like, yeah, kind of like buying drugs at a school playground.
[03:34:42.446 --> 03:34:45.129]  You can do that after 45 years of drug prohibition.
[03:34:45.189 --> 03:34:46.590]  And of course, nothing's going to change with guns.
[03:34:46.650 --> 03:34:47.211]  There you go.
[03:34:47.591 --> 03:34:48.992]  Now, hey, Curtis, I'm gonna let you finish up.
[03:34:49.032 --> 03:34:49.313]  Go ahead.
[03:34:51.270 --> 03:34:51.711]  Uh, yeah.
[03:34:51.831 --> 03:34:53.792]  I mean, David Knight's completely right.
[03:34:54.033 --> 03:34:58.216]  Uh, you know, with the prohibition of LSD and stuff like that, I'm not, uh, advocating for that.
[03:34:58.256 --> 03:35:03.981]  But, you know, there's much more dangerous designer drugs that are much like it now, and they're very dangerous, you know?
[03:35:04.602 --> 03:35:09.766]  Um, but with my point, you know, they take away freedom little by little to get people compliant and docile.
[03:35:10.336 --> 03:35:16.603]  And for people who say that the only way to stop these shootings is for gun control, I would respectfully disagree.
[03:35:16.623 --> 03:35:20.667]  I believe to stop these shootings, everybody just needs to be armed.
[03:35:20.927 --> 03:35:24.651]  If you want to protect yourself, you need to take the measures to protect yourself.
[03:35:24.992 --> 03:35:26.433]  And that's all I got.
[03:35:26.553 --> 03:35:27.815]  You guys do a wonderful job.
[03:35:27.875 --> 03:35:28.956]  I'm taking my Supermail.
[03:35:30.316 --> 03:35:31.637]  Everybody can buy the products.
[03:35:31.877 --> 03:35:33.218]  They're good stuff.
[03:35:33.678 --> 03:35:34.539]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:35:47.668 --> 03:35:50.090]  That other people have different opinions.
[03:36:04.261 --> 03:36:08.264]  That's right, but we're not doing too good with these secret watch lists.
[03:36:08.444 --> 03:36:20.773]  It perverts the entire Bill of Rights and it really causes me to concern to see the NRA as well as Donald Trump start to talk about this because that is the narrative of Obama and the gun controllers from the left for this.
[03:36:20.973 --> 03:36:29.475]  Well, hopefully when he meets with them, they go, sir, that's not a good move because we don't even know how you get on these watch lists or how you get off of them.
[03:36:29.515 --> 03:36:30.635]  There's no due process.
[03:36:30.996 --> 03:36:33.376]  It's a government lackey saying, we don't like you.
[03:36:33.876 --> 03:36:40.358]  We had a guy on the show who flew out of the country and then couldn't fly back in because he had gotten mistakenly put on one of these lists.
[03:36:40.438 --> 03:36:40.758]  First story
[03:37:02.500 --> 03:37:03.761]  Where do I go to clear my name?
[03:37:03.961 --> 03:37:05.742]  You don't have due process.
[03:37:05.982 --> 03:37:06.803]  Sounds like 1984.
[03:37:06.863 --> 03:37:09.664]  We've shown clips of little kids being on the watch list.
[03:37:09.704 --> 03:37:13.927]  I put one of those clips in Police State 4, the rise of FEMA.
[03:37:13.947 --> 03:37:18.449]  There was a little kid, it was during the underwear bomber segment, a little kid who ended up on the no-fly list.
[03:37:18.489 --> 03:37:18.670]  Yeah.
[03:37:18.990 --> 03:37:19.290]  Okay?
[03:37:19.570 --> 03:37:20.210]  It doesn't work.
[03:37:20.511 --> 03:37:22.332]  It's done by the government, it's not going to work right.
[03:37:22.472 --> 03:37:24.493]  That's one thing you can rest assured.
[03:37:24.593 --> 03:37:26.574]  The watch lists are far more dangerous.
[03:37:26.594 --> 03:37:27.695]  We need watch list control.
[03:37:28.155 --> 03:37:28.776]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:37:28.796 --> 03:37:30.177]  We need watch list extermination.
[03:37:30.217 --> 03:37:31.218]  We need government control.
[03:37:31.258 --> 03:37:32.319]  We need less government.
[03:37:32.379 --> 03:37:34.841]  Government is the problem and it always will be.
[03:37:35.241 --> 03:37:39.424]  Okay, government's not out there fixing your roads or making your electricity bills cheaper.
[03:37:39.644 --> 03:37:41.266]  They're making everything more expensive.
[03:37:41.566 --> 03:37:43.067]  They're making everything more bureaucratic.
[03:37:43.087 --> 03:37:44.488]  They're making everything slower.
[03:37:45.529 --> 03:37:48.271]  When I was in Europe so many times, just, do you have this paper?
[03:37:48.291 --> 03:37:49.012]  Do you have this paper?
[03:37:49.032 --> 03:37:49.773]  Do you have this paper?
[03:37:50.313 --> 03:37:51.014]  It was ridiculous.
[03:37:51.834 --> 03:38:04.808]  I was trying to pay, we went and shot this amazing interview at this church in the Czech Republic, and just to pay them the money to do this took 45 minutes of talking back and forth.
[03:38:05.349 --> 03:38:06.190]  I was amazed, I'm like...
[03:38:06.590 --> 03:38:08.131]  Jesus, do you guys want the money or not?
[03:38:08.171 --> 03:38:08.792]  I'm ready to go.
[03:38:08.812 --> 03:38:10.433]  I don't want to sit here and have this conversation.
[03:38:10.773 --> 03:38:12.394]  Well, what are you paying it for?
[03:38:12.694 --> 03:38:14.676]  I'm paying it to go shoot the video.
[03:38:14.736 --> 03:38:21.040]  And then that went back and forth because the director didn't speak English, but it's just bureaucracy in action and you're seeing it there and it's just amazing.
[03:38:21.400 --> 03:38:26.524]  But David, let's get into what would Jesus do at the gay bar shooting which just happened in Orlando.
[03:38:26.564 --> 03:38:29.046]  So you had this interesting concept
[03:38:29.466 --> 03:38:31.367]  And it's basically the Muslims seem to be for it.
[03:38:31.387 --> 03:38:33.088]  They seem to be going, kill gays, kill gays.
[03:38:33.108 --> 03:38:38.510]  And now we have this extreme religious right who also seem to be celebrating these killings.
[03:38:38.730 --> 03:38:39.971]  And I've never seen that before.
[03:38:40.011 --> 03:38:41.652]  And that's something that really concerned me.
[03:38:41.672 --> 03:38:43.413]  And you know, I put this title up.
[03:38:43.433 --> 03:38:50.236]  You know, a lot of Christians see the WWJD brand of stuff at the Christian bookstores, especially the Baptist bookstores.
[03:38:50.256 --> 03:38:53.057]  You get little bracelets that say, what would Jesus do?
[03:38:53.317 --> 03:38:54.318]  Think about what you're doing.
[03:38:54.638 --> 03:38:55.738]  Would Jesus be doing this?
[03:38:56.019 --> 03:38:56.739]  That type of thing.
[03:38:57.179 --> 03:38:59.981]  And so I said, you know, what would Jesus do at a gay bar shooting?
[03:39:00.441 --> 03:39:00.741]  Okay?
[03:39:00.821 --> 03:39:04.263]  Would he join in and, hey, give me a gun, I want to shoot some gays?
[03:39:04.343 --> 03:39:07.405]  Or would he have sacrificed himself for them?
[03:39:07.625 --> 03:39:07.885]  Okay?
[03:39:08.225 --> 03:39:12.788]  And amazingly, I saw some comments from people saying, Jesus wouldn't even be at a gay bar!
[03:39:13.488 --> 03:39:17.630]  No, one of the things that he was attacked for during his life was the fact that he hung out with sinners.
[03:39:17.690 --> 03:39:20.832]  He hung out with tax collectors and prostitutes and people.
[03:39:20.972 --> 03:39:21.252]  Why?
[03:39:21.612 --> 03:39:22.272]  Because you know what?
[03:39:22.312 --> 03:39:25.934]  He's making the point, he came to this earth to save sinners.
[03:39:26.414 --> 03:39:28.015]  And that's what Christianity is about.
[03:39:28.035 --> 03:39:32.337]  It's not about telling us that we need to kill people because they're sinners.
[03:39:32.757 --> 03:39:35.802]  It's about telling people that Jesus died because you're a sinner.
[03:39:35.862 --> 03:39:41.129]  It's about offering a message of hope, a message of freedom, not a message of legalism.
[03:39:41.189 --> 03:39:47.439]  And so, yeah, I've heard some legalistic pastors before, and I've been to some legalistic churches before, but I've not seen this type of thing.
[03:39:47.879 --> 03:39:49.180]  And so last night we were talking about it.
[03:39:49.280 --> 03:39:51.743]  Leanne was talking about it from the Islamic side.
[03:39:51.763 --> 03:39:52.804]  She gave me this article today.
[03:39:52.844 --> 03:39:54.125]  A gay Muslim says, hey, you know what?
[03:39:54.345 --> 03:39:56.247]  Islam is not a religion of peace.
[03:39:56.707 --> 03:39:58.990]  He says, calling Islam a religion of peace is dangerous.
[03:39:59.050 --> 03:39:59.690]  It's reductive.
[03:40:00.111 --> 03:40:03.374]  Like the other two monotheisms that precede it, it has blood on its hands.
[03:40:03.634 --> 03:40:04.535]  Let me say this, okay?
[03:40:04.835 --> 03:40:05.135]  It isn't.
[03:40:05.416 --> 03:40:07.478]  This is not just a function of monotheisms.
[03:40:07.899 --> 03:40:09.561]  It's a function of all religions.
[03:40:09.861 --> 03:40:10.081]  Okay?
[03:40:10.121 --> 03:40:14.306]  Polytheists were sacrificing children, doing blood sacrifices of children.
[03:40:14.467 --> 03:40:20.394]  We've had atheists who have gone out of their way to murder people, especially believers, but also other atheists.
[03:40:20.894 --> 03:40:25.598]  Whether you believe in God or whether you're not, there's every kind of culture, every kind of religion has got blood on its hands.
[03:40:25.618 --> 03:40:29.782]  It's a function of taking an ideology and twisting it and then saying, hey, it's okay to kill people.
[03:40:29.822 --> 03:40:30.242]  That's right.
[03:40:30.302 --> 03:40:30.763]  That's what it is.
[03:40:30.783 --> 03:40:31.704]  It's people doing this.
[03:40:31.784 --> 03:40:34.766]  Once again, once again, it's people doing it, not the guns, not the religion.
[03:40:34.906 --> 03:40:35.347]  Exactly.
[03:40:35.367 --> 03:40:39.010]  They may be doing it in the name of religion, but that's not necessarily what the religion called for.
[03:40:39.130 --> 03:40:44.352]  And so the real issue before us is not what has happened historically, but what is happening now.
[03:40:44.672 --> 03:40:46.653]  And what is the basis of Islam?
[03:40:46.673 --> 03:40:47.994]  What is the basis of Christianity?
[03:40:48.014 --> 03:40:49.634]  Well, I'm not going to try to talk about Islam.
[03:40:49.994 --> 03:40:58.278]  There's plenty of people who are Muslims who will tell you that it is not a religion of peace, that what we saw here was not a misinterpretation of their theology, but an expression of it.
[03:40:58.878 --> 03:41:02.280]  Okay, but what I'm concerned about, what I want to talk about is the reaction of some of these pastors.
[03:41:02.300 --> 03:41:03.380]  So we've got a couple of pastors.
[03:41:04.301 --> 03:41:10.084]  Roger Jimenez of Verity Baptist Church said the killer succeeded in making Orlando safer.
[03:41:10.104 --> 03:41:12.565]  He said, are you sad 50 pedophiles were killed today?
[03:41:13.065 --> 03:41:14.766]  No, I think it's great, he said.
[03:41:14.826 --> 03:41:15.987]  I think that helps society.
[03:41:16.067 --> 03:41:18.548]  I think Orlando, Florida is a little safer tonight.
[03:41:18.968 --> 03:41:25.211]  And then we got Tempe, Arizona preacher Steven Anderson, who said, well, there's at least 50 less pedophiles in the world.
[03:41:25.271 --> 03:41:31.114]  He said LGBT people should be executed properly, however, by a righteous government.
[03:41:31.134 --> 03:41:35.756]  And Jimenez also said, I just wish the government would round them all up, put them up against a wall.
[03:41:36.616 --> 03:41:38.597]  Put a firing squad in front of them and blow their brains out.
[03:41:38.738 --> 03:41:39.098]  That's right.
[03:41:39.478 --> 03:41:46.143]  And so what we have to be concerned about, and that's the reason we have the First Amendment, we want a separation of religion from the state, okay?
[03:41:46.463 --> 03:41:49.125]  And I know that that's not in the Constitution.
[03:41:49.165 --> 03:41:58.211]  That wall of separation was something that Thomas Jefferson sent out as reassurances to people who had been told by John Adams that he was going to come around and steal their Bible, so they're burying them in the backyard.
[03:41:58.471 --> 03:42:01.273]  He said, no, there's a wall that protects you from the government.
[03:42:01.313 --> 03:42:02.254]  That's the First Amendment.
[03:42:02.654 --> 03:42:04.336]  But we don't want a theocracy either.
[03:42:04.916 --> 03:42:08.260]  And what people have to understand is that Islam does want a theocracy.
[03:42:08.380 --> 03:42:09.901]  It is endemic to its religion.
[03:42:09.941 --> 03:42:18.070]  And now I'm starting to see some of these same aspects in some of these Christians who are preaching, hey, we want the government to go out and round up gays and kill them.
[03:42:18.390 --> 03:42:20.172]  And we saw this back in the fall.
[03:42:20.752 --> 03:42:22.714]  ...as they were coming to the Iowa caucus.
[03:42:22.754 --> 03:42:27.577]  Remember, and this is something I didn't even see for a couple months, we had this meeting in Des Moines, Iowa.
[03:42:27.597 --> 03:42:29.519]  It was a National Religious Liberties Conference.
[03:42:30.119 --> 03:42:32.761]  It featured a lot of presidential candidates.
[03:42:32.821 --> 03:42:36.144]  They had Mike Huckabee, Bobby Jindal, and Ted Cruz.
[03:42:36.204 --> 03:42:40.667]  And of course, after they dropped out and Ted Cruz was there, people played this clip.
[03:42:40.687 --> 03:42:42.709]  And I want to play this clip right now, what this guy said.
[03:42:45.071 --> 03:42:49.094]  ...13 calls for the death penalty for homosexuals.
[03:42:50.683 --> 03:42:51.103]  Yes!
[03:42:52.805 --> 03:42:57.928]  Romans 1, verse 32, the Apostle Paul does say that homosexuals...
[03:43:00.048 --> 03:43:12.861]  And let me say that is not the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[03:43:13.121 --> 03:43:14.282]  Gospel is good news.
[03:43:14.623 --> 03:43:18.206]  What he is doing is he's taking us out of context, completely out of context.
[03:43:18.506 --> 03:43:23.071]  And when you take something out of context, Rob, you use it as a pretext for your prejudices.
[03:43:23.291 --> 03:43:24.412]  That's what this man is doing.
[03:43:24.733 --> 03:43:25.754]  That is not Christianity.
[03:43:26.074 --> 03:43:27.095]  That is not the Gospel.
[03:43:27.395 --> 03:43:29.858]  Mike Huckabee said he didn't know anything about that guy.
[03:43:29.878 --> 03:43:34.082]  Ted Cruz... Didn't he introduce Ted Cruz right after that?
[03:43:34.142 --> 03:43:35.203]  That's right, he introduced Ted Cruz.
[03:43:35.243 --> 03:43:38.106]  And let me tell you, he's quoting the Bible, okay?
[03:43:38.166 --> 03:43:40.609]  And he's taking it out of context, because what he says is, look...
[03:43:41.329 --> 03:43:45.774]  Uh, just before that, where he says, God says that all these people deserve death.
[03:43:46.014 --> 03:43:46.275]  Okay?
[03:43:46.335 --> 03:43:48.037]  What Paul is doing is he's laying this out.
[03:43:48.057 --> 03:43:49.138]  A lot of people understand this.
[03:43:49.178 --> 03:43:50.399]  They call it the Roman's Road.
[03:43:50.840 --> 03:43:52.461]  Paul says, look, we're all sinners.
[03:43:52.822 --> 03:43:53.783]  We all deserve death.
[03:43:54.183 --> 03:43:58.708]  And he goes out and he lays out this catalog of every possible thing you could do.
[03:43:59.429 --> 03:44:00.669]  And it's not just homosexuality.
[03:44:00.709 --> 03:44:03.670]  And yet these legalists will go in and they'll pull out homosexuality.
[03:44:03.690 --> 03:44:05.411]  They'll look at it and say, well, gee, I do that.
[03:44:05.451 --> 03:44:06.051]  I'm a liar.
[03:44:06.071 --> 03:44:07.752]  You know, I do this, this, this.
[03:44:07.792 --> 03:44:08.452]  I'm an adulterer.
[03:44:08.712 --> 03:44:09.272]  I steal money.
[03:44:09.652 --> 03:44:10.713]  I don't do homosexuality.
[03:44:10.753 --> 03:44:16.975]  Let's go after the homosexuals because it makes me feel like I'm justifying myself before God to attack this other group.
[03:44:17.295 --> 03:44:20.596]  And so he says, yeah, God knows that all these people who do this deserve death.
[03:44:20.636 --> 03:44:21.836]  But what did he say right before it?
[03:44:22.177 --> 03:44:24.937]  He said they've become filled with every kind of wickedness, with envy.
[03:44:24.997 --> 03:44:26.238]  Are we supposed to kill people who envy?
[03:44:26.778 --> 03:44:33.349]  With murder, with strife, with deceit, with malice, they gossip, they slander, they hate God, they're insolent, arrogant, boastful.
[03:44:33.950 --> 03:44:34.992]  They disobey their parents.
[03:44:35.012 --> 03:44:37.476]  So are we supposed to kill everybody on that list?
[03:44:37.496 --> 03:44:38.678]  My mom wants me to vote for Hillary.
[03:44:40.287 --> 03:44:46.511]  The whole point of this is Paul is laying down a pattern to tell people there's no such thing as a small sin.
[03:44:46.851 --> 03:44:48.192]  There are no peccadillos.
[03:44:48.572 --> 03:44:50.834]  Every sin is cosmic rebellion to God.
[03:44:51.194 --> 03:44:58.639]  And so what he's saying is, he goes on later in the book, he says, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[03:44:59.079 --> 03:45:02.720]  He says, the wages, what you deserve of sin, are death.
[03:45:03.180 --> 03:45:06.822]  But the gift of God is eternal life through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[03:45:07.262 --> 03:45:11.303]  That is what's different about Christianity versus all the other man-made religions, okay?
[03:45:11.563 --> 03:45:14.144]  And these people are making Christianity into a man-made religion.
[03:45:14.564 --> 03:45:18.065]  The difference with Christianity is that God offers us free grace.
[03:45:18.486 --> 03:45:19.866]  And he quotes another one.
[03:45:19.926 --> 03:45:21.366]  He quotes another one from 1 Corinthians.
[03:45:21.386 --> 03:45:25.987]  And again, here's another one where he puts out a long list of sins.
[03:45:26.147 --> 03:45:27.127]  Fornicators, okay?
[03:45:27.167 --> 03:45:27.708]  Adulterers.
[03:45:27.928 --> 03:45:30.428]  They're not calling for adulterers to be executed, okay?
[03:45:30.808 --> 03:45:35.369]  They do list homosexuals, sodomites, thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, extortioners.
[03:45:35.669 --> 03:45:38.710]  None of these will inherit the kingdom of God, and such were some of you.
[03:45:39.530 --> 03:45:42.191]  But you were justified and forgiven because of what Christ did.
[03:45:42.211 --> 03:45:43.851]  So yeah, would Christ be at the gay bar?
[03:45:44.111 --> 03:45:44.271]  Yeah.
[03:45:45.066 --> 03:45:46.067]  He came to save sinners.
[03:45:46.367 --> 03:45:50.551]  And so he would be there, he would be with the people, he would even be with the sinners at church, okay?
[03:45:50.751 --> 03:45:52.272]  Because he came to save everybody.
[03:45:52.733 --> 03:45:54.074]  And he was the one who died.
[03:45:54.114 --> 03:45:56.316]  He doesn't call us to kill other people.
[03:45:56.536 --> 03:45:58.938]  He doesn't call us to create a government to do that.
[03:45:59.178 --> 03:46:04.402]  And I understand how it's difficult for a lot of Christians to hate the sin and not hate the sinner because
[03:46:05.163 --> 03:46:12.650]  Some of the people, most of these sins, people don't have parades to talk about how they're adulterers, but they do have parades to talk about how they're homosexuals.
[03:46:13.091 --> 03:46:17.275]  And so when we talk about this, we're trying to tell people, look, God has got a better way for all of us.
[03:46:17.455 --> 03:46:19.097]  We've all got something that we're struggling with.
[03:46:20.578 --> 03:46:25.802]  When they do that, and when they come in and force us and coerce us, now we start to get into the political realm.
[03:46:26.243 --> 03:46:38.453]  When they start to come to a baker or a photographer and say, you're going to come and perform at my wedding, or a band, you're going to come and perform at my wedding, or I'm going to shut you down as a business, that makes them very angry.
[03:46:38.473 --> 03:46:41.816]  And I have to say to them, Christians need to rise above that.
[03:46:42.156 --> 03:46:43.997]  Yes, we need to fight that kind of hatred.
[03:46:44.238 --> 03:46:47.880]  We need to fight it politically, but we don't need to use religion to do that.
[03:46:47.940 --> 03:46:50.402]  We don't need to pervert the gospel of Christ.
[03:46:50.422 --> 03:46:51.323]  That's not the good news.
[03:46:51.463 --> 03:46:59.049]  And we need to protect our kids as well from, and I'm not saying all gays are like that, but you do have pedophiles out there that we must protect our kids from.
[03:46:59.089 --> 03:46:59.249]  Yeah.
[03:46:59.669 --> 03:47:02.091]  Let's go to Scott in Illinois and get his reaction to that.
[03:47:02.131 --> 03:47:04.593]  He lists himself as a radical Christian.
[03:47:05.053 --> 03:47:07.015]  Scott, what's your take on what David Knight just had to say?
[03:47:08.425 --> 03:47:10.866]  Oh, I'd just say amen to everything.
[03:47:11.006 --> 03:47:18.850]  Don't need to repeat it all, but I told your call screener that my friends consider me radical.
[03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:32.195]  I don't label myself as radical, but when my friends have problems, they come to me, tell me their problems, I listen and I pray, and I ask for Jesus, you know, to help them, or I ask the Holy Spirit to help them.
[03:47:34.130 --> 03:47:37.072]  You know, thanks for taking my call.
[03:47:37.152 --> 03:47:51.003]  It's a real interesting topic, and I just feel really, really sad that there are people that call themselves Christians, whether they're radical or not, that would say that it's the right thing to do, and go kill gay people.
[03:47:51.063 --> 03:47:53.846]  That is not... And where would Jesus be?
[03:47:54.366 --> 03:47:56.808]  The Jesus that I serve, He would be there
[03:47:57.626 --> 03:48:00.567]  At that nightclub, raising those people from the dead.
[03:48:01.027 --> 03:48:08.909]  Now, I don't know where the chicken-hearted Christians were that were not down there ministering to these people after this slaughter.
[03:48:09.129 --> 03:48:09.729]  That's a good point.
[03:48:10.630 --> 03:48:15.891]  I mean, and my goodness, I mean, I know Billy, Billy Graham's still alive.
[03:48:16.831 --> 03:48:23.193]  I'd be, you know, this is a spiritual problem and you just can't, if we took all the crooked bankers
[03:48:23.843 --> 03:48:24.143]  Mm-hmm.
[03:48:42.547 --> 03:48:46.308]  Satan is the cancer, and Jesus is the answer.
[03:48:46.648 --> 03:48:54.590]  It is not Buddha, Mohammed, or Krishna, and I'm not opposed to having those people live in my neighborhood.
[03:48:54.910 --> 03:49:00.772]  What I am opposed to is giving them free passes and making them have special rights.
[03:49:01.332 --> 03:49:09.294]  My goodness, if I went out and had a prayer meeting on Rush Street, which is in Chicago, less than 40 minutes from my house,
[03:49:10.047 --> 03:49:18.649]  If I would take political action and try and close down that street, you had some guy on your program the other day.
[03:49:20.370 --> 03:49:23.510]  It's political Islam that is our enemy.
[03:49:23.950 --> 03:49:25.371]  That's our spiritual enemy.
[03:49:26.011 --> 03:49:33.433]  And they're trying to use political Islam as trying to use our religious freedoms, our social freedoms.
[03:49:35.006 --> 03:49:38.650]  You know, if you are a Christian, you can't harbor hate for people.
[03:49:38.990 --> 03:49:41.412]  You can harbor hate for sin.
[03:49:41.773 --> 03:49:42.934]  That's what my Bible says.
[03:49:42.954 --> 03:49:45.777]  You have to hate the sin, and not the people.
[03:49:46.237 --> 03:49:47.478]  Jesus wouldn't be down there.
[03:49:49.304 --> 03:49:51.266]  Scott, you're on a roll.
[03:49:51.306 --> 03:49:52.087]  Thanks for calling in.
[03:49:52.227 --> 03:49:53.368]  That was great.
[03:49:53.468 --> 03:50:01.335]  And this is not a topic that's really... It is cut and dry, but it's not cut and dry in the way you've been talking about it.
[03:50:01.495 --> 03:50:03.296]  You know, nobody's really talking about it from that angle.
[03:50:03.757 --> 03:50:12.785]  Well, you know, when I look at what Steven Anderson said, he says the bad news is that these homosexuals still alive, they're going to be attacking Christians and they're going to be pushing gun control.
[03:50:13.025 --> 03:50:15.387]  Well, they're going to use what he said to push gun control.
[03:50:15.407 --> 03:50:16.328]  They're going to use what he said
[03:50:16.408 --> 03:50:17.408]  To attack Christians, too.
[03:50:35.453 --> 03:50:36.935]  And I don't agree with that either.
[03:50:36.955 --> 03:50:37.936]  That's crossing the line.
[03:50:37.996 --> 03:50:38.516]  That's your right.
[03:50:38.556 --> 03:50:41.079]  Why would you want somebody to bake your cake if they don't want to?
[03:50:41.259 --> 03:50:41.620]  That's right.
[03:50:41.660 --> 03:50:42.340]  Would you want that?
[03:50:42.360 --> 03:50:44.282]  They're going to put a little extra baking soda in it.
[03:50:44.302 --> 03:50:44.863]  They don't want it.
[03:50:44.903 --> 03:50:46.044]  They just want to punish people.
[03:50:46.144 --> 03:50:46.605]  Exactly.
[03:50:46.625 --> 03:50:47.226]  That's what we understand.
[03:50:47.246 --> 03:50:47.586]  Exactly.
[03:50:47.606 --> 03:50:48.907]  We're going to be back with a final segment.
[03:50:48.927 --> 03:50:53.012]  That's where I'm doing David Knight with the fourth hour of Overdrive, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:50:53.052 --> 03:50:55.154]  Infowars.com forward slash show for the free streams.
[03:50:55.214 --> 03:50:56.756]  Tell all your friends about it right now.
[03:51:00.874 --> 03:51:07.197]  I got so busy fighting the globalists for 15 years, I turned into a giant fat slob when I was an exercise fanatic before.
[03:51:07.597 --> 03:51:10.698]  Now in the last five years, I set out to try to get back in shape.
[03:51:11.119 --> 03:51:22.964]  And to help turbocharge that, I talked to top scientists and nutraceutical developers and said, I want something that blocks these estrogen mimickers, something that helps me get back to what a real male was like instead of this globalist bombardment.
[03:51:23.544 --> 03:51:26.325]  We developed Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[03:51:26.505 --> 03:51:27.365]  They're best sellers.
[03:51:27.586 --> 03:51:28.906]  They're loved across the industry.
[03:51:29.066 --> 03:51:29.686]  They're amazing.
[03:51:29.946 --> 03:51:34.328]  You owe it to yourself to get a bottle of Super Male Vitality today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:51:34.708 --> 03:51:37.769]  Folks, it's so amazing what Mother Nature gave us.
[03:51:38.069 --> 03:51:41.271]  You're crazy if you don't at least try a bottle of this, because you can't lose.
[03:51:41.511 --> 03:51:49.974]  You're fighting the Info War and the fight for freedom worldwide, while at the same time getting a game-changing supplement at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:51:50.114 --> 03:51:52.335]  Supermetal Vitality is now back in stock.
[03:51:52.575 --> 03:51:54.096]  It's been sold out for several months.
[03:51:54.376 --> 03:51:59.558]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:51:59.798 --> 03:52:00.799]  Brain Force is here.
[03:52:01.339 --> 03:52:03.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:52:03.880 --> 03:52:11.704]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:52:12.495 --> 03:52:15.637]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[03:52:15.917 --> 03:52:16.057]  Right?
[03:52:16.077 --> 03:52:18.419]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:52:18.779 --> 03:52:22.302]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:52:22.342 --> 03:52:25.484]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:52:25.984 --> 03:52:30.787]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:52:31.328 --> 03:52:33.149]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[03:52:33.509 --> 03:52:37.952]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:52:38.092 --> 03:52:40.094]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:52:40.714 --> 03:52:42.195]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:52:42.335 --> 03:52:42.575]  Exactly.
[03:52:42.595 --> 03:52:46.378]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:52:46.898 --> 03:52:54.883]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[03:54:05.115 --> 03:54:10.079]  Alright, final segment of the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:10.119 --> 03:54:13.502]  Now, we've got a whole hour here for the fourth hour, and I haven't plugged one time.
[03:54:13.642 --> 03:54:14.482]  So, here it is.
[03:54:14.843 --> 03:54:19.967]  Right now, Infowarsstore.com, 20% off all Alexa Pure water filtering systems.
[03:54:20.307 --> 03:54:23.170]  If you are not filtering your water right now, you're frickin' crazy.
[03:54:23.550 --> 03:54:24.731]  Okay, that's all I'm going to say.
[03:54:25.151 --> 03:54:33.016]  If you look at all the areas that have lead in their water, the fluoride, the chlorine, even the chlorine they put in to clean it is toxic to your body.
[03:54:33.336 --> 03:54:38.939]  So you are freaking crazy if you're not getting an Alexa Pure or even a Pro Pure system.
[03:54:38.959 --> 03:54:46.484]  But our Alexa Pure systems right now 20% off at Infowarsstore.com and also right now the Tim Kennedy special 15% off Supermail Vitality.
[03:54:46.504 --> 03:54:48.925]  You heard our caller from Michigan plugging Supermail Vitality.
[03:54:49.266 --> 03:54:49.846]  Brain Force
[03:54:50.106 --> 03:54:51.586]  Which I plug and I take all the time.
[03:54:51.947 --> 03:54:52.847]  And Secret 12.
[03:54:53.207 --> 03:54:55.528]  That was what I brought to Dresden.
[03:54:55.748 --> 03:55:01.269]  Gave me that extra boost of power to keep up with CIA head General Petraeus.
[03:55:01.309 --> 03:55:02.189]  Gave you the edge.
[03:55:02.390 --> 03:55:03.190]  Gave me the edge to keep up with him.
[03:55:03.210 --> 03:55:04.050]  You were wearing heavy equipment.
[03:55:04.270 --> 03:55:05.110]  I had a lot of gear.
[03:55:05.390 --> 03:55:10.752]  I had my jacket shoved in there and I was still able to keep up with him and get the question in even though he was too scared to answer it.
[03:55:11.172 --> 03:55:16.755]  So, 15% off the Supermail Vitality Brain Force and Secret 12 Special at Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:17.356 --> 03:55:19.537]  And I got two callers left, Robert and James.
[03:55:20.117 --> 03:55:21.678]  Hang on, I'm going to give you 30 seconds each.
[03:55:22.939 --> 03:55:27.781]  David, this last article, Professor rejects Marxism after traveling the globe.
[03:55:28.302 --> 03:55:33.184]  Back in the days, in the 60s, he was a big Marxist, you know, protesting the Vietnam War.
[03:55:33.264 --> 03:55:34.705]  He learned something from Bernie Sanders, didn't he?
[03:55:34.885 --> 03:55:35.326]  Exactly.
[03:55:35.386 --> 03:55:37.707]  After traveling 110 countries, he said it doesn't work.
[03:55:38.187 --> 03:55:43.829]  I was disenchanted with Marxism after visiting the countries that had tried to shape their societies to conform to its doctrines.
[03:55:44.109 --> 03:55:46.170]  I was disillusioned by the realities.
[03:55:46.630 --> 03:55:49.971]  Not the, not the, oh, it'll be a great world with robots running us.
[03:55:50.031 --> 03:55:52.512]  No, the realities is that it doesn't work, people.
[03:55:52.532 --> 03:55:53.012]  That's right.
[03:55:53.032 --> 03:55:57.354]  Even if you think it will, even if they tell you, your college professor is telling you it's going to work, it's not going to work.
[03:55:57.374 --> 03:56:01.095]  Because you're going to run out of other people's money in the end, and that is the plain, hard truth.
[03:56:01.115 --> 03:56:01.395]  David Knight.
[03:56:01.415 --> 03:56:03.015]  A utopian vision that doesn't exist.
[03:56:03.055 --> 03:56:03.156]  It is.
[03:56:03.276 --> 03:56:07.437]  And Bernie Sanders doesn't understand that, and unfortunately there's a lot of his supporters who don't understand it.
[03:56:07.577 --> 03:56:08.638]  Yeah, but they'll find out.
[03:56:08.678 --> 03:56:11.019]  And maybe if they get, they should move to one of these countries.
[03:56:11.059 --> 03:56:13.581]  James in Colorado, no-fly list yet, 30 seconds, go!
[03:56:15.382 --> 03:56:23.928]  Yeah, I just wanted to add that if you look at Obama's legislation, it says not only will the FBI be in charge of the list, but the Attorney General of the Justice Department as well.
[03:56:23.948 --> 03:56:27.890]  The whole thing started with Dianne Feinstein a week after the Paris attack.
[03:56:28.331 --> 03:56:31.393]  She said, this National Security Conference, we have to have this.
[03:56:31.953 --> 03:56:34.515]  And then the day before they voted on it, you had the San Bernardino
[03:56:36.204 --> 03:56:37.105]  I don't know what to call that.
[03:56:37.245 --> 03:56:42.349]  I think there's a lot going on there, but the point is, the whole plan, CFR's involved, and all the rest of it.
[03:56:43.049 --> 03:56:43.290]  Oh yeah.
[03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:44.150]  Exactly.
[03:56:44.370 --> 03:56:47.653]  And it's just another way to control us by not letting us travel.
[03:56:47.673 --> 03:56:52.136]  The Watch List is the worst of Orwell and Kafka and the Star Chambers that exist.
[03:56:52.196 --> 03:56:52.657]  Exactly.
[03:56:52.737 --> 03:56:54.238]  Robert in Alabama on gun control.
[03:56:54.258 --> 03:56:54.818]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:56:56.220 --> 03:57:05.427]  Well, I gotta start this out because I'm a veteran and I was in Iraq on a tour and I want to tell you about radical Islam because
[03:57:06.947 --> 03:57:10.290]  I lost some guys over there that went on a patrol, okay?
[03:57:10.810 --> 03:57:11.490]  They were killed.
[03:57:12.131 --> 03:57:18.996]  We went back later on, and there was a mosque, and I asked my interpreter, I said, what are they talking about?
[03:57:19.076 --> 03:57:24.640]  And they were talking about, we're a bunch of infidels and everything, and the mosque was trauma.
[03:57:24.680 --> 03:57:26.761]  He goes, they're preaching radical Islam.
[03:57:27.422 --> 03:57:33.026]  And my interpreter, which was an Iraqi at the time, literally told me, he said, that's radical Islam.
[03:57:33.952 --> 03:57:38.097]  We just can't get our president to say it.
[03:57:53.004 --> 03:57:53.985]  He's afraid of it.
[03:57:54.045 --> 03:57:57.987]  He wants to use radical Islam against us and it's the second generation.
[03:57:58.007 --> 03:57:58.587]  Right.
[03:57:58.607 --> 03:58:00.888]  Don't let the religion of peace get in the way of truth.
[03:58:15.376 --> 03:58:18.018]  So there you go, that's been the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:58:18.118 --> 03:58:19.079]  I was your host Rob Dew.
[03:58:19.239 --> 03:58:21.360]  Got David Knight who sat in, thanks to him.
[03:58:21.901 --> 03:58:27.584]  We put some interesting perspective on all this Orlando massacre and where it's going to take us into the future.
[03:58:27.905 --> 03:58:32.267]  One thing is for certain, you better get armed and you better learn how to use your guns before they take them away.
[03:58:32.788 --> 03:58:34.329]  I'm signing off for InfoWars.com.

[03:58:58.574 --> 03:59:06.680]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:59:06.980 --> 03:59:11.662]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[03:59:18.646 --> 03:59:25.709]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:59:25.810 --> 03:59:32.673]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:59:32.833 --> 03:59:37.198]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[04:00:05.564 --> 04:00:07.004]  We are on the march.
[04:00:07.384 --> 04:00:09.845]  The Empire is on the run.
[04:00:10.525 --> 04:00:14.286]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[04:00:22.627 --> 04:00:33.369]  Well, NATO has come out in an official policy statement and said that cyber attacks directed by Russia against any Western infrastructure
[04:00:34.574 --> 04:00:40.638]  Any computer systems will be seen as an act of war and that NATO may respond with military force.
[04:00:41.319 --> 04:00:43.380]  That is really an unprecedented statement.
[04:00:43.400 --> 04:00:44.481]  We'll be looking at that today.
[04:00:44.541 --> 04:00:54.268]  Speaking of living on the edge, Breitbart is now reporting on something that we began to expose five years ago when the Syrian conflict was started by NATO and the Clintonistas along with the Obama crew.
[04:00:54.948 --> 04:01:02.554]  Obama and men aided group that became ISIS to control area where ISIS formed its caliphate.
[04:01:03.655 --> 04:01:18.376]  And the point is is that there are now more government memos and Pentagon reports coming out Confirming everything the Pentagon told us five years ago And of course we didn't need the Pentagon to tell us we were already exposing it the Pentagon just confirmed that
