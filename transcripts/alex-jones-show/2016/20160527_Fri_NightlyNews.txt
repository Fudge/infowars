[00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:22.566]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.908]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:24.308 --> 00:00:26.031]  It is May 27th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:32.168 --> 00:00:39.053]  Tonight, a multi-year, peer-reviewed study has found a link between cell phone radiation and cancerous tumors.
[00:00:39.693 --> 00:00:45.677]  Then... I was briefed about these brave patriots fighting the government's illegal claims to their land.
[00:00:45.877 --> 00:00:49.339]  This is who your government sees as the transgressors?
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.102]  Concerned about open borders, federal agents abusing people and confiscating their land?
[00:00:54.403 --> 00:00:57.465]  You must be a hateful Nazi, like this guy.
[00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:00.747]  And a video game mimics Alex Jones.
[00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:03.769]  Portraying him as a transhuman terrorist.
[00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.610]  We will not relinquish our limbs.
[00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.951]  Do you understand?
[00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:08.472]  What's happening on this planet?
[00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:11.134]  Why are they building concentration camps?
[00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:15.196]  What's going on out there?
[00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:18.298]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:20.600]  This technology falls into the wrong hands.
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.242]  Diseases or viruses that could wipe out the human race.
[00:01:30.492 --> 00:01:33.695]  A lot of people discount their products that aren't their best sellers.
[00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:41.143]  At InfoWarsLife, I like to discount our best-selling products because that's what our listeners and viewers want.
[00:01:41.924 --> 00:01:44.306]  Super Metal Vitality has been sold out for two months.
[00:01:44.706 --> 00:01:45.627]  It's back in stock.
[00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:48.711]  It's hard to keep in stock because it's so hard to produce.
[00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:55.679]  It's 30% off for Memorial Day to honor our veterans and others that have stood up for this republic.
[00:01:55.839 --> 00:02:02.387]  It's running through three days through Monday and we've got a whole bunch of our other best sellers like Vitamin Mineral, Fusion,
[00:02:02.947 --> 00:02:03.328]  I think so.
[00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:20.364]  We're good to go.
[00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:47.664]  So for myself, Alex Jones, and the InfoWars crew here in Austin, Texas, to the U.S.
[00:02:47.724 --> 00:02:51.107]  and across the world, God bless you all, and thank you for your support.
[00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:59.353]  Humanity is awakening, and supporting causes like InfoWars are essential in taking the fight to the globalist at the next level.
[00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.533]  And we begin our news tonight with a very shocking revelation.
[00:03:06.534 --> 00:03:08.335]  Hillary Clinton is a liar.
[00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:17.023]  I know this is just something that you cannot believe to hear because they will tell you all over the media that she's just the most honest, integrity-filled
[00:03:17.763 --> 00:03:21.046]  Experienced person on the board, and I can't argue with the lady's experience.
[00:03:21.086 --> 00:03:23.868]  We can debate how good that experience was.
[00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:40.923]  But when you see Mrs. Clinton repeatedly lie and get caught, whether it was her talking about how when she stepped off the jet, I can't remember what country it was, she was dodging sniper fire, you know, she didn't know anything about Benghazi, even though she'd been receiving frequent emails and cables from Ambassador Stevens.
[00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:45.667]  Besides all that, now we have this where even MSNBC is calling her out.
[00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:50.050]  And they say, why don't Hillary's email aides tell her to stop lying?
[00:03:50.490 --> 00:04:04.380]  And the discussion came on the heels of the release of an Inspector General report this week that revealed Hillary never sought permission to have a private email server, despite claiming repeatedly that the State Department had knowledge of her use of the private server.
[00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:09.403]  So yeah, I'm sure this shocks you and you just don't know what to do with yourself.
[00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:12.826]  But let's take a look at MSNBC themselves debating this issue.
[00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:14.938]  That was mind-boggling.
[00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.143]  The number of false statements contained within that... Amazing.
[00:04:19.283 --> 00:04:21.505]  I mean, I don't want to be, like, negative.
[00:04:21.646 --> 00:04:22.286]  I really don't.
[00:04:22.507 --> 00:04:26.291]  Does she not have anybody around her that can tell her Jim Van Dyke?
[00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:31.396]  You know, we gotta really stop lying about this.
[00:04:31.516 --> 00:04:33.739]  Because everything she said in there was just a lie.
[00:04:34.352 --> 00:04:36.495]  I mean it was it was allowed by the State Department.
[00:04:36.555 --> 00:04:39.639]  No, it was not allowed by the State Department.
[00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.182]  Everybody knew in the State Department that we were doing it.
[00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:49.452]  And one of the more encouraging things about this revelation, I guess just the Hillary experience in general, is when we went out to
[00:04:50.353 --> 00:04:52.074]  Albuquerque and later on to Anaheim.
[00:04:52.154 --> 00:04:56.475]  I was very encouraged to meet very few Hillary Clinton supporters.
[00:04:56.495 --> 00:05:01.816]  We met many Bernie supporters, people who were just not going to vote at all, libertarians, anarchists.
[00:05:02.497 --> 00:05:05.798]  But regardless, people are waking up to her, even on the left.
[00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:07.258]  So I'm very encouraged to see this.
[00:05:07.518 --> 00:05:09.779]  People saying this woman is a liar, she cannot be trusted.
[00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:16.201]  And that's not to say that the other political contenders are any better, but she has her issues and at least people recognize that.
[00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:17.321]  So I think we are
[00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:22.503]  One step closer to a utopia planet, even though that's a bit far away.
[00:05:22.824 --> 00:05:23.924]  Let's talk about some other news.
[00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:28.847]  Global elite ignored dire warning at G7 about economic collapse.
[00:05:29.447 --> 00:05:34.830]  And on Thursday, leaders at the G7 in Japan ignored a dire warning issued by the Prime Minister.
[00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:45.062]  The collapse in bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008, at the time the fourth largest US investment bank, was a seminal event of the subprime financial crisis.
[00:05:45.443 --> 00:05:52.692]  Its implosion resulted in the loss of more than $10 trillion in market capitalization from global equity markets.
[00:05:53.012 --> 00:05:54.053]  And this is what the movie
[00:05:54.594 --> 00:05:56.375]  The Big Short is loosely based upon.
[00:05:56.655 --> 00:06:01.397]  Every time I talk about a movie, somebody wants to tell me, like, that was the most historically accurate movie ever made.
[00:06:01.777 --> 00:06:02.477]  I understand that.
[00:06:02.858 --> 00:06:06.079]  Same way if I talk about the Abraham Lincoln movie or Charlie Wilson's war.
[00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.101]  I'm just saying that sometimes those things reference real events.
[00:06:10.141 --> 00:06:12.122]  I'm not saying that the best thing ever made.
[00:06:12.142 --> 00:06:15.623]  I had a conversation with a lady about that when we were out in Albuquerque.
[00:06:16.163 --> 00:06:18.864]  She was trying to tell me about Abraham Lincoln and how great he was.
[00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:20.805]  I said, what about how Abraham Lincoln
[00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:27.311]  Locked up his political opposition, not people who raped or murdered people, but just people in other parties from him.
[00:06:27.692 --> 00:06:29.554]  And then she just, she didn't know what to say to that.
[00:06:29.574 --> 00:06:33.819]  She just had her one talking point that he was so great and awesome, and she had no retort to that.
[00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:36.241]  But anyway, that's neither here nor there.
[00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:38.444]  We'll talk about entertainment more in just one second.
[00:06:38.784 --> 00:06:40.226]  But first, let's talk about your health.
[00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:43.868]  And there has been a leak between cell phones and cancer.
[00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:50.973]  And this is something we've heard for a long time, or at least has been speculated for a long time, but now this appears to be backed up by a study.
[00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:57.337]  The multi-year peer-reviewed study by the National Toxicology Program found low incidences
[00:06:57.757 --> 00:07:04.218]  Of two types of tumors in male rats that were exposed to the type of radio frequencies that are commonly emitted by cell phones.
[00:07:04.678 --> 00:07:08.179]  A spokesperson for the group was not immediately available to comment.
[00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:10.199]  So this is stuff that we hear.
[00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:16.360]  I think it was a month or so ago I saw some report about how cell phones can damage sperm counts and things like that.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:25.022]  So I understand that cell phones are a part of modern life, but if you can distance yourself from them, I hear even using things like Bluetooth or talking over
[00:07:25.462 --> 00:07:30.787]  A car stereo is somewhat useful and beneficial as opposed to just holding it to your head.
[00:07:30.807 --> 00:07:34.650]  Let's talk a little bit about entertainment as I teased earlier.
[00:07:35.111 --> 00:07:42.558]  Now, the thing with entertainment is I run into people, they'll see some report I did like the report I did on Rainbow Six Patriots a few years ago.
[00:07:42.978 --> 00:07:43.258]  I don't
[00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:04.542]  I just didn't like this particular aspect of it.
[00:08:04.582 --> 00:08:15.316]  You know, case in point, let's say you go to Chick-fil-A, and you know, you love the food, you love the lemonade, you love whatever else, but then you see some report that the food babe did and say, hey, Chick-fil-A has this ingredient in their food that I don't think is so great.
[00:08:16.057 --> 00:08:20.223]  People sign a petition, Chick-fil-A removes the ingredients, and then you go back to Chick-fil-A and everybody's happy.
[00:08:20.563 --> 00:08:22.364]  That's the same way I talk about entertainment.
[00:08:22.384 --> 00:08:24.604]  I'm not talking for boycotts or anything like that.
[00:08:24.925 --> 00:08:27.285]  If you choose to boycott, that may be other people's opinions.
[00:08:27.346 --> 00:08:27.946]  That's fine.
[00:08:28.286 --> 00:08:31.707]  I'm just saying if they could change up one or two things, I would like the product more.
[00:08:32.047 --> 00:08:32.767]  That's me personally.
[00:08:33.168 --> 00:08:34.068]  Now let's talk about this.
[00:08:34.888 --> 00:08:38.970]  The Red Skull is now seemingly teaming up with a bunch of
[00:08:40.276 --> 00:08:44.537]  I guess radical extremists as far as Americans are concerned.
[00:08:44.897 --> 00:08:48.397]  And he's talking about the situation when it comes to migrants.
[00:08:48.858 --> 00:09:00.340]  And he's saying basically, you know, these refugees are flooding our countries and, you know, hurting our women and, you know, stealing our jobs and all the usual, you know, super right wing talking points.
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.201]  And I have this conversation quite often with people when I talk about things like immigration.
[00:09:05.601 --> 00:09:07.201]  I say all the time, I have no issue with
[00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:08.561]  We're good to go.
[00:09:28.292 --> 00:09:34.778]  I had to have a visa, TSA or whatever their equivalent of it, was checking my bags and patting me down and all this stuff.
[00:09:35.098 --> 00:09:37.080]  And I get to the front of the line, they say, why are you here?
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.921]  I want to see your passport.
[00:09:38.181 --> 00:09:39.162]  I don't have my passport.
[00:09:39.222 --> 00:09:40.983]  Go to the back of the line until you find your passport.
[00:09:41.243 --> 00:09:42.364]  Get back up to the front of the line.
[00:09:42.384 --> 00:09:45.747]  Mr. Jackson, we don't know why you're here, where you're going, how long you'll be staying here.
[00:09:46.408 --> 00:09:48.109]  You know, do you have any contacts in the country?
[00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.853]  All these things I had to go through to enter their country temporarily.
[00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:55.236]  And people say, like, it's just an American thing that people get checked and aborted.
[00:09:55.276 --> 00:09:58.819]  No, they do that all over the world if they have the money to afford it.
[00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:02.882]  With that said, I had to legally enter their country.
[00:10:03.163 --> 00:10:10.209]  Had I just walked out the airport and down the street without going through customs, I would have committed a crime even though I'm an American citizen with no criminal record.
[00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:12.010]  That's the point I'm making to you.
[00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.471]  I'm not saying everybody who comes into the country is a criminal.
[00:10:15.491 --> 00:10:20.253]  I'm not saying everybody's a cartel member or a, you know, member of ISIS.
[00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:22.875]  I'm saying you have to enter the country through a legal way.
[00:10:23.195 --> 00:10:25.436]  And that's what oftentimes gets misconstrued.
[00:10:25.776 --> 00:10:27.177]  Like we went out to the Albuquerque rally.
[00:10:27.197 --> 00:10:29.538]  I know I keep referencing that, but that's just something that just happened recently.
[00:10:29.558 --> 00:10:33.700]  They're like, Trump said everybody's, you know, racist and Mexican and they're killing everybody.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.040]  I'm like,
[00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:35.791]  I can't speak for Trump.
[00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:36.692]  I'm speaking for me.
[00:10:36.812 --> 00:10:41.017]  I'm saying you have to legally enter the country, otherwise you illegally enter the country.
[00:10:41.317 --> 00:10:42.098]  It's as simple as that.
[00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:45.001]  And now they're using the red skull to put this stuff out there.
[00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:47.224]  So once again, I'm not calling for anybody to boycott Marvel.
[00:10:47.624 --> 00:10:50.107]  I just wish Marvel would take a different approach.
[00:10:50.147 --> 00:10:52.149]  But at the end of the day, I believe in free speech.
[00:10:52.189 --> 00:10:54.111]  They can write anything that they want.
[00:10:55.106 --> 00:10:55.847]  In their comic books.
[00:10:56.527 --> 00:10:59.309]  And we'll transition from the comic books into video games.
[00:10:59.749 --> 00:11:13.057]  Now, we've seen various portrayals of Alex Jones in media, whether it's on X-Files, or I can't remember the comedian's name, he did Arrested Development, and he has the guy yelling, you know, these racist, you know, n-words in the White House, and I heard it on Alex Jones because it's true.
[00:11:14.398 --> 00:11:15.858]  That guy has never said that.
[00:11:16.158 --> 00:11:23.860]  And a lot of people, when I run into people who say Alex is racist, they'll oftentimes point me to the clip of Alex Jones wearing the Obama mask and they'll say that's like blackface or something.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:36.763]  If you guys go back and you Google Alex Jones, belly of the beast, you can see a clip of him and Joe Rogan dressing up like the Bush family and calling them devil worshippers, long before the majority of the people in the country ever knew who Barack Hussein Obama was.
[00:11:36.803 --> 00:11:41.284]  So if you want to call him out for that, you also got to take into account that he was making fun of the Bushes a long time ago.
[00:11:41.744 --> 00:11:45.427]  That goes against their narrative and thus they will never put that out there in the media.
[00:11:45.768 --> 00:11:50.732]  And now we see this Alex Jones depicted as a transhuman terrorist in a new video game.
[00:11:51.866 --> 00:11:55.208]  Alex Jones here during a three-minute break on Facebook Mentions.
[00:11:55.228 --> 00:11:56.429]  We're also going to upload this to YouTube.
[00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:59.910]  We've got Tim Kennedy right here of UFC fame.
[00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.231]  Really special ops fame over here.
[00:12:01.291 --> 00:12:02.412]  This guy's like Chris Collins.
[00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:03.713]  Well, he's wild.
[00:12:04.353 --> 00:12:05.033]  Here working with us.
[00:12:05.293 --> 00:12:09.276]  Tim, I'm very excited that the near future we're going to be announcing some collaboration together.
[00:12:09.436 --> 00:12:10.176]  Yeah, it's going to be fun.
[00:12:10.616 --> 00:12:11.557]  You've got so many websites.
[00:12:11.577 --> 00:12:12.918]  What's the best website for folks to check out?
[00:12:13.818 --> 00:12:16.099]  Sheepdogresponse.com or TimKennedyMMA.
[00:12:16.259 --> 00:12:17.600]  I mean, that's where you're going to find me.
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.841]  Everything else is social media.
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.143]  At 2 o'clock today, in about 30 minutes, we're going to do another 10-minute Facebook Mentions or so.
[00:12:24.163 --> 00:12:25.284]  You going to have time?
[00:12:25.304 --> 00:12:25.444]  Yeah.
[00:12:25.464 --> 00:12:25.765]  Fantastic.
[00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:26.085]  Awesome.
[00:12:26.405 --> 00:12:27.746]  So I'm just letting you folks know that's coming up.
[00:12:27.846 --> 00:12:32.249]  But the main reason I'm doing this quick 3-minute video is I got sent this a few days ago.
[00:12:32.349 --> 00:12:33.430]  I kind of forgot about it.
[00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.492]  There's the article on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:35.912 --> 00:12:41.036]  Alex Jones depicted as transhuman terrorist in new video game.
[00:12:41.932 --> 00:12:50.235]  And it's literally my speech from CNN, you know, Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, and then I say, if you don't do what we say, we're going to kill you, and then truck bombs go up.
[00:12:50.556 --> 00:12:53.257]  So here we are trying to stop ISIS and Al-Qaeda coming into the country.
[00:12:53.517 --> 00:12:55.017]  Here we are trying to stop terrorism.
[00:12:55.197 --> 00:12:57.298]  Here we are trying to stop Black Lives Matter, kill the cops.
[00:12:57.498 --> 00:13:03.501]  Here I am calling for non-violence and restore our republic, and it's another game implying that I'm for terrorism.
[00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:09.223]  Now, they could claim that in the future it's transhumanists who've been augmented, who fight back against oppression.
[00:13:09.443 --> 00:13:11.184]  So maybe the makers think they're doing me a favor.
[00:13:11.744 --> 00:13:19.986]  All I know is it's bizarre, it's weird, and I'm going to be playing that clip here on Facebook Mentions in about 30 minutes when we finish it.
[00:13:20.006 --> 00:13:23.006]  So tell us what you think on the article at InfoWars.com.
[00:13:23.286 --> 00:13:26.147]  Alex Jones depicted as transhumanist terrorist in new video game.
[00:13:26.467 --> 00:13:27.287]  It is crazy.
[00:13:27.567 --> 00:13:30.688]  All right, we're going to go ahead and go live here in about 30 seconds.
[00:13:30.728 --> 00:13:33.768]  But first off, Tim Kennedy, this is unscripted.
[00:13:34.248 --> 00:13:37.889]  What is front and center with all the news you're covering, all the things you're doing right now?
[00:13:38.749 --> 00:13:39.509]  I think it's preparation.
[00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:40.350]  I think it's training.
[00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.931]  It's giving people the opportunity to live and exercise their freedoms.
[00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:48.492]  If you don't exercise your freedoms like a muscle, atrophy occurs.
[00:13:48.592 --> 00:13:49.432]  They shrink and they die.
[00:13:49.932 --> 00:13:51.133]  And that's what's happening to our freedoms.
[00:13:51.173 --> 00:13:54.234]  We're just letting them dissolve, we're letting them rot, and we're letting them decay.
[00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:55.434]  And I'm over it.
[00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:58.735]  So, me and my friends and everybody that I know, anybody that I have influence of,
[00:14:00.096 --> 00:14:03.577]  We're doing exactly what every American should be doing, and that is exercising our freedoms.
[00:14:03.937 --> 00:14:07.518]  And in closing, in exciting news, when are we going to hear the big UFC announcement?
[00:14:08.538 --> 00:14:12.699]  I have to wait to say what it is until the UFC says it, but it's big.
[00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.779]  How long do we hear from them, probably?
[00:14:14.859 --> 00:14:15.699]  A month?
[00:14:15.719 --> 00:14:16.420]  A month, maybe?
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:16.760]  Alright.
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.120]  Folks, that's it.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.480]  We'll be back in about 30 minutes.
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.061]  We're live right now at fullwords.com forward slash show.
[00:14:22.081 --> 00:14:22.541]  Come join us.
[00:14:23.601 --> 00:14:24.601]  And now we have this.
[00:14:24.622 --> 00:14:28.543]  96-year-old Heimlich uses namesake maneuver on choking women.
[00:14:28.563 --> 00:14:30.504]  So basically you guys heard of the Heimlich maneuver.
[00:14:31.105 --> 00:14:35.807]  The man who invented the technique was in a living center and he helped a woman who was choking on a hamburger.
[00:14:35.907 --> 00:14:38.088]  So it all came full circle.
[00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:42.710]  He said in a quote that he was very happy that his maneuver saved so many people over the years.
[00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.491]  You do have to be careful when you do it though.
[00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:45.851]  You can break somebody's ribs.
[00:14:45.892 --> 00:14:48.633]  I took a Red Cross class about that.
[00:14:49.133 --> 00:14:53.076]  But, you know, you still help people with it, so good for you, 96-year-old Dr. Heimlich.
[00:14:53.416 --> 00:14:58.120]  Let's talk about somebody who's not doing good things, and this is the jihadi bride, Sally Jones.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:11.290]  And basically, Paul Joseph Watson is pointing out the hypocrisy of these social media sites, how they will come down so harshly on various types of conservatives, or, you know, if you have a gun post on Facebook, they want to list it like it's porn.
[00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:25.376]  But we see ISIS jihadist allowed to spew hate on Twitter for six months without being banned, and she is also known as Mrs. Terror, and she is back in the news again after threatening ISIS attacks in London, Glasgow, and other UK cities this summer.
[00:15:25.876 --> 00:15:30.638]  And she said, to be honest, I wouldn't go into central London through June, or even July.
[00:15:30.718 --> 00:15:40.422]  Well, to be honest, I wouldn't go there, especially by tube, tweeted Jones, and this is Sally Jones, following another tweet that simply read, England, arrow, boom.
[00:15:41.562 --> 00:15:42.103]  So there you go.
[00:15:42.543 --> 00:15:44.524]  People can get on there, threaten people's lives.
[00:15:44.544 --> 00:15:48.087]  They can talk about a conservative political contender.
[00:15:48.107 --> 00:15:55.613]  But if you say something about the liberal political contenders, they want to shut you down, have cops show up to your house, all types of manner of other things.
[00:15:55.693 --> 00:16:00.657]  But if you're calling for a violent revolution against people, that's perfectly fine.
[00:16:00.697 --> 00:16:01.938]  That's liberal and trendy.
[00:16:02.298 --> 00:16:06.782]  And that's how they continue to operate on these social media ghettos, as Matt Drudge calls them.
[00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:10.064]  So to an extent, I do view them as a
[00:16:11.465 --> 00:16:16.630]  I can bet the term necessary evil, but if you can exist without Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, whatever, more power to you.
[00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.271]  Good job on that.
[00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:35.225]  Now, once again, to reference the situation we saw in Albuquerque this week, myself and Michael Zimmerman when we were out there, there was some guy out there in one of our videos, he had a free El Chapo shirt, and he was talking about how El Chapo was so great and he hated Trump and all that.
[00:16:35.666 --> 00:16:37.527]  But the thing I was thinking about when I was looking at this guy,
[00:16:38.428 --> 00:16:48.334]  It's how often these drug kingpins or whoever, they turn against their underlings, for lack of a better term, in order to get time off their sentences.
[00:16:48.394 --> 00:16:51.516]  And now actually the underlings are turning against El Chapo.
[00:16:51.956 --> 00:16:57.599]  And now we see El Chapo's captured rivals and Spurn lieutenants are lining up to testify against him.
[00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:01.721]  And this is according to documents obtained by EFE News.
[00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:03.703]  Former Sinaloa lieutenants
[00:17:04.483 --> 00:17:07.264]  They also talked about how La Barbie, I don't know if you guys are familiar with her.
[00:17:07.284 --> 00:17:10.045]  She got the name because she's just so beautiful and I guess they said she looks like a Barbie doll.
[00:17:10.065 --> 00:17:10.165]  She's
[00:17:33.772 --> 00:17:36.874]  Has a possibility to testify against him in order to get time off.
[00:17:36.894 --> 00:17:44.258]  So it just shows there is no honor among thieves, whether you see the gangster movies where everybody kills each other, everybody snitches on each other.
[00:17:44.278 --> 00:17:45.959]  It usually doesn't end well.
[00:17:46.319 --> 00:17:48.721]  They say if you live that type of lifestyle, you end up dead or in jail.
[00:17:48.761 --> 00:17:52.083]  And that's exactly what's going to happen to the majority of people I just talked about here.
[00:17:52.563 --> 00:17:53.724]  And we'll end tonight on this.
[00:17:53.744 --> 00:17:56.686]  I do a lot of human trafficking stories and talk to people.
[00:17:57.006 --> 00:18:01.829]  And one of the questions I usually ask the person, whether they be a college professor or activist or whoever,
[00:18:02.529 --> 00:18:06.854]  Do you think if we legalize prostitution, a lot of the human trafficking issues will go away?
[00:18:06.914 --> 00:18:10.357]  And when I say legalize, I'm talking about consenting adults of age.
[00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:11.358]  And they say...
[00:18:12.526 --> 00:18:16.387]  The majority of them, that they don't think the problem will go away if you legalize prostitution.
[00:18:16.767 --> 00:18:20.868]  And now we see this, World Human Rights Group publishes policy to legalize prostitution.
[00:18:21.248 --> 00:18:25.929]  And this is Amnesty International basically saying that it may help if you legalize prostitution.
[00:18:25.949 --> 00:18:29.610]  So, and I've heard libertarian arguments for legalizing prostitution.
[00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.610]  Deitch is on.
[00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:34.591]  I'd like to hear your arguments whether prostitution should be legal or illegal.
[00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:37.012]  Stay tuned after this for more special reports.
[00:19:04.906 --> 00:19:09.330]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.072]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:15.769]  And to look at that threat, we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:27.192]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type one civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.852 --> 00:19:39.214]  You can say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.742 --> 00:19:50.145]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:53.818]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2, Survival Shield, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:54.138 --> 00:22:56.521]  Again, that's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:23:04.253 --> 00:23:13.701]  I will read the questions off to you, and we have a typist here that is going to go ahead and type them into the box as you answer them.
[00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:18.965]  So, just to start off, is there anything that you'd like to tell the people of Reddit?
[00:23:20.046 --> 00:23:21.867]  Well, first of all, I'm delighted to be here.
[00:23:22.488 --> 00:23:28.993]  Secondarily, no question is off limits tonight, although I reserve the right
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.182]  Not to answer some questions, of course.
[00:23:31.422 --> 00:23:42.513]  I am assuming right off the bat that the MoveOn.org crowd and the Black Lives Matter crowd and the David Brock Media Matters crowd have already infiltrated our audience.
[00:23:43.274 --> 00:23:43.975]  But that's fine.
[00:23:44.035 --> 00:23:45.176]  I will take all comers.
[00:23:46.277 --> 00:23:49.240]  And I'm prepared to talk about Trump.
[00:23:49.798 --> 00:23:57.426]  About politics, about my books, about men's style, a little fashion advice, whatever folks want to talk about.
[00:23:57.446 --> 00:23:58.507]  I'm just delighted to be here.
[00:23:58.807 --> 00:24:08.036]  Roger, on your Wikipedia page, you were quoted as saying, in the first grade, I remember going through the cafeteria line and telling every kid that Nixon was in favor of school on Saturdays.
[00:24:08.437 --> 00:24:10.018]  It was my first political trick.
[00:24:10.539 --> 00:24:12.481]  What other political tricks have you pulled?
[00:24:13.291 --> 00:24:18.836]  Well, the reason that trick is important is because my elementary school was having a mock election.
[00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:20.898]  Kennedy versus Nixon.
[00:24:21.318 --> 00:24:28.424]  I was, for some reason, I was in favor of John Kennedy because I thought he had better hair than Nixon.
[00:24:30.246 --> 00:24:33.408]  Uh, and my parents were Catholics, although they were Republicans.
[00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:37.411]  Uh, and, uh, they were, uh, they kind of liked Jack Kennedy.
[00:24:37.792 --> 00:24:41.114]  There was a real pull there, I think, although I believe they voted for Nixon.
[00:24:41.555 --> 00:24:47.560]  In any event, uh, I learned the value of disinformation from a strategic, uh, point of view.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:56.027]  Uh, but let me say politics is not beanbag, uh, and, uh, every political leader, uh, and political,
[00:24:57.088 --> 00:25:06.838]  A successful elected official has used subterfuge and artifice, certainly Bill Clinton, Franklin Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, all of them.
[00:25:07.519 --> 00:25:13.185]  The problem is that in the old days when we had a limited media oversight
[00:25:14.113 --> 00:25:18.115]  And we only had three networks and a couple national newspapers.
[00:25:18.655 --> 00:25:26.860]  Essentially, I think the establishment, be it the government or establishment media, conspired to control a certain narrative.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.401]  After all, we can't tell the people the truth.
[00:25:30.802 --> 00:25:31.242]  Panic.
[00:25:31.343 --> 00:25:44.674]  So for their own good today, of course, with the rise of the Internet and talk radio and cable television, information can no longer be suppressed.
[00:25:45.155 --> 00:25:56.464]  And that's why it's important to look back at a number of historical milestones, whether it is 9-11 or whether it is the Iraq war, whether it is the Kennedy assassination.
[00:25:57.345 --> 00:26:03.292]  With fresh eyes and with an independent alternative media.
[00:26:03.632 --> 00:26:13.363]  One of the biggest benefits to a Trump-Bernie debate would be how small, cowardly and protected it'd make Crooked Hillary look for backing out of her final Fox News debate against Sanders.
[00:26:13.403 --> 00:26:15.906]  Do you think the risks of this debate would be worth the reward?
[00:26:16.066 --> 00:26:18.469]  And if so, could you place odds on the outcome?
[00:26:19.497 --> 00:26:29.287]  No, I would oppose this debate because strategically, actually, I believe what Trump ought to be doing is to stress those issues that he shares with Bernie.
[00:26:29.808 --> 00:26:31.189]  They both oppose the war.
[00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:33.132]  They both oppose NAFTA.
[00:26:33.432 --> 00:26:35.934]  They're both opposed to TPP and TPA.
[00:26:36.475 --> 00:26:38.697]  They both oppose the globalist
[00:26:39.358 --> 00:26:44.761]  Trade deals that have, as Ross Perot famously said, sucked the jobs out of America.
[00:26:45.222 --> 00:26:57.870]  So going into a debate with Bernie, you would end up talking about foreign policy where he's a peacenik and Trump is, I would say, a non-interventionist, not a neocon, certainly not an isolationist.
[00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.952]  But I think you want to be looking for things that you have in common.
[00:27:02.012 --> 00:27:02.893]  Now, I don't think
[00:27:03.533 --> 00:27:03.653]  That's
[00:27:18.983 --> 00:27:21.885]  Uh, our right territory for Donald Trump.
[00:27:22.626 --> 00:27:26.589]  I think he should go out of his way not to alienate Bernie or his supporters.
[00:27:26.929 --> 00:27:30.531]  So here's a pretty interesting question from Triggly Puffs herself.
[00:27:30.651 --> 00:27:31.292]  Ha ha ha.
[00:27:31.832 --> 00:27:39.218]  What is your opinion on the Holder Justice Department's failure to investigate and prosecute Wall Street fraud in the lead up to the financial crisis?
[00:27:39.938 --> 00:27:46.842]  The Wall Street crooks, the insiders, are insulated because they have political pull and they have money.
[00:27:47.523 --> 00:27:50.965]  This is the most corrupt Justice Department in American history.
[00:27:51.665 --> 00:27:54.147]  Eric Holder makes John Mitchell look like St.
[00:27:54.207 --> 00:27:55.228]  Thomas Aquinas.
[00:27:56.468 --> 00:27:56.568]  Huh.
[00:28:12.611 --> 00:28:20.354]  General David Petraeus' career was destroyed for a much lesser transgression involving classified documents.
[00:28:21.714 --> 00:28:29.978]  That's before we even get to the Clinton Foundation, which is the largest money laundering fraud in U.S.
[00:28:30.018 --> 00:28:30.498]  history.
[00:28:31.078 --> 00:28:35.760]  It is a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scam.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.301]  It is not a charity.
[00:28:38.821 --> 00:28:41.342]  It's a slush fund for grifters.
[00:28:42.362 --> 00:28:47.024]  It is the vehicle for the facilitation of multi-million dollar bribes.
[00:28:47.544 --> 00:28:50.905]  Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton would steal a hot stove.
[00:28:51.765 --> 00:28:56.307]  And I think this whole area is going to be one of enormous vulnerability.
[00:28:56.607 --> 00:28:59.087]  You can sum this issue up in one word.
[00:28:59.748 --> 00:29:00.248]  Greed.
[00:29:00.508 --> 00:29:03.329]  What role, if any, would you play in a Donald Trump administration?
[00:29:04.953 --> 00:29:05.854]  None whatsoever.
[00:29:05.934 --> 00:29:09.057]  First of all, I doubt that I could be confirmed by the U.S.
[00:29:09.077 --> 00:29:09.417]  Senate.
[00:29:10.458 --> 00:29:12.600]  I have lived a very colorful life.
[00:29:13.061 --> 00:29:14.302]  I make no bones about it.
[00:29:15.103 --> 00:29:24.451]  I think it is interesting that when I published the Clinton's War on Women, the result has been a mountain of personal vilification attacking me.
[00:29:27.071 --> 00:29:28.432]  I'm not running for president.
[00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:34.878]  Chris Cuomo says to Donald Trump, you are attacking Hillary for the indiscretions of her husband.
[00:29:35.418 --> 00:29:37.159]  This is not about indiscretions.
[00:29:37.239 --> 00:29:39.321]  It's not about consensual sex.
[00:29:39.882 --> 00:29:41.163]  It's not about adultery.
[00:29:41.683 --> 00:29:44.465]  It's not about marital infidelity.
[00:29:44.866 --> 00:29:47.848]  It's not about girlfriends or mistresses or one night stands.
[00:29:48.629 --> 00:29:51.071]  It's about sexual assault and rape.
[00:29:52.449 --> 00:29:58.472]  The number of women who have accused Bill Clinton is staggering and they are entirely believable.
[00:29:58.892 --> 00:30:02.594]  They have not been paid by anyone to bear false witness against Bill.
[00:30:03.115 --> 00:30:05.996]  But that's part of the strategy, attack the women.
[00:30:07.857 --> 00:30:16.582]  The difference between Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton is that Bill Cosby drugged his victims, where Bill Clinton physically overpowered his and bit them.
[00:30:17.722 --> 00:30:18.903]  That is the sad truth.
[00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:20.285]  Bill Clinton is a predator.
[00:30:21.145 --> 00:30:24.288]  And the mainstream media doesn't want to go there with that narrative.
[00:30:24.328 --> 00:30:28.752]  They want to redefine this as being about consensual sex.
[00:30:28.772 --> 00:30:31.634]  Well, I'd rather see Ron Paul be the head of the Fed.
[00:30:39.243 --> 00:30:40.624]  That would be my first pick.
[00:30:41.705 --> 00:30:48.491]  But, you know, Donald Trump has a healthy respect for Ron Paul, based on his own statements.
[00:30:49.351 --> 00:30:53.935]  He did once make the argument at a CPAC conference that Ron could not win.
[00:30:53.975 --> 00:30:55.516]  He turned out to be right about that.
[00:30:55.637 --> 00:30:59.179]  But in many ways, Trump has come out in favor of the
[00:31:00.483 --> 00:31:00.684]  I think?
[00:31:16.271 --> 00:31:17.252]  Does brain force really work?
[00:31:34.905 --> 00:31:43.832]  It became very clear after a huge number of tests that there was very little that Western medicine could do for me other than weight.
[00:31:44.752 --> 00:31:57.862]  Therefore, I began pursuing alternative medicines like acupuncture, like Chinese herbology, like natural supplements to see how they affected both my mental and physical performance.
[00:31:58.682 --> 00:32:07.224]  Uh, and, uh, they, I think, uh, improve my athletic performance, uh, and they improve my balance, uh, and they improve my energy.
[00:32:07.344 --> 00:32:17.086]  So, yes, I think, uh, that many of the products that I have used, that I have gotten, uh, at InfoWars and other places, uh, have, uh, have worked.
[00:32:17.106 --> 00:32:23.887]  Others I've been less satisfied with, but as far as BrainForce is concerned, I've got so many things on my mind right now, it's quite helpful.
[00:32:24.227 --> 00:32:33.691]  How do you think the, quote, protesters are affecting the perception of Trump throughout the greater minds of the United States?
[00:32:34.172 --> 00:32:38.073]  I think that this is helping galvanize votes for Trump.
[00:32:38.113 --> 00:32:41.475]  I think this helps motivate people to register to vote for Trump.
[00:32:41.615 --> 00:32:43.376]  This is a polarizing election.
[00:32:44.416 --> 00:32:47.558]  And this effort to abridge the First Amendment rights
[00:32:48.218 --> 00:32:49.640]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.

[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:30.494]  Now it's finally here.
[00:34:30.954 --> 00:34:34.455]  AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:35.255]  It's easy.

[00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:53.400]  You add to that free shipping on orders of $50, it is a can't lose.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:11.482 --> 00:37:12.803]  Welcome to the B.S.
[00:37:12.903 --> 00:37:18.747]  Club, hosted by the United Kingdom's New World Order-backed propaganda machine, The Guardian.
[00:37:19.027 --> 00:37:27.794]  Apparently, The Guardian didn't have any problem rolling out the following baseless drivel to its readers-slash-YouTube viewers.
[00:37:28.214 --> 00:37:30.336]  Of course, commenting on the U.S.
[00:37:30.476 --> 00:37:37.781]  presidential election whilst ignoring the massive problems in your own country is a sketchy undertaking to begin with.
[00:37:38.021 --> 00:37:55.173]  But when your publication is run by an elitist New World Order lackey like Dame Liz Forgan, the Dame being her high masonic title allowing Forgan to rub elbows with royalty, media oligarchs, and the Lord Rothschild, you do as expected.
[00:37:55.433 --> 00:38:05.601]  Here is what the Telegraph had to say about Dame Liz in 2013 before she became the chair of Scott Trust Limited, the British company that owns the Guardian Media Group.
[00:38:05.821 --> 00:38:10.505]  The Telegraph writes, Why not spend £8,000 on a leaving due?
[00:38:10.765 --> 00:38:12.587]  A party held when leaving a job.
[00:38:12.887 --> 00:38:15.968]  That's what Dame Liz and her cast are entitled to.
[00:38:16.248 --> 00:38:18.989]  That's what the little people are there to pay for.
[00:38:19.009 --> 00:38:30.414]  There could be no clearer demonstration of the contempt that Dame Liz, who exudes the haughty sense of self-worth and entitlement that typifies the arts establishment, has for the rest of us.
[00:38:30.754 --> 00:38:41.381]  That she chose a drinks party funded by the taxpayer to attack the government for cutting the arts budget, contempt, and a jaw-dropping lack of self-awareness.
[00:38:41.781 --> 00:39:00.574]  So, without further ado, here is the Guardian's Stephen Thrasher looking forward to the day when America's dying white majority is overthrown and a political revolution led by people of color ends the white supremacist system currently represented by Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
[00:39:00.834 --> 00:39:10.418]  When we had a clear symbol that the country is literally becoming more black, why shouldn't we have expected its successor to be the meanest, whitest, most vile bigot possible?
[00:39:10.638 --> 00:39:18.881]  And when protesters demanded that Black Lives Matter, why shouldn't we have anticipated the rise of a candidate who encourages violence against peaceful demonstrators?
[00:39:20.506 --> 00:39:22.887]  A President Trump would fit right into American history.
[00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:28.009]  I'm waiting for the year 2043, when this white supremacist nation becomes mostly non-white.
[00:39:28.529 --> 00:39:30.970]  That's when true political revolution might be possible.
[00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:46.856]  Thrasher, you work for the so-called dying white majority, completely ignoring that Europe and now the United States are quietly being invaded by Sharia law zealots hell-bent on throwing people of Thrasher's persuasion off of rooftops.
[00:39:47.136 --> 00:39:53.580]  Not to be outdone in the threat-laced propaganda lecturing is Guardian columnist Jonathan Friedland.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.101]  The world is watching.
[00:39:55.221 --> 00:39:56.702]  Then the world was inspired.
[00:39:57.162 --> 00:39:58.383]  Now we're scared.
[00:39:58.603 --> 00:40:00.404]  You won't rule out dropping a nuclear bomb.
[00:40:00.804 --> 00:40:04.306]  On Europe, Islamophobia would be a matter of state policy.
[00:40:04.446 --> 00:40:09.349]  If you're Mexican, you'll know that the American president thinks you're basically a criminal or a rapist.
[00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:13.092]  There'll be a surge of what people will call anti-Americanism.
[00:40:13.672 --> 00:40:16.953]  People will mock the nation as dumb, vulgar and aggressive.
[00:40:17.373 --> 00:40:21.515]  It'll be like it was in the George W. Bush years, only much, much worse.
[00:40:21.895 --> 00:40:29.477]  Friedland, your smug elitist arrogance and weak threats are just as bad as your flaccid declaration of anti-Americanism.
[00:40:29.697 --> 00:40:36.560]  Your sycophantic jabbering makes me wonder when you're due back in the City of London for your umpteenth microchipping.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:43.062]  And here is yet another Guardian columnist, Gary Young, to lecture us on our democracy in crisis.
[00:40:43.522 --> 00:40:49.464]  Claiming Americans are blaming the refugees solely for the soft invasion of Europe and the United States.
[00:40:49.924 --> 00:40:54.485]  An invasion engineered by the very globalists signing Young's paychecks.
[00:40:54.945 --> 00:40:59.167]  His assent is part of a rise in right-wing populism throughout the Western world.
[00:40:59.327 --> 00:41:01.788]  Most Western nations have their own Trump.
[00:41:02.348 --> 00:41:09.550]  A racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic demagogue appealing to a mix of nationalist nostalgia, patriotic myth,
[00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.611]  Class grievance and economic insecurity.
[00:41:12.951 --> 00:41:15.871]  Now, liberal commentators describe them as a threat to democracy.
[00:41:16.511 --> 00:41:21.972]  But it would be more accurate to understand them as the product of democracy already in crisis.
[00:41:22.172 --> 00:41:27.853]  The overall direction of the Guardian is going to be decided by the people who run the trust.
[00:41:28.093 --> 00:41:35.255]  And it will also include many powerful people who are very plugged into the international finance community.
[00:41:35.275 --> 00:41:36.435]  Finance community?
[00:41:36.755 --> 00:41:54.933]  Anytime Guardian columnists Stephen Thrasher, Jonathan Friedland, Gary Young, and Dame Forgan, for that matter, want to have a debate over their claims, myself and a few other InfoWarriors would be happy to educate you on the glaring reality staring you squarely in the face.
[00:41:55.333 --> 00:41:57.495]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:42:06.553 --> 00:42:09.034]  And don't tell me that I'm a weirdo because I'm upset about this.
[00:42:09.134 --> 00:42:11.295]  I'm just sick of dishonorable trash.
[00:42:11.495 --> 00:42:14.636]  Supreme Cobra Commander!
[00:42:14.696 --> 00:42:15.517]  You're failures!
[00:42:15.537 --> 00:42:18.178]  You think I'd sell my family out like you dirtbag!
[00:42:18.905 --> 00:42:19.185]  Lead.
[00:42:19.545 --> 00:42:22.826]  It's a toxic element that can be found in pipes and water infrastructure.
[00:42:22.946 --> 00:42:26.066]  It also recently made national headlines in Flint, Michigan.
[00:42:26.206 --> 00:42:40.069]  But instead of implementing actual solutions, local and federal politicos passed the blame and still, to this day, this neurotoxin is piped into Flint homes where it can cause profound and permanent adverse health effects to the brain and nervous system of children.
[00:42:40.289 --> 00:42:43.610]  This drinking water crisis is not just isolated to Flint, Michigan.
[00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:52.933]  Last week, KERANews.com posted the headline, Flint-like levels of lead detected in water at three Texas centers for the disabled.
[00:42:53.213 --> 00:42:58.014]  Officials at the Brenham, Texas facility are now distributing bottled water to residents and employees.
[00:42:58.274 --> 00:43:09.718]  But the Texas Department of State Health Services and DADS, the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services, want people to be screened for negative long-term effects of exposure, reported the Texas Standard.
[00:43:09.918 --> 00:43:13.779]  The Dallas Morning News also reports that hundreds of disabled Texans
[00:43:14.059 --> 00:43:22.787]  Living at three state-supported living centers have been drinking water that contains toxic amounts of lead, rivaling those found in the water system in Flint, Michigan.
[00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:24.068]  The article continues.
[00:43:24.328 --> 00:43:32.415]  The EPA requires water systems to take steps to reduce lead levels if 10% of the samples taken exceed 15 parts per billion of lead.
[00:43:32.615 --> 00:43:39.101]  Each of the three affected Texas facilities collected samples that contained over 104 parts per billion.
[00:43:39.221 --> 00:43:40.101]  The highest was 266.
[00:43:41.983 --> 00:43:50.347]  Dinesh Boral, head of the Coalition of Texans with Disabilities, told the Texas Standard last week that these facilities have a population of children as well.
[00:43:50.887 --> 00:43:57.330]  Fifteen times the maximum EPA level of lead was found in the drinking water at Brenham State Supported Living Center.
[00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.591]  We're good to go.
[00:44:16.463 --> 00:44:32.760]  In January 2016, KXAN News reported, a KXAN analysis of Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Data found more than 15 local water suppliers with individual test results that show lead levels exceeding 15 parts per billion since 2005.
[00:44:33.261 --> 00:44:36.825]  Findings like these are not limited to Texas or Michigan.
[00:44:37.105 --> 00:44:46.490]  USA Today recently released an article entitled, Beyond Flint, Excessive Lead Levels Found in Almost 2,000 Water Systems Across All 50 States.
[00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:51.773]  The article warns, many of the highest reported lead levels were found at schools and daycares.
[00:44:52.113 --> 00:45:02.018]  A water sample at a Maine elementary school was 42 times higher than the EPA limit of 15 parts per billion, while a Pennsylvania preschool was 14 times higher, records show.
[00:45:02.378 --> 00:45:12.947]  At an elementary school in Ithaca, New York, one sample tested this year at a stunning 5,000 parts per million of lead, the EPA's threshold for hazardous waste.
[00:45:13.287 --> 00:45:23.315]  So while lead in the local Flint, Michigan water supply was a national story, lead in the national water supply is being reduced to nothing more than a few local stories around the country.
[00:45:23.575 --> 00:45:28.279]  According to Healthline.com, lead is a highly toxic metal and a very strong poison.
[00:45:28.459 --> 00:45:31.582]  Lead poisoning usually occurs over a period of months or years.
[00:45:32.102 --> 00:45:35.245]  The poisoning can cause severe mental and physical impairment.
[00:45:35.505 --> 00:45:38.208]  Young children are the most vulnerable to lead poisoning.
[00:45:38.448 --> 00:45:48.477]  Based on these results, it is safe to say that the best option for everybody is to filter all of the water you and your family will consume, whether that means drinking, cooking, or bathing.
[00:45:48.698 --> 00:45:53.262]  Don't depend on your local water utilities to provide you with clean and pure drinking water.
[00:45:53.522 --> 00:45:56.263]  Install a high-end water filtration system in your home.
[00:45:56.383 --> 00:46:02.827]  We have several options at InfoWarsStore.com, all of which reduce lead levels in the water you and your family consume.
[00:46:03.247 --> 00:46:07.049]  Lead is a serious health problem, and the public is not being warned about it.
[00:46:07.369 --> 00:46:15.073]  As more investigations are being conducted, the more it becomes clear that the entire nation, especially our children, are at serious risk of exposure.
[00:46:15.453 --> 00:46:17.394]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:46:20.543 --> 00:46:24.687]  You traitors claiming I'm a Ruski agent, say it to my face and I'll break your nose.
[00:46:24.928 --> 00:46:25.588]  I'm sick of it.
[00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:28.832]  I will stomp your head in the ground, you traitorous maggots.
[00:46:29.092 --> 00:46:42.266]  While we go under Obamacare, North American Union, conquered by European banks, announcing our kids don't belong to us, total bondage, total surveillance, and you want to shoot your mouth off about me being a Ruski agent, I will stomp your head in the ground.
[00:46:42.526 --> 00:46:48.253]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 proof.
[00:46:48.694 --> 00:46:52.599]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:46:54.121 --> 00:46:59.788]  I wish we'd go back to the days, I'm telling you, of getting my satisfaction out in the street.
[00:47:00.794 --> 00:47:02.536]  You pick a sword or something else.

[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:09.804]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.904 --> 00:47:16.712]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.932 --> 00:47:20.194]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.214 --> 00:47:21.394]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.695 --> 00:47:28.098]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.338 --> 00:47:29.158]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.278 --> 00:47:33.261]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:36.642]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.682 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.990]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.921]  And welcome back here on InfoWars Nightly News and this Friday evening edition.
[00:49:09.381 --> 00:49:24.386]  Now we've already seen civil unrest at record levels since the 60s here in the United States, mainly Bernie and Hillary supporters attacking our own Jakari Jackson, hitting him with a rock, attacking police horses with barricades they're throwing at people.
[00:49:25.806 --> 00:49:28.887]  The New York Times calling, you know, for somebody to kill Trump.
[00:49:29.307 --> 00:49:30.728]  Glenn Beck saying he wants to stab him.
[00:49:31.588 --> 00:49:37.612]  The establishment media, the leftists, are really trying to destabilize this country from my historical research.
[00:49:38.233 --> 00:49:47.660]  But Tim Kennedy, Green Beret, tours all over the world, famous UFC fighter obviously, has also worked in some of the most elite units that deal
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.141]  With continuity of government and things like that.
[00:49:50.501 --> 00:49:51.582]  Now, he didn't tell me that.
[00:49:51.602 --> 00:49:52.743]  I know folks that are involved in that.
[00:49:52.783 --> 00:49:53.883]  They say he's one of the top guys.
[00:49:54.263 --> 00:49:56.645]  But he says, yes, I'm an expert and that he can speak to it.
[00:49:57.105 --> 00:50:10.072]  And so I want him to kind of repeat to us what he said behind the scenes about how concerned he is about what is coming, what is already here and how bad it could get and how we stop it and maintain our free, open republic.
[00:50:10.092 --> 00:50:16.796]  Because make no mistake, the Soros-backed globalists want civil disobedience, civil emergencies, riots, looting, race war.
[00:50:17.276 --> 00:50:19.718]  To bring in even greater control later.
[00:50:20.178 --> 00:50:23.421]  They're pushing this to take everybody's free speech in the end.
[00:50:23.761 --> 00:50:30.346]  So, for about eight minutes we have left here in this final segment of InfoWars Nightly News tonight, I'm going to give the floor to Tim Kennedy.
[00:50:31.408 --> 00:50:33.129]  It's a scary thing coming up.
[00:50:33.189 --> 00:50:40.194]  What we know is coming is the perfect petri dish for bad things to happen.
[00:50:40.714 --> 00:50:42.756]  You don't see riots in Chicago in the middle of winter.
[00:50:42.976 --> 00:50:43.476]  It's too cold!
[00:50:43.616 --> 00:50:44.677]  People don't want to go outside, right?
[00:50:45.518 --> 00:50:52.542]  So for really civil unrest to happen, you have to have a bunch of little things that set up for the perfect situation.
[00:50:53.063 --> 00:50:54.644]  You have to have a reason, right?
[00:50:54.664 --> 00:50:57.265]  People are so emotionally involved in this
[00:50:58.166 --> 00:51:10.697]  Presidential election right now and finally for the first time Realizing that there's something wrong with our country that there's been like the existential perspective that the eyes are open eyes wide open.
[00:51:10.737 --> 00:51:22.567]  We know that something's not right the Racial segregation that you know, even though we have a president saying I'm trying to break down borders We've never had so much hate between different racial segments which
[00:51:23.641 --> 00:51:32.966]  Is disheartening and concerning but what's even more scary is we know that all of these things individually are setting up for the perfect opportunity for serious civil unrest.
[00:51:33.426 --> 00:51:38.069]  And now that we're moving into summer, we're moving into the presidential election, we're moving into
[00:51:39.562 --> 00:51:41.283]  Us sending troops back into Iraq.
[00:51:41.463 --> 00:51:58.667]  We're looking at groups and segments of people that are supporting specific presidential nominees that are losing their guy, that are furious over the fact that, you know, Ted Cruz, you know, the never-Trump people, or the never-Hillary people, or the never-Sanders people, all those people are losing their guys and they're only gonna have two options.
[00:51:59.688 --> 00:52:04.669]  And now we have a perfect conducive environment for some serious problems.
[00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:07.690]  You think riots in, you know, Missouri was bad?
[00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:09.491]  Just wait until July.
[00:52:09.931 --> 00:52:10.672]  Just wait until August.
[00:52:10.732 --> 00:52:15.975]  So if the dominoes are set up and lined up and Soros and others want to kick them over, what do we do?
[00:52:16.095 --> 00:52:18.036]  Now you say dominoes, I say the gasoline.
[00:52:18.257 --> 00:52:22.559]  You know, like the trench has been dug and it is just full of accelerants.
[00:52:22.579 --> 00:52:27.343]  You know, like you have every single thing for that fire to just explode.
[00:52:27.823 --> 00:52:29.024]  And now... So the climate's perfect?
[00:52:29.104 --> 00:52:31.125]  Yes, the climate is perfect, the temperature is perfect.
[00:52:32.666 --> 00:52:45.818]  Everything is right for things to go really so the planets are aligning and most analysts are saying that it's happening all over the world We've seen some of the globalists funding Arab Spring, but radical Muslims in and other things How do we counter this I mean educating the public?
[00:52:47.059 --> 00:52:54.686]  Being prepared first of all you know as an individual you have to get ready you have to do all the little things that you know Don't think that people
[00:52:56.283 --> 00:52:58.104]  Don't care if people think that you're crazy.
[00:52:58.204 --> 00:53:01.145]  Don't think that you're being a fanatic, that you're being a prepper.
[00:53:01.965 --> 00:53:03.426]  I'm only responsible for my family.
[00:53:03.566 --> 00:53:04.667]  My family's gonna have food.
[00:53:04.847 --> 00:53:06.147]  My family's gonna have water.
[00:53:06.327 --> 00:53:07.328]  We are gonna be safe.
[00:53:08.308 --> 00:53:12.230]  And if you think I'm crazy because I want to make sure my family's protected, fine, that's the way it is.
[00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:14.831]  But as an individual, you need to look and research
[00:53:15.271 --> 00:53:19.473]  about ways that you need to prepare for what would happen in whatever city you live in.
[00:53:19.873 --> 00:53:27.837]  If you're in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Trump comes to town, and the whole entire city loses its mind, they're breaking horses' legs, they're throwing Molotov cocktails.
[00:53:29.155 --> 00:53:32.779]  That's in May, before we even have him as a nominee.
[00:53:32.799 --> 00:53:38.366]  What do you think's gonna happen in August, when we're just a couple of months away from the election, when things are really ripe?
[00:53:38.626 --> 00:53:40.468]  It can get bad, and it can get bad fast.
[00:53:40.548 --> 00:53:45.414]  You need to do the research and figure out what you have to do to really prepare to make sure that your family's safe.
[00:53:45.834 --> 00:53:47.435]  So August, September, key times.
[00:53:47.915 --> 00:53:51.616]  Yeah, July, August, September, all the way up into, you know, finally November.
[00:53:51.636 --> 00:54:04.241]  When it starts cooling off, people get a little bit, while their emotions get higher, because we're getting closer to an election, you know, the temperature and the environment will maybe preclude people from getting out in the streets.
[00:54:05.396 --> 00:54:07.577]  Also, I see political solutions to this.
[00:54:07.797 --> 00:54:14.639]  Letting Hillary Clinton, George Soros, Obama and others who can't win political debates but want to try to throw the country into crisis.
[00:54:15.039 --> 00:54:19.941]  It's important to know that they've done this all over the world and to let them know and the public know that they're going to be held accountable.
[00:54:20.321 --> 00:54:29.064]  I mean, I think at a certain point when George Soros has spent, in just Ferguson alone, $35 million or $33 million trying to cause race war and attack on the police.
[00:54:29.824 --> 00:54:31.545]  I mean, it's clear that's sedition.
[00:54:31.945 --> 00:54:33.867]  And how long is this guy allowed to do this?
[00:54:33.927 --> 00:54:35.407]  I mean, I defend the First Amendment.
[00:54:35.768 --> 00:54:36.668]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[00:54:36.688 --> 00:54:37.309]  So are you, Tim.
[00:54:37.629 --> 00:54:46.554]  But at a certain point, when you've got some outsider trying to destabilize the country, that's criminal sabotage, in my view.
[00:54:46.574 --> 00:54:48.195]  There's got to be some limit to this.
[00:54:48.215 --> 00:54:49.236]  I mean, if I went to Europe...
[00:54:50.265 --> 00:54:56.650]  And if I had billions of dollars, or some other country or region, and tried to finance destabilization, people would come after me.
[00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:57.691]  Yeah, they'd hang you.
[00:54:58.211 --> 00:55:01.934]  If you walk into a movie theater, and you scream fire, you go to jail.
[00:55:03.595 --> 00:55:05.377]  You know, you've committed a crime.
[00:55:05.437 --> 00:55:05.877]  Absolutely.
[00:55:05.917 --> 00:55:12.903]  And that is what they're doing on a micro-scale into individual cities, into even states.
[00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:17.887]  And now, nationally, they are inciting and encouraging racial wars and riots.
[00:55:18.689 --> 00:55:23.631]  It's like our worst nightmare has come to fruition.
[00:55:23.711 --> 00:55:31.833]  We are actually realizing that you put these people in front of a camera and give them a microphone and they're enabling other people to hurt police officers.
[00:55:32.453 --> 00:55:34.814]  To go and stab and riot and
[00:55:36.417 --> 00:55:39.459]  Everything that we're against as a nation, these people are encouraged.
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:46.685]  And it's the very same Peter Southerland, George Soros, and others that are in Europe that have let five million, quote, refugees in that you've talked about.
[00:55:48.967 --> 00:55:49.847]  How big are these cells?
[00:55:50.047 --> 00:55:52.229]  How big is the danger of what's happened in Europe?
[00:55:52.249 --> 00:55:56.752]  Because, you know, here they use a bunch of leftist mobs and others brainwashed by the public school system.
[00:55:57.113 --> 00:56:01.476]  Over in Europe, they're bringing in five million jihadis, 80% are military-aged men, I'm told.
[00:56:02.136 --> 00:56:03.778]  From your connections and research, is that accurate?
[00:56:04.281 --> 00:56:13.683]  Yeah, so if you bring in, let's say 100 people, we know somewhere between 10 to 15 of them have been radicalized, that they're extremists.
[00:56:14.343 --> 00:56:21.765]  So when you're talking that you're bringing in a million people, how many of those now do we know are extremists?
[00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:21.765]  150,000.
[00:56:21.865 --> 00:56:25.066]  50,000!
[00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:25.066]  Now look at what one does in San Bernardino.
[00:56:25.386 --> 00:56:29.107]  One guy and his stupid wife go and start mowing down people.
[00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:31.188]  That's one dude.
[00:56:31.228 --> 00:56:32.228]  They're liberal co-workers.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.142]  Think about what 100,000 of them could do in this country.
[00:56:37.803 --> 00:56:39.725]  What they're going to do in Europe in the next five years.
[00:56:40.705 --> 00:56:41.086]  It's coming.
[00:56:41.646 --> 00:56:43.708]  So why would Merkel and Hollande and others bring them in?
[00:56:44.348 --> 00:56:47.811]  Use the civil emergency to ban nationalist and patriot speech.
[00:56:47.831 --> 00:56:48.391]  That's what they've done.
[00:56:49.152 --> 00:56:51.594]  If you want to be able to shut people up, you have to use fear.
[00:56:52.114 --> 00:56:58.859]  So the definition of terrorism is to use fear or violence as a tool, as a weapon to achieve your objectives, right?
[00:57:01.189 --> 00:57:09.915]  If you're a politician, you can use that same fear to take away freedoms, to pass acts that give you access to every single iPhone out there.
[00:57:10.015 --> 00:57:10.995]  Be like, no, no, it's a terrorist.
[00:57:11.015 --> 00:57:12.476]  We need to get inside of that guy's phone.
[00:57:12.776 --> 00:57:13.437]  He's really bad.
[00:57:13.657 --> 00:57:17.700]  Just give us access to all iPhones so we can protect you.
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:19.701]  That's terrorism in my definition.
[00:57:19.941 --> 00:57:21.802]  You're using fear as a weapon.
[00:57:23.596 --> 00:57:24.677]  Absolutely.
[00:57:25.298 --> 00:57:27.279]  Wow, Tim Kennedy, that was powerful info.
[00:57:27.359 --> 00:57:35.866]  The whole country, the whole world's in danger of escalated civil unrest, like Google financing the Arab Spring to just bring in that tyranny and these vultures sit on top of it.
[00:57:36.146 --> 00:57:40.650]  You're getting folks ready with SheepdogResponse.com and more.
[00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.351]  We're trying to get people ready by informing them.
[00:57:42.631 --> 00:57:47.055]  Thanks for coming in with your geopolitical and military and just common sense analysis.

[00:57:49.977 --> 00:57:52.878]  All right, folks, that's it for this edition of InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:58:07.863 --> 00:58:08.523]  God bless you all.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:23.409]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:25.612]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:58:25.772 --> 00:58:26.332]  Think about it.
[00:58:26.532 --> 00:58:32.318]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:58:32.578 --> 00:58:38.144]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:58:38.524 --> 00:58:50.289]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:53.330]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:55.991]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:58:56.312 --> 00:59:00.753]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:59:01.194 --> 00:59:01.774]  Think about it.
[00:59:03.837 --> 00:59:04.998]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:05.338 --> 00:59:16.445]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep, restful sleep, Knockout's it.
