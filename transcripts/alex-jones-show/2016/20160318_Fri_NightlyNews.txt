[00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:22.091]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:23.393]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:25.737]  It is March 18th, 2016.
[00:00:26.057 --> 00:00:29.062]  Now coming up right after this break, we have a special report from Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.382 --> 00:00:31.466]  But first, here's a look at what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:38.339]  Tonight, the world's most wanted terrorist is caught.
[00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:39.980]  No, not that guy.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.482]  He's still vacationing in Florida.
[00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:51.968]  This guy, Salah Abdeslam, the ISIS fugitive behind the Paris massacre, is shot in the leg and captured alive by police.
[00:00:52.768 --> 00:01:04.496]  Then, while the national spotlight focuses on the drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, a USA Today investigation discovers what InfoWars has been saying all along.
[00:01:04.837 --> 00:01:06.858]  Your tap water is poison.
[00:01:07.298 --> 00:01:20.428]  Plus, the campaign for $15 an hour minimum wage has met its match, as the fast food industry considers automated restaurants, where customers never see a live human being.
[00:01:20.868 --> 00:01:23.635]  Enjoy your extra big ass fries!
[00:01:24.236 --> 00:01:28.245]  All that plus much more up next on the Info Wars Nightly News!

[00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:47.736]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here on InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:19.652]  To break down probably the most important Trump information that we've ever discussed in the year that we've been following him on the campaign trail.
[00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:22.493]  The international sensation, whether you love him or hate him.
[00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:27.535]  Now in the process of covering Trump, I didn't support him a year ago.
[00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:29.936]  I began to thaw to him about six months ago.
[00:03:31.172 --> 00:03:38.877]  And I'm about to break down bombshell information about Trump that nobody else knows and that nobody else has talked about.
[00:03:39.398 --> 00:03:42.720]  Because it's my moral responsibility to relay this to you.
[00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:56.730]  Now here in the headline, I'm making the point that this is devastating Donald Trump information and that this new leaked information will absolutely
[00:03:58.362 --> 00:04:01.651]  Change the world if the people discover it and pay attention to it.
[00:04:02.353 --> 00:04:02.915]  And it's this.
[00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:06.605]  Donald Trump is for real.
[00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:11.314]  Donald Trump really does want to save his country.
[00:04:12.015 --> 00:04:27.483]  Donald Trump really does know about the new world order, about globalism, about the big mega banks coming in and taking control of this country and other nations, and that they have a plan to bankrupt nation states, to fold them into a private corporate government.
[00:04:27.743 --> 00:04:35.887]  A form of neo-colonialism, where the big offshore banks actually colonize through banking fraud and take control of the nation states, like you see in Ireland.
[00:04:36.427 --> 00:04:43.955]  Like you've seen in Spain, in Greece, in Italy, where they even appoint former Goldman Sachs heads to be the presidents.
[00:04:45.356 --> 00:04:46.277]  Trump is for real.
[00:04:47.098 --> 00:05:00.570]  And the bombshell info is, I was told information by Roger Stone, his longtime confidant of 40 plus years, running buddies, not just a political advisor, former head of his campaign, a lot of private things, but also
[00:05:01.772 --> 00:05:06.913]  Public things about Trump and what Trump would do and what he thought Trump was going to say.
[00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:09.974]  And in every case, weeks later, Trump would come out and do it.
[00:05:10.434 --> 00:05:12.575]  And it wasn't because Stone was telling him what to say.
[00:05:12.975 --> 00:05:16.156]  He was talking to Trump and was aware of what Trump was going to do.
[00:05:16.176 --> 00:05:20.697]  I mean, I said a week before, Trump's going to come out against the private Federal Reserve and call for an audit.
[00:05:20.897 --> 00:05:21.298]  He did that.
[00:05:21.578 --> 00:05:22.358]  So I was told by Stone.
[00:05:23.058 --> 00:05:25.540]  But what I'm about to break down here, most of it didn't come from Stone.
[00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:37.332]  Stone was telling me things, and then I knew other famous people that are friends with Trump, who've known him for years, who vacationed with him and things like that, and local Austin billionaires, you name it.
[00:05:40.595 --> 00:05:46.881]  And it turns out, just like Hollywood's awake to the new world order, but are scared to talk about it, a bunch of these nouveau riche and wealthy people
[00:05:47.864 --> 00:05:49.065]  Do you want to have a free market?
[00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:50.506]  Do you want to have a wealthy country?
[00:05:50.786 --> 00:05:53.648]  Do you want to have the general public become wealthy and successful as well?
[00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:59.131]  And Donald Trump, here's the big news, is actually basically an info warrior.
[00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:07.016]  But before he was ever an info warrior, I mean before info wars existed, Donald Trump gets it all.
[00:06:07.616 --> 00:06:09.777]  Donald Trump knows as much of this as I do.
[00:06:10.418 --> 00:06:10.838]  Or more.
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.061]  And he's been an entertainer.
[00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:14.881]  He's played along.
[00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.022]  He just wanted to be a businessman.
[00:06:16.262 --> 00:06:17.803]  He kept thinking things would get fixed.
[00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:24.647]  And I was told this over, you know, eight, nine months ago by Stone when the Trump campaign approached me.
[00:06:26.588 --> 00:06:28.709]  And Stone said, listen, he doesn't want America to be wrecked.
[00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:32.251]  He knows these foreign businesses and banks and special interests are gutting the country.
[00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:33.011]  He hates it.
[00:06:33.252 --> 00:06:34.072]  He loves this country.
[00:06:34.272 --> 00:06:35.733]  He hates seeing Americans become poor.
[00:06:36.894 --> 00:06:38.815]  He wants to see a rising tide raising all ships.
[00:06:39.918 --> 00:06:49.082]  And then months later, it was in Politico from other people, 20 plus top Republicans met in his New York offices and they had sub sandwiches together for an hour and a half meeting.
[00:06:49.462 --> 00:06:51.243]  And Trump said, I'm not letting them wreck America.
[00:06:51.263 --> 00:06:52.583]  I'm not letting them de-industrialize it.
[00:06:52.824 --> 00:06:54.384]  I'm not letting these foreign elites do this.
[00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:55.845]  We're not going to have America conquered.
[00:06:56.065 --> 00:07:04.849]  My point is everything Stone told me about that ended up being from other people's quotes, knowing Trump exactly what really happened inside, even from his enemy, Politico.
[00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:12.034]  So then I talked to some other people that know Trump and they said the same thing, but it was different events, so I wasn't putting it all together.
[00:07:12.094 --> 00:07:28.426]  Then Dr. Jerome Corsi was on the show, PhD political science, international banking, Harvard, worked in clandestine operations all over the world, anti-terrorism, three-time number one New York Times bestseller, and friends with Donald Trump for 40 years in business.
[00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:36.830]  And I knew that, you know, I've been on break before when Donald Trump has, you know, like five or six years ago, called Corsi up.
[00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.791]  He's like, oh, that was Donald Trump, you know, when he's on Skype.
[00:07:42.952 --> 00:07:45.512]  So, I mean, he's good friends with me, too, and I started just clicking.
[00:07:45.792 --> 00:07:47.413]  So I was asking him on air, what type of guy is he?
[00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:48.093]  What's he stand for?
[00:07:48.393 --> 00:07:50.653]  And Corsi on air said he knows everything.
[00:07:50.873 --> 00:07:52.694]  He knows everything I know, everything you know.
[00:07:53.234 --> 00:07:54.194]  Believe me, he's got a plan.
[00:07:55.509 --> 00:08:08.351]  And so I'm going to get Corsi back on and talk more about it, but he was just saying what all these other big insiders told me, that no, he knows all about NAFTA, all about GATT, all about the New World Order, and you see him in his policy saying that, he just doesn't sensationalize it.
[00:08:08.731 --> 00:08:13.792]  With its global government taking us over, he speaks at a blue-collar level that he knows the public will understand.
[00:08:14.092 --> 00:08:22.414]  He even dumbs down his speech on purpose to reach the general public, because he knows they'll get lost in all the complexity.
[00:08:26.017 --> 00:08:28.438]  Is that a blow against him, or is that positive that he's able to do that?
[00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:34.741]  I mean, he's got this whole, yeah, you know, dumb schmo thing going on, and that ain't it.
[00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:41.284]  I mean, of course he ran serious operations for the government as a private contractor, super clandestine stuff.
[00:08:41.624 --> 00:08:42.784]  He's a super sharp guy.
[00:08:42.804 --> 00:08:45.065]  Why do you think Trump calls him up for advice on things?
[00:08:45.586 --> 00:08:47.566]  Or not even so much advice, he bounces things off people.
[00:08:48.087 --> 00:08:51.168]  So there's a bunch of people I can't mention at Sayers, it was told to me in confidence.
[00:08:52.970 --> 00:09:08.202]  I was told over a year ago when he was first running by a prominent person that's friends with him that, oh, you didn't know that Trump sees you as the underground and he's going to basically take this anti-globalist New World Order stuff mainstream and that you're going to cover the underground and he's going to cover the above ground?
[00:09:08.662 --> 00:09:10.804]  And I'm sitting there hearing this going, oh yeah, Donald Trump.
[00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:15.588]  But then I heard Matt Drudge, you know, a decade ago was a listener, and then he's visited the office and is a daily listener.
[00:09:15.628 --> 00:09:19.431]  You know, I was told the Japanese deputy president was a listener, and he's come on the show.
[00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:24.054]  I was told the head of the German CIA was a listener, and he's been on the show.
[00:09:24.094 --> 00:09:27.737]  I mean, InfoWars is really big, but it's not about me.
[00:09:29.118 --> 00:09:30.840]  I'm talking about all this right now.
[00:09:32.062 --> 00:09:39.927]  Because you need to know that it just kind of built up and I had never really talked about it, that all these insiders go, Hey, Alex, Trump's on the team.
[00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:42.088]  He was on the team before you were on the air.
[00:09:43.189 --> 00:09:43.449]  Okay.
[00:09:43.889 --> 00:09:45.370]  He just knew the public wasn't ready yet.
[00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.051]  And the country's hanging by a thread.
[00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:48.071]  He's for real.
[00:09:49.832 --> 00:09:50.593]  He's for real.
[00:09:51.293 --> 00:09:52.714]  And he's going for it all.
[00:09:53.054 --> 00:09:59.458]  And that's why K Street and the lobbyist and the political class that have hijacked the nation are so scared because they've been tapping his phones.
[00:09:59.478 --> 00:10:00.779]  They've got dossiers on Trump.
[00:10:02.122 --> 00:10:07.347]  And he tried to sneak up on them and, you know, get in with them thinking he'd work with them.
[00:10:07.468 --> 00:10:12.853]  They know and they're scared because let me tell you something, Donald Trump, thank God he has a big ego.
[00:10:12.953 --> 00:10:15.476]  Thank God he likes, you know, the founding fathers in America.
[00:10:15.856 --> 00:10:17.958]  He really wants to be the guy that saves America.
[00:10:18.239 --> 00:10:23.063]  Wouldn't that be cooler to bring back prosperity and save America and defeat the globalists?
[00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:25.306]  That's bigger than defeating the Soviet Union.
[00:10:27.156 --> 00:10:34.938]  Soros, as Buckley pointed out before we shot this, is like in a wheelchair with oxygen tanks, like a James Bond villain, manipulating through surrogates, and the Koch brothers are.
[00:10:35.658 --> 00:10:38.559]  Trump's right out in the open going, I don't like the political system.
[00:10:38.819 --> 00:10:40.039]  It's legal, but I don't like it.
[00:10:40.179 --> 00:10:41.240]  You have to buy these people.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.580]  And I'm sick of foreign interests buying them.
[00:10:44.301 --> 00:10:45.341]  I'm going to try to put an end to that.
[00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:48.802]  I've done well in this country, and now it's time for me to pay back.
[00:10:49.222 --> 00:10:50.682]  He really means that.
[00:10:51.903 --> 00:10:52.963]  And that's why he doesn't care.
[00:10:54.153 --> 00:11:01.239]  If he loses all these businesses or loses billions of dollars, which he's lost about 500 million, it's estimated, just since the campaign, people demonizing him.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.423]  He said, hey, there'll be no country left if we don't turn this around.
[00:11:05.763 --> 00:11:19.475]  So the big news is, the big scandal is, the horrible international globalists that launch all these wars and give each other Nobel Peace Prizes, that do all these evil things that have gotten America in debt by design and that have dumbed down our education and opened our borders and sold out our industry.
[00:11:20.902 --> 00:11:29.573]  They're having conniption fits to the point that the Republican leadership of the RNC Rules Committee has to go on CNBC and say, your vote never counted.
[00:11:30.093 --> 00:11:32.656]  Don't vote for Trump because we're just going to take the delegates anyways.
[00:11:33.557 --> 00:11:37.042]  And the reporter goes, so why we have primaries?
[00:11:37.082 --> 00:11:37.883]  He goes, good point.
[00:11:38.482 --> 00:11:44.064]  The media has created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination, and that's the conflict here.
[00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.384]  We feel like we live in a democratic society.
[00:11:46.424 --> 00:11:52.126]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation, correct?
[00:11:53.006 --> 00:11:54.186]  No, that's not what I'm trying to tell you.
[00:11:54.206 --> 00:11:57.527]  What I'm trying to say is that we're just one of the political parties.
[00:11:57.928 --> 00:12:04.369]  There's many political parties, but political parties choose their nominee, not the general public, contrary to popular belief.
[00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:06.290]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:08.422]  That's a very good question.
[00:12:28.971 --> 00:12:32.912]  That he's trying to return power to the people and do basic things.
[00:12:33.112 --> 00:12:34.452]  Like he says, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
[00:12:34.752 --> 00:12:39.314]  You just say, hey China, you can't have a 30-40% currency tariff on our goods.
[00:12:40.214 --> 00:12:41.534]  They go, oh, that's protectionism!
[00:12:42.274 --> 00:12:43.995]  No, that's a screw job by them.
[00:12:44.335 --> 00:12:45.255]  You'd better stop it.
[00:12:46.175 --> 00:12:46.736]  That alone.
[00:12:46.916 --> 00:12:48.856]  He says, hey, they've shut off a thousand of our power plants.
[00:12:49.196 --> 00:12:50.777]  That's almost double our energy prices.
[00:12:51.057 --> 00:12:52.717]  You can't have a factory here, it's too expensive.
[00:12:53.337 --> 00:12:54.497]  We're going to take those restrictions off.
[00:12:55.838 --> 00:12:56.258]  They're clean.
[00:12:57.622 --> 00:13:02.683]  The globalists could make more money selling pieces of our economy off to India and Mexico and China.
[00:13:04.744 --> 00:13:06.464]  And Trump really needs to break that.
[00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:09.425]  He really wants to be the greatest president ever.
[00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:12.406]  And he's in a position to do it.
[00:13:13.046 --> 00:13:14.427]  No wonder he's so confident.
[00:13:14.467 --> 00:13:15.927]  No wonder he's so fearless.
[00:13:17.348 --> 00:13:18.748]  And to learn that
[00:13:22.662 --> 00:13:33.529]  That he's aware of the show and what we cover, and I'm not going to get into it, and I'm not going to give inside baseball, but down the road, it feels really good to know I'm influencing the campaign.
[00:13:33.969 --> 00:13:34.850]  I'm influencing Trump.
[00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.770]  You're influencing him.
[00:13:36.391 --> 00:13:37.371]  He's learning, too.
[00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:41.234]  It's exciting.
[00:13:41.274 --> 00:13:44.696]  It's an exciting time to be alive, and there's a reason they're scared to death of him.
[00:13:44.736 --> 00:13:45.777]  So that's the bottom line.
[00:13:46.037 --> 00:13:47.418]  Donald Trump is anti-New World Order.
[00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:52.337]  Donald Trump knows more than he's saying, and that's why they're so scared of him.
[00:13:52.738 --> 00:13:56.280]  And I've had all these insiders that know him go, you didn't know he's anti-new world order?
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.001]  You don't know he knows about globalism?
[00:13:58.241 --> 00:14:03.584]  You don't know he plans to try to defeat all this and truly bring America back and make us free and open again?
[00:14:05.065 --> 00:14:07.027]  It's an incredible time to be alive.
[00:14:07.547 --> 00:14:09.788]  Now, back to InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:13.491]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4-6pm, with a Sunday transmission as well.
[00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:14.852]  If you're watching this,
[00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:25.956]  Program folks, it's up to you to spread the word and realize what's happening and to realize that we've been artificially suppressed so that we can become poor so they can micromanage our lives.
[00:14:26.316 --> 00:14:27.237]  They want us poor.
[00:14:27.537 --> 00:14:29.798]  So we're too busy trying to work to get food.
[00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:31.119]  So we're not too uppity.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.121]  And Donald Trump doesn't like that.
[00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:34.862]  He doesn't like poverty.
[00:14:34.902 --> 00:14:36.203]  He doesn't like us collapsing.
[00:14:36.503 --> 00:14:37.924]  He doesn't like us being engineered.
[00:14:37.944 --> 00:14:39.324]  He doesn't like political correctness.
[00:14:39.544 --> 00:14:41.285]  He doesn't like Christians being demonized.
[00:14:41.605 --> 00:14:43.186]  He doesn't like seeing us be enslaved.
[00:14:43.406 --> 00:14:48.168]  He doesn't like seeing arrogant, murderous, third world jihadis coming in here to boss us around.
[00:14:48.689 --> 00:14:49.369]  He's sick of it!
[00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.391]  It's a basic male instinct and it's exciting.
[00:14:53.831 --> 00:14:56.212]  And that's why more than ever, I am so glad I'm backing Trump.
[00:14:56.772 --> 00:14:57.473]  He's not perfect.
[00:14:57.493 --> 00:15:02.035]  We're gonna try to keep him honest, but he's giving the globalists a run for their money and they are scared to death.
[00:15:07.205 --> 00:15:20.016]  Recently, President Obama and his motorcade of citywide gridlock rolled into Austin, Texas, to push more Big Brother-style federal control of the technology sector at the 2016 South by Southwest Festival.
[00:15:20.216 --> 00:15:27.522]  But it was a remark he made during his stop at a Democratic National Committee reception that drew ire to the ears of anyone
[00:15:27.622 --> 00:15:28.022]  How so, you ask?
[00:15:28.082 --> 00:15:32.245]  Obama was referring to the comparison of Border Patrol apprehension numbers in the 1970s to the present numbers.
[00:15:55.982 --> 00:16:02.470]  The DHS defines apprehension data as data representing events and not individuals.
[00:16:02.891 --> 00:16:06.095]  Since 1970, apprehension numbers rose from 231,116 to 888,729 by 1979.
[00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:20.511]  Apprehensions continued to increase, averaging in the millions through the 80s, the 90s, and the beginning of the new millennium.
[00:16:20.852 --> 00:16:33.705]  Under George W. Bush, apprehension numbers began to decline in 2007 after Bush urged Congress to allow more than 12 million illegal immigrants to work in the United States under a temporary guest worker program.
[00:16:33.985 --> 00:16:45.409]  As the presidential baton was handed to yet another New World Order puppet, Obama opened the floodgates for a mass exodus with an unconstitutional executive order protecting 5 million illegals.
[00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:57.394]  Meanwhile, in February of 2016, DHS quietly created a new policy making it mandatory for Border Patrol agents to release illegals without a notice to appear before a judge.
[00:16:57.674 --> 00:16:59.075]  The numbers don't lie.
[00:16:59.375 --> 00:17:02.616]  It's Obama's claim that is a bold-faced deception.
[00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:11.942]  The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that at least 2.5 million illegals have settled in the United States since Obama took office.
[00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:14.204]  Far more than came in under Bush.
[00:17:14.444 --> 00:17:19.488]  But those numbers are hard to gauge as the Border Patrol's hands are tied on apprehensions.
[00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:23.450]  The official death toll from the cartel violence in Mexico is 60,000.
[00:17:23.551 --> 00:17:26.513]  This is more than the United States military lost in Vietnam.
[00:17:27.153 --> 00:17:35.277]  However, the unofficial death toll in Mexico is over 120,000 killed and another 27,000 missing and presumed dead.
[00:17:35.797 --> 00:17:39.959]  In Mexico, the cartels kill without hesitation or fear of prosecution.
[00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:45.362]  In May of this year, cartel members shot down a Mexican Army helicopter in the state of Jalisco.
[00:17:46.122 --> 00:17:50.924]  Why would we expect them to behave any differently on the U.S.-Mexico border?
[00:17:51.204 --> 00:17:54.926]  In 2014, the Border Patrol apprehended and arrested just under 500,000 illegal immigrants.
[00:17:56.696 --> 00:18:02.280]  Meaning that one in every five arrests last year by the Border Patrol was a criminal alien.
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.803]  Almost 50% of the criminal aliens deported in 2014 were convicted of aggravated felonies.
[00:18:08.364 --> 00:18:13.407]  These charges include murder, rape, sexual assault of a child, and drug and weapons trafficking.
[00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:20.312]  These are not petty criminals and approximately 60% of those deported last year had already been deported at least once before.
[00:18:20.712 --> 00:18:34.739]  Now the immigration crisis has fallen into the laps of state game wardens who are now using devices to detect radioactive material being smuggled into the United States that could be used in a nuclear terroristic event.
[00:18:34.999 --> 00:18:44.424]  Clearly, national security has been grossly compromised and the New World Order puppet-in-chief has something nefariously lurking up his sleeve.
[00:18:44.924 --> 00:18:46.865]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:19:02.705 --> 00:19:06.127]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:19:06.468 --> 00:19:13.612]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:19:14.213 --> 00:19:22.598]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:19:22.839 --> 00:19:26.941]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:19:27.261 --> 00:19:32.585]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:32.845]  Let's do it!

[00:20:44.087 --> 00:20:44.688]  We're good to go.
[00:21:00.831 --> 00:21:06.314]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:21:06.574 --> 00:21:21.023]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.

[00:21:42.546 --> 00:21:50.368]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:21:50.528 --> 00:21:55.949]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:21:55.969 --> 00:21:59.510]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.

[00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:07.135]  Now we have some good news for the people of Paris.
[00:23:07.195 --> 00:23:13.758]  One of the Paris attackers has reportedly been found and they say he was shot in the leg and captured alive by police commandos.
[00:23:14.158 --> 00:23:15.519]  And this is a 26-year-old.
[00:23:15.959 --> 00:23:18.660]  He was wounded then retreated into a house in Molenbeek.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.062]  The terror suspect was with two other men and one of the men may be dead.
[00:23:23.582 --> 00:23:31.609]  He is believed to have played a key role in November's Paris attacks, and he could have spent days, weeks, or months at the flat where he was found.
[00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.452]  Yes, if you guys recall, it was a very terrible tragedy.
[00:23:34.492 --> 00:23:35.753]  We actually sent a team out there.
[00:23:35.793 --> 00:23:39.937]  Joe Biggs and Paul Joseph Watson were investigating the scene out there.
[00:23:39.957 --> 00:23:47.284]  They actually got to see a little bit of action, saw the aftermath of a shootout there in Paris, and now they reportedly have this guy in custody.
[00:23:47.364 --> 00:23:49.786]  So, maybe he'll spill the beans, tell of a
[00:23:50.086 --> 00:23:50.746]  We're good to go.
[00:24:18.544 --> 00:24:22.129]  And they said a field test indicated that the white powder was not dangerous.
[00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:27.777]  And the letter also said it had a note threatening Trump's other children if he did not drop out of the race.
[00:24:28.318 --> 00:24:33.346]  Secret Service, FBI, and the NYPD are investigating the letter sent from Massachusetts.
[00:24:35.089 --> 00:24:44.153]  Now, I've seen a lot of threats against Trump, you know, whether it's they're going to storm his events to have these mass protests planned and all that stuff.
[00:24:44.173 --> 00:24:46.014]  If you guys want to protest peacefully, that's fine.
[00:24:46.034 --> 00:24:46.774]  That's your business.
[00:24:46.794 --> 00:24:48.074]  I have no issue with that.
[00:24:48.134 --> 00:24:51.776]  But like I said, if you're threatening somebody's children, you're going a bridge too far.
[00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:54.177]  You're really hitting below the belt on that.
[00:24:54.537 --> 00:24:59.099]  If you want to disagree with the guy calling the radio shows, you know, when he's on or whatever, disagree with him.
[00:24:59.119 --> 00:24:59.599]  That's fine.
[00:24:59.619 --> 00:25:00.940]  But don't threaten the man's children.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.241]  And as we're talking about this presidential race, let's take a look at Marco Rubio.
[00:25:05.281 --> 00:25:07.862]  He's saying he's not going to be anybody's vice president.
[00:25:08.362 --> 00:25:12.823]  And he said this when he was asked on Thursday whether he would consider a vice presidency spot.
[00:25:13.243 --> 00:25:16.944]  And he told reporters, point blank, I'm not going to be anybody's vice president.
[00:25:17.344 --> 00:25:20.965]  He went on to say that he does not mean that in any type of disrespectful way.
[00:25:21.505 --> 00:25:24.489]  He just said that he's going to finish out his term as a senator.
[00:25:24.569 --> 00:25:26.772]  He's not going for a governor or any other position.
[00:25:27.133 --> 00:25:29.196]  Then he just wants to be a private citizen.
[00:25:29.216 --> 00:25:31.379]  And, you know, go ahead, Marco.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.643]  You didn't so much bow out gracefully, but you did bow out.
[00:25:34.723 --> 00:25:36.225]  If you want to go on and live a private life,
[00:25:36.806 --> 00:25:37.646]  It's no issue with me.
[00:25:37.666 --> 00:25:39.687]  I actually wish more politicians would do this.
[00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:41.867]  They'd go out in the political sphere.
[00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:43.407]  They'd see that maybe it's not for them.
[00:25:43.447 --> 00:25:47.328]  Then they'd go open a blockbuster, whatever people do.
[00:25:47.768 --> 00:25:51.309]  And he went on to add that he would not seek re-election in his home state.
[00:25:51.609 --> 00:25:56.970]  So he's going to ride off into the sunset like Shane on his horse, looking for greener pastures.
[00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:59.631]  And as we're talking about green, why don't we talk about a green substance?
[00:25:59.651 --> 00:26:01.031]  Why don't we talk about plutonium?
[00:26:01.491 --> 00:26:04.872]  Japan is going to send weapons-grade plutonium back to the U.S.
[00:26:04.912 --> 00:26:06.713]  this weekend, says Greenpeace.
[00:26:06.773 --> 00:26:11.255]  Now, of course, Japan is being very hush-hush on this, so this is he said, she said.
[00:26:11.735 --> 00:26:22.740]  But the shipment of 331 kilograms of plutonium, enough to make about 50 nuclear weapons, will be loaded in an armed British ship and transported to South Carolina.
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.021]  We're good to go.
[00:26:39.444 --> 00:26:39.905]  We're good to go.
[00:27:00.663 --> 00:27:04.044]  Fourteen at Nuke Base probe for illegal drug activity.
[00:27:04.705 --> 00:27:17.750]  An Air Force unit responsible for guarding nuclear missiles in Wyoming, Colorado, and Nebraska are under investigation for possible illegal drug activity, including cases involving cocaine, defense officials said on Friday.
[00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.891]  They say it's a new blow to the missile corps.
[00:27:19.911 --> 00:27:25.173]  They said they've had lapses in security and training and things aren't exactly going right.
[00:27:26.033 --> 00:27:31.576]  And it really concerns me to think about guys with the nuclear button, the nuclear football, you see them in the movies and all this stuff.
[00:27:31.996 --> 00:27:35.878]  They may be shooting up coke in the bathroom or whatever the case may be.
[00:27:36.599 --> 00:27:40.261]  And I understand, you know, it's been a very long time since they've had to launch a nuke.
[00:27:40.461 --> 00:27:46.384]  I'm sure it's a very lax atmosphere in some regards, but still, you really have to take a tough look at this.
[00:27:46.404 --> 00:27:51.887]  If the guys want to go drink, you know, smoke a little bit on their off time, that doesn't bother me, but you shouldn't go into work
[00:27:52.347 --> 00:27:52.828]  We're good to go.
[00:28:09.671 --> 00:28:16.736]  Now, as we're talking about things that can get very serious, we've seen the stories about the water going on in Flint, and it is indeed a crisis.
[00:28:17.336 --> 00:28:20.879]  The governor came out, had a very lax response in my personal opinion.
[00:28:20.919 --> 00:28:22.040]  They said they're going to look into it.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.800]  Mistakes were made.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.581]  We're moving on, trying to get into it.
[00:28:24.982 --> 00:28:26.843]  But now we see a report from USA Today.
[00:28:27.123 --> 00:28:32.927]  They say that they found excessive lead levels in almost 2,000 water systems across all 50 states.
[00:28:34.088 --> 00:28:39.551]  And they said that many of the highest reported levels were found in schools and daycares.
[00:28:40.011 --> 00:28:51.817]  A water sample at a Maine elementary school was 42 times higher than the EPA limit of 15 parts per billion, while a Pennsylvania preschool was 14 times higher.
[00:28:52.098 --> 00:28:52.698]  Record shows.
[00:28:52.758 --> 00:28:54.019]  And it goes on from there.
[00:28:55.139 --> 00:29:00.082]  And it reminds me, you know, back when I lived in Oklahoma, my dad had some very questionable water.
[00:29:00.102 --> 00:29:01.903]  It wasn't brown or anything, but it had a lot of
[00:29:02.843 --> 00:29:04.625]  It would appear to be particulate in it.
[00:29:04.665 --> 00:29:05.885]  I'm not exactly sure what it was.
[00:29:05.905 --> 00:29:07.447]  I don't know if it was lead or whatever else.
[00:29:07.507 --> 00:29:10.969]  But, you know, he began feeling kind of ill from drinking it.
[00:29:11.009 --> 00:29:11.930]  He switched to bottled water.
[00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.850]  Now he feels fine.
[00:29:13.271 --> 00:29:15.993]  So this is something that people really need to take into account.
[00:29:16.053 --> 00:29:19.995]  Similar to the nuclear thing, we think all the best minds and the best people are at work on this.
[00:29:20.296 --> 00:29:30.223]  When you see 42 times higher than what the EPA regulates at daycares and elementary schools, that should really shock you and really consider what's in your tap water.
[00:29:30.663 --> 00:29:32.385]  So don't believe the hype.
[00:29:32.405 --> 00:29:35.770]  Don't believe everything they tell you when they say, you know, just drink the water down.
[00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:41.477]  You might want to test that at least occasionally to make sure there's not some bad stuff in it.
[00:29:42.258 --> 00:29:43.800]  Now we talk about bad things going on.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:47.105]  Let's talk about the state of New York now.
[00:29:48.456 --> 00:29:51.639]  This is a very interesting sign of the times kind of deal.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:57.005]  Because you know in New York they're very strict when it comes to weapons regulation.
[00:29:57.025 --> 00:29:58.126]  But now we see this article.
[00:29:58.626 --> 00:30:00.228]  Stabbing surge stumps.
[00:30:00.568 --> 00:30:03.731]  NYC police sows fear among the residents.
[00:30:04.372 --> 00:30:09.876]  New York City has seen a 20% increase in stabbings this year compared with last.
[00:30:10.357 --> 00:30:14.019]  Police say they don't understand why it's happening or what to do about it.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:20.925]  While most of the attacks are part of domestic disputes at homes, random assaults without apparent motives are on the rise.
[00:30:21.065 --> 00:30:23.987]  As of March 13th, police recorded 809 incidents, up from 673 last year.
[00:30:24.007 --> 00:30:26.369]  I'd be shocked if they had 673 incidents over an entire year.
[00:30:33.294 --> 00:30:39.679]  They're reporting, you know, in the first three months of 2015, they had 673 last year.
[00:30:39.699 --> 00:30:46.864]  That's a lot of stabbings and slashings, and I'm pretty sure there are liberals out there that are saying, well, the next logical thing to do is to have knife control.
[00:30:47.881 --> 00:30:48.641]  You can ban knives.
[00:30:49.121 --> 00:30:50.302]  You can ban baseball bats.
[00:30:50.322 --> 00:30:51.582]  You can ban brass knuckles.
[00:30:51.602 --> 00:30:57.384]  You can ban pointy rocks and bow and arrows and sticks and stones and all the other stuff.
[00:30:57.724 --> 00:31:02.405]  The issue is you're not getting to the root cause of why these people are fighting each other in the first place.
[00:31:02.725 --> 00:31:04.726]  I'd imagine many of these are gang assaults.
[00:31:05.006 --> 00:31:11.488]  There's actually complete documentaries, I'm sure you can find them on YouTube, about guys getting, I think they call it the Buck 50, a gang initiation.
[00:31:11.508 --> 00:31:13.989]  They slash your face to try to give you 150 stitches.
[00:31:14.369 --> 00:31:17.150]  Also the domestic dispute for any number of reasons.
[00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:22.612]  Banning weapons doesn't change the fact that people want to go out and commit violent assaults.
[00:31:22.652 --> 00:31:29.894]  You gotta just remember that next time you go into New York, yeah, banning a bunch of other weapons didn't stop people from getting stabbed and slashed.
[00:31:30.934 --> 00:31:38.917]  Another thing, a sign of the times, for all you kids out there fighting for your $15 an hour, I understand you probably have a job that sucks and all that stuff, but look at this.
[00:31:39.457 --> 00:31:40.117]  Carl's Jr.
[00:31:40.137 --> 00:31:45.199]  CEO wants to try to put automated restaurants where customers never see a person.
[00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:56.102]  It says we could have a restaurant that is focused on all natural products, where you order it at a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person, Carl's Jr.
[00:31:56.142 --> 00:31:58.542]  CEO told Business Insider.
[00:31:59.043 --> 00:32:00.343]  So, think about this.
[00:32:00.723 --> 00:32:01.965]  Your account has been charged.
[00:32:02.245 --> 00:32:03.767]  Your balance is zero.
[00:32:04.287 --> 00:32:07.191]  Please come back when you can afford to make a purchase.
[00:32:07.271 --> 00:32:08.893]  I'm sorry you're having trouble.
[00:32:09.414 --> 00:32:10.775]  Your kids are starving.
[00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:11.897]  Carl's Jr.
[00:32:11.937 --> 00:32:13.899]  believes no child should go hungry.
[00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:15.501]  You are an unfit mother.
[00:32:16.122 --> 00:32:18.424]  Your children will be placed in the custody of Carl's Jr.
[00:32:19.624 --> 00:32:24.350]  Back in the day, I pushed grocery carts and sacked groceries for less than $6 an hour.
[00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:27.553]  And it sucked, and it was hot in the Oklahoma summer and all this other stuff.
[00:32:27.573 --> 00:32:30.717]  But I came to this realization that I didn't want to do this for the rest of my life.
[00:32:30.997 --> 00:32:32.739]  My manager made like $12 an hour.
[00:32:32.759 --> 00:32:34.060]  I was like, I don't want to make $12 an hour.
[00:32:34.801 --> 00:32:38.304]  When I'm 30 years old, what do I need to do to get out of this situation?
[00:32:38.344 --> 00:32:39.785]  You guys need to start doing the same thing.
[00:32:39.805 --> 00:32:44.349]  I don't really see how the Fight for $15 is really going to help people all that much.
[00:32:44.369 --> 00:32:45.630]  You need to try to get a better job.
[00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:53.216]  And finally, very quickly, Obama is seeking a presidential post-presidency payment, which means he wants more money once he leaves office.
[00:32:53.617 --> 00:32:54.698]  This is it for this segment.
[00:32:54.718 --> 00:32:57.220]  Stay tuned right after this for more special reports.
[00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.791]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:33:04.131 --> 00:33:07.673]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:33:07.933 --> 00:33:10.555]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:33:10.875 --> 00:33:14.297]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:33:14.517 --> 00:33:18.199]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts.

[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:47.821]  We're good.
[00:34:02.122 --> 00:34:08.204]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:34:08.224 --> 00:34:11.526]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:34:11.546 --> 00:34:13.286]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:34:13.326 --> 00:34:19.589]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:34:19.689 --> 00:34:25.611]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:34:25.751 --> 00:34:29.514]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:34:29.694 --> 00:34:32.637]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:34:32.777 --> 00:34:40.803]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:34:41.064 --> 00:34:43.105]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:34:43.145 --> 00:34:44.286]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:34:44.566 --> 00:34:46.248]  It's more vital than ever.
[00:34:46.408 --> 00:34:46.888]  I'm good to go.
[00:35:01.975 --> 00:35:11.245]  Infowarslife and Infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.

[00:35:36.122 --> 00:35:40.824]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system.
[00:35:40.984 --> 00:35:41.885]  That is like no other.

[00:37:05.327 --> 00:37:13.389]  Rob Dew with Infowars.com and we are at South by Southwest Interactive Festival and today I was going out with Joe Biggs to do some man on the streets and he showed me a post.
[00:37:13.709 --> 00:37:15.050]  This is Jade Lovell, by the way.
[00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.911]  She was running a speech today about Psywars.
[00:37:18.151 --> 00:37:22.272]  Why don't you tell people about what Psywars is all about and your show and why you do what you do.
[00:37:22.472 --> 00:37:33.375]  Yeah, so I'm a scientist by training and I got really frustrated when people couldn't understand science and would sometimes argue against what we know to be good science, particularly for things like climate change.
[00:37:34.096 --> 00:37:39.257]  No matter what you feel about climate change on an economic level, climate change, the science is in.
[00:37:39.577 --> 00:37:49.720]  So we're trying to bring, break down some of this really complicated science behind stuff and explain a lot of the public policy decisions that we make are based on science, so making sure that people are well informed.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.121]  Same as what you do, making sure people are well informed.
[00:37:52.341 --> 00:37:52.701]  Exactly.
[00:37:52.741 --> 00:37:54.082]  Let's start with climate change.
[00:37:54.122 --> 00:37:55.423]  So you picked the first topic.
[00:37:55.904 --> 00:37:56.324]  Here we go.
[00:37:56.364 --> 00:38:05.391]  So the Greenland ice cores show that the temperature of the planet used to be a lot warmer and a lot colder long before SUVs existed, long before cold power plants existed.
[00:38:05.411 --> 00:38:06.692]  Absolutely.
[00:38:07.629 --> 00:38:18.915]  You could say maybe humans are causing an insignificant amount of climate change, but the money it'll take to reverse whatever they're doing is going to cost way more than what it would do if we just work on processes to get out of that.
[00:38:18.995 --> 00:38:19.675]  What do you say to that?
[00:38:19.835 --> 00:38:20.075]  Great.
[00:38:20.195 --> 00:38:21.196]  There's two points there.
[00:38:21.616 --> 00:38:24.277]  One is, are humans actually causing climate change?
[00:38:24.337 --> 00:38:26.118]  Are we causing the climate to change more than it would have?
[00:38:26.619 --> 00:38:35.303]  And overwhelmingly, the science is in that yes, the climate is changing much faster than it ever has before, even when it was colder and even when it was hotter.
[00:38:35.643 --> 00:38:45.425]  So, you're talking about how it was colder and it was hotter, and that's true, but those changes happened over tens of thousands of years before humans were where we are now at the top of the food chain.
[00:38:45.745 --> 00:38:47.505]  So, yes, the climate did change in the past.
[00:38:47.745 --> 00:38:55.647]  It would have been catastrophic if humans had been alive, and the climate change we're seeing now, it's happening on a much faster scale, hundreds of thousands of times faster.
[00:38:55.967 --> 00:38:58.107]  So, absolutely, humans are causing climate change.
[00:38:58.687 --> 00:39:00.808]  What should we do about it is a great question.
[00:39:01.908 --> 00:39:04.430]  The economic argument is an interesting one.
[00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:07.391]  Do we want to keep the climate the way it is?
[00:39:07.771 --> 00:39:12.134]  Or can we afford to let climate change happen and just keep our economic policies the way they are?
[00:39:12.854 --> 00:39:24.800]  My opinion is that the amount of money it's going to cost us when the coast of North America starts to flood is going to be a lot more money to fix that than to stop and fix something here.
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.361]  It's like a stitch in time saves nine.
[00:39:26.801 --> 00:39:35.485]  If we do invest now, some people will have to pay an economic burden, but how much it's going to save us is like tens or hundreds of times more.
[00:39:35.905 --> 00:39:38.026]  That's my opinion, but it's the future, so who knows?
[00:39:38.286 --> 00:39:38.766]  Who knows?
[00:39:39.666 --> 00:39:48.470]  Or if half of Greenland and half of West Antarctica broke up and melted, this is what would happen to the sea level in Florida.
[00:39:54.072 --> 00:39:56.373]  This is what would happen to San Francisco Bay.
[00:39:58.772 --> 00:40:00.713]  A lot of people live in these areas.
[00:40:00.993 --> 00:40:03.074]  But this is what would happen to Manhattan.
[00:40:08.976 --> 00:40:17.160]  They can measure this precisely, just as the scientists could predict precisely how much water would breach the levees in New Orleans.
[00:40:18.112 --> 00:40:19.233]  Well, Al Gore seems to know.
[00:40:19.293 --> 00:40:25.997]  He doesn't seem to think that it's going to flood because he actually bought a house on the coast of California, so he's not too concerned about rising sea levels.
[00:40:26.157 --> 00:40:26.417]  Yeah.
[00:40:26.917 --> 00:40:28.738]  But I would like to ask you this question.
[00:40:29.519 --> 00:40:31.380]  What do trees breathe?
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.281]  Trees breathe carbon dioxide.
[00:40:33.641 --> 00:40:34.342]  What do we put out?
[00:40:34.862 --> 00:40:36.023]  We put out carbon dioxide.
[00:40:36.593 --> 00:40:42.399]  So, more humans on the planet would be breathing out more carbon dioxide, which would make trees breathe more carbon dioxide.
[00:40:42.419 --> 00:40:44.722]  They would take that carbon dioxide in and then turn it into oxygen.
[00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:45.663]  You don't agree with that?
[00:40:45.843 --> 00:40:50.668]  Trees do breathe carbon dioxide, but why does more carbon dioxide mean that trees breathe faster?
[00:40:50.708 --> 00:40:52.550]  If there's more oxygen, I don't breathe faster.
[00:40:52.870 --> 00:41:01.297]  They've actually proven that when trees breathe more, or when trees take in more carbon dioxide, they grow faster, which would then make them take in more carbon dioxide.
[00:41:01.317 --> 00:41:01.477]  Yeah.
[00:41:01.897 --> 00:41:03.979]  I haven't seen anything to suggest that.
[00:41:04.179 --> 00:41:06.281]  I would be really interested to know where you got your study from.
[00:41:06.701 --> 00:41:13.827]  And no one, no science anywhere is suggesting that trees are going to be able to keep up with the rate of carbon dioxide that we're releasing into the world.
[00:41:14.558 --> 00:41:21.468]  It came out I think last week or the week before in the Guardian, I believe, and it was Noah is fudging some of the numbers with these temperature increases.
[00:41:21.828 --> 00:41:22.950]  They were fudging the numbers.
[00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.151]  This isn't really happening.
[00:41:24.171 --> 00:41:25.954]  It's not rising as fast as they say it is.
[00:41:26.294 --> 00:41:28.217]  So how do we know people are telling us the truth?
[00:41:28.477 --> 00:41:28.857]  That's great.
[00:41:29.338 --> 00:41:29.578]  Point.
[00:41:29.879 --> 00:41:32.961]  People on both sides of the debate will say, like, you're fudging the numbers.
[00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:38.325]  So people who are pro-climate change will tell the people that are anti-climate change they are fudging the numbers and the reverse happens.
[00:41:38.786 --> 00:41:48.293]  So on both sides, I think whatever side of the climate change debate you're on, it doesn't matter if you come at it from a point of they're lying, we're never going to get to the truth.
[00:41:48.554 --> 00:41:50.956]  I don't really care if climate change is happening or not.
[00:41:51.116 --> 00:41:51.956]  I just want to know the truth.
[00:41:52.817 --> 00:42:01.660]  And so if we want to know the truth, like your viewers, it's better to look at what the overwhelming majority of evidence says, rather than cherry-picking case-by-case basis.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.740]  And that happens on both sides of the debate.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:04.261]  All right.
[00:42:04.601 --> 00:42:14.824]  Well, to me it looks like the people who are pushing for climate change, man-made climate change, are also prescribing a carbon tax, a global tax system, where they can come in and control and
[00:42:17.245 --> 00:42:26.992]  Yeah, that's a really great question.
[00:42:27.232 --> 00:42:30.375]  I think we have to be really careful on things like a carbon tax.
[00:42:30.635 --> 00:42:32.296]  I'm from Australia, and we had a carbon tax.
[00:42:32.316 --> 00:42:39.822]  We were one of the first countries to have one, but it was so unpopular because it was so badly designed that it was overturned, and now we don't have a carbon tax.
[00:42:39.882 --> 00:42:41.603]  Do you think it was designed that way on purpose?
[00:42:42.133 --> 00:42:43.033]  To be overturned?
[00:42:43.313 --> 00:42:44.934]  No, to be bad and not really work.
[00:42:45.354 --> 00:42:59.079]  I think it was designed by a government that was very progressive and liberal-minded, and they went a little bit too far on the side of, like, taking, like, increasing taxes and making choices for people.
[00:42:59.179 --> 00:43:03.520]  I'm a libertarian, so I believe that most of the time people are pretty smart about their decisions.
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.461]  The role of government should never be overstepped.
[00:43:06.832 --> 00:43:07.112]  Okay.
[00:43:07.372 --> 00:43:08.652]  You also talk about vaccines, right?
[00:43:09.172 --> 00:43:09.453]  I do.
[00:43:09.693 --> 00:43:10.033]  All right.
[00:43:10.353 --> 00:43:11.213]  One of my favorite subjects.
[00:43:11.593 --> 00:43:16.674]  So being a libertarian, you would think people have the wherewithal to decide what they want to put in their bodies.
[00:43:16.854 --> 00:43:17.734]  Yeah, we have to make it.
[00:43:18.494 --> 00:43:22.655]  Some things I think are so dangerous that people just, there's no reason for them.
[00:43:22.895 --> 00:43:24.656]  So for example, the smallpox vaccine.
[00:43:25.056 --> 00:43:30.657]  I don't think that there is anyone ever that would suggest that not having smallpox in our lives is going to be a bad thing.
[00:43:30.957 --> 00:43:32.677]  That was clearly a good vaccine to have.
[00:43:33.057 --> 00:43:35.538]  But for things like influenza, did you have the flu shot?
[00:43:35.718 --> 00:43:35.958]  Never.
[00:43:36.298 --> 00:43:44.103]  I've never had the flu shot either, so we made a choice based on like how busy we are, how much money we have, and if we can be bothered, and the risk that we have on what's right for us.
[00:43:44.323 --> 00:43:51.408]  So there's milder diseases where I think we should have a choice, and then there's really serious diseases like polio where I think we should all be vaccinated.
[00:43:51.428 --> 00:44:00.614]  Do you know there's people in India, like whole villages, that have been injected with the polio vaccine and then become crippled with polio-like symptoms, although they're not calling it polio.
[00:44:00.634 --> 00:44:01.475]  Are you aware of that?
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:06.483]  I haven't heard of that particular case study, but there is always a risk with any medical treatment.
[00:44:06.843 --> 00:44:10.806]  But if you had cancer, you'd probably want a doctor to go and help you and fix it.
[00:44:11.126 --> 00:44:19.431]  I believe that the risk of negative effect from most vaccines is so low that it's better to have the vaccine.
[00:44:19.932 --> 00:44:25.195]  But in many cases, the risks are kind of, not 50-50, but somewhere where we should be able to make choices for ourselves.
[00:44:25.762 --> 00:44:30.366]  Well, what I don't like is that in California, they want to mandate that any kid want to go to school, take a vaccine.
[00:44:30.886 --> 00:44:33.988]  But then you have these companies that have unlimited immunity.
[00:44:34.168 --> 00:44:34.929]  They can't be sued.
[00:44:35.529 --> 00:44:39.232]  If you want, if you have a problem with a vaccine damaged child, you have to go to a special court.
[00:44:39.572 --> 00:44:41.814]  The vaccine companies don't even have to participate in that court.
[00:44:42.214 --> 00:44:46.578]  They just kind of sit back and let a three judge tribunal decide the fate over a kid.
[00:44:46.978 --> 00:44:50.401]  Now, if these things are so safe and effective, like they say, why do we have this?
[00:44:50.441 --> 00:44:54.744]  And do they have something like that in your country where the vaccine companies are immune to prosecution or being sued?
[00:44:54.824 --> 00:45:01.829]  I don't know about if they're immune, but I know that in Australia, where I'm from, as same as what's happening in California, it's a no, no jab, no play.
[00:45:02.029 --> 00:45:04.170]  Like if your kids aren't vaccinated, they can't go to a public school.
[00:45:04.551 --> 00:45:05.531]  But think about this.
[00:45:06.092 --> 00:45:11.295]  If you're a libertarian, then why are you arguing that you should have access to public services?
[00:45:11.435 --> 00:45:13.296]  Aren't you someone that believes in freedom of choice?
[00:45:13.436 --> 00:45:18.520]  And if you want to choose not to vaccinate your children, shouldn't you then also choose to go to an independent school?
[00:45:19.147 --> 00:45:23.090]  Well that would be great, but they take your property taxes and make you pay for public schools.
[00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:23.911]  This is true, you're right.
[00:45:24.291 --> 00:45:29.075]  So I think sometimes, why should they be sued?
[00:45:29.335 --> 00:45:31.597]  If they're negligent, I totally believe they should be sued.
[00:45:32.077 --> 00:45:35.760]  I don't think there's any time when we should be protecting organizations from accountability.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:39.083]  So I don't agree that we should have organizations that are above the law.
[00:45:39.548 --> 00:45:41.911]  So there you have it folks, a young Turk is agreeing with an Infowarrior.
[00:45:41.931 --> 00:45:43.072]  We can be friends.
[00:45:44.053 --> 00:45:44.854]  GMOs.
[00:45:45.135 --> 00:45:46.557]  I bet you've been talking a lot about GMOs.
[00:45:46.957 --> 00:45:53.905]  There was actually, it just came out today, they're finding traces of pesticide in like some of the major German beers and it's glyphosate.
[00:45:54.286 --> 00:45:57.990]  Now you've got the EU saying glyphosate is bad, the WHO is saying glyphosate is bad.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.621]  They seem to be, glyphosate is good, more glyphosate the better.
[00:46:02.041 --> 00:46:05.222]  Everywhere, they spray it on the lawns, they put it on the food, they want you to eat it.
[00:46:06.042 --> 00:46:07.123]  What is wrong with glyphosate?
[00:46:07.463 --> 00:46:12.585]  So glyphosate is actually one of the less toxic pesticides that we use.
[00:46:12.625 --> 00:46:14.666]  There are a lot of really, really bad toxins.
[00:46:15.106 --> 00:46:18.027]  Glyphosate, and I've got a whole video about this topic, exactly.
[00:46:18.627 --> 00:46:22.969]  Glyphosate is one of the less toxic ones, but it's still something that we shouldn't be drinking gallons of.
[00:46:23.289 --> 00:46:27.370]  It's an interesting case that the United States has a much more libertarian view on toxins.
[00:46:38.196 --> 00:46:40.397]  Here I'll just do a tag out here and we'll finish it up.
[00:46:40.677 --> 00:46:41.298]  You still rolling?
[00:46:41.318 --> 00:46:45.060]  All right we've been asked to leave so we're gonna go downstairs and finish up this interview.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:45.740]  What?
[00:46:49.322 --> 00:46:50.502]  So we've been asked to leave.
[00:46:50.643 --> 00:46:53.344]  The really nice people from South by Southwest are like
[00:46:54.244 --> 00:46:57.027]  We know this is film and interactive, but don't film here.
[00:46:57.628 --> 00:46:59.029]  Don't film where there's film.
[00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:01.492]  It's a film festival, so we don't want any filming going on.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:05.094 --> 00:49:12.657]  At this ceremony at Oslo City Hall, President Barack Obama joined the exalted company of Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa.
[00:49:13.077 --> 00:49:16.739]  He was cited for re-engaging America in global diplomacy.
[00:49:17.119 --> 00:49:22.501]  Yet his peace prize came days after he ordered thousands more troops to war in Afghanistan.
[00:49:22.821 --> 00:49:24.002]  The enemy is all
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:37.281]  About hiding their crimes in plain view and being incredibly, incredibly, incredibly outrageous.
[00:49:37.401 --> 00:49:41.362]  And then we just sit there and take it like frogs in the proverbial pot.
[00:49:41.422 --> 00:49:45.703]  It's time to pull our own stunts to expose what they're doing.
[00:49:46.003 --> 00:49:48.423]  And one stunt won't save the world, but a million might.
[00:49:49.784 --> 00:49:52.384]  Throwing it back in their face, showing what frauds they are.
[00:49:52.924 --> 00:49:56.705]  Barack Obama, this is a conservative number, we broke it down, we're doing a story on it today.
[00:49:57.972 --> 00:50:00.374]  Wars that he's helped launch or support have killed 995,000.
[00:50:00.754 --> 00:50:09.180]  They can always say both sides contribute, but the person that starts it under the Geneva Convention in history is the one behind it.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:15.665]  And nobody has pushed this more and given cover to war like it's some humanitarian thing than Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:50:16.666 --> 00:50:19.928]  I have decided to give Barack Obama a Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:50:19.948 --> 00:50:22.650]  He's already been given one before he was even president for doing nothing.
[00:50:24.215 --> 00:50:30.437]  And so we are now giving, and there's one candle for every 100,000 people he has directly contributed to killing.
[00:50:30.477 --> 00:50:33.138]  And you know, Obama says he's really good at killing people.
[00:50:33.178 --> 00:50:34.878]  Let's pull that clip up in a few minutes.
[00:50:35.078 --> 00:50:36.018]  Come on in, Leanne.
[00:50:36.078 --> 00:50:36.799]  Come on in, ladies.
[00:50:37.679 --> 00:50:40.540]  And so we're going to celebrate with the president his mass murder.
[00:50:41.385 --> 00:50:43.826]  I know that's obscene, but we're being satirical here.
[00:50:44.586 --> 00:50:46.407]  The media acts like it's no big deal.
[00:50:46.427 --> 00:50:50.728]  Madeleine Albright said 500,000 dead Iraqi children is a good price to pay.
[00:50:50.768 --> 00:50:51.569]  Bush was part of that.
[00:50:51.949 --> 00:50:52.949]  But the Democrats were involved.
[00:50:52.989 --> 00:50:53.689]  Clinton was involved.
[00:50:53.709 --> 00:50:54.810]  She said it's a good price to pay.
[00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:55.890]  Remember that?
[00:50:55.950 --> 00:51:00.752]  So, hey, let's bring them a delicious cake here.
[00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:02.472]  Ladies, thank you.
[00:51:02.512 --> 00:51:04.193]  You can just set it right there by the microphone over there.
[00:51:04.233 --> 00:51:04.553]  Thank you.
[00:51:05.593 --> 00:51:07.594]  And you guys did a great job coming up with the graphics.
[00:51:07.934 --> 00:51:10.055]  In fact, I believe you did the graphics for this, correct?
[00:51:11.158 --> 00:51:12.739]  All right, well, all right, well, fantastic.
[00:51:13.079 --> 00:51:14.019]  All right, well, fantastic.
[00:51:14.059 --> 00:51:15.540]  Now, here we are.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.880]  We have the Nobel Prize.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:20.061]  This is made by the guy that invented dynamite, or nitroglycerin.
[00:51:20.822 --> 00:51:25.343]  And so he said he felt bad about war, so he gave hundreds of millions of dollars at that time to the Nobel Prize.
[00:51:25.363 --> 00:51:29.405]  They've given some good people the Nobel Prize, but now it's a true joke to get it.
[00:51:29.485 --> 00:51:32.366]  So, also want to give him not just the new Nobel Prize,
[00:51:33.462 --> 00:51:43.407]  But I want to give him this plastic bling, you know, dollar sign OG situation because, again, it's all about celebrating the fraud.
[00:51:43.647 --> 00:51:44.968]  It's not real gold, but it doesn't matter.
[00:51:44.988 --> 00:51:45.668]  I'll just say it is.
[00:51:45.688 --> 00:51:48.229]  Just like he's not a man of peace, but we'll just say he is.
[00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:53.752]  And so here it is, a new Nobel Prize for Obama and the staff here.
[00:51:54.473 --> 00:51:57.374]  You know, we're all just going to have a piece of the cake.
[00:51:58.074 --> 00:51:59.295]  Hey, here's Obama!
[00:52:00.195 --> 00:52:01.156]  Yeah, Obama!
[00:52:02.122 --> 00:52:06.365]  Man, only 375,000 more Iraqis have died since Obama took over.
[00:52:06.685 --> 00:52:08.026]  Hundreds of thousands of Afghans.
[00:52:08.707 --> 00:52:10.728]  Hundreds of thousands in Syria, Libya.
[00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:12.229]  It's over 400,000 now.
[00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:14.191]  I kept saying 300,000 in Syria.
[00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:17.433]  And our government, with NATO, helped start the whole thing.
[00:52:17.453 --> 00:52:21.376]  So I brought some of the crew in, whoever wanted a piece of this cake.
[00:52:21.876 --> 00:52:25.059]  Leanne, will you sit down by the microphone here, please, and tell folks...
[00:52:27.136 --> 00:52:30.077]  What this says here for Radio Lister's, we have to narrate for them.
[00:52:30.097 --> 00:52:31.518]  It's got a Nobel Prize there.
[00:52:31.558 --> 00:52:32.899]  It's the President's Nobel Prize.
[00:52:32.919 --> 00:52:40.743]  The Lister's take here with his second Nobel Peace Prize for being a man of peace to the King, Obama, we love you.
[00:52:40.763 --> 00:52:42.944]  You're so good at killing people.
[00:52:42.964 --> 00:52:44.524]  Almost a million.
[00:52:44.844 --> 00:52:46.265]  Yeah, almost there.
[00:52:46.545 --> 00:52:47.206]  Almost a million.
[00:52:47.246 --> 00:52:48.666]  We wanted to put that extra candle in.
[00:52:48.686 --> 00:52:49.647]  It probably is a million, too.
[00:52:49.867 --> 00:52:51.208]  Exactly, that's old numbers, Rob.
[00:52:51.228 --> 00:52:52.028]  From that we know.
[00:52:52.048 --> 00:52:54.009]  So here's to killing a million people.
[00:52:58.747 --> 00:53:00.431]  Let's give him another Nobel Prize.
[00:53:00.451 --> 00:53:01.554]  Community organizer.
[00:53:01.595 --> 00:53:02.437]  And I'm giving him this one.
[00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:05.452]  What are we going to call this, the original gangster price?
[00:53:06.012 --> 00:53:06.433]  OG?
[00:53:06.673 --> 00:53:08.595]  This is for being really good at killing people.
[00:53:09.756 --> 00:53:10.897]  Because it is all a joke.
[00:53:10.957 --> 00:53:12.539]  The Nobel Prize is a joke.
[00:53:13.219 --> 00:53:16.383]  It's all a joke, so anybody that wants to get on that mic and make comments... Can he get the Nobel Prize?
[00:53:16.403 --> 00:53:20.687]  I mean, right when he was elected, he didn't even do anything, and he got the Nobel Prize.
[00:53:20.787 --> 00:53:23.870]  And then he ended up killing a million, almost a million people.
[00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:25.772]  But listen, I... So he deserves another one.
[00:53:25.892 --> 00:53:26.793]  I get a Nobel Prize.
[00:53:28.277 --> 00:53:29.098]  Everybody gets one.
[00:53:29.518 --> 00:53:30.699]  They're just passing it off to everybody.
[00:53:31.079 --> 00:53:31.559]  I deserve it.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:32.600]  I just think it's amazing.
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:39.165]  The number of troops killed in Afghanistan is 75% of the total troop deaths since Obama took office.
[00:53:39.225 --> 00:53:39.906]  You know what I want?
[00:53:40.126 --> 00:53:47.131]  I want to nominate Hitler for a Nobel Peace Prize, Stalin, Mao, Genghis Khan, and Fidel Castro while we're at it.
[00:53:47.151 --> 00:53:47.711]  I mean, why not?
[00:53:47.751 --> 00:53:48.072]  Why not?
[00:53:48.232 --> 00:53:49.032]  How about Pol Pot?
[00:53:49.613 --> 00:53:50.053]  David Knight?
[00:53:50.413 --> 00:53:50.754]  McBrain?
[00:53:51.494 --> 00:53:52.174]  Josh?
[00:53:52.354 --> 00:53:58.116]  Let me just say, only in today's Orwellian society would someone like Obama get a Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:53:58.917 --> 00:53:59.637]  For doing nothing.
[00:53:59.957 --> 00:54:01.938]  I mean, outrageously, he got it.
[00:54:02.998 --> 00:54:04.679]  Who is this guy?
[00:54:04.759 --> 00:54:06.039]  Now he gets the Nobel Peace Prize?
[00:54:06.279 --> 00:54:08.220]  I'm giving him this for making our economy the best it's ever been.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:08.860]  Remember he said that?
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:10.381]  Our economy is the best it's ever been.
[00:54:10.541 --> 00:54:10.721]  Yes.
[00:54:11.547 --> 00:54:17.389]  Well, and along that line, Alex, there's been a million people who've lost their jobs since NAFTA.
[00:54:17.529 --> 00:54:19.670]  Of course, we can't blame that on Obama.
[00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:21.951]  He campaigned, said he was going to get rid of NAFTA.
[00:54:21.991 --> 00:54:23.151]  That's a bipartisan effort.
[00:54:23.171 --> 00:54:30.074]  So I guess when he accepts this, then he needs to give some credit to the people who helped him and the GOP as well, the establishment leaders.
[00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:33.535]  I wonder if he will accept our Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:54:35.447 --> 00:54:39.088]  It's a joke they gave him the prize, and we're not really joking about all these dead people.
[00:54:39.768 --> 00:54:44.469]  It's horrible, but the American people seem to think it's like another planet over there that this is happening.
[00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:52.092]  Our government put the jihadis in, and now 400-plus thousand people, according to Lancet and others, have died in Syria.
[00:54:52.172 --> 00:54:53.612]  No one was dying before this happened.
[00:54:53.632 --> 00:54:54.512]  They try to blame Assad.
[00:54:54.732 --> 00:54:59.313]  They admit the vast majority are al-Qaeda and ISIS-killing people, including the genocide of Christians.
[00:54:59.333 --> 00:55:00.134]  The Christians, yeah.
[00:55:01.354 --> 00:55:05.876]  Has killed over 170,000 Christians and Shiites since, and that's just in Iraq too.
[00:55:05.916 --> 00:55:10.338]  That's not even the other countries because they don't even know the numbers in the other countries because just the way things are.
[00:55:10.418 --> 00:55:17.601]  Our government with Saudi Arabia has financed and aided and armed a Sunni jihad to take over the entire region.
[00:55:17.621 --> 00:55:18.622]  Joe Biggs, why do you think they're doing that?
[00:55:19.266 --> 00:55:20.306]  I'm going to run the mic back over there.
[00:55:20.646 --> 00:55:28.048]  I mean, yesterday I went out and did a video of a man on the street out at South by Southwest asking people who hates Muslims more, Obama, Clinton, or Trump.
[00:55:28.428 --> 00:55:35.330]  And everyone automatically just said Trump, completely ignoring the fact that Donald Trump opposed both wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:40.311]  And also I brought up the fact of the drone kills by Obama, how they've gone up since he's been in office.
[00:55:40.331 --> 00:55:40.711]  Land!
[00:55:40.731 --> 00:55:42.471]  Those are just like children.
[00:55:42.531 --> 00:55:43.791]  Each one's 100,000 kids.
[00:55:43.811 --> 00:55:46.472]  They just blow them out like it's no big deal.
[00:55:54.028 --> 00:56:03.419]  Last week, LiveTrucking.com posted this clip of Bernie Sanders bragging about new innovations in rail technology that will take big rigs off the road.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:09.106]  We can create a state-of-the-art rail system which takes trucks off the road.
[00:56:10.762 --> 00:56:19.465]  The article from early March, Bernie Sanders promises to take trucks off the road if elected, poses the question, is it political rhetoric being used to excite uninformed followers?
[00:56:19.765 --> 00:56:23.966]  Or will the trucking industry be significantly downsized under a Sanders presidency?
[00:56:24.206 --> 00:56:31.108]  Most Sanders critics focus on his socialist domestic economic plan, and Bernie makes no secret that he intends to raise taxes on everyone.
[00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:35.649]  Yes, we are going to ask Trump and his billionaire friends to pay more in taxes.
[00:56:35.769 --> 00:56:37.410]  Yes, we are going to end these
[00:56:38.413 --> 00:56:42.034]  We'll come up with that rate, but it'll be a damn lot higher than it is right now.
[00:56:42.535 --> 00:56:47.156]  American billionaire's taxes will be, to quote Bernie, a damn lot higher than it is now.
[00:56:47.436 --> 00:56:50.558]  To some, the idea of taxing billionaires is a long time coming.
[00:56:50.698 --> 00:56:54.019]  But in reality, it seems like everyone will be feeling the burn.
[00:56:54.159 --> 00:56:57.560]  When a mom gives birth, she doesn't have to go back to work in two weeks.
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:01.122]  So if there's an illness in the family, dad or mom can stay home with the kids.
[00:57:01.642 --> 00:57:04.663]  That will require a small increase in the payroll tax.
[00:57:05.262 --> 00:57:09.243]  Now, let's look at the results of other socialist utopias around the world.
[00:57:09.603 --> 00:57:17.525]  In October 2015, Rich Lowry wrote an article published in the New York Post, Sorry Bernie, Scandinavia is no socialist paradise after all.
[00:57:18.026 --> 00:57:23.507]  In it he documents, In Sweden, the effective marginal tax rate topped 100% in some circumstances.
[00:57:23.807 --> 00:57:27.848]  There is a reason that the IKEA founder, Ingvar Kamprad, fled the country in 1973.
[00:57:28.209 --> 00:57:33.250]  The article continues, The socialist golden years weren't so golden for economic performance.
[00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:36.891]  Entrepreneurship plummeted, job creation and wages sputtered.
[00:57:37.251 --> 00:57:43.574]  So when the taxes for billionaires go a damn lot higher than it is now, billionaires and the jobs they provide will leave.
[00:57:43.894 --> 00:57:48.975]  Yet on top of Bernie's socialist programs, there are the draconian environmental policies he is proposing.
[00:57:49.276 --> 00:57:53.397]  Carbon taxes and carbon offsets are a centerpiece of the earth worship religion.
[00:57:53.737 --> 00:58:01.820]  In addition, to attain this pious plateau, societies must build vast collectivist infrastructures, such as light rail, robotic factories, and autonomous cars.
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:02.440]  We're good to go.
[00:58:19.727 --> 00:58:27.929]  In addition to destroying these good-paying jobs, a rail trucking system would allow bureaucrats to divert and block essential goods and services with relative ease.
[00:58:28.369 --> 00:58:34.610]  The statement made by Sanders and others like him is just a small glimpse into what this new slave utopia will look like.
[00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:40.632]  As LiveTrucking.com reports, several drivers immediately contacted us expressing concern over the statements.
[00:58:41.012 --> 00:58:43.152]  This guy has to be stopped, said one reader.
[00:58:43.512 --> 00:58:46.273]  Seems like some of us are not quite ready to feel the burn.
[00:58:46.613 --> 00:58:50.075]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
