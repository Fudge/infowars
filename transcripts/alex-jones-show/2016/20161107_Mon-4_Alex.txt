[00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.770]  But, if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.411]  We came, we saw, we died.
[00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:09.532]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:00:10.172 --> 00:00:13.653]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:21.736]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:24.121]  The U.S.
[00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:27.784]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:35.750]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:38.472]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:41.715]  Of course not, because she's... There's a really loud noise.
[00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:47.219]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.441]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:00:53.277 --> 00:00:57.707]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:01:38.305 --> 00:01:42.468]  Alright, good morning everybody out there listening to the sound of my voice.
[00:01:42.488 --> 00:01:43.869]  This is Rob Doo reporting.
[00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:49.088]  And we are deep into the 52-hour broadcast here at the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:01:49.528 --> 00:01:50.268]  52 hours live.
[00:01:50.328 --> 00:01:52.089]  In fact, we did not take a break.
[00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:57.692]  We actually had set up a system where we could play videos for a couple hours and give some of the people behind the board a break.
[00:01:58.412 --> 00:02:02.914]  And Owen Troyer, the Cook Destroyer, just kept going on and on.
[00:02:02.994 --> 00:02:11.298]  And kudos to Marcos and Ashley out there for staying true and keeping it going, keeping the mid-light lamp burning.
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.241]  I am Rob Dew.
[00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:15.902]  You can follow me on Twitter at DewsNews.
[00:02:16.223 --> 00:02:17.323]  I'm going to go back to your calls.
[00:02:18.144 --> 00:02:19.845]  If you guys could pull this up on screen.
[00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:25.569]  Look at this outfit Lady Gaga wore last night for Hillary Clinton's rally.
[00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:26.369]  Can you all pull that up?
[00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:29.512]  Alright, it dropped again, didn't it?
[00:02:29.532 --> 00:02:30.893]  This is my luck.
[00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:35.976]  It did drop, didn't it?
[00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:39.759]  No, we don't know?
[00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:42.045]  I'm just going to fix it right here and there.
[00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:43.026]  I'm just going to make it work.
[00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:48.067]  No, nothing?
[00:02:49.147 --> 00:02:49.747]  You got it?
[00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:50.127]  I don't know.
[00:02:50.327 --> 00:02:51.348]  I mean, I'm trying to fix it.
[00:02:54.468 --> 00:02:55.248]  Alright, well.
[00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:56.949]  No, no, no.
[00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:57.769]  We'll just go to this.
[00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.790]  Y'all can pull up this Daily Mail article.
[00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.770]  It has pictures in it.
[00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.250]  Here's a picture.
[00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.912]  She kind of looks like she's cross-dressing as Michael Jackson meets a Nazi collaborator.
[00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:12.225]  Go to the overhead cam.
[00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:12.725]  Does that work?
[00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:13.425]  We get that?
[00:03:16.586 --> 00:03:20.067]  Every time I try to go to this screen, it decides it has to crap out.
[00:03:20.327 --> 00:03:21.027]  Did it work this time?
[00:03:21.207 --> 00:03:21.567]  Here we go.
[00:03:21.907 --> 00:03:22.767]  Here's the Daily Minotaur.
[00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:24.708]  Hillary shows Donald who's the boss.
[00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:30.709]  Clinton bests Trump with her celebrity haul on final night with Lady Gaga, Bon Jovi, and Bruce Springsteen.
[00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:33.809]  These people probably don't pay too much in taxes either.
[00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.290]  Here's the shot of Lady Gaga and Watson
[00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.030]  Tweeted this out Lady Gaga.
[00:03:39.050 --> 00:04:06.417]  This is not disconcerting at all shows a Nazi uniform and Lady Gaga and then doing the Nazi hand pose right there a little salute and So very interesting that she had all these people at her rally She's in Philadelphia right next to New Jersey, it's like just you just go over a bridge and you're in New Jersey And so you get Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi two guys from New Jersey
[00:04:07.952 --> 00:04:08.352]  To come out.
[00:04:08.432 --> 00:04:12.993]  Pretty much the heart and soul of New Jersey music, Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi.
[00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.974]  Like, you're not going to bring people out with that.
[00:04:19.015 --> 00:04:23.896]  And it was shown over and over again on the media, oh look, she's got such a huge crowd.
[00:04:23.916 --> 00:04:29.097]  Well, they had the president, they had the first lady, who are probably really liked in Philadelphia.
[00:04:29.117 --> 00:04:29.697]  I don't know why.
[00:04:31.286 --> 00:04:36.090]  They had Bill Clinton and Chelsea came out and they all looked so surprised that the crowd was there.
[00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:48.881]  They were pretty much blown away that there was a crowd at this event because we saw last week or just a couple days ago with LeBron James barely had 300 people in the city of Cleveland where he won a championship that year.
[00:04:48.901 --> 00:04:51.843]  So let's pull that up.
[00:04:51.883 --> 00:04:54.986]  Let's show her a little Nazi hand because they were so up on Trump.
[00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.300]  Oh, Trump's giving Nazi salutes.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.680]  Look at that.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.741]  There's Lady Gaga and people are eating it up.
[00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:08.965]  They want to be controlled by people like this, that dress up in these authoritarian uniforms and prance around and tell you how to live your life.
[00:05:09.965 --> 00:05:12.786]  See, she's going to tell you what's good for the earth, how to live your life.
[00:05:13.707 --> 00:05:14.807]  Anyway, Watson's awake.
[00:05:16.088 --> 00:05:17.348]  Watson, call in if you want.
[00:05:18.348 --> 00:05:20.089]  Tell me what's new, what's going on in England.
[00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.211]  And, you know, Comey, it took him what?
[00:05:25.913 --> 00:05:26.473]  How many days?
[00:05:26.553 --> 00:05:28.735]  Eight days to go through 650,000 emails?
[00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:32.216]  Here's another Daily Mail article.
[00:05:32.257 --> 00:05:33.097]  Now that's bad timing.
[00:05:33.217 --> 00:05:42.742]  FBI's Embattled Director James Comey accepts Lifetime Achievement Award from a law enforcement group with ties to Trump as he faces calls to resign over a Clinton email fiasco.
[00:05:42.782 --> 00:05:48.826]  They probably sent him that when he opened up the investigation and then he said, oh yeah, I'll accept this Lifetime Achievement Award.
[00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:57.111]  The group lists more than three dozen board members on his website, some of which include several people with longtime ties to Trump, including the CEO of the National Enquirer.
[00:05:57.131 --> 00:06:07.134]  An FBI spokesman for the foundation says it provides disability, bereavement, and personal crisis support to federal agents and educational charitable grants.
[00:06:08.527 --> 00:06:09.888]  Yeah, talk about bad timing.
[00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:18.156]  Because exclusive Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett has convinced President Obama to fire FBI Director James Comey after the election.
[00:06:18.557 --> 00:06:19.938]  Oh, that won't be political at all.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.105]  You know, he got pressured into reopening the investigation after what the NYPD found.
[00:06:28.906 --> 00:06:31.889]  And then after eight days just clears her.
[00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:33.230]  Says, nothing, nothing to see.
[00:06:34.062 --> 00:06:39.024]  So, Valerie Jarrett, who is, I think she's from Iran, and she's a Muslim, too.
[00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:43.046]  Well, she's a very interesting character, who's been Obama's Chief of Staff.
[00:06:43.947 --> 00:06:50.410]  Clinton emails found on Anthony Weiner's laptop can be made public, Federal Judge says, but it might take five years before all the documents are released.
[00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:51.530]  Only five years?
[00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:53.811]  She'll be out of her first term.
[00:06:53.831 --> 00:06:56.032]  Wow.
[00:06:57.453 --> 00:06:59.134]  So Judicial Watch is suing to get him.
[00:07:01.044 --> 00:07:01.465]  Of course.
[00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.688]  They're pretty good again, but they'll be redacted.
[00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:12.179]  Anything with any type of risque writing, anything implicating anyone will be redacted.
[00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:12.880]  We know that.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.122]  Now, I have
[00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:16.289]  One video clip.
[00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:21.332]  And if you guys have any others, if you could just send me a list of what we have, I'll gladly go to other video clips.
[00:07:21.752 --> 00:07:31.898]  But we're in the midst of our 52-hour broadcast, and before we go to the ultimate Hillary supporter, the person, the type of people you're going to be up against today in this election.
[00:07:33.859 --> 00:07:41.663]  And I don't want to, and I'm not picking on mentally challenged people, because I don't think this guy's mentally challenged.
[00:07:41.683 --> 00:07:44.865]  A lot of people criticize me for putting this video up, saying, oh, how could you put this up?
[00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:49.817]  I'm out there shooting this green parade that's going on.
[00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:51.378]  We're right at the start of it.
[00:07:52.298 --> 00:07:56.860]  And I just interviewed a girl holding one of the banner that was going to lead the parade.
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.461]  Just, you know, a few questions real quick.
[00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:02.202]  I turn around, I see a guy with a Hillary Clinton flag.
[00:08:02.702 --> 00:08:05.943]  The first Clinton supporter I'd seen since I got to Philly.
[00:08:05.983 --> 00:08:09.064]  This was for the Democratic National Convention back in July.
[00:08:10.265 --> 00:08:14.126]  And I walk over to him and he's got a Hillary hat on.
[00:08:15.384 --> 00:08:17.025]  And then I see he's wearing a Hillary shirt on it.
[00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:18.125]  It says, Yaz Queen.
[00:08:18.145 --> 00:08:19.185]  I don't even know what that means.
[00:08:20.026 --> 00:08:22.186]  But alright, well, I'm gonna interview this guy.
[00:08:23.107 --> 00:08:33.591]  I have found the ultimate Hillary supporter and he's here at this parade which is mainly made up of Bernie Sanders supporters and hardcore, probably even hardcore Greenies than Bernie Sanders.
[00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:38.592]  And so, I walk up to him and said, hey, you wanna answer some questions?
[00:08:38.612 --> 00:08:39.052]  He goes, sure.
[00:08:39.073 --> 00:08:42.534]  We go right into it and
[00:08:43.834 --> 00:08:47.300]  You know, at first people dismissed this guy, but then I went back and re-listened to it.
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:53.951]  But we're going to play the first 40 seconds, and you're going to hear his opening remarks, and then we'll finish the video.
[00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:55.113]  So let's roll it.
[00:08:57.242 --> 00:08:58.963]  Okay, so I'm here with a Hillary supporter.
[00:08:58.983 --> 00:09:01.283]  He's got a shirt that says, yes, Queen 2016.
[00:09:01.683 --> 00:09:03.244]  What's your name, sir?
[00:09:03.344 --> 00:09:05.965]  My name is Anthony Novotny from Havertown.
[00:09:06.305 --> 00:09:07.725]  I'm a Democratic leader.
[00:09:08.145 --> 00:09:13.807]  Greg McCally sent me down to volunteer for the Committee of Democrats for Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:19.090]  And I support the Democrats because John F. Kennedy inspired me to become a Democratic leader.
[00:09:19.631 --> 00:09:20.852]  I trust Hillary.
[00:09:21.552 --> 00:09:28.657]  I trust Hillary for leadership, dedication, honor, trust, dignity, loyal, trustworthy.
[00:09:29.077 --> 00:09:29.978]  Hillary's the best.
[00:09:30.398 --> 00:09:33.500]  I know when she becomes president, she'll be the best leader in the world.
[00:09:34.361 --> 00:09:35.081]  Go Hillary!
[00:09:35.442 --> 00:09:36.723]  Alright, there you go.
[00:09:36.763 --> 00:09:38.384]  That's just the first 40 seconds.
[00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:39.825]  I'm asking more questions.
[00:09:41.312 --> 00:09:41.552]  I don't know.
[00:10:12.034 --> 00:10:14.555]  We were somewhere downtown up here.
[00:10:17.156 --> 00:10:18.317]  You gotta love this system.
[00:10:19.037 --> 00:10:20.978]  Can we get something that just works?
[00:10:23.819 --> 00:10:24.739]  Plug, yeah.
[00:10:24.939 --> 00:10:26.580]  Here, what do we try?
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.821]  Oh yeah, the destination.
[00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:30.422]  Am I going to want the top one?
[00:10:38.507 --> 00:10:39.267]  We're gonna get it right.
[00:10:39.467 --> 00:10:40.648]  We're gonna defeat this computer.
[00:10:40.688 --> 00:10:42.408]  Probably needs to be restarted.
[00:10:44.229 --> 00:10:44.749]  I'm just saying.
[00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:45.309]  I don't know.
[00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.810]  Alright, so here's a map of Philadelphia.
[00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:49.811]  We're gonna get through this.
[00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:50.491]  I know it.
[00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:53.872]  We were up here somewhere right around downtown.
[00:10:54.512 --> 00:10:55.392]  Avertown's right over here.
[00:10:55.412 --> 00:10:56.373]  Look at that.
[00:10:56.533 --> 00:10:58.833]  So, you know, took a bus, whatever, to get down here.
[00:10:59.754 --> 00:11:01.694]  And he said Greg Vitale sent me.
[00:11:02.655 --> 00:11:06.756]  I'm going back, I'm like, could Greg Vitale be, you know, who's Greg Vitale?
[00:11:07.506 --> 00:11:14.334]  Oh, he happens to be a Pennsylvania State Rep, right there, Greg Vitale, in the same area that Anthony's from.
[00:11:14.354 --> 00:11:15.695]  So he probably helps out.
[00:11:16.496 --> 00:11:23.123]  Anthony probably goes to the office and helps out the staff there and they say, why don't you go to the convention?
[00:11:23.784 --> 00:11:25.065]  You could be one of our volunteers.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.520]  And this guy's happy to do it.
[00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:28.761]  You know, very happy.
[00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:33.703]  And so then, after, alright, this guy's ready to engage, let's talk.
[00:11:33.723 --> 00:11:39.045]  Because sometimes, Hillary supporters see the InfoWars flag, Mike Flag, and go, I don't want to talk to you.
[00:11:40.645 --> 00:11:45.007]  You saw, I triggered somebody in Wisconsin one time, they saw my Hillary for Prison sticker.
[00:11:45.027 --> 00:11:46.527]  At first they thought it was a Hillary sticker.
[00:11:46.547 --> 00:11:49.288]  It had Hillary for Prison on the back of my cell phone.
[00:11:49.729 --> 00:11:50.489]  And they get triggered.
[00:11:50.589 --> 00:11:51.789]  I don't want to talk to you now.
[00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.630]  Oh, why not?
[00:11:54.477 --> 00:11:55.338]  Defend your candidate.
[00:11:55.598 --> 00:11:56.999]  Tell me why Hillary shouldn't be in prison.
[00:11:57.619 --> 00:11:58.540]  No, don't want to do that.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.663]  So let's finish up, and then it goes, another guy sees me interviewing him and gets mad.
[00:12:03.683 --> 00:12:05.404]  Like, you're trying to make a fool out of him.
[00:12:05.504 --> 00:12:06.505]  I'm not trying to make a fool out of him.
[00:12:06.565 --> 00:12:08.406]  I'm asking him questions and he's giving me answers.
[00:12:08.787 --> 00:12:11.909]  And in no time did I ever say anything snide or snarky to the guy.
[00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:12.989]  I was very respectful.
[00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:13.850]  So let's roll the rest of that.
[00:12:14.582 --> 00:12:17.805]  Well, I believe that the Democratic Party, they know what they're doing.
[00:12:17.825 --> 00:12:18.746]  Hillary's a good leader.
[00:12:18.766 --> 00:12:19.447]  I trust Hillary.
[00:12:19.487 --> 00:12:20.548]  Hillary is a good leader.
[00:12:20.568 --> 00:12:26.493]  And I know when she becomes President of the United States, she'll be an outstanding leader for our country.
[00:12:38.244 --> 00:12:45.334]  I trust her for loyalty, leadership, trust, value, friendship, and God and country.
[00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:50.181]  So you think it's okay that they decided to select a candidate instead of letting the people's will decide?
[00:12:51.162 --> 00:12:52.822]  Yes sir, I agree with that.
[00:12:52.862 --> 00:12:59.404]  The government should allow Hillary Clinton to become President of the United States.
[00:13:00.804 --> 00:13:01.625]  One last question.
[00:13:02.345 --> 00:13:10.487]  What do you think about the emails scandal when the FBI director came out and said she had at least 110 classified emails that she put out on her server?
[00:13:10.867 --> 00:13:12.987]  As far as I'm concerned, she's cleared.
[00:13:13.467 --> 00:13:15.728]  Hillary Clinton is cleared from all charges.
[00:13:16.708 --> 00:13:17.609]  She is clear.
[00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:18.149]  100% clear.
[00:13:18.169 --> 00:13:20.231]  What do you think of Bill Clinton?
[00:13:20.911 --> 00:13:21.351]  Awesome!
[00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:23.033]  I campaigned with Bill Clinton.
[00:13:23.293 --> 00:13:24.233]  I got him elected.
[00:13:24.594 --> 00:13:25.834]  I got him certified.
[00:13:27.035 --> 00:13:30.197]  I got him elected for President of the United States twice.
[00:13:30.878 --> 00:13:32.499]  He is the best president we've ever had.
[00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:33.480]  So is Obama.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.301]  Obama's totally awesome.
[00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:35.941]  We're gonna miss him.
[00:13:36.942 --> 00:13:37.763]  I'm gonna miss him too.
[00:13:38.523 --> 00:13:41.264]  Alright, what do you think the biggest things are in this country that need to be changed?
[00:13:41.765 --> 00:13:45.286]  What do I need to be, uh, things that need to be changed?
[00:13:46.247 --> 00:13:49.348]  Uh, basically to keep everything remain the same.
[00:13:50.369 --> 00:13:52.289]  Everything has to be remain the same.
[00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:53.870]  You think everything's good right now?
[00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.530]  Yes, sir.
[00:13:54.691 --> 00:13:57.452]  Everything is awesome, outstanding, good.
[00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:58.472]  Alright.
[00:13:58.752 --> 00:14:02.174]  And I agree with Hillary Clinton 100% pure proof.
[00:14:02.594 --> 00:14:05.495]  She will become the next president of the United States.
[00:14:05.556 --> 00:14:06.396]  She's got my back.
[00:14:07.193 --> 00:14:08.034]  Alright, thank you very much.
[00:14:08.054 --> 00:14:08.454]  Have a good one.
[00:14:13.393 --> 00:14:14.273]  He had a Hillary sign.
[00:14:14.393 --> 00:14:14.794]  What's wrong?
[00:14:14.814 --> 00:14:16.014]  I hate Hillary.
[00:14:16.214 --> 00:14:17.555]  Hillary Clinton is not the answer.
[00:14:17.855 --> 00:14:19.295]  But you don't interview guys in their pajamas.
[00:14:19.736 --> 00:14:19.996]  You know?
[00:14:20.236 --> 00:14:22.197]  You're trying to ridicule the crowd.
[00:14:22.457 --> 00:14:22.817]  Okay?
[00:14:22.957 --> 00:14:23.297]  No, no, no.
[00:14:23.317 --> 00:14:24.118]  I'm not trying to ridicule the crowd.
[00:14:24.138 --> 00:14:25.318]  Alex Jones has got an agenda.
[00:14:25.338 --> 00:14:25.958]  Don't tell me he doesn't.
[00:14:26.739 --> 00:14:29.260]  What I'm trying to do is talk to people who are... He said he wanted to talk to me.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.080]  Alright, alright.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:30.500]  Hold on guys.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:36.823]  So this guy comes over here and chides me for interviewing a guy because I'm only supposed to interview people that he approves.
[00:14:36.843 --> 00:14:38.223]  So that's another liberal mindset.
[00:14:38.263 --> 00:14:41.685]  You can't talk to people except the ones that we say you can talk to.
[00:14:42.858 --> 00:14:45.320]  This guy, he's a Democratic leader, he says.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.621]  He works with Greg Vitale.
[00:14:47.382 --> 00:14:51.226]  I mean, he probably has more political cred than the guy I'm talking to now.
[00:14:52.447 --> 00:14:54.489]  There's Greg Vitale, Pennsylvania House of Representatives.
[00:14:54.869 --> 00:14:57.031]  Greg Vitale sent him, he said.
[00:14:57.691 --> 00:15:02.456]  He was that coherent enough to know who this guy is, a Pennsylvania House Rep, who he probably volunteers for.
[00:15:03.857 --> 00:15:05.358]  But listen to this guy.
[00:15:05.398 --> 00:15:08.120]  He's like, oh, you're interviewing a guy in his pajamas, blah, blah, blah.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.181]  You can only interview people that I approve.
[00:15:10.602 --> 00:15:11.542]  And then I interview him.
[00:15:11.702 --> 00:15:13.164]  And he hates Hillary.
[00:15:13.864 --> 00:15:15.285]  Nobody liked Hillary at the DNC.
[00:15:15.305 --> 00:15:15.905]  It was crazy.
[00:15:16.106 --> 00:15:22.370]  Except for the few hundred people that were in that arena that could get through the two-mile security cord.
[00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:23.631]  Let's finish up with this guy.
[00:15:25.233 --> 00:15:26.173]  I'm not a Hillary supporter.
[00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:27.073]  Are you a Bernie supporter?
[00:15:27.234 --> 00:15:28.234]  I am a Bernie supporter.
[00:15:28.314 --> 00:15:28.714]  That's cool.
[00:15:28.774 --> 00:15:30.274]  We're actually here looking for Bernie supporters.
[00:15:30.634 --> 00:15:35.176]  I was asking about the DNC stealing the nomination for Hillary Clinton.
[00:15:35.196 --> 00:15:36.296]  What do you think of that?
[00:15:36.456 --> 00:15:38.056]  I think the DNC is shameful.
[00:15:38.456 --> 00:15:39.877]  Washington Shultz should resign.
[00:15:40.337 --> 00:15:41.857]  The whole DNC should be abolished.
[00:15:41.937 --> 00:15:43.098]  It's a corrupt institution.
[00:15:43.638 --> 00:15:51.220]  It's destroyed the working class and most industrial towns in the whole country because of the policies pursued by the Clinton family.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.701]  I totally agree with you.
[00:15:52.801 --> 00:15:55.463]  It goes back to Bill Clinton, and nobody's talking about that.
[00:15:55.543 --> 00:15:56.124]  You see what I mean?
[00:15:56.464 --> 00:16:01.288]  Bill Clinton was the guy who did... He poured gasoline on deindustrialization, which started in the 70s.
[00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:02.549]  See what I mean?
[00:16:03.109 --> 00:16:04.350]  He went with global trade.
[00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:07.073]  He did all this bank finance, Wall Street stuff.
[00:16:07.553 --> 00:16:08.754]  He deregulated the banks.
[00:16:09.294 --> 00:16:10.135]  He's the problem.
[00:16:10.275 --> 00:16:10.896]  You see what I mean?
[00:16:11.016 --> 00:16:12.377]  And Hillary is gonna be more to sing.
[00:16:12.617 --> 00:16:12.937]  I agree.
[00:16:12.957 --> 00:16:20.664]  What we're trying to educate people on is globalism is the problem, not free market capitalism or the way our country has been.
[00:16:20.684 --> 00:16:22.806]  Globalism is a corporate agenda.
[00:16:22.886 --> 00:16:25.928]  It's NAFTA, it's the Obama TPP thing.
[00:16:25.988 --> 00:16:30.032]  It's a corporate rights agenda over American workers, American communities.
[00:16:31.753 --> 00:16:35.214]  You know, this is one of the few things, this is what explains Trump's appeal.
[00:16:35.655 --> 00:16:39.616]  Because he's appealing to people who have been disenfranchised and betrayed by the Democrats.
[00:16:39.996 --> 00:16:43.357]  And now they don't have jobs, they don't have hope, they don't have communities that are viable.
[00:16:43.677 --> 00:16:43.858]  Sure.
[00:16:44.278 --> 00:16:45.178]  That's what's going on.
[00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:46.539]  Totally agree with you.
[00:16:46.559 --> 00:16:50.180]  And I'd like to see the Bernie-Trump debate, personally, because I think our country needs to have it.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.640]  I completely agree with that.
[00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:53.461]  Alright, so see, we are in agreement.
[00:16:53.661 --> 00:16:54.081]  There you go.
[00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:54.822]  Alright, fist bump.
[00:16:55.022 --> 00:16:55.362]  There you go.
[00:16:55.422 --> 00:16:56.502]  Alright, have a good one.
[00:16:56.522 --> 00:16:58.383]  This is Rob Duke, reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:17:00.362 --> 00:17:03.785]  And that was one of the first interviews I got rolling into the DNC.
[00:17:05.426 --> 00:17:10.491]  And, you know, that's really what we're up against when you look at it.
[00:17:11.472 --> 00:17:14.434]  You know, that guy understood why he was being attacked.
[00:17:15.655 --> 00:17:19.178]  The policies of Bill Clinton had destroyed the lives of the people he knew.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.881]  And he could see that.
[00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:25.183]  The other guy, Anthony, couldn't.
[00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:26.525]  He couldn't see
[00:17:27.884 --> 00:17:34.349]  That the policies of Bill Clinton and Obama have not created a country where we should be having prosperity for all.
[00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.671]  There's no reason why we can't.
[00:17:38.112 --> 00:17:39.753]  I got a guest coming up in about half an hour.
[00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:44.697]  And first thing I'm going to ask him to do is bless the day.
[00:17:44.717 --> 00:17:47.098]  Because this is going to be a big day.
[00:17:47.158 --> 00:17:52.282]  This is a day that's going to probably lay out the next 25 to 30 years of
[00:17:57.153 --> 00:17:58.773]  Of our course, where we're going to go.
[00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:01.834]  And.
[00:18:03.134 --> 00:18:08.055]  I think we do need a little spiritual uplifting this morning and also want to do something else.
[00:18:08.095 --> 00:18:11.236]  I'm going to start it today since I'm the first one on this morning.
[00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:14.197]  Let's start a little informal InfoWars U.S.
[00:18:14.277 --> 00:18:15.417]  United States election poll.
[00:18:16.857 --> 00:18:20.998]  So we have, let's see, we have Pat, John, Bruce and Dave.
[00:18:21.018 --> 00:18:22.478]  We've got four of you guys on.
[00:18:22.498 --> 00:18:24.499]  I basically
[00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:32.080]  I want you to say your name, where you're from, who you voted for, and why.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.620]  And I'm pretty sure you're all going to say Trump, but maybe not.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.041]  But I do want Hillary supporters to call in.
[00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.042]  And that number to call in.
[00:18:42.062 --> 00:18:44.882]  Actually, I'll take these four calls and then I'll give out the number again.
[00:18:44.922 --> 00:18:46.643]  But I want to see Hillary supporters call in.
[00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:50.684]  I'm going to try to take as many calls, but I can't sit and have conversations with you.
[00:18:53.151 --> 00:18:58.596]  You may get one extra sentence in, but I really want you to say your name, where you're from, who you voted for, and why.
[00:19:00.518 --> 00:19:02.480]  And I don't think that's too much to ask this morning.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.564]  So we can get as many hashtags over in this column than in this column.
[00:19:07.044 --> 00:19:08.285]  And it's just a little informal poll.
[00:19:08.986 --> 00:19:10.407]  So my guess is coming up in half an hour.
[00:19:10.647 --> 00:19:12.609]  I'm going to be here until 9.
[00:19:14.271 --> 00:19:15.932]  Owen's supposed to come back in at...
[00:19:17.261 --> 00:19:17.942]  I don't know.
[00:19:49.989 --> 00:19:51.230]  I can't hear him if he's there, guys.
[00:19:52.951 --> 00:19:54.753]  Oh, alright, he probably put the phone down.
[00:19:54.813 --> 00:19:56.434]  Keep him on hold, if y'all can.
[00:19:56.935 --> 00:19:58.075]  Let's go to John and Callie.
[00:19:58.095 --> 00:20:00.057]  I guess we got a lot of Callie people who haven't gone to bed yet.
[00:20:01.478 --> 00:20:01.938]  Can you hear me?
[00:20:02.199 --> 00:20:02.959]  Yeah, go ahead, John.
[00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:07.383]  I will be voting for Donald Trump.
[00:20:07.843 --> 00:20:18.992]  Main reason why, I was raised, like, conservative and everything, but I started doing a lot of research over the past couple years, because I just started to see more and more.
[00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:21.448]  How dare you bring those up?
[00:20:21.568 --> 00:20:22.909]  You don't like spirit cooking?
[00:20:46.539 --> 00:20:47.059]  Amazing.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.521]  John, what time do the polls open in your area?
[00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:49.941]  7 a.m.?
[00:20:49.981 --> 00:20:52.122]  Yeah, I think 7.
[00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:54.764]  Yeah, I think that's what time they open here.
[00:20:54.804 --> 00:20:57.786]  In fact, they just opened on the East Coast about half an hour ago.
[00:20:57.806 --> 00:20:58.766]  They're going to open here at 7.
[00:20:59.547 --> 00:21:01.208]  As soon as I get off, I'm actually going to vote.
[00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:05.970]  Yeah, I'm going as soon as my roommates can wake up and take me.
[00:21:07.231 --> 00:21:08.812]  I'm originally from Colorado.
[00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:13.475]  I wish I could have voted there because, I mean, California almost feels like a waste with all the
[00:21:14.577 --> 00:21:15.598]  You never know, man.
[00:21:15.718 --> 00:21:16.478]  You never know.
[00:21:16.558 --> 00:21:17.739]  Yeah, that's why I'm going.
[00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:18.600]  That's why I'm going.
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:19.280]  You never know.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.543]  People who think that, you know, he may lose California by a thousand votes.
[00:21:23.883 --> 00:21:24.624]  You never know.
[00:21:24.684 --> 00:21:29.447]  Although, they completely stole it for Hillary in the primary.
[00:21:29.767 --> 00:21:31.088]  And there's all kinds of evidence of that.
[00:21:32.589 --> 00:21:34.150]  Oh, yeah.
[00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.550]  Totally.
[00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:35.711]  Oh, thanks for calling, John.
[00:21:35.731 --> 00:21:38.793]  Let's go to Bruce in Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:21:40.302 --> 00:21:43.064]  Bruce, who are you voting for?
[00:21:43.324 --> 00:21:43.665]  Trump.
[00:21:44.245 --> 00:21:44.525]  Trump.
[00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:45.686]  I'm voting for Trump.
[00:21:45.746 --> 00:21:50.370]  Yep, I'm sitting in front of my polling place open to 6 o'clock.
[00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.551]  I've just been waiting to talk to you.
[00:21:53.192 --> 00:21:57.435]  Because the reason I'm voting for Trump is because I'm the son of a Holocaust survivor.
[00:21:58.035 --> 00:22:02.899]  And I know firsthand, through my father's eyes, what hate is all about.
[00:22:03.519 --> 00:22:07.062]  And if this country doesn't wake up, listen to Alex Jones.
[00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:09.906]  Hear what that patriot has to say.
[00:22:09.926 --> 00:22:11.487]  Hear what you have to say.
[00:22:11.527 --> 00:22:12.867]  Hear what Owen has to say.
[00:22:12.887 --> 00:22:15.829]  We're in for deep doo-doo.
[00:22:16.729 --> 00:22:18.210]  The Nazis were bad.
[00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:19.911]  Hillary's even worse.
[00:22:20.451 --> 00:22:25.293]  And if you don't think that she is, you've got another thought coming.
[00:22:25.353 --> 00:22:29.095]  Because my father was in 10 concentration camps.
[00:22:29.795 --> 00:22:33.717]  Lost his whole family when he was 19 years old.
[00:22:33.737 --> 00:22:35.838]  Fired off to Treblinka.
[00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:42.511]  And he went through Joseph Mengele at Auschwitz and was condemned to the gas chambers.
[00:22:42.851 --> 00:22:55.974]  And the only reason he survived was because the Russian prisoners of war, I mean, the SS trooper turned his back for one minute and allowed my father to duck under the rope and hide out with the Russian prisoners of war.
[00:22:56.594 --> 00:23:00.855]  We've done one bowl of soup, an occasional piece of horse meat,
[00:23:01.787 --> 00:23:02.348]  We're good to go.
[00:23:20.103 --> 00:23:23.206]  You've got another thought coming, so I want America to wake up.
[00:23:23.586 --> 00:23:27.870]  Don't just vote because it's Democrat, or because she's a woman.
[00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:36.797]  The thing that bothers me, Rob, is that so many of the church people write their pastors, and they say, I don't want to offend this person.
[00:23:37.778 --> 00:23:41.481]  Well, it's not about offending someone, it's about getting an education.
[00:23:41.842 --> 00:23:45.405]  It's about looking at the facts, if they only knew.
[00:23:46.198 --> 00:23:48.419]  How criminal this woman is!
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.420]  What she has done!
[00:23:50.861 --> 00:23:53.542]  I mean, it's all... It's terrible!
[00:23:54.022 --> 00:24:01.427]  And... I know I'm taking up some of your time, but I appreciate so much what this program does and what you people do.
[00:24:01.987 --> 00:24:03.668]  And people, you better wake up.
[00:24:04.849 --> 00:24:09.371]  I can only say that I work as a docent for the Holocaust Museum.
[00:24:09.731 --> 00:24:14.254]  Whenever they come through Kansas City, I talk to teenage kids.
[00:24:14.924 --> 00:24:16.945]  I try to educate them about hate.
[00:24:17.985 --> 00:24:27.369]  And if you don't think that Trump is the answer for civility, for peace in America, you've got another thought coming.
[00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:36.692]  Well, Bruce, as you were talking, I was showing what Lady Gaga was wearing last night on her little Hillary Clinton rally.
[00:24:37.333 --> 00:24:40.534]  And she looks like an authoritarian commissar.
[00:24:42.608 --> 00:24:47.430]  You know, she doesn't have the swastika on her arm, but she's got the red band on her arm.
[00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:52.732]  And she's allowed to do that.
[00:24:53.592 --> 00:24:57.473]  If Trump had Lady Gaga on stage wearing that, it would be the end of the world.
[00:24:58.574 --> 00:25:08.457]  If Trump got on stage with Jay-Z and the other rappers the other night who were cursing and talking about drugs and horribly misogynist lyrics.
[00:25:11.254 --> 00:25:13.816]  We had the 13-minute report that Millie Weaver did.
[00:25:16.097 --> 00:25:26.783]  If Trump had gone on stage with those people and said, I love it, they're great, I love their support, Beyonce's a great role model, as she's bashing in car windows and telling people to go fight with the police.
[00:25:29.645 --> 00:25:30.566]  It's a real disconnect.
[00:25:31.246 --> 00:25:32.147]  It's a real disconnect.
[00:25:32.427 --> 00:25:38.771]  And now the government, at the end of the night,
[00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:44.873]  He came out on drudge that the government's worried about hacks from Russia.
[00:25:44.893 --> 00:25:49.856]  They're still going to play this Russia card because they know it's a landslide for Trump.
[00:25:50.657 --> 00:25:54.459]  And they say the only way they can seal it... I'll go ahead and make the prediction now.
[00:25:54.499 --> 00:25:59.022]  I think around 5 o'clock you're going to see something happen and they're going to shut down results.
[00:25:59.102 --> 00:26:00.463]  Results won't be coming in for a while.
[00:26:03.004 --> 00:26:03.885]  Maybe at 7 o'clock.
[00:26:03.985 --> 00:26:05.066]  I guess polling places close at 7.
[00:26:06.991 --> 00:26:07.551]  Maybe right at 7.
[00:26:07.872 --> 00:26:09.993]  They're going to start having problems.
[00:26:10.754 --> 00:26:15.698]  They've been noticing glitches, but we got our men in underground bunkers trying to fix it right now.
[00:26:16.178 --> 00:26:17.960]  Fraction magic is going into action.
[00:26:19.261 --> 00:26:21.062]  And the votes will start flipping.
[00:26:22.423 --> 00:26:23.224]  Thanks for calling, Bruce.
[00:26:24.725 --> 00:26:26.647]  I wish more people could hear your words.
[00:26:26.687 --> 00:26:28.568]  I hope people are spreading the link out there.
[00:26:28.588 --> 00:26:30.170]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.331]  Spreading the Facebook link.
[00:26:33.052 --> 00:26:35.574]  Sending the feed out on your Facebook link.
[00:26:37.227 --> 00:26:38.088]  Call your followers.
[00:26:38.948 --> 00:26:40.209]  Call the people that subscribe to you.
[00:26:40.229 --> 00:26:43.011]  Because that's the only way it's going to happen.
[00:26:44.652 --> 00:26:46.474]  Guys, can y'all bring in these specials?
[00:26:47.374 --> 00:26:48.595]  We have a lot of specials right now.
[00:26:48.935 --> 00:27:02.165]  30 to 40% off Supermail Vitality, DNA Force, X2, I think it's 20% off Secret 12, and 15% off Mullen Labe products.
[00:27:02.185 --> 00:27:05.067]  The t-shirts, I'm actually wearing one of the Mullen Labe shirts under this.
[00:27:08.068 --> 00:27:11.109]  25% off Biome Defense.
[00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:15.871]  30 to 40% off the Storable Foods.
[00:27:16.132 --> 00:27:17.092]  30% off Silver Bullet.
[00:27:18.573 --> 00:27:21.434]  Thanks.
[00:27:21.454 --> 00:27:23.515]  And we don't even make a lot of money off these.
[00:27:23.595 --> 00:27:24.795]  We're discounting them so much.
[00:27:26.356 --> 00:27:30.497]  And that 30% off, that's a big cut into our profit, which helps us grow.
[00:27:30.998 --> 00:27:33.098]  And you've seen the way Alex has made this place grow.
[00:27:34.459 --> 00:27:35.559]  I came in here in 2009 in February.
[00:27:38.497 --> 00:27:42.318]  And a quarter of this building is what we're using.
[00:27:42.358 --> 00:27:43.699]  This was the main studio.
[00:27:44.639 --> 00:27:46.320]  Now we have two giant studios.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:47.940]  State-of-the-art.
[00:27:52.842 --> 00:27:55.623]  When I say state-of-the-art, I say state-of-the-art that's not mainstream media.
[00:27:55.663 --> 00:27:56.963]  State-of-the-art alternative media.
[00:27:58.004 --> 00:28:05.946]  You know, we're not funded by giant multinational drug companies that push Prozac and other things on you.
[00:28:07.067 --> 00:28:07.487]  We try to
[00:28:08.658 --> 00:28:14.521]  Give you honest health information and provide products that help you get your body where it needs to be.
[00:28:15.701 --> 00:28:20.003]  Because we are not going to win this thing if we're sick and dying and tired.
[00:28:22.344 --> 00:28:24.005]  So go check out InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:24.065 --> 00:28:25.626]  Go check out InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:28:27.066 --> 00:28:27.887]  Get Silver Bullet.
[00:28:28.727 --> 00:28:29.367]  Get X2.
[00:28:29.427 --> 00:28:30.268]  Get DNA Force.
[00:28:30.608 --> 00:28:31.108]  Try them out.
[00:28:36.087 --> 00:28:36.968]  Got a silver bullet.
[00:28:37.688 --> 00:28:42.132]  I had a little, I had rubbed my eye over the weekend and my finger, my hand was kind of dirty.
[00:28:42.172 --> 00:28:44.114]  I'm like, oh man, I bet something's going to happen.
[00:28:44.354 --> 00:28:46.155]  Two days later, I woke up, my eye started hurting.
[00:28:47.296 --> 00:28:51.199]  I put... Man, I'm not going to recommend anybody do this.
[00:28:51.239 --> 00:28:51.980]  This is what I did.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:52.961]  I'm not a doctor.
[00:28:53.281 --> 00:28:55.143]  I provide no medical advice.
[00:28:58.544 --> 00:29:00.986]  Two days of putting drops in, twice a day, in my eye.
[00:29:01.246 --> 00:29:01.526]  Gone.
[00:29:01.966 --> 00:29:04.288]  Didn't have to go to the doctor, didn't have to wait for it to get worse.
[00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:06.790]  My body was telling me something was wrong.
[00:29:07.671 --> 00:29:09.872]  I went and grabbed the tools and fixed it.
[00:29:12.734 --> 00:29:13.755]  And that's what a lot of it is.
[00:29:14.375 --> 00:29:15.476]  The tools are within us.
[00:29:16.317 --> 00:29:17.458]  The tools to fix everything.
[00:29:18.879 --> 00:29:20.680]  We just have to look to ourselves and be confident.
[00:29:23.522 --> 00:29:24.743]  And if they do steal it for Hillary,
[00:29:28.479 --> 00:29:29.979]  We're going to keep showcasing everything.
[00:29:30.019 --> 00:29:34.080]  There's so many WikiLeaks to go back through and retool and go after again.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.381]  We'll keep doing it.
[00:29:37.141 --> 00:29:37.921]  We're not going to stop.
[00:29:40.721 --> 00:29:49.423]  You know, one of the things that has always attracted me to Alex Jones, I started listening to him in 98, it was, he attacked Clinton where Clinton was wrong.
[00:29:49.623 --> 00:29:51.204]  He attacked Bush where Bush was wrong.
[00:29:51.724 --> 00:29:53.344]  He attacked Obama where Obama's wrong.
[00:29:56.264 --> 00:30:01.926]  And if Trump gets in and he doesn't do the things he says he's going to do, we're going to hold his feet to the fire too.
[00:30:03.286 --> 00:30:04.346]  Make no mistake about it.
[00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:10.708]  But let me tell you, what Trump is saying, no one has ever said on this campaign trail, at least since I've been alive.
[00:30:11.928 --> 00:30:13.349]  No one said the kind of things he said.
[00:30:15.129 --> 00:30:17.350]  And that takes guts.
[00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.651]  He's put his own fortune in, his own personal fortune.
[00:30:21.738 --> 00:30:23.759]  He's had every dirty trick at the book thrown at him.
[00:30:24.019 --> 00:30:32.683]  There was a story this morning, I actually gave it to Alex, about the girl who said he raped her when he was 13 on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane or island, whatever.
[00:30:32.963 --> 00:30:33.844]  Oh, she made it all up.
[00:30:34.884 --> 00:30:35.665]  Made it all up.
[00:30:38.126 --> 00:30:40.047]  That's the kind of dirty tricks they've been throwing at him.
[00:30:40.487 --> 00:30:41.827]  And the media has piled on him.
[00:30:43.168 --> 00:30:44.809]  Like, unlike anyone you've ever seen.
[00:30:46.752 --> 00:30:47.653]  There it is, exclusive.
[00:30:47.693 --> 00:30:54.418]  Trump's 13-year-old rape victim dramatically drops her case, withdraws legal claims she was assaulted at Jeffrey Epstein's sex party.
[00:30:55.779 --> 00:30:56.159]  Wow.
[00:30:58.521 --> 00:31:01.364]  Clinton supporters had seized on the story as a possible knockout blow.
[00:31:01.704 --> 00:31:09.170]  Yeah, when we were at the rally in Austin, a lot of people coming up, oh, he rapes 13-year-old girls, it's gonna come out.
[00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.071]  He rapes 13-year-old girls, it's gonna come out.
[00:31:12.172 --> 00:31:13.033]  Well, she dropped her case.
[00:31:14.656 --> 00:31:19.921]  Wow, she cancelled a press conference where she was going to reveal herself for the first time and then she cancelled it.
[00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:23.844]  What a surprise.
[00:31:25.585 --> 00:31:26.326]  What a surprise.
[00:31:28.688 --> 00:31:29.529]  And Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:32.051]  Oh, that's the guy, Clinton.
[00:31:32.371 --> 00:31:34.613]  Clinton went to his, was on his plane 26 times.
[00:31:35.394 --> 00:31:36.715]  Several times without Secret Service.
[00:31:37.376 --> 00:31:38.817]  Hillary Clinton was on there six times.
[00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:42.460]  Convicted pedophile.
[00:31:45.819 --> 00:31:46.899]  Look at the pictures of his island.
[00:31:46.939 --> 00:31:48.260]  He's got a little Moloch temple.
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:51.320]  No.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.021]  Flew on sex offenders jet more previously than known.
[00:31:56.281 --> 00:31:56.721]  Wow.
[00:32:00.582 --> 00:32:02.462]  And you want to put these people back in the White House?
[00:32:02.882 --> 00:32:03.863]  That's the scary thing.
[00:32:04.483 --> 00:32:06.903]  Uh, did Pat, is he, is he back on from LA?
[00:32:08.644 --> 00:32:09.264]  Pat, are you there?
[00:32:12.624 --> 00:32:13.945]  No, he might have fallen asleep.
[00:32:17.766 --> 00:32:19.288]  Uh, it's close to five in the morning there.
[00:32:19.308 --> 00:32:20.729]  Let's go to Dave in Montana.
[00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:22.311]  Long time listener.
[00:32:22.331 --> 00:32:26.074]  I guess he heard the Molyneux interview.
[00:32:26.154 --> 00:32:27.976]  Which one, Alex's or the one I did with him?
[00:32:28.997 --> 00:32:29.537]  Both of them.
[00:32:29.778 --> 00:32:30.198]  Both of them.
[00:32:30.358 --> 00:32:31.179]  So you've been up for a while.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.401]  Yeah, brother.
[00:32:34.022 --> 00:32:39.587]  I'm, you know, I'm an info warrior from back in the day, man!
[00:32:39.667 --> 00:32:40.087]  Yeah!
[00:32:41.447 --> 00:32:47.949]  Hey, Rob, it's really a pleasure to talk to you live, right?
[00:32:48.089 --> 00:32:54.412]  I've been sitting here, and again, when you call in and you're on hold forever, right?
[00:32:55.192 --> 00:32:59.994]  And I'm fortunate enough that I've got a microphone and headphones.
[00:33:00.054 --> 00:33:03.875]  You know, maybe someday I might be cool, right?
[00:33:04.215 --> 00:33:05.295]  But I'm not cool yet.
[00:33:06.056 --> 00:33:09.777]  But the bottom line is, man,
[00:33:11.085 --> 00:33:21.631]  Uh, Tip of the Spear, all those, yeah, Stefan Molyneux, yeah, his interview with Milo rocked it.
[00:33:22.892 --> 00:33:24.392]  I haven't seen that yet, I'll check that out.
[00:33:24.953 --> 00:33:26.674]  No, do, do check it out.
[00:33:26.834 --> 00:33:36.299]  I mean, it's, um, it's like, uh, Gerald Solente, you know, he's just, uh, uh, he's just,
[00:33:38.854 --> 00:33:42.998]  Well, I can't even... I can't even... I'm sorry.
[00:33:43.018 --> 00:33:44.559]  Hey Dave, who are you voting for?
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.901]  Trump!
[00:33:46.081 --> 00:33:47.763]  Yeah.
[00:33:48.343 --> 00:33:50.466]  Oh, by the way, register voted.
[00:33:50.626 --> 00:33:54.470]  I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere, Montana, right?
[00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:57.133]  But it's the beautiful... It's a good place to be.
[00:33:57.193 --> 00:33:57.813]  It is.
[00:33:58.174 --> 00:33:58.414]  It is.
[00:34:00.592 --> 00:34:00.892]  You know?
[00:34:01.452 --> 00:34:05.713]  I have a buddy that lives in Missoula and mountains all around it.
[00:34:05.753 --> 00:34:06.354]  Beautiful town.
[00:34:06.374 --> 00:34:07.394]  It is.
[00:34:07.694 --> 00:34:13.576]  And I live west of Missoula in the mountains of... Anyway.
[00:34:14.496 --> 00:34:15.156]  Nah, Rob.
[00:34:15.416 --> 00:34:16.997]  You're welcome here anytime, bro.
[00:34:17.597 --> 00:34:19.237]  I live on the Clark Fork River.
[00:34:19.677 --> 00:34:27.320]  I look out my front door and so many people... And again, I was a corporate dick way back in the day, right?
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:38.765]  But yeah, I look out my front door, and I look at my dog, and I'm in heaven.
[00:34:39.865 --> 00:34:43.047]  There's so many people that go, you don't like it there?
[00:34:43.067 --> 00:34:46.789]  I want to shoot you in the head, you know?
[00:34:48.129 --> 00:34:49.010]  No, it's beautiful.
[00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.090]  Rob, it's beautiful.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:52.901]  Hey, come on.
[00:34:52.941 --> 00:34:54.583]  We're talking about the election.
[00:34:54.643 --> 00:34:55.765]  Jesus Christ.
[00:34:55.945 --> 00:34:58.708]  You're just shooting me in the fucking foot here, Rob.
[00:34:58.908 --> 00:34:59.849]  I brought up Montana.
[00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.412]  Oh, just remember, we maybe have some young kids out there.
[00:35:03.093 --> 00:35:04.555]  We don't want to teach them those words.
[00:35:04.675 --> 00:35:05.636]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:35:05.716 --> 00:35:06.597]  I apologize.
[00:35:06.738 --> 00:35:07.478]  I apologize.
[00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:08.980]  Hey, did you see on the Drudge Report?
[00:35:09.847 --> 00:35:11.188]  Guys, we can bring up this video.
[00:35:11.848 --> 00:35:13.929]  It's on the top and it's a Twitter video.
[00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:17.691]  And it looks like Hillary kind of, she's being held up now by Bill.
[00:35:18.292 --> 00:35:24.055]  Got his arm around her and then she gets in somebody else's arms and they're holding her and they're trying to push her into the car.
[00:35:24.615 --> 00:35:26.616]  They're like, come on Hillary, get in the car.
[00:35:27.156 --> 00:35:29.418]  We gotta take you to the Bruce Springsteen concert.
[00:35:33.367 --> 00:35:33.808]  Come on.
[00:35:33.968 --> 00:35:34.348]  Come on.
[00:35:34.388 --> 00:35:35.789]  She can't even walk down.
[00:35:35.949 --> 00:35:37.830]  She can't even walk down a little tarmac.
[00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:39.111]  Ah, shit, Rob.
[00:35:39.631 --> 00:35:39.991]  Man.
[00:35:42.093 --> 00:35:46.695]  You know, you look at a man like Donald Trump, and I'm sorry.
[00:35:46.855 --> 00:35:48.837]  OK, the grab the pussy.
[00:35:50.498 --> 00:35:50.958]  Jesus.
[00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:55.981]  And I'm sorry for all those little children that are still up tonight.
[00:35:57.642 --> 00:35:58.182]  I'm sorry.
[00:35:58.563 --> 00:36:00.584]  I've been a man's man.
[00:36:00.704 --> 00:36:02.345]  And, you know,
[00:36:04.201 --> 00:36:04.781]  I'm sorry.
[00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:10.123]  It didn't even faze me that it doesn't matter.
[00:36:10.523 --> 00:36:16.225]  Issues of no significance and that's what the left loves to capitalize on and try to make you think those are the biggest issues in the world.
[00:36:17.625 --> 00:36:19.386]  Just like Russian hack attacks.
[00:36:19.406 --> 00:36:20.166]  Here's the article here.
[00:36:20.446 --> 00:36:23.047]  All hands on deck to protect elections from hack say officials.
[00:36:24.007 --> 00:36:24.907]  This is on NBC.
[00:36:24.927 --> 00:36:26.488]  This is the top of drudge right now.
[00:36:27.386 --> 00:36:32.848]  They're so afraid of the Russians, they've even sent back-channel communications to them, telling them not to do anything.
[00:36:33.248 --> 00:36:34.129]  Let's find that out.
[00:36:34.209 --> 00:36:36.129]  We were reading this article online.
[00:36:36.649 --> 00:36:36.729]  U.S.
[00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:45.113]  officials have accused Russia of using cyber operations to meddle in the election, hacking into the Democratic Party accounts and leaking material to embarrass Hillary Clinton, not showcasing her crimes.
[00:36:45.773 --> 00:36:46.353]  No, no.
[00:36:47.273 --> 00:36:48.634]  We're embarrassing Hillary Clinton.
[00:36:51.561 --> 00:37:02.947]  On Tuesday, former NATO Commander Admiral James Stavridis told CNBC his concerns about possible Russian activity, including a dump of false documents and an attack on the power grid.
[00:37:05.028 --> 00:37:13.272]  On Friday, the hacker knows Gertzberg 2.0, which officials say is a front for Russian intelligence, tweeted a threat to monitor the U.S.
[00:37:13.312 --> 00:37:14.853]  election from inside the system.
[00:37:15.354 --> 00:37:15.474]  U.S.
[00:37:15.514 --> 00:37:19.856]  officials have delivered a back-channel warning to Russia not to do anything that would affect the vote.
[00:37:21.067 --> 00:37:31.457]  But there are widespread fears that cyber mischief by hackers from either Russia or elsewhere, like maybe the United States, will somehow mar the election.
[00:37:32.698 --> 00:37:32.939]  Yeah.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:39.265]  When the landslide starts happening, there's gonna be chaos at the poll.
[00:37:40.706 --> 00:37:42.328]  There's gonna be hacked computers.
[00:37:43.489 --> 00:37:45.531]  We're gonna have to suspend the election.
[00:37:48.277 --> 00:37:53.621]  And then, magically, they'll gain everything back, and they'll turn everything back on, and plug everything back in.
[00:37:53.721 --> 00:37:55.322]  Hillary Clinton will magically be in the lead.
[00:37:55.362 --> 00:37:56.663]  Just barely, though, just barely.
[00:37:56.703 --> 00:37:57.523]  She just barely beat him.
[00:37:57.963 --> 00:38:04.047]  But all the exit polls, which will magically be erased, will show Trump had a massive lead going into today.
[00:38:04.508 --> 00:38:07.290]  People are sick and tired of the establishment.
[00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:09.051]  We want a reset.
[00:38:09.831 --> 00:38:16.656]  And Trump's not perfect, but he gives us breathing room to talk about what we need in this country.
[00:38:17.594 --> 00:38:22.356]  Not running for the hills every time they want to, you know, take everything from us.
[00:38:22.396 --> 00:38:23.496]  Everything that we earn.
[00:38:26.377 --> 00:38:27.598]  Dave, thanks for calling.
[00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:28.558]  Enjoy Montana.
[00:38:28.638 --> 00:38:29.718]  It is a great state.
[00:38:30.739 --> 00:38:32.539]  Let's go to Andrew in New Mexico.
[00:38:32.779 --> 00:38:34.540]  Andrew, who are you voting for?
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.141]  Trump.
[00:38:36.321 --> 00:38:37.401]  How much time do I have?
[00:38:38.942 --> 00:38:39.782]  You got time, go ahead.
[00:38:40.162 --> 00:38:41.983]  Well, you got a little time.
[00:38:42.824 --> 00:38:44.504]  Alright, I'll just jump to the most important bit then.
[00:38:44.865 --> 00:38:45.405]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:38:45.445 --> 00:38:46.265]  You want to talk about Kim Jones?
[00:38:46.345 --> 00:38:47.305]  I'm really focused.
[00:38:48.246 --> 00:38:51.867]  Nah, I'm gonna jump right to alternate route for the left.
[00:38:52.127 --> 00:38:54.827]  Well, not the left, but the power of the B. Yep.
[00:38:54.847 --> 00:39:02.269]  So, I know it's tempting to look at Hillary as this top dog, all this power, but she's just one of the players.
[00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:06.270]  And as such, she's getting too risky to back anymore.
[00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:11.232]  So, some things they could do, they could do a reverse rig, where they
[00:39:12.071 --> 00:39:21.416]  Have Trump win as the votes would have been, but they'll have him get in through forced polls through either Russia or whoever.
[00:39:22.137 --> 00:39:27.460]  And that'll be one way to either have a recount of some sort or just have Obama keep going for a while longer.
[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:37.986]  And I don't know when last time we saw Hillary, but something to keep an eye on is either her illness pops up and we'll have Tim Kaine take over.
[00:39:39.364 --> 00:39:46.170]  Or she mysteriously gets assassinated so Obama has to go for a while longer while they investigate the causes of that.
[00:39:47.511 --> 00:39:54.216]  But it really boils down to how bold the powers that be are feeling.
[00:39:54.236 --> 00:39:57.358]  Because they're not known, they don't fight in Syria.
[00:39:57.378 --> 00:39:59.820]  They get Syrians to fight in Syria.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.582]  They get other people to do their dirty work.
[00:40:02.583 --> 00:40:04.144]  They don't like being bold yet.
[00:40:04.224 --> 00:40:06.626]  They don't have that, they don't have the ability.
[00:40:07.296 --> 00:40:10.059]  To take over a country where everyone is armed?
[00:40:10.359 --> 00:40:10.740]  Not yet.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.160]  No.
[00:40:11.421 --> 00:40:11.781]  Hopefully.
[00:40:12.582 --> 00:40:13.383]  No, I don't think they do.
[00:40:13.883 --> 00:40:27.098]  They're going to face fierce resistance and when the occupying or the invading force realizes they're going to lose, you know, 10 to 20 percent of their people going house to house, maybe even more.
[00:40:28.134 --> 00:40:30.215]  They're gonna, you know, they're gonna think twice.
[00:40:30.235 --> 00:40:34.957]  And you saw how, you know, even in, well, they're fighting Mosul right now.
[00:40:35.037 --> 00:40:36.858]  I think they finally just cleared out Mosul.
[00:40:37.098 --> 00:40:38.239]  That was no cakewalk.
[00:40:38.879 --> 00:40:41.861]  And these weren't, these weren't guys that had superior technology.
[00:40:41.901 --> 00:40:44.342]  They were given arms and they had training.
[00:40:47.283 --> 00:40:50.385]  But you can't stop a man when he keeps on coming.
[00:40:50.405 --> 00:40:52.065]  But these were enemies also that we funded.
[00:40:52.626 --> 00:40:52.906]  ISIS.
[00:40:54.935 --> 00:40:55.395]  Al Qaeda?
[00:40:56.636 --> 00:40:57.437]  It keeps going back.
[00:40:57.617 --> 00:40:59.038]  We just keep funding our enemies.
[00:40:59.718 --> 00:41:00.839]  And then we have to go fight them.
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:08.064]  And we're told by the mainstream media that if we don't go out there and fight these people, they're going to take over.
[00:41:09.505 --> 00:41:11.446]  How are they even getting power in the first place?
[00:41:11.566 --> 00:41:12.907]  Oh, Saudi Arabia, United States.
[00:41:13.688 --> 00:41:15.489]  Oh, how come their missiles have U.S.
[00:41:15.529 --> 00:41:16.109]  writing on them?
[00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.031]  They put out a video where they shot down a helicopter.
[00:41:19.251 --> 00:41:19.892]  Syrian rebels.
[00:41:20.972 --> 00:41:24.475]  And the missile they used, you could see the writing on it that it was English.
[00:41:25.558 --> 00:41:27.119]  Pretty sophisticated missile, too.
[00:41:27.139 --> 00:41:37.768]  I mean, he's setting it all up, drilling everything in, shooting it, hits the helicopter, helicopter goes down, they start Al-Akhbaran, and it's got U.S.
[00:41:37.808 --> 00:41:38.329]  writing on it.
[00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:43.473]  And you look at Benghazi, and how that was just a weapons transfer.
[00:41:44.334 --> 00:41:44.894]  One of the many.
[00:41:45.495 --> 00:41:53.781]  You look at the airdrops where they accidentally dropped arms to them, and you gotta wonder, even General Flynn, he said it was a legitimate decision.
[00:41:54.639 --> 00:41:55.540]  A deliberate decision.
[00:41:56.961 --> 00:41:58.482]  He said that on Al Jazeera.
[00:42:01.264 --> 00:42:02.484]  Andrew, anything else real quick?
[00:42:04.025 --> 00:42:05.867]  Yeah, if I have time for a bit of chemtrail.
[00:42:05.887 --> 00:42:09.669]  I was just going to say, look back at the average male in the 50s.
[00:42:09.889 --> 00:42:17.815]  They're smoking cigarettes non-stop and taking rat poison for performance enhancing drugs, and it's set a world record in sprints and such.
[00:42:18.535 --> 00:42:20.697]  It goes to show what's in our food these days.
[00:42:21.758 --> 00:42:21.938]  Yeah.
[00:42:23.377 --> 00:42:24.618]  I think we're being hit all around.
[00:42:24.638 --> 00:42:36.685]  And, you know, whatever they're spraying us with, I think for the most part they're trying to change the environment, geoengineer.
[00:42:36.985 --> 00:42:38.726]  At least that's the guise that they're using it.
[00:42:39.006 --> 00:42:40.827]  They're saying, look, we're trying to help the earth here.
[00:42:41.728 --> 00:42:44.249]  We have to spray barium and aluminum in the atmosphere.
[00:42:46.851 --> 00:42:48.392]  So, thanks for calling, Andrew.
[00:42:48.652 --> 00:42:51.013]  We'll give Pat one more chance, see if he's awake.
[00:42:51.053 --> 00:42:51.714]  Pat, did you wake up?
[00:42:52.844 --> 00:42:53.505]  You awake this morning?
[00:42:54.986 --> 00:42:55.186]  No.
[00:42:56.227 --> 00:43:00.891]  All right, well, right now we got four votes for Trump, zero votes for Clinton.
[00:43:02.252 --> 00:43:03.113]  I'm not surprised.
[00:43:04.634 --> 00:43:09.158]  The link that you can send out to people, InfoWars.com forward slash show, is our free link.
[00:43:09.778 --> 00:43:11.600]  Imagine how much it costs to send out this.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.301]  We don't even know how many people are watching.
[00:43:13.341 --> 00:43:15.763]  I mean, we do, but at any given moment.
[00:43:16.864 --> 00:43:19.306]  That bandwidth bill goes up and up and up in one way.
[00:43:19.326 --> 00:43:21.028]  You can support us.
[00:43:22.887 --> 00:43:24.648]  Is by going to InfowarsStore.com.
[00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:28.529]  I'm going to read off the specials, and these all include free shipping.

[00:43:44.335 --> 00:43:47.056]  I've got the Pro Pure King at my house with four filters in it.
[00:43:48.096 --> 00:43:50.397]  And we drink water, sands, fluoride.

[00:43:54.968 --> 00:43:59.092]  You know, when we do these long broadcasts, I usually have somebody come in and talk about fluoride.
[00:43:59.252 --> 00:44:03.096]  Linda Green is a big anti-fluoridation activist here in town.
[00:44:03.196 --> 00:44:04.497]  I've had her on a couple times.
[00:44:05.959 --> 00:44:09.543]  And it's amazing when you go to the water treatment plant.
[00:44:10.629 --> 00:44:12.189]  And they show you around.
[00:44:12.269 --> 00:44:13.530]  Oh, this is how we do things.
[00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:14.090]  Here it is.
[00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.570]  Blah, blah.
[00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:18.571]  Here's our seven-foot charcoal filter that the water goes through at the end.
[00:44:19.531 --> 00:44:22.952]  And then there's a room off to the side, and it's marked Danger and Do Not Enter.
[00:44:23.712 --> 00:44:31.853]  And it's got MSDS ratings on it, and they're the highest for human reactivity on there.
[00:44:32.514 --> 00:44:34.874]  And you go in, and it's these two purple tanks in there.
[00:44:35.974 --> 00:44:37.475]  And it's not even called fluoride.
[00:44:37.495 --> 00:44:39.435]  It's called hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:44:40.834 --> 00:44:42.955]  And they put it in your water and they say it's for your teeth.
[00:44:44.797 --> 00:44:45.937]  How many teeth you got in your stomach?
[00:44:47.939 --> 00:44:48.079]  Hmm?
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.721]  Or your digestive system?
[00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:51.681]  How many teeth are down there?
[00:44:52.882 --> 00:44:54.843]  If it's for your teeth, why are they having you drink it?
[00:44:57.005 --> 00:44:57.185]  Hmm.
[00:44:58.286 --> 00:44:58.906]  That's interesting.
[00:45:02.929 --> 00:45:06.231]  I'm gonna give out the phone number after our guest... Well, I'll give it out now.
[00:45:07.632 --> 00:45:08.653]  We can load some people up.
[00:45:09.775 --> 00:45:18.597]  My guess is going to come in in 10 minutes.
[00:45:18.617 --> 00:45:18.998]  877-789-2539.
[00:45:19.018 --> 00:45:19.298]  877-789-2539.
[00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:22.539]  The poles have been open for nearly an hour on the East Coast.
[00:45:22.559 --> 00:45:26.340]  They'll be opening in nine minutes here in the Central Time Zone here in Austin, Texas.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:34.902]  And then in an hour in the Mountain Time Zone, an hour after that, and then two hours after that in the Pacific.
[00:45:36.723 --> 00:45:37.823]  And we'll know by the end of the day.
[00:45:38.865 --> 00:45:42.948]  We'll know in about 12-13 hours if the election's going to be really rigged.
[00:45:44.389 --> 00:45:45.309]  Will they stand down?
[00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:47.291]  Will they let the people's voice be heard?
[00:45:49.052 --> 00:45:50.353]  The elites aren't going to go quietly.
[00:45:52.334 --> 00:45:58.238]  But once you show a huge force of will, they will back down.
[00:45:58.258 --> 00:46:02.121]  And when you shine light on their activities, they back down.
[00:46:11.613 --> 00:46:13.754]  There's a Glenn Beck article, Breitbart printed it.
[00:46:13.774 --> 00:46:17.736]  They just printed an excerpt of it, and this is, I think, from the New Yorker.
[00:46:17.776 --> 00:46:21.078]  Glenn Beck tries out decency.
[00:46:21.098 --> 00:46:36.806]  And this goes back to the morning that the locker room talk tape came out that was edited together, and the first lady ripped into Trump's comments, calling them disgraceful, intolerable, and adding, it doesn't matter what party you belong to, no woman deserves to be treated that way.
[00:46:36.826 --> 00:46:40.528]  As she invites rappers to the White House.
[00:46:41.618 --> 00:46:44.180]  Who say things ten times worse.
[00:46:46.301 --> 00:46:47.562]  Who promote gang activity.
[00:46:48.043 --> 00:46:49.183]  Here's the Breitbart version.
[00:46:49.784 --> 00:46:50.744]  I love this picture.
[00:46:50.785 --> 00:46:52.726]  It's got Beck with a face full of Cheetos.
[00:46:53.747 --> 00:46:55.568]  And it says change on top of it.
[00:47:03.339 --> 00:47:10.682]  Those words hit me where I live, Beck said the other day as he was speed-walking up 8th Avenue with his wife, son, daughter, all in from Toronto.
[00:47:10.702 --> 00:47:13.282]  If you're a decent human being, those words were dead-on.
[00:47:14.583 --> 00:47:31.749]  Decency is a fresh palate for Beck, who used to scribble on a chalkboard, launching into conspiratorial rants about looming Weimer-esque hyperinflation, Barack Obama's ties to radicals with population-cleansing schemes, and Marxist-Islamist cabal itching to take over America.
[00:47:32.608 --> 00:47:38.951]  He wants to describe Clinton as a stereotypical bitch and accused Obama of being racist with a deep hatred for white people.
[00:47:42.273 --> 00:47:43.854]  But now, he's a different man.
[00:47:43.894 --> 00:47:53.379]  He wants to go on NPR and go on the left and talk about how he's changed and his ratings are tanking.
[00:47:53.399 --> 00:47:58.042]  Because I think when he saw that he couldn't take over
[00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:02.931]  The right and the people in it.
[00:48:05.251 --> 00:48:09.493]  And when people on the left started calling him out saying, hey man, you're just ripping off Alex Jones.
[00:48:10.433 --> 00:48:11.974]  The whole Rolling Stone article about it.
[00:48:14.694 --> 00:48:15.835]  I think he finally said, you know what?
[00:48:15.855 --> 00:48:16.955]  I'm going to go back to my roots.
[00:48:18.135 --> 00:48:18.856]  And that's what he did.
[00:48:18.876 --> 00:48:23.037]  Let's go to Don from Grand Rapids.
[00:48:24.258 --> 00:48:25.819]  You were at the Trump Grand Rapids Rally.
[00:48:25.859 --> 00:48:26.339]  When was that?
[00:48:26.379 --> 00:48:26.879]  Was it today?
[00:48:27.139 --> 00:48:27.480]  Yesterday?
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:33.863]  Yeah, that was yesterday at about, I think he showed up at around one in the morning, finally got there to talk.
[00:48:34.103 --> 00:48:37.004]  So you saw Ted Nugent play the Star Spangled Banner?
[00:48:37.985 --> 00:48:38.665]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:38.805 --> 00:48:41.666]  He went out there, he did his little Wackmaster thing.
[00:48:41.747 --> 00:48:48.150]  I tell ya, you know, most of those musicians, you know, they always come out with a full band, but Ted Nugent just came out there by himself with a guitar.
[00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:50.571]  Tone sounded really good too, even through the TV.
[00:48:50.631 --> 00:48:52.432]  I'm like, man, Ted's got the tone.
[00:48:53.527 --> 00:48:56.588]  Yeah, he kept it going pretty good, man, I tell you.
[00:48:56.608 --> 00:48:57.709]  Who are you voting for?
[00:48:57.729 --> 00:48:59.009]  Real quick, Don, who are you voting for?
[00:48:59.709 --> 00:49:00.930]  Who's doing the chumpster, man?
[00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:02.771]  Donny Mann from the block!
[00:49:03.591 --> 00:49:03.951]  You know?
[00:49:04.351 --> 00:49:04.571]  Yeah.
[00:49:06.232 --> 00:49:07.432]  Like, there's no other candidate.
[00:49:07.472 --> 00:49:12.414]  You know, it's like when Pence was speaking in his speech, he said, Negotiator in Chief, you know?
[00:49:13.375 --> 00:49:20.737]  It's like this is the last chance we get because these Democrats have pretty much taken as much as they could possibly take.
[00:49:21.718 --> 00:49:22.218]  You know what I mean?
[00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:27.589]  And at the Trump Rally yesterday, there was easily 20,000 people there.
[00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:41.500]  The line went from the DeVos Hall all the way across the Grand River, wrapped back around in Avalon Park, and a majority of the people that were there were actually, like, shoot, probably, uh, from between, like, 20 and 35.
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.521]  You know, it's a small, pretty much town.
[00:49:43.541 --> 00:49:51.367]  You know, there's not a lot of people here, but for all those people to stay there until 2.30 in the morning to watch a possible presidential candidate speak,
[00:49:52.338 --> 00:49:53.299]  You know, that says a lot.
[00:49:53.379 --> 00:49:54.899]  And you can tell Trump is tired.
[00:49:54.919 --> 00:49:56.680]  Because, you know, he was in Florida.
[00:49:57.021 --> 00:49:57.221]  Yeah.
[00:49:57.481 --> 00:49:58.181]  That very morning.
[00:49:58.401 --> 00:50:00.402]  He did four or five events that day.
[00:50:00.783 --> 00:50:01.243]  Yesterday.
[00:50:02.544 --> 00:50:03.704]  You know, and that shows a lot.
[00:50:03.744 --> 00:50:09.707]  You know, a lot of people haven't done that since, you know, back in the day when they would just go all around the place canvassing.
[00:50:10.608 --> 00:50:14.450]  You know, and he showed up tired, but, you know, once you look around in that room, dude, it was...
[00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.601]  Yeah, you get the energy.
[00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:19.122]  Trump events are amazing.
[00:50:20.042 --> 00:50:21.323]  And, you know, I've been to a lot of them.
[00:50:21.684 --> 00:50:23.165]  I've never been inside one.
[00:50:23.185 --> 00:50:25.126]  I've always been outside covering them.
[00:50:25.726 --> 00:50:28.709]  But the energy outside is amazing.
[00:50:28.729 --> 00:50:31.591]  The energy outside is cool, man.
[00:50:32.231 --> 00:50:35.754]  The Social Justice Warriors, I've finally seen one of those for the first time.
[00:50:35.774 --> 00:50:36.434]  Yeah.
[00:50:36.594 --> 00:50:40.097]  And, like, their signs, they look like first graders did them.
[00:50:40.157 --> 00:50:41.738]  It was the craziest thing, man.
[00:50:42.739 --> 00:50:43.179]  I tell ya.
[00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:53.355]  But, you know, I just want to give my input on it that I think, you know, Michigan is definitely going to go Republican considering how many people were there and, you know, the age group.
[00:50:53.955 --> 00:50:57.658]  Because, you know, Hillary did her canvassing in Michigan at college campuses.
[00:50:57.838 --> 00:51:02.880]  You know, the majority of these people, they had to come from out of town and get into Grand Rapids.
[00:51:04.201 --> 00:51:06.302]  They even called it their Democratic safe space.
[00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:12.301]  People talk about the Millennials a lot and how important they are to the election, or young people in general.
[00:51:12.781 --> 00:51:14.122]  Every time there's an election.
[00:51:14.202 --> 00:51:15.283]  Oh, we gotta get the young people out.
[00:51:15.703 --> 00:51:16.924]  Young people just don't go out and vote.
[00:51:16.944 --> 00:51:17.484]  I don't know why.
[00:51:17.584 --> 00:51:18.285]  They just don't do it.
[00:51:19.365 --> 00:51:19.805]  I did.
[00:51:19.986 --> 00:51:22.847]  It's the first time I voted in every election.
[00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:28.031]  Even though I do think it's a rigged system.
[00:51:30.212 --> 00:51:33.274]  But most of the time I was voting for Ron Paul or the Libertarian candidate.
[00:51:37.475 --> 00:51:38.596]  Alright Don, thanks for calling.
[00:51:39.376 --> 00:51:41.338]  Let's go to Thomas in Texas.
[00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:45.741]  You don't think the Trump campaign knows about fraction magic?
[00:51:47.743 --> 00:51:49.164]  No sir, I don't think they do.
[00:51:49.184 --> 00:52:05.095]  I'm worried about that because I think that if the election goes towards Hillary in the middle of it somewhere because of the rigging that I'm just worried that Trump might pressure to concede or something before he actually
[00:52:06.692 --> 00:52:11.593]  I don't think he knows about Facts and Magic.
[00:52:11.633 --> 00:52:16.154]  I think the RNC and Trump's campaign need to be really versed in this.
[00:52:16.234 --> 00:52:23.516]  I've sent them emails with links about this to Bev Harris' videos, and they don't respond.
[00:52:23.536 --> 00:52:29.897]  I don't know that they even read this email I sent them, so I'm really hoping that somebody can get through to them.
[00:52:30.438 --> 00:52:37.583]  Well, there's a lot of people hitting Trump from a lot of sides, and I'm sure Roger Stone's aware of Fraction Magic.
[00:52:37.643 --> 00:52:38.924]  I'm sure he's brought it up to him.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.622]  And they're trying their ways.
[00:52:42.662 --> 00:52:47.125]  I mean, he's come out and said the system is rigged, and he's stuck by that, even though he's been attacked.
[00:52:47.585 --> 00:52:48.446]  It's funny how they attack him.
[00:52:48.486 --> 00:52:50.587]  It's not rigged, it's not rigged, but the Russians are going to do it.
[00:52:50.868 --> 00:52:54.390]  It's not rigged, it's not rigged, but the Russians are going to take away your vote.
[00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:59.314]  The Russians are going to give it to Trump because Trump's a Russian agent, even though Hillary's the one who's done deals with the Russians.
[00:52:59.934 --> 00:53:01.375]  Trump doesn't even do deals with the Russians.
[00:53:02.396 --> 00:53:04.077]  Real quick, who are you voting for?
[00:53:04.097 --> 00:53:05.018]  President Biden.
[00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:06.199]  What was that?
[00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:18.681]  Isn't it amazing how they seized on that Russian thing when the only connection that we know of for sure is that Hillary managed a 20% transfer of our uranium to Russian oligarchs and then the government bought that over there.
[00:53:19.782 --> 00:53:21.403]  But there's no voter rigging, it's the Russians.
[00:53:22.044 --> 00:53:23.445]  There's no election fraud, it's the Russians.
[00:53:24.146 --> 00:53:24.326]  Right.
[00:53:24.426 --> 00:53:25.868]  There's no voter fraud, it's the Russians.
[00:53:26.929 --> 00:53:27.990]  You know, it's all happening.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:37.345]  I don't understand how they can, you know, what scares me is these generals that get really, like Millie, they get real belligerent.
[00:53:37.365 --> 00:53:40.587]  We will beat you down harder than you've ever been beat before.
[00:53:41.427 --> 00:53:44.769]  What kind of talk is that and where does the Pentagon have the right to say that?
[00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:46.090]  I don't understand.
[00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:49.011]  Boy, that guy was on fire.
[00:53:49.612 --> 00:53:50.332]  He was too much.
[00:53:51.132 --> 00:53:52.973]  Hold on, hold on, real quick.
[00:53:52.993 --> 00:53:55.075]  Who are you voting for?
[00:53:55.235 --> 00:53:56.295]  Donald Trump, of course.
[00:53:56.375 --> 00:53:57.436]  And you're going to go vote, right?
[00:53:58.976 --> 00:54:00.356]  You're going to vote today, right?
[00:54:01.097 --> 00:54:02.537]  I'm about to vote in another hour, yes.
[00:54:02.857 --> 00:54:03.217]  Excellent.
[00:54:04.458 --> 00:54:04.698]  Excellent.
[00:54:04.718 --> 00:54:05.918]  Hey, how are you listening to us?
[00:54:08.539 --> 00:54:11.920]  I'm watching all your live coverage right now.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:12.621]  Excellent.
[00:54:12.681 --> 00:54:15.482]  On forward slash show or on Facebook or on YouTube?
[00:54:15.502 --> 00:54:16.022]  How are you doing it?
[00:54:16.602 --> 00:54:17.342]  Forward slash show.
[00:54:17.962 --> 00:54:18.302]  Excellent.
[00:54:18.723 --> 00:54:19.943]  Alright, well spread the link, buddy.
[00:54:20.303 --> 00:54:21.524]  You got anything else to add real quick?
[00:54:21.584 --> 00:54:22.764]  I'm going to go to a quick break.
[00:54:23.724 --> 00:54:25.325]  Well, thank you for letting me get on.
[00:54:25.345 --> 00:54:25.925]  I appreciate you.
[00:54:26.185 --> 00:54:27.406]  Alright, Tom, just get out there and vote.
[00:54:27.666 --> 00:54:28.566]  Bring some people to vote.
[00:54:30.283 --> 00:54:32.344]  Um, hang out a little bit.
[00:54:34.366 --> 00:54:35.466]  Larry Nichols said, hang out.
[00:54:35.486 --> 00:54:36.767]  Tell them you're poll watching.
[00:54:38.328 --> 00:54:41.450]  Then if they're going to do anything, they'll leave and go to another place.
[00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:42.951]  Love Larry Nichols.
[00:54:43.651 --> 00:54:44.392]  Good job, Larry.
[00:54:44.492 --> 00:54:48.414]  Larry, you know, he could give up and say, I'm just going to sit this one out.
[00:54:49.294 --> 00:54:52.356]  But he knows what the Clintons are made of and what we're up against.
[00:54:53.377 --> 00:54:57.499]  So, guys, queue up like a three minute break and we'll get our guest in here.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:58.260]  You ready to go?
[00:54:59.318 --> 00:54:59.899]  All right, let's roll it.
[00:54:59.919 --> 00:55:01.140]  We'll be right back after this short break.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:06.345]  Now, before we go to break, go to Infowars.com forward slash show and check out the deals we have 30 to 40% off.
[00:55:08.892 --> 00:55:16.898]  Uh, of the InfoWare Select Storable Food, 30% off CNA Force, 30% off Supermail Vitality, and free shipping, and free shipping, and free shipping.
[00:55:17.418 --> 00:55:18.379]  All that and free shipping.
[00:55:18.899 --> 00:55:24.903]  30% off Pure Cane Water Filters, 25% off Secret 12, 15% off all Mullen LaBae apparel.
[00:55:25.444 --> 00:55:29.286]  That's the belt buckles, and the t-shirts, and the hats.
[00:55:30.847 --> 00:55:32.609]  It's how we fund this operation.
[00:55:33.689 --> 00:55:37.012]  There's no money coming from the government to fund this operation.
[00:55:38.763 --> 00:55:39.843]  We're not a non-profit.
[00:55:41.744 --> 00:55:44.585]  And we take the profits that we do make.
[00:55:45.346 --> 00:55:47.086]  And when it's these big sales, we don't get a lot.
[00:55:47.147 --> 00:55:49.127]  So we need more people to jump in.
[00:55:49.147 --> 00:55:50.928]  We need more people to send out the link.
[00:55:50.948 --> 00:55:52.429]  We need to keep growing the audience.
[00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:56.070]  Everybody needs to get healthy.
[00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:59.832]  And we need to take our country back.
[00:56:03.653 --> 00:56:05.374]  And with that, we'll go to break, and we'll be right back.
[00:56:05.434 --> 00:56:06.074]  Infowars.com.
[00:56:06.094 --> 00:56:06.735]  Forwars slash show.
[00:56:06.755 --> 00:56:07.235]  Spread the link.
[00:56:24.116 --> 00:56:33.206]  If you can't see the irony in having a gun ban enforced by men with guns, well then you fail to understand why the Second Amendment was written in the first place.
[00:56:33.246 --> 00:56:36.090]  Throughout history, only slaves are disarmed.
[00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:40.034]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[00:56:40.094 --> 00:56:41.174]  The right of the people.
[00:56:41.214 --> 00:56:42.415]  The right of the people.
[00:56:42.495 --> 00:56:43.395]  The right of the people.
[00:56:43.475 --> 00:56:45.916]  To keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:56:45.976 --> 00:56:54.878]  For all of you actors out there who go to your red carpet events, surrounded by full battle rattle SWAT teams, while you accept your awards for your latest violent movie.
[00:56:55.198 --> 00:57:06.501]  For all you politicians who spend your 9-5 days scheming up ways to take away my Second Amendment rights, meanwhile you have first responders on site there to protect you, I say this, come and take it.
[00:57:06.681 --> 00:57:09.062]  I have a strict gun control policy.
[00:57:09.622 --> 00:57:12.227]  If there's a gun around, I want to control it.
[00:57:12.868 --> 00:57:13.549]  Clint Eastwood.
[00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:14.311]  Go ahead.
[00:57:15.352 --> 00:57:16.234]  Make my day.
[00:57:16.414 --> 00:57:21.704]  Dads demand guns because it's me that's got to get up and go check out that noise at 2 a.m.
[00:57:24.298 --> 00:57:29.560]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words, and his was action.
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:31.661]  His was what he's done to women.
[00:57:31.701 --> 00:57:37.382]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[00:57:37.603 --> 00:57:39.903]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[00:57:40.263 --> 00:57:46.445]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[00:57:46.586 --> 00:57:51.867]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[00:58:02.714 --> 00:58:05.457]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:58:06.317 --> 00:58:07.779]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:58:08.439 --> 00:58:10.381]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:58:10.702 --> 00:58:14.905]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:58:15.046 --> 00:58:18.409]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:58:18.489 --> 00:58:20.010]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:58:24.341 --> 00:58:24.821]  Not a group.
[00:58:24.841 --> 00:58:26.262]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:58:26.302 --> 00:58:27.383]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:58:27.643 --> 00:58:28.563]  Why is this so good?
[00:58:28.844 --> 00:58:34.086]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:58:34.166 --> 00:58:47.734]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:58:47.794 --> 00:58:49.155]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:58:49.935 --> 00:58:51.536]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:58:51.596 --> 00:58:54.076]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:58:54.176 --> 00:58:55.437]  These are all parasites.
[00:58:55.477 --> 00:58:56.597]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:58:56.617 --> 00:58:57.637]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:58:57.937 --> 00:59:02.259]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:59:02.459 --> 00:59:05.640]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:08.821]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:59:08.861 --> 00:59:09.841]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:59:09.901 --> 00:59:10.421]  Living Defense.
[00:59:10.721 --> 00:59:11.762]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:11.822 --> 00:59:12.842]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:59:12.862 --> 00:59:14.943]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:59:15.603 --> 00:59:15.823]  And, uh...
[00:59:16.483 --> 00:59:17.443]  You support the broadcast.
[00:59:17.503 --> 00:59:18.644]  Infowarslive.com.
[00:59:18.864 --> 00:59:20.764]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:23.105]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:59:24.565 --> 00:59:25.566]  BrainForce is here.
[00:59:26.106 --> 00:59:28.367]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:59:28.647 --> 00:59:36.429]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:59:37.219 --> 00:59:40.321]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:59:40.641 --> 00:59:40.781]  Right?
[00:59:40.801 --> 00:59:43.163]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:59:43.523 --> 00:59:47.026]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:59:47.066 --> 00:59:50.228]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:59:50.728 --> 00:59:55.571]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:59:56.072 --> 00:59:57.893]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:59:58.253 --> 01:00:02.676]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:04.838]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:06.919]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:00:07.079 --> 01:00:07.319]  Exactly.
[01:00:07.339 --> 01:00:11.123]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:00:11.643 --> 01:00:18.890]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:19.631]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[01:00:36.857 --> 01:00:37.417]  Welcome back!
[01:00:37.477 --> 01:00:40.438]  We are live here in our 52-hour broadcast.
[01:00:40.538 --> 01:00:41.678]  So it's 7 a.m.
[01:00:41.718 --> 01:00:47.199]  now, 7.06 actually, and at 3 p.m.
[01:00:47.219 --> 01:00:49.219]  today we'll have another 24 hours left.
[01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:50.660]  And I can't do the math right now.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.320]  I am too tired.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.321]  I went home at 1.30, took a three-hour nap, went through one full cycle of sleep.
[01:00:57.281 --> 01:01:00.682]  I actually woke up after dreaming and said, ah, it's time to get up.
[01:01:01.842 --> 01:01:02.862]  Time to make the donuts.
[01:01:04.508 --> 01:01:06.669]  My guest is Rev.
[01:01:06.689 --> 01:01:09.611]  Dr. David W. Peters, who was an Army chaplain.
[01:01:09.631 --> 01:01:11.913]  He was deployed to Baghdad and Iraq in 2005.
[01:01:12.533 --> 01:01:15.275]  He's written a couple books, one of which is being made into a movie.
[01:01:17.316 --> 01:01:19.758]  That book is Death Letter, God, Sex, and War.
[01:01:20.618 --> 01:01:23.140]  And he's got a new book out called Post-Traumatic God.
[01:01:24.441 --> 01:01:27.943]  And he does a lot of work with soldiers with PTSD.
[01:01:28.723 --> 01:01:30.705]  After serving in Iraq, he then
[01:01:31.874 --> 01:01:35.897]  Went to a medical hospital, which one was that?
[01:01:37.578 --> 01:01:38.319]  Walter Reed.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.023]  And helped guys who were suffering from these traumatic injuries from going to war.
[01:01:44.824 --> 01:01:45.884]  And so he's seen a lot.
[01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:47.926]  He's talked to a lot of people.
[01:01:49.147 --> 01:01:50.388]  He's a very serious guy.
[01:01:51.769 --> 01:01:56.873]  And, um, his assistant rector at St.
[01:01:57.193 --> 01:02:01.096]  Mark's Episcopal Church in Austin, Texas for the last year and I guess year and a half.
[01:02:02.365 --> 01:02:10.218]  And I asked him to come in and essentially start off, I want to start off, the polls have just opened in the Central Time Zone.
[01:02:12.827 --> 01:02:13.588]  We need a blessing.
[01:02:13.608 --> 01:02:15.049]  We need to start this day off right.
[01:02:15.609 --> 01:02:16.870]  Let's get a blessing on the day.
[01:02:17.251 --> 01:02:19.472]  Blessing that there's no cheating.
[01:02:19.613 --> 01:02:20.373]  Every vote counts.
[01:02:20.633 --> 01:02:22.275]  I'm going to let him give the blessing.
[01:02:22.735 --> 01:02:24.597]  David, how are you doing today?
[01:02:24.817 --> 01:02:25.377]  Doing great.
[01:02:25.478 --> 01:02:25.958]  Doing great.
[01:02:27.239 --> 01:02:33.464]  This is a prayer that was written long before the current election.
[01:02:33.845 --> 01:02:36.947]  I think it goes back to maybe the 60s, around the time of the Vietnam War.
[01:02:37.708 --> 01:02:38.509]  This prayer was written.
[01:02:38.529 --> 01:02:39.629]  It's in our prayer book.
[01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.431]  Do you mind if we start now?
[01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:42.952]  Go ahead.
[01:02:42.972 --> 01:02:43.472]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:43.792 --> 01:02:44.273]  Let's pray.
[01:02:44.293 --> 01:03:05.147]  Almighty God, to whom we must account for all our powers and privileges, guide the people of the United States in the election of a president, of officials, and representatives, that by faithful administration and wise laws, the rights of all may be protected, and our nation be enabled to fulfill your purposes.
[01:03:05.667 --> 01:03:07.168]  Through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[01:03:07.188 --> 01:03:07.948]  Amen.
[01:03:07.968 --> 01:03:08.129]  Amen.
[01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:12.811]  Well, that was short and to the point.
[01:03:13.311 --> 01:03:13.971]  It is, yeah.
[01:03:14.231 --> 01:03:14.731]  I liked it.
[01:03:15.632 --> 01:03:16.132]  Fulfill?
[01:03:16.152 --> 01:03:17.092]  What was that?
[01:03:17.112 --> 01:03:19.693]  Fulfill the purpose of God's intentions?
[01:03:20.273 --> 01:03:25.094]  Yeah, it's that we all be enabled to fulfill God's purposes.
[01:03:25.174 --> 01:03:25.654]  God's purpose.
[01:03:25.674 --> 01:03:29.976]  And that leaves a little mystery there of what those purposes are.
[01:03:31.854 --> 01:03:33.915]  I think a lot of people are asking that today.
[01:03:33.935 --> 01:03:35.497]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:03:35.517 --> 01:03:38.118]  We're definitely at a crossroads.
[01:03:38.399 --> 01:03:41.781]  I mean, at this point I think it could go either way.
[01:03:41.801 --> 01:03:49.767]  I personally think it's going to be a Trump landslide if the powers that be let it go forth and let the will of the people go through.
[01:03:50.527 --> 01:04:00.474]  What have you seen, just by living in Austin, very liberal, I imagine Hillary Clinton's going to win this area, even though I haven't seen a ton of Hillary Clinton support outwardly.
[01:04:03.241 --> 01:04:11.428]  What have you seen in your travels in this last year and what are your thoughts on the election and what it's doing to our country, essentially?
[01:04:12.729 --> 01:04:20.075]  I live here in Austin and so certainly here there's a certainly a leaning towards Hillary Clinton, I think.
[01:04:20.936 --> 01:04:25.779]  But I also stay in touch with veterans that I served with in Iraq and other places as well.
[01:04:25.819 --> 01:04:31.844]  I know in the veteran community there is a lot of passion about this election.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:40.526]  Certainly, those of us who have participated in the wars that have gone on since really our childhoods.
[01:04:41.587 --> 01:04:50.775]  This has been a really long series of wars that I think is being lived out in some way in this election cycle.
[01:04:51.475 --> 01:04:52.876]  I think the anxiety of
[01:04:53.957 --> 01:05:01.119]  A nation at war that I know when I came back from Iraq, I felt like I came back to a world that I didn't recognize.
[01:05:01.819 --> 01:05:11.982]  I felt like, and I hear this from a lot of other veterans too, that America is really superficial, that all we care about is consuming more stuff and buying more things.
[01:05:12.182 --> 01:05:17.684]  And yet, knowing that a war is raging in Iraq and Afghanistan and other places as well,
[01:05:18.704 --> 01:05:42.233]  Really felt I felt really disconnected from my country in many ways I know a lot of other other veterans feel that way and And I my goal in life since I survived Iraq is to bring reconciliation to people that are that feel distant from from other things so I think veterans need to find that reconciliation and I hope this
[01:05:43.413 --> 01:05:55.760]  I hope after today and tomorrow and into this week we can go into Veterans Day, which is Friday, a celebration of the end of World War I, a celebration of life.
[01:05:56.581 --> 01:06:03.605]  Veterans Day is about people who survived the war and to see what good can I do in the world now that I've survived this event.
[01:06:04.721 --> 01:06:10.065]  Yeah, my father-in-law's a Vietnam vet, and he doesn't talk about it a lot, and he was an MP.
[01:06:10.805 --> 01:06:20.613]  So he probably didn't see a lot of jungle action, but he saw, I'm sure, another side of it, dealing with, you know, people he had to deal with and whatnot, but he doesn't talk about it.
[01:06:20.673 --> 01:06:25.997]  You find people who've gone there, it's hard for them to talk about what they've seen and what they've experienced.
[01:06:26.977 --> 01:06:32.982]  How were you able to, I guess, provide an avenue to open up, to get people to open up and talk about it?
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:34.881]  I tried to listen.
[01:06:35.421 --> 01:06:42.866]  Paul Tillich, who I write about in this new book, was a World War I Army chaplain, and he said the first task of love is listening.
[01:06:43.546 --> 01:07:00.498]  And listening to people, hearing their story, hearing their anger, hearing their frustration, something I tried to get good at when I was at Walter Reed with the Wounded Warriors, working on the psych ward there, with people who had been severely affected physically and mentally and emotionally and spiritually by war.
[01:07:00.518 --> 01:07:01.678]  I think that
[01:07:02.899 --> 01:07:12.588]  I really think that telling the story is one part of the healing process, just getting a veteran or soldier to open up that way.
[01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:17.692]  But there's also another step, which is to then start creating something in the world that brings healing.
[01:07:18.473 --> 01:07:33.325]  We've been doing art projects with veterans, where they paint, they write, and that's something that helped me open up, was a writing group I was in at Walter Reed, where we would just kind of bring something every day, no matter how dark it was and how horrible it sounded, and we'd read it.
[01:07:33.565 --> 01:07:40.170]  And the group would affirm each other in that, and that's how I kind of learned how to open up in that way.
[01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:41.631]  That's my first book, Death Letter, was
[01:07:42.432 --> 01:07:43.092]  We're good to go.
[01:07:58.134 --> 01:08:10.544]  I think working at Walter Reed with a whole staff of medical professionals and chaplains and others who really cared about the wounded men and women, there was something about cleaning up the mess of a war.
[01:08:11.325 --> 01:08:15.088]  Helping to clean up the lives that were affected by war that had a profound effect.
[01:08:15.148 --> 01:08:17.690]  The mental and spiritual mess in addition to the physical.
[01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:20.052]  Yeah, it hits you in three different areas.
[01:08:20.352 --> 01:08:25.516]  We have a vet who served in Iraq and Afghanistan here, Joe Biggs, he was a staff sergeant.
[01:08:26.457 --> 01:08:32.642]  And he's been in two explosions where his Humvee hit an IED.
[01:08:33.803 --> 01:08:38.287]  And among other things that he's seen, guys, suicide bombers running at him.
[01:08:39.788 --> 01:08:41.730]  And a lot of what he tells us from his perspective,
[01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:50.527]  But when we go to war, there's a whole other country that's being affected, or countries being affected.
[01:08:50.907 --> 01:08:55.190]  People that had nothing to do with the reason we're there being affected.
[01:08:56.331 --> 01:09:00.935]  Did you have a lot of interaction with the locals in the area you were at?
[01:09:01.556 --> 01:09:03.517]  And what were their feelings towards
[01:09:04.497 --> 01:09:10.802]  I arrived right when we had been very successful in the campaign in Iraq and we were kind of feeling like this is going to be a pretty easy deployment.
[01:09:27.375 --> 01:09:35.179]  When I was there in Baghdad, the civil war started between the Sunni and Shia populations that kind of divided the city there.
[01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:42.202]  And right away, I think the military realized that this is a whole different situation.
[01:09:43.162 --> 01:09:46.904]  So it went from bad to worse really fast during my time, 05-06.
[01:09:48.905 --> 01:09:54.968]  Historically, that was the time where it looked like things were going to spin out of control in a way that no one expected.
[01:09:56.156 --> 01:09:59.821]  So my interactions with the Iraqi people were very limited.
[01:09:59.901 --> 01:10:04.587]  We lived in a very secure forward operating base, a very large one.
[01:10:05.248 --> 01:10:11.115]  But when we would interact with people, I noticed that people are real polite when you have a lot of guns, and we did.
[01:10:12.779 --> 01:10:14.720]  And I always wondered what their feelings were.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:22.882]  A lot of my perceptions of how people felt about us were just from watching people stare at our convoys as we drove by.
[01:10:22.903 --> 01:10:30.525]  And I think that we had a profound effect on that region of the world in the U.S.
[01:10:30.565 --> 01:10:31.105]  military.
[01:10:31.265 --> 01:10:37.988]  And I think a lot of that is, I think we're realizing how difficult it is to fix things through war.
[01:10:39.048 --> 01:10:40.908]  I'm certainly not a pacifist.
[01:10:41.609 --> 01:10:42.749]  I served in the military.
[01:10:42.849 --> 01:10:50.070]  I do believe there is a time for war and a time for peace, but I also know that war doesn't solve all our problems.
[01:10:51.011 --> 01:10:57.112]  We often have a psychological and emotional need to do something when we've been hurt, when we've been wronged.
[01:10:57.852 --> 01:11:04.753]  And war can be a response to that, but I don't think it results in more peace often.
[01:11:04.773 --> 01:11:06.834]  And certainly this is a good example of that.
[01:11:08.214 --> 01:11:12.317]  We have soldiers deploying right now to Iraq and to Afghanistan.
[01:11:12.898 --> 01:11:16.921]  I think the United States as a whole, we don't really know what's happening.
[01:11:17.081 --> 01:11:20.123]  We kind of don't want to know what's happening in a lot of ways.
[01:11:20.483 --> 01:11:24.246]  Yeah, it's like we gave it its due process in the beginning.
[01:11:24.587 --> 01:11:25.287]  Rah, rah, rah.
[01:11:25.307 --> 01:11:26.488]  We're sending the soldiers off.
[01:11:26.788 --> 01:11:30.031]  And I saw this during the first Gulf War.
[01:11:30.071 --> 01:11:31.592]  I was in high school at the time.
[01:11:33.513 --> 01:11:39.659]  My mom made sure, oh this is not how, you know, we didn't treat the troops like this in Vietnam and now we're gonna make sure we do it right this time.
[01:11:39.679 --> 01:11:42.201]  We're going to treat them good and, you know...
[01:11:44.927 --> 01:11:50.710]  Yeah, the first, the Gulf War wasn't much of a, it was a lot different war than Vietnam.
[01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:55.091]  It wasn't as long as, there was a stop, there was a goal.
[01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:57.152]  They reached the goal and they said, okay, we're done.
[01:11:57.933 --> 01:12:03.615]  There wasn't this, we're going to stay and we're going to occupy and change the government.
[01:12:04.175 --> 01:12:06.316]  And you know, I think George Bush made the right decision.
[01:12:06.576 --> 01:12:12.459]  And he said at the time, you know, if we go in there, we're going to create a lot more problems.
[01:12:14.284 --> 01:12:15.044]  Then we're going to solve.
[01:12:15.925 --> 01:12:21.006]  And as bad as Saddam Hussein was, he did at least keep these warring factions at bay from each other.
[01:12:21.026 --> 01:12:24.587]  Because once we went in, it got out of control.
[01:12:25.248 --> 01:12:29.029]  And that was a definite byproduct of us invading.
[01:12:29.069 --> 01:12:39.272]  And ISIS is a direct byproduct of us invading, along with, you know, supplying them and letting the Saudis supply them with weapons.
[01:12:39.312 --> 01:12:41.153]  And we knew that that was going on.
[01:12:43.055 --> 01:12:44.056]  Let's get into your first book.
[01:12:44.916 --> 01:12:48.318]  The reviews are pretty outstanding.
[01:12:48.518 --> 01:12:49.659]  It's five-star reviews.
[01:12:49.999 --> 01:12:58.364]  The first one on here is from a Vietnam vet who he said he's overwhelmed by what he's read and he's amazed that you had the courage to publish this.
[01:12:59.545 --> 01:13:02.566]  So this to you is a big cathartic exercise.
[01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:10.351]  I guess what's your advice to, it's got a 91% five-star rating which is
[01:13:10.996 --> 01:13:12.197]  A few one stars, too.
[01:13:13.478 --> 01:13:13.778]  A few.
[01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:15.319]  Three percent.
[01:13:15.339 --> 01:13:17.140]  That's how you know something's having an effect.
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:19.221]  No two stars, though.
[01:13:19.241 --> 01:13:19.362]  Right.
[01:13:19.442 --> 01:13:20.142]  No two stars.
[01:13:20.182 --> 01:13:23.204]  So people either really, really, really like it and a few don't like it.
[01:13:23.564 --> 01:13:23.644]  Sure.
[01:13:23.664 --> 01:13:26.286]  The book is brutally honest and savagely funny.
[01:13:27.167 --> 01:13:28.568]  I was laughing while I was cringed.
[01:13:29.308 --> 01:13:30.169]  While I cringed.
[01:13:33.151 --> 01:13:34.511]  So I haven't read your book.
[01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:35.212]  What would
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:39.041]  What would make you want to write this and publish this?
[01:13:39.121 --> 01:13:44.223]  And then, I mean, obviously it's got, you know, people love the honesty and brutality of it.
[01:13:46.664 --> 01:13:47.764]  You know, go into your book a little.
[01:13:48.345 --> 01:13:56.348]  Yeah, when I got back from Iraq and I was at Walter Reed and doing some of this writing group, I was trying to find other books that I could read that
[01:13:57.353 --> 01:13:58.494]  That resonated with me.
[01:13:58.534 --> 01:14:06.478]  I think when we're in a transition, I think a lot of people search for something that kind of says, well, I'm not the first person to have this experience.
[01:14:06.658 --> 01:14:14.122]  And so I read a lot of memoirs from chaplains in Vietnam, World War II, and some other situations.
[01:14:14.142 --> 01:14:16.264]  They were often written about 30 or 20 years later.
[01:14:19.139 --> 01:14:31.482]  And so when they get to these parts about their marriages and their home life and their and suicide and all these kind of really dark, intense things, there was a glossing over of those times just because they had healed and had been 20 years ago.
[01:14:31.562 --> 01:14:35.402]  And there'd be vague references to a suicide attempt.
[01:14:35.542 --> 01:14:41.704]  They didn't say who, probably them, and certain things about their marriage that they didn't want to discuss.
[01:14:42.964 --> 01:14:44.385]  And I was like, that's not helping me.
[01:14:44.425 --> 01:14:47.406]  I want to know if I'm the first person to feel this way.
[01:14:47.847 --> 01:14:55.131]  I noticed that the chaplains and caregivers, the nurses, doctors around me at Walter Reed were going through some really intense struggles.
[01:14:55.751 --> 01:15:06.017]  So I felt like, well, if no one else is going to write this book about what it's like in the moment to go through a transition of spiritual transformation, of the loss of safety,
[01:15:06.997 --> 01:15:10.441]  And for me, it was a real feeling of betrayal by God.
[01:15:10.501 --> 01:15:13.465]  I felt like God had abandoned me in my moment of need.
[01:15:14.106 --> 01:15:16.048]  And I felt like nobody cared.
[01:15:16.489 --> 01:15:18.171]  And so I wrote that.
[01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:21.895]  And a lot of it for me was after going through a divorce.
[01:15:23.176 --> 01:15:30.379]  Working out my relationship with women, my relationship with the universe, my relationship with God, and it wasn't always pretty.
[01:15:30.399 --> 01:15:35.901]  It was full of hurt feelings and missteps and that's what I chronicled in this book.
[01:15:35.921 --> 01:15:38.922]  And that's why people say it's honest because it's about sex.
[01:15:40.082 --> 01:15:43.643]  It's hard to write about sex because it's a deeply personal thing.
[01:15:44.023 --> 01:15:44.904]  And you don't find a lot of
[01:15:46.044 --> 01:15:47.665]  Preachers writing about sex?
[01:15:48.125 --> 01:15:48.766]  You don't!
[01:15:51.568 --> 01:15:56.751]  And I felt like that was where the wound was.
[01:15:56.851 --> 01:15:59.613]  The word trauma is the Greek word for wound.
[01:16:00.373 --> 01:16:06.778]  And the wound was there in my sexual life as much as it was in my physical and spiritual emotional life.
[01:16:08.159 --> 01:16:14.183]  I think war, like you mentioned, those IEDs, those bombs that went off for the soldier here,
[01:16:15.624 --> 01:16:18.006]  War has a shattering effect on a lot of things.
[01:16:18.026 --> 01:16:22.451]  I mean, it shatters bodies, it shatters minds, but it also shatters relationships.
[01:16:23.332 --> 01:16:28.658]  I was unable to have a relationship with another person that was close after Iraq.
[01:16:29.539 --> 01:16:33.002]  I would try and try and I just couldn't get close to anybody.
[01:16:33.973 --> 01:16:36.296]  And I found that was a wound that needed to be healed.
[01:16:36.857 --> 01:16:41.723]  And so my search for healing was chronicled in that book.
[01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:44.787]  It was looking for love in all the wrong places mostly.
[01:16:45.348 --> 01:16:47.110]  But I think that's something people need to do.
[01:16:47.130 --> 01:16:49.653]  And the feedback I got was from
[01:16:51.735 --> 01:17:06.899]  You know, some people that I didn't expect to have gone through some of these transitions, people that are much older, people in their 70s and 80s in my church, would come up to me and say, yeah, I had a time in my life where that happened to me and I had this period of chaos where I didn't know what was going on.
[01:17:07.499 --> 01:17:11.900]  And so I found that I wasn't alone and that was a way to find that out.
[01:17:13.261 --> 01:17:13.421]  Wow.
[01:17:15.126 --> 01:17:20.110]  Our guest is Reverend Dr. David Peters, who was an army chaplain deployed to Iraq back in 2005.
[01:17:20.170 --> 01:17:23.593]  We do have, you want to take some calls?
[01:17:23.633 --> 01:17:23.853]  Sure.
[01:17:24.193 --> 01:17:24.513]  All right.
[01:17:24.994 --> 01:17:27.776]  We got, oh, we got another 37 minutes here.
[01:17:27.796 --> 01:17:28.356]  All right.
[01:17:28.376 --> 01:17:29.257]  52 hours.
[01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:30.077]  Oh, we have the 52 hours.
[01:17:30.097 --> 01:17:30.958]  Let me tell you, we're
[01:17:34.997 --> 01:17:37.679]  You know, the guy that I just came in for, he was supposed to end at 2.
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:39.521]  He was scheduled to end at 2.
[01:17:39.581 --> 01:17:41.423]  First he was going to end at 12, and then he goes, well, I'll just go to 2.
[01:17:42.323 --> 01:17:44.405]  I get in here this morning, he's still going.
[01:17:44.465 --> 01:17:45.066]  Taking calls.
[01:17:46.027 --> 01:17:46.787]  He's a young guy, though.
[01:17:48.088 --> 01:17:49.330]  Let's go to Mike in New York.
[01:17:51.872 --> 01:17:53.974]  Mike, we're doing a little informal U.S.
[01:17:54.034 --> 01:17:54.514]  poll here.
[01:17:54.574 --> 01:17:55.855]  Trump seems to be trouncing.
[01:17:56.236 --> 01:18:00.239]  I don't understand why, but maybe it's because it's an InfoWars-only audience poll.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.001]  Who are you voting for?
[01:18:03.559 --> 01:18:04.300]  Of course Trump, man.
[01:18:05.081 --> 01:18:05.501]  Definitely.
[01:18:06.002 --> 01:18:08.244]  Alright, did you vote yet?
[01:18:08.304 --> 01:18:09.685]  No, I'm going to vote today, later today.
[01:18:10.026 --> 01:18:11.027]  Okay.
[01:18:11.747 --> 01:18:23.399]  So I just wanted to say, like, I really appreciate how you guys at M4s is, you know, getting more into like the spirituality of the battle that we're in now.
[01:18:23.459 --> 01:18:26.182]  Not many, you know, media outlets would ever do anything like this.
[01:18:27.256 --> 01:18:33.962]  So, it's a good thing that you guys are focusing on what's actually important, which is good versus evil right now.
[01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:38.266]  And evil is trying to dominate this world.
[01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:45.353]  I just wanted to say, too, that Owen today, he did a great job.
[01:18:45.793 --> 01:18:46.934]  He did an amazing job.
[01:18:47.275 --> 01:18:52.900]  And I think you... I still remember that day that you hired him, like, on the spot.
[01:18:54.028 --> 01:18:54.668]  Oh yeah.
[01:18:55.489 --> 01:19:01.293]  I think he's like a protege, like an exact carbon copy of Alex Jones, but just of course younger.
[01:19:01.313 --> 01:19:01.393]  Yeah.
[01:19:02.274 --> 01:19:03.274]  And with a lot more energy.
[01:19:03.975 --> 01:19:05.736]  He definitely has a lot of energy.
[01:19:06.156 --> 01:19:07.637]  I can't believe he's still up.
[01:19:07.677 --> 01:19:12.821]  And he's supposed to come back on in a couple hours and do it at least another hour.
[01:19:12.841 --> 01:19:14.602]  If he doesn't make it, I'll just keep going.
[01:19:15.923 --> 01:19:19.886]  No, you do a great job too, but I mean like, Owen was just killing it today.
[01:19:20.026 --> 01:19:21.327]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.925]  He's a lot more Hulkamaniac than I am.
[01:19:26.009 --> 01:19:29.077]  He went a little crazy, but I like that.
[01:19:31.174 --> 01:19:33.375]  Hold on one second, Mike.
[01:19:33.795 --> 01:19:34.316]  I got a question.
[01:19:34.376 --> 01:19:36.276]  He's talking about spirituality.
[01:19:36.837 --> 01:19:38.337]  People don't talk about that a lot.
[01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:45.760]  They kind of leave spirituality for Sunday mornings at church and it's just kind of left there.
[01:19:47.561 --> 01:19:48.822]  Where do you see this country headed?
[01:19:48.842 --> 01:19:52.543]  Do you see us heading in the right direction spiritually or in the wrong direction?
[01:19:52.583 --> 01:19:53.704]  Where do you think we're at right now?
[01:19:54.301 --> 01:20:01.527]  I think when we talk about spirituality, we're talking about our interior life that relates to things that give us meaning.
[01:20:02.668 --> 01:20:06.050]  And right now it's really popular to be spiritual but not religious.
[01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:21.262]  And I think a lot of my generation, Generation X, embraced that as a mantra because it didn't have the formality of a religion and nobody was telling you what to do, especially in areas of sexuality and relationships.
[01:20:21.282 --> 01:20:22.803]  I mean, that's one thing the church has always
[01:20:23.704 --> 01:20:25.689]  Um, really pushed really hard.
[01:20:25.729 --> 01:20:29.238]  There's only one way to do your life and we're going to tell you how to do it.
[01:20:29.379 --> 01:20:29.579]  Right.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:32.206]  And so I think my generation backed away from that.
[01:20:33.112 --> 01:20:38.953]  And so, but there's an emptiness to spiritual but not religious too, because there's no connection.
[01:20:39.153 --> 01:20:44.094]  Religion is about, it's kind of related to the word ligament, to connect something.
[01:20:44.815 --> 01:20:46.375]  And religion connects people.
[01:20:46.395 --> 01:20:52.716]  I like to describe I'm religious but not spiritual, because my interior life is a mess often.
[01:20:52.736 --> 01:20:59.018]  And I think that is expressed in our national conversations about almost every issue.
[01:21:00.118 --> 01:21:02.820]  We have a lot of anxiety as a nation.
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:05.742]  I think that's related to our long wars.
[01:21:06.242 --> 01:21:11.366]  I think our anxiety as a nation comes out in lots of different places.
[01:21:12.707 --> 01:21:15.729]  In family systems theory, there's always an identified patient.
[01:21:16.389 --> 01:21:21.953]  Someone that gets all the fire and everyone's concerned about all the time.
[01:21:22.013 --> 01:21:24.554]  I think we do that as a nation.
[01:21:24.595 --> 01:21:28.637]  So I think we're probably where we have always been as a nation.
[01:21:30.459 --> 01:21:36.425]  When it comes to spirituality and that is searching for something that will give us meaning, purpose, and certainty.
[01:21:37.682 --> 01:21:46.966]  And I found that in the church myself, in that connection to people that I normally wouldn't be connected with socially, because of all the differences.
[01:21:47.066 --> 01:21:55.329]  So, in a church you have people from all different backgrounds, different political backgrounds, and it's a place where we can learn how to pray together.
[01:21:55.349 --> 01:21:59.451]  That's something in the Anglican tradition that was always there in the Church of England.
[01:21:59.931 --> 01:22:05.954]  They were, in England, there was extreme political divides in every area of political life.
[01:22:06.494 --> 01:22:14.662]  And the Church of England was an attempt by leaders and by kings and queens even to get the nation to pray together.
[01:22:14.682 --> 01:22:26.074]  It wasn't always successful, but they tried hard to do that because they felt like uniting around a common practice of prayer was more important than everybody believing the same thing about everything.
[01:22:26.514 --> 01:22:31.396]  Well that, and you're probably not going to start beating each other up if you're praying together two hours before.
[01:22:31.816 --> 01:22:39.159]  You may not agree on an issue, and there's a lot of issues we don't agree on in America, in this country, at all.
[01:22:39.879 --> 01:22:44.221]  And we do have to figure out a way to heal those wounds, bring people together.
[01:22:45.485 --> 01:23:01.156]  Um, and I, and personally, I think the way to do it is to provide more freedom, not more control and, and give people the opportunity to, you know, fulfill their destiny and the things they want to do because, and, and right now I don't feel we're able to do that as, as, as well as we could.
[01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:06.059]  I think there's so much more potential out there in our country and that we can be a leader.
[01:23:06.079 --> 01:23:14.384]  Uh, I was watching, so I usually never watch the ads on YouTube, but this one, it was this, uh, Indian guy talking about when you choose your next president,
[01:23:16.035 --> 01:23:21.759]  You should make them do what you want, in terms of don't let them push their agenda on you.
[01:23:21.799 --> 01:23:22.920]  You tell them what you want.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:30.566]  And he goes, if America went out and instead of sending troops to a place, sent teachers and infrastructure people.
[01:23:32.167 --> 01:23:37.551]  You would create all these people, you would educate the best people, you would find the best people and bring them into your country.
[01:23:38.151 --> 01:23:40.233]  Because we can't take everybody at this point.
[01:23:40.273 --> 01:23:41.474]  We're just not set up to do it.
[01:23:42.532 --> 01:23:44.473]  And that's not the way it should be.
[01:23:44.533 --> 01:23:46.333]  People should be building up their areas.
[01:23:46.973 --> 01:23:56.916]  We should be raising the whole world up to our standard, which our standard isn't the best, but it's come along in terms of freedom and prosperity better than most of the places in the world.
[01:23:58.537 --> 01:24:01.598]  And you've been around the world and seen how the other side lives.
[01:24:02.318 --> 01:24:11.941]  I've only traveled to Europe and a couple of Caribbean nations, but even in the Caribbean, there's massive poverty going on.
[01:24:12.648 --> 01:24:13.491]  And we have poverty here.
[01:24:14.957 --> 01:24:17.506]  And it's hard to come up with all the answers, but...
[01:24:18.394 --> 01:24:25.780]  Like you said, I think if we're all praying together, that's a good start to start fixing some problems.
[01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:28.763]  Have you read any of the Podesta emails?
[01:24:29.684 --> 01:24:31.025]  Did you get into any of that?
[01:24:31.345 --> 01:24:33.007]  I really haven't.
[01:24:33.327 --> 01:24:41.694]  I'm still an Army Reserve officer, and there's a tradition in the Army to not be political in a partisan election way.
[01:24:41.854 --> 01:24:42.074]  Sure.
[01:24:44.925 --> 01:25:07.042]  Everybody's a political creature, but I've always felt like that's something that, and a lot of the voting laws in our nation about what you can and can't do around polling places related to the military because there was so much coercion by military officers to make their own troops vote a certain way or guard polling places.
[01:25:07.062 --> 01:25:08.983]  It's like that with unions too.
[01:25:11.445 --> 01:25:12.766]  Yeah, there was a lot of rules.
[01:25:13.646 --> 01:25:21.729]  And so a lot of the voting laws that protect the freedom to vote in America were because military, and I think around the military didn't vote until the Civil War.
[01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:22.949]  They weren't allowed to.
[01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:30.812]  And then when I think people realized they had a huge army that could vote their candidate in, they allowed.
[01:25:32.433 --> 01:25:33.733]  The soldiers to vote.
[01:25:33.773 --> 01:25:36.974]  So I voted in Baghdad one year.
[01:25:36.994 --> 01:25:39.175]  An absentee ballot.
[01:25:39.735 --> 01:25:43.336]  You know, I kind of wondered if... I don't know if those got counted, actually.
[01:25:43.356 --> 01:25:44.376]  There was a big controversy.
[01:25:44.396 --> 01:25:45.256]  There was, yeah.
[01:25:45.576 --> 01:25:47.357]  So that was, was that Kerry Bush?
[01:25:47.577 --> 01:25:48.377]  I think so.
[01:25:48.397 --> 01:25:48.697]  So that was 04?
[01:25:49.057 --> 01:25:51.758]  Or no, I guess the 09 would have been.
[01:25:51.778 --> 01:25:52.518]  I don't know, when was that?
[01:25:54.042 --> 01:25:55.522]  I don't know if it was a presidential.
[01:25:55.742 --> 01:25:57.563]  I'll have to look that up.
[01:25:57.703 --> 01:26:04.264]  It could have been a midterm, like right after Bush got his second term in.
[01:26:04.544 --> 01:26:17.047]  But yet the military has a voting officer that's appointed to help the soldiers vote and it's really sensitive for military officers and leaders not to disclose who they vote for because
[01:26:18.309 --> 01:26:24.793]  They need to be a leader for everybody, and certainly not be accused of coercing anybody to vote based on their influence.
[01:26:25.433 --> 01:26:29.555]  Now, and I totally respect the fact that you're not getting political.
[01:26:30.175 --> 01:26:31.976]  One person who has, has been the Pope.
[01:26:32.577 --> 01:26:33.717]  The Pope has gotten political.
[01:26:34.117 --> 01:26:44.783]  Do you agree with him, not whether you agree with his stance or not, but do you agree that the Pope should have maybe remained silent on some of these issues, or do you think he did the right thing coming out and speaking his mind?
[01:26:45.396 --> 01:26:52.720]  I'm not a political scientist, and I think the Pope is the head of a state, a sovereign state, the Vatican State.
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:53.820]  Very small state.
[01:26:54.061 --> 01:26:54.641]  Very small.
[01:26:54.721 --> 01:26:55.641]  Very high walls though.
[01:26:55.801 --> 01:27:01.805]  Yeah, and as a Roman Catholic priest, a friend of mine pointed out the other day, that the flag that's in a lot of
[01:27:03.433 --> 01:27:07.635]  Churches that's got the papal seal on it is actually the Vatican flag.
[01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:10.917]  And he's like, you know, a lot of people confuse the two.
[01:27:10.937 --> 01:27:28.706]  So I think, you know, a lot of national leaders around the world have weighed in on our election, which always is a little comical to me to see how easily influenced we are by other sovereign states weighing in on our elections.
[01:27:29.506 --> 01:27:30.267]  The election
[01:27:32.608 --> 01:27:33.208]  So, I don't know.
[01:27:33.228 --> 01:27:34.509]  I mean, he's the Pope.
[01:27:37.431 --> 01:27:43.535]  As an Anglican, we have a lot of affinity towards Rome and a lot of good feelings.
[01:27:43.635 --> 01:27:50.119]  Our Archbishop of Canterbury and Bishop of Texas here just had a visit with the Pope a few weeks ago.
[01:27:50.139 --> 01:27:51.861]  A really collegial visit.
[01:27:51.921 --> 01:27:53.502]  Tried to build cooperation.
[01:27:55.883 --> 01:28:02.729]  I tend to, because of my experience in the military, tend to be pretty politically celibate as best I can.
[01:28:03.369 --> 01:28:05.831]  Politically celibate.
[01:28:05.851 --> 01:28:08.613]  All right, we'll leave the political questions there.
[01:28:08.853 --> 01:28:13.777]  Mike, do you got any questions for Dr., Reverend Dr. David Peters?
[01:28:15.298 --> 01:28:16.659]  No, not really any questions.
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:24.806]  I just want to say that, you know, you don't really need a church to get into heaven or have a relationship with God because that's where you
[01:28:25.581 --> 01:28:31.731]  What's most important is just, you know, have a relationship with Jesus and it doesn't take a church.
[01:28:32.011 --> 01:28:35.316]  You know, you could do it by yourself or do it with a couple of people, you know.
[01:28:37.383 --> 01:28:38.984]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:28:39.064 --> 01:28:39.244]  St.
[01:28:39.264 --> 01:28:43.827]  Augustine said, the church has those whom God has not, and God has those whom the church has not.
[01:28:44.587 --> 01:28:49.270]  And I've found that some churches I've been in were really toxic places for me spiritually.
[01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:52.112]  And others were really life-giving.
[01:28:52.132 --> 01:28:54.353]  So, you know, each community is different.
[01:28:54.393 --> 01:28:55.674]  But I agree with you.
[01:28:55.694 --> 01:28:58.876]  Jesus is the center of Christianity.
[01:28:59.496 --> 01:29:00.817]  It's not Godianity.
[01:29:01.157 --> 01:29:02.118]  It's Christianity.
[01:29:02.758 --> 01:29:03.779]  It's not churchianity.
[01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:07.940]  And so, I always kind of think of the church as my mother.
[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:27.924]  Like my mother taught me how to do everything that I do on a daily basis, from how to comb my hair, brush my teeth, and yet, as a grown-up, I have to respect my mother and love my mother, but also not do everything my mother tells me to do at all times.
[01:29:29.004 --> 01:29:30.705]  I have to make those decisions for myself.
[01:29:31.565 --> 01:29:40.933]  And I think that's what mature people do, is love the people or the institutions that gave them life, but also do what they know is right.
[01:29:40.953 --> 01:29:43.515]  That's a good point.
[01:29:43.715 --> 01:29:43.915]  Yeah.
[01:29:44.716 --> 01:29:45.156]  Hey, Mike.
[01:29:45.456 --> 01:29:45.897]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:29:48.075 --> 01:29:53.921]  I just want to read Luke 8.17 right now because everything is being revealed to us right now.
[01:29:54.101 --> 01:30:02.750]  All the nasty, like, pedal stuff and all the, you know, like, WikiLeaks with pedestrian, like, all the nasty stuff that he's involved with.
[01:30:04.091 --> 01:30:10.878]  For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest, neither anything hid that shall not be known.
[01:30:12.166 --> 01:30:39.953]  To come abroad so God is revealing all the crap that they're doing, you know Washington right now and We we got to stop it somehow, you know, like I don't know if Trump is Like the absolute answer to it, but he's at least you know awoke he started awakening in America and people are starting to realize how how how corrupt and how evil everything is right now in Washington, so
[01:30:40.871 --> 01:30:44.815]  And also, one last thing, I love Brain Force.
[01:30:45.416 --> 01:30:46.097]  That stuff is great.
[01:30:46.657 --> 01:30:49.380]  I always buy like two or three bottles whenever you guys have it on sale.
[01:30:50.602 --> 01:30:51.623]  It's basically like...
[01:30:52.745 --> 01:30:53.506]  Thank you for your time.
[01:31:11.798 --> 01:31:12.878]  It's a brain force plus.
[01:31:13.619 --> 01:31:15.639]  And I don't know if you've ever tried it, but I need to.
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:25.303]  We had a one of one of our frequent guests, Roger Stone, called in last night about I think Alex went to him at about 10 o'clock, 8 o'clock.
[01:31:25.343 --> 01:31:28.184]  He goes, Alex, you know, you didn't tell me to say this.
[01:31:30.137 --> 01:31:32.959]  If I didn't take my brain force right now, I would be passed out.
[01:31:33.659 --> 01:31:35.240]  And he said that's the only thing that kept him going.
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:47.906]  Rogers going up against Supreme Court cases and winning them, they were telling him that his exit polling, people were trying to bring suit against him saying your exit polling is going to be intimidation.
[01:31:48.547 --> 01:31:50.368]  How can it be intimidation if it's an exit poll?
[01:31:51.246 --> 01:31:52.806]  Was his basic argument.
[01:32:09.011 --> 01:32:15.874]  Dozens of these per night to stay awake and there's missions and I'm sure my system is still like affected by that.
[01:32:15.994 --> 01:32:22.157]  So I'm always looking for better ways and more healthy ways to stay awake when I need to and concentrate.
[01:32:22.177 --> 01:32:23.098]  So that sounds like a great.
[01:32:23.318 --> 01:32:25.839]  It's got a lot of, uh, a lot of herbs in it.
[01:32:25.919 --> 01:32:29.361]  It's, it's cold pressed herbs is, is the way to go.
[01:32:29.421 --> 01:32:35.504]  And, and, uh, our main, I guess, advisor, Dr. Group, Edward Group is, is just,
[01:32:36.499 --> 01:32:40.980]  You know, I can go up to him, man, Doc, this and this and this, and he'll go, well, take a look at this.
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:41.620]  Take a look at this.
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:42.841]  I'll go research it myself.
[01:32:42.861 --> 01:32:44.121]  I'm like, oh, maybe that is it.
[01:32:45.041 --> 01:32:45.861]  The guy's a genius.
[01:32:46.462 --> 01:32:48.262]  And it's great that he's on our team.
[01:32:48.822 --> 01:32:50.983]  Let's go to Graham in North Carolina.
[01:32:51.003 --> 01:32:54.884]  Graham, who are you voting for?
[01:32:54.904 --> 01:32:57.484]  Well, I did vote for Trump.
[01:32:57.644 --> 01:32:58.385]  And thanks, Rob.
[01:32:58.445 --> 01:32:59.705]  I appreciate what y'all are doing.
[01:32:59.725 --> 01:33:00.305]  Y'all are great.
[01:33:00.985 --> 01:33:04.086]  And the reason I voted, I'm in North Carolina, the reason I voted for Trump,
[01:33:04.998 --> 01:33:10.162]  It's because I think he represents a real change and we haven't had that kind of an opportunity in quite some time.
[01:33:10.922 --> 01:33:12.283]  I just want to give you a metaphor.
[01:33:13.364 --> 01:33:15.245]  You know, Stone was on the show last week.
[01:33:15.285 --> 01:33:19.608]  He mentioned that it's kind of like the Dutch kid with his finger in the dike.
[01:33:20.168 --> 01:33:28.354]  So do what you will with the devil entendre, but Hillary is like the little Dutch boy holding up the globalist dike, trying to keep everything from collapsing.
[01:33:29.155 --> 01:33:33.638]  And Trump is, I mean, you know, he's a total change.
[01:33:36.121 --> 01:33:42.526]  We're going to see, but will she be able to hold the system together with her finger in the dike?
[01:33:42.566 --> 01:33:43.286]  That's my question.
[01:33:45.148 --> 01:33:45.928]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:33:46.549 --> 01:33:49.751]  If she wins, she comes in with a lot of baggage and a lot of questions.
[01:33:51.292 --> 01:34:02.461]  And, you know, it came out today, they say, I guess a judge said that the Anthony Weiner laptop emails can be made public, but it might take five years before
[01:34:03.263 --> 01:34:04.523]  All the documents are released.
[01:34:04.623 --> 01:34:06.824]  And then, at that point, I think they'll be heavily redacted.
[01:34:08.584 --> 01:34:10.565]  So, I don't know.
[01:34:10.625 --> 01:34:14.146]  There's a set of rules for you and there's a set of rules for Hillary Clinton.
[01:34:14.726 --> 01:34:17.926]  She doesn't seem to have to follow as many rules as the rest of us do.
[01:34:17.946 --> 01:34:22.768]  I mean, they're putting generals in jail right now for doing half, you know, a tenth of what she did.
[01:34:23.928 --> 01:34:25.348]  So, thanks for calling, Graham.
[01:34:26.148 --> 01:34:28.449]  Let's go to John in Florida.
[01:34:29.969 --> 01:34:31.550]  Says, opposition is uncloaking.
[01:34:31.570 --> 01:34:32.470]  Who are you voting for, John?
[01:34:33.504 --> 01:34:35.106]  Already voted for Trump, my man.
[01:34:35.126 --> 01:34:37.009]  Done deal.
[01:34:37.329 --> 01:34:40.494]  Clinton's not doing too well in this informal InfoWars poll.
[01:34:40.654 --> 01:34:42.977]  I kind of had a feeling that would be the case.
[01:34:43.458 --> 01:34:45.060]  So you early voted in Florida.
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:49.026]  Seems like there's a lot more early voter Republicans than in the last election.
[01:34:49.616 --> 01:34:51.817]  Well, I'm also a poll watcher.
[01:34:53.057 --> 01:34:57.738]  Signed up with StopTheSteal.org, the Roger Stone Group.
[01:34:57.958 --> 01:35:09.222]  A little disappointed in all the effort I put in to get the word out to hundreds of thousands of people on social media to get over to StopTheSteal.org and sign up.
[01:35:09.482 --> 01:35:12.043]  And out of all that effort, they only needed about 6,000 people.
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:22.345]  And, uh, as it stands, about 3,300 something, uh, you know, so I've got, I've just got to let everybody know who's listening.
[01:35:22.365 --> 01:35:27.508]  I'm, I'm, I'm kind of disappointed, but I'm very pleased about those who did sign up.
[01:35:27.808 --> 01:35:34.872]  Um, there, there's going to be a supplement of other people who are standing, you know, in the gap outside of Stop the Steal.
[01:35:35.713 --> 01:35:41.416]  But I will tell you that the turnout this morning on the East Coast is phenomenal.
[01:35:42.621 --> 01:35:47.422]  It's, Rob and Reverend Peters, it is phenomenal what's happening.
[01:35:48.222 --> 01:35:51.683]  And, you know, I've thought of many, oh, let me say this real quick.
[01:35:51.703 --> 01:35:52.883]  I don't want to take too much time.
[01:35:53.683 --> 01:36:03.605]  Reverend Peters, I listened very carefully to what you were describing and the catharsis and, you know, that you've gone through and how you continue to do this.
[01:36:03.665 --> 01:36:07.185]  My brother, my youngest brother, he and his wife are both captains.
[01:36:11.298 --> 01:36:11.999]  In the Air Force.
[01:36:12.779 --> 01:36:16.482]  And he, my brother, actually, uh, and this screwed him up.
[01:36:16.603 --> 01:36:19.865]  I mean, he went, he went, uh, I don't know how many tours in, in Iraq.
[01:36:21.026 --> 01:36:25.330]  And, uh, he went in place, actually, of a young man who was supposed to go to Iraq.
[01:36:26.431 --> 01:36:28.833]  And, uh, they hit, uh, some IED.
[01:36:30.014 --> 01:36:34.397]  A lot of the, uh, guys, you know, that were with him got, uh, maimed or killed.
[01:36:35.638 --> 01:36:37.300]  And, uh, so he lives in Montana now.
[01:36:38.878 --> 01:36:49.566]  And he belongs to a group of vets who regularly get together and share things they've written in poetry and things like that.
[01:36:49.586 --> 01:36:53.748]  And so I was listening very keenly to what you had to say.
[01:36:54.569 --> 01:36:55.810]  I'd love to be in touch with him.
[01:36:55.830 --> 01:37:04.596]  And I think one of the things that you brought up in what you just said was this topic, emerging topic of moral injury.
[01:37:04.856 --> 01:37:05.596]  Moral injury is
[01:37:07.653 --> 01:37:22.907]  If PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, is about being the prey, that something's hunting you, something's out to get you, and we all have a fear reaction to that, and sometimes we have a fear reaction when nothing's hunting us, and that's why it's a disorder, because it's at a disordered time.
[01:37:24.048 --> 01:37:25.810]  Moral injury is about being the predator.
[01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:29.493]  It's about hunting people or standing by when
[01:37:30.908 --> 01:37:32.229]  We normally would help people.
[01:37:32.269 --> 01:37:34.910]  You know, we all were raised... Allowing yourself to be a predator, essentially.
[01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:38.032]  Yeah, and that's what the military trains us to do, rightfully so.
[01:37:38.072 --> 01:37:43.836]  You've got to learn how to... The first thing I learned in the Marine Corps as an enlisted Marine was to stab with a bayonet.
[01:37:43.896 --> 01:37:50.640]  I mean, that's a pretty basic, primal form of fighting that we rarely do, but you have to be ready for that.
[01:37:51.468 --> 01:37:58.454]  And so how to injure and hurt other people is the first step of military training, and it's rightfully so.
[01:37:58.474 --> 01:38:12.486]  And yet we're raised in a culture where we're not supposed to hit our brother, don't hit your sister, be nice, be gentle, and we all have a moral code, and yet the world of war is an upside-down moral universe where
[01:38:13.086 --> 01:38:13.747]  Good is bad.
[01:38:13.787 --> 01:38:14.347]  Bad is good.
[01:38:14.387 --> 01:38:15.308]  Weakness is bad.
[01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:16.249]  Strength is good.
[01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:17.491]  Cruelty is good.
[01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:25.239]  All these things that the moral compasses of our society say, don't do that here, do it over there.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:33.648]  So, soldiers, veterans, airmen, Marines come back with sailors with a... Time to flip that switch, too.
[01:38:33.668 --> 01:38:33.789]  Yeah.
[01:38:34.502 --> 01:38:36.303]  You know, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[01:38:36.943 --> 01:38:42.085]  Now, go back to the 7-Eleven at your corner and if some guy bumps into you, chill out.
[01:38:42.505 --> 01:38:44.966]  You know, it's hard to turn that off.
[01:38:45.046 --> 01:38:51.689]  And once you've been ingrained in that, you know, that's what Biggs has said.
[01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:56.250]  It was hard for him to come back and just integrate back into society.
[01:38:56.730 --> 01:39:02.653]  And you know, a lot of guys out there, they turn to substance abuse, I guess is one of the first things, probably one of the biggest things that people
[01:39:03.433 --> 01:39:07.417]  Succumb to, come back to try and numb, I guess, those feelings that they're having.
[01:39:07.637 --> 01:39:09.959]  Yeah, I certainly did that when I came back.
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:14.824]  And I lived in a community where that was the acceptable norm.
[01:39:15.784 --> 01:39:18.187]  And so climbing out of that's not easy.
[01:39:18.947 --> 01:39:22.651]  There's a feeling of, I'm not good anymore because I did these things.
[01:39:22.691 --> 01:39:23.111]  I'm not good.
[01:39:23.151 --> 01:39:25.634]  Or I stood by while other people suffered and I didn't help them.
[01:39:26.394 --> 01:39:28.596]  Because war gives you opportunities to
[01:39:29.577 --> 01:39:39.525]  It puts you in a situation where the only choice is usually a really difficult one that's morally repugnant to ourselves and the things we were taught as children.
[01:39:39.545 --> 01:39:41.226]  So we come back and say, I'm not good anymore.
[01:39:41.706 --> 01:39:42.347]  What do I do?
[01:39:42.367 --> 01:39:47.330]  And that's where, Michael, the church is a moral institution.
[01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:50.273]  We're supposed to represent morality on some level.
[01:39:50.773 --> 01:39:53.095]  And so the church has the power to bring people back.
[01:39:53.175 --> 01:39:58.318]  And things like poetry, what the caller described, his brother-in-law doing, brother doing.
[01:39:59.139 --> 01:39:59.499]  I don't know.
[01:40:20.404 --> 01:40:29.069]  You know, one thing about mutuality and conversation, that if I'm going to tell you what I think and you should do, then I should be willing to listen to what you think.
[01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:31.210]  I might have something to learn from you as well.
[01:40:31.230 --> 01:40:31.831]  Yeah.
[01:40:32.411 --> 01:40:34.092]  I've heard you say that before, actually.
[01:40:36.574 --> 01:40:41.256]  You know, when I do interviews, I usually have like one or two things I want to ask, and then I see where it takes me from there.
[01:40:41.596 --> 01:40:44.498]  And you have to listen in order to get to that spot.
[01:40:45.059 --> 01:40:48.741]  Going out and interviewing people at these Trump rallies, you know, I have no idea what they're going to say.
[01:40:49.341 --> 01:40:50.483]  Some of them take me on a path.
[01:40:50.983 --> 01:40:55.088]  You know, one guy started talking about he's owning a vape shop and now he's under all these regulations.
[01:40:55.829 --> 01:40:59.053]  And it was a successful small business, but now he's worried.
[01:41:00.151 --> 01:41:05.317]  The inroads he was making into being successful are now being taken away by, you know, the different regulations they have.
[01:41:05.677 --> 01:41:18.010]  Guys, if y'all can look up out there on one of the networks, if anybody's gotten any long lines showing, we could start showing those to see how many people are voting on the East Coast.
[01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:19.893]  Got John in Florida who's poll watching.
[01:41:19.933 --> 01:41:21.034]  What part of Florida are you in, John?
[01:41:23.786 --> 01:41:24.607]  Yeah, hey, you there?
[01:41:24.947 --> 01:41:27.469]  What part of Florida are you in right now?
[01:41:27.729 --> 01:41:28.169]  Miami.
[01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:29.530]  Miami, okay.
[01:41:29.991 --> 01:41:34.774]  Yeah, they're saying the Cuban population is turning Trump.
[01:41:35.195 --> 01:41:36.756]  Is that what you've seen being in Miami?
[01:41:37.476 --> 01:41:43.421]  Yeah, well, you know, the thing is I am of Hispanic descent, so I would notice things like that.
[01:41:46.203 --> 01:41:51.407]  I think we're going to witness, we are witnessing a phenomena here.
[01:41:52.319 --> 01:41:59.066]  And, you know, there's other people that are exit pollers I'm talking to up and down the East Coast, clear up into New Hampshire and into New York.
[01:41:59.973 --> 01:42:15.844]  And they're witnessing, and I'm watching social media, and there are people who are reporting that, you know, they're getting out of bed at six o'clock, five o'clock, and the enthusiasm and the motivation is just off the charts.
[01:42:17.405 --> 01:42:21.227]  So before I go, I just want to just kind of sum something up real quick, if I could, Rob.
[01:42:21.247 --> 01:42:21.628]  Go ahead.
[01:42:22.589 --> 01:42:25.270]  Because the whole point of the call is about this uncloaking.
[01:42:26.170 --> 01:42:45.698]  And, you know, I believe that, you know, being a Christian myself, that sometimes we have to step outside of this things we see and think and feel just with our natural, you know, five senses, and step into the realm of understanding that we are in a book of revelations.
[01:42:46.731 --> 01:42:53.834]  Um, uh, scenario here where it truly, like the earlier caller said, it is, it is down to good versus evil.
[01:42:53.874 --> 01:42:55.315]  There's just no question about it.
[01:42:55.495 --> 01:43:08.741]  And the, the enemy is on cloaking, but at the same time, there is this, this, uh, spotlighting this bringing to light these dirty deeds through WikiLeaks and things that have been hidden from us for so long.
[01:43:08.781 --> 01:43:10.481]  And they're, they're completely exposed.
[01:43:10.521 --> 01:43:11.762]  So on one side of the coin,
[01:43:12.462 --> 01:43:29.338]  When it comes to people like James Comey, the FBI, our law enforcement, the Department of Justice, what we should have witnessed was this unapologetic investigation and prosecutorial aggression of what I'm going to call the scum.
[01:43:29.998 --> 01:43:31.600]  That, you know, we're not seeing.
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:51.600]  But at the same time, this balancing out and this awakening and awareness that is just flooding, you know, on the internet on a daily basis and through InfoWars, you know, and social media, just the sharing.
[01:43:52.572 --> 01:43:54.934]  There's no return from this.
[01:43:54.954 --> 01:44:04.601]  If everything were to stop today, the United States of America and the planet, but the United States of America will never be the same again.
[01:44:05.421 --> 01:44:18.370]  Especially with what we know about the mainstream media, the new media advancement, the total misconduct of individuals who are oath-sworn individuals who hold public office and review or are
[01:44:20.157 --> 01:44:25.178]  Perceive their oath as a ceremonial procedure with their fingers crossed behind their back.
[01:44:25.198 --> 01:44:27.399]  We are the ones who are going to make the difference today.
[01:44:27.839 --> 01:44:28.599]  I'll leave it there.
[01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:31.540]  Reverend Peters, I'm going to look you up on the internet.
[01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:34.181]  We'll see if we can make a connection with my brother, Rob.
[01:44:34.621 --> 01:44:35.401]  Thank you.
[01:44:35.501 --> 01:44:36.402]  Keep your eyes open.
[01:44:36.822 --> 01:44:37.442]  We'll talk later.
[01:44:37.702 --> 01:44:38.322]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:44:38.702 --> 01:44:42.583]  And hit us up on Twitter if you see anything out of the ordinary.
[01:44:42.883 --> 01:44:43.824]  We'd be glad to report it.
[01:44:44.364 --> 01:44:45.504]  And your Twitter is what?
[01:44:45.624 --> 01:44:46.805]  At DVD Peters?
[01:44:46.825 --> 01:44:47.765]  Yep, DVD Peters.
[01:44:48.385 --> 01:44:54.329]  Yeah, add DVD Peters, see if y'all can bring that up, and that's a good way to get in touch with David Peters.
[01:44:54.689 --> 01:44:56.250]  Here's an article from the Seattle Times.
[01:44:56.410 --> 01:44:59.713]  Shift among Cuban-American voters could deliver Florida to Trump.
[01:45:01.074 --> 01:45:06.978]  And, you know, if anybody knows totalitarian dictatorships, it's the people of Cuba.
[01:45:08.038 --> 01:45:14.483]  And they've been... There's not too many people that I think are around before... There's probably still a few.
[01:45:15.396 --> 01:45:32.695]  around before Castro took over but Cuba used to be the place where they would send the new style of dishwasher to have people check it out to work out any bugs so they would they would get all this new stuff before anybody else in the United States and because it was just you know a quick boat ride down there and
[01:45:35.417 --> 01:45:41.222]  I had a friend who traveled there and he said the old cars are amazing in the way they've kept them running.
[01:45:41.802 --> 01:45:45.746]  They've had to develop ways and means to keep these because there's no parts coming in.
[01:45:45.766 --> 01:45:47.467]  You can't just get a spark plug.
[01:45:47.827 --> 01:45:49.208]  Better learn how to fix that spark plug.
[01:45:49.709 --> 01:45:50.790]  Rebuild the spark plug.
[01:45:51.250 --> 01:46:00.898]  Find the parts to make it happen and you know resilient people down there in Cuba and I think it's a really good thing that we've
[01:46:02.355 --> 01:46:18.208]  Not that we're working necessarily with the communist government down there, but that we're opening up relations to allow people to go in there and people to come out of there and change that because they are, the Cuban people are good people and great, fantastic musicians.
[01:46:19.088 --> 01:46:19.709]  Fantastic.
[01:46:20.209 --> 01:46:23.452]  Do you have any comments on what John said there at the end?
[01:46:26.059 --> 01:46:29.762]  I think that we are in a spiritual war all the time.
[01:46:29.782 --> 01:46:34.746]  And that's certainly how I read the book of Revelation that was shared.
[01:46:34.826 --> 01:46:37.569]  It's the book, the title in Greek is Apocalypse.
[01:46:38.049 --> 01:46:41.812]  That's in the Greek, that's the Greek word for revealing or revelation.
[01:46:43.934 --> 01:46:50.579]  It certainly describes a cosmic struggle that's probably behind everything that's happening in our world that we observe.
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:55.103]  And yet Christians throughout the centuries have disagreed on what those things were.
[01:46:55.603 --> 01:47:04.890]  If you read time around the Reformation, you'll see obvious characters are characters in their timeline.
[01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:06.271]  We read it in ours as well.
[01:47:07.933 --> 01:47:09.614]  And yet there's certainly something that's
[01:47:11.075 --> 01:47:16.280]  There's something in Revelation about witness, that we witness to the truth wherever we find it.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:21.264]  And the real heroes in the book of Revelation are the martyrs who suffer for their faith.
[01:47:21.284 --> 01:47:22.665]  And that's happening around the world.
[01:47:23.226 --> 01:47:28.130]  There's Christians around the world that are suffering for their faith, that are being killed in horrible ways.
[01:47:28.730 --> 01:47:36.817]  And I know that's one thing I try to stay tuned into the Anglican Communion and other news services that cover world Christianity because
[01:47:37.438 --> 01:47:40.299]  I mean, the church is an international thing.
[01:47:40.359 --> 01:47:42.220]  It's not just an American thing.
[01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:46.141]  And it's easy for me as an American to say, well, I'm concerned about America.
[01:47:46.221 --> 01:47:50.162]  But we live in a world that's pretty connected, especially in the church world.
[01:47:50.982 --> 01:47:55.464]  And so when Christians are persecuted, it affects all of us.
[01:47:55.764 --> 01:47:59.285]  And I think that happened in Cuba for a long time.
[01:47:59.565 --> 01:48:05.247]  So to see that opening up, I think that'll lead to less persecution for people like that.
[01:48:06.257 --> 01:48:09.580]  What do you say to people who go, well, I'm not going to do anything, it's in God's hands.
[01:48:10.981 --> 01:48:12.102]  You know, I'm just going to sit back.
[01:48:12.702 --> 01:48:13.683]  Revelations is coming.
[01:48:13.703 --> 01:48:14.084]  It's here.
[01:48:14.604 --> 01:48:15.385]  This is the sign.
[01:48:15.645 --> 01:48:16.926]  I've got the three signs already.
[01:48:16.966 --> 01:48:17.887]  There's another one coming.
[01:48:18.808 --> 01:48:21.710]  Yeah, why rearrange the deck chairs in the Titanic?
[01:48:21.730 --> 01:48:22.951]  Yeah, it's all going to happen anyway.
[01:48:23.031 --> 01:48:24.032]  The ship's sinking.
[01:48:25.213 --> 01:48:26.054]  Why bother?
[01:48:26.474 --> 01:48:32.395]  And I think that's not, that's certainly not what Jesus did when he was on this earth.
[01:48:33.075 --> 01:48:38.196]  He spoke out against the powerful, and he loved the people that were at the bottom.
[01:48:38.216 --> 01:48:45.318]  I mean, how else could 5,000 men come out to hear him give the Sermon on the Mount, or the feeding of the 5,000?
[01:48:45.958 --> 01:48:48.079]  5,000 men are reported to have been there.
[01:48:48.419 --> 01:48:48.799]  Where would 5,000 men
[01:48:50.439 --> 01:48:50.599]  I don't
[01:49:09.608 --> 01:49:10.629]  Bringing people together.
[01:49:11.269 --> 01:49:17.875]  When he had opportunities for insurrection, an armed insurrection, he turned them down because he had a mission.
[01:49:18.255 --> 01:49:20.077]  I think Christians are followers of Jesus.
[01:49:20.657 --> 01:49:25.201]  We have lived under every single government system that's ever existed on this planet.
[01:49:25.842 --> 01:49:28.704]  There were no democracies when Christianity was born.
[01:49:28.744 --> 01:49:34.108]  It was a Roman imperial system with client kings that were paid to do the job.
[01:49:35.069 --> 01:49:40.570]  And then we had, we were under the Charlemagne, the Visigoths, the Ostrogoths, Genghis Khan.
[01:49:41.371 --> 01:49:43.131]  We've existed in every form of government.
[01:49:44.311 --> 01:49:46.372]  And we change in that.
[01:49:46.672 --> 01:49:52.513]  I think right now we kind of see our church institutions as democratic institutions.
[01:49:53.134 --> 01:49:54.214]  It certainly has an effect.
[01:49:55.494 --> 01:50:04.161]  In the Episcopal Church, the way we govern is a bicameral system, a two-house system, and it's very reflective of our government.
[01:50:04.181 --> 01:50:12.166]  And yet, I think it's always good to remember that Christianity is a much older institution than democracy.
[01:50:12.186 --> 01:50:13.127]  It is.
[01:50:13.207 --> 01:50:21.273]  In fact, when I was in Rome last summer, we got a tour of some of the underground catacombs and they showed some
[01:50:22.762 --> 01:50:26.185]  What they said they think is the first depiction of Jesus Christ ever.
[01:50:26.946 --> 01:50:28.467]  On a wall, right there.
[01:50:30.169 --> 01:50:30.629]  Amazing.
[01:50:30.689 --> 01:50:32.290]  And these were underground churches.
[01:50:32.370 --> 01:50:36.214]  We were about 60 feet underground and maybe even more.
[01:50:37.335 --> 01:50:40.878]  But what they had to go through to express their faith
[01:50:42.608 --> 01:50:46.090]  You know, it wasn't Sunday morning service outside in the trees.
[01:50:46.150 --> 01:50:51.692]  It was underground, be quiet, we're going to practice our faith, and if we're caught, we're dead.
[01:50:52.573 --> 01:50:56.735]  Yeah, to say Jesus is Lord in the first century was a political statement.
[01:50:57.155 --> 01:50:57.355]  Yeah.
[01:50:57.375 --> 01:50:59.316]  You were saying Caesar wasn't.
[01:50:59.476 --> 01:51:00.076]  Caesar wasn't.
[01:51:01.317 --> 01:51:01.457]  Yes.
[01:51:16.834 --> 01:51:19.595]  I have a couple stories about Roman officers.
[01:51:19.815 --> 01:51:20.915]  One of them is St.
[01:51:20.975 --> 01:51:21.835]  Martin of Tours.
[01:51:22.475 --> 01:51:24.576]  His feast day is November 11th.
[01:51:24.716 --> 01:51:25.636]  It's Veterans Day.
[01:51:26.136 --> 01:51:27.416]  He's a patron saint of veterans.
[01:51:27.556 --> 01:51:31.617]  He was a Roman soldier who was coming into a city in France.
[01:51:31.677 --> 01:51:32.457]  It was very cold.
[01:51:32.517 --> 01:51:36.778]  A beggar was half naked or maybe naked out there in the gate begging.
[01:51:37.198 --> 01:51:40.959]  He took his Roman army cloak and cut it in half, gave half to the beggar.
[01:51:40.979 --> 01:51:45.060]  That night, Jesus appeared to him and said, you know, you need to go all the way.
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:46.140]  I'm not sure.
[01:52:01.269 --> 01:52:02.591]  Cause of transformation in his life.
[01:52:02.791 --> 01:52:06.036]  And he, you know, he eventually becomes a peacemaker.
[01:52:07.158 --> 01:52:09.741]  So much so that he has his own moral injury.
[01:52:09.822 --> 01:52:11.123]  Read early accounts of his life.
[01:52:11.163 --> 01:52:17.172]  He won't even come near the altar of the church because he feels so bad about what he's done as a soldier.
[01:52:17.933 --> 01:52:19.395]  And yet God brings him back.
[01:52:19.435 --> 01:52:21.157]  He becomes a real life-giving person.
[01:52:21.177 --> 01:52:30.486]  And he's a patron of veterans, because I think veterans do have that story of, you know, we've benefited in some way and been powerful in war.
[01:52:31.067 --> 01:52:32.688]  And now we need to be powerful in peace.
[01:52:32.749 --> 01:52:34.470]  We need to be powerful in reconciliation.
[01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:36.251]  And we have that ability.
[01:52:36.571 --> 01:52:36.772]  Yeah.
[01:52:37.132 --> 01:52:47.703]  As a nation, we have that ability to be powerful in peace and to spread the ideals that create, you know, more freedom and more opportunity and more spirituality.
[01:52:47.863 --> 01:52:48.104]  Yeah.
[01:52:48.304 --> 01:52:54.871]  And in the end, like people aren't struggling, they could be more spiritual and then fulfill God's mission.
[01:52:55.291 --> 01:52:56.592]  You've got two books, a death letter
[01:52:57.318 --> 01:53:02.119]  God, sex, and war, and post-traumatic God, how the church cares for people who have been to hell and back.
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:03.860]  This is your newest book.
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:10.122]  Death Letter's being made into a movie, and both of them, they can be picked up on Amazon.
[01:53:10.162 --> 01:53:11.902]  Go a little bit into post-traumatic God.
[01:53:12.422 --> 01:53:13.343]  Why did you decide to write that?
[01:53:14.203 --> 01:53:15.723]  It's really a sequel to the first book.
[01:53:15.743 --> 01:53:19.444]  The first book's about the crash and how I went down to the darkness.
[01:53:19.764 --> 01:53:21.425]  The second book is kind of how I came out of that.
[01:53:22.512 --> 01:53:28.718]  And it was through the power of a community and the church, and I kind of parallel a couple different biographies.
[01:53:28.818 --> 01:53:30.339]  One is Paul Tillich, I mentioned him earlier.
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:32.441]  He was a World War I army chaplain.
[01:53:32.461 --> 01:53:37.866]  He was in three of the four major battles as a German army chaplain on the losing side.
[01:53:38.367 --> 01:53:41.029]  He is hospitalized about three times during the war.
[01:53:41.049 --> 01:53:43.892]  He buries hundreds and hundreds of his own people.
[01:53:44.892 --> 01:53:45.873]  Including his best friend.
[01:53:45.913 --> 01:53:46.533]  He comes back.
[01:53:46.593 --> 01:53:49.094]  His wife is pregnant with another guy's baby.
[01:53:49.634 --> 01:53:50.814]  He goes through a divorce.
[01:53:51.194 --> 01:53:57.316]  He goes through this time of great chaos and uncertainty and then emerges to become a professor.
[01:53:57.597 --> 01:54:02.598]  He's the first professor kicked out by Hitler and his regime in 1933.
[01:54:02.638 --> 01:54:09.601]  He comes to America and becomes like the dominant or most popular theologian of the 20th century in America.
[01:54:10.461 --> 01:54:22.127]  He teaches all over the place, Harvard, University of Chicago, Union Seminary, New York, and yet his theology is really kind of weird for America and for Christians.
[01:54:22.828 --> 01:54:23.708]  It's real different.
[01:54:24.148 --> 01:54:33.514]  And I'm arguing that his theology is a post-traumatic theology based on his experiences in World War I, because I experienced that.
[01:54:33.674 --> 01:54:39.077]  I felt like the God I believed in died in Iraq, but somehow this good, benevolent,
[01:54:39.957 --> 01:54:40.978]  And you were a chaplain?
[01:55:00.532 --> 01:55:02.253]  And so I found this emptiness in my life.
[01:55:02.273 --> 01:55:04.935]  I had to figure out a way to reconnect with God.
[01:55:05.195 --> 01:55:13.381]  I did that through Paul Tillich's theology at first, and then through a different journey into a spiritual practice that I found in the church I'm in now.
[01:55:13.441 --> 01:55:16.423]  But I found that to be true in a lot of veterans' lives.
[01:55:17.463 --> 01:55:18.744]  And people have been through trauma.
[01:55:19.725 --> 01:55:27.711]  Anything that flips your world upside down has real potential for amazing growth if we're patient enough to do it.
[01:55:27.751 --> 01:55:29.432]  That which does not kill you makes you stronger.
[01:55:29.752 --> 01:55:30.293]  Exactly.
[01:55:30.473 --> 01:55:36.017]  But that point between the not killing you and making you stronger is a really difficult time.
[01:55:36.177 --> 01:55:36.878]  The makes part.
[01:55:38.078 --> 01:55:44.001]  Makes us several years of work and understanding and listening and talking and writing.
[01:55:44.402 --> 01:55:48.424]  You've also done drum circles for veterans, getting them together.
[01:55:50.465 --> 01:55:54.367]  Beating on a drum and finding a rhythm can do a lot to help a person.
[01:55:54.787 --> 01:56:07.992]  Yeah, I mean, I've gone to the VA, I've, you know, the medication, the counseling, it's good, but we need to go another step further, and that's, like, things like guitar groups, drum circles, spirituality groups, poetry readings.
[01:56:08.853 --> 01:56:12.214]  These are ways to get at the heart, because the heart is the thing that's wounded.
[01:56:12.254 --> 01:56:15.916]  Everybody loses something in a war, we're just not always sure what we're going to lose.
[01:56:16.276 --> 01:56:18.137]  I think as our nation, we've lost a lot in war.
[01:56:18.177 --> 01:56:23.419]  Even the wars we consider the good ones, like World War II, I think we lost a lot in that war.
[01:56:24.059 --> 01:56:26.941]  And I think my grandfather was... I dedicate this book to him.
[01:56:26.961 --> 01:56:34.044]  He was a World War II veteran that really struggled after the war and died before I was born.
[01:56:34.784 --> 01:56:35.865]  He died way too soon.
[01:56:37.346 --> 01:56:39.167]  And I never got to know him.
[01:56:39.707 --> 01:56:43.309]  But I know he was profoundly affected by that war.
[01:56:44.301 --> 01:56:46.463]  My grandfather was in the war on my mom's side.
[01:56:46.503 --> 01:56:51.809]  He wanted to be a belly gunner in a B-52 and they made him a clerk in England.
[01:56:51.849 --> 01:56:59.618]  So the farthest he got was into England and the closest he ever got to combat was he had just left a building and a buzz bomb dropped, hit the building five minutes after he left.
[01:56:59.818 --> 01:57:00.038]  Wow.
[01:57:00.519 --> 01:57:01.600]  You know, and destroyed the building.
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:05.482]  And that's a big topic with moral injury, because moral injury is that I didn't do enough.
[01:57:06.062 --> 01:57:07.583]  And I have that feeling as a chaplain.
[01:57:07.603 --> 01:57:08.583]  I didn't do enough.
[01:57:08.603 --> 01:57:09.924]  I could have done more.
[01:57:09.944 --> 01:57:11.444]  I could have gone on more missions.
[01:57:11.504 --> 01:57:12.585]  I should have.
[01:57:12.605 --> 01:57:12.985]  I would have.
[01:57:13.565 --> 01:57:17.307]  And that, you know, as Alfred Adler used to say, you're shooting all over yourself.
[01:57:17.347 --> 01:57:18.488]  Stop shooting on yourself.
[01:57:19.188 --> 01:57:27.732]  That feeling of shame, and I could have done more, is so paralyzing that it's like, now I can't do anything, so I'll just sit here and drink myself to death.
[01:57:27.912 --> 01:57:29.593]  Or whatever that self-destruction is.
[01:57:30.213 --> 01:57:35.556]  And we're trying to create a community where we say, what can we do to make the world a better place?
[01:57:36.116 --> 01:57:39.838]  Our veterans and our groups are doing amazing things to connect people.
[01:57:40.858 --> 01:57:42.439]  And we're all over the political spectrum.
[01:57:42.459 --> 01:57:47.702]  That's the beauty of veterans' work, is that it goes across all the political boundaries.
[01:57:47.782 --> 01:57:49.223]  It's a human issue.
[01:57:50.183 --> 01:57:53.565]  And I found that to be great for the church, because I'm part of the Episcopal Church.
[01:57:53.605 --> 01:58:01.170]  We're a pretty progressive church that is generally on that side of the political spectrum on a national scale.
[01:58:01.930 --> 01:58:09.795]  And the thing about veterans' ministry and work is that it's right down the middle of every human life, because I think that's what really is the wound.
[01:58:10.015 --> 01:58:14.638]  A lot of people either know a veteran, are a veteran, or mom or dad was a veteran.
[01:58:14.878 --> 01:58:18.160]  There's a lot of people out there, you know,
[01:58:19.249 --> 01:58:31.681]  My wife, her dad went to Vietnam and it's just... war is... I don't know, what are your thoughts on, what's your final thought on war?
[01:58:32.461 --> 01:58:33.202]  I think war is a...
[01:58:35.024 --> 01:58:47.854]  That's why I wrote a book about God, sex, and war, because I think sex and war are both areas of human life that are kind of always with us and also really difficult to get right all the time.
[01:58:49.355 --> 01:59:00.464]  Our violence somehow is in every story of human existence all the way back to Cain and Abel, the first, you know, in that mythology of Genesis you have this
[01:59:01.604 --> 01:59:02.705]  Brother killing a brother.
[01:59:02.725 --> 01:59:03.785]  And that's what war is.
[01:59:03.805 --> 01:59:05.246]  It's brothers killing brothers.
[01:59:06.006 --> 01:59:16.411]  And it's somehow part of our human existence, which is why Jesus died on a cross, crucified by soldiers.
[01:59:16.851 --> 01:59:18.652]  I think that's a really profound statement.
[01:59:18.672 --> 01:59:23.814]  And the first person to recognize that he's the Son of God is a Roman centurion that crucified him.
[01:59:24.494 --> 01:59:28.217]  So, this unmasking of violence is, I think, the message of Jesus.
[01:59:28.257 --> 01:59:34.482]  That violence is not powerful, even though it seems to be the most powerful force in the world.
[01:59:34.863 --> 01:59:35.383]  It's not.
[01:59:36.084 --> 01:59:37.525]  The most powerful force is love.
[01:59:38.166 --> 01:59:41.829]  And it always transforms violence into something that...
[01:59:43.590 --> 01:59:44.892]  It's something that's very weak.
[01:59:45.292 --> 01:59:48.015]  So I think that war is always with us.
[01:59:48.756 --> 01:59:53.482]  We're always going to hear rumors of it, as Jesus says in the reading for next Sunday.
[01:59:53.502 --> 01:59:55.705]  You're going to hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[01:59:57.127 --> 01:59:58.668]  And don't believe it all.
[01:59:59.741 --> 02:00:02.903]  He says, you know, be wise about these things.
[02:00:03.643 --> 02:00:07.325]  Because I found I was very excited about being part of a war.
[02:00:07.345 --> 02:00:09.226]  I was really thrilled about it.
[02:00:09.246 --> 02:00:09.946]  I'd served in the rear.
[02:00:09.966 --> 02:00:10.886]  Because they attacked us.
[02:00:11.347 --> 02:00:11.667]  Yeah.
[02:00:11.687 --> 02:00:12.787]  We had to go defend ourselves.
[02:00:13.408 --> 02:00:14.628]  We had to do something.
[02:00:15.609 --> 02:00:17.590]  And I was excited about that.
[02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:19.971]  I was finally going to get my chance to be a man.
[02:00:20.611 --> 02:00:21.612]  Prove my manhood.
[02:00:22.232 --> 02:00:24.073]  And so there's something in us that needs that.
[02:00:25.013 --> 02:00:25.914]  Something in me at least.
[02:00:26.912 --> 02:00:29.593]  And I found that that wasn't the way to become a man.
[02:00:29.613 --> 02:00:36.374]  In fact, in some ways, my participation in war made me weaker as a man.
[02:00:36.394 --> 02:00:42.695]  And I think real strength comes from people that make peace and bring reconciliation.
[02:00:43.175 --> 02:00:49.677]  It's a lot harder road to do that, to offer an open hand instead of a closed fist, as they say.
[02:00:49.697 --> 02:00:50.717]  Yeah, it takes a lot of courage.
[02:00:51.357 --> 02:00:53.700]  Well, he's coming out of it now, post-traumatic.
[02:00:55.363 --> 02:00:57.125]  It's the post-traumatic stress of going to war.
[02:00:57.686 --> 02:01:00.109]  He's got two books, Death Letter and Post-Traumatic God.
[02:01:00.129 --> 02:01:01.912]  You can check him out on Amazon.com.
[02:01:01.932 --> 02:01:06.899]  You can follow him on Twitter at DvdPeters, right there.
[02:01:08.756 --> 02:01:10.318]  Uh, very interesting life.
[02:01:10.538 --> 02:01:13.161]  You've even recently survived a little bike accident, right?
[02:01:13.302 --> 02:01:15.084]  Yeah, had a tumble on the bike.
[02:01:15.924 --> 02:01:18.407]  Hit by a pickup truck.
[02:01:18.487 --> 02:01:19.889]  That's not surprising in Texas.
[02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:21.130]  Thankful to be alive.
[02:01:22.031 --> 02:01:24.975]  And to me, biking is kind of like, it's like life.
[02:01:25.135 --> 02:01:26.496]  I kind of need to do it.
[02:01:28.558 --> 02:01:39.585]  After riding in all those vehicles in Iraq, just heavy vehicles that were just armored, and there was a real distance between me and the Iraqi people and other people, and for good reasons.
[02:01:39.645 --> 02:01:40.526]  It was really dangerous.
[02:01:41.366 --> 02:01:49.531]  To me, a bicycle kind of just lets me be a human being in a way that I can't be in a four-wheeled car or cage, if you will.
[02:01:50.532 --> 02:01:51.412]  So it was a big blow.
[02:01:51.472 --> 02:01:55.135]  The bike's getting fixed, I'm getting fixed, and I'll be back on the road soon.
[02:01:55.715 --> 02:01:58.096]  I personally ride on the sidewalks as much as possible.
[02:01:58.117 --> 02:01:58.377]  Yeah.
[02:01:58.697 --> 02:01:59.657]  It's really dangerous.
[02:01:59.717 --> 02:02:00.938]  Yeah.
[02:02:01.238 --> 02:02:02.259]  It definitely is.
[02:02:02.319 --> 02:02:04.540]  And I always get mad at the bikers that ride in the middle of the road.
[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:05.281]  Exactly.
[02:02:05.301 --> 02:02:06.682]  I'm like, why are you doing this?
[02:02:06.942 --> 02:02:07.422]  I do too.
[02:02:07.442 --> 02:02:10.104]  When I'm driving a car, those guys, like, what are they doing?
[02:02:10.124 --> 02:02:10.984]  And then I'm in a bike.
[02:02:11.204 --> 02:02:13.065]  It's like, what are these cars doing?
[02:02:13.085 --> 02:02:13.886]  They're trying to kill me.
[02:02:13.906 --> 02:02:14.346]  Yeah.
[02:02:14.466 --> 02:02:17.888]  So I think that's, that may be a good political commentary too.
[02:02:17.908 --> 02:02:22.451]  We often see the group that we're not in as, um, as the bad group.
[02:02:22.751 --> 02:02:23.151]  Yeah.
[02:02:23.291 --> 02:02:24.712]  The group stopping progress.
[02:02:24.832 --> 02:02:29.053]  Well, not just bad or good, because I think that's true, but really subhuman.
[02:02:29.493 --> 02:02:33.954]  Whenever we subhumanize someone, I think that's how wars start.
[02:02:34.014 --> 02:02:36.715]  We say that that group is subhuman.
[02:02:37.215 --> 02:02:41.997]  And so they need to be killed, every last one of them, men, women, children.
[02:02:42.017 --> 02:02:45.138]  And we have to dehumanize people to do that.
[02:02:45.638 --> 02:02:51.422]  I think what every soldier and marine and warrior feels when they are in a war is that the enemy is human.
[02:02:52.062 --> 02:02:56.165]  In fact, if you don't respect their humanity, they're going to kill you real fast.
[02:02:56.485 --> 02:02:59.647]  If you don't respect their intelligence, they're going to kill you real fast.
[02:03:00.208 --> 02:03:03.030]  So, there's a prayer in this prayer book for our enemies.
[02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:06.732]  I mean, Jesus did say, pray for your enemies, love your enemies.
[02:03:07.933 --> 02:03:09.574]  And that's really hard to do for veterans.
[02:03:10.014 --> 02:03:15.198]  We do, it's some in our church, and we try to work towards that, but that's a long healing process.
[02:03:16.158 --> 02:03:17.739]  And I'm on that process myself.
[02:03:17.759 --> 02:03:25.282]  Because veterans are the one group in our culture that has had literal enemies that were trying to kill them.
[02:03:25.542 --> 02:03:26.142]  Yeah.
[02:03:26.262 --> 02:03:27.383]  And how to reconcile there.
[02:03:28.103 --> 02:03:31.265]  I look to the Vietnam generation as an example of how to do that.
[02:03:32.225 --> 02:03:35.046]  And other wars as well, including the Gulf War and others.
[02:03:35.907 --> 02:03:41.309]  Do you think it's possible for, and I'll end it with this question, I think this is pretty heavy too, do you think it's possible for
[02:03:42.481 --> 02:03:54.706]  Islam and Christianity to coexist in a world that we're at now when we see what's going on in the Middle East with this real radical form of Islam attacking Christians, killing Christians, driving Christians out.
[02:03:55.847 --> 02:03:56.647]  Do you think it's possible?
[02:03:59.569 --> 02:04:00.409]  I think that
[02:04:02.153 --> 02:04:05.754]  It is one historical issue.
[02:04:05.774 --> 02:04:09.175]  I would say my short answer is yes.
[02:04:09.896 --> 02:04:12.136]  All coexistence is possible.
[02:04:12.156 --> 02:04:13.317]  All peace is possible.
[02:04:13.357 --> 02:04:18.098]  We have to, on some level, believe that if we're ever going to do anything good in this world.
[02:04:18.818 --> 02:04:21.119]  We have to have some hope.
[02:04:21.359 --> 02:04:22.620]  Hope is not optimism.
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:24.820]  I'm kind of a pessimistic person.
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:26.321]  I kind of think things are all good.
[02:04:26.721 --> 02:04:27.121]  I think.
[02:04:43.098 --> 02:04:50.664]  God created us, the story of Genesis, the story of creation, the story of conflict, the story of restoration, that's all throughout the scriptures.
[02:04:51.705 --> 02:04:53.706]  There is this thread of hope through it all.
[02:04:54.167 --> 02:05:01.012]  Even though we live in a Good Friday world, a world where good is crucified, there's Easter coming.
[02:05:01.573 --> 02:05:02.674]  And so I have this hope.
[02:05:03.634 --> 02:05:15.283]  For my Muslim brothers, and I've known many really wonderful Muslim people that I've worked with, I've served with in Iraq, they've protected me, I've been with them.
[02:05:15.303 --> 02:05:20.507]  So I just, I'm not simplistic enough to believe that it's impossible.
[02:05:21.408 --> 02:05:23.549]  But, there needs to be a lot of work done.
[02:05:23.569 --> 02:05:32.831]  I think Christians, as a Christian, we need to listen to our Islamic brothers and sisters about what their concerns are in the world.
[02:05:33.411 --> 02:05:41.113]  And to see some commonalities, but I really think that there is possibilities for more peace and reconciliation.
[02:05:41.754 --> 02:05:49.296]  But there is a conflict, and Christians are being killed by Muslims, and at the same time, it goes the other way too.
[02:05:51.233 --> 02:05:52.814]  So a lot of honesty needs to be done.
[02:05:53.515 --> 02:05:58.379]  It's really hard to be honest about wrongs that have been done one to the other.
[02:05:58.499 --> 02:06:04.865]  Part of my book, Death Letter, I go over to Israel and I kind of walk around Jerusalem and try to get a sense of
[02:06:05.566 --> 02:06:11.430]  What is this inside me about Islam and Judaism and Christianity that kind of meets in this one city?
[02:06:11.991 --> 02:06:14.973]  What is it about that I need to fix in my life?
[02:06:14.993 --> 02:06:17.975]  Because I found myself profoundly angered by these issues.
[02:06:17.995 --> 02:06:21.138]  And I think a lot of veterans have a lot of anger towards Islam.
[02:06:21.558 --> 02:06:25.541]  And there's a good reason for that, given the wars that we've been fighting.
[02:06:26.241 --> 02:06:30.164]  But seeing the other as a human is really hard to do.
[02:06:30.505 --> 02:06:31.706]  But I think that's the first step.
[02:06:32.805 --> 02:06:41.827]  And to see that Muslims care about their children and their education, they care about their families, and starting on that human level can help me a lot.
[02:06:42.447 --> 02:06:44.107]  But I do think there's hope.
[02:06:44.787 --> 02:06:46.548]  I don't think anything's impossible in this world.
[02:06:48.748 --> 02:06:49.868]  Well, we'll leave it right there.
[02:06:49.888 --> 02:06:50.889]  That was great.
[02:06:51.449 --> 02:06:54.489]  We went over the hour mark, which is, I think, pretty impressive.
[02:06:55.970 --> 02:06:57.010]  You're watching the 52-hour
[02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:01.541]  Election coverage here at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:01.581 --> 02:07:11.148]  InfoWars.com forward slash show is the link in which you can find the free stream or you can go to Facebook, Alexander Emmerich Jones or our YouTube channel, the Alex Jones Channel.
[02:07:11.188 --> 02:07:12.529]  Spread those links far and wide.
[02:07:12.569 --> 02:07:13.630]  Today's the day, folks.
[02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:16.352]  If you're not voting right now, you...
[02:07:17.072 --> 02:07:17.992]  I hope you are soon.
[02:07:18.072 --> 02:07:21.154]  I'm going to take some calls when we come back from this break.
[02:07:21.174 --> 02:07:22.394]  877-789-2539.
[02:07:22.414 --> 02:07:22.974]  877-789-2539.
[02:07:23.374 --> 02:07:29.597]  I'm going to refill a little more coffee.
[02:07:29.617 --> 02:07:31.417]  This coffee's gotten cold.
[02:07:32.418 --> 02:07:33.838]  And walk Rev.
[02:07:33.878 --> 02:07:35.099]  Dr. David Peters out.
[02:07:35.259 --> 02:07:36.619]  Thank you for joining me today.
[02:07:36.739 --> 02:07:38.600]  Thank you for the blessing and the prayer.
[02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:41.381]  I think we need more prayer in our life.
[02:07:44.815 --> 02:07:49.638]  And prayer is, among other things, you know, just positive thinking.
[02:07:50.418 --> 02:07:51.299]  Being positive.
[02:07:51.459 --> 02:07:52.460]  Thinking positive.
[02:07:53.941 --> 02:07:54.481]  Always helps.
[02:07:55.241 --> 02:07:55.942]  Any situation.
[02:07:56.842 --> 02:07:59.304]  Even when it looks, it's always darkest before the dawn, as they say.
[02:07:59.804 --> 02:08:00.605]  So thank you for joining me.
[02:08:00.865 --> 02:08:04.327]  Check out his books on Amazon, Death Letter, and Post Traumatic God.
[02:08:05.188 --> 02:08:06.128]  And we're going to go to break now.
[02:08:06.148 --> 02:08:07.789]  When I come back, hopefully we'll take some more calls.
[02:08:08.770 --> 02:08:12.012]  We'll see if we can get Hillary a couple of votes on this poll, but I don't think so.
[02:08:13.939 --> 02:08:15.960]  Thanks for watching InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:08:16.020 --> 02:08:19.461]  Check out the specials we have at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:08:19.862 --> 02:08:25.084]  It's people going to the store and buying our products that we think are really great.
[02:08:25.384 --> 02:08:33.888]  And I'd use a lot of these DNA Force, Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, X2, Survival Shield, Brain Force.
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:36.041]  Oh, it's all there.
[02:08:36.481 --> 02:08:37.702]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.

[02:08:42.825 --> 02:08:44.766]  We want to go even farther.
[02:08:45.066 --> 02:08:47.448]  We want to have more reporters, more reports coming out.
[02:08:47.488 --> 02:08:51.771]  I mean, we're going gangbusters right now, but everybody is working to their maximum limit.
[02:08:52.691 --> 02:08:53.732]  Help us take it further.
[02:08:53.792 --> 02:08:55.073]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:08:55.093 --> 02:08:58.055]  We got free shipping, lots of specials, 30% off.

[02:09:01.317 --> 02:09:02.798]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:09:03.198 --> 02:09:05.079]  Get you a Pro-Pure water filter system.
[02:09:05.119 --> 02:09:07.421]  The King system is 30% off right now.
[02:09:07.461 --> 02:09:08.561]  If you're not filtering your water...
[02:09:09.622 --> 02:09:13.565]  That's the first step to getting your body clean is drinking clean water.
[02:09:14.025 --> 02:09:18.149]  And you can do it in the comfort of your own home and not depending on the government to do it.
[02:09:18.189 --> 02:09:19.450]  So with that, we'll go to break, guys.
[02:09:19.470 --> 02:09:20.571]  Give me like three or four minutes.
[02:09:20.611 --> 02:09:25.334]  I want to get some coffee, walk Reverend Peters out, and then we'll continue with your calls.
[02:09:25.414 --> 02:09:27.336]  I can't wait to hear what you have to say.
[02:09:27.356 --> 02:09:28.957]  You're watching the 52 Hour Broadcast.
[02:09:28.977 --> 02:09:29.898]  This is Rob Dew reporting.
[02:09:30.298 --> 02:09:32.580]  You can follow me on Twitter at DewsNews.
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:34.041]  D-E-W-S-N-E-W-Z.
[02:09:34.561 --> 02:09:35.082]  Roll that break.
[02:09:51.115 --> 02:09:52.136]  Brain Force is here.
[02:09:52.656 --> 02:09:54.937]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:09:55.217 --> 02:10:03.061]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:10:03.821 --> 02:10:07.403]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:10:07.423 --> 02:10:09.764]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:10:10.125 --> 02:10:13.646]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:10:13.686 --> 02:10:16.808]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:10:17.308 --> 02:10:22.092]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:10:22.632 --> 02:10:24.493]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[02:10:24.834 --> 02:10:29.277]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:10:29.417 --> 02:10:31.438]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:10:32.059 --> 02:10:33.520]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:33.920]  Exactly.
[02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:37.744]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:10:38.244 --> 02:10:46.232]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:10:51.073 --> 02:10:56.337]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words, and his was action.
[02:10:56.918 --> 02:10:58.459]  His was what he's done to women.
[02:10:58.479 --> 02:11:04.163]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[02:11:04.383 --> 02:11:06.705]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[02:11:07.045 --> 02:11:13.230]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:18.674]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[02:11:29.491 --> 02:11:32.254]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[02:11:33.114 --> 02:11:34.556]  It's a fight for our minds.
[02:11:35.236 --> 02:11:37.158]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.

[02:14:21.212 --> 02:14:28.738]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:14:29.098 --> 02:14:36.745]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[02:14:37.005 --> 02:14:39.107]  As president, I will make it clear.
[02:14:39.967 --> 02:14:44.728]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[02:14:45.288 --> 02:14:50.650]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[02:14:50.710 --> 02:14:53.750]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[02:14:54.090 --> 02:14:57.051]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[02:14:57.111 --> 02:14:59.672]  We came, we saw, he died.
[02:15:02.091 --> 02:15:03.812]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[02:15:04.473 --> 02:15:07.695]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[02:15:08.136 --> 02:15:16.022]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[02:15:17.944 --> 02:15:18.404]  The U.S.
[02:15:18.464 --> 02:15:22.066]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[02:15:22.426 --> 02:15:30.050]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[02:15:30.410 --> 02:15:32.751]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[02:15:32.771 --> 02:15:35.972]  Of course not, because she's... There's a really loud noise.
[02:15:35.992 --> 02:15:41.495]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[02:15:41.515 --> 02:15:43.736]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:52.041]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[02:16:21.334 --> 02:16:30.423]  If you can't see the irony in having a gun ban enforced by men with guns, well then you fail to understand why the Second Amendment was written in the first place.
[02:16:30.443 --> 02:16:33.305]  Throughout history, only slaves are disarmed.
[02:16:33.425 --> 02:16:37.189]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[02:16:37.329 --> 02:16:38.410]  The right of the people.
[02:16:38.450 --> 02:16:39.630]  The right of the people.
[02:16:39.710 --> 02:16:40.611]  The right of the people.
[02:16:40.691 --> 02:16:43.153]  To keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[02:16:43.193 --> 02:16:52.098]  For all of you actors out there who go to your red carpet events, surrounded by full battle rattle SWAT teams, while you accept your award for your latest violent movie.
[02:16:52.418 --> 02:17:03.725]  For all you politicians who spend your 9-5 days scheming up ways to take away my Second Amendment rights, meanwhile you have first responders on site there to protect you, I say this, come and take it.
[02:17:03.905 --> 02:17:06.287]  I have a strict gun control policy.
[02:17:06.847 --> 02:17:09.449]  If there's a gun around, I want to control it.
[02:17:10.069 --> 02:17:10.770]  Clint Eastwood.
[02:17:10.990 --> 02:17:11.530]  Go ahead.
[02:17:12.571 --> 02:17:13.492]  Make my day.
[02:17:13.632 --> 02:17:18.996]  Dads demand guns because it's me that's got to get up and go check out that noise at 2 a.m.
[02:17:19.236 --> 02:17:20.096]  Infowars.com
[02:17:32.625 --> 02:17:36.146]  You are watching the live 52-hour broadcast.
[02:17:36.206 --> 02:17:38.347]  We have not gone dark yet.
[02:17:39.027 --> 02:17:42.568]  For over 52 hours, we've been broadcasting on Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:17:43.108 --> 02:17:45.649]  Some radio stations have been picking it up across the country.
[02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:52.691]  We've been going on Facebook with brief interruptions to change the stream every four hours.
[02:17:54.572 --> 02:18:00.994]  And on YouTube, on a couple channels, the Alex Jones Channel and Prison Planet, which is Paul Joseph Watson's channel.
[02:18:02.612 --> 02:18:04.813]  And let's go, I'm going to go to InfoWars right now.
[02:18:06.414 --> 02:18:09.576]  Impartial Election Observer tweets support for Hillary.
[02:18:12.438 --> 02:18:14.439]  And I accidentally went to the Soros article.
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:18.342]  Leaked documents reveal expansive Soros funding to manipulate federal elections.
[02:18:19.262 --> 02:18:20.303]  Let's go back, there it is.
[02:18:20.323 --> 02:18:23.165]  This should give a final boost to Hillary's campaign.
[02:18:23.245 --> 02:18:24.426]  Great news!
[02:18:24.666 --> 02:18:26.407]  Yeah, Impartial Election Observer.
[02:18:28.323 --> 02:18:32.585]  Uh, there's leaked documents reveal Soros funding, uh, initially in elections.
[02:18:32.645 --> 02:18:34.867]  Video bill helps staggering Hillary and Dakar.
[02:18:34.887 --> 02:18:37.128]  He literally pushes her in the back like, come on, baby.
[02:18:37.148 --> 02:18:39.689]  Let's get to the Springsteen concert.
[02:18:40.450 --> 02:18:46.233]  Trump gets early lead and first in nation voting in tiny New Hampshire towns.
[02:18:48.534 --> 02:18:53.177]  Well, they were running a story on mainstream media, how she won in one town, four to two, the first one.
[02:18:54.998 --> 02:18:56.779]  So let's see, what's this saying?
[02:18:58.427 --> 02:19:05.372]  Under New Hampshire state law, communities with fewer than 100 voters get permission to open their polls at midnight and close them as soon as all registered voters have cast their ballots.
[02:19:05.512 --> 02:19:06.233]  Oh, that's interesting.
[02:19:06.753 --> 02:19:11.137]  Rob, I got a story when I was on the campaign trail with Richard.
[02:19:11.157 --> 02:19:13.719]  Is everybody hearing you right now?
[02:19:13.739 --> 02:19:14.499]  Can you stop by?
[02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:15.820]  Go ahead.
[02:19:17.089 --> 02:19:21.110]  We made a stop by Dixville when we were in New Hampshire.
[02:19:21.991 --> 02:19:29.413]  We were doing it for the primaries, and yeah, they are the first place in New Hampshire that votes, and they do vote at midnight, which is pretty cool.
[02:19:29.613 --> 02:19:31.974]  And that's usually kind of a story in New Hampshire.
[02:19:32.574 --> 02:19:35.515]  They like to run... Who won Dixville?
[02:19:35.835 --> 02:19:38.916]  It's like, yeah, what is it, 50 people?
[02:19:38.936 --> 02:19:39.576]  60 people?
[02:19:39.936 --> 02:19:40.176]  Yeah.
[02:19:40.597 --> 02:19:41.117]  Someone got 57 people?
[02:19:41.897 --> 02:19:46.880]  Trump was the overwhelming favorite in Millsfield with a 16-4 edge.
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:47.981]  That's interesting.
[02:19:49.962 --> 02:19:51.302]  How many electoral votes is that?
[02:19:52.403 --> 02:19:56.105]  Oh, I don't think that's any electoral votes, but that's just the precinct.
[02:19:57.446 --> 02:20:05.831]  And it looks like he's winning, let's see, he's winning over voters in three New Hampshire precincts, 32-25 over Hillary Clinton.
[02:20:06.851 --> 02:20:09.113]  So Trump is showing an early lead.
[02:20:10.402 --> 02:20:11.302]  In New Hampshire towns.
[02:20:11.322 --> 02:20:12.423]  You can find that on InfoWars.
[02:20:12.443 --> 02:20:13.303]  That's an AP story.
[02:20:13.323 --> 02:20:15.964]  Let's go to Drudge Report.
[02:20:16.904 --> 02:20:18.725]  Puma backed by Hillary's side.
[02:20:19.005 --> 02:20:22.606]  Yeah, there was a picture of her there at the latest campaign rally.
[02:20:23.506 --> 02:20:25.227]  Refresh Drudge all day.
[02:20:25.327 --> 02:20:25.827]  That's right.
[02:20:25.867 --> 02:20:26.907]  It's going to be going strong.
[02:20:26.947 --> 02:20:27.928]  Drudge will be going strong.
[02:20:27.948 --> 02:20:28.908]  We're going to be going strong.
[02:20:29.348 --> 02:20:32.749]  There's, uh, Gaga goes Nazi for Clinton.
[02:20:34.210 --> 02:20:38.651]  Paul Joseph Watson tweeted that out hours ago.
[02:20:40.382 --> 02:20:41.122]  A tale of tweets.
[02:20:41.182 --> 02:20:43.223]  Celebs unleash vulgar attacks.
[02:20:45.284 --> 02:20:47.705]  Snowden reveals a $30 fraud hack.
[02:20:47.925 --> 02:20:48.826]  Let's go to that story.
[02:20:49.426 --> 02:20:50.306]  That's from The Sun.
[02:20:50.987 --> 02:20:52.367]  How easy it is to hack in a U.S.
[02:20:52.387 --> 02:20:55.408]  voting machine with a 24-pound memory card.
[02:20:55.428 --> 02:20:56.629]  Hmm.
[02:20:57.689 --> 02:21:03.392]  Do you think Snowden would know a little bit about that, considering he was a contractor for the NSA?
[02:21:05.069 --> 02:21:15.579]  He showed his 2.4 million Twitter followers a video in which experts were able to change the number of votes for each candidate in the computer memory and also alter the paper trail backup.
[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:23.366]  But there's a thing called ballot images which in areas across the country they've made it to where
[02:21:24.532 --> 02:21:30.135]  Um, you don't have to keep those ballot images, even though that's against, you have to keep those.
[02:21:30.195 --> 02:21:31.796]  It's election law that you have to keep those.
[02:21:31.856 --> 02:21:34.958]  But in Texas, they're writing little executive orders.
[02:21:34.998 --> 02:21:41.922]  A guy named Keith Ingram is writing little executive decrees telling precincts they don't have to keep them.
[02:21:41.942 --> 02:21:43.603]  Hey, you don't have to keep the ballot images.
[02:21:43.623 --> 02:21:48.846]  I mean, it's the only way you could tell at the end of the day whether your vote was hacked or not.
[02:21:49.106 --> 02:21:49.987]  Well, we don't need that.
[02:21:51.345 --> 02:21:51.585]  No.
[02:21:51.605 --> 02:21:53.406]  We don't need paper ballots.
[02:21:53.446 --> 02:21:55.966]  We need centralized voting systems.
[02:21:56.626 --> 02:21:57.387]  Here are his tweets.
[02:21:57.407 --> 02:21:58.847]  Snowden's weighing in.
[02:22:21.408 --> 02:22:23.349]  Let's go back to InfoWars, see what's there.
[02:22:23.369 --> 02:22:26.211]  And then I'm gonna go to your calls.
[02:22:28.072 --> 02:22:29.914]  Let's go to all news.
[02:22:30.854 --> 02:22:32.595]  Trump surge is real, he will win.
[02:22:32.655 --> 02:22:36.198]  We had Roger Stone on last night looking at how the poll momentum is going.
[02:22:36.518 --> 02:22:39.020]  Hillary's campaigning in blue states.
[02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:40.841]  She's so worried.
[02:22:42.602 --> 02:22:43.302]  So worried.
[02:22:46.024 --> 02:22:48.306]  So we had a lot of great interviews last night.
[02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:52.702]  If you go to the Alex Jones Channel, you can check some of those out.
[02:22:54.003 --> 02:22:55.544]  I thought I was going to the Alex Jones Channel.
[02:22:56.465 --> 02:22:58.006]  I guess I erased off that.
[02:22:58.046 --> 02:22:59.127]  We'll pull that up in a second.
[02:22:59.847 --> 02:23:03.250]  Let's go to Dave in Montana.
[02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:04.691]  Is this the same Dave we just talked to?
[02:23:05.831 --> 02:23:07.772]  Uh, Dave, are you hanging on?
[02:23:07.792 --> 02:23:08.912]  Or did you call back?
[02:23:08.932 --> 02:23:11.613]  Yes, I've been hanging on all night.
[02:23:12.094 --> 02:23:13.054]  Right?
[02:23:13.814 --> 02:23:13.974]  No.
[02:23:14.014 --> 02:23:15.315]  With your headset.
[02:23:15.335 --> 02:23:15.895]  Hey, Rob.
[02:23:16.275 --> 02:23:17.056]  Yeah.
[02:23:17.236 --> 02:23:20.257]  I got a microphone and headset.
[02:23:21.557 --> 02:23:23.338]  You sound like you need a little sleep now, Dave.
[02:23:23.358 --> 02:23:23.818]  Go ahead.
[02:23:24.919 --> 02:23:25.659]  You're right.
[02:23:25.679 --> 02:23:27.940]  You're absolutely right, I do.
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:32.362]  But you guys are standing up for 52 hours.
[02:23:34.242 --> 02:23:35.443]  I'm going to stand up for
[02:23:37.143 --> 02:23:38.324]  24.
[02:23:37.764 --> 02:23:38.324]  All right.
[02:23:39.005 --> 02:23:40.966]  Yeah.
[02:23:40.986 --> 02:23:41.747]  No, I'm sorry.
[02:23:41.807 --> 02:23:47.511]  And I really apologize for nothing.
[02:23:50.293 --> 02:23:50.633]  I don't.
[02:23:52.054 --> 02:23:59.340]  Rob, I gotta tell you, there was a, I was, this is my third time calling into the show tonight.
[02:24:05.063 --> 02:24:06.144]  Give us something good, Dave.
[02:24:06.164 --> 02:24:06.524]  Come on.
[02:24:06.544 --> 02:24:08.225]  I'm telling you, brother.
[02:24:08.546 --> 02:24:09.226]  I'm here.
[02:24:09.566 --> 02:24:10.827]  I'm on the microphone.
[02:24:10.988 --> 02:24:11.208]  I know.
[02:24:11.248 --> 02:24:12.349]  Let me give you something good.
[02:24:12.369 --> 02:24:20.655]  Okay.
[02:24:21.616 --> 02:24:21.996]  Listen.
[02:24:23.477 --> 02:24:28.501]  Stefan Molyneux, who was on the show tonight, and he was fabulous.
[02:24:29.021 --> 02:24:29.782]  That guy.
[02:24:29.802 --> 02:24:33.685]  Jesus, I wish I could speak.
[02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:38.793]  As well as he could, right?
[02:24:40.275 --> 02:24:49.482]  Yeah, you know, at the end of our interview last night, Stefan said if I didn't have to breathe and pause, I would do it, figure out a way to circular breathe.
[02:24:50.063 --> 02:24:57.128]  He is an eloquent speaker, let me tell you, and he has his ideas fully affixed and a great vocabulary to boot.
[02:24:57.509 --> 02:24:58.650]  Dave, thanks for calling.
[02:24:58.670 --> 02:25:00.351]  I'm going to jump to Robert in Pennsylvania.
[02:25:01.592 --> 02:25:02.433]  Robert, who are you voting for?
[02:25:04.662 --> 02:25:05.502]  Yeah, go ahead, Robert.
[02:25:06.262 --> 02:25:07.843]  Oh yeah, Trump's got my vote, buddy.
[02:25:09.463 --> 02:25:09.883]  Right.
[02:25:09.903 --> 02:25:10.624]  Without a doubt.
[02:25:10.764 --> 02:25:12.304]  What part of Pennsylvania are you in?
[02:25:13.064 --> 02:25:16.105]  I live southwest from about half an hour east of like Pittsburgh.
[02:25:16.605 --> 02:25:16.825]  Okay.
[02:25:17.805 --> 02:25:20.226]  That's almost in the Ohio, West Virginia area.
[02:25:20.246 --> 02:25:21.586]  Yeah, it's not that far.
[02:25:21.606 --> 02:25:23.087]  Like an hour and a half drive to get in the boat.
[02:25:24.196 --> 02:25:24.756]  Yeah, I know.
[02:25:47.955 --> 02:25:50.137]  It's just something like that drives me absolutely crazy.
[02:25:50.177 --> 02:25:55.223]  Me and my friends, we planned on leaving about, well it's 9.30 now, about an hour.
[02:25:55.303 --> 02:25:57.906]  We said about 10.30 we're going to all head down there together.
[02:25:59.187 --> 02:26:05.574]  And in this area, and I travel a good bit around here, I see Trump signs everywhere.
[02:26:05.874 --> 02:26:06.415]  Everywhere.
[02:26:06.836 --> 02:26:08.617]  And not a damn Hillary one.
[02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:13.701]  Not a single one can be found and like all these polls and I'm guilty.
[02:26:13.761 --> 02:26:16.882]  I'll switch to the mainstream media every now and then.
[02:26:16.942 --> 02:26:17.983]  It's so close!
[02:26:18.483 --> 02:26:19.323]  It's so close!
[02:26:20.464 --> 02:26:21.264]  I'm laughing.
[02:26:21.624 --> 02:26:31.727]  When I went to, I used to, I graduated high school just outside of Pittsburgh on the other side of Pittsburgh over in Westmoreland County and went to a dinner with seven or eight people there.
[02:26:32.107 --> 02:26:33.448]  Only one of them was voting for Hillary.
[02:26:34.793 --> 02:26:36.437]  And he didn't seem too happy about it either.
[02:26:36.457 --> 02:26:37.981]  He's actually a Bernie Sanders supporter.
[02:26:38.643 --> 02:26:40.207]  But these were all registered Democrats.
[02:26:40.387 --> 02:26:41.389]  And they said, we're voting Trump.
[02:26:42.051 --> 02:26:42.913]  We're sick of the Clintons.
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:51.002]  Yeah, I mean, you don't get more establishment than that, and I don't even understand how the Bernie people can go to her direction, because that was one of their big things.
[02:26:51.042 --> 02:26:54.203]  They want to fight against the establishment, but no, they're all backing her.
[02:26:54.703 --> 02:26:56.064]  We're going after the big banks!
[02:26:56.204 --> 02:26:57.104]  Go Hillary!
[02:26:57.724 --> 02:26:58.244]  Oh, yeah.
[02:26:58.424 --> 02:26:59.225]  Yeah, my ass.
[02:26:59.245 --> 02:27:01.425]  I don't understand it.
[02:27:01.685 --> 02:27:04.286]  Hey, since you brought up Russia, here's a New York Times article.
[02:27:04.766 --> 02:27:08.107]  Cash flowed to Clinton Foundation amid Russian uranium deal.
[02:27:09.608 --> 02:27:09.688]  Oh!
[02:27:10.950 --> 02:27:12.952]  But wait, it's probably not the Russians in that play.
[02:27:12.992 --> 02:27:13.852]  It's probably Trump.
[02:27:15.394 --> 02:27:16.054]  But there it is.
[02:27:16.074 --> 02:27:25.763]  The article titled, How a Russian Atomic Energy Agency, Rosatom, has taken a Canadian company with uranium mining stakes stretching from Central Asia to the American West.
[02:27:27.264 --> 02:27:33.109]  But the untold story is one that not involves a Russian president, but also a former American president and a woman who would be the next one.
[02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.790]  Wow.
[02:27:35.711 --> 02:27:39.074]  The Canadian mining industry have been major donors to the Clinton Foundation.
[02:27:40.848 --> 02:27:41.889]  What a surprise.
[02:27:41.929 --> 02:27:42.890]  What a surprise.
[02:27:43.610 --> 02:27:44.591]  Are we surprised?
[02:27:45.352 --> 02:27:48.794]  When she says it's Trump and Russia, it's truly she means me and Russia.
[02:27:48.834 --> 02:27:53.418]  When she says there's no election fraud, she really means it's me gonna do the election fraud.
[02:27:54.439 --> 02:27:56.660]  Don't pay attention to the person behind the room.
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:27:57.101]  Exactly.
[02:27:57.821 --> 02:27:59.022]  She's on parole assurings.
[02:27:59.903 --> 02:28:01.444]  Robert, be sure you get out there and vote.
[02:28:01.484 --> 02:28:03.266]  Let's go to Alex in North Carolina.
[02:28:04.363 --> 02:28:06.065]  He wants to rant about Hillary.
[02:28:06.486 --> 02:28:07.287]  Go ahead, Alex.
[02:28:07.347 --> 02:28:08.849]  Hey, guys.
[02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:11.212]  I'm definitely a Trump supporter.
[02:28:12.594 --> 02:28:20.966]  What I just want to say is, you know, I've listened on and off here and there with your show, and my whole thing is besides
[02:28:22.241 --> 02:28:48.127]  The election itself, the most important day of our history currently, and we're actually having someone run with not even just a little bit of scandal, a little bit of... We're talking about from pedophile rings, satanic cults, secret arms deal, secret foundations, with the money laundering and this and that, and surrounded by people, their emails are exposed.
[02:28:48.587 --> 02:28:49.248]  I don't think so.
[02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:06.871]  Am I in opposite world?
[02:29:06.911 --> 02:29:08.511]  Do I live in opposite world?
[02:29:08.812 --> 02:29:10.392]  I mean, what is going on?
[02:29:10.492 --> 02:29:13.853]  I mean, yeah, Trump, yeah, he's not political, but you know what?
[02:29:13.893 --> 02:29:17.235]  That's probably the best thing that we need for the country now to swing.
[02:29:17.495 --> 02:29:21.156]  I'm not a Republican and I'm not a Democrat, but let's swing back a little bit.
[02:29:21.196 --> 02:29:22.777]  Like, let's bring their jobs back.
[02:29:22.817 --> 02:29:25.518]  I mean, these are all common sense things.
[02:29:25.998 --> 02:29:27.999]  I got to rant just for a second because
[02:29:28.559 --> 02:29:33.620]  The hypocrisy of just the Clintons themselves.
[02:29:33.660 --> 02:29:37.521]  I mean, just look at Bill with the women and then Hillary.
[02:29:37.541 --> 02:29:40.142]  She hits Secret Service with a Bible.
[02:29:40.482 --> 02:29:42.282]  She curses at people.
[02:29:42.682 --> 02:29:44.423]  You look at her, you get fired.
[02:29:44.943 --> 02:29:47.704]  She's falling down, stumbling, bumbling.
[02:29:47.724 --> 02:29:49.404]  I mean, she's being held up.
[02:29:49.484 --> 02:29:50.784]  I mean, is this a joke?
[02:29:50.904 --> 02:29:53.465]  And you've got outside countries supporting.
[02:29:53.865 --> 02:29:57.746]  You talk about Reagan and they want to throw the alarms on Russia.
[02:29:58.266 --> 02:30:03.989]  Meanwhile, you have all this inside deception and... We're not talking about a little bit of scandal.
[02:30:04.029 --> 02:30:06.671]  We're talking about... I mean, literally, we have people coming out.
[02:30:06.711 --> 02:30:09.172]  There's a soft coup going on, okay?
[02:30:09.552 --> 02:30:14.155]  And you're telling me, on the most important day, that someone could actually vote for Hillary?
[02:30:14.315 --> 02:30:16.196]  I mean, you even got the machines rigged.
[02:30:16.836 --> 02:30:18.497]  I mean, what is going on?
[02:30:18.657 --> 02:30:24.320]  At this point, they should throw her on the ground and she should be saying, you know, they should be telling her, stop resisting.
[02:30:24.380 --> 02:30:25.001]  You know what I mean?
[02:30:25.021 --> 02:30:27.422]  At this point, they need to get the whole lot
[02:30:28.030 --> 02:30:28.570]  You're a sexist!
[02:30:58.210 --> 02:31:01.132]  I've had enough of this sexism here on my show.
[02:31:01.152 --> 02:31:07.877]  You know, as you were ranting, Alex, I was showing some of my favorite Ben Garrison cartoons.
[02:31:08.657 --> 02:31:18.844]  One, Hillary running from her past, who's got bloody hands, and Benghazi and the cattle futures, and Travelgate, and Whitewater, and then her Groundhog Day cleanse.
[02:31:18.864 --> 02:31:23.868]  She doesn't see her shadow because it's filled with bills, raves, and Benghazi, and her sniper fire, and
[02:31:24.548 --> 02:31:29.611]  Vince Foster and the Clinton Foundation, and then the Clinton House of Horrors.
[02:31:29.691 --> 02:31:48.884]  The house, the crooked house of Hillary Clinton with the FBI banging on the door, radical Islamists pushing gays off buildings, and here comes, and the skeletons in the closet, Bill chasing women, the influence for sale, the money laundering, and here comes Trump ready to knock it down.
[02:31:49.004 --> 02:31:50.265]  I condemn this property.
[02:31:50.405 --> 02:31:51.386]  Disgusting.
[02:31:52.250 --> 02:31:55.074]  Yeah, I agree with you and I think a lot of people agree with you.
[02:31:55.134 --> 02:31:57.857]  What's the sentiment like in North Carolina where you live?
[02:31:57.877 --> 02:31:59.479]  A lot of Hillary supporters?
[02:32:00.993 --> 02:32:03.054]  No, I honestly don't see it.
[02:32:03.114 --> 02:32:06.256]  That's what blows my mind, is all this media.
[02:32:06.837 --> 02:32:14.002]  But the main thing about it is, this is the President, who could be the President of the United States of America.
[02:32:14.542 --> 02:32:22.947]  And this person, she has a memory issue, she even says, I don't recall, I don't... And then she remembers certain things, and she's falling down.
[02:32:23.948 --> 02:32:26.670]  Just looking at that, but then all this other stuff.
[02:32:27.330 --> 02:32:31.234]  This person cannot be the president of the United States.
[02:32:31.715 --> 02:32:33.436]  I'm all for a woman president.
[02:32:33.456 --> 02:32:38.041]  I'm all for, you know, believe it or not, let me just say this last thing.
[02:32:38.642 --> 02:32:39.863]  If there was a way
[02:32:40.620 --> 02:32:47.202]  That there was like a holy, like awesome person that was of pure good.
[02:32:47.222 --> 02:32:53.223]  A one world like thing would be amazing, but it could never happen because we're all humans.
[02:32:53.843 --> 02:32:57.384]  And then there's the part of the good and the bad, the right and the wrong.
[02:32:57.824 --> 02:32:59.885]  And if you're doing bad stuff,
[02:33:00.445 --> 02:33:05.528]  And you can't recall, and you're doing, and you're laughing at people's death, and you're involved.
[02:33:05.908 --> 02:33:17.974]  How can you be the President of the United States and stand up in front of the people, and actually not have such a conscious... I mean, we've got veterans killing themselves 22 times a day.
[02:33:18.414 --> 02:33:29.760]  I mean, how could you be that person of the United States of America over all the people, regardless of gender, regardless of race, regardless of whatever, and have that much corruption?
[02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:32.822]  What is she doing what we don't know about?
[02:33:33.123 --> 02:33:35.865]  And what will happen when she is the president?
[02:33:36.165 --> 02:33:39.508]  I mean, why do you want to poke the Russians?
[02:33:39.988 --> 02:33:41.210]  They're not doing anything.
[02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:43.411]  We're encroaching around them.
[02:33:43.632 --> 02:33:47.235]  Of course they're going to expand and belly out and push back.
[02:33:47.555 --> 02:33:48.656]  But the bottom line is,
[02:33:49.196 --> 02:33:57.687]  Until I start seeing planes over the country, then I'll go up to arms and defend our country on our domestic soil.
[02:33:57.987 --> 02:34:00.150]  But I mean, what are you doing?
[02:34:00.330 --> 02:34:01.431]  Why are you causing?
[02:34:01.732 --> 02:34:03.274]  Why are you going to do this to us?
[02:34:03.654 --> 02:34:04.896]  Please don't do this to us.
[02:34:05.676 --> 02:34:06.777]  Just drop out.
[02:34:06.877 --> 02:34:08.078]  Just stop.
[02:34:08.498 --> 02:34:09.499]  The game is done.
[02:34:09.779 --> 02:34:10.820]  You're exposed.
[02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:12.621]  The intelligence officers are doing this stuff.
[02:34:13.782 --> 02:34:17.864]  Half of them are being told to turn in on Monday your resignation.
[02:34:17.984 --> 02:34:20.806]  The NYPD has all that info on the pedophile.
[02:34:21.106 --> 02:34:22.447]  Why isn't this stuff coming out?
[02:34:22.487 --> 02:34:27.710]  You guys gotta push this NYPD to come out and expose this.
[02:34:28.231 --> 02:34:34.415]  I'm done ranting, but this has been building up for a while now, and I just cannot.
[02:34:34.975 --> 02:34:44.399]  Honestly, with the amount of stuff that has come out, it makes me sick to my stomach that this person... Now, you know, Trump said some bad things on a bus and some stuff, but you know what?
[02:34:44.420 --> 02:34:54.104]  He wasn't trying to beat the president then, and people are people, and if you don't tell me... You can't tell me that you've never been in a group in life where someone said something inappropriate.
[02:34:54.504 --> 02:34:55.545]  Everyone's guilty of that.
[02:34:55.565 --> 02:35:01.007]  I don't care who you are, but the president... Well, then she has the gall to stand behind a bunch of rappers and tell them how great they are.
[02:35:01.027 --> 02:35:02.148]  You know, and I got...
[02:35:03.228 --> 02:35:22.922]  Rappers can do their thing if they're going to do it, but when you have the mass media pushing this to people to create that gang culture, to get people into that mindset that the only way to be successful in life is to be a drug dealer or a gang member in that community, instead of working hard and pulling yourself out of that poverty.
[02:35:23.603 --> 02:35:26.204]  And she stands with those people and says they're great.
[02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:57.230]  Great examples for women, you know as Beyonce's breaking windows on cars and and stomping on police cars and calling for violence against police through her through her artwork You gotta wonder you gotta wonder how far and yeah, I think you you've eloquently said how I think 80% of the country feels and I think it should be 80 20 because there's gonna be 20% of people I played when I first got on the air played that
[02:35:58.154 --> 02:36:00.615]  That gentleman that I met in Philadelphia.
[02:36:00.635 --> 02:36:02.816]  Who's gonna be a Hillary supporter no matter what.
[02:36:03.456 --> 02:36:04.977]  I can bring up anything I wanted.
[02:36:05.197 --> 02:36:05.777]  Doesn't matter.
[02:36:06.057 --> 02:36:06.677]  She's clear.
[02:36:06.957 --> 02:36:07.598]  She's fine.
[02:36:08.198 --> 02:36:08.838]  Go Hillary.
[02:36:09.158 --> 02:36:09.778]  Go Hillary.
[02:36:11.359 --> 02:36:11.939]  And it's sad.
[02:36:12.159 --> 02:36:16.541]  It's sad that you can't show people what's going on and all the evidence.
[02:36:16.941 --> 02:36:20.763]  Even if half of what we brought up or what you just brought up is true.
[02:36:21.063 --> 02:36:21.523]  Just half.
[02:36:21.743 --> 02:36:22.303]  Or a quarter.
[02:36:23.184 --> 02:36:23.744]  It's bad.
[02:36:26.045 --> 02:36:26.425]  And yet,
[02:36:27.344 --> 02:36:32.788]  We're going to allow the mainstream media to put her in office because some people go, I just can't vote for Trump.
[02:36:32.808 --> 02:36:35.590]  He said, he said some bad things one time.
[02:36:36.971 --> 02:36:41.814]  And you know, he got sued and his dad gave him money.
[02:36:41.894 --> 02:36:43.315]  That's the only reason he's successful.
[02:36:43.815 --> 02:36:45.236]  There's plenty of people who've lost money.
[02:36:46.858 --> 02:36:55.464]  Look at MC Hammer went through millions of dollars, you know, that he, that he made on his own talent.
[02:36:56.263 --> 02:36:57.523]  It's his right to blow that money.
[02:36:58.944 --> 02:37:03.205]  Probably made him a better person blowing through that money and becoming poor again and having to build himself back up.
[02:37:06.766 --> 02:37:07.746]  Thanks for the call, Alex.
[02:37:07.766 --> 02:37:08.286]  That was great.
[02:37:09.246 --> 02:37:12.467]  I'll put you down in the Trump column, by the way, because I'm pretty sure you're voting for Trump.
[02:37:13.667 --> 02:37:16.368]  Let's go to Cynthia in Montana.
[02:37:16.388 --> 02:37:20.189]  I seem to be getting a lot of calls from Montana and North Carolina right now.
[02:37:20.229 --> 02:37:21.109]  A lot of active listeners there.
[02:37:21.129 --> 02:37:22.229]  Hey, Cynthia, how's it going?
[02:37:22.249 --> 02:37:24.030]  Oh, it's all right.
[02:37:25.131 --> 02:37:26.812]  What part of Montana are you calling from?
[02:37:27.793 --> 02:37:31.014]  I'm calling from the Continental Divide in Butte.
[02:37:31.855 --> 02:37:32.836]  Ah, excellent.
[02:37:32.916 --> 02:37:33.956]  And I guess you voted for Trump?
[02:37:34.837 --> 02:37:35.657]  I certainly did.
[02:37:38.679 --> 02:37:44.843]  My family came over on the Mayflower, my ancestors, and have fought in all of the wars.
[02:37:46.303 --> 02:37:48.765]  I love the Constitution and what it stands for.
[02:37:49.814 --> 02:38:01.598]  And with Hillary Clinton, all I can see are FEMA camps, nuclear bombs, loss of freedom, loss of the right to be a person and an individual.
[02:38:03.538 --> 02:38:09.260]  I'm so grateful that Mr. Trump stood up and took the reins, and I know he's going to win.
[02:38:10.834 --> 02:38:15.737]  I like how he describes how he took the arrows that they kept shooting at him, and he didn't stop.
[02:38:15.917 --> 02:38:16.678]  He just kept going.
[02:38:16.698 --> 02:38:19.440]  Well, he turned around and threw them back, is what he did.
[02:38:19.580 --> 02:38:21.541]  He could have dropped that at any time and said, you know what?
[02:38:22.141 --> 02:38:22.602]  Screw it.
[02:38:23.562 --> 02:38:24.323]  Take Jeb Bush.
[02:38:24.763 --> 02:38:27.505]  Let's have it be another Bush-Clinton election.
[02:38:27.525 --> 02:38:32.548]  Because that's kind of what our country deserves, is another Bush-Clinton election.
[02:38:33.068 --> 02:38:33.989]  We kind of deserve that.
[02:38:34.767 --> 02:38:36.328]  Oh God, no, I don't think so.
[02:38:37.048 --> 02:38:39.389]  I was a Democrat my whole entire life.
[02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:41.970]  This is the first time I've ever voted Republican.
[02:38:42.030 --> 02:38:43.930]  I voted Independent a couple of times.
[02:38:45.491 --> 02:38:49.992]  And, you know, there's no other way to go.
[02:38:51.973 --> 02:38:52.653]  There just isn't.
[02:38:53.234 --> 02:38:54.854]  He seems to be the answer to me.
[02:38:54.894 --> 02:39:02.597]  I kind of hoped that maybe Jesse Ventura would run with him, but I like Mike Spence, so it's all good.
[02:39:02.941 --> 02:39:03.601]  Let me ask you this.
[02:39:03.621 --> 02:39:05.782]  Do you know any Hillary supporters in your area?
[02:39:07.702 --> 02:39:08.322]  My sister.
[02:39:08.922 --> 02:39:10.282]  And she's not in my area.
[02:39:10.343 --> 02:39:11.323]  She's in Spokane.
[02:39:12.363 --> 02:39:14.803]  But she's a diehard Hillary.
[02:39:15.564 --> 02:39:23.145]  And I can't... My nephew and I tease her about, you know, we know she drank the Kool-Aid, but we love her anyway.
[02:39:25.686 --> 02:39:25.946]  Yeah.
[02:39:26.826 --> 02:39:27.306]  I hear you.
[02:39:29.226 --> 02:39:31.967]  Why is it that people can look at all the things...
[02:39:33.388 --> 02:39:39.833]  I don't understand it.
[02:39:40.693 --> 02:39:51.721]  I don't see how anyone in their right mind could see anything positive coming from her lack of leadership.
[02:39:51.781 --> 02:39:53.222]  She doesn't have any leadership.
[02:39:53.342 --> 02:39:56.585]  Everything she's ever tried to do has become a disaster.
[02:39:56.605 --> 02:39:57.465]  I'm 63 years old.
[02:40:00.567 --> 02:40:10.997]  Uh, retired from, as the Chemical Dependency Counselor, and I was listening to Reverend Peters and some of the things that he had to say, and this country is really in a spiritual battle.
[02:40:11.017 --> 02:40:19.626]  Um, probably the whole world, you know, with the Illuminati and, and the New World Order, you know, it's just, it's beyond me.
[02:40:20.947 --> 02:40:23.469]  But I just woke up two years ago, you know?
[02:40:24.983 --> 02:40:27.765]  You know, I just want to shake people and say, can't you see?
[02:40:28.065 --> 02:40:29.225]  Can't you just wake up?
[02:40:30.066 --> 02:40:31.967]  You know, that's sometimes what I feel like doing.
[02:40:31.987 --> 02:40:40.471]  Yeah, because it's everything I ever learned in life turned out to be almost the opposite.
[02:40:40.752 --> 02:40:40.972]  Yeah.
[02:40:41.612 --> 02:40:42.332]  It's crazy, isn't it?
[02:40:42.953 --> 02:40:48.756]  How the mainstream media can manipulate reality in such a way that up is down, left is right.
[02:40:50.279 --> 02:40:56.924]  Bad is good, and Hillary is possibly going to be our next president.
[02:40:57.664 --> 02:40:58.725]  That's a scary thought.
[02:40:59.325 --> 02:41:00.486]  That is a scary thought.
[02:41:01.467 --> 02:41:17.438]  You know, at my age, I'll be one of the first to go to the fem camps because I'm on Social Security Disability, and I live alone with my two kitties, and I just can't imagine what life is going to be like if she gets in office.
[02:41:17.818 --> 02:41:19.419]  I don't think she'll stay there long, though.
[02:41:20.658 --> 02:41:22.639]  No, but then we'll get Tim Kaine.
[02:41:23.219 --> 02:41:25.539]  Oh God, and that is just as scary.
[02:41:26.139 --> 02:41:28.500]  Yeah, we don't even know anything about this guy yet.
[02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:29.880]  We haven't really dug into him.
[02:41:30.500 --> 02:41:31.721]  We know some of what he's about.
[02:41:32.621 --> 02:41:37.382]  Well, I think that the debate with Mike Pence was enough to know what he's about.
[02:41:37.622 --> 02:41:39.323]  Yeah, he's a gibbering idiot.
[02:41:41.123 --> 02:41:47.945]  And to have him lead our country, I can't think of anything worse at the moment except maybe Hillary Clinton.
[02:41:49.435 --> 02:41:57.399]  I joined Ancestry.com a couple of years ago, right after I woke up and started looking into my past.
[02:41:58.319 --> 02:42:04.463]  And I'm a direct descendant of the Merovingian Kings and the Plantagenets.
[02:42:04.483 --> 02:42:11.926]  And we came over on the Mayflower and then we were in Jamestown and some in Plymouth and then moved our way through.
[02:42:12.126 --> 02:42:17.389]  And I just thank God that my mother's side of the family married, well actually both sides
[02:42:17.850 --> 02:42:20.373]  Married into some Cherokees, so my blood got mixed.
[02:42:20.834 --> 02:42:32.349]  You know, from what I've read about the bloodlines and the Illuminati bloodlines, and what they've been up to for millennia, you know, forever.
[02:42:33.271 --> 02:42:36.213]  Yeah, if you want to go down a rabbit hole, get Bloodlines of the Illuminati.
[02:42:36.253 --> 02:42:38.275]  We do have it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:42:39.556 --> 02:42:40.497]  Thanks for calling, Cynthia.
[02:42:40.517 --> 02:42:41.418]  It was a great call.
[02:42:42.238 --> 02:42:44.460]  We're in the midst of our 52-hour live broadcast.
[02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:51.306]  If you just tuned in, if somebody just sent you a link and you don't know what you're watching right now, yeah, we're in the midst of 52 hours going live.
[02:42:51.346 --> 02:42:52.647]  We started at 11 a.m.
[02:42:52.687 --> 02:42:54.809]  yesterday, and we're going until 3 p.m.
[02:42:54.869 --> 02:42:55.329]  tomorrow.
[02:42:57.371 --> 02:43:00.033]  We still have a whole day and a half left.
[02:43:01.215 --> 02:43:03.157]  And right now we're running some amazing sales.
[02:43:03.637 --> 02:43:12.765]  The one way we fund ourselves is by having an online store and having people go buy great products that they use and tell their friends about.
[02:43:15.083 --> 02:43:18.424]  So it's a win-win situation, as Alex likes to say, a 360 win.
[02:43:19.904 --> 02:43:24.965]  Right now we've got 25% off Biome Defense, 30% off Supermail Vitality, 30% off DNA Force.
[02:43:24.985 --> 02:43:26.546]  This is all with free shipping, by the way.
[02:43:26.886 --> 02:43:29.166]  So every time I say something, add, and free shipping.

[02:43:45.463 --> 02:43:47.364]  Free shipping store wide.
[02:43:47.384 --> 02:43:51.026]  I'm going to underline that three times.
[02:43:51.466 --> 02:43:53.007]  Also, 30% off Silver Bullet.
[02:43:53.307 --> 02:43:54.528]  30% off DNA Force.
[02:43:54.548 --> 02:43:55.208]  I already said that.
[02:43:55.228 --> 02:43:56.869]  25% off Biome Defense.
[02:43:59.951 --> 02:44:00.872]  How's your gut doing?
[02:44:01.852 --> 02:44:02.713]  You feeling run down?
[02:44:02.873 --> 02:44:03.993]  Maybe it's all in your gut.
[02:44:05.014 --> 02:44:08.216]  You know, the saying we are what we eat is very true.
[02:44:10.470 --> 02:44:16.896]  And one way to do that is to put in natural bacteria.
[02:44:16.916 --> 02:44:19.759]  And this one has 25 billion live and active cultures.
[02:44:20.259 --> 02:44:22.722]  Probiotic bacteria in 23 different strains.
[02:44:23.843 --> 02:44:27.106]  Goes into your body and helps your food digest better.
[02:44:27.126 --> 02:44:32.011]  And when you digest your food better, your immune system is going to be better.
[02:44:34.906 --> 02:44:51.947]  Let's go to John in North Carolina and then I want to go to a video how an undercover journalist, and I believe I've met this person, I'm not going to give out her name in case, I don't know if she gives out her name in the video because I haven't watched it yet, but she wears a full burka and has offered Huma Abedin's ballot.
[02:44:54.991 --> 02:44:56.192]  Part of Project Veritas.
[02:44:56.612 --> 02:44:58.514]  Let's go to John in North Carolina first.
[02:44:58.534 --> 02:45:01.356]  We'll clear out this last batch of calls.
[02:45:01.416 --> 02:45:04.859]  John, who are you going to vote for in this election, this historic election?
[02:45:04.879 --> 02:45:08.503]  I'm going to go with Donald Trump.
[02:45:08.963 --> 02:45:16.129]  And the reason is, he said, we will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[02:45:17.070 --> 02:45:21.834]  And that's when I knew that Donald Trump was my candidate, or my president.
[02:45:23.524 --> 02:45:30.887]  I just want to say that I absolutely love these special broadcasts you guys put on in a time where there's so much collusion with the mainstream media.
[02:45:31.788 --> 02:45:38.571]  InfoWars is obviously sharing the truth and it's kind of calming and refreshing at the same time.
[02:45:38.591 --> 02:45:42.553]  I actually get angry listening to Fox and NBC.
[02:45:43.053 --> 02:45:45.514]  I turn that stuff off and put on InfoWars.
[02:45:47.685 --> 02:45:54.008]  Yeah, you know, I think it was Cavuto played that tape of Obama saying, yeah, if you're, if you vote, you're a citizen.
[02:45:54.909 --> 02:46:02.773]  After the lady who's ill here illegally says, I feel they're all citizens because they contribute.
[02:46:04.674 --> 02:46:10.878]  You know, if I moved to Mexico just because I contribute, I had a friend moved to Mexico, lived there for many years.
[02:46:11.994 --> 02:46:13.175]  He didn't get to vote in their elections.
[02:46:13.495 --> 02:46:14.416]  He was never a citizen.
[02:46:14.916 --> 02:46:15.757]  That's the way it works.
[02:46:16.077 --> 02:46:17.899]  You become a citizen, then you get to vote.
[02:46:18.239 --> 02:46:29.449]  It doesn't work because you feel like you want to come here and take advantage of the success we've had and get some free stuff and then get to vote too as well so you can continue getting free stuff.
[02:46:29.469 --> 02:46:30.149]  It doesn't work like that.
[02:46:30.169 --> 02:46:33.933]  You have to become a citizen first and it's a long road and it does cost money.
[02:46:34.233 --> 02:46:38.376]  So don't come here unless you're ready to do what it takes to become a citizen.
[02:46:39.177 --> 02:46:39.938]  Your thoughts, John?
[02:46:40.848 --> 02:46:42.489]  Yeah, no, I agree completely.
[02:46:42.509 --> 02:46:56.994]  You know, my father was in the military, and there are some ways that you can become a citizen, you know, join the military, but something else that I'd like to impart with the listeners is ignore the polls, guys.
[02:46:57.114 --> 02:46:59.295]  It's a straight-up demoralization campaign.
[02:46:59.315 --> 02:47:03.217]  Whether they say Trump's ahead or he's behind, regardless, go out and vote.
[02:47:06.465 --> 02:47:16.689]  It's hard for many of us to believe because of the fact that we've watched or seen the WikiLeaks and we listen to you guys, but a lot of folks do not know who they're going to vote for.
[02:47:17.109 --> 02:47:19.530]  As crazy as that sounds to us, they still don't know.
[02:47:21.251 --> 02:47:29.174]  So what I would like to impart with everyone that's listening is if you can, if you have time, go out and show your support.
[02:47:29.434 --> 02:47:33.636]  Go to the polls, hand out sample ballots so that folks know
[02:47:34.338 --> 02:47:42.405]  What to put down when they can, when they get in there, and just let others know that they are not alone.
[02:47:42.725 --> 02:47:49.751]  There are so many of us centipedes, we're nimble navigators, we're going to derail the Trump train into the White House.
[02:47:50.852 --> 02:47:53.614]  But we can't do it unless we get out there and vote for him.
[02:47:55.876 --> 02:47:57.497]  I agree, and you gotta show your support.
[02:47:57.517 --> 02:48:00.119]  You gotta let people know there's strength in numbers.
[02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:02.861]  Here's the article on Infowars.com.
[02:48:02.941 --> 02:48:07.465]  Undercover journalist in full burka offered Huma Abedin's ballot.
[02:48:08.306 --> 02:48:16.131]  You can see her right there walking into the polling station, and she's going to be offered Huma Abedin's ballot.
[02:48:16.172 --> 02:48:17.733]  This is from Project Veritas.
[02:48:17.953 --> 02:48:21.796]  Just totally on fire, just like the rest of the alternative media.
[02:48:23.433 --> 02:48:27.556]  But these guys have hit so many home runs this past election.
[02:48:27.616 --> 02:48:34.180]  There's enough that we've got on the Democratic machine that we could go after them for years.
[02:48:35.041 --> 02:48:47.530]  And they don't, even if they do win, if they're somehow able to pull this off, this fraud that is Hillary Clinton and put her in office, if they're able to pull this off, there's so much dirt on them.
[02:48:48.877 --> 02:48:55.500]  All we have to do is just look at the pile of dirt again and go, oh, there's another thing, there's another... We have years worth of material.
[02:48:55.740 --> 02:48:56.940]  We haven't even mined yet.
[02:48:57.680 --> 02:48:59.641]  So, I take comfort in that.
[02:49:01.882 --> 02:49:09.065]  But I'll take more comfort if Trump is able to repudiate the false song of globalism.
[02:49:09.245 --> 02:49:11.086]  So let's go now to this clip.
[02:49:11.126 --> 02:49:14.367]  Undercover journalist in full burka has offered Huma Abedin's ballot.
[02:49:14.387 --> 02:49:15.848]  She doesn't even look like Huma Abedin.
[02:49:16.448 --> 02:49:16.628]  But...
[02:49:17.691 --> 02:49:20.492]  That doesn't matter when you're committing voter fraud.
[02:49:21.332 --> 02:49:21.752]  Stay tuned.
[02:49:21.772 --> 02:49:23.733]  We'll be right back to the 52-hour broadcast.
[02:49:24.013 --> 02:49:26.794]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and check out some of our great specials.
[02:49:27.134 --> 02:49:28.995]  Free shipping store-wide.
[02:49:29.675 --> 02:49:30.175]  Roll that tape.
[02:49:42.057 --> 02:49:47.480]  Not only just voter ID because of voting twice, but people can cover their faces.
[02:49:47.580 --> 02:49:48.541]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:49:48.561 --> 02:49:50.522]  Oh, Baselts can do that too.
[02:49:50.582 --> 02:49:51.802]  You know who they are.
[02:50:06.951 --> 02:50:09.212]  Since we don't have your name in the book,
[02:50:29.884 --> 02:50:31.986]  We're good to go.
[02:50:44.881 --> 02:50:50.805]  They threatened to have bombs in public schools, which we're using.
[02:50:50.845 --> 02:50:53.066]  They could disrupt the whole election.
[02:50:53.186 --> 02:50:56.128]  Yeah, but they could do it by wearing a burqa.
[02:50:56.168 --> 02:51:02.512]  But then no one could say, oh, let me see your ID, because they don't have ID, because they don't want to discriminate because they're wearing a burqa.
[02:51:02.552 --> 02:51:08.556]  But then people say, oh, it's so wrong, you can't do that, because you're going to offend them.
[02:51:08.596 --> 02:51:13.879]  But then it's like, hey now, I'm not a Muslim, but I could go in there and, you know.
[02:51:14.059 --> 02:51:14.840]  So, your name is not in the book.
[02:51:14.860 --> 02:51:15.940]  The combination is not in the book.
[02:51:16.661 --> 02:51:18.122]  But that doesn't mean you can't do it.
[02:51:18.142 --> 02:51:18.762]  You can't do it.
[02:51:18.822 --> 02:51:19.643]  You can't do it.
[02:51:19.663 --> 02:51:20.263]  You can't do it.
[02:51:20.283 --> 02:51:20.823]  You can't do it.
[02:51:20.884 --> 02:51:21.364]  You can't do it.
[02:51:21.384 --> 02:51:21.864]  You can't do it.
[02:51:21.884 --> 02:51:22.224]  You can't do it.
[02:51:22.264 --> 02:51:22.845]  You can't do it.
[02:51:22.885 --> 02:51:23.245]  You can't do it.
[02:51:23.265 --> 02:51:23.765]  You can't do it.
[02:51:23.805 --> 02:51:24.326]  You can't do it.
[02:51:24.366 --> 02:51:24.826]  You can't do it.
[02:51:24.846 --> 02:51:25.186]  You can't do it.
[02:51:25.206 --> 02:51:25.527]  You can't do it.
[02:51:25.547 --> 02:51:26.227]  You can't do it.
[02:51:26.247 --> 02:51:26.767]  You can't do it.
[02:51:26.807 --> 02:51:27.148]  You can't do it.
[02:51:27.188 --> 02:51:27.768]  You can't do it.
[02:51:27.788 --> 02:51:28.268]  You can't do it.
[02:51:28.348 --> 02:51:28.929]  You can't do it.
[02:51:28.949 --> 02:51:29.309]  You can't do it.
[02:51:29.329 --> 02:51:29.970]  You can't do it.
[02:51:30.110 --> 02:51:30.770]  You can't do it.
[02:51:30.790 --> 02:51:31.350]  You can't do it.
[02:51:31.451 --> 02:51:31.851]  You can't do it.
[02:51:31.871 --> 02:51:32.211]  You can't do it.
[02:51:32.271 --> 02:51:32.651]  You can't do it.
[02:51:32.671 --> 02:51:33.232]  You can't do it.
[02:51:33.252 --> 02:51:33.832]  You can't do it.
[02:51:33.852 --> 02:51:34.192]  You can't do it.
[02:51:34.212 --> 02:51:34.553]  You can't do it.
[02:51:34.573 --> 02:51:34.913]  You can't do it.
[02:51:34.933 --> 02:51:35.213]  You can't
[02:51:35.573 --> 02:51:39.557]  Your vote isn't really counting because...
[02:51:52.847 --> 02:51:59.090]  You don't know if they're a voter.
[02:51:59.170 --> 02:52:11.696]  Your vote gets discounted because they come in with a burqa on it and they can vote.
[02:52:11.736 --> 02:52:19.400]  People think, you know, it's a liberal thing to do, but I take my vote seriously.
[02:52:27.025 --> 02:52:36.113]  The other candidates, they did not even register to vote.
[02:52:49.813 --> 02:52:50.353]  There you go.
[02:52:50.433 --> 02:52:52.434]  Walk in with a burka, you get a ballot.
[02:52:53.015 --> 02:52:55.616]  Ballotsforburkas.com.
[02:52:55.816 --> 02:52:59.638]  I could walk around with a burka and probably vote ten times for Trump today, I think.
[02:52:59.878 --> 02:53:06.581]  Hey, by the way, Owen Schroer, who went for a massive six hours, he's still up drinking, what are you drinking there?
[02:53:07.922 --> 02:53:08.262]  Energy.
[02:53:08.682 --> 02:53:09.322]  High energy.
[02:53:09.602 --> 02:53:10.623]  Highball energy.
[02:53:10.683 --> 02:53:14.165]  And actually, not to correct you, sir, but it was actually seven and a half.
[02:53:14.705 --> 02:53:14.905]  Yeah.
[02:53:15.851 --> 02:53:16.631]  You would correct me.
[02:53:17.412 --> 02:53:18.513]  But I went home and I changed.
[02:53:18.553 --> 02:53:19.653]  I got my red on now, see?
[02:53:19.673 --> 02:53:21.775]  Because it's election day.
[02:53:22.075 --> 02:53:23.075]  That's what I need to put on.
[02:53:23.256 --> 02:53:25.497]  Wear red to support the election.
[02:53:26.137 --> 02:53:27.838]  Here's a picture on his Twitter.
[02:53:28.379 --> 02:53:31.741]  All I do is, oh and here's some, is that showing up on our website?
[02:53:31.761 --> 02:53:35.183]  Yeah, so that's a school in St.
[02:53:35.223 --> 02:53:36.704]  Charles, Missouri area.
[02:53:36.924 --> 02:53:38.985]  A very conservative area, typically.
[02:53:39.225 --> 02:53:40.246]  It usually goes red.
[02:53:41.186 --> 02:53:42.387]  There's another long line.
[02:53:42.947 --> 02:53:43.487]  Where was that?
[02:53:43.567 --> 02:53:47.249]  O'Fallon, another conservative area that usually goes red.
[02:53:47.530 --> 02:53:48.470]  These are both out of St.
[02:53:48.490 --> 02:53:48.830]  Louis.
[02:53:48.850 --> 02:53:50.671]  There's another line.
[02:53:51.632 --> 02:53:52.672]  Weber Road.
[02:53:53.273 --> 02:53:54.694]  That could go either way, if I remember correctly.
[02:53:54.714 --> 02:53:56.454]  I think that's in North County, St.
[02:53:56.475 --> 02:53:56.695]  Louis.
[02:53:56.735 --> 02:53:58.616]  Normally goes red, but that could go either way.
[02:53:59.696 --> 02:54:02.158]  P-C-B-C in Trees.
[02:54:02.378 --> 02:54:03.719]  That's not in Missouri.
[02:54:03.759 --> 02:54:04.599]  I don't know where that is.
[02:54:04.619 --> 02:54:05.840]  That's another long line.
[02:54:07.778 --> 02:54:08.818]  Another long one.
[02:54:08.838 --> 02:54:14.903]  I had family members texting me, Rob, they were saying how they went to vote early and they were all saying it's long.
[02:54:15.123 --> 02:54:15.404]  Yeah.
[02:54:15.964 --> 02:54:16.865]  Check this out though.
[02:54:18.586 --> 02:54:21.428]  Here's what Hillary voters left at Independence Hall last night.
[02:54:21.448 --> 02:54:23.110]  That beautiful lawn there.
[02:54:23.270 --> 02:54:24.271]  They care about the earth.
[02:54:24.371 --> 02:54:24.751]  Yeah.
[02:54:26.452 --> 02:54:29.114]  Stop global warming, but we're going to trash the entire place.
[02:54:29.235 --> 02:54:29.555]  Right.
[02:54:30.055 --> 02:54:30.576]  Look at this.
[02:54:31.116 --> 02:54:31.737]  This is it.
[02:54:32.537 --> 02:54:33.078]  Nice people.
[02:54:34.005 --> 02:54:35.906]  That was Jack Posobiec sent that out.
[02:54:35.926 --> 02:54:37.066]  You interviewed him last night.
[02:54:37.086 --> 02:54:38.506]  Yeah, I love talking to Jack.
[02:54:38.546 --> 02:54:40.067]  He's very, he's very informed.
[02:54:40.107 --> 02:54:45.128]  He knows a lot about what's going on right now with the polls as far as the actual real-time voters.
[02:54:45.368 --> 02:54:48.329]  And he's thinking it's going to be big Trump win.
[02:54:49.869 --> 02:54:50.369]  I think so.
[02:54:51.170 --> 02:54:52.370]  I should sit up a little bit.
[02:54:53.470 --> 02:54:55.031]  Paul Joseph Watson just tweeted this out.
[02:54:55.371 --> 02:55:00.112]  Impartial Hillary observer tweets support, or impartial election observer tweets support for Hillary.
[02:55:00.192 --> 02:55:00.432]  Ha!
[02:55:00.952 --> 02:55:03.393]  This should give Hillary the final boost she needs.
[02:55:04.653 --> 02:55:05.094]  Amazing.
[02:55:05.114 --> 02:55:10.541]  You know I saw some push notification from Yahoo at like 7 a.m.
[02:55:10.581 --> 02:55:14.367]  It was like the last the last jab for Yahoo against Trump.
[02:55:14.427 --> 02:55:15.809]  They had to get one more jab in.
[02:55:16.752 --> 02:55:17.473]  What did they say?
[02:55:17.693 --> 02:55:18.534]  I forget what it was.
[02:55:18.634 --> 02:55:21.457]  I've, you know, you've seen so many, many of them.
[02:55:22.158 --> 02:55:24.340]  Hey, this is interesting.
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:30.667]  I voted, I voted in a Megyn Kelly poll on Twitter, a presidential poll.
[02:55:31.788 --> 02:55:35.873]  And when I voted, there was just about two and a half thousand people that voted.
[02:55:35.893 --> 02:55:37.474]  It was 68% Trump.
[02:55:37.595 --> 02:55:38.596]  I can't find the poll now.
[02:55:39.297 --> 02:55:39.757]  Oh, well.
[02:55:39.958 --> 02:55:41.621]  You know, Megyn Kelly doesn't want to see that happen.
[02:55:41.801 --> 02:55:42.021]  Right?
[02:55:42.322 --> 02:55:48.012]  And it's funny because I almost quoted the tweet when I saw it and said, this is going to get you in trouble.
[02:55:48.673 --> 02:55:51.057]  And I did it, and I wish I would have because now I can't find it.
[02:55:52.452 --> 02:55:52.812]  Well, there you go.
[02:55:52.852 --> 02:55:53.453]  How do you like that?
[02:55:53.513 --> 02:55:54.653]  Maybe someone can help me find it.
[02:55:54.693 --> 02:55:55.834]  Maybe I'm just sleep deprived.
[02:55:56.194 --> 02:55:58.855]  Well, and you're, speaking of sleep deprived, you're going to go on for an hour.
[02:55:58.875 --> 02:55:59.095]  Tag me in.
[02:55:59.115 --> 02:55:59.956]  You're going to tag out.
[02:55:59.976 --> 02:56:00.576]  Alright.
[02:56:00.836 --> 02:56:01.537]  You're coming in.
[02:56:02.457 --> 02:56:08.580]  We're going to go to our first caller, Charles, and how are we going to do this?
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:09.781]  Do you have your earpiece?
[02:56:09.881 --> 02:56:10.361]  You ready to go?
[02:56:10.461 --> 02:56:10.821]  Coming over.
[02:56:10.981 --> 02:56:11.722]  I'm going to unplug.
[02:56:12.995 --> 02:56:15.017]  We're going to go to Charles and see what he has to say.
[02:56:15.037 --> 02:56:18.520]  This is Rob Dew, actually just going to get up and we're going to switch out in real time.
[02:56:19.301 --> 02:56:20.042]  Keep doing the poll.
[02:56:20.282 --> 02:56:21.663]  I've got the poll results right here.
[02:56:21.704 --> 02:56:23.185]  It looks like Trump's winning 13 to 0.
[02:56:23.385 --> 02:56:24.366]  Oh, live poll?
[02:56:24.446 --> 02:56:24.847]  Live poll.
[02:56:29.380 --> 02:56:35.183]  You're watching the 52 hour live stream on InfoWars.com forward slash show.

[02:56:46.990 --> 02:56:47.810]  That also helps.
[02:56:47.890 --> 02:56:49.251]  Spread the link far and wide.
[02:56:49.711 --> 02:56:50.071]  That'll be nice.
[02:56:50.091 --> 02:56:51.572]  I can finally talk to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:56:51.612 --> 02:56:52.752]  I've been meaning to talk to him.
[02:57:19.460 --> 02:57:23.485]  He skipped out on me during the wiki roll, but maybe we'll talk to him today.
[02:57:23.505 --> 02:57:34.560]  Alright, so we got... Folks, I listened to a little bit of Rob Dew before I came in, and I knew he was doing a poll, but I didn't go to get the results.
[02:57:37.691 --> 02:57:39.592]  Trump has 13.
[02:57:40.412 --> 02:57:41.753]  Clinton has nothing.
[02:57:41.913 --> 02:57:48.857]  Of course, I understand our audience is informed and of course probably not going to get too many Clinton supporters.
[02:57:49.477 --> 02:57:54.940]  I will say this, when I was on my way back up here, I went by a couple bus stops.
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:56.841]  It looked like mostly kids that were heading to school.
[02:57:57.562 --> 02:57:59.563]  One of the bus stops was like 70% red.
[02:58:02.250 --> 02:58:06.492]  Now, I don't know if that's because their school is red or they got an event or something going on, but that was crazy.
[02:58:06.552 --> 02:58:09.494]  I did see a lot of young kids wearing red, and they're the ones that are on social media.
[02:58:10.014 --> 02:58:13.636]  Alright, let's go out to Charles in Ohio first.
[02:58:14.217 --> 02:58:16.458]  Charles, the battleground state of Ohio.
[02:58:17.058 --> 02:58:21.100]  No GOP candidate has ever won the presidential election without Ohio.
[02:58:21.140 --> 02:58:22.241]  Who did you vote for today?
[02:58:22.261 --> 02:58:26.923]  Alright, I think we lost Charles.
[02:58:26.943 --> 02:58:27.764]  Did we lose Charles, guys?
[02:58:32.895 --> 02:58:35.557]  Alright, well I guess he left when Robb Dew took him.
[02:58:35.837 --> 02:58:40.741]  Alright, so let's go to Marion in Baltimore.
[02:58:41.302 --> 02:58:42.363]  Marion, who did you vote for?
[02:58:46.166 --> 02:58:48.788]  Okay, so my screen needs to be refreshed.
[02:58:48.848 --> 02:58:50.809]  I'm having a bit of a Hillary Clinton disorder here.
[02:58:50.849 --> 02:58:55.073]  I'm seeing double and it looks like we're going to get this fixed.
[02:58:55.093 --> 02:58:55.773]  Thank you, Nico.
[02:58:56.574 --> 02:59:00.917]  So, as I said, I voted in this Megyn Kelly poll.
[02:59:02.057 --> 02:59:08.862]  And it was just over two and a half thousand people that voted, and then I went back to check on it, and I couldn't find it.
[02:59:10.984 --> 02:59:14.907]  Now I know I haven't slept in some time, but this seems like a pretty simple one.
[02:59:16.088 --> 02:59:19.210]  If anybody can find that poll, please retweet it at me.
[02:59:20.972 --> 02:59:26.376]  Donald Trump was kicking ass, and I think that's why she may have deleted it, but we'll find out.
[02:59:26.436 --> 02:59:29.559]  Okay, so we've got John in North Carolina.
[02:59:30.540 --> 02:59:31.181]  Go ahead, John.
[02:59:31.201 --> 02:59:32.161]  Who'd you vote for today?
[02:59:33.562 --> 02:59:34.063]  Hey, Owen.
[02:59:34.623 --> 02:59:42.830]  I actually already voted by Donald Trump because he said our country will no longer surrender to the false song of globalism.
[02:59:43.330 --> 02:59:45.071]  You know, and that was such a powerful thing.
[02:59:45.252 --> 02:59:48.574]  And then I think he may have taken it one step further.
[02:59:48.594 --> 02:59:56.781]  I forget the exact quote, but he was basically like, I will not rest until there's actual justice in this country for every American.
[02:59:57.021 --> 02:59:58.022]  I thought that that was powerful.
[02:59:58.042 --> 02:59:58.922]  I forget the exact words.
[02:59:58.962 --> 02:59:59.603]  I'm paraphrasing.
[03:00:00.305 --> 03:00:00.945]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:00:01.605 --> 03:00:06.746]  I would like to add, though, that the Hillary for Prison stickers were a huge hit here in North Carolina.
[03:00:07.146 --> 03:00:11.447]  I was only able to order about 300 of them, but they were all handed out within a day.
[03:00:11.467 --> 03:00:15.128]  I've been volunteering at the polls, handing out sample ballots.
[03:00:15.928 --> 03:00:27.130]  I will say that there were a number of Hillary supporters that showed up, but the majority of folks in my area were taking GOP sample ballots for Donald J. Trump.
[03:00:28.691 --> 03:00:29.851]  Did you see much red out there?
[03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:37.937]  You know, I'm going out there again today at 1, but we have early voting here in North Carolina.
[03:00:38.738 --> 03:00:40.219]  It was varied.
[03:00:40.259 --> 03:00:42.762]  A number of folks were wearing red, but
[03:00:44.352 --> 03:00:45.974]  I wouldn't say that the majority of them were.
[03:00:46.014 --> 03:00:53.362]  I did see plenty of red and when you thought they were going to take your ballot, they just said no thank you or they kept going.
[03:00:53.462 --> 03:00:56.786]  I was out there wearing my Hillary for Prison shirts.
[03:00:56.886 --> 03:00:59.288]  I had some folks saying some pretty nasty things to me.
[03:01:00.249 --> 03:01:04.134]  I just smiled at them and said thanks for coming out to vote.
[03:01:05.655 --> 03:01:12.581]  Got into a couple arguments, of course, but I'd say overall, North Carolina, I'm in a very liberal part of the state.
[03:01:12.842 --> 03:01:14.783]  I think it's going to go red for Trump.
[03:01:17.146 --> 03:01:18.527]  Alright, well that's good news.
[03:01:18.847 --> 03:01:21.189]  Thank you for the call, John, out of North Carolina.
[03:01:22.030 --> 03:01:25.153]  Let's go to another John.
[03:01:25.413 --> 03:01:26.554]  This John in Connecticut.
[03:01:26.594 --> 03:01:27.916]  Go ahead, John, who'd you vote for?
[03:01:28.991 --> 03:01:31.253]  Hello, good afternoon, good morning.
[03:01:31.633 --> 03:01:34.375]  Yes, you betcha, it's Donald Trump all the way.
[03:01:34.395 --> 03:01:36.797]  Oh, 15 and up.
[03:01:37.697 --> 03:01:40.099]  Yeah, and I got a friend who's 46 years old.
[03:01:40.119 --> 03:01:42.601]  He finally got registered and voted for the first time.
[03:01:42.621 --> 03:01:46.964]  I wanted to say that at 7am the polls were very, very busy.
[03:01:47.004 --> 03:01:51.247]  This has to be a record for first time voter turnout.
[03:01:52.392 --> 03:01:58.236]  I don't know what kind of measurable we have, if any of this, for a first-time voter turnout.
[03:01:58.416 --> 03:01:58.657]  I am.
[03:01:58.817 --> 03:02:01.339]  I am a first-time voter right here for Trump.
[03:02:01.579 --> 03:02:02.119]  How do you like that?
[03:02:02.379 --> 03:02:02.579]  Yeah.
[03:02:03.620 --> 03:02:07.923]  God bless you, you know, and God bless America, because we gotta do something different.
[03:02:07.963 --> 03:02:08.664]  She's been around, though.
[03:02:08.684 --> 03:02:09.785]  First-time presidential voter.
[03:02:09.825 --> 03:02:10.665]  I just want to clarify.
[03:02:10.705 --> 03:02:11.986]  First-time presidential voter.
[03:02:12.006 --> 03:02:12.847]  Go ahead.
[03:02:13.647 --> 03:02:15.728]  Well, and I just wanted to say a few things.
[03:02:15.768 --> 03:02:16.868]  The polls were real busy.
[03:02:16.968 --> 03:02:19.468]  A couple people were talking and said, geez, we need a new president.
[03:02:19.488 --> 03:02:20.989]  And I think everybody was being polite.
[03:02:21.029 --> 03:02:24.910]  I turned around, my boss and his wife are behind me, my landlady's behind me.
[03:02:24.930 --> 03:02:30.351]  You know, so lots of neighbors, of course, we all vote in a small area.
[03:02:30.371 --> 03:02:32.931]  We have paper ballots with a special marking pen here.
[03:02:33.671 --> 03:02:37.332]  And they get scanned at the end of the thing and they disappear into a big black box.
[03:02:38.312 --> 03:02:41.413]  So I'm doing the best I can to trust that that works correctly.
[03:02:42.930 --> 03:02:48.455]  Oh, and I wanted to say that, you know, a lot of us sinful warriors, constitutionalist patriots, we have our candidate.
[03:02:48.595 --> 03:02:49.496]  This is our guy.
[03:02:49.696 --> 03:02:59.225]  It's not like in years past where we're settling, or we wish we could have been, or at the third party, or in 2012, I wrote one in, I wrote Alex Jones in there.
[03:03:00.191 --> 03:03:01.272]  You know, this is our guy.
[03:03:01.312 --> 03:03:02.793]  This is who we've been waiting for.
[03:03:02.833 --> 03:03:04.875]  This is, you know, he's our voice.
[03:03:04.915 --> 03:03:06.896]  He found our movement, I think.
[03:03:07.236 --> 03:03:08.517]  Could have had anybody's name.
[03:03:09.018 --> 03:03:15.022]  But he's the guy that's strong enough and has that vision and has that presence and the ability to do this.
[03:03:15.102 --> 03:03:16.503]  And God bless him and his family.
[03:03:16.563 --> 03:03:18.004]  I know it's been a sacrifice.
[03:03:18.505 --> 03:03:19.365]  So we're excited.
[03:03:19.405 --> 03:03:22.828]  We're, you know, cautiously, but very optimistic, I would say.
[03:03:23.325 --> 03:03:27.769]  Well, I'm not sure if there was anyone else that could do it, but he's the one that is doing it.
[03:03:27.829 --> 03:03:43.002]  He is the battering ram against the globalists, literally ramming his head against these people, taking all the slings, all the arrows, all the rocks, everything from the establishment, from the brainwashed masses, from the media.
[03:03:43.783 --> 03:03:44.984]  It's truly an amazing thing.
[03:03:45.024 --> 03:03:52.247]  So Trump now has 15, Hillary Clinton has zero, and this caller mentioned how the polls, the lines are stacked.
[03:03:52.608 --> 03:03:56.650]  Folks, Hillary Clinton has run for office before.
[03:03:56.730 --> 03:03:57.630]  She lost.
[03:03:57.670 --> 03:03:59.631]  She had a failed presidential campaign.
[03:03:59.671 --> 03:04:00.352]  Let's remember this.
[03:04:01.172 --> 03:04:03.194]  These lines are not for Hillary Clinton.
[03:04:03.494 --> 03:04:05.176]  Do not be confused, folks.
[03:04:05.556 --> 03:04:12.642]  There's a reason why in this election cycle we've seen more first-time voters registering to vote than ever before.
[03:04:12.962 --> 03:04:15.444]  There's a reason why these lines are so long.
[03:04:15.885 --> 03:04:18.127]  It's not Hillary Clinton.
[03:04:19.388 --> 03:04:22.771]  Did you see one line outside of a Hillary Clinton event ever?
[03:04:22.791 --> 03:04:22.831]  No.
[03:04:24.597 --> 03:04:24.897]  No.
[03:04:25.238 --> 03:04:38.547]  And the only time you ever saw a packed Hillary Clinton event was when she either paid Jay-Z and Beyonce millions of dollars to perform, or she had Bon Jovi out performing for her, or Lady Gaga.
[03:04:39.048 --> 03:04:40.108]  I couldn't even believe this.
[03:04:40.509 --> 03:04:43.070]  Lady Gaga is actually wearing
[03:04:43.991 --> 03:04:58.580]  A Hitler costume on stage with Hillary, and then doing a Hitler salute, this actually happened, and then afterwards, holding up Hillary Clinton like the victor, and pointing at her like this is your God.
[03:04:59.801 --> 03:05:01.022]  This is who we give you.
[03:05:02.823 --> 03:05:03.944]  This piece of you-know-what.
[03:05:04.872 --> 03:05:05.252]  There she is!
[03:05:05.272 --> 03:05:05.593]  Look at this!
[03:05:05.613 --> 03:05:07.474]  She's wearing a Hitler costume!
[03:05:09.276 --> 03:05:13.739]  Don't try to sit here and tell me that they're not doing this on purpose, folks.
[03:05:13.939 --> 03:05:16.161]  Don't try to sit here and tell me that Lady Gaga
[03:05:17.162 --> 03:05:24.305]  Who goes to spirit cookings where they have naked bodies bathing in like... I don't even know what the hell she's doing, okay?
[03:05:24.405 --> 03:05:37.009]  I really have no idea what she's doing, but she goes to these spirit cookings, she goes to these satanic art rituals, and then she shows up for a Hillary Clinton rally in a Nazi SS uniform.
[03:05:38.189 --> 03:05:41.791]  Okay, I'm sorry, it's not the exact... She doesn't look like a Nazi!
[03:05:47.694 --> 03:05:51.937]  Guys, I'm telling you, there are much better pictures than this if you can find them.
[03:05:52.017 --> 03:05:54.378]  There's one where she's literally doing the Hitler salute.
[03:05:55.279 --> 03:05:57.580]  And then there's another one where she's holding Hillary Clinton.
[03:05:57.820 --> 03:05:59.161]  In fact, I think I retweeted it.
[03:05:59.181 --> 03:06:00.602]  Can you guys pull my Twitter back up?
[03:06:00.722 --> 03:06:02.103]  Or maybe it's up on this computer.
[03:06:03.664 --> 03:06:06.506]  But I think I actually retweeted one of those images.
[03:06:08.956 --> 03:06:10.158]  Alright, we're gonna try to find that.
[03:06:10.278 --> 03:06:11.820]  Let's take another caller.
[03:06:12.421 --> 03:06:16.126]  Let's take Jerry in Washington while we try to find this image.
[03:06:16.647 --> 03:06:17.307]  Go ahead, Jerry.
[03:06:18.678 --> 03:06:26.482]  Yeah, I'm an ex-POW, and I ended up being the precinct captain for the Democratic caucuses here.
[03:06:27.102 --> 03:06:29.844]  We didn't have anybody, as far as I know, in the whole district.
[03:06:29.944 --> 03:06:30.924]  It was for Hillary.
[03:06:30.984 --> 03:06:31.885]  We were all Bernie.
[03:06:31.905 --> 03:06:40.770]  Of course, once it got stolen from Bernie, then we're all vindictive clingers of our guns and Bibles, so I don't know anybody that isn't voting for Trump.
[03:06:43.011 --> 03:06:45.092]  Even in the liberal state of Washington?
[03:06:46.343 --> 03:06:50.047]  Yeah, you know, once you get the fool me once kind of attitude.
[03:06:53.271 --> 03:06:55.173]  And yeah, we didn't like that.
[03:06:55.433 --> 03:06:57.996]  It was just totally, well, we know it was taken.
[03:06:58.056 --> 03:06:58.656]  It was stolen.
[03:07:00.959 --> 03:07:02.100]  Well, that would be huge.
[03:07:03.421 --> 03:07:08.067]  If Trump could pull Washington, that's a blue state pretty much through and through.
[03:07:09.434 --> 03:07:22.506]  I mean, look, if we get a fair result in this election from these black box electronic voting machines, I mean, we might be looking at... I mean, how many states would Hillary actually win?
[03:07:23.607 --> 03:07:25.008]  She would win California.
[03:07:25.368 --> 03:07:27.490]  I think she might win California.
[03:07:27.510 --> 03:07:28.752]  I think she could win New York.
[03:07:29.892 --> 03:07:33.095]  I mean, outside of that, Massachusetts maybe?
[03:07:33.155 --> 03:07:35.117]  I mean, really though, where does she have support?
[03:07:35.197 --> 03:07:36.979]  Where does she have followers?
[03:07:37.019 --> 03:07:38.560]  Where is she popular?
[03:07:38.580 --> 03:07:39.501]  I'm not seeing it anywhere.
[03:07:40.502 --> 03:07:43.986]  Yeah, we have mail-in votes, so that tells you something right there, too.
[03:07:47.049 --> 03:07:48.090]  That's a little sketchy, isn't it?
[03:07:48.971 --> 03:07:54.476]  Yeah, anyway, I happen to see some convoys on I-5 heading south.
[03:07:55.447 --> 03:08:00.812]  And they're all unmarked Humvees with the 50 cal mounts on top, no weapons.
[03:08:01.973 --> 03:08:03.394]  And they're in the hammer lane.
[03:08:03.454 --> 03:08:09.099]  I pulled out with my vehicle, got her up to 70 and it's a little thingy on your mirror goes, you know, beep beep beep.
[03:08:09.760 --> 03:08:14.204]  I look in the mirror and here's the convoy blowing me away, heading south on I-5.
[03:08:14.824 --> 03:08:22.531]  Now we're on an international shipping channel and we've got the, you know, river pilots and the helicopter rescue, Coast Guard, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:08:23.480 --> 03:08:29.486]  And most of the veterans, when they get out, they become first responders, firefighters, police, etc, etc, etc.
[03:08:30.067 --> 03:08:34.411]  So, when they're activated, we're in the community, they know what's going on.
[03:08:35.191 --> 03:08:41.337]  And nobody has mentioned anything about convoys with 50 cal mounts hitting South on I-5.
[03:08:43.479 --> 03:08:46.602]  You know, it's funny, there was a confirmed
[03:08:47.625 --> 03:08:55.549]  I don't know what it was, if it was a shipment or if it just happened to be a truckload or what it was, but UN Trucks, I believe it was in California.
[03:08:56.550 --> 03:08:57.930]  So who the hell knows what's going on?
[03:08:57.970 --> 03:08:59.151]  We know we're occupied.
[03:08:59.171 --> 03:09:03.213]  We'll never know answers to these questions.
[03:09:03.233 --> 03:09:07.055]  We're a long way from Fort Lewis and I can't think of any other major...
[03:09:07.862 --> 03:09:09.602]  Well, we know they're preparing!
[03:09:32.912 --> 03:09:34.253]  They've been preparing for a while.
[03:09:34.373 --> 03:09:35.014]  For everything.
[03:09:35.094 --> 03:09:36.495]  For nuclear.
[03:09:36.515 --> 03:09:37.636]  A blast.
[03:09:38.296 --> 03:09:38.917]  Except for us.
[03:09:38.957 --> 03:09:39.817]  We don't get to prepare.
[03:09:40.078 --> 03:09:41.619]  We don't get emergency food shelters.
[03:09:41.659 --> 03:09:43.280]  We don't get nuclear fallout shelters.
[03:09:43.881 --> 03:09:46.543]  We don't get bunkers full of weapons and food.
[03:09:47.203 --> 03:09:48.044]  We get none of that.
[03:09:48.504 --> 03:09:59.349]  You know, the elite are prepping, they're getting food, they're building bunkers, the government is, you know, they're getting food, they're getting bunkers, they're getting emergency ammunition, they're digging in, they're preparing, but the people are doing nothing.
[03:09:59.689 --> 03:10:05.031]  In Russia, they're warning their people that this could be going on, they're telling their people to get emergency food supplies.
[03:10:05.071 --> 03:10:07.452]  I think this is actually happening in multiple countries now.
[03:10:09.033 --> 03:10:12.674]  You know what though, in all fairness, I'll actually give it to the US government.
[03:10:12.714 --> 03:10:14.235]  FEMA actually runs
[03:10:16.394 --> 03:10:20.815]  Public address announcements on radio stations actually, now that I'm thinking about it.
[03:10:21.455 --> 03:10:23.836]  So I guess, I guess, I mean I guess they're warning you too.
[03:10:24.236 --> 03:10:32.318]  FEMA's published books on how to try to stay safe during nuclear fallout.
[03:10:32.919 --> 03:10:35.039]  So I guess they are warning the people somewhat.
[03:10:36.259 --> 03:10:37.740]  The media's not going to report on it.
[03:10:39.045 --> 03:10:40.005]  So there's that element.
[03:10:40.085 --> 03:10:42.727]  And of course, the general population doesn't care.
[03:10:43.167 --> 03:10:46.408]  But now we've got Trump 16, Clinton still 0.
[03:10:48.449 --> 03:10:52.250]  Let's go to another caller who's been holding the longest here.
[03:10:52.270 --> 03:10:56.712]  It appears it is Mike in New Jersey.
[03:10:56.732 --> 03:10:57.473]  Go ahead, Mike.
[03:10:59.033 --> 03:10:59.914]  Who'd you vote for, Mike?
[03:11:04.956 --> 03:11:05.236]  Hello?
[03:11:05.636 --> 03:11:06.576]  Yeah, who'd you vote for, Mike?
[03:11:08.723 --> 03:11:10.663]  Well, first of all, I voted for Trump.
[03:11:11.003 --> 03:11:12.624]  But let me tell you something about my family.
[03:11:12.704 --> 03:11:15.384]  I come from a lifelong Democratic family.
[03:11:16.004 --> 03:11:20.125]  Very involved with the Democratic Party in New Jersey and so forth and so on.
[03:11:20.765 --> 03:11:25.186]  I have since left the People's Republic of New Jersey because I can't deal with what's going on.
[03:11:25.826 --> 03:11:29.187]  So I cast my vote very early this morning and went to go visit some family.
[03:11:30.027 --> 03:11:33.148]  Not one person in my family
[03:11:34.144 --> 03:11:35.506]  Voting for Hillary Clinton.
[03:11:35.986 --> 03:11:44.015]  Every single one of my register, lifelong Democratic family members flipped at the polls.
[03:11:44.095 --> 03:11:49.722]  And I know this because I had the largest vehicle in the family and I drove them there.
[03:11:49.742 --> 03:11:52.405]  You got a polling convoy.
[03:11:54.228 --> 03:11:55.069]  We absolutely did.
[03:11:55.109 --> 03:12:05.974]  And the talk around the family leading up to this was, we're lifelong Democrats, we've always voted Democrats, we vote Democratic straight tickets, so forth and so on.
[03:12:07.194 --> 03:12:14.498]  As some of my family members were coming out, I was waiting for them, keeping the car warm, and they hopped in and they said, I did it.
[03:12:14.798 --> 03:12:15.658]  I said, what did you do?
[03:12:16.279 --> 03:12:17.579]  They said, well, we flipped at the polls.
[03:12:17.899 --> 03:12:18.840]  I said, get out of here.
[03:12:19.240 --> 03:12:20.861]  I said, no, we flipped at the polls.
[03:12:21.579 --> 03:12:27.742]  And I have never known, these people have never lied to me ever in their lives and I've known them since I was a child.
[03:12:28.282 --> 03:12:36.526]  So I think we're going to see something very interesting happening possibly in certain traditionally blue states.
[03:12:36.926 --> 03:12:39.627]  They might flip and become red states and that would be great.
[03:12:40.285 --> 03:12:40.965]  Well, we'll see.
[03:12:41.065 --> 03:12:42.646]  We'll see how they try to rig these polls.
[03:12:42.706 --> 03:12:47.487]  It really all comes down to the inner-city vote, to be perfectly honest with you, because that's how the Democrats rigged this to begin with.
[03:12:47.907 --> 03:12:51.349]  But it's funny how you mentioned you and your family were lifelong Democrats.
[03:12:51.909 --> 03:12:53.969]  You know, I think what we're... I mean, here's the deal.
[03:12:54.009 --> 03:13:01.492]  Like, you and your family are probably smart people, probably well-researched, and you and I might have different
[03:13:01.772 --> 03:13:02.132]  I don't
[03:13:21.474 --> 03:13:35.307]  Lifelong Democrats who are just Democrats in policy and they don't actually want to be affiliated with the race baiting and the instigating and the lying and cheating and the rigging and all the things the Democrats do.
[03:13:35.347 --> 03:13:41.472]  They just policy-wise agree with that political spectrum, but because these are just
[03:13:42.333 --> 03:13:47.056]  True American citizens who care about this country, of course they're not going to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[03:13:47.076 --> 03:13:55.300]  And it's so amazing, you know, you think about the Democratic Party basically committing suicide in nominating Hillary Clinton, folks.
[03:13:57.101 --> 03:13:58.522]  But of course they had to nominate her.
[03:13:59.082 --> 03:14:03.224]  They've been working on this campaign for how many years now?
[03:14:03.985 --> 03:14:11.549]  With Scott Foval and Bob Kramer and Barack Obama and Aaron Black and Donald Duck?
[03:14:13.844 --> 03:14:16.706]  So they've been working this whole thing for such a long time.
[03:14:16.726 --> 03:14:18.648]  They had no choice.
[03:14:18.708 --> 03:14:20.029]  Bernie Sanders never had a chance.
[03:14:20.609 --> 03:14:27.714]  And the Democratic Party was willing to commit suicide for Hillary Clinton.
[03:14:28.055 --> 03:14:32.738]  In fact, you can add the Democratic Party to the Clinton body count.
[03:14:33.719 --> 03:14:34.879]  Go ahead and chalk that up.
[03:14:34.899 --> 03:14:34.879]  47.
[03:14:35.020 --> 03:14:36.541]  Go ahead and chalk 48.
[03:14:39.298 --> 03:14:41.780]  Hillary Clinton killed the Democratic Party.
[03:14:42.280 --> 03:14:53.309]  I would guarantee you Hillary Clinton killed the Democratic Party because here's the thing, even if she wins, even if she wins, the Democrats will know exactly what happened because they already saw it before!
[03:14:54.349 --> 03:14:56.251]  She already stole it from Bernie Sanders!
[03:14:56.271 --> 03:14:57.992]  They know damn well what happened!
[03:14:58.953 --> 03:15:00.674]  So this isn't going to work for her.
[03:15:01.415 --> 03:15:03.796]  Now I do want to cover a couple things before we take our next caller.
[03:15:03.816 --> 03:15:04.277]  First of all,
[03:15:05.401 --> 03:15:09.602]  Kohler earlier said that Paul Towne was a guy who worked at Comet Pizza.
[03:15:10.042 --> 03:15:11.043]  That's been discredited.
[03:15:11.343 --> 03:15:12.843]  Could not actually confirm that.
[03:15:13.303 --> 03:15:23.006]  But, what we can now confirm, Hillary Clinton is directly affiliated with James Alphantis.
[03:15:23.646 --> 03:15:26.067]  This has been discovered in WikiLeaks.
[03:15:29.367 --> 03:15:30.888]  A dinner for Hillary Clinton
[03:15:32.386 --> 03:15:35.608]  With guest chef James Alphantis.
[03:15:36.729 --> 03:15:37.910]  Now I just got this.
[03:15:38.090 --> 03:15:41.233]  This is a Tony Podesta email it appears to be.
[03:15:42.253 --> 03:15:47.697]  So I'll try to get the crew to actually you know what I retweeted this if you want to go back to my Twitter.
[03:15:48.678 --> 03:15:50.780]  You can just actually see the text of this tweet.
[03:15:52.821 --> 03:15:55.223]  Does this screen control what goes on the screen?
[03:15:55.563 --> 03:15:56.244]  I'm just curious guys.
[03:15:57.714 --> 03:16:00.355]  Okay, so you got the Hitler Gaga up then.
[03:16:01.236 --> 03:16:02.256]  There's the Hitler Gaga.
[03:16:05.298 --> 03:16:06.999]  She's with her.
[03:16:07.619 --> 03:16:08.299]  She's with her.
[03:16:08.380 --> 03:16:09.960]  Yes, there she is, folks.
[03:16:10.561 --> 03:16:11.181]  Hitler Gaga.
[03:16:11.241 --> 03:16:11.741]  Okay, but no.
[03:16:12.702 --> 03:16:13.862]  Back to what I was just saying.
[03:16:14.383 --> 03:16:26.029]  Here you go, in the Podesta emails, a direct affiliation with Hillary Clinton and the operator of Comet Pizzas and Ping Pong, James Alphantis.
[03:16:27.011 --> 03:16:28.152]  I'll pull this up real quick.
[03:16:28.192 --> 03:16:31.153]  By the way, has anyone found that Megyn Kelly poll?
[03:16:31.213 --> 03:16:32.094]  Still haven't found that.
[03:16:32.134 --> 03:16:33.335]  That mysteriously disappeared.
[03:16:34.595 --> 03:16:36.196]  Kind of like some of the people behind the Clintons.
[03:16:37.577 --> 03:16:38.698]  I can't get this thing to pull up.
[03:16:38.718 --> 03:16:39.178]  Here you go.
[03:16:40.539 --> 03:16:41.399]  Tony Podesta.
[03:16:42.580 --> 03:16:47.783]  Same guy who does spirit cookings with Marina Abranovich.
[03:16:48.804 --> 03:16:52.106]  Wanted to flag a dinner I'm doing at my house tomorrow for Hillary.
[03:16:53.450 --> 03:16:55.212]  I wonder if this was another spirit cooking.
[03:16:55.973 --> 03:16:56.894]  It was a pizza party.
[03:16:57.054 --> 03:16:57.875]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:16:58.856 --> 03:17:04.722]  Doing a fundraiser at my house with Brother John on October 6th at my house.
[03:17:05.343 --> 03:17:06.304]  He has to repeat that.
[03:17:06.344 --> 03:17:08.646]  He's not a very smart guy, this Tony Podesta.
[03:17:10.288 --> 03:17:11.309]  But John was there too.
[03:17:11.389 --> 03:17:13.552]  John and I are cooking along with guest chefs.
[03:17:13.712 --> 03:17:15.334]  Guest chefs, can't even spell right.
[03:17:16.365 --> 03:17:17.806]  These people are such goons.
[03:17:19.127 --> 03:17:19.648]  I'll tell ya.
[03:17:20.228 --> 03:17:24.391]  How can these people run this criminal enterprise?
[03:17:24.432 --> 03:17:26.093]  They don't even know how to spell.
[03:17:30.096 --> 03:17:33.379]  But somehow they get away with this because the American population is so brainwashed.
[03:17:33.399 --> 03:17:34.279]  But there you go, folks.
[03:17:34.359 --> 03:17:40.685]  Guest Chef James Alphantis of Comet Ping Pong Pizza and Bucks Camping and Fishing.
[03:17:41.604 --> 03:17:58.851]  I don't know about the Bucks camping and fishing deal, but obviously Comet Ping Pong Pizza is something very sketchy that I was hoping we could get some Info Warriors out there to troll that place just to see if there's any triggering that goes on by your presence there, but I didn't see any evidence of that.
[03:17:59.371 --> 03:18:00.772]  Let's take another caller here.
[03:18:02.783 --> 03:18:06.744]  And let's go to John in New York.
[03:18:07.645 --> 03:18:11.606]  I'm sorry, actually we've got Chris in Illinois has been holding longer.
[03:18:11.626 --> 03:18:18.889]  I think that Trump could have a chance in Illinois depending how the inner city vote in Chicago goes.
[03:18:19.009 --> 03:18:29.112]  If they're not excited to get out for Hillary in the city of Chicago, which I don't see why they would be, then Hillary will not win Illinois and that could be a death blow to the Democrats.
[03:18:29.152 --> 03:18:29.472]  Go ahead.
[03:18:32.193 --> 03:18:32.613]  Hello!
[03:18:33.533 --> 03:18:34.114]  How are you doing?
[03:18:34.134 --> 03:18:35.454]  Doing alright.
[03:18:36.755 --> 03:18:37.735]  Who'd you vote for today?
[03:18:38.695 --> 03:18:39.536]  I voted for Trump.
[03:18:40.096 --> 03:18:40.396]  Hmm.
[03:18:41.816 --> 03:18:44.938]  Okay, I am a registered Democrat.
[03:18:45.238 --> 03:18:46.018]  My whole family is.
[03:18:46.338 --> 03:18:48.159]  I'm a lot like your last caller.
[03:18:50.920 --> 03:18:52.020]  I've been working really hard.
[03:18:52.120 --> 03:18:54.061]  Talked to thousands of people here in Illinois.
[03:18:54.688 --> 03:18:55.108]  Literally.
[03:18:55.789 --> 03:18:59.232]  And I'm telling you right now, Illinois is going to be a red state.
[03:18:59.432 --> 03:19:01.394]  That's just the way it's going to be.
[03:19:01.474 --> 03:19:04.456]  What did you think about my synopsis of the last caller?
[03:19:06.838 --> 03:19:08.500]  You're pretty much right on.
[03:19:10.982 --> 03:19:15.406]  Honestly, I like the fact that you realize that, you know, even though we're Democrats,
[03:19:18.860 --> 03:19:20.861]  You know, we didn't vote Democrat this time.
[03:19:21.341 --> 03:19:24.923]  In fact, it was me and my two sons got in the truck first thing this morning.
[03:19:24.943 --> 03:19:26.864]  We were at the polling office when they unlocked the door.
[03:19:27.424 --> 03:19:27.764]  Okay?
[03:19:28.804 --> 03:19:29.505]  Was there a line?
[03:19:31.025 --> 03:19:32.366]  Nope, just us three.
[03:19:34.167 --> 03:19:36.928]  What part of Illinois do you live in?
[03:19:37.808 --> 03:19:39.009]  We live in central Illinois.
[03:19:39.389 --> 03:19:41.750]  Like Decatur, Mount Zion, Macon?
[03:19:42.671 --> 03:19:43.951]  Around Peoria.
[03:19:44.411 --> 03:19:44.711]  Okay.
[03:19:45.592 --> 03:19:47.052]  That's typically a conservative area.
[03:19:48.173 --> 03:19:48.293]  Yep.
[03:19:50.781 --> 03:19:55.266]  But the deal is, and it's not just here, I travel around the whole state.
[03:19:55.446 --> 03:19:59.631]  And like I said, I've talked to literally thousands of people.
[03:19:59.651 --> 03:20:02.014]  Illinois is going to be a red state.
[03:20:03.035 --> 03:20:04.056]  That's huge.
[03:20:04.076 --> 03:20:04.817]  What is Illinois?
[03:20:05.197 --> 03:20:06.399]  How many electoral votes?
[03:20:06.419 --> 03:20:07.080]  Like 21 or something?
[03:20:08.957 --> 03:20:10.459]  20?
[03:20:08.997 --> 03:20:10.459]  Yeah, that's big.
[03:20:10.779 --> 03:20:15.305]  And if he gets Pennsylvania too, which it looks like it might be a landslide, Pennsylvania is one of the worst.
[03:20:16.226 --> 03:20:26.219]  In Pennsylvania, every county except Pittsburgh and Philadelphia are the only places in Pennsylvania that go blue.
[03:20:26.259 --> 03:20:27.220]  Maybe one other city.
[03:20:27.240 --> 03:20:27.541]  Go ahead.
[03:20:28.530 --> 03:20:28.730]  Right.
[03:20:29.150 --> 03:20:44.877]  Well, you know, I think a lot of the people in Illinois, and what I understand is, when she was paying all those people to go up there to Illinois to Trump's deal, paying $1,500 to interrupt, and we put some of our Illinois residents in the hospital.
[03:20:45.338 --> 03:20:47.098]  I mean, they tried to dupe us.
[03:20:47.318 --> 03:20:48.779]  Police officers too, right?
[03:20:49.539 --> 03:20:49.820]  Yeah.
[03:20:50.060 --> 03:20:51.000]  And that's what I'm talking about.
[03:20:51.020 --> 03:20:51.540]  That is sick.
[03:20:51.560 --> 03:20:52.301]  They tried to dupe us.
[03:20:52.341 --> 03:20:53.001]  That is sick.
[03:20:54.001 --> 03:20:54.322]  I know.
[03:20:54.822 --> 03:20:57.223]  They tried to dupe us to think that we're stupid.
[03:20:58.260 --> 03:21:02.249]  And, you know, we're not very forgiving people here in Illinois.
[03:21:02.269 --> 03:21:04.013]  I don't know if you know that, but we're not.
[03:21:04.670 --> 03:21:09.151]  No, actually, most of my family resides in Illinois now.
[03:21:09.191 --> 03:21:10.572]  That's where both my parents grew up.
[03:21:10.732 --> 03:21:12.352]  That's how I'm so familiar with the area.
[03:21:14.012 --> 03:21:20.954]  But it's, you know, it's funny because even like my family is kind of split in Illinois, you know, liberal, conservative.
[03:21:21.034 --> 03:21:25.995]  But it's funny because in Illinois, it's a weird dynamic where everyone's just kind of central.
[03:21:26.355 --> 03:21:26.976]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:21:26.996 --> 03:21:27.956]  There's no real like
[03:21:28.436 --> 03:21:33.399]  Like, the extreme left is kind of rare, except in downtown Chicago, and the extreme right is kind of rare.
[03:21:33.439 --> 03:21:37.741]  It's just kind of like, just, like, old-fashioned, like, Midwestern Americans.
[03:21:37.781 --> 03:21:41.704]  There's still a lot of farmers out there, you know, especially in central Illinois.
[03:21:41.724 --> 03:21:42.844]  Yep.
[03:21:43.605 --> 03:21:45.366]  And that's where we're coming from.
[03:21:46.346 --> 03:21:51.429]  And there was a, before I forget, everybody should try you guys' Patriot Blend coffee.
[03:21:52.230 --> 03:21:52.790]  It's amazing.
[03:21:53.350 --> 03:21:53.751]  Literally.
[03:21:54.491 --> 03:21:56.312]  Yeah, I had, it kept me up, it kept me up.
[03:21:56.352 --> 03:21:57.473]  I saw I'm still up, actually.
[03:22:00.063 --> 03:22:04.345]  But I wanted to throw that in there before we got off, because some people don't like to try new coffee.
[03:22:04.846 --> 03:22:13.910]  But if you're like a high-end coffee drinker, like Hills Brothers or something, I would actually say it's at that level.
[03:22:14.451 --> 03:22:15.411]  It's pretty good coffee.
[03:22:17.172 --> 03:22:18.273]  Well, thank you.
[03:22:18.773 --> 03:22:19.973]  Thank you for that plug.
[03:22:20.054 --> 03:22:22.575]  Infowarsstore.com, Patriot Blend Coffee.
[03:22:23.803 --> 03:22:25.523]  Yeah, it's good stuff.
[03:22:25.543 --> 03:22:27.624]  And I did find the Megyn Kelly poll.
[03:22:27.644 --> 03:22:39.146]  I just want to clarify, I couldn't find it earlier because it was not the official Megyn Kelly, but we do have 8,100 voters and Trump is still at 68%.
[03:22:39.746 --> 03:22:41.026]  I'll go ahead and retweet that.
[03:22:42.287 --> 03:22:44.607]  Go ahead, final comments from Chris in Illinois.
[03:22:46.047 --> 03:22:48.128]  Anyway, just want to let you know that everybody,
[03:22:49.107 --> 03:22:53.189]  I'm telling you, everybody here in Illinois, we're really pulling for Trump.
[03:22:53.229 --> 03:23:03.294]  Everybody that I've talked to, except for a very small few, and most of the small few aren't even going to go to the polls because they don't want to vote for either candidate.
[03:23:03.474 --> 03:23:03.734]  Yeah.
[03:23:04.234 --> 03:23:05.275]  Yeah, and that's the thing too.
[03:23:05.355 --> 03:23:12.158]  I think this is going to come down to voter turnout because, again,
[03:23:14.468 --> 03:23:16.089]  I don't care what a poll says.
[03:23:16.609 --> 03:23:24.333]  I don't care what an internet poll says, because if you're not going to get off your ass and vote, it doesn't matter.
[03:23:25.974 --> 03:23:28.495]  And these people don't go to the Hillary rallies.
[03:23:28.755 --> 03:23:29.816]  Why would they go vote?
[03:23:30.176 --> 03:23:32.017]  Especially when they see the long line.
[03:23:33.058 --> 03:23:42.722]  Do you think a Hillary supporter, who's so lazy, he or she can't even do enough research, excuse me, not to slight women, there are a lot of educated women out there voting Trump.
[03:23:45.612 --> 03:23:54.634]  That they're going to be so lazy that they don't do enough research to see how Hillary Clinton is crooked Hillary, then they're not going to be, they're not going to do enough to get up and vote for her.
[03:23:54.654 --> 03:23:56.114]  They're too lazy, they can't even do the research.
[03:23:56.134 --> 03:23:56.895]  They're not going to vote.
[03:23:57.315 --> 03:23:58.815]  This is going to come down to voter turnout.
[03:23:59.935 --> 03:24:00.375]  Exactly.
[03:24:00.415 --> 03:24:04.956]  And not only that, are they going to go stand with a blue shirt in the middle of a line with a thousand people?
[03:24:04.976 --> 03:24:06.417]  Oh my god, a line?
[03:24:06.437 --> 03:24:07.637]  Heck no!
[03:24:08.637 --> 03:24:08.997]  Exactly.
[03:24:09.057 --> 03:24:10.258]  Ain't nobody got time for that!
[03:24:11.618 --> 03:24:12.118]  Exactly.
[03:24:14.369 --> 03:24:16.009]  Alright Chris, well thank you for the call.
[03:24:16.069 --> 03:24:16.870]  Another Trump voter.
[03:24:16.910 --> 03:24:18.590]  We got 18 to nothing so far.
[03:24:18.970 --> 03:24:21.251]  And we're having Democrats call in.
[03:24:22.511 --> 03:24:24.031]  Democrats are calling in for Donald Trump.
[03:24:24.051 --> 03:24:31.833]  You know, speaking to Chris, who is from Illinois, talking a little geopolitics in the state of Illinois.
[03:24:33.214 --> 03:24:35.714]  I remember, I guess it was Christmas.
[03:24:35.754 --> 03:24:36.454]  It was Christmas.
[03:24:36.654 --> 03:24:39.035]  I was with my family in Illinois.
[03:24:39.095 --> 03:24:40.275]  Some may be tuned in right now.
[03:24:40.315 --> 03:24:41.095]  I'm sure you remember.
[03:24:41.135 --> 03:24:43.016]  We were up until 4 in the morning shouting.
[03:24:44.540 --> 03:24:54.689]  And I remember being laughed at by just about every member of my family, except two, that I thought Trump was going to win.
[03:24:54.769 --> 03:24:57.272]  First of all, they couldn't even believe I supported Trump, but that's fine.
[03:24:57.312 --> 03:24:57.612]  They know.
[03:24:57.632 --> 03:24:58.813]  They think I'm crazy, whatever.
[03:24:58.873 --> 03:24:59.834]  Okay, he supports Trump.
[03:25:00.194 --> 03:25:01.756]  Oh, but you actually think he's going to win?
[03:25:01.776 --> 03:25:02.817]  Oh, no.
[03:25:03.557 --> 03:25:04.438]  You are out of your mind.
[03:25:04.458 --> 03:25:06.000]  And I said, you wait and see.
[03:25:06.840 --> 03:25:08.021]  You wait and see.
[03:25:08.041 --> 03:25:09.242]  You're going to be eaten crow.
[03:25:09.763 --> 03:25:10.484]  And even though
[03:25:11.164 --> 03:25:14.808]  I have my doubts because I know what they'll do to Riggett.
[03:25:14.968 --> 03:25:17.411]  I know they're already planning on giving this to Hillary.
[03:25:17.551 --> 03:25:18.732]  It's been the plan the whole time.
[03:25:18.773 --> 03:25:20.334]  But maybe this was just their hubris.
[03:25:20.715 --> 03:25:23.358]  Maybe this was just their arrogance and ignorance.
[03:25:23.458 --> 03:25:24.819]  They're completely out of touch with reality.
[03:25:25.822 --> 03:25:28.283]  And that's why they thought they could steal this, but I don't know.
[03:25:28.624 --> 03:25:30.405]  Maybe the callers can talk about this too.
[03:25:30.445 --> 03:25:31.645]  Maybe you guys back there.
[03:25:31.665 --> 03:25:34.227]  I mean, I feel great.
[03:25:35.047 --> 03:25:41.150]  I feel like, I mean, I don't know why, I feel like there's really something going on right now for Trump.
[03:25:41.391 --> 03:25:42.871]  Actually, I'm going to ask Nico and Matt.
[03:25:42.891 --> 03:25:47.354]  When you guys woke up this morning, did you feel negative energy or positive energy?
[03:25:48.283 --> 03:25:50.246]  Actually, Nico and Matt went to get more coffee.
[03:25:50.286 --> 03:25:50.947]  Is that CJ?
[03:25:50.967 --> 03:25:51.608]  This is CJ.
[03:25:51.948 --> 03:25:53.130]  Oh, see, that's what happened.
[03:25:53.550 --> 03:25:54.932]  They heard the Patriot Blend.
[03:25:55.132 --> 03:25:56.294]  They heard the plug, folks.
[03:25:56.995 --> 03:25:59.098]  Infowarsstore.com, Patriot Blend coffee.
[03:25:59.118 --> 03:25:59.578]  That's what happened.
[03:25:59.598 --> 03:26:00.239]  They had to get coffee.
[03:26:00.259 --> 03:26:01.441]  So now CJ is running the board.
[03:26:01.721 --> 03:26:05.105]  CJ, when you woke up this morning, did you feel positive or negative energy?
[03:26:05.765 --> 03:26:06.526]  I felt positive.
[03:26:07.066 --> 03:26:13.493]  I think whoever wins, we've, as a nation, woken up to the level of corruption.
[03:26:13.533 --> 03:26:14.494]  We want to make a change.
[03:26:15.195 --> 03:26:24.745]  There's going to be more people involved in the political process and hopefully on the grassroots level as well as moving to the national level to actually get our voices heard and make a difference.
[03:26:25.523 --> 03:26:32.888]  Yeah, that's a great point that just Donald Trump running and doing everything he's done has created so much more interest in politics.
[03:26:33.228 --> 03:26:37.331]  It's gotten so many people to get off their duffs and go vote.
[03:26:37.391 --> 03:26:37.871]  That's amazing.
[03:26:37.911 --> 03:26:44.656]  Not only record turnout in early voting, but we're going to have record turnout on election day.
[03:26:45.396 --> 03:26:48.018]  So we got record turnout all across the board.
[03:26:48.038 --> 03:26:48.759]  What about Zach?
[03:26:48.819 --> 03:26:49.579]  Let's ask Zach.
[03:26:49.959 --> 03:26:53.682]  Zach, when you woke up this morning, did you feel positive or negative energy?
[03:26:55.618 --> 03:26:57.159]  I felt positive energy today.
[03:26:57.179 --> 03:26:59.180]  It was an interesting day today.
[03:26:59.200 --> 03:27:00.780]  I don't know.
[03:27:01.821 --> 03:27:03.842]  I don't know.
[03:27:05.082 --> 03:27:05.863]  But no negative.
[03:27:05.883 --> 03:27:12.926]  See, I feel like if Hillary Clinton was going to win today, I just feel like the spirit and the energy of the universe would just be crushing me right now.
[03:27:13.046 --> 03:27:13.326]  I don't know.
[03:27:13.346 --> 03:27:15.727]  Maybe I'm just so sleep deprived I don't even know what I'm talking about.
[03:27:17.091 --> 03:27:20.734]  No, I feel like it would be a little bit more depressing.
[03:27:20.774 --> 03:27:24.537]  I know it is kind of gloomy outside, but... And it still feels good!
[03:27:24.577 --> 03:27:25.738]  Yeah, the energy's nice here.
[03:27:27.819 --> 03:27:31.602]  Alright, let's take another caller who has been only the longest here.
[03:27:31.622 --> 03:27:34.725]  It looks like John in New York.
[03:27:35.285 --> 03:27:39.368]  Boy, if Trump won New York... Go ahead, John.
[03:27:40.509 --> 03:27:41.310]  Who'd you vote for, John?
[03:27:41.350 --> 03:27:41.930]  Who'd you vote for?
[03:27:43.011 --> 03:27:45.093]  Oh, we vote for Trump all the way here in New York.
[03:27:46.856 --> 03:27:47.097]  19-0.
[03:27:47.117 --> 03:27:48.599]  19-0 Trump.
[03:27:48.619 --> 03:27:49.260]  Go ahead John.
[03:27:50.742 --> 03:27:58.595]  I just want to tell you guys I was a Bernie Sanders supporter for the longest time and then they stole the election from him and you know we just didn't know what to do.
[03:27:58.635 --> 03:27:59.717]  We didn't know who to vote for.
[03:28:00.493 --> 03:28:02.855]  And I saw this video online just the other day.
[03:28:02.935 --> 03:28:04.677]  It's called Burned by Bernie.
[03:28:04.897 --> 03:28:08.200]  And if you go on YouTube and search it, you gotta see this thing.
[03:28:08.220 --> 03:28:09.321]  Burned by Bernie.
[03:28:09.761 --> 03:28:10.482]  Burned by Bernie.
[03:28:10.502 --> 03:28:16.227]  If you look up this video, I guarantee, if you play this video, Bernie supporters are going to be crossing over.
[03:28:17.007 --> 03:28:18.989]  They're going to be jumping aboard the Trump train.
[03:28:19.430 --> 03:28:20.370]  I'm telling you right now.
[03:28:20.390 --> 03:28:21.671]  You guys want to pull that up?
[03:28:23.922 --> 03:28:24.743]  Alright, we'll find that video.
[03:28:24.763 --> 03:28:25.383]  We'll pull that up.
[03:28:25.443 --> 03:28:26.384]  Thank you for the call.
[03:28:26.524 --> 03:28:27.044]  That's good.
[03:28:27.124 --> 03:28:27.564]  That's good.
[03:28:27.584 --> 03:28:28.565]  This is election day.
[03:28:28.605 --> 03:28:31.387]  This is our final chance to try to sway voters.
[03:28:31.407 --> 03:28:32.928]  You gotta see the video to believe it.
[03:28:32.988 --> 03:28:34.689]  It's got a picture of Bernie Sanders.
[03:28:34.729 --> 03:28:38.091]  He's holding up two signs that say, Don't Vote Hillary.
[03:28:38.192 --> 03:28:39.472]  And it's got a song to it.
[03:28:39.893 --> 03:28:44.376]  And it exposes the corruption in the DNC that a lot of us didn't know about.
[03:28:44.396 --> 03:28:45.977]  It's something that y'all need to see.
[03:28:46.906 --> 03:28:50.809]  Well, I wish he would be more outspoken about it, to be perfectly honest with you.
[03:28:50.869 --> 03:28:55.292]  I feel like he kind of... You know, it would be like... There it is, right there.
[03:28:55.312 --> 03:29:05.040]  This would be like if... Imagine, with everything that Trump has done, he loses this election and then just disappears to some lake house.
[03:29:05.680 --> 03:29:11.685]  I mean, what do you think about Bernie's actions post-Hillary nomination?
[03:29:12.819 --> 03:29:20.845]  It's just like Trump, actions speak louder than words, and what Bernie's been doing is just a terrible, terrible, terrible thing to do to the movement.
[03:29:21.866 --> 03:29:23.747]  Yeah, I mean, he just completely abandoned it.
[03:29:23.767 --> 03:29:27.430]  Did you feel like he ended up being a fraud, or do you still support him as a politician?
[03:29:28.831 --> 03:29:30.372]  I do not stand by him at all.
[03:29:31.873 --> 03:29:32.093]  Wow.
[03:29:32.753 --> 03:29:34.735]  And do you think New York could go to Trump?
[03:29:36.096 --> 03:29:36.936]  I certainly do.
[03:29:37.397 --> 03:29:37.657]  Wow.
[03:29:39.558 --> 03:29:41.280]  I mean, folks, let me just say,
[03:29:42.555 --> 03:29:55.786]  If we had a landslide like this, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, you want to talk about a middle finger to the establishment.
[03:29:56.467 --> 03:29:57.047]  That is it.
[03:29:59.489 --> 03:30:03.413]  I think that this video helped the Bernie Sanders supporters come across the line.
[03:30:03.453 --> 03:30:04.013]  I really do.
[03:30:04.273 --> 03:30:06.555]  If you could share that video, you may just help Trump.
[03:30:07.216 --> 03:30:08.397]  Today is the day.
[03:30:09.827 --> 03:30:11.489]  Especially out there in New York, folks.
[03:30:11.529 --> 03:30:17.714]  Share that video, especially if you are in New York, where we know that there are some Bernie supporters.
[03:30:18.115 --> 03:30:20.817]  Hey, let's go to a caller in Nova Scotia.
[03:30:23.695 --> 03:30:28.137]  There was some ditzy celebrity that said she was going to move to Nova Scotia if Trump wins.
[03:30:28.477 --> 03:30:29.878]  I forget who that was.
[03:30:30.618 --> 03:30:32.519]  I'll trade her spots then.
[03:30:33.160 --> 03:30:36.801]  Who would you vote for?
[03:30:36.861 --> 03:30:41.104]  I'll give 86 votes for Trump please.
[03:30:41.524 --> 03:30:42.364]  I'll send them to Obama.
[03:30:45.646 --> 03:30:49.487]  Uh, if you just walk across the border and, uh, claim you're anyone.
[03:30:49.547 --> 03:30:49.887]  I don't care.
[03:30:49.927 --> 03:30:51.047]  Claim you're Michael Jordan.
[03:30:51.547 --> 03:30:52.027]  You can vote.
[03:30:52.127 --> 03:30:53.068]  I went to Orlando.
[03:30:53.148 --> 03:30:55.608]  I went to Disney, so I've contributed, right?
[03:30:55.648 --> 03:30:57.128]  I've had vacations in Arizona.
[03:30:57.889 --> 03:31:00.349]  I've contributed, so I therefore get some vote action.
[03:31:00.749 --> 03:31:02.750]  Well, Obama says if you vote, you're a citizen.
[03:31:02.970 --> 03:31:06.110]  So all you gotta do... See, it's so... It's amazing, you know?
[03:31:06.130 --> 03:31:08.411]  There's supposed to be this whole process to become a citizen.
[03:31:08.471 --> 03:31:09.491]  Oh my God, Obama.
[03:31:10.231 --> 03:31:11.311]  If I vote, I'm a citizen.
[03:31:11.351 --> 03:31:12.112]  So here's all you gotta do.
[03:31:12.472 --> 03:31:13.312]  Come here and vote.
[03:31:14.474 --> 03:31:20.618]  And then, you know, try to do things like a normal citizen, get a driver's license, whatever, buy a house, you know, get a job, everything.
[03:31:20.998 --> 03:31:28.884]  And then when they say, wait, you know, you're not a citizen, you need to go through this process, say, well, no, but Obama said, if I voted and I voted, here's my ballot, I voted, I'm a citizen, right?
[03:31:29.324 --> 03:31:31.005]  No, no, Obama's a jackass.
[03:31:31.105 --> 03:31:31.426]  Go ahead.
[03:31:32.506 --> 03:31:32.927]  Big time.
[03:31:33.007 --> 03:31:35.708]  No, I mean, you know, Trump's a godsend.
[03:31:35.749 --> 03:31:42.073]  You know, he's going against a pretty heavy-duty machine that obviously everybody knows is incorporated everywhere.
[03:31:44.406 --> 03:31:49.787]  I think the big thing is, you know, plan A, if he wins it outright, you know, these guys have a lot to lose.
[03:31:49.847 --> 03:31:54.989]  And I think, as everybody knows, it could be something scary, God knows what.
[03:31:56.389 --> 03:32:03.811]  But I mean, plan B is obviously, if he loses, it's a fight from the inside out of NYPD and FBI people.
[03:32:05.271 --> 03:32:07.792]  I think, you know, it's pretty historic times, obviously.
[03:32:08.533 --> 03:32:15.838]  For Canadians, you know, obviously, my family, in fact, came through, came from Missouri, came, get free land in Canada back in 1900.
[03:32:15.918 --> 03:32:21.282]  And, you know, my roots stretch into the United States and back into, you know, 1600s.
[03:32:21.322 --> 03:32:26.565]  And, you know, I pray, pray for Donald Trump to free, free the average man and woman.
[03:32:26.585 --> 03:32:31.849]  All right, well, thank you for the call from Nova Scotia.
[03:32:31.929 --> 03:32:33.690]  You got anything else you want to say before we let you go?
[03:32:33.710 --> 03:32:35.531]  No, go Trump.
[03:32:35.551 --> 03:32:36.632]  Just everybody get out and vote.
[03:32:38.095 --> 03:32:39.316]  Alright, well thank you for the call.
[03:32:39.396 --> 03:32:40.636]  Good job.
[03:32:41.277 --> 03:32:43.798]  Hey, I've got an interactive map.
[03:32:43.818 --> 03:32:45.398]  Let's pull this map up here, guys.
[03:32:45.418 --> 03:32:46.939]  Let's go ahead and pull that map up.
[03:32:47.519 --> 03:32:48.000]  Hmm.
[03:32:49.520 --> 03:32:55.363]  So, I think that the results I have tabulated here are very, very possible.
[03:32:56.163 --> 03:33:00.645]  In fact, if I was predicting, this is how I actually would think it would go.
[03:33:01.205 --> 03:33:04.267]  In fact, I think that you could even reasonably, maybe even do this.
[03:33:04.887 --> 03:33:06.288]  And, you know, I mean, you know.
[03:33:07.503 --> 03:33:09.104]  And then we got callers in Illinois!
[03:33:09.344 --> 03:33:10.125]  We got Illinois!
[03:33:10.265 --> 03:33:11.146]  We got callers in New York!
[03:33:11.346 --> 03:33:12.006]  We got New York!
[03:33:12.167 --> 03:33:14.568]  We got callers in New York!
[03:33:14.648 --> 03:33:15.069]  We got what?
[03:33:15.089 --> 03:33:15.869]  404 for Trump?
[03:33:15.929 --> 03:33:17.711]  No, this is probably not how it's gonna go down.
[03:33:18.351 --> 03:33:29.059]  But, I've done this before, I've looked at almost every scenario, and I just, honestly, I don't see a situation where Trump loses, folks.
[03:33:29.819 --> 03:33:30.680]  I really don't.
[03:33:32.361 --> 03:33:33.582]  So let's go conservative.
[03:33:33.602 --> 03:33:34.843]  Here, let's pull this map back up.
[03:33:34.883 --> 03:33:35.804]  Let's go conservative.
[03:33:37.042 --> 03:33:47.747]  Let's say, I mean, even if she gets Ohio and Minnesota, where else is she going to get on this map?
[03:33:47.767 --> 03:33:48.948]  She's not getting Iowa.
[03:33:49.768 --> 03:33:51.169]  She's not getting Nebraska.
[03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:52.289]  I don't believe that.
[03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:54.310]  Okay, go ahead, take Nebraska.
[03:33:54.350 --> 03:33:54.691]  Have it.
[03:33:55.591 --> 03:33:56.732]  She's still nowhere near.
[03:33:57.252 --> 03:33:57.772]  Where else?
[03:33:57.892 --> 03:33:58.512]  I mean, I'm serious.
[03:33:58.632 --> 03:33:59.013]  I don't know.
[03:33:59.153 --> 03:34:00.613]  Where else can she pull votes from?
[03:34:00.653 --> 03:34:01.534]  New Hampshire, perhaps?
[03:34:02.998 --> 03:34:04.218]  She's not going to get Indiana.
[03:34:04.238 --> 03:34:06.399]  I don't see how she gets Michigan.
[03:34:06.499 --> 03:34:07.420]  Maybe Wisconsin?
[03:34:10.201 --> 03:34:11.441]  I don't think she's getting Florida.
[03:34:12.061 --> 03:34:12.821]  North Carolina?
[03:34:12.861 --> 03:34:13.442]  Heck no.
[03:34:14.382 --> 03:34:17.023]  Sure, she's going to get this area over here in the Washington, D.C.
[03:34:17.083 --> 03:34:17.303]  area.
[03:34:17.343 --> 03:34:19.524]  She's going to get the Northeast up here.
[03:34:19.584 --> 03:34:20.304]  They always go there.
[03:34:20.344 --> 03:34:21.184]  We'll even give her Maine.
[03:34:21.845 --> 03:34:30.848]  I just, I mean, folks, even in a conservative fashion here, it could all come down to Pennsylvania, I suppose.
[03:34:32.210 --> 03:34:34.111]  There's a lot of cemeteries in Pennsylvania.
[03:34:35.192 --> 03:34:36.113]  This is a good point.
[03:34:37.954 --> 03:34:40.135]  Does Pennsylvania have the most cemeteries in the world?
[03:34:40.275 --> 03:34:43.077]  I mean, that could be the most cemeteries in America.
[03:34:43.097 --> 03:34:54.245]  I don't know, honestly, if, if, I mean, either one of these battleground states, if Trump gets one of them,
[03:34:56.280 --> 03:34:57.060]  I think he wins.
[03:34:57.280 --> 03:35:00.301]  And I still think he's going to win Wisconsin and Minnesota.
[03:35:00.581 --> 03:35:01.961]  But I'll give those to Hillary.
[03:35:02.261 --> 03:35:03.501]  I'll give her those.
[03:35:03.521 --> 03:35:04.661]  I'm giving her these over here, too.
[03:35:05.922 --> 03:35:09.142]  I mean, folks, I really don't see how Trump doesn't win this thing.
[03:35:10.142 --> 03:35:14.903]  Other than an outright rig, I really don't see how Trump doesn't win this thing.
[03:35:15.363 --> 03:35:24.765]  And I guess the next question is, how long, I wonder, is this going to take to figure out if this is going on, to figure out what's going on?
[03:35:25.865 --> 03:35:29.846]  I mean, you'd figure if it's electronic voting, you would know in real time, wouldn't you?
[03:35:30.687 --> 03:35:31.707]  So what's up with that?
[03:35:31.727 --> 03:35:34.068]  Because they gotta rig it!
[03:35:34.608 --> 03:35:35.488]  That's what's up with that.
[03:35:35.508 --> 03:35:39.570]  Alright, let's take another call.
[03:35:39.610 --> 03:35:41.370]  And who's been holding the longest here, guys?
[03:35:41.410 --> 03:35:42.071]  Who should we take?
[03:35:42.691 --> 03:35:44.091]  Okay, let's go out to Robert.
[03:35:44.772 --> 03:35:45.512]  Go ahead, Robert.
[03:35:47.472 --> 03:35:50.233]  How you doing?
[03:35:50.674 --> 03:35:51.554]  Who'd you vote for today?
[03:35:52.449 --> 03:35:53.990]  Oh, me and my wife are sitting here.
[03:35:54.050 --> 03:35:57.011]  We weren't going to go vote until we talked to you guys.
[03:35:57.371 --> 03:36:02.313]  I've been trying to get through since 11 yesterday, and I haven't slept.
[03:36:03.573 --> 03:36:04.354]  I hear you, brother.
[03:36:04.374 --> 03:36:05.454]  Neither have I. Go ahead.
[03:36:06.315 --> 03:36:19.560]  Well, on the first night of the DNC, my wife and I made a video and put it on YouTube in real time where Google and YouTube were censoring us.
[03:36:20.911 --> 03:36:43.159]  It was regarding Kathy O'Brien and she has genital mutilation from her time in the MKUltra program and she had a gynecological exam and there was a demon face carved into her clitoris.
[03:36:45.282 --> 03:36:46.403]  And it's on the video.
[03:36:46.523 --> 03:36:46.923]  I'm sorry.
[03:36:46.963 --> 03:36:47.323]  I'm sorry.
[03:36:47.363 --> 03:36:47.684]  I'm sorry.
[03:36:47.724 --> 03:36:48.024]  I'm sorry.
[03:36:48.064 --> 03:36:48.324]  I'm sorry.
[03:36:48.344 --> 03:36:48.804]  I'm sorry.
[03:36:48.844 --> 03:36:49.145]  I can't.
[03:36:49.225 --> 03:36:49.545]  I couldn't.
[03:36:49.605 --> 03:36:50.886]  It was so extreme what you just said.
[03:36:50.946 --> 03:36:51.666]  I'll go ahead.
[03:36:51.706 --> 03:36:52.547]  I'll let you repeat it.
[03:36:53.187 --> 03:36:55.149]  You witnessed what at the DNC?
[03:36:56.429 --> 03:36:56.730]  Okay.
[03:36:58.110 --> 03:37:04.355]  My wife, there's a book that Kathy O'Brien and Mark Phillips wrote together.
[03:37:04.395 --> 03:37:06.196]  It's called Transformation of America.
[03:37:07.316 --> 03:37:11.099]  Every Info Warrior should be reading up on it.
[03:37:11.639 --> 03:37:11.839]  Page 55, 155.
[03:37:14.777 --> 03:37:21.262]  It talks about Hillary Clinton going down on Kathy O'Brien and raping her.
[03:37:22.263 --> 03:37:22.643]  Okay?
[03:37:23.584 --> 03:37:26.786]  And it's an amazing read.
[03:37:26.886 --> 03:37:30.068]  It's always been speculation.
[03:37:30.088 --> 03:37:31.389]  It's always been speculation.
[03:37:31.409 --> 03:37:35.953]  But this video proves... So what does the video have exactly?
[03:37:36.994 --> 03:37:38.134]  Well, the video is...
[03:37:40.968 --> 03:37:44.449]  It's her at a doctor's office getting a gynecological exam.
[03:37:44.629 --> 03:37:45.109]  Hillary?
[03:37:45.950 --> 03:37:46.510]  No, no.
[03:37:46.870 --> 03:37:47.730]  Kathy O'Brien.
[03:37:49.871 --> 03:37:58.333]  And it shows... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but how... I mean, this is all... I don't even... I don't even know if I want to talk about this, to be honest.
[03:37:59.534 --> 03:38:00.774]  How are you seeing this video?
[03:38:00.794 --> 03:38:00.874]  Okay.
[03:38:05.338 --> 03:38:11.900]  We sent it to you guys a couple times actually, and nobody ever got back to us, which that's cool.
[03:38:12.020 --> 03:38:16.582]  I understand you guys are very, very busy, and I respect what you guys are doing.
[03:38:17.082 --> 03:38:21.484]  Literally thousands of calls, thousands of emails in a minute.
[03:38:21.524 --> 03:38:21.924]  Go ahead.
[03:38:22.664 --> 03:38:22.904]  Right.
[03:38:23.624 --> 03:38:27.606]  Well, if you go on YouTube, you can go to my wife's page.
[03:38:28.606 --> 03:38:30.107]  It's mrs.r.w.sanders.
[03:38:35.895 --> 03:38:37.616]  Do you guys have Twitter?
[03:38:37.636 --> 03:38:38.257]  Do you have Twitter?
[03:38:39.037 --> 03:38:40.118]  No, I don't have Twitter.
[03:38:40.138 --> 03:38:41.338]  We don't use cell phones, man.
[03:38:42.539 --> 03:38:43.620]  I'm a combat veteran.
[03:38:43.640 --> 03:38:46.581]  I did two tours in Iraq.
[03:38:47.422 --> 03:38:51.144]  And there was some shady shit going on with that.
[03:38:51.684 --> 03:38:57.507]  There was an underground porn ring in my battalion, but that's while we were deployed.
[03:38:58.008 --> 03:38:59.008]  That's a whole other novel.
[03:39:00.129 --> 03:39:03.451]  But this first night at the DNC,
[03:39:04.338 --> 03:39:05.718]  We made this video.
[03:39:07.079 --> 03:39:14.881]  YouTube was trying to hide videos that are kind of iffy.
[03:39:16.421 --> 03:39:23.763]  If you type in truth to strangers and fiction in the search bar on YouTube, you'll pull this video up.
[03:39:25.463 --> 03:39:25.684]  All right.
[03:39:25.724 --> 03:39:27.004]  Well, we will look into that.
[03:39:27.224 --> 03:39:29.785]  And I mean, that's that's kind of gruesome stuff.
[03:39:29.845 --> 03:39:30.705]  I have no idea.
[03:39:32.853 --> 03:39:36.395]  How anybody would have seen that video, I really don't even want to talk about that.
[03:39:36.415 --> 03:39:38.116]  I hope that's not true.
[03:39:38.136 --> 03:39:44.219]  But you know what, that's just... Yeah.
[03:39:44.939 --> 03:39:48.381]  Hey, let's go back to that graphic you had pulled up, CJ.
[03:39:49.862 --> 03:39:52.143]  Nah, the cemetery graphic.
[03:39:52.323 --> 03:39:52.983]  Do you still have that?
[03:39:53.663 --> 03:39:54.164]  Yeah, stand by.
[03:39:54.964 --> 03:39:59.006]  So, I thought he was kind of joking, but no.
[03:39:59.266 --> 03:40:02.108]  Actually, Pennsylvania is very cemetery rich.
[03:40:03.385 --> 03:40:04.626]  So you know what that means.
[03:40:05.247 --> 03:40:08.470]  Lot of voters for the Democrats out there in Pennsylvania.
[03:40:11.132 --> 03:40:11.433]  So.
[03:40:11.453 --> 03:40:13.034]  Wow.
[03:40:13.955 --> 03:40:17.899]  So they got a lot of options to pull from there in Pennsylvania.
[03:40:21.704 --> 03:40:24.126]  Alright, well they didn't tell me who they voted for.
[03:40:24.286 --> 03:40:31.973]  I'm imagining they're Democrats if they're at the DNC, but I also imagine they don't like Hillary Clinton, given the content of the phone call.
[03:40:32.673 --> 03:40:36.216]  But no confirmation on the vote.
[03:40:36.236 --> 03:40:36.877]  19 to nothing.
[03:40:37.157 --> 03:40:39.119]  Trump is ahead of Clinton.
[03:40:39.619 --> 03:40:43.242]  Hey, I'm curious guys, do you have any mainstream news pulled up in there?
[03:40:43.302 --> 03:40:47.425]  Are they running any stories like, early polls, Clinton winning, or anything like that?
[03:40:47.445 --> 03:40:47.726]  Do you know?
[03:40:50.011 --> 03:40:51.532]  There's nothing as far as exit polls.
[03:40:51.832 --> 03:40:59.619]  I think there's some of the final polls that were either phone or online that still show a four-point edge for Hillary, but that's all we've got.
[03:41:00.379 --> 03:41:01.340]  Oh, magical.
[03:41:02.101 --> 03:41:03.582]  How magical.
[03:41:04.643 --> 03:41:09.787]  Hillary Clinton, the mainstream media waves the wand, and she has a lead.
[03:41:14.003 --> 03:41:19.124]  Ah, Donald Trump has hundreds of thousands of people turn out at his rallies.
[03:41:19.604 --> 03:41:23.125]  Hillary Clinton gets a total of 20,000 through the whole election cycle.
[03:41:23.565 --> 03:41:28.806]  The mainstream media waves their wand, and magically, Hillary Clinton has the lead!
[03:41:28.826 --> 03:41:31.346]  Ooh, it's magic, folks!
[03:41:31.906 --> 03:41:33.987]  It's the magic of the mainstream media!
[03:41:34.527 --> 03:41:35.387]  There she is!
[03:41:35.407 --> 03:41:37.467]  Oh, I know what it was!
[03:41:38.668 --> 03:41:40.348]  It must have been Lady Gaga!
[03:41:42.020 --> 03:41:44.362]  It must have been, what is that?
[03:41:45.883 --> 03:41:47.644]  Oh my gosh, yeah, that's fine.
[03:41:48.044 --> 03:41:49.145]  Hi, I'm Lady Gaga.
[03:41:50.065 --> 03:41:58.210]  I endorse Hillary Clinton and I like eating God knows what that fluid is off of God knows what is in that tub.
[03:41:58.711 --> 03:42:02.973]  And then I also like dressing up like Hitler and doing the Nazi salute.
[03:42:03.093 --> 03:42:04.454]  Hi, I'm Lady Gaga.
[03:42:04.614 --> 03:42:05.095]  I'm with her.
[03:42:06.570 --> 03:42:07.250]  Are you with her?
[03:42:07.370 --> 03:42:07.850]  I'm with her!
[03:42:08.871 --> 03:42:13.152]  I'm with Marina Abramovic that does Satan spirit cookings!
[03:42:14.412 --> 03:42:15.072]  We're with her!
[03:42:15.853 --> 03:42:16.873]  Are you with her, folks?
[03:42:18.213 --> 03:42:20.454]  Who could possibly be with that absolute demon?
[03:42:21.494 --> 03:42:30.997]  Let's go to... Let's go to Jim in Ohio who is reporting he's seeing a lot of red out there.
[03:42:31.037 --> 03:42:32.157]  Go ahead, Jim, who'd you vote for?
[03:42:33.792 --> 03:42:40.376]  Um, I voted for Trump, although I did hear from a friend of mine in California that their grandfather, who's been dead since 87, voted for Clinton.
[03:42:41.456 --> 03:42:42.077]  Well, yeah!
[03:42:42.137 --> 03:42:49.261]  I mean, my, um, my grandma was a lifelong Republican, voted Republican until the day she died, then she voted Democrat.
[03:42:50.121 --> 03:42:51.262]  Yeah, it's amazing how that happened.
[03:42:52.382 --> 03:42:52.703]  Crazy.
[03:42:53.683 --> 03:42:58.085]  But, um, here in Ohio, um, where I went, we, I mean, it was a sea of red.
[03:42:58.386 --> 03:43:02.308]  So are you, did you, did you happen to get any pictures or video of this?
[03:43:03.908 --> 03:43:31.316]  I didn't, um, because, I mean, I live right down the road from it, so I'm planning on going back this afternoon because I am a photographer, but, um, I mean, we use paper ballots, and something that's really important that people need to understand, though, the paper ballots, they have to make sure that there's no marking anywhere in any of their circles, and they have to make sure it's a clean ballot, because if not, they can have their ballot voided, as if it's, like, basically voting for two people.
[03:43:32.099 --> 03:43:33.980]  So people have to be really careful about that.
[03:43:35.440 --> 03:43:39.221]  Yeah, and also make sure that if you do it on a machine, that the machine doesn't switch your vote.
[03:43:40.081 --> 03:43:40.761]  No, absolutely.
[03:43:41.021 --> 03:43:50.424]  And I even went and I suggested to a lot of my friends, I actually on my phone videoed my ballot and my number and everything else.
[03:43:50.444 --> 03:43:53.385]  So that way, you know, I have proof of exactly how I voted.
[03:43:55.566 --> 03:43:58.826]  But I mean, we're a largely Republican town.
[03:43:59.287 --> 03:44:00.787]  It's a big farming community.
[03:44:01.565 --> 03:44:04.546]  And most of our, like, our sheriff and things like that are all Republican.
[03:44:05.426 --> 03:44:08.307]  But I still don't trust the Clintons as far as I can throw her.
[03:44:09.907 --> 03:44:14.169]  But the biggest thing I, you know, people were talking about the things that Donald Trump has said.
[03:44:14.989 --> 03:44:23.211]  But what they failed to pay attention to is exactly how she spoke to the families of the Benghazi victims.
[03:44:23.391 --> 03:44:24.312]  Lied to them.
[03:44:24.792 --> 03:44:25.412]  Yeah.
[03:44:25.552 --> 03:44:26.852]  She lied to them.
[03:44:26.892 --> 03:44:28.693]  Family members died and she lied.
[03:44:29.571 --> 03:44:38.075]  Right, and then when they were on television and saying what she told them, and she basically like on national TV is calling them liars.
[03:44:38.095 --> 03:44:47.000]  And then when she gets called out on it, she arrogantly, she arrogantly, like, I don't even know how to properly describe how she belts it.
[03:44:47.500 --> 03:44:48.881]  What difference does it make?
[03:44:48.901 --> 03:44:50.682]  Well, I mean, just right.
[03:44:52.983 --> 03:44:54.164]  And see, another thing is, too,
[03:44:55.410 --> 03:44:58.553]  You know, they talk about the actions speak louder than words.
[03:44:58.913 --> 03:45:00.835]  Thirty years of Clinton?
[03:45:00.895 --> 03:45:10.283]  Those actions, I mean, even if, you know, we're willing to look at the murder tally for them, but their actions, especially Hillary's, absolutely speak volumes.
[03:45:10.680 --> 03:45:11.721]  This is such a joke.
[03:45:12.041 --> 03:45:12.782]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[03:45:12.802 --> 03:45:13.162]  Go ahead.
[03:45:13.222 --> 03:45:13.562]  Go ahead.
[03:45:13.722 --> 03:45:14.923]  No, you're okay.
[03:45:15.163 --> 03:45:22.509]  She also made comments in one of her rallies about Donald Trump, you know, spoke this about women and he was trying to hide this and that.
[03:45:23.170 --> 03:45:31.716]  But again, people are not understanding what Hillary has done to all of the accusers that Bill raised.
[03:45:32.056 --> 03:45:34.298]  She stole China from the White House.
[03:45:34.919 --> 03:45:36.059]  What the hell is that?
[03:45:36.200 --> 03:45:37.421]  I mean, what in the hell?
[03:45:38.321 --> 03:45:40.523]  And also, look at all the things they destroyed.
[03:45:41.300 --> 03:45:43.981]  I mean, there's all kinds of things they did just as they were leaving.
[03:45:44.722 --> 03:45:46.943]  And, you know, somebody brought up a good point.
[03:45:47.583 --> 03:45:57.727]  I don't know if it was Trump or who it was, but the way he treated, like, you know, the people they had there working for him, like Monica Lewinsky issue.
[03:45:58.488 --> 03:46:03.070]  Do we really want that going back into the White House for these other young women to have to endure?
[03:46:03.090 --> 03:46:07.572]  I mean, people already say what a bitch Hillary is, and that's including her own Secret Service.
[03:46:08.428 --> 03:46:09.129]  Well, here's the thing.
[03:46:09.209 --> 03:46:11.911]  Of course, of course, that's exactly it.
[03:46:11.971 --> 03:46:13.732]  That is exactly it, Jim.
[03:46:14.092 --> 03:46:15.093]  Of course we don't want that.
[03:46:15.213 --> 03:46:16.314]  Nobody wants that.
[03:46:16.694 --> 03:46:18.155]  So what did they have to do?
[03:46:18.575 --> 03:46:20.637]  They had to rig the primary for Bernie.
[03:46:21.017 --> 03:46:21.698]  We caught them.
[03:46:22.258 --> 03:46:23.399]  They colluded with the media.
[03:46:24.219 --> 03:46:27.202]  Then, colluding with the media again, what do you know?
[03:46:27.602 --> 03:46:29.263]  They're trying to rig the election.
[03:46:29.603 --> 03:46:33.946]  Of course nobody wants a foul-mouthed witch who hates everybody.
[03:46:34.787 --> 03:46:38.193]  I mean, look, it's honestly like Alex says, folks.
[03:46:38.233 --> 03:46:40.416]  I mean, she really just wants to piss on everything.
[03:46:40.476 --> 03:46:46.125]  She really just wants to arrogantly... I'm sorry, I'm not going to get graphic here, folks.
[03:46:46.186 --> 03:46:47.367]  Okay, you know what I'm talking about.
[03:46:48.308 --> 03:46:49.609]  And of course nobody wants this.
[03:46:49.809 --> 03:46:50.709]  So what do they do?
[03:46:51.350 --> 03:47:04.058]  They try to rake Donald Trump through the mud, through the muck, through the garbage, through the sewage, through the excrement, the entire election cycle, to try to make him look so bad!
[03:47:04.938 --> 03:47:18.371]  To try to make him look so appalling that even the wretched pig witch that we have running on the other side, that everybody knows what she is, that they would still rather have that than Donald Trump.
[03:47:18.471 --> 03:47:19.572]  That was the plan.
[03:47:19.912 --> 03:47:20.933]  That was the goal.
[03:47:21.354 --> 03:47:22.815]  They thought that was going to work.
[03:47:22.875 --> 03:47:24.036]  They were so confident.
[03:47:24.276 --> 03:47:25.578]  Hillary was so entitled.
[03:47:25.598 --> 03:47:26.639]  There's so much hubris.
[03:47:26.659 --> 03:47:27.359]  I mean, folks,
[03:47:28.200 --> 03:47:29.841]  Who knows the crimes they're getting away with?
[03:47:29.901 --> 03:47:30.862]  Okay, I'll leave it right there.
[03:47:31.262 --> 03:47:34.564]  Who knows the crap that these people are getting away with?
[03:47:34.704 --> 03:47:36.165]  We can make assumptions.
[03:47:36.425 --> 03:47:42.189]  So if they think and have gotten away with that, why wouldn't they think they can get away with this?
[03:47:42.309 --> 03:47:43.629]  They've been doing it for years!
[03:47:43.829 --> 03:47:45.350]  They got away with 9-11!
[03:47:45.691 --> 03:47:47.652]  Of course they can get away with stealing the election!
[03:47:47.672 --> 03:47:49.053]  Oh, but you know what?
[03:47:50.299 --> 03:47:51.861]  They had a mismeasurement, didn't they?
[03:47:52.421 --> 03:47:55.144]  They had a mismeasurement in the American people, see?
[03:47:55.445 --> 03:47:57.247]  They underestimated you, didn't they?
[03:47:57.667 --> 03:47:58.068]  They did.
[03:47:58.869 --> 03:47:59.669]  And what happened?
[03:48:00.731 --> 03:48:02.653]  You didn't buy it.
[03:48:03.874 --> 03:48:06.417]  You beat the propaganda.
[03:48:07.278 --> 03:48:11.583]  You broke free of the matrix, of the brainwashing.
[03:48:12.765 --> 03:48:18.879]  And so now they're faced with their plan B, which is to steal it for Hillary Clinton.
[03:48:19.280 --> 03:48:20.102]  Oh, but you know what?
[03:48:20.664 --> 03:48:22.688]  They mismeasured again, didn't they?
[03:48:23.814 --> 03:48:31.541]  They mismeasured again because the first time they underestimated the American people, they thought they could trick you with their propaganda and their brainwashing.
[03:48:33.162 --> 03:48:34.103]  Oh, well, you know what?
[03:48:34.503 --> 03:48:36.205]  We'll just go ahead and rig the election.
[03:48:36.245 --> 03:48:37.586]  We've got the voting machines.
[03:48:37.606 --> 03:48:38.887]  We've got the fractional magic.
[03:48:38.967 --> 03:48:40.469]  We can shave points in this deal.
[03:48:40.489 --> 03:48:41.509]  We'll still get it for Hillary.
[03:48:41.930 --> 03:48:42.710]  Oh, but guess what?
[03:48:42.751 --> 03:48:44.172]  You mismeasured again, didn't you?
[03:48:44.332 --> 03:48:47.335]  It's a frickin' landslide for Donald Trump, folks.
[03:48:48.055 --> 03:48:49.395]  It is a landslide.
[03:48:49.756 --> 03:48:52.996]  Jim in Ohio calls in, tells me there's a sea of red at the polls.
[03:48:53.237 --> 03:48:55.137]  People in New York think New York should go to Trump.
[03:48:55.317 --> 03:48:57.358]  People in Washington think Washington should go to Trump.
[03:48:57.838 --> 03:49:01.559]  I don't see how Hillary Clinton wins this election without stealing it.
[03:49:02.439 --> 03:49:03.519]  I really don't.
[03:49:03.619 --> 03:49:06.000]  And again, I ask the callers, I ask everyone back there.
[03:49:06.820 --> 03:49:08.481]  Well, I didn't actually wake up this morning.
[03:49:09.481 --> 03:49:12.203]  I've just been alive, but I'm feeling high energy.
[03:49:12.603 --> 03:49:16.305]  People who have been texting me, who are listening, saying, I woke up feeling high energy.
[03:49:16.346 --> 03:49:20.668]  The staff, even though it's gloomy here in Austin, rainy, cloudy, we feel high energy.
[03:49:20.708 --> 03:49:22.690]  We feel the Trump energy moving.
[03:49:22.990 --> 03:49:25.031]  We feel the country coming back.
[03:49:25.071 --> 03:49:26.672]  We feel the people awakening.
[03:49:27.392 --> 03:49:28.333]  This is amazing.
[03:49:28.353 --> 03:49:33.837]  I mean, this is, I mean, we are talking about a day potentially here, folks.
[03:49:35.148 --> 03:49:37.529]  That will go down in world history.
[03:49:38.490 --> 03:49:40.871]  November 8th, 2016.
[03:49:42.732 --> 03:49:47.415]  This is almost the second shot heard around the world, except in a different fashion.
[03:49:47.435 --> 03:49:51.957]  This time, we shot back at them.
[03:49:54.499 --> 03:49:59.101]  Because they've been playing silent weapons for quiet wars.
[03:50:00.282 --> 03:50:01.683]  And they thought they could get away with it.
[03:50:03.871 --> 03:50:24.605]  But if we defeat the propaganda, if we defeat the machine, if we defeat the criminal Clinton family, that will be the shot heard around the world for citizens around the world, people who work in governments around the world, that the time to move is now.
[03:50:25.326 --> 03:50:28.128]  We are taking out corruption now.
[03:50:30.349 --> 03:50:33.031]  Citizens of planet Earth are no longer asleep.
[03:50:35.393 --> 03:50:37.154]  At least, not all of them.
[03:50:38.014 --> 03:50:42.236]  They're no longer docile, and they're ready to take their future back, folks.
[03:50:42.276 --> 03:50:46.178]  They can see how great the future can be, except they got one thing.
[03:50:46.938 --> 03:50:49.380]  They got a corrupt establishment in their way.
[03:50:49.440 --> 03:50:51.160]  And we got a long way to go, folks.
[03:50:51.301 --> 03:50:53.422]  Donald Trump is not our savior, okay?
[03:50:54.362 --> 03:50:56.623]  But this is the shot heard around the world.
[03:50:56.843 --> 03:51:00.525]  This is completely bucking the establishment.
[03:51:01.792 --> 03:51:09.035]  And actually having someone in the White House that cares about America instead of their own personal well-being.
[03:51:09.055 --> 03:51:12.376]  So I'm going to take one more call before I hand it over to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:51:13.136 --> 03:51:17.598]  Let's go to Mary who is calling in from Minnesota.
[03:51:18.198 --> 03:51:20.399]  Mary, who did you vote for today?
[03:51:20.419 --> 03:51:23.600]  Donald Trump, I believe!
[03:51:23.620 --> 03:51:25.521]  21 for Trump, 0 for Clinton.
[03:51:25.561 --> 03:51:25.981]  Go ahead.
[03:51:27.081 --> 03:51:29.382]  I just want to say that
[03:51:30.376 --> 03:51:41.688]  Greater Minnesota has been under the radar for the Santanic stuff and rituals within our law enforcement for many years.
[03:51:42.944 --> 03:51:47.067]  Nobody has ever been able to prove it or find where they do their things.
[03:51:48.728 --> 03:51:51.190]  They're selected, you know, like everything else.
[03:51:51.210 --> 03:51:52.591]  They're selected down the line.
[03:51:53.371 --> 03:51:55.092]  The good policemen, they have bullets.
[03:51:55.833 --> 03:51:58.615]  They have targets on their backs, like you all say, which is true.
[03:51:58.675 --> 03:51:59.615]  You know, I'm 57.
[03:51:59.655 --> 03:52:05.839]  My husband, I can't say no more about my personal things because that's how bad Brainerd has become.
[03:52:06.880 --> 03:52:12.784]  You know, when they started desensitizing our children with drugs and all this Hollywood crap and the policemen
[03:52:12.824 --> 03:52:13.464]  Hold on, Mary.
[03:52:13.504 --> 03:52:14.404]  Hold on, Mary.
[03:52:14.484 --> 03:52:14.984]  Slow down.
[03:52:15.004 --> 03:52:15.845]  Slow down.
[03:52:15.865 --> 03:52:16.485]  Slow down.
[03:52:16.645 --> 03:52:17.385]  I know, right?
[03:52:42.489 --> 03:52:43.089]  Slow down.
[03:52:43.349 --> 03:52:45.110]  Okay, I want to ask you a question.
[03:52:45.150 --> 03:52:45.910]  You're on fire.
[03:52:46.030 --> 03:52:46.790]  You're on fire.
[03:52:47.550 --> 03:52:49.651]  Do you think Minnesota could go red today?
[03:52:50.471 --> 03:52:51.271]  Not red.
[03:52:51.391 --> 03:52:53.192]  God has his hands on Trump, man.
[03:52:53.292 --> 03:52:53.912]  I'm telling you.
[03:52:53.932 --> 03:53:02.634]  And you put up a pic of George Bush and Obama side by side, and you don't tell me that you can't see the resemblance in them men.
[03:53:03.634 --> 03:53:05.214]  It is unphenomenal!
[03:53:05.294 --> 03:53:06.395]  And I've had six kids.
[03:53:06.955 --> 03:53:07.895]  I've had six kids.
[03:53:07.935 --> 03:53:08.695]  What's your first name?
[03:53:10.616 --> 03:53:11.236]  Are you asking me?
[03:53:12.048 --> 03:53:12.268]  Yeah.
[03:53:13.129 --> 03:53:15.772]  Owen, Owen Schroer here, InfoWarsLive right now.
[03:53:16.132 --> 03:53:17.774]  I've been listening to you for two weeks, okay?
[03:53:17.794 --> 03:53:19.075]  So you all watch this, okay?
[03:53:19.135 --> 03:53:24.620]  If you go all the way back to the killing fields, you know what I'm talking about there, don't ya?
[03:53:24.740 --> 03:53:25.121]  The what?
[03:53:25.181 --> 03:53:25.781]  I'm sorry, the what?
[03:53:26.322 --> 03:53:27.163]  The killing fields.
[03:53:28.240 --> 03:53:37.988]  It's the 48-hour 2020 specials that they gave about the killing fields and all these men and children, women, mostly women, children, young boys, the killing field.
[03:53:38.068 --> 03:53:39.289]  It's all over the television.
[03:53:39.309 --> 03:53:41.010]  You know, it's been a documentary forever.
[03:53:41.070 --> 03:53:46.034]  They've been trying to do the DNAs on these people and skeletons that they can't get no DNA off of.
[03:53:46.334 --> 03:53:49.397]  You don't think this all stems back to their killing sprees?
[03:53:50.257 --> 03:53:51.598]  Oh, well, you know, what is his name?
[03:53:51.858 --> 03:53:52.538]  Ron Brown?
[03:53:52.558 --> 03:53:55.859]  The guy that died on the airplane crash but had a bullet wound in his head?
[03:53:55.879 --> 03:53:58.460]  And then it shows up in the WikiLeaks emails.
[03:53:58.900 --> 03:54:01.681]  The people within the DNC are emailing each other.
[03:54:01.701 --> 03:54:03.141]  Oh, did you know Hillary Clinton?
[03:54:03.581 --> 03:54:04.022]  The Clintons?
[03:54:04.042 --> 03:54:04.822]  Vince Foster?
[03:54:04.842 --> 03:54:05.922]  Did you know about Ron Brown?
[03:54:05.942 --> 03:54:07.243]  I mean, it's like, what is going on?
[03:54:07.283 --> 03:54:08.223]  Thank you for the call, Mary.
[03:54:08.443 --> 03:54:09.603]  You're absolutely on fire.
[03:54:09.924 --> 03:54:11.544]  Alright, it's time for Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:54:11.584 --> 03:54:12.244]  Is he ready to go?
[03:54:14.525 --> 03:54:16.266]  Can I bring on Paul Joseph Watson right now?
[03:54:16.306 --> 03:54:17.046]  I want to hand it off to him.
[03:54:19.932 --> 03:54:24.875]  All right, well I just want to say, Paul Joseph Watson, I salute you from overseas here in America.
[03:54:25.315 --> 03:54:26.396]  Have a great hour, sir.
[03:54:26.976 --> 03:54:28.157]  And thanks to all the callers.
[03:54:28.177 --> 03:54:30.338]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com, folks.
[03:54:30.358 --> 03:54:31.739]  That's how you support this broadcast.
[03:54:31.779 --> 03:54:33.059]  That's how we can go live for 52 hours.
[03:54:33.119 --> 03:54:37.762]  We're going to take a break now, but the 52-hour broadcast rolls on November 8, 2016.
[03:54:38.603 --> 03:54:40.584]  Will this be a day that lives on forever?
[03:54:44.861 --> 03:54:48.962]  And it's Paul Joseph Watson back with the InfoWars marathon election stream.
[03:54:49.522 --> 03:54:58.565]  In today too now, and obviously today is the big day, coming up in one hour will be Alex Jones with the live radio show, with the live TV show.
[03:54:59.045 --> 03:55:00.466]  That comes along in one hour.
[03:55:00.806 --> 03:55:04.647]  But what do we see so far from early indications this morning?
[03:55:04.687 --> 03:55:06.408]  Well, if you're a Donald Trump supporter,
[03:55:07.068 --> 03:55:08.990]  Things aren't looking too bad right now.
[03:55:09.030 --> 03:55:10.030]  We've got this article.
[03:55:11.091 --> 03:55:13.853]  Impartial election observer tweets support for Hillary.
[03:55:13.874 --> 03:55:16.275]  This is the top story up on Infowars.com.
[03:55:16.315 --> 03:55:19.758]  We're going to get on to that in a minute because that is the concern here.
[03:55:19.798 --> 03:55:21.079]  We're talking about vote fraud.
[03:55:21.099 --> 03:55:29.066]  We're talking about the people tasked with being impartial election observers caught engaged in outright bias.
[03:55:29.106 --> 03:55:31.648]  We've got stories about intimidation.
[03:55:32.168 --> 03:55:36.873]  From Black Lives Matter supporters, which of course we've seen from Black Panthers in the past.
[03:55:36.893 --> 03:55:37.734]  We're going to get onto that.
[03:55:38.114 --> 03:55:39.776]  But again, early indications are good.
[03:55:39.796 --> 03:55:45.901]  They had a Fox News diner poll where they just go out to diners and talk to people in Florida.
[03:55:46.422 --> 03:55:51.467]  Basically 20 to 1, the people in that diner said they were voting for Donald Trump.
[03:55:51.867 --> 03:55:56.171]  This is in Florida, a supposedly closely contested swing state.
[03:55:56.992 --> 03:56:02.657]  Again, the pictures coming out show, as we expected, whether the weather's good or bad, huge enthusiasm.
[03:56:02.997 --> 03:56:06.580]  You had people lining up around the block before 7am.
[03:56:08.735 --> 03:56:10.215]  Now is that just Hispanics?
[03:56:10.255 --> 03:56:12.356]  We know there are more Hispanics voting this year.
[03:56:12.936 --> 03:56:16.837]  It can't be black people, it can't be millennials, because those numbers are down.
[03:56:16.877 --> 03:56:23.039]  But enthusiasm as of this early stage looks to be exactly in line with what we predicted.
[03:56:23.399 --> 03:56:26.019]  People lining up round the block before 7am.
[03:56:26.500 --> 03:56:27.600]  These polls are packed.
[03:56:28.442 --> 03:56:29.282]  You had CNN.
[03:56:29.922 --> 03:56:37.924]  Even CNN, the Clinton News Network, reporting at a Virginia polling site that the turnout lines were bigger than in 2008.
[03:56:38.604 --> 03:56:45.545]  That's 2008, not 2012, when of course we had the supposed change candidate, Barack Obama.
[03:56:46.166 --> 03:56:48.786]  CNN saying that lines are bigger than 2008.
[03:56:49.806 --> 03:56:54.487]  Voters in Michigan are tweeting about how they're having a huge turnout.
[03:56:55.127 --> 03:56:57.488]  A lot of people wearing red.
[03:56:58.297 --> 03:57:02.220]  Again, good early indications if you're a Donald Trump supporter.
[03:57:03.081 --> 03:57:06.684]  We've got Trump taking an early lead in these tiny New Hampshire towns.
[03:57:06.764 --> 03:57:09.606]  Is this an indication of how New Hampshire is set to go?
[03:57:09.666 --> 03:57:10.266]  This is out of AP.
[03:57:12.042 --> 03:57:22.550]  Donald Trump is off to a very early lead in the 2016 presidential election, winning over the voters of three New Hampshire precincts by a 32 to 25 margin over Hillary Clinton.
[03:57:23.090 --> 03:57:25.832]  Again, what did the polls show beforehand in New Hampshire?
[03:57:26.292 --> 03:57:28.274]  Plus three, plus four Clinton.
[03:57:28.994 --> 03:57:32.077]  Trump thought that it was winnable, that's why he was there recently.
[03:57:32.737 --> 03:57:35.478]  Now from the early indications again, good for Trump.
[03:57:35.958 --> 03:57:44.360]  Polls in the tiny New Hampshire towns of Dixville, Harts Location and Millsfield opened just after midnight Tuesday and closed as soon as everyone had voted.
[03:57:44.540 --> 03:57:47.961]  Again, this is a tiny sample, but could it be an indication?
[03:57:48.501 --> 03:57:51.882]  These die-hard voters are proud to have the first word on the big vote.
[03:57:52.563 --> 03:57:59.384]  Clinton won more votes in Dixville and Harts Location, but Trump was the overwhelming favourite in Millsfield with a 16-4 edge.
[03:58:02.048 --> 03:58:03.769]  Now this is important about Millsfield.
[03:58:03.809 --> 03:58:05.109]  Again, this is a tiny sample.
[03:58:05.149 --> 03:58:07.370]  You can't extrapolate it out into anything.
[03:58:07.810 --> 03:58:11.671]  But could it show a sense of the sentiment there in New Hampshire?
[03:58:12.091 --> 03:58:23.154]  Given that, in Millsville, where Trump crushed Clinton 16-4, in the primary, Trump lost 8-3 against Ted Cruz.
[03:58:23.794 --> 03:58:28.336]  So he was easily defeated by Cruz in Millsville, yet he's crushing Hillary Clinton.
[03:58:29.156 --> 03:58:30.097]  What does that tell you?
[03:58:30.137 --> 03:58:34.740]  Well, it tells you that this whole Never Trump narrative looks like it's completely failed.
[03:58:35.221 --> 03:58:42.106]  They voted for Cruz over Trump in the primaries, now they're overwhelmingly backing Donald Trump.
[03:58:43.167 --> 03:58:55.097]  Despite this whole Never Trump rhetoric, where you've got establishment neocons, Republicans saying they're going to actually vote for Hillary Clinton, that narrative doesn't seem to be taking hold in New Hampshire.
[03:58:56.212 --> 03:59:04.818]  So again, 16 to 4 edge in Millsfield, overall Donald Trump in this early voting has a 32 to 25 edge over Hillary Clinton.
[03:59:04.858 --> 03:59:16.205]  Again, tiny sample, doesn't really mean anything, but it could give you an indication of the sentiment there on the ground, given the other anecdotal evidence that we're seeing so far.
[03:59:16.765 --> 03:59:22.029]  Huge enthusiasm, huge lines, huge numbers of people wearing red.
[03:59:23.430 --> 03:59:29.633]  Again, we don't know much at this early stage, but the signs are definitely positive if you're a Donald Trump supporter.
[03:59:31.053 --> 03:59:34.455]  We also have polls, final polls by LA Times.
[03:59:34.475 --> 03:59:37.376]  The LA Times poll came out, had Trump ahead plus three.
[03:59:37.716 --> 03:59:46.199]  The IBD poll, which again for basically the entire race has been plus Hillary Clinton, again ended with Donald Trump ahead.
[03:59:47.360 --> 03:59:50.681]  Trump holds two-point lead over Clinton as election day arrives.
[03:59:50.761 --> 03:59:51.982]  This is the final poll.
[03:59:52.918 --> 04:00:06.092]  Republican Donald Trump held on to a two-point lead over his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, 45% to 43% in a four-way match-up according to the final IBD-TIPP presidential tracking poll.
[04:00:06.973 --> 04:00:11.598]  So again, for most of the race, Clinton has been ahead in that poll.
[04:00:12.038 --> 04:00:14.401]  Again, oversampling Democrats.
[04:00:15.438 --> 04:00:17.399]  This is an issue we've talked about over and over again.
[04:00:17.439 --> 04:00:20.340]  They oversampled Democrats for every single poll.
[04:00:21.100 --> 04:00:32.285]  Yet even in this poll, where Trump ended 2% ahead, it was based on weighted results of 361 Democrats and 333 Republicans.
[04:00:33.005 --> 04:00:39.988]  So again, despite the fact they sampled significantly more Democrats, Trump still ended up 2% ahead.
[04:00:41.268 --> 04:00:42.589]  Now you can look at Congress again.
[04:00:43.820 --> 04:00:47.821]  Democrats, somewhat optimistic, maybe they had a chance of overturning that.
[04:00:47.942 --> 04:00:50.302]  Now they've basically abandoned any hope of that.
[04:00:50.362 --> 04:00:51.423]  This is out of Reuters.
[04:00:52.003 --> 04:00:54.224]  As voters head to the polls in Tuesday's U.S.
[04:00:54.244 --> 04:00:58.886]  election, hopes have dampened amongst Democrats that they will make major gains in the U.S.
[04:00:58.926 --> 04:01:02.187]  Congress, even if their nominee, Hillary Clinton, wins the presidency.
[04:01:02.927 --> 04:01:14.342]  Enough wind may have come out of Clinton's sails to slow the Democrats and House of Representatives headway because of the FBI's announcement last month that reignited the controversy about her email practices.
[04:01:15.203 --> 04:01:20.550]  So basically, it's come out the Democrats have given up on their House, given up making any gains on that.
[04:01:21.701 --> 04:01:26.924]  Hillary Clinton, as we reported yesterday, cancelled her fireworks celebration in New York.
[04:01:27.625 --> 04:01:38.031]  Doesn't seem to be a hell of a lot of enthusiasm, given what we've seen over the past, what, three or four weeks, with them saying, oh, this is basically finished, you might as well not even turn up to vote today.
[04:01:39.092 --> 04:01:43.474]  That enthusiasm has kind of dampened over the past week, hasn't it?
[04:01:43.514 --> 04:01:47.397]  And we're seeing that in the news headlines, also in the final tracking polls.
[04:01:48.697 --> 04:01:51.179]  But we got this top story up on InfoWars.com right now.
[04:01:52.512 --> 04:01:55.394]  Impartial election observer tweets support for Hillary.
[04:01:55.434 --> 04:02:05.062]  Now, we've reported before on these international observers, again, descending onto key swing states to supposedly observe the voting process.
[04:02:05.602 --> 04:02:19.913]  Well, one of them, who is a Greek member of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, this is the OSCE, this is one of these international globalist groups that sends their people to watch, to observe the voting process.
[04:02:20.925 --> 04:02:22.626]  Again, invited by the U.S.
[04:02:22.666 --> 04:02:24.167]  State Department to do so.
[04:02:24.287 --> 04:02:25.748]  They will be on the ground today.
[04:02:25.788 --> 04:02:31.532]  They are on the ground right now in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and Florida.
[04:02:32.693 --> 04:02:44.962]  Now in a tweet, this one Greek individual, Mr. Arkoumenas, he retweeted a Politico article about how the FBI Director Comey had decided not to pursue charges against Hillary Clinton.
[04:02:46.311 --> 04:02:47.271]  What's a retweet?
[04:02:47.452 --> 04:02:52.834]  Well, he added to the retweet, quote, this should give a final boost to Hillary's campaign.
[04:02:53.174 --> 04:02:54.035]  Great news!
[04:02:55.556 --> 04:03:03.319]  In his other tweets, he's also retweeting Hillary Clinton propaganda from Hillary Clinton's official Twitter account.
[04:03:03.700 --> 04:03:08.042]  He's retweeting other commentators who are pro-Hillary Clinton.
[04:03:08.342 --> 04:03:12.184]  He's taking a picture of himself, a selfie, outside the White House.
[04:03:12.964 --> 04:03:18.608]  Again, this is supposedly an impartial international election observer.
[04:03:18.628 --> 04:03:21.971]  He's tweeting about how great Hillary Clinton is.
[04:03:21.991 --> 04:03:24.653]  He's retweeting her own official propaganda.
[04:03:24.953 --> 04:03:27.675]  He's retweeting other people who support her.
[04:03:28.476 --> 04:03:31.178]  That doesn't sound very impartial to me, does it?
[04:03:31.819 --> 04:03:35.522]  And we've only found out about this in the past six or seven hours.
[04:03:36.002 --> 04:03:41.447]  This guy's already on the ground as a supposed impartial election observer.
[04:03:42.047 --> 04:03:49.914]  How many others that are part of this international organisation, other international organisations, how many others are biased?
[04:03:49.934 --> 04:03:51.235]  How many others are compromised?
[04:03:51.255 --> 04:03:56.119]  And what the hell are they doing anywhere near a polling station, given this clear bias?
[04:03:57.441 --> 04:04:02.566]  Now again, this is out of the OSCE Observer's Code of Conduct, which states, quote,
[04:04:18.379 --> 04:04:30.025]  Well, retweeting how great Hillary Clinton is, retweeting her own official propaganda, retweeting other people who support Hillary Clinton, that kind of shows a little bias.
[04:04:30.686 --> 04:04:36.869]  Doesn't sound strictly impartial to me, yet this is one of the guys who is on the ground right now.
[04:04:38.286 --> 04:04:43.049]  At these polling stations, supposedly as an impartial observer.
[04:04:43.410 --> 04:04:46.131]  How many others are there like him?
[04:04:46.952 --> 04:04:48.073]  This is a concern.
[04:04:48.973 --> 04:04:54.217]  You know, when I voted in for Brexit, the people counting the votes are what matter.
[04:04:54.257 --> 04:04:57.279]  If they have bias, then obviously there's a chance of vote fraud.
[04:04:57.619 --> 04:05:04.263]  When I went in there to vote for Brexit, they were all bemoaning the fact that people were complaining about vote fraud.
[04:05:04.824 --> 04:05:07.446]  Of course, the people suspicious about vote fraud beforehand
[04:05:08.462 --> 04:05:09.425]  We'll leave voters.
[04:05:09.465 --> 04:05:10.888]  We're pro-Brexit voters.
[04:05:11.761 --> 04:05:20.323]  So of course if they're exhibiting a brazen bias within seconds of you even walking into a polling station, that is a concern.
[04:05:20.763 --> 04:05:26.164]  And of course we know it's more likely to be Democrats doing this because they don't play by the rules.
[04:05:26.624 --> 04:05:27.764]  They're underhanded.
[04:05:28.284 --> 04:05:31.645]  The James O'Keefe project, Veritas Tapes, proved that.
[04:05:32.025 --> 04:05:39.426]  Hiring crazy mental people to go and start violence at Donald Trump rallies and then blaming it on Donald Trump.
[04:05:40.126 --> 04:05:41.469]  They don't play by the rules!
[04:05:42.672 --> 04:05:48.004]  Oh, but when Obama talks about a rigged system, when Elizabeth Warren talks about a rigged system...
[04:05:49.093 --> 04:05:52.715]  When Bernie Sanders talks about a rigged system, then it's treated seriously.
[04:05:52.755 --> 04:05:55.876]  When Donald Trump talks about it, it's a conspiracy theory.
[04:05:56.477 --> 04:06:06.522]  Despite the fact that we now have impartial election observers publicly in the tank for Hillary Clinton, tweeting out their love for Hillary Clinton.
[04:06:07.282 --> 04:06:12.345]  Again, on the ground in these key swing states, observing the polling process.
[04:06:12.525 --> 04:06:14.706]  Is that a concern to anybody?
[04:06:16.328 --> 04:06:17.649]  Another poll has come out today.
[04:06:17.789 --> 04:06:19.149]  This is out of Al-Arabia.
[04:06:19.169 --> 04:06:23.672]  68% of Saudis prefer Hillary Clinton.
[04:06:23.912 --> 04:06:25.353]  Oh, imagine my shock!
[04:06:26.353 --> 04:06:34.637]  The corrupt, gay-killing, women-stoning dictatorships of the Middle East have come out in full support for Hillary Clinton.
[04:06:34.677 --> 04:06:35.598]  What a surprise!
[04:06:36.587 --> 04:06:52.140]  An opinion poll conducted by the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies in Washington that included nine Arab countries revealed that 68% of Saudis prefer that Hillary Clinton wins the presidential elections, while 46% thought Donald Trump was bad.
[04:06:53.181 --> 04:07:03.930]  Isn't that a surprise given that 20%, according to the Saudis themselves, 20% of Hillary Clinton's campaign has been funded by Saudi Arabia?
[04:07:04.918 --> 04:07:12.165]  A country that only just allowed women to ride bicycles for entertainment purposes, for God's sake.
[04:07:13.246 --> 04:07:17.130]  It's still not even legal for them to ride bicycles for transportation purposes.
[04:07:17.631 --> 04:07:19.293]  But Hillary's the feminist candidate.
[04:07:19.553 --> 04:07:20.974]  Vote for her, she has a vagina.
[04:07:20.994 --> 04:07:24.438]  68% of Saudis support Hillary Clinton.
[04:07:25.985 --> 04:07:53.885]  Asked which of the candidates will positively influence US policy towards the Arab region, 65% of Saudis said that Clinton's victory will positively impact the Arab region, even after she's basically destroyed a continent with her policy in the Middle East, in Libya, that led to the downfall, the murder of Gaddafi, the failed state of Libya, the international migrant crisis, the growth of ISIS.
[04:07:54.805 --> 04:08:01.712]  As Hillary, as the State Department sent ISIS weapons, as was revealed in WikiLeaks.
[04:08:02.432 --> 04:08:11.180]  So is there any surprise that the ISIS-supporting government and population of Saudi Arabia is overwhelmingly behind Hillary Clinton?
[04:08:13.022 --> 04:08:19.128]  Now in regard to the Middle East, we had another story came out of Fox News last night, summarised here by the Crowder Report.
[04:08:20.270 --> 04:08:25.034]  Clinton State Department hired terrorists for security in Benghazi.
[04:08:25.335 --> 04:08:26.556]  Yes, really.
[04:08:27.657 --> 04:08:30.700]  It's come out that they were actual Al-Qaeda members.
[04:08:31.120 --> 04:08:34.603]  They weren't just, you know, tribal militias who could be swayed either way.
[04:08:35.244 --> 04:08:35.924]  Mercenaries.
[04:08:35.984 --> 04:08:42.771]  They were actual Al-Qaeda members that they hired to guard the consulate in Benghazi before the attack.
[04:08:44.636 --> 04:08:45.336]  Here's the article.
[04:08:45.396 --> 04:08:55.141]  Most humans with basic motor function skills agree that when it comes to Benghazi, Hillary Clinton and her State Department dropped the ball in a well full of lava.
[04:08:55.681 --> 04:08:58.303]  Well, now it looks like they've screwed up even worse than we thought.
[04:08:58.683 --> 04:09:01.004]  Hard to imagine, but hold on.
[04:09:01.925 --> 04:09:10.629]  An obscure private firm hired by the State Department over internal objections to protect US diplomats in Benghazi, just months before the American ambassador and three others were killed,
[04:09:11.872 --> 04:09:18.556]  ...was staffed with hastily recruited locals with terror ties who helped carry out the attack, multiple sources told Fox News.
[04:09:18.576 --> 04:09:24.839]  And if you read the actual Fox News article, it says directly that they were Al-Qaeda members.
[04:09:25.340 --> 04:09:31.944]  Hillary Clinton's State Department hired actual Al-Qaeda terrorists to guard the U.S.
[04:09:32.024 --> 04:09:34.045]  consulate in Benghazi.
[04:09:35.157 --> 04:09:39.958]  Of course, leading to the deaths of those Americans, leading to the death of Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
[04:09:40.658 --> 04:09:44.259]  Why were they hiring Al-Qaeda members to, quote, guard the consulate?
[04:09:44.299 --> 04:09:53.662]  Well, we know, as Rand Paul exposed, they were using that consulate as a conduit to funnel weapons to jihadists in Syria.
[04:09:54.922 --> 04:10:02.764]  Again, as they knew Saudi Arabia, as they knew Qatar, and other Middle Eastern countries, the same ones that support Hillary Clinton in overwhelming numbers,
[04:10:03.956 --> 04:10:07.778]  Were funding ISIS, they were directly funneling weapons to them.
[04:10:08.258 --> 04:10:13.001]  One of the methods through which that process went was the US consulate in Benghazi.
[04:10:13.481 --> 04:10:22.426]  So no surprise, again, that those weapons would go through there, that they would hire actual Al-Qaeda members to guard the consulate.
[04:10:22.687 --> 04:10:25.548]  Just a little revelation there that came out last night.
[04:10:27.950 --> 04:10:31.672]  Again, switching back to the election, we had Lady Gaga last night.
[04:10:32.657 --> 04:10:42.302]  Who of course likes to attend these spirit cooking events, where a symbolic corpse is laid out and they eat little trinkets off of it.
[04:10:42.783 --> 04:10:49.507]  They drink mock blood off of a mock corpse, but they're all Christians and you can trust them with the nuclear codes of course.
[04:10:50.647 --> 04:11:00.333]  Lady Gaga was there and she was out last night, this is out of the sun, outraged as Lady Gaga's bizarre costume at Clinton Rally is likened to a Nazi uniform.
[04:11:01.294 --> 04:11:04.656]  And if you go to my Twitter, at Prison Planet, you can see a picture of this.
[04:11:05.737 --> 04:11:14.723]  She's literally up there, at a Hillary Clinton event, wearing this black uniform with a red armband.
[04:11:15.023 --> 04:11:18.005]  It looks exactly like a Nazi uniform.
[04:11:19.246 --> 04:11:27.291]  Right before this Hillary Clinton event, calling on people to vote for Hillary Clinton, at one point she does something like a Sig Heil salute.
[04:11:29.179 --> 04:11:31.661]  Absolutely petrifying.
[04:11:32.061 --> 04:11:32.962]  This is out of the sun.
[04:11:33.682 --> 04:11:38.426]  Pop icon Lady Gaga has been slammed for her bizarre outfit while speaking at a Hillary Clinton rally.
[04:11:38.746 --> 04:11:42.169]  The social media users likened it to a Nazi uniform.
[04:11:42.989 --> 04:11:46.052]  The singer addressed supporters of the Democratic presidential candidate.
[04:11:46.752 --> 04:11:51.716]  In North Carolina, ahead of today's election, she was dressed in a tight-backed black pantsuit.
[04:11:52.076 --> 04:11:55.399]  The star then began dancing to her song, Come to Mama.
[04:11:57.452 --> 04:11:58.893]  And again, why is this important?
[04:11:58.953 --> 04:12:01.995]  Well, it's because politics is downstream from culture.
[04:12:03.396 --> 04:12:09.821]  A lot of people are going to be going out and voting for Hillary Clinton today because Jay-Z and Beyonce told them to.
[04:12:11.482 --> 04:12:16.805]  They obey whatever their favourite pop star celebrity tells them to do.
[04:12:17.746 --> 04:12:19.567]  I mean, you can look at the Google Trends.
[04:12:20.088 --> 04:12:21.929]  One of the top Google Trends today is
[04:12:24.278 --> 04:12:27.419]  The search is who is Taylor Swift going to vote for?
[04:12:28.580 --> 04:12:36.202]  You've got thousands of young people, millennials, who are going to vote on the basis of who Taylor Swift is going to vote for.
[04:12:37.463 --> 04:12:39.344]  Again, Breitbart said it over and over.
[04:12:39.924 --> 04:12:42.365]  Politics is downstream from culture.
[04:12:43.065 --> 04:12:49.767]  This is why Hillary Clinton surrounds herself with Jay-Z, with Beyonce, with all these people.
[04:12:50.828 --> 04:12:53.769]  Because they still have a massive influence.
[04:12:54.619 --> 04:13:01.701]  So that's why you had Lady Gaga out there in basically a Nazi uniform outstomping for Hillary Clinton.
[04:13:01.801 --> 04:13:04.402]  And on that subject, we're going to go to this Mark Dice clip.
[04:13:05.203 --> 04:13:07.843]  Again, he compares it to the spirit cooking.
[04:13:07.883 --> 04:13:14.666]  If you look on my Twitter, it looks also similar to a basic Nazi uniform with the red armband and the black suit.
[04:13:14.686 --> 04:13:17.287]  But here's Mark Dice on Lady Gaga.
[04:13:17.327 --> 04:13:18.127]  Let's go to that clip.
[04:13:19.096 --> 04:13:39.369]  So, Lady Gaga, Lady Caca, the super skank from the synagogue of Satan, came out to campaign for Hillary Clinton yesterday in Raleigh, North Carolina, dressed like a character out of the Hunger Games, looking like she's ready to go to a spirit cooking dinner with Hillary Clinton and paint on the wall in blood right after her speech.
[04:13:40.069 --> 04:13:47.356]  It seems the last trick in the Clinton playbook for this election is to pull out some celebrity friends to join her on stage.
[04:13:47.737 --> 04:13:58.548]  Recently, she was also joined by Jay-Z and Baphomet, Bimbo, Booty Shaker, Beyonce, both of which are just degenerate bottom-feeding pop culture prostitutes.
[04:13:59.148 --> 04:14:03.851]  And when we look at one of the recent WikiLeaks emails, it becomes all too clear.
[04:14:04.312 --> 04:14:20.422]  Here's one sent to John Podesta by Wendy Bromphine, a marketing and branding executive who has worked with NBC, saying that Hillary Clinton needs to get trending figures to advocate for her, because that's the crap that young people pay attention to.
[04:14:20.442 --> 04:14:28.668]  If someone they, the young people, identify as cool endorses, they will likely fall in line with that candidate.
[04:14:29.288 --> 04:14:34.550]  It's f***ing dumb, but being, quote, cool counts for more than maybe it should.
[04:14:34.990 --> 04:14:41.612]  Of course, the hypocrisy couldn't be clearer while Hillary Clinton claims to be offended by Donald Trump's language.
[04:14:42.172 --> 04:14:50.815]  She invites Jay-Z to perform a free concert for her while he repeatedly drops the N-word and raps about being a pimp.
[04:14:51.315 --> 04:14:56.057]  Hating Hillary Clinton won't stop her, but voting for Donald Trump will.
[04:14:56.477 --> 04:15:04.321]  Get out to the polls and vote for Trump and help pound the final nails into the coffin of the career of the crooked Clintons.
[04:15:04.761 --> 04:15:06.022]  I'm Mark Dice, thanks for watching.
[04:15:06.262 --> 04:15:15.286]  Subscribe to the channel here if you're new and check back every day for new reports as we anxiously await the outcome of the most critical election in our nation's history.
[04:15:16.488 --> 04:15:25.773]  And as Mark Dice said there in that clip, of course he had the WikiLeaks, Clinton insiders, telling the Clinton campaign directly, look, we need to get more of these celebrities on board.
[04:15:26.614 --> 04:15:30.556]  You saw with all the YouTube video releases that they had stretching back months.
[04:15:30.636 --> 04:15:43.062]  In fact, they had another big one just yesterday, I believe, with all the celebrities coming out again saying, Donald Trump's literally Hitler if you don't vote for Hillary, it's the end of the world, even as Hillary Clinton threatens nuclear war with Russia.
[04:15:43.463 --> 04:15:45.684]  These celebrities are incredibly important.
[04:15:46.687 --> 04:15:49.048]  Two dumb people who can't think for themselves.
[04:15:49.749 --> 04:15:56.452]  That's why Conservatives need to get way more active, whatever the result of this election, on social media.
[04:15:57.552 --> 04:15:58.413]  In the culture wars!
[04:15:59.329 --> 04:16:02.711]  I mean, that's what Mark Dice has done with his YouTube channel for years and years.
[04:16:03.071 --> 04:16:05.433]  You need to take them on head-to-head.
[04:16:05.893 --> 04:16:09.355]  Because this is who young people listen to.
[04:16:09.695 --> 04:16:11.816]  They don't watch TV news media.
[04:16:12.237 --> 04:16:13.758]  They don't read newspapers.
[04:16:14.178 --> 04:16:16.319]  They barely even read any news.
[04:16:17.880 --> 04:16:19.701]  They listen to what Beyonce has to say.
[04:16:20.121 --> 04:16:22.383]  They listen to what Rihanna has to say.
[04:16:22.743 --> 04:16:24.564]  Jay-Z, Eminem, all of them.
[04:16:26.104 --> 04:16:29.186]  That's why we need to get on this battlefield, whatever happens in this election.
[04:16:29.246 --> 04:16:34.409]  That's definitely what I'm going to shift into to an increasingly greater degree.
[04:16:35.329 --> 04:16:48.196]  Again, getting on the battlefield in the culture war, because if you can take over that message, if you can hijack that narrative, then you can attract an army of young people, then you can use that platform to educate them.
[04:16:48.577 --> 04:16:53.880]  This is why Conservatives need to get more active on social media, not just Facebook.
[04:16:54.747 --> 04:16:57.309]  Okay, you need to get on Instagram, you need to get on YouTube.
[04:16:57.469 --> 04:17:01.771]  That's where you need to push your message, because that's where all the young people are.
[04:17:02.391 --> 04:17:06.334]  You need to get on Twitter, hijack the trending hashtags.
[04:17:07.234 --> 04:17:14.278]  I think this is the first election that Conservatives have actually learned to do that, learned that it's incredibly necessary.
[04:17:14.699 --> 04:17:21.883]  I mean, the amount of young people who message me saying, you know, I was a... in some cases they were outright brazen
[04:17:23.348 --> 04:17:30.070]  Freaking social justice warriors, as of a year, two years ago, they saw my videos, they saw other people's videos.
[04:17:30.970 --> 04:17:32.351]  Now they're completely on our side.
[04:17:32.371 --> 04:17:35.612]  I mean, it is possible to reach young minds.
[04:17:35.652 --> 04:17:37.192]  They're not yet fully moulded.
[04:17:37.232 --> 04:17:42.334]  We all had stupid beliefs when we were teenagers, based on lack of information.
[04:17:43.694 --> 04:17:48.336]  So we need to get out there and recruit these people, because they're going to be the voters going forward.
[04:17:49.312 --> 04:17:51.415]  You know, a lot of conservatives have recognised that.
[04:17:51.976 --> 04:17:56.642]  The domination on Twitter, of course, on Twitter everything is really an echo chamber.
[04:17:57.062 --> 04:17:59.545]  You're only hearing the opinions you want to hear.
[04:17:59.565 --> 04:18:01.388]  You're following the people who agree with you.
[04:18:02.069 --> 04:18:04.973]  Same goes if you're a conservative if you're a leftist.
[04:18:06.408 --> 04:18:12.432]  But an independent barometer of the impact that we're having is of course retweets, is of course impressions.
[04:18:12.472 --> 04:18:21.899]  You look at people, you know, like Cernovich, like Molyneux, like myself, like Alex Jones, Trump supporters, you know, the Donald Reddit.
[04:18:22.379 --> 04:18:28.704]  You look at the amount of impressions they get, you look at the amount of retweets that they get, compared to people on the opposite side.
[04:18:29.084 --> 04:18:30.525]  I mean, some of my tweets
[04:18:32.128 --> 04:18:38.250]  Probably most of them, the big ones at least, get more retweets than Hillary Clinton's tweets.
[04:18:38.590 --> 04:18:41.171]  She's got, what, 10 million followers?
[04:18:41.331 --> 04:18:43.611]  I've got 322,000.
[04:18:44.691 --> 04:18:45.972]  It's not about the followers.
[04:18:47.212 --> 04:18:48.593]  40% of hers are fake to begin with.
[04:18:49.273 --> 04:18:50.453]  It's about the impressions.
[04:18:50.513 --> 04:18:51.633]  It's about the retweets.
[04:18:52.094 --> 04:18:53.234]  And if you look at the people,
[04:18:54.229 --> 04:19:00.912]  And they did a metric back in, I think it was March, top influencers in the US presidential election.
[04:19:00.952 --> 04:19:02.432]  Of course, this was back in March.
[04:19:03.493 --> 04:19:13.016]  The people at the top of that list were alt-right figures, were conservatives, you know, people like Bill Mitchell, other people that have since been banned from Twitter, people like Milo.
[04:19:14.697 --> 04:19:17.158]  They were the top influencers as far back as March.
[04:19:17.198 --> 04:19:21.399]  That was way before we were having anything like the kind of impact that we're having now.
[04:19:21.419 --> 04:19:22.660]  So again, it's a barometer.
[04:19:23.533 --> 04:19:26.798]  Of what's resonating with the culture, with the American people.
[04:19:26.838 --> 04:19:28.661]  If you can get on social media networks...
[04:19:30.031 --> 04:19:43.974]  Where a lot of young minds are, then you can reach those people, and we've proven a heck of a lot more successful at doing that this year compared to four years ago, compared to eight years ago, and we'll see what kind of impact that has.
[04:19:44.714 --> 04:19:47.994]  Obviously millennial voters, Bernie voters, are turned off from Hillary.
[04:19:48.635 --> 04:19:51.015]  A lot of them will stay at home today, a lot of them won't.
[04:19:51.035 --> 04:19:54.996]  A lot of them will still be fooled into voting for Hillary Clinton because they're told that
[04:19:55.896 --> 04:20:00.981]  Donald Trump is the evil racist misogynist and it's literally the end of the world if they don't vote for Hillary Clinton.
[04:20:01.001 --> 04:20:01.582]  But we will see.
[04:20:01.602 --> 04:20:05.165]  We will see what kind of benchmark we have on that.
[04:20:05.846 --> 04:20:11.071]  Now we're already getting reports, again this is up on our prison planet on Twitter if you want to look at the picture.
[04:20:11.091 --> 04:20:12.993]  We have somebody in Brooklyn
[04:20:14.141 --> 04:20:16.423]  And this is on the Donald Reddit forum.
[04:20:17.224 --> 04:20:26.674]  Reports of somebody wearing a Black Lives Matter sweatshirt, and you can see the picture, he's wearing one, at a polling station in Brooklyn, intimidating people.
[04:20:27.415 --> 04:20:31.439]  This isn't somebody who just walked into the polling station, this isn't a voter.
[04:20:31.919 --> 04:20:36.704]  This is somebody working there, wearing a Black Lives Matter sweatshirt.
[04:20:37.819 --> 04:20:45.786]  Now you're not supposed to wear any political apparel, anything showing any kind of message, if you're working at a polling station.
[04:20:46.266 --> 04:20:51.751]  Even if you're not impartial, even if you're not neutral, by law you're not supposed to show that.
[04:20:52.231 --> 04:20:57.615]  Similar to how you can't recruit people to vote while wearing campaign paraphernalia.
[04:20:58.716 --> 04:21:03.600]  Or you've got somebody at a polling station in Brooklyn, and the direct address is on this link,
[04:21:04.540 --> 04:21:06.622]  Reportedly intimidating people.
[04:21:06.682 --> 04:21:09.184]  You can see that he's wearing a Black Lives Matter sweatshirt.
[04:21:09.864 --> 04:21:11.806]  These are the kind of dirty tricks they play.
[04:21:11.866 --> 04:21:21.834]  We remember the famous Black Panthers footage out of 2008 where they were casing a polling station while wielding weapons and intimidating people.
[04:21:22.215 --> 04:21:25.117]  These are the kind of tricks that leftists play.
[04:21:26.478 --> 04:21:31.983]  Now we had the footage last night which showed Hillary again being led into her car
[04:21:33.243 --> 04:21:37.694]  Walking at a very slow pace, being held up on both sides in one case.
[04:21:37.794 --> 04:21:40.701]  Now we've got her descending the steps of her campaign plane.
[04:21:41.854 --> 04:21:45.495]  This is at the American Mirror, but it's also posted on my Twitter account, the video.
[04:21:46.555 --> 04:21:51.457]  Sick Hillary needs a handrail and Bill Clinton to walk down the stairs.
[04:21:51.537 --> 04:22:05.821]  So she's walking down the steps of her campaign plane, one hand on the handrail, and then from behind Bill Clinton suddenly realizes what his role is, and he grabs her from the left and guides her down from the left.
[04:22:05.881 --> 04:22:09.522]  So she's being supported on both sides of this campaign plane.
[04:22:10.322 --> 04:22:11.743]  As she descends the steps.
[04:22:13.183 --> 04:22:15.584]  Again, we saw a similar video footage last night.
[04:22:15.604 --> 04:22:20.066]  This is a narrative that has dominated the last three months of this election.
[04:22:21.087 --> 04:22:29.010]  Ever since the subject was brought up by Droge way back at the beginning of this year, in fact before that probably, sick Hillary Clinton.
[04:22:30.431 --> 04:22:34.413]  Is she even gonna last for four years if she wins this election today?
[04:22:35.825 --> 04:22:38.107]  All this footage of her stumbling around.
[04:22:38.147 --> 04:22:40.550]  We had the infamous collapse on September 11th, of course.
[04:22:41.251 --> 04:22:43.133]  That was what reversed the poll numbers.
[04:22:43.193 --> 04:22:46.056]  Well, Trump was coming up on her anyway before that point.
[04:22:47.077 --> 04:22:52.122]  But after that September 11 incident, for the next three, four weeks, she started to crater.
[04:22:52.762 --> 04:22:55.425]  How nervous are they about her having another incident?
[04:22:55.485 --> 04:22:58.508]  Well, this footage tells you everything you need to know about that.
[04:22:59.309 --> 04:23:01.230]  Because she's walking down the steps.
[04:23:01.790 --> 04:23:06.893]  She needs Bill Clinton to support her on the other side, even though she's holding onto a handrail.
[04:23:08.574 --> 04:23:09.974]  Sick Hillary Clinton.
[04:23:10.014 --> 04:23:16.318]  Will she even get through to January, this inauguration, if it happens this way?
[04:23:17.158 --> 04:23:18.239]  Gonna get some more news now.
[04:23:18.259 --> 04:23:19.379]  We're gonna go to a break.
[04:23:20.159 --> 04:23:20.720]  Coming up...
[04:23:21.618 --> 04:23:26.799]  More celebrities tweet their Donald Trump assassination dreams.
[04:23:27.479 --> 04:23:32.080]  Again, tolerant liberals proving how loving and liberal they are once again.
[04:23:32.740 --> 04:23:35.341]  We've also got news on Germany.
[04:23:36.421 --> 04:23:42.022]  Of course, Hillary Clinton wants to import tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Muslim migrants.
[04:23:42.502 --> 04:23:45.242]  She wants to follow the example of Angela Merkel.
[04:23:45.783 --> 04:23:47.423]  Says that Merkel is her hero.
[04:23:48.473 --> 04:23:53.721]  We're going to get into what's happening in Germany as that situation continues to melt down.
[04:23:54.262 --> 04:23:58.207]  This is the Alex Jones Show live election marathon special.
[04:23:58.688 --> 04:24:00.491]  Going to go to a break now, we'll be right back.
[04:24:13.061 --> 04:24:16.205]  In the last 20 years, InfoWars has paid its dues.
[04:24:16.766 --> 04:24:21.011]  We have proven that we are a cutting-edge news and information source.
[04:24:21.692 --> 04:24:29.723]  And when it comes to funding our operations, we take cutting-edge to the next level, with the highest quality supplements and nutraceuticals available.
[04:24:30.063 --> 04:24:36.304]  We have now more than 25 different amazing formulas available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[04:24:36.604 --> 04:24:54.627]  And the flagship is Super Male and Super Female Vitality, where we take thousands of years of the ancients' knowledge and use high-tech modern technology to cold press these organic herbs to give you compounds that are meant to accentuate the body's normal function.
[04:24:54.767 --> 04:24:57.508]  We're making it easier than ever today with a special
[04:24:57.728 --> 04:25:03.953]  We're running for two weeks only, 20% off on these formulas at InfoWarsLife.com.
[04:25:04.114 --> 04:25:12.140]  Everyone out there watching and listening to me owes it to themselves to give Mother Nature a try and to try super male or super female vitality.
[04:25:13.061 --> 04:25:14.062]  Brain Force is here.
[04:25:14.583 --> 04:25:16.865]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[04:25:17.125 --> 04:25:24.952]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[04:25:25.734 --> 04:25:28.876]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[04:25:29.156 --> 04:25:29.297]  Right?
[04:25:29.317 --> 04:25:31.658]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[04:25:32.018 --> 04:25:35.541]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[04:25:35.601 --> 04:25:38.723]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[04:25:39.224 --> 04:25:44.007]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[04:25:44.567 --> 04:25:46.389]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[04:25:46.749 --> 04:25:51.192]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[04:25:51.332 --> 04:25:53.353]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[04:25:53.974 --> 04:25:55.435]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[04:25:55.575 --> 04:25:55.715]  Exactly.
[04:25:55.735 --> 04:26:00.117]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[04:26:00.137 --> 04:26:07.400]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[04:26:07.680 --> 04:26:08.140]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[04:26:22.737 --> 04:26:30.664]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[04:26:30.725 --> 04:26:33.807]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[04:26:34.619 --> 04:26:36.500]  And they're also very affordable.
[04:26:58.627 --> 04:27:05.358]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[04:27:05.759 --> 04:27:06.520]  It's a win-win.
[04:27:07.001 --> 04:27:07.963]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[04:27:12.878 --> 04:27:13.499]  We are back.
[04:27:13.919 --> 04:27:18.623]  It's the InfoWars election marathon special with me, your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[04:27:19.284 --> 04:27:23.748]  Breaking news here, report man attacks female Trump supporter at Florida polling station.
[04:27:24.048 --> 04:27:25.810]  Tolerant liberals once again.
[04:27:26.231 --> 04:27:31.435]  We had footage earlier out of New York where crazed social justice warriors, probably feminists,
[04:27:32.199 --> 04:27:34.240]  Thank God they weren't triglypuff-looking feminists.
[04:27:34.761 --> 04:27:39.604]  They basically stripped naked, started screaming about how Donald Trump was literally Hitler.
[04:27:40.124 --> 04:27:41.085]  They got arrested.
[04:27:41.645 --> 04:27:42.966]  This is out of Gateway Pundit.
[04:27:43.046 --> 04:27:45.788]  Man attacks female Trump supporter at Florida polling station.
[04:27:46.188 --> 04:27:51.091]  A woman handing out campaign literature supporting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
[04:27:51.131 --> 04:27:52.052]  How dare she?
[04:27:52.612 --> 04:28:00.377]  Was attacked and thrown to the ground by a man outside of Jupiter, Florida polling station, according to a report by Palm Beach Post reporter Lawrence Mower.
[04:28:01.872 --> 04:28:06.538]  The woman used pepper spray to defend herself after the man starts screaming in her face.
[04:28:07.420 --> 04:28:10.604]  The man then grabbed her by the neck and threw her on the ground.
[04:28:11.633 --> 04:28:22.224]  There are pictures posted on Twitter by this Palm Beach Post reporter, Lawrence Mower, who said, I'm at the Jupiter Community Center where police say a man and a woman got into a fight and the woman pepper-sprayed him.
[04:28:22.724 --> 04:28:25.728]  Witnesses say the man was yelling at a woman handing out Trump literature.
[04:28:26.548 --> 04:28:32.274]  After he voted, he came out, kept yelling at her, she pepper-sprayed him, grabbed her by the neck and he threw her down.
[04:28:33.379 --> 04:28:36.120]  So again, yet another example.
[04:28:36.220 --> 04:28:38.001]  How many examples do we need?
[04:28:38.401 --> 04:28:42.862]  I mean, this is a special tactic now of the Democratic Party.
[04:28:43.343 --> 04:28:49.405]  We know from the O'Keefe tapes that they paid crazy people to go to Donald Trump rallies to cause violence.
[04:28:50.165 --> 04:28:53.666]  We know that the Republican HQs were being firebombed.
[04:28:55.067 --> 04:28:57.748]  And again, we know that liberals are incredibly intolerant people.
[04:28:57.788 --> 04:28:59.128]  In fact, there's a new poll came out.
[04:28:59.168 --> 04:29:00.309]  This is out of Truth Revolt.
[04:29:01.741 --> 04:29:05.943]  White educated liberals, most intolerant population in 2016.
[04:29:07.003 --> 04:29:09.844]  Pew Research polls confirmed what many of us already knew.
[04:29:10.425 --> 04:29:13.926]  White liberals are some of the most intolerant people on the planet.
[04:29:14.606 --> 04:29:17.187]  They won't send you death threats if you disagree with them.
[04:29:17.707 --> 04:29:28.892]  The polling out for its latest research indicates 58% of Hillary Clinton backers say they have a hard time respecting someone who supports Donald Trump for president, with 40% having no trouble with the idea.
[04:29:29.452 --> 04:29:30.493]  It's worse among... WORSE!
[04:29:31.713 --> 04:29:35.935]  Worse amongst highly educated people at 66%.
[04:29:36.835 --> 04:29:39.576]  Even more so if they're white, 68% again.
[04:29:40.296 --> 04:29:45.618]  So there's this myth about, you know, black Democrats being the most intolerant people.
[04:29:45.658 --> 04:29:51.200]  It's actually educated white liberals who are the most intolerant.
[04:29:51.220 --> 04:29:56.262]  68% of white educated Hillary Clinton supporters are completely intolerant.
[04:29:56.282 --> 04:30:01.164]  They refuse to respect someone's opinion if they support Donald Trump for president.
[04:30:02.341 --> 04:30:07.686]  Minority supporters of Clinton are far more tolerant of their Trump counterparts.
[04:30:08.427 --> 04:30:13.031]  So then of course they looked at Trump voters and it was basically the opposite way around.
[04:30:13.071 --> 04:30:13.952]  So again, proving
[04:30:14.844 --> 04:30:21.670]  That white educated leftists are more intolerant of other people's opinions than conservatives.
[04:30:22.150 --> 04:30:23.851]  We see this with almost everything.
[04:30:24.452 --> 04:30:28.135]  They virtue signal all day long about being tolerant humanitarians.
[04:30:29.016 --> 04:30:31.017]  In fact, it's the exact opposite.
[04:30:31.057 --> 04:30:32.919]  You saw it with charity.
[04:30:33.379 --> 04:30:39.625]  They did investigations into who was more generous when it came to donating to charity, regardless of income.
[04:30:40.245 --> 04:30:47.250]  And they actually found that poorer Conservatives were more generous when it came to donating to charity than rich Liberals.
[04:30:48.311 --> 04:30:52.994]  But Conservatives aren't going to virtue signal about it all day on social media.
[04:30:53.374 --> 04:30:54.174]  They just give.
[04:30:55.575 --> 04:30:58.477]  Rich, educated Liberals are miserly about it.
[04:30:58.517 --> 04:31:01.980]  And again, this poll proves more intolerant.
[04:31:02.000 --> 04:31:03.241]  They're all for diversity.
[04:31:04.141 --> 04:31:06.303]  Until it comes to diversity of opinion.
[04:31:07.179 --> 04:31:10.440]  And on that very subject now, we have this video.
[04:31:11.740 --> 04:31:14.701]  How liberals really feel about black people.
[04:31:14.761 --> 04:31:27.483]  They basically went out, asked a bunch of white college students and SJWs wannabes what they thought about vote fraud and voter ID laws when it came to black people.
[04:31:27.523 --> 04:31:29.104]  Was it racist to ask
[04:31:30.089 --> 04:31:33.773]  I'm Ami Horowitz and I'm here in Berkeley, California to find out if voter ID laws suppress the black vote.
[04:32:01.049 --> 04:32:02.431]  Do you have an opinion on voter ID laws?
[04:32:03.212 --> 04:32:06.776]  Yeah, they're usually pretty racist and they're bad.
[04:32:06.916 --> 04:32:09.940]  I think voter ID laws are a way to perpetuate racism.
[04:32:09.960 --> 04:32:12.563]  Would you go as far as saying those laws are racist?
[04:32:12.704 --> 04:32:13.064]  For sure.
[04:32:13.084 --> 04:32:16.188]  Do you think it suppresses the African American vote?
[04:32:16.268 --> 04:32:17.209]  Definitely.
[04:32:17.229 --> 04:32:17.490]  Tell us why.
[04:32:18.050 --> 04:32:20.991]  Uh, because they're less likely to have state IDs.
[04:32:21.292 --> 04:32:28.195]  Minority voters are less likely to have the kinds of IDs that have been, um, described or required.
[04:32:28.315 --> 04:32:34.677]  These type of people don't live in areas with easy access to DMVs or other places where they can get identification.
[04:32:34.697 --> 04:32:36.818]  You can always get IDs, um, if you go over the internet.
[04:32:36.838 --> 04:32:40.240]  Does that also make it difficult for black people in particular?
[04:32:40.280 --> 04:32:41.780]  Yeah, you have to have access to the internet.
[04:32:41.800 --> 04:32:45.122]  You have to be able to pay an internet service provider for certain fees.
[04:32:45.282 --> 04:32:47.243]  Do you think that's harder for black people to go online?
[04:32:47.603 --> 04:32:49.764]  Well, I feel like they don't have the knowledge of how it works.
[04:32:49.784 --> 04:32:53.146]  A lot of people have smartphones, but you might not have data.
[04:32:53.366 --> 04:32:58.068]  For most of the communities, they don't really know what is out there just because they're not aware or they're not informed.
[04:32:58.168 --> 04:33:06.473]  I also think there's a repression of black voting with how if you're a convicted felon, you're not allowed to vote and everything.
[04:33:06.513 --> 04:33:13.096]  And when you look at swing states like Florida, that's a huge population of the African Americans.
[04:33:13.556 --> 04:33:18.483]  Now I'm here in East Harlem to ask black people their thoughts on what you just heard.
[04:33:18.503 --> 04:33:20.105]  Do you have ID normally?
[04:33:20.546 --> 04:33:21.146]  You carry ID around?
[04:33:21.166 --> 04:33:22.108]  Yes, I have state ID.
[04:33:22.628 --> 04:33:23.329]  Do you carry ID?
[04:33:23.509 --> 04:33:24.130]  Yes, I do.
[04:33:24.511 --> 04:33:26.854]  Do you know anybody, any black person who doesn't carry ID?
[04:33:27.034 --> 04:33:27.234]  No.
[04:33:27.655 --> 04:33:28.937]  Everyone that I know has an ID.
[04:33:29.197 --> 04:33:30.339]  Why would they think we don't have ID?
[04:33:31.957 --> 04:33:32.657]  That's a lie.
[04:33:33.318 --> 04:33:34.138]  Why would they say that?
[04:33:34.158 --> 04:33:34.758]  Do you have ID?
[04:33:34.778 --> 04:33:34.878]  Yes.
[04:33:34.898 --> 04:33:36.639]  Do you know any black adult who does not have ID?
[04:33:36.679 --> 04:33:36.959]  No, I don't.
[04:33:36.979 --> 04:33:38.220]  Is it a weird thing to even say that?
[04:33:38.240 --> 04:33:38.460]  Yes, it is.
[04:33:38.540 --> 04:33:38.940]  I know, right?
[04:33:58.168 --> 04:33:59.269]  That's the only thing I brought with me.
[04:33:59.449 --> 04:34:00.690]  Those are legit IDs.
[04:34:00.850 --> 04:34:05.313]  I heard a lot also that black people can't figure out how to get to the DMV.
[04:34:05.954 --> 04:34:08.255]  What does that say to you?
[04:34:08.275 --> 04:34:09.936]  Do you know where the DMV is around here?
[04:34:10.056 --> 04:34:11.297]  You know how to get there?
[04:34:11.337 --> 04:34:15.240]  Do you have a problem getting there if you have to get there?
[04:34:18.562 --> 04:34:20.524]  I know these sound like silly questions.
[04:34:20.624 --> 04:34:21.444]  You know how to get to the A&B?
[04:34:21.464 --> 04:34:21.725]  Of course.
[04:34:21.745 --> 04:34:22.465]  You know where it is?
[04:34:22.505 --> 04:34:22.745]  Yeah.
[04:34:22.765 --> 04:34:23.366]  You can get there?
[04:34:23.386 --> 04:34:23.766]  Uh-huh.
[04:34:23.786 --> 04:34:24.287]  No problem.
[04:34:24.387 --> 04:34:24.927]  No problem.
[04:34:24.947 --> 04:34:25.448]  Just checking.
[04:34:25.588 --> 04:34:26.068]  Okay.
[04:34:26.148 --> 04:34:30.612]  And I also heard a lot that black people, especially poor black people, have no access to the internet.
[04:34:30.952 --> 04:34:32.333]  Can't figure out how to use the internet.
[04:34:34.775 --> 04:34:37.257]  That's the stupidest honesty.
[04:34:37.277 --> 04:34:38.698]  Everybody has access to the internet.
[04:34:38.898 --> 04:34:40.980]  Even a little kid can figure out how to work the internet.
[04:34:41.954 --> 04:34:43.695]  I had access to the internet for years.
[04:34:44.336 --> 04:34:45.336]  You know how to use it properly?
[04:34:45.516 --> 04:34:46.737]  Exactly, I do it at work.
[04:34:47.017 --> 04:34:48.218]  So of course I know how to use it.
[04:34:48.238 --> 04:34:49.379]  My kids know how to use it.
[04:34:49.619 --> 04:34:51.940]  They all have iPads, iPods, whatever.
[04:34:51.980 --> 04:34:53.681]  Your phone has data?
[04:34:54.302 --> 04:34:55.342]  Unlimited.
[04:34:55.582 --> 04:34:56.483]  Unlimited data.
[04:34:56.523 --> 04:34:57.804]  I use my phone as a hotspot.
[04:34:57.884 --> 04:35:01.446]  What does that say to you for the people who have this perception of black people?
[04:35:02.086 --> 04:35:03.887]  They're pretty much ignorant.
[04:35:04.248 --> 04:35:05.969]  That's what my thought process was.
[04:35:06.169 --> 04:35:07.169]  I don't think that's ignorant.
[04:35:07.570 --> 04:35:08.130]  It's ignorant.
[04:35:08.510 --> 04:35:09.910]  Ignorant, that's the word I hear a lot.
[04:35:09.951 --> 04:35:10.491]  Very, very ignorant.
[04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:11.691]  It's very, very ignorant.
[04:35:11.851 --> 04:35:14.392]  Does it sound racist for somebody to say that?
[04:35:15.332 --> 04:35:21.514]  I think it is a little racist because you're putting people in a category and you have no idea what you're talking about.
[04:35:21.794 --> 04:35:25.736]  Maybe a little bit racist in it, but like I said, I think it's more stupidity and ignorance.
[04:35:25.776 --> 04:35:29.677]  You're judging somebody, but you're judging somebody black saying that they don't got it.
[04:35:30.382 --> 04:35:31.623]  What people are they talking to?
[04:35:32.283 --> 04:35:33.924]  Who are these people talking to?
[04:35:34.164 --> 04:35:38.446]  Do you have a problem that if you go to vote and they say, could we please see your ID to make sure you are who you say you are?
[04:35:38.986 --> 04:35:40.067]  I love showing my ID.
[04:35:40.087 --> 04:35:40.947]  You have no problem with that?
[04:35:40.987 --> 04:35:41.107]  Nope.
[04:35:41.588 --> 04:35:46.930]  Would you have a problem if when you go to vote and they say, could we please see your ID to make sure you are who you say you are?
[04:35:46.970 --> 04:35:47.951]  Do you have an issue with that?
[04:35:47.971 --> 04:35:48.011]  No.
[04:35:48.211 --> 04:35:51.553]  Would you have a problem if there was a rule where you had to show your ID in order to vote?
[04:35:53.113 --> 04:35:54.374]  I don't think so, no.
[04:35:54.714 --> 04:35:58.256]  Would you have an issue if there was a rule saying you got to show your ID before you vote?
[04:36:00.219 --> 04:36:00.759]  You call that?
[04:36:02.180 --> 04:36:04.461]  Yeah.
[04:36:04.501 --> 04:36:16.566]  So again, they go out and ask educated white liberals about voter ID laws when it comes to black people, and basically they say, oh yeah, black people, this is what they intimate.
[04:36:16.606 --> 04:36:20.127]  Anyway, black people, too stupid to know they have to carry ID.
[04:36:20.487 --> 04:36:22.788]  Too stupid to know how to find the DMV.
[04:36:23.228 --> 04:36:27.030]  Too stupid to know how to operate the internet, or they can't afford it.
[04:36:28.226 --> 04:36:30.047]  Bigotry of low expectations.
[04:36:30.107 --> 04:36:31.827]  Again, I've made this point over and over again.
[04:36:32.348 --> 04:36:36.049]  So then they actually go and interview the black people and they say, well, what the hell are you talking about?
[04:36:36.429 --> 04:36:37.510]  Of course I've got an ID.
[04:36:37.850 --> 04:36:39.631]  Of course I know how to find the DMV.
[04:36:39.971 --> 04:36:42.652]  Of course I know how to use the friggin' internet!
[04:36:44.172 --> 04:36:49.074]  But again, it's all these white, educated liberals getting offended on behalf of minorities.
[04:36:49.714 --> 04:36:52.235]  And this is the message we try to drive across over and over again.
[04:36:52.836 --> 04:37:00.439]  More and more black people are getting off the plantation, realizing these democratic policies of dependence don't benefit them.
[04:37:00.639 --> 04:37:03.760]  They only keep them held back and held down.
[04:37:04.100 --> 04:37:10.303]  But you will continue to see white, educated social justice warriors get offended on behalf of black people.
[04:37:11.499 --> 04:37:14.802]  And then call us the bigots for trying to lift up black people.
[04:37:15.382 --> 04:37:17.284]  But again, liberals are completely intolerant.
[04:37:17.844 --> 04:37:19.826]  Now a new poll proves that they're intolerant.
[04:37:20.266 --> 04:37:26.592]  And the tweets that we're already seeing on this election day underscore again that they're intolerant.
[04:37:27.072 --> 04:37:30.815]  In fact, there was a tweet last night which I retweeted about myself this morning.
[04:37:31.940 --> 04:37:40.103]  From Steven Bunnell, who is a game streamer, he has a verified Twitter account, he's not just some random person, he is known on the internet.
[04:37:40.883 --> 04:37:44.524]  Quote, are you going to kill yourself tomorrow when Trump loses?
[04:37:46.245 --> 04:37:47.325]  Another tolerant liberal.
[04:37:48.105 --> 04:37:51.386]  Nick Naverne, he's an actor, writer and director.
[04:37:51.686 --> 04:37:52.687]  He tweeted this.
[04:37:53.547 --> 04:37:54.948]  Here's my election prediction.
[04:37:55.409 --> 04:37:59.152]  If Trump wins, he will be assassinated within 48 hours.
[04:37:59.652 --> 04:38:03.735]  That, or we should start a crowdfund to make it happen!
[04:38:05.857 --> 04:38:20.289]  So again, Trump is the bigot, his supporters are deplorables, they're horrible people for lowering the tone of this election, yet it's okay to joke about Trump being assassinated on a regular basis, as well as his supporters being killed.
[04:38:20.309 --> 04:38:21.910]  We've seen that before, we've seen it even with
[04:38:23.993 --> 04:38:31.997]  Never Trump people, because we have the so-called conservative Ross Douthat, the New York Times reporter, again, joking about Trump's assassination.
[04:38:32.897 --> 04:38:37.239]  They lionize people who jump up on stage and try to attack Trump.
[04:38:38.186 --> 04:38:39.647]  We saw that back in March.
[04:38:39.707 --> 04:38:45.689]  We saw them attempting to lionize this disruptor who was in the crowd the other evening.
[04:38:46.069 --> 04:38:47.810]  Of course, there was a fear that he had a gun.
[04:38:47.830 --> 04:38:49.911]  The Secret Service had to rush Trump off stage.
[04:38:50.191 --> 04:38:52.212]  They lionized these people over and over again.
[04:38:53.152 --> 04:39:05.698]  You can bet for a second, if there was any kind of disturbance like that at a Hillary Clinton event, unless it's Greenpeace or some left-winger, they would immediately denounce the violent, racist bigot behind it.
[04:39:06.800 --> 04:39:14.241]  When in fact, liberals again, the most bigoted, the most intolerant people, the most miserly people when it comes to charitable donations.
[04:39:15.062 --> 04:39:17.142]  But again, some people are getting off the reservation.
[04:39:18.122 --> 04:39:21.763]  Is there going to be a significant black turnout in support for Trump?
[04:39:22.143 --> 04:39:24.543]  The polls have said it's not going to happen, many of them.
[04:39:25.663 --> 04:39:27.644]  Anecdotal evidence suggests that it is.
[04:39:28.464 --> 04:39:31.265]  How many of those black people are going to get off the plantation?
[04:39:31.725 --> 04:39:33.405]  How many women are going to realize
[04:39:34.673 --> 04:39:37.059]  That having a vagina is not a merit.
[04:39:37.239 --> 04:39:43.655]  Hillary Clinton has literally said this entire election process, vote for me because I have a vagina, because I'm a woman.
[04:39:44.707 --> 04:39:46.168]  That's what she said to people.
[04:39:46.809 --> 04:39:48.431]  How many women will believe that?
[04:39:48.771 --> 04:39:51.434]  How many will be able to think for themselves?
[04:39:51.474 --> 04:39:54.477]  In fact, we've got another clip here from Mark Dice.
[04:39:54.517 --> 04:39:56.619]  This is why women hate Hillary again.
[04:39:56.759 --> 04:40:04.086]  Proving that many of these people are now getting off the plantation, tuning out mainstream propaganda, tuning out these narratives.
[04:40:04.907 --> 04:40:10.289]  This identity politics narrative that you have to vote for Hillary because she's a woman.
[04:40:10.789 --> 04:40:18.131]  Here's why women, and this is in San Diego, not the most conservative area, Mark Dice, why women hate Hillary.
[04:40:18.171 --> 04:40:18.912]  Let's roll the clip.
[04:40:19.912 --> 04:40:22.353]  Talking to women to find out what's wrong with Hillary.
[04:40:22.373 --> 04:40:25.054]  We want to know why everybody hates her.
[04:40:25.074 --> 04:40:25.874]  We hate her.
[04:40:26.685 --> 04:40:30.128]  I'm not a fan of her either because she's a criminal.
[04:40:31.308 --> 04:40:32.829]  It's pretty much how I would put it.
[04:40:32.849 --> 04:40:33.110]  Okay.
[04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:34.651]  Why do you hate Hillary Clinton?
[04:40:34.711 --> 04:40:36.792]  She's a liar and I hate her voice.
[04:40:36.812 --> 04:40:39.914]  Her voice drives me crazy.
[04:40:39.934 --> 04:40:41.916]  What's wrong with Hillary Clinton?
[04:40:42.676 --> 04:40:43.697]  She has a period.
[04:40:43.717 --> 04:40:45.798]  She's too emotional.
[04:40:50.336 --> 04:40:54.858]  I always say I do not get in conversations about politics because it always gets dirty.
[04:40:54.878 --> 04:40:56.499]  It always gets messy.
[04:40:56.639 --> 04:40:58.119]  She's a liar.
[04:40:58.239 --> 04:40:58.739]  She's a liar.
[04:40:59.300 --> 04:40:59.740]  She's a liar.
[04:41:00.700 --> 04:41:02.361]  She's a liar.
[04:41:02.881 --> 04:41:03.621]  She's terrible.
[04:41:03.882 --> 04:41:08.483]  She lost to Obama eight years ago, so why she's still running is kind of absurd to me.
[04:41:09.384 --> 04:41:10.184]  I don't like Hillary.
[04:41:10.584 --> 04:41:12.245]  Tell us what's wrong with that witch.
[04:41:13.564 --> 04:41:17.566]  I just believe in more personal freedom and less government control.
[04:41:17.586 --> 04:41:18.427]  That's what she's all about.
[04:41:18.687 --> 04:41:19.547]  She's also a liar.
[04:41:20.288 --> 04:41:30.093]  She has all kinds of money that she took from our government and gets from public speaking for all kinds of associations that we as the United States government don't want to be associated with.
[04:41:31.014 --> 04:41:35.016]  Well, she's just always run by big money and she has so many scandals going on.
[04:41:37.077 --> 04:41:41.321]  I just don't think she has any good policies going forward, so I'm just not interested.
[04:41:41.361 --> 04:41:53.390]  I know she plays the female card, and I'm a female, and I wouldn't mind a female president, but I don't want one just to have one if I don't agree with her policies and I don't think it's for a better America, then that's not something that I want.
[04:41:58.035 --> 04:41:59.396]  In office far too long.
[04:41:59.496 --> 04:42:05.361]  We need somebody fresh and is not easily persuaded by lobbyists.
[04:42:06.382 --> 04:42:09.205]  So I would say... Someone is not a thief.
[04:42:09.465 --> 04:42:10.266]  You're not a woman.
[04:42:10.506 --> 04:42:10.886]  Or are you?
[04:42:10.926 --> 04:42:12.487]  I didn't mean to mispronounce you.
[04:42:12.788 --> 04:42:13.408]  You're transgender.
[04:42:13.428 --> 04:42:14.029]  Just an echo.
[04:42:14.149 --> 04:42:14.509]  Sorry.
[04:42:15.390 --> 04:42:16.151]  It's time for a change.
[04:42:16.171 --> 04:42:17.151]  Hillary's out of here.
[04:42:17.292 --> 04:42:18.032]  You're very nice.
[04:42:18.112 --> 04:42:21.855]  I mean, I would say that witch worships Satan and she should crawl back into the pits of hell.
[04:42:21.875 --> 04:42:23.437]  But you put it very nicely.
[04:42:23.937 --> 04:42:25.538]  We're talking to women who hate Hillary.
[04:42:25.598 --> 04:42:28.179]  Just want to get your opinions about her.
[04:42:31.580 --> 04:42:32.180]  No comments.
[04:42:32.200 --> 04:42:32.521]  Sorry.
[04:42:32.541 --> 04:42:33.921]  I didn't think that was going to be it.
[04:42:33.941 --> 04:42:34.822]  Did I mispronounce you?
[04:42:36.323 --> 04:42:43.485]  I mean, if we're not wearing our gender identity name badges here, I mean, how am I supposed to know who's a woman and who's not?
[04:42:43.705 --> 04:42:44.605]  So I didn't mean to offend you.
[04:42:45.365 --> 04:42:46.505]  No, not offended.
[04:42:46.565 --> 04:42:47.305]  Okay, thank you.
[04:42:58.888 --> 04:43:05.272]  But it goes to the point of many of these women, these minorities, finally getting off the plantation and being able to think for themselves.
[04:43:05.853 --> 04:43:24.225]  Unlike the Young Turks' Anna Kasparian, the woman who decries fat shaming all day, then gets up and calls Alex Jones a fat F. She's out, this is out of Truth Revolt, saying that self-hating women Trump supporters belong in the kitchen.
[04:43:24.865 --> 04:43:26.907]  This is Anna Kasparian of the Young Turks,
[04:43:27.967 --> 04:43:33.570]  Skewered women Donald Trump supporters as a bunch of self-hating rubes who belong in a kitchen.
[04:43:34.570 --> 04:43:42.013]  In a column for Raw Story, Kasparian quite hypocritically slammed women supporting Trump despite his current sexual assault allegations.
[04:43:42.854 --> 04:43:46.836]  One of which now turns out, another one of which turns out to be complete nonsense.
[04:43:46.876 --> 04:43:51.838]  The so-called 13-year-old rape victim has now admitted that was completely made up as we knew.
[04:43:53.137 --> 04:43:57.481]  Not arguing once how that reasoning squares with Hillary's husband Bill Clinton.
[04:43:57.501 --> 04:44:01.944]  Of course, the rape allegations that followed him his entire career.
[04:44:02.465 --> 04:44:03.806]  We're not talking about those.
[04:44:03.866 --> 04:44:06.468]  We're talking about debunked stories about Donald Trump.
[04:44:07.789 --> 04:44:13.474]  So again, Anna Kasparian says that basically Donald Trump supporting women are horrible people.
[04:44:13.514 --> 04:44:15.255]  They belong back in the kitchen.
[04:44:15.996 --> 04:44:21.901]  Because if they could, they would vote to annul voting rights for women altogether.
[04:44:23.479 --> 04:44:36.121]  What she doesn't include in this argument is the fact that it was a Republican in 1878 who first introduced the 19th Amendment to allow women to vote.
[04:44:36.642 --> 04:44:39.262]  Who struck down that amendment over and over again?
[04:44:39.282 --> 04:44:41.643]  And it was Democrats.
[04:44:42.303 --> 04:44:43.063]  Over and over again.
[04:44:43.423 --> 04:44:48.744]  For years and years and years, Republicans tried to introduce this amendment to allow women to vote.
[04:44:50.069 --> 04:44:53.541]  It was shot down time and time again by Democrats.
[04:44:54.103 --> 04:44:54.544]  A.A.
[04:44:54.665 --> 04:44:55.166]  Sargent.
[04:44:55.206 --> 04:44:56.491]  This is out of Spectator.org.
[04:44:57.597 --> 04:45:03.239]  introduced the 19th Amendment only to see it voted down by a Democrat-controlled Congress.
[04:45:03.860 --> 04:45:17.985]  It finally ended four decades later when the Republican won landslide victories in the House and the Senate, giving them the power to pass the amendment despite continued opposition from most elected Democrats.
[04:45:18.585 --> 04:45:27.009]  For four decades, Democrats tried to disenfranchise women, were successful in doing so, prevented women from voting.
[04:45:29.415 --> 04:45:33.657]  1914, it was brought up once again, defeated by Senate Democrats.
[04:45:34.157 --> 04:45:40.960]  It was brought up for a vote in January 1915 in the House, where it went down by a vote 204 to 174.
[04:45:42.201 --> 04:45:47.884]  Again and again, Democrats opposed, voted against the right for women to vote.
[04:45:48.584 --> 04:45:51.706]  It was Republicans that brought this up time and time again.
[04:45:52.577 --> 04:46:01.619]  Yet the Young Turks' Anna Kasparian is out saying that Donald Trump voters should get back in the kitchen because they're not real feminists.
[04:46:01.679 --> 04:46:06.579]  Because if given the choice, they would vote to take away the vote for women.
[04:46:07.100 --> 04:46:10.100]  Again, historically completely debunked.
[04:46:10.820 --> 04:46:13.161]  She has no idea what the hell she's talking about.
[04:46:13.521 --> 04:46:20.582]  No idea of the history that it was Democrats who disenfranchised women in America at every single point.
[04:46:22.159 --> 04:46:28.444]  The New York Post is reporting this insanely accurate model is still predicting a Trump victory.
[04:46:29.125 --> 04:46:36.571]  It's not just the presidency that's at stake in this election, but also bragging rights for two prognosticators that are almost always right.
[04:46:37.574 --> 04:46:44.437]  This year, one of them is absolutely certain Donald Trump will be living in the White House, while the other is just as sure that Hillary Clinton can't lose.
[04:46:45.118 --> 04:46:49.440]  Now, it's basically Moody's Analytics versus Helmut Norpoth.
[04:46:49.520 --> 04:46:52.021]  We've featured this professor over and over again.
[04:46:52.541 --> 04:47:04.687]  He's the one who's correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election since 1912, with the exception of 2000, when he did accurately predict that Al Gore would win the popular vote.
[04:47:05.487 --> 04:47:07.568]  So again, he's got it right virtually every time.
[04:47:08.168 --> 04:47:11.248]  Moody's analytics have got it right virtually every time.
[04:47:11.708 --> 04:47:14.629]  They're saying that it's a Clinton landslide.
[04:47:14.669 --> 04:47:26.412]  They're saying she's going to get 332 electoral votes, whereas Norpoth, on the other hand, is still sticking to his prediction, overwhelmingly, of a Donald Trump victory.
[04:47:27.152 --> 04:47:32.033]  So one of those things has got to change over the next 12 hours or so.
[04:47:32.553 --> 04:47:34.754]  One of them is going to have to be wrong.
[04:47:36.021 --> 04:47:46.428]  Now, of course, Hillary Clinton, one of her primary policies is to import thousands, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of quote Syrian migrants who aren't really Syrian.
[04:47:46.789 --> 04:47:49.430]  In many cases, most of them aren't even migrants.
[04:47:49.470 --> 04:47:51.232]  They're coming here for economic purposes.
[04:47:52.315 --> 04:47:55.879]  Well, Germany's experiencing the cultural enrichment that that brings.
[04:47:55.979 --> 04:47:57.121]  This is out of the Express.
[04:47:57.881 --> 04:47:59.063]  Germany no-go zones.
[04:47:59.103 --> 04:48:03.007]  Police afraid to go into lawless areas after open-door immigration.
[04:48:03.728 --> 04:48:12.478]  No-go zones are emerging throughout Germany as they have become lawless places where even police are attacked as a result of mass immigration, according to a report.
[04:48:13.439 --> 04:48:22.444]  Gangs of men are preventing people from straying into once vibrant areas of the country for fear of violence and abuse that even law enforcement has been unable to control.
[04:48:23.405 --> 04:48:25.006]  We featured a video about a week ago.
[04:48:25.446 --> 04:48:30.149]  Older immigrants in Germany, even they're decrying these new breed of immigrants.
[04:48:30.169 --> 04:48:33.190]  They're saying they don't buy anything from our stores, they just cause trouble.
[04:48:33.471 --> 04:48:39.214]  It was the immigrants in Germany that have been there for decades that are calling for the new immigrants to be deported.
[04:48:40.762 --> 04:48:42.906]  This is the situation in Germany right now.
[04:48:43.346 --> 04:48:44.989]  No go zones.
[04:48:45.069 --> 04:48:46.231]  The police can't go there.
[04:48:46.452 --> 04:48:47.754]  Ambulance workers can't go there.
[04:48:47.914 --> 04:48:48.956]  Firemen can't go there.
[04:48:49.176 --> 04:48:50.679]  You've seen the situation in Malmo.
[04:48:51.621 --> 04:48:56.087]  And yet the left still claims that Muslim no-go ghettos don't exist.
[04:48:56.747 --> 04:48:58.630]  That they're a conspiracy theory.
[04:48:59.190 --> 04:49:08.442]  When we have police themselves coming forward complaining that they can't go to these areas, they're bricked, they're bottled, they're attacked.
[04:49:08.842 --> 04:49:10.784]  This is the new cultural enrichment.
[04:49:11.673 --> 04:49:33.182]  And now in Germany you have a school teacher in Berlin fired because she supported AFD, Alternative for Germany, which of course is the primary party in Germany, opposing this cultural enrichment, opposing this migration, mass Muslim migration that Hillary Clinton wants to bring to America.
[04:49:33.523 --> 04:49:35.043]  Will she succeed?
[04:49:35.083 --> 04:49:38.505]  We will find out in around 12 hours time or less.
[04:49:39.667 --> 04:49:41.228]  That's gonna wrap it up for me though.
[04:49:41.428 --> 04:49:43.790]  I will be back 4 to 5 p.m.
[04:49:43.990 --> 04:49:45.491]  Central Standard Time.
[04:49:45.832 --> 04:49:54.018]  But stay tuned because coming up with the live radio show is Alex Jones breaking election news at InfoWars.com
[04:50:15.023 --> 04:50:17.905]  It's quite a swamp that Donald Trump is trying to drain.
[04:50:18.265 --> 04:50:19.686]  This is an epic time to be alive.
[04:50:20.066 --> 04:50:21.107]  Where do you want to start, Roger?
[04:50:21.267 --> 04:50:23.128]  It's almost impossible to know where to start.
[04:50:23.268 --> 04:50:31.934]  This is an extraordinary election in which you have developments that I think are really seismic virtually every day.
[04:50:31.954 --> 04:50:32.854]  Earthquakes every day.
[04:50:33.555 --> 04:50:37.197]  Yeah, and it's hard to understand how the FBI director
[04:50:37.981 --> 04:50:54.240]  Well, I believe, technically, reports to the Attorney General could not reopen this investigation without the approval of the President of the United States, yet today there are reports that the White House was blindsided and the Attorney General was blindsided.
[04:50:54.880 --> 04:50:56.921]  I find that hard to believe.
[04:50:57.322 --> 04:51:03.005]  You're saying that the elite are deserting Hillary, and this is Obama getting ready to flush her.
[04:51:03.305 --> 04:51:11.450]  She could conceivably live through this election, although I think the late momentum is very definitely with Donald Trump.
[04:51:12.550 --> 04:51:16.933]  This event, Comey making this announcement,
[04:51:17.583 --> 04:51:21.346]  Has very clearly knocked the air out of the Clinton campaign.
[04:51:21.466 --> 04:51:29.673]  The whole media wouldn't even cover her first press conference or her first speech saying, we don't know what she's saying, so we don't know if she's been briefed, so we're not going to show you.
[04:51:29.953 --> 04:51:31.855]  They seem to be in true panic mode.
[04:51:32.015 --> 04:51:42.103]  It's hard for me to believe that the FBI director makes an announcement of this import without the approval of this boss, the President of the United States.
[04:51:42.323 --> 04:51:44.004]  I just find that very hard.
[04:51:44.124 --> 04:51:45.966]  So where would you put the race right now?
[04:51:47.142 --> 04:51:55.749]  It's still a toss-up, but momentum is what's important because the race is going to be in a different place tomorrow than it was today and than it was yesterday.
[04:51:56.210 --> 04:51:59.532]  That's how volatile and close this is.
[04:51:59.612 --> 04:52:01.874]  We're now eight days and a few hours out from this.
[04:52:02.695 --> 04:52:03.636]  Other wild cards?
[04:52:03.716 --> 04:52:04.757]  Are the Clintons out of ammo?
[04:52:04.797 --> 04:52:05.437]  What else could happen?
[04:52:05.778 --> 04:52:09.761]  Well, first of all, as you know, voting has started across the country.
[04:52:09.881 --> 04:52:13.364]  Early voting in a number of states and the volume
[04:52:14.268 --> 04:52:18.765]  Of irregularities already is deeply concerned today.
