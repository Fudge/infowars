[00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:22.283]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.404 --> 00:00:23.664]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:27.707]  It is July 12th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:39.635]  Tonight, the so-called anti-Wall Street candidate has officially announced his endorsement for Hillary Clinton.
[00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:47.621]  I have come here to make it as clear as possible as to why I am endorsing Hillary Clinton
[00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:54.566]  Bernie Sanders folds and wants his followers to vote for the Queen of Wall Street.
[00:00:54.826 --> 00:01:04.114]  Then a petition to declare Black Lives Matter a terrorist organization has quickly reached a hundred plus thousand signatures and
[00:01:04.454 --> 00:01:04.975]  Growing.
[00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:20.550]  Plus, more inside baseball on the mindset of FBI boss James Comey, who not only recently cleared Hillary Clinton on all charges, but we now know that Comey has connections to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.014]  All that plus much more, up next on the InfoWars Nightly News!
[00:02:01.098 --> 00:02:06.701]  Last week we pointed out the globalists have declared open season on free individuals and nations worldwide.
[00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:11.023]  When the British left the Euro, the globalists decided to go into high gear.
[00:02:11.343 --> 00:02:15.125]  They've now announced that Hillary won't be indicted no matter how many crimes she commits.
[00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:17.346]  It's time for us to take our matters into our own hands.
[00:02:17.586 --> 00:02:19.828]  The globalist warfare model is siege.
[00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:21.388]  It wants to make us dependent.
[00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:22.789]  It wants to cut off our economies.
[00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.831]  It wants to be able to set up a worldwide financial crisis.
[00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:33.053]  Where there are food shortages that are already happening in most parts of the world, where they basically bring us to our knees and where we capitulate to their demands.
[00:02:33.393 --> 00:02:40.915]  That's why we're extending the July 4th sale right through next week, because it's all about declaring your independence from the globalists.
[00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:47.217]  You don't just declare independence when you buy high-quality, storable foods or water filters or shortwave radios at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:54.185]  You declare your independence when you share links of articles and videos and information from the broadcast because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:58.028]  It's a total 360 win at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.931]  And welcome back.
[00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:08.296]  Recently, a petition launched to recognize Black Lives Matter as an official terrorist organization.
[00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:13.640]  If you go to whitehouse.gov, you can see that it has over 100,000 signatures.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.647]  Now, many people are going to find out the hard way that when you do petitions on whitehouse.gov, they're just basically a suggestion box, like if you go to a
[00:03:21.087 --> 00:03:24.109]  A restaurant or a movie theater and they say, hey, put your suggestions here.
[00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.711]  It doesn't really mean anything.
[00:03:25.731 --> 00:03:32.476]  There's been many petitions on whitehouse.gov that even though they got the required number of signatures, the White House didn't even bother to address.
[00:03:32.856 --> 00:03:39.181]  Some things were just, you know, kind of goofy, funny things like build a real Death Star, other things that a little more seriously so that we don't care.
[00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:41.423]  So take that for what it is.
[00:03:41.803 --> 00:03:49.750]  But now I want to spend a little bit of time talking about Black Lives Matter in people's view of them of as a terrorist organization, because I think
[00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.492]  Like anything, there's many assets and facets to the organization.
[00:03:54.792 --> 00:03:56.653]  And I'll give you the example of the police, right?
[00:03:56.693 --> 00:04:00.795]  So, you can see plenty of videos out there of police doing wrong.
[00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:03.236]  You know, police shooting some unarmed guy in the back.
[00:04:03.556 --> 00:04:05.857]  Or choking a guy to death because he was selling cigarettes.
[00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:07.038]  Or you know, beating a guy to death.
[00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:11.380]  Over the course of 20 minutes while he is screaming for, you know, mercy and for his daddy to come and save him.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.741]  And on and on and on.
[00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:16.783]  And that's one aspect of the police, but it's not the aspect of the police.
[00:04:16.883 --> 00:04:21.526]  On the flip side, you have the videos of cops, you know, saving little cats out of trees or...
[00:04:22.506 --> 00:04:26.109]  Walking kids home in a bad neighborhood or giving boots to a homeless man.
[00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:36.018]  So yes, while the bad stuff happens, also the good stuff happens as well, and you can't just pick one side or the other to view the police departments as in the United States of America.
[00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:47.368]  Conversely, when you talk about a group like Black Lives Matter, I've personally witnessed these guys in various cities around the country, you know, start fires or, you know, loot
[00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:49.029]  We're good to go.
[00:05:11.178 --> 00:05:18.941]  But that stuff doesn't get the type of publicity that the negative stuff does, because it's not as sensational, doesn't sell as many newspapers, or doesn't get as many clicks on YouTube.
[00:05:19.281 --> 00:05:27.125]  So while I do recognize, and I'm definitely not trying to downplay the bad things that Black Lives Matter has done, I also recognize the good things that don't get as much publicity.
[00:05:27.705 --> 00:05:35.428]  Also, when you talk about a group like Black Lives Matter, to make a very, very loose comparison, when you think about a group like Anonymous, where anybody can be anonymous.
[00:05:35.508 --> 00:05:42.790]  All you have to do is go buy a Guy Fawkes mask, turn off the light, shoot a video, and put it on YouTube, and you're considered a part of Anonymous.
[00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:53.533]  In a similar way, anybody can go buy a Black Lives Matter t-shirt, and since there's no governing body, nobody to say, yes, you can be in, no, your membership is revoked, anybody can be a part of the group.
[00:05:55.663 --> 00:06:00.984]  You have to take all this in consideration when you just want to say the group in general is a terrorist organization.
[00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:12.907]  Also, another thing I want to point out, just being personally at many of these events, a lot of times when there's one guy wearing a Black Lives Matter t-shirt in a rally, usually it's more than one, but she's using that example.
[00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:19.788]  If there's one and something bad happens, like those examples I said, people jumping on cars or rioting or looting buildings.
[00:06:20.248 --> 00:06:27.955]  Black Lives Matter in general gets the blame even if those people weren't self-identifying as Black Lives Matter members.
[00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:39.726]  Because once again, when you have something that anybody can sign up for or say they're a part of, when they see these guys on TV with their pants down looting the quick trip or whatever it is, they just stop and ask these guys, are they Black Lives Matter?
[00:06:39.747 --> 00:06:41.828]  Do they self-identify as Black Lives Matter?
[00:06:41.848 --> 00:06:45.292]  Do they put Black Lives Matter things on their Facebook and Twitter pages?
[00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:53.798]  So the point I'm trying to make here is every time you see a black person at a rally doing something negative doesn't mean that they're affiliated with Black Lives Matter.
[00:06:54.138 --> 00:06:56.079]  And that's the point I'm really trying to drive home here.
[00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:02.043]  Because I think while I do recognize the bad things that they've done, oftentimes it's such a generalized thing that...
[00:07:03.484 --> 00:07:10.194]  They just assume that these people are affiliated with Black Lives Matter or have Black Lives Matter sympathies when sometimes they really don't.
[00:07:10.314 --> 00:07:14.701]  It's just maybe there were Black Lives Matter there, but there are other people who weren't affiliated with the group at all.
[00:07:15.342 --> 00:07:17.225]  They also could have been doing good or bad things.
[00:07:18.664 --> 00:07:23.588]  By and large, I think with a wide brush to paint them as a terrorist organization, I think is too much.
[00:07:23.608 --> 00:07:25.889]  It'd be, like I said, to say the police are terrorists.
[00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:27.471]  You got good police, you got bad police.
[00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:30.253]  You got good people at these rallies, you got bad people at these rallies.
[00:07:30.293 --> 00:07:35.797]  And just to blanket call them one thing or another, I think is a very crude oversimplification.
[00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:37.911]  But that's my thought on that.
[00:07:37.931 --> 00:07:42.114]  And only time will tell because things are getting pretty hot in the country right now.
[00:07:42.194 --> 00:07:44.495]  People trying to start race wars for whatever reason.
[00:07:44.555 --> 00:07:46.596]  I think that they think is a good idea.
[00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:48.738]  It's failed rather spectacularly.
[00:07:48.798 --> 00:07:55.822]  If you guys remember the case of Dylan Roof down in Charleston, South Carolina, his goal when he shot up the church was to start a race war.
[00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:58.464]  You know, nobody was buying that, at least down there.
[00:07:58.484 --> 00:07:59.725]  And, you know, it's a very peaceful time.
[00:07:59.765 --> 00:08:05.469]  I was actually very glad to be down there and see how the city decided to turn to positivity instead of
[00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:08.390]  Turning on itself and rioting and burning stuff.
[00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.991]  I think the worst thing that happened while I was there was a statue got spray-painted.
[00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:20.874]  And if that's the worst thing that happens in Charleston, South Carolina, I think you guys should consider yourself very lucky that it's a little different in the city of Dallas, Texas.
[00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:24.816]  They say they've had a long history of questionable police activities.
[00:08:25.196 --> 00:08:27.978]  A lot of the officers have recently left Dallas, I believe.
[00:08:28.358 --> 00:08:32.140]  In May alone, they had 40 or so officers leave and go to various departments.
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.881]  More left in June, if I remember correctly.
[00:08:34.921 --> 00:08:42.646]  So, it's a big problem that's not going to be solved anytime soon, but just the general terrorist label I don't think is accurate and just an oversimplification.
[00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:45.734]  Now let's talk about some other things going on overseas.
[00:08:46.014 --> 00:08:51.918]  We see that the Chinese President has ordered the People's Liberation Army to prepare for combat.
[00:08:52.523 --> 00:08:55.164]  As a measure against possible hostile U.S.
[00:08:55.324 --> 00:09:03.125]  action in the South China Sea after an international tribunal ruled that Beijing had no exclusive control over the area.
[00:09:03.425 --> 00:09:13.768]  The Permanent Court of Arbitration said that there was no evidence that China had historically exercised exclusive control over the waters or resources, reports the BBC.
[00:09:14.088 --> 00:09:19.029]  China responded by labeling the ruling ill-founded and refused to be bound by it.
[00:09:19.369 --> 00:09:23.353]  However, behind the scenes, the Chinese President fears that the U.S.
[00:09:23.393 --> 00:09:31.340]  could seize on the ruling to justify aggressive military maneuvers in the area and has ordered PLA forces to prepare for war.
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.023]  China's Navy has repeatedly issued warnings to U.S.
[00:09:35.043 --> 00:09:37.505]  surveillance planes flying over the region.
[00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:43.669]  In more domestic news, people are feeling the burn, but not in the way that they did earlier this year.
[00:09:43.689 --> 00:09:48.471]  They're feeling burned by Bernie Sanders with his endorsement of Madame Clinton.
[00:09:48.952 --> 00:09:58.257]  And we see that people are taking to Twitter, they're taking to their social media platforms to say, I am so disappointed that Bernie Sanders sold out millions and many of us fell for it.
[00:09:58.597 --> 00:10:00.738]  One former fan tweeted, never again.
[00:10:01.258 --> 00:10:03.219]  Personally, I don't think I will support Hillary.
[00:10:03.579 --> 00:10:05.680]  I don't trust her, a Sanders fan told Fortune.
[00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:09.744]  I can't see myself backing someone I don't believe in.
[00:10:09.824 --> 00:10:11.965]  And it goes on and on from there.
[00:10:12.226 --> 00:10:16.649]  Because if you guys recall, Bernie Sanders was supposed to be the guy who was anti-establishment.
[00:10:16.669 --> 00:10:23.976]  He's gonna come in and he's gonna bust up the banks and he's not like these other career politicians who got all the dirt and the skeletons in the closet.
[00:10:24.276 --> 00:10:29.020]  And then he turns around and he endorses the person who has all the dirt and the skeletons in the closet.
[00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:42.435]  I'm not a Sanders supporter, nor was I ever, but I did like him more than Mrs. Clinton because, in a very similar way to Obama, I wanted to believe in what he was saying and what his intentions were.
[00:10:42.595 --> 00:10:46.660]  You know, because people always say, you know, he says he's going to do this, he says he wants to do that.
[00:10:47.489 --> 00:10:49.289]  Look at the presidents throughout history.
[00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:55.631]  Even if they really wanted to do all the things they said in their campaign speeches, how many of those things did they actually accomplish?
[00:10:55.651 --> 00:10:57.571]  Just look at Obama, for example.
[00:10:57.591 --> 00:10:59.411]  He said he's going to shut down Guantanamo Bay.
[00:10:59.511 --> 00:11:01.832]  Guantanamo Bay is still well and open.
[00:11:01.852 --> 00:11:03.712]  He said he's going to end these foreign conflicts.
[00:11:04.032 --> 00:11:05.513]  Foreign conflicts are still going on.
[00:11:05.573 --> 00:11:09.773]  He said he's going to repeal the Patriot Act, or at least not re-sign the Patriot Act.
[00:11:09.813 --> 00:11:12.934]  He re-signed the Patriot Act, threw in the NDAA for good measure.
[00:11:13.394 --> 00:11:14.115]  I don't know.
[00:11:27.916 --> 00:11:33.157]  If I wanted to believe Bernie Sanders could actually do these things, it doesn't mean he'd actually get them done.
[00:11:33.177 --> 00:11:36.798]  But to see him endorse Hillary Clinton, I'm really not a fan of that.
[00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:40.800]  I would have much preferred him just rode off into the sunset, did his own thing.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.681]  He's an old guy, but maybe he could have ran again in the next election cycle, but who knows.
[00:11:46.241 --> 00:11:49.683]  I think he's pretty much scorched the earth with his own supporters at this point.
[00:11:49.964 --> 00:11:54.767]  So if he did want to come out for another run, he pretty much shot himself in the foot.
[00:11:55.147 --> 00:12:02.432]  But as we're talking about all things Clinton, let's talk about the FBI Director Comey and his decision not to prosecute Clinton.
[00:12:02.772 --> 00:12:08.817]  And we have this article from Curt Nemo who dictates how the FBI boss is connected to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:12:09.537 --> 00:12:18.819]  On Monday, Republicans sent a letter demanding to know why Comey didn't recommend federal charges against Hillary Clinton over her use of private email servers.
[00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:23.440]  Clinton clearly placed our nation's secrets in peril, the letter states.
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:29.801]  The letter also mentions emails deleted by Clinton and forensically recovered by the FBI.
[00:12:30.301 --> 00:12:33.502]  They want to know if the emails had anything to do with the Clinton Foundation.
[00:12:34.704 --> 00:12:41.766]  Comey did not recommend federal charges in part because he is connected to the Clinton Foundation through HSBC.
[00:12:42.186 --> 00:12:46.267]  Comey was appointed director of HSBC Holdings in March 2013.
[00:12:46.467 --> 00:12:56.870]  Now once again, when we think about Bernie Sanders, he's going to bust up the big banks, he's not the career politician, he's not like all these other guys, he's an outsider, he's for you, he's going to fight
[00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:20.228]  The 1%, he's going to do all this stuff, he's going to give you free college and all the rest of it, and then he comes back and backs Mrs. Clinton, who wants to be in good company with the big banks, who's being funded by the big banks, who has all the things, who is exactly the opposite on paper, so we're told, of a Bernie Sanders, and now he's supporting her just to support the party line.
[00:13:20.708 --> 00:13:22.309]  This isn't the type of guy that
[00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.391]  I'd want to support.
[00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:26.672]  And this is why I realized this so many months ago.
[00:13:26.692 --> 00:13:31.095]  I was like, well, you know, I don't think he's all that much different.
[00:13:31.135 --> 00:13:32.696]  Yeah, he can say all the talking points.
[00:13:32.716 --> 00:13:37.138]  He can go after his niche type of audience, the young college students, all this.
[00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:40.821]  But at the end of the day, I think he's a career politician like any of these other guys.
[00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:42.862]  And that's exactly what the guy turned out to be.
[00:13:42.882 --> 00:13:47.305]  He showed his true colors in a similar way that Ted Cruz did many months ago.
[00:13:47.325 --> 00:13:47.825]  Now we see
[00:13:49.326 --> 00:13:56.411]  Mr. Sanders coming out and supporting Hillary Clinton, not saying let's go after her for the emails, even though he had previously mentioned that in his debates with her.
[00:13:56.431 --> 00:13:57.652]  We need to talk about the emails.
[00:13:57.672 --> 00:13:59.053]  We need to look at some of these other things.
[00:13:59.513 --> 00:14:04.336]  And now at the end of the day, when the rubber hits the road, he's willing to back his party no matter what.
[00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:10.600]  And this is my issue with political parties here in the United States of America, because people ask me, are you Republican?
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.401]  Are you Democrat?
[00:14:11.461 --> 00:14:12.281]  Are you Libertarian?
[00:14:12.681 --> 00:14:19.665]  My views are more Libertarian in nature, but I don't support any one party because I don't want to be, you know, that straight ticket guy.
[00:14:19.725 --> 00:14:26.690]  I don't want to vote for a party or support a party just because I'm registered that on my voting log.
[00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:34.214]  That doesn't make sense to me because I don't want to back some guy that I don't believe in or back a policy that I don't believe in just because they write it on their ticket.
[00:14:34.614 --> 00:14:38.235]  If you want to be a true ex, you have to agree with everything that's on this list.
[00:14:38.255 --> 00:14:39.655]  Well, I don't agree with that, that, that.
[00:14:39.895 --> 00:14:40.795]  Well, you can't be in our club.
[00:14:40.956 --> 00:14:42.036]  Fine, I won't be in your club.
[00:14:42.276 --> 00:14:44.196]  You go run your club the way you want to.
[00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:45.877]  I'm not going to participate in this.
[00:14:46.197 --> 00:14:47.877]  I'm going to be like George Carl in this election.
[00:14:47.917 --> 00:14:49.618]  I'm going to sit back, watch everybody else wreck the country.
[00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:50.958]  I'm going to say, this was your fault.
[00:14:51.258 --> 00:14:52.218]  I had nothing to do with it.
[00:14:52.538 --> 00:14:54.979]  And this guy sent me something on Twitter a few months ago.
[00:14:56.022 --> 00:14:56.262]  I think.
[00:15:16.266 --> 00:15:19.047]  I don't like this guy, but I'm going to vote for this guy because he's in my party.
[00:15:19.087 --> 00:15:21.929]  I don't like her, but I'm going to vote for her because she's in my party.
[00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:29.213]  And at the end of the day, you get these guys who are handpicked by the same elites, or selected by the same elites, who have pretty much the same agendas.
[00:15:29.473 --> 00:15:32.354]  You look at people in the Democratic Party or the Republican Party.
[00:15:32.594 --> 00:15:36.496]  You see Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton who are being funded by the same people.
[00:15:36.516 --> 00:15:40.138]  Do you really think the people at the top really care who gets into the election?
[00:15:40.558 --> 00:15:41.219]  I don't think so.
[00:15:41.539 --> 00:15:45.361]  They have their hands in each pocket, and you can debate to an extent Trump.
[00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:52.027]  I do think the guy's a little bit different, but at the same time, he's not somebody I'd write home about and put all my faith in personally.
[00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:54.930]  But continuing on, we're going to talk about some more Clinton news.
[00:15:55.491 --> 00:16:07.223]  The Attorney General Lynch has defended her social chat with Bill Clinton and has refused to comment on facts of the investigation, but decided to, some time ago, to rubber stamp the FBI decision.
[00:16:08.109 --> 00:16:10.011]  Now this is a classic conflict of interest.
[00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:11.552]  I give the example of jury duty.
[00:16:11.932 --> 00:16:17.697]  If you get selected for jury duty and you go in to the courthouse and they say, hey, do you know person X?
[00:16:17.737 --> 00:16:21.020]  And you say, yeah, I know person X. You know, we hang out, we talk about our kids, we talk about sports.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.582]  They say, excuse me, sir, you're let go.
[00:16:23.642 --> 00:16:24.703]  We don't want you on our jury.
[00:16:24.963 --> 00:16:26.965]  You're not a fair and impartial juror.
[00:16:27.405 --> 00:16:28.146]  Meanwhile, you have a
[00:16:28.706 --> 00:16:34.550]  The Attorney General of the United States of America, who's ready to rub her stamp, and she's good friends with the Clintons.
[00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:39.033]  The fact that they can sit around and talk about their grandchildren, that is a blatant conflict of interest.
[00:16:39.353 --> 00:16:45.037]  Moving quickly now, I want to talk about some of the recent shootings that happened here in the United States of America.
[00:16:45.377 --> 00:16:51.762]  And in particular, a certain actor, and when I say this, I'm not blaming this actor, I'm just using him as a bellwether, as an example.
[00:16:52.142 --> 00:16:55.286]  He came out and he blamed the NRA for the Michigan courthouse shooting.
[00:16:55.306 --> 00:17:01.113]  If you guys don't recall, two bailiffs got shot on Monday, or two bailiffs were murdered on Monday.
[00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:02.034]  Other people were shot.
[00:17:02.094 --> 00:17:07.801]  And basically, this was an inmate who stole a gun from a police officer, just like the guy who tried to kill Donald Trump.
[00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:09.242]  He stole a firearm.
[00:17:10.103 --> 00:17:15.744]  And then the tweets come out and the guy, the celebrity is saying, hey, we need to ban the guns.
[00:17:15.764 --> 00:17:16.705]  It's the NRA's fault.
[00:17:16.825 --> 00:17:17.345]  F the NRA.
[00:17:17.365 --> 00:17:20.786]  And people said, oh, this guy stole a gun, just like the guy who tried to kill Trump.
[00:17:21.046 --> 00:17:24.867]  Which is to say, yeah, you can get your guns legally if you're a United States citizen.
[00:17:24.887 --> 00:17:26.967]  You don't have a criminal record and all of that.
[00:17:27.207 --> 00:17:34.649]  But at the same time, at the end of the day, if a criminal wants to get a gun, they are willing to steal a gun from an active duty, conscious police officer.
[00:17:35.149 --> 00:17:39.872]  That, you know, banning guns isn't going to lessen crime in the United States of America.
[00:17:40.213 --> 00:17:47.598]  People may use a different weapon to commit their crime, but they're still going to steal guns if they have to, if that's what they have to do to accomplish their goals.
[00:17:48.058 --> 00:17:50.120]  And now, real quickly, this is a sign of the times.
[00:17:51.411 --> 00:17:57.414]  People are so out of touch, they actually think that a porn star is about to become the Prime Minister over in the UK.
[00:17:57.895 --> 00:18:03.838]  And this is the British lawmaker, Theresa May, and not the adult actress, as many people confused her with being.
[00:18:03.898 --> 00:18:06.700]  It's somewhat of a funny article, and you can read that at your leisure.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.601]  But finally tonight, I'm going to warn you guys about Pokemon Go.
[00:18:09.821 --> 00:18:17.046]  Now, I'm not as critical about the app as some other people are, but just basically so you know, people are taking advantage of the app to rob you.
[00:18:17.106 --> 00:18:20.648]  So you have people looking around their phones, going into the woods, hey, I'm going to get some Pokemon.
[00:18:21.308 --> 00:18:24.970]  You'll catch a bonk to the head because they got robbed by people who set them up over the app.
[00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.111]  So just something for you to know as we go into our next segment.
[00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:31.273]  So stay tuned right after this break for more special reports.
[00:18:46.087 --> 00:18:48.669]  This is an American President.
[00:18:49.009 --> 00:18:50.150]  Just add Puppet.
[00:18:50.511 --> 00:18:52.832]  Then vote and repeat every four years.
[00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:08.885]  These were the chaotic scenes as residents of a city in Southeastern Venezuela went on the rampage in search of basic food items.
[00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:15.570]  People desperate for staples like milk, rice and flour stormed a supermarket warehouse in Guayana City.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:25.502]  If you go back to 2007, the British Ministry of Defense came out and echoed a Department of Defense report from here in the U.S.
[00:19:25.542 --> 00:19:37.084]  saying that beginning in the year 2016, right through 2020 to 2030, that they believe there would be massive multi-hundred percent food price increases worldwide.
[00:19:37.944 --> 00:19:45.926]  And that during that global meltdown, that there would be incredible social unrest that would depopulate much of the Earth.
[00:19:46.957 --> 00:19:58.285]  Now, in 2016, Vice Magazine and other publications are reporting on a 2015 report produced by the U.S.
[00:19:58.325 --> 00:20:11.134]  government, the U.N., and scores of foreign nations, as well as the State Department, overseen by food giant Cargill, the World Bank, and most importantly, the World Wildlife Fund.
[00:20:11.815 --> 00:20:12.796]  The World Wildlife Fund
[00:20:13.616 --> 00:20:21.863]  is a eugenics anti-human organization set up by Prince Bernhard who also founded the Bilderberg Group and who was a Nazi officer.
[00:20:22.524 --> 00:20:36.556]  This organization sells environmentalism to make the elite look like heroes saving the earth when in truth they are ushering in a planetary tyranny that is irrevocably damaging the fabric of our planet.
[00:20:37.096 --> 00:20:38.658]  In this new FEMA report
[00:20:39.602 --> 00:20:46.185]  With headline, FEMA contractor predicts social unrest caused by 395% food price spikes.
[00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:59.130]  You learn that this is a report filed with governments and major institutions overseen by a contractor that since the 1940s has been the main advisor for the U.S.
[00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.211]  Navy Marine Corps.
[00:21:00.987 --> 00:21:05.932]  The challenges and crises that we were assigned are exactly what we expect to see in the future.
[00:21:05.992 --> 00:21:06.973]  So you've got famine.
[00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:08.535]  You've got increased pests.
[00:21:08.615 --> 00:21:10.156]  Food prices are going up 400%.
[00:21:11.177 --> 00:21:13.039]  We've got a flood of migrants coming in.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.701]  The world is starting to fall apart.
[00:21:15.021 --> 00:21:17.824]  Everything we do is going to have some negative effect.
[00:21:18.565 --> 00:21:23.270]  Now, all of this said, governments and corporations and institutions
[00:21:23.757 --> 00:21:25.278]  Are stockpiling food and weapons.
[00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:26.059]  They're digging in.
[00:21:26.079 --> 00:21:26.860]  They're getting bunkers.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.484]  Elites are fleeing to places like New Zealand en masse.
[00:21:31.644 --> 00:21:44.896]  We've gone from financial meltdown and huge regional wars being a possibility to being a probability to more and more becoming an inevitability.
[00:21:46.058 --> 00:21:48.720]  Now, the big question is, what are we going to do about it?
[00:21:49.704 --> 00:21:53.987]  The advice I give you is the same advice that I carry out in my own personal life.
[00:21:55.728 --> 00:21:58.449]  Number one, everybody needs to be able to protect themselves.
[00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:01.351]  Everybody needs friends and family they can rely on in crises.
[00:22:01.971 --> 00:22:06.014]  And everyone needs high quality storable foods and high quality water filtration systems.
[00:22:06.614 --> 00:22:08.495]  Not just for collapse when it comes to water filters.
[00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:13.438]  All the garbage in our water, you'd be insane to drink well water or tap water with the glyphosates and all the rest of it.
[00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:18.561]  But we're offering the biggest wide spectrum sale ever on preparedness items.
[00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:23.671]  That's the lowest savings to 40% at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:31.535]  On Infowars Select, high quality storable foods, the highest quality, the lowest prices, powered by My Patriot Supply.
[00:22:31.555 --> 00:22:33.876]  We also sell their food as well, their full spectrum.
[00:22:34.216 --> 00:22:36.818]  And all of their water filtration systems across the board.
[00:22:37.158 --> 00:22:42.861]  From gravity fed systems like Alexa Pure and Pro Pure, to shower filters, to survival straws,
[00:22:43.328 --> 00:22:49.532]  You name it, it's all 20-40% off right through July 4th at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:22:50.113 --> 00:22:51.814]  I know, I personally am getting prepared.
[00:22:52.374 --> 00:22:53.755]  The warning signs are insane.
[00:22:54.255 --> 00:23:00.700]  Take advantage, 20-40% off until early next week with the 4th of July Holiday Special at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:23:09.747 --> 00:23:18.232]  Attorney General Loretta Lynch was on the Hill today in front of the House Judiciary Committee at an oversight hearing on Justice Department operations.
[00:23:18.592 --> 00:23:25.837]  Regarding those operations, Attorney General Lynch stonewalled the committee with non-answers and legal diversion.
[00:23:25.877 --> 00:23:33.321]  Director Comey stated that there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information.
[00:23:33.902 --> 00:23:36.103]  Do you agree with Director Comey's statement?
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.143]  Again, I would refer you to Director Comey for any further explanation as to the basis for his recommendations.
[00:23:42.524 --> 00:23:49.028]  The recommendation that I received from the team, including Director Comey, was that the investigation be resolved without charges.
[00:23:49.048 --> 00:23:59.755]  General Lynch, Director Comey made a recommendation, but he made a recommendation to the Department of Justice, which you had, and you would have to come to the final conclusion on whether or not to act.
[00:23:59.915 --> 00:24:06.880]  I would presume that before you acted, you would look at his conclusions and determine whether you agreed with them or not.
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.584]  Meanwhile, the Democrats used the opportunity to promote gun control.
[00:24:11.684 --> 00:24:19.610]  There is an epidemic of gun violence and that was the majority in Congress responded with emergency hearings about Hillary Clinton's and Lois Lerner's emails.
[00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:28.658]  Democratic Congressman Hank Johnson weighed in on the Democrats' perception that the hearings were unimportant to the protection of national security.
[00:24:28.938 --> 00:24:31.560]  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't.
[00:24:31.981 --> 00:24:35.364]  It's they're just tone deaf and they insist
[00:24:36.124 --> 00:24:46.228]  On chasing rabbits down holes by trying to make some hay out of something that is, this is over with.
[00:24:46.428 --> 00:24:50.830]  You may remember Johnson once expressed concern over Guam tipping over.
[00:24:51.090 --> 00:25:01.514]  The whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.
[00:25:04.283 --> 00:25:05.705]  We don't anticipate that.
[00:25:18.442 --> 00:25:36.672]  When you have a conversation with the former president, the husband of the subject of an ongoing investigation, and you have that conversation before they've interviewed the subject, and before they've reached their recommendations and finished their investigation, that's what triggered you to do this thing you've never done before, which is announce, I don't care what they recommend, I'm gonna follow it.
[00:25:37.113 --> 00:25:43.915]  My concern was that the conversation that I had with President Clinton would be seen by some as having an influence over that.
[00:25:44.075 --> 00:25:48.396]  I felt it was important to clarify.
[00:25:48.456 --> 00:25:56.899]  But now, as Kurt Nimmo writes, FBI Director James Comey's past and present employment as director of HSBC's holdings
[00:25:57.159 --> 00:26:10.829]  And subsequent promotion to independent non-executive director and a member of the Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee, an appointment set to expire this year, clearly has blatant ties to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:26:11.009 --> 00:26:25.460]  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia and Committee Member Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina want to know if the emails that were deleted and recovered by the FBI had anything to do with the Clinton Foundation.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:45.869]  The Mexican drug cartel money laundering Swiss bank, HSBC, is connected to the Clinton Foundation through a number of initiatives, including its Building the Corporate Coalition, investing in management and leadership in Vietnam, and other American economy-destroying free trade agreement projects.
[00:26:46.169 --> 00:26:53.413]  Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, and a number of transnational corporations also participate.
[00:26:53.593 --> 00:26:56.975]  The Clintons have used the foundation to enrich themselves.
[00:26:57.275 --> 00:27:12.963]  Documents disclosed through litigation by Judicial Watch provided a roadmap for over 200 conflict of interest rulings that led to at least $48 million in speaking fees for the Clintons during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.
[00:27:13.123 --> 00:27:19.985]  Hillary Clinton and her aides were involved in fundraising for the foundation, and she turned the State Department into the D.C.
[00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:24.706]  office of the Clinton Foundation, something she will now do to the White House.
[00:27:25.087 --> 00:27:31.669]  What will it take to convince every American citizen that they are being scammed at the highest levels?
[00:27:32.109 --> 00:27:36.450]  In my next report, I will be digging into Comey's involvement into Whitewater.
[00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:40.696]  Comey's protection of the Clinton corruption machine goes way back.
[00:27:41.117 --> 00:27:43.140]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:27:48.547 --> 00:27:59.513]  Since Bernie Sanders came out and announced his candidacy for the President of the United States, he began to hit Hillary Clinton hard, labeling her as one of the most corrupt politicians America has ever seen.
[00:27:59.893 --> 00:28:05.376]  The fact that she took money from Goldman Sachs, the fact that she is the Queen of Wall Street.
[00:28:05.756 --> 00:28:11.279]  Let's take a look at a few clips that prove what Bernie Sanders said about her connections with Wall Street.
[00:28:11.779 --> 00:28:15.021]  Secretary Clinton has a number of super PACs.
[00:28:21.201 --> 00:28:31.904]  One of her super PACs recently reported that they raised $25 million from special interest, $15 million from Wall Street alone.
[00:28:31.924 --> 00:28:36.826]  I don't take money from big banks.
[00:28:38.027 --> 00:28:41.189]  I don't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs.
[00:28:41.469 --> 00:28:42.310]  Here's the story.
[00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:44.351]  I mean, you know, let's not be naive about it.
[00:28:44.831 --> 00:28:54.757]  I have never heard a candidate, never, who has received huge amounts of money from oil, from coal, from Wall Street, from the military industrial complex.
[00:28:55.057 --> 00:28:59.760]  Not one candidate said, oh, these campaign contributions will not influence me.
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.121]  I'm going to be independent.
[00:29:01.661 --> 00:29:05.610]  Well, why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions?
[00:29:06.252 --> 00:29:07.515]  They expect to get something.
[00:29:07.575 --> 00:29:08.296]  Everybody knows that.
[00:29:13.399 --> 00:29:14.360]  Impugn my integrity.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.341]  Let's be frank here.
[00:29:15.421 --> 00:29:16.942]  Oh, wait a minute, Senator.
[00:29:17.102 --> 00:29:26.329]  Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided, spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?
[00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:30.213]  Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence.
[00:29:30.573 --> 00:29:32.935]  One of us has a super PAC.
[00:29:34.976 --> 00:29:41.702]  One of us has raised $15 million from Wall Street for that super PAC.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:48.422]  One of us has given speeches on Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:29:49.583 --> 00:29:55.746]  Now I kind of think if you get paid a couple of hundred thousand dollars for a speech, it must be a great speech.
[00:29:56.806 --> 00:30:01.228]  I think we should release it and let the American people see what that transcript was.
[00:30:02.819 --> 00:30:17.191]  Every candidate in the history of the world, Democrat, Republican, when they receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street or the drug companies or the fossil fuel industries, what they always say, not going to impact me.
[00:30:17.211 --> 00:30:27.059]  And our question is, if it's not going to impact their decisions, why would Wall Street be spending $15 million?
[00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:41.054]  I don't think that you are qualified if you get $15 million from Wall Street through your super PAC.
[00:30:41.534 --> 00:30:48.618]  I don't think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in Iraq.
[00:30:48.899 --> 00:30:56.623]  I have come here to make it as clear as possible as to why I am endorsing Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:58.619 --> 00:31:07.122]  And I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next President of the United States.
[00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.251]  And there you have it.
[00:31:09.551 --> 00:31:15.155]  Bernie Sanders has now endorsed the most corrupt politician in American history.
[00:31:15.455 --> 00:31:16.816]  And it's been leading up to this point.
[00:31:16.836 --> 00:31:17.617]  We should have seen it.
[00:31:17.997 --> 00:31:22.661]  The fact that on the first debate, one of the questions were about Hillary Clinton's emails.
[00:31:23.041 --> 00:31:23.722]  And what did he do?
[00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:24.762]  Enough is enough.
[00:31:24.782 --> 00:31:26.924]  Let's stop talking about Hillary's emails.
[00:31:26.984 --> 00:31:31.367]  The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.
[00:31:31.488 --> 00:31:31.888]  Thank you.
[00:31:32.108 --> 00:31:32.588]  Me too.
[00:31:32.788 --> 00:31:33.049]  Me too.
[00:31:36.648 --> 00:31:37.689]  That's out of control.
[00:31:37.949 --> 00:31:41.332]  That set the tone for what we saw in the past few days.
[00:31:41.632 --> 00:31:46.216]  The fact that the FBI Director Comey came out and basically said, what difference does it make?
[00:31:46.657 --> 00:31:48.038]  She didn't know that that was bad.
[00:31:48.458 --> 00:31:53.422]  The fact that Loretta Lynch is ducking and dodging questions right now in Capitol Hill about this.
[00:31:53.683 --> 00:31:59.808]  Here you have the most anti-establishment candidate in Bernie Sanders now folding.
[00:32:00.796 --> 00:32:02.877]  To the Queen of Wall Street, Hillary Clinton.
[00:32:03.237 --> 00:32:04.037]  It's a sad day.
[00:32:04.818 --> 00:32:07.699]  But now we can all turn our faces to a brighter future.
[00:32:08.139 --> 00:32:09.560]  Let's make America great again.
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:15.963]  I want to see each and every one of you come out to the RNC and DNC wearing one of these t-shirts right here.
[00:32:16.343 --> 00:32:17.283]  Hillary for prison.
[00:32:17.503 --> 00:32:19.204]  Show your disapproval for her today.
[00:32:19.644 --> 00:32:21.805]  Go to the InfoWars store and get yours.
[00:32:22.066 --> 00:32:27.308]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com and I just want to say, Sanders is a sellout.
[00:32:37.577 --> 00:32:45.365]  We celebrate the 4th of July as a reminder of earning our independence from a tyrannical and oppressive government.
[00:32:45.585 --> 00:32:52.132]  Just a reminder to the Obama administration, there's plenty of room on the calendar for another holiday.
[00:33:02.332 --> 00:33:08.278]  People desperate for staples like milk, rice and flour stormed a supermarket warehouse in Guayana City.
[00:33:09.079 --> 00:33:23.494]  If you go back to 2007, the British Ministry of Defense came out and echoed a Department of Defense report saying that they believe there would be massive multi-hundred percent food price increases worldwide.
[00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:32.382]  And that during that global meltdown that there would be incredible social unrest that would depopulate much of the earth.
[00:33:32.582 --> 00:33:42.131]  Now, Vice Magazine and other publications are reporting on a 2015 report produced by the US government, the UN.
[00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:43.031]  Cut!
[00:33:43.452 --> 00:33:44.372]  We'll stop it right there.
[00:33:45.173 --> 00:33:48.256]  I shot that video, that special, about a week and a half ago.
[00:33:48.536 --> 00:33:55.024]  Before Hillary Clinton was basically given free reign in the United States of America to break any law she wants.
[00:33:55.404 --> 00:34:01.711]  Before more news came out of food riots intensifying in Asia, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, you name it.
[00:34:02.272 --> 00:34:06.597]  Before we got more news of NATO plans to encircle Russia with more troops.
[00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:11.640]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, the world financial economy is melting down by design.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:16.462]  Everything the globalists are doing is about making us dependent on them.
[00:34:17.183 --> 00:34:31.169]  That's why, declaring personal independence, I am announcing that we're extending the record sales of 20-40% off on water filters and X2 survival shield and, of course, the survival food.
[00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:35.972]  I'm extending the 20-40% off for one more week, and then that's it.
[00:34:36.792 --> 00:34:52.546]  But I'm expanding it when it comes to non-GMO heirloom seeds, all sorts of systems to jump your car or to give yourself power during emergencies, and on solar panel systems, and on shortwave radios that are solar powered and crank powered.
[00:34:52.966 --> 00:35:01.794]  So we're going from a few dozen items that are discounted to more than a hundred right now at InfoWarsStore.com, and we're running it right
[00:35:02.094 --> 00:35:04.755]  Through to the beginning of next week.
[00:35:05.075 --> 00:35:12.038]  It is the biggest sale ever on preparedness and survival systems because the globalists want us totally dependent on them.
[00:35:12.058 --> 00:35:15.279]  We need to be independent ourselves, or at least start that journey.
[00:35:15.639 --> 00:35:18.740]  But there's another aspect of this that makes it an absolute no-brainer.
[00:35:19.521 --> 00:35:30.105]  When you get the high-quality non-GMO seeds, open-pollinated heirloom, when you get high-quality water filtration systems, massively discounted, or nutraceuticals, when you get high-quality storable foods,
[00:35:30.925 --> 00:35:32.954]  You're not just making yourself more independent.
[00:35:34.096 --> 00:35:42.160]  You're also funding InfoWars that is just breaking international news every day and really giving the globalists a major run for their money.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:47.542]  So you don't just get great prices, you don't just support the InfoWars, you support yourself and your family at the same time.
[00:35:47.842 --> 00:35:48.963]  It's an absolute no-brainer.
[00:35:48.983 --> 00:35:53.104]  I want to thank all of you that have come to InfoWarsStore.com and who have supported what we're doing.
[00:35:53.324 --> 00:35:55.986]  And I want to encourage those of you that haven't, check it out today.
[00:35:56.386 --> 00:36:00.608]  It's a total 360 win at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:36:01.568 --> 00:36:09.430]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.751]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:36:11.911 --> 00:36:14.532]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:36:14.612 --> 00:36:18.713]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:36:19.033 --> 00:36:22.174]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:36:22.194 --> 00:36:29.456]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:36:29.656 --> 00:36:33.780]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.621]  We are the true media.
[00:36:35.781 --> 00:36:38.384]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:36:38.484 --> 00:36:42.127]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:36:42.227 --> 00:36:46.350]  Join us at InfoWarsNews.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:49.413]  Members can share their memberships with up to 11 people.
[00:36:49.533 --> 00:36:52.636]  By subscribing, you will literally be buying war bonds.
[00:36:52.916 --> 00:36:53.697]  It's called augmented reality.
[00:37:11.198 --> 00:37:20.905]  I thought humans interfacing with this incredible third dimension, having sight, having smell, having taste, having touch, having emotions and feelings inside our hearts.
[00:37:21.385 --> 00:37:23.506]  I thought that was augmented reality.
[00:37:23.546 --> 00:37:25.488]  I thought that was consciousness.
[00:37:26.268 --> 00:37:28.670]  But now we're told it's the number one search.
[00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.171]  Five, six days running.
[00:37:30.611 --> 00:37:31.652]  Pokemon Go.
[00:37:32.252 --> 00:37:35.495]  In fact, some of the amazing crew members and our own officer playing it.
[00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:39.477]  And I'm not judging them for checking out something new and interesting.
[00:37:39.877 --> 00:37:42.960]  My kids have played Pokemon, you know, the card game, years ago.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.503]  You have these little monsters that you play against each other.
[00:37:45.523 --> 00:37:49.446]  You've got to go find the monsters, capture them, train them, all the rest of it.
[00:37:49.546 --> 00:37:49.847]  Whatever.
[00:37:49.907 --> 00:37:51.188]  Board games have been around.
[00:37:51.668 --> 00:37:53.510]  Chess games have been around 3-4 thousand years.
[00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:53.971]  That's great.
[00:37:55.185 --> 00:38:10.790]  The problem is, is that we see more and more people living in second life, buying Ferraris with real money that don't really exist, forming fake relationships in cyberspace and becoming very unsuccessful in the real world.
[00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:32.371]  And we see the social engineers pushing as hard as they can to get people to tune out of the real world, this incredible planet hurtling through space, and our amazing moon, and all the other things that are happening on our planet, and dial into artificial systems created by Nintendo.
[00:38:33.516 --> 00:38:37.779]  Or by Microsoft, or by Google, or by Apple.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:51.329]  They are creating the universes in which we interface, instead of humans living in the real universe and being creative, sentient beings yourself.
[00:38:52.372 --> 00:38:59.557]  They are building false realities into which they want to induct you so they can play God.
[00:39:00.377 --> 00:39:08.802]  So I'm not saying anybody's bad who wants to play video games or who wants to be involved in World of Warcraft or any of that.
[00:39:09.363 --> 00:39:11.704]  All I'm saying is the metrics are there.
[00:39:11.724 --> 00:39:13.505]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:39:14.486 --> 00:39:16.668]  The screen time is lowering our IQs.
[00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:19.491]  Our synapses are collapsing.
[00:39:20.251 --> 00:39:22.133]  Humanity is in crisis.
[00:39:22.653 --> 00:39:25.176]  And Pokemon Go is illustrating my own fact.
[00:39:26.257 --> 00:39:35.124]  Ambulance drivers, EMTs, across not just the U.S., but the world, are saying that suddenly, because there's augmented reality, kids that have never been outside their house
[00:39:35.916 --> 00:39:36.256]  That's right.
[00:39:54.121 --> 00:40:03.244]  That's what Microsoft and others have said they want for decades, is to have every real area of the world with this whole data list and this whole information cube around it to track what you do.
[00:40:04.185 --> 00:40:11.247]  But in a way it's actually backfiring as people go out into the real world themselves looking for the false reality.
[00:40:12.128 --> 00:40:20.451]  But I can't get over the image of brain-dead zombies that we see on TV walking, looking at their phones, going into traffic,
[00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:36.449]  I can't help but think about the images of people that walk into fountains at malls or that drive off cliffs while they're watching their GPFs or drive into raging rivers because they're making this their entire consciousness.
[00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:39.132]  I mean, I'm out here supposedly
[00:40:40.211 --> 00:40:43.773]  at a nearby golf course looking for one of these Pokemons.
[00:40:43.793 --> 00:40:51.999]  And I'm told that it's magically laid some eggs about a hundred yards over there and that I can go over there and watch it hatch and capture it for myself.
[00:40:52.519 --> 00:40:53.960]  But in truth, it's not really there.
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.641]  It's being geo-located.
[00:40:56.342 --> 00:40:57.022]  I'm being tracked.
[00:40:57.062 --> 00:41:01.025]  Everything I'm doing, by the way, by the SAP admits it's been hacking millions of people's phones.
[00:41:01.705 --> 00:41:09.871]  And I'm now feeding this data to the matrix of where I am and what I'm doing to find some mythical projection that it's shooting onto my phone.
[00:41:11.071 --> 00:41:20.736]  Again, this is giving all of my personal privacy, all of my personal power over to Nintendo to sell my habits, to sell my behaviors, to sell my data to whoever they want.
[00:41:21.917 --> 00:41:23.278]  The studies don't lie.
[00:41:23.878 --> 00:41:25.139]  This dehumanizes you.
[00:41:25.759 --> 00:41:29.261]  This ends up destroying your humanity in the final equation.
[00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:31.642]  If you use it in limited amounts,
[00:41:33.217 --> 00:41:34.077]  Sure, it's interesting.
[00:41:34.117 --> 00:41:35.758]  You can meet like-minded people that are into it.
[00:41:36.118 --> 00:41:37.219]  I'm not judging anybody.
[00:41:37.279 --> 00:41:37.879]  Lord knows.
[00:41:38.419 --> 00:41:46.862]  I'm just simply pointing out we should ask ourselves why Pokémon has been more popular the last five, six days than porn.
[00:41:47.822 --> 00:41:55.185]  When I heard that the British exit from the Euro was more popular than porn, the only thing in years to beat that, I was proud of the people.
[00:41:55.545 --> 00:42:00.047]  Anti-globalism is number one, even above simulated procreation.
[00:42:01.223 --> 00:42:03.644]  But the truth is, porn is just like this.
[00:42:04.444 --> 00:42:05.505]  It's simulated.
[00:42:06.045 --> 00:42:06.845]  It isn't real.
[00:42:07.126 --> 00:42:19.331]  You're living through somebody else's template, somebody else's intercourse, somebody else's activities that are then edited and presented and sold to you so while they live, you sleep.
[00:42:20.191 --> 00:42:21.312]  And that's all I'm saying.
[00:42:22.302 --> 00:42:38.585]  Every study, every piece of research shows that forest bathing and getting outdoors and being in the open air and looking up at the sky raises your awareness, raises your IQ, getting in the wind, feeling the reality, seeing the birds fly around in the air.
[00:42:39.426 --> 00:42:48.714]  But I tell you, it gives sacrilege to the gamers and sacrilege to the TV heads who you get around and they don't talk about what's happening in the world.
[00:42:48.974 --> 00:42:50.796]  They don't talk about what they're doing with men or women.
[00:42:51.116 --> 00:42:52.617]  They don't talk about what they're doing with art.
[00:42:52.897 --> 00:42:55.520]  They don't talk about hiking or camping trips they're going on.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.141]  They don't care about their work.
[00:42:57.641 --> 00:42:59.203]  They don't care about the world.
[00:42:59.503 --> 00:43:02.505]  They're cynical and don't care about the New World Order on average.
[00:43:03.446 --> 00:43:19.043]  All they want to do is live in their fantasy land, and I for one am sick and tired of that, and I'm reaching into those people that are living in false worlds built by other people, built by these gaming companies that make billions of dollars off of you, that this is the ultimate form of slavery.
[00:43:19.223 --> 00:43:19.823]  And let me be clear,
[00:43:20.922 --> 00:43:22.923]  A lot of the big game companies are patriots.
[00:43:23.083 --> 00:43:25.204]  A lot of the big game companies are listeners of mine.
[00:43:25.544 --> 00:43:28.985]  My God, I've been like eight or nine big video games over the years.
[00:43:29.025 --> 00:43:31.426]  I've signed contracts and let them use my voice or image.
[00:43:31.446 --> 00:43:35.368]  And there's a lot of good messages in video games, just like movies, just like TV.
[00:43:35.768 --> 00:43:37.048]  But there's some bad messages.
[00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:44.091]  And the globalists are basically pushing this because they don't want you to be involved in the real world.
[00:43:45.432 --> 00:43:47.192]  Look, it is kind of fun.
[00:43:47.953 --> 00:43:48.693]  I'm gonna admit it.
[00:43:50.103 --> 00:43:56.945]  to just not look at the sunset over there, and not look at the sky or the moon, and just start looking at this.
[00:43:56.985 --> 00:43:58.485]  It's so much fun.
[00:43:58.525 --> 00:43:59.046]  It's so neat.
[00:43:59.066 --> 00:44:02.567]  Wait a minute, there's eggs over there.
[00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:04.427]  There's something hatching.
[00:44:04.487 --> 00:44:05.788]  Actually, this is pretty cool, guys.
[00:44:05.988 --> 00:44:06.508]  I'm into this.
[00:44:07.588 --> 00:44:09.028]  Over there, it's, oh my God.
[00:44:09.649 --> 00:44:11.229]  Oh my God, I just found a new.
[00:44:12.469 --> 00:44:13.270]  Can't you see it over there?
[00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:15.030]  It's right there, and now I can see it for myself.
[00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:17.151]  Ladies and gentlemen, right there,
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.561]  Triglypuff is the newest Pokemon.
[00:44:20.581 --> 00:44:21.261]  It's given birth.
[00:44:22.141 --> 00:44:23.322]  Triglypuff is giving birth.
[00:44:24.542 --> 00:44:26.463]  Triglypuff is giving birth to a baby.
[00:44:27.443 --> 00:44:28.984]  To a baby Darth Vader.
[00:44:30.064 --> 00:44:31.224]  It's my own fantasy land.
[00:44:31.244 --> 00:44:32.965]  I don't have to actually affect change in the real world.
[00:44:33.625 --> 00:44:36.206]  I can just believe whatever I want and be a star here.
[00:44:36.966 --> 00:44:40.488]  Oh my god.
[00:44:42.548 --> 00:44:43.729]  I've actually changed my mind.
[00:44:44.289 --> 00:44:45.989]  Now that I'm in the Matrix.
[00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:47.130]  Don't
[00:44:48.294 --> 00:44:50.755]  Look outside the television or the internet or the computer.
[00:44:52.155 --> 00:44:53.996]  Only look into this world that's real.
[00:44:54.736 --> 00:44:55.277]  This world.
[00:44:56.257 --> 00:45:00.098]  This world where you could actually create something isn't real.
[00:45:02.219 --> 00:45:12.923]  The only world that's real is the world where Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and your trusted local professors tell you what words you're allowed to use.
[00:45:14.024 --> 00:45:17.265]  So go back to your dorms and play Pokemon Go.
[00:45:18.697 --> 00:45:22.761]  And whatever you do, don't hack into Pokemon and actually create your own characters.
[00:45:23.481 --> 00:45:28.566]  Whatever you do, don't use their own memes and their own systems to wait people up.
[00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:35.632]  Just conform and pretend you were never conscious and you were never alive.
[00:45:36.052 --> 00:45:38.274]  And whatever you do, never visit.
[00:45:38.935 --> 00:45:40.496]  While the internet is still somewhat free.
[00:45:41.717 --> 00:45:42.718]  InfoWars.com.
[00:45:55.174 --> 00:45:59.916]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now.
[00:46:00.656 --> 00:46:05.519]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation, well I'll tell you how.
[00:46:06.039 --> 00:46:11.542]  When the Democrats showed their true colors, you got angry and you elected Republicans.
[00:46:12.062 --> 00:46:17.285]  And then when the Republicans showed their true colors, you got angry and elected Democrats.
[00:46:17.725 --> 00:46:27.814]  And when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side were looking out for your best interest, you acted like they were crazy.
[00:46:28.395 --> 00:46:36.102]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.
[00:46:36.602 --> 00:46:42.504]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up, America, and break the matrix.
[00:46:42.864 --> 00:46:47.806]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and the Alex Jones Show.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.264 --> 00:48:55.946]  We've seen incredible gullibility out of the Republican Party's constituents over the years.
[00:48:55.986 --> 00:48:58.788]  Just look at all the lies that George W. Bush supporters put up with.
[00:48:58.828 --> 00:49:02.590]  But I got to tell you, Democrats take the cake, especially Bernie Sanders supporters.
[00:49:22.472 --> 00:49:32.840]  He came out yesterday and said that, oh, we've realized so many of our goals and we're so victorious and now I'm throwing my support to Hillary.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:42.087]  When Hillary is the most corporate, most crony capitalist candidate out of the entire field we've seen the last two years.
[00:49:42.768 --> 00:49:46.971]  I mean, she makes Donald Trump look like the outsider he is.
[00:49:48.472 --> 00:49:51.795]  And it's so sad to see Bernie supporters who are committing
[00:49:53.001 --> 00:50:00.164]  To getting their so-called free lunch, buying into anything and everything that the Democratic Party pitches at them.
[00:50:00.824 --> 00:50:07.067]  It's so clear that the big money and the big media and all the big robber barons are lined up against Donald Trump.
[00:50:08.628 --> 00:50:16.091]  But most of the former Bernie supporters out there that are being polled are saying, Hey, we're going for Hillary.
[00:50:17.529 --> 00:50:18.530]  It's truly shameful.
[00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:34.681]  Then the corporate media that sells us all these illegal wars and all these other lies is telling us Donald Trump's an evil racist and the worst person in the world and that we all need to support Hillary because that's the best thing to do.
[00:50:34.781 --> 00:50:41.206]  And that it's good to go out and demonstrate and protest against the local police because they're corrupt.
[00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:52.033]  That's the big out-of-control federal government bought and paid for by foreign interests that militarized the police to be their enforcers.
[00:50:52.813 --> 00:51:04.577]  Now because they're concerned about an American-style Brexit out of the North American Union and globalism, they're trying to trigger the revolution that's brewing against local government and police.
[00:51:05.597 --> 00:51:07.198]  They're trying to distract the public
[00:51:08.402 --> 00:51:17.307]  At the same time, bring in a type of soft civil war where the UN can then be the honchos of the reorganization of the United States.
[00:51:18.427 --> 00:51:22.830]  Look at the riots all over the country, the police stations being shot up, the police being killed.
[00:51:24.511 --> 00:51:29.413]  Can you just walk up to police you don't even know the name of and randomly say, you deserve to die?
[00:51:30.634 --> 00:51:32.635]  And some will say, well, they do that to some citizens.
[00:51:33.776 --> 00:51:36.137]  Statistically, police killings are flat.
[00:51:37.606 --> 00:51:43.353]  Even as the crime rate has been lower for 20 years starts to go up because the economy is imploding.
[00:51:44.074 --> 00:51:49.099]  All Americans are starting to see on average their living standards go down.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.342]  We're seeing our basic freedoms under attack.
[00:51:51.402 --> 00:51:54.546]  We are collectively as a citizenry under attack.
[00:51:56.161 --> 00:52:10.905]  It was so exciting a few weeks ago to see the Brexit, which was a move against globalism, led by the Ron Paul slash Alex Jones slash Matt Drudge of Europe, Nigel Farage, to see that for days be the number one search term.
[00:52:11.785 --> 00:52:15.366]  To have more search terms than all porn terms combined.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:21.441]  There was one other search term that was also number one for a day and in the top five for an entire week.
[00:52:21.461 --> 00:52:22.401]  That was Hillary for prison.
[00:52:22.841 --> 00:52:40.624]  It shows the power of we, the populist peoples, the libertarians, the Libertas, the true liberators, the liberals, not the controllers, not the counterfeit liberals and the Republican cohorts who are trying to shackle and control this huge awakening that's taking place.
[00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:44.465]  I'm going to Cleveland in just a few days.
[00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:47.396]  I'm going to be there for the full week of the RNC.
[00:52:47.436 --> 00:52:52.540]  We're also sending a crew to the DNC and we're going to be standing up for the truth.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:57.404]  We're going to be exposing that the Republican Party has said they're still going to try to steal the nomination from Donald Trump.
[00:52:58.164 --> 00:53:01.987]  We're going to be there exposing the social justice warriors and how programmed they are.
[00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:07.894]  And we're going to be putting airplanes in the sky that point out that Hillary should be sent to prison, not the White House.
[00:53:07.914 --> 00:53:13.619]  We're going to have trucks driving around town with the same thing on the side, all because you've taken action and believed in us.
[00:53:13.699 --> 00:53:16.781]  We believed in you and the info war is having a giant effect.
[00:53:18.202 --> 00:53:27.630]  Now I've got other reports coming up today that deal with the assault on reality, the attempt to get the average person to not be politically or culturally involved.
[00:53:28.985 --> 00:53:34.969]  We're going to be looking at some of the big phenomenons in AI and augmented reality, the new Pokemon Go phenomenon and more.
[00:53:36.731 --> 00:53:41.774]  And David Knight's going to be breaking down with his guest, Anthony Guicciardi and others, the latest breaking news and taking your phone calls.
[00:53:42.875 --> 00:53:56.985]  But make no mistake, when the entire establishment and the entire media that we know are a pack of criminal liars, discredited frauds are telling us that Hillary Clinton's our Lord and Savior.
[00:53:58.613 --> 00:54:02.635]  If we really elect her, a lot of people deserve what they get.
[00:54:04.957 --> 00:54:09.059]  All I know is, I feel like America and the whole world has reached the point of overturn.
[00:54:09.759 --> 00:54:14.822]  It's not that Donald Trump is a perfect solution, but he's a protest against everything we've seen so far.
[00:54:15.763 --> 00:54:23.027]  And I hope that we can live up to what our cousins in the UK have done and
[00:54:24.218 --> 00:54:32.884]  Send out a signal in 2016 that we too are leaving corporate world government, corporate unelected globalism that was rejected in the Brexit.
[00:54:34.045 --> 00:54:35.846]  That's what a Donald Trump victory would be.
[00:54:38.048 --> 00:54:39.549]  It's time for Americans to wake up.
[00:54:39.629 --> 00:54:42.231]  It's time to make America free again.
[00:54:43.031 --> 00:54:44.993]  And that will make this country great again.
[00:54:46.496 --> 00:54:52.122]  Now we're going to go to our guest, who is Blair White, a YouTuber, transgender commentator.
[00:54:52.502 --> 00:54:56.186]  You can search Blair White on Twitter or YouTube, her account will come up.
[00:54:56.726 --> 00:55:00.130]  And again, when this goes up on YouTube, we'll put the links in the description.
[00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:02.532]  Now Blair, you posted a video
[00:55:03.433 --> 00:55:06.794]  About a week ago, I think, called Black Lives Matter is trash.
[00:55:07.515 --> 00:55:08.955]  You went straight out there with it.
[00:55:09.475 --> 00:55:11.956]  Got in people's faces, basically, with the truth, you know.
[00:55:12.496 --> 00:55:26.142]  The video talked about, and in fact we can see some of it in the background here, you talked about how these Black Lives Matter morons crashed this vigil to the Orlando massacre victims to reinforce their oppression Olympics hierarchy.
[00:55:26.562 --> 00:55:31.964]  And then you basically went through the fact that Black Lives Matter as a movement has completely failed.
[00:55:32.364 --> 00:55:35.965]  You know, we got race relations, the worst in modern history.
[00:55:36.225 --> 00:55:39.045]  We've got black people still killing each other in droves.
[00:55:39.525 --> 00:55:45.107]  Now, Black Lives Matter, the ideology is inspiring actual terrorists to go out and kill people.
[00:55:45.727 --> 00:56:01.030]  And of course, the big one for me, millions of Americans are now not even interested in police brutality or addressing it as an issue because of its association with this colossally stupid, violent and divisive Black Lives Matter movement.
[00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:03.670]  Now, you put out this video.
[00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:07.711]  Tell us what was in the video and what happened after you posted it.
[00:56:09.012 --> 00:56:23.615]  Okay, so in the video it was, I think it was at Mizzou, and it was a Black Lives Matter activist who hijacked the stage and the microphone to basically advertise Black Lives Matter racial demonstrations and say that
[00:56:24.235 --> 00:56:42.107]  The people that were there to mourn the deaths of the 49 people slain in the Orlando shooting were racists, implying that they were unintelligent because they were white, and basically just using it to push her own narrative rather than to be respectful for what it was, which was, you know, mourning 49 slain people.
[00:56:42.127 --> 00:56:43.568]  It's pretty amazing.
[00:56:44.383 --> 00:56:54.652]  And we saw the same thing in Toronto, Canada last weekend, where they hijacked this gay pride march to reinforce this oppression Olympics.
[00:56:54.692 --> 00:57:02.339]  I think there's this fear that their control of that narrative of gay people in general, of this LGBT community, which you're a member of,
[00:57:02.799 --> 00:57:02.899]  Yes.
[00:57:18.817 --> 00:57:24.079]  Above those people because again, they're starting to listen to people like you, people like me.
[00:57:24.119 --> 00:57:36.644]  I mean, after Orlando, I got so many positive messages from gay people, from LGBT people, you know, saying that they were buying guns, they were starting to watch conservative libertarian YouTube videos, they were starting to
[00:57:37.324 --> 00:57:42.610]  Think about voting for Donald Trump, because they're just sick of being told what to think by the left.
[00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:50.999]  So you posted this video, and then the peaceful Black Lives Matter group, Sally Cohn and CNN, told me it was peaceful, so I guess it is.
[00:57:51.579 --> 00:57:53.161]  They weren't too happy with it.
[00:57:53.201 --> 00:57:54.543]  Tell us what happened afterwards.
[00:57:55.479 --> 00:58:08.727]  No, you know, unlike when I make a video about, say, feminism, where you'll have like two feminists in the comment sections arguing, Black Lives Matter is actually very organized, and if they set a target, they're coming for a target.
[00:58:09.407 --> 00:58:23.296]  And basically what happened was one prominent Twitter in the Black Lives Matter, I don't know, community, shared my video, and then from there it was just like they descended, which is totally fine because I make videos to encourage, you know,
[00:58:24.256 --> 00:58:26.158]  Discourse and disagreement and everything.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.283]  But no one really challenged the ideas in my video.
[00:58:30.303 --> 00:58:33.226]  They just kind of made, you know, ad hominem attacks.
[00:58:33.326 --> 00:58:36.029]  And eventually a Twitter got a hold of me.
[00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:37.151]  They're a doxing Twitter.
[00:58:37.171 --> 00:58:45.220]  And on their timeline, they had doxed like dozens and dozens of people, including their addresses, phone numbers, other information, employers.
[00:58:46.613 --> 00:58:47.974]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.
