[00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:23.799]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.267]  It is Tuesday, February 9th, 2016, and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:28.688 --> 00:00:31.614]  And I'm David Knight, and here's a look at what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:42.410]  Tonight, the creator of the popular Dilbert cartoon series says the fix is in.
[00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:51.813]  And he predicts that the GOP will rig tonight's primary to favor the establishment puppet candidate, Marco Rubio.
[00:00:52.193 --> 00:00:56.094]  Meanwhile, Jeb Bush tries to get tough with Donald Trump.
[00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:59.616]  But as usual, it backfires on him big time.
[00:00:59.996 --> 00:01:00.516]  Please clap.
[00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:09.988]  And Barack Hussein Obama paves the way for a real Americana socialist to become president.
[00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:14.589]  The final dish by the New World Order's puppet is presented to the table.
[00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:20.530]  Live coverage of the New Hampshire primary begins right now on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.430]  InfoWars!

[00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:25.965]  Welcome back.
[00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:28.607]  Well, it is decision day in New Hampshire.
[00:03:28.727 --> 00:03:34.629]  The voters there are going to be making their choice for the president in the nation's first primary there.
[00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.192]  And, you know, opinion polls are expecting some big wins for Trump and Sanders as well.
[00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:44.474]  And, of course, we'll have to just wait and see if there will be another surprise like we saw in Iowa.
[00:03:45.054 --> 00:03:53.299]  Now myself and the rest of the crew, we are here live and we've got Darren McBreen as well as Kit Daniels back in the Twitter station.
[00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:55.600]  They're going to be taking any questions that you might have.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.223]  Of course, direct those to at real Alex Jones.
[00:03:59.603 --> 00:04:03.065]  We've also got Jakari Jackson there as well and David Knight.
[00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:05.626]  So what's it looking like so far?
[00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:06.587]  Any numbers coming in?
[00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:13.370]  Yes, we're also going to have Richard Reeves is going to be joining us in New Hampshire at the Trump Rap Party as soon as they can get in.
[00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.532]  The Secret Service has been sweeping the area so that's been delayed.
[00:04:16.972 --> 00:04:21.954]  We thought that we would be broadcasting that live at 6 but it's going to be coming as soon as they can get in there.
[00:04:22.334 --> 00:04:24.876]  Now we're all are starting to get some results in.
[00:04:24.916 --> 00:04:26.816]  They closed the polls about an hour ago.
[00:04:27.377 --> 00:04:34.940]  It looks like the results are a little bit different than what we saw from Fox News earlier today when they went out and published their
[00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:37.402]  We're good.
[00:04:53.018 --> 00:05:01.927]  We have Bush in third place at 12, Rubio at 10, Cruz at 10, then Christie at 8, Fiorina at 5, and Carson at 2.
[00:05:02.347 --> 00:05:12.578]  The interesting thing about this on the Republican side, at least, is that anybody who gets less than 10 percent, their vote totals are going to roll over to the first place winner.
[00:05:13.018 --> 00:05:20.682]  So, in the case that we're looking at right here, if it were to continue this way, we've got 13-15% right now.
[00:05:21.582 --> 00:05:27.225]  The combined totals of Christie, Fiorina, and Carson, who are below the 10% threshold, that would go to Trump.
[00:05:27.405 --> 00:05:35.949]  So, his actual vote totals would not be 33%, but would actually be 48% in terms of delegate allegation.
[00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.689]  Wow.
[00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.991]  We'll talk about a total burn for Jeb Bush or someone else if they're... Yeah.
[00:05:41.934 --> 00:05:42.114]  Yeah.
[00:05:42.254 --> 00:05:44.296]  Their percentages roll over to Trump or someone.
[00:05:44.816 --> 00:05:50.881]  Now, I know a lot of people are wondering if Rubio's debate debacle is going to send him tanking.
[00:05:51.722 --> 00:05:52.683]  Well, actually it has.
[00:05:52.703 --> 00:05:53.984]  I mean, they expected him to.
[00:05:54.324 --> 00:05:56.306]  He was hoping to come in in second place.
[00:05:56.366 --> 00:06:05.954]  His game plan was to come in third in Iowa, to come in second place in New Hampshire, and then first place in South Carolina to try to keep that momentum going.
[00:06:06.314 --> 00:06:08.615]  And of course, he really didn't have any momentum.
[00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:17.159]  We had Fox News pulling for him very, very hard and very, very transparently, essentially turning his third-place finish into a gold medal.
[00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:24.842]  But that debate issue that he had where Christie pointed out how robotically he was repeating everything, and then he continued to do it.
[00:06:24.862 --> 00:06:25.823]  He had another meltdown.
[00:06:26.383 --> 00:06:26.683]  I don't
[00:06:56.203 --> 00:06:57.124]  We're good to go.
[00:07:12.396 --> 00:07:20.662]  You have Christie and Fiorina as well as Kasich need to perform well in the New Hampshire primary or they're going to be out of the next debate.
[00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:25.846]  They have metrics that are coming for the next debate which is being held by CBS.
[00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:31.951]  They have various things like how they have to place nationally or the South Carolina polls so forth and so on.
[00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:37.675]  And the people who are basically on the chopping block in terms of getting in here are Fiorina,
[00:07:38.335 --> 00:07:38.775]  I think so.
[00:07:55.365 --> 00:07:57.906]  He would still be in the next debate.
[00:07:58.026 --> 00:08:01.167]  He has not campaigned very much in New Hampshire.
[00:08:01.767 --> 00:08:05.028]  And actually, he's not even going to be at his rap party.
[00:08:05.048 --> 00:08:07.729]  I guess he's going to be flying out.
[00:08:07.769 --> 00:08:10.910]  I guess he said, it's my party and I can fly if I want to.
[00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.953]  Well it's interesting because we did have a few trickles, voters were able to trickle out last night.
[00:08:16.993 --> 00:08:20.235]  They opened the polls in some of the areas there, New Hampshire, at midnight.
[00:08:20.715 --> 00:08:27.780]  So we know John Kasich actually beat Trump 3-2 there among Republicans with those tallies coming in.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.442]  Sanders claimed all four votes among Democrats for those early
[00:08:31.502 --> 00:08:36.966]  A sign of early support for Kasich, although those early small towns, they're very, very small.
[00:08:36.986 --> 00:08:37.366]  Very small.
[00:08:37.406 --> 00:08:43.230]  Like Dixville Notch, they had like, I think, nine people, let's say it was, yeah, nine people total that they had there.
[00:08:43.471 --> 00:08:45.192]  And he called them all personally on the phone.
[00:08:46.291 --> 00:09:06.360]  Well, and that's the interesting thing, and I mentioned this earlier on the radio show, the fact that in 1992, I was working with the Libertarian Party, Andre Marou was running for president, and somebody who was a Libertarian activist went to Dixville Notch because they were, we've had three towns that cast votes early this time, they were the one.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.042]  Back in 1992 that did the voting earlier.
[00:09:10.522 --> 00:09:16.725]  So a Libertarian activist sent a Libertarian magazine subscription to each of the residents of Dixville Notch.
[00:09:17.106 --> 00:09:24.770]  So for a year they were getting a Libertarian perspective on current events and news and not just the mainstream media.
[00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:33.575]  And the result of that was that Andre Marou, who was basically unheard of, did not finish very... I think he got maybe a half of a percent nationally, but he won Dixville Notch.
[00:09:34.295 --> 00:09:41.779]  And the lesson that I took away from that was that it is very, very powerful to have that information there, to wake people up.
[00:09:41.819 --> 00:09:44.721]  And there was no way to do that in 1992.
[00:09:45.341 --> 00:09:46.562]  There wasn't any internet.
[00:09:46.662 --> 00:09:50.324]  I mean, you couldn't afford to send a magazine subscription to somebody each and every month.
[00:09:50.364 --> 00:09:51.665]  You couldn't afford to do that.
[00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:53.266]  But that's what's changed.
[00:09:53.766 --> 00:09:59.852]  It's the real authentic media versus the eyewash media that we have had in the past.
[00:09:59.912 --> 00:10:04.957]  The fact that we have the internet, we have the Drudge Report, we have InfoWars, and people can get this information.
[00:10:05.077 --> 00:10:16.588]  And that is what is behind the rise of Trump, even of Carson, of Sanders, is the fact that they can get something that is outside of the establishment because the establishment is thoroughly in the tank.
[00:10:17.128 --> 00:10:18.489]  For Hillary Clinton, for example.
[00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:22.130]  If you look at the delegate counts, that's the other thing that's interesting.
[00:10:22.491 --> 00:10:28.673]  If you look at CNN's delegate counts, they've got like eight votes for... Yeah, we got some Fox results here.
[00:10:29.514 --> 00:10:30.434]  Let's take a look at those.
[00:10:33.596 --> 00:10:36.097]  Okay, they're calling it for Sanders and Trump right there with Fox.
[00:10:36.117 --> 00:10:37.518]  Well, of course, that was expected.
[00:10:37.578 --> 00:10:40.059]  They were expecting some big wins for them.
[00:10:40.419 --> 00:10:44.581]  Yeah, but let's talk about the delegate allocation that's going on here.
[00:10:46.092 --> 00:10:52.956]  Based on Iowa, okay, you had Cruz got 8 delegates, Trump and Rubio each got 7.
[00:10:53.776 --> 00:10:56.938]  And then you go over to the Democrat side and Sanders got 30 some odd.
[00:10:57.298 --> 00:10:58.799]  Hillary Clinton, 422 delegates.
[00:10:58.819 --> 00:11:00.480]  Now how did Hillary Clinton get 422 delegates?
[00:11:04.562 --> 00:11:11.023]  You know, it's a 50-50, and the only votes that they've had so far, which is in the Iowa caucus.
[00:11:11.343 --> 00:11:16.965]  And of course, that is one of the ways that the establishment rigs this, with the superdelegates.
[00:11:17.405 --> 00:11:26.907]  Going all the way back to mid-November, Hillary Clinton already had tied up 15% of the votes that she needed to win the nomination using superdelegates.
[00:11:26.947 --> 00:11:27.947]  And what are superdelegates?
[00:11:27.967 --> 00:11:31.888]  Well, they're not delegates that go into a phone booth and change into their costume.
[00:11:32.788 --> 00:11:39.775]  These are people who are elected officials, who are part of the Democrat National Committee.
[00:11:40.475 --> 00:11:45.500]  They get to choose who they want to vote for regardless of what the public wants.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.562]  And that's what Sanders is up against.
[00:11:47.602 --> 00:11:50.504]  And it's one of the many ways that your vote doesn't count.
[00:11:50.544 --> 00:11:55.569]  It's one of the many reasons that we need to not get 100% tied up in the presidential race.
[00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:56.330]  It's very important.
[00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:07.796]  There are certain things that we can achieve there, but when it comes, certainly now, at this point, now that Rand Paul is out, there isn't any way that we're going to achieve a massive change for the better in individual liberty.
[00:12:07.836 --> 00:12:09.957]  There's not any candidates that are out there supporting that.
[00:12:10.077 --> 00:12:16.020]  So, if you want to do that, you're going to need to pay attention at the state and local level, and there are things that you can do there.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.781]  There are things that can be done at the presidential level still in terms of the TPP that I think are important.
[00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:22.742]  I think we can leverage that with Trump.
[00:12:23.102 --> 00:12:28.583]  But in terms of certain issues, they are essentially off the table now in the presidential race.
[00:12:28.763 --> 00:12:35.745]  Absolutely, and that's why Richard Reeves, we've got a video out of that where he explains why the delegate process is so important.
[00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:48.652]  And also, I know that there are reports now there was a Libertarian group who had been working, and thanks to social media, they were able to get a large enough group of Libertarians to agree to move to New Hampshire.
[00:12:48.672 --> 00:12:50.633]  Yeah, something that's been going on for a while.
[00:12:50.793 --> 00:12:51.054]  Right.
[00:12:51.074 --> 00:12:51.894]  The Free State Project.
[00:12:51.914 --> 00:12:53.195]  Yes, the Free State Project.
[00:12:53.235 --> 00:12:55.756]  And so they were able to get those 200,000 people, or 20,000.
[00:12:55.796 --> 00:12:57.477]  20,000, yeah.
[00:12:57.497 --> 00:12:59.098]  Enough to make a difference, but they're not all there.
[00:12:59.439 --> 00:13:00.939]  That number of people have made that commitment.
[00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:05.042]  Let's take a look at the video report that we have about Delegate Math.
[00:13:14.232 --> 00:13:16.194]  Richard Reeves with InfoWars.com.
[00:13:16.494 --> 00:13:17.675]  Today is the big day.
[00:13:17.735 --> 00:13:20.177]  Today is primary day in New Hampshire.
[00:13:20.537 --> 00:13:22.259]  The day we've been waiting for for months.
[00:13:22.619 --> 00:13:26.662]  Will Donald Trump get the big victory that has been predicted for so long?
[00:13:27.123 --> 00:13:28.464]  Or will he get black boxed?
[00:13:28.904 --> 00:13:31.947]  Or will there be some other shenanigans that we don't even know of yet?
[00:13:32.407 --> 00:13:33.508]  We're going to find out tonight.
[00:13:34.169 --> 00:13:35.750]  In the meantime, we are at
[00:13:36.491 --> 00:13:45.054]  The New Hampshire Republican Party headquarters, where we were working on a big story to learn how the delegate process works in New Hampshire.
[00:13:45.114 --> 00:13:50.915]  We want to bring the inside baseball to the Info Warriors in New Hampshire and other states as well.
[00:13:51.436 --> 00:14:00.899]  Each state is different, but we're going to try to find out our best information on how you go to Cleveland, Ohio for the RNC from here in New Hampshire.
[00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:05.480]  For now, we are at the Statehouse of New Hampshire, the capital of New Hampshire.
[00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:09.962]  And we have with us Deputy Secretary of State, Mr. Dave Scanlon.
[00:14:10.482 --> 00:14:12.163]  Thank you, Mr. Scanlon, for inviting us here.
[00:14:12.263 --> 00:14:13.923]  And tell us a little bit about this room that we're in.
[00:14:14.123 --> 00:14:14.424]  Sure.
[00:14:14.484 --> 00:14:15.544]  It's great to be here.
[00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:17.725]  This is Representatives Hall in New Hampshire.
[00:14:18.405 --> 00:14:26.247]  It is the third largest parliamentary body in the English-speaking world behind the British Parliament and the United States Congress.
[00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:28.668]  There are 400 members that sit here.
[00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:30.949]  Each represents roughly 3,300 constituents.
[00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:39.177]  And if California had a similar representation, they would have around 13,000 legislators in their assembly.
[00:14:40.238 --> 00:14:47.226]  Wow, that would be a huge event for them to even try to meet together, not to mention, I guess, the air conditioning bill, but maybe they wouldn't worry about that, I guess.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.863]  One of the reasons we came to visit with you today was to find out about how the delegate process works.
[00:14:53.924 --> 00:15:07.594]  What we've learned doing our reports around the country is that each state has a different methodology of how they select delegates that end up going to Cleveland at the RNC or to Philadelphia for the Democrats in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, obviously.
[00:15:08.034 --> 00:15:12.698]  So tell us what you know about the Democratic side and tell us what you know about the Republican side.
[00:15:12.938 --> 00:15:13.098]  Right.
[00:15:13.238 --> 00:15:17.121]  Well, both parties have a different process for choosing their delegates.
[00:15:17.722 --> 00:15:21.204]  On the Democrat side, it is in-house, basically.
[00:15:21.224 --> 00:15:27.989]  I'm not sure how many delegates they assign New Hampshire, but their process is internal.
[00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.452]  Some are selected from the population of New Hampshire.
[00:15:32.092 --> 00:15:33.693]  Other delegates are automatic.
[00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:35.815]  They might be the party chair.
[00:15:36.773 --> 00:15:45.759]  There are committee persons and others that are high up in the party establishment that have an automatic ticket to their national convention.
[00:15:46.359 --> 00:15:55.465]  On the Republican side, the National Republican Committee has given or assigned 23 delegates to the state of New Hampshire.
[00:15:55.885 --> 00:15:58.387]  Those are awarded on a proportional basis.
[00:15:59.268 --> 00:16:06.012]  A candidate must receive at least 10% of the vote to be able to garner delegates.
[00:16:06.909 --> 00:16:12.231]  Uh, the number that are assigned to them depends on what their percentage of the vote is above the 10%.
[00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:23.894]  Any delegates that would otherwise be assigned to the candidates that received less than 10% of the vote are given or they're awarded to the winner of the New Hampshire primary.
[00:16:24.915 --> 00:16:33.457]  So, uh, say a hypothetical result would say, let's say a candidate A, 30% of the vote, candidate B, 20%, and then let's say you got C, D, E with 5%.
[00:16:33.977 --> 00:16:35.898]  So how, about how would that shake out roughly?
[00:16:36.334 --> 00:16:45.158]  So the two candidates receiving 30% and 20% would be the only two candidates to receive delegates.
[00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:50.541]  They would be awarded on the proportional basis of the percentage of the vote that they got.
[00:16:51.441 --> 00:16:54.323]  And then, for example, if it was 20% of
[00:16:57.722 --> 00:17:00.524]  23 is going to be four plus delegates.
[00:17:04.227 --> 00:17:13.953]  And then the delegates that are left over in the three delegates that received less than 10% would be assigned to the winner of the New Hampshire primary.
[00:17:14.693 --> 00:17:16.955]  OK, that's very interesting to find out how that works out.
[00:17:17.455 --> 00:17:23.339]  So what do you kind of expect to see as far as turnout for this election, this primary day today?
[00:17:23.663 --> 00:17:28.327]  Well, we're seeing now in the polling places a strong, steady turnout.
[00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:34.632]  We're optimistic that the turnout is going to be very high, if not a record, by the end of the day.
[00:17:35.133 --> 00:17:36.113]  So there we have it, folks.
[00:17:36.394 --> 00:17:38.816]  The New Hampshire Delegate Math Explained.
[00:17:39.576 --> 00:17:47.283]  The goal of the debate was to make unviable candidates viable up over 10% of the vote so they could get their delegates and keep them.
[00:17:48.328 --> 00:17:59.594]  All the candidates that finish below the 10% threshold will have to give up their delegates to the winner, which should be Donald Trump, providing the polls are correct and that Donald Trump does not get black boxed.
[00:18:00.175 --> 00:18:01.916]  So watch for that.
[00:18:02.156 --> 00:18:02.976]  We'll keep an eye on that.
[00:18:03.016 --> 00:18:04.217]  We'll be reporting more on that.
[00:18:04.697 --> 00:18:12.040]  As a reminder, in Iowa, basically you had Cruz, Trump, and Rubio come out with basically a third, a third, and a third of the delegates.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:18.603]  And as we've explained before, we're looking for Donald Trump to start achieving 60% of the delegates to go to Cleveland.
[00:18:19.063 --> 00:18:25.286]  So we will be making new reports in the future about all of this delegate math in all the states.
[00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:39.734]  Well, that is very interesting, considering the fact that Clinton went into this already holding six of the delegates there.
[00:18:39.754 --> 00:18:40.654]  That's right.
[00:18:40.915 --> 00:18:42.155]  Six of the eight delegates.
[00:18:42.175 --> 00:18:44.377]  So that's the math on the Democrat side.
[00:18:44.717 --> 00:18:46.037]  It's really skewed toward there.
[00:18:46.798 --> 00:18:47.298]  Absolutely.
[00:18:47.698 --> 00:18:48.499]  Well, stick around.
[00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:50.020]  We will be right back after this.
[00:19:01.095 --> 00:19:13.495]  Look, I don't know what your problem is, but I simply cannot have students wandering the hallways during class, interrupting other classes, and giving prophecies of a great plague!
[00:19:14.386 --> 00:19:15.687]  We believe in win-win, folks.
[00:19:15.747 --> 00:19:17.467]  Treating people like we want to be treated.
[00:19:17.688 --> 00:19:22.249]  That's why we developed NutraCyticals with Dr. Gripp and other top researchers, chemists, scientists, you name it.
[00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:23.350]  He's one of our advisors.
[00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:29.112]  To come up with products like AnthroPlex that is an original product that he made just for us.
[00:19:30.033 --> 00:19:31.874]  And this is a base
[00:19:32.934 --> 00:19:33.714]  We're good to go.
[00:19:59.184 --> 00:19:59.804]  It'll sell out.
[00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:10.932]  So, Infowarslife.com, Anthroplex, 15% off and free shipping for the next two days only when you get it with Supermail or Female Vitality.
[00:20:11.052 --> 00:20:11.833]  Let's go to Dr. Group.
[00:20:12.013 --> 00:20:17.857]  Why do you call this the foundation to start the fire and then the Supermail takes you to the next level?
[00:20:19.093 --> 00:20:35.920]  Well, we just look at the base problem that's going on right now all over the world, which is the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the amount of estrogen that men have, the femininity of men, and what's going on even in children right now with low testosterone levels.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.061]  We're good to go!
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.681]  We're good to go.
[00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:36.933]  Well the horny goat weed was given that name because years ago in India they noticed that a certain time of the year this weed would grow and the goats would eat it and they would just go crazy with all the female goats.
[00:21:37.013 --> 00:21:38.534]  So that's how it was developed.
[00:21:38.574 --> 00:21:39.494]  It's called epimidium.
[00:21:40.314 --> 00:21:47.015]  And what that's been proven to do over thousands of years is increase sexual pleasure, help balance the male hormones.
[00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:48.795]  It can actually be used for women as well.
[00:21:49.236 --> 00:21:56.117]  But it really kind of resets and brings the hormone balance, improves sperm motility, and increases testosterone levels.
[00:21:56.137 --> 00:21:58.117]  So it counters the stuff they've been throwing at us.
[00:21:58.377 --> 00:21:59.477]  Results will vary.
[00:21:59.557 --> 00:22:02.178]  Overall, all I know is dynamite.
[00:22:02.658 --> 00:22:07.499]  I mean, absolutely dynamite with stamina, with the weightlifting, with the swimming.
[00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:09.059]  Folks, the new product is available.
[00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:12.745]  Anthroplex, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:13.105 --> 00:22:15.249]  Dr. Group, thank you for developing this amazing product.
[00:22:15.409 --> 00:22:15.710]  Thank you.
[00:23:18.973 --> 00:23:19.454]  Welcome back.
[00:23:30.874 --> 00:23:33.735]  Hillary Clinton going in had six of the delegates.
[00:23:33.875 --> 00:23:34.895]  Yeah, six of the delegates.
[00:23:35.175 --> 00:23:44.778]  But going in and when you look at the CNN report, it truly is amazing because it really does show how the system is rigged by the establishment for the establishment candidates.
[00:23:45.318 --> 00:23:49.520]  You see 422 delegates for Hillary Clinton, 30 some odd for Sanders.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.080]  That's the way this thing has been rigged.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:56.702]  Back in the middle of November, Clinton had 62% of the superdelegates, Sanders had
[00:23:57.342 --> 00:23:59.043]  One percent of the superdelegates.
[00:23:59.463 --> 00:24:01.303]  And the uncommitted were 37 percent.
[00:24:01.323 --> 00:24:10.607]  Now those are the people, again, who are elected officials like congressmen and senators and the people who are DNC officials, each state.
[00:24:11.027 --> 00:24:13.868]  So these people get to vote however they wish.
[00:24:13.888 --> 00:24:16.509]  They're not bound by any kind of popular vote.
[00:24:17.109 --> 00:24:19.530]  And that is the way that this system is.
[00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:25.571]  That's why she thinks she's going to win and why it's a very good chance that she will win, regardless of the popular support for Sanders.
[00:24:25.591 --> 00:24:30.592]  And right now we're seeing that it's 56% for Sanders and 42% for Clinton.
[00:24:30.932 --> 00:24:41.094]  But I think it's interesting when you look at the exit polls, they're asking people, you know, are you an independent, Democrat, Republican, because there's a huge number of independents in New Hampshire.
[00:24:41.254 --> 00:24:45.797]  You can walk up to the polling place and you can say, I want a Democrat ballot or I want a Republican ballot.
[00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:50.000]  Are they going to go in and vote for the candidate that they want?
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:57.245]  Are they going to play games and say, well, you know, I want to make sure that this other guy in the other party gets the nomination because I think we can beat him.
[00:24:57.325 --> 00:24:59.046]  You know, so they can play that kind of a game.
[00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:00.928]  You never know exactly what they're going to do.
[00:25:01.368 --> 00:25:04.070]  But let's take a look at some of the early indicators from this.
[00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:15.177]  Of course, we've got ABC News reporting that half of the people coming out of the GOP primary were saying 57% in the group backed Trump, who wanted a political outsider.
[00:25:15.197 --> 00:25:16.838]  So half of them wanted a political outsider.
[00:25:17.058 --> 00:25:20.360]  They saw Trump as the person who was the political outsider, not
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.680]  Ted Cruz.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.321]  Only 12% of the people who said they wanted an outsider went for Ted Cruz.
[00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:28.561]  4 in 10 were angry with the Obama administration.
[00:25:29.141 --> 00:25:31.622]  Trump won 39% of those votes.
[00:25:31.942 --> 00:25:33.742]  Next closest was Cruz at 17%.
[00:25:34.102 --> 00:25:39.203]  Two-thirds said they would support Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country.
[00:25:39.603 --> 00:25:41.804]  He won 42% of their votes.
[00:25:41.844 --> 00:25:45.384]  It looks like it may be a big night for Donald Trump in New Hampshire.
[00:25:46.144 --> 00:25:49.225]  It's very interesting how this is going to break out again because of the
[00:25:49.885 --> 00:25:50.885]  Independence coming in there.
[00:25:50.906 --> 00:25:58.088]  They said 46% according to CNN, 46% of the voters that they talked to with the GOP said they made up their minds in the last three days.
[00:25:58.108 --> 00:26:02.150]  65% said the debates were very important.
[00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.230]  10% saying they were the most important factor.
[00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:13.394]  That's why you're seeing Rubio falling down into a distant fourth place because the debates absolutely came apart in the debates.
[00:26:13.714 --> 00:26:18.016]  And a classic moment that will be entertaining for years to anybody who likes politics.
[00:26:18.936 --> 00:26:19.076]  Yeah.
[00:26:38.476 --> 00:26:44.417]  Mainstream people are really seeing this veil being pulled back, not just those of us who have already kind of had it pulled back a little bit.
[00:26:44.437 --> 00:26:54.439]  Yeah, of course, it's being able to transcend and get around the eyewash media, but also the traditional way that people communicate with voters through television ads.
[00:26:54.539 --> 00:26:57.179]  That is just not on the table this time.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:05.281]  Donald Trump is able to go directly to people with Twitter, can completely go around the gatekeepers that get paid so much money.
[00:27:06.101 --> 00:27:13.804]  Jeb Bush has blown through over $100 million worth of Super PAC money on TV ads and it has absolutely done nothing for him.
[00:27:14.004 --> 00:27:14.684]  Nothing for him.
[00:27:15.204 --> 00:27:17.625]  And Donald Trump has spent hardly anything.
[00:27:17.925 --> 00:27:22.986]  Now on the Democrat side, some of the interesting exit polling that was coming out of CNN, listen to this.
[00:27:23.287 --> 00:27:27.568]  32% of Democrats coming out said they wanted a candidate who was honest and trustworthy.
[00:27:27.968 --> 00:27:30.709]  Doesn't look too good for Hillary.
[00:27:31.089 --> 00:27:33.710]  27% said they're looking for a candidate who cares about people.
[00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.212]  Looking bad for her there again, too.
[00:27:37.572 --> 00:27:41.855]  27% wanted a candidate with the right experience, and 13% put electability first.
[00:27:41.915 --> 00:27:47.778]  So maybe she can pick up some of those candidates if they think that experience is the right thing and electability.
[00:27:47.818 --> 00:27:58.145]  But certainly, if people want an honest, trustworthy candidate who cares about people, and that was 59% of the people coming out, so that was their first priority, that doesn't look too good.
[00:27:58.405 --> 00:27:59.506]  And interestingly enough,
[00:28:00.106 --> 00:28:03.968]  That pretty much follows what we're seeing here in the early results for Sanders.
[00:28:03.988 --> 00:28:07.670]  You know, 59% say they want somebody who's honest, trustworthy, and cares about people.
[00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.912]  That's the way they perceive Sanders, whether or not you perceive him that way or not.
[00:28:11.992 --> 00:28:15.174]  They certainly are not going to be seeing that in Hillary Clinton.
[00:28:15.214 --> 00:28:19.976]  So that 59% of the people are pretty much breaking for Bernie Sanders right now.
[00:28:20.342 --> 00:28:25.126]  Right, and we'll talk a little bit more about that later, why millennials love Bernie Sanders so much.
[00:28:25.506 --> 00:28:31.231]  But I thought it was really interesting that Hillary Clinton, this entire time, she's been really selling her experience.
[00:28:31.451 --> 00:28:35.674]  Aside from being a woman, her experience was her big selling point.
[00:28:36.074 --> 00:28:45.382]  And then to sort of retaliate against what some younger people say is, you know, she's been in politics forever, she's always been in our face, we're tired of her, we want someone new.
[00:28:46.022 --> 00:28:50.407]  And she actually came out and saying, well, Sanders has been in politics longer than I have.
[00:28:50.827 --> 00:28:54.471]  So I think that's sort of funny that they would say that, basically.
[00:28:54.511 --> 00:28:59.096]  So now she can't even use her experience as the big selling point.
[00:28:59.116 --> 00:29:02.300]  You know, her big selling point, quite honestly, is the fact that she's a woman.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.502]  That's really what she's coming off of.
[00:29:05.763 --> 00:29:13.146]  The big problem is that it's not working out too well for her either and it's not going to work out too well if Donald Trump gets the nomination.
[00:29:13.506 --> 00:29:27.892]  Roger Stone has got that rape pack that they're putting together where they're going to have the former victims, it's going to be a victims club of Bill Clinton and they've got a lot of people who can join that club and they're going to be very vocal about what happened.
[00:29:27.912 --> 00:29:31.953]  People like Kathleen Willey who said that Hillary Clinton is the war on women.
[00:29:31.973 --> 00:29:32.894]  I think she's more upset
[00:29:33.414 --> 00:29:42.782]  With the way she was treated by Hillary Clinton, even in the aftermath, the damage that was done, that's what we hear over and over again from the women that Bill Clinton abused.
[00:29:42.923 --> 00:29:52.471]  They're more concerned and upset about what Hillary did to them afterwards, piling on to them even as much, if not more so, than the initial attack in many cases.
[00:29:52.671 --> 00:29:53.471]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:53.511 --> 00:29:59.413]  And it's interesting to see just how many decades of dust has been left.
[00:29:59.433 --> 00:30:02.413]  I mean, when they say where there's smoke, there's fire, right?
[00:30:02.433 --> 00:30:04.854]  Well, these people have been smoldering for decades.
[00:30:04.914 --> 00:30:09.895]  There's a trail constantly of chatters of this, noise of that, rumors of this.
[00:30:10.455 --> 00:30:13.036]  And they've always been able to sort of bat it away.
[00:30:13.456 --> 00:30:16.117]  And even now, she's facing possible indictment.
[00:30:16.417 --> 00:30:20.278]  And she, well, at least until now, she was a Democratic frontrunner.
[00:30:20.498 --> 00:30:22.278]  They bat it away, nothing seems to stick to them.
[00:30:22.318 --> 00:30:30.980]  Of course, you know, we've seen this throughout the initial Clinton administration, all the different skullduggery and corruption charges, even murder charges.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.201]  They were able to skirt everything.
[00:30:33.741 --> 00:30:41.062]  And when people talk about the impeachment, let's understand the impeachment was not about Bill Clinton having a consensual affair with Monica Lewinsky.
[00:30:41.182 --> 00:30:44.963]  It was about the lies that he told under oath
[00:30:45.563 --> 00:30:45.883]  I think so.
[00:31:06.306 --> 00:31:09.870]  Hillary Clinton's gang of old women who are always there to support her.
[00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:17.439]  People like Madeleine Albright, who's now in her 80s, and she comes out and says there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other.
[00:31:17.459 --> 00:31:19.941]  In other words, you need to get behind Hillary Clinton.
[00:31:20.202 --> 00:31:24.907]  Now this is Madeleine Albright telling you there's a special place in hell for you.
[00:31:26.594 --> 00:31:36.036]  This is a woman who said in an interview that, you know, a half a million people, she was asked, a half a million children have died from these sanctions that you put against Iraq.
[00:31:36.556 --> 00:31:37.057]  Was it worth it?
[00:31:37.097 --> 00:31:38.757]  She said, yeah, yeah, it was worth it.
[00:31:38.797 --> 00:31:39.337]  I think it was worth it.
[00:31:39.477 --> 00:31:44.778]  And she's talking about people going to hell because they don't support a fellow woman, simply because she's a woman.
[00:31:44.818 --> 00:31:50.320]  And then we got Gloria Steinem saying, well, you know, people are following Bernie Sanders because they want to, where are the boys?
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.760]  Well, the boys are with Bernie, says Ms.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:52.180]  Steinem.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.641]  So, in other words, a real feminist would not be a heterosexual.
[00:31:56.061 --> 00:31:57.781]  That's essentially what she's saying.
[00:31:57.801 --> 00:32:01.162]  Young women don't have brains of their own if they're voting for Bernie.
[00:32:02.022 --> 00:32:04.083]  They're only there because of boys.
[00:32:04.283 --> 00:32:07.883]  So basically we have these older women being pitted against the younger women.
[00:32:08.464 --> 00:32:10.404]  Basically they mean nothing.
[00:32:10.444 --> 00:32:11.884]  They're not involved in politics.
[00:32:11.944 --> 00:32:13.145]  You girls are just silly.
[00:32:13.165 --> 00:32:20.446]  And of course she calls, Hillary Clinton lovingly refers to these ladies as the sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits.
[00:32:23.167 --> 00:32:24.707]  I don't think the young girls are wearing pantsuits.
[00:32:24.987 --> 00:32:26.048]  No, definitely not.
[00:32:26.448 --> 00:32:29.030]  Well, when we come back, we're going to be speaking with Richard Reeves.
[00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:31.391]  He is there on the ground in New Hampshire.
[00:32:31.831 --> 00:32:34.113]  I guess we'll have some good footage there out of the Trump event.
[00:32:34.553 --> 00:32:35.313]  So stay tuned.
[00:32:35.333 --> 00:32:37.234]  We're going to have more special reports as well.
[00:32:37.274 --> 00:32:40.236]  Jakari Jackson and Darren McBreen at the Twitter booth.
[00:32:41.037 --> 00:32:45.339]  Stay with us for another hour and a half of the New Hampshire primaries wrap up.
[00:32:56.283 --> 00:32:58.769]  You're listening to Alex Jones!
[00:33:19.654 --> 00:33:22.116]  This is Bernie Sanders and I'm quite upset.
[00:33:22.316 --> 00:33:29.059]  If you guys saw the Iowa Caucus the other night, you would know that I worked extremely hard for these votes.
[00:33:29.359 --> 00:33:35.542]  And the people that were working in the Iowa Caucus took what I worked hard for and gave it to someone else.
[00:33:35.842 --> 00:33:40.824]  A lying, cheating, horrible human being by the name of Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:43.005 --> 00:33:46.908]  I don't understand how anybody could like something like this.
[00:33:46.988 --> 00:33:59.256]  That you work hard for something your whole life and you earn something and then you're expected to give it to someone else who's not as deserving and is too lazy or more of a piece of crap than you are.
[00:33:59.396 --> 00:34:02.378]  What kind of person would even think about something like that?
[00:34:02.618 --> 00:34:06.001]  Hey, that'd be you Bernie Sanders.
[00:34:06.241 --> 00:34:07.301]  Guess you just felt the Bern.
[00:34:08.422 --> 00:34:11.424]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:11.624 --> 00:34:12.245]  I'm Joe Biggs.

[00:34:19.403 --> 00:34:22.946]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:34:23.206 --> 00:34:25.828]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:29.572]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[00:34:57.824 --> 00:34:58.724]  Thanks for watching.
[00:35:17.253 --> 00:35:23.478]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:35:23.498 --> 00:35:26.860]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.561]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:35:28.601 --> 00:35:34.866]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:40.830]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.772]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.

[00:35:47.873 --> 00:35:56.056]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:35:56.317 --> 00:35:58.377]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:35:58.417 --> 00:35:59.478]  It's a war against the truth.

[00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:47.085]  Yeah.
[00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:27.137]  Welcome back to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:37:27.197 --> 00:37:30.060]  We are here watching the votes come in there in New Hampshire.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.522]  Voters are deciding who they'd like to see as the president.
[00:37:33.022 --> 00:37:38.687]  Now, David, as we're looking at these scores coming in, it just says it's at 12% now, but they've already called it.
[00:37:38.747 --> 00:37:40.169]  So how can that, how can that be?
[00:37:40.563 --> 00:37:52.974]  Well, when they look at the vote totals that are coming in and they've got some partial results from other places, they do exit polling and now that the polls are closed, they can take a look at their exit polls and see how things are breaking for a particular candidate.
[00:37:52.994 --> 00:38:01.301]  When you've got that much of a lead, he's got an 18 point lead right now over the second place person and he had been projected to have something like that.
[00:38:01.561 --> 00:38:07.704]  It's not really a surprise, it's not really a reach to say that Donald Trump is going to win this.
[00:38:07.744 --> 00:38:08.445]  He's at 34%.
[00:38:08.605 --> 00:38:09.886]  Number two is Kasich.
[00:38:10.466 --> 00:38:17.570]  And that's something of a surprise, because there's been this race between Kasich, Bush and Rubio, and also Christie.
[00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:21.412]  Christie and Kasich have spent the most time in New Hampshire.
[00:38:21.472 --> 00:38:22.793]  They felt they could pull it out there.
[00:38:23.033 --> 00:38:26.995]  It's not worked out very well for Chris Christie, but it has worked out very well for John Kasich.
[00:38:27.355 --> 00:38:29.977]  In terms of pulling in a second place finish there.
[00:38:30.577 --> 00:38:32.759]  He's been pulling very, very low.
[00:38:32.839 --> 00:38:36.021]  So I don't know that he's going to do that well outside of New Hampshire.
[00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:40.845]  I think this is an anomaly, just like I think Cruz doing really well in Iowa.
[00:38:40.865 --> 00:38:47.270]  That was something of an anomaly there because he was able to tie in to the Evangelical Kingmakers that they have in Iowa.
[00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:55.656]  And they have skewed the results in the last several elections in Iowa so that on the GOP side, Iowa is not really a very good predictor.
[00:38:56.431 --> 00:39:00.592]  Right, and it's interesting we're seeing Bush rising up from the ashes.
[00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:05.513]  Yeah, he's in third place and he's going to make a big deal of that, but he's only got 12% and he's spent a lot of money.
[00:39:05.553 --> 00:39:12.135]  This guy has spent over $100 million and the best he can show for it is 12% in New Hampshire, third place finish.
[00:39:12.155 --> 00:39:13.295]  I would say loser.
[00:39:15.476 --> 00:39:16.677]  Somebody else already said it for me.
[00:39:16.757 --> 00:39:20.301]  When Marco Rubio was in third place after Iowa, now he was the big winner.
[00:39:20.641 --> 00:39:26.146]  So it'll be interesting to see if that's the same angle the media takes with Bush there being the big winner.
[00:39:26.586 --> 00:39:29.049]  Well, let's go ahead and see if we can connect with Richard Reeves.
[00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:30.590]  He's there in New Hampshire.
[00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:31.031]  Richard.
[00:39:32.212 --> 00:39:32.812]  Hi Leanne.
[00:39:32.852 --> 00:39:33.533]  Hi David.
[00:39:33.793 --> 00:39:35.014]  Thank y'all very much.
[00:39:35.174 --> 00:39:39.038]  Yes, the room is pretty electric with excitement here.
[00:39:39.701 --> 00:39:44.844]  The folks are really pumped up because it looks like the polls are going to be correct regarding Trump winning tonight 34%.
[00:39:45.024 --> 00:39:56.710]  And Leanne, as you stated, it is a very small minority of precincts that have reported 12% on the Republican side, 15% on the Democrat side.
[00:39:57.271 --> 00:40:04.615]  The thing to watch for here is with Chris Christie currently sitting at the 8% level as I'm looking at the CNN screen.
[00:40:05.575 --> 00:40:15.127]  What it is, is that it appears that what they want to do is have as many candidates as possible finish with over 10% of the votership.
[00:40:15.387 --> 00:40:20.514]  Because anybody that gets 10% or more gets delegates out of New Hampshire.
[00:40:21.275 --> 00:40:21.455]  So...
[00:40:22.456 --> 00:40:33.622]  As we've already stated in previous interviews, for Trump to really seriously go into the RNC in July in Cleveland, Ohio, he needs to be sitting on probably 60% of the delegates.
[00:40:33.642 --> 00:40:33.622]  60.
[00:40:34.123 --> 00:40:34.303]  Not 50.
[00:40:34.783 --> 00:40:37.605]  60 because of the superdelegate situation.
[00:40:38.065 --> 00:40:41.567]  You know, the RNC, lockstep, they're going to go establishment.
[00:40:41.967 --> 00:40:43.148]  Those are the superdelegates.
[00:40:43.488 --> 00:40:46.650]  And other establishment GOP members are superdelegates.
[00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:47.710]  So Trump really needs 60%.
[00:40:49.488 --> 00:41:00.550]  Right now, in these proportional states, they're going to try to keep him down at 30 or 40 percent of the delegates, which those are not enough to go into Cleveland with and be assured of victory.
[00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:02.571]  So, like I say, watch for Chris Christie.
[00:41:02.891 --> 00:41:05.911]  It's going to be key to watch with all these precincts still out there.
[00:41:06.392 --> 00:41:10.452]  You will not be surprised to see his numbers creep up to 10 percent.
[00:41:11.073 --> 00:41:14.953]  So, that'll give them another candidate to split the delegates with.
[00:41:18.922 --> 00:41:32.938]  Well, you know, the interesting thing, Richard, is that if it holds the way that it's been tonight, if he doesn't creep up into the 10% level, the other way to look at this is that with Christie at 8, Purina at 4, Carson at 2, that's 14% that would go to Trump.
[00:41:33.359 --> 00:41:38.605]  So instead of getting 34%, he would actually be at 48%, essentially, in terms of delegates.
[00:41:39.588 --> 00:41:44.251]  Right, he'll get those delegates that go to those folks, or that would go to the folks that are below 10%.
[00:41:44.892 --> 00:41:45.172]  Yes.
[00:41:45.692 --> 00:41:50.976]  But I like to say, I think Christie, they'll do a little black box magic to get him to the 10% level.
[00:41:51.837 --> 00:41:57.221]  But I do think this is super bad news for Fiorina and Carson, two of the outside candidates.
[00:41:57.841 --> 00:41:59.302]  This is probably going to end their bid.
[00:41:59.442 --> 00:42:01.164]  It's probably going to be the end of the road.
[00:42:02.068 --> 00:42:08.632]  Most certainly for Fiorina and with Carson, probably about an 80% chance that this is going to be the end of the road.
[00:42:08.652 --> 00:42:16.036]  So we're going to be narrowed down to Trump, Kasich, Bush, Cruz, Rubio, and I'm sure Christie will continue.
[00:42:16.637 --> 00:42:20.339]  So that's going to be the one to watch, Chris Christie.
[00:42:20.499 --> 00:42:27.163]  But nonetheless, to see Trump pull this victory off, you know, it would just be lovely to see him going to South Carolina.
[00:42:27.788 --> 00:42:34.192]  Get a 50% or more of the popular vote and start getting that 50-60% threshold with the delegates.
[00:42:34.212 --> 00:42:46.859]  Now, what we've got from between now until the middle of March is we've got proportional states, proportional delegations being given out according to the popular vote.
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:56.125]  So one thing to be looking at when the black boxes could really come out on the voting will be in the middle of March when we have winner-take-all states like Florida
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.181]  Florida's a big winner-take-all.
[00:42:58.221 --> 00:43:02.423]  I think that's the biggest, the first biggest winner-take-all state.
[00:43:03.283 --> 00:43:06.505]  So, if they're going to black box, that'll be a big one.
[00:43:06.645 --> 00:43:13.369]  I think the powers that be are pretty satisfied right now with playing this proportional delegate game.
[00:43:14.585 --> 00:43:18.428]  Well, you know, one of the things, Richard, you're talking about being the end of the road for some of these lower candidates.
[00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:22.392]  Carson didn't really campaign in New Hampshire.
[00:43:23.132 --> 00:43:33.361]  He has already met the qualifications to be in the next debate for CBS, but the ones who really had to perform this time to get into the debate were Kasich, Christie, and Fiorina.
[00:43:33.962 --> 00:43:36.384]  They needed to get a top five finish.
[00:43:36.504 --> 00:43:38.125]  Now, you've got Christie is in
[00:43:39.286 --> 00:43:41.348]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6th place.
[00:43:41.688 --> 00:43:42.749]  Fiorina is below him.
[00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:46.271]  So they would be the two that would not make the debate the next time.
[00:43:46.351 --> 00:43:48.613]  So that would be one key thing there.
[00:43:48.913 --> 00:43:52.436]  Chris Todd has predicted that he doesn't think anybody is going to get out after New Hampshire.
[00:43:52.816 --> 00:43:54.657]  I don't really know about Fiorina.
[00:43:54.677 --> 00:44:01.722]  I mean, by all rights, I don't really know how she keeps going, but she doesn't seem to have any shame, so I think she can just keep going indefinitely.
[00:44:04.104 --> 00:44:08.207]  Well, it's just too bad that she didn't pick up some of the rhetoric that she's doing right now.
[00:44:08.973 --> 00:44:16.037]  And talking the way she's talking, if she would have talked like that earlier in the campaign, she might have had a chance, but she certainly has fallen in the polls.
[00:44:16.757 --> 00:44:22.360]  And as far as I can tell, well, she did do a lot of groundwork in Iowa, but not so much here in New Hampshire.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:34.447]  And speaking of groundwork, that's where Kasich, actually for people here in New Hampshire, Kasich is not really a surprise, actually, because just like Ted Cruz shook the most hands in Iowa,
[00:44:35.087 --> 00:44:38.492]  Looked at the most people, looked them in the eye in Iowa.
[00:44:38.833 --> 00:44:39.774]  That's what Kasich did.
[00:44:40.215 --> 00:44:41.877]  He shook the most hands in New Hampshire.
[00:44:42.378 --> 00:44:45.121]  He shook, you know, he shook their hands and looked them in the eye.
[00:44:45.162 --> 00:44:47.405]  He and Christie spent the most time there of all the candidates.
[00:44:47.505 --> 00:44:49.127]  Yeah, I believe Christie was there for 72 days.
[00:44:51.229 --> 00:44:51.489]  Right.
[00:44:51.529 --> 00:44:55.532]  Well, and you've got to remember Chris Christie, I think he was down at one or two percent in Iowa.
[00:44:56.012 --> 00:45:01.096]  So despite the fact that he did some work in Iowa, when he came to New Hampshire, he did all that work.
[00:45:01.536 --> 00:45:04.158]  But, you know, the people just aren't really liking him.
[00:45:04.198 --> 00:45:10.842]  We found some people that liked him, but it was still we went to one of his events yesterday and it was a manufactured crowd.
[00:45:10.922 --> 00:45:17.987]  It was at a big internet cloud business that mostly to fill up and make a crowd were employees of that business.
[00:45:18.307 --> 00:45:18.487]  Yeah.
[00:45:18.687 --> 00:45:20.909]  Well, how important are the results here at New Hampshire?
[00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:29.233]  Well, again, for Chris Christie, if he stays where he is in sixth place, he's not going to be in the next debate.
[00:45:29.873 --> 00:45:36.096]  And, of course, he was the one who took down the establishment darling Rubio in the last one.
[00:45:36.136 --> 00:45:38.037]  So, he hasn't performed very well.
[00:45:38.117 --> 00:45:41.119]  He spent a lot of time, a lot of energy in New Hampshire hoping he'd perform there.
[00:45:41.139 --> 00:45:43.460]  So, it looks like really bad news for him.
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.981]  Maybe he will drop out, but we'll have to wait and see.
[00:45:46.001 --> 00:45:50.363]  Because, coming up, I don't expect him to do well in South Carolina or Nevada.
[00:45:51.085 --> 00:45:57.344]  And it's going to be pretty hard for him to have the financial resources that he needs to compete on March 1st, Super Tuesday.
[00:45:58.853 --> 00:46:03.936]  Well, I think potentially he's, you know, one of the establishment darlings, so he may have the money to go on.
[00:46:04.537 --> 00:46:09.400]  Maybe they change the rules for the debate to squeeze him on, literally squeeze him on the stage.
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:11.461]  But we'll see.
[00:46:11.961 --> 00:46:12.322]  We'll see.
[00:46:12.602 --> 00:46:14.263]  I don't think we've seen the last Chris Christie.
[00:46:14.603 --> 00:46:19.386]  And if he does, if he does potentially get out, it won't be a dropping out of the campaign.
[00:46:19.426 --> 00:46:20.567]  It'll be another suspension.
[00:46:20.967 --> 00:46:26.911]  You know, that's another key word that these guys use when they drop out, supposedly, is they suspend their campaign.
[00:46:27.651 --> 00:46:27.831]  Yeah.
[00:46:27.851 --> 00:46:28.871]  You know, it's like Rick Perry.
[00:46:28.911 --> 00:46:30.572]  He's only suspended his campaign.
[00:46:30.592 --> 00:46:31.492]  He has not quit.
[00:46:32.492 --> 00:46:34.252]  So you've got just about every candidate.
[00:46:34.692 --> 00:46:39.193]  It's like I believe even Rand Paul used that language of, I'm suspending my campaign.
[00:46:39.353 --> 00:46:39.553]  Right.
[00:46:39.573 --> 00:46:43.254]  Well, they're certainly keeping things pretty exciting all the way to the very end.
[00:46:43.654 --> 00:46:44.634]  Well, stick with us, Richard.
[00:46:44.674 --> 00:46:50.655]  We're going to be taking a quick break and then we'll come right back with more commentary from you, Jakari Jackson and Darren McGreen.
[00:46:51.116 --> 00:46:53.016]  We will be right back after a short break.
[00:47:04.893 --> 00:47:05.894]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:06.435 --> 00:47:08.717]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:08.998 --> 00:47:16.847]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:21.228]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:21.248 --> 00:47:23.590]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:23.951 --> 00:47:27.494]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:27.534 --> 00:47:30.677]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:31.177 --> 00:47:35.981]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:36.522 --> 00:47:38.384]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:47:38.744 --> 00:47:43.088]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:43.328 --> 00:47:45.409]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:45.969 --> 00:47:47.490]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:47.730]  Exactly.
[00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:51.691]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:52.191 --> 00:48:00.215]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:10.114]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:10.354 --> 00:48:16.461]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:23.628]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:23.968 --> 00:48:33.920]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:40.407]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:40.647 --> 00:48:43.831]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and
[00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:45.192]  Adina Silke Bahlmann.
[00:48:45.473 --> 00:48:48.817]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:48:49.057 --> 00:48:50.699]  No needles, no injections.
[00:48:50.959 --> 00:48:52.421]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:53.622]  Try it for yourself.
[00:48:53.803 --> 00:48:54.804]  Discover the secret.
[00:48:55.044 --> 00:48:55.365]  Secret 12.
[00:48:56.105 --> 00:49:01.272]  Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:49:22.042 --> 00:49:24.084]  Welcome back to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:49:24.144 --> 00:49:27.666]  We are coming at you live for Decision Day in New Hampshire.
[00:49:27.706 --> 00:49:30.628]  Looks like they've already called it for Trump as well as Sanders.
[00:49:31.149 --> 00:49:36.433]  And of course as Richard Reeves just mentioned right before the break, they're keeping things very interesting.
[00:49:37.173 --> 00:49:40.136]  Many people just say they're going to suspend their campaign here after this.
[00:49:40.836 --> 00:49:45.141]  You know, with this loss in New Hampshire, we might see some more out of others as well.
[00:49:45.161 --> 00:49:45.662]  Well, we don't know.
[00:49:45.682 --> 00:49:47.084]  We haven't heard anybody say they're going to suspend it.
[00:49:47.104 --> 00:49:55.174]  We're just kind of speculating as to what's going to happen because Christie and Fiorina, if they stay in the positions that they are, they needed a fifth place finish.
[00:49:55.214 --> 00:49:59.580]  They're in sixth and seventh place right now, so they would not be making
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.421]  We're good to go.
[00:50:18.973 --> 00:50:20.794]  16 for Kasich, that's been kind of consistent.
[00:50:21.134 --> 00:50:25.997]  Now we see Cruz in third place, Bush dropping to fourth place just slightly.
[00:50:26.017 --> 00:50:28.139]  There's only one vote difference between them right now.
[00:50:28.699 --> 00:50:31.321]  Tide at 12 essentially, Rubio at 10, Christie at 7.
[00:50:31.921 --> 00:50:37.925]  If Rubio drops down to 9, again, all his votes belong to Donald Trump, so we'll see what happens with that.
[00:50:38.226 --> 00:50:39.667]  Alright, that'll be very interesting.
[00:50:40.007 --> 00:50:42.308]  Well, let's go ahead and go to Darren McBreen now.
[00:50:42.368 --> 00:50:43.789]  He is over at the Twitter station.
[00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:44.510]  What's going on, Darren?
[00:50:45.316 --> 00:50:51.698]  Well check this out, this is our brand new Twitter station here at the Infowars.com studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:50:51.718 --> 00:50:52.479]  Pretty cool, huh?
[00:50:52.839 --> 00:50:53.479]  Yeah, it's great.
[00:50:53.879 --> 00:50:55.860]  Well, I'll be here for the next couple of hours.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:00.862]  I'm going to be monitoring Twitter and Facebook as well as keeping a close eye on the mainstream news media.
[00:51:00.882 --> 00:51:04.243]  I want to get their reaction to tonight's primary in New Hampshire.
[00:51:04.943 --> 00:51:08.845]  So far, the good news is that Dilbert was wrong.
[00:51:09.865 --> 00:51:19.353]  There's a story on Infowars.com today about the creator of the popular cartoon series Dilbert.
[00:51:20.053 --> 00:51:27.399]  He said that the fix is in and that Marco, Mr. Roboto, Rubio was going to be the GOP.
[00:51:27.619 --> 00:51:34.565]  The GOP was going to rig it for him to win, but it looks like Rubio is sinking fast and that's the way I like it.
[00:51:35.802 --> 00:51:50.614]  Well, I know you talked about this a little bit earlier today, or possibly Watson as well, that they might go for the big rig and hope to not get caught, but if they do, it would be other minions that would be thrown to the fire.
[00:51:50.634 --> 00:51:58.000]  But we know Marco Rubio, he's the stereotypical poster child for the GOP candidates, along with Jeb Bush.
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:01.022]  So we know that those are the establishment candidates.
[00:52:01.363 --> 00:52:02.644]  But it's very interesting to see.
[00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:08.812]  I have heard that there's a big divide right now between conservatives.
[00:52:09.193 --> 00:52:15.376]  And the traditional conservatives, for example, they will still go to Fox News to watch breaking news coverage.
[00:52:15.697 --> 00:52:19.479]  But more and more people, they no longer trust the analysis of Fox News.
[00:52:19.759 --> 00:52:20.940]  So there's this division.
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:28.686]  More and more people are now going to places like the Drudge Report or Breitbart or, of course, yours truly, InfoWars.com.
[00:52:28.706 --> 00:52:31.688]  So they're abandoning Fox News.
[00:52:31.728 --> 00:52:35.571]  They no longer worship Fox, and that's just on the right-wing side, you know.
[00:52:35.871 --> 00:52:37.233]  But Donald Trump knows this.
[00:52:37.933 --> 00:52:47.619]  And that's why he's able to openly speak out, you know, even criticize people like, God forbid, say anything bad about Senator John McCain, who is a war hero, you know?
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.281]  And that's what the establishment wants you to think.
[00:52:50.601 --> 00:52:58.586]  But now if you tune into InfoWars or Breitbart or the Drudge Report, people are learning that maybe John McCain wasn't a war hero after all.
[00:52:59.827 --> 00:53:23.172]  Right, it's just so interesting to see how many people, there was a woman that was interviewed as she was exiting, and after the debate the other night, and she just talked about how Marco Rubio, well he just kept repeating himself, he's not getting my vote now, and it's so funny how now, they have always had talking points, I mean still to this day the media uses talking points, but you don't realize it if you're not switching to all the different stations, and
[00:53:23.772 --> 00:53:30.196]  You know, so it's just interesting to see how they can finally start to see behind the curtain there with the talking point.
[00:53:30.216 --> 00:53:32.297]  People are hungry for authenticity.
[00:53:32.317 --> 00:53:38.441]  They want to see authenticity, and when you pull what he did, you show that you can't think on your feet.
[00:53:38.501 --> 00:53:40.443]  You show that you're not mature.
[00:53:40.483 --> 00:53:42.964]  He's really pretty young for a senator.
[00:53:43.044 --> 00:53:44.945]  I mean, you compare him to John Kennedy.
[00:53:45.406 --> 00:53:51.790]  John Kennedy had a lot more life experience than Marco Rubio did, but you know, he's now sinking like an anchor baby.
[00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:58.574]  And I would say that's a good thing because he's not eligible to run for president, in my opinion, and neither is Ted Cruz.
[00:53:58.594 --> 00:53:59.154]  Ted Cruz, right.
[00:53:59.274 --> 00:54:00.495]  And that's a big deal, I think.
[00:54:01.215 --> 00:54:02.416]  You have to be eligible.
[00:54:02.696 --> 00:54:16.844]  You have to start, if you're going to be a candidate like Ted Cruz, and you say you're going to restore the Constitution, you're going to appoint originalist judges, then why wouldn't you go with an originalist interpretation of what a natural-born citizen is?
[00:54:17.084 --> 00:54:19.046]  You're starting out at a point of hypocrisy.
[00:54:19.526 --> 00:54:21.087]  And of course, he's playing
[00:54:21.587 --> 00:54:24.208]  Yeah, he's up to his usual tricks right now as well.
[00:54:24.489 --> 00:54:26.009]  Let's go to Jakari.
[00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:27.070]  Thank you, Darren.
[00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:28.371]  Let's go to Jakari Jackson.
[00:54:28.391 --> 00:54:28.731]  Jakari.
[00:54:29.471 --> 00:54:30.031]  Thank you, David.
[00:54:30.472 --> 00:54:35.314]  Now, we've been talking a lot about Donald Trump and the things that are going on out there in New Hampshire.
[00:54:35.354 --> 00:54:39.416]  We do have our reporters on the ground, and we will go to them when Mr. Trump takes the stage.
[00:54:39.456 --> 00:54:43.458]  But for the time being, let's talk about the other winner today, Mr. Bernie Sanders.
[00:54:43.878 --> 00:54:50.482]  Now, I know you talked about this a little bit, Leanne, when you were discussing why people are feeling the burn, so to speak.
[00:54:51.042 --> 00:54:56.126]  I had a chance to go out to the University of Texas last week, and I did a man on the street, and I asked people a very simple question.
[00:54:56.526 --> 00:54:58.387]  I said, who is your favorite presidential candidate?
[00:54:58.407 --> 00:55:01.809]  And then I asked them to follow up, and what is your favorite policy?
[00:55:01.929 --> 00:55:03.530]  And many people were feeling the burn.
[00:55:03.991 --> 00:55:05.712]  They said they like Bernie Sanders.
[00:55:05.772 --> 00:55:11.796]  The reason why is because in the programs that he's suggesting that we implement in the country, such as free college tuition.
[00:55:12.296 --> 00:55:15.659]  Now, when I asked the young lady, I said, well, who's going to pay for all this?
[00:55:16.059 --> 00:55:17.481]  You know, where do you get money for this?
[00:55:17.501 --> 00:55:20.423]  And she said, well, hopefully the rich people in America will pay for it.
[00:55:20.844 --> 00:55:26.769]  Now, if you look at Mr. Sanders plan, he does have something targeted towards, I guess, what you would refer to as the 1%.
[00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:36.640]  But also, if you look deeper into his plan to fund these programs that he's trying to implement, he also targets people who make around $250,000 a year.
[00:55:37.001 --> 00:55:42.207]  Now, that's much more than the average American makes, but that is far from the billionaire boys club of the 1%.
[00:55:42.587 --> 00:55:46.211]  So it's kind of like that old analogy of the crabs in the bucket, right?
[00:55:46.912 --> 00:55:51.755]  The crowd is trying to crawl out the bucket and they never make it out because another crowd grabs them and snatches them back down.
[00:55:52.055 --> 00:55:52.636]  It's the same thing.
[00:55:52.676 --> 00:55:59.821]  People don't make it out of the upper middle class because as soon as they're about to get up to that next level the taxes or whatever else come and snatch them back down.
[00:56:00.301 --> 00:56:03.403]  And that's something that a lot of people don't understand, especially the younger voters.
[00:56:03.763 --> 00:56:09.866]  And to be fair, you know, if I was 17, 18 years old, I'd probably be seduced by the siren song of Bernie Sanders as well.
[00:56:10.346 --> 00:56:14.388]  But we really need to have people understand this, that free stuff isn't free.
[00:56:14.728 --> 00:56:25.814]  And you college kids, you know, once you move out of mom and dad's house and you're out there paying your own bills and you make a decent amount of money, you're going to be reminded every time you look at that paycheck and you see how much taxes they take out, that free stuff is not free.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:42.239]  Yeah, you know, when you're talking about being pulled out of the, as you start to climb out of the bucket, being pulled down by tax rates, Jakari, we've got to remember that Bernie Sanders was talking about the 90 plus percent tax rates that we had suffered under in the past, the top rates.
[00:56:42.859 --> 00:56:46.781]  And even said, well, you know, Ronald Reagan had rates like that.
[00:56:46.821 --> 00:56:48.262]  Well, that's what they were when he started.
[00:56:48.302 --> 00:56:49.642]  When he got finished, they were very different.
[00:56:50.302 --> 00:56:53.744]  They lowered the tax rates and simplified the tax code quite a bit.
[00:56:53.784 --> 00:56:57.646]  That was probably the best thing that happened out of the Reagan administration.
[00:56:57.666 --> 00:56:59.907]  As a matter of fact, Ronald Reagan became a Republican
[00:57:00.447 --> 00:57:04.409]  Because he was being taxed as a Hollywood actor at 90 plus percent.
[00:57:04.809 --> 00:57:16.454]  That is socialism, and people need to understand that Bernie Sanders, 30, 35 years ago, he was going to Nicaragua, he was sucking up to the Sandinistas down there, he thought Daniel Ortega was great.
[00:57:16.894 --> 00:57:19.796]  Daniel Ortega ripped off his people.
[00:57:19.996 --> 00:57:21.197]  It was a kleptocracy.
[00:57:21.277 --> 00:57:24.580]  He stole more property there than Wall Street has ever stolen.
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:37.209]  But Daniel Ortega and the rest of these South American socialists that Bernie Sanders loves so much, I call them a Bernie Sandinista, people like Hugo Chavez, they paid the bankers that Bernie Sanders campaigns against.
[00:57:37.249 --> 00:57:38.890]  They're his piñata that he beats.
[00:57:40.351 --> 00:57:51.681]  They were paying them 700% return on investment and they're bragging in Bloomberg that the Venezuelan communists, as well as the Nicaraguan people, would always pay the bankers before they would pay the people.
[00:57:51.961 --> 00:57:57.766]  So the people there are suffering under a horrendous burden of redistribution and confiscation of property.
[00:57:58.287 --> 00:58:01.790]  Even the communists and the conservatives
[00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:09.482]  Libertarians threw out Daniel Ortega because he had stolen so much of the property that was there.
[00:58:10.023 --> 00:58:12.246]  And that's the hero of Bernie Sanders.
[00:58:12.447 --> 00:58:14.791]  That is what socialism is in the long run.
[00:58:15.219 --> 00:58:22.865]  Yes, I saw a report, I can't recall the anchor's name on Fox News, where he's talking to Ben from Ben & Jerry, the ice cream empire.
[00:58:23.305 --> 00:58:27.748]  And he's telling them, you know, Ben & Jerry guy, he's like, it's so great, I love Bernie Sanders, he was feeling the Bern.
[00:58:28.208 --> 00:58:33.312]  And the pundit, he starts naming off all these other countries that have socialism, and they're not doing so hot.
[00:58:33.452 --> 00:58:35.774]  So, you know, why can't people understand this?
[00:58:35.814 --> 00:58:41.378]  They want to bring it here, even though we have clear examples that it's not a one-size-fits-all policy that works all around the world.
[00:58:41.918 --> 00:58:49.806]  Right, well obviously when you have students being indoctrinated with this socialism for decades, it's not a wonder that they're going to come out with these ideals.
[00:58:49.846 --> 00:58:55.551]  And of course they don't want to look at what's not working, not when there's a utopia to be had.
[00:58:55.851 --> 00:58:57.353]  Well stick around, we'll be right back.
[00:59:05.427 --> 00:59:06.788]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:08.350]  You can't survive without it.
[00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:09.471]  But where do you get it?
[00:59:09.771 --> 00:59:15.516]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand-new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:59:15.756 --> 00:59:21.482]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:59:21.682 --> 00:59:29.429]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities.
[00:59:32.111 --> 00:59:32.631]  We're good to go!
[00:59:49.281 --> 00:59:50.061]  Fool me once, shame on you.
[00:59:50.121 --> 00:59:51.482]  Fool me twice, shame on me.
[00:59:51.502 --> 00:59:52.882]  Vote for Jeb, or you're just f***ing stupid.
[01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:21.899]  Boom, we can't get fooled again.
[01:01:03.482 --> 01:01:05.123]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[01:01:05.463 --> 01:01:09.006]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:11.888]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[01:01:12.208 --> 01:01:15.630]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:19.553]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts.
[01:01:19.693 --> 01:01:20.033]  I'm good.
[01:01:43.897 --> 01:01:45.278]  It's never going to get any better.
[01:01:45.318 --> 01:01:45.878]  Don't look for it.
[01:01:45.919 --> 01:01:46.819]  Be happy with what you got.
[01:02:12.808 --> 01:02:15.869]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[01:02:16.409 --> 01:02:18.050]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:24.111]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[01:02:24.492 --> 01:02:25.712]  Forget the politicians.
[01:02:25.932 --> 01:02:29.193]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[01:02:30.793 --> 01:02:31.254]  You don't.
[01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:32.994]  You have no choice.
[01:02:33.374 --> 01:02:34.294]  You have owners.
[01:02:34.595 --> 01:02:35.535]  They own you.
[01:02:36.866 --> 01:02:38.167]  They own everything.
[01:02:38.408 --> 01:02:40.050]  They own all the important land.
[01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:42.152]  They own and control the corporations.
[01:02:42.172 --> 01:02:45.655]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls.
[01:02:45.676 --> 01:02:47.257]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[01:02:47.598 --> 01:02:52.403]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[01:02:52.583 --> 01:02:54.225]  They got you by the balls!
[01:02:55.706 --> 01:02:57.767]  They want obedient workers.
[01:02:58.247 --> 01:02:59.748]  Obedient workers.
[01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:12.753]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[01:03:12.833 --> 01:03:16.075]  And now they're coming for your social security money.
[01:03:16.555 --> 01:03:19.216]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[01:03:20.616 --> 01:03:21.537]  It's a big club.
[01:03:22.509 --> 01:03:23.350]  And you ain't in it.
[01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:26.633]  You and I are not in the big club.
[01:03:27.013 --> 01:03:28.975]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[01:03:29.595 --> 01:03:33.318]  It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.261]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[01:03:36.601 --> 01:03:40.084]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[01:03:40.104 --> 01:03:44.007]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[01:03:44.027 --> 01:03:45.008]  They're not interested in that.
[01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:46.249]  That doesn't help them.
[01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:48.011]  That's against their interest.
[01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:48.872]  That's right.
[01:04:31.596 --> 01:04:33.738]  Welcome back to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[01:04:33.758 --> 01:04:39.184]  We're going to be live here for about another hour wrapping up the New Hampshire primaries.
[01:04:39.244 --> 01:04:41.786]  The results are still coming in, but they've already called it.
[01:04:42.047 --> 01:04:47.572]  Of course, we might just see if a certain number of delegates are allocated to Donald Trump here.
[01:04:48.482 --> 01:05:07.098]  Of course what's interesting is who's going to come in second and third and whether or not Rubio or Christie are going to fall below the 10% threshold because if they do then their votes are going to, if they fall below that 10% threshold, their votes will be rolled over to Donald Trump and he will pick up delegates proportionately for that.
[01:05:08.157 --> 01:05:15.160]  Now, critics were saying that Hillary Clinton, she is swimming for her life here before these primaries.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.281]  And of course, as we're seeing, it's not looking too good for her.
[01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:17.941]  She's at 40%.
[01:05:18.421 --> 01:05:19.642]  Sanders is already at 58%.
[01:05:20.242 --> 01:05:24.363]  And this is even when the game was sort of rigged in her favor going in.
[01:05:25.184 --> 01:05:26.804]  She had six delegates there.
[01:05:28.505 --> 01:05:40.688]  And here's the interesting thing, Leigh-Anne, as I mentioned earlier, CNN with their exit polls, they were asking the Democrats what they were looking for, what the most important qualification was for them in terms of a candidate.
[01:05:41.028 --> 01:05:44.389]  Now, 32% said they wanted a candidate who was honest and trustworthy.
[01:05:44.409 --> 01:05:47.610]  27% were looking for a candidate who cares about people.
[01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:48.990]  So that's 59%.
[01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:52.091]  If you look at these votes, Sanders is now at 58%.
[01:05:53.911 --> 01:06:01.875]  In other words, the people who are looking for honest, trustworthy, and caring about people, they're breaking for Sanders almost exactly like this exit poll.
[01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:03.315]  Then, you look at the other side.
[01:06:03.335 --> 01:06:09.438]  27% were looking for a candidate who had the right experience, and 13% said electability.
[01:06:09.898 --> 01:06:12.860]  That adds up to 40%, and that's where Clinton is right now.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.641]  I think that's pretty much the way this thing is breaking down.
[01:06:16.061 --> 01:06:21.842]  Clinton has an integrity issue, to say the least, even with Democrats.
[01:06:21.982 --> 01:06:29.243]  And it's going to really hurt her in the general election because that is going to be hammered on, especially if Trump is the nominee.
[01:06:29.524 --> 01:06:33.924]  They're going to look at her past, including her war on women and other issues.
[01:06:33.964 --> 01:06:37.125]  There are so many different issues about her integrity that are there.
[01:06:37.345 --> 01:06:38.765]  And that's what's behind these numbers.
[01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:42.746]  But the other thing that's going on here is an NBC exit polling.
[01:06:43.126 --> 01:06:55.615]  They were looking at how people are lining up ideologically in the Democrat Party and there they had 68% said Sanders was about right on the issues and 26% only said that he was too liberal.
[01:06:55.675 --> 01:06:59.438]  So there's a massive surge to the left because we look at what they said about Hillary Clinton.
[01:07:00.178 --> 01:07:04.999]  55% said, well, she's about right on the issues, but 34% said she wasn't liberal enough.
[01:07:05.479 --> 01:07:08.720]  So the perception is, is that she's not liberal enough.
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.521]  Bernie Sanders is about right on the issues.
[01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:21.923]  In other words, they have moved radically towards socialism, but they also are moving away from somebody that they perceive as being a crook and a criminal like Hillary Clinton.
[01:07:21.943 --> 01:07:24.564]  That's really what's behind the numbers on the Democrat side, I think.
[01:07:25.066 --> 01:07:33.114]  Right now I know when I was going to University of Texas that we were learning about that, that there was actually this really hard shift to the left.
[01:07:33.214 --> 01:07:43.284]  And what you always hear in the liberal media is that the right is getting even more conservative, but it actually, they've moved very little to the right over the last decades.
[01:07:43.344 --> 01:07:44.265]  And of course the other part of this...
[01:07:45.026 --> 01:07:47.028]  Yeah, but the other part of this is also age.
[01:07:47.408 --> 01:08:04.441]  And of course the younger people are more liberal and it is because of college and I'm telling you, that's why, exactly, that's why Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party want there to be perpetual college students getting free tuition because it's not education, it's indoctrination.
[01:08:04.721 --> 01:08:06.343]  But let's look at this integrity issue here.
[01:08:06.843 --> 01:08:09.085]  There's an interesting story that broke today on Gawker.
[01:08:09.626 --> 01:08:12.468]  This is how Hillary Clinton gets the coverage that she wants.
[01:08:12.708 --> 01:08:16.932]  And I think that this really tells us what's going on with the emails.
[01:08:17.112 --> 01:08:28.122]  It's really more of an issue, I think, with this private server and these emails that she got and the reason that she wants to guard this so closely really comes out in this Gawker story.
[01:08:28.382 --> 01:08:35.068]  Now what they did was they filed a Freedom of Information request with the State Department to try to get to some of these emails.
[01:08:35.208 --> 01:08:45.438]  And what they found was an exchange going back and forth with a political editor from the Atlantic, going back and forth with Philip Raines, Clinton's spokesperson.
[01:08:45.958 --> 01:08:48.881]  Okay, now in this exchange going back and forth,
[01:08:49.321 --> 01:09:11.161]  The Clinton spokesperson, Philip Raines, says to the Atlantic's political editor that they will give him an advanced transcript of a speech, but they dictate that if they do that, basically blackmailing him, saying that if we give you this advanced access to the transcript, you are going to describe her speech as muscular.
[01:09:11.181 --> 01:09:11.682]  Muscular.
[01:09:11.722 --> 01:09:12.743]  Muscular, okay?
[01:09:13.303 --> 01:09:13.824]  And he did.
[01:09:14.344 --> 01:09:16.726]  It was essentially they blackmailed him into doing it.
[01:09:16.766 --> 01:09:25.673]  He played ball with them at the Atlantic and that's what is going on and you're going to find a lot of that type of stuff that's going to be hidden in these Clinton emails.
[01:09:26.074 --> 01:09:31.438]  That's the kind of arm twisting and blackmailing that Clinton is capable of.
[01:09:31.518 --> 01:09:36.022]  This is a very small issue compared to the other stuff that is buried in there.
[01:09:36.102 --> 01:09:43.268]  I can guarantee you there's a lot of really hardball blackmail in there and there's a lot of people who don't want that information to come out.
[01:09:43.288 --> 01:09:50.393]  It would be a lot more embarrassing than a political editor being muscled into using the word muscular.
[01:09:51.134 --> 01:09:55.437]  There's a lot of real dirt that's going to come out on the people that Hillary Clinton is blackmailing.
[01:09:55.757 --> 01:10:04.224]  That's why the Washington establishment is closing in on her, trying to hide these emails, even though it's clear that she broke the law.
[01:10:04.304 --> 01:10:10.008]  They don't want full disclosure because stuff like this is going to come out, much worse stuff than this is going to come out.
[01:10:10.188 --> 01:10:19.273]  Right, and I feel like that's why, that was the feeling that I got from her when she sort of gave that smirk that nobody controls me and I can't be made to do it.
[01:10:19.333 --> 01:10:25.237]  It was almost like she was giving them a wink that I own you, I control you, I'll take you down with me.
[01:10:25.737 --> 01:10:34.442]  And it'd be pretty interesting to see what other media outlets out there had made these arrangements with the Clinton campaign, with the Clintons really.
[01:10:34.502 --> 01:10:37.964]  I mean they've always been sort of shielded from any of that negative
[01:10:39.564 --> 01:10:49.268]  Well, what would really be interesting is to see all the emails going on in that corrupt swamp we call Washington, D.C.
[01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:49.588]  Yes.
[01:10:49.828 --> 01:10:57.251]  All the dirt and the skeletons that she's got on all the different political people that she's got buried in those email servers of hers.
[01:10:57.271 --> 01:10:59.392]  Let's take a look at what's going on with Cruz.
[01:10:59.612 --> 01:11:01.413]  And this is an interesting article from Politico.
[01:11:02.233 --> 01:11:05.194]  Cruz seeks to raise expectations for Rubio.
[01:11:05.274 --> 01:11:09.716]  Remember the expectations game that he played so effectively against Donald Trump.
[01:11:10.796 --> 01:11:12.917]  Essentially he was going back and forth.
[01:11:12.937 --> 01:11:14.778]  They were exchanging the lead in Iowa.
[01:11:15.298 --> 01:11:19.259]  We would see one of them three or four points ahead and then it would switch and go back the other way.
[01:11:19.299 --> 01:11:23.441]  And of course that is typically within the margin of error of a poll.
[01:11:23.521 --> 01:11:27.323]  Even if they do it honestly, they've got a margin of error four to five percent.
[01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:28.103]  So basically
[01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:38.645]  What the establishment did, what Cruz did, was to say, well, you know, Donald Trump was expected to beat me by 3 or 4 percent, he lost to me by 3 or 4 percent, so he's a loser, okay, and I'm the big winner, alright?
[01:11:39.186 --> 01:11:41.166]  He's doing the same thing to Marco Rubio.
[01:11:41.646 --> 01:11:53.649]  And what he did was, he said, he was telling people, he says, the big question in the New Hampshire primary, can Rubio beat Trump for first place finish as Cruz did in Iowa?
[01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:54.849]  This is what they tweeted out.
[01:11:54.909 --> 01:11:57.510]  This is what his campaign strategist tweeted out.
[01:11:57.890 --> 01:12:03.772]  Now, it was never in the cards that Rubio was even within striking distance of Donald Trump.
[01:12:03.812 --> 01:12:08.573]  Donald Trump always had a 15 to 20 point lead in New Hampshire.
[01:12:08.873 --> 01:12:16.315]  So there was absolutely no way that there was a neck-and-neck race for first place in New Hampshire between Rubio and Trump.
[01:12:16.495 --> 01:12:22.857]  But that's the kind of expectation game and the kind of backdoor, sneaky, political maneuvering
[01:12:23.197 --> 01:12:25.898]  That we're coming to expect from Ted Cruz.
[01:12:25.918 --> 01:12:26.558]  That's what we're seeing.
[01:12:26.858 --> 01:12:29.018]  Now, this is what Ted Cruz himself said.
[01:12:29.058 --> 01:12:40.061]  According to Politico, they say a day earlier, speaking to reporters in Raymond, New Hampshire, Cruz also mischievously, that's their word, suggested that Rubio was in striking distance of poll leader Donald Trump.
[01:12:40.081 --> 01:12:42.261]  So it's not just the tweets, but he's saying it himself.
[01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:48.143]  And he said, there's a lot of speculation that Donald and Marco might tie for first here, Cruz said.
[01:12:48.203 --> 01:12:48.823]  That's possible.
[01:12:49.443 --> 01:12:49.944]  No it isn't.
[01:12:50.264 --> 01:12:50.785]  No it isn't.
[01:12:50.845 --> 01:12:53.828]  He's lying about that and he's playing that expectations game.
[01:12:54.649 --> 01:13:08.924]  And then he goes on to say, took another jab at Rubio, he said, these elections are decided not from a TV studio in Manhattan or DC, not by a bunch of slick Hollywood television ads, they're decided in VFW halls.
[01:13:09.204 --> 01:13:13.165]  They're decided in living rooms of the men and women of Iowa, the men and women of New Hampshire.
[01:13:13.205 --> 01:13:14.926]  They're decided in Dunkin' Donuts.
[01:13:14.986 --> 01:13:15.586]  And you know what else?
[01:13:16.006 --> 01:13:22.348]  They're decided in caucuses when they spread the rumors just as the caucus is starting.
[01:13:22.368 --> 01:13:23.508]  And that's what we saw happen.
[01:13:23.528 --> 01:13:26.309]  That's the dirty tricks that he pulled in Iowa.
[01:13:26.349 --> 01:13:27.349]  That's how he got that.
[01:13:27.609 --> 01:13:30.850]  And that's from the so-called Christian candidate.
[01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:35.432]  Well, speaking of expectation games, let's go ahead and go to Hillary Clinton.
[01:13:35.472 --> 01:13:37.653]  She's giving her speech now.
[01:13:37.693 --> 01:13:39.454]  She said she'd be happy to come in second.
[01:13:40.395 --> 01:13:41.755]  In a two-way race, yeah.
[01:13:41.975 --> 01:13:42.796]  Well, she got her wish.
[01:13:44.657 --> 01:13:45.777]  Only 18 points behind.
[01:13:45.797 --> 01:13:48.559]  Senator Sanders on his victory tonight.
[01:13:48.979 --> 01:13:51.380]  And I want to thank each and every one of you.
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:57.163]  And I want to say, I still love New Hampshire and I always will.
[01:13:59.949 --> 01:14:01.791]  What difference does it make?
[01:14:01.831 --> 01:14:02.872]  Yeah, what difference does it make?
[01:14:02.892 --> 01:14:03.793]  What difference does it make?
[01:14:04.073 --> 01:14:05.974]  That's what she should have done.
[01:14:06.135 --> 01:14:08.377]  And I want to remind everybody, I still have 422 delegates.
[01:14:08.397 --> 01:14:08.477]  Wow.
[01:14:08.557 --> 01:14:09.458]  There's that word difference.
[01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:13.221]  What difference does it make?
[01:14:26.345 --> 01:14:31.169]  The way too many things were going just wasn't right.
[01:14:32.089 --> 01:14:36.773]  It isn't right that the kids I met were part of it were poisoned because their daughter wanted to save money.
[01:14:36.793 --> 01:14:39.194]  It isn't right for a grandmother in New Hampshire or anywhere else
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:55.944]  They have to choose between paying rent and buying medicine because a prescription drug company increased the price 4,000% overnight.
[01:14:56.585 --> 01:14:57.325]  And it isn't right.
[01:14:58.846 --> 01:15:01.447]  It's all Martin Shkreli's fault.
[01:15:01.487 --> 01:15:02.548]  That's it.
[01:15:02.568 --> 01:15:03.688]  No one else is to blame.
[01:15:03.808 --> 01:15:05.329]  Is he a millennial?
[01:15:05.449 --> 01:15:07.690]  Or is he a Gen Y-er?
[01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:08.431]  He's young.
[01:15:08.631 --> 01:15:12.753]  Well you know those grandmothers could fix their economic problems if they just give some speeches to Goldman Sachs.
[01:15:13.873 --> 01:15:14.594]  No problem at all.
[01:15:14.654 --> 01:15:19.459]  I hear they pay really well if you suck up to them.
[01:15:19.519 --> 01:15:20.480]  Finger wag them.
[01:15:21.681 --> 01:15:23.703]  You bad banks, don't you do that again.
[01:15:23.723 --> 01:15:29.248]  That is the fight we're taking to the country.
[01:15:29.308 --> 01:15:35.554]  What is the best way to change people's lives so we can all grow together?
[01:15:35.574 --> 01:15:36.475]  Thanks to Hillary.
[01:15:38.786 --> 01:15:41.087]  They do definitely want to change people's lives, though.
[01:15:41.507 --> 01:15:44.349]  I just don't think they're going to be satisfied with it when it happens.
[01:15:44.769 --> 01:15:49.611]  I will work harder than anyone to actually make the changes.
[01:15:50.271 --> 01:15:53.473]  We can't have everybody having air conditioning.
[01:15:53.593 --> 01:15:54.874]  The planet will burn up.
[01:15:54.914 --> 01:15:56.915]  About Washington and about Wall Street.
[01:15:57.195 --> 01:15:59.196]  But everyone can have free indoctrination.
[01:15:59.296 --> 01:16:00.316]  I mean college.
[01:16:00.896 --> 01:16:03.918]  Secret, unaccountable money out of politics.
[01:16:04.638 --> 01:16:06.039]  Ooh, let's start with you.
[01:16:06.059 --> 01:16:08.460]  You go first.
[01:16:08.961 --> 01:16:09.101]  Wow.
[01:16:09.321 --> 01:16:12.723]  Well, I guess she got it out of politics.
[01:16:12.763 --> 01:16:14.624]  She put it into her foundation.
[01:16:14.644 --> 01:16:16.005]  That's right.
[01:16:16.085 --> 01:16:18.727]  Just funnels right into her security.
[01:16:18.747 --> 01:16:23.509]  $4 million to Haiti and only eight huts built for people?
[01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:24.050]  Yeah.
[01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.690]  Yeah, you know.
[01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:25.391]  Yeah, you know.
[01:16:25.811 --> 01:16:32.455]  She just mentioned Citizens United, and it's interesting because CNN's Lobi Anka and Ashley Killough said,
[01:16:33.215 --> 01:16:34.556]  We're good to go.
[01:16:52.383 --> 01:16:52.763]  Sad.
[01:16:52.803 --> 01:16:53.083]  Loser.
[01:17:11.351 --> 01:17:16.113]  Well, see, that's the way that they can distance themselves and try to look honest, okay?
[01:17:16.373 --> 01:17:22.877]  And say, yeah, this is a horrible thing that these corporations are putting together unlimited amounts of money on this.
[01:17:23.317 --> 01:17:24.898]  And, you know, it's just awful.
[01:17:24.978 --> 01:17:30.640]  And yet they are the ones who have their fingers in the pot more than anybody else.
[01:17:31.081 --> 01:17:33.522]  The problem is not going to be solved
[01:17:33.942 --> 01:17:38.324]  By putting artificial constraints on what people can spend on free speech.
[01:17:38.604 --> 01:17:38.884]  Okay?
[01:17:39.024 --> 01:17:41.105]  I agree in principle with Citizen United.
[01:17:41.225 --> 01:17:45.747]  I think the problem is we've got too much power and influence in Washington.
[01:17:45.987 --> 01:17:50.949]  And as long as you've got that much power and influence in Washington, it will breed corruption.
[01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.309]  It's
[01:18:09.813 --> 01:18:15.097]  For the graft and corruption, if the loot and the power isn't as concentrated in Washington.
[01:18:15.178 --> 01:18:19.401]  And again, that is the same thing we're seeing, I believe, with the open borders issue.
[01:18:19.421 --> 01:18:21.223]  You're not going to stop it with a wall.
[01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:27.408]  You're going to stop it only when you remove the pot of gold at the end as an incentive.
[01:18:27.428 --> 01:18:36.756]  You know, when you've got the war on drugs and when you've got the welfare state here in the United States, as long as those things are in place, you will never be able to
[01:18:37.256 --> 01:18:40.197]  Hey guys, Hillary just mentioned that she's going to rein in Wall Street when she is president.
[01:18:40.217 --> 01:18:41.677]  She just said those words came out of her mouth.
[01:18:55.362 --> 01:18:57.743]  But did she mean R-E-I-G-N?
[01:18:57.963 --> 01:18:59.224]  She's going to reign at Wall Street?
[01:18:59.244 --> 01:19:02.746]  She's going to reign over Wall Street and her speaking fees are going to double.
[01:19:02.946 --> 01:19:08.149]  It's all double speak here coming out of the mouth of Hillary Clinton.
[01:19:08.169 --> 01:19:10.130]  It's double speaking fees.
[01:19:10.150 --> 01:19:11.230]  Double speaking fees.
[01:19:11.871 --> 01:19:14.652]  News speak fees.
[01:19:14.812 --> 01:19:16.513]  You better hashtag that right away.
[01:19:16.533 --> 01:19:17.073]  Dews News.
[01:19:18.394 --> 01:19:24.080]  Well, it'll be interesting because they're saying her speeches to Goldman Sachs, they had some people that were actually there in attendance.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:36.312]  They said she sounded more like a member of the board, complimenting them on what a great job they were doing and their diversity and everything, not scolding them for causing the financial collapse.
[01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:39.775]  She doesn't want those speech notes released.
[01:19:39.855 --> 01:19:43.277]  She sounded like an executive of Goldman Sachs is what they said in this political story.
[01:19:43.297 --> 01:19:53.661]  And then the last paragraph of that story said, the person who saw Clinton's Arizona remarks to Goldman Sachs said they thought there was no chance the campaign would ever release them.
[01:19:53.761 --> 01:19:58.003]  Quote, it would bury her against Sanders, this person said.
[01:19:58.364 --> 01:20:01.685]  It really makes her look like an ally of the firm.
[01:20:01.885 --> 01:20:05.707]  And that's basically what's going to, that's why they're going to keep that quiet.
[01:20:06.047 --> 01:20:08.689]  It confirms that she's an ally of the firm.
[01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:12.132]  It doesn't make her look, I mean... Makes her look like a managing director, they said.
[01:20:12.232 --> 01:20:23.020]  Well, you know, that's the thing with the country waking up and not being able to be brainwashed by the media out there is that this is why her likability rating is so low.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.321]  People get it.
[01:20:24.601 --> 01:20:26.002]  She can say whatever she wants.
[01:20:26.122 --> 01:20:28.364]  It's all the same things, but they can see the lies.
[01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:29.524]  They see the hypocrisy.
[01:20:30.245 --> 01:20:32.667]  The media can't bat away all of her scandals.
[01:20:32.847 --> 01:20:35.409]  It's starting to, she's getting buried in them.
[01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:36.433]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:36.453 --> 01:20:37.477]  We can always help.
[01:20:40.376 --> 01:20:40.756]  I don't know.
[01:20:41.317 --> 01:20:42.478]  She seems to have nine lives.
[01:20:42.738 --> 01:20:46.580]  And this is precisely, you know, Larry Nichols, we've talked to him a number of times.
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.502]  Alex Jones interviewed him last Thursday.
[01:20:49.062 --> 01:20:53.085]  And Larry Nichols repeated again, he says she really does need to lose New Hampshire.
[01:20:53.145 --> 01:20:57.868]  She needs as part of their game for them to be the underdog and to come back.
[01:20:57.908 --> 01:21:02.631]  We just recently saw the movie Seabiscuit and that was a key thing for that horse.
[01:21:03.132 --> 01:21:09.256]  It would get out ahead of the other horses and the jockey would have to pull him back so he could look another horse in the eye.
[01:21:09.896 --> 01:21:11.176]  And that would get him fired.
[01:21:11.216 --> 01:21:16.377]  Pull him back, slow him down, let him look at that other horse, and that would get up his competitive spirit.
[01:21:16.717 --> 01:21:22.459]  And that's what she needs for her organization to make the appeal to people, to really get people fired up.
[01:21:22.479 --> 01:21:23.639]  The same thing Seabiscuit did.
[01:21:23.699 --> 01:21:27.100]  Pull him back, put yourself in second place for a moment, and then pull ahead.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.340]  And that's really part of their game plan.
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.581]  So it really isn't something that is hurting her that much.
[01:21:31.961 --> 01:21:34.361]  She still, I repeat, has 422 superdelegates, and Sanders only has
[01:21:39.162 --> 01:21:39.982]  One, I think?
[01:21:40.042 --> 01:21:40.162]  Right.
[01:21:40.282 --> 01:21:41.262]  He's got one percent.
[01:21:41.422 --> 01:21:42.903]  He's got thirty-some-odd.
[01:21:42.963 --> 01:21:43.383]  One percent.
[01:21:43.583 --> 01:21:44.583]  Chess, sixty-two percent.
[01:21:44.823 --> 01:21:46.603]  He has one percent of the superdelegates.
[01:21:46.803 --> 01:21:48.764]  Well, and that's, you know, getting money out of politics.
[01:21:48.844 --> 01:21:52.525]  Even when you leave Washington, then you can just become a superdelegate.
[01:21:53.185 --> 01:22:04.767]  So you still retain your power, especially if you're unpledged, which means you're not devoted to any side, and they can come to you and say, please, I need your... Well, where they go to cash in is they go to K Street.
[01:22:04.787 --> 01:22:05.687]  They become a lobbyist.
[01:22:06.127 --> 01:22:06.347]  Right.
[01:22:06.447 --> 01:22:07.649]  And that's a key part of it.
[01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:09.270]  And that's the part of the revolving door.
[01:22:09.290 --> 01:22:12.314]  But of course, in Hillary Clinton's case, she didn't become a lobbyist.
[01:22:12.974 --> 01:22:17.399]  She became a speech maker and raconteur, right?
[01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:18.741]  I guess we could say a racketeer.
[01:22:18.861 --> 01:22:19.461]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:23.382 --> 01:22:35.531]  Well it's also interesting as well the way that they're trying to sell Cruz as someone that's being against the establishment and really they were hoping for a strong second place once again for Rubio.
[01:22:35.631 --> 01:22:45.058]  He was trying to make the case that he would be the best one there in opposition to Trump or Cruz with the GOP elites thinking that they're absolutely unelectable Cruz or Trump.
[01:22:45.618 --> 01:22:50.841]  But Cruz, and I've been saying this, I don't see him as anti-establishment.
[01:22:51.042 --> 01:23:07.132]  I see him as someone who has put on the mask of the Tea Party, and then there's things that go on behind the scenes, and he's able to say, oh well, you know, I am actually literally in bed with the big banks, but that's fine.
[01:23:07.152 --> 01:23:08.012]  I'm not, you know.
[01:23:08.032 --> 01:23:10.214]  Cruz got elected less than four years ago.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.661]  And he immediately started running for president.
[01:23:14.121 --> 01:23:18.383]  And one of the things that he did when he ran for president was he would trash his colleagues.
[01:23:18.423 --> 01:23:28.328]  That's why he is so hated in the Senate, is because he wanted to portray himself as being an outsider by throwing his other colleagues under the bus.
[01:23:28.388 --> 01:23:29.908]  And I have to say, they deserved it.
[01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:32.790]  I mean, when he called Mitch McConnell a liar, he was right.
[01:23:33.450 --> 01:23:36.392]  But that's why he's hated by the people in the Senate.
[01:23:36.452 --> 01:23:37.593]  He was on the fast track.
[01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:39.714]  He didn't want the job as Senate.
[01:23:39.774 --> 01:23:42.736]  He just saw that as a stepping stone.
[01:23:42.856 --> 01:23:45.818]  Immediately began campaigning for president.
[01:23:45.858 --> 01:23:50.181]  The other people resented that as well as his jabs that he took at them.
[01:23:50.621 --> 01:23:56.245]  But when you look at things that he did in terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, again, they haven't had the vote on it.
[01:23:56.325 --> 01:23:59.327]  They voted on the Trade Promotion Authority.
[01:23:59.847 --> 01:24:05.693]  Which was a vote to subvert the constitutional requirement for ratifying a treaty.
[01:24:06.213 --> 01:24:12.499]  And Ted Cruz voted in favor of taking away the constitutional ratification process.
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:16.563]  And then when it didn't count, he came back and said, well, I'm going to vote against it.
[01:24:16.603 --> 01:24:17.504]  But not for that reason.
[01:24:17.904 --> 01:24:22.965]  He didn't say he was voting against the TPA because it violated the constitutional requirements for a treaty.
[01:24:23.265 --> 01:24:35.749]  He didn't say he was voting against it because he didn't favor the TPP because it was a power grab that had been negotiated in secret, that it was a massive transfer of sovereignty, as Senator Sessions said.
[01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:40.950]  He didn't go and look at the document, as Senator Sessions did.
[01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:58.018]  So we look at this and when I look at the positions that he took that were, he's been vocal about some conservative issues, about some libertarian issues, he even called for the abolishment of the income tax and that's easy to do when you're a senator and you're just there for two years so that you can run for president.
[01:24:58.419 --> 01:25:02.401]  We've got Richard Reeves back on the line here at the Trump Watch Party.
[01:25:02.561 --> 01:25:02.801]  Richard?
[01:25:04.298 --> 01:25:33.851]  Yes sir, David, thanks for coming back to us here and it looks like one thing to be concerned about, I hate to be the little boy cries wolf, but you know, David, you and I talked about this last week where the polls have been going about 67%, 70% anti-establishment in the Republican Party when you added up Trump, Carson, Rand Paul, Fiorina, Ted Cruz, all the outside candidates.
[01:25:34.403 --> 01:25:36.806]  And tonight, it's shaking out differently.
[01:25:36.846 --> 01:25:45.436]  Tonight, it's looking like it's shaking out 54-55% outside candidates, 45% establishment candidates.
[01:25:46.137 --> 01:25:48.019]  That's a concern right there.
[01:25:48.059 --> 01:25:51.543]  That does not match the national polls that we've been seeing.
[01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:54.871]  Yeah, we'll have to see how that breaks.
[01:25:55.151 --> 01:26:02.453]  Again, most of the people who said that they were looking for an outside candidate, they broke for Trump.
[01:26:02.513 --> 01:26:05.773]  Only, I think it was 57% of them said that they were voting for Trump.
[01:26:05.853 --> 01:26:09.154]  Only 12% believed that Cruz was the outsider candidate.
[01:26:11.274 --> 01:26:12.034]  Right, right.
[01:26:12.074 --> 01:26:21.316]  But the thing of it is, that's the concern though, is that it looks like, at least in New Hampshire, what we're seeing is a creep up where people are supposedly
[01:26:22.037 --> 01:26:23.058]  Turning to the establishment.
[01:26:23.098 --> 01:26:24.198]  I don't necessarily believe that.
[01:26:24.278 --> 01:26:30.122]  I think, like I said, this delegate race, they wanted to get these candidates up over the... Oh, we've got Donald Trump.
[01:26:30.282 --> 01:26:31.043]  We've got Donald Trump.
[01:26:31.283 --> 01:26:32.403]  Yeah, there he is.
[01:26:32.443 --> 01:26:35.285]  No, it's not Donald Trump, it's Bernie Sanders.
[01:26:35.465 --> 01:26:36.746]  Okay, yeah, I saw it.
[01:26:36.786 --> 01:26:38.607]  It faked me out a little bit.
[01:26:38.767 --> 01:26:40.088]  Anyway, something to watch.
[01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:43.570]  Yeah, we'll make sure we come to you when Trump goes on.
[01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:49.194]  Let's go ahead and hear Bernie Sanders and his winning speech.
[01:26:49.594 --> 01:27:02.297]  I gotta say, his speech was, uh, when you compare his speech to Hillary Clinton's in Iowa, I mean, she came out and
[01:27:02.694 --> 01:27:03.515]  Yeah, this is great.
[01:27:03.575 --> 01:27:04.255]  I won, I won.
[01:27:04.335 --> 01:27:06.017]  And it really was still up in the air.
[01:27:06.057 --> 01:27:09.039]  And he says, well, we haven't really determined what's going on here.
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:10.801]  And he was gracious.
[01:27:11.762 --> 01:27:17.446]  At the point he came out and made his speech, he was gracious about O'Malley dropping out.
[01:27:17.486 --> 01:27:21.009]  He said he ran an honest, issues-based campaign and had kind words for him.
[01:27:21.249 --> 01:27:22.831]  Hillary was all about herself.
[01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:24.631]  And that's her big problem.
[01:27:24.691 --> 01:27:25.992]  She cannot hide that.
[01:27:26.312 --> 01:27:28.073]  And that's really his strength.
[01:27:28.293 --> 01:27:32.174]  I mean, I absolutely oppose his socialism.
[01:27:32.274 --> 01:27:33.874]  His policies are abhorrent.
[01:27:33.935 --> 01:27:37.136]  They will destroy this country if he's able to get that through.
[01:27:37.196 --> 01:27:45.418]  But I can understand why the liberals, who really are socialists when it comes down to it, and the Democrat Party, why they would like Bernie Sanders.
[01:27:45.458 --> 01:27:46.058]  He certainly is
[01:27:47.859 --> 01:27:52.601]  He comes across as a more authentic person, a kinder person than Hillary Clinton.
[01:27:52.921 --> 01:27:54.502]  That's not saying all that much.
[01:27:54.522 --> 01:27:55.583]  That's a pretty low standard.
[01:27:55.623 --> 01:27:57.423]  But yeah, he beats her by a mile.
[01:27:57.603 --> 01:28:09.329]  And that's the thing that I find so interesting is that he's a 70-something year old white guy that's been in politics for decades and people under 30 love him.
[01:28:09.469 --> 01:28:10.209]  They're just eating it up.
[01:28:10.309 --> 01:28:11.030]  He's one of us.
[01:28:12.458 --> 01:28:17.700]  Especially in a time of such great racial division and sort of age division there.
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.221]  Yeah, that's an interesting thing.
[01:28:19.241 --> 01:28:20.641]  That's something that he's done.
[01:28:20.681 --> 01:28:24.243]  He's used music very effectively, just as Donald Trump has in his rallies.
[01:28:24.263 --> 01:28:30.505]  Of course, the music that Bernie Sanders is using is 60s music, like Simon & Garfunkel.
[01:28:30.525 --> 01:28:33.727]  So it's going to appeal to the Catcher in the Rye crowd, okay?
[01:28:33.987 --> 01:28:37.908]  He really is an old, ragged Che Guevara t-shirt.
[01:28:39.549 --> 01:28:44.034]  That has come across to people as being kind of chic, you know, when they do it.
[01:28:44.094 --> 01:28:46.216]  But we'll see what happens.
[01:28:46.416 --> 01:28:48.018]  People talk about Ronald Reagan being old.
[01:28:48.038 --> 01:28:50.200]  You know, Ronald Reagan was 69 when he became president.
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:54.104]  If Bernie Sanders were to win, he would be 75 when he takes office.
[01:28:55.305 --> 01:28:58.008]  And people really aren't talking about his age, interestingly enough.
[01:28:58.228 --> 01:28:59.608]  Yeah, no, well that was the big thing.
[01:28:59.688 --> 01:29:04.350]  They were talking about Hillary Clinton's age at the beginning, which of course she was saying was sexist.
[01:29:04.810 --> 01:29:14.173]  And then you have Bernie Sanders come along and that issue was completely dropped because I guess they, and then you've got O'Malley out there taking his shirt off at every turn, sort of saying, I'm not old.
[01:29:14.193 --> 01:29:18.774]  Well, you know, Bernie Sanders may be in better physical condition than Hillary Clinton.
[01:29:19.114 --> 01:29:25.556]  He hasn't had a situation where he had a coughing fit for two minutes and couldn't speak and that's happened to her more than once.
[01:29:26.007 --> 01:29:27.008]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:27.048 --> 01:29:32.211]  And I know that Matt Drudge has alluded to that a lot, saying she's basically just a head on a stick at this point.
[01:29:32.992 --> 01:29:34.413]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:34.713 --> 01:29:38.676]  Or saying that she might wind up being a head in a jar.
[01:29:38.696 --> 01:29:40.737]  A brain in a jar.
[01:29:41.458 --> 01:29:41.898]  I don't know.
[01:29:41.998 --> 01:29:45.701]  Guys, what about this tweet from the Revenant Post?
[01:29:45.721 --> 01:29:49.623]  A racist, sexist demagogue just won the New Hampshire primary.
[01:29:49.643 --> 01:29:50.044]  Look at that.
[01:29:50.104 --> 01:29:50.724]  Bernie Sanders?
[01:29:50.944 --> 01:29:51.465]  Yeah, what?
[01:29:53.307 --> 01:29:54.348]  That's what they're calling Trump.
[01:29:54.409 --> 01:29:55.530]  They would never call Bernie that.
[01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:58.735]  They would say, our dear old grandpa, he won.
[01:29:59.096 --> 01:30:00.358]  He's one of us.
[01:30:04.571 --> 01:30:11.296]  People are very one-sided in their labeling of racism and sexism.
[01:30:11.356 --> 01:30:18.041]  Hillary Clinton, when people said she was part of the establishment, she goes, I'm a woman, I can't be part of the establishment.
[01:30:18.722 --> 01:30:21.964]  If you're black, you can't be racist, they will tell us.
[01:30:22.024 --> 01:30:23.866]  And yet, we know that that's true.
[01:30:23.946 --> 01:30:30.090]  You can be white and racist, you can be black and racist, but that's not part of the liberal gospel.
[01:30:32.613 --> 01:30:36.844]  A way that they describe that, of course, that's just not within their, they can't conceive of that.
[01:30:37.776 --> 01:30:48.602]  Well, I feel it's going to be very interesting to me to see how they do attack Sanders if he does end up becoming their Democratic candidate.
[01:30:49.682 --> 01:30:58.147]  You know, are they going to now point out what a bad idea socialism is after they have been indoctrinating socialism in the youth for so long?
[01:30:58.367 --> 01:30:59.988]  Will they try to fight against that now?
[01:31:00.088 --> 01:31:02.850]  Or is that in order to pull them back Hillary's way?
[01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:05.811]  I think they're just going to go to the electability issue.
[01:31:05.831 --> 01:31:07.852]  They're just going to say that he's not electable.
[01:31:07.913 --> 01:31:11.735]  But you do have the hardcore, true believers of the Democrat Party.
[01:31:12.115 --> 01:31:14.016]  That's why they love Bernie Sanders so much.
[01:31:14.076 --> 01:31:17.218]  It's just like Ron Paul when he was running within the Republican Party.
[01:31:17.798 --> 01:31:21.620]  People who were the Libertarian wing, it was like, yes, he's one of our own.
[01:31:22.661 --> 01:31:26.703]  And I see that same kind of phenomenon happening with Bernie Sanders because
[01:31:28.384 --> 01:31:40.248]  There's a huge part of the Democrat Party, as we just talked about with these exit polls, most of them believe that Bernie Sanders was not too liberal, he was just about right, but that Hillary Clinton was too conservative when looking at ideology.
[01:31:40.728 --> 01:31:45.550]  And then they're looking at the character issue, they're overwhelmingly going at that character issue.
[01:31:46.110 --> 01:31:50.874]  And the issues, it breaks down character issues, people who think that's important.
[01:31:50.894 --> 01:31:56.539]  59% of them said that they thought that was important and you're seeing 59% of the people voting for Bernie Sanders.
[01:31:57.119 --> 01:32:00.382]  40% thought that electability issues and experience were the important things.
[01:32:01.043 --> 01:32:02.764]  That's what you see Hillary Clinton coming up.
[01:32:02.804 --> 01:32:03.945]  So that's the way it's going to break down.
[01:32:03.965 --> 01:32:08.529]  It's going to break down with character and integrity versus electability and experience.
[01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:15.913]  Well, it's very interesting to see how we have been sort of being prepared for what is happening in the country.
[01:32:16.573 --> 01:32:21.895]  Of course, Barack Obama was elected on his social issues, his character, his likability.
[01:32:22.235 --> 01:32:23.636]  He was a community organizer.
[01:32:23.696 --> 01:32:25.296]  That was his big claim to fame.
[01:32:25.716 --> 01:32:33.219]  And then now the next one we've got rolling in is a socialist Democrat, Bernie Sanders, who's basically running on the same thing.
[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:36.581]  He's experiencing that same surge.
[01:32:37.462 --> 01:32:38.767]  As Barack Obama did.
[01:32:38.787 --> 01:32:39.650]  So, interesting.
[01:32:39.851 --> 01:32:41.377]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:41.537 --> 01:32:42.842]  Let's go to Dare McBrain.
[01:32:44.707 --> 01:32:46.708]  Yeah, guys, we were just talking behind the scenes.
[01:32:46.748 --> 01:32:48.189]  In fact, Kit Daniels just showed up.
[01:32:48.469 --> 01:32:50.251]  You should come back here because he wrote this article.
[01:32:50.791 --> 01:32:57.295]  We're just talking about what a disaster the Jeb Bush campaign has been from the very, very beginning.
[01:32:57.955 --> 01:33:00.677]  And I think everybody's sick of the Bush dynasty.
[01:33:00.917 --> 01:33:01.478]  That's true.
[01:33:01.518 --> 01:33:03.959]  And they want an anti-establishment candidate.
[01:33:03.999 --> 01:33:05.100]  They want to just move on.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:13.065]  But it's no wonder he's not doing well when he hits the campaign trail telling people that he will not blame Obama for anything.
[01:33:14.626 --> 01:33:16.366]  That's a bad campaign advice right there.
[01:33:16.746 --> 01:33:24.509]  That's like saying, if I become president, I will pardon Obama for any crimes, just like Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon.
[01:33:24.529 --> 01:33:28.371]  Well, because he knows it's not really his brother Obama, they're just the puppet.
[01:33:29.391 --> 01:33:30.252]  What is wrong with that?
[01:33:30.292 --> 01:33:33.353]  That is a horrible campaign strategy to go around saying that.
[01:33:33.533 --> 01:33:36.297]  He's just a spineless fence-sitter, okay?
[01:33:36.317 --> 01:33:37.198]  That's what he is.
[01:33:37.478 --> 01:33:43.847]  He can't criticize his brother's war in Iraq, even though everybody knows that that was a crock right now.
[01:33:44.388 --> 01:33:48.513]  He thinks he can get excitement in his campaign by putting an exclamation point after his name.
[01:33:48.533 --> 01:33:48.894]  You know what?
[01:33:49.535 --> 01:33:50.356]  You really can't...
[01:33:51.823 --> 01:33:53.124]  You really aren't going to get there with that.
[01:33:53.344 --> 01:33:56.105]  And you know, look at the different things that he's done in his campaign.
[01:33:56.145 --> 01:34:02.087]  When he was going head-to-head with Rubio, and that's really what was happening in New Hampshire.
[01:34:02.427 --> 01:34:05.889]  He believed that he and Rubio were going to be fighting it out for second place.
[01:34:06.089 --> 01:34:08.770]  I don't think he gave as much credit to Kasich there.
[01:34:09.230 --> 01:34:11.711]  And so he was running a lot of ads attacking Rubio.
[01:34:11.791 --> 01:34:13.231]  What did he attack Rubio on?
[01:34:13.611 --> 01:34:19.232]  He attacked Rubio by saying, look, he's wearing boots that have a little bit too high of a heel on it.
[01:34:19.412 --> 01:34:23.073]  I mean, so incredibly petty and playing this music soundtrack.
[01:34:23.113 --> 01:34:25.933]  These boots are made for walking and it was tacky.
[01:34:26.073 --> 01:34:28.074]  It was cheap.
[01:34:28.114 --> 01:34:31.254]  He learned from his dad, you know, and he learned from his brother.
[01:34:31.294 --> 01:34:33.955]  They ran the same type of campaigns back in the day.
[01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:35.615]  I just don't think it works anymore.
[01:34:35.895 --> 01:34:38.076]  I think the people are done with the Bush dynasty.
[01:34:38.116 --> 01:34:38.756]  They want to move on.
[01:34:39.016 --> 01:34:39.417]  Exactly.
[01:34:39.497 --> 01:34:48.847]  He spends $120 million running ads like that attacking Rubio, and then comes back and says, well, I don't have a height issue.
[01:34:48.928 --> 01:34:50.609]  No, Jeff doesn't have a height issue.
[01:34:50.850 --> 01:34:52.512]  He has a stature issue.
[01:34:52.792 --> 01:34:54.234]  A lack of stature, okay?
[01:34:54.414 --> 01:34:57.698]  He may be 6'3", but he has absolutely no stature.
[01:34:58.018 --> 01:35:12.906]  Let's play that clip where he's talking about himself being Vito Corleone, because I thought that was a great example of how Bush, even when he wants to brag about himself or when he wants to attack somebody else, he never can quite get it right.
[01:35:13.006 --> 01:35:14.287]  He's just not there.
[01:35:14.307 --> 01:35:15.387]  Do you guys have that clip ready?
[01:35:16.348 --> 01:35:17.068]  Vito Corleone.
[01:35:17.108 --> 01:35:18.209]  Yeah, Vito Corleone.
[01:35:18.769 --> 01:35:23.812]  They call me Vito Corleone, because I veto 2,500 separate line items in the budget.
[01:35:24.739 --> 01:35:26.660]  Okay, they call me Vito Corleone.
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:38.883]  Now, if you remember the Godfather, okay, they've got this cracker senator out in Nevada and he introduces Vito Corleone as Mr. Vito Corleone.
[01:35:39.523 --> 01:35:39.883]  Remember?
[01:35:40.063 --> 01:35:42.704]  Because I vetoed 2,500 separate line items in the budget.
[01:35:43.223 --> 01:35:45.885]  Right, so he goes out, he says, I'm going to be Vito Corleone.
[01:35:46.245 --> 01:35:48.947]  And so he pronounced it Corleone, like the Senator.
[01:35:49.027 --> 01:35:50.528]  I mean, he can't get anything right.
[01:35:51.008 --> 01:36:06.559]  And you know, we look at this and the standing joke in our house with Travis and others is like, you know, Fredo, when he goes home to the Bush crime family head, I'm sure the Bush crime family head looks at him and says to Jeb, Fredo, Fredo, you broke my heart.
[01:36:07.995 --> 01:36:09.576]  You just don't have it, man.
[01:36:09.716 --> 01:36:11.217]  I know, he's just so sad.
[01:36:11.257 --> 01:36:12.718]  He makes me just really sad.
[01:36:12.738 --> 01:36:15.119]  He had to pay people to be excited.
[01:36:15.139 --> 01:36:18.101]  You know, I'll pay you extra if you're excited in the chairs.
[01:36:18.181 --> 01:36:18.421]  Please clap.
[01:36:18.441 --> 01:36:19.202]  Yeah, the please clap.
[01:36:19.242 --> 01:36:19.802]  The please clap.
[01:36:19.822 --> 01:36:20.663]  Yeah, pull that thing up.
[01:36:20.703 --> 01:36:21.543]  We'll play that again.
[01:36:21.623 --> 01:36:22.784]  That was the most pathetic thing.
[01:36:23.004 --> 01:36:26.366]  And when you look at that in context, what is he saying?
[01:36:26.806 --> 01:36:30.148]  He says, we need a strong, quiet leader.
[01:36:30.469 --> 01:36:34.451]  We don't need somebody who's going to be blustering around, all this kind of stuff.
[01:36:34.491 --> 01:36:35.832]  Yeah, let's play that clip.
[01:36:37.213 --> 01:36:39.294]  Talking a big game without backing it up.
[01:36:39.394 --> 01:36:49.539]  I think the next president needs to be a lot quieter, but send a signal that we're prepared to act in the national security interests of this country to get back in the business of creating a more peaceful world.
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:51.520]  Please clap.
[01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:55.602]  He needs cue cards.
[01:36:55.843 --> 01:36:57.883]  They're going to start putting cue cards for the audience.
[01:36:58.063 --> 01:36:59.124]  Applause now.
[01:36:59.284 --> 01:37:01.004]  But we look at that in the context of things.
[01:37:01.124 --> 01:37:05.306]  I think the next leader needs to be really strong but project quiet power.
[01:37:05.906 --> 01:37:09.087]  It's like a campaign that's being run out of Comedy Central.
[01:37:09.548 --> 01:37:09.948]  Yeah.
[01:37:10.208 --> 01:37:10.688]  Exactly.
[01:37:10.788 --> 01:37:11.528]  He's such an idiot.
[01:37:11.588 --> 01:37:12.109]  It's pathetic.
[01:37:12.409 --> 01:37:13.049]  He's such an idiot.
[01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:15.130]  And then he goes and he attacks Trump.
[01:37:15.630 --> 01:37:17.671]  And remember in the debate, right?
[01:37:17.771 --> 01:37:18.291]  Friday night
[01:37:19.258 --> 01:37:25.043]  They're saying, uh, well, you know, he's been advised, some advisors say, yeah, we told him, you got to throw that punch.
[01:37:25.183 --> 01:37:27.225]  You know, you're the guy who can really do this.
[01:37:27.265 --> 01:37:29.687]  You've got that right hook, but you got to throw the punch.
[01:37:29.727 --> 01:37:31.109]  Well, here's the punch that I gave him.
[01:37:31.129 --> 01:37:33.230]  They said attack Trump on eminent domain.
[01:37:33.871 --> 01:37:36.453]  Good, good idea because he's very vulnerable on that.
[01:37:36.513 --> 01:37:37.855]  He's wrong on that issue.
[01:37:37.915 --> 01:37:40.217]  If you don't allow people to have
[01:37:40.717 --> 01:37:50.101]  Private property, the same property rights for people whether you are a small businessman or whether you are a large businessman, you should get the same property rights.
[01:37:50.121 --> 01:37:52.182]  You shouldn't have your property stolen, okay?
[01:37:52.722 --> 01:37:55.803]  And not taken for private use under any circumstances.
[01:37:55.863 --> 01:37:57.744]  But Trump is on the wrong side of that issue.
[01:37:57.784 --> 01:38:05.767]  So what he does is he throws that at him and then Trump comes back with a Keystone Pipeline and Jeb doesn't even know that the Keystone Pipeline is private.
[01:38:06.008 --> 01:38:06.508]  Furthermore,
[01:38:07.168 --> 01:38:17.499]  The next day, Trump comes out and goes, oh, and by the way, the Bush family took private property for their baseball stadium, their baseball team in Texas, okay?
[01:38:17.519 --> 01:38:24.907]  So he's a hypocrite on that issue, just like on, just as he is on Planned Parenthood issues as well.
[01:38:25.147 --> 01:38:25.387]  Right.
[01:38:25.628 --> 01:38:28.551]  Well, let's go to Jakari Jackson now in the Situation Room.
[01:38:29.121 --> 01:38:33.003]  That was a very interesting conversation you guys are having there, talking about Bush.
[01:38:33.023 --> 01:38:34.004]  I agree with you, David.
[01:38:34.124 --> 01:38:37.666]  He may be 6'3", but he really has no presence at all.
[01:38:37.706 --> 01:38:43.169]  At least his brother was, you know, somewhat entertaining in a kind of scrupulous, crumb sort of way.
[01:38:43.609 --> 01:38:45.110]  Well, he had his other issues, too.
[01:38:45.130 --> 01:38:47.311]  You know, he had his Bush-isms, the way he would phrase stuff.
[01:38:47.371 --> 01:38:47.691]  Oh, yeah.
[01:38:47.771 --> 01:38:55.516]  I mean, also, you know, W, he still had Cheney standing behind him, you know, so he had enough presence, so he could be pretty much the mouthpiece.
[01:38:55.976 --> 01:39:01.019]  Well, you know, we're talking about the guys who haven't so much made it when we talk about Bush and all these other guys.
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.262]  There's another guy I want to talk about who's threatening to throw his hat into the ring.
[01:39:05.582 --> 01:39:07.283]  That is Mayor Mikey Bloomberg.
[01:39:07.884 --> 01:39:10.746]  And he's on deck, you know, threatening to get in.
[01:39:11.366 --> 01:39:22.180]  If they are able to take down Hillary, whether it be email scandals or if Bernie just completely knocks her out of the box, he said he's pretty much waiting in the wings and ready to go if he deems it necessary.
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:25.945]  I think he's gonna make his final decision coming up real soon in March.
[01:39:26.886 --> 01:39:33.409]  But, you know, I want to ask you guys, when we see a guy like Michael Bloomberg, who has armed bodyguards, but he doesn't want anybody else to be armed.
[01:39:33.749 --> 01:39:40.392]  He wants to ban sodas and cigarettes and tell you how much salt you can put on your, you know, on your whatever food.
[01:39:41.593 --> 01:39:43.394]  It's a real ridiculous kind of situation.
[01:39:43.434 --> 01:39:47.996]  And I just really wonder if anybody would take this guy serious as a presidential candidate.
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:40:01.563]  Well, it's going to be kind of interesting because if there was a race without Hillary, if you had Sanders and Trump, for example, and Michael Bloomberg says that would be the condition under which you would come in, I really don't see him taking votes away from Donald Trump.
[01:40:01.623 --> 01:40:06.704]  I see him taking votes away from Bernie Sanders, the more liberal wing of that group.
[01:40:06.784 --> 01:40:15.926]  And you know, the interesting thing is just today we had him attacking the liberal governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, who's been a
[01:40:16.246 --> 01:40:16.506]  Clinton
[01:40:34.565 --> 01:40:34.865]  Not enough.
[01:40:34.905 --> 01:40:44.551]  They actually put out an ad about him in a newspaper here recently, and they said, Michael Bloomberg's group, the Everytown Group, said basically, you know, he's not anti-gun enough.
[01:40:44.592 --> 01:40:47.373]  He doesn't want to get rid of these gun show loopholes.
[01:40:47.393 --> 01:40:54.958]  And if you guys haven't seen that episode of Louder with Crowded, it's on the internet, where he goes to all these gun shows and he pretty much debunks this gun show loophole.
[01:40:55.799 --> 01:40:58.020]  I go to gun shows regularly, Joe Biggs does.
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:00.442]  I know, David, your boys are into firearms as well.
[01:41:00.822 --> 01:41:09.509]  Every time I've been to a gun show, the FFL dealers, the real dealers, will check your ID religiously because they know feds come in there trying to bust them.
[01:41:09.789 --> 01:41:10.209]  That's right.
[01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:18.516]  So, with that in mind, anybody who thinks that, you know, God is just, you know, handing out, you know, shotguns like they're candy, you can watch this video and see that is not the case.
[01:41:18.556 --> 01:41:20.777]  Now, of course, you do have the ability to private sale.
[01:41:20.797 --> 01:41:22.338]  Like, David, I could sell you a firearm right now.
[01:41:22.358 --> 01:41:23.179]  That's not an issue.
[01:41:23.239 --> 01:41:26.502]  But for your FFL dealers, you do have that in place.
[01:41:27.042 --> 01:41:30.103]  They're just as careful as if you're buying at a gun store.
[01:41:30.863 --> 01:41:33.904]  But Jakari, as you're pointing out, it's the private sale that they want to shut down.
[01:41:33.964 --> 01:41:34.864]  It's not the gun show.
[01:41:34.884 --> 01:41:36.365]  They want to shut down private sales.
[01:41:36.405 --> 01:41:39.305]  They don't want to say we want to shut down private sales.
[01:41:39.325 --> 01:41:45.467]  They want to say we want to shut down gun shows because they don't want you to be able to keep the guns in the family.
[01:41:45.507 --> 01:41:47.968]  They don't want you to be able to pass them down, things like that.
[01:41:48.528 --> 01:41:49.989]  That's what they're really coming after.
[01:41:50.009 --> 01:41:51.109]  It's just another way
[01:41:52.259 --> 01:41:55.441]  Death by a thousand cuts of the Second Amendment.
[01:41:55.481 --> 01:41:58.243]  That's why the Second Amendment said, shall not be infringed.
[01:41:58.403 --> 01:42:04.927]  They knew that nobody's going to come in and say, and one day that, oh by the way, we're confiscating all the guns tomorrow.
[01:42:04.947 --> 01:42:05.987]  They're never going to do that.
[01:42:06.047 --> 01:42:07.908]  They're going to take it down bit by bit.
[01:42:07.969 --> 01:42:08.809]  Incrementalism.
[01:42:08.929 --> 01:42:10.270]  Incrementalism, exactly.
[01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:11.811]  They're going to take away our ammunition.
[01:42:11.851 --> 01:42:15.473]  They're going to take, that's going to be a key thing, putting controls on ammunition.
[01:42:15.773 --> 01:42:18.515]  Magazine limits, magazine limits, all that kind of stuff.
[01:42:18.775 --> 01:42:19.555]  That's another thing.
[01:42:19.575 --> 01:42:26.997]  I've seen so many people, they throw out these ad homonyms, these buzzwords, when they talk about high-capacity magazine.
[01:42:27.257 --> 01:42:31.378]  If you buy an AK-47 with a 30-round magazine, that's a standard capacity magazine.
[01:42:31.418 --> 01:42:32.198]  That's what comes with it.
[01:42:32.519 --> 01:42:34.939]  They throw out all these buzz terms to confuse people.
[01:42:35.259 --> 01:42:36.300]  You know, assault rifle.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:37.820]  If you go to a big box store,
[01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:47.245]  You go to Academy, you go to Cabela's or whatever it may be in your part of the country, and you see those rifles on the shelf, even though they look like what you see in the movie, those are not fully automatic rifles.
[01:42:47.265 --> 01:42:49.786]  And they say, well, you can convert those to fully automatic rifles.
[01:42:49.806 --> 01:42:52.648]  Well, you can push the gas in your car and run over people in Las Vegas.
[01:42:53.008 --> 01:42:54.549]  You can do anything to hurt people.
[01:42:54.949 --> 01:42:58.011]  It's just the person in the ill intent to do so.
[01:42:58.311 --> 01:43:01.314]  Hmm, Jakari, you sound like an extremist with those views.
[01:43:01.635 --> 01:43:08.562]  But it's interesting that either way, the Democrats, they're wanting someone who's going to control every single aspect of their life.
[01:43:08.922 --> 01:43:11.685]  So, I mean, nothing is free, like Bernie Sanders.
[01:43:12.146 --> 01:43:14.128]  The government's going to be controlling everything.
[01:43:14.228 --> 01:43:15.589]  I can't hand out those freebies.
[01:43:15.809 --> 01:43:19.573]  But then you've got someone like Bloomberg, who doesn't even let you put salt on the table.
[01:43:20.674 --> 01:43:31.820]  Yeah, and you guys touched on it earlier when, I believe it was David, you made the point that one of the reasons they're pushing so hard to keep you in school with this free college is so they can continue the indoctrination and I do agree with that.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:34.801]  They can continue to just feed you this system, this
[01:43:35.962 --> 01:43:38.784]  Nanny said, we make all the decisions that's best for you.
[01:43:38.904 --> 01:43:43.888]  And you see so many people now, we've done so many men on the streets where people say, well, the government's just going to take care of me.
[01:43:44.188 --> 01:43:45.529]  They're going to, you know, just tell me what to do.
[01:43:45.870 --> 01:43:51.174]  It's a very stark contrast from, you know, decades ago, you know, Nixon, whoever, you know, they'd be up to some shady deals.
[01:43:51.214 --> 01:43:53.856]  People go to the White House and shake the bars and they say, Oh no, no.
[01:43:53.896 --> 01:43:54.116]  Okay.
[01:43:54.156 --> 01:43:54.837]  I'm sorry.
[01:43:54.877 --> 01:43:55.297]  We did that.
[01:43:55.597 --> 01:43:56.678]  People don't do that anymore.
[01:43:56.698 --> 01:44:02.803]  When the government just continues to control that vice or squeeze that vice out of them, they just say, well, that's the way it's supposed to be.
[01:44:03.211 --> 01:44:20.711]  Right, I mean that's what people have come to know, and with this indoctrination you do absolutely learn about obedience, not speaking out, which is why it's interesting to see such a movement there with the young people, but they don't even realize that a lot of what they're pushing is the messages that they've been indoctrinated with.
[01:44:20.851 --> 01:44:28.957]  Well, it's such a faux debate, you know, because they'll teach them to go out there and throw dildos at each other and argue about the stuff that doesn't matter.
[01:44:29.217 --> 01:44:33.861]  But when it comes to real issues that are going to affect them in their day-to-day lives, they could care less.
[01:44:34.335 --> 01:44:35.276]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:44:35.336 --> 01:44:36.096]  Well, it's interesting.
[01:44:36.577 --> 01:44:41.221]  Talking about schooling, we can get back to that with Cruz and where he stands on that.
[01:44:41.261 --> 01:44:42.001]  Thank you, Jakari.
[01:44:42.702 --> 01:44:50.168]  And also, we're seeing on a Drudge Report that Biden has also said he hasn't weighed out, you know, not joining the race as well.
[01:44:50.568 --> 01:44:52.730]  Well, let's go ahead and get back to Richard Reeves.
[01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:54.091]  He is there in New Hampshire.
[01:44:54.131 --> 01:44:55.212]  Richard, what's the update?
[01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:57.120]  All right, Leanne.
[01:44:57.321 --> 01:45:02.003]  Well, as you just saw, Bernie is, uh, I guess doing his Ted Cruz impression by doing a long speech.
[01:45:02.523 --> 01:45:06.085]  But, uh, I'll tell you, Bernie, Bernie really has worked it hard.
[01:45:06.825 --> 01:45:11.868]  And probably out of all the candidates, his volunteers really are the most fervent.
[01:45:12.268 --> 01:45:22.173]  They really are the ones that are probably, you know, they're making probably the most phone calls, knocking on the most doors, which that's a concern because they're just trying to spread that socialist virus.
[01:45:22.834 --> 01:45:25.035]  Uh, you know, hey, government just feed us, clothe us.
[01:45:25.748 --> 01:45:27.189]  You know, from womb to tomb.
[01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:30.690]  But that is the essence of the Democrat Party.
[01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:32.350]  That is the essence of the Democrat Party.
[01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:38.733]  I mean, Ron Paul tapped into the essence of the Republican Party, saying we want to be left alone.
[01:45:38.773 --> 01:45:39.533]  We want freedom.
[01:45:40.073 --> 01:45:41.414]  These people want free stuff.
[01:45:41.894 --> 01:45:43.915]  Okay, that's the essence of the Democrat message.
[01:45:45.069 --> 01:45:51.493]  Well, and you know, we know it's a New World Order project to send kids to public school and train them to be good little socialists.
[01:45:51.773 --> 01:45:52.033]  That's right.
[01:45:52.093 --> 01:45:55.035]  And I'll tell you what, unfortunately, they're having huge success.
[01:45:55.515 --> 01:45:57.236]  And like I say, it's going viral.
[01:45:57.756 --> 01:46:02.659]  But I guess, you know, silver lining in the cloud is potentially Bernie takes down Hillary.
[01:46:02.739 --> 01:46:06.241]  So, you know, it's kind of like one of those
[01:46:06.881 --> 01:46:11.763]  Old jokes, you know, the bittersweet deal, right?
[01:46:11.863 --> 01:46:23.487]  It's interesting, because really the only difference between a Democrat or a Democratic Socialist would be that one just gives you the idea that you're allowing to vote, whereas the other one is just passing it all with authoritarianism.
[01:46:23.747 --> 01:46:25.828]  We will provide you this.
[01:46:26.388 --> 01:46:28.049]  We will take our meager rations.
[01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:30.290]  Right.
[01:46:30.650 --> 01:46:33.671]  Well now, kind of on a different subject, shifting gears,
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:41.467]  One thing we learned that's interesting about New Hampshire is that today's voting was only about the presidential race.
[01:46:41.607 --> 01:46:43.650]  Today's voting was only about the presidential race.
[01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:47.934]  They had no down-ballot issues, no down-ballot candidates.
[01:46:48.515 --> 01:46:56.543]  And we talked to the Deputy Secretary of State, and he said those down-ballot votes occur way in September.
[01:46:57.350 --> 01:47:24.374]  It's happening in September, so it's very interesting, because one of the things that we're really needing to look for, Leanne and David, one thing that's going to be really important to look for, and I'll be looking for it, as soon as we have a state that has a full ballot where you've got everything from dog catcher issues to local resolutions to, you know, small district and county races, city races, state races, and different races like that.
[01:47:24.861 --> 01:47:31.725]  What we're going to really need to look at is to see how many of those incumbents are getting fired in those primaries.
[01:47:31.765 --> 01:47:37.428]  That's what's going to be key because we really need to see some big turnover of incumbents.
[01:47:37.868 --> 01:47:40.710]  Unfortunately, New Hampshire is not going to give us a good litmus test on that.
[01:47:42.711 --> 01:47:46.474]  Well, any idea on when Trump is going to be taking the stage here?
[01:47:46.554 --> 01:47:49.657]  I guess Bernie Sanders is done?
[01:47:50.277 --> 01:47:51.798]  I think that's the case.
[01:47:51.858 --> 01:47:53.319]  I think that's exactly the case.
[01:47:53.860 --> 01:48:01.046]  They are sitting here playing the Bernie Sanders video live on Fox and I think they got a CNN TV going on somewhere.
[01:48:01.546 --> 01:48:03.608]  So literally, and what was interesting too,
[01:48:04.571 --> 01:48:05.993]  Wait a minute, let me jump in.
[01:48:06.013 --> 01:48:10.238]  Bernie's just telling everybody how he's going to spend their money better than they can.
[01:48:10.458 --> 01:48:12.741]  So that's taking a while for him to do that.
[01:48:12.781 --> 01:48:13.882]  That's why it's taking so long.
[01:48:13.943 --> 01:48:16.566]  Yeah, because there's so many ways he's going to spend your money.
[01:48:17.367 --> 01:48:21.011]  Well, you know, they all think that he's going to be spending other people's money on them.
[01:48:21.332 --> 01:48:23.975]  They don't think they're going to be paying anything.
[01:48:24.275 --> 01:48:31.858]  They think they're going to be living off of their neighbor, and as Margaret Thatcher said, eventually with socialism you run out of other people's money.
[01:48:31.898 --> 01:48:33.639]  But that's the promise of socialism.
[01:48:33.899 --> 01:48:35.999]  You're going to live large on other people's money.
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:37.600]  Because they don't deserve it, you do.
[01:48:39.521 --> 01:48:40.001]  That's right.
[01:48:40.041 --> 01:48:42.742]  And Rob, just send Bernie your wallet.
[01:48:42.802 --> 01:48:44.183]  You'll be feeling the burn that way.
[01:48:44.203 --> 01:48:46.463]  Yeah, we're going to be feeling the heartburn.
[01:48:49.517 --> 01:48:56.600]  The good news is, though, is that Trump is going to have this victory here in New Hampshire, and it did not involve any coin flips.
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.501]  So that's a very big positive right there.
[01:48:59.541 --> 01:49:00.661]  No coin flips involved.
[01:49:01.181 --> 01:49:02.422]  Trump's going to win the night.
[01:49:02.502 --> 01:49:04.783]  There's no coin-duggery involved.
[01:49:04.843 --> 01:49:09.524]  Yeah, and did he go into New Hampshire with some delegates already delegated to him?
[01:49:09.544 --> 01:49:10.024]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:49:12.338 --> 01:49:16.949]  One thing we'd like to do is kind of pan the audience so you can get an idea of the group we've got in here.
[01:49:17.009 --> 01:49:18.412]  So Matt, if you want to raise that up.
[01:49:18.993 --> 01:49:21.259]  If you want to raise it up and we'll show you the crowd.
[01:49:22.071 --> 01:49:23.352]  Another capacity crowd.
[01:49:23.732 --> 01:49:32.475]  I tell you what, I think it's possible that with Donald Trump's events, a lot of times people cannot get in.
[01:49:32.935 --> 01:49:36.357]  A lot of times people get turned away from Donald Trump events.
[01:49:36.677 --> 01:49:41.238]  So that literally may be something that actually costs him some votes, especially in Iowa.
[01:49:41.258 --> 01:49:42.299]  You had people lining up.
[01:49:42.959 --> 01:49:51.944]  In 20 degree weather out there lining up for hours and a lot of times turned away from going in even though the venues were big.
[01:49:52.759 --> 01:50:02.144]  It was still a case where they're turned away, so I got a feeling that that probably cost him some votes because in Iowa and New Hampshire, it's all about shaking hands and meeting the people.
[01:50:02.244 --> 01:50:04.005]  Yeah, he campaigned very differently.
[01:50:04.045 --> 01:50:08.287]  He did not go business to business shaking hands individually.
[01:50:08.327 --> 01:50:13.310]  He had the massive events and that was very uncharacteristic of New Hampshire.
[01:50:13.610 --> 01:50:21.276]  Right, and that's what a lot of people were wondering, is would these massive crowds that he's been able to pull in also equate to votes?
[01:50:21.676 --> 01:50:23.057]  So, looks like it did here.
[01:50:23.077 --> 01:50:31.164]  Well, that's been his strength, and his strength has been that he's going to redefine it to do it the way that he wants to do it, and that's basically worked for him so far, quite frankly.
[01:50:31.184 --> 01:50:36.428]  I think that he didn't really have a problem in Iowa, I think it was simply
[01:50:37.088 --> 01:50:38.389]  Playing the expectation game.
[01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:45.433]  We see that Ted Cruz, I don't know if you heard this, Richard, but we're talking about Ted Cruz is telling everybody, hey, it's neck and neck.
[01:50:45.493 --> 01:50:51.217]  It looks like Marco Rubio could come in first place with an edge out Donald Trump.
[01:50:51.237 --> 01:50:56.360]  He's trying to play up the expectation game for Rubio by saying he had a chance of coming in first place.
[01:50:56.401 --> 01:51:02.024]  Rubio never was even, nobody was even within striking distance of Donald Trump in New Hampshire.
[01:51:02.044 --> 01:51:04.085]  So it's that kind of fundamental
[01:51:05.026 --> 01:51:10.237]  Dishonest gamesmanship that we see Cruz resorting to in every one of these contests.
[01:51:10.718 --> 01:51:13.944]  And he was doing it in New Hampshire with Rubio as well.
[01:51:15.359 --> 01:51:20.883]  Well, I think for sure the New World Order, the powers that be are not done with Rubio yet.
[01:51:20.923 --> 01:51:24.966]  Look for Rubio to still be pushed in upcoming races.
[01:51:25.487 --> 01:51:27.168]  I think we figured out the strategy here.
[01:51:27.268 --> 01:51:32.492]  The strategy was the powers that be pushed the governors to get them over the 10% threshold.
[01:51:32.932 --> 01:51:34.434]  They wanted to make this
[01:51:35.054 --> 01:51:42.907]  Five or six people, five or six candidate horse race and it looks like they're probably going to succeed with that because of the delegates.
[01:51:43.207 --> 01:51:49.137]  Now one thing on a different topic as well during these speeches that we've been having here in the Trump
[01:51:50.069 --> 01:52:13.431]  Trump location is when Hillary came out this audience this audience was booing and just chanting liar liar liar liar and they're actually kind of you know kind of sitting here kind of why they're loud but they're they're not doing Bernie like that they're treating Bernie kind of kindly and nicely I think they're they're just happy to see him taking Hillary on and
[01:52:14.426 --> 01:52:16.047]  Making her like the Wicked Witch of the West.
[01:52:16.268 --> 01:52:20.491]  She's starting to melt pretty bad in this campaign right now.
[01:52:20.591 --> 01:52:24.054]  Well you know Richard, even in the Democrat Party they yell liar liar at Hillary Clinton.
[01:52:24.314 --> 01:52:25.535]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:52:25.615 --> 01:52:42.348]  We were just showing some B-roll of the guy that's been trolling Marco Rubio, following him around, dressed in a robot costume, and this particular guy, his name is Black, it's Aaron Black, wearing a silver robot costume.
[01:52:42.368 --> 01:52:42.649]  He says,
[01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:44.931]  I don't know what's the matter with these Rubio people.
[01:52:44.951 --> 01:52:46.912]  He goes, they have a major malfunction.
[01:52:46.952 --> 01:52:48.854]  I must have seriously pressed their buttons.
[01:52:49.394 --> 01:52:51.036]  Talking about them being robots as well.
[01:52:51.316 --> 01:52:57.241]  And when you start beating a guy who's trolling your campaign... With your campaign sign.
[01:52:57.301 --> 01:53:02.405]  With your candidate's campaign sign, you've got some serious problems, let me tell you.
[01:53:05.112 --> 01:53:10.616]  Well, you know, and it really hasn't even come out yet about Marco Rubio's support for the TPP.
[01:53:11.216 --> 01:53:12.357]  We've got that video there.
[01:53:12.477 --> 01:53:22.424]  And I know Trump knows about it, though, because in subsequent speeches, you know, his mantra about attacking candidates is he doesn't attack anybody until they attack him.
[01:53:22.844 --> 01:53:25.466]  So Marco Rubio has been wise not to attack Trump.
[01:53:25.926 --> 01:53:29.871]  Because when he does, Trump will definitely call Rubio out about the TPP.
[01:53:30.532 --> 01:53:35.277]  And I think if there's anybody that can finish Marco Rubio off, it will be Trump.
[01:53:35.698 --> 01:53:38.040]  Well, Trump doesn't really have to waste any time on Marco Rubio.
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:41.965]  You've got Jeb Bush spending millions of dollars to make fun of him for wearing boots.
[01:53:43.486 --> 01:53:44.546]  And other things that he's doing.
[01:53:44.586 --> 01:53:49.268]  And then of course, you got Rubio essentially self-destructing in that debate.
[01:53:49.328 --> 01:53:50.548]  I mean, I've never seen anything like it.
[01:53:50.588 --> 01:53:55.830]  We've had situations where people are prepared with soundbites, they know what the other guy is going to say, and they sling it at him.
[01:53:56.090 --> 01:54:03.052]  But this was a situation where Marco Rubio did it to himself, kept repeating his soundbite in a robotic way.
[01:54:03.092 --> 01:54:06.693]  And I'm just unprecedented to see anything like that, but really hilarious.
[01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:09.061]  But David, David, here's the case.
[01:54:09.682 --> 01:54:13.385]  I look for the mainstream press to absolutely memory hole.
[01:54:13.926 --> 01:54:18.070]  They're going to memory hole what Marco Rubio did about the repetitive nature of his speeches.
[01:54:18.490 --> 01:54:19.431]  They're going to memory hole it.
[01:54:19.571 --> 01:54:20.992]  I think Marco's not done.
[01:54:21.373 --> 01:54:30.521]  He's still, I think, a fair-haired son of the powers that be, so... Well, I can tell you, we're going to keep repeating it, and we're going to keep repeating to people the fact that...
[01:54:31.482 --> 01:54:37.863]  We're going to keep repeating to people the fact that he says, let's get over the idea that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[01:54:37.963 --> 01:54:41.984]  He's got a well-defined plan to take this country down and make it like all the other countries.
[01:54:42.124 --> 01:54:51.406]  And then he says, in that clip that you put in your report, where he's talking to the CFR, we need to pass the TPA so we can get the TPP pushed through by Obama.
[01:54:52.407 --> 01:54:53.507]  Is he getting ready to come on stage?
[01:54:53.887 --> 01:54:55.027]  Donald's coming out.
[01:54:55.307 --> 01:54:56.668]  Donald's coming out now.
[01:54:56.728 --> 01:54:57.028]  Here we go.
[01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:01.782]  This is huge.
[01:55:02.906 --> 01:55:04.432]  He's got some huge news.
[01:55:06.067 --> 01:55:10.530]  Okay, he's at 34% right now.
[01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:18.275]  41% of the vote in, we've got Trump at 34%, Kasich at 16%, Cruz at 12%, Bush at 11%, Rubio at 11%, Christie at 8%.
[01:55:18.555 --> 01:55:19.696]  Look who he's talking over!
[01:55:19.736 --> 01:55:20.936]  He's talking over Jeb!
[01:55:21.877 --> 01:55:24.499]  Oh, he must have waited just for Jeb to come out.
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:26.680]  Oh, man.
[01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:32.324]  All the cameras on the mainstream media just cut from Jeb Trump.
[01:55:34.053 --> 01:55:34.493]  That's good.
[01:55:34.593 --> 01:55:36.014]  Yeah, Jeb is in fourth place.
[01:55:36.074 --> 01:55:36.474]  Poor Jeb.
[01:55:36.514 --> 01:55:37.695]  Talk about tiny cuts.
[01:55:38.496 --> 01:55:41.017]  He and Rubio are tied for fourth and fifth.
[01:55:41.637 --> 01:55:42.258]  Oh boy.
[01:55:42.278 --> 01:55:49.062]  See, you know how they say everyone loves an underdog, and I am such a sucker for the underdog.
[01:55:49.102 --> 01:55:51.163]  I feel so sorry for Jeb Bush.
[01:55:51.183 --> 01:55:51.743]  I don't.
[01:55:52.444 --> 01:55:52.564]  Aww.
[01:55:52.584 --> 01:55:53.884]  Poor Jeb.
[01:55:54.565 --> 01:55:56.046]  Oh, they took Jeb off.
[01:55:56.086 --> 01:55:56.986]  They took Jeb off.
[01:55:57.066 --> 01:55:57.587]  Jeb's gone.
[01:56:07.805 --> 01:56:08.746]  Check out the Ustream.
[01:56:08.766 --> 01:56:09.727]  Check out the Ustream.
[01:56:09.987 --> 01:56:10.407]  There we go.
[01:56:10.647 --> 01:56:11.388]  Got it on the Ustream.
[01:56:11.788 --> 01:56:13.229]  Yeah, you should have Ustream.
[01:56:15.130 --> 01:56:15.790]  This is it.
[01:56:15.810 --> 01:56:16.391]  We're on it.
[01:56:20.433 --> 01:56:21.234]  Yes, copy that.
[01:56:21.254 --> 01:56:21.774]  Zoom in.
[01:56:21.954 --> 01:56:22.254]  Copy.
[01:56:22.274 --> 01:56:28.098]  So I don't hear any audio.
[01:56:28.138 --> 01:56:28.598]  Is he talking?
[01:56:31.110 --> 01:56:32.271]  He said no, no audio.
[01:56:33.671 --> 01:56:34.171]  Okay.
[01:56:34.551 --> 01:56:36.272]  He said he's sending audio.
[01:56:38.193 --> 01:56:41.334]  I'll use my mic.
[01:56:44.695 --> 01:56:47.737]  And I want to thank my brother, my late brother, Fred.
[01:56:47.757 --> 01:56:49.117]  What a fantastic guy.
[01:56:49.257 --> 01:56:51.018]  I learned so much from Fred.
[01:56:51.527 --> 01:56:53.789]  He taught me more than just about anything.
[01:56:53.849 --> 01:56:55.950]  Just probably about even with my father.
[01:56:56.290 --> 01:56:57.631]  A fantastic guy.
[01:56:58.132 --> 01:56:59.312]  So I want to thank Fred.
[01:56:59.352 --> 01:57:00.854]  He's up there and he's looking down.
[01:57:06.017 --> 01:57:09.580]  And we can go right down the line, but we have to start with Melania.
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:11.561]  What she puts up with all.
[01:57:16.637 --> 01:57:21.622]  She said right from the beginning, you know if you run, you know you're going to win.
[01:57:22.142 --> 01:57:24.445]  And she said that from day one.
[01:57:24.565 --> 01:57:25.866]  So, Melania, thank you.
[01:57:26.166 --> 01:57:28.729]  Thank you.
[01:57:28.869 --> 01:57:32.112]  And Don and Vanessa, thank you so much.
[01:57:33.494 --> 01:57:34.715]  And Ivanka, she was out.
[01:57:34.735 --> 01:57:37.918]  She made seven stops today at the polling areas.
[01:57:43.334 --> 01:57:44.635]  Very, very special.
[01:57:44.776 --> 01:57:55.747]  And Jared, Jared is a very, very successful real estate entrepreneur in Manhattan, but he likes this better than real estate, I think.
[01:57:55.987 --> 01:57:59.992]  And Laura and Eric, and they were all out today, and it was amazing.
[01:58:01.599 --> 01:58:02.900]  And Corey, where is Corey?
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:04.880]  Does Corey have a ground game or a pod?
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:07.862]  Do we have a ground game?
[01:58:08.662 --> 01:58:09.642]  Where is Corey?
[01:58:09.683 --> 01:58:11.703]  Corey Lewandowski.
[01:58:11.743 --> 01:58:13.364]  How is he going to make America great again?
[01:58:13.384 --> 01:58:14.585]  Corey Lewandowski.
[01:58:15.005 --> 01:58:17.226]  I know you've got that video up.
[01:58:18.266 --> 01:58:18.866]  It's up on Patreon.
[01:58:21.636 --> 01:58:30.121]  Now one of the interesting things that came out earlier was we had Neil Cavuto ask Ben Carson if he would consider being Trump's VP.
[01:58:30.982 --> 01:58:34.184]  And Ben said he would certainly consider it.
[01:58:34.624 --> 01:58:39.307]  He said I would have to have major philosophical alignment with and have guarantees I could do some substantial things.
[01:58:39.827 --> 01:58:45.390]  But again, talking to him and asking him if he would be Trump's VP and he said he would consider it.
[01:58:45.491 --> 01:58:46.111]  Kind of interesting.
[01:58:46.502 --> 01:58:46.722]  Right.
[01:58:48.363 --> 01:58:54.905]  Well, that's what I've been secretly rooting for Rand Paul or to get that Supreme Court nomination.
[01:58:55.045 --> 01:58:57.846]  So I think that would be pretty neat.
[01:58:58.867 --> 01:59:00.707]  That would help make America great again.
[01:59:00.727 --> 01:59:03.368]  We actually get some good people there.
[01:59:04.429 --> 01:59:08.790]  Again, we have to thank the candidates because they really ran.
[01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:10.611]  We have some very talented people.
[01:59:11.417 --> 01:59:16.821]  And to be victorious against some of these people, even if it's for one week, but believe me, it's going to be for many weeks, okay?
[01:59:16.841 --> 01:59:21.104]  They really are, they're terrific.
[01:59:21.564 --> 01:59:27.388]  A number of them called, and I just wanted to thank them, but I wanted to congratulate the other candidates, okay?
[01:59:28.677 --> 01:59:30.058]  Not that I got that off with.
[01:59:31.099 --> 01:59:34.502]  You know, it's always tough and then tomorrow, boom, boom.
[01:59:35.202 --> 01:59:36.203]  But that's the way it is.
[01:59:36.263 --> 01:59:37.885]  And really, you have some real talent.
[01:59:37.925 --> 01:59:42.248]  Now, didn't he immediately call Jeb Bush a loser today when he was playing the Word Association?
[01:59:42.268 --> 01:59:44.971]  Yeah, yeah, but he pretty much got that right.
[01:59:45.131 --> 01:59:45.511]  Yeah.
[01:59:46.312 --> 01:59:52.217]  He hesitated a little bit in calling Hillary Clinton evil, but right away with Jeb.
[01:59:53.126 --> 01:59:54.887]  What do we really want to thank, right?
[01:59:55.147 --> 01:59:59.430]  We want to thank the people of New Hampshire, right?
[01:59:59.630 --> 02:00:02.291]  Do we love the people of New Hampshire?
[02:00:03.632 --> 02:00:06.654]  You know, I said it, and I said it even a year ago.
[02:00:06.674 --> 02:00:15.299]  I said, I think I'm going to do really well there because I'm here a lot, and it's so beautiful, and I love it so much, and I love the people.
[02:00:15.659 --> 02:00:18.261]  And I said, I actually think they like me a lot.
[02:00:18.881 --> 02:00:22.103]  And then all of a sudden, we started getting numbers in, and everyone said,
[02:00:22.583 --> 02:00:23.743]  How come they like Trump so much?
[02:00:23.763 --> 02:00:46.272]  Well it's interesting because, you know, Mark Cuban initially, he was the one that sort of famously got Trump the big stadium within about five days and he was able to fill out that stadium there and then Mark Cuban, the office of the billionaire entrepreneur, is talking about how he doesn't really appreciate any of the candidates this time around and he didn't name anyone specifically but
[02:00:46.992 --> 02:00:51.735]  Just trying to put out this rallying call for, listen, this is why millennials are so in love with Bernie Sanders.
[02:00:51.795 --> 02:00:56.998]  You guys need to get it together and stop running these ugly debates, but really come with some solutions.
[02:00:57.118 --> 02:01:03.202]  Yeah, you have an energized Democrat base because you got Bernie Sanders who runs to their core, which is
[02:01:04.062 --> 02:01:06.043]  Socialist liberalism, okay?
[02:01:06.283 --> 02:01:12.064]  There isn't anybody in the GOP field that really stands up for individual liberty and freedom.
[02:01:12.464 --> 02:01:13.465]  There's not anybody left.
[02:01:13.825 --> 02:01:14.705]  I mean, Rand Paul left.
[02:01:14.945 --> 02:01:16.846]  There's not anybody that really stands up for that.
[02:01:17.166 --> 02:01:18.646]  Now, what does Trump stand up for?
[02:01:18.686 --> 02:01:23.668]  I mean, is there anybody that, and we look at all these different issues, we look at eminent domain, they're all on the same page.
[02:01:23.688 --> 02:01:28.269]  We look at the NSA, spying, wars, they're all on the same page.
[02:01:28.849 --> 02:01:51.523]  The only difference that I see with any of these candidates, and I guess, you know, in a reluctant way, you could look at it and say, well, you know, Donald Trump has been on this issue of fighting the globalist takeover of our economy, and he's been doing that for 30 years, taking out a $100,000 page, you know, full page ad in the New York Times 30 years ago, talking about how we needed to change
[02:01:51.903 --> 02:01:57.145]  The bad trade deals, how we're being eviscerated economically by this so-called free trade.
[02:01:57.205 --> 02:01:58.645]  It's not free trade, it's managed trade.
[02:01:58.665 --> 02:02:06.128]  And if the TPP goes through, we're going to have our trade managed by a multinational commission.
[02:02:07.528 --> 02:02:09.849]  We don't have any say-so as to who is on that commission.
[02:02:10.369 --> 02:02:15.291]  And they are going to be able to change this 5,000-page managed trade.
[02:02:15.351 --> 02:02:15.971]  It's not free trade.
[02:02:15.991 --> 02:02:17.752]  They're going to be able to change that at will.
[02:02:18.272 --> 02:02:21.135]  And they will do it at will, and we're going to be at their mercy.
[02:02:21.175 --> 02:02:24.298]  They're going to be managing not just our trade, but our economy.
[02:02:24.338 --> 02:02:28.863]  And so when you look back 20, 30 years ago, Donald Trump was saying the same thing.
[02:02:29.243 --> 02:02:30.464]  He was on Oprah Winfrey.
[02:02:30.484 --> 02:02:32.867]  We let Japan come in and dump everything into our markets.
[02:02:32.967 --> 02:02:34.909]  They knocked the hell out of our companies.
[02:02:34.989 --> 02:02:39.073]  And hey, I've got tremendous respect for the Japanese people, but we have to do something about it.
[02:02:39.113 --> 02:02:42.016]  So Oprah, who was interviewing him about his book,
[02:02:42.216 --> 02:02:44.138]  He says, well, it sounds like you're going to run for office.
[02:02:44.198 --> 02:02:45.639]  And he goes, no, probably not.
[02:02:45.819 --> 02:02:48.401]  But I don't like to see the country getting ripped off.
[02:02:48.721 --> 02:02:50.182]  OK, so that's at least something.
[02:02:50.483 --> 02:02:53.906]  That is a difference that you don't see from any of these other candidates.
[02:02:53.946 --> 02:02:56.748]  They're going to fall in line with the TPP.
[02:02:56.768 --> 02:03:02.332]  They're going to fall in line with the globalist economic situation, which is not a free market.
[02:03:02.573 --> 02:03:03.773]  It is not free trade.
[02:03:04.074 --> 02:03:09.278]  And there's other aspects about this TPP and Trans-Pacific Partnership that are even worse.
[02:03:09.318 --> 02:03:11.360]  I mean, we've got this story coming out today from The Guardian.
[02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:14.482]  Finally, finally, happy birthday, okay?
[02:03:14.642 --> 02:03:22.887]  You may or may not know that Warner Brothers has been saying they own the tune Happy Birthday, and they've been intimidating people now for decades.
[02:03:23.347 --> 02:03:30.191]  There was one documentary filmmaker who wanted to do it on Happy Birthday, and they said, no, you owe us a lot of money.
[02:03:30.231 --> 02:03:32.892]  So she took them to court, and they've now lost in court.
[02:03:33.313 --> 02:03:35.874]  That's what we need to see happen with the TPP.
[02:03:36.214 --> 02:03:36.675]  If we don't
[02:03:37.555 --> 02:03:38.715]  Shut the TPP down.
[02:03:38.995 --> 02:03:45.717]  These copyright issues are going to allow these few multinational corporations to assert ownership over everything.
[02:03:46.057 --> 02:03:51.458]  They're going to manage our economy, they're going to own everything, and they're going to control the internet.
[02:03:51.738 --> 02:03:54.539]  So it's vital that we shut down TPP.
[02:03:54.819 --> 02:04:00.300]  And quite frankly, that is the only thing that I can see that interests me anymore in the presidential race, because
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:09.723]  All these other issues that are really very important, we're going to have to fight for them in other ways besides the presidency, because there isn't anybody there to support that.
[02:04:09.763 --> 02:04:11.423]  But at least there is some good news.
[02:04:11.843 --> 02:04:18.465]  At least if Trump were to get it, he would shut down this globalist economy, this move for global consolidation.
[02:04:18.845 --> 02:04:20.546]  That's why they hate him so much at Davos.
[02:04:20.986 --> 02:04:27.348]  That's why the establishment is pulling out all the stops to try to stop that, because that is a key tool of control.
[02:04:27.788 --> 02:04:37.756]  And it is very important for us to shut that down and the only way, the only person that is in that game that can do that right now at this point would be Trump to be able to shut down the TPP.
[02:04:37.976 --> 02:04:52.008]  He definitely has been outspoken about that and obviously on a sort of a smaller scale of course is the schooling and the indoctrination with that and he has been an outspoken opponent of Common Core saying that that's a terrible thing that
[02:04:52.608 --> 02:05:00.850]  DC shouldn't be teaching your kids, whereas someone like Cruz has come out speaking against homeschooling and things like that.
[02:05:01.450 --> 02:05:03.091]  Well, he hasn't really spoken against homeschooling.
[02:05:03.111 --> 02:05:12.753]  He does it in a very subtle way, but he's introduced some amendments to some legislation that would be a very dangerous entrapment for homeschooling.
[02:05:13.153 --> 02:05:19.215]  What it would do is promise money through a specific Title I funding.
[02:05:19.795 --> 02:05:24.738]  But it would treat homeschools as private schools and it would give them funding from Washington.
[02:05:24.778 --> 02:05:29.141]  You do not, believe me, want to take any money from Washington for your homeschool.
[02:05:29.482 --> 02:05:31.563]  They will impose the same types of controls.
[02:05:31.643 --> 02:05:35.566]  If they call you a private school, they will impose the same types of controls.
[02:05:35.586 --> 02:05:37.627]  They'll try to force Common Core on you.
[02:05:37.667 --> 02:05:41.830]  They will have all kinds of strings attached to that money.
[02:05:42.130 --> 02:05:43.531]  And that's a very dangerous thing.
[02:05:44.052 --> 02:05:47.274]  And Ted Cruz introduced that into this education bill.
[02:05:47.834 --> 02:05:55.039]  And a lot of homeschoolers are very upset about that, and should be, because at the state level we've seen this tactic applied over and over again.
[02:05:55.159 --> 02:06:06.145]  It is a way to take down homeschooling by first offering them this nice little nugget here of money, and then the string comes in and jerks it right out of your throat.
[02:06:06.966 --> 02:06:07.966]  That's what's going to happen.
[02:06:08.407 --> 02:06:08.647]  Right.
[02:06:08.707 --> 02:06:13.510]  Well, I mean, parents are, they're the ones that know what's best for their kids, not the United Nations.
[02:06:14.930 --> 02:06:17.072]  So I think we've got Kit Daniels standing by.
[02:06:19.107 --> 02:06:20.308]  Go ahead, cut.
[02:06:20.708 --> 02:06:21.249]  Yes, Leanne.
[02:06:21.469 --> 02:06:23.691]  I got this really revealing tweet.
[02:06:24.451 --> 02:06:26.553]  It says right here, great news for Trump fans.
[02:06:26.573 --> 02:06:28.334]  His victory is wide-reaching.
[02:06:28.354 --> 02:06:31.297]  29% of 100k income.
[02:06:31.797 --> 02:06:33.138]  29% of women.
[02:06:33.158 --> 02:06:34.939]  30% college grads, if he keeps that up.
[02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:43.086]  Now, the reason I bring this up is earlier on Fox News, they said on, I think it was exit polls, that Trump was getting about 29% of independents' votes.
[02:06:44.827 --> 02:06:52.594]  And last week, GOP strategist Roger Stone also said that Trump has an extreme amount of crossover support from Democrats.
[02:06:53.074 --> 02:06:57.678]  You know, he's got, he's attracting a lot of the blue-collar Democrats that voted for Obama in both 2008 and 2012.
[02:06:57.979 --> 02:07:03.744]  So, and this is why Iowa is so revealing, you know, people are saying that he lost Iowa.
[02:07:04.284 --> 02:07:07.705]  But in fact, his second place finish was a victory.
[02:07:08.165 --> 02:07:11.366]  Because think about it, Iowa was only for registered Republicans.
[02:07:11.426 --> 02:07:14.107]  I think it was just long-term Republicans that were voting in that.
[02:07:14.447 --> 02:07:15.628]  He still came in second place.
[02:07:16.108 --> 02:07:23.310]  And now we see in New Hampshire, in a primary where Independents and Democrats can even vote for Republican candidates, he just ran away with it.
[02:07:23.810 --> 02:07:28.432]  So I think the New Hampshire victory really shows his strength in a general election.
[02:07:29.392 --> 02:07:42.521]  I think in a general election, I think you're right, Kit, you're talking about the fact that he got like 30 some odd percent of the vote, but that holds pretty consistent across all these demographics in terms of income, in terms of sex, in terms of age, and with the independents.
[02:07:42.901 --> 02:07:54.589]  I think it's very clear, it's been clear to me for a long time, that Donald Trump has got a lot of blue-collar support, people who have seen how they've been damaged as we've exported jobs and imported workers.
[02:07:55.049 --> 02:07:59.593]  Those are the people who were Reagan Democrats, and I think you're going to see a lot of those people breaking for Trump.
[02:07:59.633 --> 02:08:03.696]  I think you saw them as independents voting for Trump in New Hampshire as well.
[02:08:03.736 --> 02:08:11.762]  But yeah, it's very interesting to see that that 30% support breaks through across a wide cross-section of demographics.
[02:08:12.122 --> 02:08:24.445]  Yeah, if I could add just one more thing really quickly on Drudge Reports reporting that Hillary Clinton, the only two demographics that she won, I believe, was 65 plus and people that make over $200,000 a year.
[02:08:24.925 --> 02:08:26.046]  Oh, the Goldman Sachs crowd.
[02:08:26.066 --> 02:08:27.486]  Yeah, they don't want to give their money to Bernie.
[02:08:28.046 --> 02:08:30.247]  Yeah, it's like the same as the Jeb Bush crowd.
[02:08:30.267 --> 02:08:32.187]  I mean, you see a Jeb Bush event.
[02:08:32.207 --> 02:08:34.308]  She's supported by the 1%.
[02:08:34.808 --> 02:08:35.568]  That's interesting.
[02:08:35.968 --> 02:08:36.809]  That's very interesting.
[02:08:37.169 --> 02:08:41.210]  Well, it's going to be interesting to see how this breaks down in further contests.
[02:08:42.344 --> 02:08:49.332]  New Hampshire is a more accurate predictor, I think, of the way things are going to go than Iowa was.
[02:08:49.392 --> 02:09:00.143]  Certainly for the Republicans, because we've seen the last several contests in Iowa, they have picked Huckabee, they've picked Santorum.
[02:09:01.204 --> 02:09:02.065]  Iowa is skewed.
[02:09:02.365 --> 02:09:14.777]  The Republican Party is a very small part of the Iowa voters and it's dominated by a few kingmakers who move it towards people who they perceive as being evangelicals.
[02:09:15.258 --> 02:09:17.420]  And that's what Cruz did to win Iowa.
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:19.081]  And that's what happened with Huckabee.
[02:09:19.121 --> 02:09:20.522]  That's what happened with Santorum.
[02:09:20.803 --> 02:09:31.491]  And so if you get a few people that are going to be these kingmakers telling everybody, this guy is the Christian candidate, he's going to win in Iowa, but he's not necessarily going to win anywhere else based on that kind of demographic.
[02:09:31.531 --> 02:09:34.494]  So it really is not a good predictor of who the nominee is.
[02:09:34.734 --> 02:09:39.638]  New Hampshire has been much more accurate in that for the GOP.
[02:09:39.938 --> 02:09:40.478]  Absolutely.
[02:09:40.899 --> 02:09:42.100]  If I may add, I mean,
[02:09:43.666 --> 02:09:48.369]  Ted Cruz, he won the evangelicals, but think about it this way, he had to lie to do it.
[02:09:48.749 --> 02:09:49.510]  Yes, yes.
[02:09:50.170 --> 02:09:50.831]  Exactly.
[02:09:50.851 --> 02:10:00.477]  Yeah, you don't hear him invoking the body of Christ anymore, not in New Hampshire, any other speeches that he's given, so you can sort of really see that pandering, which I did not like at all.
[02:10:00.497 --> 02:10:06.721]  What he did was he stuck a knife in the back of the other candidate that he was competing for for the Christian vote, which is Ben Carson.
[02:10:06.881 --> 02:10:08.782]  It's one of the dirtiest tricks I've ever seen.
[02:10:09.063 --> 02:10:10.644]  It's a tried and true tactic.
[02:10:11.164 --> 02:10:20.289]  That the day of the election, you're going to throw out some false innuendo about somebody and hurt them before they can respond to it and get the truth out.
[02:10:20.690 --> 02:10:30.956]  What Ted Cruz and his entire staff did was, as the caucus was starting, they started spreading this rumor, this lie, that Carson was out.
[02:10:31.596 --> 02:10:34.478]  And that is still really hurting him.
[02:10:34.498 --> 02:10:37.840]  And of course, Carson is not going to his New Hampshire primary party.
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:39.781]  He's flying to Florida again.
[02:10:40.781 --> 02:10:42.884]  You know, he's done this in both of these contests.
[02:10:42.924 --> 02:10:48.450]  He didn't go to the, you know, to the follow-up contest, and he actually didn't even campaign.
[02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:53.075]  He had very little presence there in New Hampshire to start with.
[02:10:53.376 --> 02:10:56.239]  Let's go to Richard Reeves back at the Trump Rap Party.
[02:10:57.890 --> 02:10:58.150]  Okay.
[02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.971]  Thank you, David.
[02:10:59.071 --> 02:11:04.954]  We just heard Donald Trump wrap up his victory speech, and this room is beyond New Year's Eve.
[02:11:05.255 --> 02:11:07.236]  Everybody was so happy and so delighted.
[02:11:07.836 --> 02:11:08.977]  It's unbelievable.
[02:11:09.597 --> 02:11:15.481]  One interesting thing that happened, and I don't know if you guys happened to catch it there in the studio, but when Trump came out,
[02:11:16.361 --> 02:11:18.764]  I'm sure that was just coincidental, wasn't it, Richard?
[02:11:38.865 --> 02:11:41.188]  Yeah, I'm sure he's perfect timing.
[02:11:41.328 --> 02:11:42.249]  One more little jab.
[02:11:42.329 --> 02:11:44.291]  I think that was kind of planned.
[02:11:44.431 --> 02:11:46.273]  It was very interesting to see.
[02:11:46.493 --> 02:11:52.200]  Well, also interesting to see Fox News where they've had this back and forth with them saying, oh, got to cut to Trump.
[02:11:52.742 --> 02:11:52.962]  Yeah.
[02:11:53.563 --> 02:11:55.044]  He's got to bring in the ratings.
[02:11:55.805 --> 02:12:12.999]  They literally in the beginning had a split screen going and I don't know, I couldn't tell whose audio they were carrying but they had a split screen going with Trump on one side, Jeb Bush on the other for a few seconds and I was going to try to take a photo of it to send to you guys but it was gone like before I could get my camera out.
[02:12:13.539 --> 02:12:14.140]  We're good to go.
[02:12:28.456 --> 02:12:42.183]  Could we have imagined the fall of Jeb and now it looks like there's serious cracks in Hillary because it seems like every day that goes by she's losing another quarter percent or a half percent.
[02:12:42.563 --> 02:12:43.724]  Bernie's gaining steam.
[02:12:44.324 --> 02:12:46.826]  Bernie Sanders is probably going to get 20 million dollars.
[02:12:47.665 --> 02:12:50.667]  By small donors because of this victory.
[02:12:50.687 --> 02:12:52.527]  So he's going to have a war chest.
[02:12:53.268 --> 02:12:59.171]  And I tell you what, I think, I don't know if Bernie wants to do it, but his supporters are not going to let him stop.
[02:12:59.191 --> 02:13:01.372]  His supporters, they're going to prop him up.
[02:13:01.672 --> 02:13:03.513]  It'll be like that Weekend at Bernie's thing.
[02:13:03.533 --> 02:13:04.333]  They're going to prop him up.
[02:13:04.393 --> 02:13:05.874]  They're going to make him run.
[02:13:05.994 --> 02:13:06.554]  Yeah.
[02:13:06.654 --> 02:13:09.056]  Even if this old guy dies, they're going to keep it.
[02:13:09.196 --> 02:13:10.296]  It'll be like Weekend at Bernie's.
[02:13:10.316 --> 02:13:11.757]  They'll put him in the car and drive him around.
[02:13:12.771 --> 02:13:16.833]  I would not be surprised if a dead man beats Hillary.
[02:13:16.893 --> 02:13:18.434]  I would not be surprised at all.
[02:13:19.115 --> 02:13:24.598]  There's actually a dance that went viral, the Bernie dance, so we should make a video of that, kind of making fun of it.
[02:13:24.698 --> 02:13:26.699]  That's a very funny thought there.
[02:13:26.719 --> 02:13:28.600]  Well Richard, thank you so much.
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:32.362]  I know you've been working tirelessly out there on the campaign trail.
[02:13:32.942 --> 02:13:33.863]  Any closing comments?
[02:13:34.943 --> 02:13:38.026]  Well, I tell you what, Matt's worked even harder than me.
[02:13:38.086 --> 02:13:42.469]  I keep him up all day and then he goes to the hotel and works on videos all night.
[02:13:42.509 --> 02:13:43.369]  I don't know how he does it.
[02:13:43.409 --> 02:13:47.012]  So anyway, we'll have some more reports coming up.
[02:13:47.112 --> 02:13:49.333]  Thank you guys for doing all y'all do.
[02:13:49.413 --> 02:13:52.375]  It's very exciting to see that we're having such an impact.
[02:13:52.475 --> 02:13:53.436]  Absolutely.
[02:13:53.456 --> 02:13:54.637]  You know, Alex,
[02:13:55.902 --> 02:13:57.364]  Thank you, Alex, for making it happen.
[02:13:57.944 --> 02:14:01.348]  Folks, make sure and go to Infowarriorslife.com and support us that way.
[02:14:01.769 --> 02:14:06.814]  We can't be out here and do this without your guys' support, and you guys have done a wonderful job.
[02:14:06.834 --> 02:14:08.196]  The Infowarriors spreading the word.
[02:14:09.257 --> 02:14:16.004]  It's because of Alex Jones and the Infowarriors that we are where we are, seeing Jeb go down, watching Hillary, the cracks in Hillary.
[02:14:17.706 --> 02:14:28.836]  Mainly good news tonight, but keep an eye on those falling numbers of percentages between the establishment and the renegade candidates in the GOP.
[02:14:29.216 --> 02:14:35.381]  And it looks to me like that anti-establishment vote of 60% potentially is going to carry through.
[02:14:35.422 --> 02:14:37.203]  So it would be lovely to see that part.
[02:14:37.663 --> 02:14:40.446]  Not so great to see who they support and what they support.
[02:14:40.946 --> 02:14:43.969]  But if they're going against Hillary, I'll tell you, it's hard to be against it.
[02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.449]  Yeah.
[02:14:45.330 --> 02:14:46.231]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:14:46.291 --> 02:14:47.491]  Richard Reeves will be checking in.
[02:14:47.571 --> 02:14:51.634]  We will be waiting on those reports you've got coming in from the campaign trail.
[02:14:51.654 --> 02:14:52.454]  Thank you so much.
[02:14:53.035 --> 02:14:55.596]  And just to wrap up real quickly here, what our vote totals are.
[02:14:55.636 --> 02:14:57.157]  We're at 50% right now.
[02:14:57.417 --> 02:15:00.679]  Trump is at 50% of the votes have come in and been counted.
[02:15:00.999 --> 02:15:01.379]  Trump is at 34%.
[02:15:01.419 --> 02:15:02.800]  Second place, Kasich at 16.
[02:15:02.900 --> 02:15:03.421]  Cruz at 12.
[02:15:05.942 --> 02:15:08.183]  Bush and Rubio are tied at 11.
[02:15:08.283 --> 02:15:11.685]  Bush just slightly ahead, maybe about 1,000 votes ahead.
[02:15:12.065 --> 02:15:13.026]  Christie is still at 8%.
[02:15:13.166 --> 02:15:16.448]  He's not made that 10% threshold.
[02:15:17.168 --> 02:15:23.292]  So he and Fiorina and Carson's votes, which total up to 14%, those would go up to Trump.
[02:15:23.312 --> 02:15:27.934]  So he will get delegates based on 48% at this point in time.
[02:15:28.395 --> 02:15:32.317]  And Christie and Fiorina would not make the next GOP debate.
[02:15:33.134 --> 02:15:53.799]  Well, I gotta say though, for the entertainment value, I've been enjoying Chris Christie up there, so it'll be probably a little bit more boring there with this next upcoming debate, but I really liked some of Richard's closing comments there with just how incredible it is to watch the downfall of the Clinton legacy and the
[02:15:53.919 --> 02:15:54.039]  Yeah.
[02:15:54.059 --> 02:16:10.909]  And the Bush Empire, and almost as if all of these stories out there of the bad omens, of the economic crash, and the world is going to be set on fire, oh my goodness, it could actually be because the elite are seeing their reign over.
[02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:17.673]  The people are awakening, they are rising, and it is thanks to alternative voices out there who are able to break through that mainstream media narrative.
[02:16:18.394 --> 02:16:23.377]  But that could be the real doom and gloom, is the fact that the world, it is changing.
[02:16:23.677 --> 02:16:24.358]  That's pretty interesting.
[02:16:24.418 --> 02:16:27.682]  Hillary is taking a shlacking from Sanders, that's for sure.
[02:16:27.702 --> 02:16:27.982]  59% to 39%.
[02:16:29.685 --> 02:16:33.850]  And so, yeah, she's going to be content with a second place finish, she said.
[02:16:33.870 --> 02:16:35.192]  And she got that.
[02:16:35.652 --> 02:16:41.760]  I wonder if she is content with a 20% deficit to Bernie Sanders, because that's what she's got.
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:49.164]  Right, and that's a pretty telling, like I keep saying because I can't believe, I mean it was already rigged in her favor going into this.
[02:16:49.264 --> 02:16:52.946]  Well if you look at the delegates, he's got 13 delegates but she's got 12.
[02:16:53.046 --> 02:16:58.750]  Even though it's 60-40, she's got the same number of delegates out of this that he did, as if it were 50-50.
[02:16:59.190 --> 02:17:02.872]  So they know how to get the bottom line rigged.
[02:17:03.012 --> 02:17:08.755]  Even if it is a shellacking in terms of the popular votes, she's still hanging in there at 50-50.
[02:17:08.796 --> 02:17:10.436]  And didn't you say she's got something like 400?
[02:17:11.437 --> 02:17:16.081]  Yeah, she started that night, she had 422 delegates to his 30-some-odd delegates.
[02:17:16.141 --> 02:17:19.883]  So we can't count her out right now.
[02:17:20.164 --> 02:17:25.588]  She's going to use this to campaign as the underdog, just as Larry Nichols said.
[02:17:25.628 --> 02:17:27.429]  This is exactly what she wants.
[02:17:27.469 --> 02:17:31.612]  She wants to be the underdog, she wants to go out to her supporters and say, look, you've got to get behind me.
[02:17:31.952 --> 02:17:33.113]  But she is not the underdog.
[02:17:33.153 --> 02:17:37.897]  She's got 422 delegates and Bernie Sanders only has 30-some-odd delegates.
[02:17:38.308 --> 02:17:38.528]  Right.
[02:17:38.668 --> 02:17:52.595]  And so of course, you know, going forward, we're going to see more of this horse race and it is going to, because we do have so many people out there who are awake, they are excited, they are involved with this political game that's going on this year.
[02:17:52.635 --> 02:17:56.057]  They're going to kind of want to keep everyone's attention going back and forth.
[02:17:56.437 --> 02:17:57.078]  Who's going to win?
[02:17:57.118 --> 02:17:58.578]  Oh my gosh, Rubio's third place.
[02:17:58.959 --> 02:18:06.743]  So there is sort of an agenda to keep the masses sort of distracted of getting behind their person who the
[02:18:07.663 --> 02:18:10.206]  The establishment has chosen for them to decide between.
[02:18:10.666 --> 02:18:18.874]  Meanwhile, we're going to go to this report from John Bowne, where behind the scenes, where we're right now with this election cycle, we are being distracted.
[02:18:19.155 --> 02:18:24.640]  There's so much going on behind the scenes that's gearing up for war and other sorts of things.
[02:18:25.161 --> 02:18:27.363]  While, of course, we're being batted left and right.
[02:18:27.503 --> 02:18:28.264]  Let's go to that report.
[02:18:57.275 --> 02:19:15.071]  While good Americans focus on the struggle associated with putting their votes, livelihood, and the future of their children into the hands of corporatized, career-criminal politicians, the monstrosity known as the military-industrial complex is strategizing an incoming wave of global horror
[02:19:15.191 --> 02:19:15.551]  I'm good.
[02:19:33.217 --> 02:19:38.962]  Widely known to most Americans on a recent appearance on Michael Savage's The Savage Nation.
[02:19:39.182 --> 02:19:47.849]  I'm excited over the DHS agent who worked there 15 years who said that Obama personally ordered him to expunge all records of dangerous Muslim front groups in America.
[02:19:48.229 --> 02:19:50.671]  You're the only one bringing up this issue, Donald.
[02:19:50.691 --> 02:19:51.492]  I know.
[02:19:51.712 --> 02:19:56.816]  It's radical Islamic terrorism and we have a president that won't even use the words.
[02:19:57.857 --> 02:20:02.623]  Not only is Trump's sentiment widely known among Americans, it is also widely known in Syria and Iraq.
[02:20:12.594 --> 02:20:13.955]  Well just how obvious is it?
[02:20:14.015 --> 02:20:16.658]  The White House gave ISIS 45 minute warnings before meekly bombing their tankers.
[02:20:29.511 --> 02:20:33.153]  A fleet of oil tankers Russia obliterated in a matter of days.
[02:20:33.413 --> 02:20:40.597]  The US State Department funneled 43 Toyota trucks to ISIS via the non-existent Free Syrian Army.
[02:20:40.757 --> 02:20:45.820]  And who could ever forget multiple accidental airdrops of weapons to ISIS?
[02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:53.164]  Or the declassified Pentagon document clearly strategizing ISIS's conquest as an intended objective.
[02:20:53.624 --> 02:20:58.267]  Simply put, the treasonous cat has been out of the bag for quite some time now.
[02:20:58.607 --> 02:21:06.792]  So what are Obama and his multi-billionaire global masters scheming up now to counteract the collapse of their highly malicious actions?
[02:21:07.392 --> 02:21:10.434]  In a true display of fact being stranger than fiction,
[02:21:10.794 --> 02:21:24.665]  They're sending in Saudi Arabia to Syria in order to curb Russian-Iranian security forces, Hezbollah and Iraq-Shia fighters as they close in on the major jihadist stronghold of Aleppo and surrounding countryside.
[02:21:24.966 --> 02:21:40.198]  Kurt Nimmo writes, the invasion reportedly planned for March and billed as an offensive against the Islamic State will put the Saudi coalition into direct conflict with the SAA, Iranian security forces, Hezbollah, Iraq-Shia militias and the Russians.
[02:21:40.518 --> 02:21:52.603]  Following the establishment of a Russian airbase in Syria near the Turkish border, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey may enter the war on the side of the jihadists fighting against the al-Assad government.
[02:21:52.824 --> 02:21:58.546]  Last year's downing of a Russian aircraft appears to be part of a larger strategy by the United States.
[02:21:58.846 --> 02:22:07.070]  In October, leading globalist Zbigniew Brzezinski told the Financial Times he advised Obama to disarm the Russians if they keep attacking.
[02:22:07.250 --> 02:22:09.912]  The CIA trained militants in Syria.
[02:22:10.172 --> 02:22:17.518]  Brzezinski said the Russian naval and air presences in Syria are vulnerable, isolated geographically from their homeland.
[02:22:17.698 --> 02:22:21.461]  They could be disarmed if they persist in provoking the US.
[02:22:21.741 --> 02:22:22.442]  He continued,
[02:22:22.802 --> 02:22:25.784]  In these rapidly unfolding circumstances, the U.S.
[02:22:25.824 --> 02:22:30.687]  has only one real option if it is to protect its wider stakes in the region.
[02:22:30.907 --> 02:22:37.832]  To convey to Moscow the demand that it cease and desist from military actions that directly affect American assets.
[02:22:38.092 --> 02:22:42.213]  The Saudi-led invasion is part of the strategy outlined by Brzezinski.
[02:22:42.414 --> 02:22:48.035]  It is designed to raise the stakes for Russia and its partners and drive Iran out of Syria.
[02:22:48.216 --> 02:22:55.338]  The strategy, however, is highly risky and is likely to result in an escalation and widening of the conflict.
[02:22:55.458 --> 02:22:55.939]  We're good to go.
[02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:46.527]  So of course that's what it's going to be very important to keep our eyes on as we're being distracted with this politics game.
[02:23:46.607 --> 02:23:52.374]  There is always something else bigger, much bigger going on when they have us all massively distracted like this.
[02:23:52.864 --> 02:23:53.464]  And that's the key.
[02:23:53.604 --> 02:24:03.570]  We, as libertarians, have to understand that the true struggle for our individual rights is going to be done by us at the local level, at the state level.
[02:24:03.630 --> 02:24:05.371]  I said that while Rand Paul was still in.
[02:24:05.431 --> 02:24:06.552]  It's even more true now.
[02:24:06.932 --> 02:24:11.174]  The candidates that are there are not going to help you to get your freedom back.
[02:24:11.274 --> 02:24:12.335]  They're just not on the table.
[02:24:13.035 --> 02:24:18.941]  One thing that can come out of this that I think would be good out of a Trump victory and that would be to shut down the TPP.
[02:24:19.001 --> 02:24:33.434]  I think it's one of the reasons why our enemies hate Donald Trump so much because he would oppose their globalist takeover, these massive economic unions, the TPP, the transatlantic, trans-pacific partnerships.
[02:24:33.874 --> 02:24:35.276]  That is a key issue.
[02:24:35.956 --> 02:24:41.057]  And that's the only thing that really distinguishes these candidates, in my opinion, from my perspective.
[02:24:41.097 --> 02:24:46.158]  Certainly not on any of the individual liberty issues, but that is still a key issue, I think.
[02:24:46.378 --> 02:24:46.558]  Right.
[02:24:46.638 --> 02:24:50.399]  And I mean, he's spoken out against mandatory vaccination and Common Core and things like that.
[02:24:50.439 --> 02:24:50.639]  True.
[02:24:50.659 --> 02:24:51.699]  There's some other things, yeah.
[02:24:51.919 --> 02:24:52.479]  There's some other issues.
[02:24:52.499 --> 02:24:53.039]  But I agree.
[02:24:53.279 --> 02:24:57.120]  There is the reason why the establishment hates Trump and wants to take him down.
[02:24:57.140 --> 02:24:57.620]  Yeah.
[02:24:57.740 --> 02:25:02.081]  So I guess, if New Hampshire is any indication this time around, he's got a pretty good shot there.
[02:25:02.341 --> 02:25:03.042]  Yeah, that's good.
[02:25:03.423 --> 02:25:03.763]  That's good.
[02:25:04.204 --> 02:25:07.849]  So we like to see things just because it's the enemy of our enemies.
[02:25:08.089 --> 02:25:08.890]  That's one good thing.
[02:25:09.251 --> 02:25:17.502]  It's a great way to give the establishment the middle finger, but it's also a great way to shut down these globalist trade agreements, and that is really, really key, I think.
[02:25:17.972 --> 02:25:18.493]  Absolutely.
[02:25:19.194 --> 02:25:21.677]  Well, I guess that's it for our show tonight.
[02:25:21.777 --> 02:25:27.784]  We really appreciate you guys joining us live for our more than two hour coverage of the New Hampshire primaries.
