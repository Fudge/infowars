[00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:22.322]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:23.703]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.863 --> 00:00:28.083]  It is April 29th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:43.626]  Tonight, anti-Trump agitators are triggered into a riot in Southern California as InfoWars captures the chaos from the land of idiocracy.
[00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.483]  I just saw, he just got triggered by us.
[00:01:00.148 --> 00:01:12.035]  Then the surveillance state comes out in the open and there is now a Supreme Court ruling that officially allows the FBI to hack and surveil your computer.
[00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:18.859]  And a bong hit just cost a top NFL prospect a whopping eight million dollars.
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.703]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:06.151]  Now coming up later in our show, we'll have footage of our crew out in California.
[00:03:06.492 --> 00:03:12.876]  They went to a Trump demonstration or anti-Trump demonstration last night, and they caught a lot of violence on camera.
[00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:14.557]  Like I said, we'll show you those videos later on.
[00:03:14.597 --> 00:03:18.819]  But if you go to the top of Drudge, that's all the rays, that's all they're talking about right now.
[00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:25.343]  Trump is actually at a different event as we speak, meeting with various people, and there were protesters out there to greet him.
[00:03:27.284 --> 00:03:33.671]  The issue I have with these protests or protesters more accurately is the way that they're going about it.
[00:03:34.011 --> 00:03:44.783]  I talked about this last time with the self-righteous social justice warrior, this person who is so angry at Trump or any political contender for that matter, that they feel it is
[00:03:46.204 --> 00:03:55.208]  Perfectly acceptable to go out to a protest and spin people's faces, to pepper spray little girls, to do donuts in the street and endanger other people.
[00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:57.829]  This is the mindset that these people have.
[00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.170]  You know, I'm not a Trump demonstrator, you guys know that.
[00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.851]  I'm not a Hillary supporter.
[00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:03.892]  I'm not a Bernie supporter.
[00:04:03.912 --> 00:04:06.713]  With all that said, I would not go to a Hillary Clinton event
[00:04:07.293 --> 00:04:11.195]  And pepper spray little girls in the face or pepper spray somebody who is around little girls.
[00:04:11.256 --> 00:04:16.139]  I wouldn't go to a Bernie demonstration to do donuts in the street and endanger the people out there.
[00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.980]  I wouldn't go to a Trump demonstration and punch somebody in the face.
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.581]  It's how these people are acting.
[00:04:20.962 --> 00:04:27.746]  Meanwhile, they want to call him a racist, fascist, sexist, bigot, whatever, you know, they want to call him this week.
[00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:34.150]  And a lot of times when they talk to these guys, if you watch the videos that are coming up, they ask them, what is your issue with Donald Trump?
[00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:45.438]  And no, for many, as many things that you could say legitimately about the guy, you could talk about the torture aspect, or the wall, or the lack of domestic privacy.
[00:04:45.458 --> 00:04:49.341]  He wants to, you know, have all these measures to get into your devices and all that.
[00:04:49.582 --> 00:04:55.246]  Legitimate criticism of the guy, but people say he's violent against Mexicans.
[00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:57.428]  I'm like, when did he say he's violent against Mexicans?
[00:04:57.828 --> 00:05:01.069]  I'm as skeptical about the guy as many of the people at that demonstration.
[00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.390]  I've never heard him say that.
[00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.871]  Similar things when he talks, when people talk about he's violent against Muslims.
[00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:10.252]  I've never heard him say he wants to be violent towards Muslims.
[00:05:10.292 --> 00:05:16.554]  Now, he did say he wants to torture the families or is up to torture the families of terrorism suspects.
[00:05:16.854 --> 00:05:24.717]  Those people aren't always necessarily Muslim, but that's really the only violence I've heard come out of the guy's mouth or, you know, condoning of violence.
[00:05:25.237 --> 00:05:29.523]  Other than that, these people don't even want to criticize him for the things that he actually said and believes.
[00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:34.989]  They just want to go out there and endanger other people for their own means, but we'll have all those videos coming up here shortly.
[00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:43.480]  And as I was talking about the surveillance apparatus with Trump, we now see this article, Supreme Court ruling allows FBI to hack and surveil computers.
[00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:53.383]  Prior to the decision, Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure authorized search and seizure by law enforcement only within their own jurisdiction.
[00:05:53.843 --> 00:06:04.566]  Approved amendments to the code now permit the FBI and others to hack into computers and seize data, even if that computer's actual location has been concealed through technical means such as TOR.
[00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:12.348]  As it stands, the proposed amendments allow the FBI to use a wide array of invasive and potentially destructive hacking techniques
[00:06:12.808 --> 00:06:13.289]  We're good to go.
[00:06:35.564 --> 00:06:36.124]  Mindset.
[00:06:36.184 --> 00:06:43.528]  If you think about the situation now, a lot of law enforcement agencies around the country are starting to do this thing where you get pulled over and they want to look in your phone.
[00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:50.252]  You know, for really no reason, you know, you get pulled over for a busted taillight, they could potentially say, I want to look at your phone, see if you were texting.
[00:06:50.272 --> 00:06:51.213]  He's like, I wasn't texting.
[00:06:51.253 --> 00:06:53.874]  My phone was in my pocket or it's in my purse or whatever else.
[00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:56.916]  But they just use this as an excuse to check your data.
[00:06:57.276 --> 00:07:01.098]  A similar thing when you look at the Apple phone and the whole recent controversy with that.
[00:07:01.458 --> 00:07:07.461]  They said that they wanted Apple to build a backdoor for them to use anytime they felt like it, but it's only a one-time deal.
[00:07:07.601 --> 00:07:08.461]  People didn't buy that.
[00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:17.305]  So, eventually they hacked the phone, spent millions of dollars or at least a million dollars to do so, and they're not any better for it in my personal opinion.
[00:07:17.345 --> 00:07:21.247]  John McAfee told them how to hack the phone without using all this expensive equipment, but
[00:07:21.627 --> 00:07:23.368]  Bureaucracy wouldn't allow that to happen.
[00:07:23.388 --> 00:07:27.631]  They had to spend money and make a big deal out of it just to get into Apple's face about it.
[00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:33.734]  It seems like every day they find a new way to take our privacy away from us when it comes to our electronic devices.
[00:07:33.755 --> 00:07:36.856]  Now I want to talk about a story that's going on overseas.
[00:07:36.876 --> 00:07:41.099]  Not so much the lack of privacy, but the lack of life that's going on in Syria.
[00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:43.921]  The Syrian conflict has been going on for some time.
[00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:48.664]  It's been heating, escalating, and now this is the latest in a string of attacks.
[00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:52.925]  Syrian airstrikes hit hospital, kill at least 20 in Aleppo.
[00:07:53.565 --> 00:08:05.669]  Several airstrikes hit a well-known hospital in a rebel-held area of Aleppo, killing at least 20 people, including three children, a dentist, and one of the last pediatricians left in the divided city.
[00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:10.834]  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Thursday.
[00:08:11.294 --> 00:08:16.199]  Doctors Without Borders said 14 patients at the hospital at Bax were among the dead.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.643]  Opposition leaders blamed the government of Assad.
[00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:23.567]  Now, I was trying to do some research and make sure that this was Assad.
[00:08:23.747 --> 00:08:29.293]  Multiple news agencies are saying that it is Assad, but I'm always skeptical when I hear things of that.
[00:08:29.913 --> 00:08:35.058]  Not that Asada is a good guy, but we've seen multiple times they try to blame him for stuff that he didn't do.
[00:08:35.338 --> 00:08:41.905]  Case in point, the chemical weapons attacks, I believe of 2013, if I remember correctly.
[00:08:42.325 --> 00:08:46.349]  Basically, if you guys remember those attacks, it was all over the news on
[00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:54.452]  Mainstream media here in the States that Assad was running around tear gassing people or chemical weaponing, using chemical weapons to kill people.
[00:08:54.832 --> 00:09:04.055]  And the issue about that was, if you look at those videos, in the corner they had a watermark that was an Al-Qaeda watermark or, you know, these extremist group watermarks.
[00:09:04.075 --> 00:09:08.516]  I'm like, well, why would Assad film these things, put them up on the internet with the watermark?
[00:09:08.596 --> 00:09:09.496]  It was a complete bull.
[00:09:09.556 --> 00:09:11.137]  So I'm always skeptical, but
[00:09:11.437 --> 00:09:19.804]  For right now I'll take their word for it that it was Assad and hopefully we'll get some cooler heads to prevail out there and get some answers as to why this hospital was destroyed.
[00:09:20.265 --> 00:09:26.750]  But now we have new answers or the answers that they want us to hear as far as why the hospital was destroyed last year.
[00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:29.313]  If you guys recall the attack in Afghanistan.
[00:09:29.873 --> 00:09:35.015]  Where the Doctors Without Borders facility in Afghanistan was hit by U.S.
[00:09:35.515 --> 00:09:35.956]  artillery.
[00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:36.796]  And we see this.
[00:09:37.096 --> 00:09:40.277]  Pentagon announces punishments in deadly hospital attack.
[00:09:40.317 --> 00:09:42.698]  And this is back in October of 2015.
[00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:43.699]  A U.S.
[00:09:43.859 --> 00:09:53.443]  aerial gunship attack on a hospital in Afghanistan that killed at least 42 people occurred because of human errors, process mistakes, and equipment failures.
[00:09:53.943 --> 00:09:55.585]  And none of the aircrew or U.S.
[00:09:55.605 --> 00:09:59.048]  ground troops knew the target was a hospital atop U.S.
[00:09:59.108 --> 00:10:00.230]  General said Friday.
[00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:06.336]  Now, once again, this somewhat conflicts with what we've heard from Doctors Without Borders.
[00:10:06.696 --> 00:10:11.901]  They've been saying that they knew that it was, in fact, a hospital they've been operating out of there for some time.
[00:10:13.142 --> 00:10:20.004]  The rationale at the time, back in October 2015, was that militants were using this facility for some reason.
[00:10:20.024 --> 00:10:21.365]  I don't know if that's true.
[00:10:21.445 --> 00:10:27.087]  Maybe they went in at some point to get patched up, but it wasn't an official base of operations.
[00:10:27.207 --> 00:10:29.447]  That's what Doctors Without Borders is saying.
[00:10:29.807 --> 00:10:34.229]  And now they're saying that 16 military members from this incident have been
[00:10:35.109 --> 00:10:35.629]  Discipline
[00:10:51.194 --> 00:10:53.515]  It was an equipment failure, mistakes were made.
[00:10:53.815 --> 00:10:56.116]  There's no reason to investigate this any further.
[00:10:56.396 --> 00:11:02.938]  The guys retired when this attack happened and they've been disciplined but nobody's actually going to go to jail or face any charges.
[00:11:03.378 --> 00:11:11.560]  Now once again, when you talk about these attacks overseas, whether it's a manned gunship or a drone or whatever, these guys are hitting targets that they're told to hit.
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.702]  So I'm not even so much mad at the individuals in the gunship or the drone operators.
[00:11:17.062 --> 00:11:20.805]  They're being told, hit X target, you know, an X area, and take it out.
[00:11:20.966 --> 00:11:28.572]  So it's really the guys who give the orders, not so much the guys who pull the trigger, even though you do have a manner of discretion in that, or at least I'd hope you would.
[00:11:29.513 --> 00:11:31.095]  So that's always the deal.
[00:11:31.135 --> 00:11:38.381]  There's no sense of accountability, and that's the big issue with the drone program, and now we're even seeing it with gunships.
[00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:42.885]  Nobody wants to be held responsible, because you guys have seen that old video, that WikiLeaks video.
[00:11:43.926 --> 00:11:44.206]  I think so.
[00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:02.940]  In the minivan.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.041]  It's completely ridiculous.
[00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:09.187]  And then you can hear one of the guys up in the gunship saying, well, they shouldn't bring their kids to a battle zone.
[00:12:09.227 --> 00:12:10.548]  It's like, they live there.
[00:12:10.588 --> 00:12:12.010]  They don't have any place to go.
[00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.331]  That's where their home is.
[00:12:13.351 --> 00:12:17.535]  The little bit that they have is based in that country, in that area, in that region.
[00:12:17.555 --> 00:12:19.678]  They can't just pick up sticks and move down I-35 like I could.
[00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:22.780]  Living here in Austin and go down to San Antonio.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:32.966]  It's not an option for everybody out there, so I really wish people would get rid of that mentality, that sucks for them type of mentality, because sooner or later, that type of mentality will come home to you.
[00:12:33.426 --> 00:12:41.190]  And speaking of a guy who's not going to be coming home anytime soon, we see that North Korea has sentenced another American to hard labor.
[00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.351]  Now, this particular guy
[00:12:42.711 --> 00:12:42.891]  I think.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.781]  And he's basically being used as a political pawn.
[00:13:04.801 --> 00:13:06.721]  That's the same thing they say here in this article.
[00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:18.104]  It's got just a political football to be used at a later date whenever it suits North Korea to try to make some type of exchange or whatever they might want to do with the unfortunate gentleman.
[00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:20.265]  And this is Kim Dong Chul.
[00:13:21.205 --> 00:13:23.546]  They say he's been spying for a little bit of time now.
[00:13:23.566 --> 00:13:26.427]  Let's talk about some things going on here in the States now.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:37.679]  I will caution you, the next story I'm about to mention isn't the most hard-hitting news of the day, but I think it is interesting as a sign of the times and just a general view of American culture.
[00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:42.318]  The bong hit that cost a top NFL prospect $8 million.
[00:13:42.338 --> 00:13:50.204]  Now basically, if you don't know, this is a young NFL recruit who had, you know, smoked some bongs.
[00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:51.505]  Like Lord Vader.
[00:13:51.845 --> 00:13:52.866]  What movie was that?
[00:13:52.886 --> 00:13:55.168]  He's like, Luke, I am your stoner.
[00:13:55.208 --> 00:13:56.729]  That's what that guy looks like right there.
[00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.311]  Anyway, this is Laramie Tunsil.
[00:13:59.712 --> 00:14:00.933]  He's an NFL prospect.
[00:14:01.313 --> 00:14:03.955]  And basically he admitted to smoking a bong some time ago.
[00:14:03.995 --> 00:14:05.016]  He said it was a dumb mistake.
[00:14:05.056 --> 00:14:05.897]  He wouldn't do it again.
[00:14:06.537 --> 00:14:09.459]  But right before the NFL draft, somebody posted a video.
[00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:12.641]  He said somebody hacked his account, put this video on his social media.
[00:14:13.101 --> 00:14:14.742]  Maybe the NFL saw it, maybe they didn't.
[00:14:14.782 --> 00:14:23.548]  And he dropped several notches in the draft because of that, or people speculate he's supposed to be taken by the Baltimore Ravens as a number six pick.
[00:14:23.848 --> 00:14:27.930]  For $20 million, he ended up going 13th to the Miami Dolphins for $12 million.
[00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.691]  And once again, I'm not crying over the guy.
[00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:31.072]  He's still making $12 million.
[00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:34.855]  But the point I'm trying to make with this is when we look at the sports stars, the
[00:14:35.595 --> 00:14:38.297]  Celebrities and, you know, Kardashian, whoever.
[00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:45.460]  I think American culture is so keen on coming down hard on these guys for doing things in their personal time.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.643]  Case in point, if you guys recall, Michael Phelps back in 2009, was it?
[00:14:50.523 --> 00:14:52.624]  After he won all these Olympic gold medals.
[00:14:52.664 --> 00:14:53.865]  They said he was Captain America.
[00:14:53.885 --> 00:15:01.289]  You know, he's on Sports Illustrated and the Wheaties box and he's got all these medals and they want to come down hard on this guy because they saw him smoking
[00:15:02.049 --> 00:15:02.549]  I think so.
[00:15:21.334 --> 00:15:22.795]  The pro wrestler Rob Van Dam.
[00:15:23.176 --> 00:15:26.038]  A bunch of guys who use marijuana in their own personal time.
[00:15:26.419 --> 00:15:33.925]  But the point I'm making is, like a lot of the parents or the naysayers who want to come down hard on these athletes, they're addicted to Oxycontin.
[00:15:33.965 --> 00:15:36.308]  They go drunk drive after they leave the bar.
[00:15:36.648 --> 00:15:37.629]  This is a true story.
[00:15:37.689 --> 00:15:39.851]  Back when I used to work at the jail when I was in Oklahoma.
[00:15:41.155 --> 00:15:43.277]  There were two guys who were sitting right next to each other.
[00:15:43.297 --> 00:15:49.483]  I can't remember exactly what they were arrested for, but one guy had an alcohol-related offense, and the other guy had a drug-related offense.
[00:15:49.784 --> 00:15:56.470]  And the alcohol guy was sitting up there all snobby and snooty, talking down to the guy who got arrested on the drug charge.
[00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.592]  Meanwhile, they're both sitting in the county jail.
[00:15:58.873 --> 00:15:59.914]  And it's just the mentality.
[00:15:59.934 --> 00:16:03.758]  The alcohol guy was like, my high is legal, so I'm better than you.
[00:16:03.798 --> 00:16:04.959]  And I think that's the mentality
[00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:17.190]  When we look at drug offenses here in the United States of America, especially when it goes to our celebrity, it's one of those things that, you know, you need to pull the beam out of your own eye before you worry about the speck in someone else's.
[00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:26.318]  And this is a perfect lead-in, I wasn't even planning this, but now Bill Nye and the head of the Weather Channel, or should I say the founder of the Weather Channel, are now going at it
[00:16:26.878 --> 00:16:40.033]  Over the film The Climate Hustle, basically the founder of the Weather Channel is saying that global warming, man-made global warming, is a hoax, it's a pseudoscience, and Bill Nye is saying no, of these climate change deniers need to be put in jail.
[00:16:40.334 --> 00:16:47.402]  So now they're going at it and he's saying that Bill Nye, the founder, is saying that Bill Nye is a fake or pretend scientist in a bow tie.
[00:16:47.702 --> 00:16:54.184]  Now, I'm not a climatologist, I'm not a meteorologist or any-ologist, but basically my opinion is this.
[00:16:54.424 --> 00:17:00.266]  Every time I talk to somebody about global warming, let's say everything about global warming we hear is true hook, line, and sinker.
[00:17:00.766 --> 00:17:04.707]  What is paying a private carbon tax to Al Gore going to do to stop the problem?
[00:17:05.407 --> 00:17:15.497]  Me being a single male who lives in a one-bedroom apartment and owns one vehicle, why should I have to pay a carbon tax when all these other people have way more money and putting out much more carbon than I do?
[00:17:15.517 --> 00:17:17.619]  That's just a basic argument I have to people.
[00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:21.382]  There's more than that I'd like to exchange with you, but I don't have the time for it.
[00:17:21.682 --> 00:17:28.489]  We're gonna move on now to our next article about an 11-year-old boy who shot a home intruder and said that he started to cry like a baby.
[00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:33.233]  I told him I was going to kill him all that with a gun if he didn't get out of my house.
[00:17:33.573 --> 00:17:37.196]  When he was coming downstairs and told me he was going to kill me and F you all that.
[00:17:37.617 --> 00:17:42.441]  I shot through a hamper that he was carrying and it was a full metal jacket bullet.
[00:17:43.963 --> 00:17:45.804]  I went straight through the bag and hit him in his leg.
[00:17:45.824 --> 00:17:49.488]  And he started crying like a little baby.
[00:17:49.828 --> 00:17:52.791]  I hope you learned your lesson from coming to this house trying to steal stuff.
[00:17:53.516 --> 00:17:59.040]  And finally for tonight, before we go into more special reports, how to quit your job and travel for two years.
[00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:01.422]  Now, this is a good story.
[00:18:01.502 --> 00:18:03.404]  I think it's just about saving money.
[00:18:03.664 --> 00:18:09.468]  Regardless, if you want to quit your job, you want to travel, they have some basic common sense things you can do in this article to save money.
[00:18:09.528 --> 00:18:12.891]  So hopefully you won't have to work as hard and will actually be able to take a vacation.
[00:18:13.391 --> 00:18:16.213]  Now stay tuned because right after this break, we'll have more special reports.
[00:18:16.493 --> 00:18:20.937]  We'll have the crew out in California and you can see all the crazy things that went on there for yourself.
[00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:43.372]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:18:43.632 --> 00:18:45.773]  You better believe you got one!
[00:19:04.899 --> 00:19:06.339]  There's a very important question.
[00:19:08.168 --> 00:19:09.309]  That needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.091]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.772 --> 00:19:15.754]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.434 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:53.816]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2, Survival Shield, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:54.137 --> 00:22:56.518]  Again, that's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:23:03.939 --> 00:23:14.144]  Now, Cynthia McKinney, former congresswoman, has been demonized so much by the left and the right, and they literally put a congressman in to take her place who thinks that islands float.
[00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:14.644]  Remember that?
[00:23:15.165 --> 00:23:15.565]  That guy?
[00:23:16.025 --> 00:23:17.005]  That's who they replaced her with.
[00:23:17.906 --> 00:23:19.347]  He thought that Guam would capsize.
[00:23:20.127 --> 00:23:31.893]  Because she would get up there and talk about the child kidnapping rings that were in the Chicago Tribune with DynCorp, and men, women, and children being disappeared, and vaccine deaths in the troops.
[00:23:34.585 --> 00:23:35.365]  That's why they went after her.
[00:23:35.445 --> 00:23:40.587]  And that's why they claimed that she would get in fights with the Capitol cops when they were ordered to harass her.
[00:23:41.987 --> 00:23:44.848]  Because of what she actually stood for, because she had courage.
[00:23:45.989 --> 00:23:50.890]  And that's why they're scared of Bernie Sanders, that's why they're scared of Donald Trump, that's why they're scared of her.
[00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.671]  They're scared of anybody they don't control.
[00:23:52.711 --> 00:23:58.453]  That's why you have the Communist Chinese that Mao Zedong, according to the Chinese Communists, killed 84 million people.
[00:23:58.773 --> 00:24:00.974]  CIA says 60-something, but they're the ones that put him in.
[00:24:02.213 --> 00:24:03.934]  You've got them saying we can't have Donald Trump.
[00:24:03.974 --> 00:24:07.637]  I got big problems with Donald Trump, with his spying and torture and all the rest of it.
[00:24:07.657 --> 00:24:10.719]  But the point is, they don't like him because he doesn't want war with Russia.
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.361]  He doesn't want unfair trade deals.
[00:24:12.401 --> 00:24:13.101]  They're coming after him.
[00:24:13.442 --> 00:24:22.408]  And that's really the biggest seal of approval you can find, the red badge of courage, is if the establishment across the political spectrum hates you.
[00:24:23.589 --> 00:24:28.513]  The mainstream media has a 6% believability, according to the Associated Press just two weeks ago.
[00:24:28.953 --> 00:24:30.935]  I know I'm hammering that point, but it's so important.
[00:24:32.867 --> 00:24:35.269]  And so she's been the Green Party candidate.
[00:24:35.349 --> 00:24:39.172]  She's gone all over the world to war zones when Libya's getting bombed and Syria.
[00:24:39.192 --> 00:24:40.412]  She just has incredible courage.
[00:24:40.432 --> 00:24:42.134]  A lot more courage than I got.
[00:24:42.154 --> 00:24:45.516]  I mean, quite frankly, I got the courage to do it, but I don't want to get killed.
[00:24:45.876 --> 00:24:47.057]  I want to keep doing my work here.
[00:24:47.918 --> 00:24:49.459]  But she goes into war zones, you name it.
[00:24:50.259 --> 00:24:51.480]  RunCynthiaRun.org.
[00:24:52.561 --> 00:24:57.946]  She's also a doctor, I guess, gets a whole bunch of political science, you name it, and she knows her stuff.
[00:24:58.086 --> 00:25:06.113]  And I'm always trying to get her on the show, she's really busy, but she reached out to us and so did another gentleman that's going to be on for part of the interview with us coming up.
[00:25:06.133 --> 00:25:09.035]  We're going to kind of, you know, have the interviews overlap with each other.
[00:25:09.716 --> 00:25:12.718]  And of course, that gentleman was formerly with the CIA.
[00:25:12.978 --> 00:25:17.200]  Not just one of these analysts, but an actual field commander who himself carried out false flags.
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.882]  Now not false flags killing people, but still false flags.
[00:25:20.322 --> 00:25:23.784]  And so Robert David Steele is going to be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:25:23.824 --> 00:25:25.225]  They'll both be on together for 30 minutes.
[00:25:25.525 --> 00:25:28.086]  Then she'll leave and he'll be on with us for 30 minutes of the next hour.
[00:25:28.427 --> 00:25:34.450]  Then Rob Dew, out there covering the people attacking the Trump events, will be joining us from the ground.
[00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.512]  The video they shot last night will be in San Francisco this evening.
[00:25:38.519 --> 00:25:43.658]  The video they shot last night is all over CNN, Fox, you name it, and they crop it and don't even give us credit.
[00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:45.351]  But I don't even care.
[00:25:45.431 --> 00:25:56.502]  The point is, is that we're there to get this information out, and that's what your support, and all of you spreading the word about the broadcast, and buying the products, and InfowarsStore.com, you name it, it makes it all possible.
[00:25:56.882 --> 00:26:06.071]  So thank you so much for helping us build a true, independent, libertarian-based, nationalist, constitutionalist, pro-human organization.
[00:26:06.692 --> 00:26:08.253]  We are the anti-eugenics party.
[00:26:08.914 --> 00:26:10.695]  We are the anti-technocracy party.
[00:26:10.955 --> 00:26:11.856]  We're pro-technology.
[00:26:12.236 --> 00:26:14.197]  Anti-technotronic takeover.
[00:26:14.557 --> 00:26:18.619]  And folks, if you don't know what that is, learn quickly, because that's the real system we're going under.
[00:26:20.134 --> 00:26:23.497]  So Cynthia McKinney joins us, all things CynthiaMcKinney.com.
[00:26:23.517 --> 00:26:28.481]  She's got a couple of websites, I'm not sure which one we should give out, but Dr. McKinney, it is great to have you on with us.
[00:26:28.521 --> 00:26:42.432]  I know that you originally wanted to pop on about Beyonce, and my point is this NFL, CIA funded, that's been admitted, Pentagon funded, her message, where it looks like it's empowering, in my view, is meant to get people at each other's throats, to cause division,
[00:26:43.012 --> 00:26:44.033]  Well, thank you so much, Alex.
[00:27:06.348 --> 00:27:10.629]  I'm sorry, we've been having so many Skype problems, like we may have to start abandoning Skype in just a moment.
[00:27:10.649 --> 00:27:12.069]  Let me just stop you for a moment, Cynthia.
[00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.050]  Guys, let's get her on the phone or whatever we need to do, all right?
[00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:16.931]  We probably have to abandon Skype here.
[00:27:16.951 --> 00:27:20.752]  I don't know if it's system-wide in the country or if it's here, but it's with every person.
[00:27:21.412 --> 00:27:23.592]  Let's see if we can hear her now, and if not, we're going to get her on the phone.
[00:27:23.632 --> 00:27:24.192]  Go ahead, Cynthia.
[00:27:25.893 --> 00:27:33.815]  Okay, I'm just saying that I'm so happy that you are having me on the show, and I hope that I'm coming through now.
[00:27:35.792 --> 00:27:37.094]  Yes, you are coming through.
[00:27:37.114 --> 00:27:39.156]  I mean, I really think they're starting to mess with us.
[00:27:39.196 --> 00:27:44.641]  Roger Stone was on earlier, and when he comes on sometimes, someone jumps on his computer and is controlling the browser.
[00:27:44.661 --> 00:27:46.383]  I mean, this is really starting to happen.
[00:27:46.403 --> 00:27:49.306]  I think what we're seeing is some information warfare, but please continue.
[00:27:49.326 --> 00:27:49.827]  I apologize.
[00:27:51.621 --> 00:28:02.788]  Well, the situation with Trump and the riot that took place, let me first say, I'm not in the United States for the past two weeks.
[00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:05.950]  I've been in Africa and I've been in Asia.
[00:28:07.881 --> 00:28:16.491]  Let me tell you that people are concerned about the potential for a President Trump.
[00:28:16.971 --> 00:28:23.078]  And this stems from things that he has said or things that he has reportedly said.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:39.729]  At the same time, let me just remind folks that if you run a draw play too many times, then the defense is going to be able to tell when you're running a draw play.
[00:28:40.309 --> 00:28:42.771]  Now, this situation with the riot
[00:28:43.491 --> 00:28:44.653]  I remember.
[00:29:02.372 --> 00:29:17.130]  Homeless people were told that I was giving away money and all they had to do was come to my campaign headquarters and collect a check, collect some cash.
[00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.895]  And of course people, I mean,
[00:29:28.035 --> 00:29:30.197]  All right, we're having Skype problems with Cynthia McKinney.
[00:29:30.237 --> 00:29:33.099]  She's getting into dirty tricks, how these type of operations run.
[00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:37.543]  When her Skype comes back, we'll attempt to go to her, and then at break, we're gonna attempt to get on a phone line with her.
[00:29:37.623 --> 00:29:41.327]  She's in Bangladesh, so that may be the reason we're having some Skype problems.
[00:29:41.347 --> 00:29:43.789]  But with Roger Stone, they've been breaking into his computers.
[00:29:43.809 --> 00:29:44.930]  Of course, he's one of the top
[00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.071]  Trump advisers, so what do you expect?
[00:29:47.091 --> 00:29:50.972]  I mean, he's the frontrunner of the so-called free world, and they're really coming after him.
[00:29:51.632 --> 00:29:54.553]  And absolutely, Trump does some things I disagree with, some things that scare people.
[00:29:54.833 --> 00:29:56.754]  The media also kind of misrepresents a lot of it.
[00:29:57.054 --> 00:30:02.936]  The bigger question I want to ask Cynthia McKinney is, why does she think the system across the board is so scared of him?
[00:30:02.956 --> 00:30:04.217]  But we'll get to that question in a moment.
[00:30:04.837 --> 00:30:06.497]  Your Skype was cutting out again, Dr. McKinney.
[00:30:06.797 --> 00:30:10.619]  You were getting into, they sent the homeless, claiming that you were offering free money.
[00:30:10.659 --> 00:30:11.199]  Please continue.
[00:30:13.175 --> 00:30:17.799]  And so eventually, I was totally embarrassed.
[00:30:18.339 --> 00:30:20.541]  All of the media were there to cover it.
[00:30:22.422 --> 00:30:24.424]  And I was totally embarrassed.
[00:30:24.504 --> 00:30:27.026]  This is exactly a replay.
[00:30:27.086 --> 00:30:32.050]  This is a not so instant replay of what happened to me.
[00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.491]  So I recognize it.
[00:30:34.212 --> 00:30:39.896]  And so the objective is to make Trump so
[00:30:40.877 --> 00:30:48.164]  Unpalatable that one doesn't have any choice but to cast their vote for Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:48.925 --> 00:30:54.650]  And under no circumstance should any thinking voter vote for Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:55.506 --> 00:31:03.511]  Well, even Louis Farrakhan has been saying good things about Trump overall, compared to the other establishment candidates, even though he disagrees with some of the things.
[00:31:03.531 --> 00:31:06.313]  And of course, Trump obviously disagrees with some of the stuff Louis Farrakhan says.
[00:31:06.773 --> 00:31:10.736]  All I know is I've never seen the power structure so scared of somebody.
[00:31:10.776 --> 00:31:17.640]  What is your view, as somebody that's been inside Congress, but also been all over the world, Dr. McKinney, of why the system's so scared of Trump?
[00:31:21.102 --> 00:31:23.964]  Well, you know, his instincts.
[00:31:26.532 --> 00:31:28.753]  He said something that caught my attention.
[00:31:29.113 --> 00:31:32.495]  Of course, he said a lot of things that caught a lot of attention, right?
[00:31:32.695 --> 00:31:33.115]  Okay.
[00:31:33.855 --> 00:31:36.897]  However, he started talking about NATO.
[00:31:37.597 --> 00:31:40.999]  You and I know that NATO is an anachronism.
[00:31:41.479 --> 00:31:46.702]  NATO should have been dismantled a decade ago or more.
[00:31:47.691 --> 00:31:47.791]  The
[00:32:07.535 --> 00:32:14.221]  Keep cement together these entities that are basically drifting apart.
[00:32:14.641 --> 00:32:20.906]  If you look at what's happening in Europe today and then... Sure, he also wants peace with Russia.
[00:32:20.966 --> 00:32:22.327]  I mean, that is such a big positive.
[00:32:23.848 --> 00:32:24.389]  That's right.
[00:32:24.769 --> 00:32:29.033]  And so now you've got NATO has become a global
[00:32:30.021 --> 00:32:48.067]  Army to destabilize other parts of the world in pursuit of the Cold War against Russia and a hot war, it seems, against China.
[00:33:02.335 --> 00:33:11.519]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important area of InfoWars that runs the whole operation that is having such a big effect against the globalists.
[00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:19.983]  And I've said it over and over again, it is you the listeners and the viewers that send us the intel, the news tips, that support the broadcast, that spread the word.
[00:33:20.883 --> 00:33:23.984]  You are 90% of the operation or more.
[00:33:24.024 --> 00:33:27.166]  You don't stand beside us, you stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:07.049 --> 00:37:07.349]  F**k Trump!

[00:37:25.057 --> 00:37:26.397]  F**k Trump
[00:37:28.576 --> 00:37:29.117]  Oh please.
[00:37:29.217 --> 00:37:31.140]  Shut up!
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.124]  Shut the f*** up!
[00:37:34.164 --> 00:37:39.371]  You know what's good for your health, homie!
[00:37:39.391 --> 00:37:41.193]  Trump, free all the homies!
[00:37:41.254 --> 00:37:42.495]  F*** em off!
[00:37:42.515 --> 00:37:43.216]  Free El Chapo!
[00:37:44.037 --> 00:37:46.078]  Which means to break up this assembly.
[00:37:46.158 --> 00:37:53.159]  If you do not do so, you may be arrested for subjecting other police officers.
[00:38:07.003 --> 00:38:10.724]  Alright, what do you think is going to happen in like five minutes?
[00:38:11.364 --> 00:38:16.826]  In like five minutes, there's going to be pepper spray, and riot gear running all through here.
[00:38:16.846 --> 00:38:30.710]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly, and in the name of the people of the state of California, demand all those assembled on fair and fair views be immediately dispersed.
[00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:36.691]  Word up, like, dude, he said that us Mexicans are bringing all types of bad people to this country.
[00:38:37.191 --> 00:38:37.832]  That's incorrect.
[00:39:17.932 --> 00:39:18.132]  Yep.
[00:39:18.933 --> 00:39:23.397]  Thought I was dying out and then, uh, looks like a kettling is happening at this point.
[00:39:31.051 --> 00:39:35.972]  Oh, they've been waiting for that guy.
[00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:57.780]  Yeah, that was a guy that got a scuffle with him earlier.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:11.528]  One of the Brown Beret guys, right here.
[00:40:11.588 --> 00:40:12.409]  I know.
[00:40:13.749 --> 00:40:15.090]  There's not many people out, yeah.
[00:40:20.773 --> 00:40:23.435]  So it looks like they are picking out people to arrest at this point.
[00:40:27.385 --> 00:40:28.245]  Yeah.
[00:40:28.465 --> 00:40:29.006]  Yeah.
[00:40:29.146 --> 00:40:29.626]  Yeah.
[00:40:29.766 --> 00:40:30.646]  Yeah.
[00:40:54.522 --> 00:40:56.383]  You can't tell me that you're here to protect anybody.
[00:41:18.885 --> 00:41:30.592]  Looks like at this point they're going to start picking out people that have been causing trouble throughout the day and probably grabbing them.
[00:41:33.073 --> 00:41:38.537]  I didn't say you were, but from their point of view that's what they're picking out.
[00:41:39.013 --> 00:41:39.693]  Yeah, you're not.
[00:41:39.713 --> 00:41:42.555]  That guy earlier, that guy they just arrested got in a scuffle with the cops earlier.
[00:41:42.695 --> 00:41:44.517]  Oh, but he was talking, he didn't even swing at him.
[00:41:44.597 --> 00:41:45.937]  I didn't say he did anything now.
[00:41:46.258 --> 00:41:47.338]  Did he do anything to provoke him?
[00:41:48.279 --> 00:41:49.200]  Nah, I have it on video.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.221]  He wasn't doing anything, that was stupid.
[00:41:52.261 --> 00:41:52.642]  Sorry.
[00:41:52.662 --> 00:41:53.022]  So, anyway.
[00:41:53.082 --> 00:41:55.644]  It's interesting, now they're coming around the back.
[00:42:16.519 --> 00:42:30.367]  Like cockroaches under the cookie jar, the Obama administration is scurrying to blame anyone other than themselves for the complete failure that will go down as the fourth worst economic presidency in American history.
[00:42:30.627 --> 00:42:39.773]  Well, Michelle, I think what the President is referring to is something that he's observed before, which is that in the earliest days of his presidency, the country was facing
[00:42:41.343 --> 00:42:43.584]  Historically dire economic environment.
[00:42:44.085 --> 00:43:00.574]  The president and his team were rapidly responding to these crises and making difficult policy decisions that ultimately, here seven years later, have yielded tremendous progress.
[00:43:02.315 --> 00:43:03.156]  Oh, well.
[00:43:04.556 --> 00:43:06.898]  I hear there's some hot-sod journalists here.
[00:43:09.496 --> 00:43:13.637]  You know, Josh was speaking for me and I wanted to make sure he was getting it right.
[00:43:13.877 --> 00:43:20.639]  As his final term ends, Obama is closing in on the embarrassing distinction of being the only U.S.
[00:43:20.719 --> 00:43:27.741]  president in American history to fail to oversee even one year of 3% economic growth.
[00:43:28.001 --> 00:43:34.443]  Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit writes, On Thursday, the Commerce Department announced that the U.S.
[00:43:34.523 --> 00:43:38.244]  economy expanded at the slowest pace in two years.
[00:43:38.664 --> 00:43:39.905]  We're good to go.
[00:43:54.156 --> 00:44:06.843]  If the economy continues to perform below 2.67% GDP growth rate this year, President Barack Obama will leave office with the fourth worst economic record in U.S.
[00:44:06.863 --> 00:44:07.284]  history.
[00:44:07.544 --> 00:44:19.931]  Woodhill continues this would place his presidency fourth from the bottom of the list of 39, above only those of Herbert Hoover at negative 5.65%, Andrew Johnson at negative 0.7%, and Theodore Roosevelt
[00:44:23.613 --> 00:44:23.693]  At 1.41%.
[00:44:32.591 --> 00:44:37.994]  Furthermore, Herbert Hoover's presidency began right at the beginning of the Great Depression.
[00:44:38.294 --> 00:44:46.638]  Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's vice president, only escaped the same fate as Anastasia because his would-be assassin, George Atzerodt, got drunk.
[00:44:46.899 --> 00:44:58.705]  Johnson then proceeded to oversee the mountainous task of reconstruction in the wake of the American Civil War, and Teddy Roosevelt became president after McKinley was killed by an anarchist.
[00:44:59.025 --> 00:45:17.254]  Having survived the great depressions of the 19th century, Roosevelt then went on to endure the panic of 1907 and ensured future economic growth by waging war on corporate corruption by filing no less than 40 antitrust suits against the robber barons of the emerging 20th century.
[00:45:17.974 --> 00:45:21.055]  I am not leading this fight as a matter of aesthetic pleasure.
[00:45:21.576 --> 00:45:26.258]  I am leading because somebody must lead or else the fight would not be made at all.
[00:45:28.484 --> 00:45:45.391]  Obama simply inherited George Bush's baton of NAFTA-esque trade deals, but rather than diminishing the damage waged on the American worker, as he promised in his campaign speeches... Our trade agreements should not just be good for Wall Street, it should also be good for Main Street.
[00:45:45.751 --> 00:45:53.935]  And the problem that we've had is that we've had corporate lobbyists oftentimes involved in negotiating these trade agreements, but the AFL-CIO hasn't been involved.
[00:45:54.415 --> 00:46:07.358]  Ordinary working people have not been involved, and we've got to make sure that our agreements are good for everybody, because globalization right now is creating winners and losers, but the problem is it's the same winners and the same losers each and every time.
[00:46:07.858 --> 00:46:11.379]  There's a reason this Trans-Pacific Partnership took five years to negotiate.
[00:46:11.399 --> 00:46:16.480]  I wanted to get the best possible deal for American workers, and that is what we've done.
[00:46:17.381 --> 00:46:27.851]  Obama expanded the trade deals into sovereign killing New World Order behemoths and promoted them in secret for the globalist corporate banksters that financed his career.
[00:46:28.151 --> 00:46:37.580]  It appears a disclaimer is in order, considering the current climate branding any open-minded discussion of, well, just about anything to be racist.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:42.585]  In my humble opinion, Obama isn't the worst president in history because he is
[00:46:42.725 --> 00:46:43.386]  Good and bad.

[00:47:07.584 --> 00:47:09.785]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.905 --> 00:47:16.707]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:47:16.927 --> 00:47:20.208]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.228 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.688 --> 00:47:23.529]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.989]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.029 --> 00:47:53.013]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[00:47:55.754 --> 00:47:56.915]  And we thank you for your support.
[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.701]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:46.583]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the InfoWar.
[00:48:47.023 --> 00:48:53.688]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force, and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.

[00:48:59.152 --> 00:49:00.313]  InfoWars!
[00:49:00.413 --> 00:49:03.516]  Hey, how's it going, man?
[00:49:08.099 --> 00:49:16.746]  Alright, they're pushing down the barriers now and running over.
[00:49:20.256 --> 00:49:24.778]  Here it goes.
[00:49:24.878 --> 00:49:38.505]  Alright, they've broken open the barrier and they're going inside.
[00:49:38.665 --> 00:49:39.225]  Excuse me.
[00:49:39.385 --> 00:49:39.966]  Excuse me.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.061]  Alright, they just said they were going to be arrested.
[00:49:51.081 --> 00:49:53.263]  Got people being triggered.
[00:49:53.923 --> 00:50:01.288]  So there's a mass of people up at the front.
[00:50:01.308 --> 00:50:02.329]  There he goes.
[00:50:02.369 --> 00:50:06.311]  Looks like they're coming forward now.
[00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:19.411]  So they're at the front right now.
[00:50:19.451 --> 00:50:20.911]  You can see them.
[00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:29.656]  White supremacy's got to go!
[00:50:29.836 --> 00:50:30.356]  Hey, hey!
[00:50:30.776 --> 00:50:31.356]  Ho, ho!
[00:50:31.777 --> 00:50:33.577]  White supremacy's got to go!
[00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:34.358]  Hey, hey!
[00:50:34.718 --> 00:50:35.338]  Ho, ho!
[00:50:35.838 --> 00:50:37.579]  White supremacy's got to go!
[00:50:37.739 --> 00:50:38.200]  Hey, hey!
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:39.880]  Ho, ho!
[00:50:45.444 --> 00:50:48.025]  So they massed around there, nobody's gotten into the hotel yet.
[00:50:58.869 --> 00:51:02.890]  Police are, people are listening to the police at this point, half of them.
[00:51:16.496 --> 00:51:17.056]  Well, here it is.
[00:51:17.076 --> 00:51:36.927]  Looks like they are storming the gates at this point.
[00:51:37.507 --> 00:51:38.187]  I'm with the media.
[00:51:38.227 --> 00:51:42.410]  I don't want to get... Not a pass to get inside, but... You gotta stay here?
[00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:42.710]  Okay.
[00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:44.091]  Hey!
[00:51:47.156 --> 00:51:51.940]  If somebody pushes me into you, just don't knock me in the face.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.703]  So the cops have pushed him back now from the front entrance.
[00:52:10.728 --> 00:52:11.829]  They pushed some people down.
[00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:16.092]  They're using their, uh, bullet kits.
[00:52:17.173 --> 00:52:18.173]  They're throwing eggs now.
[00:52:18.193 --> 00:52:19.554]  I've seen a few eggs being thrown.
[00:52:20.035 --> 00:52:21.616]  People are going through the hedgerows right now.
[00:52:28.456 --> 00:52:29.137]  They're pulling back.
[00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:48.337]  Alright, they're throwing eggs and they're pushing the protesters back at this time now.
[00:52:48.417 --> 00:52:53.141]  You can see they're pushing them back into the street.
[00:53:15.578 --> 00:53:17.819]  We'll sweep you aside like the rest of you.
[00:53:17.839 --> 00:53:17.899]  Yup.
[00:53:17.919 --> 00:53:18.019]  Yup.
[00:53:18.099 --> 00:53:18.239]  Yup.
[00:53:18.299 --> 00:53:18.880]  Back up, back up.
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:19.440]  Get down, back up!
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.400]  Get down, back up!
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:20.820]  Fuck you!
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:21.921]  Get down, back up!
[00:53:21.961 --> 00:53:22.561]  Get down, back up!
[00:53:22.581 --> 00:53:23.161]  Get down, back up!
[00:53:23.181 --> 00:53:24.142]  Get down, back up!
