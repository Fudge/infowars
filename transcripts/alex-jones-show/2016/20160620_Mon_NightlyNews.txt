[00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:22.505]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:23.826]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:27.969]  It is June 20th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:38.935]  Tonight, Barack Hussein Obama continues to protect Islam while attacking Christians.
[00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:51.548]  Meanwhile, the Justice Department releases an edited transcript of the 911 call from the radical Muslim terrorists during the Pulse nightclub attack.
[00:00:51.988 --> 00:01:03.599]  Then, anti-Trump protesters migrate to Phoenix, Arizona, armed with Mexican flags and a giant inflatable Trump sporting a KKK outfit.
[00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:14.550]  Plus, the candidate running against establishment puppet John McCain says the senator is directly responsible for the rise of ISIS.
[00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.630]  I know these people.
[00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.351]  I'm in contact with them all the time.
[00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:20.953]  Joe Biggs talks to Dr. Kelly Ward.
[00:01:21.753 --> 00:01:25.375]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly.
[00:01:30.213 --> 00:01:37.699]  Buckley, tell us about Alexa Pure Breeze, discounted over 25% off as an introductory promotion.
[00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.060]  It's the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.983]  It's an energy efficient HEPA ion cluster air purification system.
[00:01:43.363 --> 00:01:45.805]  It has a four stage purification process.
[00:01:45.945 --> 00:01:49.228]  It has a HEPA filter, three filters, and a carbon activated filters.
[00:01:49.488 --> 00:01:58.971]  And the most amazing thing about it is that it has this patented ion cluster technology that kills airborne microbes with a final byproduct of clean water, not ozone.
[00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:10.674]  Because there's a lot of units out there that do that, that will sterilize the air, that will take out toxins and microbes, but you always come back into the room and you have that ozone smell, and as a matter of fact, if you leave a room sealed and you have one of those running... Toxin!
[00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:12.435]  It is toxic and it's kind of dangerous.
[00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:14.336]  So this is non-toxic.
[00:02:14.496 --> 00:02:15.577]  It's a beautiful unit.
[00:02:15.877 --> 00:02:16.717]  It really looks good.
[00:02:16.757 --> 00:02:18.679]  I mean, it will look beautiful in your house in a corner.
[00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.521]  The Alexa Pure Breeze, which operates as a fan.
[00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:23.501]  It's super quiet.
[00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:24.462]  It cleans the air.
[00:02:24.982 --> 00:02:27.624]  Every major room in your house really should have one of these.
[00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:41.113]  The cheapest equivalent unit costs $259.95 and there are other units that are up to $899 to $1,000 to do exactly what this unit does but they're not as quiet because this one has a silent mode which runs at 16 decibels.
[00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:46.636]  One thing that I encourage everybody to do is go and just look up online the toxicity of being inside all the time.
[00:02:46.876 --> 00:02:50.039]  In this current age, we're inside the vast majority of the time.
[00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.020]  Hardly do we ever get outside in the sun.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.282]  We're usually out inside doing something in our office or at home.
[00:02:55.643 --> 00:02:56.746]  Great job, Alexa Pure.
[00:02:56.946 --> 00:03:00.114]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com for all the nitroceuticals.
[00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.075]  The latest example of authoritarian censorship by the most transparent administration ever has been defeated.
[00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:18.301]  Now this morning, the FBI and the Department of Justice released a partial transcript from the 911 call made by the Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen.
[00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:31.270]  It's been our goal to get as much information into the public domain as possible so people can understand, as we do, possibly what motivated this killer, what led him to this place, and also provide us with information.
[00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.233]  Now the Attorney General said that this partial transcript was released to give people a sense of the motivation of the killer.
[00:03:38.573 --> 00:03:44.395]  But how are people supposed to know his motivation if you scrub all references to Islam and ISIS?
[00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:50.638]  This seems more in line with the Obama administration's previous efforts to protect Islam.
[00:03:51.218 --> 00:03:59.801]  Following some backlash, the FBI and the DOJ reversed course and they have now released the full transcript, which of course tells us what we already know.
[00:04:00.181 --> 00:04:00.781]  So what do you think?
[00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:09.064]  Was this a wise move by the Department of Justice to let any future jihadists know that they're not going to be receiving any accolades for committing atrocity?
[00:04:09.424 --> 00:04:13.526]  Or is this another Orwellian rewrite of history by the Ministry of Truth?
[00:04:13.846 --> 00:04:19.108]  The DOJ replaced Allah with God in the edited Orlando transcript.
[00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:28.310]  So this is very odd considering the fact that a veteran was forcibly kicked out of an Air Force ceremony for daring to mention the word God.
[00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:40.152]  School children are no longer allowed to recite One Nation under God, yet it's okay to edit God into the equation in order to suggest that a terrorist uttered these words when he did no such thing.
[00:04:40.552 --> 00:04:42.872]  He said Allah Akbar, not praise God.
[00:04:43.312 --> 00:04:46.813]  So obviously by erasing ties to Islamic extremism here,
[00:04:47.353 --> 00:05:05.066]  Anyone in the future looking back on this atrocity can recall that this was more about the nation's gun problem, or about a young man who was dealing with some of his sexual identity issues, or perhaps even the evils of Christianity, but not Islamic terrorism.
[00:05:05.646 --> 00:05:15.281]  Even the New York Times came out last week making excuses for radical Islamists by saying, hold up Christians, the Bible calls for the execution of gays too.
[00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:16.402]  It doesn't.
[00:05:16.843 --> 00:05:21.270]  But why is there such a push to demonize Christianity when the only countries currently
[00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:29.197]  Executing gays, state-sponsored execution, or just throwing them off of roofs are nations under Islamic rule.
[00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:36.403]  And also considering the fact that ISIS has just released another video threatening an attack in Times Square, as well as U.S.
[00:05:36.543 --> 00:05:48.113]  bases around the world, I don't think the administration can continue to pretend that not uttering the words radical Islamic terrorism will somehow magically make it disappear.
[00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.289]  That's a great report there from Leanne McAdoo.
[00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.810]  Now, coming up later in our show, we'll have special reports from John Bounds and others.
[00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:02.532]  But first, to focus on this report that Leanne just gave us, that is a perfect example of why I don't just recite the press release.
[00:06:02.572 --> 00:06:10.114]  Because you guys understand that when you go out to these events, whether it's a riot or anything that may be somewhat controversial,
[00:06:10.754 --> 00:06:12.575]  You have many initial reports, right?
[00:06:12.595 --> 00:06:17.418]  They'll send out the information that they have on hand at the time that information changes, which is understandable.
[00:06:17.438 --> 00:06:21.941]  You get new sources, you get new information, videos are released, and so on and so forth.
[00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:24.563]  But then comes the almighty press release.
[00:06:24.603 --> 00:06:35.350]  The press release that says that we didn't shoot tear gas at the journalists that were disassembling their equipment, and you're a conspiracy theorist if you say otherwise, and then I just happened to be there that day and had my own footage of it.
[00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.452]  And yes, they did help them disassemble their equipment.
[00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:41.514]  That's after they shot tear gas and rubber bullets at them.
[00:06:41.794 --> 00:06:45.776]  That was a very important detail that was omitted from the press release.
[00:06:45.836 --> 00:07:01.466]  And it's getting to the point now where I'm glad people caught this with this DOJ transcript and how they were editing it, not just omitting certain information, but actually changing it to the point where they will change the words Allah to God and other things like removing out
[00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:10.427]  His references to the Islamic State, that is very pertinent information that completely or could completely change the motivation of a suspect in a crime.
[00:07:10.467 --> 00:07:16.388]  For example, let's say that somebody in a liquor store got shot by somebody who walked in there with a shotgun or whatever.
[00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:30.911]  Now, a lot of people may assume that this was a liquor store robbery gone bad, but let's say the guys had some personal information, they had a personal interaction, a history, and he got shot because he did the guy something wrong or he felt wronged by the gentleman.
[00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:34.775]  That completely changes the dynamic of the liquor store shooting.
[00:07:34.876 --> 00:07:39.081]  It wasn't just a robbery, it was some type of revenge scheme or other things like that.
[00:07:39.161 --> 00:07:42.385]  And that's the same thing we see with this Orlando shooter.
[00:07:42.405 --> 00:07:47.091]  They want to remove certain aspects of it that really show his true motivations.
[00:07:48.112 --> 00:07:51.076]  To an extent, I can understand why they want to do this.
[00:07:51.116 --> 00:08:01.729]  They don't want to give any credence to these ISIS supporters, these people with this very extremist ideology that says you can go someplace and kill people if you disagree with their points of view.
[00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:13.873]  I can understand that to an extent, but at the same time, I think you are really doing the people who died there a disservice if you don't show the person's true motivations for why he did the killing in the first place.
[00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:19.175]  You know, you can see all the reports out there, they say the guy is more than likely a closet homosexual.
[00:08:19.195 --> 00:08:22.036]  Had his own views and things like that.
[00:08:22.076 --> 00:08:26.018]  He was going out to the club, not just to scout it out, but to participate in the activities.
[00:08:26.458 --> 00:08:30.500]  Also, he did say that he was doing this for ISIS, for the Islamic State.
[00:08:31.383 --> 00:08:41.371]  These are very pertinent points of view, and when you redact this, and not only redact it, but just completely change the motivation, it's a huge disservice and doesn't really get anything done.
[00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:49.437]  So I'm very glad that the DOJ decided to reverse this decision, but once again, people had to hold their feet to the fire for this to happen.
[00:08:49.777 --> 00:08:53.140]  Had people just not paid attention to it and they went on and just talked about Cleveland
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.020]  We're good to go.
[00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:25.273]  And the situation with this is, is they had a number of officers involved with a underage prostitute, thus the allegations are.
[00:09:25.293 --> 00:09:30.934]  And they say that the third police chief to be replaced in the last nine days amid the sex scandal.
[00:09:31.515 --> 00:09:34.956]  And an 18-year-old woman has alleged in multiple news media interviews
[00:09:35.376 --> 00:09:35.957]  We're good to go.
[00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.191]  We're good to go.
[00:10:08.362 --> 00:10:28.347]  You know, the blue, what's it, the blue privilege they refer to sometimes, and there are many great officers out there, but sometimes they don't want that house of cards to fall because if they take out this guy, then the next guy could fall, the next guy could fall, then they may get down to somebody else who maybe wasn't involved with a prostitution, but may have some other type of dirt on them that they don't want to get out into the public.
[00:10:28.707 --> 00:10:31.868]  And speaking of a guy who has a lot of dirt on him, this is El Chapo.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:47.776]  El Chapo is a very interesting case study, in my personal opinion, because you have a guy, Sinaloa cartel, one of the most famous cartels there is, really, even with him currently incarcerated in Juarez, Mexico.
[00:10:48.196 --> 00:10:50.138]  But you have a situation with El Chapo.
[00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:54.803]  He goes to Juarez, Mexico with his faction, and they commit a massive
[00:10:55.464 --> 00:10:55.544]  Yeah.
[00:11:11.323 --> 00:11:17.986]  Now, like I said, not all those are contributed to the cartel, but many, many, many, many of those are, and also in your gun-free zone.
[00:11:18.226 --> 00:11:21.128]  Also, not all those were committed by firearms, but many of them were.
[00:11:21.508 --> 00:11:27.250]  And now we see that the wife of El Chapo is saying that he needs more humane conditions.
[00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:30.012]  And I think this is very interesting for a guy who has committed such.
[00:11:30.492 --> 00:11:34.595]  Horrendous crimes, but they say a former beauty queen, which is his wife, and a U.S.
[00:11:34.635 --> 00:11:46.005]  citizen who lives in Mexico, spent several days in Washington where she held a meeting with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, an arm of the Organization for American States.
[00:11:46.525 --> 00:11:54.730]  They say Mexican authorities citing security concerns have moved Guzman, that's El Chapo's real name, to a prison in Juarez, Mexico near the border.
[00:11:55.130 --> 00:12:02.235]  Now thus far they're saying that his being there hasn't brought any, you know, real security concerns in that particular area.
[00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:08.198]  I understand he was moved from a different area and he's awaiting transport here to the United States pending his trial.
[00:12:08.618 --> 00:12:10.660]  But I don't know if you guys ever saw that movie Sicario.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:20.606]  Granted, it is a fictional movie, and I understand that, but many of the things portrayed in there, where they were killing journalists, hanging them from the rafters, having shootouts in the street, that stuff rarely happens.
[00:12:20.646 --> 00:12:27.831]  Now, you could say it was glamorized, sensationalized for the movie, but once again, when you look back at 2010, you see that they murdered 3,000 people there in that city.
[00:12:27.851 --> 00:12:40.740]  I don't think they had to sensationalize it too much, and quite honestly, I think the world's a little better off with El Chapo behind bars, but at the same time, you have to understand, El Chapo is a guy who was being supported, funded, armed,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.961]  By, among others, the United States government.
[00:12:44.001 --> 00:12:53.345]  We've seen the reports, the CBS News reports saying that when they went to his bunker, his lair, whatever it was, they found rifles that he had received from Operation Fast and Furious.
[00:12:53.645 --> 00:13:02.909]  They were running guns into Mexico with the notion that they were going to track these guns and when they find them at, you know, crime scenes, they would arrest the bad guy who had them.
[00:13:03.229 --> 00:13:04.891]  I said, that makes absolutely no sense at all.
[00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:13.342]  So you're just gonna let this guy run wild with the AK-47 or the AR-15 or whatever it is you're trying to demonize this week until you eventually catch up with him.
[00:13:13.382 --> 00:13:14.423]  And they said, yeah.
[00:13:15.204 --> 00:13:16.806]  Lenny Brewer stepped down.
[00:13:16.826 --> 00:13:18.248]  Eric Holder stepped down.
[00:13:19.029 --> 00:13:21.893]  Thus far as I know, no big people went to jail.
[00:13:22.433 --> 00:13:23.215]  Over that scandal.
[00:13:23.275 --> 00:13:26.440]  Like the two I just mentioned there, they're able to walk away on their own terms.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.264]  They wouldn't start a private practice with Brewer.
[00:13:29.284 --> 00:13:32.149]  I'm not sure what Holder is doing, but he's not in jail.
[00:13:32.209 --> 00:13:34.192]  We know that for a bare minimum.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:44.005]  And as we're talking about firearms after Orlando, a lot of people want to jump on the gun control bandwagon, but a group that are rejecting this is the Special Forces.
[00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:49.588]  It says Special Forces Association rejects calls for gun control from Petraeus and McChrystal.
[00:13:50.008 --> 00:13:54.951]  Those of you who don't know, Petraeus and McChrystal said that we need to tighten down on gun control legislation.
[00:13:55.611 --> 00:14:01.494]  And the issue with this is the people in the Special Forces, they realize that the Second Amendment is not a
[00:14:02.515 --> 00:14:07.376]  Restriction on the individual, the Bill of Rights in general are restrictions on the government.
[00:14:07.836 --> 00:14:20.418]  You as the private individual, I understand you have state and local laws that you have to abide by, and you can fight those if you want to, but just in general you have to abide by your state and local laws unless you live someplace like Vermont where they have complete constitutional carry.
[00:14:20.438 --> 00:14:23.059]  I believe it's Vermont, I'm going off the top of my head.
[00:14:23.479 --> 00:14:28.320]  So, and that concludes to whether you carry your rifle, your pistol, you can carry it open or concealed.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:36.523]  Whatever else, but the people of special forces, they understand that you need to have the means to protect yourself because there's not always going to be somebody to protect you all the time.
[00:14:36.844 --> 00:14:42.486]  And let's say you do call the police and the police show up and they have the best of intentions, but you also have the situation.
[00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:44.047]  It was the Empire State shooting.
[00:14:45.047 --> 00:14:55.053]  A few years back, where the officers in a scene straight out of Pulp Fiction, they pull out their guns, they open fire on the single assailant, if I'm remembering correctly.
[00:14:55.293 --> 00:14:57.674]  They hit nine other people that are not their intended target.
[00:14:58.054 --> 00:15:00.856]  I mean, this is the type of police response you want.
[00:15:01.456 --> 00:15:02.777]  You're better off not calling the police.
[00:15:03.137 --> 00:15:06.719]  Because people have this notion that the cops are always a better shot than the civilians.
[00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:09.401]  If you go to some of these shooting ranges and you watch some of these
[00:15:09.761 --> 00:15:10.241]  We're good to go.
[00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:10.782]  We're good to go.
[00:15:10.802 --> 00:15:11.222]  We're good to go.
[00:15:11.242 --> 00:15:11.762]  We're good to go.
[00:15:11.802 --> 00:15:12.943]  We're good to go.
[00:15:12.963 --> 00:15:13.883]  We're good to go.
[00:15:13.903 --> 00:15:14.563]  We're good to go.
[00:15:14.604 --> 00:15:15.384]  We're good to go.
[00:15:15.444 --> 00:15:16.204]  We're good to go.
[00:15:16.224 --> 00:15:16.765]  We're good to go.
[00:15:16.785 --> 00:15:17.685]  We're good to go.
[00:15:17.705 --> 00:15:18.465]  We're good to go.
[00:15:18.506 --> 00:15:19.406]  We're good to go.
[00:15:19.426 --> 00:15:20.106]  We're good to go.
[00:15:20.146 --> 00:15:21.767]  We're good to go.
[00:15:21.807 --> 00:15:22.788]  We're good to go.
[00:15:22.848 --> 00:15:23.428]  We're good to go.
[00:15:23.448 --> 00:15:24.068]  We're good to go.
[00:15:24.108 --> 00:15:24.709]  We're good to go.
[00:15:24.729 --> 00:15:25.149]  We're good to go.
[00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:26.169]  We're good to go.
[00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:26.790]  We're good to go.
[00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:27.670]  We're good to go.
[00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.531]  We're good to go.
[00:15:28.571 --> 00:15:29.371]  We're good to go.
[00:15:29.671 --> 00:15:30.131]  We're good to go.
[00:15:30.151 --> 00:15:31.212]  We're good to go.
[00:15:31.252 --> 00:15:32.052]  We're good to go.
[00:15:32.713 --> 00:15:33.193]  We're good to go.
[00:15:33.213 --> 00:15:33.653]  We're good to go.
[00:15:33.673 --> 00:15:34.013]  We're good to go.
[00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:34.434]  We're good to go.
[00:15:34.454 --> 00:15:34.934]  We're good to go.
[00:15:34.954 --> 00:15:35.314]  We're good to go.
[00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:36.135]  We're good to go.
[00:15:36.155 --> 00:15:36.515]  We're good to go.
[00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:36.895]  We're good to go.
[00:15:36.915 --> 00:15:37.035]  We're
[00:15:39.256 --> 00:15:42.537]  Senator John McCain is directly responsible for the rise of ISIS.
[00:15:42.917 --> 00:15:45.198]  These are the words of Dr. Kelly Ward.
[00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:48.578]  She had a chance to speak to Joe Biggs, and that's what she had to say.
[00:15:48.918 --> 00:15:51.179]  And I definitely think that John McCain should be held accountable.
[00:15:51.219 --> 00:15:52.099]  He's going over there.
[00:15:52.379 --> 00:15:54.440]  He's talking to these guys like, I know who these guys are.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.540]  I have no issue with them.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.761]  And meanwhile, he's giving them the weapons and all the things they need to succeed.
[00:15:59.061 --> 00:16:02.982]  So here's this video, and we'll come back after this break with more special reports.
[00:16:04.568 --> 00:16:06.248]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:16:06.268 --> 00:16:10.790]  Now we're inside the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix, Arizona, and I'm joined by Kelly Ward.
[00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.310]  So, how are you doing today?
[00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.210]  I'm doing great.
[00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.831]  I'm glad to be here with all of these great Americans who want to make America great again.
[00:16:17.171 --> 00:16:20.272]  And I'm glad to see someone challenge Senator John McCain.
[00:16:20.292 --> 00:16:21.312]  That's really making me happy.
[00:16:21.372 --> 00:16:27.934]  So, tell me a little bit about your platform and then about the remarks about how you believe he's kind of responsible for the rise of ISIS.
[00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.875]  Yes, well, you know, I'm running on a small government platform.
[00:16:31.375 --> 00:16:38.718]  Less taxes, less regulations, the strongest defense in the world, the strongest military, personal responsibility, and following the Constitution.
[00:16:38.758 --> 00:16:41.499]  I don't think you can go wrong with that kind of a platform.
[00:16:41.939 --> 00:16:44.200]  And yes, I took a punch at John McCain.
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.321]  Now, he took a punch at the President, right?
[00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:47.581]  Well, kind of.
[00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:51.783]  But he punched and then he ran backwards and said, oh, no, no, I'm sorry, I misspoke.
[00:16:52.963 --> 00:16:59.770]  I will tell you that John McCain is directly responsible for the rise of ISIS.
[00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.371]  I'm not misspeaking.
[00:17:01.752 --> 00:17:02.773]  I'm telling you the truth.
[00:17:03.834 --> 00:17:15.365]  His policies that he has had in place have allowed for a vacuum to be created in the Middle East that has been filled by a radical, jihadi, Islamic terror element.
[00:17:15.885 --> 00:17:22.790]  Now, the thing that's most concerning for me here on our soil is that John McCain has also supported amnesty and open borders.
[00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:33.396]  And so, we have left a pathway, a wide pathway, open for those emboldened elements to come right into our country and affect our country, our soil, and our citizens.
[00:17:33.496 --> 00:17:34.277]  It's unacceptable.
[00:17:34.717 --> 00:17:38.661]  We have a commander-in-chief now that can't even say radical Islam.
[00:17:38.862 --> 00:17:41.444]  And then he goes on the news and tells people not to use it.
[00:17:41.985 --> 00:17:45.048]  In essence, giving them a free pass to continue what they're doing.
[00:17:45.429 --> 00:17:46.790]  You know, I was just in Orlando.
[00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.292]  I saw all that stuff out there.
[00:17:48.472 --> 00:17:49.112]  Ridiculous.
[00:17:49.553 --> 00:17:52.216]  And like you said, they're allowing the border to be wide open.
[00:17:52.556 --> 00:17:53.457]  What are you going to propose?
[00:17:53.477 --> 00:17:55.019]  What are you going to help to do to secure borders?
[00:17:55.299 --> 00:17:57.541]  Well I'm ready to mix the mortar to fix the border!
[00:17:57.561 --> 00:18:01.606]  And so I'm here today because Donald Trump does want to secure the border.
[00:18:01.646 --> 00:18:03.348]  He does want to stop illegal immigration.
[00:18:03.688 --> 00:18:08.393]  He does want to prioritize Americans, American citizens, over people who come here illegally.
[00:18:08.734 --> 00:18:13.739]  He does want to stop, stop people from coming into this country who want to do us harm.
[00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:15.941]  And I'm all for all of those things.
[00:18:16.809 --> 00:18:20.534]  I mean, we already have a border fence in Hereford, Arizona and those areas.
[00:18:20.614 --> 00:18:22.877]  I actually go up and down through the border quite a bit.
[00:18:23.357 --> 00:18:25.200]  And you know, these guys are very resilient.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:30.026]  I mean, they use plasma cutters, cut parts of the fence, go through it and go back and weld them.
[00:18:30.446 --> 00:18:32.389]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:18:32.429 --> 00:18:33.069]  We need to secure it.
[00:18:33.089 --> 00:18:35.432]  If they're willing to do that much to get through,
[00:18:36.434 --> 00:18:39.317]  Just imagine how easy it is in so many areas to get through.
[00:18:39.357 --> 00:18:40.458]  So we definitely need to secure it.
[00:18:40.758 --> 00:18:43.160]  I'm glad that we were able to talk, you know, a chance.
[00:18:43.561 --> 00:18:45.322]  And I guess Donald Trump's about to go out.
[00:18:45.362 --> 00:18:46.123]  So have a good one.
[00:18:46.283 --> 00:18:46.503]  Thank you.
[00:19:04.906 --> 00:19:09.309]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.091]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.773 --> 00:19:15.774]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:53.820]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2, Survival Shield, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.523]  Again, that's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:23:03.855 --> 00:23:05.316]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:23:05.336 --> 00:23:15.742]  Now we're walking down the road and as you can see, they have taken a blow-up Donald Trump doll, or a blow-up Donald Trump balloon thing, put him in a KKK outfit.
[00:23:15.922 --> 00:23:17.764]  This is at 15th Avenue in Vernon.
[00:23:17.784 --> 00:23:24.988]  It says, Make America Hate Again, Trump.
[00:23:26.289 --> 00:23:29.671]  And then you got some dumbass over here that says, Make America Mexico Again.
[00:23:52.446 --> 00:23:54.548]  So why do you want to make America Mexico again?
[00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:57.650]  It's what?
[00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:06.577]  How is it anti?
[00:24:08.198 --> 00:24:08.678]  Yeah, how?
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.742]  No, you said that the criminals were coming over, which is a fact.
[00:24:14.378 --> 00:24:14.658]  Is it?
[00:24:15.499 --> 00:24:16.399]  Some have come over, yes.
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.841]  I mean, it's not our fault if you take it the wrong way.
[00:24:19.881 --> 00:24:23.042]  If you think that you're a criminal, he said that some are coming over that are criminal.
[00:24:25.347 --> 00:24:31.469]  As a politician, you obviously don't stereotype a whole community of people, a whole demographic of people as a certain way.
[00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:35.330]  You should know that clearly affects the way those people are viewed and that affects those people personally.
[00:24:35.551 --> 00:24:41.853]  Okay, well I feel affected when the government comes out and says that I should be demonized because one guy went in with a gun and killed a whole bunch of people.
[00:24:42.253 --> 00:24:44.714]  So why should I be put into that category?
[00:24:44.754 --> 00:24:47.515]  Why should I be looked at as a bad person because I like guns?
[00:24:47.615 --> 00:24:47.895]  Are you?
[00:24:47.995 --> 00:24:49.655]  Does media do that to you as a white male?
[00:24:50.156 --> 00:24:50.496]  Of course.
[00:24:50.596 --> 00:24:51.676]  Oh, I'm the white man thing?
[00:24:52.876 --> 00:24:53.497]  Oh, you are, aren't you?
[00:24:55.128 --> 00:24:55.688]  You got good eyes.
[00:24:55.708 --> 00:24:57.170]  Thanks.
[00:24:59.151 --> 00:25:00.052]  So why are you guys out here today?
[00:25:00.372 --> 00:25:00.973]  Why are we out here?
[00:25:00.993 --> 00:25:04.916]  Because we don't support Donald Trump or his racist rhetoric and we don't want that in our country.
[00:25:05.396 --> 00:25:06.717]  Have you ever talked to him before or met him?
[00:25:06.998 --> 00:25:08.879]  Or did you just watch that on MSNBC and hear that?
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.500]  I've seen the way he speaks.
[00:25:10.541 --> 00:25:11.521]  I've seen his interviews.
[00:25:12.742 --> 00:25:17.686]  I think that reflects the way he thinks of his policy.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.462]  So what do you think about his temporary ban on Muslims?
[00:25:22.642 --> 00:25:23.723]  Temporary ban on Muslims?
[00:25:24.083 --> 00:25:29.227]  I think it's very reminiscent of Hitler's policy towards Jews back in the day.
[00:25:29.347 --> 00:25:30.648]  How many Jews has Trump killed?
[00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:32.049]  Zero.
[00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:34.111]  So why is he compared to Hitler then?
[00:25:34.912 --> 00:25:38.094]  How many Jews did Hitler kill before that rhetoric?
[00:25:41.016 --> 00:25:45.100]  But you're already demonizing him and he's done nothing.
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.861]  You don't want to be demonized for something you didn't do.
[00:25:47.121 --> 00:25:48.022]  You said you're not a criminal.
[00:25:50.552 --> 00:25:51.473]  Why would you do that to him?
[00:25:52.534 --> 00:25:57.318]  Because I haven't personally attacked or gone after a certain group of people.
[00:25:57.359 --> 00:25:58.099]  So neither has he.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.201]  I believe that he has through his policy.
[00:26:01.803 --> 00:26:02.844]  Has it happened yet?
[00:26:02.924 --> 00:26:03.524]  Is that happening?
[00:26:03.664 --> 00:26:04.665]  He's proposing it.
[00:26:05.286 --> 00:26:05.926]  It's in his policy.
[00:26:05.946 --> 00:26:07.347]  But that's the good thing about the U.S.
[00:26:07.427 --> 00:26:07.908]  government.
[00:26:07.968 --> 00:26:09.349]  They have to go through Congress and all that.
[00:26:09.369 --> 00:26:10.590]  Do you think those people are going to let that happen?
[00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:12.131]  I mean, let's be realistic here.
[00:26:12.331 --> 00:26:15.574]  So should we just waste our time while this goes filibustering through Congress?
[00:26:16.034 --> 00:26:21.478]  How would the face of America be if Donald Trump is proposing we have temporary bans on Congress?
[00:26:21.518 --> 00:26:24.180]  That's such a bad face, even if it would be stopped in Congress.
[00:26:24.901 --> 00:26:25.621]  Do you understand that?
[00:26:26.022 --> 00:26:29.964]  Oh, I understand what I'm saying, but it's just like Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
[00:26:29.984 --> 00:26:40.269]  It's whatever you want to call it, but regardless... No, you don't know what... You're just comparing it to socialism, but democratic socialism is different.
[00:26:40.629 --> 00:26:42.050]  It's been done in this country, and it worked.
[00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.231]  It pulled us out of the repression while FDR was the president.
[00:26:44.792 --> 00:26:45.992]  Okay, so why are you here today?
[00:26:46.513 --> 00:26:52.436]  I'm here because we want to send a message to Trump that his ideas do not reflect a lot of ours in Phoenix.
[00:26:52.998 --> 00:26:59.161]  So do you support violence outside Trump rallies, spitting on other protesters because you have a different point of view than them?
[00:26:59.482 --> 00:27:01.122]  Absolutely not, and we are not.
[00:27:01.202 --> 00:27:02.363]  We want to keep this peaceful.
[00:27:02.403 --> 00:27:07.646]  We've seen different rallies, such as those where they're blocking highways, and we are not standing for that today.
[00:27:07.906 --> 00:27:11.048]  We want to send a peaceful message, like her says, that loves Trump's hate.
[00:27:11.508 --> 00:27:12.368]  Alright, and I appreciate it.
[00:27:12.388 --> 00:27:12.909]  That's awesome.
[00:27:13.329 --> 00:27:16.390]  That's the worst thing you can possibly do is when I hear people come out and protest.
[00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.330]  I don't care if people protest.
[00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:23.252]  What I don't like is when someone goes to a protest and they spit on people and throw eggs at them like they did in San Jose.
[00:27:23.552 --> 00:27:24.713]  So, cool.
[00:27:24.773 --> 00:27:25.213]  Well, thank you.
[00:27:26.614 --> 00:27:27.254]  Keep it that way.
[00:27:27.274 --> 00:27:27.814]  That's awesome.
[00:27:28.154 --> 00:27:28.374]  Thanks.
[00:27:29.435 --> 00:27:29.995]  Have a good one, guys.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.641]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:27:36.681 --> 00:27:42.005]  Now we're at the anti-Trump rally right down the road from where Donald Trump will be speaking later on this afternoon.
[00:27:42.025 --> 00:27:42.846]  What's your name, sir?
[00:27:42.866 --> 00:27:43.426]  Rene.
[00:27:44.848 --> 00:27:45.688]  And why are you here today?
[00:27:46.309 --> 00:28:00.619]  I'm just here to give my support to this community, you know, giving back, showing that, you know, that we're not going to let ourselves get taken over by somebody that doesn't have so much hate against us and that it's always looking
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:08.064]  To blame somebody instead of themselves and showing other ways to to show how to care about people.
[00:28:08.264 --> 00:28:10.045]  So do you live here in this in America?
[00:28:10.305 --> 00:28:10.685]  Yes, I do.
[00:28:11.125 --> 00:28:12.546]  So why not have the American flag?
[00:28:13.307 --> 00:28:15.768]  Because my parents were also here illegally.
[00:28:16.508 --> 00:28:18.389]  And, you know, I'm supporting them.
[00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.872]  They brought me they brought us, you know, came from Mexico to give a better life.
[00:28:23.092 --> 00:28:25.394]  But I mean, they left for a reason, because it's bad, right?
[00:28:26.194 --> 00:28:26.875]  Yes, they did.
[00:28:27.675 --> 00:28:42.026]  But my thing is, and that's why it looks bad for a lot of demonstrators when I go to all these rallies, when people wave Mexican flags and not the American flag, if Mexico was good, then people would stay, but people come here because it's a better life for their family, you know?
[00:28:42.486 --> 00:28:52.194]  So, don't you think your message would get by a lot better if you actually had the American flag to show that you are with America, but you have Mexican roots, you know?
[00:28:52.814 --> 00:28:54.457]  I'm more Mexican than American.
[00:28:54.977 --> 00:28:58.503]  I'm more Mexican because... So is your allegiance to Mexico or to America?
[00:28:58.523 --> 00:28:59.704]  Both.
[00:29:00.125 --> 00:29:01.567]  Because I have both nationalities.
[00:29:02.188 --> 00:29:04.651]  I have Mexican nationality and Mexican nationality.
[00:29:04.671 --> 00:29:07.375]  Because I mean I have a lot of buddies that came from Mexico, joined the U.S.
[00:29:07.456 --> 00:29:08.978]  Army, fought in combat.
[00:29:10.424 --> 00:29:14.965]  Yeah, but they got their American citizenship and they would never be called dead.
[00:29:14.985 --> 00:29:16.606]  They only would have an American flag.
[00:29:16.626 --> 00:29:17.766]  I'll just put this for example.
[00:29:17.786 --> 00:29:21.347]  At soccer games, at events, how come we don't do the national anthem?
[00:29:21.747 --> 00:29:25.328]  How come we just do the countries that whoever they're playing?
[00:29:25.348 --> 00:29:30.269]  How come we don't do the national anthem after all three teams have done it?
[00:29:31.049 --> 00:29:31.230]  Why?
[00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:32.330]  I'm asking you.
[00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.751]  Oh, I don't watch sports, so I don't know.
[00:29:34.652 --> 00:29:35.292]  Then there we go.
[00:29:35.393 --> 00:29:37.554]  So, because... Because I don't believe in sports.
[00:29:37.594 --> 00:29:39.936]  I think there's more important things to care about in the world.
[00:29:39.976 --> 00:29:52.385]  Like, if people are more concerned about racism, turn off the soccer game, turn off the football games, turn off the basketball games, and actually get out on the streets and do something about it in a peaceful way and bring attention to it instead of glorifying people that really don't care about you.
[00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:58.461]  I just, like I said, just my way of showing, you know, people that are here illegally, they can't come out here as well.
[00:29:59.181 --> 00:30:05.163]  Maybe showing the Mexican flag means that makes them want to, you know, well at least there's somebody out there that's speaking for us.
[00:30:05.323 --> 00:30:07.524]  That we're under the shadows, that they can't talk for us.
[00:30:08.164 --> 00:30:14.806]  You know, because they're afraid of coming out here and getting harassed or arrested or whatever because... Who are they going to be harassed by?
[00:30:15.086 --> 00:30:16.827]  Just by anybody.
[00:30:17.047 --> 00:30:20.348]  Just because they don't know how to defend themselves in, you know, talking in English.
[00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:22.650]  They only know in Spanish.
[00:30:23.651 --> 00:30:29.752]  So do you support this kind of rally or do you support the violent rallies that you see outside?
[00:30:30.472 --> 00:30:31.232]  No, just peaceable.
[00:30:31.532 --> 00:30:34.133]  I think it's better because that's what we're here to do.
[00:30:34.533 --> 00:30:41.335]  We're not here to go do violence and stuff like that because if we do violence then the world will be full of violence.
[00:30:41.355 --> 00:30:45.176]  Like what we saw in San Jose, California, Albuquerque, all those different places.
[00:30:46.036 --> 00:30:52.399]  When someone wants to go see a presidential candidate, regardless if you agree with them or not, Americans have the right to go see that person speak, you know?
[00:30:52.419 --> 00:30:52.779]  Do you agree?
[00:30:53.059 --> 00:30:54.580]  Correct, I do.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:31:06.546]  And I mean, my thing is, you know, I get upset when I witness this stuff, when people go out to these rallies and are being spit on, cursed at, called racist, because they want to go see this guy talk.
[00:31:06.826 --> 00:31:09.307]  A lot of them aren't even for him, they're just curious to see what he has to say.
[00:31:09.327 --> 00:31:15.050]  They've never seen him in person, but they get spit on, demonized, and that looks bad when I see protesting like that, you know?
[00:31:16.094 --> 00:31:17.234]  Don't they cause it to themselves?
[00:31:17.434 --> 00:31:19.595]  They wear Donald Trump shirts and they're just going to go out?
[00:31:19.615 --> 00:31:20.575]  Yeah, but that's freedom of speech.
[00:31:21.355 --> 00:31:21.735]  Exactly.
[00:31:21.955 --> 00:31:26.876]  You can wear Stop Hate Trump or I saw a guy in Dallas yesterday that had a Shoot Trump.
[00:31:27.236 --> 00:31:30.157]  You know, that's his freedom of speech, but you're inciting violence.
[00:31:30.777 --> 00:31:34.078]  Yeah, but are you going to go see him for the first time and wear a Donald Trump shirt?
[00:31:34.098 --> 00:31:37.178]  Or are you going to go just as a civilian just to hear what he has to say?
[00:31:37.198 --> 00:31:41.199]  Well, I didn't say every single person there was their first time, but I mean... No, I'm just talking about in general.
[00:31:41.319 --> 00:31:44.020]  Okay, but I see Bernie Sanders people go to rallies with Bernie shirts on.
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:44.560]  Why are they not?
[00:31:45.336 --> 00:31:45.956]  He's a socialist.
[00:31:46.317 --> 00:31:47.337]  Look at what's happening in Venezuela.
[00:31:48.018 --> 00:31:52.441]  Yeah, it's going to, but I mean, what, what can you do?
[00:31:52.481 --> 00:31:54.142]  At least, at least we're not here to cause.
[00:31:54.182 --> 00:31:54.803]  Yeah, I know.
[00:31:54.843 --> 00:32:08.012]  But my thing is though, is if we're going to have freedom of speech in America, everyone should have the right to wear a Donald Trump shirt, whatever you have the right to have a Mexican flag on, you know, but the same time it should be your allegiance, but always should be with America because that's where you live.
[00:32:08.032 --> 00:32:11.234]  That's where you're able to have a job where if you have kids to raise them up,
[00:32:11.374 --> 00:32:22.102]  Like I told you, I did it because there's a bunch of people out there that can't come to these rallies because they're afraid, live under the shadow, scare a door a pile, just by even going down the street to go get groceries.
[00:32:22.962 --> 00:32:23.863]  Why not support them?
[00:32:24.503 --> 00:32:25.724]  Why not have them in our back?
[00:32:26.565 --> 00:32:32.989]  If we can do it, you know, and have a voice because we're citizens here, why not support the people that are living under the shadows?
[00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:33.990]  Okay, thanks.
[00:32:40.154 --> 00:32:46.839]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.261]  You better believe you got one!
[00:33:02.352 --> 00:33:04.734]  A lot of people ask me, what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:07.247 --> 00:37:08.908]  Why would you support a racist?
[00:37:08.948 --> 00:37:13.031]  He's gonna send you back to Africa, that's what he said.
[00:37:13.511 --> 00:37:16.753]  He said send Mexicans back to Mexico.
[00:37:17.193 --> 00:37:22.917]  You are a disgrace to America for being a young black man supporting a racist.
[00:37:23.037 --> 00:37:23.437]  Thank you.
[00:37:23.597 --> 00:37:24.718]  Donald Trump, what's his name?
[00:37:24.738 --> 00:37:25.519]  I think he's a racist.
[00:37:25.559 --> 00:37:27.180]  Come on, tell us why you think Trump's a racist.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.902]  We want to talk about the details, man.
[00:37:30.922 --> 00:37:31.042]  Yeah.
[00:37:31.142 --> 00:37:32.423]  What about the facts?
[00:37:33.423 --> 00:37:36.605]  How come you guys can only say he's a racist, but y'all can't talk about the facts?
[00:37:36.905 --> 00:37:37.506]  Why is that?
[00:37:37.746 --> 00:37:41.708]  His opponents say that this is more proof that he's racist.
[00:37:42.148 --> 00:37:44.190]  And, you know, people say, is this racism?
[00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:47.131]  It sounds to me like you want to bring back the one-drop rule.
[00:37:47.292 --> 00:37:48.873]  Yeah.
[00:37:49.453 --> 00:37:51.774]  No, he said that the criminals were coming over, which is a fact.
[00:37:52.355 --> 00:37:52.655]  Is it?
[00:37:53.495 --> 00:37:54.336]  Some have come over, yes.
[00:37:55.885 --> 00:37:58.349]  So why should I be put into that category?
[00:37:58.389 --> 00:38:01.133]  Why should I be looked at as a bad person because I like guns?
[00:38:01.253 --> 00:38:01.513]  Are you?
[00:38:01.613 --> 00:38:03.296]  Does media do that to you as a white male?
[00:38:03.797 --> 00:38:04.137]  Of course.
[00:38:04.277 --> 00:38:05.319]  Oh, I'm the white man thing?
[00:38:06.501 --> 00:38:07.162]  Oh, you are, aren't you?
[00:38:07.182 --> 00:38:07.923]  Yeah.
[00:38:09.821 --> 00:38:13.162]  Does anyone on the left actually care about racism?
[00:38:13.543 --> 00:38:22.548]  Or is it just being used as a Selinski-esque tool to polarize the sheep into bleeding what they have been told is true?
[00:38:22.768 --> 00:38:27.911]  Because according to Dolly Kyle, the former high school girlfriend of Bill Clinton,
[00:38:28.391 --> 00:38:34.332]  Bill and Hillary Clinton regularly use racial epithets and look down on poor people.
[00:38:34.732 --> 00:38:38.733]  Kyle makes the accusation in her book, Hillary, The Other Woman.
[00:38:39.173 --> 00:38:49.916]  In addition to calling mentally disabled children at a governor's mansion Easter egg hunt effing retards, Kyle says Hillary referred to the people of Arkansas as ignorant hillbillies.
[00:38:50.316 --> 00:38:56.301]  Hillary also allegedly used derogatory terms for Jews, including effing Jew bastard.
[00:38:56.581 --> 00:39:01.805]  Bill, Kyle insists, called the Reverend Jesse Jackson a GDN word.
[00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:05.228]  Latinos were similarly slandered and profiled.
[00:39:05.548 --> 00:39:12.254]  Kyle continues, for no good reason, Bill and Hillary decided to profile Hispanics as drug dealers.
[00:39:12.754 --> 00:39:21.156]  Specifically, Arkansas troopers were to stop and search cars driven by Hispanics, especially those cars with Texas license plates.
[00:39:21.596 --> 00:39:25.837]  Clinton's criminal apprehension program was ruled unconstitutional.
[00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:38.480]  Kyle continues, Billy threw one of his infamous temper tantrums about the ban on his racial profiling of Hispanics, and he threatened to renew the racial profiling program in spite of the court's ruling.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:39.840]  The Daily Beast notes,
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:54.781]  Clinton's Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, authored by then-Senator Joe Biden, was supported by virtually every Democrat in Congress, including then-Representative Bernie Sanders.
[00:39:55.302 --> 00:39:59.424]  That legislation led to the mass incarceration of black Americans.
[00:39:59.784 --> 00:40:10.130]  Legal scholar Michelle Alexander notes, Bill Clinton presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history.
[00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:17.994]  Alexander accused the Clintons of decimating black America and said Hillary does not deserve the black vote.
[00:40:18.375 --> 00:40:24.478]  In response to pressure by Black Lives Matter, Hillary apologized for her role in pushing for the bill.
[00:40:24.918 --> 00:40:33.126]  Despite Hillary's alleged racism, a large number of blacks, especially in the South, turned out to vote for Clinton during the primaries.
[00:40:33.387 --> 00:40:40.454]  The Huffington Post notes, Both Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have traditionally had solid support from blacks.
[00:40:40.774 --> 00:40:43.376]  A key component of the Democratic electorate.
[00:40:43.597 --> 00:40:49.562]  In May, a Fox News poll revealed 62% of Latino voters favored Clinton over rival Donald Trump.
[00:40:49.822 --> 00:40:59.631]  Evelyn Perez Badia, analyst with Political Passion, told Fox News Latino, there's a more hospitable tone that Hillary Clinton is taking in terms of communicating with Hispanics.
[00:40:59.891 --> 00:41:02.974]  Compared to Donald Trump, it's a much different message.
[00:41:03.334 --> 00:41:05.696]  Simply because it's a fabrication.
[00:41:06.076 --> 00:41:07.558]  Snap out of it, fake liberals.
[00:41:07.778 --> 00:41:18.486]  The giant boulder of truth just crushed those little plastic lies painstakingly set up to misinform in the name of George Soros and his New World Order stooges.
[00:41:18.807 --> 00:41:24.191]  There's a real good reason why Hillary Clinton respected former Senator Robert Byrd.
[00:41:24.671 --> 00:41:29.215]  Byrd, also known as an exalted cyclops of the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:41:29.535 --> 00:41:31.697]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:41:49.286 --> 00:41:53.990]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com at the back of the Taschenberg Palais Hotel.
[00:41:54.070 --> 00:42:00.015]  There's an ambulance, I guess, waiting for if Henry Kissinger has a fall or something, or drowns in his tub.
[00:42:00.856 --> 00:42:01.296]  Who knows?
[00:42:01.917 --> 00:42:05.480]  But anyway, we've got Alex from InfoKrieg, a long-time listener.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:10.725]  InfoKrieg means InfoWars in German, and he's got InfoKrieg.com and InfoKrieg.de as well?
[00:42:11.205 --> 00:42:16.530]  It's InfoKrieg.tv, it's Recenter.com, and you can find us on the web pretty easily.
[00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:28.169]  Alright, so one of the things we're talking about in here is this new Precariat class, which is, I guess, one step away from absolute peasantry or something, absolute serfdom.
[00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:29.652]  So tell us a little bit about that.
[00:42:30.635 --> 00:42:38.001]  According to recent numbers, 17% of all European working age people, 17% are without a job.
[00:42:38.041 --> 00:42:41.483]  And of course you know the American numbers, 100 million Americans without a job.
[00:42:42.224 --> 00:42:50.170]  There used to be a lot of talk about the proletariat, the working class, not making much money but at least having a stable job or a stable work environment.
[00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:53.872]  But of course these guys, they moved a lot of the production overseas
[00:42:54.793 --> 00:43:01.116]  Well, some of these insider companies, they did not have to move overseas because it's oil business and banking stuff that stayed here.
[00:43:01.857 --> 00:43:12.482]  So obviously a lot of jobs are gone and they're talking about this new low class and what to do with them because at some point they might get smart, they might get organized or whatever.
[00:43:12.582 --> 00:43:15.364]  So their idea is the basic
[00:43:16.204 --> 00:43:17.385]  Unconditional income.
[00:43:17.725 --> 00:43:20.267]  The Swiss people just voted it down.
[00:43:20.807 --> 00:43:27.892]  It was a big vote a few days ago and it was about revamping, completely changing the social security or social system.
[00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:30.474]  Yeah, giving each person like 2,000, 2,500 Swiss francs a month.
[00:43:30.534 --> 00:43:31.494]  Is that what you're talking about?
[00:43:32.506 --> 00:43:39.431]  Well, it's different in each country when it's proposed, but I think it was that high in Switzerland.
[00:43:39.491 --> 00:43:41.753]  But of course, living costs are higher in Switzerland.
[00:43:41.813 --> 00:43:47.737]  Other countries have said it would be more like 800 Euros, and it could be 800 Euros to 1,000 Euros in Germany.
[00:43:48.178 --> 00:43:53.882]  So instead of having all these different payouts, these different payments, you get one payment for everyone.
[00:43:54.122 --> 00:43:56.844]  So that way they can prolong the social welfare system.
[00:43:59.566 --> 00:44:00.527]  Because it gets cheaper.
[00:44:00.568 --> 00:44:02.810]  You don't have to hunt every dollar.
[00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:04.092]  You don't have to hunt every euro.
[00:44:04.112 --> 00:44:07.376]  You just have a fixed amount of money paid to every person each month.
[00:44:07.736 --> 00:44:10.300]  So you can pay the rent, you can pay your Netflix, everything.
[00:44:12.422 --> 00:44:16.768]  One thing is to keep the new low class, the precariat, happy with that.
[00:44:17.188 --> 00:44:23.536]  You get food, you get your rent paid and so the precariat will defend the new order.
[00:44:24.637 --> 00:44:31.645]  And also we've seen companies announcing they're going to return to Europe and return to America with their production like Nike or Adidas.
[00:44:32.726 --> 00:44:36.669]  They've announced they bring the production back home, but it's going to be robot factories.
[00:44:36.929 --> 00:44:39.431]  So, not a lot of jobs here.
[00:44:39.792 --> 00:44:46.016]  So, more people in the precariat, more people to keep happy, more people to keep into the system they're going to defend.
[00:44:46.397 --> 00:44:53.642]  Because, imagine going to someone and saying, you know, we need to change this, you know, you shouldn't be getting this free money each month.
[00:44:53.882 --> 00:44:58.466]  But, it's going to be cool at first for some people, but it's going to be conditional.
[00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:01.764]  They announced it as unconditional, but it's going to be conditional.
[00:45:01.804 --> 00:45:03.866]  At some point, you know, you can't speak out.
[00:45:04.146 --> 00:45:05.507]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:45:05.587 --> 00:45:09.929]  And obviously, you're going to have to work at some in some capacity.
[00:45:10.029 --> 00:45:14.792]  And before you know it, you're going to have a system that was like here in East Germany.
[00:45:14.992 --> 00:45:15.753]  It'll be a minder.
[00:45:16.355 --> 00:45:19.598]  Walk around and follow people around and report on them to the government.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.562]  In this place, in Eastern Germany, it was illegal not to work.
[00:45:23.883 --> 00:45:32.451]  So if the government could provide 10 jobs, they would stick 15 to 20 people to do the work of 10 people.
[00:45:32.932 --> 00:45:35.695]  Just so that everybody had to report to work and go to work.
[00:45:36.295 --> 00:45:42.103]  Even if they were making stuff that nobody really needed or it was low quality, but it was a requirement for you to work.
[00:45:42.143 --> 00:45:43.746]  You were going to prison if you didn't work.
[00:45:44.707 --> 00:45:51.196]  And so, they're bringing this back and it's interesting enough that a company that is represented here every year, Siemens,
[00:45:52.718 --> 00:45:55.940]  They sold computers to the Eastern Bloc, especially the Stasi.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:03.926]  The Stasi was using a Siemens computer up until 1987 for the most intimate database of agents and what they provided.
[00:46:04.587 --> 00:46:11.332]  And so it's pretty interesting to see that these companies, they were creating the system as we know it.
[00:46:12.413 --> 00:46:24.760]  And so here you have like the Western left, kind of the Fabian society created left, and that was a ploy basically to protect against the Eastern infiltration.
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:28.562]  Because the Eastern bloc was closed and today it's closing again.
[00:46:29.383 --> 00:46:31.684]  So the West is an open society.
[00:46:31.784 --> 00:46:34.286]  So the Western globalists, they were thinking,
[00:46:35.066 --> 00:46:46.772]  If we support communism in the East through these companies like IBM, Fiat, all these companies that are at Bilderberg, we build up communism in the East, we have to protect against it in the West.
[00:46:46.932 --> 00:46:53.696]  And so they created their own leftist groups that sounded like the Eastern groups, but they were run by the Fabian Society.
[00:46:53.976 --> 00:46:58.839]  And so a lot of people, they didn't even know what they were following because they sounded all the same.

[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:09.783]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:16.706]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.990]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:58.330]  That's sad.
[00:48:58.350 --> 00:48:59.010]  That's real sad.
[00:48:59.031 --> 00:48:59.891]  He's against you.
[00:49:17.335 --> 00:49:19.857]  Why would you support a racist?
[00:49:19.917 --> 00:49:23.979]  He's gonna send you back to Africa, that's what he said.
[00:49:24.179 --> 00:49:28.402]  He said send Mexicans back to Mexico.
[00:49:28.702 --> 00:49:34.386]  You are a disgrace to America for being a young black man supporting a racist.
[00:49:34.446 --> 00:49:34.866]  Thank you.
[00:49:34.886 --> 00:49:36.007]  Yeah, that is awesome.
[00:49:36.787 --> 00:49:37.468]  That's sad!
[00:49:37.688 --> 00:49:38.348]  That's awesome.
[00:49:38.409 --> 00:49:41.311]  How does your parents feel about you holding a Trump stand?
[00:49:41.331 --> 00:49:42.432]  Well, they're from Pennsylvania.
[00:49:42.632 --> 00:49:46.915]  Well, they're straight to America, too, because he doesn't like you or your parents.
[00:49:46.975 --> 00:49:49.457]  Yeah, you didn't answer my question, by the way.
[00:49:49.538 --> 00:49:51.019]  Yeah, you didn't answer our question.
[00:49:51.059 --> 00:49:51.939]  What has he said?
[00:49:51.959 --> 00:49:54.201]  He said send Mexicans back to Mexico.
[00:49:54.361 --> 00:49:56.263]  No, he said- He said don't let Muslims here.
[00:49:56.283 --> 00:49:57.044]  Yeah, he said- What?
[00:49:57.084 --> 00:49:59.806]  He said, are you going to let me talk or are you going to yell?
[00:50:00.146 --> 00:50:04.871]  No, I'm telling you because you're holding it back and you need to be taught.
[00:50:04.911 --> 00:50:05.751]  We cannot do that, right?
[00:50:06.532 --> 00:50:07.313]  Okay, okay.
[00:50:07.813 --> 00:50:11.657]  He just graduated high school, so she's not a kid no more.
[00:50:12.137 --> 00:50:13.138]  Okay.
[00:50:13.299 --> 00:50:17.703]  What would you tell him when a racist sent a Mexican back to Mexico?
[00:50:18.243 --> 00:50:20.044]  What would you tell a young black man?
[00:50:20.144 --> 00:50:22.505]  I only believe that he's going to send illegals back.
[00:50:22.885 --> 00:50:23.685]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:23.705 --> 00:50:25.806]  That's what he said.
[00:50:25.846 --> 00:50:26.867]  He said illegals.
[00:50:26.887 --> 00:50:27.467]  Not illegals.
[00:50:27.567 --> 00:50:28.848]  Illegals only.
[00:50:29.668 --> 00:50:31.169]  His wife is not legal.
[00:50:31.189 --> 00:50:31.989]  She's from Europe.
[00:50:32.289 --> 00:50:32.849]  She's legal.
[00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:38.414]  She was born in Europe.
[00:50:38.534 --> 00:50:39.055]  She has U.S.
[00:50:39.075 --> 00:50:39.695]  citizenship.
[00:50:39.775 --> 00:50:46.722]  Just because she was born in another country does not mean she has a legal citizenship.
[00:50:47.062 --> 00:50:48.784]  She was born in Europe.
[00:50:48.804 --> 00:50:50.085]  That makes her illegal.
[00:50:50.325 --> 00:50:53.008]  This guy has a very small grasp of reality.
[00:50:53.068 --> 00:50:55.891]  I would say he's the one who is a racist.
[00:50:55.931 --> 00:50:57.832]  He's wearing a Black Lives Matter t-shirt.
[00:50:58.813 --> 00:51:01.755]  And, uh, obviously rejecting all lives matter.
[00:51:02.156 --> 00:51:03.237]  So there's the video right now.
[00:51:03.277 --> 00:51:06.379]  It's got over a million views on our YouTube channel, probably.
[00:51:06.799 --> 00:51:11.162]  I think on our Facebook post, other people grabbed it on Facebook and it's got millions of views on Facebook.
[00:51:11.182 --> 00:51:13.864]  Just a young man, his name is Quaterius Manuel.
[00:51:14.305 --> 00:51:15.686]  So, do you see how it works?
[00:51:15.746 --> 00:51:22.090]  Just by standing up and just standing there and letting the opposition talk themselves into a hole, you could really make these people look like fools.
[00:51:22.751 --> 00:51:24.032]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:31.091]  And so, had you been sparring with this guy verbally before, or did this just all happen spontaneously?
[00:51:31.471 --> 00:51:37.893]  So, I woke up, obviously, you know, the night before I learned out that Trump was coming to Atlanta.
[00:51:38.293 --> 00:51:43.154]  So, I decided I wanted to come to go see Trump, because he's my candidate, as you can see.
[00:51:43.694 --> 00:51:47.594]  And so, I went in line with my friend Brett and I, and Callie, and Mallory.
[00:51:47.694 --> 00:51:49.735]  So, we were sitting there, and then
[00:51:50.535 --> 00:51:55.639]  The guy came to us, he approached us, and he just started attacking us verbally.
[00:51:55.699 --> 00:52:02.725]  And then we tried our best to inform him on issues, and he obviously did not know.
[00:52:02.745 --> 00:52:04.907]  He called the KKK the KK.
[00:52:05.287 --> 00:52:07.409]  He didn't know what legal immigration was.
[00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:08.610]  It was just insane.
[00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:14.253]  Yeah, I think the funniest thing was that he wants to ship black people back to Africa.
[00:52:14.353 --> 00:52:18.374]  That, to me, was one of the funniest statements I've ever heard from a grown man.
[00:52:18.394 --> 00:52:21.335]  And he's not calling shipping anybody back.
[00:52:21.575 --> 00:52:26.797]  He's just saying people who have broken the law, illegal immigrants, he's saying, hey, we have to have a system.
[00:52:27.057 --> 00:52:28.077]  We have to ship these people back.
[00:52:28.117 --> 00:52:30.658]  He goes, we may even allow them to come back in, but we have to.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.081]  We're good to go.
[00:52:46.564 --> 00:52:46.944]  Yeah.
[00:52:47.705 --> 00:52:52.049]  Like I said, these liberals, they just want free stuff.
[00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:54.972]  And Trump is not buying it.
[00:52:55.032 --> 00:52:55.913]  He's not buying it.
[00:52:55.953 --> 00:53:04.441]  We're not going to continue to let our country go to the ground when Trump is our president because he's going to stop illegal immigration.
[00:53:04.861 --> 00:53:05.281]  I would agree.
[00:53:05.321 --> 00:53:11.745]  And I'll lump the Republicans in there with the Democrats who like illegal immigration because the Democrats like it because it creates a big voting base.
[00:53:27.234 --> 00:53:31.717]  And the Republicans like it because it creates a form of cheap labor that they can exploit.
[00:53:32.077 --> 00:53:33.798]  And I say shame on both these groups.
[00:53:34.178 --> 00:53:35.499]  Shame on exploiting people.
[00:53:35.859 --> 00:53:44.905]  Because in addition to just bringing people in as cheap labor, how many people are dying just to make that journey because they think there's a glimmer of hope that they can get in?
[00:53:45.265 --> 00:53:47.026]  How much of the drug trade is fueled by this?
[00:53:47.066 --> 00:53:47.947]  The coyote trade?
[00:53:48.187 --> 00:53:56.292]  I mean, we're keeping really bad people in power and in money well financed just by allowing this system to continue.
[00:53:57.037 --> 00:53:58.078]  Exactly, the rape.
[00:53:58.178 --> 00:54:00.078]  I mean, look at all these illegal Mexicans.
[00:54:00.118 --> 00:54:13.665]  They come in here and I was, I don't know if you know anything about Georgia, but I was in Dunwoody and then I saw I was out there playing soccer with my friend and we noticed some Hispanics come up to us.
[00:54:14.705 --> 00:54:22.651]  I'm just doing what, I'm just profiling, you know, based on what information I was given using my context clues, something I was taught to do in third grade.
[00:54:22.771 --> 00:54:27.414]  But, um, so I, I used them, I asked them and they, first of all, they didn't know any English.
[00:54:28.015 --> 00:54:29.235]  And I was like, well, how old are you?
[00:54:29.255 --> 00:54:29.756]  He's like, I'm 15.
[00:54:29.876 --> 00:54:32.178]  I was like, okay, what school do you go to?
[00:54:32.198 --> 00:54:32.878]  You know, I'm, I'm 16.
[00:54:33.018 --> 00:54:34.519]  I want to know what school you go to.
[00:54:34.539 --> 00:54:36.180]  He's like, we're not going to school yet.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:36.981]  We're just working.
[00:54:37.321 --> 00:54:38.402]  I was like, so how'd you get here?
[00:54:38.422 --> 00:54:40.083]  He's like, I got here two weeks ago.
[00:54:40.103 --> 00:54:41.304]  I was like, how?
[00:54:41.624 --> 00:54:42.205]  He was like,
[00:54:43.065 --> 00:54:45.487]  He just couldn't give me answers because he didn't learn English.
[00:54:45.888 --> 00:54:47.229]  So I just assumed he was illegal.
[00:54:47.249 --> 00:54:48.089]  I was like, where are you from?
[00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:49.951]  He was like, my cousin's from Mexico.
[00:54:49.971 --> 00:54:50.911]  I'm from Guatemala.
[00:54:51.332 --> 00:54:53.534]  And I said, well, why are you here?
[00:54:53.554 --> 00:54:57.557]  He was like, you know, we come here because it's a better opportunity.
[00:54:57.937 --> 00:54:59.098]  I said, well, are you legal?
[00:54:59.118 --> 00:55:01.200]  Do you have ID, a citizenship or anything?
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:01.860]  He was like, no.
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:04.882]  And then that's when some more started coming towards me.
[00:55:04.902 --> 00:55:07.965]  And, you know, basically I think it was one guy, you know, a little English.
[00:55:08.005 --> 00:55:10.287]  And he asked, he was like, why are you in front of my friend?
[00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:11.768]  I was like, because he's illegal.
[00:55:12.268 --> 00:55:14.089]  And I don't agree with illegal immigration.
[00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:20.732]  So long story short, we ended up reporting a guy to the police officers, and the police got the guy in custody.
[00:55:20.752 --> 00:55:22.333]  I don't know anything about him now.
[00:55:22.393 --> 00:55:25.534]  But yeah, I just showed you how much they come over.
[00:55:25.554 --> 00:55:27.435]  They're making their way to Georgia now.
[00:55:28.075 --> 00:55:38.484]  There was a report last week of an 18-wheeler driver who just stopped in the middle at a rest stop and it was on his way, I think, to some other city.
[00:55:38.504 --> 00:55:39.806]  He was coming from El Paso.
[00:55:40.126 --> 00:55:45.191]  He stopped in the middle, let out a whole truckload of illegals, and they were just wandering around the truck stop.
[00:55:45.231 --> 00:55:46.352]  They didn't even know where they were.
[00:55:46.972 --> 00:55:49.335]  I mean, this is not right on so many levels.
[00:55:49.355 --> 00:55:52.880]  So people who sit there and say illegal immigration is good, it's not doing anything.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.723]  It's not helping any side of the equation.
[00:55:56.003 --> 00:55:59.388]  And it's also driving down our wages, if people want to look at it that way.
[00:55:59.648 --> 00:56:02.632]  But what got you into Trump in the first place?
[00:56:02.672 --> 00:56:04.094]  What really attracted you to him?
[00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:08.071]  So originally I was, I've been always Republican.
[00:56:08.611 --> 00:56:12.853]  Um, I grew up in a conservative home, obviously in Georgia, suburbs of Georgia.
[00:56:13.153 --> 00:56:15.774]  Um, I did not like Trump at first.
[00:56:15.934 --> 00:56:16.934]  I'm not even dislike him.
[00:56:16.974 --> 00:56:17.994]  He was my second option.
[00:56:18.355 --> 00:56:27.218]  My number one option was Ted Cruz because I thought Ted Cruz has conservative principles that I was for as far as like free markets, stuff like that.
[00:56:27.278 --> 00:56:30.018]  That's true conservative on the economic side.
[00:56:30.059 --> 00:56:30.559]  You know what I mean?
[00:56:31.079 --> 00:56:34.280]  So, and I thought he had this, this great Christian belief because I am a
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:34.600]  Yeah.
[00:56:55.783 --> 00:56:59.744]  I thought he was the guy that I needed to take on Washington with his conservative values.
[00:57:00.104 --> 00:57:05.265]  And then when he dropped out, when he lost Indiana primary, I was devastated, you know?
[00:57:05.345 --> 00:57:06.785]  I was like, oh my god!
[00:57:06.805 --> 00:57:19.407]  And then also what made me influence my decision, if you saw the latest polls of CNN and Fox are coming out, Ted Cruz is beating Hillary by over like 11 points and Donald Trump is losing to Hillary by like 16.
[00:57:19.487 --> 00:57:22.508]  So I was like, well, where's Donald Trump's path to the
[00:57:22.808 --> 00:57:23.329]  Thank you.
[00:57:36.863 --> 00:57:41.704]  And I started researching why the liberal media portrays Donald Trump this way when he's really not.
[00:57:42.024 --> 00:57:44.025]  I mean, he has some of the biggest black supporters.
[00:57:44.065 --> 00:57:45.325]  He has Herman Cain.
[00:57:45.345 --> 00:57:49.346]  I mean, you can just go on and on, but that's just one big guy.
[00:57:50.406 --> 00:57:52.887]  And I looked into it, I was like, he's not this person.
[00:57:53.107 --> 00:57:54.207]  So why are the media doing that?
[00:57:54.247 --> 00:57:56.488]  And I thought Donald Trump had a chip on his shoulder.
[00:57:56.868 --> 00:57:57.448]  And I thought,
[00:57:57.848 --> 00:58:02.250]  I'm gonna support this guy because, for one, he's a GOP nominee, so I'm gonna support the nominee.
[00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:09.392]  I'm not like, I have so much respect for the Bush family, but I don't understand why it would not support the GOP nominee when it goes against Hillary.
[00:58:09.792 --> 00:58:11.893]  And I'm that guy that's like anyone but Hillary.
[00:58:12.153 --> 00:58:17.855]  And then I like, I fell in love with his policies on like immigration, education, getting rid of Common Core, etc.
[00:58:18.911 --> 00:58:22.473]  Yeah, and he's got a pretty favorable economic plan.
[00:58:22.734 --> 00:58:29.278]  A lot of people have looked at it and said, this plan is going to put money back in everybody's pocket, his tax program.
[00:58:29.738 --> 00:58:34.862]  He's also come out and said he wants to save Social Security and Medicare, which I think is an issue on both sides.
[00:58:34.902 --> 00:58:36.503]  People want to see how it can be saved.
[00:58:36.523 --> 00:58:41.846]  Obamacare is the worst thing that could ever happen to America, and he is going to repeal that.
[00:58:43.683 --> 00:58:45.024]  And that's it for our show tonight.
