[00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.467]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.547 --> 00:00:24.813]  It's November 10th, 2016.
[00:00:25.073 --> 00:00:26.416]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:29.644]  Tonight
[00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:41.408]  Donald Trump goes to the White House as reality finally sets in that a new sheriff is in town and he's about to drain the swamp.
[00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:52.934]  Then, the historic election of Donald Trump has shocked the world, leaving many commies, illegals, and members of the LGBT community in a total panic.
[00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:59.518]  And they take their anger to the streets, totally triggered by America's next president.
[00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:04.200]  Yeah, this is a public street.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.201]  How is he racist?
[00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:05.842]  How?
[00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:06.863]  Yeah.
[00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:18.075]  Plus, liberal Hollywood is running scared and they retreat to their safe spaces because they feel scared and threatened by our new commander-in-chief.
[00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:23.640]  All that plus much more, up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:36.090]  I want to see 10 million viewers tune in over the 50-plus hours, and that's where you come in.
[00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.271]  You are the heart and blood of the InfoWar.
[00:01:38.592 --> 00:01:49.860]  If you spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show and point out that this is the alternative new media, this is the rebellion, then all of you are riding right beside us, not behind us.
[00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:55.805]  So spread the word by Paul Reveres, no matter where you live in the world, to Information Warfare Arms.
[00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:59.188]  The globalists are coming, and they will be met on the field.
[00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:10.452]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:12.795]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:02:13.455 --> 00:02:15.378]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:19.924]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:02:20.044 --> 00:02:23.408]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.091]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:25.832]  Take action!
[00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:15.158]  Well folks, we are just two days removed from the election of Donald Trump to the office of United States President, and already big movements are happening, big shifts are happening, and big babies are out on the streets protesting.
[00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:22.104]  And today, Donald Trump went to his new office, he went to the White House, he spoke with Barack Obama.
[00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:28.670]  And this is going to be tough for me to do, but I am actually going to compliment Barack Obama here.
[00:03:29.892 --> 00:03:42.223]  First of all, I couldn't even imagine what this conversation was like considering the veracity between these two during the election cycle, the things that Obama has said about Trump, the things that Trump has said about Obama.
[00:03:42.604 --> 00:03:43.945]  It's almost as if Trump is now
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.923]  Being put into the realm of being a politician.
[00:03:50.244 --> 00:03:54.507]  Let's recall, Obama and Hillary fighting, fighting, fighting during their campaign.
[00:03:54.847 --> 00:03:56.268]  Now all of a sudden they love each other.
[00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.471]  Not saying Trump and Obama love each other, but they did meet today.
[00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:01.312]  Now, here were the powerful words
[00:04:02.153 --> 00:04:03.514]  That came from Barack Obama.
[00:04:18.246 --> 00:04:18.426]  Are we?
[00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:37.886]  We're good to go.
[00:04:56.573 --> 00:05:01.155]  Said I quote, we discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties.
[00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:05.297]  I very much looking forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel.
[00:05:05.837 --> 00:05:09.539]  I pray that Obama doesn't counsel Trump at all, but we'll see.
[00:05:10.447 --> 00:05:19.512]  This is again, this is Trump being presidential and he says, Mr. President, it was a great honor meeting you and I look forward to meeting with you many, many more times in the future.
[00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:21.613]  So again, this is Donald Trump being presidential.
[00:05:22.213 --> 00:05:23.614]  What you think of this visit?
[00:05:23.794 --> 00:05:27.996]  What you think of Barack Obama and Trump meeting and the things they said?
[00:05:29.397 --> 00:05:37.441]  We'll find out what kind of gravity or what type of honesty these comments had, but this was a major event and
[00:05:38.101 --> 00:05:47.629]  Again, if these people that take everything Barack Obama says as gospel, who are out protesting, I mean a lot of these people are protesting probably because of the things Obama said, demonizing Trump so much.
[00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.716]  Why don't they listen to Barack Obama and what he said there, saying we need to work together to make this country great again?
[00:05:54.816 --> 00:05:55.356]  Shocking!
[00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:57.518]  Shocking, Barack Obama.
[00:05:57.538 --> 00:05:58.479]  You know what this is though?
[00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:59.360]  I just realized this.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.883]  This is just like we saw earlier today on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:04.651 --> 00:06:07.793]  All of these politicians, folks, they're such frauds, they're such cowards.
[00:06:08.374 --> 00:06:17.880]  This is Obama realizing he's lost, realizing he's defeated, and just like any other shill politician, trying to cozy up to the people that are coming into power.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.681]  I think that that's what this is more than anything.
[00:06:19.981 --> 00:06:29.448]  But hey, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, and I hope that the protesters heed his call to work together with the people in the Trump movement to make this country better, because that's all we want to do.
[00:06:30.268 --> 00:06:34.391]  I wish you weren't brainwashed protesting, and we'll get into this right now.
[00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:36.572]  Anti-Trump protests turn violent.
[00:06:36.972 --> 00:06:47.259]  Cops clash with 6,000-strong crowd in Oakland as activists block roads in LA amid nationwide demonstrations that saw Madonna and Cher join 7,000 in New York City.
[00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:48.540]  Oh, Madonna and Cher.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.480]  Wait a second!
[00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:51.642]  Cher?
[00:06:52.342 --> 00:06:54.944]  Cher, you're supposed to be on the first plane out of town!
[00:06:56.237 --> 00:06:57.818]  You're not supposed to be protesting Donald Trump!
[00:06:57.858 --> 00:06:58.338]  You're out!
[00:06:58.598 --> 00:06:59.199]  You're moving!
[00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:00.219]  You're fleeing the country!
[00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:01.760]  Your house is on the market, Cher!
[00:07:02.141 --> 00:07:03.621]  What are you doing protesting?
[00:07:04.782 --> 00:07:05.823]  Is Cher that stupid?
[00:07:06.303 --> 00:07:07.464]  I mean, I guess that's the question.
[00:07:08.925 --> 00:07:15.589]  In Los Angeles, a disorganized protest of thousands saw fires on City Hall steps and Freeway 110 taken over.
[00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:17.310]  Wait a second.
[00:07:18.206 --> 00:07:23.369]  Wasn't it Trump that wasn't going to be able to hand over power peacefully?
[00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:25.370]  Wasn't it Obama telling us?
[00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.472]  Wasn't it Clinton telling us that it's a tradition in this country, the peaceful transition of power?
[00:07:30.873 --> 00:07:34.715]  But then, it's the Clinton supporters that are out there violent!
[00:07:35.135 --> 00:07:38.277]  It's the Clinton supporters that are burning the American flag!
[00:07:38.897 --> 00:07:39.557]  Shocking!
[00:07:40.218 --> 00:07:40.798]  Shocking!
[00:07:42.423 --> 00:07:46.566]  Oh, and by the way, you know, they're protesting because he's anti-woman.
[00:07:47.086 --> 00:07:55.451]  Kellyanne Conway, first woman to ever successfully be a campaign manager to win the office of president, okay?
[00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:59.274]  So, there's your anti-woman protest buried in the ground.
[00:07:59.494 --> 00:08:00.294]  But it goes further!
[00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:02.656]  They want white people to die!
[00:08:03.937 --> 00:08:09.020]  They want white people to die and they're spraying it on the sides of buildings
[00:08:10.853 --> 00:08:14.059]  Chanting it in the streets because Trump is such a racist now.
[00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:16.183]  Here's the thing For me.
[00:08:16.343 --> 00:08:19.770]  Oh and also Alex was talking about this a lot today
[00:08:21.598 --> 00:08:30.465]  The woman that went on CNN basically saying that violence needs to happen because of this Trump election and she said there will be casualties on both sides.
[00:08:31.466 --> 00:08:35.569]  Let me explain something to her and to anyone else who feels this way.
[00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.331]  I'm not a violent person.
[00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:39.492]  The Trump movement is not a violent movement, folks.
[00:08:39.532 --> 00:08:40.773]  We did this politically, okay?
[00:08:41.114 --> 00:08:42.215]  We didn't do it with protests.
[00:08:42.235 --> 00:08:43.536]  We didn't do it by burning flags.
[00:08:43.896 --> 00:08:44.676]  We did it politically.
[00:08:44.917 --> 00:08:45.557]  We did it with truth.
[00:08:45.697 --> 00:08:46.298]  We did it with honor.
[00:08:48.203 --> 00:08:52.324]  Now everything on the other side was done in dishonor and dishonesty, but we still were victorious.
[00:08:52.364 --> 00:08:53.184]  But let me explain something.
[00:08:54.205 --> 00:09:07.989]  If you're sitting here trying to promote a civil war between Trump supporters and the Trump protesters, or just any sort of a nature like that, your side will be eliminated in 24 hours.
[00:09:09.089 --> 00:09:10.729]  It will not even be a fight.
[00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.770]  Do they even understand that?
[00:09:13.777 --> 00:09:16.158]  She's calling for violence, but again, let me explain.
[00:09:16.178 --> 00:09:25.061]  If you really promoted a civil war against the Trump movement, you and everybody on your side of this would be eradicated within 24 hours.
[00:09:25.361 --> 00:09:26.562]  Now, this is not what we want.
[00:09:26.642 --> 00:09:28.382]  I'm not sitting here up here saying that that's what we want.
[00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:29.503]  Trust me, that's not what we want.
[00:09:29.883 --> 00:09:39.386]  I would rather see these people cleansed of their brainwashing and to join our movement and to actually want to build a better future for this country, for their lineage.
[00:09:40.166 --> 00:09:41.267]  But it's interesting because
[00:09:42.637 --> 00:09:45.138]  You know, we know that there's a depopulation plan in place.
[00:09:45.178 --> 00:09:48.300]  We know that they use the media to foment civil unrest.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.860]  Maybe this is what they want.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.361]  Maybe this is the agenda, folks.
[00:09:51.381 --> 00:09:52.121]  I mean, think about it.
[00:09:52.722 --> 00:09:57.324]  If they really want to promote this civil war, if they really want to push this civil war, we know what will happen.
[00:09:59.125 --> 00:09:59.285]  Now...
[00:10:00.347 --> 00:10:09.950]  Maybe this is the plan to eradicate the dumbest people in this country is by fomenting this civil war where the brainwashed masses try to take on the patriots.
[00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:17.512]  And then, you know, at the end of the day when the smoke clears within 24 hours, the brainwashed masses are gone.
[00:10:17.952 --> 00:10:21.593]  It's not what I want, but they're the ones on the streets calling for violence.
[00:10:21.713 --> 00:10:22.173]  You see that?
[00:10:22.373 --> 00:10:23.033]  That's not us.
[00:10:23.433 --> 00:10:25.994]  Even if Clinton won, we weren't calling for violence, folks.
[00:10:27.318 --> 00:10:31.442]  But they're already planning more protests, and we'll get to that in a minute.
[00:10:31.462 --> 00:10:34.604]  But look, you know, this is from InfoWars.com.
[00:10:34.644 --> 00:10:35.285]  Shock video.
[00:10:35.325 --> 00:10:37.487]  Black mob viciously beats white Trump voter.
[00:10:37.527 --> 00:10:38.688]  This isn't the first story.
[00:10:38.708 --> 00:10:41.590]  This isn't the first video.
[00:10:43.132 --> 00:10:44.613]  But Trump is racist.
[00:10:44.793 --> 00:10:46.194]  Trump supporters are racist.
[00:10:46.234 --> 00:10:46.895]  There's the video.
[00:10:46.915 --> 00:10:47.756]  This is disgusting.
[00:10:47.776 --> 00:10:48.576]  You know what, folks?
[00:10:48.596 --> 00:10:49.297]  Let me tell you something.
[00:10:53.004 --> 00:10:53.505]  I shouldn't even say.
[00:10:53.525 --> 00:10:55.266]  I'm not going to try to sound like Alex Jones here.
[00:10:55.306 --> 00:10:56.727]  It's just, don't try that crap with me.
[00:10:56.988 --> 00:10:57.248]  Okay?
[00:10:57.388 --> 00:10:58.209]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:10:58.649 --> 00:10:59.330]  Now here's the thing.
[00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:08.198]  Van Jones, who is a friend of mine, many of you have probably seen Van Jones and I in a conversation on the streets.
[00:11:08.218 --> 00:11:10.380]  Van Jones, he can't handle this.
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.981]  Van Jones, he doesn't know what to do.
[00:11:12.813 --> 00:11:15.774]  You know, because Trump is worse than a racist.
[00:11:15.835 --> 00:11:16.755]  I'm quoting Van Jones.
[00:11:16.775 --> 00:11:18.096]  He's worse than a racist.
[00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:25.579]  I mean, so, you know, in Van Jones' mind, somebody who's worse than a racist, worse than Hitler, I guess, just got elected president.
[00:11:25.599 --> 00:11:26.200]  That's Van Jones.
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.060]  He doesn't know what to do, folks.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.161]  He doesn't know what to tell his kids.
[00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:29.741]  He doesn't know what to tell his audience.
[00:11:30.662 --> 00:11:31.682]  But here's what he is telling them.
[00:11:32.503 --> 00:11:34.224]  He's telling them that this was a whitelash.
[00:11:35.344 --> 00:11:37.025]  So here's my question to Van Jones.
[00:11:37.545 --> 00:11:40.707]  Hey, Van, are you going to take responsibility for this crap?
[00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:50.035]  Are you going to take responsibility for these innocent white people getting savagely beaten by black people because they believe that racism is prevalent?
[00:11:50.055 --> 00:11:51.996]  They believe that these Trump voters are racist?
[00:11:53.077 --> 00:11:56.139]  Are you going to feel guilt for that, Van Jones?
[00:11:56.159 --> 00:11:59.842]  Are you going to take any responsibility for that mainstream media, Barack Obama?
[00:12:00.763 --> 00:12:01.143]  I doubt it.
[00:12:02.546 --> 00:12:02.926]  I doubt it.
[00:12:03.106 --> 00:12:15.770]  But I'll tell you what, we're gonna hold you accountable, we know who you are, we know what you're doing, and Van Jones, we had a powerful discussion on the street, but I just gotta say, my friend, you really need to think about what you're doing.
[00:12:16.971 --> 00:12:19.572]  Believe whatever you want about Trump, that's perfectly fine.
[00:12:20.372 --> 00:12:30.055]  But if you don't understand that you're fomenting racial violence in this country, and that now what you're seeing on the streets, with white people getting beaten because they're Trump supporters,
[00:12:31.257 --> 00:12:33.437]  You just need to take a serious look in the mirror, Van Jones.
[00:12:34.338 --> 00:12:36.358]  And that goes to all the mainstream media out there.
[00:12:37.338 --> 00:12:38.798]  We know exactly what you did.
[00:12:38.878 --> 00:12:40.459]  We know exactly who's to blame.
[00:12:41.539 --> 00:12:50.380]  And I think it's sad that Van Jones gets up here, demonizes Donald Trump, and then foments racial violence in this country.
[00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:54.101]  That's deplorable to me.
[00:12:55.461 --> 00:12:59.202]  Now, we've got Trump protests already happening by the thousands.
[00:13:00.299 --> 00:13:03.284]  But they're already planning on protesting the inauguration, folks.
[00:13:04.285 --> 00:13:06.950]  Protest at Trump's presidential inauguration.
[00:13:07.951 --> 00:13:11.898]  These are flyers that are being handed out at protests all across this country.
[00:13:11.918 --> 00:13:14.221]  Hmm, I wonder if George Soros has anything to do with this.
[00:13:15.976 --> 00:13:18.077]  And there's also Facebook groups.
[00:13:18.217 --> 00:13:21.519]  So you got buses taking people to D.C.
[00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:23.340]  to protest Trump's inauguration.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.582]  You've got all of these Facebook groups sprouting up now.
[00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:31.044]  They're going to go protest Donald Trump's nomination.
[00:13:31.204 --> 00:13:32.285]  Not my president!
[00:13:32.405 --> 00:13:33.585]  Not my president!
[00:13:35.547 --> 00:13:37.328]  Well, he is your president.
[00:13:38.088 --> 00:13:43.411]  And no matter how much you protest, he's going to be the next president of the United States.
[00:13:44.531 --> 00:13:49.834]  And the sad thing about it, folks, is the mindset of these people.
[00:13:51.174 --> 00:13:55.356]  Morning after Donald Trump's election, people are comparing it to 9-11.
[00:13:55.957 --> 00:14:07.703]  Now, they're doing this because of the numerics, so they're saying, oh, you know, 11-9, 9-11, but they're actually also comparing these events.
[00:14:09.755 --> 00:14:16.360]  Just yesterday in the LA Times, students who were protesting were being interviewed, and they're saying, why are you protesting?
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.762]  Because this is devastating!
[00:14:18.282 --> 00:14:20.304]  Trump's nomination is devastating!
[00:14:20.684 --> 00:14:21.525]  Devastating!
[00:14:22.405 --> 00:14:23.246]  Devastating!
[00:14:23.626 --> 00:14:26.869]  You don't have a clue about devastation, okay?
[00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:28.430]  Let's be perfectly clear.
[00:14:28.771 --> 00:14:37.157]  So this is the nature of the Donald Trump protesters beating white people in the street because they're racist, comparing the election of Trump to devastation and 9-11.
[00:14:39.195 --> 00:14:40.676]  Truly pathetic.
[00:14:41.176 --> 00:14:43.337]  And I'll tell you what, your time is done.
[00:14:43.357 --> 00:14:44.698]  This is it for you.
[00:14:45.158 --> 00:14:46.719]  Enjoy your little protest, okay?
[00:14:47.139 --> 00:14:51.761]  Enjoy your little protest, have a little pizza and soda party and do whatever you want to do.
[00:14:51.821 --> 00:14:53.002]  This is it for you, okay?
[00:14:53.202 --> 00:14:53.622]  You're done.
[00:14:54.422 --> 00:14:54.762]  You're done.
[00:14:55.082 --> 00:14:56.163]  So enjoy it while it lasts.
[00:14:57.183 --> 00:14:59.665]  Hollywood studios are in a daze.
[00:15:00.305 --> 00:15:00.845]  A daze!
[00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:04.367]  Many of us will be scared and threatened.
[00:15:05.686 --> 00:15:16.454]  Oh my gosh, folks, a strange silence has descended on Hollywood Wednesday as stunned studio executives, agents, and producers went through the motions as they tried to process Hillary Clinton's surprise loss to Donald Trump.
[00:15:16.774 --> 00:15:18.035]  It's so surprising!
[00:15:18.295 --> 00:15:19.356]  What about the polls?
[00:15:19.897 --> 00:15:20.697]  I saw the polls.
[00:15:20.717 --> 00:15:21.518]  Hillary was winning.
[00:15:21.558 --> 00:15:22.178]  I'm shocked!
[00:15:22.619 --> 00:15:23.639]  What is going on here?
[00:15:24.611 --> 00:15:28.192]  And then, Jeremy Zimmer sends out this memo.
[00:15:28.893 --> 00:15:32.314]  Jeremy Zimmer is a talent agent, a CEO of a talent agency.
[00:15:32.794 --> 00:15:36.116]  Many of us will be scared and threatened, and we can give comfort.
[00:15:36.636 --> 00:15:42.258]  Some of us will be happy because our voice was heard, but either way, it's a challenging moment, so let's be extra sensitive.
[00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:47.200]  We need to be extra sensitive with these snowflakes that can't handle Donald Trump, folks.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:48.601]  Well, here's an idea.
[00:15:49.997 --> 00:15:51.078]  Cal Exit.
[00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:54.882]  Hollywood, you're in California, maybe you can join the Cal Exit.
[00:15:54.922 --> 00:15:57.724]  California wants to succeed from US over Trump election.
[00:15:59.566 --> 00:16:01.748]  Tell you what, go ahead and succeed.
[00:16:02.489 --> 00:16:05.392]  You have more debt than any other state in this country.
[00:16:06.252 --> 00:16:07.353]  And then we'll take it one further.
[00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.015]  You can have Hillary Clinton as your president.
[00:16:09.676 --> 00:16:10.777]  So that'll be nice for you.
[00:16:10.817 --> 00:16:11.257]  Go ahead.
[00:16:11.577 --> 00:16:12.799]  And then maybe we'll build a wall.
[00:16:13.595 --> 00:16:16.236]  Maybe we'll build a wall on the California border, too.
[00:16:16.296 --> 00:16:16.976]  How do you like that?
[00:16:17.036 --> 00:16:17.936]  You won't be able to afford it.
[00:16:17.976 --> 00:16:18.756]  You can't afford anything.
[00:16:18.796 --> 00:16:20.017]  You're so much in debt, California.
[00:16:20.237 --> 00:16:20.937]  But I will say this.
[00:16:21.617 --> 00:16:24.118]  People were asking me how I feel about the Electoral College.
[00:16:24.918 --> 00:16:32.840]  Seeing the fact that California could basically, with the popular vote, determine the presidential election, I'm going to have to say that I like the Electoral College.
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.341]  I don't want those brain-dead liberals in California deciding who's president.
[00:16:38.103 --> 00:16:43.348]  The one scenario, now this is interesting folks, maybe there is some hope for people like Sarah Silverman and Amy Schumer.
[00:16:43.648 --> 00:16:44.849]  They were looking for hope.
[00:16:44.989 --> 00:16:46.611]  I mean they have no hope because Trump won.
[00:16:47.071 --> 00:16:57.500]  The one scenario that could still get Hillary Clinton into the White House, now of course this would be the Electoral College voters not voting with the decision of the actual voters.
[00:16:57.901 --> 00:16:59.862]  This is called the Faithless Elector.
[00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:03.740]  And of course the whole entire map is red, folks.
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:09.583]  Every county except the inner cities and the sanctuary cities is red.
[00:17:09.683 --> 00:17:10.823]  Those are the only cities that are blue.
[00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:11.364]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:17:11.384 --> 00:17:12.284]  There's the map right there.
[00:17:12.704 --> 00:17:14.085]  So for them to do that would be...
[00:17:15.745 --> 00:17:19.509]  I mean, such treason against the American public, it would be unbelievable.
[00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:25.175]  But hey, maybe that's some hope for your movement, Sarah Silverman, whatever that is.
[00:17:25.535 --> 00:17:32.762]  Or Bernie Sanders actually suggested today he might be considering running for president in 2020, so maybe Bernie Sanders comes back in.
[00:17:33.243 --> 00:17:35.685]  That would actually be interesting, even though he's a total shill.
[00:17:35.966 --> 00:17:37.547]  But of course, I guess that's why they would want him in.
[00:17:38.268 --> 00:17:42.349]  Now, James Comey faces a complicated path under Trump administration.
[00:17:42.989 --> 00:17:49.111]  Does he try to serve out the remaining seven years of his term under a president who has publicly questioned the FBI's integrity?
[00:17:49.391 --> 00:17:51.232]  Well, yeah, they can't even indict a known criminal.
[00:17:51.692 --> 00:17:57.814]  Or does he stay on as a safeguard against executive power and a guide for a novice president on complex security matters?
[00:17:58.474 --> 00:18:02.315]  Or, I'll go ahead and throw another one out there for you, Yahoo, since you can't wrap your mind around it.
[00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:03.875]  Or he's fired!
[00:18:04.595 --> 00:18:05.876]  You're fired, James Comey!
[00:18:06.616 --> 00:18:16.946]  Now I thought that James Comey reopening this investigation into Clinton might mean that he has a spine left, he realized Trump was going to win, and he wanted to have a job in a Trump administration.
[00:18:17.146 --> 00:18:19.489]  But I'm not sure if that's the case.
[00:18:19.509 --> 00:18:20.770]  But I can't even believe Yahoo!
[00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:27.016]  Does James Comey stay in office in order to be a safeguard against Trump's executive power?
[00:18:27.897 --> 00:18:30.079]  How about all the executive orders from Barack Obama?
[00:18:31.383 --> 00:18:34.025]  Was James Comey doing anything about that?
[00:18:34.425 --> 00:18:34.766]  No!
[00:18:35.706 --> 00:18:38.648]  And the FBI is a failed agency.
[00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:42.391]  Again, they can't indict Hillary Clinton, who's already being indicted by the public.
[00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:44.453]  We have the WikiLeaks, we have all the information, folks.
[00:18:44.913 --> 00:18:52.459]  So, we'll see what happens with James Comey, but two days into the Trump election, and we're already seeing the aftermath.
[00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:07.154]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:19:07.694 --> 00:19:15.600]  Unveil the Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula 30 Servings Fruit Punch Flavor Dietary Supplement.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.961]  It is simply amazing.
[00:19:17.021 --> 00:19:17.962]  Infowarslife.com
[00:19:18.362 --> 00:19:22.764]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:19:23.285 --> 00:19:36.391]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:19:36.812 --> 00:19:37.972]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:19:37.992 --> 00:19:39.193]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:19:39.793 --> 00:19:45.297]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:48.339]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:19:48.379 --> 00:19:50.620]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:19:51.221 --> 00:19:57.365]  Some companies are going to take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:19:57.565 --> 00:19:58.806]  This is ultra-concentrated.
[00:19:58.826 --> 00:20:00.527]  We're not playing games here, okay?
[00:20:00.547 --> 00:20:01.568]  Well, that's my philosophy.
[00:20:01.588 --> 00:20:02.348]  That's your philosophy.
[00:20:02.488 --> 00:20:04.510]  But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.890]  Yeah.
[00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:06.591]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:20:06.871 --> 00:20:09.053]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[00:20:09.073 --> 00:20:09.513]  They're excellent.
[00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:11.074]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:20:11.214 --> 00:20:18.297]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:20:19.498 --> 00:20:39.088]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:20:39.611 --> 00:20:40.191]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:40.231 --> 00:20:43.392]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:20:43.472 --> 00:20:44.732]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:20:44.752 --> 00:20:45.333]  Tell folks about that.
[00:20:45.493 --> 00:20:48.233]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:20:48.253 --> 00:20:51.734]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:20:52.314 --> 00:20:58.676]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine, each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:20:59.096 --> 00:21:02.297]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:21:02.317 --> 00:21:03.838]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:21:04.058 --> 00:21:05.898]  Go to infowarslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:21:06.418 --> 00:21:08.699]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:21:09.119 --> 00:21:19.084]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there all it's got in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:21:19.104 --> 00:21:19.605]  Top left.
[00:21:19.665 --> 00:21:23.007]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:21:23.387 --> 00:21:29.850]  Vitamin A has 4,333 percent from beta carotene and what's another source?
[00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:30.891]  I show this all the best sources.
[00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:31.970]  Retinol.
[00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:36.472]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:21:36.813 --> 00:21:37.213]  And you know what?
[00:21:37.293 --> 00:21:39.454]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:21:39.694 --> 00:21:40.274]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:21:40.314 --> 00:21:47.318]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:21:47.638 --> 00:21:53.161]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:21:53.661 --> 00:21:54.522]  So get them today!

[00:21:59.607 --> 00:22:01.128]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:07.454]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:22:07.675 --> 00:22:08.816]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:22:10.237 --> 00:22:24.382]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:22:24.742 --> 00:22:28.644]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:22:32.765 --> 00:22:39.848]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:22:40.188 --> 00:22:45.870]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:52.152]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:22:52.472 --> 00:22:56.214]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:23:03.513 --> 00:23:09.555]  Well, we have video of NBC predicting a race war, telling Americans, you have absolutely no hope.
[00:23:09.975 --> 00:23:19.058]  They're claiming that Trump is welcomed only by despotic leaders, despite the fact that we saw Justin Trudeau just extend a hand of friendship, saying, let's renegotiate the terms of NAFTA.
[00:23:19.818 --> 00:23:21.598]  We've seen the Mexican people.
[00:23:21.618 --> 00:23:25.779]  There was an article yesterday talking about how Mexico is welcoming Donald Trump to the presidency.
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.120]  They're anxious to work with him.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:37.706]  And leaders extending the hand of friendship around the world, despite those facts, NBC is predicting that Americans have no hope and he's only welcomed by despots.
[00:23:37.906 --> 00:23:39.627]  That was the tagline.
[00:23:39.847 --> 00:23:45.390]  And this broadcast, it took place on Wednesday night, they appear to predict a full-on race war.
[00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.351]  That's what they're trying to do in this country.
[00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:49.052]  They want to spark a race war.
[00:23:49.672 --> 00:23:52.034]  They couldn't do it successfully before the election.
[00:23:52.134 --> 00:23:53.895]  They're clearly angry about that.
[00:23:54.455 --> 00:23:57.496]  And in this broadcast, they're predicting a race war in America.
[00:23:57.596 --> 00:24:01.918]  Now that Donald Trump is president, they're blaming the race war on Trump, the gall of them.
[00:24:01.938 --> 00:24:10.561]  Now we have this anchor, Lester Holt, and if you recall, he was the moderator in the second debate, probably the most biased moderator in U.S.
[00:24:10.621 --> 00:24:11.601]  history, frankly.
[00:24:11.981 --> 00:24:14.482]  He couldn't successfully hand the election to Hillary Clinton.
[00:24:14.862 --> 00:24:15.802]  You failed, sir.
[00:24:15.942 --> 00:24:22.865]  So now he's going on the attack and insinuating that in this report, he's using the phrase called whitelash.
[00:24:23.525 --> 00:24:26.607]  And specifically, he's referencing that term.
[00:24:26.647 --> 00:24:29.930]  It was originally done by Van Jones, who was an Obama adviser.
[00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.973]  And no surprise there, an anchor at the Clinton News Network now.
[00:24:34.093 --> 00:24:39.336]  So he said that while Donald Trump's many supporters are basking in his victory,
[00:24:40.197 --> 00:24:55.878]  Many woke up to the morning after the election feeling disillusioned by the headlines and clearly, and at this point Lester Holt is moaning this, time and time again critics accuse Trump of running a campaign with undercurrents of racism and those concerns persist now.
[00:24:56.298 --> 00:24:57.399]  Well, I've got news for you.
[00:24:57.499 --> 00:24:58.600]  They don't persist now.
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:13.491]  We have collective pockets, and we've successfully uncovered here on InfoWars how the Black Lives Matter movement, which is a Soros-funded project, they are often paid protesters, paid to agitate, and the mainstream media has done an incredible job.
[00:25:13.531 --> 00:25:22.157]  My hat's off to you, all of you, that have successfully lied to the American people, and you've sparked such incredible, divisive
[00:25:22.677 --> 00:25:23.218]  I don't know.
[00:25:39.205 --> 00:25:41.807]  Lily, your sign tonight says?
[00:25:41.947 --> 00:25:46.071]  Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about the things that matter.
[00:25:46.091 --> 00:25:49.134]  If we don't fight, who's going to fight for us?
[00:25:49.314 --> 00:25:51.756]  People had to die for freedom while we're at it today.
[00:25:52.277 --> 00:25:54.939]  We can't just do rallies, we have to fight back.
[00:25:55.279 --> 00:25:57.301]  There will be casualties on both sides.
[00:25:57.742 --> 00:26:01.245]  There will be because people have to die to make a change in this world.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.701]  Trump, enough with your racism!
[00:26:03.721 --> 00:26:04.901]  Stop splitting families!
[00:26:05.561 --> 00:26:06.802]  Don't split my family!
[00:26:08.102 --> 00:26:10.263]  And you're fearful that you're going to lose friends and relatives?
[00:26:10.323 --> 00:26:11.724]  A lot!
[00:26:11.824 --> 00:26:14.184]  Friends, family, even all races!
[00:26:14.224 --> 00:26:17.085]  Not just my Hispanic culture, but the rest of the races!
[00:26:18.266 --> 00:26:19.386]  Don't take away our rights!
[00:26:20.247 --> 00:26:21.867]  Impeach Donald Trump!
[00:26:22.047 --> 00:26:23.468]  That's what he needs to get, is impeach!
[00:26:30.296 --> 00:26:31.457]  You know, I'm speechless.
[00:26:31.477 --> 00:26:34.378]  I think I just heard her call for people to die.
[00:26:35.159 --> 00:26:44.063]  This woman who is protesting so violently is calling for violence and death of fellow Americans because, quote, that's what it takes.
[00:26:44.123 --> 00:26:50.086]  Now, this massive anti Donald Trump protest, it was it was done in California a day after the election.
[00:26:50.126 --> 00:26:51.207]  CNN caught this video.
[00:26:51.647 --> 00:26:54.608]  And of course, we hear Don Lemon say, oh, we're not advocating violence.
[00:26:55.008 --> 00:26:59.589]  But then they go ahead and race bait every single day on that network.
[00:26:59.729 --> 00:27:02.730]  It is a different story about race baiting.
[00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:15.893]  And going back to Lester Holt for a moment and this fear mongering race report that he came up with, he cites we've got a situation where a reporter named Ron Allen, he was in front of the African-American Museum in Washington, D.C.
[00:27:16.753 --> 00:27:20.475]  And he goes on to say, and this is a part of this article that Steve Watson put together.
[00:27:20.535 --> 00:27:21.516]  It's up on our website.
[00:27:22.516 --> 00:27:24.497]  This is what Ron Allen, who's a reporter, had to say.
[00:27:24.517 --> 00:27:33.682]  He said, outside the nation's African American History Museum, there's deep worry about President-elect Donald Trump's victory and the huge turnout by rural working class white voters.
[00:27:34.442 --> 00:27:44.667]  The reporter then suggests that Trump was able to capture the White House only because of these disgruntled, idiot white Americans that are inherently racist and just simply afraid of diversity.
[00:27:44.687 --> 00:27:45.828]  Then he goes on to say this.
[00:27:46.428 --> 00:27:56.873]  They see what's been called white lash, rallied by a candidate who promised to ban Muslims, wall out Mexicans and challenge the very legitimacy of the nation's first black president.
[00:27:57.393 --> 00:27:59.394]  This election seems more like an eviction.
[00:27:59.855 --> 00:28:09.099]  And he talks about how white America, the disgruntled, you know, it plays hand in hand with what Barack Obama said about white Americans when he was campaigning.
[00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:10.400]  It wasn't successful enough.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.823]  I think it's a good narrative not to, you know, to deny him the presidency.
[00:28:14.843 --> 00:28:19.545]  But he said, you know, there's basically those ignorant Americans clinging to their guns and religion.
[00:28:20.006 --> 00:28:28.551]  Well, if my memory serves me correctly, the only people that we've seen clinging to guns and religion or swords and religion are radical Muslims in this day and age.
[00:28:28.591 --> 00:28:36.156]  So this Ron Allen, the fear mongering race report continues, and it's largely responsible
[00:28:36.716 --> 00:28:43.898]  For fueling the flames in this country, where we're seeing these incredible acts of violence and protests.
[00:28:43.918 --> 00:28:48.700]  We've covered the ones in Portland, Oregon, where we saw a mob of 100 cross the highway.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.621]  One man was actually hit in that protest.
[00:28:52.601 --> 00:28:54.542]  Coming out of Oakland, we saw rioting.
[00:28:54.622 --> 00:28:56.943]  We saw an American flag burn in the Portland incident.
[00:28:57.883 --> 00:29:03.505]  One Trump's supporting party was underway in San Francisco, and we saw violent acts there.
[00:29:04.705 --> 00:29:13.668]  And Paul Joseph Watson, the brother of Steve, he's coined a sister article, if you will, that talks about the violence that's continuing in America.
[00:29:13.808 --> 00:29:20.351]  And he actually put a video up, and this black mob is seen viciously beating a white Trump voter.
[00:29:20.571 --> 00:29:25.513]  And you can hear one of them say, you voted for Trump, you're going to pay for that SHIT.
[00:29:26.673 --> 00:29:31.474]  Paul points out in this video clip, and it's really violent, it's very shocking.
[00:29:31.494 --> 00:29:33.014]  This is coming outside of Chicago.
[00:29:33.494 --> 00:29:37.535]  It's a mob of black young men viciously beating an older white man because he voted for Donald Trump.
[00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:40.736]  They're dragging him through the streets as he hangs out of the back of the car.
[00:29:40.756 --> 00:29:48.017]  The clip, now there are two separate clips of this, it shows them repeatedly screaming, you voted for Donald Trump, as they assault him from every single angle.
[00:29:48.337 --> 00:29:50.518]  They steal his belongings, they take his car.
[00:29:51.478 --> 00:30:01.168]  Another woman who is on looking, she's shouting, beat his A double S. And then another man is heard laughing on this tape, don't vote for Trump.
[00:30:01.448 --> 00:30:04.051]  We have two videos of this incident.
[00:30:04.471 --> 00:30:09.897]  One is being called, it was dubbed and put up to the F Donald Trump song.
[00:30:10.337 --> 00:30:13.540]  It's a phrase now that's being chanted in these protests across the country.
[00:30:14.361 --> 00:30:18.064]  And this poor man, you can actually see him, his hand is stuck in the window.
[00:30:18.325 --> 00:30:21.407]  They actually drive off with his car, if you can believe that.
[00:30:21.748 --> 00:30:25.111]  And the scene is absolutely insane.
[00:30:25.611 --> 00:30:34.379]  They're of course accusing him of being linked to the quote racist candidate when overwhelming, overwhelming the American population they spoke.
[00:30:34.759 --> 00:30:37.660]  We don't even actually believe the real number that was reported.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:44.261]  We think that it was greater for Donald Trump, just from our experience of being on the ground covering Trump rallies and Trump movements.
[00:30:44.681 --> 00:30:47.722]  And we know that he had massive turnout.
[00:30:47.822 --> 00:30:51.683]  Owen and I were on the desk in real time watching the election unfold.
[00:30:51.763 --> 00:30:57.065]  And I have to tell you, the map was so overwhelmingly red everywhere.
[00:30:57.105 --> 00:30:58.165]  It was unbelievable.
[00:30:58.185 --> 00:31:02.986]  And this crazy narrative that the mainstream media is putting out there
[00:31:03.466 --> 00:31:03.706]  I think?
[00:31:23.035 --> 00:31:39.120]  And these crazy mainstream media hacks, they have done a bang-up job, let me tell you, of inciting violence and race-baiting with these white-lash comments, and then calling white America, you know, talking about the resentment of white America, which is the only reason why
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.881]  Trump was elected in the first place.
[00:31:41.001 --> 00:31:42.723]  That's the insinuation of Ron Allen.
[00:31:43.103 --> 00:31:55.454]  That's the insinuation of Lester Holt and the audacity of him, the honor to have to have moderated a presidential debate and then to come back and as true colors come out after the election, it turns out they lost.
[00:31:55.594 --> 00:31:59.938]  They're very bitter about losing this election and her camp, they're going to continue
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:10.044]  To fearmonger, to race bait, to misreport the facts, to lie to the American people, and incite as much violence as they can.
[00:32:10.064 --> 00:32:18.428]  Now, the most troubling aspect of this report for me, and it'll continue to be throughout the day, is the woman calling for death on CNN's channel.
[00:32:19.168 --> 00:32:23.270]  Death, you know, casualties on both sides is what she's calling for.
[00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.732]  And then she tells Trump, enough with your racism.
[00:32:27.572 --> 00:32:29.272]  Trump, enough with your racism.
[00:32:29.292 --> 00:32:30.072]  That's what she says.
[00:32:30.593 --> 00:32:33.453]  When, lady, are you joking me?
[00:32:34.093 --> 00:32:35.333]  Who's the racist here?
[00:32:35.473 --> 00:32:38.774]  Do you hear Trump calling for the death of innocent people?
[00:32:38.874 --> 00:32:39.454]  Absolutely not.
[00:32:39.494 --> 00:32:43.295]  So just bringing you the ability to see through these lies.
[00:32:43.355 --> 00:32:44.995]  We know that we have a very smart audience.
[00:32:45.055 --> 00:32:46.095]  You guys are on this.
[00:32:46.776 --> 00:32:48.496]  And make sure you follow these stories.
[00:32:48.516 --> 00:32:50.796]  They're up on our website, InfoWars.com.
[00:32:51.316 --> 00:32:54.117]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:33:05.742 --> 00:33:10.145]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:33:11.285 --> 00:33:12.926]  Will humanity survive?
[00:33:14.607 --> 00:33:16.609]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:28.016]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type one civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:40.076]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:33:41.577 --> 00:33:50.983]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.613]  And merging with artificial intelligence.
[00:33:57.373 --> 00:34:02.237]  So they're trying to end humanity as if it's a good thing and create this new species.
[00:34:02.537 --> 00:34:03.898]  Talk about mad scientists.
[00:34:04.518 --> 00:34:07.060]  And there have been several new articles on this just the last few weeks.
[00:34:07.361 --> 00:34:11.764]  DARPA is testing implantable chips in soldiers' brains is one of them.
[00:34:12.224 --> 00:34:15.887]  Another just came out in mid-April.
[00:34:16.047 --> 00:34:17.028]  Rich Americans
[00:34:18.155 --> 00:34:24.225]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:34:24.685 --> 00:34:32.798]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:34:34.008 --> 00:34:38.254]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:34:38.715 --> 00:34:47.548]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave him.
[00:34:48.008 --> 00:34:48.770]  This is from the state
[00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:54.334]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:34:54.874 --> 00:35:11.226]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood at basically every time a tiny brick into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on your body as well as your genes.
[00:35:12.367 --> 00:35:14.709]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:21.834]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:35:22.475 --> 00:35:24.841]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:27.552]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:35:28.432 --> 00:35:42.838]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[00:35:43.659 --> 00:35:44.699]  And the numbers are in.
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.040]  Screen time.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.320]  All the television.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.161]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:35:49.241 --> 00:35:51.082]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:35:51.402 --> 00:35:52.543]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:35:53.303 --> 00:35:54.984]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:35:55.564 --> 00:35:58.766]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:35:59.227 --> 00:36:04.930]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:18.378]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:36:19.078 --> 00:36:20.619]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:36:21.059 --> 00:36:22.260]  We can change our environment.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:30.987]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown in the ash heap of history.
[00:36:31.668 --> 00:36:47.481]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:36:47.941 --> 00:36:54.630]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2, Survival Shield, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:54.971 --> 00:36:59.537]  Again, that's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:59.897 --> 00:37:03.482]  Because I want to move to Spain.
[00:37:03.502 --> 00:37:05.404]  I really, really want to move to Spain right now.
[00:37:08.581 --> 00:37:12.944]  Rob Dew with InfoWars.com, and I would like to be the first to thank white America for ruining the country.
[00:37:13.484 --> 00:37:14.405]  Although I'm not the first.
[00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:19.889]  In fact, Van Jones went out on election night and got on CNN and said, it's white lash.
[00:37:20.169 --> 00:37:26.674]  And that's the reason it happened, because white people are so bad and evil and mad that they wanted to send a message that a woman couldn't be president.
[00:37:26.774 --> 00:37:27.735]  We've talked about race.
[00:37:27.755 --> 00:37:29.736]  I mean, we've talked about everything but race tonight.
[00:37:29.776 --> 00:37:30.597]  We've talked about income.
[00:37:30.637 --> 00:37:31.337]  We've talked about class.
[00:37:31.357 --> 00:37:32.038]  We've talked about region.
[00:37:32.218 --> 00:37:33.238]  We haven't talked about race.
[00:37:33.559 --> 00:37:34.799]  This was a white lash.
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.002]  This was a white lash against a changing country.
[00:37:39.703 --> 00:37:42.885]  It was a white lash against a black president, in part.
[00:37:43.566 --> 00:37:46.808]  And then last night we had Samantha Bee saying white people ruined America.
[00:37:46.828 --> 00:37:48.309]  That's right, here's the clip.
[00:37:48.569 --> 00:37:50.691]  People will be looking for someone to blame.
[00:37:50.911 --> 00:37:55.314]  The pollsters, the strident feminists, the Democratic Party, a vengeful God.
[00:37:55.394 --> 00:38:00.418]  But once you dust for fingerprints, it's pretty clear who ruined America.
[00:38:01.158 --> 00:38:01.739]  White people.
[00:38:02.185 --> 00:38:05.087]  She then joked and said, oh, I guess ruining Brooklyn was a dry run.
[00:38:05.148 --> 00:38:13.615]  That's right, because somebody who builds up properties and hires people to build them and maintain them is ruining America and ruining jobs.
[00:38:14.055 --> 00:38:15.336]  Just like he did in D.C.
[00:38:15.376 --> 00:38:16.377]  with the new post office.
[00:38:16.697 --> 00:38:20.560]  In fact, the government gave him the bid and he brought it in under budget and under time.
[00:38:20.921 --> 00:38:21.721]  That's terrible.
[00:38:21.781 --> 00:38:23.203]  That's the wrong thing to do, Donald.
[00:38:23.223 --> 00:38:25.444]  You're doing a horrible disservice to our country.
[00:38:25.725 --> 00:38:27.106]  But wait, we got more comedians.
[00:38:27.466 --> 00:38:32.950]  Here's Chelsea Handler, literally breaking down in tears that Hillary Clinton didn't win.
[00:38:33.731 --> 00:38:41.176]  And I think, I guess the message that I want to, like, spread out to other women is, is exactly what you're saying, is not to give up.
[00:38:41.456 --> 00:38:54.626]  Sorry, I hate crying on camera, but... Is not to give up, because this is so important, and it's easy to say, throw in the towel and that we're going to leave, or I'm going to move to Spain, because I want to move to Spain.
[00:38:54.686 --> 00:38:56.568]  I really, really want to move to Spain right now.
[00:38:57.216 --> 00:39:00.079]  And I'm going to get serious here in a second, but let me show you one more clip.
[00:39:00.859 --> 00:39:06.585]  Here's Seth Meyers wiping away the tears that his mother might not get to see the first woman president.
[00:39:07.145 --> 00:39:09.868]  Whoever you are, I hope I live to see your inauguration.
[00:39:10.769 --> 00:39:12.190]  And I hope my mom does too.
[00:39:12.791 --> 00:39:17.915]  She was really excited yesterday, and I was really sad for her.
[00:39:19.073 --> 00:39:25.156]  And then he went on to say, well, the first woman president could still be out there watching this and then you still get to be the first woman president.
[00:39:25.837 --> 00:39:30.199]  Look, people, it's not even the point that Hillary Clinton would have been or not have been the first woman president.
[00:39:30.759 --> 00:39:31.640]  She's an evil bitch.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:33.240]  That's the bottom line.
[00:39:33.561 --> 00:39:37.763]  In fact, one of her first jobs as a public defender was defending a child rapist.
[00:39:38.603 --> 00:39:45.187]  And she used tactics on this little girl who we had just behind me in the studio, Kathy Shelton, who was 12 years old when she was pulled off her bike and gang raped.
[00:39:46.347 --> 00:39:47.248]  How's that for feminism?
[00:39:47.867 --> 00:39:48.127]  Okay.
[00:39:48.607 --> 00:39:52.189]  And Hillary went on to take evidence and move it across state lines.
[00:39:52.229 --> 00:39:53.950]  She mishandled evidence in this case.
[00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:58.632]  She actually took this little girl, brought her up on the stand and made her cry.
[00:39:58.652 --> 00:40:03.334]  And she was using tactics now that are illegal under rape shield laws.
[00:40:04.195 --> 00:40:06.616]  Does that sound like a person that needs to be president?
[00:40:07.416 --> 00:40:09.077]  They jerked me off my bicycle.
[00:40:09.717 --> 00:40:15.960]  They put me in the truck and they were beating me and they raped me.
[00:40:18.126 --> 00:40:23.769]  He was saying he knew I liked it, except in a more terribly manner than that.
[00:40:23.789 --> 00:40:31.253]  I was left out on the ground, barely conscious.
[00:40:32.513 --> 00:40:35.115]  Sometimes, at one time, I was unconscious.
[00:40:36.325 --> 00:40:36.505]  Hmm.
[00:40:37.566 --> 00:40:44.550]  It's pretty funny though, watching people like Colbert on the Colbert Report having his election night special when they knew Hillary was going to win.
[00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:52.194]  They knew without a shadow of a doubt because she had sonared up in the polls and that they had, it was just nothing but a little bit of racist white people that were going to vote for Trump.
[00:40:53.271 --> 00:40:57.654]  And then watching them just almost cry on TV as they saw the results coming in.
[00:40:58.335 --> 00:41:06.040]  It's even funnier watching the Young Turks as a whole panel, watching the utter disdain on their faces because they lost.
[00:41:06.721 --> 00:41:07.261]  Get over it.
[00:41:07.481 --> 00:41:08.082]  Let's move on.
[00:41:08.402 --> 00:41:15.007]  Now, let's not keep encouraging people by going, it's only racists doing it because I'm not a racist and I voted for Donald Trump.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:16.581]  Period.
[00:41:17.102 --> 00:41:19.687]  And there's plenty of other people that voted for him that aren't racist either.
[00:41:20.028 --> 00:41:25.239]  And we don't have a desire to hate women and ruin this country with misogyny or xenophobia.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.443]  All we want to do is protect the border.
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:33.781]  Have fair elections and have a decent economy where everybody has a chance to succeed.
[00:41:34.301 --> 00:41:40.063]  And if you don't want that for people, if you think you have to run around and take care of everybody, then you're the real racist out there.
[00:41:40.563 --> 00:41:43.384]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:41:43.824 --> 00:41:45.244]  Good line for a comedy show, eh?
[00:41:46.084 --> 00:41:47.525]  I'm not sure if it's a comedy show at this point.
[00:42:05.188 --> 00:42:10.913]  Behind me stands the University of Texas tower where a large protest is going on, the F. Trump protest.
[00:42:11.654 --> 00:42:16.379]  We're not even 24 hours into his president-elect candidacy, and this is their reaction.
[00:42:16.639 --> 00:42:19.602]  They attack Trump as a racist, a misogynist, a rapist.
[00:42:20.262 --> 00:42:21.904]  But do they actually know the facts?
[00:42:22.524 --> 00:42:24.646]  What's your opinion of Trump being elected president?
[00:42:25.107 --> 00:42:27.149]  I'm really sad and disappointed.
[00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:28.170]  Why is that?
[00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:33.835]  Because I think he's a terrible person who doesn't deserve to be the face of the United States.
[00:42:34.116 --> 00:42:35.416]  Why is he a terrible person?
[00:42:35.736 --> 00:42:40.999]  Well, he's been accused of sexually assaulting several women.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:46.102]  He's also racist and quite clearly sexist, possibly homophobic.
[00:42:46.682 --> 00:42:47.843]  Okay, alright.
[00:42:47.863 --> 00:42:51.985]  Hillary was also under NYPD investigation.
[00:42:52.668 --> 00:43:02.552]  According to Eric Prince of Blackwater, and she was found to have visited Jeffrey Epstein's pedophile highland six times, so she is under investigation.
[00:43:02.692 --> 00:43:08.935]  I don't think several women have specifically come out and said, this person sexually assaulted me.
[00:43:09.415 --> 00:43:10.355]  About Hillary Clinton?
[00:43:10.936 --> 00:43:11.096]  Right.
[00:43:11.756 --> 00:43:12.396]  Yeah, they haven't.
[00:43:12.596 --> 00:43:13.697]  It's under investigation.
[00:43:13.837 --> 00:43:14.157]  Right.
[00:43:14.277 --> 00:43:15.358]  As is Donald Trump.
[00:43:15.398 --> 00:43:16.698]  Okay, what about the racism?
[00:43:17.358 --> 00:43:18.619]  What about the racism?
[00:43:18.659 --> 00:43:19.979]  How do you explain the racism?
[00:43:19.999 --> 00:43:21.200]  He was endorsed by the KKK.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.061]  Okay, he was endorsed by the KKK.
[00:43:23.121 --> 00:43:25.962]  I don't think any person who is the KKK is like, this is my guy.
[00:43:26.002 --> 00:43:29.323]  Do you realize Hillary Clinton's mentor was Robert Byrd?
[00:43:30.003 --> 00:43:30.824]  Is that just a joke?
[00:43:32.387 --> 00:43:33.288]  Is that just a joke to you?
[00:43:33.969 --> 00:43:34.590]  Is what a joke?
[00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:39.996]  Today our country has lost a true American original, my friend and mentor Robert C. Byrd.
[00:43:40.697 --> 00:43:44.421]  Senator Byrd was a man of surpassing eloquence and nobility.
[00:43:45.563 --> 00:43:51.169]  There are a lot of people who wrote these eulogies for Senator Byrd in the newspapers and I read a bunch of them.
[00:43:52.776 --> 00:43:54.717]  I don't understand why you ask if that's a joke.
[00:44:14.514 --> 00:44:17.817]  If Trump is a racist, why isn't Hillary Clinton a racist?
[00:44:18.618 --> 00:44:20.740]  Is KKK endorsing Hillary?
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.082]  The Klan was her mentor.
[00:44:23.523 --> 00:44:24.304]  Why is it so funny?
[00:44:24.644 --> 00:44:26.426]  Alright, so why did you come up here to the protest?
[00:44:27.282 --> 00:44:31.868]  Uh, I was walking to class and I saw it when it was smaller here and then, uh, when I came back... Texas!
[00:44:32.328 --> 00:44:33.169]  Fight!
[00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:33.890]  Texas!
[00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:34.531]  Fight!
[00:44:34.551 --> 00:44:37.174]  See, that brings everyone together.
[00:44:37.855 --> 00:44:45.304]  Obviously, it's a very, very big, uh, pro-Hillary, anti-Trump rally.
[00:44:45.844 --> 00:44:47.645]  Earlier, you mentioned the people with masks.
[00:44:47.665 --> 00:44:48.926]  Do you know who those people are?
[00:44:49.487 --> 00:44:53.950]  From what I can tell, they're wearing keffiyehs, which generally come from the Middle East.
[00:44:53.970 --> 00:45:00.514]  A lot of Palestinian supporters wear them, because that's one of their... What if I told you it's the local Communist Party?
[00:45:01.054 --> 00:45:01.995]  Oh, I knew it was.
[00:45:02.475 --> 00:45:07.116]  Because, I mean, the pro-Palestinian group here on campus is very, very communist.
[00:45:07.477 --> 00:45:10.158]  I know a few people from classes that are involved with it.
[00:45:10.378 --> 00:45:11.758]  I think we can come together now.
[00:45:12.258 --> 00:45:13.739]  Donald Trump has said, make America great again.
[00:45:14.339 --> 00:45:15.680]  I think we can do that.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.981]  And this is going to involve everyone across the entire political spectrum.
[00:45:20.442 --> 00:45:23.543]  Left, right, communist, conservative.
[00:45:23.703 --> 00:45:26.164]  Everyone is going to have to work together to make this country great again.
[00:45:30.086 --> 00:45:34.616]  In fact, the majority of them actually believe they're going to be immediately deported.
[00:45:35.238 --> 00:45:36.681]  Trump, he's got to go!
[00:45:38.843 --> 00:45:43.186]  Because he does not represent this country.
[00:45:43.286 --> 00:45:50.790]  He is racist, xenophobic, and completely utter... Where are you from, my friend?
[00:45:51.431 --> 00:45:52.411]  I am from Houston.
[00:45:52.551 --> 00:45:53.952]  I am a Muslim American.
[00:45:54.072 --> 00:45:55.133]  You're an American?
[00:45:55.153 --> 00:45:55.793]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:55.934 --> 00:45:58.055]  I am a Muslim American.
[00:45:58.095 --> 00:46:01.237]  I do not deserve to be thrown out of this country.
[00:46:01.297 --> 00:46:02.698]  Well, of course you don't.
[00:46:03.698 --> 00:46:10.081]  What's the first thing that comes to mind?
[00:46:20.626 --> 00:46:39.421]  The local Communist Party that I spoke to here in Austin wouldn't speak back because they don't believe in free speech and frankly they're cowards.
[00:46:39.961 --> 00:46:42.203]  This entire march was a march of cowardice.
[00:46:42.843 --> 00:46:48.508]  As Obama, your leader, has explained to you, you must accept this peaceful transfer of power.
[00:46:49.108 --> 00:46:51.012]  And accept the resurrection of the U.S.
[00:46:51.072 --> 00:46:55.040]  Constitution and the Bill of Rights of which this country was founded on.
[00:46:55.481 --> 00:46:57.244]  John Bowne for Infowars.com

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.724]  I don't know.
[00:49:04.318 --> 00:49:07.340]  I'm Margaret Hall in studio with our nightly news director, Rob Dew.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.921]  We're going to be discussing Edward Snowden.
[00:49:08.961 --> 00:49:11.743]  He's going live 9.30 p.m.
[00:49:11.763 --> 00:49:13.704]  in the UK and Ireland, 4.30 p.m.
[00:49:13.744 --> 00:49:14.365]  Eastern here, 3.30 p.m.
[00:49:14.445 --> 00:49:15.846]  here in Austin for us.
[00:49:16.326 --> 00:49:21.329]  And we anticipate him, he's going to start talking about Donald Trump, the presidency and privacy.
[00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:28.954]  This is a live streamed event, of course, and exclusively he does these from a satellite transmission in Moscow.
[00:49:29.495 --> 00:49:31.936]  You know, Rob, can't wait to hear what he has to say.
[00:49:31.976 --> 00:49:34.238]  He's been kind of silent for the past few months.
[00:49:34.578 --> 00:49:35.098]  That's true.
[00:49:35.658 --> 00:49:57.666]  He did put out some stuff right before the election talking about with a $30 piece of equipment you can hack the election showing people that and I think we got the point across that yes our elections are not as safe and secure as they would like us to think they are and you know we should be moving I personally feel we should be moving towards paper ballots and the purple finger that way you can make sure these people only vote once and when I say these people I mean everybody.
[00:49:59.366 --> 00:50:08.510]  He is going to be talking, it says here, to an audience in Amsterdam via satellite from Moscow, where he's been there since, of course, 2013, on the run from the United States government.
[00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:11.271]  The big question is, will he ask Trump for a pardon?
[00:50:11.291 --> 00:50:13.412]  And I think that's probably the biggest thing.
[00:50:13.692 --> 00:50:18.614]  And if Trump pardons him, what does that say to other whistleblowers and his stance on whistleblowing in the future?
[00:50:19.175 --> 00:50:21.576]  Going on to the broader question here.
[00:50:22.739 --> 00:50:32.070]  I try not to look at this as a question of a single election or a single president or even a single government, right?
[00:50:32.887 --> 00:50:36.230]  Because we see these things, these threats coming across borders.
[00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.512]  We see the same thing happening in Russia.
[00:50:38.552 --> 00:50:41.634]  They've got this new surveillance law called the Yerevaya Package.
[00:50:41.694 --> 00:50:43.155]  Russians call it the Big Brother Law.
[00:50:43.836 --> 00:50:49.881]  In China, on the day of the election, the news was talking about how the Chinese had just passed a new mass surveillance law.
[00:50:50.281 --> 00:51:00.169]  And they got away with practically no criticism from the international community because they were clever enough to say that they had modeled it on the United States' own surveillance laws.
[00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:14.456]  And because our last two presidential administrations have been saying that these powers were so necessary, they were so valuable, and they didn't hurt anybody, now suddenly they can't criticize these other governments for doing the same thing.
[00:51:14.916 --> 00:51:15.977]  But this is a problem.
[00:51:16.977 --> 00:51:28.043]  Because even if you think, all right, well, you know, we want government to have authority and powers to be able to perform its legitimate tasks of securing the nation, of protecting our communities, of investigating crimes, right?
[00:51:29.291 --> 00:51:32.452]  But how is this done and where do they depart from this model?
[00:51:33.152 --> 00:51:52.259]  When do they start creating exceptions to what we have in the United States, our Fourth Amendment, which is an individual's right to privacy, where they say the government can't interfere in your communications, they can't arbitrarily investigate your home or take your letters or your emails, either collecting them or reading them.
[00:51:52.279 --> 00:51:52.979]  It's called the Fourth Amendment.
[00:51:52.999 --> 00:51:54.720]  Without going to a court and getting a warrant.
[00:51:55.902 --> 00:52:01.766]  But we have to recognize that even that barrier, the warrant requirement, the involvement of courts, doesn't mean the same thing in every country.
[00:52:02.267 --> 00:52:09.792]  This Internet that creates bonds of fraternity between people who don't even share the same language.
[00:52:10.133 --> 00:52:14.296]  But this, this fabric of communications.
[00:52:15.203 --> 00:52:20.607]  It was intended to empower citizens and individuals of communities and families.
[00:52:20.967 --> 00:52:21.307]  And it has.
[00:52:21.327 --> 00:52:23.688]  It's increasingly being used to disempower them.
[00:52:24.189 --> 00:52:25.089]  Right.
[00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:31.533]  Internet service providers, phone companies, governments and other corporations are beginning to spy on these things.
[00:52:31.553 --> 00:52:34.335]  They're lifting up that fabric to look at the lives underneath.
[00:52:34.495 --> 00:52:37.537]  How do you think Google knows what you're talking about and how to search?
[00:52:37.557 --> 00:52:39.358]  Oh, they're listening to us, aren't they?
[00:52:39.799 --> 00:52:43.261]  Or whether it's for, in some cases, legitimate purposes.
[00:52:44.853 --> 00:52:47.154]  But we have to think for ourselves.
[00:52:48.635 --> 00:52:52.156]  What if we start weaving this fabric in a slightly different way?
[00:52:52.896 --> 00:52:57.678]  What if we start changing that dynamic mechanism that we face in the status quo today?
[00:52:58.018 --> 00:53:10.864]  Which means when you pick up your phone and you make a call to your mother, your sister, your husband, your wife, that call is transiting that global network electronically.
[00:53:11.104 --> 00:53:12.004]  Anybody can look at it.
[00:53:12.064 --> 00:53:12.905]  Anybody can listen to it.
[00:53:12.965 --> 00:53:13.745]  Anybody can read it.
[00:53:14.682 --> 00:53:18.845]  What if we change that so that it's protected by default?
[00:53:19.285 --> 00:53:23.368]  Every communication, every transaction you engage with is protected.
[00:53:24.028 --> 00:53:25.489]  And you don't have to take some activity.
[00:53:25.509 --> 00:53:32.134]  You don't have to teach a journalist how to use this sophisticated encryption program, even if it is 20 years old.
[00:53:32.174 --> 00:53:35.476]  And you know, you hope that people should be able to get to use it at this point.
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:46.843]  Instead, we made this fabric work not just for Americans, not just for people in the Netherlands, but for the whole world.
[00:53:47.224 --> 00:54:00.149]  If suddenly we could not just support the human rights of people in Germany, France, Brazil, Iran, Russia, China, and America, we could enforce them.
[00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:03.410]  We could guarantee them through our technology.
[00:54:08.206 --> 00:54:13.608]  Well folks, the protests for Donald Trump were ongoing for the last year and a half to try to keep him out of office.
[00:54:13.948 --> 00:54:14.629]  They failed.
[00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:21.092]  But the losers are continuing to go back to their failed techniques and they're still protesting Donald Trump.
[00:54:21.412 --> 00:54:26.354]  And believe it or not, it's actually gotten worse and more shocking.
[00:54:26.894 --> 00:54:28.935]  Here's some of the highlights of what we've seen so far.
[00:54:30.883 --> 00:54:32.284]  No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!
[00:54:32.785 --> 00:54:33.686]  No Trump, no KKK,
[00:55:00.984 --> 00:55:01.825]  Racists go home!
[00:55:02.105 --> 00:55:03.886]  Racists go home!
[00:55:03.946 --> 00:55:05.627]  Black lives matter!
[00:55:05.807 --> 00:55:08.929]  Black lives matter!
[00:55:08.989 --> 00:55:11.190]  Black lives matter!
[00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:12.671]  Black lives matter!
[00:55:12.751 --> 00:55:14.693]  Hey, alright, so you keep telling people not to talk to us.
[00:55:14.713 --> 00:55:14.973]  Why?
[00:55:14.993 --> 00:55:16.854]  Why can't people talk to us?
[00:55:16.874 --> 00:55:18.815]  Now you can't talk?
[00:55:18.895 --> 00:55:20.236]  Hey, but why aren't we back?
[00:55:26.805 --> 00:55:29.447]  Why aren't you guys both not wanting to talk to us?
[00:55:29.487 --> 00:55:30.868]  Because you're a fascist.
[00:55:31.049 --> 00:55:31.669]  I'm a fascist?
[00:55:31.709 --> 00:55:32.269]  How so?
[00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:33.691]  Just explain it to me.
[00:55:33.711 --> 00:55:35.032]  You work for Infowars?
[00:55:35.052 --> 00:55:36.573]  I'm just running camera here.
[00:55:36.813 --> 00:55:37.934]  You work for Infowars?
[00:55:37.954 --> 00:55:39.155]  I work for Infowars, yeah.
[00:55:39.175 --> 00:55:39.955]  You work for Infowars?
[00:55:39.975 --> 00:55:40.796]  You work for a fascist?
[00:55:40.816 --> 00:55:41.436]  Alex Jones a fascist?
[00:55:41.476 --> 00:55:41.977]  But how?
[00:55:42.577 --> 00:55:42.777]  How?
[00:55:44.879 --> 00:55:45.780]  I don't talk to fascists.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.321]  I'm not a fascist.
[00:55:47.341 --> 00:55:48.782]  Why can't we have an open dialogue?
[00:55:48.982 --> 00:55:50.163]  I don't talk to fascists.
[00:55:50.223 --> 00:55:50.563]  Why not?
[00:55:51.044 --> 00:55:52.205]  I don't talk to fascists.
[00:55:52.265 --> 00:55:53.526]  I'll talk to you, whatever you are.
[00:55:53.586 --> 00:55:54.887]  I don't talk to fascists.
[00:55:55.527 --> 00:55:57.308]  Alright, I'm a fascist apparently.
[00:55:57.468 --> 00:55:58.688]  This guy doesn't know me at all.
[00:55:58.908 --> 00:56:00.449]  Oh my God, I didn't see you.
[00:56:00.489 --> 00:56:02.150]  Look at this guy, this guy just assaulted me.
[00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:04.471]  Look at this guy.
[00:56:04.531 --> 00:56:05.851]  Hey, this guy, Joe Biggs.
[00:56:06.411 --> 00:56:08.952]  This guy over here just assaulted me.
[00:56:09.132 --> 00:56:10.533]  Look at the people.
[00:56:10.573 --> 00:56:11.953]  You know that guy?
[00:56:12.033 --> 00:56:13.094]  No, not you, not you.
[00:56:14.134 --> 00:56:14.775]  Over here.
[00:56:15.335 --> 00:56:17.856]  Look, right here, with his face covered, because he's a coward.
[00:56:18.576 --> 00:56:20.036]  They're so peaceful!
[00:56:20.196 --> 00:56:21.277]  They're so peaceful!
[00:56:21.337 --> 00:56:22.177]  They're so peaceful!
[00:56:22.197 --> 00:56:23.337]  They're so peaceful!
[00:56:23.397 --> 00:56:25.958]  That's what you get when you're a communist.
[00:56:25.998 --> 00:56:28.998]  They're a bunch of cowardly f***ing scumbags.
[00:56:39.761 --> 00:56:47.306]  I bet the guy that kicked Josh in the back, the guy that was wearing the mask, was probably the same guy that accused Josh of being a coward.
[00:56:47.346 --> 00:56:50.488]  That's the kind of projection that these liberals do, right?
[00:56:50.508 --> 00:56:51.249]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was.
[00:56:51.489 --> 00:56:53.050]  Yeah, okay, it was, yeah.
[00:56:53.090 --> 00:57:01.035]  You guys going down there in this crowd of maniacs who are screaming and kicking people in the back and you're wearing a Trump shirt, that's anything but a coward.
[00:57:01.235 --> 00:57:04.398]  But a coward is somebody that kicks someone in the back, but that's what we see with these people.
[00:57:04.758 --> 00:57:07.940]  They project their faults on other people just like Hillary Clinton did.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:12.841]  They're racist and so they call you a racist because all they see is skin color.
[00:57:24.225 --> 00:57:26.147]  Yeah, you just told me to leave.
[00:57:26.247 --> 00:57:27.728]  Get the f**k out of here.
[00:57:27.868 --> 00:57:28.569]  This is a f**king protest.
[00:57:28.589 --> 00:57:30.290]  This is my f**king area as well.
[00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:31.631]  This is my street.
[00:57:31.651 --> 00:57:33.413]  You f**king piece of s**t racist.
[00:57:33.613 --> 00:57:34.593]  Oh yeah.
[00:57:34.774 --> 00:57:36.675]  You know I got xenophobe too, right?
[00:57:37.276 --> 00:57:38.036]  Homophobic.
[00:57:38.056 --> 00:57:38.997]  Let me get all that too.
[00:57:39.097 --> 00:57:40.278]  That's f**king true.
[00:57:40.358 --> 00:57:41.199]  How is he racist?
[00:57:41.499 --> 00:57:41.819]  How?
[00:57:41.939 --> 00:57:42.219]  Yeah.
[00:57:42.339 --> 00:57:42.900]  F***ing Trump!
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.581]  Do you see what Trump's doing?
[00:57:44.601 --> 00:57:45.661]  Do you see what he supports?
[00:57:46.142 --> 00:57:47.742]  Like, I don't even want to bother with y'all.
[00:57:47.762 --> 00:57:48.243]  I don't f***ing know.
[00:57:48.303 --> 00:57:51.244]  No, no, I honestly, I honestly, Hey, I honestly want to know.
[00:57:51.264 --> 00:57:51.845]  I honestly want to know.
[00:57:51.865 --> 00:57:53.386]  Get the f*** out of here, dude.
[00:57:53.406 --> 00:57:54.566]  Dude, this is a public street.
[00:57:54.986 --> 00:57:57.828]  This is a public street, man.
[00:57:57.848 --> 00:57:59.949]  This is your problem, is that you don't want to talk to anyone.
[00:58:00.149 --> 00:58:01.470]  There's no point.
[00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:02.811]  I'm not a racist.
[00:58:02.831 --> 00:58:03.671]  That's f***ed up.
[00:58:03.691 --> 00:58:04.352]  I'm not a racist.
[00:58:04.372 --> 00:58:05.612]  You got Trump in the office.
[00:58:06.693 --> 00:58:07.433]  I got Trump in the office.
[00:58:07.453 --> 00:58:08.114]  But you vote for Trump.
[00:58:08.754 --> 00:58:10.195]  I'm not here to talk about who voted for who.
[00:58:11.896 --> 00:58:13.197]  All I did was ask you why you're here.
[00:58:13.237 --> 00:58:14.118]  This is about the presidency.
[00:58:14.178 --> 00:58:16.439]  Get the f*** out of here if you don't... He's already president!
[00:58:16.459 --> 00:58:17.340]  You're not going to change it!
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:18.541]  I'm not trying to change it!
[00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:19.441]  You're not going to change it!
[00:58:19.481 --> 00:58:20.522]  I know I'm not!
[00:58:20.582 --> 00:58:21.463]  He's the f***ing president!
[00:58:21.503 --> 00:58:22.404]  Like, no s***!
[00:58:22.484 --> 00:58:23.044]  F***ing dumbass!
[00:58:23.064 --> 00:58:24.965]  So what are you trying to do?
[00:58:25.025 --> 00:58:26.106]  What are you trying to do?
[00:58:26.446 --> 00:58:29.589]  We're protesting the fact that he got f***ing elected!
[00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:31.670]  Like, no s***!
[00:58:33.416 --> 00:58:34.357]  So there you go, folks.
[00:58:34.397 --> 00:58:39.961]  Those are the people that want to control this country's destiny and be in charge of our future.
[00:58:40.501 --> 00:58:41.102]  No thanks.
[00:58:41.402 --> 00:58:46.586]  In fact, if you guys wanted to go ahead and move out of this country with Amy Schumer and the like, be my guest.
[00:58:46.766 --> 00:58:48.247]  I'll even buy your plane ticket.
[00:58:48.587 --> 00:58:51.330]  Thanks so much for everybody who tuned in to the news tonight.
