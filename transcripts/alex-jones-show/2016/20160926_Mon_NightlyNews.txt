[00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:14.543]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:21.905]  Join us for our live coverage of the upcoming debate between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton on September 26th.
[00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:29.107]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show for all the live coverage and also go to the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:30.567]  Will Hillary wear an earpiece?
[00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:37.408]  Will Donald Trump and Hillary actually be on the same stage or will they try to do another forum like we've seen before?
[00:00:37.448 --> 00:00:39.749]  This is all going to be leading up to our
[00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:41.949]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:23.504]  Every globalist New World Order publication has said, if Hillary falls and fails, it's the beginning of the end of their corporate world government.
[00:02:23.764 --> 00:02:25.845]  We've seen the Brexit, a death blow to the New World Order.
[00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:27.725]  We've seen Russia pulling out of globalism.
[00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:34.047]  And now, if the United States of America votes for Donald Trump, that is a massive signal that it's
[00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:38.150]  The beginning of the end of this new world order system.
[00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.754]  The first of the presidential debates will take place at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.
[00:02:44.354 --> 00:02:53.220]  90 minutes, moderated by NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt, with a possible record-breaking 100 million plus viewers predicted to tune in.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.323]  The debate has already become a reality TV show spectacle.
[00:02:57.503 --> 00:03:13.078]  With Hillary again possibly having an earpiece, along with being given a customized podium so that Trump doesn't tower over her while she potentially hacks away for four minutes, as has happened at recent campaign rallies.
[00:03:13.278 --> 00:03:18.543]  Hillary cheerleader and Trump troll Mark Cuban accepted the Clinton campaign's invitation
[00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:20.484]  To sit in the front row of the debate.
[00:03:20.664 --> 00:03:27.429]  Donald Trump responded in a tweet with, Dopey Mark Cuban of failed benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row.
[00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.971]  Perhaps I will put Jennifer Flowers right alongside him.
[00:03:31.131 --> 00:03:37.935]  Flowers appeared to have accepted the invitation, tweeting, Hi Donald, you know I'm in your corner and will definitely be at the debate.
[00:03:38.015 --> 00:03:42.098]  However, the Trump campaign is denying that Flowers will be in attendance.
[00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:47.001]  Flowers conducted a 12 year affair with then Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton.
[00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:48.582]  But wouldn't that be something?
[00:03:48.723 --> 00:03:52.887]  Why not load up the debate audience with all of the people damaged by the Clinton Mafia?
[00:03:53.068 --> 00:03:57.533]  The American Mirror reports Juanita Broderick would be happy to be in attendance saying,
[00:04:02.278 --> 00:04:03.660]  Just what she would say to Clinton.
[00:04:18.562 --> 00:04:21.603]  I wish I could say I was going, but haven't been invited.
[00:04:21.883 --> 00:04:30.145]  Yet another Clinton victim, former White House aide Kathleen Willey, commented that you could fill the entire audience with Bill Clinton's alleged sex assault victims.
[00:04:30.566 --> 00:04:42.049]  Breitbart reports, Willey stated, the real story here is not one of our presence in the front row at any of these debates, but the unhindered lust for power that the Clintons have displayed for decades.
[00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.510]  Hillary Clinton has lied, cheated, and stolen our lives from us.
[00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:48.831]  People have died in her wake of deceit.
[00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:50.812]  We could fill the entire audience.
[00:04:50.892 --> 00:05:03.777]  I would like to see the day when these women can step into the light and share their stories of brutality, terror, and intimidation without the kind of fear of intimidation and recrimination that we have experienced for far too many years.
[00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:10.579]  You could actually fill an entire country with all of the victims of the Clinton Foundation's pay-for-play deviance.
[00:05:10.859 --> 00:05:20.521]  Or the tens of thousands killed in Libya, Egypt, Iraq, and Syria in the wake of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's globalist-backed takedown of the Middle East.
[00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:34.385]  Not to mention those who died in the towers on 9-11, whose deaths recent findings have discovered have ties to the Saudi Arabian Wahhabist Islamic terror funding group Hillary aide Huma Abedin worked for during 9-11.
[00:05:35.325 --> 00:05:46.232]  Or the families of all the victims silenced by the Clinton crime family as Bill and Hillary and company tore down a road paved with avarice as it draws nearer to the Oval Office.
[00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:48.474]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:05:53.857 --> 00:05:55.978]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:55.998 --> 00:06:02.683]  Well, if you want to know about all the countries that Hillary Clinton has single-handedly destroyed, look no further than our website, InfoWars.com.
[00:06:02.703 --> 00:06:06.545]  There's an article up online, right now it's trending, written by Wayne Madsen.
[00:06:06.565 --> 00:06:12.009]  Wayne's going to be on Alex Jones Show later today, and then the nightly news tonight with Owen Schroer.
[00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:13.650]  I want to take you through what he said.
[00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.992]  I encourage you to take a look at this 11-page article in its entirety.
[00:06:17.032 --> 00:06:17.732]  It's amazing.
[00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:21.755]  It's entitled, here's a handy chart of Clinton's world destruction.
[00:06:21.775 --> 00:06:23.096]  And then he goes on to write about what
[00:06:23.536 --> 00:06:26.637]  What Secretary of State Colin Powell had written about Hillary Clinton.
[00:06:27.037 --> 00:06:30.378]  He basically said everything she touches turns to you-know-what.
[00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:32.458]  He said she screws up everything with hubris.
[00:06:32.838 --> 00:06:40.340]  And then Madsen gives this brilliant detailed list of every country that she's been involved in and single-handedly what she's done to them.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:48.722]  You know, Madsen talks about as Clinton as Secretary of State she threatened Belarus, Ecuador, Bolivia, Cuba, Somalia, Uzbekistan and Peru.
[00:06:49.162 --> 00:06:52.783]  With recriminations if they recognized a state that she was trying to ignore.
[00:06:53.343 --> 00:07:03.347]  He talks about her involvement in Libya, the gun aspect of what she did on the ground in Libya, what she's done in Syria, and what her actions have done that have led to the creation of ISIS.
[00:07:03.387 --> 00:07:07.068]  So we're talking about a woman that is on a major power trip right now.
[00:07:07.168 --> 00:07:11.730]  She wants the highest office in our land, and yet look at her track record.
[00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.070]  She screws up everything she touches.
[00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.311]  Can you only imagine
[00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:21.154]  The foreign policy regime that we're going to have if she gets her hands on the keys to the White House.
[00:07:21.194 --> 00:07:29.378]  Now, Wayne Mattson goes on to talk about how Clinton's involvement in the Arab Spring resulted in the rise of Sunni Wahhabism and the Islamic State.
[00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:36.701]  Basically, she had a hand in the creation of ISIS in northern and western Iraq, and Iraq's plunge and dissension into hell.
[00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:40.163]  He goes on to talk about in 2009 her involvement in Kosovo,
[00:07:40.923 --> 00:07:49.466]  Uh, which led to the state increasingly becoming a state ruled by criminal syndicates and terrorists and former, uh, Liberation Army officials, which we know are basically terrorists.
[00:07:49.986 --> 00:07:52.067]  So we need to take a look at Hillary Clinton's record.
[00:07:52.107 --> 00:07:55.068]  She has a lengthy past full of crimes.
[00:07:55.188 --> 00:07:57.829]  I encourage you, go to our website, take a look at this article.

[00:08:15.623 --> 00:08:24.735]  There can now be no doubt the dinosaur establishment corporate media that represents the Republicans and Democrats in this nation is in free fall.
[00:08:25.415 --> 00:08:33.145]  And Donald Trump is simply a focal point or a bellwether illustrating the fact that nationalism and populism is rising.
[00:08:33.926 --> 00:08:44.596]  And at the heart of this fight is InfoWars.com and my syndicated radio broadcast and nightly news transmission, as well as our films, the news articles that our great investigative journalists write every day.
[00:08:45.117 --> 00:08:48.680]  And of course, you the listeners and viewers of InfoWars.

[00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:09.733]  Info warriors of every race, color, and creed who have red blood coursing through their veins are unified by their love of basic liberty and human empowerment.
[00:09:11.087 --> 00:09:17.271]  You are the individuals that have bought the high-quality products at InfoWarsStore.com over the years and supported our sponsors.
[00:09:17.672 --> 00:09:31.161]  And that's why to mark this historic debate with roughly 100 million viewers set to tune in, we are going to offer, before, during, and after our coverage, free shipping store-wide at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:42.127]  InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:09:43.147 --> 00:09:47.610]  I've been involved with supplements and nutraceuticals for almost my entire career in media.
[00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:57.055]  And in the last five years, since we launched InfoWars Life, we have had thousands of emails and callers ask, why don't you have a probiotic?
[00:09:57.415 --> 00:10:01.197]  The jewel in the crown of any nutraceutical lineup.
[00:10:01.717 --> 00:10:02.598]  And the answer is simple.
[00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:18.067]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality, known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[00:10:44.947 --> 00:10:51.653]  And so that's why we didn't give viewers and listeners some quick fix or private label some other probiotic that was out there.
[00:10:52.093 --> 00:11:02.057]  We went out and worked for year after year after year with the top experts to produce the ultimate fusion of proven probiotics at an extremely affordable price.

[00:11:28.957 --> 00:11:29.717]  Let's go find out.
[00:11:30.477 --> 00:11:32.759]  Are you guys gonna be watching the presidential debate tomorrow night?
[00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:33.339]  Absolutely.
[00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:34.940]  What are you looking forward to?
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.621]  Trump going over to Hillary.
[00:11:38.584 --> 00:11:39.244]  What about you, ma'am?
[00:11:39.905 --> 00:11:40.965]  I don't care, honestly.
[00:11:40.985 --> 00:11:42.026]  Um, no.
[00:11:42.707 --> 00:11:43.367]  You're not gonna watch it?
[00:11:43.707 --> 00:11:44.187]  No.
[00:11:44.207 --> 00:11:45.088]  Are you eligible to vote?
[00:11:45.468 --> 00:11:46.089]  No.
[00:11:47.009 --> 00:11:47.509]  Are you, ma'am?
[00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.290]  No, sorry.
[00:11:49.311 --> 00:11:51.312]  Are you guys eligible to vote?
[00:11:51.772 --> 00:11:52.032]  Yeah.
[00:11:52.332 --> 00:11:53.153]  But you won't watch the debate?
[00:11:53.273 --> 00:11:53.553]  No.
[00:11:53.733 --> 00:11:54.233]  Are you gonna vote?
[00:11:54.794 --> 00:11:55.294]  I don't know yet.
[00:11:55.334 --> 00:11:57.455]  Are you gonna watch the presidential debate tomorrow?
[00:11:57.836 --> 00:11:58.016]  No.
[00:11:58.436 --> 00:11:58.596]  Nope.
[00:11:59.297 --> 00:11:59.897]  Not gonna watch?
[00:12:02.312 --> 00:12:04.133]  They're going to be too busy trying to find their clothes.
[00:12:04.794 --> 00:12:06.635]  Are you going to watch the presidential debate tomorrow night?
[00:12:06.975 --> 00:12:07.696]  Yeah, sure.
[00:12:07.976 --> 00:12:08.816]  I want to see who wins.
[00:12:09.237 --> 00:12:10.718]  What are you looking forward to the most?
[00:12:11.624 --> 00:12:12.504]  Seeing somebody lose.
[00:12:13.445 --> 00:12:15.146]  Seeing somebody... What do you mean by lose?
[00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:16.366]  Just making a fool of themselves?
[00:12:16.746 --> 00:12:18.127]  I don't want anybody to be president.
[00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:19.128]  I'm voting for Snoop Dogg.
[00:12:20.028 --> 00:12:20.688]  Alright, Snoop Dogg.
[00:12:20.848 --> 00:12:21.469]  What about you, sir?
[00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:22.729]  Are you gonna watch the presidential debate?
[00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:24.470]  Ah, fuck Hillary and fuck Donald Trump.
[00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.551]  They can both suck my dick.
[00:12:25.731 --> 00:12:26.371]  Wash his face.
[00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:28.272]  Wash him with the wig, the hair.
[00:12:28.492 --> 00:12:28.672]  Trump?
[00:12:28.772 --> 00:12:29.753]  No, no way.
[00:12:29.813 --> 00:12:30.533]  You don't like Trump?
[00:12:30.633 --> 00:12:31.353]  No, he's an idiot.
[00:12:32.154 --> 00:12:32.434]  Yes.
[00:12:32.854 --> 00:12:34.315]  What are you looking forward to the most?
[00:12:36.876 --> 00:12:37.736]  I don't know what to say.
[00:12:39.197 --> 00:12:40.778]  You say what I like about the president?
[00:12:41.613 --> 00:12:43.214]  What do you think is going to happen during the debate?
[00:12:43.234 --> 00:12:45.335]  Do you think someone is going to make a fool of themselves?
[00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:46.755]  Or do you think it will be good for America?
[00:12:48.096 --> 00:12:52.177]  I think the one that will be good for America is Hillary Clinton.
[00:12:52.537 --> 00:12:53.878]  That's the one I like.
[00:12:54.518 --> 00:12:56.479]  So you're looking for Hillary Clinton to make some strong statements?
[00:12:56.839 --> 00:12:57.119]  Yes.
[00:12:57.459 --> 00:12:58.400]  Of course, yes.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.840]  What are you looking forward to?
[00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:08.544]  I'm from Mexico and I don't want to win Donald Trump so I want to watch Hillary have many things to say to Donald.
[00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:11.205]  So you're looking for some immigration talk?
[00:13:11.565 --> 00:13:12.106]  No, no, no.
[00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:17.811]  Only because we don't want to build that wall that Trump says.
[00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.053]  Are you going to watch the presidential debate tomorrow night?
[00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:23.116]  If somebody changes our country.
[00:13:24.758 --> 00:13:28.121]  Okay, but debate's tomorrow night, so you got 24 hours.
[00:13:28.381 --> 00:13:29.542]  I don't know if much is going to change.
[00:13:29.562 --> 00:13:30.203]  You think you'll tune in?
[00:13:31.246 --> 00:13:31.686]  I don't know.
[00:13:31.926 --> 00:13:32.787]  This country sucks.
[00:13:32.887 --> 00:13:36.008]  Hey, I just ran into Laura Loomer from Project Veritas.
[00:13:36.068 --> 00:13:38.348]  Laura, what are you looking forward to in the debate tomorrow?
[00:13:38.648 --> 00:13:51.953]  Well, it's definitely going to be the most anticipated presidential debate in history and I'm looking forward to a lot of the investigations that have been uncovered in the past year and a half being brought to light and some bombastic dialogue between both candidates.
[00:13:52.493 --> 00:13:54.673]  Are you guys going to watch the presidential debate tomorrow night?
[00:13:55.194 --> 00:13:55.874]  Yes, we will.
[00:13:56.094 --> 00:13:56.534]  Yeah, of course.
[00:13:57.794 --> 00:13:59.375]  What are you looking forward to the most?
[00:14:00.594 --> 00:14:03.077]  Uh, see what comes out of Donald Trump's mouth.
[00:14:03.598 --> 00:14:05.601]  You mean, like, what stupidity comes out of his mouth?
[00:14:05.982 --> 00:14:07.003]  Not necessarily.
[00:14:07.604 --> 00:14:08.365]  What about you, ma'am?
[00:14:08.425 --> 00:14:09.066]  Same thing.
[00:14:09.267 --> 00:14:10.689]  I'm just kinda waiting.
[00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.533]  So you're looking forward to hear what Donald Trump has to say, though?
[00:14:13.974 --> 00:14:15.075]  Oh, yes I am, yeah.
[00:14:15.456 --> 00:14:15.896]  Both of them.
[00:14:16.857 --> 00:14:17.817]  What are you guys expecting?
[00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.818]  Fireworks or a calm debate for once?
[00:14:19.878 --> 00:14:20.979]  No, more fireworks.
[00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:21.779]  More like fireworks.
[00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:25.081]  Probably similar to the Republican debates when they had them.
[00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:26.781]  Seems to be a lot of name-calling.
[00:14:27.342 --> 00:14:28.442]  No, I don't think so.
[00:14:28.882 --> 00:14:29.242]  Why not?
[00:14:30.103 --> 00:14:31.303]  Not interested.
[00:14:31.383 --> 00:14:31.984]  What about you, sir?
[00:14:32.804 --> 00:14:33.004]  No.
[00:14:33.584 --> 00:14:34.125]  Not interested?
[00:14:34.285 --> 00:14:34.745]  Not interested.
[00:14:34.785 --> 00:14:35.725]  Where are you from?
[00:14:36.165 --> 00:14:36.466]  France.
[00:14:36.986 --> 00:14:39.227]  Do you think this election is going to affect the entire world?
[00:14:39.387 --> 00:14:39.687]  Oh, yes.
[00:14:40.367 --> 00:14:40.647]  Oh, yes.
[00:14:41.028 --> 00:14:41.768]  Who are you polling for?
[00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:49.880]  I'm not really sure I like either choice.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.560]  No, I don't think so, probably not.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.900]  What about you?
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:54.601]  No.
[00:14:54.941 --> 00:14:56.161]  Are you guys eligible to vote?
[00:14:56.881 --> 00:14:56.941]  No.
[00:14:56.981 --> 00:14:57.501]  Yeah, I am.
[00:14:58.221 --> 00:14:58.981]  But you're not going to watch?
[00:15:00.662 --> 00:15:03.062]  No, but I probably will vote, though, yeah.
[00:15:03.482 --> 00:15:03.822]  No!
[00:15:04.662 --> 00:15:05.042]  Why not?
[00:15:07.543 --> 00:15:09.223]  I'd rather find something else to do.
[00:15:10.423 --> 00:15:11.703]  Like something else on TV, or?
[00:15:12.264 --> 00:15:14.504]  Politics and religion is hard to discuss.
[00:15:15.894 --> 00:15:17.615]  So you just want to avoid them both altogether?
[00:15:18.636 --> 00:15:20.738]  Yeah, well, I like Clinton.
[00:15:21.999 --> 00:15:24.581]  If I vote, I am a voter registered.
[00:15:25.721 --> 00:15:26.722]  I'll vote for Clinton.
[00:15:26.742 --> 00:15:29.024]  Are you going to watch the presidential debate tomorrow night?
[00:15:29.264 --> 00:15:29.765]  I'm not.
[00:15:30.505 --> 00:15:31.526]  Are you eligible to vote?
[00:15:32.026 --> 00:15:33.247]  No, I'm not.
[00:15:34.228 --> 00:15:35.709]  I wouldn't vote either way, really.
[00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:37.070]  So you're not going to watch, though?
[00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.630]  No.
[00:15:37.991 --> 00:15:38.731]  Where are you from?
[00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:39.592]  Mexico.
[00:15:39.912 --> 00:15:40.192]  And you?
[00:15:41.293 --> 00:15:41.714]  The same.
[00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:43.395]  Who do you guys want to win?
[00:15:44.651 --> 00:15:45.691]  Hillary, of course.
[00:15:46.151 --> 00:15:47.712]  Yeah, for Hillary.
[00:15:47.772 --> 00:15:48.752]  Why is that an of course?
[00:15:49.352 --> 00:16:00.276]  Because all of us know how strong and bad person that has been.
[00:16:00.936 --> 00:16:02.436]  Yeah, I don't like his ideas.
[00:16:02.636 --> 00:16:03.897]  I like really bad.
[00:16:04.017 --> 00:16:04.197]  Yeah.
[00:16:04.537 --> 00:16:07.400]  So you don't like the fact that we're going to take some of that money back from you guys?
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.562]  No, and that's not true!
[00:16:09.982 --> 00:16:11.804]  I mean... Are you going to pay for the wall?
[00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:13.525]  No!
[00:16:14.226 --> 00:16:15.888]  That's a bad joke, really.
[00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:16.708]  Really bad joke.
[00:16:16.728 --> 00:16:17.649]  You're going to pay for the wall?
[00:16:17.989 --> 00:16:19.291]  No, we're not!
[00:16:19.351 --> 00:16:20.452]  No, no, no.
[00:16:20.872 --> 00:16:21.333]  Never.
[00:16:21.973 --> 00:16:23.935]  Are you guys going to watch the presidential debate tomorrow?
[00:16:24.195 --> 00:16:24.595]  Absolutely.
[00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:25.937]  What are you looking forward to?
[00:16:26.937 --> 00:16:29.179]  I'm looking forward to see them square off.
[00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:32.341]  I want to see... It's an important decision.
[00:16:33.382 --> 00:16:35.684]  And I think she's going to kick his butt, so I want to see that happen.
[00:16:35.884 --> 00:16:37.225]  You're expecting a Hillary victory?
[00:16:37.626 --> 00:16:38.386]  Yeah, I am.
[00:16:38.887 --> 00:16:40.468]  I also vote for Trump.
[00:16:40.628 --> 00:16:41.229]  Where are you from?
[00:16:41.929 --> 00:16:42.369]  New York.
[00:16:42.429 --> 00:16:43.290]  Money makes money.
[00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.311]  Trump is the way to go.
[00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:45.172]  Thank you.
[00:16:46.953 --> 00:16:48.654]  Are you going to watch the presidential debate tomorrow?
[00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:51.417]  Who are you polling for?
[00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:52.598]  Oh yeah, of course.
[00:16:52.638 --> 00:16:53.458]  I'm definitely watching it.
[00:16:53.478 --> 00:16:54.739]  What are you looking forward to?
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:55.380]  Trump.
[00:16:56.741 --> 00:16:57.362]  Just Trump?
[00:16:57.582 --> 00:16:57.782]  Yeah.
[00:16:58.002 --> 00:16:58.703]  Just kicking butt?
[00:16:58.943 --> 00:16:59.323]  That's it.
[00:16:59.403 --> 00:17:00.644]  All I know is I hope he wins.
[00:17:00.664 --> 00:17:01.285]  That's all I care.
[00:17:01.685 --> 00:17:03.707]  So we just heard from the people in New York City.
[00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:05.528]  Are they going to watch the presidential debate?
[00:17:05.988 --> 00:17:07.370]  Most of them seemed uninterested.
[00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.330]  Some of them said yes.
[00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.171]  Some of them said no.
[00:17:09.251 --> 00:17:11.012]  But really not that much excitement.
[00:17:11.092 --> 00:17:12.974]  Not as much as I feel.
[00:17:13.034 --> 00:17:14.315]  Not as much as we expected.
[00:17:14.555 --> 00:17:17.998]  We are expecting this to be the best rated presidential debate ever.
[00:17:18.238 --> 00:17:20.340]  But if you were going around the streets asking people about it,
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.781]  Not that much excitement.
[00:17:21.821 --> 00:17:23.542]  Doesn't really seem to be on people's minds.
[00:17:23.863 --> 00:17:26.745]  Remember, download the InfoWars Live app.
[00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:30.608]  You can watch all of our coverage live on the InfoWars Live app.
[00:17:30.768 --> 00:17:33.210]  We'll have complete coverage of this debate tomorrow night.
[00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.231]  InfoWars.com slash show.
[00:17:42.338 --> 00:17:46.621]  November 12th, fighting Rashad Evans in New York at Madison Square Gardens.
[00:17:46.782 --> 00:17:48.843]  I'm coming to not only win, but to dominate.
[00:17:48.923 --> 00:17:56.569]  I need to make an exclamation mark to the entire division that I have been and I still am the best fighter in that division.
[00:17:56.929 --> 00:17:58.271]  I have two months to get ready for the fight.
[00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:00.993]  I'm going to go to Albuquerque, New Mexico to Jackson Winklejohn MMA.
[00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:06.257]  We're actually going to bring some cameras from Infowars to film some of my fight camp.
[00:18:06.617 --> 00:18:07.217]  When you're training,
[00:18:08.478 --> 00:18:12.459]  You're training 90-minute sessions once, twice, three times a day.
[00:18:12.919 --> 00:18:14.880]  There's one day a week that I only have one workout.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.700]  All the other days are two or three times.
[00:18:17.081 --> 00:18:21.062]  I use Super Mayo Vitality when I am tired, when I'm broken.
[00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:26.423]  It's those things, it's these supplements that kick me into the next gear so I can have another training session.
[00:18:26.583 --> 00:18:28.144]  It's cold-pressed, known herbs.
[00:18:28.204 --> 00:18:28.904]  I didn't develop this.
[00:18:28.924 --> 00:18:31.625]  The top herbologist, Dr. Grip of the country.
[00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:32.405]  It's the best.
[00:18:32.785 --> 00:18:36.087]  It's like sold in medical clinics, but it doesn't copy testosterone.
[00:18:36.327 --> 00:18:39.610]  It only gets your body to release the hormones you already have.
[00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:45.874]  And what I'm told is it actually blocks estrogen mimickers that are in all the plastics and crap, so it brings you more to your natural state.
[00:18:45.994 --> 00:18:48.936]  What's in the things that I'm taking are real herbs.
[00:18:48.996 --> 00:18:52.358]  This is real food that I'm taking before workouts and after workouts.
[00:18:52.378 --> 00:18:53.019]  Totally natural.
[00:18:53.139 --> 00:18:56.781]  Totally natural to feel better and to be the most elite athlete on the planet.
[00:18:56.821 --> 00:19:00.264]  And by the way, years ago, you and Shane were going out and getting raw milk.
[00:19:00.384 --> 00:19:02.025]  You were getting your vegetables from the Amish.
[00:19:02.165 --> 00:19:02.825]  Go buy the product.
[00:19:02.925 --> 00:19:03.366]  I believe in it.
[00:19:03.486 --> 00:19:04.506]  It is, it's the real deal.
[00:19:04.666 --> 00:19:05.587]  I mean, look at me.
[00:19:05.607 --> 00:19:08.909]  I mean, I'm no Ted Kennedy, but 70 pounds I've lost.
[00:19:09.189 --> 00:19:09.629]  You feel it.
[00:19:09.689 --> 00:19:10.250]  You notice it.
[00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.311]  And I'm still getting faster.
[00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:13.312]  I'm still getting stronger.
[00:19:13.772 --> 00:19:16.373]  You know, I'm still getting, becoming harder to kill every day.
[00:19:16.393 --> 00:19:22.637]  With Super Mel Vitality, X2 and other products, it's helped me lose over 70 pounds of fricking fat.
[00:19:22.717 --> 00:19:23.117]  I like it.
[00:19:23.177 --> 00:19:26.979]  You know, is it evil of me that I don't want Hillary's camp to start using any of our supplements?
[00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:27.799]  Because she might actually
[00:19:43.945 --> 00:19:44.806]  Get a little healthier.
[00:19:44.866 --> 00:19:48.969]  You know, we thought of that as a joke to send her some super female vitality and people said, well, wait, we don't want to help her.
[00:19:49.009 --> 00:19:49.730]  It might actually help her.
[00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.451]  No, but really it affects change.
[00:19:51.711 --> 00:19:54.213]  I take super male vitality every single day.
[00:19:54.873 --> 00:19:55.274]  I love it.
[00:19:55.554 --> 00:19:56.194]  My wife loves it.
[00:19:57.035 --> 00:19:59.617]  My coaches love it because I have energy nonstop.
[00:19:59.937 --> 00:20:01.659]  There's a foundation to being an athlete.
[00:20:02.199 --> 00:20:04.460]  No, there's kind of the four cornerstones.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.521]  You gotta have healthy sleep.
[00:20:05.941 --> 00:20:12.285]  You have to have that workload, that hard work in the gym or every day and your job, whatever that is, hard workload.
[00:20:12.825 --> 00:20:13.906]  Then you have to be intimate.
[00:20:14.006 --> 00:20:18.368]  You have to be connected with your spouse or whoever you're with.
[00:20:18.408 --> 00:20:19.989]  And then lastly is nutrition.
[00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:24.972]  All of those are equally important and they all play parts in how you are healthy as a man.
[00:20:25.513 --> 00:20:30.115]  So for me as a male athlete, I have to be intimate with my wife every day, a couple of times a day if I can.
[00:20:30.155 --> 00:20:31.436]  You know, like I have to get good sleep.
[00:20:31.536 --> 00:20:34.058]  I have to have that good work, and I have to have that good food.
[00:20:34.478 --> 00:20:41.184]  And these things, super male vitality, is one of those things that is cornerstone to who I am as an athlete and as a man.
[00:20:41.954 --> 00:20:43.655]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:20:44.235 --> 00:20:45.596]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[00:20:45.816 --> 00:20:49.357]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[00:20:49.718 --> 00:20:57.441]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[00:20:57.661 --> 00:21:02.464]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:21:02.624 --> 00:21:03.344]  The reality is
[00:21:03.644 --> 00:21:08.090]  It's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:21:08.451 --> 00:21:15.981]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:21:16.242 --> 00:21:20.648]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:21:20.928 --> 00:21:26.674]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[00:21:26.814 --> 00:21:29.777]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:21:29.957 --> 00:21:33.241]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:37.184]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:37.425 --> 00:21:39.387]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:01.730]  Well it's on!
[00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:10.613]  We're only 42 days out from this historic 2016 presidential election and it is on.
[00:22:10.693 --> 00:22:19.655]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from the Infowars News Centers in Austin, Texas on AM and FM stations across the country and of course on cable and UHF, VHF as well.
[00:22:19.915 --> 00:22:22.376]  But really where we dominate is the internet.
[00:22:22.936 --> 00:22:29.521]  Infowars.com forward slash show where routinely millions and millions of people tune into these special events.
[00:22:29.922 --> 00:22:40.370]  We had 3.8 million people tune in over 24 hours to our 24-hour video feed in the 2012 election and the numbers show us that this year will probably be double those numbers.
[00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.752]  And the reason I raise that information is we're teleprompter free.
[00:22:44.793 --> 00:22:46.835]  And we are corporate sponsorship free.
[00:22:47.175 --> 00:22:48.496]  We are globalist free.
[00:22:49.116 --> 00:22:49.477]  We are
[00:22:50.976 --> 00:22:52.577]  Americana, not globalists.
[00:22:54.218 --> 00:22:59.401]  We put America first, not the special interest and the New World Order.
[00:22:59.722 --> 00:23:01.903]  Americanism, not globalism.
[00:23:02.763 --> 00:23:08.167]  Now, we have multiple feeds from all over the world.
[00:23:08.207 --> 00:23:14.811]  We have our own feed that you see there on screen of your TV viewer that is a general shot.
[00:23:14.851 --> 00:23:16.712]  We have several other shots.
[00:23:16.732 --> 00:23:18.974]  We're also going to be analyzing mainstream media tonight.
[00:23:19.694 --> 00:23:31.528]  MSNBC, CNN, Fox and how they're responding in live time with a team of reporters and investigative journalists in the newsroom right next door to where I'm sitting right now.
[00:23:31.988 --> 00:23:33.330]  Again, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.192]  We're going to be live here for the next 20 minutes.
[00:23:37.425 --> 00:23:47.268]  Five minutes or so, then we have several video clips we're going to play, and we're going to go live to the debate itself that is 8 o'clock central to 9.30 central.
[00:23:47.648 --> 00:23:52.609]  That's 9 to 10.30 eastern between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:23:53.249 --> 00:23:55.190]  Now, I want to be very, very clear about something here.
[00:23:56.328 --> 00:24:06.331]  We're watching, not just here, but in Europe and across the world, the collapse of the globalist corporate anti-free market crony system that's been established.
[00:24:06.351 --> 00:24:13.514]  They admit that in their own publications, like the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Economist, and of course the Financial Times of London.
[00:24:13.534 --> 00:24:16.675]  They admit their entire system is in free-fall right now.
[00:24:16.695 --> 00:24:22.036]  You've got a bunch of political dinosaurs that don't understand that they've completely lost the info war.
[00:24:22.096 --> 00:24:23.297]  Now they're starting to figure it out.
[00:24:24.226 --> 00:24:26.027]  So the question is, how are they going to strike back?
[00:24:26.868 --> 00:24:40.459]  They're going to try to get populist movements, whether it be UKIP in the UK or the Donald Trump libertarian patriot takeover of the Republican Party, they're going to try to basically get control of them.
[00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:50.928]  And if you watch Fox News, if you watch CNN, if you watch any of these channels, or even some of the commentators on C-SPAN, which we can put back up on screen behind me,
[00:24:52.031 --> 00:25:04.185]  You will notice that they always say Donald Trump will win if he compromises, Donald Trump will win if he goes along with the system, Donald Trump will win if he looks presidential and is very calm and basically says nothing.
[00:25:04.906 --> 00:25:08.870]  That's the diatribe that they are hammering over
[00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.431]  And over, and over, and over again.
[00:25:13.991 --> 00:25:18.093]  They're the same ones that said out of a field of 17 candidates, he'd never get the nomination.
[00:25:18.393 --> 00:25:22.274]  They're the ones that then said the popular vote in the primary didn't matter.
[00:25:22.974 --> 00:25:29.596]  They're the ones that said then that Hillary Clinton would destroy him and be way ahead of him by now, when in real polls, he's 10-15 points ahead of her.
[00:25:29.876 --> 00:25:32.237]  In their spin polls, he's 3-6 points ahead.
[00:25:33.078 --> 00:25:35.618]  They're the ones that have been wrong on every front.
[00:25:35.818 --> 00:25:37.459]  The Karl Roves of the world.
[00:25:40.626 --> 00:25:44.647]  Because you have the Republican establishment, not just the Democrat establishment.
[00:25:48.989 --> 00:26:03.214]  You don't just have the Democratic establishment, you have the Republican establishment that knows exactly what it's doing, trying to keep its power base in control so they can have a rigged economy and become filthy rich from it.
[00:26:04.218 --> 00:26:11.986]  So what you're seeing here tonight is independent media on a shoestring budget doing things that mainstream media and dinosaur media can't even do.
[00:26:13.087 --> 00:26:27.741]  Because they're so controlled top-down, the big corporate chiefs load the teleprompters with the talking points, with the messages that they want to pump out against the public.
[00:26:29.738 --> 00:26:49.623]  But if you look at the numbers and what we're actually seeing, it's that the establishment continues on with this canned garbage and all these talking heads who never get outside the lines and always go along with whatever outrageous stuff's happening like warrantless NSA tapping or the Federal Reserve rigging the stock market on record.
[00:26:50.575 --> 00:27:01.925]  They're all there, the Eric Schmitz of Google you see on screen and others, to just make sure that the same old, same old agenda of consolidation and vertical integration of power begins.
[00:27:02.005 --> 00:27:17.939]  So, the very people that were wrong all along about everything they told you about Trump, who were trying to get you to have a self-fulfilling prophecy that sovereignty and populism and America first was impossible, they're the ones now telling you Trump will be the winner
[00:27:19.133 --> 00:27:27.356]  If he just doesn't basically be rude to Hillary and that she'll be a winner too if she basically isn't rude to Trump.
[00:27:28.037 --> 00:27:31.638]  No, that's the safest thing for the establishment to keep the public asleep.
[00:27:31.958 --> 00:27:35.260]  Donald Trump got where he is because he is a firebrand.
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:42.362]  Donald Trump got where he is because he's breaking all the rules and he's catching a populist wave against globalism.
[00:27:42.783 --> 00:27:48.425]  When you read the white papers or foreign affairs publications where the elite are actually communicating with each other, they admit
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.323]  That they are in abject, complete, and total panic mode.
[00:27:54.384 --> 00:27:57.366]  And that Trump is just a manifestation of that.
[00:27:59.467 --> 00:28:06.152]  Now, in a few minutes, I want to go to a clip of a viral video that Paul Watson put out a few days ago.
[00:28:06.172 --> 00:28:08.874]  And we have these viral videos every few days.
[00:28:09.394 --> 00:28:12.256]  We have videos every few days that get a million, two, three million views apiece.
[00:28:12.897 --> 00:28:15.098]  Sometimes we have videos that get 30 million, 40 million, 50 million.
[00:28:15.959 --> 00:28:18.820]  But generally, a super viral video gets about five million views.
[00:28:19.381 --> 00:28:21.702]  The average Fox show has about a million.
[00:28:22.062 --> 00:28:23.543]  It's dominant on cable news.
[00:28:24.163 --> 00:28:27.564]  The top shows on CNN have about a half million to a million.
[00:28:27.945 --> 00:28:29.285]  Their average show about a hundred thousand.
[00:28:29.305 --> 00:28:30.686]  These people are a joke, okay?
[00:28:32.006 --> 00:28:41.311]  And the reason I raise that is, they have all the glitz, all the glamour, they try to hijack the political process, make you go through their pundits and their system and their political lobbyists.
[00:28:42.451 --> 00:28:43.672]  But all that is coming down.
[00:28:44.901 --> 00:28:45.922]  CNN is collapsing.
[00:28:46.042 --> 00:28:47.223]  MSNBC is a facade.
[00:28:47.463 --> 00:28:48.284]  It's all a joke.
[00:28:49.245 --> 00:28:56.731]  And Paul Watson with InfoWars.com files videos pretty much every day that on average get about a million views.
[00:28:57.671 --> 00:29:05.898]  Well, he put out a video recently that got a quarter million views in a couple hours.
[00:29:06.318 --> 00:29:07.639]  The truth about what happened in Charlotte.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:08.941]  Nothing vile.
[00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:09.621]  No cussing.
[00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:10.562]  Very conservative.
[00:29:11.002 --> 00:29:14.025]  Presented by, you know, a nice handsome journalist.
[00:29:15.515 --> 00:29:18.497]  And they blocked it so it couldn't be spread and couldn't be shared.
[00:29:18.758 --> 00:29:21.079]  And basically killed it so it only got another quarter million.
[00:29:21.099 --> 00:29:21.900]  Now that sounds big.
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:31.107]  He posted it on our Facebook and it got, in the last two days, 16 million views on Facebook's video platform because Google censored it.
[00:29:31.547 --> 00:29:39.614]  Now, again, get to understand, CNN does not have 6 million or 16 million viewers in an entire day.
[00:29:41.317 --> 00:29:46.139]  Fox News has probably got 20 million viewers or more a day.
[00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:53.262]  Fox News that makes billions of dollars a year, has thousands and thousands of employees, studios all over the United States and all over the world.
[00:29:54.082 --> 00:29:57.464]  Fox News, you go look at their videos, none of them are viral compared to this.
[00:29:57.684 --> 00:30:00.325]  You go to Obama's videos, they're barely even viral.
[00:30:00.545 --> 00:30:04.787]  I mean, his average video on his own website on YouTube has a couple thousand views.
[00:30:06.015 --> 00:30:13.744]  What I'm getting at here is you have libertarians and patriots and conservatives and others that are free thinkers on different platforms.
[00:30:14.844 --> 00:30:17.226]  That sometimes get 60 million views on a video.
[00:30:17.666 --> 00:30:18.847]  Their average video, millions.
[00:30:19.327 --> 00:30:21.569]  That's what's panicking the power structure.
[00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:23.611]  It's not just Paul Watson.
[00:30:23.631 --> 00:30:24.631]  It's not just Alex Jones.
[00:30:24.712 --> 00:30:27.394]  It's not just David Knight or Leanne McAdoo or Matt Drudge.
[00:30:27.834 --> 00:30:28.514]  It's you.
[00:30:29.375 --> 00:30:38.882]  And as you get involved, and as you shoot video on the street, and as you give your own commentary, it's going to be more popular than some stuffed shirt or some, you know, lady with fake eyelashes.
[00:30:38.922 --> 00:30:40.003]  I'm not bashing if you have those.
[00:30:40.043 --> 00:30:43.065]  You know, my point, reading off a teleprompter, being told what to say,
[00:30:43.846 --> 00:30:44.627]  Like Megyn Kelly.
[00:30:45.268 --> 00:30:49.775]  And so this is a giant rejection of that across the board.
[00:30:50.115 --> 00:30:53.360]  And it is a very, very exciting time to be alive.
[00:30:54.761 --> 00:31:06.108]  And so tonight, we're going to have live coverage, sharing the debate with our own feed, and also analyzing mainstream media, and even C-SPAN and what they're saying and what they're doing.
[00:31:06.568 --> 00:31:18.476]  And then after the 90-minute debate that ends at 9.30 Central, 10.30 Eastern, that'd be 7.30 Pacific, 8.30 Mountain, we will come back with at least an hour and a half, maybe longer, of live analysis with our crew.
[00:31:18.836 --> 00:31:22.539]  We also have some of our reporters down at one of the major
[00:31:23.499 --> 00:31:24.580]  We're good to go.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.485]  So all this is coming up tonight here in the next four hours.
[00:31:59.525 --> 00:32:01.567]  Now, I want to include the viewers and listeners in this.
[00:32:02.288 --> 00:32:06.833]  You see dinosaur media on its last legs trying to get you to go follow their Twitter, go to their Facebook.
[00:32:08.294 --> 00:32:14.899]  If you follow us on Twitter at RealAlexJones, or if you go and like us on the Facebook, that gives us an even stronger platform inside the globalist system.
[00:32:15.159 --> 00:32:26.709]  But more importantly, it's important to spread the link at InfoWars.com forward slash show that many of you are watching right now to everybody on your text list, on your phone, to folks on your email.
[00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:30.612]  Call your mom or dad up, or your brother, or your sister, or your cousin, or your neighbor.
[00:32:31.604 --> 00:32:55.101]  And tell them, there's independent teleprompter-free media, never before seen in this country, happening right now, and the people's media is going to basically give you the inside scoop on what's breaking down inside this globalist paradigm, and we're going to be taking phone calls also tonight after the debate, and getting your response to highlights of the debate that we are going to be playing.
[00:32:57.133 --> 00:32:58.153]  So please share the link.
[00:32:58.173 --> 00:33:03.535]  We've got a bunch of pages posted on InfoWars.com that also copy our feed if it goes down because too many people.
[00:33:03.895 --> 00:33:08.656]  We've had a million before get on it and it did crash, even though we have one of the biggest services out there that we use.
[00:33:09.096 --> 00:33:15.998]  We have a YouTube backup and we have a bunch of other backups as well at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:33:16.398 --> 00:33:22.080]  So many times we have these events, people say, I was watching you on PrisonPlanet.tv as a member, but then you have it free to the public sometimes.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.400]  Yeah, on a big event, it's just for everybody.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.481]  We can't afford to have it free all the time with the bandwidth.
[00:33:26.861 --> 00:33:33.684]  But then if our feed goes down, you then have all the other feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:33:33.804 --> 00:33:44.388]  But, let's talk about the video, what they're not telling you about Charlotte, that YouTube censored, but Paul didn't roll over, InfoWars didn't roll over, you didn't roll over.
[00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:49.110]  We reposted it to just his personal Facebook page, not even to ours.
[00:33:49.691 --> 00:33:54.413]  This is three days ago when they censored it, on Friday or on Saturday, and so,
[00:33:55.393 --> 00:33:57.396]  It got 16 million views.
[00:33:57.436 --> 00:33:58.797]  Now, I know these videos.
[00:33:59.218 --> 00:34:01.321]  It would have gotten maybe 5 million on YouTube.
[00:34:01.681 --> 00:34:04.324]  But because they censored it, it got 16 million.
[00:34:04.645 --> 00:34:06.407]  That's 11 million more.
[00:34:07.268 --> 00:34:08.570]  Paul has viral videos all the time.
[00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:09.891]  The rest of our crew do as well.
[00:34:10.332 --> 00:34:13.776]  I mean, this is because we have great listeners that spread the word and we put out great, compelling content.
[00:34:14.562 --> 00:34:22.888]  So, remember, they're talking about this being the biggest thing in history with a hundred million viewers tonight because they've got more stations and more affiliates airing it.
[00:34:23.088 --> 00:34:24.148]  This is coming out of a university.
[00:34:24.189 --> 00:34:24.609]  That's good.
[00:34:25.009 --> 00:34:26.470]  That is more fair use for the public.
[00:34:28.752 --> 00:34:32.254]  And you know, here comes Donald Trump rolling in and Hillary in a little medical van.
[00:34:32.494 --> 00:34:34.636]  So it's all happening live right now if you're a radio listener.
[00:34:35.476 --> 00:34:39.559]  You can listen as you're driving on the road and get play-by-play at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:42.080]  But the whole thing is blowing up in their face and
[00:34:43.126 --> 00:34:43.926]  History is happening.
[00:34:44.586 --> 00:34:45.927]  So how does Trump win this?
[00:34:45.967 --> 00:35:01.872]  Being genuine, pointing out that it's good that he's an outsider, not an insider, that Hillary is the consummate insider and the author of much of our problems today, and that he just wants to give America a level playing field and get the globalists to take their foot off our neck, and that he's part of a global populist movement with the rest of the American people.
[00:35:02.887 --> 00:35:15.399]  And to be humble, and to thank everybody for their support, and to show how all the pundits have been wrong, in both the Republican and Democratic Party, and I don't think he should be too nasty, but he also shouldn't listen to them, and quote, just sit there and act like a stuffed shirt.
[00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:17.922]  Sure they'd love for him to go to sleep, not change things.
[00:35:18.082 --> 00:35:18.822]  They'll let him in then!
[00:35:19.807 --> 00:35:24.593]  What they're really saying when they say, be a stuffed shirt, is that if he just lays down and goes to sleep, they might leave him alone.
[00:35:24.893 --> 00:35:28.538]  If you just acted like a populist to get the support, well that's okay.
[00:35:28.658 --> 00:35:34.205]  But if you keep firebranding, if you keep using this platform, and here's the big issue, to change the world.
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:36.321]  You're our enemy.
[00:35:37.122 --> 00:35:37.982]  And we're coming after you.
[00:35:38.183 --> 00:35:38.703]  Well, you know what?
[00:35:38.723 --> 00:35:42.347]  We're not trying to just cozy up and get Trump as some new president for the elite.
[00:35:42.727 --> 00:35:43.708]  We want to change things.
[00:35:43.748 --> 00:35:44.750]  We want to challenge things.
[00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:45.811]  We want to have debates.
[00:35:45.831 --> 00:35:47.592]  We want to get outside of safe spaces.
[00:35:47.913 --> 00:35:52.177]  We want to change the paradigm and get Americans that are in a mind-zombie mode.
[00:35:52.878 --> 00:35:56.622]  To understand there's a new world order and globalism and shift the paradigm.
[00:35:56.762 --> 00:36:03.688]  This isn't about playing along with the fake construct that Karl Rove and all the rest of the Republicans and Democrats want us to be part of.
[00:36:03.869 --> 00:36:08.873]  It's about breaking out of their construct and getting back to Americana and Renaissance and moving forward.
[00:36:09.494 --> 00:36:10.555]  That's what it's truly about.
[00:36:10.775 --> 00:36:16.059]  And Alex, speaking of fake constructs, they just showed Hillary Clinton walking in, but they didn't show her getting out of the van.
[00:36:16.099 --> 00:36:18.681]  They showed her coming around from behind the van.
[00:36:18.741 --> 00:36:20.583]  So we didn't actually see her getting out.
[00:36:20.603 --> 00:36:23.425]  That's right, because the Secret Service told us five weeks ago they'd lower her down.
[00:36:23.465 --> 00:36:24.206]  That's been confirmed.
[00:36:24.646 --> 00:36:26.227]  And that she falls down with convulsions.
[00:36:26.267 --> 00:36:26.848]  Then it happened.
[00:36:28.433 --> 00:36:29.234]  Any other information?
[00:36:29.254 --> 00:36:30.895]  We're about to go to this clip and bring McAdoo in.
[00:36:31.215 --> 00:36:33.137]  Yeah, I think we're ready to go to the clip now, but that was it.
[00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:39.322]  But she was walking under her own power, and it looks like she was wearing some sort of tight-fitting clothing, not a giant green coat.
[00:36:40.443 --> 00:36:42.925]  Absolutely, in hot weather like she was yesterday in New York.
[00:36:43.045 --> 00:36:45.487]  All right, so we've got all the coverage.
[00:36:45.507 --> 00:36:49.831]  We've got the vice presidential Republican candidate right there, Governor Pence behind us.
[00:36:49.911 --> 00:36:50.731]  It's all coming up.
[00:36:51.092 --> 00:36:55.435]  This is true coverage of the media, of the debate, and all of it.
[00:36:55.455 --> 00:36:56.456]  We're on the edge of our seats.
[00:36:56.496 --> 00:36:57.297]  Will she collapse?
[00:36:59.235 --> 00:37:00.837]  Will Hillary have a coughing fit?
[00:37:00.997 --> 00:37:07.283]  In fact, we have votes that tens of thousands have actually voted in on our Twitter alone and the majority of folks think she will have a coughing fit.
[00:37:08.465 --> 00:37:11.868]  At the end of this clip, we'll bring McAdoo in and we'll also look at that poll.
[00:37:12.108 --> 00:37:15.812]  Let's go ahead and go to the censored clip that they don't want you to see.
[00:37:17.042 --> 00:37:20.884]  But again, we get many weeks, 30, 40, 50 million views just on YouTube alone.
[00:37:21.184 --> 00:37:22.845]  That's on a big week, normally 10 million.
[00:37:23.025 --> 00:37:23.385]  Think about it.
[00:37:23.505 --> 00:37:25.046]  This is the biggest thing in history, 100 million.
[00:37:25.506 --> 00:37:26.827]  We get that every few weeks.
[00:37:27.187 --> 00:37:29.568]  This shows how we're the real media.
[00:37:29.608 --> 00:37:30.068]  They're not.
[00:37:30.128 --> 00:37:33.310]  They're the pretenders with bigger and bigger sets like the Wizard of Oz.
[00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:33.790]  Here's the clip.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:43.649]  Harmonious Black Lives Matter activists staged a peaceful protest in Charlotte last night, but were brutally tear-gassed by racist cops.
[00:37:43.929 --> 00:37:44.730]  Oh, wait a second.
[00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:48.815]  Physically attacking reporters is not a legitimate form of protest.
[00:37:48.955 --> 00:37:52.599]  Shooting each other is not a legitimate form of protest.
[00:37:52.839 --> 00:37:58.701]  Stealing and looting cash registers from local businesses is not a legitimate form of protest.
[00:37:58.841 --> 00:38:03.683]  Trying to set journalists on fire is not a legitimate form of protest.
[00:38:03.803 --> 00:38:09.725]  Throwing rocks off bridges at passing vehicles full of families is not a legitimate form of protest.
[00:38:11.786 --> 00:38:17.607]  Beating up innocent people in underground parking lots because they're white is not a legitimate form of protest.
[00:38:17.707 --> 00:38:25.950]  Smashing up apartment windows where black people live to protest in favor of Black Lives Matter is not a legitimate form of protest.
[00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:32.651]  Smashing up buses that poor black people rely on to get to their jobs is not a legitimate form of protest.
[00:38:32.731 --> 00:38:39.473]  Looting the Charlotte Hornets team store so you can steal basketball merchandise is not a legitimate form of protest.
[00:38:39.753 --> 00:38:42.995]  Stealing sneakers is not a legitimate form of protest.
[00:38:43.155 --> 00:38:49.199]  Attempting to hijack cars and terrify their innocent occupants is not a legitimate form of protest.
[00:38:49.279 --> 00:38:51.981]  But how did MSNBC report on all this?
[00:38:52.201 --> 00:38:54.743]  By calling the rioters peaceful!
[00:38:55.103 --> 00:39:01.007]  The people that are out here protesting, they're hugging and they're like, they're being very peaceful.
[00:39:01.127 --> 00:39:03.828]  We were following this crowd that was largely peaceful.
[00:39:03.889 --> 00:39:04.909]  Mostly peaceful.
[00:39:05.029 --> 00:39:09.892]  We've also seen some sweet scenes of protesters hugging one another and praying.
[00:39:09.972 --> 00:39:11.894]  Mostly a group of peaceful protesters.
[00:39:11.934 --> 00:39:12.374]  Peaceful.
[00:39:12.654 --> 00:39:13.174]  He's four.
[00:39:13.214 --> 00:39:13.795]  He's four.
[00:39:13.835 --> 00:39:14.415]  He's four.
[00:39:14.455 --> 00:39:15.015]  He's four.
[00:39:15.096 --> 00:39:19.538]  And that's why 94% of Americans don't trust the mainstream media.
[00:39:19.618 --> 00:39:26.042]  What's unfolding in Charlotte is objectively, manifestly, provably not a protest.
[00:39:26.222 --> 00:39:32.046]  It's a violent, unjustified riot by criminals, gang members, and thugs.
[00:39:32.286 --> 00:39:38.190]  Why is the media giving it legitimacy by still referring to it as a protest?
[00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:48.154]  If mobs of white supremacists were looting stores, setting fires, attacking journalists and shooting guns, would the media call it a protest?
[00:39:48.294 --> 00:39:49.934]  But maybe I'm wrong.
[00:39:50.194 --> 00:39:59.558]  Maybe all this was completely justified because another racist white police officer killed an innocent unarmed black man who was merely carrying a book.
[00:39:59.938 --> 00:40:02.600]  Oh wait, he was actually killed by a black cop.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.601]  All white people are f***ing devils.
[00:40:04.721 --> 00:40:06.822]  But what kind of book was he carrying?
[00:40:07.122 --> 00:40:07.782]  Paperback?
[00:40:08.023 --> 00:40:08.663]  Hardcover?
[00:40:09.083 --> 00:40:10.944]  Oh no, it was a 9mm gun.
[00:40:11.044 --> 00:40:12.445]  Well, imagine my shock.
[00:40:12.625 --> 00:40:21.530]  So a black cop shoots an armed black thug with a criminal record, and then a black protester shoots another black protester.
[00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.652]  Yeah, must be white people's fault.
[00:40:23.772 --> 00:40:26.374]  I guess it's my fault for not checking my privilege.
[00:40:26.554 --> 00:40:35.041]  And how did de facto Black Lives Matter leader D. Ray McKesson respond to the riots, the looting, the bloodshed, the mayhem, the violence?
[00:40:35.261 --> 00:40:37.803]  By tweeting, we stand with you.
[00:40:37.903 --> 00:40:41.586]  Because nothing says justice like destroying your own city.
[00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:47.830]  And living up to the very stereotype about black people that you constantly complain about.
[00:40:48.011 --> 00:40:50.993]  Barack Obama also stands with this group.
[00:40:51.193 --> 00:40:57.838]  While billionaire white elitist George Soros bankrolls it to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:40:57.878 --> 00:41:01.520]  Hillary Clinton has promised to change laws for them.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.662]  They advocate killing cops.
[00:41:07.079 --> 00:41:11.402]  They've inspired mass murderers who have killed black cops.
[00:41:11.622 --> 00:41:18.165]  Their ideological guru is a convicted cop killer on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list.
[00:41:18.306 --> 00:41:27.551]  They've built an entire movement based around the completely fraudulent narrative that there's a racist war against black people being waged by cops.
[00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:30.772]  It's manifestly, provably, not true.
[00:41:30.892 --> 00:41:36.853]  This is what they're protesting against, while none of them give a damn about this.
[00:41:37.193 --> 00:41:45.295]  Thanks to Black Lives Matter, more black people are killing each other because cops refuse to patrol these areas.
[00:41:45.455 --> 00:41:47.515]  Black Lives Matter is poison.
[00:41:47.615 --> 00:41:51.316]  It's doing incredible harm to race relations in America.
[00:41:51.436 --> 00:41:56.777]  It's giving gang member thugs an excuse to carry out criminal rampages.
[00:41:56.997 --> 00:42:02.202]  And it's resulting in more black people being killed by other black people.
[00:42:02.382 --> 00:42:07.767]  How many more cities need to burn before this reality is realized?
[00:42:07.988 --> 00:42:10.971]  He's four, he's four, he's four, he's four, he's four.
[00:42:13.402 --> 00:42:16.044]  Now, I know why MSNBC didn't want us here, Matt.
[00:42:16.064 --> 00:42:20.466]  I was seeing peaceful, peaceful, peaceful video of people attacking basically black KKK members.
[00:42:20.486 --> 00:42:21.847]  We're against the KKK attacking blacks.
[00:42:22.087 --> 00:42:24.369]  We're against blacks attacking whites.
[00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:30.052]  We're only 16 minutes and 15 seconds out from this historic debate, the biggest ever.
[00:42:30.513 --> 00:42:32.054]  We're going to have our own live feed.
[00:42:32.114 --> 00:42:32.934]  Our reporters are there.
[00:42:32.954 --> 00:42:33.815]  We've also got C-SPAN.
[00:42:33.835 --> 00:42:35.196]  We're going to be analyzing.
[00:42:36.056 --> 00:42:37.997]  Mainstream media and breaking that down.
[00:42:38.077 --> 00:42:39.277]  I want to put on screen for TV viewers.
[00:42:39.837 --> 00:42:40.937]  This was from this morning.
[00:42:40.977 --> 00:42:43.318]  It had 16 plus million views and this happens all the time.
[00:42:43.358 --> 00:42:48.299]  Just an example of a video they tried to censor on YouTube blocking it at a half million views.
[00:42:48.819 --> 00:42:50.580]  And so it got 16 million on Facebook.
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.941]  See, the fact that they try to suppress us only makes it bigger.
[00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:58.422]  And that's why we have a billion views on one channel, five billion views total.
[00:42:59.608 --> 00:43:01.089]  Because we are dominating.
[00:43:01.129 --> 00:43:01.869]  We are the future.
[00:43:01.929 --> 00:43:02.850]  We're the real liberals.
[00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:07.673]  Not the fake establishment liberals that tell you what words to use.
[00:43:07.693 --> 00:43:08.554]  16 million views.
[00:43:08.834 --> 00:43:11.275]  Now, I checked an hour ago, it's over 17 million.
[00:43:11.595 --> 00:43:12.856]  It'll be 30 million in a week.
[00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:14.597]  They might try to censor that.
[00:43:14.657 --> 00:43:17.619]  But look, you can't censor something people are hungry for.
[00:43:17.919 --> 00:43:20.241]  They can't get Maddow's videos on YouTube.
[00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:21.822]  Might get 4 or 5 thousand views.
[00:43:22.022 --> 00:43:23.663]  No one wants these people.
[00:43:23.703 --> 00:43:24.263]  They're a joke.
[00:43:24.744 --> 00:43:25.824]  We're bigger than they are.
[00:43:25.844 --> 00:43:28.046]  And I don't want to be bigger than they are, but it's a hoax.
[00:43:28.886 --> 00:43:29.527]  It's a hoax.
[00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:33.529]  Now, Leanne McAdoo is seriously riding shotgun with David Knight, myself and others.
[00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:37.112]  We've got several hours of post-game after this when we can really analyze it.
[00:43:37.132 --> 00:43:40.595]  We're going to have crews grabbing clips and doing real fact-checking and putting them out.
[00:43:40.815 --> 00:43:44.938]  That's what's really going to be viral and important is that we've got a great crew up here, people behind the scenes.
[00:43:45.598 --> 00:43:46.999]  Leanne, history is happening.
[00:43:47.019 --> 00:43:51.582]  Do you agree with me that this is about the establishment trying to make Trump
[00:43:52.483 --> 00:43:58.389]  You know, behave like an establishment person when being a populist is how he got where he is.
[00:43:58.649 --> 00:44:01.432]  Now they say, oh you won the primary that way, now go to sleep.
[00:44:01.492 --> 00:44:02.754]  No, we want to change things.
[00:44:03.014 --> 00:44:05.697]  We don't want to play along so the mainstream media likes us.
[00:44:05.897 --> 00:44:10.302]  We're here to destroy that paradigm peacefully and bring in the new renaissance.
[00:44:10.842 --> 00:44:19.608]  It'll be really interesting to see what tack he takes here in this debate, because that's what they've been feeding him, telling him, you know, calm down, you need to relax, be more presidential.
[00:44:19.668 --> 00:44:21.990]  And he's saying, look, that's not why the people like me.
[00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.391]  That's not what this movement is all about.
[00:44:23.751 --> 00:44:26.012]  I'm here to change things, to switch things up.
[00:44:26.333 --> 00:44:32.277]  That's why he hasn't even been prepping for the debate in the typical ways, which is making, of course, all of these establishment people
[00:44:32.837 --> 00:44:42.465]  Really, you're kind of frightened about the fact that he's not doing these mock debates and things like that, that Hillary Clinton is used to preparing for these debates in this way.
[00:44:42.525 --> 00:44:44.166]  He's like, no, I'm going to be off the cuff.
[00:44:44.246 --> 00:44:45.107]  I'm going to be myself.
[00:44:45.167 --> 00:44:45.987]  The people like that.
[00:44:46.027 --> 00:44:46.688]  They like the truth.
[00:44:46.748 --> 00:44:52.072]  And just like with Paul Joseph Watson's video that they try to suppress, and now it's getting over 16 million views.
[00:44:52.472 --> 00:44:56.956]  People, if you try to hide something or if you try to tell people how to think these days,
[00:44:57.576 --> 00:45:04.984]  People just have this innate sort of truth sensor inside of them that we're all born with and I think that that's really getting switched on right now.
[00:45:05.745 --> 00:45:08.287]  And it's not like we have viral videos once a month.
[00:45:08.327 --> 00:45:10.890]  We have them every day with millions of views.
[00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:11.691]  They're panicking.
[00:45:11.871 --> 00:45:13.032]  We are bigger than they are.
[00:45:13.433 --> 00:45:15.955]  We don't make a billion dollars like they do and that's the fraud.
[00:45:16.596 --> 00:45:20.420]  Fox makes a billion dollars a year and is now turning into the Clinton News Network.
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.541]  It gets contracts from the federal government.
[00:45:22.601 --> 00:45:23.901]  You know, that's our taxpayer dollars.
[00:45:24.161 --> 00:45:32.084]  And that's why it was so telling when YouTube, Jared Cohen there with the Jigsaw, one of the subsidiaries of Google, said that they wanted to level the playing field.
[00:45:32.444 --> 00:45:36.646]  And that's why they were going to start demonetizing videos and start censoring videos.
[00:45:36.666 --> 00:45:37.366]  Oh yeah, we now have proof.
[00:45:37.386 --> 00:45:42.808]  When we put out a video exposing ISIS or radical Islam, they demonetize it, claiming we're promoting radical Islam.
[00:45:42.828 --> 00:45:42.968]  Yeah.
[00:45:43.368 --> 00:45:46.790]  No, no, we're exposing it, but only mainstream media is allowed to actually say the word.
[00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:50.772]  It'll leave up all the jihadi recruitment videos, mind you, but ours get taken down.
[00:45:50.812 --> 00:45:54.054]  If we're trying to bring the truth about what's really going on, those get taken down.
[00:45:54.094 --> 00:45:55.235]  And you cannot make this up.
[00:45:55.275 --> 00:45:56.356]  You've got some really good points.
[00:45:56.376 --> 00:46:00.218]  You wanted to get into Clinton releases Trump lies, quote, before the debate.
[00:46:00.538 --> 00:46:01.299]  Right, exactly.
[00:46:01.359 --> 00:46:05.261]  So she thought she would get ahead of the game and say Trump is not allowed to win the debate.
[00:46:05.341 --> 00:46:10.225]  No one is allowed to say that he won the debate if he utters any of these lies.
[00:46:10.565 --> 00:46:14.768]  And so there were like 19 pages of... Where she wants to control the narrative.
[00:46:14.788 --> 00:46:15.789]  It's always... Exactly.
[00:46:15.809 --> 00:46:18.151]  It's like the Washington Post today said, don't call us media.
[00:46:18.551 --> 00:46:19.612]  Because people go, the media.
[00:46:19.632 --> 00:46:20.592]  They go, we're not media.
[00:46:20.652 --> 00:46:21.413]  It doesn't exist.
[00:46:21.653 --> 00:46:25.055]  We're all independent and we're free thinkers and we have our own brains.
[00:46:25.495 --> 00:46:29.197]  When the White House talking points that just got put on my desk told me to say that.
[00:46:29.217 --> 00:46:30.537]  So what are the lies?
[00:46:30.577 --> 00:46:32.678]  In fact, this is a blueprint of what she's going to say tonight.
[00:46:32.818 --> 00:46:32.999]  Exactly.
[00:46:33.019 --> 00:46:34.559]  And we're going to be countering her with the reality.
[00:46:34.719 --> 00:46:35.140]  Exactly.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:43.023]  Well, so she has like 19 pages of them, of these supposed lies, but she calls these Trump's seven deadly lies.
[00:46:43.384 --> 00:46:50.207]  The top one, the deadly lies, number one is that Trump says, I was totally against the war in Iraq.
[00:46:50.407 --> 00:46:53.908]  He's wrote a book, he was on record, he got criticized in 2003.
[00:46:54.108 --> 00:46:59.169]  Well, what they use as proof that he was not totally, and see that's the thing I wanted to bring up.
[00:46:59.249 --> 00:46:59.849]  No, I know what they do.
[00:46:59.869 --> 00:47:00.910]  I haven't even read this yet.
[00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:02.930]  They say later he said keep troops in.
[00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:05.011]  Yeah, once you screw the whole thing over.
[00:47:05.031 --> 00:47:05.751]  No, no, no.
[00:47:05.891 --> 00:47:07.891]  So he's on Howard Stern, okay?
[00:47:07.971 --> 00:47:09.972]  Howard Stern, okay?
[00:47:10.052 --> 00:47:13.213]  It's Donald Trump, it's, you know, ten years ago, he's a, just a, he's a,
[00:47:15.373 --> 00:47:15.853]  Entertainer!
[00:47:15.873 --> 00:47:16.534]  He's not running for president.
[00:47:16.554 --> 00:47:17.995]  Well, he's having fun promoting his businesses.
[00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:20.577]  Yeah, and so he's like, well, do you think we should invade Iraq?
[00:47:20.597 --> 00:47:22.478]  And he's like, yeah, sure, I guess.
[00:47:23.279 --> 00:47:24.840]  I wish we would have done it right the first time.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:33.006]  That's what they're taking as proof that Donald Trump was for the Iraq- He had not- Even though in hundreds of statements and a book in 2002 and 2003 he said that.
[00:47:33.026 --> 00:47:34.367]  So that's point number one.
[00:47:34.387 --> 00:47:35.208]  She's going to bring that up.
[00:47:35.288 --> 00:47:35.748]  Yeah.
[00:47:36.068 --> 00:47:40.832]  She's the one that had 500,000 Iraqis die when she was co-president with those sanctions.
[00:47:40.872 --> 00:47:42.093]  Bring that up when she does that tonight.
[00:47:42.774 --> 00:47:43.294]  I'm going to.
[00:47:43.334 --> 00:47:43.654]  Murder.
[00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:44.575]  He voted for it.
[00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:49.260]  You know, she was the one who actually had the power to get- This is what's going to be happening post-game tonight.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.401]  Trump had no power.
[00:47:50.821 --> 00:47:52.143]  Okay, so I really don't care.
[00:47:52.163 --> 00:47:54.305]  What about fact-checking?
[00:47:54.325 --> 00:47:55.286]  We're going to go over some more of these.
[00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:57.808]  Fact-checking is now just opinion.
[00:47:58.088 --> 00:48:02.032]  Well, okay, so that's a perfect example to kind of lead out of- They don't want us to be able to fact-check.
[00:48:02.172 --> 00:48:02.373]  Right.
[00:48:02.393 --> 00:48:03.213]  Because we're better.
[00:48:03.514 --> 00:48:05.656]  Well, so the Washington Post gave his
[00:48:07.188 --> 00:48:09.590]  Going against the war in Iraq for Pinocchio's.
[00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:14.314]  And the way that they're doing this now with the fact-checking, it's now become opinion-based journalism.
[00:48:14.374 --> 00:48:15.995]  It's not fact-checking what they do.
[00:48:16.055 --> 00:48:18.217]  And the Washington Post, again, it tells you what's Pinocchio.
[00:48:18.237 --> 00:48:18.998]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:48:19.538 --> 00:48:22.060]  Well, the Washington Post is Pinocchio.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:22.361]  Right.
[00:48:22.961 --> 00:48:34.410]  Well, they, what they do is they get into the minutiae of, this article actually points it out perfectly, is that, yeah, maybe he wasn't totally against the Iraq war, but he was kind of, mostly.
[00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:45.738]  He's on record saying, don't do it, but then once he talked to generals and we're in, they said, listen, now it's so destabilized, we should have never taken Saddam out, now it's going to be a civil war, if we don't, they're going to create an Islamic State.
[00:48:46.059 --> 00:48:47.520]  So now he says we need to go back.
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:48.080]  Right.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.761]  But they go, oh, you flip-flopped.
[00:48:49.902 --> 00:48:51.563]  No, it's 15 years later.
[00:48:51.923 --> 00:48:53.765]  Hillary Clinton is the master flip-flopper.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.022]  No, Abu Bhabi Boo Boo did.
[00:49:12.222 --> 00:49:13.223]  It's figurative.
[00:49:13.623 --> 00:49:17.547]  When she says he's the top recruiter for him, that's figurative too.
[00:49:17.627 --> 00:49:24.333]  Well actually what she goes on to say, Clinton was one of the loudest forces for keeping a residual force in Iraq and for arming the rebels.
[00:49:25.114 --> 00:49:28.657]  Which, as heavily documented, has turned into ISIS.
[00:49:28.697 --> 00:49:29.758]  They've defected to ISIS.
[00:49:29.778 --> 00:49:30.619]  Because they're Wahhabis.
[00:49:30.639 --> 00:49:31.680]  We gotta move quick here.
[00:49:33.121 --> 00:49:36.904]  So now, no third party candidates, thank goodness.
[00:49:36.944 --> 00:49:40.127]  Well, I mean, I'll tell you, they're ignoring the Green Party candidate who's pretty darn good.
[00:49:40.407 --> 00:49:42.349]  And I'm good with her policies, but she's for real.
[00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:45.171]  They don't want her in there because she'll take votes from Hillary.
[00:49:45.532 --> 00:49:45.932]  I'm telling you.
[00:49:45.952 --> 00:49:47.133]  No, mine was actually at Hofstra.
[00:49:47.153 --> 00:49:47.854]  I got kicked out.
[00:49:48.494 --> 00:49:48.734]  Really?
[00:49:48.854 --> 00:49:50.055]  Yeah, because she's not.
[00:49:50.135 --> 00:49:50.376]  Oh yeah.
[00:49:50.496 --> 00:49:53.698]  Well Johnson is pulling mainly from Trump, that's why he's the darling.
[00:49:54.159 --> 00:49:55.179]  And again, why vote for Trump?
[00:49:55.199 --> 00:49:58.582]  The entire establishment is having conniption fits over, you gotta go for Trump.
[00:49:58.862 --> 00:50:07.349]  Right, well thank goodness that Gary Johnson is not there representing the Libertarian Party because if there was ever a year for a third party to stand out, this would be the year.
[00:50:07.369 --> 00:50:10.091]  And he is so not a Libertarian.
[00:50:10.471 --> 00:50:14.474]  He was kind of thrown in there to make the Libertarian Party look like a bunch of fools.
[00:50:14.834 --> 00:50:17.076]  He's more of a globalist shill, just like
[00:50:17.196 --> 00:50:20.657]  For TPP, gun control, and notice, I'm all for new building third parties.
[00:50:20.677 --> 00:50:21.778]  Prison industrial complex.
[00:50:21.818 --> 00:50:24.619]  But Trump and the Liberty Movement, we took over the Republicans.
[00:50:24.839 --> 00:50:25.580]  They admit that.
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:26.280]  They're freaking out.
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:27.220]  It's the end of the Bush era.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.901]  Now we want to end the Clinton era.
[00:50:29.261 --> 00:50:32.122]  So instead of just creating a new party, we took the party over.
[00:50:32.602 --> 00:50:34.063]  And so that's what's really happening here.
[00:50:34.083 --> 00:50:36.604]  That's why this is such a referendum against the globalists.
[00:50:36.864 --> 00:50:42.807]  And it's why once Trump gets in, we do have to stay on not so much him, but his surrounding court.
[00:50:43.507 --> 00:50:43.928]  We're good to go.
[00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:04.811]  Neck and neck.
[00:51:05.071 --> 00:51:06.052]  I mean, totally tied.
[00:51:06.072 --> 00:51:07.473]  And that's their spin polls, yeah.
[00:51:07.693 --> 00:51:10.196]  Yeah, and you know, who knows with these polls?
[00:51:10.496 --> 00:51:16.041]  Of course they could be doing that to just up the suspense on this, to make sure that they're the most epic ratings ever for a debate.
[00:51:16.101 --> 00:51:19.845]  I mean, these are Super Bowl-level ratings that they're expecting for tonight.
[00:51:20.225 --> 00:51:30.074]  So, yeah, I mean, that's the thing I was kind of getting to with Roger Stone yesterday, is that they are, either way, they're being set up for something once either one of them gets in office.
[00:51:30.094 --> 00:51:30.394]  That's right.
[00:51:30.434 --> 00:51:31.515]  Well, listen.
[00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:34.017]  The German government has said, get food, get water for a month.
[00:51:34.037 --> 00:51:35.578]  The biggest emergency ever is about to come.
[00:51:35.858 --> 00:51:37.759]  The big German central bank is about to go under.
[00:51:37.999 --> 00:51:38.720]  That's Bloomberg.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.680]  That's Associated Press.
[00:51:39.981 --> 00:51:41.922]  We, of course, had guests on three months ago saying, get ready.
[00:51:41.962 --> 00:51:42.602]  Now they're saying it.
[00:51:43.023 --> 00:51:44.003]  I don't want to be glim and doom.
[00:51:44.123 --> 00:51:44.784]  I want to get ready.
[00:51:44.924 --> 00:51:45.604]  I want to stop it.
[00:51:46.145 --> 00:51:48.146]  I don't like this fiat system, but we're riding on it.
[00:51:48.166 --> 00:51:48.887]  I don't want it to sink.
[00:51:49.307 --> 00:51:50.508]  I want to try to fix it and reform it.
[00:51:52.179 --> 00:52:01.226]  But we've got globalists like Soros that want to just dynamite it all, because he knows he's going to manage the quote, recovery, the reconstruction, the Marshall Plan, in his own words.
[00:52:02.227 --> 00:52:05.709]  We need a Marshall Plan for the world, and then he controls the money.
[00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:07.251]  No, no, no.
[00:52:07.511 --> 00:52:10.353]  What is your, again, gut, Leanne McAdoo for Infowars.com.
[00:52:10.593 --> 00:52:11.834]  We're now six, seven minutes out.
[00:52:11.854 --> 00:52:13.355]  Let me jump in here real quick, Alex.
[00:52:13.395 --> 00:52:18.039]  If you take a look at the split screen there, we're already at 40,000 people just watching on one stream.
[00:52:18.299 --> 00:52:19.300]  I think that's pretty impressive.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:20.521]  Excellent.
[00:52:20.941 --> 00:52:22.142]  Thank you all for watching.
[00:52:22.262 --> 00:52:23.142]  Well, Sharon, let's be clear.
[00:52:23.622 --> 00:52:29.906]  I've built over 3 million terrestrial radio listeners rated by ad agencies every day with almost 200 affiliates.
[00:52:30.266 --> 00:52:33.488]  And then we have over a million that get the podcast every day and tens of millions that watch YouTube.
[00:52:33.768 --> 00:52:36.630]  But what's fun is to have eight or nine different streams
[00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:46.672]  And to know, tomorrow, conservatively, we'll have a half million viewers that tuned into this live event, and then we'll have videos that are snippets of our analysis that get seen by, I guess, 20 million people.
[00:52:46.692 --> 00:52:54.633]  In a couple days, we'll have, you know, a few dozen videos that have 20 million views that'll dominate the coverage and analysis of this with our common sense grassroots talking points.
[00:52:54.653 --> 00:53:02.775]  But yes, you go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, you've got a bunch of different feeds, including YouTube, and there's one of them with 40,000 people tuned in right there.
[00:53:03.055 --> 00:53:03.375]  And again,
[00:53:04.215 --> 00:53:11.500]  If you're a Democrat, if you're a Libertarian, if you're a Communist, if you're an Atheist, whatever you are, go do your own live feed of this as well.
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:15.522]  That's what we're trying people to do, is to break the monopoly of the establishment.
[00:53:17.079 --> 00:53:18.520]  Yeah, I totally agree, Alex.
[00:53:18.761 --> 00:53:24.466]  But it's just really as humbling watching the numbers of people that are coming in and watching this and on our own feeds.
[00:53:24.486 --> 00:53:27.609]  They're not even, they're bypassing the mainstream media paradigm.
[00:53:27.629 --> 00:53:28.790]  Oh look, there's Bill Clinton!
[00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:29.610]  Oh, C-SPAN!
[00:53:29.811 --> 00:53:31.072]  Let's cut to that feed.
[00:53:31.092 --> 00:53:32.513]  I mean, there's the corpse.
[00:53:32.593 --> 00:53:33.194]  There he is.
[00:53:33.214 --> 00:53:34.495]  There is Mrs. Trump.
[00:53:40.766 --> 00:53:41.146]  I don't know.
[00:53:58.558 --> 00:54:00.499]  I mean, I don't mean to use a gross analogy but that's it.
[00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:32.534]  Well, I mean, I guess my big concern is what is Donald Trump going to do if he gets elected, when he gets elected?
[00:54:32.674 --> 00:54:36.536]  What is he going to do when he gets thrown right into World War III?
[00:54:36.556 --> 00:54:37.597]  We have to be behind him.
[00:54:38.198 --> 00:54:43.001]  I mean, Obama is doing everything he can to get the wheels in motion for this before he leaves office.
[00:54:43.041 --> 00:54:44.862]  Did you see the chairman's message to staff Sunday?
[00:54:44.882 --> 00:54:45.342]  We were on the show.
[00:54:45.382 --> 00:54:47.444]  We played it saying, I've been asked to attack Russia.
[00:54:47.784 --> 00:54:50.826]  If you want to know flaws on this war with Russia, I need to be openly told to attack Russia.
[00:54:51.006 --> 00:54:51.126]  Right.
[00:54:51.326 --> 00:54:53.668]  I need a declaration from Congress and the President for World War III.
[00:54:54.028 --> 00:54:55.530]  I mean, and the average American doesn't know this is happening.
[00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:57.211]  We'll play that in the post-game.
[00:54:57.491 --> 00:54:58.712]  The debate is about to begin.
[00:54:58.793 --> 00:55:02.316]  Lester Holt, who I actually like, I think he's going to be fair.
[00:55:02.356 --> 00:55:08.481]  I'm just guessing that because I didn't even know the guy was more of a libertarian conservative, but I always like Lester Holt when I see him.
[00:55:08.661 --> 00:55:10.643]  He does better reports a lot of times, seems fairer.
[00:55:10.943 --> 00:55:11.864]  We'll see what happens.
[00:55:12.324 --> 00:55:13.904]  But Lester Holt is about to take over.
[00:55:13.944 --> 00:55:14.705]  They're about to begin it.
[00:55:14.725 --> 00:55:16.365]  We're going to go to a little three-minute piece.
[00:55:16.705 --> 00:55:19.186]  We're going to come back, and we're going to carry our feed.
[00:55:19.566 --> 00:55:21.086]  And as a backup, we've got C-SPAN.
[00:55:21.106 --> 00:55:28.908]  We're going to be analyzing the mainstream media and critiquing that, because this is a major public event, but we officially do have our own feed.
[00:55:29.168 --> 00:55:30.748]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[00:55:30.988 --> 00:55:35.309]  Spread the link to everyone right now, InfoWars.com forward slash show, or the YouTube link.
[00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:36.230]  Get everybody tuning in.
[00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:37.630]  It's a revolution of new media.
[00:55:39.124 --> 00:55:48.227]  There can now be no doubt the dinosaur establishment corporate media that represents the Republicans and Democrats in this nation is in free fall.
[00:55:48.887 --> 00:55:56.630]  And Donald Trump is simply a focal point or a bellwether illustrating the fact that nationalism and populism is rising.
[00:55:57.430 --> 00:56:08.094]  And at the heart of this fight is InfoWars.com and my syndicated radio broadcast and nightly news transmission, as well as our films, the news articles that our great investigative journalists write every day.
[00:56:08.594 --> 00:56:12.175]  And of course, you the listeners and viewers of InfoWars.
[00:56:12.695 --> 00:56:17.797]  You are the true heart, the true blood, the sinew, the bone, the brains, the guts.
[00:56:18.698 --> 00:56:22.379]  You are the embodiment of Americana and the resistance to tyranny.
[00:56:23.707 --> 00:56:33.196]  Info warriors of every race, color, and creed who have red blood coursing through their veins are unified by their love of basic liberty and human empowerment.
[00:56:34.588 --> 00:56:40.773]  You are the individuals that have bought the high quality products at InfoWarsStore.com over the years and supported our sponsors.
[00:56:41.153 --> 00:56:54.664]  And that's why to mark this historic debate with roughly 100 million viewers set to tune in, we are going to offer, before, during, and after our coverage, free shipping store-wide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:56:55.225 --> 00:57:01.029]  We're also going to be premiering the introduction of the new flagship product at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:57:02.615 --> 00:57:05.616]  InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:11.137]  I've been involved with supplements, nutraceuticals for almost my entire career in media.
[00:57:12.017 --> 00:57:20.539]  And in the last five years, since we launched InfoWars Life, we have had thousands of emails and callers ask, why don't you have a probiotic?
[00:57:20.899 --> 00:57:24.680]  The jewel in the crown of any nutraceutical lineup.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.101]  And the answer is simple.
[00:57:27.521 --> 00:57:31.582]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality
[00:57:32.652 --> 00:57:41.537]  Known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[00:57:42.478 --> 00:57:53.724]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[00:57:54.364 --> 00:58:00.328]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[00:58:00.888 --> 00:58:03.509]  Look, I'm not telling you some secret here.
[00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:07.950]  Probiotics is turning the tide against the globalist assault on our bodies.
[00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:15.131]  And so that's why we didn't give viewers, unless there's some quick fix or private label, some other probiotic that was out there.
[00:58:15.712 --> 00:58:25.454]  We went out and worked for year after year after year with the top experts to produce the ultimate fusion of proven probiotics at an extremely affordable price.

[00:58:40.256 --> 00:58:42.137]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:58:42.277 --> 00:58:48.278]  It is 8 o'clock as we speak, Central Standard Time, 9 o'clock Eastern, in Hofstra, New York at the Hofstra University.
[00:58:48.619 --> 00:58:49.339]  They're about to launch.
[00:58:49.379 --> 00:58:51.159]  Lester Holt is having a technical difficulty.
[00:58:51.419 --> 00:58:54.380]  We can punch that up full screen for TV viewers, please, from our stream.
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.921]  So that's why we have this stream behind the scenes.
[00:58:56.941 --> 00:58:57.701]  We also have C-SPAN.
[00:58:57.941 --> 00:58:59.102]  We can go to our stream behind us.
[00:58:59.422 --> 00:59:02.583]  So they're fixing his coat, fixing his jacket, fixing his earpiece.
[00:59:03.063 --> 00:59:04.563]  Not that he's getting orders like Hillary is.
[00:59:05.564 --> 00:59:09.365]  By the way, the Election Commission wouldn't answer whether she had an earpiece or not or whether that was okay.
[00:59:09.645 --> 00:59:11.927]  He's about to introduce them, about to bring them out.
[00:59:12.007 --> 00:59:19.511]  I'm going to give a limited commentary and analysis and critique under the First Amendment here, but we do have our own feed as well, but of mainstream media.
[00:59:19.531 --> 00:59:24.995]  So we're fusing all this together as citizen journalists, true grassroots, dominating the honestware media.
[00:59:25.315 --> 00:59:34.601]  And then we're going to come back again, as I said, with fact-checking with clips throughout the 90 minutes that will be posted at InfoWars.com with short highlights and clips to spread and go viral.
[00:59:34.621 --> 00:59:35.642]  And then we'll be back for
[00:59:35.922 --> 00:59:36.322]  We're good to go.
[01:00:00.516 --> 01:00:05.459]  I mean, look, she's very evil, very powerful.
[01:00:05.479 --> 01:00:09.802]  She'd be very capable with her, you know, her brain and stamina, she said, if she wasn't evil.
[01:00:10.382 --> 01:00:12.344]  I'd vote for a woman right now if she was a patriot.
[01:00:12.564 --> 01:00:14.405]  I'd care less, you know, what their genitals are.
[01:00:14.465 --> 01:00:18.768]  But if you sit here, or how long their hair is or whatever, if you sit here and you look at this,
[01:00:20.028 --> 01:00:21.609]  She's been having coughing fits.
[01:00:21.629 --> 01:00:22.830]  She had to cancel events for a week.
[01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:23.791]  She fell down.
[01:00:23.851 --> 01:00:24.912]  She's got serious illnesses.
[01:00:25.192 --> 01:00:30.295]  The fact she's ready to be up there for the next 90 minutes.
[01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:30.976]  This is amazing.
[01:00:30.996 --> 01:00:32.176]  So we're now two minutes into this.
[01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:34.018]  It's 8.02 Central Time.
[01:00:34.658 --> 01:00:38.000]  And we've got the votes up there with 12,000 plus votes.
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:43.804]  Will she cancel debates, suffer coughing fit or collapse or sail through with ease?
[01:00:44.284 --> 01:00:45.125]  And let's see the results.
[01:00:45.345 --> 01:00:45.986]  Can we vote there?
[01:00:46.526 --> 01:00:49.008]  I saw earlier the majority said that
[01:00:49.968 --> 01:00:54.670]  Uh, it was, uh, the 47% were saying, they believe, earlier when I looked at it, that it was coughing fits.
[01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:56.970]  So, we're now more than two minutes into this.
[01:00:57.490 --> 01:00:58.791]  Uh, Leanne, what do you think's going on?
[01:00:58.811 --> 01:01:00.131]  They normally kick it right off.
[01:01:00.211 --> 01:01:01.652]  I mean, Holt's not even talking.
[01:01:01.672 --> 01:01:02.152]  What's happening?
[01:01:02.272 --> 01:01:07.654]  Well, you know, that maybe they're, Hillary needs a little bit more time to get into her pantsuit after her bathroom break.
[01:01:07.774 --> 01:01:08.434]  Diaper change?
[01:01:08.734 --> 01:01:09.274]  Yeah, you know, maybe.
[01:01:09.294 --> 01:01:10.174]  Diaper change station?
[01:01:10.194 --> 01:01:16.316]  A little powdering, a little powdering off to get her prepared, or she couldn't button all the buttons on her Chairman Mao outfit.
[01:01:16.336 --> 01:01:17.657]  Is she not degenerating quickly?
[01:01:18.317 --> 01:01:26.501]  You know, she's only 5'4", so I don't know that much about fashion, but a tiny person like that should not be swimming in tents.
[01:01:27.101 --> 01:01:28.181]  You know, why does she do that?
[01:01:28.221 --> 01:01:31.283]  She looks like some commander of, like, a starship or something.
[01:01:31.923 --> 01:01:33.924]  I think that's what she's, you know... Absolutely.
[01:01:33.964 --> 01:01:36.725]  Let's pipe in some of the audio of our own feed behind us.
[01:01:36.765 --> 01:01:40.747]  Let's go with this feed, and then we've got C-SPAN over here that we're watching and analyzing.
[01:01:41.187 --> 01:01:42.228]  Oh, look, there's Don King.
[01:01:42.268 --> 01:01:43.769]  I can see his little sparkly jacket.
[01:01:43.929 --> 01:01:45.791]  You ran into him at the, uh... Yeah, we interviewed him.
[01:01:45.831 --> 01:01:52.096]  I was gonna say something like, you know, the Republicans tried to stage this election and steal the nomination like one of your boxing matches, but it didn't work.
[01:01:52.496 --> 01:01:54.798]  So are you happy they couldn't game this, but I just didn't do it.
[01:01:55.459 --> 01:01:55.699]  Yeah.
[01:01:55.819 --> 01:01:57.340]  And, uh, it's like Charlie Rose.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.181]  I wasn't mean to him.
[01:01:58.201 --> 01:02:01.344]  I asked him a Bilderberg question, but... He said, you're my favorite globalist.
[01:02:01.744 --> 01:02:04.049]  Yeah, he was like, I really like your style.
[01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:05.032]  That's how he opened the whole deal.
[01:02:05.052 --> 01:02:07.798]  It's not that I'm going to be his buddy or compromise with him.
[01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:08.961]  I feel sorry for these people.
[01:02:09.302 --> 01:02:10.404]  They're the old world.
[01:02:10.464 --> 01:02:11.547]  They're the old sellouts.
[01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:13.811]  We have the results.
[01:02:13.851 --> 01:02:15.132]  Let's put the results up.
[01:02:15.613 --> 01:02:17.355]  What are the people deciding?
[01:02:17.395 --> 01:02:18.096]  I told you hours ago.
[01:02:18.196 --> 01:02:18.576]  It was 44%.
[01:02:18.716 --> 01:02:19.917]  She will suffer a coughing fit.
[01:02:19.937 --> 01:02:22.540]  9% cancel debate.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.601]  27% collapse.
[01:02:23.621 --> 01:02:24.622]  20% sail through.
[01:02:24.843 --> 01:02:26.044]  Alright, Lester Holt is on.
[01:02:26.524 --> 01:02:28.447]  Let's go to our feed.
[01:02:28.467 --> 01:02:29.448]  Here he is.
[01:02:30.128 --> 01:02:33.071]  The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[01:02:33.939 --> 01:02:39.371]  This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a non-partisan, non-profit organization.
[01:02:39.992 --> 01:02:44.522]  The Commission drafted tonight's format and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.
[01:02:45.526 --> 01:02:50.168]  The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 50 minutes long.
[01:02:50.628 --> 01:02:58.030]  We'll explore three topic areas tonight, Achieving Prosperity, America's Direction, and Securing America.
[01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:05.352]  At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond.
[01:03:06.053 --> 01:03:09.354]  From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.
[01:03:10.194 --> 01:03:14.135]  The questions are mine and have not been shared with the Commission or the campaigns.
[01:03:14.775 --> 01:03:20.337]  The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.
[01:03:20.837 --> 01:03:25.158]  I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment as we welcome the candidates.
[01:03:25.658 --> 01:03:34.300]  Democratic nominee for President of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
[01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:44.213]  It's funny how they're wearing the opposing color.
[01:03:44.313 --> 01:03:44.934]  Interesting.
[01:03:44.974 --> 01:03:50.477]  Look at that power.
[01:03:50.557 --> 01:03:51.738]  Trump's the real deal.
[01:03:55.669 --> 01:03:56.510]  He's not out to get America.
[01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:57.371]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[01:03:57.631 --> 01:03:59.193]  This is a sit back, limited comment.
[01:03:59.493 --> 01:04:00.874]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:04:00.894 --> 01:04:01.315]  Spread the link.
[01:04:12.606 --> 01:04:14.027]  And we're going to press for specifics.
[01:04:14.568 --> 01:04:20.132]  I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and just as important to the American people.
[01:04:20.652 --> 01:04:26.717]  Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values.
[01:04:27.658 --> 01:04:29.159]  So, let's begin.
[01:04:30.282 --> 01:04:35.464]  We're calling this opening segment Achieving Prosperity, and central to that is jobs.
[01:04:35.924 --> 01:04:38.726]  There are two economic realities in America today.
[01:04:38.766 --> 01:04:47.069]  There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation.
[01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:53.812]  However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[01:04:54.432 --> 01:05:02.925]  Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of Americans?
[01:05:02.945 --> 01:05:03.826]  She's the author of this.
[01:05:04.027 --> 01:05:07.892]  Thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.
[01:05:08.931 --> 01:05:16.576]  The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.
[01:05:16.596 --> 01:05:21.359]  Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.403]  First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.
[01:05:27.083 --> 01:05:31.526]  That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.
[01:05:31.546 --> 01:05:33.047]  I want us to invest in you.
[01:05:33.447 --> 01:05:35.228]  I want us to invest in your future.
[01:05:35.688 --> 01:05:47.136]  That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, in innovation and technology, clean renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.
[01:05:47.736 --> 01:05:50.137]  We also have to make the economy secure.
[01:05:50.237 --> 01:05:53.299]  That starts with raising the national minimum wage.
[01:05:56.101 --> 01:05:56.602]  Finally!
[01:05:56.622 --> 01:06:02.453]  Ain't no talking points coming down here from anywhere.
[01:06:02.533 --> 01:06:03.996]  That's all they've been doing is targeting them.
[01:06:04.016 --> 01:06:05.358]  They want consolidation control.
[01:06:05.458 --> 01:06:07.763]  Not just the executives at the top.
[01:06:08.823 --> 01:06:15.009]  And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.
[01:06:15.789 --> 01:06:21.975]  I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.
[01:06:22.315 --> 01:06:23.937]  So let's have paid family leave.
[01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:25.018]  Earn sick leave.
[01:06:25.038 --> 01:06:27.260]  Well, she's been on the payroll, the con is Chinese.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.861]  Childcare and debt-free college.
[01:06:28.881 --> 01:06:29.722]  Childcare in China?
[01:06:29.762 --> 01:06:31.023]  Send your kid up to PowerPoll.
[01:06:31.043 --> 01:06:34.927]  By having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.
[01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:40.503]  The corporate loopholes of having higher taxes here than in China?
[01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:44.071]  Donald, it's good to be with you.
[01:06:44.331 --> 01:06:46.392]  Oh look, she's so friendly, she's a real human.
[01:06:46.412 --> 01:06:47.892]  He's a sweet little grandma.
[01:06:47.912 --> 01:06:51.313]  We are talking about the importance of exercising our country.
[01:06:51.513 --> 01:06:52.113]  She's not a war criminal.
[01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:52.934]  She didn't run narcotics.
[01:06:53.354 --> 01:06:57.635]  She didn't brag about killing Gaddafi when he was coming in to give up.
[01:06:58.375 --> 01:07:01.997]  Who can put into action the plans that will make your life better?
[01:07:02.117 --> 01:07:02.937]  Of the globalists and rapists?
[01:07:02.957 --> 01:07:03.497]  You, we're sure of that.
[01:07:03.517 --> 01:07:06.098]  I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.
[01:07:07.577 --> 01:07:09.619]  Secretary Clinton, thank you for your comments.
[01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:10.741]  What country is better off?
[01:07:10.761 --> 01:07:10.981]  Here we go.
[01:07:11.041 --> 01:07:13.524]  It's about putting more money into the pockets of American workers.
[01:07:13.544 --> 01:07:14.385]  You have up to two minutes.
[01:07:14.665 --> 01:07:15.306]  Thank you, Lester.
[01:07:15.326 --> 01:07:16.086]  We've got to control ourselves.
[01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:18.409]  Our jobs are fleeing the country.
[01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:20.431]  They're going to Mexico.
[01:07:20.451 --> 01:07:22.193]  They're going to many other countries.
[01:07:22.674 --> 01:07:26.157]  You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.
[01:07:26.778 --> 01:07:31.179]  They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.080]  And we have a very good fight, and we have a winning fight.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:39.222]  Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China.
[01:07:39.662 --> 01:07:41.322]  And many other countries are doing the same thing.
[01:07:41.342 --> 01:07:42.923]  See, what Trump just did was bring in real issues.
[01:07:42.943 --> 01:07:43.763]  China has a 35% tariff.
[01:07:43.783 --> 01:07:45.624]  Trump tells the truth about China raping us.
[01:07:45.644 --> 01:07:46.124]  That's the clip.
[01:07:46.164 --> 01:07:46.564]  It's the truth.
[01:07:46.584 --> 01:07:46.924]  It's a fact.
[01:07:46.944 --> 01:07:47.224]  Fact check.
[01:07:47.244 --> 01:07:47.744]  Total truth.
[01:07:47.764 --> 01:07:48.805]  That's the first clip.
[01:07:48.825 --> 01:07:49.405]  Put that out.
[01:07:56.607 --> 01:07:59.688]  With the United States, as he said, not so much.
[01:08:00.388 --> 01:08:01.649]  So, Ford is leaving.
[01:08:02.109 --> 01:08:04.690]  You see that, their small car division, leaving.
[01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:06.431]  They've sold us thousands of jobs.
[01:08:06.671 --> 01:08:08.572]  Leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.
[01:08:09.292 --> 01:08:10.072]  They're all leaving.
[01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:11.313]  The raping's continuing.
[01:08:11.333 --> 01:08:13.093]  That thing got screwed, it didn't make it better.
[01:08:13.113 --> 01:08:14.994]  Childcare is concerned and so many other things.
[01:08:15.054 --> 01:08:17.015]  I think Hillary and I agree on that.
[01:08:17.575 --> 01:08:24.718]  We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.
[01:08:25.498 --> 01:08:29.839]  But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.
[01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:30.960]  We have to- No brainer!
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.060]  He's not out to screw us!
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:37.021]  He doesn't want to make us poor, Cloward and Piven!
[01:08:37.061 --> 01:08:38.102]  He just isn't out to screw us!
[01:08:38.222 --> 01:08:39.162]  That'll be his campaign!
[01:08:39.222 --> 01:08:40.302]  I'm not here to F you!
[01:08:40.322 --> 01:08:40.882]  I love Trump!
[01:08:41.082 --> 01:08:41.823]  Hug the big F!
[01:08:46.624 --> 01:08:49.605]  So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.
[01:08:50.346 --> 01:08:51.466]  We cannot let this happen.
[01:08:51.486 --> 01:08:52.547]  Look at this man, he's so good!
[01:08:52.567 --> 01:08:56.869]  In my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously.
[01:08:57.269 --> 01:09:01.551]  From 35% to 15% for companies, small and big businesses.
[01:09:02.031 --> 01:09:05.993]  That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.
[01:09:06.033 --> 01:09:08.854]  It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.
[01:09:08.894 --> 01:09:13.636]  Companies will come, they will grow, they will expand, new companies will start.
[01:09:14.056 --> 01:09:16.199]  And I look very, very much forward to doing it.
[01:09:16.259 --> 01:09:21.346]  We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our jobs.
[01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:23.870]  Hillary goes and negotiates it and gets $50 million for herself.
[01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:24.491]  Screwing us!
[01:09:24.511 --> 01:09:25.312]  She's a damn traitor!
[01:09:25.868 --> 01:09:28.289]  Well, I think that trade is an important issue.
[01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:29.230]  Yes, damned trader!
[01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:31.311]  We are 5% of the world's population.
[01:09:31.351 --> 01:09:32.411]  We have to trade with the other 95%.
[01:09:32.751 --> 01:09:34.212]  She's not crooked, Hillary.
[01:09:34.232 --> 01:09:35.352]  She's damned, Hillary.
[01:09:35.392 --> 01:09:38.394]  That's why you liked the TPP up until you decided to run for president.
[01:09:38.414 --> 01:09:40.915]  We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work.
[01:09:40.935 --> 01:09:41.715]  She wrote the thing.
[01:09:41.735 --> 01:09:42.216]  Oh, that's why she did it.
[01:09:42.236 --> 01:09:43.676]  And not just financial transactions.
[01:09:43.836 --> 01:09:45.037]  Make it impossible to do business here.
[01:09:45.057 --> 01:09:46.858]  And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth.
[01:09:47.418 --> 01:09:49.699]  Would be trickle-down economics all over again.
[01:09:49.779 --> 01:09:58.224]  In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country that we've ever had.
[01:09:58.825 --> 01:10:03.407]  I call it trumped-up trickle-down because that's exactly what it would be.
[01:10:03.927 --> 01:10:06.249]  That is not how we grow the economy.
[01:10:06.849 --> 01:10:08.070]  We just have a different view.
[01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:11.092]  About what's best for growing the economy.
[01:10:11.152 --> 01:10:15.274]  How we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.
[01:10:15.715 --> 01:10:18.777]  I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.
[01:10:19.637 --> 01:10:20.578]  I understand that.
[01:10:20.998 --> 01:10:26.182]  You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit.
[01:10:26.862 --> 01:10:27.603]  Class warfare!
[01:10:29.844 --> 01:10:35.369]  Man, she stole hundreds of millions, steals Haitian refugee money, Haitian flood victims.
[01:10:35.869 --> 01:10:39.873]  This woman robs little kids, and then trumps bad for building hotels.
[01:10:39.893 --> 01:10:41.374]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:10:41.734 --> 01:10:42.995]  I call her on that.
[01:10:43.075 --> 01:10:44.537]  I call her on class warfare.
[01:10:44.577 --> 01:10:45.998]  That's class warfare right there.
[01:10:46.378 --> 01:10:49.441]  Yeah, Obama started the race war, she's gonna start the class war.
[01:10:49.741 --> 01:10:50.282]  An all sexist war.
[01:10:50.362 --> 01:10:50.682]  Oh yeah.
[01:10:50.702 --> 01:10:51.963]  She's been saying this for 30 years.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.142]  Let me follow up on Mr. Trump if I can.
[01:11:10.182 --> 01:11:16.570]  You've talked about creating 25 million jobs and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.
[01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:21.636]  How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?
[01:11:21.676 --> 01:11:25.821]  How specifically are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?
[01:11:26.121 --> 01:11:37.756]  Well, for one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars with some of the greatest assets in the world.
[01:11:38.156 --> 01:11:41.220]  And I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.362]  Our country's in deep trouble.
[01:11:43.042 --> 01:11:49.126]  We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.
[01:11:49.166 --> 01:11:51.767]  They're the best, the best ever at it.
[01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:55.650]  What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.
[01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:56.990]  So we have to do that.
[01:11:57.051 --> 01:11:58.892]  We have to renegotiate our trade deals.
[01:11:58.972 --> 01:12:03.975]  Unless they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that frankly we don't do.
[01:12:04.795 --> 01:12:06.416]  Let me give you the example of Mexico.
[01:12:06.796 --> 01:12:07.637]  They have a VAT tax.
[01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:08.657]  We're in a different system.
[01:12:09.238 --> 01:12:10.899]  When we sell into Mexico,
[01:12:11.599 --> 01:12:16.144]  There's a tax when they sell in automatic, 16% approximately.
[01:12:16.484 --> 01:12:19.187]  When they sell into us, there's no tax.
[01:12:19.327 --> 01:12:20.989]  It's a defective agreement.
[01:12:21.469 --> 01:12:25.773]  It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.
[01:12:25.813 --> 01:12:28.816]  Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,
[01:12:29.858 --> 01:12:30.098]  Yes.
[01:12:30.118 --> 01:12:31.279]  Is that okay?
[01:12:31.459 --> 01:12:31.639]  Good.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.221]  I want you to be very happy.
[01:12:34.002 --> 01:12:34.923]  It's very important to me.
[01:12:35.383 --> 01:12:41.310]  But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.
[01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:42.812]  She's been doing this for 30 years.
[01:12:43.652 --> 01:12:45.555]  And why hasn't she made the agreements better?
[01:12:46.175 --> 01:12:50.958]  The NAFTA agreement is defective, just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the tax.
[01:12:50.978 --> 01:12:52.019]  Let me interrupt you for a moment.
[01:12:52.079 --> 01:12:57.122]  Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years.
[01:12:57.502 --> 01:12:58.303]  Not right now.
[01:12:58.323 --> 01:12:58.923]  She looks pretty genuine there.
[01:12:58.943 --> 01:12:59.784]  I don't know if she wrote that genuinely.
[01:12:59.824 --> 01:13:00.925]  She looks like she has a crush on him.
[01:13:00.945 --> 01:13:02.886]  They should have been doing this for years.
[01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:11.011]  What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is, look, we owe $20 trillion.
[01:13:12.472 --> 01:13:14.693]  We cannot do it any longer, Lester.
[01:13:14.713 --> 01:13:15.534]  Back to the question, though.
[01:13:15.554 --> 01:13:18.755]  How do you bring back, specifically bring back jobs?
[01:13:18.796 --> 01:13:21.397]  American manufacturers, how do you make them bring the jobs back?
[01:13:21.457 --> 01:13:23.378]  Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.
[01:13:24.058 --> 01:13:25.019]  The companies are leaving.
[01:13:25.039 --> 01:13:27.460]  I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.101]  They're leaving.
[01:13:28.241 --> 01:13:30.122]  And they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.
[01:13:30.962 --> 01:13:34.844]  And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country?
[01:13:34.904 --> 01:13:35.304]  Good luck.
[01:13:35.364 --> 01:13:36.265]  We wish you a lot of luck.
[01:13:36.805 --> 01:13:45.249]  But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.
[01:13:45.689 --> 01:13:54.673]  And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave.
[01:13:54.693 --> 01:13:54.973]  That's right.
[01:13:54.993 --> 01:13:56.874]  Because in many cases they own the companies.
[01:13:57.394 --> 01:13:58.975]  So what I'm saying is,
[01:13:59.395 --> 01:14:01.097]  We can stop them from leaving.
[01:14:01.377 --> 01:14:03.560]  We have to stop them from leaving.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.302]  And that's a big, big factor.
[01:14:05.362 --> 01:14:06.563]  Let me let Secretary Clinton... Wow.
[01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:07.464]  Key to everything.
[01:14:07.484 --> 01:14:11.489]  Let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.
[01:14:12.109 --> 01:14:15.753]  We had the worst financial crisis since the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.
[01:14:17.515 --> 01:14:32.083]  That was, in large part, because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.
[01:14:32.683 --> 01:14:36.665]  In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.
[01:14:37.226 --> 01:14:44.169]  He said, back in 2006, gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.
[01:14:44.249 --> 01:14:45.210]  Well, it did collapse.
[01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:48.891]  That's called business, by the way.
[01:14:48.911 --> 01:14:56.732]  9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million people lost their homes, and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.
[01:14:57.152 --> 01:15:02.373]  Now, we have come back from that abyss, and it has not been easy.
[01:15:02.793 --> 01:15:10.135]  So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do
[01:15:10.775 --> 01:15:14.818]  Go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.
[01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:39.298]  Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed, and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over five trillion dollars, and would, in some instances, disadvantage middle class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose three and a half million jobs.
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.362]  And maybe have another recession.
[01:15:42.402 --> 01:15:44.944]  The same independent experts that say she's ahead, even though she's not.
[01:15:45.044 --> 01:15:51.249]  Okay, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs.
[01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:55.532]  Because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.
[01:15:55.552 --> 01:15:57.534]  I'll hand it to her though, she looks healthier today than she did a week ago.
[01:15:57.554 --> 01:16:00.857]  Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.
[01:16:00.877 --> 01:16:02.098]  Unless she got one of those blood transfusions.
[01:16:02.618 --> 01:16:06.761]  Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.
[01:16:06.901 --> 01:16:07.641]  I think it's real.
[01:16:07.881 --> 01:16:08.442]  I did not.
[01:16:08.482 --> 01:16:09.222]  They don't follow it.
[01:16:09.242 --> 01:16:10.003]  It's a carbon tax.
[01:16:10.103 --> 01:16:16.167]  And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it both at home and abroad.
[01:16:16.207 --> 01:16:16.947]  And here's what we can do.
[01:16:17.367 --> 01:16:19.849]  We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.
[01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:22.991]  We can have enough clean energy to power every home.
[01:16:23.471 --> 01:16:26.233]  We can build a new modern electric grid.
[01:16:26.273 --> 01:16:27.314]  That's a lot of jobs.
[01:16:27.354 --> 01:16:29.536]  That's a lot of new economic activity.
[01:16:29.856 --> 01:16:39.423]  So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again.
[01:16:39.903 --> 01:16:45.748]  Building on the progress we've made over the last eight years but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.
[01:16:46.388 --> 01:16:47.950]  She talks about solar panels.
[01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:50.753]  We invested in a solar company, our country.
[01:16:50.793 --> 01:16:51.814]  That was a disaster.
[01:16:51.914 --> 01:16:53.356]  They lost plenty of money on that one.
[01:16:53.857 --> 01:16:58.142]  Now look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy.
[01:16:58.662 --> 01:17:00.604]  But we're putting a lot of people out of work.
[01:17:00.665 --> 01:17:02.447]  Our energy policies are a disaster.
[01:17:02.987 --> 01:17:07.690]  Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.
[01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:11.533]  You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.
[01:17:12.033 --> 01:17:20.638]  The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years worth of debt, and he's topped it.
[01:17:20.898 --> 01:17:26.142]  He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven and a half years to be semi-exact.
[01:17:26.502 --> 01:17:27.503]  So I will tell you this.
[01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:33.365]  We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.
[01:17:33.725 --> 01:17:40.567]  And we have to do a much better job at getting companies incentive to build new companies or to expand because they're not doing it.
[01:17:40.807 --> 01:17:52.531]  And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.
[01:17:53.092 --> 01:17:56.553]  And Hillary, I just ask you this, you've been doing this
[01:17:57.293 --> 01:17:58.154]  For 30 years.
[01:17:58.614 --> 01:18:01.035]  Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?
[01:18:01.096 --> 01:18:05.118]  For 30 years you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.
[01:18:06.539 --> 01:18:08.440]  I will bring back jobs.
[01:18:08.961 --> 01:18:09.901]  You can't bring back jobs.
[01:18:09.921 --> 01:18:13.183]  Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.
[01:18:13.443 --> 01:18:13.864]  Yeah, for 30 years.
[01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:18.907]  Yeah, your email show, you're talking to the Chinese president, selling us out.
[01:18:18.967 --> 01:18:21.029]  I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.
[01:18:21.149 --> 01:18:24.292]  I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again.
[01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:25.293]  Oh yeah, devaluing the currency?
[01:18:25.313 --> 01:18:26.253]  Well, he approved NAFTA.
[01:18:26.273 --> 01:18:31.517]  A million new jobs, a balanced budget, and incomes went up for everybody.
[01:18:31.858 --> 01:18:33.539]  Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s.
[01:18:33.719 --> 01:18:36.381]  Because you created the debt we're under now, lady.
[01:18:36.882 --> 01:18:43.147]  When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.
[01:18:44.258 --> 01:18:45.799]  Will they create jobs in America?
[01:18:46.119 --> 01:18:47.580]  Will they raise incomes in America?
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.561]  Can we get more jobs, lady?
[01:18:48.661 --> 01:18:50.342]  For our national security.
[01:18:50.442 --> 01:18:51.022]  Proofs in the pudding!
[01:18:51.042 --> 01:18:52.083]  Some of them I voted for.
[01:18:52.103 --> 01:18:56.125]  The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.
[01:18:56.846 --> 01:19:01.629]  And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.
[01:19:01.649 --> 01:19:02.449]  Can we read the trade agreements?
[01:19:02.809 --> 01:19:03.009]  No.
[01:19:03.069 --> 01:19:03.570]  Let's not.
[01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:08.591]  Assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.
[01:19:09.251 --> 01:19:12.092]  I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.
[01:19:12.132 --> 01:19:13.672]  I'm going to have a special prosecutor.
[01:19:14.053 --> 01:19:18.234]  We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.
[01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:20.514]  Could they enforce national security laws on your servers, emails?
[01:19:20.554 --> 01:19:23.615]  We actually increased American exports globally 30%.
[01:19:24.095 --> 01:19:27.276]  We know Obama appointed your prosecutor, Loretta Lynch.
[01:19:27.336 --> 01:19:27.616]  Sorry.
[01:19:27.936 --> 01:19:35.720]  So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that help to create more new jobs.
[01:19:44.804 --> 01:19:45.705]  Well that's your opinion.
[01:19:45.765 --> 01:19:46.425]  That is your opinion.
[01:20:14.824 --> 01:20:15.865]  Man, it's so truthful.
[01:20:16.485 --> 01:20:17.566]  All I do is study this.
[01:20:17.766 --> 01:20:18.547]  The public doesn't.
[01:20:18.567 --> 01:20:22.290]  This guy is incredible.
[01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:24.892]  That is just not accurate.
[01:20:25.292 --> 01:20:26.353]  You're a damn liar.
[01:20:26.433 --> 01:20:26.914]  I'm sorry.
[01:20:26.934 --> 01:20:27.554]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:20:27.594 --> 01:20:28.154]  Turn my mic off.
[01:20:28.175 --> 01:20:31.777]  It was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.
[01:20:31.837 --> 01:20:33.659]  I wrote about that in... You called it gold?
[01:20:34.039 --> 01:20:35.180]  This is so smart.
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.562]  He called it the gold standard of trade deals.
[01:20:37.602 --> 01:20:40.004]  He said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.
[01:20:40.024 --> 01:20:43.147]  And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.
[01:20:43.167 --> 01:20:44.048]  This is a real debate.
[01:20:44.088 --> 01:20:45.209]  I'm not going to turn my mic off.
[01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.489]  Turn it off.
[01:20:45.529 --> 01:20:46.290]  I'm not talking for 20 minutes.
[01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.810]  Turn it off.
[01:20:47.111 --> 01:20:47.671]  This is a real debate.
[01:20:47.691 --> 01:20:48.892]  I'm going to fact check.
[01:20:48.932 --> 01:20:54.958]  I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated, which I was not responsible for,
[01:20:55.618 --> 01:20:57.019]  I concluded it wasn't.
[01:20:57.119 --> 01:20:59.500]  I wrote about that in my book before you even announced.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:02.202]  So is it President Obama's fault?
[01:21:02.942 --> 01:21:06.044]  Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?
[01:21:06.124 --> 01:21:07.124]  Because he's pushing it.
[01:21:07.164 --> 01:21:13.568]  There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.
[01:21:14.108 --> 01:21:18.610]  And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.
[01:21:18.650 --> 01:21:26.755]  That's why I said, new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.
[01:21:26.795 --> 01:21:28.055]  But you have no plan.
[01:21:28.075 --> 01:21:28.416]  Oh, I do.
[01:21:28.436 --> 01:21:29.716]  Secretary, you have no plan.
[01:21:29.756 --> 01:21:32.678]  In fact, I have written a book about it.
[01:21:32.818 --> 01:21:33.898]  It's called Stronger Together.
[01:21:33.918 --> 01:21:34.919]  You can pick it up tomorrow.
[01:21:34.939 --> 01:21:36.320]  No, her plan is more of the same.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:39.421]  She's a Chinese agent.
[01:21:39.501 --> 01:21:45.283]  But it's because I see this, we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.
[01:21:45.663 --> 01:21:52.726]  We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.
[01:21:52.986 --> 01:21:59.208]  So we have a very robust family plan, and people have looked at both of our plans.
[01:21:59.448 --> 01:22:03.573]  You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.
[01:22:03.593 --> 01:22:05.976]  You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.
[01:22:15.027 --> 01:22:16.988]  You are going to drive business out.
[01:22:17.448 --> 01:22:22.011]  Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.
[01:22:22.111 --> 01:22:26.093]  And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.
[01:22:26.153 --> 01:22:27.013]  I'm very proud of it.
[01:22:27.774 --> 01:22:29.935]  It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.
[01:22:30.075 --> 01:22:34.557]  But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.
[01:22:34.837 --> 01:22:39.420]  When I go around, Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over, and when I go around,
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:23:06.709]  Despite the tax cut the thing the things that business as a total presidential material right there is the fact that I'm cutting regulation you have regulations on top of regulations and new companies cannot form and Old companies are going out of business and you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse I'm gonna cut regulations But I'm going to cut taxes big league and you're gonna raise taxes big league end of story
[01:23:06.749 --> 01:23:10.010]  Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into the next segment.
[01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:10.990]  We're going to talk taxes.
[01:23:11.031 --> 01:23:12.671]  That can't be left to stand.
[01:23:12.751 --> 01:23:17.073]  I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims.
[01:23:17.093 --> 01:23:17.813]  She wants a 65% tax.
[01:23:17.833 --> 01:23:19.013]  How about move to France?
[01:23:19.093 --> 01:23:19.393]  Fact!
[01:23:19.473 --> 01:23:26.836]  We have taken the homepage of my website, hillaryclinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact checker.
[01:23:26.896 --> 01:23:30.477]  So if you want to see in real time what the facts are, please go and take a look.
[01:23:32.278 --> 01:23:34.340]  Here's a box of cat letters or fact checkers.
[01:23:50.515 --> 01:23:57.721]  By raising taxes on the wealthy because they have made all the gains in the economy.
[01:23:57.741 --> 01:23:58.622]  We're 25 minutes in.
[01:23:58.642 --> 01:23:59.523]  Has she had a seizure yet?
[01:23:59.563 --> 01:24:02.485]  The wealthy corporations paid their fair share to support this party.
[01:24:02.505 --> 01:24:03.806]  Well, you just opened the next segment.
[01:24:03.866 --> 01:24:05.388]  And the big bankers wrote all this.
[01:24:05.428 --> 01:24:06.589]  We need to get out of taxes.
[01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:08.190]  And look at her website.
[01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:09.831]  And you take a look at her website.
[01:24:10.072 --> 01:24:11.353]  She's going to raise taxes.
[01:24:11.373 --> 01:24:13.515]  1.3 trillion dollars.
[01:24:13.555 --> 01:24:14.696]  And look at her website.
[01:24:15.356 --> 01:24:15.697]  You know what?
[01:24:15.737 --> 01:24:16.858]  It's no different than this.
[01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:18.681]  She's telling us how to fight ISIS?
[01:24:18.901 --> 01:24:20.042]  Just go to her website.
[01:24:20.062 --> 01:24:22.085]  She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.
[01:24:22.406 --> 01:24:24.909]  I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that to him.
[01:24:24.949 --> 01:24:26.892]  Big money hates Trump!
[01:24:26.932 --> 01:24:30.036]  Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.
[01:24:30.056 --> 01:24:31.217]  Yeah, you run them, you monster.
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:33.741]  No, we're not.
[01:24:33.761 --> 01:24:36.203]  See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.
[01:24:36.323 --> 01:24:41.349]  No wonder you've been fighting, no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.
[01:24:41.369 --> 01:24:43.611]  She damn started them, look at her.
[01:24:44.132 --> 01:24:46.835]  Go to the, please, the fact checkers, get to work.
[01:24:46.855 --> 01:24:48.617]  Go to the fact checkers, go to Snopes.
[01:24:48.897 --> 01:24:49.758]  Go to the cat box!
[01:25:08.254 --> 01:25:13.680]  Well I'm really calling for major jobs because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs.
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:15.242]  They're going to expand their companies.
[01:25:15.502 --> 01:25:17.004]  They're going to do a tremendous job.
[01:25:17.344 --> 01:25:23.251]  I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision and if you really look it's not a tax, it's really not a great thing.
[01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:27.812]  It's a great thing for the wealthy, it's a great thing for middle class, it's a great thing for companies to expand.
[01:25:28.212 --> 01:25:46.376]  And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring two and a half trillion dollars back from overseas where they can't bring the money back because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape.
[01:25:46.696 --> 01:25:47.696]  So what is so bad?
[01:25:47.956 --> 01:25:57.399]  So what they're doing is they're leaving our country and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.
[01:25:57.419 --> 01:25:58.019]  Which was done on purpose.
[01:25:58.039 --> 01:26:00.139]  And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work.
[01:26:00.159 --> 01:26:00.480]  That's globalism.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:04.140]  Because they can't work out a deal to, and everybody agrees it should be brought back.
[01:26:04.181 --> 01:26:05.881]  Nobody can beat us, so they did this.
[01:26:06.281 --> 01:26:06.581]  That's gross.
[01:26:06.601 --> 01:26:07.462]  Economically.
[01:26:21.929 --> 01:26:25.452]  Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done.
[01:26:25.632 --> 01:26:26.413]  Two and a half trillion.
[01:26:26.733 --> 01:26:28.114]  I happen to think it's double that.
[01:26:28.134 --> 01:26:32.558]  It's probably five trillion dollars that we can't bring into our country, Lester.
[01:26:33.038 --> 01:26:37.021]  And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly.
[01:26:37.382 --> 01:26:39.964]  And it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things.
[01:26:39.984 --> 01:26:42.265]  Trump will just tell you they're out to screw you on purpose.
[01:26:42.285 --> 01:26:42.766]  It's beyond that.
[01:26:42.786 --> 01:26:43.747]  We have no leadership.
[01:26:43.847 --> 01:26:46.489]  And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.
[01:26:46.769 --> 01:26:47.149]  I admit it!
[01:26:47.249 --> 01:26:50.891]  Alright, you have two minutes on the same question to defend... They write books about it!
[01:26:50.911 --> 01:26:52.792]  ...the wealthiest American, Secretary Clinton.
[01:26:52.972 --> 01:26:57.234]  I have a feeling that by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.
[01:26:57.255 --> 01:26:57.635]  Why not?
[01:26:57.695 --> 01:26:59.015]  Her voice sounds different now.
[01:26:59.256 --> 01:27:01.837]  She's starting to have a little wobbly.
[01:27:01.977 --> 01:27:04.899]  You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.
[01:27:04.919 --> 01:27:06.079]  28 minutes in, she's starting to wobble.
[01:27:06.419 --> 01:27:13.243]  Now, let me say... There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into this country.
[01:27:13.263 --> 01:27:14.964]  This is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.
[01:27:15.629 --> 01:27:17.440]  Yeah, well let's start the clock again, Lester.
[01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:22.030]  We've looked at your tax proposals.
[01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:34.120]  I don't see changes in corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:41.026]  I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.
[01:27:41.987 --> 01:27:45.289]  But when I look at what you have proposed, you have
[01:27:46.212 --> 01:27:52.257]  What is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.
[01:27:52.838 --> 01:28:00.744]  You've proposed an approach that has a $4 billion tax benefit for your family.
[01:28:01.345 --> 01:28:08.111]  And when you look at what you are proposing, it is, as I said, trumped up, trickle down.
[01:28:08.551 --> 01:28:10.292]  Trickle down did not work.
[01:28:11.073 --> 01:28:14.776]  It got us into the mess we were in in 2008 and 2009.
[01:28:15.697 --> 01:28:18.519]  Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.
[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:22.182]  And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.
[01:28:22.683 --> 01:28:30.109]  And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.
[01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:33.031]  The ultra-rich created globalism to exempt themselves.
[01:28:33.171 --> 01:28:33.812]  Period.
[01:28:33.832 --> 01:28:35.613]  Trump's trying to break that.
[01:28:35.633 --> 01:28:36.133]  Period.
[01:28:36.153 --> 01:28:36.514]  Briefly.
[01:28:36.554 --> 01:28:37.014]  Day to night.
[01:28:37.074 --> 01:28:39.316]  You want to jump in during this lying harping?
[01:28:39.396 --> 01:28:43.479]  And again, folks, if you want coverage without us talking over it, we're giving limited analysis, that's fine.
[01:28:43.579 --> 01:28:44.720]  Everybody else has it.
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:46.842]  But we're here talking over this damn liar.
[01:28:46.942 --> 01:28:48.243]  You're in fact checking live.
[01:28:48.263 --> 01:28:48.603]  Day to night.
[01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:49.564]  Briefly.
[01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:53.807]  Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America.
[01:28:54.167 --> 01:28:57.590]  Not more advantages for people at the very top.
[01:28:58.769 --> 01:29:17.397]  Mr. Trump, typical politician, all talk, no action, sounds good, doesn't work, never going to happen, our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.
[01:29:17.437 --> 01:29:23.120]  Now look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:23.901]  No, we never got out of it.
[01:29:23.921 --> 01:29:26.002]  And believe me, we're in a bubble right now.
[01:29:26.422 --> 01:29:28.824]  And the only thing that looks good is the stock market.
[01:29:29.104 --> 01:29:32.527]  But if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.
[01:29:32.967 --> 01:29:35.669]  We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.
[01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:37.651]  And we better be awfully careful.
[01:29:37.771 --> 01:29:40.653]  And we have a Fed that's doing political things.
[01:29:40.933 --> 01:29:42.835]  This Janet Yellen of the Fed.
[01:29:42.875 --> 01:29:44.116]  Now he's going after the Fed!
[01:29:44.136 --> 01:29:44.636]  Oh, he's so good!
[01:29:44.676 --> 01:29:45.417]  So glad I bet on him!
[01:29:48.499 --> 01:29:57.931]  The day Obama leaves and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen.
[01:29:57.971 --> 01:29:59.673]  Because the Fed is not doing their job.
[01:29:59.933 --> 01:30:04.098]  The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.
[01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:08.922]  She won't release her foundation stuff.
[01:30:08.982 --> 01:30:09.722]  Why should he?
[01:30:09.742 --> 01:30:13.704]  David will pop in there and yell right at the moment and then we'll go back to him.
[01:30:25.330 --> 01:30:26.431]  I don't mind releasing.
[01:30:26.511 --> 01:30:31.293]  I'm under a routine audit, and it'll be released, and as soon as the audit's finished, it'll be released.
[01:30:31.673 --> 01:30:43.759]  But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page, essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:45.320]  It shows income.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:51.243]  In fact, the income, I just looked today, the income is filed at $694 million for this past year.
[01:30:51.263 --> 01:30:51.563]  $694 million.
[01:30:55.185 --> 01:30:58.629]  If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.
[01:30:58.889 --> 01:31:01.132]  But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.
[01:31:01.472 --> 01:31:11.943]  When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs.
[01:31:12.023 --> 01:31:16.108]  Because everybody... Lester, we have a trade deficit.
[01:31:16.348 --> 01:31:21.473]  Hillary represents the Chinese President in Wikileaks.
[01:31:21.974 --> 01:31:22.474]  Arrest her.
[01:31:22.895 --> 01:31:24.897]  She has secret bank accounts everywhere.
[01:31:24.937 --> 01:31:25.738]  They admit it.
[01:31:26.298 --> 01:31:30.382]  We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.
[01:31:30.402 --> 01:31:32.685]  The IRS has an audit of your taxes.
[01:31:33.125 --> 01:31:36.188]  You're perfectly free to release your taxes.
[01:31:36.909 --> 01:31:46.699]  The question is, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal... Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit... Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:50.003]  I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.
[01:31:50.023 --> 01:31:50.884]  I said, do you get audited?
[01:31:50.904 --> 01:31:52.726]  I get audited almost every year.
[01:31:53.266 --> 01:31:54.888]  And in a way, I should be complaining.
[01:31:54.948 --> 01:31:55.929]  I'm not even complaining.
[01:31:55.989 --> 01:31:56.530]  I don't mind it.
[01:31:56.730 --> 01:31:59.193]  Just say Hillary won't release her foundation crap.
[01:31:59.733 --> 01:32:00.494]  But other people don't.
[01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:02.096]  David, isn't this a red herring pop-in here?
[01:32:02.136 --> 01:32:02.936]  David Knight.
[01:32:03.117 --> 01:32:03.797]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:32:03.817 --> 01:32:06.280]  You know, he's got such a complicated tax situation.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:11.365]  What they want to do is dig into this and raise, you know, muddy the water.
[01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:11.966]  Look at this.
[01:32:11.986 --> 01:32:13.207]  Look at this deduction here.
[01:32:13.347 --> 01:32:21.996]  And, of course, Hillary has had people like Mr. Comey, FBI director, and Loretta Lynch, their law firm, were the ones who did her taxes in the past.
[01:32:22.316 --> 01:32:26.257]  And they would do taxes on politicians to make sure that they've got a large amount of money.
[01:32:26.277 --> 01:32:32.399]  Mainline News admits she has the most mafia taxes ever, with secret bank accounts that won't even list the money.
[01:32:32.819 --> 01:32:33.139]  That's right.
[01:32:33.319 --> 01:32:34.640]  And she doesn't know I list the donors.
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:37.841]  I'm going to come back to you, but you've got live analysis, but let's go back to this.
[01:32:38.201 --> 01:32:41.142]  But I would go against them if she releases her email.
[01:32:41.162 --> 01:32:41.862]  So it's negotiable?
[01:32:43.288 --> 01:32:44.168]  It's not negotiable.
[01:32:44.208 --> 01:32:45.509]  No, let her release the email.
[01:32:45.549 --> 01:32:46.689]  That's not fair!
[01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:49.011]  She won't release it, but he's supposed to!
[01:32:55.410 --> 01:32:58.771]  Well, I think you've just seen another example of bait-and-switch here.
[01:32:59.771 --> 01:33:04.912]  No, you won't release anything, and you've got secret accounts all over the world, lady, and the media won't make an issue.
[01:33:04.932 --> 01:33:08.573]  You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns.
[01:33:08.593 --> 01:33:13.335]  But Donald Trump, that never gets any tax money, has to bow down to a pig like you!
[01:33:13.475 --> 01:33:16.575]  That's the key thing, Alex, they want to say.
[01:33:16.615 --> 01:33:17.236]  Staying her down.
[01:33:17.256 --> 01:33:17.936]  Staying her down.
[01:33:18.076 --> 01:33:18.896]  This is our analysis.
[01:33:18.956 --> 01:33:20.116]  If folks don't like it, it's fine.
[01:33:20.316 --> 01:33:20.957]  Go to another feed.
[01:33:20.997 --> 01:33:21.817]  We're here giving analysis.
[01:33:21.837 --> 01:33:22.277]  Go ahead, David.
[01:33:22.777 --> 01:33:25.458]  They want to say, look, he paid a very low percentage.
[01:33:25.518 --> 01:33:26.698]  I paid a very high percentage.
[01:33:26.718 --> 01:33:34.301]  But as you pointed out, she's laundering her money through the Clinton Foundation and other things which she does not want to have audited, which she does not want to make transparent.
[01:33:34.581 --> 01:33:38.602]  So she continues to try to hammer him and say, you're not being transparent with your tax returns.
[01:33:38.882 --> 01:33:41.023]  She simply wants to muddy the water.
[01:33:41.403 --> 01:33:43.583]  If there's a criminal issue, they would come after him.
[01:33:43.923 --> 01:33:46.444]  But what she also wants to do is to demagogue this thing.
[01:33:46.464 --> 01:33:50.105]  It's just like he said, I'll release my medical records when she will, and she never will, so he released his.
[01:33:50.345 --> 01:33:51.086]  Great point, David.
[01:33:51.346 --> 01:33:52.286]  Lala, let's go back to Hillary.
[01:33:52.506 --> 01:34:05.534]  federal taxes because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.
[01:34:05.894 --> 01:34:06.455]  Good for him.
[01:34:06.635 --> 01:34:14.179]  If he's paid zero, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.
[01:34:14.199 --> 01:34:16.001]  Tax avoidance is legal and it's smart.
[01:34:16.021 --> 01:34:19.423]  I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about
[01:34:20.203 --> 01:34:29.065]  Having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.
[01:34:29.665 --> 01:34:34.386]  And the financial disclosure statement, they don't give you the tax rate, they don't give you all the details.
[01:34:34.406 --> 01:34:39.867]  Alex, the friends of the Obamas and the Clintons, like General Electric, they don't pay any taxes, but that's not a problem.
[01:34:39.927 --> 01:34:45.028]  It's only a problem when their opponents don't pay taxes because they did tax avoidance.
[01:34:45.068 --> 01:34:48.269]  They use the same loopholes the elite use, and they're pissed.
[01:34:48.589 --> 01:34:48.969]  Exactly.
[01:34:49.269 --> 01:34:50.869]  And he wants to change it and help us.
[01:34:50.949 --> 01:34:51.370]  Absolutely.
[01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:52.030]  Let's go back to Hillary.
[01:34:52.450 --> 01:34:54.930]  We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.
[01:34:55.791 --> 01:35:02.792]  But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?
[01:35:03.172 --> 01:35:04.893]  Who does he owe money to?
[01:35:05.653 --> 01:35:09.774]  Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.
[01:35:09.934 --> 01:35:12.435]  He also raised the issue of your emails.
[01:35:12.455 --> 01:35:13.355]  Do you want to respond to that?
[01:35:13.795 --> 01:35:14.095]  I do.
[01:35:14.295 --> 01:35:18.098]  You know, I made a mistake using a private email.
[01:35:18.298 --> 01:35:18.979]  That's for sure.
[01:35:19.299 --> 01:35:23.041]  And if I had to do it over again, I would obviously do it differently.
[01:35:24.062 --> 01:35:25.883]  But I'm not going to make any excuses.
[01:35:26.083 --> 01:35:28.625]  It was a mistake and I take responsibility for that.
[01:35:29.306 --> 01:35:29.686]  Mr. Trump?
[01:35:31.735 --> 01:35:32.816]  That was more than a mistake.
[01:35:33.496 --> 01:35:34.897]  That was done purposely.
[01:35:35.077 --> 01:35:36.057]  Okay, that was not a mistake.
[01:35:36.077 --> 01:35:37.118]  That was done purposely.
[01:35:37.638 --> 01:35:44.742]  When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth, so they're not prosecuted.
[01:35:45.202 --> 01:35:48.644]  When you have the man that set up the illegal server, taking the Fifth,
[01:35:49.884 --> 01:35:50.945]  I think it's disgraceful.
[01:35:51.385 --> 01:35:56.090]  And believe me, this country really thinks it's disgraceful also.
[01:35:56.510 --> 01:36:01.115]  As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns, that I can tell you.
[01:36:01.375 --> 01:36:03.277]  You learn a lot from financial disclosure.
[01:36:03.757 --> 01:36:05.479]  And you should go down and take a look at that.
[01:36:05.979 --> 01:36:08.481]  The other thing, I'm extremely under-leveraged.
[01:36:09.321 --> 01:36:16.125]  The report that said $650, which by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business said, boy, that's really not a lot of money.
[01:36:16.145 --> 01:36:18.046]  It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.
[01:36:18.487 --> 01:36:21.729]  The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was
[01:36:22.589 --> 01:36:27.273]  Actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.
[01:36:28.053 --> 01:36:29.975]  And the $650 isn't even on that.
[01:36:30.255 --> 01:36:32.677]  But it's not $650, it's much less than that.
[01:36:33.117 --> 01:36:34.638]  But I could give you a list of banks.
[01:36:34.658 --> 01:36:37.080]  He just took her to the woodshed on emails.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:40.022]  These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.
[01:36:40.082 --> 01:36:41.163]  I could do that very quickly.
[01:36:41.664 --> 01:36:42.684]  I am very underleveraged.
[01:36:42.744 --> 01:36:43.725]  I have a great company.
[01:36:43.745 --> 01:36:45.166]  I have a tremendous income.
[01:36:45.586 --> 01:36:50.010]  And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocious way, it's because... You're a good manager.
[01:36:50.230 --> 01:36:55.796]  It's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.
[01:36:56.597 --> 01:36:59.120]  It's not some scumbag globalist selling us out.
[01:36:59.140 --> 01:36:59.360]  Yes!
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:00.501]  Our country's a mess.
[01:37:00.541 --> 01:37:00.742]  Yes!
[01:37:00.762 --> 01:37:06.568]  It's one thing to have 20 trillion in debt, and our roads are good, and our bridges are good, and everything's in great shape.
[01:37:06.648 --> 01:37:09.732]  Our airports are like from a third world country.
[01:37:09.752 --> 01:37:10.793]  Globalists want you poor.
[01:37:11.093 --> 01:37:12.295]  America wants you rich.
[01:37:12.315 --> 01:37:13.837]  We've been under globalism to screw us, folks.
[01:37:13.857 --> 01:37:14.378]  They admit it.
[01:37:14.398 --> 01:37:16.801]  She's an operative of these people.
[01:37:28.417 --> 01:37:31.478]  We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess!
[01:37:31.699 --> 01:37:32.779]  We haven't even started!
[01:37:33.339 --> 01:37:39.442]  And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.
[01:37:39.562 --> 01:37:42.323]  Whether it's six or five, but it looks like it's six.
[01:37:42.403 --> 01:37:43.584]  Six trillion dollars!
[01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:48.046]  In the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and it's really a shame.
[01:37:48.146 --> 01:37:50.987]  And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton
[01:37:51.607 --> 01:37:52.887]  That have caused this problem.
[01:37:53.087 --> 01:37:55.268]  Our country has tremendous problems.
[01:37:55.628 --> 01:37:56.569]  We're a debtor nation.
[01:37:56.589 --> 01:37:57.389]  She's an enemy operative.
[01:37:57.409 --> 01:37:58.489]  We're a serious debtor nation.
[01:37:58.929 --> 01:38:03.431]  And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.
[01:38:03.451 --> 01:38:08.372]  That needs to kick the globalist, cloward and piven people, the anti-prosperity people, out!
[01:38:08.532 --> 01:38:09.853]  On so many of your ideas.
[01:38:10.293 --> 01:38:14.414]  And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.
[01:38:14.634 --> 01:38:18.036]  And you put yours through a foundation and steal money from Haitians.
[01:38:18.076 --> 01:38:19.437]  He needs to attack her more.
[01:38:19.777 --> 01:38:21.138]  Go after her or steal a little kid's money.
[01:38:21.158 --> 01:38:26.842]  If your main claim to be President of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.
[01:38:26.862 --> 01:38:28.883]  Trump may be nice to you, I won't be which.
[01:38:28.983 --> 01:38:30.524]  I am dark hearted as you called me.
[01:38:31.205 --> 01:38:34.607]  You built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.
[01:38:35.387 --> 01:38:41.331]  And indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.
[01:38:41.771 --> 01:38:42.172]  I've met
[01:38:43.066 --> 01:38:59.736]  Dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.
[01:39:00.036 --> 01:39:05.079]  We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.
[01:39:05.099 --> 01:39:05.660]  That's a big point.
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:08.301]  He demanded more money and Trump wouldn't do it.
[01:39:08.401 --> 01:39:10.362]  We need to show how she screws little guys right now.
[01:39:11.533 --> 01:39:16.960]  And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you.
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:22.107]  Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work, which our country should do too.
[01:39:22.127 --> 01:39:26.413]  Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business
[01:39:27.174 --> 01:39:38.302]  Not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them.
[01:39:38.422 --> 01:39:42.985]  I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.
[01:39:43.065 --> 01:39:45.827]  Yeah, architects never screw anybody, Hillary.
[01:39:45.927 --> 01:39:51.350]  But the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.
[01:39:52.131 --> 01:39:54.793]  And when we talk about your business,
[01:39:55.393 --> 01:39:58.675]  You've taken business bankruptcy six times.
[01:39:59.635 --> 01:40:02.597]  Trump's doing good, but he needs to go after her more.
[01:40:02.657 --> 01:40:05.098]  I give him a B-plus right now.
[01:40:05.118 --> 01:40:06.279]  He's being too nice.
[01:40:06.299 --> 01:40:06.999]  They told him to be nice.
[01:40:07.119 --> 01:40:07.479]  No.
[01:40:07.559 --> 01:40:08.260]  It's a gargoyle.
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:08.860]  It's a liar.
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:11.001]  He's had hundreds of companies.
[01:40:11.041 --> 01:40:11.561]  I have hundreds.
[01:40:11.581 --> 01:40:12.662]  That's what they... You shut them down.
[01:40:12.702 --> 01:40:13.742]  You don't do one company.
[01:40:13.863 --> 01:40:15.043]  Every film's a new company.
[01:40:21.326 --> 01:40:24.669]  Every new website's a new company.
[01:40:24.729 --> 01:40:29.552]  He's had over a thousand companies and declared bankruptcy six times on sub-companies.
[01:40:29.812 --> 01:40:32.814]  He's not declared individual bankruptcy.
[01:40:33.034 --> 01:40:33.835]  It's all words.
[01:40:34.075 --> 01:40:35.076]  It's all lies.
[01:40:35.416 --> 01:40:44.602]  I built an unbelievable company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.
[01:40:44.622 --> 01:40:45.382]  And you're a winner.
[01:40:45.582 --> 01:40:46.783]  Half your business is succeeding.
[01:40:48.184 --> 01:40:53.849]  On occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.
[01:40:54.649 --> 01:41:05.338]  And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taking advantage of the laws of the nation.
[01:41:05.358 --> 01:41:08.520]  Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.
[01:41:08.941 --> 01:41:11.663]  But I take advantage of the laws of the nation.
[01:41:12.063 --> 01:41:19.650]  Because I'm running a company, my obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.
[01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:20.931]  And that's what I do.
[01:41:21.511 --> 01:41:28.537]  But what she doesn't say is the tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.
[01:41:28.878 --> 01:41:29.778]  I'll give you an example.
[01:41:30.319 --> 01:41:34.803]  We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue, right next to the White House.
[01:41:35.563 --> 01:41:39.567]  So if I don't get there one way, I'm gonna get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.
[01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.850]  42 minutes in, folks.
[01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:43.172]  We're opening the old post office.
[01:41:43.872 --> 01:41:44.573]  Under budget.
[01:41:45.153 --> 01:41:46.154]  Ahead of schedule.
[01:41:46.694 --> 01:41:47.955]  Saved tremendous money.
[01:41:47.975 --> 01:41:49.496]  I'm a year ahead of schedule.
[01:41:49.516 --> 01:41:50.516]  Trump's known for that, by the way.
[01:41:50.536 --> 01:41:52.637]  And that's what this country should be doing.
[01:41:52.938 --> 01:41:56.660]  We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:42:02.283]  We buy products for our military and they come at a cost that are so far above what they're supposed to be.
[01:42:02.303 --> 01:42:03.244]  Three billion dollar fighter jets.
[01:42:03.504 --> 01:42:05.005]  We don't have people who know what they're doing.
[01:42:05.025 --> 01:42:05.846]  The Russians built one better for 10 mil.
[01:42:05.866 --> 01:42:06.827]  We look at the budget.
[01:42:07.187 --> 01:42:09.088]  The budget is bad to a large extent.
[01:42:09.108 --> 01:42:09.328]  Really?
[01:42:09.368 --> 01:42:10.549]  We can't be better than the Russians?
[01:42:10.569 --> 01:42:14.492]  We have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.
[01:42:15.433 --> 01:42:20.256]  The Trump administration is way ahead of budget and way ahead of schedule.
[01:42:20.657 --> 01:42:23.399]  And we should be able to do that for our country.
[01:42:23.419 --> 01:42:26.381]  Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment.
[01:42:26.401 --> 01:42:27.241]  God, please give us Trump.
[01:42:27.261 --> 01:42:27.442]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:27.462 --> 01:42:31.204]  We move to our next segment talking about America's direction, and let's start by talking about race.
[01:42:32.225 --> 01:42:33.286]  Go after her on Soros!
[01:42:33.306 --> 01:42:33.626]  Trump, attack!
[01:42:33.646 --> 01:42:33.966]  Attack!
[01:42:33.986 --> 01:42:36.348]  She is the author of all this race baiting on Soros!
[01:42:36.368 --> 01:42:37.668]  Right there is the problem!
[01:42:37.708 --> 01:42:38.269]  Right there!
[01:42:38.289 --> 01:42:39.329]  Well, you're right.
[01:42:56.758 --> 01:43:01.880]  Race remains a significant... She's stoking as much as she can.
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:03.561]  This is InfoWars.com live coverage, back to Hillary.
[01:43:03.581 --> 01:43:05.202]  Unfortunately, race still determines too much.
[01:43:05.822 --> 01:43:16.367]  Often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.
[01:43:17.328 --> 01:43:21.650]  We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.
[01:43:21.670 --> 01:43:22.710]  Where the cop got indicted.
[01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:25.772]  And we've got to do several things at the same time.
[01:43:26.826 --> 01:43:35.129]  We have to restore trust between communities and the police.
[01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:47.774]  We have to work to make sure that police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.
[01:43:49.324 --> 01:43:55.689]  Everyone should be respected by the law and everyone should respect the law.
[01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:59.432]  Right now that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.
[01:44:00.032 --> 01:44:04.936]  So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.
[01:44:05.697 --> 01:44:12.962]  I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.
[01:44:13.854 --> 01:44:24.165]  But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.
[01:44:24.525 --> 01:44:30.471]  So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.
[01:44:31.312 --> 01:44:35.635]  And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.
[01:44:36.335 --> 01:44:44.580]  The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together.
[01:44:45.441 --> 01:44:47.542]  So we have to do two things, as I said.
[01:44:47.782 --> 01:44:49.083]  We have to restore trust.
[01:44:49.163 --> 01:44:50.483]  We have to work with the police.
[01:44:50.623 --> 01:44:54.245]  We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.
[01:44:54.705 --> 01:45:01.648]  And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.
[01:45:01.868 --> 01:45:02.868]  Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.
[01:45:02.908 --> 01:45:04.009]  How do you heal the divide?
[01:45:04.029 --> 01:45:11.672]  Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.
[01:45:12.532 --> 01:45:13.352]  We need law and order.
[01:45:13.912 --> 01:45:14.633]  If we don't have it,
[01:45:15.615 --> 01:45:16.576]  We're not going to have a country.
[01:45:17.256 --> 01:45:28.902]  And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's... I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long.
[01:45:29.563 --> 01:45:31.044]  We need law and order.
[01:45:31.784 --> 01:45:32.365]  In our country.
[01:45:33.005 --> 01:45:38.709]  And I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police.
[01:45:38.889 --> 01:45:40.130]  We just came in.
[01:45:40.851 --> 01:45:44.674]  We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group.
[01:45:44.914 --> 01:45:47.996]  Very, I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.
[01:45:48.977 --> 01:45:57.803]  We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell.
[01:45:58.686 --> 01:46:00.147]  Because it's so dangerous.
[01:46:00.887 --> 01:46:02.647]  You walk down the street, you get shot.
[01:46:03.228 --> 01:46:06.909]  In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings.
[01:46:07.169 --> 01:46:07.809]  Thousands!
[01:46:08.409 --> 01:46:10.470]  Since January 1st.
[01:46:11.110 --> 01:46:12.151]  Thousands of shootings.
[01:46:13.051 --> 01:46:14.071]  And I'm saying, where is this?
[01:46:14.251 --> 01:46:15.872]  Is this a war-torn country?
[01:46:15.952 --> 01:46:16.612]  What are we doing?
[01:46:17.333 --> 01:46:19.073]  And we have to stop the violence.
[01:46:19.333 --> 01:46:21.254]  We have to bring back law and order.
[01:46:21.834 --> 01:46:25.315]  In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed.
[01:46:25.335 --> 01:46:25.856]  Thousands!
[01:46:26.116 --> 01:46:26.936]  Over the last...
[01:46:27.076 --> 01:46:27.736]  This won't roll in.
[01:46:27.756 --> 01:46:32.339]  In fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president.
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:36.802]  Over four, almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.
[01:46:36.942 --> 01:46:38.744]  And most of the last two years, it's getting worse.
[01:46:38.844 --> 01:46:39.404]  Law and order.
[01:46:39.904 --> 01:46:44.708]  Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago, you do stop and frisk, which worked very well.
[01:46:44.748 --> 01:46:45.768]  Mayor Giuliani is here.
[01:46:45.788 --> 01:46:47.029]  It worked very well in New York.
[01:46:47.449 --> 01:46:49.070]  It brought the crime rate way down.
[01:46:49.651 --> 01:46:53.173]  But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.
[01:46:53.513 --> 01:46:55.695]  We have gangs roaming the street.
[01:46:56.215 --> 01:46:58.397]  And in many cases, they're illegally here.
[01:46:58.417 --> 01:46:58.877]  Illegal immigrants.
[01:46:58.917 --> 01:47:01.019]  Yeah, target the criminals in high crime areas.
[01:47:01.039 --> 01:47:02.521]  Don't target the criminal citizens.
[01:47:02.541 --> 01:47:03.622]  We have to be very strong.
[01:47:03.822 --> 01:47:05.503]  And we have to be very vigilant.
[01:47:05.803 --> 01:47:07.965]  We have to know what we're doing.
[01:47:08.466 --> 01:47:12.509]  Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.
[01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:16.433]  We have to protect our inner cities because African Americans...
[01:47:16.733 --> 01:47:20.695]  See, it's like Trump finishes my sentences because it's the truth.
[01:47:20.715 --> 01:47:23.577]  You're two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up.
[01:47:23.877 --> 01:47:26.819]  Stomping Frist was ruled unconstitutional in New York.
[01:47:26.859 --> 01:47:28.040]  Not like a police state either.
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:31.402]  Largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.
[01:47:31.582 --> 01:47:32.122]  No, you're wrong.
[01:47:33.043 --> 01:47:33.884]  It went before.
[01:47:34.884 --> 01:47:45.507]  A judge, who was a very against police judge, it was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.
[01:47:45.787 --> 01:47:46.627]  They would have won an appeal.
[01:47:46.807 --> 01:47:50.188]  If you look at it, throughout the country there are many places where it's allowed.
[01:47:50.208 --> 01:47:52.609]  The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.
[01:47:52.729 --> 01:47:58.311]  No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and that are bad people that shouldn't have them.
[01:47:59.091 --> 01:47:59.872]  These are felons.
[01:47:59.892 --> 01:48:11.379]  These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be... When you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago,
[01:48:12.250 --> 01:48:12.770]  By guns.
[01:48:13.331 --> 01:48:17.433]  From the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown.
[01:48:17.593 --> 01:48:19.314]  It's a discovery if felons have guns.
[01:48:19.334 --> 01:48:19.874]  Stop and frisk.
[01:48:20.214 --> 01:48:21.155]  You need more police.
[01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:26.078]  You need a better community, you know, of relations.
[01:48:26.198 --> 01:48:29.419]  Still, I don't support stop and frisk, but the larger plan is to implode the country.
[01:48:29.439 --> 01:48:29.700]  It's terrible.
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:30.880]  I have property there.
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:32.661]  It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.
[01:48:33.061 --> 01:48:37.064]  But when you look, and Chicago's not the only, you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.
[01:48:38.084 --> 01:48:39.746]  You need better relationships.
[01:48:39.846 --> 01:48:42.068]  I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.
[01:48:42.088 --> 01:48:48.294]  You need better relationships between the communities and the police because in some cases... Hillary's the one with mandatory sentencing to put blacks in prison.
[01:48:48.314 --> 01:48:48.895]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:48:48.915 --> 01:48:50.616]  The relationships were really studied.
[01:48:51.157 --> 01:48:54.380]  The relationships were really a beautiful thing.
[01:48:55.001 --> 01:48:57.743]  And then five police officers were killed.
[01:48:58.704 --> 01:49:00.045]  One night very violently.
[01:49:01.245 --> 01:49:04.707]  So there's some bad things going on, some really bad things.
[01:49:04.747 --> 01:49:07.248]  But we need, Lester, we need law and order.
[01:49:07.468 --> 01:49:10.409]  And we need law and order in the inner cities.
[01:49:10.889 --> 01:49:17.132]  Because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African American and Hispanic people.
[01:49:17.232 --> 01:49:22.494]  And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.
[01:49:25.889 --> 01:49:28.490]  I've heard Donald say this at his rallies.
[01:49:28.590 --> 01:49:29.690]  Trump is winning this debate.
[01:49:30.431 --> 01:49:39.453]  It's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire, negative picture of black communities in our country.
[01:49:39.473 --> 01:49:41.934]  She says it's the end of the world, the people are getting killed.
[01:49:42.154 --> 01:49:52.857]  The black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families... She's implying he's bashing black people but he wants to cut crime and help them.
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:50:01.806]  There's a lot that we should be proud of, but we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.
[01:50:02.426 --> 01:50:06.389]  There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.
[01:50:06.789 --> 01:50:13.814]  Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional, and in part because it was ineffective.
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:16.661]  It did not do what it needed to do.
[01:50:16.681 --> 01:50:19.122]  No, things aren't unconstitutional because they're ineffective.
[01:50:19.142 --> 01:50:21.043]  Because they're unconstitutional.
[01:50:21.063 --> 01:50:24.965]  Violent crime is one half of what it was in 1991.
[01:50:25.085 --> 01:50:26.645]  Property crime is down 40%.
[01:50:26.745 --> 01:50:28.586]  But I thought we got to take all the guns.
[01:50:28.666 --> 01:50:29.967]  It's an epidemic of crime.
[01:50:30.027 --> 01:50:30.467]  You're right.
[01:50:30.767 --> 01:50:33.168]  Hillary tells the truth, the headline.
[01:50:33.388 --> 01:50:34.649]  Crime is way down.
[01:50:34.969 --> 01:50:36.250]  They hype it all up.
[01:50:37.290 --> 01:50:41.974]  It's only down in cities run by Democrats where they've taken all the guns from law abiding!
[01:50:42.054 --> 01:50:44.076]  My God, Hillary just told the truth!
[01:50:44.436 --> 01:50:46.838]  It's like finding a unicorn!
[01:50:46.858 --> 01:50:47.979]  That's big, get that clip.
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:50.301]  Hillary just told the truth and admits crime's way down.
[01:50:50.321 --> 01:50:50.502]  60% since 92.
[01:50:50.582 --> 01:50:51.242]  Except in areas she runs.
[01:50:51.262 --> 01:50:52.804]  She shipped the crack cocaine to the black neighborhoods.
[01:51:01.391 --> 01:51:05.934]  We've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.
[01:51:11.161 --> 01:51:18.927]  We have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system.
[01:51:19.147 --> 01:51:24.791]  Deal with mandatory minimum sentences which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.
[01:51:25.352 --> 01:51:27.874]  We need to have more second chance programs.
[01:51:28.294 --> 01:51:32.277]  I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system.
[01:51:32.357 --> 01:51:34.159]  I want to see them ended in the state system.
[01:51:34.619 --> 01:51:39.661]  You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.
[01:51:40.101 --> 01:51:43.142]  So there are some positive ways we can work on this.
[01:51:43.622 --> 01:51:51.985]  And I believe strongly that common sense can't be measured by justice right now.
[01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:56.326]  And this is something Donald has supported along with the gun lobby.
[01:51:56.386 --> 01:52:01.548]  Right now, we've got too many military-style weapons on the streets in a lot of places
[01:52:02.088 --> 01:52:03.589]  Which commit 4% of the crime.
[01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:06.211]  We need comprehensive background checks.
[01:52:06.651 --> 01:52:07.112]  We have them!
[01:52:07.132 --> 01:52:11.855]  We need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.
[01:52:12.316 --> 01:52:20.281]  And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.
[01:52:20.301 --> 01:52:20.782]  Extrajudicial.
[01:52:20.842 --> 01:52:23.204]  If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.
[01:52:23.244 --> 01:52:24.104]  Outside of due process, take your guns.
[01:52:24.124 --> 01:52:24.985]  That's the big one.
[01:52:25.005 --> 01:52:29.808]  She wants to be able to put you on a secret list when you have no convictions and take your guns.
[01:52:29.989 --> 01:52:30.389]  Huge!
[01:52:30.589 --> 01:52:34.431]  It's impossible to improve policing to go right at implicit bias.
[01:52:34.911 --> 01:52:37.913]  Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?
[01:52:38.453 --> 01:52:42.195]  Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.
[01:52:42.235 --> 01:52:44.596]  George Soros branding Black Lives Matter has made that worse.
[01:52:44.616 --> 01:52:45.717]  Yeah, I think they are, maybe.
[01:52:45.737 --> 01:52:47.177]  Because they've made it that way.
[01:52:47.197 --> 01:52:49.078]  The Democrats, the KKK leader, like her.
[01:52:49.098 --> 01:52:50.639]  Robert Burr, God.
[01:52:51.459 --> 01:52:55.962]  And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about
[01:52:57.168 --> 01:52:59.969]  You know, why am I feeling this way?
[01:53:00.649 --> 01:53:16.755]  But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said in my first budget we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.
[01:53:16.795 --> 01:53:21.457]  I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.
[01:53:22.117 --> 01:53:23.297]  They admit it's an issue.
[01:53:23.337 --> 01:53:24.638]  They've got a lot of concerns.
[01:53:25.018 --> 01:53:32.382]  Mental health is one of the biggest concerns because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.
[01:53:32.863 --> 01:53:34.203]  They want support.
[01:53:34.303 --> 01:53:35.584]  They want more training.
[01:53:35.644 --> 01:53:36.965]  They want more assistance.
[01:53:37.425 --> 01:53:42.248]  And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.
[01:53:43.368 --> 01:53:44.169]  I'd like to respond.
[01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.469]  Please.
[01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:53.457]  First of all, I agree, and a lot of people, even within my own party, want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no-fly lists.
[01:53:53.998 --> 01:53:54.558]  I agree with you.
[01:53:54.578 --> 01:54:01.064]  When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.
[01:54:01.104 --> 01:54:04.347]  These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.
[01:54:05.287 --> 01:54:08.830]  I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.
[01:54:09.150 --> 01:54:11.972]  And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them.
[01:54:12.012 --> 01:54:12.832]  We'll help them legally.
[01:54:12.852 --> 01:54:13.653]  We'll help them get off.
[01:54:14.333 --> 01:54:17.355]  But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.
[01:54:17.736 --> 01:54:22.159]  I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the word super predator
[01:54:22.759 --> 01:54:24.241]  About young black youth.
[01:54:25.082 --> 01:54:29.627]  And that's a term that I think was a, it's been horribly met, as you know.
[01:54:29.667 --> 01:54:31.069]  I think you've apologized for it.
[01:54:31.649 --> 01:54:33.832]  But I think it was a terrible thing to say.
[01:54:34.513 --> 01:54:39.098]  And when it comes to stop and frisk, you know, you're talking about taking guns away.
[01:54:39.298 --> 01:54:42.482]  Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.
[01:54:43.182 --> 01:54:46.886]  And I don't think, I really don't think you disagree with me on this if you want to know the truth.
[01:54:46.946 --> 01:54:50.990]  I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe.
[01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:59.379]  In New York City, stop and frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop and frisk brought it down to 500 murders.
[01:54:59.399 --> 01:55:01.140]  500 murders is a lot of murders.
[01:55:01.821 --> 01:55:03.883]  Hard to believe 500 is like supposed to be good.
[01:55:04.804 --> 01:55:12.829]  But we went from 2,200 to 500, and it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg, and it was terminated by our current mayor.
[01:55:13.149 --> 01:55:17.491]  But stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.
[01:55:17.551 --> 01:55:18.972]  Tremendous, beyond belief.
[01:55:19.493 --> 01:55:21.894]  So when you say it has no impact, it really did.
[01:55:21.934 --> 01:55:23.495]  It had a very, very big impact.
[01:55:23.595 --> 01:55:31.421]  Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.
[01:55:31.801 --> 01:55:32.902]  So there is... You're wrong.
[01:55:33.062 --> 01:55:33.483]  You're wrong.
[01:55:33.623 --> 01:55:34.183]  No, I'm not.
[01:55:34.203 --> 01:55:36.425]  Murders are up.
[01:55:36.625 --> 01:55:38.747]  New York has done an excellent job.
[01:55:38.787 --> 01:55:39.567]  And I give credit.
[01:55:39.707 --> 01:55:47.133]  I give credit across the board, going back, to mayors, to police chiefs, because it has worked.
[01:55:47.293 --> 01:55:52.938]  And other communities need to come together to do what will work as well.
[01:55:53.778 --> 01:55:54.900]  One murder is too many.
[01:55:55.580 --> 01:56:07.133]  But it is important that we learn about what has been effective and not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.
[01:56:08.154 --> 01:56:10.357]  Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?
[01:56:10.857 --> 01:56:12.459]  But let's also add
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:21.007]  No one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.
[01:56:21.527 --> 01:56:32.556]  And so we need to do a better job of working again with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police, to try to deal with this problem.
[01:56:32.576 --> 01:56:37.080]  This conversation is about race, and so Mr. Trump, I have to ask you... But I'd like to just respond, if I might.
[01:56:37.441 --> 01:56:38.281]  Please, 20 seconds.
[01:56:38.301 --> 01:56:39.082]  I'd just like to respond.
[01:56:39.102 --> 01:56:40.903]  Please respond, then I've got to call off the race.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:45.421]  The African American community has been let down by our politicians.
[01:56:46.101 --> 01:56:48.582]  They talk good around election time, like right now.
[01:56:49.002 --> 01:56:52.483]  And after the election, they said, see you later, I'll see you in four years.
[01:56:53.144 --> 01:57:00.706]  The African American community, look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.
[01:57:01.406 --> 01:57:07.628]  They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians because that's what it is.
[01:57:07.668 --> 01:57:10.668]  They've controlled these communities for up to a hundred years.
[01:57:10.768 --> 01:57:11.289]  Mr. Trump.
[01:57:11.469 --> 01:57:12.369]  Unbroken.
[01:57:12.829 --> 01:57:19.231]  And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities, and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just, you know, you've seen me.
[01:57:19.271 --> 01:57:20.311]  I've been all over the place.
[01:57:21.891 --> 01:57:23.852]  You decided to stay home, and that's okay.
[01:57:24.412 --> 01:57:30.796]  But I will tell you, I've been all over and I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.
[01:57:31.196 --> 01:57:37.099]  And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:43.783]  I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.
[01:57:45.144 --> 01:57:45.884]  And yes, I did.
[01:57:47.165 --> 01:57:48.546]  And you know what else I prepared for?
[01:57:48.566 --> 01:57:50.247]  I prepared to be president.
[01:57:50.587 --> 01:57:51.708]  And I think that's a good thing.
[01:57:53.723 --> 01:58:00.705]  Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen.
[01:58:00.745 --> 01:58:02.365]  You questioned his legitimacy.
[01:58:02.405 --> 01:58:08.927]  In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years, the president was born in the United States.
[01:58:08.947 --> 01:58:10.588]  Can you tell us what took you so long?
[01:58:10.648 --> 01:58:13.528]  I'll tell you very, well, just very simple to say.
[01:58:14.889 --> 01:58:15.729]  Sidney Blumenthal
[01:58:16.775 --> 01:58:21.379]  She works for the campaign, and very close friend of Secretary Clinton.
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:33.390]  And her campaign manager, Patty Doyle, went to, during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.
[01:58:33.951 --> 01:58:39.015]  And you can go look it up, and you can check it out, and if you look at CNN this past week,
[01:58:39.756 --> 01:58:45.158]  Patty Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.
[01:58:45.999 --> 01:58:53.122]  Lumethal sent McClatchy, a highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.
[01:58:53.462 --> 01:58:54.783]  They were pressing it very hard.
[01:58:55.423 --> 01:58:57.924]  She failed to get the birth certificate.
[01:58:57.944 --> 01:59:00.385]  When I got involved, I didn't fail.
[01:59:01.045 --> 01:59:01.926]  I got him to give
[01:59:03.046 --> 01:59:03.886]  The birth certificate.
[01:59:03.926 --> 01:59:06.728]  So I'm satisfied with it and I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.
[01:59:07.128 --> 01:59:09.649]  Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS.
[01:59:10.029 --> 01:59:12.150]  Because I want to get on to creating jobs.
[01:59:12.570 --> 01:59:14.971]  Because I want to get on to having a strong border.
[01:59:15.491 --> 01:59:20.293]  Because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.
[01:59:20.654 --> 01:59:23.395]  I'll let you respond, it's important, but I just want to get the answer here.
[01:59:24.215 --> 01:59:25.476]  The birth certificate was produced in 2011.
[01:59:26.396 --> 01:59:34.201]  You continued to tell the story and question the President's legitimacy in 2012, 13, 14, 15, as recently as January.
[01:59:34.221 --> 01:59:36.582]  So the question is, what changed your mind?
[01:59:36.602 --> 01:59:37.603]  Well, nobody was pressing it.
[01:59:37.723 --> 01:59:39.664]  Nobody was caring much about it.
[01:59:40.125 --> 01:59:42.086]  I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.
[01:59:42.486 --> 01:59:44.047]  But nobody was caring much about it.
[01:59:44.607 --> 01:59:50.571]  But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.
[01:59:51.739 --> 01:59:54.060]  Secretary Clinton also fought it.
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:57.061]  I mean, you know, now everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.
[01:59:57.261 --> 01:59:57.881]  Look, it's true.
[01:59:58.121 --> 02:00:00.502]  Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter.
[02:00:01.642 --> 02:00:09.105]  You just have to take a look at CNN the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager, and she was involved.
[02:00:09.966 --> 02:00:13.449]  But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.
[02:00:13.849 --> 02:00:14.830]  I'm sorry, I'm just going to follow that.
[02:00:14.850 --> 02:00:16.991]  I will let you respond to that because there's a lot there.
[02:00:17.051 --> 02:00:19.433]  But we're talking about racial healing in this segment.
[02:00:20.113 --> 02:00:21.394]  What do you say to Americans?
[02:00:21.414 --> 02:00:23.075]  Well, it was very... I say nothing.
[02:00:23.135 --> 02:00:25.397]  I say nothing because I was able to get him to produce it.
[02:00:25.437 --> 02:00:27.038]  He should have produced it a long time before.
[02:00:27.318 --> 02:00:27.879]  I say nothing.
[02:00:27.919 --> 02:00:30.140]  But let me just tell you, when you talk about healing...
[02:00:31.221 --> 02:00:39.383]  I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.
[02:00:39.403 --> 02:00:40.363]  I think you can see that.
[02:00:41.084 --> 02:00:45.665]  And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.
[02:00:45.965 --> 02:00:53.767]  And I think I did a great job and a great service, not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his presidency.
[02:00:53.807 --> 02:00:54.367]  Secretary Clinton.
[02:00:55.747 --> 02:00:57.768]  Well, by the way, Trump heard.
[02:00:59.249 --> 02:01:01.793]  He is dominating, but he's still being too nice.
[02:01:01.853 --> 02:01:04.938]  They started three minutes late, so we've got 30 minutes left right now.
[02:01:04.978 --> 02:01:05.899]  This is his story.
[02:01:05.919 --> 02:01:06.921]  She started it, by the way.
[02:01:14.770 --> 02:01:16.832]  But it can't be dismissed that easily.
[02:01:17.473 --> 02:01:25.581]  Racist to say he said he was born in Kenya, that was a cover for Frank Marshall Davis, he was born in Hawaii.
[02:01:25.681 --> 02:01:28.324]  He said in the Harvard Review he was born there three years in a row.
[02:01:28.344 --> 02:01:30.166]  He was not an American citizen.
[02:01:31.072 --> 02:01:36.114]  I mean, they put out a fake birth certificate to fool us from his dad, Frank Marshall Davis.
[02:01:36.254 --> 02:01:39.795]  I'm sorry, I've been quiet for 10 minutes, but let's just go back to the live coverage.
[02:01:39.875 --> 02:01:41.855]  Everybody else has got live coverage uninterrupted.
[02:01:41.875 --> 02:01:45.696]  This is analysis, fact-checking live if you want to see it, InfoWars.com.
[02:01:45.736 --> 02:01:48.957]  Let's be clear, a lot of new viewers tuning in saying, why is this guy talking over himself?
[02:01:49.057 --> 02:01:49.798]  That's what we do.
[02:01:49.998 --> 02:01:50.598]  Fair use.
[02:01:50.618 --> 02:01:52.298]  We're covering it with political analysis.
[02:01:52.318 --> 02:01:52.879]  Free speech.
[02:01:52.899 --> 02:01:53.239]  Here it is.
[02:01:54.139 --> 02:01:57.340]  ...being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination.
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:01:58.400]  Which you run!
[02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:00.401]  Which lets you commit crimes!
[02:02:00.521 --> 02:02:01.161]  I'm sorry!
[02:02:01.201 --> 02:02:09.144]  ...appointments in one of his developments to African Americans... Oh my God, oh my... When he got an award from Jesse Jackson for hiring African Americans 15 years ago.
[02:02:09.564 --> 02:02:12.245]  He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.
[02:02:12.265 --> 02:02:19.127]  Oh my God, he's got hundreds of businesses he got sued by the Justice Department, run by a criminal, bringing the UN in to run our country!
[02:02:19.207 --> 02:02:20.147]  ...racist behavior.
[02:02:20.167 --> 02:02:20.847]  Sorry, I said I'd shut up.
[02:02:21.207 --> 02:02:22.108]  And the birther lie...
[02:02:23.490 --> 02:02:24.911]  It was a very hurtful one.
[02:02:24.971 --> 02:02:28.454]  Barack Obama is a man of my dignity.
[02:02:30.256 --> 02:02:38.622]  And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.
[02:02:39.895 --> 02:02:44.559]  But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech.
[02:02:44.579 --> 02:02:47.541]  Look, she's played nice and friendly up front, now the knives are coming out.
[02:02:47.561 --> 02:02:49.723]  They go low, we go high.
[02:02:49.743 --> 02:02:55.468]  Go after her, Trump, on stealing the charity money from the Haitian children.
[02:02:56.889 --> 02:02:57.529]  Go after her.
[02:02:57.789 --> 02:02:58.870]  I would love to respond.
[02:02:58.890 --> 02:03:04.073]  First of all, I got to watch, in preparing for this, some of your debates against Barack Obama.
[02:03:04.093 --> 02:03:06.954]  You treated him with terrible disrespect.
[02:03:06.974 --> 02:03:07.334]  That's right.
[02:03:07.374 --> 02:03:12.097]  And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.
[02:03:12.137 --> 02:03:12.457]  Good.
[02:03:12.477 --> 02:03:13.418]  It doesn't work that way.
[02:03:13.878 --> 02:03:15.419]  You were after him.
[02:03:15.499 --> 02:03:16.279]  You were trying to.
[02:03:16.299 --> 02:03:20.641]  You even sent out, or your campaign sent out, pictures of him in a certain garb.
[02:03:21.022 --> 02:03:21.942]  Very famous pictures.
[02:03:21.982 --> 02:03:23.103]  I don't think you can deny that.
[02:03:23.823 --> 02:03:26.844]  But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.
[02:03:27.244 --> 02:03:31.706]  So when you try to act holier-than-thou, it really doesn't work.
[02:03:32.006 --> 02:03:32.646]  It really doesn't.
[02:03:32.686 --> 02:03:44.931]  Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, he had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country, it was a federal lawsuit, were sued.
[02:03:45.731 --> 02:03:49.753]  We settled the suit with zero, with no admission of guilt.
[02:03:50.638 --> 02:03:51.619]  It was very easy to do.
[02:03:51.639 --> 02:03:53.179]  That's right, you have a building manager.
[02:03:53.199 --> 02:03:53.920]  Somebody claims he's racist.
[02:03:53.940 --> 02:03:55.040]  I noticed you bring that up a lot.
[02:03:55.101 --> 02:03:55.821]  And then you get sued.
[02:03:55.861 --> 02:04:00.383]  I also noticed the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.
[02:04:00.844 --> 02:04:02.044]  Maybe I'm trying to save the money.
[02:04:02.485 --> 02:04:06.947]  But frankly, I look at that and I say, isn't that amazing?
[02:04:07.007 --> 02:04:11.550]  Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission.
[02:04:11.590 --> 02:04:13.411]  God has sent us him as a reprieve.
[02:04:13.531 --> 02:04:14.571]  We don't take him where he is.
[02:04:14.631 --> 02:04:15.532]  Real estate firms.
[02:04:16.192 --> 02:04:17.353]  And it's just one of those things.
[02:04:17.393 --> 02:04:18.734]  I'll go on one step further.
[02:04:19.534 --> 02:04:26.478]  In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world.
[02:04:27.378 --> 02:04:31.881]  I opened a club and really got great credit for it.
[02:04:32.561 --> 02:04:40.506]  No discrimination against African-Americans, against Muslims, against... 25 years ago and nobody did it.
[02:04:40.526 --> 02:04:41.927]  Those elite clubs don't want me out.
[02:04:41.947 --> 02:04:45.128]  ...a tremendously successful club, and I'm so glad I did it.
[02:04:47.136 --> 02:04:52.918]  I have been given great credit for what I did, and I'm very, very proud of it.
[02:04:52.938 --> 02:04:54.359]  That's the way I feel.
[02:04:54.759 --> 02:04:56.539]  That's the true way I feel.
[02:04:56.639 --> 02:04:58.920]  Our next segment is called Securing America.
[02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:03.342]  We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country.
[02:05:03.422 --> 02:05:07.643]  Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen.
[02:05:07.983 --> 02:05:11.204]  So my question is, who's behind it, and how do we fight it?
[02:05:14.639 --> 02:05:26.246]  Well I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.
[02:05:26.426 --> 02:05:37.033]  There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they then can use to make money.
[02:05:37.693 --> 02:05:42.116]  But increasingly we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states.
[02:05:42.916 --> 02:05:43.797]  Organs of states.
[02:05:44.237 --> 02:05:48.260]  The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.
[02:05:49.060 --> 02:05:58.426]  There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.
[02:05:58.546 --> 02:06:07.793]  I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing for the top long game here.
[02:06:08.693 --> 02:06:16.479]  And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers, to hack into government... And show the crimes you're committing?
[02:06:16.519 --> 02:06:20.122]  Hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.
[02:06:20.142 --> 02:06:20.783]  Because you're an enemy?
[02:06:20.883 --> 02:06:31.951]  And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to... And now the Feds need to come in and run the election for Hillary because of the Russians.
[02:06:32.011 --> 02:06:32.151]  Oh!
[02:06:33.032 --> 02:06:33.792]  Very clear.
[02:06:33.913 --> 02:06:37.054]  Whether it's Russia, China, Iran, or anybody else.
[02:06:37.074 --> 02:06:41.357]  The United States has much greater capacity.
[02:06:42.137 --> 02:06:45.299]  And we are not going to sit idly by and permit...
[02:06:49.321 --> 02:06:53.444]  Our private sector information or our public sector information.
[02:06:53.785 --> 02:06:59.970]  And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.
[02:07:00.010 --> 02:07:03.192]  We don't want to engage in a different kind of work here.
[02:07:03.272 --> 02:07:04.914]  All the backdoor chips you're putting everybody's computers?
[02:07:04.934 --> 02:07:06.695]  Go ahead, show everybody what you did, lady!
[02:07:06.715 --> 02:07:07.355]  Let's get it going!
[02:07:07.375 --> 02:07:08.977]  The Russians need to understand that.
[02:07:09.517 --> 02:07:10.738]  Who bought them TVs?
[02:07:10.758 --> 02:07:12.459]  Tell me that!
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:15.242]  How far we are, how much we will do.
[02:07:15.262 --> 02:07:16.222]  And that's why I was so
[02:07:17.083 --> 02:07:23.387]  I was so shocked when Donald Trump publicly invited me to hack into their business.
[02:07:23.467 --> 02:07:24.908]  That is just unacceptable.
[02:07:25.008 --> 02:07:36.714]  It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officers and Republican administration have said that Donald is not fit to be commander in chief.
[02:07:36.774 --> 02:07:42.798]  It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threat that we face.
[02:07:42.838 --> 02:07:44.619]  We have two minutes in the same question.
[02:07:45.539 --> 02:07:49.841]  I do want to say that I was just endorsed, and more are coming next week.
[02:07:49.881 --> 02:07:51.181]  It'll be over 200.
[02:07:51.881 --> 02:07:53.222]  Admirals, many of them are here.
[02:07:53.422 --> 02:07:57.863]  Admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.
[02:07:58.043 --> 02:08:01.004]  That just happened, and many more are coming.
[02:08:01.825 --> 02:08:02.905]  And I'm very proud of it.
[02:08:03.665 --> 02:08:05.506]  In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.
[02:08:05.846 --> 02:08:08.467]  They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.
[02:08:09.287 --> 02:08:10.548]  I was just endorsed by ICE.
[02:08:10.888 --> 02:08:12.928]  I was just recently endorsed 16,500 Border Patrol agents.
[02:08:15.329 --> 02:08:26.938]  So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years.
[02:08:26.958 --> 02:08:28.379]  We're fact-checking live.
[02:08:28.419 --> 02:08:28.999]  That's what this is.
[02:08:29.019 --> 02:08:30.300]  Look at the mess that we're in.
[02:08:30.641 --> 02:08:31.701]  Look at the mess that we're in.
[02:08:31.782 --> 02:08:33.323]  As far as the cyber, I agree.
[02:08:34.043 --> 02:08:36.144]  To parts of what Secretary Clinton said.
[02:08:37.184 --> 02:08:39.865]  We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.
[02:08:40.225 --> 02:08:43.406]  I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.
[02:08:43.446 --> 02:08:44.527]  She's saying Russia, Russia.
[02:08:44.547 --> 02:08:46.087]  No, it was a Democratic staffer.
[02:08:46.107 --> 02:08:47.488]  He got shot in the back four times.
[02:08:47.508 --> 02:08:48.528]  But it could also be China.
[02:08:48.548 --> 02:08:50.209]  It could also be lots of other people.
[02:08:50.249 --> 02:08:54.430]  It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay?
[02:08:54.930 --> 02:08:57.852]  You don't know who broke into DNC.
[02:08:58.092 --> 02:08:59.592]  But what did we learn with DNC?
[02:08:59.912 --> 02:09:01.373]  We learned that Bernie Sanders
[02:09:02.250 --> 02:09:05.771]  Was taken advantage of by your people.
[02:09:06.532 --> 02:09:08.592]  By Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[02:09:08.652 --> 02:09:09.493]  Look what happened to her.
[02:09:10.033 --> 02:09:12.974]  But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.
[02:09:13.014 --> 02:09:13.614]  That's what we know.
[02:09:13.654 --> 02:09:18.636]  Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know.
[02:09:18.656 --> 02:09:19.396]  You stole the nomination.
[02:09:19.416 --> 02:09:24.998]  Because the truth is, under President Obama, we've lost control of things that we used to have control of.
[02:09:25.018 --> 02:09:25.298]  Go after her.
[02:09:25.559 --> 02:09:26.999]  She stole the nomination.
[02:09:27.019 --> 02:09:27.999]  We can leave with the internet.
[02:09:28.019 --> 02:09:29.360]  Give her the coup de grace.
[02:09:29.660 --> 02:09:35.043]  And I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much when you look at what ISIS is doing with the internet.
[02:09:35.223 --> 02:09:37.744]  They're beating us in our own game.
[02:09:37.984 --> 02:09:38.284]  ISIS.
[02:09:38.964 --> 02:09:42.886]  So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.
[02:09:44.087 --> 02:09:45.788]  It is a huge problem.
[02:09:45.828 --> 02:09:46.388]  I have a son.
[02:09:46.408 --> 02:09:47.709]  He's 10 years old.
[02:09:48.409 --> 02:09:49.229]  He has computers.
[02:09:49.469 --> 02:09:51.030]  He is so good with these computers.
[02:09:51.090 --> 02:09:51.931]  It's unbelievable.
[02:09:52.911 --> 02:09:59.158]  The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough, and maybe it's hardly doable.
[02:09:59.939 --> 02:10:03.022]  But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.
[02:10:03.042 --> 02:10:06.145]  But that's true throughout our whole government.
[02:10:06.706 --> 02:10:10.870]  We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.
[02:10:13.029 --> 02:10:16.753]  Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.
[02:10:17.373 --> 02:10:20.737]  I look forward to a plan to defeat ISIS.
[02:10:21.538 --> 02:10:24.441]  It does involve going after them online.
[02:10:24.501 --> 02:10:36.193]  I think we need to do much more with tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the internet to radicalize, even direct
[02:10:37.133 --> 02:10:39.173]  People in our country, in Europe, and elsewhere.
[02:10:39.194 --> 02:10:41.634]  We want to pass internet censorship laws on the back of the groups she created.
[02:10:41.654 --> 02:10:42.474]  That's an important club.
[02:10:42.494 --> 02:10:57.757]  We also have to intensify our Arab strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa and their claim of being a caliphate.
[02:10:58.177 --> 02:10:59.457]  We're making progress.
[02:10:59.617 --> 02:11:01.858]  Our military is assisting in Iraq.
[02:11:03.059 --> 02:11:11.125]  And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.
[02:11:12.106 --> 02:11:21.675]  But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons.
[02:11:22.035 --> 02:11:24.697]  So we have to make this the top priority.
[02:11:24.777 --> 02:11:28.961]  And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.
[02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:37.226]  I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al-Qaeda leadership when I was Secretary of State, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.
[02:11:37.246 --> 02:11:51.234]  And I think we need to go after Baghdadi as well, make that one of our organizing principles, because we've got to defeat ISIS and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.
[02:11:51.514 --> 02:11:59.839]  You mentioned ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil.
[02:11:59.859 --> 02:12:09.705]  The latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, and the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando.
[02:12:10.405 --> 02:12:11.546]  I'll ask this to both of you.
[02:12:11.606 --> 02:12:16.909]  Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump.
[02:12:16.949 --> 02:12:19.211]  Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.
[02:12:20.402 --> 02:12:22.824]  Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.
[02:12:22.884 --> 02:12:24.125]  We will take out ISIS.
[02:12:24.826 --> 02:12:31.932]  Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq.
[02:12:32.692 --> 02:12:37.677]  Because they got out, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.
[02:12:38.553 --> 02:12:39.694]  And ISIS was formed.
[02:12:40.034 --> 02:12:41.436]  So she talks about taking them out.
[02:12:41.456 --> 02:12:42.397]  She's been doing it a long time.
[02:12:42.417 --> 02:12:44.278]  She's been trying to take them out for a long time.
[02:12:45.079 --> 02:12:53.487]  But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.
[02:12:53.927 --> 02:12:55.148]  And then you wouldn't have had them.
[02:12:55.909 --> 02:12:59.572]  Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree because I said it to you once,
[02:13:00.453 --> 02:13:09.440]  Had we taken the oil, and we should have taken the oil, ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.
[02:13:10.101 --> 02:13:16.826]  And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil, a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.
[02:13:17.667 --> 02:13:18.247]  Secretary Clinton?
[02:13:19.068 --> 02:13:23.672]  Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.
[02:13:25.211 --> 02:13:27.432]  Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.
[02:13:27.692 --> 02:13:27.992]  Wrong.
[02:13:28.032 --> 02:13:31.154]  That is absolutely proved over and over again.
[02:13:31.534 --> 02:13:41.498]  We actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gaddafi be taken out after actually doing some business with him one time.
[02:13:41.978 --> 02:13:48.421]  But the larger point, he says this constantly, is George W. Bush
[02:13:49.302 --> 02:13:55.219]  made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.
[02:13:56.132 --> 02:14:06.478]  And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then Iraqi government that would have protected our troops.
[02:14:06.618 --> 02:14:09.220]  And the Iraqi government would not give that.
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:13.022]  But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.
[02:14:13.042 --> 02:14:15.284]  The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?
[02:14:15.324 --> 02:14:16.845]  That's the most important part of this.
[02:14:17.285 --> 02:14:19.346]  How do we prevent attacks?
[02:14:19.406 --> 02:14:21.428]  How do we protect our people?
[02:14:22.208 --> 02:14:28.310]  I think we've got to have an intelligence surge where we are looking for every scrap of information.
[02:14:28.730 --> 02:14:32.891]  I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.
[02:14:32.951 --> 02:14:34.331]  I thought you said it wasn't a bombing.
[02:14:34.351 --> 02:14:35.492]  I thought you said it wasn't a bombing.
[02:14:35.512 --> 02:14:39.073]  They responded so quickly and so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.
[02:14:39.093 --> 02:14:40.653]  She's now proud of the terror attacks she said didn't happen.
[02:14:41.213 --> 02:14:50.141]  And they brought him down, and we may find out more information because he's still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.
[02:14:50.581 --> 02:14:57.007]  So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.
[02:14:57.407 --> 02:15:00.129]  That means we've got to work more closely with our allies.
[02:15:00.149 --> 02:15:04.153]  And that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.
[02:15:04.933 --> 02:15:13.285]  We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.
[02:15:13.646 --> 02:15:18.913]  We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim-majority nations.
[02:15:20.776 --> 02:15:22.377]  They don't even let law enforcement in.
[02:15:45.054 --> 02:15:46.597]  I have to respond.
[02:15:46.617 --> 02:15:47.338]  Please respond.
[02:15:53.444 --> 02:15:57.366]  The Secretary said very strongly about working with.
[02:15:57.406 --> 02:15:58.887]  We've been working with them for many years.
[02:15:59.587 --> 02:16:01.968]  And we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.
[02:16:01.988 --> 02:16:03.649]  You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.
[02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:05.850]  Under your direction to a large extent.
[02:16:06.491 --> 02:16:07.531]  But you look at the Middle East.
[02:16:07.551 --> 02:16:08.752]  You started the Iran deal.
[02:16:08.792 --> 02:16:12.974]  That's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall.
[02:16:13.034 --> 02:16:14.274]  I mean, they were doing so badly.
[02:16:14.555 --> 02:16:16.035]  They were choking on the sanctions.
[02:16:16.155 --> 02:16:21.178]  And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.
[02:16:21.678 --> 02:16:26.682]  But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?
[02:16:26.702 --> 02:16:28.323]  Now you have to understand, I'm a business person.
[02:16:28.783 --> 02:16:30.965]  I did really well, but I have common sense.
[02:16:31.685 --> 02:16:32.726]  And I said, well, I'll tell you.
[02:16:33.246 --> 02:16:35.848]  I haven't given lots of thought to NATO, but two things.
[02:16:36.209 --> 02:16:40.151]  Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.
[02:16:40.672 --> 02:16:48.177]  Number two, and that bothers me, because we should be, we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty.
[02:16:49.298 --> 02:16:49.979]  And contract.
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:17:01.631]  And number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete because, and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest.
[02:17:02.312 --> 02:17:05.815]  But I said, they do not focus on terror.
[02:17:06.696 --> 02:17:18.949]  And I was very strong, and I said it numerous times, and about four months ago I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division, and I think that's great.
[02:17:19.350 --> 02:17:28.299]  And I think we should get, because we pay approximately 73% of the cost of NATO, it's a lot of money to protect other people, but I'm all for NATO.
[02:17:29.039 --> 02:17:31.140]  But I said they have to focus on terror also.
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:31.880]  And they're going to do that.
[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:40.042]  And that was, believe me, I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it, but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.
[02:17:40.062 --> 02:17:40.642]  He was right.
[02:17:40.662 --> 02:17:41.562]  He raised that issue.
[02:17:41.622 --> 02:17:49.625]  We have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS.
[02:17:49.865 --> 02:17:51.245]  And we have to do it fast.
[02:17:51.685 --> 02:17:57.267]  When ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton,
[02:17:58.411 --> 02:18:01.712]  And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.
[02:18:01.732 --> 02:18:02.992]  Not only that, you named the day.
[02:18:03.033 --> 02:18:03.713]  They couldn't believe it.
[02:18:03.753 --> 02:18:06.093]  They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.
[02:18:06.113 --> 02:18:07.494]  They said, no, wait a minute.
[02:18:07.514 --> 02:18:11.895]  When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.
[02:18:12.355 --> 02:18:13.836]  It should have never happened.
[02:18:13.936 --> 02:18:15.556]  And you're talking about taking out ISIS.
[02:18:15.717 --> 02:18:19.718]  But you were there and you were Secretary of State when I was a little infant.
[02:18:20.598 --> 02:18:22.659]  Now it's in over 30 countries.
[02:18:23.220 --> 02:18:24.240]  And you're going to stop them?
[02:18:24.481 --> 02:18:25.161]  I don't think so.
[02:18:36.428 --> 02:18:43.991]  That's mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.
[02:18:44.011 --> 02:18:48.093]  My question is, since you supported her, why is 23 minutes left?
[02:18:48.533 --> 02:18:51.835]  I was against the war in Iraq, just so you put it out there.
[02:18:51.855 --> 02:18:52.975]  The record shows otherwise.
[02:18:53.055 --> 02:18:54.836]  The record does not show that.
[02:18:54.856 --> 02:18:56.377]  The record shows that I'm right.
[02:18:57.202 --> 02:19:06.549]  When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows, essentially.
[02:19:07.150 --> 02:19:12.454]  I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto, we talked about the economy is more important.
[02:19:13.034 --> 02:19:16.917]  I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.
[02:19:17.358 --> 02:19:21.981]  I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox, and Sean Hannity said,
[02:19:22.887 --> 02:19:26.109]  And he called me the other day, and I spoke to him about it.
[02:19:26.469 --> 02:19:30.252]  He said, you were totally against war, because he was for the war.
[02:19:30.312 --> 02:19:32.133]  And that was before the war started.
[02:19:32.614 --> 02:19:38.458]  Sean Hannity said very strongly, to me and other people, he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.
[02:19:39.338 --> 02:19:40.279]  I was against the war.
[02:19:40.319 --> 02:19:43.622]  He said, you used to have fights with me because Sean was in favor of the war.
[02:19:44.102 --> 02:19:48.747]  And I understand that side also, not very much because we should have never been there.
[02:19:49.327 --> 02:19:50.929]  But nobody calls Sean Hannity.
[02:19:51.309 --> 02:20:02.038]  And then they did an article in a major magazine shortly after the war started, I think in 04, but they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.
[02:20:02.822 --> 02:20:10.090]  And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely, because if you read this article, there's no doubt.
[02:20:10.791 --> 02:20:17.299]  But if somebody, and I'll ask the press, if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.
[02:20:17.839 --> 02:20:20.100]  He and I used to have arguments about the war.
[02:20:20.220 --> 02:20:21.981]  I said it's a terrible and a stupid thing.
[02:20:22.001 --> 02:20:22.601]  I remember hearing it.
[02:20:22.721 --> 02:20:26.643]  It's going to destabilize the Middle East, and that's exactly what it's done.
[02:20:26.723 --> 02:20:27.323]  It's been a disaster.
[02:20:27.343 --> 02:20:33.166]  My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was, why is your judgment any different than...
[02:20:33.926 --> 02:20:36.267]  Well, I have much better judgment than she does.
[02:20:36.487 --> 02:20:37.567]  There's no question about that.
[02:20:37.947 --> 02:20:40.568]  I also have a much better temperament than she has.
[02:20:41.188 --> 02:20:55.573]  You know, I have a much better... She spent, let me tell you, she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising, you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names, oh, temperament, let's go after... I think my strongest asset
[02:20:56.505 --> 02:20:58.206]  Maybe by far, it's my temperament.
[02:20:58.727 --> 02:21:00.028]  I have a winning temperament.
[02:21:00.048 --> 02:21:00.808]  I know how to win.
[02:21:01.389 --> 02:21:02.950]  She does not have a winning temperament.
[02:21:03.530 --> 02:21:13.237]  The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.
[02:21:13.717 --> 02:21:18.040]  I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:25.041]  Ten more minutes, don't collapse, sweetie.
[02:21:25.121 --> 02:21:30.643]  Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald.
[02:21:30.703 --> 02:21:31.323]  First, NATO.
[02:21:32.163 --> 02:21:37.665]  You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this.
[02:21:37.725 --> 02:21:38.325]  I gotta give it to her.
[02:21:38.345 --> 02:21:39.865]  An attack on one is an attack on all.
[02:21:39.885 --> 02:21:40.725]  Yeah, it's a mutual defense pact.
[02:21:40.745 --> 02:21:43.766]  Do you know the only time it's ever been invoked?
[02:21:44.507 --> 02:21:44.747]  After 9-11.
[02:21:46.311 --> 02:21:54.502]  When the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism.
[02:21:54.983 --> 02:21:58.668]  Something that they still are doing by our side.
[02:21:59.639 --> 02:22:08.547]  With respect to Iran, when I became Secretary of State, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.
[02:22:09.247 --> 02:22:13.110]  They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.
[02:22:13.191 --> 02:22:15.092]  They had built covert facilities.
[02:22:15.452 --> 02:22:18.955]  They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.
[02:22:19.736 --> 02:22:21.477]  And we had sanctioned them.
[02:22:21.957 --> 02:22:26.359]  I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.
[02:22:26.879 --> 02:22:34.622]  So I spent a year and a half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest
[02:22:35.502 --> 02:22:36.703]  Sanctions on Iran.
[02:22:37.343 --> 02:22:40.064]  And we did drive them to the negotiating table.
[02:22:40.705 --> 02:22:48.868]  And my successor John Kerry and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program.
[02:22:48.908 --> 02:22:50.969]  Without firing a single shot.
[02:22:51.350 --> 02:22:52.690]  That's diplomacy.
[02:22:52.910 --> 02:22:54.531]  That's coalition building.
[02:22:54.591 --> 02:22:56.272]  That's working with other nations.
[02:22:56.672 --> 02:23:02.215]  The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship
[02:23:03.035 --> 02:23:09.440]  In the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting America's sailors who were on a nearby ship.
[02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:16.125]  He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.
[02:23:16.145 --> 02:23:17.126]  That's what Reagan did.
[02:23:17.446 --> 02:23:18.827]  That's not good judgment.
[02:23:19.247 --> 02:23:22.950]  That is not the right temperament to be Commander-in-Chief.
[02:23:24.727 --> 02:23:25.228]  Taunted.
[02:23:25.708 --> 02:23:31.274]  And the worst part of what we've heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.
[02:23:31.294 --> 02:23:36.519]  He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons.
[02:23:36.559 --> 02:23:38.861]  Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.
[02:23:39.382 --> 02:23:45.187]  It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could
[02:23:45.788 --> 02:23:46.369]  That's right.
[02:24:05.123 --> 02:24:15.388]  That is the number one threat we face in the world, and it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.
[02:24:15.588 --> 02:24:20.930]  So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes.
[02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:23.372]  Well, the generals don't want you to have anybody near that.
[02:24:23.472 --> 02:24:26.213]  Anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.
[02:24:26.313 --> 02:24:27.834]  It's not an accurate one at all.
[02:24:32.876 --> 02:24:33.817]  It's not an accurate one.
[02:24:34.238 --> 02:24:39.784]  So, I just want to give a lot of... I agree with her on one thing.
[02:24:39.884 --> 02:24:46.791]  The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons.
[02:24:46.871 --> 02:24:51.756]  Not global warming like you think in your presidency.
[02:24:51.776 --> 02:24:54.539]  Nuclear is the single greatest threat.
[02:24:55.380 --> 02:25:03.367]  Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.
[02:25:03.827 --> 02:25:10.873]  They do not pay us, but they should be paying us because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.
[02:25:11.033 --> 02:25:13.636]  That's why we're losing, we're losing, we lose on everything.
[02:25:13.876 --> 02:25:15.297]  That's right, Hillary's screwing us over.
[02:25:15.537 --> 02:25:16.318]  We lose on everything.
[02:25:16.718 --> 02:25:24.703]  Well, I said that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.
[02:25:25.303 --> 02:25:29.886]  We can't defend Japan, a behemoth selling us cars by the million.
[02:25:29.906 --> 02:25:31.246]  We need to move on.
[02:25:31.286 --> 02:25:32.127]  But it's very important.
[02:25:32.487 --> 02:25:36.850]  All I said was they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.
[02:25:37.230 --> 02:25:39.611]  We're a country that owes $20 trillion.
[02:25:39.891 --> 02:25:40.892]  They have to help us out.
[02:25:41.252 --> 02:25:44.453]  As far as the nuclear is concerned... Yeah, quit screwing us over!
[02:25:44.853 --> 02:25:47.254]  ...it is the single greatest threat to this country.
[02:25:47.274 --> 02:25:54.497]  Our politicians have become like used car sales, which leads to my next question as we enter our last segment here on the still on the subject of securing America on nuclear weapons.
[02:25:54.617 --> 02:25:56.438]  President Obama... Only six minutes left.
[02:25:56.458 --> 02:26:00.039]  ...reportedly considering changing the nation's long-standing policy on first use.
[02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:02.340]  Do you support the current policy?
[02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:03.621]  Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.
[02:26:03.641 --> 02:26:08.983]  Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia,
[02:26:09.483 --> 02:26:13.087]  She's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.
[02:26:13.608 --> 02:26:14.909]  But Russia's been expanding.
[02:26:15.550 --> 02:26:19.134]  They have a much newer capability than we do.
[02:26:19.194 --> 02:26:22.698]  We have not been updating from the new standpoint.
[02:26:22.718 --> 02:26:23.479]  That's right.
[02:26:23.499 --> 02:26:28.525]  I was seeing B-52s there, old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.
[02:26:30.447 --> 02:26:32.389]  We are not keeping up with other countries.
[02:26:32.469 --> 02:26:37.836]  I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it, but I would certainly not do first strike.
[02:26:37.936 --> 02:26:43.682]  I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.
[02:26:44.203 --> 02:26:46.105]  At the same time, we have to be prepared.
[02:26:46.145 --> 02:26:47.467]  I can't take anything off the table.
[02:26:47.487 --> 02:26:48.147]  He just got my vote.
[02:26:48.227 --> 02:26:51.031]  Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea.
[02:26:55.294 --> 02:26:56.995]  China should go into North Korea.
[02:26:57.516 --> 02:27:02.480]  China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:07.504]  And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started, the Iran deal.
[02:27:09.005 --> 02:27:10.226]  One of their biggest trading partners.
[02:27:10.287 --> 02:27:12.929]  Iran has power over North Korea.
[02:27:13.090 --> 02:27:15.232]  But they made that horrible deal with Iran.
[02:27:15.753 --> 02:27:21.839]  They should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.
[02:27:22.180 --> 02:27:25.603]  And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.
[02:27:26.144 --> 02:27:26.664]  And when asked...
[02:27:27.185 --> 02:27:29.627]  To Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?
[02:27:29.767 --> 02:27:32.229]  Why didn't you add other things into the deal?
[02:27:32.569 --> 02:27:34.471]  One of the great giveaways of all time.
[02:27:35.011 --> 02:27:35.592]  Of all time.
[02:27:35.852 --> 02:27:39.255]  Including 400 million dollars in cash.
[02:27:40.151 --> 02:27:41.372]  Nobody's ever seen that before.
[02:27:41.392 --> 02:27:42.152]  Now it's a billion point six.
[02:27:42.172 --> 02:27:42.953]  That turned out to be wrong.
[02:27:43.233 --> 02:27:45.655]  It was actually 1.7 billion dollars.
[02:27:45.775 --> 02:27:46.015]  You're right, 1.7.
[02:27:46.075 --> 02:27:46.655]  In cash.
[02:27:47.175 --> 02:27:51.098]  Obviously, in cash for the hostages, it certainly looks that way.
[02:27:51.758 --> 02:27:52.719]  He's so informed.
[02:27:53.279 --> 02:27:55.741]  Why didn't they make the right deal?
[02:27:55.961 --> 02:28:01.024]  This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.
[02:28:01.525 --> 02:28:03.266]  The deal with Iran will lead
[02:28:04.209 --> 02:28:05.449]  To nuclear problems.
[02:28:05.529 --> 02:28:11.171]  All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much, and they're going to end up getting nuclear amendments.
[02:28:11.291 --> 02:28:14.732]  BB Netanyahu the other day, believe me, he is not a happy camper.
[02:28:15.712 --> 02:28:18.412]  Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.
[02:28:18.772 --> 02:28:21.053]  Let me start by saying words matter.
[02:28:21.793 --> 02:28:26.314]  Words matter when you run for president, and they really matter when you are president.
[02:28:27.555 --> 02:28:32.736]  And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere
[02:28:33.700 --> 02:28:35.821]  That we have mutual defense treaties.
[02:28:38.483 --> 02:28:41.985]  It is essential that America's word be good.
[02:28:42.706 --> 02:28:50.891]  So I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and some worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.
[02:28:51.231 --> 02:28:52.672]  I've talked with a number of them.
[02:28:52.952 --> 02:29:03.461]  But I want to, on behalf of myself and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that our word is good.
[02:29:03.962 --> 02:29:09.187]  It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.
[02:29:10.876 --> 02:29:22.005]  There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran, but personally I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.
[02:29:22.666 --> 02:29:24.708]  And Donald never tells you what he would do.
[02:29:25.148 --> 02:29:26.249]  Would he have started a war?
[02:29:26.669 --> 02:29:27.850]  Would he have bombed Iran?
[02:29:28.311 --> 02:29:37.538]  If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before,
[02:29:38.439 --> 02:29:44.318]  Then he should tell us what his alternative would be, but it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.
[02:29:45.083 --> 02:29:49.525]  He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.
[02:29:50.005 --> 02:29:53.987]  He said bomb the oil, bomb the supply routes, stop having the U.S.
[02:29:54.027 --> 02:29:54.848]  military support him.
[02:29:54.868 --> 02:29:56.409]  Stop having the U.S.
[02:29:56.429 --> 02:29:58.530]  military, hellfire of the Syrian military.
[02:29:58.550 --> 02:30:03.572]  He can't say the secret plan because it's so damn embarrassing what you and Obama have done!
[02:30:03.592 --> 02:30:04.252]  He can't say it!
[02:30:04.272 --> 02:30:05.713]  Because our government's running it!
[02:30:05.733 --> 02:30:07.674]  That's why it's secret, lady, and you know it!
[02:30:11.996 --> 02:30:27.800]  I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.
[02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:30.861]  We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world
[02:30:32.881 --> 02:30:39.346]  To interfere with American interests and security to be given any opportunities at all.
[02:30:39.767 --> 02:30:41.328]  Let's do one thing I'd like to say.
[02:30:41.388 --> 02:30:41.968]  Very quickly.
[02:30:41.988 --> 02:30:54.199]  I won't go very quickly, but I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.
[02:30:54.239 --> 02:31:00.304]  Right now it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.
[02:31:00.744 --> 02:31:01.745]  And it's a big problem.
[02:31:02.205 --> 02:31:05.971]  And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies.
[02:31:06.652 --> 02:31:08.595]  But we are losing.
[02:31:09.798 --> 02:31:11.680]  Billions and billions of dollars.
[02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:14.162]  We cannot be the policeman of the world.
[02:31:14.522 --> 02:31:20.187]  We cannot protect countries all over the world where they're not paying us what we need.
[02:31:20.427 --> 02:31:21.768]  We have just a few final questions.
[02:31:21.788 --> 02:31:23.930]  She doesn't say that because she's got no business ability.
[02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:28.153]  We need heart, we need a lot of things, but you have to have some basic ability.
[02:31:28.594 --> 02:31:30.375]  And sadly, she doesn't have that.
[02:31:30.575 --> 02:31:32.237]  All of the things that she's talking about
[02:31:32.597 --> 02:31:37.279]  Could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.
[02:31:37.679 --> 02:31:38.899]  But they weren't taken care of.
[02:31:39.219 --> 02:31:41.820]  And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.
[02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:46.442]  Mr. Trump, this year, Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party.
[02:31:46.522 --> 02:31:50.183]  Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, a presidential look.
[02:31:50.583 --> 02:31:52.304]  She's standing here right now.
[02:31:52.384 --> 02:31:53.164]  What did you mean by that?
[02:31:53.989 --> 02:31:56.610]  She doesn't have the look, she doesn't have the stamina.
[02:31:57.271 --> 02:31:59.131]  I said she doesn't have the stamina.
[02:31:59.832 --> 02:32:02.333]  And I don't believe she does have the stamina.
[02:32:04.794 --> 02:32:06.475]  You need tremendous stamina.
[02:32:06.955 --> 02:32:09.776]  Wait a minute, let's see, ask me a question.
[02:32:10.036 --> 02:32:10.937]  Did you ask me a question?
[02:32:12.216 --> 02:32:15.658]  You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.
[02:32:15.959 --> 02:32:21.562]  You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.
[02:32:21.582 --> 02:32:28.287]  I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia, and with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying.
[02:32:28.307 --> 02:32:29.588]  All you have to do is speak to them.
[02:32:29.608 --> 02:32:37.093]  Wait, you have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.
[02:32:37.213 --> 02:32:38.093]  Let's let her respond.
[02:32:38.553 --> 02:32:40.094]  This debate's now been over 90 minutes.
[02:32:40.154 --> 02:32:40.614]  I love it.
[02:32:40.654 --> 02:33:00.999]  As soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a ceasefire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.
[02:33:03.533 --> 02:33:06.816]  We need someone outside the system, not a globalist!
[02:33:06.956 --> 02:33:10.398]  Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.
[02:33:11.079 --> 02:33:17.464]  We have made so many bad deals during the last... So she's got experience, that I agree, but it's bad.
[02:33:17.604 --> 02:33:21.507]  Hillary has experience of being a traitor, that's the last clip.
[02:33:21.567 --> 02:33:23.929]  Hillary has the experience of a traitor.
[02:33:24.810 --> 02:33:28.633]  Whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can...
[02:33:29.814 --> 02:33:31.295]  You almost can't name a good deal.
[02:33:31.515 --> 02:33:31.935]  I agree.
[02:33:32.276 --> 02:33:34.457]  She's got experience, but it's bad experience.
[02:33:34.718 --> 02:33:39.642]  And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.
[02:33:42.690 --> 02:33:48.894]  He tried to switch from looks to stamina.
[02:33:49.894 --> 02:33:54.257]  But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs, and dogs.
[02:33:54.777 --> 02:34:00.901]  And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers.
[02:34:01.789 --> 02:34:07.936]  Who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.
[02:34:08.016 --> 02:34:14.444]  And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.
[02:34:14.724 --> 02:34:18.308]  He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.
[02:34:19.209 --> 02:34:21.833]  And he called this woman Miss Piggy.
[02:34:23.157 --> 02:34:27.041]  Then he called her Miss Housekeeping because she was Latina.
[02:34:27.782 --> 02:34:28.683]  Donald, she has a name.
[02:34:28.703 --> 02:34:29.243]  Where did you find it?
[02:34:29.283 --> 02:34:31.465]  Her name is Alicia Machado.
[02:34:31.505 --> 02:34:32.126]  Where did you find it?
[02:34:32.146 --> 02:34:34.108]  And she has become a U.S.
[02:34:34.128 --> 02:34:37.952]  citizen, and you can bet she's going to vote this November.
[02:34:37.972 --> 02:34:38.352]  Okay, good.
[02:34:38.793 --> 02:34:39.573]  Let me just tell you...
[02:34:40.874 --> 02:34:45.695]  You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.
[02:34:46.215 --> 02:34:51.897]  Some of it said in entertainment, some of it said somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell.
[02:34:51.957 --> 02:34:53.357]  I said very tough things to her.
[02:34:53.377 --> 02:34:54.878]  The elite is behind Hillary.
[02:34:55.238 --> 02:34:57.438]  That she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.
[02:34:57.758 --> 02:34:58.939]  But you want to know the truth?
[02:34:59.419 --> 02:35:08.481]  I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself,
[02:35:09.471 --> 02:35:10.031]  I can't do it.
[02:35:10.231 --> 02:35:11.012]  I just can't do it.
[02:35:11.452 --> 02:35:12.432]  It's inappropriate.
[02:35:12.852 --> 02:35:13.532]  It's not nice.
[02:35:13.552 --> 02:35:14.092]  You'll do it tomorrow.
[02:35:14.112 --> 02:35:20.975]  She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.
[02:35:21.235 --> 02:35:23.355]  They're untrue and they're misrepresentations.
[02:35:23.375 --> 02:35:23.615]  Get her.
[02:35:24.016 --> 02:35:32.018]  And I will tell you this, Lester, it's not nice and I don't deserve that, but it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.
[02:35:32.598 --> 02:35:37.420]  It's hundreds of millions of ads and the only gratifying thing is I saw the polls come in today
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:44.047]  And with all of that money, over $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied.
[02:35:44.287 --> 02:35:45.889]  And I've spent practically nothing.
[02:35:45.969 --> 02:35:49.013]  One of you will not win this election.
[02:35:49.093 --> 02:35:54.359]  So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters?
[02:35:54.379 --> 02:35:54.960]  Secretary Clinton?
[02:35:55.060 --> 02:36:14.609]  Well I support our democracy, and sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but I certainly will support the outcome of this election, and I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand, this election's really up to you.
[02:36:15.109 --> 02:36:21.012]  It's not about us, so much as it is about you and your family for the kind of country and future you want.
[02:36:21.052 --> 02:36:21.953]  That's another big story.
[02:36:22.873 --> 02:36:30.995]  Hillary denies election fraud, but federalizes elections.
[02:36:31.295 --> 02:36:33.456]  I want to make America great again.
[02:36:33.856 --> 02:36:36.497]  We are a nation that is seriously troubled.
[02:36:36.957 --> 02:36:40.058]  We're losing our jobs, people are pouring into our country.
[02:36:40.418 --> 02:36:42.099]  The other day we were deporting 800 people.
[02:36:43.599 --> 02:36:49.746]  And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps, worse than that, it was corruption.
[02:36:50.146 --> 02:36:54.210]  But these people that we were going to deport, for good reason, ended up becoming citizens.
[02:36:55.391 --> 02:36:57.253]  Ended up becoming citizens.
[02:36:57.273 --> 02:36:57.614]  A button.
[02:36:57.634 --> 02:37:02.038]  And it was $800, and now it turns out it might be $1,800, and they don't even know.
[02:37:02.098 --> 02:37:03.500]  Will you accept the action of the election?
[02:37:03.900 --> 02:37:05.241]  I want to make America great again?
[02:37:06.374 --> 02:37:07.375]  I'm going to be able to do it.
[02:37:07.635 --> 02:37:08.916]  I don't believe Hillary will.
[02:37:08.956 --> 02:37:11.938]  The answer is if she wins, I will absolutely support her.
[02:37:12.258 --> 02:37:14.200]  Alright, well that is going to do it for us.
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:17.142]  That concludes our debate for this evening.
[02:37:17.202 --> 02:37:17.782]  A spirited one.
[02:37:17.802 --> 02:37:18.803]  We covered a lot of ground.
[02:37:18.843 --> 02:37:20.964]  Not everything as I suspected we wouldn't.
[02:37:22.045 --> 02:37:26.749]  The next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St.
[02:37:26.789 --> 02:37:27.029]  Louis.
[02:37:27.469 --> 02:37:27.609]  Wow!
[02:37:46.319 --> 02:37:49.901]  We've got multiple cameras there with this feed we subscribe to.
[02:37:51.582 --> 02:37:54.824]  So let's just sit here and watch what happens, because most people aren't going to get to see this.
[02:37:55.445 --> 02:37:56.606]  Let's put it back on full screen.
[02:37:56.646 --> 02:37:57.866]  Let's let this roll for a few minutes.
[02:37:58.247 --> 02:37:58.487]  Go ahead.
[02:37:59.948 --> 02:38:01.349]  We've got post coverage for two hours.
[02:38:04.521 --> 02:38:07.043]  Trump goes and shakes Lister Holt's hand.
[02:38:07.684 --> 02:38:09.926]  Hillary's creeping around like a spider who can barely walk.
[02:38:10.526 --> 02:38:12.288]  Webster Hubble's daughter is up there next to her.
[02:38:13.188 --> 02:38:16.691]  Bill, the guy that settles rape cases, creeps over.
[02:38:21.255 --> 02:38:22.356]  This is an epic video.
[02:38:22.376 --> 02:38:30.843]  If you're a radio listener at fullwords.com, fullwords.com slash show, we're going to have probably an hour and a half, maybe longer, live coverage and breakdowns of all this with David Knightley and Megadeth.
[02:38:32.875 --> 02:38:33.615]  We'll be here all night.
[02:38:33.716 --> 02:38:34.476]  Rob Dewey just popped in.
[02:38:34.496 --> 02:38:35.577]  You want to make any comments on this?
[02:38:36.657 --> 02:38:38.318]  Yeah, there was so much going on, Alex.
[02:38:38.378 --> 02:38:41.360]  It was just... Did he not tear the living hell out of him?
[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:41.761]  Yeah.
[02:38:42.121 --> 02:38:45.103]  No, it's not even funny what he did.
[02:38:46.243 --> 02:38:51.747]  And just some of the clips that you have... But let's go back while you're talking at the feet of this.
[02:38:51.807 --> 02:38:52.587]  Run that over top.
[02:38:52.627 --> 02:38:53.588]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:38:54.608 --> 02:38:55.909]  Yeah, she might fall at this point.
[02:38:55.929 --> 02:38:56.590]  We want to get that.
[02:38:57.614 --> 02:39:01.137]  Oh, Trump's over there, Bill Clinton's patting her on the back, like, you're good, you're good.
[02:39:01.558 --> 02:39:04.841]  I gotta be surprised, I actually said I thought she'd at least have a coffee, but I was proven wrong.
[02:39:05.221 --> 02:39:06.902]  She held it together like I was taking a week off.
[02:39:08.003 --> 02:39:12.467]  Yeah, well, and you notice how she said, oh, I was preparing to be president at that time.
[02:39:12.507 --> 02:39:16.451]  She was living in a cave, being injected with God knows what at that time.
[02:39:18.473 --> 02:39:18.653]  So.
[02:39:18.673 --> 02:39:22.717]  I just want to have, I want to have Mrs. Trump as the first lady.
[02:39:24.648 --> 02:39:29.909]  Have, like, sexy, like, uh, pent-up girls on the side of our cars or calendars.
[02:39:30.449 --> 02:39:31.569]  She's still on her feet, though.
[02:39:31.709 --> 02:39:32.189]  Look at that.
[02:39:33.309 --> 02:39:35.350]  I gotta tell ya, I mean, people say body double.
[02:39:35.370 --> 02:39:36.150]  No, that's Hillary Clinton.
[02:39:36.170 --> 02:39:38.910]  You can tell that's her, but, man, she looks like hell most of the time.
[02:39:39.170 --> 02:39:41.531]  She still doesn't look very good, but, I mean, she, she bounced back.
[02:39:41.851 --> 02:39:49.092]  I've gotta say, I, I think, I don't wanna say I was wrong, because I said, 50-50 she collapses, 80 percent she, 90 percent she has a coughing fit.
[02:39:49.132 --> 02:39:49.572]  She didn't!
[02:39:49.812 --> 02:39:53.373]  I mean... 17 infusions, that's, that'll help you.
[02:39:54.761 --> 02:39:57.023]  She does look like hell, but not as bad as she looked a week ago.
[02:39:58.044 --> 02:40:04.689]  Look, Bill's up there trying to gather some, uh... I know, I love you, I'm so... I'm not Dixon, Mafia, KKK, Grand Dragon.
[02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:09.533]  I'm bringing him that cocaine, it's all good.
[02:40:11.394 --> 02:40:11.955]  Is Trump left?
[02:40:13.294 --> 02:40:15.198]  Looks like he has left, so Hillary's still in the building.
[02:40:15.218 --> 02:40:16.080]  Prop has left the building.
[02:40:16.100 --> 02:40:16.962]  We're done looking at Hillary.
[02:40:16.982 --> 02:40:17.523]  Yeah.
[02:40:17.663 --> 02:40:20.810]  Ribbing how long she can sit up there with the Colossomy bags.
[02:40:20.850 --> 02:40:21.311]  Bill Clinton.
[02:40:21.972 --> 02:40:22.473]  Woo!
[02:40:22.513 --> 02:40:24.377]  Bill Clinton, please screw us over some more.
[02:40:26.820 --> 02:40:45.747]  You know, I was talking to a friend, you know about these Nigeria scams, where they get you to give $5,000 because Prince Abubu wants to give you a million, and then when the million doesn't come, give me $10,000 more, you get $5,000,000, and then, oh my God, it's locked up in customs, your money is there, if you just send us $5,000 more, you will get all this money, and you don't want to admit you've been conned, so you give the money.
[02:40:46.327 --> 02:40:48.448]  I was talking to folks, these scams on old ladies.
[02:40:50.216 --> 02:41:01.020]  Where the husband's dead, they know they're dead, they have databases, they send them emails, this young guy online, and then once they steal like $50,000 from him, like a year later they go, actually he wants to return the money to you but it's held up in customs.
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:03.921]  Just give $5,000 to $10,000 more, you get the money in.
[02:41:03.941 --> 02:41:12.864]  And that's what this is, just believe in it, believe in the scam, the Clintons that steal all this money from charities, they give, you know, less than 6% of the money, the little Haitian kids they steal.
[02:41:13.144 --> 02:41:14.525]  I mean, these are monsters.
[02:41:15.425 --> 02:41:18.228]  Look, Hillary's literally getting a medal for completing.
[02:41:18.629 --> 02:41:23.395]  You know, when you play sports with the little kids and stuff, you get a medal for just competing?
[02:41:23.735 --> 02:41:24.976]  That's what she's getting right now.
[02:41:25.036 --> 02:41:27.559]  She's getting like, oh my god, you made it to the end.
[02:41:27.900 --> 02:41:31.824]  Not whether you did good or not, Alex, it's just she made it to the end.
[02:41:31.844 --> 02:41:32.886]  That's what it's all about.
[02:41:34.292 --> 02:41:36.093]  All right, we have Roger Stone we're going to go to.
[02:41:36.113 --> 02:41:39.836]  Then we have Ashley, one of our reporters here.
[02:41:42.257 --> 02:41:48.061]  Beckford, who's an African-American lady, great patriot, longtime listener, great journalist.
[02:41:48.581 --> 02:41:50.583]  She went out to Schultz's Beer Garden earlier.
[02:41:51.870 --> 02:42:02.135]  With Josh Owens, one of our camera people, and the Democrats said that she was a race traitor and evil, that she was just independent and not supporting Hillary.
[02:42:03.696 --> 02:42:04.736]  That report's coming up.
[02:42:04.756 --> 02:42:15.401]  We're going to bring Leigh-Anne McAdoo in, David Knight's in the other studio, anybody from Buckley Hammond to Rob Duda, Marcos Morales to Adonis Salazar to Mikhail Thelen to
[02:42:18.004 --> 02:42:23.870]  Darren McBreen to Kellan McBreen to anybody that wants to pop in with questions for Stone is welcome to.
[02:42:23.890 --> 02:42:24.831]  He's with us for 30 minutes.
[02:42:26.096 --> 02:42:30.797]  And then we're going to continue for at least two hours tonight with your phone calls later and a lot more.
[02:42:30.817 --> 02:42:32.057]  But let's bring back to another Zen.
[02:42:32.817 --> 02:42:36.938]  Roger Stone, I'll give you my 96th minute.
[02:42:37.038 --> 02:42:38.058]  I love how they went over.
[02:42:38.658 --> 02:42:43.299]  They're admitting now 100 million viewers or more, biggest thing in history, showing this awakening.
[02:42:43.359 --> 02:42:45.059]  Reagan's debate was 80 million.
[02:42:45.359 --> 02:42:46.840]  You were there helping in the campaign.
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:49.840]  I was saying he wasn't being tough enough, but I think he was safe.
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:53.661]  And he really came off as really polished, focused,
[02:42:54.621 --> 02:42:57.845]  Uh, and I mean, I would give him an A plus in this overall.
[02:42:57.865 --> 02:43:00.107]  Uh, I don't want to just sit here and grovel.
[02:43:00.127 --> 02:43:01.468]  I mean, early on, I was a little bit concerned.
[02:43:01.748 --> 02:43:02.369]  Am I wrong?
[02:43:02.429 --> 02:43:04.091]  Or what do you, what do you make of this?
[02:43:04.131 --> 02:43:11.037]  I wish we would have heard about her sealing the Haitian, um, you know, money and, and, and giving less than, you know, 94%.
[02:43:11.478 --> 02:43:18.405]  I wish we would have heard about her founding ISIS, but I get, he's got to kind of play to a larger audience, but that's what got him here was being hardcore.
[02:43:18.925 --> 02:43:20.366]  We're not trying to play along with the system.
[02:43:20.386 --> 02:43:21.567]  We're trying to change the system.
[02:43:21.607 --> 02:43:24.850]  But regardless, I think he came off extremely presidential.
[02:43:25.270 --> 02:43:31.396]  She came off like a blown engine or like a mental patient.
[02:43:31.416 --> 02:43:32.056]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:43:32.096 --> 02:43:35.940]  What do you make of this, Roger Stone, former campaign head for Donald Trump?
[02:43:37.588 --> 02:43:40.450]  Well Alex, I agree with your assessment.
[02:43:41.051 --> 02:43:43.173]  I thought Trump did extremely well.
[02:43:44.794 --> 02:43:56.244]  There is always the challenge of debating a woman candidate and coming across as too harsh, yet his counter-punching was most effective.
[02:43:57.165 --> 02:44:01.088]  He seems to have followed the advice of Roger Ailes.
[02:44:01.564 --> 02:44:11.732]  Television genius who told him to remain thematic without getting down into the weeds and trying to outwonk Hillary.
[02:44:12.573 --> 02:44:13.814]  He looks strong.
[02:44:14.174 --> 02:44:15.415]  He looked cool.
[02:44:15.996 --> 02:44:17.857]  He looked collected.
[02:44:17.877 --> 02:44:22.401]  And of course, her comments continue to be outrageous.
[02:44:23.162 --> 02:44:27.966]  She's against the mandatory sentences that have devastated
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:37.663]  The black community, why those mandatory sentences were put in place by her husband and she was the cheerleader for that.
[02:44:37.723 --> 02:44:42.705]  That was really, it was hard for me to shut up because it was upside down world and I want to get to that and give you the floor in a moment.
[02:44:43.485 --> 02:44:44.785]  But I mean, absolutely Roger.
[02:44:44.805 --> 02:44:47.546]  It has a lot of quality to it.
[02:44:47.586 --> 02:44:50.027]  You know, it's like Alice in Wonderland.
[02:44:50.847 --> 02:44:57.210]  Their policies economically devastate the inner cities, but it's Donald Trump's fault.
[02:44:57.330 --> 02:44:58.130]  He's a racist.
[02:44:58.649 --> 02:45:04.535]  I mean, I don't want to do the deceptions, and I'm not being elitist here, but we're in this every day, we live this.
[02:45:04.936 --> 02:45:14.506]  Do we have a blind spot being informed that we see what a joke it is versus voters that are busy taking their kids to school, working 60 hours a week, paying the bills?
[02:45:14.566 --> 02:45:17.669]  Because to somebody informed, it looked like he literally
[02:45:18.948 --> 02:45:21.750]  Well, first of all, Alex, the debate was two-on-one.
[02:45:21.810 --> 02:45:24.571]  Lester Holt functioning largely as a Clinton quizling.
[02:45:25.252 --> 02:45:25.572]  But pathetic!
[02:45:49.219 --> 02:46:06.398]  The country has cataclysmic problems with our economy, with trade, with immigration, with security, and he wants to talk about birtherism, which, Hillary's lying again, undeniably started by her hatchet man,
[02:46:07.065 --> 02:46:16.829]  Sidney Blumenthal promulgated by her campaign guru, Mark Penn, and pushed by her campaign manager, Patty Salas Doyle.
[02:46:17.109 --> 02:46:18.410]  Sorry, CNN.
[02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:20.050]  Sorry, PolitiFacts.
[02:46:20.090 --> 02:46:23.452]  Those are facts, indisputable facts.
[02:46:25.332 --> 02:46:29.454]  Just one example of the lies of Hillary Clinton.
[02:46:32.156 --> 02:46:36.038]  I'm just speechless at this point because Trump looked more presidential.
[02:46:36.158 --> 02:46:37.318]  I'm not kissing his ass, it's true.
[02:46:37.379 --> 02:46:41.941]  He looked, under all the stress, skinnier, healthier, more focused, younger.
[02:46:42.301 --> 02:46:44.542]  This guy looks like he's 55, not 70.
[02:46:45.042 --> 02:46:49.444]  And I was thinking in my mind, he was finishing sentences as I was thinking of him.
[02:46:49.764 --> 02:46:54.567]  It's not that he's following what I say or you say, he's just so Americana, so dialed in.
[02:46:55.087 --> 02:46:57.348]  I'm not a messianic type guy, but I gotta tell ya.
[02:46:57.708 --> 02:47:03.369]  I'm thanking my lucky stars right now for Donald J. Trump, and I'm just admiring you for knowing the guy for 40 years.
[02:47:05.089 --> 02:47:08.170]  Well, look, I thought it was an excellent debate.
[02:47:08.750 --> 02:47:13.191]  He pulled a couple punches, but it's the first of three debates.
[02:47:13.271 --> 02:47:17.372]  I mean, there's plenty of time to talk about what really happened in Libya.
[02:47:17.932 --> 02:47:21.693]  There's plenty of time to talk about... So this was just to look presidential?
[02:47:21.933 --> 02:47:23.793]  Does he pull the knives out next debate?
[02:47:25.046 --> 02:47:31.637]  Well, I think he's going to go into the next debate even more comfortable and more confident than he went into this debate.
[02:47:31.717 --> 02:47:38.469]  You will notice in the Republican debates that he gained strength and confidence with every debate.
[02:47:39.051 --> 02:47:40.913]  I think that is true here.
[02:47:41.493 --> 02:47:49.139]  I think he now realizes that she's a totally programmed, automatic kind of robot.
[02:47:49.699 --> 02:47:56.825]  I don't know what kind of drugs they had her hopped up on tonight, but she could barely keep her eyes open if you look carefully.
[02:47:56.845 --> 02:47:58.666]  Well, that's anti-seizure medication.
[02:47:58.766 --> 02:47:59.187]  Absolutely.
[02:47:59.207 --> 02:48:01.188]  She did come off as an automaton.
[02:48:01.889 --> 02:48:02.970]  So what does that say about you?
[02:48:04.332 --> 02:48:06.013]  Well, Trump is genuine.
[02:48:06.133 --> 02:48:07.353]  Trump is authentic.
[02:48:07.633 --> 02:48:10.974]  Trump talks the way people talk around the dinner table.
[02:48:11.434 --> 02:48:18.936]  Hillary Clinton comes across as what she is, a skilled 30-year career politician.
[02:48:19.196 --> 02:48:31.360]  Unfortunately, with all her grandiose promises and plans, she and her party are responsible for the disaster of the last
[02:48:32.011 --> 02:48:32.472]  That's right.
[02:48:32.572 --> 02:48:33.513]  She can't dodge that.
[02:48:33.573 --> 02:48:35.435]  She's the author of our current pickle.
[02:48:35.735 --> 02:48:36.776]  She's not change.
[02:48:37.917 --> 02:48:39.079]  I've asked some of the questions.
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.283]  And now that George H.W.
[02:48:43.323 --> 02:48:48.809]  Bush has endorsed her, and I think Laura Bush is right behind, let's be candid.
[02:48:49.390 --> 02:48:52.754]  The Bushes and the Clintons together are responsible.
[02:48:53.983 --> 02:48:56.105]  Why didn't she refuse that albatross?
[02:48:56.145 --> 02:49:05.073]  Are they so disconnected in his, I'm sorry to say it, Alzheimer's brain, or I guess dementia brain, that they thought that was a good thing?
[02:49:06.454 --> 02:49:13.080]  Well, unfortunately, these people are very arrogant, and they actually think that people are still impressed with them.
[02:49:14.801 --> 02:49:16.543]  And they think they have a brand.
[02:49:17.116 --> 02:49:18.377]  How did Jeb do?
[02:49:18.497 --> 02:49:22.619]  That tells you how respected the Bush Brigade is.
[02:49:22.639 --> 02:49:24.620]  That's just among Republicans.
[02:49:25.481 --> 02:49:26.901]  Just among Republicans.
[02:49:27.582 --> 02:49:29.343]  All right, Roger Stone, best-selling author.
[02:49:29.363 --> 02:49:31.324]  We sell both his books and the Clinton Rape Shirt.
[02:49:31.524 --> 02:49:33.945]  And then FullRestore.com, key to fund this operation.
[02:49:34.225 --> 02:49:40.809]  We've done, since like 7 o'clock, that's basically three hours here, and I've done one plug today.
[02:49:41.069 --> 02:49:42.009]  The Bill Clinton Rape Shirt.
[02:49:42.029 --> 02:49:43.530]  It's only for Prison Service Limited Edition.
[02:49:43.810 --> 02:49:44.751]  We're about to stop selling it.
[02:49:45.111 --> 02:49:46.191]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:49:46.431 --> 02:49:50.333]  We have new probiotics with 50 billion live cultures in it, 23 strains.
[02:49:50.673 --> 02:49:51.753]  Nobody's got something better.
[02:49:53.334 --> 02:49:54.734]  We have a whole cold facility here.
[02:49:54.754 --> 02:49:56.154]  It ships out with a cold pack.
[02:49:56.495 --> 02:49:57.975]  That purchase supports the broadcast.
[02:49:58.315 --> 02:50:03.317]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:50:03.337 --> 02:50:06.358]  The internet is handed over at five days of the UN.
[02:50:06.638 --> 02:50:08.998]  We're not saying we'll shut it down overnight, but they're calling for censorship.
[02:50:09.338 --> 02:50:12.099]  That's my next question to you, Roger, and I'm going to give you the floor before other questions.
[02:50:12.399 --> 02:50:13.520]  The 20 minutes we have left with you.
[02:50:14.660 --> 02:50:23.642]  How does the empire strike back when, I'm not exaggerating, I look at these numbers and I pinch myself, Roger, we don't have triple the viewers and listeners now we had a year ago.
[02:50:23.742 --> 02:50:25.063]  It's six, seven times.
[02:50:25.503 --> 02:50:31.044]  We're getting, instead of six, seven million YouTube views a week, now with our affiliate channels, we're getting 20, 30, 40.
[02:50:31.244 --> 02:50:33.084]  We've had 42 million views the last week.
[02:50:35.925 --> 02:50:43.451]  Uh, I mean, on Terrestrial Radio, the ratings are, with small affiliates versus top affiliates, we're doubling Rush Limbaugh in some settings.
[02:50:43.951 --> 02:50:45.392]  The whole industry is freaking out right now.
[02:50:45.833 --> 02:50:47.494]  I mean, I quite frankly cannot believe this.
[02:50:48.135 --> 02:50:55.280]  InfoWars, right now, on an average day, has more viewers and listeners certified by ad agencies than Fox News.
[02:50:55.540 --> 02:50:56.180]  I'm not bragging.
[02:50:56.461 --> 02:50:57.121]  It's now happened.
[02:50:57.501 --> 02:50:59.843]  Paul Watson has videos daily with 5 million views.
[02:51:00.264 --> 02:51:00.584]  Okay?
[02:51:00.984 --> 02:51:03.126]  I don't, I mean, this is actually scary, to be at this level.
[02:51:04.006 --> 02:51:05.767]  This just signifies their free fall.
[02:51:06.167 --> 02:51:06.968]  What is happening?
[02:51:07.288 --> 02:51:08.028]  Where does it go?
[02:51:08.308 --> 02:51:09.569]  How does the Empire Strikes Back?
[02:51:09.849 --> 02:51:12.230]  And you've got the floor for like five minutes, whatever you want to cover.
[02:51:12.551 --> 02:51:14.652]  I've got Joe Biggs and Kit Daniels here, our reporters.
[02:51:14.872 --> 02:51:15.572]  They've got questions.
[02:51:15.852 --> 02:51:16.413]  Roger Stone.
[02:51:19.114 --> 02:51:22.716]  Well, I want to get right to Joe Biggs because he's always got great questions.
[02:51:22.776 --> 02:51:27.378]  But Alex, I flew this morning from New York back to Miami.
[02:51:28.219 --> 02:51:32.881]  And frankly, when I got to the house, I was happy to say that my brain force had arrived.
[02:51:33.385 --> 02:51:39.148]  I was able to pop a few so I had a productive day but I've been putting in 18 hour days.
[02:51:39.708 --> 02:51:41.769]  It's an exciting time to be an American.
[02:51:42.350 --> 02:51:44.311]  It's an exciting time to be alive.
[02:51:45.291 --> 02:51:53.836]  I know from what you speak because I cannot walk down the street in any city in America in which people don't say to me,
[02:51:54.588 --> 02:51:56.629]  Hey, I saw you on with Alex Jones.
[02:51:56.769 --> 02:51:58.411]  I saw you on with InfoWar.
[02:51:58.791 --> 02:51:59.811]  Stay after Hillary.
[02:51:59.912 --> 02:52:01.252]  Keep the heat on Hillary.
[02:52:01.653 --> 02:52:03.694]  I have people high-fiving me.
[02:52:03.754 --> 02:52:13.401]  By the way, a large number of African Americans high-fiving me about the truth that we expose here on InfoWars.
[02:52:14.381 --> 02:52:19.965]  They are going to try to steal this election between voter fraud and
[02:52:20.908 --> 02:52:22.549]  Election theft, i.e.
[02:52:22.649 --> 02:52:39.414]  the manipulation of the computerized machines, and they're going to try to do it in the clear by utilizing this 1982 consent decree that the Republican National Committee unwisely signed with the federal courts.
[02:52:39.454 --> 02:52:44.656]  That means they get to steal without, you know, without legitimate observers.
[02:52:45.156 --> 02:52:46.697]  This is beyond Trump's
[02:52:47.076 --> 02:52:59.427]  Personal safety, my largest single concern, because the stench of defeat is in the air for Hillary and her cronies, and you can see it in their panic.
[02:53:00.404 --> 02:53:02.105]  You can see it in her eyes.
[02:53:02.325 --> 02:53:05.085]  Roger Stone, you're on target, and you've been a pessimist all along.
[02:53:05.125 --> 02:53:09.607]  Now clearly Trump is tsunami wave dominating basically across the board.
[02:53:09.647 --> 02:53:13.508]  Hillary's giving up Ohio, or correct me if I'm wrong, they're saying she's giving up Ohio.
[02:53:14.028 --> 02:53:17.329]  And so, if they stole the nomination from Sanders, the sky's the limit.
[02:53:17.729 --> 02:53:24.091]  Is the elite crazy enough to steal it and give it to an invalid that's having convulsions every hour?
[02:53:25.832 --> 02:53:27.112]  The answer is yes.
[02:53:27.452 --> 02:53:30.213]  A war with Russia is a possibility.
[02:53:30.808 --> 02:53:39.719]  I disagree with those who say that Obama will look for an excuse to declare martial law and postpone the elections.
[02:53:40.319 --> 02:53:44.925]  The globalists will only do what they think they can get away with.
[02:53:45.578 --> 02:53:50.541]  They know there are too many right-thinking Americans who are armed... No, that's right.
[02:53:50.821 --> 02:53:51.621]  Obama's a puppet.
[02:53:51.641 --> 02:53:54.462]  They'll have a coup in stealing the election.
[02:53:54.723 --> 02:53:54.943]  Right.
[02:53:55.083 --> 02:53:59.825]  Martial law will not work because too many people in this country have Second Amendment rights.
[02:53:59.845 --> 02:53:59.985]  I agree.
[02:54:00.005 --> 02:54:01.506]  But they won't call it martial law.
[02:54:01.806 --> 02:54:04.267]  They'll fund race riots, though, and call it civil emergency.
[02:54:04.548 --> 02:54:06.108]  Not to keep him in, but as a distraction.
[02:54:06.308 --> 02:54:12.291]  I mean, what is all the Soros and Ford Foundation tripling down with hundreds of millions the last three weeks for race riots?
[02:54:12.331 --> 02:54:13.192]  What's behind that, then?
[02:54:14.855 --> 02:54:24.302]  I think they're going to try to have violence in our inner cities and somehow find a way, as they have previously, to try to blame Trump.
[02:54:24.742 --> 02:54:28.424]  The bad news is, I think the American people will see through it.
[02:54:31.094 --> 02:54:36.577]  It is the end for the globalists, and they know it, and they are nothing short of hysterical.
[02:54:37.037 --> 02:54:37.858]  There's your headline.
[02:54:37.938 --> 02:54:40.059]  It's the end of the globalists as we know them.
[02:54:40.479 --> 02:54:41.439]  The people see through it.
[02:54:41.820 --> 02:54:45.201]  So, other things on your boiler here in the 15 minutes we have left.
[02:54:45.221 --> 02:54:46.962]  I'm going to get the crew to pop in with questions.
[02:54:47.583 --> 02:54:49.864]  Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com.
[02:54:50.364 --> 02:54:53.406]  What other curveballs should we be looking for?
[02:54:53.426 --> 02:54:54.326]  What other issues?
[02:54:55.847 --> 02:54:59.629]  Well, first of all, there's now a premium on the next two debates.
[02:55:00.646 --> 02:55:07.330]  A big piece in the New York Times today saying that Trump won't show up for the second interview.
[02:55:07.350 --> 02:55:08.170]  He's made up, right?
[02:55:08.210 --> 02:55:08.570]  Wrong.
[02:55:09.171 --> 02:55:09.531]  Wrong.
[02:55:10.391 --> 02:55:18.055]  A front page story saying that Hillary is a great advocate for the black people, but Trump stands only for white people.
[02:55:18.876 --> 02:55:23.618]  Maybe Alex Burns and Patrick Healy of the New York Times should refresh themselves on the 1999
[02:55:25.478 --> 02:55:41.330]  Crime bill which incarcerated an entire generation of young black men for the non-violent crime of possession of small amounts of drugs and had harsher penalties for crack cocaine than powder.
[02:55:41.410 --> 02:55:45.433]  And by the way, you've been an advocate for decriminalization for 20 years.
[02:55:45.473 --> 02:55:47.635]  You have a lot of credibility when you talk about this.
[02:55:48.749 --> 02:55:54.853]  Well, look, the Clintons have played more than their share of dog whistle politics.
[02:55:55.654 --> 02:55:58.496]  And Trump didn't quite nail the point tonight.
[02:55:58.816 --> 02:55:59.196]  I agree.
[02:55:59.216 --> 02:56:00.537]  She's a total race pimp.
[02:56:00.577 --> 02:56:03.019]  That was her biggest thing, calling him racist?
[02:56:03.299 --> 02:56:08.803]  This is the KKK Grand Wizard's knighted little princess that said black people are basically animals?
[02:56:09.063 --> 02:56:10.384]  This woman's a goddamn joke.
[02:56:10.444 --> 02:56:11.085]  Excuse me, God.
[02:56:12.014 --> 02:56:13.395]  Well, it's even worse than that.
[02:56:14.476 --> 02:56:28.407]  She has destroyed black families, and more importantly, her economic policies, those of Obama and those of her husband, are abysmal.
[02:56:28.687 --> 02:56:32.150]  Black job creation during their years in office.
[02:56:32.190 --> 02:56:32.950]  Let me ask you that.
[02:56:32.990 --> 02:56:35.272]  Why did black Americans get hit worse than anybody?
[02:56:35.512 --> 02:56:36.733]  Why do they double black on employment?
[02:56:36.753 --> 02:56:37.954]  They seem like they're out to get them.
[02:56:38.474 --> 02:56:41.557]  Why, if somebody is your own constituent, why screw them?
[02:56:43.151 --> 02:56:44.751]  Well, because it's a plantation.
[02:56:45.371 --> 02:56:48.852]  You know, tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect.
[02:56:49.432 --> 02:56:53.773]  I feel bad for African Americans who have given the Democrats their votes.
[02:56:54.133 --> 02:56:55.633]  There are no jobs.
[02:56:55.773 --> 02:57:10.336]  As you know, Alex, the job creation statistics in that community are so bad that they have to subtract those people who have stopped looking for work to try to dress them up and look better, and they still stink.
[02:57:10.876 --> 02:57:11.296]  They're still
[02:57:12.122 --> 02:57:13.183]  A national disgrace.
[02:57:13.643 --> 02:57:18.985]  Donald Trump will create jobs, as he has in his entire life, for black people.
[02:57:19.005 --> 02:57:21.126]  I want to hear Joe Biggs' question.
[02:57:21.166 --> 02:57:21.366]  Let's go.
[02:57:21.386 --> 02:57:21.666]  That's right.
[02:57:21.686 --> 02:57:24.568]  Joe Biggs, hit Daniel's pop-up with your questions for Roger Stone.
[02:57:24.588 --> 02:57:30.130]  I mean, I just got in from Charlotte a few hours ago, you know, where the riot- I saw you pulled in right when the show started three hours ago.
[02:57:30.150 --> 02:57:30.610]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:57:30.790 --> 02:57:35.232]  And, you know, I didn't meet one person out there who liked Hillary Clinton.
[02:57:35.793 --> 02:57:36.453]  Not one of them.
[02:57:36.793 --> 02:57:38.134]  People you wouldn't even think
[02:57:38.934 --> 02:57:39.755]  They would like Trump.
[02:57:39.775 --> 02:57:42.377]  We're out there like, vote Trump, vote Trump, vote Trump.
[02:57:42.798 --> 02:57:49.925]  We sent our reporter in Cleveland in, Millie Weaver, and the Democrats go, we can't find anybody undercover who support Trump.
[02:57:50.045 --> 02:57:50.525]  It's crazy.
[02:57:50.806 --> 02:57:52.788]  All the Democrats we know, they're on video undercover.
[02:57:53.308 --> 02:57:54.189]  They're like Veritas.
[02:57:54.249 --> 02:57:55.750]  They say no one supports her.
[02:57:56.511 --> 02:57:56.811]  Go ahead.
[02:57:57.311 --> 02:57:58.952]  Yeah, I mean, I couldn't find anybody.
[02:57:58.992 --> 02:58:02.454]  I wore my Hillary for Prison shirt one day, and they were just, like, clapping.
[02:58:02.994 --> 02:58:08.816]  Like, Hillary is going to continue this whole, what we're living through every day.
[02:58:08.916 --> 02:58:12.498]  Everything that we go through in the inner city is going to continue if she becomes president.
[02:58:12.518 --> 02:58:14.459]  I want you to come back with this, but what about the polls?
[02:58:14.539 --> 02:58:18.801]  I know we want to be quote scientific, but they admit they're push polls, fake numbers, more Democrats sampled.
[02:58:19.141 --> 02:58:24.643]  We can't find Democrats to support her unless they're super rich, white, elite areas in Austin or other areas.
[02:58:24.683 --> 02:58:25.884]  I mean, I'm serious, Roger.
[02:58:26.204 --> 02:58:30.605]  I don't see how it isn't a giant landslide for Trump because we can't find these people.
[02:58:32.186 --> 02:58:50.111]  I'd like to see the launch of this poll mole program that Dr. Richard Davis is developing where you would have a multi-million dollar national sample and therefore the margin of error would be infinitesimal, less than a point.
[02:58:50.951 --> 02:58:55.392]  That's how we keep the pollsters honest because as you know, Alex,
[02:58:56.494 --> 02:59:07.899]  The precursor to stealing the election is to create this phony expectation level by inflating the number of Democrats in the national polls.
[02:59:08.399 --> 02:59:12.861]  There is an intensity gap here between Hillary and Donald Trump.
[02:59:12.921 --> 02:59:14.762]  I can't find anybody who's for her!
[02:59:21.943 --> 02:59:29.366]  The point, the fact remains that Hillary has the worst poll numbers among African Americans since John F. Kennedy in 1960.
[02:59:29.426 --> 02:59:31.487]  She's, I don't even think she's going to hit 75.
[02:59:31.807 --> 02:59:33.668]  Only got like 25% of black males, 16% of females.
[02:59:35.834 --> 02:59:43.780]  On average, a Democratic candidate for the president, win or lose, gets at least 87% of African American voters.
[02:59:44.600 --> 02:59:58.150]  So my question to you is, will the Democrats, it seems like they're going to keep trying to push Hillary into office, but they're going to destroy themselves, kind of like how the Republican Party almost destroyed themselves by trying to put Jeb Bush in
[02:59:58.590 --> 02:59:59.571]  Sure, the arrogance.
[02:59:59.591 --> 03:00:02.212]  I mean, what about record numbers of Hispanic males saying they're going for Trump?
[03:00:02.552 --> 03:00:04.793]  What record numbers of black males going for Trump?
[03:00:05.034 --> 03:00:06.534]  What is this bellwether, Roger Stone?
[03:00:07.935 --> 03:00:09.876]  There's definitely something going on there.
[03:00:10.016 --> 03:00:26.225]  Now, in all honesty, Trump could greatly improve his standing with black voters if he would talk more about his economic program, because the black people I know want a piece of the American pie.
[03:00:26.718 --> 03:00:29.319]  They want economic prosperity.
[03:00:29.840 --> 03:00:34.162]  The Clinton-Obama policies have devastated their communities.
[03:00:34.342 --> 03:00:40.866]  They have no upward mobility, they have terrible schools, no job training, and no job opportunities.
[03:00:41.386 --> 03:00:43.567]  Trump is the candidate of growth.
[03:00:44.147 --> 03:00:46.689]  He says, vote for me, you have nothing to lose.
[03:00:46.829 --> 03:00:50.391]  I would say, vote for Trump, you have everything to gain.
[03:00:51.158 --> 03:00:52.940]  We've tried it their way.
[03:00:53.520 --> 03:01:00.786]  Those who are trained to govern, the Harvard, Yale experts, have been running the country for 30 years.
[03:01:04.187 --> 03:01:07.130]  October surprises, our surprises, their surprises.
[03:01:07.690 --> 03:01:09.832]  Clearly populism is rising worldwide, Roger.
[03:01:09.852 --> 03:01:10.873]  Jump at any time, gentlemen.
[03:01:12.154 --> 03:01:12.954]  What could they pull?
[03:01:12.994 --> 03:01:13.795]  A war with Russia?
[03:01:13.835 --> 03:01:14.796]  An economic collapse?
[03:01:15.196 --> 03:01:19.180]  CNN had this op-ed guy going, don't worry, something big's coming.
[03:01:19.480 --> 03:01:20.501]  Trump's going to be in trouble.
[03:01:20.881 --> 03:01:22.843]  Some big crisis he can't control.
[03:01:22.863 --> 03:01:30.149]  So, if you're in the little beady-eyed brains of Hillary and, you know, Obama and the globalists, what do you do, Roger Stone?
[03:01:30.169 --> 03:01:31.270]  And I want to get your takes on that.
[03:01:32.843 --> 03:01:53.410]  A reporter at the New York Post has warned me that the Clintons are going to try to smear Donald Trump, claiming that it is he who had a relationship with the convicted pedophile Clinton Foundation donor Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:01:53.570 --> 03:02:00.753]  There's no question that Mr. Trump knows Epstein because Epstein was a member of his private club.
[03:02:02.458 --> 03:02:09.841]  As Trump said tonight, open to any individual who has the money to join.
[03:02:10.201 --> 03:02:15.263]  Jews, blacks, Hispanics, unlike the other clubs in Palm Beach which are restricted.
[03:02:15.663 --> 03:02:20.584]  Trump has no relationship with Epstein beyond the casual.
[03:02:20.985 --> 03:02:21.905]  It's Bill Clinton.
[03:02:22.401 --> 03:02:26.182]  Who visited Epstein's hedonistic private island.
[03:02:26.202 --> 03:02:32.665]  So you're saying, get ready, they're going to tie him to the pedophile plane that Clinton flew on all these scores of times that Trump didn't.
[03:02:33.965 --> 03:02:35.245]  They're definitely going to try.
[03:02:35.305 --> 03:02:42.548]  It's coming, I'm predicting it right here, and it will backfire because it's Bill Clinton who has a vulnerability there, not Trump.
[03:02:42.588 --> 03:02:43.548]  What else we got to look for?
[03:02:44.689 --> 03:02:47.230]  Well, we've talked about the stealing of the election.
[03:02:47.350 --> 03:02:48.270]  Fortunately, Alex,
[03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:52.601]  We have some October surprises of our own.
[03:02:53.501 --> 03:02:54.102]  Stay tuned.
[03:02:54.662 --> 03:02:55.642]  What about WikiLeaks?
[03:02:55.682 --> 03:03:02.905]  He said like three weeks ago, the next week, then he said before the debate, what the hell is going on with Julian Assange who I admire?
[03:03:02.945 --> 03:03:04.465]  But I mean, give us the data.
[03:03:04.485 --> 03:03:04.945]  Do it now.
[03:03:06.146 --> 03:03:11.828]  Well, I think that he has been distracted by these trumped up charges against him of
[03:03:13.559 --> 03:03:19.462]  Sexual harassment that he assaulted some woman to now going to the Swedish Supreme Court.
[03:03:20.202 --> 03:03:23.863]  This is a globalist attempt to silence him.
[03:03:24.004 --> 03:03:24.764]  That's what I thought.
[03:03:24.804 --> 03:03:26.224]  They got a bunch of fake charges.
[03:03:26.264 --> 03:03:27.645]  So he's tied up with that.
[03:03:28.706 --> 03:03:34.328]  He is tied up with that, but a very good friend of mine is on his way to London.
[03:03:35.023 --> 03:03:40.307]  Even as we speak, to talk to him, I will get a report shortly.
[03:03:40.327 --> 03:03:53.876]  I think Julian Assange is a freedom fighter, that he is a truth teller, and the idea that he is working for the Russians is as absurd as the idea put forward by our
[03:03:54.756 --> 03:04:04.838]  No, Rahm Emanuel may hack our elections, but there is no evidence.
[03:04:05.158 --> 03:04:09.299]  We've only got about 6 minutes left with you, then we're going to bring in Leon McAdoo and some of the other crew to comment.
[03:04:09.759 --> 03:04:11.460]  Roger Jones, our guest on Alex Jones.
[03:04:11.480 --> 03:04:13.520]  This is post-game coverage.
[03:04:13.860 --> 03:04:17.541]  Where they went over, the debate was 97 minutes long.
[03:04:18.601 --> 03:04:20.562]  They started three minutes late, but they went ten minutes over.
[03:04:21.102 --> 03:04:22.103]  So, amazing.
[03:04:22.203 --> 03:04:23.324]  Joe Biggs, quick question.
[03:04:24.144 --> 03:04:24.904]  Any other comments?
[03:04:25.004 --> 03:04:30.667]  Also, I want to bring David Knight in here in a minute, but both of you, including Daniels, other questions or comments for Roger Stone?
[03:04:31.368 --> 03:04:34.890]  Well, I think one of the interesting things was there was quite a few mic drop moments
[03:04:35.410 --> 03:04:40.011]  Where Donald Trump came out and said, you know what, you call the TPP a gold standard.
[03:04:40.031 --> 03:04:41.511]  Then she goes, no, I never said that.
[03:04:42.032 --> 03:04:42.912]  We got her saying it!
[03:04:43.292 --> 03:04:44.472]  I've got 11 instances.
[03:04:44.532 --> 03:04:45.852]  I did a video, a report.
[03:04:45.892 --> 03:04:47.193]  On InfoWars.com.
[03:04:47.213 --> 03:04:47.513]  11 instances.
[03:04:47.533 --> 03:04:48.833]  Hillary caught lying about TPP.
[03:04:48.853 --> 03:04:49.293]  Exactly.
[03:04:49.713 --> 03:04:52.134]  And that's something she did, just like she did about the emails.
[03:04:52.174 --> 03:04:54.555]  She lied about the emails right there on stage again.
[03:04:55.115 --> 03:04:57.035]  And Donald Trump jumped on that.
[03:04:57.375 --> 03:05:00.396]  The only thing I wish I would have seen a little bit more was more of attacks on there.
[03:05:00.816 --> 03:05:04.477]  You know, it was kind of soft when he said the whole super predator thing.
[03:05:05.097 --> 03:05:11.080]  I thought he could have been a little bit more aggressive, brought the fact that Bill Clinton, you know, had put a lot of these people in jail.
[03:05:12.141 --> 03:05:13.141]  I want to see more attacks.
[03:05:13.161 --> 03:05:14.082]  That's what the people want.
[03:05:14.102 --> 03:05:15.463]  People want to see him be aggressive.
[03:05:15.503 --> 03:05:16.944]  Yeah, we're sick of these globalists.
[03:05:16.984 --> 03:05:21.286]  We want to see him go after- I want to see him attack them head-on at full speed.
[03:05:21.306 --> 03:05:24.848]  And people say, well, that'll make her constituents that are on the fence think he's mean.
[03:05:24.928 --> 03:05:25.128]  No.
[03:05:25.508 --> 03:05:27.429]  We're not trying to conform to their little system.
[03:05:27.609 --> 03:05:28.990]  We want to break the paradigm.
[03:05:29.170 --> 03:05:30.351]  We want to shatter the paradigm.
[03:05:30.591 --> 03:05:31.972]  Are we wrong, Roger Stone?
[03:05:32.967 --> 03:05:37.429]  Uh, you know, in all honesty, I think it's better to use the stiletto.
[03:05:38.369 --> 03:05:40.090]  Just lovingly stab the knife in.
[03:05:40.110 --> 03:05:40.790]  She is a woman.
[03:05:41.951 --> 03:05:48.734]  It's, it's, uh, there is a problem with looking duly harsh in attacking a woman.
[03:05:49.298 --> 03:05:52.419]  Despite the fact that she so richly deserves it.
[03:05:53.580 --> 03:06:01.083]  Notice that in this debate, he never pointed out that she has a fundamental problem with the truth.
[03:06:01.143 --> 03:06:02.463]  That's my next question.
[03:06:02.483 --> 03:06:08.425]  Do you know, or can you guess, what was it Trump said that I was going to say it but I won't say it to be nice to you?
[03:06:08.746 --> 03:06:09.746]  What was it he held back?
[03:06:11.001 --> 03:06:13.546]  He was going to call her a liar because that's what she is.
[03:06:13.626 --> 03:06:17.834]  As the late Bill Sapphire said in the New York Times, she's a congenital liar.
[03:06:17.954 --> 03:06:23.204]  But Alex, it is just the first of three debates.
[03:06:24.291 --> 03:06:30.756]  And I suspect Trump not only had a win tonight, in my view, but I think he will triumph in the last two debates.
[03:06:30.816 --> 03:06:33.978]  No, I give him a 95.
[03:06:34.178 --> 03:06:36.820]  You're going to get your wish before this is over.
[03:06:37.820 --> 03:06:40.042]  Roger, you're talking about October surprises.
[03:06:40.382 --> 03:06:47.106]  It seems like to me, every single attack the Klens go after Trump with, they rely on the mainstream media's influence.
[03:06:47.146 --> 03:06:50.569]  But as we all know... Oh, yes, you kept saying, oh, my fact-checkers at the Washington Post.
[03:06:51.069 --> 03:06:52.530]  They'll wipe my ass tonight!
[03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:57.712]  But the fact remains of mainstream media is that public trust in the mainstream media is at an all-time low.
[03:06:57.752 --> 03:06:59.232]  They do not have influence anymore.
[03:06:59.292 --> 03:07:02.233]  So is it just pure arrogance by the globalists, or what is the deal?
[03:07:02.273 --> 03:07:08.936]  Because every single play they have, they're playing right now in their playbook, relies on media influence, but the media doesn't have the influence.
[03:07:08.956 --> 03:07:10.417]  Exactly, that's why they're arrogant.
[03:07:11.397 --> 03:07:13.338]  They are living in the past.
[03:07:14.118 --> 03:07:19.140]  Their formative political experience is in the 80s, when we only had
[03:07:19.991 --> 03:07:21.532]  That's why they're going after the internet.
[03:07:45.205 --> 03:07:46.407]  Right, exactly.
[03:07:46.467 --> 03:07:57.964]  Thanks to InfoWars, thanks to Breitbart, thanks to the Daily Caller, thanks to Town Hall, thanks to all these conservative alternative media outlets, you can no longer choke the truth.
[03:07:58.004 --> 03:08:00.187]  You can no longer hide facts.
[03:08:00.347 --> 03:08:05.830]  I just don't think there's any way that she can win straight up in a fair fight.
[03:08:06.190 --> 03:08:16.915]  When I was in Charlotte, I was speaking with National Guard, and I can't talk to them on camera, they won't do it, but I mean, off camera, I'm talking to these guys, and they're like, man, we love Trump, Hillary's gonna get us killed.
[03:08:17.395 --> 03:08:18.296]  Same thing with the police.
[03:08:18.376 --> 03:08:22.598]  I talked to the riot police out there, local law enforcement, state troopers, all that.
[03:08:23.038 --> 03:08:25.560]  They cannot stand Hillary Clinton.
[03:08:25.860 --> 03:08:27.481]  How does she have a chance in hell?
[03:08:27.961 --> 03:08:28.442]  At all?
[03:08:28.622 --> 03:08:29.002]  Fairly?
[03:08:29.042 --> 03:08:30.523]  She can't get crowds.
[03:08:30.603 --> 03:08:31.764]  It's all a hoax.
[03:08:31.904 --> 03:08:33.825]  And nationalism is rising.
[03:08:33.885 --> 03:08:39.534]  And she sits there and she's so cocky and she, the whole time she's sitting there with a little smirk on her face and she's lying though!
[03:08:39.654 --> 03:08:40.836]  The con game isn't going to work.
[03:08:40.856 --> 03:08:42.398]  We've got to let him go in about three minutes.
[03:08:42.679 --> 03:08:46.485]  Let's bring David Knight in for a final question and comment for Roger Stone.
[03:08:46.525 --> 03:08:47.606]  David Knight from the Other Studio.
[03:08:48.559 --> 03:08:55.064]  Yeah, my comment is, I'm sitting here watching the debate, and I noticed that Hillary Clinton appeared to disappear immediately.
[03:08:56.005 --> 03:08:58.747]  Donald Trump stayed on the floor and talked to people for at least 20 minutes.
[03:08:58.807 --> 03:08:59.487]  He's still there?
[03:08:59.507 --> 03:09:00.348]  Yeah, he's still out there.
[03:09:00.688 --> 03:09:02.610]  But Hillary Clinton left right away.
[03:09:02.950 --> 03:09:04.431]  Now, she was able to go the distance.
[03:09:04.791 --> 03:09:09.955]  I didn't notice her eyes diverging at any point, but I noticed that she was very careful to always look to her left.
[03:09:10.936 --> 03:09:15.378]  It seemed like when she had these problems with the eye divergence, that she was always looking to the right.
[03:09:15.858 --> 03:09:20.980]  And when she would turn to the right, she would turn her whole body to address Donald Trump.
[03:09:21.020 --> 03:09:21.980]  So, it's interesting.
[03:09:22.020 --> 03:09:22.681]  She made it through.
[03:09:22.741 --> 03:09:24.721]  She didn't get into a coughing fit.
[03:09:24.741 --> 03:09:25.522]  She didn't collapse.
[03:09:26.222 --> 03:09:28.983]  But she did leave immediately after... Oh, hear that?
[03:09:29.063 --> 03:09:29.723]  She's alive.
[03:09:29.763 --> 03:09:30.323]  She can walk.
[03:09:30.744 --> 03:09:32.604]  It's alive!
[03:09:33.085 --> 03:09:34.785]  That's a big win that she didn't fall down.
[03:09:34.845 --> 03:09:36.426]  How's that for a low bar?
[03:09:38.018 --> 03:09:41.703]  Well, David Knight, the best dressed man in all of Austin, Texas.
[03:09:41.803 --> 03:09:42.965]  I think you hit it right on the head.
[03:09:43.185 --> 03:09:44.026]  Of course she left.
[03:09:44.066 --> 03:09:48.472]  They had to get her on an oxygen tank off stage as soon as they could.
[03:09:49.167 --> 03:09:49.347]  Yeah.
[03:09:49.607 --> 03:09:51.349]  Roger, what do you make of the Secret Service?
[03:09:51.389 --> 03:09:52.810]  You were there for part of this.
[03:09:52.870 --> 03:09:54.991]  We're going to get you big info about her health.
[03:09:55.652 --> 03:09:58.534]  Five weeks ago at Cleveland, three weeks later they gave it to us.
[03:09:58.554 --> 03:09:59.615]  They said she's falling down.
[03:09:59.635 --> 03:10:00.555]  We got it on video.
[03:10:01.336 --> 03:10:02.757]  I mean, what do you make of that?
[03:10:02.777 --> 03:10:04.698]  Do you have any intel on what's wrong with her?
[03:10:04.718 --> 03:10:06.159]  Because Secret Service doesn't know.
[03:10:06.179 --> 03:10:08.541]  They just said she has convulsions all the time.
[03:10:09.041 --> 03:10:11.043]  Any word on what's going on with Hillary?
[03:10:12.225 --> 03:10:25.009]  I spoke to a Secret Service agent today by phone who does not want to be identified, who tells me that he is virtually certain that she has some advanced form of epilepsy.
[03:10:25.789 --> 03:10:32.111]  I don't know, I'm not a medical doctor, but I am intelligent enough to know she's not well.
[03:10:32.611 --> 03:10:33.872]  And Trump is exactly right.
[03:10:34.312 --> 03:10:41.634]  She lacks the stamina or the mental acuity or the balance to be President of the United States.
[03:10:43.999 --> 03:10:45.400]  All right, well, thank you.
[03:10:45.520 --> 03:10:46.881]  Obviously, there's a quickening.
[03:10:46.921 --> 03:10:50.643]  We've got 41 days left now in some time zones before the election.
[03:10:51.283 --> 03:10:53.284]  Roger Stone, StoneColdTruths.com.
[03:10:53.324 --> 03:10:55.666]  Both your books sold at Infowars.com.
[03:10:55.686 --> 03:11:00.849]  And of course, the Clinton Rape Shirt helps support all we're doing and boldly exposes the criminals we're facing.
[03:11:01.309 --> 03:11:02.970]  But overall, a huge win for Trump.
[03:11:03.470 --> 03:11:07.373]  And I think even the establishment said, well, if he was, if he was presidential, that'd be a win.
[03:11:07.393 --> 03:11:08.714]  I think it happened.
[03:11:08.734 --> 03:11:11.076]  I was very sad for Lester Holder, who claims he's a Republican.
[03:11:11.677 --> 03:11:12.197]  I like the guy.
[03:11:12.217 --> 03:11:12.818]  He's a good reporter.
[03:11:12.838 --> 03:11:14.699]  But man, he, Stone's right.
[03:11:14.719 --> 03:11:17.442]  He really did go after Trump four or five times.
[03:11:17.482 --> 03:11:18.483]  He didn't after Hillary.
[03:11:18.923 --> 03:11:21.045]  I think that's going to backfire on them.
[03:11:21.325 --> 03:11:21.965]  Closing comment.
[03:11:21.985 --> 03:11:24.367]  Do you think that'll blow up in their face, Roger Stone?
[03:11:25.448 --> 03:11:29.792]  I think it's going to put the next moderators in a very tough position.
[03:11:30.336 --> 03:11:39.564]  Alex, let me also mention my new show, The Stone Cold Truth, on the Genesis Communications Network radio every Saturday to 1 for 3.
[03:11:40.044 --> 03:11:48.651]  I've followed your advice and I'm very pleased to be doing the shows now and I hope some folks from InfoWars will tune in this coming Saturday.
[03:11:48.691 --> 03:11:49.111]  Absolutely.
[03:11:49.151 --> 03:11:56.497]  We're going to put links up to it and tell our affiliates, send an email out, tell our 170, 180 plus affiliates, try to pick that broadcast up.
[03:11:56.757 --> 03:11:57.878]  Thank you so much, Roger Stone.
[03:11:57.898 --> 03:11:58.539]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:11:59.306 --> 03:12:01.647]  Alex, God bless you and God bless America.
[03:12:02.127 --> 03:12:02.747]  Absolutely.
[03:12:03.508 --> 03:12:08.050]  I want to give David and all of you, and not that I need a break, but I'm going to take five minutes because I won't shut up.
[03:12:08.090 --> 03:12:08.930]  That's just my nature.
[03:12:09.470 --> 03:12:12.992]  I'm kind of an alpha male, unfortunately, in a world of alpha males.
[03:12:13.892 --> 03:12:16.193]  I want to give you, David, not a few minutes, you a few minutes.
[03:12:16.413 --> 03:12:25.397]  Then I want to play this clip of one of our reporters, Ashley Beckford, really being discriminated against by thumbing at the mouth racist liberals.
[03:12:26.037 --> 03:12:27.178]  Uh, who really are the biggest bullies.
[03:12:27.198 --> 03:12:32.101]  They say they own black people or anybody else for that matter, but the way they own black people just like they belong to them.
[03:12:32.161 --> 03:12:32.942]  It's really sick.
[03:12:32.962 --> 03:12:36.384]  Uh, and, uh, we've got that clip coming up.
[03:12:36.404 --> 03:12:40.467]  I want to bring Liam McAdoo and others in to, to, to obviously cover the unfolding situation.
[03:12:40.487 --> 03:12:43.309]  But David and I spent a few minutes here and you guys take over for about five minutes.
[03:12:45.031 --> 03:12:46.012]  David, you got any points to make?
[03:12:46.672 --> 03:12:50.394]  Yes, Alex, you know, you're talking about Ashley and the attacks against her.
[03:12:50.414 --> 03:12:55.356]  One of the things that came out today on the Hill, Harry Reid said to the media, you need to call Donald Trump a racist.
[03:12:55.757 --> 03:13:01.219]  He says, there's always one word that many of the press conspicuously avoid, and that's racist.
[03:13:01.239 --> 03:13:03.521]  They never label Trump a racist, but he is a racist.
[03:13:03.541 --> 03:13:08.483]  Can you believe that Harry Reid would say that when all we hear is racist, racist, racist?
[03:13:09.103 --> 03:13:10.444]  And he says, you're not using it enough.
[03:13:10.784 --> 03:13:13.966]  That's the only thing they have, Alex, is that race card.
[03:13:14.426 --> 03:13:20.613]  And even to talk about how the Democrats have failed the black community, that's racist to talk about that.
[03:13:20.993 --> 03:13:32.906]  To go to Detroit and to show how the Democrats have ground that into the ground, both by the export of factories abroad, as well as their failed social policies in that area, to point out
[03:13:33.326 --> 03:13:36.327]  How they're being failed by these Democrats, that is racist.
[03:13:36.767 --> 03:13:45.490]  I thought it was interesting, and I'm not sure if somebody else did a report on this, a fact check on this, but I heard Hillary say that she would cut regulations.
[03:13:46.251 --> 03:13:48.471]  I just about fell out of my chair when I saw that.
[03:13:48.871 --> 03:13:49.672]  Cut regulations?
[03:13:49.692 --> 03:13:51.032]  You mean like with the EPA?
[03:13:51.372 --> 03:13:52.093]  Or the IRS?
[03:13:52.373 --> 03:13:55.234]  Or you mean all the mandates that you continue to pile on top?
[03:13:55.334 --> 03:13:58.955]  Give us one example, please Hillary, of one regulation.
[03:13:59.335 --> 03:14:04.458]  Well, David, she would cut regulations when it comes to State Department classified emails.
[03:14:05.719 --> 03:14:07.279]  That's a regulation she'd cut.
[03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:08.660]  She cut a lot of those.
[03:14:08.680 --> 03:14:12.102]  She just cut it right off the top of the email, didn't she?
[03:14:12.362 --> 03:14:12.862]  Exactly.
[03:14:13.043 --> 03:14:13.823]  The classification.
[03:14:14.003 --> 03:14:16.705]  One point I want to make about the whole Harry Reid thing.
[03:14:16.925 --> 03:14:18.526]  Here's liberalism in a nutshell.
[03:14:19.306 --> 03:14:21.127]  They have to stick with the narrative.
[03:14:21.408 --> 03:14:25.530]  If the narrative runs contrary to reality, they have to disavow reality.
[03:14:26.151 --> 03:14:37.338]  So yeah, of course, you're going to see white liberals that are going to attack a black Trump supporter because the black Trump supporter doesn't stick to their narrative where all blacks must be Democrats.
[03:14:39.780 --> 03:14:41.902]  They have to push this whole identity politics.
[03:14:42.762 --> 03:14:48.846]  Even despite the fact that Americans are waking up to the fact that identity politics is not reality.
[03:14:49.546 --> 03:14:50.747]  And it's never been reality.
[03:14:51.741 --> 03:14:55.424]  Well, I think it's also interesting, too, when you look at the taxes.
[03:14:55.744 --> 03:15:00.207]  Donald Trump has proposed the largest tax cut any president has ever proposed.
[03:15:00.287 --> 03:15:02.328]  Larger than what Ronald Reagan did.
[03:15:02.348 --> 03:15:04.249]  And we know that that worked very effectively.
[03:15:04.390 --> 03:15:12.775]  And yet, she's still trying to use the same tired criticisms to say, well, it is simply top-down, it's trickle-down, and so forth and so on.
[03:15:13.115 --> 03:15:13.696]  It really worked.
[03:15:14.256 --> 03:15:17.838]  It raised all the boats, as JFK pointed out.
[03:15:17.878 --> 03:15:19.740]  And JFK was the first one to do the tax cuts.
[03:15:20.140 --> 03:15:21.541]  His were much smaller than Reagan's.
[03:15:21.921 --> 03:15:24.523]  Reagan's were much smaller than what Donald Trump has proposed.
[03:15:25.083 --> 03:15:29.806]  And yet, what she is saying, essentially, is that she wants to have top-down taxation.
[03:15:30.206 --> 03:15:31.908]  She wants to have trickle-down taxation.
[03:15:32.208 --> 03:15:36.831]  She wants to increase taxes at the top, increase mandates on all businesses across the board.
[03:15:36.851 --> 03:15:39.993]  Because the elites are able to exempt themselves and shut down their competition, absolutely.
[03:15:40.393 --> 03:15:41.695]  I want all of us to have a free-for-all here.
[03:15:41.715 --> 03:15:43.798]  We should bring in Leon McAdoo here in a moment.
[03:15:43.818 --> 03:15:49.265]  But first, we haven't done a commercial break in 3 hours and 17 minutes.
[03:15:49.425 --> 03:15:50.687]  I've barely plugged anything.
[03:15:50.727 --> 03:15:53.250]  You can see this is all very expensive, folks, to fund this.
[03:15:53.290 --> 03:15:56.334]  Other news agencies are making hundreds of millions of dollars in the last week.
[03:15:56.795 --> 03:15:57.975]  You know, millions run to us.
[03:15:57.995 --> 03:15:58.996]  Taxpayer funded, you know?
[03:15:59.196 --> 03:15:59.856]  Taxpayer funded.
[03:15:59.916 --> 03:16:02.777]  I mean, this place costs over $25 million a year to run.
[03:16:02.797 --> 03:16:04.838]  That's cheap compared to other media outlets.
[03:16:04.858 --> 03:16:07.839]  Just the bandwidth alone is going to be probably $50,000 tonight.
[03:16:08.239 --> 03:16:08.899]  Always free feeds.
[03:16:08.939 --> 03:16:10.940]  We have new probiotics available.
[03:16:12.093 --> 03:16:14.256]  That is the highest quality for the best labs in the country.
[03:16:14.916 --> 03:16:17.359]  It's Biome Defense, 50 billion live and active cultures.
[03:16:17.760 --> 03:16:18.861]  New Info, original live product.
[03:16:18.881 --> 03:16:21.824]  We send it to you with cold packs so it retains its highest level.
[03:16:22.565 --> 03:16:25.809]  You can actually save it and put it on the shelf and a lot of it lives, but it's good to keep it cold.
[03:16:26.209 --> 03:16:27.231]  Supports healthy flora.
[03:16:27.851 --> 03:16:30.313]  23 probiotics trained, 60 capsules.
[03:16:30.773 --> 03:16:32.534]  That's at Infowarslife.com.

[03:16:47.422 --> 03:16:51.064]  And if you are a long-time listener, I want to thank you for what you've done.
[03:16:51.144 --> 03:16:52.645]  We couldn't do any of this without you.
[03:16:53.345 --> 03:16:54.966]  This is a media operation you built.
[03:16:55.626 --> 03:17:05.953]  So whether you buy the Hillary for Prison t-shirt, whether you buy non-GMO heirloom seeds, or a shortwave radio, or a solar panel system from InfoWarsTore.com, you are financing this.
[03:17:05.993 --> 03:17:10.575]  This is an example of creating the economy and the culture you want by your decisions.
[03:17:10.976 --> 03:17:12.957]  This is what they want to shut down, the free market.
[03:17:13.337 --> 03:17:19.141]  A true, open, liberal, democratic society where we vote with our ideas and our purchases.
[03:17:19.541 --> 03:17:22.282]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsTore.com,
[03:17:23.183 --> 03:17:23.703]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[03:17:23.963 --> 03:17:27.865]  That Hillary for Prison t-shirt was a huge hit in Charlotte.
[03:17:28.265 --> 03:17:32.306]  I'm telling you, people were calling me the Hillary for Prison guy by, like, day two.
[03:17:32.326 --> 03:17:33.947]  And I didn't even have to have the shirt on.
[03:17:33.987 --> 03:17:36.008]  Like, hey, are you the guy that was wearing that Hillary for Prison shirt?
[03:17:36.028 --> 03:17:36.848]  Where do I go get that at?
[03:17:37.168 --> 03:17:37.588]  I want one.
[03:17:37.628 --> 03:17:38.008]  I need one.
[03:17:38.028 --> 03:17:39.849]  I want one for my mom, my dad, my cousin, my brother.
[03:17:39.869 --> 03:17:40.669]  That's a third edition.
[03:17:40.689 --> 03:17:44.271]  We're about to end that and then no more Hillary for Prison shirts in the next month.
[03:17:44.291 --> 03:17:45.991]  If we don't defeat her, that's just the way it is.
[03:17:46.151 --> 03:17:47.592]  42 days starting tomorrow.
[03:17:48.012 --> 03:17:49.873]  In the final countdown, we make
[03:17:51.081 --> 03:17:51.481]  We're good to go.
[03:18:08.746 --> 03:18:10.967]  Let's chomp on our tongues and not talk during it.
[03:18:11.607 --> 03:18:12.908]  But my God, what did you make of that?
[03:18:12.928 --> 03:18:15.689]  I mean, a lot of folks are saying he did good the first 45 minutes.
[03:18:16.009 --> 03:18:17.009]  He got too easy on her.
[03:18:17.049 --> 03:18:17.650]  What was happening?
[03:18:17.930 --> 03:18:20.191]  His advisor said, don't bully the corpse.
[03:18:20.751 --> 03:18:22.852]  He laid down to a great extent.
[03:18:22.872 --> 03:18:23.752]  He still did a great job.
[03:18:23.772 --> 03:18:26.033]  But man, I tell you, she doesn't deserve it.
[03:18:26.694 --> 03:18:27.614]  She doesn't deserve it.
[03:18:27.694 --> 03:18:29.035]  And he actually brought that up.
[03:18:29.075 --> 03:18:34.877]  He said, you know, I came out here and I was ready to say terrible things about Hillary and her family, but they told me not to.
[03:18:34.917 --> 03:18:36.638]  And I thought to myself, I just can't do it.
[03:18:37.398 --> 03:18:40.661]  But she deserves it, and no one would feel sorry for her.
[03:18:40.761 --> 03:18:42.782]  And you could see the look on her face.
[03:18:42.823 --> 03:18:44.684]  She was almost like, stay calm.
[03:18:45.024 --> 03:18:49.328]  And then she got real nasty at the end, figuring out he wasn't going to attack.
[03:18:49.628 --> 03:18:53.131]  It was largely him not fight back, and her attack made me sick.
[03:18:53.271 --> 03:18:55.473]  Yes, and you have said that to me so many times.
[03:18:55.734 --> 03:19:09.548]  It's when they sense the weakness, when they sense, oh, well, he's not going to go and attack me and the debate is almost over now, so I'm going to get those last little jabs in and say something about sexism that has absolutely nothing to do with the debate.
[03:19:11.971 --> 03:19:17.272]  Well, could you believe that they brought up the freaking birther issue again, one more time?
[03:19:17.292 --> 03:19:18.033]  Which she put out.
[03:19:18.273 --> 03:19:20.233]  Which she put out, Sidney Blumenthal.
[03:19:20.253 --> 03:19:22.754]  She's like, how dare you support ISIS when she created it?
[03:19:23.134 --> 03:19:25.515]  Everything she was saying was like her baby.
[03:19:25.695 --> 03:19:29.416]  Well, you know, it's what they say, when you point a finger, you've got three fingers pointing back at you.
[03:19:29.716 --> 03:19:32.057]  And that's how Hillary Clinton, that's how she operates.
[03:19:32.077 --> 03:19:35.878]  She's always pointing at people, but she's always got those fingers pointing back at her.
[03:19:35.918 --> 03:19:36.958]  And I just want to make
[03:19:37.458 --> 03:19:39.519]  This statement, so people understand this.
[03:19:39.559 --> 03:19:47.621]  First of all, I don't think that they really understand how many people in this country were really curious whether or not Obama was born in this country or not.
[03:19:47.981 --> 03:19:53.183]  And this whole birth certificate issue... Why'd he put in three years of the Harvard review that he ran that he was born there?
[03:19:53.383 --> 03:19:53.803]  Exactly.
[03:19:53.823 --> 03:19:55.344]  They set us up to go...
[03:19:56.064 --> 03:19:59.587]  Well, why did it take him so long to release his birth certificate?
[03:19:59.607 --> 03:20:04.051]  The question was, Trump, why did it take you so long to admit that Obama was born here in the U.S.?
[03:20:04.372 --> 03:20:06.954]  Why did it take him so long to prove that he was?
[03:20:07.294 --> 03:20:07.675]  You know what?
[03:20:07.775 --> 03:20:14.301]  It's not racist to question whether or not someone was born in the United States if they want to be the president.
[03:20:14.841 --> 03:20:20.545]  I agree, and your colleague Margaret Howell is here with us from one of the studios with David Nye.
[03:20:20.905 --> 03:20:22.786]  Margaret, we haven't heard from you tonight yet.
[03:20:22.826 --> 03:20:23.647]  You are fired up.
[03:20:24.087 --> 03:20:25.368]  Margaret, what did you make of this?
[03:20:25.408 --> 03:20:27.349]  This is unscripted, teleprompter-free.
[03:20:27.409 --> 03:20:28.430]  Margaret, what do you have to say?
[03:20:28.750 --> 03:20:33.933]  Alex, you know, the victim card that she played tonight, I wish that he'd gone after her harder on ISIS, on Russia, you know.
[03:20:34.234 --> 03:20:35.374]  I was jumping out of my seat.
[03:20:35.414 --> 03:20:39.177]  I know Kit Daniels, his fingers must be on fire right now watching him type.
[03:20:39.637 --> 03:20:43.421]  You know, it was just unbelievable, the lies pouring out of her.
[03:20:43.762 --> 03:20:47.846]  It's hard to watch it, frankly, but I wish... It was like watching the entrance to a sewage treatment plant.
[03:20:47.926 --> 03:20:49.408]  Pretty much, exactly.
[03:20:49.768 --> 03:21:00.861]  You know, the ISIS issue alone, you know, he could have hammered her so hard, implicating Russia for a DNC hack with no proof, you know, and that really is one of my greatest fears, that she's trying to set them up so that if it...
[03:21:01.041 --> 03:21:05.105]  If in fact she does become president, she could then go to war by proxy with Russia.
[03:21:05.125 --> 03:21:12.954]  You know, every time she mentions Russia, it makes me twitch, because it's like she has no evidence, and yet she implicates them with every breath.
[03:21:13.054 --> 03:21:13.935]  It's very disturbing.
[03:21:15.370 --> 03:21:25.213]  Right, I agree that he really could have used that hammer to come after her about the emails, and that was one thing he kind of held back, where he kind of wanted to get into the contents of the hack.
[03:21:25.273 --> 03:21:26.434]  What did we learn from that hack?
[03:21:26.474 --> 03:21:28.254]  You're blaming it on Russia, it could have been China.
[03:21:28.534 --> 03:21:33.916]  Who knows who it could have been, but the contents of the hack showed us, of course, that this whole system was rigged.
[03:21:34.336 --> 03:21:40.338]  But then he didn't take the opportunity to go after her and how she jeopardized the safety of our country.
[03:21:40.698 --> 03:21:43.339]  So I agree, he should have brought that hammer out.
[03:21:43.499 --> 03:21:48.084]  And since Margaret Howell brought this up, I'm going to play this now and get everybody's take on it from Leigh Ann to Margaret, you name it.
[03:21:48.404 --> 03:21:50.686]  This is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff last Friday.
[03:21:51.487 --> 03:21:53.809]  This got no coverage in the U.S.
[03:21:54.510 --> 03:22:03.258]  We played this Sunday and Monday, and it's gotten, and this is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Dunford, saying, we basically ordered to attack the Russians.
[03:22:03.679 --> 03:22:05.961]  I need to get official authorization for World War III.
[03:22:06.642 --> 03:22:07.703]  Now, here is the clip.
[03:22:09.024 --> 03:22:14.026]  What about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped?
[03:22:16.007 --> 03:22:17.028]  All the options.
[03:22:17.048 --> 03:22:18.789]  What do you think of that option, sir?
[03:22:19.609 --> 03:22:27.553]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[03:22:30.735 --> 03:22:33.997]  That's a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I'm not going to make.
[03:22:34.997 --> 03:22:40.081]  And then he goes on to say, we've been asked to stop Russia, they've been invited in by Syria, they've been fighting ISIS.
[03:22:41.162 --> 03:22:41.522]  Are you sure?
[03:22:41.542 --> 03:22:44.164]  Because they keep saying in Congress, and Obama says, attack them.
[03:22:44.865 --> 03:22:48.268]  And you're, I'm going to go back to Margaret, I'm going to go back to Leanne, but you're a former military guy.
[03:22:48.588 --> 03:22:50.409]  Heavy combat, Joe, it's been written about in the newspapers.
[03:22:50.770 --> 03:22:51.871]  Your unit was in heavy combat.
[03:22:52.231 --> 03:22:55.433]  I mean, they tell the military to do stuff without asking, what does it do?
[03:22:55.453 --> 03:22:56.754]  Like, go attack the Russians, Joe.
[03:22:57.435 --> 03:22:58.336]  Because they're battling ISIS.
[03:22:58.356 --> 03:22:59.256]  How do you feel about that?
[03:22:59.577 --> 03:23:00.197]  I don't like that.
[03:23:00.217 --> 03:23:06.462]  I mean, I like the fact that Donald Trump is one of the people that want to actually have good relationship with Russia.
[03:23:06.802 --> 03:23:08.403]  He said that, and what are they doing to us?
[03:23:08.423 --> 03:23:09.864]  But they attack him, though, for that.
[03:23:09.904 --> 03:23:11.005]  I don't understand that.
[03:23:11.065 --> 03:23:13.827]  Like, it's not our job to police the world.
[03:23:13.847 --> 03:23:15.068]  It's not our job to go in.
[03:23:15.108 --> 03:23:16.810]  Well, the Russians aren't starting a fight with us.
[03:23:16.850 --> 03:23:18.151]  If they want to fight, they get one.
[03:23:18.251 --> 03:23:19.612]  Hillary's the only one that wants to fight.
[03:23:19.672 --> 03:23:20.833]  She is a warmonger.
[03:23:21.053 --> 03:23:21.373]  Exactly.
[03:23:21.393 --> 03:23:22.954]  Since when do we go start a fight with Russia?
[03:23:23.014 --> 03:23:24.095]  It was interesting that she wore that.
[03:23:24.115 --> 03:23:24.976]  Who's fighting our enemies?
[03:23:25.536 --> 03:23:31.182]  If she was wearing that red dress, it was symbolic of the blood that's all soaked on her right now.
[03:23:31.202 --> 03:23:37.948]  I agree, but what is it like for you to see the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs telling Congress, you want to know flying, we got to fight the Russians for that.
[03:23:38.168 --> 03:23:39.209]  Doesn't Congress get it?
[03:23:39.469 --> 03:23:45.195]  It ain't the Iraqis, it's the Russians with 10,000 nuclear weapons and submarines off our coast, dumbass!
[03:23:45.916 --> 03:23:46.136]  Right.
[03:23:46.416 --> 03:23:50.340]  I mean, we had a tough enough time in Afghanistan, in Iraq,
[03:23:51.889 --> 03:23:58.465]  Think how difficult it will be to stand up against an actual army that trains all the time, that has high-tech weapons.
[03:23:58.485 --> 03:23:59.949]  Who knows how to use those weapons?
[03:24:01.408 --> 03:24:02.329]  That would be a bloodbath!
[03:24:02.369 --> 03:24:05.872]  Well, listen, we will defeat Russia, and one hour later we'll all be dead.
[03:24:05.932 --> 03:24:06.172]  Yes.
[03:24:06.512 --> 03:24:08.994]  Yes, they'll be more dead than us when the whole Earth's dead.
[03:24:09.434 --> 03:24:12.837]  Yes, we will put more craters on the Russian skeletons.
[03:24:13.378 --> 03:24:16.260]  We'll have five times the craters and skeletons.
[03:24:16.860 --> 03:24:17.741]  We'll all be dead.
[03:24:17.761 --> 03:24:18.742]  They'll all be dead.
[03:24:19.022 --> 03:24:20.644]  What the hell is going on here?
[03:24:20.764 --> 03:24:21.804]  It makes no sense.
[03:24:21.844 --> 03:24:24.166]  Margaret Howell, Leanne Popin, anybody.
[03:24:24.226 --> 03:24:25.147]  David DeFranco.
[03:24:25.227 --> 03:24:26.168]  It's so crazy.
[03:24:26.268 --> 03:24:29.090]  Remember last year, Russia destroyed 33% of ISIS's fighting force.
[03:24:29.130 --> 03:24:29.351]  Thank you!
[03:24:31.452 --> 03:24:33.673]  Through, like, five weeks of bombing strikes.
[03:24:33.893 --> 03:24:35.013]  It only took him five weeks.
[03:24:35.993 --> 03:24:38.814]  You're a Russian agent who doesn't support radical Islam.
[03:24:38.834 --> 03:24:39.154]  Margaret?
[03:24:39.635 --> 03:24:41.375]  You know, that's an excellent point, Kent.
[03:24:41.395 --> 03:24:43.556]  You know, Trump made this point weeks ago.
[03:24:43.576 --> 03:24:44.416]  It went largely ignored.
[03:24:44.436 --> 03:24:45.636]  He said, why do we care?
[03:24:45.696 --> 03:24:47.817]  The Russians are bombing the hell out of ISIS.
[03:24:48.137 --> 03:24:49.177]  Why don't we let them?
[03:24:49.197 --> 03:24:50.518]  You know, that's an excellent point.
[03:24:50.558 --> 03:24:53.078]  Apparently, she's not... Yeah, let them pay for it instead of us.
[03:24:53.299 --> 03:24:55.399]  Well, ISIS is Hillary's little pawns.
[03:24:55.539 --> 03:24:55.839]  Exactly.
[03:24:55.859 --> 03:24:57.340]  But, Margaret, I want you to give this person, like, three minutes.
[03:24:57.400 --> 03:24:57.900]  Go ahead, Margaret.
[03:24:58.240 --> 03:25:03.364]  You know, going back to her points, and she told so many lies tonight, Alex, and I tried to write all of them down.
[03:25:03.424 --> 03:25:04.565]  Russia was a main one for me.
[03:25:04.745 --> 03:25:05.505]  ISIS being formed.
[03:25:05.525 --> 03:25:07.026]  She said ISIS formed in this vacuum.
[03:25:07.407 --> 03:25:11.170]  You know, she was talking about the vacuum of intelligence that she wanted to collect to defeat them.
[03:25:11.570 --> 03:25:12.791]  Trump should have hit her harder.
[03:25:13.011 --> 03:25:13.531]  Thank you.
[03:25:13.591 --> 03:25:15.613]  Trump should have hit her harder on the fact that Obama...
[03:25:16.193 --> 03:25:21.134]  And Clinton herself formed and created ISIS, armed them, funded them, and then gave them the oil in northern Iraq.
[03:25:21.474 --> 03:25:24.315]  You know, all points that he missed, but I thought it was a safe bet by him.
[03:25:24.335 --> 03:25:25.255]  He's got two more.
[03:25:25.275 --> 03:25:27.616]  I just want to see him hit her harder on that.
[03:25:27.656 --> 03:25:31.677]  I think the American people largely, you know, besides us, who's covering this?
[03:25:31.717 --> 03:25:32.657]  So they need to know it.
[03:25:33.278 --> 03:25:35.578]  But hopefully he comes back and hits her harder on this ISIS issue.
[03:25:35.618 --> 03:25:36.058]  Great point.
[03:25:36.078 --> 03:25:38.599]  Leanne McAdoo, the David Knight, then our other crew here.
[03:25:39.119 --> 03:25:43.421]  Well, I absolutely agree with Margaret on this that, you know, he could have hit her harder there.
[03:25:43.821 --> 03:25:48.183]  And the fact that they are wanting to shut down the airspace when the U.S.
[03:25:48.243 --> 03:25:52.185]  is the one that is going in and mistakenly taking out the wrong target.
[03:25:52.685 --> 03:25:56.367]  And Hillary Clinton... And they confirmed launching hellfires on the Syrian military.
[03:25:56.547 --> 03:25:59.609]  They don't want anyone in there who's actually taking out ISIS.
[03:25:59.829 --> 03:26:00.930]  They only want the U.S.
[03:26:00.950 --> 03:26:06.994]  to be allowed to fly over that airspace when they're, you know, dropping weapons into the hands of ISIS accidentally.
[03:26:07.274 --> 03:26:08.595]  So who's giving them these orders?
[03:26:08.635 --> 03:26:11.357]  Because I know that our military is not that incompetent.
[03:26:11.837 --> 03:26:23.805]  And also, Hillary Clinton is running, bragging on the fact that she was the loudest voice that wanted to arm the Syrian rebels, who we have well documented has become ISIS.
[03:26:23.865 --> 03:26:24.806]  It defected ISIS.
[03:26:25.146 --> 03:26:27.387]  David Knight, what do you think of the debate overall?
[03:26:28.168 --> 03:26:34.171]  Well Alex, let me talk about the ISIS and the cyber security issues because we cut a brief fact check on that.
[03:26:34.231 --> 03:26:39.654]  Think about the absurdity of the fact that Hillary Clinton is saying she's going to protect us by physically fighting ISIS.
[03:26:39.974 --> 03:26:43.356]  She's going to protect us by enhancing our cyber security.
[03:26:43.996 --> 03:26:47.718]  Hillary Clinton is going to enhance our cyber security, okay?
[03:26:47.898 --> 03:26:48.519]  What a joke!
[03:26:48.779 --> 03:27:05.248]  And the fact is that she not only created ISIS, the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, their policies created that, enabled it, they trained them, they equipped them, they acted as their air force a week ago this last weekend, decimating a Syrian base that was protecting a Syrian city.
[03:27:05.308 --> 03:27:09.771]  That was a frontline firebase stopping al-Qaeda and ISIS advance.
[03:27:10.011 --> 03:27:14.116]  Yes, what an amazing series of absurd lies.
[03:27:14.236 --> 03:27:21.085]  I mean, anybody who looks at this and talks, here's her talk about cyber security, look, what she wants to do is censor the internet.
[03:27:21.105 --> 03:27:23.387]  She wants to use their al-Qaeda, here's an example.
[03:27:24.059 --> 03:27:26.019]  We do a video against Al-Qaeda or ISIS.
[03:27:26.520 --> 03:27:33.741]  YouTube censors it and says you can't monetize this, which is how we pay the bills, because you said ISIS, period.
[03:27:34.041 --> 03:27:36.762]  But then ABC and CBS and NBC can say ISIS.
[03:27:37.102 --> 03:27:39.303]  We can't, even though we're bigger than them in most cases.
[03:27:39.923 --> 03:27:41.263]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:27:41.343 --> 03:27:44.704]  That's what they do with the transcripts from the shooter in Orlando.
[03:27:44.964 --> 03:27:48.045]  They took out ISIS whenever he mentioned it in the calls with police.
[03:27:48.625 --> 03:27:49.505]  They're censoring everywhere.
[03:27:50.619 --> 03:27:56.986]  We've had the whistleblowers on where four years ago they told them you can't investigate mosque, you can't investigate Muslims, you can't investigate Islam.
[03:27:57.006 --> 03:27:59.068]  They're like, you're not allowed to investigate Muslims.
[03:27:59.128 --> 03:28:00.729]  So of course, then they blame the FBI.
[03:28:00.770 --> 03:28:09.839]  I'm not defending, but the FBI goes, oh, well, two years ago his dad warned the bomber of New York and New Jersey was going to attack because the FBI is not allowed to.
[03:28:13.288 --> 03:28:15.049]  They're not rioters, they're peaceful protesters.
[03:28:15.069 --> 03:28:15.950]  Daniels, David Knight?
[03:28:16.250 --> 03:28:27.877]  Yeah, I remember, David, during the... I forgot what shooting it was, but Hillary Clinton locked an investigation into the mosque where the shooter was visiting.
[03:28:28.478 --> 03:28:30.719]  So yeah, there's been a... San Bernardino.
[03:28:30.859 --> 03:28:34.722]  Well, let's talk about the shooting that just happened this last weekend at the mall.
[03:28:35.022 --> 03:28:37.083]  Another Muslim radical jihadi...
[03:28:38.084 --> 03:28:43.569]  Not only another Muslim, but somebody who tweeted out back in January, we win, I vote for Hillary Clinton.
[03:28:43.609 --> 03:28:48.833]  Will she disavow this Islamic terrorist who just murdered five people in a mall?
[03:28:48.853 --> 03:28:49.894]  And how paradoxical is that?
[03:28:49.934 --> 03:28:52.616]  She'll probably invite his parents to come on stage with her.
[03:28:52.636 --> 03:28:53.697]  That's what I was about to say, yeah.
[03:28:55.839 --> 03:28:56.799]  Near Seattle.
[03:28:56.979 --> 03:29:03.580]  I worked on the website this weekend, and when the news broke, you know, I was like, is this really something we would put on the website because we don't know what's happening?
[03:29:03.600 --> 03:29:05.581]  All it was saying, the suspect was Hispanic.
[03:29:05.661 --> 03:29:11.242]  And when I looked into it, I was like, the victims were randomly... Yeah, they blamed it on Hispanics and the guys from Turkey.
[03:29:11.462 --> 03:29:17.423]  But the red flag to me was the fact that he was randomly selecting his targets.
[03:29:17.463 --> 03:29:20.763]  We have seen that with every single Islamic terror attack in the U.S.
[03:29:20.803 --> 03:29:21.583]  in the past five years.
[03:29:21.603 --> 03:29:24.644]  Well, they're all, if we look at it, they're suppressed.
[03:29:25.084 --> 03:29:29.507]  If we look at his Tumblr page, he puts out Subham Allah, Glory be to God.
[03:29:29.527 --> 03:29:31.128]  He has comments about serial killers.
[03:29:31.168 --> 03:29:32.229]  He praises ISIS.
[03:29:32.509 --> 03:29:34.531]  This guy is a Turkish citizen.
[03:29:34.571 --> 03:29:39.634]  He may be a permanent legal resident here, but he didn't want to become an American citizen.
[03:29:40.014 --> 03:29:44.657]  Nevertheless, even as a permanent legal resident, he gets to vote in local elections.
[03:29:44.958 --> 03:29:46.279]  And he supports Hillary Clinton.
[03:29:46.479 --> 03:29:47.099]  And he supports ISIS.
[03:29:47.139 --> 03:29:50.842]  These guys are religiously whacked out, whether it's Indonesia or Saudi Arabia.
[03:29:51.542 --> 03:29:57.446]  They go kill their neighbors because they saw their wife with purple socks on wearing a damn garbage bag over her head.
[03:29:57.766 --> 03:29:59.007]  These are crazy people.
[03:29:59.448 --> 03:30:00.268]  I'm not against them.
[03:30:00.348 --> 03:30:01.329]  I wish they were normal.
[03:30:01.609 --> 03:30:03.270]  I don't care what color your skin is.
[03:30:03.811 --> 03:30:10.675]  I mean, my God, it's, I just, these people, you can have white Muslims, black Muslims, you know, brown Muslims.
[03:30:10.715 --> 03:30:16.419]  The point is, a lot of these, the good Muslims we all know, are heretics fleeing this stuff.
[03:30:17.520 --> 03:30:19.341]  You know, we don't want to fight with Muslims.
[03:30:19.421 --> 03:30:19.662]  I don't,
[03:30:20.382 --> 03:30:28.125]  But will Hillary disavow this racist Islamic terrorist who just tweeted his support, tweeted his racism?
[03:30:28.305 --> 03:30:29.605]  Will she disavow him?
[03:30:30.065 --> 03:30:36.427]  Everybody is still talking about the Ku Klux Klan guy, David Duke, but will she disavow Mark Hansen?
[03:30:39.048 --> 03:30:46.015]  Well, no, they don't want to alienate that new voting bloc that they're bringing in with all of these immigrants, the refugees.
[03:30:46.035 --> 03:30:48.578]  They're really selling themselves as, hey, we're on your team.
[03:30:48.598 --> 03:30:49.659]  We're going to give you Detroit.
[03:30:49.679 --> 03:30:53.583]  We're going to let you rebuild Detroit because that's the new voting bloc that they're bringing in.
[03:30:53.643 --> 03:31:02.772]  But for now, they still have to go in and pretend that they care about the black community, which is why the only reason why Hillary almost went to Charlotte to go and exploit
[03:31:03.172 --> 03:31:03.813]  We're good to go.
[03:31:33.898 --> 03:31:35.840]  I'm going to admit it, okay?
[03:31:36.060 --> 03:31:38.722]  I thought with the WikiLeaks that it was just her selling U.S.
[03:31:38.762 --> 03:31:39.183]  secrets.
[03:31:39.563 --> 03:31:41.905]  I didn't know she was representing the Chinese president when that all came out.
[03:31:41.945 --> 03:31:43.306]  So it's always worse than I thought.
[03:31:43.326 --> 03:31:43.867]  And I'll say this.
[03:31:44.167 --> 03:31:44.888]  She's falling down.
[03:31:44.928 --> 03:31:48.150]  The Secret Service tells us about it, tells us, you know, it happens.
[03:31:48.451 --> 03:31:51.273]  She can't really give speeches anywhere across the country.
[03:31:51.873 --> 03:31:53.215]  So I mean, I don't know how.
[03:31:53.235 --> 03:31:56.838]  I guess she rested six, seven days, but from Monday to Monday, it's seven days.
[03:31:57.398 --> 03:32:00.199]  But, I thought she'd at least have a coughing fit, so when I'm wrong, I'll admit it.
[03:32:00.619 --> 03:32:05.820]  I said coughing fit, 90% chance, 34% chance, collapse, have to quit.
[03:32:06.080 --> 03:32:09.200]  She had to do that Republican debate, where she would have to, you know, wait longer, and I can wait.
[03:32:09.780 --> 03:32:10.521]  I've been proven wrong.
[03:32:10.821 --> 03:32:14.321]  Hillary, looked drugged up, she was low energy, she looked sick.
[03:32:14.621 --> 03:32:15.682]  I was right.
[03:32:15.802 --> 03:32:19.362]  I was right, she was pumped full of life extension technologies.
[03:32:19.522 --> 03:32:20.363]  I was right.
[03:32:20.383 --> 03:32:21.103]  And then Margaret Howell.
[03:32:21.203 --> 03:32:22.163]  Okay, now I'm going to say it.
[03:32:22.543 --> 03:32:24.205]  When I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
[03:32:24.666 --> 03:32:26.288]  Alex Jones was wrong.
[03:32:26.608 --> 03:32:27.910]  So why am I wrong?
[03:32:28.290 --> 03:32:30.693]  Leanne and Margaret, everybody else.
[03:32:31.034 --> 03:32:31.555]  I called it.
[03:32:31.755 --> 03:32:40.386]  She was pumped full of life extension technologies and her skin looked so good and glowing because of all those baby's blood IVs that she got before the election.
[03:32:40.446 --> 03:32:40.626]  Yep.
[03:32:41.126 --> 03:32:41.427]  Margaret?
[03:32:42.065 --> 03:32:42.805]  That's right, Leigh-Anne.
[03:32:42.825 --> 03:32:46.647]  You know, you made some excellent points about racism, and I just want to touch on them for people really quickly.
[03:32:47.427 --> 03:32:54.829]  You know, she is half-dead, we all know that, but going back to that racist point, where was... Hillary Clinton hates black people, I'm convinced of that.
[03:32:54.969 --> 03:32:55.950]  Oh my gosh, she hates everybody!
[03:32:56.010 --> 03:32:56.870]  She hates everybody!
[03:32:56.890 --> 03:32:59.211]  Margaret, she has hot sauce in her bag, come on.
[03:32:59.531 --> 03:33:05.298]  Just talking about this group, you know, the mayor of Charlotte said, please don't come, please don't come, just delay that visit, just a little please.
[03:33:05.699 --> 03:33:10.324]  You know, we need to bring this back to her because she kept calling Donald Trump a racist, racist liar, racist, racist.
[03:33:10.384 --> 03:33:13.188]  I was trying to count how many times she was saying it.
[03:33:13.228 --> 03:33:15.190]  But, you know, talk about racist.
[03:33:15.371 --> 03:33:16.192]  Where was Donald?
[03:33:16.252 --> 03:33:17.673]  I wish that he brought this up, mandatory.
[03:33:18.474 --> 03:33:22.599]  Mandatory sentencing guidelines in the 90s that disproportionately jail blacks in this country.
[03:33:22.639 --> 03:33:23.580]  He didn't do it.
[03:33:23.761 --> 03:33:24.542]  Of course not.
[03:33:24.562 --> 03:33:26.824]  She's not responsible at all.
[03:33:26.904 --> 03:33:28.206]  She told Clinton to do it.
[03:33:28.727 --> 03:33:30.649]  She's like, I'm going to get these black people.
[03:33:30.969 --> 03:33:32.571]  Seriously, bring them to heel.
[03:33:32.832 --> 03:33:33.533]  Bring them to heel.
[03:33:34.073 --> 03:33:34.754]  Bring them to heel.
[03:33:34.834 --> 03:33:36.656]  But she is half dead, on a different note.
[03:33:49.534 --> 03:34:01.721]  Oh man, you know, listening to Roger Stone, we talked a lot about the Diebold systems here, you know, giving the UN control of our electoral system, possibly superdelegates, but the good news is, Alex, there are more of us than there are of them.
[03:34:02.102 --> 03:34:03.883]  That is for sure going to any Trump rally.
[03:34:03.903 --> 03:34:05.184]  You know, I went to the one here in Austin.
[03:34:05.584 --> 03:34:08.866]  It was overwhelming, his support, and this is in Austin!
[03:34:09.466 --> 03:34:17.030]  You know, I just, the only thing that I could think would be to steal it, if they can't do it electronically, just somehow, you know, supersede with the UN.
[03:34:17.050 --> 03:34:17.650]  But you know what?
[03:34:17.711 --> 03:34:19.151]  There's more of us than there are of them.
[03:34:19.231 --> 03:34:19.491]  I agree.
[03:34:19.511 --> 03:34:20.352]  Let me just say this.
[03:34:20.812 --> 03:34:23.053]  Look at this studio, with the crew.
[03:34:23.073 --> 03:34:25.535]  Because you see us on air, but you know, the men and women.
[03:34:26.435 --> 03:34:30.457]  Race, color, and creed that are pro-human, red-blooded people who are my brothers and sisters.
[03:34:30.957 --> 03:34:32.297]  They are Infowars.
[03:34:32.618 --> 03:34:36.459]  You, the listeners, are just as important as the crew members or the people on air.
[03:34:36.479 --> 03:34:37.559]  I don't say that condescendingly.
[03:34:37.940 --> 03:34:39.220]  You are the Infowar.
[03:34:39.720 --> 03:34:49.944]  And the incredible crew from Kit Daniels to Adon Salazar to David Knight to Joe Biggs to Margaret Howell to Ashley Beckford to everybody.
[03:34:50.324 --> 03:34:52.205]  This is incredible, the crew we've got.
[03:34:52.245 --> 03:34:53.085]  It's so special.
[03:34:53.385 --> 03:34:54.326]  We've built this together.
[03:34:54.946 --> 03:34:55.686]  This is amazing.
[03:34:56.026 --> 03:35:05.310]  So I'd like Joe Biggs' comments on this, all of you, and then I'll go back to Leigh Ann and I want to play a few news clips we've gotten and give the phone number out, take some calls.
[03:35:05.890 --> 03:35:12.192]  I think one of the interesting things that happened tonight was when the debate host came out and asked Donald Trump about his taxes.
[03:35:12.232 --> 03:35:13.193]  Was he going to release it?
[03:35:13.693 --> 03:35:19.435]  And Donald Trump comes out and goes, yeah, I'll release my taxes when you release your 33,000 deleted emails.
[03:35:19.455 --> 03:35:20.696]  That's the best one.
[03:35:20.836 --> 03:35:21.596]  Exactly!
[03:35:21.636 --> 03:35:24.017]  She won't release the foundation info!
[03:35:25.185 --> 03:35:27.186]  Why does he have to always do exactly?
[03:35:27.266 --> 03:35:28.347]  I don't know what C means.
[03:35:28.367 --> 03:35:29.127]  What is bleach bit?
[03:35:30.928 --> 03:35:35.530]  My concussion, my brain damage stopped me from being able to do my job.
[03:35:35.570 --> 03:35:38.891]  You put a video out showing them basically as a joke covering up emails.
[03:35:38.931 --> 03:35:40.852]  They blocked your video.
[03:35:41.012 --> 03:35:43.514]  Which we should have put on Facebook and said this is deleted.
[03:35:43.814 --> 03:35:44.534]  Or this is censored.
[03:35:44.554 --> 03:35:45.875]  See what Paul did, 16 million views.
[03:35:46.115 --> 03:35:47.355]  Yeah, I posted it again today.
[03:35:47.375 --> 03:35:50.077]  Yeah, put it up and say this is censored on Facebook, brother.
[03:35:50.970 --> 03:35:54.932]  Yeah, when it comes to debates, people don't remember policy statements.
[03:35:54.992 --> 03:35:56.432]  What they remember are one-liners.
[03:35:56.712 --> 03:35:58.793]  Trump had just about every single zinger.
[03:35:58.893 --> 03:36:00.634]  He had great policy statements, too.
[03:36:00.794 --> 03:36:06.216]  Yeah, he did, too, but he won the debate through the one-liners, just like what Joe Big said with the deleted emails.
[03:36:06.276 --> 03:36:07.737]  He won, but not as big as I wanted.
[03:36:07.757 --> 03:36:08.417]  I'll just be honest.
[03:36:08.737 --> 03:36:10.058]  Well, let's look at it this way, though.
[03:36:10.158 --> 03:36:17.960]  You know, we're looking at this as one debate, but if we look at it as three debates, and if this is his weakest performance in a debate, we got really good things.
[03:36:18.020 --> 03:36:18.741]  No, he still won.
[03:36:19.221 --> 03:36:22.262]  I mean, I'd say she got about a 70, he got about an 85.
[03:36:23.483 --> 03:36:26.264]  But, I mean, man, everything she said was a lie.
[03:36:26.284 --> 03:36:27.724]  It was like cuckoo land.
[03:36:28.244 --> 03:36:32.866]  But, you know, maybe the Trump campaign is looking at this as a series of debates, kind of like the art of war.
[03:36:33.106 --> 03:36:34.347]  Like, they're not focusing.
[03:36:34.387 --> 03:36:37.708]  Yeah, he was soft on... No, he was meant to look presidential and not mean.
[03:36:38.248 --> 03:36:40.530]  No, no, listen.
[03:36:40.570 --> 03:36:51.817]  Well, yeah, if he gets all of his zingers and all of his hard knockout punches in this first debate, you know, then it'll already, it'll be old by the time the next debates roll around.
[03:36:52.117 --> 03:36:57.921]  So he's got to, you know, she probably over-prepared for him and his zingers, and that's not what he brought tonight.
[03:36:57.961 --> 03:37:02.404]  Tonight, he's tried to stay presidential, tried to stay on what his plan was for the country.
[03:37:08.488 --> 03:37:09.249]  Oh, Donald.
[03:37:09.849 --> 03:37:13.051]  And then, boy, but then when he was at the end... I think that was the medication kicking in.
[03:37:13.071 --> 03:37:14.031]  She was stabbing, though.
[03:37:14.051 --> 03:37:14.772]  Did you see her at the end?
[03:37:14.792 --> 03:37:15.973]  That was desperation at the end.
[03:37:16.393 --> 03:37:18.254]  She brought all the sexism and the racism and crap.
[03:37:18.274 --> 03:37:18.954]  Right, exactly.
[03:37:19.054 --> 03:37:20.535]  She wanted to have that closing statement.
[03:37:20.555 --> 03:37:22.196]  She's the last person to bring anything up.
[03:37:22.216 --> 03:37:25.138]  She wanted to have those... She realized... She's way more tail than a toilet seat.
[03:37:27.658 --> 03:37:29.919]  Alex, I didn't see the entire debate.
[03:37:29.959 --> 03:37:33.000]  I was getting little bits and pieces of it, so I can't really comment on one.
[03:37:33.040 --> 03:37:34.281]  You were busy filing reports.
[03:37:34.701 --> 03:37:35.341]  That's right, that's right.
[03:37:35.361 --> 03:37:43.425]  I was filing reports, so I was getting bits and pieces of it, so I couldn't really get a sense, I'll have to go back and watch it, I couldn't get a sense of the overall dynamic of this.
[03:37:43.485 --> 03:37:51.128]  But I've got to say, that we go back and we look at the Reagan-Carter debates, and that was, prior to this, that was probably the largest one that we had.
[03:37:51.708 --> 03:37:52.649]  And when we look at that,
[03:37:53.129 --> 03:37:59.253]  We understand that Ronald Reagan had a really bad debate as part of that series, but the other debates that he had were very good.
[03:37:59.293 --> 03:38:02.154]  So one debate really doesn't make that much difference one way or the other.
[03:38:02.234 --> 03:38:14.962]  What we learned from Hillary Clinton was that if she rests for six days and prepares for six days, she can talk for 90 minutes, even though they were about five minutes late starting and she disappeared right after the debate was over.
[03:38:15.202 --> 03:38:18.364]  So you charge a battery six days, you have 90 minute flight time.
[03:38:18.684 --> 03:38:20.105]  But guess what's been going on the entire time?
[03:38:20.165 --> 03:38:21.585]  Trump's been going all around the country.
[03:38:21.605 --> 03:38:26.008]  Trump had a debate today, or not a debate, but a speech today.
[03:38:26.068 --> 03:38:28.169]  Why didn't Lester Holt go two, three hours?
[03:38:28.449 --> 03:38:29.930]  He went six, seven minutes extra.
[03:38:29.970 --> 03:38:32.271]  That's news in and of itself, to break that.
[03:38:32.651 --> 03:38:34.272]  Why didn't they just break the mold?
[03:38:34.292 --> 03:38:36.452]  See, because Hillary can't handle it.
[03:38:37.293 --> 03:38:39.174]  I want to give out the toll-free number.
[03:38:39.194 --> 03:38:42.215]  We're going to come back after this break and take some of your phone calls.
[03:38:42.235 --> 03:38:42.695]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:38:42.715 --> 03:38:43.035]  877-789-2539.
[03:38:43.315 --> 03:38:49.437]  If you're a new viewer or a new listener, I'm going to give that again for you.
[03:38:49.698 --> 03:38:51.738]  But long-time callers, first-time callers, 877-789-2539.
[03:38:51.918 --> 03:38:52.178]  Specifically,
[03:38:56.320 --> 03:38:58.780]  With quick comments or questions on the debate tonight, 877-789-2539.
[03:38:58.800 --> 03:39:00.661]  We're opening the phones up right now.
[03:39:00.681 --> 03:39:00.741]  877-789-2539.
[03:39:00.761 --> 03:39:02.921]  A lot of folks are like, what?
[03:39:02.941 --> 03:39:03.381]  We're taking calls?
[03:39:03.401 --> 03:39:03.461]  Yes.
[03:39:03.481 --> 03:39:03.741]  877-789-Alex.
[03:39:03.761 --> 03:39:03.881]  877-789-2539.
[03:39:03.921 --> 03:39:05.822]  We've got a huge crew here, free for all.
[03:39:05.862 --> 03:39:09.022]  We're not using teleprompters because there's no corporate board boss.
[03:39:09.502 --> 03:39:11.963]  I'm going to play a clip here in a minute, but I'm going to be honest.
[03:39:24.820 --> 03:39:27.362]  Ashley Beckford has been a listener for 10 years.
[03:39:27.402 --> 03:39:28.242]  She's a great lady.
[03:39:28.262 --> 03:39:30.264]  What color she is doesn't matter.
[03:39:30.284 --> 03:39:32.645]  Whether you've got dark hair, red hair, or whatever.
[03:39:33.085 --> 03:39:33.926]  She's a human being.
[03:39:34.006 --> 03:39:34.806]  She's really smart.
[03:39:35.247 --> 03:39:39.489]  I feel sorry for her when I heard, you're sending her to the Democratic Party event tonight.
[03:39:39.969 --> 03:39:41.490]  And Rob Dews was like, yeah, she's a great reporter.
[03:39:41.510 --> 03:39:42.851]  And I went, I didn't say anything to Rob.
[03:39:42.891 --> 03:39:45.193]  He was in there right before we went live about 6.30.
[03:39:45.253 --> 03:39:46.453]  I went, mm-hmm.
[03:39:47.194 --> 03:39:51.957]  Because the Democrats, I'm just being honest here, they treat black people
[03:39:53.064 --> 03:39:53.524]  So bad.
[03:39:54.165 --> 03:39:56.446]  And they just think they can do whatever they want.
[03:39:56.466 --> 03:39:57.866]  They're a voting base, they're not people.
[03:39:58.067 --> 03:40:02.209]  Yeah, and so she goes to this, we have this clip coming up, where they treat her like crap.
[03:40:02.909 --> 03:40:03.769]  They treat her so bad.
[03:40:03.790 --> 03:40:09.612]  So we have a commercial break we haven't done, and then after that, we will play the Ashley Beckford report.
[03:40:09.652 --> 03:40:19.598]  But I mean, you know, I'm gonna be honest, when I was sending Leigh-Anne out, or you out, Biggs, I feel sorry for folks I send out to be with around Democrats, because Democrats have turned into a cult.
[03:40:19.638 --> 03:40:20.278]  What do you say about that?
[03:40:21.872 --> 03:40:22.633]  I don't really mind it.
[03:40:22.653 --> 03:40:23.313]  I like to own them.
[03:40:24.074 --> 03:40:24.714]  It's fun for me.
[03:40:25.295 --> 03:40:28.237]  I like them to get all smug and smirk at me.
[03:40:28.317 --> 03:40:30.639]  And there's our crew in there working.
[03:40:30.679 --> 03:40:32.161]  You've got everybody in there getting ready.
[03:40:32.181 --> 03:40:33.342]  Because I'll just go off on them.
[03:40:33.382 --> 03:40:33.822]  I don't care.
[03:40:33.842 --> 03:40:34.583]  I agree.
[03:40:34.603 --> 03:40:36.024]  You're not going to get in my face.
[03:40:36.044 --> 03:40:37.345]  You're not going to make me back down.
[03:40:37.785 --> 03:40:41.208]  I'm going to sit there and I'm going to come back at you and hammer it as much as I can.
[03:40:41.328 --> 03:40:44.591]  Let me ask Ali a question, or Marcos Morales up here.
[03:40:44.611 --> 03:40:45.752]  I've been working 14 hours already.
[03:40:45.772 --> 03:40:46.693]  They've been working like 18 hours.
[03:40:47.694 --> 03:40:48.254]  Any comments?
[03:40:48.274 --> 03:40:49.796]  This is not pre-planned.
[03:40:49.936 --> 03:40:50.617]  This is how it works.
[03:40:50.637 --> 03:40:52.398]  Do you have any comments about what's happening?
[03:40:52.439 --> 03:40:55.902]  I wish we'd play first this ad and then the Ashley Beckford.
[03:40:55.922 --> 03:41:01.268]  I think we should play the Ashley Beckford first and then play ads.
[03:41:01.668 --> 03:41:03.090]  People are going to be watching this.
[03:41:03.130 --> 03:41:04.231]  This made me sad earlier.
[03:41:04.291 --> 03:41:06.493]  It's not like we're getting some score against Democrats.
[03:41:06.894 --> 03:41:09.056]  It's just calling her an Uncle Tom.
[03:41:10.151 --> 03:41:11.191]  Well, I don't even know what that means.
[03:41:11.711 --> 03:41:13.772]  Because she doesn't just blindly support Hillary.
[03:41:14.152 --> 03:41:14.772]  Swarm-monger.
[03:41:14.792 --> 03:41:15.432]  It's very sad.
[03:41:15.592 --> 03:41:17.773]  Well, that Uncle Tom thing is so old.
[03:41:17.953 --> 03:41:19.153]  It's so old.
[03:41:19.213 --> 03:41:27.595]  It's like, get a new term and the black people that have gotten off that thought plantation are not even phased by that anymore.
[03:41:27.935 --> 03:41:31.615]  But it's like, they're going to call you a coon or they're going to call you an Uncle Tom.
[03:41:31.675 --> 03:41:32.355]  That's their words.
[03:41:32.375 --> 03:41:35.856]  But it was Uncle Tom was siding with Republicans and people.
[03:41:36.116 --> 03:41:38.617]  I mean, the point is, is the Democrats are the ones that did it.
[03:41:38.737 --> 03:41:39.597]  They're racist.
[03:41:41.149 --> 03:41:47.575]  Hey guys, just real quick, Ashley Beckford, she's back and she's going to do a report real soon.
[03:41:47.615 --> 03:41:48.956]  She'll be live with us pretty soon.
[03:41:53.816 --> 03:41:55.137]  It was a lot worse.
[03:41:56.057 --> 03:41:56.798]  I like your voice.
[03:41:56.818 --> 03:41:57.799]  Thank you very much.
[03:41:57.819 --> 03:41:58.399]  She's very traumatized.
[03:41:58.439 --> 03:41:58.839]  A lot went down.
[03:41:58.859 --> 03:42:05.203]  I guess she got surrounded by some rabid Hillary supporters and she'll be here to tell us all about it here in a couple minutes.
[03:42:18.172 --> 03:42:18.773]  I sure will.
[03:42:18.913 --> 03:42:21.236]  Is she going to be in your studio or my studio?
[03:42:21.757 --> 03:42:22.118]  I don't know.
[03:42:22.218 --> 03:42:22.658]  Where do you want her?
[03:42:22.879 --> 03:42:23.660]  Well, wherever you want.
[03:42:23.780 --> 03:42:25.442]  I mean, let's bring her in here.
[03:42:25.462 --> 03:42:28.667]  You can go in there with Biggs.
[03:42:28.867 --> 03:42:30.549]  I mean, with McBrain.
[03:42:30.589 --> 03:42:31.791]  Biggs and McBrain in there.
[03:42:31.811 --> 03:42:33.253]  I gotta point this out real quick, Alex.
[03:42:33.533 --> 03:42:37.037]  Ashley just found more Hillary supporters in one night than we have done in six months.
[03:42:37.057 --> 03:42:38.719]  No, I mean, Leigh-Anne was in California.
[03:42:38.759 --> 03:42:39.901]  She lives in folly places.
[03:42:39.941 --> 03:42:40.742]  We couldn't find her.
[03:42:40.762 --> 03:42:41.082]  I know.
[03:42:41.162 --> 03:42:41.943]  I told her once.
[03:42:41.963 --> 03:42:43.005]  I was like, go to the cemetery.
[03:42:43.025 --> 03:42:44.346]  That's where you're going to find Hillary voters.
[03:42:44.366 --> 03:42:47.089]  I mean, if we elected Sanders, I would say, okay, that's what you wanted.
[03:42:47.450 --> 03:42:48.972]  At least he wants to tax megabanks.
[03:42:49.332 --> 03:42:50.173]  That's why they didn't want him.
[03:42:50.313 --> 03:42:52.514]  I was in California for, what, a week and a half, two weeks?
[03:42:52.714 --> 03:42:56.477]  And I went to all of these Hillary Clinton events and these Sanders events.
[03:42:56.997 --> 03:43:04.002]  And at the Hillary Clinton event in Long Beach, I could barely find any Hillary Clinton supporters whatsoever.
[03:43:04.702 --> 03:43:06.983]  It was mostly people going there to see her live.
[03:43:07.063 --> 03:43:09.365]  Oh yeah, that's why Trump's like 15 points ahead in the polls.
[03:43:09.705 --> 03:43:10.565]  It's why they're panicking.
[03:43:10.846 --> 03:43:13.187]  This is the whole establishment doing everything they could to fail.
[03:43:13.587 --> 03:43:18.110]  Here is Ashley Beckford's report, and we're going to come back with her in studio.
[03:43:18.130 --> 03:43:22.052]  There's not time before she gets in, we can play the ad too, because we do have to fund this operation.
[03:43:22.332 --> 03:43:28.916]  Infowarsstore.com folks, this is very expensive, this is not free, and I'm crazy enough not to even have ads, but we've got a lot of great products.
[03:43:28.976 --> 03:43:30.457]  Infowarsstore.com, stay with us.
[03:43:31.107 --> 03:43:33.673]  I'm not gonna be- Oh, this is InfoWars!
[03:43:36.499 --> 03:43:38.043]  Wow, okay.
[03:43:38.103 --> 03:43:38.584]  Are you ready?
[03:43:40.238 --> 03:43:41.118]  Okay.
[03:43:41.158 --> 03:43:41.599]  Wow.
[03:43:41.839 --> 03:43:43.939]  This is a wild, wild shirt.
[03:43:44.059 --> 03:43:47.140]  Please tell me, sir, where you got your shirt?
[03:43:47.340 --> 03:43:49.521]  What is the purpose of this?
[03:43:50.141 --> 03:43:51.481]  All the faces of Hillary?
[03:43:51.682 --> 03:43:53.222]  Are these all her lie faces?
[03:43:53.242 --> 03:43:54.282]  It's called Hillary paparazzi.
[03:43:54.422 --> 03:43:54.642]  Okay.
[03:43:55.143 --> 03:43:56.403]  And I had to get it online.
[03:43:57.263 --> 03:44:01.384]  And I saw someone wear it and I thought it was really out there and outlandish and outgoing like me.
[03:44:01.484 --> 03:44:02.725]  So I ordered it online.
[03:44:03.225 --> 03:44:03.545]  Okay.
[03:44:04.165 --> 03:44:06.566]  So are you a Hillary Clinton supporter then?
[03:44:06.886 --> 03:44:07.827]  Obviously, yeah.
[03:44:07.847 --> 03:44:09.448]  Okay, well what brought you here?
[03:44:09.468 --> 03:44:12.950]  Is it because you wanted to see her get destroyed by Donald Trump tonight?
[03:44:14.050 --> 03:44:15.671]  It's quite the opposite, actually.
[03:44:15.691 --> 03:44:17.152]  He's bullying her.
[03:44:17.232 --> 03:44:17.912]  He's terrible.
[03:44:18.333 --> 03:44:20.154]  He's bullying her tonight, you think?
[03:44:20.914 --> 03:44:21.975]  Oh, definitely not.
[03:44:22.075 --> 03:44:25.777]  She's been telling a lot of lies and he hasn't even hit her hard.
[03:44:25.837 --> 03:44:27.438]  How does it feel to be an Uncle Tom?
[03:44:28.118 --> 03:44:29.659]  How does it feel to be an Uncle Tom?
[03:44:30.279 --> 03:44:31.739]  Don't get me started, buddy.
[03:44:31.759 --> 03:44:33.800]  You don't want to mess with me on that.
[03:44:33.840 --> 03:44:35.101]  Have you even read?
[03:44:35.181 --> 03:44:36.421]  You're a race trainer.
[03:44:36.461 --> 03:44:37.261]  Are you serious?
[03:44:37.802 --> 03:44:40.062]  Have you even read Harriet Beecher Stowe?
[03:44:40.283 --> 03:44:41.343]  Have you even read the book?
[03:44:41.623 --> 03:44:43.764]  He probably doesn't know who Uncle Tom even is.
[03:44:48.556 --> 03:44:53.439]  Wow, wow, I am literally, I'm holding back right now.
[03:44:53.899 --> 03:44:56.500]  I'm Ashley Beckford for Infowars.com.
[03:44:56.541 --> 03:44:58.822]  This guy is a literal racist.
[03:44:59.182 --> 03:45:02.704]  Okay, I finally see why he supports Hillary Clinton.
[03:45:03.064 --> 03:45:04.425]  This is insane.
[03:45:04.805 --> 03:45:07.507]  These people come up to me, they wanna call me an Uncle Tom.
[03:45:07.547 --> 03:45:09.588]  They've never even read Harriet Beecher Stowe.
[03:45:09.608 --> 03:45:13.750]  They have no idea who that character even was or what it even means.
[03:45:14.330 --> 03:45:16.892]  That was so racist and so disgusting.
[03:45:17.572 --> 03:45:19.234]  I'm going to have to talk to this guy again.
[03:45:19.394 --> 03:45:22.778]  I'm going to have to pinpoint how he got this idea.
[03:45:23.098 --> 03:45:29.085]  Because I would imagine, just from my viewpoint, that he's a member of the LGBT community.
[03:45:29.465 --> 03:45:30.907]  And the bottom line is this.
[03:45:31.227 --> 03:45:34.271]  Hillary Clinton supports Saudi Arabia.
[03:45:34.611 --> 03:45:37.735]  She supports African countries, anyone who will give her money.
[03:45:38.275 --> 03:45:41.397]  And these countries throw gay people off buildings.
[03:45:41.778 --> 03:45:43.759]  They hate homosexuals.
[03:45:44.079 --> 03:45:47.522]  They hate anything that is against Islam.
[03:45:47.882 --> 03:45:51.445]  And for him to support Hillary Clinton, then attack me out of nowhere.
[03:45:51.585 --> 03:45:55.528]  He said before the camera came on, oh, I'm not going to be like, oh, this is Infowars.
[03:45:55.568 --> 03:45:56.528]  I'm not going to talk to you.
[03:45:56.909 --> 03:45:59.831]  Then he goes on camera ready to attack me.
[03:46:00.331 --> 03:46:02.092]  What a sick, sick individual.
[03:46:02.192 --> 03:46:04.753]  There are people laughing here like hyenas.
[03:46:04.873 --> 03:46:08.094]  Hillary Clinton supporters are completely insane.
[03:46:08.454 --> 03:46:09.975]  Stay tuned for more updates.
[03:46:10.155 --> 03:46:13.937]  This is a wild debate and it's going to be a wild six weeks until the election.
[03:46:30.964 --> 03:46:31.324]  I don't
[03:46:51.852 --> 03:46:52.233]  I don't know.
[03:47:09.033 --> 03:47:10.054]  BrainForce is here.
[03:47:10.574 --> 03:47:12.875]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:47:13.135 --> 03:47:21.019]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:47:21.779 --> 03:47:25.381]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[03:47:25.401 --> 03:47:27.742]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:47:28.103 --> 03:47:31.644]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:47:31.684 --> 03:47:34.826]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:47:35.306 --> 03:47:40.090]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:47:40.110 --> 03:47:42.531]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[03:47:42.872 --> 03:47:47.315]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:47:47.475 --> 03:47:49.496]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:47:50.117 --> 03:47:51.578]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:47:51.738 --> 03:47:51.998]  Exactly.
[03:47:52.018 --> 03:47:56.181]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:47:56.321 --> 03:48:03.626]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:48:03.906 --> 03:48:04.347]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[03:48:10.706 --> 03:48:14.190]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[03:48:14.371 --> 03:48:17.675]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[03:48:17.735 --> 03:48:22.541]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[03:48:22.701 --> 03:48:25.524]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[03:48:25.584 --> 03:48:29.830]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule.
[03:48:30.410 --> 03:48:31.591]  Actions that we take.
[03:48:31.711 --> 03:48:35.293]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[03:48:35.733 --> 03:48:38.374]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[03:48:38.434 --> 03:48:46.939]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[03:48:47.967 --> 03:48:56.793]  is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[03:48:56.853 --> 03:49:01.977]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[03:49:02.497 --> 03:49:06.080]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[03:49:06.260 --> 03:49:08.281]  Is this global governance at last?
[03:49:08.382 --> 03:49:10.783]  Is it one world the central bank was in charge?
[03:49:10.843 --> 03:49:13.225]  Know your history and you will know your enemy.
[03:49:13.565 --> 03:49:16.007]  InfoWars.com I'm not
[03:49:16.347 --> 03:49:18.569]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[03:49:35.285 --> 03:49:38.068]  And then I learned the dirty tricks, the things they were doing to her.
[03:49:38.088 --> 03:49:40.051]  Uh, this is just crazy.
[03:49:40.091 --> 03:49:43.114]  We got LeeAnn Macklin and the other studio, David Knight, are gonna pop in.
[03:49:43.254 --> 03:49:45.016]  Ashley, what happened to you tonight?
[03:49:45.036 --> 03:49:49.641]  We already aired part of the report seeing this happen, but what in the world happened to these people?
[03:49:50.182 --> 03:49:52.904]  Wow Alex, I was really, really shocked tonight.
[03:49:52.964 --> 03:49:55.847]  I thought it was so disgusting the way that I was treated.
[03:49:56.247 --> 03:50:01.692]  I thought that I would go to the Democratic Debate Watch Party and it wouldn't be a problem.
[03:50:01.752 --> 03:50:09.019]  I thought that I would be able to speak with allies of the LGBT community and these other... We were going to show that we're not against them.
[03:50:09.159 --> 03:50:09.479]  Right.
[03:50:09.519 --> 03:50:10.620]  We were going to show what they had to say.
[03:50:10.860 --> 03:50:12.061]  I'm not against them at all.
[03:50:12.081 --> 03:50:13.142]  It should be inclusive.
[03:50:13.242 --> 03:50:20.569]  Yeah, I was just trying to ask them really, really simple questions like, what did you think about how Trump and Hillary performed in the debate tonight?
[03:50:20.890 --> 03:50:26.935]  And what I got was the most disgusting racial rhetoric I've ever received in my life.
[03:50:27.356 --> 03:50:31.920]  I was called an Uncle Tom tonight by a white male.
[03:50:32.320 --> 03:50:35.984]  This guy came up to me, this guy who's supposed to be- I'm not just bragging.
[03:50:36.184 --> 03:50:39.446]  I'm not trying to act tough, but I'd have punched him in his nose.
[03:50:39.466 --> 03:50:40.706]  Man, that's how I felt!
[03:50:41.066 --> 03:50:42.387]  Wow, so tell me what he did to you.
[03:50:42.687 --> 03:50:47.249]  Well, it really hurt me because this guy was simply just asking him about his shirt.
[03:50:47.549 --> 03:50:51.571]  He was wearing a Hillary shirt with these faces all over it of Hillary.
[03:50:51.831 --> 03:50:53.852]  Hillary and all her lies, I guess.
[03:50:54.233 --> 03:51:00.816]  And basically, he just came out of nowhere and said, how do you feel being an Uncle Tom?
[03:51:01.696 --> 03:51:02.416]  I was shocked.
[03:51:02.536 --> 03:51:03.617]  I was disgusted.
[03:51:03.637 --> 03:51:05.017]  So they feel empowered to be racist?
[03:51:05.037 --> 03:51:05.557]  Yeah, right.
[03:51:05.657 --> 03:51:06.178]  Exactly.
[03:51:06.278 --> 03:51:07.778]  It's all about racism.
[03:51:08.058 --> 03:51:18.041]  And that's what I really learned tonight is that Hillary Clinton supporters, as we've been saying it in FoWars, we've been telling you the truth about how Hillary Clinton is such a racist.
[03:51:18.502 --> 03:51:21.703]  I saw Hillary Clinton's America with Dinesh D'Souza.
[03:51:22.103 --> 03:51:25.024]  I saw the history of the Democratic Party.
[03:51:25.304 --> 03:51:28.325]  Did the Republicans attack you when you were in meetings with them?
[03:51:29.085 --> 03:51:29.666]  Not at all.
[03:51:29.726 --> 03:51:30.607]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:51:30.967 --> 03:51:31.788]  I talked to this guy.
[03:51:31.808 --> 03:51:33.149]  We've seen these cathartic events.
[03:51:33.169 --> 03:51:34.310]  Not that Republicans are perfect.
[03:51:34.450 --> 03:51:35.331]  The party's horrible.
[03:51:35.431 --> 03:51:35.871]  Exactly.
[03:51:35.912 --> 03:51:43.919]  But the point is, the people themselves, when actual African Americans show up at events, there's like crying and hugging and there's these cathartic events where everybody just wants to come together.
[03:51:44.219 --> 03:51:45.140]  Not with Democrats though.
[03:51:45.420 --> 03:51:46.762]  You follow their cult or it's over.
[03:51:47.270 --> 03:51:51.231]  Yeah, it's really, really sick because I've been to the Trump rallies here.
[03:51:51.291 --> 03:51:56.792]  I've talked to a lot of black Trump supporters and just generally Trump supporters, you know, out there.
[03:51:57.132 --> 03:51:58.452]  And they're so friendly.
[03:51:58.512 --> 03:51:59.472]  They're so nice.
[03:51:59.792 --> 03:52:00.892]  They're so giving.
[03:52:00.952 --> 03:52:02.133]  They're so open.
[03:52:02.413 --> 03:52:04.433]  They're just really, really friendly people.
[03:52:04.473 --> 03:52:11.014]  And then I go and talk to these Hillary Clinton supporters, and it was basically like the LGBT community attacking me.
[03:52:11.314 --> 03:52:16.475]  When I've been a friend, I've been an ally of the LGBT community for as long as I can remember.
[03:52:17.015 --> 03:52:18.897]  Yeah, they freaked me out.
[03:52:19.057 --> 03:52:19.718]  Yeah, well no, they did.
[03:52:19.738 --> 03:52:22.881]  They actually upset me to the point afterwards I was really upset.
[03:52:22.901 --> 03:52:23.721]  I was physically upset.
[03:52:23.762 --> 03:52:24.422]  I was crying.
[03:52:24.642 --> 03:52:25.003]  That's right.
[03:52:25.043 --> 03:52:26.164]  You got big guys in your face.
[03:52:41.718 --> 03:52:44.420]  Yeah, because I had big men in my face.
[03:52:44.740 --> 03:52:51.226]  I had a big old tall dude trying to tell me that I'm an Uncle Tom when he hasn't even read Harriet Beecher Stowe.
[03:52:51.506 --> 03:52:53.167]  He's never even heard of her, probably.
[03:52:53.207 --> 03:52:54.828]  He's just making up whatever he can say.
[03:52:55.129 --> 03:53:00.193]  And this is something that black people usually say amongst themselves, calling someone an Uncle Tom.
[03:53:00.533 --> 03:53:05.577]  So for him to say that to me, I thought that was even more racist than actually calling me the N-word.
[03:53:05.877 --> 03:53:09.880]  I had to call my mom and talk about it, and she thought it was so disgusting.
[03:53:09.940 --> 03:53:10.721]  She was shocked.
[03:53:11.021 --> 03:53:15.484]  That an actual white male said that to me, who's in support of Hillary Clinton.
[03:53:15.504 --> 03:53:19.367]  Well, you're a beautiful human being and he's an ugly piece of shit.
[03:53:19.387 --> 03:53:24.730]  And she's supposed to be the one, right, who's like all for the left ideology.
[03:53:24.770 --> 03:53:27.352]  She's the one who's for the LGBT community.
[03:53:27.632 --> 03:53:32.836]  And I didn't even get a chance to tell him about Saudi Arabia and all these other countries.
[03:53:32.856 --> 03:53:33.696]  The real oppression.
[03:53:33.736 --> 03:53:34.077]  Right.
[03:53:34.337 --> 03:53:36.158]  Where they throw gay people off buildings.
[03:53:36.198 --> 03:53:36.999]  They kill gay people.
[03:53:37.959 --> 03:53:43.504]  I mean, if they did indict that female cop that shot the innocent black father of four, I'd go riot in Tulsa.
[03:53:43.544 --> 03:53:44.405]  But they did indict him.
[03:53:44.645 --> 03:53:45.045]  Exactly.
[03:53:45.065 --> 03:53:45.566]  They did indict her.
[03:53:45.766 --> 03:53:46.686]  But no one cares.
[03:53:46.987 --> 03:53:48.948]  Where's Black Lives Matter when it comes to Tulsa?
[03:53:48.968 --> 03:53:51.070]  Because they want to just pick a case where they can fight all day.
[03:53:51.110 --> 03:53:51.891]  It's so evil.
[03:53:52.031 --> 03:53:52.311]  Yeah.
[03:53:52.451 --> 03:53:55.554]  So I just, I mean, we sent you there and I was like, well, okay.
[03:53:55.714 --> 03:53:57.395]  I told Duke, he's a great guy.
[03:53:57.415 --> 03:53:58.616]  I was like, we were invited.
[03:53:58.636 --> 03:53:59.277]  They're going to be nice.
[03:53:59.557 --> 03:54:02.599]  Because in my experience, Democrats are like piranhas.
[03:54:04.119 --> 03:54:09.002]  And the Republicans are pretty damn bad too, but I tell you, I just don't know what to say anymore.
[03:54:09.042 --> 03:54:11.603]  He literally attacked me and then ran away.
[03:54:11.683 --> 03:54:13.004]  He was such a coward.
[03:54:13.304 --> 03:54:14.425]  This is a grown man.
[03:54:14.465 --> 03:54:17.086]  This is a guy who's at least a decade older than me.
[03:54:17.446 --> 03:54:19.167]  He attacked me out of nowhere.
[03:54:19.227 --> 03:54:20.969]  He attacked and then he ran away.
[03:54:21.309 --> 03:54:23.010]  Like, it was so childish.
[03:54:23.110 --> 03:54:24.792]  It was really, really shocking.
[03:54:25.112 --> 03:54:27.594]  And very disgusting, as Trump would say.
[03:54:28.034 --> 03:54:33.278]  Trump really demolished Hillary tonight, and I think that that's what really triggered them tonight.
[03:54:33.298 --> 03:54:33.879]  They're scared.
[03:54:34.059 --> 03:54:35.180]  They were scared.
[03:54:35.480 --> 03:54:37.722]  They couldn't accept he had the black check.
[03:54:37.742 --> 03:54:39.363]  He did demolish her.
[03:54:39.603 --> 03:54:40.284]  I'm sorry.
[03:54:40.644 --> 03:54:42.005]  I mean, yeah, I wish he'd have been harder.
[03:54:42.185 --> 03:54:49.209]  Yeah, he should have been harder, but I truly believe that with his points, he made a lot of great points.
[03:54:49.249 --> 03:54:51.370]  So it's more chivalrous.
[03:54:51.450 --> 03:54:52.231]  Exactly.
[03:54:52.451 --> 03:55:00.556]  They were trying to say that he was really down on her and she's a woman and he shouldn't have been so hard on her, but he really wasn't.
[03:55:00.836 --> 03:55:02.357]  He wasn't hard on Hillary.
[03:55:02.677 --> 03:55:07.919]  He didn't hit her as hard as I would have wanted him to, but at the same time, he was respectful.
[03:55:08.219 --> 03:55:09.779]  He called her Senator Clinton.
[03:55:10.019 --> 03:55:11.800]  He called her Secretary Clinton.
[03:55:12.060 --> 03:55:14.041]  He was very, very respectful.
[03:55:14.381 --> 03:55:16.642]  So I don't see where- He took to high road.
[03:55:16.662 --> 03:55:17.782]  Did you see how she attacked?
[03:55:17.842 --> 03:55:18.162]  Right.
[03:55:18.702 --> 03:55:20.803]  Oh yeah, there was continuous attacks.
[03:55:21.143 --> 03:55:22.464]  Her and Lester Holt.
[03:55:22.804 --> 03:55:29.526]  They were both saying- I like Lester Holt, but I mean, Holt did throw like, he was unfair.
[03:55:30.026 --> 03:55:31.527]  He was completely unfair.
[03:55:31.607 --> 03:55:34.508]  He was worse than Rat Lauer, in my opinion.
[03:55:34.588 --> 03:55:35.968]  He was really, really bad.
[03:55:36.289 --> 03:55:45.832]  And it's easy to make him bad when you put a black face on that rhetoric, when you put a black face on that Democratic talking points.
[03:55:46.113 --> 03:55:51.875]  It makes it a lot easier for people who are afraid to object because it's a black person talking about it.
[03:55:52.717 --> 03:55:55.159]  And I'm just so sick of all this What Color We Are stuff.
[03:55:55.200 --> 03:55:59.604]  I just want them to stop putting cancer medicines and vaccines and GMO and chemtrailing.
[03:55:59.624 --> 03:56:00.465]  We're all being attacked.
[03:56:00.745 --> 03:56:01.566]  We're all under attack.
[03:56:01.586 --> 03:56:06.190]  They're bringing in, they're announcing nationwide no more humans driving cars in five years.
[03:56:06.290 --> 03:56:06.931]  I'm not saying that.
[03:56:06.991 --> 03:56:07.371]  They are.
[03:56:07.772 --> 03:56:09.493]  I mean, they're coming after us, folks.
[03:56:09.974 --> 03:56:11.636]  We got to come together and defeat this.
[03:56:12.036 --> 03:56:13.658]  And it's so obvious what they're doing to us.
[03:56:14.961 --> 03:56:16.702]  Alex, it was literally nuts.
[03:56:16.942 --> 03:56:27.850]  I had this woman who is a self-professed lesbian, and she was telling me that her wife, her black wife, is going to tell me about how I'm bad for supporting Trump.
[03:56:29.980 --> 03:56:35.463]  Put it out there when I said, hey, you just told me you're going to show me your black wife and tell me how I'm bad.
[03:56:35.723 --> 03:56:37.004]  Then she said, I never said that.
[03:56:37.544 --> 03:56:39.445]  It's just like, it's like twilight.
[03:56:39.525 --> 03:56:45.488]  As soon as you repeat to them exactly what they literally just said, they're just like, I never said that.
[03:56:46.469 --> 03:56:47.770]  They bought into a lie.
[03:56:47.790 --> 03:56:55.057]  It's like, I don't mean to use the Nazi thing, it's been overused, but the Germans launched all these wars, they got bought into it, and they bought it.
[03:56:55.537 --> 03:57:01.423]  Hitler won the first few rounds, then they attacked everybody, and even when Berlin was about to collapse, they still believed they were winning.
[03:57:01.683 --> 03:57:02.624]  Like Baghdad Bob.
[03:57:02.744 --> 03:57:07.489]  Yeah, he would even go to Bavaria, I think, where they were talking about retreating.
[03:57:07.990 --> 03:57:08.510]  Exactly.
[03:57:08.951 --> 03:57:10.072]  But the point is, they're delusional.
[03:57:10.652 --> 03:57:32.129]  And so the crazier, it's not that Republicans are good, it's not that there isn't race problems, it's like, you people have used this thing as your whack job excuse to do all this stuff, and now it's gotten so cuckoo that, you know, they're going, we can't show, if you see blonde people, I can't help that my hair was blonde, you know, go confront them because they're racist.
[03:57:32.509 --> 03:57:33.770]  It's like, what the hell?
[03:57:34.030 --> 03:57:38.454]  That's the most racist thing I've ever heard, and they're just teaching it, and it's like,
[03:57:39.918 --> 03:57:40.759]  It makes my head spin.
[03:57:40.939 --> 03:57:41.780]  I don't know where they're going next.
[03:57:41.800 --> 03:57:47.187]  I think the greatest flaw in the human mind, Alex, is the fact that we can rationalize bad behavior.
[03:57:47.207 --> 03:57:50.431]  Like you're talking about the Nazis.
[03:57:50.451 --> 03:57:54.095]  The Germans, the Nazis, they thought they were God's gift on Earth.
[03:57:54.135 --> 03:57:55.417]  They thought they were doing the right thing.
[03:57:55.517 --> 03:57:56.038]  Exactly.
[03:57:56.058 --> 03:57:56.979]  They rationalized it.
[03:57:56.999 --> 03:57:59.001]  And of the Republicans, I was a big enemy of Bush.
[03:57:59.722 --> 03:58:00.423]  I thought he was hard.
[03:58:00.523 --> 03:58:03.965]  Even liberal professors like Jonathan Turley say Obama's triple bad.
[03:58:04.445 --> 03:58:09.489]  Because he's got this cover so the liberals feel like they can do anything because they're the liberals.
[03:58:10.049 --> 03:58:12.991]  Well, you're not the liberals when you're arresting the press.
[03:58:13.011 --> 03:58:17.054]  You're not the liberals when you have the... It's like Snowden hated Bush when he saw it.
[03:58:17.314 --> 03:58:19.295]  Then Obama gets in, it gets worse!
[03:58:19.936 --> 03:58:22.498]  And they go, oh, you're just anti-Obama.
[03:58:22.858 --> 03:58:24.999]  No, it's that... Forget Obama.
[03:58:25.460 --> 03:58:27.021]  They put Obama in as their cover.
[03:58:27.549 --> 03:58:36.011]  I was proud that I was able to actually wake up some black people who were there at the Democratic watch party.
[03:58:36.111 --> 03:58:37.332]  That's why they got mad at you then?
[03:58:37.392 --> 03:58:37.872]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:58:37.912 --> 03:58:38.792]  Why did they get so mad at you?
[03:58:38.832 --> 03:58:44.874]  Right, well, they were so angry because number one, I'm not following, I'm not towing the party line.
[03:58:45.194 --> 03:58:54.318]  They expect you to just stay on that Democratic plantation, don't question anything, don't open your mind to any other beliefs or any other facts.
[03:58:54.978 --> 03:58:58.360]  In fact, they were laughing at Donald Trump when he came up with facts.
[03:58:58.720 --> 03:58:59.340]  David Knight.
[03:58:59.380 --> 03:59:02.561]  Yeah, I wanted to say, you got it exactly, Ashley.
[03:59:02.701 --> 03:59:04.542]  Stay on the Democrat plantation.
[03:59:04.562 --> 03:59:06.163]  I've got to say, you're in good company.
[03:59:06.643 --> 03:59:08.804]  They called Clarence Thomas an Uncle Tom.
[03:59:08.904 --> 03:59:09.244]  Why?
[03:59:09.684 --> 03:59:13.406]  Because he pushed back against the idea that government owns you.
[03:59:13.686 --> 03:59:16.466]  See, they think that they own black people, they think they own everyone.
[03:59:17.027 --> 03:59:23.968]  And the person who came really hard against Clarence Thomas was Joe Biden.
[03:59:24.328 --> 03:59:36.490]  And he came against him because he hated the idea, he was absolutely outraged that Clarence Thomas would talk about the idea that we have natural rights, that there are certain inalienable rights that we all possess as human beings, which is in the Declaration of Independence.
[03:59:36.830 --> 03:59:42.951]  Joe Biden thinks that they own you, the Democrats think they own you, and they will tell you what rights and what privileges you have.
[03:59:43.211 --> 03:59:54.197]  We've seen this with the Detroit church, where Donald Trump was talking to the church, and as they were giving him this mantle and a Bible and all that, they cut it off immediately because they can't have that.
[03:59:54.217 --> 04:00:01.841]  But look, look, it's like when you're telling the white and black lady, the human, that your wife's saying, hey, I didn't abort my child, she goes, you're a white savior.
[04:00:01.861 --> 04:00:02.642]  That's right.
[04:00:02.722 --> 04:00:05.483]  And she's like, well, my child's Asian, we'll see you're a white savior.
[04:00:05.683 --> 04:00:10.086]  Well, damn right, you could be black or white, you're a human, you are a savior, you saved a kid.
[04:00:10.426 --> 04:00:12.267]  The point is, humans can be saviors.
[04:00:12.947 --> 04:00:17.471]  It doesn't matter what color you are, and they're fundamentally saying you can't be a savior, David Knight.
[04:00:17.892 --> 04:00:20.014]  You're not allowed to not be racist.
[04:00:20.234 --> 04:00:21.736]  You're not allowed to reach out to people.
[04:00:21.916 --> 04:00:23.337]  You're not allowed to build a better world.
[04:00:23.617 --> 04:00:28.042]  You gotta follow our rules, and do what we say, and follow our system, and it makes me sick!
[04:00:28.482 --> 04:00:29.862]  These people are anti-human.
[04:00:30.222 --> 04:00:34.743]  So beyond race, they are anti-human, they are eugenicists, and they must fall.
[04:00:35.023 --> 04:00:35.643]  They must fail.
[04:00:35.864 --> 04:00:42.685]  And for all Donald Trump's failings, nobody's perfect, they hate him because he wants to actually turn humanity loose.
[04:00:43.005 --> 04:00:44.125]  And that's why they're so upset.
[04:00:44.425 --> 04:00:47.246]  That's why the spirit of the enemy hates Donald Trump.
[04:00:47.466 --> 04:00:52.227]  It brings tears to my eyes to think about this epic battle we're involved in, where they always tell us...
[04:00:53.197 --> 04:00:54.118]  You're not for real.
[04:00:54.378 --> 04:00:55.378]  You're not sincere.
[04:00:55.398 --> 04:00:56.459]  You're this and that.
[04:00:57.159 --> 04:00:58.000]  I am sincere.
[04:00:58.420 --> 04:00:59.681]  I do want prosperity.
[04:01:00.021 --> 04:01:01.722]  I do want everybody to be successful.
[04:01:02.062 --> 04:01:03.463]  I do care about everybody.
[04:01:04.003 --> 04:01:05.784]  I am not what you say I am.
[04:01:06.064 --> 04:01:07.445]  I will not take these labels.
[04:01:07.725 --> 04:01:09.006]  I am not going to accept it.
[04:01:09.906 --> 04:01:15.770]  Alex, you know, the most degrading thing that you can do to an individual is deny their ability to think for themselves.
[04:01:15.890 --> 04:01:18.632]  Because when people can't think for themselves, they're dehumanized.
[04:01:18.652 --> 04:01:19.413]  That's it!
[04:01:19.453 --> 04:01:21.834]  That's why Hillary says, you'll take my labels.
[04:01:22.314 --> 04:01:24.756]  The Washington Post, you won't call us media!
[04:01:24.816 --> 04:01:27.718]  Yeah, because you can only advance statism if you have collectivism.
[04:01:27.938 --> 04:01:32.281]  And collectivism is directly contrary to human... True diversity is individualism.
[04:01:32.441 --> 04:01:34.082]  Yeah, it's directly contrary to you.
[04:01:34.122 --> 04:01:39.885]  We do what we want, that changes the world through our own personal decisions.
[04:01:40.305 --> 04:01:42.707]  If you question them, they call you deplorable, they call you racist.
[04:01:42.727 --> 04:01:46.709]  They don't want to support anyone having a unique human thought.
[04:01:47.089 --> 04:01:50.631]  Like you said, it's all about staying on that democratic plantation.
[04:01:51.011 --> 04:01:55.974]  Like Barack Obama said, he's going to be disappointed in you black people, you better vote for Hillary!
[04:01:56.354 --> 04:01:58.456]  He's going to be disappointed, even though
[04:01:59.036 --> 04:02:02.959]  Look back at 2008-2007 when he was so down on her.
[04:02:03.039 --> 04:02:07.222]  Look at all the things that Barack Obama said about Hillary when she was running.
[04:02:07.282 --> 04:02:07.802]  Exactly.
[04:02:07.882 --> 04:02:13.186]  And it doesn't matter if the Republicans are probably horrible too, we gotta keep them honest.
[04:02:13.486 --> 04:02:15.908]  It's a rejection of what the power structure wants.
[04:02:15.928 --> 04:02:20.111]  And I'll say this, not because Barack Obama's part African, but it's true, he's less evil than Hillary.
[04:02:20.451 --> 04:02:23.634]  When you look at Hillary, it's true, she is evil.
[04:02:23.834 --> 04:02:24.815]  She is evil.
[04:02:25.555 --> 04:02:27.316]  That's why I was trying to get across to people.
[04:02:27.636 --> 04:02:29.657]  I tried to tell them about Margaret Sanger.
[04:02:29.957 --> 04:02:32.379]  I tried to tell them about Senator Robert Byrd.
[04:02:32.659 --> 04:02:45.125]  I tried to tell the black people, and some of them I did wake up with the things that I was letting them know, but the bottom line is this, like, they want to hold on to that Democratic life raft, like, you know, it's going to save them.
[04:02:45.145 --> 04:02:49.449]  People are so delusional that a lot of the Hillary voters now, they're not pro-Hillary.
[04:02:49.529 --> 04:02:52.933]  I mean, like we've said before, we're having so much problem finding Hillary supporters.
[04:02:53.153 --> 04:02:55.035]  They're voting Hillary now because they're anti-Trump.
[04:02:55.055 --> 04:02:56.076]  Because they're so delusional.
[04:02:56.116 --> 04:03:00.560]  But they don't realize that everything they claim Trump is, Hillary's been for 30 years.
[04:03:01.321 --> 04:03:03.864]  We are four hours and four minutes into this transmission.
[04:03:04.805 --> 04:03:06.967]  Wes, in the back there, was showing me on the computer.
[04:03:07.007 --> 04:03:07.788]  He said, look at this.
[04:03:08.088 --> 04:03:08.949]  I'm not exaggerating.
[04:03:10.170 --> 04:03:12.473]  We have 20 phone lines when we do a digital call.
[04:03:12.953 --> 04:03:13.914]  GCN has six.
[04:03:13.974 --> 04:03:15.936]  They're analog, and that's what I've used for 20 years.
[04:03:15.956 --> 04:03:17.078]  I never expanded it.
[04:03:18.039 --> 04:03:20.081]  Wes was showing me, and I said, put a camera on that.
[04:03:20.101 --> 04:03:20.561]  He said, we can't.
[04:03:20.581 --> 04:03:21.362]  There's phone numbers on it.
[04:03:23.302 --> 04:03:26.945]  We were having a thousand phone calls a minute.
[04:03:28.045 --> 04:03:28.706]  Wow!
[04:03:28.746 --> 04:03:34.530]  So, I mean, to give you an idea of what's calling in, tens of thousands every ten minutes.
[04:03:35.331 --> 04:03:37.092]  So, we've got
[04:03:38.661 --> 04:03:46.186]  O'Brien, Habu, Jane, Jonathan, Sam, Aaron, Mike, Brad, Cowboy, Jeff, Scott, Michael.
[04:03:46.546 --> 04:03:51.429]  That's only the first ten calls of thousands we're trying to take.
[04:03:51.449 --> 04:03:53.250]  I am so... Let me explain something.
[04:03:53.730 --> 04:03:55.671]  I don't... I'm a private person.
[04:03:55.691 --> 04:03:56.612]  I don't want to be out in crowds.
[04:03:56.632 --> 04:03:57.573]  I don't want to be left alone.
[04:03:57.633 --> 04:04:02.896]  I don't need... I don't... But I'm so humbled by these people that call here.
[04:04:03.999 --> 04:04:08.222]  And they thank us on air, and it's like torture, because thanking me?
[04:04:08.462 --> 04:04:10.043]  I'm in a fight for my family.
[04:04:10.063 --> 04:04:13.625]  I am so honored to know these people that want freedom.
[04:04:14.045 --> 04:04:15.386]  They shouldn't be thanking me.
[04:04:15.926 --> 04:04:16.586]  We're together.
[04:04:16.987 --> 04:04:21.229]  Because you've done so much, and people feel so disempowered.
[04:04:21.289 --> 04:04:25.952]  No, I know, but I'm just saying, I agree, but they are as important as us, is what I'm telling you.
[04:04:26.052 --> 04:04:26.652]  Oh, I know.
[04:04:26.792 --> 04:04:27.653]  I know that they are.
[04:04:28.193 --> 04:04:28.754]  Yeah, I know.
[04:04:28.774 --> 04:04:29.474]  I know you know that.
[04:04:29.534 --> 04:04:32.336]  I'm just saying, it's like... Yeah.
[04:04:33.618 --> 04:04:34.219]  It's humbling.
[04:04:34.499 --> 04:04:37.783]  They shouldn't, exactly, they shouldn't thank me for trying to defeat this.
[04:04:38.144 --> 04:04:38.344]  Right.
[04:04:38.364 --> 04:04:39.245]  This is survival.
[04:04:39.465 --> 04:04:39.826]  Right.
[04:04:40.587 --> 04:04:43.630]  This isn't some thing you get a crown for.
[04:04:43.650 --> 04:04:44.191]  Right.
[04:04:44.211 --> 04:04:45.573]  This is everything we are.
[04:04:45.893 --> 04:04:46.414]  Exactly.
[04:04:46.734 --> 04:04:47.615]  Everything we'll ever be.
[04:04:47.916 --> 04:04:48.596]  Our birthright.
[04:04:48.616 --> 04:04:49.057]  I mean...
[04:04:50.242 --> 04:04:55.245]  The globalists have turned themselves over to the devil itself to hurt humanity to control it.
[04:04:55.585 --> 04:04:58.146]  That's the ultimate sin, to dumb somebody down.
[04:04:58.386 --> 04:05:02.308]  It's like taking a three-year-old child and not teaching him, but throwing him over a cliff.
[04:05:02.609 --> 04:05:02.829]  Right.
[04:05:02.869 --> 04:05:03.869]  That's not elitism.
[04:05:04.429 --> 04:05:05.190]  That's satanic.
[04:05:05.590 --> 04:05:06.010]  Exactly.
[04:05:06.050 --> 04:05:09.852]  So I'm here to try to release all the secrets.
[04:05:11.053 --> 04:05:11.233]  Right.
[04:05:11.313 --> 04:05:12.694]  I'm here to run over the enemy.
[04:05:13.715 --> 04:05:17.538]  I have prayed to God to give us the strength, and I believe we have it.
[04:05:18.358 --> 04:05:22.721]  And the providence we have proven by what we've done shows we're on the right path.
[04:05:23.502 --> 04:05:28.045]  And I'm so emotional whenever we get to this point, because this is historic, what's happening.
[04:05:28.085 --> 04:05:32.988]  And they want you to lose that dream, lose that beauty, and not understand how great this is.
[04:05:33.248 --> 04:05:34.809]  I know Leanne's in the studio, David Knight.
[04:05:36.030 --> 04:05:39.998]  Pop in for a minute, we'll take like 10 calls and shut the transmission down because we have a limited crew.
[04:05:40.018 --> 04:05:40.759]  We gotta go to bed.
[04:05:41.060 --> 04:05:42.523]  We gotta get up tomorrow and do it all again.
[04:05:42.803 --> 04:05:43.905]  But this is history happening.
[04:05:44.653 --> 04:05:51.939]  You know, Alex, when I took an astronomy class, the teacher taught me that there's actually planets out there that are probably full of diamonds.
[04:05:52.520 --> 04:05:58.705]  Like, diamonds, like, they're so rare on planet Earth, but they're probably totally common in the universe.
[04:05:59.666 --> 04:06:05.291]  And then I saw this article about Stephen Hawking today said that humanity is not going to last unless we go to space.
[04:06:05.792 --> 04:06:05.952]  Right.
[04:06:06.272 --> 04:06:11.674]  So that's what bothers me about globalism, is that they keep us on this whole medieval plantation.
[04:06:11.694 --> 04:06:12.215]  Right.
[04:06:12.355 --> 04:06:13.555]  There's a pressing one as well.
[04:06:13.575 --> 04:06:14.596]  Neoliberalism, right.
[04:06:15.176 --> 04:06:16.737]  But they've got the stars.
[04:06:16.757 --> 04:06:18.077]  Go ahead, sorry.
[04:06:18.898 --> 04:06:25.301]  Well yeah, it says they keep us here on this medieval thought wave as if this is all we are, this is all we have.
[04:06:25.401 --> 04:06:29.883]  Meanwhile, they're already working on the plans to inhabit space.
[04:06:30.083 --> 04:06:31.663]  They're already working on their escape.
[04:06:31.804 --> 04:06:32.664]  Yeah, Elysium.
[04:06:33.444 --> 04:06:33.584]  Right.
[04:06:35.694 --> 04:06:41.339]  Well, Ashley, I just wanted to give you a round of applause and commend you for being out there being so brave.
[04:06:41.740 --> 04:06:44.222]  And I think this is going to give an opportunity.
[04:06:44.422 --> 04:06:54.392]  This is an opportunity for everyone out there at InfoWars to see exactly who you are and why you're so strong and why you why you've been brought on the team and you're already dominating.
[04:06:55.272 --> 04:07:10.299]  I'd love to have you on the show tomorrow on the Nightly News for a whole segment breaking down what happened and just like you were able to wake up a lot of black people there at that Democratic Party, maybe you could do a whole report on this and just tell the world, wake up!
[04:07:10.559 --> 04:07:18.943]  So many people need to hear this because I'm so sick and tired of hearing, I follow a lot of black people on Twitter and you see this a lot.
[04:07:19.103 --> 04:07:22.445]  It's Coon, it's Uncle Tom and it's just this like
[04:07:22.785 --> 04:07:27.088]  How many more decades is this going to be the thing to- There's always racism if you're anti-communist.
[04:07:27.128 --> 04:07:28.369]  It's like, it's acceptable.
[04:07:28.489 --> 04:07:29.289]  I'm tired of it.
[04:07:29.329 --> 04:07:30.250]  It's not acceptable.
[04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:33.532]  There's so much racism within the black community.
[04:07:33.552 --> 04:07:37.595]  And it definitely has to do with your skin tone, your skin color.
[04:07:38.015 --> 04:07:42.138]  And that's what happened tonight is this woman, she had a much lighter skin tone than me.
[04:07:42.498 --> 04:07:50.524]  And her white wife was trying to tell me that I wasn't black because- Well let me just say, I like the fact that you got darker skin tone.
[04:07:51.144 --> 04:07:52.185]  I like it too, Alex.
[04:07:54.266 --> 04:07:57.548]  But the bottom line is this, you know, I'm not afraid to go out there.
[04:07:57.568 --> 04:08:02.170]  I'm not afraid to talk to these BLM people, the socialists and everything, you know.
[04:08:02.490 --> 04:08:04.191]  Some of these have been my friends.
[04:08:04.211 --> 04:08:07.233]  I mean, you had liberals saying, shut up, you got dark skin.
[04:08:07.433 --> 04:08:07.733]  Yeah.
[04:08:09.634 --> 04:08:13.156]  I'm glad you held back.
[04:08:13.236 --> 04:08:14.396]  I know!
[04:08:14.836 --> 04:08:21.459]  No, I definitely had to hold back, man, because Alex, really, they definitely triggered me tonight.
[04:08:21.479 --> 04:08:22.840]  I literally had to hold back.
[04:08:22.960 --> 04:08:30.843]  They've gotten me on video, you know, because I was very, very angry with them and what they said and what they did to me.
[04:08:30.903 --> 04:08:32.244]  They were disgusting.
[04:08:32.284 --> 04:08:32.984]  They were rude.
[04:08:33.284 --> 04:08:34.465]  They were atrocious tonight.
[04:08:34.485 --> 04:08:35.225]  They were hypocrites.
[04:08:35.305 --> 04:08:36.186]  They were hypocrites.
[04:08:36.226 --> 04:08:37.326]  They were very vitriolic.
[04:08:37.346 --> 04:08:59.625]  Here's the thing that's so funny, not funny, they're always kind of saying how white people aren't allowed to say anything because, you know, we're the privileged class, but this gentleman was part of a victim group, you know, they don't have the status, because he's part of the LGBT group, so, you know, he felt like he could call you that, because, I mean, that's just where these labels are.
[04:08:59.645 --> 04:09:02.047]  They're a liberal group, they can act like a bunch of racist assholes.
[04:09:02.287 --> 04:09:04.309]  Yeah, I have two victimhood points.
[04:09:04.689 --> 04:09:14.398]  Being a black female, you know, I have black and I have female, so you should know, as a white male, you only have one point of victimhood.
[04:09:14.438 --> 04:09:15.940]  Even when it comes to social justice.
[04:09:24.187 --> 04:09:25.468]  You know, prison.
[04:09:25.708 --> 04:09:27.610]  We want to break out of that.
[04:09:27.770 --> 04:09:32.533]  And the sad thing is, Ashley, this would have happened in any town USA.
[04:09:33.033 --> 04:09:35.335]  It wouldn't have been just liberal Austin, Texas.
[04:09:35.435 --> 04:09:37.817]  We've seen this behavior from coast to coast.
[04:09:38.317 --> 04:09:40.839]  We've seen the anti-Trump rallies.
[04:09:41.179 --> 04:09:43.921]  And you were saying how you talk to a lot of Trump supporters.
[04:09:44.362 --> 04:09:47.424]  And all across the board, they are the most polite.
[04:09:47.624 --> 04:09:48.925]  They're the most patriotic.
[04:09:49.325 --> 04:09:50.686]  They're the most hard-working.
[04:09:50.966 --> 04:09:54.149]  The people inside the Trump rallies are just good people.
[04:09:54.169 --> 04:09:57.851]  I grew up around liberal conservative Republicans.
[04:09:58.552 --> 04:10:02.734]  And it was literally, we're guilty, we're bad, we've got to build a new world.
[04:10:03.275 --> 04:10:04.456]  And then I run around Democrats.
[04:10:04.476 --> 04:10:05.656]  It's like the most racist crap I've ever heard.
[04:10:05.897 --> 04:10:10.500]  So that's why I grew up like saying, I'm the big racist, but the Democrats are like, ah, we do all this.
[04:10:10.940 --> 04:10:13.182]  And I'm not saying Republicans are perfect, they're bad at the top.
[04:10:13.502 --> 04:10:14.963]  But there's absolutely a paradigm here.
[04:10:14.983 --> 04:10:15.643]  Bring in other points.
[04:10:15.663 --> 04:10:16.384]  I'm going to go to these calls.
[04:10:16.604 --> 04:10:27.449]  Well, and then you look at the other side, outside of the Trump rallies, where there's anti-Trump protesters, they will yell and cuss at you in front of your wife and your children.
[04:10:28.049 --> 04:10:29.670]  They will throw eggs at women.
[04:10:30.110 --> 04:10:31.451]  They will key your cars.
[04:10:31.911 --> 04:10:33.432]  They will slash your tires.
[04:10:33.892 --> 04:10:35.412]  They will shoot guns in the air.
[04:10:35.833 --> 04:10:36.813]  I mean, they're animals.
[04:10:37.293 --> 04:10:43.196]  And this is really an illustration of what we're up against, and this is what we're up against right now.
[04:10:43.356 --> 04:10:51.571]  This is Hillary versus Trump, and this is the split of the nation, and a perfect example is what was showcased tonight with Ashley Beckford.
[04:10:51.772 --> 04:10:53.014]  Powerful.
[04:10:53.054 --> 04:10:55.058]  Now, Darren, those are peaceful protests.
[04:10:55.098 --> 04:10:55.398]  Come on.
[04:10:57.185 --> 04:10:59.046]  Oh, this crew has been up for 18 hours.
[04:10:59.066 --> 04:11:00.367]  I want to take some phone calls now.
[04:11:00.888 --> 04:11:08.713]  O'Brien, Habu, Joanne, Jonathan, Sam, Aaron, Mike, Brad, Cowboy, Jeff, Scott, Michael.
[04:11:08.733 --> 04:11:10.134]  And I'm not exaggerating.
[04:11:10.194 --> 04:11:10.774]  Wes showed me.
[04:11:10.814 --> 04:11:13.636]  It was like a thousand phone calls a minute coming in.
[04:11:13.896 --> 04:11:14.897]  It was like so fast.
[04:11:14.917 --> 04:11:16.518]  It was like huge.
[04:11:16.538 --> 04:11:19.440]  Just like tell everyone we love them so much.
[04:11:19.680 --> 04:11:20.461]  We love you all.
[04:11:20.501 --> 04:11:23.743]  Thank you so much for calling in and watching us and sticking with us.
[04:11:23.803 --> 04:11:26.525]  Talk show host begged for calls.
[04:11:27.025 --> 04:11:29.626]  I mean, I'm not bragging, but Liberty is popular.
[04:11:29.766 --> 04:11:30.927]  We will get to you next time.
[04:11:30.947 --> 04:11:33.028]  This is very ungenerous.
[04:11:33.088 --> 04:11:36.210]  When I was there, locally here in Austin, they knew us.
[04:11:36.910 --> 04:11:38.571]  So, and they were queuing up.
[04:11:38.651 --> 04:11:42.753]  I couldn't interview, you know, enough people before the psychos started attacking me.
[04:11:43.073 --> 04:11:45.294]  Well, that's why they're mad, because they know you're the real liberal.
[04:11:45.354 --> 04:11:47.475]  I can't wait to see the rest of the reports.
[04:11:47.555 --> 04:11:48.816]  Anybody pop in during these calls.
[04:11:49.536 --> 04:11:52.738]  O'Brien in Maryland, top caller, been holding 32 minutes.
[04:11:52.798 --> 04:11:53.598]  You're on the air.
[04:11:53.618 --> 04:11:54.959]  Go ahead, O'Brien in Maryland.
[04:11:56.192 --> 04:11:56.492]  Yes.
[04:11:56.992 --> 04:12:01.155]  I would like to say that Trump did very good in the debate.
[04:12:01.395 --> 04:12:08.539]  He basically ultimately destroyed Hillary, but not as... Let me say this.
[04:12:08.599 --> 04:12:09.659]  Are you on a speakerphone?
[04:12:10.620 --> 04:12:11.200]  No, I'm not.
[04:12:11.240 --> 04:12:11.860]  All right.
[04:12:11.900 --> 04:12:12.561]  It's a little bit echoey.
[04:12:12.601 --> 04:12:13.701]  Everybody get on speakerphones.
[04:12:14.062 --> 04:12:14.802]  Back off a little bit.
[04:12:14.822 --> 04:12:16.303]  I want to hear you say Trump destroyed Hillary.
[04:12:19.585 --> 04:12:23.967]  Well, basically what I was trying to say is that Trump destroyed Hillary.
[04:12:25.014 --> 04:12:26.337]  I don't know.
[04:12:36.607 --> 04:12:41.490]  That's a good point.
[04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:42.191]  God bless you.
[04:12:42.211 --> 04:12:42.751]  Thank you, sir.
[04:12:42.811 --> 04:12:43.291]  Great point.
[04:12:43.711 --> 04:12:46.993]  No, I mean, we can sit here as hardcore awake people and say, be more hardcore.
[04:12:47.013 --> 04:12:47.514]  She's a demon.
[04:12:47.534 --> 04:12:49.275]  But Trump's pretty smart.
[04:12:50.035 --> 04:12:50.835]  Was he smart?
[04:12:50.855 --> 04:12:53.297]  Because I don't want to sit here like, oh, I know everything.
[04:12:53.317 --> 04:12:53.877]  He knows nothing.
[04:12:54.217 --> 04:12:55.378]  To be a little nicer to her?
[04:12:56.439 --> 04:12:57.679]  Yes, of course he was.
[04:12:59.212 --> 04:13:00.173]  Are you talking to the caller?
[04:13:00.193 --> 04:13:01.173]  No, I'm asking you.
[04:13:01.334 --> 04:13:08.919]  Yeah, no, of course he was smarter at being nicer to her because if he wasn't, then they would just added that to the list.
[04:13:08.959 --> 04:13:11.781]  Like, oh, here's Trump again being sexist.
[04:13:12.041 --> 04:13:12.662]  Here's Trump.
[04:13:12.682 --> 04:13:15.064]  He's bad because he's attacking a woman.
[04:13:15.384 --> 04:13:19.046]  And that's what the people were saying to me after the debate and even during the debate.
[04:13:19.367 --> 04:13:23.290]  They were saying, oh, we wondered if Trump was going to be softer on her because she was a woman.
[04:13:23.530 --> 04:13:24.951]  I guess he was a little softer.
[04:13:25.291 --> 04:13:26.292]  And it's just like, no.
[04:13:26.852 --> 04:13:28.634]  He doesn't need to be softer on her.
[04:13:28.714 --> 04:13:30.977]  They're both going for the same position.
[04:13:31.337 --> 04:13:33.279]  He was not hard enough on her.
[04:13:33.700 --> 04:13:42.830]  I believe he could have gone harder, but the American people won't accept it because so many people, they were just laughing like hyenas at Schultz Garden, the oldest business in Texas.
[04:13:43.090 --> 04:13:45.092]  No, they're like part of the trending culture.
[04:13:45.132 --> 04:13:45.653]  Yeah, right.
[04:13:45.673 --> 04:13:46.814]  They want to be part of the culture.
[04:13:47.114 --> 04:13:47.634]  Absolutely.
[04:13:47.654 --> 04:13:50.455]  Well, did you hear what Hillary said when she was trying to jab Trump?
[04:13:50.495 --> 04:13:57.376]  She's like, he dares to say that women only deserve equal pay if they do as good a job as men.
[04:13:57.396 --> 04:13:58.236]  It's like, what?
[04:13:58.436 --> 04:14:01.317]  Well, yeah, you have to do as good of a job.
[04:14:01.337 --> 04:14:03.097]  Trump is known for promoting women more.
[04:14:03.137 --> 04:14:04.038]  He's gotten awards.
[04:14:04.698 --> 04:14:06.278]  All he cares about is the results.
[04:14:06.538 --> 04:14:07.598]  She played the victim.
[04:14:07.618 --> 04:14:09.279]  Totally.
[04:14:09.319 --> 04:14:10.499]  You think Trump played the victim?
[04:14:11.314 --> 04:14:13.275]  Hillary played the victim.
[04:14:13.615 --> 04:14:15.296]  And Trump couldn't give her all the zingers.
[04:14:15.376 --> 04:14:18.818]  And the truth is, he's known for being like super liberal.
[04:14:19.298 --> 04:14:28.482]  That's why a lot of conservatives were right to say, hey, he's like for LGBT inclusiveness, he hires all these people.
[04:14:28.622 --> 04:14:32.404]  We don't hear about Trump being racist until he enters the election against Hillary.
[04:14:32.544 --> 04:14:33.264]  Exactly.
[04:14:33.325 --> 04:14:35.426]  That is the only time people started claiming that.
[04:14:35.466 --> 04:14:37.086]  He just doesn't want to screw us on trade.
[04:14:37.507 --> 04:14:38.327]  That's where they're pissed.
[04:14:38.607 --> 04:14:44.292]  And even some of the people knew about her hugging and kissing Robert Byrd and being at his funeral and everything.
[04:14:44.652 --> 04:14:46.854]  And it's just like, well, you don't care?
[04:14:46.914 --> 04:14:51.317]  You don't care that she's literally loving on a KKK Grand Dragon?
[04:14:51.337 --> 04:14:53.139]  And let me tell you my experiences with the KKK.
[04:14:53.559 --> 04:14:55.521]  I was out of high school for one year as I got in trouble.
[04:14:55.541 --> 04:14:56.562]  I was sent to work at a ranch.
[04:14:57.122 --> 04:14:59.443]  And, I mean, the KKK would, like, harass me routinely.
[04:14:59.803 --> 04:15:00.443]  Like a gang.
[04:15:00.643 --> 04:15:03.204]  I mean, you're out with a hot-looking girl, they'd harass you.
[04:15:03.504 --> 04:15:04.764]  It's like, what is this guy?
[04:15:04.805 --> 04:15:06.745]  This is like a serious demon club.
[04:15:06.765 --> 04:15:08.386]  All right, great points, caller.
[04:15:08.686 --> 04:15:13.307]  Habu in Wisconsin, you're on the air with our crew tonight, bringing live coverage.
[04:15:13.327 --> 04:15:13.827]  Thank you, sir.
[04:15:13.867 --> 04:15:15.308]  Go ahead.
[04:15:15.588 --> 04:15:18.789]  Thank you so much for the courtesy and kudos to InfoWars.
[04:15:20.289 --> 04:15:22.290]  I'm right with you guys all the way.
[04:15:22.730 --> 04:15:24.871]  Just a couple of quick points and observations.
[04:15:25.675 --> 04:15:29.456]  I'm not going to comment on the debate itself.
[04:15:29.936 --> 04:15:32.776]  It's been discussed amply on your panel.
[04:15:33.276 --> 04:15:34.877]  But just two very quick points.
[04:15:35.537 --> 04:15:42.478]  One, you know, ISIS has become the touchstone of all these talking heads who don't know squat.
[04:15:42.978 --> 04:15:44.258]  ISIS isn't anything.
[04:15:44.318 --> 04:15:44.998]  It's an ant.
[04:15:45.678 --> 04:15:54.320]  It is because, you know, Iraq has been dominated by the Shia government and Iran, and what it's done is it effectively has
[04:15:55.131 --> 04:15:57.612]  Uh, completely capped out the Sunnis.
[04:15:57.772 --> 04:16:05.316]  By the way, I'm not Sunni or have any connection to that part of the world, but this is what they're doing and they were fighting back and... No, I mean, I agree.
[04:16:05.656 --> 04:16:07.917]  They let the Shiites take over Iraq.
[04:16:08.217 --> 04:16:09.598]  That stirred up Saudi Arabia.
[04:16:09.618 --> 04:16:11.539]  So what do you think geopolitically is going on?
[04:16:14.318 --> 04:16:17.240]  You know, if there isn't justice, there never is peace.
[04:16:17.540 --> 04:16:18.961]  So this is what has to be addressed.
[04:16:19.502 --> 04:16:23.465]  And the second thing, listen, I don't want to, I'm just mindful of the time.
[04:16:23.505 --> 04:16:24.505]  I don't want to answer that.
[04:16:24.806 --> 04:16:26.487]  I'm sure you can, in your time, do that.
[04:16:26.987 --> 04:16:33.792]  The second thing, and this is probably a more, this is a point that could come to haunt Trump.
[04:16:35.654 --> 04:16:38.816]  The host, being part of the mainstream media,
[04:16:39.432 --> 04:16:45.299]  Only ask questions that would be against Trump, that would effectively favor Hillary.
[04:16:45.519 --> 04:16:49.844]  And you as much mentioned this, that Lester Holt was... No, I don't like Lester Holt.
[04:16:49.924 --> 04:16:50.905]  I was really surprised.
[04:16:50.946 --> 04:16:51.847]  He really went after him.
[04:16:53.052 --> 04:16:53.953]  His job was on the line.
[04:16:54.333 --> 04:16:56.935]  Yeah, it was almost like they blackmailed him, maybe.
[04:16:56.975 --> 04:17:00.799]  Lester Holt asked questions that were straight out of the Clinton campaign handbook.
[04:17:01.159 --> 04:17:05.383]  I mean, he asked Donald Trump about... Yeah, well, give us your income tax, because she won't release anything.
[04:17:05.483 --> 04:17:10.607]  Yeah, he's asking her about, asking Trump about income tax, but he didn't ask her about the email scandal.
[04:17:10.647 --> 04:17:12.029]  He didn't know what he said six months ago.
[04:17:12.209 --> 04:17:12.889]  He brought up the birther.
[04:17:12.909 --> 04:17:14.331]  She releases her foundations, I'll release this.
[04:17:14.651 --> 04:17:15.932]  Exactly, he should have said that.
[04:17:17.510 --> 04:17:19.211]  Hopefully he's saving it for the next debate.
[04:17:19.271 --> 04:17:24.273]  However, this was like the most-watched Super Bowl-level rating here.
[04:17:24.293 --> 04:17:24.873]  80 to 100 million.
[04:17:24.893 --> 04:17:26.333]  Most important 90 minutes.
[04:17:26.353 --> 04:17:26.934]  Do we know yet?
[04:17:27.374 --> 04:17:28.654]  I hadn't seen anything yet, Alex.
[04:17:28.774 --> 04:17:30.275]  I believe it was 100 million.
[04:17:30.455 --> 04:17:31.755]  Let's pull up DrugsReport.com.
[04:17:31.775 --> 04:17:32.416]  I bet he has it.
[04:17:32.716 --> 04:17:39.358]  Yeah, because Lester Holt said his knees were buckling because he had heard there was 100 million people tuning in.
[04:17:39.718 --> 04:17:39.959]  Wow.
[04:17:40.119 --> 04:17:40.399]  Yeah.
[04:17:41.059 --> 04:17:43.360]  Well, I mean, I said I believed in Lester.
[04:17:43.400 --> 04:17:46.161]  I got to say that the last moderator did a better job.
[04:17:47.356 --> 04:17:50.340]  I mean, I couldn't believe it.
[04:17:50.520 --> 04:17:53.263]  I mean, Holt just kept hammering Trump.
[04:17:53.764 --> 04:18:00.171]  One thing I noticed, Alex, is that Trump would interject on Hillary.
[04:18:00.251 --> 04:18:02.914]  Hillary would not interject on Trump because she liked the energy for it.
[04:18:02.974 --> 04:18:04.156]  Lester had to do it for her.
[04:18:04.176 --> 04:18:06.418]  So it was almost like she was basically
[04:18:08.234 --> 04:18:09.675]  You know, the surrogate nurse, you know what I mean?
[04:18:10.195 --> 04:18:10.635]  Oh, I agree.
[04:18:10.675 --> 04:18:12.235]  I kept wondering if she would just sit there.
[04:18:12.595 --> 04:18:30.941]  Well, and that's something that they say that they, you know, as people who are seasoned moderators, they really prefer that the opponent interrupt, you know, if they disagree with whatever their opponent is saying, that they prefer that they interrupt and let the moderator only interrupt in, you know, extreme circumstances.
[04:18:31.261 --> 04:18:34.382]  And Lester was kind of being her... Surrogate.
[04:18:34.442 --> 04:18:34.862]  Surrogate.
[04:18:34.942 --> 04:18:35.422]  Attack dog.
[04:18:35.962 --> 04:18:39.364]  Yeah, I mean Lester really... Don't you think it's so corrupt though?
[04:18:39.384 --> 04:18:44.626]  Yeah, he said let's stick to the facts when Trump was simply just trying to, you know, spread the facts.
[04:18:44.686 --> 04:18:48.548]  Hillary has all these bank accounts in other countries and won't release it?
[04:18:48.588 --> 04:18:48.928]  It's crazy.
[04:18:48.968 --> 04:18:49.928]  Let's go to some more phone calls.
[04:18:49.988 --> 04:18:50.809]  Abu, great points.
[04:18:51.629 --> 04:18:52.469]  David Knight, you want to pop in?
[04:18:53.570 --> 04:18:55.711]  It's not there?
[04:18:56.411 --> 04:18:58.032]  Alright, we'll go back to him in a minute.
[04:18:58.892 --> 04:19:01.233]  Alright, I can barely read this from this business.
[04:19:01.814 --> 04:19:02.294]  Joanna.
[04:19:02.554 --> 04:19:04.575]  Joanna from New Jersey, you're on the air, go ahead.
[04:19:06.215 --> 04:19:07.796]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[04:19:07.816 --> 04:19:08.956]  I'm a little bit nervous.
[04:19:09.036 --> 04:19:11.157]  I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.
[04:19:11.837 --> 04:19:17.119]  Number one, I want to say I'm absolutely shocked that Hillary could even do the debate.
[04:19:17.299 --> 04:19:18.400]  Yeah, no, I was proven wrong.
[04:19:18.460 --> 04:19:19.460]  I thought she wouldn't make it.
[04:19:20.000 --> 04:19:20.581]  I'll admit it.
[04:19:20.641 --> 04:19:22.101]  Well, me too.
[04:19:22.541 --> 04:19:23.642]  I'm proven wrong, too.
[04:19:24.042 --> 04:19:27.563]  I'm proven wrong, too, because I would have bet my life that... Maybe Larry Dills is right.
[04:19:27.583 --> 04:19:29.964]  It's all fake, but, I mean, it's like Secret Service elders.
[04:19:30.004 --> 04:19:31.625]  She falls down, she falls down.
[04:19:31.645 --> 04:19:33.866]  I mean, maybe, I mean, I don't know.
[04:19:34.713 --> 04:19:35.733]  We saw the evidence.
[04:19:36.134 --> 04:19:38.275]  We saw the evidence.
[04:19:38.875 --> 04:19:45.778]  And it is my strong opinion that she knew every single question that was coming out.
[04:19:46.038 --> 04:19:47.519]  That she knew every question.
[04:19:47.539 --> 04:19:48.839]  That she was prepared.
[04:19:48.939 --> 04:19:50.100]  It did seem scripted.
[04:19:50.340 --> 04:19:54.382]  Yeah, I noticed she only stuck with policy talking points.
[04:19:54.442 --> 04:19:55.502]  She didn't really debate.
[04:19:55.582 --> 04:19:57.463]  She just kind of stuck with the narrative.
[04:19:57.483 --> 04:19:58.944]  And Bill Clinton was patting her like a dog.
[04:19:59.824 --> 04:20:02.826]  Yeah, I mean, she's done this, you know, what, 40 times?
[04:20:02.926 --> 04:20:15.153]  She's got her whole team, she's been, took the whole week off to recuperate from her pneumonia, and that's all she did was run through some mock debates, mock scenarios, so... None of which Trump had to do.
[04:20:15.233 --> 04:20:16.174]  He didn't have to do Trump.
[04:20:16.274 --> 04:20:18.235]  He went completely unconventional.
[04:20:18.275 --> 04:20:19.396]  He didn't have to practice at all.
[04:20:19.656 --> 04:20:24.178]  She had mock debates actually as early as today, you know, as soon as today.
[04:20:24.598 --> 04:20:26.538]  And she was actually reading off of notes.
[04:20:26.558 --> 04:20:30.039]  She was looking down so much to get her talking points.
[04:20:30.080 --> 04:20:35.881]  Whenever she attacked Trump, she had to look down first to see what her aides and, you know, her Democratic Party told her.
[04:20:35.901 --> 04:20:36.602]  I agree, Joanne.
[04:20:36.642 --> 04:20:37.282]  That's a great point.
[04:20:37.302 --> 04:20:38.302]  Let's bring in Margaret Howell.
[04:20:38.862 --> 04:20:40.123]  Margaret, what's your view on this?
[04:20:42.423 --> 04:20:43.344]  Oh, she's filing a report.
[04:20:43.384 --> 04:20:46.065]  I just saw her on the big TV over there talking something.
[04:20:46.085 --> 04:20:46.366]  Wow.
[04:20:46.766 --> 04:20:47.526]  She's got something to add.
[04:20:47.846 --> 04:20:49.407]  Anytime she wants to come in, she's welcome to.
[04:20:50.348 --> 04:20:52.089]  Thank you, Joanne.
[04:20:52.169 --> 04:20:54.151]  Jonathan, another J in Louisiana.
[04:20:54.511 --> 04:20:55.491]  You're on the air worldwide.
[04:20:55.511 --> 04:20:55.852]  Go ahead.
[04:20:57.092 --> 04:20:57.713]  How y'all doing?
[04:20:58.333 --> 04:20:59.514]  Doing all right.
[04:21:00.074 --> 04:21:01.615]  Man, we are living history, my friend.
[04:21:01.655 --> 04:21:02.336]  Go ahead.
[04:21:03.464 --> 04:21:05.125]  I know y'all are tired so I'm going to try to make it quick.
[04:21:05.305 --> 04:21:08.866]  We're not tired, where are you from?
[04:21:09.447 --> 04:21:13.008]  I agree with the last caller, she did have foreknowledge of the topics, I guarantee that.
[04:21:13.488 --> 04:21:15.929]  But a lot of things, everything was inverted.
[04:21:16.289 --> 04:21:23.572]  Like everything that she would try to throw at Trump, he could have thrown it right back in her face so much more hardcore than he did.
[04:21:23.712 --> 04:21:27.334]  But I don't think we have time to take it easy, you know?
[04:21:28.499 --> 04:21:30.401]  You don't know what the format of the next few debates are going to be?
[04:21:30.421 --> 04:21:32.322]  I've learned and I think I know everything, but I hear you.
[04:21:32.342 --> 04:21:33.543]  I would have been more hardcore.
[04:21:34.103 --> 04:21:42.410]  But the word is, just look presidential, look non-threatening, don't scare her idiot constituents, and just look like you can be president.
[04:21:42.850 --> 04:21:44.792]  I think maybe Trump's right.
[04:21:44.912 --> 04:21:45.572]  Time will tell.
[04:21:46.113 --> 04:21:49.595]  But I knew in the internal polls a month ago he was ahead 10 points.
[04:21:49.956 --> 04:21:51.297]  Well, they said he was behind 10 points.
[04:21:51.977 --> 04:21:53.998]  So I knew that was bull, people down in Seattle, it was the truth.
[04:21:54.838 --> 04:22:01.860]  I think you took the safe road, but in a crisis like this, is the safe road the safest road?
[04:22:02.140 --> 04:22:02.440]  Yeah.
[04:22:02.780 --> 04:22:05.021]  Also, here's the bottom line with the debate.
[04:22:06.302 --> 04:22:13.464]  Is Hillary, is she, is there anybody out there, any voters that were going to vote for Trump, but now are going to vote for Hillary based on this one debate?
[04:22:14.474 --> 04:22:15.155]  I don't think so.
[04:22:15.275 --> 04:22:15.475]  Yeah.
[04:22:15.995 --> 04:22:20.139]  No, I don't think Hillary supporters, the fact that he kissed her ass, are gonna support him now.
[04:22:20.299 --> 04:22:21.119]  I mean, he was strong.
[04:22:21.760 --> 04:22:22.320]  Let's be clear.
[04:22:23.802 --> 04:22:24.903]  I just... Yeah.
[04:22:26.064 --> 04:22:30.166]  They were really worried with the chivalry about a guy kicking a woman's ass.
[04:22:30.186 --> 04:22:33.488]  Well, this is a bloodthirsty person that's attacked a bunch of third world countries.
[04:22:33.508 --> 04:22:36.050]  I just say, look, you're not a woman in my view.
[04:22:36.310 --> 04:22:36.890]  She's a witch.
[04:22:37.291 --> 04:22:37.831]  She's a witch.
[04:22:37.911 --> 04:22:38.651]  I'm going after her.
[04:22:38.972 --> 04:22:41.053]  Alex, she's a sweet little grandma.
[04:22:41.153 --> 04:22:45.015]  She's a sweet grandma and she loves her daughter and she loves her family.
[04:22:45.035 --> 04:22:46.856]  That's why she always brings it up.
[04:22:46.896 --> 04:22:47.657]  My gut would be...
[04:22:48.858 --> 04:22:51.401]  I'm saying you're a witch, but maybe I'd be wrong.
[04:22:51.641 --> 04:22:53.603]  I mean, I'm not Donald Trump.
[04:22:53.863 --> 04:22:55.665]  Evil people don't get old, Alex.
[04:22:56.106 --> 04:22:57.267]  Evil people don't get old.
[04:22:57.548 --> 04:22:59.550]  She's just a sweet, sweet little grandma.
[04:22:59.850 --> 04:23:03.054]  People think all the evil grows out of you when you get old.
[04:23:03.074 --> 04:23:06.518]  So let me ask you, Leigh-Anne, should Trump have been more hardcore?
[04:23:06.558 --> 04:23:07.118]  He did the right thing.
[04:23:07.830 --> 04:23:11.252]  Well, I mean, I would have loved to see him really go after her.
[04:23:11.533 --> 04:23:17.697]  However, both of them needed to, both of them are allegedly disliked a lot in the polls.
[04:23:17.897 --> 04:23:22.680]  Trump needed to be able to, all the people who are Hillary supporters.
[04:23:22.720 --> 04:23:23.701]  They were feeling each other out.
[04:23:23.921 --> 04:23:32.547]  Well, he has to be able to look presidential to all of these people who think that he can't do any, he can't stick to policy and say how he's going to do something.
[04:23:32.567 --> 04:23:33.508]  No, I agree with that, but here's the deal.
[04:23:34.502 --> 04:23:36.423]  We all go along with the establishment.
[04:23:36.924 --> 04:23:38.044]  They said he couldn't win.
[04:23:38.505 --> 04:23:39.445]  So they're wrong.
[04:23:39.505 --> 04:23:40.766]  So why is he following their views?
[04:23:40.886 --> 04:23:42.827]  I get the fact he's big tit now.
[04:23:43.087 --> 04:23:44.168]  I'm not saying he's wrong.
[04:23:44.488 --> 04:23:45.829]  I'm trying to figure out, am I wrong?
[04:23:46.089 --> 04:23:46.710]  Or is he right?
[04:23:46.930 --> 04:23:48.431]  I'll play devil's advocate here.
[04:23:49.051 --> 04:23:52.173]  The establishment may have been expecting Trump to be a lot more hardcore.
[04:23:52.253 --> 04:23:53.734]  I would have liked him to be more hardcore.
[04:23:55.035 --> 04:23:59.437]  He just gave the establishment what they didn't want because they probably had all these headlines.
[04:23:59.537 --> 04:24:01.858]  I'm going to go with Trump.
[04:24:01.938 --> 04:24:05.660]  I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt because he's really showing me he's slick.
[04:24:05.680 --> 04:24:06.821]  I agree with you.
[04:24:07.001 --> 04:24:09.922]  I'm going to defer to Trump and I think we're going to watch and see.
[04:24:09.942 --> 04:24:10.162]  Go ahead.
[04:24:11.283 --> 04:24:13.665]  I was going to say they were going to go with the sexism angle.
[04:24:13.725 --> 04:24:17.369]  They were going to say, you know, Hillary was attacked by Trump.
[04:24:17.709 --> 04:24:19.191]  You know, it was completely unfair.
[04:24:19.211 --> 04:24:20.072]  It was sexist.
[04:24:20.092 --> 04:24:25.577]  I just think a lot of mainstream reporters are going to be riding the subway to New York tomorrow morning and be like, what are we doing?
[04:24:25.677 --> 04:24:27.279]  I've learned to like not know everything.
[04:24:27.379 --> 04:24:32.744]  Well, and that's why Hillary had to close the debate with saying that totally irrelevant sexist thing.
[04:24:33.004 --> 04:24:34.345]  She looked freaked out at the end, didn't she?
[04:24:34.365 --> 04:24:35.186]  Yeah, she definitely did.
[04:24:35.226 --> 04:24:40.170]  Yeah, I mean, she had prepared, prepared, prepared for him to say something off the cuff.
[04:24:40.730 --> 04:24:45.974]  And so, since he didn't, she had to close the debate with saying, well, this... I'm going to go to Jonathan in Louisiana, quick comments for everybody.
[04:24:46.014 --> 04:24:47.075]  All this Texas crap.
[04:24:47.135 --> 04:24:48.336]  Joe Biggs has a quick comment.
[04:24:48.816 --> 04:24:50.938]  Joe Biggs is running around out there about George Washington.
[04:24:50.958 --> 04:24:52.319]  We're going to go to him in a minute.
[04:24:52.699 --> 04:24:54.541]  Jonathan, go ahead, quick comment from Louisiana.
[04:24:55.800 --> 04:25:07.024]  Yes, uh, she uh, you're right, she was trying to bring up sexist point, uh, but he should have said something about silencing, uh, Bill's rape victims or the Saudi Arabia taking money from them.
[04:25:07.224 --> 04:25:09.105]  Or yeah, cutting women's genitals off, yeah.
[04:25:10.501 --> 04:25:16.564]  But also, whenever she said, she said it was because of Bush that we left Iraq that created the vacuum.
[04:25:16.984 --> 04:25:21.386]  Bush set the timeline to exit Iraq and we left because we didn't have permission?
[04:25:21.667 --> 04:25:23.567]  Well, what about illegally invading Syria?
[04:25:24.008 --> 04:25:27.429]  You didn't wait for permission right there and accidentally bombing them the other day?
[04:25:29.450 --> 04:25:31.351]  Um, I mean, and she said it was about his plans.
[04:25:31.371 --> 04:25:34.373]  Well, yeah, once you're in there, you can't exit until you've stabilized it.
[04:25:35.433 --> 04:25:38.355]  Right, and then she brought up about his plan to defeat ISIS.
[04:25:38.515 --> 04:25:39.415]  Oh, it's super secret.
[04:25:39.675 --> 04:25:40.916]  That's because he doesn't have one.
[04:25:41.236 --> 04:25:41.877]  Well, what's yours?
[04:25:41.997 --> 04:25:44.558]  Keep funding him, arming him, providing him air support?
[04:25:44.798 --> 04:25:45.619]  Is that going to defeat him?
[04:25:46.559 --> 04:25:49.741]  Well, the truth is Trump can't say this, but I've talked to the generals.
[04:25:50.421 --> 04:25:51.602]  It's we're going to cut off U.S.
[04:25:51.662 --> 04:25:53.163]  funding of a billion dollars a month.
[04:25:55.460 --> 04:26:00.162]  Trump, he can't say it because it's secret, because our government is funding it, admittedly.
[04:26:01.162 --> 04:26:03.003]  He doesn't want to hurt the country, admitting that.
[04:26:03.283 --> 04:26:08.165]  He could have, that's why, let me tell you, the word wasn't just he was going to tell Hillary, you're a piece of garbage.
[04:26:08.485 --> 04:26:10.426]  He was going to say, you're funding him, I'm going to destroy him.
[04:26:10.446 --> 04:26:11.746]  He sat back and did that.
[04:26:11.826 --> 04:26:14.227]  He had the weapon to destroy her tonight.
[04:26:14.807 --> 04:26:15.748]  He took the high road.
[04:26:16.568 --> 04:26:17.309]  I hope he was right.
[04:26:17.329 --> 04:26:18.169]  I don't know if he was right.
[04:26:18.690 --> 04:26:25.456]  You know, Roger Stone said the thing he was holding back was the fact that Trump was going to say that she's a liar, but he said that before.
[04:26:25.476 --> 04:26:28.058]  No, the word... Everyone knows.
[04:26:28.138 --> 04:26:31.361]  It's that she's funding ISIS and all kind of... He came close to saying that.
[04:26:31.401 --> 04:26:32.642]  You want me to stop saying it?
[04:26:32.942 --> 04:26:34.583]  The State Department's giving him a billion bucks a month.
[04:26:34.603 --> 04:26:39.888]  Remember that thing where he said one and he was like, you know... We had the whistleblowers from the CIA four years ago.
[04:26:40.208 --> 04:26:46.295]  Yeah, he said in the debate, he was like, you know, we wouldn't be having to fight ISIS right now, Hillary, if you didn't help create them.
[04:26:46.836 --> 04:26:52.342]  Exactly, so he has her funding him, and he's been advised, don't do that, it hurts America too bad.
[04:26:52.362 --> 04:26:54.925]  They had agreed before the debate not to do this.
[04:26:55.145 --> 04:27:02.394]  Hey, I just went through... He cheated and did that, so now the military's... I don't want to give out classified stuff here, but go ahead, Biggs.
[04:27:02.714 --> 04:27:07.960]  I just went through all the polls and Trump dominated in every poll.
[04:27:08.221 --> 04:27:08.501]  Good.
[04:27:08.741 --> 04:27:12.926]  I went through Fortune Magazine, Donald Trump beats Hillary Clinton.
[04:27:13.607 --> 04:27:14.767]  Right here, the right scoop.
[04:27:14.947 --> 04:27:18.529]  He's got 34,000 votes to Hillary Clinton's 12,000 votes.
[04:27:18.569 --> 04:27:18.889]  Wow.
[04:27:19.529 --> 04:27:22.990]  ABC News, Donald Trump, way over.
[04:27:23.050 --> 04:27:23.670]  Hillary Clinton.
[04:27:23.690 --> 04:27:24.591]  This is all mainstream too.
[04:27:24.871 --> 04:27:25.731]  Hardly anything.
[04:27:26.771 --> 04:27:27.872]  That's mainstream, that's good.
[04:27:27.912 --> 04:27:31.953]  Alex Jones, our own poll, 56% Trump wins.
[04:27:32.373 --> 04:27:38.895]  This one right here, PolitOpinion, Trump gets 78% of the votes for the winner.
[04:27:39.695 --> 04:27:40.736]  NBC right here,
[04:27:41.826 --> 04:27:42.546]  Donald Trump, 75%.
[04:27:42.626 --> 04:27:46.787]  So I think, when we're questioning him, I think he did the right thing.
[04:27:48.168 --> 04:27:49.488]  Donald Trump on Fox, 60%.
[04:27:50.288 --> 04:27:53.269]  Does everybody expect him to come in and dominate, or he didn't?
[04:27:54.490 --> 04:27:56.930]  Right, I mean, he obviously should have done it.
[04:27:58.271 --> 04:28:01.332]  Time Magazine, Donald Trump wins at 60%.
[04:28:01.832 --> 04:28:02.672]  Amazing, Joe.
[04:28:02.972 --> 04:28:03.892]  Let's race through calls.
[04:28:04.253 --> 04:28:07.734]  Sam, in the great state of Virginia, that's George Washington State.
[04:28:08.094 --> 04:28:09.014]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[04:28:10.285 --> 04:28:12.226]  Thank you for taking my call.
[04:28:12.566 --> 04:28:14.726]  I love your show and I love y'all.
[04:28:14.966 --> 04:28:16.227]  May God bless you.
[04:28:17.847 --> 04:28:23.188]  Basically, I was calling about what I think they might try to pull in the election.
[04:28:23.208 --> 04:28:36.752]  I think, you know, in the states they know Trump is going to win, they might try to, you know, fraudulently put in votes on behalf of Trump.
[04:28:37.441 --> 04:28:41.864]  So if he does win the election then, you know, they'll have the evidence.
[04:28:41.904 --> 04:28:45.586]  They'll say, look, you know, the election was rigged.
[04:28:45.706 --> 04:28:52.049]  Yeah, that way they can say, look, you know, the election was rigged.
[04:28:52.069 --> 04:29:01.415]  You know, Trump, Russia, whoever was involved, you know, they're going to try to spin it like that and try to steal the election that way.
[04:29:02.946 --> 04:29:05.148]  I gotta tell you, brother, I appreciate those points, Sam.
[04:29:05.168 --> 04:29:06.129]  That's Machiavellian.
[04:29:06.869 --> 04:29:07.830]  We'll talk about that.
[04:29:07.850 --> 04:29:09.531]  Aaron in Missouri.
[04:29:09.551 --> 04:29:10.532]  Aaron, you're on the air.
[04:29:10.572 --> 04:29:10.972]  Go ahead.
[04:29:12.893 --> 04:29:13.474]  Hey, Alex.
[04:29:13.614 --> 04:29:14.354]  Appreciate it.
[04:29:14.394 --> 04:29:14.875]  How are you?
[04:29:15.135 --> 04:29:15.635]  Good, brother.
[04:29:15.655 --> 04:29:15.955]  Go ahead.
[04:29:15.975 --> 04:29:17.777]  You're on the air with our full crew tonight.
[04:29:17.877 --> 04:29:30.546]  Well, I don't want to hurt your phone screeners' feelings, but you guys have already kind of touched on everything that I told them I wanted to talk about.
[04:29:32.804 --> 04:29:33.745]  This is interesting.
[04:29:34.526 --> 04:29:39.490]  My son was here with me, and he's going to be 13 soon.
[04:29:39.510 --> 04:29:41.211]  A couple days, actually.
[04:29:42.412 --> 04:29:43.913]  And he was watching the debate with me.
[04:29:45.454 --> 04:29:48.437]  And he said, Dad, who are you going to vote for?
[04:29:48.577 --> 04:29:50.298]  And what have you.
[04:29:51.599 --> 04:29:57.524]  I said, well, son, there's one guy who's speaking off the cuff, speaking from his heart.
[04:29:58.465 --> 04:30:00.426]  There's another person on the other side, just
[04:30:03.265 --> 04:30:05.107]  It looked like to be reading.
[04:30:06.327 --> 04:30:08.749]  You know, she was always looking down, reading.
[04:30:08.769 --> 04:30:11.271]  I don't know if she had an earpiece in.
[04:30:11.291 --> 04:30:11.991]  She may have.
[04:30:12.452 --> 04:30:14.433]  Do you know anything about that or no?
[04:30:14.453 --> 04:30:16.334]  Yeah, we covered the earpiece.
[04:30:16.354 --> 04:30:16.895]  We broke it.
[04:30:17.515 --> 04:30:17.975]  No, I hear you.
[04:30:18.035 --> 04:30:18.916]  I appreciate your call.
[04:30:19.736 --> 04:30:21.558]  What do you guys think?
[04:30:21.938 --> 04:30:30.524]  One thing you touched on, Aaron, that I tend to agree with is, remember on the Drudge Report, they talked about how Trump had this very unconventional debate prep.
[04:30:31.411 --> 04:30:32.572]  Yeah, hello Alex.
[04:30:32.592 --> 04:30:33.212]  Can you hear me?
[04:30:33.232 --> 04:30:33.513]  Yes, sir.
[04:30:33.593 --> 04:30:34.213]  Hey, I know that you said
[04:31:00.922 --> 04:31:03.964]  That you don't want us to thank you, but you woke me up.
[04:31:04.064 --> 04:31:04.664]  So thank you.
[04:31:04.704 --> 04:31:05.965]  Your entire crew woke me up.
[04:31:06.225 --> 04:31:06.966]  Thank you, brother.
[04:31:07.026 --> 04:31:07.826]  We're all together.
[04:31:08.006 --> 04:31:10.868]  Thank God I woke you up because that means we're on the same team.
[04:31:11.549 --> 04:31:12.249]  So don't thank me.
[04:31:12.329 --> 04:31:12.869]  I thank you.
[04:31:12.889 --> 04:31:14.711]  Our souls are together forever.
[04:31:16.111 --> 04:31:18.353]  So I served in the Marine Corps.
[04:31:18.613 --> 04:31:19.373]  I was a sergeant.
[04:31:21.235 --> 04:31:21.995]  What do you think?
[04:31:22.035 --> 04:31:27.739]  Because look, I've been in the trenches, maybe not like you guys are, but in my own way, I have been going to
[04:31:29.192 --> 04:31:31.294]  Some pretty scary places for a white person to be.
[04:31:32.134 --> 04:31:34.236]  In the houses of thugs.
[04:31:35.377 --> 04:31:39.940]  Because I wanted to try to figure out what was going on.
[04:31:41.221 --> 04:31:48.167]  Something that Trump is saying that is not reaching them is the whole stop and frisk.
[04:31:49.932 --> 04:31:51.493]  From their point of view, I can understand.
[04:31:51.513 --> 04:31:52.014]  It doesn't work?
[04:31:52.114 --> 04:31:52.734]  Absolutely.
[04:31:53.615 --> 04:31:57.418]  What do you guys think about having the police subject you?
[04:31:57.438 --> 04:31:58.359]  Let me be clear.
[04:31:58.379 --> 04:31:58.980]  Let me be clear.
[04:32:00.026 --> 04:32:04.327]  I support the Bill of Rights and Constitution because it is the renaissance, it is common sense.
[04:32:04.968 --> 04:32:16.291]  But when criminal elements of the government ship drugs in to then create a crisis, to then selectively put people in prison, I'm against that because you shouldn't put somebody in jail for drugs they're using.
[04:32:16.991 --> 04:32:26.574]  So I don't want to violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution, but I get you ship guns in, you create a crime scene, and then cops can't stop people they think are drug dealers and take their guns away.
[04:32:26.694 --> 04:32:28.835]  I get the position from the other side.
[04:32:29.972 --> 04:32:34.293]  But, if you stop the drugs being imported to begin with, it wouldn't cause a crisis.
[04:32:34.353 --> 04:32:47.538]  So, I say, when you catch somebody committing a crime, you throw the book at them, you don't get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution to fix a problem that was caused by the establishment to begin with.
[04:32:48.378 --> 04:32:51.599]  And I say, in the 1980s, in the 1990s, if the Clintons change a law,
[04:32:55.040 --> 04:33:08.386]  Where if crack cocaine's being used, which is mainly something that the inner city was using at the time and everybody uses it, you give them five times the drug sentence of some white lawyer who gets caught with a, you know, whatever it is of cocaine, that's bullshit.
[04:33:08.486 --> 04:33:09.326]  Now that's racist.
[04:33:09.526 --> 04:33:10.307]  Yeah, it's racist.
[04:33:10.347 --> 04:33:11.287]  That's pure racism.
[04:33:11.727 --> 04:33:15.569]  Cocaine cooked up this way, the same amount of coke, same sentence.
[04:33:16.875 --> 04:33:18.417]  One year, not 20 years.
[04:33:18.837 --> 04:33:20.259]  Unless you're Bill Clinton's brother.
[04:33:20.980 --> 04:33:23.082]  I mean, there is racism.
[04:33:24.304 --> 04:33:27.187]  I don't even think like that, because I think of myself as me.
[04:33:27.567 --> 04:33:28.428]  Like, what do I want?
[04:33:28.448 --> 04:33:29.209]  How do I want to be treated?
[04:33:29.229 --> 04:33:31.271]  I don't treat people like I want to be treated.
[04:33:31.952 --> 04:33:32.613]  I'm gonna die.
[04:33:32.753 --> 04:33:38.018]  I mean, I like everybody I'm connected to, but evil people, they look, oh, I screw this person over.
[04:33:38.038 --> 04:33:39.940]  Oh, look at these dumb black people.
[04:33:40.281 --> 04:33:49.330]  We'll have them use this crack cocaine we gave them the ingredients to, and then we'll write a law where they go to jail for crack when it's got the same amount of cocaine as something some white lawyer's using.
[04:33:50.271 --> 04:33:54.833]  I'd rather blow that white lawyer's brains out over the wall than put 20 little black kids in jail.
[04:33:55.153 --> 04:33:57.113]  They get out in 10 years as criminals.
[04:33:57.553 --> 04:33:58.714]  All they know is crime.
[04:33:58.994 --> 04:34:02.415]  Getting gang raped, getting pimped, getting controlled in those prisons.
[04:34:02.595 --> 04:34:04.936]  Because I'm no spring chicken, but I'm no criminal.
[04:34:04.956 --> 04:34:07.056]  I mean, I beat a few guys to death.
[04:34:07.417 --> 04:34:13.779]  I remember getting put in prison for months and people attacking me in those juvenile halls and all that stuff that went on.
[04:34:13.799 --> 04:34:15.679]  I can imagine years of that.
[04:34:16.379 --> 04:34:17.720]  Thank God I got out of all that.
[04:34:18.500 --> 04:34:26.166]  The most evil thing about this, Alex, is the fact that the establishment, they're turning African-American culture into this whole hip-hop crap.
[04:34:26.306 --> 04:34:26.766]  Exactly.
[04:34:27.307 --> 04:34:28.147]  They make it cool.
[04:34:28.508 --> 04:34:29.508]  Hollywood sells it.
[04:34:29.749 --> 04:34:35.373]  It ain't cool to use drugs, kids, but it doesn't mean that, oh, you're against the drug war, you're for drugs.
[04:34:35.473 --> 04:34:35.753]  No!
[04:34:36.153 --> 04:34:38.395]  I'm against drugs, and I'm against the drug war.
[04:34:38.675 --> 04:34:43.937]  And not only that, they put the people on the Ritalin, which is the same chemically as cocaine.
[04:34:43.957 --> 04:34:44.117]  Exactly.
[04:34:44.277 --> 04:34:46.938]  And they're getting you hooked on the crack before you even become an adult.
[04:34:46.958 --> 04:34:49.779]  20% of America's little kids are on cocaine.
[04:34:49.859 --> 04:34:50.399]  Exactly.
[04:34:50.519 --> 04:34:51.920]  Who pardoned drug dealers?
[04:34:52.320 --> 04:34:56.221]  Bill Clinton pardoned one of the biggest international drug dealers in the world.
[04:34:56.261 --> 04:35:01.583]  He also pardoned his brother, who got busted for cocaine.
[04:35:02.243 --> 04:35:03.484]  How many people know this, though?
[04:35:04.264 --> 04:35:10.569]  That gets caught with a tenth of an ounce of cocaine and then some white person gets caught with it and they don't get in trouble.
[04:35:11.089 --> 04:35:18.835]  And then Bill Clinton pardons one of the guys that was an international fugitive on the FBI's Top 10 Wanted list.
[04:35:18.935 --> 04:35:20.216]  Mark Rich, exactly.
[04:35:20.696 --> 04:35:25.980]  And he pardoned his own brother, you know, but I mean... My brother snorts more cocaine than a vacuum cleaner.
[04:35:26.060 --> 04:35:28.242]  That's right, he says, my brother's got a nose like a vacuum.
[04:35:28.262 --> 04:35:32.085]  You can't go out today snorting cocaine and then you pass a law
[04:35:32.885 --> 04:35:39.311]  Specifically on a drug made for black people, where you put them in prison, and then you claim you're the first black president.
[04:35:39.651 --> 04:35:41.753]  What the hell is that?
[04:35:42.153 --> 04:35:42.313]  Yep.
[04:35:42.914 --> 04:35:43.834]  What the hell?
[04:35:43.955 --> 04:35:46.537]  That makes me sick, because he plays the saxophone, he's black?
[04:35:46.697 --> 04:35:47.998]  This makes no sense!
[04:35:48.559 --> 04:35:50.981]  Like, what is making him black?
[04:35:51.001 --> 04:35:52.222]  Where's his black card?
[04:35:52.242 --> 04:35:53.903]  Because mine's apparently been revoked.
[04:35:54.003 --> 04:35:54.724]  Exactly.
[04:35:54.784 --> 04:35:56.145]  Mike in Florida, thanks for the call.
[04:35:56.225 --> 04:35:58.247]  Brad in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[04:35:59.753 --> 04:36:01.074]  Well, good evening, everybody.
[04:36:01.294 --> 04:36:02.535]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[04:36:02.555 --> 04:36:03.516]  You're the best.
[04:36:03.776 --> 04:36:04.997]  No, I'm not.
[04:36:05.097 --> 04:36:07.859]  I want to point out something, Alex, and I know this will hit home to you.
[04:36:08.819 --> 04:36:12.061]  I think Trump felt like you did on Piers Morgan that night you were on there.
[04:36:12.121 --> 04:36:13.762]  I think that's exactly how he felt.
[04:36:13.782 --> 04:36:15.744]  He was on the defensive from the get-go.
[04:36:15.784 --> 04:36:23.349]  She started talking about how her dad made curtains, and her granddaughter, and she just hit him below the belt, right and left.
[04:36:23.869 --> 04:36:26.231]  And then Lester Holt jumped in there.
[04:36:26.251 --> 04:36:27.752]  It was all scripted.
[04:36:28.567 --> 04:36:29.088]  Yeah.
[04:36:29.188 --> 04:36:29.809]  Yeah, Brad.
[04:36:29.849 --> 04:36:31.051]  So where does this go?
[04:36:36.576 --> 04:36:38.757]  Well, I think he's got to regroup after this.
[04:36:38.777 --> 04:36:41.418]  You guys all say he won, and I wish that was the case.
[04:36:41.558 --> 04:36:42.639]  I was watching it objectively.
[04:36:42.679 --> 04:36:43.319]  I love Trump.
[04:36:43.399 --> 04:36:45.580]  I hope he wins for the country's sake.
[04:36:46.080 --> 04:36:47.541]  But he took it on the chin tonight.
[04:36:47.581 --> 04:36:54.484]  He's got to get back in a ring, start swinging, get his guard up, and hopefully they'll play fair from now on.
[04:36:54.564 --> 04:36:56.905]  But he's got all the intelligence.
[04:36:56.945 --> 04:36:58.126]  They know what they're doing.
[04:36:58.226 --> 04:36:59.187]  It's all controlled.
[04:37:00.247 --> 04:37:00.867]  Yeah, I know this.
[04:37:00.887 --> 04:37:03.009]  If Hillary wins, it's the biggest mistake they ever made.
[04:37:13.069 --> 04:37:13.810]  You guys got a comment?
[04:37:13.930 --> 04:37:18.393]  Yeah, Brad, if I was to punch a steel beam, it would do nothing to the steel beam.
[04:37:18.413 --> 04:37:20.734]  That's what I kind of saw with Hillary punching Trump.
[04:37:21.155 --> 04:37:24.837]  Yeah, on the outside it looked bad, but it didn't do anything to Trump.
[04:37:24.897 --> 04:37:28.480]  I mean, Trump to me kind of showed how he's the ultimate alpha male.
[04:37:29.281 --> 04:37:33.604]  All the cards are stacked in Hillary's favor for this debate.
[04:37:34.471 --> 04:37:36.654]  Yet Trump still pulled out ahead in my view.
[04:37:37.356 --> 04:37:47.231]  So it's like, this whole debate, this whole election to me is about masculinity, American culture versus the social justice warriors and the snowflake mentality.
[04:37:47.692 --> 04:37:49.675]  That's basically Trump versus Hillary in a nutshell.
[04:37:49.995 --> 04:37:50.695]  Yeah, you're right.
[04:37:50.795 --> 04:37:55.218]  It's basically like they're trying to destroy that idea of masculinity.
[04:37:55.258 --> 04:37:56.779]  Like, masculinity is bad.
[04:37:57.119 --> 04:37:58.740]  That's why Trump's a sexist.
[04:37:58.780 --> 04:37:59.660]  He's a racist.
[04:37:59.680 --> 04:38:03.442]  He's everything possible, you know, that you can conceive that could be bad.
[04:38:03.482 --> 04:38:05.583]  You know, homophobic, Islamophobic.
[04:38:05.863 --> 04:38:07.304]  You know, Hillary just went into it.
[04:38:07.344 --> 04:38:09.025]  We're in the basket of deplorables right now.
[04:38:09.465 --> 04:38:12.147]  So she really tried to frame it as if
[04:38:12.947 --> 04:38:17.449]  Trump was just this monster, and I really don't think it worked for her tonight.
[04:38:17.489 --> 04:38:27.493]  I really think that even though Trump didn't attack her at the level that we would want, for the American people, I believe they saw through her lies.
[04:38:27.513 --> 04:38:33.835]  Tom will tell, but he may have engaged in some incredible, incredible, not even jujitsu,
[04:38:39.003 --> 04:38:45.575]  Like we talked about before, I don't think there's any voters that are going to flip their vote from Trump-Hillary just from this one debate.
[04:38:47.145 --> 04:38:49.808]  It's not that Republicans... I hate Republicans.
[04:38:50.348 --> 04:38:51.790]  It's that Trump took it over.
[04:38:51.850 --> 04:38:55.133]  He so clearly knows we're being screwed over.
[04:38:55.193 --> 04:38:56.454]  He just wants to have fair deals.
[04:38:57.135 --> 04:38:59.898]  He said with China, I'll just make you cut your tariff in half.
[04:38:59.918 --> 04:39:00.599]  He would have said that.
[04:39:00.759 --> 04:39:04.903]  If Trump was a real Republican, he would have been endorsed by the Bush family.
[04:39:05.123 --> 04:39:05.523]  Exactly.
[04:39:05.564 --> 04:39:07.666]  The Bushes attacking him is his greatest endorsement.
[04:39:07.686 --> 04:39:10.629]  And then the media tries to make it look like that's a bad thing.
[04:39:11.109 --> 04:39:11.469]  You know?
[04:39:11.669 --> 04:39:15.271]  Do we have any other comments before I take more calls from Leigh-Anne or from Dave or anybody else?
[04:39:15.291 --> 04:39:16.892]  I'll take a few more while we're on this transmission.
[04:39:23.655 --> 04:39:23.975]  Look at that.
[04:39:24.475 --> 04:39:25.255]  You hear that in the microphone?
[04:39:25.275 --> 04:39:25.655]  Uh-huh.
[04:39:25.675 --> 04:39:26.656]  It's fun.
[04:39:28.457 --> 04:39:29.597]  I will take a few more phone calls.
[04:39:29.977 --> 04:39:30.518]  Cowboy!
[04:39:30.578 --> 04:39:31.138]  Thank you, Brad.
[04:39:31.478 --> 04:39:32.598]  Cowboy in Missouri!
[04:39:33.059 --> 04:39:33.619]  You're on the air.
[04:39:35.109 --> 04:39:35.809]  How you doing?
[04:39:35.889 --> 04:39:37.070]  First time caller.
[04:39:37.770 --> 04:39:38.911]  Long time listener.
[04:39:38.931 --> 04:39:40.832]  18 years or better.
[04:39:40.912 --> 04:39:41.712]  Something like that.
[04:39:42.892 --> 04:39:44.033]  Thanks for putting up with me.
[04:39:44.073 --> 04:39:44.713]  My God.
[04:39:45.754 --> 04:39:47.214]  You are a soldier of abuse.
[04:39:48.015 --> 04:39:48.875]  You bet.
[04:39:49.195 --> 04:39:55.898]  You know, I think tonight we actually seen Trump kind of just hang in there.
[04:39:56.338 --> 04:39:59.900]  You know, but what I'm worried about, he didn't step up his game tonight.
[04:40:00.060 --> 04:40:01.981]  Maybe should have done a little bit more because if
[04:40:02.501 --> 04:40:03.662]  We have that U.N.
[04:40:03.702 --> 04:40:07.985]  deal October 1st and I'll give away our spot.
[04:40:08.005 --> 04:40:08.506]  That's a good point.
[04:40:09.505 --> 04:40:15.309]  You know, what if we can't hear what Trump really has to say on the next two debates?
[04:40:15.529 --> 04:40:16.750]  That's what I'm worried about.
[04:40:16.770 --> 04:40:19.872]  I want to be clear, the internet won't be taking over the first day.
[04:40:19.912 --> 04:40:22.754]  They'll think, Alex says they're taking over, I'll go first.
[04:40:23.075 --> 04:40:26.577]  See, it didn't happen, but they admit they're coming in the next six months to a year.
[04:40:27.138 --> 04:40:27.918]  So I agree with you.
[04:40:27.978 --> 04:40:30.280]  What happens when it's not able to hear this?
[04:40:30.300 --> 04:40:32.602]  I don't brag about it, but folks, don't.
[04:40:32.842 --> 04:40:33.542]  I got a ranch.
[04:40:34.143 --> 04:40:34.803]  I got a family.
[04:40:34.903 --> 04:40:35.504]  I'm going to be fine.
[04:40:36.464 --> 04:40:38.746]  And I want to be on air defending things.
[04:40:39.226 --> 04:40:40.267]  Don't take this for granted.
[04:40:40.287 --> 04:40:40.868]  It's all I'm saying.
[04:40:42.609 --> 04:40:50.115]  You know, it's funny, Alex, back in the 1920s when the technocrats really started to take over the Internet, well, not the Internet, but the media economy.
[04:40:50.295 --> 04:40:51.616]  Yeah, the media, actually the media.
[04:40:52.551 --> 04:40:56.232]  You know, they're like, oh yeah, we're going to take over the media, you know, so we're going to have control of information.
[04:40:56.512 --> 04:41:04.115]  But we saw decades later, they didn't take over the media because we have these parallel institutions like us, the alternative media that came in response.
[04:41:04.635 --> 04:41:10.337]  So that's why I see with the Internet, like, yeah, they're going to take over the Internet, but then we're going to have these hacker groups that are going to just start to darken it.
[04:41:10.357 --> 04:41:11.857]  They're all about decaying reality.
[04:41:11.877 --> 04:41:12.397]  They don't.
[04:41:12.457 --> 04:41:13.258]  It's a whack-a-mole.
[04:41:13.518 --> 04:41:13.738]  Yeah.
[04:41:14.238 --> 04:41:18.523]  I mean, the globalists can never have full control over humanity because they're just playing a whack-a-mole game.
[04:41:18.543 --> 04:41:19.544]  As long as we realize that.
[04:41:19.824 --> 04:41:20.145]  Right.
[04:41:20.505 --> 04:41:27.493]  And I actually got freaked out the last few days because I've been hearing how you guys have been saying they're going to take over the internet.
[04:41:27.874 --> 04:41:30.997]  We have ICANN being taken over by the UN.
[04:41:31.057 --> 04:41:32.399]  It's really, really disturbing.
[04:41:32.859 --> 04:41:47.504]  But I actually just got cable a few days ago, and I've just been like watching all these little shows, and it's literally every show is talking about how we need to control cyberbullying, and we need to take control of the internet.
[04:41:47.524 --> 04:41:48.545]  Which just means control.
[04:41:48.725 --> 04:41:52.766]  Yeah, to stop people from getting, you know, offended or triggered on the internet.
[04:41:52.786 --> 04:41:54.327]  Yeah, we gotta stop the Paul Justin Watsons of the world.
[04:41:54.347 --> 04:41:54.667]  It's crazy.
[04:41:54.687 --> 04:41:55.507]  No, that's it, exactly.
[04:41:55.787 --> 04:41:57.228]  You see the propaganda.
[04:41:57.248 --> 04:41:58.128]  Every show.
[04:41:58.488 --> 04:41:59.008]  Literally.
[04:41:59.028 --> 04:42:00.029]  It's crazy.
[04:42:00.589 --> 04:42:01.589]  Thank you, Cowboy.
[04:42:01.689 --> 04:42:03.390]  Jeff in California, you're on the air.
[04:42:03.430 --> 04:42:03.770]  Go ahead.
[04:42:05.531 --> 04:42:06.471]  Hey, good evening, sir.
[04:42:06.511 --> 04:42:07.471]  I know you're really tired.
[04:42:08.552 --> 04:42:13.613]  Like the guy said before, Trump could have done a lot better, but I think he kind of left his gloves on tonight.
[04:42:15.314 --> 04:42:20.135]  Hillary, not that long ago, about three months ago, I believe it was, I think he should have called her on that.
[04:42:20.155 --> 04:42:21.856]  She actually professed that the middle class
[04:42:22.654 --> 04:42:26.238]  Should pay their fair share, and then she gets up there tonight and she acts all holey as an Alex.
[04:42:26.258 --> 04:42:27.039]  She's on their side.
[04:42:27.059 --> 04:42:28.480]  I know, it was all contradictions.
[04:42:28.701 --> 04:42:30.002]  He didn't call her on that.
[04:42:30.042 --> 04:42:33.105]  He could have brought up the fact of the 28 pages that he brought to light.
[04:42:33.326 --> 04:42:43.116]  He didn't call her on the fact that, you know, she stands side by side with Obama regarding the issue to allow the Americans to sue the Saudis.
[04:42:43.136 --> 04:42:44.598]  That's a big one he didn't touch on.
[04:42:45.536 --> 04:42:52.738]  And, uh, why doesn't Trump just man up, get a clipping from one of those journals where Obama clearly states, hey, I was born in Kenya, because you want to know why?
[04:42:53.158 --> 04:43:00.099]  Because they don't want to admit that we were shammed, and that he's not a president, and nothing he said or did for the last eight years merits anything.
[04:43:01.339 --> 04:43:02.600]  He's not, he went over his head.
[04:43:02.640 --> 04:43:04.380]  I finally follow what you say, Jeff.
[04:43:04.860 --> 04:43:05.860]  Thank you, great points.
[04:43:06.400 --> 04:43:08.401]  Scott in Colorado, you're on the air, go ahead.
[04:43:08.421 --> 04:43:14.322]  Hey, Alex, calling from the purple state of Colorado for the first time.
[04:43:16.341 --> 04:43:19.783]  Hope the state's going to turn a different color this year.
[04:43:19.803 --> 04:43:22.945]  Hey, I had just a couple quick points.
[04:43:23.085 --> 04:43:31.932]  One was, I think somebody slipped Hillary a little bit of brain force because it seemed like she was mentally there, maybe not physically.
[04:43:32.232 --> 04:43:34.854]  Yeah, she looked like hell, but better than a week ago.
[04:43:35.835 --> 04:43:38.096]  No, I'm wrong, but I thought she'd have a coffin fit.
[04:43:38.116 --> 04:43:40.818]  I guess she was on brain force.
[04:43:41.579 --> 04:43:43.400]  Brain force does work, I'll tell you that.
[04:43:43.480 --> 04:43:44.441]  It has worked for my son.
[04:43:45.332 --> 04:43:49.694]  And, uh, another point was, uh, it seemed that, uh, you know,
[04:43:50.419 --> 04:43:59.501]  As I'm watching the debate, I'm seeing so many missed opportunities where Trump could have jumped in and... No, they told him, don't look like a bully.
[04:43:59.621 --> 04:44:00.301]  That's what happened.
[04:44:00.601 --> 04:44:00.861]  Right.
[04:44:01.241 --> 04:44:07.602]  Yeah, because I was wanting him so bad because watching the clip... He even told her, he said, I got stuff that will destroy you.
[04:44:07.622 --> 04:44:08.782]  I held back.
[04:44:09.282 --> 04:44:11.763]  But she's telling her, next debate, you're done.
[04:44:11.843 --> 04:44:13.803]  I think next debate, she is plowed.
[04:44:14.143 --> 04:44:14.983]  What is it, two weeks away?
[04:44:15.223 --> 04:44:15.483]  Yeah.
[04:44:19.406 --> 04:44:30.817]  Trump was down in Miami and there was a guy that stood up from Haiti and started telling Trump everything the Clintons were doing about the money in Haiti.
[04:44:30.857 --> 04:44:36.583]  I wanted him to bring that up so bad at one point I was about ready to jump into the television.
[04:44:37.443 --> 04:44:38.724]  But, uh, I just think you missed it.
[04:44:38.744 --> 04:44:39.405]  Well, I'll say this.
[04:44:39.445 --> 04:44:40.686]  I don't think Trump's a shell.
[04:44:40.746 --> 04:44:41.466]  I know he's for real.
[04:44:42.007 --> 04:44:45.129]  But if he doesn't deliver, he knows he's on the wrong side of history.
[04:44:45.169 --> 04:44:45.930]  He better do it.
[04:44:46.230 --> 04:44:46.890]  Thank you, Scott.
[04:44:47.471 --> 04:44:49.352]  Michael in Texas, and that's it for calls.
[04:44:49.973 --> 04:44:51.454]  I only got 100 more, but that's it.
[04:44:51.834 --> 04:44:52.615]  Michael, go ahead.
[04:44:52.635 --> 04:44:53.656]  You're on the air worldwide.
[04:44:54.516 --> 04:44:55.157]  Can you hear me now?
[04:44:55.357 --> 04:44:55.717]  Yes, sir.
[04:44:56.958 --> 04:44:58.539]  Uh, what an honor it is to talk to you.
[04:44:59.260 --> 04:45:04.384]  Um, uh, let me, let me read off what I wrote down here, because I was in a hurry.
[04:45:04.404 --> 04:45:06.766]  Can you hear me?
[04:45:07.363 --> 04:45:09.184]  Yes, sir.
[04:45:37.495 --> 04:45:43.137]  I did my book reports on Rush Limbaugh's books, and my history teacher hated that because she was a real liberal.
[04:45:43.877 --> 04:45:49.098]  But you've taken Rush's place in my life, and I'll follow every word that comes out of your mouth.
[04:45:49.998 --> 04:45:52.919]  And I love you so much Alex, and you mean so much to me in my life.
[04:45:53.259 --> 04:45:54.180]  You've changed me a lot.
[04:45:56.212 --> 04:45:58.074]  That's all I could think to write down.
[04:45:58.094 --> 04:45:58.815]  I was in a hurry.
[04:46:10.475 --> 04:46:11.596]  And they will be resisted.
[04:46:12.397 --> 04:46:14.639]  And there is a God in this universe.
[04:46:15.580 --> 04:46:19.023]  So you guys final comments on what Michael Lesko or not has to say?
[04:46:19.163 --> 04:46:22.667]  Michael, I talked to this Buddhist monk a couple years back in Austin.
[04:46:22.687 --> 04:46:26.130]  He told me that no one's more deserving of your love than yourself.
[04:46:26.471 --> 04:46:28.132]  So I see people think Alex.
[04:46:29.053 --> 04:46:32.856]  Yeah, I get it, but at the same time, it's like, you have that power too.
[04:46:33.076 --> 04:46:34.357]  Alex is flesh and blood.
[04:46:34.457 --> 04:46:35.258]  He's an individual.
[04:46:36.078 --> 04:46:46.746]  Alex to me is just, is the person that I feel that everybody would be if they were more conscious of what's going on in reality and kind of believed in themselves.
[04:46:47.527 --> 04:46:49.929]  I mean, Alex to me is what humanity would be like if
[04:46:50.689 --> 04:46:52.250]  It wasn't so enslaved by globalism.
[04:46:52.630 --> 04:46:57.692]  So yeah, I hear you, but at the same time, I think you can be just like Alex.
[04:46:57.913 --> 04:47:06.837]  If you really believe in yourself, and you just stay conscious, and you really start to talk to people about how you feel about what's going on.
[04:47:06.857 --> 04:47:08.738]  And no more fear.
[04:47:08.878 --> 04:47:09.138]  Yeah.
[04:47:09.598 --> 04:47:10.119]  Exactly.
[04:47:10.399 --> 04:47:11.039]  Just commit.
[04:47:12.340 --> 04:47:18.883]  Yeah, just go out there and start talking to people, and it'll be amazing to you how people will see you as a messiah.
[04:47:20.066 --> 04:47:21.847]  Yeah, I totally agree with that.
[04:47:21.887 --> 04:47:27.489]  Just be fearless and, you know, love yourself and just realize that the power is within you.
[04:47:27.989 --> 04:47:29.349]  You are the resistance.
[04:47:29.429 --> 04:47:30.670]  It really is true.
[04:47:30.790 --> 04:47:33.731]  When we have that promo, that's really the truth.
[04:47:33.851 --> 04:47:39.172]  You have to come within yourself and see, how can I actually contribute to this fight?
[04:47:39.212 --> 04:47:41.513]  How can I be a positive influence?
[04:47:41.613 --> 04:47:42.994]  I don't want to screw anybody over.
[04:47:43.014 --> 04:47:43.834]  I want to be good.
[04:47:43.854 --> 04:47:46.055]  And God will guide you to the next level.
[04:47:46.375 --> 04:47:48.856]  I want to just say the crew has done a great job tonight.
[04:47:49.716 --> 04:47:52.598]  And it's such a pleasure to know all of you in this great journaling.
[04:47:53.338 --> 04:47:55.619]  And we'll cover stuff tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[04:47:55.639 --> 04:48:00.822]  to 3 p.m., and then the Nightly News, 7 o'clock Central, and the weekday show and all the rest of it.
[04:48:00.843 --> 04:48:06.126]  But, you know, this is a great time to be alive, and it's all gonna work out.
[04:48:06.226 --> 04:48:07.546]  You know, Donald Trump's not perfect.
[04:48:07.566 --> 04:48:08.167]  You're not perfect.
[04:48:08.207 --> 04:48:08.727]  I'm not perfect.
[04:48:09.247 --> 04:48:18.333]  But it's a manifestation of saying no to this whole rigged economy and the renaissance that was America being hijacked to, like, fund this new
[04:48:19.761 --> 04:48:21.605]  Corrupt age of dominance.
[04:48:22.346 --> 04:48:23.168]  It's all coming down.
[04:48:23.328 --> 04:48:26.976]  And it's this, it's this oppression that animates us.
[04:48:26.996 --> 04:48:29.220]  David Knight, Leigh Ann, anybody else have comments?
[04:48:30.526 --> 04:48:32.488]  Well, I'd say it's just baby steps, Alex.
[04:48:32.508 --> 04:48:33.029]  John Bowne.
[04:48:33.369 --> 04:48:34.670]  John Bowne does these great reports.
[04:48:34.690 --> 04:48:37.353]  Nobody hates him.
[04:48:37.393 --> 04:48:39.936]  He would literally roll him out as he opened his mouth.
[04:48:40.016 --> 04:48:41.297]  How you doing?
[04:48:41.637 --> 04:48:41.978]  Good.
[04:48:41.998 --> 04:48:43.980]  I just showed up like a vampire.
[04:48:44.440 --> 04:48:46.562]  Well, it's just baby steps.
[04:48:46.622 --> 04:48:47.643]  Listen to everybody talk.
[04:48:47.663 --> 04:48:51.587]  I was just thinking, you know, when I first started here like five years ago,
[04:48:52.856 --> 04:48:56.418]  It's gradual information, and that's what Donald Trump did tonight.
[04:48:56.498 --> 04:49:04.041]  He didn't tell everything that needed to be told, you know, as far as, for instance, Hillary talking about the prison population.
[04:49:04.081 --> 04:49:04.661]  What a joke.
[04:49:05.061 --> 04:49:07.602]  This is the same woman that said, three strikes and you're out.
[04:49:07.662 --> 04:49:08.403]  She's behind it!
[04:49:11.784 --> 04:49:12.304]  Yeah.
[04:49:12.445 --> 04:49:13.525]  Of black America.
[04:49:13.545 --> 04:49:17.709]  277,000 prisoners in Bill Clinton's first year.
[04:49:18.209 --> 04:49:25.234]  That compares to 243,000 in all of Bush's term and 129,000 in all of Reagan's term.
[04:49:25.294 --> 04:49:27.456]  So, you know, three strikes you're out.
[04:49:27.556 --> 04:49:29.597]  Here she is professing to America
[04:49:30.598 --> 04:49:37.581]  After she's the one, her and her, what's going to be the first man of the country, which is strange enough to begin with.
[04:49:38.021 --> 04:49:41.142]  It's one thing to deal with a woman president.
[04:49:41.302 --> 04:49:42.342]  Okay, we can take that.
[04:49:42.443 --> 04:49:44.283]  Now if it was Ann Richards, right Alex?
[04:49:44.723 --> 04:49:45.884]  If it was Ann Richards.
[04:49:46.404 --> 04:49:50.185]  Sure, but we got a weirdo former president pervert as the first man.
[04:49:50.205 --> 04:49:51.246]  We've got freaks.
[04:49:51.906 --> 04:49:52.466]  A rapist.
[04:49:52.506 --> 04:49:54.067]  Yeah, and a rapist.
[04:49:54.608 --> 04:49:58.670]  And a first man who raped women in the White House.
[04:49:58.710 --> 04:50:00.131]  Just ask Kathleen Willey.
[04:50:00.191 --> 04:50:01.292]  This is the good news though.
[04:50:01.592 --> 04:50:03.313]  It's like Caligula marrying his horse.
[04:50:03.373 --> 04:50:04.233]  They've gone crazy.
[04:50:04.494 --> 04:50:04.734]  Right.
[04:50:04.954 --> 04:50:06.055]  This ain't going nowhere.
[04:50:06.255 --> 04:50:07.636]  Let Hillary cheat seal this.
[04:50:09.117 --> 04:50:10.058]  I mean, they're done.
[04:50:10.098 --> 04:50:12.500]  This ain't gonna work out.
[04:50:12.520 --> 04:50:13.221]  It's a circus.
[04:50:13.641 --> 04:50:14.882]  The whole thing is a circus.
[04:50:15.142 --> 04:50:16.904]  And that's the beauty of what Trump did.
[04:50:16.964 --> 04:50:21.048]  Trump went out there and he didn't say it, he didn't go after it for the throats.
[04:50:21.088 --> 04:50:23.110]  And as he said, no matter what happens, I win.
[04:50:23.150 --> 04:50:23.811]  I love that tonight.
[04:50:23.871 --> 04:50:24.651]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:50:25.012 --> 04:50:28.435]  Yeah, because America's, we're sick of the, I can cuss now, right?
[04:50:28.455 --> 04:50:29.136]  It's late enough.
[04:50:29.896 --> 04:50:31.218]  America's sick of the bullshit.
[04:50:32.133 --> 04:50:33.034]  Alright, we're sick of it.
[04:50:33.074 --> 04:50:33.614]  We've had it.
[04:50:33.674 --> 04:50:34.795]  We know what's going on.
[04:50:34.835 --> 04:50:35.956]  We see through your lies.
[04:50:35.996 --> 04:50:37.838]  We see through you.
[04:50:38.118 --> 04:50:42.841]  John Bowne, what is it like to, you know, tens of millions listen a day, your reports are every day, everybody loves you.
[04:50:42.861 --> 04:50:44.623]  You're doing a great job.
[04:50:44.723 --> 04:50:49.567]  Your dad's a Peabody award-winning journalist, but, you know, you've surpassed your father.
[04:50:50.007 --> 04:50:54.851]  My dad, actually, the reason he won the Peabody is because he's the guy that created the soundbite.
[04:50:56.933 --> 04:50:59.035]  He's the guy, that's the reason he got the Peabody.
[04:50:59.455 --> 04:51:14.168]  But it feels like loading the torpedo up in the sub, you know, when I'm finally sending that report out, I feel like it's just this torpedo of truth.
[04:51:14.688 --> 04:51:15.909]  Because that's what it is.
[04:51:15.989 --> 04:51:22.594]  I'm not trying, I may not get everything right every time, I may not have put everything into it that's breaking, but I'm gonna go past
[04:51:25.777 --> 04:51:31.423]  What people are scared to talk about, especially in the mainstream media, every damn time, man.
[04:51:31.843 --> 04:51:38.550]  I'm going to put something out there that's going to save my life, my child's life, my wife's life, your life, Alex, everybody's life in this country.
[04:51:38.570 --> 04:51:42.113]  And we're going to get past these bastards that have taken the building.
[04:51:42.133 --> 04:51:44.256]  What I have for words is our soul is in this.
[04:51:44.356 --> 04:51:44.496]  Exactly.
[04:51:45.397 --> 04:51:45.697]  It's real.
[04:51:45.877 --> 04:51:46.478]  Absolutely.
[04:51:47.038 --> 04:51:48.200]  It's completely real.
[04:51:48.783 --> 04:51:59.106]  You know, John, when I first started here, first couple weeks I was here, I was really kind of scared of going past that point that you were talking about, you know, that the mainstream media won't go.
[04:51:59.126 --> 04:52:03.568]  But once I finally kind of went through that, past that horizon, that event horizon,
[04:52:04.608 --> 04:52:06.508]  It's such a... There's no turning back.
[04:52:06.548 --> 04:52:08.329]  Well, it's such a wonderful... And it's empowering.
[04:52:08.549 --> 04:52:09.069]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:52:09.109 --> 04:52:10.249]  It's very empowering.
[04:52:10.329 --> 04:52:16.491]  And once you do it, we put a lot of hard work and effort into everything we do, but this is something we truly believe in.
[04:52:16.511 --> 04:52:21.312]  It's the ultimate form of freedom when you can think and say what you really believe.
[04:52:21.652 --> 04:52:22.272]  Absolutely.
[04:52:22.692 --> 04:52:24.032]  It's spiritual liberation.
[04:52:24.052 --> 04:52:26.433]  Yeah, spiritual liberation is exactly what I was looking for.
[04:52:26.533 --> 04:52:32.294]  And it ties us all to our ancestors, too, because you see all those quotes and you can feel every one of them.
[04:52:33.876 --> 04:52:40.564]  There's a human race consciousness towards being successful and not being bad and being good people.
[04:52:43.909 --> 04:52:45.210]  Our ancestors were good people.
[04:52:45.771 --> 04:52:46.552]  They believed in us.
[04:52:49.960 --> 04:53:07.750]  And the morality, the ethical nature of our ancestors, whether they were the supposed racist white men who owned slaves, or they were the people that were my ancestors who were helping out with the Underground Railroad.
[04:53:08.630 --> 04:53:20.415]  Or, you know, the millions of people that came to this country and did so many things that nobody even talks about in this completely stereotypical vision that the mainstream media puts.
[04:53:20.515 --> 04:53:24.957]  There are so many things going on in this country that aren't even talked about.
[04:53:24.997 --> 04:53:30.599]  How dare the media get between men and women and their love for each other and attack that sacred bonding.
[04:53:30.940 --> 04:53:31.880]  It's all satanic.
[04:53:31.940 --> 04:53:33.362]  We're going to break the enemy.
[04:53:33.723 --> 04:53:35.125]  We're going to smash the enemy.
[04:53:35.585 --> 04:53:36.427]  It's going to happen.
[04:53:36.447 --> 04:53:37.368]  We're going to the stars.
[04:53:37.448 --> 04:53:38.409]  It's all over, folks.
[04:53:38.890 --> 04:53:40.032]  And the enemy is scared.
[04:53:40.072 --> 04:53:42.515]  Hillary, I don't brag about this, Hillary Clinton is scared.
[04:53:42.776 --> 04:53:45.119]  She can feel our will leaning against her.
[04:53:45.500 --> 04:53:46.581]  She can feel everything.
[04:53:47.585 --> 04:53:48.646]  Don't worry about Donald Trump.
[04:53:48.686 --> 04:53:49.786]  He's going to follow our will.
[04:53:50.847 --> 04:53:51.607]  He's got a soul.
[04:53:52.128 --> 04:53:54.149]  The point is, the will is strong.
[04:53:54.229 --> 04:53:55.310]  It's leaning against them.
[04:53:55.330 --> 04:53:56.470]  They can feel that power.
[04:53:57.051 --> 04:53:58.171]  Just love God.
[04:53:58.271 --> 04:53:58.992]  Love everybody.
[04:53:59.392 --> 04:54:00.133]  Move forward.
[04:54:00.153 --> 04:54:00.933]  Have a good attitude.
[04:54:00.953 --> 04:54:02.334]  And evil will fall.
[04:54:03.074 --> 04:54:03.995]  We're out of time.
[04:54:04.015 --> 04:54:05.376]  It's been amazing.
[04:54:05.836 --> 04:54:08.838]  But like 7 o'clock till midnight.
[04:54:10.086 --> 04:54:10.727]  Yes, we are.
[04:54:33.567 --> 04:54:38.409]  Well I just want to say to everybody that this is, we are, the clock is ticking, we're getting close to midnight.
[04:54:39.009 --> 04:54:40.569]  So you gotta do what you can do.
[04:54:41.130 --> 04:54:47.492]  It's just because we're sitting in a studio right now on television fighting the good fight, we're just a few people.
[04:54:47.572 --> 04:54:52.653]  Just like the people in the beginning of this country who wrote the papers that got all the information out and they fought.
[04:54:52.693 --> 04:54:55.394]  It was just a small percentage that fought.
[04:54:56.215 --> 04:54:58.735]  You gotta get out there and do what you can do.
[04:54:58.856 --> 04:55:02.777]  You've gotta tell people you've gotta push InfoWars, you've gotta
[04:55:04.167 --> 04:55:10.809]  Get your own truth out there, whatever it may be, because there are thousands of... The enemy's never going to tell you you're winning, even when you're ripping their guts out.
[04:55:11.169 --> 04:55:11.730]  Exactly.
[04:55:12.070 --> 04:55:17.872]  Alex, you were saying earlier about you and me, we're not perfect, but humanity is not perfect, but we're still worthy of existence.
[04:55:18.703 --> 04:55:31.714]  I mean, you know what disgusts me about Hillary and statism in general is the fact that they think that controlling this lonely planet is everything, but there's way more to existence than just one planet.
[04:55:31.754 --> 04:55:33.135]  You've got the whole universe out there.
[04:55:33.895 --> 04:55:40.501]  I mean, you can really see God when you look up at the stars at night, because the stars are there to make you realize... How small you are.
[04:55:40.521 --> 04:55:43.283]  Yeah, not only how small we are, but what our potential is.
[04:55:43.483 --> 04:55:43.683]  Right.
[04:55:43.723 --> 04:55:45.325]  To see God's work of affirmative action.
[04:55:46.294 --> 04:55:51.018]  Yeah, and I totally agree with what Kit's saying, and that's how I feel as well.
[04:55:51.138 --> 04:55:58.764]  I just feel that we are human beings having a spiritual experience right now, and the bottom line is this.
[04:55:58.804 --> 04:56:00.185]  We're in a spiritual battle.
[04:56:00.245 --> 04:56:01.546]  These are Luciferians.
[04:56:01.626 --> 04:56:12.715]  These are very evil people who have a very evil specific purpose, and when we band together and we have positive thought and positive action combined, we can defeat them.
[04:56:12.795 --> 04:56:13.656]  So stay tuned.
[04:56:14.156 --> 04:56:15.100]  Their world falls.
[04:56:15.481 --> 04:56:17.850]  Anybody else in this live feed want to comment?
[04:56:19.500 --> 04:56:26.283]  Hillary Clinton said that Donald Trump is going through lots of efforts to plant doubts in people's minds about the election.
[04:56:26.383 --> 04:56:33.086]  So what she's referring to or alluding to is that he is going to spread a conspiracy theory about election fraud.
[04:56:33.567 --> 04:56:35.628]  I think this is a sign of things to come.
[04:56:36.188 --> 04:56:44.212]  And so, you know, if she does steal the election, she's going to say that we're conspiracy theorists for crying election fraud.
[04:56:44.332 --> 04:56:46.913]  Even though they now admit they're bringing in the UN to run the election.
[04:56:47.133 --> 04:56:50.236]  Yeah, it looks like the October surprise could be World War III.
[04:56:50.376 --> 04:56:53.858]  I'm sorry, but it's starting to look more and more out there.
[04:56:54.099 --> 04:56:56.220]  Man, they told the Joint Chiefs to attack Russia.
[04:56:56.961 --> 04:56:58.342]  Start shooting down Russian airplanes.
[04:56:58.402 --> 04:57:00.924]  I mean, like, who will stop these people?
[04:57:00.984 --> 04:57:03.206]  I mean, people are like, oh, you work for the Russians.
[04:57:03.246 --> 04:57:05.528]  No, I work for my kids not dying in a nuclear war.
[04:57:05.768 --> 04:57:06.348]  Exactly.
[04:57:06.849 --> 04:57:07.910]  We don't want that at all.
[04:57:08.170 --> 04:57:09.711]  I mean, it's like, can I just let them do this?
[04:57:09.791 --> 04:57:10.972]  I mean, I don't want to hurt anybody.
[04:57:11.012 --> 04:57:12.653]  Can I stop hearing how I'm this devil?
[04:57:13.114 --> 04:57:15.155]  Well, this has been an epic time-out on our broadcast.
[04:57:15.976 --> 04:57:17.037]  From 7 to midnight.
[04:57:18.118 --> 04:57:28.108]  I want to thank the crew, all of you, the listeners, the viewers, the sponsors, everyone, and just know that I barely even plugged stuff tonight, but just pray for us.
[04:57:28.549 --> 04:57:36.837]  That's what we need, and that is it for this transmission, so that Marcos Morales, the great guy running the whole switcher, can now go home and see his wife.
[04:57:37.458 --> 04:57:40.059]  He's been a nurse all night taking care of newborn babies.
[04:57:40.359 --> 04:57:40.619]  Yay!
[04:57:40.739 --> 04:57:42.200]  And that's it for this transmission.
[04:57:42.680 --> 04:57:43.640]  So we've got one minute.
[04:57:43.661 --> 04:57:44.041]  There they are.
[04:57:44.141 --> 04:57:44.841]  Put them on screen.
[04:57:44.921 --> 04:57:46.802]  There's Allie and Marcos in there.
[04:57:46.822 --> 04:57:47.882]  We love babies!
[04:57:48.142 --> 04:57:48.823]  Absolutely.
[04:57:48.903 --> 04:57:49.983]  And we're going to end this transmission.
[04:57:50.343 --> 04:57:50.843]  That's it.
[04:57:50.883 --> 04:57:54.685]  Tomorrow, 11am central, the Info War will continue.
[04:57:55.185 --> 04:57:57.726]  From this point on, Possum Belly is going to take a break.
[04:57:57.866 --> 04:57:59.467]  Sophia Condios.
[04:57:59.927 --> 04:58:00.647]  Great job, guys.
[04:58:01.107 --> 04:58:02.288]  Sorry I got chewed out by those people.
[04:58:02.308 --> 04:58:03.128]  They're just brain dead.
[04:58:03.248 --> 04:58:03.588]  I is.
[04:58:03.969 --> 04:58:04.369]  Yeah.
[04:58:05.089 --> 04:58:06.890]  All right, that's it for this edition.
[04:58:07.170 --> 04:58:09.951]  I think Trump won, but maybe he's right.
[04:58:09.971 --> 04:58:10.291]  I don't know.
[04:58:10.311 --> 04:58:10.911]  Maybe he was wrong.
[04:58:10.951 --> 04:58:11.992]  He should have been more hardcore.
[04:58:12.372 --> 04:58:20.115]  I just say justice be done by the heavens fall, but what do I know?
[04:58:20.435 --> 04:58:27.498]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and say, see, I told you so, that communist Chinese style net censorship was coming to the web because it's already here.
[04:58:27.878 --> 04:58:28.519]  It's being announced.
[04:58:28.879 --> 04:58:32.360]  The way you keep the Internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[04:58:32.840 --> 04:58:34.001]  You don't let them break your will.
[04:58:34.741 --> 04:58:48.998]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app and download an app that cost us over $200,000 and took us over a year to develop that we're going to be expanding on the next few months with free video and audio and podcast feeds and breaking news and alerts and so much more.
[04:58:49.278 --> 04:58:52.262]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[04:58:52.782 --> 04:58:53.383]  Take action!
[04:59:04.039 --> 04:59:05.760]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[04:59:06.340 --> 04:59:07.660]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[04:59:07.900 --> 04:59:11.421]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[04:59:11.801 --> 04:59:19.544]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[04:59:19.724 --> 04:59:24.545]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[04:59:24.705 --> 04:59:30.167]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[04:59:30.527 --> 04:59:38.050]  Secret 12 by InfoWarsLife is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[04:59:38.311 --> 04:59:42.733]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[04:59:43.013 --> 04:59:51.857]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[04:59:52.037 --> 04:59:55.338]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[04:59:55.598 --> 04:59:58.860]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[04:59:59.480 --> 05:00:00.821]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[05:00:16.164 --> 05:00:19.747]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[05:00:19.767 --> 05:00:22.109]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[05:00:22.469 --> 05:00:26.012]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[05:00:26.052 --> 05:00:29.214]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[05:00:29.714 --> 05:00:34.518]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[05:00:35.079 --> 05:00:36.900]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[05:00:37.260 --> 05:00:41.704]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[05:00:41.864 --> 05:00:43.885]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[05:00:44.506 --> 05:00:45.967]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[05:00:46.127 --> 05:00:46.367]  Exactly.
[05:00:46.387 --> 05:00:50.588]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junkie gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[05:00:50.688 --> 05:00:57.990]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
