[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.968]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:11.605 --> 00:00:14.926]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live on this Wednesday, the third day of February 2016.
[00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:28.670]  We're going to go ahead and fade down the intro because we've got a huge broadcast, big developments on the election front, huge developments on the Zika virus front being linked directly now by us today to the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.051]  Wait till this bombshell drops and a lot more.
[00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:33.992]  But first, this key report from John Bowne.
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.082]  Well, America, if you haven't noticed, Middle Eastern and African refugees are raping, looting, and killing all over Europe.
[00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:55.546]  And the European establishment is condemning the citizens on their behavior, rather than that of the invading hordes of fraudulent young male refugees who claim to be fleeing war-ravaged hellholes.
[00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:13.618]  For years now, those refugees have been coming to America.
[00:01:14.018 --> 00:01:17.100]  But it hasn't been large cities like Washington D.C.
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.161]  and San Francisco, due to their high cost of living.
[00:01:20.422 --> 00:01:29.066]  It's smaller American cities that are being targeted to become refugee sanctuary cities, exactly as tiny European towns had been targeted.
[00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:47.559]  Rather than integrate all of the refugees into large cities where aid facilities are better funded and menial jobs may be more plentiful, the Obama administration has been directing pockets of the refugees into smaller to medium-sized American cities that are already struggling to survive.
[00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:50.101]  Cities like Missoula, Montana.
[00:01:50.461 --> 00:02:07.170]  Twin Falls, Idaho, and Stone Mountain, Georgia, a population of 6,025, where a huge boon to the economy is the tourism generated by the Stone Mountain carving of Confederate generals, the very historical monument the liberals want destroyed.
[00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.873]  It was revealed around this time last year by political analyst Susan Payne,
[00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:18.395]  Who had inadvertently been allowed to attend an Obama White House conference call on the Syrian refugee strategy.
[00:02:18.595 --> 00:02:31.979]  Payne discovered that the intent of the Obama administration is to grow the Muslim seedling communities, in their words, into larger entities, eventually overtaking the smaller cities they had been given sanctuary in.
[00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:36.282]  As part of the greater plan to overtake the host nation.
[00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:44.970]  The Obama task force even discussed replacing the Thanksgiving holiday with Celebrate Immigrant Day by executive order.
[00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:56.680]  Their main directive being that these 15 million plus new Americans will replace the old Americans and grow as a separate nation within the United States.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:09.111]  Obama established the Task Force on New Americans in November of 2014 in the wake of a complete breakdown of our immigration system under Obama's unconstitutional executive orders.
[00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:21.882]  As of today, there are well over 180,000 criminal illegal immigrants freely wandering around the United States committing new crimes every day, according to ICE agents and members of Congress.
[00:03:22.222 --> 00:03:29.629]  Meanwhile, DHS Secretary Jay Johnson has issued an order to diminish aerial surveillance on the Texas border.
[00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.573]  This, after Governor Abbott requested more surveillance last September.
[00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:37.236]  A request that was obviously ignored.
[00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:45.524]  The Rio Grande Valley has seen an increase of 115% in unaccompanied minors, while the El Paso border has increased by 300%.
[00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:47.345]  Still about.
[00:04:06.374 --> 00:04:07.575]  What have I got to talk to you about?
[00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:09.896]  What have I got to talk to you about?
[00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.237]  So why don't you say it now?
[00:04:12.277 --> 00:04:13.858]  What do you want me to say?
[00:04:14.198 --> 00:04:15.519]  This f***ing ideology, it's got no place.
[00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.639]  Yeah?
[00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:16.920]  Yeah, it's got no place, bruv.
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.981]  I don't know what you like, bruv, you have about a hundred of you here in a minute.
[00:04:19.401 --> 00:04:20.362]  You f***ing little ching!
[00:04:37.782 --> 00:04:38.782]  And they are allowed to attack.
[00:04:58.149 --> 00:05:02.550]  ...are declaring their cities as sanctuaries at an alarming rate.
[00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:07.832]  Has the Paris Massacre or the San Bernardino Jihad been forgotten already?
[00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:08.392]  We'll be back!
[00:05:09.172 --> 00:05:13.674]  Sometimes when people are offended, they want someone to just come in and say, stop that!
[00:05:13.874 --> 00:05:15.975]  Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
[00:05:16.155 --> 00:05:20.696]  If you start saying, we mustn't criticize or offend them, then humor's gone.
[00:05:21.036 --> 00:05:23.037]  With humor goes a sense of proportion.
[00:05:23.317 --> 00:05:25.518]  And then as far as I'm concerned, you're living in 1984.
[00:05:26.738 --> 00:05:28.940]  That was John Cleese of Monty Python.
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.623]  Political correctness is not a case of people who are well-meaning but neurotic.
[00:05:32.843 --> 00:05:36.706]  Not even spoiled and tolerant brats screaming at you with their hands over their ears.
[00:05:36.986 --> 00:05:39.328]  It's a weaponized tool of social control.
[00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.550]  You are accused of heresy on three counts.
[00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.573]  Heresy by thought, heresy by word, heresy by deed, and heresy by action.
[00:05:44.613 --> 00:05:45.373]  Four counts.
[00:05:46.314 --> 00:05:50.396]  We should recognize the source where these weapons of social control are forged.
[00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:51.697]  The universities.
[00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:57.220]  Colleges are increasingly irrelevant to education, but essential to indoctrination.
[00:05:57.501 --> 00:06:05.565]  This is why Bernie and Hillary are so eager to extend kindergarten social control for free until people reach their mid-twenties or beyond.
[00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:08.147]  For Prison Planet TV, I'm David Knight.
[00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:09.499]  Hey, everyone!
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.725]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:06:15.985 --> 00:06:17.586]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:27.995]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:06:28.356 --> 00:06:34.321]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:06:34.801 --> 00:06:55.128]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out InfoWarsTeam.com.

[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:29.424]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:30.084 --> 00:08:39.670]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:47.615]  Thank you for joining us, my friends.
[00:08:49.913 --> 00:08:52.857]  It is Wednesday, the third day of February 2016.
[00:08:52.897 --> 00:09:02.331]  We're going to be live for the next four hours broadcasting across the planet and the world.
[00:09:04.329 --> 00:09:10.496]  Coming up, we have Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo in studio in the second hour.
[00:09:11.157 --> 00:09:17.985]  And then Dr. Edward Group has come in from Houston with some amazing analysis and information dealing with Zika virus.
[00:09:18.426 --> 00:09:21.830]  And then David Knight, world quarterback, the fourth hour today will break down
[00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:36.400]  What he's going to be doing right before he comes on, because they don't know till right when they come on what they're going to be covering, because while I'm busy on air tracking what's happening and covering the news, they're busy digging into the latest breaking information and analysis, as well as special reports.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:45.347]  Then, of course, we come back 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News, as well to cover whatever happens from 3 to 7 o'clock Central.
[00:09:46.226 --> 00:09:58.609]  Whatever's developed during that time period when big events happen, we just expand coverage with live coverage past 10 o'clock at night and we are able to hire more investigative journalists, more reporters, more researchers.
[00:09:58.649 --> 00:10:05.310]  We will continue to add more and more live, fully produced, fully researched transmissions for you and your family.
[00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.871]  We are building it and they are coming because the people are
[00:10:10.071 --> 00:10:10.851]  Hungry for the truth.
[00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:30.761]  Now, I've talked a lot about this, but we've gone back into the archives with the Jacari Jackson report from last year, actually a year and a half ago, and Bill and Melinda Gates' statements and their own patents and their own research, as well as the Rockefeller Foundation, and they're going to be putting together a very clear picture confirming what
[00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:45.908]  Dr. Francis Boyle said here last Friday, in fact we should probably just get the intro of his interview last Friday, where he talks about Zika for about five minutes, where he discusses top biological weapons experts that he's in consultation with, and of course he wrote the U.S.
[00:10:45.968 --> 00:10:46.388]  and U.N.
[00:10:46.408 --> 00:11:00.596]  Biological Weapons Treaty that was ratified back in the 90s, so that gives you an idea of the level of his gravitas, and he said unquestionably, it is a bio-weapon, and it's being race-specifically delivered.
[00:11:02.096 --> 00:11:11.182]  That means it's not race-specific, that it only attacks certain races of humans, certain variants of humans, certain, I think, breeds of humans is better.
[00:11:11.202 --> 00:11:12.062]  We're all one race.
[00:11:12.983 --> 00:11:16.225]  Different varieties of humans, as race-specific does.
[00:11:17.106 --> 00:11:29.434]  But what it does is, it basically is being deployed into areas in Latin America, but now spreading all the way into Texas, and is being sexually transmitted, and causes horrific birth defects.
[00:11:30.054 --> 00:11:39.238]  But there's a whole host of other pathogens in the vaccines and other areas that also cause the same birth defects, the same syndromes.
[00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:50.602]  I kept asking myself, until about six years ago, they always said in the news and in the medical inserts with vaccines and everywhere, if you're pregnant, do not take a vaccine.
[00:11:52.281 --> 00:12:03.987]  Because it was known to cause autoimmune disorders in children, it was known to cause miscarriages from three months to eight months, it was known to cause all sorts of serious rejection problems, you name it.
[00:12:05.388 --> 00:12:11.071]  And for the same type of disorders that Zika has been documented to cause.
[00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:18.175]  And so you look at the numbers that investigative journalist John Rapoport's gone over, we have a lot more of these
[00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:38.752]  Developments of deformities, the children's heads being much smaller here in the United States and Europe, the microencephaly, than you see actually in places like Brazil and other areas where Zika is spreading to hundreds of thousands.
[00:12:39.472 --> 00:12:43.955]  So is this a cover that they're saying the mosquito is causing it?
[00:12:44.516 --> 00:12:46.817]  But really it's what's being now introduced to the environment.
[00:12:46.857 --> 00:12:47.978]  It's like take Brazil again.
[00:12:47.998 --> 00:12:49.319]  You can look up these articles.
[00:12:50.598 --> 00:13:01.084]  Brazil had one of the lowest rates of breast cancer in the world until they adopted glyphosates, Roundup, and other weed killers in the same family in the last 20 years or so.
[00:13:01.464 --> 00:13:02.945]  And now their numbers are skyrocketing.
[00:13:03.465 --> 00:13:11.990]  Europe had low breast cancer levels until they brought in glyphosates, which we know grow the exact type of tumors that are most common in women's breasts.
[00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:13.351]  It grows them.
[00:13:14.099 --> 00:13:16.761]  In fact, it is hormone-dependent cancers.
[00:13:17.661 --> 00:13:19.182]  It is a whole family of them.
[00:13:19.723 --> 00:13:24.306]  So it's a weed killer, but it's a cancer grower in mammal tissue.
[00:13:25.146 --> 00:13:28.048]  That's why you see such an explosion in prostate cancer in men.
[00:13:28.068 --> 00:13:34.012]  I mean, this is well-established, well-known, well-developed research and facts.
[00:13:35.673 --> 00:13:36.894]  So we're dealing with all of this.
[00:13:36.914 --> 00:13:39.136]  We're trying to suss out exactly what's going on.
[00:13:39.156 --> 00:13:42.478]  Because a lot of times, like with HIV, it'll be the cover.
[00:13:43.868 --> 00:13:47.731]  For what's really killing people, a whole other different group of viruses.
[00:13:48.231 --> 00:13:56.017]  And I was told that back in the 1980s by my father, who pulled out medical literature and showed it to me.
[00:13:56.057 --> 00:14:00.060]  And then I asked him, I said, Dad, I thought I'd make him get in here and do an interview sometime.
[00:14:01.662 --> 00:14:02.923]  I asked him, how do you know that?
[00:14:04.084 --> 00:14:07.846]  And he said, well, I've been told that by high level people in the Dallas medical community.
[00:14:10.388 --> 00:14:13.411]  And then I could extrapolate many years later when my dad told me,
[00:14:14.862 --> 00:14:18.012]  Oh, well, yeah, you know, at Baylor where he was a professor of...
[00:14:21.673 --> 00:14:32.118]  Dental sciences, that he would be one of the guys that treated the high-level CIA people and folks, because they would come in with guys in the room when they would sedate them to, you know, do root canals and the rest of it.
[00:14:32.618 --> 00:14:34.579]  That's how paranoid the government was back at that time.
[00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:44.683]  And my dad still won't tell me about a lot of it because, you know, he wasn't really involved in a bunch of classified stuff, but he was involved and around those whole groups of people.
[00:14:45.103 --> 00:14:49.085]  And he's told me so much of the stuff he warned me about came directly from those type of folks, like
[00:14:49.705 --> 00:14:52.429]  Son, you're going, you're 15 to get your hardship license.
[00:14:53.049 --> 00:14:57.875]  Do not fill out the organ donor card when they ask you if you want to give your organs.
[00:14:57.895 --> 00:14:58.776]  And I said, why dad?
[00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:15.496]  And he said, I've been told by hospital heads that there are certain doctors in certain groups within the hospitals, in certain hospitals that lean towards this, where they don't give you the same treatment if you're in a car wreck or whatever, even though you're viable, because they can get hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:15:15.516 --> 00:15:19.618]  And that was back then, you know, 27 years ago when I was getting my hardship license.
[00:15:22.539 --> 00:15:24.439]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars for your organs.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.701]  And I actually thought he was full of it, but I still
[00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:31.019]  I didn't completely think that, but I was somewhat naive.
[00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:31.940]  I didn't completely believe it.
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:40.707]  And so, years later, I'm watching 60 Minutes in college with my grandfather and grandmother, because they like to watch that every Sunday.
[00:15:41.127 --> 00:15:51.075]  And sure enough, they admitted the hospitals in Dallas, the hospitals in Chicago, and places like that, exactly what my father had told me, point blank.
[00:15:51.856 --> 00:15:52.797]  But I'm digressing.
[00:15:54.195 --> 00:15:59.213]  Because we don't need to go back to anecdotal stories from 27 years ago.
[00:16:01.653 --> 00:16:03.694]  Dr. Group's coming in to break this down today.
[00:16:03.834 --> 00:16:13.737]  I knew the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation bought out the Rockefeller Foundation for all their weaponized cancer and weaponized sterilant research that's been declassified.
[00:16:14.477 --> 00:16:25.381]  I knew that they were heavily involved in developing these genetically engineered mosquitoes to quote deliver vaccines and quote other forced treatments on the public.
[00:16:26.534 --> 00:16:27.635]  Because they love us so much.
[00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:33.941]  I knew that going back to the 20s, the Rockefeller Foundation had already patented weaponized cancer that could be injected.
[00:16:34.241 --> 00:16:35.523]  That's mainline history, folks.
[00:16:35.543 --> 00:16:40.327]  Just search engine Rockefeller Foundation, cancer viruses, weaponized cancer.
[00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.053]  But then, when you actually read deeper,
[00:16:47.318 --> 00:16:55.261]  This is what Groot brought in this morning and pointed out, and sure enough, I've even noticed an article on CNN that we just showed saying, look where Zika came from.
[00:16:55.321 --> 00:16:59.623]  First they were claiming that it came from somewhere in South America.
[00:16:59.683 --> 00:17:12.288]  Now they go, oh, Zika's birthplace is Uganda, just like Ebola and everything else, where they have these big globalist and UN research labs where they've been caught testing on people forever.
[00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:22.130]  And of course, you've got Bill Gates releasing mosquitoes inside crowds of people and making jokes and saying, we've got to save the earth and bring one of these numbers down to zero.
[00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.053]  And the one number, of course, that he brings to zero is humanity.
[00:17:25.093 --> 00:17:27.096]  And the TED TV crowd laughs.
[00:17:27.516 --> 00:17:30.900]  We're going to bring all those clips back up today and play them in the third hour.
[00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:31.922]  It's going to be very, very important.
[00:17:33.186 --> 00:17:54.013]  But guess what Dr. Group found from ATC.org, and this is a database of the federal government and private organizations as well, Zikovirus, ATCC, VR84, the depositor and patenter and owner of it is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:17:55.253 --> 00:17:55.894]  1947, yeah.
[00:17:56.494 --> 00:18:00.055]  How do you think this virus gets over from Africa
[00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:02.282]  Magically.
[00:18:02.902 --> 00:18:14.153]  And then it gets souped up like Dr. Boyle, the biologist, the political scientist, the Harvard lawyer.
[00:18:14.173 --> 00:18:16.896]  It's quite a pedigree.
[00:18:18.544 --> 00:18:26.446]  The author of the Biological Weapons Treaty, that was ratified, saying everything points towards it being weaponized, Zika.
[00:18:27.046 --> 00:18:27.587]  Absolutely.
[00:18:27.627 --> 00:18:35.069]  Because Zika wasn't wreaking havoc in Africa, now Zika just magically is showing up and causing all these massive birth defects.
[00:18:35.089 --> 00:18:37.169]  So they tell you, you better not have kids until 2018.
[00:18:37.229 --> 00:18:41.991]  Now we're going to spray billions of dollars of chemicals all over your jungles and forests.
[00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:45.832]  Now we're going to have all these testing labs and, you know,
[00:18:46.252 --> 00:18:48.695]  Screening processes to make sure you don't have Zika.
[00:18:49.396 --> 00:18:53.821]  If you get bitten by Zika, and you're a woman, and you're pregnant, you have a chance of having a problem.
[00:18:54.101 --> 00:18:55.543]  If you're a man, you just get a light fever.
[00:18:55.943 --> 00:19:03.292]  But the point is, you know it's coming, and sure enough, I searched engines last night, they're rushed developing a Zika vaccine.
[00:19:05.095 --> 00:19:07.097]  Oh, I'm sure there'll be some side effects.
[00:19:07.138 --> 00:19:11.803]  Let me just guess, they're going to affect fertility like they always do, but that's okay.
[00:19:12.423 --> 00:19:19.531]  We get scared of Zika, we better go out and do that and we already have our new Texas cases of Zika popping up.
[00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:24.537]  But here it is, Zika virus ATCC registered VR-84 trademark.
[00:19:27.677 --> 00:19:33.780]  And the trademark, of course, is held in the patent, is by Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:41.923]  Source, blood from experimental forest sentinel rhesus monkeys, Uganda, 1947.
[00:19:43.864 --> 00:19:48.786]  References, Dick G.W., Trans R, sock, trop, med, hygiene, 46-509, 1952.
[00:19:54.736 --> 00:20:06.940]  And now, right on time, Bill Gates has got his mosquitoes, he starts turning them loose, and he, of course, is heavily tied into the Rockefeller Foundation, and all the fun starts.

[00:22:08.672 --> 00:22:12.177]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[00:22:12.918 --> 00:22:13.418]  It's true.
[00:22:13.538 --> 00:22:17.484]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:22:17.704 --> 00:22:19.566]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:22:20.087 --> 00:22:24.573]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.170]  Make the call.
[00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.531]  866-987-THIN.
[00:24:33.246 --> 00:24:58.809]  Alright, we're going to get into Zika and other clear biological weapons programs with Dr. Groot in the third hour and go over all the clips Bill Gates
[00:25:00.535 --> 00:25:04.497]  Admitting he's developing mosquitoes to forcibly inoculate you and so much more.
[00:25:05.477 --> 00:25:27.908]  Sarah Palin, you can come out to DrugsReport.com and click on the big link there, has now come out blasting what she calls Senator Ted Cruz's campaign dirty tricks and drugs links to her Facebook, where she says, thank heavens Donald Trump opened so many eyes to the lies, corruption, and total lack of accountability that comes so naturally to the
[00:25:29.738 --> 00:25:31.799]  Preeminent political class.
[00:25:31.959 --> 00:25:46.409]  And Senator Ted Cruz was spot on when he once noted that millions of Americans are asking for accountability and truth, which is why it's so curious and so saddened us, the lack of accountability with the lies of Cruz's own campaign.
[00:25:46.749 --> 00:25:53.254]  Yeah, we should take her Facebook and actually format it nicely and post it.
[00:25:54.335 --> 00:26:12.760]  To Infowars.com and then actually link some of the Ted Cruz campaign tweets in the hours before the caucuses even closed announcing that Carson had left and then it quote appears he's quit you see him covering their butts so be sure and vote for Ted Cruz.
[00:26:14.986 --> 00:26:19.053]  And undoubtedly, that scam did cheat Trump out of the big win.
[00:26:19.333 --> 00:26:21.898]  Look, I don't want to sit here and bash Ted Cruz.
[00:26:22.539 --> 00:26:24.602]  I don't want to bash Rand Paul, who's now dropped out.
[00:26:25.748 --> 00:26:28.088]  But Donald Trump is who the system's afraid of.
[00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:33.690]  Donald Trump is 15 to 20 points or more ahead in every other state right now.
[00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:50.213]  Watching Fox and CNN and MSNBC, all they do is say the luster is off, the aura of invincibility is gone, Trump is collapsing, Trump is discredited, Trump is over, Trump has lost his shine.
[00:26:51.133 --> 00:26:52.094]  Rubio is surging.
[00:26:52.134 --> 00:26:54.416]  Rubio, Rubio, Rubio, Rubio, Rubio, Rubio.
[00:26:54.696 --> 00:26:58.779]  And the establishment money from Bill Gates and everybody else is going to Rubio.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.102]  I don't think Ted Cruz is an establishment guy.
[00:27:02.482 --> 00:27:03.723]  He's much better than Rubio.
[00:27:04.084 --> 00:27:06.045]  I would take a Cruz presidency big time.
[00:27:06.726 --> 00:27:18.836]  But I do not like the nasty behavior, which we noted that night and yesterday, that he clearly had his people manipulating, claiming that Carson had dropped out.
[00:27:20.905 --> 00:27:24.127]  And Carson was a close fourth, one of the key people to shoot down.
[00:27:24.468 --> 00:27:27.430]  That is a very deceptive, dirty trick.
[00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:31.993]  And if I would have seen that out of Trump, I would say, hmm, that's pretty gangsterish, Trump.
[00:27:32.594 --> 00:27:33.835]  That's one big strike against you.
[00:27:33.855 --> 00:27:35.756]  If I see much more of that, I'm going to have a big problem.
[00:27:36.136 --> 00:27:37.638]  And I'm saying the same thing to Ted Cruz.
[00:27:38.258 --> 00:27:40.860]  Your wife being Goldman Sachs and CFR is a strike.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.781]  But that's OK.
[00:27:43.442 --> 00:27:47.405]  She's done a lot of good stuff in the Senate, for the Second Amendment, against Obamacare, and much more.
[00:27:48.632 --> 00:27:49.552]  And you've got a good history.
[00:27:50.052 --> 00:27:53.333]  But now you just did this situation with a dirty trick.
[00:27:53.693 --> 00:27:56.913]  If we see a lot more of this, I don't know if it counts as a full strike, but it's bad.
[00:27:57.454 --> 00:28:00.554]  And this is what Donald Trump had to say about it.
[00:28:01.294 --> 00:28:04.435]  Trump came out and said they'll sue his bleeping you-know-what off.
[00:28:04.855 --> 00:28:07.475]  Donald Trump blasts Ted Cruz over eligibility.
[00:28:07.955 --> 00:28:08.676]  Dirty tricks.
[00:28:08.836 --> 00:28:10.816]  And undoubtedly it was a dirty trick.
[00:28:11.296 --> 00:28:12.296]  And we've seen a lot of that.
[00:28:12.336 --> 00:28:15.977]  And now we see the whole media against Donald Trump that tells you what you need to know.
[00:28:17.543 --> 00:28:21.927]  I have been opposed to Obamacare from the day they conceived it.
[00:28:22.908 --> 00:28:26.991]  And Ted Cruz comes out with an ad that I'm in favor of Obamacare.
[00:28:27.011 --> 00:28:27.752]  Can you believe this?
[00:28:28.072 --> 00:28:33.597]  Just like he did with Carson, where Carson, he said, left Iowa.
[00:28:34.077 --> 00:28:35.238]  He's out of the race.
[00:28:36.159 --> 00:28:36.840]  Vote for him.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.041]  Did you hear about this one?
[00:28:39.722 --> 00:28:41.804]  He said he left Iowa.
[00:28:42.504 --> 00:28:43.465]  Carson's a nice guy.
[00:28:44.918 --> 00:28:48.960]  So Ben is all of a sudden getting calls that he quit the race.
[00:28:49.381 --> 00:28:50.802]  These guys said he quit the race.
[00:28:50.842 --> 00:28:51.322]  He's gone.
[00:28:51.362 --> 00:28:51.782]  He's out.
[00:28:52.843 --> 00:28:53.983]  Send your votes to him.
[00:28:54.924 --> 00:29:02.548]  What kind of people are we dealing with with these politicians and and made up liar, honestly, and made up stories, made up stories.
[00:29:03.209 --> 00:29:06.151]  Everybody in here, many of you know me from day one.
[00:29:06.711 --> 00:29:10.433]  I've been talking about we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare from day one.
[00:29:10.693 --> 00:29:12.194]  Now, we're going to do it.
[00:29:12.855 --> 00:29:13.355]  We're going to do it.
[00:29:15.825 --> 00:29:22.990]  If you remember, so important, from day one I've been saying, repeal and replace Obamacare.
[00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:28.294]  I've been talking about the five billion dollar website that never worked for years, right?
[00:29:28.894 --> 00:29:34.498]  All of a sudden I see an ad or something, Donald Trump is in favor of Obamacare.
[00:29:35.038 --> 00:29:38.401]  And people are calling, oh I thought you were against it, that's too bad.
[00:29:38.701 --> 00:29:40.422]  These are dishonest people, these politicians.
[00:29:40.442 --> 00:29:41.243]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:29:41.263 --> 00:29:42.904]  These are worse than real estate people in New York.
[00:29:43.857 --> 00:29:48.261]  We're going to come back and play the part where he says sue his butt off straight ahead and more.
[00:29:48.481 --> 00:29:51.824]  Huge economy developments, big military developments.
[00:29:52.705 --> 00:29:55.147]  Oh, huge brain chip developments for the troops.
[00:29:55.487 --> 00:29:58.169]  They're just announcing, oh we want to put brain chips in the troops.
[00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.210]  It's no big deal.
[00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:03.414]  You know, just a brain chip in all the troops.
[00:30:03.454 --> 00:30:04.075]  I mean, come on.
[00:30:04.095 --> 00:30:04.435]  Big deal.
[00:30:09.696 --> 00:30:17.103]  Chicago has recorded 51 homicides in January, the highest toll for the month since 2000, reports USA Today.
[00:30:17.343 --> 00:30:32.158]  Chicago routinely records more homicides annually than any other American city, but the grim January violence toll marks a shocking spike in violence in a city that has recorded 29 murders for the month of January last year and 20 murders for the month in 2014.
[00:30:33.579 --> 00:30:38.662]  The rise in violence comes after the Chicago Police Department reported 468 murders in 2015, a 12.5% increase from the year before.
[00:30:38.702 --> 00:30:41.904]  There were also 2,900 shootings, 13% more than the year prior, according to police department records.
[00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:55.733]  On another note, the quote, gun show loophole is often cited as a reason for the violence in Chicago.
[00:30:55.933 --> 00:31:03.078]  Investigative journalist Louder with Crowder did a report where he documented how FFL dealers religiously conduct background checks.
[00:31:03.338 --> 00:31:06.961]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:31:09.361 --> 00:31:13.562]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.

[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.441]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.881]  From day one I've been saying, repeal and replace Obamacare.
[00:33:33.121 --> 00:33:38.182]  I've been talking about the five billion dollar website that never worked for years, right?
[00:33:38.802 --> 00:33:44.404]  All of a sudden I see an ad or something, Donald Trump is in favor of Obamacare.
[00:33:44.924 --> 00:33:48.285]  And people are calling, oh I thought you were against it, that's too bad.
[00:33:48.585 --> 00:33:50.665]  These are dishonest people, these politicians.
[00:33:51.065 --> 00:33:53.646]  These are worse than real estate people in New York, I'm telling you.
[00:33:54.466 --> 00:33:56.907]  No, no, these are truly dishonest people.
[00:33:57.287 --> 00:34:00.269]  Then he said, Ben Carson has quit the race.
[00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:02.750]  The day of the election.
[00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:09.533]  Ben Carson, during a caucus, Ben Carson has quit the race.
[00:34:10.714 --> 00:34:12.294]  And Ben didn't quit the race.
[00:34:12.835 --> 00:34:16.116]  In other words, Ben Carson quit and let me have your votes.
[00:34:16.376 --> 00:34:17.337]  What kind of crap is this?
[00:34:17.617 --> 00:34:21.599]  And then he makes up a thing that says like it's on a government document.
[00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:27.531]  Voter violation, it says on top, just like it comes right out of government, municipal.
[00:34:28.132 --> 00:34:29.475]  Voter violation.
[00:34:30.393 --> 00:34:33.916]  And it talks about, it gives grades, F, F, F, F, you haven't voted.
[00:34:34.697 --> 00:34:36.798]  But it says you can go vote, but you gotta go vote for him.
[00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:40.642]  And people are afraid, they think, oh, I'm in violation, I have to go vote.
[00:34:41.362 --> 00:34:42.924]  What kind of people are these people?
[00:34:43.464 --> 00:34:49.830]  And then the Attorney General in Iowa is investigated, but by that time they're all gone, the election's over.
[00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:53.433]  What kind of people do we have running for office?
[00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:58.126]  No, it's honestly, really, really dishonest.
[00:34:58.347 --> 00:34:59.407]  And I think I know why.
[00:35:00.087 --> 00:35:00.667]  You know why?
[00:35:01.568 --> 00:35:03.569]  Because he was born in Canada!
[00:35:05.189 --> 00:35:05.509]  Was.
[00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:08.731]  Happens to be a problem, folks.
[00:35:08.771 --> 00:35:09.351]  That happens.
[00:35:09.651 --> 00:35:12.652]  You watch, the Democrats, they've already said they're gonna sue him.
[00:35:12.972 --> 00:35:15.273]  He gets the nomination, they're gonna sue his ass off.
[00:35:15.533 --> 00:35:17.554]  Actually, they're gonna sue the country, but they're gonna sue him.
[00:35:18.175 --> 00:35:19.015]  And that's a big problem.
[00:35:20.495 --> 00:35:21.536]  So, there you go.
[00:35:22.276 --> 00:35:24.097]  Ladies and gentlemen, bottom line.
[00:35:26.041 --> 00:35:31.685]  Donald Trump is telling the truth there when he says that he was not for Obamacare and said it was terrible.
[00:35:32.265 --> 00:35:39.910]  He said the Iraq war was a horrible idea back in 2003 when no one else but people like this show were saying that.
[00:35:41.581 --> 00:35:43.402]  And they try to come out and act like he was for the war.
[00:35:43.462 --> 00:35:45.364]  They are spinning everything that he stood for.
[00:35:45.904 --> 00:35:48.967]  He did make sickening comments like, I like Hillary Clinton.
[00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:54.931]  I just like her because that's because he was trying to work in New York state where she was a senator.
[00:35:55.252 --> 00:35:56.613]  So he admits he played politics.
[00:35:57.529 --> 00:35:59.710]  What matters here is what I've said hundreds of times.
[00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:15.700]  The entire power structure, Bilderberg, Davos, the elites, both political parties, every TV channel I tune to says, Marco Rubio, Marco Rubio, turbocharging, leading, surging, going to win, when he's like 5, 6, 7 points in New Hampshire.
[00:36:17.421 --> 00:36:18.202]  And Trump's almost 40.
[00:36:21.484 --> 00:36:24.586]  And he's 15 to 20 points ahead of Cruz.
[00:36:28.404 --> 00:36:29.025]  But they don't care.
[00:36:29.045 --> 00:36:30.526]  They're now saying, he's over.
[00:36:30.546 --> 00:36:32.788]  His shine is gone.
[00:36:32.808 --> 00:36:35.491]  His aura of invincibility is gone.
[00:36:37.473 --> 00:36:39.375]  Trying to create that perception.
[00:36:39.455 --> 00:36:41.337]  So you can say what you want about Donald Trump.
[00:36:41.357 --> 00:36:44.260]  I'm going to say this very slowly to folks out there that are confused by it.
[00:36:45.421 --> 00:36:48.765]  The power structure that we don't like that's been screwing us over.
[00:36:49.921 --> 00:37:04.875]  Special interests that are globalist, that want to make us poor to politically control us, that want crony, centralized capitalism on top and socialism and communism on bottom to domesticate us, to make us dependent.
[00:37:05.676 --> 00:37:08.218]  They don't like Donald Trump.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:13.443]  Now it's a no-brainer then that we should like Donald Trump.
[00:37:17.347 --> 00:37:20.269]  If he betrays us, he becomes our enemy, just like they are.
[00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:41.706]  But at this time, we know Hillary Clinton's bad, we know Bernie Sanders is bad, we know Jeb Bush is bad, and Ted Cruz, getting money from Goldman Sachs, the top of the pyramid, his wife being CFR, working for him high level, to me that's a black eye, but I can see people turn a corner and truly be anti-establishment.
[00:37:43.107 --> 00:37:44.708]  But the hanging out with Henry Kissinger,
[00:37:45.834 --> 00:37:47.395]  They're hanging out with George Bush, Jr.
[00:37:47.415 --> 00:37:48.616]  saying he's his mentor.
[00:37:49.337 --> 00:37:50.878]  It starts to stink to high heaven.
[00:37:51.938 --> 00:38:01.225]  And then they come in and have not one, not two, but three of the top surrogates, including the congressman from Iowa, tweet that, oh, Carson has left.
[00:38:01.665 --> 00:38:02.546]  Carson has given up.
[00:38:02.806 --> 00:38:06.409]  He better vote for us when nothing happened of the kind.
[00:38:06.429 --> 00:38:10.852]  He is a dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty trick.
[00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:16.032]  And it really makes me suspicious.
[00:38:16.733 --> 00:38:20.436]  You didn't see Trump's people coming out saying Carson had quit.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.541]  You didn't see other people doing that.
[00:38:31.345 --> 00:38:36.549]  And now Ben Carson is saying Cruz's apology needs accountability.
[00:38:37.486 --> 00:38:50.613]  During an appearance on Fox Business Networks after the Bell Republican presidential candidate, Ben Carson responded to an apology from Ted Cruz after his campaign allegedly, well no, they did it, spread false rumors that he had dropped out of the race.
[00:38:54.715 --> 00:38:57.737]  As Christians, of course, we accept people's apologies, Carson said.
[00:38:58.357 --> 00:39:04.541]  We also have to ask ourselves, is this acceptable to us, the American people, or should there be some accountability?
[00:39:05.677 --> 00:39:08.899]  Carson added, there should be some consequences for things.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.802]  You don't just say, oh, OK, sorry, let's move on.
[00:39:12.822 --> 00:39:14.144]  The damage was done to me.
[00:39:14.484 --> 00:39:15.384]  It wasn't done to them.
[00:39:15.444 --> 00:39:15.865]  That's right.
[00:39:17.646 --> 00:39:20.028]  Undoubtedly, this is hours before it closes.
[00:39:20.088 --> 00:39:20.829]  The word spreads.
[00:39:20.849 --> 00:39:21.749]  They put out all these tweets.
[00:39:21.789 --> 00:39:22.230]  He's quit.
[00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:22.670]  He's left.
[00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:23.090]  It's over.
[00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:23.991]  His people believe it.
[00:39:25.312 --> 00:39:26.753]  And who's reaching out to him to tell him?
[00:39:26.793 --> 00:39:27.634]  It's the Cruz people.
[00:39:27.834 --> 00:39:28.635]  Hey, vote for us!
[00:39:29.773 --> 00:39:30.834]  To push them above Trump.
[00:39:31.615 --> 00:39:36.759]  And the sad thing here for Cruz is he may not have even needed to do this to get above Trump.
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.002]  Because the establishment doesn't want Ted Cruz either.
[00:39:40.363 --> 00:39:42.244]  He may get some of his money from him.
[00:39:42.264 --> 00:39:43.225]  He may have worked with him.
[00:39:43.285 --> 00:39:44.106]  They don't trust him.
[00:39:44.907 --> 00:39:46.228]  His voting record's too good.
[00:39:47.269 --> 00:39:48.790]  His affiliations are too good.
[00:39:49.351 --> 00:39:50.952]  The direction he's been taken for 10 years.
[00:39:53.905 --> 00:40:01.073]  With what he stood for in Texas politics, and now in the Senate, is too good for them to ever truly trust him.
[00:40:01.334 --> 00:40:06.660]  But boy, they know they can deal with him before they can deal with Trump.
[00:40:07.861 --> 00:40:13.168]  That was a mistake Trump made two weeks ago, going, look, everybody hates Cruz, he's hard to deal with, I can deal with folks in Congress.
[00:40:13.208 --> 00:40:14.089]  That's not what people want to hear.
[00:40:19.807 --> 00:40:20.529]  Breaking news!
[00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:27.870]  The press is reporting that Ben Carson is taking time off from the campaign after a loss in Iowa and making a big announcement next week.
[00:40:29.343 --> 00:40:33.525]  Please inform any Carson caucus goers of this news and urge them to vote Ted Cruz.
[00:40:33.945 --> 00:40:35.926]  Yeah, that's just one of his people.
[00:40:36.686 --> 00:40:45.491]  It was much clearer in many of the tweets put out officially by the congressman who was running his campaign in Iowa and others that, well, he's left, he's quitting, word is he's quit, better vote for Ted Cruz.
[00:40:45.811 --> 00:40:47.271]  I'm not going to beat a dead horse anymore.
[00:40:47.592 --> 00:40:54.135]  Everybody knows about Hillary winning six coin tosses in a row to get the one up for grabs delegate in the six precincts that tied.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.721]  And so that's clearly a fraud.
[00:40:56.761 --> 00:40:59.422]  Everybody knows about the Microsoft computers going belly up.
[00:40:59.882 --> 00:41:02.084]  Right in the precincts where that happened, everybody knows about.
[00:41:02.884 --> 00:41:03.585]  He has crowds of 50,000.
[00:41:04.085 --> 00:41:05.626]  She has crowds of 500.
[00:41:06.386 --> 00:41:07.747]  But magically, he lost.
[00:41:09.668 --> 00:41:10.889]  I mean, does anyone buy that?
[00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:16.392]  When an election's being stolen, they will keep the two neck and neck.
[00:41:17.819 --> 00:41:27.663]  Until they decide exactly how to cheat, because they don't want to cheat too big, because then investigations get started, and there's too many areas where the cheating happened, so you're going to get caught here or there.
[00:41:27.923 --> 00:41:30.864]  A witness might go public, as they have before in many states.
[00:41:31.804 --> 00:41:35.146]  And so, when they cheat, they cheat to the bare minimum.
[00:41:36.306 --> 00:41:38.947]  The bare minimum, so that it looks plausible.
[00:41:40.128 --> 00:41:46.470]  You look at the modus operandi of stolen elections, and it's all over Iowa with Hillary Clinton.
[00:41:47.563 --> 00:41:50.524]  And it's all over Iowa with Ted Cruz.
[00:41:52.584 --> 00:42:08.027]  And we have Ted Cruz red-handed putting out not one, not two, not three, but four tweets from their official campaign and their surrogates saying, Carson, the word is, is out, better vote for Cruz.
[00:42:08.407 --> 00:42:09.587]  Unprecedented.
[00:42:11.728 --> 00:42:16.149]  Ted Cruz comes out and says, oh, I'm sorry, there was some confusion, wasn't meant, you know, sorry about that.
[00:42:16.549 --> 00:42:17.249]  Sorry about that?
[00:42:20.475 --> 00:42:28.961]  Look, his campaign managers and the head of his campaign in Iowa, they all knew exactly what they were doing, so don't talk to us like we're stupid, Cruz.
[00:42:31.583 --> 00:42:36.066]  All right, let's move on from there, because forget Ted Cruz, okay?
[00:42:36.106 --> 00:42:38.348]  He's not going to do as well in these other states.
[00:42:38.648 --> 00:42:39.469]  It's Rubio.
[00:42:41.977 --> 00:42:45.819]  Marco Rubio has the full backing of the system behind him now.
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.500]  And that's where you're going to see the fraud.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.162]  And that's where we saw it in Iowa when it came to the elections.
[00:42:50.462 --> 00:43:00.148]  The polls had him 10 to 15 points basically down, depending on which poll.
[00:43:00.168 --> 00:43:01.429]  Most of them about 6, 7, 8 points.
[00:43:01.729 --> 00:43:07.173]  And then he got double what he was showing in polls on average when it came time for election night.
[00:43:07.353 --> 00:43:09.274]  But all the other polls were pretty accurate.
[00:43:10.899 --> 00:43:26.164]  While the system keeps saying for two weeks before, the surge of Rubio, the surge of Rubio, the surge of Rubio, the surge of Rubio, on and on and on, until I almost caught myself saying the surge of Rubio like I was in an ashram or something, you know, doing Vedic chants.
[00:43:27.745 --> 00:43:29.485]  Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna.
[00:43:29.725 --> 00:43:31.246]  I mean, it was going on and on.
[00:43:31.266 --> 00:43:31.806]  It still is.
[00:43:32.046 --> 00:43:33.787]  Surge of Rubio, surge of Rubio, surge of Rubio.
[00:43:34.027 --> 00:43:34.907]  Rubio looking good.
[00:43:34.967 --> 00:43:35.787]  Rubio doing great.
[00:43:36.227 --> 00:43:37.568]  I mean, don't people see
[00:43:39.107 --> 00:43:40.528]  The system propping him up?
[00:43:40.548 --> 00:43:40.888]  You know what?
[00:43:40.948 --> 00:43:41.688]  I think they do.
[00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:49.772]  They just say that so you feel like you're alone when they steal the elections and give it to Marco Rubio, Bill Clinton 2.0.
[00:43:50.913 --> 00:44:05.980]  Because if we don't buy the gimmick of a woman in the White House, if folks reject that and she gets indicted, and we don't buy the gimmick of President Obama, his whole legacy, well how about the gimmick of the first Hispanic president?
[00:44:07.082 --> 00:44:13.544]  I would vote for a Latino or Cuban or Hispanic president in one second if they had a good record, if they were constitutionalists.
[00:44:13.924 --> 00:44:23.946]  I will vote for Ted Cruz, despite his clear dirty tricks over a Hillary Clinton or Bernie, because let me tell you, the dirty tricks of cheating somebody in an election is bad enough, but it's nothing compared.
[00:44:23.966 --> 00:44:27.147]  And there's some plausible deniability that just his surrogates did it.
[00:44:28.347 --> 00:44:34.649]  It's a lot better than Hillary with her long line of murders and corruption and Benghazi and everything else that makes your head spin.
[00:44:35.896 --> 00:44:45.163]  But I think if Ted Cruz really wants to get ahead of this, he needs to have the people that did it come out and apologize themselves and distance themselves from the campaign.
[00:44:46.444 --> 00:44:48.005]  But I wouldn't hold your breath for that.
[00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:56.192]  Because somebody like Ted Cruz, a little smart for his own riches.
[00:44:57.713 --> 00:45:00.115]  Smart enough to cheat, not smart enough not to cheat.
[00:45:01.496 --> 00:45:02.476]  It was a stupid move.
[00:45:03.797 --> 00:45:04.978]  It's very, very transparent.
[00:45:05.018 --> 00:45:05.659]  It's disgusting.
[00:45:07.813 --> 00:45:09.534]  Now, we're going to get into this economic news.
[00:45:09.594 --> 00:45:10.834]  It's obviously very, very important.
[00:45:10.854 --> 00:45:12.775]  And folks, I forgot to cover this yesterday.
[00:45:12.875 --> 00:45:13.416]  I mentioned it.
[00:45:13.856 --> 00:45:15.917]  Can I have the article on the Financial Times of London?
[00:45:16.337 --> 00:45:17.817]  Big banks meet in secret.
[00:45:19.158 --> 00:45:20.379]  Have secret conferences.
[00:45:20.679 --> 00:45:22.440]  See, used to they'd hide those secret conferences.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.981]  Now they go, oh, these are secret conferences for your own good.
[00:45:25.621 --> 00:45:28.522]  I mentioned it, but I never covered it because it ties into all this.
[00:45:29.943 --> 00:45:33.745]  I also want to get into this huge news that I mentioned earlier from Military.com.
[00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:37.430]  Could the U.S.
[00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:39.011]  deploy cyborg troops?
[00:45:40.351 --> 00:45:48.335]  Now remember, if they've got Chimera clones 30 years ago, they started mittering the Chimera clones today.
[00:45:49.515 --> 00:45:52.036]  Part human, part animal, you name it.
[00:45:54.437 --> 00:45:58.879]  They've been putting brain chips in troops that we know of from MIT literature for at least 20 years.
[00:46:00.239 --> 00:46:03.000]  And again, I'm not against a brain chip if you've got epilepsy.
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.900]  I'm not against a brain chip if you've got serious problems.
[00:46:06.421 --> 00:46:08.241]  I'm all for scientific development.
[00:46:08.261 --> 00:46:16.203]  The problem is what back doors are going to be in there if something is ubiquitously applied to whole classes of citizens or jobs.
[00:46:16.243 --> 00:46:21.404]  And they're saying in the near future, you will need a brain chip and a quick, easy surgery.
[00:46:21.444 --> 00:46:21.924]  Don't worry.
[00:46:21.944 --> 00:46:27.826]  It's all being sold as fun PR to be able to do your job in the military.
[00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:35.920]  So, it's the main lining of it.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.421]  Oh, we've got depressed troops.
[00:46:38.041 --> 00:46:42.344]  DARPA started six years ago in planting brain chips in them to make them happy.
[00:46:43.525 --> 00:46:45.746]  You won't be upset anymore once you have your brain chip.
[00:46:46.026 --> 00:46:50.229]  The incredible creepiness, we're gonna cover that after the break that is coming up.
[00:46:50.249 --> 00:47:03.297]  But first, I am very, very excited to introduce AnthroPlex Dietary Foundation for Men Dietary Supplement 60 Caplets.
[00:47:05.202 --> 00:47:16.504]  This came about, well, I'll just be completely honest with you, it's not bad to be honest, it's just it's probably not the clearest pitch in the world for a product, but all I can do is tell the truth.
[00:47:17.184 --> 00:47:28.906]  I said, listen, I know that it cost a lot to have the wet herbs, recently sourced, totally organic, passing California standards, which almost no one else is even able to do.
[00:47:28.966 --> 00:47:31.187]  We have the test up at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:31.207 --> 00:47:32.607]  This is a new product we're rolling out.
[00:47:34.167 --> 00:47:37.270]  Anthroplex, this is a year in the making to finally get this done.
[00:47:38.111 --> 00:47:41.453]  I said, this isn't too expensive for super male or female vitality.
[00:47:41.834 --> 00:47:44.796]  Comparable brands are about 30 to 40% more.
[00:47:45.417 --> 00:47:46.998]  And they're not even cold herbs.
[00:47:48.119 --> 00:47:50.081]  They're not even cold pressed wet herbs.
[00:47:50.882 --> 00:47:51.923]  This is an oil, folks.
[00:47:51.983 --> 00:47:53.344]  It's so thick and so concentrated.
[00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:59.109]  I said, I want something that is less expensive.
[00:48:00.749 --> 00:48:04.552]  And we can put it up on screen so folks can see the price.
[00:48:04.572 --> 00:48:05.954]  But $29.95.
[00:48:06.494 --> 00:48:07.715]  Discounted out of the gate.
[00:48:07.815 --> 00:48:08.756]  It's normally $39.95.
[00:48:10.057 --> 00:48:22.968]  This is a Bentley or Rolls-Royce quality men or female enhancement for stamina, overall mood, libido.
[00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:25.115]  Muscles, you name it.
[00:48:25.195 --> 00:48:28.856]  I've been taking it for six months before it was mass-produced.
[00:48:29.777 --> 00:48:34.959]  And I will tell you that I don't take it every day with Supermail because it's so strong.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.080]  But here's what it comes down to.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:42.163]  I said, I want to have something that is less expensive but from organic dry herbs.
[00:48:45.086 --> 00:48:45.166]  Yes.
[00:49:07.247 --> 00:49:08.308]  This is like a year and a half ago.
[00:49:08.348 --> 00:49:15.892]  He goes, there are some foundational things that are really good that if people don't have those, then this other formula won't work as well.
[00:49:16.133 --> 00:49:23.717]  So together they work even better, but you can't really mix these herbs together in the same oil-based tincture because they are dry herbs.
[00:49:23.998 --> 00:49:28.981]  He goes, so this is just as good or better in ways, but the two work in synergy together.
[00:49:30.662 --> 00:49:33.844]  And so that's what Anthroplex does.
[00:49:35.838 --> 00:49:45.264]  This is the new launch, the new rollout, introducing AnthroPlex, the twice-daily pill formulated for men and women that is perfect pair to super male or super female vitality.
[00:49:45.325 --> 00:49:58.994]  AnthroPlex synergistically works with super male vitality by using key ingredients that you have been asking for, like horny goat weed, that's just the name of it, folks, and there's a reason it has that name, zinc orotate, and newly balanced blend of other organic herbs.
[00:49:59.014 --> 00:50:00.415]  Yeah, it's that complex that's key.
[00:50:00.835 --> 00:50:05.098]  AnthroPlex was created to help restore your masculine foundation and stimulate
[00:50:05.638 --> 00:50:06.478]  We're good to go.
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:36.721]  A hundred years ago, they know.
[00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:37.701]  I mean, they've got the studies.
[00:50:37.741 --> 00:50:39.422]  You're talking like 800, 1,000.
[00:50:39.902 --> 00:50:41.563]  The average man's like 300 now.
[00:50:41.724 --> 00:50:44.725]  Like, an 80-year-old man's supposed to have that much testosterone.
[00:50:45.146 --> 00:50:50.008]  Visit Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle of AnthroPlex before we sell this limited first run.

[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.260]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.781]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:51:42.101 --> 00:51:43.381]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:51:43.741 --> 00:51:46.082]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:51:46.562 --> 00:51:48.422]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:51:48.862 --> 00:51:52.903]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[00:52:11.632 --> 00:52:20.996]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[00:52:21.276 --> 00:52:23.857]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[00:52:23.877 --> 00:52:27.338]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[00:52:27.539 --> 00:52:33.561]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[00:52:33.861 --> 00:52:38.623]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[00:52:38.923 --> 00:52:45.085]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[00:52:45.305 --> 00:52:52.768]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.

[00:54:12.278 --> 00:54:19.242]  Alright, I'm going to jump right into this Brainship News, and then we've got Rand Paul announcing he's dropping out of the race so he can battle for his Kentucky seat and more.
[00:54:19.263 --> 00:54:29.569]  But briefly, going back to Anthroplex, this is a premium formula that blows away most of the competition out there for a much, much, much lower price.
[00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:39.556]  And I'm really, really proud of it because everything we try to bring you is something that is new and original, but also based on deep research fused with ancient knowledge.
[00:54:40.649 --> 00:54:48.112]  So we basically soup up a lot of older formulas but also adding the latest formulas in with it.
[00:54:48.872 --> 00:54:50.273]  That's why there's such rave reviews.
[00:54:50.813 --> 00:54:55.695]  Anthraplex, folks, you know, I went to a doctor about a year ago to have my blood tested.
[00:54:55.895 --> 00:55:00.597]  I was 41 and to basically have a physical done.
[00:55:01.656 --> 00:55:04.859]  And then just at the end of it, he said, hey, you want some Cialis or something?
[00:55:04.879 --> 00:55:06.901]  You know, you're a married guy, whatever.
[00:55:06.921 --> 00:55:10.764]  And I said, you know, I really don't have any issues with functionality or anything.
[00:55:10.784 --> 00:55:14.728]  It's a family show, but let's grow up and get serious about our bodies and our life.
[00:55:15.309 --> 00:55:17.170]  And he said, oh, you might have some fun on the weekend.
[00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:18.772]  I'm going to give you a prescription to Cialis.
[00:55:19.633 --> 00:55:21.394]  And I didn't really notice very much.
[00:55:22.495 --> 00:55:24.237]  Maybe it's because I don't have issues.
[00:55:26.989 --> 00:55:33.932]  Super Mel Vitality, the first time I took it four years ago, six months before it was released, it was like, what on earth is happening?
[00:55:33.952 --> 00:55:35.092]  Am I 20 years old again?
[00:55:37.153 --> 00:55:45.596]  And then I take an Anthroplex and it's so strong, folks, that I'm scared to take two tablets and that's what most people take.
[00:55:45.636 --> 00:55:48.297]  Now, it varies per person, but let me just give you a newsflash.
[00:55:49.317 --> 00:55:50.758]  This is not something to play around with.
[00:55:52.165 --> 00:56:02.277]  I was talking to Tim Frugier who buys pills at the gas station that, you know, are like $25, basically the price of this, that have less milligrams of one ingredient that's in each pill of this.
[00:56:02.738 --> 00:56:09.746]  People pay $25, $10, whatever, at the gas station, you know, for the two pills, and boy do they work!
[00:56:10.717 --> 00:56:12.898]  This has more than the gas station pills.
[00:56:13.179 --> 00:56:23.225]  In fact, I intend to do an ad where I walk into the gas station, you know, into some, you know, gas station and pick up the people's pills and show what it cost and the milligrams and then what this has got.
[00:56:25.066 --> 00:56:25.627]  It's crazy.
[00:56:25.667 --> 00:56:28.209]  They'd sell that for $10, $12, sometimes $25.
[00:56:28.249 --> 00:56:35.473]  But see, people think it must be really good if it's $25 for two pills.
[00:56:36.434 --> 00:56:38.355]  In fact, that's even a marketing tactic some people have.
[00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:39.276]  I just don't do that.
[00:56:40.438 --> 00:56:53.850]  I was told by a nutraceutical company that they sell something similar to DNA Force for $500 a bottle, or about five, six times what we do, and they sell more because it just has a huge price tag.
[00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:55.291]  I don't get the psychology.
[00:56:56.092 --> 00:56:56.893]  This is 60 pills for $29.95.
[00:57:02.378 --> 00:57:02.478]  And
[00:57:19.676 --> 00:57:20.896]  It's not just libido, folks.
[00:57:20.956 --> 00:57:22.097]  It's the way it makes you feel.
[00:57:22.337 --> 00:57:23.797]  These are such incredible products.
[00:57:24.037 --> 00:57:27.118]  And out of the gate, it's 15% off, and your purchase makes it all possible.
[00:57:27.378 --> 00:57:32.700]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:33.520]  Okay, I'm done.
[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.760]  I usually only plug once an hour, but it's a new product.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:38.001]  I kind of went off the deep end there, but it's so exciting.
[00:57:38.941 --> 00:57:41.402]  When we come back, Rand Paul is obviously
[00:57:42.748 --> 00:57:50.298]  Dropped out and it's it's very very sad he did that because I wanted to still be in the debates to inject great ideas But he's so credible.
[00:57:50.779 --> 00:57:51.680]  He's so real.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:58.589]  He's so unfake so uncalculated From what I've known that he could stop spending money
[00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:05.592]  He could stop spending time and energy and just go to the debates, but he knows he'd probably be thrown out of those soon because he'd drop in the polls.
[00:58:06.272 --> 00:58:08.533]  So maybe he's doing the right thing, but he is suspending his campaign.
[00:58:08.573 --> 00:58:10.033]  I would have loved to kept him in the debates.
[00:58:10.613 --> 00:58:11.673]  Others could fall off.
[00:58:11.894 --> 00:58:12.874]  Scandals could come out.
[00:58:15.455 --> 00:58:17.375]  I wish he wasn't dropping out, but here's the problem.
[00:58:17.695 --> 00:58:19.136]  The system hates him so much.
[00:58:19.176 --> 00:58:26.738]  They've got big Republican and big Democrat money in Kentucky for the last few years, organizing to take him out and dirty tricks and you name it.
[00:58:27.933 --> 00:58:31.935]  And so he has to go defend his Kentucky Senate seat, and he's probably right to do that.
[00:58:32.835 --> 00:58:38.417]  I just wish he'd have been more hardcore early on in the last year to stay in the front-runner seat.
[00:58:38.457 --> 00:58:41.278]  But he gave a powerful speech breaking down why he's leaving.
[00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:45.740]  We'll get to that, and then we'll get to the brain chips, which they're announcing for U.S.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:46.200]  military.
[00:58:50.322 --> 00:58:51.502]  See how suddenly it would never come?
[00:58:51.542 --> 00:58:52.943]  Now we're just, oh yeah, brain chips, oh yeah.

[01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:06.113]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:21.501 --> 01:00:26.624]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:27.164 --> 01:00:29.406]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.224 --> 01:00:42.496]  I got in the studio a little bit late because Austin Police Chief and his eight-foot-tall assistant are in the control room here.
[01:00:42.536 --> 01:00:48.023]  Let's cut to Art Acevedo, Austin Police Chief for TV viewers, standing by George Washington.
[01:00:48.905 --> 01:00:49.346]  There you go.
[01:00:49.406 --> 01:00:53.731]  We can cut to that shot and show him standing by George Washington over there.
[01:00:54.872 --> 01:00:56.614]  I didn't know he's been trying to call me lately.
[01:00:56.815 --> 01:00:58.697]  He must have my old cell phone number or something.
[01:00:58.737 --> 01:01:03.042]  I had to discard my other cell phone because they gave it out all over the internet.
[01:01:03.523 --> 01:01:04.424]  But he's going to be joining us.
[01:01:04.444 --> 01:01:06.987]  We're going to punch it up and show him in the control room in a moment.
[01:01:08.068 --> 01:01:09.049]  If we're able to do that.
[01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:19.078]  But we're going to be discussing with him the whole waterfront of things happening in the world, the election, the Second Amendment, where he thinks the future of policing is going.
[01:01:19.138 --> 01:01:23.942]  Is it going to be all militarized or will it truly be community policing, Black Lives Matter?
[01:01:24.623 --> 01:01:26.124]  It is all coming up.
[01:01:26.864 --> 01:01:28.986]  You guys can't give me a shot in there?
[01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:31.960]  Oh, he got a phone call.
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.901]  I wonder why he ran off.
[01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:38.888]  He's usually right on time when he gets here, and then I saw him kind of run out of there, so I thought he was running to another camera or something.
[01:01:39.248 --> 01:01:40.650]  Well, let's cut to Nico in there.
[01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:43.132]  Nico, how are you doing there in the control room?
[01:01:44.574 --> 01:01:45.095]  Is the mic open?
[01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:46.826]  I'm doing well.
[01:01:46.966 --> 01:01:47.286]  How are you?
[01:01:47.606 --> 01:01:49.607]  You know, I'll tell you my problem.
[01:01:49.787 --> 01:01:53.408]  I don't go to the crew enough to where they're even, you know, kind of used to it.
[01:01:53.468 --> 01:01:56.348]  So that's why we're more and more going to start talking to the crew on a routine basis.
[01:01:56.908 --> 01:01:58.829]  But getting serious, we're going to go to break here in a moment.
[01:01:59.109 --> 01:02:06.430]  But first, this is Rand Paul saying that he is leaving the campaign to go back and defend his Kentucky seat.
[01:02:06.931 --> 01:02:08.491]  So here is the senator.
[01:02:09.465 --> 01:02:13.547]  It's been an honor to participate in the 2016 Republican presidential primary.
[01:02:13.567 --> 01:02:22.391]  I'm proud of our Prince of Old campaign and the thousands of young people that have been energized by our message of limited constitutional government.
[01:02:23.151 --> 01:02:31.895]  Ours has been a unique voice in this race, one that says big government threatens Americans from all walks of life, rich and poor, black and white,
[01:02:32.455 --> 01:02:47.925]  From the coal miner who lost his job over President Obama's destructive EPA regulations, to the teenager from a poor family facing jail time for marijuana, I will continue to fight for criminal justice reform, for privacy, and your Fourth Amendment rights.
[01:02:48.326 --> 01:02:52.949]  I will continue to champion due process over indefinite detention.
[01:02:53.789 --> 01:03:03.274]  I will continue to be a voice against the out-of-control regulation, spending, and debt that is crippling our country's economy and the future of our children.
[01:03:04.014 --> 01:03:12.979]  I will not ignore the terrible cost of decades of war and chaos in the Middle East and the unintended consequences of regime change and nation-building.
[01:03:13.699 --> 01:03:22.504]  I will never forget the thousands of American soldiers who have given their lives and the thousands more who live every day with catastrophic injuries.
[01:03:23.644 --> 01:03:26.147]  These are the issues that have defined my campaign.
[01:03:27.909 --> 01:03:34.677]  Kelly and I are deeply grateful to our outstanding staff and tireless volunteers and supporters, people who believe in liberty.
[01:03:35.398 --> 01:03:41.745]  It has been a privilege to give voice to the liberty movement in this race, and I believe we have broadened the debate by being part of it.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:52.264]  Although today I will suspend my campaign for the presidency, I will continue to fight on for liberty, for the Constitution, for justice in the United States Senate.
[01:03:52.884 --> 01:03:54.785]  Thank you, and God bless America.
[01:04:04.582 --> 01:04:06.562]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:06.602 --> 01:04:12.264]  There is Senator Rand Paul saying bye-bye and that he's not going to be running for president anymore.
[01:04:12.864 --> 01:04:14.584]  I personally think it overall is a mistake.
[01:04:14.624 --> 01:04:28.107]  He should stay in the campaign a while just for the political attention and then talk about what's happening in Kentucky because that's where they're trying to unseat him there, both political parties, which is a real endorsement of Senator Rand Paul that both political parties are against him.
[01:04:28.747 --> 01:04:31.368]  Both political parties are also against Ted Cruz to a great extent.
[01:04:32.108 --> 01:04:34.350]  But who they're really against is Donald Trump.
[01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:40.094]  And when you see the power structure against somebody, you can better believe that that means that overall they're good.
[01:04:40.154 --> 01:04:44.577]  Because we know the path we've been going down for a long time is a bad one.
[01:04:44.697 --> 01:04:46.439]  Why not change to something else?
[01:04:46.459 --> 01:04:50.021]  And we know Hillary and Jeb Bush are not that change, obviously.
[01:04:50.642 --> 01:04:51.302]  But there you go.
[01:04:51.362 --> 01:04:52.763]  He's going back to fight for his seat.
[01:04:53.064 --> 01:04:54.445]  Now, right here, Arte Saavedra.
[01:04:54.825 --> 01:04:57.827]  We have the Austin Police Chief in here, in studio with us.
[01:04:57.847 --> 01:05:00.129]  We're going to be discussing the waterfront with him.
[01:05:00.569 --> 01:05:03.191]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:05:09.122 --> 01:05:11.423]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:05:11.563 --> 01:05:20.726]  Now I continue to see college kids all across the country going around protesting, saying that they demand $15 raise for minimum wage.
[01:05:21.046 --> 01:05:21.746]  And what did I say?
[01:05:22.067 --> 01:05:23.607]  Well, you're going to continue to do that.
[01:05:23.667 --> 01:05:24.908]  And guess what companies are going to do?
[01:05:25.108 --> 01:05:27.128]  They're going to fire you and hire a robot.
[01:05:27.168 --> 01:05:28.449]  Then they don't have to pay anybody.
[01:05:28.469 --> 01:05:32.550]  And that robot can quadruple their work, do it for 24 hours straight.
[01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:33.491]  They don't need a lunch break.
[01:05:33.511 --> 01:05:34.451]  They don't need anything like that.
[01:05:34.691 --> 01:05:35.452]  And well, guess what?
[01:05:35.492 --> 01:05:36.112]  It's finally here.
[01:05:36.312 --> 01:05:42.037]  Article by Tech Insider, these four-foot-tall robots could change the way warehouse workers do their job.
[01:05:42.117 --> 01:05:43.898]  And it's not just going to be warehouse workers.
[01:05:44.018 --> 01:05:46.940]  It's going to be the people at Burger King, at McDonald's, all over the place.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.324]  The Locus robot can zip around a clothing warehouse larger than the size of six football fields.
[01:05:51.464 --> 01:05:55.907]  It can also work for 24 hours without a break for lunch or a salary.
[01:05:56.007 --> 01:06:03.813]  The new bot created by Locus Robotics just launched in its first warehouse, a Devens, Massachusetts, space owned by Quiet Logistics.

[01:07:08.753 --> 01:07:12.474]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:07:12.714 --> 01:07:18.836]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:07:19.037 --> 01:07:26.019]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:07:26.319 --> 01:07:35.122]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:07:35.422 --> 01:07:41.366]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:07:41.606 --> 01:07:46.370]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:49.792]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:51.654]  No needles, no injections.
[01:07:51.914 --> 01:07:53.415]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:07:53.555 --> 01:07:54.596]  Try it for yourself.

[01:08:11.885 --> 01:08:17.907]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:21.508]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:34.074 --> 01:08:42.803]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we have the Austin Police Chief, Art Acevedo, a very interesting fellow here in studio with us for The Balance of the Hour.
[01:08:42.823 --> 01:08:44.685]  We're just in here turning up his audio.
[01:08:45.006 --> 01:08:48.329]  And the reason I like having him in studio is he'll come in studio.
[01:08:49.911 --> 01:08:52.693]  Other Austin Police Chiefs that I ran into weren't really bad people.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:59.502]  But they were very cloistered, let's say, kind of up in their high tower, and were really kind of afraid of the media.
[01:09:00.142 --> 01:09:05.244]  Art, you have not been afraid of the media, and you have a very, very interesting past.
[01:09:05.944 --> 01:09:13.226]  Of course, you're a Cuban immigrant to this country fleeing Fidel Castro, and so that's why you've always pointed out to me that, you know, you love liberty and freedom.
[01:09:13.547 --> 01:09:17.868]  So it's good to have you here with us, but you're also a popular police chief across the country.
[01:09:18.288 --> 01:09:20.289]  And I've got to say, as Austin's grown,
[01:09:21.449 --> 01:09:32.034]  Normally, they say police departments get worse as they get bigger because it's hard to control them, but I've really got to say it's true, and I think the press says it, the public say it, that Austin is a model police department.
[01:09:32.374 --> 01:09:32.874]  Well, thank you.
[01:09:32.894 --> 01:09:39.277]  That means a lot to me, especially coming from a person that has been a watchdog of government for his entire adult life.
[01:09:39.977 --> 01:09:40.957]  We're definitely not perfect.
[01:09:41.058 --> 01:09:48.261]  We know we have our issues, we have our challenges, but by and large, I wouldn't trade these officers for any in the country.
[01:09:48.421 --> 01:09:49.061]  They're phenomenal.
[01:09:49.301 --> 01:09:50.182]  Well, you got in some trouble.
[01:09:50.242 --> 01:09:51.343]  I mean, not a lot of trouble a few years ago.
[01:09:51.363 --> 01:09:54.187]  And you said, listen, at least our police aren't shooting people in the back every day.
[01:09:54.207 --> 01:09:56.009]  You know, talking about other departments.
[01:09:56.069 --> 01:10:07.883]  And again, other departments, I'm not even attacking them, but compared to a lot of these other departments, Austin also has really nice police on average, but they also, you know, tend to do their jobs at the same time compared to other cities I've been in.
[01:10:08.311 --> 01:10:09.952]  Yeah, I mean, and it's important.
[01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:14.235]  You know, the city of Austin is a progressive city.
[01:10:14.295 --> 01:10:15.276]  It's a successful city.
[01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:19.659]  It's a community that's very much engaged, as you know, in this entire region.
[01:10:19.699 --> 01:10:24.782]  And Texans, I think, take their liberty very seriously, as should all Americans.
[01:10:24.862 --> 01:10:28.945]  And so, you know, we're held to a pretty high standard as an organization.
[01:10:28.985 --> 01:10:36.350]  And our officers take a lot of pride working in a department where they know that we're not going to set the bar high and talk about it.
[01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:37.671]  We're going to enforce that standard.
[01:10:38.611 --> 01:10:48.337]  Yeah, it's been eight and a half years that I've been here now, and I still remember the first time I came here and met you, and you know, remember we all reached out, and like, nobody didn't think I should come.
[01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:50.819]  Why wouldn't I come and talk to you?
[01:10:50.839 --> 01:10:53.060]  I think that transparency is important.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:11:01.526]  I think engagement is important, and we don't have to agree on everything, but at least we should know where you're a police chief, and whether you agree with me or not, at least you'll know where I stand on issues.
[01:11:01.994 --> 01:11:10.221]  Well, when I say cover the waterfront, I want to go wherever you want to go, and I also have some tough questions about policing, but also, I want to just look at numbers.
[01:11:10.281 --> 01:11:11.822]  And I've got a whole stack of articles here.
[01:11:11.882 --> 01:11:18.748]  The listeners see these stories and hear these stories every few weeks, but I'm going to actually bibliograph these and go over the headlines in a moment.
[01:11:20.816 --> 01:11:25.838]  We've got about 12,400 gun deaths a year out of 340-something million people.
[01:11:27.498 --> 01:11:32.720]  Death by guns is very, very rare compared to many other forms of death, like drowning or being hit by a car.
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:43.764]  7,000-plus of those, and I have the numbers, we can put up the Justice Department numbers on screen, showing crimes gone down using guns, 50-plus percent since 1992, Justice Department's own numbers.
[01:11:44.224 --> 01:11:49.046]  You've got 7,000-plus kill themselves with guns, so then you've got less than 5,000 other deaths
[01:11:50.626 --> 01:12:02.839]  And most of those are criminals getting shot, and then you've got a couple thousand that are questionable, and maybe a thousand of those are cops shooting people, and maybe 150 of those are the police in the wrong on the high end.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:10.308]  So it's a hoax that there's this epidemic of gun crime, but it's also a hoax, the numbers don't lie, that police are killing people in cold blood.
[01:12:10.788 --> 01:12:13.030]  Now, but people can't have it both ways.
[01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:22.960]  You can't then be pro-gun and say, see, gun crime's way down, but oh my gosh, you know, the police are demons, but you also can't say the police are demons, but guns are saving everybody.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.842]  So where do you stand on those numbers?
[01:12:25.635 --> 01:12:34.560]  Well, first of all, the numbers that I'm familiar with, that I've seen, is over 30,000 Americans die from gunshots every year.
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:41.004]  That includes accidental, that includes suicides, and that includes intentional gunfire.
[01:12:41.744 --> 01:12:44.946]  And so, you know, I mean, that's a lot of people that are dying.
[01:12:45.006 --> 01:12:46.887]  And the other day I saw an article where
[01:12:48.508 --> 01:12:55.550]  The accidental deaths of children that gunfire from kids getting their hands on guns is going up.
[01:12:55.650 --> 01:13:08.635]  And I think that to me, you know, some people think that because I don't believe that just anybody should have a gun, that only law-abiding Americans with sound minds should have firearms, that I'm anti-Second Amendment.
[01:13:09.075 --> 01:13:13.016]  But I do believe in the Second Amendment, but I believe that with rights come responsibilities,
[01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:22.863]  And when children get their hands on a gun because parents aren't keeping them secure and they end up accidentally shooting themselves or a playmate, you know, the gun isn't the issue.
[01:13:23.043 --> 01:13:24.664]  It's irresponsible adults.
[01:13:25.405 --> 01:13:29.007]  And so that's what I focus on my efforts.
[01:13:29.027 --> 01:13:31.209]  Well, it varies a lot because I was going...
[01:13:31.829 --> 01:13:43.913]  With numbers, before the suicide rate exploded, they just put it on screen, of the 20-something thousand gun deaths a year, depending on which number you look at, that's the Pew Research Center, 19,000 plus are suicides.
[01:13:43.933 --> 01:13:46.534]  So my point is, the vast majority is suicide.
[01:13:46.814 --> 01:13:48.334]  That's their choice to take their own life.
[01:13:48.655 --> 01:13:55.897]  I'm not saying it's a good thing, but out of 300-plus million people, guns are still one of the more rare forms of death.
[01:13:57.472 --> 01:14:07.755]  Well, I mean, we also have data that showed that last year we had about 378 what was called multiple victim shootings where you have four or more people.
[01:14:07.815 --> 01:14:09.116]  But weren't most of those gang related?
[01:14:09.136 --> 01:14:10.076]  I mean, that's not good.
[01:14:10.296 --> 01:14:12.697]  Yeah, I mean, a lot of them are criminals.
[01:14:13.017 --> 01:14:23.300]  And so, again, I think that the way that we protect gun rights, the way we protect the Second Amendment is that we as a society should do everything we can to keep those guns in the right hands.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.901]  And that's in the hands of law abiding Americans of sound mind.
[01:14:26.001 --> 01:14:27.402]  Well, here's what I was getting at, though.
[01:14:27.823 --> 01:14:30.485]  I'm not even defending police in general, I'm defending the facts.
[01:14:31.025 --> 01:14:34.828]  You might have 150 people, depending on how you look at the numbers, say 200, say 100.
[01:14:34.868 --> 01:14:36.049]  These numbers all vary every year.
[01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:38.801]  Yeah.
[01:14:38.821 --> 01:14:38.921]  Okay.
[01:14:59.605 --> 01:15:03.650]  Maybe 1,500 people a year, and then maybe 150 or so are in the wrong.
[01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:05.191]  That's a high number from our research.
[01:15:05.552 --> 01:15:09.436]  So all I'm saying is, just like guns are being scapegoated, police are being scapegoated.
[01:15:09.636 --> 01:15:13.741]  Now, you seem to know the numbers, the latest ones, because new numbers just came out.
[01:15:13.801 --> 01:15:14.642]  We checked what you said.
[01:15:14.662 --> 01:15:15.142]  We pulled them up.
[01:15:15.182 --> 01:15:15.783]  It was accurate.
[01:15:16.724 --> 01:15:18.666]  What numbers do you have on police shootings every year?
[01:15:18.766 --> 01:15:19.927]  Well, here's part of the challenge.
[01:15:20.988 --> 01:15:30.855]  First, there's a false narrative that is being, I think, promoted by some folks in the media that there are about 800,000 police officers representing 18,000 police departments.
[01:15:31.355 --> 01:15:38.300]  And there's this narrative that police officers, you would think that are every day just going around whacking people with firearms, and it's simply not true.
[01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:44.625]  We have 800,000 cops representing about 18,000 police departments, and the facts still remain
[01:15:45.205 --> 01:15:50.030]  That the very, very vast majority of police officers will serve anywhere from 25 to 30 years.
[01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:53.353]  They'll never shoot at or shoot anybody.
[01:15:53.793 --> 01:15:55.215]  And they'll never seriously injure anybody.
[01:15:55.315 --> 01:15:57.737]  That's an absolute truth today.
[01:15:57.917 --> 01:15:59.018]  But here's the problem, Alex.
[01:15:59.739 --> 01:16:00.880]  We're not gathering data.
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:02.602]  You know, what's really frustrating is that the government...
[01:16:03.923 --> 01:16:10.966]  The government has data on everything and somehow we're not requiring police departments to report their use of force.
[01:16:11.266 --> 01:16:21.991]  I'm very proud of the fact if you go to the Austin Police Department's website, you will see our use of force, you will see our shootings, you will see everything on there because at the end of the day, data belongs to the community.
[01:16:22.031 --> 01:16:30.934]  Sure, what I'm getting at is, I don't like all the acid forwards for seizure, the whole drug war is a fraud because big banks and parts of our federal government have been caught shipping the drugs in.
[01:16:31.454 --> 01:16:32.535]  We can debate that if you want.
[01:16:33.015 --> 01:16:33.976]  I'm against the whole drug war.
[01:16:33.996 --> 01:16:36.358]  I'm against some of the things police are directed to do.
[01:16:37.419 --> 01:16:48.268]  But at the same time, to sit there with these incidences on TV, to hype up the public, to create this culture of war with the police, has an in-game reason.
[01:16:48.508 --> 01:16:59.197]  And people like George Soros are funding it to make political rebellion in America be against the grassroots instead of getting the federal government back under control.
[01:16:59.257 --> 01:17:00.718]  Now, I know you're not an enemy of the federal government.
[01:17:01.058 --> 01:17:01.699]  I'm not either.
[01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:09.865]  But clearly there's a move, and I know you're more of a Democrat in this city, but there is a Democrat move to make... You called me a Democrat?
[01:17:10.085 --> 01:17:11.546]  Well, no, I'm just saying it's a Democrat city.
[01:17:11.746 --> 01:17:12.287]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:12.627 --> 01:17:13.507]  Safe to get along with them.
[01:17:13.728 --> 01:17:17.210]  Okay, well, are you a Democrat or a Republican as a Prime Minister?
[01:17:17.911 --> 01:17:22.074]  I'm a center-right person, but I think life's about balance.
[01:17:22.894 --> 01:17:38.200]  I think that for me the problem with our government sometimes is that people are on these extreme silos on both sides of the aisle and people don't want to work with each other and it's in our nature as human beings to want to work with each
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:39.361]  No, no, I understand that.
[01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:40.441]  But I mean, let's get to it then.
[01:17:40.641 --> 01:18:01.251]  What I'm saying is, do you agree with me that there's a clear agenda in the last seven years to scapegoat the police and local government and create a lot of tension that then the big foundations and Al Sharpton and the White House admittedly are running with George Soros, $35 million alone, in Ferguson alone, to hype that up.
[01:18:02.331 --> 01:18:03.912]  They want to change the subject onto that.
[01:18:04.895 --> 01:18:24.908]  Well, I don't know if there's... I don't know, because I'm not familiar with that funding, what you're talking about, but I do know that the media keeps trying to paint a picture of American law enforcement police officers being these out-of-control goons when, in fact, police officers are better trained, better equipped, more professional, better educated today than they've ever been.
[01:18:25.768 --> 01:18:29.791]  Having said that, there's still some bad policing going on, and you cannot deny... Sure, of course there is.
[01:18:29.831 --> 01:18:30.972]  ...that there's some bad policing.
[01:18:31.032 --> 01:18:33.854]  So I'm asking the question, and if you agree that there's this demonization going on,
[01:18:34.714 --> 01:18:36.176]  What do you think the endgame is?
[01:18:36.316 --> 01:18:37.757]  It's not just media for ratings.
[01:18:38.518 --> 01:18:48.887]  Because I've, you know, cut my teeth criticizing the police and going over all that, and I still do when it's needed, until I realize it's a scapegoat from keeping people from being politically involved and changing the system.
[01:18:49.307 --> 01:19:00.758]  Instead, let's just have riots in every city, then the feds come in and federalize the police, which is what Al Sharpton said the White House plan is, with this whole UN-run Strong Cities Initiative.
[01:19:01.513 --> 01:19:17.474]  Well I can tell you that local control is a long-standing practice in this country and folks like to have control over their own communities and so it would be against
[01:19:19.536 --> 01:19:33.821]  The history of this country, the history of this nation, where communities want to be able to establish their own priorities, you know, what's important to them, and so I don't see, regardless of whether somebody has an agenda or not, I don't see it happening in our lifetime.
[01:19:33.861 --> 01:19:35.261]  Okay, well let me ask you this question then.
[01:19:36.202 --> 01:19:44.244]  Why do you think there would be an agenda on the left to make their number one political issue be about the police?
[01:19:44.604 --> 01:19:45.725]  We're going to skip this network break.
[01:19:46.584 --> 01:19:47.004]  Well, I don't know.
[01:19:47.024 --> 01:19:48.365]  I don't know if that's on their agenda or not.
[01:19:48.426 --> 01:20:03.958]  I can tell you that one of the things that I'm working with, which is called the Public Data Initiative with the White House, that I'm part of that initiative, is trying to provide as much data to the public as we can in terms of use of force, racial profiling, all those things.
[01:20:04.378 --> 01:20:05.960]  And in my conversations with
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.001]  The White House.
[01:20:24.694 --> 01:20:29.815]  And I think you would agree with this that the vast majority of police officers in this country are honorable professionals.
[01:20:30.296 --> 01:20:40.378]  And I think that the more data that we provide to the communities we serve, that that will be the number one proof and the evidence is the data.
[01:20:40.418 --> 01:20:43.239]  And I think that the American people will make that same conclusion.
[01:20:43.539 --> 01:20:46.663]  We have a little data package that is Justice Department numbers.
[01:20:46.703 --> 01:20:50.608]  If you guys can find that and just kind of run it for TV viewers, I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[01:20:50.948 --> 01:21:01.581]  But it does show the Justice Department's numbers, the FBI numbers, from 92 until 2012, that's when the latest numbers came in, of a 50 plus percent drop in crime using guns.
[01:21:02.322 --> 01:21:07.985]  Uh, from 30-something thousand, uh, pre-1992 a year, uh, to 12,000 to 15,000.
[01:21:08.286 --> 01:21:14.329]  You were showing me some numbers where suicides up, and I'd forgotten that as the economy goes down, you're going to see more suicide.
[01:21:14.349 --> 01:21:18.972]  Uh, but, but just massive reductions, uh, in overall gun crime.
[01:21:18.992 --> 01:21:22.974]  We can also show the LA Times, gun crime way down, public thinks it's up.
[01:21:23.014 --> 01:21:29.578]  Kind of like when a new Jaws movie would come out, the public would think that, you know, great white sharks were eating everybody, but they eat about five people a year.
[01:21:30.018 --> 01:21:34.045]  I know that when that movie came out as a kid, I made sure there was always somebody deeper than me out in the ocean.
[01:21:34.265 --> 01:21:34.966]  See, there you go!
[01:21:35.026 --> 01:21:37.350]  Just in case, you gotta have that little... See, see, look!
[01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:37.790]  Look!
[01:21:38.071 --> 01:21:38.772]  Look, Chief, right there.
[01:21:39.052 --> 01:21:41.516]  Gun crime is plunged, but Americans think it's stop study, sis.
[01:21:42.352 --> 01:21:43.973]  Yeah, but that's two years ago.
[01:21:44.594 --> 01:21:45.814]  That's the May 7, 2013.
[01:21:46.395 --> 01:21:53.640]  And actually, there's a little discussion right now on the national level amongst local police chiefs about there has been some spikes recently.
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:57.503]  I agree, because the economy's falling apart.
[01:21:57.583 --> 01:22:00.725]  The question is, some are saying the economy may not be doing as well.
[01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:06.369]  Others are saying that police officers are de-policing, which is a phenomenon, police officers.
[01:22:06.549 --> 01:22:08.190]  The opposite of profiling.
[01:22:08.210 --> 01:22:09.591]  They're just saying, yeah, I'm profiling.
[01:22:09.611 --> 01:22:10.472]  I'm not going to that neighborhood.
[01:22:10.712 --> 01:22:12.212]  Well, there... Well, tell us about that.
[01:22:12.352 --> 01:22:34.137]  Well, I mean, some police chiefs are, and some... There's a debate as to whether or not police officers, because of the constant barrage of criticism around the nation, that some are asking, is there policing going on, which is the phenomenon where officers become risk-averse and
[01:22:35.197 --> 01:22:38.019]  Well, as you know, statistics come out every few years, not every year.
[01:22:38.039 --> 01:22:40.340]  We're waiting for new numbers to come out, and I agree with you.
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:43.782]  Just looking at the news, robberies, things like that, have gone up some.
[01:22:44.503 --> 01:22:46.664]  Still, they're way down from the 90s and 80s.
[01:23:03.674 --> 01:23:05.395]  From historic... But they're starting to come up a little bit.
[01:23:05.415 --> 01:23:06.796]  But they're starting to come up, yeah.
[01:23:06.876 --> 01:23:15.999]  So if you look at the long-term data, it's still down, but it is coming up from what it's been in recent years.
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:18.861]  And so you never want to see violent crime going up.
[01:23:18.921 --> 01:23:20.922]  And so the question is, is it the economy?
[01:23:21.962 --> 01:23:23.963]  Is it de-policing?
[01:23:24.363 --> 01:23:26.404]  And that's what social scientists are debating right now.
[01:23:29.722 --> 01:23:49.849]  Undoubtedly, since the 90s, there's been massive proliferation of gun ownership and concealed carry, and I really don't think overall it can be argued, disagree with me if you think as you're an expert, that overall concealed carry and lawful citizens starting to carry guns has frustrated criminals that would be the type that would carjack and mug people.
[01:23:50.349 --> 01:23:57.071]  Well, I can tell you that, you know, our concealed hiding licensees here are by and large very
[01:23:59.935 --> 01:24:02.859]  Just really responsible gun owners that take it very seriously.
[01:24:03.439 --> 01:24:04.761]  You know, but it's never enough.
[01:24:04.841 --> 01:24:09.046]  And so I really worry about, you know, now we have open carry and now they want constitutional carry.
[01:24:09.086 --> 01:24:13.211]  And, you know, I'm not in favor of constitutional carry and that makes me a communist to a lot of people.
[01:24:13.231 --> 01:24:17.556]  I believe that if you are convicted felon, you should not
[01:24:18.116 --> 01:24:19.958]  You should be prohibited from owning a firearm.
[01:24:20.178 --> 01:24:25.804]  But I also believe that at some point, it depends on the nature of the felony, that you should be able to restore your rights.
[01:24:25.824 --> 01:24:29.708]  I don't think it's just... Sure, because what if it's a white collar bounce a check and you can't own a gun?
[01:24:29.768 --> 01:24:34.092]  Right, so... Well listen, if it was enforced properly, I'm not against felons too.
[01:24:34.473 --> 01:24:36.775]  But the problem is they're always wanting to expand it, expand it.
[01:24:37.175 --> 01:24:40.499]  Plus that slippery slope, but I don't think we should use the fear of the slippery slope
[01:24:44.063 --> 01:24:51.812]  Well, I'll tell you why the establishment left is against the police in general.
[01:24:52.953 --> 01:24:55.976]  They want to demonize it so they can take it over, so they can regulate it.
[01:24:56.097 --> 01:25:00.562]  It's a good cop, bad cop, where one side of the White House is attacking the police and the other side
[01:25:02.677 --> 01:25:03.257]  We're good to go.
[01:25:27.568 --> 01:25:30.009]  When we take over the government, we're gonna deal with it.
[01:25:30.270 --> 01:25:35.933]  And so there's an ingrained animosity in the left, and that's what they're doing, that's what they're pushing.
[01:25:36.233 --> 01:25:41.956]  I have personally seen it in Austin, with the communist brigades and the rest of them coming out and attacking us.
[01:25:42.657 --> 01:25:46.299]  And there's this idea that when the left attacks people, they're just allowed to do it.
[01:25:46.339 --> 01:25:47.920]  And I've never been somebody who was left or right.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:49.001]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:25:49.261 --> 01:25:55.885]  But I gotta tell you, under the left in this country, they are trying to take over the nation, and they know that the average police officer, even if they're
[01:25:56.585 --> 01:26:09.372]  Socially liberal, gets that guns protect us overall nine times out of ten, gets basic common sense, lives in the real world, isn't domesticated, and the nanny state is fundamentally against police.
[01:26:09.712 --> 01:26:14.735]  And when the left is done taking the American citizens' guns, they're then going to try to disarm the police.
[01:26:14.755 --> 01:26:16.916]  And that's actually in these UN treaties.
[01:26:16.956 --> 01:26:21.719]  We have Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo here breaking all this down with us today.
[01:26:21.739 --> 01:26:23.140]  Do you disagree or agree with all that?
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:38.789]  Again, you know, we work very closely with the Obama administration on several initiatives that I really think that the intent of those initiatives is to provide a lot of information and transparency to the communities that we serve.
[01:26:39.469 --> 01:26:48.054]  And to me, that transparency and that information that they're encouraging police departments around the country to provide is going to build trust.
[01:26:48.214 --> 01:26:49.615]  It's going to have the opposite effect.
[01:26:50.075 --> 01:26:54.256]  Well, look, I'm not just here trying to get you to say some zinger attacking the president.
[01:27:19.127 --> 01:27:20.609]  The president's about to be out of office.
[01:27:21.450 --> 01:27:33.426]  Undoubtedly, though, when this whole Black Lives Matter thing gets cranked up, and then three cops in a week get shot in the back of the head, or up in Philadelphia, a jihadi comes up and shoots somebody, or San Bernardino, we see a jihad attack.
[01:27:34.167 --> 01:27:38.049]  When it came out, the FBI was ordered by the White House to not say it was a jihadi.
[01:27:38.329 --> 01:27:40.370]  Now come on, Police Chief Arne Seveda.
[01:27:40.770 --> 01:27:52.635]  Clearly there's an attempt to cover up police murders generally, and not point out their political, and that there's an agenda to shoot cops while they're pumping gas, and there's an agenda to cover up jihad attacks from this administration.
[01:27:53.706 --> 01:28:01.213]  Well, I think that the issue is you don't want to paint something with a broad brush until you have the information.
[01:28:01.233 --> 01:28:10.682]  I think that the FBI initially, having had conversations actually with the director of the FBI initially, we don't want to demonize the Muslim community.
[01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:13.625]  I think that's one of the issues I have as a police chief is that
[01:28:14.561 --> 01:28:27.691]  Uh, that, uh, people become radicalized, whether it's by gang members, by, you know, uh, a right-wing extreme group that want, you know, like this guy that went shooting up my city from the Phineas Priesthood.
[01:28:27.891 --> 01:28:28.732]  No, no, you're right, yeah.
[01:28:28.792 --> 01:28:29.072]  You know.
[01:28:29.372 --> 01:28:36.438]  So you're saying not including them makes them get radicalized, and so that's why we should reach out, just like you've reached out to my show eight years ago.
[01:28:36.738 --> 01:28:39.080]  Go out and pat the radicals on the head, it'll be nice.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:47.024]  You know, listen, everybody, the more we can do as human beings and make people feel welcome and belong, it's important.
[01:28:47.044 --> 01:28:56.289]  I think that with the San Bernardino incident, initially, until you, until the FBI has the ability to actually connect the dots, they don't want to say it's Muslim extremism.
[01:28:56.569 --> 01:28:58.410]  I mean, that could have been workplace violence, right?
[01:28:58.911 --> 01:29:04.574]  But for their religion, that's all we had, is that they were Muslim when the shooting took place.
[01:29:04.894 --> 01:29:08.456]  You know, what's the difference between that and the guy that goes post with the post office that happens to be a guy that looks
[01:29:09.036 --> 01:29:10.357]  A lot like Alex Jones.
[01:29:10.377 --> 01:29:12.258]  Sure, but let's expand on that when we come back, Chief.
[01:29:12.298 --> 01:29:14.199]  Or, I mean, you can keep going for a minute here.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:23.284]  White supremacist groups, groups like the Phineas Priesthood, whatever, I don't care if you demonize them, because those are groups that need to be demonized.
[01:29:23.344 --> 01:29:26.246]  And radical Islam needs to be demonized, because it's horrible.
[01:29:26.406 --> 01:29:27.146]  It's out of control.
[01:29:27.227 --> 01:29:28.887]  And so I don't think it's... Well, absolutely.
[01:29:29.228 --> 01:29:29.648]  Absolutely.
[01:29:29.768 --> 01:29:33.390]  But we cannot paint all Muslims with a very broad brush.
[01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:38.033]  The vast majority is that... The facts remain that the vast majority of Muslims
[01:29:38.953 --> 01:29:42.535]  Are peaceful people, people of faith, and a lot of them are coming here.
[01:29:42.615 --> 01:29:42.916]  Why?
[01:29:43.256 --> 01:29:47.618]  Because they don't want to be dealing with ISIS that don't want... Oh, I totally agree with you.
[01:29:47.638 --> 01:29:52.521]  I mean, I have lots of Muslim friends I went to college with, nice people, and they all didn't want to be in that.
[01:29:52.882 --> 01:29:53.682]  That's why they came here.
[01:29:53.702 --> 01:29:54.342]  Absolutely.
[01:29:54.482 --> 01:29:56.644]  We'll be back with Art Acevedo, Austin Police Chief.
[01:29:56.684 --> 01:29:57.424]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:58.545 --> 01:29:59.445]  We're on the march.
[01:29:59.946 --> 01:30:01.547]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.467 --> 01:30:05.149]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:13.654]  Sometimes when people are offended, they want to some... You can just come in and say, stop that!
[01:30:13.854 --> 01:30:15.975]  Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
[01:30:16.156 --> 01:30:20.659]  If you start saying, we mustn't criticize or offend them, then humor's gone.
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:22.941]  With humor goes a sense of proportion.
[01:30:23.321 --> 01:30:25.523]  And then as far as I'm concerned, you're living in 1984.
[01:30:26.704 --> 01:30:28.927]  That was John Cleese of Monty Python.
[01:30:29.207 --> 01:30:32.611]  Political correctness is not a case of people who are well-meaning but neurotic.
[01:30:32.831 --> 01:30:36.695]  Not even spoiled and tolerant brats screaming at you with their hands over their ears.
[01:30:36.976 --> 01:30:39.318]  It's a weaponized tool of social control.
[01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:41.581]  You're accused of heresy on three counts.
[01:30:41.881 --> 01:30:44.564]  Heresy by thought, heresy by word, heresy by deeds, and heresy by action.
[01:30:44.604 --> 01:30:45.385]  Four counts.
[01:30:46.306 --> 01:30:50.407]  We should recognize the source where these weapons of social control are forged.
[01:30:50.807 --> 01:30:51.688]  The universities.
[01:30:52.108 --> 01:30:57.209]  Colleges are increasingly irrelevant to education, but essential to indoctrination.
[01:30:57.470 --> 01:31:05.532]  This is why Bernie and Hillary are so eager to extend kindergarten social control for free until people reach their mid-twenties or beyond.
[01:31:05.552 --> 01:31:08.133]  For Prison Planet TV, I'm David Knight.

[01:32:13.394 --> 01:32:18.020]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.181]  Talk about the effects.

[01:32:22.946 --> 01:32:24.007]  I feel like I look better.
[01:32:24.067 --> 01:32:24.708]  I feel better.
[01:32:24.768 --> 01:32:25.849]  I feel sexier.
[01:32:26.169 --> 01:32:26.550]  I love it.

[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:32.507]  Alright, I've got to ask some tough questions of Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo before he leaves us here in about 25 minutes.
[01:33:32.527 --> 01:33:33.488]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:33:33.868 --> 01:33:36.071]  Wait one second, but I've got to tell a story about you.
[01:33:36.672 --> 01:33:37.112]  I have to.
[01:33:37.132 --> 01:33:38.033]  Alright.
[01:33:38.554 --> 01:33:44.340]  I went to Norway to make a presentation, so I'm in the middle of a city in Norway, a big city.
[01:33:44.941 --> 01:33:45.201]  What's energy?
[01:34:04.608 --> 01:34:08.090]  Some subscription to some energy company, I don't know, electric company.
[01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:12.111]  And I said, I'm sorry, I'd love to help you, but I'm from Austin, Texas.
[01:34:12.771 --> 01:34:19.234]  And this kid from Nigeria, Norway, his eyes get this big, he goes, Austin, Texas?
[01:34:19.794 --> 01:34:21.835]  Do you know Alex Jones?
[01:34:23.315 --> 01:34:25.196]  I just started, Alex Jones?
[01:34:25.796 --> 01:34:28.157]  Yes, I said, I know Alex Jones, I'm on his show all the time.
[01:34:29.048 --> 01:34:30.269]  He is brilliant!
[01:34:30.630 --> 01:34:31.110]  Oh, Lord.
[01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:40.859]  And I said, only Alex Jones can be reaching out all the way to a Somali kid living in... Or a Nigerian kid.
[01:34:41.179 --> 01:34:42.260]  I'm excuse me, a Nigerian.
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.601]  No, no, I'm sorry, a Somali.
[01:34:43.641 --> 01:34:44.402]  Somali, wow.
[01:34:44.622 --> 01:34:45.303]  I said Nigerian.
[01:34:45.323 --> 01:34:49.247]  So I actually did an interview and I videotaped it of him.
[01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:51.411]  And then you said you tried to get it to me.
[01:34:51.431 --> 01:34:52.331]  I tried to get it to you.
[01:34:52.351 --> 01:34:53.112]  You must have my whole number.
[01:34:53.152 --> 01:34:54.993]  Well, I want to see this interview.
[01:34:55.073 --> 01:34:55.713]  I've got to find it.
[01:34:55.773 --> 01:34:57.734]  I've got to go, hey folks, I'm here.
[01:34:57.754 --> 01:34:58.595]  What's your name?
[01:34:58.955 --> 01:35:01.736]  And then you also have your Alex Jones imitation, which is good.
[01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:02.597]  Oh, that's Alex Jones?
[01:35:02.737 --> 01:35:03.657]  He's crazy!
[01:35:04.158 --> 01:35:04.718]  Let me ask you this.
[01:35:05.098 --> 01:35:06.379]  Who do you really like for president?
[01:35:07.219 --> 01:35:07.780]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:35:08.919 --> 01:35:11.202]  By the way, you teased me earlier today.
[01:35:11.262 --> 01:35:14.225]  You said, you teased me earlier today.
[01:35:14.245 --> 01:35:17.829]  You said, Alex, I really can't be friends much longer or whatever because, you know, they're about to arrest you.
[01:35:18.370 --> 01:35:19.331]  And then I said, are you serious?
[01:35:19.351 --> 01:35:20.272]  You said, no, I'm joking.
[01:35:20.312 --> 01:35:24.077]  But I said, the reason I get a little concerned is you were here about a year and a half ago.
[01:35:25.393 --> 01:35:30.016]  And I want to get into the story, because I was asked not to get into it by the police out in California, because they thought he might be with other groups.
[01:35:30.276 --> 01:35:35.240]  And you said, hey, you know, there's been some crazy guy, you know, here in town, a couple of them that we've stopped.
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.761]  And then I said, no, I haven't heard of this.
[01:35:37.801 --> 01:35:39.342]  He said, well, you're going to hear about it very, very soon.
[01:35:39.402 --> 01:35:42.304]  And about a week later, I got contacted by the detectives out in California.
[01:35:42.324 --> 01:35:44.746]  I don't know how much you knew about at the time, but I thought you were joking that day.
[01:35:45.186 --> 01:35:53.033]  And then it was true, and then it really made me appreciate the Austin Police Department actually being aware of what was going on just off the guy's social media.
[01:35:53.373 --> 01:36:02.881]  So it kind of makes it a paradox, because I'm against NSA spying, and I'm against going into people's private stuff and spying on them, obviously, and so are you.
[01:36:03.201 --> 01:36:11.868]  But then I have this article about the Austin Police Department goes and friends people on Facebook so that they can, with keywords, track calls for violence and things like that.
[01:36:12.668 --> 01:36:14.650]  So how do you balance that?
[01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:20.734]  Obviously, if something's public, because when I talked about this last time, people said, that said, he's endorsed the NSA spying illegally.
[01:36:21.014 --> 01:36:21.935]  He's a total sellout.
[01:36:22.075 --> 01:36:22.335]  No.
[01:36:23.136 --> 01:36:30.161]  The Austin Police Department is monitoring people on social media saying they're going to come kill me and then alerting authorities and other jurisdictions when it's happening.
[01:36:30.641 --> 01:36:33.023]  How do you say now, oh, this is a horrible idea?
[01:36:33.783 --> 01:36:34.823]  So there's the paradox.
[01:36:35.103 --> 01:36:36.524]  I mean, everything's a balance.
[01:36:36.684 --> 01:36:44.807]  And I think that people, you know, what we look for as a police department is I don't care who you want to vote for.
[01:36:44.827 --> 01:36:48.208]  I don't care if you even want to say, hey, we need to overthrow the government.
[01:36:48.508 --> 01:36:51.849]  To me, overthrowing the government, there's a way to do it legally.
[01:36:52.409 --> 01:36:53.490]  And there's a way to do it illegally.
[01:36:53.510 --> 01:37:00.114]  And legally means you organize and you vote and you get rid of the party or whoever you want to get rid of.
[01:37:00.575 --> 01:37:11.062]  But when people start talking about hurting people or hurting themselves or killing or doing anything that would do harm to others, I believe that that's what we're looking for.
[01:37:11.082 --> 01:37:13.744]  And I know that's what we're looking for and that's what we should be looking for.
[01:37:14.444 --> 01:37:16.485]  And I don't think that's a bad thing.
[01:37:16.505 --> 01:37:25.567]  That's not something I'm going to apologize for because, you know, your views sometimes can be extreme in the minds of others, maybe not extreme enough for others.
[01:37:26.068 --> 01:37:34.630]  And if somebody wants to hurt you or your family or one of your listeners or viewers, we should be looking for those type of threats.
[01:37:35.370 --> 01:37:37.231]  And so I'm not going to apologize for that now.
[01:37:37.851 --> 01:37:45.835]  If we're going to go try to get into somebody's personal account, then I believe that you must have probable cause and you must use a search warrant.
[01:37:46.196 --> 01:37:51.419]  But people know that there is no privacy out there when you tweet stuff and things of that nature.
[01:37:51.459 --> 01:37:57.362]  And so if there's no expectation of privacy, what would happen is if we didn't find it,
[01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:07.610]  If we didn't look for it, and then something seriously happened, we would be crucified for saying it was right out there in the open, and the police department didn't even bother doing anything about it.
[01:38:07.630 --> 01:38:12.432]  Well, I've noticed the police department and the feds don't respond to stuff like, you know, I'd love to kill Alex.
[01:38:12.452 --> 01:38:16.134]  Well, they can tell that's some guy that says that all the time about a bunch of people, it's not real.
[01:38:16.354 --> 01:38:22.397]  But when somebody's all on there planning it all out, and how they were there, and how they're getting ready to do it, I mean, you can tell that has to be responded to.
[01:38:22.924 --> 01:38:32.326]  Absolutely, and I think that we have a moral obligation to be on the lookout for credible threats and to investigate credible threats.
[01:38:32.386 --> 01:38:47.230]  Well, in the case of San Bernardino, two years before the FBI was specifically investigating that mosque and those two individuals, and then they were ordered to stand down, but the Justice Department, saying it was politically incorrect, they even investigated those officers, those agents with the task force.
[01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:52.733]  And then notice what happened, and then that got swept under the rug, but that was even in the California newspapers.
[01:38:53.094 --> 01:39:04.261]  So there you go, where people's hands are being tied because of political correctness, and that leads me to some of the articles dealing with traffic deaths here in Austin, the Austin American Statesman.
[01:39:04.562 --> 01:39:07.223]  I'm not against people from Mexico or Latin America or China.
[01:39:08.044 --> 01:39:16.733]  But a lot of them have never driven, or in those countries, I mean I've been in Mexico, people drive like maniacs in big cities, you ignore all those traffic signs, it's not a cliche, it's a fact.
[01:39:17.113 --> 01:39:27.865]  Same thing in China, they get here, they drive like maniacs, and I've talked to the prosecutors who've come here off record, and they say the judges give them $10 fines or nothing, including for DWIs.
[01:39:27.925 --> 01:39:29.827]  Now I know you're going to deny all this because you have to, but
[01:39:31.348 --> 01:39:33.889]  You won't hear me deny we're too lenient on people.
[01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.509]  Really?
[01:39:34.949 --> 01:39:36.790]  No, I think we're too lenient.
[01:39:37.150 --> 01:39:41.192]  Listen, Alex, we've had people drunk driving kill two people.
[01:39:42.753 --> 01:39:43.273]  Two people.
[01:39:43.433 --> 01:39:44.374]  And we give them probation.
[01:39:44.394 --> 01:39:50.857]  Here's part of the problem is that you can be sentenced by a jury.
[01:39:51.337 --> 01:39:53.038]  You are so good changing the subject.
[01:39:53.078 --> 01:39:54.939]  The illegals are the lion's share of it.
[01:39:55.119 --> 01:39:55.980]  They're getting away with everything.
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:56.500]  Why is that?
[01:39:56.994 --> 01:39:58.016]  No, it's not the illegals.
[01:39:58.036 --> 01:40:01.102]  I mean, we are looking at data right now just so you all know.
[01:40:01.122 --> 01:40:04.668]  Okay, well I've been backhanded like three times in the last 20 years in Austin.
[01:40:04.688 --> 01:40:06.311]  It's always an illegal, it doesn't speak to you.
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:09.401]  Well, just because it doesn't speak English doesn't mean they're illegal.
[01:40:09.481 --> 01:40:11.202]  Oh, come on!
[01:40:11.242 --> 01:40:12.402]  You're making an assumption there.
[01:40:12.422 --> 01:40:14.363]  What have they got in Mexican plates like happened once?
[01:40:14.603 --> 01:40:16.624]  Well, then they're probably visiting here.
[01:40:16.664 --> 01:40:17.025]  I don't know.
[01:40:17.105 --> 01:40:29.090]  But here's what we're looking at right now, just so you know, because we're looking at data right now on fatalities and hit-and-runs and where we can determine how many are unlicensed and suspended drivers.
[01:40:29.530 --> 01:40:33.472]  And we may be looking to ask the council for authority to impound vehicles
[01:40:34.212 --> 01:40:37.073]  Uh, of people that are, uh, driving with a suspended license.
[01:40:37.533 --> 01:40:37.833]  Ooh!
[01:40:37.953 --> 01:40:39.073]  And so... That's good!
[01:40:39.213 --> 01:40:43.574]  Well, we're looking at the data to see if we can build... Because why should I have to... Here's an example.
[01:40:43.594 --> 01:40:46.275]  They're letting flights come in to JFK from outside the U.S.
[01:40:46.295 --> 01:40:48.675]  and not even checking, uh, any of their IDs.
[01:40:49.175 --> 01:40:55.857]  They're, they're, they're, quote, completing the smuggling process in McAllen where the Border Patrol's ordered to load people on buses and ship them out of the country.
[01:40:56.057 --> 01:40:58.977]  But then I'm supposed to show all my ID and go through all these hoops.
[01:40:59.497 --> 01:41:01.898]  Now, if you deny those stories or say you don't know about them, I'll put them on screen.
[01:41:02.378 --> 01:41:06.942]  Look at that, 150 on flight from Mexico allowed to skip customs, leave JFK Airport.
[01:41:06.962 --> 01:41:08.183]  They keep doing it over and over again.
[01:41:09.043 --> 01:41:10.324]  I can play the clip of the emergency.
[01:41:10.364 --> 01:41:14.407]  No, I mean, look, my job is to keep the city of Austin safe.
[01:41:15.088 --> 01:41:17.530]  We're the second safest city, and that's what I'm going to focus on.
[01:41:17.570 --> 01:41:21.173]  And if that's going on, I'd have a problem with that.
[01:41:21.253 --> 01:41:29.279]  So you tell your officers whether somebody is a drunk driver from Germany, China, South Africa, or Mexico, or Austin, Texas, arrest them.
[01:41:29.875 --> 01:41:31.415]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:41:31.455 --> 01:41:35.697]  And some people think we're a sanctuary city, and we're not.
[01:41:35.897 --> 01:41:55.982]  I mean, we don't focus, if you're a day laborer at the Home Depot and guys are there that may be undocumented immigrants, illegal immigrants, whatever term you want to use, it's not, I don't have the resources to go do ICE's job and go try to get those guys, but for their immigration status, they're not bothering anybody.
[01:41:56.802 --> 01:42:07.445]  But if you're out there committing crimes and stealing and robbing and drunk driving, we don't care whether you're legal or illegal, we're going to come after you.
[01:42:07.765 --> 01:42:25.929]  And if the federal government ICE comes to this city and tells me, hey, we've identified 15 MS-13 or some other drug trafficking organization or terrorist organization and they're illegal immigrants and we need your help, we're going to cooperate fully and go after those people because we are not a sanctuary city.
[01:42:26.169 --> 01:42:32.214]  There is no sanctuary for those that want to do harm to people that live, work, and visit Austin, Texas.
[01:42:33.095 --> 01:42:35.496]  Well, Austin is rated as one of the safest cities in the country.
[01:42:35.537 --> 01:42:36.257]  That's not hype.
[01:42:36.657 --> 01:42:38.319]  And you talk about, well, we're progressive.
[01:42:38.359 --> 01:42:45.865]  I think it's the mix of Texas politics and art and culture, and also the fact there's a lot of money here, so people, a lot of them have good jobs, compared to the rest of the country.
[01:42:46.285 --> 01:42:48.447]  I don't think we're economically as bad off as many areas.
[01:42:48.467 --> 01:42:49.588]  I think that's one of the big reasons.
[01:42:49.628 --> 01:42:53.211]  But also, we have a model police department overall, from my research.
[01:42:53.971 --> 01:42:58.354]  But at the same time, look at other progressive cities like Chicago and New York.
[01:42:58.374 --> 01:43:01.776]  And I know there's some good cops in those cities, but there's also some really bad ones.
[01:43:01.796 --> 01:43:03.998]  I mean, I've been up there.
[01:43:04.338 --> 01:43:06.159]  I've seen them treat tourists in D.C.
[01:43:06.359 --> 01:43:07.000]  and New York.
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:09.662]  It's nice families, like total crap.
[01:43:10.082 --> 01:43:13.024]  I have talked to awesome police that have been treated bad in New York by police.
[01:43:13.464 --> 01:43:18.428]  I've been in New York with cops with their bellies hanging out, smoking cigars with their hats on sideways.
[01:43:18.848 --> 01:43:19.969]  And I have video of this.
[01:43:20.589 --> 01:43:22.711]  And I just look at that, and that is shameful.
[01:43:23.191 --> 01:43:25.052]  And I don't know, is that the unions up there?
[01:43:25.193 --> 01:43:26.834]  Or what creates that?
[01:43:26.914 --> 01:43:28.595]  Or maybe you disagree with that stereotype.
[01:43:28.975 --> 01:43:34.239]  Well, listen, New York PD has got over, I think, 38,000, 40,000 police officers.
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:39.643]  You're going to end up having some rude people, just like I'm sure I've got rude people.
[01:43:39.663 --> 01:43:42.305]  I know I have rude people because I have to deal with them.
[01:43:42.726 --> 01:43:49.691]  But you also will look at NYPD, trying to keep 7 million, 8 million, whatever that population is.
[01:43:50.311 --> 01:44:01.062]  That is an absolute target from violence extremists, Muslim extremist groups, and they do a pretty phenomenal job under some really challenging circumstances.
[01:44:01.102 --> 01:44:03.284]  So are there some rude people there?
[01:44:03.324 --> 01:44:06.748]  Yeah, but there's rude reporters, there's good and bad in everything.
[01:44:07.008 --> 01:44:13.855]  But on balance, I think when you look at their department, 38,000 strong, whatever it is now, they're pretty decent.
[01:44:14.375 --> 01:44:15.236]  Well, here's what I know.
[01:44:15.256 --> 01:44:16.899]  No, I'm not here to defend NYPD.
[01:44:16.939 --> 01:44:17.540]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:17.980]  I hear you.
[01:44:18.761 --> 01:44:21.786]  But expanding on that, we know the police are bad in North Korea.
[01:44:23.468 --> 01:44:24.930]  Well, the state is bad in North Korea.
[01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:25.070]  Yes.
[01:44:25.110 --> 01:44:27.334]  That's why when you call me communist, I get really upset.
[01:44:28.772 --> 01:44:33.397]  Well, I mean, I know your dad helped fight the communists, didn't he?
[01:44:33.537 --> 01:44:37.300]  My father smuggled men up and down the country.
[01:44:38.041 --> 01:44:48.471]  We hid men in our house, anti-communist fighters, and so when these people call me communists, first of all, they have no clue what a communist is.
[01:44:48.491 --> 01:44:50.113]  They have no clue what they're talking about.
[01:44:50.233 --> 01:45:02.361]  When I said you're acting like a communist, supporting some of that gun control, and then saying that the Mayor Pro Tem didn't say after we register we're going to do that, that's when I was... I don't literally think you're a communist.
[01:45:03.342 --> 01:45:04.963]  I'm not advocating gun control.
[01:45:04.983 --> 01:45:10.347]  I'm advocating people control, controlling what people... No, no, I know, but when I say...
[01:45:11.167 --> 01:45:14.629]  If Artie Cerveda wants to support this gun control, he ought to go back to Cuba and be a communist.
[01:45:14.669 --> 01:45:15.490]  That's what I was saying.
[01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.710]  Okay.
[01:45:16.210 --> 01:45:17.071]  Pull that tape, please.
[01:45:17.111 --> 01:45:19.032]  I'm not sure that's exactly how you said it.
[01:45:19.052 --> 01:45:20.213]  I don't remember exactly what I said.
[01:45:20.233 --> 01:45:20.934]  Well, what did I say?
[01:45:21.294 --> 01:45:21.674]  Oh, yeah.
[01:45:21.734 --> 01:45:22.495]  He's a communist.
[01:45:22.515 --> 01:45:23.155]  That communist.
[01:45:23.195 --> 01:45:24.296]  But, you know, it's okay.
[01:45:24.316 --> 01:45:26.957]  It's all, you know, it's... Well, I already said I was sorry for that.
[01:45:27.218 --> 01:45:27.798]  You did.
[01:45:27.838 --> 01:45:28.458]  We still love you.
[01:45:28.939 --> 01:45:32.301]  Anyways, the point... Now you get beat up for being too nice to me by your viewers.
[01:45:32.341 --> 01:45:33.502]  No, I don't get beat up for that.
[01:45:33.562 --> 01:45:33.862]  No, no.
[01:45:34.262 --> 01:45:35.103]  Here's what's happened with me.
[01:45:36.274 --> 01:45:39.097]  And if you want me, I can give you a whole file on it, but I know you actually know all this.
[01:45:39.797 --> 01:45:40.598]  Okay, you know this.
[01:45:40.658 --> 01:45:41.719]  I've talked to a lot of police.
[01:45:41.759 --> 01:45:42.300]  They all know it.
[01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:46.124]  I have found that the police are the second most awake group in this country.
[01:45:46.504 --> 01:45:50.768]  The military, combat vets, people that have actually been in, special forces people.
[01:45:51.489 --> 01:45:59.617]  Let's just say 99% of the special forces people I've gotten to know, like, you know, Tim Kennedy, you name it, are totally awake.
[01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:03.690]  General enlisted and others, you know, 60, 70, 80 percent awake.
[01:46:04.471 --> 01:46:06.951]  Mid-level officers into high level are awake.
[01:46:07.532 --> 01:46:09.833]  And then the next awake group is police on average.
[01:46:10.293 --> 01:46:19.837]  So why should a patriot or somebody that's into restoring the republic get fixed into this whole thing that our problem is the police instead of reforming the overall system?
[01:46:20.017 --> 01:46:28.460]  And then I see Soros, not just here, but in Ukraine, in Syria, and all over running anti-police programs that they then use to overthrow the government.
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:30.082]  That's what they did in Ukraine.
[01:46:30.262 --> 01:46:31.183]  He brags he did that.
[01:46:31.823 --> 01:46:42.114]  So I'm telling you, they're running a real leftist movement to build the beginnings of violent revolution in this country with the sacrificial lamb of the police.
[01:46:42.455 --> 01:46:44.657]  And so I'm here warning the police about that.
[01:46:44.958 --> 01:46:46.519]  And the police tell me, look, we already know that.
[01:46:46.539 --> 01:46:47.620]  We've known that for 30, 40 years.
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:49.262]  But yes, we see that happening.
[01:46:50.143 --> 01:46:54.727]  To me, it's a natural ally with the police and especially the military.
[01:46:55.007 --> 01:47:00.232]  If they're so awake, why should we, the patriots, be tricked into an adversarial position?
[01:47:01.849 --> 01:47:03.991]  Well, you said a lot right there.
[01:47:04.011 --> 01:47:06.792]  But the bottom line is that the police is the people.
[01:47:06.832 --> 01:47:07.633]  We are the people.
[01:47:08.273 --> 01:47:10.535]  We are members of the community.
[01:47:10.795 --> 01:47:12.476]  We come from the community.
[01:47:12.516 --> 01:47:14.338]  We don't bring them from another planet.
[01:47:15.478 --> 01:47:18.801]  We're the children of your neighbors.
[01:47:18.841 --> 01:47:19.581]  We're your neighbors.
[01:47:19.901 --> 01:47:22.503]  And we will always stand for what's right.
[01:47:23.304 --> 01:47:27.507]  And on balance, I think that American policing is still the best in the free world.
[01:47:28.203 --> 01:47:33.147]  Well, I've got the article here where it does have you saying that you should impound the vehicles of those without licenses.
[01:47:34.188 --> 01:47:37.191]  And so, are you guys just going to use the license plate reading cameras?
[01:47:37.871 --> 01:47:40.153]  How many license plate reading cameras are you guys hooked into?
[01:47:40.993 --> 01:47:44.336]  We really, we're just starting to get some now.
[01:47:44.396 --> 01:47:48.359]  We're having some problems with the technology in the first generation.
[01:47:48.379 --> 01:47:51.301]  You know, LPRs, a lot of people don't like them.
[01:47:51.801 --> 01:47:52.282]  I don't like them.
[01:47:52.762 --> 01:47:59.788]  But, you know, it's a great investigative tool that if you get kidnapped by one of the crazies that might want to try and kidnap to try to recover you.
[01:48:00.068 --> 01:48:06.132]  You know, it's... Well, see, I'd be glad for it to be turned on for specific people you're hunting for, but that's constitutional.
[01:48:06.152 --> 01:48:07.614]  But what about when they grab all of it
[01:48:08.254 --> 01:48:10.295]  But Alex, here's the problem.
[01:48:11.555 --> 01:48:13.056]  Grabbing the data isn't the problem.
[01:48:13.136 --> 01:48:14.417]  It's how you use the data.
[01:48:14.837 --> 01:48:20.459]  And so, let's say we had an LPR on 35, hypothetically, which we don't have, by the way, so don't freak out.
[01:48:20.999 --> 01:48:25.461]  But we don't go in there unless we have a specific reason.
[01:48:25.501 --> 01:48:36.906]  And we find out that we're looking for a white car that killed somebody or robbed a bank and we can use that LPR information for legitimate police purposes
[01:48:37.486 --> 01:48:41.190]  Because you don't have a expectation of privacy when you're driving down the street.
[01:48:41.210 --> 01:48:42.091]  You just, you don't.
[01:48:42.171 --> 01:48:43.212]  Or walking down the street.
[01:48:43.493 --> 01:48:49.759]  I think, to me, we don't, it's not technology that we need to fear.
[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:53.183]  It's misuse of technology.
[01:48:53.303 --> 01:48:54.084]  And so we have to
[01:48:54.144 --> 01:48:54.984]  Here's what I'm getting at.
[01:48:55.124 --> 01:49:00.647]  If you know a certain car with a certain plate has committed a crime, then you turn the... I know they have these filters.
[01:49:00.667 --> 01:49:10.492]  You turn it on just to look for that plate or a group of plates, and then it's disregarding, just like they've done in California for a decade, police plates and other plates of government because you don't want them in the databases.
[01:49:11.152 --> 01:49:15.598]  You have to program it that way, then it could be used for kidnap kids or bank robbers or things.
[01:49:15.639 --> 01:49:23.930]  But just gathering it all, I mean, I've seen the documentaries where they're just driving around through a parking lot and this person's got a warrant, this person's, you know, doesn't have a license.
[01:49:24.351 --> 01:49:27.055]  And then, you know full well, like the illegal standing in front of a Home Depot.
[01:49:27.435 --> 01:49:30.337]  You guys are going to go through and the illegals aren't going to have the proper plates.
[01:49:30.817 --> 01:49:43.063]  They're going to be left alone, but then the fat, plump citizen, whether they be Hispanic, white, or black, they're going to get pulled over because they don't have insurance and the license plate reader shows that they haven't followed that so they're going to get the ticket.
[01:49:43.483 --> 01:49:46.705]  Yeah, but that's not what we would ever use LPRs for.
[01:49:46.825 --> 01:49:51.987]  LPR for me is a tool that we would use to investigate serious crime.
[01:49:52.007 --> 01:49:56.830]  By the way, you do have LPRs all over the place because you hook into the federal LPRs through the Threat Fusion Center.
[01:49:58.789 --> 01:49:59.870]  You gotta love Alex Jones.
[01:49:59.910 --> 01:50:00.931]  Nothing gets past him, huh?
[01:50:01.171 --> 01:50:02.952]  Oh, how'd I do that 20 years ago?
[01:50:02.972 --> 01:50:06.455]  What about the microphones you guys got up all over town?
[01:50:06.495 --> 01:50:09.217]  The gunshot detectors that are really microphones?
[01:50:09.237 --> 01:50:12.880]  We need to know when you're leaving town because we haven't changed the battery in yours in a while.
[01:50:14.401 --> 01:50:16.143]  All you gotta do is dial into my home security system.
[01:50:16.163 --> 01:50:18.345]  It's already got it all set up for you.
[01:50:18.385 --> 01:50:19.846]  I don't have cameras inside my house.
[01:50:19.866 --> 01:50:22.068]  They're all over the outside of the house, but not inside the house.
[01:50:22.088 --> 01:50:23.369]  I was about to say, don't stick them inside.
[01:50:23.389 --> 01:50:24.490]  I don't stick them inside.
[01:50:25.591 --> 01:50:27.692]  So we share some of the same concerns.
[01:50:27.753 --> 01:50:30.415]  I just, I don't want cameras inside my house.
[01:50:30.475 --> 01:50:31.236]  I put them outside my house.
[01:50:31.256 --> 01:50:33.898]  Well, they admit that hackers forever have the whole databases of those.
[01:50:34.218 --> 01:50:37.402]  Yeah, so, and so, that's the point.
[01:50:37.623 --> 01:50:40.927]  People can hack into your system and try to get inside your house.
[01:50:40.947 --> 01:50:52.042]  Well, that's another reason I don't think that they should have GPS on all the police cars and make them have cameras on at all times, because then it just, it sets the precedent where everybody has to do that and we're all being monitored by Big Brother.
[01:50:52.222 --> 01:50:57.868]  Yeah, well, we want the automatic vehicle locators because it's an officer's safety component for us.
[01:50:58.569 --> 01:51:00.250]  Just like we're actually going to get them on these radios.
[01:51:00.371 --> 01:51:01.552]  Always for the safety.
[01:51:01.612 --> 01:51:02.032]  Right here.
[01:51:02.112 --> 01:51:06.697]  Well, when my officer goes in foot pursuit and we can't find him... No, no, I know it's all got good uses.
[01:51:07.278 --> 01:51:08.759]  But everything good can be misused.
[01:51:08.779 --> 01:51:09.340]  That's why we have to be...
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:12.001]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:51:12.301 --> 01:51:14.922]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:51:14.942 --> 01:51:15.363]  Croix River.
[01:51:15.683 --> 01:51:17.684]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:51:17.904 --> 01:51:20.625]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:51:20.865 --> 01:51:21.385]  His excuse?
[01:51:21.745 --> 01:51:22.826]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:51:23.086 --> 01:51:24.367]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:51:24.687 --> 01:51:30.189]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[01:52:32.329 --> 01:52:42.136]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[01:52:42.356 --> 01:52:48.620]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:52.182]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[01:52:52.223 --> 01:52:54.044]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[01:52:54.264 --> 01:52:57.346]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[01:52:57.406 --> 01:52:58.007]  We're good to go.

[01:54:23.692 --> 01:54:24.953]  Look, it's really simple, folks.
[01:54:25.033 --> 01:54:31.136]  George Soros wants us to get in a war with the police so they can then have a big enough crisis to go after the guns.
[01:54:31.536 --> 01:54:32.676]  They want to start a civil war.
[01:54:32.756 --> 01:54:38.119]  That's why I was against the known operatives that were out there at the Oregon situation trying to stir that up.
[01:54:38.659 --> 01:54:40.360]  I told folks exactly how that would end.
[01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:41.180]  This is idiocy.
[01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:44.062]  We're winning politically with libertarian ideas.
[01:54:44.662 --> 01:54:51.971]  We're Republicans who aren't perfect but represented more than Democrats are winning almost all the governorships, almost all the new congressional seats.
[01:54:53.052 --> 01:54:54.814]  It's a total sweep happening right now.
[01:54:54.834 --> 01:54:59.140]  That's why MSNBC is preaching race war in the name of fighting racism.
[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:01.162]  Political correctness has gotten so bad.
[01:55:02.003 --> 01:55:07.964]  They are now in Oregon State trying to pull down quotes of Martin Luther King, saying he was a racist.
[01:55:08.184 --> 01:55:08.804]  I'm not kidding.
[01:55:09.125 --> 01:55:11.625]  And in Seattle, don't have brown paper bags, it's racist.
[01:55:11.665 --> 01:55:14.006]  So they want to create just this hysteria.
[01:55:14.266 --> 01:55:18.207]  We're all fighting with each other because black unemployment has doubled under Obama.
[01:55:18.507 --> 01:55:19.707]  He has to change the subject.
[01:55:20.267 --> 01:55:24.628]  Now, obviously, if a Donald Trump gets in or a Ted Cruz, we're going to hold their feet to the fire.
[01:55:25.267 --> 01:55:27.050]  But I've never seen such balkanization.
[01:55:27.070 --> 01:55:29.994]  Let me ask you that question, Austin Police Chief Arte Cerveda.
[01:55:30.235 --> 01:55:33.580]  You're with us this whole short segment and one more, and I appreciate you coming in on your busy schedule.
[01:55:34.882 --> 01:55:37.807]  Who are you as a private citizen liking in the campaign?
[01:55:38.047 --> 01:55:38.909]  What do you think of Donald Trump?
[01:55:40.213 --> 01:55:40.913]  It was entertaining.
[01:55:40.933 --> 01:55:42.573]  I just hope he doesn't deport me.
[01:55:42.593 --> 01:55:44.794]  I'm just telling him, don't deport me, bro, because I'm an immigrant.
[01:55:45.834 --> 01:55:46.454]  You're a U.S.
[01:55:46.494 --> 01:55:46.814]  citizen.
[01:55:47.114 --> 01:55:47.614]  Yes, I am.
[01:55:47.654 --> 01:55:48.074]  Yes, I am.
[01:55:48.154 --> 01:56:01.397]  And but, you know, listen, I just anybody that throws their hat in the ring for something, regardless whether they're Democrat or Republican or Libertarian or Green Party, whoever, they're at least participating.
[01:56:01.457 --> 01:56:06.098]  And I would just tell your listeners that the number one thing that you can do
[01:56:07.701 --> 01:56:14.640]  To protect liberty and to impact the political process in this country is VOTE!
[01:56:15.666 --> 01:56:16.006]  Vote!
[01:56:16.066 --> 01:56:17.127]  Your vote matters.
[01:56:17.527 --> 01:56:18.407]  Please vote.
[01:56:18.487 --> 01:56:19.868]  I don't care who you vote for.
[01:56:20.248 --> 01:56:21.568]  You can vote for whoever you want.
[01:56:21.588 --> 01:56:23.509]  What's it like to see Ted Cruz?
[01:56:23.529 --> 01:56:25.850]  His dad was an anti-communist guy, just like your dad.
[01:56:25.870 --> 01:56:28.491]  I know your dad was involved with the CIA and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:56:28.531 --> 01:56:31.532]  Cruz's dad has a similar type background fighting Castro.
[01:56:31.852 --> 01:56:33.533]  I mean, Rubio, it's fake.
[01:56:34.013 --> 01:56:35.553]  They were here way before his dad was a bartender.
[01:56:35.753 --> 01:56:39.535]  I'm not knocking that, but they don't have that anti-communist background, so I get why you get mad at that.
[01:56:40.055 --> 01:56:41.616]  I mean, Cruz really is a smart guy.
[01:56:41.636 --> 01:56:46.019]  Does it give you some pride to see, you know, a Cuban-American right there in the lead for president?
[01:56:46.099 --> 01:57:09.253]  I mean, it just gives me pride to see that only in this country, whether it's the son of a Kenyan, you know, and President Barack Obama, or the son of a Cuban immigrant and an American mother and Ted Cruz, I mean, it just gives me pride that we live in a nation where only in this country can the offspring of those men from other countries
[01:57:10.354 --> 01:57:13.537]  You know, Hispanic and African American, only in this country.
[01:57:14.157 --> 01:57:17.401]  Folks do forget that in other countries, it's very hard.
[01:57:17.441 --> 01:57:18.682]  Like, why did Italians come here?
[01:57:18.722 --> 01:57:19.783]  Because it was a caste system.
[01:57:20.163 --> 01:57:22.506]  If you came from a cobbler that made shoes, that's what you had to be.
[01:57:22.926 --> 01:57:24.308]  Or go down, you couldn't go up.
[01:57:24.928 --> 01:57:25.889]  I mean, this is a great country.
[01:57:25.909 --> 01:57:33.517]  I mean, with warts and all, you know, my old man used to say that, you know, that anti-communist old man used to say, kids from here to the moon, there's no better place on earth.
[01:57:34.249 --> 01:57:39.273]  Well, I mean, looking at that, communism produces a few people on top.
[01:57:39.313 --> 01:57:46.019]  I don't get how they sell it as a people's ideology, or Bernie Sanders, who really does promote communism, not socialism, which is bad enough.
[01:57:46.079 --> 01:57:50.143]  I mean, how are they selling socialism in America when it doesn't work?
[01:57:50.883 --> 01:57:51.864]  Well, I don't know if they're selling it.
[01:57:51.924 --> 01:57:54.847]  I can just tell you that my dad used to say,
[01:57:56.212 --> 01:58:04.921]  Communism is great as long as you're the government with eating steak every day while everybody else is getting a pound of rice for 30 days.
[01:58:05.862 --> 01:58:09.606]  So there's a good communist to me.
[01:58:11.101 --> 01:58:15.845]  You know the, you know the, you know the... Oh my gosh, that sounds like a right-wing extremist statement over here.
[01:58:15.925 --> 01:58:18.527]  I mean, hey, I have no use for communists.
[01:58:19.248 --> 01:58:19.668]  I just don't.
[01:58:19.688 --> 01:58:23.151]  Well, you're right, is that it's total slavery everywhere it's implemented, and then... No.
[01:58:23.211 --> 01:58:25.033]  No, no, it's a slavery to the state.

[02:00:01.090 --> 02:00:03.774]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:10.302 --> 02:00:15.368]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.729 --> 02:00:17.992]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:00:28.697 --> 02:00:28.798]  Yeah.
[02:00:42.982 --> 02:00:45.905]  Art Acevedo is here, Austin Police Chief.
[02:00:46.946 --> 02:00:53.372]  And Art, again, I told you that the blood taking, I didn't think that those warrants were fully done properly.
[02:00:53.873 --> 02:00:55.374]  Gotta be a little mean here at the end.
[02:00:55.795 --> 02:00:58.818]  You've defended it, but Texas court and others have said it's unconstitutional.
[02:00:59.462 --> 02:01:00.762]  Well, not the way we do it.
[02:01:00.962 --> 02:01:02.863]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:01:03.603 --> 02:01:06.463]  Believe me, if we did something unconstitutional, we'd already been sued and lost.
[02:01:06.863 --> 02:01:07.863]  So how do you do it?
[02:01:08.343 --> 02:01:09.384]  We get search warrants.
[02:01:09.484 --> 02:01:12.584]  We don't just do it on a willy-nilly.
[02:01:13.044 --> 02:01:15.285]  We develop probable cause and we get search warrants.
[02:01:15.365 --> 02:01:18.645]  But you have a judge kind of rubber-stamping it, right?
[02:01:18.665 --> 02:01:22.486]  Because the person's not in a court, the judge is on the phone.
[02:01:22.786 --> 02:01:25.806]  Most of the time, the magistrate's right there on duty.
[02:01:26.447 --> 02:01:27.687]  So we have a judge on duty.
[02:01:27.707 --> 02:01:28.887]  You have an RV and all that?
[02:01:30.047 --> 02:01:32.008]  We use a phlebotomist at the jail, yeah.
[02:01:32.088 --> 02:01:39.472]  And so, you know, listen, I know that people hate that, but, you know, we follow the law, and that's all I can tell you.
[02:01:39.532 --> 02:01:46.536]  And when you see so many people dying in my city, in our city, in a city that we love, and around the country, you know, don't drink and drive.
[02:01:46.556 --> 02:01:47.196]  It's very simple.
[02:01:47.316 --> 02:01:51.879]  It's a very, very simple way to avoid getting blood tests is don't get arrested for drunk driving.
[02:01:52.381 --> 02:01:53.061]  Other topics.
[02:01:53.262 --> 02:01:54.142]  We only have a few minutes left.
[02:01:54.182 --> 02:01:57.484]  Other points you haven't gotten into that are important for the viewers and listeners out there?
[02:01:58.084 --> 02:02:06.069]  I think that one of the things that's really important right now in this country is for people to not buy into the false narrative that policing is out of control.
[02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:07.450]  It's just not.
[02:02:08.650 --> 02:02:09.391]  Is it perfect?
[02:02:09.551 --> 02:02:09.791]  No.
[02:02:09.911 --> 02:02:11.512]  I've seen some really bad policing.
[02:02:11.892 --> 02:02:13.433]  I've dealt with bad policing here.
[02:02:13.893 --> 02:02:18.236]  We need to do as a profession a better job in some cities of holding officers accountable.
[02:02:18.836 --> 02:02:22.918]  But, by and large, American policing is better than it's ever been.
[02:02:23.578 --> 02:02:27.999]  Our officers are better trained, better educated, better equipped, and more professional than ever.
[02:02:28.139 --> 02:02:29.280]  And that is an absolute truth.
[02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:30.460]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:33.481]  I've seen over the years some Austin cops on power trips.
[02:02:33.681 --> 02:02:35.242]  I won't even get near 6th Street.
[02:02:35.262 --> 02:02:41.684]  There were some good restaurants back in the day down there because I guess they had the special units of cops, some of them that acted like, you know, goons, looked like crazy bouncers.
[02:02:42.064 --> 02:02:43.225]  I don't see as many of those.
[02:02:43.705 --> 02:02:47.026]  And most Austin police I run into are actually cheerful, helpful, and nice.
[02:02:47.706 --> 02:02:57.109]  And that's just refreshing, and so I hope that your brand of policing, because it's gotten better with you here, I disagree with a lot of stuff you do, but gotta be honest, overall it's gotten a lot better, so we appreciate that.
[02:02:57.389 --> 02:03:14.055]  Yeah, and I think, you know, and here's a bottom line folks, whether you agree with your police chief or whoever, we should never stop engaging each other, because I think that a lot of times by engaging each other we end up understanding each other, but more importantly people need to know you're watching and paying attention.
[02:03:14.275 --> 02:03:14.675]  Absolutely.
[02:03:14.715 --> 02:03:16.016]  Listen, you didn't know this was going to happen.
[02:03:16.136 --> 02:03:16.356]  No.
[02:03:16.436 --> 02:03:21.759]  I was talking to my dad a few months ago, and I said, I really just don't want to give money to churches this year.
[02:03:21.779 --> 02:03:24.320]  I want to start giving it, you know, to different groups.
[02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:26.761]  I always give money to Salvation Army, Meals on Wheels, things like that.
[02:03:26.781 --> 02:03:29.982]  I don't tell people how much money we give, because most of it goes back to the operation.
[02:03:30.022 --> 02:03:33.304]  That's where the real profits we make just go into expanding, reaching out.
[02:03:33.944 --> 02:03:37.606]  But with the Austin Police, you know, I've been looking out for many citizens, not just myself and others.
[02:03:37.846 --> 02:03:39.167]  They get shot, they get killed.
[02:03:39.887 --> 02:03:41.388]  You know, some of the left cheer about it.
[02:03:41.488 --> 02:03:42.729]  It makes me very upset.
[02:03:42.749 --> 02:03:51.175]  So I'm giving money to the fallen officer who was responding in part to a guy that you guys have reported on here in Texas and California.
[02:03:51.456 --> 02:03:52.336]  That officer was killed.
[02:03:52.356 --> 02:03:58.621]  I'm going to send money specifically to his family and also to the fallen officer fund in that county.
[02:03:58.841 --> 02:04:02.564]  But I wanted to give you this check for the Austin Police Department Charities Program.
[02:04:04.565 --> 02:04:07.327]  That's fantastic.
[02:04:07.788 --> 02:04:13.452]  Thank you very much and this is for the Austin Cops for Charities and that's going to be a lot to me.
[02:04:13.472 --> 02:04:22.218]  Well that's nothing for the police officers that get run over, you know, out there changing tires or get shot at or killed and I know that it's easy for the system to blame everything on you.
[02:04:22.378 --> 02:04:23.940]  You just said something, changing tires.
[02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:37.328]  My cops, I get letters all the time, help citizens change tires, change tires for citizens, and some officers somewhere might think that that's demeaning or belittling them, and it gives me a great deal of pride that our folks do that kind of stuff.
[02:04:37.348 --> 02:04:39.510]  I see it a lot, and that's what good cops do.
[02:04:39.550 --> 02:04:39.710]  Yep.
[02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:40.370]  We're here to serve.
[02:04:40.750 --> 02:04:44.633]  We're peacemakers, we're peacekeepers, we're guardians, and we're here to serve.
[02:04:45.053 --> 02:04:47.715]  Well, and that check is also in part to tell Jordan Soros go to hell.
[02:04:48.851 --> 02:04:49.732]  I don't know anything about that.
[02:04:49.812 --> 02:04:53.614]  He's a known Nazi collaborator, but a communist on top of it, and a billionaire is tax exempt.
[02:04:53.954 --> 02:04:54.294]  Okay.
[02:04:55.035 --> 02:04:55.775]  Art, thanks for coming in.
[02:04:55.815 --> 02:04:56.256]  Good to see you.
[02:04:56.296 --> 02:04:57.236]  Happy New Year.
[02:04:57.316 --> 02:04:58.857]  Okay, you can tell Soros you love him.
[02:04:59.558 --> 02:05:00.178]  No, I don't know him.
[02:05:01.479 --> 02:05:02.219]  You know nothing!
[02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:03.820]  I'm Sergeant Schultz.
[02:05:04.821 --> 02:05:06.002]  Alright, I'll walk you out.
[02:05:06.022 --> 02:05:06.562]  Thanks for coming in.
[02:05:06.582 --> 02:05:07.543]  We'll be back, folks.
[02:05:09.053 --> 02:05:11.354]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[02:05:11.494 --> 02:05:20.656]  Now I continue to see college kids all across the country going around protesting, saying that they demand $15 raise for minimum wage.
[02:05:20.976 --> 02:05:21.676]  And what did I say?
[02:05:22.017 --> 02:05:23.517]  Well, you're going to continue to do that.
[02:05:23.537 --> 02:05:24.837]  And guess what companies are going to do?
[02:05:25.037 --> 02:05:27.058]  They're going to fire you and hire a robot.
[02:05:27.098 --> 02:05:28.378]  Then they don't have to pay anybody.
[02:05:28.398 --> 02:05:32.459]  And that robot can quadruple their work, do it for 24 hours straight.
[02:05:32.519 --> 02:05:33.420]  They don't need a lunch break.
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:34.380]  They don't need anything like that.
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:36.062]  And well guess what, it's finally here.
[02:05:36.242 --> 02:05:41.968]  Article by Tech Insider, these four foot tall robots could change the way warehouse workers do their job.
[02:05:42.048 --> 02:05:46.873]  And it's not just going to be warehouse workers, it's going to be the people at Burger King, at McDonald's, all over the place.
[02:05:46.933 --> 02:05:51.237]  The Locus Robot can zip around a clothing warehouse larger than the size of six football fields.
[02:05:51.397 --> 02:05:55.842]  It can also work for 24 hours without a break for lunch or a salary.
[02:05:55.942 --> 02:05:57.744]  The new bot created by Locus Robotics
[02:05:57.824 --> 02:06:03.757]  It just launched in its first warehouse, a Devins, Massachusetts space owned by Quiet Logistics.
[02:06:04.098 --> 02:06:06.764]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:08.851 --> 02:06:09.711]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:06:09.811 --> 02:06:10.211]  Good, brother.
[02:06:10.371 --> 02:06:12.132]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:06:12.332 --> 02:06:13.973]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:06:14.033 --> 02:06:18.074]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:06:18.094 --> 02:06:18.794]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:06:18.814 --> 02:06:22.915]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:06:23.115 --> 02:06:31.078]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[02:06:31.278 --> 02:06:34.402]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[02:06:34.522 --> 02:06:36.024]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[02:06:36.064 --> 02:06:38.947]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:06:38.968 --> 02:06:40.469]  Saving a ton of money there.
[02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:43.253]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[02:06:43.493 --> 02:06:46.577]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated.
[02:06:46.817 --> 02:06:48.418]  For maximum potency.
[02:06:48.598 --> 02:07:00.547]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while but then burn you out in my experience where it's stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source so it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[02:07:00.607 --> 02:07:07.552]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[02:07:11.994 --> 02:07:21.360]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:24.322]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:07:24.422 --> 02:07:27.764]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:07:27.964 --> 02:07:34.008]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[02:07:34.308 --> 02:07:38.231]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[02:07:38.271 --> 02:07:38.771]  That's right.
[02:08:09.511 --> 02:08:11.392]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[02:08:11.452 --> 02:08:13.313]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:08:13.413 --> 02:08:16.133]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:08:16.334 --> 02:08:17.074]  Alex Jones.
[02:08:17.154 --> 02:08:18.174]  His name is Alex Jones.
[02:08:18.254 --> 02:08:21.135]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:08:21.355 --> 02:08:24.556]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.636 --> 02:08:26.577]  Alex Jones, the nut job radio guy.
[02:08:26.597 --> 02:08:28.137]  Talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:08:28.197 --> 02:08:33.499]  A man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories, you have to wonder if he really believes half of what he says.
[02:08:33.519 --> 02:08:34.619]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:08:34.639 --> 02:08:35.920]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:36.800]  This isn't a game!
[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:37.881]  Hate speech.
[02:08:38.101 --> 02:08:40.103]  Can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[02:08:40.123 --> 02:08:44.426]  I think Alex was the one who took the pro-gun position.
[02:08:48.602 --> 02:08:50.423]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[02:08:50.583 --> 02:08:52.144]  Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[02:08:52.325 --> 02:08:55.487]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
[02:08:55.627 --> 02:08:58.108]  It's an internet talk show called Info Wars.
[02:08:58.288 --> 02:09:00.350]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[02:09:00.370 --> 02:09:01.230]  Are you insane?
[02:09:01.490 --> 02:09:03.812]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[02:09:03.832 --> 02:09:06.494]  You're making some very serious allegations against the U.S.
[02:09:06.534 --> 02:09:11.157]  government, saying that they stage attacks, they allow them to occur in the United States against U.S.
[02:09:11.177 --> 02:09:11.457]  citizens.
[02:09:11.477 --> 02:09:12.217]  Must be classified!
[02:09:12.337 --> 02:09:13.858]  Alex Jones may sound crazy.
[02:09:14.099 --> 02:09:16.520]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[02:09:16.580 --> 02:09:17.721]  That man's a threat to this country.
[02:09:17.981 --> 02:09:19.342]  He is a conspiracy theorist.
[02:09:19.382 --> 02:09:20.683]  Deeply, I think, racist.
[02:09:20.763 --> 02:09:22.604]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[02:09:22.624 --> 02:09:24.245]  He's considered legit among the crazy.
[02:09:24.466 --> 02:09:30.450]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him.
[02:09:30.670 --> 02:09:31.370]  I'd love to see that.
[02:09:32.111 --> 02:09:32.791]  In uniform.
[02:09:34.152 --> 02:09:37.535]  Keep shoving lies at your audience, jackasses.
[02:09:38.795 --> 02:09:39.356]  I like that guy.
[02:09:55.752 --> 02:09:57.874]  We have gangsters running this country.
[02:09:58.254 --> 02:09:58.754]  Criminals!
[02:09:58.914 --> 02:09:59.415]  Gangsters!
[02:09:59.455 --> 02:10:02.377]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose.
[02:10:05.130 --> 02:10:08.233]  We have a fog that has descended upon our entire nation.
[02:10:08.293 --> 02:10:10.475]  The globalists are going to blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[02:10:10.495 --> 02:10:12.817]  Well, Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
[02:10:12.837 --> 02:10:17.762]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spades.
[02:10:18.502 --> 02:10:19.263]  It's as real as it gets.
[02:10:19.663 --> 02:10:23.126]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[02:10:23.346 --> 02:10:24.608]  To Matt, it's over for you.
[02:10:24.648 --> 02:10:26.810]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[02:10:27.110 --> 02:10:28.311]  You're out of there.
[02:10:28.331 --> 02:10:29.652]  You want it, baby?
[02:10:29.932 --> 02:10:31.514]  You're about to get it.
[02:10:38.180 --> 02:10:46.203]  We did meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant, and see how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[02:10:46.583 --> 02:10:51.165]  We met them at Concord Bridge, and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
[02:10:51.525 --> 02:11:03.529]  InfoWars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of freedom, and I'm so proud of that.
[02:11:03.709 --> 02:11:06.972]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women.
[02:11:07.012 --> 02:11:11.917]  No, Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[02:11:12.017 --> 02:11:21.887]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[02:11:22.107 --> 02:11:24.349]  These people are of the devil.
[02:11:24.369 --> 02:11:26.291]  Let's be very blunt about this.
[02:11:27.732 --> 02:11:29.954]  Tell and demand accountability.
[02:11:30.194 --> 02:11:36.939]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:42.963]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:11:43.724 --> 02:11:45.845]  The crowd is now moving forward toward the barrier.
[02:11:45.865 --> 02:11:50.629]  The police have been telling everybody they're going to shoot if we don't move back.
[02:11:50.749 --> 02:11:54.612]  Their defeat will be ultimately a crushing one.
[02:11:57.657 --> 02:12:01.018]  From the front lines of the information war, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:12:01.038 --> 02:12:05.239]  Dr. Edward Group, our good friend, is going to be with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:12:06.099 --> 02:12:10.240]  Just briefly on why I had Police Chief Arte Cerveda here in studio with us.
[02:12:11.561 --> 02:12:17.822]  Behind the scenes, I've talked to that guy, obviously, when he's saying the only good communist is a wink, you know, dead communist, is that guy knows what's going on.
[02:12:17.842 --> 02:12:22.824]  He knows how the cow ate the cabbage, and he plays along with the whole liberal, you know, charade thing.
[02:12:24.130 --> 02:12:25.570]  And that's what I found with most police.
[02:12:25.590 --> 02:12:26.951]  They're not just telling you what you want to hear.
[02:12:26.991 --> 02:12:30.151]  That's what really happens when the rubber meets the road, is they're constitutionalists.
[02:12:30.511 --> 02:12:31.552]  There are some bad ones.
[02:12:32.812 --> 02:12:38.253]  They want us to, though, make the whole fight about that because they're the most visual, visible symbol of the government.
[02:12:39.073 --> 02:12:47.295]  And we have robots replacing the troops, robots replacing us at the factories, by design to displace humanity in the globalist's own words.
[02:12:47.335 --> 02:12:51.236]  The driverless cars, all of it is to build an anti-human century.
[02:12:52.182 --> 02:12:57.985]  Not the American Century, like Marco Rubio says, which is a neocon statement, the New American Century.
[02:12:59.986 --> 02:13:00.906]  Ask, is he a neocon?
[02:13:00.926 --> 02:13:02.967]  That's the name of their seminal paper, the New American Century, 2000.
[02:13:05.458 --> 02:13:15.047]  And one, we have to come together as humanity and recognize that we're being manipulated by the technocrats using scientific social control.
[02:13:15.507 --> 02:13:22.094]  Now, when somebody does you wrong, or somebody runs over you, or somebody is doing things that are criminal, you oppose them and you stand up against them.
[02:13:22.878 --> 02:13:27.560]  But you don't do it just because they're black, or they're white, or they're a cop, or they're a woman.
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:32.402]  And you also don't just vote for somebody because they're black, or white, or a woman.
[02:13:32.822 --> 02:13:34.163]  You know, we have an interview coming up.
[02:13:34.483 --> 02:13:36.003]  It's a joke piece that Biggs did.
[02:13:36.784 --> 02:13:41.226]  It translates well on TV, somewhat well on radio, but it's really funny.
[02:13:41.726 --> 02:13:51.650]  A secret to Hillary coin toss discovered is the name of the video, it's up on Infowars.com, where he dressed up like Hillary Clinton as a stunt, and he comes across women
[02:13:52.982 --> 02:13:57.606]  Uh, who, just in a cliché way, you know, appear to be in the girl power.
[02:13:57.786 --> 02:13:58.307]  They say that.
[02:13:58.807 --> 02:14:03.051]  They say, we're going to vote for Hillary because she's a girl, period.
[02:14:04.152 --> 02:14:06.274]  And they're very, very honest about that.
[02:14:06.314 --> 02:14:09.276]  Just like people say they're going to vote for Obama because he's black, he's black, he's black.
[02:14:09.296 --> 02:14:10.077]  That's the famous quote.
[02:14:10.898 --> 02:14:11.819]  The lady goes, he's black!
[02:14:12.039 --> 02:14:12.499]  He's black!
[02:14:12.659 --> 02:14:13.160]  He's black!
[02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:15.382]  You know, I mean, I wouldn't vote for somebody because they were white.
[02:14:16.604 --> 02:14:19.288]  Unless they agreed with me and had a good record of that.
[02:14:19.308 --> 02:14:21.391]  I mean, I would vote for somebody who was black in a second.
[02:14:22.011 --> 02:14:24.114]  A woman, in a... I could literally...
[02:14:25.034 --> 02:14:29.836]  Heck, I would enjoy seeing a smart woman in the White House that was a patriot.
[02:14:29.876 --> 02:14:30.837]  I would relish that.
[02:14:31.317 --> 02:14:32.498]  Heck, I wouldn't just put up with it.
[02:14:33.318 --> 02:14:34.859]  Because I want to kill all these clichés.
[02:14:35.019 --> 02:14:39.921]  The problem is, a lot of times in history, you get women that are more diabolical, smarter, and more manipulable than men.
[02:14:40.182 --> 02:14:42.143]  There's this idea that women are going to come in and fix everything.
[02:14:42.363 --> 02:14:44.264]  The women are running all these wars right now.
[02:14:44.844 --> 02:14:46.865]  So again, I'm tired of men being scapegoated.
[02:14:48.103 --> 02:14:51.726]  I'm tired of any group of humans being scapegoated like we're separated from each other.
[02:14:52.026 --> 02:14:53.267]  And that's how we're being controlled.
[02:14:53.887 --> 02:14:54.848]  So that's the bottom line here.
[02:14:54.868 --> 02:14:59.171]  I'm here to beat the globalists, have our political ideology of liberty take the country back.
[02:15:00.376 --> 02:15:07.538]  Now we're going to get into, Dr. Group called me last night and then this morning and he said, no, I mean, I have it and nobody else has this.
[02:15:07.578 --> 02:15:08.178]  I can't believe it.
[02:15:08.759 --> 02:15:20.842]  And we have some special reports we're going to air at the bottom of the hour that Jakari Jackson put together on this a year and a half ago on Bill and Melinda Gates and the mosquitoes and engineering them, but that the Zika virus didn't come from Latin America.
[02:15:21.723 --> 02:15:25.644]  This is already broken in the news, but what's new is that it came from
[02:15:26.837 --> 02:15:29.018]  The Rockefeller Foundation, they actually own it.
[02:15:29.138 --> 02:15:29.899]  Zika virus.
[02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:33.901]  ATCC registered VR-84TM.
[02:15:34.282 --> 02:15:38.024]  They got it registered, patented and trademarked.
[02:15:38.044 --> 02:15:41.126]  1948 it was, 1947 it was discovered, patented in 1952.
[02:15:42.427 --> 02:15:48.891]  And now magically, we have this top bioweapons expert saying he believes it has been souped up and engineered.
[02:15:48.911 --> 02:15:50.552]  So we're going to be breaking that down in a moment.
[02:15:50.572 --> 02:15:54.094]  But before we do that, I just had a whole hour, skipped a break, didn't plug anything.
[02:15:54.154 --> 02:15:54.995]  I'm going to plug right now.
[02:15:56.206 --> 02:15:57.527]  We believe in win-win, folks.
[02:15:57.588 --> 02:15:59.329]  Treating people like we want to be treated.
[02:15:59.550 --> 02:16:04.115]  That's why we developed IntraCyticals with Dr. Grip and other top researchers, chemists, scientists, you name it.
[02:16:04.255 --> 02:16:05.216]  He's one of our advisors.
[02:16:06.417 --> 02:16:11.883]  To come up with products like AnthroPlex that is an original product that he made just for us.
[02:16:12.804 --> 02:16:14.786]  And this is a base
[02:16:15.698 --> 02:16:20.541]  System to make super male or super female vitality work even better.
[02:16:21.521 --> 02:16:34.629]  And let me tell you folks, just the amount of one of the herbs in there, you go to the gas station, they'll be the two or three pills for anywhere from $9 to $25, where you think, oh, I'm paying this much and you take it and whoa, it really works.
[02:16:34.729 --> 02:16:35.209]  I've never done it.
[02:16:35.229 --> 02:16:37.651]  I've talked to folks that have, you know, who have trouble in that department.
[02:16:38.091 --> 02:16:39.852]  I don't sell this as a sex aid, okay?
[02:16:40.533 --> 02:16:43.995]  The fact is, I sell it as energy, as outlook,
[02:16:45.731 --> 02:16:47.872]  And again, it's not like speed, like a Fedrin or something.
[02:16:48.412 --> 02:16:49.772]  It is natural.
[02:16:50.192 --> 02:16:54.073]  It just helps get your body pumping and going in the way you need to be going.
[02:16:54.473 --> 02:17:08.157]  And Dr. Group is here, until we go to break, to tell us about the latest product at Infowarslife.com, AnthroPlex, that out of the gates, and we do this all the time with the new product, we discount it out of the gates to get you to try it, knowing that you're going to love it.
[02:17:09.150 --> 02:17:09.790]  It'll sell out.
[02:17:10.031 --> 02:17:12.732]  The amount we have, it might be 2, 3, 4 months until we get more.
[02:17:12.772 --> 02:17:15.013]  Just like I told you DNA Force would sell out, sold out.
[02:17:15.534 --> 02:17:18.675]  We don't just tell you it's selling out to create that gimmick artificial scarcity.
[02:17:19.076 --> 02:17:24.419]  It really happens until we really get scaled up to where, you know, we don't really run out of the silver bullet very often.
[02:17:24.739 --> 02:17:28.401]  So, Infowarslife.com, Anthroplex, 15% off and free shipping.
[02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:35.503]  For the next two days only, when you get it with super male or female vitality.
[02:17:35.943 --> 02:17:37.244]  So now, let's go to Dr. Group.
[02:17:37.284 --> 02:17:38.885]  Group, we're going to break, obviously, in just three minutes.
[02:17:38.905 --> 02:17:40.906]  And you're going to have the floor when we come back on Zika.
[02:17:40.946 --> 02:17:41.807]  Thank you for being here.
[02:17:42.247 --> 02:17:45.169]  But get into this for us, if you can, please, sir.
[02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:49.672]  Why anthroplex is so important, and why you need both this and super male.
[02:17:49.892 --> 02:17:52.034]  You'll get great results, from my experience, with either one.
[02:17:52.834 --> 02:17:54.876]  This baby, though, is supercharged.
[02:17:55.476 --> 02:17:58.041]  And it's less expensive as well because it uses dry herbs.
[02:17:58.261 --> 02:17:59.564]  Obviously the Supermail is so great.
[02:17:59.584 --> 02:18:01.327]  It uses the wet herbs, cold press.
[02:18:01.628 --> 02:18:07.499]  Why do you call this the foundation to start the fire and then the Supermail takes you to the next level?
[02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:32.891]  Well, we just look at the base problem that's going on right now all over the world, which is the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the amount of estrogen that men have, the femininity of men, and what's going on even in children right now with low testosterone levels, low sperm count levels, and the problems that, and the attack that we're seeing on the endocrine systems of both male and female.
[02:18:33.391 --> 02:18:42.433]  So I'm always looking for ways to boost that and to make it more effective and naturally get the body to start producing these hormones and balancing themselves.
[02:18:43.253 --> 02:18:51.514]  That's why hormone replacement therapy, low T, all of that is such a booming business right now because so many people have the problem.
[02:18:52.094 --> 02:18:59.696]  So it's really hard when you look at a combination of herbs and minerals that you can put into a formula that will actually help
[02:19:00.516 --> 02:19:04.540]  Every individual, because technically every man is different.
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:17.010]  One guy might have severely decreased testosterone levels, growth hormone levels, DHEA levels, hormones out of whack because he drinks tons of fluoride and has an iodine deficiency and everything else.
[02:19:17.831 --> 02:19:19.272]  Somebody else might not.
[02:19:20.453 --> 02:19:28.921]  The whole purpose of us constantly working together, Alex, and talking about this for two years now is that it took seven years to develop super male vitality.
[02:19:28.941 --> 02:19:36.267]  I mean, we had to find the perfect unison and strength of the individual herbs, find the herbs we wanted to use, put them together,
[02:19:37.228 --> 02:19:55.764]  Do the cold extraction, the Spagyrex extraction technique that we invented that nobody else in the world has, which actually breaks the cell walls and ferments the plant and adds the salts back in and causes the therapeutic value to be 10 times, maybe 15 times what you would get from any natural supplements out there.
[02:19:56.545 --> 02:20:02.129]  And we perfected the super male and we're constantly looking for new suppliers and to make it even better and stronger.
[02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:07.313]  But during that process, we also wanted to add a few other things.
[02:20:07.574 --> 02:20:15.059]  But there comes a point when you're developing an herbal supplement where you don't want to put too much or too many herbs in one formula.
[02:20:15.099 --> 02:20:19.103]  Because the more you put in, the more you have to take out.
[02:20:19.283 --> 02:20:23.206]  Because you might have 500 milligrams as an active
[02:20:24.335 --> 02:20:26.796]  Therapeutic dose of tribulus terrestris, let's say.
[02:20:26.816 --> 02:20:32.217]  But if you want to put another herb in there, you might have to back that down to 400, and then it's going to take away the therapeutic benefits.
[02:20:32.237 --> 02:20:45.281]  So we wanted to keep the super male vitality strong, but we also wanted to add, because there's such a problem out there, another component that would boost the effects that people can take on a daily basis, men.
[02:20:46.661 --> 02:20:47.582]  That included zinc.
[02:20:47.602 --> 02:20:56.165]  I mean we could not figure out a way to mix the zinc in with the super male vitality and even if we did, you know, we didn't know.
[02:20:56.185 --> 02:21:01.427]  We don't want to mess with the Rolls Royce when we know that it's a fine-tuned engine and it's ready to go.
[02:21:01.567 --> 02:21:11.652]  So what we decided to do is how can we add a few other components in there that would actually boost the effectiveness of the super male vitality and at the same time
[02:21:12.472 --> 02:21:13.773]  What is in the goat weed?
[02:21:13.793 --> 02:21:15.435]  Everybody says that's so great.
[02:21:15.495 --> 02:21:17.537]  You've got one of the purest, strongest organic forms of it.
[02:21:17.557 --> 02:21:18.818]  What's so magic about the goat weed?
[02:21:33.911 --> 02:21:47.029]  Well the horny goat weed was given that name because years ago in India they noticed that a certain time of the year this weed would grow and the goats would eat it and they would just go crazy with all the female goats.
[02:21:47.109 --> 02:21:48.631]  So that's how it was developed.
[02:21:48.651 --> 02:21:49.592]  It's called epimidium.
[02:21:50.393 --> 02:22:02.885]  And what that's been proven to do over thousands of years, or at least in the last hundred with the limited amount of studies and tests that have been done on it, is increase sexual pleasure, help balance the male hormones.
[02:22:02.905 --> 02:22:04.666]  It can actually be used for women as well.
[02:22:05.107 --> 02:22:11.973]  But it really kind of resets and brings the hormone balance, improves sperm motility, and increases testosterone levels.
[02:22:11.993 --> 02:22:13.995]  So it counters the stuff they've been throwing at us.
[02:22:14.636 --> 02:22:15.136]  Let's go back.
[02:22:15.156 --> 02:22:15.977]  Now what's the next one?
[02:22:16.297 --> 02:22:17.098]  What's the next ingredient?
[02:22:17.138 --> 02:22:21.602]  So those are the two that we added that are not currently in Supermail.
[02:22:21.642 --> 02:22:23.063]  Then it's also got Tribulus.
[02:22:23.303 --> 02:22:29.369]  Tribulus Terrestris is in the Supermail Vitality, but this is an extra boost, for example.
[02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:37.336]  So let's say you have an engine and you have a race car and you're driving down the street and your race car is super fast and that would be the Supermail Vitality.
[02:22:37.356 --> 02:22:38.377]  You've got Tonga Cat.
[02:22:39.505 --> 02:22:51.457]  The Tongkat Ali, that's also an ingredient in Supermail Vitality, but those are just giving you that extra burst, that extra burst of ingredients to take you over the edge.
[02:22:52.538 --> 02:22:55.961]  I don't want to say this is a poor man's version, because it's not.
[02:22:56.262 --> 02:22:58.364]  It's got different ingredients, it's got some of the others.
[02:22:58.764 --> 02:23:02.388]  It is a little less because it's the dry herbs, even though they're sourced and organic.
[02:23:02.808 --> 02:23:08.973]  Still, when you get it and, you know, and there's still fresh fruit before you crush it, which is why we keep running out sometimes.
[02:23:09.433 --> 02:23:19.300]  I also said, look, I know we're perfect, everybody loves this and everything, we try to be the best, but could I have a dry herb so that when we run out of the wet herb, I'm not out of super male or female for six months like we've been before?
[02:23:19.621 --> 02:23:25.765]  And so that's also part of this thought process is something that does a lot of the same things, but for less money that we can keep in supply.
[02:23:25.805 --> 02:23:26.966]  But you explain, well, I can't do that.
[02:23:27.246 --> 02:23:29.348]  Super male is the best we could possibly come up with.
[02:23:29.648 --> 02:23:30.609]  So we came up with something that
[02:23:31.189 --> 02:23:34.830]  Is a base for it, has some of the same things, but misses some of the other things.
[02:23:35.530 --> 02:23:36.831]  And so overall, it's a win-win.
[02:23:36.891 --> 02:23:37.911]  See how it works for you.
[02:23:38.071 --> 02:23:38.511]  I know this.
[02:23:38.531 --> 02:23:40.472]  And I'm going to be done talking about it.
[02:23:40.492 --> 02:23:42.812]  Because I want to get into this whole virus situation.
[02:23:44.053 --> 02:23:44.473]  I know this.
[02:23:44.733 --> 02:23:48.474]  And I hate to get into personal stuff, but I went a year ago, had my blood tested.
[02:23:48.534 --> 02:23:52.475]  I took four ampules at a, you know, top medical doctor, just to see how I was doing.
[02:23:53.752 --> 02:23:54.433]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:24:15.299 --> 02:24:17.640]  But then I've gone back and had my blood taken.
[02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:23.983]  We're going to publish these facts soon and show people what I've been able to do religiously taking the products.
[02:24:24.003 --> 02:24:25.544]  I'm bad about only taking them a few times a week.
[02:24:25.604 --> 02:24:26.885]  I take stuff all the time now.
[02:24:27.325 --> 02:24:28.426]  I take the whole line now.
[02:24:28.446 --> 02:24:29.206]  People can see the difference.
[02:24:29.226 --> 02:24:31.067]  I'm going to take my shirt off soon, take a photo.
[02:24:31.667 --> 02:24:33.408]  Literally, I've almost got a six-pack.
[02:24:33.428 --> 02:24:36.490]  You can see it on the side now, even better than it was three months ago.
[02:24:36.890 --> 02:24:37.550]  It's insane.
[02:24:38.271 --> 02:24:42.313]  My problem is, on Anthroplex, it gets me even more crazed.
[02:24:42.953 --> 02:24:43.353]  I don't know.
[02:25:14.127 --> 02:25:18.415]  You take Super Male or Anthroplex
[02:25:19.770 --> 02:25:21.410]  It is DRAMATIC!
[02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:23.711]  I mean, it is DRAMATIC!
[02:25:23.911 --> 02:25:26.452]  And again, I hate to get into the libido angle of things.
[02:25:26.712 --> 02:25:29.232]  That's not, if you go back 3-4 years, how I pitch Supermill.
[02:25:29.592 --> 02:25:32.633]  It's the energy, it's the stamina, the better mood, wanting to work out.
[02:25:32.873 --> 02:25:34.133]  That's what Shane Steiner talked about.
[02:25:34.533 --> 02:25:35.434]  And his wife talked about.
[02:25:35.814 --> 02:25:40.495]  It's just that added area is where you KNOW there's a big difference.
[02:25:40.895 --> 02:25:43.996]  And there's no debating that what's in this is powerful.
[02:25:44.016 --> 02:25:45.416]  Because you were telling me yesterday,
[02:25:47.022 --> 02:25:47.684]  Or maybe it was last week.
[02:25:47.704 --> 02:25:52.115]  Whenever you were here, you were saying, you know, Alex, uh... No, it was yesterday on the phone.
[02:25:52.135 --> 02:25:52.616]  That's right.
[02:25:53.458 --> 02:25:54.240]  It all mixes together.
[02:25:55.094 --> 02:25:58.375]  You were like, oh yeah, if you take a bunch of Supermel and take this, it's like a Viagra.
[02:25:58.395 --> 02:25:59.576]  And I said, like a Viagra?
[02:25:59.856 --> 02:26:01.377]  This doesn't work as good as that.
[02:26:01.417 --> 02:26:06.038]  Because then, obviously, I was sitting there, being honest, saying this Cialis didn't do anything.
[02:26:06.158 --> 02:26:09.280]  I wanted it as a scientific test to then get a prescription for the other.
[02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:11.841]  And all it did was make my face turn red and give me a headache.
[02:26:11.861 --> 02:26:12.641]  And I'm not knocking it.
[02:26:12.881 --> 02:26:14.082]  I'm sure it's great for some other people.
[02:26:14.342 --> 02:26:18.063]  But how breakthrough is it, how amazing herbs are that God gave us?
[02:26:18.523 --> 02:26:19.704]  I mean, it's insane, Dr. Group.
[02:26:19.884 --> 02:26:30.831]  Yeah, I mean, I don't want people to think that, hey, this is something that is just all men need to take, because this is actually for a serious problem that we're suffering from today, and it's called andropause, menopause.
[02:26:30.871 --> 02:26:36.094]  I mean, women go through these hormonal changes in their life, and that's menopause.
[02:26:36.455 --> 02:26:37.535]  Ours is more gradual.
[02:26:37.615 --> 02:26:38.116]  We don't know.
[02:26:38.156 --> 02:26:44.200]  We've already basically hit menopause by 35 or 40 because of the chemicals in the food and water, the plastics.
[02:26:45.140 --> 02:26:45.680]  Exactly.
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:48.101]  We have an estrogen dominance that's going on.
[02:26:48.201 --> 02:26:53.402]  We have low testosterone, altered hormone levels because our endocrine systems are out of whack.
[02:26:53.782 --> 02:27:07.205]  And this is actually a solution to help you naturally, obviously, you want to avoid all the phthalates and the chemicals and the xenoestrogens and everything that's causing your hormone imbalance and the estrogen mimicking chemicals.
[02:27:07.245 --> 02:27:10.785]  And you want to use the iodine to get rid of the fluoride and the chlorine and the bromine.
[02:27:10.805 --> 02:27:13.366]  And you want to change your diet and eat organic and all those other things.
[02:27:13.886 --> 02:27:16.650]  Which help balance your hormones naturally anyway.
[02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:20.975]  But the fact of the matter is we don't get those hormones back.
[02:27:21.015 --> 02:27:24.479]  We don't slowly start increasing our hormones as men as we age.
[02:27:24.639 --> 02:27:26.501]  We keep declining and declining.
[02:27:26.521 --> 02:27:27.803]  People ask where are the men?
[02:27:27.883 --> 02:27:29.465]  It's an admitted globalist program.
[02:27:29.485 --> 02:27:32.849]  We're coming back to cover the mosquitoes here in a moment and then shift off of this.
[02:27:32.889 --> 02:27:33.670]  But bottom line...
[02:27:34.130 --> 02:27:36.092]  There is a program to demasculate.
[02:27:36.492 --> 02:27:51.168]  There is a program to have chemicals in the food and water and in the plastics, the bisphenol A, on record that is making male fish and male frogs, both fish and amphibians, turn bisexual or stop reproducing entirely or become female.
[02:27:51.428 --> 02:27:55.192]  Because in those species, if they're hit with hormones, they can actually switch sexes in some of them.
[02:27:55.612 --> 02:28:01.894]  So, some roosters are now turning into chickens.
[02:28:02.194 --> 02:28:04.195]  And I didn't believe that when I saw it in the news last year.
[02:28:04.215 --> 02:28:05.115]  I didn't know they could switch.
[02:28:05.455 --> 02:28:10.497]  But, I mean, it is crazy what the chemicals are doing to everybody.
[02:28:10.577 --> 02:28:11.257]  It is just nuts.
[02:28:11.277 --> 02:28:13.918]  And then women are sold, oh, it's great to be super feminine.
[02:28:13.978 --> 02:28:16.039]  It's not super feminine to have all this estrogen.
[02:28:16.299 --> 02:28:17.360]  It's what gives you breast cancer.
[02:28:17.380 --> 02:28:18.720]  It's what accelerates your aging.
[02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:21.161]  Women have way too much estrogen too.
[02:28:21.781 --> 02:28:29.527]  If you're a guy and you're not waking up with an erection like three times a week, then you most likely have low testosterone levels.
[02:28:29.927 --> 02:28:36.893]  So I mean, you think of how many billions of men out there that are being affected by high estrogen and low testosterone.
[02:28:37.273 --> 02:28:44.538]  And believe it or not, it's not when you have high testosterone that you're angry and you're aggressive and you're irritable.
[02:28:44.698 --> 02:28:48.801]  It's usually when you have low testosterone is when you're irritable and depressed.
[02:28:49.101 --> 02:28:57.046]  And it's not only that, there's a whole list of symptoms that comes along with andropause and low testosterone and low hormone levels in men.
[02:28:57.126 --> 02:28:58.367]  Just the way you feel.
[02:28:58.787 --> 02:29:00.288]  You get tired in the afternoon.
[02:29:00.348 --> 02:29:05.031]  I've heard some people, some guys with low testosterone say they drink 12 cups of coffee a day.
[02:29:05.091 --> 02:29:05.411]  Insane!
[02:29:05.431 --> 02:29:06.472]  That burns out your adrenals.
[02:29:06.852 --> 02:29:13.154]  So why not address it naturally with herbs that have been proven year after year after year after year?
[02:29:14.015 --> 02:29:15.075]  Sure, exactly.
[02:29:15.215 --> 02:29:17.036]  Because results will vary overall.
[02:29:17.476 --> 02:29:19.297]  All I know is dynamite.
[02:29:19.737 --> 02:29:25.399]  I mean absolutely dynamite with stamina, with the weight lifting, with the swimming, with the
[02:29:26.239 --> 02:29:36.965]  Uh, I mean, instead of drinking coffee to go on Coast to Coast AM or something when they invite me on, I will go and take five or six quarts of Supermental Vitality, and boom, it has that effect, but it's natural.
[02:29:36.985 --> 02:29:37.845]  It's not a stimulant.
[02:29:37.885 --> 02:29:41.167]  It gets my body to naturally release the things that stimulate it.
[02:29:41.467 --> 02:29:42.788]  Folks, the new product is available.
[02:29:43.388 --> 02:29:46.450]  Anthroplex, available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:29:46.811 --> 02:29:48.952]  Dr. Group, thank you for developing this amazing product.
[02:29:49.112 --> 02:29:49.513]  Thank you.
[02:29:49.873 --> 02:29:54.336]  We're going to come back on the other side and shift gears into how else they're manipulating us.
[02:29:54.576 --> 02:29:54.996]  Zika.
[02:29:55.317 --> 02:29:57.218]  You're going to get the incredible facts straight ahead.
[02:29:58.459 --> 02:29:59.360]  We're on the march.
[02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:01.461]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.382 --> 02:30:05.064]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:09.102 --> 02:30:13.566]  Sometimes when people are offended, they want to just come in and say, stop that.
[02:30:13.766 --> 02:30:15.887]  Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
[02:30:16.088 --> 02:30:20.591]  If you start saying, we mustn't criticize or offend them, then humor's gone.
[02:30:20.952 --> 02:30:22.893]  With humor goes a sense of proportion.
[02:30:23.233 --> 02:30:25.435]  And then as far as I'm concerned, you're living in 1984.
[02:30:26.636 --> 02:30:28.858]  That was John Cleese of Monty Python.
[02:30:29.138 --> 02:30:32.542]  Political correctness is not a case of people who are well-meaning but neurotic.
[02:30:32.762 --> 02:30:36.626]  Not even spoiled and tolerant brats screaming at you with their hands over their ears.
[02:30:36.906 --> 02:30:39.228]  It's a weaponized tool of social control.
[02:30:39.489 --> 02:30:41.490]  You're accused of heresy on three counts.
[02:30:41.811 --> 02:30:44.493]  Heresy by thought, heresy by word, heresy by deed, and heresy by action.
[02:30:44.533 --> 02:30:45.294]  Four counts.
[02:30:46.235 --> 02:30:50.336]  We should recognize the source where these weapons of social control are forged.
[02:30:50.737 --> 02:30:51.617]  The universities.
[02:30:52.037 --> 02:30:57.139]  Colleges are increasingly irrelevant to education, but essential to indoctrination.
[02:30:57.399 --> 02:31:05.462]  This is why Bernie and Hillary are so eager to extend kindergarten social control for free until people reach their mid-twenties or beyond.
[02:31:05.482 --> 02:31:08.063]  For Prison Planet TV, I'm David Knight.
[02:31:09.003 --> 02:31:13.204]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[02:31:13.384 --> 02:31:17.346]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[02:31:17.526 --> 02:31:22.307]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:31:22.467 --> 02:31:27.009]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[02:31:27.129 --> 02:31:30.470]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:31:30.610 --> 02:31:33.911]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:34.071 --> 02:31:35.891]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:31:38.752 --> 02:31:39.674]  Brain Force is here.
[02:31:39.854 --> 02:31:41.977]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:31:42.057 --> 02:31:46.823]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:31:47.064 --> 02:31:50.228]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:31:50.348 --> 02:31:53.573]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:31:53.853 --> 02:31:55.536]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:31:55.796 --> 02:31:56.717]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:31:56.737 --> 02:31:57.678]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:31:57.918 --> 02:31:59.780]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:31:59.920 --> 02:32:06.706]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:07.546 --> 02:32:14.913]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[02:32:15.365 --> 02:32:18.488]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[02:32:18.508 --> 02:32:24.795]  I needed to get my digestive system working correctly again, so I stumbled on the X2.
[02:32:24.895 --> 02:32:28.299]  We look at a product like Survival Shield Nasal Iodine X2.
[02:32:28.519 --> 02:32:32.082]  It's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[02:32:32.403 --> 02:32:34.125]  I needed a detox basically.
[02:32:39.136 --> 02:32:42.580]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[02:32:42.780 --> 02:32:43.841]  What do you have to lose?
[02:32:44.102 --> 02:32:52.672]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[02:32:53.124 --> 02:32:56.766]  I noticed significant change in my digestive flow.
[02:32:56.786 --> 02:32:58.486]  I was like really more natural.
[02:32:58.766 --> 02:33:03.789]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:33:20.436 --> 02:33:21.157]  Big Brother.
[02:33:21.597 --> 02:33:22.839]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:23.359 --> 02:33:24.340]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:25.281 --> 02:33:26.703]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:26.963 --> 02:33:28.104]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:28.625 --> 02:33:33.210]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:47.711 --> 02:33:58.413]  All right, before we get into the Zika virus and the fact that it's ATTCC registered VR-84 owned by the Rockefeller Foundation and now deployed,
[02:34:00.011 --> 02:34:04.254]  Before we get into all that, remember, I had the author of the U.S.
[02:34:04.535 --> 02:34:05.556]  and U.N.
[02:34:05.596 --> 02:34:18.706]  ratified Biological Weapons Treaty, the global treaty, on last Friday, Dr. Francis Boyle, saying he's talked to his high-level genetic engineer associates, and they concur, they've taken Zika and souped it up.
[02:34:19.227 --> 02:34:24.131]  Because it now, and he said this before it was in the news, it is being transferred by sex and saliva.
[02:34:25.506 --> 02:34:31.488]  But he's saying it could also be a cover for other things in the vaccines that are causing the same type of mutations in utero.
[02:34:32.008 --> 02:34:35.169]  So, we're not sure exactly what's happening, but boy, it is suspicious.
[02:34:35.529 --> 02:34:39.790]  Like Hillary winning six twin causes in a row in all the disputed areas of Iowa.
[02:34:40.090 --> 02:34:47.172]  We also have Joe Biggs' piece coming up later where he did the joke piece on Hillary with that in downtown Austin yesterday.
[02:34:47.492 --> 02:34:50.333]  But before we do that, here's a report from a year and a half ago.
[02:34:51.954 --> 02:35:02.863]  Now malaria is, of course, transmitted by mosquitoes.
[02:35:03.344 --> 02:35:07.307]  I brought some here so you could experience this.
[02:35:07.347 --> 02:35:12.552]  We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.
[02:35:13.993 --> 02:35:17.996]  There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
[02:35:20.515 --> 02:35:26.360]  That was Bill Gates laughing about how he plans to use mosquitoes to force Medicaid against malaria.
[02:35:26.780 --> 02:35:35.408]  With horrible side effects accompanying voluntary vaccinations, I for one want to be in control of the needle, whether it comes from a pharmacist or a mosquito's face.
[02:35:36.348 --> 02:35:43.294]  In a world where taking too much cough syrup can send you to the hospital, can't taking too many vaccinations do the same thing?
[02:35:43.955 --> 02:35:47.878]  That's exactly what Nazi scientists were hoping for during World War II.
[02:35:49.079 --> 02:35:52.800]  They wanted to use mosquitoes as bioweapons to poison their opposition.
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:57.601]  A dream that was fulfilled when they switched out the mosquitoes for ticks on Plum Island.
[02:35:58.282 --> 02:35:59.602]  Years ago, the U.S.
[02:35:59.642 --> 02:36:05.604]  government brought Nazi mines to the states under Operation Paperclip to carry out various scientific functions.
[02:36:06.264 --> 02:36:10.185]  On Plum Island, Eric Traub experimented with ticks as bioweapons.
[02:36:10.825 --> 02:36:16.247]  In the 1970s, Lyme, Connecticut had an outbreak of what is now known as Lyme disease.
[02:36:16.607 --> 02:36:21.829]  There have been other strange occurrences that many speculate are related to the work done on Plum Island.
[02:36:22.289 --> 02:36:24.810]  So go ahead, opt out of vaccinating your child.
[02:36:25.210 --> 02:36:27.411]  Bill Gates and Eric Traub have the medicine.
[02:36:27.731 --> 02:36:30.632]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.
[02:36:32.662 --> 02:36:33.503]  And we're back live.
[02:36:33.523 --> 02:36:45.673]  I want to go to another clip of Bill Gates, where he's talking about equations at a TED Talk, and showing what numbers have to be brought down to zero, and he points at humans being brought down to zero, and the crowd laughs.
[02:36:46.834 --> 02:37:00.886]  And again, I won't go over the background, because we won't go into the specifics here, but Bill and Melinda Gates and their whole foundation in Microsoft itself is a giant IBM front of Planned Parenthood.
[02:37:02.096 --> 02:37:05.958]  His father ran Planned Parenthood, and it's the whole shadow government.
[02:37:06.658 --> 02:37:15.481]  His father was in Army Intelligence after World War II, and basically was in charge of bringing a lot of the science over to IBM, and IBM had financed Hitler from the beginning.
[02:37:15.521 --> 02:37:19.183]  Just search Thomas Watson, founder of IBM, with Hitler.
[02:37:19.403 --> 02:37:20.843]  You'll see the photos, the films.
[02:37:21.143 --> 02:37:25.245]  He won the highest award in Germany, one that Hitler didn't even get.
[02:37:25.265 --> 02:37:29.907]  So he was considered the most important man in Germany.
[02:37:30.871 --> 02:37:34.193]  And would actually travel there during the first year or so of World War II.
[02:37:35.694 --> 02:37:38.515]  Just like the King of England had to advocate because he got caught being a Nazi.
[02:37:39.276 --> 02:37:43.198]  In pop culture they tell you it was because he married an American woman, pure bull, though she was a big Nazi.
[02:37:43.498 --> 02:37:45.339]  We're not saying it's a Nazi conspiracy.
[02:37:45.880 --> 02:37:53.584]  We're saying that the technology, the ideas that kind of came from here went to Germany and then came back home to where they came from.
[02:37:53.884 --> 02:37:56.566]  So let's go to Bill Gates talking about population control.
[02:37:58.008 --> 02:37:59.470]  First, we've got population.
[02:38:00.250 --> 02:38:02.492]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[02:38:02.972 --> 02:38:04.574]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[02:38:05.194 --> 02:38:14.302]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[02:38:14.362 --> 02:38:15.143]  Lower population?
[02:38:15.163 --> 02:38:18.446]  There we see an increase of about 1.3.
[02:38:19.246 --> 02:38:22.149]  Now, malaria is, of course, transmitted by mosquitoes.
[02:38:22.649 --> 02:38:26.611]  I brought some here so you could experience this.
[02:38:26.631 --> 02:38:31.834]  We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.
[02:38:33.295 --> 02:38:39.658]  There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
[02:38:40.379 --> 02:38:42.520]  And again, I didn't give much direction this morning.
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:45.882]  There's another clip where he talks about bringing the number down to zero specifically and I laugh.
[02:38:46.542 --> 02:38:47.483]  We'll find that and get that.
[02:38:47.523 --> 02:38:48.523]  I saw Rob do it in the studio.
[02:38:48.543 --> 02:38:51.485]  We'll see if he sends over the specific longer one I want to get.
[02:38:52.105 --> 02:38:53.966]  That's important to focus on this Gates stuff.
[02:38:53.986 --> 02:38:56.627]  We'll create a super clip of it in the near future.
[02:38:56.667 --> 02:38:58.348]  But this is his known background.
[02:38:58.368 --> 02:38:59.489]  This is what he stands for.
[02:38:59.509 --> 02:39:05.892]  He gave a Bill Moyers interview 20 years ago that we found clips of online where he breaks down his whole plan.
[02:39:06.793 --> 02:39:09.234]  So here's a mad scientist involved in weather weapons.
[02:39:10.535 --> 02:39:13.016]  A guy involved in controlling our schools, our education.
[02:39:13.276 --> 02:39:15.337]  He's the biggest funder of gun control in the U.S.
[02:39:15.377 --> 02:39:16.118]  Then it's Bloomberg.
[02:39:17.133 --> 02:39:20.056]  He's the guy running the elections in Iowa and many other areas.
[02:39:20.536 --> 02:39:21.957]  He's involved in everything.
[02:39:23.038 --> 02:39:23.999]  And now here he is.
[02:39:24.700 --> 02:39:28.243]  Let's get into Zika, Dr. Group, and what you think's going on.
[02:39:29.024 --> 02:39:31.306]  A new weapon to fight Zika, the mosquito.
[02:39:31.726 --> 02:39:39.193]  When it comes to killing humans, no other animal even comes close, Bill Gates, whose foundation fights disease globally, has written.
[02:39:40.248 --> 02:39:59.319]  So, Hiding in Plain View, and then we have Zika virus, A-T-C-C-R-V-R-8-4, owned by the Rockefeller Foundation, blood from experimental forest sentinel rhesus monkeys, Uganda, 1947, and now it pops up in Latin America, and tell us what it supposedly does.
[02:39:59.339 --> 02:40:00.260]  Dr. Rupp, you've got the floor.
[02:40:00.580 --> 02:40:15.766]  Well there's no doubt that this is bioengineered and the scary thing is when you start messing around, we know how bad GMO crops are, but GMO animals, we know about transhumanism, we know about all the experimentation with genetic codes being spliced into animals.
[02:40:16.646 --> 02:40:20.228]  Now we're talking about genetically modified mosquitoes and
[02:40:21.539 --> 02:40:23.140]  Created bioweapons.
[02:40:23.500 --> 02:40:29.643]  I mean, I guess they can say they founded in 1947 in Uganda in the Rhesus monkey.
[02:40:30.343 --> 02:40:41.769]  And then the Rockefeller Foundation back then involved in different types of biowarfare and vaccine production and viral studies in South America.
[02:40:42.549 --> 02:40:43.150]  We're good to go.
[02:40:52.495 --> 02:40:54.056]  Mosquitoes are a vector.
[02:40:54.076 --> 02:40:54.836]  It's just like a needle.
[02:40:54.876 --> 02:40:55.957]  It's just like a vaccine.
[02:40:56.037 --> 02:40:59.539]  So all of the people out there saying, well, I don't want to be vaccinated anymore.
[02:40:59.759 --> 02:41:00.539]  Well, guess what?
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:04.922]  You're going to have genetically modified mosquitoes running around and flying around everywhere.
[02:41:05.022 --> 02:41:07.283]  And he admits that's his plan.
[02:41:07.323 --> 02:41:13.686]  In fact, he's the one pioneering vaccines in fruit and vegetables where it grows pharmacologically in the fruit.
[02:41:13.987 --> 02:41:14.767]  You don't have a choice.
[02:41:14.807 --> 02:41:16.248]  He's all about making you take it.
[02:41:16.468 --> 02:41:18.189]  And I guess they're making us take Zika.
[02:41:18.869 --> 02:41:20.050]  They're making us take Zika.
[02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:43.795]  The what they're trying to it's if you trace back the Zika virus to the Rockefeller Foundation and then you look at Oxitec which by the way mysteriously was just bought out by Intrexon and if you trace back the board of directors and everything like that for Intrexon is majorly owned by Fidelity Investments.
[02:41:44.215 --> 02:41:49.639]  I mean you can look at you can easily just keep going back and going back and tracing this whole trail.
[02:41:49.979 --> 02:41:51.120]  The question is why?
[02:41:51.420 --> 02:41:52.620]  Why all of a sudden?
[02:41:52.660 --> 02:41:56.182]  I mean every two years we have something, usually exactly in two years.
[02:41:57.102 --> 02:41:59.443]  I said last time with Ebola that that was a test.
[02:41:59.523 --> 02:42:04.925]  You agreed that that was a big test to see how the public was going to react with the fear, everything else.
[02:42:05.505 --> 02:42:11.087]  We knew that there wasn't really going to be a vaccine even though we heard they were working on one.
[02:42:11.847 --> 02:42:13.888]  I think with the Zika virus it's
[02:42:14.895 --> 02:42:21.981]  Well, number one, Intrexron's stock has gone up, the genetically modified mosquito production company.
[02:42:22.542 --> 02:42:23.683]  Oh, isn't that just cute?
[02:42:24.704 --> 02:42:31.470]  And now, all of a sudden, they said today that there's an Indian corporation that has two vaccines.
[02:42:31.510 --> 02:42:34.233]  So with this, you're obviously going to look at
[02:42:35.327 --> 02:42:49.133]  Getting people sick, reducing the population, you're going to look at vaccine production, of course, and you're also going to test and see what this does to the environment and how it affects all phases of different animals as well.
[02:42:49.693 --> 02:42:56.536]  Right now, I just saw just a few minutes ago, actually, that this company in India
[02:42:57.956 --> 02:43:02.621]  Has developed two vaccinations or I mean anytime stuff comes like this comes out.
[02:43:02.782 --> 02:43:05.304]  This has already been in the works for years and years.
[02:43:05.324 --> 02:43:07.207]  And so we said I bet there's gonna be a vaccine.
[02:43:07.347 --> 02:43:08.088]  It's already being made.
[02:43:08.868 --> 02:43:10.190]  And how convenient.
[02:43:10.390 --> 02:43:12.132]  I can't remember the name of the company in India.
[02:43:12.172 --> 02:43:13.594]  We'll just Google it.
[02:43:13.634 --> 02:43:14.335]  I saw it yesterday.
[02:43:14.455 --> 02:43:16.477]  Indian company develops Zika vaccine.
[02:43:16.497 --> 02:43:17.238]  You can pull it up guys.
[02:43:17.458 --> 02:43:17.658]  Yeah.
[02:43:17.758 --> 02:43:20.439]  Funded, by the way, by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:43:20.459 --> 02:43:20.799]  Of course.
[02:43:20.979 --> 02:43:21.999]  Yeah.
[02:43:22.660 --> 02:43:25.320]  So the best thing you can do, in my opinion... There it is.
[02:43:25.601 --> 02:43:28.821]  World's first Zika virus vaccine made in India.
[02:43:29.142 --> 02:43:31.282]  Claims scientists, Bill and Melinda Gates, funding it.
[02:43:31.962 --> 02:43:32.803]  Thank God they love us.
[02:43:33.563 --> 02:43:41.925]  So the big story here is, pay attention to this and be aware that if this can happen,
[02:43:44.463 --> 02:43:47.505]  Also, you have to look at what's going on in Brazil.
[02:43:47.765 --> 02:43:50.768]  Why are all these mosquitoes being released in Brazil?
[02:43:51.148 --> 02:43:54.991]  Well, you have the Olympics in Brazil, Summer Olympics in 2016.
[02:43:55.471 --> 02:44:06.619]  You're going to have representatives and people, contestants, athletes, fans from every country in the world in one central location.
[02:44:07.039 --> 02:44:08.741]  And that's where they're releasing this virus.
[02:44:09.341 --> 02:44:13.844]  So it's a perfect vector to spread this disease all over.
[02:44:13.924 --> 02:44:23.330]  Now they say it can be... But even better, then everybody's got to have the vaccine when you, quote, get your shots to go to Brazil, and then who knows what'll be in the Bill and Melinda Gates-developed Zika vaccine.
[02:44:24.031 --> 02:44:24.511]  Exactly.
[02:44:24.751 --> 02:44:25.312]  The vaccine...
[02:44:26.897 --> 02:44:39.882]  And now they're telling people not to have babies till 2018 and the pesticide levels that what I hear are going to be sprayed not only in South America, Brazil, but all over the world.
[02:44:39.942 --> 02:44:44.204]  The USDA just approved a new super roundup herbicide.
[02:44:44.224 --> 02:44:45.684]  I've got that article right here actually.
[02:44:45.704 --> 02:44:49.866]  So you're going to have billions and billions of tons of extra pesticides being
[02:44:50.606 --> 02:44:57.288]  Sprayed upon us, and you're going to have more hospital visits, which is good for the pharmaceutical industry.
[02:44:57.308 --> 02:44:58.768]  Let me ask you this question, Dr. Group.
[02:44:59.468 --> 02:45:09.471]  Why isn't anybody other than the top bioweapons expert in the U.S., and us and a few others, pointing out that it's suspicious that Bill and Melinda Gates, they're connected to Zika.
[02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:12.823]  They say they want to reduce our population.
[02:45:12.863 --> 02:45:14.685]  The White House Science Center wants to do it.
[02:45:15.066 --> 02:45:17.129]  You've got the Rockefeller Foundation owns it.
[02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:19.151]  They're developing a vaccine.
[02:45:19.171 --> 02:45:20.253]  They're the usual suspects.
[02:45:21.014 --> 02:45:23.478]  I mean, why are they so obvious about what they do?
[02:45:23.938 --> 02:45:26.982]  I think it's where Bill Gates opens up the mosquitoes.
[02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:34.445]  In the crowd in the room and says it's okay to reduce our population and points at the board with an equation to bring us down to zero.
[02:45:34.905 --> 02:45:36.466]  I mean, he's just there doing it.
[02:45:36.486 --> 02:45:39.589]  He goes, there's no reason only the poor people should have to go through this.
[02:45:39.989 --> 02:45:44.532]  And he's actually telling you metaphysically what he's doing to you in front of you.
[02:45:45.453 --> 02:45:48.035]  For some reason in lore, that's what bad guys have to do.
[02:45:48.055 --> 02:45:50.257]  They have to tell you first what they're going to do.
[02:45:51.616 --> 02:45:59.941]  Well, see, the genetically modified mosquitoes are males, and what they're designed to do is mate with the females in nature.
[02:46:00.001 --> 02:46:10.927]  So what you're doing is you're taking a genetically modified mosquito, made by man, and you're introducing it into nature, which is a natural mosquito.
[02:46:11.148 --> 02:46:15.970]  So automatically, you're going to have alterations in genetic codes for the offspring.
[02:46:16.291 --> 02:46:18.212]  So what it's designed to do is stop
[02:46:18.812 --> 02:46:24.798]  The female mosquito from replicating that Zika virus and it's supposed to kill the larva.
[02:46:25.578 --> 02:46:30.743]  The problem with that is and the reason if you look into the research why all those mosquitoes were released in Brazil.
[02:46:30.763 --> 02:46:32.104]  You can actually soup them up.
[02:46:32.184 --> 02:46:37.990]  It's actually they're souping them up claiming it's an eradication program and after they do that suddenly it explodes and gets worse.
[02:46:39.060 --> 02:46:43.222]  So the headline is, after Bill and Melinda Gates tinker with Zika, it gets worse.
[02:46:43.762 --> 02:46:53.005]  Well, what they're failing to mention is the fact that Brazil has the highest level of tetracycline, which is an antibiotic, of any other country.
[02:46:53.206 --> 02:46:58.367]  And more tetracycline is used for animals and humans than anywhere else in the world.
[02:46:58.908 --> 02:47:01.869]  And there's high levels of tetracycline in all the water supply.
[02:47:01.889 --> 02:47:02.169]  That's right.
[02:47:02.229 --> 02:47:07.151]  We think America is cheating with chemicals and with drugs for the animals.
[02:47:07.791 --> 02:47:08.912]  You think we have beef, folks?
[02:47:08.932 --> 02:47:12.535]  We have nothing compared to Brazil, or Chile, or all those countries.
[02:47:13.055 --> 02:47:14.116]  We don't produce the beef here.
[02:47:14.536 --> 02:47:17.158]  And absolutely, they are just feeding them whatever they want down there.
[02:47:17.718 --> 02:47:30.627]  Well, what happens is, these genetically modified mosquitoes, if there's a presence of tiny, tiny amounts of tetracycline, it does not kill the larva, like it's supposed to, of the female.
[02:47:30.667 --> 02:47:32.789]  It makes them drug-resistant, including the Zika.
[02:47:33.129 --> 02:47:41.433]  Yeah, so they've even admitted up to 15% of the mosquitoes are now new strains of mosquitoes that are being developed with the Zika.
[02:47:41.453 --> 02:47:49.938]  So it doesn't even, with the tetracycline in the water... And by the way, imagine all the thousands of cross-species chimeras, the pharmacological crops.
[02:47:50.418 --> 02:47:56.381]  Now zoologically, you don't get diseases, your dog does, but now, forget dog, we can get insect diseases.
[02:47:56.681 --> 02:48:01.063]  I mean, we are just breaking all the bonds and allowing everything to jump cross-species.
[02:48:01.403 --> 02:48:02.264]  Totally insane.
[02:48:03.444 --> 02:48:04.064]  Here's an example.
[02:48:04.184 --> 02:48:15.830]  If just putting ducks next to pigs in China, and their feces runs together in slurries, gives us almost all the super flu, just running those two viral groups together, imagine what splicing them does.
[02:48:16.450 --> 02:48:17.250]  Ugh, yeah.
[02:48:17.570 --> 02:48:19.891]  It's only a matter of time till some super bug is released.
[02:48:19.952 --> 02:48:20.552]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:48:22.105 --> 02:48:22.385]  It is!
[02:48:22.706 --> 02:48:34.034]  That's why it's so important to know about how to keep your immune system strong to where you can look at all of this stuff and all this fear-mongering and everything else out there and not necessarily fear-mongering.
[02:48:34.054 --> 02:48:39.278]  I mean, I can't help it if I go out in my yard living in Houston where we have mosquitoes all over the place.
[02:48:39.898 --> 02:48:50.046]  As a matter of fact, just today they confirmed somebody in Texas got the Zika virus from sexually transmitted and now they're saying through saliva as well.
[02:48:51.912 --> 02:48:56.035]  And by the way, that's what Dr. Boyle was saying two weeks ago.
[02:48:56.835 --> 02:48:57.055]  Yes.
[02:48:57.476 --> 02:48:58.496]  Yeah, I watched that interview.
[02:48:58.516 --> 02:48:59.117]  That was great.
[02:48:59.137 --> 02:49:01.898]  He said that last Friday, but we were reading his papers a week and a half before that.
[02:49:02.238 --> 02:49:04.079]  So he had his sources saying this before it came out.
[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:05.620]  And he's saying it is a bioweapon.
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:06.321]  It's been souped up.
[02:49:06.541 --> 02:49:07.581]  And now we have it directly linked to it.
[02:49:07.642 --> 02:49:09.603]  In fact, we should get him back on now with all this new info.
[02:49:10.343 --> 02:49:14.686]  So the solution to that for everybody listening is just keep your immune system strong.
[02:49:14.726 --> 02:49:15.746]  You know, get lots of sleep.
[02:49:15.786 --> 02:49:16.627]  Don't stress out.
[02:49:17.187 --> 02:49:17.907]  Take vitamin C.
[02:49:19.028 --> 02:49:22.291]  Take some zinc, by the way, which is an anthroplex.
[02:49:22.971 --> 02:49:24.152]  Keep your body cleansed.
[02:49:24.232 --> 02:49:26.273]  Keep your self-healing mechanism strong.
[02:49:26.694 --> 02:49:28.375]  There's a lot of different herbs out there.
[02:49:28.395 --> 02:49:30.336]  Oregano, oil, iodine.
[02:49:30.757 --> 02:49:36.821]  They also admit that one flu shot cuts your immune system by 50% for at least a year.
[02:49:37.642 --> 02:49:38.803]  I mean, no wonder we're so sick.
[02:49:38.823 --> 02:49:44.307]  The vaccines people are taking lowers their immunity and then they're incubators for all these bugs.
[02:49:45.404 --> 02:49:45.845]  That's right.
[02:49:46.285 --> 02:50:06.447]  And I tell you another thing, you have, I haven't looked into this, but it wouldn't surprise me if whatever company owns off and all the mosquito, the toxic mosquito repellents, which just add to the problem even more because now you have people spraying that stuff all over their body, all over their kids, and those are some of the most toxic pesticides and
[02:50:07.068 --> 02:50:15.153]  Thalates and fragrances and chemicals that are just going to alter your hormone levels and shut down or alter your endocrine system anyway.
[02:50:15.213 --> 02:50:29.303]  So if the mosquitoes and the Zika virus isn't bad, look at all the things that's going to come from the pollution in the water supplies from all the pesticides and then all the people that are in fear and are spraying.
[02:50:29.323 --> 02:50:36.548]  I mean, I know actually people in Houston right now that are spraying their kids down before they go to school in the morning with OFF.
[02:50:37.628 --> 02:50:42.369]  Even though normal Zika is just a mild fever, are they worried their kids are about to get pregnant?
[02:50:42.389 --> 02:50:48.790]  I mean, don't you have to get bitten by them and be actively dealing with Zika when a baby is chest staining to actually have the problem?
[02:50:50.631 --> 02:50:56.692]  I don't think we've really come to analyzing the different types of symptoms and problems we might be dealing with yet.
[02:50:56.712 --> 02:50:57.352]  All right, stay there.
[02:50:57.372 --> 02:50:58.852]  Let's talk some about that on the other side.
[02:50:59.193 --> 02:51:01.873]  And we do have the Bill Gates zero population clip ready.
[02:51:02.213 --> 02:51:05.534]  When we come back, I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:51:05.574 --> 02:51:06.014]  Stay with us.

[02:52:09.046 --> 02:52:12.469]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:52:13.269 --> 02:52:13.770]  It's true.
[02:52:13.890 --> 02:52:17.873]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:52:18.054 --> 02:52:19.915]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:52:20.436 --> 02:52:24.920]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:37.812]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[02:53:14.636 --> 02:53:17.278]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[02:53:17.398 --> 02:53:19.579]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[02:53:19.759 --> 02:53:23.241]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?

[02:53:49.633 --> 02:53:50.033]  We're good to go.
[02:54:15.763 --> 02:54:17.144]  Dr. Group is just blowing me away.
[02:54:17.184 --> 02:54:28.191]  I mean, I know the basics of all this, but I don't have time to sit here and read 50 pages of the company's own announcements, how they've imported these mosquitoes all over the world to the places where Zika is popping up.
[02:54:29.932 --> 02:54:34.395]  And the OX513A has a regulatory approval for import.
[02:54:35.484 --> 02:54:40.988]  And testing, and contained testing in Brazil, Cayman Islands, France, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, U.S.
[02:54:41.348 --> 02:54:41.948]  and Vietnam.
[02:54:42.108 --> 02:54:47.852]  Open field trials have taken place in both Grand Cayman and Malaysia and are currently also underway in Brazil.
[02:54:48.973 --> 02:54:49.453]  Right there.
[02:54:50.894 --> 02:54:53.215]  So they released the mosquitoes and now Zika pops up.
[02:54:53.235 --> 02:54:56.297]  They're mosquitoes with Zika that are supposedly to fix Zika.
[02:54:56.998 --> 02:55:03.122]  But Bill Gates, the guy that wants to get rid of us, notice in the TED Talk he's like, we will reduce population by giving you better medical care.
[02:55:04.451 --> 02:55:09.199]  In fact, we have the full clip now, or the other part we didn't play, from the TED Talk.
[02:55:09.219 --> 02:55:09.579]  Here it is.
[02:55:10.623 --> 02:55:13.625]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero.
[02:55:14.426 --> 02:55:27.836]  And that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[02:55:28.316 --> 02:55:33.000]  So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:36.783]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[02:55:37.754 --> 02:55:41.536]  Now that's back from high school algebra, but let's take a look.
[02:55:42.596 --> 02:55:44.077]  First we've got population.
[02:55:44.838 --> 02:55:47.099]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[02:55:47.579 --> 02:55:49.180]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[02:55:49.780 --> 02:55:58.905]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[02:55:59.425 --> 02:56:02.146]  But there we see an increase of about 1.3.
[02:56:04.364 --> 02:56:12.167]  I'm going to make a whole thing on this, because this is a weird wormhole of these Gates quotes over the years here, and everybody's doing a great job, but this didn't do preparation before.
[02:56:12.807 --> 02:56:15.128]  He then goes on to say we're going to reduce this to zero, and everybody laughs.
[02:56:15.168 --> 02:56:16.649]  So tonight on the news, we're going to have that.
[02:56:16.669 --> 02:56:22.171]  I'm going to shoot a special report on that if hell doesn't rain down from heaven.
[02:56:22.931 --> 02:56:30.934]  Now, continuing here, Dr. Group, how do we reach out to people to get them to become aware that all of this is going on?
[02:56:33.069 --> 02:56:47.735]  Well, I think the best way, I mean, all you're getting from the mainstream media is obviously not the truth, and I think with anything that could possibly threaten you or your children, you need to take it upon yourself.
[02:56:47.815 --> 02:56:51.277]  I mean, obviously watch your show, do some research, type in
[02:56:51.997 --> 02:56:56.181]  Zika virus, type in... I mean, you can trace it back just like I did.
[02:56:56.221 --> 02:56:59.003]  I mean, you can go to the Oxitec website and read all about it.
[02:56:59.043 --> 02:57:00.424]  It's not... It's right out in the open.
[02:57:00.444 --> 02:57:00.844]  It's ridiculous!
[02:57:00.924 --> 02:57:10.953]  I mean, why is no one saying they released genetically modified mosquitoes that all the top experts warned about that supposedly kills Zika, and now it's got... and now it's mutated and is worse?
[02:57:11.473 --> 02:57:13.915]  I mean, the thing is, the research is out there.
[02:57:13.995 --> 02:57:15.697]  It's just, what is the...
[02:57:17.199 --> 02:57:18.560]  What are they trying to accomplish here?
[02:57:18.580 --> 02:57:37.669]  I mean, obviously accomplish vaccinations, obviously accomplish fear, but I would say that just be aware and know what you need to do, how you can protect yourself, how can you keep your immune system strong, have antiviral or at least immune-boosting herbs ready.
[02:57:37.689 --> 02:57:40.790]  And just know that whatever hysteria they drive isn't what keeps you safe.
[02:57:40.850 --> 02:57:41.331]  It's like the
[02:57:42.211 --> 02:57:46.053]  H1N1 flu bug six years ago that they said take the shot it protects you.
[02:57:46.313 --> 02:57:51.716]  Turns out that was a simulant in vaccines the year before getting on the company's own website again.
[02:57:51.736 --> 02:57:52.616]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:57:52.976 --> 02:57:59.860]  They released a simulant that wasn't even making people sick that then lowered your immunity to other flus to then kill people.
[02:58:01.052 --> 02:58:23.582]  Well, just think, if you had a genetically modified mosquito with, who knows if the Zika virus, how many modifications have been done to that, to the RNA, and you have mosquitoes going around, and there's other viruses in people's blood, and you have a mosquito that goes into one person and injects this, and it's a genetically modified cells from the genetically modified mosquito,
[02:58:24.182 --> 02:58:29.703]  Going into you and mixing with other potential viruses in your blood or in the air or in animals.
[02:58:29.743 --> 02:58:30.203]  Incredible.
[02:58:30.383 --> 02:58:30.783]  Incredible.
[02:58:30.803 --> 02:58:33.784]  Dr. Drew, I'm going to come back with a Joe Biggs report.
[02:58:34.124 --> 02:58:38.085]  Going out to break, I'm going to play a short segment from it where he talks to these women.
[02:58:38.125 --> 02:58:39.945]  They say they're voting for Hillary for girl power.
[02:58:40.225 --> 02:58:41.205]  Let's go out to break with that.
[02:58:41.225 --> 02:58:44.606]  Uh, well, you know, why am I voting for you?
[02:58:44.946 --> 02:58:45.186]  Yeah.
[02:58:45.286 --> 02:58:45.806]  Girl power.
[02:58:46.587 --> 02:58:47.007]  That's it?
[02:58:47.727 --> 02:58:48.147]  That's it.
[02:58:48.187 --> 02:58:48.647]  We'll be back.
[02:58:51.653 --> 02:58:55.650]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[03:00:20.729 --> 03:00:21.950]  He's got a big show lined up.
[03:00:22.410 --> 03:00:25.091]  The feds are mashing outside the Oregon Refuge.
[03:00:25.111 --> 03:00:26.552]  Looks like something huge could happen there.
[03:00:26.572 --> 03:00:29.353]  We'll have local rancher Tom Davis and local reporter
[03:00:30.193 --> 03:00:35.215]  Michael Emery on, and he's got Ron Paul trying to stop the arming of BLM.
[03:00:35.875 --> 03:00:40.617]  He's got a bunch of articles on the Iowa aftermath, dirty money, trying to ban money.
[03:00:41.317 --> 03:00:46.059]  Women use the force in Europe to battle radical Islamists.
[03:00:46.079 --> 03:00:47.159]  So you've heard in the U.S.
[03:00:47.179 --> 03:00:48.180]  they tell women to urinate.
[03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:50.060]  What difference at this point does it make
[03:01:19.198 --> 03:01:21.439]  We came, we saw, he died.
[03:01:21.639 --> 03:01:27.221]  A dead heat for all practical purposes, almost from the start to the finish.
[03:01:27.401 --> 03:01:29.661]  Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders is in a dead heat.
[03:01:29.981 --> 03:01:34.143]  Did you know she won one of the little areas based on a coin toss?
[03:01:34.463 --> 03:01:38.104]  At least six precincts resorted to a coin flip due to a tie.
[03:01:46.449 --> 03:01:47.772]  Sorry, it just keeps happening.
[03:01:52.661 --> 03:01:54.042]  I swear to God, my health is fine.
[03:01:54.062 --> 03:01:58.605]  This is Hillary Clinton reporting for InfoWars.com in downtown Austin, Texas.
[03:01:58.925 --> 03:02:05.230]  Now I am tired, I'm very tired, because I was just in Iowa last night where I beat Bernie Sanders in the Iowa caucus.
[03:02:05.730 --> 03:02:11.874]  Now you might ask yourself, how can more people show up to Bernie Sanders events and less show up to mine and I still win?
[03:02:12.135 --> 03:02:12.775]  Well guess what?
[03:02:13.195 --> 03:02:16.538]  I got that coin flip game going on right there, every time.
[03:02:16.558 --> 03:02:17.558]  Oop, again.
[03:02:18.039 --> 03:02:19.880]  Well it was actually tails, but I flipped it really quick.
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:21.841]  It's a sleight of hand trick.
[03:02:22.161 --> 03:02:23.421]  Us Clintons are really good at that.
[03:02:23.861 --> 03:02:25.722]  We learned how to gamble down in Arkansas.
[03:02:26.082 --> 03:02:35.364]  Well, we're going to go out here and talk to people and ask people if they like me or Bernie Sanders or if they find it suspicious that I'm really good at flipping coins.
[03:02:36.005 --> 03:02:37.105]  Hey, what's going on guys?
[03:02:37.165 --> 03:02:37.965]  It's Hillary Clinton.
[03:02:37.985 --> 03:02:38.985]  How are you doing?
[03:02:39.005 --> 03:02:39.626]  I'm kind of tired.
[03:02:39.646 --> 03:02:41.626]  I just got in from Iowa.
[03:02:41.946 --> 03:02:43.027]  Do you like Hillary Clinton?
[03:02:43.747 --> 03:02:43.987]  No.
[03:02:44.407 --> 03:02:45.347]  Well, why don't you like me?
[03:02:46.127 --> 03:02:47.028]  Because you're a liar?
[03:02:47.408 --> 03:02:47.868]  A cheater?
[03:02:49.029 --> 03:02:50.311]  Um, you're a mean lady.
[03:02:50.951 --> 03:02:52.313]  Have you seen the Benghazi movie?
[03:02:53.073 --> 03:02:53.294]  No.
[03:02:53.694 --> 03:02:54.235]  Yeah, me neither.
[03:02:54.275 --> 03:02:55.476]  I slept through it the first time.
[03:02:55.496 --> 03:02:56.617]  Alright, quick question.
[03:02:56.657 --> 03:02:58.119]  Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders?
[03:02:58.479 --> 03:02:58.919]  Hillary Clinton.
[03:02:58.939 --> 03:03:00.221]  So why are you voting for me?
[03:03:00.961 --> 03:03:01.782]  Oh, are you Hillary?
[03:03:01.862 --> 03:03:02.483]  Well, of course.
[03:03:02.503 --> 03:03:03.304]  You see my pants too?
[03:03:03.344 --> 03:03:03.904]  Come on.
[03:03:03.944 --> 03:03:04.985]  You look beautiful.
[03:03:05.246 --> 03:03:06.287]  Hillary Clinton, yes or no?
[03:03:19.676 --> 03:03:22.058]  You gonna vote for Hillary Clinton for me for president?
[03:03:22.158 --> 03:03:22.458]  No.
[03:03:22.738 --> 03:03:23.259]  Why not?
[03:03:23.939 --> 03:03:25.180]  I'm as honest as they come.
[03:03:26.101 --> 03:03:28.463]  Well, you know, why am I voting for you?
[03:03:28.843 --> 03:03:29.103]  Yeah.
[03:03:29.183 --> 03:03:29.764]  Girl power.
[03:03:30.484 --> 03:03:30.905]  That's it?
[03:03:32.266 --> 03:03:36.048]  Some people say that I'm gonna be a great person for females.
[03:03:36.068 --> 03:03:36.489]  What do you think?
[03:03:37.814 --> 03:03:41.236]  I don't know enough about Hillary to have an opinion, so... Really?
[03:03:41.256 --> 03:03:42.396]  You don't know anything about Hillary Clinton?
[03:03:42.696 --> 03:03:44.777]  Did you guys hear about what happened last night?
[03:03:45.077 --> 03:03:45.657]  No, no.
[03:03:46.218 --> 03:03:47.278]  Well, I beat Bernie!
[03:03:47.598 --> 03:03:47.878]  It's 50-50, no?
[03:03:47.938 --> 03:03:49.719]  What do you mean?
[03:03:49.739 --> 03:03:50.099]  Like this?
[03:03:50.279 --> 03:03:51.000]  With a coin toss?
[03:03:51.340 --> 03:03:53.461]  Did you see how I won last night at the Iowa caucus?
[03:03:54.621 --> 03:03:55.922]  I think you probably cheated.
[03:03:55.942 --> 03:03:57.182]  Well, how?
[03:03:57.202 --> 03:03:57.563]  With this?
[03:03:57.723 --> 03:03:59.103]  You think you can beat me at a coin toss?
[03:03:59.363 --> 03:04:01.664]  What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?
[03:04:03.145 --> 03:04:03.325]  Sir?
[03:04:03.785 --> 03:04:05.426]  The most you ever lost.
[03:04:07.225 --> 03:04:07.906]  Hey, what do you guys think?
[03:04:07.926 --> 03:04:09.407]  Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton?
[03:04:12.689 --> 03:04:13.330]  No, okay.
[03:04:13.410 --> 03:04:13.970]  Well, guess what?
[03:04:14.310 --> 03:04:15.551]  This is how we fix that tiebreaker.
[03:04:15.571 --> 03:04:17.113]  This is what they did last night in the Iowa caucus.
[03:04:17.133 --> 03:04:17.373]  You ready?
[03:04:17.593 --> 03:04:18.113]  Call it in the air.
[03:04:18.333 --> 03:04:19.214]  Best out of five.
[03:04:20.375 --> 03:04:21.256]  Oh, one for me.
[03:04:21.576 --> 03:04:22.056]  Call it in the air.
[03:04:23.878 --> 03:04:24.458]  Oh, there's one.
[03:04:27.881 --> 03:04:28.761]  Oh, there's two.
[03:04:30.683 --> 03:04:31.323]  Oh, tails.
[03:04:32.224 --> 03:04:32.804]  Oh, you got it.
[03:04:32.844 --> 03:04:33.865]  You're winning so far.
[03:04:34.045 --> 03:04:34.806]  Alright, one more.
[03:04:38.032 --> 03:04:38.252]  See?
[03:04:38.832 --> 03:04:39.653]  I didn't win again.
[03:04:39.973 --> 03:04:41.553]  Well, we both tied again.
[03:04:41.573 --> 03:04:44.794]  I guess I can't win at all.
[03:04:45.554 --> 03:04:45.994]  He won!
[03:04:46.495 --> 03:04:47.275]  Fair and square.
[03:04:47.635 --> 03:04:50.896]  Hillary Clinton loses in a coin toss with this guy.
[03:04:51.116 --> 03:04:52.216]  It's a little suspicious, huh?
[03:04:52.536 --> 03:04:54.457]  I would give this to you, but I'm not Bernie Sanders.
[03:04:55.157 --> 03:04:55.657]  What do you think?
[03:04:55.697 --> 03:04:57.858]  Hillary Clinton, me, or Bernie Sanders?
[03:04:58.558 --> 03:04:59.919]  Me or Bernie.
[03:04:59.939 --> 03:05:00.279]  Come on.
[03:05:01.259 --> 03:05:01.699]  Come on!
[03:05:02.119 --> 03:05:03.840]  Hey, are you guys going to vote for Hillary Clinton?
[03:05:05.400 --> 03:05:06.381]  I wouldn't vote for me either.
[03:05:06.401 --> 03:05:07.021]  I'm a lying ass.
[03:05:09.016 --> 03:05:11.318]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[03:05:11.458 --> 03:05:20.644]  Now I continue to see college kids all across the country going around protesting, saying that they demand $15 raise for minimum wage.
[03:05:20.944 --> 03:05:21.644]  And what did I say?
[03:05:21.984 --> 03:05:24.806]  Well, you're going to continue to do that, and guess what companies are going to do?
[03:05:25.006 --> 03:05:25.767]  They're going to fire you.
[03:05:26.027 --> 03:05:34.374]  And hire a robot, then they don't have to pay anybody, and that robot can quadruple their work, do it for 24 hours straight, they don't need a lunch break, they don't need anything like that.
[03:05:34.614 --> 03:05:35.355]  And well, guess what?
[03:05:35.415 --> 03:05:36.055]  It's finally here.
[03:05:36.216 --> 03:05:41.960]  Article by Tech Insider, these four foot tall robots could change the way warehouse workers do their job.
[03:05:42.020 --> 03:05:46.844]  And it's not just gonna be warehouse workers, it's gonna be the people at Burger King, at McDonald's, all over the place.
[03:05:46.904 --> 03:05:51.208]  The Locust Robot can zip around a clothing warehouse larger than the size of six football fields,
[03:05:51.348 --> 03:05:55.790]  It can also work for 24 hours without a break for lunch or a salary.
[03:05:55.890 --> 03:06:03.714]  The new bot created by Locus Robotics just launched in its first warehouse, a Devins, Massachusetts based owned by Quiet Logistics.

[03:08:20.934 --> 03:08:28.163]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:28.663 --> 03:08:29.965]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:29.985 --> 03:08:32.868]  I'm David Knight in this fourth hour of the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[03:08:32.888 --> 03:08:35.351]  At the bottom of the hour, we're going to be talking to...
[03:08:36.471 --> 03:08:43.437]  A rancher, as well as a local reporter, back in the Oregon area, back in Burns, Oregon, where the standoff was occurring.
[03:08:44.017 --> 03:08:47.300]  We're trying to reach out to people that are there.
[03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:52.283]  They contacted us, actually, yesterday, saying that they fear that an escalation is coming.
[03:08:52.324 --> 03:08:56.547]  The same type of thing that we heard from LaVoy Finicum the day before he was killed.
[03:08:56.587 --> 03:08:59.029]  He had an interview with the Oregon newspaper.
[03:08:59.549 --> 03:09:02.810]  He said, I don't understand why there's been the change in tenor.
[03:09:02.850 --> 03:09:04.810]  He asked the reporter, haven't you noticed this as well?
[03:09:04.830 --> 03:09:09.471]  We used to be able to get out and have a friendly conversation with the agents who are around here.
[03:09:09.511 --> 03:09:11.592]  Now they get out of their car with guns drawn.
[03:09:11.612 --> 03:09:14.232]  They're very hard attitude towards us.
[03:09:14.272 --> 03:09:16.913]  There's a buildup of troops and equipment.
[03:09:16.953 --> 03:09:20.674]  We have constant flyovers and drones watching us.
[03:09:20.734 --> 03:09:22.614]  The next day, he was shot and killed.
[03:09:22.674 --> 03:09:25.295]  Many people say that he was shot and killed with his hands up.
[03:09:26.215 --> 03:09:38.328]  The video that was released by the FBI, very low-res aerial video without any footage is very inconclusive and it is contradicted by the statements of two eyewitnesses who were in the car.
[03:09:38.388 --> 03:09:39.870]  We talked about that a bit yesterday.
[03:09:39.910 --> 03:09:42.613]  We're going to talk to these people who are on the ground.
[03:09:43.033 --> 03:09:47.999]  They called me and told me that what they're experiencing on their own private property
[03:09:48.559 --> 03:09:58.385]  It's far worse than what the rancher Kurt Spencer told us as we showed you that report earlier as he was talking about having to go through checkpoints.
[03:09:58.545 --> 03:10:01.667]  He said he'd never had a gun pointed at him in his life before.
[03:10:01.727 --> 03:10:07.710]  He talked about how he had been in Africa and there were checkpoints there that were very worrisome.
[03:10:07.750 --> 03:10:10.512]  You didn't know if you were going to go get through those checkpoints nevertheless.
[03:10:11.112 --> 03:10:16.336]  The armed militarized checkpoints in Africa, even there, they didn't point a gun at him.
[03:10:16.356 --> 03:10:23.802]  But we were told by the ranchers and others that we talked to that they're now going on private property, these ranchers, threatening them, pointing guns at them.
[03:10:23.822 --> 03:10:25.904]  So we're going to have that at the bottom of the hour.
[03:10:26.364 --> 03:10:35.692]  We also have a clip from Ron Paul, 20 years ago, where he asks, why is the BLM and other federal agencies, why are they being armed?
[03:10:36.451 --> 03:10:37.292]  What is going on here?
[03:10:37.312 --> 03:10:40.574]  And that was 20 years ago, 1997, actually 19 years ago.
[03:10:41.315 --> 03:10:42.976]  Today I saw this article.
[03:10:42.996 --> 03:10:47.380]  I want to put this in as context before we get to the Ron Paul article.
[03:10:48.240 --> 03:10:49.161]  This is from Politico.
[03:10:49.261 --> 03:10:51.503]  Meet your unauthorized federal government.
[03:10:52.295 --> 03:10:52.795]  Very interesting.
[03:10:52.815 --> 03:10:56.258]  What they're talking about here, and this is their terms, a zombie bureaucracy.
[03:10:56.839 --> 03:11:00.762]  I would say what we're looking at is a zombie bureaucracy apocalypse.
[03:11:01.342 --> 03:11:06.887]  They point out the FBI, the DEA, the BATF have not been reauthorized by Congress since 2009.
[03:11:08.348 --> 03:11:10.430]  The State Department hasn't been reauthorized since 2003.
[03:11:10.530 --> 03:11:18.396]  The FTC, the National Weather Service, 1998 for the FTC, 1993 for the Weather Service.
[03:11:18.436 --> 03:11:23.019]  The Federal Election Commission has been operating with an expired authorization since 1981.
[03:11:24.220 --> 03:11:24.980]  So what's going on?
[03:11:25.581 --> 03:11:26.602]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[03:11:27.560 --> 03:11:32.244]  As I point out, every federal agency is supposed to operate under congressional authorization.
[03:11:32.605 --> 03:11:36.388]  They give them a set of rules, they set the priorities, they set the activities for the government.
[03:11:36.728 --> 03:11:49.339]  That is supposed to have a sunset clause on it, so that when they expire, it gives them a chance to reconsider what the agency's mission is, to see whether they need to modernize it, whether they need to impose some controls because it's out of control.
[03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:53.661]  But now it's turned into a zombie government.
[03:11:54.062 --> 03:11:57.003]  You see, the Congress no longer writes the laws.
[03:11:57.083 --> 03:11:58.523]  And we've talked about this many times.
[03:11:58.804 --> 03:12:01.345]  They've abdicated that responsibility to the bureaucracies.
[03:12:01.385 --> 03:12:03.906]  The bureaucracies wrote 81,000 pages of federal rules last year.
[03:12:07.307 --> 03:12:09.949]  The Congress just creates these and then lets them go.
[03:12:09.989 --> 03:12:13.672]  They don't even bother to reauthorize them, let alone write the laws.
[03:12:13.712 --> 03:12:20.677]  They don't even bother to reauthorize the agencies that they've abdicated their lawmaking functions to.
[03:12:21.178 --> 03:12:23.960]  So what we have here truly is a zombie bureaucracy.
[03:12:24.620 --> 03:12:29.624]  It is a living, dead bureaucracy that is preying on our people, eating out their substance.
[03:12:29.644 --> 03:12:31.465]  They point out how this is expanding.
[03:12:31.505 --> 03:12:41.673]  They say 20 years ago, and that's about the time this clip that we're going to be playing from Ron Paul, 20 years ago, it was only 10% of the discretionary spending of the government.
[03:12:41.713 --> 03:12:48.197]  And of course, understand discretionary spending is distinguished from the welfare entitlement program.
[03:12:48.237 --> 03:12:51.220]  So in other words, it's something that they have some direct control over.
[03:12:52.253 --> 03:12:57.500]  Only 10% 20 years ago consisted of unauthorized programs.
[03:12:57.840 --> 03:13:01.985]  Now it is well over a quarter of the programs meet that.
[03:13:02.025 --> 03:13:07.893]  Now they say Congress's failure to pass reauthorizations doesn't prevent government agencies from functioning.
[03:13:07.953 --> 03:13:10.676]  They can function as long as they get the money.
[03:13:11.297 --> 03:13:17.181]  You see, they keep giving them money, but they don't bother to pass the reauthorization.
[03:13:17.482 --> 03:13:17.842]  Why?
[03:13:18.442 --> 03:13:25.208]  Because our Congress, our government, is absolutely contemptuous of the rules.
[03:13:25.748 --> 03:13:26.889]  They don't follow any of the rules.
[03:13:26.929 --> 03:13:29.251]  They swear to the Constitution, but they don't follow any of the rules.
[03:13:29.431 --> 03:13:35.976]  We're going to have a signing tomorrow of the Trans-Pacific Partnership by Obama's representatives in New Zealand.
[03:13:36.576 --> 03:13:42.821]  They still say they have to ratify this, but of course, when you're talking about ratification, you're talking about a treaty, aren't you?
[03:13:43.421 --> 03:13:46.283]  There is a process in the Constitution for ratifying a treaty.
[03:13:46.604 --> 03:13:47.584]  They're ignoring that.
[03:13:47.825 --> 03:14:03.917]  All the people who voted for the fast-tracked trade promotion, TPA, the Trade Promotion Authorization, that's to fast-track this, all the people who voted for that said, we don't care about the constitutional process where we need two-thirds of the Senate to ratify a treaty.
[03:14:04.577 --> 03:14:05.538]  We're going to ignore that.
[03:14:05.678 --> 03:14:10.821]  We're going to say a simple majority of the Senate and the House, and we're not going to have any amendments allowed.
[03:14:11.081 --> 03:14:13.342]  We're not going to have any debate, no filibuster.
[03:14:13.542 --> 03:14:17.204]  It's got to be done within 20 hours of it being put to the floor.
[03:14:17.364 --> 03:14:26.310]  And once it's brought to the floor by leadership, you can't have any committee obfuscation of that, the typical process that would be there for a bill becoming a law.
[03:14:26.330 --> 03:14:27.750]  We're going to ignore all of that.
[03:14:27.991 --> 03:14:31.553]  We're going to ignore the process for ratifying a treaty, and we're just going to run this through.
[03:14:32.153 --> 03:14:34.393]  So we see this happening over and over again.
[03:14:35.034 --> 03:14:40.755]  But as I've pointed out, these bureaucracies, each of them, have become their own little fiefdom, their own little government.
[03:14:40.815 --> 03:14:58.059]  Not only do they write the laws with the approval of the Congress, the tacit approval, the abdication, I would say, allowing them to usurp this power, taxing us without representation, legislating without representation, they also have their own little armies.
[03:14:58.099 --> 03:14:59.939]  And this is what Ron Paul said 20 years ago.
[03:15:01.843 --> 03:15:11.267]  Earlier this year, another member severely criticized me on the House floor for declaring on C-SPAN that, indeed, many Americans justifiably feared their own government.
[03:15:11.927 --> 03:15:19.650]  This fear has come from the police state mentality that prompted Ruby Ridge, Waco, and many other episodes of an errant federal government.
[03:15:20.470 --> 03:15:23.851]  Under the Constitution, there was never meant to be a federal police force.
[03:15:24.491 --> 03:15:29.313]  Even an FBI limited only to investigations was not accepted until this century.
[03:15:29.813 --> 03:15:45.398]  Yet today, fueled by the federal government's misdirected war on drugs, radical environmentalism, and the aggressive behavior of the nanny state, we have witnessed the massive buildup of a virtual army of armed regulators prowling the states where they have no legal authority.
[03:15:46.579 --> 03:15:57.531]  The sacrifice of individual responsibility and the concept of local government by the majority of American citizens has permitted the army of bureaucrats to thrive.
[03:15:58.352 --> 03:16:05.100]  We have depended on government for so much for so long that we as a people have become less vigilant of our liberties.
[03:16:05.961 --> 03:16:06.762]  And more immediate,
[03:16:07.202 --> 03:16:11.966]  The enforcement of the interventionist state requires a growing army of bureaucrats.
[03:16:12.567 --> 03:16:26.859]  Since groups demanding special favors from the federal government must abuse the rights and property of those who produce wealth and cherish liberty, real resentment is directed at the agents who come to eat out our substance.
[03:16:27.619 --> 03:16:34.765]  The natural consequence is for the intruders to arm themselves to protect against angry victims of government intrusion.
[03:16:35.746 --> 03:16:42.353]  Thanks to a recent article by Joseph Farah, director of the Western Journalism Center of Sacramento, California.
[03:16:42.874 --> 03:16:45.457]  In 1996 alone, at least 2,439 new federal cops were authorized to carry firearms.
[03:16:52.324 --> 03:16:54.164]  That takes the total up to nearly 60,000.
[03:16:55.865 --> 03:17:03.527]  Farah points out that these cops were not only in agencies like the FBI, but include the EPA, the U.S.
[03:17:03.567 --> 03:17:06.568]  Fish and Wildlife, the Army Corps of Engineers.
[03:17:07.368 --> 03:17:12.669]  Even Bruce Babbitt, according to Farah, wants to arm the Bureau of Land Management.
[03:17:12.969 --> 03:17:14.750]  Farah logically asks,
[03:17:15.774 --> 03:17:19.698]  When will the NEA have its armed art cops?
[03:17:20.399 --> 03:17:21.960]  This is a dangerous trend.
[03:17:22.641 --> 03:17:33.832]  It's ironic that the proliferation of guns in the hands of the bureaucrats is pushed by the anti-gun fanatics who hate the Second Amendment and would disarm every law-abiding American citizen.
[03:17:34.352 --> 03:17:35.934]  Yes, we need gun control.
[03:17:35.954 --> 03:17:39.777]  We need to disarm our bureaucrats, then abolish the agencies.
[03:17:41.109 --> 03:17:41.829]  Isn't that true?
[03:17:42.150 --> 03:17:43.610]  Isn't that what we've seen in Oregon?
[03:17:43.910 --> 03:17:58.517]  We've seen people like the governor there, Kate Brown, people who hate the Second Amendment pushing for the government to use arms against the people to protect the government agents as they come in and intrude on the freedoms of the people in these areas.
[03:17:58.538 --> 03:18:03.040]  So we're going to have an interview at the bottom of the hour with people who are now saying that
[03:18:03.780 --> 03:18:09.685]  The BLM is stepping up their operations against the people, the ranchers, on their private property.
[03:18:09.885 --> 03:18:11.046]  This is a massive build-up.
[03:18:11.066 --> 03:18:18.652]  This is far beyond four guys and a little remote wildlife refuge, which is there for bird watching in the middle of the winter, okay?
[03:18:18.692 --> 03:18:21.915]  This is not an emergency that we have to shut this down.
[03:18:21.955 --> 03:18:26.579]  But of course, the governor there made it an emergency, said that she wanted this to happen.
[03:18:26.699 --> 03:18:27.680]  And we have now had
[03:18:28.280 --> 03:18:44.519]  Both senators from Oregon, Ron Wyden is one of them, and we've had several congressmen, Democrat congressmen, all foes of the Second Amendment, saying that they need to not only teach these people a lesson, but they need to teach the people in Nevada that were at Bunkerville a lesson.
[03:18:44.619 --> 03:18:47.002]  That's what this has all been about from the very beginning.
[03:18:47.422 --> 03:18:48.424]  We can see this happening.
[03:18:48.784 --> 03:18:49.445]  I talked about it.
[03:18:49.485 --> 03:18:50.586]  Alex Jones talked about it.
[03:18:50.626 --> 03:18:52.268]  We said they're being set up.
[03:18:52.629 --> 03:18:53.830]  This is an act of revenge.
[03:18:53.870 --> 03:18:55.192]  But now it is getting beyond that.
[03:18:55.632 --> 03:18:58.956]  It is going to the ranchers and the other area because they understand
[03:18:59.656 --> 03:19:00.597]  What is going on?
[03:19:00.657 --> 03:19:01.777]  What the government is doing?
[03:19:01.817 --> 03:19:02.978]  What the endgame is?
[03:19:03.018 --> 03:19:04.179]  What Agenda 21?
[03:19:04.739 --> 03:19:06.560]  And that's what we're going to be talking to the ranchers about.
[03:19:06.600 --> 03:19:13.785]  Now, we look at the government that is out of control, this unauthorized, zombie government, as Politico called them.
[03:19:13.825 --> 03:19:15.126]  That's their term, not mine.
[03:19:15.566 --> 03:19:16.647]  They're a zombie government.
[03:19:17.047 --> 03:19:20.289]  I'm just saying it's a zombie bureaucracy apocalypse.
[03:19:20.329 --> 03:19:22.091]  That's the apocalypse part I see happening.
[03:19:22.331 --> 03:19:29.176]  But of course, as I mentioned, we've got all these agencies that don't even bother to follow the law to reauthorize them.
[03:19:29.216 --> 03:19:30.677]  They just let them write the rules.
[03:19:30.717 --> 03:19:31.337]  They arm them.
[03:19:31.837 --> 03:19:33.499]  Remember, it was a few years ago.
[03:19:34.434 --> 03:19:42.341]  We had a situation where, and in this article Ron Paul was saying 20 years ago, when are they going to arm the NEA, the National Endowment for the Arts?
[03:19:42.361 --> 03:19:45.143]  Well, they armed the education bureaucracy.
[03:19:45.644 --> 03:19:57.494]  They had them perform a SWAT team arrest on a family at O-Dark 30, dragging the family out, putting them on their face, guns drawn to their head because they're looking for the mother who no longer lived there that was behind on her student loans.
[03:19:57.894 --> 03:20:07.164]  A year earlier, the Washington Post had said, why is the Department of Education putting out RFPs for shotguns, for bulletproof vests, for SWAT equipment?
[03:20:07.464 --> 03:20:07.925]  That's why.
[03:20:08.205 --> 03:20:09.186]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:20:09.246 --> 03:20:13.831]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, a crashing economy.
[03:20:14.051 --> 03:20:14.932]  Are you ready?
[03:20:15.152 --> 03:20:17.835]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[03:20:17.915 --> 03:20:20.057]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[03:20:20.257 --> 03:20:23.741]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety that it'll never happen to you?
[03:20:24.041 --> 03:20:28.827]  Be wise and be ready with 25-Year Shelf Life Wise Food Storage.

[03:24:21.448 --> 03:24:22.729]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:22.769 --> 03:24:23.349]  I'm David Knight.
[03:24:23.369 --> 03:24:31.515]  We're going to be talking to some people on the ground in Oregon, ranchers who are saying that it's not just martial law roadblocks that are being put up by the federal government.
[03:24:31.535 --> 03:24:39.720]  They're actually coming on to private property and intimidating, pointing guns at people who are ranchers there, coming on to their own personal property.
[03:24:39.740 --> 03:24:41.381]  So we're going to be talking to them in the next segment.
[03:24:41.762 --> 03:24:43.623]  Before we do, I want to cover some political news.
[03:24:44.103 --> 03:24:49.066]  And before we get to that, I just want to let you know that we've now introduced a new product, Anthroplex.
[03:24:49.567 --> 03:24:51.008]  This is a twice daily pill.
[03:24:51.528 --> 03:24:57.050]  It's a formulation for men, a perfect pairing to Super Male Vitality, which of course is in liquid form.
[03:24:57.070 --> 03:24:59.291]  This is a twice daily pill formulation.
[03:24:59.651 --> 03:25:07.335]  It synergistically works with Super Male Vitality using key ingredients you've been asking for in a newly balanced blend of other organic herbs.
[03:25:07.455 --> 03:25:15.898]  And for a limited time, when you buy the synergistic duo of Anthroplex and Super Male Vitality together at InfoWarsLife.com, you'll get 15% off and free shipping.
[03:25:18.419 --> 03:25:24.706]  And I would remind you as well that we still have the special of free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[03:25:24.766 --> 03:25:27.169]  Again, that's at Infowarslife.com.
[03:25:27.209 --> 03:25:33.095]  The new special with a 15% off our new product, Anthroplex, bought with Supermail Vitality.
[03:25:33.115 --> 03:25:34.837]  You get 15% off and free shipping.
[03:25:34.997 --> 03:25:37.920]  And there's also free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[03:25:39.980 --> 03:25:48.526]  Now as we were just talking in the last segment about the story that was on Politico, talking about how the government doesn't even bother to reauthorize these massive federal agencies.
[03:25:48.626 --> 03:25:52.810]  Over a quarter of the agencies are not authorized anymore.
[03:25:53.230 --> 03:25:55.972]  Just operating without any authorization from Congress.
[03:25:56.092 --> 03:26:06.500]  And the Congress allows them to write the laws, allows them to become armed bureaucracies coming after people, and in many cases they have their own little courts where they accuse you.
[03:26:06.560 --> 03:26:11.024]  You don't have the right to a due process described in the Constitution.
[03:26:11.404 --> 03:26:17.910]  We truly do have a lawless government, and we have a political candidate, Hillary Clinton,
[03:26:18.590 --> 03:26:21.312]  Who is our lawless candidate for president?
[03:26:21.612 --> 03:26:27.196]  She says here, cyber security and one of the most ironic articles I've seen yet.
[03:26:27.857 --> 03:26:32.881]  Clinton says cyber security is one of our most important challenges for the next president.
[03:26:33.121 --> 03:26:40.867]  No, Hillary, it's the most important challenge for you to become president because you have ignored cyber security and yet you use this.
[03:26:41.874 --> 03:26:42.214]  I don't
[03:27:01.917 --> 03:27:11.124]  We first have to figure out how to create what would be an understanding with these nations that we will not tolerate their cyber theft, their cyber evasiveness.
[03:27:11.364 --> 03:27:16.168]  We certainly would never ever sit still for a cyber attack.
[03:27:16.268 --> 03:27:17.029]  You tell them, Hillary.
[03:27:17.489 --> 03:27:24.454]  Because, you know, just tell them, I don't ever want to see you peeking at my private unsecured server again.
[03:27:24.855 --> 03:27:25.976]  Don't ever look at that again.
[03:27:26.716 --> 03:27:30.299]  You nasty, peeping Toms all over the world.
[03:27:30.739 --> 03:27:34.022]  Everybody is looking at the Secretary of State's information, okay?
[03:27:34.062 --> 03:27:47.053]  It's one of the highest value targets, and yet she puts all this stuff on a private server that has absolutely no protection, and then has the audacity to say that cyber security is our most important challenge.
[03:27:47.093 --> 03:27:52.958]  Yes, it's a challenge when you've got people at the top who don't care about security, who don't care about top secret.
[03:27:53.698 --> 03:27:56.482]  Telling their subordinates to, well, okay, send that over to me.
[03:27:56.843 --> 03:27:58.225]  We can't do it because it's top secret.
[03:27:58.245 --> 03:27:59.226]  Just take that off.
[03:27:59.287 --> 03:28:01.850]  Take that off and fax it over to me or whatever.
[03:28:01.931 --> 03:28:02.551]  Email it to me.
[03:28:03.072 --> 03:28:08.180]  And again, this is on a day where we now have seven additional Clinton emails to be marked top secret.
[03:28:08.500 --> 03:28:09.121]  Every day.
[03:28:09.662 --> 03:28:14.186]  There are more that come out that are top secret or even above top secret.
[03:28:14.306 --> 03:28:22.013]  It's absolutely amazing, the hypocrisy, the cynicism, and I guess you could say the irony involved in all of this.
[03:28:22.113 --> 03:28:23.354]  It's absolutely insane.
[03:28:23.394 --> 03:28:34.443]  Meanwhile, we see Trump saying that he will probably sue over the results of the Iowa caucus, talking about how what Ted Cruz did to Ben Carson was truly voter fraud.
[03:28:34.523 --> 03:28:34.884]  I agree.
[03:28:35.515 --> 03:28:37.817]  I think that is a kind of voter fraud.
[03:28:38.537 --> 03:28:51.526]  As the caucuses were starting, right at 7 o'clock, the Ted Cruz campaign and of course their surrogate, Steve King there, who made accusations without backing them up, saying that Trump had bought off Sarah Palin.
[03:28:51.546 --> 03:28:53.467]  He said, show me the evidence, and he doesn't do it.
[03:28:53.487 --> 03:28:58.670]  Well, that same guy, Steve King, also tweets out and says, hey, Ben Carson's getting out of the race.
[03:28:58.711 --> 03:29:01.953]  You need to know and you need to tell everybody in your caucus.
[03:29:01.993 --> 03:29:05.215]  And of course, it's a very different situation in a caucus than it is in a polling.
[03:29:05.455 --> 03:29:05.735]  That's right.
[03:29:23.030 --> 03:29:24.291]  So it's a very different situation.
[03:29:24.351 --> 03:29:34.838]  If you go in there and are telling everybody falsely that Ben Carson is going to be dropping out and doing it as Stephen King did, even after they were told, that I think truly is voter fraud.
[03:29:34.878 --> 03:29:40.422]  And Ben Carson is saying, hey, as Christians we accept other people's apologies, but we also have to ask ourselves,
[03:29:40.962 --> 03:29:44.645]  Is this acceptable to us, the American people, or should there be some accountability?
[03:29:44.985 --> 03:29:47.267]  He said there should be consequences for some of these things.
[03:29:47.487 --> 03:29:49.348]  You don't just say, okay, let's move on.
[03:29:49.628 --> 03:29:51.810]  He says the damage was done to me, to Ben Carson.
[03:29:51.830 --> 03:29:53.151]  It wasn't done to Cruz.
[03:29:53.231 --> 03:29:58.014]  And as Trump points out, he says, this is total voter fraud.
[03:29:58.134 --> 03:29:59.255]  Misleading people of the polls.
[03:29:59.275 --> 03:29:59.855]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:59.875 --> 03:30:01.396]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.317 --> 03:30:05.019]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.048 --> 03:30:13.551]  Sometimes when people are offended, they want to some... You can just come in and say, stop that!
[03:30:13.732 --> 03:30:15.893]  Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
[03:30:16.053 --> 03:30:20.557]  If you start saying, we mustn't criticize or offend them, then humor's gone.
[03:30:20.917 --> 03:30:22.818]  With humor goes a sense of proportion.
[03:30:23.219 --> 03:30:25.400]  And then as far as I'm concerned, you're living in 1984.
[03:30:26.601 --> 03:30:28.804]  That was John Cleese of Monty Python.
[03:30:29.104 --> 03:30:32.508]  Political correctness is not a case of people who are well-meaning but neurotic.
[03:30:32.708 --> 03:30:36.593]  Not even spoiled and tolerant brats screaming at you with their hands over their ears.
[03:30:36.873 --> 03:30:39.216]  It's a weaponized tool of social control.
[03:30:39.436 --> 03:30:41.459]  You're accused of heresy on three counts.
[03:30:41.759 --> 03:30:44.462]  Heresy by thought, heresy by word, heresy by deeds, and heresy by action.
[03:30:44.502 --> 03:30:45.263]  Four counts.
[03:30:46.204 --> 03:30:50.285]  We should recognize the source where these weapons of social control are forged.
[03:30:50.705 --> 03:30:51.585]  The universities.
[03:30:52.006 --> 03:30:57.107]  Colleges are increasingly irrelevant to education, but essential to indoctrination.
[03:30:57.367 --> 03:31:05.429]  This is why Bernie and Hillary are so eager to extend kindergarten social control for free until people reach their mid-twenties or beyond.
[03:31:06.009 --> 03:31:08.010]  For Prison Planet TV, I'm David Knight.
[03:31:08.891 --> 03:31:10.272]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:31:10.532 --> 03:31:11.832]  You can't survive without it.
[03:31:12.032 --> 03:31:12.933]  But where do you get it?
[03:31:13.233 --> 03:31:18.995]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand-new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:31:19.215 --> 03:31:24.957]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:31:25.117 --> 03:31:32.860]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities.
[03:31:35.661 --> 03:31:41.984]  Including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[03:31:44.866 --> 03:31:46.066]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:31:46.346 --> 03:31:47.107]  Easy assembly.
[03:31:47.387 --> 03:31:47.987]  Low maintenance.
[03:31:48.287 --> 03:31:50.128]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:32:05.578 --> 03:32:05.938]  Hey everyone!
[03:32:09.440 --> 03:32:15.305]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:32:15.565 --> 03:32:17.167]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:32:17.647 --> 03:32:27.555]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:32:27.936 --> 03:32:33.921]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:32:34.381 --> 03:32:49.292]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[03:32:49.332 --> 03:32:49.732]  I think so.
[03:33:18.085 --> 03:33:22.134]  Another time, in the age of wonder.
[03:33:37.434 --> 03:33:41.378]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:42.079 --> 03:33:48.105]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:50.788 --> 03:33:52.149]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:52.229 --> 03:33:52.910]  I'm David Knight.
[03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:57.873]  In this segment we have a couple of people calling us from the Oregon standoff.
[03:33:58.013 --> 03:34:03.577]  I was there last week along with Joe Biggs following the shooting of LaVoy Finicum.
[03:34:03.977 --> 03:34:05.859]  I had them contact me yesterday.
[03:34:05.899 --> 03:34:13.064]  This is Tom Davis, a local rancher, as well as Michael Emery, who's with the Voice of Idaho News, a local news organization.
[03:34:13.864 --> 03:34:16.946]  They called me with some very troubling information of course.
[03:34:16.986 --> 03:34:20.448]  You've possibly seen the video that we have on Infowars.com.
[03:34:20.929 --> 03:34:27.693]  The rancher who was going through the checkpoint as we were on the radio program with Alex doing a live broadcast.
[03:34:28.153 --> 03:34:33.757]  I had talked to Alex and Joe Biggs was talking to him and at that point a rancher came through the checkpoint
[03:34:34.457 --> 03:34:41.359]  And we went over and started asking him questions about what it was like to go through that checkpoint, and he was absolutely amazed.
[03:34:41.419 --> 03:34:50.521]  The first time he said he had ever had guns pointed at him and his wife were going through the checkpoint, they shined lights on them, they told them to get out of the car, have their ID ready.
[03:34:50.861 --> 03:34:56.042]  He said they had snipers and other people pointing guns at them the entire time they checked their ID.
[03:34:56.082 --> 03:34:57.963]  He'd been in Africa, had never experienced that.
[03:34:58.723 --> 03:35:05.746]  But yesterday, Tom Davis, a local rancher, contacted me and said that there is more troubling stuff going on there now.
[03:35:05.806 --> 03:35:10.248]  So I wanted to talk to the two of them, get an update as to what is happening on the ground there.
[03:35:10.308 --> 03:35:14.010]  We're hearing that there is a buildup of federal forces in the area.
[03:35:14.310 --> 03:35:19.993]  Joining us now are Michael Emery of the Voice of Idaho News and Tom Davis, a local rancher.
[03:35:20.013 --> 03:35:22.534]  I believe Tom Davis is there at the microphone at the moment.
[03:35:22.574 --> 03:35:22.814]  Tom?
[03:35:24.294 --> 03:35:25.315]  Hi, how are y'all doing?
[03:35:25.899 --> 03:35:26.439]  Doing fine.
[03:35:27.040 --> 03:35:38.530]  Tell me and tell the audience what you were saying yesterday about what is going on on private property, because of course we're very troubled about the way they're treating local people going through these roadblocks, these checkpoints.
[03:35:38.550 --> 03:35:43.735]  Every time there's an incident, we see the government rush to create a kind of martial law scenario.
[03:35:44.035 --> 03:35:46.177]  But tell us what's going on on private property.
[03:35:46.197 --> 03:35:53.103]  Okay, down there on the Narrows, going down to Narrows, right by Pass Double O Road,
[03:35:53.752 --> 03:35:57.493]  They have a checkpoint set up where you gotta go through the checkpoint.
[03:35:58.233 --> 03:36:02.735]  One rancher and his daughters were going through the checkpoint, young girls, and they were stopped.
[03:36:03.175 --> 03:36:06.396]  And the government, with their weapons, was all ready to go.
[03:36:06.416 --> 03:36:13.998]  I told them to get out of their vehicles, searched them, searched their IDs, searched the young girls, which is inappropriate to begin with.
[03:36:14.018 --> 03:36:16.719]  This is America, we're not in communist Russia or anything.
[03:36:16.799 --> 03:36:17.199]  That's right.
[03:36:17.799 --> 03:36:20.240]  And they made them walk across the
[03:36:20.839 --> 03:36:28.586]  Took their vehicle, drove it down a ways and made them walk in the rain to the vehicle after they inspected them to make sure they were safe with guns pointed at them.
[03:36:29.286 --> 03:36:29.506]  Wow.
[03:36:30.147 --> 03:36:30.347]  Wow.
[03:36:30.647 --> 03:36:34.050]  So they drove, the federal agents drove the vehicle and took it down.
[03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:37.493]  Now you told me about another incident with a man who was taking video at some point.
[03:36:38.975 --> 03:36:43.959]  There was a gentleman taking videos at the rally up at the courthouse the other day, Monday.
[03:36:45.180 --> 03:36:47.602]  He was taking video and he was trying to get over at the
[03:36:48.137 --> 03:37:15.420]  compound of the occupiers of FBI and that and he walked over his video and one of those gentlemen with his M-16 pointed at him came up to him and told him to drop that dropping his cell phone and picture down stop on and destroy it the guy said no it's mine and he says well if you don't drop it and destroy it I will shove it up your and that and you won't have it and then he said I'll put a bullet for you
[03:37:16.294 --> 03:37:23.381]  The guy was scared and he backed up but still continued taking the picture and he backed off from that gentleman with his rifle.
[03:37:23.401 --> 03:37:24.261]  I don't know who he was.
[03:37:24.301 --> 03:37:25.943]  He said he was the FBI but I doubt it.
[03:37:27.845 --> 03:37:29.686]  It was kind of terrifying to him.
[03:37:29.726 --> 03:37:30.347]  He was shaking.
[03:37:30.367 --> 03:37:31.088]  He was so nervous.
[03:37:31.636 --> 03:37:33.017]  Well, you need to get that video to us.
[03:37:33.037 --> 03:37:35.158]  We'll put that up on our site if you can get that to us.
[03:37:35.799 --> 03:37:46.986]  You said when I talked to you yesterday that you and Michael Emery were both concerned that there is an escalation there that is not necessarily aimed at the four remaining people in that wildlife refuge.
[03:37:48.376 --> 03:37:49.617]  Yeah, there's constant build-up.
[03:37:49.677 --> 03:37:51.740]  We have Black Hawk helicopters showing up.
[03:37:52.240 --> 03:37:54.022]  We have Apache helicopters showing up.
[03:37:54.042 --> 03:37:54.963]  Those are war machines.
[03:37:54.983 --> 03:37:55.524]  They're for war.
[03:37:55.544 --> 03:37:57.386]  We have Emirates showing up.
[03:38:08.917 --> 03:38:21.281]  We've got four people, basically, these guys that don't seem to be much of a threat to anybody except themselves, out in a very remote location, and they bring in Apache helicopters.
[03:38:21.321 --> 03:38:22.481]  That's absolutely amazing.
[03:38:23.582 --> 03:38:29.403]  Yeah, they're friends of mine down there across the county line where they want to do the monument for in Mollier County.
[03:38:29.863 --> 03:38:31.984]  They want to steal 2.5 million acres.
[03:38:32.624 --> 03:38:35.625]  They've been seeing Blackhawks and Apaches circling
[03:38:36.277 --> 03:38:40.240]  Their ranch is constantly, every day, two to three of them circling the ranches.
[03:38:40.841 --> 03:38:42.162]  And they're starting to get scared.
[03:38:42.182 --> 03:38:43.783]  They're being intimidated.
[03:38:43.803 --> 03:38:49.408]  We have, you know, over in Crane, we have aircraft flying down the Crane Valley.
[03:38:49.428 --> 03:38:53.792]  And I don't know what those big aircrafts are doing flying over Crane, Oregon.
[03:38:53.852 --> 03:38:56.054]  And then they turn around and they come back across.
[03:38:56.815 --> 03:39:00.137]  If it's some type of surveillance plane, nobody knows.
[03:39:00.418 --> 03:39:03.881]  But it's just unusual for these big planes to be flying around in that area.
[03:39:05.302 --> 03:39:09.343]  Now you said that there was possibly an event that was going to be taking place tomorrow.
[03:39:09.363 --> 03:39:10.023]  Tell us about that.
[03:39:10.043 --> 03:39:17.626]  It's just a gathering of people and not to protest and the FBI.
[03:39:17.826 --> 03:39:19.826]  We're basically, go home, we don't need you here.
[03:39:19.867 --> 03:39:21.487]  We don't need all this military buildup.
[03:39:21.507 --> 03:39:22.847]  We don't need the MRAPs here.
[03:39:23.388 --> 03:39:24.748]  We don't need the snipers.
[03:39:25.208 --> 03:39:34.231]  I was doing an interview and I was sitting there watching 28 snipers packing in their personal weapons into the compound where they took over a school.
[03:39:35.014 --> 03:39:38.856]  And they're all up in the compound as command headquarters by our courthouse.
[03:39:40.376 --> 03:39:54.182]  Now, even though they have arrested the majority of the people that were there, or they have now gone home, and there's only four people in that wildlife refuge, you've continued, you've seen the federal government continue to build up forces in the area, is that correct?
[03:39:55.323 --> 03:39:57.324]  Oh yeah, we've seen MRAPs coming in yesterday.
[03:39:57.344 --> 03:40:01.446]  I live out here on 20 and that, coming in from then.
[03:40:01.766 --> 03:40:04.447]  Constant buildup of more and more MRAPs showing up.
[03:40:05.762 --> 03:40:19.772]  Well, you know, with the death of LaVoy Finnegan, we don't want to ignore that, but LaVoy Finnegan, I think, himself would want us to focus, to continue to focus on the underlying issues that he was trying to protest, that he was trying to educate people about.
[03:40:19.812 --> 03:40:27.578]  Of course, they were on their way to a meeting of 400 people in an adjacent county when they were arrested, the people that were with him, and when he was shot.
[03:40:28.659 --> 03:40:31.721]  Tell me about the general mood of the community there.
[03:40:33.282 --> 03:40:34.103]  The general mood is
[03:40:34.810 --> 03:40:37.012]  We're outraged, we're shocked.
[03:40:38.793 --> 03:40:44.378]  And well-spoken, very versed man was killed for no reason at all.
[03:40:44.658 --> 03:40:46.599]  They were going to a meeting of the people.
[03:40:47.140 --> 03:40:50.983]  In Horney County, we have one gentleman, he's 79 years old, going on 80.
[03:40:53.325 --> 03:40:59.029]  On Saturday, he called up and said he was going down to protest the ambush and assassination of Lil' Boy Vinnigan.
[03:40:59.509 --> 03:41:01.631]  And so we all went down there to support him.
[03:41:02.512 --> 03:41:03.993]  And it was pretty cool seeing that
[03:41:04.585 --> 03:41:11.609]  Father and his two sons standing there against the government and the people coming together to join with him.
[03:41:13.010 --> 03:41:15.111]  Yeah, tell us about that meeting.
[03:41:15.131 --> 03:41:19.394]  What did you know about the meeting that was going to be taking place in John Day, Oregon, the one that they were on their way to?
[03:41:20.874 --> 03:41:25.597]  It was a constitutional meeting, talking about the Constitution and all the land grabs that's going on in our country.
[03:41:25.637 --> 03:41:26.578]  We were right behind.
[03:41:26.598 --> 03:41:28.319]  We were about three miles behind.
[03:41:31.687 --> 03:41:48.779]  Behind Amon and behind Lavoie when they were headed up there, we got turned around at the junction by FBI, state police, and Harney County Sheriff's Office, all packed in heavily armed weapons that you wouldn't use in a civil matter.
[03:41:48.859 --> 03:41:50.300]  This was a military buildup.
[03:41:50.940 --> 03:41:53.922]  And they turned us around and I got a phone call right then.
[03:41:54.002 --> 03:41:57.445]  I have some horses a quarter mile down from that blockade.
[03:41:57.465 --> 03:41:59.726]  And I have an older horse.
[03:41:59.766 --> 03:42:00.186]  He was old.
[03:42:00.226 --> 03:42:00.987]  He lived a good life.
[03:42:01.604 --> 03:42:03.085]  But he was dying.
[03:42:03.125 --> 03:42:04.866]  He was, you know, he's on his last leg.
[03:42:05.686 --> 03:42:08.728]  And he was laying there and there was no way we could put him out of the misery.
[03:42:08.748 --> 03:42:11.690]  We couldn't get ahold of the veterinarian to get drugs to put him out of his misery.
[03:42:12.970 --> 03:42:16.592]  And we were just thinking about just dispatching him and putting him down.
[03:42:17.533 --> 03:42:22.055]  But if we would have, we'd have had the cops all around us because we were so close to that barricade.
[03:42:22.736 --> 03:42:30.560]  And I was down at a meeting the following morning and I told the sheriff I had a horse to put down that was dying slow death.
[03:42:31.420 --> 03:42:35.723]  And there was nothing I could do, I couldn't do nothing but, you know, put him down with a bullet.
[03:42:36.764 --> 03:42:44.709]  And the sheriff responded, well I'm glad you didn't because we'd have been over there and we'd have probably shot you thinking it was a terrorist activity or something.
[03:42:45.435 --> 03:42:46.195]  That's just amazing.
[03:42:46.495 --> 03:42:52.438]  That's just amazing, because nothing had happened to make the federal authorities believe that they were under any threat.
[03:42:52.458 --> 03:42:54.539]  Nobody had ever used any weapons.
[03:42:54.559 --> 03:42:55.879]  They were in a remote location.
[03:42:56.259 --> 03:43:01.301]  And we've got to remember that the only violence that's occurred here has been on the part of the federal authorities.
[03:43:01.801 --> 03:43:03.822]  But talk to me about the Hammonds.
[03:43:03.882 --> 03:43:05.123]  You know the Hammonds in the area.
[03:43:05.143 --> 03:43:08.324]  And that's really what was the touchpoint that set this all off.
[03:43:08.364 --> 03:43:12.806]  The fact that the BLM and the forestry services would send them
[03:43:13.706 --> 03:43:28.838]  To jail as arsonists and terrorists when they lit a backfire that burned only 139 acres to protect their own property when there were forest fires that year that were over 3 million acres burned in Oregon and the BLM itself.
[03:43:29.318 --> 03:43:41.389]  Had used backfires as a tool of fire control, destroying private property, and yet they take these two individuals and label them as arsonists and terrorists so they can get a mandatory minimum of five years.
[03:43:41.409 --> 03:43:43.651]  The judge said it offended his sensibilities.
[03:43:43.991 --> 03:43:47.134]  Tell us about the Hammonds and what you know about that.
[03:43:48.535 --> 03:43:51.118]  Dwayne and Susie, they're good people, they're good friends of mine.
[03:43:51.158 --> 03:43:54.721]  Back in the 90s when this all really started kicking off,
[03:43:55.939 --> 03:43:59.882]  The Dwight's had a piece of land, they filed for the water rights on all their land.
[03:44:00.883 --> 03:44:14.312]  The federal government, through the Refuge, went down and convinced the Oregon state government that wildlife has priority over the water compared to anybody else, compared to your livestock and your ranches and that.
[03:44:14.893 --> 03:44:23.859]  So the government, the state of Oregon being a liberal state, gave the Refuge permission, water rights, and they started fencing off the water holes so the cows couldn't water up
[03:44:24.622 --> 03:44:25.983]  And then they started blocking roads.
[03:44:26.123 --> 03:44:29.045]  That Hammond, they had a small piece of land between their privates.
[03:44:29.686 --> 03:44:41.774]  To get to their private land, they started fencing off the roads with gates and with barricades to keep the Hammonds from checking on their cows, to feed their cows, and take care of their cows, and water their cows.
[03:44:42.374 --> 03:44:43.856]  They put a fence around the waterhole.
[03:44:44.756 --> 03:44:49.900]  The Hammonds wanted to remove that fence, and that started, the Sheriff went down there and started harassing them.
[03:44:50.760 --> 03:44:51.481]  Sheriff Dave Blair,
[03:44:52.950 --> 03:44:54.230]  And it just kept escalating.
[03:44:54.250 --> 03:44:57.751]  The more the government wanted that place, the more they started harassing them.
[03:44:58.592 --> 03:45:06.134]  The place is adjacent to the Malheur Refuge and the Steens Mountain Monument that Bill Clinton made after a geological survey.
[03:45:06.154 --> 03:45:12.896]  And that found precious minerals, uranium, gold, and natural gases on their land.
[03:45:13.696 --> 03:45:17.877]  The government wanted to take hold of the land, so they were trying to break them through intimidation.
[03:45:18.817 --> 03:45:21.418]  Then they went and had this fire situation.
[03:45:22.332 --> 03:45:29.376]  Was backburned to take care of the forage so the fire didn't travel into the ranch, protect the ranch.
[03:45:30.537 --> 03:45:32.838]  And the BLM came at them.
[03:45:32.858 --> 03:45:33.718]  They had permission.
[03:45:33.758 --> 03:45:34.739]  They called the BLM.
[03:45:34.779 --> 03:45:38.341]  They called the fire marshal, gave them permission to do it.
[03:45:39.141 --> 03:45:50.708]  About five years later, they came back at them and called them terrorists for burning that pasture to take care of any forage so the fire didn't travel into their ranch and destroy their houses.
[03:45:52.889 --> 03:45:57.974]  What do you think is the final objective of the BLM?
[03:45:58.014 --> 03:46:00.256]  Because we've seen this type of thing happen before.
[03:46:01.417 --> 03:46:03.619]  We've seen testimony that was put up.
[03:46:03.659 --> 03:46:12.247]  We put it up on our site of a land officer that's with the park services, retiring and moving from one location.
[03:46:12.287 --> 03:46:13.948]  Actually, she wasn't retiring out of the service.
[03:46:13.988 --> 03:46:16.571]  She was just retiring from one location, moving to another.
[03:46:16.931 --> 03:46:17.732]  Talking about how
[03:46:18.512 --> 03:46:22.056]  The BLM, the land people, said we're the bad guys.
[03:46:22.096 --> 03:46:23.898]  We're the ones who take people's property.
[03:46:23.938 --> 03:46:26.621]  We always pay far less than it's worth.
[03:46:26.661 --> 03:46:34.148]  Talking about how they had taken something that was appraised for over $40 million from a couple of miners who had been in World War II.
[03:46:34.208 --> 03:46:35.249]  They were elderly miners.
[03:46:35.269 --> 03:46:39.734]  They got it for just $2.5 million instead of the $40 million that it was appraised at.
[03:46:40.094 --> 03:46:40.855]  Bragging about
[03:46:42.015 --> 03:46:47.859]  Over 100,000 acres that this one individual had taken, and they labeled her the acquisition queen.
[03:46:47.979 --> 03:46:50.160]  What is their endgame with this, you believe?
[03:46:51.421 --> 03:46:53.041]  Their endgame is to control the land.
[03:46:53.302 --> 03:47:01.046]  As they told the Hammonds, if they sign over the rights of their ranch, basically give it to the government, they would not be persecuted.
[03:47:01.446 --> 03:47:02.967]  Right there is a big red flag.
[03:47:03.667 --> 03:47:05.008]  You want that ranch so bad.
[03:47:05.558 --> 03:47:13.141]  That you're going to persecute these guys and send them into bankruptcy and then steal the land with first right of refusal that they forced the Hammonds to sign.
[03:47:14.122 --> 03:47:15.502]  But yet you offer them this deal.
[03:47:15.963 --> 03:47:17.843]  You sign over the ranch and we won't persecute.
[03:47:17.863 --> 03:47:20.925]  That shows how much of a scam this whole thing was.
[03:47:21.758 --> 03:47:31.643]  And I talked to a logger down in John Day, his name is Tad Halp, and he was talking about how they have pushed the logging industry essentially into bankruptcy.
[03:47:31.723 --> 03:47:36.885]  Very few people there in that town have jobs anymore unless they work for the state or federal government.
[03:47:37.445 --> 03:47:45.469]  They put regulations in there that have not only restricted the loggers, but at the same time have increased exponentially the fire danger.
[03:47:45.569 --> 03:47:51.791]  They allow so much deadwood to be there, they won't even allow the loggers to take the deadwood out for the preservation of the forest.
[03:47:52.171 --> 03:47:56.952]  They could preserve the forest, they could allow people to earn a living as they have in the past.
[03:47:57.513 --> 03:47:59.613]  That was what was good management about the area.
[03:47:59.633 --> 03:48:01.414]  It was a win-win situation all the way around.
[03:48:01.954 --> 03:48:09.920]  But it seems like the federal government would rather burn the forest down so they can burn out these people who are making a living out of that area.
[03:48:09.940 --> 03:48:16.264]  People who are using it even for recreational use are not going to have the use of these forests if the BLM allows them to burn down.
[03:48:17.545 --> 03:48:21.028]  Yes, well I can point you right up here to Lemon Lake where I was running cows.
[03:48:22.909 --> 03:48:23.750]  A fire came through in 2007.
[03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:25.531]  It was a big fire, burned 187,000 acres at the complex.
[03:48:29.585 --> 03:48:36.768]  In that fire, after they were done, the government paid contractors to build a fence.
[03:48:36.808 --> 03:48:42.270]  The fence cost us $21,000 per fence, per mile, to remove the old fence and put in a new fence.
[03:48:42.790 --> 03:48:56.175]  But at the same time, the BLM wanted to take the trees back from those fences that we paid that much money for on 90 miles of fence, move trees back a tree and a half, so we didn't have old, burnt trees falling on the fence.
[03:48:59.406 --> 03:49:05.909]  Honda, Oregon Natural Desert Association, whatever they call themselves, and Sierra Club sued them, and they couldn't cut back the trees.
[03:49:06.709 --> 03:49:22.716]  Then they wanted to clear the lumber, and then sued them again, and they couldn't take only 150 feet off the roads, that lumber, which left a lot of lumber sitting up there, big hunking trees, big trees, laying up there burnt, that's falling across the fence.
[03:49:22.736 --> 03:49:28.239]  They just put up the following year, we were repairing fences like crazy, from damaged trees coming across.
[03:49:29.245 --> 03:49:34.087]  And they left all those trees up there to be, as I say, fuel for the next fire.
[03:49:34.107 --> 03:49:40.829]  The next fire we get up in that country, Burns is probably going to go because that fire always travels towards Burns.
[03:49:41.449 --> 03:49:44.630]  Burns will probably go because it's going to be such a buildup of fuel up there.
[03:49:44.650 --> 03:49:47.551]  Dead trees, that is amazing.
[03:49:47.991 --> 03:49:54.433]  Riding horses, pushing cows, you're afraid of trees falling over you as you're going through there from the wind damage and that.
[03:49:54.912 --> 03:49:55.112]  Yeah.
[03:49:55.693 --> 03:50:11.151]  Yeah, and as Ted Halp, the logger, was telling me, and of course he's worked in this industry his entire life, he was saying that typically you would want to have no more than about two tons of fuel, meaning that's all the dead matter, the trees, the limbs, and leaves, that sort of thing.
[03:50:11.191 --> 03:50:14.255]  He said the BLM, or the Forestry Services,
[03:50:15.496 --> 03:50:21.158]  Standards were 6 to 10, but he goes, in reality, they allowed up to 500 tons.
[03:50:21.398 --> 03:50:32.163]  So they're allowing up to 250 times what he would believe would be safe, or even by their highest numbers, it would still be about 50 times what they say is safe.
[03:50:32.183 --> 03:50:33.764]  So that's why they're having these massive fires.
[03:50:34.024 --> 03:50:42.747]  I believe they had the largest fire ever this last summer that basically wiped out his private property as well as a lot of public lands.
[03:50:42.767 --> 03:50:44.268]  We're seeing that over and over again.
[03:50:45.583 --> 03:50:48.424]  Yeah, it's destroyed.
[03:50:48.944 --> 03:50:51.205]  We're going to take a break, Tom.
[03:50:51.425 --> 03:50:57.767]  We're talking to Tom Davis, a rancher that is in the Oregon area, talking about what they're really seeing in this area.
[03:50:57.787 --> 03:51:00.268]  When we come back, I want to talk briefly to Michael Emery.
[03:51:00.628 --> 03:51:03.349]  He's been there reporting on this situation from the very beginning.
[03:51:03.369 --> 03:51:04.050]  Stay with us.
[03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.570]  We'll be right back.

[03:54:12.777 --> 03:54:14.078]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:14.159 --> 03:54:31.877]  I'm David Knight and we're going to be going back to some people on the ground in Oregon where we have seen the protests, the standoff, the killing of LaVoy Finnicum and they are still, even after there's only four people left at this reservation and protest, they are still escalating force
[03:54:31.957 --> 03:54:32.457]  I think so.
[03:54:48.724 --> 03:54:51.865]  Or things that he has seen that the mainstream media has told us lies about.
[03:54:51.885 --> 03:54:53.066]  We're going to go to him in just a moment.
[03:54:53.106 --> 03:54:57.788]  Real quickly, we have a new product at InfoWarsLife.com, AnthroPlex.

[03:55:41.354 --> 03:55:43.676]  Going back to Oregon, I want to talk to Michael Emery.
[03:55:43.716 --> 03:55:45.537]  He's with the Voice of Idaho News.
[03:55:45.597 --> 03:55:50.701]  He's been covering this for the local news there since this all began.
[03:55:51.562 --> 03:56:00.869]  Mr. Emery, tell us what you would like to... We've only got a couple of minutes left, so give us the highlights of what you would like people to know that hasn't really come out so far.
[03:56:02.313 --> 03:56:09.437]  Well, we have a massive amount of propaganda going on out here that people are hungry for the news.
[03:56:09.657 --> 03:56:16.021]  And it seems to me that there's just such a disconnection between mainstream and what's really going on.
[03:56:16.241 --> 03:56:17.562]  And to wrap this up,
[03:56:18.836 --> 03:56:33.145]  Good officers are out here trying to do the right thing and they brought us White House assets in to stop the Bundy's with evidence that was going to the Grants County Sheriff to take over this case.
[03:56:33.186 --> 03:56:34.446]  That's what this is all about.
[03:56:35.027 --> 03:56:38.409]  See, the redress of grievance was what this is all about.
[03:56:39.096 --> 03:56:44.904]  And within that redress of grievance, it had prosecuting attorneys and stuff that would go to jail.
[03:56:45.204 --> 03:56:46.246]  That's what this is about.
[03:56:46.446 --> 03:56:50.311]  So let's break this down for people who are listening to this.
[03:56:50.351 --> 03:56:53.495]  Now, a lot of this stuff in Burns, Oregon, that was happening in Harney County.
[03:56:54.516 --> 03:57:13.634]  On the day that they were headed to this meeting with 400 people, they were headed to neighboring Grant County, and you're telling me that there were good officers who were trying to get this jurisdiction relocated, or this whole case relocated, to Grant County to talk to that sheriff at the time that they arrested those people there and shot and killed LaVoy Finnicum.
[03:57:14.793 --> 03:57:15.734]  That's exactly right.
[03:57:15.754 --> 03:57:19.537]  They had evidence, too, that we still have available that they didn't get.
[03:57:19.917 --> 03:57:21.738]  And this is an ongoing situation.
[03:57:21.779 --> 03:57:27.743]  What this is is a hostile environment where they do not want due process of law.
[03:57:27.823 --> 03:57:28.824]  That's what this is about.
[03:57:29.525 --> 03:57:33.568]  And the three percenters and the PPN are trying to protect the people out here.
[03:57:33.588 --> 03:57:37.351]  And I can tell everybody out there that we are in very dire straits.
[03:57:38.512 --> 03:57:39.573]  We're doing what we can.
[03:57:42.016 --> 03:57:43.558]  Don't believe what the mainstream is saying.
[03:57:53.049 --> 03:57:55.132]  And then we saw an interview yesterday with CNN.
[03:57:55.252 --> 03:57:56.254]  What did you think about that?
[03:57:56.274 --> 03:58:04.266]  It looked like they were really trying to discredit Victoria Sharpe, this 18-year-old singer, part of a family gospel singer group that was going to that meeting.
[03:58:04.767 --> 03:58:05.889]  What did you think about that interview?
[03:58:05.909 --> 03:58:07.712]  And we've only got about 20 seconds left.
[03:58:08.803 --> 03:58:13.126]  Well, I would say that everybody gave up and they said, don't shoot.
[03:58:13.306 --> 03:58:17.668]  We have women and children and the federal government decided to fire upon that vehicle.
[03:58:18.088 --> 03:58:19.849]  She has all the credibility in the world.
[03:58:20.230 --> 03:58:23.912]  Anybody that would disrespect her, I have pity for them.
[03:58:24.392 --> 03:58:35.778]  It's absolutely amazing when they come out and say that they had to shoot him, that he was a threat, that they had to then subsequently shoot that car repeatedly, and yet the first officer that you see there is behind that car.
[03:58:35.818 --> 03:58:37.359]  Does he really think that car is a threat?
[03:58:38.020 --> 03:58:41.001]  I mean, he's going after LaVoy Finnecombe and they don't shoot at him until later.
[03:58:41.361 --> 03:58:42.502]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:58:42.562 --> 03:58:44.723]  Join us tonight at 7 central, 8 p.m.
