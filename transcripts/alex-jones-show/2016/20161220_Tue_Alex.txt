[00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:23.451]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:28.925]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:00:32.552 --> 00:00:35.775]  Well, it's official, Donald Trump is President 45.
[00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:42.500]  And he'll be seated, if he's not assassinated, or if there isn't a World War III, in 30 days.
[00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:56.071]  We're now just 30 days out from the historic inauguration, but we're still going to keep counting down because we saw the Russian ambassador to Turkey gunned down in an art exhibit by a Turkish police officer, screaming, Allah Akbar!
[00:00:56.651 --> 00:00:59.253]  But of course, this has nothing to do with Islam, as usual.
[00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:08.522]  Just like the 89 dead in Nice and the 400 plus wounded, that attack in July, and now of course we have the new attack in Berlin.
[00:01:08.542 --> 00:01:14.447]  12 dead, more than 70 people injured, many of them in critical condition.
[00:01:16.448 --> 00:01:20.012]  And first we heard it was a self-driving truck, but they don't make one for that company.
[00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:26.297]  And then we heard it was a young Pakistani illegal immigrant, or what's the term they use for them?
[00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:26.858]  Migrants.
[00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.911]  And now they're saying they don't know who.
[00:01:30.912 --> 00:01:32.873]  So the media is calling it a truck attack.
[00:01:33.613 --> 00:01:47.222]  Of course, a month or so ago in Ohio, we were told that the Somali stabbing nine people trying to run folks over was not Islamic, even though he pledged allegiance to ISIS and Al Qaeda and was here illegally as usual.
[00:01:48.632 --> 00:01:51.913]  Obama came out and lectured everyone that we should not criticize Islam.
[00:01:52.473 --> 00:01:56.874]  There aren't many Muslim countries where they let Christians or Jews or anybody else live in peace.
[00:01:57.354 --> 00:02:00.255]  There aren't many Muslim countries where women don't have to wear bags over their heads.
[00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:06.197]  There aren't many Muslim countries where the Muslims live in peace with each other.
[00:02:06.277 --> 00:02:06.897]  My God!
[00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:08.258]  I don't want to be at war with the Muslims.
[00:02:08.298 --> 00:02:09.458]  I was against the Iraq War!
[00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:15.330]  I was against toppling Saddam, who was one of the only secular people in the region.
[00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:26.599]  And our government, as usual, is trying to overthrow Assad, who is secular, and where Jews and Christians and people could live, and non-radical Muslims, Alawites, some of the Shiites.
[00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:27.680]  That's not the case now.
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.146]  Our government, as usual, is allied with radical orthodox Islam, orthodox Wahhabist Islam.
[00:02:35.486 --> 00:02:36.407]  And why is that?
[00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:40.159]  Because Saudi Arabia sits on top of Mecca.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.087]  Saudi Arabia, the modern country carved out of the Bedouin lands, is what British intelligence put in charge of the region.
[00:02:48.487 --> 00:02:49.789]  You know, Lawrence of Arabia.
[00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.314]  And it's the most radical, oppressive form of it, and it's taking over all of Islam.
[00:02:57.095 --> 00:03:02.180]  Were there historically golden arrows of Islam when it wasn't expansionist, when it wasn't arts and sciences?
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.501]  Yes.
[00:03:04.411 --> 00:03:10.714]  But just ask Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire, what was left of the Roman Empire, about Islam, they'll tell ya!
[00:03:11.655 --> 00:03:21.399]  That Blue Mosque there in Turkey, formerly of course Constantinople is now Istanbul.
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.702]  And the men were all killed, and the women were put into sex slavery.
[00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:33.076]  Of course, the men were all killed slowly, put in as galley slaves, but again, that's the religion of peace.
[00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:35.297]  I'm cursed with knowing a little bit of history.
[00:03:36.837 --> 00:03:46.842]  And so now we have the latest vicious Allah Akbar attack, and the media is doing everything it can to cover it up, and we're hearing that this is Merkel's fault.
[00:03:47.622 --> 00:03:50.624]  We have German ministers coming out in the parliament saying it's Merkel's fault.
[00:03:52.008 --> 00:04:00.834]  Why, if you were in the Netherlands and you were a member of the Parliament and said that, you'd be arrested and indicted and convicted, like we just saw a few weeks ago.
[00:04:00.854 --> 00:04:04.176]  We're going to be breaking that down as well today.
[00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:24.845]  Because the social engineers admit they're bringing in millions and millions and millions of Muslims from radical third-world hellholes who are completely incompatible with Western civilization to make us then conform to it and change our laws so we don't stir them up.
[00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:27.167]  And then we have to ban our free speech.
[00:04:27.647 --> 00:04:28.768]  Could we bring Kurds here?
[00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:31.090]  Kurds historically integrate.
[00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.211]  Could we bring
[00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.340]  Iraqis here 30, 40 years ago that would integrate, yes, but now radical groups have taken over Iraq.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.141]  That's not really the case.
[00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:42.461]  Do Somalis end up attacking and murdering?
[00:04:42.501 --> 00:04:42.842]  Yes.
[00:04:44.362 --> 00:04:45.922]  Do Saudi Arabians end up doing that?
[00:04:45.982 --> 00:04:46.262]  Yes.
[00:04:46.403 --> 00:04:55.925]  I mean, folks, if you preach the gospel on the streets of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, you get multiple years in prison the next time you get executed.
[00:04:55.945 --> 00:04:58.626]  Oh, and if you're gay, you're dead.
[00:04:59.605 --> 00:05:06.927]  But see, I'm a right-wing extremist because I don't want to accept people that are completely intolerant and chain women up like dogs.
[00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:08.047]  We'll be back.
[00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:17.370]  John H. Glenn has died.
[00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:27.253]  Astronaut John Glenn, one of the original seven Mercury astronauts, has passed.
[00:05:27.273 --> 00:05:28.453]  95 years old, was he?
[00:05:29.414 --> 00:05:33.275]  Damn, that's a, that's a pretty good contract, I'd say.
[00:05:33.295 --> 00:05:33.275]  95.
[00:05:33.315 --> 00:05:36.516]  A senator after that.
[00:05:36.897 --> 00:05:43.199]  He went, uh, he went up I think on one of the shuttle missions at some point when he was pretty, um...
[00:05:44.298 --> 00:05:44.778]  Pretty old.
[00:05:44.798 --> 00:05:52.503]  I mean the guy was right there at the beginning of the manned space program here in America.
[00:05:52.983 --> 00:05:58.887]  We were fighting against the Russians for supremacy in space.
[00:05:59.967 --> 00:06:01.328]  And there it is, yeah.
[00:06:01.868 --> 00:06:06.330]  The transcontinental flight speed record before being the first American to orbit the Earth in 62.
[00:06:06.731 --> 00:06:15.215]  36 years later at the age of 77 in 1998 becoming the oldest man in space as a member of the seven astronaut crew of the space shuttle Discovery.
[00:06:16.015 --> 00:06:17.936]  Just an amazing career.
[00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:24.760]  It is kind of sad to see because he got to see
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:43.951]  The amazing strides we made, especially early on, going from him as a Mercury astronaut, watching men walk on the moon, the shuttle program, all the amazing strides we made in manned spaceflight.
[00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:46.993]  And then, at the end of his life, he gets to see
[00:06:47.993 --> 00:06:57.559]  Us having to hitchhike a ride with the Russians on the, uh, ancient, uh, Soyuz capsules.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.342]  And it had to be a little disappointing for, uh, for the man, for John Glenn.
[00:07:04.603 --> 00:07:14.269]  Uh, because he was one of the, just a pioneer and in a time where it was just about, hey, we need to get this done and, uh,
[00:07:15.436 --> 00:07:16.937]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[00:07:17.758 --> 00:07:21.220]  Get in the capsule and we're just gonna light it up and see what happens.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:38.911]  Just a bunch of really brave men and I think some of the Millennials and college students should look at some of these amazing men like John Glenn and like some of the people we saw at Pearl Harbor yesterday.
[00:07:40.873 --> 00:07:42.394]  Godspeed John Glenn!
[00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:25.637]  On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake.
[00:08:26.677 --> 00:08:31.138]  His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.
[00:08:31.658 --> 00:08:32.738]  Oh well, she cried.
[00:08:33.218 --> 00:08:35.599]  I'll take you in, and I'll take care of you.
[00:08:36.979 --> 00:08:38.420]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.440]  Take me in, for heaven's sake.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.541]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:08:43.561 --> 00:08:44.041]  Sighed.
[00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.171]  The Vicious Snake.
[00:08:50.374 --> 00:08:52.615]  This could be the great Trojan horse of all time.
[00:08:53.276 --> 00:08:56.098]  Because you look at the migration, study it, look at it.
[00:08:56.819 --> 00:08:59.360]  Now they'll start infiltrating with women and children.
[00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.183]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:09:02.603 --> 00:09:04.084]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[00:09:04.905 --> 00:09:06.386]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:09:07.524 --> 00:09:10.406]  Sighed the vicious snake.
[00:09:11.327 --> 00:09:13.849]  Now she clutched him to her bosom.
[00:09:14.289 --> 00:09:16.150]  You're so beautiful, she cried.
[00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:21.214]  But if I hadn't brought you in, by now you might have died.
[00:09:22.316 --> 00:09:27.461]  She stroked his pretty skin, and then she kissed and held him tight.
[00:09:28.422 --> 00:09:35.929]  But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[00:09:36.349 --> 00:09:37.911]  I saved you, cried the woman.
[00:09:38.988 --> 00:09:40.188]  And you've bit me.
[00:09:40.588 --> 00:09:41.629]  Heavens, why?
[00:09:42.609 --> 00:09:44.549]  You know your bite is poisonous.
[00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:47.130]  And now I'm going to die.
[00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.231]  Oh, shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:58.253]  You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
[00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:08.908]  30 days.
[00:10:08.928 --> 00:10:20.024]  30 days until Donald J. Trump will be seated as the 45th President of the United States of America.
[00:10:20.044 --> 00:10:22.147]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:10:23.286 --> 00:10:50.700]  The globalists are pulling out every stop they can to plunge the world into war and cause civil unrest here in the United States and to raise interest rates to begin to plunge and disintegrate the Trump exuberance that we're seeing in the economy back in to the doldrums so the globalists, the rent seekers, can try to fully suffocate the economy and complete our journey into modern serfdom.
[00:10:52.245 --> 00:10:53.185]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:10:53.205 --> 00:11:00.147]  Thank you for joining us on this Tuesday, 20th day of December 2016 worldwide transmission.
[00:11:03.328 --> 00:11:12.150]  I was on national Russian television this morning and I was talking to some of the top intellectuals in Russia on the broadcast.
[00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:21.392]  Some of the people that advised Vladimir Putin and we were discussing the fact that the globalist or eugenicist establishing a planetary government
[00:11:22.244 --> 00:11:30.071]  They're playing nation states off against each other and trying to kill prosperity so that they can dictate the terms of human surrender to the populations.
[00:11:30.672 --> 00:11:46.225]  How they're racing to put robots in and put AI in all of our homes, surveilling us, selling it to us via Trojan horse systems, and how the United States, Russia, Japan, and the rest of the world must link up together to try to free communist China
[00:11:47.108 --> 00:11:47.308]  We're good.
[00:12:08.652 --> 00:12:12.394]  Around the world now understand the true globalist blueprint.
[00:12:13.195 --> 00:12:14.035]  It's now out there.
[00:12:14.135 --> 00:12:15.396]  It's now safe to talk about it.
[00:12:15.877 --> 00:12:18.058]  It's now accepted in intellectual circles.
[00:12:18.498 --> 00:12:27.664]  And that is the beginning of the end of the eugenics-based New World Order that Adolf A. Lois Hitler was only a small bad son spinoff of.
[00:12:29.305 --> 00:12:30.406]  Our analysis is dead on.
[00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:31.546]  It's been transmitted.
[00:12:31.586 --> 00:12:32.707]  The signal's already been released.
[00:12:33.328 --> 00:12:34.288]  You can kill me now.
[00:12:34.428 --> 00:12:35.349]  You won't stop any of it.
[00:12:36.598 --> 00:12:40.541]  And I don't want to give myself more than credit I'm due.
[00:12:41.341 --> 00:12:50.668]  We were the detonators taking information that was in academic circles that the globalists were arrogant about, believing the public was too stupid to even read it or care.
[00:12:51.128 --> 00:12:55.311]  We popularized it and rammed it out there into the open.
[00:12:56.391 --> 00:12:59.213]  And the people are now learning about the new world order.
[00:12:59.333 --> 00:13:00.434]  They're learning about globalism.
[00:13:00.454 --> 00:13:05.758]  They're learning about its operating system, how it takes over countries, and then what its endgame is.
[00:13:06.912 --> 00:13:21.298]  And once you find out about the endgame, you're living in a real science fiction nightmare dystopia that's taking place in the middle of this incredibly exciting, wondrous, opportunity-filled world of wonder.
[00:13:22.579 --> 00:13:23.479]  So it's a paradox.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:31.163]  And we're now discovering it's the best of times, the worst of times, together.
[00:13:32.096 --> 00:13:37.140]  And that the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.383]  Now, obviously we have the Russian ambassador killed.
[00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:54.712]  The Russians have come out, the Turks have come out, saying this is not state-sponsored by them, that this is NATO, just like World War I, trying to kick off a major war.
[00:13:54.972 --> 00:13:58.835]  Another Russian ambassador was assassinated at his home yesterday.
[00:14:00.555 --> 00:14:04.998]  That may have been, they're saying, somebody finding somebody in the bed, but somebody shouldn't be.
[00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:07.720]  That's not confirmed, that's just what is being said.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.621]  Coincidence?
[00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:09.281]  Probably not.
[00:14:09.942 --> 00:14:14.765]  Things happen in politics, to quote Edward Mandel House, you can bet they were playing that way.
[00:14:16.166 --> 00:14:18.127]  So there is a lot going on.
[00:14:18.247 --> 00:14:26.173]  Public executions of Russian ambassadors, private executions, and if you're a TV viewer,
[00:14:27.264 --> 00:14:29.405]  We just go where the news is.
[00:14:29.485 --> 00:14:31.706]  We're not trying to be sensational.
[00:14:31.726 --> 00:14:32.987]  We're not trying to be shock jocks.
[00:14:33.347 --> 00:14:34.668]  Reality is sensational.
[00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:41.211]  So maybe once a month you see death and carnage and explosions on the show if you're watching and not a listener.
[00:14:41.671 --> 00:14:48.755]  But we are showing you the video they've expunged off the web of Nice in July where 80 plus people were run over including small children.
[00:14:49.535 --> 00:14:54.478]  It's nothing compared to the video games like Grand Theft Auto and the rest of it.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:05.065]  But notice they want you to see simulated violence, much more graphically, but they don't want you to see a truck from 200 yards away running over people, because then it's real.
[00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.086]  And then you might want to do something about it.
[00:15:07.587 --> 00:15:09.828]  So viewer discretion is advised.
[00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:13.299]  But notice you can see all the simulated murder and death.
[00:15:13.619 --> 00:15:17.861]  They can show it to even PG crowds at night at seven o'clock during the dinner hour.
[00:15:18.181 --> 00:15:24.403]  But they don't want us to show you what Islamic terror is doing all over this world.
[00:15:24.683 --> 00:15:26.244]  Well, we're going to show it.
[00:15:27.724 --> 00:15:39.329]  And if people try to censor it on Facebook or on Google's platforms like YouTube, that's why people are leaving you in droves and watching the raw feeds at InfoWars.com.
[00:15:41.914 --> 00:15:47.096]  Infowars.com forward slash show so they can see what the establishment doesn't want you to see.
[00:15:47.456 --> 00:15:48.836]  Do we show simulated violence?
[00:15:48.876 --> 00:15:49.517]  No, we don't show it.
[00:15:50.737 --> 00:15:58.540]  But we show you in documentary format, which quite frankly, we can even show you on FCC TV stations that we're on.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.281]  And you know how we were able to do that and get around the quote?
[00:16:03.291 --> 00:16:11.838]  profanity or, or, or, or, you know, vileness clauses that are out there, you know, the indecency clauses, because it's documentary format.
[00:16:12.119 --> 00:16:18.984]  You ever watch PBS when you're a kid, and there's cuss words, and there's blood, and there's death, and you see executions in, you know, Vietnam or something?
[00:16:20.686 --> 00:16:22.527]  For the Vietnam War, and you ask, how am I seeing this?
[00:16:22.928 --> 00:16:24.449]  This isn't on regular broadcast TV.
[00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.693]  Well, how did Walker Cronkite show naked kids running around who've been napalmed
[00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:32.316]  With their skin hanging off at six o'clock at night.
[00:16:32.976 --> 00:16:34.116]  Because it's real!
[00:16:34.836 --> 00:16:38.758]  You're not supposed to show a bunch of simulated murder and death because it makes light of it.
[00:16:39.058 --> 00:16:41.438]  You're supposed to show the real death!
[00:16:41.838 --> 00:16:45.599]  So people get sick and don't want it and do something about it!
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.740]  Everything's ass backwards.
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:55.762]  Walter Cronkite could show you naked little kids running down the street with their skin hanging off their backs and arms.
[00:16:57.423 --> 00:16:57.923]  Burn off!
[00:16:59.329 --> 00:17:00.309]  Like melted wax.
[00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.151]  And it ended the war that we shouldn't have been involved in.
[00:17:05.171 --> 00:17:09.132]  A big profiteering operation.
[00:17:11.432 --> 00:17:14.473]  Ho Chi Minh tried to work with the U.S., tried to bring us in.
[00:17:14.513 --> 00:17:16.614]  He was enemies of the Japanese during World War II.
[00:17:16.654 --> 00:17:17.414]  He was our ally.
[00:17:18.835 --> 00:17:20.315]  The globalists didn't want that.
[00:17:20.395 --> 00:17:25.196]  They wanted a new war to pump hundreds of billions in so LBJ could get rich and others could.
[00:17:25.937 --> 00:17:26.977]  So you know the rest of history.
[00:17:27.895 --> 00:17:29.255]  But that itself is a side issue.
[00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:31.436]  Just like Fidel Castro was CIA.
[00:17:31.636 --> 00:17:33.697]  You tell the average dumb yuppie that, they don't even know it.
[00:17:34.117 --> 00:17:35.657]  He was a communist, not CIA.
[00:17:36.077 --> 00:17:36.397]  Oh really?
[00:17:36.437 --> 00:17:37.377]  He was installed.
[00:17:37.638 --> 00:17:38.518]  Then he turned against them.
[00:17:38.778 --> 00:17:39.518]  More blowback.
[00:17:39.778 --> 00:17:40.998]  Or is it really blowback?
[00:17:41.418 --> 00:17:43.759]  Or are the globalists destabilizing countries on purpose?
[00:17:44.159 --> 00:17:45.079]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.841]  They put the Arab Spring in on purpose to destroy secularism, to destroy industry,
[00:17:52.145 --> 00:17:59.091]  You know where Europe for 30 years has been vacationing because it's cheap, and it's beautiful, and it's pristine, and it's amazing, and there's Roman ruins everywhere?
[00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:02.954]  I'm gonna skip this network break, this is too important.
[00:18:03.294 --> 00:18:03.714]  Do you know?
[00:18:07.097 --> 00:18:07.437]  Syria.
[00:18:08.318 --> 00:18:09.979]  There's no terrorism now to Syria.
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:21.489]  Almost six years after the West started a civil war there, using jihadis to go in and murder Christians and basically anybody else that didn't submit to them.
[00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:29.496]  And then they have TV movies on Netflix about how great the people are in Aleppo and how they're fighting the evil Assad.
[00:18:29.816 --> 00:18:31.558]  All made up crap.
[00:18:31.578 --> 00:18:35.641]  And they have HBO specials about Saddam, what a big monster he is.
[00:18:36.302 --> 00:18:40.786]  And of course the CIA now has to admit, oh he actually wasn't for Al Qaeda, he fought them.
[00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:44.529]  When he was interrogated he said, I'm CIA, why have you done this to me?
[00:18:44.849 --> 00:18:49.694]  Why'd you tell me to attack Iran and then tell me to invade Kuwait and then set me up and do all that?
[00:18:51.374 --> 00:18:55.336]  They said, we're not releasing you, we're handing you over to the Shiites, they're gonna hang your ass.
[00:18:56.476 --> 00:18:57.617]  All that came out this week.
[00:18:59.277 --> 00:18:59.998]  In the Daily Mail.
[00:19:00.438 --> 00:19:02.059]  You're not gonna hear about it here in the United States.
[00:19:03.219 --> 00:19:06.381]  So, that's what's going on in this country, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:06.681 --> 00:19:09.342]  That's who runs this nation, and that's how dumb they think we are.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.822]  But there's a rebellion throughout the government.
[00:19:14.142 --> 00:19:21.529]  That's why you see a high-level CIA interrogator come out and say he spent weeks with Saddam, and the headline is, everything we were told about him wasn't true.
[00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.632]  And Bush was dumb.
[00:19:25.092 --> 00:19:26.173]  Bush wasn't dumb!
[00:19:27.383 --> 00:19:37.065]  They were getting rid of an old policy from the 50s to put secular governments in the Middle East and try to bring them into the industrialized age that was set up by Eisenhower.
[00:19:37.645 --> 00:19:44.227]  And by the 80s, in the late 80s, they decided to reverse that entire program.
[00:19:48.947 --> 00:19:50.308]  Let's not put a Russian headline up.
[00:19:50.328 --> 00:19:51.288]  They'll say it's propaganda.
[00:19:51.488 --> 00:19:53.048]  Let's put the Daily Mail up or some U.S.
[00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:55.669]  papers that have the CIA interrogator breaking it all down.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.682]  Of course, you all heard that here 20 years ago on this broadcast.
[00:20:00.823 --> 00:20:12.551]  Because none of it was a secret that he was hired when he was an army captain when he was 20-something years old and sent to Cairo in the late 50s to be trained for two years by the CIA or that he was wounded trying to assassinate the communist leader.
[00:20:14.352 --> 00:20:19.435]  Then they pressured the Ba'athist in 69 to put him in as the head of security where they keep overthrowing the government.
[00:20:19.815 --> 00:20:22.197]  Then they did overthrow the government a decade later in 1979.
[00:20:22.417 --> 00:20:24.999]  They put Saddam into power and then told him to attack
[00:20:26.926 --> 00:20:33.470]  And gave him the weather reports and all the systems on how to deliver the mustard gas.
[00:20:35.812 --> 00:20:37.553]  I'm not lionizing Saddam Hussein.
[00:20:37.933 --> 00:20:40.255]  Just that guy compared to the Saudi Arabians is an angel.
[00:20:40.955 --> 00:20:42.897]  60% of the college graduates women.
[00:20:43.157 --> 00:20:44.217]  Nobody wearing burkas.
[00:20:44.478 --> 00:20:45.578]  Rock and roll music on.
[00:20:45.798 --> 00:20:47.019]  Playboy on the store shelves.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.061]  That's what he did in the Middle East.
[00:20:49.801 --> 00:20:54.384]  So much so that Europeans and Russians were going there right through the 80s to vacation.
[00:20:54.964 --> 00:20:55.505]  Not anymore.
[00:20:56.676 --> 00:20:57.697]  Blew the whole thing up!
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.422]  Because there's a new policy!
[00:21:01.542 --> 00:21:02.423]  Destabilize!
[00:21:02.503 --> 00:21:03.184]  Destroy!
[00:21:03.604 --> 00:21:04.565]  Overturn countries!
[00:21:05.326 --> 00:21:05.787]  Ruin them!
[00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:11.594]  And turn them over to the Saudi Arabians that keep giant slave brothels.
[00:21:12.115 --> 00:21:14.296]  Oh, but they call them harems so it's cute.
[00:21:14.937 --> 00:21:21.681]  Yeah, you get talking to me in a cocktail waitress in Saudi Arabia at some military base or something, you get off the base, you're never seen again.
[00:21:21.882 --> 00:21:26.365]  But that's okay because you're a woman and you're not going to hear one word out of Gloria Steinem about it.
[00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:34.811]  Because she's the establishment woman just teaching men and women how to fight with each other and teaching women you can't have a man, the state's your man.
[00:21:37.202 --> 00:21:40.883]  I've got articles today about women saying, just have an abortion to prove you're a feminist.
[00:21:40.964 --> 00:21:41.984]  It's so sexy.
[00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:45.325]  But I digress.
[00:21:45.365 --> 00:21:49.467]  Coming up today, this year we've seen multiple truck attacks.
[00:21:49.507 --> 00:21:53.649]  The guy tried to ram folks at Ohio State and stab nine people.
[00:21:53.989 --> 00:22:01.992]  But the local trendies said he was black, so it was wrong that the white officer shot him, even though he was running at him with a butcher knife.
[00:22:03.533 --> 00:22:11.044]  And of course, it was a Christmas party in San Bernardino, where he went and killed his co-workers with his wife, screaming, Allah Akbar!
[00:22:11.745 --> 00:22:15.670]  But that's okay again, because it has nothing to do with Islam.
[00:22:17.073 --> 00:22:17.794]  It never does.
[00:22:20.779 --> 00:22:23.900]  We're going to break down the Russians and the holding stabilization program.
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.902]  I told you last week, look for them to start wars and provocations in Syria.
[00:22:28.522 --> 00:22:29.803]  I have that from my sources.
[00:22:29.823 --> 00:22:34.625]  They're trying to kick off a major war between Turkey and Syria right now.
[00:22:34.965 --> 00:22:39.587]  They can then basically call in US forces so that they can start bombing.
[00:22:40.745 --> 00:22:43.208]  Because our military on the ground is refusing to.
[00:22:56.567 --> 00:23:10.374]  To back the backing of ISIS slash Al Qaeda for Obama and General Dempsey or the head of the Joint Chiefs went and told Obama that night, three plus years ago, we're not going to be part of this air campaign.
[00:23:10.594 --> 00:23:11.875]  The military is going to mutiny.
[00:23:12.275 --> 00:23:13.636]  What a historical event.
[00:23:13.956 --> 00:23:15.157]  Our military refusing.
[00:23:15.357 --> 00:23:16.818]  And they continue with WikiLeaks.
[00:23:17.338 --> 00:23:27.222]  To leak the criminality of the Democratic Party and the Republican establishment to expose the activity in an American counter-coup against the globalists that have hijacked this nation.
[00:23:27.862 --> 00:23:34.364]  And the Russians now, and the Europeans now, all know the real score, and they know they're occupied by mega-banks.
[00:23:35.125 --> 00:23:46.289]  And all over the world, countries, every time they have a vote, Italy two weeks ago, the UK four months ago, the United States five weeks ago,
[00:23:47.498 --> 00:23:50.159]  Iceland, four years ago.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.960]  Catalonia, this year.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.541]  Everybody's pulling out.
[00:23:54.641 --> 00:24:03.364]  Brazil's trying to pull out of these big central banks that just make up debt and make up money and sign countries onto a billion dollar loan like Nigeria.
[00:24:03.784 --> 00:24:14.949]  And 40 years later, they've paid back a hundred billion plus on one loan that makes loan sharks and payday loan people look like anti-usury angels.
[00:24:16.087 --> 00:24:17.267]  People want prosperity.
[00:24:17.487 --> 00:24:21.688]  We know in the industrialized age, we should be working three days a week and living like kings.
[00:24:22.528 --> 00:24:26.109]  They were being told the more robots and more automation there is, the more we've got to work.
[00:24:26.489 --> 00:24:31.390]  It's all been actuaried and all set up to make us as poor and stupid as possible.
[00:24:33.651 --> 00:24:36.111]  And it's called Agenda 21, and it's all right there.
[00:24:37.131 --> 00:24:42.933]  You can't have a car, you can't have an air conditioner, Obama said as he walked off a jumbo jet, and he told the Africans.
[00:24:43.613 --> 00:24:44.953]  Hypocrisy writ large.
[00:24:48.632 --> 00:25:09.519]  And Mr. Wilders, over there, a member of the Dutch Parliament, I had in a lot of the polls when he runs for president, a panel of three judges ruled the Freedom Party leaders' comments in a post-election speech in 2014 were demeaning and thereby insulting towards Moroccan population when he said, we're bringing in these Moroccans and a lot of them are criminals!
[00:25:11.219 --> 00:25:16.841]  Yeah, well, they've got court cases going on against Marine Le Pen, who's leading a lot of polls for president in France.
[00:25:18.148 --> 00:25:24.312]  Because she said, we haven't faced such a threat to our sovereignty since the Nazis in World War II.
[00:25:24.673 --> 00:25:25.473]  Yeah, I'd say so.
[00:25:26.514 --> 00:25:28.015]  Islam conquered Spain.
[00:25:29.276 --> 00:25:32.578]  Islam sure conquered what's Turkey today.
[00:25:32.598 --> 00:25:34.440]  Islam went all the way into Poland.
[00:25:36.361 --> 00:25:41.505]  That's why the Polish and Romanian-Hungarian girls got those sexy eyes.
[00:25:43.326 --> 00:25:46.208]  Because there was a lot of raping went on, and a lot of killing.
[00:25:47.418 --> 00:25:48.919]  The men got put on slave galleys.
[00:25:49.199 --> 00:25:57.163]  But again, it's fun to get put on a slave galley and have everybody killed but the women because it's Islam, so it's okay.
[00:25:57.183 --> 00:26:00.685]  It's okay to have the imams, the head imam.
[00:26:01.934 --> 00:26:05.177]  Israel, and Jerusalem, and all the other big Imams.
[00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:07.479]  Openly, I mean, it's like a cartoon.
[00:26:07.979 --> 00:26:16.466]  It's translated into English, but it's like... It sounds like Klingon.
[00:26:17.247 --> 00:26:18.988]  And it's like, you are weak, Americans!
[00:26:19.008 --> 00:26:20.009]  You are weak, Europeans!
[00:26:20.169 --> 00:26:21.130]  Your women are ours!
[00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.852]  We will take them before we kill you first!
[00:26:24.412 --> 00:26:25.093]  You pigs!
[00:26:28.177 --> 00:26:39.185]  All the weird, trendy liberals, we played the different UN ads they run in Germany, where it shows the German Newsy star dancing around going, I wear the hijab, I love it, you wear it too, we submit, they'd be nice.
[00:26:41.087 --> 00:26:46.431]  You bring in something incompatible to a free society, the Bastion of Liberty of the West that's
[00:26:47.903 --> 00:27:02.935]  Emancipated the slaves, freed the women, all of it, the West, the West, demonize it, bring in folks that created the African slave trade, and then get the black folks to all become black Muslims and actually join the group that basically invented the modern slave trade.
[00:27:03.215 --> 00:27:05.017]  I mean, that's genius, isn't it?
[00:27:05.777 --> 00:27:08.558]  And then, when you don't want to embrace that, they call you anti-Islam.
[00:27:08.778 --> 00:27:09.819]  Well, I'm anti-Nazi.
[00:27:10.039 --> 00:27:11.479]  I think the Nazi culture was bad.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:16.301]  I'm anti-Aztec, where they would sacrifice people every single day and cut their hearts out.
[00:27:16.542 --> 00:27:17.482]  Oh, it's just a culture.
[00:27:17.662 --> 00:27:19.143]  Well, then the Nazis are just a culture.
[00:27:21.384 --> 00:27:22.584]  No, it's not just a culture.
[00:27:22.904 --> 00:27:26.926]  Oh, was Genghis Khan just a culture, where they'd ride through and murder everyone, but again, the women?
[00:27:27.984 --> 00:27:29.866]  And just come to your town and kill everybody?
[00:27:30.206 --> 00:27:31.267]  And stick you on poles?
[00:27:31.587 --> 00:27:32.368]  And slit your throat?
[00:27:32.968 --> 00:27:34.309]  And drag you behind their chariots?
[00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:35.731]  Or drag you behind their horses?
[00:27:37.252 --> 00:27:38.253]  Oh, it's just a culture!
[00:27:38.493 --> 00:27:39.594]  It's just a culture!
[00:27:40.635 --> 00:27:41.816]  No one should have any culture.
[00:27:41.836 --> 00:27:43.017]  Just give up your culture!
[00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:46.420]  Ask the Muslims how it is.
[00:27:47.781 --> 00:27:50.303]  Hundreds of thousands of Muslims killed every year by Muslims.
[00:27:51.164 --> 00:27:54.607]  I want to reform Islam like we reformed Christianity.
[00:27:56.732 --> 00:27:59.193]  Christianity did a lot of barbarous things in the name of Christianity.
[00:27:59.573 --> 00:28:01.734]  Let's just admit the Inquisitions weren't good.
[00:28:02.334 --> 00:28:06.895]  Let's just admit if people didn't convert to Christianity in some parts of the world, people were put to the sword.
[00:28:07.336 --> 00:28:08.956]  Islam's way worse than that!
[00:28:09.256 --> 00:28:16.218]  Completely out of control, and everyone's supposed to tiptoe around it and kiss its big, fat, stinking butt, and then everything's gonna be okay.
[00:28:16.439 --> 00:28:17.439]  It's not gonna be okay.
[00:28:20.779 --> 00:28:36.647]  Here, put it behind me, the truck of peace, that has nothing to do with Islam, running over people, and if you talk about it, they have the former Stasi hired, you can't make that up, in Germany, to kick you off Facebook, or fine, or fee you, and the police come to your house.
[00:28:37.228 --> 00:28:46.473]  And then, from Sweden, to Germany, to the Netherlands, the police are told, make it up, when women get raped en masse, and say, Swedes, or Dutch, or Germans did it.
[00:28:46.693 --> 00:28:48.434]  And they actually get caught doing it!
[00:28:51.668 --> 00:28:54.270]  All this mental patient cuckolding.
[00:28:54.831 --> 00:28:58.794]  This mental patient, Harry Carey, commits suicide as a culture.
[00:28:59.475 --> 00:29:04.299]  This death wish, this weird, sniveling, let's kill ourselves culture.
[00:29:05.916 --> 00:29:07.197]  Let's hate ourselves, culture!
[00:29:07.377 --> 00:29:15.781]  And the weird socialist leftists, in competition with the West, and the engine of liberty, and the engine of prosperity, pissed that collectivism can't compete with it.
[00:29:16.361 --> 00:29:22.724]  So collectivism's now hijacked it, milking it, and then wants to gut the engine of freedom because they feel so...
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:24.741]  Weak next to it.
[00:29:25.161 --> 00:29:28.244]  Imagine, the globalists and the socialists have got the whole West.
[00:29:28.304 --> 00:29:28.884]  It's theirs now.
[00:29:29.304 --> 00:29:40.454]  They want to gut it, burn it to the ground, and then bring in a bunch of third world cavemen that keep women with chains and wear hoods over their heads in, like freaking space aliens or something, to conquer us.
[00:29:40.834 --> 00:29:46.899]  And then just run around pissing all over everything in some giant territory marking event.
[00:29:50.073 --> 00:29:50.494]  Whoa!
[00:29:50.674 --> 00:29:52.296]  What a group of freaks!
[00:29:52.897 --> 00:29:56.201]  What a group of mental patients who, again, mommy and daddy gave them everything.
[00:29:56.441 --> 00:30:02.369]  They're the most spoiled people on earth, the modern trendy, and they just want to blow everything up and crap all over it as soon as possible.
[00:30:02.769 --> 00:30:03.190]  We'll be back.
[00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:03.510]  Stay with us.
[00:30:10.083 --> 00:30:13.864]  Look at this nonsense from Darlene Superville of the Associated Press.
[00:30:14.104 --> 00:30:17.525]  Headline reads, Trump blames terrorists for killing in Turkey.
[00:30:17.705 --> 00:30:28.308]  Trump on Monday experienced what life will be like as president as he condemned separate deadly incidents against a Russian diplomat and shoppers at a German Christmas market, blaming Islamic terrorism in both instances.
[00:30:28.508 --> 00:30:30.649]  Finally, a president who calls it like it is.
[00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:32.890]  But wait, that's not how Darlene feels.
[00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:37.931]  She says, he offered no support for his claims that terrorists were responsible for the carnage.
[00:30:38.231 --> 00:30:38.891]  What, what, what?
[00:30:39.372 --> 00:30:41.333]  What world are you living in, Darlene?
[00:30:41.713 --> 00:30:45.876]  The shooter literally said Allahu Akbar and said he did this for jihad.
[00:30:46.076 --> 00:30:50.599]  And what other incidents do we know of where crowds of people are run over by a truck?
[00:30:50.819 --> 00:30:58.364]  If 120 people were in a burning building and Trump saved 119 of them, Darlene would write a story saying Trump kills one in structure fire.
[00:30:58.524 --> 00:31:02.967]  This is just like when they scolded Trump for referencing a bomb in New York back in September.
[00:31:03.087 --> 00:31:05.328]  Well, he was right then, and he is right now.
[00:31:05.649 --> 00:31:06.489]  Sorry, Darlene.
[00:31:06.689 --> 00:31:09.171]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:10.292 --> 00:31:12.113]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[00:31:13.794 --> 00:31:19.478]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:24.081]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:31:25.026 --> 00:31:27.227]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:31:27.307 --> 00:31:28.468]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:31:28.488 --> 00:31:31.729]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:33.030]  Or more.
[00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.031]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:31:35.551 --> 00:31:37.032]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:31:37.132 --> 00:31:40.494]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:31:40.574 --> 00:31:42.335]  It's actually scary.
[00:31:43.235 --> 00:31:53.320]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:31:54.321 --> 00:32:07.127]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[00:32:09.932 --> 00:32:11.293]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:32:11.593 --> 00:32:12.874]  You can't survive without it.
[00:32:13.074 --> 00:32:13.974]  But where do you get it?
[00:32:14.274 --> 00:32:20.038]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:32:20.258 --> 00:32:25.981]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:32:26.181 --> 00:32:43.045]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:32:43.425 --> 00:32:45.566]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:32:45.906 --> 00:32:47.106]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:32:47.386 --> 00:32:48.066]  Easy assembly.
[00:32:48.427 --> 00:32:49.047]  Low maintenance.
[00:32:49.347 --> 00:32:51.167]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:33:16.636 --> 00:33:17.376]  Big Brother.
[00:33:18.737 --> 00:33:20.018]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:21.498 --> 00:33:22.659]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.080]  Do you want answers?
[00:33:26.041 --> 00:33:27.021]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:27.942 --> 00:33:34.345]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:51.795 --> 00:33:54.877]  We've got Vice here doing a documentary for HBO.
[00:33:56.518 --> 00:33:58.199]  And he's one of the pretty smart guys.
[00:33:58.619 --> 00:34:00.301]  He's one of their only libertarian producers.
[00:34:00.321 --> 00:34:01.341]  Seems like a pretty fair fella.
[00:34:02.022 --> 00:34:04.743]  He was saying during the break, he goes, why do you stabilize the Middle East?
[00:34:04.804 --> 00:34:08.226]  Well, Wesley Clark, about six, seven years ago came out.
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.820]  There's two different interviews.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.361]  One was about eight years ago, and one was about seven years ago.
[00:34:13.941 --> 00:34:14.961]  Two different TV interviews.
[00:34:15.402 --> 00:34:17.422]  We've played it probably 500 times, I'm serious.
[00:34:17.902 --> 00:34:18.862]  But I guess we could play it again.
[00:34:18.882 --> 00:34:25.564]  And he says, listen, I was at the Pentagon shortly after I left in 2001.
[00:34:25.604 --> 00:34:32.506]  And they had all these battle plans on the wall, the next seven countries in the Middle East and North Africa to take out.
[00:34:33.126 --> 00:34:35.707]  And the plan was to use basically the jihadis to do it.
[00:34:36.943 --> 00:34:41.006]  And then to come in and then clean it up later, if that ever was even done.
[00:34:41.026 --> 00:34:44.348]  And the plan is population reduction, population control.
[00:34:45.688 --> 00:34:49.010]  And so, we are doing horrible things to the people in the Middle East.
[00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.531]  Let's be clear.
[00:34:50.438 --> 00:34:51.939]  People say, well, you're against wars.
[00:34:51.979 --> 00:34:53.381]  You say you don't want to invade the Middle East.
[00:34:53.421 --> 00:34:56.283]  You say that all the Muslims aren't bad, but then you're demonizing Islam.
[00:34:56.343 --> 00:34:57.184]  Alex, what's the point?
[00:34:57.764 --> 00:34:59.145]  It's more sophisticated than that.
[00:34:59.165 --> 00:35:10.555]  Why do you think Hamid Gul, before he died, the former head of Pakistani intelligence, the guy that basically defeated the Russians in Afghanistan in the 80s with Reagan, why do you think he would come on the show, even though I was critical of a lot of Islam?
[00:35:11.016 --> 00:35:16.700]  Because he knew that I was actually covering the fact that the Islamic countries are being set up for destruction long term.
[00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:21.943]  But the West is being set up for destruction as well, as the globalists play us off against each other.
[00:35:22.883 --> 00:35:25.504]  You bring them in, they attack, they kill.
[00:35:26.304 --> 00:35:31.246]  Then the media says, and the government says, we've got to conform and not stir up Islam.
[00:35:31.566 --> 00:35:35.588]  We've got to pass anti-free speech laws so you don't cause them to attack us.
[00:35:36.328 --> 00:35:37.448]  They call it incitement.
[00:35:38.429 --> 00:35:46.972]  Well, how did they convict Gert Wilders, Member of Parliament, way up in the polls, could end up being their new leader.
[00:35:48.749 --> 00:35:49.830]  They say he's inciting.
[00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:50.890]  He's being mean racially.
[00:35:51.951 --> 00:35:53.312]  And they're saying the same thing here now.
[00:35:53.992 --> 00:35:56.314]  They're telling German women, don't wear short skirts.
[00:35:56.414 --> 00:35:57.895]  You've got to conform to Islam now.
[00:35:58.855 --> 00:36:02.657]  They're installing mayors and major leaders of German cities.
[00:36:02.697 --> 00:36:05.119]  The Secretary of State of the state of Berlin.
[00:36:05.859 --> 00:36:06.520]  That's how German is.
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.881]  It's little states, not counties.
[00:36:09.341 --> 00:36:18.247]  She is a woman who doesn't wear a hijab or a burqa, but she says women should, and gets up on TV and calls for Sharia law in Germany.
[00:36:19.878 --> 00:36:27.202]  And again, one of the few things I was wrong about is ten years ago, I'd hear all this talk about a new caliphate, a new Sharia law takeover, and I'd roll my eyes.
[00:36:27.743 --> 00:36:30.264]  I'd say, you right-wingers, you are really pushing garbage.
[00:36:30.584 --> 00:36:35.167]  There's no way the liberal West will bring all this in and let these people actually dictate to us.
[00:36:35.587 --> 00:36:46.494]  But we don't need to be in the Middle East, stirring it all up, and throwing out Saddam to put Wahhabis in control, when it's Saudi Arabia that was clearly more involved in 9-11 than anybody else.
[00:36:47.394 --> 00:36:48.375]  And Saddam's their enemy.
[00:36:50.197 --> 00:36:51.418]  And look where we are now!
[00:36:52.858 --> 00:37:14.166]  So, it's a serious situation when the ambassador to Turkey gets killed from Russia, another ambassador, another diplomat gets killed in Moscow, Putin's best buddy and driver gets killed in a CIA-style hit, or they ram into him with a big truck, his favorite way to get you, you know, a reinforced truck.
[00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:16.487]  You've got all of this happening.
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:25.202]  You've got all of this unfolding, and clearly, this was all a highly scripted, prepared event.
[00:37:25.342 --> 00:37:26.222]  The killing was real.
[00:37:27.063 --> 00:37:31.184]  Notice the art that's hanging right behind him when he gets killed at this government-sponsored art show.
[00:37:31.704 --> 00:37:34.065]  It's a cannon pointed right at you.
[00:37:34.145 --> 00:37:35.165]  It's a message to everybody.
[00:37:37.066 --> 00:37:38.266]  This is a message to Russia.
[00:37:38.967 --> 00:37:40.347]  We can script anything we want.
[00:37:40.367 --> 00:37:42.148]  We will kill you in front of everybody.
[00:37:42.948 --> 00:37:48.870]  That is a direct message like wrapping two fish in a body armor of Luca Brasi in The Godfather.
[00:37:49.804 --> 00:37:50.724]  It sleeps with the fishes.
[00:37:53.146 --> 00:38:06.412]  It's like telling everybody there'll be no autopsy when it's first announced that Scalia died a few hours ago, and then having him be part of some secret society meeting and telling you he was part of it, and then saying he was found with a pillow on his face.
[00:38:08.213 --> 00:38:09.034]  That was a message.
[00:38:09.414 --> 00:38:12.916]  You get in line, other Supreme Court justices, or you're dead.
[00:38:12.936 --> 00:38:19.259]  And by the way, I have that from Supreme Court justices, that I'm absolutely right about the death threats.
[00:38:21.189 --> 00:38:24.591]  But see, the whole takeover failed, didn't it?
[00:38:25.892 --> 00:38:28.214]  And now, who gets to talk to the President?
[00:38:28.614 --> 00:38:30.495]  Who gets to talk to Supreme Court Justices?
[00:38:31.076 --> 00:38:32.817]  Matt Drudge, Alex Jones.
[00:38:35.359 --> 00:38:37.000]  And it totally is pissing them off.
[00:38:38.121 --> 00:38:48.509]  30 days out, they will do anything, including starting wars, assassinating Trump, you name it, they will do anything they can.
[00:38:48.529 --> 00:38:58.116]  Because I don't get up here and brag about the fact that we've now become the talking points memo for the intelligence agencies, for the military, for the president-elect.
[00:38:58.176 --> 00:39:01.559]  And it's not because we just made all this up.
[00:39:02.399 --> 00:39:04.761]  And they hear it, and then believe it.
[00:39:05.141 --> 00:39:07.083]  They already know this and more!
[00:39:09.605 --> 00:39:14.269]  They just can't release classified information, so they say, listen to Alex Jones.
[00:39:14.689 --> 00:39:15.930]  He knows what's going on.
[00:39:17.091 --> 00:39:20.994]  And I'm not given classified information most of the time over the years.
[00:39:21.675 --> 00:39:23.316]  Certainly not from the sources I just mentioned.
[00:39:24.057 --> 00:39:25.678]  I already know how it works.
[00:39:25.998 --> 00:39:27.560]  I've reverse-engineered the whole thing.
[00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:33.011]  And we've got a better handle on how this works than pretty much anybody who's public.
[00:39:34.931 --> 00:39:36.592]  Are there analysts that know more than I do?
[00:39:36.752 --> 00:39:37.312]  Absolutely.
[00:39:37.572 --> 00:39:39.112]  Are there all sorts of people smarter than I am?
[00:39:39.332 --> 00:39:39.612]  Yes.
[00:39:40.013 --> 00:39:42.553]  But nobody went and built a media operation to talk about it.
[00:39:43.773 --> 00:39:46.574]  So I want listeners to understand, you're not getting my opinion here.
[00:39:46.614 --> 00:39:50.295]  You're not getting speculation 95% of the time.
[00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:55.576]  When I'm speculating, I'm very clear about the fact that we're speculating.
[00:39:57.506 --> 00:40:00.448]  And I make a demarcation line on that fact.
[00:40:01.209 --> 00:40:14.258]  But are jihadis stabbing and shooting and murdering and attacking military bases and attacking Christmas parties and attacking Army, Navy, Marine Corps recruiting centers and attacking public schools and colleges and police officers?
[00:40:14.978 --> 00:40:19.141]  None of us even know the names of the record number of cops killed last year.
[00:40:19.161 --> 00:40:21.303]  It's not a butt-kissing operation of the police.
[00:40:21.963 --> 00:40:23.185]  But that's my front line.
[00:40:23.225 --> 00:40:24.006]  That's my country.
[00:40:24.346 --> 00:40:39.686]  Whether my country's perfect or not, outside globalist forces that overthrew Ukraine with anti-police riots three years ago are trying to cause an anti-police riot in this country as a grassroots revolution to destabilize local government so there can be a federal emergency.
[00:40:43.131 --> 00:40:54.177]  But the whole Soros operation that worked in the Middle East, that worked in Eastern Europe, isn't working here because we knew what your plan was and they've been exposing it before you ever did it here.
[00:40:56.178 --> 00:40:58.440]  We know you run the same type of operations.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:40:59.881]  We know who you are.
[00:40:59.981 --> 00:41:01.221]  We're watching you.
[00:41:01.241 --> 00:41:03.883]  And you say, well, we're watching you and we'll get you.
[00:41:04.523 --> 00:41:06.204]  We already know that, dumbass.
[00:41:06.484 --> 00:41:07.285]  Fill your hand.
[00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:20.278]  I love how they threaten us all the time, behind the scenes, officially threatening us, demonizing, saying, one more thing, one more thing, Jones, one more time, back off, back off, back off.
[00:41:21.659 --> 00:41:23.360]  I already know you're killers.
[00:41:23.501 --> 00:41:24.681]  I already know you're scum.
[00:41:24.882 --> 00:41:27.264]  That's why I'm fighting you and risking my life.
[00:41:27.984 --> 00:41:34.870]  Because you death threat me, because you attack me, because you demonize this country and try to destroy it and hurt poor people.
[00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.512]  You're in a death battle now.
[00:41:39.056 --> 00:41:41.037]  You're in a death battle, New World Order!
[00:41:41.278 --> 00:41:41.958]  We know!
[00:41:42.318 --> 00:41:43.479]  You're in one with us!
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.060]  Comprende?
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:46.301]  Comprehended?
[00:41:46.521 --> 00:41:48.943]  You're in a death battle!
[00:41:50.538 --> 00:41:55.020]  We don't care what you say, what you do, how you lie, what wars you start.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.761]  We're coming for you.
[00:41:57.141 --> 00:41:58.702]  Because you won't get off of us.
[00:41:59.002 --> 00:42:04.644]  You're sitting on our chest, suffocating us, and we are flailing instinctively.
[00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:06.005]  We're rising.
[00:42:06.365 --> 00:42:08.266]  We're getting you off our back right now.
[00:42:08.886 --> 00:42:10.347]  We've just pulled you off our back.
[00:42:10.627 --> 00:42:11.807]  We've got you in our hands.
[00:42:12.007 --> 00:42:15.069]  You're snapping, you're clawing, you're biting, you're trying to get loose.
[00:42:16.348 --> 00:42:18.789]  And we're just flipping the switch, going, we're never turning loose.
[00:42:19.229 --> 00:42:20.209]  We're never turning loose.
[00:42:20.229 --> 00:42:42.354]  And inexorably, inexorably, politically, we're not looking for vengeance, but politically, you feel our hands now, as you claw at us, as our arms bleed, just wrap our hands around your evil, crooked, stinking, wart-covered, scrofulous, dripping neck.
[00:42:44.648 --> 00:42:45.829]  You can feel it, don't you?
[00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:50.812]  The oxygen leaving your brain, the panic as we bear down on you.
[00:42:51.793 --> 00:42:55.435]  For America, for the children, for innocents, you feel it, don't you?
[00:42:55.916 --> 00:42:59.258]  You wanted to dominate us, now you get destroyed!
[00:43:01.139 --> 00:43:05.982]  Doesn't matter what happens to the missiles that slam into your ass.
[00:43:09.565 --> 00:43:11.446]  I'm a weapon, I'm made to be thrown at you.
[00:43:13.208 --> 00:43:15.989]  If I make it through this, I'll just be old and die.
[00:43:16.009 --> 00:43:19.570]  An old man's death in my sleep.
[00:43:20.391 --> 00:43:24.933]  Why not die the real fight with a sword in my hand while I'm still young and strong?
[00:43:26.233 --> 00:43:27.474]  Selfish part of me doesn't want that.
[00:43:27.514 --> 00:43:28.354]  I don't have any death wish.
[00:43:28.394 --> 00:43:29.154]  I want to live forever.
[00:43:29.895 --> 00:43:33.836]  If I ever supposedly commit suicide, you know it's a lie, but I'm not afraid.
[00:43:34.196 --> 00:43:37.437]  I've stepped into destiny against you.
[00:43:37.798 --> 00:43:41.179]  And so is the rest of humanity now, stepping into destiny.
[00:43:42.659 --> 00:43:49.188]  Now, let me get into the news in a bunch of clips because Roger Stone has been working, I'm talking 20 hours a day, finishing this big book.
[00:43:49.588 --> 00:43:50.390]  He was going to be on today.
[00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:51.171]  He's under the weather.
[00:43:51.191 --> 00:43:52.552]  I'm going to try to get him on tomorrow.
[00:43:53.454 --> 00:43:55.617]  But we do have some other guests joining us today.
[00:43:55.637 --> 00:43:56.938]  I'll tell you about coming up in the next segment.
[00:43:56.978 --> 00:43:59.362]  But let me just go ahead and start breaking down the news here.
[00:44:02.062 --> 00:44:04.403]  We just saw an exercise in media control.
[00:44:04.443 --> 00:44:14.447]  They use these events as a laboratory, as a test case, on how to first say it was a driverless car, or no one was seen in it, or we don't know who did it, or maybe it was an accident.
[00:44:15.487 --> 00:44:21.930]  But now they would do that before for days or even weeks, saying San Bernardino wasn't a terror attack, and the FBI came out and said they were ordered to lie about it.
[00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:24.351]  They were also ordered to stand down and not go after the guy.
[00:44:24.731 --> 00:44:27.352]  Imagine being at a Christmas party with your
[00:44:28.703 --> 00:44:33.685]  Fellow office folks, some are atheists, some are Christians, some are Jews.
[00:44:35.205 --> 00:44:42.167]  And the Islamicists admittedly sought out the folks they killed in San Bernardino at the office party at the health department, Jews and Christians.
[00:44:43.428 --> 00:44:43.928]  And they killed them.
[00:44:46.369 --> 00:44:50.750]  And they said it's not a racial component to Islam, but we're always continuing to see that there is.
[00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:53.691]  An anti-Jew, anti-Christian sentiment.
[00:44:56.274 --> 00:44:59.476]  And it's all the big cause celeb in the leftist movement to be anti-semitic.
[00:45:00.237 --> 00:45:04.400]  I just see Israel as a very diverse group and don't sit there and put labels on it.
[00:45:06.581 --> 00:45:11.364]  But again, all the race baiting, all the race pushing by the left is really sick, folks.
[00:45:12.085 --> 00:45:14.987]  And it's everything they claim they're trying to fight back against.
[00:45:15.007 --> 00:45:16.648]  That's what's so disgusting about it.
[00:45:18.649 --> 00:45:19.310]  But meanwhile,
[00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:26.893]  We have this horrific event taking place in Berlin with 12 people dead.
[00:45:28.974 --> 00:45:36.379]  I want to play a report by Paul Joseph Watson that's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that needs to go viral.
[00:45:36.779 --> 00:45:39.400]  Russian ambassador shot dead.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.762]  What they're not telling you, that's coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:45:42.082 --> 00:45:45.664]  We're going to air the truth about Berlin Christmas market attack.
[00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:51.787]  Now, we now have the media coming out saying it's the fault of right-wingers.
[00:45:52.227 --> 00:45:56.494]  They weren't inclusive enough of Islam, and that's why this happened.
[00:45:56.514 --> 00:45:57.075]  Here's the report.
[00:45:57.898 --> 00:46:04.964]  How many trucks need to be ploughed through innocent people before we acknowledge that Islam is not a religion of peace?
[00:46:05.064 --> 00:46:07.926]  But this is just a truck crash, says CNN.
[00:46:08.106 --> 00:46:11.369]  Not an attack and definitely nothing to do with Islam.
[00:46:11.409 --> 00:46:15.832]  While according to the BBC, a lorry was to blame for the attack.
[00:46:15.992 --> 00:46:17.093]  Give me a break.
[00:46:17.273 --> 00:46:25.660]  How many terror attacks do we need to see in Germany before Angela Merkel reverses her disastrous open-door migrant policy?
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.101]  This wasn't hard to predict.
[00:46:27.401 --> 00:46:31.427]  I said nearly a month ago that Christmas markets in Europe would be attacked.
[00:46:31.487 --> 00:46:34.111]  This is an attack on Christianity itself.
[00:46:34.351 --> 00:46:36.414]  So what's Germany going to do about it?
[00:46:36.754 --> 00:46:37.675]  Ban trucks?
[00:46:38.116 --> 00:46:40.099]  Erect barriers around everything?
[00:46:40.199 --> 00:46:42.863]  How about not importing terrorists?
[00:46:43.103 --> 00:46:48.725]  Just last week, a 12-year-old ISIS-supporting boy tried to bomb a Christmas market in Germany.
[00:46:48.765 --> 00:46:52.126]  Germany suffered Islamic terror attacks throughout the summer.
[00:46:52.206 --> 00:46:58.547]  All this after around 1.5 million almost entirely Muslim migrants arrived in the country.
[00:46:58.667 --> 00:47:00.548]  Is that just a coincidence?
[00:47:00.748 --> 00:47:06.276]  Multiculturalism has clearly failed and now poses a direct threat to the German people.
[00:47:06.377 --> 00:47:13.267]  But for the past 18 months, the German government has been brainwashing its people to accept multiculturalism.
[00:47:16.065 --> 00:47:17.486]  Me too!
[00:47:18.186 --> 00:47:19.527]  It's pretty, isn't it?
[00:47:19.567 --> 00:47:21.968]  Enjoy difference, start tolerance.
[00:47:22.448 --> 00:47:30.171]  While Christmas songs at Christmas markets in Germany broadcast live on television, get Islamic makeovers.
[00:47:30.391 --> 00:47:32.232]  She really celebrates multiculturalism.
[00:47:36.254 --> 00:47:50.861]  But in advance of next year's election, Angela Merkel still enjoys support from the majority of the German people, despite her saying there will be no cap on Muslim refugees flooding into the country.
[00:47:51.601 --> 00:47:54.842]  402,000 extra crimes committed by migrants since last year.
[00:47:54.962 --> 00:47:59.523]  Mass molestations of women, rapes and murders occurring on a regular basis.
[00:47:59.663 --> 00:48:06.444]  Multiculturalism has clearly failed, but the majority of Germans still have their heads stuck in the sand.
[00:48:06.564 --> 00:48:07.585]  What's it going to take?
[00:48:07.685 --> 00:48:15.186]  How many innocent men, women and children need to be slaughtered in the streets before we address the root cause?
[00:48:15.226 --> 00:48:18.627]  You're not going to prevent this by banning the burqa.
[00:48:19.307 --> 00:48:21.890]  Stop importing terrorists.
[00:48:22.311 --> 00:48:23.933]  That's how you prevent it.
[00:48:24.013 --> 00:48:30.080]  Stop importing an ideology that ghettoizes and then becomes a wellspring for other terrorists.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.143]  We condemn the attacks in Ankara, Berlin and Zurich.
[00:48:32.223 --> 00:48:35.347]  However, we also condemn the Islamophobia it brings along.
[00:48:35.547 --> 00:48:37.209]  Terrorism has no religion.
[00:48:37.329 --> 00:48:38.530]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:42.333]  That attitude is why Germany is in serious trouble.
[00:48:42.433 --> 00:48:46.976]  The main suspect in the attack is either from Pakistan or Afghanistan.
[00:48:47.416 --> 00:48:48.897]  Pakistan is 98% Muslim.
[00:48:48.977 --> 00:48:50.158]  Afghanistan is 99% Muslim.
[00:48:54.361 --> 00:48:55.862]  Some kind of connection there.
[00:48:55.963 --> 00:48:57.584]  Can't quite put my finger on it.
[00:48:57.644 --> 00:49:06.912]  You're not going to stop this by waffling on about Islamophobia, blaming a truck, or any other kind of Stockholm Syndrome ostrich behavior.
[00:49:06.952 --> 00:49:10.916]  You're going to stop it by not importing a terrorist ideology.
[00:49:10.996 --> 00:49:19.464]  And if Angela Merkel refuses to do that, then she needs to resign now and step aside for somebody who will.
[00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:25.052]  That powerful report is on Infowars.com.
[00:49:25.092 --> 00:49:26.793]  I'm going to retweet that right now.
[00:49:27.653 --> 00:49:30.455]  Another one of his reports coming up that's just as informative.
[00:49:31.496 --> 00:49:38.160]  For those that don't know, they don't allow you in at least 13 Islamic countries to be anything but a Muslim if you live there.
[00:49:39.201 --> 00:49:50.310]  Okay, so it's the most backwards, intolerant garbage in the world except for North Korea, where they keep most humans as basically like barnyard animals.
[00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:53.352]  But it's okay because it has Democratic in its name and it's real liberal.
[00:49:54.605 --> 00:49:59.891]  And they've got all these weird restaurants all over where liberals go and celebrate Mao and all this crap.
[00:49:59.951 --> 00:50:02.014]  I mean, you people are freaks, man.
[00:50:02.054 --> 00:50:05.418]  Your parents spoiled you so bad that you want to just overturn it all.
[00:50:05.458 --> 00:50:07.681]  You're wanting somebody to set you straight.
[00:50:07.701 --> 00:50:08.482]  It's like criminology.
[00:50:08.922 --> 00:50:10.924]  When psychopaths, you know, get away with killing.
[00:50:11.957 --> 00:50:15.580]  They start getting sloppier and sloppier and sending notes to the cops and trying to get caught.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:21.624]  Well, the average trendy in this spoiled rotten country is just begging reality to slap them upside the face.
[00:50:22.505 --> 00:50:37.717]  As they beg to overturn the First Amendment, as they beg to overturn the alt-right media, as they openly call, I played this last week, on every major network on cable, even Fox, calls for shutting me up and then play edited tapes of stuff out of context.
[00:50:38.635 --> 00:50:41.958]  I'm like, Hillary's behind the mass murder, personally, under logs when she orders it.
[00:50:42.299 --> 00:50:45.882]  Murder of Christians and raping and killing of kids in Syria.
[00:50:46.163 --> 00:50:50.447]  They cut the Syria off and cut to saying she's murdering people in a pizza place.
[00:50:51.288 --> 00:50:54.751]  I mean, this is how they deceive people, and it's why they don't have any support.
[00:50:55.892 --> 00:50:58.094]  So good luck banning us, good luck trying to shut us down.
[00:50:59.055 --> 00:51:02.279]  Now I want to get more into this when we come back, also what's happening
[00:51:03.536 --> 00:51:07.653]  In Turkey and Syria, because in the next 30 days, Obama's gonna try to start a big war with Russia.
[00:51:08.034 --> 00:51:08.396]  Stay with us.
[00:51:14.315 --> 00:51:15.356]  You've studied communists.
[00:51:15.376 --> 00:51:17.017]  You've gone deep into how they operate.
[00:51:17.457 --> 00:51:22.681]  You know, you interviewed, of course, and so have we, the late, great Larry Grafwald that went inside the Weatherman operations.
[00:51:23.661 --> 00:51:24.662]  What makes them tick?
[00:51:24.842 --> 00:51:28.464]  Why do they hate this country and prosperity so much?
[00:51:29.605 --> 00:51:35.649]  Leftist progressives have a passion for destruction that is only equaled by the Islamists.
[00:51:35.869 --> 00:51:37.651]  The Islamists and the progressives
[00:51:38.351 --> 00:51:44.134]  Have that thing in common, that they both want to destroy the existing order and rebuild society from scratch.
[00:51:45.015 --> 00:51:57.262]  Us conservatives, or just what we call, where I come from in Tennessee, we just call it normal folks, we look at America and we look at the world and we say America is the greatest country that ever has been and we're so happy to be American, we're so happy.
[00:51:57.982 --> 00:52:03.005]  Leftists look at America and compare it to the perfect society, the perfect utopia.
[00:52:03.525 --> 00:52:10.048]  And they conclude, it's not perfect so we have to tear it down and destroy it and rebuild it from scratch and we're very unhappy.
[00:52:10.729 --> 00:52:19.353]  I just don't get how you're in charge, the system's made you the president, record numbers of whites have voted for you, and then you say it's a white lash when Trump gets elected.
[00:52:19.573 --> 00:52:20.474]  It's just pure crap.
[00:52:20.754 --> 00:52:25.496]  Well their ideology is to use people and use groups to take power.
[00:52:25.536 --> 00:52:28.418]  Not to take power to help people, but to use them.
[00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:31.260]  And communist ideology admits they're exploitive.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.180]  It's so cold-blooded.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:32.660]  Right.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.802]  They used urban America, the black people.
[00:52:35.682 --> 00:52:37.063]  Black lives never mattered to them.
[00:52:37.083 --> 00:52:38.064]  Black's vote mattered.
[00:52:38.244 --> 00:52:39.985]  But what's going on with the Islamicists?
[00:52:40.505 --> 00:52:41.606]  What are they looking for?
[00:52:41.866 --> 00:52:48.510]  The idea of Islam is that one day we'll control the entire world and only then will the world reach salvation.
[00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:52.472]  Therefore, Islam does not recognize borders or individual countries.
[00:52:53.493 --> 00:52:54.354]  After World War I,
[00:52:55.134 --> 00:52:59.236]  The European powers divided the Islamic world into individual nation-states.
[00:53:00.116 --> 00:53:05.199]  The problem is that nation-states were a Christian solution to Christian problems.
[00:53:05.219 --> 00:53:05.979]  They never had those.
[00:53:05.999 --> 00:53:07.340]  It was just tribes murdering each other.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.042]  Well, it was one large Islamic-controlled caliphate.
[00:53:11.122 --> 00:53:11.982]  Ottoman Empire.
[00:53:12.002 --> 00:53:16.824]  Yeah, the Ottoman Empire, and before that with a single destiny to expand across the world.
[00:53:17.425 --> 00:53:20.126]  By dividing the Islamic world up into nation-states,
[00:53:20.746 --> 00:53:31.740]  It created a scenario where the Islamists felt they had to destroy the nation states, get rid of these autocrats and military leaders that were preventing them from their natural expansion.
[00:53:32.401 --> 00:53:37.087]  So the opposition, the Islamists... Wasn't that a natural divide and conquer, the early strategy to divide them up, Mr. Congressman?
[00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:46.671]  Uh, the Western powers certainly felt that by dividing them up and having certain alliances, they'd be able to prevent them from continuing to attack Europe as they had done historically.
[00:53:46.711 --> 00:53:50.913]  But now, the globalists, the Euro, is openly allied with them.
[00:53:51.533 --> 00:54:03.198]  Well now, I think it's more that the leftists see the Muslims and the Islamic world as natural allies with the mutual goal of destroying the Western order.
[00:54:11.624 --> 00:54:25.468]  You know, I was just thinking, we normally have a Christmas tree in studio, just to be politically incorrect, because we live in such a free country that the bizarre, fake, fascist left, the opposite of real liberals, are trying to bully people who don't even say happy holidays now.
[00:54:25.508 --> 00:54:26.809]  They're saying that can be offensive.
[00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:29.789]  How about you trying to restrict my free speech is offensive?
[00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:33.651]  And trying to tell kids all over the country don't hand out Christmas cards at school.
[00:54:34.071 --> 00:54:35.191]  You can do whatever you want.
[00:54:35.211 --> 00:54:38.012]  We're not supposed to have a state-sponsored religion, which I'm all for.
[00:54:39.692 --> 00:54:41.173]  That's what Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[00:54:42.574 --> 00:54:48.017]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:54:48.057 --> 00:54:49.117]  That's how the First Amendment begins.
[00:54:50.398 --> 00:54:55.380]  Well, Islam wants to come in and impose its Sharia law, which is the opposite of the Constitution.
[00:54:56.621 --> 00:54:59.902]  And I know Muslims were brought up in this, and it's your heritage, and you love it and everything.
[00:54:59.942 --> 00:55:00.403]  Here's the deal.
[00:55:01.223 --> 00:55:05.205]  I'm not gonna submit to the will of the Saudi Arabian version of Islam.
[00:55:05.845 --> 00:55:06.646]  It ain't gonna happen.
[00:55:08.086 --> 00:55:09.427]  I don't move to Saudi Arabia.
[00:55:09.927 --> 00:55:10.908]  If you're gonna move here,
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:14.361]  You understand you're not going to make me adopt it.
[00:55:14.401 --> 00:55:15.922]  It's not happening over my dead body.
[00:55:16.223 --> 00:55:16.623]  And I get it.
[00:55:16.663 --> 00:55:17.183]  That's the idea.
[00:55:17.203 --> 00:55:18.324]  Like, well, then we're going to kill you.
[00:55:18.544 --> 00:55:18.985]  I understand.
[00:55:19.005 --> 00:55:21.426]  I know you're the best.
[00:55:21.446 --> 00:55:24.528]  You're going to conquest me and stop killing each other all day then.
[00:55:24.749 --> 00:55:25.629]  What's your problem?
[00:55:29.012 --> 00:55:34.195]  But you think about Christmas and a bunch of French out at their national holiday, their Fourth of July.
[00:55:34.976 --> 00:55:35.776]  They get run over.
[00:55:36.016 --> 00:55:36.637]  They get killed.
[00:55:38.635 --> 00:55:41.497]  Little kids running, mommy being run over, they're being run over.
[00:55:42.017 --> 00:55:43.117]  It's all for the jihad.
[00:55:43.458 --> 00:55:44.338]  The media tries to cover it up.
[00:55:44.658 --> 00:55:58.226]  Now a bunch of people killed in Germany at a Christmas event, ran over a bunch of Christmas trees, plowed over a bunch of people, because the Christmas carols and the Christianity and the music mixed with the Germanic tannin bomb, just they couldn't handle it.
[00:56:02.508 --> 00:56:03.969]  And now the cover-up ensues.
[00:56:05.731 --> 00:56:13.136]  Let's play this clip of the Religion of Peace executing the Russian ambassador yesterday and screaming Allah Akbar!
[00:56:13.476 --> 00:56:14.137]  Allah Akbar!
[00:56:14.177 --> 00:56:14.577]  Here it is!
[00:56:14.597 --> 00:56:16.178]  Allah Akbar!
[00:56:16.198 --> 00:56:17.259]  Allah Akbar!
[00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:40.212]  Again, let's play that one more time.
[00:56:40.232 --> 00:56:42.495]  There's some jitters in that video, but let's play it.
[00:56:42.915 --> 00:56:52.484]  With audio.
[00:56:54.386 --> 00:56:54.887]  Is that us?
[00:56:54.927 --> 00:56:55.848]  Should we re-download that?
[00:56:55.868 --> 00:56:57.289]  Or is that on the original video?
[00:56:57.329 --> 00:56:57.890]  That jitters.
[00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:58.850]  People think I'm editing it.
[00:56:59.491 --> 00:57:00.052]  The original video.
[00:57:01.971 --> 00:57:03.711]  Well, I'd be jittery too if somebody was shooting at me.
[00:57:04.151 --> 00:57:11.893]  So, this is what's going on, and this is a religion where people are just happy to just run around and just shoot people on TV, do whatever, because it's honored.
[00:57:11.993 --> 00:57:13.173]  It's like a rock star.
[00:57:14.233 --> 00:57:22.535]  You know, Obama, obviously, the Saudi Arabians gave chemical weapons a few years ago to the jihadis to attack and blame Assad, but they couldn't help it.
[00:57:22.575 --> 00:57:27.196]  They wanted to scream Allah Akbar and show themselves launching the big chemical
[00:57:28.644 --> 00:57:29.685]  I don't know.
[00:57:45.074 --> 00:57:49.478]  Before I go any further, since last Friday we've had massive denial of service, bot attacks.
[00:57:50.279 --> 00:57:51.420]  They didn't get into the servers.
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:52.441]  The servers are safe.
[00:57:52.962 --> 00:57:53.522]  They're fine.
[00:57:53.542 --> 00:57:53.962]  They're good.
[00:57:53.982 --> 00:57:57.185]  We've got the same folks that do the servers for MasterCard and Visa.
[00:57:57.786 --> 00:58:00.669]  But they were able to shut down InfoWars again last night for a few hours.
[00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:03.271]  They tried to shut the shopping cart InfoWars store down.
[00:58:03.672 --> 00:58:05.754]  But despite that, people have supported us.
[00:58:06.334 --> 00:58:13.362]  Taking advantage of the free shipping, taking advantage up to 50% off Colloidal Silver, 33% off Brain Force, that's the big huge special right now.
[00:58:13.803 --> 00:58:17.527]  Now 20% more in the nootropic bottle when you order it.
[00:58:18.949 --> 00:58:24.715]  Other great products like Vitamin B12 of the organic type, methylcobalamin, massively absorbable under the tongue.
[00:58:26.018 --> 00:58:26.858]  Folks are into drugs.
[00:58:26.878 --> 00:58:27.479]  I don't know why.
[00:58:27.579 --> 00:58:28.659]  I'm into supplements.
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:31.381]  Real supplements are game-changing and amazing.
[00:58:31.401 --> 00:58:32.501]  That's why I've got so much energy.
[00:58:32.922 --> 00:58:34.182]  Huge specials running right now.
[00:58:34.342 --> 00:58:37.624]  Infowarslife.com is the supplement page.
[00:58:37.684 --> 00:58:41.426]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:58:41.446 --> 00:58:43.207]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:58:43.547 --> 00:58:46.668]  You can still order today and get it before Christmas in the lower 48.
[00:58:47.629 --> 00:58:48.890]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:50.230]  We'll tell you about the guests that are coming up.
[00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:50.691]  Stay with us.
[00:58:52.211 --> 00:58:53.452]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:55.021 --> 00:58:57.219]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.757 --> 00:59:05.640]  Facebook, Twitter, and Google have now been sued by families of the victims of the Orlando nightclub shootings.
[00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:11.983]  The families of three victims are teaming up and suing the platforms for allegedly providing material support to the Islamic State.
[00:59:12.203 --> 00:59:27.991]  We have been reporting on ISIS or radical Islam's use of these social network platforms to recruit and spread its propaganda, mostly in the light of the hypocritical sense that you can be centered on Facebook or Twitter for being a conservative, sharing InfoWars links, speaking bad about Obama, or being a Trump supporter.
[00:59:28.111 --> 00:59:29.652]  But somehow, magically,
[00:59:29.912 --> 00:59:34.015]  Radical Islamic terror groups have managed to continue their usage of these platforms.
[00:59:34.335 --> 00:59:43.521]  But perhaps now, for these double-standard hypocritical companies, the chickens are coming home to roost, as the lawsuit is now making its way to a federal court in eastern Michigan.
[00:59:43.701 --> 00:59:45.943]  This isn't the first time these companies have been sued.
[00:59:46.163 --> 00:59:57.130]  In June, the family of a victim of the Paris attacks sued Facebook, Twitter, and Google for the same reason, allowing a terrorist group to radicalize people on their platform who eventually carry out deadly attacks.
[00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:59.372]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[01:00:01.837 --> 01:00:07.753]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:11.604 --> 01:00:18.207]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:48.384 --> 01:00:57.953]  Under leftist brainwashing, this German Berliner Barana music would be called Nazi, or it would be called
[01:01:01.067 --> 01:01:03.750]  It would be called cultural expropriation.
[01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:05.551]  Everything's a thought crime.
[01:01:05.632 --> 01:01:19.726]  Every word, every new vocabulary they give you will then be made obsolete within the month or within the year so that they can sit in the place of arbitrating what words can be used, what culture can be adopted.
[01:01:20.998 --> 01:01:23.920]  That's why it starts with something simple like, don't call us homosexual.
[01:01:24.341 --> 01:01:27.663]  That scientific term, like heterosexual, hurts us.
[01:01:27.763 --> 01:01:28.504]  Call it straight.
[01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:29.285]  Call it gay.
[01:01:29.945 --> 01:01:31.386]  You go, okay, I want to be nice.
[01:01:31.466 --> 01:01:32.067]  You're gay.
[01:01:32.367 --> 01:01:32.908]  You're happy.
[01:01:32.928 --> 01:01:39.493]  You can expropriate words now and, you know, basically without even going to court, just, just, just, you know, change scientific terms.
[01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:44.366]  And then now, don't say you have a mother and father.
[01:01:44.426 --> 01:01:45.467]  Some people don't have that.
[01:01:46.107 --> 01:01:47.488]  Don't say brown paper bag.
[01:01:47.528 --> 01:01:48.528]  That hurts people's feelings.
[01:01:48.548 --> 01:01:49.108]  That's racist.
[01:01:49.548 --> 01:01:53.210]  No one ever said it was racist, but we say it is, so you can't use that term now.
[01:01:55.231 --> 01:01:57.272]  And by the way, don't say this is an Islamic attack.
[01:01:57.292 --> 01:01:58.772]  That only encourages more of the attacks.
[01:01:59.373 --> 01:02:01.934]  We're gonna arrest you if you say this was Islam.
[01:02:03.134 --> 01:02:04.595]  We've hired former Stasi to do it.
[01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:08.752]  I mean, it's like they think the public has collective amnesia.
[01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:16.779]  It's our job to expose the fact that this is a cult, multi-cult.
[01:02:17.439 --> 01:02:25.146]  Culturalism is about bringing in all these other people who are just people that act just like people, act like white people, act like black people.
[01:02:25.526 --> 01:02:26.387]  Humans act the same.
[01:02:26.647 --> 01:02:29.549]  Then they program the minorities to be race-based.
[01:02:31.971 --> 01:02:32.532]  It's incredible.
[01:02:34.025 --> 01:02:36.007]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:02:36.567 --> 01:02:41.311]  Now we're going to, after the break, get some guests on the broadcast.
[01:02:41.331 --> 01:02:42.692]  We have quite a few today.
[01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:48.697]  Gerald Salente is coming up at the bottom of the hour to give us his breakdown of what we've seen in the year past and what's coming up in the future.
[01:02:50.078 --> 01:02:51.639]  We've got Roger Stone popping in.
[01:02:51.659 --> 01:02:58.365]  He's decided to rally and come on for about 10 minutes even though he's got a cold or is under the weather from not sleeping as much as he should, writing this book.
[01:02:58.385 --> 01:03:01.207]  He's been working 18 to 20 hours a day the last few weeks.
[01:03:01.928 --> 01:03:02.968]  And then we've got
[01:03:04.926 --> 01:03:12.552]  Paul Joseph Watson scheduled to be hosting the fourth hour today from London, England.
[01:03:12.592 --> 01:03:15.474]  He's got some guests joining him as well.
[01:03:15.494 --> 01:03:20.157]  So you don't want to miss all of the rest of the three hours that are laid out before us.
[01:03:21.618 --> 01:03:27.203]  Now, I need to take a breath here and just sit back and think about what we've just witnessed.
[01:03:27.563 --> 01:03:31.386]  I have really not spent any time so far
[01:03:32.759 --> 01:03:46.504]  Talking about the fact that we have seen Donald J. Trump come from way behind to get the nomination despite the fact that he tried to steal that outrageously.
[01:03:47.512 --> 01:04:14.751]  to becoming president-elect and then now the last five weeks of total hysteria trying to stop that and trying to have recounts that only got him more votes and trying to then launch wars and other diversions and trying to say there's a terror attack it's his fault and then saying that again the electors shouldn't go for him despite all that he got what 303 electors
[01:04:18.328 --> 01:04:23.410]  Of the 270 needed, and they had a bunch of electors actually go against Hillary.
[01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:29.353]  More electors went against Hillary, even though no one promoted that, than went against Trump.
[01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:38.116]  So it actually backfired in another incredibly repudiating reversal, and just showing people don't want her.
[01:04:39.917 --> 01:04:44.359]  And I'm glad it was Bernie Sanders people that realized they stole the nomination from him and said, you know what?
[01:04:46.164 --> 01:04:50.709]  We're going to be faithless for you because you were faithless and stole this.
[01:04:51.169 --> 01:04:54.332]  She lost four in Washington State alone.
[01:04:56.915 --> 01:05:00.038]  So that's all coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[01:05:00.058 --> 01:05:09.188]  We've got video and audio of them getting hysterical and crying and screaming when their goddess, the arrogant stumbling tyrant, failed.
[01:05:14.042 --> 01:05:25.567]  Now we have a rock icon, a guy that I've listened to since he was with the McCoys in the epic hit, Hang On Sloopy, knocked off the charts only by the Beatles.
[01:05:26.167 --> 01:05:42.174]  I know you are a vocal Trump supporter, and people wouldn't expect that because I guess they think that you can't be a conservative or a libertarian or a liberty-oriented individual and know how to rock out, which is entirely wrong.
[01:05:42.694 --> 01:05:44.495]  What brought you to Donald Trump?
[01:05:44.535 --> 01:05:45.995]  There he is.
[01:05:46.815 --> 01:05:50.917]  Well, you know, it might have been partly because we don't watch TV.
[01:05:51.517 --> 01:05:56.558]  My wife and I don't really have even our terrestrial TV stuff hooked up.
[01:05:57.019 --> 01:06:02.500]  So I never saw Donald Trump going, you're fired and all that stuff.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:09.383]  I think some people took him lightly because they only remembered seeing like TV shows and things.
[01:06:09.703 --> 01:06:10.363]  I never saw them.
[01:06:11.107 --> 01:06:14.910]  I always tell people I'm not a Republican or necessarily a Democrat.
[01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:16.051]  I'm a pragmatist.
[01:06:16.591 --> 01:06:18.413]  I want to see things get done.
[01:06:19.113 --> 01:06:27.820]  And he promised, when you go down the list, very early in his candidacy, he promised all the things that I want to have done.
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:31.282]  You were rewriting a special song for Donald Trump.
[01:06:31.322 --> 01:06:37.647]  Your real American anthem, I understand, is going to have kind of a touch-up.
[01:06:38.618 --> 01:06:46.865]  Well, Real American was written in the 80s, and I just wanted to write the most patriotic song of all time.
[01:06:46.965 --> 01:06:47.725]  It's very simple.
[01:06:49.066 --> 01:06:58.194]  Paul Kogan heard it in the midst of a project I was working on with the World Wrestling Federation, and he decided that he wanted it to be his theme song.
[01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:03.858]  And then all of a sudden, Hillary Clinton was running in a primary against Barack Obama,
[01:07:04.779 --> 01:07:10.842]  And I saw her come up on stage somewhere and she had, I'm a real American, played.
[01:07:11.662 --> 01:07:22.707]  Well, whether or not you like Hillary Clinton, I, as a songwriter, said, man, that's where I expected to see that song all along, with legitimate status associated with it.
[01:07:23.067 --> 01:07:25.928]  Then Newt Gingrich won his primary.
[01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:27.008]  He used it.
[01:07:27.909 --> 01:07:28.229]  And then
[01:07:29.432 --> 01:07:36.617]  People were complaining about Barack Obama not having a birth certificate, so they made him a birth certificate.
[01:07:37.118 --> 01:07:47.305]  They created a video with my song Real American again, and every time the guitar riff played, his birth certificate would bounce in and out of the screen along with the guitar riff.
[01:07:47.945 --> 01:07:49.226]  And I thought that was pretty cool.
[01:07:49.307 --> 01:07:52.229]  Once again, can't get much better than the President using your stuff.
[01:07:52.309 --> 01:08:03.099]  Trust me, Rick, if you're there with this song, in Donald Trump's spirit, and Alex Jones, who's anchoring to come, your song will be heard loud and clear.
[01:08:03.139 --> 01:08:06.162]  And we'll have the people, that I assure you of.
[01:08:21.582 --> 01:08:23.764]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:08:24.184 --> 01:08:26.706]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:08:27.247 --> 01:08:29.569]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:08:38.573 --> 01:08:46.239]  Now, everybody knows that I'm obsessed with how the global social engineers are able to set the parameters and label things.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.522]  They call themselves progressives, they call themselves liberals.
[01:08:50.403 --> 01:09:06.736]  Then, when they're in opposition to what libertarians and patriots want, they say, oh, you're right-wing extremists, and then they couple everybody else onto the horrible agenda being carried out by the fake establishment, blue blood, robber baron republicans.
[01:09:07.995 --> 01:09:21.883]  But then, in real policy, the Democrats and Republicans carry out the globalism, carry out the modern imperialism, carry out the modern oppression, and then respectively point fingers at each other and say, everybody does it.
[01:09:22.863 --> 01:09:37.632]  Well, Carol Quigley wrote Tragedy and Hope in the 60s for the CIA because their own section chiefs couldn't understand why they were funding communists, socialists, and fascists, as well as just run-of-the-mill dictators, instead of promoting liberty.
[01:09:38.851 --> 01:09:48.775]  They were changing over from the Eisenhower policy of trying to put good governments in, which is bad enough because you see where it goes, to putting bad governments in.
[01:09:49.195 --> 01:10:01.600]  And quickly, in the book, which we sell by the way in hardcover, it's back in print, 1100 pages, wasn't meant for the general public, there were lawsuits over it, but because the government paid for it, it went into open domain.
[01:10:02.827 --> 01:10:09.393]  When first only a few copies were out there that got leaked, they tried to deny it was real in the early 70s, folks.
[01:10:09.634 --> 01:10:13.718]  There was a whole controversy over this book.
[01:10:13.738 --> 01:10:23.287]  1,100 pages, you read it, it's a blueprint, a owner's manual, an operator's manual on how to run full-spectrum political dominance.
[01:10:24.388 --> 01:10:26.370]  But at the end, it's all command and control.
[01:10:27.898 --> 01:10:31.839]  And it's anti-free market and wants monopolies, oligopolies.
[01:10:32.179 --> 01:10:34.560]  Brzezinski's written books that are public admitting it all as well.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:36.880]  But those are public.
[01:10:38.941 --> 01:10:42.561]  And so that's why they're bringing in Islam, because it's not compatible.
[01:10:43.762 --> 01:10:54.844]  And so the leftists who hate the states, and who hate the electoral college, and who, you know, all this other garbage, suddenly love it and love the states, and said be faithless electors.
[01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:56.945]  Well, Hillary Clinton lost.
[01:10:57.896 --> 01:11:00.957]  More electors than Trump did.
[01:11:00.997 --> 01:11:02.938]  In fact, I did the math yesterday.
[01:11:04.559 --> 01:11:11.402]  The issue was, even in states where people are allowed to be faithless, they just ignored them, arrested them, drugged them out, you name it.
[01:11:11.442 --> 01:11:13.122]  Imagine if Trump people did that.
[01:11:13.642 --> 01:11:19.165]  Turns out, I counted these up last night, Hillary lost more than 30 electors.
[01:11:20.065 --> 01:11:22.006]  Trump just lost a few.
[01:11:23.362 --> 01:11:23.782]  Incredible.
[01:11:24.743 --> 01:11:28.446]  So, Hillary lost four in Washington.
[01:11:28.466 --> 01:11:31.148]  The reason that's so important, that's where the four stuck.
[01:11:32.509 --> 01:11:33.510]  They went to Bernie Sanders.
[01:11:34.271 --> 01:11:37.934]  In other places, they just ignored it, and it was not even in the news, or it was mentioned.
[01:11:37.954 --> 01:11:45.420]  Well, this group of seven, or this group of four, or this group of ten, or this group of two, tried to vote against, but weren't allowed.
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:46.521]  The police took them out.
[01:11:49.278 --> 01:11:53.902]  So I sat there before I shot a live video on Facebook last night and I tally them up.
[01:11:54.562 --> 01:11:56.804]  And there's also mainstream news articles that also admitted it.
[01:11:56.824 --> 01:12:01.107]  They're like, yeah, Hillary was rebuffed or Hillary lost more than Trump.
[01:12:02.508 --> 01:12:06.852]  So imagine, they're advertising, they're writing thousands of letters to each elector who's Republican.
[01:12:06.872 --> 01:12:10.034]  They have Hollywood stars saying, do this, do this, do this, do this.
[01:12:11.696 --> 01:12:14.438]  And they get rebuked because Hillary
[01:12:16.348 --> 01:12:19.569]  Joe Biden had to go out on the trail and say, I know you don't like Hillary.
[01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:21.630]  I know you like Sanders.
[01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:23.851]  But man, Donald Trump's evil.
[01:12:24.731 --> 01:12:35.856]  And record numbers of Reagan Democrats, black and white and Hispanic, those type of folks went and they voted for Trump, the same people that voted for Obama, hoping for change.
[01:12:36.136 --> 01:12:40.398]  And if Trump doesn't deliver or die trying, he'll be more hated than Obama.
[01:12:40.418 --> 01:12:43.179]  Because people weren't sure but gave Obama a chance.
[01:12:44.051 --> 01:12:47.654]  I didn't like McCain myself, so I was like, I'm pretty much neutral.
[01:12:48.215 --> 01:12:51.118]  Except McCain claims he's less anti-gun, so I gotta go McCain.
[01:12:51.298 --> 01:12:52.199]  But I didn't vote for him.
[01:12:52.479 --> 01:12:54.641]  I just said, we're gonna see what happens.
[01:12:54.701 --> 01:12:56.523]  And boy, Obama was worse than I thought.
[01:12:56.983 --> 01:13:01.768]  I hated the Republicans so much, that one of the few times I was wrong in my life,
[01:13:02.853 --> 01:13:03.793]  I didn't support McCain.
[01:13:04.114 --> 01:13:05.574]  And, of course, he was meant to lose.
[01:13:05.654 --> 01:13:08.275]  So, it was like a Don King boxing match, they say, you know.
[01:13:08.595 --> 01:13:12.597]  Reportedly, allegedly, sometimes, you know, both boxers kind of know what's going on.
[01:13:12.777 --> 01:13:13.137]  Who knows?
[01:13:13.438 --> 01:13:15.518]  The point is, in that case, we knew the fix was in.
[01:13:16.419 --> 01:13:17.299]  So, I said, hey, the fix is in.
[01:13:17.319 --> 01:13:17.819]  It doesn't matter.
[01:13:17.839 --> 01:13:18.480]  He's the new Messiah.
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.120]  We'll see what happens.
[01:13:20.501 --> 01:13:22.181]  But, boy, the racial division, all of it.
[01:13:22.221 --> 01:13:29.264]  So, you've got these whining babies in Wisconsin, wailing and freaking out.
[01:13:30.145 --> 01:13:30.505]  Here it is.
[01:13:32.106 --> 01:13:35.008]  Thank you tellers for telling the votes.
[01:13:35.688 --> 01:13:38.690]  The votes are 10 votes Donald J Trump.
[01:14:00.501 --> 01:14:08.384]  This is not America.
[01:14:08.504 --> 01:14:10.584]  America's been stolen.
[01:14:10.624 --> 01:14:13.505]  Don't do this.
[01:14:13.545 --> 01:14:15.006]  This is begging for Hillary.
[01:14:15.366 --> 01:14:23.548]  This is begging for Hillary, who launches all these wars, steals the donation money from the Haitians.
[01:14:24.188 --> 01:14:25.789]  He's involved in all this corruption.
[01:14:28.498 --> 01:14:30.339]  And they're saying, shame, shame, shame.
[01:14:30.719 --> 01:14:31.380]  Shame on you!
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:38.264]  And then they go on and choose the electors also for Mr. Pence.
[01:14:39.104 --> 01:14:40.165]  Now, Vice President Pence.
[01:14:41.446 --> 01:14:43.147]  Elect, but about to be president in 30 days.
[01:14:43.567 --> 01:14:45.448]  You think these desperate people are going to stop?
[01:14:45.968 --> 01:14:50.531]  Now notice, they blamed the racists and they blamed the homophobes.
[01:14:52.052 --> 01:14:54.874]  Now your Russian agents, if you support Trump.
[01:14:56.823 --> 01:15:03.446]  You want World War III, even though most analysts and historians on the left and right say, no, no, Hillary would push us towards World War III?
[01:15:05.287 --> 01:15:06.187]  Trump's a businessman.
[01:15:06.227 --> 01:15:07.127]  He wants a win-win.
[01:15:07.347 --> 01:15:08.648]  He doesn't want austerity.
[01:15:08.828 --> 01:15:09.808]  He doesn't want eugenics.
[01:15:10.008 --> 01:15:11.129]  He doesn't want World War III.
[01:15:11.589 --> 01:15:13.370]  That's what the whole Davos system is.
[01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:14.891]  They're ultra-rich, you're poor.
[01:15:15.131 --> 01:15:16.131]  They end competition.
[01:15:16.311 --> 01:15:17.432]  They sew up the whole world.
[01:15:17.692 --> 01:15:20.693]  They're diplomatically immune, above the law, tax-exempt.
[01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:28.817]  Globalism is the new royalty and you only operate through license, through licensure to them and administrative law.
[01:15:28.917 --> 01:15:30.519]  That's what the world government is!
[01:15:30.879 --> 01:15:31.921]  Read the white papers!
[01:15:33.402 --> 01:15:35.585]  And because I have read their white papers, I've been contacted.
[01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:38.848]  And I've been offered jobs with them.
[01:15:39.369 --> 01:15:40.330]  How's 3 million sound?
[01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:41.231]  How's 10 million sound?
[01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:47.773]  And I even had Rothkopf, head of the Kissinger group at the time, come on the show.
[01:15:48.094 --> 01:15:49.194]  He knew who I was.
[01:15:49.915 --> 01:15:51.076]  And John Herman hurt during the breaks.
[01:15:51.116 --> 01:15:53.177]  He also said on air, Alex, come to New York.
[01:15:53.237 --> 01:15:53.697]  Meet with us.
[01:15:53.717 --> 01:15:55.499]  You know, you're the leader of your group.
[01:15:55.519 --> 01:15:57.020]  You're going to be the leader of the opposition.
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:57.640]  Just work with us.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:58.381]  It's a good plan.
[01:15:58.761 --> 01:15:59.622]  World government's good.
[01:15:59.702 --> 01:16:00.282]  Alex, come on.
[01:16:00.843 --> 01:16:02.023]  He said, I just had to get out of here.
[01:16:02.043 --> 01:16:04.225]  You know, you're not, you're just not sensible.
[01:16:05.446 --> 01:16:07.327]  They just have this confidence of we're the good guys.
[01:16:07.567 --> 01:16:08.168]  We run things.
[01:16:08.188 --> 01:16:08.848]  We're taking over.
[01:16:09.509 --> 01:16:10.229]  He said it on air.
[01:16:10.429 --> 01:16:11.090]  He said it off air.
[01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:12.331]  Yeah, there's a world government.
[01:16:13.391 --> 01:16:13.972]  Join it, Alex.
[01:16:16.281 --> 01:16:18.322]  And I've had people bigger than Rothkopf.
[01:16:19.182 --> 01:16:21.302]  And I wear a journalistic hat, so I'm in a meeting with somebody.
[01:16:23.043 --> 01:16:25.344]  You know, it's off record unless they talk about criminal stuff.
[01:16:25.924 --> 01:16:28.405]  And they just say, Alex, the public's a bunch of dumb scum.
[01:16:28.425 --> 01:16:29.165]  They don't want your help.
[01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:31.805]  They're gonna adapt to be slaves, not the other way around.
[01:16:32.246 --> 01:16:33.266]  They're gonna tear you apart.
[01:16:35.049 --> 01:16:35.830]  You just need to join us.
[01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:37.791]  And I say, why are you saying I should join you?
[01:16:38.252 --> 01:16:38.872]  Well, you get it.
[01:16:38.972 --> 01:16:39.833]  You read our documents.
[01:16:39.853 --> 01:16:40.253]  You care.
[01:16:40.634 --> 01:16:41.594]  You understand the plan.
[01:16:41.995 --> 01:16:42.675]  You should join us.
[01:16:43.316 --> 01:16:44.196]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:16:44.517 --> 01:16:47.379]  You can see it there forethought that they were trying to hire me.
[01:16:47.399 --> 01:16:50.622]  I'm sure they hire a lot of folks that they see as up and comers.
[01:16:50.642 --> 01:16:52.043]  19 years ago.
[01:16:54.144 --> 01:16:54.965]  The offer started.
[01:16:55.966 --> 01:17:00.390]  Small networks, big networks, the biggest networks, then other deals, TV deals, movie deals.
[01:17:00.911 --> 01:17:06.917]  And they look at me and they go, you don't want $10 million, book deals, the best looking women, and movie deals.
[01:17:07.457 --> 01:17:08.678]  Guaranteed movie deals.
[01:17:09.159 --> 01:17:10.180]  You're gonna be a movie star.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.042]  You got the talent, you got it all.
[01:17:12.562 --> 01:17:13.163]  No, I don't want it.
[01:17:14.724 --> 01:17:14.905]  Alex.
[01:17:16.411 --> 01:17:18.152]  Ten million dollars is more than I make.
[01:17:18.172 --> 01:17:18.993]  Now, I got a bunch of stock.
[01:17:19.013 --> 01:17:20.734]  This is the kind of conversations with presidents of things.
[01:17:21.314 --> 01:17:22.955]  You don't want ten million dollars.
[01:17:23.335 --> 01:17:24.696]  No, I don't want ten million dollars.
[01:17:26.037 --> 01:17:29.018]  But see, the general public hasn't experienced these things.
[01:17:29.459 --> 01:17:32.640]  They don't know, but they're now learning via the WikiLeaks.
[01:17:33.321 --> 01:17:34.041]  Now, let me continue.
[01:17:36.142 --> 01:17:37.063]  Let's go to this next one.
[01:17:37.143 --> 01:17:40.445]  Liberal losers, who again aren't liberals, cry and complain.
[01:17:40.465 --> 01:17:41.185]  We just played that.
[01:17:41.265 --> 01:17:45.148]  Clinton supporters, racism, Russia, why we lost, CNN.
[01:17:46.414 --> 01:17:57.556]  So it's this compilation of Russia, racists, homophobes, everything but them, everything but Hillary being a crook, everything but we're sick of the Clinton name, everything but we want change.
[01:17:59.017 --> 01:18:02.997]  That's why the same white Midwest elected Obama who you now call racist.
[01:18:03.077 --> 01:18:04.438]  It's made up crap.
[01:18:06.398 --> 01:18:06.978]  And then we come back.
[01:18:06.998 --> 01:18:09.579]  I'm gonna tell you about the real discussions going on in white America.
[01:18:10.319 --> 01:18:12.899]  I'm gonna let you in on the real secret of what's going on in white America.
[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:14.520]  You gonna hear it?
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:15.640]  On the other side.
[01:18:16.721 --> 01:18:18.742]  But first, let's go out to the break with this clip.
[01:18:19.522 --> 01:18:37.889]  As the weeks went by, that deep sense of sadness and loss gave way to a tremendous, tremendous anger as we realized from all the news that's coming out that this election was stolen from the American people by Russia.
[01:18:38.309 --> 01:18:41.090]  What evidence do you have that Russia stole the election?
[01:18:41.170 --> 01:18:42.671]  There was information from the CIA.
[01:18:43.991 --> 01:18:47.332]  Saying that Russia was meddling in the election?
[01:18:47.372 --> 01:18:50.233]  But what evidence do you have that it swayed the outcome?
[01:18:50.873 --> 01:18:59.476]  The hacking that the Russian government did of the DNC emails provided... They use the term hack to mean political hack, influence in the media.
[01:19:00.357 --> 01:19:01.957]  Okay, this has all been disproven.
[01:19:02.317 --> 01:19:04.638]  The head of all intelligence has come out and said it's all bull.
[01:19:04.958 --> 01:19:08.439]  But the Chinese and the Saudi Arabians were openly involved bragging about it.
[01:19:08.739 --> 01:19:10.260]  And look how helpless these women look.
[01:19:11.192 --> 01:19:12.833]  You think folks like this built this country?
[01:19:13.013 --> 01:19:16.456]  They've created these soft bureaucrat types that are in la-la land.
[01:19:16.496 --> 01:19:16.936]  Here they are.
[01:19:16.956 --> 01:19:28.125]  The thing that the Russian government did of the DNC emails provided an endless supply of negative commentary in the news about Hillary.
[01:19:28.445 --> 01:19:34.410]  How many people think that Russia swayed the outcome of this race?
[01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:37.072]  Had it not been for Russia, Hillary Clinton would have won.
[01:19:38.646 --> 01:19:39.406]  You know what, hit pause.
[01:19:39.446 --> 01:19:41.267]  We're going to come back and play the rest.
[01:19:41.667 --> 01:19:42.927]  Folks, this is so asinine.
[01:19:43.707 --> 01:19:48.589]  The entire mainstream media admitted they had no qualms about lying about Trump.
[01:19:49.109 --> 01:19:50.009]  Totally negative.
[01:19:50.109 --> 01:19:50.830]  Deception.
[01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:52.630]  Coordinating with the White House.
[01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:54.551]  Coordinating with everybody.
[01:19:56.331 --> 01:19:58.532]  And then they changed the subject off the WikiLeaks.
[01:19:59.454 --> 01:20:01.536]  He's claiming Russia did it with no evidence.
[01:20:01.636 --> 01:20:04.118]  I mean, it is just ridiculous.
[01:20:04.959 --> 01:20:06.180]  You didn't vote against Hillary.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.542]  No, the Russians mind-controlled you.
[01:20:12.806 --> 01:20:24.216]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for President of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
[01:20:26.658 --> 01:20:30.099]  They see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump.
[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:33.041]  The career politicians hate Trump.
[01:20:33.461 --> 01:20:38.023]  It's just awfully good that Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[01:20:39.863 --> 01:20:40.784]  Because you'd be in jail.
[01:20:41.875 --> 01:20:47.558]  Trump's election is going to be the biggest f*** you ever recorded in human history.
[01:20:48.118 --> 01:20:50.460]  You think your business background helps you with campaigning?
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.021]  I was doing the primaries.
[01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:55.562]  I spent less money than other people and I did better.
[01:20:56.183 --> 01:20:57.563]  And that's what we want to do for the country.
[01:20:57.583 --> 01:20:59.585]  We want to spend less money and do better.
[01:21:00.745 --> 01:21:07.769]  I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.
[01:21:07.789 --> 01:21:09.410]  Hi, this is Ted Cruz calling.
[01:21:20.253 --> 01:21:25.477]  Death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.
[01:21:26.037 --> 01:21:28.900]  This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton.
[01:21:46.663 --> 01:21:48.045]  I think the media is very dishonest.
[01:21:48.105 --> 01:21:48.947]  I say it all the time.
[01:21:49.127 --> 01:21:52.491]  I think they're among the most dishonest human beings I've ever met.
[01:22:07.876 --> 01:22:22.388]  Remember, Hillary Clinton has some vulnerabilities herself because of her support in the 1990s for anti-crime legislation that ultimately helped contribute to this era of mass incarceration that she now speaks out again.
[01:22:24.370 --> 01:22:26.251]  We just lost Brianna Keillor.
[01:22:26.271 --> 01:22:29.754]  I'm not a super predator, Hillary Clinton.
[01:22:29.794 --> 01:22:30.635]  We'll talk about it.
[01:22:30.655 --> 01:22:32.677]  We apologize to black people for mass incarceration.
[01:22:35.049 --> 01:22:36.130]  I will be the nominee.
[01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:38.212]  There is no way that I won't be.
[01:22:39.132 --> 01:22:47.860]  Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections?
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:49.621]  Is that democracy?
[01:22:49.641 --> 01:23:00.410]  All of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out of the call by a rigged system, we welcome you with open arms.
[01:23:06.337 --> 01:23:08.139]  History is watching us now.
[01:23:08.899 --> 01:23:12.262]  It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion.
[01:23:12.602 --> 01:23:13.463]  Just win, baby.
[01:23:13.763 --> 01:23:20.669]  And if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.
[01:23:21.770 --> 01:23:22.570]  I am with you.
[01:23:23.871 --> 01:23:24.912]  I will fight for you.
[01:23:25.753 --> 01:23:27.514]  And I will win for you.
[01:23:30.437 --> 01:23:31.718]  I am your voice.
[01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:43.871]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[01:23:44.091 --> 01:23:47.154]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[01:23:47.434 --> 01:23:48.235]  Because it's already here.
[01:23:48.615 --> 01:23:49.276]  It's being announced.
[01:23:49.636 --> 01:23:53.099]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[01:23:53.519 --> 01:23:55.421]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:23:55.561 --> 01:23:57.122]  A new battleship in the fight.
[01:23:57.302 --> 01:23:58.323]  InfoWars Live.
[01:23:58.503 --> 01:23:59.324]  Available right now.
[01:23:59.604 --> 01:24:00.945]  We're looking for a crew to manor.
[01:24:01.386 --> 01:24:03.788]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[01:24:04.488 --> 01:24:05.409]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[01:24:05.969 --> 01:24:08.972]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[01:24:09.472 --> 01:24:10.033]  Take action!
[01:24:14.578 --> 01:24:22.103]  30 days from now, on Friday, January 20th, 2016, the 45th President of the United States will be sworn in and inaugurated.
[01:24:23.764 --> 01:24:29.208]  And if you don't think they're going to cause riots and all sorts of attacks, I think you're living on another planet.
[01:24:29.528 --> 01:24:31.229]  I should open the phones up and ask callers.
[01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:33.691]  I always love to crowdsource your views.
[01:24:33.711 --> 01:24:34.471]  It's always amazing.
[01:24:34.892 --> 01:24:37.073]  On how do you think they're going to try to disrupt it now?
[01:24:37.153 --> 01:24:37.874]  They failed.
[01:24:39.423 --> 01:24:40.443]  It's still in the nomination.
[01:24:40.484 --> 01:24:42.224]  They failed trying to steal the general election.
[01:24:42.624 --> 01:24:44.005]  They failed with their fake recounts.
[01:24:44.025 --> 01:24:45.005]  They gave more votes to Trump.
[01:24:45.025 --> 01:24:48.907]  They failed with the unseating of the electors.
[01:24:50.388 --> 01:24:56.871]  Some say there could still be some manipulation up until the 6th or so when they're announced.
[01:24:57.231 --> 01:24:58.852]  But there could be something happening in Congress.
[01:24:58.872 --> 01:25:00.252]  But I don't really see that happening now.
[01:25:01.433 --> 01:25:02.693]  I told you they were going to try, though.
[01:25:03.053 --> 01:25:05.895]  But now I feel better about the process.
[01:25:07.074 --> 01:25:09.775]  We've gotten out of the woods, but I feel like something's over the hill.
[01:25:11.296 --> 01:25:11.796]  What do you think?
[01:25:11.816 --> 01:25:17.538]  In fact, I'm going to open the phones up to take calls on this subject when Salente joins us, just to pop in with your quick comment.
[01:25:17.558 --> 01:25:17.919]  800-2599-231.
[01:25:17.939 --> 01:25:18.079]  800-2599-231.
[01:25:18.199 --> 01:25:22.921]  Now, I got cut off getting into the butt hurtness of the liberals in a focus group on CNN.
[01:25:31.562 --> 01:25:37.607]  All these focus groups have turned out to be fake with Democratic operatives, but it's all these women that are just shocked the Russians took over.
[01:25:38.088 --> 01:25:42.672]  It's all been discredited, it's all bull, but it changes the subject from the WikiLeaks!
[01:25:45.225 --> 01:25:47.006]  It's so ridiculous!
[01:25:47.826 --> 01:25:49.607]  Talk about a conspiracy theory!
[01:25:50.128 --> 01:25:50.908]  It was U.S.
[01:25:50.988 --> 01:25:52.609]  intelligence linked the information.
[01:25:53.009 --> 01:25:53.610]  It was U.S.
[01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:57.492]  intelligence linked up with the Russians and gave intel on helping kill ISIS.
[01:25:58.372 --> 01:26:02.555]  Our military told Obama three plus years ago, it stops now.
[01:26:02.895 --> 01:26:04.436]  And I told you that was historical.
[01:26:04.936 --> 01:26:07.037]  There's already been a soft coup against the globalists.
[01:26:07.297 --> 01:26:09.058]  The globalists took over the country through fraud.
[01:26:09.418 --> 01:26:10.479]  There was a soft coup.
[01:26:13.581 --> 01:26:17.625]  Because the internet news, not just us, was able to get the information to the troops.
[01:26:19.067 --> 01:26:24.052]  Pat Riley was on a plane yesterday, back from taking some time off with his wife in Sedona, Arizona.
[01:26:25.273 --> 01:26:33.522]  And as they landed, the news was coming out that there had been this latest truck attack in Berlin, killing a bunch of people.
[01:26:33.562 --> 01:26:34.062]  It's now 12 people.
[01:26:35.495 --> 01:26:36.475]  More in critical condition.
[01:26:36.495 --> 01:26:37.316]  60 plus injured.
[01:26:38.216 --> 01:26:40.837]  And he said he started watching people sitting beside him in front of him.
[01:26:40.857 --> 01:26:42.477]  Clearly a military guy went to Info Wars.
[01:26:42.637 --> 01:26:43.558]  It wasn't updated yet.
[01:26:44.278 --> 01:26:44.758]  30 minutes after.
[01:26:44.778 --> 01:26:46.739]  And then he watched the guy go to Drudge.
[01:26:48.479 --> 01:26:49.680]  And then he's walking down the hall.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.121]  He watches somebody go to Fox.
[01:26:52.361 --> 01:26:52.901]  It's not there.
[01:26:52.921 --> 01:26:54.942]  He watches them go to Info Wars.
[01:26:54.982 --> 01:26:57.302]  And then he watches them go to Drudge.
[01:26:57.863 --> 01:26:59.443]  I mean, there it is right there.
[01:26:59.503 --> 01:27:00.724]  Of course, Drudge had it within two minutes.
[01:27:03.444 --> 01:27:04.925]  I was sitting there shooting a video at home.
[01:27:09.250 --> 01:27:17.236]  And already on the niece situation and part two what happened in Berlin and then the news came in that he got in the 270.
[01:27:17.276 --> 01:27:27.563]  Sure enough I went to Drudge and Drudge had it and I called up the great crew that's why we need a few more staff and said hey post this article.
[01:27:28.373 --> 01:27:33.097]  It's kind of that in-between time at like five o'clock or so is when people are going off to shift.
[01:27:33.117 --> 01:27:37.241]  There's not really anybody at night who's on unless this crew just decides to work 18 hours a day.
[01:27:37.261 --> 01:27:40.044]  I need four or five more writers, more posters, more analysts.
[01:27:40.384 --> 01:27:41.305]  I need more camera people.
[01:27:41.585 --> 01:27:42.006]  I need it now.
[01:27:42.898 --> 01:27:46.680]  That's why we have free shipping short wide to try to get enough volume to pay the bills around here.
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.261]  People respond to discounts.
[01:27:48.781 --> 01:27:53.904]  The products are already discounted generally, but we lower the prices, like 33% off on Rainforce.
[01:27:53.924 --> 01:27:54.804]  20% more now on each bottle.
[01:27:54.844 --> 01:27:55.885]  That's basically a lost liter.
[01:27:57.145 --> 01:27:58.106]  50% off on Colloidal Silver.
[01:27:58.626 --> 01:27:59.967]  $9.95 right now and free shipping.
[01:28:00.227 --> 01:28:02.008]  Sign up for auto ship, an additional 10% off.
[01:28:02.288 --> 01:28:03.669]  We're extending it throughout the week!
[01:28:04.616 --> 01:28:05.116]  We're good to go.
[01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:25.952]  Again, the sites weren't hacked in the traditional sense of gotten into.
[01:28:26.373 --> 01:28:30.716]  They were just blocked with massive denial-of-service attacks, DDoS attacks, robot attacks.
[01:28:31.496 --> 01:28:32.857]  And so now they're back up for now.
[01:28:32.937 --> 01:28:33.878]  Thank you for your support.
[01:28:33.918 --> 01:28:43.604]  If you're unable to order, or there's more products you want to get, or you want to support the First Amendment, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or always you can call toll-free 24-7, 888-253-3139.
[01:28:43.624 --> 01:28:46.606]  Let's go out to break though with the rest of the CNN disinformation.
[01:28:55.593 --> 01:29:08.282]  The hacking that the Russian government did of the DNC emails provided an endless supply of negative commentary in the news about Hillary.
[01:29:08.602 --> 01:29:17.189]  How many people think that Russia swayed the outcome of this race had it not been for Russia Hillary Clinton would have won?
[01:29:19.065 --> 01:29:19.686]  You agree with that?
[01:29:19.906 --> 01:29:20.466]  I don't know.
[01:29:20.487 --> 01:29:23.029]  Well, we don't know yet.
[01:29:23.129 --> 01:29:31.558]  But for months and months and months, all of the American voters were swayed by what they heard and saw on the news.
[01:29:31.738 --> 01:29:35.582]  The other thing I thought was a big factor is the fake news on Facebook.
[01:29:36.577 --> 01:29:36.797]  Why?
[01:29:36.877 --> 01:29:38.819]  What fake news story cost her the election?
[01:29:38.879 --> 01:29:46.384]  I would say that the fake news and the Russia stuff are very connected because a lot of the fake news came out of people's interpretation of the leaks.
[01:29:46.604 --> 01:29:55.290]  A lot of the late deciding voters broke for Trump and the Comey email, it sort of seemed to line up in terms of timing with the Comey email.
[01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:59.533]  What I don't hear you saying is putting any responsibility on her campaign.
[01:30:20.407 --> 01:30:28.333]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:28.393 --> 01:30:31.476]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[01:30:32.301 --> 01:30:34.142]  And they're also very affordable.
[01:30:56.269 --> 01:31:03.020]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[01:31:03.421 --> 01:31:04.182]  It's a win-win.
[01:31:04.663 --> 01:31:05.444]  InfoWarsLife.com
[01:31:10.697 --> 01:31:15.598]  Facebook, Twitter, and Google have now been sued by families of the victims of the Orlando nightclub shootings.
[01:31:15.838 --> 01:31:21.920]  The families of three victims are teaming up and suing the platforms for allegedly providing material support to the Islamic State.
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:37.924]  We have been reporting on ISIS or radical Islam's use of these social network platforms to recruit and spread its propaganda, mostly in the light of the hypocritical sense that you can be centered on Facebook or Twitter for being a conservative, sharing InfoWars links, speaking bad about Obama, or being a Trump supporter.
[01:31:38.064 --> 01:31:39.584]  But somehow, magically,
[01:31:39.864 --> 01:31:43.947]  Radical Islamic terror groups have managed to continue their usage of these platforms.
[01:31:44.287 --> 01:31:53.473]  But perhaps now, for these double-standard hypocritical companies, the chickens are coming home to roost, as the lawsuit is now making its way to a federal court in eastern Michigan.
[01:31:53.653 --> 01:31:55.895]  This isn't the first time these companies have been sued.
[01:31:56.115 --> 01:32:07.062]  In June, the family of a victim of the Paris attacks sued Facebook, Twitter, and Google for the same reason, allowing a terrorist group to radicalize people on their platform who eventually carry out deadly attacks.
[01:32:07.322 --> 01:32:09.304]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[01:32:10.545 --> 01:32:11.025]  Not a group.
[01:32:11.065 --> 01:32:12.466]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:32:12.506 --> 01:32:13.587]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:32:13.848 --> 01:32:14.768]  Why is this so good?
[01:32:15.049 --> 01:32:20.293]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:32:20.373 --> 01:32:33.945]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:32:33.985 --> 01:32:35.387]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:32:36.147 --> 01:32:37.709]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:32:37.789 --> 01:32:40.292]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:32:40.372 --> 01:32:41.654]  These are all parasites.
[01:32:41.694 --> 01:32:42.795]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:32:42.815 --> 01:32:43.856]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:44.157 --> 01:32:48.482]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:32:48.682 --> 01:32:51.866]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:32:51.906 --> 01:32:55.009]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:55.049 --> 01:32:56.049]  It just came back in yesterday.

[01:33:05.077 --> 01:33:06.958]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:33:07.339 --> 01:33:09.300]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:23.551]  He never gives up.
[01:33:23.651 --> 01:33:25.812]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.032 --> 01:33:30.834]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[01:33:32.555 --> 01:33:35.017]  Mondays through Fridays from 11 a.m.
[01:33:45.727 --> 01:33:45.847]  3 p.m.
[01:33:45.927 --> 01:33:50.771]  Central, we're here, and I've got to just settle down because this type of news drives me crazy.
[01:33:51.231 --> 01:34:13.226]  To witness Nice this summer, to witness Berlin as an 18-wheeler runs over men, women, and children, and to watch the media be apologists and to cover up for orthodox Islam, and to know they knew bringing in millions of military-age men from war-torn areas where their cult is so out of control they're constantly all killing each other.
[01:34:14.358 --> 01:34:16.438]  I mean, I don't want to be in a Jim Jones cult.
[01:34:16.538 --> 01:34:17.899]  I don't want to be in the Islamic cult.
[01:34:18.219 --> 01:34:22.580]  I don't want to go to Arkansas with snake handlers and roll around either.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.080]  I mean, I just don't like cults.
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:36.963]  And I know a cult when I'm looking at one, and the brand of Islam coming out of Saudi Arabia's rear end that's sprayed all over Europe and the rest of the world is a cult.
[01:34:38.343 --> 01:34:40.803]  The only other freakier, weirder one is North Korea.
[01:34:41.544 --> 01:34:43.204]  And I haven't decided which one's worse, quite frankly.
[01:34:44.636 --> 01:34:45.657]  And I can make that judgment.
[01:34:45.917 --> 01:34:47.898]  North Korea is frickin' crazy!
[01:34:49.279 --> 01:34:53.542]  A hereditary dictator that executes family members with mortar fire?
[01:34:54.442 --> 01:34:58.805]  With three days of screaming and crying and worshipping him when he walks around or his dad dies?
[01:34:59.265 --> 01:35:01.807]  I mean, the only time I see this is when Hillary lost.
[01:35:01.867 --> 01:35:09.471]  It was the same... Trump's gonna cut our taxes!
[01:35:10.352 --> 01:35:11.673]  He's gonna murder the gay people!
[01:35:12.915 --> 01:35:15.056]  And the right wing was all like, oh, this is wonderful, we're gonna vote for Trump.
[01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:18.417]  And I was like, he's got rainbow flags at the convention, nobody's ever done that.
[01:35:19.097 --> 01:35:20.877]  He's standing up there being nice to all the gay people.
[01:35:21.137 --> 01:35:23.918]  Now some of the right wing's like, he's not anti-gay, what are we gonna do?
[01:35:24.118 --> 01:35:24.978]  He lied to us!
[01:35:24.998 --> 01:35:25.718]  He never said that.
[01:35:27.319 --> 01:35:30.920]  I mean, I love how the right wing was buying all the left wing's lies, too, about Trump.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:34.421]  And then the left spins it and goes, oh, he conned you, see?
[01:35:34.741 --> 01:35:35.841]  He made you think he was right wing.
[01:35:35.901 --> 01:35:36.381]  No, he didn't!
[01:35:36.401 --> 01:35:38.462]  He's nationalistic.
[01:35:40.883 --> 01:35:42.163]  He's kind of strong man-y.
[01:35:44.724 --> 01:35:49.190]  But compared to globalists trying to destroy the country, I'll take Trump any day.
[01:35:51.412 --> 01:35:55.277]  I mean, he does radical stuff like goes and gives speeches by Christmas trees and says, Merry Christmas.
[01:35:55.538 --> 01:35:58.021]  What type of culture are we in where the president can't say Merry Christmas?
[01:35:58.221 --> 01:36:00.424]  And the media's like, boy, that was extreme.
[01:36:01.325 --> 01:36:01.905]  What next?
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:06.782]  Harold Cilente joins us until the end of the hour.
[01:36:06.902 --> 01:36:13.327]  Then we have Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL expert on the Jihad attack and the Tet-2 soft offensive by Islam we're seeing.
[01:36:14.027 --> 01:36:20.712]  Obviously we're talking about the cold-blooded execution of the Russian ambassador to Turkey, which Russia says is a false flag.
[01:36:21.393 --> 01:36:22.053]  Here it is.
[01:36:22.854 --> 01:36:24.115]  Ambassador assassination.
[01:36:24.155 --> 01:36:25.576]  Russian officials blame NATO.
[01:36:25.876 --> 01:36:27.017]  Turks blame Gulen.
[01:36:28.362 --> 01:36:31.925]  Russian MP blames NATO conspiracy for killing of ambassador in Turkey.
[01:36:32.285 --> 01:36:33.206]  That's out of the Independent.
[01:36:33.226 --> 01:36:34.847]  Yeah, he calls it a false flag.
[01:36:34.867 --> 01:36:38.330]  Both of those terms are now in the vernacular, in the nomenclature.
[01:36:39.190 --> 01:36:43.053]  Putin, Russian ambassador murder aimed at undermining Syria peace process.
[01:36:43.093 --> 01:36:44.394]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[01:36:44.995 --> 01:36:49.298]  Russian officials highly likely ambassador assassination of NATO false flag.
[01:36:49.558 --> 01:36:52.601]  That's InfoWars.com where you actually get what the Russians said.
[01:36:54.673 --> 01:37:02.506]  Continuing, Russian diplomat found dead from a gunshot wound at home just hours after ambassador killed at art exhibition.
[01:37:02.526 --> 01:37:06.612]  Remember Obama said we will counter Russia at the time of our choosing?
[01:37:07.894 --> 01:37:08.514]  That's what you're seeing.
[01:37:08.534 --> 01:37:11.076]  A lot of Russian intelligence operatives.
[01:37:11.096 --> 01:37:12.476]  The head of intelligence has been killed.
[01:37:13.257 --> 01:37:15.738]  They're really trying to start a war with Russia.
[01:37:16.038 --> 01:37:22.341]  And the way to do that, start killing Putin's drivers, start killing the ambassadors, start killing members of the media, then blame it on Putin.
[01:37:22.381 --> 01:37:25.743]  I'm not saying Putin's an angel by any means, but he's not expanding.
[01:37:26.463 --> 01:37:28.824]  He's trying to stabilize Russia, which they don't like.
[01:37:28.844 --> 01:37:32.846]  If they were strong like China, they'd be bullying us like they're doing.
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:36.381]  So that's some of what we've got to break down.
[01:37:37.181 --> 01:37:38.422]  There is so much to go over.
[01:37:38.462 --> 01:37:45.986]  Gerald Salente is one of the top trends forecasters in the world, best-selling author, one of my favorite guys to interview, and one of the audience's favorite guests.
[01:37:46.406 --> 01:37:48.087]  I appreciate him coming on on short notice today.
[01:37:48.107 --> 01:37:50.108]  I just wanted to get him to respond to all this.
[01:37:50.148 --> 01:37:51.529]  TrendsResearch.com.
[01:37:52.249 --> 01:37:54.150]  Gerald, I've got to say you look very, very sharp today.
[01:37:54.730 --> 01:37:59.933]  You always look sharp, but I really, really, really like that style you're kicking today, my friend.
[01:38:00.513 --> 01:38:01.714]  Where would you like to begin?
[01:38:01.774 --> 01:38:04.135]  I mean, what we're seeing with Trump being seated.
[01:38:05.036 --> 01:38:06.637]  If they're this desperate, where are they going?
[01:38:06.817 --> 01:38:08.338]  The ambassadorship?
[01:38:08.818 --> 01:38:10.499]  The latest jihad attack?
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:13.921]  Here's where I like to start.
[01:38:14.841 --> 01:38:16.962]  I like to start with Bill Clinton yesterday.
[01:38:19.844 --> 01:38:23.246]  Trump knows how to get angry white men to vote for him.
[01:38:24.318 --> 01:38:28.239]  I guess maybe he said that, you know, Bill Clinton smoked but he didn't inhale.
[01:38:28.639 --> 01:38:29.819]  Maybe he inhaled.
[01:38:30.699 --> 01:38:37.501]  Because this is from the Trends Journal, the current issue, when we reviewed the election.
[01:38:40.582 --> 01:38:47.823]  Trump received about the same number of white male votes as did Mitt Romney in 2012.
[01:38:47.943 --> 01:38:48.403]  So Bill,
[01:38:52.116 --> 01:38:54.199]  That's why you got the name Slick Willie.
[01:38:54.899 --> 01:38:59.725]  Because you and the rest of the prostitute media are putting out this lie.
[01:39:00.566 --> 01:39:01.507]  Here are the facts.
[01:39:02.008 --> 01:39:05.232]  They're all outlined in the Trends Journal, which you have.
[01:39:06.345 --> 01:39:14.770]  Remember, Trump got the same amount of white male voters as did Mitt Romney in 2012.
[01:39:15.031 --> 01:39:23.036]  We go on to say, despite Hillary Clinton playing the first woman to be elected president gender card,
[01:39:24.175 --> 01:39:30.538]  She received 2 million fewer votes from women than Obama did in 2012.
[01:39:31.378 --> 01:39:38.022]  I'm mentioning this, Alex, because everybody's playing that stupid joke.
[01:39:38.042 --> 01:39:41.643]  The facts are the very same people that elected Obama elected Trump.
[01:39:41.843 --> 01:39:42.624]  They want change.
[01:39:42.664 --> 01:39:43.604]  They want a good economy.
[01:39:43.804 --> 01:39:44.725]  They don't want World War III.
[01:39:45.643 --> 01:39:46.183]  You got it.
[01:39:46.564 --> 01:40:04.775]  So, but they're sending the propaganda that the Russians did it, because maybe, you know, it wasn't the Russians, because if the Russians only had Clinton, how come the Democrats got creamed in the House, lost the Senate, lost the state houses across the country?
[01:40:04.795 --> 01:40:05.956]  Biggest state loss ever.
[01:40:05.976 --> 01:40:08.037]  900 state seats lost.
[01:40:09.130 --> 01:40:09.310]  Right.
[01:40:09.571 --> 01:40:11.534]  Had nothing to do with the Russians.
[01:40:11.995 --> 01:40:14.939]  It had to do with the traitor-in-chief.
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:21.770]  The guy that went around and campaigned... Wait a minute, I burned my toast this morning and the dog ate my homework back in fifth grade.
[01:40:22.031 --> 01:40:23.132]  You're saying that wasn't the Russkies?
[01:40:24.801 --> 01:40:40.288]  Again, it was the traitor-in-chief Obama who lied his way into the office, campaigned more than any other sitting president in modern history for Clinton, going around the country with that arrogant attitude about, hey folks,
[01:40:40.808 --> 01:40:45.910]  Folks, you want to keep my, you want to keep my, folks, you want to keep my legacy alive?
[01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:48.211]  This is what they said to his legacy.
[01:40:48.711 --> 01:40:51.752]  At the Senate, in the House, in all the legislatures.
[01:40:52.012 --> 01:40:59.855]  It had, again, those are the facts, so the people want to talk the Russian crap, and they want to talk about white male votes, just got rid of that one.
[01:41:00.195 --> 01:41:05.837]  Because here's another number, remember, 2 million women, fewer voters than Obama in 2012.
[01:41:08.157 --> 01:41:19.606]  More importantly, just 30% of eligible women cast their ballots for Clinton, compared to 47% who did not vote.
[01:41:20.346 --> 01:41:35.077]  Nothing to do with the Russians, and she's played the gender card, and the women said, because you saw the polls, 60% of the people that went to the polls thought that Clinton was untrustworthy and dishonest.
[01:41:35.077 --> 01:41:37.919]  And by the way, let's go further, because I know you're going off their own mainline polls.
[01:41:38.339 --> 01:41:45.664]  They've been proven to add 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, on average about 9 points more for Hillary in all these polls.
[01:41:45.724 --> 01:41:50.447]  Not just popularity polls, not just voting polls, but all these indexes.
[01:41:50.787 --> 01:41:55.611]  They've also been caught currently trying to hold down Trump's polls, even though they're actually rising.
[01:41:55.931 --> 01:42:03.416]  So the truth is, wasn't this a total repudiation of the mainstream media's credibility, which AP admits was at 6% pre-election?
[01:42:03.776 --> 01:42:04.917]  Might even be negative now.
[01:42:05.798 --> 01:42:06.478]  It might be.
[01:42:07.078 --> 01:42:14.244]  Here, again, these are the facts because everybody's glossing over it, and they give slick Willie Clinton all this coverage.
[01:42:14.264 --> 01:42:14.764]  Sure, sure.
[01:42:14.784 --> 01:42:18.507]  So how do we counter the claim that it's a white lash, another attempt to race bait?
[01:42:18.547 --> 01:42:18.947]  What do we do?
[01:42:19.628 --> 01:42:24.731]  Right, but again, you keep doing what we're doing, but again, here's the race bait card.
[01:42:24.752 --> 01:42:25.532]  You ready for this one?
[01:42:26.313 --> 01:42:31.977]  Two million, some two million black voters who cast ballots for Obama in 2012?
[01:42:34.497 --> 01:42:36.258]  They didn't cast ballots for Clinton.
[01:42:37.858 --> 01:42:41.540]  So, it has nothing to do with the Russians, it has to do with who they are.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:42.380]  So what do we do?
[01:42:43.201 --> 01:42:47.283]  What we do is, we have to keep calling out the fake media.
[01:42:47.663 --> 01:43:00.889]  Because as soon as Trump got elected, the first day in USA Today, how could a sitting president, who has 74 lawsuits against him, go into the White House, or words to that effect?
[01:43:01.549 --> 01:43:03.750]  This was the coverage after
[01:43:06.678 --> 01:43:07.439]  Obama won.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:10.841]  Look at the coverage.
[01:43:10.901 --> 01:43:15.845]  And for radio listeners, it's the New Yorker with, because most of our audience is radio, we've got to remind folks of that.
[01:43:16.226 --> 01:43:18.988]  It's Obama, it's George Washington, it's all positive.
[01:43:19.428 --> 01:43:21.470]  Obama's loving, he's good, he's an angel.
[01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:23.912]  And now the coverage is Trump's a demon.
[01:43:24.724 --> 01:43:25.184]  That's it.
[01:43:25.324 --> 01:43:27.166]  Look at the hypocrisy of the media.
[01:43:27.466 --> 01:43:30.968]  I think maybe now, maybe Obama's going to play Hamilton, huh?
[01:43:31.609 --> 01:43:33.230]  Yeah, he could probably pull that off.
[01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.990]  Got the wig.
[01:43:34.631 --> 01:43:34.871]  Yeah.
[01:43:34.911 --> 01:43:35.571]  But wait, Gerald.
[01:43:35.631 --> 01:43:38.573]  I've got this super secret photo of the CIA released to Obama.
[01:43:38.593 --> 01:43:39.354]  We're now releasing it.
[01:43:39.374 --> 01:43:40.455]  It's on screen for TV viewers.
[01:43:40.515 --> 01:43:41.295]  Infowars.com.
[01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:42.056]  Vork's last show.
[01:43:42.856 --> 01:43:47.359]  Democrats got this secret photo of a room full of Russian hackers the day before the election.
[01:43:47.399 --> 01:43:52.122]  It's actually 50,000 Trump supporters filling a 50,000 person stadium.
[01:43:52.523 --> 01:43:54.444]  But that was all Russian hackers, Gerald.
[01:43:55.304 --> 01:43:58.826]  Yeah, this is the hypocrisy of the media.
[01:43:59.327 --> 01:44:01.148]  This is the New York Magazine.
[01:44:01.948 --> 01:44:02.548]  All new.
[01:44:02.568 --> 01:44:07.631]  The truly radical politics of Barack Obama.
[01:44:08.291 --> 01:44:13.995]  Look at the hypocrisy of what the media did then and what they're doing now.
[01:44:15.114 --> 01:44:26.522]  So, as we see it, this is going to be one of the biggest changes that we are going to witness in our lifetimes as far as politics.
[01:44:26.863 --> 01:44:28.484]  I want to put this into perspective.
[01:44:29.124 --> 01:44:33.848]  Because we just heard for what, a week and a half, watch out for the Electoral College.
[01:44:34.308 --> 01:44:35.589]  You've been covering it all.
[01:44:35.609 --> 01:44:37.070]  We don't need to go into the details.
[01:44:37.630 --> 01:44:39.772]  They did that for a week and a half.
[01:44:40.252 --> 01:44:43.815]  The two weeks it's been, the Russians are coming, the Russians are coming.
[01:44:44.773 --> 01:44:49.215]  Come January 20th, none of this is going to be important.
[01:44:49.916 --> 01:44:52.697]  A whole new direction is going to take place.
[01:44:53.678 --> 01:44:56.359]  Yes, there's going to be crying by the little liberals.
[01:44:56.379 --> 01:44:58.100]  They're not going to count.
[01:44:59.361 --> 01:45:04.603]  I have never been more positive, and I've been on your show for a decade at least.
[01:45:05.264 --> 01:45:07.405]  I looked it up, about 12 years.
[01:45:08.025 --> 01:45:09.706]  Yeah.
[01:45:09.846 --> 01:45:12.548]  And people would say, oh, that Salenti's a gloom and doomer.
[01:45:13.419 --> 01:45:16.860]  I was a gloom and doomer when the facts were there because here's the facts.
[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:18.321]  Why did Trump win?
[01:45:18.601 --> 01:45:20.761]  We said why back in May.
[01:45:21.142 --> 01:45:22.502]  It's the economy, stupid.
[01:45:23.282 --> 01:45:26.483]  Since Obama's been in, 95% of the wealth has gone to the 1%.
[01:45:26.904 --> 01:45:28.924]  So yes, that's why I'm negative.
[01:45:28.964 --> 01:45:31.005]  And by the way, let me just say this because I'm on the same page.
[01:45:31.505 --> 01:45:35.707]  Just because of optimism, suddenly restaurants are up, suddenly small shops are getting more business.
[01:45:36.307 --> 01:45:37.968]  Over a trillion's been added to the stock market.
[01:45:38.188 --> 01:45:40.048]  He's already bringing back all these massive jobs.
[01:45:40.368 --> 01:45:46.511]  Just on the confidence, it makes the world confident about us, instead of just poo-pooing that we could ever have a future.
[01:45:46.551 --> 01:45:47.331]  We're America!
[01:45:47.791 --> 01:45:49.352]  That's still sexy all over the world.
[01:45:49.632 --> 01:45:51.253]  People want America to come back.
[01:45:51.473 --> 01:45:52.993]  They want America to be successful.
[01:45:53.193 --> 01:45:58.575]  They want the old America that people really did trust, and really did like, that you've been talking about.
[01:45:58.595 --> 01:45:59.896]  So people say, oh Alex,
[01:46:00.296 --> 01:46:01.777]  You know, I thought the government's all evil.
[01:46:01.817 --> 01:46:02.658]  Suddenly you love it.
[01:46:02.758 --> 01:46:03.078]  No!
[01:46:03.438 --> 01:46:08.921]  I'm saying we've got a shot at trying to make it better again and not being the Legion of Doom.
[01:46:09.302 --> 01:46:10.682]  And it's very, very exciting.
[01:46:10.742 --> 01:46:12.063]  And Trump is already delivering.
[01:46:12.363 --> 01:46:16.086]  But he's riding a wave that you predicted two years ago, three years ago.
[01:46:16.426 --> 01:46:17.427]  It was more than that.
[01:46:17.887 --> 01:46:23.230]  How many years ago was it you put out a special issue on nationalism, globalism, and crisis in the next few years?
[01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:27.853]  And I'll be honest, Gerald, I said on air, I hope you're right because I thought you were being too optimistic.
[01:46:28.353 --> 01:46:29.254]  You saw it coming.
[01:46:29.754 --> 01:46:30.955]  Uh, who else saw it coming?
[01:46:31.175 --> 01:46:32.295]  Uh, there was a few others.
[01:46:32.915 --> 01:46:41.019]  Uh, oh, uh, the former head of Black Ops for the, uh, well, really CIA, not just State Department, but Steve Pucinich saw it coming five years ago.
[01:46:41.319 --> 01:46:42.339]  How did you see that coming?
[01:46:43.199 --> 01:46:46.501]  Well, again, because of why the elections are going on around the world.
[01:46:46.521 --> 01:46:47.741]  The people are fed up with the elites.
[01:46:47.761 --> 01:46:49.262]  Yeah, but you saw it before it happened.
[01:46:49.906 --> 01:46:50.866]  How many years ago was that?
[01:46:51.707 --> 01:46:57.489]  Oh, thanks, but that's how it worked, you know, so we try to look beyond what the people are saying and what they're feeling.
[01:46:57.889 --> 01:47:02.471]  So going back to what you were just saying, it's one of our top trends.
[01:47:02.631 --> 01:47:07.312]  Think of Trump's campaign slogan and why we are optimistic about the future.
[01:47:07.792 --> 01:47:09.773]  Make America great again.
[01:47:10.453 --> 01:47:13.454]  So one of our trends are true nostalgia.
[01:47:13.514 --> 01:47:14.795]  When was again?
[01:47:15.415 --> 01:47:17.176]  Look at the difference, for example,
[01:47:17.836 --> 01:47:21.778]  You know, as I mentioned to you on your show, it wasn't that only Clinton got beat.
[01:47:22.559 --> 01:47:32.184]  We saw Obama got beaten, major media got beaten by Trump, the rappers got beaten, Beyonce, the entertainment industry, Hollywood, Silicon Valley.
[01:47:32.204 --> 01:47:34.705]  They threw everything they could against us and they lost.
[01:47:35.946 --> 01:47:36.426]  That's right.
[01:47:36.787 --> 01:47:37.447]  They lost.
[01:47:37.687 --> 01:47:39.068]  Silicon Valley lost.
[01:47:39.108 --> 01:47:40.949]  Now, let's take Silicon Valley.
[01:47:41.269 --> 01:47:46.172]  With that arrogant attitude that they have, they know best, one thinking mind,
[01:47:47.222 --> 01:47:48.563]  Look at the way they dress.
[01:47:48.823 --> 01:47:50.163]  Look at that Zuckerberg.
[01:47:50.203 --> 01:47:52.624]  He shows up all the time in a t-shirt.
[01:47:53.364 --> 01:47:55.645]  Look at the way the Trump children dress.
[01:47:56.245 --> 01:47:58.366]  Look at the way Trump puts out things.
[01:47:58.846 --> 01:48:01.187]  Go back to Make America Great Again.
[01:48:01.527 --> 01:48:07.129]  Think of true nostalgia, whatever you want to make it up in your mind, however you want to bring it back.
[01:48:07.149 --> 01:48:07.290]  The 1950s 2.0.
[01:48:09.287 --> 01:48:10.887]  Or, whatever you want it to be.
[01:48:11.087 --> 01:48:12.848]  Elegance, grace, and style.
[01:48:12.908 --> 01:48:27.451]  And you've always obsessed on, if people don't dress nice, and they don't care about their own environment, they don't care about you, and you're right, the slobbishness, well, they declassified the CIA in the 50s and 60s, put out ugly art and ugly architecture to make us feel small and depressed.
[01:48:27.471 --> 01:48:28.331]  That's declassified.
[01:48:28.631 --> 01:48:30.892]  You've always harped on this, and now it's all admitted.
[01:48:30.912 --> 01:48:31.472]  That's a good point.
[01:48:32.406 --> 01:48:34.868]  And now you have Trump presenting it.
[01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:39.373]  Look at his daughters, look at his sons, look at the way they show up.
[01:48:40.333 --> 01:48:48.501]  They're not like... What I'm saying is, for people that want to become entrepreneurs, seize the moment.
[01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:53.606]  Make it new, make it old, retrofit it, do whatever you want to do.
[01:48:53.646 --> 01:48:55.067]  It's energy, it's a spirit we need.
[01:48:56.068 --> 01:48:58.530]  Exactly, and that's what he's bringing back.
[01:48:58.870 --> 01:49:02.152]  But he's not talking about it, it's what he does.
[01:49:02.552 --> 01:49:08.056]  And a number of the people that he's bringing on with them live at that kind of lifestyle.
[01:49:08.616 --> 01:49:18.042]  So what we're saying as trend forecasters is for the people listening, for the people that want to move ahead, seize on what he's doing, play the Trump card.
[01:49:18.343 --> 01:49:21.565]  So for example, let's say you want to make sneakers.
[01:49:22.025 --> 01:49:23.066]  Play the Trump card.
[01:49:23.939 --> 01:49:30.761]  Come out made with pride in America, footwear, whatever, and then start running ads up where Nike is.
[01:49:30.981 --> 01:49:35.303]  If everybody piggybacks on that, you'll have market dominance in just a couple years.
[01:49:35.383 --> 01:49:35.963]  Exactly.
[01:49:35.983 --> 01:49:38.344]  I mean, people ask why my show is so successful.
[01:49:38.764 --> 01:49:39.884]  People want Americana.
[01:49:40.064 --> 01:49:40.845]  They want success.
[01:49:40.885 --> 01:49:43.185]  And if you believe in it, humans can do anything.
[01:49:43.225 --> 01:49:44.106]  It's about confidence.
[01:49:44.426 --> 01:49:46.526]  And globalism was about austerity.
[01:49:46.586 --> 01:49:47.167]  We're poor.
[01:49:47.487 --> 01:49:48.227]  It's all over.
[01:49:48.527 --> 01:49:49.287]  Submit to it.
[01:49:49.367 --> 01:49:50.008]  Go away.
[01:49:50.248 --> 01:49:51.088]  You've got to be poor.
[01:49:51.488 --> 01:49:55.630]  I mean, it ought to be easy for us to beat these people if we simply deliver.
[01:49:55.650 --> 01:49:57.290]  And again, here's the problem.
[01:49:57.690 --> 01:49:58.491]  You're right about all this.
[01:49:58.551 --> 01:49:59.071]  I agree with you.
[01:49:59.851 --> 01:50:01.692]  A huge renaissance is coming back worldwide.
[01:50:01.932 --> 01:50:02.552]  Not just Trump.
[01:50:02.612 --> 01:50:03.573]  He's just riding the wave.
[01:50:04.633 --> 01:50:06.214]  The globalists are going to strike back, Gerald.
[01:50:06.254 --> 01:50:07.234]  Look at their hysteria.
[01:50:07.594 --> 01:50:08.935]  I'm concerned in the next 30 days.
[01:50:08.975 --> 01:50:09.415]  What do you think?
[01:50:10.745 --> 01:50:13.867]  You know, as I said, the next 30 days are important.
[01:50:14.327 --> 01:50:21.972]  But once Trump gets in, the whole scenario of what we're hearing now of all this worthless fake news is going to go away.
[01:50:22.252 --> 01:50:24.694]  But I want to make one point about playing the Trump card.
[01:50:25.794 --> 01:50:26.675]  Look what Trump did.
[01:50:26.715 --> 01:50:27.816]  The first thing he did
[01:50:29.336 --> 01:50:32.058]  During the campaign, he took out the top guy.
[01:50:32.078 --> 01:50:37.020]  He went over to George Bush, put his hand on his shoulder on national television.
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:39.181]  Yeah, you're a nice guy, but you really don't have it.
[01:50:39.682 --> 01:50:41.562]  He knocked out one top guy after another.
[01:50:41.883 --> 01:50:46.245]  So when you're making Pride with America products, you're going to make footwear.
[01:50:46.685 --> 01:50:54.809]  Start running ads up in Oregon and say, hey, Phil Knight, the guy with Nike over there, what are you getting your shoes made from?
[01:50:54.949 --> 01:50:56.870]  Slave labor workers over there.
[01:50:57.210 --> 01:50:58.931]  Bringing him back to America.
[01:50:59.111 --> 01:51:02.553]  Just like he's shaming Boeing to moving a lot of Boeing back.
[01:51:02.653 --> 01:51:03.113]  Exactly.
[01:51:03.373 --> 01:51:07.275]  He's using that bully pulpit and that's what he's supposed to do.
[01:51:07.935 --> 01:51:10.457]  Notice Obama said, oh, what do you have some magic wand?
[01:51:10.477 --> 01:51:13.758]  And of course he did end up having a magic wand, didn't he?
[01:51:14.979 --> 01:51:16.140]  We got to keep this show clean.
[01:51:17.190 --> 01:51:28.317]  No, but what I'm saying is, exactly, I'm saying the magic wand is common sense, saying, hey, if China's got a 15% lower tax than we do, we've got to lower it to that level, and then boom, the jobs come right back.
[01:51:28.357 --> 01:51:29.378]  This is not rocket science.
[01:51:29.827 --> 01:51:42.239]  Yeah, but what I'm saying is for the entrepreneur to play the Trump card, you start going after the people that are importing all these crappy products, marking them up and becoming billionaires.
[01:51:42.259 --> 01:51:42.720]  No, I agree.
[01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:43.140]  I agree.
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:46.183]  I mean, the plan was in the last few decades was just sell out America.
[01:51:46.543 --> 01:51:48.125]  Now the attitude is we're coming back.
[01:51:48.205 --> 01:51:48.906]  So it's that idea.
[01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:50.450]  Exactly.
[01:51:50.490 --> 01:51:55.032]  So what we're saying is to people to seize on the opportunity.
[01:51:55.712 --> 01:51:56.412]  It's there.
[01:51:57.132 --> 01:51:58.553]  And Trump is showing it.
[01:51:58.613 --> 01:51:59.733]  How do they say that in Latin?
[01:52:00.173 --> 01:52:00.794]  Carpe diem?
[01:52:02.354 --> 01:52:02.674]  Yeah.
[01:52:03.535 --> 01:52:04.315]  Seize the moment.
[01:52:05.259 --> 01:52:12.346]  All right, now let me, as I skip the break, I want to take a few calls here and get their ideas on how they think they may try to overthrow Trump before he even gets in.
[01:52:12.506 --> 01:52:13.327]  Look at all they've done.
[01:52:13.747 --> 01:52:17.731]  Past behavior is the greatest indicator of future, you know, performance or behavior.
[01:52:18.071 --> 01:52:23.816]  But I want to just cover a few other little tidbits quickly, boom, boom, boom, with you, from the Trends Journal, Gerald Celinde, TrendsResearch.com.
[01:52:24.929 --> 01:52:25.810]  What about the Fed?
[01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:31.317]  Obviously, they've kept interest rates low forever, but if they raise them, it's a problem if you do, it's a problem if you don't.
[01:52:31.357 --> 01:52:38.405]  But suddenly, because the economy heats up, because of confidence with Trump, it's still in bad trouble, suddenly they want to raise them.
[01:52:38.445 --> 01:52:39.046]  What do you make of that?
[01:52:40.063 --> 01:52:45.467]  I think they're going to raise them, the forecasts are now maybe two times more, and they have to come up.
[01:52:46.108 --> 01:52:56.957]  It's going to, what it's going to do, it's going to hurt mostly the foreign countries, because they borrowed all that money, the emerging markets, particularly China, in cheap dollars.
[01:52:57.717 --> 01:53:02.001]  So now they have to pay them back in dollars, but their currencies are going down.
[01:53:02.021 --> 01:53:09.367]  And now notice the dollar's strong again, it's like a magic switch got thrown when Trump got elected, because I guess it signaled, we're not laying down anymore?
[01:53:10.424 --> 01:53:10.744]  Yes.
[01:53:11.265 --> 01:53:14.387]  And again, look at the people he's bringing in for negotiating.
[01:53:14.867 --> 01:53:18.550]  Whether it's Wilbur Ross, Mnuchin, Tillerson.
[01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:21.972]  I mean, these guys, look at the experience that they have.
[01:53:21.992 --> 01:53:22.433]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:22.453 --> 01:53:23.814]  Folks are saying, oh, more rich people.
[01:53:23.894 --> 01:53:26.856]  It's not rich people that stole the money at hedge funds or whatever.
[01:53:27.056 --> 01:53:31.199]  It's people that actually are the best salesmen in the world that have connections everywhere.
[01:53:31.219 --> 01:53:33.901]  I mean, they say Rex Tillerson is the genius choice.
[01:53:34.935 --> 01:53:43.901]  Again, if they do what they did for their businesses, for we the people, this is the kind of guy I would want to hire.
[01:53:44.261 --> 01:53:48.604]  And all that they have... Well, we shouldn't just hire more lawyers that never did anything?
[01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:49.960]  Yeah, right.
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:51.301]  Or a politician.
[01:53:51.661 --> 01:53:56.022]  By the way, I think politicians should be banned from running for office.
[01:53:56.342 --> 01:53:57.862]  These people never work a day in their lives.
[01:53:57.882 --> 01:53:59.023]  By the way, guess what Rick Sillerson is?
[01:53:59.103 --> 01:53:59.903]  He's an engineer.
[01:53:59.963 --> 01:54:00.343]  That's it.
[01:54:00.563 --> 01:54:02.344]  He started in Texas at oil wells.
[01:54:02.804 --> 01:54:04.644]  Now he runs one of the biggest corporations in the world.
[01:54:05.104 --> 01:54:06.525]  Everybody loves him all over the planet.
[01:54:06.985 --> 01:54:10.086]  And they are so scared right now because they know what this lineup means.
[01:54:10.466 --> 01:54:14.187]  Trump is about to just absolutely dominate
[01:54:15.034 --> 01:54:15.895]  Bringing jobs back.
[01:54:15.975 --> 01:54:27.342]  And again, that's the plan that I was told about even beforehand, which is pretty much the Americana plan, but now it's in, of course, in the whole plan that was put out in the Hollywood Reporter article with Stephen Bannon, the chief advisor.
[01:54:27.663 --> 01:54:29.804]  They know the left is planning to make everybody poor to control them.
[01:54:30.044 --> 01:54:37.389]  They plan to bring in so much wealth that even the poorest people see such big results that they basically turn against collectivism forever.
[01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:42.273]  They're attempting to kill communism, but actually deliver the plan at the end of Lenin
[01:54:43.073 --> 01:54:44.594]  Of the state withering away.
[01:54:44.674 --> 01:54:46.035]  I mean, that's pretty hardcore.
[01:54:47.295 --> 01:54:58.521]  Alex, this is the time for America to become a self-sustaining economy with 320 million people strong.
[01:54:58.541 --> 01:55:03.584]  98% of all the clothes we bring into this country is manufactured overseas.
[01:55:04.944 --> 01:55:07.406]  And people say, well you can't do manufacturing.
[01:55:07.746 --> 01:55:19.593]  Oh yeah, I think there's this country called Germany, and about 25% of their GDP or thereabouts is from manufacturing, and only 11-12% in the United States?
[01:55:19.913 --> 01:55:21.434]  Oh, they can do it, we can't?
[01:55:22.094 --> 01:55:26.337]  Oh, and those manufacturing jobs pay so much higher wages.
[01:55:26.817 --> 01:55:39.085]  So what I'm saying is that everybody out there that wants to take your life into your own hands, if you believe you have the skills and the products, now is the time to make it in America.
[01:55:40.246 --> 01:55:41.207]  What you're saying is so powerful.
[01:55:41.267 --> 01:55:42.007]  Forget Trump.
[01:55:42.408 --> 01:55:48.292]  Whether he delivers or not, we can deliver with the whole message Gerald's been preaching forever that's pure Americana.
[01:55:48.612 --> 01:55:50.713]  And Gerald's been preaching it for 20 plus years.
[01:55:50.733 --> 01:55:55.416]  We're going back to Gerald in a few of your calls from Andrew, Jeremy, Trevor, Jesse, Justin, and others.
[01:55:55.817 --> 01:56:02.761]  But before we do, remember today is the last day in the lower 48 because now the Puzzle Service can deliver by Saturday today to get stuff before Christmas.
[01:56:03.201 --> 01:56:03.822]  We've been hacked.
[01:56:03.842 --> 01:56:04.482]  We've been attacked.
[01:56:04.562 --> 01:56:05.383]  We need the funds.
[01:56:05.763 --> 01:56:08.725]  But we've got great discounts, free shipping storewide, up to 50% off.
[01:56:10.226 --> 01:56:14.389]  A lot of the items, like colloidal silver and other great products.
[01:56:14.429 --> 01:56:19.752]  We do have, of course, the Made in America toothpaste with the colloidal silver.
[01:56:20.312 --> 01:56:23.695]  And, of course, it's also got the iodine in it.
[01:56:23.935 --> 01:56:27.277]  We've lowered the price back down to $9.95 because folks liked it so much at that.
[01:56:27.697 --> 01:56:33.301]  But we have it where you can also support us and get it for $14.95 and help fund the operation.
[01:56:33.341 --> 01:56:35.162]  But it really is a special toothpaste.
[01:56:35.182 --> 01:56:35.762]  It's amazing.
[01:56:36.122 --> 01:56:38.444]  Developed by my dad, a retired dentist and oral surgeon.
[01:56:38.744 --> 01:56:41.006]  Nobody else has got it with cloyal silver and the iodine.
[01:56:41.327 --> 01:56:41.807]  It's amazing.
[01:56:41.827 --> 01:56:42.348]  It turns blue.
[01:56:42.368 --> 01:56:43.369]  It goes from white to blue.
[01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:45.311]  Because real iodine isn't red, it's blue.
[01:56:45.651 --> 01:56:47.112]  And it turns blue in the oxygen.
[01:56:47.593 --> 01:56:48.113]  It's amazing.
[01:56:48.193 --> 01:56:51.977]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:56:52.017 --> 01:56:57.963]  If the store is blocked because of massive communist Chinese hack attacks,
[01:56:58.243 --> 01:57:00.905]  You can always call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:57:00.945 --> 01:57:03.307]  Let's jam in some calls here.
[01:57:03.868 --> 01:57:07.210]  Andrew, what do you think about all they've done to try to block Trump?
[01:57:07.611 --> 01:57:11.334]  Will they try to pull something now in the last 30 days before he's president?
[01:57:12.354 --> 01:57:12.595]  Hello?
[01:57:12.955 --> 01:57:13.495]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[01:57:14.316 --> 01:57:14.897]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:57:15.137 --> 01:57:18.039]  It's a real honor to talk to you and Mr. Salente.
[01:57:18.359 --> 01:57:19.560]  I just wanted to ask you...
[01:57:20.649 --> 01:57:32.117]  Um, do you think they're gonna try and use this, like, thing with Russia to, like, start, like, a war and, like, get in martial law, or is this kinda like a hostage taker pointing a gun at their own head and being like, oh, shoot?
[01:57:32.337 --> 01:57:34.538]  Well, sure, I mean, uh, that's a great question.
[01:57:34.558 --> 01:57:42.584]  I mean, don't you think, that's what the Russians think, that's what everybody else thinks, that this whole assassination of the Russian ambassador is trying to stir up something in the last 30 days with Russia?
[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:44.941]  Okay, well it is.
[01:57:45.722 --> 01:57:51.926]  But people that are concerned about a coup, we talked about the people that Trump brought in on the economic end.
[01:57:52.647 --> 01:57:54.709]  How about all the generals he brought in?
[01:57:54.729 --> 01:58:03.235]  I think that they're planning ahead of time and being proactive in his choices just in case.
[01:58:03.976 --> 01:58:10.762]  They tried to do something to disrupt him getting into office or trying to get him out.
[01:58:10.822 --> 01:58:11.803]  This isn't boasting.
[01:58:11.903 --> 01:58:17.548]  I'm going to just tell the fake left and all you guys want to have some civil war and you got the top killers out running around and stuff.
[01:58:17.948 --> 01:58:22.792]  If you really try martial law, the entire military is just waiting.
[01:58:23.393 --> 01:58:24.033]  Just waiting.
[01:58:24.073 --> 01:58:26.215]  And then you're going to be in a lot of trouble.
[01:58:26.375 --> 01:58:27.736]  And I guess that's what Gerald's getting at.
[01:58:27.776 --> 01:58:28.097]  Right, Gerald?
[01:58:28.797 --> 01:58:31.559]  Yeah, look at the people that he's picked in his cabinet.
[01:58:31.819 --> 01:58:36.022]  You get all these generals, and you have guys that really know the score.
[01:58:36.143 --> 01:58:36.783]  That's right, Andrew.
[01:58:36.803 --> 01:58:38.464]  Yeah, they're pretty freaked out.
[01:58:38.484 --> 01:58:39.705]  They know all those generals are listeners.
[01:58:39.745 --> 01:58:40.926]  I mean, not just Flynn, folks.
[01:58:42.447 --> 01:58:44.028]  Andrew, we appreciate your call.
[01:58:44.108 --> 01:58:44.649]  Great points.
[01:58:44.969 --> 01:58:46.690]  Jeremy and others, we're back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:46.710 --> 01:58:49.212]  A few more minutes with Gerald Cilente, then Roger Stone.
[01:58:50.713 --> 01:58:52.395]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:53.914 --> 01:58:56.235]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:59:00.316 --> 01:59:04.677]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLive.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:59:04.777 --> 01:59:15.719]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:59:15.899 --> 01:59:20.822]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:59:20.942 --> 01:59:23.443]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:59:23.503 --> 01:59:25.004]  It helps detoxify.
[01:59:25.224 --> 01:59:28.066]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:59:28.106 --> 01:59:32.849]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:59:32.889 --> 01:59:39.112]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:59:39.132 --> 01:59:44.455]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:59:44.475 --> 01:59:45.236]  I'm taking it now.
[01:59:46.176 --> 01:59:46.917]  This is so key.
[01:59:47.157 --> 01:59:49.478]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[01:59:49.718 --> 01:59:51.459]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[01:59:51.499 --> 01:59:53.580]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:59.443]  Exclusively available at Infowarslive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:00:01.644 --> 02:00:05.746]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:00:06.286 --> 02:00:07.547]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.961 --> 02:00:32.112]  We gotta get him back up for a full hour.
[02:00:32.132 --> 02:00:37.977]  I know that he's gonna be co-hosting some in January when I am taking an absolutely mandatory
[02:00:39.150 --> 02:00:39.890]  Workstation.
[02:00:41.291 --> 02:00:44.971]  Oh my God, I can interrupt my own intros.
[02:00:45.332 --> 02:00:52.253]  Roger Stone's coming up, Matt Bracken's coming up, Paul Watson hosts the fourth hour from London.
[02:00:53.333 --> 02:00:56.234]  Such an important hour because you get a lot of the news in that hour, not just my babble.
[02:00:56.774 --> 02:00:58.195]  David Knight and others host it.
[02:00:59.835 --> 02:01:00.955]  I want to go to more calls here.
[02:01:01.575 --> 02:01:03.816]  Let's talk to Jeremy in Texas.
[02:01:04.136 --> 02:01:07.777]  What do you think is coming next as a distraction or a way to try to derail Trump?
[02:01:09.446 --> 02:01:12.849]  Alex, I think ultimately the Federal Reserve is going to dump the dollar.
[02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:20.314]  I believe the recent DDoS attack on Infowars was a shot heard around the world.
[02:01:20.955 --> 02:01:28.520]  And it is a warning shot to warn everybody that we can in fact shut down the American grid with the DDoS attack.
[02:01:30.662 --> 02:01:32.703]  That's what I'm thinking in a nutshell.
[02:01:33.364 --> 02:01:37.727]  And it really comes down to the economic
[02:01:38.197 --> 02:01:47.263]  Power shifting, I believe that the elite want to bring chaos naturally, so they've lost total control and they want to hedge everything on chaos.
[02:01:47.363 --> 02:01:54.188]  In fact, FEMA and NASA have been meeting recently in Southern California over potential asteroid strikes.
[02:01:54.348 --> 02:01:56.990]  Oh, they're saying a huge earthquake is way overdue in California.
[02:01:57.010 --> 02:01:57.911]  It's hit everywhere on the Great
[02:01:58.331 --> 02:01:59.052]  We're good to go.
[02:02:17.566 --> 02:02:19.969]  The issue is we have the biggest, one of the biggest companies in the world.
[02:02:19.989 --> 02:02:21.250]  It does MasterCard, Visa, you name it.
[02:02:21.670 --> 02:02:26.795]  They said, don't worry, we flipped on systems that, you know, state sponsors will have trouble bringing down.
[02:02:27.076 --> 02:02:28.157]  Well, they brought it down again.
[02:02:28.257 --> 02:02:34.523]  So it was sophisticated, massive, quadruple pronged, and went over four days, and I'm sure it'll hit again.
[02:02:35.484 --> 02:02:36.085]  Gerald Cilente.
[02:02:37.216 --> 02:02:42.781]  Yes, I want to urge everybody listening to support InfoWars.
[02:02:42.881 --> 02:02:44.603]  Buy the products that they're selling.
[02:02:44.623 --> 02:02:45.684]  They're made in America.
[02:02:45.704 --> 02:02:47.585]  They're made with quality and pride.
[02:02:48.246 --> 02:02:56.433]  And the major media is doing everything they can to sell this lie of fake news when they are the greatest purveyors of it.
[02:02:56.994 --> 02:03:02.659]  So really put your money where your mind is and make this happen because now is our time.
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:15.329]  And as someone once said, it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men.
[02:03:15.429 --> 02:03:16.470]  Samuel Adams.
[02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:19.992]  So everyone out there, do what you can to make all this happen.
[02:03:20.433 --> 02:03:21.394]  Because, you know,
[02:03:22.054 --> 02:03:24.536]  The negatives are there, you know, eliminate them.
[02:03:24.576 --> 02:03:25.857]  Let's hit the positives.
[02:03:26.237 --> 02:03:28.259]  And the positives are we the people.
[02:03:28.619 --> 02:03:30.461]  And now has never been a better time.
[02:03:30.941 --> 02:03:34.204]  As for the dollar, I think it's going to continue to get stronger.
[02:03:34.684 --> 02:03:38.727]  You look at the Yuan, they have a... This is where I disagree with Trump, by the way.
[02:03:39.048 --> 02:03:41.550]  The Chinese are not devaluing their currency.
[02:03:41.570 --> 02:03:44.192]  They're doing everything they can trying to prop it up.
[02:03:44.472 --> 02:03:46.854]  They just had 70 billion dollars worth of outflow.
[02:03:46.954 --> 02:03:56.198]  Well, I mean, I agree, but it's still a paradox because when it goes low, it still hurts our manufacturing, but they've so overprinted that it's kind of a, you know, it's damn if you, damn if you don't, but I think you're right.
[02:03:56.639 --> 02:04:01.161]  Real quick, Trevor in Wyoming, I know this is a question you don't want, what's your question or comment for Joel Celente?
[02:04:01.181 --> 02:04:01.661]  Go ahead, Trevor.
[02:04:03.522 --> 02:04:13.907]  It would be about China stockpiling silver and gold over the past decade, and to that same line of thinking is
[02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:28.277]  If they do crash the global market, will they then go to a gold or silver-backed currency that, being that China and India have been buying it up, that they're ultimately going to hold the lion's share?
[02:04:28.297 --> 02:04:31.298]  We're almost out of time.
[02:04:31.318 --> 02:04:32.819]  Sorry to get you guys in short.
[02:04:32.859 --> 02:04:34.000]  Real quick, Gerald, answer to that?
[02:04:34.687 --> 02:04:37.468]  Yeah, well, again, China's reserve currencies are down 20%.
[02:04:37.868 --> 02:04:39.768]  The people are buying gold.
[02:04:39.808 --> 02:04:41.748]  They've driven Bitcoin up 34%.
[02:04:42.589 --> 02:04:45.929]  So you go to where there's India, China, they all want gold.
[02:04:46.009 --> 02:04:51.670]  But the governments are trying to stop them from buying it because they know how worthless their currencies are.
[02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:54.091]  But regardless, there'll be ups and downs.
[02:04:54.431 --> 02:04:57.311]  But the long term, we still see gold as a safe haven.
[02:04:57.652 --> 02:04:59.472]  And China and India is the biggest buyers.
[02:05:00.352 --> 02:05:03.074]  It's definitely an interesting time because of the Chinese proverb.
[02:05:03.134 --> 02:05:04.095]  Thank you, Gerald Cilente.
[02:05:04.415 --> 02:05:05.596]  FriendsResearch.com.
[02:05:05.876 --> 02:05:06.316]  Stay with us.
[02:05:06.356 --> 02:05:07.377]  Roger Stone, straight ahead.
[02:05:09.861 --> 02:05:11.482]  Alex, you got it right.
[02:05:12.142 --> 02:05:13.943]  That's exactly what we're seeing.
[02:05:14.724 --> 02:05:16.905]  The mainstream media is dead.
[02:05:17.865 --> 02:05:28.791]  They came out with all this crap about fake news because they're trying to get even with everybody else for all the wrong calls that they've made.
[02:05:29.131 --> 02:05:30.492]  They're declining
[02:05:31.272 --> 02:05:40.456]  Revenues when you're looking at newspapers, the Wall Street Journal's down 40% from what it used to be just within the last three weeks.
[02:05:40.876 --> 02:05:45.038]  You're looking at the ratings going down plummeting after this election.
[02:05:45.418 --> 02:05:48.800]  They're doing this trying to gain loss.
[02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:52.281]  Audiences by attacking other people.
[02:05:52.542 --> 02:06:01.166]  So I want to show you the hypocrisy of these little low lives rather than whether or not you like Trump.
[02:06:01.987 --> 02:06:08.110]  And again, as a political atheist, I look at things to the way they are, not the way they I want them to be.
[02:06:08.670 --> 02:06:11.852]  But also, I'm an American and I'm American first.
[02:06:12.732 --> 02:06:14.513]  So we have a new president.
[02:06:14.533 --> 02:06:20.094]  You may not have liked who got into office, but hey, let's try to make this work the best we can.
[02:06:20.114 --> 02:06:25.236]  One of the victories of Trump is political correctness is dead.
[02:06:25.596 --> 02:06:31.858]  The new president and the burdens that await him, great expectation.
[02:06:31.878 --> 02:06:38.160]  This little clown of a traitor of a man talking about Trump.
[02:06:39.338 --> 02:06:41.879]  Not having the experience to do anything.
[02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:48.483]  Great expectations again from a community organizer that organized nothing.
[02:06:49.203 --> 02:07:02.251]  A little nothing of a man with a bad attitude who learned how to act really well when Oprah Winfrey took her under his arm and made him the great teleprompted president.
[02:07:02.471 --> 02:07:06.113]  Politics is show business for ugly people.
[02:07:06.193 --> 02:07:06.573]  That's right.
[02:07:06.633 --> 02:07:07.834]  We have the proof!
[02:07:08.094 --> 02:07:09.975]  Look at this hypocrisy.
[02:07:10.256 --> 02:07:12.077]  It's the end of politics.
[02:07:12.617 --> 02:07:28.529]  Monday, the day before election day, the market closed up 371 points on the anticipation that Clinton would win and that it would be positive for the stock market and it would be
[02:07:29.697 --> 02:07:31.860]  Negative if Trump got in.
[02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:34.683]  And if Trump got in, also it'd be negative for gold.
[02:07:35.424 --> 02:07:37.806]  The reverse is happening.
[02:07:37.967 --> 02:07:40.910]  We're seeing a rally in the stock market like nothing we've seen.
[02:07:41.651 --> 02:07:45.415]  The three of the indexes reaching all-time highs and gold going much lower.
[02:07:46.356 --> 02:07:48.819]  So our forecast is this, and we revised it.
[02:07:50.327 --> 02:07:54.369]  And that is that we're going to see continued growth in the economy.
[02:07:54.429 --> 02:07:56.790]  Trump's policies, a lot of them make sense.
[02:07:56.910 --> 02:08:06.133]  What they're saying about cutting taxes across the board and about renegotiating trade deals overseas is very positive.
[02:08:06.594 --> 02:08:09.595]  Again, there's nothing standing in Trump's way.
[02:08:20.595 --> 02:08:25.076]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:28.356 --> 02:08:33.257]  It's our theme song, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
[02:08:33.757 --> 02:08:38.518]  Yeah, I used to be a really nice guy, but they got a hold of me.
[02:08:39.218 --> 02:08:39.538]  You know what?
[02:08:39.558 --> 02:08:41.499]  I don't care anymore.
[02:08:41.579 --> 02:08:44.879]  I got lots of friends because they read the newspapers, and the newspapers are the enemy.
[02:08:44.899 --> 02:08:47.740]  So if the newspapers are attacking me, I must be a good guy.
[02:08:49.122 --> 02:08:52.585]  That's how little power the establishment has.
[02:08:53.005 --> 02:08:57.449]  The only power they have is to endorse you, and then the public will turn against you.
[02:08:58.190 --> 02:08:59.611]  Donald Trump has learned that.
[02:08:59.871 --> 02:09:00.652]  We've all learned that.
[02:09:01.072 --> 02:09:11.020]  We've seen the entire media establishment do everything they could to defeat Trump, to lie about him, to call him racist, a homophobe, then a Russian agent, a rapist, all of it fake.
[02:09:11.821 --> 02:09:14.503]  And now, he got the 270, well past it, 300 plus.
[02:09:17.358 --> 02:09:25.306]  With the electors yesterday, we're 30 days out from the January 20th Friday event that'll happen in D.C.
[02:09:25.927 --> 02:09:32.194]  and my question is what will they try to pull now or what to look for now from the man
[02:09:32.774 --> 02:09:46.488]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign, and obviously good friends with Trump, former wingman of Trump, who never tells anything Trump told us, just tells us what we should look for coming up in the future.
[02:09:46.869 --> 02:09:48.531]  So he's with us for one segment.
[02:09:48.551 --> 02:09:49.432]  He's been upwriting.
[02:09:49.972 --> 02:09:59.657]  He's a little bit under the weather, but he's here to celebrate with a victory lap the fact that we got the election and now he's gotten the delegates and all the sabotage failed.
[02:09:59.957 --> 02:10:04.399]  So congratulations, Roger Stone, and also to all the listeners for taking action.
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:09.122]  We're the winners in the uphill battle in the election of the century.
[02:10:11.511 --> 02:10:13.673]  Alex, it's great to be with you today.
[02:10:13.793 --> 02:10:19.900]  I got a little bout of food poisoning, but I'm delighted to say that I have rallied.
[02:10:19.980 --> 02:10:30.310]  As you know, I'm kind of hunkered down trying to finish the manuscript for my book, The Making of the President 2016, How Donald Trump Orchestrated an American Revolution.
[02:10:31.808 --> 02:10:33.029]  But you're exactly right.
[02:10:33.209 --> 02:10:35.451]  The coup d'etat has fizzled.
[02:10:36.532 --> 02:10:42.636]  All that sturm und drang about the electors and the harping on the popular vote.
[02:10:43.157 --> 02:10:53.304]  Then the completely phony $3.5 million recount in Wisconsin, which produced nothing but a slight gain for Donald Trump.
[02:10:54.125 --> 02:10:56.506]  And then there was this assault on the electors.
[02:10:56.566 --> 02:11:01.748]  Electors threatened with murder, threatened with violence, threatened to be destroyed.
[02:11:02.508 --> 02:11:04.669]  And they picked up one electorate.
[02:11:04.749 --> 02:11:11.152]  So the score is, I would say, David Brock is now zero for two.
[02:11:11.752 --> 02:11:19.195]  And if I were George Soros, and I had laid out 300, 400 million dollars, I would want my money back.
[02:11:20.103 --> 02:11:26.947]  You know, I don't normally make fun of people's appearances, but he looks like some kind of weird poodle dog or something with that fake Einstein hair.
[02:11:27.327 --> 02:11:32.831]  He just looks like the biggest phony intellectual dumbass the world has ever seen.
[02:11:32.851 --> 02:11:34.512]  This is the supposed brainiac?
[02:11:34.892 --> 02:11:36.193]  I mean, the guy's a complete joke.
[02:11:36.453 --> 02:11:47.520]  He thought demonizing Trump with Alex Jones would make people turn against Trump when all it did was give Trump that allure of true revolutionary sexiness.
[02:11:48.755 --> 02:11:51.076]  Yeah, it was an entire miscalculation.
[02:11:51.156 --> 02:12:06.566]  Somehow the idea that if you smeared Roger Stone, if you smeared Alex Jones, if you smeared the other so-called deplorables, that that would elect Hillary Clinton and erase her various warts and blemishes, which are obviously quite substantial.
[02:12:06.826 --> 02:12:19.754]  And they thought kicking you, in their internal memos and video that we've caught, the MVP of Fox, CNN, MSNBC, officially banned for the last year and a half, that only made you focus on the new media more, and made you even bigger!
[02:12:20.315 --> 02:12:23.177]  So it's so funny, they thought they took you out of the game!
[02:12:24.366 --> 02:12:28.648]  Well, and the irony here now, Alex, is that we're fighting over so-called fake news.
[02:12:29.428 --> 02:12:32.749]  Because I've been subjected to fake news three times in the last week.
[02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:44.454]  First, John Podesta wrote in the Washington Post that I tipped Donald Trump off to Russian hacking by WikiLeaks, a total and complete falsehood.
[02:12:45.194 --> 02:12:56.146]  Uh, then the White House press secretary attacked me by name, suggesting yet again that I told Donald Trump in advance of some Russian hacking.
[02:12:56.546 --> 02:12:57.287]  That's twice.
[02:12:58.108 --> 02:13:00.710]  And now, frankly, with some fulfillment,
[02:13:01.687 --> 02:13:08.929]  PolitiFacts comes forward and they admit, yesterday, no evidence whatsoever of Russian hacking.
[02:13:09.349 --> 02:13:10.869]  Now, that's the fake news.
[02:13:11.749 --> 02:13:30.914]  We are the real news, which is why I urge people to go to the InfoWars site and sign the petition now to make sure the President understands we don't need a civilian censorship board secretly run by the CIA to decide what is and is not real news.
[02:13:31.777 --> 02:13:34.579]  And by the way, I need to call Bannon and people, I've been too busy.
[02:13:34.599 --> 02:13:41.522]  We've mailed the 100,000 signatures that we printed up so that they physically see them to Trump Tower.
[02:13:41.943 --> 02:13:48.586]  So I hope that isn't taken as a giant you-know-what in the punchbowl, but obviously Trump wants to support the free speech and the independent media that helped get him elected.
[02:13:48.846 --> 02:13:53.829]  We're also going to then mail it on to Congress and on to the Congress folks, obviously as a stunt.
[02:13:54.269 --> 02:14:00.093]  to show what's happened, but people can sign the next wave of the petition that we're going to deliver as well at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:14:00.313 --> 02:14:04.877]  There's the main newsletter, then there's also the free speech coalition we founded.
[02:14:04.917 --> 02:14:05.397]  But wow!
[02:14:06.057 --> 02:14:10.901]  So they've graduated from getting caught lying and having no credibility to openly wanting to shut us up.
[02:14:11.261 --> 02:14:14.764]  And even Matt Taibbi of the Rolling Stones said, this is worse than McCarthy.
[02:14:14.824 --> 02:14:15.965]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[02:14:16.305 --> 02:14:17.746]  How do you expect this to play out, Roger?
[02:14:18.817 --> 02:14:20.258]  Yeah, no, Alex is exactly right.
[02:14:20.359 --> 02:14:22.020]  This is the new McCarthyism.
[02:14:22.060 --> 02:14:31.089]  In other words, if you're not for war over Syria, presumably, with the Russians, then you must be a traitor to the country that you love.
[02:14:31.149 --> 02:14:33.711]  You must be a spy for Putin.
[02:14:34.472 --> 02:14:39.777]  It's ironic, is it not, that their whole meme was exactly the same before the election,
[02:14:40.718 --> 02:14:42.059]  As it is after the election.
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:48.644]  You can go to look at back-to-back Washington Post analysis pieces before the election.
[02:14:49.405 --> 02:14:51.587]  Podesta says Stone is a Soviet spy.
[02:14:52.287 --> 02:14:56.170]  After the election, he essentially says Stone is a Soviet spy.
[02:14:56.610 --> 02:14:57.551]  It was a lie then.
[02:14:58.052 --> 02:14:59.012]  It's a lie now.
[02:14:59.032 --> 02:15:00.513]  The great part though, no one buys it.
[02:15:00.574 --> 02:15:01.474]  It's a huge joke.
[02:15:01.895 --> 02:15:03.616]  All over the internet, the memes are incredible.
[02:15:03.716 --> 02:15:04.557]  No one buys it.
[02:15:04.677 --> 02:15:05.157]  No one.
[02:15:06.058 --> 02:15:07.099]  No one though is worse.
[02:15:08.129 --> 02:15:11.030]  Then John Brennan, the CIA director.
[02:15:11.070 --> 02:15:14.271]  First of all, I believe that he is an Islamic sympathizer.
[02:15:14.791 --> 02:15:19.453]  I think that he has been a great proponent of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:15:20.033 --> 02:15:24.215]  He refused to use a Bible to be sworn into his august office.
[02:15:25.335 --> 02:15:29.957]  Many people in intelligence believe that he has himself converted to Wahhabism.
[02:15:30.757 --> 02:15:36.343]  By the way, he was also predicting that the Russians would hack the election before the election.
[02:15:36.843 --> 02:15:37.944]  Now he's saying it again.
[02:15:37.964 --> 02:15:45.892]  That's because Clapper and these others, Dr. James Clapper who runs Defense Intelligence, pointed out that the CIA had no evidence.
[02:15:46.212 --> 02:15:48.975]  That's why Brennan had to jump back in and said, oh yes we do.
[02:15:49.435 --> 02:15:50.116]  But he doesn't.
[02:15:50.837 --> 02:15:51.617]  He needs to go.
[02:15:51.637 --> 02:15:54.981]  The instant Donald Trump is elected, he needs to go.
[02:15:56.121 --> 02:15:57.203]  Well, absolutely.
[02:15:57.243 --> 02:15:59.106]  He is going to be gone, gone, gone.
[02:15:59.466 --> 02:16:01.629]  In the time we have, I want you to rest and get back to the book.
[02:16:02.711 --> 02:16:08.775]  But looking at this, obviously, what else do you think's on POTUS' 45's radar screen?
[02:16:09.235 --> 02:16:12.858]  What are other big issues we've got to look out for as far as appointments?
[02:16:13.498 --> 02:16:16.320]  Other dirty tricks you think they might pull to keep him from getting in there?
[02:16:16.900 --> 02:16:26.207]  Obviously, they're going to want a bunch of hysteria at the inauguration, but it seems like American people, as his poll numbers only go up, get now how pathetic all this is.
[02:16:27.435 --> 02:16:28.716]  Well, two things, Alex.
[02:16:28.936 --> 02:16:34.438]  One, a major story in New York Magazine on the case for impeachment of Donald Trump.
[02:16:35.198 --> 02:16:39.220]  Now, I guess that this is an admission that they're not going to stop his being sworn in.
[02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:50.425]  So therefore, the drumbeat for impeachment over some imagined or manufactured ethical issues appears to me to be a foil.
[02:16:51.025 --> 02:16:55.247]  We also now have a claim of Trump
[02:16:56.267 --> 02:17:00.730]  Saying racially inappropriate things prior to an apprentice taping.
[02:17:01.311 --> 02:17:03.172]  Let's wait and see if there really is a tape.
[02:17:03.733 --> 02:17:07.616]  We heard this canard before during the election.
[02:17:08.136 --> 02:17:13.240]  But they're going to continue to try to delegitimize Trump in any way possible.
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:14.901]  Sure, and it's not vindictiveness.
[02:17:14.941 --> 02:17:20.065]  He's got to go on the offense against the Clintons and all those people that really got money from Russia or they're never going to stop.
[02:17:20.305 --> 02:17:21.746]  I mean, the thing is, he can't just be nice.
[02:17:21.766 --> 02:17:22.587]  They're not going to go away.
[02:17:23.783 --> 02:17:28.046]  Well, plus at the same time, we have our internal battles.
[02:17:28.766 --> 02:17:41.055]  So I read a piece that astounded me in Newsmax the other day that the Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Haass, was destined to be the number two man at the Trump State Department.
[02:17:42.016 --> 02:17:45.018]  Let me just say for the record, don't bet the ranch.
[02:17:47.130 --> 02:17:48.691]  And you've said that about Romney as well.
[02:17:48.771 --> 02:17:50.593]  I know you just imagined it yourself.
[02:17:51.434 --> 02:17:53.876]  Trump was never toying with him like a cat with a mouth.
[02:17:54.356 --> 02:18:03.264]  I love the photo of him at Trump Tower, though, having dinner with Priebus and Romney, and he looks like the cat that just ate the canary, that very cat-like face on Trump.
[02:18:04.024 --> 02:18:13.932]  I just, Alex, I have an instinctual belief that Richard Haass is not going to get this job and that Donald Trump is not going to elevate the head of the CFR to anything.
[02:18:14.793 --> 02:18:22.581]  You know, when I spoke to him last, I can divulge this, I said to him, you've got an awful lot of guys from Goldman Sachs.
[02:18:23.662 --> 02:18:24.904]  And he said, yeah, you know why?
[02:18:25.204 --> 02:18:26.946]  They're really, really smart guys.
[02:18:27.867 --> 02:18:33.452]  But if anybody doesn't think I'm making policy and they're carrying it out, they don't understand why I hired them.
[02:18:34.492 --> 02:18:35.433]  Are you breaking that here?
[02:18:35.453 --> 02:18:38.016]  That is major news.
[02:18:38.336 --> 02:18:39.397]  He's in charge here.
[02:18:39.437 --> 02:18:40.718]  There's no question about it.
[02:18:40.879 --> 02:18:44.723]  And he is seeking out extraordinarily capable people.
[02:18:44.803 --> 02:18:47.145]  Nobody ever said the guys at Goldman are dumb.
[02:18:47.585 --> 02:18:50.148]  They have made billions for their clients.
[02:18:51.905 --> 02:18:54.467]  But the agenda is very clearly Trump's.
[02:18:55.028 --> 02:18:55.929]  Let's add to this.
[02:18:55.989 --> 02:19:00.972]  You know, I gave the analogy and the media made jokes about it saying Alex Jones is worried about Trump and goblins.
[02:19:01.373 --> 02:19:04.936]  No, I said let's say he's in Lord of the Rings and he's got to go into a goblin's nest.
[02:19:04.956 --> 02:19:09.039]  There's a kind of a goblin aide like Gollum that's going to lead him in.
[02:19:09.059 --> 02:19:11.421]  It doesn't mean that he gets in bed with a goblin.
[02:19:11.601 --> 02:19:14.143]  It doesn't mean he marries a goblin or has babies with goblins.
[02:19:14.403 --> 02:19:19.367]  He's going to have to have some Rince Prebyses, Gollum-like creatures and other goblin-like creatures
[02:19:19.847 --> 02:19:28.455]  That are from Mordor that are going to have to lead him around and show him how to get stuff done, where the keys are, where the torches are, you know, how to get stuff done.
[02:19:28.475 --> 02:19:29.857]  And so that's what we see.
[02:19:29.897 --> 02:19:40.727]  And we see him now delivering on his agenda and bringing in outsiders like Rex Tillerson, who is from the corporate world, getting stuff done from the real world, not the fictional world.
[02:19:41.187 --> 02:19:42.829]  And that's really scaring the power structure.
[02:19:43.834 --> 02:19:52.701]  No, I think Trump is intent on recruiting men and women whose focus has been making a profit for their business or for their customers.
[02:19:53.221 --> 02:19:58.485]  Someone who is bottom line oriented because, of course, no one in government cares about the bottom line.
[02:19:58.766 --> 02:19:58.946]  Ever!
[02:19:59.326 --> 02:20:03.469]  Let's expand on this in the few minutes we have left with Roger Stone, who is writing his epic book.
[02:20:03.509 --> 02:20:05.590]  I've already ordered 10,000 of them.
[02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:07.452]  That's how big I think this book's going to be, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:07.652 --> 02:20:09.393]  We normally order like 500 of a book, okay?
[02:20:10.253 --> 02:20:11.454]  So this is going to be huge.
[02:20:11.494 --> 02:20:13.576]  Believe me, I've already been able to see some of it.
[02:20:13.656 --> 02:20:15.237]  It's going to be total inside baseball.
[02:20:15.257 --> 02:20:16.498]  Stuff you're not going to learn anywhere else.
[02:20:16.778 --> 02:20:18.379]  And he's only finishing it in the next week or so.
[02:20:18.399 --> 02:20:19.620]  So you'll get right up until now.
[02:20:20.140 --> 02:20:25.084]  Now, obviously you've talked quite a bit to POTUS, and I'll just leave it at that, or President-elect 45.
[02:20:26.425 --> 02:20:28.026]  What else can you impart to folks?
[02:20:28.046 --> 02:20:30.447]  Because that's... I have vice here, they've asked me twice.
[02:20:31.068 --> 02:20:32.189]  What about Goldman Sachs?
[02:20:32.229 --> 02:20:33.189]  What about Goldman Sachs?
[02:20:33.209 --> 02:20:34.310]  You say Goldman Sachs is bad.
[02:20:34.350 --> 02:20:36.052]  I say, wait, I have Nomi Prins on.
[02:20:36.812 --> 02:20:37.873]  It was a former managing director.
[02:20:38.133 --> 02:20:39.314]  She exposes the globalists.
[02:20:39.574 --> 02:20:40.876]  They get the brightest people.
[02:20:40.936 --> 02:20:45.420]  It's the biggest brokerage bank, you know, state loaning bank in the world.
[02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:48.382]  Obviously, they've got the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[02:20:48.482 --> 02:20:55.829]  I don't like the heads of it, you know, like Corzine and others giving to gun control, giving to carbon taxes.
[02:20:55.929 --> 02:21:00.473]  I'd love to have Trump make them reform themselves, which the president could do.
[02:21:00.893 --> 02:21:02.695]  Obviously, we're going to get the top banking people.
[02:21:03.175 --> 02:21:08.237]  That's who you get to then make them carry out his will to make America great again.
[02:21:08.277 --> 02:21:11.619]  Now if I see gun control or globalism, then I'm going to go completely crazy.
[02:21:11.819 --> 02:21:15.761]  But so far we don't, and you just, you haven't even told me that, and that's amazing.
[02:21:15.961 --> 02:21:21.903]  This new info that he explained himself on that saying, they're going to do my will, they're going to carry out my agenda.
[02:21:22.103 --> 02:21:23.104]  So please elaborate.
[02:21:24.002 --> 02:21:31.404]  Well, Trump has throughout his entire career been a very good judge of character and selected exemplary people to work for him.
[02:21:32.124 --> 02:21:34.144]  And then he backs them up and gives them their head.
[02:21:34.424 --> 02:21:38.925]  This is the way he's always operated in business and it's worked very well for him.
[02:21:39.405 --> 02:21:44.126]  At the same time, making it clear that the agenda is his, that the objectives are his.
[02:21:44.146 --> 02:21:47.847]  And I think that's exactly what we have here.
[02:21:48.787 --> 02:21:57.013]  Meanwhile, he is now in Palm Beach playing a little golf, getting some well-deserved R&R, but still working every day.
[02:21:57.033 --> 02:22:04.078]  He is, I think, was really pumped up about his trip to Alabama and the terrific outpouring there.
[02:22:04.098 --> 02:22:09.221]  We are looking at the inaugural with some excitement.
[02:22:09.361 --> 02:22:13.044]  You know, I don't know if you know this, Alex, but the deplorable
[02:22:14.517 --> 02:22:18.600]  Which was originally scheduled for the Clarendon Ballroom in Roslyn, Virginia.
[02:22:18.660 --> 02:22:20.801]  It got cancelled and they would have copies of the fact.
[02:22:21.762 --> 02:22:25.805]  It has now been resurrected at the National Press Club.
[02:22:26.525 --> 02:22:28.106]  A larger and better venue.
[02:22:28.887 --> 02:22:30.568]  We can accommodate a thousand people.
[02:22:31.288 --> 02:22:32.749]  I will definitely be there.
[02:22:32.769 --> 02:22:34.531]  Alex, I'm inviting you.
[02:22:35.271 --> 02:22:36.772]  This is where the Patriots will be.
[02:22:36.832 --> 02:22:37.052]  I know.
[02:22:37.072 --> 02:22:37.773]  I wasn't going to go.
[02:22:37.793 --> 02:22:40.435]  I kind of decided a week ago not to go just because
[02:22:41.155 --> 02:22:45.976]  It's just, I like to be in Texas, I like to be separate from D.C., but I think I've got to go to the Deplora Ball.
[02:22:45.996 --> 02:22:51.297]  I know I've been invited to some other, obviously, big functions, but my place would be out there in the crowds battling the communists.
[02:22:51.317 --> 02:22:55.438]  But I've got to be honest with you, I get sick of battling the communists, you know what I mean?
[02:22:55.458 --> 02:23:00.900]  Well, there's something to be said for, you know, camaraderie with your fellow patriots.
[02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:03.280]  Because those are the ones you're afraid of.
[02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:05.481]  Absolutely, and there are some lovely patriots as well.
[02:23:06.303 --> 02:23:15.866]  And those who have been in the vanguard of the Trump campaign will be at the Deplora Ball because we can't afford the $25,000 a ticket events for the inaugural committee.
[02:23:16.306 --> 02:23:19.087]  So this is really the people's inaugural event.
[02:23:19.847 --> 02:23:22.868]  And if we're fortunate, some members of the Trump family may drop by.
[02:23:23.429 --> 02:23:24.969]  So I really urge you to make it.
[02:23:24.989 --> 02:23:25.869]  I'm going to be there, Roger.
[02:23:25.889 --> 02:23:26.470]  I'm going to be there.
[02:23:26.530 --> 02:23:30.471]  But I was going to try to leave folks in suspense, but I just can't miss it.
[02:23:31.915 --> 02:23:33.437]  Now, I'm gonna let you go.
[02:23:33.477 --> 02:23:34.338]  I appreciate your time.
[02:23:34.398 --> 02:23:34.979]  Get some rest.
[02:23:35.019 --> 02:23:36.902]  I mean, I know you're texting me at 4 a.m.
[02:23:36.942 --> 02:23:38.204]  and you're texting me at 6 a.m.
[02:23:38.264 --> 02:23:40.647]  and you're working like 20 hours a day, 18 hours a day.
[02:23:41.068 --> 02:23:42.269]  How soon are the big books done?
[02:23:43.393 --> 02:23:46.014]  Well, I'm supposed to turn in a manuscript on Christmas.
[02:23:47.114 --> 02:23:52.476]  Then I've got to do some editing with an idea to get it out the door by January 1st.
[02:23:53.336 --> 02:23:55.977]  Realistically, I would like to make it for the inauguration.
[02:23:56.017 --> 02:23:57.397]  That's what it's currently scheduled.
[02:23:57.937 --> 02:24:01.078]  Still shooting for that, but remains to be seen.
[02:24:01.758 --> 02:24:03.119]  I just would like to be first.
[02:24:03.819 --> 02:24:05.219]  This book will be historic.
[02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:10.561]  You're going to learn things you cannot learn anywhere else about what really happened here.
[02:24:11.677 --> 02:24:16.662]  And this book will be popular with some people and not so popular with others.
[02:24:16.762 --> 02:24:18.123]  I don't want to mention any names.
[02:24:18.623 --> 02:24:19.464]  John Podesta.
[02:24:20.024 --> 02:24:22.126]  But there are people who aren't going to like this book.
[02:24:22.647 --> 02:24:23.327]  Ted Cruz.
[02:24:23.968 --> 02:24:25.889]  And then there's some people who are going to hate this book.
[02:24:26.590 --> 02:24:27.270]  Uma Abedin.
[02:24:27.811 --> 02:24:28.872]  So, stay tuned.
[02:24:30.663 --> 02:24:32.504]  All right, and you've always got such breaking news.
[02:24:32.524 --> 02:24:38.688]  We're going to Matt Bracken here on the Islamic attacks in Europe and more, but you've always got such other big juicy exclusives.
[02:24:39.129 --> 02:24:40.790]  Any other juicy exclusives for us?
[02:24:41.570 --> 02:24:50.056]  I'm going back to the boards here, Alex, and do some writing, but there'll be plenty of revelations in the making of the president, and I thank you for ordering 10,000 copies.
[02:24:50.116 --> 02:24:53.739]  And by the way, we're live and I'm not going to break, so I won't be able to talk to you until tonight.
[02:24:53.759 --> 02:24:54.539]  You'll probably be sleeping.
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:56.741]  Are we still planning on what we're planning next week?
[02:24:57.883 --> 02:25:01.534]  We are, and I will be with you tomorrow, I think, in two segments.
[02:25:02.075 --> 02:25:03.439]  So I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
[02:25:03.460 --> 02:25:04.242]  All right, we'll talk then.
[02:25:04.282 --> 02:25:04.523]  Thank you.
[02:25:04.543 --> 02:25:04.844]  I'll see you.
[02:25:04.864 --> 02:25:05.004]  Bye.
[02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:08.191]  Lots of stuff going on behind the scenes.
[02:25:08.211 --> 02:25:11.253]  All right, there goes Roger Stone from StoneColdTruth.com.
[02:25:11.273 --> 02:25:21.220]  We're getting Matt Brackett on the line right now via video Skype as well to get some more hardcore Islamic attack news and some more of your phone calls for Danny and Ryan and Amy and Rebecca and Rich and folks that are patiently holding.
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:24.782]  Briefly, I get so carried away, I don't even plug my sponsors.
[02:25:25.362 --> 02:25:30.426]  I want to plug Solicitous Science and I'm here again, but I need to get the copy on that great folks as well.
[02:25:30.806 --> 02:25:33.468]  But we also find ourselves independently here internally.
[02:25:34.591 --> 02:25:36.854]  And we bring in a lot more revenue when we discount stuff.
[02:25:36.874 --> 02:25:41.038]  That's why I already try to price stuff without a huge amount of profit.
[02:25:41.058 --> 02:25:50.389]  It's not that profit's bad, but I want you to get a good value at a good price so it's competitive, it's high quality, and so you get a big effect.
[02:25:51.450 --> 02:25:52.811]  So that's why we're doing this.
[02:25:53.572 --> 02:25:55.635]  And I just want to encourage all of you
[02:25:56.988 --> 02:26:01.915]  To take advantage of nutraceuticals that have changed my life and are just simply amazing.
[02:26:02.075 --> 02:26:05.520]  X2, having the good iodine in my body, has totally changed my life.
[02:26:06.341 --> 02:26:08.364]  Having Super Mill Vitality has completely changed it.
[02:26:08.384 --> 02:26:11.148]  The stamina, the libido, the energy.
[02:26:12.435 --> 02:26:19.839]  The Parasite Cleanze, Natural Defense, the other products, the Oxy Powder, all of it are just the very best products out there.
[02:26:19.859 --> 02:26:25.262]  We go out and private label the already best products, best sellers out there that are the highest quality and then discount them.
[02:26:25.342 --> 02:26:30.425]  Or we go out and develop our own systems like DNA Force, Lung Cleanze, and so many other products.
[02:26:30.465 --> 02:26:33.387]  Secret 12, Biome Defense are incredible.
[02:26:33.627 --> 02:26:34.668]  I mean, it's the very best.
[02:26:35.288 --> 02:26:36.689]  We have it in 250 billion cultures.
[02:26:39.244 --> 02:26:39.644]  Thank you.
[02:26:57.057 --> 02:27:01.320]  Hillary for prison 2017 with George Soros as a goblin saying deport him on the back.
[02:27:02.140 --> 02:27:04.522]  We've almost sold out of the Trump is my president red shirt.
[02:27:05.282 --> 02:27:10.085]  We've also got the new shirt Republic Defense Force Citizen Press shirts.
[02:27:10.105 --> 02:27:14.248]  I haven't even talked about those new shirts that just came in and so much more.
[02:27:14.488 --> 02:27:16.930]  We have an entire Made in America line of apparel.
[02:27:18.408 --> 02:27:21.149]  It costs us like $10 to $15 a shirt that we sell for $25.
[02:27:21.209 --> 02:27:24.710]  Or I can just pay for $3 from a shirt from Mexico and sell it for $15.
[02:27:25.531 --> 02:27:25.811]  Or $9.95.
[02:27:26.231 --> 02:27:29.032]  I mean, people just choose the stuff from Mexico or wherever.
[02:27:29.072 --> 02:27:29.532]  That's fine.
[02:27:29.852 --> 02:27:30.812]  We give you the choice.
[02:27:30.932 --> 02:27:35.154]  InfoWarsStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:27:35.194 --> 02:27:35.474]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:27:42.045 --> 02:27:44.627]  And again, my friends, we're under attack.
[02:27:44.907 --> 02:27:46.728]  You know, a lot of folks would bitch and complain about it.
[02:27:47.148 --> 02:27:56.354]  I'm very proud of the fact we have the entire state-run media attacking us, foreign media attacking us, the EU saying shut us down and block us, the Communist Chinese attacking us.
[02:27:56.834 --> 02:27:57.615]  I mean, this is epic.
[02:27:57.655 --> 02:27:58.516]  This is legendary.
[02:27:58.556 --> 02:28:03.158]  We've gone from being huge to just gigantor in our footprint of resistance.
[02:28:03.479 --> 02:28:05.000]  We're still a tiny organization.
[02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:10.502]  The amount of funding we bring in for an organization this powerful is small.
[02:28:10.942 --> 02:28:15.484]  We're huge successes at reaching people, gigantic failures at raising capital.
[02:28:16.325 --> 02:28:30.391]  But we're still kings of raising capital in a system where the big corporations don't give sponsorship to anybody that supports freedom, that supports justice, that supports sovereignty, and who isn't, quite frankly, evil.
[02:28:31.448 --> 02:28:38.013]  So we direct sale products to you because we couldn't expand just off the small sponsors we had.
[02:28:38.493 --> 02:28:39.894]  I'm also very picky about sponsors.
[02:28:40.935 --> 02:28:50.241]  So again, we've been direct selling videos, books, things, you know, that I've produced and written for 20 years, but I've moved into other great products and things.
[02:28:50.281 --> 02:28:53.684]  And we've, we've really created a model here that everybody else is trying to copy.
[02:28:54.471 --> 02:28:57.454]  I'm not bragging, that's the most sincere form of flattery.
[02:28:57.834 --> 02:29:06.041]  I was on national, private, Russian, libertarian TV that's on all over Russia with 40 million viewers a day, today, for an hour.
[02:29:06.782 --> 02:29:10.565]  And I was realizing when I was on the show, there was like famous Russians were on the show.
[02:29:11.265 --> 02:29:12.727]  Like advisors to Putin, you name it.
[02:29:13.287 --> 02:29:14.909]  And I was sitting there going, oh yeah, I know these guys.
[02:29:16.261 --> 02:29:21.703]  And they were there thanking me for the model and thanking me for, you know, changing the world paradigm.
[02:29:21.963 --> 02:29:26.925]  And it wasn't about my ego, but it was surreal to go, I better do a better job.
[02:29:26.945 --> 02:29:34.869]  Because, see, I hate people thanking me because I'm sitting here thinking how I stumble, how I jibber, how I get obnoxious, how I... But people see the sincerity.
[02:29:35.189 --> 02:29:38.150]  And for whatever reason, we're kicking butt globally.
[02:29:38.530 --> 02:29:43.132]  This message, 1776 Worldwide, isn't about America and some conquest of other countries.
[02:29:43.192 --> 02:29:49.636]  It's about an idea of the Renaissance that came out of America, going global to defeat collectivism.
[02:29:50.336 --> 02:29:51.337]  Say what you want about America.
[02:29:51.377 --> 02:29:54.818]  We are the kings of free market Renaissance in our heyday.
[02:29:55.118 --> 02:29:57.820]  We want to bring that back because it's back to the future.
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:29:59.961]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.441 --> 02:30:02.062]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.962 --> 02:30:05.644]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.734 --> 02:30:12.557]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:19.870]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[02:30:20.591 --> 02:30:24.478]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[02:30:25.425 --> 02:30:27.646]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[02:30:27.726 --> 02:30:28.886]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[02:30:29.566 --> 02:30:32.146]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[02:30:33.087 --> 02:30:33.447]  Or more.
[02:30:33.547 --> 02:30:35.507]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[02:30:35.947 --> 02:30:37.748]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[02:30:38.648 --> 02:30:40.888]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[02:30:40.988 --> 02:30:42.809]  It's actually scary.
[02:30:43.649 --> 02:30:53.651]  And it's because I take products that are researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[02:30:54.707 --> 02:31:07.522]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[02:31:10.319 --> 02:31:19.348]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:31:19.409 --> 02:31:27.477]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:27.817 --> 02:31:32.519]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:31:32.679 --> 02:31:39.402]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:39.482 --> 02:31:46.566]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:46.646 --> 02:31:53.509]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:53.669 --> 02:31:58.031]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:31:58.151 --> 02:32:01.412]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:32:01.552 --> 02:32:07.675]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:32:07.855 --> 02:32:09.796]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[02:32:10.296 --> 02:32:14.019]  Look at this nonsense from Darlene Superville of the Associated Press.
[02:32:14.319 --> 02:32:17.741]  Headline reads, Trump blames terrorists for killing in Turkey.
[02:32:17.922 --> 02:32:28.529]  Trump on Monday experienced what life will be like as president as he condemned separate deadly incidents against a Russian diplomat and shoppers at a German Christmas market, blaming Islamic terrorism in both instances.
[02:32:28.729 --> 02:32:30.851]  Finally, a president who calls it like it is.
[02:32:31.051 --> 02:32:33.092]  But wait, that's not how Darlene feels.
[02:32:33.393 --> 02:32:33.833]  She says,
[02:32:34.113 --> 02:32:38.157]  He offered no support for his claims that terrorists were responsible for the carnage.
[02:32:38.437 --> 02:32:39.098]  What was what?
[02:32:39.578 --> 02:32:41.560]  What world are you living in, Darlene?
[02:32:41.940 --> 02:32:46.084]  The shooter literally said Allahu Akbar and said he did this for jihad.
[02:32:46.304 --> 02:32:50.808]  And what other incidents do we know of where crowds of people are run over by a truck?
[02:32:51.028 --> 02:32:58.575]  If 120 people were in a burning building and Trump saved 119 of them, Darlene would write a story saying Trump kills one in structure fire.
[02:32:58.735 --> 02:33:03.178]  This is just like when they scolded Trump for referencing a bomb in New York back in September.
[02:33:03.299 --> 02:33:05.540]  Well, he was right then, and he is right now.
[02:33:05.861 --> 02:33:06.701]  Sorry, Darlene.
[02:33:06.901 --> 02:33:09.383]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[02:33:16.168 --> 02:33:25.996]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:26.536 --> 02:33:28.078]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.638 --> 02:33:33.019]  Yep, but through the storm, you come out on the other side.
[02:33:33.039 --> 02:33:34.120]  Blood on her hands.
[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:35.701]  Drudge always knows how to boil it down.
[02:33:36.101 --> 02:33:37.362]  Berlin market massacre.
[02:33:37.382 --> 02:33:40.603]  Ex-Nazi airport becomes refugee camp.
[02:33:40.803 --> 02:33:43.505]  This is war, says member of their parliament.
[02:33:43.525 --> 02:33:44.886]  Says they're under Islamic attack.
[02:33:45.706 --> 02:34:01.017]  But, we see the leading candidate in the polls for the new president or prime minister of the Netherlands being convicted, what was it, two weeks ago, Gert Wilders, for simply saying, bring in these Moroccans and people, the crime rate's going up.
[02:34:02.218 --> 02:34:12.566]  They've ordered in the Netherlands, in Sweden and in Deutschland, to cover up crime statistics that almost all rapes are by the Islamists.
[02:34:13.442 --> 02:34:17.465]  Because in their culture, if a woman's not covered up, they're fair game.
[02:34:17.725 --> 02:34:19.346]  Then if you rape her, she goes to prison.
[02:34:21.548 --> 02:34:23.530]  Again, this is everything that Matt Bracken...
[02:34:24.795 --> 02:34:25.495]  Has predicted.
[02:34:25.515 --> 02:34:29.317]  If you go to Infowars.com, we have Paul Watson's boil-down and breakdown of this.
[02:34:29.337 --> 02:34:36.381]  Now notice, first they said it was just a truck, it was an accident running over Christmas trees and 60-something people critical and 12 dead.
[02:34:37.141 --> 02:34:40.103]  We had 80-something dead and niece and hundreds injured.
[02:34:40.403 --> 02:34:41.624]  They tried to cover that up as well.
[02:34:41.904 --> 02:34:44.605]  Like San Bernardino, shooting people in front of the Christmas tree.
[02:34:45.606 --> 02:34:48.527]  The husband and wife, the FBI knew was ordered to stand down two years before.
[02:34:48.767 --> 02:34:53.830]  They were going to the Middle East, going to Saudi Arabia, going to Pakistan for training.
[02:34:55.512 --> 02:34:56.093]  It's incredible.
[02:34:56.293 --> 02:34:58.054]  You go to Pakistan for training.
[02:34:58.114 --> 02:34:58.875]  You're a jihadi.
[02:34:58.895 --> 02:35:01.217]  You're on your Facebook talking about how you like ISIS.
[02:35:01.517 --> 02:35:03.479]  We're going to kick your ass out of the country.
[02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:07.262]  If you weren't natural born, I think we should strip your citizenship.
[02:35:08.543 --> 02:35:09.724]  You're a jihadi anchor, baby.
[02:35:09.784 --> 02:35:15.289]  We want to throw you and your family out of here, back to one of the hell holes you came from, where you're all killing each other.
[02:35:17.031 --> 02:35:18.032]  I am sick of this.
[02:35:18.452 --> 02:35:20.494]  Political correctness is not a suicide pact.
[02:35:22.287 --> 02:35:25.509]  So, while Rackman's talking, we're going to show you what the media doesn't want you to see.
[02:35:25.549 --> 02:35:33.953]  Oh, they'll show you fake violence or occasional rare right-wing violence all day, but they don't want you to see these lamas running over people with trucks and all the rest of it.
[02:35:33.973 --> 02:35:35.594]  Just like this guy up in Ohio tried.
[02:35:35.854 --> 02:35:40.016]  When the cops shot him, with the Somali stabbing people, the media said it was racist.
[02:35:41.564 --> 02:35:44.626]  So CNN called the act of terror a truck crash again yesterday.
[02:35:45.086 --> 02:35:45.766]  That was going on.
[02:35:46.467 --> 02:35:50.729]  Berlin truck attacker identified a 23-year-old Pakistani refugee they found with blood all over him.
[02:35:50.969 --> 02:35:53.111]  But now they say they don't think it's him and released him.
[02:35:53.131 --> 02:35:54.732]  Because like I said, bring down Merkel.
[02:35:54.752 --> 02:35:56.673]  So there'll be a catch and release thing now.
[02:35:56.713 --> 02:35:58.614]  I mean, I'm not saying he's 100% guilty.
[02:35:59.214 --> 02:36:00.735]  That's just who the witnesses said and everybody.
[02:36:00.755 --> 02:36:01.575]  And he's all bloody.
[02:36:01.956 --> 02:36:03.477]  And reportedly they said pulled out of the truck.
[02:36:03.497 --> 02:36:04.057]  But you know what?
[02:36:04.817 --> 02:36:06.498]  I'm sure the truck's Megatron.
[02:36:06.518 --> 02:36:07.399]  It did it on its own.
[02:36:09.355 --> 02:36:10.196]  How low can you go?
[02:36:10.376 --> 02:36:13.918]  Ukrainian PM calls Russian ambassador's murder a hero.
[02:36:14.319 --> 02:36:17.201]  That's who Soros has installed in the Ukraine.
[02:36:17.541 --> 02:36:21.724]  CNN again responds to Islamic terror attack in Berlin by blaming conservatives.
[02:36:21.744 --> 02:36:23.505]  We didn't kiss their butts enough.
[02:36:24.046 --> 02:36:25.547]  We told them not to poop in the pool.
[02:36:27.108 --> 02:36:28.329]  These are Merkel's deaths.
[02:36:28.409 --> 02:36:31.071]  German MEP blames Chancellor for refugee attack.
[02:36:33.413 --> 02:36:33.994]  Fake news.
[02:36:34.014 --> 02:36:36.917]  New York Times claims self-driving truck kills not in Berlin.
[02:36:37.217 --> 02:36:37.517]  Yeah!
[02:36:38.138 --> 02:36:39.379]  Even though it wasn't true.
[02:36:39.399 --> 02:36:40.520]  They just make crap up.
[02:36:41.361 --> 02:36:42.402]  This is the enemy media.
[02:36:43.964 --> 02:36:46.927]  Merkel's open-door policy blamed for Berlin truck attack.
[02:36:48.186 --> 02:36:50.208]  German state minister, we're in a state of war.
[02:36:50.528 --> 02:37:00.959]  The interior minister of the German state of Saarland said Tuesday, Germany is in a state of war after a man drove a truck into a crowded Berlin Christmas market, killing 12 people and injuring 48, and suspected terrorist attack.
[02:37:01.279 --> 02:37:03.542]  Beautiful carols, beautiful lights, beautiful trees.
[02:37:05.393 --> 02:37:07.915]  A cultural event running over people.
[02:37:08.356 --> 02:37:14.061]  And oh my gosh, the left, Obama came out after the Ohio attack and said don't blame Islam.
[02:37:14.081 --> 02:37:18.405]  Yeah, don't blame a Somali who was here illegally, who pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:37:19.906 --> 02:37:21.087]  Why do they hate us so much?
[02:37:21.207 --> 02:37:22.509]  Why is the left allied with them?
[02:37:22.949 --> 02:37:24.711]  And now that Trump got the electors,
[02:37:26.319 --> 02:37:27.860]  303 yesterday and 270 needed.
[02:37:28.541 --> 02:37:30.642]  More people went against Hillary than went against him.
[02:37:30.683 --> 02:37:31.523]  Notice how it backfired.
[02:37:31.783 --> 02:37:33.364]  Another repudiation of these people.
[02:37:33.565 --> 02:37:34.245]  They don't care.
[02:37:34.325 --> 02:37:35.166]  I don't think they're going away.
[02:37:36.593 --> 02:37:38.113]  I think you're going to plan something else.
[02:37:38.153 --> 02:37:47.356]  Let's get Matt Bracken's take on all this former Navy SEAL, best-selling author, who I didn't even know about until about a year and a half ago, who got highly recommended by some of my Pentagon sources.
[02:37:47.616 --> 02:37:51.857]  And by the way, I can pick the phone up and call current high-level CIA, current Pentagon.
[02:37:51.917 --> 02:37:54.618]  I can pick up the phone and I'm not going to brag here.
[02:37:54.638 --> 02:37:55.618]  The media goes crazy with it.
[02:37:55.858 --> 02:37:58.099]  Everybody knows who I can talk to, who I do talk to.
[02:37:59.324 --> 02:37:59.584]  Okay?
[02:37:59.964 --> 02:38:03.406]  And let's just say the reason they talk to me is because they know who I talk to.
[02:38:04.207 --> 02:38:07.528]  And I've just been basically told that I've been adopted as the mouthpiece of what's really going on.
[02:38:07.748 --> 02:38:08.789]  I'm not told what to say.
[02:38:09.089 --> 02:38:10.069]  I know what's going on.
[02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.330]  Okay?
[02:38:11.650 --> 02:38:12.311]  I'm not bragging.
[02:38:12.591 --> 02:38:20.255]  I'm telling the listeners, you need to understand, the good news is we'd already be in martial law if it wasn't for about 90% of the military being awake.
[02:38:20.635 --> 02:38:25.297]  And Trump, you know, has put all these generals in knowing they're planning a coup once he gets in or before.
[02:38:25.317 --> 02:38:28.379]  So people are going to say, oh, you're going to back fascism by Trump?
[02:38:29.229 --> 02:38:33.312]  Well, if they try to blow up the White House or something and he arrests a bunch of people, that's not fascism.
[02:38:33.692 --> 02:38:35.674]  We have the tyranny in our country.
[02:38:36.114 --> 02:38:37.375]  We're going to have to remove it.
[02:38:37.455 --> 02:38:40.818]  I don't want to arrest thousands of these people, but they're seditious.
[02:38:41.058 --> 02:38:42.119]  They're not going to stop.
[02:38:42.319 --> 02:38:44.100]  They're calling for killing the president-elect.
[02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:46.802]  I say arrest every damn one of them and charge them.
[02:38:47.102 --> 02:38:50.285]  If I called for killing the president, they'd arrest me, and they should!
[02:38:50.705 --> 02:38:55.368]  Matt Bracken, I mean, people need to understand from my view, we're in the middle of a civil war still.
[02:38:55.409 --> 02:38:55.889]  What do you say?
[02:38:57.034 --> 02:38:57.574]  Definitely.
[02:38:57.674 --> 02:38:58.835]  And it's a dangerous time.
[02:38:59.015 --> 02:39:01.917]  We did hold off their electoral coup.
[02:39:02.417 --> 02:39:06.760]  It even blew back on Hillary, where she lost more electoral votes than Trump did.
[02:39:07.381 --> 02:39:08.741]  But they won't give up.
[02:39:08.861 --> 02:39:09.582]  They never quit.
[02:39:10.322 --> 02:39:12.624]  This is the red-green alliance.
[02:39:12.664 --> 02:39:15.606]  This is Islam and the left allied against civilization.
[02:39:16.306 --> 02:39:18.067]  We see it starkly in Germany.
[02:39:18.628 --> 02:39:23.771]  Even now, they are afraid to name what it is, which is Islamic terror.
[02:39:24.542 --> 02:39:31.047]  Something that all Muslims need to know, all the quote-unquote moderate Muslims, people aren't stupid.
[02:39:31.407 --> 02:39:39.293]  Even though the mainstream media portrayals might make it sound like we're blind and stupid, we understand there's no protesting going on.
[02:39:39.833 --> 02:39:42.615]  Millions come out to protest against Mohammed cartoons.
[02:39:43.076 --> 02:39:45.617]  They don't come out to protest against slaughter in the streets.
[02:39:46.258 --> 02:39:50.121]  And the way that I look at it, the only difference between the moderate Muslims
[02:39:50.837 --> 02:40:03.685]  And the radical Muslims is that the moderate Muslims are just demographically planning to take over as the radicals, you know, are sort of the bad cop in a ongoing good cop, bad cop routine.
[02:40:04.205 --> 02:40:08.387]  The bad cops are blowing up buildings or driving over people with trucks.
[02:40:09.248 --> 02:40:12.530]  And then we're told, don't make the good Muslims mad.
[02:40:13.419 --> 02:40:14.800]  Just give them a little bit more.
[02:40:14.900 --> 02:40:17.982]  What we're seeing now is the extinguishing of Christianity in Europe.
[02:40:18.383 --> 02:40:21.705]  You think there are going to be these Christmas festivals in Europe outside anymore?
[02:40:21.725 --> 02:40:26.568]  And notice the leftists are all trying to sue and ban Christmas trees.
[02:40:26.608 --> 02:40:28.930]  They say don't even hand out Christmas cards, which is your First Amendment.
[02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:31.772]  They're now saying don't even use holiday in the colleges.
[02:40:31.992 --> 02:40:34.474]  The left is synced up trying to extinct Christianity.
[02:40:35.083 --> 02:40:37.985]  Well, and this is the meaning of Islam.
[02:40:38.045 --> 02:40:39.866]  It's not peace, it's submission.
[02:40:40.426 --> 02:40:41.767]  Islam means submission.
[02:40:42.267 --> 02:40:48.251]  You'll get peace, theoretically, after the entire world has submitted to Islam, which I don't plan to do.
[02:40:48.271 --> 02:40:59.317]  The other attack, though, I would like to mention in a minute, the other attack in Ankara, the policeman in his suit, with his ID and his service pistol,
[02:41:00.285 --> 02:41:06.448]  I think that's got the elites way more freaked out than what happened at the Christmas Fair in Berlin.
[02:41:06.728 --> 02:41:19.195]  Well, Russia thinks it's a false flag to try to, and my word from a Pentagon source last week, and I went with it on air, is they're going to try to escalate the Syria thing before Obama leaves, and really try to start a bombing war against Russia.
[02:41:19.215 --> 02:41:20.395]  They're hoping they retaliate.
[02:41:20.695 --> 02:41:24.417]  The word is, and Russia said this, they're going to lay back and wait until Trump gets in.
[02:41:25.057 --> 02:41:25.678]  What's your intel?
[02:41:27.028 --> 02:41:32.292]  Well, I just want to continue on this thought about this assassin that's up on the screen right now.
[02:41:33.333 --> 02:41:39.078]  When the elites are worried, they're not worried about us getting run over in streets or blown up in a cafe.
[02:41:39.098 --> 02:41:40.359]  They could care less.
[02:41:40.399 --> 02:41:41.099]  We're the peasants.
[02:41:41.159 --> 02:41:42.440]  We're outside of the green zone.
[02:41:43.141 --> 02:41:46.304]  We're living out in the hinterland in the Westworld.
[02:41:47.565 --> 02:41:50.287]  They're living inside of the protected perimeter.
[02:41:50.667 --> 02:41:55.691]  So when somebody in a suit and tie with a clean-shaven face walks up and shoots a Tier 1 ambassador,
[02:41:57.172 --> 02:41:59.093]  In the head that gets their attention.
[02:41:59.553 --> 02:42:04.615]  I'll call people's attention also back to previous assassinations by security.
[02:42:05.235 --> 02:42:08.656]  Indira Gandhi was killed by a security guard.
[02:42:09.136 --> 02:42:13.798]  Anwar Sadat was killed by soldiers that jumped out of a truck during a pass-in review.
[02:42:14.538 --> 02:42:24.150]  So, you know, the elites, they start to freak out when they see their own security agents assassinating them from behind, because they're all surrounded by security that they think they can trust.
[02:42:24.170 --> 02:42:24.371]  Well, sure.
[02:42:24.391 --> 02:42:25.592]  I mean, it's normally your security.
[02:42:25.612 --> 02:42:26.854]  People always ask, why don't I get security?
[02:42:27.294 --> 02:42:29.016]  And I said, it's usually your security that kills you.
[02:42:29.337 --> 02:42:30.939]  That's what people contract with to kill you.
[02:42:31.820 --> 02:42:31.920]  Yeah.
[02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:32.981]  And it's, it's, yeah.
[02:42:34.281 --> 02:42:39.287]  Not in all cases, but I mean, they are susceptible to being paid by the highest bidder.
[02:42:39.307 --> 02:42:40.188]  Well, look at RFK.
[02:42:40.228 --> 02:42:42.671]  I mean, that was somebody's security killed him there in LA.
[02:42:42.751 --> 02:42:43.312]  Absolutely.
[02:42:43.732 --> 02:42:45.955]  But what do you think the overall message is?
[02:42:46.015 --> 02:42:53.223]  I mean, the jihadis, I guess, I mean, as you said, they're testing Merkel and others to make sure they sit there and cover up it's Islam.
[02:42:53.484 --> 02:42:54.345]  That's part of their deal.
[02:42:55.706 --> 02:42:55.906]  Right.
[02:42:55.946 --> 02:43:00.030]  Well, if Merkel doesn't resign now, obviously she's never going to resign.
[02:43:00.511 --> 02:43:03.233]  If she's re-elected, then put a fork in Germany.
[02:43:03.914 --> 02:43:06.116]  And as Germany goes, Europe goes.
[02:43:06.397 --> 02:43:10.621]  I read something for Gates of Vienna last year about hybrid vigor.
[02:43:11.502 --> 02:43:17.868]  I don't worry about Germans, but I worry a lot about Islamized Germans, super Germans.
[02:43:18.508 --> 02:43:25.390]  It was the Berbers of Morocco that invaded Spain after they were Islamized and had that convert zeal.
[02:43:25.790 --> 02:43:27.571]  It wasn't the skinny little desert Arabs.
[02:43:28.031 --> 02:43:31.852]  It was the Berbers of Morocco after they had become Islamized.
[02:43:32.413 --> 02:43:35.134]  I fear what will happen when Germans are Islamized.
[02:43:35.654 --> 02:43:42.496]  When all of these German lesbians are suddenly having five or six children, like it or not, that are going to be raised a Muslim.
[02:43:43.396 --> 02:43:46.618]  In one or two generations, Germany could become a powerhouse of Europe.
[02:43:47.098 --> 02:43:48.319]  In a very bad way.
[02:43:48.659 --> 02:43:52.060]  Well, by the way, Islam... I mean, we've got top imams saying it.
[02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:55.302]  We're gonna take the women, we're gonna make our new super Islam people.
[02:43:55.602 --> 02:43:58.343]  Ha ha ha, the men are pigs, they're cowards, they give us their women.
[02:43:58.643 --> 02:44:00.144]  I mean, they're so frickin' arrogant.
[02:44:00.956 --> 02:44:04.417]  Right, but there are heroes in Europe like Geert Wilders.
[02:44:04.837 --> 02:44:07.357]  He is very similar to Trump in this respect.
[02:44:07.917 --> 02:44:10.218]  He understands the media jujitsu.
[02:44:10.698 --> 02:44:19.080]  A year ago, people thought Trump was an idiot for going face-to-face with the mainstream media in ways that weren't flattering to him.
[02:44:19.860 --> 02:44:22.620]  Putting out tweets that people said were stupid or blunders.
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:25.641]  But he was appealing to Joe Blue Collar.
[02:44:25.681 --> 02:44:27.021]  He was appealing to Middle America.
[02:44:27.061 --> 02:44:28.782]  And Geert Wilders is doing the same thing.
[02:44:31.082 --> 02:44:37.964]  These left-wing politicized judges in Holland convict Gert Wilders of saying nasty things about Moroccans.
[02:44:38.444 --> 02:44:39.885]  That just makes him more popular.
[02:44:40.305 --> 02:44:48.667]  So he's understanding this populist jujitsu the way that Trump did, the way that the left in this country is still trying to figure out.
[02:44:49.027 --> 02:44:54.669]  They're still trying to, you know, go back to the old playbook, let's blame it on the Russians or blame it on fake news.
[02:44:55.413 --> 02:44:57.134]  They still don't know what's hitting them.
[02:44:57.554 --> 02:45:01.115]  So there's still a lot of room out here for the populist jiu-jitsu experts.
[02:45:01.635 --> 02:45:08.537]  And I hope the best for Wilders in Holland, I think, his election is in March, February or March.
[02:45:08.977 --> 02:45:11.018]  So we should see a very interesting 2017.
[02:45:12.398 --> 02:45:15.079]  And remember also, in Germany and across Europe,
[02:45:15.862 --> 02:45:21.870]  It's only because of luck and incompetence on the part of these terrorists that there aren't attacks like last night weekly.
[02:45:22.330 --> 02:45:27.377]  And there was a 12-year-old about a week ago who was trying to take a nail bomb and do another festival.
[02:45:28.055 --> 02:45:30.436]  If that had gone off, it would have been another mass process.
[02:45:30.456 --> 02:45:44.919]  By the way, I was told by sources a year ago, it was Christmas again, and then also about six months ago, oh, the Germans keep busting them with big plastic explosive bombs that somebody's giving them in ambulances and stuff, trying to get them into sporting events to blow up a whole crowd.
[02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:51.281]  And sure enough, then it came out in the news that they've busted other ones trying to blow up soccer events.
[02:45:51.341 --> 02:45:53.822]  So, man... They're trying to...
[02:45:56.960 --> 02:46:11.526]  When they owned Mosul, they had a university in an oil region in northern Iraq, and for a couple of years they were churning out university laboratory level chemists.
[02:46:12.386 --> 02:46:12.746]  We're good.
[02:46:30.965 --> 02:46:39.475]  All you need to do is, you know, buy bulk stuff that you can buy at cosmetology stores and supermarkets and so forth, and you can make something as powerful as C4.
[02:46:39.855 --> 02:46:44.220]  That's what blew up the bus and the subway in London, and the train in Madrid.
[02:46:44.260 --> 02:46:45.041]  It's very powerful.
[02:46:45.722 --> 02:46:49.126]  It doesn't have a great shelf life, it's hard to work with, but it's extremely powerful.
[02:46:49.799 --> 02:46:54.200]  And they've got now dozens if not hundreds of these chemists in Europe.
[02:46:54.960 --> 02:46:56.000]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:46:56.080 --> 02:47:06.862]  What is the master plan of the left to bring in 5 million of these people in Europe, hundreds of thousands here, not vet them, get them in as sleeper cells, because from my study they don't totally control the Islamists.
[02:47:07.442 --> 02:47:12.963]  They have some control through rogue groups, the MI6, the Israelis, and the CIA.
[02:47:12.983 --> 02:47:15.844]  Well, I think that they're evil, of course, but
[02:47:17.364 --> 02:47:26.106]  You know, the more naive ones might think that they're going to just ride the tiger of Islam and then, in the wreckage of Europe, establish communism.
[02:47:26.166 --> 02:47:26.506]  Sure.
[02:47:26.626 --> 02:47:32.287]  They're just taking money from Saudi Arabia now because they can live in a bigger apartment or drive a Ferrari.
[02:47:32.327 --> 02:47:40.909]  But the better example, the better paradigm, is Carlos the Jackal, who actually wrote a biography from his prison in France.
[02:47:41.509 --> 02:47:43.391]  Where he is converted to Islam.
[02:47:43.671 --> 02:47:47.574]  He was a communist Bader-Meinhof type guy in the 60s and 70s.
[02:47:47.995 --> 02:48:02.867]  He converted to Islam and he actually wrote a letter to President Obama, which was published, which is pretty amazing, saying that only an alliance between the left and Islam will ever be powerful enough to destroy capitalism and the left.
[02:48:02.947 --> 02:48:22.508]  Let's be clear, the left hates their smartphones, their money, their great medicine, everything, so much, and they love wearing Che Guevara shirts, so much, that they would ally with something that literally keeps women as animals, all because they have some weird hate of the West, and so the mental illness that was implanted in them, where the hell does this come from?
[02:48:22.768 --> 02:48:35.956]  But when it gets to nut-cutting time, when it gets to head-chopping time, history shows conclusively that these guys, like Carlos de Jekyll, they take the easy way and convert to Islam.
[02:48:35.996 --> 02:48:41.820]  Because remember, if you're a totalitarian bastard and you're a man, Islam's not a bad deal.
[02:48:41.860 --> 02:48:45.622]  You get to beat your old lady, you get to rape children.
[02:48:47.038 --> 02:48:53.102]  Marry your cousin's, you know, daughter who's 13 years old and beat her if she doesn't put out?
[02:48:53.503 --> 02:48:59.707]  I mean, so for an evil man, Islam is a pretty easy conversion from being an evil communist.
[02:49:00.188 --> 02:49:05.432]  Now, the commie women, they're the ones that are gonna wake up in a burqa wondering what the heck happened to them.
[02:49:05.692 --> 02:49:19.374]  You know, these German women that aren't making babies will be making babies whether they like it or not if, you know, when Islam succeeds with their, you know, five babies per woman birth rate compared to 1.1, which is... I know.
[02:49:20.155 --> 02:49:22.295]  How did the West teach suicide to its people?
[02:49:22.355 --> 02:49:23.935]  It's just crazy to watch.
[02:49:24.615 --> 02:49:32.957]  Yeah, I... You have to go back to Antonio Gramsci and the Frankfurt Group and the... Who are the guys in England?
[02:49:33.017 --> 02:49:33.137]  The...
[02:49:34.712 --> 02:49:38.675]  Anyway, the communists of the early 20th century... The Fabian socialists, all of them.
[02:49:38.695 --> 02:49:39.236]  The Fabians.
[02:49:40.076 --> 02:49:43.899]  It's going to be the long march through the institutions.
[02:49:43.959 --> 02:49:52.245]  That was the way that war... No, they said it, and they've conquered it, and now they just want to... The weird thing is, you think they took over, they run everything, why would they want to then blow it up?
[02:49:53.526 --> 02:49:57.149]  Well, they thought that they could establish communism, but
[02:49:57.953 --> 02:50:05.035]  As communism has been defeated and pushed back, the only thing that they've got left is this alliance with Islam.
[02:50:05.616 --> 02:50:08.517]  And this is a word of warning to women.
[02:50:09.057 --> 02:50:16.979]  The men who preach communism and pivot to Islam aren't going to see a big decrease in their lifestyle.
[02:50:17.380 --> 02:50:19.620]  They may have two or three women after that.
[02:50:20.241 --> 02:50:24.362]  The women who think that they're going to stick with communism
[02:50:25.231 --> 02:50:26.773]  Are there real fools in this?
[02:50:26.853 --> 02:50:31.537]  Because they're going to wind up in a harem wearing a burqa having five babies, like it or not.
[02:50:31.678 --> 02:50:32.739]  I know, it's so crazy.
[02:50:33.259 --> 02:50:37.423]  They'll only be allowed out if you're a piranha that worships it and helps keep the other women in line.
[02:50:37.443 --> 02:50:38.825]  You'll be kind of the house slave.
[02:50:38.845 --> 02:50:44.170]  We're going to break, come back and take a few final calls and then five minutes to the next hour a few calls and hand the baton to Paul Watson.
[02:50:44.210 --> 02:50:47.794]  I said earlier I would get into the big, you know, white man's guilt secret.
[02:50:49.028 --> 02:50:54.771]  They're spreading this whole thing, like, oh, minorities, it's your time to take over America, and you've got to be communist now, or socialist, that's how you're rebellious.
[02:50:54.891 --> 02:50:55.811]  It's your country.
[02:50:56.112 --> 02:50:58.913]  Don't you want free market, right, self-defense, family?
[02:51:00.054 --> 02:51:01.034]  The globalists hate you.
[02:51:01.594 --> 02:51:04.036]  Adopt free market, be wealthy, be successful.
[02:51:04.476 --> 02:51:06.197]  Don't buy into the globalist paradigm.
[02:51:07.598 --> 02:51:08.278]  It's so incredible.
[02:51:14.443 --> 02:51:17.025]  Now, you wrote last week about a secret agenda.
[02:51:17.085 --> 02:51:21.808]  Are they planning to use Russian interference as an excuse to invalidate Trump's election victory?
[02:51:22.188 --> 02:51:23.729]  Clearly, they're now doing that.
[02:51:24.049 --> 02:51:30.434]  This is a major emergency because the establishment wasn't just going to roll over and die just because Donald Trump won the election.
[02:51:30.834 --> 02:51:34.076]  And I think they've been groping and searching for a way to go after him.
[02:51:34.136 --> 02:51:36.257]  And now they've settled on this Russian angle.
[02:51:36.618 --> 02:51:37.518]  And it's no accident.
[02:51:37.578 --> 02:51:40.060]  In politics, nothing happens by accident.
[02:51:40.280 --> 02:51:44.281]  And it's no accident that all of a sudden Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, U.S.
[02:51:44.341 --> 02:51:53.743]  Senators, the mainstream media, every news outlet, all at once came out with this angle saying the election was not legitimate because Russia helped Donald Trump win the election.
[02:51:53.763 --> 02:51:57.964]  Of course, they offer no proof, just this CIA thing openly on CNN.
[02:51:58.024 --> 02:52:01.865]  An ex-CIA agent openly calling for a new vote.
[02:52:02.185 --> 02:52:06.467]  So this is an extremely dangerous situation because we've already, on Sunday, we had four U.S.
[02:52:06.527 --> 02:52:07.427]  Senators come out.
[02:52:07.527 --> 02:52:08.147]  Two of them
[02:52:08.687 --> 02:52:09.688]  We're Republicans.
[02:52:09.748 --> 02:52:13.430]  John McCain and Lindsey Graham, of course, are openly, they hate Trump.
[02:52:13.450 --> 02:52:14.390]  They can't stand Trump.
[02:52:14.690 --> 02:52:16.951]  And they're openly saying, hey, we've got to investigate this.
[02:52:16.971 --> 02:52:18.792]  We've got to get to the bottom of this right away.
[02:52:19.172 --> 02:52:20.993]  We've got 10 U.S.
[02:52:21.113 --> 02:52:27.517]  electors, members of the Electoral College, led by the daughter of Nancy Pelosi, that are calling on the U.S.
[02:52:27.557 --> 02:52:30.198]  intelligence community to brief electors
[02:52:30.658 --> 02:52:31.999]  About this Russian situation.
[02:53:00.638 --> 02:53:06.183]  I'm going to really just publicly call for Trump to take the gloves off and to come out and excoriate these criminals.
[02:53:06.583 --> 02:53:17.573]  And then the minute he gets into office, the gloves have to come off, brass knuckles have to go on, and we have to go ahead and move forward with grand juries for what's in the WikiLeaks and all the crimes, and we have to start indicting these people.
[02:53:17.933 --> 02:53:20.636]  They're never backing down, and Trump has to run them over!
[02:53:22.051 --> 02:53:27.539]  Yeah, Trump better be ready for the fight of his life, because just because he won the election, that's not the end of the war.
[02:53:27.579 --> 02:53:31.224]  That's the beginning of the war, because now the elite are in full-blown panic mode.
[02:53:31.284 --> 02:53:35.551]  Donald Trump, he's got some allies, but even members of his own party hate him.
[02:53:35.591 --> 02:53:38.375]  There's members of the Senate that hate him, members of the House that hate him.
[02:53:38.735 --> 02:53:50.825]  So if it actually came down to a vote on January 6th, if they blew this thing up and where they're saying, okay, we've got to object to the vote, would the Republican Party automatically support Donald Trump?
[02:53:51.105 --> 02:53:59.812]  Or would there be enough votes joining with the Democrats in the Senate and the House to invalidate his electoral votes and block him from becoming president?
[02:53:59.872 --> 02:54:00.832]  I'm sick of this.
[02:54:00.973 --> 02:54:02.474]  I'm tired of having to fight like this.
[02:54:02.674 --> 02:54:05.236]  But I'm telling you, we're in a maximum emergency.
[02:54:05.316 --> 02:54:07.458]  It's worse than it was five weeks ago.
[02:54:12.523 --> 02:54:15.624]  Alright, we got two more segments left and Paul Watts is taking over from London, England.
[02:54:15.644 --> 02:54:29.671]  I just want to say this, the real discussion going on with white people that I know that are successful in business and life, most of them are married to somebody of another quote race, just a human race, and a lot of them are, is, you know, whites are now 16th or 17th in mobility economically.
[02:54:30.111 --> 02:54:38.215]  Certainly you can say things were geared towards whites 50 years ago or whatever, but most white folks have gotten spoiled if their kids are spoiled, that's why we're not upwardly mobile.
[02:54:39.435 --> 02:54:44.997]  It's, you know, Christian Lebanese or Chinese or whatever that you see at the top of the chart.
[02:54:45.637 --> 02:54:52.940]  But they sell this idea that white people existing is why you're poor, instead of wanting to find out why there was so much wealth and get involved in free market.
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:56.521]  And that's the establishment wanting a permanent underclass.
[02:54:56.921 --> 02:54:58.682]  And they write white papers on it, they admit it.
[02:54:59.082 --> 02:55:04.163]  And that's what's so dastardly about this, is they claim they want you to be successful, but they really just want to control you.
[02:55:04.704 --> 02:55:08.225]  And so now the discussions are, well, the white people didn't have kids and aborted all their kids.
[02:55:09.198 --> 02:55:17.701]  We really all need to really try, even though we're not in power, to try to educate people from the third world that never had this, so the Americana future can go on.
[02:55:17.721 --> 02:55:19.641]  Because people always want to pass something on.
[02:55:19.701 --> 02:55:23.743]  It's like, he used the allegory of a fiction, you know, the Gran Torino.
[02:55:24.023 --> 02:55:30.145]  He didn't like his family, so he, they're all spoiled rotten brats, so he, you know, gives his car away, you know, to the kid he liked next door.
[02:55:30.585 --> 02:55:31.805]  And, you know, it's kind of that way.
[02:55:31.845 --> 02:55:33.646]  You can inherit the West if you want it.
[02:55:34.266 --> 02:55:36.386]  But my God, let's not give it to Radical Islam.
[02:55:36.666 --> 02:55:37.767]  Matt Bracken's our guest.
[02:55:38.187 --> 02:55:41.387]  We should also probably give you his website as well.
[02:55:41.807 --> 02:55:43.568]  EnemiesFarAndDomestic.com.
[02:55:44.208 --> 02:55:47.268]  The Gates of Vienna also is another great site that his work appears on.
[02:55:47.288 --> 02:55:48.288]  You can find his books.
[02:55:49.169 --> 02:55:51.209]  Ryan in Wyoming, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:55:54.629 --> 02:56:01.631]  First of all, I just wanted to say I believe the answer is sovereign men and women in sovereign households becoming self...
[02:56:04.702 --> 02:56:11.724]  Self-sufficient, and your store, your product, X2, water filters, everybody needs to get them.
[02:56:11.764 --> 02:56:15.605]  The point I wanted to bring up was the TET-2 offensive.
[02:56:16.966 --> 02:56:21.507]  In December of 2015, there were hundreds of propane tanks that were stolen.
[02:56:22.047 --> 02:56:27.969]  Also at the same time, there were hundreds of cell phones that were sold and
[02:56:29.392 --> 02:56:32.515]  I just wanted to get Mr. Brackens and... Well, sure.
[02:56:32.595 --> 02:56:38.180]  Clearly there are jihad bases all over the country as sleeper cells that I guess the left can just give its nod.
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:39.422]  They'll start blowing stuff up.
[02:56:39.722 --> 02:56:40.883]  It's like the secret army.
[02:56:40.923 --> 02:56:42.585]  Then they bring in martial law afterwards.
[02:56:42.625 --> 02:56:44.767]  But if Obama's going to do that, he's got 30 days.
[02:56:44.807 --> 02:56:45.407]  Thank you for the call.
[02:56:45.447 --> 02:56:46.188]  Great point, Ryan.
[02:56:46.688 --> 02:56:47.789]  Mr. Bracken, what do you say to that?
[02:56:49.171 --> 02:56:52.754]  Well, you know, I can't rule anything out in terms of that timing.
[02:56:54.249 --> 02:57:10.133]  You know, if an attack of sufficient magnitude happens even under President Trump, it really wouldn't be that much of a different outcome if there's, say, a grid attack, you know, or even just a simple kinetic rifle attack against enough, you know, power substations.
[02:57:11.095 --> 02:57:14.657]  Putting this country into a grid-down scenario is going to be ugly no matter who's in charge.
[02:57:14.997 --> 02:57:16.458]  Same thing with crashing the economy.
[02:57:16.498 --> 02:57:22.200]  Some kind of a cyber attack that tanks out our banking system, destroys the EBT system.
[02:57:22.641 --> 02:57:26.122]  It won't matter if Thomas Jefferson or George Washington are in charge.
[02:57:26.703 --> 02:57:31.485]  There's not going to be an easy solution if the lights go out and our cities explode.
[02:57:32.385 --> 02:57:37.288]  And Soros has doubled the amount of money to domestic destabilization operations, showing they're planning something big.
[02:57:38.010 --> 02:57:40.391]  Right, and the media is going to continue to be their cheerleader.
[02:57:40.431 --> 02:57:51.176]  I mean, I'm watching the media and the only time that you see anything like a hate crime is are these fake hoaxes, you know, the hijab babes that always turn out to be hoaxes.
[02:57:51.196 --> 02:57:54.458]  I mean, every case of Islamists being attacked in America turns out to be fake.
[02:57:55.058 --> 02:57:57.079]  But the media never shows that at all.
[02:57:57.279 --> 02:58:01.201]  Instead, they'll show some, you know, frat brother alleged incident.
[02:58:01.341 --> 02:58:03.202]  Attacks on Islam at record levels.
[02:58:03.262 --> 02:58:04.102]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:58:04.142 --> 02:58:05.083]  It's totally sick.
[02:58:05.283 --> 02:58:07.444]  Well, they've been apologizing for the latest jihad attack.
[02:58:08.106 --> 02:58:10.369]  But the thing is, their power is slipping.
[02:58:10.469 --> 02:58:12.571]  And, you know, Drudge is right.
[02:58:13.012 --> 02:58:13.572]  You're right.
[02:58:15.054 --> 02:58:17.036]  Other people talking about this are right.
[02:58:17.076 --> 02:58:19.999]  The media is... Julian Assange, he's certainly right.
[02:58:20.039 --> 02:58:21.341]  He says they have less and less credit.
[02:58:21.361 --> 02:58:22.622]  I mean, they just have no pertinence.
[02:58:22.642 --> 02:58:23.664]  They just aren't even on the radar.
[02:58:24.528 --> 02:58:25.329]  That's right.
[02:58:25.790 --> 02:58:27.872]  Your star is rising, and theirs is slipping.
[02:58:27.892 --> 02:58:28.813]  They just don't know it yet.
[02:58:28.874 --> 02:58:30.996]  Isn't it a fun star to be rising, but we're doing our duty.
[02:58:31.056 --> 02:58:32.959]  It's the audience spreading the word, spreading the videos.
[02:58:32.979 --> 02:58:33.820]  People now realize.
[02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:39.006]  I mean, look, the globalists planned a total takeover of the country and basically re-education, telling us what words to use.
[02:58:39.046 --> 02:58:41.389]  So, of course, there was a resistance to that, and now...
[02:58:42.270 --> 02:58:46.658]  If the controllers want to go to the next level, my God, they are going to get their ass stomped.
[02:58:47.079 --> 02:58:52.488]  Back in 70 seconds, we're going to talk to a couple more callers here, Adam in New York and others with Matt Bracken.
[02:58:52.528 --> 02:58:55.053]  Then, Paul Watson takes over from London.

[03:00:00.835 --> 03:00:06.722]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.786 --> 03:00:34.112]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting to the wide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:35.313 --> 03:00:41.056]  Alright, Adam, you're on the air with Matt Bracken.
[03:00:41.716 --> 03:00:42.557]  Welcome, my friend.
[03:00:42.977 --> 03:00:43.317]  Go ahead.
[03:00:44.478 --> 03:00:45.759]  Hi, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:00:45.799 --> 03:00:49.561]  Pretty much my main concern is
[03:00:50.470 --> 03:01:01.143]  Um, with Obama, the transfer of power, I was wondering if you think, um, he'll try to engineer a situation where, you know, he's gotta make the excuse that, uh, he can't handle more power.
[03:01:01.203 --> 03:01:01.984]  I don't know if that would be...
[03:01:02.836 --> 03:01:06.417]  War with Russia, or Syria, some sort of economic...
[03:01:21.343 --> 03:01:22.204]  That's exactly right.
[03:01:22.264 --> 03:01:24.506]  I mean, I can't say more than what you just said.
[03:01:25.446 --> 03:01:28.689]  Prosperity is the best propaganda, for sure.
[03:01:29.230 --> 03:01:31.151]  I was watching Salenti before.
[03:01:31.191 --> 03:01:32.092]  He's absolutely right.
[03:01:32.512 --> 03:01:35.315]  Nothing's going to breed success like economic success.
[03:01:35.775 --> 03:01:41.179]  The problem is that the takedown could be on a global scale, and even Donald Trump.
[03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:45.423]  And no matter who's in charge, no matter what his great policies are,
[03:01:45.923 --> 03:01:48.984]  If there's a global economic crash, Trump will be called the Hoover.
[03:01:49.024 --> 03:01:52.085]  He'll be called, you know, the person that brought on the crash.
[03:01:52.586 --> 03:01:54.486]  And Obama will be the, you know, the wise man.
[03:01:54.546 --> 03:02:00.208]  That's why it's important to let Soros and the Globalists and all of them know, the Davos crew, we're watching you.
[03:02:00.509 --> 03:02:01.329]  We know your tricks.
[03:02:01.369 --> 03:02:02.749]  You're going to be held accountable.
[03:02:03.109 --> 03:02:06.371]  Don't think you're going to run off during New Zealand during some civil war.
[03:02:06.411 --> 03:02:09.612]  We're going to make sure that you get in serious trouble.
[03:02:10.188 --> 03:02:18.132]  Yeah, and as far as some trick where Obama ends up staying in and declaring martial law, I think that's completely out the door now at this point.
[03:02:18.572 --> 03:02:26.916]  And this is one of the things that I, by Trump acting so presidential so early, for example, you know, with the carrier.
[03:02:28.883 --> 03:02:31.685]  Right, and well, he's already in a sense the virtual president.
[03:02:32.085 --> 03:02:38.289]  So anything that happens now, let's say a truck bomb goes off right during the inauguration, you know, it won't stop it.
[03:02:38.710 --> 03:02:44.073]  He's going to be in, you know, if the White House is blown up by... Either they kill him, it's only going to supercharge Americana.
[03:02:44.254 --> 03:02:46.295]  And by the way, he's very fatalistic in a good way.
[03:02:46.595 --> 03:02:47.756]  He's very cheerful about all this.
[03:02:47.796 --> 03:02:49.137]  He's ready to, he's not even scared.
[03:02:50.051 --> 03:02:52.212]  No, I mean, and he does need this.
[03:02:52.232 --> 03:02:54.034]  You know, that's the thing that I come back to.
[03:02:54.574 --> 03:03:01.378]  He's not a power-mad money-grubber like the Clintons, you know, that came out of the, you know, of the, uh, wherever they came from.
[03:03:01.398 --> 03:03:07.883]  Hillary's reportedly basically dying, and she's still money-grubbing six days a week, going around money-grubbing for herself.
[03:03:08.303 --> 03:03:12.846]  She's got hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of Swiss bank accounts, reportedly, and she's money-grubbing.
[03:03:13.447 --> 03:03:20.630]  Donald Trump could have set up trusts where all of his grandchildren for the next, you know, six generations would be millionaires.
[03:03:21.050 --> 03:03:22.651]  He could have retired to an island.
[03:03:23.031 --> 03:03:26.092]  But he risked everything on restoring the republic.
[03:03:26.732 --> 03:03:33.255]  Including knowing that there were going to be some very disgraceful skeletons that had to fall out of the closet like the Billy Bush thing.
[03:03:33.655 --> 03:03:34.856]  He knew that was going to happen.
[03:03:34.876 --> 03:03:36.136]  He knew he was going to get slimed.
[03:03:36.456 --> 03:03:37.717]  So it took a lot of guts.
[03:03:38.217 --> 03:03:42.439]  People with a lot of skeletons in their closets, you know, people say, why don't you run for office?
[03:03:43.288 --> 03:03:44.889]  Skeletons, too many skeletons.
[03:03:46.191 --> 03:03:52.396]  So it takes a lot of guts for a guy like Donald Trump to actually do this, knowing he's going to take all the slings and arrows.
[03:03:52.456 --> 03:03:54.918]  So I do respect and admire him greatly.
[03:03:54.938 --> 03:03:55.478]  Absolutely.
[03:03:55.598 --> 03:03:55.919]  All right.
[03:03:55.999 --> 03:03:58.881]  I'm out of time to Ben and Danny and Jesse and WC.
[03:03:59.461 --> 03:04:00.903]  I really appreciate the callers holding.
[03:04:00.963 --> 03:04:01.583]  I love you to death.
[03:04:01.603 --> 03:04:04.325]  We're going to be back tomorrow live and a lot more.
[03:04:04.385 --> 03:04:06.227]  Paul Watson's about to take over.
[03:04:07.088 --> 03:04:10.671]  But hey, he is now president elect and he's got the Electoral College.
[03:04:11.011 --> 03:04:11.912]  They tried to block it.
[03:04:13.032 --> 03:04:17.775]  This is an incredible time, and all I can say is have a great Christmas and New Year, Mr. Bracken.
[03:04:18.075 --> 03:04:20.997]  We want to thank you for all you do, NA's Foreign and Domestic.com.
[03:04:21.517 --> 03:04:23.718]  I expect to see probably more of these attacks, don't you?
[03:04:24.838 --> 03:04:25.439]  Absolutely.
[03:04:26.960 --> 03:04:30.401]  No doubt, and possibly even attacks from the left at the inauguration.
[03:04:30.421 --> 03:04:38.826]  Can you imagine getting in a country that brought you in as an asylum seeker, gave you food, gave you money, and then you line up an 18-wheeler and run over men, women, and kids?
[03:04:39.625 --> 03:04:46.907]  Well, I understand the Islamic motivation, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see like a left-wing Weather Underground kind of reaction at this point.
[03:04:47.687 --> 03:04:50.188]  You know, the William Ayers type of a thing.
[03:04:50.588 --> 03:04:56.089]  I wouldn't be surprised to see, for example, drones being used to attack the inauguration parade.
[03:04:56.710 --> 03:04:57.290]  Very easy.
[03:04:58.050 --> 03:05:01.151]  And also, I think making themselves victims, I think of false flags in the wind.
[03:05:01.551 --> 03:05:02.451]  We've got to all watch that.
[03:05:02.491 --> 03:05:03.351]  Thank you, Matt Bracken.
[03:05:03.732 --> 03:05:05.472]  Nobody be violent on our side, folks.
[03:05:05.552 --> 03:05:05.952]  Do not.
[03:05:06.072 --> 03:05:06.752]  Be like Gandhi.
[03:05:07.152 --> 03:05:08.393]  I'm going to come introduce Paul Watson.
[03:05:08.413 --> 03:05:08.733]  Stay with us.
[03:05:14.983 --> 03:05:16.124]  Where does it go next?
[03:05:16.184 --> 03:05:19.126]  I mean, we've clearly, Gavin, seen the death of the mainstream media.
[03:05:19.506 --> 03:05:22.868]  Now Obama tells Rolling Stone, we're going to have state-run media.
[03:05:23.129 --> 03:05:25.130]  The state-run media is effective.
[03:05:25.530 --> 03:05:33.916]  I mean, you talk to a Canadian citizen today, and they think Justin Trudeau, their Zoolander prime minister, is doing a great job and is very intelligent.
[03:05:34.176 --> 03:05:39.540]  And you talk to a lot of Brits, not the majority, but you talk to a lot of Brits and they go, oh, Brexit was a catastrophe.
[03:05:39.900 --> 03:05:41.581]  We are a racist country.
[03:05:41.961 --> 03:05:44.003]  And you realize, wow, this propaganda
[03:05:44.463 --> 03:05:49.608]  Really does chip away at someone's ability to rationally think for themselves.
[03:05:49.989 --> 03:05:57.116]  But the beauty of the American phenomenon right now, as Paul Joseph Watson keeps pointing out, is our numbers have gone through the roof.
[03:05:57.536 --> 03:05:59.438]  We won the election.
[03:05:59.818 --> 03:06:01.800]  We are the ones who had the right answers.
[03:06:02.101 --> 03:06:06.685]  And I think the left, after all these lies, the liberals who are watching it went,
[03:06:07.506 --> 03:06:09.207]  You guys have been wrong on a lot of stuff.
[03:06:09.627 --> 03:06:12.609]  I'm gonna look up and see if Trump actually said that.
[03:06:13.109 --> 03:06:17.151]  And once you start, once you open that Pandora's box, there's no coming back.
[03:06:17.873 --> 03:06:24.917]  Even the Washington Post came out last week and said, you know, InfoWars and Breitbart will be Trump's biggest problem because if he doesn't 100% deliver, they're going to turn on him.
[03:06:25.317 --> 03:06:29.660]  They're salivating that the new populist movement is going to turn on Trump.
[03:06:29.740 --> 03:06:30.400]  No, we're not.
[03:06:30.641 --> 03:06:32.001]  We don't expect them to be perfect.
[03:06:32.742 --> 03:06:41.507]  But at the same time, we need to keep his feet to the fire and give him support so that we're his base, so that this avalanche of awakening only continues.
[03:06:41.707 --> 03:06:42.828]  He's already brought Carrier back.
[03:06:43.148 --> 03:06:44.209]  Ford's already coming back.
[03:06:44.509 --> 03:06:46.251]  Apple says, OK, we're looking at coming back.
[03:06:46.771 --> 03:06:47.972]  The stock market's exploding.
[03:06:48.173 --> 03:06:50.294]  He's standing up to the Communist Chinese and their arrogance.
[03:06:50.555 --> 03:06:51.976]  I mean, all I'm seeing is him deliver.
[03:06:52.176 --> 03:06:53.998]  Is he hiring a bunch of former insiders?
[03:06:54.458 --> 03:06:56.380]  Well, who do you think knows how to run the frickin' ship?
[03:06:56.780 --> 03:07:00.864]  If I'd bought a submarine, I'd hire a submarine captain that had run the damn thing before.
[03:07:00.904 --> 03:07:03.386]  They'd say, well, that guy once worked for this bad government.
[03:07:03.726 --> 03:07:06.028]  All I care about is he does what I tell him to do.
[03:07:06.248 --> 03:07:09.071]  Now, we'll see if he goes sideways, but your take on that?
[03:07:10.060 --> 03:07:14.021]  Well, aren't they conceding, by the way, that Infowars and Breitbart are incredibly powerful?
[03:07:15.642 --> 03:07:17.342]  They accidentally do this all the time.
[03:07:17.402 --> 03:07:21.103]  They go out on an attack, and they end up giving you all this credibility.
[03:07:21.403 --> 03:07:25.985]  And I remember you said once, you said, if Trump betrays us, we're going to drag him out of the White House by his heels.
[03:07:27.626 --> 03:07:33.390]  MSNBC, CNN, all these other media sources, they thought they had the power to do that.
[03:07:33.470 --> 03:07:38.394]  They thought they had the power to build a wall around the White House and keep Trump out, and they failed.
[03:07:38.795 --> 03:07:41.137]  And now, God, they're such sore losers.
[03:07:41.177 --> 03:07:42.598]  We're just watching them flail.
[03:07:43.098 --> 03:07:43.598]  And fail.
[03:07:43.738 --> 03:07:44.819]  They've all been in a bubble.
[03:07:45.399 --> 03:07:47.840]  The mainstream media thought they controlled the world.
[03:07:48.120 --> 03:07:51.101]  The celebrities thought people revered them and cared about their opinion.
[03:07:51.361 --> 03:07:52.741]  And they just got a slap in the face.
[03:07:53.221 --> 03:07:55.122]  And you and I get slapped in the face all the time.
[03:07:55.142 --> 03:07:58.703]  So we just go, and we get mad at ourselves for leaving ourselves open in that slap.
[03:07:59.043 --> 03:08:02.164]  They just go, what the hell was that?
[03:08:02.504 --> 03:08:03.885]  That guy slapped police!
[03:08:19.073 --> 03:08:22.995]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:23.795 --> 03:08:28.858]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:32.597 --> 03:08:38.438]  We're back, ladies and gentlemen, trying to restore the republic, trying to save the planet from the eugenicist-based globalists.
[03:08:38.959 --> 03:08:39.799]  We're having a huge effect.
[03:08:39.819 --> 03:08:41.699]  Paul Watson is taking over as we speak.
[03:08:42.139 --> 03:08:53.042]  I wanted to play this clip of the Russian news talking about the fact that Putin, Russian ambassador's murder is a provocation aimed at undermining Syrian peace process.
[03:08:53.162 --> 03:08:54.242]  Very powerful report.
[03:08:54.622 --> 03:09:00.604]  Paul filed on this, breaking it down, that's at InfoWars.com, but here is that report.
[03:09:02.116 --> 03:09:12.463]  Russian Ambassador Andrey Korov was shot dead in a horrific attack in Turkey by a terrorist, upset that Russia had just wiped out jihadist rebels Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Aleppo.
[03:09:12.543 --> 03:09:22.530]  The gunman, a 22-year-old Turkish police officer, confirmed that he was a member of the religion of peace by yelling Allah Akbar twice immediately after the shooting.
[03:09:24.311 --> 03:09:27.993]  He also pledged allegiance to Mohammed in his jihad.
[03:09:28.413 --> 03:09:29.873]  Nothing to do with Islam then.
[03:09:30.034 --> 03:09:37.457]  Reports are circulating that Barack Obama immediately ordered weapons to be delivered to the moderate terrorist who shot the ambassador.
[03:09:37.477 --> 03:09:40.078]  That's what they're actually doing now, escalating the war in Syria.
[03:09:40.138 --> 03:09:44.740]  Now that's just the intro to the Russian ambassador shot dead, what they're not telling you.
[03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:47.341]  Here is the clip from RT that I was mentioning.
[03:09:47.921 --> 03:09:52.503]  Putin, Russian ambassador's murder is a provocation aimed at undermining Syrian peace process.
[03:09:54.563 --> 03:10:09.308]  This murder is clearly a provocation aimed at undermining the improvement and the normalization of the Russian-Turkish relations, as well as at undermining the
[03:10:11.889 --> 03:10:24.118]  Peace process in Syria promoted by Russia, Turkey, Iran and other countries interested in settling this conflict in Syria.
[03:10:25.177 --> 03:10:32.660]  The only response we should offer to this murder is stepping up our fight against terror.
[03:10:33.181 --> 03:10:35.522]  And the criminals will feel the heat.
[03:10:36.102 --> 03:10:41.625]  The Russian investigative committee has already launched an investigation into this killing.
[03:10:41.645 --> 03:10:44.486]  It's been tasked with forming a working group.
[03:10:45.967 --> 03:10:54.491]  Which will have to fly to Ankara and join its Turkish colleagues in jointly investigating this murder.
[03:10:54.931 --> 03:10:59.813]  This is something we agreed on in my telephone conversation with the Turkish president just now.
[03:11:00.213 --> 03:11:02.815]  We have to know who organized the killing.
[03:11:02.835 --> 03:11:03.255]  That's good.
[03:11:03.295 --> 03:11:10.839]  Who gave orders to... Full clips up on Infowars.com and please spread that link to Infowars.com and our backup PrisonPlata.com because
[03:11:12.046 --> 03:11:18.974]  Major state-sponsored organizations do not want you to be able to spread those links in these critical days leading up to Trump's inauguration.
[03:11:19.795 --> 03:11:21.377]  Remember, this isn't happening in a vacuum.
[03:11:21.837 --> 03:11:23.779]  All over the world, globalism is in retreat.
[03:11:24.280 --> 03:11:26.503]  All over the world, globalism is in crisis.
[03:11:27.083 --> 03:11:39.230]  Now joining us is Paul Joseph Watson, one of the hardest working guys out there in media, not just for InfoWars, our MVP, who hosts the show, writes articles, and does research, battles on Twitter and Facebook.
[03:11:39.671 --> 03:11:41.632]  So much happening, but I gotta tell you, it happened.
[03:11:42.372 --> 03:11:43.013]  We've got Trump.
[03:11:43.593 --> 03:11:50.015]  Now basically securing the electoral votes he needs, getting the Electoral College to follow its duty.
[03:11:50.735 --> 03:11:53.896]  Now the media is calling it the anointing of him as if he's not elected.
[03:11:53.916 --> 03:11:58.298]  Do you expect them to back off now or only intensify their operations?
[03:11:58.318 --> 03:12:05.940]  Because the parallels to World War I, trying to start a larger conflict, and the fact that the Russians think NATO's behind this, I absolutely agree.
[03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:07.461]  That's who benefits Kibona.
[03:12:09.141 --> 03:12:11.082]  Well, you asked if they're going to back off.
[03:12:11.342 --> 03:12:13.242]  They've tried five different things, Alex.
[03:12:13.282 --> 03:12:14.463]  They've tried the recount.
[03:12:14.703 --> 03:12:15.823]  They've tried the riots.
[03:12:15.883 --> 03:12:18.564]  They've tried voter intimidation, threatening the electors.
[03:12:18.884 --> 03:12:20.284]  They've tried the fake news narrative.
[03:12:20.304 --> 03:12:21.845]  They've tried the Russian hacking narrative.
[03:12:22.225 --> 03:12:24.886]  Every single one of those five schemes has failed.
[03:12:24.906 --> 03:12:30.568]  You would think by this point they would give up and get tired of miserably failing, but they haven't.
[03:12:30.908 --> 03:12:33.268]  You look at Michael Moore's tweets last night, Alex.
[03:12:33.308 --> 03:12:34.029]  This is his tweet.
[03:12:34.469 --> 03:12:36.689]  He's not president for four and a half weeks.
[03:12:37.090 --> 03:12:37.970]  Next idea?
[03:12:38.550 --> 03:12:43.014]  And then in another tweet he's talking about Trump is not president until 12 noon on January 20th.
[03:12:43.334 --> 03:12:44.656]  We'll continue to fight.
[03:12:45.156 --> 03:12:49.100]  So even though they had the electoral vote, they're still not done.
[03:12:49.480 --> 03:12:54.324]  They're still desperate to sabotage this democratic election any way possible.
[03:12:55.225 --> 03:12:55.685]  We're good to go.
[03:13:21.297 --> 03:13:23.480]  Has come out and said they tried to steal it from Trump.
[03:13:23.761 --> 03:13:25.323]  She even has an HBO documentary.
[03:13:25.844 --> 03:13:27.807]  So the fact is the Democrats are trying to steal this.
[03:13:28.147 --> 03:13:29.689]  Do you think they'll give up?
[03:13:30.090 --> 03:13:30.971]  Are they out of bullets?
[03:13:31.352 --> 03:13:31.873]  What do they do?
[03:13:33.206 --> 03:13:36.528]  Well, they might be figuratively out of bullets, but maybe not literally.
[03:13:36.848 --> 03:13:42.771]  The media has pushed this hysterical narrative that Trump represents a threat to the world for the past six to eight months.
[03:13:43.331 --> 03:13:47.593]  There have already been several assassination attempts on Trump, and I wouldn't be surprised to see another one.
[03:13:47.894 --> 03:13:51.916]  And that will be the media's fake news that radicalizes that shooter.
[03:13:52.216 --> 03:13:54.097]  If that happens, that's a very real threat.
[03:13:54.437 --> 03:13:56.658]  But on top of Michael Moore, Alex, you'll like this.
[03:13:57.178 --> 03:14:01.861]  Glenn Beck is trending at the top of Twitter right now because he's announced an alliance
[03:14:02.321 --> 03:14:07.843]  With the far-left Samantha Bee Comedy Central woman to fight Trumpism.
[03:14:08.324 --> 03:14:18.188]  So this is the guy, Alex, who is notorious, has made a speciality out of stabbing authentic grassroots political movements in the back.
[03:14:18.308 --> 03:14:25.291]  I told people six years ago he was a Trojan horse, an actor, a globalist democratic operative, excited from inside people.
[03:14:25.911 --> 03:14:27.391]  Now it's completely proven.
[03:14:27.751 --> 03:14:30.032]  He is the Judas Iscariot, the Benedict Arnold.
[03:14:30.052 --> 03:14:32.532]  He goes on the news and says, conservatives are fake.
[03:14:32.892 --> 03:14:33.752]  We're frauds.
[03:14:34.032 --> 03:14:34.773]  It's all a scam.
[03:14:34.793 --> 03:14:36.433]  They have these real fake news channels.
[03:14:36.893 --> 03:14:41.454]  Go on NPR and speak for me and go, here's how Alex does it.
[03:14:41.554 --> 03:14:48.095]  So that's all he's got now is going on these shows and groveling and begging for mainstream shows.
[03:14:48.255 --> 03:14:51.796]  I mean, this guy is worse than I ever thought.
[03:14:52.716 --> 03:14:52.996]  Whoa.
[03:14:54.261 --> 03:14:55.522]  That's exactly what it is.
[03:14:55.562 --> 03:15:00.326]  He was sat there with her, groveling, eating cake and talking about how much they have in common.
[03:15:00.506 --> 03:15:02.408]  Well, he knew they were going to install Hillary.
[03:15:02.448 --> 03:15:03.628]  He thought that for sure.
[03:15:03.669 --> 03:15:04.769]  He thought he bet on the good horse.
[03:15:05.050 --> 03:15:06.491]  He knew net censorship was coming.
[03:15:06.811 --> 03:15:08.993]  Drudge was told this too, but came and warned people here.
[03:15:09.373 --> 03:15:11.054]  He was told that they were going to censor.
[03:15:11.094 --> 03:15:12.315]  He decided to roll over.
[03:15:12.876 --> 03:15:14.897]  He was told they were going to shut down the independent press.
[03:15:15.158 --> 03:15:16.699]  He was told they were coming after the alt-right.
[03:15:16.999 --> 03:15:18.280]  He was told Facebook was going to do this.
[03:15:18.440 --> 03:15:21.263]  So he went and met on his belly like a snake.
[03:15:22.124 --> 03:15:23.907]  Crawling to Zuckerberg, remember that?
[03:15:24.589 --> 03:15:28.376]  And so he's chosen to join with Soron.
[03:15:29.534 --> 03:15:34.077]  Yeah, because he stabs authentic grassroots political movements in the back.
[03:15:34.137 --> 03:15:34.717]  That's what he does.
[03:15:34.998 --> 03:15:35.398]  He did it in 2007.
[03:15:36.719 --> 03:15:40.701]  Implied that Ron Paul supporters were domestic terrorists.
[03:15:40.722 --> 03:15:44.684]  In 2012, when Ron Paul ran again, he compared Ron Paul to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:15:44.984 --> 03:15:50.248]  This is a guy who stabs authentic grassroots political movements in the back.
[03:15:50.548 --> 03:15:55.191]  Now, Ron Paul was a lot less on a lower scale than Trump, but same rule applies.
[03:15:55.251 --> 03:15:58.754]  An authentic grassroots... We know that Glenn Beck is literally
[03:15:59.514 --> 03:16:01.055]  The biggest scumbag in America.
[03:16:01.075 --> 03:16:07.138]  Because at least Moore with his six bodyguards that says we can't have guns, you know, you know, is open about his hate of this country.
[03:16:07.779 --> 03:16:11.401]  When you're dealing with somebody like Beck, you are dealing with the ultimate phony.
[03:16:12.061 --> 03:16:13.902]  The ultimate psychopath.
[03:16:13.922 --> 03:16:21.286]  That's why he always acts nice and sweet and cute, because they don't know how to act like that, so they put on this, you know, fake deal like, look, I've got a puppy, I've got candy.
[03:16:21.646 --> 03:16:26.429]  I mean, he is the creepiest guy in those sweaters he wears to all look kind of wimpy on purpose.
[03:16:26.889 --> 03:16:28.252]  I mean, this guy is a predator.
[03:16:28.472 --> 03:16:29.755]  Paul, I'm handing the baton to you.
[03:16:29.795 --> 03:16:30.436]  We salute you.
[03:16:30.717 --> 03:16:32.480]  Have a fabulous Christmas coming up, my friend.
[03:16:33.416 --> 03:16:34.217]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[03:16:34.877 --> 03:16:57.976]  And continuing on that same vein, we've got an article out of the Daily Beast here which I'll get on to read some of, but basically Glenn Beck met up for this little cute seven minute YouTube video with Samantha Bee, the far-left Comedy Central quote comedian, and basically they held hands, they shared a cake, they talked about what they had in common, they talked about forming an alliance,
[03:16:58.797 --> 03:17:05.242]  Again, to sabotage Donald Trump, to fight Trumpism, went into a whole dialogue about how he's gonna...
[03:17:06.345 --> 03:17:08.066]  Destroy freedom of the press.
[03:17:08.106 --> 03:17:09.826]  He's gonna kill the First Amendment.
[03:17:09.866 --> 03:17:11.247]  Again, complete hysteria.
[03:17:11.767 --> 03:17:13.248]  The media's been pushing it for months.
[03:17:13.288 --> 03:17:14.028]  We know it's false.
[03:17:14.528 --> 03:17:22.311]  But again, this is a guy who is notorious for stabbing grassroots, authentic political movements in the back.
[03:17:22.651 --> 03:17:24.352]  You had the Ron Paul movement, 2007.
[03:17:25.653 --> 03:17:26.793]  He got on CNN.
[03:17:26.933 --> 03:17:28.494]  Remember, that's when he was back on CNN.
[03:17:29.534 --> 03:17:35.719]  Said that basically Ron Paul supporters were terrorists, that's what he implied, and that the army should be used against them.
[03:17:36.099 --> 03:17:39.501]  Fast forward to 2012, Ron Paul running for president again.
[03:17:40.062 --> 03:17:43.164]  He said that Ron Paul was like Osama Bin Laden.
[03:17:43.685 --> 03:17:51.911]  Okay, so now you've got the Trump movement, which is an authentic grassroots political movement, albeit on a larger scale than the Ron Paul movement, but same rule applies.
[03:17:52.511 --> 03:17:54.272]  Again, stabbing it in the back.
[03:17:54.913 --> 03:17:57.295]  At the cost of his own audience,
[03:17:58.015 --> 03:18:01.296]  Remember we featured the grass before from TheBlaze.com?
[03:18:01.977 --> 03:18:08.199]  Their traffic since April, May, June of this year is completely falling off a cliff.
[03:18:08.740 --> 03:18:13.041]  Because none of what he is saying resonates with any of his audience.
[03:18:14.102 --> 03:18:20.985]  Which is why, as Alex has said, he's had to worm himself in with people like Zuckerberg, with people on the far left.
[03:18:21.636 --> 03:18:28.039]  Remember, this is a guy who wrote an op-ed for the New York Times saying how great Black Lives Matter was.
[03:18:28.900 --> 03:18:43.468]  This is a movement, Black Lives Matter, whose ideological guru, the name, the woman, they chant her name at every single rally, Assata Shakur, who is a convicted cop killer on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist list.
[03:18:43.848 --> 03:18:44.108]  Okay?
[03:18:44.368 --> 03:18:47.530]  That's your ideological guru of Black Lives Matter.
[03:18:47.870 --> 03:18:53.936]  This is a group whose extremist violent rhetoric has caused terrorist attacks that have killed police officers.
[03:18:54.336 --> 03:18:58.680]  But Glenn Beck comes out and says, no, it's a perfectly rational, reasonable movement.
[03:18:58.700 --> 03:19:00.021]  We need to build bridges with it.
[03:19:00.041 --> 03:19:04.426]  It's like saying, we need to build bridges with the Klan, or with Dylan Roof.
[03:19:05.333 --> 03:19:06.434]  I mean, that's the equivalent.
[03:19:06.514 --> 03:19:08.696]  It's caused violence, it's caused bloodshed.
[03:19:09.196 --> 03:19:13.179]  And then Trump gets up with Samantha Bee for this cute seven minute video.
[03:19:13.879 --> 03:19:18.943]  And they have a meeting of the minds and they eat cake and talk about how bad Donald Trump is.
[03:19:19.444 --> 03:19:23.767]  It's absolutely sickening, but again, no surprise given Glenn Beck's history.
[03:19:24.804 --> 03:19:26.165]  But again, absolutely shocking.
[03:19:26.825 --> 03:19:32.108]  In the next segment, or after the next segment, we're going to talk to Annabelle Schunker about what's taking place in Germany.
[03:19:32.168 --> 03:19:34.010]  She's on the ground there, she's a journalist.
[03:19:34.450 --> 03:19:37.552]  We have ISIS who have just come out and claimed responsibility.
[03:19:37.712 --> 03:19:43.675]  The Islamic State said an Islamic State soldier carried out the attack, so I guess that's nothing to do with Islam.
[03:19:44.476 --> 03:19:52.000]  Of course, today we had the development that the Pakistani refugee they initially arrested, they're now saying it's not him, he had nothing to do with the attack.
[03:19:52.621 --> 03:19:53.922]  Is that part of the cover-up?
[03:19:54.782 --> 03:20:00.045]  If not, then we still have an armed terrorist on the run in Germany.
[03:20:00.405 --> 03:20:02.786]  But ISIS has claimed responsibility for that attack.
[03:20:02.826 --> 03:20:05.748]  We'll be back with more news on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:20:05.788 --> 03:20:06.428]  Don't go away.
[03:20:12.051 --> 03:20:23.437]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for President of the United States and we are going to make our country great again.
[03:20:25.891 --> 03:20:29.316]  They see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump.
[03:20:30.457 --> 03:20:32.239]  The career politicians hate Trump.
[03:20:32.700 --> 03:20:37.266]  It's just awfully good that Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[03:20:39.108 --> 03:20:40.010]  Because you'd be in jail.
[03:20:41.113 --> 03:20:46.777]  Trump's election is going to be the biggest f*** you ever recorded in human history.
[03:20:47.358 --> 03:20:49.679]  You think your business background helps you with campaigning?
[03:20:49.699 --> 03:20:51.260]  I was doing the primaries.
[03:20:51.821 --> 03:20:54.783]  I spent less money than other people and I did better.
[03:20:55.403 --> 03:20:56.804]  And that's what we want to do for the country.
[03:20:56.824 --> 03:20:58.826]  We want to spend less money and do better.
[03:20:59.987 --> 03:21:06.992]  I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.
[03:21:07.212 --> 03:21:08.513]  Hi, this is Ted Cruz calling.
[03:21:19.485 --> 03:21:24.708]  Death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.
[03:21:25.268 --> 03:21:28.169]  This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton.
[03:21:30.010 --> 03:21:32.492]  Now, the two faces of Hillary Clinton are coming out.
[03:21:32.512 --> 03:21:38.855]  In fact, through WikiLeaks, she says one thing, and- Oh, no.
[03:21:38.875 --> 03:21:41.076]  All right, let's see if we can get Congressman Collins back.
[03:21:41.156 --> 03:21:42.917]  Obviously, we just lost the satellite feed.
[03:21:45.892 --> 03:21:47.294]  I think the media is very dishonest.
[03:21:47.334 --> 03:21:48.175]  I say it all the time.
[03:21:48.355 --> 03:21:51.739]  I think they're among the most dishonest human beings I've ever met.
[03:22:07.108 --> 03:22:21.583]  Remember, Hillary Clinton has some vulnerabilities herself because of her support in the 1990s for anti-crime legislation that ultimately helped contribute to this era of mass incarceration that she now speaks out again.
[03:22:21.604 --> 03:22:24.106]  We just lost Brianna Keillor.
[03:22:34.291 --> 03:22:35.373]  I will be the nominee.
[03:22:35.413 --> 03:22:37.435]  There is no way that I won't be.
[03:22:38.376 --> 03:22:47.065]  Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections?
[03:22:47.605 --> 03:22:48.807]  Is that democracy?
[03:23:05.572 --> 03:23:07.373]  History is watching us now.
[03:23:08.133 --> 03:23:11.495]  It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion.
[03:23:11.835 --> 03:23:12.695]  Just win, baby.
[03:23:12.975 --> 03:23:19.899]  And if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.
[03:23:20.999 --> 03:23:21.780]  I am with you.
[03:23:23.100 --> 03:23:24.121]  I will fight for you.
[03:23:24.981 --> 03:23:26.742]  And I will win for you.
[03:23:29.663 --> 03:23:30.944]  I am your voice.
[03:23:40.416 --> 03:23:43.077]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[03:23:43.317 --> 03:23:46.378]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[03:23:46.719 --> 03:23:47.459]  Because it's already here.
[03:23:47.839 --> 03:23:48.519]  It's being announced.
[03:23:48.860 --> 03:23:52.321]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[03:23:52.761 --> 03:23:54.662]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:23:54.802 --> 03:23:56.343]  A new battleship in the fight.
[03:23:56.543 --> 03:23:57.523]  InfoWars Live.
[03:23:57.723 --> 03:23:58.564]  Available right now.
[03:23:58.824 --> 03:24:00.184]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[03:24:00.624 --> 03:24:03.025]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[03:24:03.706 --> 03:24:04.626]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[03:24:05.186 --> 03:24:08.187]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.

[03:24:34.554 --> 03:24:41.779]  Again, we're under constant attack, not only in the media, but also direct pack attack, as Alex has talked about on numerous occasions.
[03:24:42.340 --> 03:24:45.482]  They're now characterizing us as fake news.
[03:24:45.542 --> 03:24:48.465]  We actually have Facebook banning our links.
[03:24:49.045 --> 03:24:58.609]  To desperately try to prevent people from learning the truth, which is why we need your support at InfoWarsLife.com, where we have the Christmas Super Sale Special.

[03:25:44.280 --> 03:25:47.402]  You can read the independent five-star reviews at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:25:47.982 --> 03:25:54.546]  Again, these are really good products and really huge discounts, particularly Brain Force Plus.
[03:25:54.606 --> 03:25:56.487]  I've recommended that on numerous occasions.
[03:25:56.527 --> 03:25:57.267]  It works for me.
[03:25:57.608 --> 03:25:58.708]  I use it regularly.
[03:25:59.449 --> 03:26:02.951]  It helps you with cognitive thinking, helps you with cognitive skills.
[03:26:03.211 --> 03:26:04.632]  Also, socially, it helps you.
[03:26:04.672 --> 03:26:06.393]  Again, Brain Force Plus.
[03:26:06.473 --> 03:26:09.215]  Don't take too many of them because that is potent stuff.
[03:26:09.855 --> 03:26:21.607]  Read up on New Tropics, basically what all the whiz kids in Silicon Valley are taking, and it can really help you too, and it's available with a massive discount, as are all the other products at infowarslife.com.
[03:26:22.048 --> 03:26:27.734]  Free store-wide shipping, and you will get your products by Christmas if you order today!
[03:26:29.175 --> 03:26:33.359]  Now I'm going to talk about the Berlin truck attack, as CNN called it.
[03:26:33.439 --> 03:26:37.263]  Again, the truck just drove into a Christmas market of its own accord.
[03:26:37.283 --> 03:26:39.505]  There was no ideology behind it whatsoever.
[03:26:39.525 --> 03:26:43.349]  We're going to get into that in the next segment with our guest, who is on the ground in Germany.
[03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:49.735]  But with all that was going on yesterday, we were unable, or I was unable at least, to properly focus on
[03:26:50.748 --> 03:27:18.767]  The delicious outcome of the electoral voting, when for weeks and weeks you had this hysterical campaign by the likes of Michael Moore, by C-rate celebrities in Hollywood, remember they came out with that video immediately before, by Hillary Clinton supporters, who deluged Republican electors with thousands upon thousands of emails, letters, phone calls of course, many death threats along with it because they're tolerant liberals,
[03:27:19.955 --> 03:27:23.538]  All to try and make them change their mind and not vote for Donald Trump.
[03:27:23.878 --> 03:27:25.199]  Well, what happened yesterday?
[03:27:25.219 --> 03:27:26.160]  Okay?
[03:27:26.620 --> 03:27:31.484]  Two electors in Texas changed their mind and didn't vote for Donald Trump.
[03:27:31.804 --> 03:27:31.965]  Two.
[03:27:33.390 --> 03:27:36.972]  Five electors didn't vote for Hillary Clinton!
[03:27:37.013 --> 03:27:41.215]  That's right, five electors abandoned Hillary Clinton.
[03:27:41.896 --> 03:27:46.899]  And three more, this is what the media won't admit, three more tried to defect.
[03:27:47.340 --> 03:27:48.160]  They were replaced.
[03:27:48.480 --> 03:27:59.068]  So in total you had eight electors try to abandon Hillary Clinton and not vote for Hillary in the electoral vote, compared to just two for Donald Trump.
[03:28:00.214 --> 03:28:14.602]  After a week-long campaign of harassment, intimidation, death threats, celebrities coming out with their ridiculous YouTube videos trying to get Republicans to change their mind, as I predicted before this happened,
[03:28:15.703 --> 03:28:21.888]  All this harassment, all these letters only made Republican electors more determined to vote for Trump.
[03:28:22.549 --> 03:28:24.671]  It actually had the opposite effect.
[03:28:25.171 --> 03:28:27.814]  So much failed from the left.
[03:28:28.494 --> 03:28:29.735]  The recount failed.
[03:28:29.795 --> 03:28:30.956]  The riots failed.
[03:28:31.397 --> 03:28:32.938]  Threatening the electors failed.
[03:28:33.018 --> 03:28:34.439]  The fake news narrative failed.
[03:28:34.720 --> 03:28:35.841]  Russian hacking failed.
[03:28:36.341 --> 03:28:39.404]  They failed again and again and again.
[03:28:40.540 --> 03:28:41.801]  And they're going to continue to fail.
[03:28:42.342 --> 03:28:48.867]  So again, Hillary Clinton lost more electors than any politician in the last 100 years.
[03:28:49.808 --> 03:28:54.652]  Not since 1912 has a candidate lost more electors.
[03:28:55.033 --> 03:28:56.494]  Let that sink in.
[03:28:56.995 --> 03:28:58.616]  Again, absolutely delicious.
[03:28:59.297 --> 03:29:01.659]  But again, you've got Michael Moore coming out today and saying,
[03:29:02.964 --> 03:29:03.584]  We're not done.
[03:29:04.324 --> 03:29:06.685]  They're not bored of failing yet.
[03:29:06.725 --> 03:29:08.185]  They're going to continue to fail.
[03:29:08.565 --> 03:29:15.147]  They're going to try and pull off something, God knows what, between now and January 20th.
[03:29:15.367 --> 03:29:23.029]  Michael Moore tweeted last night, after the electoral vote, quote, he's not president for four and a half weeks, next idea.
[03:29:24.069 --> 03:29:25.710]  Well, here's an idea, Michael.
[03:29:26.130 --> 03:29:27.490]  Why don't you take a look in the mirror?
[03:29:27.950 --> 03:29:30.191]  Why don't you ask yourselves why you lost?
[03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:32.591]  You know, have a little bit of self-reflection.
[03:29:33.031 --> 03:29:37.234]  Why don't you stop trying to sabotage a democratic election?
[03:29:37.914 --> 03:29:39.355]  How's that for an idea?
[03:29:39.875 --> 03:29:40.416]  But no.
[03:29:41.136 --> 03:29:50.522]  They're so pleased with themselves for failing five times consecutively that they're going to continue to try to fail again and again.
[03:29:50.862 --> 03:29:53.864]  And Donald Trump is going to win again and again and again.
[03:29:54.184 --> 03:29:56.045]  We'll be back with our guest in the next segment.
[03:29:56.065 --> 03:29:57.146]  Stay tuned.
[03:29:59.338 --> 03:30:02.325]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.267 --> 03:30:05.953]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:19.648 --> 03:30:27.560]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[03:30:27.640 --> 03:30:30.724]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[03:30:31.550 --> 03:30:33.351]  And they're also very affordable.
[03:30:33.371 --> 03:30:33.711]  Exactly.
[03:30:33.731 --> 03:30:35.511]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[03:30:35.531 --> 03:30:38.872]  You talk about we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[03:30:38.912 --> 03:30:40.193]  We've both talked to them.
[03:30:40.373 --> 03:30:49.336]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[03:30:50.216 --> 03:30:51.297]  We refuse to screw people.
[03:30:51.657 --> 03:30:52.617]  We refuse to do that.
[03:30:52.997 --> 03:30:54.978]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[03:30:55.518 --> 03:31:02.261]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[03:31:02.662 --> 03:31:03.422]  It's a win-win.
[03:31:03.902 --> 03:31:09.565]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:31:09.785 --> 03:31:14.227]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[03:31:14.267 --> 03:31:25.193]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[03:31:25.373 --> 03:31:30.295]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[03:31:30.415 --> 03:31:32.916]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[03:31:32.996 --> 03:31:34.477]  It helps detoxify.
[03:31:34.697 --> 03:31:37.538]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[03:31:37.578 --> 03:31:42.340]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[03:31:42.360 --> 03:31:48.582]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[03:31:48.602 --> 03:31:53.944]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[03:31:54.045 --> 03:31:54.705]  I'm taking it now.
[03:31:55.725 --> 03:31:57.026]  If you look at Bill Clinton,
[03:32:12.732 --> 03:32:13.272]  Far worse.
[03:32:13.493 --> 03:32:15.173]  Minor words and his was action.
[03:32:15.754 --> 03:32:17.294]  His was what he's done to women.
[03:32:17.334 --> 03:32:22.997]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[03:32:23.217 --> 03:32:25.538]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[03:32:25.898 --> 03:32:30.821]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
[03:32:30.881 --> 03:32:32.081]  Four of them here tonight.
[03:32:32.201 --> 03:32:37.504]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[03:32:48.342 --> 03:32:51.084]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[03:32:51.945 --> 03:32:53.406]  It's a fight for our minds.
[03:32:54.067 --> 03:32:56.009]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.

[03:33:22.193 --> 03:33:22.914]  Big Brother.
[03:33:23.334 --> 03:33:24.555]  Mainstream media.
[03:33:25.116 --> 03:33:26.998]  Government cover-ups.
[03:33:27.018 --> 03:33:28.439]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:33:28.699 --> 03:33:29.840]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:30.381 --> 03:33:34.925]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:40.052 --> 03:33:45.714]  ISIS has claimed responsibility for the devastating terror attack in Berlin yesterday, of course.
[03:33:46.274 --> 03:33:52.957]  The horrible sight of a truck having been driven through a Christmas market, at least 12 people dead, dozens more injured.
[03:33:53.357 --> 03:33:57.478]  The suspect, as of this moment, is still on the run.
[03:33:58.099 --> 03:34:03.581]  They arrested a Pakistani refugee, then claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack.
[03:34:03.861 --> 03:34:07.202]  So an armed terrorist, still on the run, in Berlin,
[03:34:07.962 --> 03:34:18.689]  As we discuss, again, moving towards New Year's Eve, we know what happened in Cologne last year, the impact of the mass migrant policy that Angela Merkel has overseen in Germany.
[03:34:19.089 --> 03:34:25.753]  And to discuss that, we are talking to Annabelle Schonker, who is a model and journalist there in Germany.
[03:34:26.174 --> 03:34:27.394]  Annabelle, welcome to the show.
[03:34:27.414 --> 03:34:29.176]  Hi, Paul.
[03:34:30.116 --> 03:34:30.857]  How are you?
[03:34:31.894 --> 03:34:34.598]  Now, of course, you've been covering this, you're there on the ground.
[03:34:35.179 --> 03:34:39.925]  First, I just want to get your general reaction to what happened yesterday in Berlin.
[03:34:40.386 --> 03:34:45.873]  How did you find out about this horrible attack and what were your initial thoughts when you saw this happen?
[03:34:47.816 --> 03:34:52.599]  My first thought was just, this is a terrorist attack.
[03:34:52.719 --> 03:35:04.365]  To me, it was totally clear what happened in this moment because it remembers me of what happened in Nice, for example, and so it was really clear what happened.
[03:35:04.445 --> 03:35:06.546]  It was just a matter of time, I think.
[03:35:08.018 --> 03:35:14.160]  No, no, we had CNN speculating for what seemed like hours whether it was an accident.
[03:35:14.260 --> 03:35:18.441]  It seemed like they were hoping that it was obviously, as you said, identical to Nice.
[03:35:18.981 --> 03:35:21.262]  Now Islamic State has claimed responsibility.
[03:35:21.922 --> 03:35:31.065]  But of course this comes after Germany has imported 1.5 million mostly Muslim migrants over the past 18 months.
[03:35:32.125 --> 03:35:45.730]  Numerous migrants involved in the mass molestation in Cologne, rapes of German women, of course we had the migrant who tried to blow himself up outside a music festival earlier in the summer, several other incidents.
[03:35:46.151 --> 03:35:56.815]  They're saying that the migrant numbers coming into Germany have now dropped off, that there's only 300,000 migrants a year coming into Germany, like that's a small number.
[03:35:57.495 --> 03:35:58.536]  You live in Germany.
[03:35:58.877 --> 03:36:02.180]  You've experienced the impact that this migrant influx has had.
[03:36:02.641 --> 03:36:10.109]  In what ways has life for Germans changed since Angela Merkel opened the door to this migrant influx?
[03:36:11.513 --> 03:36:13.955]  Life in Germany has totally changed.
[03:36:14.215 --> 03:36:18.219]  I have to say, I talk a lot with other women.
[03:36:18.919 --> 03:36:22.743]  For example, they write me mails the whole day.
[03:36:23.163 --> 03:36:25.385]  They are scared of going out.
[03:36:25.845 --> 03:36:29.769]  They ask themselves what to wear when they go out.
[03:36:30.850 --> 03:36:35.774]  Especially the life of the women in Germany has totally changed.
[03:36:37.355 --> 03:36:38.938]  Terrorists are taken burden now.
[03:36:39.058 --> 03:36:42.965]  I think the life of all people will be changed.
[03:36:45.339 --> 03:36:51.500]  I mean, I visited Dresden back in the summer, and there was a migrant camp located nearby.
[03:36:51.860 --> 03:36:53.861]  And you could see that there was a group of migrants.
[03:36:53.921 --> 03:36:57.002]  Again, the locals were complaining about drug dealing.
[03:36:57.142 --> 03:36:59.342]  I saw them with my own eyes harassing women.
[03:36:59.762 --> 03:37:01.503]  So you've experienced that too, have you?
[03:37:01.523 --> 03:37:06.804]  I mean, I receive emails from German women basically every week complaining about their treatment.
[03:37:07.104 --> 03:37:12.365]  So you're saying you no longer feel safe walking the streets at night in Germany, correct?
[03:37:13.493 --> 03:37:15.194]  Yeah, this is correct.
[03:37:16.094 --> 03:37:28.698]  After Cologne, my first step was to buy me, I don't know the English word, I think pepper spray and kind of alarm for my bag.
[03:37:29.138 --> 03:37:36.121]  And yeah, this was the first step and I know many women who did the same.
[03:37:38.171 --> 03:37:39.091]  No, I mean, exactly.
[03:37:39.112 --> 03:37:43.614]  You've got sales of quote, non-lethal weapons in Germany flying off the shelves.
[03:37:43.674 --> 03:37:45.395]  They can't get the stock in quick enough.
[03:37:45.695 --> 03:37:51.058]  And that is because, as you said, you've got incidents like Cologne last year, also Hamburg as well.
[03:37:51.478 --> 03:37:57.801]  Meanwhile, you've got the mayor of Cologne saying, keep the rapist at arm's length.
[03:37:58.201 --> 03:38:00.803]  Like, that's anyway reasonable kind of advice to women.
[03:38:01.183 --> 03:38:04.685]  This year in Cologne, you have a huge police operation
[03:38:05.365 --> 03:38:06.966]  Again, at taxpayer expense.
[03:38:07.527 --> 03:38:19.275]  And according to what I read about this, the German police, the special officers in Cologne, are going to talk to the victims of sexual assaults after the attack!
[03:38:19.675 --> 03:38:20.436]  So they're not even...
[03:38:21.076 --> 03:38:22.618]  Going to try and prevent the attack.
[03:38:22.658 --> 03:38:24.840]  They acknowledge that they can't prevent the attacks.
[03:38:25.120 --> 03:38:28.123]  They're just going to console people afterwards.
[03:38:28.523 --> 03:38:35.610]  I mean, do you envisage more sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve in these other German cities?
[03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:37.652]  Do you think that's going to happen again this year?
[03:38:39.852 --> 03:38:40.432]  I don't know.
[03:38:40.452 --> 03:38:52.396]  I think in Cologne it's not going to happen because I think it will be the safest place in Germany on this New Year's Eve.
[03:38:52.576 --> 03:39:01.838]  So I don't think this would happen again in Cologne, but I'm sure it will happen in other towns, maybe smaller towns.
[03:39:01.958 --> 03:39:03.999]  Yeah, that would be so.
[03:39:05.393 --> 03:39:09.414]  And of course we know there was a huge cover up in the media in the first few days of that.
[03:39:09.474 --> 03:39:10.894]  They refused to report on it.
[03:39:11.315 --> 03:39:12.815]  But we have Angela Merkel.
[03:39:12.855 --> 03:39:16.496]  Now this is what confuses me whenever I read about Angela Merkel.
[03:39:16.796 --> 03:39:19.697]  Because we see all these horrible stories coming out of Germany.
[03:39:20.117 --> 03:39:28.119]  And yet according to the latest polls, Angela Merkel still has the support of the majority of the German people.
[03:39:28.659 --> 03:39:34.023]  So it was 56% supported her in the next election.
[03:39:34.083 --> 03:39:38.786]  She still maintains strong support from the German people despite all this.
[03:39:39.066 --> 03:39:45.570]  So why, after everything that's happened Annabelle, is Angela Merkel still popular in Germany?
[03:39:47.059 --> 03:39:48.841]  That's a really good question.
[03:39:48.861 --> 03:39:51.705]  I don't know the exact answer.
[03:39:51.825 --> 03:39:55.410]  I'm asking myself this question all the time.
[03:39:56.171 --> 03:40:00.056]  This country is just crazy, I think.
[03:40:00.216 --> 03:40:01.698]  It's a lot about
[03:40:02.659 --> 03:40:20.155]  Yeah, the people have high moral standards and they talk about humanism and about that we are guilty in a way and have to give something back to the people and this is the mood.
[03:40:21.777 --> 03:40:34.194]  Which inspires these people to help the refugees no matter what and to support Angela Merkel.
[03:40:36.352 --> 03:40:44.416]  I mean, that's something that we often can't grasp in different countries, is how deeply ingrained is that kind of World War II Hitler guilt?
[03:40:44.776 --> 03:40:53.921]  I mean, of course, because that's what's driving a lot of people, but it's driving younger people still to adopt these suicidal leftist worldviews in Germany.
[03:40:54.321 --> 03:40:59.588]  So, is that kind of collective guilt ingrained into the German people at a young age?
[03:40:59.609 --> 03:41:05.396]  Is it, you know, at the educational, at the school level, that they have to be guilty about Hitler and World War II?
[03:41:05.457 --> 03:41:07.099]  Is that actually in the schooling?
[03:41:08.200 --> 03:41:08.821]  Yeah, this is...
[03:41:10.586 --> 03:41:21.331]  Indeed, in the schooling it's about education and I think it's also, it's not only the World War II, it's yeah,
[03:41:26.644 --> 03:41:35.488]  New topics like the Third World and what we have done to the Third World and things like that.
[03:41:36.709 --> 03:41:40.011]  It's a mixture of both things.
[03:41:40.491 --> 03:41:52.077]  The World War II and these Third World things and war in Syria and Iraq and Afghanistan and all this stuff together.
[03:41:53.547 --> 03:41:55.428]  And I mean, it's so bad at this point.
[03:41:55.448 --> 03:42:00.572]  There's quite a famous video, which I put up on Twitter earlier today, of Angela Merkel.
[03:42:00.612 --> 03:42:01.733]  She's at a public event.
[03:42:02.514 --> 03:42:07.057]  One of her other, I think it's one of her ministers, hands her a German flag.
[03:42:07.558 --> 03:42:10.460]  And she kind of shakes her head and says, no, no, no, no.
[03:42:10.860 --> 03:42:12.982]  And then hands the German flag to somebody else.
[03:42:13.382 --> 03:42:20.147]  She didn't even want to be seen on stage with a German flag, the flag of her own country.
[03:42:20.488 --> 03:42:21.648]  There's also a video of, you know,
[03:42:22.409 --> 03:42:24.311]  People go on marches, on protests.
[03:42:24.912 --> 03:42:26.193]  They wave the German flag.
[03:42:26.233 --> 03:42:29.136]  The police say, you can't wave the German flag.
[03:42:29.196 --> 03:42:30.617]  It might offend somebody.
[03:42:30.737 --> 03:42:32.039]  It might stir up trouble.
[03:42:32.479 --> 03:42:44.131]  So how bad is a situation in Germany where your own flag is now seen as offensive and can't even be shown in public and your own Chancellor is ashamed of her own flag?
[03:42:45.691 --> 03:42:48.312]  This is so typical German.
[03:42:49.412 --> 03:42:59.755]  The people have such a problem with patriotism and to be proud of their own country.
[03:42:59.775 --> 03:43:07.737]  This is a big problem in Germany and it's also a big problem in case of integration
[03:43:08.397 --> 03:43:18.286]  of refugees and migrants because of the fact we are ashamed of our own identity, of our own country.
[03:43:18.886 --> 03:43:33.139]  And yeah, this is not very attractive for migrants to identify with people of a country who are ashamed of their own national identity.
[03:43:34.685 --> 03:43:39.289]  Exactly, and you saw the video there we just played of Merkel ashamed of her own flag.
[03:43:39.309 --> 03:43:43.472]  You also have something else that I've noticed, and I included this in my recent video.
[03:43:43.892 --> 03:43:55.001]  You have government commercials on television in Germany where it's a blonde German woman saying how wonderful hijabs are and that Germans need to embrace multiculturalism.
[03:43:55.341 --> 03:43:57.003]  You have Christmas markets.
[03:43:57.483 --> 03:44:04.325]  Much like the one that was just attacked by an Islamic terrorist, where they have Christmas songs Islamified.
[03:44:04.645 --> 03:44:10.007]  They take original Christian songs, Islamify them, make Muslim migrants sing them.
[03:44:10.267 --> 03:44:12.648]  They broadcast this live on television.
[03:44:12.668 --> 03:44:18.070]  I mean, you talked about the schooling, the education, in terms of culture, in terms of television.
[03:44:18.570 --> 03:44:30.624]  Do you see this in the culture where they're forcing, indoctrinating people to kind of accept this idea that they have to integrate with the migrants, not that the migrants have to integrate into Germany?
[03:44:30.684 --> 03:44:32.106]  Have you seen that in the culture?
[03:44:33.448 --> 03:44:38.409]  Yeah, it's all about cultural relativism in Germany.
[03:44:38.769 --> 03:44:57.813]  You have this in school, you have this at university, it's the whole, yeah, it's the topic, yeah, overall, yeah, cultural relativism and you have to tolerate the culture, the culture of the migrants,
[03:44:59.133 --> 03:45:04.735]  Yeah, people who wear a hijab and stuff like that.
[03:45:05.135 --> 03:45:11.438]  But the problem is they don't tolerate our culture.
[03:45:11.718 --> 03:45:20.681]  And yeah, this is the problem because we are not proud enough to protect our own identity.
[03:45:22.253 --> 03:45:23.294]  I mean, that's when it's a problem.
[03:45:23.314 --> 03:45:35.340]  When you're asked to tolerate a culture which at its very root is barbaric, is regressive, is itself intolerant, in a supposedly liberal tolerant society, you're being asked to tolerate that.
[03:45:35.660 --> 03:45:36.861]  Makes absolutely no sense.
[03:45:37.421 --> 03:45:54.189]  The other thing that shocked me about Germany, of course, you had the head of the Green Party, Stephanie von Berg, come out last year and she celebrated the fact that Germans, native Germans, will be a minority in their own cities within 30 years.
[03:45:54.409 --> 03:46:01.412]  She got up in front of the Parliament and celebrated that fact because it would prove right-wingers wrong.
[03:46:01.932 --> 03:46:08.699]  So they're talking about the demographic suicide of the German people, just to prove a point!
[03:46:09.280 --> 03:46:13.584]  I mean, Annabelle, do you think that they're doing that just for political power?
[03:46:13.945 --> 03:46:17.709]  So they can have all these migrants come in and vote for left-wing parties?
[03:46:18.089 --> 03:46:22.334]  Or is there something more to that demographic suicide of the German people?
[03:46:23.723 --> 03:46:38.632]  It's definitely something more because members of the Green Party or a lot of members of the Green Party in Germany are something that we call anti-Deutsche, anti-Germans.
[03:46:39.893 --> 03:46:51.740]  This is some kind of ideology of people who really hate Germany and the German identity and who are
[03:46:52.637 --> 03:47:00.104]  Quite happy, yeah, if we delete ourselves from the world.
[03:47:01.670 --> 03:47:02.310]  It's amazing.
[03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:09.232]  Now, on top of this, we've got Facebook, Twitter, other social media websites, not only censoring people.
[03:47:09.272 --> 03:47:19.575]  In fact, the German government demanded that Facebook delete certain content within 24 hours or they would fine the company, they would fine Facebook.
[03:47:20.355 --> 03:47:24.577]  You were censored on Facebook recently in relation to this migrant crisis.
[03:47:24.977 --> 03:47:25.877]  Tell us what happened.
[03:47:27.790 --> 03:47:48.196]  I was blocked from Facebook for about 30 days because of posting a mail I got from a migrant person who offended me in a real bad way.
[03:47:49.937 --> 03:47:53.198]  He said to me, I really need the
[03:47:54.918 --> 03:48:05.648]  Poom, poom, poom, cock in me and yeah, I posted this mail and got blocked from Facebook for 30 days.
[03:48:05.788 --> 03:48:10.652]  But basically you were sexually harassed, at least on message, by one of these migrants.
[03:48:10.712 --> 03:48:13.354]  That is harassment according to Facebook's own policies.
[03:48:13.715 --> 03:48:20.581]  You posted that image on Facebook and said, look, I'm being harassed by this individual and he wasn't banned, you were banned.
[03:48:21.321 --> 03:48:23.983]  That gives you an insight into how Facebook is treating this.
[03:48:24.424 --> 03:48:33.070]  Now as we know that the Stasi is involved, former Stasi official, involved with censorship with Facebook and with the German government.
[03:48:33.550 --> 03:48:34.831]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:48:35.312 --> 03:48:41.596]  And now Germans are getting home visits from the police if they criticize the migrant policy in their own country.
[03:48:41.656 --> 03:48:42.757]  It's absolutely frightening.
[03:48:43.237 --> 03:48:44.698]  Where do you see this going Annabelle?
[03:48:44.718 --> 03:48:46.240]  Do you think Merkel will be forced
[03:48:46.880 --> 03:48:48.182]  To change her policy?
[03:48:48.362 --> 03:48:51.806]  Will she be elected in the election next year?
[03:48:51.826 --> 03:48:53.769]  Is it the end for Angela Merkel?
[03:48:54.049 --> 03:48:55.852]  Or do you think this will continue to get worse?
[03:48:57.208 --> 03:48:59.329]  It's not the end of Angela Merkel.
[03:49:00.109 --> 03:49:14.896]  As you said, as you already said, the Germans still vote for Angela Merkel and I'm pretty sure that they will vote for her in the next elections in 2017.
[03:49:15.256 --> 03:49:24.660]  So nothing will change and this is the big problem for all the people here who criticize Angela Merkel's policy.
[03:49:26.109 --> 03:49:27.070]  It's absolutely amazing.
[03:49:27.110 --> 03:49:35.597]  I mean, I thought Sweden would be the first European country to really have its back broken, but Germany is certainly providing stiff competition.
[03:49:35.977 --> 03:49:42.143]  Just here in the final minute, Annabelle, tell people where they can find you on Twitter and how they can read your articles.
[03:49:43.666 --> 03:49:49.570]  They can read my articles on Tillis Einblick and also on Huffington Post.
[03:49:49.850 --> 03:49:56.895]  The English translations are coming up on my website anabelschonkel.com.
[03:49:57.356 --> 03:50:04.561]  You can find me also on Twitter at Annie Rockstar and on Facebook anabelschonkel.
[03:50:05.836 --> 03:50:09.858]  Okay, and I'll be sure to link to those pages when this interview goes up on YouTube.
[03:50:10.439 --> 03:50:15.482]  Journalist for The Huffington Post and other outlets, Annabelle Schunker, thanks for joining us today.
[03:50:15.502 --> 03:50:17.043]  Yeah, thanks, Paul.
[03:50:17.983 --> 03:50:18.884]  Thank you, take care.
[03:50:19.344 --> 03:50:27.329]  There goes Annabelle Schunker from Germany, and again, ISIS is now playing responsibility for yesterday's attack in Berlin.
[03:50:28.604 --> 03:50:33.089]  Of course, now they're building barriers around every single Christmas market in Berlin.
[03:50:33.509 --> 03:50:35.912]  Not building barriers around their own border.
[03:50:36.212 --> 03:50:39.896]  In fact, not even enforcing their own border laws.
[03:50:39.916 --> 03:50:43.239]  300,000 migrants still coming in.
[03:50:43.780 --> 03:50:49.566]  At first they were saying, yes, it's been 1.5 million migrants over the past 18 months, but it's dropping off.
[03:50:50.086 --> 03:50:51.547]  We're scaling back the policy.
[03:50:52.068 --> 03:50:55.670]  Only gonna be 300,000 every single year now.
[03:50:56.231 --> 03:50:59.093]  And that is the total immigration into the UK every year.
[03:50:59.373 --> 03:51:02.616]  Germany is doing it just on that one level alone.
[03:51:02.996 --> 03:51:05.618]  We'll be back with the final segment of the Alex Jones Show after the break.
[03:51:05.638 --> 03:51:06.159]  Don't go away.
[03:51:15.396 --> 03:51:17.197]  People keep asking, is Trump for real?
[03:51:17.237 --> 03:51:18.978]  That's kind of a sorrow's talking point.
[03:51:19.498 --> 03:51:22.740]  I'm not pooh-poohing asking if he's for real, but what is your take on that?
[03:51:24.681 --> 03:51:27.302]  Well, I mean, there's an overreaction on both sides, Alex.
[03:51:27.643 --> 03:51:29.323]  You look at the Mitt Romney situation.
[03:51:29.964 --> 03:51:37.168]  You know, if he selects Mitt Romney for his Secretary of State, the whole narrative has been about, oh, but what about the insults during the campaign?
[03:51:37.208 --> 03:51:39.909]  How can we possibly forgive Mitt Romney for his insults?
[03:51:39.949 --> 03:51:41.210]  It's not about his insults.
[03:51:41.630 --> 03:51:43.912]  It's about the fact that he wanted to arm jihadists.
[03:51:43.973 --> 03:51:45.854]  It's about the fact that he wants war with Russia.
[03:51:46.335 --> 03:51:53.402]  But again, you can't just immediately dispense with a year and a half of hard work because he makes one decision that you don't like.
[03:51:54.003 --> 03:51:59.649]  And you know, leftists are all over the place saying that Trump's surrounding himself with people who believe the same thing as him.
[03:52:00.249 --> 03:52:00.990]  Well, he's not, is he?
[03:52:01.010 --> 03:52:05.093]  If he's picking Mitt Romney, then that is definitely diversity of opinion.
[03:52:05.553 --> 03:52:18.102]  So likewise, just because he does something positive with the wall or any other issue, TPP, we're not immediately going to bow down and worship him and unquestionably, you know, just follow him without thinking about any of his actions.
[03:52:18.122 --> 03:52:20.624]  So on either side of the equation, whatever he does,
[03:52:21.084 --> 03:52:24.988]  He can't dispense with it immediately because that's a massive overreaction.
[03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:28.131]  Unfortunately, you know, that's how a lot of people think.
[03:52:28.552 --> 03:52:35.880]  If you look at his contract with Americans, all of that he says can be established, can be accomplished within the first 100 days.
[03:52:35.920 --> 03:52:37.241]  Well, give him the chance to do it.
[03:52:37.601 --> 03:52:43.768]  You've got Obama on the flip side saying that he's going to sign a slew of executive orders over the next
[03:52:44.288 --> 03:52:46.409]  Six weeks or so before he's out of office.
[03:52:46.809 --> 03:52:51.271]  So a lot of Trump's time initially will be caught up in rewinding, undoing all that.
[03:52:51.631 --> 03:52:55.993]  But you can't just overreact on one thing that you don't like that he's done so far.
[03:52:56.333 --> 03:53:01.995]  They're like saying, you know, he better rewind everything or, oh, he's transitions in chaos.
[03:53:02.015 --> 03:53:06.897]  He won't sign documents Obama's sending over that we've now learned are documents never been sent before.
[03:53:07.277 --> 03:53:12.359]  They're trying to get Trump to sign contracts as a president to bind himself before it ever happens.
[03:53:12.839 --> 03:53:17.963]  Paralleling that, you've got this huge recount effort, which has basically got no chance of succeeding.
[03:53:18.023 --> 03:53:19.765]  It's not going to overturn the election results.
[03:53:20.045 --> 03:53:24.048]  But again, they're trying to put a roadblock between Trump and the inauguration.
[03:53:24.248 --> 03:53:26.410]  You know, January 1920, whatever day it is.
[03:53:26.850 --> 03:53:30.914]  They're trying to delegitimize his legacy before it even begins.
[03:53:31.454 --> 03:53:34.256]  And it's completely failing as we predicted it would.
[03:53:35.096 --> 03:53:41.359]  Jill Stein basically didn't adhere to the law in Wisconsin, which said you need to have proof of fraud.
[03:53:41.739 --> 03:53:43.520]  It wasn't just, oh, you have to pay this bill.
[03:53:43.560 --> 03:53:45.241]  It's you need to have proof of fraud.
[03:53:45.721 --> 03:53:48.543]  Well, they completely let her override that.
[03:53:48.883 --> 03:53:51.845]  There's going to be a recount there whether it takes place in time or not.
[03:53:51.865 --> 03:53:52.345]  We don't know.
[03:53:52.965 --> 03:53:58.128]  But they're charging her three times the amount they initially suggested was required.
[03:53:58.168 --> 03:54:00.249]  So now she's asking for even more money.
[03:54:00.569 --> 03:54:04.876]  With 52 days till his inauguration, what else will he try to pull?
[03:54:24.398 --> 03:54:28.942]  We'll be live for the final segment of the Alex Jones Show before we get back into some final news items.
[03:54:28.962 --> 03:54:33.506]  I want to tell you about, again, the Christmas specials at infowarslife.com.

[03:54:52.097 --> 03:54:56.259]  It helps you work if you're doing tasks, if you're doing writing, if you're speaking.
[03:54:56.299 --> 03:54:57.940]  It helps you in social situations.
[03:54:58.621 --> 03:55:01.983]  You get 20% more capsules per bottle with this deal.
[03:55:02.443 --> 03:55:05.665]  A brand new supercharger ingredient, black pepper extract.
[03:55:06.025 --> 03:55:07.626]  A higher concentration of key ingredients.
[03:55:07.947 --> 03:55:11.149]  And it's the same low price as the original Brain Force.

[03:55:35.452 --> 03:55:39.334]  Independent five-star reviews available at InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:55:47.379 --> 03:55:56.945]  Instead of buying tat that people don't want, people don't need, instead of supporting corporations that don't even support the American way, don't even support Donald Trump, don't even support
[03:55:57.785 --> 03:55:59.527]  Basic values and decency.
[03:56:00.327 --> 03:56:09.415]  Get our products and support our network so we can take on the mainstream media as it desperately, ceaselessly attacks us on a daily basis.
[03:56:10.436 --> 03:56:11.657]  Infowarslife.com
[03:56:13.342 --> 03:56:19.707]  The Daily Express reports, nativity scene removed over fears it will offend towns for Muslims.
[03:56:20.928 --> 03:56:22.008]  This is in Belgium.
[03:56:22.529 --> 03:56:28.373]  If this came out of Molenbeek in Belgium, which is an Islamic ghetto, maybe it would make more sense.
[03:56:28.453 --> 03:56:39.822]  But this is a town in Belgium which has a population of just four Muslims and town chiefs allegedly refused to include a traditional festive display in Halsbeek, Belgium.
[03:56:40.422 --> 03:56:43.845]  Over fears it could upset a member of the minuscule Muslim population.
[03:56:44.606 --> 03:56:45.947]  So it was a Christmas tree.
[03:56:46.647 --> 03:56:47.348]  God forbid.
[03:56:47.608 --> 03:56:48.669]  Can't say Merry Christmas.
[03:56:48.689 --> 03:56:50.471]  You can't even say Happy Holidays anymore.
[03:56:51.051 --> 03:56:58.317]  A university, Texas Women's University, banned saying Happy Holidays because even that wasn't politically correct enough.
[03:56:58.818 --> 03:57:04.382]  But this was a Christmas tree and a model of baby Jesus in a manger in the centre of town.
[03:57:05.103 --> 03:57:15.319]  And because some local politicians thought that it might offend the four Muslims who live there, quote, too provocative for them, they decided to remove it.
[03:57:16.561 --> 03:57:19.105]  In many cases you find that these Muslims, they don't even care.
[03:57:20.322 --> 03:57:23.323]  Politicians getting offended on behalf of other people.
[03:57:23.963 --> 03:57:30.906]  In fact, they had a shop in Islington, London, not far from me, which was called Very British.
[03:57:31.686 --> 03:57:36.248]  And they sold all these nice little items made in Britain, you know, with the Union Jack flag.
[03:57:37.068 --> 03:57:38.549]  The locals didn't like it.
[03:57:39.502 --> 03:57:45.307]  They wanted it shut down because it was racist to call a shop British and sell things made in Britain.
[03:57:45.767 --> 03:57:53.093]  Meanwhile, in the same area of London, you have Romanian shops that say Romanian shop on the front.
[03:57:53.394 --> 03:57:55.055]  You have Polish shops.
[03:57:55.475 --> 03:57:56.977]  You have Islamic shops.
[03:57:57.497 --> 03:58:02.481]  You've literally got Islamic bookstores, halal butchers every three shops down the road.
[03:58:03.422 --> 03:58:11.312]  But God forbid, if you try to have a British shop in Britain, that's racist and you will be shut down.
[03:58:11.792 --> 03:58:17.019]  Just to exemplify some of the political correctness that we're dealing with right now in this country.
[03:58:17.599 --> 03:58:20.963]  German ministers turn on Angela Merkel amid call for martial law after Berlin.
[03:58:21.664 --> 03:58:39.389]  At last, some ministers, some of her, quote, allies are coming forward and saying, surely after 1.5 million migrants, after Cologne, Hamburg, numerous sexual assaults, rapes, murders, surely it's time to take a look at this disastrous red carpet migrant policy.
[03:58:40.269 --> 03:58:42.930]  That's going to wrap it up for the show, InfoWars Nightly News coming up.
[03:58:43.050 --> 03:58:44.930]  Alex will be back with the main show tomorrow.
[03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:47.931]  Thanks for tuning in, breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:50.464 --> 03:58:52.311]  You are listening to GCN.

[03:59:00.638 --> 03:59:05.541]  Facebook, Twitter, and Google have now been sued by families of the victims of the Orlando nightclub shootings.
[03:59:05.781 --> 03:59:11.864]  The families of three victims are teaming up and suing the platforms for allegedly providing material support to the Islamic State.
[03:59:12.084 --> 03:59:25.631]  We have been reporting on ISIS or radical Islam's use of these social network platforms to recruit and spread its propaganda, mostly in the light of the hypocritical sense that you can be centered on Facebook or Twitter for being a conservative, sharing InfoWars links, speaking
