[00:00:01.238 --> 00:00:05.401]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:14.586]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:14.826 --> 00:00:18.148]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:37.063]  It is Sunday, my friends, the 10th day of January, 2016, as we accelerate into the future.
[00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:39.224]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:44.706]  We have a huge, jam-packed Sunday live transmission today.
[00:00:46.698 --> 00:00:47.878]  It is incredible.
[00:00:48.058 --> 00:00:53.360]  The sex attacks by the radical Muslims in Germany, blowing wide open, exposing government cover-ups.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.742]  Catalan, one of the most beautiful areas of Spain, seceding in a peaceful way.
[00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:01.523]  We've got that coming up.
[00:01:01.563 --> 00:01:08.305]  We've got Donald Trump in major polls nationwide, turbocharging with big leads on Hillary Clinton.
[00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:13.008]  It's Trump's to win, Trump's to lose right now.
[00:01:13.548 --> 00:01:20.292]  We've got huge news on the situation with the unraveling economy and more today.
[00:01:20.672 --> 00:01:25.215]  And the big move to go for the impeachment of Obama for his lawlessness.
[00:01:25.455 --> 00:01:26.156]  Here's the report.
[00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:33.840]  Regarding executive orders, the Constitution states in Article 2, Section 3, Clause 5, that the executive, i.e.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.684]  the President, take care that the laws be faithfully executed, or face impeachment.
[00:01:39.964 --> 00:01:44.007]  Specifically, an executive order must find support in the Constitution.
[00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:54.373]  Watering down the Second Amendment in order to confiscate the lawful right of a majority of Americans to protect themselves can hardly mean the laws are being faithfully executed.
[00:01:55.093 --> 00:02:00.177]  The conversation has to be based on facts and truth and what we're actually proposing.
[00:02:00.577 --> 00:02:06.902]  A big miss for Obama as he failed to explain to all of us what is contained in his latest executive order.
[00:02:07.122 --> 00:02:17.089]  Allowing HIPAA to protect doctors that order gun confiscation of their patients based on vague conditions is what's really sending alarm bells ringing.
[00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.051]  As if the health care system wasn't screwed up enough
[00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:22.073]  Unconstitutionally by Obama.
[00:02:22.454 --> 00:02:37.050]  We heard not only from the gun lobby, but from United States Senators, that expanding background checks will, not may, will lead to a registry, which will lead to confiscation, which will lead to a tyrannical government.
[00:02:37.338 --> 00:02:50.816]  Let's not forget that Gabrielle Giffords thankfully survived the 2011 Tucson shooting by the possibly MK Ultra victimized Jared Lee Loeffner, who erratically declared to the police while victims were still being treated,
[00:02:52.578 --> 00:02:53.319]  I'm sorry, Cooper.
[00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:54.460]  Yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.681]  What are you saying?
[00:03:13.757 --> 00:03:24.191]  Are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns away so that we can impose martial law?
[00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:28.397]  While you've been president, we are at the lowest murder rate in our country.
[00:03:28.797 --> 00:03:29.698]  I grew up in Kentucky.
[00:03:30.058 --> 00:03:31.599]  Trust me, those guns aren't just for hunting.
[00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:34.962]  And secondly, Obama, you don't know a damn thing about Kentucky.
[00:03:48.612 --> 00:03:52.355]  Well, I've got bad news for all of you that scoff at the word impeachment.
[00:03:52.696 --> 00:04:00.783]  Once Obama leaves office, he will have set the table for global government to legally come in and feast on the American public.
[00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:04.006]  Obama trade, with its laws that bypass the U.S.
[00:04:04.046 --> 00:04:06.968]  Congress for the benefit of the banking corporate elite.
[00:04:07.308 --> 00:04:14.595]  Obamacare, a middle class destroying Stasi-esque data collection system masquerading as a healthcare system.
[00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:19.017]  Obamagration, flooding our cities with criminals and jihadists.
[00:04:19.418 --> 00:04:30.664]  And now Obamafiscation, a solitary push to reduce the threat posed by armed Americans as the final dish by the New World Order's puppet is presented to the table.
[00:04:30.864 --> 00:04:41.210]  By not impeaching Obama, our nationalist apathy will legally and necessarily aid and abet the death of the United States of America.
[00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.490]  The time is now.
[00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:47.813]  Call your representative at 202-224-3121.
[00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:49.954]  Operators are standing by.
[00:04:50.314 --> 00:04:59.999]  And if your representative needs more information, direct them to the NorthAmericanLawCenter.org's Articles of Impeachment of Barack Hussein Obama at the very top of their webpage.
[00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.440]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.381]  We'll be back after the 60 second break.
[00:05:05.542 --> 00:05:07.482]  We're fighting for the Republican human liberty.
[00:05:07.843 --> 00:05:08.203]  Are you?
[00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.655]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[00:05:16.715 --> 00:05:19.437]  We've always offered five months free.
[00:05:19.617 --> 00:05:25.201]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:28.684]  PrisonPlanet.TV began 15 years ago.
[00:05:28.964 --> 00:05:31.946]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:34.368]  All of my documentary films, scores
[00:05:34.428 --> 00:05:35.428]  We're good to go.
[00:05:52.193 --> 00:05:59.618]  You can also sign up for a trial month and only pay $5.95, and then 20 of you and your friends and family can watch PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:01.920]  Get 20 memberships at half price.
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.761]  Be the Paul Revere in your community.
[00:06:03.941 --> 00:06:08.264]  That's 6 months free when you sign up for a year at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:13.508 --> 00:06:21.193]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:41.118 --> 00:06:52.623]  Ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting worldwide on this January 10th 2016 Sunday live broadcast as we do every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:53.084 --> 00:06:54.604]  Central Standard Time.
[00:06:54.624 --> 00:06:56.926]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:59.027 --> 00:07:00.827]  You do not want to miss the next two hours.
[00:07:01.608 --> 00:07:03.889]  Obviously it is just incredible.
[00:07:04.935 --> 00:07:15.578]  The information, the news we've got, top polling firms, top political strategists have hit the panic button in the Republican and Democratic parties right now.
[00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:20.480]  Donald J. Trump, in three national polls,
[00:07:21.514 --> 00:07:23.855]  is defeating Hillary Clinton handsomely.
[00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:49.822]  In mass, Democrats polled are reporting that upwards of 20% of them will cross over and vote for Donald Trump, ensuring him a landslide Reagan-esque victory in 2016, if they don't assassinate him, if they don't develop a fake scandal that brings him down, and if we have a fair and just election in this country.
[00:07:51.035 --> 00:07:56.860]  But I've interviewed Bev Harris and every other major top expert on electronic voting fraud.
[00:07:57.821 --> 00:08:03.307]  And it's very hard for the system to beat landslides.
[00:08:04.007 --> 00:08:09.953]  Because there's different districts, different people running the machines, don't engage in fraud.
[00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:13.596]  Some do, some Republicans cheat, some Democrats cheat.
[00:08:13.876 --> 00:08:15.098]  It's all cobbled together.
[00:08:15.851 --> 00:08:22.717]  And then voter news services run by the AP will supposedly collate all that to announce the winner, but it was a landslide.
[00:08:22.737 --> 00:08:32.565]  They have trouble cheating because it's so obvious they can't get away with it because the counties, the different districts, the different voting blocks are publishing their numbers.
[00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:37.069]  So they say if you're going to steal, steal big.
[00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:41.252]  That is true in history, but not in elections.
[00:08:41.712 --> 00:08:44.475]  You cannot steal big and get away with it.
[00:08:45.834 --> 00:08:49.838]  Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time, I believe Donald Trump may be the next president of the United States.
[00:08:50.338 --> 00:09:01.308]  That is a whole other can of worms because he's going to become president right as we collapse into a global depression that every major expert we talk to says is imminent, already happening in most areas of the world.
[00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.373]  The president isn't a magician.
[00:09:08.424 --> 00:09:09.405]  That's what Ron Paul said.
[00:09:09.425 --> 00:09:11.966]  If I get elected under the Constitution, I can't fix everything.
[00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:13.327]  A lot of this is systemic.
[00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:17.749]  So, I gotta tell you, I've privately talked to a lot of people that are smart.
[00:09:18.089 --> 00:09:18.729]  I agree with them.
[00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.131]  Infowars would be more successful if Hillary Clinton got elected.
[00:09:22.592 --> 00:09:25.733]  More people would wake up, more folks would get upset in the hell that's coming.
[00:09:26.374 --> 00:09:28.855]  But she might stage false flags bringing pure martial law.
[00:09:29.952 --> 00:09:33.255]  I don't think about things like, how will I be more successful on air?
[00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:39.520]  Because a lot of Republicans say, hey, let's get Hillary in, so what, we'll take over the House and Senate, she'll be a lame duck, we'll impeach her.
[00:09:40.802 --> 00:09:43.024]  The Republican leadership likes to work with her too much.
[00:09:44.316 --> 00:09:46.317]  And I don't think of things in a Machiavellian way.
[00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:48.878]  I mean, I can do it better than the best.
[00:09:49.458 --> 00:09:56.020]  That's what we do is brainstorm the enemy operations and then reverse engineer them and expose them before they launch their next attack.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.501]  But we do it to stop them not to be Machiavelli.
[00:09:59.921 --> 00:10:01.902]  We want to build better things.
[00:10:02.242 --> 00:10:04.262]  We want life extension technology.
[00:10:04.483 --> 00:10:05.943]  We want clean technology.
[00:10:06.143 --> 00:10:07.584]  We want space platforms.
[00:10:07.784 --> 00:10:09.164]  We want space colonies.
[00:10:09.364 --> 00:10:11.785]  We want handshake deals for humanity.
[00:10:13.137 --> 00:10:18.419]  Based on innovation, exploration, not conquest.
[00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:26.202]  We don't want strong men, drug lord, warlords running our country like Mexico or Somalia.
[00:10:27.262 --> 00:10:31.083]  We want to innovate with the renaissance.
[00:10:31.644 --> 00:10:33.624]  We want our grandkids to be immortal.
[00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:34.925]  And that's within grasp.
[00:10:36.027 --> 00:10:36.347]  It is.
[00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:37.148]  Very close.
[00:10:37.648 --> 00:10:39.710]  We want to be fans of humanity.
[00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.393]  We want to really enjoy God's promises.
[00:10:44.294 --> 00:10:44.934]  We want to win.
[00:10:47.536 --> 00:10:52.780]  And screwing people over and brainwashing them and dumbing them down is not what an elite does.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.242]  If you're so elite, just turn humanity loose.
[00:10:55.903 --> 00:10:56.844]  If you're so incredible,
[00:10:57.947 --> 00:10:58.748]  What are you worried about?
[00:10:58.768 --> 00:11:00.489]  Why are you putting fluoride in the water?
[00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:01.269]  Why are you dumbing them down?
[00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.011]  Why are you teaching them 2 plus 2 equals 5?
[00:11:03.071 --> 00:11:06.913]  Why are you giving them vaccines on record to lower cognitive ability?
[00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:10.296]  If you're so powerful, why run?
[00:11:12.017 --> 00:11:13.318]  As Yoda told Palpatine.
[00:11:14.839 --> 00:11:16.840]  And this is the big epic battle going on.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.762]  All the rest of this news is window dressing.
[00:11:19.222 --> 00:11:20.303]  But Donald Trump
[00:11:23.493 --> 00:11:33.016]  Donald Trump, in three national polls, and in other major analyses, is turbo-charging right now.
[00:11:35.237 --> 00:11:36.557]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:11:36.617 --> 00:11:41.819]  Economists, GOP may win 47 states in general election, the biggest sweep ever.
[00:11:43.499 --> 00:11:46.140]  That's the Hill newspaper, not some Trump platform.
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.100]  The U.S.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.481]  News & World Report, Trump could win it all.
[00:11:51.881 --> 00:12:10.912]  Shot poll 20% of likely Democratic voters to cross over vote Trump Poll Trump beats Hillary in general election matchup Sylvester Stallone comes out and says quote I Love Donald Trump.
[00:12:13.653 --> 00:12:14.674]  I Love creed
[00:12:15.757 --> 00:12:16.257]  The new movie.
[00:12:16.337 --> 00:12:17.898]  I don't like the other Rockies.
[00:12:17.918 --> 00:12:18.919]  The new Creed's amazing.
[00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:22.040]  He deserves an Academy Award for his performance in that.
[00:12:22.301 --> 00:12:25.222]  The director is a great director as well, but I'm going to just get off that subject.
[00:12:26.743 --> 00:12:28.124]  It's all coming up today.
[00:12:28.264 --> 00:12:29.664]  Sean Penn and El Chapo.
[00:12:30.385 --> 00:12:31.505]  I wouldn't even get into this.
[00:12:32.446 --> 00:12:35.668]  Under the First Amendment, a journalist has a right to interview a criminal in exile.
[00:12:35.808 --> 00:12:37.949]  That's the Fourth Estate.
[00:12:38.789 --> 00:12:43.452]  The media is talking about arresting Penn right now because they want to destroy the power of the media to talk to people.
[00:12:44.793 --> 00:12:52.441]  That said, Penn, who I've met repeatedly, and I'm just going to leave it at that, is not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:55.492]  Everyone sits around telling him how smart he is.
[00:12:55.592 --> 00:12:57.112]  I mean, him and Josh Brolin, what a pair.
[00:12:57.892 --> 00:13:01.073]  Those two together, but he's just like a baby elephant.
[00:13:01.353 --> 00:13:04.574]  Josh Brolin behind him with a... But I'm not going to get into inside baseball in L.A.
[00:13:04.594 --> 00:13:13.397]  and what I've witnessed with my eyeballs at two different parties and then at a DNC event I was at covering things behind the scenes.
[00:13:13.437 --> 00:13:19.339]  But that said, he's got a right under the First Amendment and El Chapo used to be CIA drug trafficker.
[00:13:21.004 --> 00:13:22.766]  And I'm going to show you those articles on that later.
[00:13:23.027 --> 00:13:27.352]  They're just burning him now because they launched that whole drug war to basically collapse Mexico.
[00:13:27.632 --> 00:13:28.774]  The drug war allowed it to happen.
[00:13:28.794 --> 00:13:29.415]  I'll get into that.
[00:13:30.796 --> 00:13:40.118]  Continuing though, the Washington Post comes out on Thursday and goes after Hillary and admits that Bill's settled a bunch of rape cases and could be the next Bill Cosby.
[00:13:40.358 --> 00:13:41.798]  That shows you they're turning against her.
[00:13:42.418 --> 00:13:52.560]  Meanwhile, Kathleen Willey, who we've interviewed many times in the last 16 years, thanks Donald Trump for highlighting Bill Clinton's history with women, urges more victims to come forward.
[00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:55.021]  Is Bill Clinton's Bill Cosby moment coming?
[00:13:56.803 --> 00:14:05.447]  Well, Roger Stone's on with us tomorrow on the weekday show, and he's, let's just say, kind of like the shadow chancellor, the shadow campaigner.
[00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:08.769]  Anyways, torpedoes are fired.
[00:14:08.809 --> 00:14:11.310]  They've already hit Hillary hard and Bill hard.
[00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.391]  There's about five more torpedoes already in the water.
[00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:22.295]  And there's big, fat, juicy, high-explosive information warfare weapons on their way about to hit Bush.
[00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:28.518]  And we're going to watch old Jeb go... into the water.
[00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:32.740]  I love it!
[00:14:33.861 --> 00:14:38.084]  Two months ago in my office, Stone laid out the battle plan and it was beautiful.
[00:14:39.905 --> 00:14:42.147]  And we're seeing it take place right now.
[00:14:43.359 --> 00:14:55.583]  Hillary is on fire, and the flames are getting into the magazine of her battleship, and when they get into those shells, into those munitions, it's gonna be beautiful when she Death Stars.
[00:14:59.445 --> 00:15:03.386]  And Bill, another reason they're going down is Hillary's sick and so is Bill.
[00:15:04.687 --> 00:15:13.190]  And even though globalists hate the fact they've got all the blackmail material and they're insiders and we're CIA agents since they were like 22 years old, it doesn't matter.
[00:15:13.771 --> 00:15:26.616]  Because wolves see them weak and Hillary's stumbling around and Bill all stumbling around and the globalist wolves are snarling and stalking and can't wait to feast on the Clintons.
[00:15:27.196 --> 00:15:29.077]  And they are just ready to fall.
[00:15:30.427 --> 00:15:33.230]  I just can't wait till the moment I can announce the fall has begun.
[00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.692]  They're just teetering right now.
[00:15:35.372 --> 00:15:36.173]  Such criminals.
[00:15:36.493 --> 00:15:38.375]  Just teetering on their clay feet.
[00:15:39.076 --> 00:15:42.239]  And as they fall, so much other evil falls.
[00:15:43.721 --> 00:15:44.922]  Does it mean we're winning?
[00:15:44.942 --> 00:15:46.183]  It means we're in the fight.
[00:15:47.686 --> 00:15:52.429]  Mass radical Islamic rape gangs going crazy in Germany is now imploding.
[00:15:52.749 --> 00:15:53.869]  That fraud's imploding.
[00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.491]  We've got huge news on the economy.
[00:15:57.391 --> 00:16:02.914]  Huge news on what's happening in Spain that has portend and affects what's happening here domestically.
[00:16:03.315 --> 00:16:05.356]  It's all coming up straight ahead.
[00:16:05.416 --> 00:16:06.256]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:16:06.696 --> 00:16:09.038]  InfoWars.com is where the rebellion starts.
[00:16:09.058 --> 00:16:12.059]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:16:12.359 --> 00:16:16.982]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth,
[00:16:17.162 --> 00:16:17.602]  I don't know.
[00:16:38.815 --> 00:16:39.716]  Brain Force is here.
[00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:42.018]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:16:42.118 --> 00:16:46.841]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:16:47.101 --> 00:16:50.264]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:53.606]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:16:53.887 --> 00:16:55.628]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:56.768]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:16:56.788 --> 00:16:57.748]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:16:57.968 --> 00:16:59.809]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:16:59.969 --> 00:17:07.410]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:17.932]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[00:17:18.172 --> 00:17:22.793]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[00:17:22.873 --> 00:17:25.774]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense
[00:17:25.794 --> 00:17:25.874]  It's
[00:17:44.252 --> 00:17:49.233]  As verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[00:17:49.593 --> 00:17:54.354]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com about Winter Sun vitamin D3.
[00:17:54.634 --> 00:18:00.255]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[00:18:00.555 --> 00:18:02.336]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[00:18:02.696 --> 00:18:05.316]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:18:09.577 --> 00:18:11.199]  It has happened.
[00:18:11.219 --> 00:18:14.361]  2015 has passed into history, into lore.
[00:18:14.842 --> 00:18:17.684]  But now, 2016 has been born.
[00:18:18.145 --> 00:18:21.968]  And the decision lies in your hands to forge the destiny.
[00:18:23.209 --> 00:18:24.110]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:28.794]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure-science-fiction voice I'm using.
[00:18:28.834 --> 00:18:37.141]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real, natural nutrients it needs.
[00:18:37.401 --> 00:18:43.844]  And that's why we're offering the biggest discount ever on three of our best-selling products that turbocharge and cleanse the body.

[00:19:02.614 --> 00:19:02.994]  And see?
[00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:03.855]  I just did it again.
[00:19:03.995 --> 00:19:05.397]  I can't help but get excited.
[00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:06.137]  Get healthy!
[00:19:06.318 --> 00:19:07.098]  Fight the globalists!
[00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:07.959]  Win-win!
[00:19:08.179 --> 00:19:08.860]  Yeah!
[00:19:09.521 --> 00:19:09.861]  Secret 12.
[00:19:10.481 --> 00:19:13.224]  InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:19:13.504 --> 00:19:19.610]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:26.777]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:19:27.077 --> 00:19:35.926]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:19:36.206 --> 00:19:42.132]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:19:42.372 --> 00:19:45.515]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections and
[00:19:45.755 --> 00:19:46.556]  We're good to go.
[00:20:13.439 --> 00:20:16.161]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:20.785 --> 00:20:26.889]  I'm up here in space.
[00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.611]  I'm looking down on you.
[00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:32.394]  My lasers trace everything you do.
[00:20:32.634 --> 00:20:40.360]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.442]  These lyrics are from the 80s, talking about NSA spying.
[00:20:47.542 --> 00:20:49.404]  No longer a conspiracy theory, hmm?
[00:20:50.744 --> 00:20:54.807]  You think you private lives is nothing of the kind?
[00:20:56.228 --> 00:20:59.790]  There is no true escape I'm watching all the time.
[00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:01.932]  I'm elemental!
[00:21:02.732 --> 00:21:03.933]  My sight is clean.
[00:21:05.214 --> 00:21:06.875]  I am perpetual!
[00:21:08.336 --> 00:21:10.217]  Keep the country free?
[00:21:12.575 --> 00:21:17.979]  No, they used the NSA and these control grids for private globalist interests to blackmail and control Congress.
[00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:21.101]  I told you that over a decade ago with whistleblowers.
[00:21:21.121 --> 00:21:30.308]  And now it's all been confirmed by the former Technical Director of the National Security Agency, William Benny, right here on this broadcast.
[00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.393]  In this universe, there's always an equal reaction to tyranny.
[00:21:38.914 --> 00:21:40.515]  And in the end, it always trumps it.
[00:21:41.275 --> 00:21:41.936]  Pun intended.
[00:21:45.543 --> 00:21:47.745]  All right, let's launch into the news here.
[00:21:48.826 --> 00:21:53.189]  I mentioned the Trump situation, and I'm going to get more into that in the next segment.
[00:21:53.209 --> 00:21:59.034]  I want to get to other news right now, but I don't completely trust Donald Trump.
[00:22:00.255 --> 00:22:03.257]  I don't like some of the things Donald Trump says, I'll be quite honest with you.
[00:22:03.517 --> 00:22:05.559]  I agree with about 90% of what he says.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.983]  I've seen him, though, when he's wrong about something, change his views.
[00:22:10.463 --> 00:22:13.966]  And say when I'm wrong, I change him, like he said on my show a few weeks ago.
[00:22:18.697 --> 00:22:23.779]  But that said, I know Jeb Bush is absolutely horrible.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.941]  And I know Hillary Clinton is absolutely horrible.
[00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:29.562]  And I know those families are as thick as thieves.
[00:22:33.244 --> 00:22:34.064]  I'm not a gambler.
[00:22:35.224 --> 00:22:42.027]  But if I'm going through, like Indiana Jones, some Mayan temple, and a big boulder starts rolling down one
[00:22:43.601 --> 00:22:49.326]  Passage at me and there's no way to get out and spikes are popping up on the floor And there's only one other way to run.
[00:22:49.366 --> 00:23:10.065]  I'm gonna run the other way It's not even a lesser of two evils issue It's that I can't go this way with Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton I've got to support Donald Trump and then I see the entire establishment attacking Donald Trump and then Donald Trump reaches out through me through his shadow campaign head and
[00:23:13.459 --> 00:23:14.340]  And I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.361]  I mean, what are you supposed to do at that point?
[00:23:21.263 --> 00:23:21.764]  It's like the...
[00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.971]  Jail door opens and then we're the resistance.
[00:23:24.991 --> 00:23:25.651]  We're here to help.
[00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:26.732]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:23:27.312 --> 00:23:30.093]  And then Governor Abbott comes out and says, you want to confiscate our guns?
[00:23:30.133 --> 00:23:30.673]  Come and take them.
[00:23:30.953 --> 00:23:36.496]  And starts a state move nationwide to basically veto what Obama's doing.
[00:23:36.556 --> 00:23:38.096]  I mean, that's even more powerful.
[00:23:38.777 --> 00:23:40.177]  And impeachment moves are happening.
[00:23:40.237 --> 00:23:44.339]  I'm talking to the congressional aides and congresspeople during this weekend.
[00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:52.453]  You're going to hear in the next week to two weeks what the move is, and let me tell you, it takes some organizing behind the scenes and it's dangerous.
[00:23:53.094 --> 00:23:54.277]  You think our phones are tapped?
[00:23:57.232 --> 00:24:01.395]  The only reason I'm so prominent in this fact is there's so many cowardly men in America.
[00:24:01.655 --> 00:24:02.056]  You know what?
[00:24:02.096 --> 00:24:03.336]  It's beyond cowardly men.
[00:24:04.097 --> 00:24:17.426]  The average man, even if they're some guy worth a hundred million dollars that started his own business and is a great guy and really smart or whatever, they just don't see themselves as a fighter or that it's their role to be involved in politics.
[00:24:17.506 --> 00:24:19.788]  It's like that's something Martians do.
[00:24:24.891 --> 00:24:25.992]  No, it's something free men do.
[00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:31.829]  Texas governor challenges Obama on gun control.
[00:24:31.869 --> 00:24:32.490]  Come and take it.
[00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.631]  Then he came out and called for a con-con.
[00:24:37.553 --> 00:24:39.454]  On Friday, that article was posted by Drudge.
[00:24:39.854 --> 00:24:43.276]  Had over a million people as of yesterday when I looked at it online.
[00:24:43.536 --> 00:24:44.396]  So I can look at the back end.
[00:24:44.557 --> 00:24:46.978]  Over a million people on InfoWars read our article.
[00:24:47.298 --> 00:24:49.219]  Thousands of websites obviously reposted it.
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:58.805]  And now all these other governors are saying we're going to look at seconding your resolution to begin a constitutional convention of the states.
[00:24:59.758 --> 00:25:01.719]  To basically veto the federal government.
[00:25:06.222 --> 00:25:09.484]  Marco Rubio has joined him, which I don't particularly like.
[00:25:10.124 --> 00:25:11.305]  That's CNN politics.
[00:25:11.325 --> 00:25:14.207]  But the point is, that's 24-48 hours after he called for it.
[00:25:18.849 --> 00:25:20.690]  People say, well, I can't trust a con-con.
[00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:22.311]  They could rewrite the whole Constitution during one.
[00:25:22.832 --> 00:25:25.073]  They're already doing it with executive orders.
[00:25:25.193 --> 00:25:26.534]  I used to be against a con-con.
[00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:31.893]  But when they're already gutting you seven ways to Sunday, you don't have a choice!
[00:25:32.633 --> 00:25:34.554]  We're in a death battle.
[00:25:36.816 --> 00:25:39.337]  Obamacare is meant to bankrupt the country on record.
[00:25:39.678 --> 00:25:43.920]  Shutting off a thousand power plants, that's a third of them, is meant to bankrupt us.
[00:25:45.562 --> 00:25:47.283]  We are being gang-raped.
[00:25:47.703 --> 00:25:49.024]  We are being brought low.
[00:25:49.504 --> 00:25:52.066]  Like a pimp gets a young 16-year-old girl that runs away,
[00:25:53.336 --> 00:25:54.156]  This is the standard deal.
[00:25:54.236 --> 00:25:55.757]  It's Mexico, the US, Europe.
[00:25:55.797 --> 00:25:58.298]  It's all the same system for thousands of years.
[00:25:58.579 --> 00:25:59.819]  She runs away from Mommy and Daddy.
[00:25:59.859 --> 00:26:00.259]  He gets her.
[00:26:00.459 --> 00:26:01.120]  He treats her good.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.340]  He gives her food, takes care of her.
[00:26:02.801 --> 00:26:03.401]  Gets her in.
[00:26:04.081 --> 00:26:04.942]  Gets her in debt.
[00:26:04.982 --> 00:26:05.902]  Gets her on drugs.
[00:26:06.302 --> 00:26:13.726]  Two years later, he's putting cigarettes out on her and kills her in a parking lot and throws her in a ditch after 5,000 guys have basically had sex with her.
[00:26:14.926 --> 00:26:17.248]  That's what the globalists are doing to America.
[00:26:17.608 --> 00:26:21.850]  And I'm not going to sit here and watch them put cigarettes out on our eyeballs.
[00:26:25.094 --> 00:26:26.295]  This country is a woman.
[00:26:27.976 --> 00:26:29.277]  Every great ship's a woman.
[00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:32.200]  Every field you plant's a woman.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.342]  Every factory you build's a woman.
[00:26:34.582 --> 00:26:36.083]  Every business you build's a woman.
[00:26:36.323 --> 00:26:38.205]  Everything that produces something's a woman.
[00:26:39.006 --> 00:26:50.135]  And I'm not gonna sit here and watch Colombia, America raped by you people, and I'm not gonna sit there and watch it anymore.
[00:26:53.117 --> 00:27:02.004]  This country is not here for you to slap around and beat with coat hangers, because you're a bunch of pimps and think it's fun to desecrate humanity.
[00:27:04.946 --> 00:27:05.327]  It's over.
[00:27:07.468 --> 00:27:09.450]  And if you want to fight, you know you're going to get one.
[00:27:10.571 --> 00:27:13.733]  You've lost every time you've tried, scum, and you're going to lose this time too.
[00:27:14.736 --> 00:27:17.377]  Nobody's going to stop humanity's exploration.
[00:27:18.017 --> 00:27:19.798]  Nobody's going to stop our upward vision.
[00:27:20.218 --> 00:27:21.639]  Nobody's going to stop where we're going.
[00:27:21.659 --> 00:27:23.040]  I'm going to go to break because I went too long.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:32.024]  I'm going to come back with some of the clips I didn't get to, some I did on Friday, of the unbelievable Thursday night town hall with Obama.
[00:27:32.344 --> 00:27:35.025]  I've probably watched this clip, I don't want to exaggerate.
[00:27:37.847 --> 00:27:39.488]  Twenty-something times since Friday.
[00:27:40.229 --> 00:27:43.471]  I first saw it Thursday, and I played it Friday, and it was so weird.
[00:27:43.491 --> 00:27:45.192]  I watched it like four or five times that day.
[00:27:45.232 --> 00:27:49.014]  I watched it four or five times yesterday, and today I just watched it like six, seven, eight times.
[00:27:49.034 --> 00:27:55.318]  It was in John Ballin's report we played earlier, where it's done on purpose.
[00:27:55.358 --> 00:27:57.980]  It's all scripted between Obama and Anderson Cooper.
[00:27:59.582 --> 00:28:01.403]  And they go, is it a conspiracy to get your guns?
[00:28:01.463 --> 00:28:02.704]  Yeah, it's a conspiracy.
[00:28:03.324 --> 00:28:04.044]  It's a conspiracy.
[00:28:04.084 --> 00:28:05.025]  We're coming for your guns.
[00:28:06.285 --> 00:28:08.627]  It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
[00:28:08.667 --> 00:28:14.109]  And then later, in the hour-plus long deal, they do it again.
[00:28:14.129 --> 00:28:19.992]  And I hadn't even paid attention to that clip, because my kids go to bed about 9 o'clock at night, so I didn't watch it live.
[00:28:21.053 --> 00:28:26.115]  I spent time with them, got home about 6, dinner, hung out, did all that, watched some TV,
[00:28:27.748 --> 00:28:28.568]  Board game with him.
[00:28:29.169 --> 00:28:29.849]  Put him to bed.
[00:28:29.869 --> 00:28:34.111]  My son got up and knew what I was going to do.
[00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:35.692]  He came in and said, can I watch it?
[00:28:35.712 --> 00:28:36.452]  He's all into politics.
[00:28:36.492 --> 00:28:37.612]  I said, you ain't stay up until 10 or 11.
[00:28:37.872 --> 00:28:40.013]  And we watched the CNN deal.
[00:28:40.093 --> 00:28:41.014]  At CNN, the whole town hall.
[00:28:45.111 --> 00:28:46.492]  Yeah, I know, I know, I know he's lying.
[00:28:46.512 --> 00:28:49.674]  I was writing notes and... Man, these people are crazy!
[00:28:49.954 --> 00:28:52.295]  I mean, I was watching Obama and Cooper, the CIA guy.
[00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:53.956]  I mean, they're just freaks, man!
[00:28:54.236 --> 00:28:56.718]  They want to mount... What they are is wild hunters.
[00:28:57.258 --> 00:28:58.439]  And they want to mount us.
[00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:02.101]  The King 1776 on their wall.
[00:29:03.301 --> 00:29:04.902]  That's it, they're like hunting us.
[00:29:04.982 --> 00:29:06.063]  This is the whole deal.
[00:29:06.143 --> 00:29:07.504]  It's a... It's a death battle.
[00:29:08.877 --> 00:29:14.580]  Calls for President Obama's impeachment have circulated for years, but he's finally gone too far.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.922]  Steve Watson reports, RNC will consider Obama impeachment proceedings.
[00:29:20.342 --> 00:29:30.387]  A document titled, Articles of Impeachment of Barack Hussein Obama, consists of 48 criminal charges and is set to be weighed up at a January 13th meeting of the RNC.
[00:29:30.607 --> 00:29:35.189]  The resolution cites Obama's malfeasance, misconduct and abuse of the Oval Office.
[00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:43.051]  ...and includes the IRS targeting of conservative organizations and bypassing Congress with the use of executive action on key issues.
[00:29:43.531 --> 00:29:54.295]  Article 3 of the resolution states that Obama has been aiding and abetting known enemies of the United States, including the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hamas, and the Taliban, among others.
[00:29:54.615 --> 00:30:05.118]  The committeeman behind the resolution says that we are a nation of laws and separation of powers, and this lets the President know that we are not going to put up with his ability to go around the Constitution.
[00:30:05.518 --> 00:30:08.261]  Leanne McAdoo reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:30:09.923 --> 00:30:12.125]  It has happened.
[00:30:12.145 --> 00:30:13.426]  2015 has passed into history.
[00:30:13.967 --> 00:30:14.788]  Into lore.

[00:30:24.558 --> 00:30:24.838]  That's a-
[00:30:24.838 --> 00:30:37.483]  A little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure science-fiction voice I'm using, but quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real natural nutrients it needs.

[00:33:13.374 --> 00:33:22.603]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:29.369 --> 00:33:34.914]  It's always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt.
[00:33:35.555 --> 00:33:38.838]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not
[00:33:40.012 --> 00:33:40.712]  Increase our debt.
[00:33:41.293 --> 00:33:44.334]  It does not somehow promote profitability.
[00:33:44.654 --> 00:33:54.819]  All it does is it says, you gotta pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress.
[00:33:54.859 --> 00:33:57.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:01.261 --> 00:34:06.964]  So, raising the debt doesn't promote overspending, being in debt.
[00:34:08.925 --> 00:34:10.928]  Doesn't raise the debt.
[00:34:11.008 --> 00:34:12.850]  And Obama's not coming after your guns either.
[00:34:13.691 --> 00:34:19.338]  And you can keep your doctor, Obamacare's free, and there's no penalty and there's no death penalty, which they all admit wasn't true now.
[00:34:19.779 --> 00:34:20.860]  You can read the bill and see it.
[00:34:21.661 --> 00:34:26.267]  They just know that 98% of Americans, literally, do not go read bills.
[00:34:27.901 --> 00:34:31.083]  I'll be honest with you, the final health care bill was like 2,000 pages long.
[00:34:31.423 --> 00:34:50.635]  I just went to the Senator's warning about it, and searched the subsections, and saw where it had death panels, and written by foreign insurance companies, and lowered standard of care, and increased prices, and screwed everybody, and then... Goober, Grouper, whatever his name is, Jonathan Grouper,
[00:34:52.796 --> 00:34:56.157]  Comes out and says, yeah, I was hired to lie to the public and screw everybody.
[00:34:56.477 --> 00:34:58.357]  Thank God the public's so stupid!
[00:35:01.238 --> 00:35:03.119]  And then the media even tried to spin that.
[00:35:04.899 --> 00:35:06.560]  And Obama said, I don't know Gruber.
[00:35:10.101 --> 00:35:10.881]  There's all these videos.
[00:35:11.281 --> 00:35:13.821]  Thank Gruber for writing it all and helping me.
[00:35:13.861 --> 00:35:15.422]  He's the top genius on all this.
[00:35:18.874 --> 00:35:19.735]  It's like a language.
[00:35:19.795 --> 00:35:21.357]  It's like, I speak globalist.
[00:35:21.517 --> 00:35:25.621]  I'm not a globalist, but I study their lies, their deception, how they operate.
[00:35:26.583 --> 00:35:30.687]  And it's like the dumbest, stupidest Candyland game.
[00:35:30.947 --> 00:35:31.988]  It's not even hard.
[00:35:32.605 --> 00:35:44.953]  They just screw everybody, lie to everybody, rob everybody, tax everybody, while exempting themselves, and then prancing around saying, we're liberal, we're liberal, don't be racist, let us run your lives.
[00:35:45.434 --> 00:35:49.476]  And the average person says, okay, you're the authority figure, I'll do what you say.
[00:35:50.717 --> 00:35:51.858]  Here, let me bend over.
[00:35:51.878 --> 00:35:59.703]  I've got a baseball bat with nails on it, and they tell you it's gonna be the greatest feeling in your life.
[00:35:59.803 --> 00:36:00.764]  Let me tell you, it ain't.
[00:36:04.633 --> 00:36:07.956]  I don't even have the common decency to... What do they say in Full Metal Jacket?
[00:36:07.976 --> 00:36:13.942]  To give the guy a... But it's like all these Powerball people.
[00:36:14.082 --> 00:36:15.563]  I mean, they've rigged the Powerball.
[00:36:15.623 --> 00:36:16.504]  It's all a scam.
[00:36:16.544 --> 00:36:19.907]  You've got a better chance of being struck by lightning five times than to win it.
[00:36:22.096 --> 00:36:28.460]  The average bozo goes out there and does it because they want to think there's some magic unicorn that's going to make them successful.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:37.985]  When the magic unicorn's in your heart and mind to be able to create ideas and businesses and to build things and to be an actor in life, not a spectator.
[00:36:38.725 --> 00:36:39.626]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:36:40.689 --> 00:36:43.671]  I want to get into Trump leading the polls against Hillary.
[00:36:43.711 --> 00:36:46.033]  I want to get into the latest Muslim rape gangs.
[00:36:46.053 --> 00:36:49.135]  I want to get into very positive news in Catalan.
[00:36:49.936 --> 00:36:51.537]  Voting to separate from Spain.
[00:36:51.957 --> 00:36:52.998]  Why that's so important.
[00:36:53.058 --> 00:36:57.101]  The latest on Obama and Hillary and the whole rape crisis.
[00:36:57.521 --> 00:37:00.143]  Sean Penn and El Chapo.
[00:37:00.503 --> 00:37:00.883]  All of it.
[00:37:03.986 --> 00:37:08.429]  But before I do that, I want to go to some of these Obama clips because these are really important.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:19.888]  The first one is the wife of Chris Kyle, the Navy SEAL, says, why don't we celebrate lower murder rates?
[00:37:21.269 --> 00:37:26.213]  Now remember, Obama then starts stumbling and has to admit murder rates are down 61%.
[00:37:26.393 --> 00:37:37.882]  I kept saying 51, 52, but I've been corrected by top statistician on the air about the fact, but the Justice Department says it's over 50%.
[00:37:39.673 --> 00:37:41.234]  Because gun ownership's going up.
[00:37:41.254 --> 00:37:43.275]  Well, Obama says it's not gun ownership.
[00:37:43.715 --> 00:37:45.956]  In fact, the areas with guns have higher crime.
[00:37:45.976 --> 00:37:46.557]  That's not true.
[00:37:46.837 --> 00:37:51.579]  Chicago, New York, D.C., Mexico, places that have taken the guns have the highest crime rate.
[00:37:51.619 --> 00:37:53.580]  I mean, he is lying to people.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.541]  Can you believe that he would lie?
[00:37:55.601 --> 00:37:59.843]  The guy that says raising the debt doesn't raise the debt, or 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:38:00.163 --> 00:38:02.725]  I mean, can you believe he would lie again?
[00:38:04.321 --> 00:38:10.825]  It's like saying, can you believe Yosemite Sam has a red beard, and is short, and fires his six shooters?
[00:38:12.466 --> 00:38:18.609]  Can you believe that the coyote in Looney Tunes is a coyote?
[00:38:18.769 --> 00:38:20.530]  I mean, whoa!
[00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:22.031]  Whoa!
[00:38:22.451 --> 00:38:23.412]  I mean, whoa!
[00:38:23.592 --> 00:38:25.533]  I mean, if you believe he's lying, you're a racist.
[00:38:26.824 --> 00:38:28.005]  Nobody wants your guns.
[00:38:28.085 --> 00:38:31.026]  Everywhere they control, they take all the guns, but nobody wants your guns.
[00:38:31.466 --> 00:38:45.192]  They're just saying, we're just going to take them and put you on a secret list and just SWAT team you and just shut everything down and shut down gun shows and just do whatever we want outside of law, outside of Congress and Congress get in line and just, it doesn't matter, just everything's fine though.
[00:38:45.712 --> 00:38:49.254]  And fund Al Qaeda and fund ISIS and just everything's fine though.
[00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:54.356]  So, she says, why don't you celebrate this?
[00:38:55.096 --> 00:38:55.977]  And he lies, here it is.
[00:38:58.575 --> 00:38:59.876]  Murder rate, that's a big deal.
[00:39:00.056 --> 00:39:04.177]  And yet I think most of us in this country feel like it could happen at any moment.
[00:39:04.598 --> 00:39:05.658]  It could happen to any of us at any time.
[00:39:05.678 --> 00:39:07.339]  We cut the front off of that.
[00:39:07.359 --> 00:39:08.139]  Let's start it again.
[00:39:08.259 --> 00:39:09.560]  Let's start it again.
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:10.020]  No big deal.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:10.980]  Let's just go back to the front.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.761]  We're at an all-time low for murder rate.
[00:39:12.801 --> 00:39:13.662]  That's a big deal.
[00:39:13.842 --> 00:39:16.163]  And yet I think most of us in this country feel like
[00:39:16.883 --> 00:39:17.944]  It could happen at any moment.
[00:39:18.364 --> 00:39:19.685]  It could happen to any of us at any time.
[00:39:19.805 --> 00:39:21.367]  And I'm almost finished.
[00:39:22.047 --> 00:39:28.732]  When you talk about the NRA and after a mass shooting that gun sales go up, I would argue that it's not necessarily that I think somebody's going to come take my gun from me.
[00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:33.336]  But I want the hope and the hope that I have the right to protect myself.
[00:39:33.516 --> 00:39:36.599]  And Obama has bodyguards we pay for, but he wants us to be disarmed.
[00:39:36.619 --> 00:39:38.140]  I mean, what a piece of filth!
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.280]  I'm as good as you, filth!
[00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:40.861]  I got my own gun, you piece of trash!
[00:39:40.881 --> 00:39:41.882]  I'm gonna defend myself!
[00:39:41.942 --> 00:39:42.222]  We're done!
[00:39:42.242 --> 00:39:42.582]  Go to hell!
[00:39:55.908 --> 00:39:57.289]  Go to hell, you elitist bastard!
[00:39:57.309 --> 00:39:59.450]  I'm not your slave, you son of a bitch!
[00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:00.251]  Excuse me!
[00:40:00.471 --> 00:40:01.772]  Let me make a couple of points.
[00:40:01.872 --> 00:40:05.294]  First of all, thanks to your husband for his service.
[00:40:05.314 --> 00:40:05.875]  Oh yeah, thanks.
[00:40:05.895 --> 00:40:08.936]  They blow up Navy SEALs to cover up the figment of his imagination.
[00:40:08.956 --> 00:40:10.097]  They hate his guts.
[00:40:10.197 --> 00:40:11.238]  I mean, just shut up.
[00:40:11.258 --> 00:40:12.659]  He and your family have shown.
[00:40:13.059 --> 00:40:14.620]  Oh yeah, he wants to destroy the military.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.901]  He has more red-hot heels.
[00:40:15.961 --> 00:40:16.962]  I mean, he can't make this up.
[00:40:18.427 --> 00:40:27.011]  Number three, what you said about murder rates and violent crime generally is something that we don't celebrate enough.
[00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:29.672]  Because the media lies about it all.
[00:40:30.773 --> 00:40:35.555]  Violent crime has been steadily declining across America for a pretty long time.
[00:40:36.576 --> 00:40:40.718]  And you wouldn't always know it by watching television.
[00:40:44.414 --> 00:40:54.802]  Because we have the former Attorney General at the RTF National Convention on C-SPAN saying, brainwash the public and tell them guns are killing everybody and are the number one threat.
[00:40:55.202 --> 00:40:57.143]  Literally brainwash them is the quote.
[00:40:58.404 --> 00:41:06.310]  I mean, folks, you got more people die falling in the shower, it's like 15,000 a year, than die of goons.
[00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:09.072]  I mean, you understand that, right?
[00:41:11.501 --> 00:41:13.243]  And 7,000 plus blow their own heads off.
[00:41:13.724 --> 00:41:14.745]  You got bone cancer?
[00:41:14.965 --> 00:41:16.107]  I thought you're for a right to die.
[00:41:17.068 --> 00:41:21.493]  I'm not for suicide, but let me tell you, I got bone cancer and I feel like I'm being put in a wood chipper for a month.
[00:41:22.174 --> 00:41:22.835]  I might do it!
[00:41:23.756 --> 00:41:28.042]  So, more than half the deaths are suicide, jerk!
[00:41:29.016 --> 00:41:30.838]  Again, it's a total phantom menace!
[00:41:31.579 --> 00:41:32.440]  Total phantom!
[00:41:33.201 --> 00:41:34.322]  Total fraud!
[00:41:35.063 --> 00:41:38.427]  Guns are incredibly rare killing people!
[00:41:38.787 --> 00:41:39.989]  It's bull!
[00:41:40.389 --> 00:41:41.230]  Let's go back to it.
[00:41:42.091 --> 00:41:45.775]  Most cities are much safer than they were 10 years ago.
[00:41:45.795 --> 00:41:46.916]  The cities where you're taking the guns?
[00:41:46.936 --> 00:41:47.757]  Or 20 years ago.
[00:41:47.797 --> 00:41:48.799]  Chicago, New York, D.C.? ?
[00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:53.590]  The actual cities are safe.
[00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:54.690]  They're what's not safe.
[00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:57.671]  The reason for that is because there's more gun ownership.
[00:41:57.871 --> 00:42:07.335]  Because if you look at where are the areas with the highest gun ownership, those are the places in some cases where the crime rate hasn't dropped down that much.
[00:42:07.355 --> 00:42:13.618]  Those are the places where there's pretty stiff restrictions on gun ownership.
[00:42:13.978 --> 00:42:17.799]  In some of those places, the crimes dropped really quickly.
[00:42:17.859 --> 00:42:18.880]  So I'm not sure that there's
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.021]  Yeah, you're not sure.
[00:42:21.081 --> 00:42:21.701]  You're not sure.
[00:42:21.721 --> 00:42:23.082]  Oh man, they're so upset.
[00:42:23.582 --> 00:42:24.763]  The gun culture's growing.
[00:42:24.803 --> 00:42:26.363]  All the liberals are out shooting guns.
[00:42:26.403 --> 00:42:28.565]  All the feminists are out shooting guns.
[00:42:28.605 --> 00:42:32.647]  All the feminists are saying men might be okay and actually going and getting a good man.
[00:42:32.667 --> 00:42:33.887]  Oh my gosh, it's wonderful!
[00:42:34.307 --> 00:42:35.428]  Oh my gosh, I'm having kids!
[00:42:35.468 --> 00:42:36.469]  Oh my gosh, I'm a human!
[00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:41.571]  And the globalists, like an alien force from a trillion light years away, is just freaking out.
[00:42:42.171 --> 00:42:42.331]  Ah!
[00:42:42.392 --> 00:42:43.172]  Kill the humans!
[00:42:43.212 --> 00:42:43.712]  We hate them!
[00:42:43.752 --> 00:42:44.633]  I mean, they're scum!
[00:42:45.831 --> 00:43:02.635]  I'm going to come back and play more clips, then I'll get into Trump, then I'll get into Joe Biggs' report about radical Islamic centers getting hundreds of millions of dollars, one group alone, a year in the U.S., billions total of taxpayer money to actually set up Sharia law training centers.
[00:43:03.055 --> 00:43:05.296]  I used to hear this and go, oh, shut up to listeners.
[00:43:05.336 --> 00:43:06.036]  That's not happening.
[00:43:06.316 --> 00:43:06.636]  It is.
[00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:10.552]  It has happened.
[00:43:10.572 --> 00:43:12.434]  2015 has passed into history.
[00:43:12.975 --> 00:43:13.775]  Into lore.
[00:43:14.196 --> 00:43:17.058]  But now, 2016 has been born.
[00:43:17.498 --> 00:43:21.422]  And the decision lies in your hands to forge the destiny.
[00:43:22.563 --> 00:43:23.464]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[00:43:23.584 --> 00:43:28.168]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure-science-fiction voice I'm using.
[00:43:28.188 --> 00:43:36.515]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real, natural nutrients it needs.

[00:45:47.765 --> 00:45:50.987]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:45:51.067 --> 00:45:54.249]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:45:54.549 --> 00:45:56.310]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[00:46:09.219 --> 00:46:16.084]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.tv, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[00:46:16.124 --> 00:46:18.826]  We've always offered five months free.
[00:46:19.006 --> 00:46:24.570]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:28.091]  PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.
[00:46:28.331 --> 00:46:31.291]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.
[00:46:31.612 --> 00:46:40.293]  All of my documentary films, scores of e-books, and other exclusive documentaries are available for streaming or download in HD at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:46:40.574 --> 00:46:51.296]  You don't just get six months free when you sign up from Christmas through New Year's, you also get to share that membership with up to 20 people simultaneously using your username.
[00:46:51.556 --> 00:46:53.277]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:29.375 --> 00:47:32.598]  Another time where 2 plus 2 equals 5 in the age of 1.
[00:47:47.751 --> 00:47:51.653]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:52.374 --> 00:47:58.357]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:59.578 --> 00:48:04.902]  So the Monopoly-McDonalds game was rigged, and the Powerball a few years ago was rigged.
[00:48:05.762 --> 00:48:08.264]  But don't be a conspiracy theorist and say, this one's rigged.
[00:48:09.304 --> 00:48:10.525]  Just trust the system.
[00:48:11.726 --> 00:48:13.327]  Raising the debt doesn't raise the debt.
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.561]  And you didn't build that business.
[00:48:18.503 --> 00:48:20.185]  And nobody's coming after your guns.
[00:48:22.066 --> 00:48:25.109]  But MSNBC says the state does own your children.
[00:48:27.612 --> 00:48:29.794]  But we should all just lay down and go along with that.
[00:48:30.834 --> 00:48:32.636]  Let me now get back to one of these other clips.
[00:48:32.716 --> 00:48:36.500]  So I played the clip of where the widow of Chris Kyle, the most
[00:48:37.602 --> 00:48:39.143]  One of the most decorated Navy SEALs in U.S.
[00:48:39.163 --> 00:48:48.112]  history's comments about why don't we celebrate the massive crime rate drop thanks to gun ownership and Obama then starts lying.
[00:48:49.473 --> 00:48:52.656]  But he admits that crime rates are down, but he says it's not gun ownership.
[00:48:53.416 --> 00:48:56.599]  But there's an epidemic and gun crime's worse, so turn your guns in.
[00:48:56.619 --> 00:48:58.141]  Oops, but it is way down.
[00:48:59.722 --> 00:49:01.344]  But then we have this bizarre video
[00:49:02.805 --> 00:49:09.169]  of President Obama saying, yes, there's a plot, a conspiracy to get the guns with Anderson Cooper.
[00:49:09.729 --> 00:49:12.110]  And if you watch it, he's actually saying there's a plot.
[00:49:13.391 --> 00:49:14.071]  It's bizarre.
[00:49:14.552 --> 00:49:21.555]  And that ties to the mayor pro tem in Austin, Mike Martinez, who works for Bloomberg.
[00:49:21.595 --> 00:49:25.858]  He's gotten funding from him, openly saying
[00:49:27.662 --> 00:49:33.286]  That, hey, once we register your guns, we will confiscate them, which they've done all over the world.
[00:49:33.626 --> 00:49:35.747]  So let's go to this clip of Obama with Anderson Cooper.
[00:49:36.107 --> 00:49:37.568]  Is it fair to call it a conspiracy?
[00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:43.032]  I mean, a lot of people really believe this deeply, that they just don't trust you.
[00:49:43.232 --> 00:49:44.152]  I'm sorry, Cooper.
[00:49:44.192 --> 00:49:45.813]  Yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy.
[00:49:45.853 --> 00:49:46.654]  What are you saying?
[00:49:49.884 --> 00:50:01.672]  Are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns away so that we can impose martial law is a conspiracy?
[00:50:01.772 --> 00:50:03.053]  Yes, that is a conspiracy.
[00:50:03.353 --> 00:50:05.015]  I would hope that you would agree with that.
[00:50:05.615 --> 00:50:06.676]  Is that controversial?
[00:50:07.516 --> 00:50:09.918]  Except on some websites around the country?
[00:50:09.958 --> 00:50:18.024]  There are certainly a lot of people who just have a fundamental distrust that you do not want to go further and further and further down this road.
[00:50:19.945 --> 00:50:22.145]  I mean, I'm only going to be here for another year.
[00:50:22.165 --> 00:50:27.847]  I don't know when would I have started on this enterprise.
[00:50:28.488 --> 00:50:28.708]  Right?
[00:50:29.228 --> 00:50:30.088]  No, you're a front man.
[00:50:30.108 --> 00:50:31.008]  You're like shark teeth.
[00:50:31.749 --> 00:50:36.210]  I come from the state of Illinois, which... He goes on to say it's pro-gun.
[00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:37.091]  Turn him off.
[00:50:37.411 --> 00:50:39.071]  Which we know is total anti-gun.
[00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:39.671]  Moralize.
[00:50:40.152 --> 00:50:40.552]  For old.
[00:50:41.492 --> 00:50:46.234]  Now let's go to the clip of Mike Martinez a few years ago in Austin, Texas.
[00:50:47.162 --> 00:50:51.844]  at a anti-gun rally, and there's a fellow with a sign saying, no to confiscation.
[00:50:53.024 --> 00:51:00.006]  And he says, you can keep your sign, because after we do this, registration was what they were trying to pass at the state level, we're going to do that.
[00:51:01.247 --> 00:51:06.228]  And if you're a radio listener, it's powerful, but if you see the video, it's incredible.
[00:51:06.988 --> 00:51:09.009]  Because this is what's happened in every other country.
[00:51:09.129 --> 00:51:10.930]  Once they register, they confiscate.
[00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:14.791]  That's what Obama's now doing, outside of law, executively, here it is.
[00:51:15.747 --> 00:51:16.648]  Thank you so much.
[00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:27.939]  I've got a proclamation on behalf of the Mayor and City Council that we want to present.
[00:51:27.959 --> 00:51:30.802]  I want to say a couple of words, and I'll be brief.
[00:51:31.602 --> 00:51:37.808]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently.
[00:51:48.107 --> 00:51:50.589]  We will make your sign legitimate so you hang on to that.
[00:51:53.671 --> 00:51:58.715]  I mean, there's more than 15 cities run by Democrats that have banned all guns in this country.
[00:52:00.096 --> 00:52:01.277]  In the area they're in control of.
[00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:06.520]  And they sit there when Handgun Control Incorporated, the Brady Center, the U.N.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:16.823]  all say they want to quote, abolition on civilian ownership of firearms because it threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[00:52:17.223 --> 00:52:18.423]  That's a quote from the U.N.
[00:52:19.043 --> 00:52:21.884]  July 7, 2000 in the U.N.
[00:52:22.104 --> 00:52:22.764]  treaty.
[00:52:23.665 --> 00:52:24.865]  That was the treaty adopted then.
[00:52:27.819 --> 00:52:32.602]  A total abolition of civilian firearms ownership because it threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[00:52:32.962 --> 00:52:37.024]  And there is a power monopoly in North Korea where the state only has guns, and it's hell on earth.
[00:52:39.185 --> 00:52:42.787]  I hate even quoting lies that a power monopoly of the state is good.
[00:52:42.807 --> 00:52:55.935]  And imagine this mayor, guarded by armed police, says to a guy with a sign, peacefully protesting, you keep your sign, stop gunman, because once we pass this, we're going to make that sign a reality.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.943]  And I like the Austin Police Chief in many ways, but he was in here right after that happened.
[00:53:02.964 --> 00:53:05.206]  He said, Alex, he didn't mean that.
[00:53:05.266 --> 00:53:06.267]  That's not what he said.
[00:53:06.747 --> 00:53:08.569]  The guy in the crowd said that.
[00:53:09.911 --> 00:53:11.252]  They were really scared of that clip.
[00:53:13.374 --> 00:53:16.157]  No, that's what Mike Martinez said on Living Color Video.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:23.702]  And I mean, I could go join the elite too and call for disarming the public and they'd open every door to me.
[00:53:23.742 --> 00:53:24.482]  I'm not going to do that.
[00:53:25.222 --> 00:53:26.723]  I don't want to hate Mike Martinez.
[00:53:26.763 --> 00:53:30.785]  It's like, wow, you really are a Lex Luthor wannabe though with that shaved head.
[00:53:30.845 --> 00:53:32.845]  I mean, man, you really are a bad guy.
[00:53:32.985 --> 00:53:34.466]  I mean, you're a piece of crap.
[00:53:35.827 --> 00:53:41.589]  I mean, go to Nigeria or North Korea or somewhere else where they've taken all the guns and you live like a slave.
[00:53:44.534 --> 00:53:47.176]  Couple thousand innocent people get killed a year by guns.
[00:53:47.776 --> 00:53:49.977]  You can't penalize everybody else because of it.
[00:53:50.457 --> 00:53:55.800]  And let me tell you, out of 330 million people, we're like 380 million to count all the other folks that are here.
[00:53:58.222 --> 00:54:07.627]  Being wrongfully killed with a gun, I mean, you got a better chance of basically having a lightning strike here or something.
[00:54:07.647 --> 00:54:09.288]  I mean, it's real rare.
[00:54:10.889 --> 00:54:11.489]  They don't care.
[00:54:11.609 --> 00:54:12.790]  They make it the big issue.
[00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:14.211]  Let's go back to another clip here.
[00:54:19.343 --> 00:54:31.009]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip where Reverend Piggler, or whatever his name is, says, why can't we title guns like cars and have insurance and have biometrics?
[00:54:31.089 --> 00:54:31.949]  Obama calls for that.
[00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:34.170]  Because the power to tax is the power to destroy.
[00:54:34.431 --> 00:54:42.775]  Obamacare is insurance companies with a private tax, multinationally, foreign groups on us, and the Supreme Court said so.
[00:54:43.595 --> 00:54:46.857]  So, you can't penalize someone preemptively.
[00:54:46.877 --> 00:54:48.838]  It's like, why can't we have insurance on speech?
[00:54:50.759 --> 00:54:51.880]  Because it's a chilling effect.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.201]  It's a prior constraint.
[00:54:54.302 --> 00:55:01.067]  And they use insurance to basically end activities they don't want, like diving boards, and merry-go-rounds, and swings.
[00:55:01.568 --> 00:55:07.753]  The nanny state is the domestication of the public, and it doesn't keep us safe.
[00:55:08.053 --> 00:55:14.738]  But this pack of lawyers want to create a dictatorship and exempt themselves from it.
[00:55:14.758 --> 00:55:15.439]  Let's go to that clip.
[00:55:15.919 --> 00:55:21.943]  The reality is that I don't understand why we can't title guns just like cars.
[00:55:23.123 --> 00:55:27.826]  If I have a car and I give it to you, Mr. President, and I don't transfer a title and you're in an accident, it's on me.
[00:55:28.706 --> 00:55:30.888]  We don't take cars away by putting titles on them.
[00:55:31.068 --> 00:55:32.409]  Why can't we do that with guns?
[00:55:32.469 --> 00:55:41.414]  And every gun in America, so if somebody who's buying 200 guns, selling them on the streets, if they can't transfer those titles, then they're going to be held responsible for the guns that they sell.
[00:55:41.994 --> 00:55:51.986]  Issues like licensing, registration, that's an area where there's just not enough national consensus at this stage to even consider it.
[00:55:52.227 --> 00:55:58.855]  And part of it is people's concern that that becomes a prelude to taking people's guns away.
[00:55:59.395 --> 00:56:02.519]  One of those areas that I talked about... Yeah, it's registration.
[00:56:03.099 --> 00:56:08.125]  ...at the speech, part of the proposal, is developing smart gun technology.
[00:56:08.165 --> 00:56:09.266]  To ban all the previous guns.
[00:56:09.686 --> 00:56:11.208]  Now, this is an interesting example.
[00:56:11.308 --> 00:56:13.811]  I don't exactly understand... Congress smarts on the spies on you?
[00:56:13.851 --> 00:56:15.873]  ...somebody in the audience who explains it to me.
[00:56:17.735 --> 00:56:18.436]  Back in 1997, the CEO of Colt,
[00:56:21.483 --> 00:56:28.666]  Said we can design or starting to develop guns where you can only use it if you've got a chip.
[00:56:29.006 --> 00:56:30.647]  And Colt's totally in bed with the government.
[00:56:30.667 --> 00:56:31.447]  Band or a bracelet.
[00:56:31.487 --> 00:56:32.127]  I love Colt.
[00:56:32.167 --> 00:56:32.948]  They're bad.
[00:56:33.968 --> 00:56:37.189]  Protects your two-year-old or three-year-old.
[00:56:37.209 --> 00:56:40.911]  Love my Python, love my M4s, but man it's a bad company.
[00:56:42.211 --> 00:56:43.332]  A boycott was called.
[00:56:44.392 --> 00:56:44.732]  I guess so.
[00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:03.451]  To me, this does not make sense.
[00:57:03.471 --> 00:57:05.253]  He just keeps saying, lower your defenses.
[00:57:05.273 --> 00:57:06.334]  Lower your defenses.
[00:57:06.394 --> 00:57:07.014]  I love you.
[00:57:07.034 --> 00:57:08.055]  I'm your friend.
[00:57:08.175 --> 00:57:09.116]  No, you're not.
[00:57:09.556 --> 00:57:11.678]  You're a known globalist operative liar.
[00:57:11.718 --> 00:57:14.080]  Let's go to break.
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:14.641]  Shut him up.
[00:57:14.661 --> 00:57:16.783]  We're going to come back with a second hour.
[00:57:16.803 --> 00:57:17.944]  I'm going to finish more clips.
[00:57:18.064 --> 00:57:21.366]  I'm going to get into Donald Trump leading a national polls against Hillary.
[00:57:21.827 --> 00:57:23.949]  I'm going to get into the giant Muslim rape games.
[00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:27.492]  Rape gangs that are running around Europe.
[00:57:28.601 --> 00:57:29.742]  And that cover up and bloating.
[00:57:30.242 --> 00:57:32.384]  I'm going to get into Bill Clinton connected to all these rapes.
[00:57:32.444 --> 00:57:33.205]  That's coming out.
[00:57:34.445 --> 00:57:35.867]  I'm going to get into the economic news.
[00:57:36.267 --> 00:57:38.729]  I'm going to get into El Chapo and Sean Penn.
[00:57:39.249 --> 00:57:41.631]  I'm going to get into so much more.
[00:57:42.271 --> 00:57:43.652]  Straight ahead in the second hour.
[00:57:44.173 --> 00:57:49.157]  Now I know the NFL is more important than keeping your job or having your guns or your kids or private property.
[00:57:49.837 --> 00:57:51.158]  But we're weirdos.
[00:57:51.258 --> 00:57:52.259]  We're going to cover freedom.
[00:57:52.699 --> 00:57:53.280]  Straight ahead.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:53.800]  Stay with us.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:54.601]  Second hour.
[00:57:54.661 --> 00:57:56.162]  Tell friends and family tune in right now.
[00:57:58.757 --> 00:58:01.959]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:58:02.259 --> 00:58:10.263]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:58:10.503 --> 00:58:15.526]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:58:15.926 --> 00:58:18.207]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:58:59.719 --> 00:59:08.542]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[00:59:08.742 --> 00:59:15.024]  And it's all possible because in the hustle and bustle of daily life, we forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[00:59:15.244 --> 00:59:16.785]  The numbers are staggering.
[00:59:16.925 --> 00:59:23.527]  In the past five years alone, $41 billion of consumer gift cards went completely unspent.
[00:59:23.807 --> 00:59:26.908]  That's $41 billion taken directly from our back pockets.
[00:59:27.188 --> 00:59:28.229]  Don't let them win.

[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.063]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.828 --> 01:00:18.853]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:19.453 --> 01:00:22.436]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:30.506 --> 01:00:32.428]  Locked and loaded for a second hour.
[01:00:32.448 --> 01:00:34.009]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:36.751]  We're going through Obama clips.
[01:00:37.352 --> 01:00:41.655]  Then I want to air a Joe Biggs report on these U.S.
[01:00:41.695 --> 01:00:48.821]  taxpayer-funded Islamic centers across the United States, where unwitting general public thinks they're going to a private school.
[01:00:48.841 --> 01:00:53.505]  It's not advertised as an Islamic training center with caliphate law, but it is.
[01:00:55.353 --> 01:01:01.515]  But first, I want to get to a few more of these clips from Obama and the town hall with Anderson Cooper late last week.
[01:01:02.456 --> 01:01:07.338]  Mark Kelly said, how would government confiscate 350 million guns in America?
[01:01:08.618 --> 01:01:09.579]  You do it incrementally.
[01:01:10.279 --> 01:01:11.580]  You persecute gun owners.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.140]  You go after them.
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:16.321]  You scare most people into submitting and turning them in.
[01:01:16.722 --> 01:01:21.083]  And that's what CNN did an op-ed piece on Thursday that we wrote about.
[01:01:21.103 --> 01:01:22.304]  In fact, I'll pull it up right now.
[01:01:23.324 --> 01:01:24.625]  I've got it actually punched up.
[01:01:27.708 --> 01:01:33.589]  CNN calls for Obama to declare a national state of emergency to gut the Second Amendment.
[01:01:34.969 --> 01:01:37.050]  Then we link to the actual article.
[01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:47.892]  In the story, which is titled and written by Elliot Feinman, victims father Obama's gun actions won't make a dent.
[01:01:48.352 --> 01:01:49.732]  They just say, just confiscate them.
[01:01:50.092 --> 01:01:52.593]  And more and more, that's what Dianne Feinstein and others
[01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:55.972]  Are basically saying, but let's go to Mark Kelly.
[01:01:56.472 --> 01:02:00.275]  How would government confiscate 350 million guns, CNN?
[01:02:01.056 --> 01:02:13.144]  Often what you hear in the debate of expanding background checks to more gun sales, and as you know, Gabby and I are 100% behind the concept of somebody getting a background check before buying a gun.
[01:02:13.805 --> 01:02:20.189]  But when we testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we heard not only from the gun lobby,
[01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:32.940]  But from United States Senators, that expanding background checks will, not may, will lead to a registry, which will lead to confiscation, which will lead to a tyrannical government.
[01:02:33.191 --> 01:02:34.131]  Has everywhere else?
[01:02:34.191 --> 01:02:43.053]  So I would like you to explain with 350 million guns in 65 million places.
[01:02:43.073 --> 01:02:44.693]  He's wearing the lobbyist ring right there.
[01:02:44.833 --> 01:02:45.734]  From Key West.
[01:02:45.974 --> 01:02:48.014]  Obama's wearing the radical Muslim ring.
[01:02:48.314 --> 01:02:50.335]  350 million objects in 65 million places.
[01:02:50.375 --> 01:02:52.175]  Funding al-Qaeda to murder everybody in ISIS.
[01:02:52.195 --> 01:02:56.136]  The federal government wanted to confiscate those objects.
[01:02:56.256 --> 01:02:56.836]  How would they do that?
[01:02:57.694 --> 01:03:00.957]  What I think Mark is alluding to is what I said earlier.
[01:03:01.017 --> 01:03:08.863]  This notion of a conspiracy out there and it gets wrapped up in concerns about the federal government.
[01:03:08.943 --> 01:03:10.944]  Now, there's a long history of that.
[01:03:11.285 --> 01:03:12.226]  That's in our DNA.
[01:03:13.687 --> 01:03:19.191]  The United States was born suspicious of some distant authority.
[01:03:19.231 --> 01:03:19.811]  Distant power?
[01:03:20.814 --> 01:03:30.536]  He goes on, oh some distant power, and we played the clip of him at a university, there's one at West Point too, like, don't be scared of some tyranny, it's crazy, there's no tyranny, really?
[01:03:32.056 --> 01:03:38.037]  Hitler, Stalin, Mao, I mean, what are you talking about?
[01:03:38.758 --> 01:03:39.858]  What are you talking about?
[01:03:40.978 --> 01:03:44.659]  There's 200 plus countries in the world, like 209 or something.
[01:03:47.352 --> 01:03:50.574]  And there's like five or six where there's some gun ownership?
[01:03:53.857 --> 01:03:56.979]  And you look at us and you say nobody wants your guns.
[01:03:57.399 --> 01:04:03.383]  Let's go out to break with Donald Trump and his response saying eliminate gun-free zones in schools.
[01:04:03.564 --> 01:04:03.924]  Here you go.
[01:04:04.411 --> 01:04:06.433]  What a gun-free zone is to a sicko?
[01:04:06.853 --> 01:04:07.713]  That's bait!
[01:04:07.954 --> 01:04:09.435]  That's like gun-free zone!
[01:04:10.035 --> 01:04:19.002]  And then they walk in with whatever the hell they're carrying, and these five great soldiers, and I'm telling you, one of them was one of the most highly awarded ones.
[01:04:19.042 --> 01:04:22.765]  He was super shot every- He's not allowed to have a gun!
[01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:24.946]  All five are killed.
[01:04:25.587 --> 01:04:26.547]  Instantaneously.
[01:04:26.708 --> 01:04:27.708]  And you have other cases.
[01:04:28.469 --> 01:04:33.553]  I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and you have to.
[01:04:34.645 --> 01:04:39.413]  And on military bases, my first day it gets signed, okay?
[01:04:39.874 --> 01:04:40.715]  My first day.
[01:04:41.236 --> 01:04:42.838]  There's no more gun-free zones.
[01:04:46.124 --> 01:04:46.865]  I mean, think of it.
[01:04:51.716 --> 01:05:05.532]  A gun-free zone, a gun-free zone on a military base with some of the best soldiers we have, sitting there, relaxing, watching television, no gun, guy walks in, kills all of them, okay?
[01:05:06.193 --> 01:05:07.554]  That ends immediately.
[01:05:09.898 --> 01:05:16.380]  The Obama administration is pushing for the largest gun grab in American history.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:20.481]  We're also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient.
[01:05:20.821 --> 01:05:24.522]  And we're going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century.
[01:05:24.762 --> 01:05:29.063]  Anyone critical of the government could have their Second Amendment rights taken away.
[01:05:29.383 --> 01:05:45.151]  Simply if psychologists diagnose them with what they are calling oppositional defiant disorder, which the American Psychiatric Association describes as a defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority.
[01:05:45.391 --> 01:05:53.235]  Other measures will allow doctors to report patients to the FBI and RFID tracking with smart guns.
[01:05:53.475 --> 01:05:55.136]  We're gonna boost gun safety technology.
[01:05:55.416 --> 01:05:58.177]  We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer.
[01:05:58.197 --> 01:06:05.579]  If we can set it up so you can't unlock your phone unless you got the right fingerprint, why can't we do the same thing for our guns?
[01:06:06.039 --> 01:06:09.220]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:12.661 --> 01:06:20.403]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:40.654]  Now, I want to get into Donald Trump soaring in national polls, beating Hillary Clinton handily.
[01:06:40.674 --> 01:06:42.015]  I want to go over the numbers for you.
[01:06:43.116 --> 01:06:46.258]  But first, we've got an investigation that's taken us months.
[01:06:46.418 --> 01:06:48.399]  And this is just the first part of the investigation.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:58.726]  With David Knight, Joe Biggs, and others into this Gulan network that's gotten total billions of dollars, tens of millions, hundreds of millions a year.
[01:07:00.307 --> 01:07:03.008]  The group's worth more than $25 billion.
[01:07:05.347 --> 01:07:08.329]  And it's connected to all these radical groups.
[01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:12.953]  They promote a caliphate.
[01:07:13.033 --> 01:07:14.774]  They promote surreal law.
[01:07:16.876 --> 01:07:25.202]  And we were already on this last year before there were indictments made in the United States that the leader of it who lives here in the U.S.
[01:07:25.262 --> 01:07:26.183]  is not shown up to.
[01:07:26.203 --> 01:07:33.729]  And now we have connections to Hillary Clinton being funded by the very group
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:38.182]  Who makes contributions.
[01:07:38.282 --> 01:07:39.803]  Fethullah Gulen, the leader of it.
[01:07:41.104 --> 01:07:45.246]  Turkish Iman's USA Network of Schools to be investigated as part of a lawsuit.
[01:07:45.606 --> 01:07:46.987]  That started back on December 14th.
[01:07:47.227 --> 01:07:50.409]  Since then there were criminal charges and no one showed up to the events.
[01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:56.393]  Now the point in getting into all this, I'm not even saying this group's the end-all be-all of evil.
[01:07:56.993 --> 01:07:58.634]  I'm not saying they're out to even get us.
[01:07:59.555 --> 01:08:03.057]  I'm saying I can show you New York Daily News and CBS News
[01:08:03.971 --> 01:08:19.327]  Where aircraft are flying into the US, where hundreds of people get off from all over the world, and they don't even check their visas or their passports because they're from Latin America or they're from Asia or they're from Europe or they're from Syria.
[01:08:20.448 --> 01:08:25.053]  But then when I fly, they want to grope me and my family to train me to be a slave.
[01:08:25.133 --> 01:08:26.114]  It's all a joke!
[01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:32.674]  And it just illustrates how this war on terror is a way to take our freedoms.
[01:08:33.114 --> 01:08:35.096]  Now they say ISIS has U.S.-made stingers.
[01:08:35.336 --> 01:08:36.678]  Well, that happened in Benghazi.
[01:08:37.258 --> 01:08:45.646]  But the media, the London Independent, says they made the missiles themselves in the headline, but then later admit, no, they got them from the U.S.
[01:08:45.686 --> 01:08:47.287]  You mean the criminals that run the U.S.
[01:08:49.589 --> 01:08:51.051]  And then we come back from this report.
[01:08:51.071 --> 01:08:51.932]  I'm going to get into
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:57.901]  The thousand-plus men reportedly out molesting and raping women in Cologne.
[01:08:58.202 --> 01:08:59.762]  The police chief has been fired.
[01:09:00.062 --> 01:09:00.983]  The mayor's in trouble.
[01:09:01.363 --> 01:09:02.443]  But Merkel's on record.
[01:09:02.463 --> 01:09:04.744]  We have a video clip saying, let them engage in crime.
[01:09:04.784 --> 01:09:05.845]  You deserve it, basically.
[01:09:06.365 --> 01:09:08.386]  This is the leftist's bizarre death wish.
[01:09:08.826 --> 01:09:09.786]  That's all coming up.
[01:09:09.806 --> 01:09:16.529]  But first, here is the report with Joe Biggs and others into your tax money paying for schools.
[01:09:16.549 --> 01:09:18.830]  We're going to back it up.
[01:09:19.810 --> 01:09:23.812]  Your taxpayer money paying for schools.
[01:09:25.759 --> 01:09:26.400]  Think about this.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:37.170]  They actually teach Sharia law but look like normal private schools to accelerate your kids learning all over the US and almost all the teachers are brought in foreign.
[01:09:37.691 --> 01:09:39.693]  This is just an example of how wide open we are.
[01:09:39.733 --> 01:09:40.093]  Here it is.
[01:09:40.493 --> 01:09:42.816]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[01:09:43.116 --> 01:09:45.638]  Now we have covered countless terror attacks.
[01:09:46.139 --> 01:09:47.340]  But where do these attacks start?
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.102]  And what leads to them?
[01:09:49.642 --> 01:09:52.444]  Multiple attacks have erupted in Paris tonight.
[01:09:52.464 --> 01:10:00.130]  More than 120 people have been killed in Paris and more than 200 are injured in a series of attacks across the city.
[01:10:00.551 --> 01:10:06.596]  After the attacks in Paris, we began a trek across the country investigating the American caliphate.
[01:10:07.335 --> 01:10:17.562]  We went deep into the Catskill Mountains and investigated Islamberg, an area started by Mubarak Ali Jelani, the leader of the Al Fuqra Terrorist Organization.
[01:10:18.043 --> 01:10:26.449]  We then made our way to Dearborn and Hamtramck, Michigan, small suburbs surrounding the Detroit area that are predominantly Muslim.
[01:10:26.929 --> 01:10:30.132]  Then the attacks in San Bernardino, California unfolded.
[01:10:30.613 --> 01:10:41.824]  While investigating San Bernardino, David Knight spoke with the director of Killing Ed, a documentary exposing charter schools throughout the world that are led by a man named Fetella Galen.
[01:10:42.765 --> 01:10:45.287]  This is essentially a documentary that was about charter schools.
[01:10:45.747 --> 01:10:56.976]  They found that the largest charter school at the time, the schools being run by Fatala Gulen, was also the worst case example, according to whistleblowers, as to what could go wrong with charter schools.
[01:10:57.516 --> 01:11:05.442]  This whole organization and these schools that masquerade as schools of science and math are really about pushing Turkey.
[01:11:06.002 --> 01:11:10.725]  And we need to ask ourselves, why are they proselytizing so hard about Turkey?
[01:11:10.745 --> 01:11:17.248]  Of course, they can't directly proselytize about Islam, because then they would lose all their federal funding.
[01:11:17.529 --> 01:11:20.590]  But they do proselytize very hard with Turkey.
[01:11:21.111 --> 01:11:28.295]  Gulen is living in a self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania, due to what he says were for health concerns.
[01:11:28.855 --> 01:11:33.197]  Now, what we've heard is that this man was allegedly given a visa from the CIA.
[01:11:34.418 --> 01:11:37.161]  Many say Gulen is a front for the CIA.
[01:11:37.642 --> 01:11:47.133]  Classified documents obtained by WikiLeaks reveal secularists are convinced that the Justice and Development Party is the creation of the U.S.
[01:11:47.234 --> 01:11:50.638]  government and that Washington funds the Gulen movement.
[01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:57.274]  Fethullah Gulen is a Turkish Imam who is under investigation by the Turkish government.
[01:11:57.655 --> 01:12:02.679]  He wants to impose Sharia law on Turkey and eventually the rest of the world.
[01:12:03.199 --> 01:12:11.325]  He is also being sued by Robert Amsterdam, the founding partner of London-based Amsterdam and Partners LLP.
[01:12:11.926 --> 01:12:19.252]  They were hired by the Turkish government to expose allegedly unlawful conduct by the Gulen Network worldwide.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:33.611]  Our investigation led us to the Cosmos Foundation, which is an umbrella group for a vast network of charter schools, which is used to recruit young impressionable minds to accept the ruling law of Sharia.
[01:12:34.432 --> 01:12:40.396]  Now, 46 campuses are spread throughout Texas, with the headquarters being located in Houston.
[01:12:41.017 --> 01:12:48.163]  There are six Gulen schools in Austin alone, and over 130 charter locations around the United States.
[01:12:48.823 --> 01:12:59.066]  The Gulen-inspired schools are the largest charter network in the U.S., and they receive approximately $150 million a year in taxpayer money.
[01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:07.988]  The majority of the teachers come from Turkey, and a majority of the contracts for construction go to Turkish businesses.
[01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:13.110]  These actions alone should raise a red flag to the American public.
[01:13:14.042 --> 01:13:20.485]  Back on December 22nd of this year, Fethullah Gulen was a no-show at his first trial in Turkey.
[01:13:20.905 --> 01:13:34.332]  Gulen faces terrorism charges for being the leader of the Fethullahist terrorist organization, also known as FETO, and is accused of plotting to imprison his critics despite his repeated claims of innocence.
[01:13:35.333 --> 01:13:43.495]  Now an arrest warrant has been issued for 61 suspects and Golan himself for the reported involvement in the terrorist organization.
[01:13:44.236 --> 01:13:49.597]  So why do we have a man protected by the CIA that we know funnels millions of U.S.
[01:13:49.637 --> 01:13:55.699]  taxpayer dollars to his movement in Turkey, running the largest amount of charter schools in America?
[01:13:56.059 --> 01:14:01.761]  But we as American citizens have our rights trampled upon by the TSA and our borders left wide open.
[01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:11.764]  We know that the Obama administration funds and arms ISIS, and yet our Second Amendment rights are attacked every time a tragedy strikes our country.
[01:14:12.464 --> 01:14:27.889]  Now our government wants to bring in unvetted Syrian refugees that come from war-torn areas and are brought up with anti-American values, and also use fake passports to infiltrate refugee groups to get into our country and eventually carry out attacks.
[01:14:28.509 --> 01:14:30.129]  America needs to wake up.
[01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:31.550]  The time is now.
[01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:34.752]  Spread this video worldwide.
[01:14:35.152 --> 01:14:38.134]  People need to understand what is going on.
[01:14:38.615 --> 01:14:51.043]  Now, this will only be the first part in a larger series of investigations looking into the Golan Movement and what it means and what its future could possibly be here in America.
[01:14:51.323 --> 01:14:54.706]  This is Joe Biggs reporting from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:14:56.735 --> 01:15:06.862]  We just premiered that report that has never aired, that normally would air on the Nightly News, but we're airing it here today on the Sunday radio broadcast, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:08.863]  Central Standard Time.
[01:15:09.003 --> 01:15:16.548]  And this is mainstream news, that our government is funding these radical Islamic groups.
[01:15:16.628 --> 01:15:18.930]  And again, folks, I don't want to clash with civilizations.
[01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:20.591]  I'm not anti-Islamic, period.
[01:15:23.874 --> 01:15:34.836]  Radical organizations are being funded to take over the Middle East, to basically sabotage the Middle East, but also use that threat to take American liberties and freedoms.
[01:15:36.876 --> 01:15:43.177]  And now you see him doing it, saying we have to take your liberties away, we have to take your freedoms away, because the refugees have a bunch of terrorists in them.
[01:15:44.057 --> 01:15:44.958]  But who brought them in?
[01:15:44.998 --> 01:15:45.458]  The government!
[01:15:45.658 --> 01:15:47.898]  And who started the war to destabilize Syria?
[01:15:48.618 --> 01:15:50.539]  Egypt, Libya, and other countries.
[01:15:50.819 --> 01:15:52.779]  The people that have hijacked and run our country.
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:16:00.188]  Now when we come back, we're going to look at Germany, France, other European countries, where they've got hundreds of rapes being reported a day.
[01:16:00.208 --> 01:16:02.612]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:16:02.652 --> 01:16:06.497]  We'll explain why the government is covering that up by the radical jihadis.
[01:16:08.928 --> 01:16:10.529]  It has happened.
[01:16:10.549 --> 01:16:12.430]  2015 has passed into history.
[01:16:12.971 --> 01:16:13.731]  Into lore.
[01:16:14.172 --> 01:16:16.994]  But now, 2016 has been born.
[01:16:17.494 --> 01:16:21.297]  And the decision lies in your hands to forge the destiny.
[01:16:22.537 --> 01:16:23.458]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[01:16:23.558 --> 01:16:28.141]  That's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure-science-fiction voice I'm using.
[01:16:28.161 --> 01:16:36.487]  But quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real, natural nutrients it needs.
[01:16:36.727 --> 01:16:43.171]  And that's why we're offering the biggest discount ever on three of our best-selling products that turbocharge and cleanse the body.

[01:17:01.943 --> 01:17:02.324]  And see?
[01:17:02.404 --> 01:17:03.185]  I just hit it again.
[01:17:03.205 --> 01:17:04.747]  I can't help but get excited.
[01:17:04.807 --> 01:17:05.468]  Get healthy!
[01:17:05.648 --> 01:17:06.449]  Fight the globalists!
[01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:06.910]  Win-win!
[01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:07.070]  Yeah!
[01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:09.053]  I want more candy!
[01:17:09.073 --> 01:17:10.155]  I want more baby again!
[01:17:10.335 --> 01:17:10.876]  Mine, mine, mine!
[01:17:12.017 --> 01:17:18.046]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula.
[01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:21.407]  That was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:17:21.748 --> 01:17:24.289]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:17:24.309 --> 01:17:27.790]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:34.013]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globulous concoctions.
[01:17:34.313 --> 01:17:39.155]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:17:39.455 --> 01:17:45.636]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:17:45.836 --> 01:17:53.318]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:17:53.578 --> 01:18:00.839]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[01:19:47.627 --> 01:19:50.789]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:19:50.909 --> 01:19:54.130]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:56.211]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:58.272]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.

[01:20:13.326 --> 01:20:17.510]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:25.957 --> 01:20:31.502]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:20:32.002 --> 01:20:34.564]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:35.771 --> 01:20:40.693]  By the way, I know entertainment's just entertainment, but so much of culture is governed by it.
[01:20:41.233 --> 01:20:48.975]  And I went off reviews, I went on people that I'd talked to, to say that the new Star Wars was absolutely horrible.
[01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:51.596]  And of course, we had the spoilers.
[01:20:52.356 --> 01:20:54.457]  But I watched it, and it was pretty good, I actually thought.
[01:20:55.397 --> 01:21:03.719]  I mean, Princess Leia was absolutely like Hillary Clinton bossing people around and bitching at Han Solo, but Han Solo gets killed like Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[01:21:04.199 --> 01:21:05.619]  That's how Episode 4 starts.
[01:21:05.739 --> 01:21:16.461]  So, it's not as good as an Episode 4 or 5, but it's a lot better than an Episode 1 or an Episode... let me see, 4 or 5... 6, Return of the Jedi.
[01:21:16.481 --> 01:21:18.181]  So, I think it's a pretty good movie, actually.
[01:21:18.941 --> 01:21:21.722]  I rarely have to correct myself, but I've got to say,
[01:21:23.177 --> 01:21:24.318]  It's better than mediocre.
[01:21:24.558 --> 01:21:25.518]  Very entertaining.
[01:21:25.538 --> 01:21:26.839]  It was a good movie.
[01:21:26.879 --> 01:21:27.799]  It just wasn't deep.
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:29.920]  But it was entertaining.
[01:21:30.001 --> 01:21:31.321]  So I stand corrected.
[01:21:32.002 --> 01:21:33.943]  And I told folks I hadn't seen it yet.
[01:21:33.983 --> 01:21:36.684]  I was just going off the transcript and off the spoilers.
[01:21:36.744 --> 01:21:38.245]  But here I am.
[01:21:38.265 --> 01:21:40.666]  And of course I got reminded of that because I saw it about a week ago.
[01:21:41.026 --> 01:21:43.487]  Nico finally saw it, the main producer of the show.
[01:21:43.507 --> 01:21:45.008]  And he said, I thought it was pretty good.
[01:21:46.029 --> 01:21:50.271]  And I had been meaning to come in and actually do that Mia Coppa.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:53.422]  And just say, OK, I was wrong.
[01:21:53.442 --> 01:21:55.423]  It was not as bad as, say, Episode One.
[01:21:55.563 --> 01:21:57.785]  It's like three times better than Episode One.
[01:21:57.805 --> 01:21:59.466]  But Episode One is really bad.
[01:21:59.566 --> 01:22:00.947]  I mean, it's a really bad movie.
[01:22:01.888 --> 01:22:02.629]  So there you go.
[01:22:02.769 --> 01:22:06.231]  Disney has done better than George Lucas did in the last few years.
[01:22:06.291 --> 01:22:06.952]  Hate to say it.
[01:22:07.512 --> 01:22:08.873]  They'll say I've sold out to Disney.
[01:22:08.974 --> 01:22:10.295]  I just have sold out to the truth.
[01:22:10.715 --> 01:22:14.498]  And so I have to say the truth, even if I don't like it, even if it makes me wrong.
[01:22:15.919 --> 01:22:17.260]  So I agree with Obama now, too.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.162]  Raising the debt doesn't raise the debt, and nobody wants your guns.
[01:22:20.182 --> 01:22:21.103]  They're not coming for them.
[01:22:21.343 --> 01:22:22.924]  No, no, I'm joking, folks.
[01:22:23.184 --> 01:22:23.885]  We know that.
[01:22:24.185 --> 01:22:24.745]  We understand.
[01:22:24.805 --> 01:22:25.846]  We've seen this movie.
[01:22:26.106 --> 01:22:27.147]  We can give you a review.
[01:22:28.548 --> 01:22:39.656]  Now, speaking of seeing this movie, there are a bunch of Muslim countries that have some of the lowest crime rates in the world, that are very nice people, and are high level of education, and make good immigrants.
[01:22:40.717 --> 01:22:43.679]  Places like Syria, or Iraq before the wars.
[01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:46.521]  Not anymore, folks.
[01:22:47.702 --> 01:22:51.804]  And the West has funded all these radicals to come in and take over.
[01:22:52.504 --> 01:22:56.866]  But because the Russians and others have kicked them out, they've run to Turkey, which borders Europe.
[01:22:58.135 --> 01:23:05.140]  That was the big Western country that got taken over when Constantinople fell to the Muslims and became Istanbul.
[01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:22.092]  Turkey's working with the radicals, brings them in, and then in Muslim culture, in the radical countries, it's not in all Muslim culture, but in the Saudi Arabian culture and others that claim they're the core fundamentalist Muslims, a woman unattended wearing a beekeeper suit.
[01:23:23.288 --> 01:23:27.730]  To quote Stefan Molyneux, wearing a headdress, fully covered, what do they call it, burka?
[01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:29.170]  They can be raped.
[01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:34.212]  And then when they're raped, they can be beaten or executed because it's their fault.
[01:23:34.752 --> 01:23:39.594]  Just to be out without a man leading you by the hand in your beekeeper suit, you're not even beekeeping.
[01:23:40.635 --> 01:23:41.815]  Oh, I'm being against the culture.
[01:23:41.855 --> 01:23:42.155]  Yes.
[01:23:42.695 --> 01:23:46.997]  It's a culture that says we're going to take over and make your wife or daughters wear a beekeeper suit.
[01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:48.958]  No, you're not.
[01:23:48.978 --> 01:23:50.558]  I got a Second Amendment.
[01:23:51.039 --> 01:23:51.659]  Go to Hades.
[01:23:52.591 --> 01:23:58.015]  Now, that said, they bring in millions the last few years.
[01:23:58.115 --> 01:24:00.016]  I mean, it's like five million the last four years.
[01:24:00.296 --> 01:24:02.458]  It's a million and a half just in Germany last year.
[01:24:03.018 --> 01:24:04.339]  It is crazy numbers.
[01:24:05.179 --> 01:24:08.542]  No passports, no IDs, just like Obama's doing.
[01:24:09.282 --> 01:24:11.063]  And then they go out and party at night.
[01:24:11.143 --> 01:24:12.584]  Most of them are military-age men.
[01:24:12.604 --> 01:24:15.566]  A lot of them were smuggled in, promised all this free sex.
[01:24:15.907 --> 01:24:18.128]  They told them, you know, the Germans are all a bunch of crazy sluts.
[01:24:18.348 --> 01:24:20.710]  Because they watch Western television, they believe it.
[01:24:24.332 --> 01:24:26.533]  They don't get you up to ignore the women that get up and act like that.
[01:24:26.553 --> 01:24:27.974]  You don't run up and try to rape them.
[01:24:29.095 --> 01:24:31.937]  You got to tell them they're ugly to get them to do that, not rape them, dummies.
[01:24:32.397 --> 01:24:36.440]  Anyways, the point is, you just haven't figured it out yet.
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:40.462]  You're going to have them raping you if you figure it out and become a pickup artist.
[01:24:40.522 --> 01:24:41.383]  It's not an issue.
[01:24:41.783 --> 01:24:47.006]  But imagine third world populations running up to do all this.
[01:24:47.547 --> 01:24:49.528]  And then this happened New Year's Eve last week.
[01:24:49.568 --> 01:24:52.690]  The German military, government, government, all over Germany.
[01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:57.425]  From Frankfurt to Munich to Cologne, covered it up.
[01:24:57.565 --> 01:25:01.328]  Thousands of men just gang raping, beating women, breaking their noses.
[01:25:03.210 --> 01:25:08.835]  Let's play some of the video and audio for radio and TV listeners of the guns being fired, the fireworks going off.
[01:25:10.596 --> 01:25:12.077]  The police said it was like an invasion.
[01:25:12.118 --> 01:25:12.498]  Here it is.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:20.605]  Of course they had massive gun control there, but they magically had guns.
[01:25:22.076 --> 01:25:24.297]  Screaming and cussing, give us your women, Allah Akbar.
[01:25:25.477 --> 01:25:28.078]  Loading their guns, firing them in the air.
[01:25:30.238 --> 01:25:34.419]  If we just had gun control though, just like Mexico has total gun control, but super high crime rates.
[01:25:35.219 --> 01:25:37.120]  That's right, just fire your guns in the air.
[01:25:41.621 --> 01:25:44.602]  And they were just in Syria having their fun, but got kicked out by the Russians.
[01:25:45.562 --> 01:25:47.182]  Chopping heads off, everything else.
[01:25:47.682 --> 01:25:49.763]  And their camp followers just want to have a good time.
[01:25:51.806 --> 01:25:53.666]  He's like, I am liberal!
[01:25:58.627 --> 01:26:08.129]  So this is just, some towns of 100 people have like 500 people put in there and they just go, look, school kids, you belong to them, make their beds, give them food.
[01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:10.869]  They actually say, I'm allowed to rape you, Merkel says.
[01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:19.151]  Shock videos on Infowars.com, migrants in Berlin shooting guns, throwing fireworks, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:26:20.814 --> 01:26:22.475]  That's one of like 30 articles I have.
[01:26:22.515 --> 01:26:22.975]  Here's another one.
[01:26:23.155 --> 01:26:24.996]  Cologne sex attacks in Germany.
[01:26:25.056 --> 01:26:27.818]  Police chief is sacked over handling of assaults.
[01:26:28.258 --> 01:26:32.500]  Filed a report saying no incidents, no crime, no muggings, no nothing the next day.
[01:26:33.501 --> 01:26:36.622]  Even though it was just giant gang raping and the police standing down.
[01:26:37.523 --> 01:26:39.764]  They actually did the raping in front of the police station.
[01:26:41.225 --> 01:26:41.765]  That's funny.
[01:26:42.125 --> 01:26:43.126]  Anyways, continuing.
[01:26:44.176 --> 01:26:47.879]  Merkel to back stricter rules for migrants after cologne attacks.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.302]  She now says they'll check their IDs.
[01:26:50.662 --> 01:26:52.443]  They advertise everywhere, just come on in.
[01:26:54.085 --> 01:27:06.336]  Maybe they'll make sure the women, like, lay on their back and submit properly because the mayor, the big feminist, said you shouldn't dress sexy and you should learn how to fight back physically, but you can't have guns to protect yourself.
[01:27:08.197 --> 01:27:10.019]  So that's the news there.
[01:27:10.439 --> 01:27:17.565]  I'll tell you another country that's in major revolt over unlimited North Africa and other Muslims being brought in.
[01:27:17.585 --> 01:27:21.008]  I was in Catalan about three, four months ago.
[01:27:21.028 --> 01:27:22.529]  I always wanted to go to Spain and I went to Spain.
[01:27:22.549 --> 01:27:23.330]  It was very beautiful.
[01:27:24.791 --> 01:27:25.692]  And I go to the airport.
[01:27:27.322 --> 01:27:31.065]  And there are just streams of Muslims, and I was checking their passports.
[01:27:31.105 --> 01:27:32.425]  I saw them ahead of me checking it.
[01:27:32.566 --> 01:27:33.606]  They were all out of Libya.
[01:27:34.067 --> 01:27:35.568]  They were out of Tunis.
[01:27:35.608 --> 01:27:39.010]  They were, you know, they were all these different cities and countries in North Africa.
[01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:43.513]  And they were coming in, and they were not citizens, and they were being ordered to let in.
[01:27:43.533 --> 01:27:48.016]  And I was watching the border police just angrily stamp their passports and let them in.
[01:27:50.981 --> 01:27:54.024]  Then they use that to take this Spanish free speech.
[01:27:54.144 --> 01:27:58.467]  They use that all over with 47% unemployment for young people under 30.
[01:27:58.828 --> 01:27:59.888]  They use that to take their speech.
[01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:03.411]  And Catalan is somewhat French, quote, Spanish.
[01:28:03.852 --> 01:28:06.374]  But it's a culture even older that's Roman influenced.
[01:28:06.394 --> 01:28:09.817]  It's one of the oldest cultures in Spain when the Romans had bases there.
[01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:19.686]  You know, you see movies like, uh, Gladiator, and you're like, well, this is like a, you know, brown-haired, blue-eyed guy who's supposedly a Spaniard.
[01:28:19.706 --> 01:28:23.308]  Well, that's what Spain was, actually, out of the Catalan region.
[01:28:24.408 --> 01:28:26.369]  And so they got invaded by the Muslims.
[01:28:26.949 --> 01:28:28.250]  Most of the country got taken over.
[01:28:28.290 --> 01:28:30.270]  They killed all the men and enslaved most of the women.
[01:28:31.251 --> 01:28:35.092]  That was kind of a blessing for them to repopulate Spain, because they pretty much killed everybody.
[01:28:35.112 --> 01:28:36.113]  They didn't kind of populate.
[01:28:36.133 --> 01:28:39.034]  They just murdered everybody and ran off with the women to Africa.
[01:28:40.254 --> 01:28:43.196]  Uh, but now Catalan separatists back new leader.
[01:28:43.956 --> 01:28:46.958]  They've now seceded by law, not with guns, not with any of that.
[01:28:47.238 --> 01:28:48.198]  They just have seceded.
[01:28:48.639 --> 01:28:55.943]  The vast majority voted to leave Spain, and Spain's trying to threaten actions, but they can't, because the Catalonians just refuse to pay taxes.
[01:28:55.963 --> 01:29:02.066]  They're not pulling guns out or wearing camo, and I'm not against that, but they're just effectively, you know, taking their country back.
[01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:05.328]  And it's got the incredibly corrupt government of Spain freaking out.
[01:29:05.668 --> 01:29:07.209]  We'll cover that more coming back.
[01:29:07.229 --> 01:29:07.589]  Stay with us.
[01:29:08.795 --> 01:29:13.596]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:16.290]  In the 15-year history of PrisonPlanet.TV, we have never offered six months free at Christmas.
[01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:19.094]  We've always offered five months free.
[01:31:19.275 --> 01:31:24.823]  But since I announced six free months a few days ago, we have seen record numbers of sign-ups.
[01:31:25.163 --> 01:31:28.364]  PrisonPlanet.tv began 15 years ago.
[01:31:28.604 --> 01:31:31.565]  It's grown into InfoWars, Nightly News, and so much more.

[01:32:09.378 --> 01:32:15.403]  Our bloated federal government and a coterie of megacorporations are hoping that we all have the memory of a goldfish.
[01:32:15.584 --> 01:32:18.506]  We forget to use those holiday gift cards.
[01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:27.654]  Every year, millions of Americans are unknowingly letting government institutions and megacorporations steal billions of dollars of their money.
[01:32:27.935 --> 01:32:30.657]  Instead, use your gift cards to help support the info
[01:32:30.657 --> 01:32:31.238]  I don't know.
[01:32:50.399 --> 01:32:52.280]  Don't throw those gift cards away.
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:33:01.044]  Use that money to get high quality products and save 15% in the process all the while funding the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty worldwide.
[01:33:01.224 --> 01:33:02.445]  That's a 360 win.
[01:33:02.605 --> 01:33:04.326]  Don't donate your money to the banksters.
[01:33:04.466 --> 01:33:08.788]  Visit InfoWarsTore.com and help fund the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty.
[01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:15.471]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:30.592 --> 01:33:32.753]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:33.213 --> 01:33:34.553]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.953 --> 01:33:38.114]  When the blood runs high, give it to me easy.
[01:33:48.044 --> 01:33:51.465]  All right, we're not taking any calls today, but I will take calls tomorrow.
[01:33:51.485 --> 01:33:52.605]  11 a.m.
[01:33:52.625 --> 01:33:53.246]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:53.286 --> 01:33:56.467]  Central with a four-hour weekday radio broadcast.
[01:33:56.507 --> 01:33:58.147]  It's been on air for 19 years.
[01:33:59.227 --> 01:34:03.149]  I've been on air 21 years total in April.
[01:34:03.169 --> 01:34:09.390]  It's hard to believe we've been syndicated for 19 years.
[01:34:10.971 --> 01:34:11.151]  Look,
[01:34:12.776 --> 01:34:14.017]  I'm not trying to be negative here.
[01:34:14.558 --> 01:34:20.163]  There's lots of positive stuff I can tell you, but positive stuff doesn't need to be attacked or resisted.
[01:34:20.884 --> 01:34:21.924]  It can stand on its own.
[01:34:24.247 --> 01:34:31.914]  Obamacare, the gun grabs, the open borders, the paramilitary militarization of our local government.
[01:34:32.574 --> 01:34:38.360]  All of this is the real issues that historically end up being major disasters.
[01:34:39.844 --> 01:34:41.565]  Now I want to cover three things right now.
[01:34:41.645 --> 01:34:44.046]  Some of these I've already mentioned, but I want to drill deeper into them.
[01:34:45.667 --> 01:34:57.573]  Trump surging into leadership position, not just of the RNC, Republican candidates, but against Hillary and that creature Bernie Sanders.
[01:34:58.574 --> 01:35:05.958]  Then, a 15-year armed standoff, the longest in U.S., maybe world history, ended
[01:35:07.062 --> 01:35:10.684]  Really last year, but it was announced yesterday in the Dallas Morning News.
[01:35:11.404 --> 01:35:15.706]  And then my take on the Powerball, the biggest in history as well.
[01:35:17.127 --> 01:35:20.068]  And more on the Catalan separatist.
[01:35:20.788 --> 01:35:26.371]  Then we'll get into more on Hillary and mainstream media saying her husband settled rape cases.
[01:35:26.771 --> 01:35:33.394]  I was covering that in 97, 98 with Kathleen, Willie and others, Jennifer Flowers, you name it.
[01:35:35.035 --> 01:35:35.715]  But now,
[01:35:39.085 --> 01:35:40.406]  Now it's in the news.
[01:35:41.606 --> 01:35:42.927]  Nobody said he raped Flowers.
[01:35:42.947 --> 01:35:45.588]  She was a mistress, but the point is, she was in the news.
[01:35:46.409 --> 01:35:46.889]  Bill Clinton.
[01:35:47.469 --> 01:35:48.810]  It's a big deal to have that out.
[01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:50.331]  It shows you where the system's going.
[01:35:50.351 --> 01:35:52.652]  But getting back to Catalan.
[01:35:54.933 --> 01:35:57.774]  Spain has been fascist since World War II.
[01:35:58.074 --> 01:35:59.015]  Before World War II.
[01:36:00.535 --> 01:36:07.439]  And the King of Spain, Juan Carlos, who was the aide apparent to the dictator of Spain, who brought back the monarchy,
[01:36:09.088 --> 01:36:10.429]  is far from a fascist.
[01:36:10.449 --> 01:36:11.809]  And I'm not endorsing fascism.
[01:36:14.290 --> 01:36:18.912]  But Franco brought in a type of corporate fascism that's socialist for the general public.
[01:36:19.533 --> 01:36:25.775]  And again, they've got 45-50 percent unemployment for young men and women below the age of 30 in Spain.
[01:36:26.236 --> 01:36:27.536]  They've got carbon taxes.
[01:36:27.576 --> 01:36:29.057]  They're following the globalist model.
[01:36:29.557 --> 01:36:30.377]  It is hellish.
[01:36:31.138 --> 01:36:35.840]  And Catalan has always been one of the hardest working, most industrious groups
[01:36:37.199 --> 01:36:49.130]  And that doesn't really identify with Madrid, because it's up in the northeast, bordering the mountains between that and France, is saying, we're not part of this.
[01:36:50.011 --> 01:37:01.381]  And they're saying, it's not that we don't want to just be part of Spain, we identify with being part Spanish, it's that Spain is Euro, Spain is globalist, Spain is corrupt, Spain
[01:37:03.021 --> 01:37:07.222]  Taxes us at higher rates than the rest of the country because we're so productive, we're done.
[01:37:07.643 --> 01:37:13.905]  And I'm telling you, almost every house, almost every apartment window had a Catalonian flag hanging when I was there last year.
[01:37:16.025 --> 01:37:20.447]  And this is the model, and I'm going to get to this in a moment, of how to really get out of systems.
[01:37:20.727 --> 01:37:21.347]  How to say no.
[01:37:21.387 --> 01:37:23.628]  Because I'm all for the Republic, I'm all for America.
[01:37:25.652 --> 01:37:27.473]  It's not perfect, but it's better than other countries.
[01:37:27.513 --> 01:37:37.678]  But if it's gone and turned globalist, and all that's left is the flag, then have Texas and Oklahoma, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, New Mexico secede.
[01:37:39.658 --> 01:37:43.760]  I mean, I believe our governors, our politicians, our citizens can have a better effect there.
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:49.843]  I mean, look, Texas is already boom compared to the rest of the country, just because we have a little bit lower taxes.
[01:37:50.103 --> 01:37:51.244]  It's already super high.
[01:37:53.766 --> 01:37:58.090]  I mean, California's got like 70% taxes with federal, state, and all the rest.
[01:37:58.130 --> 01:38:02.233]  I mean, how can anybody... You make 60, 70 grand a year, you pay like 70% taxes.
[01:38:02.654 --> 01:38:03.254]  France is like 87%.
[01:38:06.157 --> 01:38:09.860]  If you make a million euros a year in France, you pay 101% tax.
[01:38:10.821 --> 01:38:12.502]  People say, well, that'll bankrupt somebody.
[01:38:12.522 --> 01:38:13.423]  That's the whole plan.
[01:38:14.565 --> 01:38:20.588]  Because the big ruling Socialist Party, it's been in the news for four years, does not pay taxes and no one enforces!
[01:38:21.308 --> 01:38:23.249]  And they go, Hollande, you don't pay taxes.
[01:38:23.269 --> 01:38:24.650]  He just goes, no comment.
[01:38:25.630 --> 01:38:26.051]  Look it up.
[01:38:26.811 --> 01:38:29.912]  French elite caught with Swiss bank accounts not paying taxes.
[01:38:30.833 --> 01:38:31.513]  The Socialists.
[01:38:32.914 --> 01:38:38.697]  See, if other people aren't enforced on with taxes, they're going to raise them forever.
[01:38:39.237 --> 01:38:39.677]  Why not?
[01:38:39.937 --> 01:38:41.338]  You're going to go out of business, they won't.
[01:38:41.618 --> 01:38:43.019]  They're going to be able to take over!
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:56.702]  Catalonia's pro-independence parties agreed on Saturday on a new leader clearing the way for the creation of a regional government and raising pressure on national parties in Madrid to form a broad coalition to oppose the separatist drive.
[01:38:58.562 --> 01:39:02.463]  And by the way, every other region on their border now is joining and going, we want to leave too.
[01:39:02.583 --> 01:39:03.703]  See how that's infectious?
[01:39:05.163 --> 01:39:13.425]  The parties agreed to back Carles Puigdemont, if I pronounced that right, a fiery separatist
[01:39:14.485 --> 01:39:24.309]  And a vote due on Sunday came after the region's acting head, Artur Mas, said he would step down in an attempt to break months of political deadlock in Spain's wealthiest region.
[01:39:24.329 --> 01:39:28.151]  And it's the wealthiest region just because they're hard-working folks.
[01:39:28.211 --> 01:39:29.151]  I loved them when I was there.
[01:39:29.672 --> 01:39:32.373]  I mean, it was just like buzzing around, working, having fun, doing stuff.
[01:39:32.413 --> 01:39:35.154]  There weren't a bunch of chip-on-the-shoulder, griping young people.
[01:39:35.674 --> 01:39:36.675]  Oh, I gotta wait tables.
[01:39:36.975 --> 01:39:38.075]  Oh, I gotta drive a taxi.
[01:39:38.536 --> 01:39:39.576]  Oh, I gotta own a hotel.
[01:39:39.716 --> 01:39:43.778]  Oh, I gotta... Like you pick up in trendy slacker areas.
[01:39:44.650 --> 01:39:53.297]  There's this whole movement now to text message and to put out on Twitter that you oppose capitalism on your capitalist slave-made phone.
[01:39:54.959 --> 01:39:56.660]  Because a crummy capitalist system did that.
[01:39:59.963 --> 01:40:08.931]  Catalonian politicians have been able to form a government since September regional election due to disagreements between the pro-independence parties that together hold a majority in the Barcelona Assembly.
[01:40:09.721 --> 01:40:10.101]  You hear that?
[01:40:10.121 --> 01:40:13.544]  The independence parties hold the majority of the Barcelona Assembly.
[01:40:13.784 --> 01:40:16.106]  They've already, they started out just to get Catalonia free.
[01:40:16.446 --> 01:40:19.388]  They already have enough to take over the whole country!
[01:40:19.648 --> 01:40:21.269]  That's how much people want change!
[01:40:21.549 --> 01:40:22.970]  Just like Trump ain't perfect!
[01:40:24.672 --> 01:40:28.274]  But he isn't the ruling elite, and if he doesn't do what we want, we'll kick his ass out!
[01:40:28.835 --> 01:40:32.377]  John Boehner's gone, Paul Ryan doesn't do what we want, we'll kick him out!
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:37.661]  So I'm done talking about that.
[01:40:39.375 --> 01:40:40.636]  I'm gonna go to break due to time.
[01:40:40.656 --> 01:40:48.579]  And when we come back, I'm gonna hit the Trump news, how he's in the lead in all these big polls nationally, not just to the Republican heap.
[01:40:49.179 --> 01:40:50.900]  It's his to walk away with, his to lose.
[01:40:52.961 --> 01:40:55.462]  And then a 15-year arm standoff quietly ends.
[01:40:55.782 --> 01:41:01.445]  Now I'm not talking about the new 15-year arm standoff out with the Bundys out in Oregon that I've been
[01:41:02.423 --> 01:41:03.804]  Critical of, you know, how they're doing.
[01:41:03.844 --> 01:41:04.705]  And I'm not against them.
[01:41:04.765 --> 01:41:06.387]  I just have some points to make.
[01:41:06.407 --> 01:41:07.468]  You know, they're like, how dare you?
[01:41:07.488 --> 01:41:08.629]  You must salute everything we do.
[01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:09.029]  You're bad.
[01:41:09.289 --> 01:41:14.454]  Not the Bundys, but their militia people, the commandos that we've learned about their military service.
[01:41:14.474 --> 01:41:16.416]  We're going to, or lack of, we're going to be covering soon.
[01:41:19.468 --> 01:41:42.483]  I want to just dovetail what Catalonia's done, moving towards taking their country back, what the Texas governor's doing, saying we're not going to play ball with all this, we're going to veto your gun grabs, all these sheriffs saying, all these police chiefs saying we're not going to go along on gun confiscation, moves to have the states align and basically point out the federal government's been dissolved, which the states can do under CONCON, and re-establish the federal government.
[01:41:42.743 --> 01:41:44.164]  The states can impeach Obama.
[01:41:44.645 --> 01:41:45.665]  So that's all coming up.
[01:41:45.685 --> 01:41:46.486]  This is big news.
[01:41:48.456 --> 01:41:51.237]  But before I do that, one plug here on the show.
[01:41:52.498 --> 01:41:53.538]  We were going to end it Friday.

[01:43:50.282 --> 01:43:53.464]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:43:53.764 --> 01:43:55.465]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:43:55.725 --> 01:43:56.646]  It doesn't have stimulants.

[01:43:57.848 --> 01:43:59.750]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:44:04.957 --> 01:44:06.539]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:44:12.546 --> 01:44:18.668]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:44:18.848 --> 01:44:25.831]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:44:26.131 --> 01:44:34.934]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive perfected process.
[01:44:35.254 --> 01:44:41.178]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:44:41.418 --> 01:44:46.181]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:44:46.241 --> 01:44:49.584]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:44:49.844 --> 01:44:51.465]  No needles, no injections.
[01:44:51.725 --> 01:44:53.226]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:44:53.386 --> 01:44:54.427]  Try it for yourself.
[01:44:54.587 --> 01:44:56.148]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[01:45:05.775 --> 01:45:11.621]  It has happened.
[01:45:11.641 --> 01:45:12.963]  2015 has passed into history.
[01:45:13.483 --> 01:45:14.264]  Into lore.
[01:45:14.684 --> 01:45:17.548]  But now, 2016 has been born.
[01:45:18.008 --> 01:45:21.932]  And the decision lies in your hands to forge the destiny!
[01:45:23.054 --> 01:45:23.875]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[01:45:24.275 --> 01:45:37.003]  It's a little too epic, that Hollywood action-adventure science-fiction voice I'm using, but quite frankly, that's how I feel like I should be talking about what happens when your body actually gets the real, natural nutrients it needs.
[01:45:37.243 --> 01:45:43.687]  And that's why we're offering the biggest discount ever on three of our best-selling products that turbocharge and cleanse the body.

[01:46:08.043 --> 01:46:08.624]  Yeah!

[01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:23.493]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:46:23.594 --> 01:46:27.977]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[01:46:28.357 --> 01:46:31.280]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:33.523]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:46:33.843 --> 01:46:37.267]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.

[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:55.084]  Read the facts at Infowarslife.com about Winter Sun, Vitamin D3.

[01:47:06.213 --> 01:47:08.255]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.045 --> 01:47:25.526]  We are on the march.
[01:47:25.887 --> 01:47:28.289]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:47:29.049 --> 01:47:32.812]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:34.373 --> 01:47:39.538]  I had a couple hundred squats and deadlifts yesterday.
[01:47:39.578 --> 01:47:43.401]  Boy, I tell you, my legs are sore.
[01:47:43.421 --> 01:47:43.961]  300 push-ups.
[01:47:44.201 --> 01:47:46.163]  It's not that much for some people, but it's a lot for me.
[01:47:46.183 --> 01:47:47.704]  Worked out about an hour and a half.
[01:47:47.784 --> 01:47:48.285]  But you know what?
[01:47:48.725 --> 01:47:53.169]  The good news is that pain was actually enjoyable compared to being a jellyfish.
[01:47:54.110 --> 01:47:55.511]  And that's really the name of the game.
[01:47:56.072 --> 01:48:01.676]  If we don't get politically active, politically informed, politically involved, we'll be slaves.
[01:48:01.756 --> 01:48:03.477]  We turn our lives over to other people.
[01:48:04.518 --> 01:48:07.760]  And all I'm trying to do is illustrate to people how we're being screwed over.
[01:48:09.221 --> 01:48:13.405]  You don't have to have my perspective or even see things the way I do.
[01:48:14.206 --> 01:48:17.908]  Well you can think for yourself and realize you're being lied to by the mainstream media.
[01:48:18.588 --> 01:48:24.771]  So let me go back over some of these stories and hit some of the ones I haven't gotten to yet here in closing and then I'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m.
[01:48:24.791 --> 01:48:25.391]  to 3 p.m.
[01:48:25.671 --> 01:48:26.792]  with the weekday transmission.
[01:48:26.832 --> 01:48:28.853]  I'm very honored and thankful that you've joined us today.
[01:48:30.593 --> 01:48:31.154]  Economist.
[01:48:31.214 --> 01:48:33.995]  GOP may win 47 states in general election.
[01:48:34.555 --> 01:48:36.036]  That is the hill.
[01:48:37.307 --> 01:48:44.719]  Supply-side economist Arthur Leffer is predicting Republicans will win the White House in a landslide this year, regardless of the nominee.
[01:48:46.212 --> 01:48:57.857]  I'd be surprised if Republicans don't take 45, 56, 57 states out of the 50, Laffer told the Cats Roundtable on New York's AM 970 Sunday.
[01:48:58.357 --> 01:49:02.679]  I mean, I think it's going to be a landslide, and that's what the evidence shows.
[01:49:02.719 --> 01:49:04.420]  He's made a lot of accurate predictions before.
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:06.081]  That's in the Hill newspaper.
[01:49:06.541 --> 01:49:07.442]  Now here's one in the U.S.
[01:49:07.502 --> 01:49:10.103]  News & World Report, a lot more scientific than his opinion.
[01:49:11.143 --> 01:49:12.324]  Trump could win it all.
[01:49:13.217 --> 01:49:20.998]  A new survey shows a sizable number of Democrats ready to defect from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump.
[01:49:21.019 --> 01:49:38.942]  20% in a Washington-based Mercury Analytics combination dial test of Trump's first big campaign, among 916 self-proclaimed likely voters who consider themselves to be on the fence, 20% of Democrats said they would be voting for Donald Trump.
[01:49:39.778 --> 01:49:41.858]  He gets 10% he wins, folks, the Democrats.
[01:49:42.499 --> 01:49:47.000]  Shot poll, here it is, 20% of likely Democrat voters to cross over to Trump.
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:47.900]  American Mirror.
[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:49.620]  There's a Breitbart article.
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:52.981]  Poll, Trump beats Hillary in general election matchup.
[01:49:53.781 --> 01:49:54.621]  Fox News poll.
[01:49:55.481 --> 01:49:58.622]  Little Vester Stallone comes out and says, quote, I love Trump.
[01:50:01.303 --> 01:50:08.064]  I didn't jump on the bandwagon for Obama, and I'm not jumping on the Donald Trump bandwagon, but at least he says he doesn't want to confiscate the guns.
[01:50:09.574 --> 01:50:16.699]  I don't like some of his comments about, I'm really militaristic, don't worry, I'm not a wimp, but I don't want to attack Russia or attack Iran.
[01:50:16.739 --> 01:50:19.921]  I mean, he says, basically, I don't want war, but don't worry, I'm tough.
[01:50:19.961 --> 01:50:22.663]  So I kind of buy into the rhetoric.
[01:50:23.083 --> 01:50:30.849]  Still, I know Hillary wants to go attack countries like Egypt, Syria, Libya that didn't attack us and then put horrible people in.
[01:50:31.389 --> 01:50:33.531]  So again, I know she's 10 times worse.
[01:50:33.871 --> 01:50:35.172]  I mean, let's just say Trump's bad.
[01:50:36.212 --> 01:50:36.913]  He's not Hillary.
[01:50:39.212 --> 01:50:40.913]  And the whole establishment is against him.
[01:50:40.953 --> 01:50:46.334]  That's why I've been, the last month or two, you know, saying, hey, I'd love a Rand Paul.
[01:50:46.454 --> 01:50:47.755]  I'd love a Ted Cruz.
[01:50:47.795 --> 01:50:50.396]  They're just not in the polls like a Donald Trump.
[01:50:52.256 --> 01:50:52.917]  It's just a fact.
[01:50:53.357 --> 01:50:55.517]  I've known Rand Paul 20 years.
[01:50:56.618 --> 01:50:57.678]  He just ended the position.
[01:50:58.999 --> 01:51:02.880]  And you got to dance with the horses in the lead if you're not going to support the other horses.
[01:51:04.414 --> 01:51:10.656]  Now, let's get to this story, and I'm going to roll some footage for TV viewers if they just, you know, tuned in the last few years and didn't know this.
[01:51:12.037 --> 01:51:17.299]  It was in the late 90s, and I got calls on my radio show, and there was no attention to it in the news.
[01:51:17.339 --> 01:51:19.279]  It wasn't even in the Dallas Morning News yet.
[01:51:19.319 --> 01:51:20.400]  It wasn't on national news.
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:25.541]  And the Gray family called me, and they said, we listen to your show every night.
[01:51:25.621 --> 01:51:26.662]  We need your help, Alex.
[01:51:28.199 --> 01:51:29.321]  My dad got arrested.
[01:51:29.381 --> 01:51:30.362]  It was his son calling.
[01:51:31.002 --> 01:51:31.623]  He called in.
[01:51:31.883 --> 01:51:33.465]  I'm going back 17, 18 years.
[01:51:33.505 --> 01:51:36.708]  It's hard to remember it all, but there's articles about it, videos about it.
[01:51:37.449 --> 01:51:41.032]  And they said, they pulled us over with a legal gun, took him to jail.
[01:51:41.052 --> 01:51:41.833]  They're charging him.
[01:51:42.594 --> 01:51:43.815]  We're having an armed standoff.
[01:51:43.915 --> 01:51:45.337]  They said they're going to raid us the next week.
[01:51:46.533 --> 01:52:01.806]  So I go out there and we find DPS cameras hidden and cattle trailers with SWAT teams ready to come in and I go in the night they're supposed to come in and, you know, all the rest of this happens and then Chuck Norris hears about it and he lands by helicopter to try to go in and talk him out.
[01:52:03.428 --> 01:52:09.893]  Well, 15 years after it started, it really started before that, but it became a big national story, it started about 16 years ago, about 99.
[01:52:14.329 --> 01:52:16.091]  They send in the, quote, militia.
[01:52:16.232 --> 01:52:17.774]  He's never been in the military.
[01:52:18.414 --> 01:52:19.576]  Same story out in Oregon.
[01:52:20.217 --> 01:52:22.780]  You know, we're talking the stolen valor story.
[01:52:23.621 --> 01:52:28.387]  And they show up and go, Alex Jones is a fed and gave out the intel on you.
[01:52:29.332 --> 01:52:37.254]  And then, of course, a man like John Joe Gray or whoever else, while there's guys around me in military uniforms telling me I'm the commander.
[01:52:37.274 --> 01:52:38.975]  That's right, man.
[01:52:39.055 --> 01:52:39.615]  I salute you.
[01:52:39.635 --> 01:52:44.296]  Of course, it's feds all around them or opposition that's controlled to make it look stupid.
[01:52:45.577 --> 01:52:48.257]  But the sheriff and others were smart, didn't want to do Waco.
[01:52:48.297 --> 01:52:49.398]  It's real close to Waco.
[01:52:49.878 --> 01:52:50.698]  And they didn't go in.
[01:52:52.605 --> 01:53:01.250]  For 15 years, and now they've dropped the charges, and it's in the Dallas Morning News, it's in a bunch of other newspapers, Daily Mail.
[01:53:01.691 --> 01:53:04.072]  Longest armed standoff in American history ends.
[01:53:04.653 --> 01:53:15.780]  Grandfather who bit a cop, that was when he tackled him, then threatened to kill any officer who came to arrest him, has charges dropped after 16 years, meaning he's free to leave his home for the first time since 99.
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:20.703]  And I don't think the Grays will probably leave their 40-something acres regardless.
[01:53:21.764 --> 01:53:23.906]  And, man, I've lived this over and over again.
[01:53:23.926 --> 01:53:25.487]  I think they're good people.
[01:53:25.547 --> 01:53:26.688]  I think they were misguided.
[01:53:27.068 --> 01:53:27.969]  They were manipulated.
[01:53:28.029 --> 01:53:30.070]  But, man, same deal.
[01:53:30.130 --> 01:53:32.312]  I sent Joe Biggs out to Oregon, where the Bundys are.
[01:53:32.632 --> 01:53:34.854]  I sent David Knight and others out there last year.
[01:53:35.234 --> 01:53:39.457]  Said they did the right thing standing up to the feds that had taken their cattle on their own grazing rights.
[01:53:39.497 --> 01:53:41.438]  They went back to take the cattle with protesters.
[01:53:41.959 --> 01:53:43.220]  The feds said, we're going to shoot you.
[01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:44.160]  They had to back off.
[01:53:44.501 --> 01:53:47.323]  We have HD video of that and historic footage.
[01:53:47.383 --> 01:53:48.644]  Feds surrender to citizens.
[01:53:49.284 --> 01:53:50.344]  Because they were in the right there.
[01:53:50.664 --> 01:53:58.307]  You go take some wildlife refuge building over, say you're going to be there, and then there's tweets about, we need snacks, we need supplies, because they're not ready.
[01:53:58.907 --> 01:54:02.708]  And then Joe Biggs goes in there, and almost all these militia guys aren't even former military.
[01:54:03.029 --> 01:54:03.849]  Some say they are.
[01:54:03.869 --> 01:54:04.809]  We're going to do a report on it.
[01:54:08.049 --> 01:54:10.290]  They immediately go, Alex Jones ain't welcome!
[01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:11.210]  He says we're feds!
[01:54:11.491 --> 01:54:12.191]  Never said that.
[01:54:12.251 --> 01:54:14.912]  I said look out for feds trying to provocate your violence.
[01:54:14.932 --> 01:54:15.812]  So it's the same story.
[01:54:16.393 --> 01:54:23.976]  We put the grays on the map, we show what's happening, we stop the armed takeover, people show up in uniforms and go, he's a fed!
[01:54:24.356 --> 01:54:25.177]  And they go, that's right!
[01:54:25.237 --> 01:54:25.997]  We salute that!
[01:54:26.817 --> 01:54:27.938]  And it's the same story.
[01:54:27.978 --> 01:54:34.401]  So, I don't think the feds are going to move in on the Bundys, and I think they've now got their new 15-year house.
[01:54:35.646 --> 01:54:42.111]  I mean, I hope that's what happens rather than a big shootout and Obama gets his new false flag and start a war against gun owners.
[01:54:42.691 --> 01:54:52.678]  And I get the Feds are grabbing property, I get they're tyrannical, I get they... But the Hammonds themselves, that the Bundys say they're helping, and I don't think the Bundys are Feds, I think they're misguided.
[01:54:53.859 --> 01:54:55.961]  They don't want this going on.
[01:54:56.041 --> 01:54:57.662]  And it's a federal building.
[01:54:58.162 --> 01:55:01.905]  It's not their own cows grabbed by the Feds on grazing rights they had since 1878.
[01:55:04.585 --> 01:55:09.347]  That's why even the older Bundy is saying he's not getting involved in this.
[01:55:12.068 --> 01:55:13.689]  It's just a big national story to say.
[01:55:13.709 --> 01:55:16.110]  I saw the CNN headline like an hour ago during a break.
[01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:17.330]  GUNMEN!
[01:55:17.630 --> 01:55:19.171]  MORE GUNMEN ARRIVE!
[01:55:19.251 --> 01:55:20.871]  And we have this headline here.
[01:55:20.891 --> 01:55:24.213]  IDAHO MILITIA GROUPS ARRIVES AS SECURE PERIMETER!
[01:55:25.026 --> 01:55:26.567]  Yeah, from the evil patriot media.
[01:55:27.547 --> 01:55:30.729]  Prevent Waco-style situation in Oregon Refuge.
[01:55:30.769 --> 01:55:32.490]  But I'll tell you the good news about all this.
[01:55:32.830 --> 01:55:34.831]  And I do respect the courage of people like the Bundys.
[01:55:37.693 --> 01:55:41.035]  It does show the feds aren't ready for a toe-to-toe fight with the American people.
[01:55:41.055 --> 01:55:42.655]  They try mass gun confiscation.
[01:55:43.036 --> 01:55:44.216]  They try mass arrest.
[01:55:45.577 --> 01:55:46.998]  They try to declare martial law.
[01:55:49.209 --> 01:55:50.670]  People are going to stand up against him.
[01:55:51.150 --> 01:56:03.014]  I just don't want to hand the system the optics, the visual, that makes gunners look like we're on the offense taking over things.
[01:56:03.454 --> 01:56:06.155]  Because that's how it's being misrepresented to the dumbbells.
[01:56:06.875 --> 01:56:13.718]  And I just don't think it's the high ground position like it was with what the Bundys and my reporters were there right at the front lines.
[01:56:13.758 --> 01:56:17.279]  David Knight and Josh Owens supporting it, marching right through.
[01:56:18.885 --> 01:56:22.148]  When the Feds were saying, we're going to shoot you, but the Patriots didn't name guns.
[01:56:22.188 --> 01:56:23.249]  They didn't say we have a perimeter.
[01:56:23.269 --> 01:56:25.251]  They said, we're marching through your perimeter.
[01:56:25.671 --> 01:56:26.872]  And the Feds had to back down.
[01:56:27.793 --> 01:56:32.538]  And man, there were those voices there saying, get rid of them full wars reporters, they're Feds.
[01:56:33.277 --> 01:56:36.838]  And of course those were obviously you-know-who trying to divide and conquer people.
[01:56:37.298 --> 01:56:38.279]  I'm a citizen.
[01:56:38.339 --> 01:56:39.559]  I have a right to my opinion.
[01:56:39.579 --> 01:56:42.180]  This is not the best time and best place for this to happen.
[01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:44.141]  And I'm not saying the bunnies are feds.
[01:56:44.181 --> 01:56:44.901]  I don't think they are.
[01:56:45.802 --> 01:56:57.826]  I just think that this is going down a bad road and a lot of smarter feds on the ground know that the Obama people have said they want a big armed confrontation to try to kick off a civil war, but the feds themselves are saying we're not going to do anything.
[01:56:58.786 --> 01:57:05.091]  And so it'll turn into a big competition for the folks inside that federal barn they've taken over asking for snacks.
[01:57:05.151 --> 01:57:06.492]  I mean, you go, they're begging for food.
[01:57:10.202 --> 01:57:12.504]  Last time I heard, that's what folks do on the side of the road.
[01:57:13.545 --> 01:57:18.429]  So, that's where I stand in all of this, and I don't want to kick something physical off right now.
[01:57:18.529 --> 01:57:23.233]  We're making major inroads, waking up the feds across the board, waking up others.
[01:57:23.293 --> 01:57:26.716]  We don't want to give the globalists the civil war they want.
[01:57:26.836 --> 01:57:29.879]  In closing, I'll cover it tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:57:29.939 --> 01:57:31.901]  Central, when the big weekday show kicks off.
[01:57:32.681 --> 01:57:36.484]  Here's what Sean Penn agreed to do to party with El Chapo.
[01:57:37.225 --> 01:57:40.547]  They're talking about charging Sean Penn with working with this drug-dealing terrorist.
[01:57:41.587 --> 01:57:53.614]  This drug-dealing terrorist, it came out in mainstream articles, Business Insider, El Paso, Times, Chicago Tribune, that their CIA running the drugs into America and the CIA turned on them.
[01:57:53.874 --> 01:57:55.234]  That came out in federal court.
[01:57:55.515 --> 01:57:58.036]  So leave the gun-grabbing dumbass Sean Penn alone.
[01:57:58.735 --> 01:58:01.940]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:58:02.241 --> 01:58:07.910]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimal
