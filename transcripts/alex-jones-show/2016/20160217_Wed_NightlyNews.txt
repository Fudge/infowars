[00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:21.607]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.707 --> 00:00:22.969]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.211]  It is February 17, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:30.748 --> 00:00:36.493]  Tonight, the knockout game is back, and this time the target is U.S.
[00:00:36.554 --> 00:00:37.094]  veterans.
[00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:54.591]  A highly decorated war hero, whose bravery was immortalized in this statue, was beaten and robbed by a cowardly group of racist black teens after they ambushed him outside of a McDonald's and asked him if black lives matter.
[00:00:55.171 --> 00:01:05.840]  Then, InfoWars reporters infiltrate the Cibolo Creek Ranch to illustrate the mass media blackout of the mysterious death of Justice Scalia.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.902]  This is a story of national importance.
[00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:11.665]  There's a lot of people who are very concerned that procedures were not followed.
[00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:15.147]  And they want to know who was making that decision.
[00:01:15.168 --> 00:01:16.969]  Was that something the sheriff was doing?
[00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:18.811]  Or was that something the federal marshals were doing?
[00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:19.771]  Is it something you were doing?
[00:01:20.152 --> 00:01:23.955]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:01.624]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.206]  You can't survive without it.
[00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.308]  But where do you get it?
[00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:10.375]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:16.302]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:33.360]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.882]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:36.242 --> 00:02:37.443]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:38.503]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:38.744 --> 00:02:39.364]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:39.664 --> 00:02:41.486]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:11.091]  We've seen a lot of controversy surrounding the death of Justice Scalia, and now there's just as much controversy concerning who his replacement is going to be.
[00:03:11.451 --> 00:03:13.153]  And with more on this, we have Leanne McAdoo.
[00:03:13.313 --> 00:03:13.574]  Leanne?
[00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.969]  That's right, Jakari.
[00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:23.134]  This is certainly going to be a very hot, key issue to pay attention to with this election cycle, and of course they're going to heavily politicize this.
[00:03:23.554 --> 00:03:27.477]  Now yesterday, President Obama came out finger-wagging once again to Congress.
[00:03:27.517 --> 00:03:34.841]  He says, I intend to do my job and nominate a qualified Supreme Court candidate, giving us his word that he's going to
[00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:36.983]  Put in the best person for the job.
[00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:45.934]  But he went on to challenge his political foes in the Senate to rise above the venom and rancor that has paralyzed judicial nominations.
[00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:50.840]  Ah, much like the venom and rancor that he exhibited in 2006.
[00:03:50.881 --> 00:03:51.301]  Obama now regrets
[00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:54.645]  Yes.
[00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:31.408]  Justice Scalia was he was someone who would take the Constitution on its original interpretation.
[00:04:31.848 --> 00:04:38.330]  And now, of course, we're in a position where President Obama is going to play this three three different ways, possibly.
[00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.093]  So if the Republicans say that there's no way they're going to hold any hearings, then he could play dirty and he could do
[00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:47.714]  Play some sort of a move that makes the Republicans look bad.
[00:04:47.794 --> 00:04:53.275]  We have a lot of Republicans who are up in some swing states that could lose their seats to Democrats.
[00:04:53.395 --> 00:04:54.635]  So he might play it like that.
[00:04:55.315 --> 00:05:05.577]  But if Republicans indicate that they will hold some hearings, then he's going to have a greater reason to name a consensus candidate, someone that the Republicans will have a really hard time rejecting.
[00:05:06.237 --> 00:05:08.618]  And now this is coming out of the Washington Post.
[00:05:08.678 --> 00:05:12.859]  President Obama's three strategy options for his Supreme Court pick.
[00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:21.164]  And of course he can pick the best person for the job, which is Obama's definition of the best person for the job.
[00:05:21.724 --> 00:05:28.868]  That's going to be someone who will vote to overturn Citizens United, which opened the floodgates for money in politics.
[00:05:29.308 --> 00:05:29.789]  Someone who
[00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:40.215]  Doesn't think that the President overstepped his constitutional bounds in expanding deportation relief for illegal immigrants, and of course, someone who shares his pro-choice views.
[00:05:40.815 --> 00:05:43.977]  And of course, this is not likely to get confirmed by the Republicans.
[00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:53.083]  Then of course, they could also make a compromise, finding someone who neither the Republicans or Democrats really like very much, but someone they can all agree to live with.
[00:05:53.863 --> 00:05:58.847]  And like I mentioned earlier, they could choose the best person to give Democrats back the Senate.
[00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:04.391]  So this would be someone who would be very polarizing, but who would rally the Democratic base.
[00:06:04.992 --> 00:06:14.379]  And so that's probably what we're going to be seeing a lot here is just trying to rally around that Democratic base to get them to lose their seats in a lot of these key states.
[00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:16.241]  There are Republicans are defending 24 of the 34 seats in 2016.
[00:06:19.423 --> 00:06:21.264]  So that's definitely something to watch for.
[00:06:21.764 --> 00:06:23.325]  Like I said, it'll remain a key issue.
[00:06:23.725 --> 00:06:26.387]  But whatever way this happens, the stakes are high.
[00:06:26.407 --> 00:06:28.307]  Yeah, that's the thing about it.
[00:06:28.327 --> 00:06:29.648]  It says, let's work together.
[00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:31.489]  Let's get rid of all this venom and hatred.
[00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.471]  And by getting rid of it, he means just vote for anybody I say should be the nominee.
[00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:36.992]  Thank you so much, Leanne McAdoo.
[00:06:37.526 --> 00:06:44.190]  Now in the latest episode of the feud between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, Ted Cruz is saying go ahead and sue me.
[00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.954]  He's going to continue running an ad talking about Donald Trump's views on abortion, or at least his previous views.
[00:06:51.715 --> 00:07:02.241]  Ted Cruz made an ad where he showed a video of Donald Trump on live television many years ago talking about how he was pro-choice, he believes it's a woman's right to choose whatever she wants to do.
[00:07:04.102 --> 00:07:06.465]  When this ad came out, Mr. Trump was very upset.
[00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:09.609]  And to be fair, he did say things that Ted Cruz accused him of.
[00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:14.374]  So we'll see who comes out on top as these guys continue to go at it on the debate stage.
[00:07:14.795 --> 00:07:17.898]  Now, let's talk about getting on top in your finances.
[00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.380]  We see a war on cash.
[00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:24.026]  Now, if you choose to use credit cards, bitcoins, online purchases, whatever, that's your business.
[00:07:24.426 --> 00:07:29.669]  But I don't think we should live in a cashless society just for the simple fact that, in my opinion, it's convenient.
[00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:32.751]  Also, you don't have everybody tracking everything that you do.
[00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:34.312]  But now we see Larry Summers.
[00:07:34.352 --> 00:07:36.313]  He wants to kill the $100 bill.
[00:07:36.853 --> 00:07:40.856]  And Mr. Summers is an economist and former chief of the World Bank.
[00:07:41.296 --> 00:07:43.677]  And he's eyeing a position in the Federal Reserve.
[00:07:44.038 --> 00:07:46.619]  He's saying, basically, we need to get rid of $100 bills.
[00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:49.741]  And also, he wouldn't be opposed to getting rid of 50s.
[00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:51.582]  Thus is my understanding.
[00:07:51.662 --> 00:07:52.623]  And we've previously seen
[00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:58.545]  Cash banned in places like Louisiana, where they say if you want to have a garage sale, you can't do it with a cash currency.
[00:07:58.585 --> 00:08:02.847]  You have to do it in a way that could be infinitely tracked by the government.
[00:08:02.867 --> 00:08:04.207]  That's the thing about garage sales.
[00:08:04.588 --> 00:08:09.069]  The government even wants you to get a little license to go sell lemonade on the side of the street.
[00:08:09.369 --> 00:08:10.550]  They always have to get their cut.
[00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:16.634]  Now, this isn't the most hard-hitting news of the day, but I think it is important because it is a sign of the times.
[00:08:17.294 --> 00:08:21.277]  A woman is sent to jail for drunk driving on Periscope.
[00:08:21.898 --> 00:08:29.283]  And it's very difficult for me to comprehend why people have to put every moment of their lives on the internet.
[00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.904]  And she says, let's have fun, let's have fun.
[00:08:32.425 --> 00:08:35.967]  I'm drunk on South Florida Avenue because I'm a drunk person.
[00:08:35.987 --> 00:08:36.588]  This is a quote.
[00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:39.230]  57 people talking about her viewers.
[00:08:39.611 --> 00:08:40.792]  I didn't know I could get this many.
[00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:44.275]  I am super drunk in the USA and the light is red.
[00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:45.337]  And it goes on from there.
[00:08:45.917 --> 00:08:49.301]  Basically, she was arrested for her activities.
[00:08:50.982 --> 00:08:51.823]  I guess she cut some deals.
[00:08:51.843 --> 00:08:53.445]  She's not going to serve any time in jail.
[00:08:53.765 --> 00:08:56.488]  But it reminded me of another story that happened many years ago.
[00:08:56.728 --> 00:08:58.170]  This girl said, I robbed a bank.
[00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.012]  Basically, she robbed a bank.
[00:09:01.115 --> 00:09:06.439]  And then filmed herself on YouTube with the instruments of the crime.
[00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:08.120]  She said she stole a car.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.242]  She had the car keys saying, hey, I stole this car.
[00:09:10.802 --> 00:09:12.604]  She had the cash from the bank robbery.
[00:09:13.044 --> 00:09:26.374]  And it's just like, I don't know if you can call it a mental illness, but it's just so ingrained in people, and it's not even the young people, it's just people in general, that they have to document every moment of their lives and put it on YouTube.
[00:09:27.254 --> 00:09:32.479]  Uh, and if you want to do that with your criminal activity, you're probably going to get thrown in jail.
[00:09:32.499 --> 00:09:37.263]  I mean, I really don't know what else to say about it.
[00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:44.449]  And in another sign of the times, let's talk about some of the activist groups, these social justice warriors, as I've heard them referred to.
[00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:53.775]  Now, if you go out in the streets and you peacefully protest, you want to go talk to your, you know, police chief or whoever talking about your redress of grievances, I think that's fine.
[00:09:53.815 --> 00:09:54.255]  That's great.
[00:09:54.295 --> 00:09:55.015]  That's wonderful.
[00:09:55.336 --> 00:10:02.320]  But when it comes to the point where you're harassing just random people on the street, that's when you got to really step back and look at what you're doing.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.922]  And I understand not everybody's doing that, but you have some very
[00:10:05.402 --> 00:10:05.883]  We're good to go.
[00:10:21.261 --> 00:10:24.784]  He was approached by a group supposedly affiliated with Black Lives Matter.
[00:10:25.084 --> 00:10:26.986]  They said, hey, do you think Black Lives Matter?
[00:10:27.006 --> 00:10:29.888]  He was just trying to enjoy his meal, minding his own business.
[00:10:29.908 --> 00:10:30.369]  He left.
[00:10:30.789 --> 00:10:36.173]  The restaurant was attacked, ambushed, and basically hit in the head with a firearm, which knocked him unconscious.
[00:10:36.473 --> 00:10:39.276]  They stole his wallet and ripped his clothing.
[00:10:39.816 --> 00:10:44.803]  And they didn't use the proceeds of the Man's Pockets to go out and fight the injustices of the world.
[00:10:45.104 --> 00:10:46.506]  They went out and bought liquor.
[00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.530]  So it's just one of the things that's going on out there.
[00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.154]  Like I said, it makes the entire movement look bad.
[00:10:52.715 --> 00:10:55.900]  I really wish that people would speak out about this type of thing because it definitely needs to stop.
[00:10:56.909 --> 00:10:59.450]  Now, let's talk about Apple and the technology state.
[00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:11.394]  Apple have previously said that they're not going to open phones for police officers and they're sticking to their guns, as is the case with a shooting in San Bernardino that happened here recently.
[00:11:11.814 --> 00:11:13.975]  And I do respect them for sticking to their guns on this.
[00:11:14.095 --> 00:11:23.878]  You know, you can make the case that this is a terrorism case and they should make an exemption, but Tim Cook is saying, hey, I said from the onset I'm not going to open back doors for police officers and I'm sticking to that.
[00:11:24.398 --> 00:11:26.321]  I can respect the man for that.
[00:11:26.682 --> 00:11:29.045]  Just saying that he wants everybody to have their privacy.
[00:11:29.386 --> 00:11:32.871]  Because there's enough evidence to convict the San Bernardino shooters in general.
[00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:35.956]  They may have had ties to other groups, and I guess that's what they want to find out.
[00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:39.841]  But Tim Cook's sticking to that, so that's probably the one good thing I can actually say about the guy.
[00:11:40.382 --> 00:11:51.450]  And the good things stop right there, because I'm talking about this pedophile who is leading a child sex ring in England, and now he's saying that he wants to use human rights laws to block his deportation.
[00:11:52.030 --> 00:12:02.017]  And this is the type of guy that really gets on my nerves, because we talk about illegal immigration and all these things, and now he's saying that he's being scapegoated as a Muslim citizen.
[00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:09.299]  For these heinous actions that he committed, and he's saying they're basically coming after him because he's a Muslim, and that's the only reason why they want to deport him.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.321]  No, they want to deport you because you're having sex with minors.
[00:12:13.701 --> 00:12:22.384]  He was sentenced to 19 years for a string of sexual offenses, including rape, and also 22 years for 30 charges of rape against another victim.
[00:12:22.444 --> 00:12:24.725]  I definitely think this is the type of guy who needs to be deported.
[00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:29.867]  I think violent, convicted felons are open game for deportation.
[00:12:30.447 --> 00:12:37.272]  And from the street level Skoma Society to the top tier, we have a special report from John Bowne documenting this year's Davos Conference.
[00:12:38.573 --> 00:12:54.144]  Following the 2016 Davos Confab, a meeting of 62 people, as wealthy as the 3.6 billion poorest half of the world's population, where a major theme was the future of automation as it replaces working humans.
[00:12:54.444 --> 00:13:01.611]  As more and more of the population leaves the workplace, economic growth enters a period of secular stagnation.
[00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:12.941]  Economist and potential future Federal Reserve Chairman Larry Summers is heralding these conditions as the perfect storm needed to transition to a cashless society.
[00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:14.703]  Paul Joseph Watson writes,
[00:13:15.183 --> 00:13:23.408]  Summers has called for the $100 bill to be phased out of circulation, becoming the latest prominent voice to advocate the elimination of cash.
[00:13:23.668 --> 00:13:37.337]  The Washington Post writes, Summers calls for a moratorium on printing new, high-denomination notes in the name of stopping crime and corruption, a global agreement to stop issuing notes worth more than, say, $50 or $100.
[00:13:38.498 --> 00:13:42.320]  The inevitable mark of the beast system is fully underway.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:49.422]  France introduced laws last year which restricted French citizens from making cash payments over 1,000 euros.
[00:13:49.782 --> 00:13:56.904]  Italy, Russia, Spain, Mexico and Uruguay have all introduced similar laws that ban cash payments over a certain amount.
[00:13:57.024 --> 00:14:11.128]  Earlier this week, the ECB Council voted to scrap the 500 euro bill, a decision that would reduce the amount of physical cash in circulation by around 30%, despite the fact that such a move would be negative for the currency.
[00:14:11.288 --> 00:14:13.710]  According to a Bank of America analysis.
[00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:22.915]  Last month, Norway's biggest bank, DNB, called for eliminating cash to cut down on black market sales and crimes such as money laundering.
[00:14:23.135 --> 00:14:34.883]  In August of 2015, the Financial Times published an editorial which called for the abolition of cash altogether to make life easier for a government set on squeezing the informal economy out of existence.
[00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.705]  We should move towards an international currency.
[00:14:38.365 --> 00:14:49.128]  Because the speculation and the complexity of currency has caused some of the irritation, not only among the trading nations, but among individuals.
[00:14:49.529 --> 00:15:00.332]  At a secretive meeting in London last year, Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University and William Buter, the chief economists at Citigroup, met with the top central bankers to discuss phasing out cash.
[00:15:00.672 --> 00:15:20.963]  Former Bank of England economist Jim Leavis penned an article for London Telegraph last April in which he said a cashless society would only be achieved by forcing everyone to spend only by electronic means from an account held at a government-run bank, which would be monitored or even directly controlled by the government.
[00:15:21.023 --> 00:15:28.187]  The ultra-powerful Bilderberg Group also discussed the agenda to ban cash during its 2015 CONFAB in Austria.
[00:15:28.487 --> 00:15:31.688]  A conference attended by numerous prominent bankers.
[00:15:31.948 --> 00:15:41.371]  Basically, we are leaving the era of a strong global economy, brought to a screeching halt by the billionaires that reaped its benefits.
[00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:49.554]  Now that small elite plans to govern us all from their ivory tower, promising socialism as some kind of reward.
[00:15:49.774 --> 00:15:51.894]  Keep Obama in president, you know!
[00:15:52.355 --> 00:15:53.335]  He gave us a phone!
[00:15:53.635 --> 00:16:09.303]  Meanwhile, major banks are preparing for a bank holiday that could come at any moment as the final maelstrom begins between the cashless society of the corporatocracy running our kidnapped government versus the defenders of our dying federal republic.
[00:16:09.503 --> 00:16:10.624]  Right on, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:16:10.644 --> 00:16:11.344]  Another high five!
[00:16:12.164 --> 00:16:12.645]  Patriot!
[00:16:12.885 --> 00:16:14.606]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:16:15.626 --> 00:16:17.547]  And another excellent report from John Bound.
[00:16:17.627 --> 00:16:23.050]  Now we don't just have great reporters and video editors, we also have great graphics guys who make us stuff like this.
[00:16:23.371 --> 00:16:25.092]  The new Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:29.274]  It has the Joker motif and Hillary for Prison and Beyond on the back.
[00:16:29.294 --> 00:16:31.836]  This is another one of the great products you can get.
[00:16:31.856 --> 00:16:38.880]  It's very easy to start up a conversation when you have this thing on, but just be aware that not everybody may share your point of view.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:50.170]  Now, as we continue talking about this political talk, we have our roving reporter Richard Reeves, who's out in South Carolina, and he's going to bring us an update on the situation out there and everything you need to know about the candidates.
[00:16:51.391 --> 00:17:00.460]  Richard Reeves with Infowars.com here in Charleston, South Carolina, where we're bringing you right now a Hillary and Bernie update.
[00:17:01.226 --> 00:17:21.152]  This morning on the news it was widely broadcast that Hillary is going to be teaming up at an event here upcoming very soon with the mother of Sandra Bland, one of the folks that has been, well, that has mysteriously died, let's just leave it at that, mysteriously died while in police custody in the state of Texas.
[00:17:22.113 --> 00:17:25.214]  And when I saw that this morning I'm thinking, wow!
[00:17:25.993 --> 00:17:40.183]  Hillary, you have not really cared about any African Americans, at least not that many that I'm aware of, other than maybe Barack Obama, and it's just really strange to see her trying to shore up her vote
[00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:49.960]  With the African American community by actually reaching out to the Black Lives Matter crowd and bringing in Sandra Bland's mom for an event.
[00:17:50.561 --> 00:17:53.603]  And I just think that African Americans are not going to accept that.
[00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:59.006]  I think potentially this has a huge potential for backfiring on Hillary.
[00:17:59.486 --> 00:18:10.454]  So it's really a surprise that, you know, here in the midst of this heated race running for presidential election, numbers falling, polls falling, Nevada potentially going to Bernie.
[00:18:11.054 --> 00:18:28.325]  South Carolina flip a coin maybe who knows we don't know yet here in South Carolina the polls are showing Hillary with good lead but that could change here in the next week or so so it's going to be very interesting to see how Hillary totally photo-opping this situation with Sandra Bland's mom
[00:18:28.985 --> 00:18:32.487]  Will the African-American community buy it, hook, line, and sinker?
[00:18:33.027 --> 00:18:39.150]  Or will they finally see, hey, we are being used as pawns in this presidential election race.
[00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.611]  Pawns by Queen Hillary.
[00:18:42.792 --> 00:18:43.832]  I'm running for president.
[00:18:44.232 --> 00:18:47.414]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[00:18:47.694 --> 00:18:51.836]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[00:19:10.766 --> 00:19:12.068]  We believe in win-win, folks.
[00:19:12.128 --> 00:19:13.869]  Treating people like we want to be treated.
[00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.634]  That's why we developed IntraCeuticals with Dr. Group and other top researchers, chemists, scientists, you name it.
[00:19:18.794 --> 00:19:19.735]  He's one of our advisors.
[00:19:20.016 --> 00:19:25.481]  To come up with products like AnthroPlex that is an original product that he made just for us.
[00:19:26.422 --> 00:19:28.384]  And this is a base
[00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:34.120]  system to make super male or super female vitality work even better.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.180]  It is natural.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.482]  It just helps get your body pumping and going in the way you need to be going.
[00:19:40.882 --> 00:19:54.566]  And Dr. Group is here until we go to break to tell us about the latest product at InfoWarsLife.com, AnthroPlex, that out of the gates, and we do this all the time with the new product, we discount it out of the gates to get you to try it, knowing that you're going to love it.
[00:19:55.566 --> 00:19:56.187]  It'll sell out.
[00:19:56.527 --> 00:20:07.295]  So, Infowarslife.com, Anthroplex, 15% off and free shipping for the next two days only when you get it with Supermail or Female Vitality.
[00:20:07.435 --> 00:20:08.215]  Let's go to Dr. Group.
[00:20:08.396 --> 00:20:14.240]  Why do you call this the foundation to start the fire and then the Supermail takes you to the next level?
[00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:32.302]  Well, we just look at the base problem that's going on right now all over the world, which is the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the amount of estrogen that men have, the femininity of men, and what's going on even in children right now with low testosterone levels.
[00:20:32.782 --> 00:20:33.443]  We're good to go!
[00:21:00.939 --> 00:21:02.800]  What is in the goat weed?
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.301]  You've got one of the purest, strongest organic forms of it.
[00:21:05.361 --> 00:21:06.922]  What's so magic about the goat weed?
[00:21:20.228 --> 00:21:33.334]  Well, the horny goat weed was given that name because years ago in India, they noticed that a certain time of the year, this weed would grow and the goats would eat it and they would just go crazy with all the female goats.
[00:21:33.394 --> 00:21:34.915]  So that's how it was developed.
[00:21:34.955 --> 00:21:35.896]  It's called epimidium.
[00:21:36.696 --> 00:21:43.400]  And what that's been proven to do over thousands of years is increase sexual pleasure, help balance the male hormones.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.181]  It can actually be used for women as well.
[00:21:45.621 --> 00:21:52.485]  But it really kind of resets and brings the hormone balance, improves sperm motility, and increases testosterone levels.
[00:21:52.505 --> 00:21:54.506]  So it counters the stuff they've been throwing at us.
[00:21:54.766 --> 00:21:55.866]  Results will vary.
[00:21:55.946 --> 00:21:58.588]  Overall, all I know is dynamite.
[00:21:59.028 --> 00:22:03.894]  I mean, absolutely dynamite with the stamina, with the weight lifting, with the swimming.
[00:22:04.134 --> 00:22:09.140]  Folks, the new product is available, AnthroPlex, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.642]  Dr. Group, thank you for developing this amazing product.
[00:22:11.783 --> 00:22:12.083]  Thank you.
[00:23:05.017 --> 00:23:09.378]  A recent headline on the Drudge Report reads, Europe on the brink of new refugee swarm.
[00:23:09.818 --> 00:23:15.660]  Which links back to a Washington Post article, spring could bring a fresh surge of refugees, but Europe isn't ready for them.
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:25.862]  Last week, February 10th, 2016, George Soros wrote an opinion piece for the website ProjectSyndicate.com, flatly blaming Vladimir Putin for the refugee crisis across Europe.
[00:23:25.982 --> 00:23:32.724]  Soros wrote, Putin's current aim is to foster the EU's disintegration, and the best way to do so is flood the EU with Syrian refugees.
[00:23:33.084 --> 00:23:42.794]  Ironically enough, prior to this statement, Soros had been one of the most outspoken advocates for nations across Europe to help with the Middle East crisis, by creating a stable plan for accepting refugees into their societies.
[00:23:43.294 --> 00:23:46.778]  Now let's review a few key statements leading up to Soros' remarks last week.
[00:23:47.118 --> 00:23:53.244]  In September of 2015, months before the Russian action against ISIS, Soros posted this article on ProjectSyndicate.com.
[00:23:53.524 --> 00:23:55.005]  Rebuilding the asylum system.
[00:23:55.206 --> 00:23:58.588]  He actually says the EU needs a comprehensive plan to respond to the crisis.
[00:23:58.909 --> 00:24:07.756]  One that reasserts effective governance over the flows of asylum seekers so that they can take place in a safe, orderly way and a pace that reflects Europe's capacity to absorb them.
[00:24:07.997 --> 00:24:19.987]  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban responded to Soros' statement in October by accusing him of using the migrants as mere pawns for, quote, well-organized money movers, those thinking beyond nation-states and leaders who have never been elected.
[00:24:20.407 --> 00:24:22.229]  Europe has been betrayed, Orban continued.
[00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:26.332]  If we don't stand up for it, the continent will no longer be for those citizens living here.
[00:24:26.672 --> 00:24:30.395]  Then in mid-November 2015, Putin launched his offensive against ISIS.
[00:24:30.675 --> 00:24:35.939]  It appears that Soros completely changed his position, blaming the refugee crisis entirely on the Russian military action.
[00:24:36.319 --> 00:24:38.041]  Which of course makes no chronological sense.
[00:24:38.561 --> 00:24:48.429]  There certainly is a lot of finger pointing over what appears to be who is at fault for carrying out the agenda to move a third world refugee population into Europe to permanently alter European life as we know it.
[00:24:48.749 --> 00:24:55.934]  If we draw a line back to Count Richard Cotenhebb Kalergi, known for being the founder of the first popular United Europe movement, the Pan-Europa Movement.
[00:24:56.114 --> 00:24:59.017]  Kalergi called for a united Europe to counter a growing Russian threat.
[00:24:59.197 --> 00:25:03.560]  His vision was a United States of Europe which would eventually expand into a complete world order.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.360]  We're good to go!
[00:25:29.466 --> 00:25:33.148]  Interestingly enough, Soros remains a supporter and activist for the European Union.
[00:25:33.308 --> 00:25:39.312]  He recently warned that German austerity policies, which he originally pushed for, will be ultimately responsible for an EU failure.
[00:25:39.772 --> 00:25:47.236]  So as we see the refugee crisis escalate throughout Europe, we can also draw parallels from history, which present a clearer explanation for the present situation.
[00:25:47.516 --> 00:25:50.698]  Soros is simply carrying forward the progressive agenda of his forerunner.
[00:25:50.898 --> 00:25:57.102]  The plan for a united Europe has always included an agenda for what Calergi described as the Eurasian-Negroid race of the future.
[00:25:57.722 --> 00:26:04.468]  Many experts have already warned that the refugee crisis threatens to bring European culture to its knees if the situation is not brought under control soon.
[00:26:04.848 --> 00:26:08.031]  The end of some, however, represents the beginning of a new world order.
[00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:11.994]  As the winter ice thaws, will we see a new surge in the clergy plan?
[00:26:12.274 --> 00:26:15.577]  Or will the nation-states of Europe begin to control their own borders?
[00:26:15.937 --> 00:26:18.519]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:30.051]  I am excited to have Max Keiser and his guest with us today via video Skype.
[00:26:30.071 --> 00:26:33.592]  And it's better if Max introduces his guest.
[00:26:33.632 --> 00:26:39.033]  He's an internet freedom, free speech activist and a TV host and has been a model.
[00:26:39.733 --> 00:26:42.954]  And we're going to get into all that in the balance of the hour.
[00:26:43.174 --> 00:26:46.955]  We're also going to get into Larry Summers launches the war on paper money.
[00:26:47.496 --> 00:26:50.036]  Says it's time to kill the $100 bill, the head of the European Central Bank.
[00:26:50.296 --> 00:26:52.397]  Says get rid of the 500 note and then on down.
[00:26:52.757 --> 00:26:54.238]  Why do they want to get rid of cash?
[00:26:54.959 --> 00:26:56.300]  Well, that's a very, very important point.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.061]  And why are they saying it now?
[00:26:58.462 --> 00:27:08.510]  So there's so much to discuss with what's happening in the world economy as well as that unravels, as Max Keiser has predicted, and so much more.
[00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:09.911]  We've got the death of the mainstream media.
[00:27:10.051 --> 00:27:10.752]  We'll be looking at that.
[00:27:11.352 --> 00:27:14.095]  So, Max, it's usually you and Stacy we have on.
[00:27:14.355 --> 00:27:16.497]  We just had you on two weeks ago from Red Square.
[00:27:17.418 --> 00:27:18.380]  They're at the Kremlin.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.662]  Amazing interview.
[00:27:19.682 --> 00:27:20.704]  A news-making interview.
[00:27:20.724 --> 00:27:22.668]  A lot of key intel you broke down.
[00:27:23.209 --> 00:27:25.253]  Tell us where you are now in the world and who you're with.
[00:27:26.383 --> 00:27:28.704]  Right, Alex Jones, great to be back with you.
[00:27:29.084 --> 00:27:32.445]  Yeah, you know, I tried to check in with you on our travels.
[00:27:32.465 --> 00:27:38.347]  You know, I checked in with you in Athens, in Cairo, in Moscow, now we're in Amsterdam.
[00:27:38.887 --> 00:27:51.232]  And I met Ansela, who is a really interesting voice for the alternative media and for some of the views that are not being picked up.
[00:27:52.032 --> 00:27:55.858]  By the mainstream Netherlands press, the Dutch press.
[00:27:56.138 --> 00:28:00.725]  Which is, like many of these big countries, it's become very conservative.
[00:28:01.386 --> 00:28:06.253]  And when I travel, and I know you find the same thing when you travel, you find pockets of resistance.
[00:28:07.034 --> 00:28:10.675]  So, I would say Ansela is leading up a pocket of resistance.
[00:28:10.695 --> 00:28:21.418]  She's also very involved in the Dutch Pirate Party, which is a very important political wave that's sweeping Europe and in Iceland.
[00:28:21.438 --> 00:28:30.501]  You've had Brigitte Jones-Dotz here on your show, Alex, the MP from Iceland, who's championing the Pirate Party in Iceland.
[00:28:30.521 --> 00:28:36.503]  And the Iceland Pirate Party has many seats in Parliament, and they're in contention for running Iceland.
[00:28:37.043 --> 00:28:44.246]  So, Ansela is a part of the Pirate Party here in the Netherlands, and a couple of stories I think we can kind of dig into.
[00:28:44.266 --> 00:28:57.372]  The first story, and I'll turn it over to Ansela, but this idea of Apple Computer resisting the FBI is a fantastic story, because the history of the Netherlands, Alex, if you go back to World War II,
[00:28:58.152 --> 00:29:08.875]  When all the data was centralized by the government, it was very easy when the Nazis came to get that data from the government, round up the Jews, and send them off to concentration camps.
[00:29:08.896 --> 00:29:11.576]  Sure, that's like a gun registration is always used for confiscation.
[00:29:12.377 --> 00:29:12.857]  Exactly.
[00:29:13.057 --> 00:29:21.660]  So, with this, I'll kind of turn it over to Ansela for a moment to kind of speak a little bit about, you know, what are your thoughts, Ansela, in this kind of three-way conversation?
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.480]  Hi, Alex.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.040]  Hey, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:25.521]  Thank you for having me.
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:32.164]  What's your thoughts on this Apple news, on the FBI, and how is it playing here in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands?
[00:29:32.204 --> 00:29:33.745]  How does it fit in?
[00:29:33.885 --> 00:29:39.169]  Well, obviously we also have Apple products in the Netherlands, so I guess that affects us as well.
[00:29:40.489 --> 00:29:49.115]  Yeah, I'm really interested in what Apple has been doing in the past couple of... I guess since Tim Cook has arrived.
[00:29:49.856 --> 00:29:54.559]  He's publicly said that he really values privacy, and at first I was a little skeptical.
[00:29:54.639 --> 00:29:56.020]  I was like, yeah, you're just saying that?
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:06.564]  But now it's actually looking like they're starting to realize that their profit is in trustworthy products, not actual data.
[00:30:06.584 --> 00:30:12.667]  They're taking the side of the user, and you made an interesting point before, that Apple actually makes the products like
[00:30:12.947 --> 00:30:19.050]  Hardware, whereas Google and Facebook are more service-oriented and have a slightly different business model.
[00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:33.578]  For me what Apple's really saying, and I want both your takes on this, is it ruins our platform to put back doors in it that all the bad guys, including government bad guys, corporate bad guys, individual bad guys, it's like all these smart homes are getting constantly taken over and hacked.
[00:30:33.878 --> 00:30:35.539]  They don't work, it's crud.
[00:30:35.899 --> 00:30:38.801]  You build back doors in something, it's not a house, it's a cave.
[00:30:40.031 --> 00:30:45.176]  Yeah, you can't say, well, we're putting in a backdoor, but only this type of person can come in.
[00:30:45.336 --> 00:30:46.577]  Only the government can come in.
[00:30:46.637 --> 00:30:50.280]  No, you're building backdoors and people are going to enter that backdoor, obviously.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:58.647]  Well, Angela, here in the Netherlands, there's tremendous value put on individual freedoms and a feeling of acceptance of different cultures.
[00:30:58.687 --> 00:31:07.315]  And so having the government being accessed these technologies through the backdoor, being spied on in this way, you would think that the
[00:31:07.495 --> 00:31:08.719]  People here would be resistant.
[00:31:08.739 --> 00:31:09.923]  But there is some tension, right?
[00:31:09.963 --> 00:31:14.016]  Because the mainstream media seems to be taking a different position.
[00:31:14.753 --> 00:31:30.145]  Well, it's interesting that you should say that Holland is very liberal, personal freedoms, all that, and I think we still live off of that reputation we've built up in the, like, 70s, 80s, maybe 90s, but that's rapidly gone down ever since we've had a Christian government.
[00:31:31.166 --> 00:31:34.669]  Nothing against Christians, by the way, Alex, but... No, I understand.
[00:31:34.689 --> 00:31:42.735]  There's more of an extreme puritanical deal that is coming in and trying to, you know, clean out the famous districts, obviously there in Amsterdam, right?
[00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:54.644]  The liberalism that we're famous for, liberal drug laws and prostitution and all that, they're really cracking down on that very hard, as hard as they can.
[00:31:54.664 --> 00:31:57.607]  But there was a very high-profile political assassination just a few years ago.
[00:31:57.627 --> 00:32:00.210]  More than 10 years ago, I think.
[00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.911]  There were two murders.
[00:32:03.434 --> 00:32:06.635]  One on Pim Fortuyn and one on Theo van Gogh.
[00:32:06.795 --> 00:32:10.797]  And that has possibly instilled some... That seemed to be a turning point.
[00:32:10.817 --> 00:32:11.757]  Some fear in the country.
[00:32:11.857 --> 00:32:23.441]  Sure, well here's my problem with radical Islam or radical Christian or anything that tries to impose things on people just like political correctness tries to impose worldviews, language and behavior.
[00:32:23.521 --> 00:32:24.181]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:32:24.542 --> 00:32:24.902]  Christian.
[00:32:25.222 --> 00:32:28.623]  So I believe if you're not hurting somebody, that's not my business.
[00:32:28.723 --> 00:32:31.224]  I have my business to have my view on it, but
[00:32:31.664 --> 00:32:41.432]  I want my basic freedoms and, you know, to me, a lot of governments change the subject on the sex and things away from corruption, away from government narcotics trafficking.
[00:32:41.713 --> 00:32:46.096]  I mean, it sounds to me like the Netherlands wants to start laundering some of this drug money and wants it to be illegal again.
[00:32:46.377 --> 00:32:48.398]  I mean, they don't want to make drugs illegal to stop the drugs.
[00:32:48.639 --> 00:32:51.241]  They want to make it illegal to bring more of it in and make a bigger profit.
[00:32:54.344 --> 00:32:55.985]  That's your words, not mine.
[00:32:56.045 --> 00:32:56.846]  That's my view on it.
[00:32:56.866 --> 00:32:58.047]  That's what I've seen them historically do.
[00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:17.355]  This is Bernie Sanders and I'm quite upset.
[00:33:17.555 --> 00:33:24.298]  If you guys saw the Iowa Caucus the other night, you would know that I worked extremely hard for these votes.
[00:33:24.598 --> 00:33:30.761]  And the people that were working in the Iowa Caucus took what I worked hard for and gave it to someone else.
[00:33:31.081 --> 00:33:36.063]  A lying, cheating, horrible human being by the name of Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:38.244 --> 00:33:42.146]  I don't understand how anybody could like something like this.
[00:33:42.226 --> 00:33:54.492]  That you work hard for something your whole life and you earn something and then you're expected to give it to someone else who's not as deserving and is too lazy or more of a piece of crap than you are.
[00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:57.613]  What kind of person would even think about something like that?
[00:33:57.873 --> 00:34:01.235]  Hey, that'd be you, Bernie Sanders.
[00:34:01.475 --> 00:34:02.536]  Guess you just felt the Bern.
[00:34:03.656 --> 00:34:06.657]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:06.858 --> 00:34:07.478]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.301]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:34:14.641 --> 00:34:18.184]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:34:18.444 --> 00:34:21.067]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:34:21.387 --> 00:34:24.830]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.734]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts.
[00:34:28.854 --> 00:34:29.174]  I'm good.
[00:34:53.069 --> 00:34:54.110]  We're good to go.
[00:35:12.617 --> 00:35:18.719]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:35:18.759 --> 00:35:22.041]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:35:22.061 --> 00:35:23.801]  Here we go folks, I'm being assaulted.
[00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:30.104]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:35:30.204 --> 00:35:36.106]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:40.028]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:43.169]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:51.292]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:35:51.573 --> 00:35:53.613]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:35:53.673 --> 00:35:54.714]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:35:55.054 --> 00:36:03.822]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:38:03.809 --> 00:38:15.175]  And it's when you buy products like this, when you buy the Hillary for Prison t-shirts, that funds our operation and allows us to send reporters out in the field, just like our reporters in South Texas investigating the death of Justice Scalia.
[00:39:00.444 --> 00:39:02.626]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[00:39:02.886 --> 00:39:10.471]  Now, we came out to the Cebola Creek Ranch to investigate the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
[00:39:11.051 --> 00:39:17.476]  Now, this past weekend, he was found dead here at this ranch with a pillow over his head.
[00:39:17.956 --> 00:39:23.300]  Alex Jones came out, said he had a gut feeling that there was something beyond the obvious.
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:31.645]  You've got court judges here saying that this was a natural cause of death, that this man died from a heart attack.
[00:39:31.905 --> 00:39:37.969]  But there were no steps made to come out and look at the body and actually make a correct call on it.
[00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:47.096]  Instead, the county judge in Marfa came out and said over the phone that this was a natural cause of death.
[00:39:47.416 --> 00:39:48.336]  You also have a U.S.
[00:39:48.456 --> 00:39:53.520]  marshal that has zero ties, any kind of training dealing with homicide.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:40:01.165]  So now you have two people with zero training and yet we're supposed to sit here and take their word.
[00:40:01.746 --> 00:40:06.850]  This is a ranch that is owned by a man who gives money to the Democrat Party.
[00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:13.575]  This is a man who has been given military accommodations from President Barack Obama himself.
[00:40:14.235 --> 00:40:15.116]  Now think about this.
[00:40:15.916 --> 00:40:21.861]  If we had a Republican president, a ranch owned by a man who gives money to the Republican Party,
[00:40:22.935 --> 00:40:29.541]  In a liberal judge who was found dead in his sleep, the left would be going crazy asking questions.
[00:40:30.181 --> 00:40:35.066]  But we are called conspiracy theorists because we want to find out answers.
[00:40:35.606 --> 00:40:45.055]  Now what we know is that Judge Bishop was contacted to come out here and look at the body and make a good sound decision as to the cause of death.
[00:40:45.848 --> 00:40:47.209]  But she said she was too busy.
[00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:50.592]  She was over 120 miles away and couldn't make it out.
[00:40:51.172 --> 00:40:52.613]  Then they called Judge Beebe.
[00:40:53.534 --> 00:40:54.095]  Same thing.
[00:40:54.595 --> 00:40:55.316]  Couldn't make it out.
[00:40:55.756 --> 00:41:01.120]  Then it gets handed over to the judge in Marfa, Cinderella.
[00:41:01.881 --> 00:41:05.644]  Now this entire scenario sounds like a Cinderella story.
[00:41:06.444 --> 00:41:12.870]  This woman has already been involved in situations where she has basically botched
[00:41:13.732 --> 00:41:14.892]  Crime investigations.
[00:41:15.392 --> 00:41:23.694]  Back in 2013, in the Big Bend area, a woman was found laying on the railroad tracks, and a train hit her.
[00:41:24.554 --> 00:41:29.875]  The railroad companies came out and did their own investigation, believed that it should be looked into further.
[00:41:30.735 --> 00:41:33.336]  The family came out and said, we want an investigation.
[00:41:34.336 --> 00:41:35.816]  And what did Judge Cinderella do?
[00:41:36.356 --> 00:41:41.077]  She comes out, makes a phone call, and goes, uh, it's suicide.
[00:41:42.489 --> 00:41:46.211]  So now we have a path, a pattern of what's going on.
[00:41:46.632 --> 00:41:49.554]  This is a woman who is too lazy to do her job.
[00:41:50.054 --> 00:41:51.655]  She doesn't have the time to go out.
[00:41:51.975 --> 00:42:01.061]  We went over to Marfa today to actually confront this judge, to ask her why wasn't proper protocol followed with this.
[00:42:01.501 --> 00:42:06.465]  And now we know, looking at her past, that she does not follow proper procedures.
[00:42:07.305 --> 00:42:14.389]  David Knight and Josh Owens walked in to the courthouse and confronted her, and she basically just turned her back on them.
[00:42:14.849 --> 00:42:18.531]  I've given a statement to the Big Ben Sentinel, and you'll have to go to them.
[00:42:18.991 --> 00:42:20.172]  They have my official statements.
[00:42:20.652 --> 00:42:21.613]  So, they're your spokesman?
[00:42:23.035 --> 00:42:26.817]  Because this is a story of national importance.
[00:42:26.997 --> 00:42:27.717]  I understand.
[00:42:27.737 --> 00:42:29.378]  This is a story of national importance.
[00:42:29.478 --> 00:42:33.440]  And there's a lot of people who are very concerned that procedures were not followed.
[00:42:34.101 --> 00:42:36.922]  And they want to know who was making that decision.
[00:42:36.942 --> 00:42:38.783]  Was that something the sheriff was doing?
[00:42:38.803 --> 00:42:40.624]  Or is it something the federal marshals were doing?
[00:42:40.644 --> 00:42:41.704]  Is it something you were doing?
[00:42:42.265 --> 00:42:43.365]  Procedure was followed.
[00:42:43.885 --> 00:42:44.766]  And they have a restatement.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:54.207]  She's too busy with small town Martha to deal with a Supreme Court justice who died in her jurisdiction.
[00:42:54.928 --> 00:43:03.315]  You know, you might tell Judge Brevard that her actions like this to shut down the press only increases suspicion that there's something fishy going on here.
[00:43:04.116 --> 00:43:05.537]  You know, that's – it looks really bad.
[00:43:05.877 --> 00:43:07.599]  It looks bad what has happened so far.
[00:43:07.979 --> 00:43:10.762]  And when she won't talk to people, it makes it look even worse.
[00:43:10.782 --> 00:43:11.723]  It really does.
[00:43:11.983 --> 00:43:13.224]  So, this might pass on.
[00:43:16.271 --> 00:43:17.272]  There's a huge problem.
[00:43:17.932 --> 00:43:20.894]  This is not a conspiracy theory to want to find out.
[00:43:20.974 --> 00:43:22.355]  We demand the truth.
[00:43:23.356 --> 00:43:39.006]  Now the truth might be something that none of us like, but still we demand the answers to what is going on because this person leaving his spot and this seat being vacant in the Supreme Court sets a huge precedence for the rest of our future.
[00:43:40.187 --> 00:43:45.151]  2016 will be a very vital year for gun legislation.
[00:43:46.044 --> 00:43:46.724]  Obamacare.
[00:43:47.805 --> 00:43:48.645]  Climate change.
[00:43:49.085 --> 00:43:57.229]  This is a man, Scalia, who is at the forefront of stopping a lot of the stuff that the Obama administration was trying to push forward.
[00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:04.213]  And now the President's coming out saying that he is going to, as quickly as possible, fill that seat.
[00:44:04.653 --> 00:44:08.715]  Supreme Court Justice Scalia was the last true conservative that we had there.
[00:44:09.675 --> 00:44:13.497]  And if Obama has his way, he will put someone in like Loretta Lynch.
[00:44:14.895 --> 00:44:19.337]  And we will slowly see our freedoms slip away from us.
[00:44:20.237 --> 00:44:25.719]  This is a very serious deal that we are encountering here in our time.
[00:44:26.139 --> 00:44:30.281]  So I want to encourage you all to reach out to Governor Greg Abbott.
[00:44:30.721 --> 00:44:42.606]  Greg Abbott has the power to call for an investigation to make sure that this is looked into further so we do not get put in a situation where the left can use this as a way to put in somebody they need.
[00:44:43.266 --> 00:44:47.187]  Stay tuned for more reports as we follow the situation as it unfolds.
[00:44:47.587 --> 00:44:52.089]  Here at the Cebola Creek Ranch, I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[00:45:01.672 --> 00:45:06.534]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[00:45:09.437 --> 00:45:18.120]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:22.961]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[00:45:22.981 --> 00:45:25.302]  I'm observing what they're doing and they're all seeing me!
[00:45:25.322 --> 00:45:27.563]  I don't understand what's going on!
[00:45:27.583 --> 00:45:37.306]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:45.686]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[00:45:45.946 --> 00:45:47.747]  How can you ask such a question?
[00:45:47.767 --> 00:45:51.049]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:57.714]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in the community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[00:45:57.834 --> 00:46:05.180]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[00:46:06.314 --> 00:46:08.457]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[00:46:08.517 --> 00:46:10.240]  What I say go, see?
[00:46:11.061 --> 00:46:12.483]  I'm the law around here!
[00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:17.530]  He came, you saw, he died.
[00:46:20.414 --> 00:46:27.119]  We just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:46:27.519 --> 00:46:35.645]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:46:36.105 --> 00:46:38.507]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[00:46:38.527 --> 00:46:39.988]  You really don't have to trust me.
[00:46:40.008 --> 00:46:40.809]  You shouldn't trust me.
[00:46:40.869 --> 00:46:44.371]  In fact, by my actually participating in that, I will taint the news.
[00:46:44.932 --> 00:46:48.354]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[00:46:50.095 --> 00:47:05.422]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are I'm from the government and I'm here to help Brainforce is here ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:05.482 --> 00:47:06.823]  I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.123 --> 00:47:14.967]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed more focused less brain fog more energy more special reports and it's because of brainforce
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.

[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:03.038 --> 00:49:06.520]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:09.982]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:49:10.042 --> 00:49:14.864]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:49:14.884 --> 00:49:17.585]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:49:17.906 --> 00:49:22.168]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule.
[00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:27.633]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:49:28.074 --> 00:49:30.656]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:49:30.757 --> 00:49:39.285]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:49:40.319 --> 00:49:49.065]  ...is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:49:49.185 --> 00:49:54.309]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:58.512]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:49:58.592 --> 00:50:00.633]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:50:00.713 --> 00:50:01.694]  Is it one world?
[00:50:01.714 --> 00:50:03.095]  The central bank was in charge.
[00:50:03.415 --> 00:50:05.677]  We bugged Mr. Blake Stalin, we heard him talking to his lawyer.
[00:50:05.957 --> 00:50:08.138]  You see, we took the mic and we hit it up in the cell window!
[00:50:08.158 --> 00:50:08.619]  Wait a minute!
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.421]  What are you talking about?
[00:50:10.561 --> 00:50:11.982]  We bugged Mr. Blake's cell.
[00:50:12.922 --> 00:50:13.503]  You what?
[00:50:13.863 --> 00:50:15.784]  We bugged the cell with Arnold's tape recorder.
[00:50:15.944 --> 00:50:16.925]  Just listen to this, Paul.
[00:50:16.985 --> 00:50:17.865]  I can't listen to that.
[00:50:18.025 --> 00:50:19.907]  But Paul... Opie, I can't listen to that.
[00:50:20.027 --> 00:50:20.907]  I'm not permitted.
[00:50:21.388 --> 00:50:22.668]  But Paul, you don't understand.
[00:50:22.688 --> 00:50:24.810]  Opie, I can't listen to this.
[00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:27.692]  Now, I told you about eavesdropping.
[00:50:27.952 --> 00:50:29.112]  But Paul, this is different.
[00:50:29.433 --> 00:50:30.373]  Yes, it's worse.
[00:50:31.114 --> 00:50:34.016]  You overheard a conversation that was supposed to be private.
[00:50:34.416 --> 00:50:36.157]  Now, I can't be a party to that.
[00:50:36.587 --> 00:50:39.669]  But Pa, if you just listen to this... Opie, I can't listen.
[00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:41.269]  Pa, you're erasing the tape!
[00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:43.110]  That's what I mean to do.
[00:50:44.551 --> 00:50:47.813]  You bugged a conversation between a lawyer and his client.
[00:50:48.793 --> 00:50:52.515]  Now that's violating one of the most sacred rights of privacy.
[00:50:53.035 --> 00:50:54.616]  But Pa... No buts.
[00:50:55.237 --> 00:51:01.200]  But if it helps the law... Opie, the law can't use this kind of help.
[00:51:04.051 --> 00:51:11.256]  It's Paul Joseph Watson with InfoWars.com and I'm talking to Syrian Girl about the huge developments in the Middle East.
[00:51:11.776 --> 00:51:21.583]  Syrian Girl, we've got the Saudi Foreign Minister who came out and said that Assad will be removed by force, those were his words, if no political solution is found.
[00:51:21.943 --> 00:51:24.585]  They're talking about sending in ground troops.
[00:51:25.105 --> 00:51:28.007]  There are hundreds of thousands of Saudi troops massing.
[00:51:28.047 --> 00:51:30.829]  We've got armed forces from 20 different countries.
[00:51:31.369 --> 00:51:33.271]  My feeling is that it's all a bluff.
[00:51:51.626 --> 00:51:56.890]  It seems to be that they're using this as a negotiation tactic to bring to the table.
[00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:59.152]  And Russia has basically called that bluff.
[00:52:00.133 --> 00:52:10.843]  The Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that if the Saudi Arabians or the Turks send troops into Syria, this would be the spark for World War III.
[00:52:11.203 --> 00:52:11.784]  This is the
[00:52:12.564 --> 00:52:24.692]  Russian Prime Minister saying this, and whenever I've spoken about this, you know, people tend to react very skeptically, but it's the world leaders that are talking about World War 3.
[00:52:25.112 --> 00:52:31.156]  So the message is clear to Turkey and Saudi Arabia that Russia has its red lines as well.
[00:52:31.717 --> 00:52:35.019]  I don't feel that they would be crazy enough to cross them.
[00:52:35.059 --> 00:52:39.782]  This is just, you know, a threat, I think an empty threat, but even if
[00:52:40.788 --> 00:52:43.570]  Saudi Arabia sends troops into Syria.
[00:52:44.151 --> 00:52:47.294]  It won't change much because they already have troops in Syria.
[00:52:48.475 --> 00:52:49.796]  We refer to it as ISIS.
[00:52:50.716 --> 00:52:55.601]  So I don't see how they're going to change anything.
[00:52:55.621 --> 00:53:01.906]  So what message do you think they're trying to send with massing these troops and having these huge war games?
[00:53:02.006 --> 00:53:05.309]  What message are they trying to send if they're not actually planning an invasion?
[00:53:06.448 --> 00:53:09.450]  Well, it's just basically huffing and puffing up, isn't it?
[00:53:10.191 --> 00:53:34.669]  They're trying to say that if you don't negotiate with us and at least meet us halfway on Syria, whether that mean balkanizing Syria or allowing some of their stooges into power, because Saudi Arabia has its chosen leaders that they want to impose on Syria, you know, the democratic republic of the Saudi monarchy.
[00:53:35.191 --> 00:53:39.214]  want to impose democracy on Syria with these select chosen people.
[00:53:40.395 --> 00:53:53.805]  And the message is, if you don't allow us to have influence, we're going to step in to defend Al-Qaeda and ISIS, because effectively that is what they are doing.
[00:53:54.366 --> 00:54:02.191]  I think the Syrian military would be very interested to see Saudi Arabia invade, because that would be the beginning of the end of Saudi Arabia.
[00:54:02.892 --> 00:54:15.583]  Because so much of their military already trying to destroy Yemen, but the people of Yemen are still able to stand up for themselves and in fact have taken over towns inside Saudi Arabia.
[00:54:16.124 --> 00:54:20.087]  So I don't see how far their military can succeed in Syria.
[00:54:20.468 --> 00:54:28.495]  I think there are some elements of the Syrian government and military that will be amused by Saudi Arabia's attempts to invade.
[00:54:29.286 --> 00:54:33.028]  So if you had a blunt message for Saudi Arabia, what would it be?
[00:54:34.168 --> 00:54:35.489]  Get rid of the Saudi monarchy.
[00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:40.592]  To the people of Saudi Arabia, just get rid of it and rename your country.
[00:54:40.652 --> 00:54:43.133]  I mean, no country should be named after a person.
[00:54:45.035 --> 00:54:54.059]  It is Al-Qaeda that controls the town of Azzaz that Turkey is now defending against the YPG.
[00:54:54.359 --> 00:54:55.740]  That's what I wanted to get into.
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:55:04.224]  Now we've got, again, Turkish officials come out and they've talked about establishing a safe zone in northern Syria for the refugees.
[00:55:04.624 --> 00:55:11.447]  Of course, what's really happening is they won't allow the Kurds, as you said, to capture that strategic town near the border.
[00:55:11.867 --> 00:55:12.788]  But we've also got
[00:55:13.505 --> 00:55:22.848]  Angela Merkel now, the German Chancellor, saying that a no-fly zone over Syria is necessary to quote alleviate the refugee crisis.
[00:55:23.328 --> 00:55:29.910]  What's the real agenda behind this safe zone or this no-fly zone that's being pushed by Merkel and Turkey?
[00:55:31.331 --> 00:55:34.211]  To perpetuate the war and to protect Al-Qaeda.
[00:55:34.472 --> 00:55:35.652]  That is the
[00:55:36.821 --> 00:55:42.124]  First purpose and of course eventually to take over Syria and to balkanize the country.
[00:55:42.585 --> 00:55:49.249]  So the whole refugee thing and the human suffering is just being exploited to create more war.
[00:55:49.649 --> 00:55:53.972]  Let's not pretend Merkel gives a damn about human beings and refugees.
[00:55:54.352 --> 00:56:02.998]  If they did, they wouldn't have started this war and they wouldn't be trying to continue this war and wouldn't be trying to protect Al-Qaeda which has nested itself in Azaz
[00:56:03.678 --> 00:56:09.061]  And ISIS has also taken over the borders of Azaz and Raqqa.
[00:56:09.101 --> 00:56:20.107]  And the Syrian military is now on the brink of taking back both Aleppo and Raqqa, towns which have been taken over by ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[00:56:20.307 --> 00:56:28.751]  And it seems that all of the US bombs didn't succeed in doing that, what the Russians and the Syrians are doing now against ISIS.
[00:56:28.771 --> 00:56:29.952]  Well, this is the point, isn't it?
[00:56:30.891 --> 00:56:38.073]  For 15 months Obama refused to bomb the ISIS oil tankers, the transport vehicles, because of environmental concerns.
[00:56:38.553 --> 00:56:42.514]  Russia managed to wipe out a lot of them just in a space of a few weeks.
[00:56:43.034 --> 00:56:49.856]  Now we've got those oil tankers that were going into Turkey from Syria, of course controlled by ISIS.
[00:56:49.936 --> 00:56:51.896]  That supply line has been cut off.
[00:56:52.316 --> 00:56:54.097]  Turkey's obviously unhappy about that.
[00:56:54.737 --> 00:57:19.558]  So in summary, isn't it basically the fact that these jihadists supported by Turkey and Saudi Arabia, both ISIS and the FSA, are getting their butts kicked all over Syria now because of the Russian support in Aleppo, in Azaz, in these other places, and now they're desperately trying to rescue something from the complete failure that has been their support for these jihadist rebels in trying to overthrow Assad?
[00:57:20.859 --> 00:57:21.700]  It's exactly right.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.000]  It's a desperation move.
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:25.642]  I mean, what they're suggesting is ludicrous.
[00:57:26.022 --> 00:57:30.966]  They've been talking about buffer zones and invasions for years, and they haven't actually done anything.
[00:57:30.986 --> 00:57:36.169]  It seems to be just desperate talk of desperate losers, basically.
[00:57:36.569 --> 00:57:36.909]  And yes.
[00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.712]  Do you think it's the beginning of the end for ISIS?
[00:57:40.772 --> 00:57:44.034]  Now they've had these strategic defeats, or will they come back later on?
[00:57:44.074 --> 00:57:45.435]  Is it the beginning of the end for them?
[00:57:46.721 --> 00:57:51.968]  Well, you know, ISIS operates under the idea that God is on their side.
[00:57:52.528 --> 00:57:56.954]  And if they get defeated, it's really going to obliterate that idea, isn't it?
[00:57:57.554 --> 00:58:02.481]  So I don't see how they can continue to gain recruits and maintain their
[00:58:02.961 --> 00:58:06.802]  No illusion of being so powerful if they get defeated.
[00:58:06.842 --> 00:58:08.762]  I don't think they will be coming back.
[00:58:09.002 --> 00:58:11.823]  I don't know how long this war is going to be.
[00:58:11.843 --> 00:58:20.085]  I would say there's still a lot of clean-up to do, but I would say this is the turning point towards victory.
[00:58:22.126 --> 00:58:23.306]  Okay, we'll wrap it up there.
[00:58:23.406 --> 00:58:30.007]  Sirian Girl, I'm going to put the links to your Twitter and YouTube in the description box below, and thanks for joining us.
