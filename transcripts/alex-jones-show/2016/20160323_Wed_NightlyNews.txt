[00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:22.294]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.374 --> 00:00:23.616]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:25.639]  It is March 23rd, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:37.634]  Tonight, the United States has become an empire that our founding fathers detested.
[00:00:38.074 --> 00:00:43.297]  And David Knight explains why Ted Cruz is no George Washington.
[00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:52.802]  Then, an epic video is going viral on the internet, showing a cop backing down to an informed citizen in Long Beach.
[00:00:52.822 --> 00:00:56.443]  You have no business coming up and harassing anyone, telling them they shouldn't ride their bike.
[00:00:56.563 --> 00:00:57.444]  Oh, this is harassment.
[00:00:57.864 --> 00:01:03.449]  When you tell someone to not ride their bike when they're legally able to ride their bike, yes, that is harassment.
[00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:12.597]  Plus, MSNBC host Chris Matthews is told to stop talking during an anti-Wall Street rant on live television.
[00:01:12.777 --> 00:01:13.337]  Just a moment.
[00:01:13.357 --> 00:01:14.458]  Am I supposed to stop talking?
[00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.759]  No?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.320]  Okay.
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.301]  Somebody just told me to.
[00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:21.645]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:05.808]  And we begin tonight with new news out of Brussels.
[00:03:05.848 --> 00:03:07.809]  We have more information about the suspects.
[00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:17.876]  And we see outrage as Turkish president reveals they arrested one of the Brussels bombers in June and deported him back to Belgium and even warned authorities he was a militant.
[00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:24.082]  We see that Belgian brothers were named as the suicide bombers who struck the airport in metro train.
[00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:32.130]  The taxi driver who took the terrorists to the airport reveals that a fourth suitcase bomb was left behind because it couldn't fit in the taxi.
[00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:40.999]  And the cabbie was suspicious after the attacks and led police to a safe house containing a fourth bomb, ISIS flag and a suicide note.
[00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.461]  So, very icy details on that.
[00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:48.783]  And I guess they're still continuing to see if anybody else was involved.
[00:03:49.343 --> 00:03:56.567]  And when you look at this, you look at the Turkish President warning, it reminds me of a very similar situation to that of the Boston Bombers.
[00:03:56.587 --> 00:04:02.771]  You guys recall that the older brother Tamerlan had gone out to Chechnya and was involved in various groups out there.
[00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:11.795]  Russia, you know, that country that we haven't been on the best terms with for the past several decades, actually picked up the phone and said, hey, United States, you may want to watch out for this Tsarnaev guy.
[00:04:11.915 --> 00:04:14.977]  Long story short, the whole thing happens at the Boston bombing.
[00:04:15.777 --> 00:04:24.881]  And you think about how Secretary Napolitano, as well as many other people, were briefed on the older brother, but nothing was done about it.
[00:04:25.702 --> 00:04:27.123]  And we see a similar situation here.
[00:04:27.203 --> 00:04:31.405]  And it brings up the question, should we deport people or should we jail them?
[00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:32.125]  Because personally,
[00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:46.092]  Certainly I don't have an issue deporting a violent convicted felon, but you also have the notion that they could re-enter the country or go back, re-up and do some horrible things some other place, whether it's a terror suspect or a murder suspect or a rape suspect.
[00:04:46.292 --> 00:04:57.118]  This debate continues to happen and quite frankly I don't have a definitive answer, but it is something that needs to be addressed whether we should jail them or deport them back to their country of origin.
[00:04:57.518 --> 00:05:08.042]  Now, in some other news, a rather bizarre news, actually, concerning the Brussels terror attack, we see that an American victim had encountered terrorism before he went out to Belgium.
[00:05:08.443 --> 00:05:16.046]  It says, in all, officials say at least 250 people were injured in Tuesday's terrorist attacks, including three Mormon missionaries from Utah.
[00:05:16.886 --> 00:05:20.927]  Mason Wells' family said he was treated for burns and shrapnel injuries.
[00:05:21.428 --> 00:05:25.329]  Incredibly, this is not the first time Wells has seen terrorism firsthand.
[00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:31.091]  He was standing near the finish line three years ago, when terrorists detonated explosives at the Boston Marathon.
[00:05:31.471 --> 00:05:33.732]  Wells was also in France, but not in Paris.
[00:05:34.212 --> 00:05:34.833]  We're good to go.
[00:05:50.326 --> 00:06:02.035]  In a similar way, you guys recall back in the tragedies that were Sandy Hook and also the Boston bombing, there was CNN video of what appeared to be the same lady being interviewed by the network at both places.
[00:06:02.435 --> 00:06:03.776]  Now, what are the odds of that?
[00:06:03.977 --> 00:06:04.537]  I don't know.
[00:06:04.677 --> 00:06:08.060]  Pretty long odds that that could happen, but it's still in the realm of possibility.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.844]  So I don't necessarily think these people are in on it or some type of plan or crisis actors or anything else.
[00:06:13.904 --> 00:06:16.406]  It's just, you know, strange things happen.
[00:06:16.426 --> 00:06:17.327]  This guy just happened to be
[00:06:18.107 --> 00:06:23.170]  He wasn't in Paris, but he was also in France and he was of course at the Boston bombing as well as Brussels.
[00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.332]  So he's just one of those guys, one of those Forrest Gump type guys.
[00:06:27.352 --> 00:06:35.297]  They just seem to be at these apexes of history and hopefully he'll recover from his wounds and move on to a happy and normal life.
[00:06:35.817 --> 00:06:50.361]  Now, as we're talking about the terror attacks that are going on around the world, we can't ignore religious persecutions, because we do see groups like ISIS beheading people, places like Saudi Arabia beheading people, not necessarily for their Christian beliefs, but for other things as well.
[00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:54.562]  But now we see a Christian convert from Islam hacked to death in Bangladesh.
[00:06:55.422 --> 00:07:02.951]  Unidentified attackers hacked a Christian convert to death this week in northern Bangladesh in the latest attack in the Muslim-majority country.
[00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:10.679]  The incident occurred Tuesday morning, where 68-year-old Hussein Ali was hacked to death by two assailants wielding machetes.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.881]  He died on the spot.
[00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:17.426]  The attackers exploded a Molotov cocktail to create panic and left the scene on a motorcycle.
[00:07:17.867 --> 00:07:28.398]  The police chief added that while Ali had converted to Christianity several decades ago, he was not necessarily an outspoken opponent of Islam, calling into question the motive behind the attack.
[00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:36.883]  Basically, he doesn't know exactly why his Christian belief is suspected to be a motivating factor, but they can't say that it is the definitive thing.
[00:07:37.183 --> 00:07:40.025]  And this is a real form of religious persecution.
[00:07:40.105 --> 00:07:44.948]  I remember there are things much more frivolous, like the Starbucks cups.
[00:07:45.028 --> 00:07:50.311]  I remember a lot of people got up in arms about that, taking Santa Claus and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer off.
[00:07:50.831 --> 00:07:52.733]  A coffee cup is not religious persecution.
[00:07:53.374 --> 00:07:56.838]  Hacking a guy to death with a machete is religious persecution.
[00:07:56.858 --> 00:08:02.183]  So hopefully people will realize that and maybe we can get past the petty things and focus on things that actually matter.
[00:08:02.584 --> 00:08:03.585]  And this is one of those things.
[00:08:03.885 --> 00:08:08.850]  Earthquakes killed over 8,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless in Nepal during 2015.
[00:08:10.552 --> 00:08:25.920]  In the desolation, chaos, and widespread panic that followed, a surge in child trafficking was inevitable, just as it was after the 2004 tsunami in southern Asia, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, and the 2011 drought in the Horn of Africa.
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.161]  And it goes on from there.
[00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:32.604]  And I really didn't know that when you have these big natural disasters, child traffickers come in and try to take the children.
[00:08:32.624 --> 00:08:35.685]  But I guess that is, you know, ripe for the picking.
[00:08:35.725 --> 00:08:36.326]  You know, you show up
[00:08:36.946 --> 00:08:44.390]  It's kind of the old adage of the guy in the candy van or the ice cream truck, you know, shows up to give aid and comfort to the kids and then they run off with them.
[00:08:44.411 --> 00:08:45.631]  And that seems to be the issue.
[00:08:46.112 --> 00:08:57.658]  And UNICEF is defining child trafficking as the act of recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purposes of exploitation, either within or outside the country.
[00:08:57.678 --> 00:08:59.680]  And of course, there are many types of child slavery.
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.562]  Sex trafficking is a very big deal, but you also have forced
[00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:06.123]  Labor as well as many things as well.
[00:09:06.203 --> 00:09:08.905]  So it's one of those never let a good crisis go to waste.
[00:09:09.225 --> 00:09:13.748]  You know, like the bad guys like to say they take advantage of the situation to do things that they normally couldn't.
[00:09:14.229 --> 00:09:21.653]  And when you put kids in a van or a boat or whatever they're doing to render them aid, people aren't as suspicious when the kids are homeless.
[00:09:21.673 --> 00:09:25.336]  Maybe their parents died and people just come in and try to take advantage of the situation.
[00:09:25.896 --> 00:09:28.838]  It's very disheartening, but we do see that the U.N.
[00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:36.465]  is cracking down on child trafficking, human trafficking, and at least trying to clean up their own house, getting those dirty people out of the U.N.
[00:09:36.485 --> 00:09:38.606]  who are doing these horrible things to children.
[00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:43.430]  Now, that's a very sad story, but this should give you a ray of hope for humanity.
[00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.793]  Feds arrest 8,000 violent fugitives in a sweep.
[00:09:47.313 --> 00:09:54.579]  In Baltimore alone, 148 fugitives were swept up, including 23 murder suspects in an effort led by the U.S.
[00:09:54.619 --> 00:09:55.340]  Marshals Service
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.121]  We're good to go.
[00:10:11.938 --> 00:10:21.024]  In Brooklyn, Camden, New Jersey, Chicago, Compton, Fresno, Gary, Indiana, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Oakland, Savannah, and Washington, D.C.
[00:10:21.524 --> 00:10:23.325]  So they are making good progress out there.
[00:10:23.345 --> 00:10:26.588]  And like I said, people say, hey, why do you talk about the feds and talk about the cops?
[00:10:26.928 --> 00:10:29.109]  If the feds and the cops do bad things, I talk about it.
[00:10:29.169 --> 00:10:31.171]  If the feds and cops do good things, I talk about it.
[00:10:31.191 --> 00:10:34.473]  So good job to you, feds, on this for getting these guys off the streets.
[00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:40.717]  I think most people will sleep a little bit easier knowing that these violent offenders are not out there on the streets.
[00:10:41.297 --> 00:10:46.180]  Now let's talk about some, not violent offenders, but offenders, nonetheless, voter fraud.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:53.604]  If you guys recall, it was just a couple weeks ago during the Republican primaries here in the state of Texas, we had reports of ballot switching.
[00:10:53.624 --> 00:11:01.509]  Basically, people would go in, they would type in their candidate on the ballot, and then when they get to the submit screen, the final screen, they'd see that it got changed to some other candidate.
[00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:10.334]  And I personally, even though Rand Paul is no longer in the race, I went and voted for Rand Paul just to make sure that some other candidate didn't sweep up my vote and say that I helped push them to the top.
[00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:13.276]  But now we see a Utah voter reveals fraud.
[00:11:13.996 --> 00:11:16.678]  I literally had over 50 ballots in my hand.
[00:11:17.378 --> 00:11:30.528]  One of the voters described the caucus as a vote with no apparent controls, no credential checks, no ID checks, and ballots being handed around like napkins, with at least 250 ballots passed out to only 120 voters.
[00:11:30.848 --> 00:11:34.190]  And it's going back to the old deal of the
[00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:36.112]  ID for the voter.
[00:11:36.132 --> 00:11:38.152]  If you guys recall, I believe it was Project Veritas.
[00:11:38.172 --> 00:11:39.373]  Yeah, it was Project Veritas.
[00:11:40.173 --> 00:11:41.954]  Went up to, I guess, Washington State.
[00:11:42.595 --> 00:11:50.878]  And, not Washington State, excuse me, Washington D.C., and to secure the ballot for Eric Holder, the then Attorney General of the United States of America, in his district.
[00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:53.360]  He said, hey, I'll be back faster than you can say furious.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.161]  These are the type of things that can happen with voter fraud.
[00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.963]  All you have to do is know the general location of the person
[00:12:00.683 --> 00:12:03.504]  In their polling place, and then you can just go in there and request their ballot.
[00:12:03.564 --> 00:12:07.345]  It's a very big issue, but not everybody seems to think that it is.
[00:12:07.365 --> 00:12:11.806]  We've seen reports of dead people voting, people voting twice.
[00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:13.726]  Just like I said, ballot switching.
[00:12:13.746 --> 00:12:15.447]  There are all types of shenanigans going on.
[00:12:15.787 --> 00:12:18.107]  You don't have some type of voter ID in place.
[00:12:18.567 --> 00:12:23.128]  I think a good way to combat this is to have a public ledger.
[00:12:23.488 --> 00:12:26.669]  So basically you can go back and check and see if your ballot was switched.
[00:12:26.769 --> 00:12:27.889]  I know some people don't like that.
[00:12:28.049 --> 00:12:30.030]  It's like that old Shapiro joke.
[00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.672]  People tell you the most intimate details of their life, but you ask them who they vote for.
[00:12:33.732 --> 00:12:41.536]  Oh, I can't talk about who I voted for, but personally, it doesn't bother me to say who I voted for, president or sheriff or anybody else.
[00:12:41.596 --> 00:12:43.057]  I just want the best people in office.
[00:12:43.518 --> 00:12:44.798]  It doesn't bother me one bit.
[00:12:45.859 --> 00:12:49.421]  Now let's talk about some things that are going on in the mainstream media.
[00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:56.005]  We see that Chris Matthews was told to stop talking by MSNBC during a anti-Wall Street rant.
[00:12:56.753 --> 00:13:00.975]  How a young person coming out of school with a huge school debt is really owed something by society.
[00:13:01.015 --> 00:13:09.358]  We should give that young man or woman, both of them, something that they haven't had, some sense of economic independence, and don't make them debtors, basically, for the first half of their adulthood.
[00:13:10.099 --> 00:13:11.619]  And so that's about competing ends.
[00:13:11.659 --> 00:13:17.882]  Wealthy people on Wall Street, as he talks about, who make a lot of money, the traders, the speculators, they owe something back to society.
[00:13:18.342 --> 00:13:19.503]  And so I think that
[00:13:20.655 --> 00:13:21.016]  Just a minute.
[00:13:21.096 --> 00:13:22.320]  Am I supposed to stop talking?
[00:13:23.463 --> 00:13:23.623]  No.
[00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:24.165]  Okay.
[00:13:24.305 --> 00:13:25.188]  Somebody just told me to.
[00:13:25.669 --> 00:13:26.351]  No, please don't.
[00:13:26.946 --> 00:13:29.908]  It seems to be a lot of controversy going over at MSNBC.
[00:13:29.928 --> 00:13:33.210]  You guys recall that Melissa Harris Perry was having some issues over there.
[00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.633]  I don't know if she quit or got fired, but that whole situation was going on.
[00:13:36.653 --> 00:13:47.740]  And also, Jink from the Young Turks was told by the MSNBC president back when he worked there to tone down his rhetoric because people in Washington said that he was too combative towards those in power.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:54.845]  So I guess they have a narrative that they're trying to push out there and they don't like you rocking the boat one bit, but you know, what do you really expect?
[00:13:55.461 --> 00:13:57.482]  Now, let's talk about when you have nothing left.
[00:13:57.502 --> 00:14:01.684]  They have nothing left at MSNBC, but you can have nothing left when it comes to your personal life.
[00:14:02.024 --> 00:14:04.865]  And this is a situation that happened right here in the state of Texas.
[00:14:05.286 --> 00:14:11.869]  Basically, some homeowners were waiting on insurance and a possible FEMA assistance declaration so they could repair their duplex.
[00:14:12.249 --> 00:14:15.390]  But instead, somebody came down and tore down their house.
[00:14:16.131 --> 00:14:22.674]  And this is one of those things, just like you see the SWAT team raids going to the wrong places and grandmas getting pepper sprayed and kids having their faces blown off.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:30.704]  In a similar way, if you're going to knock down somebody's house, you should probably be very, very sure.
[00:14:31.365 --> 00:14:35.708]  GPS, whatever it is you have to do to make sure that you're going to the right place.
[00:14:35.728 --> 00:14:40.511]  Like you hear those stories about the guy has a problem with his left leg, he wakes up and his right leg's cut off.
[00:14:40.911 --> 00:14:44.674]  You should probably confirm double, triple check before you knock down the people's house.
[00:14:44.714 --> 00:14:46.835]  But now they say there's nothing left.
[00:14:46.875 --> 00:14:48.536]  And these are the words of Mrs. Diaz.
[00:14:49.117 --> 00:14:57.362]  On Tuesday, a sexist demolition company mistakenly tore down her duplex that Diaz and Cutler, that's the other gentleman, both owned.
[00:14:57.862 --> 00:14:59.624]  And he said he pulled up to the residence.
[00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:01.525]  He's like, yeah, my house is gone now.
[00:15:01.545 --> 00:15:03.666]  So I'm not exactly sure what the remedy is going to be.
[00:15:03.746 --> 00:15:10.551]  But yeah, you really need to take these things very, very seriously, because you think about a person who's already gone through the tragedy.
[00:15:11.071 --> 00:15:16.954]  You know, maybe they lost friends and relatives during the natural disaster, the property damage.
[00:15:16.974 --> 00:15:24.277]  I don't know how extensive it was, but they were at least thinking, well, I can just repair my home and continue to live there, but no longer is that the case.
[00:15:25.218 --> 00:15:26.258]  Now I want to talk about something.
[00:15:26.738 --> 00:15:27.719]  Standing up for your rights.
[00:15:28.439 --> 00:15:31.720]  And I always tell people to do this with an extreme amount of caution.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:38.762]  You know, when you see videos of me or Biggs or anybody else talking to police, you have to tell you there's a lot of things that go into that.
[00:15:39.322 --> 00:15:40.763]  One, you have to know what you're talking about.
[00:15:40.783 --> 00:15:44.164]  You can't, you know, start citing the laws and be stuttering and stammering.
[00:15:44.184 --> 00:15:46.544]  You have to be very confident in your delivery.
[00:15:46.564 --> 00:15:48.565]  And also, you have to know what you're talking about.
[00:15:48.945 --> 00:15:50.105]  You need to know your Bill of Rights.
[00:15:50.145 --> 00:15:52.847]  If you don't know your Bill of Rights, carry a pocket constitution.
[00:15:53.147 --> 00:15:58.529]  Guys like Eddie Craig, who's been a guest on the show, he has printouts, the things that you can keep in your car if you get pulled over by the police.
[00:15:58.809 --> 00:16:03.271]  You just pull it out and you go point by point, go down the script and he tells you everything that you need to say.
[00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:09.413]  With that said, if you do encounter an officer who's trying to violate your rights, you can try to do something similar to this.
[00:16:10.307 --> 00:16:14.730]  So, did you get your law degree on Facebook, or where did you actually obtain that?
[00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.533]  So, do I have to have a law degree to be an informed citizen?
[00:16:18.713 --> 00:16:24.537]  And when the law says you can ride your bikes out here, you have no business coming up and harassing anyone, telling them they shouldn't ride their bikes.
[00:16:24.597 --> 00:16:25.717]  Oh, this is harassment now?
[00:16:25.938 --> 00:16:31.481]  When you tell someone to not ride their bike when they're legally able to ride their bike, yes, that is harassment.
[00:16:31.781 --> 00:16:32.862]  Your opinion is irrelevant.
[00:16:33.142 --> 00:16:34.403]  The law states we can ride our bike.
[00:16:34.683 --> 00:16:36.805]  Now, do you have anything else to say, or are you going to leave us alone?
[00:16:39.335 --> 00:16:40.736]  You have a nice day.
[00:16:59.562 --> 00:17:01.485]  A couple years ago that happened right here in Austin.
[00:17:01.525 --> 00:17:05.029]  We went out to a bank after it had been robbed and it's a Larry Jackson story.
[00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:09.735]  Basically, Larry Jackson showed up to the bank after it had been robbed by somebody else.
[00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.237]  He showed up to cash a check.
[00:17:11.557 --> 00:17:13.099]  They said he had some fake ID or whatever.
[00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.802]  I don't know if they ever proved that, but that's what they said.
[00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:17.103]  Anyway, Larry Jackson took off down the street.
[00:17:17.123 --> 00:17:19.224]  A cop chased him down the street, shot him in the back, and killed him.
[00:17:19.624 --> 00:17:20.805]  So I wanted to do a story about this.
[00:17:20.865 --> 00:17:23.906]  And this happened, you know, a couple days before I even got out there.
[00:17:23.926 --> 00:17:25.047]  So I thought things had cooled out.
[00:17:25.487 --> 00:17:27.668]  Went out there like every other news agency in town.
[00:17:27.728 --> 00:17:29.629]  I was doing my stand-up and some cop runs out there.
[00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:32.010]  Not the same cop that shot Larry Jackson, but a different guy.
[00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.771]  He runs up to me and says, hey, what are you guys doing?
[00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:36.472]  I'm like, bro, I obviously have a camera and a microphone.
[00:17:36.512 --> 00:17:37.052]  I'm wearing a suit.
[00:17:37.072 --> 00:17:38.033]  What do you think I'm doing out here?
[00:17:38.053 --> 00:17:39.734]  He's like, oh, well, you know, we're just running high alert.
[00:17:40.174 --> 00:17:44.256]  Basically, you know, even though he had that knee-jerk reaction that day, I've seen that guy several times since then.
[00:17:44.656 --> 00:17:45.257]  He's a polite guy.
[00:17:45.277 --> 00:17:50.402]  I've had, you know, polite dialogues with him when I go to press conferences and APD and stuff.
[00:17:50.422 --> 00:17:52.264]  So I understand these guys are people too.
[00:17:52.324 --> 00:17:54.546]  Sometimes they are able to admit that they're wrong.
[00:17:54.566 --> 00:17:57.930]  They're just a high pressure job and sometimes they don't always make the best decisions.
[00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.353]  Now to round out our news tonight before we go on to more special reports.
[00:18:01.974 --> 00:18:07.295]  Border Patrol Union Chief says arrest of Afghanis and Pakistanis has skyrocketed this year.
[00:18:07.855 --> 00:18:16.677]  They say back in 2015 they had about five people from Afghanistan, 57 from Pakistan, and this year they have 18 from Afghanistan and 79 from Pakistan.
[00:18:16.697 --> 00:18:18.017]  So the numbers are jumping.
[00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:25.218]  And once again, I'm sure most of these are good people who just want to come and get away from persecution of whatever reason, but at the same time we have to secure our borders.
[00:18:25.518 --> 00:18:27.939]  Stay tuned right after this for more special reports.
[00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:35.552]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:18:35.812 --> 00:18:37.273]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:18:37.753 --> 00:18:37.973]  Okay?
[00:18:38.294 --> 00:18:41.155]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:18:41.335 --> 00:18:43.036]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:18:43.057 --> 00:18:44.377]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:18:44.718 --> 00:18:45.398]  This is Texas.
[00:18:45.638 --> 00:18:46.459]  You want to threaten me?
[00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:47.619]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:48.300]  You understand that?
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:54.223]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:18:54.664 --> 00:18:58.486]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:19:02.073 --> 00:19:05.797]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very, very carefully.
[00:19:06.518 --> 00:19:14.487]  Because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many, many people around me.
[00:19:15.008 --> 00:19:21.376]  I was a big sports enthusiast, but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old, up to about 22 or so.
[00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:28.102]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:34.408]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work, I stopped working out.
[00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:39.193]  And everything was okay for four or five years, but then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:43.096]  And in the next 10 years, I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:56.459]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances, and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight, and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.040]  I even changed my diet.
[00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.742]  I even increased the exercise.
[00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:00.303]  It didn't work.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:06.190]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed
[00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.177]  My whole life changed.
[00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:14.844]  I've gone from 200 and almost 80 pounds down to about 220 pounds or so.
[00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:16.446]  It is incredible.
[00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:24.635]  And in just the last three years, Super Male Vitality, developed by Dr. Grube for mfulworthslife.com exclusively,
[00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:32.462]  And products like the Survival Shield X2 Nascent Ionine have just done incredible things for my body.
[00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:40.090]  I work out less, even though I'm older, I've lost more weight, my muscles got stronger, my stamina, my libido, and so much more.
[00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:46.455]  The truth is, we went out to bring you the very best we could, true game-changing products.

[00:21:34.645 --> 00:21:35.546]  But where do you get it?
[00:21:35.846 --> 00:21:41.611]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:21:41.832 --> 00:21:47.557]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[00:23:11.442 --> 00:23:14.404]  For a long time now, there's been too much secrecy in this city.
[00:23:15.205 --> 00:23:22.450]  The old rules said that if there was a defensible argument for not disclosing something to the American people, then it should not be disclosed.
[00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.591]  That era is now over.
[00:23:25.292 --> 00:23:31.536]  Remember when President Obama claimed that his administration would be the most transparent in history?
[00:23:31.917 --> 00:23:38.181]  We have put in place the toughest ethics laws and toughest transparency rules of any administration in history.
[00:23:38.721 --> 00:23:39.142]  In history!
[00:23:42.025 --> 00:24:02.277]  Fast forward to today, Obama's administration will go down as the least transparent in American history, denying access to FOIA requests, censoring government files, and as the AP reports, a mountain of claims that the Obama administration couldn't find the requested documents on well over 215,000 occasions.
[00:24:04.358 --> 00:24:21.805]  The Obama administration isn't just non-transparent, it is also blatantly criminal, acknowledging that within nearly one in three cases that its initial decisions to withhold or censor records were improper under the law, but only when it was challenged.
[00:24:22.205 --> 00:24:22.725]  We're good to go.
[00:24:39.315 --> 00:24:39.635]  I don't know.
[00:25:01.155 --> 00:25:12.224]  Representative Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, said of Obama's black budget omission, The Office of the Director of National Intelligence disclosed the administration's aggregate non-military intelligence spending request.
[00:25:29.757 --> 00:25:36.540]  as $53.9 billion, up from $50.4 billion for fiscal year 2015.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:42.462]  And of course, all those billions are doing very little to stop terror.
[00:25:42.862 --> 00:25:52.126]  As yet, once again, Haaretz reports that Belgian intelligence had a precise warning of the recent airport and subway attacks.
[00:25:52.466 --> 00:26:11.310]  But rather than protect our freedoms as a result of the Brussels-Belgium bombings, the TSA is incrementally expanding outside of the airport into all forms of mass transit, as a blanketed police state of viper teams become the new norm at train stations, bus stations and sporting events.
[00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:21.277]  Well, Wolf, the TSA is preparing to launch a specialized group, a specialized unit at airports in major cities, the so-called Viper Teams.
[00:26:21.317 --> 00:26:26.421]  They use everything from bomb-sniffing dogs to advanced specialized screening.
[00:26:26.981 --> 00:26:38.629]  And although the federal government says there is no threat, when you look at the procedures we're seeing across the nation, it is clear that the attacks overseas has stoked increased concerns over the U.S.
[00:26:38.729 --> 00:26:39.530]  transit system.
[00:26:40.328 --> 00:26:45.833]  Ushering in random bag checks and drug sniffing dogs to become commonplace occurrences.
[00:26:46.253 --> 00:26:49.616]  You may say, what else are we supposed to do?
[00:26:49.937 --> 00:26:53.100]  Terrorist events are spiraling out of control.
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:27:00.907]  But if you pull back the curtain, it's clear that it is the entire New World Order system that is spiraling out of control.
[00:27:01.367 --> 00:27:02.308]  This really happened.
[00:27:03.934 --> 00:27:12.839]  His executive order 12,425 gives complete and total diplomatic immunity to all members or designate agents of Interpol.
[00:27:13.239 --> 00:27:16.361]  This big private police consortium out of Europe, now global.
[00:27:16.721 --> 00:27:19.242]  One of the dirtiest police organizations on the planet.
[00:27:19.703 --> 00:27:22.564]  Hooked in with just drug running, child kidnapping.
[00:27:22.945 --> 00:27:25.026]  You can pull up all the mainstream news articles about it.
[00:27:25.766 --> 00:27:32.547]  And they are to have total diplomatic immunity, something police, military, FBI don't have, and they shouldn't have.
[00:27:33.127 --> 00:27:37.688]  But worse than that, then the FBI, if they act through Interpol, they do get it.
[00:27:37.928 --> 00:27:38.788]  And then here's FEMA.
[00:27:39.088 --> 00:27:49.650]  This is a FEMA press release, NLE09, held back in July, with troops from 14 different countries to, quote, take on American domestic terrorists.
[00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.231]  So, so, I mean,
[00:27:54.178 --> 00:27:57.179]  The Army War College teaches they're going to use foreign assets in America.
[00:27:57.459 --> 00:28:04.080]  I mean, they're actually getting the police and military ready through the Threat Fusion Integration Centers for foreign troops.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.541]  Groups like ISIL can't destroy us.
[00:28:07.581 --> 00:28:08.441]  They can't defeat us.
[00:28:08.481 --> 00:28:09.661]  They don't produce anything.
[00:28:09.701 --> 00:28:13.702]  They're not an existential threat to us.
[00:28:14.042 --> 00:28:19.003]  Once your mind is enslaved, imprisoning your body is a simple task.
[00:28:19.404 --> 00:28:20.904]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:28:23.379 --> 00:28:34.142]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:28:34.462 --> 00:28:36.743]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[00:28:36.843 --> 00:28:38.944]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:28:39.604 --> 00:28:42.385]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[00:28:43.885 --> 00:28:46.606]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:28:46.766 --> 00:28:50.367]  Tyranny with a capital T. You should reject these voices.
[00:28:51.128 --> 00:28:52.448]  Everything that's been done
[00:28:53.646 --> 00:29:10.159]  With torture, vendition, the NDAA, the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, from day one, was focused on the American people, period.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:11.981]  That's it.
[00:29:13.132 --> 00:29:21.654]  It's always been about erasing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly, saying it's for Al Qaeda.
[00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:26.175]  Rolling out torture, saying it's for Al Qaeda, but it's really for the general public.
[00:29:26.515 --> 00:29:35.097]  Rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market systems in the name of fighting Al Qaeda, but really shutting down any type of free commerce.
[00:29:35.577 --> 00:29:37.518]  This is all about converting us
[00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:43.595]  From a free society to a tyranny with a capital T.
[00:29:59.602 --> 00:30:08.144]  Sure, the fact that Donald Trump may have 1,237 votes, a majority on the first ballot, is almost irrelevant to the Kingmakers, to the party elites.
[00:30:08.224 --> 00:30:09.305]  Look, they're petrified.
[00:30:09.665 --> 00:30:10.385]  And here's why.
[00:30:11.065 --> 00:30:13.406]  Trump is uncontrollable to them.
[00:30:13.786 --> 00:30:22.088]  So, let's not assume that just because the bosses and the Kingmakers want to steal this, that they are going to be successful.
[00:30:22.468 --> 00:30:24.889]  Trump has the most important power on his side.
[00:30:25.529 --> 00:30:26.350]  Public opinion.
[00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:30.673]  And as Abraham Lincoln said, public opinion in this country is everything.
[00:30:31.393 --> 00:30:36.077]  The big steal is going to be very difficult for the bosses to carry out.
[00:30:36.557 --> 00:30:47.646]  It's interesting to me, and I predict again, George W. Bush's clan, particularly Jeb Bush, will be endorsing Ted Cruz shortly because Ted Cruz is a Bush family retainer.
[00:30:48.006 --> 00:30:51.488]  Ted Cruz isn't the constitutional conservative you think he is.
[00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:52.789]  He's a globalist.
[00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.691]  He's backed by Goldman Sachs.
[00:30:55.311 --> 00:31:00.715]  His wife and he are our minor servants for the Bush family.
[00:31:01.136 --> 00:31:04.438]  She worked for Condoleezza Rice, getting us into the phony Iraq War.
[00:31:04.798 --> 00:31:07.641]  Then she went over and worked for Robert Zoellick, the U.S.
[00:31:07.661 --> 00:31:12.584]  Trade Representative, former president of the World Bank, former president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:31:12.604 --> 00:31:16.307]  And now the Federal Reserve is giving money to him and Hillary, but none.
[00:31:16.607 --> 00:31:19.630]  Zero to Donald Trump.
[00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.091]  Another incredible endorsement.
[00:31:21.837 --> 00:31:22.898]  Yeah, he's Dr. Evil.
[00:31:22.978 --> 00:31:28.285]  Look, if you ask me, Donald Trump has a long list of thank you notes that he has to write.
[00:31:28.945 --> 00:31:30.247]  He's got to send one to the Pope.
[00:31:30.988 --> 00:31:32.830]  He's got to send one to the Chinese government.
[00:31:33.231 --> 00:31:35.113]  He's got to send one to Vincente Fox.
[00:31:35.593 --> 00:31:37.035]  He's got to send one to Mitt Romney.
[00:31:37.876 --> 00:31:39.598]  Now he's got to send one to the Washington Post.
[00:31:40.499 --> 00:31:42.780]  All of these attacks are backfiring.
[00:31:43.321 --> 00:31:46.402]  All they're doing is winning votes for Donald Trump.
[00:31:47.223 --> 00:31:57.828]  And for the first time in my political experience, the massive negative advertising, the torrent, the drumbeat of negative advertising is having no effect.
[00:31:58.268 --> 00:32:03.131]  Voters are seeing it and it's moving them towards Trump because they see it as dirty pool.
[00:32:03.491 --> 00:32:06.773]  They see it as an attempt to distract them.
[00:32:07.173 --> 00:32:11.555]  And then above all, of course, it's time for Trump to write a nice fat thank you letter to George Soros.
[00:32:12.035 --> 00:32:20.338]  Because blaming Bernie Sanders supporters for the protests at Trump rallies is like blaming the communists for the Reichstag fire.
[00:32:21.098 --> 00:32:22.599]  This isn't a Bernie operation.
[00:32:22.999 --> 00:32:28.881]  This is Soros and David Brock and Jonathan Lewis and a Clinton operation.
[00:32:28.941 --> 00:32:29.641]  Poor Bernie.
[00:32:30.061 --> 00:32:31.682]  He's just an innocent bystander.
[00:32:32.162 --> 00:32:36.446]  These are protesters masquerading as Bernie Sanders supporters.
[00:32:36.786 --> 00:32:39.108]  But Alex, here's the most stunning thing today.
[00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:44.934]  A poll shows one third of Bernie Sanders supporters will not vote for Hillary Clinton.
[00:32:45.294 --> 00:32:52.901]  And those voters, I think, because they're against NAFTA, because they're against these international trade deals, I think they end up with Trump.
[00:32:52.961 --> 00:32:56.665]  And that is what scares the bejesus out of the Soros crowd.
[00:33:03.556 --> 00:33:06.938]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:14.443]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:33:15.044 --> 00:33:23.409]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:27.772]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:33:28.092 --> 00:33:33.456]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:33:33.676 --> 00:33:34.497]  We're good to go.

[00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:07.152]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:07.413 --> 00:35:21.859]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:22.819]  We're good to go.
[00:35:43.365 --> 00:35:51.211]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:51.371 --> 00:35:56.796]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a 6-day liver detox.
[00:35:56.816 --> 00:36:00.338]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:00.518 --> 00:36:04.522]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:08.545]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:08.865 --> 00:36:09.045]  I'm good.
[00:37:03.672 --> 00:37:11.534]  Joining us is Larry Nichols, the consummate Clinton insider, to talk about what's happening, what's unfolding.
[00:37:12.154 --> 00:37:13.835]  Larry, what do you want to tackle first?
[00:37:13.855 --> 00:37:20.417]  The election, the bombings, the latest inside baseball on the investigation into the Scalia death.
[00:37:21.037 --> 00:37:22.157]  What's front and center, my friend?
[00:37:22.978 --> 00:37:25.418]  Front and center, Alex, I believe, is the election.
[00:37:26.759 --> 00:37:31.120]  Just before coming on this program, I received information
[00:37:32.029 --> 00:37:35.271]  About the strategy from the RNC, the new strategy.
[00:37:37.133 --> 00:37:39.234]  And pretty dastardly.
[00:37:40.015 --> 00:37:43.357]  But you know, Alex, I gotta say this in front of your audience.
[00:37:43.437 --> 00:37:45.179]  I've done worse things in elections.
[00:37:45.279 --> 00:37:47.560]  I mean, I've rigged more elections than most people have voted in.
[00:37:48.761 --> 00:37:54.426]  What they're gonna do, and this comes from what you saw with Jeb Bush endorsing Cruz.
[00:37:54.806 --> 00:37:59.029]  What they're gonna do is they're gonna go to all extremes to make sure
[00:37:59.986 --> 00:38:01.287]  That Trump does not get 1237.
[00:38:02.588 --> 00:38:04.249]  They're going to do everything they can.
[00:38:04.289 --> 00:38:05.449]  They're going to back him.
[00:38:05.469 --> 00:38:06.870]  They're going to support Cruz.
[00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.252]  They're going to look like they're on fire for Cruz.
[00:38:09.472 --> 00:38:13.434]  But it's simply to keep Trump from getting 1237.
[00:38:13.474 --> 00:38:19.098]  At that point, they've got a brokered convention.
[00:38:19.935 --> 00:38:22.936]  And you know, Alex, I tried to tell people last time I was on.
[00:38:22.976 --> 00:38:25.156]  You said this 10 months ago on our show.
[00:38:25.256 --> 00:38:25.596]  I know.
[00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:30.758]  You know, these parties, folks, they're not government agencies.
[00:38:30.818 --> 00:38:34.038]  They can change the rules as they choose, when they choose.
[00:38:36.059 --> 00:38:37.759]  They're rigging it against Trump.
[00:38:38.419 --> 00:38:48.262]  Now, I would give anything if somebody in this audience had the ability to get Trump to call me because I can tell him what they're going to do and give a strategy against it.
[00:38:48.582 --> 00:38:49.422]  For example,
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:54.844]  They're fixing to start showing on the news that Trump's audiences are diminishing.
[00:38:55.965 --> 00:38:56.365]  That's right.
[00:38:56.385 --> 00:39:03.351]  They're going to start showing that his big speeches and all these people coming by the tens of thousands, they're diminishing.
[00:39:03.812 --> 00:39:04.793]  You know how they're doing that?
[00:39:07.415 --> 00:39:08.996]  They're doing that with George Soros.
[00:39:10.197 --> 00:39:14.241]  You see, these protesters that are showing up at Trump's speeches.
[00:39:14.281 --> 00:39:15.722]  They're blocking the people from getting there.
[00:39:16.542 --> 00:39:21.066]  Well, what they're trying to do, they're trying to get people to come out with violence.
[00:39:22.508 --> 00:39:32.037]  Start ruckuses because they know, they know Alex, that moral Christian conservatives, they're not into that.
[00:39:32.657 --> 00:39:36.641]  And so why would people come to a speech when they run the risk of getting hurt?
[00:39:36.801 --> 00:39:39.664]  Why would you bring your children to something that would be irresponsible?
[00:39:39.724 --> 00:39:40.685]  Sure, it's a chilling effect.
[00:39:41.882 --> 00:39:42.343]  It is.
[00:39:42.803 --> 00:39:44.804]  And then so, of course, guess what happens?
[00:39:45.225 --> 00:39:48.107]  You get to hear that his audiences are dwindling down.
[00:39:48.187 --> 00:39:49.328]  The magic is gone.
[00:39:49.528 --> 00:39:53.331]  So the answer is it's got to be bigger audiences for the First Amendment to counter that ballooning.
[00:39:54.131 --> 00:39:54.752]  Absolutely.
[00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:56.673]  You know, folks, I'm going to tell you something.
[00:39:56.893 --> 00:39:58.334]  I'm going to tell you how to counter that.
[00:39:59.275 --> 00:40:04.999]  Go to Trump's rallies when you see these paid protesters.
[00:40:06.047 --> 00:40:07.007]  Don't pay any attention.
[00:40:07.087 --> 00:40:08.908]  Don't get in a shouting fest with them.
[00:40:09.108 --> 00:40:09.948]  Don't do anything.
[00:40:09.988 --> 00:40:12.349]  Just pretend they are not there.
[00:40:13.529 --> 00:40:21.592]  Now the other thing, anybody that gets attacked, this is a little inside trick that I guess I can be shot for telling you, but I'll tell you.
[00:40:22.092 --> 00:40:26.674]  Anybody that gets attacked, they need to file criminal charges.
[00:40:27.594 --> 00:40:33.196]  But what's neat about filing criminal charges, Alex, these people are being paid to be there.
[00:40:33.757 --> 00:40:34.998]  They're being paid to be there.
[00:40:35.198 --> 00:40:39.661]  And so they go back and demand lawyers and all the rest of it and that exposes the racketeering operation.
[00:40:40.041 --> 00:40:40.562]  You got it.
[00:40:40.722 --> 00:40:51.509]  And whoever paid them to go to that speech and to protest and throw a fit and cause violence, that person is a co-conspirator.
[00:40:51.669 --> 00:40:51.889]  Sure.
[00:40:52.389 --> 00:40:54.711]  When are people going to start pushing back to Soros?
[00:40:54.811 --> 00:40:58.914]  I mean, that old ugly, you know, Nazi collaborator.
[00:40:59.374 --> 00:41:01.876]  I mean, I mean, why is that guy so above the law?
[00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:04.531]  Money, power.
[00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:08.553]  You know, he's right at the epicenter.
[00:41:08.653 --> 00:41:12.916]  You know, I told you, I told you until I'm sick of telling that they're not going to indict Hillary.
[00:41:12.976 --> 00:41:16.999]  I don't think there's anybody now that has any doubt they're not going to indict Hillary.
[00:41:18.219 --> 00:41:25.084]  And the RNC is doing everything it can to make sure Hillary wins.
[00:41:26.064 --> 00:41:28.646]  I know, I know it sounds crazy, but they are.
[00:41:29.503 --> 00:41:40.139]  They're going to pick their original candidate, I feel like, may still come back into the poll, because once they go to that broker convention, you understand they can pick anybody they want to.
[00:41:40.159 --> 00:41:44.044]  Sure, when you were on 9, 10 months ago saying they're their own group, they can do whatever they want.
[00:41:44.605 --> 00:41:45.426]  They can stage it.
[00:41:45.486 --> 00:41:47.727]  Even the NFL's own tickets say it's all fake.
[00:41:47.908 --> 00:41:50.650]  Now, it's not all fake, but when they want to make it fake, it is fake.
[00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:53.532]  It's even on the tickets like it's a WWF wrestling match.
[00:41:53.772 --> 00:41:55.073]  Well, the parties are even worse.
[00:41:55.413 --> 00:42:02.278]  They now have the head of the RNC Rules Committee on CNBC, I'm sure you saw that clip, admitting, look, it's all staged, your vote doesn't matter.
[00:42:02.538 --> 00:42:03.979]  She says, so there shouldn't be a primary?
[00:42:04.219 --> 00:42:06.441]  He goes, that's right, and laughs at her.
[00:42:07.162 --> 00:42:07.622]  That's right.
[00:42:07.762 --> 00:42:12.986]  And, you know, they go with this ruse that the first time around in the convention,
[00:42:13.579 --> 00:42:17.080]  The delegates have to vote with the vote of their state.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.801]  That is an out and out lie.
[00:42:20.442 --> 00:42:26.364]  The delegates that are elected, when they get to that convention, get to vote their free will.
[00:42:26.724 --> 00:42:28.605]  That is the actual rule.
[00:42:29.465 --> 00:42:33.306]  And all this is about is to strip Trump of 1237.
[00:42:33.366 --> 00:42:34.287]  They beat him at a 1237, Alex.
[00:42:38.231 --> 00:42:43.415]  And we're going to get an appointed presidential candidate for the RNC.
[00:42:43.515 --> 00:42:56.886]  And they're now openly admitting Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney, and having liberal media even mainline that that's okay to now have appointed candidates, there'll be a backlash against the Republicans, and Hillary will sail into victory.
[00:42:57.967 --> 00:42:58.908]  That's exactly it.
[00:42:59.528 --> 00:42:59.868]  That's it.
[00:43:00.929 --> 00:43:03.751]  You know, folks, I'm going to tell you, we can stop this.
[00:43:05.213 --> 00:43:06.614]  We can stop it, Alex.
[00:43:07.478 --> 00:43:09.780]  But Donald Trump, now I'm not trying to get a job.
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.002]  I don't want to work for Donald Trump.
[00:43:13.464 --> 00:43:19.069]  I want to do what I do while I still have breath in my lungs, which may not be that long.
[00:43:19.689 --> 00:43:21.711]  I want to do what I do.
[00:43:22.812 --> 00:43:24.394]  He has got to call me.
[00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:30.473]  Because as you know, Alex, maybe you can convince him I've got inside tips on what's coming.
[00:43:30.513 --> 00:43:31.074]  Just hit me.
[00:43:31.134 --> 00:43:34.676]  We're under martial law when they have parties appointing candidates.
[00:43:34.776 --> 00:43:45.643]  I mean, they've had that on the books since 76, Democrats in 72, but the boldness of it and the boldness of don't use the word mother or father and you use the wrong word, we're going to arrest you.
[00:43:45.963 --> 00:43:47.004]  And Europe's doing it.
[00:43:47.845 --> 00:43:52.988]  They've arrested the front runner, Marie Le Pen, who's a milquetoast conservative.
[00:43:54.909 --> 00:43:58.251]  People didn't recognize Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia in the middle of it until later.
[00:43:58.572 --> 00:44:02.134]  We are entering sick stuff, and rolling over to it, folks, is not the answer.
[00:44:03.735 --> 00:44:06.317]  I want to talk about solutions and how to counter this in the next segment.
[00:44:06.337 --> 00:44:07.778]  We got about three, four minutes left, Larry.
[00:44:08.298 --> 00:44:13.402]  You know, you were involved in all sorts of regime change in Latin America, black ops, something you can't get into, it's classified.
[00:44:13.842 --> 00:44:17.765]  But that's why they hired you for dirty tricks, obviously, you know, with the Clintons and the Dixie Mob.
[00:44:18.545 --> 00:44:19.406]  It's all the same group.
[00:44:20.455 --> 00:44:23.219]  But you're a guy that's reformed, woke up to it, and said, I'm not killing kids.
[00:44:23.239 --> 00:44:24.801]  That's the backstory folks have just tuned in.
[00:44:25.682 --> 00:44:29.146]  You know, you've found your soul again, as you said, and hit your knees, and that's great.
[00:44:30.183 --> 00:44:32.845]  But a lot of folks in government are doing that too right now.
[00:44:33.365 --> 00:44:34.986]  But the system's just moving forward.
[00:44:35.687 --> 00:44:37.468]  You talk about the Strong Cities U.N.
[00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:37.928]  initiative.
[00:44:38.208 --> 00:44:40.210]  That was in my local paper that the U.N.'
[00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:41.751]  's gonna tell my government how to work.
[00:44:42.171 --> 00:44:46.974]  I mean, I'm living under world government now, and the average yuppie has no idea what they're living under.
[00:44:47.194 --> 00:44:48.395]  What's coming next, Larry?
[00:44:48.995 --> 00:44:50.376]  And everything you just heard me say.
[00:44:50.877 --> 00:44:51.897]  Is that wrong or is that right?
[00:44:51.917 --> 00:44:53.438]  No, that's all right.
[00:44:53.659 --> 00:44:56.100]  Excuse the dog, somebody's walking by.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.201]  But let me say this.
[00:44:59.096 --> 00:45:03.277]  Executive Order 13391, I know you've reported on it.
[00:45:04.078 --> 00:45:08.999]  It is the National Patriots Defense of Liberty Enabler Act.
[00:45:09.739 --> 00:45:20.603]  That thing calls, Alex, that thing calls for federal territories to fall, all federal territories to fall under Agenda 21, number one.
[00:45:21.143 --> 00:45:22.183]  But here's the kicker.
[00:45:22.824 --> 00:45:27.165]  It also facilitates the President to bring in
[00:45:28.804 --> 00:45:31.285]  UN troops to this country.
[00:45:32.685 --> 00:45:36.946]  Now guys, if you don't think we're close, remember what I told you Alex about Cuba?
[00:45:37.307 --> 00:45:38.427]  It says it officially.
[00:45:38.467 --> 00:45:39.647]  It's been in the Washington Post.
[00:45:40.027 --> 00:45:45.989]  You said six months ago they were going to use Cuban troops as part of the invasion force because they can mix in and speak Spanish.
[00:45:46.329 --> 00:45:49.370]  I mean, if it was Chinese troops or Russian, folks would fight.
[00:45:50.802 --> 00:45:53.344]  Listen, it is six hours.
[00:45:53.504 --> 00:45:59.348]  They can have 250,000 black cat troops in this country.
[00:45:59.808 --> 00:46:00.509]  I have fought them.
[00:46:00.629 --> 00:46:01.309]  They're formidable.
[00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:02.930]  They are.
[00:46:03.691 --> 00:46:07.053]  Now, add to that, that executive order.
[00:46:07.093 --> 00:46:07.934]  Where did it come from?
[00:46:08.014 --> 00:46:08.854]  Where did it come from?
[00:46:08.934 --> 00:46:09.775]  Alex out of the blue.
[00:46:09.835 --> 00:46:10.716]  Why would he do that?
[00:46:11.616 --> 00:46:15.739]  Then, Obama normalizes his relationship with Cuba.
[00:46:16.219 --> 00:46:17.000]  But here's the kicker.
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.321]  Why did he go to Cuba?
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.700]  I mean, go down there to watch a ball game?
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:21.341]  Uh-uh.
[00:46:22.521 --> 00:46:32.303]  You see, there are plans that have to be made, I believe, towards the facilitation of bringing those troops into this country that he can't make out of the White House.
[00:46:32.604 --> 00:46:34.884]  And I tell you, the left would worship that.
[00:46:34.984 --> 00:46:39.985]  They would love to see foreign troops kicking conservatives and veterans' guts out in the street.
[00:46:40.025 --> 00:46:42.066]  They just lust for our blood.
[00:46:43.544 --> 00:46:46.026]  Well, I'm telling you, he's over there right now.
[00:46:46.226 --> 00:46:46.727]  I believe.
[00:46:47.007 --> 00:46:50.169]  I can't prove this in a court of law, but soon I will be able to.
[00:46:50.189 --> 00:46:52.351]  Castro looked like he was having an orgasm.
[00:46:52.631 --> 00:46:55.233]  The communists look like heaven has happened when he's over there.
[00:46:56.074 --> 00:47:01.779]  Yeah, and I'm telling you, they're working out the fine details of this operation.
[00:47:03.007 --> 00:47:04.009]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:06.833]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.114 --> 00:47:14.966]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:04.016 --> 00:49:09.358]  Patrols can be seen in the subway system where officers are checking bags for explosives.
[00:49:09.899 --> 00:49:14.001]  Signs at New York's Penn Station alert passengers about random checks.
[00:49:14.421 --> 00:49:18.042]  And the city's three major airports have heightened security as well.
[00:49:18.383 --> 00:49:26.786]  Expect to see extraordinary NYPD presence in the house over the coming days as a sign of our readiness to protect people at all times.
[00:49:27.007 --> 00:49:31.769]  But we're not going to be violating the constitutional rights of people and surveilling those neighborhoods that are...
[00:49:32.449 --> 00:49:35.051]  Before we go to the video from the past, which was part of a video I did of Alex.
[00:49:35.071 --> 00:49:37.032]  He was trying to educate the TSA and I put some clips in there.
[00:49:37.072 --> 00:49:38.854]  But this is a video from Texas Shrugged Book.
[00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:03.492]  Uh, somebody sent me this yesterday.
[00:50:03.512 --> 00:50:05.254]  It went out on the 23rd.
[00:50:05.494 --> 00:50:07.496]  Brussels attack is strange as Paris attack.
[00:50:08.196 --> 00:50:14.022]  And there's a clip in there which the guy shows of when they arrested the mastermind of the Paris attacks.
[00:50:14.262 --> 00:50:17.145]  They show him running past like five or six cops.
[00:50:17.185 --> 00:50:18.426]  He just let him run by him.
[00:50:18.867 --> 00:50:20.328]  He turns the corner, runs down the street.
[00:50:20.368 --> 00:50:21.569]  They fire one shot at him.
[00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:27.333]  And then he's arrested down the street, and it's just weird, and nobody even talks about how weird that is.
[00:50:27.513 --> 00:50:29.394]  It was a dramatic firefight.
[00:50:29.514 --> 00:50:30.695]  Oh, they call it a dramatic firefight.
[00:50:30.715 --> 00:50:31.596]  There's one shot here.
[00:50:31.636 --> 00:50:38.780]  You can see the one shot as he comes down, and then there they drag him off, and it gets slower and slower as we go by.
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:40.421]  You can see a slower version right here.
[00:50:40.941 --> 00:50:41.501]  Here he comes.
[00:50:42.102 --> 00:50:45.344]  You can see, look, they're like stepping out of his way, like, hey, come on, come on.
[00:50:45.624 --> 00:50:46.805]  Oh, no, he didn't grab him.
[00:50:47.545 --> 00:50:48.726]  He's, oh, I'm going to run him.
[00:50:48.806 --> 00:50:50.427]  One shot, you'll see it on the corner of the building.
[00:50:51.207 --> 00:50:52.228]  Poof of smoke right there.
[00:50:52.328 --> 00:50:52.789]  One shot.
[00:50:52.889 --> 00:50:53.369]  He ducks.
[00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:55.711]  Dramatic firefight.
[00:50:56.632 --> 00:50:57.973]  Well, maybe it is dramatic.
[00:50:57.993 --> 00:51:01.256]  It might be dramatic for them because they're not used to seeing the...
[00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:09.136]  The guy also makes a note that every one of these cops in Brussels is now in a full face mask.
[00:51:09.336 --> 00:51:09.537]  Yeah.
[00:51:09.557 --> 00:51:12.960]  Which you see, you know, only when they're conducting SWAT raids, not when they're out guarding people.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.263]  And now we have shots of police officers in the United States covering their faces.
[00:51:17.283 --> 00:51:20.246]  The incompetent TSA is now the Viper team.
[00:51:20.306 --> 00:51:26.251]  Yeah, and it's just amazing that, so I thought that was pretty interesting and that I think coincides with this
[00:51:26.952 --> 00:51:28.833]  This individual, the luckiest guy in the world.
[00:51:28.853 --> 00:51:30.633]  The luckiest, unluckiest guy in the world.
[00:51:30.673 --> 00:51:36.656]  Yeah, I mean, he's in three different terror attacks in three different countries and survives all three.
[00:51:36.856 --> 00:51:37.116]  Yes.
[00:51:37.456 --> 00:51:37.836]  Amazing.
[00:51:38.136 --> 00:51:40.557]  Yeah, well it was his third brush with terror.
[00:51:40.697 --> 00:51:45.439]  American Mormon, 19, left with burns and shrapnel injuries in Brussels attack.
[00:51:45.459 --> 00:51:48.680]  He also survived Boston and Paris bombings.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:52.322]  Now, to be clear, he was in Paris at the same time.
[00:51:52.362 --> 00:51:52.982]  I don't think he was
[00:51:53.602 --> 00:51:53.923]  I think so.
[00:52:07.236 --> 00:52:08.877]  He's the superhuman terrorist survivor.
[00:52:08.897 --> 00:52:14.759]  I mean, I don't know what the odds are to be in the area of three different terror attacks several years apart.
[00:52:14.819 --> 00:52:19.962]  Yeah, he's either the luckiest guy or I would never want to actually ever go on a vacation with this person ever.
[00:52:20.162 --> 00:52:20.642]  Exactly.
[00:52:20.662 --> 00:52:22.283]  Hey, now let's show people.
[00:52:22.323 --> 00:52:25.984]  This is part of a clip that we put in Police State for the rise of FEMA.
[00:52:26.024 --> 00:52:27.105]  This isn't the exact clip.
[00:52:27.145 --> 00:52:28.666]  I just went back to the original news report.
[00:52:28.946 --> 00:52:34.768]  But it starts off with a guy going through one of our internal checkpoints that are 100 miles away from the border.
[00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:36.009]  He's being asked.
[00:52:36.289 --> 00:52:37.229]  You know, who are you?
[00:52:37.269 --> 00:52:38.370]  Are you an American citizen?
[00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:45.772]  He gives a pretty funny answer and then it goes into the Viper Team News report from Tennessee is where it was and so let's go ahead and roll that.
[00:52:54.369 --> 00:52:54.989]  This is honest.
[00:52:55.029 --> 00:53:02.992]  Tennessee is now the first state ever to work with the TSA to deploy a simultaneous counter-terrorism operation statewide.
[00:53:03.112 --> 00:53:12.875]  This was a massive operation, really bringing all federal, state, and local agencies together to not only do random searches, but also create an army of agents on wheels.
[00:53:13.275 --> 00:53:17.696]  You're probably used to seeing these signature blue uniforms at the airport.
[00:53:20.077 --> 00:53:29.685]  But now, TSA agents are on the interstates fighting terrorism with visible intermodal intervention and response, or VIPER operations.
[00:53:29.745 --> 00:53:30.906]  Look at that.
[00:53:31.727 --> 00:53:34.269]  All across the state.
[00:53:34.289 --> 00:53:35.550]  That's a dry run.
[00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:37.031]  That is what they're doing.
[00:53:37.051 --> 00:53:42.216]  They're preparing for when an attack happens, which didn't even happen in our country yet.
[00:53:42.776 --> 00:53:44.116]  They're going to pull out all the security.
[00:53:44.436 --> 00:53:50.598]  But what's the most unsecure place in the airport is the entrances where they have everybody crammed in going through this TSA security.
[00:53:50.638 --> 00:53:50.758]  Right.
[00:53:50.818 --> 00:53:52.539]  And we've been saying that for years.
[00:53:52.679 --> 00:53:59.261]  And so now, of course, since this happened in Brussels, just the way that we described, that's what's now they're saying.
[00:53:59.301 --> 00:54:01.742]  Wolf Blitzer is asking, well, how far would you go?
[00:54:01.822 --> 00:54:05.723]  And do we need to put the TSA now out into the
[00:54:06.778 --> 00:54:07.478]  Driveway there.
[00:54:07.498 --> 00:54:08.379]  Should we have them in our houses?
[00:54:08.439 --> 00:54:11.120]  Should we have them in our toilet areas?
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.821]  The Toilet Inspection Agency.
[00:54:12.881 --> 00:54:23.166]  Yeah, we need to give them 24-hour access to our cameras and they'll have just a TSA base where they can just check in whenever they want to make sure that we're safe.
[00:54:23.687 --> 00:54:26.128]  And that's, you know, it is for our safety and security.
[00:54:26.348 --> 00:54:27.969]  Totally, totally uncalled for.
[00:54:28.009 --> 00:54:36.477]  Hey, before we get to that video that you want to show, I did get a tweet from a guy, DB, who was asking about this one-minute piece that I put on the air this morning.
[00:54:36.497 --> 00:54:38.058]  This is from Hope Girl blog.
[00:54:38.398 --> 00:54:40.800]  Gardasil vaccine becomes international scandal.
[00:54:41.341 --> 00:54:42.962]  And it's talking about two quotes.
[00:54:43.042 --> 00:54:43.963]  I'll read the first one.
[00:54:44.443 --> 00:54:46.986]  I predict Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all time.
[00:54:47.706 --> 00:55:04.557]  Of all times because at some point in time the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific feat it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer and that all the very many adverse effects which destroy lives and even kill serve no other purpose other than to generate profit for the manufacturers.
[00:55:04.597 --> 00:55:04.797]  Right.
[00:55:04.997 --> 00:55:09.140]  And that was a former industry physician who worked for Merck.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:13.242]  And who made the HPV vaccine Gardasil, and he said that back in 2014.
[00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:23.388]  And then we had a Dr. Sinhang Lee, who also back in 2014 examined a little girl who died six months after receiving the Gardasil vaccine.
[00:55:23.889 --> 00:55:32.754]  And he found DNA fragments from the viral gene that had coalesced with the aluminum that's in the vaccine and kind of were just sitting in there.
[00:55:33.314 --> 00:55:35.776]  And he believes they caused a lethal shock.
[00:55:37.797 --> 00:55:41.679]  These being inside her brain caused a lethal shock and then caused her to die.
[00:55:42.419 --> 00:55:47.442]  So that's from Hope Girl blog, Gardasil vaccine becomes international scandal.
[00:55:47.742 --> 00:55:49.082]  Stories like this really need to get out.
[00:55:49.303 --> 00:55:50.023]  They really do.
[00:55:50.123 --> 00:56:00.308]  And the fact that the way that they educate people on this, it actually ups your odds of getting all the other different kinds of cervical cancer that are out there because it's only one or two strains that it affects.
[00:56:01.068 --> 00:56:06.933]  And if your body is healthy, for the most part, your immune system is able to clear that out, especially with regular checkups.
[00:56:07.353 --> 00:56:10.356]  This is just a dangerous vaccine and it's not necessary.
[00:56:10.456 --> 00:56:13.358]  That Rick Perry tried to ram down everybody's throat and say it was mandatory.
[00:56:13.778 --> 00:56:14.659]  We can't forget that.
[00:56:15.079 --> 00:56:16.741]  So, this is the United States.
[00:56:17.101 --> 00:56:22.765]  We've shown video of little villages in Mexico where schoolgirls are writhing on the floor having convulsions.
[00:56:23.996 --> 00:56:29.298]  Twenty girls at a time are having convulsions after getting this, and the people on camera are going, we don't know what's going on.
[00:56:29.638 --> 00:56:30.458]  Nobody will help us.
[00:56:31.419 --> 00:56:34.460]  And they just keep saying, take the vaccine, it's safe and effective, safe and effective.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:40.162]  And then I had to debate that clown from The Young Turks, who's just like, well, some vaccines should be mandatory.
[00:56:40.822 --> 00:56:41.062]  Yeah.
[00:56:41.983 --> 00:56:42.163]  Okay.
[00:56:42.363 --> 00:56:44.145]  Well, you sound like a conspiracy theorist.
[00:56:44.165 --> 00:56:44.705]  Yeah, I know.
[00:56:45.386 --> 00:56:47.608]  So, talking about another conspiracy theory.
[00:56:48.329 --> 00:56:58.097]  So, there's this new program out, and we've seen all these face-swapping apps, like if you're on Snapchat, they have where you can face-swap with people.
[00:56:58.558 --> 00:57:02.521]  And now there's a face-swapping technology called Face-to-Face.
[00:57:03.242 --> 00:57:07.606]  And if you guys can go ahead and roll the B-roll for those of us who are, if you're listening
[00:57:08.286 --> 00:57:13.470]  Watching us on the live stream, you can see this video that's up there, but it's face-to-face.
[00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:34.765]  It requires only target footage, which in this case, they're using footage of George W. Bush or Vladimir Putin, so they can take an actor or video from a news broadcast, and then there's an actor who, on the side, it records their face, and so that actor is able to say whatever they want
[00:57:35.325 --> 00:57:38.827]  And it morphs the video on the news broadcast.
[00:57:52.935 --> 00:58:01.099]  And then somebody releases it out there, and then it becomes news through Twitter, and before people have any time to realize it's a hoax, it's done.
[00:58:01.119 --> 00:58:06.021]  People would have to go back and actually find the original clip and go, no, here's what he actually said, this is something else.
[00:58:06.301 --> 00:58:10.243]  Now they're saying, oh, it's just a university research project at this point.
[00:58:10.743 --> 00:58:13.664]  A university, why are they, why?
[00:58:14.285 --> 00:58:21.768]  There's nothing about this that you would want to use it for other than some sort of nefarious project blue beam type thing.
[00:58:22.677 --> 00:58:25.800]  Yeah, or just create fake news, which we've seen the CIA do.
[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:27.361]  Now they can do it on American soil.
[00:58:27.381 --> 00:58:31.284]  Those laws have been lifted, where they can just go and do whatever they want.
[00:58:32.782 --> 00:58:35.643]  You think this university has this technology and nobody else has it.
[00:58:36.004 --> 00:58:36.264]  Right.
[00:58:36.344 --> 00:58:38.745]  Sadly, sadly, sadly mistaken.
[00:58:38.765 --> 00:58:41.526]  I mean this is just what they are showing us.
[00:58:41.726 --> 00:58:41.927]  Right.
[00:58:41.987 --> 00:58:45.408]  And so obviously this kind of technology already exists.
[00:58:45.648 --> 00:58:46.869]  The things are already out there.
[00:58:47.029 --> 00:58:52.692]  So just be aware that you really do have to be conscious of what they're showing you.
[00:58:53.552 --> 00:58:54.613]  Well that's it for our show.
[00:58:54.633 --> 00:58:59.055]  I'm Jakari Jackson from the Info Wars Command Center and we'll see you again tomorrow night.
