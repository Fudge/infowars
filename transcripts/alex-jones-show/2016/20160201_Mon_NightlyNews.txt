[00:00:01.403 --> 00:00:08.647]  Would you make it shallow, so I can feel the rain?
[00:00:10.248 --> 00:00:10.969]  Gravy.
[00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:18.153]  Meryl Stonewall, 1903 to 1954.
[00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:22.275]  She lost both of her babies in the sacrilege.
[00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.753]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News live coverage of the Iowa caucus kicking off the 2016 election campaign.
[00:01:10.793 --> 00:01:14.355]  I'm David Knight, with me are Leanne McAdoo and Jakari Jackson.
[00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:18.056]  We're going to be covering this as the results come in.
[00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:20.697]  Now they have just started the caucus at this moment.
[00:01:21.098 --> 00:01:23.959]  Seven o'clock central time is when the Iowa caucus begin.
[00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.252]  They expect this year they're going to have results early and that's something we're going to talk about is what the caucus process is and of course Microsoft's involvement in this.
[00:01:33.272 --> 00:01:36.857]  We're also going to look back at the history of the Iowa caucus.
[00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:39.962]  We're going to look back at what has happened in the last couple of weeks with
[00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:40.542]  Thank you.
[00:01:55.717 --> 00:01:57.197]  Yeah, well this will be very exciting.
[00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:04.200]  I know there's a lot of first-timers out there at the caucus that can't wait to be heard and have their voices raised there.
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.401]  And we're going to be seeing a lot of peer pressure going on.
[00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:10.201]  I guess that's how the Democratic caucuses go.
[00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:17.744]  It's more kind of you pressure your groups into voting for yours or in the Cruz camp you send out peer pressure mailers.
[00:02:18.464 --> 00:02:19.805]  Funny mailers, yeah.
[00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:27.373]  And we'll also have Richard Rees, who's on the ground out there in Iowa, so he'll have a chance to give us an eyewitness take and also talk to the great viewers who are actually out there in the area.
[00:02:27.393 --> 00:02:28.094]  That's right.
[00:02:28.474 --> 00:02:34.200]  Now tonight, we're going to take a look quickly at the difference between the Republican and Democratic caucuses, as Leanne just pointed out.
[00:02:34.565 --> 00:02:37.026]  It's a little bit different between the Republicans and the Democrats.
[00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:46.007]  When they get together in a meeting facility, the people in the small areas, as either Republican or Democrat, you can register at the door.
[00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:53.769]  And I think that's going to be pretty important because I think there's going to be a lot of Reagan Democrats who are going to be crossing over to vote for Donald Trump.
[00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.470]  And I think that's going to be something that's really going to be important tonight.
[00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.393]  Now, basically what they do for the Republican Party, they separate everyone and you can speak for your particular candidates.
[00:03:04.794 --> 00:03:09.576]  They have people stand up representing each one of the candidates and then they just have a secret ballot vote.
[00:03:09.896 --> 00:03:13.838]  They put those in the boxes and then they count those and then they transmit that to the state party.
[00:03:13.858 --> 00:03:16.119]  For the Democrats, though, it's a little bit different.
[00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.220]  You want to tell us about that, Leon?
[00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:36.254]  Well, we've got the total number of voters at the caucus, they're counted, the voters gather in a large room, they talk amongst themselves, and they convince one another how their candidate's the biggest, the baddest, he's the best one, and then they're asked to vote by grouping into little collectives of this is who I choose, this is who
[00:03:36.914 --> 00:03:37.374]  We're good to go.
[00:03:53.061 --> 00:03:53.582]  Yeah.
[00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:57.425]  Very much reflects the differences between the two parties as well.
[00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:04.512]  I think what you have with the Democrat process, again, they break into areas like this one in particular, there'll be four areas.
[00:04:04.552 --> 00:04:06.514]  There's three candidates and then undecided.
[00:04:06.694 --> 00:04:13.681]  So everybody's going to go into their little quadrants and then they're, I guess, they're going to be kind of talking and yelling and trying to convert people.
[00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:17.464]  Sounds kind of like a Chicago trade trade thing.
[00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:18.806]  I don't know what the deal is.
[00:04:18.886 --> 00:04:19.927]  It's a very interesting thing.
[00:04:19.987 --> 00:04:25.993]  And as we've been talking about, and I know you've been talking about this a lot, David, how Microsoft is actually involved in counting the votes.
[00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:28.956]  And we have a article here from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:28.976 --> 00:04:32.779]  Microsoft calls Iowa for Hillary before it helps count the vote.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.642]  So they're already saying that Hillary is going to be the winner or the
[00:04:36.383 --> 00:04:37.924]  It's another way to push the voters' perceptions.
[00:04:58.581 --> 00:05:03.863]  The Republican Party will have its own polling organizations, and the Democrats will as well.
[00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:10.465]  They get different results, and we've seen radically different polls versus the election process many times in the past.
[00:05:10.765 --> 00:05:15.587]  But when you look at what Microsoft is doing, I really don't understand the need for it.
[00:05:16.067 --> 00:05:32.455]  Now they're saying we had to do this because look at the mess that we had back in 2012, where first Romney was pronounced the winner, then we had Santorum pronounced the winner, but you know, everybody thought that it was going to be Ron Paul because he was the one that had the big crowds and nobody, especially Santorum, nobody was showing up with Santorum to follow him.
[00:05:33.235 --> 00:05:41.962]  I looked at that and I thought, yeah, this is kind of rigged, but they changed the winner from Romney to Santorum and there's only eight votes apart between them and so forth.
[00:05:41.982 --> 00:05:46.946]  What they're saying is that that all happened not because they were playing games in the Republican Party.
[00:05:46.966 --> 00:05:56.293]  And of course we saw a lot of suspicious and fraudulent, obviously fraudulent, behavior in subsequent primaries and caucuses where they had, I think it was in Maine, where they were
[00:05:56.673 --> 00:05:57.313]  We're good to go.
[00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:21.707]  A message for them, okay?
[00:06:21.968 --> 00:06:24.790]  You could use a fax.
[00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.812]  You could use a fax, you could use a text, you could use email.
[00:06:27.852 --> 00:06:29.373]  Maybe Hillary could help them do the emails.
[00:06:29.694 --> 00:06:38.941]  But, you know, why is it that they have to have this special app on a phone or a pad from Microsoft and I don't think they're really going to mess with it this time.
[00:06:39.481 --> 00:06:49.989]  They're going to gain people's trust with it this time until people don't really have a secondary auditing of this and really pay much attention and then at that point they can play some games when it's close.
[00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.133]  Right, well like there was the huge scandal with the voting machines and how Romney's
[00:06:54.973 --> 00:06:55.154]  Yeah.
[00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:14.159]  There's a huge issue, and that's what's going to be tallying your votes.
[00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:17.362]  Why do we need to have electronic tabulation of this?
[00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:22.948]  I mean, if this is something that is important enough, we can take the time to do it with paper trails, it can be audited.
[00:07:23.088 --> 00:07:29.035]  Or, if you want to get electronic, then let's have a system where we can audit and see how we voted.
[00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:31.295]  Yes, if our vote is recorded, exactly.
[00:07:31.455 --> 00:07:33.636]  I have a receipt that's printed up, something like that.
[00:07:33.676 --> 00:07:39.257]  But Bev Harris has said, hey, it's just paper slips and people counting them and people watching them counting them.
[00:07:39.597 --> 00:07:42.357]  And of course, there's a lot of different places where fraud can come in.
[00:07:42.377 --> 00:07:45.738]  You can have fraudulent voters with bad ID that's not checked.
[00:07:45.758 --> 00:07:51.519]  You can have ballot stuffing and that can happen either at the polling place or it can happen while it's in transition.
[00:07:51.559 --> 00:07:56.900]  So you have to have somebody checking the custody of the votes until they are counted and audited and that sort of thing.
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.460]  So there's a lot of different places
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.502]  Where they can mess with this.
[00:08:01.662 --> 00:08:05.465]  This just adds one more aspect that I think is totally unnecessary.
[00:08:05.546 --> 00:08:13.392]  Well, and I know with these voting machines, they have it to where whoever is running the precinct, they're supposed to be the only ones with access to the machines.
[00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:16.254]  And last time around, they had left them open.
[00:08:16.394 --> 00:08:18.716]  So anyone could get in there and change the numbers.
[00:08:18.997 --> 00:08:21.519]  Same sort of thing can happen with the back end of an app.
[00:08:21.939 --> 00:08:26.723]  So if you really want to prove that nothing nefarious is going on, leave it open.
[00:08:27.463 --> 00:08:31.607]  I was going to chime in and say, also, we've seen Project Veritas.
[00:08:31.647 --> 00:08:35.871]  They got the voting ballot for Eric Holder, you know, up in Washington, D.C.
[00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:38.253]  So these things are very far from perfect.
[00:08:38.733 --> 00:08:40.395]  You know, we don't have any type of verification.
[00:08:40.735 --> 00:08:47.401]  Or as you were saying, David, ways to go back and double check, as you pointed out, Leanne, people who have been dead are actually voting in elections currently.
[00:08:47.461 --> 00:08:48.562]  It's completely ridiculous.
[00:08:48.582 --> 00:08:48.702]  Yeah.
[00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:55.066]  Yeah, when they make it electronic, then what you've done is you've introduced a whole new set of problems on top of what you would normally have.
[00:08:55.366 --> 00:09:01.570]  There could be errors in the software itself, or there could be malicious hacking anywhere along the stream.
[00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.033]  And of course, you know, who would think that in politics somebody would maliciously hack something?
[00:09:06.073 --> 00:09:07.454]  I mean, it's like, who would imagine?
[00:09:07.614 --> 00:09:12.256]  That's almost like being so paranoid that you would think somebody would be looking to find the Secretary of State's emails.
[00:09:12.317 --> 00:09:14.478]  I mean, who would want to look at their emails?
[00:09:14.978 --> 00:09:17.299]  Other than pretty much every other government on earth.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.701]  So, you know, I would be concerned about that.
[00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:20.581]  And Guccifer and others.
[00:09:20.621 --> 00:09:22.162]  We'll get to more on that later.
[00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:31.587]  Well, and I think it's interesting when they call the winners, they called the first four primaries for Donald Trump is what Microsoft is believing.
[00:09:31.627 --> 00:09:32.927]  They think he's going to run all of them.
[00:09:32.987 --> 00:09:37.510]  Of course, this month in January, we have the Iowa caucus in New Hampshire, then we have
[00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:43.957]  South Carolina, then Nevada, and then we have a slew of states that are going to be voting in March.
[00:09:44.678 --> 00:09:47.340]  But they've said the first four would be a run-up for him.
[00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:54.769]  And of course, that's the importance of these things, is trying to create a perception with the donors, with the voters, of who's in front.
[00:09:55.109 --> 00:09:55.309]  Right.
[00:09:55.489 --> 00:09:56.190]  And that's what you said.
[00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.291]  It's a perception.
[00:09:57.311 --> 00:10:05.018]  Yeah, you know, just like when we saw Ron Paul in the last election, they try to keep up the perception that he didn't have any support, even though he would go out to these college universities.
[00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:08.541]  He'd have the largest crowds by far, but nobody showed up for on.
[00:10:08.561 --> 00:10:08.741]  Right.
[00:10:08.801 --> 00:10:13.865]  And I know that Alex did a report there in 2012 about them actually giving his votes to another candidate.
[00:10:14.366 --> 00:10:15.186]  A huge scandal there.
[00:10:15.226 --> 00:10:16.748]  And, you know, just whatever.
[00:10:16.888 --> 00:10:17.829]  He didn't even exist.
[00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:21.512]  He wasn't even shown on the polls there on MSNBC or CNN.
[00:10:22.032 --> 00:10:25.497]  Well, so they're promising tonight that we're going to have the returns fairly quickly.
[00:10:25.577 --> 00:10:28.281]  So the caucuses started at seven o'clock.
[00:10:28.301 --> 00:10:31.025]  They're saying they think returns are going to start coming in at about 730.
[00:10:31.146 --> 00:10:34.550]  So we're going to keep you advised as to what happens with that.
[00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:37.274]  Now, the interesting thing is, is that as this is
[00:10:38.496 --> 00:10:51.284]  Coming to fruition, we see that as some of the favorite establishment candidates like Jeb Bush are falling by the wayside, the donors are starting to move to Rubio and to Ted Cruz.
[00:10:51.344 --> 00:10:52.425]  And who is it that we have on the line?
[00:10:52.445 --> 00:10:53.606]  We have Richard Reeves.
[00:10:53.846 --> 00:10:55.887]  Let's go to Richard Reeves in Iowa.
[00:10:55.927 --> 00:10:56.908]  He's there on the ground.
[00:10:58.038 --> 00:11:02.763]  Yes, sir, David, and I'll have to speak quietly because the caucus is underway here.
[00:11:02.843 --> 00:11:09.189]  We are at Bear Meadows Elementary Gym in West Des Moines, Iowa at a Republican caucus.
[00:11:09.809 --> 00:11:15.135]  The precinct chair is currently administering the meeting and they are starting their business.
[00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:18.118]  They opened up with a pledge of allegiance and
[00:11:19.756 --> 00:11:24.019]  It won't be long and we'll be seeing some voting happen right here in Fair Meadows, West Des Moines.
[00:11:24.439 --> 00:11:24.999]  Very interesting.
[00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:29.162]  Now Richard, they're going to be putting, they're going to have some people that are going to be speaking, is that correct?
[00:11:29.662 --> 00:11:31.303]  For each of the candidates, that's what I understand.
[00:11:31.343 --> 00:11:35.005]  And then they will take a ballot and stick that in the balance, is that correct?
[00:11:35.894 --> 00:11:36.655]  That is correct.
[00:11:36.735 --> 00:11:39.917]  They're supposed to have speakers, theoretically, for each candidate.
[00:11:39.957 --> 00:11:50.185]  I suspect that there may be a few candidates that maybe don't have speakers, but I think they allow two to five minutes per speaker, and it'll be interesting to see.
[00:11:50.265 --> 00:11:52.687]  We should have that start up here, I guess, pretty soon.
[00:11:53.748 --> 00:11:55.049]  About how many people are there?
[00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:58.752]  Is it a big turnout, or is it considered very little?
[00:11:59.172 --> 00:12:02.715]  They've got the gym full here, and I know... Oh yeah, that's a lot of people.
[00:12:03.496 --> 00:12:15.121]  Yeah, at this elementary school, they've also got a Democratic caucus going on in another part of the school, and they were lined up outside the front door there.
[00:12:15.141 --> 00:12:20.524]  So, I think the turnout on both sides is going to be pretty big, David.
[00:12:20.724 --> 00:12:26.847]  You know, the Democrat one might actually be more interesting, because that's where they don't have a secret ballot.
[00:12:26.867 --> 00:12:31.709]  They just basically kind of negotiate back and forth trying to convert each other as they're standing there.
[00:12:31.969 --> 00:12:33.934]  Yeah, and we know a lot of people are feeling the burn.
[00:12:33.994 --> 00:12:39.667]  It might be... Yeah, a lot of peer pressure, a lot of herd mentality type of things, like you always see the Democrats doing.
[00:12:40.444 --> 00:12:52.387]  Well, I think it could hurt Hillary real bad, because as we were talking about earlier on the Infowars program with Alex, the Martin O'Malley small percentage, they're not going to be able to stay in their little corner.
[00:12:52.447 --> 00:12:56.748]  They've got to either go home or decide to caucus for Bernie or Hillary.
[00:12:56.808 --> 00:12:59.869]  And I think the majority of Martin O'Malley support will go to Bernie.
[00:13:00.309 --> 00:13:02.690]  And then not even talking about the undecided.
[00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:08.596]  I think the undecided, you know, if they're undecided at this point, then, you know, they're not liking Hillary.
[00:13:08.656 --> 00:13:17.686]  So I think the majority of undecided, after it's all said and done, the majority of undecided and the Martin Amali faction, I think it's going to go to Bernie.
[00:13:17.786 --> 00:13:20.449]  That could just be what Bernie needs to put him over.
[00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.932]  And wow, wouldn't that be something?
[00:13:22.952 --> 00:13:24.113]  I think we're going to see a
[00:13:25.434 --> 00:13:26.995]  I think we're going to see a shakeup in Iowa.
[00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:30.997]  I think Hillary is going to make it out of Iowa as the victor.
[00:13:31.037 --> 00:13:32.138]  I think she'll be number two.
[00:13:32.618 --> 00:13:41.523]  It'll be interesting because if she loses Iowa and she's quite a bit behind in New Hampshire, even if she wins in South Carolina, that starts to take momentum away from her.
[00:13:41.963 --> 00:13:49.347]  Even if she wins that, I mean, if we wind up with Sanders and Trump, Bloomberg has promised that he will come into the race.
[00:13:49.367 --> 00:13:51.348]  So then things will really start to get crazy.
[00:13:51.729 --> 00:13:51.989]  Wow.
[00:13:52.842 --> 00:13:59.068]  Now that you bring that up, I mean, it's too bad I'm in this location because what I would do right now is I would just do my Bob Barker imitation.
[00:13:59.288 --> 00:14:00.009]  The price is right.
[00:14:02.452 --> 00:14:03.493]  That's right, yeah, that's right.
[00:14:03.833 --> 00:14:19.462]  So to get a sense of it then, you would say then that looks like from what you're seeing there at that school that there's heavy turnout because they were concerned in some places there was going to be heavy weather with blizzard or whatever and it's very dependent on the turnout as to which candidates look to do well.
[00:14:19.522 --> 00:14:22.664]  Many people think that Trump and Sanders will benefit from a heavy turnout.
[00:14:24.293 --> 00:14:28.236]  Well, it looks like the weather's held off, at least here, getting to West Des Moines.
[00:14:28.857 --> 00:14:34.981]  It's 33 degrees, foggy, but not any real precipitation, just a little bit of foggy mist.
[00:14:35.522 --> 00:14:50.073]  Now, in western Iowa, potentially where that front's coming in from, from the Omaha-Nebraska direction, they're supposed to see this front first, and I haven't tracked the status of that front, but potentially in western Iowa, there's a little bit of a problem.
[00:14:51.897 --> 00:14:55.678]  Probably at least three-quarters to two-thirds of the state should be good to go.
[00:14:55.718 --> 00:14:59.079]  There shouldn't be any problems as far as people getting to their caucus locations.
[00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:04.180]  So is Western Iowa, is that more of a rural area or an urban area?
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.840]  Do they have large cities over there?
[00:15:07.201 --> 00:15:09.501]  Western Iowa is definitely more rural.
[00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:12.002]  As a matter of fact, I was... Is that too loud?
[00:15:12.998 --> 00:15:14.239]  Okay, they're saying I'm too loud.
[00:15:14.759 --> 00:15:18.141]  Eastern Iowa is populated.
[00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:22.663]  For instance, I was staying in Iowa City, and you've got more cities there.
[00:15:22.863 --> 00:15:28.406]  So basically, Eastern Iowa is more populated, but it's all important.
[00:15:28.426 --> 00:15:29.186]  It's all critical.
[00:15:30.026 --> 00:15:30.827]  Well, that's very interesting.
[00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:37.210]  Thank you, Richard, and I know that they're trying to get things underway there, and they're concerned about how loud you're going to be.
[00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.492]  So we're going to give a little bit of a break there and get back to you in a few minutes.
[00:15:42.688 --> 00:15:43.148]  Very good.
[00:15:43.268 --> 00:15:43.548]  Thank you.
[00:15:43.908 --> 00:15:44.389]  Thank you, Richard.
[00:15:44.809 --> 00:15:47.149]  I guess on the Democratic side, it might be louder over there.
[00:15:47.169 --> 00:15:47.810]  Yeah.
[00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:48.570]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:49.970]  They're probably yelling at each other over there.
[00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:50.110]  Yeah.
[00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.651]  It'll be a little more... It'll be very animated.
[00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:54.892]  I would like to see what's going on with the Democrat side.
[00:15:54.932 --> 00:15:56.212]  I wonder if it would be difficult to get over there.
[00:15:56.232 --> 00:15:58.093]  I can't really envision what that's like.
[00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:00.694]  Let's go to our own Darren McBreen.
[00:16:00.734 --> 00:16:02.954]  He is at the station monitoring things.
[00:16:02.974 --> 00:16:04.395]  Darren, are you looking at social media?
[00:16:05.219 --> 00:16:05.780]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.788]  Darren McBrain once again from our Twitter booth here at the Infowars.com studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:16:11.068 --> 00:16:20.162]  For the next couple of hours, I will be monitoring Twitter and Facebook, as well as keeping a close eye on basically social media's reaction to the Iowa caucus.
[00:16:20.723 --> 00:16:24.886]  Once again, as usual, the talk of the town is all about Donald Trump.
[00:16:24.966 --> 00:16:28.568]  So we're going to have to, we're going to find out whether his gamble is going to pay off.
[00:16:28.628 --> 00:16:32.710]  We all know that last week he boycotted the debate on Fox News.
[00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:39.834]  And as a result, the mainstream media is basically saying he's a runaway, or he's a loose cannon, is what they called him.
[00:16:40.454 --> 00:16:47.599]  And also, what's going to be very interesting is the Democrat side, the race towards socialism continues.
[00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:52.841]  And Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are pretty much neck and neck right now.
[00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:57.843]  However, we did find out from Hillary's friends at Microsoft, they have already declared her the winner.
[00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:00.885]  So we're going to find out what happens there, but should be interesting.
[00:17:01.445 --> 00:17:06.827]  Typically, the Iowa caucus, it kind of foreshadows who's going to be our next president.
[00:17:06.847 --> 00:17:10.749]  But not only that, it thins the herd as well, because there will be less candidates.
[00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:14.631]  Because what happens, those who get beaten really bad or pull the lowest,
[00:17:15.091 --> 00:17:19.495]  They tend to drop out of the presidential race as a result of the Iowa caucus.
[00:17:19.535 --> 00:17:25.920]  So after tonight and the next couple of days, we're about to find out who's going to be among the real presidential frontrunners.
[00:17:26.501 --> 00:17:28.563]  I think it's good we have a chance to thin out the herd.
[00:17:28.663 --> 00:17:35.689]  We do all these debates, we've got to go through each candidate and talk about all their disqualifiers.
[00:17:35.709 --> 00:17:38.952]  So if we can narrow it down just a few, I think that would help a whole lot.
[00:17:39.602 --> 00:17:44.988]  Well, as many people have said, I think it was originally the Des Moines Register said there's three tickets out of Iowa.
[00:17:45.028 --> 00:17:46.090]  We heard Huckabee say that.
[00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.892]  I don't think he's going to be one of the three.
[00:17:48.592 --> 00:17:49.534]  He's way down.
[00:17:49.574 --> 00:17:54.179]  But of course, the top three appear to be Trump, Cruz and Rubio with
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.262]  Rand Paul moving up quite a bit this last week.
[00:17:58.302 --> 00:18:03.446]  It looks like the fact that Donald Trump skipped this last debate really seemed to help Rand Paul.
[00:18:03.486 --> 00:18:14.453]  First, it moved him up considerably in the polls when he was left out of that first debate because he utilized that time very wisely to take questions on social media.
[00:18:15.033 --> 00:18:20.699]  And to talk about issues in a thoughtful way that would not be allowed in a debate.
[00:18:20.819 --> 00:18:25.043]  As sad as that is, the debates really don't cover much in terms of issues.
[00:18:25.103 --> 00:18:28.266]  They don't allow... What's your favorite fantasy football team?
[00:18:28.406 --> 00:18:29.207]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:29.227 --> 00:18:34.492]  They don't allow the candidates to get out of this really tiny, narrowly defined set of issues that they talk about.
[00:18:34.832 --> 00:18:38.016]  Not only every election cycle, but every one of the debates.
[00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:39.497]  Tell us what your tax plan is going to be.
[00:18:39.837 --> 00:18:42.559]  Tell us what the levels are and the rates are and so forth and so on.
[00:18:42.819 --> 00:18:43.960]  And they all brag about that.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.963]  If they're a governor, they brag about how many jobs they personally created in the state.
[00:18:48.003 --> 00:18:52.926]  It's just absolute idiocy and they do it every single debate, every single cycle.
[00:18:53.246 --> 00:18:58.310]  And so it was very good for him to break out of that and to talk to people directly about issues.
[00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:14.436]  So he had a bump in the poll then, and then when Trump set out this last debate, it allowed a more serious discussion of some issues because Trump wasn't dominating the debate as he always does, and so Rand Paul was able to talk about some of the issues.
[00:19:14.496 --> 00:19:23.579]  So with those two turns of events, he's moved up in the polls where I'm certainly hopeful that he's going to have a stronger showing in this, because I would like to see somebody
[00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:34.882]  He was talking about genuine libertarian issues, things like controlling the surveillance state, not setting up suicidal World War III triggers all around the world with no-fly zones.
[00:19:34.902 --> 00:19:40.744]  He's the only one who has any sense in the Republican Party in terms of the no-fly zones.
[00:19:40.884 --> 00:19:47.687]  Donald Trump is a little bit hesitant about that kind of setting on the fence, but only Rand Paul says this is madness.
[00:19:47.747 --> 00:19:50.067]  This is Dr. Strangelove-level madness.
[00:19:50.087 --> 00:19:52.048]  The other guys just want to rush full-on.
[00:19:52.128 --> 00:19:56.191]  They don't think that Obama has done enough in terms of the number of wars that we've gotten ourselves involved in.
[00:19:56.211 --> 00:19:59.433]  Well, they want to make sure that the military-industrial complex is well-fed.
[00:19:59.893 --> 00:20:00.234]  That's right.
[00:20:00.614 --> 00:20:13.463]  And so that's one of the things that has hurt Rand Paul, is that he's really kind of a man without a country, in a sense, because a non-interventionist foreign policy is not something that sells well in either party.
[00:20:13.943 --> 00:20:18.528]  Both parties really want to have a war, really war parties with that.
[00:20:18.548 --> 00:20:21.871]  But he also looks at the war on drugs issue and so forth and so on.
[00:20:21.891 --> 00:20:24.453]  Now, we look at what's going on with Trump and Cruz.
[00:20:24.493 --> 00:20:32.001]  I think it's interesting that first Cruz, in terms of, he's come out very strongly against ethanol subsidies, okay?
[00:20:32.541 --> 00:20:38.385]  And, of course, ethanol is making alcohol that goes into your gasoline out of corn.
[00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:41.748]  And Iowa is one of the places where they make a lot of money out of that.
[00:20:41.768 --> 00:20:47.052]  So the Iowa governor was essentially un-endorsed Cruz.
[00:20:47.252 --> 00:20:49.994]  He didn't endorse anybody, but he said, anybody but Cruz.
[00:20:50.234 --> 00:20:52.535]  Because he's going to destroy our ethanol business.
[00:20:52.575 --> 00:20:56.999]  And, of course, The Hill reports that Trump warns Iowans Cruz will destroy your ethanol business.
[00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:58.880]  He says he'll destroy your ethanol business 100%.
[00:21:00.481 --> 00:21:02.823]  The oil people are funding him, and they don't want ethanol.
[00:21:02.843 --> 00:21:10.089]  Your ethanol business, if Ted Cruz gets in the White House, will be wiped out within six months to a year, the ethanol business.
[00:21:10.129 --> 00:21:14.213]  So, you know, that's one area where actually I think Ted Cruz is right.
[00:21:14.693 --> 00:21:16.315]  Okay, but then he turns around.
[00:21:16.895 --> 00:21:30.722]  And because that puts him at odds with Big Agra in Iowa, he comes out and he throws the speech out about GMOs saying, don't let anti-science zealotry shut down GMOs.
[00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:35.864]  So he's out there trying to win back the support of Big Agra.
[00:21:36.085 --> 00:21:39.346]  Absolutely amazing what he says about GMOs.
[00:21:39.366 --> 00:21:42.688]  He says, people who oppose GMOs want to buy organic food can do that.
[00:21:42.748 --> 00:21:44.929]  Well, not if you have the DARK Act.
[00:21:45.089 --> 00:21:45.349]  Right.
[00:21:45.389 --> 00:21:47.771]  It shuts down your knowledge of what's in this product.
[00:21:48.011 --> 00:21:48.612]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:48.632 --> 00:21:50.113]  And he is right.
[00:21:50.153 --> 00:21:53.595]  It is a science project, so it's right in that sense.
[00:21:53.655 --> 00:22:02.601]  What they have done is they've had to fight state-by-state, community-by-community to try to keep GMOs even though people really don't want them.
[00:22:02.962 --> 00:22:04.703]  It's not something people are clamoring about.
[00:22:04.983 --> 00:22:07.484]  Hey, could you genetically alter our food?
[00:22:07.504 --> 00:22:17.427]  They at least want to know about it, because we've seen the initiative shot down in places like California, and the excuse is, well, it's going to cost all this millions of dollars to repackage the food.
[00:22:17.767 --> 00:22:22.549]  Every time you have a big bowl game or you have a new movie come out in the summertime, they repackage the stuff anyway.
[00:22:22.929 --> 00:22:25.070]  So how hard is it just to put a little sticker on there?
[00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:29.731]  And it's not like it's going to make people who are just going to eat whatever they want anyway.
[00:22:29.911 --> 00:22:34.073]  On the McDonald's drive-thru windows in California, it says right there on the window,
[00:22:34.973 --> 00:22:35.553]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:22:51.718 --> 00:23:02.223]  Where they came in and they said, we are going to ban the growing of GMO in our community because it's going to cross-pollinate onto our crops that we're trying to grow that are not GMO.
[00:23:02.243 --> 00:23:04.864]  We're trying to grow a healthy premium product here.
[00:23:05.164 --> 00:23:06.145]  So they shut it down there.
[00:23:06.445 --> 00:23:09.206]  They have tried to shut it down with labeling at various state levels.
[00:23:09.246 --> 00:23:19.771]  And so what the industry has done is to go to Washington and say, we want you to pass this act that will prohibit states from making any kind of regulation about labeling of food.
[00:23:20.711 --> 00:23:21.292]  At that level.
[00:23:21.512 --> 00:23:31.577]  Essentially shutting down the 9th and 10th Amendment so we can make this, put this stuff into the food and not tell people that it's there because we think if we tell them they're not going to want to buy this food.
[00:23:31.597 --> 00:23:31.897]  Right.
[00:23:31.917 --> 00:23:33.278]  And that is fundamentally dishonest.
[00:23:33.298 --> 00:23:36.200]  And of course they're not even going to stop at the national level.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.441]  They want to go to the international level.
[00:23:38.481 --> 00:23:43.143]  That's a key component of these trade partnership treaties that are about to be run through.
[00:23:43.544 --> 00:23:49.387]  And we can talk about how things are going to change one way or the other depending on who gets elected as we look at some of these issues.
[00:23:50.027 --> 00:24:04.497]  When you look at this and you look at what Ted Cruz is saying, I mean he is simply out there for this particular special interest group and another special interest group and that's why all the big money is moving to Rubio and Cruz as Jeb Bush is biting the dust.
[00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:06.998]  It's really interesting to watch.
[00:24:07.038 --> 00:24:12.882]  And of course, you know, you're speaking about those international tribunals there with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:24:12.942 --> 00:24:20.386]  So if you're a country that decides you don't want genetically modified foods, well then now companies like Monsanto or Dow Syngenta can sue you.
[00:24:20.406 --> 00:24:21.487]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:21.747 --> 00:24:23.008]  And bankrupt your country.
[00:24:23.168 --> 00:24:32.211]  You know, various type of fast food companies overseas, even if they're chains that started here or have offices here overseas, they don't have the same type of things that we have in our food here.
[00:24:32.231 --> 00:24:32.832]  Mexican Coke.
[00:24:33.032 --> 00:24:33.212]  Yeah.
[00:24:33.252 --> 00:24:33.592]  Look at that.
[00:24:33.612 --> 00:24:34.392]  Yeah, Mexican Coke.
[00:24:34.412 --> 00:24:35.373]  That's a perfect example.
[00:24:35.393 --> 00:24:37.453]  They don't put it in plastic containers with BPA.
[00:24:37.493 --> 00:24:38.634]  They put it in a glass container.
[00:24:38.674 --> 00:24:40.375]  They don't put in high fructose corn syrup.
[00:24:40.635 --> 00:24:41.855]  They put in real sugar.
[00:24:41.955 --> 00:24:42.155]  Yes.
[00:24:42.255 --> 00:24:42.575]  Okay.
[00:24:42.735 --> 00:24:42.895]  Right.
[00:24:43.316 --> 00:24:45.577]  And so there's some other stuff in there that's not too good for you.
[00:24:45.677 --> 00:24:51.799]  Chocolate, you know, chocolate from other countries is so good, but here it's got a weird chemical taste to it.
[00:24:52.219 --> 00:25:04.222]  But when we talk about GMOs, the things that concern people about it, concern them in terms of destroying our food supply as well as what other things are going to be introducing into it, it's not simply selective breeding.
[00:25:04.242 --> 00:25:07.542]  And I think there's a lot of confusion about people, with people on that, okay?
[00:25:07.582 --> 00:25:12.963]  The science of genetic manipulation of this is one of transgenic manipulation.
[00:25:13.023 --> 00:25:14.164]  It is not selective breeding.
[00:25:14.184 --> 00:25:16.384]  We've done that with plants and animals for a very long time.
[00:25:16.404 --> 00:25:20.045]  That's how we get all the different breeds of dogs and cats that are so specialized.
[00:25:20.805 --> 00:25:24.107]  But this is about taking something that is completely foreign.
[00:25:24.267 --> 00:25:32.752]  This is about taking a chemical and mixing it into the corn so that instead of having to spray the chemicals on it, you can put the chemicals in it systemically.
[00:25:32.812 --> 00:25:33.492]  Things like that.
[00:25:34.433 --> 00:25:41.217]  Or creating a system where it will withstand the poisons that they spray on it in terms of pesticides.
[00:25:42.238 --> 00:25:43.318]  But it'll kill everything else.
[00:25:43.338 --> 00:25:53.144]  So they use these herbicides and then they genetically modify this particular corn, let's say, so that it will not be killed by this herbicide that kills everything else that's green.
[00:25:53.184 --> 00:25:55.666]  Right, so the bugs that eat it, their stomachs will explode.
[00:25:56.026 --> 00:26:00.249]  And then, no, there's no tie into why everyone has all these gastrointestinal issues.
[00:26:00.469 --> 00:26:01.931]  They're not concerned about the health effects.
[00:26:01.951 --> 00:26:08.638]  They're concerned about the fact that, hey, we can sell them this corn, which is patented, will not reproduce, that they have to buy from us each year.
[00:26:08.998 --> 00:26:12.723]  And then we can also sell them this pesticide and those two things together.
[00:26:12.763 --> 00:26:13.864]  So it's all about profit.
[00:26:13.884 --> 00:26:15.646]  There's absolutely no interest in health.
[00:26:15.686 --> 00:26:20.431]  And to call this, call opposition to this, anti-science zealotry.
[00:26:20.531 --> 00:26:21.833]  No, what you're doing, Ted,
[00:26:22.413 --> 00:26:26.918]  You're preying on the ignorance of people and you're doing it for big agro.
[00:26:26.958 --> 00:26:28.640]  Let's be honest about what's going on here.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.824]  That's basically being out there for sale just like Hillary Clinton.
[00:26:32.964 --> 00:26:43.275]  Right, and it's also too we think that those farmers who have been duped into turning their entire farms into selling genetically modified corn and other crops, they're in it now.
[00:26:43.755 --> 00:26:49.124]  So in order to save the country and save our farmers, now they have to save this GMO.
[00:26:49.444 --> 00:26:51.347]  We've seen examples of this overseas.
[00:26:51.407 --> 00:26:58.578]  I believe it was in India where the farmers over there were using Monsanto products and they eventually committed suicide by drinking the Monsanto products.
[00:26:58.939 --> 00:27:00.500]  But nobody wants to take that seriously.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.763]  They don't use that as an example or a template or a cautionary tale.
[00:27:03.783 --> 00:27:05.225]  It's like, oh, it just happened over there.
[00:27:05.285 --> 00:27:05.845]  It will never happen.
[00:27:05.865 --> 00:27:16.294]  Because what happens is, because of the monopoly that they set up, what they did in India and what they will do here if they get the chance to do it, is to turn the farmers into sharecroppers.
[00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:17.595]  It's just that simple.
[00:27:18.016 --> 00:27:24.201]  They're going to get the lion's share of the control and profits, and they're going to squeeze these guys to death.
[00:27:24.261 --> 00:27:26.003]  And that's what all the big corporations do.
[00:27:26.443 --> 00:27:39.912]  I mean, whether you're talking about, you know, the movie studios squeezing the video stores out of business and squeezing the movie chains out of business where they don't get any money except for the popcorn and cold drinks that they sell.
[00:27:39.932 --> 00:27:40.432]  Pretty much, yeah.
[00:27:40.452 --> 00:27:40.692]  Okay.
[00:27:41.132 --> 00:27:41.833]  That's it.
[00:27:41.933 --> 00:27:47.276]  I mean, it is this monopolist mindset where they will not allow anyone to make any money except them.
[00:27:47.316 --> 00:27:50.078]  And as soon as they see there's another penny on the table, they want that.
[00:27:50.118 --> 00:27:54.201]  I mean, it's unmitigated greed and they don't care about who they shut down.
[00:27:54.221 --> 00:27:54.321]  Right.
[00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:57.563]  That's what's behind all these issues that we were out in Oregon looking at.
[00:27:58.284 --> 00:28:02.647]  That is fundamentally the endgame there, and that's what's going on with these trade partnerships.
[00:28:02.667 --> 00:28:08.391]  Let's talk about the trade partnerships for a while, and we can talk about what happens if some of these people, when these guys win.
[00:28:08.672 --> 00:28:12.535]  I mean, who is going to support the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and who's going to oppose it?
[00:28:14.227 --> 00:28:15.128]  Let's put it this way.
[00:28:15.168 --> 00:28:19.310]  Who is going to oppose it, as far as the way you look at this?
[00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.492]  I can see that Rand Paul appears to be opposing it.
[00:28:22.532 --> 00:28:27.555]  He opposed at least the process that said, this is not a treaty, let's fast track it.
[00:28:27.755 --> 00:28:31.196]  And he said, wait a minute, this has been done in secret, there's no reason we should shut down.
[00:28:31.557 --> 00:28:35.139]  The ability to offer amendments to it after we see it.
[00:28:35.379 --> 00:28:38.220]  It was a very raw deal in terms of that process.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.581]  He voted against that.
[00:28:39.701 --> 00:28:43.604]  Well similar to what we've seen Pelosi say, you have to pass it so you can find out what's in it.
[00:28:43.744 --> 00:28:45.386]  Yeah, and that turned out so great.
[00:28:45.766 --> 00:28:56.635]  And of course Hillary, for years and many votes, she was very much for the Trans-Pacific Partnership until just, I don't know, maybe 6-7 months ago she finally said, oh well I've changed my mind.
[00:28:57.415 --> 00:29:01.178]  After it was already all, the fast track was authorized.
[00:29:01.258 --> 00:29:02.880]  Yeah, we know that she's going to change that.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.321]  As a matter of fact, we've got a clip of Hillary.
[00:29:04.801 --> 00:29:10.423]  Talking about how she cannot be bought, and we should play that here, but I think that is something where she's going to flip that position.
[00:29:11.224 --> 00:29:13.925]  Bernie Sanders, I believe, says he's against the TPP.
[00:29:15.025 --> 00:29:22.168]  Again, as I said, Rand Paul, I'm not really sure how he's going to vote on the TPP, but he voted both times it was up against the TPA.
[00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:25.670]  The other senators who are running, Rubio, voted both times for it.
[00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:36.095]  And that is essentially a vote to subvert the constitutional process by saying, this isn't a treaty, we don't need to have two-thirds of the senators vote for it, we're just going to have a simple up-and-down vote.
[00:29:36.656 --> 00:29:42.559]  And then we had Ted Cruz, who has been for it before he was against it, as they would say.
[00:29:42.679 --> 00:29:44.760]  Okay, so he's been on both sides of this issue.
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.722]  He did not oppose it on principle, constitutional principle, saying, wait a minute,
[00:29:48.942 --> 00:29:52.163]  There's a process in the Constitution by which we ratify treaties.
[00:29:52.923 --> 00:29:54.844]  He didn't oppose it because it was secret.
[00:29:54.884 --> 00:29:56.564]  It had something to do with the Ex-Im Bank.
[00:29:56.664 --> 00:30:00.786]  And he came in at the last minute and changed his vote because his vote really didn't matter.
[00:30:00.806 --> 00:30:02.246]  They had so many votes, they could pass it.
[00:30:02.566 --> 00:30:05.047]  But this of course is... Just like not showing up there for the Audit the Fed bill.
[00:30:05.387 --> 00:30:05.887]  Exactly.
[00:30:06.107 --> 00:30:06.487]  Exactly.
[00:30:06.527 --> 00:30:11.529]  This is what Hillary says about whether or not she will be able to be bought by the bankers.
[00:30:12.423 --> 00:30:20.305]  Campaign trail, how do you answer that charge that Senator Sanders has made that you're in the pocket of Wall Street or beholden to their interests?
[00:30:22.466 --> 00:30:29.667]  Well, look, anybody who knows me knows I'm not in the pocket of anyone and anyone who thinks they can hit me doesn't know me.
[00:30:30.468 --> 00:30:39.870]  But what I do think is interesting is I've laid out the most comprehensive, toughest, effective plan to make sure Wall Street never wrecks Main Street again.
[00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:41.931]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:44.952]  That's what Paul Krugman and Barney Frank and others have said.
[00:30:45.452 --> 00:30:52.495]  But the really interesting part of this is how the Republicans have now been running about six million dollars of ads against me.
[00:30:52.515 --> 00:30:54.856]  Yeah, of course, she can't be bought, right?
[00:30:54.876 --> 00:30:56.677]  But of course, we had Donald Trump.
[00:30:56.717 --> 00:30:58.218]  He said, she was at your wedding.
[00:30:58.718 --> 00:30:59.678]  I paid her to be there.
[00:31:00.219 --> 00:31:03.340]  And she came back and said, well, I didn't buy him a gift.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.901]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[00:31:04.921 --> 00:31:06.802]  It makes it all better.
[00:31:06.822 --> 00:31:08.483]  That was one of the best put-downs I've ever heard.
[00:31:08.523 --> 00:31:12.125]  I mean, it's like saying, you know, I hired her to sing or whatever.
[00:31:12.145 --> 00:31:14.546]  She was part of the paid staff, the entertainment.
[00:31:14.626 --> 00:31:15.487]  I hired her to be there.
[00:31:16.067 --> 00:31:19.409]  And of course, you know, we know that she is available.
[00:31:19.609 --> 00:31:23.812]  She may not be able to be sold, she may not be for sale, but she can be rented by the hour.
[00:31:24.315 --> 00:31:32.665]  Well, she's made millions of dollars in speaking fees for banks, where she's given speeches that aren't even an hour long, makes millions of dollars.
[00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:41.236]  And we've got this article up, I believe Steve Watson wrote it, that she received six million dollars from Soros last month.
[00:31:41.949 --> 00:31:43.090]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:45.511]  I mean, billionaire leftist George Soros gave her $6 million.
[00:31:45.531 --> 00:31:46.512]  But she can't be bought.
[00:31:46.912 --> 00:31:48.073]  Right, no, she can't be bought.
[00:31:48.453 --> 00:31:50.514]  He's not the man behind the curtain.
[00:31:50.554 --> 00:31:54.656]  I wonder, you know, if $6 million doesn't do it, I really wonder what her price tag is.
[00:31:54.676 --> 00:31:57.958]  You know, as they say, we're just haggling over the price.
[00:31:57.998 --> 00:31:59.199]  No, it's not just her.
[00:31:59.219 --> 00:32:00.319]  We've seen Bill as well.
[00:32:00.379 --> 00:32:02.000]  They get paid these outrageous fees.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.401]  You know, he goes overseas.
[00:32:03.581 --> 00:32:07.904]  Sometimes they give the speeches, as Leanne alluded to, are very short in length.
[00:32:08.504 --> 00:32:12.105]  Yeah, I would say that these guys can be bought off.
[00:32:12.125 --> 00:32:15.786]  $125 million in speaking fees since they, her and her husband, have left the White House.
[00:32:16.146 --> 00:32:16.326]  Yeah.
[00:32:16.406 --> 00:32:17.526]  When they were dead broke.
[00:32:17.706 --> 00:32:20.567]  Yeah, dead broke when they left.
[00:32:20.587 --> 00:32:24.968]  Yeah, just give a few, and we haven't gotten any returns coming out.
[00:32:24.988 --> 00:32:32.150]  We should be getting returns in pretty soon, about 7.30 is when they said they thought they would start to collect these.
[00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:37.591]  Have we heard anything from Richard in terms of, I was wondering if he could get into the Democratic caucus.
[00:32:37.651 --> 00:32:38.011]  I'd like to.
[00:32:39.304 --> 00:32:40.887]  You guys can talk to him.
[00:32:40.907 --> 00:32:46.598]  See if he can mosey over to the Democrat caucus because it might be more cacophonous.
[00:32:48.427 --> 00:32:53.031]  So, let's, we had some interesting things from Rand Paul when he was here.
[00:32:53.051 --> 00:33:00.438]  And of course, in Iowa, the Republicans, it's very, the Republican Party is very small compared to the Democrat Party.
[00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:06.784]  And the Republican Party there, the small Republican Party, is very heavily influenced by the Christian wing.
[00:33:06.844 --> 00:33:10.667]  And so we've seen candidates like Pat Robertson do really well there.
[00:33:10.707 --> 00:33:13.170]  We had Mike Huckabee win there in the past.
[00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:14.131]  And so that's a large
[00:33:14.631 --> 00:33:15.191]  Voting Bloc.
[00:33:45.191 --> 00:33:46.011]  Who would this be?
[00:33:46.031 --> 00:33:47.132]  The reality TV star.
[00:33:47.152 --> 00:33:50.413]  I looked at this and of course that was Phil Robertson from Duck Dynasty.
[00:33:50.433 --> 00:33:51.853]  I was going to say Duck Dynasty.
[00:33:51.913 --> 00:33:52.954]  Okay, here's your guess here.
[00:33:53.014 --> 00:33:55.294]  Who do you think the disgraced Fox News pundit was?
[00:33:56.595 --> 00:33:58.515]  Oh, I can't.
[00:33:58.535 --> 00:33:59.055]  Dan Rather.
[00:33:59.655 --> 00:34:00.896]  Glenn Beck.
[00:34:01.776 --> 00:34:07.598]  I was trying to think of one that was at some famous event and wasn't there.
[00:34:07.698 --> 00:34:09.458]  One guy has a beard and one guy is a beard.
[00:34:11.894 --> 00:34:13.777]  That's the two that they had there.
[00:34:13.817 --> 00:34:14.578]  Wow, interesting.
[00:34:14.899 --> 00:34:19.245]  Yeah, so Beck has been strongly in Cruz's stand.
[00:34:19.406 --> 00:34:24.373]  But one of the things that they talked about here, which I thought was a pretty good way to put it, was biblical correctness.
[00:34:24.914 --> 00:34:26.737]  You know, kind of like political correctness.
[00:34:27.077 --> 00:34:34.343]  And of course, everybody is trying to put themselves out there and trying to relate to the Christians by quoting Bible verses and that sort of thing.
[00:34:34.423 --> 00:34:36.324]  And that's, I think, transparently phony.
[00:34:36.384 --> 00:34:39.547]  Especially, you know, when Donald Trump says two Corinthians.
[00:34:40.047 --> 00:34:41.849]  But what offended me far more than that...
[00:34:42.594 --> 00:34:46.435]  Was the fact that Ted Cruz would basically troll him on that.
[00:34:46.455 --> 00:35:01.741]  And I gotta say, as a Christian, that offended me so deeply to see him mocking someone who obviously, you know, everything that Donald Trump says makes me believe that he hasn't really got much of an understanding or relationship with Christ.
[00:35:02.161 --> 00:35:04.782]  He talks about how he doesn't need forgiveness, but when I hear that,
[00:35:05.402 --> 00:35:07.883]  It makes me feel sorry for him as a human being.
[00:35:08.023 --> 00:35:12.824]  You know, part of the Bible says, what does it profit a man to gain the entire world and lose his own soul?
[00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:16.625]  And so that makes me feel very sorry for Donald Trump, the man.
[00:35:17.185 --> 00:35:20.066]  And I would never poke fun at somebody.
[00:35:20.086 --> 00:35:32.709]  If I'm a Christian, Ted Cruz wants to tell everybody his daddy's a pastor, and he's a Christian, and he's going to poke fun at somebody who says two Corinthians, then I have to say, you know, you're going full Elmer Gantry
[00:35:33.499 --> 00:35:39.884]  Mr. Cruz, you know, this is using your Christianity to try to get people to vote for you.
[00:35:39.964 --> 00:35:53.694]  And I have seen Christians taken advantage of so many times by people who parade their Christianity out there trying to sell something, whether it's a car or whether it's themselves, trying to parade that out there and use it as a con.
[00:35:54.295 --> 00:35:57.357]  Let's hear what Rand Paul had to say with the Christian clip.
[00:35:58.843 --> 00:36:03.686]  Hey, before we go to that clip, guys, we've got some text updates from Richard out on the road.
[00:36:04.006 --> 00:36:11.370]  He's saying that there were no speakers for the caucuses for Fiorina or Kasich, but there were big applauses for Rand Paul.
[00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:12.410]  Really?
[00:36:13.011 --> 00:36:15.852]  And that the results of this caucus that they're at now,
[00:36:19.341 --> 00:36:23.162]  Won't be taken until all the candidate representatives have spoken.
[00:36:23.582 --> 00:36:24.342]  Okay, alright.
[00:36:24.782 --> 00:36:28.163]  But there's nobody speaking for Carly Fiorina and who else?
[00:36:28.523 --> 00:36:28.903]  Kasich.
[00:36:29.103 --> 00:36:29.483]  Kasich.
[00:36:29.723 --> 00:36:32.364]  And perhaps if we look at this poll... No speaker for Santorum as well.
[00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:34.385]  No speaker for Santorum.
[00:36:34.445 --> 00:36:36.745]  Yeah, he's less than half a percent.
[00:36:36.825 --> 00:36:38.806]  I mean, he is flatlining big time.
[00:36:39.046 --> 00:36:40.606]  This is the guy who won last time!
[00:36:41.026 --> 00:36:42.406]  We're supposed to believe, right?
[00:36:42.687 --> 00:36:43.907]  I never believed
[00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:48.534]  That Santorum won the night before they held the caucus in 2012.
[00:36:50.123 --> 00:37:05.797]  Everybody was laughing about the fact that Rick Santorum went with his crew and a TV crew into a bar and everybody, first of all, most of the people didn't know who he was, the people who might have known, they were all telling him, sit down, shut up, you're in the way, we want to watch the game, get out of here.
[00:37:05.817 --> 00:37:13.384]  I mean, there was nobody that was the least bit interested in him the night before and we're supposed to believe that he won when he had these massive crowds for Ron Paul showing up?
[00:37:13.464 --> 00:37:16.147]  I mean, it was just, I thought it was just absolutely criminal last time.
[00:37:17.429 --> 00:37:22.313]  If we go to these polls here, can you open it up to where it shows all the results?
[00:37:22.353 --> 00:37:24.815]  Because they're only going to show their favored three.
[00:37:24.835 --> 00:37:26.136]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[00:37:26.156 --> 00:37:28.398]  They're only going to show, yeah.
[00:37:29.659 --> 00:37:32.481]  Well, it's a little bit early, so we're not really going to have much in terms of that.
[00:37:32.521 --> 00:37:36.324]  Let's hear what Rand Paul said in terms of this Christian quote here.
[00:37:37.113 --> 00:37:59.285]  You know, I think one of the things about the disconnect between the grassroots and, you know, the establishment Washington Republicans is, I put forward an amendment about a year or so ago and I said that we shouldn't give any foreign aid to any countries that persecute Christians, any countries that put to death Christians who interfaith marriage or people who convert from Islam to Christianity.
[00:38:00.045 --> 00:38:04.066]  If they have laws on their books that says you are put to death, they shouldn't get any of our money.
[00:38:04.466 --> 00:38:10.147]  I've yet to meet one American outside of Washington who is opposed to my amendment.
[00:38:10.487 --> 00:38:20.269]  And yet in Washington, when we voted on it, 18 senators voted to continue sending foreign aid, even if the laws of the country we were giving the money to were to persecute Christians.
[00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:26.090]  And so that, I think, just shows you how far apart we are, the grassroots from those in Washington.
[00:38:26.877 --> 00:38:28.198]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:38:28.698 --> 00:38:34.503]  Common sense in America would say, if they're going to be executing Christians, and let's put a name to that, okay?
[00:38:34.843 --> 00:38:37.405]  Saudi Arabia, okay?
[00:38:37.545 --> 00:38:47.053]  If they're going to be cutting the heads off of Christians, if they're going to be using all kinds of brutal things against people who are visiting their country,
[00:38:47.233 --> 00:39:02.026]  Pumping out their oil, making the money for these lazy sheiks, turning them into multi-gazillionaires, and then they have the audacity to persecute people who have Bibles for their own use, and what they've done to other people.
[00:39:02.166 --> 00:39:03.887]  We shouldn't be giving them any money, let's understand that.
[00:39:03.907 --> 00:39:05.368]  Why do they need our money anyway?
[00:39:05.909 --> 00:39:10.032]  We got poll results from Huffington Post, if you want to check them out.
[00:39:10.313 --> 00:39:11.674]  Yeah, so what do they have?
[00:39:13.149 --> 00:39:17.152]  First of all, when I first walked in here, Trump and Cruz were neck and neck.
[00:39:17.572 --> 00:39:23.776]  And I just refreshed this, and Trump is up 30.7%, and Ted Cruz has dropped down quite a bit.
[00:39:23.796 --> 00:39:27.598]  And this is just the last hour, so it was much closer an hour ago.
[00:39:27.658 --> 00:39:30.580]  So it looks like Donald Trump is starting to run away with it.
[00:39:31.061 --> 00:39:35.043]  And Rand Paul doesn't look too good, according to the Huffington Post.
[00:39:35.543 --> 00:39:35.924]  Interesting.
[00:39:36.124 --> 00:39:36.344]  Okay.
[00:39:36.784 --> 00:39:38.885]  Well, I think it's too early for anybody to know.
[00:39:38.965 --> 00:39:41.226]  I don't think that Rand Paul is going to do too well.
[00:39:41.546 --> 00:39:44.748]  I wish he would do better, but we'll have to wait and see what happens.
[00:39:45.028 --> 00:39:47.329]  I do think it's going to be a runaway for Donald Trump with this.
[00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:54.493]  Do you think, David, that Rand Paul made a mistake by going against Donald Trump so much?
[00:39:54.513 --> 00:39:55.273]  Do you think he should have?
[00:39:56.194 --> 00:39:58.875]  I was very much put off by that very first exchange.
[00:39:58.995 --> 00:40:01.937]  I remember when the very first debate, the very first question,
[00:40:02.918 --> 00:40:12.004]  They asked Donald Trump, or they asked everybody, you know, raise your hands, like the kids in the school, raise your hands, would you run as an independent if you don't get the nomination?
[00:40:12.664 --> 00:40:16.147]  And I think it came across really well for Donald Trump.
[00:40:16.207 --> 00:40:18.528]  He was honest about it, so yeah, yeah, who would?
[00:40:18.608 --> 00:40:19.549]  You know, he raised his hand.
[00:40:20.478 --> 00:40:27.864]  With all of that peer pressure there at the, you know, across the stage, he raises his hand and said, yeah, I would if I don't get it.
[00:40:28.204 --> 00:40:29.966]  That's one of the things I respect about the guy.
[00:40:29.986 --> 00:40:33.769]  You know, like I said, there's plenty of things he says that I don't agree with, but I do respect his honesty.
[00:40:33.989 --> 00:40:34.410]  Exactly.
[00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:44.218]  And what I didn't like was Rand Paul immediately getting so upset and screaming across at him, and I looked and was like, why is he that upset about that?
[00:40:44.858 --> 00:40:53.784]  I don't really care about parties, and I thought that one of the things that appealed to me about Ron Paul was that he transcended this kind of party loyalty.
[00:40:54.164 --> 00:40:55.345]  He would talk about issues.
[00:40:55.385 --> 00:40:57.486]  He had issues that were important to him.
[00:40:57.826 --> 00:41:02.530]  He resigned from the Republican Party when they went back against everything that they had promised.
[00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.632]  It was three terms after Ronald Reagan had been elected.
[00:41:05.752 --> 00:41:08.453]  He was very concerned that Ronald Reagan had betrayed the public.
[00:41:08.714 --> 00:41:10.775]  He was going to get rid of the Department of Education.
[00:41:11.075 --> 00:41:13.896]  He was going to balance the budget, he was going to do a lot of things that he didn't do.
[00:41:13.936 --> 00:41:29.503]  And of course, Ron Paul had supported Ronald Reagan in 76 when he lost, supported him again in 1980, but then resigned and was very critical of Ronald Reagan not fulfilling his promises, as we now see over and over again from GOP politicians, as well as the rest of the GOP.
[00:41:29.583 --> 00:41:34.325]  So he resigned, and then two years later he ran as a Libertarian for President.
[00:41:34.905 --> 00:41:41.489]  And he didn't win that, obviously, didn't even come, I think, more than 1%, because it's difficult with a third party.
[00:41:41.989 --> 00:41:48.813]  He eventually got back in as a Republican congressman, but he was not tied up into the party establishment.
[00:41:48.893 --> 00:41:54.456]  And that, when I watched Rand Paul's reaction to that, that really got me concerned about Rand Paul.
[00:41:54.576 --> 00:41:57.438]  Is he willing to sell out his principles for access?
[00:41:58.338 --> 00:41:59.259]  Why is the party?
[00:41:59.799 --> 00:42:02.542]  That important to him and that really concerned me when I saw it.
[00:42:02.562 --> 00:42:04.725]  So I think from the very beginning I was concerned about it.
[00:42:04.745 --> 00:42:06.026]  I don't think Rand Paul is perfect.
[00:42:06.066 --> 00:42:07.448]  I don't think any of these guys are perfect.
[00:42:07.468 --> 00:42:10.772]  I think we need to talk about where they're right on issues and where they're wrong on issues.
[00:42:11.032 --> 00:42:16.739]  He has been the only person who will talk about some issues that I think are vital to this country.
[00:42:17.279 --> 00:42:24.445]  That will determine whether or not we continue to exist as anything that is even remotely recognizable as America.
[00:42:24.485 --> 00:42:27.708]  I don't think we will, quite frankly, because nobody else is talking about it.
[00:42:27.928 --> 00:42:30.050]  When he puts these issues forward, he doesn't get any traction.
[00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:35.294]  Well, the fact that we've got a Democratic Socialist as the frontrunner there, neck and neck with Hillary Clinton.
[00:42:35.314 --> 00:42:35.435]  Yes.
[00:42:36.192 --> 00:42:37.113]  That's pretty shocking.
[00:42:37.793 --> 00:42:42.197]  And the support for Bernie Sanders is predominantly for the young.
[00:42:42.257 --> 00:42:49.383]  They said if you look at the Democrat supporters, it splits between the young and between somebody who identifies themselves as a female.
[00:42:50.063 --> 00:42:51.304]  We have Richard back with us now?
[00:42:53.506 --> 00:42:53.906]  Did you say?
[00:42:53.926 --> 00:42:55.628]  Okay, I guess not.
[00:42:56.764 --> 00:42:57.405]  Um, there he is.
[00:42:57.725 --> 00:42:58.386]  Richard is there.
[00:42:58.426 --> 00:42:59.347]  Okay, let's go back to Richard.
[00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:00.108]  Richard.
[00:43:00.568 --> 00:43:01.009]  Hi, David.
[00:43:01.389 --> 00:43:04.092]  Uh, well, it looks like they've actually finished with all the speakers.
[00:43:04.592 --> 00:43:10.338]  It is hard to hear in the gym because the people administering the event do not have any amplification.
[00:43:10.919 --> 00:43:15.804]  So, any noise in this gym, the acoustics, everything else drowns out the speaker up front.
[00:43:16.324 --> 00:43:27.333]  So therefore obviously we had to be very quiet and then also like I say right now they are physically literally passing out those paper ballots where people are going to fill out and put the name of their candidate.
[00:43:27.913 --> 00:43:35.079]  So I'll tell you what I think within the next probably 15 to 30 minutes we're probably going to have some numbers here from this event.
[00:43:35.739 --> 00:43:37.120]  So it's going to be a very interesting.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:48.550]  I also did hear you talking about Rand Paul earlier and it has been frustrating that Rand Paul hasn't taken an approach that I think would lead him to a higher place in the in the
[00:43:49.411 --> 00:43:49.811]  He did bring that up.
[00:44:15.157 --> 00:44:19.718]  Yeah, he's kind of gone into, he's moderated his dad's positions on a lot of issues.
[00:44:19.818 --> 00:44:29.500]  It's like, yeah, I'm still for, you know, I still understand the issue with the Fed, but let's instead of maybe, you know, ending the Fed, let's audit the Fed and kind of leave it at that.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:35.401]  So, you know, he seems like he's pulled back a little bit there because I think he feels like the Libertarian base has nowhere else to go.
[00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:38.422]  And I think he's unfortunately right about that.
[00:44:39.162 --> 00:44:42.083]  But I think it's also undermined his support with his base as well.
[00:44:42.643 --> 00:44:43.083]  Well, right.
[00:44:43.103 --> 00:44:45.504]  I think he would have had a bigger support, bigger base.
[00:44:45.644 --> 00:44:48.686]  So, yeah, I think that it was a mistake.
[00:44:48.746 --> 00:44:55.268]  I mean, look, he had a heck of a platform last Thursday with Donald Trump leaving the big vacuum.
[00:44:55.628 --> 00:44:57.009]  It was time for Rand Paul.
[00:44:57.089 --> 00:44:58.449]  Just, this is it, Rand Paul.
[00:44:58.489 --> 00:44:59.670]  This is the big show.
[00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.750]  This is the Super Bowl.
[00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:02.271]  Last Thursday, the Fox debate.
[00:45:02.671 --> 00:45:04.652]  Rand Paul should have launched on all
[00:45:05.496 --> 00:45:06.197]  On all guns.
[00:45:06.898 --> 00:45:07.839]  And that's my opinion.
[00:45:07.899 --> 00:45:09.821]  I just think that he missed one heck of an opportunity.
[00:45:09.861 --> 00:45:12.184]  I just hope he gets another at that level.
[00:45:12.664 --> 00:45:15.988]  But, you know, I don't think Donald Trump's going to miss many more debates.
[00:45:16.469 --> 00:45:18.832]  So he may not have as good an opportunity.
[00:45:19.012 --> 00:45:20.493]  But I do think this.
[00:45:20.894 --> 00:45:25.960]  Based on the attendance that we've seen, Matt and I have been going to a lot of events.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:33.362]  And Rand Paul had a terrific turnout the other night in Iowa City on Saturday night.
[00:45:33.762 --> 00:45:34.322]  We'll have to see.
[00:45:34.342 --> 00:45:35.342]  We'll have to see what happens.
[00:45:35.502 --> 00:45:41.064]  Let me ask you, Richard, can you pop in and out of the caucuses there?
[00:45:41.084 --> 00:45:43.084]  You said there's a Democrat caucus there at that school.
[00:45:43.144 --> 00:45:47.825]  Is it possible for you to leave this one and get into there a little bit and give us a view of what's going on with that?
[00:45:48.665 --> 00:45:50.186]  Supposedly they've locked the doors.
[00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:52.771]  Nah, I'll check it.
[00:45:53.211 --> 00:45:54.272]  I will text you guys.
[00:45:54.332 --> 00:45:56.033]  I will let you know via text.
[00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:56.754]  Okay.
[00:45:56.914 --> 00:46:01.477]  I guess once they get into it and they start yelling and screaming and doing the Chicago hit negotiations.
[00:46:01.617 --> 00:46:07.441]  They don't want anyone else coming in and saying, wait, you were just in this group and now... Yeah, yeah, they've got to get them separated.
[00:46:07.841 --> 00:46:12.885]  Yeah, it's a very different type of approach between the two different parties when they caucus.
[00:46:13.385 --> 00:46:15.807]  I guess reflecting the character of the two different parties.
[00:46:16.187 --> 00:46:24.089]  I want to take a look real quickly at how relevant this has been to who goes on to win out of the two parties for a few elections going back here.
[00:46:24.369 --> 00:46:27.670]  Guys, get that Fred Thompson clip thing ready to run.
[00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:31.971]  When we look at the Democrats, of course, we had Obama win in 2008 with 38%.
[00:46:32.031 --> 00:46:33.951]  Hillary Clinton came in third with 29.5% before that.
[00:46:38.492 --> 00:46:40.833]  John Kerry, who went on to win the nomination, won Iowa.
[00:46:41.393 --> 00:46:42.613]  Before that, Al Gore did it.
[00:46:42.673 --> 00:46:48.455]  So for the Democrats, it seems to be pretty consistent that the ones who win the Iowa caucus have gone on.
[00:46:49.135 --> 00:46:55.176]  The exceptions were 1992, where an Iowa senator, Harkin, got 77% of the vote.
[00:46:55.236 --> 00:46:58.817]  And of course, you know, he was a home senator, so that's to be expected.
[00:46:59.858 --> 00:47:00.798]  Bill Clinton only got 3%.
[00:47:02.278 --> 00:47:03.459]  He came in third and only got 3%.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:11.924]  In 1988, Gephardt got 31%, Paul Simon 27%, and Dukakis, who was in third place at 22%, went on to get the nomination.
[00:47:11.944 --> 00:47:18.308]  But when you look at the rest of these, Mondale, Carter, they overwhelmingly won the Iowa caucus on the Democrat side.
[00:47:18.328 --> 00:47:25.832]  So, Iowa is predominantly Democrat, and the winners, for the most part, have gone on to win the nomination.
[00:47:26.412 --> 00:47:29.354]  In many cases, the presidency out of Iowa.
[00:47:29.594 --> 00:47:37.600]  Now we look at the Republicans, of course we had that train wreck in 2012 where we were told that Romney had won it, then we were told that Santorum had won it.
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:41.283]  I really believe that Ron Paul did, I always believed that he did.
[00:47:41.563 --> 00:47:43.644]  But nevertheless, that was a train wreck then.
[00:47:43.664 --> 00:47:50.169]  We look back in 2008, Huckabee won, McCain came in fourth place, even came in behind
[00:47:50.769 --> 00:47:52.010]  Fred Thompson.
[00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:57.615]  Now, Fred Thompson, many of you may remember, he just died this last fall in his mid-70s.
[00:47:57.675 --> 00:48:00.857]  He had been a lawyer with Nixon.
[00:48:01.458 --> 00:48:03.099]  He had been a lawyer in real life.
[00:48:03.139 --> 00:48:04.800]  He'd become a senator, an actor.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.222]  You've seen him in Law & Order and a lot of other things.
[00:48:07.262 --> 00:48:08.724]  And then he was running in 2008.
[00:48:09.344 --> 00:48:14.148]  And here's a little backroom negotiation.
[00:48:14.168 --> 00:48:18.992]  As they're shooting the commercial, this is how it looked with Fred Thompson.
[00:48:22.671 --> 00:48:23.672]  Fred Thompson, take one.
[00:48:25.313 --> 00:48:27.754]  I'm Fred Thompson, and I support a woman's right to choose.
[00:48:28.075 --> 00:48:28.435]  Cut!
[00:48:28.875 --> 00:48:29.976]  Fred, baby!
[00:48:30.056 --> 00:48:33.318]  You're not lobbyist anymore, and you're not running for the Senate either!
[00:48:33.338 --> 00:48:33.318]  2008!
[00:48:33.358 --> 00:48:35.940]  Fred Thompson, take 24.
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.401]  Hi, I'm Fred Thompson.
[00:48:39.042 --> 00:48:42.784]  While I may not have been in Vietnam, I was in the hunt for Red October.
[00:48:43.145 --> 00:48:43.545]  Cut!
[00:48:44.005 --> 00:48:47.067]  Okay, uh, Fred, uh, why don't we try, uh, national security?
[00:48:47.347 --> 00:48:48.408]  Fred Thompson, take 53.
[00:48:49.169 --> 00:48:52.591]  I'm Fred Thompson, and I sometimes vote against illegal immigration.
[00:48:54.824 --> 00:48:58.046]  Anyway, let's just try your Senate voting records.
[00:48:58.646 --> 00:49:02.028]  I'm Fred Thompson, and I voted 13 times against handguns.
[00:49:02.208 --> 00:49:02.909]  Cut!
[00:49:02.929 --> 00:49:06.411]  I made over $1 million in lobbying fees.
[00:49:06.631 --> 00:49:06.931]  Cut!
[00:49:06.951 --> 00:49:09.832]  Mr. B. Hillary Clinton, $100 million.
[00:49:09.852 --> 00:49:10.373]  Cut!
[00:49:11.113 --> 00:49:14.595]  Maybe in 2008 we should just keep it simple.
[00:49:15.756 --> 00:49:18.857]  I'm Fred Thompson, and that's something worth thinking about.
[00:49:20.238 --> 00:49:22.326]  And that's a cartoon worth seeing.
[00:49:25.452 --> 00:49:27.673]  Pretty accurate for most politicians.
[00:49:27.773 --> 00:49:31.715]  Yeah, you could pretty much transfer that to many of the people who are running in either party.
[00:49:32.835 --> 00:49:37.257]  Just finally get back to I'm Fred Thompson and that's something to think about.
[00:49:37.317 --> 00:49:38.417]  And that's what a lot of this is.
[00:49:38.437 --> 00:49:44.400]  A lot of this is the appeal of personality as opposed to their position on issues.
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:50.122]  Because just like you saw with Fred Thompson, you can't really tell which party this guy is in because he doesn't know himself.
[00:49:50.542 --> 00:49:51.524]  Pretty much, yeah.
[00:49:51.544 --> 00:50:01.737]  When we look at the rest of the Republicans, some of the surprises that came in were, like in 1996, Bob Dole, who went on to win the nomination, narrowly beat Pat Buchanan.
[00:50:03.039 --> 00:50:07.942]  You had Bob Dole winning in 88, and George H.W.
[00:50:07.982 --> 00:50:10.744]  Bush came in third place, quite a bit behind him.
[00:50:10.884 --> 00:50:16.307]  Dole got 37, Bush got 19, and Pat Robertson beat George H.W.
[00:50:16.327 --> 00:50:16.527]  Bush.
[00:50:16.927 --> 00:50:20.289]  That's the strength of the Christian voting bloc in Iowa.
[00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:22.150]  And then going back to 1980, Bush beat Reagan by 2%, 32% to 30%.
[00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:24.731]  So that was kind of a wake-up call for Reagan.
[00:50:29.754 --> 00:50:32.996]  But he did recover and went on to win the presidency.
[00:50:33.036 --> 00:50:37.157]  So do we have some updates on the votes that are coming through?
[00:50:38.258 --> 00:50:39.778]  So we have the Huffington Post here.
[00:50:39.818 --> 00:50:49.403]  We can see the numbers keep changing rapidly, but right now we see Ted Cruz is in the lead over Donald Trump, and Hillary has a lead over Bernie Sanders.
[00:50:49.883 --> 00:50:57.046]  Martin O'Malley is not doing too well, but you know, of course, this is very early in the polling numbers, so we'll see how the thing develops as time goes on.
[00:50:57.486 --> 00:51:03.758]  And the reason we're seeing those different numbers there is because what's reported on the Republican side is the actual number of votes.
[00:51:03.778 --> 00:51:09.067]  So right now, even because it's early, we're seeing like 1,200 votes for Trump and Cruz each.
[00:51:10.723 --> 00:51:12.924]  On the Democrat side, we're seeing 97 and 86.
[00:51:13.304 --> 00:51:14.904]  Those are actually the delegates.
[00:51:14.924 --> 00:51:22.947]  So what they do is, caucus by caucus, they decide how many delegates are going to apportion to each one of the candidates, and that's what they phone up.
[00:51:23.367 --> 00:51:28.368]  Well, we have some concerns with how they're actually saying that the delegates that are there.
[00:51:28.848 --> 00:51:36.871]  The Sanders campaign was saying that there was a possibility that the Clinton campaign was planning to pack the caucuses with people who weren't even from
[00:51:38.279 --> 00:51:38.983]  That area.
[00:51:39.003 --> 00:51:40.711]  Like people from Mexico?
[00:51:42.182 --> 00:51:43.563]  That's what's coming in the general election.
[00:51:43.703 --> 00:51:45.464]  Because all they need is a warm body there.
[00:51:46.024 --> 00:52:03.695]  But this is a resident who said he received an alarming letter that urged him to caucus for Clinton and identified a non-resident as his local precinct captain, who now they're concerned that they're just kind of bringing in warm bodies to pack the caucus.
[00:52:03.975 --> 00:52:10.379]  You know, my grandmother was a Republican until the day she died, and then she started voting Democrat.
[00:52:12.475 --> 00:52:13.176]  That's funny, Darren.
[00:52:13.796 --> 00:52:17.178]  According to the... I'm looking at Microsoft's crystal ball.
[00:52:17.259 --> 00:52:18.139]  It is still correct.
[00:52:18.339 --> 00:52:20.081]  They have Hillary up ahead of Sanders.
[00:52:20.581 --> 00:52:22.282]  But it's closer than I thought it was going to be.
[00:52:22.903 --> 00:52:23.063]  Yeah.
[00:52:23.223 --> 00:52:23.483]  Yeah.
[00:52:23.643 --> 00:52:24.043]  Interesting.
[00:52:24.164 --> 00:52:28.567]  Well, I guess behind us we're getting some feed of... They're counting the votes here.
[00:52:28.987 --> 00:52:29.387]  Okay, yeah.
[00:52:29.407 --> 00:52:30.848]  We've got a live feed from...
[00:52:31.869 --> 00:52:35.633]  Richard Reeves who is at one of the Iowa caucus locations on the Republican side.
[00:52:35.813 --> 00:52:39.837]  They are slipping ballots into boxes right now.
[00:52:39.897 --> 00:52:48.986]  That's the way they do it there as opposed to having a kind of a Chicago commodities exchange for the candidates.
[00:52:49.307 --> 00:52:52.310]  I'll trade you one Hillary for two Sanders or something.
[00:52:54.465 --> 00:52:55.866]  What's the going rate for Hillary?
[00:52:55.926 --> 00:52:57.568]  That's what they ought to be saying.
[00:52:57.768 --> 00:52:59.289]  But this is a really interesting thing, though.
[00:52:59.329 --> 00:53:11.098]  If you think if they're just getting people there from out of state to come in and participate in the caucus, it's the same argument that people have about not requiring an ID to vote.
[00:53:11.519 --> 00:53:15.962]  Because you can vote multiple times, you don't have to... You can vote for other people.
[00:53:16.303 --> 00:53:16.503]  Yeah.
[00:53:17.245 --> 00:53:18.086]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:53:18.106 --> 00:53:19.448]  You could be dead.
[00:53:19.548 --> 00:53:20.790]  It does bring up that question.
[00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:23.173]  There was one thing that came out today that I thought was kind of interesting.
[00:53:23.213 --> 00:53:25.797]  And you know, one person we haven't talked about is poor Jeb.
[00:53:26.457 --> 00:53:27.819]  You know, he earned that.
[00:53:27.859 --> 00:53:29.141]  He earned that exclamation mark.
[00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:31.244]  Why didn't he just make it to the abyss yet?
[00:53:32.145 --> 00:53:41.690]  This is something that came out of Free Republic and basically it was a picture of a flyer saying, earn fast cash today.
[00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:46.112]  Seat fillers needed today, February 1st at 12pm for campaign event.
[00:53:46.352 --> 00:53:47.513]  $25 per hour, 2 hours max.
[00:53:47.553 --> 00:53:48.113]  Bring your friends.
[00:53:48.173 --> 00:53:49.093]  First come, first serve.
[00:53:49.194 --> 00:53:49.874]  Please be prompt.
[00:53:50.414 --> 00:53:53.237]  And for more information, contact the Jeb Bush people.
[00:53:53.277 --> 00:53:58.963]  Now, that may have been quite, very likely was a hoax.
[00:53:58.983 --> 00:53:59.824]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:59.884 --> 00:54:04.549]  But I tell you, it really did catch the zeitgeist of the Jeb Bush campaign.
[00:54:05.189 --> 00:54:08.953]  They say they think it might have been done by somebody in the Rubio campaign.
[00:54:08.973 --> 00:54:10.415]  They had traced it back to that.
[00:54:10.775 --> 00:54:14.901]  And that kind of fits with Rubio too, because the two of them have really been going after each other.
[00:54:15.782 --> 00:54:25.195]  Jeb, very angry that he's blown through basically his trust fund that was put out there by all these bigwig GOP donors.
[00:54:25.256 --> 00:54:26.758]  Who are we going to throw it to?
[00:54:27.779 --> 00:54:31.183]  We're going to go to a break at 8.
[00:54:31.343 --> 00:54:33.726]  We're going to take a break at 8.
[00:54:34.426 --> 00:54:36.489]  And there was also a picture that came up.
[00:54:36.509 --> 00:54:39.552]  See if you guys can pull this up on the monitor for anybody watching the feed here.
[00:54:40.333 --> 00:54:47.080]  We've got the one and only wedding picture of Jeb Bush on the big day.
[00:54:48.501 --> 00:54:50.902]  It's pretty amusing to look at this picture.
[00:54:50.962 --> 00:54:54.263]  If you guys can pull this up or at least get a shot of the desk there.
[00:54:54.343 --> 00:54:54.804]  There you go.
[00:54:54.884 --> 00:54:57.405]  That's Jeb Bush on his wedding day.
[00:54:57.425 --> 00:55:01.346]  He put that on Facebook today.
[00:55:01.366 --> 00:55:03.747]  That was his 41st anniversary.
[00:55:04.407 --> 00:55:07.108]  And he says that's the only picture he's got of his wedding.
[00:55:07.489 --> 00:55:13.331]  And the story that he gives, the reason for it, he says, is because Brother Marvin was the photographer.
[00:55:13.971 --> 00:55:21.377]  And Brother Marvin accidentally re-rolled from a Frank Zappa concert and took the pictures, you know, double exposed it, I guess.
[00:55:21.537 --> 00:55:21.957]  I don't know.
[00:55:22.097 --> 00:55:27.982]  Or maybe, maybe Jeb in a fit of anger destroyed all the other copies after he saw this one.
[00:55:28.042 --> 00:55:28.483]  I don't know.
[00:55:28.543 --> 00:55:29.964]  He's like, I want the evidence out.
[00:55:30.504 --> 00:55:34.306]  That's a great, beautiful thing with film, though, is he could have had like a Zappa filter.
[00:55:34.326 --> 00:55:36.108]  They should put that new filter for Instagram.
[00:55:36.168 --> 00:55:36.988]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:37.008 --> 00:55:39.570]  It might have looked cooler if Zappa was standing there in the picture.
[00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:45.473]  But I thought it was kind of interesting that it was Marvin because, you know, brother Marvin, you don't hear too much about Marvin and Neil.
[00:55:45.493 --> 00:55:47.975]  You know, Neil was involved in the savings and loans scandal.
[00:55:48.575 --> 00:55:50.997]  Marvin is the one that you really don't hear much about.
[00:55:51.057 --> 00:55:52.578]  He was the guy who was head of security
[00:55:53.178 --> 00:56:01.663]  At the Trade Centers up until 9-10 and then somehow he just miraculously was replaced the day before all this stuff happened.
[00:56:01.683 --> 00:56:03.244]  They take Brother Marvin out.
[00:56:03.304 --> 00:56:03.865]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:03.885 --> 00:56:05.065]  This is breaking news for me.
[00:56:05.085 --> 00:56:06.386]  Really?
[00:56:06.506 --> 00:56:07.026]  That's right.
[00:56:07.427 --> 00:56:08.387]  Yeah, Brother Marvin.
[00:56:09.788 --> 00:56:10.509]  No connection.
[00:56:11.649 --> 00:56:13.231]  That's a huge conspiracy there.
[00:56:13.271 --> 00:56:19.316]  We had Jeb Bush always saying that, you know, they called him Vito Corleone because he vetoed so many bills in Florida and everything.
[00:56:19.376 --> 00:56:21.498]  I said, no, Jeb, they're calling you Fredo.
[00:56:21.818 --> 00:56:24.120]  You know, mine was a godfather story.
[00:56:24.501 --> 00:56:28.144]  But it might be that, you know, Marvin is truly the Fredo.
[00:56:28.444 --> 00:56:28.884]  I don't know.
[00:56:30.698 --> 00:56:31.978]  Even messed up.
[00:56:32.058 --> 00:56:33.299]  They just keep on coming.
[00:56:33.519 --> 00:56:34.559]  Yeah, they just keep going.
[00:56:34.919 --> 00:56:40.521]  But of course, as he's falling by the wayside, Goldman Sachs is putting their money on a different horse.
[00:56:40.681 --> 00:56:45.022]  And that looks like Marco Rubio is the one who's picking up most of the money from Goldman Sachs.
[00:56:45.642 --> 00:56:54.125]  As Jeb Bush is fading into the rest of the pack, they said there's been a 50% jump in money given by Goldman Sachs to
[00:56:55.615 --> 00:57:04.063]  Marco Rubio, and of course they gave him over $107,000, Goldman Sachs employees, in the first quarter of the year.
[00:57:04.983 --> 00:57:10.869]  They say that they had given $773,000 to Bush's campaign committee.
[00:57:10.949 --> 00:57:13.691]  So, you know, he's pulled in huge amounts of cash.
[00:57:13.711 --> 00:57:17.074]  Well, that alone is pretty suspect if you get that much money from Goldman Sachs.
[00:57:17.114 --> 00:57:18.375]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:57:18.395 --> 00:57:19.757]  Well, I mean, did he report it, though?
[00:57:21.189 --> 00:57:23.551]  Well, that is what's reported, yeah.
[00:57:23.791 --> 00:57:26.593]  So we don't really know what the grand total is, but that's what's been reported.
[00:57:27.094 --> 00:57:39.924]  And the interesting thing is, as the New York Times points out today, they're starting to align between the big donors, the Republican Party, are starting to align either behind Rubio or Ted Cruz.
[00:57:40.544 --> 00:57:45.326]  Rubio had been rumored to have won the Sheldon Adelson primary.
[00:57:45.366 --> 00:57:46.606]  That's a primary.
[00:57:46.646 --> 00:57:50.188]  Sheldon Adelson is the large casino operator out in Nevada.
[00:57:50.588 --> 00:57:58.931]  He was the one, if you remember four years ago, when they had the Nevada caucus, he was, that was on a Friday, let's see, it was on a Saturday night.
[00:57:59.491 --> 00:58:01.052]  Was it, I think, Friday night or Saturday night?
[00:58:01.092 --> 00:58:04.473]  Anyway, it was on a night when Jewish people couldn't go.
[00:58:04.573 --> 00:58:12.896]  Sheldon Adelson's major issue is to stamp out online gaming, but then behind that he wants to support Israel.
[00:58:12.936 --> 00:58:15.036]  I mean, he is a full-on Zionist.
[00:58:15.076 --> 00:58:23.739]  And so he pulled his strings with the Nevada Republican Party and said, we're going to organize a conference for Jews only on Sunday or whatever.
[00:58:23.799 --> 00:58:25.260]  So there were a lot of people who are not Jewish
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:31.863]  Who also couldn't attend on the night that it had originally been scheduled, and they came in to vote there and said, nope, you have to be Jewish to do this.
[00:58:31.903 --> 00:58:42.227]  I mean, it was pretty amazing that they tried to enforce that and tell Ron Paul supporters who had had to work that other night that they couldn't come in and vote on that second night.
[00:58:42.707 --> 00:58:46.909]  And he gave $10 million in the last cycle to Newt Gingrich.
[00:58:46.949 --> 00:58:49.470]  He was the one that they put their money on in the last cycle.
[00:58:50.074 --> 00:58:55.342]  But it's been reported that they now want to, uh, back either Marco Rubio.
[00:58:55.362 --> 00:59:04.375]  But then as he started to sag and his crew started to move up, they said, Well, maybe Sheldon will support Rubio and maybe his wife will support Cruz.
[00:59:04.395 --> 00:59:05.236]  So we'll see what happens.
[00:59:05.256 --> 00:59:06.238]  We're gonna take a quick break.
[00:59:06.738 --> 00:59:09.341]  And when we come back, we're going to continue with some of the updates.
[00:59:09.381 --> 00:59:14.786]  They're starting to come in pretty quickly now, the returns from the caucus locations.
[00:59:14.806 --> 00:59:15.847]  So we're going to come back with that.
[00:59:16.147 --> 00:59:20.472]  We're also going to come back with some more clips from interviews that we've had with Donald Trump.
[00:59:20.552 --> 00:59:23.315]  Alex Jones has interviewed him as well as Rand Paul.
[00:59:23.755 --> 00:59:27.519]  And with him, I think it's been last month or so, we've had a couple of interviews with him.
[00:59:27.539 --> 00:59:29.661]  So we're going to have some excerpts from that when we come back.
[00:59:29.701 --> 00:59:30.061]  Stay with us.
[00:59:30.081 --> 00:59:30.622]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:44.068 --> 00:59:45.430]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:46.992]  You can't survive without it.
[00:59:47.193 --> 00:59:48.094]  But where do you get it?
[00:59:48.394 --> 00:59:54.163]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:59:54.383 --> 01:00:00.091]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:17.161]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:19.683]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:00:20.023 --> 01:00:21.224]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:00:21.504 --> 01:00:22.285]  Easy assembly.

[01:00:52.269 --> 01:00:53.031]  Vote for Jeb?
[01:00:53.792 --> 01:00:55.314]  Well, you're just f***ing stupid.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.622]  Fool me, can't get fooled again.

[01:02:45.905 --> 01:02:51.067]  Richard Reeves with Infowars.com in Iowa City at a big Rand Paul event that we're about to see.
[01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:52.208]  Who are we speaking with?
[01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:53.008]  Joe.
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.323]  Joe, so we see, we noticed, we really like your shirt.
[01:02:57.383 --> 01:02:59.244]  That's one of the reasons you stood out for us, Joe.
[01:02:59.764 --> 01:03:00.865]  Hillary for Prison 2016.
[01:03:01.586 --> 01:03:03.327]  Do you get a lot of people that respond to that?
[01:03:03.787 --> 01:03:05.429]  I've gotten several high fives tonight.
[01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:11.353]  Well, but outside of this event where, obviously, Hillary for Prison is outside of here?
[01:03:11.533 --> 01:03:12.354]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:15.276]  Alright, so what are you thinking about tomorrow's caucuses?
[01:03:15.296 --> 01:03:16.177]  What do you think is going to happen?
[01:03:16.217 --> 01:03:17.198]  How do you think it's going to shake out?
[01:03:18.769 --> 01:03:22.934]  Well, I think it's pretty safe to say there's going to be a lot of scheming going on.
[01:03:23.555 --> 01:03:26.899]  A lot of people getting the shaft, who probably shouldn't.
[01:03:27.279 --> 01:03:28.020]  Perhaps Rand.
[01:03:29.962 --> 01:03:35.509]  Well, one thing Rand Paul said today on the early Sunday morning show, and I believe him, is that there's 1,681 precincts in Iowa
[01:03:37.931 --> 01:03:44.439]  And there are 1,000 Rand Paul Loyalist precinct captains that are going to be running 1,000 caucuses.
[01:03:44.479 --> 01:03:50.165]  So, that's one thing I was commenting about earlier on the live show is that you've got at least 1,000 honest brokers.
[01:03:50.185 --> 01:03:51.507]  These guys are going to be honest brokers.
[01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:53.990]  They're going to actually report whatever really happens.
[01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:56.613]  So, and then I think in these other 681, you're going to have
[01:03:59.375 --> 01:04:01.396]  You're going to have too many eyeballs watching what's going on.
[01:04:01.436 --> 01:04:02.916]  Have you been in caucus before?
[01:04:02.936 --> 01:04:03.956]  I did, for Ron.
[01:04:05.536 --> 01:04:03.956]  2012.
[01:04:05.897 --> 01:04:09.437]  So, aren't there tons of witnesses that are watching the ballots being counted?
[01:04:09.657 --> 01:04:10.878]  Now, Microsoft's a different issue.
[01:04:10.898 --> 01:04:12.698]  Do you want to weigh in on the Microsoft thing?
[01:04:13.378 --> 01:04:17.459]  Well, Microsoft, you can't trust them for anything.
[01:04:18.159 --> 01:04:21.440]  But what I think is, is that the precinct officials
[01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:28.337]  Are gonna be watching Microsoft and if they don't report the proper numbers for that precinct, they're gonna cry foul, are they not?
[01:04:29.018 --> 01:04:33.684]  Well, I'd like to think so, but, you know, I was at the straw poll in Ames in 2012.
[01:04:34.144 --> 01:04:37.689]  Ron, you know, had the most supporters there by far.
[01:04:39.131 --> 01:04:44.715]  Visually, you could see that just looking, but somehow Michelle won.
[01:04:44.936 --> 01:04:47.738]  I always found that really fishy.
[01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:53.122]  She had the tiniest little amount of supporters there.
[01:04:53.622 --> 01:04:57.725]  Each candidate had a different color shirt that their supporters got.
[01:04:59.186 --> 01:05:00.227]  She had the least amount.
[01:05:00.487 --> 01:05:04.369]  So somehow they had the control of that straw poll.
[01:05:04.409 --> 01:05:06.731]  Somehow they controlled the operation.
[01:05:07.131 --> 01:05:10.653]  Okay, so did they actually count ballots though in front in the public?
[01:05:10.713 --> 01:05:11.173]  How did they do it?
[01:05:11.193 --> 01:05:12.634]  I didn't see anyone do that.
[01:05:12.874 --> 01:05:14.075]  I don't know if they did that perhaps.
[01:05:14.295 --> 01:05:15.776]  So that's what helped them steal it then?
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:17.801]  I would certainly think so.
[01:05:18.301 --> 01:05:31.668]  Well, from my understanding here in Iowa caucus is they're going to bring those three by five cards where people have secretly written down the name of who their candidate is and they're going to bring them up to the table up front and there's going to be at least five caucus officials
[01:05:32.248 --> 01:05:36.374]  Which in many cases is going to be at least one Rand Pauler running the precinct in a lot of cases.
[01:05:36.854 --> 01:05:46.327]  And they're going to sit there and so you gotta get five people to conspire to lie in front of potentially the biggest caucus groups that we've ever had.
[01:05:46.647 --> 01:05:47.608]  Stranger things have happened.
[01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:49.749]  Yeah, well, no, I agree with you.
[01:05:49.769 --> 01:05:51.070]  Because, like, you're talking about the straw poll.
[01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:54.950]  That's like there was a straw poll in Fort Worth back in, I think, 2007.
[01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:59.511]  And there was visually more Ron Paul support there at that straw poll.
[01:05:59.911 --> 01:06:04.372]  But the guys that were running that event was the establishment GOP guys.
[01:06:04.652 --> 01:06:05.572]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:06:05.932 --> 01:06:09.413]  But people in power don't want that to happen, so it doesn't.
[01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:09.873]  Yeah.
[01:06:10.453 --> 01:06:10.793]  Okay.
[01:06:10.873 --> 01:06:13.493]  Well, Joe, you got anything else to let our audience know?
[01:06:13.854 --> 01:06:14.014]  Nope.
[01:06:14.174 --> 01:06:14.654]  Love you guys.
[01:06:14.674 --> 01:06:14.994]  Thank you.
[01:06:15.014 --> 01:06:15.634]  All right.
[01:06:15.654 --> 01:06:16.154]  Thank you, Joe.
[01:06:16.694 --> 01:06:22.757]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can get six months free at PrisonPlanet.TV, but only for one more week.
[01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:26.198]  Next Monday, the special that only comes around once a year ends.
[01:06:26.258 --> 01:06:37.243]  In fact, we've never offered six months free before, but I really want to get more people to join and be able to watch the nightly news, to see the live reports we do, the special reports, all my films, e-books, and so much more.
[01:06:37.823 --> 01:06:40.605]  One person can share their membership with 20 people.
[01:06:41.545 --> 01:06:49.727]  And you are funding the absolute, very leading edge, the vanguard of the resistance to the globalist operation on every front.
[01:06:49.827 --> 01:06:54.508]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system to shut down.
[01:06:54.648 --> 01:06:56.328]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:56.388 --> 01:07:01.909]  We put out the daily radio show free with a video and audio feeds at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:07:02.049 --> 01:07:10.071]  But it is the members that get the nightly news exclusively and first and the commercial free video podcasts and audio podcasts that are
[01:07:10.191 --> 01:07:25.869]  Paying it forward and financing and helping so many other people see the truth when we put the videos on Facebook, YouTube, and it's PrisonPlanet.TV that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew.
[01:07:26.249 --> 01:07:26.950]  The Reporters.
[01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:30.312]  You are becoming a PrisonPlanet.TV member.
[01:07:30.573 --> 01:07:38.700]  You get exclusive HD, higher quality, get it first, and then you can download it, share it with friends and family, share your passcode with them, your username.
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:43.103]  It's a win-win, and then you're helping finance to put it out for free to everybody.
[01:07:43.303 --> 01:07:45.305]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:51.771]  It's never gonna get any better.
[01:07:52.191 --> 01:07:52.892]  Don't look for it.
[01:07:53.332 --> 01:07:54.433]  Be happy with what you got.
[01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:58.635]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[01:07:59.195 --> 01:08:00.837]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[01:08:01.237 --> 01:08:06.882]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[01:08:07.262 --> 01:08:08.503]  Forget the politicians.
[01:08:08.723 --> 01:08:12.006]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[01:08:13.568 --> 01:08:14.008]  You don't.
[01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:15.789]  You have no choice.
[01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:17.091]  You have owners.
[01:08:17.391 --> 01:08:18.332]  They own you.
[01:08:19.645 --> 01:08:20.946]  They own everything.
[01:08:21.186 --> 01:08:22.826]  They own all the important land.
[01:08:23.186 --> 01:08:24.927]  They own and control the corporations.
[01:08:24.947 --> 01:08:28.428]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[01:08:28.449 --> 01:08:30.029]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:35.171]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[01:08:35.351 --> 01:08:36.972]  They got you by the balls!
[01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:40.592]  They want obedient workers.
[01:08:41.032 --> 01:08:42.534]  Obedient workers.
[01:08:42.834 --> 01:08:55.546]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[01:08:55.626 --> 01:09:01.992]  And now, they're coming for your social security money, so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[01:09:03.413 --> 01:09:04.314]  It's a big club.
[01:09:05.296 --> 01:09:06.116]  And you ain't in it.
[01:09:06.697 --> 01:09:09.398]  You and I are not in the big club.
[01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:11.719]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:16.081]  It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[01:09:17.502 --> 01:09:19.002]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[01:09:19.362 --> 01:09:22.844]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[01:09:22.884 --> 01:09:26.806]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[01:09:26.846 --> 01:09:27.766]  They're not interested in that.
[01:09:28.046 --> 01:09:28.967]  That doesn't help them.
[01:09:29.367 --> 01:09:30.767]  That's against their interest.
[01:09:31.228 --> 01:09:31.628]  That's right.
[01:10:30.728 --> 01:10:35.552]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News live coverage of the Iowa caucus.
[01:10:35.712 --> 01:10:44.778]  I'm David Knight and we have with us Leanne McAdoo and Jakari Jackson and also we have Richard Reeves who is live in Iowa at one of the Republican caucus sites.
[01:10:45.599 --> 01:10:49.282]  They had people getting up and speaking on behalf of various candidates.
[01:10:49.322 --> 01:10:55.546]  They had no one there to speak for Carly Fiorina and John Kasich.
[01:10:55.746 --> 01:10:59.029]  Those two did not have anybody to speak for them and I believe also Rick Santorum.
[01:10:59.329 --> 01:11:04.811]  But all the other candidates that were running in the GOP primary had someone get up and speak on their behalf.
[01:11:04.831 --> 01:11:09.152]  He said there was a lot of applause for the person who spoke on behalf of Rand Paul.
[01:11:09.172 --> 01:11:11.232]  We're looking at the results coming in right now.
[01:11:11.912 --> 01:11:13.573]  And Rand Paul is in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th place.
[01:11:13.593 --> 01:11:14.093]  It's Ted Cruz.
[01:11:17.634 --> 01:11:19.396]  Then Donald Trump, they're very close.
[01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:28.883]  Marco Rubio, then Ben Carson, Rand Paul, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee has moved up over the rest of the pack, so we'll be watching this as it develops.
[01:11:28.903 --> 01:11:30.124]  It's still pretty early.
[01:11:30.164 --> 01:11:32.246]  They started turning in votes at 7.30.
[01:11:33.127 --> 01:11:38.812]  It's now 8.11, and of course we're on the same time zone as Iowa's Central Time Zone.
[01:11:39.152 --> 01:11:44.736]  And the Democrat side, we've got still, it's very close between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.
[01:11:44.777 --> 01:11:46.058]  Very, very close at this point.
[01:11:46.978 --> 01:11:50.359]  Let's go back to Richard Reeves in Iowa for an update.
[01:11:50.399 --> 01:11:50.659]  Richard.
[01:11:50.959 --> 01:11:51.940]  Interesting.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:55.521]  Richard, are you there?
[01:11:56.501 --> 01:11:57.581]  I think maybe you lost Richard.
[01:11:57.641 --> 01:11:59.142]  A little technical difficulty.
[01:11:59.162 --> 01:12:03.403]  Well, one of the interesting things that's coming up, of course, is there's been a lot of talk about Hillary Clinton's health.
[01:12:04.642 --> 01:12:08.926]  And Bernie Sanders is no spring chicken either.
[01:12:09.346 --> 01:12:16.231]  You know, we look at oldest presidents, the oldest one was Ronald Reagan, who was 69 when he took office.
[01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:21.335]  Now, if Hillary is elected, she would be the same age as Ronald Reagan when taking office.
[01:12:21.376 --> 01:12:22.697]  The same thing is true of Trump.
[01:12:24.278 --> 01:12:32.461]  And in 1986, when Ronald Reagan turned 75, many of you might remember, Saturday Night Live did a joke about it.
[01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:41.506]  It had Dennis Miller talking about President Reagan, who had been elected at 69, and says, well, belated happy birthday to the president who turned 70, 70, 75!
[01:12:42.546 --> 01:12:43.527]  Is that right?
[01:12:43.547 --> 01:12:43.527]  75?
[01:12:43.867 --> 01:12:46.508]  He goes, and he's got access to the nuclear football.
[01:12:46.548 --> 01:12:49.229]  He goes, we've got, I've got my grandfather who's 75.
[01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:52.491]  We don't even let him use the remote control for the TV set.
[01:12:52.651 --> 01:12:57.375]  So they're making fun of Ronald Reagan for being 75 and yet Bernie Sanders would begin at 75.
[01:12:57.495 --> 01:12:59.336]  Not at 69 like Ronald Reagan.
[01:12:59.456 --> 01:13:03.600]  And you have not heard anyone really talking about that at all.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.881]  But it was this huge issue with Hillary and her health.
[01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:10.605]  Well I think it kind of balances out in people's minds because he's so old but his supporters are so young.
[01:13:11.065 --> 01:13:16.208]  And I've been talking to some of the guys in the crew, and I was like, if I was 17, 18 years old, I'd probably like Bernie Sanders, too.
[01:13:16.588 --> 01:13:24.433]  Because as a child, you hear, I'm going to get all this free stuff, and then you become an adult, and you look at your taxes, you look at your paychecks, and you're like, free stuff isn't free.
[01:13:24.673 --> 01:13:30.036]  But the thing that's kind of shocking to me is the amount of adults that are actually feeling the burn.
[01:13:30.056 --> 01:13:31.437]  And it's like, you should know better.
[01:13:33.078 --> 01:13:41.201]  Well, the interesting thing about Bernie is, as old as he is, and again, you know, remember there was that Dennis Miller joke about Reagan when he turned 75.
[01:13:41.561 --> 01:13:43.202]  He would start at that age.
[01:13:43.622 --> 01:13:46.884]  As old as he is, his ideas are even older.
[01:13:47.444 --> 01:13:48.904]  And even more discredited.
[01:13:48.944 --> 01:13:52.626]  I mean, the guy is a walking relic out of the 1960s.
[01:13:52.706 --> 01:13:56.047]  They're playing a Simon and Garfunkel background.
[01:13:56.067 --> 01:14:00.109]  I mean, he's going to have Ben and Jerry's out there.
[01:14:00.449 --> 01:14:02.130]  The Grateful Dead, I guess.
[01:14:03.371 --> 01:14:05.395]  Well, I like what he says.
[01:14:06.176 --> 01:14:09.863]  If he wins, he's not going to wear a tux to his inaugural ball.
[01:14:09.903 --> 01:14:12.508]  Well, I don't think anybody wants to see him there anyway.
[01:14:12.528 --> 01:14:13.970]  He says it's a sign of privilege.
[01:14:14.747 --> 01:14:20.893]  Yeah, well he's applying for one of the most... Yeah, he's not going to wear the tux, so... Here's a clue, Bernie.
[01:14:21.013 --> 01:14:24.216]  You know, being in the White House is one of the most privileged things you can have there.
[01:14:24.236 --> 01:14:27.118]  I guess it's the ultimate white privilege, the White House privilege.
[01:14:27.439 --> 01:14:34.325]  And that's certainly the way Obama has been using it, his White House privilege, with all of his executive orders.
[01:14:34.365 --> 01:14:36.467]  So what do you guys, what's your read on this?
[01:14:37.949 --> 01:14:42.237]  Of the various candidates that would go in there, how do you think they're going to be with executive orders?
[01:14:42.257 --> 01:14:45.823]  Of course, I think Hillary Clinton would just go absolutely nuts with them.
[01:14:45.883 --> 01:14:47.246]  But what do you think about Bernie?
[01:14:48.664 --> 01:14:52.327]  Um, well, here's the thing is I don't think Bernie's going to be able to get anything done.
[01:14:52.627 --> 01:14:55.930]  So the only way he'll be able to do anything is with executive orders.
[01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:57.531]  It'll be gridlock there.
[01:14:57.811 --> 01:15:02.475]  I think out of all the candidates, if it was, if he was to get there, I'd probably say Chris Christie.
[01:15:02.715 --> 01:15:04.256]  I would expect the most executive order.
[01:15:04.336 --> 01:15:04.677]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:04.797 --> 01:15:05.257]  Yeah.
[01:15:05.377 --> 01:15:06.498]  He would be very dangerous.
[01:15:06.598 --> 01:15:07.479]  He would be very dangerous.
[01:15:07.999 --> 01:15:09.901]  Well, we're going to wait and see what happens.
[01:15:09.961 --> 01:15:13.363]  But right now, let's go to Richard Reeves, who's in Iowa with us now.
[01:15:13.403 --> 01:15:16.366]  He's at one of the caucus locations for the Republicans.
[01:15:16.426 --> 01:15:16.646]  Richard.
[01:15:18.104 --> 01:15:19.385]  Okay, David, thank you very much.
[01:15:19.465 --> 01:15:25.388]  Richard Reeves in West Des Moines, Iowa here at Fair Meadows Elementary Gym.
[01:15:25.408 --> 01:15:37.195]  And, you know, one of the things that we needed to talk about when they first started this caucus, we got cut a little bit short, but all day long here on Fox, on CNN, and especially local media.
[01:15:37.876 --> 01:15:38.857]  Rubio Surge.
[01:15:39.157 --> 01:15:40.118]  Rubio Surge.
[01:15:40.298 --> 01:15:41.258]  Rubio Surge.
[01:15:41.599 --> 01:15:42.379]  Rubio Surge.
[01:15:42.459 --> 01:15:43.540]  Mind control level.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:44.721]  Rubio Surge.
[01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:45.381]  Right.
[01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:49.244]  But at this caucus, unfortunately, it apparently has worked.
[01:15:49.264 --> 01:15:53.447]  Have you guys had the photo of the table with the three stacks of ballots?
[01:15:53.467 --> 01:15:54.728]  Do y'all have that photo ready?
[01:15:56.369 --> 01:15:57.630]  I don't think we've got that photo.
[01:15:57.730 --> 01:15:58.270]  Oh, here it is.
[01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.810]  Oh, there it is.
[01:15:58.830 --> 01:15:59.371]  Yeah, we got that.
[01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:00.492]  OK, we got that photo.
[01:16:00.532 --> 01:16:00.772]  Yeah.
[01:16:01.392 --> 01:16:02.873]  You guys, you guys should have that.
[01:16:02.953 --> 01:16:03.694]  Are they showing the photo?
[01:16:03.734 --> 01:16:03.994]  Yes.
[01:16:04.014 --> 01:16:05.255]  That photo.
[01:16:06.244 --> 01:16:10.045]  On the first stack, that is the Marco Rubio stack.
[01:16:10.626 --> 01:16:12.066]  I don't know who the second stack is.
[01:16:12.366 --> 01:16:14.067]  The nearest stack is Marco Rubio.
[01:16:14.467 --> 01:16:16.528]  There's a middle stack that's shorter.
[01:16:16.968 --> 01:16:19.869]  And the first away stack, that is the Donald Trump stack.
[01:16:19.949 --> 01:16:21.590]  So you can visually see
[01:16:22.466 --> 01:16:38.295]  That it appears, I don't know the exact count yet, we'll know the count here in a little bit, but unfortunately it looks like at this particular caucus that the New World Order has pulled it off in this little caucus area in this neighborhood with their propaganda, mainstream media, and their advertising.
[01:16:38.775 --> 01:16:49.943]  That's interesting because Jeb Bush has spent a lot of money directly attacking Marco Rubio because Marco Rubio and Jeb are trying to get the same establishment donors there.
[01:16:50.043 --> 01:16:52.985]  So he's spent a lot of money to try to take him down.
[01:16:53.005 --> 01:17:00.490]  I guess it really speaks to how ineffective all of this television advertising has been this term because it's had absolutely no effect.
[01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:02.451]  He's spent a lot of money with no effect.
[01:17:03.672 --> 01:17:13.519]  Right, but with the news broadcasting that Marco Rubio is surging, like I said earlier, over and over and over all day long.
[01:17:13.859 --> 01:17:19.523]  Every time I turn on Fox, within one or two minutes, the Marco Rubio surge is happening.
[01:17:20.123 --> 01:17:26.307]  Every time we turn on CNN, if you got past their commercials, it'd come back from a commercial break, Marco Rubio is surging.
[01:17:27.468 --> 01:17:29.850]  Yeah, Fox is one of the worst about that.
[01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:35.173]  I mean, remember when they were telling everybody, oh, Carly Fiorina, Carly Fiorina, and you could see her go up in the polls.
[01:17:35.233 --> 01:17:37.955]  And then, you know, they would let that go down, then they'd pull somebody else up.
[01:17:38.275 --> 01:17:40.337]  And they did that the last election cycle, too.
[01:17:40.357 --> 01:17:46.480]  Remember how we would have one candidate come up out of nowhere and hold there for a month until Fox News picked up somebody else.
[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:52.144]  They just manipulate the public, especially the Republican public with Fox News.
[01:17:52.204 --> 01:17:56.507]  It's amazing to me how Frank Luntz and the rest of these people manipulate the Republicans.
[01:17:56.727 --> 01:17:56.987]  Right.
[01:17:57.127 --> 01:17:57.908]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:17:57.968 --> 01:18:09.453]  Frank Luntz has been on Fox and, you know, manipulating that and talking to, you know, constantly bringing up somebody that, oh, I liked Trump before, but now I like Marco or I liked Ted Cruz before, now I like Marco.
[01:18:09.793 --> 01:18:14.495]  It seemed like every time I turned that on this morning, I flipped it on and that's exactly what's going on.
[01:18:14.515 --> 01:18:14.555]  So.
[01:18:15.643 --> 01:18:17.104]  We're going to get a count here in a little bit.
[01:18:17.645 --> 01:18:24.631]  A little bit of an update of what was going on with the Democratic Caucus here, is I sent in a photo of that, and that room was jam-packed.
[01:18:24.672 --> 01:18:28.936]  It wasn't as big as this room, it wasn't as big as the gym, but nonetheless it was packed.
[01:18:29.396 --> 01:18:36.883]  And a few minutes ago when I walked over there, they had currently counted the caucus goers for Hillary, and that count stood at about 135.
[01:18:39.435 --> 01:18:43.058]  And when I was over there, they were in the process of counting the Bernie Sanders folks.
[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:50.445]  But we should be able to give you actual numbers, probably from both these caucuses here at Fair Meadows Elementary in West Des Moines.
[01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:51.486]  Interesting.
[01:18:51.706 --> 01:18:55.510]  And, of course, we're still in the early stages, I think, of votes.
[01:18:55.650 --> 01:19:03.778]  In terms of this website that we're looking at here, I don't see a number that shows a percentage of locations or let alone...
[01:19:06.150 --> 01:19:14.015]  Okay, so that's how many have, is that what percentage have called in so far?
[01:19:14.035 --> 01:19:15.476]  Yeah, that's what's been turned in so far.
[01:19:15.816 --> 01:19:16.096]  Okay.
[01:19:16.677 --> 01:19:16.897]  Yeah.
[01:19:17.137 --> 01:19:17.617]  Oh, all right.
[01:19:17.717 --> 01:19:18.618]  It's in the front one there.
[01:19:18.738 --> 01:19:18.998]  Okay.
[01:19:19.518 --> 01:19:26.423]  So yeah, we're still waiting to see what happens, but right now they're showing Cruz as being slightly ahead of Donald Trump.
[01:19:27.182 --> 01:19:37.065]  Well, I'm sure that some caucuses have submitted their results because I'm sure there's a lot of many caucuses around Iowa that are smaller than this one.
[01:19:37.085 --> 01:19:41.567]  So let us take a break here and we'll see if we can get you guys some solid numbers to report here shortly.
[01:19:41.947 --> 01:19:42.227]  Okay.
[01:19:42.347 --> 01:19:42.707]  Alright.
[01:19:42.807 --> 01:19:43.407]  Thank you, Richard.
[01:19:43.588 --> 01:19:46.649]  Now guys, I have a special guest I want to bring here in studio.
[01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:51.810]  You guys know that Mrs. Clinton has been out there on the campaign trail and she's been very busy.
[01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.751]  She's too busy to go watch the Benghazi movie.
[01:19:54.051 --> 01:19:56.592]  But if you're watching this right now, Mrs. Clinton is in studio.
[01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:57.373]  Come on in.
[01:19:57.393 --> 01:19:58.354]  She looks hot today, too.
[01:19:58.374 --> 01:19:59.194]  She looks hot today.
[01:19:59.234 --> 01:20:00.396]  Hi there, Jakari Jackson.
[01:20:00.936 --> 01:20:02.798]  Oh, you got your southern accent going on.
[01:20:02.818 --> 01:20:03.899]  Well, I am in Texas.
[01:20:03.919 --> 01:20:04.840]  I'm caucusing from here.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:05.541]  That's how good I am.
[01:20:05.581 --> 01:20:07.323]  You go check the polls right now.
[01:20:07.563 --> 01:20:08.544]  It doesn't even really matter.
[01:20:08.584 --> 01:20:09.765]  I mean, you already know I won.
[01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.307]  I took all the money from George Soros.
[01:20:13.336 --> 01:20:16.479]  Mrs. Clinton, I know you're in no ways tired, but people have been concerned about your health.
[01:20:16.699 --> 01:20:17.820]  You're showing up late to debates.
[01:20:40.258 --> 01:20:41.099]  No, I'm fine.
[01:20:41.159 --> 01:20:44.341]  I'm a little lightheaded, but I think that's the Monsanto, too, as well.
[01:20:44.421 --> 01:20:45.962]  It's not from when you fell and hit your head?
[01:20:46.423 --> 01:20:56.170]  No, Mrs. Clinton, you were in the, it wasn't a debate, but it was a forum where somebody asked you about your husband's activities, about the allegations of all the victims.
[01:20:56.630 --> 01:21:00.173]  Do you have any concern that may impact your campaign?
[01:21:00.973 --> 01:21:02.094]  What difference does it make?
[01:21:04.836 --> 01:21:05.857]  I'm going to win anyways.
[01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:09.618]  I mean, I'm caucusing from Texas.
[01:21:09.878 --> 01:21:10.559]  I'm already winning.
[01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:11.540]  I don't even have to be there.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.280]  Come on.
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:13.081]  Well, you are.
[01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:16.263]  Let's take a look at your polls.
[01:21:16.523 --> 01:21:18.405]  I'm sure my caucus has turned out really nice.
[01:21:19.466 --> 01:21:21.167]  Right now, the numbers are still pretty good.
[01:21:21.227 --> 01:21:23.069]  Let's neck and neck with Bernie Sanders.
[01:21:23.349 --> 01:21:23.909]  What do you think?
[01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:26.091]  Once again, being beaten by a man.
[01:21:26.111 --> 01:21:27.892]  It's a real possibility here.
[01:21:27.933 --> 01:21:29.153]  Who said that I was a woman?
[01:21:30.855 --> 01:21:32.656]  I've been fooling all y'all for a long time.
[01:21:32.896 --> 01:21:34.037]  Clinton's little secret.
[01:21:34.097 --> 01:21:34.798]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:21:35.752 --> 01:21:37.494]  Victoria's not the only one with a secret.
[01:21:39.876 --> 01:21:47.243]  Well, I'm gonna go back over here and try to continue to get people Hillary for President, and I see you guys, you keep wearing those Hillary for Prison t-shirts.
[01:21:47.263 --> 01:21:48.404]  Those things really make me angry.
[01:21:48.424 --> 01:21:48.964]  Alright.
[01:21:48.984 --> 01:21:50.686]  Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Clinton.
[01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:55.651]  Okay, so... Well, hopefully she's not back in our IT department.
[01:21:56.231 --> 01:21:58.793]  Now, speaking of Hillary Clinton,
[01:21:59.815 --> 01:22:04.096]  So we've talked about this, how the State Department has said that they're going to hold on to some of her emails.
[01:22:04.116 --> 01:22:07.877]  They have the deadline is February 29th to release all of these emails.
[01:22:08.177 --> 01:22:13.339]  They were supposed to be releasing them at the end of every month, but they say, oh, we're going to save.
[01:22:13.399 --> 01:22:15.199]  We have these last 7,000 pages.
[01:22:15.739 --> 01:22:19.280]  And they were delayed by that snowstorm that happened.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:21.401]  So they weren't able to get all of the emails out.
[01:22:21.421 --> 01:22:22.621]  And of course, these are the ones.
[01:22:22.661 --> 01:22:23.921]  This whole thing has been a snowdrop.
[01:22:23.961 --> 01:22:24.402]  Right.
[01:22:24.902 --> 01:22:25.702]  Let's make that clear.
[01:22:25.862 --> 01:22:33.505]  Well, and of course, the whole issue is that now they're reporting that some of these emails are so top secret that they can't even release them.
[01:22:33.865 --> 01:22:37.946]  And then she comes out and says, well, they're doing it after the fact, so no one has any clue.
[01:22:37.966 --> 01:22:45.709]  It's amazing how she just continues to tell the same lie no matter how much
[01:22:46.289 --> 01:22:46.709]  Yeah, I think.
[01:23:05.954 --> 01:23:07.195]  After the fact, just some of those things.
[01:23:07.235 --> 01:23:14.800]  It was confusion, but some of it is malicious, and I never had any documents on my server that were classified before they got out.
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:20.083]  Well, now they're saying they have 22 top secret documents that's being reported by Fox News.
[01:23:20.844 --> 01:23:24.166]  And as you're saying, it has operational intel that puts lives at risk.
[01:23:24.226 --> 01:23:29.670]  And I love this scenario where you can do anything, and if it's deemed to be top secret, you just get away.
[01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:34.693]  You can literally get away with murder as long as somebody deems it too top secret to be revealed.
[01:23:34.833 --> 01:23:35.614]  Right, exactly.
[01:23:35.714 --> 01:23:39.257]  And then we have now a former top watchdog.
[01:23:39.877 --> 01:23:56.231]  They said the State Department is lying when it says it didn't know until it was too late that Hillary Clinton was improperly using personal emails and a private server to conduct official business because it never set up an agency email address for her in the first place and that this was all planned.
[01:23:56.411 --> 01:24:00.535]  Well, one of her defenses is to say, well, what the State Department has done is over-classified this stuff.
[01:24:00.555 --> 01:24:01.536]  And it's like, you know what, Hillary?
[01:24:01.977 --> 01:24:04.700]  You don't get to make that determination.
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:05.560]  Okay?
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:09.124]  That's like, you know, if I was to get pulled over by the police for speeding, I would say, you know what?
[01:24:09.184 --> 01:24:10.425]  These speed limits are just too low.
[01:24:10.746 --> 01:24:11.126]  Let me go.
[01:24:12.187 --> 01:24:17.272]  And of course, I'm not going to get away with that, but she's going to get away with that because her last name is Clinton.
[01:24:18.093 --> 01:24:19.595]  And she can just continue to lie.
[01:24:19.815 --> 01:24:25.278]  And to say that she was never, I mean, she was never assigned a state.gov email address.
[01:24:25.298 --> 01:24:26.419]  So everybody knew.
[01:24:26.479 --> 01:24:30.881]  It's not that she was given the option and then, oh, I just decided to use this one because it was easier.
[01:24:31.262 --> 01:24:37.325]  No, this was a deliberate means with which to bypass the federal records management there in the government.
[01:24:37.345 --> 01:24:38.386]  This was premeditated.
[01:24:38.686 --> 01:24:57.971]  Well if these are over classified then what she needs to do is just call up her former employees at the State Department and give them the same instructions that she used to give them via email and say well I want you to send this information to me so if it says classified on the top just cover that up and copy it over and send it on the fax machine anyway.
[01:24:57.991 --> 01:24:58.711]  Like with a cloth?
[01:24:59.531 --> 01:25:02.192]  Yeah, cut and paste this so that you can get this to me.
[01:25:02.312 --> 01:25:03.272]  I want you to send this to me.
[01:25:03.292 --> 01:25:05.392]  I don't care if it's secure or not.
[01:25:05.432 --> 01:25:08.053]  Just get that top-secret classification off the top.
[01:25:08.093 --> 01:25:10.553]  And that's essentially what she's telling the State Department now.
[01:25:10.673 --> 01:25:12.574]  Right, and that's the kind of president that she's going to be.
[01:25:12.614 --> 01:25:13.914]  What difference does it make?
[01:25:14.274 --> 01:25:20.115]  Cut all the corners and for your personal convenience, because she said that it's just easier to have it on her phone.
[01:25:20.455 --> 01:25:22.016]  Not that you couldn't access it from the phone.
[01:25:22.036 --> 01:25:23.216]  She had three phones, an iPad.
[01:25:24.116 --> 01:25:28.357]  Hey, didn't she have like a book that she put out that had a picture of her using her phone or a BlackBerry?
[01:25:28.477 --> 01:25:32.038]  Yeah, that was on the back of her bus, actually, when she was there for her book tour.
[01:25:32.558 --> 01:25:35.479]  They had a picture on the back of her bus with her, you know, shade.
[01:25:35.799 --> 01:25:40.460]  She's looking down at the phone like, you know, I'm so cool and I'm so trendy because I've got a cell phone.
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.760]  It's like, well, by the way, it was kind of trendy 15 years ago.
[01:25:42.781 --> 01:25:43.401]  That's it right there.
[01:25:43.421 --> 01:25:45.701]  It's the famous picture with her BlackBerry.
[01:25:46.561 --> 01:25:49.502]  But when she came out and said, I only had an iPhone.
[01:25:49.522 --> 01:25:52.203]  And then it's like, well, what about the BlackBerry also?
[01:25:53.283 --> 01:25:54.964]  He just lies and lies and lies.
[01:25:54.984 --> 01:25:55.844]  But what difference does it make?
[01:25:55.904 --> 01:26:00.206]  And of course her daughter is going right down the same path as her parents.
[01:26:00.227 --> 01:26:01.087]  Surprise surprise.
[01:26:01.287 --> 01:26:01.887]  Oh yeah.
[01:26:01.947 --> 01:26:07.510]  Chelsea Clinton says Republicans hate speech quote is far more troubling unquote than attacks on my parents.
[01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:16.054]  And they had a situation so in the Drudge Report where they they said Donald Trump has called your dad an abuser of women and your mom his enabler.
[01:26:16.495 --> 01:26:17.295]  What do you think of his attack?
[01:26:17.295 --> 01:26:17.615]  Exactly.
[01:26:41.209 --> 01:26:49.456]  The people that are claiming that they were sexually molested, harassed, and raped by Bill Clinton, and then saying that Hillary Clinton made it even worse.
[01:26:49.536 --> 01:26:50.797]  And so they're the ones who are saying it.
[01:26:51.117 --> 01:26:51.977]  It's not Donald Trump.
[01:26:52.198 --> 01:26:53.118]  It's not the Republicans.
[01:26:53.258 --> 01:26:54.680]  It's the victims, Hillary.
[01:26:54.900 --> 01:27:00.284]  But then she goes on to go right down all the typical Democrat shibboleths in one sentence.
[01:27:00.344 --> 01:27:09.131]  She says this is broad-based misogyny and sexism and racism and Islamophobia and jingoism and homophobia and anti-immigrant rhetoric.
[01:27:09.211 --> 01:27:10.312]  I'm quoting her directly.
[01:27:10.492 --> 01:27:12.595]  I mean, that's what she says, okay?
[01:27:12.615 --> 01:27:18.302]  She's like a robot who's like, glitch, glitch, glitch, just spitting out all those buzzwords.
[01:27:18.342 --> 01:27:19.944]  This and this and this and this and this and this.
[01:27:20.064 --> 01:27:20.605]  I'm done.
[01:27:20.965 --> 01:27:22.307]  I've toasted these guys.
[01:27:22.367 --> 01:27:23.889]  I've thrown every label at them.
[01:27:23.909 --> 01:27:26.432]  She ran through all of her talking points and now she has nothing else to say.
[01:27:27.253 --> 01:27:31.615]  According to Larry Nichols, Bill isn't even her dad, so maybe she just was like, uh, not my dad.
[01:27:31.655 --> 01:27:31.955]  I don't know.
[01:27:31.975 --> 01:27:39.798]  See, that's why I'd like to have seen the Democrat caucus, because I can just imagine that if they're going into one group or the other, the other group is yelling, sexist, racist, homophobe.
[01:27:39.898 --> 01:27:40.299]  Yeah.
[01:27:40.599 --> 01:27:42.059]  If you're a homophobe, you're over there.
[01:27:42.119 --> 01:27:44.160]  You've got to come over in this corner and sit with me.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:45.441]  You know, I mean, it's like...
[01:27:46.343 --> 01:27:46.924]  I don't know.
[01:27:46.984 --> 01:27:47.844]  That's what it's all about.
[01:27:47.864 --> 01:27:55.810]  And I think it's very fitting that they do the Democrat caucus that way because it's all about herd mentality, it's all about peer pressure, it's all about these ridiculous labels.
[01:27:55.830 --> 01:28:08.880]  They say they're against bullying and things like that, but then, you know, of course they're bullying you to come over into their... Well, they're liberal and progressive and accepting of other people's thoughts and viewpoints until they actually meet somebody with a different thought or viewpoint.
[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:11.702]  Right, and then they have to beat you into acceptance.
[01:28:11.822 --> 01:28:12.883]  Yeah, publicly shame you.
[01:28:13.892 --> 01:28:17.234]  One of the things I like about Donald Trump are his enemies.
[01:28:17.814 --> 01:28:21.716]  The fact that they are the enemies of my enemy and my friend, that type of thing.
[01:28:21.976 --> 01:28:25.778]  And of course, he has some really horrible people who absolutely hate him.
[01:28:25.858 --> 01:28:29.760]  One of them, a Saudi billionaire, who has connections with Fox Media.
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:32.982]  And of course, he says, knock out.
[01:28:33.582 --> 01:28:39.106]  Alaweed Ben-Talal caused a decline in Trump's popularity, says the headline.
[01:28:39.146 --> 01:28:41.387]  Well, actually, he hasn't been declining in popularity.
[01:28:41.787 --> 01:28:47.291]  And even if there's a narrow win here by Ted Cruz, I don't think that's going to make much difference.
[01:28:47.331 --> 01:28:52.914]  They were expecting up until the last day or so that Ted Cruz had been slightly ahead of Donald Trump.
[01:28:52.934 --> 01:28:56.497]  So they've been within the margin of error for the last several weeks.
[01:28:57.097 --> 01:28:59.518]  And we've got an update now from Richard Reeves.
[01:28:59.578 --> 01:29:12.982]  It's still hanging as they're getting more polls and it is still going about 30 percent Cruz and 27 percent Rubio and then 19 percent, I'm sorry, Trump and then 19 percent Rubio, Carson at 10 percent.
[01:29:13.082 --> 01:29:14.483]  Everybody else below that.
[01:29:15.123 --> 01:29:16.604]  So let's go to Richard Reeves in Iowa.
[01:29:16.644 --> 01:29:16.904]  Richard.
[01:29:17.984 --> 01:29:22.266]  OK, David, as we were talking about just a short while ago, Marco Rubio
[01:29:24.113 --> 01:29:32.800]  Blitz was going on here big time in Iowa on local TV, local radio, CNN, Fox, you name it, the Marco Rubio surge.
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:44.009]  And in this particular caucus, it apparently has worked because the tally for Donald Trump came up to 56 ballots and for Marco Rubio 108.
[01:29:44.290 --> 01:29:49.614]  You said a lot of people applauded for Rand Paul.
[01:29:50.074 --> 01:29:50.995]  What was his total?
[01:29:51.015 --> 01:29:51.996]  Was he low or high?
[01:29:52.839 --> 01:29:52.919]  It's
[01:30:09.474 --> 01:30:11.696]  The way they read the list was Jeb Bush, 18.
[01:30:11.816 --> 01:30:13.437]  Ben Carson, 17.
[01:30:13.777 --> 01:30:14.858]  Chris Christie, 8.
[01:30:15.418 --> 01:30:16.799]  Ted Cruz, 35.
[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.501]  Carly Fiorina, 1.
[01:30:18.881 --> 01:30:20.162]  Jim Gilmore, 0.
[01:30:20.682 --> 01:30:21.343]  Mike Huckabee, 4.
[01:30:22.464 --> 01:30:23.705]  John Kasich, 1.
[01:30:24.105 --> 01:30:24.685]  Rand Paul, 20.
[01:30:25.726 --> 01:30:26.767]  Marco Rubio, 108.
[01:30:27.727 --> 01:30:28.708]  Santorum, 4.
[01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.449]  Trump, 56.
[01:30:30.089 --> 01:30:32.651]  So Marco Rubio, first place.
[01:30:32.711 --> 01:30:34.532]  Trump, 56, is second.
[01:30:35.113 --> 01:30:36.114]  Ted Cruz with 35 is third.
[01:30:38.847 --> 01:30:39.568]  And fourth.
[01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:41.451]  Fourth is Rand Paul.
[01:30:41.631 --> 01:30:42.693]  Fourth is Rand Paul.
[01:30:42.773 --> 01:30:44.795]  So he is potentially a
[01:30:45.925 --> 01:30:47.486]  Looking at getting fourth or fifth.
[01:30:47.826 --> 01:30:55.788]  But the shocker today, obviously, is Marco Rubio, who has been AWOL from Iowa, basically, for the last two or three weeks.
[01:30:55.928 --> 01:31:03.290]  There haven't hardly been any Marco Rubio events until last Thursday's debate when he came in town and then he started doing some events.
[01:31:03.711 --> 01:31:12.193]  So the New World Order's mainstream control of the media, I think, can be credited with the results in this particular caucus.
[01:31:12.573 --> 01:31:14.774]  So let's just hope that's not repeated throughout the state.
[01:31:15.194 --> 01:31:20.061]  One of the things that concerns me about Marco Rubio, of course, is his neocon credentials.
[01:31:20.122 --> 01:31:28.995]  When the person made the speech for Marco Rubio, did he or she just continually repeat the word ISIS, or did they have anything else to say?
[01:31:30.481 --> 01:31:36.403]  Well, they did focus on security, but frankly, we were in the back corner of the room and it was very difficult to hear.
[01:31:36.423 --> 01:31:42.985]  There was no application system for the speakers, so there were a lot of people having trouble hearing.
[01:31:43.045 --> 01:31:48.466]  Even when we were very quiet, we had complaints about it, even the fact that we were whispering back in the corner.
[01:31:49.047 --> 01:31:55.108]  Well, it's interesting because I was two senators, or Republicans, and we got Joni Ernst, who just got elected in 2014.
[01:31:55.168 --> 01:31:57.669]  We have Chuck Grassley, who's a Republican.
[01:31:58.409 --> 01:31:59.090]  Grassley,
[01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:09.416]  Neither one of them officially endorsed anybody, but Grassley went to some Trump rallies and said, let's make America great again, that type of thing.
[01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:22.786]  And then Joni Ernst went to a Marco Rubio rally and essentially used all of his talking points about the fact that we have to go to war with everybody, but especially ISIS.
[01:32:23.346 --> 01:32:24.767]  And he had given her
[01:32:26.788 --> 01:32:33.174]  A lot of money from his super PAC when she ran this in 2014 when she got elected.
[01:32:33.914 --> 01:32:39.979]  So basically he has made some connections with some very powerful people in Iowa like Joni Ernst.
[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:54.532]  It's interesting, I think, that of this authorization for the use of military force, this new one that has been labeled, Alex Jones said it and then realized that a senator who saw this had the same label for it, an international martial law.
[01:32:55.412 --> 01:32:57.754]  The new authorization for the use of military force.
[01:32:57.795 --> 01:33:06.502]  It has no restrictions on the President as to where he can go, when he can go, how long he can stay and send troops to anywhere on Earth.
[01:33:07.103 --> 01:33:17.752]  And she is one of four co-sponsors for this bill that was introduced, kind of surprised everybody just before the snowstorm, by Mitch McConnell, the head of the Senate, Republican Senate.
[01:33:18.212 --> 01:33:20.394]  And Lindsey Graham was one of the ones who signed on to it.
[01:33:20.515 --> 01:33:21.636]  Joni Ernst was one of those.
[01:33:21.676 --> 01:33:30.004]  So she is part of this very strong neocon wing of the Republican Party, and so is Marco Rubio.
[01:33:30.064 --> 01:33:36.751]  So the militarized industrial complex really wants to see him move forward, I think.
[01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:37.372]  Right.
[01:33:37.392 --> 01:33:40.455]  Because it's certainly not what the American people want.
[01:33:40.735 --> 01:33:41.456]  Yeah, go ahead, Richard.
[01:33:42.216 --> 01:33:43.637]  Okay, real quick, because we've got to go.
[01:33:43.697 --> 01:33:45.939]  We're going to see if the Democratic caucus here is still going on.
[01:33:46.359 --> 01:33:48.240]  We'll give you an update when we find out anything.
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:53.424]  We've got to leave, but Grassley showed up at a bunch of candidates' events, so... Oh, he did, okay.
[01:33:53.444 --> 01:33:54.385]  Alright, so he wasn't.
[01:33:54.425 --> 01:33:55.686]  Alright, thank you.
[01:33:55.786 --> 01:33:56.086]  Thank you.
[01:33:56.126 --> 01:34:00.069]  That's Richard Reeves there on the ground in Iowa, and what he was telling us was that...
[01:34:01.058 --> 01:34:06.560]  Marco Rubio overwhelmingly won that caucus where he was attending.
[01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:14.284]  The second place was over 100 votes and it was about 50-something that Donald Trump got coming in second place.
[01:34:14.684 --> 01:34:17.585]  Third place was Rand Paul with 20.
[01:34:18.005 --> 01:34:19.666]  As we look at these results here,
[01:34:20.346 --> 01:34:24.648]  I think it is still, go over to the CNN results where they've got them there by percentages.
[01:34:24.768 --> 01:34:29.211]  We're still holding at 29% for Cruz.
[01:34:29.951 --> 01:34:30.491]  Trump is at 26%.
[01:34:30.991 --> 01:34:34.113]  So they're saying about 3% apart consistently.
[01:34:34.613 --> 01:34:36.954]  Rubio has moved up from 19 to 20%.
[01:34:37.875 --> 01:34:38.815]  Carson is at 10.
[01:34:39.235 --> 01:34:39.696]  Paul is at 4.
[01:34:40.256 --> 01:34:40.936]  Bush at 3.
[01:34:40.976 --> 01:34:42.097]  And everybody else is 2 or less.
[01:34:42.117 --> 01:34:43.878]  2% or less on the Republican side.
[01:34:43.898 --> 01:34:46.139]  And what's going on with the Democratic side?
[01:34:47.042 --> 01:34:50.244]  Yeah, on the Democrat side, just click that one right there.
[01:34:50.304 --> 01:34:51.144]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:34:51.304 --> 01:34:53.865]  I think it's really close.
[01:34:54.085 --> 01:34:57.627]  It's 51-49 with Clinton slightly ahead.
[01:34:57.647 --> 01:34:58.688]  Barely above Sanders.
[01:34:58.708 --> 01:35:01.709]  Well, this might be a good time to play my report.
[01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:05.251]  What is the difference between a Democrat versus Socialist?
[01:35:05.291 --> 01:35:09.713]  Since we do have them neck and neck, people just think, how could this happen?
[01:35:09.753 --> 01:35:11.174]  Where did Bernie Sanders come from?
[01:35:11.274 --> 01:35:12.875]  What is Democratic Socialism?
[01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:20.802]  And, you know, when I did a little bit of investigating, you find out there really isn't that much of a difference.
[01:35:21.302 --> 01:35:29.029]  And until socialists are able to get in a third-party vote, they just back the people who are the most like them, a la Hillary Clinton.
[01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:30.451]  So let's go ahead and play that report.
[01:35:31.564 --> 01:35:32.744]  This is the dynamic that I meant.
[01:35:32.844 --> 01:35:34.145]  I would just like to wake people up.
[01:35:34.565 --> 01:35:37.785]  Stop operating in their playground.
[01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:38.605]  Stop it.
[01:35:38.825 --> 01:35:39.406]  Well, let me say this.
[01:35:39.466 --> 01:35:40.686]  I totally agree with you.
[01:35:41.146 --> 01:35:41.766]  I've tried.
[01:35:41.966 --> 01:35:45.707]  I couldn't pay for the bandwidth to put all of our videos out on our own platforms.
[01:35:45.807 --> 01:35:55.669]  Now we're doing that at PrisonPlanet.tv and the Nightly News and putting ourselves up on television to reach people because it's kind of like jacking into the Matrix, going into their playground.
[01:35:56.049 --> 01:36:00.030]  I try to then claw them over here to see what we're trying to do, what you're trying to do.
[01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:01.290]  But I totally agree with you.
[01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:15.133]  The answer is for all of us to create our own systems, our own ideas, because vibrant, independent ideas will trump this corporate plastic borg, this brainwashing they're trying to push.
[01:36:15.193 --> 01:36:18.854]  I mean, banning father and mother, banning the word husband and wife.
[01:36:18.874 --> 01:36:25.076]  I mean, that's so cultic that if I'd have been told ten years ago they were going to ban words like that, I wouldn't have believed it.
[01:36:36.994 --> 01:36:45.363]  In an otherwise softball interview with Chris Matthews, Hillary Clinton seemed a little bit rattled when she was asked to explain the difference between a Democrat and a Socialist.
[01:36:45.843 --> 01:36:47.465]  What's the difference between a Socialist and a Democrat?
[01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:50.872]  Is that a question you want to answer or would you rather not?
[01:36:50.892 --> 01:36:54.234]  Well, you know, you'd have to ask... Well, see, I'm asking you.
[01:36:54.474 --> 01:36:55.935]  You're a Democrat, he's a Socialist.
[01:36:56.315 --> 01:36:58.136]  Would you like somebody to call you a Socialist?
[01:36:58.337 --> 01:36:59.577]  I wouldn't like somebody calling me a Socialist.
[01:36:59.597 --> 01:37:00.658]  But I'm not one.
[01:37:00.878 --> 01:37:03.020]  Okay, well what's the difference between a Socialist and a Democrat?
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:04.381]  Well, I can tell you what I am.
[01:37:04.821 --> 01:37:06.142]  I am a progressive Democrat.
[01:37:06.282 --> 01:37:15.548]  I'm a progressive Democrat who likes to get things done and who believes that we are better off in this country when we're trying to solve problems together.
[01:37:15.788 --> 01:37:18.330]  So this is the party's leading candidate.
[01:37:18.751 --> 01:37:26.038]  But Matthews was equally flustered last year when he asked the same question to the party's leading officer, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[01:37:26.498 --> 01:37:28.380]  What is the difference between a Democrat and a Socialist?
[01:37:30.891 --> 01:37:32.092]  I used to think there was a big difference.
[01:37:32.232 --> 01:37:32.913]  What do you think it is?
[01:37:34.554 --> 01:37:37.997]  The difference between... A Democrat like Hillary Clinton and a Socialist like Bernie Sanders.
[01:37:38.017 --> 01:37:40.719]  What's the difference between being a Democrat and being a Republican?
[01:37:40.739 --> 01:37:43.581]  What's the big difference between a Democrat and a Socialist?
[01:37:43.761 --> 01:37:44.982]  You're the chairman of the Democratic Party.
[01:37:45.022 --> 01:37:46.523]  Tell me the difference between you and a Socialist.
[01:37:47.224 --> 01:37:52.848]  The relevant debate that we'll be having over the course of this campaign is, what's the difference between a Democrat and a Republican?
[01:37:53.709 --> 01:38:00.192]  So it's really difficult for them to explain the difference because there is no difference in the current contemporary Democratic Party.
[01:38:00.572 --> 01:38:08.156]  So since Bernie Sanders came on the scene introducing this term Democratic Socialism there into the mainstream, people are rightly confused.
[01:38:08.556 --> 01:38:09.557]  Here is the gist of it.
[01:38:09.897 --> 01:38:10.737]  This is socialism.
[01:38:10.757 --> 01:38:20.982]  So the three core demands of the National Day of Action are free public college, a cancellation of student debt, and a $15 an hour minimum wage for people who work on the campus.
[01:38:21.282 --> 01:38:22.323]  And how's that going to be paid?
[01:38:24.934 --> 01:38:26.035]  Um, great question.
[01:38:26.055 --> 01:38:29.277]  Uh, I mean, you know, so...
[01:38:54.754 --> 01:39:04.718]  Now, the Democrats, they also agree, you know, they want equality for all, rule by the majority, and they pretend to believe that nobody should be too rich, right?
[01:39:04.798 --> 01:39:07.599]  Unless you're Hillary Clinton or part of the ruling class.
[01:39:08.419 --> 01:39:14.561]  And they also believe in a big, and I do mean a very big government, taking care of everyone.
[01:39:14.581 --> 01:39:20.183]  They want this huge welfare state, and of course, hoping that we're all going to need big government to take care of us.
[01:39:20.583 --> 01:39:26.846]  But presently this ideology is being pushed through in a very totalitarian way via the Democratic Party.
[01:39:26.906 --> 01:39:33.309]  So it looks very much like the totalitarian socialist society of the Hunger Games.
[01:39:33.429 --> 01:39:38.752]  That movie does an excellent job kind of foreshadowing what that society would look like.
[01:39:39.112 --> 01:39:42.634]  But let's take a look at the website of the Democratic Socialists of America.
[01:39:42.894 --> 01:39:46.796]  This is what they have to say about the Democratic Party versus socialists.
[01:39:47.136 --> 01:39:52.121]  So the question is, aren't you a party that's in competition with the Democratic Party for votes and support?
[01:39:52.642 --> 01:39:54.684]  No, we are not a separate party.
[01:39:55.044 --> 01:40:03.353]  Like our friends and allies in the feminist, labor, civil rights, religious and community organizing movements, many of us have been active in the Democratic Party.
[01:40:03.753 --> 01:40:07.417]  We work with those movements to strengthen the party's left wing.
[01:40:07.697 --> 01:40:13.543]  We hope that in some point in the future, in coalition with our allies, an alternative national party will be viable.
[01:40:13.903 --> 01:40:21.670]  For now, we'll continue to support progressives who have a real chance at winning elections, which usually means left-wing Democrats.
[01:40:22.131 --> 01:40:23.492]  I am a progressive Democrat.
[01:40:23.953 --> 01:40:26.595]  So what's the difference between a Democrat and a socialist?
[01:40:26.915 --> 01:40:31.500]  Well, the answer is there isn't a real difference anymore, but no one wants to admit it.
[01:40:34.028 --> 01:40:40.130]  Great report from Leanne McAdoo pointing out that there really isn't any difference between Socialists, Communists, Progressives.
[01:40:40.150 --> 01:40:45.611]  You know they use these different labels because what happens is people began to figure out what a Socialist is.
[01:40:45.651 --> 01:40:47.432]  So then they start calling them a Progressive.
[01:40:47.872 --> 01:40:52.093]  Now at the Democrat caucus there in Iowa right now we have Richard Reeves.
[01:40:52.433 --> 01:40:54.814]  I want to get an update from Richard as to what's going on there.
[01:40:54.994 --> 01:40:55.274]  Richard.
[01:40:55.714 --> 01:40:57.894]  Okay David, we've got you an update.
[01:40:58.335 --> 01:41:02.256]  A live time update here at Fair Meadows Elementary School here in West Des Moines, Iowa.
[01:41:03.852 --> 01:41:18.123]  Technically, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have tied because the way it works for the Democrats is they ultimately convert their numbers of actual bodies into a certain numbers of delegates per body count.
[01:41:18.483 --> 01:41:24.648]  So technically, when they count up the delegates, you have Hillary with four here and Bernie with four.
[01:41:24.748 --> 01:41:25.609]  It's a tie.
[01:41:26.009 --> 01:41:26.669]  Four to four.
[01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:31.613]  Now, I did get the official body count, and the official body count ended up being 137.
[01:41:33.055 --> 01:41:33.695]  That's the body count.
[01:41:33.715 --> 01:41:34.395]  137 Hillary.
[01:41:34.415 --> 01:41:34.716]  110 Bernie.
[01:41:34.736 --> 01:41:35.176]  Delegate counts.
[01:41:35.196 --> 01:41:35.796]  It's a tie.
[01:41:35.816 --> 01:41:35.836]  4-4.
[01:41:35.856 --> 01:41:37.116]  Very interesting.
[01:41:37.156 --> 01:41:37.717]  Thank you, Richard.
[01:41:37.777 --> 01:41:38.977]  Thank you so much.
[01:41:38.997 --> 01:41:40.497]  And you've got to get going now, right?
[01:41:40.517 --> 01:41:42.458]  So you're going to be signing off for the night?
[01:42:01.152 --> 01:42:09.020]  We are actually, well, we'll be signing back on, but we're actually going to the Trump Watch Party here in West Des Moines, so we should be coming back up here.
[01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:13.745]  We'll give you guys, as soon as we get over to the Trump Watch Party, we'll give you guys a heads up and come back on.
[01:42:14.165 --> 01:42:14.686]  Okay, great.
[01:42:14.786 --> 01:42:18.810]  And what you're saying, that's Richard Reeves at the Democrat Caucus there in Iowa.
[01:42:18.850 --> 01:42:21.953]  He attended the Republican Caucus and then went over and got an update.
[01:42:21.973 --> 01:42:22.834]  Thank you very much, Richard.
[01:42:23.474 --> 01:42:48.546]  And what he was telling us in the fact that in terms of delegate assignment, it was split 50-50 there on the Democrat side between Clinton and Sanders, but of course the Democrat Party is putting up the vote totals as well, and he gave us the vote totals there, so Clinton had a slight edge at that particular caucus, and what we're seeing right now across the state is that Clinton is at 50.8 and Sanders is at 48.6, but that may
[01:42:51.887 --> 01:42:52.928]  We're good to go.
[01:43:08.918 --> 01:43:11.540]  Well, it looks like it's going to be very close there.
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:15.682]  And again, in these early states, I think it's all the states that vote before the middle of March.
[01:43:15.702 --> 01:43:17.183]  I think it's March 16th or whatever.
[01:43:27.888 --> 01:43:36.615]  All the states that have their primaries before the middle of March, the delegates are awarded proportionally, and I think that's true in both parties, as far as I believe.
[01:43:36.635 --> 01:43:41.099]  That's the case in the Republican Party, and that's what's happening here in Iowa.
[01:43:41.479 --> 01:43:44.061]  But after that, it's going to start going winner-take-all.
[01:43:44.742 --> 01:43:50.126]  There's going to be a slew of primaries that are going to happen at the very beginning of March.
[01:43:50.607 --> 01:43:55.651]  We have four primaries and caucuses that are going to be happening in February.
[01:43:55.691 --> 01:43:56.652]  This is the very first one.
[01:43:56.852 --> 01:43:58.453]  Let's take a look at the Republican side.
[01:43:58.493 --> 01:44:00.274]  We've got Cruz up front.
[01:44:00.755 --> 01:44:01.435]  He is at 28.8.
[01:44:02.516 --> 01:44:04.637]  We have Trump at 25.2.
[01:44:05.198 --> 01:44:07.159]  Rubio at 21.2.
[01:44:07.479 --> 01:44:08.080]  Very close.
[01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:10.121]  Rubio is moving up close to Trump.
[01:44:10.842 --> 01:44:12.002]  That would be quite an upset.
[01:44:12.042 --> 01:44:13.443]  Well that's what Richard was talking about.
[01:44:13.524 --> 01:44:17.466]  Everywhere he goes he keeps hearing Rubio, the Rubio push, the Rubio surge.
[01:44:17.546 --> 01:44:22.710]  Even though he was really not looking so great after these few debates.
[01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:27.553]  Carson at 9.7, Paul at 4.5, and everybody else is way down.
[01:44:27.613 --> 01:44:29.635]  Bush at 2.8, everybody else is under 2%.
[01:44:30.095 --> 01:44:33.838]  And of course, with the Republican caucuses, they've got to count these votes.
[01:44:34.759 --> 01:44:35.539]  They're silent votes.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:38.121]  People put them in by hand.
[01:44:39.162 --> 01:44:46.067]  There's only 53% of the precincts in on the Republican side, so they're a little bit behind the Democrats.
[01:44:47.047 --> 01:44:48.649]  So we're still waiting to see what happens.
[01:44:49.731 --> 01:44:58.413]  And of course, it's also going to be interesting, even though they're counting the votes in the Republican caucus, it is still going to be proportioned in terms of delegates.
[01:44:58.593 --> 01:45:00.413]  So there's going to be a round off about that.
[01:45:00.713 --> 01:45:03.913]  So we'll see what happens with that.
[01:45:03.933 --> 01:45:06.694]  Now in terms of some other news, let's talk about something else that happened.
[01:45:06.714 --> 01:45:11.755]  This is an article that I saw over the weekend of the Drudge Report, Washington Post, eyewash.
[01:45:12.295 --> 01:45:15.315]  How the CIA deceives its own workforce about operations.
[01:45:15.835 --> 01:45:18.216]  Basically what this is, they call this eyewash.
[01:45:19.036 --> 01:45:20.498]  It was a CIA in the U.S.
[01:45:20.538 --> 01:45:24.902]  government that created the term brainwash, and they did that back in the Korean War.
[01:45:25.302 --> 01:45:33.991]  They had soldiers who had been captured, caught or captured, and they would do things and say things that would embarrass the American government, whether they were under pressure or whatever.
[01:45:34.271 --> 01:45:37.214]  The American government came up with a new term called brainwash.
[01:45:37.814 --> 01:45:40.456]  Mind control, okay, and everybody was captivated by that.
[01:45:40.476 --> 01:45:52.926]  The interesting thing is that it really wasn't mind control, but the people who were working on that very hard were DARPA and the American government, the Pentagon, and of course we have talked about compartmentalization.
[01:45:53.366 --> 01:46:05.516]  The fact that the people at top would have one agenda that they were working on, and everybody else below them would think that something completely different was happening, and that was very intentional, and that's what this is about.
[01:46:05.996 --> 01:46:11.401]  Washington Post is talking about eyewash, how the CIA deceives its own workforce about operations.
[01:46:11.421 --> 01:46:22.610]  They say senior CIA officials have for years intentionally deceived parts of the agency workforce by transmitting internal memos that contain false information about operations and sources overseas.
[01:46:23.230 --> 01:46:25.612]  This is according to current and former US officials.
[01:46:26.052 --> 01:46:27.754]  They call the practice eyewash.
[01:46:28.334 --> 01:46:29.734]  But now it's this eyewash.
[01:46:29.754 --> 01:46:30.815]  We're leaving eyewash.
[01:46:30.855 --> 01:46:31.535]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:31.555 --> 01:46:38.777]  Well, we have the article, you guys, you can pull it up right here, Curt Nemos, the CIA will openly propagandize Americans, and that's from a few years ago.
[01:46:38.877 --> 01:46:39.177]  Yeah.
[01:46:39.197 --> 01:46:48.180]  So it's nothing new, and when we talk about, you know, something like the CIA bringing in cocaine, I don't think the guys are sitting around at the company picnic, hey, Bob, how much cocaine did you bring in this month?
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:55.802]  You know, most guys probably didn't know what was going on, but there were enough guys involved at the top or, you know, whatever places that they need to be that allowed this to happen.
[01:46:55.862 --> 01:47:05.149]  Well, it's just like the DEA is probably telling all the agents that are on the lower rungs, no, this is for the pharmaceutical companies, all of these, this heroin and poppy seeds.
[01:47:05.169 --> 01:47:07.391]  I don't know what they told people about Iran-Contra.
[01:47:09.110 --> 01:47:10.430]  But Gary Webb figured it out.
[01:47:11.131 --> 01:47:26.656]  And you know, when we look at this, and we've had multiple sources telling us, we've had Steve Pchenik, we've had Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaffer, telling us that there were two different CIAs with two different agendas there at Benghazi.
[01:47:26.676 --> 01:47:27.736]  That was the background with this.
[01:47:27.796 --> 01:47:29.437]  And what they're saying is that, for instance,
[01:47:30.517 --> 01:47:43.724]  In one instance, leaders at CIA headquarters sent a cable to the agency station in Pakistan saying operators there were not authorized to pursue a potentially lethal operation against the alleged al-Qaeda operative known as Abu Zubaydah.
[01:47:44.144 --> 01:47:50.767]  But a second set of instructions sent to a smaller circle of recipients told them to disregard the other message that the mission could proceed.
[01:47:51.167 --> 01:47:58.809]  So here you have, you know, two different, you could even say it was two different factions, but it's not necessarily even two different factions.
[01:47:58.889 --> 01:48:06.151]  It's just that the CIA is telling one story to one group of people to have them do one thing, another group to do another thing, and so they're fighting against each other.
[01:48:06.171 --> 01:48:20.095]  So whether or not it is a confusion from the top, compartmentalization that's causing this issue, eyewash that's causing it, or whether there's internecine fighting going on within the CIA, this is what happens when we have a dark government.
[01:48:20.475 --> 01:48:27.080]  And these are the kinds of questions that are never even brought up in the presidential debates, because they would never question the national security state.
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:28.341]  Well, they don't have control over them either.
[01:48:28.361 --> 01:48:31.403]  Yeah, they would never question the national security state, they would never question the CIA.
[01:48:31.744 --> 01:48:42.592]  As you point out, if they try to come after the CIA, they'll be basically slapped down, just like they were when they came in with the Pike Commission hearings and the Church Commission hearings back in the 1970s.
[01:48:42.652 --> 01:48:49.377]  At that time, they knew that the CIA and the NSA were capturing the phone information of people even back then.
[01:48:50.998 --> 01:48:51.799]  45 years ago.
[01:48:52.359 --> 01:49:00.305]  And when the Pike Commission called in the NSA and they were asking, let's see your charter, I'm not going to show you the charter that I have.
[01:49:00.685 --> 01:49:06.969]  It's a secret executive order from President Truman that created the NSA and I'm not going to show it to the Congress.
[01:49:07.089 --> 01:49:08.690]  They're completely unaccountable.
[01:49:08.710 --> 01:49:14.294]  You know, these presidential candidates, pretty much their job is to give them a blank check and allow them to do whatever they want to do.
[01:49:14.694 --> 01:49:18.517]  You know, very few guys like Rand Paul are actually opposing the things that are going on.
[01:49:18.757 --> 01:49:19.417]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:20.077 --> 01:49:21.338]  It's a very sad situation.
[01:49:21.478 --> 01:49:24.458]  This is the kind of thing that will happen with secret societies as well.
[01:49:24.778 --> 01:49:27.439]  You only get to know as far up in the levels as you are.
[01:49:27.479 --> 01:49:37.722]  This is why, even regardless of what happens with the presidential campaign, unless we get involved at the grassroots level en masse, we're not really going to change anything.
[01:49:37.782 --> 01:49:39.762]  Joining us now is Alex Jones.
[01:49:39.882 --> 01:49:40.062]  Alex.
[01:49:45.487 --> 01:49:45.968]  Go ahead, Alex.
[01:49:47.349 --> 01:49:49.492]  Okay, we'll be back with Alex in just a moment.
[01:49:49.772 --> 01:49:51.074]  I think they're still getting set up there.
[01:49:51.254 --> 01:50:01.186]  Well, so yes, it's interesting because we know that even like this secret government here with the CIA, how they have their dark guys there, and that is how secret societies are run.
[01:50:02.307 --> 01:50:02.668]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:50:02.708 --> 01:50:07.615]  I mean, everything that's on the lower everyone on the lower rung is only allowed to know a certain degree of information.
[01:50:07.695 --> 01:50:12.402]  And then once you graduate to the next level, then you can say, Oh, that mission.
[01:50:12.522 --> 01:50:13.383]  Go ahead and proceed.
[01:50:14.144 --> 01:50:16.107]  Disregard everything you've learned up until this point.
[01:50:16.368 --> 01:50:16.868]  Exactly.
[01:50:17.469 --> 01:50:28.182]  What concerns me, too, is that this kind of thing, which has been going on now since World War II with the CIA, that is now the way that everyone interacts with you in government at any level.
[01:50:28.242 --> 01:50:33.929]  I mean, you go down and talk to the people who are running airport security and they won't talk to you because it's now secret.
[01:50:34.690 --> 01:50:36.372]  I think Alex is ready to join us now.
[01:50:36.472 --> 01:50:36.652]  Alex?
[01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:39.761]  Well, you're absolutely right, David.
[01:50:39.801 --> 01:50:43.283]  We have entered the national security state, and it doesn't make us secure.
[01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:45.585]  It makes us less secure.
[01:50:46.345 --> 01:50:49.387]  And that's what it was always designed to do.
[01:50:49.767 --> 01:51:05.438]  Ruling elites and banking families is take technologies of social control used in the third world, in Southeast Asia, in Latin America, in Africa, in Eastern Europe, and they have exported those now directly against the people of Europe and the United States.
[01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:35.246]  As they blow up the engine of liberty and free market innovation and development that gave them the combustion engine, the equations to create atomic weapons and power, that gave them the Wright Brothers, the Kitty Hawks, that gave them the power to create the internet, they've now stolen the Promethean fire of the grassroots, middle class, and working class people of every race, color, and creed in the American melting pot.
[01:51:37.009 --> 01:51:49.654]  And they have now basically come in and taken control of that system that are in a breakaway civilization right now.
[01:51:50.754 --> 01:51:51.715]  And so that's what's happening.
[01:51:52.775 --> 01:52:05.040]  This is really a question of does the elite really want to use technology and systems of control to dumb everybody down and stop the Promethean fire of progress from being trans people?
[01:52:07.228 --> 01:52:17.033]  Or be truly enlightened folks and believe in humanity and that if you're so enlightened, you shouldn't be afraid of other people being enlightened as well.
[01:52:17.653 --> 01:52:28.139]  But getting back to this key subject, pouring into the Iowa caucuses and Donald Trump in a dead heat with Ted Cruz and as we predicted Hillary a few points ahead of Bernie Sanders.
[01:52:30.606 --> 01:52:48.218]  I was doing Google searches tonight and I noticed a Salon article that is literally an organization that promotes pedophilia, the end of the family, just puberty, the opposite of liberals, the opposite of Thomas Jefferson, the opposite of human freedom.
[01:52:48.879 --> 01:52:54.423]  And it was an article about Donald Trump blows his cover, Donald Trump admits he's a fraud, Donald Trump admits it's all a scam.
[01:52:55.610 --> 01:53:02.232]  I don't have the headline in front of me, but it was something like Donald Trump, uh, you know, admits it's a, you know, you know, report proves he's a fraud.
[01:53:02.772 --> 01:53:08.233]  So I went and read the Politico report and it's called How Donald Trump Did It.
[01:53:08.513 --> 01:53:09.654]  We'll put that article on screen.
[01:53:10.714 --> 01:53:21.637]  And it's exactly what I heard from folks in New York, media people I know, folks that Donald Trump doesn't know.
[01:53:23.263 --> 01:53:27.024]  And so people ask why I'm still on Donald Trump.
[01:53:27.124 --> 01:53:40.228]  There's no way Donald Trump got people I know in Austin, Texas five years ago to talk about how he was aware of the New World Order and the plan to kill America.
[01:53:41.408 --> 01:53:45.629]  There's no way that Donald Trump pre-planned all that.
[01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:51.991]  And you read the article that Salon spins how Donald Trump did it from Politico.
[01:53:53.228 --> 01:54:02.553]  It's how two plus years ago, two and a half years ago, in 2013, he's there in New York, they want him to run for governor, and he's got 20 top Republicans in his office from the state.
[01:54:02.573 --> 01:54:02.993]  He says, listen,
[01:54:04.155 --> 01:54:07.637]  There are corporate interests ruining America that own our politicians.
[01:54:07.677 --> 01:54:08.697]  They're killing the country.
[01:54:09.377 --> 01:54:10.998]  I'm not going to stand here and watch this.
[01:54:11.338 --> 01:54:14.740]  Everybody falls down on their knees to the mainstream media when they're all a facade.
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:15.620]  I've seen it for myself.
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:22.883]  I'm going to go after them with no money from outsiders, knowing how to dominate their system and how to not coward to them.
[01:54:22.903 --> 01:54:26.805]  I'm going to destroy their system, showing it's a paper tiger and a facade.
[01:54:26.845 --> 01:54:28.186]  I mean, I was reading this article today.
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:29.640]  Yes.
[01:54:50.655 --> 01:54:51.456]  Listen to your show.
[01:54:51.516 --> 01:54:52.998]  You didn't know Donald Trump's one of us.
[01:54:53.018 --> 01:54:55.640]  And they go, Alex, we know you're the underground.
[01:54:56.241 --> 01:54:57.623]  We're like the overground now.
[01:54:57.703 --> 01:55:00.526]  We're doing what you said we should do.
[01:55:00.946 --> 01:55:05.411]  And I'm not here claiming that, you know, Donald Trump does everything I say and Donald Trump's an Alex Jones follower.
[01:55:05.451 --> 01:55:08.715]  But look at, you know, it's nothing less than Matt.
[01:55:10.410 --> 01:55:11.471]  I know how to talk
[01:55:38.851 --> 01:55:50.539]  To the number two in the Japanese government has been on the show, or the head of the German CIA has been on the show, or members of parliament have been on the show from England, from the UK.
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:59.345]  The bottom line is InfoWars, and what we do, and what all of you have done such a great job tonight doing, it isn't like you're following Alex Jones' drumbeat.
[01:55:59.906 --> 01:56:03.128]  It's a perspective that once you get outside the box, you see it.
[01:56:03.588 --> 01:56:07.251]  And a lot of times, David Niner, Jakari, or Leanne, or any of you guys,
[01:56:08.712 --> 01:56:09.812]  You see it clearer than I do.
[01:56:10.532 --> 01:56:11.793]  It's not like it's something special.
[01:56:11.913 --> 01:56:14.113]  Once you see it, you go, how did I never see that before?
[01:56:14.173 --> 01:56:22.955]  It's like the whole, you know, hidden image photo on the wall, the dot matrix, that once you see it, you say, how did I never see the guy playing the piano?
[01:56:22.975 --> 01:56:24.435]  Or how did I not see that design?
[01:56:24.455 --> 01:56:28.036]  Or how did I not see that bird, you know, that's in the picture on the wall?
[01:56:29.056 --> 01:56:35.857]  So imagine the evil of a group like Salon that to get attention has to have articles about how pedophilia is a great thing.
[01:56:37.773 --> 01:56:40.175]  Because they're so liberal, they think people have rights to your kids.
[01:56:40.275 --> 01:56:42.616]  You know, these are sick freaks.
[01:56:42.997 --> 01:56:45.158]  Having to say... Buckley, maybe Google it.
[01:56:45.178 --> 01:56:46.099]  I forgot the exact headline.
[01:56:46.119 --> 01:56:49.041]  It was like... Just type in Salon Donald Trump.
[01:56:49.061 --> 01:56:49.782]  It's the latest article.
[01:56:50.002 --> 01:56:52.443]  You know, report Trump proven to be a fraud.
[01:56:52.503 --> 01:56:53.104]  Something like that.
[01:56:53.924 --> 01:56:55.265]  And yeah, there it is.
[01:56:55.365 --> 01:56:57.167]  Trump... Donald Trump is a fraud.
[01:56:57.227 --> 01:57:02.851]  Report confirms the billionaire's presidential bid is long and calculated con job.
[01:57:03.971 --> 01:57:07.157]  But then you actually read what all these insiders said he was doing.
[01:57:07.177 --> 01:57:10.544]  This is what I was told by other insiders, that Trump is freaked out.
[01:57:11.586 --> 01:57:13.930]  He can't believe they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:14.551]  He's against that.
[01:57:15.623 --> 01:57:22.426]  You know, he can't believe that we make one side of deals to sell out our industry and shut down our coal power plants when nobody else shuts theirs down.
[01:57:22.726 --> 01:57:23.747]  He can't believe it.
[01:57:23.807 --> 01:57:34.732]  So he was this maniac son of German immigrants out making tens of billions of dollars, having fun with Miss USA and having all these hot Eastern European wives and stuff.
[01:57:35.793 --> 01:57:36.673]  He's not perfect.
[01:57:37.693 --> 01:57:40.455]  But the fact that he'd reach out to me through
[01:57:41.771 --> 01:57:47.633]  The fact that I go meet with other people and they go, you didn't know Trump was a listener years ago?
[01:57:49.614 --> 01:57:52.534]  And then there's Trump on my show saying, I will not let you down.
[01:57:52.674 --> 01:58:03.618]  Let me tell you, again, I'm not bragging, but when I was only on air two years, but at the top ratings in Austin, I was contacted by high level Democrats in Austin, like basically they have the Democratic Party in Austin.
[01:58:04.403 --> 01:58:05.644]  And they said, we want you to come to meetings.
[01:58:05.664 --> 01:58:06.364]  You're going to meet Bill Clinton.
[01:58:06.384 --> 01:58:07.505]  He's coming to town next month.
[01:58:07.545 --> 01:58:07.906]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:58:07.926 --> 01:58:08.966]  Don't talk bad about him anymore.
[01:58:08.986 --> 01:58:10.187]  We're going to really set you up in politics.
[01:58:10.547 --> 01:58:16.532]  And when I talk bad about Bill Clinton again, because I was playing C-SPAN clips of Chinese generals in the White House and these junkies.
[01:58:18.462 --> 01:58:20.983]  ...on C-SPAN said, OK, now you're gonna pay.
[01:58:21.623 --> 01:58:22.423]  Now you're gonna get it.
[01:58:22.523 --> 01:58:26.805]  And a few weeks later, five guys in a parking lot physically attacked me, saying, shut your mouth about Bill Clinton.
[01:58:27.065 --> 01:58:28.665]  They got me fired off local radio.
[01:58:28.705 --> 01:58:29.086]  You name it.
[01:58:29.446 --> 01:58:35.948]  So it's not just like Donald Trump reached his hand down to me, and I said, oh my gosh, somebody reached their hand down from on top.
[01:58:36.368 --> 01:58:39.789]  I didn't even watch the X-Files tonight, even though I'm the basis of a lot of the new stuff.
[01:58:39.949 --> 01:58:41.750]  Because it's kind of like, you know what, I don't need to be that.
[01:58:42.659 --> 01:58:44.924]  Culture's gonna follow what we do, not the other way around.
[01:58:45.024 --> 01:58:48.311]  We wag the tail, not the other way around.
[01:58:49.092 --> 01:58:53.281]  So, it was a big deal tonight when I read that.
[01:58:54.809 --> 01:58:55.970]  Trump admits he's a fraud.
[01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:59.233]  You read the article, it's him in a meeting going, forget the governorship, folks.
[01:58:59.453 --> 01:59:00.353]  They're destroying the country.
[01:59:00.373 --> 01:59:01.094]  They're taking over.
[01:59:01.114 --> 01:59:04.496]  We need to get America jobs back and not let NAFTA and GATT screw us over.
[01:59:04.837 --> 01:59:05.957]  I'm going to fight back against this.
[01:59:06.178 --> 01:59:09.540]  And this is what I was told five months ago, that no, Trump's awake.
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:10.701]  He knows what's going on.
[01:59:10.761 --> 01:59:13.783]  He is an egomaniac, but he actually wants to be the guy that saves America.
[01:59:14.684 --> 01:59:16.405]  That's why the Bilderberg group is so scared of him.
[01:59:16.425 --> 01:59:18.747]  That's why the whole elite is piling on against him.
[01:59:18.767 --> 01:59:20.348]  That's why they're doing everything they can to stop him.
[01:59:21.496 --> 01:59:22.677]  You think Trump's stupid, folks?
[01:59:22.717 --> 01:59:29.360]  If he gets elected and doesn't try to deliver now, he will be the lowest valued thing on earth.
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:30.981]  He will be the trash to be taken out.
[01:59:31.221 --> 01:59:32.181]  He's not going to do that.
[01:59:32.901 --> 01:59:35.142]  And that's why I think we're going to see an epic battle now.
[01:59:35.163 --> 01:59:36.903]  They're going to do anything they can to stop Donald Trump, folks.
[01:59:37.183 --> 01:59:40.625]  Just like they stopped Martin Luther King or Bobby Kennedy or JFK.
[01:59:40.885 --> 01:59:49.609]  Not that those men were perfect either, but JFK and Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, if you really read about him, he was better than those two.
[01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:50.390]  Martin Luther.
[01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:52.031]  You know, King Jr.
[01:59:52.311 --> 01:59:54.052]  They really wanted to empower humanity.
[01:59:54.092 --> 01:59:55.973]  They really... Kennedy cut taxes by 50%.
[01:59:56.093 --> 01:59:58.874]  You know, they really wanted to go to the moon.
[01:59:58.914 --> 02:00:00.635]  They really wanted to have civil rights.
[02:00:00.675 --> 02:00:02.556]  They really wanted to do something good.
[02:00:02.957 --> 02:00:05.898]  And these cold-blooded establishment people, they didn't want that.
[02:00:07.019 --> 02:00:10.441]  And so, here they are saying, this article discredits him.
[02:00:10.701 --> 02:00:13.402]  It's because this article in Politico certifies him.
[02:00:14.603 --> 02:00:17.805]  The fact that that was going on and that that was happening.
[02:00:18.585 --> 02:00:19.466]  And then I meet with
[02:00:21.147 --> 02:00:30.012]  Prominent people that I run into, that I've known for years, and they finally go, sitting there around their table at their home, they go, you know Donald Trump was here a few years ago and we talked about you.
[02:00:30.032 --> 02:00:31.433]  You know Donald Trump knows what's going on.
[02:00:32.073 --> 02:00:35.455]  You do your underground stuff, we'll do our above ground stuff, but we're going to save this republic.
[02:00:36.075 --> 02:00:37.916]  These aren't people giving me a con game.
[02:00:37.976 --> 02:00:40.198]  These aren't people that need to tell me bull.
[02:00:40.238 --> 02:00:44.080]  They know how dangerous I am politically, if you screw me over or this country.
[02:00:45.216 --> 02:00:47.757]  They know I'm a pit bull that will not back down, that will never stop.
[02:00:48.438 --> 02:00:55.521]  And the fact is, our spirit of liberty, just like Steve Pchenik, former head of Black Ops for the State Department said, like rock and roll came out of the South.
[02:00:56.718 --> 02:00:59.339]  A mixture of white hillbillies and black blues folks.
[02:01:00.179 --> 02:01:01.899]  It is coming out of the swamps of Texas.
[02:01:02.379 --> 02:01:04.940]  And it's not Alex Jones, but it's that spirit of telling the truth.
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:06.480]  That spirit of not backing down.
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:07.460]  It's infectious.
[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:09.561]  And it's spreading all over the world.
[02:01:09.621 --> 02:01:11.501]  It's the counter to the globalist cancer.
[02:01:11.801 --> 02:01:16.522]  Why wouldn't this pro-human message of liberty be positive in a time like this?
[02:01:17.142 --> 02:01:22.244]  Why, when great evil is coming, wouldn't there be people lifted up against it?
[02:01:23.104 --> 02:01:23.524]  And they won't.
[02:01:24.582 --> 02:01:28.445]  It won't be the perfect little fake Christian who says everything just right that opposes it.
[02:01:28.605 --> 02:01:30.066]  That's why evangelicals are going for Trump.
[02:01:30.746 --> 02:01:42.994]  So, I turned down the governor sending the state police over when he was getting ready to run for president of the Secret Service once he was the nominee, coming by AXS TV and saying, hey, the governor likes you, you ought to go to lunch sometime.
[02:01:43.154 --> 02:01:49.218]  Because my sister went to school with his daughter, she's 15 years younger and 14 years younger, and I've been at barbecues with Bush and all the rest of them.
[02:01:49.238 --> 02:01:50.119]  Big, big freaking deal.
[02:01:50.879 --> 02:01:52.821]  You know, I got invited out to Midland one time.
[02:01:52.841 --> 02:01:54.383]  Oh, you ought to come to one of the Bush Brothers' places.
[02:01:54.403 --> 02:01:55.264]  I've been on there two years.
[02:01:55.584 --> 02:01:56.585]  You've got a lot of talent.
[02:01:56.946 --> 02:01:58.027]  I didn't take their hand.
[02:01:58.267 --> 02:02:02.872]  I didn't go to the White House meetings like the other big talk show hosts, even later, because I knew it was fake.
[02:02:03.333 --> 02:02:03.953]  I had discernment.
[02:02:03.973 --> 02:02:07.357]  This Trump thing is real, but we have to make Trump ours.
[02:02:07.657 --> 02:02:10.661]  We have to make him break with the system fully.
[02:02:11.141 --> 02:02:12.221]  Because he's being educated.
[02:02:12.241 --> 02:02:13.302]  He talks about his cold feet.
[02:02:13.602 --> 02:02:15.443]  He talks about it means he's not sure at first.
[02:02:15.843 --> 02:02:17.324]  You know, will the country listen to him?
[02:02:17.664 --> 02:02:20.685]  And he's trying all his bravado, what he's seen work in the media.
[02:02:20.905 --> 02:02:21.705]  He admits all this.
[02:02:21.725 --> 02:02:23.106]  That's not who Trump is behind the scenes.
[02:02:23.906 --> 02:02:26.748]  He's doing that to a brain-damaged, dumbed-down public.
[02:02:27.928 --> 02:02:28.848]  Dumbing it all down.
[02:02:28.928 --> 02:02:30.309]  Playing a character for them.
[02:02:30.849 --> 02:02:32.570]  Hoping then that they resonate with him.
[02:02:32.590 --> 02:02:33.951]  And here's what I'm going to say in closing.
[02:02:33.971 --> 02:02:36.051]  And then throw it back.
[02:02:36.131 --> 02:02:36.612]  Numbers coming.
[02:02:36.632 --> 02:02:39.493]  Then I'll pop back in with Facebook mentions and a little bit more here in a little while.
[02:02:41.991 --> 02:02:43.712]  Donald Trump is the symbol of man.
[02:02:44.513 --> 02:02:47.655]  Just like Alex Jones is, or Darren McBreen is.
[02:02:48.255 --> 02:02:52.318]  We're, or Jakari Jackson, or Liam McAdoo, a symbol of humanity.
[02:02:53.079 --> 02:02:53.579]  We're here.
[02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:54.399]  We're not perfect.
[02:02:54.439 --> 02:02:56.881]  We don't have all the answers, but we know things are wrong.
[02:02:57.101 --> 02:02:58.922]  We know a scientific tyranny is coming into place.
[02:02:59.283 --> 02:03:06.548]  We're deciding to fight back with our oratory, with our skills, with our ideas against scientific systems of manipulation.
[02:03:07.495 --> 02:03:11.018]  And so that's why the Bilderberg Group and Davos openly say destroy Trump.
[02:03:11.658 --> 02:03:14.260]  That's why they openly say we must stop him.
[02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:29.511]  That's why, because they realize that whether he's real or not, whether he's perfect or not, none of us are, he represents resistance against tyranny like a Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., like a Bobby Kennedy or a JFK.
[02:03:30.856 --> 02:03:31.977]  Or Malcolm X for that matter.
[02:03:32.258 --> 02:03:40.588]  Because he represents that office and is the example of the grassroots rebellion, the explosion against tyranny.
[02:03:41.389 --> 02:03:47.697]  That even if he worked for Hillary, which I know he doesn't now, the guy he's going after, it wouldn't matter because what he changed just now...
[02:03:49.745 --> 02:03:51.846]  The death blows to the open borders.
[02:03:52.066 --> 02:03:57.069]  The death blows to selling our jobs overseas are so strong they go on past Trump.
[02:03:57.309 --> 02:03:59.090]  So what you get is banging a gong.
[02:03:59.830 --> 02:04:01.411]  Was the hammer hitting the gong real?
[02:04:01.491 --> 02:04:02.131]  It doesn't matter.
[02:04:02.211 --> 02:04:03.112]  It made the sound.
[02:04:03.632 --> 02:04:05.053]  And you can't un-ring that.
[02:04:05.113 --> 02:04:06.353]  See, it's spiritual laws.
[02:04:06.753 --> 02:04:08.154]  You judge a tree by its fruit.
[02:04:08.774 --> 02:04:13.196]  Even someone who's evil, who tries to pretend to be good, many times becomes good.
[02:04:14.337 --> 02:04:17.118]  Someone who is good, who pretends to be evil, many times becomes evil.
[02:04:17.138 --> 02:04:18.119]  These are the deeper secrets.
[02:04:19.403 --> 02:04:28.255]  You can reach out to the grassroots like this, at a real level, and challenge the whole system and be a fraud or you'll be destroyed.
[02:04:28.275 --> 02:04:29.797]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:04:30.498 --> 02:04:34.905]  If they can shoot Trump down, whether he's real or not, then they shoot down our hopes and aspirations.
[02:04:36.092 --> 02:04:46.239]  In this phase, we're fighting locally, we're fighting at the county and city level, we're fighting in ideas, we're fighting for medical rights, we're fighting for pro-life, we're fighting for lower taxes, we're fighting for national sovereignty.
[02:04:46.459 --> 02:04:48.781]  Donald Trump is not the end-all be-all of our war.
[02:04:49.321 --> 02:05:00.629]  But, just as he's hijacked the mainstream media, we hijacked the narrative of Donald Trump and bring his listeners and populists and that big 30-40% that wasn't politically involved into info wars.
[02:05:01.570 --> 02:05:03.171]  And Donald Trump brings us into his events.
[02:05:05.572 --> 02:05:06.052]  We're good to go.
[02:05:35.922 --> 02:05:36.162]  of course.
[02:05:58.092 --> 02:06:02.717]  On the CNBC debate and Trump leaving and now still at the head of Iowa.
[02:06:03.138 --> 02:06:03.818]  So let's go back.
[02:06:03.858 --> 02:06:08.463]  I'm going to be watching here obviously the latest returns from the Iowa caucuses as we go beyond.
[02:06:08.503 --> 02:06:09.124]  But here's the thing.
[02:06:09.585 --> 02:06:09.945]  Fighting.
[02:06:10.445 --> 02:06:11.106]  Standing up.
[02:06:11.547 --> 02:06:12.287]  Getting involved.
[02:06:12.988 --> 02:06:13.429]  Promoting.
[02:06:14.636 --> 02:06:14.876]  Thank you.
[02:06:34.059 --> 02:06:34.820]  But it is emerging.
[02:06:34.900 --> 02:06:35.540]  I mean, am I correct?
[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:36.861]  I looked 10 minutes ago before I went live.
[02:06:36.881 --> 02:06:40.784]  It's a dead heat between Trump and Cruz with Rubio at 23 or so.
[02:06:41.624 --> 02:06:44.306]  And then we've got Hillary about three points ahead of standards.
[02:06:44.326 --> 02:06:44.827]  Is that correct?
[02:06:44.967 --> 02:06:46.007]  That's correct, Alex.
[02:06:46.048 --> 02:06:50.150]  There's about three points between Cruz and Trump and another three points between Trump and Rubio.
[02:06:50.170 --> 02:06:56.215]  But of course, as delegates go, they're showing them right now on CNN that all three would get five delegates.
[02:06:56.475 --> 02:06:58.636]  Carson would get one delegate at 10 percent.
[02:06:59.297 --> 02:07:01.018]  Nobody else would get any delegates.
[02:07:01.038 --> 02:07:02.699]  That's the way that they would be apportioning that.
[02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:09.544]  77% of the totals have come in and what Alex was just saying, Alex you still there?
[02:07:09.564 --> 02:07:10.304]  Yes sir.
[02:07:10.704 --> 02:07:19.690]  What you were just saying about Salon trying to attack Trump and yet by doing so made him, showed him to be more authentic.
[02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:35.643]  I thought that was interesting because that's what I saw in that article in Politico where they were talking about his 18th century foreign policy, saying that we haven't had somebody that really stood up to put America first over the globalist interests since the 1940s with Taft, Robert Taft.
[02:07:35.903 --> 02:07:36.564]  He's not there.
[02:07:36.604 --> 02:07:38.005]  They don't like somebody they don't own.
[02:07:38.025 --> 02:07:39.186]  That's just what he said.
[02:07:39.206 --> 02:07:40.307]  Listen, I don't want their money.
[02:07:40.607 --> 02:07:41.488]  I'm not going with them.
[02:07:41.548 --> 02:07:43.370]  That's what they hate, is he's not a puppet.
[02:07:44.311 --> 02:07:45.352]  It's the return of a man.
[02:07:45.432 --> 02:07:46.773]  It's the return of a president.
[02:07:47.469 --> 02:07:56.935]  Well, he's still in a pretty good position here because if he gets the same number of delegates as everybody else, this is essentially, they're so close, two or three points down from the first place.
[02:07:57.235 --> 02:08:00.637]  That gives Cruz some bragging rights, but they're still neck and neck.
[02:08:01.077 --> 02:08:05.580]  And then they're going into New Hampshire and other places where... Where Trump's 15 points ahead.
[02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:06.740]  Yeah, where he's got a big lead.
[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:07.541]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:08:08.081 --> 02:08:09.383]  So I think it'll be interesting to see that.
[02:08:09.463 --> 02:08:19.297]  And Alex, also, there was another article that came out today, was linked to, on the Drudge Report from the Texas Tribune, talking about how the feds are planning to cut border monitoring by 50%.
[02:08:19.617 --> 02:08:23.543]  And so you've got governor, yeah, you've got governor, exactly.
[02:08:24.324 --> 02:08:28.068]  But they're going to take it down to even half of the ineffectiveness that it was last year.
[02:08:28.128 --> 02:08:36.218]  So you've got Republican Governor Abbott and Democrat Congressman Qualar asking Homeland Security, what are you doing?
[02:08:36.298 --> 02:08:40.103]  I mean this is bipartisan and they're saying this absolutely makes no sense.
[02:08:40.123 --> 02:08:41.265]  It's the implosion of the country.
[02:08:41.365 --> 02:08:42.226]  It's global government.
[02:08:42.586 --> 02:08:49.451]  Yes, they're going to use, they've already collapsed Mexico, they're going to use that to collapse the Southwest and bring in an international emergency with the UN.
[02:08:49.732 --> 02:08:50.472]  That's been the plan.
[02:08:50.492 --> 02:08:59.880]  If you go back to the Banff Canada documents 2007, the judicial watch student got, we cover it in my film Endgame, they say we're going to use border crisis, biological crisis like the flu,
[02:09:01.198 --> 02:09:07.460]  And that's it.
[02:09:07.981 --> 02:09:09.301]  That's what they're doing.
[02:09:09.321 --> 02:09:11.922]  I'm going to throw it back to you guys for the next 20 minutes or so.
[02:09:11.962 --> 02:09:14.283]  How long are we planning to go here as these numbers come in?
[02:09:14.303 --> 02:09:14.983]  Another 30, 40 minutes?
[02:09:15.623 --> 02:09:17.024]  Yeah, probably to the bottom of the hour.
[02:09:17.044 --> 02:09:18.504]  I think we'll have all the numbers in by then.
[02:09:18.524 --> 02:09:19.645]  I don't think they're going to change much.
[02:09:19.685 --> 02:09:22.686]  They haven't been changing as these numbers have been going up.
[02:09:22.706 --> 02:09:24.967]  So it doesn't look like Cruz is in a dead heat with Trump or ahead?
[02:09:25.489 --> 02:09:34.031]  He's had three points, he's got 28%, Trump has 25%, and Rubio has 22%, but the number of delegates that they get is the same.
[02:09:34.091 --> 02:09:35.991]  The top three would all get five delegates.
[02:09:36.051 --> 02:09:37.812]  But that's all according to... CNN.
[02:09:38.752 --> 02:09:38.992]  Sorry?
[02:09:39.372 --> 02:09:40.032]  That's all according to what?
[02:09:40.052 --> 02:09:40.972]  Microsoft's tallying.
[02:09:41.132 --> 02:09:41.992]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[02:09:42.012 --> 02:09:47.514]  Well, actually, we're trying to pull our Microsoft... it seems like the website has crashed.
[02:09:47.874 --> 02:09:48.674]  Does that come back up?
[02:09:49.354 --> 02:09:52.475]  So, you know, Rubio is there with a Microsoft tally.
[02:09:52.495 --> 02:09:54.495]  But of course, I think the interesting thing is...
[02:09:55.135 --> 02:09:59.819]  Is that this was a chance, this could have been the last stand for Cruz.
[02:09:59.859 --> 02:10:04.583]  It was absolutely imperative that he come out ahead even if slightly ahead.
[02:10:04.963 --> 02:10:12.450]  But he still has an uphill road to try to defeat Trump in terms of these remaining primaries coming up in this month.
[02:10:13.210 --> 02:10:21.660]  And it was also imperative for Sanders that he not lose to Clinton, because she seems to be leading in the rest of the contests that are coming up in South Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire.
[02:10:22.101 --> 02:10:27.648]  And so he really needed to at least look good here, and then also in New Hampshire.
[02:10:27.688 --> 02:10:29.029]  Then he would be on equal footing with her.
[02:10:29.069 --> 02:10:31.232]  But they basically have split this 50-50.
[02:10:32.673 --> 02:10:38.857]  It's 50.4% versus 49% for Sanders, and they're going to get the same number of delegates.
[02:10:38.917 --> 02:10:40.698]  And of course, O'Malley isn't going to get anything.
[02:10:40.738 --> 02:10:42.018]  He's at a half a percent.
[02:10:42.158 --> 02:10:43.659]  Listen, guys, I'm going to keep watching.
[02:10:43.679 --> 02:10:47.441]  I'm going to punch out here and there with Jakari, Leanne, and David.
[02:10:47.461 --> 02:10:49.462]  And all you have to say, and I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[02:10:49.482 --> 02:10:50.263]  Central, Lord willing.
[02:10:50.543 --> 02:10:53.026]  With a syndicated daytime show to break all this down.
[02:10:53.046 --> 02:10:55.549]  But remember folks, they're doing everything they can to not get this information out.
[02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:58.974]  To make sure nobody knows about Infowars.com or the new media.
[02:10:59.234 --> 02:10:59.915]  Spread the word.
[02:11:00.075 --> 02:11:00.796]  You have the power.
[02:11:01.096 --> 02:11:02.658]  Folks, you are the solution to all of this.
[02:11:02.718 --> 02:11:06.122]  And Trump is just a manifestation of the huge uprising against tyranny.
[02:11:06.303 --> 02:11:09.487]  Whether he's real or not, he is that manifestation, that figurehead.
[02:11:10.066 --> 02:11:10.566]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:11:10.766 --> 02:11:16.247]  That's Alex Jones, and we're going to continue to look at the returns as they come in until we get a little bit closer.
[02:11:16.267 --> 02:11:18.588]  I don't think anything is going to be changing much.
[02:11:18.628 --> 02:11:19.228]  It hasn't changed.
[02:11:19.248 --> 02:11:26.529]  We're at about 80% of those of the Democratic caucus that have come in, and it hasn't changed since it was about 50% or so.
[02:11:27.230 --> 02:11:28.650]  How about Darren McBreen?
[02:11:28.710 --> 02:11:30.510]  Does Darren have anything that he wants to comment?
[02:11:31.110 --> 02:11:31.310]  Kit.
[02:11:31.370 --> 02:11:32.411]  Kit is at the Twitter station.
[02:11:32.431 --> 02:11:33.331]  Let's go to Kit.
[02:11:33.391 --> 02:11:33.511]  Kit.
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:42.363]  Yes, I just got word about 10 minutes ago, uh, Martin or Malley is officially suspended his campaign for the nomination.
[02:11:42.932 --> 02:11:46.013]  Yeah, well that's not unexpected when you get a half a percent.
[02:11:47.133 --> 02:11:49.334]  That's about time to get off.
[02:11:50.514 --> 02:12:03.098]  Speaking about the Democratic race, this is a very good sign that I think the Democratic establishment is really freaking out right now because Hillary Clinton, she can't even really pull ahead from Bernie Sanders.
[02:12:03.158 --> 02:12:06.520]  I mean, she might win tonight, but maybe by one or two percentage points.
[02:12:07.460 --> 02:12:10.421]  So she's not that sellable anymore.
[02:12:11.181 --> 02:12:18.387]  And then she's got this whole email gate scandal just rolling around her head that she might be indicted.
[02:12:18.407 --> 02:12:21.210]  And I talked to Ron Paul this weekend at the Mises Circle in Houston.
[02:12:21.250 --> 02:12:23.551]  He said something I thought really interesting, the fact that...
[02:12:24.674 --> 02:12:29.135]  Uh, Lyndon B. Johnson dropped out of the race in 68 on March 31st.
[02:12:29.656 --> 02:12:32.316]  The race was on, the election was on November 5th.
[02:12:32.496 --> 02:12:34.597]  That's only about, that's still about two months away.
[02:12:35.217 --> 02:12:43.680]  So the Democrats, the establishment, they still have time to pull away from Hillary and, you know, get a new candidate in office if, uh, not in office but in the race.
[02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:46.301]  Whether it be Joe Biden or even John Kerry.
[02:12:46.421 --> 02:12:46.961]  Or Bloomberg.
[02:12:47.801 --> 02:12:48.482]  And that's the question.
[02:12:48.522 --> 02:12:49.603]  I don't really know if they can do it.
[02:12:49.623 --> 02:12:50.943]  We'll talk about when we come back.
[02:12:51.043 --> 02:12:54.406]  I'm not sure if they can get in if they haven't been in on the ballot.
[02:12:54.426 --> 02:12:56.187]  So there's deadlines for them to get on the ballot.
[02:12:56.447 --> 02:12:58.889]  I think that may be one of the reasons why they've got Bloomberg coming up.
[02:12:58.909 --> 02:13:00.009]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[02:13:00.029 --> 02:13:02.451]  We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back.
[02:13:19.013 --> 02:13:20.056]  I'm running for president.
[02:13:20.437 --> 02:13:23.664]  Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.
[02:13:23.945 --> 02:13:28.075]  I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.
[02:13:37.927 --> 02:13:38.949]  Brain Force is here.
[02:13:39.489 --> 02:13:41.772]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:13:42.053 --> 02:13:49.883]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:13:50.683 --> 02:13:53.845]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[02:13:54.145 --> 02:13:54.265]  Right?
[02:13:54.285 --> 02:13:56.627]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:13:57.007 --> 02:14:00.530]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:14:00.570 --> 02:14:03.732]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:14:04.232 --> 02:14:09.055]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:14:09.596 --> 02:14:11.417]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[02:14:11.777 --> 02:14:16.220]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:18.402]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:14:19.022 --> 02:14:20.503]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:14:20.643 --> 02:14:20.883]  Exactly.
[02:14:20.903 --> 02:14:24.927]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:14:25.228 --> 02:14:33.256]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:14:38.155 --> 02:14:43.157]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:14:43.377 --> 02:14:49.500]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:56.663]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:14:57.003 --> 02:15:06.929]  Now, Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[02:15:07.529 --> 02:15:13.453]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:15:13.693 --> 02:15:18.236]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:15:18.496 --> 02:15:21.897]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:15:22.117 --> 02:15:23.717]  No needles, no injections.
[02:15:23.997 --> 02:15:25.477]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:15:25.637 --> 02:15:26.758]  Try it for yourself.
[02:15:26.798 --> 02:15:28.818]  Discover the secret Secret 12.

[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:45.501]  What do you think the chances are that Joe Biden or someone else might enter the Democrat race if Hillary gets indicted?
[02:15:46.414 --> 02:15:47.515]  Well, I think they're pretty high.
[02:15:47.875 --> 02:15:49.377]  You know, percentage-wise, I don't know.
[02:15:49.477 --> 02:15:52.940]  But I bet if they're better than 50-50, they're going to need somebody else.
[02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:58.484]  Because the establishment Democrats are not going to accept Sanders.
[02:15:59.085 --> 02:16:05.410]  And it looks like right now that it must be really, really bad if they're going to dump an establishment person like Hillary.
[02:16:05.831 --> 02:16:08.593]  So I'll bet they're doing a lot of thinking and a lot of talking.
[02:16:08.673 --> 02:16:12.857]  And whether it's Kerry or Biden, who knows, or maybe somebody else,
[02:16:13.397 --> 02:16:26.249]  Some people say, well, it's awfully late for this, but you know, when Johnson dropped out, what was it, in 68, all of a sudden they had a candidate put up there, and that was, I guess at the time, McCarthy and McGovern and that sort of thing.
[02:16:26.409 --> 02:16:33.896]  So now they have time to put up another candidate, and I think they're seriously thinking about it, and probably the indictment might be the event that will
[02:16:35.658 --> 02:16:36.899]  Okay, and how's your son?
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:40.741]  He's busting his butt in Iowa with his campaign.
[02:16:40.781 --> 02:16:42.943]  Does he have a surprise in store?
[02:16:42.963 --> 02:16:46.305]  Do you think people, especially the mainstream media, are going to be surprised with his success?
[02:16:46.445 --> 02:16:48.206]  Well, it remains to be seen.
[02:16:48.306 --> 02:16:56.811]  I mean, it very well could happen, because the pollsters aren't known for their integrity, and they're usually biased.
[02:16:57.852 --> 02:16:59.433]  And the whole caucus system.
[02:16:59.933 --> 02:17:07.199]  You know, it lends itself to surprises and a well organized campaign can, you know, pull something off.
[02:17:07.239 --> 02:17:09.521]  So, I think he has a good chance to surprise a lot of people.
[02:17:20.623 --> 02:17:21.364]  We're good to go.
[02:17:49.867 --> 02:17:51.248]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:17:51.529 --> 02:17:52.810]  You can't survive without it.
[02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.911]  But where do you get it?
[02:17:54.231 --> 02:17:59.976]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:18:00.216 --> 02:18:05.921]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:18:06.121 --> 02:18:22.994]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:18:23.374 --> 02:18:25.495]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:18:25.856 --> 02:18:27.056]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:18:27.337 --> 02:18:28.097]  Easy assembly.
[02:18:28.357 --> 02:18:28.998]  Low maintenance.
[02:18:29.278 --> 02:18:31.099]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:18:54.028 --> 02:18:55.109]  It's never going to get any better.
[02:18:55.509 --> 02:18:56.230]  Don't look for it.
[02:18:56.670 --> 02:18:57.791]  Be happy with what you got.
[02:18:58.931 --> 02:19:01.993]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[02:19:02.554 --> 02:19:04.195]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[02:19:04.595 --> 02:19:05.636]  The real owners.
[02:19:05.716 --> 02:19:10.259]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[02:19:10.619 --> 02:19:11.860]  Forget the politicians.
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:15.362]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[02:19:16.943 --> 02:19:17.384]  You don't.
[02:19:18.144 --> 02:19:19.145]  You have no choice.
[02:19:19.505 --> 02:19:20.446]  You have owners.
[02:19:20.746 --> 02:19:21.667]  They own you.
[02:19:23.007 --> 02:19:24.289]  They own everything.
[02:19:24.529 --> 02:19:26.171]  They own all the important land.
[02:19:26.532 --> 02:19:28.294]  They own and control the corporations.
[02:19:28.314 --> 02:19:31.779]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[02:19:31.799 --> 02:19:33.401]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[02:19:33.722 --> 02:19:38.528]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[02:19:38.708 --> 02:19:40.351]  They got you by the balls!
[02:19:41.835 --> 02:19:43.917]  They want obedient workers.
[02:19:44.377 --> 02:19:45.878]  Obedient workers.
[02:19:46.198 --> 02:19:58.888]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[02:19:58.968 --> 02:20:02.231]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[02:20:02.691 --> 02:20:05.333]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[02:20:06.754 --> 02:20:07.675]  It's a big club.
[02:20:08.641 --> 02:20:09.501]  And you ain't in it.
[02:20:10.062 --> 02:20:12.762]  You and I are not in the big club.
[02:20:13.123 --> 02:20:15.063]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[02:20:15.723 --> 02:20:19.445]  It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[02:20:20.845 --> 02:20:22.366]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[02:20:22.386 --> 02:20:26.207]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[02:20:26.227 --> 02:20:30.168]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[02:20:30.188 --> 02:20:31.129]  They're not interested in that.
[02:20:31.389 --> 02:20:32.309]  That doesn't help them.
[02:20:32.709 --> 02:20:34.110]  That's against their interest.
[02:20:34.590 --> 02:20:35.030]  That's right.
[02:20:47.428 --> 02:20:50.014]  This is an American president.
[02:20:50.335 --> 02:20:54.104]  Just add puppet, then vote and repeat every four years.
[02:21:15.814 --> 02:21:19.616]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News live coverage of the Iowa Caucus.
[02:21:19.696 --> 02:21:32.042]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo, Ja'Kari Jackson, and we were just talking to Kit Daniels a few minutes ago when we played his report where he interviewed Ron Paul talking about whether or not the DNC might dump Hillary.
[02:21:32.122 --> 02:21:35.904]  Would they ask John Kerry to jump in the race or somebody else?
[02:21:36.044 --> 02:21:43.288]  And Ron Paul pointed out that in 1968, LBJ got out quite late in the process.
[02:21:43.328 --> 02:21:44.569]  I think he said in March.
[02:21:45.089 --> 02:21:52.232]  However, Kit, when I look at this, I think that they're not going to be able to pull up somebody like a Kerry or maybe even a Biden.
[02:21:52.652 --> 02:22:01.416]  Back in November, when people were questioning whether or not Joe Biden would jump in, they were saying that there's filing deadlines in various states that have been enacted.
[02:22:01.456 --> 02:22:03.758]  Of course, that's something that has changed significantly since 1968.
[02:22:05.098 --> 02:22:06.058]  We're good to go.
[02:22:24.924 --> 02:22:37.391]  But if you look at an independent candidate like Bloomberg, he says he's going to wait until March sometime to make his decision, because by that time, most of the states will have had their primaries or caucuses.
[02:22:37.811 --> 02:22:41.073]  He can wait until that point to see if he wants to get into the race.
[02:22:41.553 --> 02:22:44.195]  The earliest one, I think, is South Dakota.
[02:22:44.215 --> 02:22:45.476]  That's the end of April.
[02:22:45.496 --> 02:22:52.920]  But most of them are in August and September, the deadlines for signatures to get on as an independent candidate.
[02:22:53.715 --> 02:22:59.677]  Yeah, I mean, Bloomberg could very well be the next establishment candidate in case Hillary has to drop out.
[02:23:00.598 --> 02:23:03.058]  But, you know, that's the establishment candidate.
[02:23:03.078 --> 02:23:04.639]  It's not necessarily Democrats' candidates.
[02:23:04.899 --> 02:23:07.600]  I think Bloomberg was, what, a Republican when he was mayor of New York?
[02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:09.261]  He's definitely the establishment guy.
[02:23:09.281 --> 02:23:10.101]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:23:10.261 --> 02:23:14.683]  In case Hillary drops out and you've got a couple of guys that are kind of wild cards, like Sanders and Trump.
[02:23:14.723 --> 02:23:15.403]  And that's what he said.
[02:23:15.443 --> 02:23:20.825]  He said, if Hillary loses it, then I'm going to jump in because, you know, he would be the establishment guy.
[02:23:20.905 --> 02:23:28.427]  This is exactly why the establishment plays both, they own both parties, because if something like this happens, they could go to Marco Rubio on the Republican side.
[02:23:28.687 --> 02:23:32.488]  They might very well put a Republican in the White House, as long as it's the Republican that they want.
[02:23:33.028 --> 02:23:42.191]  As long as it's a Republican who's not going to change policy very much away from Obama's policy, who never changed policy very far away from Bush's policies.
[02:23:42.731 --> 02:23:43.071]  I agree.
[02:23:43.571 --> 02:23:47.692]  I think he would stay out if it was, let's say, Bernie Sanders and Marco Rubio.
[02:23:47.732 --> 02:23:55.034]  He might even stay out if it was Sanders and Cruz, because I'm not convinced that Cruz is an outsider.
[02:23:55.054 --> 02:24:00.435]  I mean, he's got all the Goldman Sachs connections, and he and Rubio have been in a race for getting the big money.
[02:24:00.695 --> 02:24:04.236]  Sheldon Adelson can't make up his mind as to which one of them he likes.
[02:24:04.296 --> 02:24:05.016]  The Koch brothers.
[02:24:05.196 --> 02:24:07.457]  I think he's very much in with the major globalist donors, right?
[02:24:07.677 --> 02:24:07.797]  Yeah.
[02:24:07.817 --> 02:24:09.097]  I mean, with Cruz, I tend to agree.
[02:24:09.137 --> 02:24:11.038]  I had issues with him when he ran for Senate.
[02:24:11.118 --> 02:24:11.578]  I think what?
[02:24:11.598 --> 02:24:14.519]  2012 because his wife having writing that white paper for the North American Union, you know,
[02:24:33.846 --> 02:24:45.497]  I was willing to give him a little bit of benefit of the doubt just because I think the Senate is so bought and paid for now that for anyone to get in the Senate, you know, after Rand Paul, you pretty much have to be on Goldman Sachs payroll.
[02:24:45.517 --> 02:24:48.119]  You know, I could be wrong, but that's just kind of my gut feeling about it.
[02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:57.230]  So, you know, I'm not completely throwing Cruz under the bus because of that, but I'm still very cautious about him just like you are.
[02:24:57.250 --> 02:25:04.699]  I'm not unhappy with the things that Cruz has done in the Senate, but I believe that he's taken a calculated look at what he can do and say
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:07.041]  And not have to have any consequences.
[02:25:07.081 --> 02:25:14.305]  In other words, he can call for the abolition of the IRS and the Income Tax Code as a senator, knowing that nobody else is really going to be a part of that.
[02:25:14.385 --> 02:25:28.432]  He can safely do that, just like he could come in and safely change his vote on the Trade Promotion Authority when he voted for it the first time, and then he could vote against it the second time, and it wouldn't really hurt him with his handlers.
[02:25:28.752 --> 02:25:32.014]  But I'm also looking at this, and I'm saying, okay, out of the top three guys,
[02:25:32.594 --> 02:25:34.195]  Cruz, Trump, and Rubio.
[02:25:34.395 --> 02:25:37.077]  Only Trump is a natural-born citizen, to my understanding of it.
[02:25:37.377 --> 02:25:39.419]  Rubio is an anchor baby.
[02:25:39.839 --> 02:25:41.300]  Cruz is born in Canada!
[02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:57.512]  I mean, this is absolutely insane, and especially when we looked at this, you know, eight years ago when Obama was running, and Republicans, for the most part, were very upset about the fact that, well, you know, we got a guy who only had one parent who was American, they were
[02:25:58.152 --> 02:26:00.213]  There were questions about whether or not he was born in Hawaii.
[02:26:00.273 --> 02:26:04.616]  I still don't believe he was with that photoshopped birth certificate that we saw.
[02:26:05.097 --> 02:26:07.538]  But nevertheless, he was raised in Indonesia.
[02:26:07.558 --> 02:26:07.898]  Right.
[02:26:08.279 --> 02:26:13.702]  And I mean, that doesn't necessarily, that doesn't make him ineligible if the other stuff were correct.
[02:26:13.842 --> 02:26:17.845]  I believe a natural born citizen has to be born in America with two American citizens.
[02:26:17.885 --> 02:26:19.706]  I believe that was the original intent statement.
[02:26:20.166 --> 02:26:32.013]  But still, the fact that he was raised in Indonesia, to my mind, would be something that would disqualify him, to me, right away as a voter, whether or not he was legally eligible.
[02:26:32.053 --> 02:26:35.115]  But now, Republicans just say, well, we don't really care about eligibility.
[02:26:35.375 --> 02:26:36.796]  We'll look at Rubio, we'll look at Cruz.
[02:26:37.694 --> 02:26:48.718]  Yeah, and one thing I will say about Cruz that I do like about him is the fact that he's at least, he's pushing the envelope as far as rhetoric, when he's pushing a lot of libertarian rhetoric ideas.
[02:26:48.778 --> 02:27:02.603]  I mean, like two years ago, for example, when he wrote, I think it was for the Wall Street Journal, he wrote that op-ed about Obama's imperial presidency, and he's quoting Montesquieu, and that's a name I haven't heard from anyone inside of Beltway for a very long time.
[02:27:03.263 --> 02:27:04.685]  Well, he's very intelligent.
[02:27:04.785 --> 02:27:07.407]  I just, I still don't feel like I can trust him.
[02:27:07.427 --> 02:27:10.090]  Like, Camille Paglia said he has shark eyes.
[02:27:10.170 --> 02:27:13.573]  And I know when we had that rally at the Alamo for open carry.
[02:27:14.134 --> 02:27:18.458]  He was, he was right, he was at the big hotel right across the street from the Alamo.
[02:27:18.498 --> 02:27:19.880]  We had a thousand people there.
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:21.782]  Open carry for the Second Amendment.
[02:27:22.142 --> 02:27:28.667]  It's like, where is your heart if you can just go to a blue-haired Republican lady fundraiser and not be at that rally?
[02:27:28.747 --> 02:27:35.472]  I mean, I was just absolutely stunned to find out that he was right across there holding a fundraiser at the same time he could care less.
[02:27:35.492 --> 02:27:40.296]  He didn't even come out and wave, you know, give a thumbs up to everybody about, yeah, Second Amendment, all right.
[02:27:40.756 --> 02:27:42.538]  He couldn't even be bothered to do that, okay?
[02:27:42.578 --> 02:27:45.620]  It's all about the money and the schmoozing and making connections.
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:45.960]  I don't think so.
[02:28:04.486 --> 02:28:05.287]  Well, it's interesting.
[02:28:05.327 --> 02:28:06.148]  We'll see what's going to happen.
[02:28:06.188 --> 02:28:08.490]  We've also got Richard Reeves.
[02:28:10.372 --> 02:28:12.994]  He's going through security to get into the Trump rally.
[02:28:13.735 --> 02:28:16.838]  In terms of the Democrat side and what we were talking about with Kit,
[02:28:18.597 --> 02:28:30.583]  Sanders went negative, according to a Wall Street Journal article that came out today, finally criticizing Hillary for having connections to Wall Street and a little bit of a criticism about the email stuff.
[02:28:30.603 --> 02:28:36.625]  He just can't bring himself to criticize her for this kind of fraudulent criminal behavior.
[02:28:36.645 --> 02:28:42.028]  He can talk a little bit about her fundraising and everything, and that's of course something that's legitimate to talk about.
[02:28:42.748 --> 02:28:57.064]  Remember, he had the opportunity, going back to the debates in October, to talk about this fraud at the criminal actions at Secretary of State with emails, and he said, I'm sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.
[02:28:57.445 --> 02:29:03.631]  Okay, but now he's saying, on Sunday, yesterday, he says, well look at the front pages in terms of what Secretary Clinton is getting slapped with.
[02:29:04.232 --> 02:29:08.173]  The guy just has no backbone, as far as I'm concerned.
[02:29:08.213 --> 02:29:18.296]  It's just amazing to me that he cannot bring himself, even when he's locked in a race like this, he can't even bring himself to get upset about these massive violations of the law.
[02:29:18.316 --> 02:29:19.337]  I mean, does it mean anything?
[02:29:19.377 --> 02:29:29.340]  Well, I've seen, I believe it was in the last debate, he was like, you know, we're better than the Republicans, we're not going to infight with each other, even though we see them fighting with each other all the time about, you know, various other things.
[02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:33.561]  Yeah, you know, it's this kind of ruse that they put out that they're more superior than the Republicans.
[02:29:33.621 --> 02:29:33.901]  Right.
[02:29:34.281 --> 02:29:40.003]  Well, it looks like on the Republican poll here on the CNN that they had starred Cruz's name.
[02:29:40.623 --> 02:29:52.587]  But I think it's interesting, as Richard was talking about the Rubio surge there in the Iowa caucuses, kind of interesting how we are seeing this surge and also the surge with Cruz.
[02:29:53.607 --> 02:30:14.478]  After those calls were made by the Financial Times editor and the other guy there with the large ties to the elite class saying we need to bring Trump down it's time to rally around our other guys that are our establishment guys and it's kind of interesting to see it playing out there with those two guys who have been fighting for who's gonna get the you know
[02:30:15.620 --> 02:30:23.205]  Yeah, they have basically let Rubio kind of draft the back of the pack, letting Cruz and Trump duke it out.
[02:30:23.765 --> 02:30:34.492]  And then, so while the two of them are fighting each other this last week, Rubio is kind of coasting behind them and then getting a big boost and a push from Fox News.
[02:30:34.552 --> 02:30:37.834]  And of course, we've seen this happen over and over and over again.
[02:30:38.174 --> 02:30:43.859]  Remember that it is Rupert Murdoch who is excited about the fact that he would love to see Michael Bloomberg come in.
[02:30:43.899 --> 02:30:45.540]  He says, best mayor ever.
[02:30:45.841 --> 02:30:51.666]  Yeah, the guy who's banning sodas and salt and all this other silly things.
[02:30:51.786 --> 02:31:02.875]  It's completely... The biggest nanny state person you can imagine has nothing but contempt for the Second Amendment, but also contempt for any idea of individual liberty there in New York City.
[02:31:02.935 --> 02:31:04.677]  And he doesn't think humans are capable of
[02:31:05.337 --> 02:31:13.705]  Governing themselves to the point where he doesn't even put salt on the table because you can't even control yourself to not put too much salt on your food.
[02:31:13.865 --> 02:31:16.127]  How do you get any more authoritarian than that?
[02:31:16.607 --> 02:31:18.189]  And that is very concerning.
[02:31:18.369 --> 02:31:22.172]  He said he would spend a billion dollars to run in a race.
[02:31:22.452 --> 02:31:26.236]  But again, as we were saying before, I really don't think he's going to get in.
[02:31:26.836 --> 02:31:29.497]  Unless there's no establishment candidate.
[02:31:29.557 --> 02:31:35.280]  If there's a Rubio or if there is a Hillary and even if there is a Cruz, I'm not so sure that he would get into the race.
[02:31:35.560 --> 02:31:36.961]  Definitely, I don't think he would get in.
[02:31:37.461 --> 02:31:39.482]  He said he's not going to get in if Hillary is in it.
[02:31:39.802 --> 02:31:44.564]  I don't think he would get in with Rubio and I even have my doubts about Cruz because again, I think that they are all
[02:31:45.704 --> 02:31:48.185]  That Cruz and Rubio are establishment candidates.
[02:31:49.005 --> 02:31:52.166]  They are supported by the big establishment donors like Sheldon Adelson.
[02:31:52.846 --> 02:31:58.248]  They are absolutely under the control of the Zionists like Sheldon Adelson.
[02:31:58.268 --> 02:31:59.388]  I mean, make that clear.
[02:31:59.448 --> 02:32:07.251]  Those guys, there is absolutely nothing that they will not subordinate for the cause of a foreign government.
[02:32:07.471 --> 02:32:10.812]  And to me, that is just absolutely traitorous that they would put another
[02:32:11.732 --> 02:32:26.739]  Yeah, and like that right there is just shocking to me, but those, the surge after of course we had those very high up figures there in the establishment putting out that call, it's time to take out Trump.
[02:32:27.293 --> 02:32:27.914]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:32:28.254 --> 02:32:31.577]  And again, this is a good time.
[02:32:31.797 --> 02:32:32.999]  Trump really needs to double down.
[02:32:33.039 --> 02:32:35.421]  He's talked a lot about Cruz's Canadian citizenship.
[02:32:35.441 --> 02:32:38.144]  He needs to talk about Rubio being an anchor baby.
[02:32:39.045 --> 02:32:46.091]  Because he talked about the anchor baby issue, to his credit, when he was talking about the border situation and so forth.
[02:32:46.111 --> 02:32:49.535]  We need to understand what a natural born citizen is.
[02:32:49.775 --> 02:32:53.257]  And we need to understand that anybody can file a lawsuit.
[02:32:53.357 --> 02:32:54.617]  Donald Trump could file a lawsuit.
[02:32:54.637 --> 02:32:57.219]  Somebody here in Texas has already filed a lawsuit against Cruz.
[02:32:57.799 --> 02:33:03.441]  There's been a lawsuit filed, I believe, in Florida against Rubio, saying that he is not a natural-born citizen.
[02:33:03.461 --> 02:33:09.684]  I think there's a very, very strong case that neither of them are eligible to run for president, and yet here they are.
[02:33:09.845 --> 02:33:10.005]  Right.
[02:33:10.105 --> 02:33:14.947]  And now weren't you pointing out that Rubio's parents weren't citizens?
[02:33:15.667 --> 02:33:15.967]  That's right.
[02:33:15.987 --> 02:33:19.189]  They were here in the country, but they weren't citizens yet when he was born.
[02:33:19.369 --> 02:33:20.350]  That's right, that's right.
[02:33:20.730 --> 02:33:28.395]  His citizenship came under the Anchor Baby understanding, which I don't think is correct, and that's a broader issue.
[02:33:28.935 --> 02:33:30.236]  They became citizens later.
[02:33:31.912 --> 02:33:32.773]  I don't think so.
[02:33:54.069 --> 02:33:54.410]  I don't
[02:34:12.422 --> 02:34:13.083]  And here's the deal.
[02:34:13.703 --> 02:34:19.348]  This guy wants to run on originalists interpreting the Constitution for the Supreme Court.
[02:34:19.488 --> 02:34:21.430]  He says, I believe in the Constitution as written.
[02:34:21.830 --> 02:34:25.193]  I believe in an originalist interpretation of it, a literal interpretation of it.
[02:34:25.513 --> 02:34:27.274]  What did they mean when they wrote the words?
[02:34:27.715 --> 02:34:29.616]  Okay, and we're going to go literally by the words.
[02:34:29.636 --> 02:34:32.939]  We're not going to go with the living Constitution document, okay?
[02:34:33.199 --> 02:34:33.880]  And that's the key.
[02:34:35.001 --> 02:34:40.187]  That's the hypocrisy that we see again and again with Ted Cruz, you know, flipping his position on issues.
[02:34:40.247 --> 02:34:45.993]  So, he believes in a literal constitution, he tells the conservatives, except when it comes to his own eligibility to run for president.
[02:34:46.334 --> 02:34:55.284]  In that case, he wants a living constitution that he can interpret however he wishes, not with what was written at the time and the commentaries and the understanding of what those terms mean.
[02:34:55.524 --> 02:35:00.247]  That's a very important thing because there's a different understanding today by most people as to what the militia is.
[02:35:00.307 --> 02:35:03.610]  But we know exactly what the militia means in the Second Amendment.
[02:35:03.850 --> 02:35:11.815]  So these terms that were not defined in the Constitution were clearly understood in the auxiliary documents and the debates that they had at the time.
[02:35:12.156 --> 02:35:16.158]  And that's one of the things that really concerns me about Cruz is again that hypocrisy that I see.
[02:35:16.178 --> 02:35:16.379]  Right.
[02:35:16.899 --> 02:35:20.782]  And it's interesting that you bring that up about the language because there is such a
[02:35:21.929 --> 02:35:25.971]  An effort to redefine words and to change the meaning behind words.
[02:35:26.091 --> 02:35:28.012]  Oh, that's the major strategy that they use all the time.
[02:35:28.233 --> 02:35:33.556]  Oh yeah, they'll say, you know, something like the Bill of Rights will say, and, or the or, you know, the comma.
[02:35:33.596 --> 02:35:34.996]  That's the thing that was in there one time.
[02:35:35.036 --> 02:35:39.359]  Well, the comma means that this is completely separate than what we would interpret it to believe today.
[02:35:39.439 --> 02:35:41.060]  It's, they go with all kinds of things.
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:44.001]  I'd like to make a comment about Marco Rubio.
[02:35:44.281 --> 02:35:45.142]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[02:35:45.482 --> 02:35:50.104]  His website's OpenSecrets.org on political donations.
[02:35:50.844 --> 02:35:55.707]  And this is for the Microsoft Corporation, which is, as we all know, is running the software.
[02:35:56.087 --> 02:35:56.407]  Tonight.
[02:35:56.447 --> 02:35:59.628]  Now for Republican candidates, now take a look at this.
[02:36:00.489 --> 02:36:02.610]  Look who's at the top for Senate.
[02:36:03.626 --> 02:36:04.306]  For donations.
[02:36:04.567 --> 02:36:05.447]  Marco Rubio.
[02:36:05.868 --> 02:36:06.088]  Wow.
[02:36:06.608 --> 02:36:06.808]  Wow.
[02:36:07.328 --> 02:36:12.432]  Yeah, he is the darling of big business of the big globalists.
[02:36:12.472 --> 02:36:13.473]  Make no doubt about it.
[02:36:13.873 --> 02:36:22.699]  Yeah, I think this chart here, I think this might explain why he's surging so well, despite the polls that says he wasn't going to surge quite as well right before the caucus.
[02:36:22.919 --> 02:36:23.660]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:24.280]  That's right.
[02:36:24.540 --> 02:36:28.124]  Yeah, Fox News loves him, Rupert Murdoch loves him, Microsoft loves him.
[02:36:28.164 --> 02:36:31.967]  They've put their money where their mouth is and now they put their mouth where their money has been put.
[02:36:31.987 --> 02:36:32.448]  Right.
[02:36:32.528 --> 02:36:35.971]  And now we see the results of it with Marco Rubio.
[02:36:36.071 --> 02:36:46.801]  And of course, talking about the nanny state, I mean it seems that Ted Cruz's efforts to harass people there in Iowa to get them out to vote must have paid off here.
[02:36:46.821 --> 02:36:48.002]  He sent out these
[02:36:49.063 --> 02:36:52.764]  Uh, these mailers that had, they were bright yellow with red on them.
[02:36:52.784 --> 02:36:56.685]  It says voting violation and it's like a report card.
[02:36:56.705 --> 02:37:05.888]  It would have the person's name on it and then all of his neighbors that also did not vote and they all got an F. An F in showing up to vote.
[02:37:06.268 --> 02:37:09.449]  If you don't show up for that caucus, we're going to put it on your permanent record.
[02:37:09.529 --> 02:37:12.410]  You and all of your neighbors are going to be publicly shamed.
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:15.042]  It's like out of Animal House.
[02:37:15.062 --> 02:37:15.363]  Yeah.
[02:37:15.383 --> 02:37:17.687]  You know, you're gonna be in super secret double secret probation.
[02:37:17.707 --> 02:37:18.568]  I mean, is this like...
[02:37:20.521 --> 02:37:23.802]  A foreshadowing of what the country is going to look like after?
[02:37:23.822 --> 02:37:24.602]  Incredibly childish.
[02:37:24.662 --> 02:37:48.390]  But you know, it's interesting to me that what I see in this race, besides the promotion behind the scenes of Marco Rubio, as Kit just pointed out, the number one senator that Microsoft puts their money behind, people counting the votes tonight, as well as what Richard Reeves pointed out, how he was being pushed relentlessly by Fox News, all the mainstream conservative media in this last week.
[02:37:48.930 --> 02:37:55.014]  I think he's drafted in underneath the conflict between Cruz and Trump fighting with each other.
[02:37:55.034 --> 02:38:03.180]  It'll be interesting to see if Cruz sees him as a threat, or if Trump does, and they start coming after him, because certainly Jeb saw him as a threat.
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:07.943]  Jeb saw him as taking his place, taking his donors, and that clearly has happened.
[02:38:08.223 --> 02:38:10.385]  Bush is basically out of it, folks.
[02:38:10.405 --> 02:38:10.925]  He's at 3%.
[02:38:10.965 --> 02:38:11.345]  Rand Paul is at 4%.
[02:38:11.385 --> 02:38:11.866]  Carson is at 9%.
[02:38:12.006 --> 02:38:13.907]  Carson gets one delegate.
[02:38:18.810 --> 02:38:22.492]  And Cruz, Trump, and Rubio each get five delegates.
[02:38:22.532 --> 02:38:24.153]  Nobody else gets any delegates.
[02:38:24.173 --> 02:38:25.093]  Cruz got six.
[02:38:26.374 --> 02:38:27.014]  Was that Cruz?
[02:38:27.314 --> 02:38:28.175]  Cruz got six.
[02:38:28.255 --> 02:38:29.916]  Okay, they've moved it up to six.
[02:38:30.016 --> 02:38:31.276]  Okay, they've adjusted that now.
[02:38:31.977 --> 02:38:32.357]  Okay.
[02:38:32.437 --> 02:38:35.158]  Six, five, five, one, and then zero.
[02:38:35.678 --> 02:38:38.380]  Yep, nobody else gets anything besides those top four.
[02:38:38.540 --> 02:38:38.780]  Right.
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:40.821]  And Carson just gets one delegate.
[02:38:41.101 --> 02:38:44.703]  And he's probably just there because of the evangelical Christians.
[02:38:45.501 --> 02:38:51.463]  I wonder where the extra delegate came from, because they've had it 555 and 1 for a long time, then all of a sudden they add a new delegate.
[02:38:51.683 --> 02:38:55.244]  I guess they may have updated the system here.
[02:38:55.264 --> 02:38:56.565]  Who knows?
[02:38:56.865 --> 02:38:57.725]  But that is CNN.
[02:38:57.965 --> 02:38:59.746]  We probably should find a more accurate source.
[02:39:01.006 --> 02:39:02.107]  Take a look at these things.
[02:39:02.127 --> 02:39:02.828]  Let's do his five.
[02:39:02.988 --> 02:39:04.529]  Have we heard from Richard Reeves?
[02:39:04.589 --> 02:39:06.090]  Is he at the Trump event yet?
[02:39:06.410 --> 02:39:09.012]  I'd like to get something from Richard before we go.
[02:39:09.032 --> 02:39:09.872]  They're setting up now.
[02:39:10.172 --> 02:39:10.833]  Okay, all right.
[02:39:10.873 --> 02:39:13.955]  He did get through the security though, and they're setting up.
[02:39:14.635 --> 02:39:18.538]  Let's play something from Dick Cheney about the Clinton email scandal.
[02:39:18.618 --> 02:39:23.861]  He says it raises some serious questions because, you know, Dick Cheney is Mr. National Security.
[02:39:24.242 --> 02:39:24.622]  Right.
[02:39:24.642 --> 02:39:26.363]  The most trustworthy guy in America.
[02:39:26.443 --> 02:39:27.264]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:39:29.845 --> 02:39:34.288]  But, you know, when you look at this, everything is sacrificed on the altar of national security.
[02:39:35.029 --> 02:39:49.499]  And if you're going to let Hillary Clinton get away with this because she's a Clinton or because she's powerful and can't be prosecuted, she's too big to jail, that calls into question all of the things that they're doing to take away our freedoms in the name of national security.
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:51.421]  We're good to go.
[02:40:06.229 --> 02:40:14.675]  Because he possessed unclassified documents that were basically just documents that they would use for training on his server.
[02:40:14.695 --> 02:40:15.956]  And of course, they were coming after him.
[02:40:15.996 --> 02:40:25.902]  It wasn't really so much a prosecution as it was a persecution, being one of the four NSA whistleblowers who were trying to get people's attention before Ed Snowden.
[02:40:26.023 --> 02:40:33.107]  And of course, most of the candidates here, except for Rand Paul, want to try Snowden as a traitor, they say, unfortunately.
[02:40:33.167 --> 02:40:35.049]  But do we have that report ready, guys?
[02:40:36.246 --> 02:40:39.090]  Yeah, let's play that Cheney talking about Clinton's email.
[02:40:53.070 --> 02:40:54.171]  Use the regular system.
[02:40:54.231 --> 02:40:54.891]  It's set up there.
[02:40:54.911 --> 02:40:56.533]  It's established for everybody.
[02:40:57.594 --> 02:41:05.159]  And certainly the senior officials of the State Department, the Defense Department, the White House and so forth are read into all of these.
[02:41:05.399 --> 02:41:07.201]  Why would you want to order a NORAD stand down?
[02:41:07.221 --> 02:41:10.323]  Would you want to have two separate systems?
[02:41:11.284 --> 02:41:12.184]  What difference would it make?
[02:41:12.204 --> 02:41:16.087]  It wasn't quite as up to date as it is today in terms of technology.
[02:41:16.708 --> 02:41:18.729]  But we had a basket outside the door.
[02:41:18.769 --> 02:41:19.010]  Turkey?
[02:41:20.339 --> 02:41:22.220]  Any electronic gear had to go in that basket.
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:22.720]  Wipe it?
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:25.081]  Like with a cloth?
[02:41:25.102 --> 02:41:34.887]  You didn't take it into the room because it could conceivably be reverse engineered or in some fashion threaten the security of what you were talking about.
[02:41:35.027 --> 02:41:37.308]  Oh yeah, so basically he's just spelling it out that...
[02:41:37.688 --> 02:41:39.450]  Clinton should have known better.
[02:41:39.510 --> 02:41:44.174]  I'm not a big fan of Dick Cheney, but it's not very hard for anybody, even Dick Cheney.
[02:41:44.194 --> 02:41:47.297]  I mean, you know, we can talk about the hypocrisy of what he's done.
[02:42:01.730 --> 02:42:03.792]  But what he said about that is absolutely true.
[02:42:03.832 --> 02:42:05.173]  This is a fundamental issue.
[02:42:05.293 --> 02:42:08.576]  Why would you have a private server here?
[02:42:08.656 --> 02:42:09.857]  What are you trying to hide?
[02:42:10.397 --> 02:42:18.583]  Her security and the things that she has to hide are more important than national security, is really what Hillary Clinton is saying.
[02:42:18.664 --> 02:42:21.206]  She's saying, my political secrets
[02:42:21.886 --> 02:42:22.106]  Are you?
[02:42:36.937 --> 02:42:45.463]  Well, if none of that is true, then let's just start rolling out this surveillance state and just saying it's just a total fraud, and it's just arbitrary, and it really doesn't matter.
[02:42:46.164 --> 02:42:47.725]  Maybe that's what we should do.
[02:42:48.065 --> 02:42:53.569]  Maybe we should just say this is total BS, and just shut it down.
[02:42:53.589 --> 02:42:54.690]  I'm all for that!
[02:42:54.730 --> 02:42:59.173]  Maybe I should vote for Hillary and we could shut this whole national security state down.
[02:42:59.394 --> 02:43:02.296]  Well, that's what the former Inspector General
[02:43:03.763 --> 02:43:12.765]  That was saying about that this was a premeditated thing with not setting her up an email from day one in order to avoid federal records management, but also pointing out... Of course it was premeditated.
[02:43:12.805 --> 02:43:15.645]  You don't just happen to stumble into a private email server.
[02:43:15.745 --> 02:43:15.905]  Right.
[02:43:15.925 --> 02:43:20.366]  I mean, how many people do you... How many of us have a private email server at home?
[02:43:20.546 --> 02:43:20.706]  How?
[02:43:20.746 --> 02:43:22.186]  Especially when we got a job like that.
[02:43:22.246 --> 02:43:25.547]  Especially when you're the top of the... Secretary of State.
[02:43:25.607 --> 02:43:28.887]  I mean, nobody briefed her on what procedures were or she just didn't care.
[02:43:29.147 --> 02:43:30.728]  And how... Hey guys, I got some breaking news.
[02:43:32.248 --> 02:43:34.670]  Bloomberg is calling the Iowa caucus.
[02:43:34.690 --> 02:43:36.771]  They're saying Ted Cruz wins over Trump.
[02:43:36.871 --> 02:43:37.371]  Rubio.
[02:43:37.391 --> 02:43:41.174]  They're saying that Rubio came in third, closing in on Trump.
[02:43:41.975 --> 02:43:48.199]  But what's really interesting in this article I see is Mike Huckabee has announced that he suspended his campaign.
[02:43:48.739 --> 02:43:53.042]  Yeah, Huckabee had said there was only three tickets out and he's, I don't know, how far down is he?
[02:43:54.957 --> 02:43:56.518]  I think he came in so far down the list.
[02:43:56.618 --> 02:43:57.999]  I don't even remember where I saw him.
[02:43:58.019 --> 02:44:00.160]  It doesn't show unless we scroll a couple of pages.
[02:44:00.900 --> 02:44:01.680]  So yeah, he's out.
[02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:02.141]  He's out.
[02:44:02.661 --> 02:44:03.421]  So I guess it's what?
[02:44:03.441 --> 02:44:05.983]  A couple more votes for Bush, maybe?
[02:44:06.323 --> 02:44:06.863]  Who knows?
[02:44:06.983 --> 02:44:07.944]  Who knows where they're going to go?
[02:44:07.984 --> 02:44:08.444]  Well, you know what?
[02:44:08.504 --> 02:44:09.304]  It's interesting, Cut.
[02:44:10.245 --> 02:44:13.426]  Huckabee and Santorum both showed up at the Trump rally, didn't they?
[02:44:13.446 --> 02:44:13.987]  Right.
[02:44:14.387 --> 02:44:20.630]  And I think they both knew that they were going to be down at 1% or less in the final results.
[02:44:20.650 --> 02:44:23.651]  Huckabee, he came in with 2% above Christie and Santorum.
[02:44:24.872 --> 02:44:31.939]  Santorum was dead last, Christie was next to last, and Huckabee was third from the last.
[02:44:33.781 --> 02:44:36.163]  Huckabee and Christie got 2%, Santorum got 1%.
[02:44:36.704 --> 02:44:38.426]  Nobody got any delegates out of those three.
[02:44:38.902 --> 02:44:46.604]  Yeah, he had said before if he didn't come in and third place or better, he was going to be out, and it never looked like he was going to come anywhere close to third place.
[02:44:46.624 --> 02:44:48.484]  And of course, Huckabee won back in.
[02:44:48.524 --> 02:44:48.884]  When was it?
[02:44:48.904 --> 02:44:48.884]  2008?
[02:44:48.924 --> 02:44:51.125]  Yeah, I believe so.
[02:44:51.145 --> 02:44:51.845]  That's interesting.
[02:44:51.885 --> 02:44:55.526]  I looked at just a couple minutes ago, looked at the past winners for the Republicans.
[02:44:55.586 --> 02:44:59.847]  I think it's almost about 50-50 as far as how many
[02:45:01.167 --> 02:45:03.750]  Iowa winners ultimately win the nomination.
[02:45:04.611 --> 02:45:08.695]  And I think in like 2008, John McCain, I think he only came in like third or fourth in Iowa.
[02:45:08.715 --> 02:45:09.395]  He came in fourth.
[02:45:09.415 --> 02:45:12.919]  He was actually behind Fred Thompson, and that's something to think about.
[02:45:13.620 --> 02:45:16.983]  Yeah, if you remember, David,
[02:45:18.004 --> 02:45:20.347]  John McCain was about to suspend his campaign.
[02:45:20.467 --> 02:45:22.890]  You know, he was about to close his last office, I believe.
[02:45:23.030 --> 02:45:23.971]  That's right, that's right.
[02:45:24.092 --> 02:45:27.656]  And then the establishment flocked to him and said, we will back you, you know, just stay in the race.
[02:45:27.676 --> 02:45:32.101]  We'll do whatever we can to ensure that you stay in the race and you look electable.
[02:45:32.282 --> 02:45:34.604]  Yeah, because they really wanted Barack Obama in there.
[02:45:35.505 --> 02:45:44.852]  Let's try to get this old, old white guy who's older than dirt, as he said about himself, and let's put a young, charismatic black guy in, because he's going to do everything we want.
[02:45:44.932 --> 02:45:53.017]  And I think a lot of Democrats, some Democrats realize that they've been betrayed by Obama, but I think most of them don't want to admit that.
[02:45:53.318 --> 02:45:55.279]  Well, he was elected on a bunch of lies.
[02:45:55.419 --> 02:45:59.802]  He promised he was going to do all this stuff that he didn't do, or is very slowly doing.
[02:46:00.162 --> 02:46:01.083]  Like transparency.
[02:46:01.263 --> 02:46:01.543]  Yes.
[02:46:01.623 --> 02:46:07.206]  He was going to have the most transparent, and of course the only thing transparent about his administration has been the criminality.
[02:46:07.727 --> 02:46:07.967]  Right.
[02:46:08.047 --> 02:46:09.928]  And he was going to really protect whistleblowers.
[02:46:10.168 --> 02:46:11.829]  Then he deleted that off his website.
[02:46:11.849 --> 02:46:16.572]  I remember Jakaria about two years ago, you and me, when we went to the UT campus, Obama was speaking.
[02:46:17.692 --> 02:46:20.194]  And they wouldn't even let us into the building.
[02:46:20.214 --> 02:46:24.296]  Jakari had a actual White House-approved press pass.
[02:46:24.816 --> 02:46:31.259]  Yeah, because rarely do, when we go to events like this, do we, you know, show up with press passes or get credentialed or whatever.
[02:46:31.279 --> 02:46:33.080]  Because the First Amendment is our press pass.
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:33.921]  But, you know, it was Obama.
[02:46:33.941 --> 02:46:35.021]  I knew they weren't going to hear that.
[02:46:35.342 --> 02:46:37.403]  So I actually went and I had my credentialed press pass.
[02:46:37.443 --> 02:46:38.343]  I got all of the stuff.
[02:46:38.723 --> 02:46:39.664]  Kid showed up there as well.
[02:46:39.684 --> 02:46:41.285]  You know, he's going to be my camera guy.
[02:46:41.685 --> 02:46:42.846]  And I get up there and they say,
[02:46:43.866 --> 02:46:44.367]  You can't go in.
[02:46:44.407 --> 02:46:45.468]  I'm like, what do you mean I can't go in?
[02:46:45.488 --> 02:46:46.510]  I got my press pass right here.
[02:46:46.530 --> 02:46:48.472]  And they said, oh, the Secret Service didn't approve you.
[02:46:48.913 --> 02:46:53.479]  So they were handpicking the guys they were going to let into the room with Obama himself.
[02:46:53.619 --> 02:46:53.819]  Yeah.
[02:46:53.939 --> 02:46:56.783]  We're going to get, what were we like, 400 yards away from the motorcade?
[02:46:56.823 --> 02:46:59.046]  We saw guys out there running around with snipers and all that.
[02:46:59.329 --> 02:47:10.893]  Yeah, they let the amnesty protesters that were demanding us end the deportations, they let them, the closest to Obama, they pushed the media, you and me, all the mainstream media back even further away than that.
[02:47:11.533 --> 02:47:21.617]  And the night before, I was on campus to try to shoot some footage of Bill Clinton when he was leaving a rally, not a rally, it was some speech, and I was talking to this mainstream
[02:47:22.810 --> 02:47:23.210]  I don't think.
[02:47:50.385 --> 02:47:54.990]  I'm not a supporter of Obama, as some people may know, but I don't think that that's Obama.
[02:47:55.470 --> 02:47:57.613]  I think that's an institutional paranoia.
[02:47:58.093 --> 02:47:59.074]  Let me give you an example.
[02:47:59.535 --> 02:48:03.519]  The Pope is coming close to El Paso, okay?
[02:48:03.899 --> 02:48:05.581]  Now, El Paso is on the American side.
[02:48:05.621 --> 02:48:09.586]  I don't know what the Mexican city is on the other side, but he's actually going to the Mexican city.
[02:48:09.986 --> 02:48:14.267]  But, it's only, where they're going to have the rally is just on the other side of the river.
[02:48:14.368 --> 02:48:22.890]  So, anybody that's in El Paso, any Americans that were there, they could easily go down to the river and just look right across it and they would be able to see the rally.
[02:48:23.431 --> 02:48:33.994]  In Mexico, they're encouraging everybody to come see the Pope, but on the American side, they're threatening people, saying you will not get any, they're going to cordon it off, they're going to keep everything away to protect the Pope.
[02:48:34.274 --> 02:48:35.635]  See, that's the difference
[02:48:36.235 --> 02:48:40.559]  Between the American security paranoia and what's going on in Mexico.
[02:48:40.879 --> 02:48:48.106]  So I would basically say to the people in Mexico, are you really sure you want to come across the border and live amongst this paranoid security state?
[02:48:48.126 --> 02:48:51.389]  That city is one of the most dangerous, it's like the murder capital there.
[02:48:53.311 --> 02:48:58.978]  So, I mean, you know, I think a lot of what you're seeing is going to get ramped up even worse the next time.
[02:48:59.319 --> 02:49:00.821]  Because it's just like what we saw.
[02:49:01.562 --> 02:49:06.408]  Every time there's a shooting or anything that happens, they go full-blown martial law.
[02:49:06.428 --> 02:49:09.231]  That's what we just saw up in Oregon with the shooting of LaVoy Finnecom.
[02:49:09.271 --> 02:49:11.074]  Here's a bunch of people out in the middle of nowhere.
[02:49:11.394 --> 02:49:31.211]  And he had said the day before he got shot, he goes, all of a sudden, we used to be able to have cordial conversations with the FBI, and now they won't talk to us, they get out of the car, they've got the guns drawn, he does this, and he goes, they're very confrontational, they have ramped up the number of people, they've ramped up the equipment, they're doing constant flyovers with planes and with drones, he goes, why all of a sudden the saber rattling?
[02:49:31.251 --> 02:49:32.633]  Why are they getting confrontational?
[02:49:32.653 --> 02:49:33.994]  Do they want to provoke violence?
[02:49:34.034 --> 02:49:35.115]  And of course, the next day they killed him.
[02:49:35.795 --> 02:49:41.221]  And so we see that kind of paranoia of the government security state, and I think it's only going to increase.
[02:49:41.561 --> 02:49:43.743]  It is independent, I think, of whoever is in the White House.
[02:49:44.804 --> 02:49:48.828]  Yeah, I mean, bottom line is that George Soros, we saw this in Ferguson.
[02:49:48.848 --> 02:49:52.612]  I tried to talk to a protest group up there that just got raided by the cops.
[02:49:52.872 --> 02:49:53.873]  I think Marcos was there.
[02:49:53.893 --> 02:49:59.638]  They wouldn't even, they let me, they made me sit outside for 45 minutes and then they told me they didn't want to talk to me.
[02:50:00.575 --> 02:50:05.776]  And sure enough, a couple of weeks later, we find out all these groups were being funded by Soros for like, what, I think $33 million.
[02:50:05.796 --> 02:50:13.838]  So what they're doing is they're trying to get the local citizens to fight against their local government.
[02:50:14.499 --> 02:50:18.119]  So then the feds can just take, go in and take, federalize everything, take power.
[02:50:18.780 --> 02:50:19.060]  Right.
[02:50:19.340 --> 02:50:24.821]  I mean, when you can't even work with your local government, that's when tyranny is really going to come into your community.
[02:50:25.501 --> 02:50:25.901]  Absolutely.
[02:50:26.141 --> 02:50:27.922]  So we're seeing that over and over again.
[02:50:28.482 --> 02:50:31.934]  Do we have Richard set up in the Trump...
[02:50:32.858 --> 02:50:33.778]  They're having some issues.
[02:50:35.279 --> 02:50:42.340]  You know what, I think basically what we'll do is have them make a report and file that report as to what they see there.
[02:50:42.620 --> 02:50:49.402]  I'd like to get that live, but if we're having some problems setting up, I don't... There's not really... I think we have got the returns as far as they're going to go.
[02:50:49.422 --> 02:50:54.924]  And again, to repeat that, we've got Ted Cruz at 28% with six delegates.
[02:50:54.984 --> 02:50:57.324]  We've got Trump at 24% and Rubio at 23%.
[02:51:00.805 --> 02:51:01.826]  Cruz gets six delegates.
[02:51:02.206 --> 02:51:03.447]  Trump and Rubio get five.
[02:51:03.767 --> 02:51:05.469]  Carson gets one at nine percent.
[02:51:05.669 --> 02:51:06.910]  Nobody else gets anything.
[02:51:07.250 --> 02:51:08.631]  Huckabee says goodbye.
[02:51:08.651 --> 02:51:12.074]  And we've had O'Malley say goodbye on the Democrat side.
[02:51:12.134 --> 02:51:14.376]  On the Democrat side, they are essentially tied 50-50.
[02:51:14.516 --> 02:51:19.320]  Let's pull that up and take a look at how the delegates are allocated on the Democrat side again.
[02:51:19.660 --> 02:51:20.921]  Yeah, it's really 50-50 now.
[02:51:22.262 --> 02:51:24.265]  Yeah, it is 50-50.
[02:51:24.525 --> 02:51:27.569]  It's a .2% split right now according to Microsoft.
[02:51:27.810 --> 02:51:30.233]  Wow, it is exactly 50-50.
[02:51:30.754 --> 02:51:36.101]  I wonder how come if they're 50-50, she gets 20 delegates and he gets 17.
[02:51:37.262 --> 02:51:39.185]  I guess it pays to know somebody, you know?
[02:51:40.386 --> 02:51:42.587]  I mean, that's what they're showing on CNN.
[02:51:42.807 --> 02:51:46.348]  They're showing them 50-50, but she gets 20 delegates and he gets 17.
[02:51:46.708 --> 02:51:48.468]  I guess she gets extra points for being female.
[02:51:48.488 --> 02:51:52.990]  She gets extra points for being a Clinton, that's what it is.
[02:51:53.050 --> 02:51:53.870]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:51:53.910 --> 02:51:54.870]  He's just an old white guy.
[02:51:55.410 --> 02:51:56.071]  And he is old.
[02:51:56.211 --> 02:51:56.691]  He's 75.
[02:51:56.971 --> 02:52:00.072]  He'll be 75 if he were to win the contest.
[02:52:00.652 --> 02:52:02.053]  Well, thank you for joining us.
[02:52:02.134 --> 02:52:04.576]  That's the end of our coverage for the Iowa caucus.
[02:52:04.756 --> 02:52:13.324]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo and Jakari Jackson and we'll continue to cover more developments as they come along with the presidential race.
[02:52:14.025 --> 02:52:14.666]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:52:49.053 --> 02:52:50.234]  Knockout is back.
[02:52:50.575 --> 02:53:01.685]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[02:53:02.066 --> 02:53:03.767]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:53:04.288 --> 02:53:04.989]  L-theanine,
[02:53:05.629 --> 02:53:13.374]  Hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[02:53:13.794 --> 02:53:15.555]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[02:53:16.115 --> 02:53:20.518]  It's the same price as leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece.
[02:53:20.978 --> 02:53:23.619]  It has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[02:53:24.180 --> 02:53:26.001]  It's got the GABA.
[02:53:26.701 --> 02:53:30.403]  So it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[02:53:30.904 --> 02:53:31.024]  It's $19.95.
[02:53:31.764 --> 02:53:34.106]  You take one or two of these,
[02:53:35.166 --> 02:53:38.469]  And it just is really clean, restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[02:53:38.789 --> 02:53:39.870]  It's what I've experienced.
[02:53:40.330 --> 02:53:42.692]  And it just synergistically puts everything in there.

[02:55:02.352 --> 02:55:09.596]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News live coverage of the Iowa caucus kicking off the 2016 election campaign.
[02:55:09.636 --> 02:55:10.237]  I'm David Knight.
[02:55:10.277 --> 02:55:13.198]  With me are Leanne McAdoo and Jakari Jackson.
[02:55:13.218 --> 02:55:16.900]  We're going to be covering this as the results come in.
[02:55:16.940 --> 02:55:19.542]  Now they have just started the caucus at this moment.
[02:55:19.962 --> 02:55:22.804]  Seven o'clock Central Time is when the Iowa caucus begin.
[02:55:23.504 --> 02:55:32.092]  They expect this year they're going to have results early, and that's something we're going to talk about, is what the caucus process is, and of course, Microsoft's involvement in this.
[02:55:32.112 --> 02:55:35.695]  We're also going to look back at the history of the Iowa caucus.
[02:55:35.715 --> 02:55:40.439]  We're going to look back at what has happened in the last couple of weeks with the debates, with the candidates.
[02:55:40.859 --> 02:55:47.385]  It's going to be a little bit more than just a horse race comparison, but of course, this is now the actual horse race begins.
[02:55:47.845 --> 02:55:52.988]  This is beyond the push polls, beyond all the pundits handicapping everybody.
[02:55:53.008 --> 02:55:54.229]  So now tonight it begins.
[02:55:54.569 --> 02:55:56.050]  Yeah, well, this will be very exciting.
[02:55:56.070 --> 02:56:03.055]  I know there's a lot of first timers out there at the caucus that can't wait to be heard and have their voices raised there.
[02:56:03.395 --> 02:56:06.257]  And we're going to be seeing a lot of peer pressure going on.
[02:56:06.297 --> 02:56:09.059]  I guess that's how the Democratic caucuses go.
[02:56:09.119 --> 02:56:16.604]  It's more kind of you pressure your groups into voting for yours or in the Cruz camp, you send out peer pressure mailers.
[02:56:17.544 --> 02:56:26.238]  Yeah, we'll also have Richard Reeves, who's on the ground out there in Iowa, so he'll have a chance to give us an eyewitness take and also talk to the great viewers who are actually out there in the area.
[02:56:26.599 --> 02:56:26.959]  That's right.
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:29.804]  Now tonight, we're going to take a look quickly at the difference between
