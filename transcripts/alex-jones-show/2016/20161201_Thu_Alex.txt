[00:00:04.978 --> 00:00:07.621]  The government wants you to view them as God.
[00:00:08.142 --> 00:00:12.529]  To do that, they attempt to reproduce the very attributes of God.
[00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:18.907]  God, Vermint, wants you to see it as omniscient, knowing everything about you.
[00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:23.129]  Omnipresent, its constant presence on the media.
[00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.770]  Cameras watching you everywhere, on your phone, on your computer.
[00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:31.892]  And as omnipotent, presenting itself as all-powerful and irresistible.
[00:00:32.753 --> 00:00:37.455]  This is why the police are becoming increasingly brutal and publicly getting away with it.
[00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:42.377]  This is the fog for what I would liken to Spectre, these global corporations to just take over.
[00:00:43.092 --> 00:00:43.632]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:00:43.732 --> 00:00:54.579]  And what it really does is it gives them all that power, having all that knowledge, then they now know how or who they have to deal with in their societies to be able to control the outcomes.
[00:00:54.959 --> 00:01:01.263]  That's really what I've been saying for several years, is that their whole idea is population control.
[00:01:01.863 --> 00:01:05.986]  And in order to do that, you have to have knowledge about the population, and that's what this is giving them.
[00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:11.909]  A security clearance to even be able to function and have a job, even in the private sector, I mean, this is beyond Hitler's...
[00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.611]  Best dreams, isn't it, sir?
[00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:19.013]  Oh, it's well beyond Orwell's in 1984, too.
[00:01:19.073 --> 00:01:30.378]  I mean, it's just total... It's getting into not only the things that you're doing and who you're working with and who you do those things with, but also what you're thinking, and that's really where this is heading.
[00:01:30.398 --> 00:01:39.343]  And then openly blackmailing you to submit and do everything you're told, or they will lower your social score so you can't operate in society and can't travel.
[00:01:40.243 --> 00:01:44.964]  Yeah, and if they can't get to you, they'll get to somebody you care about, just like the KGB did.
[00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:53.966]  On December 1st, 2016, the spy state will slip a Fourth Amendment violating procedure into the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
[00:01:54.026 --> 00:01:56.107]  Notice the term procedure.
[00:01:56.267 --> 00:02:01.088]  According to an article released by the Electronic Frontier Foundation back in April,
[00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:05.290]  The amendment to Rule 41 isn't procedural at all.
[00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.612]  It creates new avenues for government hacking that were never approved by Congress.
[00:02:10.812 --> 00:02:18.816]  The proposal would grant a judge the ability to issue a warrant to remotely access, search, seize, or copy data when the district
[00:02:18.996 --> 00:02:33.065]  where the media or information is located has been concealed through technological means or when the media are on protected computers that have been damaged without authorization and are located in five or more districts.
[00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:39.369]  It would grant this authority to any judge in any district where activities related to the crime may have occurred.
[00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:48.114]  The first part of this change would grant authority to practically any judge to issue a search warrant to remotely access, seize, or copy data relevant
[00:02:48.114 --> 00:02:54.279]  ...relevant to a crime when a computer was using privacy-protective tools to safeguard one's location.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:07.071]  All of those using a VPN service, or even those denying GPS location of their devices through a map app, for example, are subject to being implicated by the little-known procedural amendment.
[00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:11.615]  And while the federal hackers are hacking your device or computer with malware,
[00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:32.031]  Malicious hackers with far better experience hacking botnet devices will be hacking the federal government, causing any and all of your private data to be exposed simply because you were exercising your right to privacy, which is apparently a crime now, and all of it done with zero public debate.
[00:03:32.352 --> 00:03:41.239]  Two and a half weeks ago, it was discovered that there were 17 cell towers in the Southwest, the Southeast actually, that were fake cell towers.
[00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:50.527]  Uh, they were, uh, rather than transmitting phone calls directly to who you were talking to, they were planting software on the devices that you were using to connect.
[00:03:50.908 --> 00:03:54.170]  Well, you don't have to actually put a cell tower beside the road or on top of the mountain.
[00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.914]  You can put it in the back of your car and put an antenna on the top of your car.
[00:03:58.394 --> 00:03:59.234]  And be anywhere.
[00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:02.336]  And they look and sound exactly like real cell towers.
[00:04:02.796 --> 00:04:05.777]  These devices are manufactured by the Harris Corporation.
[00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:07.838]  And they're the only company that manufactures them.
[00:04:08.218 --> 00:04:17.141]  And they have a contract with all of their customers saying that the customer cannot talk about where they bought the equipment from or the fact that they own this equipment.
[00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:22.182]  Google was founded by the CIA and NSA on record 14 years ago.
[00:04:23.143 --> 00:04:25.684]  Apple is really a CIA front.
[00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:27.626]  Microsoft is pre-CIA.
[00:04:27.686 --> 00:04:30.187]  It's an IBM front that actually created the CIA.
[00:04:30.227 --> 00:04:31.108]  You might want to look into that.
[00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:33.169]  Who set up IBM?
[00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:34.010]  What its goal was?
[00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.373]  World domination, master race, eugenics.
[00:04:39.394 --> 00:04:41.935]  IBM was probably the main funder of Hitler.
[00:04:42.275 --> 00:04:44.017]  If you're a new listener, that sounds crazy.
[00:04:44.057 --> 00:04:44.877]  Just please look it up.
[00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:02.486]  Breaking News!
[00:05:02.747 --> 00:05:05.768]  California wants to succeed after a Donald Trump victory.
[00:05:05.968 --> 00:05:07.949]  Article up by the Sacramento Bee.
[00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.890]  Want to get away?
[00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.072]  Cal exits succession plan possible, but faces huge hurdles.
[00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:15.153]  Well, guess what, California?
[00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:17.354]  The rest of America's not your hurdle.
[00:05:17.534 --> 00:05:18.514]  Because we're all for it!
[00:05:18.794 --> 00:05:19.335]  Please!
[00:05:19.615 --> 00:05:20.375]  Leave now!
[00:05:20.635 --> 00:05:37.381]  Let's take all the good people out of there, because there's some good ones down there, and then we'll just dump the rest of Portland, and New York, and Miami, and Austin, and all the liberal hellholes, and we'll just dump them all in California, and we'll even help break away the land and push you guys out in the ocean.
[00:05:37.702 --> 00:05:38.682]  That'd be even better.
[00:05:38.862 --> 00:05:40.963]  You don't even have to have borders, because guess what?
[00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:44.064]  Nobody's gonna want to go there, because that sounds like
[00:05:44.264 --> 00:05:45.445]  Hell on earth.
[00:05:45.785 --> 00:05:53.111]  Now facing Donald Trump's imminent entrance to the Oval Office, the once outlandish idea of succession doesn't seem so crazy anymore to some Californians.
[00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:54.913]  Doesn't sound crazy to me either.
[00:05:55.213 --> 00:05:55.893]  See you later!
[00:05:56.114 --> 00:05:58.155]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com
[00:06:11.081 --> 00:06:19.017]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:22.164]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[00:06:22.964 --> 00:06:24.786]  And they're also very affordable.
[00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:25.146]  Exactly.
[00:06:25.166 --> 00:06:26.948]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[00:06:26.968 --> 00:06:30.311]  You talk about... We're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:31.632]  We've both talked to them.
[00:06:31.812 --> 00:06:40.780]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:42.762]  We refuse to screw people.
[00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:44.043]  We refuse to do that.
[00:06:44.423 --> 00:06:46.464]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[00:06:46.644 --> 00:06:53.688]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:54.849]  It's a win-win.

[00:07:31.488 --> 00:07:33.389]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:35.310]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.111]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[00:07:38.311 --> 00:07:39.131]  Alex Jones.
[00:07:39.211 --> 00:07:41.972]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:07:42.032 --> 00:07:45.254]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:07:45.274 --> 00:07:46.574]  Deeply I think racist.
[00:07:46.694 --> 00:07:48.535]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.436]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[00:07:50.456 --> 00:07:54.537]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:55.718]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:55.778 --> 00:08:00.720]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:08:14.737 --> 00:08:19.179]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:22.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:30.123]  We're only 50 days out from the inauguration of Donald Trump.
[00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:35.635]  And as I warned everyone weeks ago, the Democrats and the Globalists are not giving up.
[00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:38.876]  These people have overthrown countless nations.
[00:08:39.876 --> 00:08:51.461]  These corporate combines openly fund the most radical forms of Islam to butcher and murder millions of people during the Arab Spring across the Middle East and across Africa.
[00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:53.301]  They're not playing games.
[00:08:53.321 --> 00:08:54.342]  They're not giving up easy.
[00:08:55.082 --> 00:09:01.424]  We have to realize they are savage military enemies of this country and of free people everywhere.
[00:09:01.464 --> 00:09:15.010]  We have to harden ourselves against them and realize these are our sworn, absolute enemies that want to make us poor and break us and abort our children and poison our food and our water with their GMOs and fluoride.
[00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.351]  You understand they hate you and your family.
[00:09:19.452 --> 00:09:22.735]  The minute you start realizing that is the minute you turn the corner.
[00:09:24.136 --> 00:09:25.037]  They are globalists.
[00:09:26.378 --> 00:09:28.701]  What, you think they just stop at wars?
[00:09:29.321 --> 00:09:30.763]  Look at all their occult garbage.
[00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:35.707]  Look at all the pedophilia worldwide at the tops of these organizations.
[00:09:36.688 --> 00:09:38.050]  We're dealing with devils.
[00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:46.804]  And they've got all their useful idiots out there who watch mainstream TV and believe it's their right to ignore the people's vote.
[00:09:47.664 --> 00:09:53.666]  It's okay to vote and then have what you do stolen by the political party.
[00:09:54.546 --> 00:10:00.969]  Just like we saw the arrogance of George Will of the Washington Post saying we're going to ignore
[00:10:02.229 --> 00:10:10.110]  The majority vote for Donald Trump in the primaries because we don't listen to a mere plurality of the people or a majority.
[00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.711]  We listen to the sovereigns of the party.
[00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:13.891]  The sovereigns.
[00:10:14.971 --> 00:10:17.372]  These people believe their royalty, God's over us.
[00:10:18.032 --> 00:10:31.054]  And they run the gamut from mercenaries to arrogant pieces of tyrannical filth like George Will to the true evil that's above them that feeds on their fellow humans in a predatory fashion.
[00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:42.893]  So now, I have a clip where Paul Watson breaks down the fact that they've got electors lined up, ready to vote against Trump.
[00:10:43.454 --> 00:10:44.775]  And I can confirm this report.
[00:10:44.955 --> 00:10:53.441]  I was told over a week ago that they had 15 of the electors ready to jump ship, and perhaps more.
[00:10:55.462 --> 00:10:58.164]  Now they'd get 40-something folks, bye-bye Donald Trump.
[00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:04.292]  Now you're going to say, well he's elected, they'll never get away with it, it'll cause a civil war.
[00:11:05.313 --> 00:11:06.915]  That's what they want to do.
[00:11:07.635 --> 00:11:19.085]  They've got their people hopped up and whacked out of their brains, all because Donald Trump wants to try to cut taxes, and has brought Carrier Air Conditioning back, and has brought Ford back, and is about to bring Apple back.
[00:11:19.125 --> 00:11:20.266]  They want to be screwed.
[00:11:20.627 --> 00:11:21.468]  They want to be hurt.
[00:11:22.068 --> 00:11:23.088]  They want to be losers.
[00:11:23.468 --> 00:11:25.269]  They have mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:11:25.569 --> 00:11:26.589]  Learn helplessness.
[00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.570]  They worship the tyranny.
[00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:29.770]  They enjoy it.
[00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:30.831]  They have no lives.
[00:11:30.851 --> 00:11:31.791]  They have no future.
[00:11:32.031 --> 00:11:40.054]  But they associate their personal power, their entire identity, with MSNBC, with CNN.
[00:11:40.914 --> 00:11:42.374]  Now, they are a minority of people.
[00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:45.935]  Dumbed-down fools, manipulated from birth.
[00:11:46.335 --> 00:11:48.976]  They can be black, they can be white, they can be Hispanic, they can be Asian.
[00:11:49.496 --> 00:11:50.957]  What they are is fad-driven
[00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:59.581]  Idiots who believe that it's a cool idea to get on the bandwagon to try to block Donald Trump at any level.
[00:11:59.881 --> 00:12:04.725]  And they're going to do it at every front because, listen, the globalists almost had the United States destroyed.
[00:12:05.206 --> 00:12:06.547]  They almost had the UK destroyed.
[00:12:06.567 --> 00:12:08.668]  They almost had the European nations destroyed.
[00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:13.312]  They're continuing their program of impoverishing populations by design.
[00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:16.094]  The EU's own documents have been released decades ago.
[00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:17.976]  This is their plan.
[00:12:18.316 --> 00:12:19.316]  This is their program.
[00:12:19.356 --> 00:12:21.037]  They almost had us where they wanted us.
[00:12:21.617 --> 00:12:26.259]  The spider had almost gotten us completely tied up in its web so it could finally then have its meal.
[00:12:27.219 --> 00:12:30.641]  But America is now in its death battle.
[00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:46.047]  It's now in a death struggle, and so is the UK and others, against this scourge that weakens our society, that weakens our cultures, that dumbs us down, that nerve gasses us with the psychic propaganda that spews out of the television set.
[00:12:47.054 --> 00:12:52.157]  I'm telling you, you have to realize these are not just dupes at the high level doing this.
[00:12:52.197 --> 00:13:02.563]  They all, at the highest levels, consciously understand what they're doing and believe through sheer force of demonic will that it's their right to rule over us.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.282]  Now Paul Watson has another very powerful piece.
[00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:06.004]  We'll air it after this.
[00:13:06.024 --> 00:13:07.746]  Then we'll go back to David Knight.
[00:13:08.968 --> 00:13:11.212]  Dealing with Jill Stein as a complete idiot.
[00:13:11.913 --> 00:13:14.136]  And that's a viral term he uses to spread the video.
[00:13:14.917 --> 00:13:17.962]  But look, Jill Stein knows exactly what she's doing consciously.
[00:13:19.043 --> 00:13:23.745]  And Hillary keeps playing possum, and her lawyer comes out and says, don't be part of the recount.
[00:13:24.065 --> 00:13:28.087]  Meanwhile, she's got her ground troops in Michigan and other states launching the recount.
[00:13:28.867 --> 00:13:46.134]  So, they're trying to disrupt things, they're trying to create some numbers in states that he won, to look like he may have stolen something, to add legitimacy to these electors, which they've already organized, when they make their announcement that, oh, because it looks like the vote is in question, we're now
[00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.251]  We're now swinging against Trump and for Hillary.
[00:13:51.671 --> 00:14:01.554]  But they were already organizing day one to pull the electors from the Electoral College before they went and started the recounts that haven't even begun in most of these states.
[00:14:02.254 --> 00:14:03.214]  So it's on, folks.
[00:14:03.574 --> 00:14:04.214]  Understand this.
[00:14:04.234 --> 00:14:04.995]  This is serious.
[00:14:05.775 --> 00:14:06.455]  This is real.
[00:14:06.855 --> 00:14:10.696]  And they mean business to bare minimum destabilize the country further.
[00:14:11.096 --> 00:14:20.418]  And George Soros has got his proxy armies of Black Lives Matter, the jihadis, and others like the communists activated and rolling out and ready.
[00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:29.421]  And the mainstream media, just like they backed the Arab Spring and Anderson Cooper said how great it was, will praise them as they burn cities to the ground.
[00:14:30.612 --> 00:14:33.453]  Look, we got Trump elected so far, but he's not in office yet.
[00:14:33.913 --> 00:14:35.634]  And there's many battles yet to come.
[00:14:36.034 --> 00:14:38.155]  But his sin is that he's not out to get America.
[00:14:38.695 --> 00:14:42.676]  His sin is that he wants Americanism, not globalism.
[00:14:43.056 --> 00:14:46.338]  And that's why this is such an incredible and amazing time to be alive.
[00:14:46.358 --> 00:14:53.180]  But it's time to get focused, it's time to get angry, and it's time to spread the word of the information war like you never have.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.462]  Not just spreading our videos, not just spreading our articles, but also
[00:14:58.682 --> 00:15:13.684]  On the ground with posters, and micro-FM, and calling in the talk shows, and calling in the C-SPAN, and marching, and going out and engaging these anti-Trump people, and really lovingly, but very focused, getting in their face and saying, break your conditioning, fool.
[00:15:14.545 --> 00:15:17.366]  Because most of them have only gone off the peer pressure of mainstream media.
[00:15:17.886 --> 00:15:21.146]  And most of them you can take out of the trance very, very quickly.
[00:15:21.827 --> 00:15:24.047]  But we've got to get engaged even more now.
[00:15:24.367 --> 00:15:27.868]  The battle for the republic and the planet has just begun.
[00:15:28.248 --> 00:15:29.828]  And remember, none of this is our opinions.
[00:15:30.168 --> 00:15:31.509]  We've proven it completely.
[00:15:32.429 --> 00:15:33.189]  We're on target.
[00:15:33.569 --> 00:15:35.550]  We're the patriots that are defending America.
[00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.210]  We're the ones that have been proven right.
[00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.310]  We're the people that should have everyone's respect.
[00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.711]  That means all of you that have spread the word for decades.
[00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:54.057]  You are amazing what you've done, bucking the globalists when it was early on, when everybody was against you, going against the peer pressure, having the will, the historical understanding, and the guts to do what's right.
[00:15:54.297 --> 00:15:55.297]  I salute every one of you.
[00:15:55.798 --> 00:15:58.039]  Now here they are, back-to-back, Paul Watson's reports.
[00:16:08.089 --> 00:16:19.576]  In a sensational new development, TV host David Pakman says he was told by a high-level source that 15 electors in states that Trump won will refuse to vote for Donald Trump.
[00:16:19.716 --> 00:16:25.359]  This is something that, if true, is absolutely huge.
[00:16:25.959 --> 00:16:36.946]  And what my source told me is that there is a coalition of at least 15 electors, electoral voters, electors, Trump electors,
[00:16:37.657 --> 00:16:44.403]  Who have decided that they are not going to cast their electoral votes for Donald Trump on December 19th.
[00:16:44.623 --> 00:16:51.369]  Pacman went on to say that the electors are lobbying other members of the electoral college to not vote for Trump.
[00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:57.855]  The goal is to prevent Trump from getting the 270 electoral votes he requires to become president.
[00:16:58.015 --> 00:17:07.903]  If Trump loses 37 electoral votes it will put him under the 270 benchmark and throw America into a constitutional crisis.
[00:17:08.103 --> 00:17:18.772]  One elector in Texas has already resigned saying he will refuse to cast his electoral vote for Trump because he doesn't consider the president-elect biblically qualified to work in the White House.
[00:17:18.892 --> 00:17:23.876]  Jill Stein's recount could also throw the result in doubt in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
[00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:29.939]  Electors are also being bombarded with death threats and pressure to change their votes from Hillary supporters.
[00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:31.940]  This would be totally unprecedented.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.280]  And it's a long shot.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:38.522]  But it illustrates the left's desperation to do anything to sabotage Trump.
[00:17:38.662 --> 00:17:44.905]  Many of these electors will be breaking the law if they vote against the will of the people in their states.
[00:17:45.085 --> 00:17:47.866]  But in most cases, the punishment is a fine of just $1,000.
[00:17:48.687 --> 00:17:53.489]  And many of them will happily pay that to try and keep Trump out of office.
[00:17:53.689 --> 00:17:58.672]  As with the recount, it's virtually impossible to prevent Trump from taking the presidency.
[00:17:58.732 --> 00:18:04.475]  But this dirty tricks campaign will help create the narrative that Trump's presidency is illegitimate.
[00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:09.758]  A narrative already being framed by the constant assertion that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote.
[00:18:09.858 --> 00:18:15.582]  Derailing Trump's effort to implement significant policy changes within his first 100 days.
[00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:22.686]  Could 15 or more electors really be planning to defy the democratic will of the American people?
[00:18:23.226 --> 00:18:27.507]  Over 62 million of whom voted for Donald Trump.
[00:18:37.196 --> 00:18:39.518]  Jill Stein is a complete idiot.
[00:18:39.818 --> 00:18:43.222]  Her recount campaign has nothing to do with electoral integrity.
[00:18:43.482 --> 00:18:47.265]  It's a vicious assault on the very bedrock of democracy itself.
[00:18:47.506 --> 00:18:51.169]  This is not being done to benefit one candidate at the expense of the other.
[00:18:51.369 --> 00:18:51.810]  Really?
[00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.274]  Is that why all the recounts are taking place only in states that Trump
[00:18:56.875 --> 00:19:01.541]  Why not a single recount in a blue state that Hillary narrowly won, Jill?
[00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:05.265]  Trump won Pennsylvania by 78,000 votes.
[00:19:05.425 --> 00:19:09.130]  While Clinton won New Hampshire by less than 3,000 votes.
[00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.333]  She won Minnesota by less than 44,000 votes.
[00:19:11.373 --> 00:19:12.254]  And Nevada by around 26,000 votes.
[00:19:15.438 --> 00:19:19.282]  Smaller margins than Trump won Pennsylvania in every case.
[00:19:19.563 --> 00:19:22.126]  Why no recount in any of those states?
[00:19:22.306 --> 00:19:26.691]  Why a recount in Michigan, which doesn't even use electronic voting machines?
[00:19:26.911 --> 00:19:29.814]  None of their systems are even connected to the internet.
[00:19:30.675 --> 00:19:35.099]  Hillary Clinton's campaign admit they have no proof whatsoever of any fraud.
[00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:39.904]  But Jill's only doing this because she really cares about democracy.
[00:19:40.024 --> 00:19:50.153]  In fact, Jill cares so much about democracy that she spent the last few days fawning over someone who spent his entire life sending democracy activists to gulags.
[00:19:50.373 --> 00:19:57.119]  Fidel Castro was a symbol of the struggle for justice in the shadow of empire.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.501]  Presente.
[00:19:58.661 --> 00:20:06.168]  So you're calling for electoral integrity while praising a dictator who ruled for half a century without a proper election?
[00:20:06.388 --> 00:20:10.694]  Americans deserve fair, transparent elections.
[00:20:10.934 --> 00:20:19.244]  You're saying Americans deserve fair, transparent elections while genuflecting over someone who presided over a one-party state for 50 years?
[00:20:19.364 --> 00:20:20.526]  Give me a break.
[00:20:20.726 --> 00:20:24.391]  Hey Jill, Cuba's last election seemed a little bit fishy.
[00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:26.192]  How about a recount there?
[00:20:26.332 --> 00:20:32.054]  And while you're at it, why don't you audit California and find out how many illegal aliens voted for Hillary?
[00:20:32.114 --> 00:20:34.095]  That's not going to happen, is it, Jill?
[00:20:34.195 --> 00:20:37.556]  Because this has nothing to do with electoral integrity.
[00:20:37.656 --> 00:20:42.678]  It's about you remaining relevant, having failed to get barely 1% of the vote.
[00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:48.001]  It's about you fooling people into giving you a ton of money for something disguised as a recount.
[00:20:48.041 --> 00:20:53.743]  Which, when you read the fine print, actually says the surplus money is going straight into the Green Party's back pocket.
[00:20:54.403 --> 00:20:59.445]  It's about you trying to regain lefty street cred by doing Hillary's dirty work for her.
[00:20:59.565 --> 00:21:07.788]  It's about the left trying to delegitimize Trump's presidency before it even begins by stripping him of his Electoral College margin of victory.
[00:21:07.928 --> 00:21:10.649]  Forcing Congress to directly select Trump.
[00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:11.910]  So all the butthurt
[00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.951]  Hillary won the popular vote!
[00:21:14.171 --> 00:21:18.933]  Morons can go out and riot again, full of contrived righteous indignation.
[00:21:19.033 --> 00:21:20.934]  Unless they engage in brazen fraud.
[00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:31.178]  Trump is still going to be president, but given that the recounts probably won't even be done in time, they're going to use this to disrupt the Electoral College vote before December 19th.
[00:21:31.378 --> 00:21:41.262]  Oh, and isn't it just rich that the raised corpse of Hillary, only people who hate Democracy Challenge election results, Clinton, is now hovering in the background of all this.
[00:21:41.482 --> 00:21:45.605]  Maybe November Hillary should have listened to October Hillary.
[00:21:45.765 --> 00:21:52.450]  To say you won't respect the results of the election, that is a direct threat to our democracy.
[00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:57.354]  Look, some people are sore losers and, you know, we just, we just gotta keep going.
[00:21:57.554 --> 00:22:07.697]  The same hag who lectured us about being sore losers refused to even concede to Trump on election night until Obama basically forced her to.
[00:22:07.757 --> 00:22:13.619]  She also reneged on a deal with Trump to concede within 15 minutes of the Associated Press announcing the winner.
[00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:22.801]  Now George Soros, globalist despot who specializes in overthrowing democratically elected governments, has been connected to the recount campaign.
[00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:24.702]  Well imagine my shock.
[00:22:24.862 --> 00:22:25.162]  Listen.
[00:22:25.342 --> 00:22:31.427]  Don't think that just because Trump won the presidency, they're actually going to let him become president without a fight.
[00:22:31.547 --> 00:22:33.849]  The political elite don't play by the rules.
[00:22:34.089 --> 00:22:38.533]  The rioting, hateful, butthurt, intolerant left are their attack dogs.
[00:22:38.773 --> 00:22:43.737]  They're perfectly willing to trash democracy when the result doesn't go their way.
[00:22:43.857 --> 00:22:44.698]  Look at Brexit.
[00:22:44.918 --> 00:22:49.283]  Nearly six months later, they're still doing everything to sabotage it.
[00:22:49.343 --> 00:22:53.167]  Between now and January, we have a massive battle on our hands.
[00:22:53.367 --> 00:22:54.348]  Listen up, Jill!
[00:22:54.729 --> 00:22:57.212]  We know you have complete contempt for democracy.
[00:22:57.392 --> 00:22:59.995]  We know you're bought and paid for by Team Hillary.
[00:23:00.335 --> 00:23:02.357]  We know you're a lying piece of s***!
[00:23:03.098 --> 00:23:16.886]  Why not just admit the real reasons for all this and stop pretending it's about electoral integrity, while you simultaneously praise dictators who once imprisoned and killed those who actually fought for electoral integrity?
[00:23:17.006 --> 00:23:27.252]  Take your George Soros money, go back to being a political failure, and stop being used as a pawn to overturn the democratic will of the American people.
[00:23:34.974 --> 00:23:36.495]  All right, it's December 1st.
[00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:38.476]  I'm David Knight here live in the studio.
[00:23:38.516 --> 00:23:41.097]  We're going to be having Gerald Salenti join us in the next hour.
[00:23:41.137 --> 00:23:45.799]  He's going to be looking at, I'm sure, a lot of economic issues, post-election issues.
[00:23:45.839 --> 00:23:56.244]  Looking forward to seeing what Gerald has to say about the cabinet picks that we've seen, especially the Treasury Secretary that we had yesterday, Steve Mnuchin.
[00:23:57.065 --> 00:24:01.047]  There's been a lot of talk about Steve Mnuchin, and we're going to get to that first, but I want to follow up with what
[00:24:02.233 --> 00:24:06.755]  Paul Watson was just talking about the 15 electors saying they're going to refuse to vote for Trump.
[00:24:07.335 --> 00:24:11.276]  You know, most of this elector stuff and the talk that we've seen has been coming from Democrats.
[00:24:11.376 --> 00:24:12.116]  Isn't it interesting?
[00:24:12.236 --> 00:24:13.917]  And Colorado and other places like that.
[00:24:13.957 --> 00:24:17.698]  But I'm sure there's a strong never Trump strain in there.
[00:24:17.838 --> 00:24:21.880]  I think it may have to do with Trump picking Reince Priebus.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.321]  Perhaps he picked Priebus to shut that down.
[00:24:25.341 --> 00:24:28.502]  Remember the same thing was happening in the lead up to the RNC.
[00:24:28.522 --> 00:24:31.303]  They were saying, well, we had an election and
[00:24:32.143 --> 00:24:38.188]  You should have electors going to represent the particular candidate, but they're not.
[00:24:38.248 --> 00:24:42.371]  They're going to vote their own conscience and defy what the electors want.
[00:24:42.391 --> 00:24:44.573]  That was what the Never Trump people were pushing at the time.
[00:24:44.974 --> 00:24:49.577]  And actually, I think that was a probably a more dangerous time because
[00:24:50.518 --> 00:24:53.340]  If you won a state, you didn't get to pick those electors.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:25:00.504]  And so we saw Ted Cruz going in and getting people who supported him rather than people who supported Trump if Trump won the state.
[00:25:00.544 --> 00:25:01.845]  We saw that happening over and over again.
[00:25:02.345 --> 00:25:04.406]  It's a different deal when it comes to the Electoral College.
[00:25:04.446 --> 00:25:09.389]  In the Electoral College, you have a slate of electors that are picked by that party.
[00:25:09.789 --> 00:25:13.352]  So if you can keep that party in line, if you can have somebody like Reince Priebus
[00:25:14.412 --> 00:25:22.666]  Keep that party in line so that you've got people who are supporting the Republican rather than Hillary Clinton, then I think we're going to be in good shape.
[00:25:22.706 --> 00:25:26.011]  And I think, as we look at all of this talk about Jill Stein...
[00:25:27.011 --> 00:25:31.353]  We've got to remember that this lady doesn't understand economics.
[00:25:31.373 --> 00:25:32.134]  She's a socialist.
[00:25:32.174 --> 00:25:36.536]  She's praising Castro, as you just saw in the report from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:25:37.376 --> 00:25:38.877]  She doesn't appreciate democracy.
[00:25:38.937 --> 00:25:43.779]  She doesn't understand how the process works, just like these people who immediately took to the streets.
[00:25:43.839 --> 00:25:46.821]  They looked at a lot of these protesters who were arrested.
[00:25:47.081 --> 00:25:48.742]  Most of them were not even registered to vote.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:54.321]  Okay, that's the way they participate in the elections, is after the fact, to burn stuff down.
[00:25:55.141 --> 00:25:58.062]  But she doesn't even understand how the appeal process works.
[00:25:58.622 --> 00:26:01.442]  She missed the deadline in Pennsylvania by a full week.
[00:26:01.642 --> 00:26:13.165]  That means that those 20 votes would still be there for Donald Trump, and if that all holds, then even if she's able to stop these other two states from participating in the Electoral College, then he would still have
[00:26:14.178 --> 00:26:15.439]  Two hundred and eighty votes.
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.002]  So that's something that bears watching.
[00:26:18.102 --> 00:26:20.325]  I think that explains a lot of things that are going on there.
[00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:25.750]  And of course, it is a move to really come after the electoral college.
[00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.112]  We need to understand that as well.
[00:26:27.856 --> 00:26:29.397]  All these people who are pushing for this.
[00:26:29.417 --> 00:26:30.178]  It was kind of interesting.
[00:26:30.198 --> 00:26:32.760]  I was going to talk about this yesterday, but we didn't have time to talk about it.
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.003]  They've actually got a group that names themselves after Hamilton.
[00:26:37.043 --> 00:26:43.028]  The irony of it was that Hamilton was an elitist who didn't trust the people.
[00:26:43.528 --> 00:26:47.831]  He supported the Electoral College, and yet these people are saying, well, we want Hamilton electors.
[00:26:48.492 --> 00:26:50.073]  We want to have a direct democracy.
[00:26:50.093 --> 00:26:52.395]  And it's like, that's not what Hamilton supported.
[00:26:52.435 --> 00:26:53.536]  You don't understand history.
[00:26:53.596 --> 00:26:55.197]  You don't know what the guidelines are.
[00:26:55.217 --> 00:26:57.038]  You don't understand any of this stuff.
[00:26:57.839 --> 00:27:06.725]  But as I pointed out before, the Electoral College is a good thing because it is a firewall against the corruption and the concentration of power that we see in large states.
[00:27:07.405 --> 00:27:11.968]  And we have an article on Infowars.com from Alan West pointing out this very fact.
[00:27:11.988 --> 00:27:16.151]  He said, these numbers should shut up liberals about the Electoral College once and for all.
[00:27:16.171 --> 00:27:17.232]  But he makes a point in it.
[00:27:17.272 --> 00:27:22.756]  He says, our founders in their infinite wisdom created the Electoral College to ensure the states
[00:27:23.516 --> 00:27:24.537]  We're fairly represented.
[00:27:24.897 --> 00:27:28.959]  Why should one or two densely populated areas speak for the whole of the nation?
[00:27:29.419 --> 00:27:36.343]  And again, we have to understand, they viewed, and they rightfully so, the federal government was a creation of the states.
[00:27:37.223 --> 00:27:42.066]  It's not just we the people that created the federal government, but the states created the federal government as well.
[00:27:42.086 --> 00:27:51.871]  And they were so concerned about the concentration and consolidation of power in the federal government that we have now seen become a reality in our lifetimes, that to try to avoid that,
[00:27:52.651 --> 00:27:59.314]  They separated power not only within the federal government, but also between the people and the states.
[00:27:59.434 --> 00:28:05.657]  They gave the state governments the power to directly appoint senators and other things, which we have now repealed.
[00:28:05.697 --> 00:28:08.819]  And that's why we have the kind of concentration that we have in the states.
[00:28:08.939 --> 00:28:20.444]  But still, it remains as a firewall to having New York and Chicago and L.A., New York City, those three cities essentially pick the presidency.
[00:28:20.484 --> 00:28:23.866]  We can see what's happening even in North Carolina where there really is legitimate
[00:28:24.306 --> 00:28:25.126]  We're good to go.
[00:28:54.482 --> 00:28:56.077]  When we're looking at this recount,
[00:28:58.247 --> 00:29:06.793]  Yesterday, somebody had someone from, I think it was Wisconsin, might have been Michigan, but I think it was with Wisconsin, fighting with Jill Stein.
[00:29:06.814 --> 00:29:11.997]  They said, this is highly unusual for a candidate who got less than 1% to demand a recount.
[00:29:12.037 --> 00:29:13.558]  She has absolutely no chance of winning.
[00:29:13.598 --> 00:29:15.040]  And of course, it's not about that.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:22.085]  We have a report from Kit Daniels talking about how Hillary is holding up with this and also kind of touches on the motivations behind this.
[00:29:22.125 --> 00:29:24.907]  Not only the self-serving motivations of Jill Stein,
[00:29:25.507 --> 00:29:40.503]  But also the motivations of the progressives of Barack Obama, initially calling on Hillary Clinton and saying, concede, but now encouraging her to participate in the process because he thinks that progressives are stunned and helpless and they've got to rise out of their stupor.
[00:29:41.183 --> 00:29:42.765]  And so he thinks this is going to be a morale builder.
[00:29:43.025 --> 00:29:45.828]  Stay with us, we'll talk about that and other issues when we come back.
[00:29:45.948 --> 00:29:46.449]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.471 --> 00:29:53.493]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.414 --> 00:29:57.216]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.059 --> 00:30:02.880]  Breaking news!
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.142]  California wants to succeed after a Donald Trump victory.
[00:30:06.362 --> 00:30:08.343]  Article up by the Sacramento Bee.
[00:30:08.644 --> 00:30:09.284]  Want to get away?
[00:30:09.464 --> 00:30:13.467]  Cal exits succession plan possible, but faces huge hurdles.
[00:30:13.807 --> 00:30:15.528]  Well, guess what, California?
[00:30:15.628 --> 00:30:17.730]  The rest of America's not your hurdle.
[00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:18.911]  Because we're all for it!
[00:30:19.171 --> 00:30:19.731]  Please!
[00:30:19.991 --> 00:30:20.752]  Leave now!
[00:30:21.012 --> 00:30:37.763]  Let's take all the good people out of there, because there's some good ones down there, and then we'll just dump the rest of Portland, and New York, and Miami, and Austin, and all the liberal hellholes, and we'll just dump them all in California, and we'll even help break away the land and push you guys out in the ocean.
[00:30:38.084 --> 00:30:39.064]  That'd be even better.
[00:30:39.264 --> 00:30:41.366]  You don't even have to have borders, because guess what?
[00:30:41.786 --> 00:30:45.829]  Nobody's gonna want to go there, because that sounds like hell on earth.
[00:30:46.169 --> 00:30:53.520]  Now facing Donald Trump's imminent entrance to the Oval Office, the once outlandish idea of succession doesn't seem so crazy anymore to some Californians.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.302]  Doesn't sound crazy to me either.
[00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:56.264]  See you later!
[00:30:56.504 --> 00:30:58.547]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com
[00:31:01.741 --> 00:31:06.524]  If you ever wanted to keep your lights on, maybe run emergency appliances when the power goes out.
[00:31:06.765 --> 00:31:09.006]  This could be one of the most important messages you'll ever hear.
[00:31:09.286 --> 00:31:09.827]  Here's why.
[00:31:10.127 --> 00:31:13.169]  There's a new solar generator out that pretty much everyone can afford.
[00:31:13.529 --> 00:31:19.814]  It provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[00:31:20.034 --> 00:31:20.815]  But here's the key.
[00:31:21.195 --> 00:31:23.957]  It's so small you can put it in your pocket or glove compartment.
[00:31:24.177 --> 00:31:25.198]  Now this is really cool.
[00:31:25.398 --> 00:31:28.500]  Probably one of the best off-the-grid products I've seen in a while.
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.362]  And you've got to watch some of the crazy videos on this website.
[00:31:31.482 --> 00:31:32.503]  You won't believe your eyes.
[00:31:32.983 --> 00:31:33.764]  A true innovation.
[00:31:33.984 --> 00:31:35.565]  I have never seen anything like this.
[00:31:35.985 --> 00:31:37.746]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[00:31:37.866 --> 00:31:40.028]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.

[00:33:08.363 --> 00:33:23.394]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:33:23.474 --> 00:33:26.096]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:39.338 --> 00:33:40.699]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:44.661]  I'm David Knight, your host and studio, and Gerald Cilenti is going to be joining us in the next hour.
[00:33:44.741 --> 00:33:46.522]  He's going to talk about post-election issues.
[00:33:46.542 --> 00:33:50.845]  He's going to talk about the economy, the global effects of the Trump presidency, trade.
[00:33:51.205 --> 00:33:57.668]  He's also going to talk about some of his top ten, not top ten, but his top trends for 2017.
[00:33:57.889 --> 00:34:00.810]  And of course, Gerald Cilenti's publication is Trends Journal.
[00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:05.193]  So we want to see what Gerald sees ahead for 2017.
[00:34:05.893 --> 00:34:07.294]  We've seen a lot of optimism
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.745]  After the election, I want to talk about the pushback on free speech.
[00:34:12.825 --> 00:34:21.455]  I want to talk about the reaction that Hillary Clinton is having, and I want to talk about two different aspects of the reaction to free speech.
[00:34:21.736 --> 00:34:24.399]  Let me finish with what I was talking about just before we went to the break.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:34.191]  Which is this report from Kit Daniels, a report from an insider saying that drunk Hillary is demanding a recount to, quote, lift her spirits.
[00:34:34.692 --> 00:34:37.395]  Maybe she's going from first lady to bag lady.
[00:34:37.856 --> 00:34:40.940]  You know, wallowing in her self-pity, alcohol the gutter, Beth.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.382]  But with mountains of cash to comfort her.
[00:34:45.103 --> 00:35:00.095]  They say, this is a Clinton insider, said she's weepy, she looks 10 years older, she's very whiny, she's been drinking wine pretty heavily, much more than usual, she mopes around all day, swimming in a sea of recriminations and complaining that her campaign managers were incompetent.
[00:35:00.375 --> 00:35:01.956]  Bill and Chelsea didn't work hard enough.
[00:35:02.337 --> 00:35:04.679]  FBI Director Comey was in league with Trump.
[00:35:05.339 --> 00:35:06.640]  It's not her fault, see.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.442]  It's all these other people.
[00:35:08.842 --> 00:35:13.626]  It's this vast right-wing and now a vast left-wing conspiracy against her as well.
[00:35:13.926 --> 00:35:17.508]  Everybody has conspired to deny her her lifelong ambitions.
[00:35:17.529 --> 00:35:18.389]  I'm so sorry, Hillary.
[00:35:18.749 --> 00:35:22.692]  You know, I've said many times I never thought that we would get Hillary in jail.
[00:35:23.672 --> 00:35:28.854]  But I thought we could, if we defeated her, then it would be a punishment worse than jail.
[00:35:29.155 --> 00:35:30.375]  And maybe that's happening.
[00:35:30.395 --> 00:35:33.197]  I just can't contain, I'm sorry.
[00:35:34.077 --> 00:35:45.022]  Anyway, additionally, they say President Obama, who pressured Clinton to concede to Trump on election night, also encouraged her to jump on board Jill Stein's recount effort to make the globalists look less defeated, said the source.
[00:35:45.482 --> 00:35:50.685]  They said the president felt the progressives were acting stunned and helpless and had to rise out of their stupor.
[00:35:51.425 --> 00:35:58.327]  Contesting the results of the election was the best and fastest way to stir the morale and the fighting spirit of a demoralized party.
[00:35:59.307 --> 00:36:01.048]  He is a community organizer.
[00:36:01.508 --> 00:36:04.889]  He works with all these people that are surrounded by George Soros folks.
[00:36:05.569 --> 00:36:10.971]  And this whole thing is an effort to try to delegitimize the election, seriously.
[00:36:11.031 --> 00:36:11.991]  This is the tactic.
[00:36:12.031 --> 00:36:13.591]  We've pointed this out from the very beginning.
[00:36:13.852 --> 00:36:18.053]  As soon as they started the riots, like, oh, this looks like a color revolution from George Soros.
[00:36:18.073 --> 00:36:18.433]  What do they do?
[00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:30.824]  They always paint the victor as corrupt, as racist, as, well, not racist, but authoritarian, because in other parts of the world, they don't really have that as not the central leverage.
[00:36:30.904 --> 00:36:32.585]  It's typically a class struggle.
[00:36:32.965 --> 00:36:35.626]  In America, they've made it a race struggle.
[00:36:35.686 --> 00:36:39.107]  That was the brainchild of Bill Ayers and his
[00:36:40.388 --> 00:36:50.259]  His people, the radicals from the 60s, they realized that they weren't going to be able to organize the communists left along the same lines that they would in Europe, so they chose to try to divide people by skin color.
[00:36:51.019 --> 00:36:53.062]  And that's worked pretty well, their white skin privilege.
[00:36:55.086 --> 00:36:57.646]  So we know that that's the way they've worked in other countries.
[00:36:57.847 --> 00:36:59.847]  We know that they try to delegitimize the election.
[00:36:59.867 --> 00:37:04.568]  They tried to personally attack and demonize the person who won.
[00:37:04.748 --> 00:37:12.129]  And then they get these social justice warriors, college students to get violent and to stage a revolution.
[00:37:12.709 --> 00:37:14.069]  And so that's what they're trying to do.
[00:37:14.189 --> 00:37:16.670]  I don't think they're going to succeed, but that's the tactic on it.
[00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:22.211]  Also, before I get to this other news, we see that we've got
[00:37:23.356 --> 00:37:29.862]  The usual suspects, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, out working hard on 9-11.
[00:37:30.382 --> 00:37:34.006]  Working not for the American people, but for their Saudi masters.
[00:37:34.386 --> 00:37:38.510]  Okay, The Hill reports, GOP senators want to amend the Saudi 9-11 bill.
[00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:44.075]  So it wasn't enough that they would delay compensation to the victims of 9-11 for 15 years.
[00:37:44.175 --> 00:37:45.757]  Now they, that passed.
[00:37:46.317 --> 00:37:49.840]  Because that was not something they were going to be able to sell politically.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:56.365]  And especially after Donald Trump pushed for the missing 28 pages out of the report.
[00:37:56.445 --> 00:38:02.449]  If they want to blame 9-11 on the Saudis, then let's have them compensate us for it, okay?
[00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:11.977]  But now we've got McCain and Graham rolling out an amendment to a law that allows the families of 9-11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia so they can protect Saudi Arabia.
[00:38:12.773 --> 00:38:13.433]  from the victims.
[00:38:14.254 --> 00:38:16.035]  They say that Saudi Arabia did this, but say no.
[00:38:16.215 --> 00:38:17.256]  And here's the way they're going to do it.
[00:38:17.276 --> 00:38:30.383]  They want to change the law, which is JASTA, it's the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which sailed through Congress so that lawsuits can only be brought against foreign governments that quote unquote knowingly support terrorism.
[00:38:30.543 --> 00:38:32.945]  See, it's kind of like Hillary and Comey.
[00:38:33.245 --> 00:38:34.346]  Hillary said, oh, she's got
[00:38:35.259 --> 00:38:40.062]  All of these felony violations of national security, but she didn't do it knowingly.
[00:38:40.622 --> 00:38:42.083]  She doesn't know what she's doing.
[00:38:42.843 --> 00:38:49.747]  And, you know, when they deliberately erased and electronically shredded the disks, she didn't do that knowingly.
[00:38:50.348 --> 00:38:53.289]  There's no intent to evade the law or to break the law.
[00:38:53.489 --> 00:38:56.271]  Just stuff just happens, you know, for the rich and powerful at the very top.
[00:38:58.254 --> 00:39:03.338]  They want to tell us on the one hand that the Saudis did it, but then on the other hand that they shouldn't be held responsible.
[00:39:03.418 --> 00:39:09.442]  And of course the 9-11 families and Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism are not having any part of that.
[00:39:09.883 --> 00:39:11.243]  They quickly slammed that.
[00:39:11.944 --> 00:39:15.427]  Now at the same time, we see that there's a lot of talk.
[00:39:15.667 --> 00:39:17.388]  Bloomberg is pushing this idea.
[00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:17.948]  Listen to this.
[00:39:17.968 --> 00:39:22.272]  They're expanding this narrative about how Russia
[00:39:23.444 --> 00:39:25.886]  Put out this information about Hillary Clinton.
[00:39:25.926 --> 00:39:27.367]  Remember the Red Scare?
[00:39:27.387 --> 00:39:29.388]  You know, WikiLeaks was an agent of Russia.
[00:39:29.468 --> 00:39:44.798]  Well now, the conspiracy theory widens because if you, through social media, put out some of the information that was exposed about Hillary Clinton and John Podesta, now you are part of the vast right-wing conspiracy.
[00:39:45.038 --> 00:39:47.600]  Not only right-wing, but the Red Wing, I guess we should call it.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:48.921]  The Red Scare conspiracy.
[00:39:50.009 --> 00:39:53.392]  And this article from Bloomberg says Russia weaponized social media.
[00:39:53.432 --> 00:39:53.732]  See that?
[00:39:54.273 --> 00:39:56.254]  Weaponized social media.
[00:39:56.875 --> 00:39:58.616]  This is a company called FireEye.
[00:39:58.636 --> 00:40:03.621]  I wonder if their corporate logo is Sauron from the Lord of the Rings.
[00:40:04.461 --> 00:40:06.463]  That would be appropriate, wouldn't it?
[00:40:06.583 --> 00:40:11.027]  Russia's government, they said, didn't just hack and leak the documents from U.S.
[00:40:11.047 --> 00:40:12.728]  political groups during the presidential campaign.
[00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:15.371]  It used social media as a weapon.
[00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:17.212]  Here's the fake news thing coming in as well, right?
[00:40:17.232 --> 00:40:17.713]  So they enlarge this.
[00:40:38.168 --> 00:40:43.252]  They go on to say they have to do something about the spread of fake news.
[00:40:43.973 --> 00:40:49.077]  And it has enlisted demands from Jill Stein to look at the election.
[00:40:49.357 --> 00:40:49.577]  Why?
[00:40:49.637 --> 00:40:50.898]  Because there's fake news, they say.
[00:40:50.938 --> 00:40:54.161]  See, Jill Stein is not about any kind of election reform.
[00:40:55.062 --> 00:40:57.624]  She could have talked about voter machine fraud.
[00:40:58.601 --> 00:41:06.345]  But when we talked about it, when we talked about voter fraud, when we talked about machine fraud, we were labeled as conspiracy theorists.
[00:41:07.065 --> 00:41:10.146]  But now, they think they can use it to stop Donald Trump.
[00:41:10.286 --> 00:41:13.368]  So, just like globalism was originally a conspiracy theory,
[00:41:14.088 --> 00:41:23.673]  And then they said, oh, that doesn't exist, that's just in the mind of some people in InfoWars, or whatever, this whole New World Order and globalism, that's just a conspiracy theory.
[00:41:23.693 --> 00:41:25.974]  Then they said, no, no, no, globalism is a good thing.
[00:41:26.335 --> 00:41:32.478]  You need to understand it's a good thing, even though it may have destroyed your life, it may have destroyed the middle class in America, no, it's a good thing.
[00:41:32.498 --> 00:41:36.480]  Then when they lost the election, they came back to calling it a conspiracy theory again.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:41.683]  I mean, this is like 1984, you know, first these people are your enemies, now they're your friends, now they're your enemies.
[00:41:42.603 --> 00:41:43.664]  They think we don't understand.
[00:41:43.684 --> 00:41:56.555]  And so, after telling us this lie about all these leaks coming from Russia, and of course we had people like William Benny, people like Steve Pucinich, they were saying, it's not coming from Russia.
[00:41:57.276 --> 00:42:01.179]  These are patriots in the United States who are sick and tired of this corrupt regime.
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:06.824]  They're sick and tired of seeing national security that they really think ought to be protected
[00:42:07.728 --> 00:42:21.192]  Being just thrown in the trash by Hillary Clinton and they don't want to see this kind of cronyism that we have seen from and corruption that we've seen from Hillary Clinton, kind of Rico corruption, the kind of mafia corruption that we've seen with the Clinton Foundation.
[00:42:22.792 --> 00:42:28.774]  You know, you want to believe that WikiLeaks and InfoWars and all of social media
[00:42:29.694 --> 00:42:30.774]  Is it a Russian conspiracy?
[00:42:31.055 --> 00:42:32.315]  How ridiculous is this getting?
[00:42:32.335 --> 00:42:33.996]  But it just keeps metastasizing.
[00:42:34.356 --> 00:42:42.079]  And it's not limited to Bloomberg that's selling this, or the Washington Post that's selling this, or FireEye that is selling this.
[00:42:42.479 --> 00:42:44.880]  This is now being enacted into law.
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:52.805]  RT points out that the House has passed an intelligence bill aimed at thwarting Russia's influence over people in governments.
[00:42:52.845 --> 00:42:54.086]  Understand where this is coming from.
[00:42:54.346 --> 00:43:09.716]  They're using FireEye to sell this idea that now it's not only just the fact that we can see the corruption in these emails, the exchange of money for favors, the backroom deals that created ISIS.
[00:43:09.756 --> 00:43:10.196]  No, no, no.
[00:43:10.376 --> 00:43:11.237]  Don't look at that stuff.
[00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:16.674]  And if you look at that stuff, if you pass that around, you are part of the Russian conspiracy.
[00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:17.634]  We've got to do something about it.
[00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:20.617]  The House of Representatives has now passed an intelligence bill.
[00:43:20.677 --> 00:43:21.678]  It's got to go before the Senate.
[00:43:22.038 --> 00:43:23.259]  What are the chances it'll win there?
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.340]  Pretty good.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:29.764]  Because you've got both the Republicans and the Democrats who want a deeper security state.
[00:43:30.245 --> 00:43:32.226]  This is a 93-page bill passed by the House.
[00:43:32.246 --> 00:43:32.787]  390 to 30.
[00:43:32.827 --> 00:43:33.307]  It was done yesterday.
[00:43:36.934 --> 00:43:48.617]  It calls for setting up a new inter-agency panel to suppress Russia's alleged attempt to, quote, exert covert influence over peoples and governments, reports the Washington Post.
[00:43:49.097 --> 00:44:00.920]  So you understand that all this nonsense that began with the leaks of the DNC about this all being a Russian conspiracy, this is now making its way into law, bipartisan law.
[00:44:01.926 --> 00:44:07.532]  They say that they're going to counter active measures by Russia to exert covert influence.
[00:44:07.552 --> 00:44:08.173]  What are they going to do?
[00:44:08.233 --> 00:44:14.659]  Are they going to use Voice of America to counter Russian propaganda, as they say, inside the United States?
[00:44:14.699 --> 00:44:22.748]  Because it was a couple of years ago that they said we're going to remove the restrictions of this propaganda media outlet so that they can broadcast into America.
[00:44:22.788 --> 00:44:24.490]  So they've already been laying the groundwork for that.
[00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:36.721]  They said this is going to include exposing falsehoods, agents of influence, corruption, human rights abuses, terrorism and assassinations carried out by the security services or political elites of the Russian Federation or their proxies.
[00:44:36.741 --> 00:44:39.023]  So now they're going to be countering this.
[00:44:39.564 --> 00:44:46.451]  They are going to be coming after false news by the Congress itself.
[00:44:47.458 --> 00:44:49.040]  Yeah, it is weaponized, alright.
[00:44:49.761 --> 00:44:54.227]  But it's not coming from the people who share the stuff on social media.
[00:44:54.247 --> 00:44:55.429]  It's not coming from WikiLeaks.
[00:44:55.449 --> 00:44:58.713]  They're simply telling people the truth about our corrupt government.
[00:44:59.454 --> 00:45:00.536]  That's what they don't want to see.
[00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:13.681]  And when they go in and say part of this is going to be updating whistleblower protections in the intelligence community and requiring declassification review of intelligence reports on detainees transferred out of Gitmo by Obama and George Bush.
[00:45:13.721 --> 00:45:25.203]  Well, you know, if they want to make it easier for whistleblowers, maybe you should listen to some of the whistleblowers, like William Binney, who said this isn't Russia that is pushing this.
[00:45:26.667 --> 00:45:29.790]  OK, this is this is really dangerous, folks.
[00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.774]  This is getting to a larger, much larger scope.
[00:45:32.854 --> 00:45:35.036]  And take a look at what happened to Breitbart yesterday.
[00:45:35.476 --> 00:45:37.879]  We have this up on Infowars.com as well.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.081]  First, we had Breitbart.
[00:45:40.902 --> 00:45:43.324]  Being boycotted by Kellogg's.
[00:45:44.084 --> 00:45:51.369]  Kellogg's came out and said, well, we're going to end our relationship with Breitbart because we don't like the views expressed.
[00:45:51.629 --> 00:45:54.511]  They don't align with Kellogg's company values.
[00:45:55.171 --> 00:45:57.133]  So they pulled their advertising.
[00:45:58.474 --> 00:46:01.616]  Well, what are Kellogg's values?
[00:46:02.728 --> 00:46:11.355]  Breitbart came back out and did a report talking about how Amnesty International has been blasting Kellogg's for child labor.
[00:46:11.535 --> 00:46:12.797]  There's Kellogg's values.
[00:46:14.958 --> 00:46:25.587]  Breitbart evidently doesn't support child labor in third world countries and so Kellogg's is going to pull out their advertising because they don't support their values.
[00:46:27.249 --> 00:46:30.732]  Amnesty International has been investigating a company called Wilmar.
[00:46:31.817 --> 00:46:40.235]  They are the world's largest processor and merchandiser of palm oil, and they control 43% of the global palm oil trade.
[00:46:41.038 --> 00:46:45.159]  Wilmar provides palm oil to Kellogg's and other producers of consumer electronics.
[00:46:45.179 --> 00:46:57.782]  Amnesty International said there's serious human rights abuses on the plantations of Wilmar and its suppliers, including forced labor, child labor, gender discrimination, as well as exploitative and dangerous working practices.
[00:46:57.842 --> 00:47:03.124]  They say, in terms of child labor, Amnesty says some children start working at the age of eight and on.
[00:47:03.804 --> 00:47:05.885]  And all were below 15 years of age.
[00:47:06.105 --> 00:47:07.525]  Some children have dropped out of school.
[00:47:07.725 --> 00:47:08.725]  They work for most of the day.
[00:47:09.086 --> 00:47:12.566]  Children are carrying heavy loads as they have to carry sacks of loose fruit.
[00:47:13.067 --> 00:47:20.269]  And some transport wheelbarrows full of heavy palm fruit bunches over uneven terrain and narrow bridges.
[00:47:21.049 --> 00:47:23.589]  So, this is the war that's going back and forth.
[00:47:23.629 --> 00:47:29.191]  And in response to that article, Breitbart then launched a counter-boycott to Kellogg's.
[00:47:29.989 --> 00:47:31.650]  And they put it up as a Twitter hashtag.
[00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:33.392]  Hashtag Dump Kellogg's.
[00:47:34.172 --> 00:47:40.417]  And that went to number one on Twitter because people are sick and tired of this.
[00:47:40.437 --> 00:47:41.578]  We understand what's behind this.
[00:47:41.598 --> 00:47:44.200]  We understand what FireEye is doing.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.222]  We understand what the House is doing.
[00:47:46.622 --> 00:47:52.827]  Now pushing this fake news narrative and trying to shut down outlets like Breitbart.
[00:47:53.487 --> 00:47:56.011]  For publishing stories that they don't agree with.
[00:47:56.391 --> 00:48:02.159]  Censoring people on social media saying that social media is now weaponized by the Russian government.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:09.990]  And then our House and soon to be Senate saying we're going to have government ways to push back.
[00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:32.886]  Against social media is really what they're saying folks so understand what this is about and understand This is one of the reasons why we fund the operation the way we do here at InfoWars for two reasons Number one you don't need to be eating Cereal that is loaded with sugar and palm oil so we said let's give people some healthy stuff For their to take care of themselves take care of their families
[00:48:33.885 --> 00:48:40.870]  The other part of it is so that we don't become vulnerable to these kinds of boycotts that are inevitable with big corporations.
[00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:51.718]  This is why the big news corporations tiptoe around these stories about Big Pharma and other issues is because they don't want to lose their corporate sponsorship.
[00:48:52.298 --> 00:48:54.279]  And so they're very susceptible to this type of thing.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.641]  Breitbart is not taking this lying down.
[00:48:56.661 --> 00:48:58.482]  They're going out with a counter boycott.
[00:48:58.963 --> 00:49:00.624]  Hopefully that will be successful.
[00:49:01.704 --> 00:49:09.167]  But one of the things that we do, as I said, is we support our operation by offering you directly fine quality products that are going to help your health.
[00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:11.208]  One of the things that we offer is DNA Force.
[00:49:11.968 --> 00:49:14.629]  DNA Force is a very unique product.
[00:49:15.189 --> 00:49:16.830]  It has BioPQQ.
[00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:20.551]  It is a compound that's backed by over 175 clinical studies.
[00:49:20.671 --> 00:49:21.772]  It's very hard to secure.
[00:49:21.812 --> 00:49:23.292]  It's very expensive to produce.
[00:49:24.053 --> 00:49:24.433]  And it is
[00:49:25.453 --> 00:49:33.036]  Synergistically mixed with other ingredients, other potent antioxidants like vitamin C that you can get a lot of sources, but we get the best quality sources.
[00:49:33.096 --> 00:49:41.938]  We combine them with unique things like BioPQQ and that is something that you can support our operation with and you can support your health with.
[00:49:42.199 --> 00:49:49.241]  Or other things like BrainForce, another very unique thing that we offer here at InfoWars that is my favorite supplement because I can
[00:49:49.881 --> 00:49:50.844]  Definitely feel that.
[00:49:50.864 --> 00:49:56.841]  You know, when you do something that helps your immune system, or you do something that helps your DNA, you're not going to feel that.
[00:49:57.831 --> 00:50:06.058]  You may look at yourself over a long period of time, and when I take these supplements, I see that I'm not getting sick like others in my family that would take them.
[00:50:06.158 --> 00:50:16.207]  Typically, we're getting all of our kids to take this stuff now because we've just been taking it, my wife and I, a lot of these supplements that are there just to supplement your health.
[00:50:16.227 --> 00:50:16.827]  We've been taking that.
[00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:19.710]  We find that we're not getting as sick as frequently as the kids do.
[00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:22.492]  So, it's like, okay, we need to extend this to everybody.
[00:50:23.567 --> 00:50:30.073]  Not just to us, but when I take something like Brain Force, I can immediately feel how that focuses my mind.
[00:50:30.233 --> 00:50:32.515]  I know that it has a direct effect.
[00:50:32.575 --> 00:50:40.261]  So we offer unique products that gives us an independence from this kind of boycotting from corporate sponsors.
[00:50:40.361 --> 00:50:42.303]  And you're going to see this happening in multiple ways.
[00:50:42.603 --> 00:50:50.249]  They're pulling out all the stops, the fake news narrative, the censorship on social media, calling social media weaponized, and now
[00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:54.471]  Boycotting from financial sponsors trying to put people out of business.
[00:50:54.491 --> 00:50:54.851]  Stay with us.
[00:50:54.911 --> 00:50:55.431]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.714 --> 00:51:02.735]  We need to wake people up.
[00:51:03.035 --> 00:51:07.897]  There's still people who've never heard of your show or the alternative media that's out there.
[00:51:08.137 --> 00:51:17.042]  We need to wake up our friends, our neighbors, our relatives, our co-workers, our fellow church congregants and get them fully informed and fully engaged.
[00:51:18.163 --> 00:51:20.284]  So it's important that you be well prepared.
[00:51:20.325 --> 00:51:21.365]  You need a deep larder.
[00:51:21.866 --> 00:51:24.707]  You need to have those beans, bullets and band-aids squared away.
[00:51:25.948 --> 00:51:35.395]  I've got to tell you, Alex, I have had a number of consulting clients over the last few months who are telling me that they're preparing to relocate.
[00:51:36.554 --> 00:51:53.167]  This winter, in the dead of winter, they're planning to relocate to places like the American Redoubt, to places like the Cumberland Plateau in eastern Tennessee, to places like the West Texas Hill Country, and to places like the Four Corners region.
[00:51:53.968 --> 00:52:03.035]  Even on a modest budget, someone can get squared away with food storage, with water filtration, first aid, with nutraceuticals, the whole works.
[00:52:03.755 --> 00:52:12.099]  On a pretty modest budget, the window of opportunity that we have for strategic relocation is likely to close sometime in the next year.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:20.724]  Because once the system is collapsed, it simply won't be safe to be moving bag and baggage from place to place.
[00:52:21.924 --> 00:52:25.586]  You'll be lucky if you just get out of Dodge with one carload at that point.
[00:52:25.826 --> 00:52:29.148]  Our opportunity exists to relocate
[00:52:30.583 --> 00:52:34.704]  Now, but it may not exist in another six months or 12 months.
[00:52:34.724 --> 00:52:39.725]  It could be reduced to third world living conditions in that period of time.
[00:52:39.805 --> 00:52:48.667]  If they crash the system, they crash the dollar through a credit collapse, then it could be something as simple as raising interest rates by two or three percent.
[00:52:49.007 --> 00:52:52.108]  People should be very selective about
[00:52:53.068 --> 00:52:56.150]  When and where they do their fighting.
[00:52:56.650 --> 00:53:03.594]  People need to, if they're going to be in the public sphere, you need to do so in a way where you can maintain your privacy.
[00:53:03.634 --> 00:53:04.995]  That means letters to the editor.
[00:53:06.215 --> 00:53:09.277]  That means broadside campaigns.
[00:53:10.177 --> 00:53:12.179]  That means micro-broadcasting.
[00:53:12.199 --> 00:53:15.300]  There's all kinds of different things that people can do.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:21.904]  We still have a citizenry that's fairly intelligent, fairly healthy.
[00:53:23.163 --> 00:53:25.505]  Compared to third world standards, we're incredibly healthy.
[00:53:26.585 --> 00:53:32.289]  And we have a citizenry with the means.
[00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:35.771]  We actually have one of the wealthiest societies on the planet.
[00:53:36.452 --> 00:53:39.293]  We have a citizenry with the means to make a difference.
[00:53:39.714 --> 00:53:41.255]  Because we're not starving to death.
[00:53:41.895 --> 00:53:50.401]  If you look at most of the third world despotism that goes on, it's only successful because your average citizen is
[00:53:51.321 --> 00:53:54.986]  Spending 99% of their time just worried about their survival.
[00:53:55.006 --> 00:53:57.710]  Horses of freedom and liberty are on the ride.
[00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:01.274]  The powers that be should be quaking in their boots at this point.
[00:54:13.163 --> 00:54:14.384]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:14.425 --> 00:54:14.965]  I'm David Knight.
[00:54:14.985 --> 00:54:16.767]  We're going to be talking to Gerald Cilenti.
[00:54:16.827 --> 00:54:27.760]  Actually, he's going to be hosting the next hour coming up, talking about what's ahead in terms of not just the election and the economy and the news that we've seen this last year, but also
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:34.603]  Talking about what Gerald Salenti sees as the top trends for 2017, because that's what Gerald Salenti focuses on.
[00:54:34.643 --> 00:54:39.405]  His trends journal is always looking ahead to see what the next trends are.
[00:54:39.445 --> 00:54:42.186]  So I'm eager to see what he thinks is ahead for 2017.
[00:54:42.406 --> 00:54:49.650]  You know, as we look at what's happening with this carrier deal, I think it's interesting to see the narrative develop.
[00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:53.832]  It is a huge win for a thousand people.
[00:54:54.352 --> 00:54:56.593]  It is a huge win for Donald Trump.
[00:54:57.742 --> 00:54:59.465]  And so they can't really deny it.
[00:54:59.505 --> 00:55:02.610]  Instead what they say are things like this, don't read too much into this carrier win.
[00:55:03.376 --> 00:55:09.199]  That's Wired Magazine, which now has become his left wing as Politico, The Huffington Post, Washington Post.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.221]  Wired Magazine says, hey, don't read too much into this Carrier win.
[00:55:13.241 --> 00:55:14.242]  Okay, yeah, it's a win.
[00:55:14.422 --> 00:55:30.991]  It's a win for Donald Trump, and he's still 50 days away from becoming president, but he's already doing things I've never seen a president do before in my life, and that is picking up the phone to actually save American jobs, doing things that actually fulfill his campaign promises, and he's not even president yet.
[00:55:32.031 --> 00:55:41.035]  And I want to go back and play a clip from Barack Obama mocking Donald Trump, saying he's not going to be able to save your jobs.
[00:55:41.055 --> 00:55:43.656]  He wouldn't even refer to him by name.
[00:55:43.696 --> 00:55:47.097]  He'll say a guy, and I'm not going to mention his name because I don't want to give him any publicity here.
[00:55:47.137 --> 00:55:47.717]  Here's that clip.
[00:55:49.718 --> 00:55:59.582]  But for those folks who've lost their job right now because a plant went down to Mexico, you know, that isn't going to make you feel better.
[00:56:00.327 --> 00:56:12.814]  And so what we have to do is to make sure that folks are trained for the jobs that are coming in now, because some of those jobs of the past are just not going to come back.
[00:56:13.374 --> 00:56:16.235]  Yeah, because you're going to put entire industries in bankruptcy.
[00:56:17.816 --> 00:56:24.059]  Like the person you just mentioned, who I'm not going to advertise for, that he's going to bring all these jobs back.
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.361]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that?
[00:56:26.401 --> 00:56:27.001]  What are you going to do?
[00:56:29.756 --> 00:56:30.676]  There's no answer to it.
[00:56:31.377 --> 00:56:34.539]  He just says, well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.901]  How exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[00:56:38.962 --> 00:56:40.343]  What magic wand do you have?
[00:56:41.584 --> 00:56:44.846]  And usually the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.
[00:56:47.167 --> 00:56:48.608]  Yeah, he does have a magic wand.
[00:56:48.968 --> 00:56:51.048]  And he doesn't even have your power base, Barack.
[00:56:51.068 --> 00:56:55.729]  You're still president, but you wouldn't do anything to try to save these carrier jobs, would you?
[00:56:56.350 --> 00:57:07.172]  So here's a guy, and he's 50 days away from taking the office that you have used to say you're going to bankrupt the coal industry, you're going to do this, you're going to do that, you're going to help your friends at Solyndra.
[00:57:07.852 --> 00:57:09.133]  You didn't help anybody, Barack.
[00:57:09.213 --> 00:57:13.214]  And you integrated this and said, has he got a magic wand or whatever?
[00:57:13.234 --> 00:57:14.054]  Well, how did he do that?
[00:57:14.474 --> 00:57:15.615]  We don't know the details yet.
[00:57:16.195 --> 00:57:21.018]  The Hill and other people are saying that Trump puts companies on notice with this Carrier deal.
[00:57:21.498 --> 00:57:29.003]  They say it's a statement on Wednesday from Carrier said that there were incentives that were offered in Indiana that were an important consideration in the decision.
[00:57:29.043 --> 00:57:31.064]  So that's something we need to take a look at.
[00:57:31.525 --> 00:57:35.967]  But still there's other ways that he could have done this other than just incentivizing it to stay.
[00:57:36.007 --> 00:57:36.408]  And of course,
[00:57:37.168 --> 00:57:40.010]  These same types of things could have been done by Barack Obama.
[00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:44.912]  He did a lot of incentives to try to get solar power put in there, which I disagree with.
[00:57:44.952 --> 00:57:51.276]  I don't think that's what the government ought to be doing, is passing money from one favored industry or company to another.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.001]  But he wouldn't do that for these people.
[00:57:54.041 --> 00:57:55.802]  He wouldn't do it for the people in West Virginia.
[00:57:56.083 --> 00:58:01.046]  They say Trump's team argued the Carrier decision shows that Trump can build a positive climate for business.
[00:58:01.106 --> 00:58:01.946]  That's the key thing.
[00:58:02.546 --> 00:58:03.867]  See, that's what the president can do.
[00:58:04.107 --> 00:58:08.010]  He can create an environment that allows people to create jobs.
[00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:11.972]  He can create an environment that allows you to pursue your own economic future.
[00:58:12.012 --> 00:58:14.314]  Maybe that's even the path up for you.
[00:58:14.334 --> 00:58:17.355]  That economic mobility is to even create your own company.
[00:58:17.936 --> 00:58:32.365]  They said if you create a climate where employers feel the incentives are good enough to stay, taxes will be lowered, regulations won't be oppressive, they won't be under the burden of Obamacare, they'll feel like it's a more hospitable business climate, many of them may reconsider and stay, said Kellyanne Conway.
[00:58:32.425 --> 00:58:33.625]  That's what we need to see.
[00:58:33.646 --> 00:58:35.567]  We'll talk a little bit more about this on the other side of the break.
[00:58:35.587 --> 00:58:36.467]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:44.576]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.121 --> 00:58:48.308]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:51.474 --> 00:59:04.018]  Well, Barack Obama is looking pretty stupid right now, as a video has surfaced where he is seen making fun of Donald Trump for promising to stop jobs leaving the country.
[00:59:04.198 --> 00:59:05.699]  He's gonna bring all these jobs back.
[00:59:05.979 --> 00:59:07.239]  Well, how exactly are you gonna do that?
[00:59:07.259 --> 00:59:08.560]  What are you gonna do?
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:10.020]  There's no answer to it.
[00:59:10.301 --> 00:59:13.442]  He just says, I'm gonna negotiate a better deal.
[00:59:13.762 --> 00:59:16.223]  Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[00:59:16.343 --> 00:59:17.723]  What magic wand do you have?
[00:59:18.103 --> 00:59:19.744]  And usually the answer is,
[00:59:20.644 --> 00:59:21.285]  He doesn't have an answer.
[00:59:21.665 --> 00:59:29.210]  Well, Obama, President-elect Trump has yet to begin his presidency and he is already saving jobs in America.
[00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:37.115]  And he has successfully negotiated a deal with air conditioner company Carrier to keep 1,000 jobs in the U.S.
[00:59:37.435 --> 00:59:45.981]  No magic wand, just good negotiating skills and a passion to put America first and save the working class hero.
[00:59:46.001 --> 00:59:49.423]  I'm Darren McBreen and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:56.154]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:02.677 --> 01:00:09.162]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.095 --> 01:00:27.476]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:27.536 --> 01:00:29.797]  In the next segment, we're going to be joined by Gerald Cilenti.
[01:00:29.837 --> 01:00:32.498]  In this segment, I want to finish up what I was talking about with Carrier.
[01:00:32.878 --> 01:00:37.500]  What that tells us about Donald Trump's... He hasn't even hit the ground running.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:39.061]  I wouldn't say he's hit the ground running.
[01:00:39.101 --> 01:00:40.242]  He hasn't even hit the ground yet.
[01:00:40.542 --> 01:00:41.502]  But he's running the country.
[01:00:42.102 --> 01:00:44.404]  And he's running it in the right direction.
[01:00:44.824 --> 01:00:46.004]  Unlike Barack Obama.
[01:00:46.064 --> 01:00:47.185]  You just heard in that last segment.
[01:00:47.705 --> 01:00:48.726]  Obama mocking him.
[01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:49.506]  How's he going to do this?
[01:00:49.526 --> 01:00:50.467]  You got a magic wand?
[01:00:51.067 --> 01:01:00.313]  No, he's got a phone and he's going to use it instead of dictating mandates to you, he's going to call people and say, hey, let's keep these jobs here.
[01:01:00.353 --> 01:01:01.354]  Now, how did he do it?
[01:01:01.814 --> 01:01:06.557]  And that's the key thing, because as they point out, the devil is in the details.
[01:01:06.657 --> 01:01:09.799]  So did he do it by calling them up and saying, we're going to create
[01:01:10.359 --> 01:01:11.019]  We're good to go.
[01:01:34.151 --> 01:01:48.718]  If he went there and was simply using his leverage and said, look, you know, how about if we're going to buy from you as an American company here in America, wouldn't it be good if you also bought American in terms of your labor force, right?
[01:01:49.639 --> 01:01:53.841]  Why don't we say let's have a Buy American and we'll do it from the top down.
[01:01:53.901 --> 01:02:03.584]  And so these companies that are making goods instead of buying Chinese labor or buying Mexican labor, how about if they buy American labor and then we will buy your products.
[01:02:03.604 --> 01:02:06.165]  We'll buy your carrier air conditioning and if
[01:02:06.745 --> 01:02:17.835]  You've got the president coming in and saying to a major defense contractor, United Technologies that owns Carrier, maybe we'll look at you a little bit differently if you take your company out of this country.
[01:02:18.376 --> 01:02:21.739]  We won't consider you quite so much an American company anymore.
[01:02:21.819 --> 01:02:26.963]  So we might look at some people who are a little bit more loyal to America and Americans.
[01:02:27.004 --> 01:02:28.605]  That would be a good thing to do, I think.
[01:02:29.005 --> 01:02:31.608]  And we've got other people who would look askew.
[01:02:32.597 --> 01:02:32.817]  I think?
[01:02:49.949 --> 01:02:55.475]  With all these different states competing against each other to get battery factories or whatever it is.
[01:02:55.515 --> 01:03:02.062]  I mean, we've even had situations here in Austin where they tried to incentivize some investment companies to come in.
[01:03:02.102 --> 01:03:07.587]  And we look at this, usually these people get $100,000 or more per job that they create.
[01:03:07.607 --> 01:03:08.808]  We don't need to be doing that.
[01:03:09.738 --> 01:03:14.882]  They don't incentivate expansion for small and medium-sized companies.
[01:03:14.962 --> 01:03:18.444]  It's only the big guys at top that get this kind of incentive.
[01:03:18.524 --> 01:03:20.325]  So we don't need to be doing that.
[01:03:20.385 --> 01:03:22.287]  I don't like corporate welfare.
[01:03:23.828 --> 01:03:31.913]  But I think it would be a positive, as this guy, Chart Westcott, he's a Texas-based investor, he says, saving American jobs using leverage and bully pulpit of the U.S.
[01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:32.774]  President is a great thing.
[01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:45.415]  Saving American jobs by creating an environment where we have a conducive environment for doing business and all businesses, all workers benefit from that environment.
[01:03:45.516 --> 01:03:46.536]  That's a really good thing.
[01:03:46.576 --> 01:03:49.597]  And I think we can see that in this economic plan that's coming in.
[01:03:49.697 --> 01:04:01.423]  But if it's something where he's going in and he's incentivizing it by giving them special kickbacks in terms of taxes that other businesses don't get, I don't like that.
[01:04:02.182 --> 01:04:04.707]  That is special favors, that is crony capitalism.
[01:04:05.268 --> 01:04:12.963]  Now as we look at the rest of this team as it's developing, I think it's interesting that Politico calls it Trump's conservative dream team.
[01:04:13.961 --> 01:04:21.327]  One person who's with the Club for Growth, an organization that I don't necessarily usually agree with, but they say it's the most conservative cabinet since Reagan.
[01:04:22.008 --> 01:04:24.310]  I don't think he's using ideological lens to pick people.
[01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:28.233]  I think he's genuinely looking for people who share his priorities for these agencies.
[01:04:28.293 --> 01:04:32.697]  And I think when I look at his picks, there's a lot of articles today about Mnuchin.
[01:04:33.723 --> 01:04:43.586]  Pointing out his connections and others' connections to Goldman Sachs, saying, hey, he foreclosed on a 90-year-old widow for a 27-cent default on her mortgage.
[01:04:44.126 --> 01:04:44.766]  That type of thing.
[01:04:44.806 --> 01:04:52.048]  Look, these people, if they share Trump's program, I think we need to at least give them a chance and see what's happening.
[01:04:52.529 --> 01:05:00.251]  I was very concerned about some of the things that I had seen in Trump's past, but we need to look at what he is doing now.
[01:05:05.225 --> 01:05:07.386]  Let's get into the big enchilada, as you were saying.
[01:05:07.406 --> 01:05:11.809]  What, in your research view, is behind this recount that Hillary's now joined?
[01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:13.430]  She swore she wouldn't join it.
[01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:14.231]  What's behind that?
[01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:16.966]  Let's look at this for a moment.
[01:05:17.006 --> 01:05:18.907]  There's two ironic things going on here.
[01:05:19.527 --> 01:05:29.290]  When I wrote for The Hill newspaper, a long piece on the fact that I was concerned that these computerized voting machines can easily be hacked.
[01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:31.611]  You were told, Cook, it didn't exist, no such thing.
[01:05:31.651 --> 01:05:32.351]  Now she's saying that.
[01:05:32.471 --> 01:05:32.711]  Right.
[01:05:33.252 --> 01:05:37.673]  Now, suddenly, the shoe's on the other foot, and they're demanding a recount.
[01:05:38.193 --> 01:05:40.494]  Clearly, Jill Stein is fronting for someone
[01:05:41.114 --> 01:05:48.460]  She was unable to raise $5 million for the presidential campaign, but she raised $5 million overnight for a recount.
[01:05:49.401 --> 01:05:50.441]  It's now $7 million.
[01:05:51.482 --> 01:05:55.746]  The recount is unnecessary, I guess I should say, in any two-day period.
[01:05:56.546 --> 01:05:58.167]  She raised $5 million in two days.
[01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:00.649]  This didn't come from the grassroots.
[01:06:00.689 --> 01:06:03.652]  This probably came from some Hillary bot.
[01:06:03.892 --> 01:06:06.954]  Oh, they admit that, and she's only going after states Trump won.
[01:06:06.974 --> 01:06:07.715]  How obvious is that?
[01:06:08.777 --> 01:06:26.447]  Well, what's interesting in Wisconsin is the analysis of Nancy Silver, formerly of the New York Times, who points out that the inconsistencies between the returns in the paper ballots and the computerized machines is explained by demographics, not device.
[01:06:27.228 --> 01:06:30.810]  Of course, rural areas are more likely to have paper ballots.
[01:06:32.061 --> 01:06:34.143]  Urban areas are more likely to have machines.
[01:06:34.744 --> 01:06:35.164]  Duh.
[01:06:35.184 --> 01:06:37.947]  I mean, I don't think there's anything to recount here.
[01:06:38.187 --> 01:06:42.231]  They would have to, by my risk, flip, I guess, three states.
[01:06:43.112 --> 01:06:45.274]  And that's just not going to happen.
[01:06:45.554 --> 01:06:48.577]  I don't think Trump's victory is insecure anyplace.
[01:06:49.057 --> 01:06:54.683]  So this is a last-minute dodge by Soros and the boys to try to hijack this.
[01:06:57.662 --> 01:07:04.848]  And by the way, I'm queuing up the clip of her during the debate saying she would never challenge the election and that Trump was insane.
[01:07:04.868 --> 01:07:05.789]  So how does she do this now?
[01:07:06.778 --> 01:07:08.178]  That's exactly right.
[01:07:08.258 --> 01:07:16.420]  That's the other half of this, which is they excoriated him for not blindly saying, I'll accept the results of the election even if I don't know if there's been cheating.
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:25.022]  And when he wouldn't say that, they went crazy saying he was carrying the very fabric of American democracy that was undermining our democratic process.
[01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:25.222]  Sure.
[01:07:25.522 --> 01:07:27.382]  But now, the shoe's on the other foot.
[01:07:27.402 --> 01:07:30.083]  It just shows you what ethnic hypocrites the clips are.
[01:07:30.103 --> 01:07:30.323]  I agree.
[01:07:30.363 --> 01:07:31.803]  So let me ask you quick questions here.
[01:07:32.983 --> 01:07:34.024]  What is the real strategy?
[01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:36.807]  Is it just to embarrass him, make it look like he's not really the president?
[01:07:37.127 --> 01:07:40.550]  Or is it really trying to get the electors to admit they're getting death-threatened, guns pointed at them?
[01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:45.295]  I mean, that's even, you know, in the New York Times, World Net Daily's reporting on it.
[01:07:45.655 --> 01:07:49.399]  They're getting threats everywhere, and we won't know, I guess, until the 19th or the 20th of December.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.281]  Well, it's not over yet.
[01:07:52.381 --> 01:07:56.445]  I mean, it's never over until it's over, and Trump has to form a full government.
[01:07:56.545 --> 01:07:58.207]  We shall see how that works out.
[01:08:12.426 --> 01:08:14.048]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:19.095]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:25.717 --> 01:08:27.058]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:27.138 --> 01:08:30.301]  I'm David Knight, and we're joined right now by Gerald Cilenti.
[01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:33.964]  And of course, Gerald Cilenti is no stranger to the InfoWars audience.
[01:08:34.524 --> 01:08:38.587]  He's a trend forecaster, publisher of Trends Journal.
[01:08:38.627 --> 01:08:41.069]  You can find that at trendsresearch.com.
[01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:44.072]  He describes himself as a political atheist, so
[01:08:44.392 --> 01:08:51.236]  I'm curious to see what Gerald Slinty thinks about this post-election, if he's optimistic about the future.
[01:08:51.296 --> 01:08:53.017]  We've talked to him especially.
[01:08:53.397 --> 01:09:00.181]  We're very interested to have you, Gerald, at the end of each year giving us a forecast of what you think is coming up for the next year.
[01:09:00.221 --> 01:09:02.563]  So I know you're going to talk about what you think is going to be coming up.
[01:09:03.383 --> 01:09:03.664]  We're good.
[01:09:23.027 --> 01:09:25.769]  Cool down with this, but let's talk about the economy first.
[01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:38.337]  How do you feel in terms of the stock market looks very optimistic, consumers look very optimistic at this point, we've seen President Trump elect, working with Carrier, and of course as I mentioned in the last segment,
[01:09:39.157 --> 01:09:44.560]  That could be a bad thing if they are bribing this company to stay in the United States, but maybe it's a good thing.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:56.106]  Maybe he just applied pressure to them and said, hey, you're a defense contractor, you're owned by a defense contractor, United Technologies, maybe you should think about buying American labor so that we buy your American products.
[01:09:56.146 --> 01:10:00.868]  He might have also explained to them, we're going to create a very favorable environment here with a tax restructure.
[01:10:00.888 --> 01:10:02.169]  What's your take on this, Gerald?
[01:10:02.964 --> 01:10:10.562]  Well, before I go into that, and I was listening to your segment, and I'd just like to comment on a few of the things that you were talking about, if I may.
[01:10:10.582 --> 01:10:10.983]  Sure.
[01:10:11.909 --> 01:10:20.613]  And one of them is, for example, how the media, immediately after Trump's victory, how they came after him.
[01:10:20.653 --> 01:10:31.797]  I remember USA Today, the next day, you know, as soon as he showed that he won, or two days later, it was Trump goes into office with 76 or 74 lawsuits following him.
[01:10:32.278 --> 01:10:35.239]  That was the headline in USA Today when you went online.
[01:10:36.019 --> 01:10:40.420]  I want to show you the hypocrisy of the prostitute media.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:54.843]  And when I was on with Alex on election day, and Alex kept saying, this is the end of Hillary Clinton, the end of the mainstream media, and I kept repeating over and over again, I said, Alex, you got it right.
[01:10:55.483 --> 01:10:57.323]  That's exactly what we're seeing.
[01:10:58.063 --> 01:11:00.244]  The mainstream media is dead.
[01:11:01.184 --> 01:11:12.108]  They came out with all this crap about fake news because they're trying to get even with everybody else for all the wrong calls that they've made.
[01:11:12.448 --> 01:11:15.469]  They're declining revenues.
[01:11:15.529 --> 01:11:23.772]  When you're looking at newspapers, the Wall Street Journal's down 40% from what it used to be just within the last three weeks.
[01:11:24.212 --> 01:11:28.376]  You're looking at the ratings going down, plummeting after this election.
[01:11:28.757 --> 01:11:35.624]  They're doing this trying to gain lost audiences by attacking other people.
[01:11:35.904 --> 01:11:44.453]  So I want to show you the hypocrisy of these little low lives rather than whether or not you like Trump.
[01:11:45.314 --> 01:11:51.484]  And again, as a political atheist, I look at things the way they are, not the way I want them to be.
[01:11:52.005 --> 01:11:55.311]  But also, I'm an American, and I'm American first.
[01:11:56.092 --> 01:11:57.454]  So we have a new president.
[01:11:58.390 --> 01:12:08.180]  We all again, as we have over the decades, you may not have liked who you got into office, but hey, let's try to make this work the best we can.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:22.414]  I want to show you factually, rather than just speaking words, about the blatant hypocrisy of these little prostitute medias with cojones the size of mothballs.
[01:12:22.734 --> 01:12:32.119]  Oh, and by the way, I believe we should be able to say the real words, because one of the victories of Trump is, political correctness is dead.
[01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:34.400]  He killed it.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:35.860]  He murdered it.
[01:12:36.861 --> 01:12:39.222]  And also, politics is dead.
[01:12:39.802 --> 01:12:41.363]  People are disgusted with it.
[01:12:42.304 --> 01:12:46.806]  And it's not only in the United States, and we'll talk about it more, it's global.
[01:12:47.836 --> 01:12:49.937]  It's the Freedom Party in Austria.
[01:12:50.597 --> 01:12:53.838]  It's the alternative for Deutschland in Germany.
[01:12:54.879 --> 01:12:59.901]  It's Le Pen's party and the new guy that just won the primary for Lahn.
[01:13:00.441 --> 01:13:05.543]  They want to bring back the respect and dignity of what their culture is represented.
[01:13:06.063 --> 01:13:07.644]  It's not about politics.
[01:13:08.224 --> 01:13:14.027]  It's not about... Oh, the other thing they keep saying about Trump bringing in all of these people
[01:13:14.767 --> 01:13:18.388]  That are unqualified, don't have government experience.
[01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:20.148]  Oh, government experience?
[01:13:20.509 --> 01:13:21.949]  Oh, you mean a politician?
[01:13:22.269 --> 01:13:25.670]  The guys that sell you out and get paid off for it?
[01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:28.311]  And they call it campaign contributions?
[01:13:28.631 --> 01:13:31.892]  From what we used to call in the Bronx, bribes and payoffs?
[01:13:32.292 --> 01:13:33.792]  That kind of experience?
[01:13:34.292 --> 01:13:38.373]  No, he's bringing in a whole clean slate for the most part.
[01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:39.454]  Not all of it.
[01:13:39.674 --> 01:13:43.755]  He still did some political stuff, bringing in McConnell's wife and others.
[01:13:44.882 --> 01:13:51.187]  Separating that and bringing it to the higher level with Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross.
[01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:55.069]  This is a whole clean slate and looking at things differently.
[01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:57.611]  But I want to go back to the hypocrisy.
[01:13:58.192 --> 01:14:03.475]  Here's Obama, the media promoting the liar-in-chief.
[01:14:03.836 --> 01:14:05.197]  Oh, no experience?
[01:14:05.577 --> 01:14:09.360]  How about I'm a community organizer from Chicago?
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:20.469]  He organized nothing, and I wrote about it in the Trends Journal before he got elected, admitting that he did nothing of any substance as a community organizer.
[01:14:20.749 --> 01:14:34.400]  Oh, that little boy, that liar-in-chief you mentioned about, the Nobel Peace or Crap Prize winner, who gets into office and then it escalates the Afghan war by 33,000 troops.
[01:14:35.321 --> 01:14:38.223]  Thousands of, over a thousand of our men killed.
[01:14:39.244 --> 01:14:40.444]  Thousands wounded.
[01:14:40.925 --> 01:14:43.605]  Slaughtered tens of thousands of Afghans.
[01:14:43.925 --> 01:14:45.626]  The Libyan war.
[01:14:45.666 --> 01:14:50.647]  Here is the coverage immediately after Obama won.
[01:14:51.008 --> 01:14:57.149]  Now compare it to the little prostitutes that are attacking Trump on every little issue.
[01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:58.850]  Check out that cover.
[01:14:59.861 --> 01:15:00.241]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:01.102 --> 01:15:01.363]  New.
[01:15:02.383 --> 01:15:02.964]  New York.
[01:15:03.384 --> 01:15:03.925]  All new.
[01:15:03.985 --> 01:15:04.806]  You ready for this?
[01:15:05.526 --> 01:15:09.730]  The truly radical politics of Barack Obama.
[01:15:10.271 --> 01:15:11.492]  Radical politics?
[01:15:11.792 --> 01:15:14.014]  Hey, you little lying SOB!
[01:15:14.415 --> 01:15:18.899]  You promised to bring in a whole new crew when you went into Washington.
[01:15:19.119 --> 01:15:20.800]  You were gonna sweep it clean!
[01:15:21.201 --> 01:15:22.462]  And who did you bring in?
[01:15:23.143 --> 01:15:25.144]  You brought in Bush's murderers!
[01:15:25.825 --> 01:15:27.669]  You brought in the Clinton team.
[01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.711]  Radical?
[01:15:29.152 --> 01:15:29.453]  Yeah.
[01:15:29.913 --> 01:15:31.276]  You guys got it wrong.
[01:15:31.517 --> 01:15:33.881]  New Yorker, you're full of crap.
[01:15:34.282 --> 01:15:34.984]  I got more.
[01:15:35.845 --> 01:15:36.447]  Newsweek.
[01:15:37.341 --> 01:15:38.942]  Look at that picture, huh?
[01:15:39.462 --> 01:15:41.243]  Wow, does he look brilliant.
[01:15:41.583 --> 01:15:42.503]  What do we have here?
[01:15:42.944 --> 01:15:44.504]  Obama's America.
[01:15:45.065 --> 01:15:46.405]  Who we are now.
[01:15:47.206 --> 01:15:49.447]  Oh, hope and change you can believe in.
[01:15:49.767 --> 01:15:51.147]  Yes, small change.
[01:15:51.468 --> 01:15:53.889]  Hey, got change of a penny?
[01:15:53.909 --> 01:15:55.369]  Here we go.
[01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:56.590]  Look at this.
[01:15:57.190 --> 01:15:58.451]  Look at this, huh?
[01:15:58.931 --> 01:16:00.772]  The perfect first family.
[01:16:02.463 --> 01:16:07.928]  Introducing President Obama as Barack and Michelle settle into the White House.
[01:16:08.429 --> 01:16:12.693]  How will this new era change America and TV?
[01:16:13.293 --> 01:16:14.395]  How will it change it?
[01:16:14.755 --> 01:16:16.376]  Again, no change.
[01:16:16.757 --> 01:16:18.759]  More the same political crap.
[01:16:19.119 --> 01:16:21.081]  A guy that lied his way into office.
[01:16:21.341 --> 01:16:22.462]  Again, I'm doing this
[01:16:23.283 --> 01:16:34.350]  To show the juxtaposition of how the media came out and is attacking Trump immediately after he got elected while they're kissing Obama's you-know-what.
[01:16:35.511 --> 01:16:37.132]  Oh, it's a total love fest.
[01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:38.213]  It's absolutely amazing.
[01:16:38.253 --> 01:16:38.873]  Yeah, look at that.
[01:16:38.893 --> 01:16:39.354]  Look at this.
[01:16:42.096 --> 01:16:45.498]  The new president and the burdens that await him.
[01:16:46.058 --> 01:16:47.859]  Great expectations.
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:52.843]  This little clown of a traitor of a man talking about
[01:16:54.363 --> 01:16:58.385]  Trump, not having the experience to do anything.
[01:16:58.805 --> 01:17:04.967]  Great expectations again from a community organizer that organized nothing.
[01:17:05.707 --> 01:17:18.811]  A little nothing of a man with a bad attitude who learned how to act really well when Oprah Winfrey took her under his arm and made him the great teleprompted president.
[01:17:19.532 --> 01:17:20.212]  I got more.
[01:17:21.701 --> 01:17:22.121]  You ready?
[01:17:22.482 --> 01:17:23.382]  Yeah, let's go for it.
[01:17:24.543 --> 01:17:25.344]  Obama!
[01:17:27.065 --> 01:17:30.267]  The celebrity of the century!
[01:17:30.867 --> 01:17:31.208]  Wow!
[01:17:31.388 --> 01:17:32.849]  That was actually correct.
[01:17:32.889 --> 01:17:34.610]  He is just a celebrity to them, isn't he?
[01:17:35.291 --> 01:17:36.291]  That's all it is.
[01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:40.895]  Hey, politics is show business for ugly people.
[01:17:40.915 --> 01:17:41.295]  That's right.
[01:17:41.335 --> 01:17:42.656]  We have the proof.
[01:17:43.416 --> 01:17:44.537]  You ready for this one?
[01:17:45.118 --> 01:17:47.079]  This one may knock you off your chair.
[01:17:47.099 --> 01:17:48.320]  So hold on.
[01:17:51.769 --> 01:17:52.269]  Hamilton!
[01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:56.390]  He's on the role of Alexander Hamilton on Broadway now.
[01:17:56.610 --> 01:17:58.551]  That's what he's going to do after he leaves office.
[01:17:59.451 --> 01:18:00.072]  You got it.
[01:18:00.912 --> 01:18:02.892]  Look at this hypocrisy.
[01:18:03.593 --> 01:18:04.193]  Oh, that's funny.
[01:18:05.293 --> 01:18:08.454]  So, I just wanted to pick up on what you were saying.
[01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:10.255]  You know, he offered us hope, Gerald.
[01:18:10.535 --> 01:18:12.295]  What we got was the envious socialism.
[01:18:12.735 --> 01:18:20.758]  He said we're going to have change, but what he tried to do was to, and successfully nearly, pretty much shut down and did bankrupt the coal industry pretty close to it.
[01:18:21.278 --> 01:18:30.426]  But also changing America by bringing in people who are workers, bringing in people from these countries that they destroyed, that they set on fire.
[01:18:30.667 --> 01:18:31.848]  He wants to change America.
[01:18:31.888 --> 01:18:33.729]  He wants to change America demographically.
[01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:36.412]  And so we've seen a lot of that stuff.
[01:18:36.432 --> 01:18:42.637]  But I think what we're really seeing now is a real hope from Americans that we're going to see something done about the economy.
[01:18:42.738 --> 01:18:43.698]  And it's truly amazing.
[01:18:44.199 --> 01:18:46.221]  Have you ever, Gerald, seen a president
[01:18:47.041 --> 01:18:48.442]  Certainly not a president-elect.
[01:18:49.003 --> 01:18:53.565]  Get out and already stop two factories that we're going to be moving out of the United States.
[01:18:54.466 --> 01:18:55.227]  No, again.
[01:18:55.267 --> 01:18:55.907]  I've never seen that.
[01:18:56.207 --> 01:18:58.289]  This is one of our top trends.
[01:18:58.589 --> 01:18:58.829]  Yeah.
[01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:00.450]  It's new.
[01:19:01.451 --> 01:19:03.252]  It's the end of politics.
[01:19:04.417 --> 01:19:10.100]  These guys, look, I began my career just briefly at a graduate school.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.881]  I used to run political campaigns.
[01:19:11.921 --> 01:19:15.783]  The first one, I was the number two guy running the campaign in Yonkers, New York.
[01:19:16.143 --> 01:19:18.284]  And we're talking a city of 300,000 people.
[01:19:18.624 --> 01:19:24.547]  And I worked in Westchester County, the richest county in America at the time, running political campaigns.
[01:19:24.907 --> 01:19:32.816]  I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate, designed and instructed American politics and campaign technology at St.
[01:19:32.836 --> 01:19:37.380]  John's University, and I was a Chief Government Affairs Specialist in D.C.
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.262]  for many years for the chemical industry.
[01:19:39.823 --> 01:19:41.605]  I had pictures of me and Reagan, this one, that one.
[01:19:42.266 --> 01:19:43.267]  I know what it looks like.
[01:19:43.547 --> 01:19:44.468]  There's nothing there.
[01:19:44.808 --> 01:19:46.250]  They're low-life politicians.
[01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:47.711]  Yeah, I agree, absolutely.
[01:19:47.731 --> 01:19:48.752]  We've got to take a quick break.
[01:19:48.772 --> 01:19:52.435]  We're going to be right back with Gerald Cilenti, TrendsResearch.com.
[01:19:52.475 --> 01:19:53.256]  Thank you so much, Gerald.
[01:19:53.376 --> 01:19:55.177]  Looking forward to hearing what you have to say about 2017.
[01:19:55.277 --> 01:19:58.720]  What do you see as the trends for 2017?
[01:20:11.218 --> 01:20:19.141]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:21.142]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[01:20:21.902 --> 01:20:28.805]  We can easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand different products.
[01:20:29.405 --> 01:20:35.188]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20, because we private label some, but we also develop
[01:20:36.087 --> 01:20:45.850]  Many of the products originally were some of the top labs in the country, so that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe, and they're also very affordable.
[01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:48.011]  Exactly, you talk about being a game changer, right?
[01:20:48.031 --> 01:20:52.652]  You talk about, we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders, we've both talked to them.
[01:20:52.992 --> 01:20:58.896]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[01:20:59.236 --> 01:21:08.202]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[01:21:09.063 --> 01:21:10.183]  We refuse to screw people.
[01:21:10.524 --> 01:21:11.484]  We refuse to do that.
[01:21:11.865 --> 01:21:14.546]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[01:21:14.606 --> 01:21:16.548]  We're producing something we want to take.
[01:21:16.648 --> 01:21:17.048]  Exactly.
[01:21:17.428 --> 01:21:18.448]  We're looking for the best.
[01:21:18.508 --> 01:21:23.369]  We went out and searched for the best to private label, and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[01:21:23.569 --> 01:21:27.230]  So we go to these big firms and say, we want to make the dream formula.
[01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:33.431]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[01:21:33.511 --> 01:21:34.731]  It's everywhere.
[01:21:34.911 --> 01:21:35.591]  It's in nature.
[01:21:35.651 --> 01:21:37.652]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[01:21:38.112 --> 01:21:44.173]  Just this bottle of silica, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount than even in our product, is $35.
[01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:50.597]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[01:21:50.617 --> 01:21:51.277]  This is insane.
[01:21:51.297 --> 01:21:57.922]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, OK, I get that you guys want to do high power stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000?
[01:21:58.423 --> 01:22:00.444]  And then you can sell multiple bottles of it.
[01:22:00.484 --> 01:22:01.385]  People will buy more of it.
[01:22:01.485 --> 01:22:02.086]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[01:22:02.166 --> 01:22:03.947]  OK, compare that to this.
[01:22:04.167 --> 01:22:06.909]  This is a $50 product, one of the leaders in the industry.
[01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:08.971]  It has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[01:22:09.031 --> 01:22:09.391]  OK, we have 10,000.
[01:22:09.431 --> 01:22:10.172]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[01:22:13.234 --> 01:22:15.076]  There's no script, there's no teleprompter, I'll just be honest with you.
[01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:20.743]  My problem is, with 20 products now, it's remembering to take them all.
[01:22:20.763 --> 01:22:24.647]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[01:22:25.047 --> 01:22:31.014]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product,
[01:22:32.125 --> 01:22:33.746]  My quality of life just isn't as good.
[01:22:33.826 --> 01:22:34.926]  It's changed my life.
[01:22:35.006 --> 01:22:37.247]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[01:22:37.587 --> 01:22:39.467]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[01:22:39.868 --> 01:22:41.308]  I was jogging, lifting weights.
[01:22:41.368 --> 01:22:42.228]  I couldn't lose the weight.
[01:22:43.129 --> 01:22:50.191]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWars change the country and the world.
[01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:51.351]  It's a win-win.
[01:22:51.832 --> 01:22:52.592]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:23:02.799 --> 01:23:04.621]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[01:23:06.263 --> 01:23:11.950]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:23:12.650 --> 01:23:16.535]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:23:17.486 --> 01:23:19.709]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:23:19.809 --> 01:23:20.950]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:23:20.970 --> 01:23:24.194]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[01:23:25.175 --> 01:23:25.516]  Or more.
[01:23:25.616 --> 01:23:27.338]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:23:28.039 --> 01:23:29.520]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:32.944]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:23:33.064 --> 01:23:34.827]  It's actually scary.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:45.825]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:23:46.785 --> 01:23:59.591]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.971]  Yeah!
[01:24:13.524 --> 01:24:14.784]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:14.825 --> 01:24:18.506]  I'm David Knight and our guest is Gerald Slenty, Trend Forecaster.
[01:24:19.026 --> 01:24:20.847]  He's a publisher of Trends Journal.
[01:24:20.867 --> 01:24:23.408]  You can find him at TrendsResearch.com.
[01:24:23.708 --> 01:24:29.650]  And of course, if you're a regular listener to InfoWars, you hear Gerald Slenty on frequently.
[01:24:29.730 --> 01:24:31.350]  Very, very wise person.
[01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:34.692]  I want to hear what he has to say about trends coming up.
[01:24:34.772 --> 01:24:41.094]  And you know, as you were talking about the aftermath of the election, Gerald, you said that immediately they began attacking Trump.
[01:24:41.975 --> 01:24:49.362]  We have seen that type of thing come after each one of his picks, but the issue is, is he going to keep his campaign promises?
[01:24:49.402 --> 01:24:58.051]  We just had an election, people said he made some commitments, some policies that he wanted to do, and people want to give him a chance to see if that's going to happen.
[01:24:58.111 --> 01:25:04.398]  One of the ways that they've attacked him is immediately after the election, they said, well, you're not really serious about this policy or that policy or the other one, are you?
[01:25:04.858 --> 01:25:09.722]  Or they look at it and they say, well, because of these people that he's got here, they're going to subvert him and co-opt this.
[01:25:09.742 --> 01:25:11.243]  And that's something we need to be concerned about.
[01:25:11.263 --> 01:25:13.865]  We need to keep an eye on that, hold his feet to the fire.
[01:25:13.885 --> 01:25:18.729]  But right now, he's running full speed in the same direction that he was in the campaign.
[01:25:18.789 --> 01:25:20.391]  As a matter of fact, I think he's doubled down.
[01:25:20.431 --> 01:25:26.035]  He cleared his desk of this $25 million lawsuit at a large cost to himself.
[01:25:26.095 --> 01:25:26.976]  I think he believed that
[01:25:27.416 --> 01:25:27.636]  I think.
[01:25:45.493 --> 01:25:57.257]  If they deliver on their promises, and it looks like when we see Mnuchin come out and after he's picked his Treasury Secretary, he goes right down the list of the economic policies that Trump wanted to accomplish and said, these are our priorities.
[01:25:57.277 --> 01:25:58.498]  So it looks like they're on the same page.
[01:25:59.178 --> 01:26:04.240]  If they deliver, as Bannon said, we will probably see a restructure of politics for 50 years.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.320]  But here's the other thing.
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:16.588]  Gerald, if they don't deliver on these promises, I think we're going to see a big lurch, a blowback, and see the country lurch to the left towards socialism again.
[01:26:16.649 --> 01:26:22.453]  But let's hope that they're going to move forward and fulfill these promises that they've said to people.
[01:26:22.473 --> 01:26:23.274]  How do you feel about that?
[01:26:24.114 --> 01:26:29.458]  Well, in our trend forecast, we're saying that Trump has two years to do whatever he wants to do.
[01:26:30.643 --> 01:26:31.924]  There's nothing there to stop him.
[01:26:31.984 --> 01:26:34.387]  There are, again, it's the death of politics.
[01:26:34.807 --> 01:26:35.048]  Yes.
[01:26:35.148 --> 01:26:40.113]  Ryan McConnell, Lindsey Graham, McCain, he took over the Republican Party.
[01:26:40.453 --> 01:26:47.220]  He went for the top, he knocked out Jeb Bush in the first round of the first presidential debate of the Republican Party.
[01:26:47.901 --> 01:26:48.841]  There's nothing there.
[01:26:49.101 --> 01:26:55.703]  Again, I was mentioning before my history in being there, I know how easy it is to change it.
[01:26:56.323 --> 01:26:57.644]  And that's very important.
[01:26:58.224 --> 01:27:03.865]  So he's going to do what he wants to do and what they won't push through who go directly to the people for.
[01:27:04.605 --> 01:27:09.827]  Just as he's doing it now and bypassing the media by using whether it's Twitter or YouTube.
[01:27:10.606 --> 01:27:15.068]  On the economic front, let's go back again prior to the election.
[01:27:15.888 --> 01:27:19.570]  The markets went up and down on Hillary Clinton's poll ratings.
[01:27:20.371 --> 01:27:23.132]  When Hillary Clinton was up in the polls, the market would go up.
[01:27:24.073 --> 01:27:27.614]  When she went down in the polls, the markets would go down.
[01:27:28.374 --> 01:27:52.458]  Just before election day, when the FBI Director Comey decided not to pursue any more action against Clinton on a Friday, Monday, the day before election day, the market closed up 371 points on the anticipation that Clinton would win and that it would be positive for the stock market and
[01:27:53.587 --> 01:27:57.128]  It would be negative if Trump got in.
[01:27:57.508 --> 01:28:00.388]  And if Trump got in, also it would be negative for gold.
[01:28:00.968 --> 01:28:02.149]  The reverse has happened.
[01:28:02.929 --> 01:28:06.509]  We're seeing a rally in the stock market like nothing we've seen.
[01:28:07.210 --> 01:28:11.090]  With three of the indexes reaching all-time highs and gold going much lower.
[01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:14.511]  So our forecast is this, and we revised it.
[01:28:15.871 --> 01:28:19.992]  And that is that we're going to see continued growth in the economy.
[01:28:21.019 --> 01:28:24.021]  And that Trump's policies, a lot of them make sense.
[01:28:24.561 --> 01:28:33.145]  However, to put it all out there, on the thing about rebuilding the infrastructure, it's only a trillion dollars over several years.
[01:28:33.205 --> 01:28:34.346]  They say up to ten.
[01:28:34.886 --> 01:28:37.067]  That's only a hundred billion dollars a year.
[01:28:38.536 --> 01:28:42.039]  And in a size of an economy this big, that doesn't account for much.
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:54.331]  And to put it back into perspective, when the liar-in-chief got elected, the conmander Obama, in 2009, he came up with a stimulus program of $830 billion.
[01:28:54.671 --> 01:28:56.513]  And it didn't do anything.
[01:28:57.153 --> 01:29:00.256]  So it has to be much bigger than that, and the plans aren't clear.
[01:29:01.823 --> 01:29:13.791]  The reality is that what they're saying about cutting taxes across the board and about renegotiating trade deals overseas is very positive.
[01:29:14.191 --> 01:29:15.752]  The deals do stink.
[01:29:15.912 --> 01:29:18.033]  Again, you look at the facts, David.
[01:29:18.393 --> 01:29:25.178]  What do we have, 22 years of negative trade policy with Mexico?
[01:29:25.718 --> 01:29:26.359]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:38.571]  We've had a rough parity with them and immediately as NAFTA was published, or passed, we had a $15 billion deficit with them and it's gone as high as $75 billion.
[01:29:38.591 --> 01:29:41.353]  It's never gone below $15 billion in all these years.
[01:29:41.774 --> 01:29:45.437]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with Gerald Cilenti looking at trends for 2017.
[01:29:50.395 --> 01:29:53.381]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.323 --> 01:29:57.008]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:06.181]  If you ever wanted to keep your lights on, maybe run emergency appliances when the power goes out.
[01:30:06.421 --> 01:30:08.661]  This could be one of the most important messages you'll ever hear.
[01:30:08.962 --> 01:30:09.502]  Here's why.
[01:30:09.782 --> 01:30:12.842]  There's a new solar generator out that pretty much everyone can afford.
[01:30:13.182 --> 01:30:19.464]  It provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[01:30:19.704 --> 01:30:20.464]  But here's the key.
[01:30:20.864 --> 01:30:23.604]  It's so small you can put it in your pocket or glove compartment.
[01:30:23.845 --> 01:30:24.845]  Now this is really cool.
[01:30:25.065 --> 01:30:28.145]  Probably one of the best off-the-grid products I've seen in a while.
[01:30:28.305 --> 01:30:31.026]  And you've got to watch some of the crazy videos on this website.
[01:30:31.186 --> 01:30:32.186]  You won't believe your eyes.
[01:30:32.646 --> 01:30:33.426]  A true innovation.
[01:30:33.666 --> 01:30:35.247]  I have never seen anything like this.
[01:30:35.647 --> 01:30:37.407]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:30:37.527 --> 01:30:40.608]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com and check this out.

[01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:52.410]  Even better, you'll also receive $300 in off-the-grid bonuses, all while supplies last.
[01:30:52.730 --> 01:30:56.791]  Watch all the survival and self-reliance videos at PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:58.832]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:30:58.992 --> 01:31:00.692]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[01:31:01.215 --> 01:31:13.745]  Well, Barack Obama is looking pretty stupid right now as a video has surfaced where he is seen making fun of Donald Trump for promising to stop jobs leaving the country.
[01:31:13.925 --> 01:31:15.446]  He's going to bring all these jobs back.
[01:31:15.707 --> 01:31:17.028]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that?
[01:31:17.068 --> 01:31:17.708]  What are you going to do?
[01:31:18.889 --> 01:31:19.769]  There's no answer to it.
[01:31:20.009 --> 01:31:23.150]  He just says, well, I'm gonna negotiate a better deal.
[01:31:23.490 --> 01:31:25.951]  Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[01:31:26.071 --> 01:31:27.451]  What magic wand do you have?
[01:31:27.831 --> 01:31:31.032]  And usually the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.
[01:31:31.392 --> 01:31:38.934]  Well, Obama, President-elect Trump has yet to begin his presidency, and he is already saving jobs in America.
[01:31:39.074 --> 01:31:45.096]  And he has successfully negotiated a deal with air conditioner company Carrier to keep 1,000 jobs in the U.S.
[01:31:47.156 --> 01:31:55.685]  No magic wand, just good negotiating skills and a passion to put America first and save the working class hero.
[01:31:55.705 --> 01:31:59.009]  I'm Darren McBreen and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.

[01:32:22.177 --> 01:32:27.641]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[01:32:27.981 --> 01:32:35.507]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[01:32:35.747 --> 01:32:40.211]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[01:32:40.471 --> 01:32:49.318]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[01:32:49.518 --> 01:32:52.741]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[01:33:12.292 --> 01:33:18.536]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.082 --> 01:33:25.303]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.343 --> 01:33:27.744]  I'm David Knight and my guest is Gerald Salenti.
[01:33:28.024 --> 01:33:35.248]  We're talking about trends coming up in the next year and also what Gerald sees in the wake of the election.
[01:33:35.889 --> 01:33:44.013]  One of the things that we've been seeing, of course, is the push saying that everything is fake news, that is not real fake news.
[01:33:44.053 --> 01:33:51.358]  In other words, the people who have been giving us fake news for decades, CNN, Washington Post, all these people, their new narrative is, of course, fake news.
[01:33:51.418 --> 01:33:53.219]  But we're also seeing some teeth put into that.
[01:33:53.979 --> 01:33:58.163]  We see Kellogg's pulling their sponsorship from Breitbart.
[01:33:58.744 --> 01:34:02.547]  Breitbart coming back and saying, OK, well, let's boycott Kellogg then.
[01:34:02.827 --> 01:34:05.810]  And take a look at what Amnesty International says about their products.
[01:34:06.191 --> 01:34:12.016]  They're not only are they, do they have garbage like palm oil in them, but they also do it with child labor.
[01:34:12.096 --> 01:34:15.840]  And so that became the number one hashtag trend on Twitter.
[01:34:17.298 --> 01:34:19.239]  That's what we're trying to do here at InfoWars.
[01:34:19.259 --> 01:34:28.422]  We're trying to give you products that are good for your health and also have a financial independence from these kinds of corporate sponsors that can try to shut down our operation.
[01:34:29.022 --> 01:34:31.743]  And I just want to remind you that we've got Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink.
[01:34:32.661 --> 01:34:34.922]  That's back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[01:34:34.962 --> 01:34:39.665]  And of course, that's the Affordable Great Tasting Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix.
[01:34:39.865 --> 01:34:46.269]  It's loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body needs.
[01:34:46.729 --> 01:34:49.030]  It's the platinum standard of multivitamin products.
[01:34:49.090 --> 01:34:50.811]  It's a very easy to take format.
[01:34:50.831 --> 01:34:51.471]  You can just drink it.
[01:34:51.491 --> 01:34:52.972]  It's not a lot of pills that you have to swallow.
[01:34:53.452 --> 01:34:55.894]  A full multivitamin drink mix.
[01:34:55.974 --> 01:34:59.396]  It's all plant derived from the highest quality lab standards.
[01:34:59.496 --> 01:35:01.317]  So these things are either
[01:35:02.786 --> 01:35:03.306]  Plant-derived.
[01:35:03.326 --> 01:35:04.807]  There's nothing in it that is GMO.
[01:35:04.887 --> 01:35:07.148]  It's got all the types of vitamins that you need.
[01:35:07.188 --> 01:35:09.890]  Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Zinc, Magnesium, Selenium.
[01:35:10.490 --> 01:35:11.110]  All these different things.
[01:35:11.130 --> 01:35:16.513]  You can take a look at our reviews on Infowarslife.com as well as the ingredients in it.
[01:35:16.553 --> 01:35:20.275]  You see that it gives you a broad base of support for your diet.
[01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:22.456]  That's how we keep our independence.
[01:35:22.636 --> 01:35:39.362]  That's how we help you with high quality products that will help you and your family to maintain your health and protect you from the kind of toxic things that you're exposed to constantly in the environment, in your diet, in the cosmetics that you come in contact with, from soaps to shampoos.
[01:35:39.442 --> 01:35:42.043]  So take a look at the products that we have at Infowarslife.com.
[01:35:42.083 --> 01:35:43.584]  That's the way we support our operation.
[01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:45.325]  We thank you for your support.
[01:35:45.345 --> 01:35:45.765]  Now, Gerald,
[01:35:46.425 --> 01:35:57.449]  In the last segment, you were talking about the fact that at Trends Journal, you said that Donald Trump had about two years to do whatever he wanted, because he's got a majority in the House and Senate, and he's got an agenda.
[01:35:57.509 --> 01:36:00.790]  One of the key things in that is to get rid of Obamacare.
[01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:10.173]  And we see on Politico, of course, they're always going to be pushing an agenda that is anti-Trump and anti-Obama.
[01:36:11.207 --> 01:36:12.607]  Anti-Republican, anti-freedom.
[01:36:12.647 --> 01:36:16.308]  They're saying that the GOP may delay Obamacare replacement for years.
[01:36:16.328 --> 01:36:19.269]  They would love to see this and quite frankly that is the great danger.
[01:36:19.769 --> 01:36:23.610]  Is that the GOP establishment would drag their heels on Obamacare.
[01:36:23.630 --> 01:36:35.132]  They say that the both sides of Capitol Hill are coalescing around a plan to vote to repeal the law in early 2017 but to delay the effective date for that repeal as long as three years.
[01:36:35.192 --> 01:36:35.792]  If they do that
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:40.263]  That really is going to be a problem for the Trump administration.
[01:36:40.283 --> 01:36:41.364]  I think he needs to move quickly.
[01:36:41.404 --> 01:36:42.445]  I think he is going to move quickly.
[01:36:42.465 --> 01:36:44.407]  He's talked about what he's going to do in the first 100 days.
[01:36:44.427 --> 01:36:45.267]  He's been very active.
[01:36:45.748 --> 01:36:49.150]  Here we are even still 50 days before he becomes president.
[01:36:49.210 --> 01:36:50.191]  What's your take on this?
[01:36:50.211 --> 01:37:02.101]  Do you think that the GOP establishment, which we all know really would like to see Obamacare continue, do you think they're going to drag their feet and subvert this effort to try to get rid of Obamacare?
[01:37:02.944 --> 01:37:05.986]  Again, there's nothing standing in Trump's way.
[01:37:06.026 --> 01:37:07.427]  He'll do whatever he wants to do.
[01:37:07.447 --> 01:37:12.570]  He'll steamroll over Ryan McConnell, Graham McCain.
[01:37:12.951 --> 01:37:14.532]  He did it before and he'll do it again.
[01:37:14.552 --> 01:37:17.313]  Again, that's the point I wanted to keep making.
[01:37:17.754 --> 01:37:25.259]  When you're inside that club and you're an outsider, you know how easy it is to change it.
[01:37:26.019 --> 01:37:27.080]  And he knows that.
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:30.001]  I mean, he spent his lifetime around these people.
[01:37:30.041 --> 01:37:31.102]  He knows who they are.
[01:37:31.542 --> 01:37:35.684]  He knows how he bought them off and did what he wanted to do.
[01:37:36.385 --> 01:37:38.706]  So they're not going to be able to stop him at all.
[01:37:39.046 --> 01:37:52.294]  And I also want to follow up on what you were saying also about the products that you're selling and the independence of InfoWars and the need for it, particularly in this time as we're seeing the collapse.
[01:37:52.354 --> 01:37:54.335]  There is no more fourth estate.
[01:37:54.935 --> 01:38:00.357]  The fourth estate being the one that watched over the judicial, the executive, and the congressional branch.
[01:38:00.417 --> 01:38:06.260]  They're dead, as we see by the prostitutes that keep selling the beltway lies.
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:13.263]  And the products that you sell, because people ask me continually, what can I do to make positive change?
[01:38:13.923 --> 01:38:23.107]  And I keep saying, well, the first thing is that you have to be in the best shape you can possibly be in, spiritually, emotionally, and physically.
[01:38:23.687 --> 01:38:26.310]  And I don't mean religious when I say spiritually.
[01:38:26.330 --> 01:38:28.692]  I'm talking, you know, in a different tone.
[01:38:29.132 --> 01:38:46.387]  But on the physical and the products that you're bringing to the public, as opposed to, for example, like you were talking about Kellogg and the other crap out there, it's not only essential for the people, for themselves personally, to consider supporting
[01:38:47.148 --> 01:38:52.670]  Infowars and other organizations that are doing not the alternative news.
[01:38:52.730 --> 01:38:54.191]  We're the real news now.
[01:38:54.571 --> 01:38:55.852]  That's the alternative.
[01:38:56.212 --> 01:39:03.795]  But also to get in the best shape that you can get into so that you can keep pushing this movement forward.
[01:39:04.275 --> 01:39:07.517]  And the movement forward is happening around the world.
[01:39:07.897 --> 01:39:10.698]  Look what they just did over there in South Korea.
[01:39:11.977 --> 01:39:16.920]  People went to the streets and they just about threw out their President Park.
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:19.862]  Look what's going on in South Africa.
[01:39:19.962 --> 01:39:23.804]  Look what's going on in France, in England with Brexit, in Italy.
[01:39:23.864 --> 01:39:25.605]  By the way, this is very important.
[01:39:26.246 --> 01:39:35.311]  This Sunday is going to be a referendum in Italy whether or not to go along with Fonzi's constitutional amendment.
[01:39:35.411 --> 01:39:36.332]  I mean, Renzi.
[01:39:37.653 --> 01:39:39.194]  Maybe Renzi jumped the shark too, huh?
[01:39:39.674 --> 01:39:41.456]  Yeah.
[01:39:42.196 --> 01:39:53.425]  And if that's defeated, you're going to see chaos in the global markets, particularly in the banking markets in Europe, that are going to be very, very shaking on Monday.
[01:39:53.826 --> 01:40:01.752]  So people should really be in touch with that, plus the election of the Freedom Party in Austria on Sunday.
[01:40:02.353 --> 01:40:06.136]  So what I'm saying is these movements all tie together.
[01:40:06.696 --> 01:40:06.916]  Yes.
[01:40:06.976 --> 01:40:19.458]  And it's happening in America, but again, the people have to go out and support not only with their boots on the ground in America, but also to put their money where their mind is.
[01:40:20.178 --> 01:40:26.500]  So going back to what Trump is going to do with Obamacare, he's going to do what he wants.
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:34.381]  There will be nothing standing in his way from, again, from a guy that's been on the other side and seeing the lay of the land.
[01:40:34.841 --> 01:40:41.346]  And particularly the two people that he brought in with the Treasury Secretary and Commerce.
[01:40:41.987 --> 01:40:44.369]  They're two very strong-willed guys.
[01:40:44.489 --> 01:40:51.835]  Like them or not, the things they've done, the fact is, they know that the deals stink and they have to be redesigned.
[01:40:52.316 --> 01:40:55.798]  Now, I want to talk about also the negatives.
[01:40:56.519 --> 01:41:00.723]  And that is, interest rates are going up and the dollar's getting stronger.
[01:41:01.403 --> 01:41:06.784]  We're now at the dollars hitting almost a 14-year high against the basket of currencies.
[01:41:08.104 --> 01:41:24.147]  The stronger the dollar gets, David, all of this money that was borrowed under quantitative easing and all of this negative and zero interest rate policy, particularly in the emerging markets, they borrowed it in dollars.
[01:41:25.108 --> 01:41:26.868]  As the dollar gets stronger,
[01:41:27.912 --> 01:41:34.517]  They have to pay back that debt as their currencies get weaker with more of their currencies.
[01:41:35.477 --> 01:41:45.624]  So we're looking at, depending on this 95%, according to the experts, that they're going to raise interest rates in a few weeks, the Fed.
[01:41:46.585 --> 01:41:48.346]  How much will they raise them?
[01:41:49.386 --> 01:41:55.168]  And how much will those raise in interest rates also affect the housing market?
[01:41:55.408 --> 01:42:01.431]  You're seeing already warnings coming out from the people in the auto industry.
[01:42:01.931 --> 01:42:03.311]  David, you don't have a job?
[01:42:03.772 --> 01:42:04.672]  You lost yours?
[01:42:04.692 --> 01:42:05.612]  You don't have a house?
[01:42:05.632 --> 01:42:08.113]  You have no income coming in, but you want a new car?
[01:42:08.493 --> 01:42:10.394]  Come on over, I'll sell you one!
[01:42:10.634 --> 01:42:10.834]  Yeah.
[01:42:10.874 --> 01:42:12.255]  You remember what they've been doing.
[01:42:12.275 --> 01:42:12.735]  Oh yeah.
[01:42:13.075 --> 01:42:19.399]  Now, with interest rates going up, there's already panic starting to hit the auto industry.
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:24.122]  So this isn't going to be smooth sailing, is what I'm saying.
[01:42:24.723 --> 01:42:30.407]  So going back to gold, gold right now is in bear market territory.
[01:42:31.427 --> 01:42:32.708]  The amount that it's lost.
[01:42:33.628 --> 01:42:42.254]  And the downside we're saying could be about another $100, which in comparison to where it could go, we see is very small.
[01:42:42.554 --> 01:42:44.475]  And again, this is not financial advice.
[01:42:44.495 --> 01:42:45.796]  I'm a forecaster.
[01:42:46.596 --> 01:42:55.641]  What I'm saying is that with the other destabilization going on, particularly in the world markets, we could talk about the U.S.
[01:42:55.741 --> 01:43:01.224]  index, take a look at the euro indexes, the DAX, the CAC, the Italian FTSE.
[01:43:01.644 --> 01:43:04.826]  Italian FTSE is down almost 24 percent, 24 points this year.
[01:43:08.568 --> 01:43:10.329]  Excuse me, 24%.
[01:43:10.829 --> 01:43:14.851]  The only one up is England, and they're talking about Brexit.
[01:43:15.171 --> 01:43:19.993]  So what I'm saying is, you can't only look at the United States.
[01:43:20.473 --> 01:43:24.855]  You have to take a global view of this and put it all in perspective.
[01:43:25.355 --> 01:43:34.339]  On the home front, you look at our top trend for 2016, this year, self-sustaining economy.
[01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:37.651]  Make it at home, buy it at home.
[01:43:38.652 --> 01:43:46.178]  So now, going into our trends, as an on-trendpreneur, what would I be selling now?
[01:43:47.679 --> 01:43:50.281]  Made in USA.
[01:43:50.842 --> 01:43:53.023]  Made in America with pride.
[01:43:53.444 --> 01:44:03.412]  And that could be a key selling point that Trump was telling to carriers, like, look, you know, put your air conditioners out there as a made in America product.
[01:44:04.332 --> 01:44:07.433]  Now take that to the entrepreneur level.
[01:44:07.833 --> 01:44:13.754]  Take it to the products that InfoWar is putting in front of its customers.
[01:44:14.054 --> 01:44:17.975]  When I go out, I try to buy organic every time I can.
[01:44:18.615 --> 01:44:23.516]  So I go over to the place and I want to buy, being Italian, I get a lot of garlic, you know?
[01:44:25.476 --> 01:44:28.617]  I see organic garlic from China, from Mexico.
[01:44:29.057 --> 01:44:30.517]  You think I'm going to buy this crap?
[01:44:32.850 --> 01:44:38.674]  So what I'm saying is, Nate, become an entrepreneur.
[01:44:39.035 --> 01:44:44.019]  Start making your shirts, your shoes, everything that you can.
[01:44:44.379 --> 01:44:49.863]  You want to break out of the system and be free and run your life the way you want.
[01:44:50.543 --> 01:44:59.270]  Trump is opening up a door now with a self-sustaining economy like we have not seen since the 1960s.
[01:45:01.909 --> 01:45:02.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:15.424]  I would even go back further and say back to the creation of the Federal Reserve and the income tax where they changed our tax structure and instead of taxing goods and services coming across our borders, they decided they would tax us internally.
[01:45:15.804 --> 01:45:21.531]  It was Jefferson that said he'd eliminated all internal taxation as his second inaugural address.
[01:45:21.931 --> 01:45:23.193]  So he goes, nobody in America
[01:45:23.613 --> 01:45:23.953]  No, no, no.
[01:45:41.583 --> 01:45:45.466]  And again, we're 320 million people.
[01:45:45.486 --> 01:45:49.788]  And we have natural and human resources that match none.
[01:45:50.689 --> 01:45:54.972]  So that's what I'm saying in the sense that we have it all here.
[01:45:54.992 --> 01:45:59.975]  So when you talk about our top trends, I cannot emphasize enough
[01:46:00.635 --> 01:46:03.738]  To start making it in America with pride.
[01:46:04.479 --> 01:46:10.806]  Started doing it in a way, again, one of our trends is true nostalgia.
[01:46:11.307 --> 01:46:13.129]  Here, think of the slogan.
[01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:16.132]  Make America great again.
[01:46:17.494 --> 01:46:17.854]  Again.
[01:46:17.874 --> 01:46:20.837]  So again goes back to the past.
[01:46:21.912 --> 01:46:30.358]  Start recreating the past, but not in the way it was in the past, and start retrofitting it for the future.
[01:46:30.978 --> 01:46:32.820]  So it becomes in style.
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:35.302]  It becomes in entertainment.
[01:46:35.482 --> 01:46:37.183]  And this is very important, David.
[01:46:38.184 --> 01:46:41.566]  Donald Trump didn't just defeat Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:42.727 --> 01:46:44.208]  He defeated Obama.
[01:46:44.932 --> 01:46:45.793]  Yes.
[01:46:46.653 --> 01:46:54.058]  Obama went out, campaigned like we've never seen an elected president in office campaign before.
[01:46:54.538 --> 01:46:55.179]  Absolutely right.
[01:46:55.199 --> 01:46:56.639]  Yeah, we've never seen that before, have we?
[01:46:56.659 --> 01:46:57.300]  Never seen that.
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:57.720]  Yeah.
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:58.701]  He lost.
[01:46:59.361 --> 01:47:00.642]  The rappers lost.
[01:47:03.784 --> 01:47:05.405]  The Beyoncés lost.
[01:47:06.486 --> 01:47:07.606]  Hollywood lost.
[01:47:07.646 --> 01:47:11.329]  The Katzenbergs, the Spielbergs, they hit an iceberg.
[01:47:12.574 --> 01:47:23.246]  Hollywood lost with their $100,000-a-plate dinners to eat a lot of crap to vote for Clinton.
[01:47:23.587 --> 01:47:24.427]  They lost.
[01:47:25.108 --> 01:47:26.350]  De Niro lost.
[01:47:27.605 --> 01:47:28.926]  They all lost.
[01:47:29.747 --> 01:47:30.788]  Clooney lost.
[01:47:31.088 --> 01:47:36.614]  What I'm saying, Silicon Valley lost.
[01:47:37.295 --> 01:47:38.696]  The Zuckerbergs.
[01:47:39.437 --> 01:47:40.298]  The Schmitz.
[01:47:40.578 --> 01:47:41.679]  They lost.
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:43.381]  They lost!
[01:47:44.742 --> 01:47:46.944]  People have to get it in their head.
[01:47:47.645 --> 01:47:50.388]  The biggest ones went down.
[01:47:51.584 --> 01:47:57.178]  They were beaten with a Trump card, and everybody holds that card.
[01:47:57.679 --> 01:47:59.383]  What Trump showed is that
[01:48:00.646 --> 01:48:05.349]  He can do it, you can do it, from somebody outside the system.
[01:48:05.789 --> 01:48:20.940]  What I'm saying is, if Silicon Valley was so strong, if Hollywood was so strong, if the entertainment industry was so strong, if the music industry was so strong, they would have defeated Trump.
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:28.525]  It shows you how weak they are and the opportunities available to fill it with new.
[01:48:29.673 --> 01:48:30.294]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:30.314 --> 01:48:37.363]  And of course it was also the media and it was the establishment of both the Democrats and the Republicans that Trump defeated.
[01:48:37.383 --> 01:48:40.487]  That's why so many of us believe that he doesn't need Mitt Romney.
[01:48:40.527 --> 01:48:41.528]  He can transcend him.
[01:48:41.588 --> 01:48:43.991]  We're going to be talking to Owen Schwerer in the third hour.
[01:48:44.312 --> 01:48:46.194]  He's with the very first
[01:48:46.935 --> 01:48:47.636]  We're good to go.
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:07.561]  Again, this is what I'm saying.
[01:49:07.641 --> 01:49:09.503]  He's in total control.
[01:49:09.983 --> 01:49:11.484]  He'll do what he wants.
[01:49:12.064 --> 01:49:15.026]  Will he do what he says he was going to do?
[01:49:15.547 --> 01:49:17.848]  That could only be decided by him.
[01:49:17.928 --> 01:49:20.090]  Nobody could figure, is going to know.
[01:49:20.370 --> 01:49:29.336]  I'll tell you one thing that I'm surprised that he didn't do, is reach out to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Reagan's former Assistant Treasury Secretary.
[01:49:29.977 --> 01:49:33.199]  There's a guy that I believe he should really have on his team.
[01:49:33.619 --> 01:49:35.220]  Yeah, that would be a great pick.
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:43.143]  Yeah, and if he's going to pick a Supreme Court judge, who's better than Judge Andrew Napolitano?
[01:49:43.163 --> 01:49:43.223]  Yes.
[01:49:43.323 --> 01:49:53.167]  You know, these are the kind of people that would really bring in the wisdom and the outside look from the inside people that would really shake things up.
[01:49:53.567 --> 01:49:57.729]  Yeah, when he was looking at Treasury Secretary, I did a thing on the Monday Night Nightly News.
[01:49:57.789 --> 01:50:02.791]  I talked about John Allison, that he had come by and talked to him.
[01:50:02.891 --> 01:50:07.133]  And I really was not aware of him, even though I knew about BB&T.
[01:50:07.153 --> 01:50:09.114]  We had used them in our business.
[01:50:09.654 --> 01:50:10.715]  We're good to go.
[01:50:31.338 --> 01:50:34.900]  Strictly free-market libertarian on this and anti-Federal Reserve.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:40.382]  That would have been a great pick and I certainly would like to see Judge Napolitano on the Supreme Court.
[01:50:40.442 --> 01:50:41.803]  That would be fantastic.
[01:50:42.263 --> 01:50:44.844]  We've got some more segments coming up with Gerald Slimpty.
[01:50:44.884 --> 01:50:46.845]  We've got to take a quick break and we'll be right back.
[01:51:01.385 --> 01:51:17.013]  Jeff Sessions, a senator who's been on this program, an early Trump supporter, a believer particularly in sealing our borders, in the rule of law, the right man at justice in my opinion.
[01:51:17.393 --> 01:51:22.556]  The right man to proceed against the Clintons with a grand jury proceeded.
[01:51:23.056 --> 01:51:30.241]  I think he's reflective of the kind of men and women that you are going to get out of a Trump administration.
[01:51:31.121 --> 01:51:38.065]  Not men and women who are part of the Washington establishment, not party of the two party duopolies.
[01:51:38.465 --> 01:51:46.530]  Chelsea Clinton has reached out to members of the Trump family in a desperate plea not to have her parents prosecuted.
[01:51:47.290 --> 01:51:49.572]  Unfortunately, it does not work that way.
[01:51:49.632 --> 01:51:53.094]  We are a nation of laws, not a nation of men.
[01:51:53.734 --> 01:52:00.518]  And I think those in the Trump inner circle believe that this is a question that is best left to the grand jury.
[01:52:01.219 --> 01:52:07.502]  This is a question that is left not to politics, but to career prosecutors who can examine all the facts.
[01:52:07.522 --> 01:52:11.485]  There's a lot of alleged crimes here, 30 years of alleged crimes.
[01:52:11.605 --> 01:52:14.667]  As you know, Alex, there's no statute of limitations on treason.
[01:52:15.777 --> 01:52:30.341]  So perhaps selling missile targeting technology to the Chinese in return for campaign contributions, perhaps a special prosecutor should visit that issue and see exactly what happened.
[01:52:31.664 --> 01:52:36.047]  Meanwhile, my friends in Chappaqua tell me that Hillary Clinton is heavily sedated.
[01:52:36.347 --> 01:52:38.568]  We said at the time that her health was not good.
[01:52:38.648 --> 01:52:41.830]  We were told it was a conspiracy theory.
[01:52:42.311 --> 01:52:44.052]  Still don't believe her health is good.
[01:52:44.792 --> 01:52:50.916]  When you see her without the makeup, when you see her without the careful lighting, she does not look well.
[01:52:51.797 --> 01:52:55.159]  I have confirmed, as you did, that she threw a violent fit
[01:52:55.639 --> 01:53:00.884]  When she learned that she was not going to win, she was her usual foul mouth.
[01:53:00.904 --> 01:53:02.105]  She attacked Podesta, right?
[01:53:03.226 --> 01:53:17.800]  Greening obscenities at MOOC and Podesta over what could have been the worst presidential campaign in modern political history, given the billion dollars plus that they had to spend.
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:19.582]  We're good to go.
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:41.242]  There are crimes at the Clinton Foundation, Alex, that are even as yet unreported.
[01:53:41.262 --> 01:53:41.922]  Sure, of course.
[01:53:42.202 --> 01:54:00.088]  But when I look at the work of Charles Nortel, who's one of the most respected guys retired from Wall Street, a true financial expert, someone who has specialized in this area of non-profits, the crimes there that have yet to be reported are extraordinary.
[01:54:01.573 --> 01:54:03.775]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:54:03.795 --> 01:54:07.198]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:11.521 --> 01:54:16.265]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:16.325 --> 01:54:17.886]  I'm David Knight on this December 1st.
[01:54:17.906 --> 01:54:19.147]  We're already into December.
[01:54:19.187 --> 01:54:21.729]  We're about 50 days away from a Trump administration.
[01:54:21.749 --> 01:54:23.651]  We've been talking to Gerald Cilenti.
[01:54:24.389 --> 01:54:26.630]  A trend forecaster, publisher of Trends Journal.
[01:54:26.670 --> 01:54:29.231]  You can find that at TrendsResearch.com.
[01:54:29.851 --> 01:54:36.854]  We've been talking about what Gerald sees in terms of the aftermath of the election, what he sees coming up economically in the next year.
[01:54:36.874 --> 01:54:38.734]  Let's talk about war, Gerald.
[01:54:39.094 --> 01:54:43.096]  We've seen the Russian reset of Hillary Clinton, which turned out to be a reset of the Cold War.
[01:54:43.656 --> 01:54:44.716]  This kind of brinksmanship.
[01:54:44.756 --> 01:54:51.699]  We've seen Obama escalate the policies of George Bush and others in terms of regime change and nation building.
[01:54:52.319 --> 01:54:54.802]  What do you think we're going to have with President Trump?
[01:54:54.842 --> 01:55:06.654]  He's talked about the kind of detente, he hasn't used the word detente, but what he's talking about is an easing and a pulling back from this brinksmanship that we've seen, pulling back from this ridiculous idea of nation building.
[01:55:06.694 --> 01:55:07.695]  What do you see happening?
[01:55:08.931 --> 01:55:17.856]  Again, you know, our system of trend forecasting, we call it global nomic, making connections around the world and between different fields.
[01:55:18.616 --> 01:55:24.940]  So, let's go back to the election that just happened this past Sunday in France with Thelon winning.
[01:55:25.881 --> 01:55:27.762]  One of his major points was,
[01:55:29.025 --> 01:55:31.047]  To make peace with Russia.
[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:48.884]  Have hurt everyone, including the Europeans.
[01:55:48.964 --> 01:55:51.186]  Going back to a self-sustaining economy.
[01:55:51.767 --> 01:55:56.072]  When they put these sanctions on Russia, Russia became more self-sustaining.
[01:55:56.573 --> 01:56:00.417]  So they hurt all the people that were exporting products into Russia.
[01:56:00.878 --> 01:56:04.962]  So you're having it now coming from, as well as, Le Pen in France.
[01:56:05.583 --> 01:56:08.684]  And the same thing going on in Italy.
[01:56:09.284 --> 01:56:10.885]  It's one country after another.
[01:56:10.985 --> 01:56:16.626]  In the Netherlands, they voted against, you know, having more aid for Ukraine.
[01:56:17.407 --> 01:56:21.908]  So, what we're seeing is that people want peace.
[01:56:22.768 --> 01:56:24.829]  And they want it in the United States, too.
[01:56:24.929 --> 01:56:30.711]  Polls come out that they don't run in this country, showing how badly people in America want peace.
[01:56:31.551 --> 01:56:55.329]  So, when you listen to Trump, for example, saying things like, in the Syrian war, brought to you by the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Obama, and Hillary Clinton and Frankenstein-Kerry, that Assad has to go, he said, no, we're not going to give, quote, those rebels, moderate rebels, any more support.
[01:56:55.349 --> 01:56:57.010]  We don't even know who they are.
[01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.591]  That's right.
[01:56:57.611 --> 01:57:00.092]  Which, of course, we've all been saying for years.
[01:57:01.053 --> 01:57:02.474]  That's very positive.
[01:57:03.195 --> 01:57:05.177]  There is no profit in war.
[01:57:05.237 --> 01:57:06.017]  That's a myth.
[01:57:06.738 --> 01:57:10.981]  All it's doing is draining out... It's what Eisenhower said.
[01:57:11.122 --> 01:57:18.267]  Five-star general, not these little boys that play commander-in-chief that couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag.
[01:57:18.768 --> 01:57:22.471]  All they do is play golf, shoot pool, play basketball, and drive pickup trucks.
[01:57:22.851 --> 01:57:27.475]  This is a guy that led, you know, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in World War II.
[01:57:28.516 --> 01:57:42.849]  You know, five-star general is farewell address that the, after being president, two terms, that their military-industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists, sweat of the laborers, and future of the children.
[01:57:43.590 --> 01:57:51.737]  So, now going back to Trump, if he goes on and says, you know, I'm going to build 70 more warships for the Navy, for what?
[01:57:52.659 --> 01:58:00.348]  We're spending more than 11 of the top countries put together on defense.
[01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:04.433]  We're spending about $600 billion when you don't put all the other stuff into it.
[01:58:04.473 --> 01:58:05.455]  It's over a trillion.
[01:58:05.895 --> 01:58:07.197]  And what is Russia spending?
[01:58:07.857 --> 01:58:08.478]  Try $66 billion.
[01:58:11.098 --> 01:58:25.223]  So what I'm saying is, if he redesigns the country into the plans of what we put together as Occupy Peace, no foreign entanglements, close the bases overseas, then we don't need NATO anymore.
[01:58:25.243 --> 01:58:25.923]  I agree.
[01:58:25.963 --> 01:58:28.964]  Hang on, we've got to take a quick break and we're going to be right back on the other side of that.
[01:58:29.004 --> 01:58:29.824]  Yeah, you're right, Gerald.
[01:58:29.864 --> 01:58:34.326]  Nobody wants this except for these Dr. Strangelove creeps and their bunkers.
[01:58:35.206 --> 01:58:35.706]  We don't want it.
[01:58:35.806 --> 01:58:36.747]  The Russian people don't want it.
[01:58:36.767 --> 01:58:37.587]  The Europeans don't want it.
[01:58:37.607 --> 01:58:40.448]  We'll talk more about that on the other side of the break with Gerald Cilenti.
[01:58:41.690 --> 01:58:43.453]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.955 --> 01:58:47.138]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:00.894 --> 01:59:08.826]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:08.886 --> 01:59:11.970]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[01:59:12.796 --> 01:59:14.616]  And they're also very affordable.
[01:59:14.636 --> 01:59:14.956]  Exactly.
[01:59:14.976 --> 01:59:16.757]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[01:59:16.797 --> 01:59:20.118]  You talk about... We're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[01:59:20.158 --> 01:59:21.438]  We've both talked to them.
[01:59:21.618 --> 01:59:30.580]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:31.140]  Okay?
[01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:32.560]  We refuse to screw people.
[01:59:32.900 --> 01:59:33.880]  We refuse to do that.
[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:36.221]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[01:59:36.781 --> 01:59:43.525]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[01:59:43.906 --> 01:59:44.666]  It's a win-win.
[01:59:45.166 --> 01:59:46.207]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:52.971 --> 01:59:55.633]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.361 --> 02:00:17.465]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:18.025 --> 02:00:20.347]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.487 --> 02:00:26.612]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:26.732 --> 02:00:29.714]  I'm David Knight, and this is our final segment with Gerald Cilenti.
[02:00:30.347 --> 02:00:39.298]  In the next segment, we're going to have a special report from Alex Jones, talking about the latest attack on him from mainstream media, Anderson Cooper, and his response to that.
[02:00:39.338 --> 02:00:45.826]  And then at the bottom of the hour, we're going to have Owen Schroyer, who is following, actually, he's at the very first Victory Tour.
[02:00:46.947 --> 02:00:47.668]  I guess, what do you call them?
[02:00:47.688 --> 02:00:49.591]  They're not concerts, but it's a rally.
[02:00:50.271 --> 02:00:51.192]  I guess it could be a concert.
[02:00:51.212 --> 02:01:04.565]  They don't have Beyonce, fortunately, performing there, but it's the first victory rally that Donald Trump is doing, and that's a very different approach that Donald Trump is taking to what all the other politicians have done.
[02:01:04.825 --> 02:01:08.749]  I want to go back to Warren and give Gerald Cilenti the final comment on this.
[02:01:10.169 --> 02:01:25.951]  I've seen a lot of signs that it's not just the people that you mentioned in Europe who are very interested in pulling back from this brink, pulling back from the sanctions and the increase in tensions that we've seen under Obama and under Hillary, but also the Russian people themselves.
[02:01:26.351 --> 02:01:32.835]  There was an article I reported on a couple of times about how this one town wants to rename a street there that is called Godless Street.
[02:01:32.875 --> 02:01:36.597]  That was what the Godless atheists named the streets there to promote that.
[02:01:36.777 --> 02:01:40.200]  It's called Godless Street and they want to rename it from Godless to Donald Trump.
[02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:48.024]  They got a petition going there because they realize that they've had a loaded gun pointed at their head by Obama and Hillary and they're hoping it's going to be a new day.
[02:01:48.124 --> 02:01:50.406]  Are you hopeful that that's going to be the case with Donald Trump?
[02:01:51.107 --> 02:01:55.370]  Yes, I think it's going to be, particularly with Russia, and he's made it clear with that.
[02:01:55.891 --> 02:02:07.500]  And again, going back though, if he's going to spend all this money on a military, you know, again, I was a keynote speaker at VMI, Virginia Military Institute, on New Millennium Warfare.
[02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:12.123]  And, you know, there's a saying that generals are always fighting the last war.
[02:02:13.104 --> 02:02:15.185]  And the Navy is the last war.
[02:02:15.746 --> 02:02:18.167]  We're looking at hypersonic missiles now.
[02:02:18.187 --> 02:02:18.868]  That's right.
[02:02:18.888 --> 02:02:21.929]  We're looking at a whole different method of warfare.
[02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:30.034]  Look at that piece of garbage, that $4 billion Zumwalt ship that they just had to tow out of the Panama Canal.
[02:02:30.274 --> 02:02:33.356]  That's right, it only had one engine, and when that broke down, they had to tow it back.
[02:02:33.376 --> 02:02:34.817]  Yeah.
[02:02:35.678 --> 02:02:41.141]  I mean, the aircraft carriers, the Navy is truly sitting ducks.
[02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:47.798]  So again, we need to really put where are our priorities.
[02:02:48.399 --> 02:02:52.765]  And to me, the priority is to really rebuild America.
[02:02:53.692 --> 02:03:04.799]  And the way you do it is by investing not a trillion dollars over 10 years in infrastructure, but really making it happen big time in many different areas.
[02:03:05.299 --> 02:03:07.600]  So the opportunity is there.
[02:03:08.121 --> 02:03:09.281]  Where will he go with it?
[02:03:09.481 --> 02:03:10.142]  I don't know.
[02:03:10.442 --> 02:03:13.044]  But again, the warning signs are flashing.
[02:03:13.344 --> 02:03:15.205]  You know, here's something that just came out.
[02:03:15.685 --> 02:03:18.086]  It doesn't make it in the prestitute media.
[02:03:18.207 --> 02:03:21.729]  Erdogan, the head of Turkey over there.
[02:03:22.694 --> 02:03:31.949]  He said, quote, we entered Syria to enter the rule of the tyrant Al-Assad, who terrorizes with state terror.
[02:03:33.131 --> 02:03:34.894]  You invaded another country.
[02:03:35.506 --> 02:03:35.746]  Yes.
[02:03:35.946 --> 02:03:37.167]  You don't like the guy?
[02:03:37.487 --> 02:03:38.628]  What did he do to you?
[02:03:39.108 --> 02:03:41.049]  What's the United States doing there?
[02:03:41.530 --> 02:03:42.930]  What's France doing there?
[02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:43.751]  And the UK?
[02:03:44.191 --> 02:03:54.337]  What I'm saying is we still have those neocons out there in the United States who are psychopaths and love murder.
[02:03:54.877 --> 02:03:55.017]  Yes.
[02:03:55.037 --> 02:03:59.240]  So that's what Trump is going to be up against, plus people like Erdogan.
[02:03:59.775 --> 02:04:00.355]  Yes, yes.
[02:04:00.435 --> 02:04:01.836]  And Alex talked about that yesterday.
[02:04:01.876 --> 02:04:06.239]  He said that's essentially a declaration of war to say, we entered your country to overthrow you.
[02:04:06.259 --> 02:04:08.040]  And we know that's what's been happening.
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:11.842]  We know that was the plan of Hillary, just as they did in Libya.
[02:04:11.862 --> 02:04:13.743]  And look at Libya after Gaddafi.
[02:04:14.223 --> 02:04:21.007]  He's not a good guy, but look at how much worse that made the entire Middle East situation, setting it on fire, creating ISIS.
[02:04:21.287 --> 02:04:24.829]  And we've pointed out, you've pointed out for the last several years,
[02:04:25.269 --> 02:04:32.232]  How they not only created ISIS, but they train them, they fund them, they continually give them more weapons, and so hopefully that's going to change.
[02:04:32.332 --> 02:04:35.133]  I share your concern about a defense buildup.
[02:04:35.253 --> 02:04:39.395]  I'm even concerned about the federal government being involved in building up the infrastructure.
[02:04:39.435 --> 02:04:45.097]  My greatest hope for the Trump administration is that they would cut taxes even bigger than Ronald Reagan did.
[02:04:45.157 --> 02:04:50.059]  We know what a benefit that would have to get government out of the way so we can run our own lives.
[02:04:50.379 --> 02:04:52.039]  Always great to hear from you, Gerald Salenti.
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:53.320]  Thank you so much again.
[02:04:53.380 --> 02:04:57.141]  If you want to find Trends Journal, the website is TrendsResearch.com.
[02:04:57.161 --> 02:04:57.961]  Thank you so much, Gerald.
[02:04:58.581 --> 02:04:59.181]  Thank you, David.
[02:04:59.501 --> 02:05:08.884]  And we're going to be right back with a special report from... I mean, it's bad, folks.
[02:05:08.984 --> 02:05:12.945]  I had a guy brandish a gun at a restaurant Saturday morning.
[02:05:14.208 --> 02:05:18.691]  Before that, someone came over and said it's on video, we were doing a live stream, and said, F you Alex Jones.
[02:05:19.212 --> 02:05:21.193]  They are flipping out.
[02:05:21.253 --> 02:05:22.814]  Ward-Monton, what do you make of this?
[02:05:22.834 --> 02:05:26.097]  I mean, do you agree with what I'm saying, or where do you see this going?
[02:05:26.197 --> 02:05:29.559]  I think this is very, very typical of the left now.
[02:05:29.819 --> 02:05:33.041]  They are not, in any real sense, Democrats.
[02:05:33.122 --> 02:05:40.467]  They don't believe in the popular vote, unless by their power in the media they can manipulate it, and of course by massive voter fraud.
[02:05:40.567 --> 02:05:43.529]  Even that wasn't big enough to get it for them this time.
[02:05:43.809 --> 02:05:45.069]  And of course they're furious.
[02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:47.430]  And what should we do about this?
[02:05:47.470 --> 02:06:02.354]  What we've got to do is to make it clear to them that they either shape up and sharpen up and get back with democracy and start understanding that the will of the people in a republic that is democratic is sovereign.
[02:06:03.215 --> 02:06:08.080]  Or they can get out of politics altogether and go and grow vegetable marrows.
[02:06:08.740 --> 02:06:12.844]  They can't pretend that they like democracy when they don't.
[02:06:13.165 --> 02:06:24.797]  And one of the reasons why they lost is that people are beginning to realise that the left hate democracy because every so often, as it has this time, it allows somebody else a turn at the levers of government.
[02:06:25.177 --> 02:06:29.041]  They want to go full authoritarian, which tells me everything.
[02:06:29.062 --> 02:06:39.333]  But it also shows one thing from which you should take both comfort and pride, Alex, and that is that you did make a material difference to the vote.
[02:06:40.254 --> 02:06:44.255]  You're speaking out in favour of freedom, OK.
[02:06:44.655 --> 02:06:48.316]  As you know, I tease you from time to time because you go over the top.
[02:06:48.836 --> 02:06:53.657]  But given the pressure under which we on the centre-right are being put, one forgives you that.
[02:06:53.957 --> 02:07:06.179]  But you and those like you, like Matt Drudge and so forth, and like Steve Bannon, of course, and Breitbart, who had the courage to buck the trend of universal Marxism in the media,
[02:07:06.979 --> 02:07:14.626]  And instead to give an alternative view, which won't necessarily always be congenial to China.
[02:07:14.986 --> 02:07:17.728]  Well, that's what freedom is all about.
[02:07:18.108 --> 02:07:33.221]  And because of you, Alex Jones, and because of InfoWars and Prison Planet, because of these enterprises of freedom that you have set up as a voice of freedom, it is because of this voice of freedom that freedom has found itself again
[02:07:33.681 --> 02:07:35.482]  And that's why Trump got elected.
[02:07:35.662 --> 02:07:39.945]  So don't feel upset that they attacked you.
[02:07:40.285 --> 02:07:48.530]  That, when they attack you, then they're paying you the compliment of saying it was you that helped to put Trump where he is.
[02:07:48.750 --> 02:07:56.455]  And you can bet that Steve Bannon knows this, that Trump knows this, that people like Myron Ebel, the team he's gathering around him, they know this.
[02:08:17.543 --> 02:08:21.447]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:26.071 --> 02:08:40.785]  As all of you know, President Obama, the lame duck that'll be out of office in 50 days, has been traveling around the world, Europe, Latin America, North America, bad-mouthing all the fake news.
[02:08:41.866 --> 02:08:55.272]  Well, there's an article from Truth Revolt up on Infowars.com that has large excerpts of a fluff piece done by the dying publication Rolling Stone that, by the way, Infowars is about 50 times bigger than.
[02:08:55.553 --> 02:09:02.176]  Not bragging, it's just important to rub the dead dinosaur's noses in the mud because these are the fake news deceivers.
[02:09:02.956 --> 02:09:04.177]  But they go beyond fake news.
[02:09:05.257 --> 02:09:08.780]  In this Rolling Stone interview, he goes further than ever before.
[02:09:09.441 --> 02:09:21.191]  We've played the clips of his speeches in Greece and his speeches in Germany and his speeches all over the world the last two weeks, last three weeks, since they were defeated in the general election.
[02:09:22.272 --> 02:09:27.497]  And in those speeches, he says, we need strong centralized media to counter the fake media.
[02:09:27.517 --> 02:09:30.539]  We need to have ways to control and shut down the fake media.
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:42.237]  Well, in the new piece that's up on Infowars.com, he tells Rolling Stone that he wants state backing and funding to prop up the media.
[02:09:42.257 --> 02:09:43.199]  You can go read it for yourself.
[02:09:43.940 --> 02:09:45.823]  So this is just the next level, like the BBC.
[02:09:47.372 --> 02:09:52.295]  That InfoWars.com is bigger than, according to Quantcast and much other services, just thought I'd add that.
[02:09:52.315 --> 02:09:52.956]  Rub their noses in it.
[02:09:53.136 --> 02:09:55.878]  These are pathetic jokes.
[02:09:55.898 --> 02:09:58.860]  3.7 billion pounds a year spent at the BBC.
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:03.623]  They admit almost their whole mission is just online, BBC.com and InfoWars.
[02:10:03.643 --> 02:10:05.325]  Only one small part of what we do is bigger than them.
[02:10:05.365 --> 02:10:07.066]  But this is not about a brag fest.
[02:10:08.558 --> 02:10:10.140]  It's about understanding why they're doing this.
[02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:14.667]  We're killing them, and so now they're going to the states saying, shut down our competition.
[02:10:14.687 --> 02:10:23.759]  I always talked about this perfect storm, that if we were able to focus and take action, and put the truth out about the New World Order, and how they were establishing a corporate world government,
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:28.202]  And defeat their whole stonewall operation, like they do on everything.
[02:10:28.262 --> 02:10:29.903]  Oh, we don't want your guns, but they do.
[02:10:30.263 --> 02:10:31.824]  Oh, Obamacare is free, but it isn't.
[02:10:33.125 --> 02:10:35.726]  Oh, there's no IRS penalties, but there is.
[02:10:36.567 --> 02:10:41.390]  If we ever break them of their stonewalling, then all the confidence disappears.
[02:10:42.170 --> 02:10:52.755]  Their strategy was an all or nothing, but when you hit that point of their collapse, they're going to then go for governmental censorship of real independent media.
[02:10:52.855 --> 02:10:56.677]  Doesn't matter whether it's left-wing, right-wing, anti-war, pro-war, it doesn't matter.
[02:10:57.057 --> 02:11:06.282]  They want centralized control, and the big issue is, whether it's the Pope or the Communist Chinese or the Saudi Arabians or the EU, the perfect storm is here.
[02:11:06.322 --> 02:11:07.823]  We're collapsing corrupt governments.
[02:11:08.884 --> 02:11:12.355]  And collapsing dinosaur media pretty much already state run.
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:22.903]  He's now openly preparing to fuse with government and the UN, as the Soros email showed, via DCLeaks and Wikileaks, and try to censor us and shut us down.
[02:11:23.424 --> 02:11:37.469]  And to do that, they're going to go to new levels of fake media and say and do things that are completely, 100% untrue, in a desperate attempt to get their flagging minion audience to support what they're doing.
[02:11:37.949 --> 02:11:40.750]  The problem is we have a Bill of Rights and Constitution in due process.
[02:11:41.650 --> 02:11:44.433]  And so good luck for you actually trying to totally censor us.
[02:11:44.993 --> 02:11:55.482]  Though they're going to delist our apps, though they're going to try to put filter systems on us, though they're going to lie about us, though they're going to try to block us out in Europe, they still will not be successful.
[02:11:55.562 --> 02:11:59.526]  Especially if we point out what's happening while it's happening to the public.
[02:11:59.926 --> 02:12:06.011]  Because if we actually fight back, resistance is victory, it'll build our political muscles and our free speech muscles.
[02:12:06.912 --> 02:12:12.836]  Like the example of the EU's trying to ban, and France is trying to ban, pro-life information online.
[02:12:12.856 --> 02:12:14.938]  I mean, that's just outrageous, folks.
[02:12:15.698 --> 02:12:17.560]  But again, the answer is resist it.
[02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:20.241]  Everybody who's pro-life, start posting information.
[02:12:20.622 --> 02:12:21.682]  Start doing it globally.
[02:12:22.163 --> 02:12:27.867]  Because just as they attack us on a global scale, people that want freedom worldwide, we're also fighting on a global scale.
[02:12:28.387 --> 02:12:29.988]  Americans helped fight for Brexit.
[02:12:30.729 --> 02:12:32.750]  Folks that were part of Brexit helped fight for Trump.
[02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:34.752]  Vice versa, we're going to help fight for
[02:12:36.877 --> 02:12:37.377]  Le Pen.
[02:12:38.478 --> 02:12:40.239]  We're going to help fight for the folks in Catalonia.
[02:12:40.339 --> 02:12:43.060]  We're going to help fight for the Russians to stay out of the New World Order.
[02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:48.423]  This is a global, nationalistic awakening, what I call 1776 Worldwide.
[02:12:48.463 --> 02:12:58.289]  But it is truly, truly... The reason I get so excited about all this, and start even getting shortness of breath, is it's so epic.
[02:12:59.389 --> 02:13:00.230]  It's so historical.
[02:13:00.831 --> 02:13:03.955]  Do you understand we have the political information that's real?
[02:13:04.716 --> 02:13:06.297]  We have the enemy battle plans.
[02:13:06.898 --> 02:13:17.251]  They've created a completely synthetic, false cultural, economic, and political system that's designed to not work and designed to disempower people.
[02:13:19.025 --> 02:13:24.431]  The system we are promoting, the American system, that I keep saying was the apple of the world's eye.
[02:13:25.011 --> 02:13:27.294]  I have thousands of articles I could be covering right now.
[02:13:27.774 --> 02:13:29.496]  But why am I going back to something I keep hammering?
[02:13:30.177 --> 02:13:31.758]  Because this is the central fight.
[02:13:32.159 --> 02:13:33.380]  We expose globalism.
[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:34.861]  We expose it's unelected.
[02:13:35.162 --> 02:13:36.443]  We expose it's illegitimate.
[02:13:36.964 --> 02:13:38.746]  It's going to fall.
[02:13:41.192 --> 02:13:48.154]  Before it completely falls, it will try to shut us down in a desperate attempt to keep itself in power.
[02:13:48.694 --> 02:13:50.255]  And we're now reaching that point.
[02:13:51.335 --> 02:13:56.636]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win, as Mahatma Gandhi said.
[02:13:57.517 --> 02:14:00.697]  And regardless of what you thought about Gandhi, he was dead right when it came to that.
[02:14:01.198 --> 02:14:05.939]  Self-determination and the free will driving it is basically unstoppable.
[02:14:07.208 --> 02:14:08.828]  So we've now reached the vortex point.
[02:14:08.848 --> 02:14:10.449]  We've now reached the critical juncture.
[02:14:10.749 --> 02:14:23.092]  The point of return where we have the President of the United States openly coming out and saying, censor the alternative media, the new media, and have propped up state-run media.
[02:14:23.632 --> 02:14:32.414]  And to watch the sycophantic mainstream media lapdogs perch in his lap and just sit there fawningly loving him is the most pathetic thing in the world.
[02:14:33.661 --> 02:14:41.364]  And that's all the globalists have left is state-run media and control, and then of course staging events or hyping events to demonize their opposition.
[02:14:41.384 --> 02:14:41.745]  That's it.
[02:14:42.445 --> 02:14:50.828]  That's why Anderson Cooper last night, and again there's so many of these pieces I can't even keep track of them, but what I should announce here is this.
[02:14:51.449 --> 02:15:00.893]  Infowars.com and Stephen Bannon of Breitbart are the most attacked, of course along with Drudge, just perpetually.
[02:15:02.122 --> 02:15:04.524]  Are the most attacked organizations out there.
[02:15:05.005 --> 02:15:06.967]  It's not Rush Limbaugh anymore, it's not any of that.
[02:15:07.007 --> 02:15:12.472]  Nothing against Rush, but he's talking to a very old audience of great folks, but that's all moving on.
[02:15:13.333 --> 02:15:23.443]  The future, what's currently happening, the real intellectual war, where we're gaining ground is DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com, Breitbart.com, and the direction Bannon's taking Breitbart.
[02:15:23.823 --> 02:15:26.205]  Even more hardcore, more anti-globalists.
[02:15:27.026 --> 02:15:33.330]  More so than just anti-liberal, because liberalism, modern liberalism is only a small factor in that, a subset of its control arm.
[02:15:33.571 --> 02:15:34.291]  They're fake liberals.
[02:15:35.532 --> 02:15:38.154]  And it's this paradigm shift that will overthrow them.
[02:15:38.254 --> 02:15:42.256]  They've got to keep us in a fake, false system, because...
[02:15:43.477 --> 02:15:46.360]  That will keep people basically in a box and won't be able to get out of it.
[02:15:46.821 --> 02:15:50.144]  The minute you see the full system, it's game over, it's over.
[02:15:50.824 --> 02:15:56.310]  So again, we are on the verge of moves that will bring us to victory against this system.
[02:15:56.870 --> 02:16:07.240]  We'll still have problems, obviously, there's no perfect system, but true free market, compared to crony capitalism, using socialism and communism as control arms, there's no comparison.
[02:16:08.021 --> 02:16:22.407]  So, I'm going to play a clip coming up here with Cooper breathlessly, five times in one minute, saying, will you denounce Infowars to one of the Trump surrogates, one of the Trump administration people.
[02:16:23.107 --> 02:16:24.948]  And, of course, the guy won't disavow.
[02:16:24.988 --> 02:16:28.129]  But I want to explain something in closing to mainstream media.
[02:16:28.149 --> 02:16:31.611]  I want you to listen very, very carefully, because you are the fake media.
[02:16:32.051 --> 02:16:33.791]  You follow talking points and teleprompters.
[02:16:33.811 --> 02:16:36.913]  But I want you and your bosses to understand something, dumbasses.
[02:16:38.126 --> 02:16:49.696]  It's very clear, there was a Washington Post article about this yesterday, saying that Breitbart and Infowars could end up being Trump's biggest enemies.
[02:16:50.336 --> 02:17:03.167]  And it says in there, when Trump doesn't 100% deliver, which is impossible to do, that we're all going to turn on him and that they can't wait until that happens and that they're going to prod us and manipulate us into that.
[02:17:03.527 --> 02:17:06.790]  Hey guys, I could see that was your tactic months ago.
[02:17:08.038 --> 02:17:08.879]  I'm not stupid.
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:19.770]  As long as he tries to get things done, and get some things done, or dies trying, I'm gonna support Trump 110% because he's not a globalist out to get the country, and nobody's perfect.
[02:17:20.651 --> 02:17:25.115]  And so, but you tell everybody what you're really up to in that article, which I keep telling the listeners.
[02:17:25.896 --> 02:17:27.357]  We brought Trump to where he is.
[02:17:28.573 --> 02:17:34.242]  Infowars is the heart of the liberty, anti-globalist, populist awakening.
[02:17:34.843 --> 02:17:38.389]  So we don't need to be thanked or even recognized.
[02:17:39.468 --> 02:17:42.372]  That's all just some issue of ego.
[02:17:42.892 --> 02:17:43.833]  We are the movement.
[02:17:43.894 --> 02:17:44.755]  You are the movement.
[02:17:44.815 --> 02:17:45.476]  We're winning.
[02:17:46.176 --> 02:17:50.542]  So if Trump was to come out and denounce us, he would be denouncing himself.
[02:17:51.103 --> 02:17:52.524]  He would be giving the media power.
[02:17:52.544 --> 02:17:57.911]  He would be letting them set the parameters and set the systems of debate.
[02:17:58.852 --> 02:17:59.812]  That's what they're all about.
[02:18:00.092 --> 02:18:03.113]  Labeling, names, political correctness, controlling paradigms.
[02:18:03.693 --> 02:18:07.854]  You give them that, you lose control of everything, and Trump understands that.
[02:18:07.894 --> 02:18:14.975]  But we're not the average little dumbed-down morons like their followers are, where you talk to us like we're three years old.
[02:18:14.995 --> 02:18:16.175]  Do you understand?
[02:18:16.195 --> 02:18:18.915]  We're going to continue our movement regardless of what Trump does.
[02:18:19.235 --> 02:18:21.876]  We're going to continue to expose how illegitimate the new world order is.
[02:18:22.316 --> 02:18:27.737]  And whether Trump delivers or doesn't deliver is quite frankly a non-issue because we're going to continue marching on.
[02:18:28.860 --> 02:18:29.721]  So understand that.
[02:18:30.562 --> 02:18:31.523]  We're sophisticated.
[02:18:32.124 --> 02:18:39.373]  We understood we were promoting ideas and systems well documented to work and well documented to create incredible freedom and choice.
[02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:40.710]  You understand?
[02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:42.671]  So we're promoting the Renaissance.
[02:18:42.971 --> 02:18:57.535]  We're promoting hardcore Americanism and nationalism, and we don't care what a bunch of globalists and corporations that have hijacked our country say or do about us, because we know it's nothing but political weapons you've got aimed at us, and it's totally cold-blooded and illegitimate.
[02:18:58.196 --> 02:18:59.236]  We are passionate.
[02:18:59.296 --> 02:19:00.116]  We do care.
[02:19:00.376 --> 02:19:01.997]  We do wear our emotions on our sleeves.
[02:19:02.377 --> 02:19:05.358]  But our analysis is cold and hard and understands who
[02:19:05.538 --> 02:19:06.078]  I don't know.
[02:19:17.816 --> 02:19:36.447]  So that's the key to understand here, is that he's got this Trump operative on trying to get him to denounce me and twisting things I've said in some hope to take control of the narrative and to be the guy on the high hill, you know, dictating to everyone else down below who they can talk to, who they can be with, who can support them.
[02:19:37.067 --> 02:19:46.033]  They're trying to cut the anti-globalism movement out of the Trump presidency by going after Breitbart and by going after Infowars, and it's not working.
[02:19:46.733 --> 02:19:47.974]  Do you understand that?
[02:19:48.514 --> 02:19:50.515]  Do you have that through your stupid head?
[02:19:51.116 --> 02:19:55.458]  We don't need to be legitimized by Trump saying we're legitimate.
[02:19:55.819 --> 02:19:58.560]  We don't need to be legitimized by you saying we're legitimate.
[02:19:59.121 --> 02:20:07.265]  When CNN says we're not legitimate, that is a giant chevron or gold star on us for everyone to see that we are legitimate.
[02:20:08.306 --> 02:20:12.391]  And again, it is your final arrogance, not understanding that, that is bringing you down.
[02:20:13.172 --> 02:20:15.796]  I don't like to see him so hysterical, though, and so fearful.
[02:20:15.856 --> 02:20:19.280]  It means he might lose his hubris, and they might come up with a new plan.
[02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:21.202]  Then we'll have to reassess that.
[02:20:21.242 --> 02:20:25.347]  But it's good to see that they're still completely arrogant.
[02:20:25.928 --> 02:20:33.312]  And I just hope that arrogance doesn't falter or doesn't waver because that blindness, that hubris is absolutely essential to defeating these enemies.
[02:20:33.952 --> 02:20:42.436]  So let's go ahead and play this clip and then go back to the live transmission here with David Knight, Paul Watson coming up and so much more on this live worldwide Thursday edition.
[02:20:42.496 --> 02:20:44.697]  But huge things are happening.
[02:20:45.097 --> 02:20:46.578]  We have the ideology of truth.
[02:20:46.958 --> 02:20:48.379]  We have the ideology of history.
[02:20:48.619 --> 02:20:50.020]  We have the ideology of facts.
[02:20:50.140 --> 02:20:51.661]  It is incontrovertible.
[02:20:52.421 --> 02:20:54.422]  That history has shown this over and over again.
[02:20:54.542 --> 02:21:00.244]  All we're doing is bringing common sense and salt and light back into the world, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:00.544 --> 02:21:02.524]  And it's so simple what we're promoting.
[02:21:02.624 --> 02:21:03.985]  It's the winning ideology.
[02:21:04.525 --> 02:21:08.346]  It's the ideology that God empowered this nation to promote.
[02:21:08.726 --> 02:21:14.548]  It is the ideology that has given us the amazing providence that we've had and the enemy is screaming
[02:21:14.548 --> 02:21:14.928]  I don't know.
[02:21:30.723 --> 02:21:48.576]  Because it is nothing but violent death rows of the most traitorous, anti-human, narcissistic, sociopathic, psychopathic, mercenary legions of filth that have absolute bad will towards the American people and every single one of you, regardless of what color you are.
[02:21:48.836 --> 02:21:51.818]  So have that righteous, righteous indignation.
[02:21:51.858 --> 02:21:53.439]  Have that true focus.
[02:21:53.459 --> 02:21:54.000]  Not hatred.
[02:21:54.480 --> 02:22:00.302]  But the cold, hard, strong will in your chest to know we're going to run these people over politically.
[02:22:00.482 --> 02:22:01.683]  We're going to dominate them.
[02:22:01.923 --> 02:22:03.163]  We're going to smash them.
[02:22:03.183 --> 02:22:04.484]  We're going to crush them.
[02:22:04.964 --> 02:22:13.788]  Nothing's going to stop us because we are standing for what's right and God cannot be stopped when his people take action and do it in his name, Jesus Christ.
[02:22:14.028 --> 02:22:18.249]  But this is a huge war and we're turning the tide and see how far we've come.
[02:22:18.729 --> 02:22:19.830]  I've always known this.
[02:22:19.890 --> 02:22:21.090]  I've always understood this.
[02:22:21.150 --> 02:22:22.651]  I've always told you we're here to
[02:22:22.771 --> 02:22:23.151]  We're here to win.
[02:22:23.411 --> 02:22:24.732]  We're here to take the planet back.
[02:22:24.972 --> 02:22:26.312]  We're here to defeat these people.
[02:22:26.633 --> 02:22:30.434]  And no amount of state-run churches and propaganda is going to stop that.
[02:22:30.634 --> 02:22:32.595]  And that's why these cowards hate us so much.
[02:22:32.855 --> 02:22:35.916]  Because they know we're the rightful heirs of Providence.
[02:22:36.136 --> 02:22:39.217]  And they can't stand it because they're a barrel of snakes.
[02:22:39.457 --> 02:22:40.778]  Just look at Anderson Cooper.
[02:22:41.398 --> 02:22:43.320]  Just, just look at Charlie Rose.
[02:22:43.780 --> 02:22:45.522]  Just look at Janet Reno.
[02:22:45.782 --> 02:22:47.264]  Just look at Madeleine Albright.
[02:22:47.284 --> 02:22:48.465]  Just look at Obama.
[02:22:48.705 --> 02:22:50.046]  Just look at Michael Moore.
[02:22:50.266 --> 02:22:51.107]  Just look at these.
[02:22:51.167 --> 02:22:53.269]  That's what they do, what they stand for.
[02:22:54.090 --> 02:22:56.232]  Simpering, weasel-like snakes.
[02:22:56.872 --> 02:23:00.476]  Absolute abominations and monsters and everything they're involved in.
[02:23:00.696 --> 02:23:02.918]  And all the horrible things they do behind the scenes.
[02:23:03.138 --> 02:23:07.282]  These are truly demonic people who are now falling in front of us all.
[02:23:17.415 --> 02:23:23.297]  This man who's going to be President of the United States, going, you know, following Infowars, talking about... Right, right.
[02:23:23.517 --> 02:23:24.078]  I don't know anything.
[02:23:24.098 --> 02:23:24.978]  It was an inside job.
[02:23:25.018 --> 02:23:25.398]  Right, right.
[02:23:25.418 --> 02:23:26.879]  I don't know anything about Infowars.
[02:23:26.939 --> 02:23:27.839]  What I do know is this.
[02:23:28.679 --> 02:23:34.942]  In 2014, John Fund, whom many of us know here, formerly with the Wall Street Journal and now with National Review Online,
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:37.240]  That doesn't say those people actually voted.
[02:24:02.526 --> 02:24:05.028]  Well, no, but they shouldn't be on registration rolls, right?
[02:24:05.068 --> 02:24:06.590]  There's dead people on registration rolls.
[02:24:06.610 --> 02:24:08.531]  We know registration rolls have lots of problems.
[02:24:08.551 --> 02:24:10.153]  They shouldn't be there, period.
[02:24:10.873 --> 02:24:13.876]  Again, there's no evidence 3 million people voted illegally.
[02:24:14.356 --> 02:24:16.719]  I understand that, but the answer is we don't know.
[02:24:17.019 --> 02:24:18.160]  We don't know, clearly.
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:18.760]  We don't know.
[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:21.363]  But does it scare you that the President-elect is listening to InfoWars?
[02:24:21.863 --> 02:24:22.063]  Right.
[02:24:22.444 --> 02:24:26.287]  No, I think you answer, you listen to all kinds of people all over the place here.
[02:24:26.307 --> 02:24:32.633]  Look, Ronald Reagan got pinned for, you know, having friends who were members of the John Birch Society, for heaven's sakes.
[02:24:33.795 --> 02:24:36.337]  They believe 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:24:36.377 --> 02:24:37.558]  Right, right, of course.
[02:24:37.598 --> 02:24:40.261]  They believe all Sandy Hook is all crisis actors.
[02:24:40.421 --> 02:24:45.283]  People I've interviewed, their followers terrorize the families of these people.
[02:24:45.463 --> 02:24:47.324]  I am not here to vouch for InfoWars.
[02:24:47.444 --> 02:24:48.685]  I don't listen to InfoWars.
[02:24:49.485 --> 02:24:50.926]  But the President-elect seems to.
[02:24:51.166 --> 02:24:51.706]  Right, right.
[02:24:53.847 --> 02:24:54.607]  There you go.
[02:24:54.667 --> 02:25:00.350]  That's the kind of McCarthyism of the left there from Anderson Cooper.
[02:25:01.090 --> 02:25:03.611]  Yeah, we shouldn't question the idea that
[02:25:05.091 --> 02:25:08.773]  Three buildings would fall down after being, after two of them were hit by a single plane.
[02:25:08.793 --> 02:25:09.793]  What about that third building?
[02:25:09.813 --> 02:25:10.493]  What about Building 7?
[02:25:10.553 --> 02:25:12.574]  You know, there's an article on the Free Thought Project.
[02:25:12.594 --> 02:25:16.116]  Former NIST employee speaks out saying Building 7 investigation is bogus.
[02:25:17.213 --> 02:25:17.433]  Yeah.
[02:25:18.074 --> 02:25:19.775]  But that's what they keep hammering that with.
[02:25:19.795 --> 02:25:23.237]  You know, they believe that the government's story on 9-11 isn't true.
[02:25:23.277 --> 02:25:23.497]  Yeah.
[02:25:23.878 --> 02:25:24.358]  Yeah, we don't.
[02:25:24.378 --> 02:25:27.220]  And you know, Donald Trump wasn't fooled by that either.
[02:25:27.260 --> 02:25:31.203]  We've played over and over again the clip as it happened.
[02:25:31.243 --> 02:25:33.084]  It was either the same day or the day after.
[02:25:33.124 --> 02:25:33.765]  And they asked him about it.
[02:25:33.785 --> 02:25:35.246]  He goes, you know, that's a very strong building.
[02:25:36.106 --> 02:25:39.028]  And he knows as a builder we've never had before or since.
[02:25:40.074 --> 02:25:46.119]  Any skyscrapers, steel skyscrapers that just fell down in their own footprint without being demolished.
[02:25:46.159 --> 02:25:47.741]  He says planes aren't going to knock those down.
[02:25:47.781 --> 02:25:53.846]  They were designed to withstand a plane impact after a plane hit the Empire State Building.
[02:25:53.906 --> 02:25:54.446]  That's part of it.
[02:25:54.466 --> 02:25:58.590]  You've never seen anybody sue the state of or the city of New York.
[02:25:59.230 --> 02:26:01.271]  Because they didn't inspect that building properly.
[02:26:01.291 --> 02:26:03.452]  Nobody ever sued the architects for that.
[02:26:03.592 --> 02:26:06.313]  And then you had a building that wasn't even hit by a plane that fell down.
[02:26:06.333 --> 02:26:10.474]  But, you know, if you think there's something strange about that, you're kind of crazy, aren't you?
[02:26:11.255 --> 02:26:19.858]  And, of course, as we've seen this metastasize, as I pointed out earlier today, we now have Bloomberg joining CNN and Hillary and the DNC and Podesta.
[02:26:19.878 --> 02:26:22.959]  All of them are saying, you know, the Russians are behind all this stuff.
[02:26:23.946 --> 02:26:25.127]  Jill Stein is saying that as well.
[02:26:25.387 --> 02:26:29.371]  So now Bloomberg is saying social media has been weaponized by Russia.
[02:26:29.411 --> 02:26:30.432]  It's always the Russians, right?
[02:26:30.752 --> 02:26:34.595]  Joined by another failed cybersecurity company, FireEye.
[02:26:35.176 --> 02:26:36.237]  But here's the scary thing.
[02:26:37.014 --> 02:26:50.083]  Yesterday, we had the House pass an intelligence bill that was going to thwart this imaginary Russian influence over social media and the people, and push back against this idea that there's fake information being put out there by the Russians.
[02:26:50.543 --> 02:26:51.944]  It's being passed around by social media.
[02:26:52.104 --> 02:26:53.445]  You understand how this is playing out.
[02:26:53.945 --> 02:27:04.853]  And it was just yesterday that we saw a major economic attack on Breitbart, with Kellogg pulling their sponsorship, pulling their ads from their site.
[02:27:05.493 --> 02:27:07.855]  And then Breitbart says, Oh, we don't match your values.
[02:27:07.895 --> 02:27:08.756]  What are your values?
[02:27:08.836 --> 02:27:20.045]  And they talked about how Amnesty International has done an investigation showing that Kellogg is using child labor so that they can get palm oil to put in their sugar loaded cereal.
[02:27:20.185 --> 02:27:24.028]  You know, it's not much of a hyperbole to say just throw out the sugar of the cereal.
[02:27:24.429 --> 02:27:27.351]  It is sugar throughout the cereal and eat the box.
[02:27:27.371 --> 02:27:30.053]  You'll be better off from a nutritional standpoint.
[02:27:30.073 --> 02:27:31.114]  It's not much of a hyperbole.
[02:27:31.194 --> 02:27:31.755]  That's why
[02:27:32.415 --> 02:27:40.383]  We sell the kind of products that we do here at InfoWars to maintain our independence and also to provide you with things that are going to protect your health, not undermine it.
[02:27:40.743 --> 02:27:44.086]  That's what you get from the corporate junk that they're feeding you.
[02:27:44.327 --> 02:27:46.749]  Both the junk for your body and the junk for your mind.
[02:27:46.769 --> 02:27:49.612]  So we try to offer you high quality products and we do.
[02:27:49.692 --> 02:27:51.273]  We have things like DNA Force.
[02:27:51.914 --> 02:27:55.276]  That is a unique blend of ingredients.
[02:27:55.336 --> 02:27:59.617]  We've got bio PQQ is one of the active ingredients in this.
[02:27:59.678 --> 02:28:02.739]  That is something that's been backed by 175 clinical studies.
[02:28:03.039 --> 02:28:05.460]  Very difficult to secure, very expensive to produce.
[02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:13.304]  But it's also there with a lot of other things like vitamin C, Co Q 10, a lot of anti very potent antioxidants there.
[02:28:13.664 --> 02:28:18.226]  It's just one ingredient and DNA force cost us about $30,000 per batch.
[02:28:18.286 --> 02:28:20.767]  So it's a premium product for your health.
[02:28:20.947 --> 02:28:21.267]  We're good to go.
[02:28:21.287 --> 02:28:24.409]  And it's something that we put together a unique formulation at InfoWars.
[02:28:24.849 --> 02:28:30.092]  Also we have vitamin mineral fusion drink mixes back in stock at InfoWars life .com.
[02:28:30.592 --> 02:28:31.893]  That's an affordable, great tasting.
[02:28:36.436 --> 02:28:38.899]  Full vitamin, multivitamin regime.
[02:28:38.939 --> 02:28:41.643]  You can take that orally so you don't have to swallow a lot of pills.
[02:28:41.723 --> 02:28:50.175]  It's got vitamin E, zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine, alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, many other ingredients.
[02:28:50.215 --> 02:28:52.518]  Again, that's back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[02:28:53.599 --> 02:28:57.841]  I think it's also interesting at the dredge report today, of course, the top of the dredge report says Kelly.
[02:28:58.781 --> 02:29:05.604]  Megan Kelly might jump and unfortunately she's not on a bridge, which many of us would kind of like to see.
[02:29:05.904 --> 02:29:09.085]  No, she's talking about he's talking about jumping from Fox News to CNN.
[02:29:09.905 --> 02:29:10.906]  It's an exclusive article.
[02:29:11.006 --> 02:29:15.988]  Drudge report has that he says CNN president Jeff Zucker is actively pursuing her.
[02:29:16.008 --> 02:29:21.130]  An inside source said he is moving the Himalayan mountains to get her.
[02:29:21.690 --> 02:29:27.696]  They talk about how she's deeply despised by fellow on air talent, and I would say by much of the Fox audience as well.
[02:29:27.716 --> 02:29:28.617]  He's got a poll there.
[02:29:29.358 --> 02:29:31.741]  I've already voted for her to go to CNN.
[02:29:31.801 --> 02:29:35.064]  I thought it's kind of interesting, too, on the Dredge Report, they got a black Santa Claus.
[02:29:35.084 --> 02:29:39.869]  Remember, it was Megyn Kelly saying that, hey, you know, we all know that Santa Claus is white.
[02:29:40.189 --> 02:29:40.369]  Well...
[02:29:41.070 --> 02:29:41.531]  Not now.
[02:29:41.931 --> 02:29:43.173]  We've got a black Santa Claus.
[02:29:43.473 --> 02:29:44.535]  I think that's kind of cool.
[02:29:44.595 --> 02:29:48.040]  I'd like to see kind of a Louis Armstrong Santa Claus, you know?
[02:29:48.160 --> 02:29:50.723]  I think somebody that's having a lot of fun.
[02:29:50.763 --> 02:29:51.504]  Louis, right back.
[02:29:51.785 --> 02:29:53.387]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.328 --> 02:29:57.012]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.135 --> 02:30:03.056]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:30:03.096 --> 02:30:04.176]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:30:04.416 --> 02:30:05.337]  Why is this so good?
[02:30:05.637 --> 02:30:10.878]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:30:10.959 --> 02:30:24.523]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:30:24.563 --> 02:30:25.944]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:30:26.864 --> 02:30:28.306]  Spreading disease around.
[02:30:28.366 --> 02:30:30.869]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:30:30.909 --> 02:30:32.231]  These are all parasites.
[02:30:32.271 --> 02:30:33.372]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:30:33.392 --> 02:30:34.453]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:30:34.734 --> 02:30:39.079]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:30:39.279 --> 02:30:42.443]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:30:42.483 --> 02:30:45.605]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:30:45.625 --> 02:30:46.626]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:30:46.686 --> 02:30:48.567]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:48.628 --> 02:30:49.628]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:30:49.648 --> 02:30:51.730]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:30:52.370 --> 02:30:55.392]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:55.653 --> 02:30:57.534]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:30:57.914 --> 02:30:59.876]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:31:01.010 --> 02:31:05.372]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:31:05.492 --> 02:31:16.438]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:31:16.578 --> 02:31:21.522]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:31:21.622 --> 02:31:24.144]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:31:24.204 --> 02:31:25.726]  It helps detoxify.
[02:31:25.926 --> 02:31:28.768]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:31:28.808 --> 02:31:33.572]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:31:33.612 --> 02:31:39.837]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:31:39.877 --> 02:31:43.080]  So it really is an all-around nutrient.
[02:31:43.080 --> 02:31:45.142]  It's a nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:31:45.242 --> 02:31:46.683]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[02:31:46.883 --> 02:31:47.603]  This is so key.
[02:31:47.864 --> 02:31:52.167]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:31:52.207 --> 02:31:54.308]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:31:54.429 --> 02:31:57.891]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:01.397 --> 02:32:02.218]  Breaking news!
[02:32:02.499 --> 02:32:05.503]  California wants to succeed after a Donald Trump victory.
[02:32:05.724 --> 02:32:07.707]  Article up by the Sacramento Bee.
[02:32:08.007 --> 02:32:08.628]  Want to get away?
[02:32:08.828 --> 02:32:12.854]  Cal exits succession plan possible, but faces huge hurdles.
[02:32:13.175 --> 02:32:14.897]  Well, guess what, California?
[02:32:14.998 --> 02:32:17.121]  The rest of America's not your hurdle.
[02:32:17.281 --> 02:32:18.261]  Because we're all for it!
[02:32:18.541 --> 02:32:19.081]  Please!
[02:32:19.362 --> 02:32:20.122]  Leave now!
[02:32:20.382 --> 02:32:37.126]  Let's take all the good people out of there, because there's some good ones down there, and then we'll just dump the rest of Portland, and New York, and Miami, and Austin, and all the liberal hellholes, and we'll just dump them all in California, and we'll even help break away the land and push you guys out in the ocean.
[02:32:37.446 --> 02:32:38.427]  That'd be even better.
[02:32:38.627 --> 02:32:40.707]  You don't even have to have borders, because guess what?
[02:32:41.147 --> 02:32:43.808]  Nobody's gonna want to go there, because that sounds like
[02:32:44.028 --> 02:32:45.188]  Hell on earth.
[02:32:45.529 --> 02:32:52.872]  Now facing Donald Trump's imminent entrance to the Oval Office, the once outlandish idea of succession doesn't seem so crazy anymore to some Californians.
[02:32:53.092 --> 02:32:54.692]  Doesn't sound crazy to me either.
[02:32:54.992 --> 02:32:55.653]  See you later!
[02:32:55.893 --> 02:32:58.494]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com
[02:33:14.992 --> 02:33:21.284]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.418 --> 02:33:27.780]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:33:28.421 --> 02:33:36.309]  Joining us from Cincinnati, Ohio is Owen Schroeder, and he's there to cover the victory rally tonight.
[02:33:36.349 --> 02:33:41.295]  Now right now, Donald Trump is in Indianapolis, Indiana, or on his way there.
[02:33:41.355 --> 02:33:46.880]  His first stop is going to be at the carrier plant, where they were just able to save a thousand jobs.
[02:33:47.661 --> 02:33:52.103]  And he is going to be going, though, later tonight to Cincinnati, Ohio, where our reporters are.
[02:33:52.123 --> 02:33:54.744]  We're going to have an update on that tonight on the nightly news.
[02:33:54.804 --> 02:33:57.705]  But right now, let's go to Owen Schroer in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[02:33:57.745 --> 02:33:58.245]  Welcome, Owen.
[02:33:59.285 --> 02:34:00.226]  Well, that's right, David.
[02:34:00.246 --> 02:34:04.927]  You know, we heard that commercial during the break of Obama saying, how is Trump going to bring jobs back?
[02:34:04.967 --> 02:34:06.328]  What, is he going to wave a magic wand?
[02:34:06.768 --> 02:34:09.749]  Well, I guess Trump has a magic wand then, because he's bringing jobs back.
[02:34:09.809 --> 02:34:11.530]  So how about that for Barack Obama?
[02:34:11.550 --> 02:34:12.510]  Trump has a magic wand.
[02:34:12.750 --> 02:34:12.950]  Yeah.
[02:34:13.191 --> 02:34:13.631]  Yeah, of course.
[02:34:14.631 --> 02:34:19.413]  Barack Obama never did anything to save a single job in his entire time there.
[02:34:20.054 --> 02:34:24.416]  Some of the people who were on the free market side said, well, look, you know, there were some incentives.
[02:34:24.456 --> 02:34:27.877]  Now we learned about $7 million worth of incentives given to Carrier.
[02:34:27.937 --> 02:34:29.278]  That's over a 10-year period.
[02:34:29.638 --> 02:34:34.441]  So if you divide that out by 1,000 jobs, it's about $7,000 per job over a 10-year period.
[02:34:34.461 --> 02:34:35.821]  So it's about $700 a year.
[02:34:36.341 --> 02:34:40.143]  But they also are going to, Carrier is going to make a $16 million investment.
[02:34:40.163 --> 02:34:43.425]  So they're investing more than twice as much as they're getting back in a subsidy.
[02:34:43.985 --> 02:34:46.686]  And for those 1,000 people, that is making a huge difference.
[02:34:46.706 --> 02:34:58.791]  What we've seen from Obama is essentially threatening to bankrupt entire industries, and doing so, taking over our health care system, turning it into a major tax and a mandate, and doubling the price of health care.
[02:34:58.911 --> 02:35:05.094]  More than that, for a lot of people, it's tripled or quadrupled for many people, but we're seeing massive increases in the price of health care.
[02:35:05.114 --> 02:35:11.617]  That's his singular accomplishment that he created with his executive order, but he never did anything to save anybody's jobs.
[02:35:12.674 --> 02:35:29.459]  Well, he might have saved some jobs for some big bankers who had to get bailed out, but nonetheless, Trump hasn't even become president yet, and it's perfectly fair to say that he's done more for the average American worker than President Obama did in eight years as president, and Trump hasn't even become the president yet.
[02:35:29.599 --> 02:35:31.280]  Now, we are here in Cincinnati.
[02:35:31.340 --> 02:35:36.842]  As you said, David, Trump is going to start what is being dubbed his victory tour here tonight in Cincinnati.
[02:35:36.862 --> 02:35:38.462]  It's going to be held at the U.S.
[02:35:38.522 --> 02:35:40.523]  Bank Arena, which is right behind me.
[02:35:40.563 --> 02:35:48.926]  We are actually, it's pretty much in the heart of downtown, right here by the riverside, next to the great American baseball field, and then the football field right down the street as well.
[02:35:49.386 --> 02:35:50.847]  And there's already some patrons out here.
[02:35:50.887 --> 02:35:52.107]  Not too much foot traffic yet.
[02:35:52.167 --> 02:35:53.548]  The rally is not till tonight.
[02:35:53.988 --> 02:35:58.330]  But if I get my cameraman to look down here, you'll actually see that there's some nice capitalists.
[02:35:58.650 --> 02:36:00.971]  We've got some American capitalists out here, some vendors.
[02:36:01.331 --> 02:36:06.413]  They're selling some Trump gear, Trump hats, scarves, t-shirts, hoodies, bags, mugs, pins.
[02:36:06.833 --> 02:36:08.474]  They got it all ready to go.
[02:36:09.054 --> 02:36:21.419]  And it'll be interesting for me, David, to see, you know, Donald Trump had probably one of the biggest presidential election campaigns ever as far as rally turnout was concerned, as far as
[02:36:22.461 --> 02:36:22.681]  You know,
[02:36:39.839 --> 02:36:40.739]  We're good to go.
[02:36:40.799 --> 02:36:41.780]  We're good to go.
[02:36:42.100 --> 02:36:42.480]  We're good to go.
[02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:43.020]  We're good to go.
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:44.321]  We're good to go.
[02:36:44.361 --> 02:36:45.041]  We're good to go.
[02:36:45.081 --> 02:36:45.621]  We're good to go.
[02:36:45.681 --> 02:36:46.282]  We're good to go.
[02:36:46.302 --> 02:36:46.722]  We're good to go.
[02:36:46.742 --> 02:36:47.282]  We're good to go.
[02:36:47.342 --> 02:36:48.162]  We're good to go.
[02:36:48.262 --> 02:36:48.983]  We're good to go.
[02:36:49.283 --> 02:36:49.943]  We're good to go.
[02:36:49.963 --> 02:36:50.723]  We're good to go.
[02:36:50.743 --> 02:36:51.184]  We're good to go.
[02:36:51.204 --> 02:36:52.104]  We're good to go.
[02:36:52.124 --> 02:36:53.044]  We're good to go.
[02:36:53.084 --> 02:36:53.545]  We're good to go.
[02:36:53.585 --> 02:36:55.005]  We're good to go.
[02:36:55.045 --> 02:36:55.625]  We're good to go.
[02:36:55.906 --> 02:36:56.646]  We're good to go.
[02:36:56.666 --> 02:36:57.086]  We're good to go.
[02:36:57.106 --> 02:36:57.706]  We're good to go.
[02:36:57.826 --> 02:36:58.927]  We're good to go.
[02:36:58.947 --> 02:36:59.527]  We're good to go.
[02:36:59.607 --> 02:37:00.047]  We're good to go.
[02:37:00.067 --> 02:37:00.507]  We're good to go.
[02:37:00.547 --> 02:37:01.648]  We're good to go.
[02:37:01.668 --> 02:37:02.028]  We're good to go.
[02:37:02.068 --> 02:37:02.448]  We're good to go.
[02:37:02.468 --> 02:37:02.828]  We're good to go.
[02:37:02.848 --> 02:37:03.288]  We're good to go.
[02:37:03.308 --> 02:37:03.689]  We're good to go.
[02:37:03.729 --> 02:37:04.069]  We're good to go.
[02:37:04.089 --> 02:37:04.489]  We're good to go.
[02:37:04.509 --> 02:37:04.909]  We're good to go.
[02:37:04.949 --> 02:37:05.469]  We're good to go.
[02:37:05.489 --> 02:37:05.689]  We're
[02:37:07.389 --> 02:37:09.712]  What Trump did during the campaign was very different.
[02:37:09.892 --> 02:37:15.819]  We've never seen a candidate pull the kinds of crowds that he's done, have that many rallies, as you pointed out.
[02:37:15.859 --> 02:37:19.743]  But we've also never seen a candidate immediately after the election go back to the people.
[02:37:20.324 --> 02:37:22.967]  And I think, Owen, that is a real key point.
[02:37:23.147 --> 02:37:24.950]  If he can work with the people,
[02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:26.331]  We're good to go.
[02:37:43.001 --> 02:38:01.556]  But I think this is a very important thing that he's doing this to see him deliver on the promises that he's made in the past and to see even his picks that have come out, say, as we saw with the Treasury Secretary pick yesterday, Mnuchin, saying and reiterating step by step, point by point, what he was going to do with the economy.
[02:38:01.957 --> 02:38:08.682]  If Trump can stay on target with this, if he can fulfill these promises, it's going to be a really big win for all of us, I think.
[02:38:08.742 --> 02:38:10.684]  And it's essential because if we don't get that.
[02:38:11.444 --> 02:38:21.472]  If the people feel like they've been betrayed again, like we've been betrayed over and over by the GOP establishment, by Paul Ryan, by Mitch McConnell, they would campaign to say they're going to get rid of Obamacare, then not do it.
[02:38:22.273 --> 02:38:29.579]  If that's the sort of thing that happens, I think we're going to see a massive lurch back to the left, which would be a really bad thing for us in four years.
[02:38:29.619 --> 02:38:32.101]  So we hope that Trump is going to do this.
[02:38:32.401 --> 02:38:35.884]  I've never seen anybody move this quickly, even before taking office.
[02:38:35.904 --> 02:38:36.945]  We're still 50 days out.
[02:38:37.628 --> 02:38:46.432]  Well, and I know that you might be fundamentally disagreeing with this because that's not the role the president is supposed to play, but Donald Trump might be the first hands-on president.
[02:38:46.692 --> 02:39:05.861]  I mean, are we looking at a guy who, instead of sitting in his ivory tower all day long, flying around around the world on Air Force One, visiting all these leaders around the world, are we looking at a president who's going to be hands-on, visiting the inner cities of America, going to city to city to figure out what is wrong with the city, what the people want to hear, what the people want to see, what the people want to happen?
[02:39:06.361 --> 02:39:14.808]  I know that, like I said, I think fundamentally you are more like a president, leave me alone, stay out of my business, you know, just sit at the White House all day and play tiddlywinks, I'll worry about my life.
[02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:22.495]  But, it would be diametrically opposed to what we've seen in the very recent past, specifically with Obama, but any president.
[02:39:22.555 --> 02:39:29.501]  I mean, I don't think there's ever been a president, like you said, to immediately start doing essentially rallies again after he won.
[02:39:30.081 --> 02:39:32.042]  But then let's say he does this even after he's elected.
[02:39:32.082 --> 02:39:45.726]  Let's say he continues to go city to city to speak to the people, see what's going on in these cities, figure out what he can do to help, figure out what he can do to help local business owners, figure out what he can do to help local builders, figure out what he can do with some of these cities that have all these abandoned buildings.
[02:39:45.766 --> 02:39:46.946]  He can go see it firsthand.
[02:39:46.966 --> 02:39:50.267]  He can walk on the streets, put on the hardhat, engage with these people.
[02:39:50.467 --> 02:39:51.848]  That's something we've never seen before.
[02:39:52.128 --> 02:39:54.609]  I would love to see Donald Trump be that president.
[02:39:54.689 --> 02:39:55.129]  I think that
[02:39:55.549 --> 02:40:04.172]  Well, yeah, when I say that I want him to leave us alone, I don't mean that he doesn't need to get involved, that he shouldn't use a bully pulpit to do that.
[02:40:04.212 --> 02:40:11.134]  And I think if he used a bully pulpit to nudge Carrier along and to tell them, hey, I'm going to create a great environment here in America, you want to be a part of that?
[02:40:11.354 --> 02:40:15.475]  You've got a positive role to play here by selling yourself as a U.S.
[02:40:15.555 --> 02:40:15.875]  company.
[02:40:16.475 --> 02:40:17.496]  But thank you, Owen.
[02:40:17.516 --> 02:40:20.679]  We're going to be looking for what happens tonight on the Nightly News.
[02:40:20.739 --> 02:40:21.840]  And again, this is Owen Shore.
[02:40:21.900 --> 02:40:23.201]  He's in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[02:40:23.221 --> 02:40:30.627]  They're going to be covering the first Victory Tour as Donald Trump goes to supporters in Cincinnati, Ohio tonight.
[02:40:30.667 --> 02:40:33.049]  Right now, we've got Alex Jones on the line.
[02:40:33.089 --> 02:40:33.710]  He's calling in.
[02:40:33.770 --> 02:40:36.572]  He's not in the studio today, but let's go to Alex Jones right now.
[02:40:36.672 --> 02:40:36.912]  Alex.
[02:40:38.113 --> 02:40:38.454]  That's right.
[02:40:38.474 --> 02:40:41.396]  From an undisclosed location, my friend, working on some very important
[02:40:41.980 --> 02:40:42.540]  We're good to go.
[02:41:04.625 --> 02:41:06.666]  He's delivered on Apple now saying they're looking at coming back.
[02:41:06.967 --> 02:41:08.888]  Carrier, and it's called the Trump Effect.
[02:41:08.908 --> 02:41:11.090]  There's an article on InfoWars.com today.
[02:41:11.530 --> 02:41:16.113]  Hundreds of companies now saying they're planning to stay as well.
[02:41:16.453 --> 02:41:17.294]  Now it's okay.
[02:41:17.334 --> 02:41:18.595]  It's cool to stay in America.
[02:41:18.655 --> 02:41:20.236]  Now Americans will buy American.
[02:41:20.456 --> 02:41:22.057]  This is going to do a lot of stuff, but it gets worse than that.
[02:41:23.424 --> 02:41:30.907]  The Communist Chinese People's Daily came out today, the article's on Infowars.com, and they said, you will, quote, never regain your greatness.
[02:41:31.207 --> 02:41:35.669]  They actually said, you will never regain your greatness, like a bad character from a comic book.
[02:41:35.969 --> 02:41:37.990]  You will never regain your greatness.
[02:41:38.250 --> 02:41:39.570]  We have taken it all.
[02:41:39.931 --> 02:41:41.191]  Nothing will be there.
[02:41:41.451 --> 02:41:43.492]  And these will not be like the jobs you had before.
[02:41:43.852 --> 02:41:44.612]  You are done.
[02:41:44.853 --> 02:41:46.553]  We dominate rare earth minerals.
[02:41:46.714 --> 02:41:48.374]  We have control of everything.
[02:41:48.554 --> 02:41:50.716]  There is nothing you can page after page of.
[02:41:50.856 --> 02:41:53.437]  There is nothing you can do against us.
[02:41:53.777 --> 02:42:02.041]  So, but then, the top diplomats saying actually that's China super scared because they realize how they bought off our politicians and gave them control of the factories.
[02:42:02.061 --> 02:42:05.283]  A lot of these globalists make billions every few years off these
[02:42:05.942 --> 02:42:07.344]  We're good to go.
[02:42:21.004 --> 02:42:23.905]  To take that clip where Obama's going, ha ha, you can't bring them back?
[02:42:24.145 --> 02:42:25.046]  How you gonna bring them back?
[02:42:25.126 --> 02:42:27.106]  Little jobs ain't coming back.
[02:42:28.807 --> 02:42:30.748]  I'm a community organizer who works day of my life.
[02:42:30.968 --> 02:42:32.389]  Howdy, howdy, how you gonna do anything?
[02:42:32.429 --> 02:42:33.209]  You can't do anything.
[02:42:34.749 --> 02:42:38.611]  With all that laughing, just like the Communist Chinese.
[02:42:38.851 --> 02:42:40.732]  They're not laughing now, just like with Brexit.
[02:42:41.032 --> 02:42:42.353]  Just like with everything else we're doing.
[02:42:42.613 --> 02:42:43.673]  We're bringing it home.
[02:42:44.053 --> 02:42:44.834]  Fair deals.
[02:42:45.194 --> 02:42:46.934]  You name it, it'll build up the entire world.
[02:42:46.974 --> 02:42:48.395]  Globalism sucks the world down.
[02:42:48.891 --> 02:42:50.373]  Globalism expands the world.
[02:42:50.993 --> 02:42:52.034]  Globalism empowers.
[02:42:52.695 --> 02:42:53.676]  No, no, that's not what it does.
[02:42:53.976 --> 02:42:55.858]  Globalism absolutely enslaves.
[02:42:56.179 --> 02:43:00.623]  So they told us over and over again that globalism was the answer, that globalism would make us all rich.
[02:43:00.683 --> 02:43:00.884]  No.
[02:43:01.304 --> 02:43:03.767]  Nationalism is what rises up the world.
[02:43:04.007 --> 02:43:09.333]  And then globally, not through command and control, but through individual action, empowers populations.
[02:43:09.373 --> 02:43:11.515]  That's called renaissance that I keep hyping.
[02:43:11.915 --> 02:43:13.318]  So folks, we're here.
[02:43:13.599 --> 02:43:14.321]  It's unfolding.
[02:43:14.561 --> 02:43:15.924]  It's an exciting time to be alive.
[02:43:16.245 --> 02:43:20.554]  And the only problem that Greene's report is he didn't mention what's happening with Ford and others.
[02:43:20.959 --> 02:43:22.499]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:43:22.519 --> 02:43:23.540]  You're doing a great job, David.
[02:43:23.780 --> 02:43:26.160]  It's so good to be able to sit here and listen to you guys.
[02:43:26.561 --> 02:43:27.401]  Absolutely kicked butt.
[02:43:27.421 --> 02:43:31.062]  Sort of the listeners, and the affiliates, and the sponsors, and the great crew, and everybody.
[02:43:31.342 --> 02:43:32.542]  We're making history together.
[02:43:32.562 --> 02:43:34.943]  This is really amazing, and it's only getting better.
[02:43:35.183 --> 02:43:36.223]  There will be wild cards.
[02:43:36.263 --> 02:43:37.864]  The enemy will shoot torpedoes at us.
[02:43:38.224 --> 02:43:44.486]  This is an amazing time to be alive, but I'm telling you, I hope for the nightly news, or for the rest of the show today, somebody goes and finds the article on InfoWars.
[02:43:44.546 --> 02:43:45.546]  I'm out in front of the computer.
[02:43:45.926 --> 02:43:48.947]  It quotes the Communist Chinese, or just Google.
[02:43:49.716 --> 02:43:54.721]  Chinese paper, state-run, you know, says you will never regain your greatness.
[02:43:55.081 --> 02:43:57.423]  See, globalism was supposed to make us great, but it didn't.
[02:43:57.463 --> 02:44:00.146]  It was the giant sucking sound that we were warned of.
[02:44:00.446 --> 02:44:01.587]  Look, I'm gonna let you guys go.
[02:44:01.607 --> 02:44:02.588]  Sorry about the audio quality.
[02:44:02.608 --> 02:44:03.148]  You're awesome.
[02:44:03.208 --> 02:44:03.709]  Love you all.
[02:44:03.729 --> 02:44:04.089]  Keep it up.
[02:44:04.109 --> 02:44:07.092]  Let's all get good spy efforts, because this is an exciting time to be alive.
[02:44:07.472 --> 02:44:07.952]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:44:08.152 --> 02:44:10.854]  Yeah, and of course, China is getting on their full Dr. Evil.
[02:44:10.894 --> 02:44:15.577]  I wonder if they put the little pinky on the corner of their mouth when they said, you will never retain your greatness.
[02:44:15.717 --> 02:44:27.825]  But, you know, one of the things that we need to understand, I'm going to play this Darren McBrain piece again, where we've got the flashback to Obama planning to, you know, saying that Trump can't keep the carrier in the United States.
[02:44:27.845 --> 02:44:28.526]  Well, he just did.
[02:44:28.666 --> 02:44:29.146]  And you know what?
[02:44:29.666 --> 02:44:31.488]  He's not even president, Obama.
[02:44:32.228 --> 02:44:33.869]  Obama, you are president.
[02:44:34.269 --> 02:44:37.690]  You could have done what Donald Trump just did, but you didn't, did you?
[02:44:38.331 --> 02:44:39.111]  You're still in office.
[02:44:39.151 --> 02:44:41.272]  What are you doing in your final days?
[02:44:41.952 --> 02:44:49.655]  You're pushing through massive regulations that are going to cost billions of dollars if you get them through, and a lot of jobs if you can get them through.
[02:44:49.875 --> 02:44:51.796]  So what is Obama doing in his final days?
[02:44:52.476 --> 02:45:00.800]  He's trying to put as many chains on the American economy, as many chains on the American worker and businesses as he possibly can to go out.
[02:45:01.641 --> 02:45:10.186]  And I hope that Donald Trump comes in with his pen and just says, void, void, void, void, void on all these regulations because he has the power to do that.
[02:45:10.606 --> 02:45:12.587]  He can do that with Obamacare and I hope he does that as well.
[02:45:12.827 --> 02:45:19.091]  But let's go back to this flashback with Obama mocking Donald Trump saying, you can't save jobs.
[02:45:19.231 --> 02:45:26.495]  And remember, it's Obama who hasn't lifted a finger even though he is still president and Trump is still 50 days out.
[02:45:26.535 --> 02:45:28.036]  So here's that flashback of Obama.
[02:45:29.386 --> 02:45:41.934]  Well, Barack Obama is looking pretty stupid right now, as a video has surfaced where he is seen making fun of Donald Trump for promising to stop jobs leaving the country.
[02:45:42.094 --> 02:45:43.575]  He's gonna bring all these jobs back.
[02:45:43.876 --> 02:45:45.156]  Well, how exactly are you gonna do that?
[02:45:45.176 --> 02:45:46.437]  What are you gonna do?
[02:45:47.078 --> 02:45:47.918]  There's no answer to it.
[02:45:48.178 --> 02:45:50.920]  He just says, well, I'm gonna negotiate a better deal.
[02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:54.122]  Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[02:45:54.242 --> 02:45:55.623]  What magic wand do you have?
[02:45:56.004 --> 02:45:57.645]  And usually the answer is,
[02:45:58.525 --> 02:45:59.766]  He doesn't have an answer.
[02:46:29.106 --> 02:46:30.406]  Again, that breaks it down perfectly.
[02:46:30.446 --> 02:46:31.147]  Thank you, Darren.
[02:46:31.227 --> 02:46:36.430]  And of course, think about what we would be seeing right now if Hillary had won the election.
[02:46:36.550 --> 02:46:37.291]  What would she be doing?
[02:46:37.411 --> 02:46:43.495]  Well, she would be going around raising money with parties of the wealthy and the northy.
[02:46:43.535 --> 02:46:50.840]  She'd be traveling to see foreign governments who are going to make connections and contributions to the Clinton Foundation.
[02:46:51.120 --> 02:46:52.081]  She'd be basking
[02:46:52.721 --> 02:47:03.709]  In the glory of the media, seeing all the rock stars and everybody would be writing all of these fawning pieces about the first woman president.
[02:47:03.729 --> 02:47:10.695]  So she'd be patting herself on the back instead of drowning herself in her sorrows, as reportedly an insider is saying.
[02:47:10.735 --> 02:47:15.198]  And we got an article from Kit Daniels talking about how she's kind of in the bottle a lot lately.
[02:47:15.218 --> 02:47:21.543]  It's right there, trying to drown her sorrows, lift her spirits by consuming a good number of spirits.
[02:47:22.043 --> 02:47:25.666]  Well, it's not just Obama that was saying Donald Trump can't save jobs.
[02:47:26.146 --> 02:47:27.387]  And he never tried, of course.
[02:47:27.828 --> 02:47:29.789]  Obama never even tried to save a single job.
[02:47:30.890 --> 02:47:32.091]  So he wouldn't know about that.
[02:47:32.171 --> 02:47:33.912]  He's never run a company.
[02:47:33.952 --> 02:47:35.373]  He's never actually created a job.
[02:47:35.834 --> 02:47:37.495]  And he's never saved any jobs.
[02:47:37.535 --> 02:47:41.538]  Remember when they said how many jobs that they had saved?
[02:47:41.678 --> 02:47:44.160]  And it's like, well, I don't think you saved any jobs.
[02:47:44.660 --> 02:47:47.863]  And certainly he didn't save anybody's jobs at Carrier when he could.
[02:47:48.643 --> 02:47:52.085]  He didn't wave his magic wand, but Donald Trump did wave his magic wand.
[02:47:52.105 --> 02:47:54.366]  But I want to take a look at Chuck Schumer.
[02:47:55.446 --> 02:48:03.590]  Chuckie Schumer and Harry Reid were talking about how they think they can successfully block some of the nominations of Donald Trump.
[02:48:04.131 --> 02:48:06.752]  And I want to play you that clip and then we're going to tell you why they can't.
[02:48:09.933 --> 02:48:10.594]  You don't have that clip?
[02:48:11.403 --> 02:48:14.129]  Okay, let's go to that clip in just a moment.
[02:48:14.831 --> 02:48:19.722]  One of the things that they're pushing back, and you're going to see this in this clip when these guys get it, is the fact that
[02:48:21.078 --> 02:48:21.798]  Okay, you got that clip?
[02:48:21.818 --> 02:48:22.978]  Okay, let's play the clip first.
[02:48:22.998 --> 02:48:31.780]  There ought to be bipartisan support against a secretary who's going to privatize Medicare and not fund Planned Parenthood.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:33.081]  Not fund Planned Parenthood?
[02:48:33.201 --> 02:48:38.662]  Are you saying you think there's any reasonable way you guys could have won the press nomination?
[02:48:38.682 --> 02:48:39.662]  I think it's possible.
[02:48:39.722 --> 02:48:44.463]  You'll have to ask a number of... I can't get back to the microphone because I already took it over.
[02:48:45.043 --> 02:48:48.104]  On privatization of Medicare, that go... Sorry.
[02:48:52.625 --> 02:49:06.607]  Okay, what you're seeing there, and that was a great visual as well, if you're watching that, because they really are so disoriented and in such disarray, they can't even decide who's going to be talking.
[02:49:07.247 --> 02:49:19.090]  Harry Reid, who is long past his sell-by date, took the microphone there as they were still asking questions to Chuckie Schumer, and Chuck Schumer is trying to get from one side to the other.
[02:49:19.930 --> 02:49:21.651]  Harry Reid just continues to stand there.
[02:49:22.312 --> 02:49:42.926]  But what Chuckie Schumer had said before Harry Reid took the podium away from him, for the longest time he had talked, before that, he had gone on for several minutes talking about Medicare and Medicaid, and saying we're going to block this guy that Donald Trump has selected for HHS, Tom Price, because we think he's going to change Medicare and Medicaid.
[02:49:43.446 --> 02:49:46.789]  Well think about that for a moment, and think about that in terms of Obamacare.
[02:49:47.449 --> 02:49:49.310]  I think we have an opportunity here with Obamacare.
[02:49:49.390 --> 02:49:53.631]  If they don't move quickly on this to shut it down, it will never happen.
[02:49:53.671 --> 02:50:06.236]  And of course, the Democrats, through outlets like Politico, are saying that we want to work with the Republicans to make sure that even though they may pass a resolution to eventually get rid of Obamacare, that that doesn't really happen for three years.
[02:50:06.316 --> 02:50:06.837]  I have to say,
[02:50:07.857 --> 02:50:20.756]  If Donald Trump falls for that, and I don't think he will, I don't think his administration will fall for that, but if they do something in terms of passing a goodwill resolution, say we're going to get rid of it in three years, and don't get rid of it right away, don't repeal it right away, it'll never happen.
[02:50:21.519 --> 02:50:29.361]  It'll be just like the Department of Education that Ronald Reagan said he was going to campaign on, that he was elected to get rid of.
[02:50:29.381 --> 02:50:34.683]  It was something that had just been created by Jimmy Carter, and instead of doing that, he kept feeding it.
[02:50:35.323 --> 02:50:43.645]  And if you allow Obamacare to stay for another three years, and this is the reason they want to delay it, it's going to get so entrenched in the minds of the people
[02:50:44.225 --> 02:50:45.505]  That they will think, you can't touch this.
[02:50:45.565 --> 02:50:47.126]  Just like Medicare or Medicaid.
[02:50:47.426 --> 02:50:49.747]  They don't want to see any improvement to Medicare or Medicaid.
[02:50:49.767 --> 02:50:50.947]  It's just got to stay the way that it is.
[02:50:51.247 --> 02:50:53.668]  Because they can't remember there was a time when it wasn't there.
[02:50:53.688 --> 02:50:54.048]  You know what?
[02:50:54.448 --> 02:50:55.969]  I'm an aspiring senior citizen.
[02:50:56.009 --> 02:50:57.649]  I hope someday to live long enough to be one.
[02:50:57.969 --> 02:50:59.930]  I want to have some choices in my health care.
[02:50:59.950 --> 02:51:00.930]  I want to see an improvement in it.
[02:51:01.210 --> 02:51:02.871]  I mentioned this on the show before.
[02:51:02.951 --> 02:51:05.372]  Bringing back life to the inner cities in America.
[02:51:05.792 --> 02:51:08.052]  Of course that means bringing jobs back home.
[02:51:08.633 --> 02:51:12.834]  But you know the other day I looked on a search engine and I found in Chicago
[02:51:14.089 --> 02:51:18.833]  Not just an urban farm, but a directory of urban farms.
[02:51:19.374 --> 02:51:29.862]  I saw at least eight of these local operations that are all geared to growing fresh nutritious food for people by people who live there and so on and so forth.
[02:51:30.542 --> 02:51:32.144]  That's a revolution right there.
[02:51:32.944 --> 02:51:39.990]  Let's put a hundred, a thousand, five thousand of these urban farms in inner cities across America for a pittance.
[02:51:40.848 --> 02:51:43.750]  People themselves could form them as businesses and make money.
[02:51:44.311 --> 02:51:47.073]  If Trump is listening to this, here's a clue.
[02:51:47.473 --> 02:51:49.434]  You want to bring back inner cities?
[02:51:50.215 --> 02:52:00.543]  Of course you offer people jobs, good jobs, and also programs like this that for a tiny amount of money can reverse life completely in these inner cities.
[02:52:01.143 --> 02:52:01.944]  So I think
[02:52:03.317 --> 02:52:14.478]  That the new administration in Washington, if they have a clue about anything, and they seem to, are going to be listening to people like us because we've been looking at solutions all along.
[02:52:15.143 --> 02:52:16.364]  This is nothing new for us.
[02:52:16.464 --> 02:52:22.326]  Just point out to the people that very quickly they can make this into a profit making business of their own.
[02:52:22.767 --> 02:52:28.169]  So they can eat fresh nutritious food that they grow for nothing and then they can sell the food.
[02:52:28.770 --> 02:52:32.471]  And all of a sudden you've got free market coming back into the inner cities.
[02:52:32.591 --> 02:52:35.653]  And my feeling is, and I mentioned this to a couple of friends yesterday,
[02:52:36.670 --> 02:52:50.497]  If you're living in an inner city and all of a sudden it starts to blossom with, you know, one of these, several of these enterprises, growing food naturally, growing it outdoors, growing it in abandoned buildings, growing it in all kinds of places.
[02:52:51.298 --> 02:52:57.621]  Now, the people that live there are invested in that community in a way that they've never been before in their memory.
[02:52:58.441 --> 02:53:03.044]  Now they're feeding themselves and growing food and selling the food and making a profit.
[02:53:03.404 --> 02:53:04.184]  They're in business.
[02:53:04.744 --> 02:53:05.325]  And now,
[02:53:06.719 --> 02:53:21.291]  Their demand, the level of their demand to live in a safe community, free of thugs and gangs and drugs and so forth, reaches a new peak level that it's never been at before.
[02:53:21.871 --> 02:53:30.098]  This is not just, I want the freedom to be able to go down to the AM, PM, because that's the only store that's there, you know, no.
[02:53:30.698 --> 02:53:37.059]  We've got something to protect now that's real, that's feeding us and making us money on a true product.
[02:53:37.560 --> 02:53:41.060]  Now you're going to see life in those inner cities completely transformed.
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:52.603]  What solutions can we feed this new movement that has developed using Trump in a way as a symbol, you know, whatever else you want to say.
[02:53:52.623 --> 02:53:53.183]  A battering ram.
[02:53:54.164 --> 02:53:54.965]  A battering ram?
[02:53:55.225 --> 02:53:56.648]  The movement is gigantic.
[02:53:56.808 --> 02:53:58.911]  It got its legs under it with Ron Paul.
[02:53:59.412 --> 02:54:00.894]  These are many of the same people.
[02:54:10.144 --> 02:54:12.085]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:12.105 --> 02:54:13.446]  I've got one more segment with you.
[02:54:13.506 --> 02:54:18.427]  I'm David Knight, and then after that, we're going to be joined in the fourth hour by John Rappaport.
[02:54:18.447 --> 02:54:21.849]  Of course, his website is nomorefakenews.com.
[02:54:21.869 --> 02:54:23.229]  That's not something new that he created.
[02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:26.450]  John Rappaport had that site a long time ago.
[02:54:26.890 --> 02:54:31.652]  Because he knew, and he was telling everybody, and we've been telling everybody, the real fake news is CNN.
[02:54:31.712 --> 02:54:32.773]  But now they have adopted it.
[02:54:32.793 --> 02:54:36.054]  Maybe John ought to sue them for infringement.
[02:54:37.334 --> 02:54:38.275]  We're good to go.
[02:54:58.815 --> 02:54:59.716]  We're good to go.
[02:55:22.893 --> 02:55:29.098]  As I've been saying throughout this broadcast, that's the reason we fund our operation the way that we do, and we appreciate your support.
[02:55:29.158 --> 02:55:33.861]  We try to offer you healthy things for your body, not Kellogg's cereal.
[02:55:34.342 --> 02:55:37.164]  Things to help you get over that if you actually do eat that.
[02:55:37.724 --> 02:55:39.646]  And we've got some of those products now.
[02:55:40.086 --> 02:55:45.671]  I'll just remind you that we've gotten Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:55:46.491 --> 02:55:53.734]  That is a full month's supply of essential multivitamins and minerals and amino acids that your body needs.
[02:55:53.814 --> 02:55:56.695]  And again, that is back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[02:55:56.715 --> 02:56:01.297]  You can see the full list of nutrients there that we proudly display on our site.
[02:56:02.364 --> 02:56:06.926]  As well as we have DNA Force, which I would recommend to you, a unique product.
[02:56:07.786 --> 02:56:11.247]  BioPQQ, very difficult to secure, very expensive to secure.
[02:56:11.267 --> 02:56:18.209]  175 clinical studies back up how important that is and how beneficial that is for your health.
[02:56:18.550 --> 02:56:20.230]  Again, we appreciate your support.
[02:56:20.550 --> 02:56:28.153]  That's what allows us to continue and that is the way, and I think it's very wise that Alex did this to keep us from being susceptible to
[02:56:29.218 --> 02:56:37.624]  Individual companies pulling their advertising from us as we see the escalation of the media wars that began during the Trump campaign.
[02:56:37.704 --> 02:56:44.869]  It's been going on for quite some time, but of course it really came to a head with the Trump campaign and now it's going on full tilt.
[02:56:44.969 --> 02:56:49.493]  So we appreciate your support and look for those fine products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:56:50.193 --> 02:56:52.655]  Now as I was showing that clip before we went to the break,
[02:56:53.474 --> 02:56:53.875]  Of course.
[02:57:08.775 --> 02:57:10.476]  As a weapon that they scare people with.
[02:57:10.496 --> 02:57:14.180]  They always say, you know what, these people are going to change Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid.
[02:57:14.200 --> 02:57:16.902]  You know, I would like to see those programs change for the better.
[02:57:17.042 --> 02:57:21.265]  Just to say that I would have some more choice, some more control.
[02:57:21.305 --> 02:57:23.908]  As I said before we went to the break, I'm an aspiring senior citizen.
[02:57:24.188 --> 02:57:24.989]  I think everybody is.
[02:57:25.939 --> 02:57:29.122]  The only way to not become a senior citizen is to die young.
[02:57:29.322 --> 02:57:30.483]  So we don't want to do that.
[02:57:30.843 --> 02:57:38.369]  But I'm also somebody who would like to have more control over my life, as opposed to being treated like a child on an allowance.
[02:57:38.930 --> 02:57:45.115]  And I'm also not wedded to a government program that continues to not serve the needs of the people.
[02:57:45.175 --> 02:57:46.956]  So why can't we look at some changes?
[02:57:47.297 --> 02:57:53.742]  And that's why I said it's very important for Trump to repeal Obamacare and to replace it with a marketplace
[02:57:53.882 --> 02:57:56.904]  Just as he has talked about through the entire campaign.
[02:57:56.984 --> 02:58:02.147]  The second thing I think he put on his site was getting rid of Obamacare and what he would replace it with.
[02:58:02.167 --> 02:58:08.111]  He would replace it with a competitive marketplace where insurance companies could compete across state lines.
[02:58:08.151 --> 02:58:12.754]  See, you're not allowed to have any competition in America on health insurance.
[02:58:13.314 --> 02:58:18.178]  And this is put in by the same people who say we have to have open borders for trade.
[02:58:18.538 --> 02:58:20.800]  They stopped the trade within our borders.
[02:58:20.880 --> 02:58:24.383]  That's the kind of protectionism that Obamacare truly represents.
[02:58:24.403 --> 02:58:26.485]  That's why you're seeing the skyrocketing insurance.
[02:58:26.825 --> 02:58:27.666]  So we can do that.
[02:58:28.086 --> 02:58:29.227]  And you know the reason you can do it?
[02:58:29.667 --> 02:58:36.953]  It's because Harry Reid changed the rules to where they only need 51 votes to get in Trump's cabinet picks.
[02:58:37.253 --> 02:58:37.954]  That was Harry Reid.
[02:58:37.974 --> 02:58:41.637]  So he's blocking Chuckie Schumer just like he physically blocked him at that press conference.
[02:58:41.897 --> 02:58:42.617]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:42.837 --> 02:58:44.558]  John Rapoport in the next hour.
[02:58:45.038 --> 02:58:47.619]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:51.061 --> 02:58:52.441]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:58:52.461 --> 02:58:54.022]  You can't survive without it.
[02:58:54.182 --> 02:58:55.122]  But where do you get it?
[02:58:55.382 --> 02:59:01.165]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:59:01.385 --> 02:59:07.107]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:59:07.287 --> 02:59:24.154]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:59:24.534 --> 02:59:26.675]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:59:27.035 --> 02:59:28.236]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:59:28.496 --> 02:59:29.237]  Easy assembly.
[02:59:29.537 --> 02:59:30.157]  Low maintenance.
[02:59:30.457 --> 02:59:32.258]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:59:53.433 --> 02:59:56.215]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:57.035 --> 03:00:04.440]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:04.520 --> 03:00:08.443]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:22.085 --> 03:00:23.406]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:23.426 --> 03:00:24.006]  I'm David Knight.
[03:00:24.046 --> 03:00:28.029]  In the next segment, we're going to be joined by Jon Rappaport, NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[03:00:28.910 --> 03:00:35.815]  I have a couple of articles that I've been wanting to get through this entire show that I think are very important to see.
[03:00:36.055 --> 03:00:40.318]  This one is from the Free Thought Project, and we just got a press release from Julian Assange.
[03:00:41.559 --> 03:01:00.492]  WikiLeaks had a very important role to play in terms of educating the public, in terms of putting information out there so we could see the criminal actions of Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation in the background, so we could see what they were doing, conspiring together with the media.
[03:01:01.254 --> 03:01:01.554]  I don't
[03:01:24.907 --> 03:01:39.512]  Julian Assange's safety that people have had, there's now been a press release from WikiLeaks and what they're saying is that there's been another appeal to set him free to the United Nations and this is the press release.
[03:01:39.532 --> 03:01:45.874]  They said earlier this year the United Nations concluded the 16 month long case into which the United Kingdom was a party.
[03:01:46.394 --> 03:01:50.215]  The UK lost, appealed, and today lost again.
[03:01:50.908 --> 03:01:51.288]  The U.N.
[03:01:51.328 --> 03:01:52.109]  instructed the U.K.
[03:01:52.149 --> 03:01:58.291]  and Sweden to take immediate steps to ensure Mr. Assange's liberty, protection, and enjoyment of fundamental human rights.
[03:01:58.812 --> 03:02:05.495]  No steps have been taken, jeopardizing Mr. Assange's life, health, and physical integrity, and undermining the U.N.
[03:02:05.535 --> 03:02:07.235]  system of human rights protection.
[03:02:07.275 --> 03:02:08.116]  So this is interesting.
[03:02:08.656 --> 03:02:16.361]  Because they say now these appeals have been exhausted to the UN and they're trying to put pressure on the UK to release him.
[03:02:17.102 --> 03:02:18.423]  This is going back to February.
[03:02:18.463 --> 03:02:23.226]  They said the UN's working group on arbitrary detention is the one that is driving this.
[03:02:23.566 --> 03:02:25.908]  So hopefully there's going to be some developments there.
[03:02:26.448 --> 03:02:34.994]  And that is kind of a good sign because if they're pushing on that and saying they expect him to be released, that is a good sign that he is still there even though
[03:02:35.794 --> 03:02:51.169]  The terms of his imprisonment there, his imprisonment without being found guilty, have worsened since he released this information educating the public on Hillary Clinton and the political process here.
[03:02:51.870 --> 03:02:53.932]  Another report that has come out, another
[03:02:54.921 --> 03:02:55.701]  We're good.
[03:03:14.389 --> 03:03:15.229]  By any planes.
[03:03:15.829 --> 03:03:20.110]  He said he read that report for the first time in August of 2016, August of this year.
[03:03:20.130 --> 03:03:23.131]  15 years after the fact, he had not read it.
[03:03:23.351 --> 03:03:28.572]  See, that's why it's important to have media that is not part of the mainstream media.
[03:03:29.392 --> 03:03:39.094]  You just saw earlier in the program, Anderson Cooper mocking InfoWars, mocking Alex Jones, saying these are people who don't believe the government's official story.
[03:03:40.060 --> 03:03:40.680]  It's like, that's right.
[03:03:41.201 --> 03:03:42.122]  Didn't believe it day one.
[03:03:42.262 --> 03:03:43.643]  Donald Trump didn't believe it day one.
[03:03:43.983 --> 03:03:44.663]  Still don't believe it.
[03:03:44.984 --> 03:03:53.530]  And there's a lot of people out here, even people like this educated scientist who worked for 15 years for NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
[03:03:53.830 --> 03:04:01.696]  They're the ones that, most of these people who say, oh, you guys are just a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists, they go back to NIST and say, see, NIST said there's nothing to see.
[03:04:01.716 --> 03:04:07.901]  It's just natural that a steel building would fall down when it catches on fire, even though that has never happened before or since.
[03:04:08.381 --> 03:04:09.022]  And this building,
[03:04:09.642 --> 03:04:11.224]  Was not hit by a plane.
[03:04:11.664 --> 03:04:16.288]  That's why I've talked to the United Kingdom documentarian Tony Rook.
[03:04:16.448 --> 03:04:17.649]  He has interviewed people.
[03:04:17.689 --> 03:04:22.594]  There's one UK fireman who went to bat for this in the UK.
[03:04:23.355 --> 03:04:27.538]  They're not trying to repeal the Patriot Act there, but he knows that this matters.
[03:04:27.599 --> 03:04:31.762]  He's a fireman and he says, wait, if this story is true, if a steel
[03:04:32.623 --> 03:04:34.104]  Building like this can just fall down.
[03:04:34.424 --> 03:04:37.586]  You need to change the standards for construction.
[03:04:38.026 --> 03:04:41.588]  You need to give different rules and regulations to the firemen.
[03:04:41.649 --> 03:04:45.131]  We're still doing it the same way we always did, assuming that this wouldn't happen.
[03:04:45.171 --> 03:04:48.373]  So why haven't you changed the rules for architectural standards?
[03:04:48.433 --> 03:04:50.794]  Why haven't you changed the rules for firemen?
[03:04:51.074 --> 03:04:53.996]  And that's what this NIST scientist is pointing out as well.
[03:04:54.036 --> 03:04:55.457]  See, the truth is going to eventually come out.
[03:04:55.717 --> 03:04:56.097]  Stay with us.
[03:04:56.337 --> 03:04:58.679]  We'll be right back with John Rapoport.
[03:05:01.547 --> 03:05:02.548]  We need to wake people up.
[03:05:02.848 --> 03:05:07.713]  There's still people who have never heard of your show or the alternative media that's out there.
[03:05:07.953 --> 03:05:16.901]  We need to wake up our friends, our neighbors, our relatives, our co-workers, our fellow church congregants, and get them fully informed and fully engaged.
[03:05:18.002 --> 03:05:20.124]  So it's important that you be well prepared.
[03:05:20.164 --> 03:05:21.205]  You need a deep larder.
[03:05:21.666 --> 03:05:24.489]  You need to have those beans, bullets, and band-aids squared away.
[03:05:25.785 --> 03:05:35.211]  I've got to tell you, Alex, I have had a number of consulting clients over the last few months who are telling me that they're preparing to relocate.
[03:05:36.366 --> 03:05:52.997]  This winter, in the dead of winter, they're planning to relocate to places like the American Redoubt, to places like the Cumberland Plateau in eastern Tennessee, to places like the West Texas Hill Country, and places like the Four Corners region.
[03:05:53.778 --> 03:06:02.864]  Even on a modest budget, someone can get squared away with food storage, with water filtration, first aid, with nutraceuticals, the whole works.
[03:06:03.604 --> 03:06:11.930]  On a pretty modest budget, the window of opportunity that we have for strategic relocation is likely to close sometime in the next year.
[03:06:13.010 --> 03:06:20.535]  Because once the system is collapsed, it simply won't be safe to be moving bag and baggage from place to place.
[03:06:21.756 --> 03:06:25.418]  You'll be lucky if you just get out of Dodge with one carload at that point.
[03:06:25.939 --> 03:06:28.981]  Our opportunity exists to relocate
[03:06:30.396 --> 03:06:34.520]  Now, but it may not exist in another six months or 12 months.
[03:06:34.540 --> 03:06:39.565]  It could be reduced to third world living conditions in that period of time.
[03:06:39.625 --> 03:06:48.514]  If they crash the system, they crash the dollar through a credit collapse, then it could be something as simple as raising interest rates by two or three percent.
[03:06:48.834 --> 03:06:51.918]  People should be very selective about
[03:06:52.878 --> 03:06:55.980]  When and where they do their fighting.
[03:06:56.460 --> 03:07:03.424]  People need to, if they're going to be in the public sphere, you need to do so in a way where you can maintain your privacy.
[03:07:03.464 --> 03:07:04.824]  That means letters to the editor.
[03:07:06.025 --> 03:07:09.106]  That means broadside campaigns.
[03:07:10.007 --> 03:07:11.988]  That means micro-broadcasting.
[03:07:12.008 --> 03:07:15.109]  There's all kinds of different things that people can do.
[03:07:15.550 --> 03:07:21.733]  We still have a citizenry that's fairly intelligent, fairly healthy.
[03:07:22.975 --> 03:07:25.337]  Compared to third world standards, we're incredibly healthy.
[03:07:26.417 --> 03:07:32.121]  And we have a citizenry with the means.
[03:07:32.541 --> 03:07:35.583]  We actually have one of the wealthiest societies on the planet.
[03:07:36.263 --> 03:07:39.105]  We have a citizenry with the means to make a difference.
[03:07:39.545 --> 03:07:41.066]  Because we're not starving to death.
[03:07:41.727 --> 03:07:49.152]  If you look at most of the third world despotism that goes on, it's only successful because your average citizen
[03:07:50.153 --> 03:07:54.801]  Is spending 99% of their time just worried about their survival?
[03:07:54.842 --> 03:07:57.527]  Forces of freedom and liberty are on the rise.
[03:07:57.587 --> 03:08:01.093]  The powers that be should be quaking in their boots at this point.
[03:08:10.063 --> 03:08:13.988]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:14.909 --> 03:08:19.814]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:24.705 --> 03:08:26.026]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:26.086 --> 03:08:30.027]  I'm David Knight, and our fourth hour is going to be hosted by John Rapoport.
[03:08:30.047 --> 03:08:33.888]  Of course, John Rapoport is no stranger to the InfoWars audience.
[03:08:33.948 --> 03:08:36.669]  He writes frequent articles for InfoWars.com.
[03:08:37.070 --> 03:08:40.591]  He's worked as a freelance investigative reporter for over 30 years.
[03:08:40.631 --> 03:08:48.534]  He points out in his bio here, since 2000, he's operated largely away from the mainstream because, as he puts it, my research is not friendly to conventional media.
[03:08:49.174 --> 03:08:52.196]  You know, conventional media has not been friendly to him either, or to us.
[03:08:52.756 --> 03:08:54.157]  But the truth will come out.
[03:08:54.658 --> 03:09:02.262]  Just as I said in the last segment, as I was talking about Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, their contribution to this last election.
[03:09:02.643 --> 03:09:11.208]  And now even a former NIST employee is speaking out against the baloney science that has been pushed by that organization for the last 15 years.
[03:09:11.248 --> 03:09:14.951]  He said, hey, I just looked at this stuff in August, and this is nonsense.
[03:09:14.991 --> 03:09:17.012]  This isn't up to our scientific standards.
[03:09:17.452 --> 03:09:20.793]  So, John Rappaport is joining us now, and I'm going to get out of the way and let him host.
[03:09:20.833 --> 03:09:22.713]  His website is NoMoreFakeNews.
[03:09:22.753 --> 03:09:24.134]  Boy, John, that was really prophetic.
[03:09:24.774 --> 03:09:30.436]  You thought of this long before they started this fake meme of fake news, didn't you?
[03:09:31.376 --> 03:09:32.936]  That's a gold website.
[03:09:33.496 --> 03:09:35.377]  I was thinking of suing them.
[03:09:35.857 --> 03:09:40.940]  That's right, you could probably take this and sell it to the Pentagon now for millions of dollars.
[03:09:41.480 --> 03:09:46.303]  They could make it their central site to push their fake news memes.
[03:09:47.003 --> 03:09:48.404]  I'm sure, I'm sure we could.
[03:09:48.444 --> 03:09:50.345]  Yeah, we'll have to see about that.
[03:09:50.365 --> 03:09:52.066]  All right, I'm going to get out of the way and let you host.
[03:09:52.086 --> 03:09:52.946]  Thank you so much, John.
[03:09:53.207 --> 03:09:54.667]  Okay, thank you, thank you.
[03:09:54.727 --> 03:09:55.928]  Good to be here, everybody.
[03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:59.470]  Anderson Cooper, my hero.
[03:10:00.310 --> 03:10:02.391]  Mr. Fake News personified.
[03:10:03.292 --> 03:10:04.413]  Isn't he a great guy?
[03:10:04.533 --> 03:10:05.073]  Incredible.
[03:10:06.329 --> 03:10:12.834]  Interned for two summers with the CIA before he ever got started in the news business.
[03:10:13.794 --> 03:10:14.915]  Two summers, not one.
[03:10:15.596 --> 03:10:17.137]  Went through one, said I like it.
[03:10:17.597 --> 03:10:19.038]  Went back, I like it again.
[03:10:20.259 --> 03:10:23.781]  But I guess I won't go in for a career with the CIA.
[03:10:24.762 --> 03:10:28.645]  But the news, mainstream news.
[03:10:29.548 --> 03:10:33.549]  Last I heard, that was a kind of a CIA operation, isn't it?
[03:10:34.510 --> 03:10:37.431]  Mockingbird, Project Mockingbird, and so on and so forth.
[03:10:38.731 --> 03:10:52.576]  So when Anderson Cooper stands up and says to a Trump team member, you mean it's possible that Donald Trump goes to InfoWars, InfoWars, InfoWars for his news?
[03:10:53.076 --> 03:10:54.156]  This is a terrible thing.
[03:10:54.196 --> 03:10:55.177]  This is a terrible thing.
[03:10:55.957 --> 03:10:58.998]  What is Mr. Fake News Anderson Cooper actually doing?
[03:10:59.747 --> 03:11:04.749]  Well, what he's actually doing is he's trying to defend big news.
[03:11:05.829 --> 03:11:09.851]  He's just saying, don't go there, stay here with us.
[03:11:10.771 --> 03:11:11.672]  We own the news.
[03:11:12.412 --> 03:11:13.432]  Don't go anywhere else.
[03:11:14.373 --> 03:11:15.273]  We have the news.
[03:11:15.313 --> 03:11:23.156]  You might recall, who was that idiot on CNN not long ago who was saying, you the public do not have a right
[03:11:24.412 --> 03:11:29.995]  To read the WikiLeaks emails about Hillary Clinton because that would be illegal.
[03:11:30.696 --> 03:11:30.856]  No.
[03:11:31.756 --> 03:11:43.383]  Instead, you've got to let us read them and then we will tell you what they say and then you will know what we know as we want to give it to you.
[03:11:44.904 --> 03:11:45.444]  Remember that?
[03:11:46.525 --> 03:11:51.128]  Remember that incredible statement that should have turned off, I don't know,
[03:11:52.190 --> 03:11:54.872]  Whatever audience CNN has left.
[03:11:55.972 --> 03:11:57.133]  An incredible statement.
[03:11:57.573 --> 03:12:02.176]  So this is the kind of news outlet that Mr. Fake News Anderson Cooper is defending.
[03:12:03.016 --> 03:12:04.757]  This is CNN.
[03:12:05.818 --> 03:12:07.458]  This is CNN.
[03:12:08.359 --> 03:12:10.800]  Don't go to Infowars.
[03:12:11.461 --> 03:12:14.162]  Don't go to anywhere else.
[03:12:15.103 --> 03:12:16.944]  Just stay with CNN.
[03:12:18.565 --> 03:12:21.186]  You know, he's doing advertising for CNN, basically.
[03:12:21.676 --> 03:12:23.356]  It has nothing to do with anything else.
[03:12:23.976 --> 03:12:38.059]  Except, of course, when he refers to Trump and he says, you mean there's a possibility that the next President of the United States does not accept the conventional official scenario about the 9-11 attacks?
[03:12:39.360 --> 03:12:41.820]  My God, what a horror show that would be!
[03:12:43.080 --> 03:12:45.801]  And why would Mr. Fake News Anderson Cooper say that?
[03:12:45.901 --> 03:12:48.061]  Because he doesn't know the first thing about anything.
[03:12:48.682 --> 03:12:50.562]  All he knows is the official scenario.
[03:12:51.118 --> 03:12:52.539]  That's all he's supposed to know.
[03:12:53.079 --> 03:12:54.739]  That's all he's supposed to talk about.
[03:12:55.220 --> 03:12:57.220]  So that is what he talks about.
[03:12:58.421 --> 03:13:04.703]  And defends that against any incursion from the outside.
[03:13:05.723 --> 03:13:08.304]  What about Building 7, as David was just talking about?
[03:13:09.024 --> 03:13:14.446]  What about bombs inside the buildings exploding simultaneously with the impact?
[03:13:15.067 --> 03:13:18.708]  What about a dozen other scenarios that have been researched?
[03:13:20.310 --> 03:13:26.851]  By people who are not only of goodwill, but are hell-bent on discovering the truth.
[03:13:27.651 --> 03:13:28.291]  What about them?
[03:13:29.052 --> 03:13:30.172]  Oh, that's all fake news.
[03:13:30.612 --> 03:13:31.792]  And why is that, Anderson?
[03:13:32.292 --> 03:13:34.552]  Well, because it's not CNN.
[03:13:34.713 --> 03:13:35.233]  That's why.
[03:13:36.193 --> 03:13:43.974]  And then, of course, we have the case of Newsweek sending out, what was it, 100, 120,000 issues of Madame President, the so-called commemorative issue.
[03:13:49.697 --> 03:13:56.282]  On election night, and now revealing and confessing that they didn't even write it.
[03:13:56.903 --> 03:13:57.724]  They didn't read it.
[03:13:58.244 --> 03:13:59.465]  They didn't edit it.
[03:13:59.525 --> 03:14:00.586]  They didn't look at it.
[03:14:01.667 --> 03:14:05.530]  Matt Cooper, the editor, was talking with Tucker Carlson about this.
[03:14:05.550 --> 03:14:06.731]  Oh yeah, well,
[03:14:07.378 --> 03:14:12.742]  You know, we subcontract that kind of thing out to a private company and usually they do a very good job.
[03:14:12.782 --> 03:14:16.485]  But I have to admit, in this case, the writing was really subpar.
[03:14:16.986 --> 03:14:24.852]  Yes, because the writing basically glorified Hillary Clinton and roundly denounced Donald Trump as the Dark Prince.
[03:14:25.733 --> 03:14:28.115]  That was the commemorative issue that went out.
[03:14:28.876 --> 03:14:29.696]  We made a mistake.
[03:14:29.736 --> 03:14:32.238]  It went out before the election was called.
[03:14:32.318 --> 03:14:32.639]  Yes.
[03:14:33.159 --> 03:14:34.300]  So that was another mistake.
[03:14:34.887 --> 03:14:36.788]  We sent it out, that was one.
[03:14:37.208 --> 03:14:38.648]  We didn't read it, number two.
[03:14:38.688 --> 03:14:40.028]  We didn't edit it, number three.
[03:14:40.188 --> 03:14:41.769]  And we didn't write it, number four.
[03:14:42.349 --> 03:14:48.331]  We actually had a private company do it for us, and they sent it out.
[03:14:50.291 --> 03:14:51.272]  That's a pretty good deal.
[03:14:52.712 --> 03:14:56.573]  You run a news outlet that isn't a news outlet.
[03:14:58.050 --> 03:15:03.194]  You pay somebody else to write the news, you don't read it or you edit it, you just send it out.
[03:15:03.694 --> 03:15:05.696]  That's kind of a nice job if you can get it.
[03:15:06.677 --> 03:15:13.522]  So with that, let me suddenly segue over and let you know that vitamin-mineral fusion
[03:15:14.429 --> 03:15:18.131]  An InfoWarsLife.com product is back.
[03:15:18.751 --> 03:15:19.532]  It's affordable.
[03:15:20.032 --> 03:15:24.714]  It's there in the stores at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:15:25.154 --> 03:15:31.037]  Full month supply of essential vitamins, minerals, amino acids that your body does need.
[03:15:31.958 --> 03:15:33.218]  Unique delivery system.
[03:15:33.779 --> 03:15:36.060]  Proprietary manufacturing process.
[03:15:37.498 --> 03:15:40.719]  Platinum standard of multivitamin products.
[03:15:40.819 --> 03:15:46.820]  So go to infowarslife.com for vitamin mineral fusion.
[03:15:47.900 --> 03:15:53.042]  This product either plant derived or of the highest lab standard.
[03:15:53.722 --> 03:16:06.765]  Just some of the ingredients, ingredients, vitamin C, E, zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine, alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, vitamin mineral fusion,
[03:16:08.118 --> 03:16:17.943]  Infowarslife.com and as David mentioned in the last hour, Infowars does not accept government funding.
[03:16:18.743 --> 03:16:20.204]  It is not PBS.
[03:16:21.045 --> 03:16:24.686]  It is not running Kellogg's ads all over the place.
[03:16:25.587 --> 03:16:26.947]  It is not doing any of that.
[03:16:28.128 --> 03:16:35.912]  It's offering you pure products for your health and that way you get a double.
[03:16:36.809 --> 03:16:40.271]  You get health, better health, and you support InfoWars.
[03:16:41.551 --> 03:16:42.031]  So do it.
[03:16:42.111 --> 03:16:44.632]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:16:46.713 --> 03:16:54.777]  Now, as I was saying, Anderson Cooper, Mr. Fake News, two summers with the CIA as an intern.
[03:16:57.298 --> 03:17:00.119]  But this isn't all that's happening at CNN.
[03:17:00.920 --> 03:17:06.222]  And here's something that I think it's quite possible that you haven't heard of.
[03:17:07.239 --> 03:17:08.680]  Just looking through my notes here.
[03:17:09.260 --> 03:17:11.961]  And that is the case of David Gergen.
[03:17:12.621 --> 03:17:13.581]  You know David Gergen?
[03:17:14.562 --> 03:17:19.043]  I call him David Gargle because he always sounds like he's gargling when he's talking.
[03:17:19.784 --> 03:17:20.924]  David Gergen.
[03:17:22.325 --> 03:17:33.969]  David Gergen is an insider, a real political insider, who's worked on the inside with four presidents, Ford, Nixon, Reagan, Clinton,
[03:17:34.969 --> 03:17:36.090]  Both sides of the aisle.
[03:17:36.630 --> 03:17:41.413]  He is now an elite CNN commentator.
[03:17:41.474 --> 03:17:42.014]  There he is.
[03:17:42.034 --> 03:17:43.255]  Hi, David.
[03:17:44.195 --> 03:17:46.197]  Don't gurgle while I'm talking, please.
[03:17:46.737 --> 03:17:53.161]  But David is also an executive committee member of the Trilateral Commission.
[03:17:53.962 --> 03:17:54.362]  Okay?
[03:17:55.563 --> 03:17:58.105]  He hammered Trump during the campaign.
[03:18:00.603 --> 03:18:02.384]  What do those two things have to do with each other?
[03:18:02.444 --> 03:18:09.469]  Well, the Trilateral Commission is David Rockefeller, is Big New Brzezinski, is globalism personified.
[03:18:11.370 --> 03:18:17.834]  There are 87 members of the Trilateral Commission who live in America, as author Patrick Wood has pointed out.
[03:18:18.334 --> 03:18:23.137]  Obama appointed 11 of the 87 to key posts in his administration.
[03:18:23.829 --> 03:18:45.934]  David Gergen is supposedly an objective commentator for CNN, Fake News Central, and he has been a longtime member of the Executive Committee of the Trilateral Commission, which stands for all the trade treaties, indeed, that are sending jobs like crazy out of the country and throwing people out of work.
[03:18:46.614 --> 03:18:50.775]  He stands for the new economic order of the planet,
[03:18:51.491 --> 03:18:54.052]  Which is the stated aim of the Trilateral Commission.
[03:18:54.812 --> 03:19:05.436]  They want to eradicate all borders and national sovereignty as evidenced by David Rockefeller's own statements in his 2003 memoir.
[03:19:05.456 --> 03:19:08.617]  That's who David Gergen is.
[03:19:09.618 --> 03:19:18.201]  So why doesn't he file and announce a conflict of interest statement every time he opens his yap and gargles on CNN?
[03:19:19.756 --> 03:19:28.461]  Especially when he's talking about globalism, or trade treaties, or Donald Trump, or immigration, or open borders.
[03:19:29.922 --> 03:19:30.843]  Why doesn't he do that?
[03:19:31.223 --> 03:19:32.484]  Why doesn't CNN do that?
[03:19:32.844 --> 03:19:34.865]  Why don't they say, here's David Gergen?
[03:19:36.266 --> 03:19:41.029]  You didn't know this, but he's an executive committee member of the Trilateral Commission.
[03:19:41.810 --> 03:19:46.993]  And so he has certain views, which we will now announce to you before he opens his yap.
[03:19:48.530 --> 03:19:49.032]  We'll be back.
[03:19:49.654 --> 03:19:50.678]  Think about it.
[03:19:50.959 --> 03:19:51.160]  Info.
[03:20:00.899 --> 03:20:13.030]  The first try was the League of Nations, the second try was the United Nations, and the third try is now to make the United Nations the full world government that was intended.
[03:20:13.210 --> 03:20:22.459]  Most of the nations in the United Nations and in the European Union are members of the ruling parties, are members of the Socialist International.
[03:20:22.779 --> 03:20:33.081]  When they start talking about globalism, they try to soften it by talking about, well, we're talking about globalization and about increased trade and cooperation among nations.
[03:20:33.141 --> 03:20:34.801]  No, they're not talking about cooperation.
[03:20:34.821 --> 03:20:47.824]  They're talking about coercion, of building global governance, global institutions that will have world power, legislative, executive, judicial power, military and police power to override nation states.
[03:20:47.944 --> 03:20:51.928]  First of all, to erode and then destroy national sovereignty.
[03:20:52.068 --> 03:21:12.326]  They do not want a United States with a constitutionally limited government being able to, in any way, resist their plans for global governance, which is total takeover of the financial, political, educational, all systems, everything that we rely on as part of our culture and our economy and our government.
[03:21:12.686 --> 03:21:15.147]  They want that to be all under global controls.
[03:21:15.407 --> 03:21:20.229]  They cannot allow us to continue running our own lives.
[03:21:20.549 --> 03:21:23.731]  And that's what national sovereignty, of course, is all about.
[03:21:23.791 --> 03:21:32.534]  And so you see Richard Haass, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Henry Kissinger, constantly attacking national sovereignty.
[03:21:32.574 --> 03:21:42.298]  And they say, as President Obama said in this recent article that you referred to in the New York Times, that, oh, we saw World War I and World War II, all of the
[03:21:42.758 --> 03:21:52.961]  The death and destruction that those conflicts brought to the continent of Europe and to all of the world, it was the result of nations failing to cooperate.
[03:21:53.021 --> 03:21:55.982]  And he said, we don't want to see a repetition of that.
[03:21:56.482 --> 03:22:08.126]  That is the theme of the false narrative that has been given to us in our textbooks and by our world leaders, globalists for the last several generations.
[03:22:09.366 --> 03:22:12.748]  Of course, that isn't true at all.
[03:22:13.329 --> 03:22:17.712]  World War I and World War II were actually initiated by the globalists.
[03:22:17.812 --> 03:22:20.894]  Peter Sutherland, of course, is the ultimate globalist insider.
[03:22:20.934 --> 03:22:39.186]  Goldman Sachs, European Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, all of the organizations, the globalist New World Order, organizations that the establishment media says don't exist or are benign, inconsequential, social mingling groups.
[03:22:39.306 --> 03:22:41.687]  If you look at Bill Clinton,
[03:23:03.653 --> 03:23:04.173]  Far worse.
[03:23:04.413 --> 03:23:06.094]  Minor words and his was action.
[03:23:06.674 --> 03:23:08.215]  His was what he's done to women.
[03:23:08.255 --> 03:23:13.917]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[03:23:14.137 --> 03:23:16.438]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[03:23:16.818 --> 03:23:21.720]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
[03:23:21.800 --> 03:23:22.980]  Four of them here tonight.
[03:23:23.120 --> 03:23:28.422]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[03:23:39.264 --> 03:23:42.007]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[03:23:42.869 --> 03:23:44.330]  It's a fight for our minds.
[03:23:44.991 --> 03:23:46.914]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[03:23:47.254 --> 03:23:51.459]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:23:51.579 --> 03:23:54.944]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[03:23:55.024 --> 03:23:56.566]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:24:01.974 --> 03:24:07.097]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:07.797 --> 03:24:13.840]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:24:18.843 --> 03:24:23.005]  This is John Rappaport sitting in for Alex Jones in the fourth hour here.
[03:24:24.045 --> 03:24:28.928]  And we're talking about fake news and the fake news people of CNN.
[03:24:30.754 --> 03:24:34.895]  But I want to shift gears into some solutions here.
[03:24:36.776 --> 03:24:42.478]  I've been writing open letters to Steve Bannon, suggesting some solutions.
[03:24:43.558 --> 03:24:50.420]  Remember the idea of solutions, actual things that actually work, as opposed to what government bureaucrats do?
[03:24:50.520 --> 03:24:58.583]  Because let's face it, what they do is they take a problem and they grab it like it's their soulmate.
[03:24:59.474 --> 03:25:00.114]  We gotta have it.
[03:25:00.334 --> 03:25:01.335]  We can't let go of it.
[03:25:01.375 --> 03:25:02.175]  We can't solve it.
[03:25:02.215 --> 03:25:03.676]  We can't really do anything about it.
[03:25:03.716 --> 03:25:05.576]  We can mush it around.
[03:25:05.596 --> 03:25:06.577]  We can love it.
[03:25:07.517 --> 03:25:08.398]  And we can keep it.
[03:25:08.578 --> 03:25:16.181]  We can fund it, unworkably, so that everything gets screwed up, but we never, ever solve it.
[03:25:16.541 --> 03:25:18.522]  That's the bureaucratic look here.
[03:25:19.202 --> 03:25:24.564]  So, if Trump is going to change that, if that's really going to happen,
[03:25:25.387 --> 03:25:29.628]  And I have some serious questions about some of his appointments so far.
[03:25:29.788 --> 03:25:32.369]  So I'm not floating in the clouds here.
[03:25:33.149 --> 03:25:44.593]  But if this administration is going to go for solutions, Steve Bannon is one of the guys to talk to because he understands something about major media.
[03:25:44.693 --> 03:25:46.073]  He understands it's a bubble.
[03:25:46.473 --> 03:25:52.835]  He understands they're all talking to each other and they reflect the bureaucracy in the government and they take dictation.
[03:25:53.886 --> 03:25:55.247]  From government PR people.
[03:25:56.167 --> 03:25:58.208]  And he does think outside the box.
[03:25:59.589 --> 03:26:06.632]  So, I want to drum up some support for some of these things because they would revolutionize the country.
[03:26:07.112 --> 03:26:10.314]  These are not my original ideas that I cooked up out of nowhere.
[03:26:11.554 --> 03:26:12.175]  They're there.
[03:26:13.115 --> 03:26:14.476]  They're happening to some degree.
[03:26:14.576 --> 03:26:18.898]  For example, and I've talked to Alex about this before, urban farms.
[03:26:19.818 --> 03:26:24.020]  Go to a search engine and type in Urban Farms Chicago.
[03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:29.962]  And one of the things that's going to come up is actually a directory of urban farms, not just one.
[03:26:30.682 --> 03:26:38.365]  These are in the city of Chicago, some in inner cities where people are growing their own clean, nutritious food.
[03:26:38.525 --> 03:26:39.205]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:26:40.248 --> 03:26:43.029]  Their own clean, nutritious, free food.
[03:26:43.409 --> 03:26:44.269]  Trading food.
[03:26:44.910 --> 03:26:46.970]  This can be turned into a business.
[03:26:47.370 --> 03:26:48.771]  Profitable food as well.
[03:26:48.871 --> 03:26:50.251]  Selling off the excess.
[03:26:50.812 --> 03:26:51.332]  Why not?
[03:26:52.232 --> 03:26:55.093]  Bringing life back to inner cities.
[03:26:55.753 --> 03:27:00.595]  Giving people a stake in their own survival and safe communities.
[03:27:01.495 --> 03:27:05.957]  Escalating their demand to be free of drugs and thugs and bullets.
[03:27:06.949 --> 03:27:09.531]  Because our community is doing something.
[03:27:09.591 --> 03:27:12.194]  We are producing clean, great, nutritious food.
[03:27:12.274 --> 03:27:12.934]  We're eating it.
[03:27:13.495 --> 03:27:14.135]  We're selling it.
[03:27:14.796 --> 03:27:15.436]  We're alive.
[03:27:17.598 --> 03:27:21.321]  What would it take for the federal government to do a loan program?
[03:27:21.722 --> 03:27:28.107]  We're talking about a minuscule amount of the money that's been poured down the rat hole of the war on poverty since 1966.
[03:27:29.629 --> 03:27:30.569]  A tiny amount.
[03:27:31.050 --> 03:27:32.031]  And you could have 5,000 of these.
[03:27:34.939 --> 03:27:37.720]  5,000 of these urban farms in inner cities across America.
[03:27:38.041 --> 03:27:38.621]  Think of that.
[03:27:39.161 --> 03:27:41.582]  Think of that kind of revolution, what that would do.
[03:27:42.042 --> 03:27:48.064]  Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, go outside the box.
[03:27:48.905 --> 03:27:58.528]  Revolutionize the failure of the bureaucracy of government as it becomes more and more of a fungus and invades our lives more and more.
[03:27:59.148 --> 03:28:00.449]  Turn it all around.
[03:28:01.897 --> 03:28:11.941]  Go be around, go be around that bureaucracy and go direct to the people in the inner cities that already know how to do this.
[03:28:11.961 --> 03:28:17.243]  We're not talking about bureaucrats coming in and saying, well, we're going to grow an urban farm.
[03:28:18.943 --> 03:28:28.407]  Not those idiots, the people who live in the inner cities and leaders who already live there, who know how to do urban farming.
[03:28:29.187 --> 03:28:29.847]  They exist.
[03:28:29.967 --> 03:28:37.411]  They're the ones that should be getting the funding, the loans directly to expand their operations, teach other people how to do this.
[03:28:38.111 --> 03:28:46.595]  And I guarantee you, Steve, Donald, that within months you would see a revolution happening in America.
[03:28:47.196 --> 03:28:51.938]  A revolution from the bottom up in America.
[03:28:52.898 --> 03:28:53.859]  That's what you would get.
[03:28:55.091 --> 03:28:56.432]  That's what we're talking about here.
[03:28:56.492 --> 03:28:59.075]  Solutions that go beyond.
[03:28:59.335 --> 03:29:00.336]  Yeah, that's not great.
[03:29:00.396 --> 03:29:04.520]  Look at that on your screen right now if you're watching.
[03:29:05.461 --> 03:29:07.122]  People growing their own food.
[03:29:08.263 --> 03:29:08.984]  It's alive.
[03:29:09.785 --> 03:29:10.706]  It makes you healthy.
[03:29:11.326 --> 03:29:12.367]  It's not Kellogg's.
[03:29:12.808 --> 03:29:13.448]  It's real.
[03:29:14.229 --> 03:29:15.170]  Yes, indeed.
[03:29:16.171 --> 03:29:17.933]  Think about these things, Steve.
[03:29:18.593 --> 03:29:19.274]  Think about
[03:29:20.760 --> 03:29:25.990]  The solutions that work better make people more powerful in their own communities.
[03:29:26.631 --> 03:29:30.738]  John Rappaport sitting in for Alex Jones on InfoWars.
[03:29:30.818 --> 03:29:32.201]  Don't go anywhere, we'll be back.
[03:29:50.292 --> 03:29:53.293]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.213 --> 03:29:57.034]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.195 --> 03:30:02.015]  Breaking news!
[03:30:02.275 --> 03:30:05.276]  California wants to succeed after a Donald Trump victory.
[03:30:05.496 --> 03:30:07.477]  Article up by the Sacramento Bee.
[03:30:07.777 --> 03:30:08.417]  Want to get away?
[03:30:08.597 --> 03:30:12.578]  Cal exits succession plan possible, but faces huge hurdles.
[03:30:12.938 --> 03:30:14.658]  Well, guess what, California?
[03:30:14.758 --> 03:30:16.859]  The rest of America's not your hurdle.
[03:30:17.039 --> 03:30:18.039]  Because we're all for it!
[03:30:18.319 --> 03:30:18.859]  Please!
[03:30:19.140 --> 03:30:19.900]  Leave now!
[03:30:20.160 --> 03:30:36.904]  Let's take all the good people out of there, because there's some good ones down there, and then we'll just dump the rest of Portland, and New York, and Miami, and Austin, and all the liberal hellholes, and we'll just dump them all in California, and we'll even help break away the land and push you guys out in the ocean.
[03:30:37.224 --> 03:30:38.225]  That'd be even better.
[03:30:38.405 --> 03:30:40.485]  You don't even have to have borders, because guess what?
[03:30:40.925 --> 03:30:43.586]  Nobody's gonna want to go there, because that sounds like
[03:30:43.806 --> 03:30:44.967]  Hell on earth.
[03:30:45.307 --> 03:30:52.651]  Now facing Donald Trump's imminent entrance to the Oval Office, the once outlandish idea of succession doesn't seem so crazy anymore to some Californians.
[03:30:52.872 --> 03:30:54.432]  Doesn't sound crazy to me either.
[03:30:54.733 --> 03:30:55.413]  See you later!
[03:30:55.633 --> 03:30:57.674]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com
[03:31:00.896 --> 03:31:04.778]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:05.058 --> 03:31:12.321]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable grape-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[03:31:12.521 --> 03:31:23.646]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[03:31:23.966 --> 03:31:31.511]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[03:31:31.811 --> 03:31:41.137]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[03:31:41.457 --> 03:31:45.639]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[03:31:45.899 --> 03:31:52.642]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[03:31:52.962 --> 03:31:54.062]  That means it's clean.
[03:31:54.422 --> 03:31:55.503]  That means it's pure.
[03:31:55.583 --> 03:31:58.364]  That's infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:31:58.484 --> 03:32:00.165]  Take action now before we sell out.
[03:32:00.885 --> 03:32:05.667]  If you ever wanted to keep your lights on, maybe run emergency appliances when the power goes out.
[03:32:05.907 --> 03:32:08.148]  This could be one of the most important messages you'll ever hear.
[03:32:08.428 --> 03:32:08.988]  Here's why.
[03:32:09.268 --> 03:32:12.330]  There's a new solar generator out that pretty much everyone can afford.
[03:32:12.670 --> 03:32:18.952]  It provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, basically creating your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[03:32:19.172 --> 03:32:19.953]  But here's the key.
[03:32:20.353 --> 03:32:23.094]  It's so small you can put it in your pocket or glove compartment.
[03:32:23.334 --> 03:32:24.334]  Now this is really cool.
[03:32:24.555 --> 03:32:27.636]  Probably one of the best off-the-grid products I've seen in a while.
[03:32:27.796 --> 03:32:30.517]  And you've got to watch some of the crazy videos on this website.
[03:32:30.657 --> 03:32:31.678]  You won't believe your eyes.
[03:32:32.138 --> 03:32:32.919]  A true innovation.
[03:32:33.139 --> 03:32:34.720]  I have never seen anything like this.
[03:32:35.140 --> 03:32:36.901]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[03:32:37.021 --> 03:32:39.183]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[03:32:39.323 --> 03:32:40.104]  And check this out.
[03:32:40.264 --> 03:32:41.725]  You can claim one right now.
[03:32:42.065 --> 03:32:46.668]  Then use the coupon code POWER at checkout and get a second unit free.
[03:32:47.209 --> 03:32:51.912]  Even better, you'll also receive $300 in off-the-grid bonuses, all while supplies last.
[03:32:52.232 --> 03:32:56.295]  Watch all the survival and self-reliance videos at PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[03:32:56.455 --> 03:32:58.337]  Go to PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[03:32:58.497 --> 03:33:00.198]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[03:33:13.869 --> 03:33:21.371]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:33:22.352 --> 03:33:26.233]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:26.693 --> 03:33:30.514]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:33:30.874 --> 03:33:32.495]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:37.111 --> 03:33:40.812]  This is John Rappaport sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour here.
[03:33:40.852 --> 03:33:44.414]  We're talking about solutions for the Trump administration.
[03:33:45.354 --> 03:33:46.875]  Because, why not?
[03:33:47.875 --> 03:33:52.697]  Because we've gotten the message that this is supposed to be different.
[03:33:53.737 --> 03:33:55.918]  This is not the old story of globalism.
[03:33:56.599 --> 03:33:57.399]  This is not
[03:33:58.516 --> 03:34:14.989]  The United States is some kind of a subunit in the greater glob whole of the world, a globalist program to basically put everybody into a condition of hypnosis.
[03:34:16.590 --> 03:34:17.771]  No, this is supposed to be different.
[03:34:17.932 --> 03:34:19.413]  Okay, well, let's assume it is.
[03:34:19.453 --> 03:34:25.758]  Let's assume that maybe somewhere in there, Trump, Steve Bannon, others,
[03:34:26.505 --> 03:34:28.766]  They actually want to do something to change things.
[03:34:28.806 --> 03:34:32.288]  They're interested in actual solutions.
[03:34:32.468 --> 03:34:35.970]  No matter who that offends.
[03:34:36.110 --> 03:34:45.695]  Because, believe me, when you start talking solutions, as I've learned from over 30 years writing as a reporter, you start offending lots of people.
[03:34:46.996 --> 03:34:47.756]  Strange, isn't it?
[03:34:48.376 --> 03:34:49.157]  I mean, why not?
[03:34:50.177 --> 03:34:51.598]  Because they don't want solutions.
[03:34:52.358 --> 03:34:55.380]  Because solutions make them feel too good.
[03:34:55.993 --> 03:34:57.293]  That's really what's going on.
[03:34:58.754 --> 03:35:00.014]  Makes them feel too good.
[03:35:00.815 --> 03:35:01.915]  Makes them have hope again.
[03:35:02.275 --> 03:35:13.919]  Makes them think that we can get around the reality machine that keeps on producing lies, defeat, loss, failure, and actually achieve something.
[03:35:15.520 --> 03:35:16.720]  And they don't want to feel that way.
[03:35:16.760 --> 03:35:17.801]  They don't want to think that way.
[03:35:18.201 --> 03:35:21.282]  They just want to rest in the swamp.
[03:35:23.197 --> 03:35:26.138]  Along with the other creatures of the night.
[03:35:26.978 --> 03:35:28.078]  That's what they want to do.
[03:35:28.659 --> 03:35:30.739]  And bureaucrats are famous for this.
[03:35:31.639 --> 03:35:33.380]  Government people are famous for this.
[03:35:34.180 --> 03:35:34.760]  Solution?
[03:35:35.080 --> 03:35:37.541]  Oh man, that's like a silver bullet to a vampire.
[03:35:37.861 --> 03:35:39.001]  Something that actually works?
[03:35:39.061 --> 03:35:39.622]  No, no, no.
[03:35:40.042 --> 03:35:46.384]  For example, we have a water shortage in California and many other places around the globe.
[03:35:47.004 --> 03:35:47.844]  A severe drought.
[03:35:48.644 --> 03:35:53.765]  No matter what's causing it, no matter, and I understand there are many explanations for what's behind it.
[03:35:54.085 --> 03:35:55.085]  What about solving it?
[03:35:56.526 --> 03:35:58.086]  What about actually solving it?
[03:35:58.866 --> 03:36:16.150]  What about a guy named Minaj Bhargava, who puts out five-hour energy, and has many inventions that his teams of technicians around the world are working on as we speak, including making it rain, so to speak.
[03:36:16.770 --> 03:36:17.010]  Well,
[03:36:17.734 --> 03:36:26.920]  Basically, what he's talking about are machines that desalinate water to various degrees of purity, including complete distillation.
[03:36:27.580 --> 03:36:29.021]  A barge, for example.
[03:36:29.061 --> 03:36:33.163]  You see that big barge, those of you who are watching, carrying huge tanks.
[03:36:34.104 --> 03:36:37.706]  Each one of these tanks may be the size of a flatbed truck.
[03:36:38.487 --> 03:36:43.890]  And the water is purified or desalinated from seawater at sea.
[03:36:44.910 --> 03:36:58.381]  And then it can be brought to land, it can be pumped into California, it can be sold to farmers who are going out of business like crazy because their profit margins already are small and they can't get enough water.
[03:36:59.742 --> 03:37:01.244]  Why hasn't California thought of this?
[03:37:01.944 --> 03:37:03.866]  What about Governor Moonbeam?
[03:37:04.526 --> 03:37:05.267]  Jerry Brown?
[03:37:05.307 --> 03:37:07.148]  Why hasn't he considered any of this?
[03:37:07.709 --> 03:37:10.812]  Why hasn't the California bureaucracy considered any of this?
[03:37:10.872 --> 03:37:11.592]  Well, we don't care.
[03:37:12.373 --> 03:37:13.474]  What about solving this?
[03:37:15.137 --> 03:37:19.500]  President-elect Steve, what about getting busy and talking to this guy?
[03:37:19.540 --> 03:37:20.801]  You can check his system out.
[03:37:21.122 --> 03:37:21.942]  It's all there.
[03:37:22.363 --> 03:37:23.644]  If it works, it works.
[03:37:24.244 --> 03:37:32.030]  If it works, you can put Minaj together with California farmers and actually give them water.
[03:37:32.290 --> 03:37:33.151]  What an idea!
[03:37:33.991 --> 03:37:35.132]  What an idea!
[03:37:35.312 --> 03:37:36.593]  Give them water.
[03:37:37.674 --> 03:37:38.215]  Incredible.
[03:37:38.235 --> 03:37:41.077]  That's called an answer.
[03:37:41.949 --> 03:37:45.170]  But of course, you see, let's just keep this in mind.
[03:37:46.731 --> 03:38:02.577]  The people who are in charge of the fraudulent climate change science that say, you know, we were all going to be dead by now, but now they've moved it up to whatever it is, 2040, 2050, all this fraudulent science.
[03:38:03.637 --> 03:38:07.399]  They are relying on droughts and water shortages.
[03:38:08.274 --> 03:38:12.037]  To say, you see, this is all caused by man-made global warming.
[03:38:12.077 --> 03:38:22.365]  They want to shove that in our faces and say, this is proof that the planet is going to hell unless we save it by cutting back on everybody's energy consumption.
[03:38:23.687 --> 03:38:24.487]  That's their game.
[03:38:25.348 --> 03:38:26.249]  That's what they're doing.
[03:38:26.689 --> 03:38:31.353]  That's why they want these droughts and water shortages to persist.
[03:38:33.615 --> 03:38:36.597]  We, on the other hand, can demand solutions.
[03:38:36.677 --> 03:38:37.618]  That's what we want.
[03:38:38.942 --> 03:38:39.542]  Mr. Trump.
[03:38:40.282 --> 03:38:42.723]  Solutions that actually work.
[03:38:44.484 --> 03:38:50.286]  Bypass the morons and the criminals in the system that refuse to make things work.
[03:38:52.087 --> 03:38:54.267]  And solve the water shortage.
[03:38:55.708 --> 03:39:00.029]  Another product from Infowarslife.com.
[03:39:00.470 --> 03:39:02.570]  You heard Alex talking about it a few minutes ago.
[03:39:02.630 --> 03:39:07.152]  I just want to reinforce it because it's called DNA Force.
[03:39:08.453 --> 03:39:13.675]  The benefits of the most advanced formula that InfoWars has ever produced.
[03:39:14.275 --> 03:39:16.215]  BioPQQ.
[03:39:17.036 --> 03:39:19.016]  That's the patented compound.
[03:39:19.696 --> 03:39:22.357]  Backed up by 175 clinical studies.
[03:39:23.598 --> 03:39:27.699]  The product, that ingredient in particular, extremely hard to secure.
[03:39:29.539 --> 03:39:31.740]  So get it while it is there.
[03:39:32.651 --> 03:39:40.734]  Just one of the nine powerful ingredients in DNA Force, including CoQ10 and digestive enzymes.
[03:39:42.055 --> 03:39:54.520]  There's a reason why just one ingredient in DNA Force costs about $30,000 per batch to produce, because the product is complex and hard to produce.
[03:39:55.280 --> 03:39:59.382]  So when InfoWars runs out, they're going to be out of stock for a while.
[03:39:59.482 --> 03:40:01.123]  So go to InfoWarsLife.com
[03:40:02.811 --> 03:40:05.893]  And check out and order DNA Force.
[03:40:06.513 --> 03:40:08.775]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:40:09.255 --> 03:40:19.321]  Keep in mind that your support through these products, which benefit you, make InfoWars.com possible.
[03:40:21.102 --> 03:40:21.822]  Solutions.
[03:40:22.423 --> 03:40:23.844]  Many solutions here.
[03:40:25.845 --> 03:40:27.866]  Let's think about, for example,
[03:40:30.313 --> 03:40:32.595]  The Trump Web Network.
[03:40:33.416 --> 03:40:34.517]  That's what I would call it.
[03:40:35.397 --> 03:40:36.858]  He's already started to do this.
[03:40:37.699 --> 03:40:42.403]  In one of my open letters to Steve Bannon, I said, look, Trump has to go direct to the people.
[03:40:43.264 --> 03:40:46.326]  With live stream, actually, is the way he should be doing this.
[03:40:47.627 --> 03:40:48.128]  On the web.
[03:40:49.869 --> 03:40:50.830]  Forget the major media.
[03:40:51.667 --> 03:41:00.409]  Doesn't have to do press conferences with these idiots who are the purveyors and originators of fake news par excellence.
[03:41:02.229 --> 03:41:05.930]  Deny them press passes or just ignore them completely.
[03:41:06.550 --> 03:41:15.652]  Sitting in the Trump Tower, sitting in the White House, talk directly to the people through live streaming video on the web.
[03:41:16.612 --> 03:41:18.693]  He's already put up a couple of YouTube videos.
[03:41:19.662 --> 03:41:21.163]  Which is a step in the right direction.
[03:41:21.503 --> 03:41:48.175]  But the basic idea here is that this in itself is a solution because if, if he is what he says he is, a real populist in the sense of raising people up, giving the people who put him in office what they truly want, if this is the agenda and not some of these very questionable
[03:41:49.266 --> 03:42:11.422]  appointments he's making, then he should be going directly to the people often and at length to tell them what he is doing to bring these wishes into being, these solutions into being, and what resistance he is encountering on a daily basis, naming names.
[03:42:12.403 --> 03:42:15.285]  This is the way you do it in the era of the new media.
[03:42:16.766 --> 03:42:18.848]  This is how you keep the people informed.
[03:42:21.604 --> 03:42:24.165]  Who cares how many press conferences the President has?
[03:42:24.185 --> 03:42:27.806]  He doesn't have to inform the people that way.
[03:42:28.386 --> 03:42:47.531]  So get busy, Bannon, and put up the Trump Web Network where the people are going to be able to hear and respond to what the Elect President is going to tell them about what he is doing to bring his authentic, non-globalist program into being.
[03:42:48.658 --> 03:42:50.540]  That's what we want to see.
[03:42:51.100 --> 03:42:54.203]  That's what we want to find out about now.
[03:42:56.765 --> 03:42:58.927]  And here's another solution, Mr. Bannon.
[03:43:01.329 --> 03:43:05.312]  I've talked about this for some years, written about it.
[03:43:07.194 --> 03:43:13.219]  It has to do with people who were and still are in the movement called Health Freedom.
[03:43:14.309 --> 03:43:18.130]  This is no tiny proportion of the population, Mr. Bannon, I assure you.
[03:43:18.571 --> 03:43:35.256]  There are millions and millions of people out there who got up on their hind legs in the early 1990s when the FDA was threatening to take away their nutritional supplements and when the FDA was raiding alternative practitioners' offices like Dr. Jonathan Wright in the state of Washington.
[03:43:35.897 --> 03:43:36.657]  And they wrote
[03:43:37.355 --> 03:43:39.476]  This was not email era.
[03:43:39.957 --> 03:43:48.422]  They wrote actual letters to Congress demanding their health freedom, which is the right to manage their own health and their own bodies.
[03:43:49.423 --> 03:43:51.765]  Millions of letters to Congress.
[03:43:51.905 --> 03:43:55.907]  More than Congress had ever received on any issue in its history.
[03:43:56.388 --> 03:43:59.009]  And those people are still there, Mr. Bannon.
[03:43:59.570 --> 03:44:00.330]  They're still there.
[03:44:00.731 --> 03:44:02.552]  Some of them voted for your guy.
[03:44:03.412 --> 03:44:04.213]  Some of them didn't.
[03:44:04.333 --> 03:44:05.654]  Some of them didn't vote at all.
[03:44:06.317 --> 03:44:13.663]  But they're still there and they are, believe me, a potent force for change in the right direction.
[03:44:14.303 --> 03:44:15.404]  So here's a solution.
[03:44:15.424 --> 03:44:16.104]  Think about it.
[03:44:17.365 --> 03:44:35.179]  Encourage, wangle, wheedle, whatever you have to do to find one state in the Union that will pass a law that says that any health practitioner of any stripe can practice in that state.
[03:44:36.994 --> 03:44:47.301]  As long as he or she does not use a remedy for a condition that is more toxic than the standard medical remedy for that condition.
[03:44:47.761 --> 03:44:48.642]  That's the only rule.
[03:44:49.683 --> 03:44:58.749]  Otherwise, you're talking about informed consent between adults, patient and practitioner.
[03:44:59.849 --> 03:45:01.631]  Any kind of health practice at all.
[03:45:03.412 --> 03:45:03.992]  Think about that.
[03:45:04.012 --> 03:45:06.534]  Do you have any inkling about what that could do?
[03:45:07.668 --> 03:45:13.370]  To the economy of that state, pick a state, South Carolina, Florida, whatever.
[03:45:14.350 --> 03:45:36.996]  You would have huge numbers of people, both practitioners, clients, patients, migrating to that state with money, ready to spend it, ready to put it in circulation because these people want their health freedom and they believe they have the right and they do, as do we all, to manage their own health in any way that they want to.
[03:45:37.987 --> 03:45:43.592]  That state would undergo an incredible economic boom overnight.
[03:45:45.333 --> 03:45:47.796]  And other states looking at that would see it.
[03:45:48.636 --> 03:45:50.578]  And they would follow suit as well.
[03:45:51.999 --> 03:46:04.470]  And in that way, you would crack the pharmaceutical medical monopoly in this country and put the economy up onto an even higher level than it was before.
[03:46:06.192 --> 03:46:19.439]  And if the President-elect managed to pull that one off as a solution, just as a side effect, he would have millions more people supporting him.
[03:46:20.219 --> 03:46:26.322]  Millions more that are now, most of them, nowhere to be seen.
[03:46:27.343 --> 03:46:28.663]  They would come out of the woodwork.
[03:46:30.144 --> 03:46:32.505]  So that's another answer, another solution.
[03:46:32.525 --> 03:46:34.146]  You see what we're talking about here?
[03:46:37.210 --> 03:46:44.937]  It's the people who recognize that there are ways of, God forbid, solving problems.
[03:46:46.658 --> 03:46:47.659]  Making things better.
[03:46:50.662 --> 03:47:00.050]  Not the fake change, not the fake hope, not the fake globalist shimmy-shammy, shuck-and-jive, con game.
[03:47:00.851 --> 03:47:01.631]  But the real thing.
[03:47:02.812 --> 03:47:03.413]  The real thing.
[03:47:05.399 --> 03:47:28.010]  When you put in a real solution and you solve a real problem that has been affecting and infecting a sector of the society, not only do you solve the problem, but people start to wake up to the possibility of real solutions which they've lost track of because government has not been doling those out.
[03:47:29.131 --> 03:47:30.011]  Just the opposite.
[03:47:31.081 --> 03:47:37.104]  Government, as we all know, has been peddling dependence as the highest possible value.
[03:47:38.465 --> 03:47:40.946]  Your life as an individual has no meaning.
[03:47:42.667 --> 03:47:43.708]  You have no power.
[03:47:44.848 --> 03:47:46.309]  You have no creativity.
[03:47:46.829 --> 03:47:49.651]  You have no freedom or independence, not really.
[03:47:50.671 --> 03:47:53.913]  We gave that to you, and we can take it away.
[03:47:54.964 --> 03:48:18.252]  And now we know, because all the sociologists and the academic dome heads and the Anderson Coopers and the David Gergens of this world have covertly assured us, that globalism, the interdependence of everybody on everybody else, you know, is the only thing that the future holds for everybody.
[03:48:18.292 --> 03:48:21.173]  In order for that to happen, you have to give up your individuality.
[03:48:21.714 --> 03:48:22.974]  That's the great obstruction.
[03:48:24.480 --> 03:48:25.821]  You have to stop being you.
[03:48:26.701 --> 03:48:28.482]  You have to admit that you were never you.
[03:48:28.522 --> 03:48:30.944]  That was always just some kind of a delusion, you see.
[03:48:32.304 --> 03:48:40.549]  So when Infowars says 2016 is 1776, they're not just blowing smoke.
[03:48:41.009 --> 03:48:46.953]  They are referring you back to a fundamental principle on which this country was based.
[03:48:47.013 --> 03:48:52.576]  If you look at the founding documents and read a little bit between the lines, just a little bit,
[03:48:53.237 --> 03:49:11.967]  The whole idea was to create a government that would be so severely limited that the individual would be liberated to follow, pursue his or her own vision of happiness, the future, and actually make it happen.
[03:49:13.348 --> 03:49:14.368]  Actually make it happen.
[03:49:15.289 --> 03:49:17.650]  That's called individual power.
[03:49:18.090 --> 03:49:18.951]  That's what that is.
[03:49:19.731 --> 03:49:20.972]  Individual power.
[03:49:22.228 --> 03:49:27.550]  And that's another one of those words that's like a silver bullet to the vampires.
[03:49:28.510 --> 03:49:31.531]  The term individual power, my God, we have to destroy that!
[03:49:32.071 --> 03:49:32.791]  We have to kill it!
[03:49:32.891 --> 03:49:33.491]  Kill it off!
[03:49:33.551 --> 03:49:34.092]  Kill it off!
[03:49:34.832 --> 03:49:36.072]  In favor of the collective.
[03:49:36.952 --> 03:49:43.394]  Let us all hover under the great dome of sameness.
[03:49:44.655 --> 03:49:51.857]  You are number 367A, I am number 367B in the great beehive of the future.
[03:49:52.737 --> 03:49:54.559]  That's where the globalists are going, folks.
[03:49:55.679 --> 03:49:57.881]  That is exactly where they're going.
[03:49:58.762 --> 03:50:18.657]  And real solutions derail that whole effort and put the individual back where he belongs, in charge, with his own intelligence, with his own rationality, with his own mind, with his own logic, with his own creativity, with his own power.
[03:50:19.738 --> 03:50:20.699]  That's what's happening.
[03:50:21.647 --> 03:50:23.247]  That's where we need to go.
[03:50:24.227 --> 03:50:29.448]  That's the movement many of whom coalesced around Donald Trump.
[03:50:30.589 --> 03:50:32.549]  That movement is bigger than anybody.
[03:50:33.749 --> 03:50:35.369]  Doesn't matter who he or she is.
[03:50:36.830 --> 03:50:50.472]  And whoever represents at any given moment that movement better be aware that we are aware and we know whether or not things are on the side of liberation or destruction.
[03:50:52.631 --> 03:50:53.454]  That's the story.
[03:50:54.617 --> 03:50:56.222]  That's what the movement is all about.
[03:50:57.245 --> 03:50:59.532]  That's why we need a solution.
[03:51:05.137 --> 03:51:11.360]  You know, do we, getting so close to this problem, Matt, not telegraph to people?
[03:51:11.400 --> 03:51:12.921]  Like I said earlier, this isn't rhetoric.
[03:51:13.481 --> 03:51:14.982]  I mean, it just gets more and more obvious.
[03:51:15.022 --> 03:51:22.285]  We have people running the country that literally hate prosperity because their systems of command and control can't compete with it.
[03:51:22.946 --> 03:51:24.426]  What else is on your big board?
[03:51:24.486 --> 03:51:25.527]  What else are you looking for?
[03:51:26.227 --> 03:51:27.268]  How do we get aggressive?
[03:51:46.267 --> 03:51:47.368]  We're good to go.
[03:52:06.786 --> 03:52:09.707]  The old media is trying to call it the alt-right media.
[03:52:10.768 --> 03:52:12.108]  I call it just the new media.
[03:52:12.188 --> 03:52:13.769]  I would say the new media is better.
[03:52:13.969 --> 03:52:31.296]  Right now, what the old media is trying to do is to conflate Breitbart, this jackwad, Mr. Spencer, who has a following that could meet in a hotel room, but the old mainstream media
[03:52:31.736 --> 03:52:32.037]  I think so.
[03:52:47.381 --> 03:52:53.946]  When a lightbulb, right before it pops and goes out, it gets real bright and starts flickering and acting crazy.
[03:52:53.986 --> 03:52:54.827]  Have you ever noticed that?
[03:52:54.847 --> 03:52:55.067]  Yes.
[03:52:55.087 --> 03:52:56.889]  You know, an old filament lightbulb?
[03:52:57.609 --> 03:53:08.438]  I think that the mainstream media and the Democrats, George Soros, the Democrats, mainstream media, they realize they've got until, you know, December 19th.
[03:53:08.458 --> 03:53:10.280]  Yeah, why is he still walking around?
[03:53:11.556 --> 03:53:12.697]  Yeah, it's a good question.
[03:53:12.777 --> 03:53:18.640]  Well, for one thing, he's probably extremely well-guarded and very careful and moves only on his own private jets.
[03:53:19.100 --> 03:53:35.169]  But it's very interesting to see what's going to happen after Trump is in and he's got the reins of power because they do appear to be going for broke and just piling the... They're throwing gasoline on a bonfire right now, basically whipping up hatred against cops.
[03:53:35.649 --> 03:53:45.278]  They're still going with the hands up, don't shoot false narratives, which is a lie, which led to a lot of the anger, the whole BLM movement, based on a lie.
[03:53:45.778 --> 03:53:48.921]  Same thing with Trayvon Martin, based on a lie.
[03:53:49.401 --> 03:53:53.945]  So they're obviously, I guess you would call them psychological arsonists.
[03:53:53.965 --> 03:53:57.509]  The media and the Democrats, George Soros, they're all on the same team.
[03:54:09.304 --> 03:54:13.527]  Okay, John Rappaport here, sitting in for Alex in the fourth hour.
[03:54:14.167 --> 03:54:15.568]  This is our last segment.
[03:54:17.429 --> 03:54:19.010]  We're talking about solutions.
[03:54:19.531 --> 03:54:20.451]  Real things.
[03:54:20.792 --> 03:54:21.912]  Or real people.
[03:54:22.092 --> 03:54:22.533]  Why not?
[03:54:24.354 --> 03:54:32.479]  So, let me title this brief segment as we wrap up here, Draining the Pharmaceutical Swamp.
[03:54:34.421 --> 03:54:37.903]  And, uh, I don't know whether Trump or Bannon
[03:54:38.732 --> 03:54:43.274]  Or any of the Inside Court team has looked at this, but they better.
[03:54:43.854 --> 03:54:44.254]  They better.
[03:54:45.355 --> 03:54:46.955]  I've been writing about it for a long time.
[03:54:49.336 --> 03:55:00.861]  July 26, 2000, Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Barbara Starfield, who at the time was a revered public health expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.
[03:55:01.561 --> 03:55:06.443]  So everybody's mainstream credentials up and down the line were meticulous.
[03:55:08.160 --> 03:55:10.121]  Wrote a review called, Is U.S.
[03:55:10.141 --> 03:55:11.822]  Health Really the Best in the World?
[03:55:12.562 --> 03:55:14.523]  Conclusion, the U.S.
[03:55:14.603 --> 03:55:18.485]  medical system kills every year 225,000 people.
[03:55:18.705 --> 03:55:22.447]  That's right.
[03:55:24.268 --> 03:55:33.732]  That would be, if you want to extrapolate it out to a decade, 2.25 million people killed every decade by the U.S.
[03:55:33.912 --> 03:55:35.213]  medical system.
[03:55:36.980 --> 03:55:42.221]  About half of those with FDA-approved pharmaceutical drugs.
[03:55:43.322 --> 03:55:47.002]  The rest, mistreatment and errors in hospitals.
[03:55:49.423 --> 03:55:56.405]  So this is a colossal death march that just keeps on going.
[03:55:57.465 --> 03:55:59.265]  Not going to read about it in major media.
[03:55:59.285 --> 03:56:00.786]  They're not going to talk about it.
[03:56:00.826 --> 03:56:01.886]  They're all sold out.
[03:56:01.966 --> 03:56:02.986]  They're in partnership.
[03:56:03.006 --> 03:56:05.807]  They're part of the pharmaceutical cartel.
[03:56:07.284 --> 03:56:13.029]  But I'm pointing it out because it's murder.
[03:56:14.370 --> 03:56:15.651]  It's been going on forever.
[03:56:16.091 --> 03:56:20.695]  No president dares to touch it, or even talk about it, or even think about it.
[03:56:21.595 --> 03:56:22.696]  Ditto for Congress.
[03:56:23.437 --> 03:56:28.200]  Ditto for the FDA, who is basically responsible for it.
[03:56:30.042 --> 03:56:30.222]  Yeah.
[03:56:33.972 --> 03:56:37.295]  225,000 people killed every year by the U.S.
[03:56:37.355 --> 03:56:38.055]  medical system.
[03:56:40.517 --> 03:56:56.610]  So, when Trump says that he wants to appoint somebody to head the FDA who's going to speed along approval of pharmaceutical drugs, from a business point of view, I understand his thinking.
[03:56:57.851 --> 03:57:00.773]  From a correct point of view, no.
[03:57:00.993 --> 03:57:01.253]  Uh-uh.
[03:57:01.554 --> 03:57:01.774]  Uh-uh.
[03:57:03.129 --> 03:57:06.931]  You have to turn that around and realize what's actually been happening.
[03:57:07.311 --> 03:57:21.318]  The FDA, who is the only agency in the country tasked with approving drugs as safe and effective, are approving drugs as safe and effective that are killing millions of people in America and have been for a very long time.
[03:57:22.779 --> 03:57:23.759]  That's the reality.
[03:57:25.080 --> 03:57:26.601]  That's what needs solving.
[03:57:27.261 --> 03:57:29.502]  That's the swamp that needs to be drained.
[03:57:30.074 --> 03:57:40.458]  The FDA and the pharmaceutical companies who manufacture the drugs do the fake studies that claim that the drugs are safe when they're killing millions of people.
[03:57:41.198 --> 03:57:42.439]  You want to drain a swamp?
[03:57:42.959 --> 03:57:49.041]  You drain that one and you will see life in America suddenly take an upsurge.
[03:57:50.422 --> 03:57:57.864]  Because, I mean, aside from the people who are killed, aside from the people who are maimed, it's a horror show.
[03:57:59.125 --> 03:57:59.245]  All.
[03:58:00.336 --> 03:58:00.956]  Keep blowing.
[03:58:02.417 --> 03:58:04.918]  Thank you for being with me the last hour.
[03:58:04.978 --> 03:58:05.718]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:58:06.158 --> 03:58:07.959]  Always great to be here on InfoWars.
[03:58:08.919 --> 03:58:17.202]  Signing off, stay with InfoWars.
[03:58:41.542 --> 03:58:43.387]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:45.071 --> 03:58:47.276]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.474 --> 03:59:04.037]  Well, Barack Obama is looking pretty stupid right now as a video has surfaced where he is seen making fun of Donald Trump for promising to stop jobs leaving the country.
[03:59:04.217 --> 03:59:05.697]  He's going to bring all these jobs back.
[03:59:05.978 --> 03:59:07.378]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that?
[03:59:07.398 --> 03:59:08.598]  What are you going to do?
[03:59:09.178 --> 03:59:10.039]  There's no answer to it.
[03:59:10.299 --> 03:59:13.459]  He just says, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[03:59:13.779 --> 03:59:16.240]  Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[03:59:16.360 --> 03:59:17.740]  What magic wand do you have?
[03:59:18.100 --> 03:59:19.741]  And usually the answer is,
[03:59:20.641 --> 03:59:21.882]  He doesn't have an answer.
[03:59:53.406 --> 03:59:56.031]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
