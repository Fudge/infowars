[00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:26.687]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:37.775]  I want to be a trillion percent clear.
[00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:45.099]  The globalists have launched their great offensive.
[00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:48.742]  Everything is going to accelerate from this point.
[00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.210]  And we've run out of time.
[00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:55.031]  These are not probes.
[00:00:56.752 --> 00:00:57.832]  They're not testing anymore.
[00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:00.372]  They're dropping the hammer.
[00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:05.153]  The hammer has already fallen.
[00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:11.215]  And the sparks are beginning to fly.
[00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:19.617]  As they attempt to beat the once free republics of the west into a weapon system to carry out the extermination
[00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:24.189]  Of the majority of this planet's population.
[00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:29.673]  And it hit me.
[00:01:30.314 --> 00:01:30.834]  This morning.
[00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:38.759]  I have never been more... Shaken isn't the word.
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.603]  More... Gripped.
[00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:46.324]  By the understanding.
[00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:47.665]  And the sorrow.
[00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:50.007]  And the grief.
[00:01:55.461 --> 00:02:15.637]  That my fellow countrymen, my fellow humans, have willfully turned themselves over spiritually, culturally, metaphysically, to the apparatus of tyranny.
[00:02:15.757 --> 00:02:18.359]  The common sense to stand against it.
[00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:23.884]  The shreds of honor is all we need to stop this.
[00:02:25.572 --> 00:02:41.121]  But the lapdog nature, the cowardly nature of the corporate henchmen that pose as reporters, that pose as journalists, is going to deliver us into a nightmare scenario.
[00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:49.546]  And we're already in a nightmare scenario, but it is going to absolutely spiral out of control now.
[00:02:50.839 --> 00:03:07.963]  And you can even see the rotting evil globalists that are running it falling apart in front of our very eyes as they stoke the flames of the funeral pyre that is meant to disintegrate humanity.
[00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:10.843]  These people are committed to evil.
[00:03:13.204 --> 00:03:19.305]  And then I look at the news and I look at what's happening and I juxtapose it to Donald Trump
[00:03:20.475 --> 00:03:25.858]  Going to Mexico and saying, let's fight globalism and the New World Order together that have been looting our nations.
[00:03:25.878 --> 00:03:26.679]  Let's work together.
[00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.421]  It isn't that Donald Trump listens to what I have to say.
[00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:33.103]  It isn't that Donald Trump's synced with Alex Jones.
[00:03:33.263 --> 00:03:37.126]  He is synced to the spirit of resistance.
[00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:41.068]  We're tuned into the same historical understanding.
[00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:44.090]  I said on air yesterday, no one knows what he's going to say in Mexico.
[00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.052]  I said, I would say let's battle globalism together.
[00:03:49.824 --> 00:03:50.504]  And that's what he did.
[00:03:53.746 --> 00:03:55.367]  Unbelievable.
[00:03:57.708 --> 00:04:01.670]  And you can just see God giving us this last chance with Donald Trump.
[00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.333]  Undoubtedly, Donald Trump has been heaven sent.
[00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:14.237]  And that's why the system is frothing in fear.
[00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.754]  So for all the bad things that are happening, a lot of good is happening as well.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:41.392]  And all I can tell you is our worst analysis of the globalist plan wasn't as bad as it actually is.
[00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:49.516]  And I'm telling the media and everybody else that sold out to this system, you people are out of your minds.
[00:04:50.336 --> 00:04:52.557]  Where is your discernment, your gut?
[00:04:53.698 --> 00:04:58.120]  I mean, you think you're gonna ally with this and you're gonna be winners?
[00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:02.402]  Oh my God!
[00:05:03.402 --> 00:05:05.983]  This is the greatest evil the planet has ever faced.
[00:05:07.544 --> 00:05:09.205]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:12.793]  Folks, the message is clear.
[00:05:13.173 --> 00:05:14.394]  The parallels are there.
[00:05:14.674 --> 00:05:25.564]  There are millions of ordinary Americans who've been let down, who've had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington are detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives
[00:05:26.124 --> 00:05:30.227]  are politically correct parts of that liberal media elite.
[00:05:30.588 --> 00:05:37.713]  They feel people aren't standing up for them and they've actually in many cases given up on the whole electoral process.
[00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:43.638]  And I think, I think that you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign.
[00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:44.899]  You can go out.
[00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:46.781]  You can beat the pollsters.
[00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:49.122]  You can beat the commentators.
[00:05:49.563 --> 00:05:50.804]  You can beat Washington.
[00:05:51.144 --> 00:05:55.745]  Mr. Farage, you just recently resigned as the head of UKIP, still in the EU Parliament.
[00:05:56.286 --> 00:05:56.626]  Wow!
[00:05:56.666 --> 00:05:58.726]  Talk about a David versus Goliath story.
[00:05:59.066 --> 00:06:00.347]  This is epic.
[00:06:00.367 --> 00:06:00.787]  Well, it is.
[00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:07.069]  I think the point about Brexit, Alex, is Brexit is the first victory against this phenomenon.
[00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:27.535]  Of the big banks, the big businesses, effectively owning politics, literally willfully destroying nation-state democracy, getting rid of that thing that our forebears actually fought and shed their blood to create and to preserve, our liberties, our freedoms, all of that being taken away and suddenly
[00:06:28.175 --> 00:06:32.718]  Suddenly, in a referendum that no one said we could win.
[00:06:32.798 --> 00:06:37.840]  I mean literally, nobody thought Brexit would succeed and we've done it.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:45.124]  Hillary represents everything that has gone wrong in our lives in the last couple of decades.
[00:06:45.644 --> 00:06:48.486]  She is part, you know, of that class of people.
[00:06:49.233 --> 00:06:58.601]  Who have taken us into an endless series of foreign wars that I think arguably have made things worse, certainly in Liberia and elsewhere, not better.
[00:06:59.442 --> 00:07:01.023]  She is part of that phenomenon.
[00:07:01.718 --> 00:07:05.581]  Where all that seems to matter now is corporatism.
[00:07:05.941 --> 00:07:13.747]  You know, the big global companies who want to set the rule books to effectively put out of business small and medium-sized competitors.
[00:07:14.248 --> 00:07:23.395]  They have destroyed, you know, what I believe to be proper free market capitalism where your eye can go and set up a company, you know, and have a real chance of succeeding.
[00:07:23.935 --> 00:07:33.003]  And they've presided over a period where the rich have got richer, and where ordinary, decent, working people have seen their living standards deteriorate.
[00:07:33.363 --> 00:07:35.085]  She represents failure.
[00:07:35.305 --> 00:07:42.631]  And she, of course, is completely unreconciled to the vote on Brexit, because Hillary loves the European Union.
[00:07:42.992 --> 00:07:48.997]  I think she sees the European Union as a prototype for an even bigger form of world government.
[00:07:49.157 --> 00:07:50.318]  But let me make it clear.
[00:07:51.107 --> 00:08:05.418]  If you want nothing to change at all, if you want to continue with the kind of cronyism that we see with the Clinton Foundation and everything else, if you want things to stay the same, you vote for Hillary.
[00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:10.022]  I wouldn't vote for Hillary if she paid me, and I feel pretty strongly about that.
[00:08:24.773 --> 00:08:29.196]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.761]  Hollywood Babylon.
[00:08:39.702 --> 00:08:41.523]  This is Babylon, make no mistake.
[00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:46.586]  Babylon will fall in one hour.
[00:08:46.606 --> 00:08:50.428]  Not gonna whole system fall in one hour.
[00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:54.699]  Computers, my friends.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.001]  That's some interesting science fiction from 2,000 years ago.
[00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:05.542]  Or is it?
[00:09:06.682 --> 00:09:08.142]  Well, we're living it one way or the other.
[00:09:08.522 --> 00:09:11.963]  It's either real, in prophecy, or they've used it as a blueprint.
[00:09:14.583 --> 00:09:16.124]  And that's really the deception of the elite.
[00:09:16.164 --> 00:09:21.625]  They believe they're using it as a blueprint, which is the biggest joke of all.
[00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:26.404]  Because even if you're using it as a blueprint, you then make it reality.
[00:09:26.924 --> 00:09:28.025]  Because that's what humans do.
[00:09:28.185 --> 00:09:28.986]  We build it.
[00:09:29.667 --> 00:09:30.167]  We make it.
[00:09:30.848 --> 00:09:31.889]  We're able to construct it.
[00:09:31.909 --> 00:09:33.410]  See if we can envision it.
[00:09:35.952 --> 00:09:44.099]  And that's why the globalists tell us that we're a bad species, and an ugly species, and a stupid species, and we need to be brushed off the earth.
[00:09:45.079 --> 00:09:47.361]  Talking to us like they're not human.
[00:09:48.102 --> 00:09:49.123]  Because they're psychopaths.
[00:09:51.206 --> 00:09:59.231]  And a lot of psychiatrists and experts that study real psychopaths will tell you they're not people and they don't see you as having any value.
[00:10:00.572 --> 00:10:10.759]  They don't have the real human components like passion and love and honor.
[00:10:14.862 --> 00:10:16.143]  All they want to do is control.
[00:10:23.029 --> 00:10:25.670]  Look at DrudgeReport.com today if you're watching us on television.
[00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.873]  If you're on the radio, obviously go to Infowars.com or DrudgeReport.com and you can see these articles.
[00:10:31.574 --> 00:10:38.037]  Matt Lauer, Clinton global member to moderate first presidential forum.
[00:10:38.077 --> 00:10:46.542]  That's right, he's a big part of their global initiative where people put money in there and then they launder it and take it right back out.
[00:10:47.442 --> 00:10:48.923]  She keeps 96% one year, 97 another year.
[00:10:53.479 --> 00:10:54.399]  of the money for herself.
[00:10:54.419 --> 00:10:55.560]  At least she's better than Bono.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.620]  Bono gives 1.2%.
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.461]  No, Hillary gives 3 or 4%.
[00:10:59.821 --> 00:11:00.922]  She's very gracious.
[00:11:08.844 --> 00:11:09.364]  Oh boy.
[00:11:09.664 --> 00:11:11.925]  And now he's going to moderate the debate.
[00:11:16.507 --> 00:11:18.247]  You know, they don't want to make Trump a martyr.
[00:11:19.368 --> 00:11:22.689]  But Trump had better, better
[00:11:24.332 --> 00:11:25.872]  Watch the food he's eating.
[00:11:26.412 --> 00:11:27.573]  And obviously Trump knows that.
[00:11:27.593 --> 00:11:29.313]  But it just hit me.
[00:11:31.973 --> 00:11:34.234]  They like to see a great man crawl.
[00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:40.795]  They want to bring down strong people and make them weak like they are.
[00:11:43.835 --> 00:11:47.236]  Poison's always the number one go-to, isn't it?
[00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:51.297]  But there are more high-tech forms of poison today.
[00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:52.897]  Electromagnetic.
[00:11:57.551 --> 00:11:58.031]  Just a thought.
[00:11:58.632 --> 00:11:59.232]  Continuing.
[00:11:59.793 --> 00:12:02.335]  Oh, Facebook satellite burns on the pad.
[00:12:07.618 --> 00:12:14.183]  But Facebook is a deep state organ, so I'm sure it'll get a few more of those up real quick.
[00:12:15.925 --> 00:12:22.670]  SpaceX rocket explodes at Cape Canaveral Space Center, blowing up Facebook's 150 million pound internet satellite.
[00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.131]  Let's stop right there.
[00:12:26.158 --> 00:12:27.639]  You know what's getting blown up right now?
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.241]  I'm gonna make this announcement.
[00:12:30.562 --> 00:12:37.387]  Unequivocally, I'm sure of it, it hit me like a speed bullet freight train going downhill this morning.
[00:12:37.687 --> 00:12:43.893]  Hit me so hard that I was stunned for an hour or two.
[00:12:46.455 --> 00:12:47.075]  Ran over me.
[00:12:49.517 --> 00:12:50.338]  Like a thunderbolt.
[00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:53.139]  The main assault's on.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.600]  Everything else has been a test.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.381]  Everything else has been a beta test.
[00:12:56.521 --> 00:13:06.805]  Everything you've seen with the globalists studying cultures, societies, economies, getting everything rigged from the stock market to interest rates to currency rates, admittedly all rigged now.
[00:13:08.506 --> 00:13:12.608]  They now have major newspapers, have computers writing news stories for them.
[00:13:12.648 --> 00:13:13.809]  I told people about that 10 years ago.
[00:13:14.209 --> 00:13:15.109]  The CIA developed it.
[00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:16.830]  Now it's ubiquitous.
[00:13:22.213 --> 00:13:23.493]  The ships are going to robot.
[00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:26.234]  The cars are going to robot.
[00:13:26.854 --> 00:13:28.035]  The trucks are going to robot.
[00:13:31.996 --> 00:13:34.056]  The technocracy is in place.
[00:13:35.957 --> 00:13:39.678]  The New World Order is now officially in 2016.
[00:13:41.298 --> 00:13:45.499]  That's what the Supreme Court Justice was telling Drudge, get ready, it's all going to start next year.
[00:13:45.859 --> 00:13:46.240]  And it is.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.521]  They're going from beta to 1.0.
[00:13:52.793 --> 00:13:53.873]  That means New World Order.
[00:13:54.354 --> 00:13:54.994]  This is it.
[00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:56.675]  We are in the New World Order.
[00:13:57.015 --> 00:14:00.857]  We have crossed the line as of right now.
[00:14:02.737 --> 00:14:07.760]  Mark the date.
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:08.020]  9-1.
[00:14:13.742 --> 00:14:14.403]  September 1st, 2016.
[00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:21.426]  They've turned on the technocracy, the world government.
[00:14:22.472 --> 00:14:30.754]  And I've got all the articles in front of me where the internet censorship is exploding, where Germany's getting ready to collapse.
[00:14:32.014 --> 00:14:35.275]  They are rolling their whole thing out.
[00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.316]  They are censoring.
[00:14:36.656 --> 00:14:40.817]  When a guy saves a baby and is a hero, they blur the Trump office shirt on the news.
[00:14:41.517 --> 00:14:49.899]  I mean, they have armies of sycophant humans who are busily selling out their fellow humans, thinking they're going to get a slot at the table.
[00:14:54.648 --> 00:15:02.494]  Even though they're setting up automated algorithm AI systems to replace them.
[00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:20.747]  It'd be like if you were a chef that was cooking for cannibals and your food stock was, you know, a pin of 30 or 40 people and some of them were your family in there.
[00:15:20.767 --> 00:15:22.328]  But that's okay.
[00:15:23.345 --> 00:15:27.486]  And every day you knock somebody else on the head and then you bring them in and you cut them up.
[00:15:27.506 --> 00:15:33.247]  And then you cook them and you serve them to your masters upstairs.
[00:15:34.847 --> 00:15:35.908]  You don't really get a look at.
[00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:40.269]  You just kind of send the plates on, you know, through a conveyor belt.
[00:15:40.549 --> 00:15:41.469]  Something in there eats them.
[00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:51.231]  And then finally one day, you know, you get a little teletype out telling you, oh, we want you to train this individual to
[00:15:53.834 --> 00:15:54.394]  Help us cook!
[00:15:55.915 --> 00:15:56.676]  To prepare the meat!
[00:15:57.336 --> 00:15:58.157]  To prepare the feast!
[00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:01.279]  And you say, well, I'm the chef, I don't need any help.
[00:16:01.339 --> 00:16:03.401]  Oh, just please, train this new chef.
[00:16:03.781 --> 00:16:07.263]  Because we've been looking at you, and we think you're fattened up now, and it's time to eat you, too.
[00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:16.170]  And you dumbasses are sitting there with a pen of your fellow humans that you're serving up, and you don't understand, your neck's on the conveyor belt.
[00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:20.673]  Because you've been taught how to be a synthetic sociopath or psychopath.
[00:16:21.803 --> 00:16:37.453]  That's what all this TV and murder and the simulations and the shoot-em-up games and all of it and the degradation, the movies and the TV is just to get everybody ready to accept the implosion of the human condition.
[00:16:41.195 --> 00:16:49.140]  I'm really blown away by the social engineers and I mean they've got a really, really nasty, nasty, nasty
[00:16:55.191 --> 00:17:00.216]  They are the type of people that grab your kid out of the backyard and torture him for a month in a dungeon.
[00:17:00.256 --> 00:17:01.438]  I mean, that's what we're dealing with here.
[00:17:02.118 --> 00:17:11.008]  And it's come out in Europe where the top politicians and leaders have, like, basements with toddlers they torture for months and rape and kill.
[00:17:11.068 --> 00:17:13.270]  I mean, you're like, what in the world?
[00:17:13.751 --> 00:17:14.592]  That's who runs things!
[00:17:16.293 --> 00:17:17.475]  And to them, it's pretty.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.001]  To see breast cancer up a couple thousand percentage points.
[00:17:21.701 --> 00:17:24.903]  It's fun to see autism up tens of thousands of percentage points.
[00:17:25.723 --> 00:17:34.007]  It's fun to see the once great and mighty human condition brought low and to see us stumbling around shuffling zombies.
[00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.071]  I just can't believe it.
[00:17:44.052 --> 00:17:44.852]  And where are the men?
[00:17:44.892 --> 00:17:46.173]  Where are the people standing up?
[00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:53.919]  And it's here.
[00:17:55.721 --> 00:17:56.101]  It's on.
[00:17:58.363 --> 00:18:08.490]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles a day from the establishment on how they're going to censor and how they are censoring and how glorious it is and maybe we should start arresting people we disagree with.
[00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.411]  Oh yeah, let's do it!
[00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:10.652]  Oh yeah!
[00:18:11.372 --> 00:18:11.953]  That sounds fun!
[00:18:12.033 --> 00:18:21.340]  And it's weird, like the zombie trendies and stuff
[00:18:22.403 --> 00:18:28.867]  Are in a haze, and they've got this operating system of tyranny now, and they're getting off on it, and you see them hopping around.
[00:18:30.428 --> 00:18:33.950]  Like, just feeling the evil, and they're like, oh, this feels good!
[00:18:34.851 --> 00:18:37.993]  Other people know what's going on, they decide to punch out.
[00:18:38.213 --> 00:18:39.574]  They decide to clock out.
[00:18:39.874 --> 00:18:41.535]  They decide to try to escape.
[00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:44.997]  Because they can't handle it.
[00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:47.579]  I get it.
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.961]  Problem is, there's nowhere to punch out to.
[00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:52.902]  When we come back, I'm going to get more into the news.
[00:18:52.922 --> 00:18:58.286]  I'm going to play the amazingly historic and presidential speech of Donald J. Trump in Mexico.
[00:18:58.306 --> 00:19:00.267]  A very honorable speech.
[00:19:01.428 --> 00:19:04.310]  Just tell them, the Mexicans, look, I can't come down here and do whatever I want.
[00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.150]  You have your sovereignty.
[00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.731]  We have ours.
[00:19:06.491 --> 00:19:08.132]  We're all being screwed over by the multinationals.
[00:19:08.152 --> 00:19:08.773]  Let's work together.
[00:19:11.616 --> 00:19:13.178]  Trump believes in humanity.
[00:19:13.798 --> 00:19:15.901]  Trump believes he can give you a sophisticated argument.
[00:19:16.481 --> 00:19:19.304]  Trump believes he can talk about the real players and what's really happening.
[00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.308]  Trump is betting on that.
[00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:28.294]  Because, see, the globalists feed disinfo and low-grade information out to dumb people down.
[00:19:31.757 --> 00:19:33.179]  The whole program is in the message.
[00:19:35.114 --> 00:19:37.815]  What's in the message isn't even that important.
[00:19:38.435 --> 00:19:43.677]  Only that it be twisted and screwed up and full of garbage so that we just become a bunch of mindless idiots.
[00:19:44.238 --> 00:19:49.740]  But instead, Donald Trump believes people can actually understand what's going on and what's happening.
[00:19:54.762 --> 00:19:55.342]  That's coming up.
[00:19:56.317 --> 00:19:57.897]  The censorship news is over the top.
[00:19:58.778 --> 00:20:01.218]  They're going to bring, I told you they were going to do this, but they've announced it.
[00:20:01.238 --> 00:20:02.339]  I mean, Zuckerberg's been studying it.
[00:20:02.359 --> 00:20:07.320]  They're announcing Google is Chinese-style net censorship here in the U.S.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:07.980]  It's been announced.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:08.860]  It's now official.
[00:20:11.541 --> 00:20:17.863]  Before the Clintons left their governorship in Arkansas, more than 100 people had been suspiciously murdered.
[00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:24.814]  Hundreds more died during their first terms and the scourge continues to this day.
[00:20:25.915 --> 00:20:35.601]  DNC staffer after DNC staffer that speaks out against election fraud or leaks information to WikiLeaks ends up gunned down.
[00:20:36.462 --> 00:20:40.845]  And the Clinton crime family and their backers is now in the spotlight.
[00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:46.434]  If I die, if they kill me, it was done for a worthy cause.
[00:20:47.315 --> 00:20:49.357]  Somebody's gotta stand up against these people.
[00:20:50.398 --> 00:21:01.887]  Long before George W. Bush had taken office, or Senator Obama was even thinking about being president, I was there, exposing the crimes of the Clintons.
[00:21:02.767 --> 00:21:09.993]  So it is fitting that I, Alex Jones, called the Dark Heart by Hillary Clinton, would be your chronicler.
[00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:16.344]  A chronicler who risked his very life exposing these evil ones.
[00:21:16.684 --> 00:21:18.184]  It's required by Bill Clinton in 1992.
[00:21:18.265 --> 00:21:21.085]  And it was instituted here in Texas in 1993.
[00:21:21.165 --> 00:21:22.066]  I know the code, sir.
[00:21:22.546 --> 00:21:26.867]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:21:27.688 --> 00:21:34.270]  Just a few days ago, Hillary Clinton, one of the most powerful criminal kingpins in history,
[00:21:35.276 --> 00:21:41.242]  Came out on national television and said that I had a horrible dark heart.
[00:21:41.682 --> 00:21:48.269]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:50.070]  I thought back to the history
[00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:55.455]  Of the Clinton's reign of criminal terror in the last 20 plus years on this planet.
[00:21:56.256 --> 00:22:06.705]  And I have to tell you, it's surreal to realize that Alex Jones, little old me, is one of the main opposition points against these monsters.
[00:22:08.073 --> 00:22:17.821]  Once they were in the White House, they expanded the bombing to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of attacks a year on the infrastructure of Iraq.
[00:22:18.301 --> 00:22:31.392]  They got the UN to pass the most draconian sanctions ever in modern history, where medicine and food and all forms of technology were basically blocked from coming into the country.
[00:22:32.392 --> 00:22:36.576]  Over a million and a half Iraqis starved to death and died.
[00:22:37.688 --> 00:22:52.254]  And Hillary Clinton's mentor, Madeleine Albright, bragged on 16 Minutes and other channels that 500,000 dead Iraqi children were a good price to pay of the sanctions.
[00:22:53.294 --> 00:22:55.695]  We have heard that half a million children have died.
[00:22:56.596 --> 00:23:00.897]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[00:23:01.998 --> 00:23:04.959]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[00:23:06.016 --> 00:23:10.697]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[00:23:11.197 --> 00:23:21.100]  But when you are a Machiavellian sociopath, or a sadistic psychopath, you don't look at things about alliances and who's right and who's wrong.
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.801]  You look at a billion plus Muslims.
[00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:26.121]  And you look at Syria.
[00:23:26.882 --> 00:23:32.103]  And you look at the invasion points where you can come into all of Europe and take over.
[00:23:33.331 --> 00:23:35.633]  But first, you've got to get the weapons to invade.
[00:23:36.514 --> 00:23:37.354]  And you see Libya.
[00:23:37.895 --> 00:23:39.796]  And Muammar Gaddafi was set up.
[00:23:40.257 --> 00:23:44.960]  Jihadists out of Saudi Arabia, via the State Department and Hillary, were brought into Benghazi.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.001]  They attacked the country.
[00:23:46.401 --> 00:23:49.584]  The West had a bombing campaign to back the takeover.
[00:23:49.984 --> 00:23:51.566]  Islamists were put in control.
[00:23:52.206 --> 00:23:52.767]  Christians
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.881]  Blacks, non-radical Muslims, Shiites and others were killed by the tens of thousands.
[00:23:59.502 --> 00:24:03.163]  And Hillary formed, by design, a failed state.
[00:24:03.543 --> 00:24:07.184]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:24:16.767 --> 00:24:18.007]  Johnny Cash bringing us in.
[00:24:24.055 --> 00:24:30.580]  Imagine being a soulless psychopath.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:36.905]  And then think what a soulless creature.
[00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:53.711]  ...wants to do.
[00:24:54.311 --> 00:24:57.573]  It wants to amass control... ...and power.
[00:24:58.053 --> 00:25:05.077]  And it wants to torture... ...and hold captive... ...innocence.
[00:25:06.277 --> 00:25:10.159]  Where are we?
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.022]  Heat our hospitals with dead babies.
[00:25:16.423 --> 00:25:21.027]  Where we test the flavoring for soft drinks with infant tissue.
[00:25:21.367 --> 00:25:28.473]  Where we splice our embryos with animals.
[00:25:30.235 --> 00:25:32.176]  And bring the abominations to term.
[00:25:33.177 --> 00:25:39.102]  Drown inside humans and animals.
[00:25:41.424 --> 00:25:42.505]  And a world government
[00:25:44.324 --> 00:25:50.949]  Where the cashless society control grid is only getting started.
[00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:59.234]  The crimes were like little waves on a pond compared to a tsunami.
[00:26:03.637 --> 00:26:08.641]  Hell itself will manifest on this planet if their program is allowed to be carried out.
[00:26:08.941 --> 00:26:11.122]  The Bible says if God didn't intervene,
[00:26:12.056 --> 00:26:15.338]  There would be no flesh left on the earth.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.021]  No flesh left.
[00:26:29.064 --> 00:26:32.246]  And now, the technology is there to do exactly that.
[00:26:33.578 --> 00:26:34.659]  I want to get to all this news.
[00:26:34.719 --> 00:26:35.499]  It's such a heavy news.
[00:26:35.519 --> 00:26:39.122]  There's so many incredibly important clubs, the most important ever.
[00:26:39.542 --> 00:26:45.847]  But I just want to let everybody know, the Globalists tend to launch major operations, give New World Order speeches on September 1st.
[00:26:45.867 --> 00:26:56.214]  I just walked into the office and talked to some of the guys and I said, a major jump in activity, the likes of which we've never seen, the coordination, the Globalists admitting they're launching a lot of new big initiatives.
[00:26:56.775 --> 00:26:58.036]  This is the global push.
[00:26:58.096 --> 00:27:02.279]  And it hit me that when we talk about them stealing the election,
[00:27:04.332 --> 00:27:09.973]  And we talk about the Justice Department and Homeland Security saying it's going to come in and run the election now.
[00:27:12.114 --> 00:27:16.355]  But Donald Trump's a kook for saying they would do that a month ago.
[00:27:16.375 --> 00:27:20.536]  They're like, where's the logic in that?
[00:27:20.556 --> 00:27:21.656]  It's a war on logic.
[00:27:26.398 --> 00:27:30.819]  These people are just totally turned over to lies and
[00:27:32.034 --> 00:27:50.287]  It's one unified spectrum of deception, whether it's CNN, or whether it's MSNBC, or NPR, and they just spew an entire false reality, and their minions go with it in lockstep, and no one reports on the new emails pouring out daily.
[00:27:50.867 --> 00:27:55.891]  There's new ones, they're on Infowars.com, where Nancy Pelosi admits that
[00:27:57.978 --> 00:27:59.839]  ISIS is Al Qaeda and it's U.S.
[00:27:59.879 --> 00:28:02.200]  policy to use them in the Middle East to take over countries.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.340]  Now, we already knew that.
[00:28:04.321 --> 00:28:05.582]  Cy Hirsch has come out with that.
[00:28:07.542 --> 00:28:08.943]  And I just use that as a credibility point.
[00:28:09.003 --> 00:28:09.503]  We broke it.
[00:28:11.544 --> 00:28:12.024]  You broke it.
[00:28:12.465 --> 00:28:12.965]  You pushed it.
[00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:14.786]  Rudge put it out.
[00:28:14.806 --> 00:28:15.126]  It's true.
[00:28:17.415 --> 00:28:24.981]  It's like going into a bar and, you know, some guy's playing darts and puts all five darts right in the bullseye, and you go, that guy's a terrible dart player.
[00:28:25.482 --> 00:28:27.443]  Yeah, that'd be a satire joke, wouldn't it?
[00:28:27.964 --> 00:28:31.407]  But the public would believe it, if they're in that zombified condition.
[00:28:31.747 --> 00:28:32.988]  Yes, you're a terrible dart player!
[00:28:40.474 --> 00:28:40.934]  Amazing.
[00:28:42.095 --> 00:28:42.276]  So,
[00:28:43.706 --> 00:28:48.950]  Looking at this, let me show you what's emblematic before I come back and get into all the censorship and then play Trump's speech.
[00:28:50.611 --> 00:28:51.292]  What's emblematic?
[00:28:52.533 --> 00:29:02.501]  Watch headline news who just fired Dr. Drew because he dared come out and say Hillary needs to be assessed.
[00:29:05.543 --> 00:29:10.127]  HLN blurs out Trump on man's t-shirt who saved baby from hot car.
[00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:16.230]  When they rebroadcast it.
[00:29:17.151 --> 00:29:18.691]  Isn't that just special?
[00:29:19.372 --> 00:29:21.432]  That's what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:24.914 --> 00:29:35.518]  And this story came out in October of 2015, and BBC and others pitched it like it was no big deal.
[00:29:36.363 --> 00:29:44.528]  Total control over the internet, creating electronic ghettos where you can't even make money on the internet or have a job in the physical third dimension.
[00:29:45.288 --> 00:29:51.231]  If you criticize the government and corporations, YouTube and Google are now announcing this system.
[00:29:52.612 --> 00:29:53.472]  In the terms of service.
[00:29:55.273 --> 00:29:56.174]  It's happening.
[00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.713]  Zuckerberg has been coordinating with the Chinese communists as well.
[00:30:00.054 --> 00:30:00.955]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.435 --> 00:30:03.037]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.978 --> 00:30:06.662]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.879 --> 00:30:16.824]  Italian authorities are so concerned with their youth joining the ranks of ISIS, they've decided to pay them not to.
[00:30:17.044 --> 00:30:23.089]  According to the Washington Post, half a million young Italians are about to receive free money to stay away from terrorism.
[00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:29.373]  Europe is in a free fall, struggling to counter the threat of ISIS and other groups that are aggressively recruiting in Western Europe.
[00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:35.418]  But Italy says they're keeping their kids away from terrorism by giving more than half a million 18-year-olds a voucher for $500.
[00:30:36.539 --> 00:30:42.042]  The voucher will allow the recipients to visit museums, go to concerts, even see movies at reduced prices.
[00:30:42.302 --> 00:30:44.583]  It sends a clear message, the program director said.
[00:30:44.683 --> 00:30:50.146]  He goes on to say, a welcome for those who reach the age of 18 and a reminder of how crucial culture is.
[00:30:50.346 --> 00:30:52.807]  They imagine terror, we answer with culture.
[00:30:53.007 --> 00:30:54.768]  They destroy statues, we love art.
[00:30:54.988 --> 00:31:02.592]  The cultural battle that he explains does not include curbing the mass influx of refugees into Italy from the Middle East and Northern Africa.
[00:31:02.912 --> 00:31:06.784]  Those refugees who carry those dangerous ideologies, he's trying to combat.
[00:31:07.045 --> 00:31:09.613]  I'm Margaret Hal reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:16.863]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:31:17.223 --> 00:31:20.125]  Dr. Group, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:31:20.465 --> 00:31:25.647]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:31:26.068 --> 00:31:32.051]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:31:32.191 --> 00:31:35.312]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:31:35.472 --> 00:31:36.913]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:31:37.133 --> 00:31:41.257]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:31:41.457 --> 00:31:44.320]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.981]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:31:46.061 --> 00:31:49.244]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:31:49.544 --> 00:31:51.847]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:31:52.147 --> 00:31:53.108]  It's in powder form.
[00:31:53.208 --> 00:31:55.910]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.671]  I take this.
[00:31:56.791 --> 00:31:58.493]  This is the product that I take.
[00:31:58.593 --> 00:32:00.574]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:32:01.395 --> 00:32:02.156]  We fight the Globals.
[00:32:02.176 --> 00:32:03.057]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:32:03.337 --> 00:32:09.944]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:10.725 --> 00:32:11.706]  Brain Force is here.
[00:32:12.226 --> 00:32:14.508]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:22.596]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:32:23.379 --> 00:32:26.942]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:32:26.962 --> 00:32:29.324]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:32:29.684 --> 00:32:33.187]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:32:33.247 --> 00:32:36.390]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:41.654]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:32:42.214 --> 00:32:44.056]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:32:44.396 --> 00:32:48.819]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.001]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:32:51.622 --> 00:32:53.083]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:32:53.223 --> 00:32:53.483]  Exactly.
[00:32:53.503 --> 00:32:57.287]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:32:57.787 --> 00:33:05.033]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:05.333 --> 00:33:05.774]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:22.034 --> 00:33:36.980]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the leading voice globally in the fight for human empowerment against the global technocratic tyranny.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.281]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:43.482 --> 00:33:44.803]  And those are war drums, folks.
[00:33:44.903 --> 00:33:47.524]  That's what this broadcast is all about, trying to get people out of their trance.
[00:33:49.133 --> 00:33:59.796]  Get them out of the virtual reality for just long enough to see what's being woven around you and how many people and civilizations and countries have been sucked dry by these spiders.
[00:34:07.538 --> 00:34:09.519]  The innocent are crying out for protection.
[00:34:09.579 --> 00:34:10.419]  You can feel it.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:15.180]  All right.
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.101]  Let me plunge into the news now.
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.855]  I'll get into the Trump speech and a lot more before I go any further.
[00:34:24.557 --> 00:34:26.398]  I'm not going to sit here and do a long pitch.
[00:34:27.218 --> 00:34:46.145]  I've just gotten to the point where I want to thank the listeners and viewers that understand that they're trying to censor everyone and shut everybody's advertising money off and bankrupt talk radio and take over Fox News and we have their own memos and Hillary Clinton coming out in her fundraising emails, this isn't even secret, saying we're going to shut down the alt media starting with Breitbart.
[00:34:46.265 --> 00:34:48.206]  This is outrageous.
[00:34:51.044 --> 00:34:54.966]  And instead, they've got pundits on TV going, yeah, that's great.
[00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:56.586]  They don't have a right to exist.
[00:34:58.447 --> 00:35:03.709]  The refrain now when we go out and cover anti-Trump rallies is, Alex Jones needs to die.
[00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.171]  Donald Trump needs to die.
[00:35:07.271 --> 00:35:09.992]  And it's always super weak, pathetic people.
[00:35:10.973 --> 00:35:13.314]  I just want to throw around talk of killing.
[00:35:13.554 --> 00:35:15.555]  It's, oh, it's so historic.
[00:35:16.615 --> 00:35:20.177]  It's got all the tell-tale signs of society about to go completely belly up.
[00:35:20.217 --> 00:35:24.078]  And again, Germany says brace for a giant emergency.
[00:35:24.919 --> 00:35:26.139]  The German government does.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.540]  We write a story about it and people go, oh, you're fear-mongering.
[00:35:29.681 --> 00:35:30.441]  I'm fear-mongering?
[00:35:31.061 --> 00:35:33.262]  German banks are teetering on the verge of collapse.
[00:35:33.302 --> 00:35:34.823]  That's mainstream German news.
[00:35:35.003 --> 00:35:36.583]  That'll make Lehman Brothers in 2007 and 2008
[00:35:38.874 --> 00:35:46.535]  Look like a breeze, a summer breeze compared to a typhoon, a hurricane, a tempest, a maelstrom.
[00:35:50.036 --> 00:35:51.256]  You can see it intellectually.
[00:35:51.296 --> 00:35:52.136]  You can feel it.
[00:35:52.436 --> 00:35:53.116]  I mean, I am.
[00:35:53.877 --> 00:35:59.658]  I told you building up the last few years, my concern, my spirit has been really concerned five times, whatever it was, 10 times, 20 times.
[00:35:59.758 --> 00:36:04.218]  It's now just full blast.
[00:36:04.338 --> 00:36:06.359]  Spider sense is, oh, my God.
[00:36:06.759 --> 00:36:08.259]  And then I can look at it happening.
[00:36:11.616 --> 00:36:21.299]  And you can look at the headlines and what they're doing and how they're pitching it, and then you can go, oh, let me go actually read what Devo said about this three years ago, and you go read it, and it's exactly what they're doing.
[00:36:21.319 --> 00:36:24.100]  But I don't even need to go read their documents anymore.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.121]  I've got their plan, because I've watched them lay it out.
[00:36:27.141 --> 00:36:32.403]  It's like they're laying out more railroad track in front of me, and I see where it's going, and I'm like, oh my God, this is unbelievable!
[00:36:33.964 --> 00:36:38.545]  You talk about a highway to hell, people think of that in ACDC songs as some fun place.
[00:36:38.865 --> 00:36:40.146]  No, this isn't fun where we're going.
[00:36:41.317 --> 00:36:44.859]  A lot of people say, Alex, don't fear monger, you know, don't scare us.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.680]  It's not fear mongering.
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:47.600]  Our house is on fire.
[00:36:48.061 --> 00:36:50.282]  Our only hope is to admit this is going on.
[00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:55.885]  When I say repent, I don't mean to go to some establishment government-run church and worship some preacher like he's God.
[00:36:56.425 --> 00:36:59.547]  I mean, really get on our knees and repent.
[00:37:02.889 --> 00:37:04.530]  Just for everything going on in the world.
[00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:06.711]  I'll tell you what really gets to me.
[00:37:08.474 --> 00:37:11.296]  I, in my spirit, my gut, I feel guilty for all this stuff.
[00:37:11.456 --> 00:37:14.097]  And I see the evil increasing and it's so horrible.
[00:37:14.878 --> 00:37:21.001]  And it also, it wants to hurt innocent people and I just feel like I'm on fire to resist it.
[00:37:21.021 --> 00:37:24.783]  I mean, I don't know how else to describe it.
[00:37:24.803 --> 00:37:26.604]  It's like, well, we need to fight this right now.
[00:37:26.624 --> 00:37:27.484]  We need to do something.
[00:37:29.666 --> 00:37:34.388]  And the impetus I had 25 years ago to fight, you know, it was there, but it was more like just a push.
[00:37:34.508 --> 00:37:36.029]  Now it's like a torrent.
[00:37:38.206 --> 00:37:53.415]  And I just simply want to ignite people's gut level instincts to see evil and to see tyranny and to see how if you're in a parking lot and some shady guys start getting around you, you go, oh my God, I'm about to get shaken down.
[00:37:53.435 --> 00:37:54.916]  Everybody's ever been shaken down.
[00:37:58.318 --> 00:37:59.519]  That's how most muggings happen.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.141]  People just brandish a gun or a knife or say, we're going to beat the hell out of you.
[00:38:02.161 --> 00:38:02.621]  Give us your money.
[00:38:02.641 --> 00:38:03.282]  You should do it to women.
[00:38:03.482 --> 00:38:06.884]  The point is, we're being surrounded and they're shaking us down.
[00:38:08.078 --> 00:38:11.101]  And we're going, oh, thank you, New World Order, you're so nice.
[00:38:11.741 --> 00:38:15.584]  Because the mainstream media continues to run this con game that what they're doing is okay.
[00:38:16.305 --> 00:38:17.025]  It's not okay.
[00:38:17.145 --> 00:38:18.166]  It's a false illusion.
[00:38:18.246 --> 00:38:26.293]  And people are seeing through that illusion, but they can't have any independent media out there that'll say back to the public, yes, you're right, what you see is wrong.
[00:38:27.174 --> 00:38:28.515]  6% trust rate in mainstream media.
[00:38:32.138 --> 00:38:35.921]  So, that's where all this is going.
[00:38:38.134 --> 00:38:39.035]  I'm not going to belabor it.
[00:38:39.495 --> 00:38:44.459]  We sell the very best products, the very best nutraceuticals out there at very, very low prices.
[00:38:44.539 --> 00:38:47.081]  We have the best selenium from our research.
[00:38:47.142 --> 00:38:48.523]  It's just amazing for the mustard seed.
[00:38:48.763 --> 00:38:50.905]  Such a key element.
[00:38:52.086 --> 00:38:55.589]  Just go research selenium for yourself and then realize why you want BioTrue.
[00:38:56.549 --> 00:38:57.991]  Selenium from Infowarsandlife.com.
[00:38:58.911 --> 00:39:02.094]  Everybody needs multivitamins and most of them are synthetic or you don't absorb them.
[00:39:02.775 --> 00:39:05.277]  We set out, it took us two and a half plus years to develop it.
[00:39:06.488 --> 00:39:07.249]  It's proprietary.
[00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:12.535]  Plant-derived vitamin-mineral fusion with the amino acids and other cofactors.
[00:39:13.556 --> 00:39:17.641]  Great way to get your kids, you know, to be healthier and to actually absorb their multivitamin.
[00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:19.343]  A true game-changer.
[00:39:20.705 --> 00:39:22.307]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:39:23.989 --> 00:39:24.729]  To spread the word,
[00:39:25.933 --> 00:39:29.195]  We have the Hillary for Prison shirts that are at cost.
[00:39:30.055 --> 00:39:29.195]  $9.95.
[00:39:30.235 --> 00:39:31.876]  That includes shipping.
[00:39:32.296 --> 00:39:36.439]  $9.95 is what it cost us to print them, ship them out the door to your door.
[00:39:36.939 --> 00:39:40.521]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:39:43.423 --> 00:39:46.504]  And then that funds the running of this media operation.
[00:39:49.106 --> 00:39:51.167]  What you can see is changing the world.
[00:39:52.318 --> 00:39:53.999]  Because you are changing the world.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:40:16.198]  But more importantly than even buying the products, I do ask for your prayers and I do ask that you make sure that all of our efforts are not in vain and that you send out the videos, the articles, the information we put out and that you save it and you make copies of it and you share it with people and we need a desperation
[00:40:17.623 --> 00:40:26.348]  And people always misinterpret the term desperation and just think of somebody who's totally given up on an island and is going to starve to death and then they have desperation.
[00:40:27.889 --> 00:40:37.334]  It's larger than that and I forget whoever one of the most famous samurais was, but I've quoted the quote many times that the way of the samurai is desperate.
[00:40:38.635 --> 00:40:41.937]  And that means in a fight, like everything you've got, you're desperate.
[00:40:42.497 --> 00:40:44.359]  You're desperate to get the car off your little kid.
[00:40:44.659 --> 00:40:46.460]  And people see some 60 year old woman, you know,
[00:40:47.287 --> 00:40:49.608]  Lift a car off a... Police have seen that many times.
[00:40:49.648 --> 00:40:50.329]  Firefighters, you name it.
[00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:51.489]  They're like, how the hell did you do that?
[00:40:52.049 --> 00:40:54.611]  That's because the governor's, which is off.
[00:40:54.891 --> 00:40:56.071]  We have to get desperate people.
[00:40:57.392 --> 00:41:05.476]  We're in desperate straits and the system laughs and giggles and makes fun of everything and tries to transmute us being concerned into that.
[00:41:07.357 --> 00:41:10.259]  But I'm personally so on fire with concern.
[00:41:10.559 --> 00:41:11.979]  It's like 69 degrees in here.
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:12.880]  I'm sweating.
[00:41:16.789 --> 00:41:25.761]  Because my body is on fire with the desperation of trying to get people out of their trance.
[00:41:26.321 --> 00:41:28.104]  Now I'm going to go to the Trump clip in a moment.
[00:41:28.124 --> 00:41:29.746]  I'm going to skip a network break coming up so we have time.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.621]  But it's here.
[00:41:32.681 --> 00:41:33.702]  The censorship's happening.
[00:41:33.782 --> 00:41:34.542]  It's intensifying.
[00:41:34.822 --> 00:41:36.364]  They say they're coming for us.
[00:41:36.684 --> 00:41:41.068]  They have attorney generals meeting wanting to arrest people that deny man-made climate change.
[00:41:41.628 --> 00:41:43.690]  They are persecuting people in the schools.
[00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.031]  They're annihilating free speech.
[00:41:45.331 --> 00:41:49.695]  They're blurring Trump shirts on TV when they invite someone on as a guest who's a hero.
[00:41:50.495 --> 00:41:52.237]  It is total management crafting.
[00:41:53.178 --> 00:41:55.019]  It is propaganda to the 10th level.
[00:41:55.319 --> 00:42:00.884]  Remember two years ago, Congress, quote, legalized the CIA involved in domestic propaganda?
[00:42:06.539 --> 00:42:17.983]  And then the Deputy Secretary of Defense came out and gave a speech to the Military and Civilian Psychological Warfare Group.
[00:42:19.383 --> 00:42:20.224]  45 minute long speech.
[00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:20.764]  I played it.
[00:42:23.425 --> 00:42:28.366]  And they talked about the drudge effect and they said we can't lie anymore because we'll get caught by the internet.
[00:42:28.706 --> 00:42:30.087]  Drudge being emblematic of that.
[00:42:31.607 --> 00:42:37.636]  And it cut to the people in the audience, and the older ones look completely sick, because they knew what this really was.
[00:42:37.656 --> 00:42:43.944]  This was the announcement of... We're going operational here, domestically.
[00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:45.836]  And you're going to go out and do it.
[00:42:46.176 --> 00:42:52.540]  But then they had some younger people that were in PR and writing for armed services publications.
[00:42:52.881 --> 00:42:55.763]  Get up and go, this is great because I really don't like having to lie to people.
[00:42:55.803 --> 00:42:58.685]  And they're like, oh, thank you.
[00:42:58.705 --> 00:42:59.845]  She doesn't quite get it, does she?
[00:43:00.506 --> 00:43:01.827]  She's like, oh, we're going to tell the truth now.
[00:43:11.357 --> 00:43:17.349]  It goes further than that, because at that very time, large sections of the military were actually refusing to go along with it.
[00:43:18.331 --> 00:43:23.301]  So see, what they even claimed they were doing, even though it was a PSYOP, backfired, because at this point,
[00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:38.999]  With a general population that is in a trance, won't stand up for anybody including themselves, who's the only group they know that as twisted and screwed up in many cases as they are, like all of us, the military.
[00:43:39.699 --> 00:43:43.042]  They're phasing the military out right now, they're bringing in automation, they're bringing in machines.
[00:43:45.904 --> 00:43:52.448]  They've got all the movies and video games priming the little girls to not be princesses or doctors or, no, no, you're gonna be a soldier now.
[00:43:54.377 --> 00:43:55.337]  They're gonna be a technocrat.
[00:43:56.398 --> 00:44:17.886]  And I was just thinking about how they're installing dictators in Italy and in other countries like Greece, where they actually put Goldman Sachs presidents and Goldman Sachs directors in, and they say, oh, we call this technocracy when we install someone.
[00:44:19.387 --> 00:44:22.948]  I remember that major bank head
[00:44:31.496 --> 00:44:42.722]  When I was on the airplane, off record, where I'd tell you his name, just looking at me and going, Alex, the big banks know how to run things better, and soon we're going to run everything.
[00:44:43.742 --> 00:44:46.504]  And you think the public's going to adapt and wake up and fight this?
[00:44:46.544 --> 00:44:48.525]  No, they're going to adapt to submitting to it.
[00:44:50.566 --> 00:44:53.747]  Because basically, humanity's done.
[00:44:55.148 --> 00:44:56.589]  And he had the perfect hair,
[00:44:57.694 --> 00:45:02.636]  Perfect smug face in the perfect suit that didn't even look wrinkled after a three and a half hour flight from Austin to New York.
[00:45:03.497 --> 00:45:07.178]  And he got his black trench coat and put it over his arm and just laughed at me.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:21.765]  But in my hours of conversation with him, sitting in first class right beside me, when he talked about his dad, a general, who he was visiting in San Antonio,
[00:45:25.759 --> 00:45:28.401]  You know, he looked like he loved his dad and had this look in his eye.
[00:45:28.681 --> 00:45:29.761]  Yeah, my dad's getting old.
[00:45:30.462 --> 00:45:31.742]  This guy would look like he was about 60.
[00:45:35.184 --> 00:45:40.527]  And it's like you care about your dad, but you don't care about the general public because you think they're stupid.
[00:45:40.828 --> 00:45:46.331]  But the ruling engineers admit they designed it to make people even stupider than they already would be.
[00:45:47.371 --> 00:45:52.214]  So you care about your daddy, but you don't care about people around you who aren't your family.
[00:45:52.234 --> 00:45:53.395]  So you're not a psychopath.
[00:45:54.701 --> 00:45:57.703]  You're an arrogant person that just wants power.
[00:46:00.925 --> 00:46:01.746]  You're a control freak.
[00:46:05.368 --> 00:46:07.870]  And you better hope there's not a hell, buddy boy.
[00:46:09.151 --> 00:46:10.292]  And I'll assure you there is.
[00:46:12.293 --> 00:46:14.415]  One dimension over, sweetie pie.
[00:46:16.516 --> 00:46:17.317]  One jump.
[00:46:18.998 --> 00:46:21.520]  And you're not gonna be here anymore.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:37.570]  When you go through that portal that atheists and everybody else go through, and every person from every culture throughout time says they see when you die, you're going to have to go be with people like you.
[00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:38.230]  That's all.
[00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:40.892]  You just go like a magnet to who you are.
[00:46:42.153 --> 00:46:44.435]  You want to be like this at the next level?
[00:46:45.845 --> 00:46:48.928]  When we graduate from this level, that's how the universe works.
[00:46:49.208 --> 00:46:53.112]  When we go to the next level, you don't want to go to the next level, do you?
[00:46:53.432 --> 00:46:56.735]  You want to go down a level, don't you?
[00:46:57.816 --> 00:46:58.436]  They call that hell.
[00:47:00.098 --> 00:47:03.441]  Now, it's hell because there's people like you in it.
[00:47:03.781 --> 00:47:04.402]  You make it hell.
[00:47:06.444 --> 00:47:11.969]  You, and your hate, and your greed, and your weakness, and your dishonor.
[00:47:12.987 --> 00:47:14.287]  Consume yourselves.
[00:47:14.667 --> 00:47:15.708]  Your own kindling.
[00:47:15.948 --> 00:47:16.608]  It's metaphysical.
[00:47:17.468 --> 00:47:18.188]  It's archetypal.
[00:47:19.628 --> 00:47:20.208]  It's poetry.
[00:47:20.769 --> 00:47:21.209]  In motion.
[00:47:21.629 --> 00:47:26.990]  I want to play the incredible Trump speech here, and then we've got a bunch of big guests they haven't even gotten to that are being censored, you name it.
[00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:30.030]  I've got the Chinese-style social credit.
[00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:31.051]  Oh, it's a social credit!
[00:47:31.351 --> 00:47:37.652]  If you criticize government or corporations, we just don't let you operate on the internet anymore, and you get a low score, and then you physically can't have a job either.
[00:47:38.564 --> 00:47:39.164]  Mark of the Beast.
[00:47:39.984 --> 00:47:40.304]  What it is?
[00:47:40.345 --> 00:47:40.785]  Mark of the Beast.
[00:47:40.805 --> 00:47:43.425]  If you're not a good little globalist, you won't be able to use the internet.
[00:47:43.645 --> 00:47:45.826]  And that's what YouTube has announced at their beginning.
[00:47:47.026 --> 00:48:03.531]  Oh, if we decide, if the social community diversity team, is what it's called, people complain and then we decide in a little proletariat meeting, in a little commissar meeting, then you, you don't get to make money on your channel anymore.
[00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:06.972]  We're going to make money on it and break our deal with you.
[00:48:08.148 --> 00:48:09.008]  They were always planning this.
[00:48:09.428 --> 00:48:10.008]  Carrot of the stick.
[00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:18.470]  Now, Donald Trump, the statesman, the pure presidential material, the man, not a faker.
[00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:27.512]  It's like David fighting Goliath.
[00:48:28.152 --> 00:48:29.673]  He, I guess, would be King David.
[00:48:30.653 --> 00:48:32.093]  But we don't want to be blessed, do we?
[00:48:33.613 --> 00:48:35.434]  No, we want Judge Isabel.
[00:48:35.454 --> 00:48:36.174]  That's what we want.
[00:48:38.482 --> 00:48:43.505]  And boy, if she doesn't fit the bill of Jezebel, perfectly tailored, nobody does.
[00:48:47.888 --> 00:48:54.572]  He goes to Mexico, and I said yesterday, and Trump didn't get this from me, Trump understands the battle better than I do.
[00:48:56.593 --> 00:48:58.554]  And I said, we don't know what he's going to say in Mexico.
[00:48:58.755 --> 00:48:59.435]  There's big news out of him.
[00:48:59.455 --> 00:49:00.175]  No one knows what he's going to say.
[00:49:00.195 --> 00:49:05.079]  And I said yesterday, over and over again, I said, he goes down there, he needs to say, let's fight the new world order and globalism together.
[00:49:05.339 --> 00:49:06.119]  Let's come together.
[00:49:06.139 --> 00:49:07.060]  Let's defeat this.
[00:49:08.902 --> 00:49:11.303]  Let's not be controlled by multinationals.
[00:49:11.323 --> 00:49:17.107]  Let's have America and Mexico neighbors team up to build each other up.
[00:49:17.147 --> 00:49:18.087]  It's something he's saying to Russia.
[00:49:21.149 --> 00:49:23.410]  And they took this olive branch and the media spun it.
[00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:24.030]  It was a horrible thing.
[00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:25.531]  And he did say, I'm sovereign.
[00:49:25.771 --> 00:49:26.372]  You're sovereign.
[00:49:26.672 --> 00:49:27.372]  America's sovereign.
[00:49:27.732 --> 00:49:28.573]  We can't do this.
[00:49:29.173 --> 00:49:31.134]  People just can't come over to Mexico and do whatever they want.
[00:49:31.154 --> 00:49:33.496]  That's the same thing here.
[00:49:33.536 --> 00:49:34.596]  You know that's common sense.
[00:49:36.097 --> 00:49:37.238]  He talked to the public.
[00:49:38.086 --> 00:49:44.010]  He talked to the Americans, the people of the world, but directly to the Mexicans, and said, I don't think you're stupid.
[00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:46.172]  I'm not going to dumb this argument down.
[00:49:48.233 --> 00:49:54.717]  Here is Donald Trump's address in Mexico yesterday before he got on the plane and went and gave a bunch of other speeches.
[00:49:56.719 --> 00:50:03.904]  Here's the- Let us now hear the words of the Republican candidate to the presidency of the United States of America, Mr. Donald Trump.
[00:50:04.984 --> 00:50:05.385]  Thank you.
[00:50:06.365 --> 00:50:07.186]  It is a great honor
[00:50:08.075 --> 00:50:11.658]  To be invited by you, Mr. President, a great, great honor.
[00:50:11.698 --> 00:50:12.098]  Thank you.
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:23.828]  We had a very substantive, direct, and constructive exchange of ideas over quite a period of time.
[00:50:25.009 --> 00:50:35.758]  I was straightforward in presenting my views about the impacts of current trade and immigration policies on the United States.
[00:50:36.767 --> 00:50:46.055]  As you know, I love the United States very much, and we want to make sure that the people of the United States are very well protected.
[00:50:46.816 --> 00:50:52.400]  You equally expressed your feelings and your love for Mexico.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:51:01.088]  The United States and Mexico share a 2,000-mile border, a half a trillion dollars in annual trade.
[00:51:02.023 --> 00:51:06.745]  And 1 million legal border crossings each and every day.
[00:51:07.925 --> 00:51:20.109]  We are united by our support for democracy, a great love for our people, and the contributions of millions of Mexican Americans to the United States.
[00:51:21.676 --> 00:51:33.428]  And I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican Americans, not only in terms of friendships, but in terms of the tremendous numbers that I employ in the United States.
[00:51:33.488 --> 00:51:36.011]  And they are amazing people, amazing people.
[00:51:37.634 --> 00:51:42.235]  I have many friends, so many friends, and so many friends coming to Mexico and in Mexico.
[00:51:42.295 --> 00:51:45.996]  I'm proud to say how many people I employ.
[00:51:47.077 --> 00:51:55.939]  And the United States first, second, and third generation Mexicans are just beyond reproach.
[00:51:56.899 --> 00:51:59.740]  Spectacular, spectacular, hardworking people.
[00:52:00.738 --> 00:52:07.581]  I have such great respect for them and their strong values of family, faith, and community.
[00:52:09.322 --> 00:52:17.225]  We all share a common interest in keeping our hemisphere safe, prosperous, and free.
[00:52:18.565 --> 00:52:27.089]  No one wins in either country when human smugglers and drug traffickers prey on innocent people
[00:52:28.447 --> 00:52:37.689]  When cartels commit acts of violence, when illegal weapons and cash flow from the United States into Mexico.
[00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:51.193]  Or when migrants from Central America make the dangerous trek, and it is very, very dangerous, into Mexico or the United States without legal authorization.
[00:52:52.637 --> 00:53:06.280]  I shared my strong view that NAFTA has been a far greater benefit to Mexico than it has been to the United States, and that it must be improved upon to make sure that workers
[00:53:07.265 --> 00:53:13.868]  And so important in both countries benefit from fair and reciprocal trade.
[00:53:14.989 --> 00:53:28.255]  I express that to the United States and that of the United States, that we must take action to stem this tremendous outflow of jobs from our country.
[00:53:29.616 --> 00:53:31.056]  It's happening every day.
[00:53:31.076 --> 00:53:36.259]  It's getting worse and worse and worse and we have to stop it.
[00:53:37.429 --> 00:53:46.679]  Prosperity and happiness in both of our countries will increase if we work together on the following five shared goals.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:51.805]  Number one, ending illegal immigration.
[00:53:52.794 --> 00:54:09.191]  Not just between our two countries, but including the illegal immigration and migration from Central and South Americans and from other regions that impact security and finances in both Mexico and the United States.
[00:54:10.432 --> 00:54:13.275]  This is a humanitarian disaster.
[00:54:14.648 --> 00:54:22.116]  The dangerous treks, the abuse by gangs and cartels, and the extreme physical dangers.
[00:54:23.257 --> 00:54:24.719]  And it must be solved.
[00:54:25.539 --> 00:54:27.401]  It must be solved quickly.
[00:54:28.162 --> 00:54:31.446]  Not fair to the people anywhere.
[00:54:32.156 --> 00:54:38.999]  Worldwide, you can truly say, but certainly not fair to the people of Mexico or the people of the United States.
[00:54:39.199 --> 00:54:45.302]  Number two, having a secure border is a sovereign right and mutually beneficial.
[00:54:46.103 --> 00:54:59.329]  We recognize and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, drugs,
[00:55:00.279 --> 00:55:00.880]  And weapons.
[00:55:01.821 --> 00:55:14.777]  Cooperation toward achieving this shared objective, and it will be shared, of safety for all citizens is paramount to both the United States and to Mexico.
[00:55:16.331 --> 00:55:18.713]  Number three, dismantling drug cartels.
[00:55:19.193 --> 00:55:22.155]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got to hit pause here because of developments.
[00:55:22.276 --> 00:55:29.541]  I knew that Matt Lauer was doing the so-called debate, and I predicted on air that they were going to somehow try to cancel the debates.
[00:55:29.641 --> 00:55:33.344]  And if this is accurate, and Daily Caller is very accurate, I'm going over their sources here.
[00:55:33.364 --> 00:55:36.747]  In fact, it's been announced by the debate commission.
[00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:39.068]  They've canceled the debate, is what this is.
[00:55:40.269 --> 00:55:42.371]  But in an exercise in brainwashing,
[00:55:43.809 --> 00:55:46.750]  Even alternative media doesn't get what the headlines should be.
[00:55:47.771 --> 00:55:57.075]  They're going to be on different stages, back-to-back, to control it, in case Trump says something they don't want said.
[00:55:57.115 --> 00:55:59.035]  This is unbelievable.
[00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:00.516]  I mean, we knew he'd destroy her.
[00:56:00.716 --> 00:56:01.616]  This is how rigged it is.
[00:56:01.917 --> 00:56:03.517]  They've already installed leaders in Europe.
[00:56:05.578 --> 00:56:07.279]  The globalists have already stolen all these elections.
[00:56:08.985 --> 00:56:11.006]  They've got Homeland Security taking over the election.
[00:56:11.766 --> 00:56:13.507]  They're saying they want to censor the press, and now!
[00:56:13.527 --> 00:56:15.448]  It's on DrugsReport.com.
[00:56:15.468 --> 00:56:16.729]  We're putting it on Infowars.com.
[00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:21.992]  Matt Lauer will moderate first forum between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[00:56:23.152 --> 00:56:23.472]  Wow.
[00:56:25.594 --> 00:56:26.794]  But then it's not that.
[00:56:28.155 --> 00:56:33.298]  This is being reported by NBC News, along with the Iraq and Afghanistan... This is insane.
[00:56:33.318 --> 00:56:33.838]  It will be a...
[00:56:35.257 --> 00:56:39.860]  One hour forum where Clinton and Trump will answer questions about national security.
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:40.580]  Now it's an hour.
[00:56:41.101 --> 00:56:41.821]  Should be two hours.
[00:56:41.921 --> 00:56:42.842]  Oh my gosh.
[00:56:43.482 --> 00:56:51.567]  It will be a one hour forum where Clinton and Trump will answer questions about national security, military affairs, and veterans issues in front of an audience mainly made up of members of the military.
[00:56:52.087 --> 00:56:56.210]  The two candidates will not be on stage at the same time, but will instead go back to back.
[00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:58.551]  They're going to have him look like the military attacks Trump.
[00:56:58.671 --> 00:56:59.812]  Oh my God, this is a psyop.
[00:57:00.312 --> 00:57:01.233]  He's walking into a trap.
[00:57:01.593 --> 00:57:04.915]  And they're doing this so he'll quote cancel, saying it's not a real debate.
[00:57:05.035 --> 00:57:05.796]  Because it's not a debate.
[00:57:06.976 --> 00:57:08.077]  And then they'll say he's a sore loser.
[00:57:08.698 --> 00:57:12.520]  I mean, they're asking him to get in a boxing match when the other guy's got a machine gun.
[00:57:16.222 --> 00:57:20.565]  It will be a one hour forum where Clinton and Trump will answer questions about national security.
[00:57:22.082 --> 00:57:27.084]  The two candidates will not be on the stage at the same time, but will instead go back-to-back.
[00:57:28.965 --> 00:57:36.189]  And of course, the media is making it all about how he's on the Clinton Foundation Global Initiative payroll.
[00:57:36.709 --> 00:57:37.369]  He works with them.
[00:57:37.889 --> 00:57:38.970]  But that's not even the issue.
[00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:46.413]  That's a big issue, but back-to-back, they're not even going... Oh, she's definitely got something wrong with her.
[00:57:46.713 --> 00:57:47.854]  She cannot even be out there for an hour.
[00:57:49.707 --> 00:57:52.349]  Instead we'll go back to back.
[00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:59.793]  That means one goes on for 30 minutes, that's all she can handle, and then Trump comes in.
[00:58:00.814 --> 00:58:04.296]  Print me every article, every debate commission statement on this.
[00:58:04.316 --> 00:58:05.717]  This is the number one story right now.
[00:58:06.237 --> 00:58:07.818]  I am physically, cannot handle it.
[00:58:09.659 --> 00:58:15.242]  And by that I mean physically it feels like it's even wrong to be here on air calmly talking about this.
[00:58:15.963 --> 00:58:17.584]  I mean this is outrageous.
[00:58:17.624 --> 00:58:19.285]  We should be in the streets.
[00:58:23.686 --> 00:58:25.307]  And their strength is our weakness.
[00:58:26.248 --> 00:58:34.794]  I look at how their supporters are these lazy, stupid zombies, and politically correct morons, and dumbed-down buffoons, and empty-headed
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.601]  Victims of this system.
[00:58:38.901 --> 00:58:40.582]  I just wish I could reach these people.
[00:58:40.602 --> 00:58:42.582]  I mean, I'm not calling them stupid to feel powerful.
[00:58:43.003 --> 00:58:48.605]  The globalists have made them dumb so they can be ruled over, but still they're like dangerous piranha.
[00:58:49.145 --> 00:58:50.426]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:58:50.466 --> 00:58:50.966]  Second hour.
[00:58:51.006 --> 00:58:52.106]  There's so much coming up.
[00:58:52.426 --> 00:58:53.727]  They're launching the takeover, folks.
[00:58:53.747 --> 00:58:54.467]  This is more proof.
[00:58:55.288 --> 00:58:58.329]  This is Soviet Union-level crap, okay?
[00:59:01.175 --> 00:59:08.744]  Once again, Donald Trump has stepped into the vacuum left by Hillary and Obama as he quickly accepted an offer from the Mexican President to meet.
[00:59:09.005 --> 00:59:18.236]  He not only met with the Mexican President, but he took control of the press conference afterwards, infuriating Trump's media opponents like Spanish-language channel anchor Jorge Ramos.
[00:59:18.536 --> 00:59:31.602]  Ramos inadvertently praised the leadership of Trump when he unleashed a string of tirades on Twitter in both English and Spanish, excoriating the Mexican president for looking passive, even for agreeing with Trump that NAFTA could be improved.
[00:59:31.882 --> 00:59:42.246]  Meanwhile, Hillary hasn't held a press conference for 272 days, since the beginning of December, before any primaries, and we're now over 80% of the way through the election.
[00:59:42.406 --> 00:59:49.089]  Hillary could only carp from the sidelines, as she did when Trump visited flood victims of Louisiana, while she ignored them completely.
[00:59:49.329 --> 00:59:55.872]  Don't expect Hillary to talk to the Mexican president before the election, because it would be followed by a press conference, and she can't handle that.
[00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:58.093]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:00:02.636 --> 01:00:05.277]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.388 --> 01:00:30.871]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.772 --> 01:00:41.773]  Of safety for all citizens is paramount to both the United States and to Mexico.
[01:00:43.342 --> 01:00:52.925]  Number three, dismantling drug cartels and ending the movement of illegal drugs, weapons, and funds across our border.
[01:00:54.685 --> 01:01:05.808]  This can only be done with cooperation, intelligence, and intelligence sharing, and joint operations between our two countries.
[01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:08.389]  It's the only way it's going to happen.
[01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:11.870]  Improving NAFTA, number four.
[01:01:13.464 --> 01:01:20.486]  NAFTA is a 22-year-old agreement that must be updated to reflect the realities of today.
[01:01:21.606 --> 01:01:32.548]  There are many improvements that could be made that would make both Mexico and the United States stronger and keep industry in our hemisphere.
[01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:37.929]  We have tremendous competition from China and from all over the world.
[01:01:38.509 --> 01:01:40.870]  Keep it in our hemisphere.
[01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:46.993]  Workers in both of our countries need a pay raise very desperately.
[01:01:47.253 --> 01:01:51.836]  In the United States, it's been 18 years, 18 years.
[01:01:52.836 --> 01:01:54.037]  Wages are going down.
[01:01:55.278 --> 01:02:03.723]  Improving pay standards and working conditions will create better results for all, and all workers in particular.
[01:02:04.283 --> 01:02:05.564]  There's a lot of value
[01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:12.567]  That can be created for both countries by working beautifully together.
[01:02:13.187 --> 01:02:15.088]  And that I am sure will happen.
[01:02:15.868 --> 01:02:21.772]  Number five, keep manufacturing wealth in our hemisphere.
[01:02:22.752 --> 01:02:35.880]  When jobs leave Mexico, the US or Central America and go overseas, it increases poverty and pressure on social services as well as pressures on cross
[01:02:36.792 --> 01:02:40.757]  Border migration, tremendous pressure.
[01:02:42.278 --> 01:02:46.303]  The bond between our two countries is deep and sincere.
[01:02:47.044 --> 01:02:53.591]  And both our nations benefit from a close and honest relationship between our two governments.
[01:02:54.526 --> 01:03:08.730]  A strong, prosperous, and vibrant Mexico is in the best interests of the United States, and will keep and help keep for a long, long period of time, America together.
[01:03:10.211 --> 01:03:18.733]  Both of our countries will work together for mutual good, and most importantly, for the mutual good of our people.
[01:03:20.054 --> 01:03:21.614]  Mr. President, I want to thank you.
[01:03:21.634 --> 01:03:23.515]  It's been a tremendous honor.
[01:03:24.611 --> 01:03:25.731]  And I called you a friend.
[01:03:26.072 --> 01:03:26.452]  Thank you.
[01:03:30.713 --> 01:03:32.514]  That was a very, very serious olive branch.
[01:03:32.614 --> 01:03:33.594]  It was common sense.
[01:03:33.834 --> 01:03:35.815]  It's what Trump really represents.
[01:03:36.535 --> 01:03:52.601]  But when America's been walked all over, and there are more Chinese a week coming in than there are Mexicans, and they admit they come here and CNN reports on why it's a good thing to have babies free and to get citizenship.
[01:03:56.587 --> 01:04:01.829]  And the articles when you read them say, strangely, it's mainly wealthy Chinese.
[01:04:02.649 --> 01:04:03.429]  Well, yeah.
[01:04:03.909 --> 01:04:05.170]  We've got better hospitals.
[01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:12.031]  And you just come on a couple-month vacation, and you have your baby, and it's all paid for.
[01:04:12.652 --> 01:04:13.732]  And then the baby's a citizen.
[01:04:14.252 --> 01:04:16.453]  Nobody else lets you do that.
[01:04:18.093 --> 01:04:23.975]  But Germany and places like that, because they're absolutely trying to bankrupt and create division.
[01:04:26.926 --> 01:04:27.546]  That's wrong.
[01:04:27.706 --> 01:04:29.407]  I can't go to China and get stuff free.
[01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:31.208]  It's not racist.
[01:04:32.408 --> 01:04:34.949]  And I'm not even going to play race card on that issue.
[01:04:34.969 --> 01:04:35.410]  I mean, I could.
[01:04:38.491 --> 01:04:39.311]  I'll hypothetically play it.
[01:04:39.551 --> 01:04:40.892]  And I'm not racist against Asians.
[01:04:40.932 --> 01:04:42.693]  My sister's Korean.
[01:04:42.913 --> 01:04:43.313]  Adopted.
[01:04:43.653 --> 01:04:44.393]  I love Asians.
[01:04:44.793 --> 01:04:45.674]  Of course I do.
[01:04:46.014 --> 01:04:47.475]  Point is, I don't have to start a preface with that.
[01:04:48.075 --> 01:04:52.897]  I show up in China and say I'm having my baby free, they would arrest me.
[01:04:56.246 --> 01:04:59.668]  If you smart off the Chinese police, they cut your testicles off in the street.
[01:05:01.809 --> 01:05:02.490]  Seriously, look it up.
[01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:05.071]  They just walk you over, cut your testicles off.
[01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:07.993]  That's what they do.
[01:05:08.533 --> 01:05:13.436]  Look it up.
[01:05:13.636 --> 01:05:17.918]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.221]  Americanism, not globalism!
[01:05:22.261 --> 01:05:22.801]  Americanism, not globalism!
[01:05:25.979 --> 01:05:30.021]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[01:05:30.341 --> 01:05:36.444]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[01:05:36.805 --> 01:05:44.328]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure, wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
[01:05:44.669 --> 01:05:53.073]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.
[01:05:53.493 --> 01:05:56.054]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[01:05:56.554 --> 01:06:07.457]  The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit.
[01:06:07.737 --> 01:06:13.399]  It's all training us to accept less, lowering expectations, a post-industrial world, a new dark age.
[01:06:13.519 --> 01:06:17.360]  That's what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.021]  When we abandon the policy of America first,
[01:06:21.861 --> 01:06:25.864]  We started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.
[01:06:26.264 --> 01:06:30.387]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger.
[01:06:30.647 --> 01:06:34.529]  A world that gets uglier and stupider and more stunted.
[01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:40.313]  The government should allow Hillary Clinton to become President of the United States.
[01:06:40.793 --> 01:06:42.515]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[01:06:42.835 --> 01:06:43.875]  Well, I voted for Hillary.
[01:06:43.895 --> 01:06:46.137]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[01:06:46.437 --> 01:06:48.358]  You want an image of the future, Winston?
[01:06:48.559 --> 01:06:50.740]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:57.265]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[01:06:57.465 --> 01:07:01.928]  Women are treated, discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:05.751]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[01:07:05.831 --> 01:07:06.691]  They're mistreated.
[01:07:07.372 --> 01:07:08.693]  She claims to be their champion.
[01:07:09.133 --> 01:07:17.738]  Don't look at me, Weston, and see the black circles around my eyes, and see how ugly and weak I am, expressing myself and dying, and I torture people 18 hours a day, and I have a horrible life!
[01:07:17.958 --> 01:07:22.300]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power, ripping apart humanity!
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:23.581]  We're here to hurt humans!
[01:07:23.681 --> 01:07:25.182]  We're here to suck your guts out!
[01:07:41.187 --> 01:07:43.068]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[01:07:43.128 --> 01:07:45.010]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:47.812]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:07:48.012 --> 01:07:48.812]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:48.913 --> 01:07:51.655]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:54.937]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:07:54.957 --> 01:07:56.258]  Deeply I think racist.
[01:07:56.278 --> 01:07:58.239]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[01:07:58.339 --> 01:08:00.141]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[01:08:00.161 --> 01:08:04.243]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:08:04.263 --> 01:08:05.424]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:05.484 --> 01:08:10.388]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:08:22.216 --> 01:08:27.357]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:08:27.877 --> 01:08:33.278]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:08:34.138 --> 01:08:40.880]  Alright, DrudgeReport.com has a Daily Caller article linked up.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.820]  The first debate isn't a debate at all.
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:50.402]  It's an event where Hillary goes back to back with Trump, two different stages, and they take basically pre-screened questions.
[01:08:50.422 --> 01:08:51.842]  You can bet your bottom dollar on that.
[01:08:53.459 --> 01:08:56.404]  Now they said they're gonna have other debates that'll be actual debates.
[01:08:56.444 --> 01:09:02.014]  We'll see if that happens because she never goes out on stage more than 15-20 minutes and she never speaks more than about 8 minutes.
[01:09:03.396 --> 01:09:06.118]  Now, I've got somebody who I'm a huge fan of.
[01:09:06.138 --> 01:09:07.279]  I know most of you are probably fans.
[01:09:07.299 --> 01:09:09.721]  I know Buckley here in the office is a huge fan.
[01:09:10.822 --> 01:09:13.404]  Years ago, it hanged Dilbert cartoons on his wall.
[01:09:13.424 --> 01:09:14.765]  In fact, it had a whole wall of them.
[01:09:15.466 --> 01:09:19.949]  Dilbert creator endorses Hillary out of fear for personal safety.
[01:09:19.969 --> 01:09:23.232]  Remember that article that Don Salazar wrote back on June 6th?
[01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:25.534]  So many death threats, so many attacks.
[01:09:25.654 --> 01:09:27.015]  Okay, okay, I will support her.
[01:09:27.795 --> 01:09:28.116]  You bet.
[01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.890]  Please back off.
[01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:31.751]  And of course, that's tongue-in-cheek in my view.
[01:09:31.771 --> 01:09:34.754]  We're going to talk to the man himself here in just a moment.
[01:09:35.675 --> 01:09:41.981]  But imagine even his light-hearted cartoons got massive threats.
[01:09:42.842 --> 01:09:44.023]  Can you imagine the threats we get?
[01:09:44.103 --> 01:09:44.784]  Can you imagine?
[01:09:45.524 --> 01:09:48.127]  Again, I've never seen this level of behavior.
[01:09:49.116 --> 01:09:50.897]  And the New York Times calling for Donald Trump to be killed.
[01:09:51.137 --> 01:10:02.080]  So I thought we'd play a little boil-down, because why this guy's even more interesting, not just for his cartoons, but all the predictions he's made that have come true, sometimes decades before.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.400]  Really uncanny.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.440]  So obviously a smart guy.
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:07.641]  We're gonna be going to him here in just a moment.
[01:10:07.681 --> 01:10:14.723]  Here's the short boil-down of Scott Adams, the creator and artist behind Dilbert, looking into his crystal ball.
[01:10:15.387 --> 01:10:17.369]  Joining me to talk Trump is Scott Adams.
[01:10:17.389 --> 01:10:19.091]  He's the creator of Dilbert.
[01:10:19.291 --> 01:10:24.096]  And Scott, on his blog, has been analyzing the rise of the Republican frontrunner for months now.
[01:10:24.416 --> 01:10:30.482]  And frankly, he has some of the most interesting and accurate observations about why Trump is appealing to so many people.
[01:10:30.882 --> 01:10:40.971]  And I called him to be the landslide winner in the general election last year because the tools he's using, essentially he's basically taking a flamethrower to a stick fight.
[01:10:41.411 --> 01:10:43.253]  There's nobody using the same tools he's using.
[01:10:43.553 --> 01:10:50.299]  So you have another theory about Trump saying that he uses certain words and almost hypnotizes the audience.
[01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:51.119]  What do you mean by that?
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:59.385]  So, for background, I'm a trained hypnotist and I've been studying persuasion all of my life as part of what I do for a living as a writer.
[01:11:00.086 --> 01:11:09.672]  And I noticed back in August of last year that Trump was using persuasion techniques to perfection when it looked like he was just a crazy clown saying random things.
[01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:16.176]  But if you look at his method from a trained persuader's point of view, it's been perfection from the beginning.
[01:11:16.657 --> 01:11:19.719]  It just looks random to someone who's not trained in how to persuade.
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:25.322]  Are actually part of the persuasion because he doesn't give you targets.
[01:11:25.362 --> 01:11:35.206]  He doesn't give you details of his policies usually so he's Reducing the number of targets while making you feel good and focus on the things he wants.
[01:11:35.726 --> 01:11:38.287]  So it's not about facts It's about focus and attention.
[01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:44.230]  Is this like what you're talking about when you say like the linguistic kill shot whether calling Jeb Bush low energy or something else?
[01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:51.252]  Yeah, so the linguistic kill shot is finding some kind of insult, if you can call it that, that sticks, like other insults would not.
[01:11:51.672 --> 01:11:56.794]  And he likes to pick things that are visual, you look at the person and say, yeah, that feels kind of right.
[01:11:57.154 --> 01:12:03.936]  But he also picks words and phrases that haven't been used before, so they haven't been polluted by other meaning, which is a good technique.
[01:12:04.296 --> 01:12:08.317]  So when you say somebody's low energy, there's nobody else that you ever talked about like that.
[01:12:08.837 --> 01:12:16.859]  When I heard low energy, I called the end of Bush that day because that is a sticky insult.
[01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:18.079]  So these are not random insults.
[01:12:18.319 --> 01:12:19.300]  I'm not saying they're random.
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.640]  I'm not saying they don't work.
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.660]  I'm just saying he brands people.
[01:12:22.961 --> 01:12:25.541]  Low energy, crazy, crooked.
[01:12:25.581 --> 01:12:26.661]  No, but there's something else to it.
[01:12:26.962 --> 01:12:28.842]  He's working on confirmation bias.
[01:12:29.302 --> 01:12:36.324]  When you see anything come out in the news that looks like maybe Hillary Clinton did something a little bit suspicious, you say, crooked Hillary.
[01:12:36.804 --> 01:12:40.646]  The brilliant thing he did recently was he came up with a second one for Clinton.
[01:12:41.186 --> 01:12:42.367]  He said, well, is she heartless?
[01:12:42.867 --> 01:12:43.887]  Is it a heartless Hillary?
[01:12:44.388 --> 01:12:45.368]  Or is it a crooked Hillary?
[01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:50.751]  And he actually made people debate whether she was more heartless or more crooked.
[01:12:51.511 --> 01:12:52.691]  And that's all intentional.
[01:12:52.751 --> 01:12:53.872]  This is all technique.
[01:12:53.892 --> 01:12:56.533]  Democrats like to say that they'd love to run against Trump.
[01:12:57.173 --> 01:12:59.695]  You clearly think that they're underestimating him.
[01:13:00.615 --> 01:13:03.557]  Yeah, based on his talent stack alone.
[01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:08.760]  If you look at any individual talent he has, you could say, well, that's not the best in the world.
[01:13:09.041 --> 01:13:10.521]  But look how many he's put together.
[01:13:10.962 --> 01:13:12.883]  He knows strategy, business strategy.
[01:13:12.923 --> 01:13:13.984]  He knows negotiating.
[01:13:14.424 --> 01:13:16.745]  He's the best persuader I've ever seen.
[01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:18.146]  He's quick in his feet.
[01:13:18.186 --> 01:13:18.867]  He's funny.
[01:13:19.867 --> 01:13:21.248]  He's smart enough.
[01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:23.070]  He knows enough about politics.
[01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:26.812]  So when you put that stack together, nobody really stands up to that stack.
[01:13:27.332 --> 01:13:29.914]  I've been predicting he's going to win in a landslide since last year.
[01:13:30.174 --> 01:13:32.015]  Not just the nomination, but the presidency.
[01:13:32.556 --> 01:13:36.458]  Yeah, I think it'll be one of the biggest margins of victory in history.
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:39.460]  There you go.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.701]  Now Scott Adams joins us.
[01:13:40.721 --> 01:13:48.186]  Scott, I've got to say that I think a lot of what you would call trained programming
[01:13:49.378 --> 01:13:49.799]  Is that true?
[01:14:06.781 --> 01:14:07.781]  It is true she's crooked.
[01:14:08.101 --> 01:14:10.762]  It is true she's obviously got health problems, even Obama's doctor.
[01:14:10.782 --> 01:14:16.044]  I mean, I think what really makes Trump powerful is that he's telling the truth, and yet sometimes he does simplify it.
[01:14:16.064 --> 01:14:19.705]  What do you say, Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, blog.dilbert.com?
[01:14:20.425 --> 01:14:24.587]  Well, people can't tell the difference between the truth and something that's totally made up.
[01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:27.467]  That is one of the powers we don't possess.
[01:14:27.968 --> 01:14:32.029]  What we do instead, and this is something you need to understand to be a hypnotist,
[01:14:32.749 --> 01:14:34.770]  Is that people are irrational all the time.
[01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:39.291]  So what we really think is truth is usually confirmation bias.
[01:14:39.711 --> 01:14:48.613]  Now things can be true also by coincidence, but usually we individuals don't have access to the, you know, the base facts.
[01:14:48.753 --> 01:14:50.333]  We're just hearing it from somebody else.
[01:14:50.373 --> 01:14:52.834]  We're putting it together from clues in our environment.
[01:14:53.494 --> 01:14:57.295]  So most of what we recognize to be truth is really just confirmation bias.
[01:14:57.355 --> 01:14:59.195]  And this is true on both sides, by the way.
[01:14:59.375 --> 01:15:14.664]  I agree for the general dumbed down public, but we deal in the real, I mean I do, the real system, the real program of how culture is set up and operating and the different competing systems, and I find Trump to be very, very accurate.
[01:15:14.724 --> 01:15:15.824]  Very, very on target.
[01:15:16.225 --> 01:15:18.326]  I mean his speech in Mexico, that had a lot of facts in it.
[01:15:19.597 --> 01:15:30.502]  It did, and that's part of his persuasion, because if you look at what the other side was trying to do to him, they're persuaders, and I think there's one in particular who's probably behind it.
[01:15:31.023 --> 01:15:41.468]  I've speculated that Robert Cialdini, who's famous for writing the book Influence, who would be one of the best influencers in the world, might be consulting for Clinton.
[01:15:42.028 --> 01:15:43.349]  He did help
[01:15:44.349 --> 01:15:48.511]  Obama's campaign, so it would be odd if he wasn't helping this time as well.
[01:15:49.271 --> 01:16:01.837]  But the situation that they'd set up is a confirmation bias trap that they built around Trump that made his opponents think that everything he did was one of these things.
[01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:09.400]  It's either crazy or uninformed or it's racist or it's another sign of his thin skin and his bad temperament.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.521]  So they've set up
[01:16:11.281 --> 01:16:20.416]  A bunch of confirmation bias traps that everything he does can be interpreted to be one of those things if you're already inclined to think that way.
[01:16:20.736 --> 01:16:22.098]  So that's how persuasion works.
[01:16:22.539 --> 01:16:25.784]  It's the same technique that Trump uses in the other direction.
[01:16:26.505 --> 01:16:44.693]  But so what he needed to do to try to wiggle out of that trap is try to do anything that showed he is well-informed, at least on one topic, and I think having 10 bullet points and talking about it for, I don't know, how long you talk, 45 minutes or an hour, I think he sold that.
[01:16:45.353 --> 01:16:50.737]  So the people who said Trump can't learn, he doesn't care about the details, he's not serious.
[01:16:52.118 --> 01:16:56.562]  Wasn't it a daring and really smart move to go to New Orleans in the flooding when Hillary wouldn't?
[01:16:56.782 --> 01:16:59.384]  To go to Mexico and say, you know, get down here Hillary.
[01:17:00.725 --> 01:17:08.090]  Yeah, that's great optics because he's also working on the impression, which he's created, that Hillary doesn't have the stamina.
[01:17:08.631 --> 01:17:11.113]  Plus it looks presidential when he's standing next to a president.
[01:17:11.894 --> 01:17:18.078]  Yeah, so he's got all the optics right, and that also works toward the, is he a crazy racist?
[01:17:18.559 --> 01:17:22.942]  Because you see him talking to the President of Mexico, and the two of them are getting along fine.
[01:17:22.962 --> 01:17:25.524]  It didn't turn into a slap fight.
[01:17:25.544 --> 01:17:29.847]  The Mexican President's body language after the meeting was he really suddenly liked Trump.
[01:17:31.021 --> 01:17:34.864]  Well, everything I hear about Trump in person is that people do like him in person.
[01:17:35.925 --> 01:17:42.891]  His personality is a little bit different in public, and it's even different, again, at a rally than it is at a press conference.
[01:17:42.911 --> 01:17:47.996]  Yeah, now Trump, Trump, I mean the Trump people see on the trail and stuff is Trump, but
[01:17:49.056 --> 01:17:54.843]  The Trump behind the scenes is like, the guy's got amazing charisma, and he's very smart.
[01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:56.264]  That's what I hear.
[01:17:56.304 --> 01:18:01.230]  And by the way, the definition of charisma, according to the scientists, is kind of interesting.
[01:18:01.891 --> 01:18:07.377]  Charisma, say the experts, is a combination of power plus empathy.
[01:18:08.138 --> 01:18:10.120]  Now, he's already got the power.
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:12.062]  So people already saw that.
[01:18:12.242 --> 01:18:17.307]  And if they didn't see that, they saw him just annihilate the competitors in the primaries.
[01:18:17.767 --> 01:18:19.469]  And so now they believe he has power.
[01:18:19.509 --> 01:18:20.950]  Can't we have this guy as president?
[01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:22.111]  I mean, this is awesome!
[01:18:22.411 --> 01:18:23.532]  He's gotta be president.
[01:18:24.013 --> 01:18:25.174]  But hold on, part two.
[01:18:25.234 --> 01:18:26.635]  Part two is where his problem was.
[01:18:27.056 --> 01:18:30.219]  He had the power for charisma, but he lacked the empathy.
[01:18:30.779 --> 01:18:36.428]  Because he was taking a hard-nosed approach to immigration and other topics.
[01:18:37.049 --> 01:18:39.112]  And so that made him look like, well, maybe he's a little scared.
[01:18:39.132 --> 01:18:42.257]  But don't you think that's the tactic, is to be, you know, the good cop, bad cop.
[01:18:42.277 --> 01:18:43.659]  He's first the bad cop, now he's the good cop.
[01:18:45.365 --> 01:18:53.711]  I think he needed a different tactic in the primaries, of course, and he needed to soften it in the general, and he's well on his way to doing that.
[01:18:54.071 --> 01:18:57.694]  So I think his immigration speech was a huge step.
[01:18:58.375 --> 01:19:08.022]  Well, sir, Scott Adams, I would love to have you on sometime just about the technicals, being a hypnotist, all your amazing comics, Dilbert.com, blog.dilbert.com, but specifically, though,
[01:19:09.952 --> 01:19:17.160]  You saying you got so many threats, so you endorsed Hillary, and I can see here you're kind of, I don't want to say riding the rail, but I think you like Trump.
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:26.651]  I mean, I think it's obvious that you want Trump to be president, but in this media climate of censorship and persecution, you're just giving him backhanded compliments.
[01:19:27.438 --> 01:19:28.539]  That's not exactly true.
[01:19:29.059 --> 01:19:34.082]  I'm actually completely serious when I say that I'm endorsing Hillary Clinton for my physical safety.
[01:19:34.563 --> 01:19:35.223]  And it's working.
[01:19:35.823 --> 01:19:45.389]  So prior to saying that publicly, I was getting comments online, mostly on Twitter, comparing me to Joseph Goebbels, you know, Hitler's PR person.
[01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:50.533]  But in reality, it's Nazi Germany where you have to endorse Hitler or Hitler comes after you.
[01:19:51.734 --> 01:19:52.914]  Yeah, you could make that argument.
[01:19:53.175 --> 01:20:05.263]  But the point is that if I wanted to talk about Trump's persuasion skills, which is the thing that interested me and my audience, I couldn't do that with physical safety if people imagined that that also meant I backed his policies.
[01:20:05.743 --> 01:20:12.487]  And so let me say as clearly as I can that my personal political preferences don't align with either Clinton or Trump.
[01:20:12.627 --> 01:20:14.769]  I'm not very close to either of them on anything.
[01:20:15.890 --> 01:20:20.593]  So if you say who would I prefer to be president on an entertainment basis, of course Trump.
[01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:25.075]  On a policy basis, I'm not smart enough to know who's got the best policies.
[01:20:27.336 --> 01:20:43.142]  Bottom line, they're creating a new McCarthyism, but with no teeth, claiming that everyone, I mean Hillary has actually said in her speech when she attacked myself and others last week, that the alt-right and Breitbart and others and Trump
[01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:46.811]  Actually take orders from Vladimir Putin.
[01:20:46.931 --> 01:20:48.013]  I mean, I've never been to Russia.
[01:20:48.553 --> 01:20:49.314]  It's total bull.
[01:20:49.815 --> 01:20:50.776]  I've been on Russian TV.
[01:20:50.796 --> 01:20:53.079]  I've been on Japanese TV and British TV, more than Russian TV.
[01:20:53.119 --> 01:20:54.401]  I'm not taking orders from the British either.
[01:20:54.421 --> 01:20:55.502]  I've been on Mexican TV.
[01:20:55.523 --> 01:20:56.484]  I'm not taking orders from the Mexicans.
[01:20:56.744 --> 01:20:58.246]  I mean, this is a new level.
[01:20:58.506 --> 01:20:59.748]  Talk about conspiracy theories.
[01:21:00.609 --> 01:21:06.013]  She made up stuff that I supposedly stand for, or twisted it, and then said, what type of dark heart?
[01:21:06.053 --> 01:21:07.113]  I want to play this clip for you.
[01:21:07.294 --> 01:21:10.616]  What type of dark heart does Alex Jones have and clutched her heart?
[01:21:10.736 --> 01:21:11.817]  Clearly it was scripted.
[01:21:11.837 --> 01:21:18.161]  I want to ask you as a top hypnotist, I know you're famous for that as well, what you think of this bit of propaganda here it is.
[01:21:18.761 --> 01:21:26.967]  What happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that?
[01:21:28.103 --> 01:21:30.325]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:21:30.765 --> 01:21:35.710]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, Your reputation is amazing.
[01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:37.131]  I will not let you down.
[01:21:37.151 --> 01:21:42.396]  This from the man who wants to be President of the United States.
[01:21:43.797 --> 01:21:46.458]  And I'm told, we haven't found it yet, but I got tweets and calls about it.
[01:21:46.538 --> 01:21:49.220]  Obama shot his mouth off at some dinner about me last night.
[01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:54.622]  But, I mean, this is really getting weird when she's talking about dark hearts and clutching her heart.
[01:21:54.662 --> 01:21:57.703]  I mean, what do you make of that neuro-linguistic programming?
[01:21:58.344 --> 01:22:07.248]  So, you notice that right after the GOP convention, as soon as Trump got done talking, all the pundits started using the same word, dark.
[01:22:07.888 --> 01:22:08.930]  That's not a coincidence.
[01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:11.873]  That comes from somebody who's trained in persuasion on their side.
[01:22:12.293 --> 01:22:14.376]  And again, it's probably Gildini.
[01:22:15.417 --> 01:22:17.159]  And what Dark does is it primes you.
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:25.889]  And this is something Gildini writes about in his new book called Persuasion, which is coming out in a few weeks, and you should definitely buy it if you want to understand anything about the election.
[01:22:28.091 --> 01:22:32.916]  It sort of primes the viewer for anything that comes after fitting the mold of dark.
[01:22:33.616 --> 01:22:39.702]  So it's a linguistic kill shot of its own type, and it primes you to see everything in this tinged dark way.
[01:22:40.102 --> 01:22:50.812]  But you notice that six months ago, Clinton's selling points were, she's the one with the experience and the facts and the, you know, she's the rational one.
[01:22:51.332 --> 01:22:52.153]  She's the safe one.
[01:22:52.193 --> 01:22:55.796]  She's the steady hand, even though she starts all these illegal wars and creates failed states.
[01:22:56.376 --> 01:23:01.220]  Let's expand on that, because Assange, we have this clip coming up later after you leave us, but it's on Infowars.com.
[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:05.083]  WikiLeaks did a New York Times interview and he said, listen, this woman's a demon.
[01:23:05.123 --> 01:23:05.843]  I've got the email.
[01:23:05.883 --> 01:23:06.804]  She's super dangerous.
[01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:07.845]  She's a mobster.
[01:23:07.885 --> 01:23:09.606]  She's going to hang the press, because they are.
[01:23:09.646 --> 01:23:10.207]  I've got stacks.
[01:23:10.467 --> 01:23:14.108]  She said in a campaign letter, they're going to shut down the alt-conservatives.
[01:23:14.188 --> 01:23:15.569]  I mean, this is bold.
[01:23:15.609 --> 01:23:18.669]  I'm holding the Daily Caller article with the snippets of the email right here.
[01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:20.630]  They actually say, we have no right to exist.
[01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:21.910]  Talk about Hitlerian.
[01:23:22.090 --> 01:23:23.211]  Talk about final solution.
[01:23:23.651 --> 01:23:26.372]  And Assange says, he finally gave a hint.
[01:23:26.472 --> 01:23:30.353]  He said, well, a lot of it is how they're coordinating everything.
[01:23:30.413 --> 01:23:31.353]  It's all coordinated.
[01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:34.914]  Well, the earlier email showed that, where they're ordering everybody exactly what to do.
[01:23:35.234 --> 01:23:36.975]  I mean, this is not what you have in a free society.
[01:23:38.283 --> 01:23:47.547]  Well, let me say, you're talking maybe about the Wikileaks memo about CNN and their producers talking in advance with, before the interviews.
[01:23:47.887 --> 01:23:48.688]  That's what you're talking about?
[01:23:48.708 --> 01:23:49.228]  There's a bunch of them.
[01:23:49.248 --> 01:23:50.228]  There's thousands of these.
[01:23:50.248 --> 01:23:52.009]  Yes, but coordinating what to do.
[01:23:52.029 --> 01:23:56.871]  I mean, you pointed out how within one minute of the end of Trump's speech, it was dark, dark, dark everywhere.
[01:23:57.192 --> 01:23:58.172]  Articles already written.
[01:23:58.652 --> 01:23:59.753]  These talking points go out.
[01:24:00.413 --> 01:24:07.838]  All right, but let me say just on the point of CNN and their producers, it is normal business for them to discuss in advance what the questions are.
[01:24:07.858 --> 01:24:10.079]  They do that with me, they do that with most of the guests.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:19.085]  I don't know that they would do that with the, you know, if they had one of the candidates on, there might be more preparation there.
[01:24:19.265 --> 01:24:21.347]  Or less preparation, just so they could surprise us.
[01:24:21.367 --> 01:24:22.687]  There's more coordination than that.
[01:24:22.707 --> 01:24:27.370]  I mean, they were like sending people to go after Trump with Bernie Sanders, people dressed up as Bernie Sanders supporters.
[01:24:27.571 --> 01:24:28.411]  There's a lot of coordination.
[01:24:28.431 --> 01:24:29.172]  I'm not sure what she meant.
[01:24:29.992 --> 01:24:30.733]  Sure, yeah.
[01:24:31.134 --> 01:24:34.920]  I'm not saying that there isn't some of that going on, but there's also some confirmation bias.
[01:24:36.001 --> 01:24:38.225]  We see it where it isn't, as well as where it is.
[01:24:38.585 --> 01:24:39.326]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:24:39.607 --> 01:24:44.153]  And for folks that don't know about that particular term, why don't you define it for them?
[01:24:45.222 --> 01:24:55.624]  So confirmation bias is where you've already made up your mind that something's true, and then any evidence you see in your environment, whether it supports that fact or not, you imagine that it does.
[01:24:56.104 --> 01:25:07.526]  So if, for imagine, you've decided that Trump is a racist, then if he talks about something like border security, which really doesn't have anything to do with the race, it's just something you do with all your borders all the time, every country.
[01:25:07.646 --> 01:25:08.226]  Sovereignty.
[01:25:09.026 --> 01:25:13.527]  Then you just say to yourself, well that's probably another example of him being a racist, because I already decided he was.
[01:25:15.147 --> 01:25:21.494]  Yeah, that's as made up as it could be.
[01:25:21.854 --> 01:25:31.304]  But on the Clinton side, there's clearly some coordination with the mainstream media, but probably a little bit, you know, over-imagined as well.
[01:25:34.656 --> 01:25:39.357]  Two years ago, Congress legalized the CIA and being involved in domestic propaganda operations.
[01:25:40.318 --> 01:25:41.558]  They call it propaganda placement.
[01:25:41.578 --> 01:25:42.498]  Well, I coined that term.
[01:25:42.718 --> 01:25:44.239]  They call it behavior placement.
[01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:51.981]  And Congress ruled it was illegal ten years ago and said stop funding it.
[01:25:53.002 --> 01:25:54.482]  But it's only expanding.
[01:25:54.522 --> 01:25:56.062]  So I think there's deeper layers to this.
[01:25:56.443 --> 01:26:03.905]  But obviously, this confirmation bias... You think the CIA is involved in trying to influence the election?
[01:26:04.966 --> 01:26:05.726]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:26:05.766 --> 01:26:09.769]  Here, I mean, they've had the former CIA directors and others come out and demonize Trump.
[01:26:10.349 --> 01:26:13.090]  We actually, I have the Washington Post on screen.
[01:26:13.551 --> 01:26:13.751]  U.S.
[01:26:13.811 --> 01:26:16.532]  repeals propaganda ban, spreads government-made news to Americans.
[01:26:16.592 --> 01:26:17.973]  I mean, it's full on.
[01:26:19.244 --> 01:26:22.546]  Well, the government made news is for which purpose?
[01:26:22.566 --> 01:26:25.487]  I mean, that doesn't necessarily mean it's necessary.
[01:26:25.507 --> 01:26:28.608]  Two years ago, they authorized domestic PSYOP operations.
[01:26:29.069 --> 01:26:29.549]  It's a fact.
[01:26:29.609 --> 01:26:30.649]  I've interviewed the police chiefs.
[01:26:31.050 --> 01:26:35.812]  Everybody, Delta Force comes in with big bags of money, buys off the local mayor.
[01:26:36.592 --> 01:26:37.733]  It's all part of COG.
[01:26:38.293 --> 01:26:39.093]  For what messages?
[01:26:40.234 --> 01:26:43.676]  Just to be prepared during a collapse or civil emergency to go with
[01:26:44.696 --> 01:26:44.836]  Okay.
[01:26:44.896 --> 01:26:45.236]  I believe you.
[01:27:08.427 --> 01:27:14.910]  Do you think we're close to martial law and Obama trying to retain power?
[01:27:15.431 --> 01:27:30.579]  I don't think Obama's going to try to maintain power, but the establishment power structure, like Goldman Sachs that actually installs leaders, presidents and prime ministers in Greece and Italy now, at Davos, they've called for a move to technocracy and basically installing bank heads as presidents.
[01:27:33.962 --> 01:27:37.348]  I think we ought to take a look at our system of government.
[01:27:38.089 --> 01:27:41.394]  If you ask me, it's already changed in ways that the founders didn't plan.
[01:27:41.434 --> 01:27:42.876]  Exactly, it's a soft martial law.
[01:27:43.567 --> 01:27:45.448]  Well, I'm going a different direction here.
[01:27:45.488 --> 01:27:54.054]  I'm saying that we're a republic by design, but because of the internet, a good idea can bubble up from any individual.
[01:27:54.074 --> 01:27:57.977]  If it gets viral, then the mainstream media has to pay attention to it.
[01:27:58.497 --> 01:28:01.459]  And if they pay attention to it, there's a good chance it's going to become policy.
[01:28:01.839 --> 01:28:08.204]  So I would argue that we have devolved into something closer to a direct democracy accidentally.
[01:28:09.793 --> 01:28:14.323]  Maybe a direct democracy of multinational corporations voting with their campaign contributions, but...
[01:28:15.034 --> 01:28:19.697]  No, but I think Trump signals the end of that model that you just described.
[01:28:19.717 --> 01:28:21.238]  I agree.
[01:28:21.758 --> 01:28:36.106]  So the old model, and by old I mean sort of right now, you know, last year's old, was that the lobbyists and the big money people were doing everything and selling it to the public as they had something to do with the decisions.
[01:28:37.247 --> 01:28:40.889]  But now, I think that's actually becoming true because of the internet.
[01:28:41.569 --> 01:28:44.531]  You can make enough noise on the internet, your argument can be good enough.
[01:28:44.551 --> 01:28:45.031]  Oh, I agree.
[01:28:45.051 --> 01:28:50.875]  There's a giant tsunami of awakening and human empowerment coming, but there isn't a totalitarian pushback to that.
[01:28:50.915 --> 01:28:51.616]  That's what I was getting at.
[01:28:51.636 --> 01:28:54.798]  Scott Adams, really smart guy, blog.dilbert.com.
[01:28:55.118 --> 01:28:56.979]  I hope you'll come back with us sometime in the future.
[01:28:57.479 --> 01:28:59.981]  Are you still predicting a landslide for Donald J. Trump?
[01:29:00.788 --> 01:29:10.654]  I am, based on technique, not policies, and it looks like Clinton's not going to make it to the end line, based on what she looked like yesterday.
[01:29:11.074 --> 01:29:17.137]  So, I don't think it's a conspiracy theory that she looks sick, even Obama's former doctor, who's a Democrat, is saying she looks really bad.
[01:29:18.458 --> 01:29:21.620]  Well, there's a lot of variability in her appearance, and that's what I pointed out.
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:23.941]  I'm not trying to be a doctor, I'm just making it sound safe.
[01:29:23.961 --> 01:29:25.002]  Yeah, she looks like hell.
[01:29:25.062 --> 01:29:26.462]  Scott Adams, one last question.
[01:29:28.464 --> 01:29:32.989]  Are you concerned, or have you heard, Homeland Security now is going to step in and run the election for the first time ever?
[01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:34.791]  What?
[01:29:35.551 --> 01:29:36.072]  I'm not kidding.
[01:29:36.092 --> 01:29:36.472]  Look it up!
[01:29:37.338 --> 01:29:38.978]  Homeland Security is going to run the election.
[01:29:39.219 --> 01:29:39.699]  Yes, sir.
[01:29:39.739 --> 01:29:40.119]  Here's the deal.
[01:29:40.179 --> 01:29:41.339]  You have a normalcy bias.
[01:29:42.019 --> 01:29:45.160]  Because you're a good guy, you don't think as evil as these people do.
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:51.262]  Even though you're sophisticated and smart, I'm asking you to see that confirmation bias that's even bigger because you're not a psychopath.
[01:29:51.662 --> 01:29:52.862]  I really appreciate your time, sir.
[01:29:52.902 --> 01:29:53.862]  I look forward to speaking to you again.
[01:29:53.882 --> 01:29:54.743]  All right.
[01:29:54.803 --> 01:29:55.543]  Thank you for having me.
[01:29:55.583 --> 01:29:56.543]  Very informative guy.
[01:29:56.583 --> 01:29:57.203]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:57.223 --> 01:29:57.944]  Thought-provoking.
[01:29:57.964 --> 01:29:58.344]  Stay with us.
[01:29:58.384 --> 01:29:59.164]  Huge news straight ahead.
[01:29:59.964 --> 01:30:00.944]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.365 --> 01:30:02.965]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.885 --> 01:30:06.566]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.623 --> 01:30:19.654]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:30:19.734 --> 01:30:27.784]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:30:28.124 --> 01:30:32.826]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:30:33.006 --> 01:30:39.708]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:39.788 --> 01:30:46.871]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:30:46.971 --> 01:30:53.813]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:30:53.993 --> 01:30:58.338]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:30:58.458 --> 01:31:01.722]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:31:01.862 --> 01:31:07.989]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:31:08.169 --> 01:31:09.831]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[01:31:10.512 --> 01:31:19.880]  The House Oversight Committee Chairman and the House Judiciary Committee Chairman are both raising the issue of whether Hillary Clinton committed perjury when she testified under oath to Congress.
[01:31:20.081 --> 01:31:26.426]  The discrepancies between what she said and what FBI Director Comey said are obvious even to the casual observer.
[01:31:26.666 --> 01:31:32.712]  But you may say, because the Justice Department is so politicized, they won't ever prosecute Hillary for crimes she commits.
[01:31:32.932 --> 01:31:33.492]  And you're right.
[01:31:33.692 --> 01:31:48.056]  But the president of Judicial Watch, which has been at the forefront of investigating the corruption and the national security violations of Hillary Clinton, points out in an interview with the Daily Mail, quote, one of the dirty little secrets in Washington is that Mrs. Clinton can be impeached now.
[01:31:48.356 --> 01:31:54.518]  A federal official leaving office does not end congressional jurisdiction over impeachment for misconduct in that office.
[01:31:54.858 --> 01:32:00.027]  And if Hillary was convicted by the Senate, the sanction could be indefinitely for future office.
[01:32:00.789 --> 01:32:03.073]  Will Congress grow a spine and check the corruption?
[01:32:03.393 --> 01:32:06.098]  If they don't do it in an election year, they won't ever.
[01:32:06.198 --> 01:32:08.042]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:32:10.333 --> 01:32:14.716]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:32:14.796 --> 01:32:25.722]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:32:25.882 --> 01:32:30.824]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:32:30.944 --> 01:32:33.445]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:32:33.525 --> 01:32:35.006]  It helps detoxify.
[01:32:35.226 --> 01:32:38.047]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:32:38.127 --> 01:32:42.869]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:32:42.889 --> 01:32:49.132]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:32:49.152 --> 01:32:54.455]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:32:54.475 --> 01:32:55.255]  I'm taking it now.
[01:32:55.555 --> 01:32:57.776]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[01:32:57.796 --> 01:32:58.896]  Americanism, not globalism!
[01:33:24.586 --> 01:33:28.630]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[01:33:28.931 --> 01:33:35.057]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[01:33:35.397 --> 01:33:42.944]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure, wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
[01:33:43.285 --> 01:33:48.090]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better.
[01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:51.634]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[01:34:04.051 --> 01:34:06.192]  Right here in Detroit.
[01:34:06.332 --> 01:34:11.953]  It's all training us to accept less, lowering expectations, a post-industrial world, a new dark age.
[01:34:12.114 --> 01:34:15.915]  That's what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[01:34:16.195 --> 01:34:19.616]  When we abandon the policy of America first,
[01:34:20.456 --> 01:34:24.479]  We started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.
[01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:28.982]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger.
[01:34:29.262 --> 01:34:31.964]  A world that gets uglier and stupider and more stunted.
[01:34:35.666 --> 01:34:38.069]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[01:34:38.309 --> 01:34:42.513]  Well, I voted for Hillary.
[01:34:42.713 --> 01:34:44.755]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[01:34:45.056 --> 01:34:46.978]  You want an image of the future, Winston?
[01:34:47.178 --> 01:34:49.340]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:55.827]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[01:34:56.067 --> 01:35:00.548]  Women are treated, discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[01:35:00.868 --> 01:35:04.348]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[01:35:04.408 --> 01:35:05.329]  They're mistreated.
[01:35:05.969 --> 01:35:07.329]  She claims to be their champion.
[01:35:07.709 --> 01:35:16.311]  Don't look at me, Winston, and see the black circles around my eyes, and see how ugly and weak I am, expressing myself and dying, and I torture people 18 hours a day, and I have a horrible life!
[01:35:16.551 --> 01:35:20.791]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power, ripping apart humanity!
[01:35:20.811 --> 01:35:22.172]  We're here to hurt humans!
[01:35:22.292 --> 01:35:23.752]  We're here to suck your guts out!
[01:35:24.992 --> 01:35:31.053]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:35:36.174 --> 01:35:42.416]  Laura Southern is probably one of the most censored people on a regular basis that I see.
[01:35:43.876 --> 01:35:47.617]  And the reason she is is she's eloquent, she's smart, she's attractive.
[01:35:48.911 --> 01:35:56.834]  And she's aggressively, in a friendly way, going out and showing what horrible bullies social justice warriors are.
[01:35:56.854 --> 01:36:03.136]  There was a video that we aired a few days ago that she first brought to our attention.
[01:36:03.196 --> 01:36:04.357]  Others have reported on it as well.
[01:36:04.537 --> 01:36:05.517]  And that's important to note.
[01:36:06.797 --> 01:36:16.101]  With this horrible woman, who is a public figure, a feminist, runs a feminist organization, coming out and bullying for six minutes,
[01:36:17.327 --> 01:36:20.249]  A poor taxi driver, or Lyft driver.
[01:36:23.852 --> 01:36:25.593]  The video's on Infowars.com if you missed it.
[01:36:26.214 --> 01:36:27.254]  It's actually hard to watch.
[01:36:27.975 --> 01:36:30.417]  Her voice is like nails on a chalkboard.
[01:36:31.718 --> 01:36:42.005]  And the headline of the article is, Snake-Like Bully Harasses Lyft Driver Over Hula Girl.
[01:36:42.886 --> 01:36:44.227]  That's my headline, I had it changed.
[01:36:44.267 --> 01:36:46.449]  It was Social Justice Warrior
[01:36:48.237 --> 01:36:50.118]  Flips out over a hula girl.
[01:36:50.399 --> 01:36:52.140]  But really, it's just a snake-like creature.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:57.203]  And when you hear her hissing voice, and how ignorant she is, and how entitled, and then it is the definition.
[01:36:57.223 --> 01:37:02.407]  You could teach a college course on psychology and projection on this lady.
[01:37:02.587 --> 01:37:08.651]  Everything she's saying to the poor, polite man, who is incredibly professional the entire time.
[01:37:09.112 --> 01:37:12.414]  I'm sorry, I'd be, get out of the car in about 30 seconds.
[01:37:12.434 --> 01:37:13.295]  You don't like the hula girl?
[01:37:13.435 --> 01:37:13.815]  Get out!
[01:37:14.896 --> 01:37:17.358]  That is my right to do if I don't like who's in my cab.
[01:37:18.277 --> 01:37:20.118]  And people need to stand up to these bullies.
[01:37:21.418 --> 01:37:24.559]  Now, they shut down her YouTube channel.
[01:37:24.579 --> 01:37:27.240]  I don't know if she's gotten it back yet, but they've shut her down on Twitter.
[01:37:28.041 --> 01:37:29.961]  She's been shut down for the mildest stuff.
[01:37:30.021 --> 01:37:37.384]  You know, you go out and show some so-called feminists marching around acting like idiots, screaming and yelling that, you know, men are all evil, and oh, just shut your channel down.
[01:37:39.005 --> 01:37:42.886]  And don't worry, the YouTube diversity team, we have it on screen for TV viewers,
[01:37:45.273 --> 01:37:53.280]  She sent a message back to the bully and said, oh yes, we looked at your video, or we looked at Laura Southern's video and, you know, we've had her removed.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:03.649]  And then, Annalise, the bully, sends Laura Southern a tweet and says bye bye in French to your YouTube channel.
[01:38:06.011 --> 01:38:06.512]  You bully.
[01:38:08.551 --> 01:38:09.892]  Ah, I'm destroying your livelihood.
[01:38:09.912 --> 01:38:11.532]  I'm trying to cut you off reaching the people.
[01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:13.593]  When you politely showed what a bully I am.
[01:38:13.913 --> 01:38:17.274]  And the bullies, the other social justice warriors that are going to manage things at YouTube, they agree.
[01:38:17.434 --> 01:38:19.255]  And now YouTube's come out today, DrugsReport.com.
[01:38:19.275 --> 01:38:20.275]  We're going right to Laura.
[01:38:20.855 --> 01:38:33.580]  DrugsReport.com, and I'm going to set this up, has dead center our story that YouTube has announced new terms of service where their little social justice diversity team, if they don't like what your site says, they're going to demonetize you.
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:34.840]  They're still going to take the money.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.041]  They're not going to give you your 30, 40 percent or whatever.
[01:38:39.588 --> 01:38:44.911]  So this is how they're going to enforce it, and that's the Chinese model that they brought in with this social score.
[01:38:46.712 --> 01:38:53.416]  The BBC thinks it's a great idea and called it a social credit system that took over the internet and monitors everything you do and tracks you.
[01:38:53.596 --> 01:38:54.257]  That alone is 1984.
[01:38:54.357 --> 01:38:54.517]  And then...
[01:38:58.032 --> 01:39:03.754]  It basically puts you in an electronic gulag and then they say in China the next step is no job in the real world.
[01:39:04.114 --> 01:39:05.194]  So Laura Southern joins us.
[01:39:05.615 --> 01:39:06.815]  I appreciate her coming on.
[01:39:07.735 --> 01:39:08.456]  Simply amazing.
[01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:09.756]  TheRebel.media.
[01:39:09.976 --> 01:39:10.616]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:39:10.856 --> 01:39:12.237]  You are such an evil person.
[01:39:13.658 --> 01:39:14.658]  I am an evil person.
[01:39:14.718 --> 01:39:16.739]  Yeah, this morning you're talking about me getting censored.
[01:39:16.759 --> 01:39:18.219]  I'm now officially banned.
[01:39:18.439 --> 01:39:22.840]  I'm not sure if it's from Sky News in general, but Kay Burley's show for sure.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.140]  I'm a evil racist, according to them.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:27.921]  So that's just one other thing I'm banned from.
[01:39:28.121 --> 01:39:34.182]  Luckily I still have my YouTube channel, but it's interesting, that video was shared on a very large channel, Philip DeFranco.
[01:39:34.202 --> 01:39:37.303]  It got more views than my video I uploaded did.
[01:39:37.803 --> 01:39:39.123]  And that's when they started.
[01:39:39.143 --> 01:39:43.304]  He's had a great relationship with YouTube for 10 years, been one of their first creators, biggest creators.
[01:39:43.763 --> 01:39:53.768]  As soon as he uploaded that video of Annalise saying she was a bad feminist and he never talks about this social justice stuff quite like that, they started demonetizing all his stuff and they took down 12 of his videos.
[01:39:53.788 --> 01:39:55.789]  Okay, well she was bragging she took you down for a while.
[01:39:55.849 --> 01:39:57.330]  I mean, was she even wrong about that?
[01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.930]  I know she tried.
[01:39:58.570 --> 01:39:58.930]  She was.
[01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:59.851]  She was wrong about that.
[01:39:59.891 --> 01:40:06.094]  What happened actually is Annalise deleted her account the night that I uploaded everything.
[01:40:06.627 --> 01:40:13.913]  And someone stole her Twitter account and has been uploading a bunch of stuff under Annalise's name.
[01:40:14.654 --> 01:40:18.838]  Although Annalise has made a lot of attempts to destroy people's lives for sharing this video.
[01:40:18.878 --> 01:40:22.961]  She runs her feminist group in LA where she's kicked tons of people out.
[01:40:23.061 --> 01:40:25.804]  She's doxing anyone who questions her.
[01:40:26.004 --> 01:40:29.327]  She actually ran a... She'd pimp girls out.
[01:40:29.407 --> 01:40:33.711]  She runs like a kind of like sex ring and she's been revealing girls as
[01:40:34.421 --> 01:40:35.022]  I don't think so.
[01:40:50.033 --> 01:40:56.679]  Ah, so she's out bullying and then finally bullies come and take over her channel and then basically continue acting like she's been acting.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.542]  I tell you, Laura, I'm glad you can fill us in on all this.
[01:40:59.562 --> 01:41:02.665]  Do you agree with my statement that this is just epic projection?
[01:41:02.685 --> 01:41:11.293]  Because people that have watched the video and heard it, she's bullying and bullying and threatening his job and just all over this poor guy and cussing at him and then she's calling him a bully.
[01:41:13.435 --> 01:41:13.555]  Oh no.
[01:41:16.038 --> 01:41:18.960]  We may have had her Skype drop for a moment.
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:20.040]  Are you back?
[01:41:21.621 --> 01:41:22.281]  Uh, just one minute.
[01:41:23.202 --> 01:41:24.523]  That's alright, we can interview you sideways.
[01:41:26.264 --> 01:41:28.965]  I think she's at college during the lunch break in an office.
[01:41:29.305 --> 01:41:32.007]  Hard-working lady, Laura Southern is our guest.
[01:41:33.508 --> 01:41:35.549]  Let's go ahead and play the clip while we're getting her Skype on.
[01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:38.550]  This is just a portion of the hula girl.
[01:41:38.590 --> 01:41:38.911]  Here it is.
[01:41:39.531 --> 01:41:41.272]  You thought that was adorable.
[01:41:41.332 --> 01:41:43.813]  You didn't think about the pillaging of food.
[01:41:45.529 --> 01:41:48.930]  I didn't even know there was a village named that.
[01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:49.110]  Um, no.
[01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:52.491]  I'm not going to not get rid of it because it's nice.
[01:41:52.531 --> 01:41:56.233]  I just don't realize it was offensive anyway.
[01:42:06.559 --> 01:42:12.601]  But so obviously like you as like a white male, you're like the least like... But now you're judging me, you're assuming where I'm from.
[01:42:12.661 --> 01:42:13.622]  No, I'm not.
[01:42:13.842 --> 01:42:14.902]  I'm not judging you.
[01:42:14.942 --> 01:42:21.244]  I'm just saying like that perhaps like you might be the person who is least heard in this situation.
[01:42:21.264 --> 01:42:30.448]  I'm a passenger in your car, like that doll is offensive to me, but you don't want to take it down because you like found it at Goodwill and it was such a good find.
[01:42:35.481 --> 01:42:40.183]  By the way, while we're getting her Skype back connected, it's a famous Texas thing.
[01:42:40.203 --> 01:42:41.324]  I don't know why we do it.
[01:42:41.364 --> 01:42:43.144]  We call the road Manchaca.
[01:42:43.945 --> 01:42:44.545]  Manchac.
[01:42:46.166 --> 01:42:48.827]  Everyone in East Texas always called me Ellick or Alec.
[01:42:49.487 --> 01:42:50.307]  They couldn't say Alex.
[01:42:50.608 --> 01:42:54.369]  And I know her name is Lauren, not Laura, but I'm calling her Laura Southern.
[01:42:54.409 --> 01:42:55.730]  It's Lauren Southern.
[01:42:57.010 --> 01:42:58.951]  I got a lot of stuff going on in my brain, though, obviously, folks.
[01:42:59.871 --> 01:43:01.012]  And we're teleprompter free here.
[01:43:02.052 --> 01:43:03.433]  But I wanted to have her on.
[01:43:04.946 --> 01:43:07.628]  Talk about this because look at all the censorship that's coming in.
[01:43:07.688 --> 01:43:10.349]  Look at the censorship that's intensifying.
[01:43:10.770 --> 01:43:14.932]  Look at the Trump guy who saved the baby in the hot car.
[01:43:14.952 --> 01:43:26.099]  And when they had him on CNN or Headline News, CNN's so mistrusted they're trying to, you know, rebrand themselves the last five, six years.
[01:43:26.419 --> 01:43:27.340]  When they first had him on,
[01:43:28.311 --> 01:43:34.295]  It was live and it said Trump 2016, but the next time they re-aired it, it was gone.
[01:43:34.335 --> 01:43:36.877]  They had simply blurted out like you do in the Soviet Union.
[01:43:38.158 --> 01:43:43.021]  So they invite you on to get their ratings and then they disrespect you, won't even let you have what's on your shirt.
[01:43:43.102 --> 01:43:49.166]  I mean, if somebody has something on a shirt that I didn't want, I'd be honest with them and say change that shirt if it was like cuss words or something, but it's not.
[01:43:50.647 --> 01:43:57.652]  So you disrespect people and you disrespect your viewers because you're not going to let a hero be associated with Donald J. Trump.
[01:43:59.784 --> 01:44:02.605]  Simply par for the course.
[01:44:02.785 --> 01:44:05.006]  And people say, well, this will wake everybody up.
[01:44:05.126 --> 01:44:06.126]  This has got a backfire on them.
[01:44:06.166 --> 01:44:15.170]  The problem is, over time, we'll just get acclimated to accepting that.
[01:44:17.651 --> 01:44:23.673]  I want to, since we're on this subject, play a clip
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:26.760]  That's comical from Trump.
[01:44:27.521 --> 01:44:34.403]  That he knows is so funny, it'll be hard for them not to be able to air it.
[01:44:34.423 --> 01:44:37.744]  Because Trump's biggest problem is they won't play large clips of what he has to say now.
[01:44:38.524 --> 01:44:41.945]  They do that with Hillary, but she already comes out from under a rock to do that.
[01:44:44.026 --> 01:44:47.127]  But I love this clip where he says maybe ICE will deport Hillary Clinton.
[01:44:47.727 --> 01:44:51.588]  He said this after he traveled to Mexico when he went to Arizona to give a speech there.
[01:44:51.608 --> 01:44:54.709]  And I have to tell you, I liked
[01:44:58.473 --> 01:45:07.155]  What Manafort was doing for the Trump campaign, helping him get some grassroots money, some organization, stop the steal at the primary level.
[01:45:07.475 --> 01:45:08.575]  That's what he was really an expert at.
[01:45:09.096 --> 01:45:20.218]  But Steven Bannon, and I can tell you other people close to Trump say this as well, is really responsive and is working 20 hours a day and doing an amazing, amazing job.
[01:45:21.358 --> 01:45:23.679]  And that comes from a lot of folks.
[01:45:25.982 --> 01:45:26.202]  That's
[01:45:45.291 --> 01:45:48.414]  12, and Trump's opening an automobile manufacturing facility.
[01:45:49.094 --> 01:45:52.097]  Now, will he end up being the biggest like Henry Ford?
[01:45:52.558 --> 01:45:53.639]  Is he launching too early?
[01:45:53.659 --> 01:45:55.881]  Or is he launching right on time?
[01:45:55.901 --> 01:46:05.430]  I mean, he believes people are ready to have nationalism and sovereignty and wealth and a program of wealth and independence.
[01:46:05.490 --> 01:46:06.491]  The globalists want us poor.
[01:46:06.651 --> 01:46:07.492]  They want to control us.
[01:46:07.532 --> 01:46:08.213]  They admit that.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:12.463]  Looks like we lost Laura Southern's connection.
[01:46:13.023 --> 01:46:15.826]  Your computer may have died, so we're going to move on at that point.
[01:46:16.266 --> 01:46:18.328]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[01:46:18.368 --> 01:46:19.870]  Maybe ICE will deport Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:21.452 --> 01:46:26.497]  We are going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.
[01:46:29.795 --> 01:46:51.247]  Within ICE, I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice, just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, okay?
[01:47:00.777 --> 01:47:02.819]  Maybe they'll be able to deport her!
[01:47:05.681 --> 01:47:07.762]  That is presidential material right there.
[01:47:10.424 --> 01:47:13.847]  That's what a president looks like, acts like, and does.
[01:47:14.788 --> 01:47:15.368]  Stamina.
[01:47:15.989 --> 01:47:16.669]  Alpha male.
[01:47:17.210 --> 01:47:17.950]  Successful.
[01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:19.291]  Loves America.
[01:47:19.691 --> 01:47:20.432]  Loves freedom.
[01:47:20.932 --> 01:47:22.894]  Loves wealth for the general public.
[01:47:23.174 --> 01:47:24.435]  Believes in a growing pie.
[01:47:28.518 --> 01:47:28.818]  Drinks...
[01:47:30.003 --> 01:47:31.264]  And Trump's never said this to some people that know him.
[01:47:31.284 --> 01:47:40.911]  He drinks gallons of milk a day, steaks, big things of vegetables, doesn't take aspirin, doesn't take vaccines, none of it.
[01:47:44.033 --> 01:47:47.836]  And they spun it like he's unhealthy because his doctor said, look, I could have wrote that letter better.
[01:47:48.136 --> 01:47:52.939]  When I write these for people, I write it real quick.
[01:47:55.161 --> 01:47:57.863]  But he is in really great shape for someone his age.
[01:48:00.170 --> 01:48:04.013]  I mean, he's as good a shape as you get at that age.
[01:48:04.033 --> 01:48:05.214]  I mean, look at Trump.
[01:48:05.234 --> 01:48:05.334]  He's 70.
[01:48:05.374 --> 01:48:09.957]  I mean, he's wearing body armor, so it looks like he's a little bit fatter than he is.
[01:48:09.977 --> 01:48:10.337]  He's not.
[01:48:13.139 --> 01:48:13.879]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:48:14.179 --> 01:48:15.640]  Just look at him compared to Hillary.
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:16.661]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:48:16.681 --> 01:48:18.142]  This is hands down.
[01:48:18.162 --> 01:48:24.686]  I mean, if Hillary was like some libertarian or patriot woman and smart and, you know, I don't care if they're beautiful or not.
[01:48:24.926 --> 01:48:25.226]  Great.
[01:48:25.286 --> 01:48:26.147]  Give me a woman right now.
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:31.040]  This is really a joke.
[01:48:31.361 --> 01:48:39.564]  I mean, this is a gigantic joke, and they're betting the farm on the fact that she's a woman, and it's this gimmick, and we gotta do it.
[01:48:40.504 --> 01:48:46.747]  Now, I want to come back after this break with an extremely powerful clip of Julian Assange when he was being interviewed by the New York Times.
[01:48:48.707 --> 01:48:53.949]  And of course, the New York Times wrote an article about this and didn't, you know, get into any of these areas, and now they're calling him a kook, a loon.
[01:48:54.630 --> 01:48:55.430]  He puts out leaks.
[01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:56.430]  He puts out real info.
[01:48:57.211 --> 01:48:57.791]  None of it's true.
[01:48:59.241 --> 01:49:03.803]  They got assassins climbing the window and killing over there at the embassy in London.
[01:49:05.724 --> 01:49:06.764]  This is amazing.
[01:49:06.784 --> 01:49:08.285]  And he says, this woman is a demon.
[01:49:08.305 --> 01:49:08.805]  Do you understand?
[01:49:09.986 --> 01:49:18.670]  And all I can tell Assange is, too calculated a blow a lot of times misses.
[01:49:19.570 --> 01:49:21.671]  I would start firing torpedoes every day.
[01:49:23.832 --> 01:49:28.113]  I would just Chinese water torture this and just drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.
[01:49:28.633 --> 01:49:30.874]  But I wouldn't save the best till last.
[01:49:32.554 --> 01:49:35.035]  I would fire now.
[01:49:37.435 --> 01:49:37.655]  Now.
[01:49:39.076 --> 01:49:41.656]  Like on a Tuesday morning.
[01:49:43.497 --> 01:49:45.817]  So that there's no way they can cover it up rather than the weekend.
[01:49:46.297 --> 01:49:50.538]  And then to coordinate and say it's time to take down the demon and start your engines.
[01:49:50.558 --> 01:49:52.259]  Because he's like, well, if the mainstream media picks this up,
[01:49:53.143 --> 01:49:54.224]  She'll have to go down.
[01:49:54.284 --> 01:49:54.804]  She's a criminal.
[01:49:55.365 --> 01:49:57.747]  They're not going to pick it up or they're going to spin it.
[01:49:58.668 --> 01:50:06.234]  You got Nancy Pelosi emails, you know, with her national security advisor to her going, yes, our policy, ma'am, is to back Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:50:06.274 --> 01:50:06.914]  And they're taking over.
[01:50:06.934 --> 01:50:07.775]  And that's what Hillary's doing.
[01:50:07.795 --> 01:50:10.597]  And because, you know, behind the closed doors, they have to know what the policy is.
[01:50:10.617 --> 01:50:14.400]  I mean, hell, the CFR wrote articles three years ago saying we need Al Qaeda.
[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:15.181]  They're good.
[01:50:15.201 --> 01:50:19.624]  It's no secret.
[01:50:20.834 --> 01:50:23.956]  The media spun it where it was something about, you know, side issue about Pelosi.
[01:50:23.976 --> 01:50:27.279]  It was just some little corner of the memo, not even about what it was about.
[01:50:27.319 --> 01:50:31.162]  It's like there's this instinct to never go with the heart of what something is.
[01:50:36.646 --> 01:50:39.849]  I'm not going to sit here and belabor the products.
[01:50:40.269 --> 01:50:46.173]  We set out to have the very best nutraceuticals, the vitamins, the minerals, the supplements that we can produce, and our
[01:50:47.188 --> 01:50:48.869]  New selenium that came out.
[01:50:48.929 --> 01:50:50.870]  Bio-true selenium is incredibly absorbable.
[01:50:51.010 --> 01:50:52.010]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:50:53.071 --> 01:50:55.772]  And it's from the mustard seed.
[01:50:56.172 --> 01:50:57.933]  And just go research what selenium does, folks.
[01:50:58.633 --> 01:50:59.774]  It's a game changer.
[01:50:59.834 --> 01:51:00.174]  You need it.
[01:51:00.234 --> 01:51:01.735]  And we need the funds to run the operation.
[01:51:01.775 --> 01:51:02.555]  It's a 360 win.
[01:51:02.855 --> 01:51:05.016]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:51:05.037 --> 01:51:06.017]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:51:06.057 --> 01:51:09.158]  We have Hill River Prison shirts at cost.
[01:51:09.399 --> 01:51:10.079]  $9.95 shipping included.
[01:51:10.499 --> 01:51:11.921]  Folks, the message is clear.
[01:51:12.321 --> 01:51:13.523]  The parallels are there.
[01:51:13.803 --> 01:51:25.316]  There are millions of ordinary Americans who've been let down, who've had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington are detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives are
[01:51:25.316 --> 01:51:29.359]  You are politically correct parts of that liberal media elite.
[01:51:29.719 --> 01:51:36.844]  They feel people aren't standing up for them and they've actually, in many cases, given up on the whole electoral process.
[01:51:36.904 --> 01:51:42.768]  And I think that you have a fantastic opportunity here with this campaign.
[01:51:43.228 --> 01:51:44.029]  You can go out.
[01:51:44.509 --> 01:51:45.930]  You can beat the pollsters.
[01:51:46.510 --> 01:51:48.212]  You can beat the commentators.
[01:51:48.712 --> 01:51:49.953]  You can beat Washington.
[01:51:50.413 --> 01:51:54.918]  Mr. Farage, you just recently resigned as the head of UKIP, still in the EU Parliament.
[01:51:55.439 --> 01:51:55.759]  Wow!
[01:51:55.819 --> 01:51:57.882]  Talk about a David versus Goliath story.
[01:51:58.202 --> 01:51:59.484]  This is epic.
[01:51:59.504 --> 01:52:10.776]  What it is, I think the point about Brexit, Alex, is Brexit is the first victory against this phenomenon of the big banks, the big businesses, effectively owning politics.
[01:52:11.697 --> 01:52:15.658]  Literally willfully destroying nation-state democracy.
[01:52:15.718 --> 01:52:21.780]  Getting rid of that thing that our forebears actually fought and shed their blood to create and to preserve.
[01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:31.843]  Our liberties, our freedoms, all of that being taken away and suddenly, suddenly in a referendum that no one said we could win.
[01:52:31.863 --> 01:52:36.984]  I mean literally nobody thought Brexit would succeed and we've done it.
[01:52:37.744 --> 01:52:39.165]  Hillary represents
[01:52:40.249 --> 01:52:44.253]  Everything that has gone wrong in our lives in the last couple of decades.
[01:52:44.794 --> 01:52:57.767]  She is part, you know, of that class of people who have taken us into an endless series of foreign wars that I think arguably have made things worse, certainly in Liberia and elsewhere, not better.
[01:52:58.588 --> 01:53:00.170]  She is part of that phenomenon.
[01:53:00.848 --> 01:53:04.730]  Where all that seems to matter now is corporatism.
[01:53:05.071 --> 01:53:12.875]  You know, the big global companies who want to set the rule books to effectively put out of business small and medium-sized competitors.
[01:53:13.395 --> 01:53:22.541]  They have destroyed, you know, what I believe to be proper free market capitalism where your eye can go and set up a company, you know, and have a real chance of succeeding.
[01:53:23.081 --> 01:53:32.129]  And they've presided over a period where the rich have got richer, and where ordinary, decent, working people have seen their living standards deteriorate.
[01:53:32.489 --> 01:53:34.231]  She represents failure.
[01:53:34.451 --> 01:53:41.777]  And she, of course, is completely unreconciled to the vote on Brexit, because Hillary loves the European Union.
[01:53:42.118 --> 01:53:48.163]  I think she sees the European Union as a prototype for an even bigger form of world government.
[01:53:48.303 --> 01:53:49.464]  But let me make it clear.
[01:53:50.254 --> 01:54:04.571]  If you want nothing to change at all, if you want to continue with the kind of cronyism that we see with the Clinton Foundation and everything else, if you want things to stay the same, you vote for Hillary.
[01:54:04.992 --> 01:54:09.177]  I wouldn't vote for Hillary if she paid me, and I feel pretty strongly about that.
[01:54:36.329 --> 01:54:41.053]  By the way, we're not going to be able to fund this operation if I only plug 20 seconds each hour.
[01:54:41.413 --> 01:54:42.714]  Other shows plug every segment.
[01:54:43.294 --> 01:54:46.076]  But then every few weeks I do like a 20 minute infomercial to try to fund us.
[01:54:47.077 --> 01:54:51.080]  All I can, we just do things different here and it's worked while the rest of media is going bankrupt.
[01:54:53.516 --> 01:54:55.497]  I should just encourage everybody to buy the products.
[01:54:55.517 --> 01:54:56.278]  They really are good.
[01:54:56.838 --> 01:54:59.139]  History's happening with the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:06.544]  And whereas I'd like to sell them for $19.95 and be able to fund the operation, I know that we sell ten times more when I sell them at cost.
[01:55:07.304 --> 01:55:12.287]  So I'd rather lose the $10 and make no money and have these flood the streets and defeat Hillary.
[01:55:12.808 --> 01:55:18.311]  But it is a Catch-22, so I don't sit here and calculate stuff out.
[01:55:18.351 --> 01:55:20.532]  I just go with my gut and it always seems to work.
[01:55:20.572 --> 01:55:21.173]  God comes through.
[01:55:22.679 --> 01:55:30.081]  I told them because they couldn't figure out on the shopping cart how to have an option where you can pay full price if you wanted to, and I just said, create another page with the same shirt under another code number at $19.95.
[01:55:30.241 --> 01:55:31.101]  Have they done that yet?
[01:55:32.621 --> 01:55:37.582]  Because I've been wanting this for months, and some people want to pay full price, and we need to create another page.
[01:55:39.863 --> 01:55:40.183]  Okay?
[01:55:41.263 --> 01:55:42.323]  People say, why are you doing this on air?
[01:55:42.363 --> 01:55:43.243]  I have to direct on air.
[01:55:43.723 --> 01:55:45.104]  I have to work all the time.
[01:55:45.124 --> 01:55:47.724]  I have to actually do management here on air.
[01:55:47.744 --> 01:55:48.144]  It's what I do.
[01:55:48.804 --> 01:55:50.765]  And it's like an office-wide intercom, I guess.
[01:55:51.715 --> 01:55:52.835]  Because I keep asking for that.
[01:55:52.875 --> 01:55:53.476]  Everybody's great.
[01:55:54.016 --> 01:55:54.756]  Nobody's bad.
[01:55:55.496 --> 01:55:57.417]  But I really do need to get the funding.
[01:55:57.477 --> 01:55:59.037]  So we need to add the option for $19.95.
[01:55:59.097 --> 01:56:03.278]  And they keep saying, but the shopping cart won't let us do that.
[01:56:03.478 --> 01:56:05.439]  It's like in Spinal Tap where they go, why does it go to $11?
[01:56:06.459 --> 01:56:07.320]  Because it makes it louder.
[01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:08.840]  And I go, well, just how about make it louder and just says $10?
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:09.860]  And he goes, but it's $11.
[01:56:10.901 --> 01:56:12.021]  What I'm saying...
[01:56:13.407 --> 01:56:34.282]  Just like when I said 15 years ago, we're going to stream live 24 hours a day, and not just have it archived, and it took me a year to convince people to do that, and you heard Drudge say last year it revolutionized, because they then found in the algorithms, people don't want to go hear something that's just canned, they want to jump into something, even if it's not live, it has the feeling of being live.
[01:56:36.118 --> 01:56:46.567]  And I just knew if we're dominating at that time, all these different, you know, shoutcasts and stuff was big then, if we're number one when I'm live, let's just be number one all the time by not ending.
[01:56:47.628 --> 01:56:53.473]  And then we're always at the top, and then we get all these new people that go to that service that was big at the time, and then we get new listeners, and then we defeat the New World Order!
[01:56:54.774 --> 01:57:01.239]  Anyways, I said I'd go to the Assange clip, but it's too epic to play right now.
[01:57:01.259 --> 01:57:02.520]  I'm going to play it coming up.
[01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:03.381]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:57:04.799 --> 01:57:05.640]  We should tweet this out again.
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:06.762]  This is so big.
[01:57:07.303 --> 01:57:09.586]  He doesn't just say she's a demon and gonna put the presses...
[01:57:11.929 --> 01:57:13.689]  Heads and necks in nooses.
[01:57:14.290 --> 01:57:23.671]  He goes over the demographics of how asinine it is to say that Russia is running him, and that Russia is running Trump, and of course Hillary says Russia's running me.
[01:57:23.691 --> 01:57:28.913]  I mean, there have been hundreds of news articles, folks, in the last few years saying, I'm a Kremlin agent.
[01:57:29.533 --> 01:57:34.534]  The only thing Russian around here is Daria doing a fantastic job in there, and she's a veteran of the U.S.
[01:57:34.594 --> 01:57:35.254]  Army and a patriot.
[01:57:35.888 --> 01:57:38.589]  So, let's get some more Russians in here.
[01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:39.030]  I like them.
[01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:41.611]  The point is, is we're not run by the damn Russians, okay?
[01:57:43.031 --> 01:57:44.492]  I'm run by my conscience.
[01:57:45.953 --> 01:57:47.453]  I don't want to splice babies with animals.
[01:57:48.934 --> 01:57:49.935]  I don't want to sell baby parts.
[01:57:51.615 --> 01:57:56.878]  I don't want deadly vaccines they admit on the insert can kill you becoming mandatory as California's now done.
[01:57:57.158 --> 01:57:58.339]  We're in deep crap, people.
[01:57:59.399 --> 01:58:00.960]  And I just try to straight talk everybody.
[01:58:02.534 --> 01:58:04.375]  But you know what, let's have some comedy relief first.
[01:58:05.556 --> 01:58:07.457]  I did take off half a day yesterday.
[01:58:07.497 --> 01:58:08.878]  I did go out with some friends on a boat.
[01:58:09.418 --> 01:58:12.680]  Tim Kennedy and some other folks from the military.
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:18.083]  And Tim caught me actually supporting Hillary Clinton and this is what happened.
[01:58:18.103 --> 01:58:20.024]  So we're going to have some fun.
[01:58:20.044 --> 01:58:20.984]  I like Hillary Clinton.
[01:58:21.605 --> 01:58:22.525]  You know, that's what I support.
[01:58:22.545 --> 01:58:24.726]  So Tim Kennedy, I'm going to support Hillary right now.
[01:58:24.887 --> 01:58:25.287]  No!
[01:58:33.115 --> 01:58:36.838]  It didn't hurt when he did it, except he hit me and his hair slapped me.
[01:58:37.298 --> 01:58:37.878]  Like a whip.
[01:58:37.958 --> 01:58:39.339]  Actually had a mark from his hair hitting.
[01:58:39.379 --> 01:58:40.760]  It was like pow.
[01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:43.182]  But he took me down nicely so I wasn't hurt.
[01:58:43.783 --> 01:58:47.165]  And then there's a whole other story I'm going to tell you later.
[01:58:47.185 --> 01:58:49.426]  He, oh my god, it's ridiculous.
[01:58:53.289 --> 01:58:57.252]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:01.230 --> 01:59:03.072]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:59:03.112 --> 01:59:04.994]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:59:05.134 --> 01:59:07.998]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:59:08.058 --> 01:59:13.904]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:59:14.125 --> 01:59:21.473]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[01:59:21.613 --> 01:59:22.994]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:59:23.295 --> 01:59:28.199]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[01:59:28.379 --> 01:59:30.501]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:59:30.841 --> 01:59:38.548]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:59:38.869 --> 01:59:39.950]  The general public doesn't.
[01:59:41.036 --> 01:59:43.358]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:59:44.979 --> 01:59:48.401]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:59:48.541 --> 01:59:54.985]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:59:55.265 --> 01:59:59.488]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[02:00:03.130 --> 02:00:05.732]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:21.897 --> 02:00:27.025]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:27.586 --> 02:00:29.689]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.709 --> 02:00:32.974]  Yeah, people always ask me, who are you working for?
[02:00:33.735 --> 02:00:35.718]  Who's behind you?
[02:00:35.898 --> 02:00:36.199]  I've had...
[02:00:38.161 --> 02:00:41.264]  Intelligence agency people even from foreign governments that wanted to come visit us.
[02:00:41.524 --> 02:00:43.086]  I was polite and met with them years ago.
[02:00:43.586 --> 02:00:46.569]  I've had our own government come and visit with me and I've met with them.
[02:00:47.169 --> 02:00:55.517]  And I've had, you know, like police chiefs and stuff come in and they're just like, you're not the only guy doing this, are you?
[02:00:55.537 --> 02:00:57.479]  You gotta have something else that's behind this.
[02:00:57.799 --> 02:00:59.321]  No, it's called resistance.
[02:01:00.891 --> 02:01:06.972]  It's called history, it's called will, it's called an incredible audience that aren't just spectators but are in the arena.
[02:01:07.612 --> 02:01:08.252]  The Patriots!
[02:01:09.473 --> 02:01:19.115]  You go to a Trump rally, I remember Race, Color, Creed, go-getters, not a piece of trash on the ground, everybody polite, nice, smart, informed.
[02:01:19.995 --> 02:01:26.236]  You go look at a Hillary event, it looks like the living dead and just
[02:01:28.368 --> 02:01:32.389]  Crazy people protesting and attacking, just all fighting with each other.
[02:01:32.409 --> 02:01:40.692]  It just shows what we're up against is easily defeated if we just decide to take action against it.
[02:01:40.712 --> 02:01:47.794]  There are a lot of folks smarter than I am and I built the info war in 21 years and it's now changing the world because of you.
[02:01:48.614 --> 02:01:50.355]  Now Julian Assange, very powerful
[02:01:52.236 --> 02:01:53.596]  What we are drawing attention to
[02:02:18.018 --> 02:02:36.308]  is the amazing transformation of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party into being the National Security Party and the National Security Candidate by whipping up a Neo-McCarthyist hysteria about Russia.
[02:02:37.949 --> 02:02:44.072]  Any serious analyst understands that China and the United States are the only real games in town.
[02:02:45.162 --> 02:02:49.266]  China has ten times the population of Russia, seven times the GDP.
[02:02:50.386 --> 02:02:52.308]  Russia has the GDP of Italy.
[02:02:53.309 --> 02:02:57.892]  It's interesting in that it wants to be, you know, that it makes provocative statements and so on.
[02:02:57.952 --> 02:03:06.859]  It's interesting and of course within its own neck of the woods, countries between Russia and China, Caucasus and so on,
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:13.791]  Of course, Russia is very significant to them, but on the world stage, Russia is a big player.
[02:03:19.389 --> 02:03:39.146]  That attempted reframing by Hillary Clinton to declare media organizations that are publishing material that shows illicit behavior in the DNC to fix the election for her, as somehow us being Russian agents.
[02:03:39.947 --> 02:03:46.953]  Similar criticism has emerged from people connected to her campaign, To The Intercept, where Glenn Greenwald works.
[02:03:47.922 --> 02:03:58.049]  Her campaign has effectively called, and maybe even directly called, Donald Trump, the opposition leader in this case, a Russian agent.
[02:03:59.250 --> 02:04:07.556]  Jill Stein, the Greens Party candidate, effectively the fourth candidate in terms of numbers, has also been called a Russian agent.
[02:04:08.576 --> 02:04:10.938]  This is a neo-McCarthyist hysteria.
[02:04:11.378 --> 02:04:16.822]  What kind of press environment is this going to lead to post-election?
[02:04:18.751 --> 02:04:35.847]  The American liberal press, in falling over themselves to defend Hillary Clinton, are erecting a demon that is going to put nooses around everyone's necks as soon as she wins this election, which she is almost certainly going to do.
[02:04:38.208 --> 02:04:43.332]  You know, people would ask me if I liked Assange going back eight, nine years ago, and I said, yeah, I see no fault in him.
[02:04:43.372 --> 02:04:46.094]  And they go, oh, he's a, you know, left wing, blah, blah, blah.
[02:04:46.714 --> 02:04:48.916]  And I said, well, we'll see when Democrats get in what he does.
[02:04:50.697 --> 02:04:54.560]  And then if he goes after them when they're bad, he knows he's a hero.
[02:04:55.121 --> 02:04:55.401]  He is.
[02:04:55.421 --> 02:04:55.881]  He's a hero.
[02:04:56.622 --> 02:04:58.663]  And that is pure veritas what you heard.
[02:04:59.384 --> 02:05:00.485]  The press climate.
[02:05:01.687 --> 02:05:03.591]  They are coming after the press like never before.
[02:05:04.012 --> 02:05:08.360]  This is the stuff that dictatorships and authoritarian regimes are made of.
[02:05:08.781 --> 02:05:09.602]  We're in danger.
[02:05:13.314 --> 02:05:16.455]  You said in a speech today you're afraid this election is going to be rigged.
[02:05:16.795 --> 02:05:18.556]  I've been hearing about it for a long time.
[02:05:18.696 --> 02:05:21.497]  I hope the Republicans get out there and watch very closely.
[02:05:21.557 --> 02:05:24.178]  This new poll is showing a big convention bounce for Hillary Clinton.
[02:05:24.278 --> 02:05:28.319]  Following her nomination at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton now leads it.
[02:05:28.619 --> 02:05:30.220]  Donald Trump, 50% to 42%.
[02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:33.341]  That's a 7-point jump from last week.
[02:05:33.461 --> 02:05:35.902]  You see, he's supposed to just sit there and let them steal it.
[02:05:36.082 --> 02:05:38.223]  But he didn't sit there, so they failed.
[02:05:39.286 --> 02:05:46.312]  And they think they're going to have another stolen general election in front of everybody at high noon and we're just going to sit here and go along with it.
[02:05:46.452 --> 02:05:46.852]  We're not.
[02:05:47.853 --> 02:05:48.554]  I'm going to fight it.
[02:05:48.834 --> 02:05:49.655]  Trump's going to fight it.
[02:05:49.935 --> 02:05:50.615]  You're going to fight it.
[02:05:50.796 --> 02:05:52.837]  Bob Mulholland from Chico, California.
[02:05:52.857 --> 02:05:56.040]  I'm a DNC member, thus a superdelegate to the National Convention.
[02:05:56.325 --> 02:05:57.086]  First of all, it's rigged.
[02:05:57.667 --> 02:06:00.170]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[02:06:00.811 --> 02:06:05.697]  And the way we work is that anybody who gets 15% more in an election gets delegates.
[02:06:05.837 --> 02:06:07.840]  So this election will go all the way to California.
[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:11.905]  Sanders will end up with well over a thousand delegates and Hillary will get the nomination.
[02:06:12.145 --> 02:06:20.828]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[02:06:20.928 --> 02:06:21.869]  It has been rigged.
[02:06:22.009 --> 02:06:33.753]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and marginally to
[02:06:34.373 --> 02:06:36.256]  Facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[02:06:36.416 --> 02:06:44.667]  If Hillary steals the nomination, and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[02:06:45.047 --> 02:06:47.891]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[02:06:48.812 --> 02:06:50.334]  Contrary to popular belief.
[02:06:50.675 --> 02:06:52.217]  Then why not holding the primaries?
[02:06:53.206 --> 02:06:54.428]  That's a very good question.
[02:06:54.468 --> 02:06:58.312]  WikiLeaks has dumped nearly 20,000 hacked emails from the DNC.
[02:06:58.352 --> 02:07:05.540]  We're talking about the report of leaked DNC emails showing an effort to undermine Bernie Sanders during the primaries.
[02:07:05.881 --> 02:07:10.246]  The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.
[02:07:10.946 --> 02:07:15.888]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[02:07:15.948 --> 02:07:16.969]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[02:07:17.209 --> 02:07:20.910]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[02:07:21.210 --> 02:07:22.111]  And guess what there is?
[02:07:22.351 --> 02:07:24.252]  She stole the nomination.
[02:07:24.552 --> 02:07:27.293]  I want to thank Bernie Sanders.
[02:07:28.273 --> 02:07:33.095]  If he would have just not done anything, just go home, go to sleep, relax, he would have been a hero.
[02:07:33.275 --> 02:07:34.856]  But he made a deal with the devil.
[02:07:34.876 --> 02:07:35.336]  She's the devil.
[02:07:35.396 --> 02:07:36.977]  He made a deal with the devil.
[02:07:38.579 --> 02:07:44.440]  The media has created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination, and that's the conflict here.
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:46.440]  We feel like we live in a democratic society.
[02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:51.761]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society, and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation.
[02:07:51.861 --> 02:07:54.722]  Crooked Hillary thinks they're gonna pull what they did on Mitt Romney?
[02:07:54.742 --> 02:07:56.262]  Mm, lady, it ain't gonna happen.
[02:07:56.462 --> 02:08:01.583]  That's why her campaign head, her chief strategist said, this is dangerous, what Trump's doing.
[02:08:01.963 --> 02:08:03.363]  You're right, it is dangerous, isn't it?
[02:08:04.003 --> 02:08:05.323]  Actually standing up to you.
[02:08:05.584 --> 02:08:08.164]  There has to come a point at which you say, enough.
[02:08:27.356 --> 02:08:31.277]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:39.578 --> 02:08:41.139]  But I'm here to remind you of who we are.
[02:08:44.439 --> 02:08:46.340]  We're the sons and daughters of abolitionists.
[02:08:52.221 --> 02:08:53.901]  Men and women who gave their lives
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:57.221]  To fight against slavery.
[02:09:02.484 --> 02:09:05.166]  But make no mistake about it, slavery has returned.
[02:09:08.188 --> 02:09:10.169]  And she is more vicious than ever before.
[02:09:11.850 --> 02:09:13.551]  Because this time she is colorblind.
[02:09:13.571 --> 02:09:13.551]  31%.
[02:09:16.993 --> 02:09:18.514]  31% of white Americans
[02:09:25.379 --> 02:09:29.002]  Are welfare recipients.
[02:09:29.022 --> 02:09:41.651]  33% of black Americans have fallen for the same rules and 28% of the Latino community has believed the lie that the government can take care of you from the cradle to the grave.
[02:09:46.614 --> 02:09:48.635]  All the while losing their humanity.
[02:09:50.797 --> 02:09:52.098]  So when Trump talks about
[02:09:55.592 --> 02:09:58.074]  The lies of the Democrat Party has told.
[02:10:00.595 --> 02:10:06.039]  And the failed policies, both in economics, education, and crime.
[02:10:08.841 --> 02:10:15.105]  Your heart should be stirred with passion and strength to do something about it!
[02:10:18.188 --> 02:10:18.768]  That is R.W.
[02:10:19.649 --> 02:10:27.214]  Bray, and out of all the clips from the Austin event that we were obviously there covering, that clip I thought last week was the most powerful.
[02:10:27.594 --> 02:10:28.735]  And his words are true.
[02:10:29.595 --> 02:10:30.236]  They're strong.
[02:10:31.116 --> 02:10:34.419]  But it isn't even the eloquence, it's the force.
[02:10:35.652 --> 02:10:38.293]  Behind it, the way you delivered it was so heartfelt.
[02:10:39.194 --> 02:10:46.157]  Talking to folks that were there, and my reporters, they said that it really, the energy in the room was so strong during that.
[02:10:46.917 --> 02:10:50.499]  And this declaration, basically like Moses saying, we're gonna come out of this thing.
[02:10:50.519 --> 02:10:55.721]  And then I started just thinking back about being in a Republican family growing up, and I never heard anything racist.
[02:10:55.801 --> 02:11:00.424]  In fact, I heard about bad things that people done, how we had to build a free market economy to bring everybody up.
[02:11:01.104 --> 02:11:02.505]  And then I would run into Democrats,
[02:11:03.445 --> 02:11:25.366]  As I grew up and they would be so racist and I was like but the TV says it's the Democrats that are the anti-racist and it's just and it wasn't till I was like even 30 I've been on the air years before I even started even figuring it out because the deception is so total I can't blame some of the Democrats and people that still buy into this because I'm pretty smart guy and I was fooled so I
[02:11:26.127 --> 02:11:28.029]  Now, once you're awake, you're like, what's wrong with these idiots?
[02:11:28.069 --> 02:11:32.774]  But it's just, people don't know history, and those that don't know history, I didn't mean to repeat it, R.W.
[02:11:32.814 --> 02:11:41.802]  Bray, I'm not going to go over his amazing military career and all the things he's done, and he's the engagement director of the Republican Party of Texas.
[02:11:42.663 --> 02:11:43.384]  I'm not going to go over it all.
[02:11:43.744 --> 02:11:46.767]  rwbray.com, texasgop.org.
[02:11:46.787 --> 02:11:47.908]  And let's be clear, I just want to be clear.
[02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:49.890]  I'm not lionizing the Republican Party.
[02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:52.312]  It's done a lot of horrible stuff and it's certainly been involved.
[02:11:52.352 --> 02:11:53.533]  But that's different people.
[02:11:53.634 --> 02:11:56.636]  But the point is, it's not the party that they've been saying it is.
[02:11:56.676 --> 02:11:57.938]  Now, I've invited you here and I'm ranting.
[02:11:57.958 --> 02:11:58.718]  You drove here from Houston.
[02:11:59.159 --> 02:12:00.840]  I want to get into this with you and I want to give you the floor.
[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:05.204]  The reason I'm so honored you said you'd come in to see us, so just on the phone, is because I want to...
[02:12:06.018 --> 02:12:15.425]  You know, give folks not just five minutes of your speech, but people to really let you take over if you want, and kind of give us a sermon on your life, your development, what took you to this point.
[02:12:15.825 --> 02:12:21.489]  Because I think all of us are going through this process, but how do we accelerate that in others that haven't?
[02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:22.350]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:12:22.710 --> 02:12:24.131]  No, thank you for having me.
[02:12:24.211 --> 02:12:24.972]  Really appreciate you coming in.
[02:12:25.626 --> 02:12:26.126]  So take over.
[02:12:27.227 --> 02:12:29.849]  First let me tell you that my wife adores you.
[02:12:30.290 --> 02:12:32.912]  She's a new fan ever since you all reached out.
[02:12:32.932 --> 02:12:33.912]  She had never really saw it.
[02:12:33.952 --> 02:12:38.756]  She started reaching out looking more at your clips and she thinks that you're phenomenal.
[02:12:38.896 --> 02:12:40.777]  Well, I'm humble.
[02:12:40.817 --> 02:12:41.098]  Thank you.
[02:12:41.138 --> 02:12:41.458]  Thank you.
[02:12:42.719 --> 02:12:43.079]  I don't know.
[02:12:43.099 --> 02:12:45.621]  I think the story kind of is very simple.
[02:12:45.961 --> 02:12:47.923]  The speech actually was from my heart.
[02:12:48.804 --> 02:12:56.171]  I think that's the only way to be able to express from a black lens the importance of us adopting republicanism.
[02:12:56.471 --> 02:13:01.056]  And for me, I'm actually a, I'm from Louisiana originally.
[02:13:01.076 --> 02:13:06.501]  I consider myself a person who, I evacuated from Katrina.
[02:13:07.422 --> 02:13:11.145]  I was in a guard at the time, so after evacuating I had to run back actually.
[02:13:11.165 --> 02:13:12.566]  I was called up to serve.
[02:13:13.766 --> 02:13:21.892]  I was given the order to find 10 families in Houston who had evacuated with me and bring them back.
[02:13:22.572 --> 02:13:23.873]  Even though I was in Baton Rouge.
[02:13:23.953 --> 02:13:37.199]  So I actually had to drive to Houston, find 10 families, bring them back to Baton Rouge, and then take the mothers and the husbands who were actually guard members to serve.
[02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:41.621]  So I did a month in search and rescue and three months of ICU.
[02:13:42.282 --> 02:13:43.742]  And that's where my conversion starts.
[02:13:44.183 --> 02:13:47.064]  Unfortunately, I didn't have the benefit of being raised in a Republican family.
[02:13:47.464 --> 02:13:48.445]  I was raised a Democrat.
[02:13:49.318 --> 02:13:56.706]  See, I didn't know your story, but I think for all of us, it's humanizing it, how you get to the point of this powerful speech that goes worldwide and wakes up so many people.
[02:13:56.766 --> 02:13:58.688]  I just knew it would be very interesting.
[02:13:58.969 --> 02:13:59.209]  Yes.
[02:13:59.830 --> 02:14:03.974]  It's a story in and of itself, but I'll give you a fast version of it.
[02:14:05.315 --> 02:14:11.537]  I was taking a Blackhawk trip, and as I was taking the Blackhawk trip, we were actually looking for movement.
[02:14:11.557 --> 02:14:12.198]  That was our goal.
[02:14:12.218 --> 02:14:13.478]  We had to look for it in life.
[02:14:14.478 --> 02:14:17.339]  It was devastating, and just devastation upon devastation.
[02:14:17.359 --> 02:14:23.461]  I remember looking at the east side of New Orleans, and it was all gray, Alex.
[02:14:23.862 --> 02:14:24.542]  Everything was gray.
[02:14:25.262 --> 02:14:28.745]  So we gave up looking for life, and so we circled back around.
[02:14:28.765 --> 02:14:29.666]  By gray you mean gray water.
[02:14:30.006 --> 02:14:31.748]  Just gray water, gray houses, you know.
[02:14:31.768 --> 02:14:32.909]  Yeah, no heat and the flare.
[02:14:33.089 --> 02:14:33.450]  Nothing.
[02:14:33.890 --> 02:14:34.691]  Nothing was going on.
[02:14:34.891 --> 02:14:42.057]  And so we got to the riverwalk, and I saw the pilot starting to cry.
[02:14:42.077 --> 02:14:46.602]  And I looked down, and it's nothing but men and women who looked just like me.
[02:14:47.455 --> 02:14:49.696]  And that's when I knew we had believed a lie.
[02:14:50.396 --> 02:14:51.817]  The government cannot take care of you.
[02:14:52.317 --> 02:14:58.139]  It was droves of African-Americans with their hands up, in America, looking for someone to be dropped down.
[02:14:58.219 --> 02:14:59.160]  I don't know the story, but let me guess.
[02:14:59.180 --> 02:14:59.920]  What color was the pilot?
[02:15:00.860 --> 02:15:01.060]  White.
[02:15:02.941 --> 02:15:05.242]  And my whole point is, is that we're just all human beings.
[02:15:05.262 --> 02:15:05.682]  That's right.
[02:15:05.702 --> 02:15:13.285]  And the way they play on this, and then even when the military goes out, you know, Obama said a few weeks ago about Louisiana again.
[02:15:13.305 --> 02:15:14.606]  He said, be sure, don't be racist.
[02:15:16.499 --> 02:15:17.340]  Teams that are going in there?
[02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:24.447]  I have family that was there as well, who was active duty army, but they actually brought them in on that with the helicopters, and they were there working 18 hours a day.
[02:15:24.467 --> 02:15:24.708]  Oh yeah.
[02:15:25.168 --> 02:15:26.429]  I had family get really hurt there.
[02:15:26.850 --> 02:15:32.376]  And I tell you, it really pisses them off when they care about everybody, and they're being told they're racist even as they're saving people.
[02:15:33.797 --> 02:15:38.280]  What I get from that is, I don't want to put words in your mouth, are you saying that was another big moment for you to see that?
[02:15:38.621 --> 02:15:40.042]  Yes, that was a shocking moment for me.
[02:15:40.702 --> 02:15:49.028]  And the amazing thing is that we circled back around to the east side later on that day because we had to only, you had to do footwork as well as air.
[02:15:49.488 --> 02:15:59.656]  So we went through the homes, you know, making the marks on the walls and whatnot, and in the rubbish of a house I found a book called Up From Slavery by Booker T. Washington.
[02:16:00.478 --> 02:16:09.321]  And so I took that book, washed it off, and I had a small little tent where our area was, and at night I would read that book.
[02:16:10.262 --> 02:16:11.802]  And it changed my life.
[02:16:11.922 --> 02:16:15.144]  Booker T. Washington was an entrepreneur.
[02:16:16.084 --> 02:16:18.585]  He was an education advocate.
[02:16:18.925 --> 02:16:20.986]  He started his own university.
[02:16:21.026 --> 02:16:23.947]  It would be no Tuskegee Airmen if it wasn't for this guy.
[02:16:23.967 --> 02:16:25.888]  It would be no Tuskegee University if it wasn't for this guy.
[02:16:26.548 --> 02:16:32.476]  But I saw his story, um, literally from, he went from dirt floors to marble.
[02:16:33.238 --> 02:16:37.023]  Um, and he gave one of the most powerful speeches, the Atlantic Compromise I'd ever heard in my life.
[02:16:37.343 --> 02:16:43.051]  And by the way, I mean, I know this history of folks that don't, and I'm not defending segregation, it was horrible, but it was, we replaced one evil with another.
[02:16:43.832 --> 02:17:06.586]  It was his model and system that made black communities in many areas wealthier in the white areas, which created the institutional racism even more, and they started pushing massive class warfare between poor whites and poor blacks, and that's when LBJ and all them came in with, we're gonna get the men out of the house, we're gonna break these communities down, because blacks just said, okay, you're gonna suppress us, we're gonna create our own community.
[02:17:06.626 --> 02:17:07.186]  That's right.
[02:17:07.286 --> 02:17:08.647]  And so they got rid of it.
[02:17:08.707 --> 02:17:11.889]  See, I didn't even know this, you knew all this, almost no one knows this, I'm trying to explain to people.
[02:17:12.249 --> 02:17:13.250]  Wow, that's amazing!
[02:17:13.410 --> 02:17:13.990]  Yeah.
[02:17:14.071 --> 02:17:19.094]  So if Americans, period, would do what Booker T. Washington did, we'll explain it to people then.
[02:17:19.534 --> 02:17:22.256]  Yeah, so Booker T. Washington, like I said, advocated for education.
[02:17:23.037 --> 02:17:29.201]  He could not get the, what I would have called racist whites, to invest at all into his... But you did it yourself!
[02:17:29.482 --> 02:17:36.066]  He did it himself, and he went out and he got investors, Republican investors, which is exactly what I'm advocating now.
[02:17:36.086 --> 02:17:42.211]  I don't like for us to go around making excuses, but... Even the racist, the Republican party that founded the KKK?
[02:17:44.420 --> 02:17:45.161]  Oh, it's the Democrats.
[02:17:45.181 --> 02:17:45.641]  I'm sorry.
[02:17:45.661 --> 02:17:46.221]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:17:46.261 --> 02:17:46.922]  I forgot about that.
[02:17:46.942 --> 02:17:47.842]  Those are the Democrats.
[02:17:48.503 --> 02:17:49.904]  And it's amazing.
[02:17:50.344 --> 02:17:52.885]  I love the fact that you're knowledgeable of this history.
[02:17:53.066 --> 02:17:58.089]  And I tried to give a brief history at the Trump rally.
[02:17:58.209 --> 02:18:01.631]  Well, my family in Texas, on my dad's side, were Republicans and went through a lot of crap over it.
[02:18:02.332 --> 02:18:04.293]  In fact, I never told the stories on air because it's over the top.
[02:18:04.333 --> 02:18:07.415]  But you imagine East Texas being Republicans in the 40s and 50s and 60s.
[02:18:07.495 --> 02:18:09.836]  It was not a very... I can only imagine.
[02:18:10.317 --> 02:18:11.417]  But I'm a racist.
[02:18:13.755 --> 02:18:15.376]  Yeah, while you're having me on the show.
[02:18:15.456 --> 02:18:15.777]  Exactly.
[02:18:15.897 --> 02:18:18.338]  No, but I mean, it just shows how those that don't know history don't need to repeat it.
[02:18:18.358 --> 02:18:19.579]  The public period doesn't know history.
[02:18:19.759 --> 02:18:19.859]  No.
[02:18:19.879 --> 02:18:21.521]  Please continue with your story.
[02:18:21.801 --> 02:18:22.882]  And that was my conversion.
[02:18:23.002 --> 02:18:30.327]  Between that experience, Katrina, obviously, and the book, seeing a black man who had no... It was unapologetic for being a Republican.
[02:18:30.447 --> 02:18:31.347]  Changed my entire life.
[02:18:31.508 --> 02:18:34.129]  My whole view of how I needed to advance my life.
[02:18:34.550 --> 02:18:36.811]  It was then I realized that I needed to start getting active.
[02:18:37.312 --> 02:18:40.414]  And ushers in why I'm now an advocate for the Republican Party of Texas.
[02:18:40.474 --> 02:18:41.314]  I'm a proud advocate.
[02:18:42.255 --> 02:18:42.836]  I would not have...
[02:18:43.616 --> 02:18:48.799]  Well that's what Trump does, whether it's myself or you, he gives a voice to other people that have important information
[02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:12.934]  And then he's helping magnify a whole new group of people.
[02:19:12.994 --> 02:19:13.354]  That's right.
[02:19:13.374 --> 02:19:15.777]  To truly create real diversity of ideas and thought.
[02:19:15.817 --> 02:19:16.077]  That's right.
[02:19:16.097 --> 02:19:17.959]  And really not have teleprompters, but come together.
[02:19:18.159 --> 02:19:18.400]  That's right.
[02:19:18.420 --> 02:19:18.920]  And just get real.
[02:19:18.940 --> 02:19:20.282]  Because our country's in trouble.
[02:19:20.522 --> 02:19:22.484]  Oh yeah, and you have the energy of John Brown.
[02:19:23.525 --> 02:19:29.291]  I love it because, I'm not sure if your listeners know who John Brown is, but John Brown was good friends with Frederick Douglass.
[02:19:29.891 --> 02:19:37.674]  Um, there's a powerful abolitionist, powerful advocate, um, who wanted to basically end slavery at all costs to the point he got militia to do it.
[02:19:37.934 --> 02:19:39.735]  He was going to overtake the entire government.
[02:19:39.755 --> 02:19:40.015]  Yeah.
[02:19:40.255 --> 02:19:44.716]  But he wanted to, white, white racists wound up hanging this guy for even, you know, even trying to do this.
[02:19:44.776 --> 02:19:49.278]  But I think, I'll play the guy, they never hang you, but I think the fire that you have
[02:19:49.958 --> 02:19:52.340]  It's reminiscent of those days and I think that's what's coming.
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:54.702]  I think there's going to be a second reconstruction.
[02:19:55.082 --> 02:20:01.286]  And I think it's going to happen through people who get galvanized and ignite a fire underneath their bellies to start doing something.
[02:20:01.727 --> 02:20:03.648]  Yeah, the Democrats are playing total race card.
[02:20:03.668 --> 02:20:05.349]  You want to write back to their KKK roots.
[02:20:05.450 --> 02:20:06.690]  I mean, I'm not just demonizing them.
[02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:07.251]  They deserve it.
[02:20:07.271 --> 02:20:08.632]  I mean, Julian Assange is a real liberal.
[02:20:09.032 --> 02:20:10.673]  He says Hillary Clinton is a demon.
[02:20:11.974 --> 02:20:17.999]  Before the Clintons left their governorship in Arkansas, more than 100 people had been suspiciously
[02:20:19.637 --> 02:20:25.281]  Hundreds more died during their first terms and the scourge continues to this day.
[02:20:26.341 --> 02:20:35.948]  DNC staffer after DNC staffer that speaks out against election fraud or leaks information to WikiLeaks ends up gunned down.
[02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:41.328]  And the Clinton crime family and their backers is now in the spotlight.
[02:20:42.570 --> 02:20:46.898]  If I die, if they kill me, it was done for a worthy cause.
[02:20:47.779 --> 02:20:49.723]  Somebody's gotta stand up against these people.
[02:20:50.834 --> 02:21:02.281]  Long before George W. Bush had taken office, or Senator Obama was even thinking about being president, I was there, exposing the crimes of the Clintons.
[02:21:03.182 --> 02:21:10.406]  So it is fitting that I, Alex Jones, called the Dark Heart by Hillary Clinton, would be your chronicler.
[02:21:11.326 --> 02:21:16.767]  A chronicler who risked his very life exposing these evil ones.
[02:21:17.107 --> 02:21:20.188]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[02:21:20.208 --> 02:21:23.489]  Just a few days ago, Hillary Clinton, one of the most powerful criminal kingpins in history,
[02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:41.609]  Came out on national television and said that I had a horrible dark heart.
[02:21:42.119 --> 02:21:48.721]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[02:21:49.202 --> 02:21:55.904]  I thought back to the history of the Clinton's reign of criminal terror in the last 20 plus years on this planet.
[02:21:56.684 --> 02:22:07.128]  And I have to tell you, it's surreal to realize that Alex Jones, little old me, is one of the main opposition points against these monsters.
[02:22:08.506 --> 02:22:18.254]  Once they were in the White House, they expanded the bombing to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of attacks a year on the infrastructure of Iraq.
[02:22:18.734 --> 02:22:31.824]  They got the UN to pass the most draconian sanctions ever in modern history, where medicine and food and all forms of technology were basically blocked from coming into the country.
[02:22:32.824 --> 02:22:37.008]  Over a million and a half Iraqis starved to death and died.
[02:22:38.124 --> 02:22:52.696]  And Hillary Clinton's mentor, Madeleine Albright, bragged on 16 Minutes and other channels that 500,000 dead Iraqi children were a good price to pay of the sanctions.
[02:22:53.737 --> 02:22:56.138]  We have heard that half a million children have died.
[02:22:57.039 --> 02:23:01.343]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[02:23:02.443 --> 02:23:05.406]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[02:23:06.443 --> 02:23:11.125]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[02:23:11.645 --> 02:23:21.528]  But when you are a Machiavellian sociopath, or a sadistic psychopath, you don't look at things about alliances and who's right and who's wrong.
[02:23:22.048 --> 02:23:32.532]  You look at a billion plus Muslims, and you look at Syria, and you look at the invasion points where you can come into all of Europe and take over.
[02:23:33.752 --> 02:23:36.055]  But first you've got to get the weapons to invade.
[02:23:36.956 --> 02:23:37.777]  And you see Libya.
[02:23:38.337 --> 02:23:40.240]  And Muammar Gaddafi was set up.
[02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:45.386]  Jihadists out of Saudi Arabia via the State Department and Hillary were brought into Benghazi.
[02:23:45.446 --> 02:23:46.427]  They attacked the country.
[02:23:46.828 --> 02:23:50.011]  The West had a bombing campaign to back the takeover.
[02:23:50.412 --> 02:23:51.994]  Islamists were put in control.
[02:23:52.634 --> 02:23:53.195]  Christians
[02:23:54.349 --> 02:24:03.599]  Blacks, non-radical Muslims, Shiites and others were killed by the tens of thousands and Hillary formed, by design, a failed state.
[02:24:03.980 --> 02:24:07.023]  We came, we saw, he died.
[02:24:17.693 --> 02:24:20.014]  R.W.
[02:24:20.054 --> 02:24:24.234]  Bray from Louisiana.
[02:24:24.354 --> 02:24:27.735]  I'm from right here in Texas.
[02:24:27.795 --> 02:24:30.616]  I'm from a family in East Texas, which is basically Louisiana.
[02:24:31.056 --> 02:24:35.176]  And we were talking earlier about wild stuff that we even told people.
[02:24:35.216 --> 02:24:36.997]  They wouldn't believe it unless you've lived in the South.
[02:24:38.497 --> 02:24:42.318]  About the Democratic Party and just if all the stupid liberals knew what we knew.
[02:24:44.318 --> 02:24:45.299]  This is only a six minute segment.
[02:24:45.339 --> 02:24:46.460]  Long segment coming up.
[02:24:46.481 --> 02:24:48.022]  We'll give out the number and take calls.
[02:24:48.323 --> 02:24:54.950]  Let's get into those brush fires you've been setting with the Trump campaign and preach if you want.
[02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:55.311]  Take over.
[02:24:55.571 --> 02:24:55.831]  Yes.
[02:24:58.054 --> 02:24:59.135]  We've been tearing them up, Alex.
[02:25:00.035 --> 02:25:05.499]  We spent a lot of time in Texas dispelling the myths and lifting the veil.
[02:25:05.599 --> 02:25:11.923]  One of the things that we've done is, you know, Republican parties kind of tried to take an approach where they would do outreach.
[02:25:11.963 --> 02:25:12.684]  We changed that.
[02:25:13.024 --> 02:25:15.946]  We changed the language of outreach to engagement.
[02:25:16.266 --> 02:25:24.511]  And we figured the Democrat Party is going to integrate themselves into our communities, then the Republican Party is going to integrate themselves back into the black community.
[02:25:24.831 --> 02:25:25.952]  And that's exactly what we did.
[02:25:25.972 --> 02:25:37.119]  So we teamed up and collaborated with different organizations, from Black Chamber of Commerce's, who are pushing entrepreneurial programs, to IP, which is a faith-based program.
[02:25:37.139 --> 02:25:42.803]  It's all about taking underprivileged men and women in the 3 to 4 and the 5th wards of Houston, which is predominantly black,
[02:25:43.243 --> 02:25:53.730]  And lifting them up, giving them jobs, economically independent, hooking them up with their civic presidents to become civically involved, and teaching them the importance of integrity and standing up as men so they don't return back to the prisons.
[02:25:54.150 --> 02:26:00.435]  So we're actually, in the communities that we once were trying to preach from afar, we're out in the streets preaching.
[02:26:00.455 --> 02:26:06.199]  And I think it's changing the rhetoric and the language of what people think a Republican is.
[02:26:06.239 --> 02:26:09.401]  And so we actively are rebranding Republicanism.
[02:26:10.365 --> 02:26:20.195]  Is it right to say that the black community, after eight years of neglect from Obama, unemployment rate almost doubling for black Americans, that they're ready for the wake-up call?
[02:26:20.215 --> 02:26:21.296]  Because that's what we see in the streets.
[02:26:21.617 --> 02:26:28.164]  But then I see the news, you know, spinning it, that African Americans don't like Trump, but the numbers even show that record numbers do.
[02:26:28.686 --> 02:26:29.446]  You're absolutely right.
[02:26:29.506 --> 02:26:31.847]  I cannot tell you how many phone calls I've received since that speech.
[02:26:32.288 --> 02:26:41.832]  People have found my number somehow, and they are emailing, they are texting, they are calling me on Facebook, sending messages, and most of these individuals are blacks.
[02:26:42.312 --> 02:26:44.513]  And these are African Americans who are sick of the system.
[02:26:44.893 --> 02:26:49.156]  You have so many...gay is not the new black, number one.
[02:26:49.476 --> 02:26:51.437]  And that's something that I get across a lot.
[02:26:51.517 --> 02:26:57.581]  They'll say, hey, we don't have anything against the lesbian community or the gay community, but we don't think it's the same plight.
[02:26:57.641 --> 02:26:58.642]  So what do we need to do?
[02:26:59.843 --> 02:27:01.944]  You're in the party that is not going to preach that.
[02:27:02.324 --> 02:27:07.328]  BLM just received over a hundred, I think it was a hundred million from Ford.
[02:27:07.928 --> 02:27:12.612]  And so they're going to try and push $100 million to press Black Lives Matter.
[02:27:13.172 --> 02:27:16.915]  And one of the things on there are initiatives that have nothing to do with black lives.
[02:27:17.355 --> 02:27:24.701]  Black lives has nothing to do with... It's creating victimology with a string so they can make everybody dance.
[02:27:24.741 --> 02:27:28.103]  They're puppet strings where you're a victim, we're the people you trust.
[02:27:28.524 --> 02:27:29.885]  By the way, we're going to double your unemployment.
[02:27:30.285 --> 02:27:31.426]  Oh yeah, at the same time.
[02:27:52.404 --> 02:28:02.054]  It made people innovate where so many of the famous inventions were created by people with no education that were African because they absolutely had to to survive.
[02:28:02.074 --> 02:28:02.495]  That's right.
[02:28:02.535 --> 02:28:05.258]  And then you see, quote, government free handouts creating devastation.
[02:28:05.638 --> 02:28:06.039]  That's right.
[02:28:06.119 --> 02:28:08.161]  And liberals have a way of seriously doing that.
[02:28:08.221 --> 02:28:08.922]  I mean, you think about it.
[02:28:09.162 --> 02:28:13.807]  The top the top Democrat states in America are led by white liberals.
[02:28:14.127 --> 02:28:19.274]  There's only, if you take the top 12 states that typically vote blue, there's only one black democrat.
[02:28:19.614 --> 02:28:24.200]  So basically, yeah we want you to 94% vote, but you can't lead our party.
[02:28:24.620 --> 02:28:29.306]  The DNC, 94% of African Americans are voting black, but the DNC is a white liberal.
[02:28:29.983 --> 02:28:32.947]  And so that's just like the plantation mindset.
[02:28:32.967 --> 02:28:35.650]  They know how to set the crops up to harvest later.
[02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:40.876]  And for them, the blacks are the slaves that offer them the votes they need in order to stay in office.
[02:28:40.956 --> 02:28:43.259]  Well, I'll say this, because they're going to screw over the Hispanics as well.
[02:28:43.279 --> 02:28:45.842]  They want cheap labor and a permanent underclass.
[02:28:46.383 --> 02:28:48.725]  But right now, they're going, oh my God, blacks are waking up.
[02:28:49.346 --> 02:28:53.848]  We better switch over to Hispanics, and that's why you've seen such a total abandonment.
[02:28:54.008 --> 02:28:54.449]  That's right.
[02:28:54.709 --> 02:29:00.211]  And the sad thing is that African Americans in those areas don't see the importance and the power of their vote.
[02:29:00.592 --> 02:29:03.273]  No one party should have a monopoly over the black vote.
[02:29:03.633 --> 02:29:05.394]  People want it, they need to earn it.
[02:29:05.514 --> 02:29:09.716]  And the African Americans have given their vote over to Democrats and they've lost their power.
[02:29:09.736 --> 02:29:10.536]  Let's talk about Trump.
[02:29:10.556 --> 02:29:11.297]  We're going to break in a minute.
[02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:16.554]  So, uh, what's your, like, in-person meeting, what's your impression?
[02:29:17.355 --> 02:29:17.955]  He's just like you.
[02:29:18.996 --> 02:29:19.277]  Truly.
[02:29:19.677 --> 02:29:22.520]  He's the guy who says weird things and gives it to you straight, no chaser.
[02:29:22.900 --> 02:29:24.321]  You gotta appreciate being a man like that.
[02:29:24.702 --> 02:29:29.546]  Doesn't matter, you know, we've gone to this PC world, where you just can't say anything that's really on your mind.
[02:29:29.986 --> 02:29:33.129]  Well, that's not, that's not, that's not the way you do things moving.
[02:29:33.430 --> 02:29:33.710]  That's right.
[02:29:35.391 --> 02:29:41.874]  We want to get rid of this establishment and Congress has a 9% approval rating and the media has a 6% and then here's the whole thing we hate.
[02:29:42.434 --> 02:29:47.656]  The whole system that we say we don't want is having conniption fits over Donald Trump.
[02:29:48.096 --> 02:29:50.837]  People are insane if they don't.
[02:29:51.158 --> 02:29:53.639]  It's like he said, what do you have to lose?
[02:29:54.119 --> 02:29:54.959]  You're getting screwed over.
[02:29:54.979 --> 02:29:56.940]  I'm gonna make better deals.
[02:29:57.060 --> 02:29:57.660]  Guaranteed.
[02:29:57.680 --> 02:29:58.681]  It's guaranteed.
[02:29:58.781 --> 02:29:59.301]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:59.949 --> 02:30:02.916]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.936 --> 02:30:06.545]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.169 --> 02:30:17.334]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:30:17.715 --> 02:30:20.597]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:30:20.957 --> 02:30:26.142]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:30:26.562 --> 02:30:32.527]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:30:32.687 --> 02:30:35.810]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:37.411]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:30:37.611 --> 02:30:41.755]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:30:41.935 --> 02:30:44.818]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:30:44.898 --> 02:30:46.459]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:30:46.559 --> 02:30:49.742]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:30:50.022 --> 02:30:52.345]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:30:52.625 --> 02:30:53.586]  It's in powder form.
[02:30:53.686 --> 02:30:56.388]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:30:56.568 --> 02:30:57.569]  I take this.
[02:30:57.689 --> 02:30:58.971]  This is the product that I take.
[02:30:59.091 --> 02:31:01.052]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:31:01.873 --> 02:31:02.654]  We fight the Globals.
[02:31:02.674 --> 02:31:03.535]  We fight the New World Order.
[02:31:03.815 --> 02:31:10.120]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:11.181 --> 02:31:12.182]  Brain Force is here.
[02:31:12.723 --> 02:31:14.985]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:31:15.265 --> 02:31:23.092]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:31:23.857 --> 02:31:26.999]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:27.440]  Right?
[02:31:27.460 --> 02:31:29.802]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:31:30.162 --> 02:31:33.685]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:31:33.725 --> 02:31:36.867]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:31:37.367 --> 02:31:42.151]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:31:42.712 --> 02:31:44.533]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:31:44.893 --> 02:31:49.337]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:31:49.477 --> 02:31:51.498]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:31:52.099 --> 02:31:53.580]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:31:53.720 --> 02:31:53.960]  Exactly.
[02:31:53.980 --> 02:31:57.783]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:31:58.283 --> 02:32:05.548]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:05.828 --> 02:32:06.268]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:11.525 --> 02:32:19.109]  Once again, Donald Trump has stepped into the vacuum left by Hillary and Obama as he quickly accepted an offer from the Mexican President to meet.
[02:32:19.370 --> 02:32:28.535]  He not only met with the Mexican President, but he took control of the press conference afterwards, infuriating Trump's media opponents like Spanish-language channel anchor Jorge Ramos.
[02:32:28.895 --> 02:32:41.959]  Ramos inadvertently praised the leadership of Trump when he unleashed a string of tirades on Twitter in both English and Spanish, excoriating the Mexican president for looking passive, even for agreeing with Trump that NAFTA could be improved.
[02:32:42.239 --> 02:32:49.841]  Meanwhile, Hillary hasn't held a press conference for 272 days, since the beginning of December, before any primaries.
[02:32:50.101 --> 02:32:52.602]  And we're now over 80% of the way through the election.
[02:32:52.782 --> 02:32:59.446]  Hillary could only carp from the sidelines, as she did when Trump visited flood victims of Louisiana, while she ignored them completely.
[02:32:59.686 --> 02:33:06.231]  Don't expect Hillary to talk to the Mexican president before the election, because it would be followed by a press conference, and she can't handle that.
[02:33:06.511 --> 02:33:08.412]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:33:21.297 --> 02:33:24.199]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.219 --> 02:33:28.762]  R. W. Bray.
[02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:41.580]  R-W-B-R-A-Y dot com.
[02:33:42.181 --> 02:33:44.201]  Just R-W-B-R-A-Y dot com.
[02:33:44.721 --> 02:33:45.701]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:33:46.001 --> 02:33:47.362]  Again, I'm not going to belabor this.
[02:33:47.942 --> 02:34:02.326]  If you want to support the broadcast, support local affiliates, become a sponsor, love those local stations, spread the word, paintinfowars.com on the side of your barn, put up a billboard, buy the products, great nutraceuticals like selenium that we just came out with.
[02:34:02.426 --> 02:34:04.926]  It's from the mustard seed, the best bioavailable form out there.
[02:34:05.406 --> 02:34:07.427]  It's using all electrochemical activity in the body.
[02:34:08.047 --> 02:34:10.428]  To get all the toxins out of the cells, you name it, you die without it.
[02:34:11.428 --> 02:34:18.869]  People are massively, massively, I'm gonna take something right now, massively not getting enough selenium out there.
[02:34:18.909 --> 02:34:21.410]  Do your own research, look into what selenium does.
[02:34:23.250 --> 02:34:26.031]  Cancer rates, you name it, it is truly a game changer.
[02:34:26.071 --> 02:34:29.992]  And it fuses with iodine, but nobody's got the proper type of iodine.
[02:34:30.012 --> 02:34:33.352]  We have the only true nascent iodine from our research that's out there.
[02:34:34.372 --> 02:34:36.773]  It's from a deep earth source, not from seaweed.
[02:34:38.404 --> 02:34:42.846]  The stuff we have would eat through three layers of steel building like in the movie Alien.
[02:34:43.726 --> 02:34:59.653]  I mean, that's how powerful the good halogen is, but then through a special patented Russian technique, I guess we are now Russian agents, I guess that's a Russian connection, the media's got it, it is then injected into organic palm oil and then is no longer stuff that'll eat through steel girders.
[02:35:00.433 --> 02:35:03.475]  And I'm just documenting for you how powerful this halogen is.
[02:35:04.315 --> 02:35:10.036]  It's in the same family as fluoride, chlorine, all the garbage that just inundates our environment.
[02:35:10.176 --> 02:35:16.437]  And you take selenium, you take this, you take enough vitamin C. We don't sell that because there's so many good sources of it out there naturally.
[02:35:17.097 --> 02:35:18.418]  They all work in synergy.
[02:35:18.438 --> 02:35:20.178]  But if you don't have one of these, you die.
[02:35:20.198 --> 02:35:23.959]  And deficiencies in it are just record level.
[02:35:24.819 --> 02:35:25.639]  Record level.
[02:35:25.959 --> 02:35:29.380]  Your cells don't have this, they start malfunctioning, they start mutating.
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:30.660]  There's a name for that.
[02:35:31.641 --> 02:35:41.267]  Infowarslives.com, Infowarsstore.com, or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:35:41.287 --> 02:35:49.032]  And we also have Hillary for Prison shirts at cost, because I just want to see... 100,000 of these are already out there.
[02:35:49.392 --> 02:35:50.532]  It's already sending shockwaves.
[02:35:50.572 --> 02:35:51.733]  It's all over the news constantly.
[02:35:51.753 --> 02:35:54.775]  It's one of the most searched terms this year on the internet.
[02:35:55.696 --> 02:35:56.856]  And we started it.
[02:35:56.956 --> 02:35:57.497]  You started it.
[02:35:57.597 --> 02:35:58.337]  You bought the shirts.
[02:35:58.377 --> 02:35:59.038]  You got them out there.
[02:35:59.078 --> 02:35:59.718]  You did the work.
[02:36:00.398 --> 02:36:01.059]  I had the idea.
[02:36:02.276 --> 02:36:03.857]  It all goes together like a horse and carriage.
[02:36:04.637 --> 02:36:06.218]  And we have the Support the Infowar.
[02:36:06.658 --> 02:36:12.562]  You can click and get it for $19.95 at full price if you want, where we make $10 to fund things, or $9.95 shipping included.
[02:36:12.582 --> 02:36:15.103]  $5 for the shirt, $5 to ship it on average.
[02:36:15.643 --> 02:36:17.304]  So, choose.
[02:36:17.324 --> 02:36:21.426]  $19.95 if you want to help us, or, doesn't matter, you're helping us getting it at $9.95.
[02:36:21.686 --> 02:36:22.547]  We're all helping each other.
[02:36:22.907 --> 02:36:26.469]  InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLife.com is Nutraceuticals.
[02:36:27.169 --> 02:36:29.571]  20% off our great Vitamin Mineral Fusion Fruit Punch.
[02:36:30.311 --> 02:36:37.536]  From our research, again, this is the, because I always say that, because there might be something better out there, and if there is, we're going to go out and probably label it.
[02:36:38.217 --> 02:36:45.502]  This is the best game-changing multivitamin mineral system for full absorption, or the highest level of absorption for you and your family.
[02:36:45.522 --> 02:36:50.786]  Just like our medical bottle in Secret 12 is nutraceutical grade, pharmacy grade, vitamin B12.
[02:36:50.826 --> 02:36:52.007]  It's the same stuff people inject.
[02:36:52.307 --> 02:36:53.068]  Don't inject this.
[02:36:53.348 --> 02:36:54.329]  It's for under the tongue.
[02:36:54.569 --> 02:36:57.231]  You want to inject it, it's even more absorbable, go get it from a doctor.
[02:36:58.571 --> 02:37:02.013]  But minus that, and let me tell you, injectable from a doctor is like way up here.
[02:37:02.713 --> 02:37:05.654]  Our stuff's down here, but everything else is way down here.
[02:37:05.714 --> 02:37:08.615]  I mean, you don't absorb basically any of the synthetic trash that's out there.
[02:37:08.955 --> 02:37:12.756]  Put it under your tongue, hold it for a minute, and you're gonna get closer to an injection.
[02:37:13.277 --> 02:37:13.837]  Not as good!
[02:37:14.909 --> 02:37:17.170]  I'll be honest with you, but it is a game-changer.
[02:37:17.490 --> 02:37:23.752]  I sit around with top scientists, developers, chemists, and I say, what are game-changers missing links?
[02:37:24.052 --> 02:37:31.054]  There's a ton of them, because most nutraceutical companies will put $10 into marketing, $2 into what's in it, and then sell it for $100.
[02:37:31.194 --> 02:37:31.874]  We don't do that.
[02:37:32.274 --> 02:37:32.695]  We have 100% markup.
[02:37:34.315 --> 02:37:34.735]  On average.
[02:37:35.016 --> 02:37:37.357]  The average is seven times the markup.
[02:37:37.997 --> 02:37:50.465]  No, I'm going to put quality in the bottle, do 100% markup, fund our operation, have all the big health sites go crazy over what we're doing, dominate the market, and have all these people buying our products that aren't even listeners now.
[02:37:50.485 --> 02:37:53.727]  In fact, we're getting a lot of listeners from people getting the products because they're that good.
[02:37:54.147 --> 02:37:59.651]  I went out and found the top three developers of nutraceuticals in the country, and I did deals with all three of them.
[02:38:00.868 --> 02:38:01.789]  The group's just one of them.
[02:38:02.269 --> 02:38:05.351]  The others are too scared to come on air from big companies, even bigger than group.
[02:38:05.732 --> 02:38:09.134]  I mean, some of these companies are supplying like a third of the stuff at Whole Foods, just so you know.
[02:38:09.675 --> 02:38:11.396]  And so that's why our stuff is so good.
[02:38:11.616 --> 02:38:15.459]  And plus, it's got to be bulletproof with the government coming after us, how they harass supplement makers.
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:17.761]  I want it to be great quality for everybody.
[02:38:18.482 --> 02:38:19.342]  I want you to come back.
[02:38:19.402 --> 02:38:20.303]  I want you to get a good deal.
[02:38:21.004 --> 02:38:22.785]  I want to be treated like I treat other people.
[02:38:25.327 --> 02:38:26.188]  It's like revolutionary.
[02:38:26.428 --> 02:38:27.649]  No, that's what built America, folks.
[02:38:27.969 --> 02:38:30.311]  All I'm doing is just like he did, going back and reading history books.
[02:38:31.391 --> 02:38:31.551]  I don't
[02:38:47.213 --> 02:38:48.474]  And again, I'm not pushing oppression.
[02:38:49.155 --> 02:38:51.316]  The point is, open oppression makes you stronger.
[02:38:52.017 --> 02:38:52.817]  You should smash it.
[02:38:53.338 --> 02:38:57.361]  But what we're being killed by is all this largesse, how easy everything's gotten, and the not being aware.
[02:38:57.621 --> 02:38:58.642]  Now, I want to take phone calls.
[02:38:58.662 --> 02:38:58.702]  800-259-9231.
[02:38:58.722 --> 02:38:59.022]  800-259-9231.
[02:38:59.042 --> 02:38:59.222]  RWBRAVE.
[02:39:05.387 --> 02:39:06.288]  R.W.Bray.com.
[02:39:06.668 --> 02:39:10.230]  He is the Black Engagement Director of the Republican Party of Texas.
[02:39:10.850 --> 02:39:14.292]  He's a military veteran and a patriot and we appreciate him being.
[02:39:14.352 --> 02:39:20.035]  He's currently a Master Sergeant serving as First Sergeant Guardsman and proud Veterans Advocate in Houston, Texas.
[02:39:21.089 --> 02:39:22.951]  And a lot of other community stuff for children, you name it.
[02:39:23.511 --> 02:39:25.493]  MLK Association, Vice Chair of Texas.
[02:39:25.773 --> 02:39:26.654]  I'm going to stop right there.
[02:39:26.874 --> 02:39:27.455]  That's another thing.
[02:39:27.475 --> 02:39:29.076]  MLK, a Republican.
[02:39:29.116 --> 02:39:30.317]  It goes on and on.
[02:39:30.357 --> 02:39:31.558]  But give us your greatest hits.
[02:39:31.698 --> 02:39:40.126]  I mean, what's really powerful, what folks need to know, sir, and what Trump needs to do to win, what we need to do to win.
[02:39:41.371 --> 02:39:51.440]  Strategically, I think Trump needs to make sure that he has advocates and surrogates in North Carolina, Wisconsin, PA, Michigan.
[02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:54.322]  Reason why is because, number one, that's the Rust Belt.
[02:39:54.562 --> 02:40:00.608]  Number two, places like Ohio, we have a significant black population who are waiting for an answer.
[02:40:01.629 --> 02:40:03.891]  Their neighborhoods are being torn apart.
[02:40:04.511 --> 02:40:13.733]  By bitter rivalries, whether that's through gangs, or whether that's just the simple fact that people are living in poverty, are fed up, and they are overreacting and reacting by killing their own.
[02:40:14.213 --> 02:40:16.013]  That is a consequence of the Democrat lead.
[02:40:16.033 --> 02:40:18.154]  Think about this, Alex.
[02:40:18.174 --> 02:40:21.334]  50 council members in Chicago, 49 of which are Democrat.
[02:40:22.855 --> 02:40:23.515]  One Republican.
[02:40:24.315 --> 02:40:31.416]  And you look across the nation, wherever there's Democrats in lead, in leadership, there is a failing municipality.
[02:40:31.776 --> 02:40:33.577]  And that's because there are some ideologies that work.
[02:40:35.257 --> 02:40:35.777]  I would agree.
[02:40:35.797 --> 02:40:36.098]  Sorry.
[02:40:36.478 --> 02:40:39.459]  I agree, but there are some ideologies that work, and there are some that don't.
[02:40:39.819 --> 02:40:43.201]  The thing about Republican ideologies is that they are timeless, traditional.
[02:40:43.501 --> 02:40:46.083]  They've always worked, they always will, provided we remember.
[02:40:46.123 --> 02:40:51.445]  And the fact of the matter of fact is that humans often have a bad habit of losing memory.
[02:40:52.066 --> 02:40:52.386]  I agree.
[02:40:52.426 --> 02:40:53.987]  Those that don't know history, don't repeat it.
[02:40:54.007 --> 02:40:54.567]  Please continue.
[02:40:54.887 --> 02:40:55.067]  Yeah.
[02:40:55.527 --> 02:41:01.491]  Well, one of the ways that we're jabbing at this thing, and I gotta say this, I really love your Hillary shirt.
[02:41:02.351 --> 02:41:05.133]  I have a good friend of mine, Carl Maniola, came into the Trump battle with me.
[02:41:05.153 --> 02:41:07.234]  We almost got kicked out because they didn't read the thing.
[02:41:07.715 --> 02:41:11.597]  But when they finally read it... No, it's a great conversation starter, exactly.
[02:41:11.617 --> 02:41:12.557]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:41:12.578 --> 02:41:14.258]  They finally read it and it allowed them to come in.
[02:41:14.319 --> 02:41:16.120]  But I think that
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:20.162]  Agitating the current status quo.
[02:41:21.123 --> 02:41:22.544]  Like, yes sir, it agitates people.
[02:41:22.784 --> 02:41:25.545]  We need to continue to agitate people verbally, though, and that's the problem.
[02:41:25.726 --> 02:41:29.988]  There aren't enough black surrogates, and Trump wants to make a dent.
[02:41:30.348 --> 02:41:30.909]  Well, exactly.
[02:41:30.929 --> 02:41:35.051]  In fact, that shows how sophisticated you are, because I barely even realized it when I did it.
[02:41:35.091 --> 02:41:37.633]  I just always have the idea, and then I see the thinking behind it later.
[02:41:37.653 --> 02:41:38.554]  It's like my brain just knows.
[02:41:39.054 --> 02:41:40.935]  I wanted it to cause debates.
[02:41:41.035 --> 02:41:41.355]  That's right.
[02:41:41.375 --> 02:41:42.396]  And cause discussions.
[02:41:42.776 --> 02:41:43.056]  That's right.
[02:41:43.076 --> 02:41:44.277]  And say, Hillary for prison.
[02:41:44.597 --> 02:41:45.338]  That's our campaign.
[02:41:45.558 --> 02:41:45.798]  Yes.
[02:41:45.898 --> 02:41:47.739]  And then it's really caught on, but please continue.
[02:41:47.839 --> 02:41:49.279]  Well, that's what Frederick Douglass stood for.
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:53.381]  Frederick Douglass, the very first father of the Civil Rights Movement, stood for three things.
[02:41:53.821 --> 02:41:57.103]  He stood for economic independence.
[02:41:57.223 --> 02:42:00.464]  Number two, social and business collaboration.
[02:42:00.804 --> 02:42:04.385]  And number three... Let's put Frederick Douglass on screen.
[02:42:04.666 --> 02:42:07.567]  That guy, he'd be a movie star today, and that guy just looks so cool.
[02:42:08.447 --> 02:42:08.687]  Yes.
[02:42:09.067 --> 02:42:11.988]  And number three, his last one was agitation.
[02:42:12.728 --> 02:42:13.228]  Agitation.
[02:42:13.548 --> 02:42:21.550]  One of the last things that he said in his last speech, a young black man at a university asked him, as a young black man, what should I be doing?
[02:42:21.610 --> 02:42:24.250]  He says, agitate, agitate, agitate.
[02:42:24.750 --> 02:42:30.552]  And what I see in Infowars, what I see in people like Trump and yourself and others that I've come across the nation is that we are ready.
[02:42:30.692 --> 02:42:32.312]  Political agitation has moved the needle.
[02:42:32.452 --> 02:42:35.375]  Yeah, what you're saying is, we're not trying to play in the corrupt system.
[02:42:35.415 --> 02:42:36.156]  We're changing it.
[02:42:36.417 --> 02:42:38.779]  We're not trying to play by their rules and go along with it.
[02:42:39.020 --> 02:42:41.583]  We're expanding the entire paradigm.
[02:42:41.703 --> 02:42:42.123]  That's right.
[02:42:42.203 --> 02:42:43.625]  And what better place to start than Texas?
[02:42:44.066 --> 02:42:45.848]  The RPT is doing powerful things.
[02:42:45.868 --> 02:42:47.610]  We're going to areas that no other state is going.
[02:42:47.910 --> 02:42:49.612]  We're getting calls that no other state is calling.
[02:42:50.053 --> 02:42:51.074]  And when you think about that,
[02:42:51.294 --> 02:42:53.194]  They rewrote Ron Paul's district over and over again.
[02:42:53.534 --> 02:42:59.176]  They kept rewriting it for Democrats in black areas, thinking, and then he won by even bigger landslides.
[02:42:59.216 --> 02:42:59.716]  That's right.
[02:42:59.736 --> 02:43:00.156]  That's right.
[02:43:00.436 --> 02:43:08.978]  Because people go meet him, he's just a sweet, loving doctor that had been like, you know, volunteering three days a week for decades at poor hospitals.
[02:43:09.038 --> 02:43:09.398]  That's right.
[02:43:09.438 --> 02:43:14.259]  And this is a guy who literally, like, would volunteer two, three days a week at poor hospitals.
[02:43:14.279 --> 02:43:14.639]  That's right.
[02:43:14.659 --> 02:43:16.099]  Because he, for no money.
[02:43:16.119 --> 02:43:16.519]  That's right.
[02:43:16.539 --> 02:43:17.220]  Because he believed in it.
[02:43:17.900 --> 02:43:19.160]  And of course, he's racist Ron Paul, though.
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:23.463]  Well, most people believe that common sense isn't common these days, but the truth is that it is.
[02:43:23.963 --> 02:43:25.304]  People know common sense when they see it.
[02:43:25.585 --> 02:43:31.669]  They see earnestness, they see a man with the correct heart, they see a person who has passion, and they will gravitate toward it.
[02:43:32.049 --> 02:43:41.036]  If Trump continues to make sure that he goes into these black neighborhoods, regardless of whatever the media is saying, continue to go, because I'm in those black neighborhoods.
[02:43:41.056 --> 02:43:41.476]  He's been doing it.
[02:43:41.757 --> 02:43:42.597]  Yeah, and they like it.
[02:43:42.897 --> 02:43:46.540]  They like the fact that finally someone is coming into those neighborhoods and talking.
[02:43:46.900 --> 02:43:47.801]  And that's how we're going to win.
[02:43:47.821 --> 02:43:48.682]  Meanwhile, Obama
[02:43:51.114 --> 02:43:56.920]  Vacations like a hundred days a year and doesn't even care about Louisiana and gets away with it.
[02:43:56.940 --> 02:43:57.801]  I mean, I'm not defending Bush.
[02:43:57.821 --> 02:43:58.841]  He had some problems big time.
[02:43:59.202 --> 02:44:01.224]  But he, okay, some problems with Katrina response.
[02:44:01.244 --> 02:44:02.024]  At least he responded.
[02:44:02.485 --> 02:44:03.426]  They don't even show up!
[02:44:03.686 --> 02:44:04.547]  Hillary doesn't even care!
[02:44:04.607 --> 02:44:10.292]  It's like... I had a show on Lifting the Veil until the liberals got mad.
[02:44:10.753 --> 02:44:13.275]  It was in Houston and they killed this show.
[02:44:13.635 --> 02:44:15.537]  It was called Lifting the Veil off of Booker T. Washington.
[02:44:15.557 --> 02:44:15.977]  It was amazing.
[02:44:16.017 --> 02:44:16.438]  On local radio?
[02:44:16.918 --> 02:44:18.438]  Oh yeah, they kill shows!
[02:44:19.038 --> 02:44:20.059]  We get knocked off all the time.
[02:44:20.079 --> 02:44:22.499]  They'll come and say, $300,000, take him off.
[02:44:22.779 --> 02:44:24.139]  Yeah, they're good at it.
[02:44:24.319 --> 02:44:37.122]  But one thing that really touched home was that if Obama really cared for African Americans, or the current administration period, we had one opportunity to get a Supreme Court judge and a Latino was appointed.
[02:44:37.162 --> 02:44:39.782]  We had another one and an LGBT was appointed.
[02:44:39.922 --> 02:44:42.723]  Even his third choice that he tried to come was not a black person.
[02:44:43.283 --> 02:44:48.008]  So, a lot of people in the black neighborhoods are starting to see that this guy never was going to make our lives better.
[02:44:48.028 --> 02:44:51.052]  And the truth is that you can't depend on the government to make your life better.
[02:44:51.532 --> 02:44:52.574]  Only you can do that.
[02:44:52.654 --> 02:44:55.897]  Plus, to use the analogy, I mean, it's being pimped.
[02:44:55.997 --> 02:44:56.798]  I already got you.
[02:44:56.878 --> 02:44:57.379]  I don't need you.
[02:44:57.419 --> 02:44:58.100]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:44:58.240 --> 02:44:58.560]  I mean, hey!
[02:44:59.582 --> 02:44:59.902]  Boom!
[02:45:00.482 --> 02:45:01.203]  It's a given.
[02:45:01.223 --> 02:45:04.164]  It's about time that we start listening to our ancestors.
[02:45:05.405 --> 02:45:06.966]  X talked about not trusting liberals.
[02:45:07.146 --> 02:45:12.289]  One of the greatest quotes he ever said was, keep in mind that a Dixiecrat is nothing more than a Democrat in disguise.
[02:45:12.929 --> 02:45:17.891]  He talked about the fact that one party we had been invested in has abandoned us.
[02:45:17.991 --> 02:45:20.313]  It was racist from the beginning and it will always be racist.
[02:45:20.573 --> 02:45:25.135]  MLK warned us of not judging men by his color and not his content.
[02:45:25.155 --> 02:45:28.717]  You got blacks who won't join the Republican Party simply because there's a lot of white people in it.
[02:45:28.797 --> 02:45:38.125]  And let's explain, it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy where they say the Tea Party's racist and so then minorities, or majorities in Australia, don't go.
[02:45:38.145 --> 02:45:44.290]  And what the real racism is the media pushing that, but then what's happening on the Trump phenomenon, I want you to speak to this because it's documented.
[02:45:45.529 --> 02:45:53.715]  Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, others are going, and they're absolutely being appreciated by everybody, and they're like, wow, this is incredible, and people are coming together, it's very cathartic.
[02:45:53.935 --> 02:45:54.936]  I see people crying.
[02:45:54.956 --> 02:45:55.436]  That's right.
[02:45:55.536 --> 02:45:56.417]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:45:56.737 --> 02:45:59.999]  So again, they create the perception, which makes it the reality.
[02:46:00.399 --> 02:46:02.661]  Oh yeah, we have modern-day abolitionists right now.
[02:46:03.021 --> 02:46:09.666]  People who, brave people of different colors, going to those neighborhoods, saying, come with me to this, come with me to see Hillary's America.
[02:46:09.986 --> 02:46:12.308]  Come with me to watch this, and they're learning.
[02:46:12.348 --> 02:46:17.673]  There was a black woman who was at the Trump rally who was brought by two white friends, and she was right up front.
[02:46:17.993 --> 02:46:18.894]  I thought that was amazing.
[02:46:18.914 --> 02:46:23.819]  So there are modern-day abolitionists, but more importantly, I believe, this is the rebirth of a second Reconstruction.
[02:46:24.279 --> 02:46:24.519]  W.E.B.
[02:46:24.539 --> 02:46:29.624]  Du Bois even said that he wished that the Reconstruction had finished its mark.
[02:46:29.944 --> 02:46:31.486]  It never finished what it was supposed to do.
[02:46:32.026 --> 02:46:33.467]  Now it has an opportunity to do that.
[02:46:33.527 --> 02:46:37.248]  Republicans need to wake up and know... Well, they got hijacked by a lot of corruption when Lincoln got killed.
[02:46:37.308 --> 02:46:38.089]  Well, obviously, yeah.
[02:46:38.109 --> 02:46:40.490]  You cut off the head of the snake, right?
[02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:40.890]  Yeah.
[02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:49.013]  All I know is, I don't know how Trump gets blamed for being on the KKK, when 20 years ago and 10 years ago, by himself, he decried David Duke.
[02:46:50.094 --> 02:46:54.515]  And then, meanwhile, Hillary's, like, kissing all over Robert Byrd, you know, the KKK wizard.
[02:46:55.196 --> 02:46:56.696]  I mean, it's just, you can't make this up.
[02:46:56.796 --> 02:46:57.337]  I mean, it's just...
[02:46:58.277 --> 02:47:04.500]  No, and I think another thing, just to add something to it, the black community has finally woke up to Margaret Sanger and her lies.
[02:47:05.020 --> 02:47:09.482]  You know, we have a population that is declining in the black neighborhood.
[02:47:09.742 --> 02:47:15.204]  When you consider 120 years ago, black population made up 30, we're at 12 to 13 percent now.
[02:47:15.504 --> 02:47:16.545]  So over a century and a half,
[02:47:17.205 --> 02:47:17.805]  We only make up 13%.
[02:47:18.145 --> 02:47:19.106]  Oh, I know.
[02:47:19.146 --> 02:47:25.388]  That's the fundamental where I'm told you're racist because you don't want Black Lives Matter and George Soros trying to turn black people into racists.
[02:47:25.748 --> 02:47:26.149]  Show that.
[02:47:26.169 --> 02:47:27.829]  In fact, there was a big study out last week.
[02:47:27.849 --> 02:47:28.430]  I meant to cover it.
[02:47:28.450 --> 02:47:29.130]  I didn't get into it.
[02:47:29.210 --> 02:47:30.110]  Major university study.
[02:47:30.150 --> 02:47:30.851]  Can you guys pull it up?
[02:47:31.211 --> 02:47:35.773]  Diversity programs actually make things less diverse and hurt minority communities.
[02:47:35.893 --> 02:47:36.393]  Absolutely.
[02:47:36.473 --> 02:47:36.673]  Yes.
[02:47:36.713 --> 02:47:38.934]  You turn Hispanics and black people into basically
[02:47:39.514 --> 02:47:47.499]  KKK versions for minority groups, hopping up and down, truly real progressive business owners, I don't care what color they are, don't want trouble.
[02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:49.561]  And they're just, all of a sudden, they're not racist.
[02:47:49.581 --> 02:47:50.261]  They're scared.
[02:47:50.962 --> 02:47:52.102]  And people look like chips.
[02:47:52.163 --> 02:47:59.207]  I mean, the worst thing about spoiled kids, and we've all got them, you know, nowadays in this society, is that they always think there's a chip on their shoulder and you did something to them.
[02:47:59.407 --> 02:48:01.929]  And that's part of maturity, is getting past having a chip on your shoulder.
[02:48:02.329 --> 02:48:09.134]  And they're just trying to install chips on people's shoulders, like it's a degree or something, when all it is is an anchor around your neck.
[02:48:10.735 --> 02:48:17.859]  Speaking of anchors, the anchor institutions, black anchor institutions like NAACP are now fighting against charter schools and academies.
[02:48:18.799 --> 02:48:21.041]  P. Diddy actually just created a charter school in New York.
[02:48:21.341 --> 02:48:23.382]  The NAACP is going to be trying to fight to kill it.
[02:48:24.022 --> 02:48:24.783]  Nationwide.
[02:48:25.123 --> 02:48:26.043]  It is now mandated.
[02:48:26.183 --> 02:48:26.964]  And good for P. Diddy!
[02:48:27.324 --> 02:48:27.825]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:48:27.865 --> 02:48:29.707]  I'm going to help people that want to get out of this hell.
[02:48:29.747 --> 02:48:30.267]  Exactly.
[02:48:30.688 --> 02:48:31.108]  Exactly.
[02:48:31.308 --> 02:48:41.919]  And if they don't know how to teach our children, then why not get a retired superintendent, retired teachers in the area, and create a charter school and teach those kids in a way that the liberal whites are failing.
[02:48:42.079 --> 02:48:42.880]  Why is that bad?
[02:48:43.241 --> 02:48:44.442]  The truth is that the Democratic Party
[02:48:45.823 --> 02:48:50.745]  The Democrat Party wants to corral African Americans and minorities into one area so they can control them.
[02:48:51.065 --> 02:48:51.545]  Absolutely.
[02:48:51.565 --> 02:48:55.786]  I want to go to Tony and Carl and Mike and Alex and David and others.
[02:48:55.806 --> 02:48:59.488]  We've only got five minutes in the next segment and then five minutes more before the next hour starts.
[02:48:59.888 --> 02:49:01.928]  Who do we have taking over today in the fourth hour?
[02:49:01.948 --> 02:49:04.029]  David Knight will always be doing a great job.
[02:49:04.409 --> 02:49:05.109]  So much to cover.
[02:49:05.129 --> 02:49:08.831]  They're launching massive censorship initiatives that Drudge is covering.
[02:49:08.851 --> 02:49:09.631]  Drudge4.com.
[02:49:10.451 --> 02:49:12.532]  YouTube's New Terms of Service says if you're a
[02:49:13.092 --> 02:49:15.834]  You know, as an extremist, we're going to take your monetization away.
[02:49:16.154 --> 02:49:18.855]  That is, that's economic gulags, okay?
[02:49:18.875 --> 02:49:22.897]  That is, that's what Hitler and the ghettos, I mean, this is a major move.
[02:49:23.197 --> 02:49:29.121]  It's the Chinese social credit model, and Drudge is covering all that, Paul Watson's article.
[02:49:30.046 --> 02:49:31.487]  But let's take a phone call before we go to break.
[02:49:31.907 --> 02:49:33.108]  In fact, I just can't help it.
[02:49:33.168 --> 02:49:35.369]  I'm going to skip this network break, even though it costs us like $5,000.
[02:49:35.469 --> 02:49:38.350]  I'm doing it because I need to just have more time here.
[02:49:39.111 --> 02:49:40.071]  So callers realize that.
[02:49:40.791 --> 02:49:43.593]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tony.
[02:49:43.613 --> 02:49:45.134]  He says he's an NBC whistleblower.
[02:49:45.154 --> 02:49:54.859]  I was calling for whistleblowers a few days ago, and some called in to talk about the atmosphere with this unified press environment, which Assange is just like, this is like totalitarianism.
[02:49:54.879 --> 02:49:56.819]  This is the unified BS.
[02:49:56.860 --> 02:49:58.520]  Really shameful, quite frankly, and frightening.
[02:49:58.981 --> 02:49:59.521]  Tony, go ahead.
[02:50:00.919 --> 02:50:01.499]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[02:50:01.519 --> 02:50:02.580]  It's been a long listener.
[02:50:02.860 --> 02:50:05.361]  It's about 2009.
[02:50:06.922 --> 02:50:10.784]  And, you know, back since 9-11, I started to realize that something wasn't right.
[02:50:11.645 --> 02:50:22.471]  So, I've seen the documentary, what was it called, Blue Change, and I started to see things, and as I worked in the news, you know, I just felt like a lot of these stories weren't given both sides.
[02:50:22.591 --> 02:50:26.833]  So, as I became producer on a weekend newscast, and the anchor,
[02:50:28.035 --> 02:50:32.558]  You know, I started adding little bits to the story and giving my sources and then we had high ratings.
[02:50:32.638 --> 02:50:35.260]  I mean, it was incredible to the point where they didn't know why.
[02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:41.183]  So the viewers started emailing in and then they were like, you know, he's got this information.
[02:50:41.203 --> 02:50:50.529]  So I get called into the office and they say, Hey, uh, you need to stop putting this stuff into the stories because, uh, you know, it's not approved by NBC.
[02:50:50.549 --> 02:50:54.752]  And I'm like, well, it's, you know, we have to share both sides of this story.
[02:50:54.792 --> 02:50:56.573]  So I think it's good journalism.
[02:50:56.613 --> 02:50:57.534]  Isn't that what we studied?
[02:50:58.271 --> 02:50:59.032]  They're like, no, no, no, no.
[02:50:59.072 --> 02:51:00.094]  It's coming from NBC.
[02:51:00.114 --> 02:51:01.296]  You just put it in the way it is.
[02:51:01.937 --> 02:51:02.518]  Don't change it.
[02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:04.441]  And I said, okay.
[02:51:04.522 --> 02:51:06.785]  I said, uh, but you know, we're going to lose ratings.
[02:51:06.846 --> 02:51:07.807]  I mean, you need to look at that.
[02:51:07.827 --> 02:51:09.270]  I mean, people love this information.
[02:51:09.971 --> 02:51:11.634]  Look, you're just being told don't do it.
[02:51:12.901 --> 02:51:13.242]  All right.
[02:51:13.422 --> 02:51:14.023]  Absolutely.
[02:51:14.143 --> 02:51:14.483]  Absolutely.
[02:51:14.503 --> 02:51:25.039]  I mean, I want to hear the rest of your story, but for folks that don't know, local so-called news, and I want to change this while we're watching a TV system, I've been so busy fighting other fights, I haven't quite got that launch yet, but it's happening, folks.
[02:51:25.059 --> 02:51:27.643]  And always, you know, good times seems to be in God's plan.
[02:51:29.185 --> 02:51:30.726]  Everybody should just put out their own news.
[02:51:30.806 --> 02:51:32.667]  It's inexpensive now to do it compared to what it was.
[02:51:32.967 --> 02:51:40.311]  So that stations, UHF, VHF, cable have a choice and don't just spew because it comes down in talking points.
[02:51:40.631 --> 02:51:41.872]  They load the teleprompter.
[02:51:42.172 --> 02:51:45.194]  It looks like your local trusted news person is more trusted than national.
[02:51:46.089 --> 02:51:52.054]  Let's say 50% trusted local versus 6% national, but really your local person is really a national repeater.
[02:51:52.414 --> 02:51:57.118]  And so you're witnessing people want both sides or three or four sides.
[02:51:57.558 --> 02:51:58.158]  They want it.
[02:51:58.258 --> 02:52:06.665]  It makes your ratings go up, but the media is still willing to kill itself to be able to maintain the political control because they're not in the business of making money at the news level.
[02:52:06.925 --> 02:52:12.269]  They're in the business of making money for the larger global agenda and massive trillion dollar banker bailouts.
[02:52:12.309 --> 02:52:13.730]  But finish the rest of the story.
[02:52:13.750 --> 02:52:14.251]  I apologize.
[02:52:15.421 --> 02:52:15.841]  That's okay.
[02:52:15.941 --> 02:52:23.244]  Uh, no, and then, you know, the funny thing is, is I heard one of your other callers yesterday talking about, you know, you're trying to bring stories to the newsroom.
[02:52:23.844 --> 02:52:26.385]  You know, people just, you know, they look at you like you're crazy.
[02:52:26.425 --> 02:52:28.046]  Like, you know, you're one of those nuts.
[02:52:28.766 --> 02:52:32.027]  And I said, no, I said, look, here's information, here's documentation.
[02:52:32.468 --> 02:52:33.608]  This is important stuff.
[02:52:33.928 --> 02:52:38.070]  So they're like, and you get labeled, but then you're kind of labeled in the newsroom.
[02:52:38.110 --> 02:52:39.210]  You're kind of an outcast.
[02:52:39.870 --> 02:52:41.091]  So they thought the best way to,
[02:52:41.741 --> 02:52:45.625]  You know, help me not put out the message, was to put me on a morning show and make it fun.
[02:52:45.665 --> 02:52:47.467]  Yeah, he's got a good personality, you know.
[02:52:47.527 --> 02:52:48.568]  Sir, that's a handbook.
[02:52:48.608 --> 02:52:54.654]  When they walked in at Shamrock Communications, I had the number one show in talk radio, period, in Austin, after three years on air.
[02:52:55.014 --> 02:52:56.135]  I'm 25 years old.
[02:52:56.636 --> 02:52:57.737]  I'm making them tons of money.
[02:52:58.298 --> 02:53:00.260]  And they said, you're going to do an entertainment show now.
[02:53:02.048 --> 02:53:03.549]  In the morning, or we're going to fire you.
[02:53:03.769 --> 02:53:04.730]  And I said, I can't stop it.
[02:53:04.750 --> 02:53:06.231]  Six weeks later, they fired me with pleasure.
[02:53:06.731 --> 02:53:08.732]  And they said, because you're talking bad about Bill Clinton.
[02:53:09.193 --> 02:53:11.094]  Now, I'd already started my other shows, so it didn't matter.
[02:53:11.514 --> 02:53:14.716]  But I have experience where you're going to do entertainment now, buddy.
[02:53:14.816 --> 02:53:15.857]  Do you understand?
[02:53:16.257 --> 02:53:17.278]  Or next, you're fired.
[02:53:17.318 --> 02:53:17.898]  Please continue.
[02:53:19.299 --> 02:53:23.562]  So then, it was right around the time the NDAA was signed.
[02:53:23.682 --> 02:53:26.324]  And it was in the newscast, which I didn't produce.
[02:53:26.344 --> 02:53:30.727]  You know, I could only add the promos and the teases.
[02:53:31.798 --> 02:53:37.121]  And then, uh, you know, I figured, well, since I can't really put it in the script, well, here's an opportunity.
[02:53:37.141 --> 02:53:38.041]  We're going to go to a two-shot.
[02:53:38.842 --> 02:53:43.024]  So I go to the two-shot and say, hey, you know, um, a lot of folks don't really know what that stands for.
[02:53:43.824 --> 02:53:45.065]  What those acronyms mean.
[02:53:45.105 --> 02:53:46.706]  And then I explained a little bit about it.
[02:53:47.706 --> 02:53:52.549]  And then she just kind of looked at me, my co-anchor, and just, I don't know, you're getting information.
[02:53:52.589 --> 02:53:53.569]  I'm like, well, it's out there.
[02:53:54.110 --> 02:53:54.850]  Here's a copy of it.
[02:53:54.870 --> 02:53:55.670]  That's how brainwashed.
[02:53:55.690 --> 02:53:58.232]  They don't even want you to say National Defense Authorization Act.
[02:53:58.936 --> 02:54:01.358]  Like, having info is now like evil.
[02:54:01.718 --> 02:54:02.459]  Oh, he's informed!
[02:54:02.499 --> 02:54:04.060]  You're not allowed to!
[02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:06.582]  NBC from New York sends it and we just say it!
[02:54:06.802 --> 02:54:08.063]  He's talking on his own!
[02:54:08.563 --> 02:54:09.484]  We can't have that!
[02:54:10.104 --> 02:54:11.365]  See, it's programming, folks.
[02:54:11.686 --> 02:54:13.547]  Teleprompters down to us.
[02:54:13.747 --> 02:54:14.147]  That's right.
[02:54:14.428 --> 02:54:18.130]  And when Trump, you know, is forced to use one because it's his actual speech, that's fine.
[02:54:18.290 --> 02:54:20.852]  But when he's attacking it, he's saying, look, it's script written.
[02:54:21.052 --> 02:54:22.393]  It's coming down to them.
[02:54:23.354 --> 02:54:25.376]  So, so, so, let me guess, what happened next?
[02:54:27.233 --> 02:54:32.517]  Well, you know, I just, uh, I was no longer in the circle and I was kind of an outcast.
[02:54:33.598 --> 02:54:36.100]  And, uh, I could just feel the pressure from beneath me.
[02:54:36.180 --> 02:54:42.565]  Cause when you make your way to that position, there's everybody on the bottom, just gunning it just to put you out or to get you off.
[02:54:43.906 --> 02:54:46.768]  So, uh, no longer invited to the parties and, um,
[02:54:47.310 --> 02:54:49.352]  You know, I'd leave the newsroom and I'd come back.
[02:54:49.372 --> 02:54:51.734]  First they ostracize, then they dehumanize you.
[02:54:51.754 --> 02:54:53.475]  Because they don't want to actually fire their friend.
[02:54:53.495 --> 02:54:54.636]  They have to learn to hate you first.
[02:54:54.916 --> 02:54:56.217]  Because they're cowards, number one.
[02:54:57.118 --> 02:54:57.978]  So how did it end?
[02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:05.284]  Well, it was about just, you know, a couple of months into my second year, they decided to let me go.
[02:55:05.304 --> 02:55:08.547]  I was kind of having some health issues, so I went to the doctor.
[02:55:09.307 --> 02:55:10.869]  And, you know, I was passed out.
[02:55:10.949 --> 02:55:12.590]  So they were giving me checks and everything.
[02:55:12.730 --> 02:55:13.811]  They said, look, don't go to work.
[02:55:14.679 --> 02:55:16.801]  And they figured, well, maybe the morning show isn't for you.
[02:55:16.861 --> 02:55:17.521]  It's too early.
[02:55:17.541 --> 02:55:21.845]  So I presented that to my bosses and they delayed me coming back.
[02:55:21.905 --> 02:55:24.347]  And then before you know it, I get a letter saying I'm gone.
[02:55:25.548 --> 02:55:28.991]  And, uh, you know, there's like 30 reasons why you could be let go.
[02:55:29.812 --> 02:55:34.275]  Like if you're a kid and you're suspended from school, you're suspended because you bit or you spit on somebody.
[02:55:35.056 --> 02:55:40.621]  But in this case, it was a general term for like, uh, just general, you know, misconduct.
[02:55:41.235 --> 02:55:41.495]  Got it.
[02:55:41.855 --> 02:55:44.056]  Well listen, brother, I gotta jump, but thank you for your testimony.
[02:55:44.076 --> 02:55:45.376]  We want to get more of those testimonies.
[02:55:45.836 --> 02:55:46.636]  God bless you, Tony.
[02:55:46.736 --> 02:55:48.177]  Because that's what goes on behind the scenes.
[02:55:48.777 --> 02:55:55.038]  We have news reporters on about this, and they're just like, yeah, we all get in the room, and they go, we're gonna lie about Trump, just make stuff up, everybody go get him.
[02:55:55.058 --> 02:55:58.039]  I mean, they don't even... Assange is a real liberal.
[02:55:58.539 --> 02:55:59.359]  A really person I respect.
[02:55:59.379 --> 02:56:02.760]  He's actually is a liberal, not a KKK person masquerading as a liberal.
[02:56:04.315 --> 02:56:06.536]  He's like, this press climate, we're all in danger.
[02:56:06.576 --> 02:56:07.696]  Hillary is a monster.
[02:56:07.816 --> 02:56:12.638]  I mean, it's like, why is it so shameful to see this level of control?
[02:56:13.278 --> 02:56:15.039]  And they're only destroying themselves in the process.
[02:56:15.339 --> 02:56:19.620]  Yeah, and the foundation is an example of how corruption just breeds more corruption.
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:24.081]  You would think you're the third most important person in America and you still want to be more corrupt.
[02:56:24.322 --> 02:56:25.462]  You have no reason to be corrupt.
[02:56:25.842 --> 02:56:38.000]  But there's so much more out there to that and I think as far as the black population and minorities period, I think they see that and I think that they don't want to vote for a crook and they'll probably vote for Donald Trump.
[02:56:38.717 --> 02:56:44.043]  Well sure, and a lot of polls he's way ahead, but those are the scientific polls, the big fake ones they put out, where they add 15% more.
[02:56:44.263 --> 02:56:45.084]  Come on.
[02:56:45.124 --> 02:56:50.089]  Reuters admits they add 15% more Democrats to the poll, and then Hillary's winning by 15 points.
[02:56:50.310 --> 02:56:50.510]  No.
[02:56:50.870 --> 02:56:55.775]  I mean, you know, it's like, they don't, they, but because they put the methodology out, it's like it's okay.
[02:56:56.336 --> 02:56:58.639]  Oh, we stack to deck, we admit we do, so it's alright.
[02:56:58.659 --> 02:56:58.739]  What?
[02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:01.982]  No, it's not true.
[02:57:02.263 --> 02:57:07.708]  The only way you know that the true vision is looking under undulterated lenses is if you're on the ground.
[02:57:08.089 --> 02:57:09.170]  And I'm on the ground, brother.
[02:57:09.490 --> 02:57:11.753]  And I'm in the hood, no mistaking.
[02:57:12.233 --> 02:57:15.176]  And these individuals are walking around talking about, I'm going to vote for Trump.
[02:57:15.757 --> 02:57:20.101]  And it has very little to do with what it is that they think they can get from him.
[02:57:20.601 --> 02:57:22.723]  It's what it is they've been waiting for.
[02:57:22.803 --> 02:57:24.705]  They've been waiting for a change and a growth.
[02:57:24.725 --> 02:57:26.506]  They didn't get that from the previous administration.
[02:57:26.987 --> 02:57:29.489]  And they feel abandoned by the current administration.
[02:57:29.869 --> 02:57:31.391]  And so they're going to do whatever they can to tackle that.
[02:57:31.411 --> 02:57:32.572]  That's what I'm seeing on the streets.
[02:57:32.912 --> 02:57:33.693]  I mean, I would say
[02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:42.122]  Half the black people I talk to say they like Trump, but they're almost embarrassed, like, well, Alex, I can tell you, but, you know, my neighbors don't like it.
[02:57:42.162 --> 02:57:45.563]  And so I think if people just get past this fear and come out of the closet.
[02:57:45.703 --> 02:57:46.143]  That's right.
[02:57:46.283 --> 02:57:46.603]  That's right.
[02:57:46.623 --> 02:57:48.464]  And I talked about that, you know, in the speech.
[02:57:48.524 --> 02:57:58.267]  And I'm hoping that Donald Trump will bring more black surrogates at these rallies so that you can dispel the myth that blacks aren't coming out.
[02:57:58.327 --> 02:58:01.388]  And I'm not talking about like entertainment.
[02:58:01.568 --> 02:58:04.589]  You know, Alex, I'm talking about giving a real speech to people.
[02:58:05.009 --> 02:58:07.411]  That's the kind of surrogate he needs out there right now.
[02:58:07.751 --> 02:58:08.331]  Absolutely.
[02:58:08.371 --> 02:58:10.673]  He needs to absolutely hammer the daylights out of the globalists.
[02:58:10.693 --> 02:58:12.734]  The problem is a lot of times he does, the media doesn't cover it.
[02:58:13.014 --> 02:58:13.234]  Yeah.
[02:58:13.274 --> 02:58:16.016]  So we have to get the videos, we have to get the raw stuff, we have to put it out.
[02:58:16.396 --> 02:58:20.058]  Like InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and DrugsReport.com are doing.
[02:58:20.278 --> 02:58:21.739]  And that's why they said they want to censor Trump.
[02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:28.624]  I mean, they have these fake debate coming up where he's back to back with Hillary, but then he doesn't get to ask her questions.
[02:58:28.644 --> 02:58:29.244]  That's not a debate.
[02:58:29.344 --> 02:58:30.185]  No, no.
[02:58:30.205 --> 02:58:31.085]  She's been quiet, what, over 260 days now?
[02:58:32.961 --> 02:58:37.622]  Listen, I really believe she's got serious health problems, and the word is brain tumor.
[02:58:37.642 --> 02:58:42.524]  The brain tumor was removed back in 2012, and it's growing back.
[02:58:43.424 --> 02:58:46.525]  So that's why she is not looking too hot.
[02:58:47.125 --> 02:58:49.346]  That's the word, brain tumor.
[02:58:49.426 --> 02:58:49.826]  We'll be back.

[03:00:02.998 --> 03:00:05.605]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:17.866 --> 03:00:19.407]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:19.748 --> 03:00:26.052]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:26.333 --> 03:00:27.834]  The answer is info war.
[03:00:28.654 --> 03:00:32.837]  The answer is reclaiming our basic roots and what works for a civilization.
[03:00:34.419 --> 03:00:35.339]  Responsibility.
[03:00:35.680 --> 03:00:36.220]  Discipline.
[03:00:36.620 --> 03:00:37.061]  Pride.
[03:00:37.501 --> 03:00:37.901]  Honor.
[03:00:38.882 --> 03:00:39.322]  Strength.
[03:00:39.843 --> 03:00:40.283]  Courage.
[03:00:42.244 --> 03:00:45.567]  And people are desperate for it, like a man underwater who wants oxygen.
[03:00:45.987 --> 03:00:46.668]  I'm desperate for it.
[03:00:47.765 --> 03:00:49.305]  The New World Order wants to make us weak.
[03:00:49.926 --> 03:00:50.626]  They can rule us.
[03:00:51.486 --> 03:00:53.607]  I say folks that act like that are the ones that are weak.
[03:00:55.767 --> 03:00:57.468]  We're going to go to some more of your phone calls here.
[03:00:57.828 --> 03:01:02.549]  I am really honored to have R. W. Bray, rwbray.com.
[03:01:02.990 --> 03:01:05.610]  He's the Black Engagement Director of the Republican Party of Texas.
[03:01:06.431 --> 03:01:11.972]  And it is exciting to see the Patriot Liberty Movement taking over the Republican Party, because it's got its own share of problems.
[03:01:11.992 --> 03:01:14.193]  But this revolution of Trump taking the party over,
[03:01:15.618 --> 03:01:18.840]  They may try to take it back, but they are, they are, you know what, in their britches.
[03:01:19.461 --> 03:01:19.681]  Yes.
[03:01:20.341 --> 03:01:22.483]  I'm happy for the RPTU.
[03:01:22.563 --> 03:01:24.184]  Pulling apart Texas, finally growing up.
[03:01:24.384 --> 03:01:28.367]  We're doing things that no other state is doing, and I love the fact that it's coming out of Texas.
[03:01:29.288 --> 03:01:29.728]  I really do.
[03:01:29.828 --> 03:01:30.609]  I'm proud of Texas!
[03:01:31.701 --> 03:01:34.864]  Texas always has that cliche, growing up you're rebellious, whatever you've been told is great.
[03:01:35.424 --> 03:01:49.557]  But I mean, now that I've grown up, I know my parents and grandparents, and Texas isn't perfect, but compared to a lot of the places in the world, whatever, it is true, like, the original Texans I knew were just, no matter what color they were, were just honorable, straight shooting, and tough.
[03:01:49.757 --> 03:01:50.138]  That's right.
[03:01:52.264 --> 03:01:53.705]  Texas is at the head of the resistance.
[03:01:53.725 --> 03:01:55.566]  That's what Obama calls me, the man from Texas.
[03:01:55.926 --> 03:01:57.087]  And I love the fact he won't say my name.
[03:01:57.107 --> 03:01:58.488]  He goes, you know, that's out of Texas.
[03:01:58.548 --> 03:02:00.870]  And the media's like, whoa.
[03:02:00.990 --> 03:02:01.930]  It's almost better.
[03:02:01.950 --> 03:02:03.271]  It's like the name they won't say.
[03:02:04.852 --> 03:02:08.375]  Actually, I can feel the eye of Sauron looking at me, though.
[03:02:08.415 --> 03:02:09.616]  This is quite a responsibility.
[03:02:09.636 --> 03:02:10.716]  These people are bad news.
[03:02:10.756 --> 03:02:11.577]  That's why I joke about it.
[03:02:12.377 --> 03:02:14.779]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Minnesota.
[03:02:14.859 --> 03:02:15.740]  You're on the air.
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:16.000]  Go ahead.
[03:02:17.625 --> 03:02:19.345]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on the show.
[03:02:19.525 --> 03:02:21.626]  I literally just started listening, love it.
[03:02:21.666 --> 03:02:33.849]  But commenting on the whole charter schools and diversity that you guys spoke about earlier, I went to one of the largest high schools in Minnesota and most publicly funded and we had diversity programs everywhere.
[03:02:33.869 --> 03:02:37.990]  And as we got older into school, the more divided it became.
[03:02:38.050 --> 03:02:40.070]  We had groups where... It's in there to do it!
[03:02:40.090 --> 03:02:42.031]  They go, they're failing in all the university studies.
[03:02:42.231 --> 03:02:42.951]  It's getting worse!
[03:02:43.191 --> 03:02:46.112]  It's designed to make us all racist, crazy people.
[03:02:46.152 --> 03:02:46.532]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:02:47.805 --> 03:02:54.789]  Oh yeah, and it would be divided up so that the Somalian refugees would be on the East End, the African Americans would be on the West.
[03:02:54.970 --> 03:02:58.332]  Nobody really came together and we were in elementary school.
[03:02:58.532 --> 03:03:00.233]  That's how you run a prison.
[03:03:00.453 --> 03:03:01.414]  It's prison management.
[03:03:01.434 --> 03:03:02.414]  They're just putting us all in groups.
[03:03:02.474 --> 03:03:02.734]  Yeah.
[03:03:03.915 --> 03:03:04.415]  Definitely.
[03:03:04.495 --> 03:03:05.056]  No question.
[03:03:05.478 --> 03:03:06.939]  And the teachers, thereby, don't want to do it.
[03:03:06.959 --> 03:03:08.840]  They're like, why is this so horrible?
[03:03:09.340 --> 03:03:10.461]  Because it's designed to be.
[03:03:10.621 --> 03:03:11.681]  That is a sad reality.
[03:03:11.841 --> 03:03:20.846]  I had a conversation with Tom Meckler, who's the chairman of the RPT, and we talked about how the answer to compete with these failing ISDs and, like you said, the separation
[03:03:21.726 --> 03:03:24.688]  It's to make sure you have charter schools and academies to challenge it.
[03:03:24.708 --> 03:03:28.951]  I can't remember any institution that deserves a monopoly over education.
[03:03:29.491 --> 03:03:31.933]  And the way they do it is they corral people.
[03:03:32.313 --> 03:03:32.834]  Absolutely.
[03:03:32.854 --> 03:03:35.515]  The blacks are here, the Latinos are here, the whites are here.
[03:03:35.916 --> 03:03:37.677]  That doesn't encourage anyone to work together.
[03:03:38.584 --> 03:03:43.926]  And then they act like it's desegregation when all they do is throw people together and then divide them, even worse.
[03:03:43.946 --> 03:03:45.827]  I mean, this is some slick stuff.
[03:03:45.867 --> 03:03:46.848]  Yeah, it's strategic.
[03:03:46.968 --> 03:03:47.908]  Alex, it's sad.
[03:03:48.789 --> 03:03:51.850]  But the great part is, it's like those hidden pictures they hang on the wall.
[03:03:51.990 --> 03:03:55.132]  When you don't see it, you feel dumb, but as soon as you see it, it's like, oh, why didn't I see that before?
[03:03:55.752 --> 03:03:56.252]  I believe that.
[03:03:56.732 --> 03:03:57.753]  I'll tell you who does see it.
[03:03:57.773 --> 03:04:00.774]  The Democrats probably know exactly what they're doing, and they've mastered it.
[03:04:01.154 --> 03:04:06.537]  And instead we wake up and we have advocates who get out there and talk about it, they'll continue to throw the wool over our eyes.
[03:04:07.481 --> 03:04:09.802]  Mike, did anybody else figure out what was going on when you were in Minnesota?
[03:04:11.123 --> 03:04:22.889]  Well, Alex, the funny story is, one of our history teachers, I mean, as we got older, I probably learned the most amount of facts when I was in elementary school in terms of history, and it just turned into more social arguments as we got into high school.
[03:04:23.229 --> 03:04:25.170]  I graduated from high school five years ago.
[03:04:25.845 --> 03:04:33.748]  And one of our teachers actually said that he couldn't wait for the baby boomer generation to die off, that we're Republicans, because then the real issues would be addressed.
[03:04:33.908 --> 03:04:34.468]  Exactly.
[03:04:34.508 --> 03:04:38.809]  Like, we get somewhere once you die, which is total totalitarianism.
[03:04:40.150 --> 03:04:40.390]  Yeah.
[03:04:40.610 --> 03:04:43.891]  They don't know that the next crop of folks will be taught, get rid of these people, you get something.
[03:04:43.911 --> 03:04:44.732]  It's like Bill Gates.
[03:04:45.052 --> 03:04:47.332]  If we don't give an old lady treatment, we can hire ten teachers.
[03:04:47.352 --> 03:04:50.634]  The teachers are like, people die and I get things?
[03:04:50.714 --> 03:04:50.934]  No.
[03:04:51.194 --> 03:04:54.615]  You build an economy, you take care of old people, and that builds an economy.
[03:04:56.756 --> 03:04:58.537]  You get the service and quality you demand.
[03:04:58.577 --> 03:04:59.478]  It's called civilization.
[03:04:59.578 --> 03:05:01.020]  I'm really impressed with the work you're doing.
[03:05:01.160 --> 03:05:01.760]  Thank you so much.
[03:05:02.121 --> 03:05:02.982]  God bless you, sir.
[03:05:03.322 --> 03:05:04.303]  Folks, you can go to the website.
[03:05:04.663 --> 03:05:06.525]  It's rwmray.com.
[03:05:06.905 --> 03:05:07.826]  David Knight's coming up.
[03:05:07.866 --> 03:05:08.547]  I'm going to introduce him.
[03:05:08.587 --> 03:05:09.048]  Stay with us.
[03:05:10.849 --> 03:05:13.252]  They said in October I'd be dead in six months.
[03:05:15.225 --> 03:05:19.568]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[03:05:20.309 --> 03:05:29.655]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[03:05:29.796 --> 03:05:32.397]  We came, we saw, he died.
[03:05:34.159 --> 03:05:38.982]  The intervention led by NATO to topple Qaddafi has led to a failed state.
[03:05:43.752 --> 03:05:50.788]  Maybe Libya was not perfect under Gaddafi, but it had, even if to some extent, a functioning government, one unified country.
[03:05:51.189 --> 03:05:52.312]  It was a sovereign state.
[03:05:53.874 --> 03:06:00.598]  Libya now has two rival governments, a civil war that has left over 4,000 people dead, and its cities are in ruin.
[03:06:00.799 --> 03:06:07.363]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[03:06:07.703 --> 03:06:12.146]  Women are treated, discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[03:06:12.506 --> 03:06:16.009]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[03:06:16.069 --> 03:06:16.929]  They're mistreated.
[03:06:17.630 --> 03:06:18.991]  She claims to be their champion.
[03:06:19.291 --> 03:06:20.211]  We led ISIS.
[03:06:21.212 --> 03:06:22.193]  Take this position.
[03:06:22.853 --> 03:06:28.718]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[03:06:28.998 --> 03:06:40.487]  We had this brilliant idea that we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force of Mujahideen, equip them with stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets inside Afghanistan.
[03:06:41.167 --> 03:06:42.348]  And we were successful.
[03:06:42.388 --> 03:06:44.570]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[03:06:44.690 --> 03:06:51.176]  When Vince Foster left his White House office on that July day in 1993, he told his secretary that he would be back.
[03:06:51.937 --> 03:06:55.960]  But the Deputy White House Counsel and boyhood friend of Bill Clinton never returned.
[03:06:56.281 --> 03:06:59.544]  There has been this urgency to end this.
[03:07:00.024 --> 03:07:03.607]  And, you know, historically that makes no sense.
[03:07:03.808 --> 03:07:08.552]  We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.
[03:07:08.752 --> 03:07:18.214]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[03:07:18.254 --> 03:07:20.014]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:07:20.415 --> 03:07:31.837]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[03:07:32.117 --> 03:07:36.839]  Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks.
[03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:40.301]  We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton.
[03:07:40.541 --> 03:07:45.544]  You know, the emails we published show that Hillary Clinton is receiving constant updates.
[03:07:46.593 --> 03:07:48.896]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[03:08:19.671 --> 03:08:24.455]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:24.495 --> 03:08:29.399]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:49.995 --> 03:08:54.319]  Whipping up a Neo-McCarthyist hysteria about Russia.
[03:08:55.940 --> 03:09:02.145]  Any serious analyst understands that China and the United States are the only real games in town.
[03:09:03.186 --> 03:09:07.290]  China has ten times the population of Russia, seven times the GDP.
[03:09:08.410 --> 03:09:10.292]  Russia has the GDP of Italy.
[03:09:14.189 --> 03:09:15.910]  It makes provocative statements and so on.
[03:09:15.970 --> 03:09:28.499]  It's interesting and of course within its own neck of the woods, countries between Russia and China, Caucasus and so on, of course Russia is very significant to them.
[03:09:28.959 --> 03:09:31.821]  But on the world stage, Russia is a big player.
[03:09:37.398 --> 03:09:57.149]  That attempted reframing by Hillary Clinton to declare media organizations that are publishing material that shows illicit behavior in the DNC to fix the election for her as somehow us being Russian agents.
[03:09:57.949 --> 03:10:04.953]  Similar criticism has emerged from people connected to her campaign, To The Intercept, where Glenn Greenwald works.
[03:10:05.926 --> 03:10:16.070]  Her campaign has effectively called, and maybe even directly called, Donald Trump, the opposition leader in this case, a Russian agent.
[03:10:17.270 --> 03:10:26.414]  Jill Stein, the Greens Party candidate, effectively the fourth candidate in terms of numbers, has also been called a Russian agent.
[03:10:26.594 --> 03:10:28.955]  This is a neo-McCarthyist hysteria.
[03:10:29.375 --> 03:10:34.837]  What kind of press environment is this going to lead to post-election?
[03:10:36.768 --> 03:10:53.941]  The American press, the American liberal press, in falling over themselves to defend Hillary Clinton, are erecting a demon that is going to put nooses around everyone's necks as soon as she wins this election, which she is almost certainly going to do.
[03:10:55.922 --> 03:11:02.988]  That is part of the, and I don't overuse the term epic, so much stuff is epic now because there's a quickening happening.
[03:11:03.820 --> 03:11:06.942]  And the whole interview is on Infowars.com right now.
[03:11:07.042 --> 03:11:09.544]  Everybody needs to spread this interview to the four corners of the planet.
[03:11:10.905 --> 03:11:15.868]  I mean that figuratively before the New York Times says that I believe the Earth is flat or four-cornered.
[03:11:18.530 --> 03:11:21.592]  You have Trump going to Mexico and saying globalism is screwing both our countries.
[03:11:24.124 --> 03:11:25.644]  Carlos Slim, by the way, isn't even a Mexican.
[03:11:25.764 --> 03:11:26.885]  You can't make this stuff up.
[03:11:27.525 --> 03:11:29.625]  And they are screwing everyone over.
[03:11:30.326 --> 03:11:31.086]  Let's come together.
[03:11:31.126 --> 03:11:33.186]  And the Mexican president comes out and says, I like Trump.
[03:11:33.887 --> 03:11:35.207]  And then Trump says they hit it off.
[03:11:35.347 --> 03:11:37.567]  And you can see the body language when they're out there on stage together.
[03:11:38.848 --> 03:11:41.348]  Because they misrepresent everything Trump says.
[03:11:42.569 --> 03:11:45.169]  Trump's like, you grab people that come in from Guatemala.
[03:11:45.389 --> 03:11:47.670]  You can't have your border open and give people free stuff.
[03:11:48.050 --> 03:11:49.791]  The Mexicans are like, oh, yeah, that's true.
[03:11:49.811 --> 03:11:50.911]  I don't dislike you.
[03:11:54.062 --> 03:11:57.044]  I mean, we gotta have doors on our houses, people.
[03:11:58.325 --> 03:11:59.306]  And I'll be quite frank with you.
[03:12:00.106 --> 03:12:01.187]  And Trump's talked about this too.
[03:12:02.328 --> 03:12:06.211]  I don't care if you're Hispanic, black, white, or whoever you are, Americans have killed our children.
[03:12:06.331 --> 03:12:08.892]  Well, credit the Hispanics, they haven't done as much.
[03:12:11.414 --> 03:12:13.576]  So, Hispanics deserve to take over the United States.
[03:12:14.707 --> 03:12:16.888]  I mean, quite frankly, it's the Darwin Award.
[03:12:17.488 --> 03:12:20.590]  You kill your kids, you deserve to not be around anymore.
[03:12:21.350 --> 03:12:23.792]  Fine, repopulate the United States with Mexicans.
[03:12:24.412 --> 03:12:29.955]  The point is that they're politically bringing them in and brainwashing them to carry out the New World Order.
[03:12:30.235 --> 03:12:31.236]  It must be stopped.
[03:12:32.176 --> 03:12:34.777]  The brainwashing, the anchor babies, the free crap.
[03:12:34.898 --> 03:12:36.578]  It's not fair, it's not right.
[03:12:37.459 --> 03:12:40.440]  The Ford Foundation instilling all this race baiting.
[03:12:40.801 --> 03:12:42.361]  Why would the Ford Foundation give $100 million to BLM?
[03:12:44.551 --> 03:12:51.915]  Because they're going to create basket cases where everyone has chips on their shoulders and never overcomes and gets stronger.
[03:12:51.975 --> 03:12:53.796]  That's how you become a force.
[03:12:54.276 --> 03:12:58.378]  No, you just get a chip and your whole job in the world is having a chip on your shoulder.
[03:12:59.899 --> 03:13:01.340]  It's the essence of immaturity.
[03:13:02.460 --> 03:13:06.222]  And I used to wonder while I was working on ranches and stuff, the cowboys would be mean to me and stuff at first.
[03:13:06.563 --> 03:13:07.943]  They were just testing to see who I was.
[03:13:07.963 --> 03:13:12.326]  And then by the end of the summer, they were like, tears in their eyes.
[03:13:12.366 --> 03:13:12.846]  I was leaving.
[03:13:14.659 --> 03:13:17.600]  And I never sit there with people in my life and mess with them up front.
[03:13:17.620 --> 03:13:18.280]  I guess I do now.
[03:13:18.300 --> 03:13:22.000]  I need to mess with people when they're first in my life, or have a job, or whatever, just to see who you are.
[03:13:22.020 --> 03:13:23.020]  Let's mess with you.
[03:13:23.040 --> 03:13:25.041]  Let's find out what's really going on under here.
[03:13:26.021 --> 03:13:31.482]  But as you get older, you learn this stuff, and then you look at what the media's doing, and you're like, oh my God, these are some nasty people.
[03:13:31.882 --> 03:13:35.263]  Now, I want to turn the baton over to David Knight, who, by the way, is always a handsome guy.
[03:13:36.223 --> 03:13:37.983]  But he looks like the most interesting man right now.
[03:13:38.023 --> 03:13:39.223]  I'm ready for a Dos Equis commercial.
[03:13:39.603 --> 03:13:43.284]  I think, David, we found your look with that gray suit and black shirt.
[03:13:45.673 --> 03:13:46.694]  You look pretty sharp over there.
[03:13:47.035 --> 03:13:47.575]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:13:47.975 --> 03:13:51.599]  Yeah, I'm going to talk about what I call Trump's Mexican Summit, Alex.
[03:13:51.659 --> 03:14:03.550]  It's pretty amazing because even his hardcore critics, NPR, The Washington Post, even Bill Kristol are talking about how he really had a huge win yesterday.
[03:14:03.570 --> 03:14:04.051]  It was a grand slam.
[03:14:04.091 --> 03:14:05.452]  It's absolutely amazing.
[03:14:05.612 --> 03:14:09.554]  Yeah, and you know of course also we look at what's going on with SpaceX.
[03:14:09.894 --> 03:14:15.797]  I think there's a lot of metaphors to be seen here, but one of the things I want to talk about was what you're just talking about with Julian Assange.
[03:14:15.857 --> 03:14:21.260]  He said what the New York Times is selling is conspiracy and not journalism.
[03:14:21.800 --> 03:14:22.680]  That's absolutely true.
[03:14:22.940 --> 03:14:35.544]  There's not an ounce of real facts in this, and yet this conspiracy that the Russians are behind everything that happens bad to the Democrats, that's being used in some very serious ways as we look at Homeland Security.
[03:14:35.584 --> 03:14:40.565]  I thought it was very interesting in that article that you had, the interview that you had earlier today.
[03:14:41.525 --> 03:14:50.687]  We're talking to Scott Adams, and at the very end of the interview, you pointed out to him, you know, Homeland Security is angling to take over our elections, and he goes, no, no, that can't be true.
[03:14:51.007 --> 03:14:55.128]  I mean, it's just so far out that people can't accept this.
[03:14:55.228 --> 03:14:57.508]  And listen, I'm even conditioned with normalcy bias.
[03:14:57.808 --> 03:15:05.730]  I should have been talking all day, in fact, I thought of this earlier and didn't get back to it, I should have been talking all day, productions, showing it, I had this whole plan to
[03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:16.445]  You know, get clips of Obama denying it, and saying, and then now they admit it, and showing how mainstream news clips admitting that Goldman Sachs is installing presidents in Europe, and explain.
[03:15:17.625 --> 03:15:21.427]  Davos is calling for the end of elected governments.
[03:15:22.228 --> 03:15:24.909]  I mean, it's like, do you understand folks?
[03:15:25.149 --> 03:15:28.431]  Hillary's putting out fundraising letters saying, shut down
[03:15:29.824 --> 03:15:33.526]  The alt-right, and then she comes out and names yours truly.
[03:15:34.226 --> 03:15:36.368]  I mean, this is it, people.
[03:15:36.448 --> 03:15:36.948]  It's real.
[03:15:37.288 --> 03:15:42.451]  It hit me like a ton of bricks this morning, and I was absolutely upset.
[03:15:42.571 --> 03:15:44.012]  I never almost get hysterical.
[03:15:44.032 --> 03:15:46.353]  I was just like really concerned.
[03:15:46.373 --> 03:15:47.013]  I was like, what is it?
[03:15:47.053 --> 03:15:47.313]  What is it?
[03:15:47.373 --> 03:15:48.074]  I went, oh my God.
[03:15:48.094 --> 03:15:50.575]  It was all the news I read early that morning before I exercised.
[03:15:51.636 --> 03:15:55.378]  They clearly, there's a demarcation line in the last few days, and you can say it started
[03:15:56.710 --> 03:15:58.333]  September 1st, 2016.
[03:15:58.413 --> 03:15:59.494]  We're in the New World Order.
[03:15:59.594 --> 03:16:00.155]  It's on.
[03:16:00.856 --> 03:16:04.282]  Everything is moving at... Let me get this exactly right.
[03:16:05.618 --> 03:16:09.661]  Their takeover is now moving at 20 times the previous speed, and I mean that number.
[03:16:09.981 --> 03:16:10.841]  I really thought about that.
[03:16:11.662 --> 03:16:13.603]  Before it was all incremental testing, testing, testing.
[03:16:13.663 --> 03:16:14.564]  It's now BOOM!
[03:16:14.904 --> 03:16:15.264]  BOOM!
[03:16:15.384 --> 03:16:16.625]  I mean, it is BOOM!
[03:16:16.885 --> 03:16:18.446]  We are in it now, David.
[03:16:18.806 --> 03:16:22.549]  You know, Alex, they always say, how does a very rich person go bankrupt?
[03:16:22.569 --> 03:16:26.771]  They asked a rich person once and he said, well, gradually at first and then very rapidly.
[03:16:27.092 --> 03:16:28.513]  And that's what we're seeing happening here.
[03:16:28.553 --> 03:16:29.353]  They've got this deadline.
[03:16:29.373 --> 03:16:33.816]  They've been talking about massive structural reorganization of the global governance.
[03:16:34.036 --> 03:16:35.316]  I totally forgot, you're right.
[03:16:35.376 --> 03:16:37.477]  Germany admits they're on the verge of collapse, exactly.
[03:16:37.657 --> 03:16:39.457]  And the average person, it's too scary.
[03:16:39.637 --> 03:16:41.077]  Oh, they're not taking over the elections.
[03:16:41.417 --> 03:16:44.778]  Oh, Germany's not saying get emergency supplies, prepare for a massive emergency.
[03:16:44.978 --> 03:16:49.059]  And I'm so conditioned, I've been saying it for so long, I'm not even up here tuning our horn, David.
[03:16:49.299 --> 03:16:49.479]  Yeah.
[03:16:49.659 --> 03:16:50.719]  In fact, I've got the articles right here.
[03:16:50.979 --> 03:16:53.480]  Deutsche Bank refuses clients demand for physical gold.
[03:16:54.140 --> 03:16:55.820]  And it goes on and on and on.
[03:16:56.040 --> 03:16:58.981]  And they admit that they're telling... David, you covered it last Friday.
[03:16:59.321 --> 03:17:00.581]  What do you think the Germans
[03:17:02.079 --> 03:17:07.444]  The national government says get ready for a serious emergency, get food and water and the Germans clean the shelves off.
[03:17:07.484 --> 03:17:08.325]  What is going on there?
[03:17:08.665 --> 03:17:16.033]  Oh, they're doing a lot of prepping and I think the key thing is there's a massive run on home safes because they can't trust the banks.
[03:17:16.653 --> 03:17:17.214]  You've got this
[03:17:17.774 --> 03:17:19.454]  This negative interest rate that's going on.
[03:17:19.494 --> 03:17:22.255]  They know that they could confiscate their money and call it a haircut.
[03:17:22.715 --> 03:17:26.936]  They don't even want to put their money in safe deposit boxes because they know they'll steal that.
[03:17:27.056 --> 03:17:32.917]  So you've got this massive movement, a shortage of safes because everybody wants to take their cash home and put it there.
[03:17:32.957 --> 03:17:33.297]  Why not?
[03:17:33.357 --> 03:17:36.018]  Why should they have to pay the banks to save their money?
[03:17:36.338 --> 03:17:43.299]  Instead of the banks paying them any interest, they have to pay the banks and then have it subject to confiscation or just outright theft if
[03:17:43.539 --> 03:17:44.560]  And by the way, U.S.
[03:17:44.580 --> 03:17:46.342]  banks, you know, in the new stress test reports.
[03:17:46.382 --> 03:17:47.002]  I didn't even cover this.
[03:17:47.062 --> 03:17:47.963]  I read this like a month ago.
[03:17:47.983 --> 03:17:52.887]  I think it was Market Watch, and I didn't even cover it because I've been so close to it for so long.
[03:17:52.907 --> 03:17:55.249]  I don't want to just say, we told you, we told you, we told you.
[03:17:55.790 --> 03:17:57.131]  So I stuck it in the stack, David.
[03:17:57.891 --> 03:17:58.572]  We should pull it up.
[03:17:59.813 --> 03:18:01.695]  It was some kind of headline like, let me go to memory here.
[03:18:01.715 --> 03:18:03.196]  Let me see if I can still do this exact memory.
[03:18:06.384 --> 03:18:06.724]  U.S.
[03:18:06.864 --> 03:18:11.387]  banks in next crisis might need U.S.
[03:18:12.148 --> 03:18:14.989]  Greece-style bail-in.
[03:18:15.410 --> 03:18:23.615]  And then it went on to say they're preparing and looking at taking money out of your account or negative interest rates where you pay them to have an account or pay them to have money.
[03:18:24.075 --> 03:18:29.479]  I mean, it's like they're actually in major publications now lubing us up
[03:18:30.379 --> 03:18:32.460]  For grabbing the money out of our accounts, David.
[03:18:32.901 --> 03:18:46.349]  Well, you know, that was one of the key things, I think, from Nigel Farage, I remember, was the time that he got up at the EU and he said, who are you to shut down the democratically elected leaders of Italy and Greece and put in these Goldman Sachs bankers?
[03:18:46.509 --> 03:18:47.650]  Who are you to override that?
[03:18:48.450 --> 03:18:48.970]  Let's say it again.
[03:18:49.231 --> 03:18:56.716]  Appointing Presidents and Prime Ministers, and then having Soros get up and brag about it at Davos with his little demon egghead.
[03:18:56.736 --> 03:19:05.382]  And it's like, what the... You got an arch-criminal war criminal overthrowing all these countries, running around appointing leaders of countries?
[03:19:05.962 --> 03:19:11.410]  Well Alex, you know that story that was on Drudge a couple of days ago, it was a Breitbart story with Bill Clinton.
[03:19:11.430 --> 03:19:18.682]  They went back, they looked at the Clinton Global Initiative, where he was talking to the yogurt billionaire, Chobani Yogurt.
[03:19:19.281 --> 03:19:25.445]  And they were talking about how they could bring in these Syrian refugees, how they were the greatest people, the greatest workers and entrepreneurs in the world.
[03:19:25.485 --> 03:19:26.366]  They could bring them in.
[03:19:26.626 --> 03:19:28.467]  There's 10,000 empty homes in Detroit.
[03:19:28.687 --> 03:19:34.211]  And you know, Hillary Clinton's policy will bring in more people in her first term than the entire population of Detroit.
[03:19:34.231 --> 03:19:35.612]  Yeah, they're saying, Americans don't matter.
[03:19:35.932 --> 03:19:38.954]  We're going to resettle you and then give them welfare money.
[03:19:39.214 --> 03:19:39.454]  That's right.
[03:19:39.474 --> 03:19:41.336]  Like, like crops of things that are growing.
[03:19:41.376 --> 03:19:41.976]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:19:42.096 --> 03:19:49.582]  And it's even worse, Alex, because I covered that on Tuesday's Nightly News with Leanne McAdoo, the fact that this guy, who is this Chobani Yogurt guy?
[03:19:49.622 --> 03:19:55.547]  Well, he's a Turkish citizen who is sitting on the board of the New York Fed, setting our monetary policy.
[03:19:55.587 --> 03:19:57.248]  He's not even an American citizen.
[03:19:57.528 --> 03:20:05.134]  And furthermore, he's sitting there with Bill Clinton and the Clinton Global Initiative and talking about how they're going to establish immigration policy.
[03:20:05.195 --> 03:20:06.876]  He's not even an American citizen.
[03:20:07.236 --> 03:20:10.639]  And he's using these people as slaves when they come into his factory.
[03:20:10.779 --> 03:20:16.162]  And they're going to have basically the UN, EU oversee our election and have Homeland Security run it.
[03:20:16.302 --> 03:20:18.824]  But, Donald Trump's wrong that they're going to have Feds involved.
[03:20:19.004 --> 03:20:19.464]  And I'm wrong.
[03:20:19.724 --> 03:20:20.204]  Yeah.
[03:20:20.385 --> 03:20:22.186]  Oh, the creature in Texas is wrong.
[03:20:22.206 --> 03:20:22.526]  I'm sorry.
[03:20:22.966 --> 03:20:23.666]  Dare not say her name.
[03:20:23.907 --> 03:20:26.348]  Now, I'm going to hand the baton to you in a moment.
[03:20:26.448 --> 03:20:29.290]  I don't have a lot to cover here today, but let me just add this.
[03:20:30.888 --> 03:20:33.449]  Something, I didn't drop the ball today, but it's epic level.
[03:20:33.489 --> 03:20:34.250]  Again, I use that word.
[03:20:34.330 --> 03:20:34.970]  It is big.
[03:20:35.070 --> 03:20:35.591]  It's biggest.
[03:20:36.131 --> 03:20:51.420]  They're announcing YouTube, Google, that the politically correct moderators that ban people for no reason, if they don't like what you're doing, they demonetize you, basically steal your money.
[03:20:52.320 --> 03:20:57.243]  That is the Chinese model and DrugsReport.com is linked to our article on it.
[03:20:58.894 --> 03:21:11.103]  Where they say you're going to have a social credit rating that the state and the telecoms and the big internet companies decide, down to the point of not being able to buy or sell online, and then finally not even having a job.
[03:21:11.463 --> 03:21:15.186]  This is the communist Chinese model to control their 1,300,000,000 people.
[03:21:15.886 --> 03:21:18.648]  And you've been to China, you're adopted daughter from China, you've seen the slavery.
[03:21:18.908 --> 03:21:21.310]  I mean, you described it to me, the hellish orphanages.
[03:21:21.750 --> 03:21:23.932]  Imagine, this is how they control these poor people.
[03:21:25.225 --> 03:21:26.586]  And now they're bringing it here.
[03:21:26.686 --> 03:21:31.428]  I mean, this is so draconian, so flamingly evil.
[03:21:31.448 --> 03:21:34.550]  But it's just in terms of service agreement.
[03:21:34.570 --> 03:21:37.891]  Like, oh, Samsung, we're watching you off the camera at home.
[03:21:38.512 --> 03:21:39.472]  Behave yourself.
[03:21:39.572 --> 03:21:41.093]  And everybody's like, OK, they're watching me.
[03:21:41.113 --> 03:21:41.513]  Big deal.
[03:21:41.793 --> 03:21:45.835]  I mean, it's just... And imagine, David, it's going to get crazier and crazier and crazier.
[03:21:45.855 --> 03:21:46.856]  And I'm going to say this, then I'm done.
[03:21:47.961 --> 03:21:48.921]  Listen to me carefully, folks.
[03:21:49.661 --> 03:22:03.164]  This signifies how desperate they are that they're accelerating their plan, which is way behind schedule, because they know people now understand globalism and the system and they get the con, and it's exponentially growing.
[03:22:03.484 --> 03:22:09.286]  And so when you see all this draconian action, understand it's scary, it's serious, we've got to fight it, but it's a sign of their weakness.
[03:22:09.306 --> 03:22:11.806]  They are showing themselves, they are moving quickly.
[03:22:12.166 --> 03:22:13.567]  China's never had freedom.
[03:22:13.807 --> 03:22:14.887]  They're great, smart people.
[03:22:15.327 --> 03:22:20.569]  But they never had a Magna Carta, never had a 1776, doesn't mean we're perfect, but we just got a few steps ahead of them.
[03:22:20.849 --> 03:22:25.151]  If the Chinese ever had free free market, they will take over the planet, and that's fine with me.
[03:22:25.632 --> 03:22:28.293]  The point is, is that the globalists don't want them to have that.
[03:22:28.833 --> 03:22:36.436]  And they treat them like trash, and they are totally abused, and it is so sad, and it is so out of control, and
[03:22:38.402 --> 03:22:41.525]  We have to understand that we are in the crucible right now.
[03:22:41.605 --> 03:22:42.726]  We are in the arena.
[03:22:43.127 --> 03:22:48.532]  This is history happening right now, and I can tell you what Donald Trump talked to the Mexican president about.
[03:22:48.792 --> 03:22:52.496]  The president may get pressured, he may say some bad things later, but he's said some nice things so far.
[03:22:52.576 --> 03:22:54.458]  So has Trump, said they really hit it off.
[03:22:54.778 --> 03:22:56.279]  And I know what Donald Trump said to him.
[03:22:56.660 --> 03:22:57.601]  Not because I talked to Donald Trump.
[03:22:59.104 --> 03:23:02.127]  But you watch, it might be six months, it might be a year, it might be tomorrow, it's going to come out.
[03:23:02.868 --> 03:23:06.591]  I said he should say, we're both being oppressed by globalism, let's come together.
[03:23:06.611 --> 03:23:11.176]  Because I know Trump's so informed, has generals advising him, so I'm just going to stop right there.
[03:23:11.857 --> 03:23:14.780]  I know the type of advice he's getting, I know the intel he's getting, that's why I know what he said.
[03:23:15.420 --> 03:23:22.948]  I know he leaned across and said, you want to free your people and actually let your country shine with their great ingenuity and all their hard work and smarts and innovation?
[03:23:24.355 --> 03:23:25.836]  You know they're laundering the drug money.
[03:23:25.856 --> 03:23:27.337]  You know the big banks run your country.
[03:23:27.377 --> 03:23:29.759]  You know you've sold your people out for generations.
[03:23:30.399 --> 03:23:31.300]  This can all change.
[03:23:31.500 --> 03:23:34.883]  I'm ready to break the will of the New World Order and we can have real prosperity.
[03:23:34.923 --> 03:23:35.523]  It's going to be hard.
[03:23:35.923 --> 03:23:40.427]  But if you want the civil war that was started, run by Washington folks, you can bet you're the globalist.
[03:23:41.559 --> 03:23:45.902]  I guarantee you Trump told him, I'm ready to stop the oppression of Mexico.
[03:23:46.463 --> 03:23:48.624]  Because I looked at that president closely on the CloserUp videos.
[03:23:49.145 --> 03:23:54.729]  He had tears in his eyes during part of it because no president or person about to be president would ever actually come and talk to him.
[03:23:55.249 --> 03:23:59.592]  Trump completely blew the blinders off that guy.
[03:23:59.652 --> 03:24:01.373]  He was like a deer in the headlights, folks.
[03:24:01.393 --> 03:24:03.155]  Because Trump is like Alex Jones.
[03:24:03.595 --> 03:24:06.917]  Imagine if I met with the Mexican president and I was about to be president, what I would say?
[03:24:06.937 --> 03:24:07.638]  It'd be that.
[03:24:08.018 --> 03:24:09.940]  I can guarantee you.
[03:24:10.580 --> 03:24:11.320]  That's what Trump said.
[03:24:11.580 --> 03:24:14.261]  Just as I said what Trump should say yesterday.
[03:24:14.481 --> 03:24:15.462]  He didn't hear that from me.
[03:24:15.482 --> 03:24:16.862]  He was on an airplane flying to Mexico then.
[03:24:18.003 --> 03:24:19.543]  The thing is, Trump doesn't listen to me.
[03:24:19.783 --> 03:24:24.165]  The reason I've talked to Trump and he clicks is it's all, it's like finishing each other's sentences.
[03:24:24.205 --> 03:24:26.425]  I'm going to stop right there because they make two stories out of it.
[03:24:26.666 --> 03:24:31.207]  The point is, Trump is so dialed in, it is crazy, okay?
[03:24:31.887 --> 03:24:33.828]  Heaven sent, okay?
[03:24:34.248 --> 03:24:35.749]  Now, that's all I'm telling you.
[03:24:36.869 --> 03:24:39.390]  I want to play one little clip to have some fun and then hand the baton to David Knight.
[03:24:40.560 --> 03:24:42.204]  People tell me take more time off, I need to.
[03:24:42.284 --> 03:24:50.962]  So we went out on some friends boat and Tim Kennedy, soldier, and some of the other soldiers, interesting fellows, went out there with us.
[03:24:52.110 --> 03:24:52.970]  That's what sinking up is about.
[03:25:11.540 --> 03:25:12.440]  You're on the same page.
[03:25:12.880 --> 03:25:14.681]  And that's what society's supposed to be like, folks.
[03:25:14.861 --> 03:25:17.162]  Honor and common sense, you sink.
[03:25:17.762 --> 03:25:19.542]  And the globalists are de-sinking us.
[03:25:20.142 --> 03:25:21.343]  Freedom is about sinking.
[03:25:21.363 --> 03:25:24.184]  It doesn't mean being on the same piece of paper.
[03:25:24.244 --> 03:25:27.004]  It means being in reality, and then it's a clear path.
[03:25:27.285 --> 03:25:31.006]  So, it's a funny little clip, but it's funny to know it wasn't scripted.
[03:25:32.146 --> 03:25:34.967]  It's like, I knew he would do it, I said it, it happened.
[03:25:35.007 --> 03:25:39.028]  And again, that's a little microcosm of what the media's trying to figure out with this Trump stuff and me.
[03:25:40.216 --> 03:25:42.658]  Look, Trump and I are tuned into the same spirit.
[03:25:43.259 --> 03:25:43.599]  You understand?
[03:25:43.619 --> 03:25:46.321]  The same animating... Folks, it is metaphysical.
[03:25:46.802 --> 03:25:47.442]  It's incredible.
[03:25:48.083 --> 03:25:48.744]  And it's happening.
[03:25:49.404 --> 03:25:50.545]  And I'm just gonna leave it right there.
[03:25:51.066 --> 03:25:51.406]  Okay?
[03:25:51.466 --> 03:25:53.568]  But... This is what's happening.
[03:25:53.648 --> 03:25:55.410]  It's biblical, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:25:55.430 --> 03:25:55.870]  Here's the clip.
[03:25:56.591 --> 03:25:57.712]  I like Hillary Clinton.
[03:25:58.112 --> 03:25:59.233]  You know, that's where I support.
[03:25:59.253 --> 03:26:01.375]  So, Tim Kennedy, I'm gonna support Hillary right now.
[03:26:01.495 --> 03:26:01.915]  NO!
[03:26:07.492 --> 03:26:10.074]  And again, that's just a microcosm of not scripting something.
[03:26:10.094 --> 03:26:12.657]  But it was scripted, because he got exactly what I was saying.
[03:26:12.697 --> 03:26:13.577]  We were synced.
[03:26:13.898 --> 03:26:14.698]  David Knight, take over.
[03:26:14.739 --> 03:26:16.460]  Thanks for letting me take over 25 minutes of the show.
[03:26:16.800 --> 03:26:17.321]  We love you.
[03:26:17.341 --> 03:26:17.881]  Please continue.
[03:26:18.322 --> 03:26:18.982]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[03:26:19.002 --> 03:26:26.789]  You know, one of the things that's very dangerous, we want to talk about what Julian Assange has said about Hillary's Un-American Activities Commission.
[03:26:26.809 --> 03:26:27.910]  Because that's basically what it is.
[03:26:27.930 --> 03:26:29.412]  Remember when we had the McCarthyism?
[03:26:29.952 --> 03:26:33.155]  We had the House Un-American Activities Committee, HUAC.
[03:26:33.395 --> 03:26:35.377]  You know, we don't even need to change the acronyms.
[03:26:35.517 --> 03:26:39.060]  You know, we should just stay with HUAC and just substitute for House Hillary.
[03:26:39.120 --> 03:26:43.724]  Because whenever anything happens to them, it's always, you're with the Russians.
[03:26:44.424 --> 03:26:46.266]  It's actually pretty funny when you look at it.
[03:26:47.027 --> 03:26:54.313]  But when we look at what's going on with Homeland Security, and I think we need to really delve into this and look at this carefully and think about what's going to happen with this.
[03:26:54.333 --> 03:26:55.314]  You know, we've got Jay Johnson.
[03:26:55.874 --> 03:27:02.079]  Who is whining about the fact that we've got 9,000 different jurisdictions running elections all over this country.
[03:27:02.800 --> 03:27:03.481]  That's a good thing.
[03:27:04.001 --> 03:27:07.204]  But it's not if you want centralized control.
[03:27:07.224 --> 03:27:10.647]  You have to understand these people want a command-control economy.
[03:27:11.067 --> 03:27:14.230]  They want central control of everything because they are authoritarians.
[03:27:16.001 --> 03:27:20.483]  Think about what is going to happen if we centralize control of our elections.
[03:27:20.523 --> 03:27:22.765]  It means that they're going to also standardize it.
[03:27:23.185 --> 03:27:24.445]  How are they going to standardize it?
[03:27:24.466 --> 03:27:27.687]  They're going to standardize it by making it more electronic.
[03:27:27.927 --> 03:27:29.868]  That is the key vulnerability.
[03:27:30.409 --> 03:27:32.550]  So here are these people where everything is being hacked.
[03:27:32.970 --> 03:27:34.011]  The DNC's being hacked.
[03:27:34.311 --> 03:27:35.272]  Hillary's being hacked.
[03:27:35.592 --> 03:27:40.175]  You've got personnel files from the federal government that have been hacked in a massive way.
[03:27:40.856 --> 03:27:42.937]  Even the NSA has been hacked.
[03:27:43.357 --> 03:27:45.839]  Their hacking code was hacked, okay?
[03:27:46.379 --> 03:27:48.681]  That's a recursive hack, I guess.
[03:27:48.981 --> 03:27:52.324]  They hacked their hacking code and put it on the internet for sale, okay?
[03:27:53.104 --> 03:27:54.425]  So, what would you want to do?
[03:27:54.465 --> 03:28:01.648]  I think you would want to not go into that environment until you've at least demonstrated that you have got some control over it, don't you?
[03:28:02.289 --> 03:28:05.370]  But instead, what they want to do is to standardize that.
[03:28:05.730 --> 03:28:07.011]  And that's really what's going to happen.
[03:28:07.031 --> 03:28:12.434]  They're going to make our election system even more vulnerable because they want to control it.
[03:28:12.994 --> 03:28:18.737]  Understand that the forefront of electronic elections has been Hugo Chavez's Venezuela.
[03:28:19.753 --> 03:28:29.618]  Smartmatic, the largest seller of electronic voting machines, was created by Hugo Chavez cronies in Venezuela to control the elections there.
[03:28:30.118 --> 03:28:35.981]  And as we talked about last night, they have a string of corruption throughout Central and South America, including the Philippines.
[03:28:36.001 --> 03:28:38.422]  They go in, they run these elections, all of a sudden, guess what?
[03:28:39.042 --> 03:28:42.144]  The system went down and we lost 25% of the votes.
[03:28:42.184 --> 03:28:46.547]  We don't have any audit trail for any of this stuff, but trust us, we know how they voted.
[03:28:47.047 --> 03:28:50.609]  We're going to tell you how 25% of the people voted, but there's no audit trail for this.
[03:28:50.949 --> 03:28:52.950]  This is the kind of corruption that we're looking at here.
[03:28:53.611 --> 03:28:56.633]  And this is something that happened two years ago in Brazil.
[03:28:57.273 --> 03:29:06.416]  People there accused a very unpopular socialist who was found guilty of all kinds of corruption, money laundering, campaign violation.
[03:29:06.496 --> 03:29:10.817]  Campaign contribution violation sounds very much like Hillary Clinton, doesn't it?
[03:29:10.857 --> 03:29:11.978]  She was running for re-election.
[03:29:12.098 --> 03:29:13.178]  All this stuff was happening.
[03:29:13.218 --> 03:29:25.622]  The economy was failing, inflation was going up, and there were massive corruption scandals and looting of an oil company that they had taken government control of, as all this was happening.
[03:29:25.802 --> 03:29:31.950]  She was down anywhere from six and a half to ten points in the polls just before the election, and then miraculously, she wins.
[03:29:32.511 --> 03:29:38.459]  Even though she was immediately, just prior to it, she was booed by a stadium of 60,000 fans, she wins.
[03:29:38.940 --> 03:29:41.683]  That's the danger of electronic elections.
[03:29:41.884 --> 03:29:43.145]  We can make it safe.
[03:29:43.846 --> 03:29:45.207]  We can make it very simple.
[03:29:45.247 --> 03:29:46.148]  We know how to do it.
[03:29:46.949 --> 03:29:47.830]  Use paper.
[03:29:48.210 --> 03:29:49.871]  Use human observers.
[03:29:50.392 --> 03:29:51.893]  Vote on the same day.
[03:29:52.273 --> 03:29:53.254]  Use photo IDs.
[03:29:53.294 --> 03:29:54.175]  But they don't want that.
[03:29:54.655 --> 03:29:56.917]  They want it complex so they can rig it.
[03:29:57.118 --> 03:29:57.498]  Stay with us.
[03:29:57.518 --> 03:29:58.118]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:59.840 --> 03:30:00.761]  We're on the march.
[03:30:01.241 --> 03:30:02.863]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.783 --> 03:30:06.446]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.839 --> 03:30:20.189]  The House Oversight Committee Chairman and the House Judiciary Committee Chairman are both raising the issue of whether Hillary Clinton committed perjury when she testified under oath to Congress.
[03:30:20.390 --> 03:30:26.717]  The discrepancies between what she said and what FBI Director Comey said are obvious even to the casual observer.
[03:30:26.977 --> 03:30:33.059]  But you may say, because the Justice Department is so politicized, they won't ever prosecute Hillary for crimes she commits.
[03:30:33.259 --> 03:30:33.799]  And you're right.
[03:30:34.019 --> 03:30:48.364]  But the president of Judicial Watch, which has been at the forefront of investigating the corruption and the national security violations of Hillary Clinton, points out in an interview with the Daily Mail, quote, one of the dirty little secrets in Washington is that Mrs. Clinton can be impeached now.
[03:30:48.684 --> 03:30:54.826]  A federal official leaving office does not end congressional jurisdiction over impeachment for misconduct in that office.
[03:30:55.166 --> 03:31:00.334]  And if Hillary was convicted by the Senate, the sanction could be indefinitely for future office.
[03:31:01.095 --> 03:31:03.378]  Will Congress grow a spine and check the corruption?
[03:31:03.699 --> 03:31:06.423]  If they don't do it in an election year, they won't ever.
[03:31:06.543 --> 03:31:08.346]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:31:10.640 --> 03:31:15.002]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[03:31:15.122 --> 03:31:26.046]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[03:31:26.206 --> 03:31:31.150]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[03:31:31.270 --> 03:31:33.772]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[03:31:33.832 --> 03:31:35.333]  It helps detoxify.
[03:31:35.553 --> 03:31:38.375]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[03:31:38.435 --> 03:31:43.179]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[03:31:43.219 --> 03:31:47.342]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[03:31:47.762 --> 03:31:49.424]  ...dependent upon selenium.
[03:31:49.464 --> 03:31:54.770]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[03:31:54.890 --> 03:31:56.331]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[03:31:56.511 --> 03:31:57.252]  This is so key.
[03:31:57.492 --> 03:32:01.797]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[03:32:01.837 --> 03:32:03.919]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.

[03:32:12.407 --> 03:32:13.708]  You can't survive without it.
[03:32:13.908 --> 03:32:14.809]  But where do you get it?
[03:32:15.109 --> 03:32:20.873]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:32:21.093 --> 03:32:26.817]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:32:26.997 --> 03:32:43.864]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:32:44.264 --> 03:32:46.386]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:32:46.746 --> 03:32:47.947]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:32:48.227 --> 03:32:48.928]  Easy assembly.
[03:32:49.248 --> 03:32:49.889]  Low maintenance.
[03:32:50.169 --> 03:32:51.991]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:33:23.524 --> 03:33:31.046]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:33:32.007 --> 03:33:35.908]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:36.368 --> 03:33:40.169]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:33:40.549 --> 03:33:42.090]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:43.130 --> 03:33:48.272]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this
[03:33:49.739 --> 03:33:56.722]  This Thursday, September 1st, 2016, it's been 272 days since Hillary Clinton has done a press conference.
[03:33:57.603 --> 03:34:03.846]  I think that's a big reason why she didn't go down and talk to the Mexican president, because she couldn't handle a press conference afterwards.
[03:34:03.966 --> 03:34:06.707]  But the press seems to be letting her get away with that.
[03:34:06.727 --> 03:34:10.649]  And we're going to get back to the news here, and I want to talk about SpaceX, because I think it tells us a great deal.
[03:34:11.289 --> 03:34:12.230]  About Hillary Clinton.
[03:34:12.610 --> 03:34:15.171]  I think it even tells us something about 9-11.
[03:34:15.591 --> 03:34:22.334]  And also Julian Assange, what he's talking about with the New York Times, I think tells us, gives us some insights about 9-11.
[03:34:22.574 --> 03:34:26.116]  We've had WND put out a story today talking about 9-11.
[03:34:26.796 --> 03:34:28.657]  So welcome, WND.
[03:34:28.977 --> 03:34:30.298]  I'm glad they're talking about that.
[03:34:30.338 --> 03:34:32.419]  They've talked about it before in the past.
[03:34:32.459 --> 03:34:33.860]  They took it on directly this time.
[03:34:33.880 --> 03:34:35.501]  So we're going to talk about that story as well coming up.
[03:34:35.901 --> 03:34:37.221]  Before we do, real quickly, we have 20% off.
[03:34:38.602 --> 03:34:44.605]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink at Infowarslife.com, a great way to support your health and to support our operation here.
[03:34:44.625 --> 03:34:48.146]  It's the affordable, great tasting Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink.
[03:34:48.327 --> 03:35:04.234]  It is a game-changing formula that helps you get a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body needs in a very tasteful, easy to assimilate, easy to take format that is just mixing that in with water or with
[03:35:04.834 --> 03:35:07.756]  Carbonated water, which is what I did this morning with mine, tasted great.
[03:35:07.896 --> 03:35:08.796]  My wife did that for me.
[03:35:09.236 --> 03:35:12.538]  Again, you can get that now 20% off at Infowarslife.com.
[03:35:12.898 --> 03:35:16.840]  That's your baseline multivitamin support right there in a drink mix.
[03:35:16.940 --> 03:35:21.582]  Also, we still have the Blackheart special at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:35:21.622 --> 03:35:23.983]  That's the Hillary for Prison t-shirt at cost.
[03:35:24.683 --> 03:35:27.585]  9.95.
[03:35:24.723 --> 03:35:27.585]  We've had so many people saying, hey, we want to help InfoWars.
[03:35:27.645 --> 03:35:29.086]  Alex has put a second link there.
[03:35:29.106 --> 03:35:34.810]  If you want to buy it at full price to help the organization, you can pay $20 for it, or you can get it at cost.
[03:35:35.430 --> 03:35:34.810]  9.95.
[03:35:35.570 --> 03:35:38.992]  Either way, we want you to get that information out there.
[03:35:39.493 --> 03:35:51.841]  If you want to help support the operation, we would really appreciate that, but we'll offer it to you for cost, because we are serious about Hillary Clinton needing to go to prison, not to the White House.
[03:35:52.406 --> 03:35:54.788]  Now, let's talk about what happened today with SpaceX.
[03:35:56.210 --> 03:36:01.175]  We had a rocket that was going to take up Facebook's newest internet satellite.
[03:36:01.876 --> 03:36:04.038]  It was a $200 million satellite.
[03:36:04.298 --> 03:36:06.320]  That's a lot of money, but think about it this way.
[03:36:07.101 --> 03:36:13.087]  If you're a Facebook executive, I want to talk to Mark Zuckerberg now and tell Mark it's not
[03:36:14.028 --> 03:36:14.669]  All that bad.
[03:36:14.809 --> 03:36:22.114]  That's less than half of what Obama sent in a pallet's load of cash to the Iranians, okay?
[03:36:22.154 --> 03:36:23.514]  He sent them 450 million.
[03:36:23.534 --> 03:36:29.178]  So this is only 200 million, Mark, and I'm sure that Obama can make it up to you because you guys are really good friends.
[03:36:29.218 --> 03:36:37.164]  Maybe, you know, he can find some more cash in a Swiss bank that he can put on a pallet and send to you to kind of cover those costs there if you're not insured.
[03:36:37.224 --> 03:36:41.346]  So 200 million dollars, but it's less than Obama sent to Iran, okay?
[03:36:41.687 --> 03:36:43.828]  And burned on that particular mission.
[03:36:44.529 --> 03:36:50.879]  A series of explosions sent smoke and flames shooting through the sky and shook buildings miles away.
[03:36:50.899 --> 03:36:56.447]  You know when I saw that I thought about what Hillary Clinton said earlier this week when she was talking about
[03:36:57.498 --> 03:37:05.560]  All of her corruption, her privileged immunity, you know, acting as if I guess she's got diplomatic immunity because she was Secretary of State.
[03:37:05.920 --> 03:37:07.981]  She can't be prosecuted no matter what she does.
[03:37:08.281 --> 03:37:11.002]  Or maybe that immunity comes from being a Clinton.
[03:37:11.082 --> 03:37:11.362]  I don't know.
[03:37:11.402 --> 03:37:14.583]  We're just the people that she knows, or what she knows about people.
[03:37:14.703 --> 03:37:15.263]  Maybe that's it.
[03:37:15.783 --> 03:37:17.826]  Maybe it's what Hillary knows about people.
[03:37:18.407 --> 03:37:28.420]  But when I looked at that and I thought about it, shocking buildings miles away, and I thought about how her corruption has sent shockwaves through our political system.
[03:37:29.375 --> 03:37:31.556]  And how it is destroying our political system.
[03:37:31.996 --> 03:37:33.077]  But also her remarks.
[03:37:33.137 --> 03:37:39.119]  Remember earlier this week, she said, you know, these emails, there's lots of smoke, but there's no fire.
[03:37:39.159 --> 03:37:40.380]  Now look at this picture.
[03:37:40.400 --> 03:37:42.881]  I tweeted this out earlier today.
[03:37:42.901 --> 03:37:44.882]  I tweeted out the picture, one of the pictures is up there.
[03:37:45.422 --> 03:37:46.963]  Yeah, there's a lot of smoke there.
[03:37:47.543 --> 03:37:48.904]  But you can also see there's fire.
[03:37:49.304 --> 03:37:51.605]  Because, you know, that's the metaphor, actually, Hillary.
[03:37:52.025 --> 03:37:53.066]  That's the true metaphor.
[03:37:53.266 --> 03:37:55.427]  You're trying to sell us a phony metaphor.
[03:37:55.947 --> 03:37:58.108]  Where there is smoke, there is fire.
[03:37:58.148 --> 03:38:06.392]  You can see that fire on the launching pad as the Facebook satellite and the rocket that it's on blow up, explode, and catch fire, okay?
[03:38:06.952 --> 03:38:11.356]  But now, as I put out, as I tweeted out, you know, Hillary said, well, there's lots of smoke but no fire.
[03:38:11.396 --> 03:38:11.977]  She looks at that.
[03:38:12.077 --> 03:38:18.963]  Brazil, Donna Brazil of the Democrat National Committee, she's now taken the place of Hillary's other friend, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[03:38:19.784 --> 03:38:22.006]  She says, no, no, no, I don't see any smoke.
[03:38:22.126 --> 03:38:27.170]  Because that's what she said earlier this week when she was on the talk shows and they were asking her about it.
[03:38:27.771 --> 03:38:31.494]  Even as they go, and I put that hashtag bleach bit there because
[03:38:32.415 --> 03:38:43.603]  You know, even as they're talking about the industrial software that you put in there, which doesn't just delete a file, but it overwrites your disk so that you can't recover the information.
[03:38:43.623 --> 03:38:48.427]  You know, the information is there, you can always reverse engineer that with some recovery software.
[03:38:48.447 --> 03:38:53.890]  They go back, they lose the directory, but they can, as long as the information is still on the disk, they can rebuild that, especially with a text file.
[03:38:54.331 --> 03:39:01.156]  So, they use something like BleachBit to actually overwrite the data on the disk so that it's not recoverable.
[03:39:01.656 --> 03:39:09.961]  The only good thing about this, I guess, is that the people in Africa have now been granted a reprieve from being dominated by Facebook.
[03:39:10.141 --> 03:39:12.102]  A temporary reprieve, at least.
[03:39:12.623 --> 03:39:13.683]  They're going to keep going with that.
[03:39:14.144 --> 03:39:18.286]  But let's talk about what Alex Jones brought up earlier, talking about Julian Assange.
[03:39:18.866 --> 03:39:20.888]  There's a New York Times article that came out.
[03:39:21.568 --> 03:39:26.152]  That is accusing WikiLeaks of being affiliated with Russian intelligence.
[03:39:26.512 --> 03:39:30.655]  And again, as we were saying, it is the charge that they're leveling at everybody.
[03:39:30.935 --> 03:39:35.419]  Anybody that is an enemy of theirs is part of Russian intelligence.
[03:39:35.479 --> 03:39:36.460]  And he had this to say.
[03:39:37.220 --> 03:39:38.101]  This is the RT story.
[03:39:38.121 --> 03:39:50.291]  It says, WikiLeaks has dismissed a wordy article by the New York Times suggesting that leaks by founder Julian Assange may have benefited Moscow or come from, quote, Russian intelligence, unquote.
[03:39:50.931 --> 03:39:54.572]  They said the claims are false and that they impute conspiracy.
[03:39:54.592 --> 03:39:56.492]  Now, this was done today.
[03:39:56.872 --> 03:39:57.913]  This article came out today.
[03:39:57.973 --> 03:40:02.534]  They claimed, quote, the agendas of WikiLeak and the Kremlin have often dovetailed.
[03:40:02.954 --> 03:40:09.095]  They also said the majority of Julian Assange's revelations had an anti-American, slightly pro-Russia bias.
[03:40:10.016 --> 03:40:19.838]  Without citing a reliable proof, the newspaper went on to speculate that Assange could have received Democrat Party documents leaked earlier this year from Russian intelligence.
[03:40:20.598 --> 03:40:35.070]  Now, Wicked Leaks replied and said the only hard news in this New York Times article is that, quote, American officials say Mr. Assange and Wicked Leaks probably had no direct ties to Russian intelligence services, unquote.
[03:40:35.371 --> 03:40:40.255]  And he points out that was said by James Clapper, head of U.S.
[03:40:40.355 --> 03:40:41.035]  intelligence.
[03:40:41.436 --> 03:40:42.236]  He stated the U.S.
[03:40:42.257 --> 03:40:44.879]  government has not been able to make any attribution.
[03:40:46.323 --> 03:41:07.746]  We've also had the former head of technical intelligence at the NSA, William Binney, come on our show and tell us that not only does he believe that the NSA has the information, if they want to get it, that they can put out there, but he says he has a reason to believe that there's a lot of people that work within the NSA that would be so angry at what Hillary Clinton would do and get away with it.
[03:41:08.246 --> 03:41:10.048]  Putting their lives in danger.
[03:41:10.088 --> 03:41:11.730]  Many people have lost their lives.
[03:41:11.810 --> 03:41:14.993]  Actually, Judge Napolitano said that as well.
[03:41:15.013 --> 03:41:20.639]  He said there's people in the intelligence community who have lost their lives over Hillary Clinton's leaks.
[03:41:21.741 --> 03:41:25.465]  And they're very concerned about what's going to happen with a President Hillary Clinton.
[03:41:26.317 --> 03:41:32.863]  All of their heads are basically in the chopping block, in the guillotine, if Hillary Clinton becomes president.
[03:41:33.223 --> 03:41:34.524]  So they're angry about what's happened.
[03:41:34.904 --> 03:41:40.089]  They're angry about how she has exposed people, how many of them believe she has already cost people their lives.
[03:41:40.609 --> 03:41:42.711]  And this is not, we're not talking about Arkansas here.
[03:41:42.731 --> 03:41:49.077]  We're talking about costing people their lives because you've leaked intelligence that exposes them in the field.
[03:41:50.054 --> 03:42:02.679]  And these 30 emails that they just found, that they've just turned up again, this is, you know, she used to say that Bill had these bimbo eruptions, and these people were not bimbos, okay?
[03:42:02.739 --> 03:42:05.100]  There were some bimbos, and that's what they wanted to focus on.
[03:42:05.140 --> 03:42:06.961]  That's what Ken Starr wanted to focus on.
[03:42:07.381 --> 03:42:13.244]  Ken Starr wanted to focus on the bimbos, not the people who were raped, who were sexually abused by Bill Clinton.
[03:42:13.784 --> 03:42:21.346]  Okay, he wanted to focus on the people that were having consensual sex with Bill Clinton, and that's the way they excused him.
[03:42:21.707 --> 03:42:24.187]  He turned that attention over there.
[03:42:24.207 --> 03:42:30.489]  And we've seen, after Ken Starr left as quote-unquote special prosecutor to Bill Clinton, what did he do?
[03:42:30.969 --> 03:42:38.712]  He wound up becoming a defender of Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein, the serial pedophile who was a friend of Bill Clinton.
[03:42:39.392 --> 03:42:41.393]  Ken Starr defended that man.
[03:42:41.793 --> 03:42:43.153]  Defended that man in court.
[03:42:43.813 --> 03:42:49.475]  And then Ken Starr at Baylor, no longer at Baylor, defended football players who were accused of rape.
[03:42:50.235 --> 03:42:56.616]  But what he did with Bill Clinton to defend him was basically to deflect attention to bimbos, not to victims.
[03:42:57.096 --> 03:42:57.316]  Okay?
[03:42:57.657 --> 03:43:00.677]  But Hillary Clinton has got her own eruptions.
[03:43:00.717 --> 03:43:07.059]  This continual trickle of things that are being released, emails that are showing their
[03:43:07.959 --> 03:43:17.149]  What they have done secretly, how they have set up pay-for-play, how they have played fast and loose and carelessly with national security issues.
[03:43:17.489 --> 03:43:24.797]  But then they go on in this article, they say, this is from WikiLeaks, a tweet from them, they say, no, Julian Assange did not say that Clinton is a demon.
[03:43:25.278 --> 03:43:26.219]  Actually, that would be us.
[03:43:26.519 --> 03:43:28.341]  Let's get the attribution right.
[03:43:29.922 --> 03:43:35.045]  He says, the demon is neo-McCarthyist hysteria that has been erected by the liberal press.
[03:43:35.085 --> 03:43:41.468]  Now, we did say she's a demon, and we will gladly accept that, because we really do believe that she is.
[03:43:41.749 --> 03:43:44.250]  And then they went on to say this, last thing I'll have to say about this.
[03:43:44.270 --> 03:43:50.213]  A WikiLeaks statement rejected the notion that WikiLeaks is a sympathizer to Moscow.
[03:43:50.233 --> 03:43:58.398]  They said, WikiLeaks has published more than 650,000 documents about Russia and about President Putin, most of which are critical.
[03:43:59.434 --> 03:44:05.516]  So the point of WikiLeaks is to expose secret, hidden agendas.
[03:44:06.337 --> 03:44:08.698]  Because secret, hidden agendas create corruption.
[03:44:09.438 --> 03:44:22.763]  They give people who are prone to be corrupted by power, and everybody is prone to be corrupted by power, but the worst people seem to be able to actually achieve their goal of getting the power.
[03:44:23.604 --> 03:44:24.104]  But it's that
[03:44:25.137 --> 03:44:33.311]  That corruption that comes with power that gets... It's like pouring gasoline on the fire when there is no transparency, when there is no oversight.
[03:44:34.306 --> 03:44:51.259]  And so the mission of WikiLeaks has been to expose this to make people who hate transparency, people like Barack Obama, people like George W. Bush, people especially like Hillary Clinton, to expose what they are doing in the dark to shine light on it.
[03:44:51.279 --> 03:44:52.800]  She talks about the dark corners of the Internet.
[03:44:53.100 --> 03:44:53.261]  No.
[03:44:53.681 --> 03:44:56.303]  She is doing the things in the dark.
[03:44:56.903 --> 03:45:00.246]  The Internet is the light that is shining on what Hillary Clinton is doing.
[03:45:01.391 --> 03:45:10.156]  And then as we talk about this conspiracy, you know, whether it is a conspiracy, now we have the New York Times openly engaging in conspiracy theories.
[03:45:10.216 --> 03:45:19.582]  And then I thought it was interesting to see this article today appear on WorldNetDaily, WND, talking about the government's other conspiracy theory.
[03:45:19.762 --> 03:45:21.343]  You know, the official 9-11 story.
[03:45:21.583 --> 03:45:24.384]  You know, the idea that two planes
[03:45:25.458 --> 03:45:30.020]  Caused three buildings to collapse in their footprint.
[03:45:30.540 --> 03:45:32.021]  Okay, just think about that for a moment.
[03:45:32.902 --> 03:45:45.448]  And along those lines, along the physical lines of that, of course there's a lot of different angles we can look at this and say, you know what, the government's official conspiracy theory about 9-11 cannot be true.
[03:45:46.148 --> 03:45:53.412]  Again, going back to Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, he says, when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable,
[03:45:54.332 --> 03:45:54.412]  Yes.
[03:46:14.807 --> 03:46:15.607]  Physics Magazine.
[03:46:15.627 --> 03:46:17.488]  This is Europhysics Magazine.
[03:46:17.548 --> 03:46:28.934]  Respective publication of the European physics community has published a report by four experts who say the evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that all three buildings were destroyed by controlled demolition.
[03:46:29.878 --> 03:46:33.220]  And that has far-reaching political implications.
[03:46:33.901 --> 03:46:37.723]  Because you'd have to prepare that in advance if you're going to have a demolition.
[03:46:37.923 --> 03:46:39.865]  Just like you have to prepare the solution.
[03:46:40.025 --> 03:46:52.153]  You know when you say that we've got evidence and the FBI comes out and says that we've got some evidence that a couple of states had some Russians snooping around in their election system.
[03:46:52.213 --> 03:46:53.474]  So I think we need to take it over.
[03:46:54.625 --> 03:47:02.210]  They are giving you a load of baloney just so they can sell you the solution that they already wanted to do, which is a government takeover.
[03:47:02.230 --> 03:47:03.751]  That's always what they want to sell.
[03:47:04.212 --> 03:47:15.640]  They say, given the far-reaching implications, it is morally imperative that this hypothesis be the subject of a truly scientific, impartial investigation by responsible authorities, said the four physicists.
[03:47:16.360 --> 03:47:20.241]  And then they point out in this article from WND that in August 2002, the U.S.
[03:47:20.762 --> 03:47:35.027]  National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, we've talked about this before as well, even NIST found that the three buildings were the only known cases of total structural collapse in high-rise buildings where fires played a significant role.
[03:47:36.027 --> 03:47:41.229]  Quote from NIST, the government's own scientific standards and technology organization.
[03:47:41.249 --> 03:47:48.932]  They say it bears repeating that fires have never caused the total collapse of a steel-framed high-rise before or since 9-11.
[03:47:48.952 --> 03:47:54.454]  Okay, did we witness an unprecedented event three separate times on September 11th?
[03:47:55.325 --> 03:47:55.525]  Yeah.
[03:47:56.266 --> 03:47:58.347]  Again, two planes, three buildings.
[03:47:58.407 --> 03:47:59.288]  Do the math, okay?
[03:47:59.648 --> 03:48:02.390]  And then they go on to talk about some of the other aspects of it.
[03:48:02.410 --> 03:48:04.712]  And I have to ask, you know, where are the lawsuits?
[03:48:04.832 --> 03:48:09.255]  We just had a lawsuit that was shut down out in Colorado.
[03:48:09.555 --> 03:48:16.280]  Every time there's a shooting, they try to come after the place where the shooting occurred, the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado.
[03:48:16.440 --> 03:48:23.102]  Or they go after gun manufacturers, even though there are laws that say you can't sue a gun manufacturer just because they make guns.
[03:48:23.682 --> 03:48:29.104]  That doesn't give them any liability, any criminal liability in that crime.
[03:48:29.504 --> 03:48:38.046]  Just like you can't sue Ford if you've got a jihadi using a Ford truck to run down people at a French beach, okay?
[03:48:38.566 --> 03:48:41.347]  The people who made that truck didn't do anything wrong.
[03:48:41.407 --> 03:48:44.268]  It was the person who was running people down that did something wrong.
[03:48:45.165 --> 03:48:50.589]  But where are the people suing the engineers and architects that built the World Trade Center?
[03:48:50.629 --> 03:48:58.794]  Why aren't they suing the building inspectors there in New York City who inspected that, who went over their design, who double-checked that?
[03:48:59.275 --> 03:49:00.796]  Why aren't they suing the people who built it?
[03:49:01.496 --> 03:49:02.257]  Interesting, isn't it?
[03:49:03.137 --> 03:49:04.698]  Now, I want to abruptly change this.
[03:49:04.758 --> 03:49:08.040]  I got a story just as we went to break that Kit Daniels gave to me.
[03:49:08.060 --> 03:49:09.682]  This is something we've talked about before.
[03:49:10.751 --> 03:49:24.257]  Gary Johnson loves to say that he's not against the Second Amendment, even though he chose William Weld, who is against the Second Amendment, and said, you know, I'm not going to run as a Libertarian candidate if I don't get William Weld as my VP.
[03:49:24.337 --> 03:49:25.558]  He was very adamant about that.
[03:49:25.998 --> 03:49:28.499]  And there was a lot of debate at the time within the party.
[03:49:28.519 --> 03:49:31.240]  So this guy's been against the Second Amendment from the get-go.
[03:49:31.700 --> 03:49:33.821]  And now the NRA is pointing that out.
[03:49:33.881 --> 03:49:35.982]  This is a story by Kit Daniels and InfoWars.com.
[03:49:36.002 --> 03:49:39.944]  The Libertarian Party is running an anti-gun candidate for Vice President.
[03:49:40.464 --> 03:49:41.005]  We're good to go.
[03:49:56.457 --> 03:50:01.959]  Weld recently confirmed his anti-gun stance and his ignorance on guns and general rights, Kit.
[03:50:01.979 --> 03:50:08.282]  He says, and this is a quote from William Weld in an interview just recently, in August.
[03:50:08.682 --> 03:50:13.204]  The five-shot rifle, says Weld, that's a standard military rifle.
[03:50:13.844 --> 03:50:20.347]  The problem is, if you attach a clip to it, so it can fire more shells, and if you remove the pins, it becomes an automatic weapon.
[03:50:21.047 --> 03:50:23.529]  And those are independent criminal offenses.
[03:50:23.569 --> 03:50:26.410]  That's when it becomes essentially a weapon of mass destruction.
[03:50:26.971 --> 03:50:27.951]  And he also attacked AR-15s.
[03:50:28.111 --> 03:50:29.752]  Well, let me tell you something, Weld.
[03:50:30.913 --> 03:50:35.275]  You should take a look at the flag that we have all over here in Texas.
[03:50:35.356 --> 03:50:36.756]  It's the come and take it flag.
[03:50:37.097 --> 03:50:38.097]  You know what's on that flag?
[03:50:38.117 --> 03:50:39.538]  It's not a musket.
[03:50:40.058 --> 03:50:40.839]  It's a cannon.
[03:50:41.439 --> 03:50:41.999]  It's a cannon.
[03:50:42.460 --> 03:50:47.142]  You know, when they went to get the arms at Concord and Lexington in Massachusetts, where you were governor.
[03:50:47.723 --> 03:50:49.204]  They went there to take the cannons.
[03:50:49.764 --> 03:50:51.265]  Not just the firearms.
[03:50:51.505 --> 03:50:55.829]  The Second Amendment is about the militia protecting our country, not a standing army.
[03:50:56.269 --> 03:51:02.594]  They were supposed to be military weapons to protect us from foreign and domestic enemies.
[03:51:02.634 --> 03:51:03.915]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:51:10.600 --> 03:51:16.744]  Let's talk about American, which is available at Infowarsstore.com exclusively right now for the next week or so.
[03:51:17.045 --> 03:51:19.506]  You get two copies and you get two free films with it.
[03:51:19.607 --> 03:51:22.148]  Yeah, this is an important movie because it's fact-based.
[03:51:23.049 --> 03:51:29.414]  We tell a story about an EMP attack, an electromagnetic pulse attack on America that shuts down the grid.
[03:51:29.974 --> 03:51:36.379]  And our Congress has warned that if this were to happen, 90% of the American population would die in 12 months.
[03:51:37.479 --> 03:51:42.143]  To quote Henry Kissinger, the only thing standing in the way of a new world order is a strong America.
[03:51:42.763 --> 03:51:50.689]  One of the ways that they can diminish America quickly and severely is to allow for an EMP attack on this country.
[03:51:51.229 --> 03:51:56.993]  And in light of the events and things that are happening, I'm afraid this is a very likely scenario.
[03:51:57.053 --> 03:51:58.074]  So I made a movie about it.
[03:51:58.334 --> 03:52:00.536]  It's an entertaining movie, but it's fact-based.
[03:52:01.076 --> 03:52:07.358]  People are getting the director's cut that is even bigger than what you see in theaters, and so this is the first look director's cut.
[03:52:07.378 --> 03:52:17.080]  You know, Hollywood has tried to diminish the final edit on this thing, but what Alex has available here at his website this week is everything.
[03:52:17.200 --> 03:52:18.180]  The most hardcore version.
[03:52:18.420 --> 03:52:18.560]  Yep.
[03:52:19.121 --> 03:52:24.982]  So this is a great place to acquire the movie and then to show it to your friends and family and even your churches.
[03:52:25.182 --> 03:52:46.618]  That's right, you can get one copy of the film Amerigeddon on DVD at Infowarsstore.com exclusively right now, or get a second copy, two copies for $39.90 and get my first film, America Destroyed by Design, and then one of my latest, most powerful films, Fall of the Republic, that breaks down everything currently happening, free.
[03:52:46.879 --> 03:52:52.183]  Two films free when you purchase two Amerigeddons, and I'm doing that because I want
[03:52:52.663 --> 03:52:54.224]  to get this film out.
[03:52:54.524 --> 03:53:02.109]  Another big thing people can do if you really want to reach a lot of people, get two copies, keep one for your own archive to share, take the other and donate it to the library.
[03:53:02.609 --> 03:53:06.191]  So many people are smart because they've closed all the video stores.
[03:53:06.211 --> 03:53:17.358]  I was reading an article about this in the Wall Street Journal about a year ago, that what's the most popular now at libraries is not the books anymore, but is people going and actually checking out the DVDs, the Blu-rays, all that.
[03:53:17.858 --> 03:53:20.660]  And so that's why you make a donation of this to your library,
[03:53:21.440 --> 03:53:26.302]  You're going to talk about hundreds of people that are going to check that out and watch it.
[03:53:27.782 --> 03:53:28.702]  That is amazing.
[03:53:29.083 --> 03:53:29.583]  All of that.
[03:53:29.643 --> 03:53:45.448]  I can't tell you how many listeners we run into on the street that found this show, not on a local AM or FM station, but over the internet over the years, that somebody gave them a DVD, or somebody gave them a card with ForbiddenInformationInfoWars.com, or they saw a bumper sticker, and it's just exponential.
[03:53:45.548 --> 03:53:46.128]  It's exponential.
[03:53:46.609 --> 03:53:50.530]  I can't imagine where InfoWars will be in a year, two years, three years.
[03:53:51.310 --> 03:53:55.711]  Uh, and I just pray to God that I can be humble and focused and make the right decisions with this great responsibility.
[03:53:55.751 --> 03:53:57.012]  But it's not just Alex Jones.
[03:53:57.312 --> 03:53:58.152]  It's what Gary Haven's doing.
[03:53:58.172 --> 03:53:59.072]  It's what Matt Drudge is doing.
[03:53:59.093 --> 03:54:00.153]  It's what WorldNetDaily is doing.
[03:54:00.193 --> 03:54:03.754]  It's what people like Donald Trump are doing.
[03:54:04.174 --> 03:54:07.555]  We all are just choosing to not be with the new world order.
[03:54:24.953 --> 03:54:32.759]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:32.779 --> 03:54:33.340]  I'm David Knight.
[03:54:33.360 --> 03:54:38.424]  We're going to talk about Donald Trump's Mexican summit because I think that's really what we ought to talk about.
[03:54:38.464 --> 03:54:40.645]  It's so much of a victory.
[03:54:40.685 --> 03:54:46.410]  We've got an article here from The Hill saying Trump has the ball and Hillary can't run out the clock.
[03:54:46.830 --> 03:54:51.134]  We're going to take a look at what Donald Trump's critics said about what happened yesterday.
[03:54:51.434 --> 03:54:57.156]  But before we do, real quickly, just want to let you know that our initial supply of bio-true selenium is running low.
[03:54:57.196 --> 03:54:58.977]  You'll find that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:54:58.997 --> 03:55:05.879]  Again, this is our initial run of a new selenium that we are selling at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:55:05.899 --> 03:55:07.439]  This is from a 100% organic source.
[03:55:09.600 --> 03:55:11.142]  So 100% organic mustard seed.
[03:55:11.162 --> 03:55:12.083]  They press it out of that.
[03:55:12.123 --> 03:55:22.495]  So not only do you not get some trace heavy metals that you might get in some mineral formulations of selenium, it's not synthetic, it is organic, and it doesn't have any of these heavy metals.
[03:55:22.555 --> 03:55:29.422]  As a matter of fact, when they press it out of the organic mustard seed, you actually get some good things out of that as well.
[03:55:30.123 --> 03:55:36.528]  But again, it's something that is very important for your health, and that's a new formulation that we have at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:55:36.969 --> 03:55:40.672]  Also, we have 20% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix.
[03:55:40.692 --> 03:55:43.614]  That's at InfoWarsLife.com, while supplies last.
[03:55:43.654 --> 03:55:44.675]  So take advantage of that.
[03:55:45.196 --> 03:55:48.919]  And the Hillary for Prison T-shirt, part of our Black Heart Special.
[03:55:48.939 --> 03:55:50.160]  You can get that at cost.
[03:55:50.640 --> 03:55:52.981]  At InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:53.001 --> 03:55:52.981]  $9.95.
[03:55:53.061 --> 03:55:53.801]  That's our cost.
[03:55:54.201 --> 03:56:03.565]  If you want to help our organization, we have another little box down there that Alex has added so you can pay full cost if you would like to help us to support our operation here.
[03:56:03.605 --> 03:56:08.407]  But we're going to put that out there at cost for people because we want to get that message out.
[03:56:08.467 --> 03:56:10.888]  Again, your Hillary for Prison t-shirt at cost.
[03:56:11.168 --> 03:56:14.069]  Part of our Black Heart Special at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:56:14.629 --> 03:56:17.510]  Let's talk real quickly in the time we've got left about Trump's Mexican summit.
[03:56:17.790 --> 03:56:18.871]  This is the Washington Post.
[03:56:19.591 --> 03:56:20.776]  No friend to Donald Trump.
[03:56:21.177 --> 03:56:23.426]  They say Donald Trump went to Mexico and won.
[03:56:24.232 --> 03:56:24.532]  Okay?
[03:56:25.273 --> 03:56:27.394]  Hillary was the loser in this, folks.
[03:56:27.414 --> 03:56:28.315]  That's not their subtitle.
[03:56:28.815 --> 03:56:36.400]  But they say, after weeks of scrutiny, actually after weeks of attack by this same organization, The Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, etc.
[03:56:36.880 --> 03:56:41.924]  But after weeks of that, Trump needed to restore some sense of legitimacy and strength to his flailing campaign.
[03:56:41.984 --> 03:56:49.509]  Yeah, I don't think it was flailing, but anyway, what better way to do this than to stand statesman-like next to the President of Mexico?
[03:56:50.189 --> 03:56:53.592]  Trump, says The Washington Post, played the role to perfection.
[03:56:54.312 --> 03:56:57.874]  Subdued, even solemn, he owned the proceedings.
[03:56:58.434 --> 03:57:01.416]  Trump chose when and how he wanted to visit Mexico.
[03:57:01.736 --> 03:57:03.217]  He established the meeting's agenda.
[03:57:03.437 --> 03:57:08.140]  He laid out a five-point plan for a bilateral relationship and a potential Trump presidency.
[03:57:08.440 --> 03:57:14.863]  He even chose who got to ask the questions during the brief news conference that followed the usual statements.
[03:57:14.883 --> 03:57:17.145]  Because, you know, he's had a lot of practice doing this.
[03:57:17.805 --> 03:57:19.766]  He's had 16 press conferences.
[03:57:20.086 --> 03:57:22.808]  Hillary has had zero press conferences.
[03:57:23.459 --> 03:57:28.906]  And they go on to say, he deftly placed himself on equal footing with the President of Mexico.
[03:57:28.926 --> 03:57:38.619]  A master of optics, Trump used the setting to his advantage, calling Pena, Pena Neto, I don't know how to pronounce his name, sorry folks, I'm not Spanish.
[03:57:39.659 --> 03:57:42.660]  A master of optics, he used the setting to his advantage.
[03:57:42.681 --> 03:57:43.821]  He called him a friend.
[03:57:44.101 --> 03:57:47.602]  He conveniently shook his hand for front page ready photos.
[03:57:47.642 --> 03:57:56.666]  He avoided anything resembling an apology, and albeit in more careful terms than before, he stood by the construction of a border barrier.
[03:57:56.966 --> 03:57:57.246]  Okay?
[03:57:57.446 --> 03:58:00.448]  Meanwhile, even NPR says Trump makes nice in Mexico.
[03:58:00.748 --> 03:58:03.389]  He struck his most presidential pose to date.
[03:58:03.829 --> 03:58:05.970]  And then you got The Hill pointing out that
[03:58:06.946 --> 03:58:09.248]  Everybody was saying, he can't come back from this deficit.
[03:58:09.288 --> 03:58:13.793]  You know, his former campaign manager Manafort said, you know, we were never planning to win in August.
[03:58:14.313 --> 03:58:16.936]  We're planning to win in November.
[03:58:17.877 --> 03:58:23.322]  And even William Crystal says, it's hard when you're a challenger to seem presidential.
[03:58:23.423 --> 03:58:27.286]  Trump standing there for all the awkwardness looks presidential.
[03:58:27.727 --> 03:58:28.808]  A good day for Trump.
[03:58:28.928 --> 03:58:35.513]  And Hillary's former communication director said if you believe Trump needed to pivot, moderate, look more presidential, the event was a home run.

[03:58:39.737 --> 03:58:52.027]  Eastern.
[03:58:52.047 --> 03:58:55.410]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:59:00.572 --> 03:59:09.921]  The House Oversight Committee Chairman and the House Judiciary Committee Chairman are both raising the issue of whether Hillary Clinton committed perjury when she testified under oath to Congress.
[03:59:10.121 --> 03:59:16.447]  The discrepancies between what she said and what FBI Director Comey said are obvious even to the casual observer.
[03:59:16.707 --> 03:59:22.792]  But you may say, because the Justice Department is so politicized, they won't ever prosecute Hillary for crimes she commits.
[03:59:22.992 --> 03:59:23.552]  And you're right.
[03:59:23.752 --> 03:59:31.578]  But the president of Judicial Watch, which has been at the forefront of investigating the corruption and the national security violations of Hillary Clinton, points out in an interview
