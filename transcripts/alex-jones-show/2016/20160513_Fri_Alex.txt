[00:00:05.123 --> 00:00:07.625]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday the 13th, 2016.
[00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:15.371]  This is a live global transmission on this Friday edition.
[00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:23.056]  We are going to absolutely cover the waterfront and expose the globalist program for total world domination.
[00:00:23.617 --> 00:00:31.263]  Yesterday I got into articles in The Hill and other publications dealing with the plan to take over the suburbs and rural areas and make them unlivable.
[00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:36.486]  Let's go to a John Bowne special report, then we'll come back and break this and a lot more down.
[00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:48.674]  Community organizing, Supreme Commander President Barack Obama hates America so much that even as a lame duck president, he intends on taking one last cheap shot
[00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:51.335]  At the success of the American Dream.
[00:00:51.636 --> 00:01:08.125]  Obama and Julian Castro, Obama's Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in some kind of ongoing, lightly reported, bizarre Social Agenda 21 experiment, aimed to punish the suburbs of America for all of the hard work that fueled their position in life.
[00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:10.246]  Ours is a nation like no other.
[00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:14.267]  A place where great journeys can be made in a single generation.
[00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:19.409]  No matter who you are or where you come from, the path is always forward.
[00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:24.991]  The New York Post writes, Hillary's rumored running mate, Housing Secretary Julian Castro
[00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:32.380]  Westchester is cooking up a scheme to reallocate funding for Section 8 housing to punish suburbs for being too white and too wealthy.
[00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:40.691]  The scheme involves supersizing vouchers to help urban poor afford higher rents in pricey areas such as Westchester County.
[00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:47.958]  While assigning them government real estate agents called mobility counselors to secure housing in the exurbs.
[00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:59.869]  Julian Castro, who the left is seeing as their Obama 2.0 and Hillary's VP, was handpicked by the Obama administration in 2014 from his position as mayor of San Antonio, Texas.
[00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:16.228]  To oversee Obama's social experimentation on the housing of America, Castro was highly criticized for the sale of thousands of foreclosed homes to Wall Street firms at bargain basement prices using HUD's Distressed Assets Stabilization Program.
[00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.591]  98% of those homes were sold to Wall Street.
[00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:35.986]  Castro had been brought in to assist Obama's 2013 forced diversity HUD ruling, where Agenda 21 would receive a tremendous steroid shot, resulting in, as Stanley Kurtz, author of Spreading the Wealth, How Obama is Robbing the Suburbs to Pay for the City's Rights,
[00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:39.808]  The new HUD rule is really about changing the way Americans live.
[00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:48.292]  It is part of a broader suite of initiatives designed to block suburban development, press Americans into hyper-dense cities, and force us out of our cars.
[00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:57.337]  Government-mandated ethnic and racial diversification plays a role in this scheme, yet the broader goal is forced economic integration.
[00:02:57.597 --> 00:03:08.100]  The ultimate vision is to make all neighborhoods more or less alike, turning traditional cities into ultra-dense Manhattans, while making suburbs look more like cities do now.
[00:03:08.401 --> 00:03:21.005]  In this centrally planned utopia, steadily increasing numbers will live cheek-by-jowl and stack-and-pack high-rises close to public transportation, while automobiles fall into relative disuse.
[00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:21.985]  The Hill reports.
[00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:24.166]  In June 2015, the U.S.
[00:03:24.186 --> 00:03:40.354]  Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that federal housing laws allows people to challenge zoning laws and other housing practices that have a disparate or harmful impact on minority groups, even if there is no proof that the discrimination was intentional.
[00:03:40.594 --> 00:03:49.118]  And two weeks after that Supreme Court ruling, HUD issued a regulation intended to help poor people move into communities that are rich with opportunity.
[00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:52.419]  As HUD Secretary Castro phrased it at the time.
[00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:59.162]  And now, a settlement agreement with Baltimore County, Maryland is making those fanatically utopian policies come to fruition.
[00:03:59.342 --> 00:04:08.765]  Due to a complaint filed with HUD in 2011 by the NAACP, 1,000 units will now be dispersed in the most affluent areas of Baltimore.
[00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:16.948]  And if that wasn't enough to fundamentally alter the American landscape, Castro threatened to sue suburban landlords for discrimination
[00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:26.095]  What do you think about considering Julian Castro as vice president?
[00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:32.720]  Well, I think really highly of him and I am thrilled to have his endorsement today.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.505]  Both he and his brother, the congressman, are just among the best young leaders in America.
[00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:43.948]  Castro's sucking up to Wall Street was seen as a potential toxic addition to
[00:04:43.988 --> 00:05:02.476]  Hillary's campaign but now with this dangerous scheme to once again bring government leeching welfare recipients and criminals in the left-wing perception of two white white flight quiet suburbs of America in the name of fighting inequality has the potential of placing the American dream squarely over the
[00:05:02.956 --> 00:05:05.897]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:05:06.197 --> 00:05:15.778]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[00:05:16.078 --> 00:05:21.259]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:30.221]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:39.090]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.237]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigyrex herbal processing technique.
[00:05:46.377 --> 00:05:51.683]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you with the best
[00:05:52.903 --> 00:06:05.367]  We could have saved Navy SEALs in Benghazi.
[00:06:05.527 --> 00:06:09.369]  F-16 pilots in Italy were on standby to help besiege U.S.
[00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:12.710]  forces in Libya, but the order to launch never came.
[00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:13.450]  A U.S.
[00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:19.152]  Air Force source has claimed that a squadron of attack jets was being armed and fueled on the night of the deadly attack.
[00:06:19.352 --> 00:06:30.438]  On the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, the jets, believed to be F-16s, were on the runway ready to launch as terrorists bombarded the U.S.
[00:06:30.498 --> 00:06:32.900]  consulate, killing four Americans.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:44.927]  The source claims the fighters could have launched from Aviano Air Force Base in northern Italy and refueled at Naval Air Station Sigonella before providing air support over Benghazi.
[00:06:45.127 --> 00:06:48.149]  And yet, all we hear is Hillary Clinton saying,
[00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:50.730]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:56.434]  She is the most vile, un-American human being to ever live.
[00:06:56.574 --> 00:06:58.996]  She is pure evil in the flesh.
[00:06:59.276 --> 00:07:01.938]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:03.539]  Brain force is here.
[00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:06.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:14.426]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of brain force.
[00:07:15.205 --> 00:07:18.388]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:07:18.648 --> 00:07:18.788]  Right?
[00:07:18.808 --> 00:07:21.150]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.013]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:07:25.073 --> 00:07:28.216]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:33.500]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.882]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:07:36.242 --> 00:07:40.666]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:42.827]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:07:43.448 --> 00:07:44.909]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:45.309]  Exactly.
[00:07:45.329 --> 00:07:49.133]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:57.641]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:08:13.946 --> 00:08:16.928]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:17.528 --> 00:08:21.751]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.994 --> 00:08:28.195]  It is Friday the 13th, 2016.
[00:08:29.416 --> 00:08:37.862]  On this May 13th broadcast, I'll be here live for the next three hours.
[00:08:40.009 --> 00:09:06.614]  And then I will also do about 30 minutes into the fourth hour of overdrive because we have the director of 13 hours, which I've now had a chance to see and which I've only laud because it exposes the fact that Hillary and the State Department ordered a stand down in Benghazi.
[00:09:08.579 --> 00:09:11.760]  And the director said, this is not a political film.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.361]  We just covered what the facts showed.
[00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:16.703]  And that's a big deal to see something like that come out of Hollywood.
[00:09:17.543 --> 00:09:23.526]  So I look forward to interviewing the director coming up in 30 minutes in the fourth hour.
[00:09:27.247 --> 00:09:31.309]  We're also going to have Mark Meacham on from the UK, from Scotland.
[00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.712]  He was arrested, even though he's a liberal socialist in his own words.
[00:09:40.236 --> 00:09:43.257]  For putting out Hitler Dog.
[00:09:45.237 --> 00:09:48.578]  His YouTube account is Count Dracula, where he makes joke videos.
[00:09:50.419 --> 00:09:51.499]  About villains and things.
[00:09:52.619 --> 00:09:55.360]  And of course, Sean Cleese did a lot of Hitler skits as well.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.400]  So did Charlie Chaplin.
[00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:57.601]  And others.
[00:09:57.981 --> 00:10:02.962]  This just shows that even if someone is saying Heil Hitler, don't they have the right to do it?
[00:10:02.982 --> 00:10:04.663]  I mean, if you love Hitler, isn't that your right?
[00:10:04.683 --> 00:10:06.243]  But you don't like Hitler?
[00:10:06.563 --> 00:10:07.904]  And you make a comedy video?
[00:10:07.984 --> 00:10:08.804]  And you get arrested?
[00:10:11.738 --> 00:10:12.379]  He's joining us.
[00:10:15.341 --> 00:10:24.188]  Les Jamieson, who heads up the website hr14.org, highly recommended by Congressman Walter Jones and others.
[00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:39.120]  Les Jamieson is working hard to try to get the 28 pages on 9-11 released, so he'll be popping in on the transmission as well today.
[00:10:42.244 --> 00:10:45.806]  There's some really unintentional comedy we're going to be going over.
[00:10:47.087 --> 00:10:49.209]  It's the press releases put out today.
[00:10:49.229 --> 00:10:51.410]  The Associated Press is reporting on it.
[00:10:52.771 --> 00:11:09.523]  That Facebook is conducting an internal investigation to find out if there's any censorship of conservatives going on or curtailing or governing, ratcheting back, suppression, blockage.
[00:11:12.754 --> 00:11:23.938]  Zuckerberg is on record with Merkel on a stage saying he's blocking, quote, anti-immigrant criticisms in Germany of the huge Islamic invasion.
[00:11:25.119 --> 00:11:30.881]  He's on record meeting with the Communist Chinese over and over again the last few years with their censorship heads on how to do it.
[00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:33.522]  I mean, we played the clips of him meeting with them.
[00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:35.062]  We played the clip of him with Merkel.
[00:11:35.302 --> 00:11:36.583]  It's all on Infowars.com.
[00:11:38.457 --> 00:11:43.279]  We have internal memos that Facebook didn't even hide where they talked about blocking Donald Trump.
[00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:44.479]  I mean, this is going on.
[00:11:44.499 --> 00:11:53.663]  And they've had mainstream media the last few months as this bubbled under the surface have articles going, look, you own your company, you're allowed to block views you don't like.
[00:11:54.003 --> 00:11:58.645]  Yes, but you advertise that as long as someone isn't calling for violence or whatever,
[00:12:00.842 --> 00:12:02.884]  Or selling stolen goods, or whatever the case may be.
[00:12:03.604 --> 00:12:04.745]  Or having pornography.
[00:12:05.366 --> 00:12:13.892]  That you are allowed, no matter whether you're a Muslim, a Christian, a Hindu, an Atheist, a Conservative, a Libertarian, an agnostic political person, whatever.
[00:12:15.314 --> 00:12:19.697]  You're allowed to have your views, and you're allowed to put out memes, and you're allowed to post videos.
[00:12:19.937 --> 00:12:20.738]  They're your videos.
[00:12:23.203 --> 00:12:25.264]  So they tried to sell the idea of censorship.
[00:12:25.364 --> 00:12:26.624]  It's blowing up in their face.
[00:12:26.664 --> 00:12:29.925]  And I just want to say great job to our listeners who were really at the heart of promoting this.
[00:12:30.345 --> 00:12:33.946]  Great job to DrudgeReport.com and Matt Drudge really making this front and center.
[00:12:34.706 --> 00:12:38.667]  Great job to the Facebook employees and contractors that have gone public.
[00:12:40.348 --> 00:12:44.669]  And great job to my crew for persevering and just really hammering Facebook.
[00:12:46.957 --> 00:12:55.324]  And I've had some folks through Facebook reach out to us and just say, you know, you might want to just leave us alone and we'll let your stuff get spread virally.
[00:12:55.744 --> 00:12:59.467]  And then all of a sudden, all our stuff just starts going viral everywhere.
[00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:05.212]  And then I don't stop criticizing the censorship that's going on for other people.
[00:13:05.432 --> 00:13:06.913]  And then boom, we get turned off again.
[00:13:09.756 --> 00:13:10.316]  I mean, as if.
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.064]  If I get left alone, I'm going to let everybody else get censored.
[00:13:14.324 --> 00:13:15.546]  That's not how I operate.
[00:13:16.047 --> 00:13:19.932]  And it wasn't like, hey, buddy, do this and we'll leave you alone.
[00:13:19.952 --> 00:13:22.055]  It was like, you might want to stop what you're doing.
[00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:26.641]  And if you want to keep getting spread virally and, you know, Facebook's being real nice to you and wants to work with you.
[00:13:28.052 --> 00:13:35.475]  We've had YouTube do it, you know, where the vice president calls up and all these doors open and then I criticize Google and the doors close.
[00:13:36.596 --> 00:13:43.578]  I mean, like I'm a donkey and there's a stick tied on a pole out in front of my head and I'm out here plowing the fields.
[00:13:44.479 --> 00:13:47.720]  I bring value to Google, to YouTube, to Facebook, to Twitter.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.181]  I bring content
[00:13:50.302 --> 00:13:52.727]  And $30 million of investment a year.
[00:13:52.767 --> 00:13:54.309]  That's how much it costs to run InfoWars.
[00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:55.291]  Sounds like a lot.
[00:13:55.371 --> 00:13:55.752]  It's not.
[00:13:56.213 --> 00:13:57.856]  Medium-sized papers cost more than that.
[00:13:58.176 --> 00:13:58.937]  I do it on the cheap.
[00:14:00.103 --> 00:14:12.688]  I go out and, you know, raise money other ways, or some family property gets sold and I put it into InfoWars, or I get a big, you know, movie deal and, you know, get a payday on something as a consultant and I put it right back in.
[00:14:12.748 --> 00:14:13.949]  And it's not bad to make money.
[00:14:14.489 --> 00:14:26.694]  It's that my passion is opposing the New World Order, exposing baby parts being sold, exposing dehumanization, because I don't like dehumanization because I'm a human and I take it personal because I have empathy.
[00:14:30.041 --> 00:14:41.153]  I can't even barely do the show today, but I'm going to do it because Rob is one of my best friends, news director, plays basketball, really healthy guy, and he was out last night with some of the guys after work at about 7.
[00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:44.497]  He said, man, my whole side feels kind of weird and numb.
[00:14:44.657 --> 00:14:45.298]  I'm going to go home.
[00:14:45.558 --> 00:14:48.081]  This whole left side, that's usually your brain or your heart.
[00:14:51.004 --> 00:14:54.047]  All we have is a text message from his wife this morning saying, hey, he's not going to be in.
[00:14:54.548 --> 00:14:58.812]  I think he left his phone up there, you know, quote, it's really bad, the worst ever.
[00:14:59.233 --> 00:15:04.518]  So I've sent Buckley to his house or wherever to try to get a hold of him so I can give you an update.
[00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:06.521]  But I'm really pissed off right now.
[00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:08.443]  So I'm going to try to control myself because
[00:15:11.997 --> 00:15:15.299]  I care about my friends, I care about my family, and I care about the general public as well.
[00:15:15.739 --> 00:15:22.423]  So many people in the general public, when I treat them with respect, or I'm nice to them, or I try to build people up, they think it's because I'm weak.
[00:15:23.144 --> 00:15:25.185]  Because see, they wouldn't try to build me up or you up.
[00:15:28.227 --> 00:15:31.309]  They wouldn't try to help somebody, so they think you're the same way.
[00:15:31.329 --> 00:15:33.170]  It's just, it's bizarre.
[00:15:34.574 --> 00:15:47.039]  And Texas has its share of corruption historically and problems, but it's well known that if you run into good Texans, you know, your handshake's as good as it gets and people are really into being straight and strong and honorable and building a real society.
[00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:59.184]  And I always heard that growing up and was cynical about it and said, oh, Texans aren't special and I'm sick of all this Texas worship and, you know, oh great, my ancestors were the key founders of the state from the very beginning on both sides of the family.
[00:16:00.124 --> 00:16:01.907]  And I would just, you know, kind of get tired of hearing about it.
[00:16:02.407 --> 00:16:11.119]  But once I grew up and learned about the rest of the world, the rest of the country, and rediscovered all these great Texans I grew up around, I had a blind spot.
[00:16:11.259 --> 00:16:17.528]  I thought everybody was like my grandparents and my great-grandparents and my family members and my cousins and everybody.
[00:16:25.225 --> 00:16:26.386]  And I'm not a sardonic person.
[00:16:26.406 --> 00:16:27.347]  I'm not an arrogant person.
[00:16:27.387 --> 00:16:28.268]  I'm not on a power trip.
[00:16:29.009 --> 00:16:38.018]  It scares me to think that I'm stronger, smarter, tougher, meaner, more honorable than almost anybody I've ever run into or met.
[00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:40.060]  That's a scary thing.
[00:16:42.182 --> 00:16:48.649]  And when I do find honorable people like Rob do, those kind of people become your family.
[00:16:51.681 --> 00:17:03.186]  And that's why I hate the globalists, the things they do to innocent children, the things they do to our women, the things they do to our culture, the way they're attacking us, the way they're trying to destroy our civilization.
[00:17:04.027 --> 00:17:04.607]  I'm tired of it.
[00:17:05.628 --> 00:17:12.531]  And half the time I get mad and blow up and explode on air because I'm frustrated with myself that I'm not doing a good enough job to attack these people!
[00:17:13.325 --> 00:17:22.413]  And I put my full will and my full soul on the line and ask God to give me the strength because I've got the courage to bring these people down!
[00:17:22.433 --> 00:17:29.119]  And it's not out of hatred or rage I want to do that, it's out of love of humanity.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.302]  All you haters out there, I know you're going to hate.
[00:17:33.447 --> 00:17:37.769]  I know you're gonna backstab, I know you're gonna creep around, but I got news for you.
[00:17:37.809 --> 00:17:38.869]  Your time's coming.
[00:17:39.489 --> 00:17:43.251]  Sooner or later, to quote Johnny Cash, God's gonna cut you down.
[00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:47.612]  Excuse me, let's get back to Zuckerberg.
[00:17:48.653 --> 00:17:54.455]  Zuckerberg lauds socialism with China's internet censorship czar.
[00:17:56.007 --> 00:17:58.688]  Facebook CEO visit with Lou Wee.
[00:17:59.308 --> 00:18:00.469]  Hypocritical and absurd.
[00:18:00.489 --> 00:18:03.250]  Remember that one back in December of 2014?
[00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.331]  There's a whole bunch of other ones.
[00:18:06.831 --> 00:18:12.053]  Mark Zuckerberg caught on hot mic saying Facebook will censor anti-migrant posts.
[00:18:15.295 --> 00:18:18.756]  Ex-Stasi agent hired to censor xenophobic Facebook posts.
[00:18:19.296 --> 00:18:22.558]  She then calls the police who come and arrest you or interrogate you or fine you.
[00:18:23.798 --> 00:18:25.499]  Oh, that's the big liberal state of Germany.
[00:18:27.054 --> 00:18:30.975]  Oh, by the way, German women don't wear miniskirts and we can't have Oktoberfest outdoors.
[00:18:31.436 --> 00:18:46.901]  I didn't even get to two articles yesterday in France and Germany where Muslim gangs on TV, this is on film, are going around beating people up and demanding protection money as a Sharia tax at outdoor bars.
[00:18:47.761 --> 00:18:50.322]  I mean, people walk to me and I'm in an outdoor bar with a glass of wine.
[00:18:50.582 --> 00:18:51.902]  You try to attack me?
[00:18:52.042 --> 00:18:56.184]  I am going to, I mean, what in Hades is going on here?
[00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:02.377]  I just, we are such a broke-back, wussified culture.
[00:19:04.438 --> 00:19:05.818]  And I for one have had enough of it.
[00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:14.481]  But here's the deal, these Muslims, these poor Muslims, and I say poor, I mean, they come from poor areas in the Middle East, all henpeck and oppress each other, that's all they know.
[00:19:15.161 --> 00:19:22.544]  They come from the most just backwards, oppressive, cult-like, moron garbage.
[00:19:23.044 --> 00:19:26.885]  And they come to our free, open society and just absolutely run amok all over it.
[00:19:28.072 --> 00:19:30.934]  And we're so open and free, we quote, won't discriminate.
[00:19:30.974 --> 00:19:33.295]  Listen, you don't eat rotten meat, do you?
[00:19:33.335 --> 00:19:34.176]  That's discrimination.
[00:19:34.476 --> 00:19:36.017]  You don't wear clothes with big holes in them.
[00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:37.558]  You discriminate against holes in them.
[00:19:39.499 --> 00:19:40.960]  They've misapplied definitions.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:46.643]  You shouldn't be mean to somebody just because of what color their skin is.
[00:19:46.663 --> 00:19:50.746]  But if they are attacking you with a ball-peen hammer or a knife, you've got to fight back.
[00:19:51.877 --> 00:19:53.799]  And I read the articles yesterday all over France.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.041]  Highways shut down.
[00:19:55.381 --> 00:19:57.023]  Huge hordes robbing the vehicles.
[00:19:57.103 --> 00:19:58.205]  It's just all over Europe.
[00:19:59.106 --> 00:20:01.929]  France announced civil emergency as they just descend.
[00:20:06.975 --> 00:20:08.277]  Comedy is now illegal.
[00:20:08.637 --> 00:20:10.199]  Charlie Chaplin made fun of Hitler.
[00:20:10.299 --> 00:20:11.220]  I've made fun of Hitler.
[00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:15.780]  Remember, Jesse James made fun of Hitler and they said, oh, you're a Nazi.
[00:20:16.561 --> 00:20:18.281]  This is an assault on reality.
[00:20:19.022 --> 00:20:35.568]  How dare people tell Americans and Scots and folks that died in mass fighting Hitler, our grandparents, that we're with Hitler if some liberal trendy who's apologized and turns out he's a liberal, of course he apologized, should apologize and say, I didn't do anything, it's satire, it's protected.
[00:20:35.708 --> 00:20:37.889]  But by him groveling, they keep charging him.
[00:20:39.069 --> 00:20:41.210]  He should say, how dare you, and get a jury trial.
[00:20:42.418 --> 00:20:43.399]  This is happening everywhere.
[00:20:44.059 --> 00:20:45.420]  We'll put the headline back up on screen.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.341]  I want to put it on Facebook.
[00:20:46.601 --> 00:20:47.242]  I want to retweet it.
[00:20:47.522 --> 00:20:51.285]  Police now arresting YouTubers for offensive videos.
[00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:53.426]  No speech is safe, folks.
[00:20:53.967 --> 00:20:55.007]  I've got a stack of news.
[00:20:55.808 --> 00:21:00.391]  A teacher in Germany, a teacher in Austria, there's two different stories today, one in Germany, one in Austria.
[00:21:00.672 --> 00:21:08.898]  A teacher in Austria talked about the Quran, talking about Muhammad saying you can have sex with 12-year-olds, and said that's pedophilia, and she's been arrested.
[00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:18.694]  Now folks, separately China's been caught shipping in little girls for sex slaves and they're calling it sex slavery.
[00:21:19.635 --> 00:21:27.839]  It is what it is, but this, even if it wasn't true that Mohammed said that, wrote that, you should have a right to say it!
[00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:28.919]  This is tyranny!
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.561]  Let's go ahead and go to this incredible report by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:41.214]  28-year-old Marcus Meacham was arrested for hate crimes after posting this joke video of his girlfriend's dog reacting to Nazi slogans.
[00:21:41.435 --> 00:21:47.179]  My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:54.065]  And so I thought I would turn them into the least cute thing that I could think of, which is a Nazi.
[00:21:55.866 --> 00:21:57.988]  Buddha, do I gas the Jews?
[00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:01.551]  Gas the Jews?
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:03.840]  Cheers.
[00:22:03.861 --> 00:22:04.362]  See you guys!
[00:22:04.402 --> 00:22:04.783]  Cheers.
[00:22:20.054 --> 00:22:25.458]  The video went viral, receiving 18,000 thumbs up to just 1,200 thumbs down.
[00:22:25.539 --> 00:22:35.907]  The vast majority of viewers thought that it was hilarious, but thanks to a small minority of perpetually offended retards, Meacham got a home visit from the Scottish police.
[00:22:36.167 --> 00:22:44.434]  Authorities said that Meacham's arrest is a lesson to others that any video content deemed offensive will not be tolerated.
[00:22:44.574 --> 00:22:51.259]  Meechan then prostrated himself, pleading that he wasn't a racist and that he only made the video to annoy his girlfriend.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:56.223]  Isn't it interesting that John Cleese recently came out and decried political correctness?
[00:22:56.364 --> 00:23:02.468]  Because under that definition, Cleese himself would have been arrested for this Fawlty Towers sketch.
[00:23:02.589 --> 00:23:03.249]  Who's this then?
[00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.391]  Stark human!
[00:23:05.611 --> 00:23:09.454]  I'm in the funny world!
[00:23:09.514 --> 00:23:10.035]  Keep going!
[00:23:14.114 --> 00:23:18.298]  Charlie Chaplin would have been thrown in a jail cell for the same reason.
[00:23:18.378 --> 00:23:26.085]  If they're now treating any video content whatsoever that causes offense as hate speech, then my entire channel is hate speech.
[00:23:26.425 --> 00:23:29.608]  We make jokes about it, but the fact is they're coming after everybody's free speech.
[00:23:30.189 --> 00:23:31.550]  Use free speech or lose it.
[00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.112]  Defend it or they'll take it.

[00:23:50.852 --> 00:23:54.336]  You are the Paul Revere's fighting this modern totalitarian takeover.
[00:24:13.721 --> 00:24:16.222]  All right, Rob Dew, our news director, is okay.
[00:24:16.763 --> 00:24:21.925]  I just couldn't get a hold of his wife for like an hour when I got into the office this morning and learned about this.
[00:24:22.525 --> 00:24:24.987]  She texted Darren McBreen saying he wouldn't be in.
[00:24:25.007 --> 00:24:26.687]  He was as sick as she'd ever seen him.
[00:24:26.707 --> 00:24:27.608]  And then I said, well, what happened?
[00:24:28.068 --> 00:24:32.130]  Well, last night after the show, they were at a restaurant having a couple beers.
[00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:35.912]  And he said, man, I feel all numb on my left side and I feel terrible.
[00:24:35.932 --> 00:24:36.572]  I'm going to go home.
[00:24:36.612 --> 00:24:37.433]  And then we get a text.
[00:24:37.513 --> 00:24:38.213]  It's the worst ever.
[00:24:38.233 --> 00:24:39.534]  I'm thinking, is that his heart, his brain?
[00:24:39.994 --> 00:24:41.775]  Maybe it's a pinched nerve.
[00:24:42.635 --> 00:24:45.657]  And his wife says it seems to be really, really bad flu or something.
[00:24:48.099 --> 00:24:51.481]  But he's okay, so I don't mean to put off a false alarm here.
[00:24:51.501 --> 00:24:59.186]  I was just sharing with you that I was upset with the clock ticking until Buckley got over to his house to find out exactly what was going on.
[00:24:59.226 --> 00:25:02.669]  But that did happen, so now I'm good.
[00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:05.951]  It's the suspense of it, as everybody knows, with family or good friends.
[00:25:07.592 --> 00:25:10.214]  Especially the older you get, you see so many friends and family die.
[00:25:11.308 --> 00:25:13.288]  You see so many healthy people just drop dead.
[00:25:13.408 --> 00:25:18.590]  You just see so many people you love get an infection when they go in for surgery and the day later they're dead.
[00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.490]  And, or maybe a lot of folks haven't experienced that.
[00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:27.031]  I've had friends die with their hand in my hand and watch the light go out of their eyes.
[00:25:28.332 --> 00:25:31.132]  And it just, there is too much death in this world.
[00:25:31.932 --> 00:25:34.633]  But you know, it's the great equalizer.
[00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:42.544]  And it's what brings great men and great women and common men and women, all of us down to the same equalized level.
[00:25:43.344 --> 00:25:48.946]  Now, let's get into just a smattering of the news that's coming up.
[00:25:48.966 --> 00:25:49.787]  I really need to do this.
[00:25:51.227 --> 00:25:59.670]  There's one Telegraph article about where is the world's new billionaire luxury home hotspot?
[00:26:01.011 --> 00:26:03.512]  And of course, it's New Zealand.
[00:26:05.011 --> 00:26:07.632]  But in these articles, they don't tell you why they're all running there.
[00:26:08.093 --> 00:26:13.736]  In many others, they admit it's because of global crisis, global war, global meltdown.
[00:26:13.776 --> 00:26:14.636]  That's what they're saying.
[00:26:14.756 --> 00:26:15.857]  I'm not the one saying that.
[00:26:16.317 --> 00:26:17.438]  The elites are saying it.
[00:26:17.818 --> 00:26:19.219]  Pentagon reports are saying it.
[00:26:19.739 --> 00:26:22.040]  British Ministry of Defense reports are saying it.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.522]  We're watching it very, very closely.
[00:26:28.324 --> 00:26:30.805]  And we see retail numbers across the world just plummeting.
[00:26:30.965 --> 00:26:33.487]  Production, raw material production plummeting.
[00:26:34.727 --> 00:26:37.249]  A lot of very, very, very, very serious signs.
[00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:44.576]  We're also going to get into this big report when we come back in the next long segment that's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:26:46.298 --> 00:26:53.044]  WTFTSA viral video, that's what the guy says, viral video shows unbelievable length
[00:26:54.457 --> 00:26:58.180]  Of security lines, some people waiting up to four hours.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.541]  Now, you talk about being held hostage.
[00:27:01.182 --> 00:27:03.083]  TSA funding only goes up and up and up.
[00:27:03.103 --> 00:27:06.686]  They've spent tens of billions every few years on naked body scanners.
[00:27:10.404 --> 00:27:14.205]  They've got checkpoints on highways and at random bus stations and train stations.
[00:27:15.085 --> 00:27:23.908]  But the borders are open, and we have mainstream news articles admitting that they fly in planes to New York every day, out of Mexico and other countries, and no one is even checked.
[00:27:24.308 --> 00:27:25.888]  No IDs are even looked at.
[00:27:25.908 --> 00:27:28.809]  In fact, we can probably put those articles up on screen.
[00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:31.210]  But for TV viewers, we're showing you this giant line.
[00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.012]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:27:36.792 --> 00:27:40.835]  And then now at airports all over, they're just losing giant amounts of luggage.
[00:27:41.336 --> 00:27:44.878]  And then the TSA just so happened to already be scheduled to be testifying yesterday.
[00:27:44.898 --> 00:27:51.363]  And there's the head of the Transportation Safety Administration, the nanny state.
[00:27:52.452 --> 00:27:57.434]  And they say, I saw it on Fox News this morning, the director goes, I told you a few months ago we need more money.
[00:27:58.235 --> 00:28:00.176]  And we need more money to get these lines going.
[00:28:00.236 --> 00:28:01.096]  Well, guess what?
[00:28:02.017 --> 00:28:11.941]  Magically, they're now going to get more money that'll then be siphoned off in naked body scanners from people like Michael Chertoff, former head of Homeland Security.
[00:28:13.302 --> 00:28:17.424]  Congress approves TSA requests for screeners to meet Summer Crush.
[00:28:19.701 --> 00:28:27.865]  They're going to get an additional $34 million to hire an additional 768 new officers and pay overtime for $42,000 plus.
[00:28:29.386 --> 00:28:30.206]  Oh, isn't that great?
[00:28:31.207 --> 00:28:44.433]  So you can all learn how to go through a checkpoint, be checked, be searched, but the Border Patrol completes the smuggling process of tens of thousands a month of quote, other than Mexicans from the Middle East, China, you name it.
[00:28:45.814 --> 00:28:47.355]  ISIS is on the border, coming across.
[00:28:48.075 --> 00:28:50.356]  Planes flying from Europe, the Middle East, Mexico.
[00:28:50.396 --> 00:28:51.177]  Don't even get searched.
[00:28:51.577 --> 00:28:56.359]  From Austin, Texas, to Los Angeles, California, to New York, New York.
[00:28:56.439 --> 00:28:57.200]  It's in the news.
[00:28:59.021 --> 00:28:59.861]  Whistleblowers go.
[00:28:59.901 --> 00:29:01.822]  No, we're ordered to not even check their IDs.
[00:29:01.842 --> 00:29:02.442]  We just let them in.
[00:29:02.883 --> 00:29:04.243]  Donald Trump goes, this is outrageous.
[00:29:04.283 --> 00:29:06.324]  The FBI says we're not vetting any of these people.
[00:29:06.604 --> 00:29:07.845]  Most of the passports are fake.
[00:29:08.385 --> 00:29:09.806]  We're not even checking some of those.
[00:29:09.826 --> 00:29:13.548]  We need to shut this off until they start checking again.
[00:29:14.605 --> 00:29:20.130]  And their answer is to say that, quote, he wants to ban a religion or arrest all the Muslims and all these lies.
[00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:29.219]  We're going to play some of those clips coming up, but that shows the total fraud.
[00:29:29.539 --> 00:29:33.924]  Give us more funding or we'll make you wait four or five hours or we'll lose your luggage.
[00:29:35.145 --> 00:29:40.228]  And then you watch, no matter how much we pay, more and more funding to fund their next rollout.
[00:29:40.248 --> 00:29:45.452]  Because most of the funding, this is a diversion, is for highway checkpoints, mobile vans, x-ray vans.
[00:29:45.812 --> 00:29:48.373]  But the border's open, but you'll have internal checkpoints.
[00:29:48.654 --> 00:29:49.394]  That's globalism.
[00:29:49.774 --> 00:29:50.855]  A police state, but no border.
[00:29:51.856 --> 00:29:52.756]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.236 --> 00:29:54.837]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.778 --> 00:29:58.460]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.432 --> 00:30:03.874]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:30:04.354 --> 00:30:10.280]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:30:10.521 --> 00:30:24.675]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[00:30:25.256 --> 00:30:27.177]  To focusing on fighting the globalists.
[00:30:27.577 --> 00:30:35.402]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:30:35.623 --> 00:30:42.747]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:30:43.027 --> 00:30:48.771]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.

[00:32:03.277 --> 00:32:08.259]  Caitlyn Jenner experienced sex change regret, might de-transition, biographer says.
[00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:10.079]  It hasn't been easy for Caitlyn.
[00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:11.220]  It's been very hard.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.982]  Ian Halperin recalls one source telling him, well, you are a dude dressed like a lady.
[00:32:17.242 --> 00:32:18.422]  Dude looks like a lady!
[00:32:19.223 --> 00:32:24.667]  Caitlyn Jenner, who announced her transition from man to woman last year, has considered de-transitioning.
[00:32:24.847 --> 00:32:28.990]  The author of a new book about the Kardashian family told The Wrap on Wednesday.
[00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:40.999]  Ian Halperin, the author of Kardashian Dynasty, the controversial rise of America's royal family, thanks to all you crazy leftists who want to ban freedom, have made these kind of people celebrities.
[00:32:41.139 --> 00:32:41.699]  Thank you.
[00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:45.602]  One source confirmed to me Caitlyn has made whispers of sex change regret.
[00:32:45.822 --> 00:32:47.243]  You didn't even change sex!
[00:32:47.303 --> 00:32:49.484]  You're a guy with a dress on!
[00:32:49.624 --> 00:32:51.125]  Get with the program, dude!
[00:32:51.145 --> 00:32:52.205]  You're delusional!
[00:32:52.406 --> 00:32:53.486]  Put on some shorts!
[00:32:53.666 --> 00:32:56.448]  Get a tank top, eat some Wheaties, and go for a jog!
[00:32:56.568 --> 00:32:58.289]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com
[00:33:07.136 --> 00:33:10.639]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.022]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:14.002 --> 00:33:17.085]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:33:17.706 --> 00:33:20.048]  Run on for a long time.
[00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:22.771]  Run on for a long time.
[00:33:29.493 --> 00:33:34.354]  We are working on getting the director 13 hours on, and I think that's going to be next week or so.
[00:33:34.754 --> 00:33:35.474]  I get confused.
[00:33:35.694 --> 00:33:48.117]  We actually have one of the heroes of Benghazi joining us that wrote the book that was turned into 13 pages, and that's Chris Paranto, Army Ranger, served all the world.
[00:33:48.157 --> 00:33:50.578]  Then he was in a CIA annex security team.
[00:33:51.518 --> 00:33:53.179]  That basically refused the stand-down order.
[00:33:53.219 --> 00:34:00.802]  They were on the sat phones and over and over again were told stand down by the CIA orders from the State Department.
[00:34:01.323 --> 00:34:02.443]  Now this had always been known.
[00:34:02.463 --> 00:34:04.464]  I had Colonel Schaefer on the week after it happened.
[00:34:04.484 --> 00:34:09.106]  He got in a lot of trouble for telling the truth and coming on the show, but he had the courage to do it.
[00:34:10.567 --> 00:34:16.770]  Just like he exposed the stand-down orders to not kill Bin Laden in 2001 with Stratis IV and Able Danger.
[00:34:18.021 --> 00:34:20.223]  And we had other sources as well that broke this down.
[00:34:20.543 --> 00:34:22.004]  They wanted the people there dead.
[00:34:22.384 --> 00:34:24.205]  They wanted to say that Al-Qaeda had done it.
[00:34:24.225 --> 00:34:30.970]  It was really the security team that the State Department had hired to run security, general security in Benghazi.
[00:34:31.951 --> 00:34:36.694]  It was ISIS, it was Al-Qaeda, it was Wahhabist, before they ever changed their name to ISIS.
[00:34:37.234 --> 00:34:39.295]  And they wanted the three warehouses full of weapons.
[00:34:39.316 --> 00:34:42.758]  So they went over, thought they'd kill people in a few minutes, but
[00:34:44.278 --> 00:34:58.066]  The stand-down went for 13 hours, the firefight for eight and a half, because a few teams of men, Navy SEALs and Rangers, assigned to CIA contractors, refused to stand down, refused to watch fellow Americans get killed.
[00:34:59.026 --> 00:35:00.507]  And so we know now what happened.
[00:35:00.927 --> 00:35:12.294]  So don't forget, one of the good things that Megyn Kelly's done a few months ago on Fox News, was have some of these gentlemen on, and here is a clip of what they had to say, this is coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:35:13.442 --> 00:35:21.186]  The CIA station chief, where you were at the time, told you repeatedly, according to the movie, stand down.
[00:35:21.226 --> 00:35:22.167]  We saw that in the trailer.
[00:35:22.187 --> 00:35:24.128]  He used the words, stand down.
[00:35:24.148 --> 00:35:25.348]  Is that how you remember it?
[00:35:25.969 --> 00:35:28.290]  Yeah, I mean, it was him.
[00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:30.671]  It was the chief of base, the deputy chief, and our team leader.
[00:35:30.691 --> 00:35:33.353]  They were sitting on the front porch when he told me to stand down.
[00:35:34.313 --> 00:35:36.755]  It was, Tig said, Ray, we're losing the initiative.
[00:35:37.275 --> 00:35:37.755]  And we were.
[00:35:38.075 --> 00:35:38.776]  Why is it wrong?
[00:35:38.896 --> 00:35:39.036]  Why?
[00:35:41.557 --> 00:35:43.038]  You're here to protect the annex.
[00:35:43.138 --> 00:35:55.547]  They have some security personnel over at the consulate, which our viewers should know, congressional investigators have already found was woefully inadequate and that we were totally unprepared, that state had totally left those guys unprepared to defend themselves.
[00:35:55.607 --> 00:36:01.751]  But, in the moment, that station chief at the annex is saying to you, stand down, you're here to protect us, this facility, not that one.
[00:36:02.131 --> 00:36:05.595]  Well, I really don't think it was just for us to protect that facility.
[00:36:05.615 --> 00:36:06.917]  Yeah, she's whitewashing there.
[00:36:08.098 --> 00:36:11.182]  There's multiple security situations when we should have left and he never let us go.
[00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:12.463]  She's trying to change the subject, too.
[00:36:12.744 --> 00:36:14.366]  I was just risk adverse, in my opinion.
[00:36:14.386 --> 00:36:18.250]  This last station, he wanted his legacy to be what it was.
[00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:19.452]  He didn't want to lose anybody, I guess.
[00:36:19.992 --> 00:36:21.814]  You got trained Army Rangers.
[00:36:21.974 --> 00:36:24.177]  Full clips up on InfoWars.com obviously.
[00:36:24.397 --> 00:36:27.320]  But the man in the middle is going to be joining us today to talk about his book that was turned into the film.
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.882]  We're also working to get the director on.
[00:36:28.962 --> 00:36:30.023]  I thought we were getting both of them together.
[00:36:30.044 --> 00:36:30.965]  That's why I was confused earlier.
[00:36:31.906 --> 00:36:34.529]  But it's just incredible.
[00:36:35.851 --> 00:36:36.051]  This is
[00:36:51.092 --> 00:37:06.530]  The order to stand down over and over and over again when we now have a culture filled with men, especially, who will violate their oaths, who will in a cowardly fashion turn their back on their fellow Americans and humans and follow illegal orders.
[00:37:07.692 --> 00:37:08.913]  But Benghazi went too far.
[00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:18.912]  And people like Colonel Schaefer and others are also heroes, because he came on a week after it laid out what happened, and man, they called him in, I'm not supposed to get into it, and basically threatened him.
[00:37:19.592 --> 00:37:22.253]  And I'm not going to say what they threatened him with, but you can probably imagine.
[00:37:22.713 --> 00:37:23.934]  He still comes on the show.
[00:37:25.235 --> 00:37:25.615]  And you know what?
[00:37:25.695 --> 00:37:26.475]  He made it through that.
[00:37:27.376 --> 00:37:33.499]  Just like Tosh Plumlee was retiring from the CIA after almost 50 years, right after Benghazi.
[00:37:34.946 --> 00:37:45.469]  Confirm with NATO sources, Pentagon sources that were there, that they're shipping guns to Al-Qaeda, and high-impact weapons, tow missiles, anti-aircraft, MPADs, you name it.
[00:37:46.029 --> 00:37:49.950]  Not just in Benghazi, but directly to them, and that he wouldn't be part of it and others wouldn't.
[00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:56.632]  They called up and said, we're going to indict you, we're going to kill you, did disinformation operations against him.
[00:37:57.668 --> 00:38:01.971]  Had people calling him up, saying they were with me, that we didn't like him.
[00:38:02.211 --> 00:38:04.373]  Just all sorts of dirty tricks to cause infighting.
[00:38:04.553 --> 00:38:05.033]  Didn't work.
[00:38:05.974 --> 00:38:08.355]  And obviously, we are willing to cover these issues as well.
[00:38:09.936 --> 00:38:13.098]  Because if we don't, there's no future.
[00:38:13.178 --> 00:38:16.381]  If we let them get away with stuff like this, folks, there's no limit.
[00:38:17.761 --> 00:38:19.963]  The great danger is cowering to these people.
[00:38:21.144 --> 00:38:24.226]  And it's my instinct that I cannot lay down to this.
[00:38:26.287 --> 00:38:27.308]  Quite frankly, I don't have any fear.
[00:38:29.932 --> 00:38:32.356]  It's almost like I'm a slave to the truth.
[00:38:32.536 --> 00:38:33.437]  It's a good feeling though.
[00:38:33.638 --> 00:38:35.340]  I just, I do the right thing.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:36.142]  It's default.
[00:38:37.423 --> 00:38:40.789]  And I just don't see how other people don't do the right things in their lives.
[00:38:42.912 --> 00:38:47.276]  The people think it's cool to sell out to corruption and to betray people, and you know what?
[00:38:47.316 --> 00:38:48.977]  Those are soft, evil folks.
[00:38:49.778 --> 00:38:55.263]  You don't really ever find anybody that's really lived and really been involved in anything who continues to be corrupt.
[00:38:55.523 --> 00:38:58.646]  I see a lot of punks that are corrupt, but they go through some real adversity.
[00:38:58.666 --> 00:38:59.546]  They tend to become men.
[00:39:00.567 --> 00:39:02.989]  That's why they want this nanny state, this artificial society.
[00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:07.814]  I've got an article here where three Navy SEALs in training, before they were SEALs, have recently died.
[00:39:09.395 --> 00:39:16.660]  One in training, another flipping their truck, another committed suicide, and they go, oh, should we, you know, cut back on the training and make it easier?
[00:39:19.522 --> 00:39:22.204]  And if anything, they have made it a little bit easier, but not much.
[00:39:24.566 --> 00:39:27.208]  And the answer is, that's why you go through training like this.
[00:39:27.608 --> 00:39:28.849]  People always die.
[00:39:30.154 --> 00:39:36.737]  I mean, quite frankly, you go back 50, 60 years ago with Marine Corps training, there were just deaths every week at Camp Lejeune.
[00:39:37.218 --> 00:39:38.078]  That's what happens.
[00:39:39.059 --> 00:39:45.782]  I've talked to family, I've got the Army, Marines, you name it, and it was just, it was expected people were going to die.
[00:39:46.603 --> 00:39:53.246]  You're getting ready to go into situations where even more people are going to die, and a whole bunch more are going to die if they don't find out who's going to crack.
[00:39:54.527 --> 00:39:55.027]  It's that simple.
[00:39:56.462 --> 00:40:00.726]  So they have to bring you right up to battlefield situations over and over again.
[00:40:01.086 --> 00:40:04.530]  And if you bring somebody into a battlefield situation, somebody's going to get shot.
[00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:06.071]  Somebody's going to get blown up.
[00:40:06.131 --> 00:40:07.552]  Somebody's going to fall out of the helicopter.
[00:40:07.773 --> 00:40:08.934]  Somebody's going to break their neck.
[00:40:09.234 --> 00:40:10.655]  That's what men do.
[00:40:11.937 --> 00:40:13.038]  But not in the nanny state.
[00:40:14.419 --> 00:40:15.640]  You got to ban dodgeball.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.081]  Now they want to ban football.
[00:40:17.362 --> 00:40:18.563]  Now they want to restrict everything.
[00:40:18.603 --> 00:40:20.625]  Now everybody in bull riding's got to wear a helmet.
[00:40:24.741 --> 00:40:26.805]  Yeah, people say, well, let's see you bull ride.
[00:40:27.226 --> 00:40:28.188]  I'm not bull riding.
[00:40:28.769 --> 00:40:29.491]  Though I've attempted it.
[00:40:29.912 --> 00:40:34.401]  The point is that that's the sport.
[00:40:34.501 --> 00:40:35.823]  It's macho for a reason.
[00:40:38.581 --> 00:41:00.442]  They admit GPS, just being in our cars a decade or so, suddenly the average human doesn't have any depth perception or a situational awareness that just think back ten years ago, you kind of knew where the sun was, different directions, hills, where you were in a city, you kind of just had an idea of where that next street would be because you had a little map in your hand or you wrote down some notes, just like calculators are making us stupid.
[00:41:01.923 --> 00:41:08.925]  Just like now, automatic, you know, systems are basically guessing the word on my iPhone when I've half written it.
[00:41:09.205 --> 00:41:10.145]  Forget a spell checker.
[00:41:11.186 --> 00:41:14.046]  It's now writing the word for me, guessing what the word is.
[00:41:14.286 --> 00:41:24.449]  And if I want to send a cuss word, which I occasionally send, or maybe a quote, or someone else's text that has a cuss word, it will change it.
[00:41:24.609 --> 00:41:25.510]  It's a nanny state.
[00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:26.510]  It's an AI.
[00:41:27.577 --> 00:41:40.673]  Can every yardstick, every meter, every gauge we've got, every indices, shows we're getting stupider and stupider and weaker and weaker and weaker.
[00:41:41.294 --> 00:41:43.357]  You know, used to, I was talking to Buckley about this last night,
[00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:54.882]  You had your quote dark side, not an evil side, but a primal side where you had to go out and get the food and maybe fight other humans that were trying to take your food and you could get really vicious and really mean.
[00:41:54.902 --> 00:42:01.186]  Then you went back to the hut or back to the cave and you got the little baby with your wife and everybody loved each other.
[00:42:03.048 --> 00:42:07.871]  That was the precious side that, you know, where you wanted to be by the fire with your people.
[00:42:11.203 --> 00:42:16.608]  But now it's all a fake nanny state where we all act nice and act like we're liberal and act like we love each other.
[00:42:16.628 --> 00:42:21.172]  And then at home we go and watch TV all day.
[00:42:21.212 --> 00:42:22.333]  We don't cuddle with each other.
[00:42:25.737 --> 00:42:26.277]  We're fake.
[00:42:27.979 --> 00:42:34.285]  And yes, there are new studies out in psychology today that are publications that show humans now have a shorter attention span than a goldfish.
[00:42:37.867 --> 00:42:41.932]  Humans have shorter attention span than a goldfish, thanks to smartphones, the London Telegraph, science.
[00:42:42.592 --> 00:42:47.798]  And I'm telling you folks, I talk to adults everywhere, executives, really smart people.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.143]  And folks call a high IQ smart, that's only one gauge.
[00:42:52.163 --> 00:42:53.305]  How about cultural smarts?
[00:42:53.925 --> 00:42:57.169]  How about semantical IQ?
[00:42:57.209 --> 00:42:57.550]  How about
[00:42:59.096 --> 00:43:00.317]  An oratory IQ.
[00:43:00.717 --> 00:43:03.079]  What about your social abilities?
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.981]  People don't have that more and more.
[00:43:05.621 --> 00:43:06.262]  They're selfish.
[00:43:06.282 --> 00:43:06.862]  They're stunted.
[00:43:06.882 --> 00:43:07.623]  They're unconscious.
[00:43:09.064 --> 00:43:10.004]  They're bored.
[00:43:10.084 --> 00:43:11.285]  Record numbers are bored.
[00:43:11.485 --> 00:43:12.746]  And the brain matter is dying.
[00:43:12.927 --> 00:43:21.973]  When you're excited learning new things, even as you get old and lose overall brain mass tissue, you expand new systems in the brain.
[00:43:22.995 --> 00:43:25.376]  New neural pathways have actually become more intelligent.
[00:43:25.656 --> 00:43:32.557]  They've done many autopsies on top composers, top mathematicians, and the brain might be a third smaller than when the person was, say, 20 years old.
[00:43:33.637 --> 00:43:34.078]  Shriveled.
[00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:34.598]  Tiny.
[00:43:36.398 --> 00:43:43.080]  But that person was doing mathematical equations at 90 years old, bouncing off the walls with a 25-year-old girlfriend.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.881]  Till the day they had a heart attack, and that's a more famous case.
[00:43:48.281 --> 00:43:48.901]  The point is,
[00:43:51.104 --> 00:44:00.017]  When you let somebody else live for you, and you just sit there and watch all day, and you don't take action, and you don't get involved, just like muscles atrophy, the mind atrophies.
[00:44:01.377 --> 00:44:03.518]  And I know I'm telling you something you already know.
[00:44:03.838 --> 00:44:05.618]  I'm telling myself something I already know.
[00:44:05.978 --> 00:44:10.560]  I am only going to be involved in TV and media if it's empowering.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:15.121]  And if it is encouraging people to go outside into nature and to be part of the universe.
[00:44:15.461 --> 00:44:19.443]  Near my house, there is a creek and there are thousands of fireflies now.
[00:44:19.483 --> 00:44:20.263]  They're kind of peaking.
[00:44:20.703 --> 00:44:23.204]  And I need to go out there with a time-lapse and show it.
[00:44:24.764 --> 00:44:25.965]  People say, well, how is that news?
[00:44:26.145 --> 00:44:30.046]  Well, I'm going to discuss while I'm out there and I'm going to do a voiceover about
[00:44:31.291 --> 00:44:42.795]  You know, really experiencing the world, and if you want to counter globalist disinformation and globalist brainwashing and globalist ugly media and ugly art meant to sabotage your soul, that's declassified.
[00:44:43.115 --> 00:44:58.181]  The CIA wants to hurt you, make you dumb, make you confused so they can rule you, show you ugly art, show you mental illness, show you not just short attention span shows for kids, but twist it where none of it makes sense and is basically mentally ill to turn you into a gibbering moron.
[00:44:59.358 --> 00:45:06.105]  And I say CIA, that's a gestalt, touchstone, big agency that admittedly has been involved in it, but it's far beyond that.
[00:45:06.145 --> 00:45:19.418]  It's the big university think tank combines, the DARPAs, the different Skinnerian Institutes, the Pavlovian juggernauts, the Tavistock Institutes.
[00:45:21.974 --> 00:45:27.443]  Everything you see is their weapons forged against you and your family, and they write white papers admitting it.
[00:45:27.964 --> 00:45:31.610]  And the people running those facilities are just committed!
[00:45:32.912 --> 00:45:43.881]  They're savaging you and your family and they have a wicked hatred of the average person and believe that you are unfit, profane and stunted and they're just hurrying your acceleration into oblivion.
[00:45:44.101 --> 00:45:49.165]  And I've talked to some of these people off record and they go, listen here, that horde will tear you apart in a moment.
[00:45:49.625 --> 00:45:55.510]  The mere fact that we've been public about it and they do nothing shows they deserve what's being done to them.
[00:45:58.532 --> 00:46:00.974]  And I've countered back, boy, I bet you got some screwed up kids.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.585]  And they'll say stuff like, yeah, two of them are screwed up, one of them's good.
[00:46:08.207 --> 00:46:09.349]  That's just how nature works.
[00:46:10.606 --> 00:46:12.327]  And I say, I think you're a cold-blooded bastard.
[00:46:13.148 --> 00:46:15.849]  Alex, you know that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
[00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:16.430]  You know that.
[00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:19.212]  So why do you sit there and defend these people?
[00:46:19.452 --> 00:46:30.139]  And I say, because it's not fair to put them in front of a TV from birth and give them formula that's two-thirds high-fructose corn syrup so their brain is all fried, and you never let them get off the starting line.
[00:46:30.379 --> 00:46:35.082]  That is an attack on a species, not even your eugenics-based accelerate the species.
[00:46:35.423 --> 00:46:39.986]  I see you decelerating the species, and I say you're a greedy son of a... You know what?
[00:46:40.966 --> 00:46:41.767]  Son of the devil!
[00:46:45.832 --> 00:46:47.034]  And it's the standard speech.
[00:46:47.094 --> 00:46:48.335]  Look, you know, you're smart.
[00:46:48.436 --> 00:46:49.056]  You see it.
[00:46:49.116 --> 00:46:50.178]  That means you should join us.
[00:46:50.438 --> 00:46:52.260]  Try to reform it from within, Alex!
[00:46:53.899 --> 00:47:01.581]  There's some bad people in the elite, but that's because good people aren't working with a... And that's all a cover.
[00:47:02.201 --> 00:47:12.523]  Like Emperor Palpatine, to use a child's analogy, telling Anakin Skywalker he's gonna help him and he loves him and he's gonna teach him something really loving and helpful and good.
[00:47:14.023 --> 00:47:16.184]  But it's not good, is it?
[00:47:21.665 --> 00:47:21.805]  No.
[00:47:24.744 --> 00:47:27.505]  And the establishment tells us, well, that's your perspective, your point of view.
[00:47:28.386 --> 00:47:30.086]  Everything's relative, isn't it?
[00:47:30.466 --> 00:47:32.247]  Things are relative to a point.
[00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:40.130]  All right, and I've got just so much news here.
[00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:41.571]  I've absolutely got to cover the election news.
[00:47:41.611 --> 00:47:42.351]  It's all over the top.
[00:47:43.292 --> 00:47:48.614]  A man busted for video threatening Trump family says he thought it'd make him look cool.
[00:47:49.554 --> 00:47:50.675]  We're going to play some of that video.
[00:47:52.261 --> 00:47:54.486]  Remember he said, I'm going to kill Trump, I'm going to kill his family.
[00:47:54.726 --> 00:47:56.409]  He said that before the news says I said that.
[00:47:56.429 --> 00:47:56.910]  I was quoting him.
[00:47:57.171 --> 00:47:57.993]  That's how deceptive they are.
[00:47:58.013 --> 00:47:59.937]  They'll actually run with stuff like that and clip it out of context.
[00:48:00.297 --> 00:48:02.321]  And media matters and CNN and the rest of them.
[00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:09.871]  And see, it's all about a fake rite of passage where you get up there and, you know, announce what you're gonna do and you're this big man.
[00:48:09.891 --> 00:48:12.152]  Everybody says, yeah, but see, it's the real world now.
[00:48:12.493 --> 00:48:15.674]  What if you were successful and were able to actually put a bullet in Trump?
[00:48:16.294 --> 00:48:25.758]  You're going to be in a prison for the rest of your life, stupid, begging within an hour of having handcuffs put on you to be let out to mommy.
[00:48:27.179 --> 00:48:31.221]  So, stop acting like you're a big, tough killer.
[00:48:33.294 --> 00:48:39.438]  And actually realize you've been brainwashed to not like Donald Trump by the establishment media and that you're a sucker.
[00:48:41.059 --> 00:48:44.100]  Donald Trump meets with top globalist James Baker, Kurt Nemo wrote yesterday.
[00:48:44.381 --> 00:48:46.822]  Reportedly it did not go well and they argued quite a bit.
[00:48:46.862 --> 00:48:51.525]  That's in the Hill newspaper and some other publications we're going to be going to.
[00:48:52.958 --> 00:48:53.618]  Oh, good news!
[00:48:54.118 --> 00:49:12.845]  Since the Senate started its investigation, announced it on Monday, magically our Facebook videos are getting five times the views, five times the shares, our articles are spreading, and it looks like they've removed part of the algorithm, or at least the newest algorithm that was totally suppressing us, and only have us on an older algorithm that partially suppresses us.
[00:49:14.105 --> 00:49:16.567]  See, Facebook advertises it's open free market of ideas.
[00:49:16.927 --> 00:49:18.328]  They should actually then do that.
[00:49:18.868 --> 00:49:20.649]  Or it's false advertising, isn't it?
[00:49:20.869 --> 00:49:30.355]  And then everybody who's a patriot, a libertarian, a conservative, a nationalist, a populist, can go somewhere else and build something new and free and not censor anybody.
[00:49:33.196 --> 00:49:34.197]  So that's what it comes down to.
[00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:42.222]  There is also another article here.
[00:49:47.096 --> 00:49:52.677]  How scientists are harnessing the ice-making powers of bacteria.
[00:49:52.697 --> 00:49:53.358]  That's pretty wild.
[00:49:53.998 --> 00:49:54.718]  There's another article.
[00:49:56.558 --> 00:50:00.679]  Wendy's is replacing workers with kiosks in response to fight for $15 an hour.
[00:50:00.699 --> 00:50:06.661]  Yeah, they're bringing in higher wages all over the world.
[00:50:06.721 --> 00:50:10.342]  They admit to force the move to automation to phase out humans.
[00:50:11.798 --> 00:50:19.163]  And they make you totally dependent on your government check, so they can make you take all the vaccines and go to government work brigades and basically be quote, reformed.
[00:50:20.144 --> 00:50:36.095]  And also, they are moving to remove humans out of the military command structure so that everything's automated and decisions are made by algorithms and computers.
[00:50:36.515 --> 00:50:39.858]  That's why they've now moved a woman into command of the Air Force.
[00:50:40.725 --> 00:51:00.872]  I don't think it's women, it's just that they are making it obsolete, as I've told you they would, ahead of the rise of the machines, commanded and controlled by a very small group of technocrats, less than 100 controllers, who as soon as they have full AI control, I predict, will start a coup against each other, and there will only be one master controller.
[00:51:02.347 --> 00:51:11.359]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:51:11.439 --> 00:51:19.530]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:24.532]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:45.543]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:51:45.683 --> 00:51:50.047]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:51:59.875 --> 00:52:02.077]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:52:02.458 --> 00:52:04.299]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:52:04.399 --> 00:52:06.041]  This is a Hillary Clinton ad from 2008.
[00:52:07.839 --> 00:52:08.640]  It's 3 a.m.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.442]  and your children are safe and asleep.
[00:52:11.122 --> 00:52:14.305]  But there's a phone in the White House and it's ringing.
[00:52:14.365 --> 00:52:15.747]  Something's happening in the world.
[00:52:15.767 --> 00:52:17.288]  Hello, Secretary Clinton.
[00:52:17.488 --> 00:52:19.010]  This is Ambassador Stevens.
[00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:21.132]  We are under attack here in Benghazi.
[00:52:21.172 --> 00:52:21.952]  Hello?
[00:52:22.333 --> 00:52:25.396]  H, your vote will decide who answers that call.
[00:52:25.576 --> 00:52:26.417]  Bob, what time is it?
[00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:28.097]  Oh, it's 3 a.m.?
[00:52:28.477 --> 00:52:35.219]  Whether it's someone who already knows the world's leaders, knows the military, someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous war.
[00:52:35.479 --> 00:52:36.319]  Oh, cool, she should answer.
[00:52:36.339 --> 00:52:36.939]  She said she would.
[00:52:36.959 --> 00:52:38.459]  Hello, we're under attack!
[00:52:38.979 --> 00:52:40.120]  The building's on fire!
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.680]  They're shooting at us!
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:43.380]  There's explosions!
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:44.761]  Where the f*** are you?
[00:52:44.801 --> 00:52:46.701]  You said you were gonna answer!
[00:52:46.761 --> 00:52:48.301]  Come on, Secretary Clinton!
[00:52:48.501 --> 00:52:49.402]  We need you!
[00:52:49.702 --> 00:52:50.822]  Don't leave us!
[00:52:50.902 --> 00:52:53.642]  It's 3 a.m., and your children are safe and asleep.
[00:52:53.662 --> 00:52:55.943]  Who do you want answering the phone?
[00:52:56.323 --> 00:52:58.545]  What difference at this point does it make?
[00:52:58.805 --> 00:53:00.867]  I'm Hillary Clinton, and I approve this message.
[00:53:02.149 --> 00:53:11.177]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.

[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:59.506]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:53:59.666 --> 00:54:01.828]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:16.061]  We have a bunch of guests coming up today, obviously.
[00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:24.583]  Les Jamieson, who's been involved in 9-11 Truths for, I don't know, 15 years or so, heads up HR14.org.
[00:54:25.363 --> 00:54:30.924]  Coming up next Tuesday, the head of the CIA says he may declassify parts or all of the 28 pages.
[00:54:32.065 --> 00:54:35.005]  Saudi Arabia is threatening to pull 800 plus billion out of the U.S.
[00:54:35.145 --> 00:54:35.966]  if we, quote, do.
[00:54:36.566 --> 00:54:40.927]  And yes, I know the rabbit hole goes deeper than Saudi Arabia cover-up and involvement, but
[00:54:41.963 --> 00:54:44.664]  This domino falling will knock all the others down.
[00:54:44.684 --> 00:54:57.570]  I know a lot of folks are experts on 9-11 but I am the guy that predicted it two months before and came out day one in the morning and said it was an inside job and that the Saudi Arabia was running the operation with the West.
[00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:02.912]  It's all come out now I was accurate because the FBI was saying what happened at the time.
[00:55:04.853 --> 00:55:07.834]  They were just being ignored and demoted but
[00:55:09.318 --> 00:55:15.103]  And I'm not lionizing the FBI, but it was the FBI that was actually exposing it at the bottom, not the top.
[00:55:15.643 --> 00:55:16.604]  So it's a complex issue.
[00:55:17.324 --> 00:55:18.805]  My point is, the Feds are not our enemy.
[00:55:18.865 --> 00:55:19.566]  It's just like us.
[00:55:19.626 --> 00:55:20.367]  It's made up of people.
[00:55:21.007 --> 00:55:23.369]  But the globalists have hijacked it at the top.
[00:55:23.469 --> 00:55:25.130]  We are in occupied countries, my point.
[00:55:26.091 --> 00:55:27.272]  By the Federal Reserve.
[00:55:27.312 --> 00:55:29.033]  That's the foreign banking cartel's name.
[00:55:29.554 --> 00:55:31.615]  When foreigners take over, they don't call themselves foreigners.
[00:55:31.635 --> 00:55:33.276]  They go, we're the Federal Reserve.
[00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:34.718]  Oh, there's a TPP.
[00:55:34.798 --> 00:55:35.678]  It is a foreign agreement.
[00:55:35.718 --> 00:55:36.399]  You can't see it.
[00:55:36.699 --> 00:55:37.300]  Never mind.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.741]  But we're going to raise your taxes.
[00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:43.332]  And Donald Trump goes, this is a national sovereignty screwjob.
[00:55:43.693 --> 00:55:44.293]  I'm not for it.
[00:55:44.753 --> 00:55:47.095]  Oh my gosh, he's so racist, he's so evil.
[00:55:48.516 --> 00:55:49.917]  It's the end of the world.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.101]  So that's all coming up as well.
[00:55:55.342 --> 00:56:00.466]  Before I go any further, we have almost five star reviews.
[00:56:00.526 --> 00:56:05.910]  I think it's like 4.5 stars for Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:08.192]  It is the best formula out there from our research.
[00:56:09.451 --> 00:56:13.374]  With the vitamins, the minerals from organic base, from plant derived.
[00:56:15.456 --> 00:56:16.477]  Absolutely delicious.
[00:56:17.918 --> 00:56:18.738]  Full of energy.
[00:56:19.919 --> 00:56:21.420]  And I just personally love it.
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:22.361]  My children love it.
[00:56:23.342 --> 00:56:27.025]  And I had one child that was a few pounds overweight, not too much, but a little bit.
[00:56:27.045 --> 00:56:30.488]  And I said, look, stop drinking a carton of orange juice every day and have this.
[00:56:30.648 --> 00:56:32.769]  And she's lost probably five pounds last month.
[00:56:32.829 --> 00:56:33.350]  It's amazing.
[00:56:34.311 --> 00:56:35.852]  And it is concentrated as well.
[00:56:37.441 --> 00:56:41.163]  So you'll see some other great brands and things out there that, you know, have containers twice the size.
[00:56:41.263 --> 00:56:48.105]  It's the same amount of vitamins and minerals in there that a lot of the best-selling brands out there, like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, that we also promote and sell at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[00:56:48.426 --> 00:56:56.889]  So I like both formulas at InfoWarsHealth.com, Beyond Tangy Tangerine, and then we've come up with our own plant-derived type vitamin-mineral fusion at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:56:57.429 --> 00:57:01.291]  But either one you get, they're both excellent, and it helps fund our operation, and we need the funds.
[00:57:03.192 --> 00:57:03.772]  Again, I take
[00:57:05.129 --> 00:57:07.392]  Some weeks we make extra money, some weeks we lose money.
[00:57:07.552 --> 00:57:09.614]  We're self-funded by people supporting us.
[00:57:10.054 --> 00:57:11.396]  I really appreciate your support.
[00:57:11.456 --> 00:57:12.457]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:57:12.837 --> 00:57:22.027]  We try to bring you the very best products, whether it's Hillary for President shirt, or Molon Labe, or non-GMO heirloom seeds, or shortwave radios that are solar powered, you name it, the full spectrum.
[00:57:22.648 --> 00:57:23.669]  Thousands of products.
[00:57:23.809 --> 00:57:25.771]  Infowarslife.com is the nutraceuticals.
[00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:29.694]  Infowarshealth.com, again, is the longevity nutraceuticals.
[00:57:30.035 --> 00:57:33.218]  But infowarsstore.com is the big umbrella site.
[00:57:33.238 --> 00:57:38.762]  Just go to infowarsstore.com, and that has links to infowarslife.com, madein1776.com.
[00:57:39.283 --> 00:57:40.684]  It's all the same shopping cart.
[00:57:40.904 --> 00:57:45.729]  It's just that we have little sub-URLs, because it's such a big site, to go right into the areas you want to look at.
[00:57:46.837 --> 00:57:49.578]  We're extending through Sunday and then it is over and it will be gone.
[00:57:50.238 --> 00:57:50.598]  It's over.
[00:57:51.158 --> 00:58:00.100]  We had over 60 different packages of meals at InfoWareSelect.com, or InfoWareStore.com, powered by MyPantry Supply, that were 30 to 40% off.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:04.141]  Now we can only do the four best sellers, but those are still the most popular.
[00:58:04.641 --> 00:58:06.822]  Four month, six month,
[00:58:08.268 --> 00:58:08.949]  Ear supply.
[00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.651]  It's all up there.
[00:58:10.671 --> 00:58:13.235]  It's actually four-week, three-month, teleprompter-free, folks.
[00:58:13.255 --> 00:58:14.636]  Going from memory.
[00:58:15.097 --> 00:58:18.181]  Four-week supply, three-month supply, six-month supply, one-year supply.
[00:58:18.201 --> 00:58:19.983]  40% off.
[00:58:20.143 --> 00:58:24.289]  Infowarsstore.com or infowarsselect.com takes you right to it.
[00:58:24.369 --> 00:58:26.131]  And with all the craziness in the world,
[00:58:26.912 --> 00:58:28.353]  Everybody needs to have storable food.
[00:58:28.373 --> 00:58:30.815]  This is a win-win because it's insurance you can eat.
[00:58:31.416 --> 00:58:42.945]  If things don't go to hell in a handbasket, you can always eat it because the meals are very healthy, they're delicious, they're fresh, they're clean, they're high quality from right here in the good old US of A. InfoWareStore.com, second hour, coming up.

[00:59:54.871 --> 00:59:57.485]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.066 --> 01:00:19.128]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:19.648 --> 01:00:24.492]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:24.512 --> 01:00:26.394]  I don't wanna be with your underdogs, dude.
[01:00:27.095 --> 01:00:31.138]  I don't wanna be.
[01:00:31.318 --> 01:00:36.222]  I don't wanna be with your British hood.
[01:00:36.743 --> 01:00:40.306]  Misfit for actually getting back together and going on tour.
[01:00:40.346 --> 01:00:40.826]  I want to see him.
[01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:42.147]  I don't like the whole dark culture.
[01:00:43.008 --> 01:00:43.969]  But I do like some of the music.
[01:00:45.629 --> 01:00:47.851]  Texas is the reason the President's dead!
[01:00:51.694 --> 01:00:52.975]  But it is some powerful music.
[01:00:53.956 --> 01:00:55.457]  I see you say, oh, that's something that's dark.
[01:00:55.497 --> 01:00:59.980]  What about all the stuff that masquerades as light that is really darker?
[01:01:01.542 --> 01:01:03.043]  Actually, the devil isn't dark.
[01:01:03.083 --> 01:01:05.365]  The devil masquerades as an angel of light.
[01:01:09.208 --> 01:01:10.489]  Yo, British Hill!
[01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:12.691]  Ain't no mystery!
[01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:16.851]  Well, I am in misery!
[01:01:19.832 --> 01:01:24.794]  I don't know, I might go.
[01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:26.394]  No, no, I'm not gonna go.
[01:01:32.837 --> 01:01:34.818]  But listen to those, listen to those lyrics.
[01:01:37.759 --> 01:01:43.121]  I guess the story on this song is, Misfits went over to England to play,
[01:01:44.289 --> 01:01:46.351]  And they got arrested because they were wearing their makeup.
[01:01:47.672 --> 01:01:48.533]  Len Danzig did it.
[01:01:48.573 --> 01:01:49.594]  He was in jail for a few days.
[01:01:49.634 --> 01:01:50.595]  He hated it so much.
[01:01:51.195 --> 01:01:52.457]  He said, what is your problem?
[01:01:53.077 --> 01:01:54.438]  All the corpses here are clean.
[01:01:54.458 --> 01:01:59.203]  You know, you guys have to be in your pretty jail cells.
[01:01:59.943 --> 01:02:05.148]  I mean, this place is such a tyranny that you see punk rockers walking along and you arrest them.
[01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:08.051]  I don't want to be in your British hell.
[01:02:08.151 --> 01:02:09.112]  I'm not ever coming back here.
[01:02:11.248 --> 01:02:12.449]  And that's the story on that song.
[01:02:12.869 --> 01:02:16.190]  Is he got all these hypocrites looking like they're all clean and nice in their suits.
[01:02:17.371 --> 01:02:18.171]  And look at the UK.
[01:02:19.052 --> 01:02:24.754]  Half the time you investigate some preacher, be it Catholic or Protestant, they're running some pedophile ring.
[01:02:25.154 --> 01:02:26.915]  And then a lot of times they're killing the kids.
[01:02:27.215 --> 01:02:30.897]  And the BBC's involved, and the Royal Family, and Jimmy Savelle.
[01:02:31.297 --> 01:02:33.798]  He ran all these young girls charities.
[01:02:37.369 --> 01:02:43.574]  I mean, who would put their young daughters or young foster girls 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years with Jimmy Savelle?
[01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:44.955]  Can we put him on screen for folks?
[01:02:45.656 --> 01:02:50.319]  I mean, he is the definition of the stereotypical pedophile.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:51.981]  I mean, I'll be honest.
[01:02:53.842 --> 01:02:56.464]  I see that face, I want to take a war hammer to his jaw.
[01:02:57.625 --> 01:02:59.587]  And see the whole lower mandible just rip away.
[01:03:00.828 --> 01:03:02.009]  That is as a father.
[01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:04.791]  I just want him, it's war hammer!
[01:03:06.638 --> 01:03:08.079]  Look at him getting awards from the Queen.
[01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:13.464]  All the corpses here are clean!
[01:03:14.605 --> 01:03:15.226]  That's right.
[01:03:16.908 --> 01:03:18.709]  Franklin Child Prostitution Ring.
[01:03:20.791 --> 01:03:23.313]  Yeah, that's the stuff at Omaha, Nebraska.
[01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:25.255]  I love how Wikipedia says allegations.
[01:03:25.275 --> 01:03:27.437]  There were indictments, arrests, you name it.
[01:03:29.519 --> 01:03:31.161]  It's like that line from Lord of the Rings.
[01:03:32.674 --> 01:03:37.957]  It's in the film too, but... Can you guys Google Lord of the Rings quote?
[01:03:40.278 --> 01:03:44.860]  You look fair but feel foul, but you look foul but feel fair.
[01:03:46.241 --> 01:03:47.301]  I've noticed that in my life.
[01:03:47.321 --> 01:03:53.004]  A lot of times the things that look foul are really the fairest.
[01:03:54.943 --> 01:03:58.484]  But sometimes the things that look foul are the foulest.
[01:03:59.265 --> 01:04:05.727]  Like a Savelle, sometimes when evil really unclogs, then it's so... when it just doesn't even care anymore and shows itself, it's like, whoa!
[01:04:05.747 --> 01:04:08.048]  A lot of times it's very beautiful, isn't it?
[01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:17.932]  And there's also something about twisted evil looking beautiful on the surface to the fairest heart.
[01:04:20.653 --> 01:04:24.314]  Frodo, I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer and feel fouler.
[01:04:25.967 --> 01:04:26.427]  There you go.
[01:04:26.447 --> 01:04:28.870]  I think there's a bigger quote in the actual book.
[01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:35.596]  Well, if he was one of the enemy, he would look fair and, well, feel fouler, if you see what I mean.
[01:04:35.956 --> 01:04:38.779]  Yeah, the worst of the enemy do look pretty fair, like psychos.
[01:04:39.239 --> 01:04:40.661]  I've run into people like American Psycho, folks.
[01:04:40.681 --> 01:04:41.842]  I've actually dealt with them personally.
[01:04:41.982 --> 01:04:44.364]  They look just like American Psycho, they act like it, and boy, they're evil.
[01:04:44.624 --> 01:04:45.825]  Here, let's go back and read the rest of the quote.
[01:04:46.786 --> 01:04:50.550]  Aragorn says, back laughing, while I look foul and feel fair, is that it?
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:53.761]  Frodo Baggins and Aragorn.
[01:04:54.441 --> 01:04:55.082]  That's a good book.
[01:04:55.662 --> 01:04:57.543]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, a lot of allegories.
[01:04:58.504 --> 01:05:00.625]  Turns out old J.R.R.
[01:05:00.685 --> 01:05:01.725]  Tolkien knew a thing or two.
[01:05:04.347 --> 01:05:06.848]  Caitlyn Jenner experienced sex change regret.
[01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:09.310]  Might de-transition, biographer says.
[01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:11.151]  It hasn't been easy for Caitlyn.
[01:05:11.291 --> 01:05:12.312]  It's been very hard.
[01:05:12.592 --> 01:05:18.055]  Ian Halperin recalls one source telling him, well, you are a dude dressed like a lady.
[01:05:18.315 --> 01:05:19.516]  Dude looks like a lady!
[01:05:19.636 --> 01:05:25.741]  Caitlyn Jenner, who announced her transition from man to woman last year, has considered de-transitioning.
[01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:30.065]  The author of a new book about the Kardashian family told The Wrap on Wednesday.
[01:05:30.305 --> 01:05:42.056]  Ian Halperin, the author of Kardashian Dynasty, the controversial rise of America's royal family, thanks to all you crazy leftists who want to ban freedom, have made these kind of people celebrities.
[01:05:42.196 --> 01:05:42.796]  Thank you.
[01:05:43.077 --> 01:05:46.680]  One source confirmed to me Caitlyn has made whispers of sex change regret.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.322]  You didn't even change sex!
[01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:50.564]  You're a guy with a dress on!
[01:05:50.704 --> 01:05:52.206]  Get with the program, dude!
[01:05:52.226 --> 01:05:53.287]  You're delusional!
[01:05:53.468 --> 01:05:54.569]  Put on some shorts!
[01:05:54.749 --> 01:05:57.512]  Get a tank top, eat some Wheaties, and go for a jog!
[01:05:57.632 --> 01:05:59.354]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com
[01:06:02.734 --> 01:06:05.695]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:06:05.975 --> 01:06:15.576]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[01:06:21.157 --> 01:06:29.999]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[01:06:30.279 --> 01:06:38.863]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:06:39.124 --> 01:06:46.027]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigerex herbal processing technique.
[01:06:46.167 --> 01:06:51.510]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price.
[01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:52.250]  My name is Alex Jones.
[01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:56.992]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:58.092]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[01:07:13.118 --> 01:07:27.246]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[01:07:27.646 --> 01:07:35.471]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[01:07:35.671 --> 01:07:42.095]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels
[01:07:43.076 --> 01:07:48.820]  Super male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:55.185]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of super male or super female vitality.
[01:07:55.365 --> 01:07:59.108]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139
[01:08:12.919 --> 01:08:15.280]  If you leave me, I won't miss you.
[01:08:18.941 --> 01:08:24.763]  And I won't ever take you back.
[01:08:24.783 --> 01:08:31.865]  The older you get, the more wise you get.
[01:08:43.393 --> 01:08:53.758]  But the more haunted you are by all the loves, all the pains, and all the good, the bad, and the ugly that comes with it all.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.582]  I'll say this, you either become more wise as you progress in life, or you just degenerate.
[01:09:02.583 --> 01:09:04.804]  Unfortunately, a lot of people don't become more wise.
[01:09:05.965 --> 01:09:12.468]  They just keep doubling down on the globalist paradigm of fraud and wonder why they're so unhappy.
[01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:16.765]  All right, let me run through a bunch of headlines.
[01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:19.446]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls until our guest joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:09:19.746 --> 01:09:25.068]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:09:25.088 --> 01:09:26.189]  800-259-9231.
[01:09:26.329 --> 01:09:28.930]  First-time callers on this Friday, let me add.
[01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:40.835]  And we do have one of the heroes, one of the Army Rangers assigned as a contractor, combat vet assigned to the CIA, who refused the stand-down order, will be joining us.
[01:09:40.855 --> 01:09:43.516]  He wrote the book that turned into 13 Hours.
[01:09:45.293 --> 01:09:46.334]  So that's coming up.
[01:09:47.294 --> 01:09:49.395]  And we have several other guests as well.
[01:09:52.256 --> 01:09:55.618]  The toll free number again is 800-259-9231.
[01:09:56.578 --> 01:10:00.720]  Please remember that our local A&M affiliates are under siege.
[01:10:01.441 --> 01:10:14.207]  The establishment is trying to move money away from radio, even though it still has some of the biggest audiences out there in this atomized system of media, and are trying to basically leverage out Libertarian and Patriot and Conservative radio.
[01:10:14.947 --> 01:10:17.630]  It is key to support your local affiliates carrying this show.
[01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:21.454]  It is key to support their sponsors and to become a sponsor if you can.
[01:10:21.474 --> 01:10:23.216]  This is an information war.
[01:10:24.497 --> 01:10:26.219]  You need to be all in, in my view.
[01:10:26.239 --> 01:10:28.722]  And I know a lot of you are, but now is the time to commit.
[01:10:29.687 --> 01:10:48.863]  Whether it's putting up a billboard for the local station, or whether it's becoming a sponsor, or bare minimum, sending them 50 bucks, or calling your sponsor and saying, I'm buying from you because you are supporting the Alex Jones broadcast, or any other programs that are telling the truth, basic nationalism, basic family, basic Christian values.
[01:10:49.664 --> 01:10:52.246]  And that doesn't even mean you gotta be a Christian, okay?
[01:10:52.326 --> 01:10:57.010]  I'm just saying, don't attack Christians, don't attack freedom of assembly, don't attack the Bill of Rights.
[01:10:57.978 --> 01:11:05.963]  I don't have to agree with everybody out there, just as long as you're not a tyrant, as long as you're not a globalist, who's trying to take all this tyranny and sell it like it's okay.
[01:11:07.645 --> 01:11:15.330]  And by the way, those of you that have signed on to tyranny, there's a reason the globalists want physical oppression and are trying to get that in place.
[01:11:16.451 --> 01:11:21.054]  Because they got stuff planned that's so over the top, no amount of PR is going to sell it.
[01:11:21.823 --> 01:11:26.765]  And those of you that were on board in this phase are going to be sitting in the worst position.
[01:11:27.126 --> 01:11:28.086]  It's not just history.
[01:11:28.646 --> 01:11:29.507]  It's currently happening.
[01:11:30.347 --> 01:11:33.089]  These things follow exact paradigms.
[01:11:34.049 --> 01:11:41.093]  They follow... How in criminology can top criminologists predict where a serial killer is going to strike next with frightening accuracy now?
[01:11:42.173 --> 01:11:45.235]  Using their mind, which is more powerful than any computer.
[01:11:46.595 --> 01:11:48.496]  Because criminals are so OCD.
[01:11:48.917 --> 01:11:51.418]  They follow weird little rituals they do.
[01:11:54.008 --> 01:11:56.489]  The more psychotic, the more evil, the more so.
[01:11:57.809 --> 01:12:01.491]  And following the New World Order, I mean, I've got their number, folks.
[01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:03.372]  I've been watching them for 25 years closely.
[01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:04.472]  Longer than that.
[01:12:04.512 --> 01:12:09.414]  I mean, I grew up around people that were concerned about this, but as a side issue.
[01:12:10.774 --> 01:12:16.777]  And I didn't pay much attention to it until I became a young man and was going to college.
[01:12:17.978 --> 01:12:18.558]  I don't know.
[01:12:48.652 --> 01:12:52.735]  People before them, like Barry Goldwater and all the folks that knew what was happening.
[01:12:52.755 --> 01:12:55.698]  And McCarthy was dead on, folks.
[01:12:56.378 --> 01:12:59.380]  He did some things that, you know, we see as, you know, anti-liberty.
[01:12:59.421 --> 01:13:03.404]  But when you're in a war with people that want to overthrow your government and your free system?
[01:13:07.287 --> 01:13:09.148]  At a certain point, when do the gloves come off here?
[01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:11.870]  They're not wearing gloves for us.
[01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:15.013]  They got bare knuckles or brass knuckles punches right in the teeth.
[01:13:18.257 --> 01:13:19.758]  And I want us to have the moral high ground.
[01:13:19.798 --> 01:13:27.605]  I don't want to fight the enemy and turn into them, but if you got me down in the ditch, kicking me in the stomach, I'm gonna throw sand in your eyes.
[01:13:29.967 --> 01:13:31.989]  And I'll just be honest that I'm starting to get to that point.
[01:13:38.154 --> 01:13:42.338]  I mean, we really are captured by some really screwed up people.
[01:13:42.838 --> 01:13:43.619]  Really bad people.
[01:13:45.225 --> 01:13:47.927]  And that's all I'm trying to warn people about, for heaven's sakes.
[01:13:49.387 --> 01:13:50.388]  Everybody needs to get prepared.
[01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:53.210]  You need to get family, friends focused on what's happening.
[01:13:53.230 --> 01:14:05.056]  People need to, if you haven't taken your firearms out and you got a little bit rusty, or you don't know how to use a firearm, get one, go take a safety class, and just have that bare minimum.
[01:14:05.117 --> 01:14:10.760]  Water filtration, storable food, we've got the best products, the lowest prices and info are store.com, but do your own research.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:12.221]  Whatever you do, get ready.
[01:14:13.001 --> 01:14:14.122]  But that's defense.
[01:14:15.447 --> 01:14:18.349]  Used to, I spent 90% of my time on offense, 10% on defense.
[01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:23.053]  Now I spend about 70% of my time on offense, 30% on defense.
[01:14:23.673 --> 01:14:27.756]  And I'm quite frankly, not selfish, but I have responsibility to my family.
[01:14:28.196 --> 01:14:30.138]  I'm looking very soon at going 50-50.
[01:14:30.238 --> 01:14:36.983]  I mean, it's getting to the point where info wars can't even be my priority.
[01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:38.083]  My family has to be.
[01:14:38.804 --> 01:14:39.925]  That's how real this is, folks.
[01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:43.372]  And it's very saddening to me.
[01:14:43.452 --> 01:14:43.892]  It hurts.
[01:14:44.693 --> 01:14:46.333]  Because I know what's on the other side.
[01:14:47.053 --> 01:14:48.433]  We're trying to block the gate.
[01:14:48.773 --> 01:14:49.474]  It's on fire.
[01:14:49.514 --> 01:14:50.594]  The enemy's coming over the top.
[01:14:51.254 --> 01:14:54.734]  The average person's in a trance, stumbling around, going, where's the New World Order?
[01:14:54.794 --> 01:15:08.337]  As the Pope announces it, and as societies break down everywhere, and as borders are open, and there's just burning and pillaging all over Europe, and major highways shut down in France and Germany, with just hordes of thousands robbing everyone, and civil emergencies announced.
[01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:12.512]  And the governments are like, bring more in even faster!
[01:15:12.812 --> 01:15:14.213]  Arrest anyone that criticizes it!
[01:15:14.233 --> 01:15:17.536]  And people are like, where's the depression?
[01:15:17.576 --> 01:15:21.899]  It's like all over the news, sell everything you've got, Royal Bank of Scotland, elites moving into armoured redoubts.
[01:15:21.919 --> 01:15:26.443]  And I'm like, we're still here in America that is above water, but it's rising.
[01:15:27.304 --> 01:15:30.046]  And I'm getting to the point with like, what am I trying to wake zombies up for?
[01:15:30.206 --> 01:15:33.189]  You know, it's like, we're just walking around sucking their thumbs.
[01:15:34.366 --> 01:15:38.270]  Or sitting on their thumbs, and I don't take pleasure in going, look at those idiots!
[01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:39.150]  Look at that moron!
[01:15:39.631 --> 01:15:41.393]  Look at that dumbass down there!
[01:15:41.633 --> 01:15:42.814]  Give me a little East Texas sand.
[01:15:43.975 --> 01:15:44.736]  He'll say, down there.
[01:15:45.376 --> 01:15:45.817]  Look at that!
[01:15:46.097 --> 01:15:47.538]  Look at that idiot down there!
[01:15:47.558 --> 01:15:51.562]  There's nothing funny about it, though.
[01:15:51.582 --> 01:15:52.683]  There's no enjoyment about it.
[01:15:54.505 --> 01:15:58.889]  It's like if some crazy guy at a park, I was talking to a cop once, this happened in Dallas, is on PCP.
[01:16:02.284 --> 01:16:04.005]  And they've already beat up five or six people.
[01:16:04.025 --> 01:16:05.146]  They're trying to kill somebody.
[01:16:05.166 --> 01:16:05.846]  You gotta shoot them.
[01:16:06.066 --> 01:16:08.367]  There's no pleasure in shooting a loon on PCP.
[01:16:10.768 --> 01:16:12.890]  And by pleasure, it's not even a good feeling you stopped a criminal.
[01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:14.030]  You just stopped a nut.
[01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:16.231]  They didn't even know what they were doing.
[01:16:16.952 --> 01:16:19.053]  You can't help but feel bad, even though you just saved somebody.
[01:16:20.453 --> 01:16:24.536]  And that's what it's like dealing with this public that just goes, haha, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:16:24.776 --> 01:16:25.696]  I learned that word.
[01:16:25.956 --> 01:16:26.777]  I'm real smart.
[01:16:27.997 --> 01:16:28.818]  And you're like, no, you're not.
[01:16:30.069 --> 01:16:33.372]  You just want to make me feel dumb, make yourself feel superior.
[01:16:33.392 --> 01:16:34.073]  I've actually heard that.
[01:16:34.093 --> 01:16:35.674]  I'm like, no, I don't want to feel superior to you.
[01:16:37.175 --> 01:16:37.436]  What?
[01:16:37.476 --> 01:16:38.457]  You want to feel better than people?
[01:16:38.717 --> 01:16:39.978]  I don't want to feel like I'm better than other people.
[01:16:40.398 --> 01:16:41.900]  Quite frankly, I think I'm pretty stupid.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:46.324]  But then I look at people like you and I go, my God, I'm, I'm one of the most informed.
[01:16:46.684 --> 01:16:48.025]  I'm, I'm one of the better people.
[01:16:48.185 --> 01:16:48.926]  Oh my gosh.
[01:16:49.026 --> 01:16:49.286]  Wow.
[01:16:49.667 --> 01:16:51.028]  Is our species really that good?
[01:16:57.062 --> 01:16:58.825]  And people revel in their ignorance.
[01:16:58.885 --> 01:16:59.686]  They revel in it.
[01:17:00.467 --> 01:17:03.212]  As the evil is just intensifying by the day.
[01:17:03.672 --> 01:17:06.016]  And every institution is being basically overthrown.
[01:17:06.336 --> 01:17:08.921]  And huge corruption is being set up in its place.
[01:17:12.321 --> 01:17:19.026]  I used to, I used to be mad at the basic institutions, not realizing there were globalists in them, using them to discredit them while they prepared new institutions.
[01:17:19.486 --> 01:17:21.147]  I got more sophisticated in the last seven, eight years.
[01:17:21.768 --> 01:17:23.849]  So I get why people hate the state or hate the system.
[01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:27.792]  But you gotta understand, that's only one facade of the enemy.
[01:17:28.032 --> 01:17:29.653]  Behind it is what we're dealing with.
[01:17:32.896 --> 01:17:36.438]  They'd love it if we went and had some civil war and burned down our local cities.
[01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:37.058]  They'd love that.
[01:17:37.979 --> 01:17:38.399]  They'd love it.
[01:17:38.419 --> 01:17:41.882]  They'd love it when Black Lives Matter goes and, you know, shoots some cop in the back of the head.
[01:17:43.117 --> 01:17:44.158]  Total idiocy!
[01:17:48.261 --> 01:17:49.302]  But these are epic times.
[01:17:49.382 --> 01:17:51.064]  I'm just saying, it's on.
[01:17:51.404 --> 01:17:53.246]  I shouldn't even have to prove anything else, okay?
[01:17:53.526 --> 01:17:54.847]  I mean, it's just in your face.
[01:17:55.067 --> 01:17:56.028]  They've got bad will.
[01:17:56.248 --> 01:17:57.129]  They're coming after us.
[01:17:57.169 --> 01:18:02.534]  They want to shut off our resources and make us dependent, not so they can re-engineer us and make us better.
[01:18:02.954 --> 01:18:04.255]  That always turns into a nightmare.
[01:18:06.417 --> 01:18:08.499]  Because I deserve my free will, so I'm not turning it over to you.
[01:18:09.517 --> 01:18:18.860]  The globalists admit, oh no, they just want to get control to kind of phase humans out, as we know it, and in an orderly, cultural culling.
[01:18:23.042 --> 01:18:23.822]  So I'll say it again.
[01:18:28.004 --> 01:18:30.504]  What are we going to do about this situation?
[01:18:31.425 --> 01:18:32.665]  What are you going to do for your children?
[01:18:33.045 --> 01:18:34.126]  What are you going to do for your family?
[01:18:35.612 --> 01:18:39.775]  World government's here, and the collapse of the world system by design, incrementally, is here.
[01:18:39.835 --> 01:18:40.535]  We're now in it.
[01:18:41.056 --> 01:18:42.917]  And it gets a lot worse the deeper we go.
[01:18:44.978 --> 01:18:48.120]  So do I even sit here and argue with people about global government?
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.101]  Or argue with it?
[01:18:49.701 --> 01:18:50.862]  Argue that it's totalitarian?
[01:18:51.903 --> 01:18:52.743]  I mean, what do I do?
[01:18:52.783 --> 01:18:54.885]  That's a question for listeners I'd like to ask.
[01:18:56.746 --> 01:18:58.687]  Some of the articles up on Infowars.com.
[01:18:58.707 --> 01:19:02.470]  Hillary Clinton, owned by despotic sheikdoms, Kurt Nemob,
[01:19:03.922 --> 01:19:05.804]  Corruption, quote, beyond comprehension.
[01:19:06.564 --> 01:19:12.209]  Her foundation alone has gotten a hundred million dollars from autocratic regimes in the Middle East and it goes over it.
[01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:26.802]  I mean, crazy town folks that literally keep women in dungeons and are like something out of a, you know, Disney movie, like villains hobbling around like demonic ravens feeding on the people's souls.
[01:19:28.744 --> 01:19:30.005]  I mean, it's just disgusting.
[01:19:31.721 --> 01:19:34.582]  And of course, it's led by the chief feminist, so it's okay.
[01:19:34.602 --> 01:19:43.825]  It's like Hitler, you know, you know, should get ADL awards, you know, because they give Schwarzenegger and George Soros to them, but then if you're actually a Nazi hunter, the ADL says you're a Nazi.
[01:19:43.865 --> 01:19:45.146]  I mean, it's almost gotten to that point.
[01:19:45.566 --> 01:19:47.486]  And you got Hillary up here, I'm a woman, it's okay!
[01:19:47.626 --> 01:19:48.147]  Ha ha!
[01:19:48.387 --> 01:19:51.088]  I support theocracy and women being slaves!
[01:19:51.288 --> 01:19:57.690]  But she's going to teach women to hate their husbands and screw this country up, the place where women's suffrage comes from.
[01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:01.768]  Now let's just destroy the birthplace of all the freedom, as Hillary said.
[01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:05.570]  There is an attack on the human institution of family.
[01:20:06.311 --> 01:20:09.913]  And if you want to take down the nuclear family, you attack males.
[01:20:10.793 --> 01:20:14.595]  Males are the defender of the human tribe.
[01:20:15.155 --> 01:20:19.878]  When men fall, the rest of humanity can be completely enslaved.
[01:20:20.658 --> 01:20:24.341]  The attack on the family is in movies, sitcoms, dramas.
[01:20:24.641 --> 01:20:26.162]  This isn't to empower women.
[01:20:26.642 --> 01:20:28.163]  This is to wreck civilization.
[01:20:28.403 --> 01:20:34.107]  For too long, we have been allowing the globalist controllers to launch a full-scale chemical war on our masculinity.
[01:20:34.307 --> 01:20:35.388]  You've seen the headlines.
[01:20:35.428 --> 01:20:41.011]  The estrogen mimickers and the gender-bending compounds and the food and water supply are changing the way our bodies work.
[01:20:41.151 --> 01:20:44.934]  And men are the number one target of this program.
[01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:51.356]  With the estrogen mimickers in the plastics, in the printer paper, and in thousands of other items, it's on record.
[01:20:51.656 --> 01:20:58.058]  Our testosterone level, many times by the time we hit 40, is 80% lower than it should be or more.
[01:20:58.258 --> 01:21:05.780]  Our sperm counts, depending on which western country you look at, are 80 to almost 96% reduced.
[01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:09.461]  Fertility is plummeting through the floor.
[01:21:10.082 --> 01:21:13.663]  Now, it's impossible, even if you're a health nut, to avoid all of this.
[01:21:14.443 --> 01:21:20.987]  But for myself personally, what I've experienced with the products at Infowarslife.com has been simply amazing.
[01:21:21.888 --> 01:21:25.170]  Supermail Vitality has changed my life in the last three years.
[01:21:25.490 --> 01:21:31.693]  That's why we wanted to develop something that works in conjunction with Supermail to take it to the next level.
[01:21:32.154 --> 01:21:33.635]  It's only been out for about six months.
[01:21:34.475 --> 01:21:43.304]  It sold out so quickly in its first run, and now it is back after months of not being available, Anthroplex.
[01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:55.376]  The reason we sell out when other big vitamin and mineral and nutraceutical makers don't is because we only source the purest, cleanest, high quality,
[01:21:55.936 --> 01:22:06.820]  Organic products and it's really hard when you've got a formulation that's got a bunch of really great ingredients in it to get them and to always have them be perfectly clean and to be able to pass some of the highest standards in the world.
[01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:17.984]  When you go to Infowarslife.com you can see that for yourself and find out why Anthroplex taken by itself or in conjunction with Super Male Vitality is such a game changer.
[01:22:18.304 --> 01:22:19.545]  This is the next level.
[01:22:20.505 --> 01:22:24.468]  And I'm so proud that we were able to bring a product like this to you.
[01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:27.750]  This is how men were supposed to feel.
[01:22:28.071 --> 01:22:32.474]  Quite frankly, I remember what it felt like to be 18 or 19 or 20.
[01:22:33.014 --> 01:22:37.658]  To be crazed, to be aggressive, to feel just exhilaration.
[01:22:38.478 --> 01:22:41.781]  And it's the super metal vitality in the Anthroplex.
[01:22:42.361 --> 01:22:47.866]  With exercise and a better diet that have taken me back to where I was and, quite frankly, beyond.
[01:22:48.286 --> 01:22:48.967]  It's amazing.
[01:22:49.167 --> 01:22:53.010]  And Anthroplex is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[01:22:53.331 --> 01:22:58.855]  Men, do yourself a favor and get a bottle of Anthroplex today and see what I'm talking about.
[01:22:59.376 --> 01:23:07.103]  All of our products at Infowarslife.com are recognized as safe and they are made in FDA certified labs.
[01:23:07.603 --> 01:23:13.567]  The media tries to demonize supplements because, quite frankly, Mother Nature's got a lot to offer that Big Pharma doesn't.
[01:23:14.188 --> 01:23:18.751]  But there are some bad companies out there and there are some substances that Mother Nature produces that aren't good for you.
[01:23:19.451 --> 01:23:27.857]  That's why everything we put in these products is recognized as safe and produced at the highest level, highest quality FDA certified labs.
[01:23:28.297 --> 01:23:36.482]  Talk to your physician or healthcare provider before you take Anthraplex or any of the products at InfoWarsLife.com like X2.
[01:23:36.982 --> 01:23:39.064]  Because this stuff's real.
[01:23:39.444 --> 01:23:42.726]  Just one of the ingredients in Anthraplex is horny goat weed.
[01:23:43.006 --> 01:23:48.770]  In Chinese traditional medicine, it is recognized as one of the most powerful male stimulants.
[01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:51.995]  Not just of libido, but overall vitality.
[01:23:52.376 --> 01:23:58.807]  We put together a classic formula, souped up with the highest quality at a very low price.
[01:23:59.288 --> 01:24:01.712]  Available at Infowarslife.com today.
[01:24:11.027 --> 01:24:14.988]  We got Richard, Kirby, Ruben, Aaron, Leandra, and others.
[01:24:15.008 --> 01:24:16.429]  We're going to your calls right now.
[01:24:16.449 --> 01:24:19.750]  The guest is just popping in for like 10 minutes on the 9-11 pages.
[01:24:19.770 --> 01:24:22.390]  28 pages that are so close to coming out next week.
[01:24:23.011 --> 01:24:23.711]  Will they come out?
[01:24:23.731 --> 01:24:25.431]  The CIA hasn't told us yet.
[01:24:25.451 --> 01:24:27.472]  They're doing a cliffhanger deal.
[01:24:28.532 --> 01:24:32.073]  Obviously blackmailing the Saudis to see if they agree.
[01:24:32.093 --> 01:24:35.174]  We're going to be breaking all of that down as I just mentioned.
[01:24:35.194 --> 01:24:38.135]  But right now, let's go to Richard in North Carolina.
[01:24:38.175 --> 01:24:39.175]  Says he's a Trump supporter.
[01:24:39.496 --> 01:24:40.256]  Wants to talk about it.
[01:24:40.296 --> 01:24:40.596]  Go ahead.
[01:24:42.082 --> 01:24:42.743]  Hello, Alex.
[01:24:42.823 --> 01:24:44.564]  It's an honor to be able to talk to you.
[01:24:44.584 --> 01:24:45.745]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:24:45.985 --> 01:24:46.966]  Welcome.
[01:24:47.046 --> 01:25:00.536]  And I'm also a black male, and I'll try to fit in as much as I can really quick, because there's a million things I could say, but I've been listening to you probably for about seven years now, and I almost fell victim to the media spin.
[01:25:00.676 --> 01:25:06.200]  At first, I thought you were like some kind of weird racist guy, and then I actually started
[01:25:06.903 --> 01:25:11.165]  I started actually listening to you and paying attention and everything.
[01:25:11.405 --> 01:25:14.967]  Every single thing that you have said is 100% truth.
[01:25:15.187 --> 01:25:18.669]  And I'm saying this because I go back and research stuff after you.
[01:25:18.829 --> 01:25:19.950]  Well, thank you for your kind words.
[01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:22.651]  I mean, I'd say I'm probably 96, 97% accurate.
[01:25:22.691 --> 01:25:23.311]  I make mistakes.
[01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:23.811]  Here's the difference.
[01:25:23.831 --> 01:25:24.332]  I mean, you're right.
[01:25:25.293 --> 01:25:26.993]  I try to tell the truth 100% of the time.
[01:25:27.093 --> 01:25:28.134]  I get some things wrong.
[01:25:28.774 --> 01:25:35.295]  Sometimes I've got a guest on and I'm not allowed to say everything, so I'm trying to like get it out, but without saying it all and breaking confidence.
[01:25:35.315 --> 01:25:41.497]  So then I'll say something later that I don't quite agree with, but I'm trying to tell the truth is the difference.
[01:25:41.537 --> 01:25:42.777]  So thank you for your kind words, sir.
[01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:43.317]  God bless you.
[01:25:43.537 --> 01:25:43.817]  Go ahead.
[01:25:44.937 --> 01:25:49.238]  Well, my spidey senses have been going crazy because I was really quick.
[01:25:49.258 --> 01:25:51.799]  I was born and raised in the inner city, what you would call the hood.
[01:25:53.182 --> 01:25:54.202]  I went to Sunday school.
[01:25:54.222 --> 01:25:59.026]  My mom made us go to church as kids, so I learned through church about the New World Order.
[01:25:59.286 --> 01:26:06.951]  It wasn't until I became probably in my 20s when I started hearing Reagan and the Bushes, both Bushes, talking about the New World Order.
[01:26:08.132 --> 01:26:09.293]  I go into scripture.
[01:26:09.393 --> 01:26:10.154]  I read all of it.
[01:26:10.374 --> 01:26:13.096]  Everything that is happening right now is taking place today.
[01:26:13.576 --> 01:26:15.297]  Fast forward to this election.
[01:26:15.317 --> 01:26:17.419]  This election is really exposed.
[01:26:17.779 --> 01:26:20.081]  Everything is showing how everything is rigged.
[01:26:20.221 --> 01:26:21.862]  If people don't see this, they're blind.
[01:26:22.222 --> 01:26:32.206]  I think a lot of people are just hating on Trump because he's wealthy so people can't see past the wealth to see that he really is our only chance to at least
[01:26:32.645 --> 01:26:36.367]  Look, one world government is going to happen, because it's scriptural, it's written.
[01:26:36.387 --> 01:26:38.248]  It's going to happen, but we can fight it.
[01:26:38.268 --> 01:26:43.592]  I don't want to just get... Sure, because doesn't the Bible say it's our job to resist it?
[01:26:44.112 --> 01:26:45.613]  Because it's about waking people up.
[01:26:45.853 --> 01:26:52.217]  The world system is going to come into place, but then it's going to fall very, very quickly, according to scripture, and that's when people really wake up.
[01:26:52.277 --> 01:26:57.120]  So, we lose the first half of the game, but we end up winning the game itself.
[01:26:58.387 --> 01:26:59.948]  Yes, there is no rapture.
[01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:05.009]  You know, people who do make it through tribulation, there will be people who will make it through.
[01:27:05.029 --> 01:27:06.450]  You have to fight, though.
[01:27:06.490 --> 01:27:08.290]  You can't just lay down and take it, you know?
[01:27:08.911 --> 01:27:15.173]  And I don't think that they're going to let Trump become president because this one world government system is so strong.
[01:27:15.213 --> 01:27:18.094]  I think they'll try to JFK him, or I think that
[01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:21.071]  There's going to be some kind of false flag or something like that.
[01:27:21.091 --> 01:27:22.032]  Sure, I'll say this.
[01:27:22.192 --> 01:27:27.915]  If he is a deceiver, it's one of the most sophisticated deceptions I've ever seen because the globalists are genuinely upset at him.
[01:27:27.955 --> 01:27:29.376]  What he's doing is hurting their program.
[01:27:29.857 --> 01:27:40.343]  But he could be, and I'm not saying I believe this, a super double-crosser who's another globalist that wants to come in and get a more dominant position, maybe at the top of the New World Order, by claiming to be a nationalist.
[01:27:41.323 --> 01:27:45.086]  That's what's happening is they don't even want a discussion of nationalism going on.
[01:27:45.646 --> 01:27:58.715]  Or at a higher level, he's probably real and they're letting him do this to try to destroy him later and try to basically defeat a populist movement early before the potential for it to win and succeed really peaks.
[01:27:58.936 --> 01:28:01.838]  Because once we're in a full bore depression and people can't deny it,
[01:28:02.358 --> 01:28:05.982]  Richard, that's when a populist like Trump would be invincible.
[01:28:06.562 --> 01:28:11.707]  And so that's why they may want to basically trigger this revolution early to make sure it fizzles out.
[01:28:11.727 --> 01:28:12.328]  But let me say this.
[01:28:12.869 --> 01:28:18.815]  We talk about moral courage with these Navy SEALs and Army Rangers that were in the CIA detail at Benghazi and didn't stand down.
[01:28:18.875 --> 01:28:21.097]  We have one of them joining us coming up in an hour and a half.
[01:28:21.777 --> 01:28:22.738]  Amazing courage.
[01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:30.896]  But somebody like you, who has the courage to support Trump, a nationalist, a populist, it takes courage if you're white to do it, or Hispanic.
[01:28:31.216 --> 01:28:45.763]  But to be, you know, a black man and to do it, and these black folks and others, you know, who go out at these demonstrations, who get targeted by the justice warriors and the rest of them, you know, those folks really get a hat tip from me.
[01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:48.184]  So, I mean, I admire your courage.
[01:28:49.261 --> 01:28:56.711]  There's way more minorities who are actually pulling for Trump than the media has been, and you have awakened a whole lot of people, Alex.
[01:28:56.731 --> 01:29:01.598]  You might not know it, but I have millions of black friends.
[01:29:01.618 --> 01:29:05.584]  I work with the majority of white folks.
[01:29:07.105 --> 01:29:11.807]  There are so many people that are becoming awake now, and it's because of you, and of course, God.
[01:29:11.847 --> 01:29:13.868]  God is lifting the veil on a lot of this stuff.
[01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:14.508]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:29:14.528 --> 01:29:15.989]  I'm just one little part of the wave.
[01:29:16.049 --> 01:29:23.712]  I'm just a few drops of the big wave, and Trump's just a few drops, but all of us together are the big wave coming in to say no to world government, no to what's happening.
[01:29:23.732 --> 01:29:29.514]  And they may be able to suppress this wave, but as the Bible shows us, the beast reigns for one hour.
[01:29:30.803 --> 01:29:31.184]  One hour.
[01:29:31.304 --> 01:29:35.627]  And preachers can say in biblical times that means a season, a year, a cycle, whatever.
[01:29:36.168 --> 01:29:36.608]  One hour.
[01:29:37.489 --> 01:29:42.293]  He's given one hour so that the whole world is shown what a con artist the devil is.
[01:29:42.533 --> 01:29:46.796]  And we see earlier tremors of this, like Obamacare being such a screwjob.
[01:29:47.157 --> 01:29:49.418]  Everybody's going to find out it wasn't free and rips you off.
[01:29:49.859 --> 01:29:51.400]  You're going to be warned first.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:52.761]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.222 --> 01:29:54.823]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.764 --> 01:29:58.446]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.419 --> 01:30:05.281]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:30:05.361 --> 01:30:07.022]  This is a Hillary Clinton ad from 2008.
[01:30:07.162 --> 01:30:09.625]  It's 3 a.m.
[01:30:09.705 --> 01:30:11.406]  and your children are safe and asleep.
[01:30:12.127 --> 01:30:15.270]  But there's a phone in the White House and it's ringing.
[01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:16.791]  Something's happening in the world.
[01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:18.272]  Hello, Secretary Clinton.
[01:30:18.453 --> 01:30:19.994]  This is Ambassador Stevens.
[01:30:20.034 --> 01:30:22.116]  We are under attack here in Benghazi.
[01:30:22.156 --> 01:30:22.917]  Hello?
[01:30:23.337 --> 01:30:26.360]  H, your vote will decide who answers that call.
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.401]  Bob, what time is it?
[01:30:28.241 --> 01:30:29.082]  Oh, it's 3 a.m.?
[01:30:29.462 --> 01:30:37.385]  Whether it's someone who already knows the world's leaders, knows the military, someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous war... Oh, cool, she should answer.
[01:30:37.425 --> 01:30:37.905]  She said she would.
[01:30:37.945 --> 01:30:39.446]  Hello, we're under attack!
[01:30:39.966 --> 01:30:41.127]  The building's on fire!
[01:30:41.647 --> 01:30:42.647]  They're shooting at us!
[01:30:42.947 --> 01:30:44.348]  There's explosions!
[01:30:44.748 --> 01:30:45.769]  Where the f*** are you?
[01:30:45.809 --> 01:30:47.672]  You said you were going to answer!
[01:30:47.732 --> 01:30:49.274]  Come on, Secretary Clinton!
[01:30:49.514 --> 01:30:50.375]  We need you!
[01:30:50.675 --> 01:30:51.296]  Don't leave us!
[01:30:51.576 --> 01:30:52.357]  It's 3 a.m.
[01:30:52.938 --> 01:30:54.740]  and your children are safe and asleep.
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:57.263]  Who do you want answering the phone?
[01:30:57.323 --> 01:30:59.566]  What difference at this point does it make?
[01:30:59.806 --> 01:31:01.828]  I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
[01:31:03.095 --> 01:31:04.115]  BrainForce is here.
[01:31:04.655 --> 01:31:06.936]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:31:07.196 --> 01:31:15.038]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:31:15.798 --> 01:31:19.379]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[01:31:19.399 --> 01:31:21.740]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:25.601]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:31:25.661 --> 01:31:28.782]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:31:29.282 --> 01:31:34.530]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:31:34.630 --> 01:31:36.473]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[01:31:36.813 --> 01:31:41.240]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.423]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:31:44.044 --> 01:31:45.486]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:31:45.646 --> 01:31:45.886]  Exactly.
[01:31:45.926 --> 01:31:49.711]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:31:50.212 --> 01:31:58.201]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:03.078 --> 01:32:05.681]  We could have saved Navy SEALs in Benghazi.
[01:32:05.841 --> 01:32:09.685]  F-16 pilots in Italy were on standby to help besiege U.S.
[01:32:09.765 --> 01:32:13.049]  forces in Libya, but the order to launch never came.
[01:32:13.269 --> 01:32:13.770]  A U.S.
[01:32:13.890 --> 01:32:19.496]  Air Force source has claimed that a squadron of attack jets was being armed and fueled on the night of the deadly attack.
[01:32:19.676 --> 01:32:30.781]  On the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, the jets, believed to be F-16s, were on the runway ready to launch, as terrorists bombarded the U.S.
[01:32:30.821 --> 01:32:33.222]  consulate, killing four Americans.
[01:32:33.423 --> 01:32:45.248]  The source claims the fighters could have launched from Aviano Air Force Base in northern Italy and refueled at Naval Air Station Sigonella before providing air support over Benghazi.
[01:32:45.448 --> 01:32:48.490]  And yet, all we hear is Hillary Clinton saying,
[01:32:51.252 --> 01:32:56.757]  She is the most vile, un-American human being to ever live.
[01:32:56.897 --> 01:32:59.319]  She is pure evil in the flesh.
[01:32:59.579 --> 01:33:02.161]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[01:33:20.495 --> 01:33:21.336]  Los Angeles.
[01:33:21.476 --> 01:33:22.457]  Clone Radio.
[01:33:22.697 --> 01:33:26.540]  We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else.
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:27.621]  Clone.
[01:33:30.063 --> 01:33:31.004]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:33:31.284 --> 01:33:32.305]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:33:32.605 --> 01:33:33.486]  Mao took the guns.
[01:33:33.666 --> 01:33:34.987]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:33:35.027 --> 01:33:35.207]  How many?
[01:33:35.227 --> 01:33:39.091]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:33:39.111 --> 01:33:42.453]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[01:33:44.555 --> 01:33:47.558]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:34:01.237 --> 01:34:02.739]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:34:03.059 --> 01:34:09.386]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:16.133 --> 01:34:18.276]  Give me some more truth.
[01:34:20.083 --> 01:34:30.945]  I want to play a brief special report that we did months ago during the early primaries with Richard Reeves, John Bowne and others when we were exposing the fact that Jeb Bush was connected to 9-11, the 28 pages.
[01:34:31.385 --> 01:34:37.946]  Trump picked up on that obviously and now you've got the CIA director saying they may release it next week.
[01:34:39.166 --> 01:34:43.787]  So we're going to play this special report and have a guest pop in and then go back to your calls and other news.
[01:34:44.407 --> 01:34:48.368]  But our government and criminal elements within other governments
[01:34:49.491 --> 01:34:53.614]  Funding and financing and protecting radical jihadists is an old story.
[01:34:55.816 --> 01:35:01.019]  But the chapters now are coming quicker and quicker and are worse and worse and we're out of control.
[01:35:01.379 --> 01:35:02.780]  We're going to play that special report in a moment.
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:03.261]  First off...
[01:35:05.037 --> 01:35:12.303]  InfoWarsTore.com has thousands of amazing items, some of the best-selling top items available on the Internet and available in stores around the world.
[01:35:12.343 --> 01:35:16.966]  We buy them in bulk, sell them at the lowest prices, in many cases below Amazon.
[01:35:17.146 --> 01:35:19.188]  And almost no one else will do that.
[01:35:19.648 --> 01:35:22.510]  We have high-quality, affordable foods at the very lowest prices you're going to find.
[01:35:23.371 --> 01:35:36.625]  We have one of the biggest sales we've ever run running on the four top best sellers right now and in Sunday, 30 to 40 percent off on the four-week, the three-month, the six-month, the one-year food supply at InfoWareStore.com powered by MyPatriotSupply.
[01:35:36.645 --> 01:35:39.888]  We have the full spectrum of all their meals and InfoWare Select right there.
[01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:42.871]  And your purchase, again, helps fund this operation.
[01:35:43.492 --> 01:35:45.394]  We also have the Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:35:46.414 --> 01:35:48.275]  The first run sold out is very, very popular.
[01:35:48.536 --> 01:35:53.840]  You want a multivitamin, you actually absorb from an organic or plant-based derivative.
[01:35:54.801 --> 01:35:59.324]  It is fruit punch, naturally flavored by the vitamins and minerals and things that are in it.
[01:36:00.085 --> 01:36:07.811]  It is really amazing and a lot of the folks that are what I call supplement Nazis out there, meaning they really want the highest standards, a.k.a.
[01:36:08.171 --> 01:36:14.716]  Soup Nazi from Seinfeld, it is available right there at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:16.972 --> 01:36:22.754]  Or you can simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:23.935 --> 01:36:29.237]  And believe me, folks, most people that take these hard vitamins don't absorb most of it.
[01:36:30.037 --> 01:36:33.819]  If it's a vitamin and it's powder form, that's a lot better where it's in a gel caplet.
[01:36:34.439 --> 01:36:36.060]  And we have products that are based like that.
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:37.020]  You do absorb a lot of that.
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:45.744]  But when it's liquid, it's even better because the saliva starts breaking it down in your mouth, then it goes into your stomach, and then it just really gets absorbed that way.
[01:36:47.702 --> 01:36:49.943]  Infowarslife.com is where you'll find our new proceuticals.
[01:36:50.283 --> 01:36:52.184]  Infowarsstore.com is the big umbrella site.
[01:36:52.684 --> 01:36:54.805]  Orders of $50 or more, you get free shipping.
[01:36:54.825 --> 01:36:59.228]  You get an additional 10% off the discounts we already have when you sign up for AutoShip as well.
[01:37:00.498 --> 01:37:10.362]  And again, you're finding the very tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and exposing the global crime syndicates that are working together like a hydra to bring in this anti-human planetary regime.
[01:37:10.382 --> 01:37:16.504]  So, InfoWorksStore.com or InfoWorksLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:37:17.085 --> 01:37:25.148]  Super male vitality and super female vitality are our best sellers because they're organic, cold-pressed, herbs and compounds known.
[01:37:25.948 --> 01:37:38.195]  To basically go in and counteract the estrogen blockers and the, in some cases, or the estrogen mimickers and really just get your glands operating the way they should be.
[01:37:38.475 --> 01:37:39.736]  All I know is it really works for me.
[01:37:40.496 --> 01:37:49.222]  It's got close to five star reviews, 4.5 reviews, thousands of reviews, by the way, on super male vitality, almost 300 for super female vitality.
[01:37:50.882 --> 01:37:53.264]  Check it out for yourself today, but it's sold out.
[01:37:55.543 --> 01:37:56.743]  Or did it just come back in?
[01:37:56.763 --> 01:37:58.384]  Because I saw it was sold out yesterday.
[01:37:59.404 --> 01:38:00.544]  Oh, female is still available.
[01:38:00.584 --> 01:38:01.725]  Super male is sold out.
[01:38:01.785 --> 01:38:02.905]  So I guess female came back in.
[01:38:03.205 --> 01:38:03.965]  So that's some good news.
[01:38:04.005 --> 01:38:08.066]  And quite frankly, super female works just as good on men as it does as women.
[01:38:08.346 --> 01:38:09.907]  But people want a female formula.
[01:38:10.287 --> 01:38:13.668]  So it's tweaked a little bit and has a couple things in it that the male doesn't have.
[01:38:14.308 --> 01:38:17.649]  But quite frankly, I think it works better than the male.
[01:38:18.209 --> 01:38:18.829]  It's kind of goofy.
[01:38:18.909 --> 01:38:19.850]  I'd take super female.
[01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:21.030]  I'd let Alex Jones buy this.
[01:38:22.748 --> 01:38:25.751]  If I forget to bring a bottle home, I've run out, and there's some females sitting around.
[01:38:25.791 --> 01:38:27.012]  I just bam that back.
[01:38:27.032 --> 01:38:28.374]  It does the exact same thing, quite frankly.
[01:38:28.794 --> 01:38:33.399]  So, Super Female Vitality, try it for yourself, and your purchase does fund the operation.
[01:38:33.499 --> 01:38:35.921]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[01:38:36.041 --> 01:38:36.262]  Okay.
[01:38:37.563 --> 01:38:42.388]  Here is the John Bowne report with Richard Reeves.
[01:38:44.346 --> 01:38:49.008]  That basically began the beginning of the end of the Bush candidacy to a great extent.
[01:38:49.308 --> 01:38:53.570]  Donald Trump took it over the top, obviously, and deserves great credit for that.
[01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:57.792]  But let's look at this in context of the 28 pages set to come out next week.
[01:38:59.087 --> 01:38:59.347]  Thanks.
[01:38:59.387 --> 01:38:59.967]  You doing well?
[01:39:00.108 --> 01:39:00.568]  Excellent.
[01:39:00.588 --> 01:39:01.508]  Good to see you.
[01:39:01.528 --> 01:39:02.269]  Governor Bush.
[01:39:02.349 --> 01:39:03.129]  How we doing?
[01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.930]  Good to see you, man.
[01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:04.450]  Alright, good.
[01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:05.150]  How you doing?
[01:39:05.891 --> 01:39:10.673]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 Commission report?
[01:39:10.693 --> 01:39:10.893]  Yeah, sure.
[01:39:10.913 --> 01:39:11.994]  Would you be one to see those released?
[01:39:12.774 --> 01:39:13.515]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[01:39:13.535 --> 01:39:14.915]  You got them?
[01:39:15.035 --> 01:39:15.636]  Andrew, you may have them.
[01:39:15.656 --> 01:39:16.336]  Hopefully we can get them.
[01:39:16.576 --> 01:39:17.157]  Thank you.
[01:39:17.477 --> 01:39:21.479]  Would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 Commission report?
[01:39:21.499 --> 01:39:21.719]  Yeah, sure.
[01:39:21.739 --> 01:39:23.040]  Would you be one to see those released?
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:24.580]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:25.961]  You got them?
[01:39:26.081 --> 01:39:26.682]  Andrew, you may have them.
[01:39:26.702 --> 01:39:27.382]  Hopefully we can get them.
[01:39:28.162 --> 01:39:32.084]  For the few who have seen them, they're known as the 28 pages.
[01:39:32.464 --> 01:39:39.167]  In those pages are names of people who allegedly helped the Al-Qaeda killers, but who have never been held accountable.
[01:39:39.187 --> 01:39:46.470]  Potential sources of foreign support for the September 11th hijackers, classified by the Bush administration.
[01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:51.012]  Why the 28 pages remain hidden from the public remains a mystery.
[01:39:51.192 --> 01:39:56.777]  We know the 28 pages from Senator Graham and Senator Jones that have seen it, and military we've had on that have seen it.
[01:39:57.037 --> 01:39:59.879]  It says Saudi Arabia ran the attacks to blame Iraq.
[01:39:59.919 --> 01:40:00.840]  That was always the plan.
[01:40:01.441 --> 01:40:03.322]  And then our own government, bare minimum, stood down.
[01:40:03.442 --> 01:40:04.623]  And of course, it was more than that.
[01:40:05.044 --> 01:40:08.967]  But we have the fact that it now, to a great extent, was an inside job.
[01:40:09.267 --> 01:40:14.032]  I have read the 28 pages and the 28 pages have nothing to do with national security.
[01:40:14.273 --> 01:40:14.593]  Nothing.
[01:40:14.793 --> 01:40:15.794]  I wouldn't be standing here.
[01:40:16.275 --> 01:40:19.579]  It's all about relationships and involvement in 9-11.
[01:40:19.779 --> 01:40:22.182]  I want those documents declassified.
[01:40:22.222 --> 01:40:25.986]  I'm embarrassed to be associated with a work product.
[01:40:27.068 --> 01:40:27.728]  That is secret.
[01:40:28.109 --> 01:40:39.076]  I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the September 11th attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia.
[01:40:39.476 --> 01:40:41.337]  He called it a smoking gun.
[01:40:41.738 --> 01:40:48.202]  And he went on to say the reason for this cover-up goes right up to the White House.
[01:40:48.562 --> 01:40:50.183]  This is sort of shocking when you read it.
[01:40:50.363 --> 01:40:52.365]  As I read it, we all had our own experience.
[01:40:52.885 --> 01:41:04.135]  I had to stop every couple pages and just sort of absorb and try to rearrange my understanding of history for the past 13 years and the years leading up to that.
[01:41:04.755 --> 01:41:07.478]  It challenges you to rethink everything.
[01:41:08.138 --> 01:41:12.321]  What do we know is in the 28 censored pages of the 9-11 report?
[01:41:12.662 --> 01:41:15.023]  People that have seen it said it would bring down the whole system.
[01:41:15.364 --> 01:41:18.966]  I've met with and talked to multiple members of Congress who read it.
[01:41:18.986 --> 01:41:21.168]  They are convinced the American people need to see it.
[01:41:21.188 --> 01:41:27.513]  It has to do with information which is not convenient to the White House, either White House, the Clinton White House or the Bush White House.
[01:41:27.973 --> 01:41:34.398]  And it has to do with an ally, but since it looked the other way, it allowed a lot of support for the terrorists who conducted the attack.
[01:41:34.478 --> 01:41:37.361]  We're here today to call for the release of those 28 pages.
[01:41:38.672 --> 01:41:47.658]  The survivors, civilian heroes, and families of the victims of September 11 terrorist attacks, some of whom are here today, deserve the full truth.
[01:41:48.178 --> 01:41:59.325]  We cannot let page after page of blanked-out documents be obscured behind a veil, leaving these families to wonder if there is additional information surrounding these four blacks.
[01:41:59.645 --> 01:42:04.748]  My son, Matthew C. Salido, was murdered September 11, 2001.
[01:42:07.410 --> 01:42:10.912]  On September 11th, I lost my husband Tom Strada.
[01:42:11.293 --> 01:42:19.058]  My husband Victor was the captain of United Flight 175 that struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11th at 9.03 a.m.
[01:42:19.338 --> 01:42:26.443]  My father never got to see me compete on my horse, cheer me on at a lacrosse game, or hear me speak at my middle school graduation.
[01:42:27.083 --> 01:42:33.628]  When you tell me there's a security risk and that's the reason
[01:42:35.527 --> 01:42:37.928]  You're not making these public?
[01:42:39.069 --> 01:42:44.092]  Mr. President, I call you a liar.
[01:42:44.592 --> 01:42:47.053]  He would be laughing and saying, you go get him, Terry.
[01:42:47.113 --> 01:42:48.094]  You go get him.
[01:42:48.374 --> 01:42:50.335]  Don't let them get away with this.
[01:42:50.455 --> 01:42:51.776]  Don't let them hide the truth.
[01:42:52.216 --> 01:42:55.558]  And don't let the people that were behind it not pay.
[01:42:55.738 --> 01:43:00.521]  Every nation and every region now has a decision to make.
[01:43:01.901 --> 01:43:03.002]  Either you're with us,
[01:43:04.479 --> 01:43:05.717]  Or you were with the terrorists?
[01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:08.410]  Governor Bush!
[01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.890]  How we doing?
[01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:09.230]  Good to see you.
[01:43:09.250 --> 01:43:09.611]  Alright, good.
[01:43:09.651 --> 01:43:09.951]  How you doing?
[01:43:10.711 --> 01:43:15.473]  I was wondering, would you be in favor of seeing the 28 pages that have been redacted from the 9-11 commission report?
[01:43:15.493 --> 01:43:16.773]  Would you be the one to see those released?
[01:43:16.793 --> 01:43:18.374]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[01:43:18.434 --> 01:43:19.094]  Got them?
[01:43:19.114 --> 01:43:23.496]  When I dream of my wedding day, I will carry his picture and wish he were there with me.
[01:43:23.716 --> 01:43:24.516]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[01:43:24.576 --> 01:43:24.816]  Got them?
[01:43:25.416 --> 01:43:27.517]  My son's dead.
[01:43:28.838 --> 01:43:31.039]  And I don't know all the facts.
[01:43:31.419 --> 01:43:32.219]  Yeah, I'd like to see them.
[01:43:32.279 --> 01:43:32.879]  Got them?
[01:43:32.939 --> 01:43:37.321]  Keeping it a secret about those who facilitated it must end now.
[01:43:38.402 --> 01:43:40.467]  Well, hopefully we can get them.
[01:43:43.004 --> 01:43:49.767]  Now, coming up in the next segment, I'm going right back to your calls for folks who are patiently holding Leandra, Aaron, Kirby, Debbie, and others.
[01:43:49.787 --> 01:43:56.749]  But Les Jambesons, I guess I've probably known him for 14, 15 years, putting on 9-11 events, citizen journalists, doing investigations.
[01:43:56.769 --> 01:44:03.852]  He's been working since October 2015 to spearhead an effort to generate grassroots support for legislation, releasing 28 pages.
[01:44:04.432 --> 01:44:10.675]  HR14.org is the website we've had, obviously, Congressman Walter Jones as its senator during the report.
[01:44:11.655 --> 01:44:13.796]  On a lot of other folks breaking that down.
[01:44:13.836 --> 01:44:18.719]  Sebald Edmonds, who actually heard the NSA chatter, the transcripts of what really happened.
[01:44:19.099 --> 01:44:23.921]  Criminal elements of our government are working with Saudi Arabia and with jihadis.
[01:44:23.981 --> 01:44:27.483]  And look at what's happened with Obama now, funding it all into Syria.
[01:44:27.843 --> 01:44:32.506]  And they think that we're ignorant about this, and some people are, and they can get away with it.
[01:44:33.755 --> 01:44:36.798]  Now we have to have the CIA saying he may release some of it or all of it next week.
[01:44:37.639 --> 01:44:41.903]  What are you expecting to happen next week from all your sources and following this, Les Jamieson?
[01:44:41.963 --> 01:44:43.605]  And where do you think this is going to go?
[01:44:43.625 --> 01:44:46.908]  I mean, obviously, some people will say, hey, it's a lot more than that.
[01:44:46.968 --> 01:44:48.170]  Bombs in the buildings, everything else.
[01:44:48.210 --> 01:44:48.950]  Yeah, we get that.
[01:44:49.691 --> 01:44:56.572]  But, if you prove there's a cover-up and a stand-down on 9-11, that blows the door open for the whole investigation.
[01:44:56.612 --> 01:45:03.014]  It's like, you know, finding a guy with one dead kid in the back of his car, now you get a search warrant to go into the basement where there's 20 dead kids.
[01:45:03.274 --> 01:45:08.695]  The point is, we've got a dead kid in the car, we got this guy pulled over, and he's got splaying to do.
[01:45:08.755 --> 01:45:09.255]  Right, Les?
[01:45:10.795 --> 01:45:12.476]  Yeah, exactly right, Alex.
[01:45:12.556 --> 01:45:14.256]  Thank you so much for having me on today.
[01:45:14.956 --> 01:45:18.457]  I think a great illustration of the value of the 28 pages
[01:45:19.710 --> 01:45:32.778]  To the overall investigation of 9-11, which needs to be conducted, is a recent Rasmussen Report poll that came out 15 days after the 60 Minutes piece.
[01:45:32.898 --> 01:45:40.963]  So they had 15 days to survey the thoughts and the attitudes of Americans.
[01:45:41.643 --> 01:45:45.025]  Well, in this report, 74% of Americans want everything
[01:45:48.444 --> 01:45:53.643]  He classified about 9-11 and only a quarter feel that they've been told the total truth.
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:55.240]  About 9-11.
[01:45:55.420 --> 01:46:04.782]  So 75% know that we've been either lied to, misled, and deprived of all the facts and details.
[01:46:05.062 --> 01:46:05.882]  That's huge!
[01:46:06.162 --> 01:46:20.605]  So, the 28 pages has had, I think, an immense value, and I've seen this building, Alex, the pressure building, especially since December, with efforts in Congress to get more and more co-sponsors
[01:46:21.312 --> 01:46:33.521]  Then, late March, there was an article written by Jersey Widow Kristen Breitweiser, published in the Huffington Post, called Obama of Arabia.
[01:46:34.141 --> 01:46:49.151]  Absolutely scathing article about the fact that this government continues to suppress and protect the interests of Saudi Arabia over the concerns and the needs and the interests of the American people and, of course, the 9-11 families.
[01:46:50.563 --> 01:47:09.787]  So, then the 60 Minutes piece came out on the 10th of April, and since then, it has been an unbelievable display of high-profile news coverage that's pretty much wall-to-wall, just about saturation coverage.
[01:47:10.507 --> 01:47:16.928]  And the controversy is unbelievable, where now we have John Brennan, Director of the
[01:47:17.967 --> 01:47:25.894]  And Tom Keene and Lee Hamilton kind of reversing their earlier positions in which they favored release the 28 pages.
[01:47:26.495 --> 01:47:36.023]  And so we have also the Obama White House kind of trying to downplay the value of the 28 pages completely.
[01:47:37.404 --> 01:47:43.147]  Uh, 180 degrees opposite from the statement of, uh, the 9-11 commissioner.
[01:47:43.167 --> 01:47:48.130]  Well, they said they wanted the 28 pages from the congressional report release and there was a cover-up going on, 6 of the 10.
[01:47:48.170 --> 01:47:51.191]  Well, that shows the major pressure, the threats that are being made.
[01:47:51.251 --> 01:47:54.913]  But the good news is everybody's learning about stand-downs, about Saudi Arabia.
[01:47:55.113 --> 01:47:57.654]  People are going, hey, that's the country where 15 of them came from.
[01:47:57.934 --> 01:47:58.975]  Why'd we attack Iraq?
[01:47:59.375 --> 01:48:04.419]  I mean, really, regardless, they're losing in the court of public opinion whether they cover up or not.
[01:48:04.459 --> 01:48:10.844]  And Saudi Arabia threatening us to pull $850 billion a few weeks ago and, you know, acting so suspicious.
[01:48:11.224 --> 01:48:17.549]  And the fact that people know that ISIS is just al-Qaeda and the West is funding it as their jihad army, pretty stabilization on us.
[01:48:17.949 --> 01:48:21.292]  I mean, this is really an exciting time to see the truth come out.
[01:48:21.872 --> 01:48:28.254]  Now we've gone from false flag terrorism and inside job being in unknown terms to being ubiquitous out there.
[01:48:28.294 --> 01:48:46.098]  I mean, I think this is evidence that citizen journalists, the whistleblowers that get the real credit in the government and other areas, and the families and activists and in countless others, and Walter Jones, the congressman hammering in on this broadcast, and our audience, millions of people taking action, Drudge Report linking to it.
[01:48:46.558 --> 01:48:47.399]  It's not about credit.
[01:48:47.419 --> 01:48:48.419]  The point is the people
[01:48:49.179 --> 01:48:50.100]  Yes, yes, very dramatic.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.741]  And, well, I think also we're witnessing that within Congress
[01:49:15.819 --> 01:49:28.967]  We have Walter Jones, you know, Steve Lynch, Thomas Massey, and then some new faces that have come forth supporting the effort to release the 28 pages, which is very dramatic.
[01:49:29.007 --> 01:49:36.571]  For instance, Bob Sherman of Colorado, who's a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
[01:49:37.732 --> 01:49:39.993]  You know, let me add one or two more here.
[01:49:40.053 --> 01:49:41.094]  Devin Nunes.
[01:49:42.028 --> 01:49:48.750]  Who is very much kind of a hawk, warmonger, if you hear his interviews on TV.
[01:49:49.050 --> 01:49:59.192]  However, this is significant because he has come out favoring the release of the 28 pages, and Alex, he's the head of the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:50:00.093 --> 01:50:09.695]  And anybody who wants to, within Congress, gain access to read the 28 pages has to put in a request to that House Intelligence Committee.
[01:50:10.591 --> 01:50:14.840]  And so there are many very, very dramatic things going on.
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:18.387]  Thomas Drake, NSA whistleblower, has come forth.
[01:50:18.587 --> 01:50:19.209]  Sure, we've had him on.
[01:50:20.835 --> 01:50:22.417]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:22.977 --> 01:50:30.325]  Constitutional attorney Bruce Fine has written a couple of excellent articles about the need for Congress to release the 28 pages.
[01:50:30.345 --> 01:50:40.334]  The truth is, this has given 9-11 Truth a giant opening to expose this whole underworld of the left working with radical Wahhabi Saudi Arabians.
[01:50:42.636 --> 01:50:50.861]  Captain Caveman craziness and it's a very, very exciting time to be alive and we look to see what gets released next week.
[01:50:50.901 --> 01:50:52.162]  Les Jamieson, thank you so much.
[01:50:52.182 --> 01:50:53.823]  HR14.org.
[01:50:54.763 --> 01:50:55.744]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:55.824 --> 01:50:56.224]  Stay with us.
[01:50:56.244 --> 01:50:57.425]  I'm going right to your phone calls.
[01:50:57.625 --> 01:50:58.425]  Right to your phone calls.
[01:50:58.846 --> 01:51:00.747]  Debbie and Leandra and others, stay with us.
[01:51:03.166 --> 01:51:04.528]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:51:04.808 --> 01:51:06.129]  You can't survive without it.
[01:51:06.289 --> 01:51:07.210]  But where do you get it?

[01:51:13.497 --> 01:51:19.223]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:51:19.403 --> 01:51:36.256]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:51:36.656 --> 01:51:38.777]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:51:39.137 --> 01:51:40.338]  Stainless steel construction.

[01:52:02.768 --> 01:52:03.769]  BrainForce is here.
[01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:06.592]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:52:06.853 --> 01:52:14.681]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:52:15.461 --> 01:52:19.024]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[01:52:19.044 --> 01:52:21.405]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:52:21.765 --> 01:52:25.268]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:52:25.328 --> 01:52:28.470]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:52:28.971 --> 01:52:33.734]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:52:34.294 --> 01:52:36.136]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[01:52:36.476 --> 01:52:40.899]  That is activated by the different compounds in the yerba mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:52:41.059 --> 01:52:43.080]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:52:43.701 --> 01:52:45.162]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:52:45.302 --> 01:52:45.562]  Exactly.
[01:52:45.582 --> 01:52:49.365]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:52:49.865 --> 01:52:57.130]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:53:02.677 --> 01:53:04.098]  My name is Alex Jones.
[01:53:04.599 --> 01:53:10.543]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:53:10.743 --> 01:53:24.915]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights,
[01:53:25.515 --> 01:53:27.417]  You're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[01:53:27.837 --> 01:53:35.643]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[01:53:35.863 --> 01:53:42.948]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[01:53:43.289 --> 01:53:48.993]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[01:53:49.133 --> 01:53:55.318]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[01:53:55.558 --> 01:53:59.801]  Check them out today at Infowarslife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[01:54:00.041 --> 01:54:18.554]  Some of the new articles up on Infowars.com.
[01:54:20.075 --> 01:54:24.859]  Obama threatens public schools, enact tranny bathrooms, or lose funding.
[01:54:26.107 --> 01:54:26.827]  Don't be fooled.
[01:54:27.768 --> 01:54:30.329]  Politician Obama couldn't care less about individual rights.
[01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:36.551]  It's about creating confusion so they can talk to your elementary school students and say, maybe you're a man, maybe you're a woman.
[01:54:37.371 --> 01:54:42.593]  Take your parental rights away and convince your 10-year-old son to chop his genitals off.
[01:54:44.014 --> 01:54:52.577]  And by the way, most of the people that end up having their genitals cut off later say they got pressured into it by a cult and that they're very upset about it.
[01:54:53.118 --> 01:54:53.878]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:54:55.540 --> 01:54:58.422]  Now if you want to do it and you like it, I'm not, whatever!
[01:54:59.442 --> 01:55:04.786]  The point is it shouldn't be reading, writing, and arithmetic, not how to have your Johnson cut off.
[01:55:06.747 --> 01:55:09.789]  Not reading, writing, arithmetic, and how to have your genitals cut off.
[01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:13.111]  That's not what the schools are.
[01:55:14.072 --> 01:55:20.696]  The government shouldn't be talking to seven-year-olds about having two mommies or two daddies, because everybody needs to be comfortable with it.
[01:55:22.312 --> 01:55:23.092]  Another report here.
[01:55:23.152 --> 01:55:24.793]  Trump's wall no different than Ellis Island.
[01:55:24.813 --> 01:55:25.693]  We're going to get to all of this.
[01:55:25.713 --> 01:55:26.713]  There's so much to cover.
[01:55:26.753 --> 01:55:28.373]  I've got a bunch of news I want to get to.
[01:55:29.574 --> 01:55:30.654]  Dealing with Obamacare.
[01:55:30.694 --> 01:55:34.515]  People are really finding out what an overall bad deal that is.
[01:55:34.555 --> 01:55:36.575]  Not a bad deal for the foreign banks and insurance companies though.
[01:55:36.875 --> 01:55:37.855]  They're in there quite nicely.
[01:55:38.215 --> 01:55:43.236]  We have the guy that did the joke Hitler dog video that got arrested from Scotland joining us.
[01:55:44.437 --> 01:55:45.257]  Oh yeah, that's coming up.
[01:55:46.988 --> 01:55:48.589]  One of the heroes of Benghazi joining us.
[01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:49.930]  Talk about the ordered stand down.
[01:55:49.950 --> 01:55:50.451]  This is big.
[01:55:50.791 --> 01:55:54.814]  But Debbie and Leandra and Suzette and Kirby and Aaron.
[01:55:54.834 --> 01:55:56.495]  I'm going to get to all of you before the guests come on.
[01:55:56.975 --> 01:55:58.557]  Let's go to Leandra in Oklahoma.
[01:55:58.577 --> 01:55:59.657]  Thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:56:01.479 --> 01:56:01.699]  Yes.
[01:56:01.759 --> 01:56:02.139]  Hello.
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:11.566]  I was calling because there's been like a lot of chatter like on your show and on coast to coast about Trump wanting to choose Mary Fallin for like his running mate or whatever.
[01:56:12.327 --> 01:56:15.329]  And I think personally that's like a horrible choice.
[01:56:16.954 --> 01:56:22.957]  She just recently, like this past week, vetoed an informed consent bill, which was bill number 3016.
[01:56:23.077 --> 01:56:30.461]  Our prisons are running at 122% because we're at max capacity.
[01:56:31.381 --> 01:56:35.083]  And our budget is like $1.3 billion deficit.
[01:56:35.964 --> 01:56:44.268]  And I don't know, in the school of the establishment or whatever, I would just say she's maybe not at the cool table, but she's still one of them.
[01:56:45.342 --> 01:56:47.484]  And I was just kind of wanting to relay that to y'all.
[01:56:48.104 --> 01:56:49.866]  Well, doesn't everybody want to be at the cool table?
[01:56:50.646 --> 01:56:54.009]  Well, I will look more into the Republican governor of Oklahoma.
[01:56:54.029 --> 01:57:09.821]  I think the idea is to get a smart, you know, more conservative woman as his VP to try to neutralize the gimmick, you know, that Hillary's a woman, so it's okay that she's gotten a hundred million dollars from sheiks and people that, you know, turn women into total slaves in the Middle East.
[01:57:09.881 --> 01:57:10.942]  But I do get your point.
[01:57:10.982 --> 01:57:12.163]  We will investigate it more.
[01:57:13.558 --> 01:57:20.541]  Speaking of that, the Republicans in the Senate have approved a budget 200 plus billion dollars, bigger than what Obama even asked for.
[01:57:20.561 --> 01:57:27.223]  In fact, it's 261 million bigger, but the budget is in the hundreds of billions.
[01:57:27.243 --> 01:57:29.364]  I'm going to get to all that coming up right now.
[01:57:29.424 --> 01:57:30.504]  Thank you, Leandra.
[01:57:30.524 --> 01:57:31.344]  We'll investigate it.
[01:57:32.165 --> 01:57:34.125]  Debbie in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:57:34.145 --> 01:57:34.446]  Welcome.
[01:57:35.826 --> 01:57:36.306]  Hey, Alex.
[01:57:36.946 --> 01:57:41.148]  I just wanted to let you know that the silver bullet saved my mom's life.
[01:57:42.071 --> 01:57:49.777]  She was hospitalized in mid-March around the same time Merle Haggard had gotten ill when they had seen a lot of chemtrails in the sky.
[01:57:50.577 --> 01:57:54.480]  She had gone to the doctor and then two days later fell seriously ill.
[01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:56.321]  They had to rush her to the hospital.
[01:57:57.282 --> 01:58:04.728]  She had a really bad lung disorder and the hospital said they didn't think she'd make it out alive.
[01:58:04.908 --> 01:58:06.589]  She was literally in there for five days.
[01:58:07.614 --> 01:58:12.378]  By the third day, I rushed my sister up there with Silver Bullet, because I'm not in the same state.
[01:58:13.439 --> 01:58:17.743]  And my sister started giving her double doses of the recommended dose.
[01:58:18.343 --> 01:58:25.149]  My mother is now home, doing better, on oxygen, but they didn't think she would leave the hospital.
[01:58:27.151 --> 01:58:32.636]  Wow, you know, two and a half years ago, my uncle died, his son died, got the same stuff.
[01:58:32.696 --> 01:58:34.917]  It was a misery illness killing thousands in East Texas.
[01:58:36.170 --> 01:58:37.851]  Um, stay there ma'am.
[01:58:37.871 --> 01:58:38.751]  I'm going to come back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:38.811 --> 01:58:41.812]  I want to tell you our personal story with what happened.
[01:58:42.112 --> 01:58:44.713]  And then by the time they were already dead, we're like, we better take a little silver.
[01:58:44.733 --> 01:58:46.013]  My dad was sick from visiting him.
[01:58:47.034 --> 01:58:50.535]  Three rounds of antibiotics wouldn't help him, but the coital silver, we believe, knocked it out.
[01:58:50.575 --> 01:58:50.835]  Stay there.
[01:58:52.921 --> 01:59:01.947]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:59:02.027 --> 01:59:10.113]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:59:10.413 --> 01:59:15.114]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:59:15.294 --> 01:59:21.996]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:22.076 --> 01:59:29.158]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:59:29.238 --> 01:59:36.120]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:40.641]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:59:40.761 --> 01:59:44.022]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:59:44.142 --> 01:59:50.283]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:59:50.443 --> 01:59:52.664]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:54.884 --> 01:59:57.505]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:08.819 --> 02:00:10.479]  It's one o'clock central.
[02:00:10.519 --> 02:00:11.860]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.121]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:16.641 --> 02:00:17.821]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.381 --> 02:00:25.603]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:25.643 --> 02:00:30.764]  The pathwine of this song is when the hitman comes.
[02:00:32.184 --> 02:00:33.624]  He knows that he's been cheated.
[02:00:34.624 --> 02:00:36.625]  Because he's killing a member of his own family.
[02:00:42.742 --> 02:00:44.904]  Is the money really worth it to sell out humanity?
[02:00:46.966 --> 02:00:48.728]  Are you really betting on the right side?
[02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:54.093]  Only being honorable will fulfill you.
[02:00:54.133 --> 02:00:54.874]  Nothing else will.
[02:00:56.356 --> 02:00:59.679]  When the bullet hits the bone.
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:00.860]  All right.
[02:01:01.641 --> 02:01:02.822]  I want to go back to Debbie.
[02:01:02.962 --> 02:01:05.565]  Look, I want to be very, very clear about this, the way the laws work in this country.
[02:01:06.894 --> 02:01:09.735]  You should consult a physician before you drink pure spring water.
[02:01:09.795 --> 02:01:12.836]  You should consult a physician before you inhale oxygen into your lungs.
[02:01:13.476 --> 02:01:15.976]  You should consult a physician before you walk in the park.
[02:01:16.516 --> 02:01:22.238]  You should consult a physician because they're God and the FDA's God and they decide what you can and can't do.
[02:01:23.818 --> 02:01:27.319]  And they're trying to say that you can't say vitamin C is essential.
[02:01:27.619 --> 02:01:28.779]  If you don't have it, you will die.
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:29.520]  That's a fact.
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:31.900]  It's a known fact.
[02:01:31.940 --> 02:01:33.241]  Like if you don't have oxygen, you'll die.
[02:01:33.281 --> 02:01:34.441]  But they don't want you saying that either.
[02:01:35.478 --> 02:01:42.681]  I couldn't sell cans of oxygen to scuba divers and say, you need this to live when you're underwater.
[02:01:42.941 --> 02:01:44.842]  They would say that's a medical claim, I can't say it.
[02:01:45.322 --> 02:01:46.163]  So I agree with them.
[02:01:48.344 --> 02:01:51.225]  I can't tell you that oxygen is needed or that water is needed to live on this planet.
[02:01:52.045 --> 02:01:53.286]  I'd be racist if I did tell you that.
[02:01:54.887 --> 02:01:55.707]  Knowledge is racist.
[02:01:56.407 --> 02:01:58.008]  I can't tell you 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:01:59.089 --> 02:01:59.729]  It's whatever they say.
[02:02:01.109 --> 02:02:04.150]  I can't tell you, you know, the flu vaccines are known to kill people, even though the insert says it.
[02:02:04.190 --> 02:02:05.650]  Actually, I will say that, and I can tell you that.
[02:02:06.831 --> 02:02:08.511]  They'd like us to believe we don't have any speech.
[02:02:08.571 --> 02:02:08.931]  We do.
[02:02:09.231 --> 02:02:12.032]  But I'm not going to make claims about any of the products in Infowarslife.com.
[02:02:12.072 --> 02:02:15.433]  I mean, some of them are patented ingredients, like the BioPQQ and stuff.
[02:02:15.453 --> 02:02:20.955]  We can say whatever we want, because it's studied, it's proven, it's fact, it's basically a pharmaceutical that's still over the counter.
[02:02:22.555 --> 02:02:27.577]  But when it gets to, like, Loyal Silver, antibiotics don't work on everything, neither does silver.
[02:02:28.437 --> 02:02:30.718]  It depends on the pathogen, the bacteria, you name it.
[02:02:32.492 --> 02:02:36.154]  So, I don't want to sit up here and say it's some panacea and make a medical claim.
[02:02:36.214 --> 02:02:36.595]  I'm not.
[02:02:37.355 --> 02:02:41.197]  I know that I had a bad eye infection this week and I went, you know what?
[02:02:41.658 --> 02:02:42.318]  I've had this a day.
[02:02:42.958 --> 02:02:43.799]  I'm about to go to the doctor.
[02:02:43.819 --> 02:02:44.980]  I'm going to put a little silver in it.
[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:47.101]  Within hours, half the redness was gone.
[02:02:47.301 --> 02:02:49.022]  By the night time, 90% was gone.
[02:02:49.562 --> 02:02:50.603]  The pain was gone in hours.
[02:02:50.983 --> 02:02:53.104]  The bacteria or whatever it was stopped eating my eye, I believe.
[02:02:54.305 --> 02:03:00.149]  Now, my dad got sick taking care of my uncle and others and it killed him.
[02:03:01.365 --> 02:03:07.428]  And my dad kept taking antibiotics, and I'm like, Dad, and this is before we were even selling coiled silver, it's the very same stuff we probably labeled.
[02:03:08.689 --> 02:03:09.810]  He said, I'm going to get better, I'm going to get better.
[02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:10.991]  He's still trying to go to work and stuff.
[02:03:11.511 --> 02:03:15.213]  And I poured, and I don't say do this because this is a toxic amount.
[02:03:15.453 --> 02:03:16.394]  I'm just being honest with what I did.
[02:03:16.454 --> 02:03:17.474]  You said you took double the amount.
[02:03:17.494 --> 02:03:18.435]  Somebody's already going to die.
[02:03:18.735 --> 02:03:20.376]  Hospital's telling you, I mean, whatever.
[02:03:20.396 --> 02:03:22.737]  You know, desperate times take desperate measures.
[02:03:22.897 --> 02:03:24.038]  I'm not saying, dude, that's what I did.
[02:03:24.138 --> 02:03:25.619]  I made him drink two bottles in a week.
[02:03:26.789 --> 02:03:27.069]  I don't know.
[02:03:42.054 --> 02:03:43.615]  Was in super good shape, didn't take anything.
[02:03:44.335 --> 02:03:48.318]  So, I don't think we can say that your aunt was, you know, fixed by this known antibiotic.
[02:03:48.698 --> 02:03:51.280]  I'm just saying, it's part of the arsenal.
[02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:53.681]  More and more mainline science is trying to come out with it.
[02:03:53.721 --> 02:03:55.042]  Hospitals are starting to use it.
[02:03:55.622 --> 02:03:58.244]  But it's so inexpensive, Big Pharma hates it.
[02:03:58.264 --> 02:04:00.765]  But ma'am, finishing your story, Debbie, I appreciate your call.
[02:04:00.805 --> 02:04:01.386]  Finish your story.
[02:04:03.967 --> 02:04:05.288]  Well, that basically was it.
[02:04:05.308 --> 02:04:09.871]  She's doing better, but I also give the colloidal silver to my pets when they're not well.
[02:04:10.447 --> 02:04:12.733]  My neighbor's pet had a UTI.
[02:04:12.773 --> 02:04:17.165]  She couldn't afford a vet appointment, so I gave her a bottle and it cured her dog.
[02:04:18.456 --> 02:04:22.758]  Silver is extremely toxic to bacteria, and it's known to knock out a lot of viruses.
[02:04:22.778 --> 02:04:25.699]  I mean, it's just, it's very, it's very serious stuff.
[02:04:25.739 --> 02:04:30.161]  And it's supposedly in low dosages, isn't bad on the body, but high dosages, I mean, it's toxic.
[02:04:30.921 --> 02:04:32.381]  I'd like it to chemotherapy, really.
[02:04:32.401 --> 02:04:33.742]  You know, it's like bug poison.
[02:04:33.782 --> 02:04:36.763]  Yeah, it'll kill cells, it'll kill cancer, it'll hurt other stuff.
[02:04:36.783 --> 02:04:40.325]  But silver's a lot milder than that, obviously, but I just don't want to say it's a panacea.
[02:04:40.685 --> 02:04:44.646]  There are some folks that think, but I mean, hey, when other stuff isn't working, isn't it great God gave us silver?
[02:04:45.727 --> 02:04:46.267]  Absolutely.
[02:04:47.199 --> 02:04:48.641]  Well, thank you, ma'am, for that info.
[02:04:48.701 --> 02:04:50.202]  I really appreciate that testimony.
[02:04:50.223 --> 02:04:51.344]  You wanted to comment on the TSA.
[02:04:51.364 --> 02:04:52.785]  If you can hold, that's fine.
[02:04:52.825 --> 02:04:53.847]  But I have a guest popping in.
[02:04:53.887 --> 02:04:55.068]  I'll get you on, or you can go.
[02:04:55.128 --> 02:04:57.891]  But thank God for your aunt, and thank God she's better.
[02:04:57.911 --> 02:04:58.912]  That's very exciting news.
[02:04:59.253 --> 02:05:00.835]  Silver Bullet at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:05:02.825 --> 02:05:04.685]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[02:05:04.765 --> 02:05:06.406]  This is a Hillary Clinton ad from 2008.
[02:05:06.566 --> 02:05:09.026]  It's 3 a.m.
[02:05:09.106 --> 02:05:10.827]  and your children are safe and asleep.
[02:05:11.507 --> 02:05:14.667]  But there's a phone in the White House and it's ringing.
[02:05:14.747 --> 02:05:16.108]  Something's happening in the world.
[02:05:16.128 --> 02:05:17.668]  Hello, Secretary Clinton.
[02:05:17.848 --> 02:05:19.388]  This is Ambassador Stevens.
[02:05:19.408 --> 02:05:21.489]  We are under attack here in Benghazi.
[02:05:21.529 --> 02:05:22.309]  Hello?
[02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:23.469]  Hey, shut up.
[02:05:23.509 --> 02:05:25.870]  Your vote will decide who answers that call.
[02:05:25.970 --> 02:05:26.790]  Bob, what time is it?
[02:05:27.550 --> 02:05:28.471]  So, it's 3 a.m.?
[02:05:28.851 --> 02:05:35.637]  Whether it's someone who already knows the world's leaders, knows the military, someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous war.
[02:05:35.897 --> 02:05:36.818]  Oh, cool, she should answer.
[02:05:36.838 --> 02:05:37.818]  She said she would.
[02:05:37.878 --> 02:05:38.819]  Hello, we're under attack!
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:40.520]  The building's on fire!
[02:05:41.061 --> 02:05:42.062]  They're shooting at us!
[02:05:42.362 --> 02:05:43.122]  There's explosions!
[02:05:43.142 --> 02:05:45.144]  Where the f*** are you?
[02:05:45.184 --> 02:05:47.106]  You said you were gonna answer!
[02:05:47.146 --> 02:05:48.687]  Come on, Secretary Clinton!
[02:05:48.887 --> 02:05:49.788]  We need you!
[02:05:50.088 --> 02:05:51.229]  Don't leave us!
[02:05:51.289 --> 02:05:54.051]  It's 3 a.m., and your children are safe and asleep.
[02:05:54.071 --> 02:05:56.413]  Who do you want answering the phone?
[02:05:56.693 --> 02:05:58.974]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:05:59.194 --> 02:06:01.254]  I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
[02:06:04.095 --> 02:06:09.077]  Caitlyn Jenner experienced sex change regret might de-transition, biographer says.
[02:06:09.337 --> 02:06:10.917]  It hasn't been easy for Caitlyn.
[02:06:11.057 --> 02:06:12.058]  It's been very hard.
[02:06:12.078 --> 02:06:17.819]  Ian Halperin recalls one source telling him, well, you are a dude dressed like a lady.
[02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:19.300]  Dude looks like a lady!
[02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:25.501]  Caitlin Jenner, who announced her transition from man to woman last year, has considered de-transitioning.
[02:06:25.681 --> 02:06:29.802]  The author of a new book about the Kardashian family told The Wrap on Wednesday.
[02:06:30.022 --> 02:06:41.785]  Ian Halperin, the author of Kardashian Dynasty, the controversial rise of America's royal family, thanks to all you crazy leftists who want to ban freedom, have made these kind of people celebrities.
[02:06:41.945 --> 02:06:42.425]  Thank you.
[02:06:42.805 --> 02:06:46.469]  One source confirmed to me Caitlyn has made whispers of sex change regret.
[02:06:46.650 --> 02:06:48.071]  You didn't even change sex.
[02:06:48.131 --> 02:06:50.334]  You're a guy with a dress on.
[02:06:50.454 --> 02:06:51.956]  Get with the program, dude.
[02:06:51.996 --> 02:06:53.057]  You're delusional.
[02:06:53.217 --> 02:06:57.262]  Put on some shorts, get a tank top, eat some Wheaties, and go for a jog.
[02:06:57.402 --> 02:06:59.124]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:05.184]  We could have saved Navy SEALs in Benghazi.
[02:07:05.344 --> 02:07:09.210]  F-16 pilots in Italy were on standby to help besiege U.S.
[02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:12.555]  forces in Libya, but the order to launch never came.
[02:07:12.795 --> 02:07:13.296]  A U.S.
[02:07:13.416 --> 02:07:19.024]  Air Force source has claimed that a squadron of attack jets was being armed and fueled on the night of the deadly attack.
[02:07:19.184 --> 02:07:30.289]  On the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, the jets, believed to be F-16s, were on the runway ready to launch, as terrorists bombarded the U.S.
[02:07:30.329 --> 02:07:32.730]  consulate, killing four Americans.
[02:07:32.931 --> 02:07:44.756]  The source claims the fighters could have launched from Aviano Air Force Base in northern Italy and refueled at Naval Air Station Sigonella before providing air support over Benghazi.
[02:07:44.956 --> 02:07:47.998]  And yet, all we hear is Hillary Clinton saying,
[02:07:48.638 --> 02:07:50.580]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:56.284]  She is the most vile, un-American human being to ever live.
[02:07:56.404 --> 02:07:58.866]  She is pure evil in the flesh.
[02:07:59.106 --> 02:08:01.768]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:08:09.013 --> 02:08:09.754]  Big Brother.
[02:08:10.614 --> 02:08:12.336]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:13.917 --> 02:08:14.998]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:16.503 --> 02:08:17.423]  You want answers?
[02:08:18.384 --> 02:08:19.384]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:20.325 --> 02:08:26.607]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:30.889 --> 02:08:37.972]  If you haven't seen the blasphemous criminal evil, we're going to play a short clip of it coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:08:38.032 --> 02:08:39.052]  Our guest will be gone then.
[02:08:39.072 --> 02:08:41.493]  At the bottom of the hour, we'll continue with your phone calls.
[02:08:43.054 --> 02:08:45.015]  Mark Meakin joins us.
[02:08:46.246 --> 02:08:52.831]  He's an online gamer, streamer, YouTuber, and leader of the so-called Dank Brigade.
[02:08:54.052 --> 02:08:57.714]  And I see hammers and sickles and stuff on his YouTube side.
[02:08:57.734 --> 02:09:02.037]  I don't know if that means he thinks Mao Zedong's cute or Lenin's cute or whatever.
[02:09:03.118 --> 02:09:05.060]  But he describes himself as a liberal.
[02:09:05.340 --> 02:09:07.301]  And that kind of comes off watching some of his videos.
[02:09:07.341 --> 02:09:08.062]  And they're funny.
[02:09:08.502 --> 02:09:09.383]  He's a talented guy.
[02:09:09.883 --> 02:09:13.926]  You know, John Cleese made skits making fun of Adolf Hitler of Monty Python fame.
[02:09:15.899 --> 02:09:21.721]  We have Charlie Chaplin famously with his short film, The Dictator, making fun of Hitler, dressed up as Hitler.
[02:09:22.962 --> 02:09:24.042]  We have Disney doing it.
[02:09:24.762 --> 02:09:27.263]  But this guy isn't allowed to do it.
[02:09:28.044 --> 02:09:29.284]  The police came and arrested him.
[02:09:32.765 --> 02:09:37.687]  Mark Meakin again joins us, I believe he's in Scotland, he can tell me where he's at.
[02:09:38.387 --> 02:09:42.149]  But I know it was all over, it's in Scotland, that's where the cops went and arrested him, came to his house.
[02:09:44.068 --> 02:09:49.211]  And just the media with a straight face said, yeah, you don't make a video with your pug doing the Hitler salute.
[02:09:49.951 --> 02:09:56.075]  I made a video three years ago when they were banning the JCPenney teapot because someone thought it looked like Hitler.
[02:09:56.215 --> 02:09:59.117]  It's a silver colored teapot with a black handle.
[02:10:00.317 --> 02:10:02.499]  Looks nothing like Hitler, but someone could see it.
[02:10:02.519 --> 02:10:05.120]  Like if you see Hitler in a cloud, do you ban that?
[02:10:05.761 --> 02:10:09.663]  And so I pointed out that my French Bulldog captain looks like he has a Hitler mustache.
[02:10:13.137 --> 02:10:14.338]  Will I be arrested?
[02:10:15.980 --> 02:10:17.281]  And if you're a TV viewer, there it is.
[02:10:18.142 --> 02:10:19.783]  The Hitler dog, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:19.883 --> 02:10:23.387]  And again, Captain doesn't mean it that he looks like Hitler.
[02:10:23.847 --> 02:10:25.609]  The question is, why did I pick him as a puppy?
[02:10:25.649 --> 02:10:27.791]  Maybe that shows my subconscious love for Hitler.
[02:10:28.251 --> 02:10:32.115]  Maybe I should be taken and interrogated like 1984 until I tell the truth.
[02:10:32.175 --> 02:10:34.257]  I mean, this is meant to be over the top.
[02:10:35.882 --> 02:10:50.470]  This is meant to where they can ban any speech they want, whenever they want, while our governments bring in radical jihadists, while they allow all these other disparate groups to come in and spew whatever anti-semitic garbage, whatever they want.
[02:10:50.490 --> 02:10:55.713]  And quite frankly, I say if you're a citizen of a country, you got free speech, you can say it, as long as you don't hurt somebody.
[02:10:59.670 --> 02:11:09.715]  But will there be purges of people that maybe look like Hitler, or their dog looks like Hitler, or maybe people keep seeing Mary or Jesus in bagels and danishes.
[02:11:10.615 --> 02:11:14.257]  If someone sees Hitler maybe in vines growing on your house, will you be arrested?
[02:11:15.798 --> 02:11:18.199]  And by the way, I'm not joking.
[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:21.041]  That's what this is.
[02:11:22.702 --> 02:11:25.323]  With the teapot and JCPenney, it's reaching that level.
[02:11:27.022 --> 02:11:30.284]  Where now people say, hey let's get Mexicans, don't say the word Mexican.
[02:11:30.684 --> 02:11:32.585]  Or let's go get Chinese, don't say Chinese.
[02:11:32.765 --> 02:11:34.046]  I've seen it in Austin.
[02:11:34.266 --> 02:11:35.327]  People shouted down.
[02:11:36.488 --> 02:11:37.889]  Knowledge is now criminal.
[02:11:38.369 --> 02:11:39.469]  Just like homosexual.
[02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:40.570]  They say that's a hateful word.
[02:11:40.890 --> 02:11:43.452]  Robin Page, the BBC, was actually arrested a decade ago.
[02:11:44.132 --> 02:11:45.533]  A host of one man and his dog.
[02:11:46.113 --> 02:11:50.436]  Because he said rural communities deserve the same rights as homosexuals and Mexicans.
[02:11:51.997 --> 02:11:53.558]  Or Muslims or anybody else.
[02:11:53.598 --> 02:11:55.079]  He listed a whole group of people.
[02:11:58.993 --> 02:12:01.317]  And ladies and gentlemen, because he said homosexual, he was arrested.
[02:12:01.718 --> 02:12:02.359]  Heterosexual.
[02:12:02.399 --> 02:12:02.900]  Homosexual.
[02:12:03.421 --> 02:12:05.204]  Even if something's hurtful, you should be able to say it.
[02:12:05.504 --> 02:12:06.546]  But Facebook says no.
[02:12:06.806 --> 02:12:08.189]  So that's where all this is going.
[02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:09.771]  To shut down free speech.
[02:12:09.811 --> 02:12:11.354]  Not to stop radicals or whatever.
[02:12:11.815 --> 02:12:12.576]  Or extremists.
[02:12:13.390 --> 02:12:19.853]  We're going to go to our guest here in a moment, but first here's Paul Watson commenting on the viral video from Mark Meekin.
[02:12:20.153 --> 02:12:24.656]  We'll also give you his YouTube channel and more if you want to see the thought crimes for yourself.
[02:12:24.676 --> 02:12:27.617]  But since then, tens of millions of views, hundreds of articles.
[02:12:28.898 --> 02:12:31.459]  And I was reading, he said he was sorry.
[02:12:31.839 --> 02:12:33.820]  I want to hear still if he thinks he's bad.
[02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:34.861]  I don't think he's bad.
[02:12:35.141 --> 02:12:36.382]  I think Mark's a funny guy.
[02:12:37.421 --> 02:12:39.703]  He may have bad taste in politics, but hey, that's his right.
[02:12:40.123 --> 02:12:42.724]  We're gonna talk to him in a moment, but here's Paul Watson breaking it down.
[02:12:42.744 --> 02:12:50.489]  28-year-old Marcus Meacham was arrested for hate crimes after posting this joke video of his girlfriend's dog reacting to Nazi slogans.
[02:12:50.709 --> 02:12:56.453]  My girlfriend is always ranting and raving about how cute and adorable her wee dog is.
[02:12:57.554 --> 02:13:03.357]  And so I thought I would turn him into the least cute thing that I could think of, which is a Nazi.
[02:13:05.139 --> 02:13:05.439]  Buddha!
[02:13:06.377 --> 02:13:07.239]  Try gas to juice.
[02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:09.703]  Gas to juice.
[02:13:09.723 --> 02:13:10.524]  Gas to juice.
[02:13:10.564 --> 02:13:10.845]  Juice.
[02:13:10.865 --> 02:13:11.706]  See you Kyle!
[02:13:11.746 --> 02:13:11.947]  Juice.
[02:13:29.344 --> 02:13:34.731]  The video went viral, receiving 18,000 thumbs up to just 1,200 thumbs down.
[02:13:34.811 --> 02:13:44.483]  The vast majority of viewers thought that it was hilarious, but thanks to a small minority of perpetually offended retards, Meechan got a home visit from the Scotsman.
[02:13:44.523 --> 02:13:45.284]  And then he got arrested.
[02:13:45.384 --> 02:13:47.646]  Alright, let's stop Paul's video right there.
[02:13:47.766 --> 02:13:50.549]  And again, Paul is pronouncing his name Meechan like I did.
[02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:52.050]  It's Meechan is how he likes it pronounced.
[02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:53.832]  And Mark Meechan joins us.
[02:13:53.912 --> 02:13:57.615]  Mark, I tell you, I don't know if I can be associating with somebody like you.
[02:13:57.635 --> 02:14:00.838]  I mean, you've got a guy, Fox Mask, behind you too.
[02:14:00.858 --> 02:14:04.701]  If you kind of cut off the handlebar mustache and only left the middle, that'd be Hitler as well.
[02:14:05.262 --> 02:14:08.305]  Do you want to... I mean, are you really sad for what you did?
[02:14:08.325 --> 02:14:08.965]  Are you really sorry?
[02:14:11.670 --> 02:14:14.392]  I feel in the long run I didn't do anything wrong.
[02:14:14.932 --> 02:14:16.753]  It was clearly satire.
[02:14:16.773 --> 02:14:17.794]  It was clearly a joke.
[02:14:18.054 --> 02:14:20.996]  I wasn't setting out to cause any hurt or offence to any people.
[02:14:21.076 --> 02:14:22.657]  If anything I was wanting people to laugh.
[02:14:23.698 --> 02:14:25.919]  Just obviously it was taken the wrong way.
[02:14:26.519 --> 02:14:27.340]  That was all really.
[02:14:29.802 --> 02:14:30.962]  Maybe you are a bad person.
[02:14:30.982 --> 02:14:32.703]  Maybe John Cleese should be arrested.
[02:14:32.743 --> 02:14:36.306]  Have you seen him do his Hitler spoofs that I think are probably you could say more distasteful than yours?
[02:14:37.622 --> 02:14:44.965]  Yeah, I've seen the joke where he actually, you know, done the whole moustache thing and he even goose stepped out the room and things like that as well.
[02:14:45.485 --> 02:14:46.485]  I've seen all the jokes like that.
[02:14:46.505 --> 02:14:50.587]  I've seen various jokes in relation to, you know, Nazis, Jews and things like that as well.
[02:14:50.627 --> 02:14:55.468]  But it doesn't matter if England and the UK fought Hitler, now you've got to take on Hitler's mantle.
[02:14:55.708 --> 02:14:57.369]  Do you want to apologize for Hitler right now?
[02:14:59.310 --> 02:15:01.110]  It's not my duty to apologize for Hitler.
[02:15:01.330 --> 02:15:03.731]  You know, it wasn't my fault or anything like that.
[02:15:03.751 --> 02:15:05.432]  Do you want to apologize for Jar Jar Binks?
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:08.822]  No, I don't need to apologise for that, no.
[02:15:10.003 --> 02:15:11.163]  You are wearing a Star Wars shirt.
[02:15:12.084 --> 02:15:13.005]  Yeah, I am, yeah.
[02:15:13.265 --> 02:15:15.226]  I'm not a Jar Jar Binks fan myself, no.
[02:15:15.707 --> 02:15:18.729]  That's because you're racist against Caribbean lizards?
[02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:23.104]  Uh, no, I'm not racist against Caterpie and Littles, I don't know.
[02:15:23.965 --> 02:15:26.407]  Well, alright, now we're starting to watch you a little closer.
[02:15:26.647 --> 02:15:27.969]  Actually, we may be onto something here.
[02:15:28.209 --> 02:15:31.512]  Getting serious, describe what the police did, what ended up happening.
[02:15:31.532 --> 02:15:32.994]  I mean, did they have straight faces?
[02:15:33.054 --> 02:15:36.798]  I mean, how could they watch your pug horrified by Hitler?
[02:15:37.999 --> 02:15:39.821]  I mean, that's a cute pug, by the way.
[02:15:40.221 --> 02:15:42.464]  I mean, what's the issue here?
[02:15:43.930 --> 02:15:45.631]  Well, they came to my house.
[02:15:46.231 --> 02:15:48.673]  As soon as they arrived, they said, I'm sure you know why we're here.
[02:15:48.813 --> 02:15:52.374]  They explained why they were here and everything and I let them in.
[02:15:52.594 --> 02:15:57.717]  They explained the situation, that it's being classed as a hate crime, and then they just basically said, well, we're here to arrest you.
[02:15:58.838 --> 02:16:05.461]  They let me get changed and stuff like that, but while I was getting changed, they were going around my house, they were taking photos of everything in my house.
[02:16:06.101 --> 02:16:07.142]  And stuff like that as well.
[02:16:07.182 --> 02:16:10.724]  They were, like, taking photos of, like, the wall behind me and everything like that as well.
[02:16:10.804 --> 02:16:12.966]  Are they like social justice warriors themselves?
[02:16:12.986 --> 02:16:15.908]  They thought they had, like, a thought criminal on their... I mean, how were they behaving?
[02:16:15.928 --> 02:16:16.829]  Were they taking this serious?
[02:16:17.791 --> 02:16:21.114]  They were taking it serious, yeah.
[02:16:21.134 --> 02:16:28.060]  Some of the things that they were saying to me as well was one of the officers felt that the video could actually promote hatred towards Jews.
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:37.448]  They thought it actually promoted Nazi culture and they feel it could actually inspire people to hate Jews instead of just see it as a piece of satire, which is what it was.
[02:16:38.129 --> 02:16:47.103]  Have you heard, it's actually in mainstream news, that they're now hiring former Stasi commanders in Germany to list people criticizing open borders and the German police are arresting them?
[02:16:47.824 --> 02:16:48.805]  This is starting to get scary.
[02:16:49.767 --> 02:16:49.967]  Yeah.
[02:16:50.990 --> 02:16:59.359]  Yeah, it's just that I understand that there are certain things that we actually have to arrest people for and certain things that should be regarded as crimes.
[02:16:59.899 --> 02:17:02.882]  I don't think hurting someone's feelings is a crime.
[02:17:03.403 --> 02:17:04.724]  It's not a crime in any sense.
[02:17:04.844 --> 02:17:09.229]  No, it's never been under common law, Magna Carta, or anything else in the West, but in Saudi Arabia it is.
[02:17:09.309 --> 02:17:13.173]  If a woman goes out without a hood on her head, they can kill her because that hurts her husband's
[02:17:13.954 --> 02:17:15.675]  The left seems to ally with those folks.
[02:17:16.456 --> 02:17:17.437]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:17:17.918 --> 02:17:18.859]  Where are you now?
[02:17:18.879 --> 02:17:19.739]  Are you still charged?
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:21.501]  Are they still proud of themselves?
[02:17:21.561 --> 02:17:23.363]  Are they going to arrest John Cleese?
[02:17:23.543 --> 02:17:24.644]  Is there an arrest warrant out for him?
[02:17:25.512 --> 02:17:29.454]  No, as far as I know, the police haven't spoken to me since then.
[02:17:29.494 --> 02:17:32.135]  I was arrested, I was kept in jail overnight.
[02:17:32.495 --> 02:17:34.736]  I was kept in jail for court for the next day.
[02:17:35.776 --> 02:17:42.939]  Just before I was due to go to court, I was granted what's called Procurator Fiscal Liberation, which means the Procurator Fiscal decided to release me.
[02:17:43.179 --> 02:17:44.380]  This can either be a case of
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:47.882]  They didn't feel like they had enough evidence to actually bring the charge against them.
[02:17:47.902 --> 02:17:50.023]  Well sure, but sir, that's a false arrest.
[02:17:50.523 --> 02:17:56.287]  And under Magna Carta Common Law and the Scottish Constitution, you are due serious restoration.
[02:17:56.327 --> 02:18:05.252]  This is a civil rights violation, and if you don't... See, the reason people in the UK are so bullied is you're so friendly, you're so nice, and you represent them for everybody's rights, sir.
[02:18:05.312 --> 02:18:10.155]  I think you really should bring legal action against them, because there aren't thought crimes last time I checked.
[02:18:11.983 --> 02:18:17.768]  Um, well, I thought that as well, but obviously until all this, you know... No, I mean, it's the police that need to be arrested!
[02:18:18.108 --> 02:18:18.609]  Seriously!
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:24.203]  A lot of people were kind of finding it funny because the police thought the video itself was offensive.
[02:18:24.223 --> 02:18:27.685]  They thought it was going to promote, you know, hatred of Jewish people and things like that as well.
[02:18:28.065 --> 02:18:33.529]  But instead, all the arrest did was actually drew even more and more attention towards the video itself.
[02:18:34.029 --> 02:18:37.251]  Like, because ever since the arrest... Yeah, obviously, I mean, are you out to get Jews?
[02:18:37.291 --> 02:18:39.492]  I mean, even if you were, it's your free speech, but I mean, are you out to get Jews?
[02:18:39.513 --> 02:18:41.414]  I mean, you come off as a big leftist on your site.
[02:18:42.219 --> 02:18:43.859]  No, I don't hate anyone.
[02:18:43.939 --> 02:18:46.780]  I don't hate any creed or race or anything like that at all.
[02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:50.261]  I mean, it's very stylish in Trendyville, and I'm not saying you're a bad guy.
[02:18:50.281 --> 02:18:53.562]  You are very funny, trendy, and you're an extra talented guy, to be outrageous, correct?
[02:18:53.602 --> 02:18:54.862]  I mean, that's kind of the style right now.
[02:18:55.682 --> 02:18:58.043]  Shock comedy is kind of what I do.
[02:18:58.063 --> 02:18:59.463]  I make a lot of offensive jokes.
[02:18:59.543 --> 02:19:02.964]  I laugh about terrible things and stuff like that as well, but it is all satire.
[02:19:03.004 --> 02:19:04.104]  I don't really... No, I get it.
[02:19:04.124 --> 02:19:06.085]  I mean, that's all the rage in any big comedy club.
[02:19:06.820 --> 02:19:07.961]  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.
[02:19:08.342 --> 02:19:12.807]  It kind of seems, though, you actually need to have your job listed as comedian, though, to, you know, get away with it.
[02:19:16.091 --> 02:19:22.158]  Well, we're going to go out to break here with just a clip of John Cleese again committing thought crimes far worse than yours, Imani Python.
[02:19:22.178 --> 02:19:25.161]  And I'm calling for the Scottish police to put a warrant out for John Cleese.
[02:19:25.201 --> 02:19:25.522]  Here it is.
[02:19:27.094 --> 02:19:30.698]  ...as hate speech, then my entire channel is hate speech.
[02:19:30.899 --> 02:19:37.145]  It's getting close to where I'm going to have to leave the country simply to continue to make YouTube videos.
[02:19:37.306 --> 02:19:41.791]  They're already arresting people who criticize Muslim immigration on Twitter.
[02:19:41.831 --> 02:19:42.572]  Now satire!
[02:19:43.172 --> 02:19:48.134]  Frigging satire that's not even malicious will not be tolerated.
[02:19:48.254 --> 02:19:50.274]  And this is by no means a one-off case.
[02:19:50.454 --> 02:19:57.977]  Just a few days ago, a Muslim police chief in Manchester said, freedom of speech does not mean freedom of offending culture, religion, or tradition.
[02:19:58.017 --> 02:20:03.218]  So let's stop there and back it up to Cleese, because they showed the video for TV viewers, but I want to play it for radio listeners as well.
[02:20:03.498 --> 02:20:04.679]  And John Cleese has come out and said,
[02:20:05.539 --> 02:20:08.780]  You can't go to a college campus or even on TV and say anything now.
[02:20:09.781 --> 02:20:14.843]  And that's what Seinfeld's daughter came and said, how dare you say you're moving back to New York so I can meet more boys.
[02:20:15.283 --> 02:20:16.564]  Men and women together is bad.
[02:20:18.165 --> 02:20:21.446]  And he thought she was really stupid until he found out, no, that's what they're teaching.
[02:20:21.766 --> 02:20:23.167]  Male, female, he, she.
[02:20:23.447 --> 02:20:24.107]  Don't say it.
[02:20:24.167 --> 02:20:26.888]  Someone else might not be a he or a she.
[02:20:27.288 --> 02:20:31.850]  Well, okay, but I'm allowed to be a he or a she or whatever I want.
[02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:32.891]  You could be a five-foot
[02:20:33.956 --> 02:20:38.259]  You know, black woman and think you're a seven foot Chinese jet pilot from Pluto.
[02:20:39.700 --> 02:20:41.381]  But it doesn't make it real.
[02:20:41.421 --> 02:20:43.223]  But listen, I don't hate you because...
[02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:46.870]  You think you're a 7-foot Chinese jet pilot from Pluto?
[02:20:47.371 --> 02:20:49.632]  The point is, I'm going to be able to say you're crazy.
[02:20:50.312 --> 02:20:59.617]  It's like the woman who had the state pay to have Drano dumped in her eyes, and they had all these people on the British television thinking it was great.
[02:21:00.298 --> 02:21:05.761]  This is in the US, but they show it there and go, she has courage, she blinded herself, and now the taxpayer pays for it.
[02:21:06.341 --> 02:21:08.903]  Any mental illness is now being promoted as good.
[02:21:08.923 --> 02:21:13.046]  The other is, pouring drain cleaner in your eyes, the next trendy social justice movement.
[02:21:13.326 --> 02:21:22.493]  Now, I should be able to say, and it's my opinion, but let me tell you, it's my opinion, 2 plus 2 equals 4, that this woman is an absolute freakazoid nutcase that wants attention!
[02:21:23.794 --> 02:21:33.362]  And I realize more and more in this new trendy thing, where you've got to be a victim, women especially, men commit most of the armed robberies and rapes, we're going to our guest in a moment, I'm just making these points to what he says,
[02:21:34.326 --> 02:21:40.811]  But in criminology, women make stuff up, lie on average more than men, and will claim they're victims of things that didn't happen.
[02:21:41.511 --> 02:21:50.778]  They'll say horrible things happened to them, just so they can go to court, and it's proven none of it's true, but they don't care because they've got 10 other girlfriends there in the audience feeling sorry for them.
[02:21:51.078 --> 02:21:52.599]  It's drama queen behavior.
[02:21:53.159 --> 02:21:58.803]  Listen, if you want to dump Drano in your nice fruitcake, you need to be locked up, because you're going to hurt yourself.
[02:21:59.364 --> 02:22:01.846]  People that used to hurt themselves, we put them in rubber rooms.
[02:22:03.248 --> 02:22:08.950]  Now I gotta pay for you to chop your Johnson off or to pour Drano in your eyes.
[02:22:10.090 --> 02:22:14.832]  And the new movement is whether nuggets or whatever, they cut their arms and legs off and live in a box and wear diapers.
[02:22:15.292 --> 02:22:18.513]  I ain't paying for you to live in a diaper with your arms and legs chopped off!
[02:22:18.913 --> 02:22:20.794]  You need to be in a fricking rubber room!
[02:22:21.074 --> 02:22:23.575]  Let's play the John Cleese clip and go back to our thought criminal friend.
[02:22:24.275 --> 02:22:25.055]  Who's this then?
[02:22:25.816 --> 02:22:26.776]  Stop you!
[02:22:26.856 --> 02:22:31.618]  I'll do that for you all!
[02:22:35.953 --> 02:22:40.099]  He would have also been hit with hate crimes charges for this Monty Python sketch.
[02:22:52.609 --> 02:22:54.810]  Oh yeah, Charlie Chaplin.
[02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:55.250]  No, no, no, no.
[02:22:55.290 --> 02:22:58.311]  Let's put the pro-Hitler Jew up who should be arrested too.
[02:22:58.371 --> 02:22:59.891]  Of course he's not, but it doesn't matter.
[02:22:59.911 --> 02:23:01.272]  Let's arrest Charlie Chaplin.
[02:23:01.292 --> 02:23:01.532]  Here it is.
[02:23:08.632 --> 02:23:10.073]  That's right, and anybody can be offended.
[02:23:10.113 --> 02:23:11.434]  This is a political takeover.
[02:23:11.494 --> 02:23:15.537]  Isn't the real fascist threat the folks that want to control language, sir?
[02:23:15.637 --> 02:23:19.000]  Again, the thought criminal that created Hitler Dog, Mark Meakin.
[02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:21.582]  And Mark, how do we visit your website, your YouTube?
[02:23:21.602 --> 02:23:23.724]  What are some of the other thought crimes you're engaged in?
[02:23:25.379 --> 02:23:26.680]  Um, nothing really.
[02:23:26.740 --> 02:23:29.200]  I just kind of wanted to make people laugh.
[02:23:29.260 --> 02:23:29.861]  That was all.
[02:23:29.881 --> 02:23:32.261]  Just me and my friends just like making stupid videos.
[02:23:32.622 --> 02:23:38.083]  Most of them are all just sort of inside jokes between ourselves and we didn't think people would find it funny but apparently they do.
[02:23:38.744 --> 02:23:40.724]  And it's just all sort of blew up from there.
[02:23:41.204 --> 02:23:44.546]  That was all it was really and didn't really want to commit any thought crimes.
[02:23:44.566 --> 02:23:45.126]  No, I get it.
[02:23:45.166 --> 02:23:49.287]  Around the office our form of entertainment is inside jokes which no one else would understand.
[02:23:49.767 --> 02:23:51.108]  But aren't those the best types of jokes?
[02:23:52.011 --> 02:23:52.932]  Yeah, they are.
[02:23:53.493 --> 02:23:54.734]  I mean, I find them funny.
[02:23:54.774 --> 02:23:59.879]  I thought maybe other people would find them funny or, you know, I didn't really set out to offend anyone or anything like that.
[02:23:59.899 --> 02:24:01.060]  Just sadly, that's what happened.
[02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:06.386]  But it seems that it was only a very, very small, you know, minority of people that were actually offended.
[02:24:06.706 --> 02:24:13.393]  And it's just, for someone to actually be arrested for hurting someone's feelings is, yeah, yeah, it's absurd.
[02:24:13.933 --> 02:24:15.075]  Well, tell us the name of your channel.
[02:24:16.132 --> 02:24:17.133]  I say Count Dankula.
[02:24:17.153 --> 02:24:18.934]  That's the name of the channel, yeah.
[02:24:19.294 --> 02:24:22.256]  Not, not, not Count Dracula, but Count Dankula.
[02:24:22.896 --> 02:24:24.337]  Yeah, Count Dankula, yeah.
[02:24:24.737 --> 02:24:27.859]  Now, let me ask you the really serious question, uh, Mark Meakin.
[02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:30.381]  Is the dog the Holy One?
[02:24:30.981 --> 02:24:32.883]  Now, you'll say I'm worshipping Hitler, it's a joke, folks.
[02:24:33.663 --> 02:24:34.884]  Is the dog around?
[02:24:34.904 --> 02:24:38.166]  Uh, the dog is here, just next to me, yeah.
[02:24:38.186 --> 02:24:40.047]  May I please see, will you please put it in your lap?
[02:24:40.948 --> 02:24:42.309]  Yeah, no problem.
[02:24:43.369 --> 02:24:44.270]  What's the name of Hitler dog?
[02:24:45.296 --> 02:24:46.137]  His name's Buddha.
[02:24:47.798 --> 02:24:48.498]  Oh my gosh.
[02:24:48.538 --> 02:24:49.999]  Is that a boy or a girl?
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:51.320]  He's a boy.
[02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:53.822]  A lot of folks don't like pugs.
[02:24:53.902 --> 02:24:54.703]  I really like him.
[02:24:55.924 --> 02:24:58.005]  Yeah, he's a lovely dog, yeah.
[02:24:58.045 --> 02:25:01.388]  Now, do you think that dog's having pro-Hitler thoughts right now, or is he thinking about food?
[02:25:02.629 --> 02:25:03.569]  He's thinking about food.
[02:25:03.649 --> 02:25:05.631]  That's why he did the salute and everything.
[02:25:05.691 --> 02:25:07.492]  It was so he could get a treat.
[02:25:07.512 --> 02:25:08.833]  Can we get a Hitler salute right now?
[02:25:08.853 --> 02:25:09.894]  Or are you going to arrest it again?
[02:25:12.123 --> 02:25:12.943]  Now see, you're scared.
[02:25:12.963 --> 02:25:15.485]  John Cleese can do it, and the BBC can.
[02:25:15.545 --> 02:25:17.146]  Valti Towers can, but you can't.
[02:25:17.786 --> 02:25:19.287]  So is freedom 2 plus 2 equals 4?
[02:25:19.467 --> 02:25:22.509]  Or is freedom the right to have your pug salute Hitler?
[02:25:23.170 --> 02:25:31.835]  Which he isn't saluting Hitler, but he's simulating a fascist salute for school children to educate them about the horrors of the Nazis that controlled what people could say and do.
[02:25:32.636 --> 02:25:34.017]  Oh, I've heard of this before.
[02:25:35.762 --> 02:25:41.805]  Well, it's just a case of any kind of restriction on free speech in any way is probably one of the most dangerous things to mankind.
[02:25:41.845 --> 02:25:46.386]  But you are scared to have... Ask the dog about Hitler, come on.
[02:25:47.067 --> 02:25:47.867]  You're afraid, see?
[02:25:48.007 --> 02:25:48.867]  But we're seeing it, folks.
[02:25:49.908 --> 02:25:53.509]  Charges can still be brought against me even though I was liberated, so I'm just kidding.
[02:25:53.549 --> 02:25:54.490]  Let me do it from the United States.
[02:25:54.810 --> 02:25:56.411]  Let me do it from the United States.
[02:25:56.431 --> 02:25:57.711]  What are some of the key words for the dog?
[02:25:58.772 --> 02:26:00.572]  What do I say to the dog?
[02:26:00.632 --> 02:26:02.873]  Basically, if I say... Well, I might do it.
[02:26:03.113 --> 02:26:03.634]  Gas the Jews.
[02:26:04.694 --> 02:26:11.116]  Uh, to be like... And then you've trained it that it gets food when you do that, right?
[02:26:11.736 --> 02:26:13.236]  Uh, yeah, that's what he thinks it is, yeah.
[02:26:13.396 --> 02:26:18.117]  And of course, there's nothing funny about what Hitler did, but, you know, the point is, is that we fought Hitler.
[02:26:18.297 --> 02:26:23.538]  But if we were Germans, we should be able to make a joke, because that's what it's all about, is how ridiculous it is.
[02:26:24.859 --> 02:26:26.079]  It is kind of ridiculous.
[02:26:26.139 --> 02:26:27.880]  It definitely shouldn't have got to this stage.
[02:26:27.900 --> 02:26:29.780]  Look, no one wants to... Gassy Jews?
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:32.141]  No, no.
[02:26:32.181 --> 02:26:32.841]  Dog can't hear me?
[02:26:32.901 --> 02:26:33.361]  Dog can't hear me?
[02:26:33.381 --> 02:26:33.881]  Can the dog hear me?
[02:26:34.972 --> 02:26:36.454]  I think the dog can't probably hear you.
[02:26:36.514 --> 02:26:37.935]  Oh my god, that is a cute dog.
[02:26:37.955 --> 02:26:39.397]  That dog doesn't get kisses, does it?
[02:26:40.378 --> 02:26:43.461]  Well, my girlfriend, she loves him.
[02:26:43.761 --> 02:26:45.463]  She loves him loads.
[02:26:45.643 --> 02:26:46.284]  Is that her baby?
[02:26:46.304 --> 02:26:47.605]  Yeah.
[02:26:48.286 --> 02:26:50.088]  She loves this dog more than she loves me.
[02:26:50.948 --> 02:26:51.469]  I believe it.
[02:26:52.010 --> 02:26:55.914]  Well, I already like the dog better than you, but seriously though, I'm joking.
[02:26:57.028 --> 02:26:58.730]  You know what I see as more offensive than Hitler Dog?
[02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:59.831]  And you have a right to put it up.
[02:27:00.051 --> 02:27:03.775]  The hammer and sickle has had about 180 million people been killed under it.
[02:27:04.495 --> 02:27:07.258]  Do you have hammers and sickles in some of your videos as a joke, which is your right?
[02:27:07.618 --> 02:27:09.040]  Or are you kind of feeling the burn?
[02:27:10.501 --> 02:27:14.205]  I haven't included like any hammers and sickles or anything like that.
[02:27:14.225 --> 02:27:16.207]  You know, that's something I could probably do one day.
[02:27:16.747 --> 02:27:19.109]  Then somebody else must have used one of your videos and I apologize.
[02:27:20.571 --> 02:27:21.492]  What is your political views?
[02:27:23.748 --> 02:27:27.050]  Political views are just basically, I do believe strongly in free speech.
[02:27:27.530 --> 02:27:29.552]  I do believe in free enterprise.
[02:27:29.892 --> 02:27:33.975]  I do believe in, you know, basically working very, very hard to make sure everyone's in employment.
[02:27:33.995 --> 02:27:35.536]  Oh, so you are evil.
[02:27:35.716 --> 02:27:37.337]  Okay, so they got you right.
[02:27:37.437 --> 02:27:38.378]  Good thing they arrested you.
[02:27:39.359 --> 02:27:40.760]  Sir, can we please see Hitler Dog again?
[02:27:40.780 --> 02:27:41.400]  I apologize.
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:42.741]  No, that's fine.
[02:27:42.761 --> 02:27:43.862]  Tell a treat, tell a treat.
[02:27:45.343 --> 02:27:45.803]  Right, okay.
[02:27:47.124 --> 02:27:49.046]  What does your dog think of Count Dankula?
[02:27:50.291 --> 02:27:53.572]  Um, I don't think he's any idea about the trouble he's actually caused.
[02:27:54.632 --> 02:27:58.513]  Anything like... Did the dogs... Did the police interrogate the dog?
[02:27:58.533 --> 02:27:59.233]  Did they question the dog?
[02:28:00.014 --> 02:28:00.434]  Oh no, no.
[02:28:00.454 --> 02:28:02.954]  They didn't bring the dog in or anything like that, no.
[02:28:04.055 --> 02:28:06.195]  You know, some people are now identifying as trans-species.
[02:28:06.235 --> 02:28:06.975]  Maybe that's not a dog.
[02:28:06.995 --> 02:28:10.576]  Maybe that's a jet pilot or maybe it's a nuclear physicist.
[02:28:10.736 --> 02:28:11.437]  Maybe that's a person.
[02:28:11.697 --> 02:28:13.417]  What if your dog starts identifying as a person?
[02:28:13.797 --> 02:28:16.298]  Could it be allowed to say, you know, drive an army tank or something?
[02:28:17.450 --> 02:28:20.154]  Um, I don't know, probably not, man.
[02:28:20.594 --> 02:28:28.224]  Well, brother, I really appreciate you spending time with us and resimulating the supposed crime that you committed, but I doubt they're going to be back again.
[02:28:28.244 --> 02:28:31.989]  Any other points you'd like to add, but just please keep the dog on screen for us.
[02:28:32.250 --> 02:28:32.510]  Yeah.
[02:28:33.471 --> 02:28:37.913]  It's just a case of freedom of speech is something that's absolutely crucial to civilisation.
[02:28:37.953 --> 02:28:39.534]  You need to be able to criticise everything.
[02:28:39.594 --> 02:28:47.557]  If people weren't allowed to do that, you wouldn't have had people uprising against brutal dictatorships or anything like that if people weren't allowed to freely express their views.
[02:28:47.577 --> 02:28:51.999]  It's something that is extremely important and it's paramount to a civilisation thriving.
[02:28:52.359 --> 02:28:53.839]  It's not something that should be oppressed.
[02:28:53.939 --> 02:28:56.701]  I mean, everything that's happened to me is something, you know, straight out of 1984.
[02:28:58.041 --> 02:29:01.823]  I made a joke and, you know, I was immediately arrested and things like that and it's just wrong.
[02:29:02.264 --> 02:29:04.225]  It shouldn't be a crime to hurt someone's feelings.
[02:29:04.905 --> 02:29:06.106]  That's pretty much it.
[02:29:06.566 --> 02:29:08.367]  I think your dog may be the cutest pug ever.
[02:29:09.147 --> 02:29:15.051]  What is the cue to get the dog to, let's say, down with Hitler and then perhaps you'll salute that and that'll make the police happier?
[02:29:16.612 --> 02:29:17.552]  Down with Hitler?
[02:29:17.772 --> 02:29:18.553]  Down with Hitler?
[02:29:21.797 --> 02:29:26.839]  I probably should try and teach him some other more politically correct tricks.
[02:29:42.759 --> 02:29:43.460]  Thanks very much.
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:44.061]  Cheers.
[02:29:44.361 --> 02:29:45.543]  Alright, there he goes, folks.
[02:29:45.563 --> 02:29:47.225]  Really nice chat there.
[02:29:47.245 --> 02:29:50.549]  And a good attitude about the whole thing.
[02:29:50.589 --> 02:29:51.711]  But I'm telling you, this is dangerous.
[02:29:51.731 --> 02:29:52.612]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.113 --> 02:29:54.695]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.715 --> 02:29:58.340]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.044 --> 02:30:05.985]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[02:31:04.374 --> 02:31:05.655]  You can't survive without it.
[02:31:05.856 --> 02:31:06.756]  But where do you get it?

[02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:05.071]  We could have saved Navy SEALs in Benghazi.
[02:32:05.251 --> 02:32:09.074]  F-16 pilots in Italy were on standby to help besiege U.S.
[02:32:09.154 --> 02:32:12.437]  forces in Libya, but the order to launch never came.
[02:32:12.677 --> 02:32:13.177]  A U.S.
[02:32:13.298 --> 02:32:18.882]  Air Force source has claimed that a squadron of attack jets was being armed and fueled on the night of the deadly attack.
[02:32:19.062 --> 02:32:30.164]  On the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, the jets, believed to be F-16s, were on the runway, ready to launch, as terrorists bombarded the U.S.
[02:32:30.224 --> 02:32:32.605]  consulate, killing four Americans.
[02:32:32.805 --> 02:32:44.627]  The source claims the fighters could have launched from Aviano Air Force Base in northern Italy and refueled at Naval Air Station Sigonella before providing air support over Benghazi.
[02:32:44.847 --> 02:32:47.868]  And yet, all we hear is Hillary Clinton saying,
[02:32:49.048 --> 02:32:50.449]  At this point, does it make?
[02:32:50.650 --> 02:32:56.135]  She is the most vile, un-American human being to ever live.
[02:32:56.295 --> 02:32:58.697]  She is pure evil in the flesh.
[02:32:58.977 --> 02:33:01.600]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:33:24.401 --> 02:33:28.904]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:28.944 --> 02:33:31.945]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.005 --> 02:33:36.548]  Rob Due, our news director, is real sick with the flu or something, but he's better now.
[02:33:36.588 --> 02:33:49.576]  But he's the guy that got this footage along with the rest of our great crew around the country getting exhausted in dozens of states following these social justice warriors that spit in your face, physically attack you, you name it.
[02:33:51.266 --> 02:33:59.770]  Whether it was in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, or whether it was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or whether it was in San Francisco, California, it doesn't matter.
[02:33:59.790 --> 02:34:03.232]  They would all run up and scream, you're an effing white male!
[02:34:03.252 --> 02:34:05.593]  And I hate to talk like that, but that's what they say.
[02:34:05.614 --> 02:34:10.816]  And it's like white women and white men are the ones that they walk over and they go, you don't get to talk.
[02:34:11.657 --> 02:34:13.097]  You're a white male.
[02:34:13.117 --> 02:34:15.779]  And of course, it's not lost on them.
[02:34:16.159 --> 02:34:17.740]  I guess they know that they're white too.
[02:34:19.858 --> 02:34:33.487]  And I'm not trying to, you know, social justice signal or whatever they call it when I kind of say the virtue signal when I say that I think the worst social justice warriors are white, usually.
[02:34:36.029 --> 02:34:39.031]  Because maybe they have the most white guilt and they've got something to prove.
[02:34:39.531 --> 02:34:41.893]  I don't know what it is, but these people are wild.
[02:34:44.218 --> 02:34:46.920]  And they are so incredibly stupid.
[02:34:47.260 --> 02:34:51.022]  Now, I didn't give this guy this nickname, Aiden Skrillex, but I don't know his real name.
[02:34:51.403 --> 02:34:52.864]  This is one of the biggest memes on the internet.
[02:34:53.804 --> 02:35:03.490]  But when you're out in public, screaming that folks don't have any right to speech, and all over the country people walk up with a camera and go, you are a white male, check your privilege, and shut up.
[02:35:05.191 --> 02:35:09.134]  We ought to just take a whole compilation of the, hey, you're a white male, shut up.
[02:35:11.089 --> 02:35:15.673]  And they'll be there with some blue-collar guy standing in line going, you're a privileged white male, and they're like, huh?
[02:35:15.693 --> 02:35:17.294]  You know, it's like Bernie Sanders.
[02:35:17.555 --> 02:35:19.777]  There are no poor white people in the world.
[02:35:20.237 --> 02:35:21.138]  Really, really.
[02:35:21.859 --> 02:35:28.905]  There are more than twice as many as there are black people, and you can argue there are more blacks per capita, and that's true, that are poor, and that should be worked on, obviously.
[02:35:29.525 --> 02:35:32.228]  But still, numbers double in the U.S.
[02:35:33.369 --> 02:35:33.669]  Double.
[02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:36.211]  Physically, in numbers.
[02:35:36.371 --> 02:35:37.793]  But they don't count, see, they're not human.
[02:35:38.476 --> 02:35:41.437]  But this isn't a Black vs. White or Hispanic vs. White deal.
[02:35:41.457 --> 02:35:42.738]  This is what the media is making it.
[02:35:43.198 --> 02:35:44.118]  Again, it's divide and conquer.
[02:35:44.138 --> 02:35:44.739]  And I know you know that.
[02:35:44.759 --> 02:35:50.841]  I'm going to go to Debbie, and I'm going to go to Suzette, and Kirby, and Aaron, and Tim right now.
[02:35:50.861 --> 02:35:55.603]  Here in just a moment, Tim listening on KEIB in California.
[02:35:55.623 --> 02:35:57.544]  We're going to go to him in just a moment.
[02:35:58.204 --> 02:36:00.665]  But before we do that, I wanted to play just Age Skrillex.
[02:36:00.885 --> 02:36:06.627]  That's the Internet's name for this unknown soldier of the Social Justice Warrior Guild.
[02:36:07.088 --> 02:36:07.768]  But here it is.
[02:36:08.285 --> 02:36:11.506]  You've never experienced oppression in your entire f***ing life!
[02:36:11.566 --> 02:36:13.226]  You're a f***ing white male!
[02:36:13.547 --> 02:36:18.148]  You're a f***ing white male!
[02:36:20.889 --> 02:36:21.969]  That's Carl the Cuck.
[02:36:22.469 --> 02:36:22.769]  Cluck.
[02:36:23.309 --> 02:36:27.731]  I mean, you can't get better entertainment than this.
[02:36:27.771 --> 02:36:29.791]  My son says the whole school watches these.
[02:36:30.692 --> 02:36:33.192]  And then I talk to other kids and they say this is all anyone watches.
[02:36:33.593 --> 02:36:34.813]  The left is in trouble, man.
[02:36:36.178 --> 02:36:39.319]  And by the way, I'm talking about so-called minority kids who are watching it.
[02:36:39.359 --> 02:36:40.999]  I mean, everyone cannot stand these people.
[02:36:42.499 --> 02:36:45.300]  I mean, it's crazy how dumb they are.
[02:37:22.978 --> 02:37:24.780]  Jack, Dallas Republican.
[02:37:25.140 --> 02:37:26.501]  You're on with Joan Kigenova.
[02:37:28.043 --> 02:37:29.004]  Hey Joe, how you doing?
[02:37:29.064 --> 02:37:29.985]  I'm Jack Strickland.
[02:37:30.005 --> 02:37:36.090]  The question I don't see being addressed is the abundance of references in her emails about AIDS skrillex.
[02:37:36.791 --> 02:37:39.774]  You're a white man!
[02:37:40.855 --> 02:37:41.516]  Sorry about that.
[02:37:41.556 --> 02:37:42.817]  We're going to go ahead and move on.
[02:37:48.013 --> 02:37:49.595]  I'm sorry, that's like a month old or whatever.
[02:37:49.655 --> 02:37:50.216]  I can't help it.
[02:37:50.236 --> 02:37:51.678]  I gotta watch it at least five times a day.
[02:37:51.698 --> 02:37:54.002]  I'm sorry.
[02:37:54.342 --> 02:37:55.544]  I have guilty pleasures.
[02:37:55.664 --> 02:37:59.510]  I kind of got past watching people who are dumb for entertainment.
[02:37:59.630 --> 02:37:59.791]  Man.
[02:38:01.075 --> 02:38:02.435]  These videos are just too luscious.
[02:38:03.076 --> 02:38:06.317]  Except when you realize they've got our kids, they've got our culture, they've taken over.
[02:38:06.337 --> 02:38:09.138]  And they don't want to thrive and build cities or have better science.
[02:38:09.158 --> 02:38:14.480]  They just want to run around pecking at everyone that they're evil and they're homophobic and they're bad.
[02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:17.821]  And you're just like, hey dude, I don't care what you do, just leave me alone.
[02:38:18.101 --> 02:38:18.641]  Shut up!
[02:38:18.661 --> 02:38:19.602]  You're a white male!
[02:38:23.403 --> 02:38:25.143]  Donald Trump wants a bunch of wars!
[02:38:25.664 --> 02:38:26.964]  Actually, he was against the Iraq War.
[02:38:27.444 --> 02:38:28.024]  Shut up!
[02:38:28.084 --> 02:38:29.045]  You're a white male!
[02:38:30.219 --> 02:38:31.380]  Obamacare doubles prices.
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:32.561]  Shut up, racists!
[02:38:33.581 --> 02:38:34.582]  Obama's coming for the guns.
[02:38:34.682 --> 02:38:35.683]  Shut up, racists!
[02:38:37.224 --> 02:38:37.944]  They've opened the borders.
[02:38:38.004 --> 02:38:38.705]  It's bankrupting.
[02:38:38.785 --> 02:38:39.805]  Shut up, racists!
[02:38:40.766 --> 02:38:42.167]  That's the new intellectual thing.
[02:38:42.187 --> 02:38:44.609]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[02:38:44.629 --> 02:38:45.329]  I'm going to shut up now.
[02:38:45.369 --> 02:38:46.930]  Speaking of shut up racists, we're going to go to Tim.
[02:38:47.851 --> 02:38:49.051]  And here in a second, but first, Debbie.
[02:38:49.071 --> 02:38:51.233]  And this one all along is Kirby.
[02:38:52.013 --> 02:38:53.454]  And Aaron, Suzette, and others.
[02:38:53.534 --> 02:38:55.256]  Debbie, thank you for holding from New Jersey.
[02:38:56.147 --> 02:38:56.988]  What about the TSA?
[02:38:57.008 --> 02:38:59.550]  I mean, I should kick that off and talk about the first hour.
[02:39:00.210 --> 02:39:11.500]  Up at the airport there in Chicago, four-hour waits, three-hour waits, mile-long lines, and the TSA holding us hostage saying, give us more money.
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:13.842]  We want some money, Lebowski!
[02:39:13.862 --> 02:39:17.365]  And I say, I can get you a tow by two o'clock with paint, you know.
[02:39:17.905 --> 02:39:18.325]  I'm sorry.
[02:39:18.806 --> 02:39:19.406]  Go ahead, Debbie.
[02:39:20.968 --> 02:39:23.890]  So I called in to Talk Radio, New Jersey 101.5 again.
[02:39:25.735 --> 02:39:30.398]  And the article was a TSA article, and it was discussing the abuse of power.
[02:39:30.878 --> 02:39:45.528]  So my comment was that the original jihad and fraud in chief, Hussein Obama, was flying in tens of thousands of illegals into the airports with no vetting, that we have no borders, and that we shouldn't be giving up our liberty for false security.
[02:39:46.248 --> 02:39:49.951]  So the host asked me, you know, who's your news source?
[02:39:50.882 --> 02:39:56.445]  And I was gonna say in four words, I did not because I did not want him to call me a conspiracy theorist.
[02:39:56.465 --> 02:39:56.665]  Sure.
[02:39:56.985 --> 02:39:58.385]  So I said, drudge report.
[02:39:59.586 --> 02:40:05.028]  So he said, wow, he says, um, they have a very, um, respected news crew there.
[02:40:05.849 --> 02:40:07.470]  They're a highly respected news source.
[02:40:07.530 --> 02:40:08.490]  And I said, yes, they are.
[02:40:09.410 --> 02:40:17.254]  So the following day I called in to the same show on an issue regarding the HUD, the section eight housing.
[02:40:18.054 --> 02:40:19.575]  And when they took my call,
[02:40:20.237 --> 02:40:29.040]  Uh, the kid asked me what my comment was, so I said, um, my comment is that, uh, they plan on putting all these new jihads in the Section 8 housing.
[02:40:29.220 --> 02:40:31.301]  And they said, oh, we're sorry, we can't take your call.
[02:40:32.861 --> 02:40:33.081]  Wow.
[02:40:33.161 --> 02:40:34.122]  I just found it amusing.
[02:40:34.142 --> 02:40:34.782]  Well, sure, sure.
[02:40:34.802 --> 02:40:36.963]  Ma'am, ma'am, let them call you a conspiracy theorist.
[02:40:36.983 --> 02:40:38.043]  That's a badge of honor.
[02:40:38.063 --> 02:40:39.343]  In fact, I meant to cover that today.
[02:40:39.383 --> 02:40:43.185]  I actually have written here, uh, the true definition of conspiracy theory.
[02:40:44.056 --> 02:40:51.686]  And then also I want to talk about the fact that this is Friday the 13th and the history of Friday the 13th, but I'll do that after our next guest leaves us and after we've taken calls.
[02:40:51.846 --> 02:41:01.479]  But the true definition of a conspiracy theorist is someone that studies history and knows that there are organized crime elements in inhuman
[02:41:02.796 --> 02:41:08.418]  community that always try to set up the same type of systems and they destroy civilization.
[02:41:08.478 --> 02:41:13.321]  So, a conspiracy theorist is someone that questions known liars and has studied history.
[02:41:13.681 --> 02:41:22.064]  The Bible, every history book warns of criminal conspiracies, combines, cults, groups that seek power that take control of civilization.
[02:41:22.865 --> 02:41:27.787]  Every fairy tale, every fable, everything children were warned about through stories
[02:41:28.911 --> 02:41:29.552]  Is about that.
[02:41:30.112 --> 02:41:33.595]  Because it happens over and over again, in fiction and in reality.
[02:41:34.175 --> 02:41:34.996]  It all mirrors.
[02:41:35.076 --> 02:41:38.899]  And now the last six years they said there is no corruption, there is no problems.
[02:41:39.199 --> 02:41:41.781]  Oh, there is in your town or city, but not at the top.
[02:41:42.122 --> 02:41:43.163]  There's nothing happening.
[02:41:44.023 --> 02:41:48.827]  And so you've got a media with a 6% trust rate trying to make you feel dumb.
[02:41:48.867 --> 02:41:54.452]  And by the way, he was being sarcastic, you know, because I guess you called in about the problem yesterday before it was big news when Drudge first linked to it.
[02:41:55.788 --> 02:41:58.211]  Oh, that's a big news source that did that, uh-huh.
[02:41:58.591 --> 02:42:01.094]  Because it was a citizen with a camera showing the giant line.
[02:42:01.394 --> 02:42:03.937]  Well, thank God the citizens are reporting to the people.
[02:42:04.838 --> 02:42:06.279]  We see something, we say something.
[02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:08.341]  So, local news wouldn't have covered that.
[02:42:08.562 --> 02:42:10.524]  That's now national news and local news.
[02:42:10.964 --> 02:42:11.905]  We forced it out.
[02:42:12.065 --> 02:42:12.886]  You forced it out.
[02:42:13.187 --> 02:42:14.088]  Drudge forced it out.
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:23.044]  It was six, seven years ago the whole TSA controversy started because Drudge almost every week would link to our articles and stuff people sent us of them searching kids and saying they weren't.
[02:42:23.444 --> 02:42:26.726]  And then letting Muslims through with full, you know, burqas on.
[02:42:27.366 --> 02:42:29.347]  So, who cares what news source it is?
[02:42:29.407 --> 02:42:33.069]  We show this line that takes 15 minutes to walk up.
[02:42:33.973 --> 02:42:42.418]  We show three, four hour longer waits, we show luggage piled up in huge parking lots, and we force them to cover it.
[02:42:42.458 --> 02:42:43.419]  That's what they can't stand.
[02:42:43.439 --> 02:42:46.941]  So they go, oh, Debbie, where'd you see that?
[02:42:48.042 --> 02:42:55.787]  Look, believe me, it has more credibility with the general public to say InfoWars.com or DrugsReport.com than it does to say CBS News.
[02:42:55.867 --> 02:42:57.808]  But regardless, regardless,
[02:42:59.201 --> 02:43:02.063]  It shows how desperate they are with 6% still trusting him.
[02:43:02.663 --> 02:43:06.586]  They're there to make you feel like you're alone, you're by yourself when you're the majority, man.
[02:43:07.206 --> 02:43:15.552]  So good job talking yesterday about the admitted TSA lines all over the country that are getting worse and worse, and they're totally horrible.
[02:43:15.852 --> 02:43:18.294]  And then they leave our borders open and fly aircraft in.
[02:43:18.394 --> 02:43:23.377]  New York Daily News, Associated Press, CBS, if you want to use those, have all reported.
[02:43:23.637 --> 02:43:28.821]  Planes land every day and the feds say, search no one's passports or IDs, let them in.
[02:43:29.881 --> 02:43:49.050]  But, see, the host thinks his listeners are dumb, so when you bring that up, he wants to giggle at you with his big voice and feel powerful over you, Debbie, because they've got talk radio on a one-inch leash now, and they're bringing in all this money for advertising from big conduits that don't even make money back on it, but to control the content.
[02:43:49.130 --> 02:43:49.690]  It is on.
[02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:52.492]  I have been told by affiliates everywhere that pressure is on.
[02:43:52.532 --> 02:43:54.613]  That's why, if you hear us on stations around the country,
[02:43:55.549 --> 02:43:59.590]  You need to support them because they're bucking the trend to shut down free speech, Debbie.
[02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:00.571]  God bless you.
[02:44:00.611 --> 02:44:01.531]  But you hit the nail on the head.
[02:44:01.571 --> 02:44:02.471]  Our borders are open.
[02:44:02.751 --> 02:44:04.712]  The Border Patrol completes the smuggling process.
[02:44:05.632 --> 02:44:07.133]  That's from the head of the Border Patrol Union.
[02:44:07.153 --> 02:44:07.853]  That's a quote.
[02:44:08.513 --> 02:44:10.134]  We're reporting the facts.
[02:44:10.494 --> 02:44:12.034]  They're bringing jihadis in.
[02:44:12.994 --> 02:44:13.855]  It's all a hoax.
[02:44:13.895 --> 02:44:14.615]  It's all a fraud.
[02:44:14.635 --> 02:44:20.097]  And now they want more funding for more naked body scanners and highway checkpoints when the border is wide open.
[02:44:20.137 --> 02:44:20.797]  That's like leaving
[02:44:22.284 --> 02:44:33.148]  That's like leaving your front door open and your bedroom door open, but then hiring an armed guard to randomly search people that try to enter your children's room at night.
[02:44:34.069 --> 02:44:35.629]  No, you just have an alarm and lock the door.
[02:44:35.689 --> 02:44:36.170]  It's crazy.
[02:44:36.210 --> 02:44:38.751]  But see, they want to make you pay for the armed guard.
[02:44:39.711 --> 02:44:42.492]  No, we're going to lock the door and we're going to have our own guns.
[02:44:43.212 --> 02:44:44.393]  See, they want the monopoly.
[02:44:44.573 --> 02:44:45.093]  God bless you.
[02:44:45.113 --> 02:44:45.593]  Great points.
[02:44:46.334 --> 02:44:47.614]  Who's been holding the most next?
[02:44:47.994 --> 02:44:49.455]  We'll go to Kirby and then to Tim.
[02:44:49.775 --> 02:44:51.376]  Kirby, you're on the air from California.
[02:44:51.416 --> 02:44:51.736]  Go ahead.
[02:44:52.861 --> 02:44:53.562]  Hi, Alex.
[02:44:53.822 --> 02:44:54.142]  Welcome.
[02:44:55.063 --> 02:44:57.405]  We, uh, you're our beloved Alex.
[02:44:57.545 --> 02:45:01.489]  Thank you so much for all the truth, because that's the knowledge and the power, yeah?
[02:45:01.949 --> 02:45:04.231]  Well, I mean, the last lady called in and said it better than I say it.
[02:45:04.271 --> 02:45:05.753]  I mean, a lot of this is pretty simple, you know?
[02:45:06.413 --> 02:45:09.196]  The border's wide open and they got checkpoints grabbing our genitals.
[02:45:09.256 --> 02:45:16.722]  I mean, that's about getting in our space like a dog urinating on another dog to let us know that we are dominated, we are slaves, we are over.
[02:45:16.802 --> 02:45:17.263]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:18.007 --> 02:45:21.309]  Yeah, children could understand it and they are our future.
[02:45:21.389 --> 02:45:23.070]  So here's the thing.
[02:45:23.090 --> 02:45:24.351]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:45:25.492 --> 02:45:27.373]  It's time for the gloves to come off.
[02:45:28.493 --> 02:45:29.174]  Absolutely.
[02:45:29.314 --> 02:45:30.755]  So the truth is out there.
[02:45:30.795 --> 02:45:32.016]  The knowledge has been out there.
[02:45:32.036 --> 02:45:36.118]  You look at sites like you guys and all your social media sites.
[02:45:36.278 --> 02:45:40.901]  My goodness, it's millions upon millions upon millions of viewers, right?
[02:45:42.313 --> 02:45:45.775]  Isn't that a beautiful thing, how many people you guys reach?
[02:45:46.156 --> 02:45:47.537]  And we're one small part of it, ma'am.
[02:45:47.837 --> 02:45:49.038]  You can start a YouTube too.
[02:45:49.078 --> 02:45:50.478]  You can start a radio blog.
[02:45:50.518 --> 02:45:53.420]  It's about everybody realizing what they have to say matters.
[02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:56.643]  You are just as important, Suzette, or Kirby.
[02:45:57.323 --> 02:45:59.064]  I've got a bunch of calls changing here on the screen.
[02:45:59.504 --> 02:46:01.125]  You are just as important
[02:46:02.246 --> 02:46:23.313]  As a New York Times writer, or a Washington Post writer, or a Daily Beast writer, and of course I'm stealing that from Matt Drudge, but he's, Matt, over the years has sent nice little notes to some of my writers, you know, saying, hey, you're just as important as a New York, I shouldn't tell Inside Baseball, but he didn't say, don't say this so I can say it, he's a very private guy, and he's tweeted stuff like this, but, you know, it's like Charlton Heston when he used to say,
[02:46:24.233 --> 02:46:26.796]  Hey, call me up if you ever need encouragement or want to talk.
[02:46:26.816 --> 02:46:27.597]  And I'm like, you're kidding.
[02:46:28.018 --> 02:46:30.020]  So I called it a few times a month later, didn't answer.
[02:46:30.060 --> 02:46:31.041]  Called one day, he answered.
[02:46:31.061 --> 02:46:32.202]  We talked like 35 minutes.
[02:46:32.523 --> 02:46:33.824]  He's been on the show, too, before he died.
[02:46:34.505 --> 02:46:35.886]  But he really cared about the future.
[02:46:35.927 --> 02:46:37.168]  He really cared about young people.
[02:46:37.188 --> 02:46:38.570]  He really cared about encouraging people.
[02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:41.193]  And, you know, Matt Dredge is sending nice notes to people going, hey,
[02:46:42.159 --> 02:46:43.800]  You know, be bold in what you're doing.
[02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:45.161]  You know, be proud of what you're doing.
[02:46:45.181 --> 02:46:50.624]  When Drudge has emailed somebody and they've said, really, I'm doing a good job or whatever, and he's like, yeah, you're just as important as the New York Times.
[02:46:50.964 --> 02:46:51.784]  Well, I go further.
[02:46:52.205 --> 02:46:54.806]  You as listeners are more important than the New York Times.
[02:46:55.026 --> 02:46:57.988]  They've proven themselves to spin and lie and deceive.
[02:46:58.708 --> 02:46:59.049]  Okay?
[02:46:59.949 --> 02:47:01.070]  You know you're for real.
[02:47:01.170 --> 02:47:02.270]  You know you want the truth.
[02:47:02.310 --> 02:47:03.551]  You're not on a globalist payroll.
[02:47:03.911 --> 02:47:10.235]  I respect somebody when the cops did a bad thing, shot that innocent man four or five years ago in San Francisco in the back.
[02:47:11.621 --> 02:47:17.443]  And then lied about it at the train station and took everybody's cameras away but one person crouching in the back of a train got it on tape.
[02:47:18.203 --> 02:47:19.103]  That person's a hero.
[02:47:20.124 --> 02:47:21.404]  They deserve a Pulitzer Prize.
[02:47:22.024 --> 02:47:25.886]  That's journalism out there where they could have been killed for doing that.
[02:47:27.166 --> 02:47:29.307]  Or beat up and sent to prison doing it.
[02:47:30.433 --> 02:47:32.615]  So, that person deserves a prize.
[02:47:32.655 --> 02:47:39.341]  In fact, I want to establish some system where we give yearly awards to the best citizen activists and journalists out there, because this needs to be honored.
[02:47:39.542 --> 02:47:43.185]  The globalists honor all their groups to make us feel small and then big.
[02:47:43.245 --> 02:47:46.688]  Bull, you are more important than the dying dinosaur media.
[02:47:47.557 --> 02:47:49.499]  To take what Matt Drudge said and take it to the next level.
[02:47:49.979 --> 02:47:51.141]  Okay, thank you Kirby.
[02:47:51.461 --> 02:47:53.022]  Appreciate your call.
[02:47:54.464 --> 02:47:56.946]  But see, does Matt Drudge want to hang around with all the famous people?
[02:47:57.166 --> 02:47:57.507]  No, no.
[02:47:58.027 --> 02:48:00.129]  He wants to sit there and encourage real grassroots people.
[02:48:00.410 --> 02:48:03.673]  So do I. Because we're in a war, people.
[02:48:04.694 --> 02:48:06.035]  The globalists are evil.
[02:48:06.375 --> 02:48:08.858]  And once you get that, you understand, this is a fight.
[02:48:12.073 --> 02:48:13.295]  Alright, I want to go to Tia.
[02:48:13.335 --> 02:48:14.716]  I'm listening on KEIB.
[02:48:14.756 --> 02:48:17.880]  I know we've got a lot of new affiliates, but is that a new affiliate?
[02:48:17.900 --> 02:48:19.302]  Because I've never heard of KEIB.
[02:48:19.963 --> 02:48:21.545]  We'll find out exactly where that is in California.
[02:48:21.565 --> 02:48:23.988]  We've got like six or seven affiliates out in California, but that's...
[02:48:25.997 --> 02:48:29.961]  I'll talk to him in just a moment, but first, Suzette, I'd miss what she was saying, that's important.
[02:48:30.442 --> 02:48:32.444]  Chemical plant, local security ramping up.
[02:48:32.484 --> 02:48:36.408]  Yes, they're ramping up security, which bogs down our economy, but we gotta do it.
[02:48:36.909 --> 02:48:42.194]  All over the country, because they believe jihad threats are imminent against chemical plants, nuke plants, you name it.
[02:48:42.975 --> 02:48:45.496]  Because they've gotten the documents from ISIS, that's what they're planning to do.
[02:48:45.896 --> 02:48:47.516]  Why'd you let them in to begin with?
[02:48:47.536 --> 02:48:49.377]  It goes back to what the caller before last said.
[02:48:50.057 --> 02:48:51.798]  So, thank you Suzette, great points.
[02:48:52.518 --> 02:48:54.718]  Let's go ahead, oh no, Suzette's there.
[02:48:54.938 --> 02:48:56.119]  I'm out of control today, excuse me.
[02:48:56.439 --> 02:48:57.279]  Suzette, you're on the air.
[02:48:57.299 --> 02:48:59.580]  Oh, hi Alex.
[02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:00.580]  Thank you, go ahead.
[02:49:00.620 --> 02:49:02.861]  Great to talk to you.
[02:49:03.081 --> 02:49:08.342]  Hey, I just want, this is off-topic, but one of the other guys that lied to Mark Hitler was Mel Brooks.
[02:49:08.702 --> 02:49:10.203]  He made millions doing it.
[02:49:11.323 --> 02:49:11.963]  That's right.
[02:49:12.003 --> 02:49:13.464]  He got to arrest Mel Brooks now.
[02:49:13.544 --> 02:49:14.384]  I guess he's able to.
[02:49:14.404 --> 02:49:16.745]  That's right.
[02:49:16.785 --> 02:49:17.425]  He's racist.
[02:49:19.726 --> 02:49:40.594]  I live all about three or four blocks from a place that used to be called Biofort and now it's Emergent and they were evidently at the time about 9-11 the only place that was producing vaccine for anthrax and a few other things and they are
[02:49:41.061 --> 02:49:46.105]  I knew a vet that worked there and she would talk occasionally about what was going on.
[02:49:46.566 --> 02:49:50.569]  But they have all sorts of little nasties in there.
[02:49:50.589 --> 02:50:01.898]  And I remember not too long ago they were importing scientists from Europe to work there because evidently nobody in the United States was smart enough to work there.
[02:50:03.019 --> 02:50:08.143]  So they have hardened that facility since 9-11.
[02:50:08.463 --> 02:50:10.545]  They've got about 12 foot high
[02:50:11.523 --> 02:50:14.805]  Oh, gothic type fencing with the points at the top.
[02:50:14.865 --> 02:50:19.867]  They've got concertina wire and no man's land between the two fences.
[02:50:20.668 --> 02:50:24.970]  And they built an army depot directly across the street.
[02:50:26.312 --> 02:50:31.794]  Well, they are hardening the infrastructure all over, but you don't do that and leave the border open.
[02:50:31.814 --> 02:50:38.275]  They're like building us up, getting us ready for the attack, and then I guess bringing permanent martial law afterwards, calling it a civil emergency.
[02:50:38.335 --> 02:50:39.436]  Great point, Suzette.
[02:50:39.456 --> 02:50:40.436]  Thanks for holding and telling us that.
[02:50:40.816 --> 02:50:42.957]  By the way, I get all of our affiliates confused.
[02:50:42.977 --> 02:50:46.858]  We have so many, and I know we have two stations in the Los Angeles area.
[02:50:47.038 --> 02:50:48.478]  One barely comes in, one is in it.
[02:50:48.798 --> 02:50:52.720]  That's our big Los Angeles affiliate, K-E-I-B, 1150 AM.
[02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:53.920]  I'm kind of out of it today.
[02:50:54.660 --> 02:50:55.703]  It's called the Patriot.
[02:50:55.723 --> 02:50:56.364]  They're wonderful.
[02:50:56.745 --> 02:51:00.714]  And the one area I dropped the ball is promoting our affiliates, but it's not for lack of love.
[02:51:00.754 --> 02:51:01.917]  It's just I'm overworked, folks.
[02:51:03.180 --> 02:51:05.041]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[02:51:05.121 --> 02:51:06.761]  This is a Hillary Clinton ad from 2008.
[02:51:06.921 --> 02:51:09.382]  It's 3 a.m.
[02:51:09.462 --> 02:51:11.163]  and your children are safe and asleep.
[02:51:11.863 --> 02:51:15.024]  But there's a phone in the White House and it's ringing.
[02:51:15.104 --> 02:51:16.484]  Something's happening in the world.
[02:51:16.504 --> 02:51:18.025]  Hello, Secretary Clinton.
[02:51:18.205 --> 02:51:19.745]  This is Ambassador Stevens.
[02:51:19.785 --> 02:51:22.006]  We are under attack here in Benghazi.
[02:51:22.306 --> 02:51:22.626]  Hello?
[02:51:22.646 --> 02:51:26.108]  Your vote will decide who answers that call.
[02:51:26.328 --> 02:51:27.148]  Bob, what time is it?
[02:51:27.988 --> 02:51:28.849]  Oh, it's 3 a.m.?
[02:51:29.209 --> 02:51:37.052]  Whether it's someone who already knows the world's leaders, knows the military, someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous war... Oh, cool, she should answer.
[02:51:37.072 --> 02:51:37.772]  She said she would.
[02:51:38.092 --> 02:51:39.193]  Hello, we're under attack!
[02:51:39.713 --> 02:51:40.933]  The building's on fire!
[02:51:41.414 --> 02:51:42.414]  They're shooting at us!
[02:51:42.694 --> 02:51:44.115]  There's explosions!
[02:51:44.515 --> 02:51:45.495]  Where the f*** are you?!
[02:51:45.535 --> 02:51:46.876]  You said you were gonna answer!
[02:51:47.476 --> 02:51:49.038]  Come on, Secretary Clinton!
[02:51:49.218 --> 02:51:50.139]  We need you!
[02:51:50.419 --> 02:51:51.560]  Don't leave us!
[02:51:51.641 --> 02:51:52.261]  It's 3 a.m.
[02:51:52.702 --> 02:51:54.483]  and your children are safe and asleep.
[02:51:54.543 --> 02:51:56.686]  Who do you want answering the phone?
[02:51:57.066 --> 02:51:59.328]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:51:59.569 --> 02:52:01.571]  I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
[02:52:04.474 --> 02:52:09.441]  Caitlyn Jenner experienced sex change regret might de-transition, biographer says.
[02:52:09.701 --> 02:52:11.263]  It hasn't been easy for Caitlyn.
[02:52:11.423 --> 02:52:12.405]  It's been very hard.
[02:52:12.925 --> 02:52:18.172]  Ian Halperin recalls one source telling him, well, you are a dude dressed like a lady.
[02:52:18.433 --> 02:52:19.394]  Dude looks like a lady!
[02:52:19.414 --> 02:52:25.855]  Caitlyn Jenner, who announced her transition from man to woman last year, has considered de-transitioning.
[02:52:26.035 --> 02:52:30.156]  The author of a new book about the Kardashian family told The Wrap on Wednesday.
[02:52:30.176 --> 02:52:42.159]  Ian Halperin, the author of Kardashian Dynasty, the controversial rise of America's royal family, thanks to all you crazy leftists who want to ban freedom, have made these kind of people celebrities.
[02:52:42.299 --> 02:52:42.919]  Thank you.
[02:52:43.179 --> 02:52:46.760]  One source confirmed to me Caitlyn has made whispers of sex change regret.
[02:52:47.020 --> 02:52:48.441]  You didn't even change sex!
[02:52:48.481 --> 02:52:50.662]  You're a guy with a dress on!
[02:52:50.802 --> 02:52:52.302]  Get with the program, dude!
[02:52:52.343 --> 02:52:53.403]  You're delusional!
[02:52:53.583 --> 02:52:54.684]  Put on some shorts!
[02:52:54.844 --> 02:52:57.625]  Get a tank top, eat some Wheaties, and go for a jog!
[02:52:57.745 --> 02:52:59.466]  This is Joe Bakes with InfoWars.com
[02:53:02.898 --> 02:53:04.299]  My name is Alex Jones.
[02:53:04.820 --> 02:53:10.745]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:53:10.965 --> 02:53:25.137]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[02:53:25.717 --> 02:53:27.659]  They're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[02:53:28.039 --> 02:53:35.865]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[02:53:36.085 --> 02:53:43.190]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[02:53:43.491 --> 02:53:49.235]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[02:53:49.355 --> 02:53:55.540]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[02:53:55.780 --> 02:54:00.803]  Check them out today at Infowarslife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[02:54:00.823 --> 02:54:12.588]  All right, I tend to spin out of control sometimes with a third, fourth hour.
[02:54:12.648 --> 02:54:18.031]  We have a former Army Ranger assigned as a contractor to the CIA, Benghazi Hero joining us.
[02:54:18.051 --> 02:54:20.472]  He wrote the book, 13 Hours, that was made into the film.
[02:54:21.333 --> 02:54:21.953]  In the next hour,
[02:54:25.047 --> 02:54:26.989]  I am a syndicated radio host.
[02:54:27.029 --> 02:54:30.033]  I've been in the top, you know, 20 talkers or whatever in magazines and stuff.
[02:54:30.093 --> 02:54:32.035]  I really don't have time to follow all that.
[02:54:33.136 --> 02:54:34.117]  We dominate the internet.
[02:54:34.137 --> 02:54:35.058]  We dominate YouTube.
[02:54:35.378 --> 02:54:36.399]  We dominate Facebook.
[02:54:38.582 --> 02:54:40.524]  Some say I'm in the top 10 terrestrial host.
[02:54:41.244 --> 02:54:42.626]  I'm not measuring things here.
[02:54:42.706 --> 02:54:43.647]  I just want to warn people.
[02:54:44.167 --> 02:54:46.069]  I hope all the big hosts start talking about this stuff.
[02:54:49.907 --> 02:55:03.797]  I really need to spend more time with our AM and FM affiliates, and more time cutting liners for them, and more time even working with listeners to buy billboards and advertising, because the show really has hit its biggest growth period ever.
[02:55:03.817 --> 02:55:07.880]  When I talk about how many affiliates we have, it's way higher than I've even been saying.
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:16.807]  I just am too busy battling the globalists to even pay attention, and I don't have the crew or infrastructure to focus on a lot of the things we're doing, because I don't have the capital.
[02:55:17.836 --> 02:55:19.137]  And talk radios that way too.
[02:55:19.517 --> 02:55:26.259]  Giant audiences, the best place to advertise compared to the internet and TV and stuff in my view, but people just don't know that.
[02:55:26.740 --> 02:55:29.001]  And I think radio is so neglected.
[02:55:30.261 --> 02:55:34.723]  But I was thinking when they said the affiliate's name and I'm going to call her, let's put it back on screen for TV viewers.
[02:55:36.169 --> 02:55:44.255]  When they said the radio call letters for KEIB 1150, I used to go on that station as a guest overnights.
[02:55:44.795 --> 02:55:49.539]  It's 50,000 watts daytime, 44,000 watts nighttime.
[02:55:49.939 --> 02:55:52.561]  Folks, AM goes across the country with that level of power.
[02:55:54.363 --> 02:55:57.144]  Now mainly it aims out at the ocean, but that's one of the top stations in LA.
[02:55:57.824 --> 02:56:01.926]  And it's like surreal that I'm on some of the biggest stations in New York, Chicago, you name it.
[02:56:02.326 --> 02:56:07.108]  They'll have like New York Times articles going, Alex Jones is an internet radio host.
[02:56:07.208 --> 02:56:09.669]  Like I haven't been on AM and FM radio for 21 years.
[02:56:10.250 --> 02:56:14.651]  But that's how they manipulate their audiences, that's why they're losing their audiences.
[02:56:14.691 --> 02:56:19.573]  But yes, we're like on WNJ, 1160, 20,000 watts, in the daytime, in New York City.
[02:56:24.389 --> 02:56:35.472]  I've got to do targeted ads for my listeners in that area or something just to help those stations because it's so good to be on some of the biggest stations in the country.
[02:56:36.193 --> 02:56:37.213]  And it's happening.
[02:56:37.753 --> 02:56:40.854]  And it's because people finally go, wait, I guess Alex Jones is really right.
[02:56:42.295 --> 02:56:45.876]  Stuff has gone so far now that I'm almost basically becoming passé.
[02:56:46.856 --> 02:56:47.816]  But isn't that good?
[02:56:47.896 --> 02:56:49.297]  And we get stations great ratings.
[02:56:50.502 --> 02:56:54.406]  But it is so important to spread the word about those stations, to become sponsors of those.
[02:56:54.446 --> 02:56:59.190]  I cannot stress to you enough how serious this globalist war is against free and independent media.
[02:56:59.210 --> 02:57:00.471]  Look at the Facebook Senate hearings.
[02:57:00.871 --> 02:57:01.491]  We exposed it.
[02:57:01.531 --> 02:57:02.112]  You exposed it.
[02:57:02.152 --> 02:57:03.073]  Talk Radio exposed it.
[02:57:03.433 --> 02:57:04.354]  Drudge Report exposed it.
[02:57:04.394 --> 02:57:05.195]  There's now hearings.
[02:57:05.615 --> 02:57:09.538]  And it was like they untied a boat from the dock with the engine on.
[02:57:09.778 --> 02:57:11.480]  We're now flying at high speed.
[02:57:12.621 --> 02:57:17.425]  All of our Facebook stuff is suddenly just exploding because they took the foot off our neck.
[02:57:19.411 --> 02:57:21.996]  And if they're gonna have a foot on our neck, they should at least be honest about it.
[02:57:22.456 --> 02:57:30.290]  Tim in California is calling and he says he wants Hugh Hewitt for VP, I guess for Trump.
[02:57:30.331 --> 02:57:30.791]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:57:31.834 --> 02:57:35.577]  I love you Alex, I'm Tim Callum carrying Hugh Hewitt for U.S.
[02:57:35.657 --> 02:57:39.280]  Vice President for Trump and Tim Callum carrying for U.S.
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:40.180]  President, U.S.
[02:57:40.220 --> 02:57:40.941]  Senate, and U.S.
[02:57:40.981 --> 02:57:42.702]  House Best Major Candidate.
[02:57:43.083 --> 02:57:46.705]  T-I-M space K-A-L-E-M-K-A-R-I-E-N.
[02:57:46.745 --> 02:57:49.588]  Hugh Hewitt's a great talk show host.
[02:57:49.648 --> 02:57:50.769]  I think I've been on his show before.
[02:57:50.789 --> 02:57:53.471]  I'm trying to get rid of Obamacare.
[02:57:53.491 --> 02:57:55.492]  I want Hugh Hewitt to be my Vice President.
[02:57:56.093 --> 02:57:56.353]  Also.
[02:57:56.738 --> 02:57:58.279]  Well, I want to make you Vice President, Tim.
[02:57:58.379 --> 02:58:00.881]  All I know is, isn't it exciting how fast people are waking up?
[02:58:00.941 --> 02:58:03.063]  I mean, I'm not trying to put perfume on a pig here.
[02:58:03.083 --> 02:58:05.264]  We're in a pickle, but a kettle of fish.
[02:58:05.304 --> 02:58:06.765]  But I tell you, some good stuff's happening, too.
[02:58:06.785 --> 02:58:07.166]  What do you think?
[02:58:08.616 --> 02:58:09.597]  Uh, I think it's great.
[02:58:09.637 --> 02:58:12.039]  You're on from midnight till 3 a.m.
[02:58:12.139 --> 02:58:15.683]  here on 1-1-5-0-A-M-K-E-I-B.
[02:58:15.963 --> 02:58:24.030]  I know, and I've been on there like a year and a half, and I remember them telling me a year and a half ago, oh, you're on a 50,000-watt blowtorch in L.A., one of the top stations, and it's just, like, surreal.
[02:58:24.430 --> 02:58:27.293]  Because, folks, it's so hard to get on those, it'll make your head spin.
[02:58:28.053 --> 02:58:30.055]  Uh, but, uh, that's how it operates.
[02:58:30.976 --> 02:58:36.318]  Look, when I got big on XM and Sirius, they had big money come in from Goldman Sachs to get me off.
[02:58:36.338 --> 02:58:37.839]  I mean, I was told that by the execs.
[02:58:38.199 --> 02:58:39.340]  This is a war, folks.
[02:58:39.700 --> 02:58:41.821]  We'll be back in 60 seconds with a fourth hour.
[02:58:42.901 --> 02:58:43.562]  I love you all.
[02:58:43.722 --> 02:58:44.842]  It's great to be a patriot, isn't it?
[02:58:45.502 --> 02:58:48.944]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:52.731 --> 02:59:01.759]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:59:01.839 --> 02:59:10.067]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:10.247 --> 02:59:14.911]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:15.111 --> 02:59:21.834]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:21.894 --> 02:59:28.978]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:29.078 --> 02:59:35.941]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:36.101 --> 02:59:40.463]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:40.583 --> 02:59:43.805]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:43.965 --> 02:59:45.667]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:09.682 --> 03:00:13.187]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:00:13.747 --> 03:00:15.509]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.055 --> 03:00:40.392]  The CIA station chief, where you were at the time, told you repeatedly, according to the movie, stand down.
[03:00:40.432 --> 03:00:41.393]  We saw that in the trailer.
[03:00:41.533 --> 03:00:43.315]  Use the words, stand down.
[03:00:43.335 --> 03:00:44.557]  Is that how you remember it?
[03:00:45.157 --> 03:00:52.525]  Yeah, I mean, uh, it was him, it was the chief of base, deputy chief, and our team leader that were sitting on the front porch when he told me to stand down.
[03:00:53.506 --> 03:00:55.948]  It was, Tig said, right, we're losing initiative.
[03:00:56.449 --> 03:00:56.949]  And we were.
[03:00:57.270 --> 03:00:57.970]  Why is it wrong?
[03:00:58.091 --> 03:01:02.155]  Why, you know, the position is, you're here to protect the annex.
[03:01:02.355 --> 03:01:14.746]  They have some security personnel over at the consulate, which our viewers should know, congressional investigators have already found was woefully inadequate and that we were totally unprepared, that state had totally left those guys unprepared to defend themselves.
[03:01:14.806 --> 03:01:20.952]  But, in the moment, that station chief at the Annex is saying to you, stand down, you're here to protect us, this facility, not that one.
[03:01:21.312 --> 03:01:24.915]  Well, I really don't think it was just for us to protect that facility.
[03:01:24.935 --> 03:01:26.116]  That's just how he was.
[03:01:27.277 --> 03:01:30.780]  There's multiple security situations when we should have left, and he never let us go.
[03:01:30.800 --> 03:01:30.860]  Why?
[03:01:30.940 --> 03:01:33.562]  He was just risk adverse, in my opinion.
[03:01:34.503 --> 03:01:37.446]  This last station, he wanted his legacy to be what it was.
[03:01:37.466 --> 03:01:38.707]  He didn't want to lose anybody, I guess.
[03:01:39.167 --> 03:01:44.250]  You got trained Army Rangers, you got Navy SEALs, you got Marines.
[03:01:44.290 --> 03:01:46.731]  The best, the best in the world standing there ready to go.
[03:01:48.752 --> 03:01:56.456]  We have had the former Speaker of the House Boehner, who I'm not a fan of, another rhino, but he's even come out and said Hillary really shouldn't run.
[03:01:56.516 --> 03:01:57.256]  She should drop out.
[03:01:57.296 --> 03:01:59.718]  There's a good chance she's going to get indicted.
[03:02:00.318 --> 03:02:02.159]  Well, I mean, she's been caught on the servers.
[03:02:02.299 --> 03:02:03.980]  She's been caught in Benghazi.
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:05.621]  She's been caught over and over again.
[03:02:07.321 --> 03:02:08.704]  I'm really worried about her supporters.
[03:02:08.724 --> 03:02:11.791]  I mean, if there was a Republican with all this baggage, I wouldn't support him.
[03:02:13.856 --> 03:02:16.402]  And then when she's President, what crimes is she going to commit?
[03:02:17.472 --> 03:02:21.516]  Chris Parenteau was one of the folks that was there brave enough to go on Fox a few months ago.
[03:02:21.536 --> 03:02:27.763]  An Army Ranger, saw a lot of combat duty, and then got into the CIA as a contractor in their annexed security team.
[03:02:28.043 --> 03:02:31.667]  He's one of the few survivors from it, and one of the people that refused to stand down.
[03:02:31.687 --> 03:02:32.588]  And he was there.
[03:02:32.868 --> 03:02:36.872]  They testified to the orders to stand down from their boss.
[03:02:37.393 --> 03:02:38.835]  And of course, we know who was getting orders.
[03:02:40.478 --> 03:02:42.659]  At that point, it was coming directly from the State Department.
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:45.701]  This could really bring down the entire corrupt system within.
[03:02:45.721 --> 03:03:01.211]  We're going to go to break in a moment, come back with a long segment with our guests, but Chris, is this surreal for you to be in the middle of this and now it'd be a major movie based on your book and other research and others and to see Hillary still hanging on by her fingernails?
[03:03:02.552 --> 03:03:05.894]  Honestly, as the more stuff that comes out, you know, we just had a
[03:03:06.901 --> 03:03:15.747]  Another revelation with the Special Forces Sergeant Major that came out, Adam Housley reported on it, as well as one of the pilots from Avion Air Base.
[03:03:15.988 --> 03:03:17.869]  It's becoming, it's vindicating.
[03:03:18.389 --> 03:03:24.654]  It's becoming more and more, it's more and more vindicating to us because it's showing that we are telling the truth.
[03:03:24.774 --> 03:03:33.540]  That myself, Tig, and Oz, and the other two guys, Jack and Boone, that we came out initially, said what took place, people didn't believe us.
[03:03:34.386 --> 03:03:37.048]  Uh, book was written to get this started, to get the truth out there.
[03:03:37.088 --> 03:03:42.412]  And now as more information comes out, people are finally saying, Hey, guess what?
[03:03:42.472 --> 03:03:48.636]  Rangers, SEALs and Marines, they aren't lying, which I don't know why people would say that anyway, but they did initially the first two, three years.
[03:03:49.236 --> 03:03:51.097]  So to me, it's, it's, it's vindicating.
[03:03:51.138 --> 03:03:57.602]  And to see her keep saying that, uh, it didn't happen to call the families liars to basically call us liars.
[03:03:58.789 --> 03:03:59.749]  Surreal isn't the word.
[03:04:00.070 --> 03:04:01.631]  It's more anger and disrespect.
[03:04:01.811 --> 03:04:03.332]  That's what I continue to feel.
[03:04:03.352 --> 03:04:05.674]  And the more that comes out, the more anger I feel.
[03:04:10.031 --> 03:04:18.076]  Well, I tell you, it is simply, simply incredible to be in the middle of this as just a reporter since day one, having people on like Colonel Schaefer and others.
[03:04:18.236 --> 03:04:24.140]  A week after it happened, he'd obviously already heard to the military, to the army, exactly what had unfolded and what had gone on.
[03:04:24.720 --> 03:04:29.383]  And it's just, it's so sad that we've gotten to this point as a nation.
[03:04:29.883 --> 03:04:32.685]  We're going to break in a moment, but in your gut, where do you think this is all going?
[03:04:33.806 --> 03:04:39.169]  Well, the more that good people, the ones that were on the ground that were trying to assist,
[03:04:39.667 --> 03:04:39.867]  Absolutely.
[03:04:39.907 --> 03:04:40.307]  This is huge.
[03:04:40.327 --> 03:04:41.127]  Chris, stay right there.
[03:04:41.627 --> 03:04:42.148]  We'll be back.
[03:04:42.188 --> 03:04:42.488]  Thank you.
[03:05:02.350 --> 03:05:03.351]  Brain Force is here.
[03:05:03.891 --> 03:05:06.173]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:05:06.433 --> 03:05:14.258]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:05:15.034 --> 03:05:18.156]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[03:05:18.476 --> 03:05:18.617]  Right?
[03:05:18.637 --> 03:05:20.978]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:05:21.338 --> 03:05:24.861]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:05:24.901 --> 03:05:28.043]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:05:28.544 --> 03:05:33.287]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:05:33.887 --> 03:05:35.709]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[03:05:36.049 --> 03:05:40.492]  That is activated by the different compounds in the yerba mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:05:40.652 --> 03:05:42.653]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:05:43.274 --> 03:05:44.735]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:05:44.895 --> 03:05:45.135]  Exactly.
[03:05:45.155 --> 03:05:48.959]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:05:49.460 --> 03:05:57.448]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[03:08:15.879 --> 03:08:16.620]  Big Brother.
[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:18.241]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:18.822 --> 03:08:19.883]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:20.744 --> 03:08:22.165]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:08:22.425 --> 03:08:23.566]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:24.067 --> 03:08:28.591]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:32.020 --> 03:08:35.921]  Chris Tonto Paranto, as he's known, former Ranger, 2nd Battalion, 75th Element.
[03:08:35.941 --> 03:08:40.542]  I don't want to go over his whole bio, he's only here with us a couple more segments, he's got to go.
[03:08:41.542 --> 03:08:58.186]  Security military consultant, hero of Benghazi attack, and he wrote the book, 13 Hours, it's based on that, and I couldn't believe Hollywood put something out that according to people that I know, that you know all these guys, and now we're talking to one of them themselves that wrote the book on it, it's very accurate from their perspective.
[03:08:58.846 --> 03:09:06.870]  I only had the perspective of Colonel Schaefer and Tosh Plumley and other Pentagon sources that within a week said, ordered, came down from the CIA.
[03:09:07.110 --> 03:09:08.051]  That was from the State Department.
[03:09:08.071 --> 03:09:09.111]  They had drones over it.
[03:09:09.532 --> 03:09:10.832]  Eight hours of firefights.
[03:09:11.232 --> 03:09:12.693]  Hours before that to stand down.
[03:09:12.773 --> 03:09:16.035]  I mean, Hillary and Obama really think we're stupid.
[03:09:16.515 --> 03:09:21.858]  Let me ask Chris, who is a hero, because he has the will not just to have courage physically, but to buck
[03:09:22.498 --> 03:09:23.938]  Them saying, shut up and lie.
[03:09:24.459 --> 03:09:26.599]  And a lot of other folks have had that courage, that moral courage.
[03:09:27.379 --> 03:09:29.300]  What do you think they were really doing there?
[03:09:29.440 --> 03:09:31.361]  Why are they covering it up so nakedly?
[03:09:31.721 --> 03:09:38.383]  Why do they think they could have a 13 hour stand down and not have the whole internal military structure learn of the treason?
[03:09:39.383 --> 03:09:42.824]  You know, it goes to arrogance, the way I look at it.
[03:09:43.524 --> 03:09:45.085]  And you said it, you said it right there.
[03:09:45.485 --> 03:09:47.305]  Are they going to just lie and people going to believe it?
[03:09:47.385 --> 03:09:48.126]  Well, you know what?
[03:09:48.206 --> 03:09:49.186]  Half America did.
[03:09:50.266 --> 03:09:52.067]  Um, and that just goes to arrogance.
[03:09:52.087 --> 03:10:00.173]  That goes to how our country is nowadays as well, where they would rather believe politicians than seals and rangers and Marines and military veterans.
[03:10:00.413 --> 03:10:01.954]  That's a sorry state we're in right now.
[03:10:02.874 --> 03:10:04.836]  Another reason, you know, there was an election going on.
[03:10:04.896 --> 03:10:06.697]  Terrorism was on the run, which it wasn't.
[03:10:07.737 --> 03:10:19.205]  So, you know, it comes out that there's a terrorist attack and an ambassador of Chris Stevens' stature, a great man, dies, you know, and Mitt Romney actually grabs his own, grabs himself there.
[03:10:19.890 --> 03:10:22.732]  And as a man about it, he attacks Obama, he wins the election.
[03:10:23.413 --> 03:10:25.454]  So there's a lot of different things.
[03:10:25.474 --> 03:10:29.177]  And then also just overthrow Qaddafi was a mistake, to be honest with you.
[03:10:30.077 --> 03:10:34.220]  And that was the State Department that pushed that, that was Hillary that pushed that, so that puts her in a bad light.
[03:10:34.240 --> 03:10:38.623]  There's so many different reasons that they wanted to spin the truth.
[03:10:38.923 --> 03:10:42.746]  Well, your book is, what is it, a number one New York Times bestseller now?
[03:10:43.326 --> 03:10:46.469]  It has been several times, the hardback and the paperback both.
[03:10:46.769 --> 03:10:48.310]  It's been on New York Times for
[03:10:48.750 --> 03:10:49.990]  Geez, I don't know, three years now.
[03:10:50.270 --> 03:10:51.731]  So off and on for the last three years.
[03:10:51.911 --> 03:10:53.771]  So people want to know the truth.
[03:10:53.851 --> 03:10:58.513]  And the more they find out from folks like yourself, the more they find out from people coming forward.
[03:10:58.813 --> 03:11:01.013]  Trey Gowdy's committee actually I think is doing a good job.
[03:11:01.473 --> 03:11:04.114]  The more people go and pick up the book and they read what happened on the ground.
[03:11:04.514 --> 03:11:11.336]  And I'm glad people are doing that because they finally are listening to the guys that were on the ground that night and not politicians that were watching it on Facebook or social media.
[03:11:12.495 --> 03:11:15.117]  I just don't know how Hillary and Obama thought they'd get away with it.
[03:11:15.157 --> 03:11:23.182]  Joe Biggs, I mean, you've been in the military, you've been in combat, you've got more experience interviewing this guy than I do, but it just seems crazy that they think they'd get away with this.
[03:11:23.282 --> 03:11:32.969]  Well, the thing is, is we have these reports coming out that the Air Force had these F-16s on standby, fueling, they could have been there, you know, as an air asset to cover these guys.
[03:11:33.349 --> 03:11:38.092]  And in the past, right, Chris, you guys had used some of these assets before in previous missions.
[03:11:38.512 --> 03:11:41.875]  So it's really weird for me that all of a sudden, this time, this day,
[03:11:42.856 --> 03:11:44.198]  They weren't able to do it.
[03:11:44.298 --> 03:11:49.565]  You know, I talked to Maureen yesterday that has buddies that's part of a fast team that was ready to go in there and help out as well.
[03:11:49.845 --> 03:11:52.509]  And for some reason, everyone was told to stand down.
[03:11:52.529 --> 03:11:53.510]  Well, let's talk about that.
[03:11:53.970 --> 03:11:54.071]  Yeah.
[03:11:55.409 --> 03:11:55.769]  And that's...
[03:12:26.902 --> 03:12:30.044]  Because of my non-disclosure, and maybe that answers your question right there.
[03:12:30.064 --> 03:12:32.965]  Because of my non-disclosure, I can't discuss a lot of that stuff.
[03:12:33.345 --> 03:12:33.565]  Wow.
[03:12:33.625 --> 03:12:34.366]  What about threats?
[03:12:34.386 --> 03:12:39.548]  We know a lot of higher-ups have been threatened, people have been sanctioned, just a lot of crazy things have happened.
[03:12:39.568 --> 03:12:41.708]  They've talked about witness protection programs and things.
[03:12:41.729 --> 03:12:41.929]  Yeah.
[03:12:42.089 --> 03:12:43.189]  I mean, can you speak to the threats?
[03:12:43.909 --> 03:12:47.671]  You know, a lot of it really was passive-aggressive threats.
[03:12:48.211 --> 03:12:51.492]  It does take a lot of moral courage to actually step forward.
[03:12:51.532 --> 03:12:52.593]  We lost our jobs because
[03:12:53.593 --> 03:12:57.157]  Um, you know, you put your faith in God a little bit and say, you know, what's the right thing to do here?
[03:12:57.358 --> 03:12:58.659]  Well, the right thing to do is tell the truth.
[03:12:58.739 --> 03:12:59.560]  We lost our jobs.
[03:13:00.101 --> 03:13:03.104]  A lot of those people that were saved that night aren't doing the right thing.
[03:13:03.204 --> 03:13:04.285]  They don't have the moral courage.
[03:13:04.365 --> 03:13:05.667]  They're worried about their jobs.
[03:13:05.687 --> 03:13:08.150]  They're worried about finances, which, hey, I understand that.
[03:13:08.570 --> 03:13:14.355]  But there comes a time where you just gotta step forward and say, you know what, I may lose my job here, I may be reprimanded, but the right thing is to tell the truth.
[03:13:14.415 --> 03:13:16.997]  And a lot of those people that were saved that night, they get to see their families.
[03:13:17.658 --> 03:13:19.479]  And I expected more from them as well.
[03:13:19.680 --> 03:13:27.306]  A lot of those guys out there, they're still working, that know what's going on, and that aren't standing up and telling the actual truth of what took place there that night.
[03:13:27.426 --> 03:13:38.050]  So you had to do the right thing when you were ordered to stand down repeatedly and go and fight the Al Qaeda trash, and then do the moral right thing again and go out and speak out and say, no, we're being lied to.
[03:13:38.070 --> 03:13:38.950]  We were ordered to stand down.
[03:13:39.770 --> 03:13:40.150]  Yes, sir.
[03:13:40.851 --> 03:13:41.731]  And luckily...
[03:13:42.535 --> 03:13:46.857]  I was with a fantastic team that night, and it carried over into today.
[03:13:47.498 --> 03:13:48.698]  We stuck together as a team.
[03:13:48.758 --> 03:13:51.980]  When this first went down, we continued to deploy, except for Oz.
[03:13:52.100 --> 03:13:55.942]  Oz had his arm severely injured, so he couldn't deploy, but the rest of us continued to go overseas.
[03:13:56.783 --> 03:14:04.287]  After we were treated poorly for about eight months, we decided as a team, we voted on it, and if everybody voted yes, we were going to tell the truth.
[03:14:04.307 --> 03:14:05.968]  If any one of us voted no,
[03:14:06.488 --> 03:14:10.029]  We would not say anything and all of us unanimously said yes, we're going to tell the truth.
[03:14:10.109 --> 03:14:15.751]  So being able to stick together as a team has been able to embolden us to get out there and tell the truth.
[03:14:15.891 --> 03:14:24.133]  I honestly just think it's amazing that you guys ended up having the courage to go out there and ignore the commands to stand down and go out there and finally fight and help those guys out.
[03:14:24.193 --> 03:14:26.614]  Because you guys were roughly, you got a call it was like 9.47pm to stand down.
[03:14:29.335 --> 03:14:30.996]  And there's differences on that, too.
[03:14:31.036 --> 03:14:32.417]  I swore, and I've still got my watch.
[03:14:32.518 --> 03:14:33.398]  The call that we got was 932.
[03:14:34.499 --> 03:14:36.881]  I remember looking at my watch because I didn't want to get bothered.
[03:14:37.521 --> 03:14:38.662]  Joe, you know the deal at night.
[03:14:38.742 --> 03:14:41.844]  You know, you don't want to get bothered when it's almost night and you get called in the evening time.
[03:14:41.864 --> 03:14:42.485]  I looked at my watch, 932.
[03:14:42.545 --> 03:14:43.606]  We're ready to go by 937.
[03:14:45.507 --> 03:14:48.870]  And we were told to wait, stand down, then wait again.
[03:14:49.690 --> 03:14:51.552]  I don't think it takes moral courage.
[03:14:51.572 --> 03:14:52.833]  I don't think it takes courage to do that.
[03:14:52.873 --> 03:14:54.794]  It takes the ability to sacrifice yourself.
[03:14:55.215 --> 03:14:58.017]  It takes the ability to give yourself for another human being.
[03:14:58.077 --> 03:14:58.717]  That's what it is.
[03:14:58.737 --> 03:15:03.901]  You guys were about a mile and a half away from the... Not even that far.
[03:15:03.982 --> 03:15:04.602]  Not even that far.
[03:15:04.982 --> 03:15:09.666]  So when you guys went in, when you guys decided to just go anyways, you guys drove some of the way, right?
[03:15:09.706 --> 03:15:10.647]  And then you went on foot?
[03:15:11.167 --> 03:15:11.367]  Yeah.
[03:15:11.687 --> 03:15:14.890]  And then you guys were encountering, you know, uh, resistance through there.
[03:15:14.910 --> 03:15:15.630]  So tell me about that.
[03:15:15.650 --> 03:15:16.911]  That was, that's amazing.
[03:15:16.951 --> 03:15:17.191]  Yeah.
[03:15:17.211 --> 03:15:18.252]  I mean, this is a snapshot.
[03:15:18.272 --> 03:15:19.092]  People should read the book.
[03:15:19.132 --> 03:15:19.933]  They should see the film.
[03:15:19.993 --> 03:15:20.593]  I'll be honest.
[03:15:20.633 --> 03:15:24.256]  At first I was like, they claim this is nonpolitical, so it better tell the truth.
[03:15:24.536 --> 03:15:25.317]  I hadn't read the book.
[03:15:25.357 --> 03:15:26.417]  I didn't know it was based on this book.
[03:15:26.437 --> 03:15:27.838]  I just kind of, you know, was reading the news.
[03:15:27.858 --> 03:15:29.139]  It was all about the director and stuff.
[03:15:29.599 --> 03:15:31.601]  And then it came out and I finally went and saw it.
[03:15:31.981 --> 03:15:35.303]  And I was like, wow, this is accurate from, from, from what the witnesses said.
[03:15:35.483 --> 03:15:37.024]  Oh, it's based on one of the hero's books.
[03:15:37.064 --> 03:15:37.545]  Now I get it.
[03:15:37.825 --> 03:15:39.126]  Cause I just don't trust Hollywood.
[03:15:39.406 --> 03:15:41.648]  And I don't get it, because they bent over backwards for Hillary.
[03:15:41.889 --> 03:15:43.590]  80% of the money in Hollywood has gone to Hillary.
[03:15:44.011 --> 03:15:48.996]  I'm really proud of this director, and I'm proud of the folks associated with it in Hollywood.
[03:15:49.016 --> 03:15:59.246]  I want to talk about that night briefly, but let's talk about some of the other heroes here, Chris, because they don't want credit, but to have a free press and a free media, we need to give credit to protect these people, because these are the real Americans.
[03:15:59.447 --> 03:16:01.549]  Who are some of the other folks that helped get this film out?
[03:16:02.049 --> 03:16:04.210]  Oh, you know, Michael Bay is outstanding.
[03:16:04.890 --> 03:16:10.331]  You know, he's the Transformers series, you know, Michael Bay, Armageddon, explosions, so forth.
[03:16:10.511 --> 03:16:11.811]  Autobots transform and roll.
[03:16:11.851 --> 03:16:17.492]  Yeah, honestly, he was perfect for this because people don't realize he is a huge veteran supporter.
[03:16:17.893 --> 03:16:18.233]  Huge.
[03:16:18.273 --> 03:16:21.393]  He uses veterans on all his extras on his movie sets.
[03:16:22.654 --> 03:16:25.694]  Michael Bay is a hero because he stuck his neck out there to do this.
[03:16:25.834 --> 03:16:27.095]  I guarantee he got threatened.
[03:16:27.175 --> 03:16:27.855]  I just know he did.
[03:16:27.895 --> 03:16:28.935]  I haven't heard that enough.
[03:16:29.475 --> 03:16:31.276]  I bet she did too, but you know what, it's Michael Bay.
[03:16:31.816 --> 03:16:38.040]  They actually grabbed some VARA troops from El Paso for Bliss to help out with the Transformer movie.
[03:16:38.100 --> 03:16:42.222]  Well, we've only got about 6-7 minutes left with our guests, and jump in Joe, because you're more of an expert than I am with Chris here.
[03:16:42.762 --> 03:16:48.386]  Chris Tanto, what is the best website for people to visit?
[03:16:48.446 --> 03:16:50.507]  Is it Chris Tanto, Paranto?
[03:16:51.215 --> 03:16:52.356]  Yeah, that's it.
[03:16:52.416 --> 03:16:54.197]  Chris, Tonto, Paranto, Tanto, Paranto.
[03:16:54.457 --> 03:16:55.738]  You know, Alex, you're white.
[03:16:55.858 --> 03:16:56.098]  I know.
[03:16:56.198 --> 03:16:56.839]  It's Tonto.
[03:16:58.620 --> 03:17:00.181]  It was T-O-N-T-O, brother.
[03:17:00.802 --> 03:17:04.724]  The reason I made it Tonto, T-A-N-T-O, because I'm Mexican-Spanish.
[03:17:04.784 --> 03:17:07.326]  If it's T-O-N-T-O, Tonto, that means fool.
[03:17:07.606 --> 03:17:10.428]  So, say it, Tanto, no big deal.
[03:17:10.488 --> 03:17:12.890]  Chris, Tanto, Paranto, T-A-N-T-O.
[03:17:12.910 --> 03:17:14.911]  So, what is the right way to say it, then?
[03:17:14.971 --> 03:17:15.532]  It's Tonto.
[03:17:15.752 --> 03:17:16.392]  Tonto.
[03:17:17.013 --> 03:17:18.033]  But you can say it however you want.
[03:17:18.173 --> 03:17:19.995]  I want to know where the Lone Ranger is in all this.
[03:17:20.635 --> 03:17:22.457]  You guys were kind of the lone rangers that night, huh?
[03:17:22.937 --> 03:17:23.578]  Yeah, I was.
[03:17:23.638 --> 03:17:26.041]  I was actually the lone, the only ranger on the team.
[03:17:26.081 --> 03:17:28.723]  There were two SEALs, three Marines, and I was the lone ranger.
[03:17:29.264 --> 03:17:31.967]  And, of course, I held the Marines and the SEALs together that night.
[03:17:32.007 --> 03:17:32.667]  No, I'm kidding.
[03:17:32.747 --> 03:17:34.509]  I'm kidding all you SEALs and Marines out there.
[03:17:34.549 --> 03:17:35.030]  Rangers lead the way.
[03:17:35.130 --> 03:17:35.931]  All the way, brother.
[03:17:36.671 --> 03:17:40.414]  But it was a fantastic team, and Joe was right.
[03:17:40.434 --> 03:17:41.514]  The media doesn't tell you this.
[03:17:41.674 --> 03:17:44.216]  We stopped 400 meters short and had to fight our way on.
[03:17:44.296 --> 03:17:45.417]  It took us another 30 minutes.
[03:17:45.437 --> 03:17:47.658]  And how many hundreds of guys did you fight and kill?
[03:17:47.678 --> 03:17:51.520]  I mean, this is like an Alamo scenario, but you ended up almost basically winning.
[03:17:51.901 --> 03:17:59.305]  Yeah, we did until they brought the mortars in, which we couldn't defend, which it would have been nice to have the Air Force there to help us with that, which I know they were trying.
[03:18:00.286 --> 03:18:05.429]  We had 80 reports from 30 to 70, but we never got an official count because
[03:18:06.147 --> 03:18:07.528]  At that time Benghazi didn't happen.
[03:18:25.925 --> 03:18:28.506]  I'm seeing 50, and you're seeing wave after wave.
[03:18:28.526 --> 03:18:30.307]  You're just, you're just, you're just shooting guys.
[03:18:30.387 --> 03:18:30.967]  That's what you're doing.
[03:18:31.027 --> 03:18:32.128]  You're just shooting them as they come.
[03:18:32.508 --> 03:18:33.608]  And you're not even keeping count.
[03:18:33.728 --> 03:18:35.089]  That guy goes down, go the next guy.
[03:18:35.109 --> 03:18:36.489]  That guy goes down, go the next guy.
[03:18:36.509 --> 03:18:37.290]  It's like whack-a-mole.
[03:18:37.430 --> 03:18:38.910]  You're just whacking them and they're going down.
[03:18:39.430 --> 03:18:43.072]  So, but a body count, I'll be honest, we never got an official body count.
[03:18:43.112 --> 03:18:48.674]  We got an unofficial count of around 50, is what the unofficial was from a local there that was in Libya that told us.
[03:18:48.954 --> 03:18:50.695]  He said the hospital was just full of bodies.
[03:18:51.755 --> 03:18:52.496]  And that's all we got.
[03:18:52.676 --> 03:18:53.076]  We didn't know.
[03:18:54.460 --> 03:18:55.020]  Incredible.
[03:18:55.461 --> 03:19:00.124]  And now those very same type of people that survived admit they've gone on to Syria to run around and slaughter everybody.
[03:19:00.464 --> 03:19:09.429]  What do you make of now seeing Obama and others trying to back ISIS, Al Qaeda groups, our own Pentagon leadership actually came out and said we're not going to do this anymore.
[03:19:09.449 --> 03:19:13.392]  I was really proud of Chairman Dempsey and others at the time saying no.
[03:19:14.072 --> 03:19:21.237]  And now reportedly even Cy Herson, the New York Magazine's written about it, I'm sure you've heard about it, that our own military quietly for the first time ever just said
[03:19:22.077 --> 03:19:25.460]  I mean, it wasn't mutiny, because Obama is mutining against the country.
[03:19:25.660 --> 03:19:27.242]  They said, we're not backing ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[03:19:28.163 --> 03:19:29.524]  And why should we?
[03:19:29.584 --> 03:19:30.785]  That's the right thing to do.
[03:19:31.266 --> 03:19:32.327]  Why do we back terrorists?
[03:19:33.187 --> 03:19:34.969]  And South Korea was the group that attacked us.
[03:19:35.089 --> 03:19:35.970]  We're going to skip this break.
[03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:37.591]  We've only got a few minutes left here with our guests.
[03:19:37.631 --> 03:19:39.813]  Chris, I know you've got to go.
[03:19:40.154 --> 03:19:42.516]  Other points that are important to get out to people.
[03:19:44.458 --> 03:19:49.340]  We need to start sticking together, holding our politicians accountable, leading from the front instead of leading from behind.
[03:19:49.820 --> 03:19:50.900]  That's what we've been doing.
[03:19:50.940 --> 03:19:53.561]  We've got to go and destroy terrorism.
[03:19:53.821 --> 03:19:55.321]  We can't play around with it anymore.
[03:19:55.361 --> 03:19:57.622]  Stop giving money to these countries that sponsor terrorism.
[03:19:57.982 --> 03:19:59.142]  Go in there, get the troops.
[03:19:59.162 --> 03:20:05.644]  You've got SEALs, you've got Rangers, you've got Delta, you've got SFs, you've got all these warriors out there that want to go and bring the hammer, and you have to do that.
[03:20:06.825 --> 03:20:08.866]  If we don't, we're going to be fighting it on our home front.
[03:20:08.906 --> 03:20:09.467]  We already are.
[03:20:09.967 --> 03:20:11.008]  And it's just going to get worse.
[03:20:11.468 --> 03:20:14.511]  Let me ask you that question, because you got interrupted there by that break I just canceled.
[03:20:14.531 --> 03:20:14.871]  Sure, sure.
[03:20:15.411 --> 03:20:19.995]  Again, Chris, Tonto, Paranto.com is the website.
[03:20:20.055 --> 03:20:21.956]  The book, 13 hours, everyone should read it.
[03:20:22.617 --> 03:20:24.018]  I haven't read the book yet, but my friend has.
[03:20:24.078 --> 03:20:24.859]  I've got a copy now.
[03:20:24.879 --> 03:20:27.260]  They say there's even more in the book that isn't in the film.
[03:20:27.300 --> 03:20:27.881]  Is that accurate?
[03:20:28.101 --> 03:20:30.644]  Oh yeah, we have 13 hours in the book.
[03:20:30.684 --> 03:20:34.747]  It has everybody on the team's perspective except for Ty because he passed away that night.
[03:20:36.029 --> 03:20:39.872]  Getting 13 hours in a two-hour movie, you have to condense things.
[03:20:40.353 --> 03:20:49.902]  The movie did great, getting as much as it could into it, but the book is exactly what took place that night from everybody's perspective because the whole team were authors of that book.
[03:20:50.876 --> 03:20:52.457]  Incredible, absolutely amazing.
[03:20:52.717 --> 03:20:54.859]  Specifically getting back to our Pentagon.
[03:21:20.896 --> 03:21:28.680]  You know, as far as Syria goes, that country, we shouldn't have went in there and tried to overthrow Assad to begin with.
[03:21:29.581 --> 03:21:35.784]  We've done that with Gaddafi, we've done that with Assad, we're trying to do that with Assad, and we've turned these areas into terrorist training grounds.
[03:21:36.285 --> 03:21:37.165]  Backing ISIS?
[03:21:37.205 --> 03:21:37.926]  Are you kidding me?
[03:21:38.126 --> 03:21:39.346]  It's a terrorist organization.
[03:21:39.426 --> 03:21:44.549]  Why on earth would we, that's like backing al-Qaeda, backing al-Zaqqari when we were in Iraq.
[03:21:45.010 --> 03:21:46.931]  You go and you destroy these groups.
[03:21:48.843 --> 03:21:50.145]  We're terrorists.
[03:21:50.205 --> 03:21:51.928]  I mean, am I confused here, I guess?
[03:21:51.988 --> 03:21:56.336]  I think by the definition of terrorism, if we're backing terrorist activities, then are we terrorists now?
[03:21:57.793 --> 03:22:00.995]  People need to wake the heck up and realize what's going on here.
[03:22:01.776 --> 03:22:03.197]  We are a country of freedom.
[03:22:03.217 --> 03:22:04.178]  We're a country of strength.
[03:22:04.558 --> 03:22:07.340]  We're not a country of slaughtering Christians.
[03:22:07.560 --> 03:22:10.423]  We're not a country that go and indiscriminately slaughter children.
[03:22:10.623 --> 03:22:11.263]  It doesn't happen.
[03:22:11.584 --> 03:22:12.164]  Terrorists do.
[03:22:12.424 --> 03:22:16.327]  We need to step back and realize what the heck's going on here and wake up soon.
[03:22:17.048 --> 03:22:21.652]  I'm very scared for our country, but there are great people like you and Joe and like myself.
[03:22:22.092 --> 03:22:23.013]  There's people
[03:22:23.613 --> 03:22:26.457]  We've got warriors everywhere in the United States that are ready to step up.
[03:22:26.477 --> 03:22:26.837]  Totally.
[03:22:26.958 --> 03:22:32.885]  Well, I mean, look, your courage, your team's courage, the folks that, you know, put the book out, the film, this has now brought it to a head.
[03:22:32.945 --> 03:22:34.907]  Joe, I don't see how Hillary survives this.
[03:22:35.248 --> 03:22:39.313]  That's why even our own party's saying we might want to pull her back, but then we've got Bernie Sanders.
[03:22:39.333 --> 03:22:39.673]  I mean...
[03:22:41.724 --> 03:22:42.505]  Any points on that?
[03:22:43.125 --> 03:22:48.650]  I watch military movies all the time and I leave out of the theater angry because it was done so horribly.
[03:22:49.090 --> 03:22:53.334]  I left out of this movie angry because it was done right and I was angry for the right reasons.
[03:22:53.394 --> 03:23:00.260]  That our men and women get left, they get screwed over by our government when they swear an oath to uphold the Constitution and defend it.
[03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:19.610]  against enemies foreign and domestic and then they go out and they're putting their lives on the line and they get screwed over like that when there were clearly air assets that could have been there to help you guys out there would have been hardly any loss of life more loss of life on their bad side and here we are you know I'm just thankful you like you're one of my heroes man to be able to sit here and talk to you right now.
[03:23:19.630 --> 03:23:22.572]  I don't even know what to say right now.
[03:23:22.932 --> 03:23:28.915]  It's amazing well listen Chris I hope you'll come back again in the future what other projects are you working on right now?
[03:23:29.455 --> 03:23:33.779]  Well, right now, I'm a public speaker and I speak dang near everywhere.
[03:23:33.800 --> 03:23:36.422]  I'm five, four, five times a week in different states.
[03:23:37.763 --> 03:23:41.567]  Possibly, and I don't know if I will or not, but I've been asked to possibly write my own book.
[03:23:41.587 --> 03:23:43.189]  I don't know what people want to know about me.
[03:23:43.269 --> 03:23:44.951]  I'm nothing special.
[03:23:46.072 --> 03:23:50.176]  But if that goes on, if not, brother, just live and fight in a good fight.
[03:23:50.476 --> 03:23:51.177]  That's all I can do.
[03:23:51.417 --> 03:23:53.998]  We ought to bring him to Austin and speak here and have him on video.
[03:23:54.038 --> 03:23:54.398]  Heck yeah!
[03:23:54.758 --> 03:23:56.059]  I would love to come back to Austin.
[03:23:56.079 --> 03:23:57.940]  Did you lose your security clearance over that?
[03:23:58.480 --> 03:24:00.361]  No, not as far as I knew.
[03:24:01.261 --> 03:24:05.243]  But we were told that when you guys do the book, you cannot work with us anymore.
[03:24:05.303 --> 03:24:06.844]  With being us was the agency.
[03:24:07.664 --> 03:24:08.705]  That's a good question, Joe.
[03:24:09.085 --> 03:24:10.445]  If I did, I didn't get a letter yet.
[03:24:10.465 --> 03:24:11.466]  Let me ask you that question.
[03:24:12.810 --> 03:24:17.418]  The CIA saying stand down, you could be in harm's way and they say stand down again.
[03:24:17.438 --> 03:24:19.963]  I mean, do you think that's reflective of your experience?
[03:24:20.304 --> 03:24:21.486]  Or was this a one-time deal?
[03:24:22.608 --> 03:24:23.608]  That's pretty cold-blooded.
[03:24:23.788 --> 03:24:26.029]  You know, when I first started, no.
[03:24:26.409 --> 03:24:29.830]  I had some outstanding chiefs of bases, outstanding chiefs of station.
[03:24:30.590 --> 03:24:45.094]  As it continued on, and it's not a coincidence that it coincided with being eight years ago, when it started to get a little bit more politically correct, a little bit more wishy-washy, a little bit more, let's not offend the locals, into, hey, we gotta take care of our own people.
[03:24:45.134 --> 03:24:46.014]  That's not a coincidence.
[03:24:47.274 --> 03:24:50.915]  Nowadays, and again, I've been out now for two years, three years.
[03:24:50.955 --> 03:24:54.276]  I haven't deployed because of everything that went on.
[03:24:54.677 --> 03:25:01.179]  But I do remember it getting a little bit more touchy-feely and hands-off and not more of dropping the hammer when I first started.
[03:25:01.279 --> 03:25:10.522]  So I would say it's as typical now, probably, but since I'm not deploying, I haven't deployed for the last two years, I can't say with 100% certainty.
[03:25:11.209 --> 03:25:12.170]  We'll definitely have to go shooting.
[03:25:12.430 --> 03:25:13.591]  Get you out here with Dino Norm.
[03:25:13.911 --> 03:25:14.151]  Sure.
[03:25:14.211 --> 03:25:16.833]  Well, listen, in closing, we really appreciate your work.
[03:25:16.893 --> 03:25:17.954]  Everybody should see the film.
[03:25:18.334 --> 03:25:19.535]  They should also read the book.
[03:25:19.955 --> 03:25:22.577]  Once you leave here, though, you're going to think back and say, oh, I should have said this.
[03:25:22.777 --> 03:25:24.679]  Any other points that are important for folks?
[03:25:25.816 --> 03:25:28.438]  You know, honestly, I've said my piece at this point.
[03:25:28.978 --> 03:25:36.964]  Alex, if there's something else, believe me, I'll get in touch with you and I hope you'll have me back on the show and just, you know, God bless you all and keep that in your life, keep that faith.
[03:25:37.284 --> 03:25:38.245]  We can win this.
[03:25:38.265 --> 03:25:47.151]  We can get it back to where I knew us when I was growing up, which was patriotism, which was respect, and sermons are still being said and people are still opening doors for each other.
[03:25:47.191 --> 03:25:47.671]  Absolutely.
[03:25:47.711 --> 03:25:49.592]  This could bring down the criminals in our government.
[03:25:49.612 --> 03:25:51.053]  This could really take the Republic back.
[03:25:52.034 --> 03:25:53.895]  I mean, there's something really special about Benghazi.
[03:25:53.915 --> 03:25:54.795]  It's a horrible tragedy.
[03:25:55.035 --> 03:25:57.496]  We all see the best in people at the same time.
[03:25:57.536 --> 03:25:58.316]  It's really amazing.
[03:25:58.756 --> 03:25:59.497]  Chris, God bless you.
[03:25:59.517 --> 03:25:59.917]  Thank you, sir.
[03:26:00.417 --> 03:26:00.937]  Thank you, sir.
[03:26:01.177 --> 03:26:01.637]  Thanks, Joe.
[03:26:01.998 --> 03:26:02.358]  Thank you.
[03:26:02.538 --> 03:26:02.758]  All right.
[03:26:02.778 --> 03:26:04.218]  Well, that was a powerful interview.
[03:26:04.258 --> 03:26:04.679]  And you're right.
[03:26:04.719 --> 03:26:10.321]  I mean, I mean, just the words you describe, you see the worst in people with the globalists and Hillary and Obama and the scum.
[03:26:11.081 --> 03:26:15.062]  They're caught with their pants down, Joe, nakedly in front of everybody.
[03:26:16.283 --> 03:26:16.803]  And then now.
[03:26:18.063 --> 03:26:19.364]  They try to suppress it, but it didn't work.
[03:26:21.138 --> 03:26:27.104]  Yeah, there's a great awakening going on, and I'm just glad people are standing up in the military and coming out and talking about this stuff.
[03:26:27.164 --> 03:26:39.197]  I mean, like the Navy SEAL I interviewed the other day, Carl Higby, he actually went on Fox & Friends and was talking about the corruption within the administration, Obama's administration.
[03:26:40.314 --> 03:26:45.437]  And as he was getting out, they contacted him and said, oh, we're going to not give you an honorable discharge.
[03:26:45.457 --> 03:26:46.798]  It's going to be an other than honorable now.
[03:26:47.218 --> 03:26:50.961]  Because he came forward and started speaking about the atrocities going on.
[03:26:50.981 --> 03:26:53.722]  I noticed Megyn Kelly, she's going, oh, it was an accident.
[03:26:54.143 --> 03:26:56.084]  I see they didn't know why they ordered to stand out.
[03:26:56.124 --> 03:26:57.345]  He goes, no, it was on purpose.
[03:26:57.805 --> 03:26:58.605]  It's the same guy, right?
[03:26:58.625 --> 03:26:59.806]  No, no, this is a different one.
[03:26:59.826 --> 03:27:04.509]  This is the guy that was the, uh, the guy that took in the butcher of Fallujah, the bad guy.
[03:27:04.549 --> 03:27:04.869]  Oh, sure.
[03:27:06.869 --> 03:27:09.470]  So that was the bad guy that Chris Kyle was going after, an American sniper.
[03:27:09.510 --> 03:27:11.471]  That's who Carl Higby actually was able to capture.
[03:27:11.491 --> 03:27:12.672]  So they just persecuted all these guys?
[03:27:13.052 --> 03:27:13.212]  Yeah.
[03:27:13.332 --> 03:27:18.415]  Well what about the other SEALs that were on the show, you know, talking about how, no, no, this isn't by accident, this was done on purpose.
[03:27:18.695 --> 03:27:18.875]  Yeah.
[03:27:19.435 --> 03:27:28.340]  And those guys, some people, like he said, like Chris said, some people are going to stay in the system and they're going to sit there and live with that lie just so they can make money, just so they can continue on.
[03:27:28.360 --> 03:27:29.861]  Well I want to warn those people because
[03:27:30.521 --> 03:27:35.943]  I've talked to a lot of folks who were, you know, in Special Ops back when it wasn't as large as it is.
[03:27:36.343 --> 03:27:42.745]  I mean, quite frankly, older Special Ops will say these are even better Special Ops now because they see so much combat, so much action.
[03:27:42.986 --> 03:27:44.946]  This is like superhero stuff now, what they do.
[03:27:45.426 --> 03:27:48.508]  But back in the day, it was almost more, you know, cloak and dagger spy stuff.
[03:27:48.528 --> 03:27:48.988]  Still is.
[03:27:49.848 --> 03:27:54.770]  But that Green Berets and Navy SEALs and other Special Ops guys have done a bunch of dirty work.
[03:27:55.917 --> 03:27:58.438]  They're 30, 40, 50 years old, they send somebody to kill you.
[03:27:58.798 --> 03:28:06.401]  And folks need to know, listen, even if you serve them and do dirty stuff, they put you in that file, they come and they kill you.
[03:28:06.881 --> 03:28:07.241]  Okay?
[03:28:07.561 --> 03:28:09.302]  And you need to understand, they do it.
[03:28:09.782 --> 03:28:18.526]  And so the only way I've found to be safe from researching all this is to speak out and expose it so there aren't any secrets so they have a reason to kill you, Joe.
[03:28:18.846 --> 03:28:24.388]  Well, I'm scared for our Special Forces community right now, quite frankly, because right now we have
[03:28:25.248 --> 03:28:28.430]  A lowering of standards that is happening under the Obama administration.
[03:28:28.470 --> 03:28:30.691]  We have women being allowed to come into combat.
[03:28:30.711 --> 03:28:34.814]  We have women taking over combat leadership positions in ranger battalions.
[03:28:35.214 --> 03:28:38.356]  We have three SEALs who have just died in training.
[03:28:38.396 --> 03:28:39.116]  What's going to happen?
[03:28:39.376 --> 03:28:43.259]  We have these people in these high-level positions that are so politically correct.
[03:28:43.459 --> 03:28:48.382]  I'm in fear of the fact that they're going to lower the standard of BUDs for SEAL training to become a Navy SEAL.
[03:28:48.402 --> 03:28:49.422]  They're already saying they want to.
[03:28:49.502 --> 03:28:51.524]  And if they do that, what happens to our Tier 1
[03:28:52.444 --> 03:29:02.072]  Operators, what's going to happen when you go into combat with an already team that's been with the older way of doing it the right way and you start bringing in, ushering in some of these drop standard people?
[03:29:02.112 --> 03:29:03.413]  You're going to have more loss of life.
[03:29:03.734 --> 03:29:06.376]  We're going to look like more soldiers walking around on high hills.
[03:29:06.436 --> 03:29:07.437]  I'm scared for the future.
[03:29:07.897 --> 03:29:09.559]  It's all meant to destroy the country, Joe.
[03:29:09.579 --> 03:29:14.563]  People keep saying, this is destroying us, shutting off our power plants, telling us moms and dads are bad.
[03:29:14.663 --> 03:29:16.765]  Yes, they're trying to sabotage us.
[03:29:17.245 --> 03:29:18.346]  We're being destroyed.
[03:29:18.386 --> 03:29:19.367]  It's a globalist program.
[03:29:19.748 --> 03:29:20.549]  David Knight's coming up.
[03:29:20.589 --> 03:29:25.414]  I want you and I to hand the baton to David here, hosting the fourth hour.
[03:29:25.434 --> 03:29:29.298]  And I really want to appreciate you getting Chris on the program.
[03:29:29.338 --> 03:29:30.479]  He seems like a really neat guy.
[03:29:30.659 --> 03:29:30.879]  Oh yeah.
[03:29:31.120 --> 03:29:31.560]  Amazing guy.
[03:29:31.580 --> 03:29:34.003]  He's really good friends with some of my buddies here that I shoot with.
[03:29:35.111 --> 03:29:35.632]  Absolutely.
[03:29:35.652 --> 03:29:37.714]  You know, I was talking to Tim Kennedy when he went and saw that film.
[03:29:37.734 --> 03:29:42.238]  He said it was so realistic from what he's seen, what he's experienced, that he just couldn't sleep that night.
[03:29:42.419 --> 03:29:42.959]  Yeah, I was there too.
[03:29:42.979 --> 03:29:43.980]  It was absolutely horrible.
[03:29:44.561 --> 03:29:49.205]  And just to think that this all went on and they stood down in front of all the drone footage.
[03:29:49.506 --> 03:29:51.568]  The military all knows what really happened.
[03:29:51.688 --> 03:29:52.589]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.069 --> 03:29:54.671]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.592 --> 03:29:58.275]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.759 --> 03:30:11.788]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:30:11.849 --> 03:30:19.957]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:30:20.257 --> 03:30:24.939]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:30:25.119 --> 03:30:31.862]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:30:31.922 --> 03:30:39.006]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:30:39.086 --> 03:30:45.949]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:30:46.109 --> 03:30:50.472]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:30:50.593 --> 03:30:53.855]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:30:53.995 --> 03:31:00.120]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:31:00.280 --> 03:31:01.961]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[03:31:04.209 --> 03:31:09.193]  Caitlyn Jenner experienced sex change regret might de-transition, biographer says.
[03:31:09.453 --> 03:31:11.015]  It hasn't been easy for Caitlyn.
[03:31:11.175 --> 03:31:12.156]  It's been very hard.
[03:31:12.176 --> 03:31:17.921]  Ian Halperin recalls one source telling him, well, you are a dude dressed like a lady.
[03:31:18.181 --> 03:31:19.402]  Dude looks like a lady!
[03:31:20.162 --> 03:31:25.606]  Caitlin Jenner, who announced her transition from man to woman last year, has considered de-transitioning.
[03:31:25.786 --> 03:31:29.909]  The author of a new book about the Kardashian family told The Wrap on Wednesday.
[03:31:29.929 --> 03:31:41.938]  Ian Halperin, the author of Kardashian Dynasty, the controversial rise of America's royal family, thanks to all you crazy leftists who want to ban freedom, have made these kind of people celebrities.
[03:31:42.058 --> 03:31:42.658]  Thank you.
[03:31:42.958 --> 03:31:46.521]  One source confirmed to me, Caitlin has made whispers of sex change regret.
[03:31:46.761 --> 03:31:48.184]  You didn't even change sex!
[03:31:48.244 --> 03:31:50.428]  You're a guy with a dress on!
[03:31:50.568 --> 03:31:52.071]  Get with the program, dude!
[03:31:52.091 --> 03:31:53.172]  You're delusional!
[03:31:53.333 --> 03:31:54.435]  Put on some shorts!
[03:31:54.615 --> 03:31:57.400]  Get a tank top, eat some Wheaties, and go for a jog!
[03:31:57.520 --> 03:31:59.243]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com
[03:32:02.699 --> 03:32:05.303]  We could have saved Navy SEALs in Benghazi.
[03:32:05.463 --> 03:32:09.308]  F-16 pilots in Italy were on standby to help besiege U.S.
[03:32:09.388 --> 03:32:12.672]  forces in Libya, but the order to launch never came.
[03:32:12.913 --> 03:32:13.413]  A U.S.
[03:32:13.493 --> 03:32:19.141]  Air Force source has claimed that a squadron of attack jets was being armed and fueled on the night of the deadly attack.
[03:32:19.301 --> 03:32:30.406]  On the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012, the jets, believed to be F-16s, were on the runway, ready to launch, as terrorists bombarded the U.S.
[03:32:30.446 --> 03:32:32.847]  consulate, killing four Americans.
[03:32:33.048 --> 03:32:44.873]  The source claims the fighters could have launched from Aviano Air Force Base in northern Italy and refueled at Naval Air Station Sigonella before providing air support over Benghazi.
[03:32:45.073 --> 03:32:48.115]  And yet, all we hear is Hillary Clinton saying,
[03:32:48.755 --> 03:32:50.697]  What difference at this point does it make?
[03:32:50.897 --> 03:32:56.382]  She is the most vile, un-American human being to ever live.
[03:32:56.522 --> 03:32:58.985]  She is pure evil in the flesh.
[03:32:59.225 --> 03:33:01.887]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[03:33:06.111 --> 03:33:06.972]  Breaking the law.
[03:33:07.353 --> 03:33:08.053]  Breaking the law.
[03:33:10.716 --> 03:33:11.417]  The answer to 1984.
[03:33:13.604 --> 03:33:15.206]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:15.506 --> 03:33:22.013]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.488 --> 03:33:27.949]  Sometimes people take screenshots of me doing my fist and they go, look he's a communist.
[03:33:28.409 --> 03:33:31.370]  The clenched fist is the oldest form of the symbol of resistance.
[03:33:31.850 --> 03:33:35.030]  Why the communists get to like expropriate it for themselves, I have no idea.
[03:33:35.330 --> 03:33:35.931]  It's not yours.
[03:33:36.691 --> 03:33:38.811]  It's like Hitler expropriating the fascist salute.
[03:33:39.011 --> 03:33:39.951]  That's like a Roman deal.
[03:33:40.491 --> 03:33:44.312]  You know, like Native Americans have the swastika, now it can't be used because you know Hitler's got it.
[03:33:45.813 --> 03:33:47.113]  It's all political correctness, but...
[03:33:47.933 --> 03:33:48.654]  Joe Biggs is here.
[03:33:48.694 --> 03:33:49.194]  I'm finishing up.
[03:33:49.214 --> 03:33:50.235]  We're about to go to David Knight.
[03:33:50.615 --> 03:33:53.557]  He did a great job hosting for me Tuesday when I had some family issues come up.
[03:33:54.298 --> 03:33:56.399]  And then I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:33:57.100 --> 03:33:58.221]  Central Standard Time.
[03:33:58.881 --> 03:34:01.723]  But I got a bunch of clips here I didn't get to that I need to play.
[03:34:01.824 --> 03:34:10.350]  I mean, Clinton laughs at her introducer when the woman goes, one nation under, and she's self-censored and everybody laughs.
[03:34:10.730 --> 03:34:11.431]  This is a cult.
[03:34:11.471 --> 03:34:12.371]  This is mind control.
[03:34:13.172 --> 03:34:15.354]  And then she, you know, laughs approvingly and we've got
[03:34:16.345 --> 03:34:24.088]  The other mind control cult, you know, saying that Trump on Fox & Friends, we have a president that won't acknowledge the term radical Islam.
[03:34:24.828 --> 03:34:30.171]  This is how they literally try to manipulate people into not having free speech.
[03:34:30.691 --> 03:34:31.451]  Here's another one.
[03:34:31.511 --> 03:34:37.614]  Stephen Hayes calls Trump orange guy, so that's making fun of gingers, who wants to ban a religion, Islam.
[03:34:37.674 --> 03:34:40.555]  No, Islam wants to ban everybody else's religion.
[03:34:41.275 --> 03:34:44.058]  So again, they just keep inverting reality.
[03:34:44.159 --> 03:34:47.222]  And I have the left running around saying, I'm Islamophobic.
[03:34:48.103 --> 03:34:50.286]  Well, I'm not Islamophobic against the Muslims.
[03:34:50.346 --> 03:34:54.350]  I know that don't make their wives or daughters wear beekeeper suits.
[03:34:55.031 --> 03:34:57.154]  And I'm sorry, folks, a flower sack over your head.
[03:34:58.519 --> 03:35:01.200]  They beat the women, they kill them if they don't do it.
[03:35:01.500 --> 03:35:02.480]  They make them do it.
[03:35:02.620 --> 03:35:03.460]  That's slavery.
[03:35:03.741 --> 03:35:04.141]  Got it?
[03:35:04.381 --> 03:35:12.723]  People go, if a woman, like Huffington Post yesterday, it's so beautiful, a lot of non-Muslims are wearing headdresses and headjobs and just to show solidarity.
[03:35:13.623 --> 03:35:17.725]  It's like, I'm gonna go wear a chain around my neck and go, we should bring back black slavery, a solidarity.
[03:35:18.325 --> 03:35:19.985]  Joe Biggs, David Knight, jump in.
[03:35:20.926 --> 03:35:21.406]  I don't get it.
[03:35:21.446 --> 03:35:23.106]  I mean, I think it's completely ridiculous.
[03:35:23.146 --> 03:35:25.507]  I mean, we're racist for not wanting
[03:35:27.159 --> 03:35:28.360]  Sharia law in our country.
[03:35:28.420 --> 03:35:34.965]  We're racist because we don't want, you know, our women to be harassed because of the way we dress in our culture.
[03:35:35.145 --> 03:35:36.026]  They're not your women!
[03:35:36.046 --> 03:35:37.267]  They belong to the Jihad!
[03:35:38.186 --> 03:35:50.975]  You know, I've told this story before, I've seen women who've gone to the United Arab Emirates and they will dress conservatively, not showing their legs, you know, blouse that covers everything up, and try to adhere to their culture.
[03:35:51.275 --> 03:35:59.622]  But then when they go back home into London or wherever, they're spit on, called a whore, whatever it may be, by these Arabs in those areas who've moved into these
[03:36:00.342 --> 03:36:01.283]  Well, look, here's the deal.
[03:36:01.303 --> 03:36:06.207]  There's a lot of woman-hating going on over there, and I love to spoil rotten, not
[03:36:15.475 --> 03:36:16.796]  Oh, that's loving when they talk to him.
[03:36:31.144 --> 03:36:39.251]  Well, you know, Alex, you're talking about these videos where we've got the clip of the lady who self-censors because she almost says the word God and the pledge and she's got to pull that back.
[03:36:39.291 --> 03:36:40.492]  They can't say radical Islam.
[03:36:40.972 --> 03:36:48.918]  But at the same time, we've now had Obama today do potty all over the United States, telling us how we're going to go to the bathroom.
[03:36:49.119 --> 03:36:50.360]  I mean, this is a level of social control.
[03:36:50.380 --> 03:36:51.861]  Excuse me, I missed this new breaking stuff.
[03:36:51.881 --> 03:36:53.082]  He told us we had a pee-pee?
[03:36:53.742 --> 03:36:54.343]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:36:54.403 --> 03:37:01.607]  We're going to be told how we're going to have to go to the bathroom, how our bathrooms are going to operate, what they're doing to... Oh, you mean going after, yeah, yeah.
[03:37:01.667 --> 03:37:02.167]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:37:02.247 --> 03:37:04.108]  Really, it's about teaching kids about transgender.
[03:37:04.128 --> 03:37:07.250]  It's about making school all about obsessing over potty time.
[03:37:07.570 --> 03:37:08.831]  It's a total mental illness weapon.
[03:37:09.031 --> 03:37:11.434]  Yeah, this is something people need to understand.
[03:37:11.794 --> 03:37:15.238]  The Department of Education has been about social control.
[03:37:15.318 --> 03:37:22.746]  This is a brave new world, Plato's Republic type of social control, social engineering that's been going on for quite some time.
[03:37:23.047 --> 03:37:24.008]  That's the purpose of it.
[03:37:24.048 --> 03:37:30.034]  They get you hooked on the money, and then they say, well, we're going to pull the money if you don't do exactly what we've said.
[03:37:30.815 --> 03:37:33.277]  First, it's Michelle's gonna tell you what you eat.
[03:37:33.337 --> 03:37:34.418]  We'll fine you if you don't.
[03:37:34.478 --> 03:37:35.519]  Well, that's not cult-like.
[03:37:35.659 --> 03:37:39.041]  Now we're gonna teach your five-year-olds about their sexuality.
[03:37:39.221 --> 03:37:40.362]  Oh, that's called pedophilia.
[03:37:41.183 --> 03:37:42.824]  I mean, what's coming next, David?
[03:37:42.844 --> 03:37:43.965]  What do you guys predict next?
[03:37:44.285 --> 03:37:53.932]  Well, actually, Alex, we had a very strong statement today from the lieutenant governor here in Texas, who came out and said, they said they're gonna pull money from us if we don't
[03:37:54.492 --> 03:37:58.716]  Uh, let, uh, have single-sex bathrooms and single-sex showers and stuff.
[03:37:58.837 --> 03:37:59.117]  Fine.
[03:37:59.337 --> 03:37:59.597]  Do it.
[03:37:59.637 --> 03:38:00.678]  We're not going to be blackmailed.
[03:38:00.878 --> 03:38:07.145]  And he says, you have to understand that the money that we're getting from the federal government, most of that is going to the lunch program.
[03:38:07.185 --> 03:38:09.887]  So not only are you going to be trying to... Take the food away from us.
[03:38:09.947 --> 03:38:11.589]  Take the Michelle rotten prison food.
[03:38:11.769 --> 03:38:11.969]  Yeah.
[03:38:12.029 --> 03:38:12.209]  Good.
[03:38:12.229 --> 03:38:13.190]  Who needs that stuff anyways?
[03:38:13.210 --> 03:38:23.015]  We should all have an emergency community fund to have real lunches and stuff for the poor kids and make a whole stunt out of it and show the luscious delicious food next to the rat-filled dropping garbage.
[03:38:23.055 --> 03:38:25.676]  That was one of my favorite articles that Kit Daniels did.
[03:38:25.696 --> 03:38:30.359]  He had the pictures of all the different, the meals from these high schools and middle schools or whatever.
[03:38:30.399 --> 03:38:32.860]  People were treating up Michelle's food and just like
[03:38:33.280 --> 03:38:34.661]  Horrible prison food.
[03:38:34.801 --> 03:38:36.242]  Full of rat droppings.
[03:38:37.203 --> 03:38:38.003]  Moldy bread.
[03:38:38.043 --> 03:38:40.785]  I mean, what the... Because it's all a joke for their insiders.
[03:38:40.805 --> 03:38:47.070]  Like their energy deals are giving tens of billions a month to a few select globalist companies to build magic windmills that don't even work.
[03:38:47.610 --> 03:38:50.672]  I mean, it's scam after scam after scam.
[03:38:50.712 --> 03:38:52.333]  David, I'm going to hand the baton to you, my friend.
[03:38:52.353 --> 03:38:55.676]  And I want to invite you this Sunday, if you'd like to come in and co-host with me.
[03:38:55.696 --> 03:38:58.398]  Because today you kind of got cut short on the Sunday broadcast.
[03:38:58.418 --> 03:38:59.979]  So you'll kind of have a roundtable discussion.
[03:39:00.219 --> 03:39:01.180]  Sunday four to six.
[03:39:01.260 --> 03:39:01.660]  You want to do it?
[03:39:01.880 --> 03:39:02.080]  Sure.
[03:39:02.220 --> 03:39:02.480]  Oh, yeah.
[03:39:02.681 --> 03:39:03.181]  Fantastic.
[03:39:03.221 --> 03:39:03.561]  We'll do it.
[03:39:04.041 --> 03:39:05.042]  And Biggs, you can come in, too.
[03:39:05.863 --> 03:39:07.904]  But, you know, that guest snuck up on me.
[03:39:07.944 --> 03:39:08.985]  I forgot I had that guest.
[03:39:09.005 --> 03:39:11.086]  And then all of a sudden, they're like, the guest is ready to go.
[03:39:11.146 --> 03:39:12.867]  They're like, I'm like, where's Biggs?
[03:39:12.907 --> 03:39:13.448]  I forgot.
[03:39:13.508 --> 03:39:14.809]  He usually comes on like five after.
[03:39:15.209 --> 03:39:16.450]  And then I'm like, get Biggs in here.
[03:39:16.470 --> 03:39:17.430]  No, don't get Biggs in here.
[03:39:17.470 --> 03:39:18.171]  But he got in here.
[03:39:18.191 --> 03:39:20.232]  He did a great job interviewing that guy.
[03:39:20.252 --> 03:39:21.013]  What an amazing interview.
[03:39:21.033 --> 03:39:22.274]  I want to get your take on that.
[03:39:22.334 --> 03:39:24.255]  And then I'm going to hand the baton to David Knight.
[03:39:24.275 --> 03:39:26.637]  But briefly, I didn't even really plug the third hour.
[03:39:27.117 --> 03:39:31.260]  I'm supposed to plug twice an hour for the sponsors we have in our own products.
[03:39:32.000 --> 03:39:34.701]  And instead I plug like once an hour and then skip breaks.
[03:39:34.761 --> 03:39:35.462]  It's out of control.
[03:39:35.502 --> 03:39:38.943]  Then I complain about having money to go to Bilderberg or money to cover this or that.
[03:39:39.604 --> 03:39:41.285]  The truth is it takes a lot of money to run this operation.
[03:39:41.325 --> 03:39:42.885]  We sell the very best products that are out there.
[03:39:42.945 --> 03:39:45.347]  It ends this Sunday.
[03:39:46.067 --> 03:39:47.968]  We already had all the food 30 to 40 percent off.
[03:39:48.268 --> 03:39:50.049]  Now it's the four top best sellers.
[03:39:50.549 --> 03:39:53.051]  of high quality storable food with all the things happening in the world.
[03:39:53.351 --> 03:39:54.391]  It lasts 25 years.
[03:39:54.712 --> 03:39:56.273]  This is the food I've chosen for my family.
[03:39:56.353 --> 03:39:56.973]  It's excellent.
[03:39:57.413 --> 03:39:59.034]  InfoWars Select is what it's called.

[03:40:07.400 --> 03:40:09.861]  But this InfoWars Select special, you cannot beat it.
[03:40:10.262 --> 03:40:16.786]  And the way this food is contained in these high quality plastic sealed tote containers and then sealed within packages and cans within
[03:40:18.041 --> 03:40:19.761]  Is the very best you're going to find out there.
[03:40:19.861 --> 03:40:20.902]  It really is a great deal.
[03:40:21.322 --> 03:40:22.582]  And they want us dependent.
[03:40:22.642 --> 03:40:24.782]  Now is the time to get self-sufficient.
[03:40:25.042 --> 03:40:29.263]  And even if you're self-sufficient for yourself, it's good to have some backup food to help friends and family.
[03:40:29.523 --> 03:40:32.024]  It has a 4.8 star review.
[03:40:32.644 --> 03:40:36.824]  Thousands and thousands of reviews are 5.0 on the site, but it's on average 4.8.
[03:40:38.205 --> 03:40:39.585]  Third-party power reviews.
[03:40:39.945 --> 03:40:44.426]  We also have Vitamin Mineral Fusion back in from InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:40:45.740 --> 03:40:49.343]  All the minerals, all the vitamins, the cofactors, the amino acids.
[03:40:49.643 --> 03:40:51.665]  You absorb so much of this than you do with pills.
[03:40:52.405 --> 03:40:53.546]  It's what I give my children.
[03:40:54.387 --> 03:40:59.471]  I'm losing more weight again, you know, not wanting orange juice or the sugar drinks, but still getting my vitamins drinking this.
[03:40:59.992 --> 03:41:00.852]  It is so good.
[03:41:01.353 --> 03:41:02.173]  Folks love it.
[03:41:02.514 --> 03:41:03.915]  Try a container of it.
[03:41:03.955 --> 03:41:04.876]  It's concentrated.
[03:41:05.656 --> 03:41:07.538]  It's extremely competitively priced.

[03:41:22.123 --> 03:41:24.343]  This is all just amazing stuff that I use every day.
[03:41:24.683 --> 03:41:25.924]  We set out to have the very best
[03:41:26.564 --> 03:41:27.024]  We're good to go.
[03:41:45.871 --> 03:41:48.292]  The original sold out because it was limited edition.
[03:41:48.332 --> 03:41:50.914]  We have a new one that's very similar, that's very popular.
[03:41:50.974 --> 03:41:52.215]  And Joe, it's crazy.
[03:41:52.535 --> 03:41:53.815]  You've gone all over the country now.
[03:41:54.136 --> 03:41:58.998]  It's gone from 1 in 20 people with Hillary for President to like 1 in 10 now, 1 in 5.
[03:41:59.358 --> 03:42:00.399]  Trump's freaking out.
[03:42:00.939 --> 03:42:02.960]  We're showing how many info warriors there are.
[03:42:03.321 --> 03:42:05.182]  And the little profit we make off each shirt
[03:42:05.862 --> 03:42:12.047]  ...is absolutely essential put together, becomes a large profit to be able to fund this operation.
[03:42:12.087 --> 03:42:13.128]  So, great job folks.
[03:42:13.428 --> 03:42:15.010]  A brief comment on the Hillary for Prison shirts.
[03:42:15.030 --> 03:42:28.281]  Well, I actually started a trending Twitter topic last night, Handcuff Hillary, and people were sending me all their pictures of themselves wearing the Hillary for Prison t-shirt, and I saved them on my phone and then started tweeting them out with Handcuff Hillary, and I... Oh, I forgot!
[03:42:28.301 --> 03:42:29.142]  That's why I'm... Yeah, yeah.
[03:42:29.562 --> 03:42:32.543]  Tell folks about that hashtag, how we tweet it, how we Facebook it.
[03:42:32.603 --> 03:42:37.845]  To hashtag it, go to Twitter, handcuffHillary, a capital H, capital C, and then capital H for Hillary as well.
[03:42:37.865 --> 03:42:38.786]  You do that on Facebook.
[03:42:39.086 --> 03:42:40.787]  You can use it on Instagram, anything like that.
[03:42:41.207 --> 03:42:43.748]  And put on your Hillary for Prison t-shirt, let us see it.
[03:42:44.048 --> 03:42:48.710]  Let everyone know because, you know, people that work for Hillary, they're watching that, they're seeing that, and they're telling her about it.
[03:42:48.890 --> 03:42:55.913]  And they're going to see everyone in America, all the people that wear this shirt and support us, and that's just going to piss her off even more, which makes me happy a little bit more inside.
[03:42:56.784 --> 03:42:57.485]  Absolutely.
[03:42:57.665 --> 03:42:59.627]  And again, we tweeted that at Real Alex Jones.
[03:42:59.647 --> 03:43:00.748]  I want everybody to retweet it.
[03:43:01.148 --> 03:43:03.410]  It is so important to get that information out.
[03:43:03.731 --> 03:43:04.011]  All right.
[03:43:04.071 --> 03:43:05.072]  Great job, Joe Biggs.
[03:43:05.292 --> 03:43:05.632]  Thank you, sir.
[03:43:05.753 --> 03:43:07.955]  And I guess if you won't come in this Sunday, you're probably hunting or something.
[03:43:07.995 --> 03:43:08.956]  Are you going to join us this Sunday?
[03:43:09.036 --> 03:43:09.416]  Yeah, I'm down.
[03:43:09.636 --> 03:43:09.877]  All right.
[03:43:09.897 --> 03:43:10.737]  4 to 6 p.m.
[03:43:11.298 --> 03:43:15.041]  David Knight will be hosting with us in the first hour and the second hour.
[03:43:15.502 --> 03:43:18.024]  And so I just tricked you both into giving me a Sunday vacation.
[03:43:20.186 --> 03:43:23.147]  No, no, actually, actually I want to come in on Sunday.
[03:43:23.167 --> 03:43:31.329]  And then some family stuff came up where it was going to be very hard for me to get here by 3 o'clock to get ready.
[03:43:31.369 --> 03:43:35.471]  So what I'll now do is let David Knight and you get ready and then I'll show up and mail it in.
[03:43:35.911 --> 03:43:37.171]  But not because I don't want to be here.
[03:43:37.211 --> 03:43:40.332]  I mean, I'll be up here like it's Saturday night and I catch you up here working too.
[03:43:40.592 --> 03:43:43.673]  The problem is workaholic behavior, but I've got to spend time with my kids.
[03:43:43.933 --> 03:43:44.653]  And so does David.
[03:43:44.893 --> 03:43:46.054]  And you need some kids, Biggs.
[03:43:46.354 --> 03:43:46.714]  Negative.
[03:43:47.795 --> 03:43:53.340]  My kids are Chris Vector, Glock 19, my Glock 45 ACP.
[03:43:53.360 --> 03:43:54.041]  Those are my babies.
[03:43:54.061 --> 03:43:57.864]  That's where I cuddle with them every night, clean them, make sure they're good, give them baths.
[03:43:58.265 --> 03:43:59.746]  That way they work for me when I need them.
[03:43:59.786 --> 03:44:02.529]  This is my rifle, this is my gun, this is for fighting, this is for fun?
[03:44:02.649 --> 03:44:03.670]  Yeah, I like the fun part more.
[03:44:05.031 --> 03:44:05.552]  Exactly.
[03:44:06.032 --> 03:44:09.315]  All right, David Knight, you take over, my friend.
[03:44:09.355 --> 03:44:09.975]  Thank you.
[03:44:09.995 --> 03:44:11.356]  What a power-packed transmission.
[03:44:11.717 --> 03:44:12.557]  That's how I'm going to leave it.
[03:44:13.158 --> 03:44:16.781]  What did you think of that amazing Army Ranger assigned to the CIA?
[03:44:16.801 --> 03:44:20.524]  The other people were Marines and SEALs that night that took on hundreds.
[03:44:20.684 --> 03:44:21.965]  Those guys always want to dial it back.
[03:44:22.005 --> 03:44:23.466]  I'll have, like, famous Navy SEALs on.
[03:44:23.486 --> 03:44:28.210]  They go, I was in the Navy SEALs and in Beirut and some stuff, but I'm nothing compared to the new people.
[03:44:28.230 --> 03:44:30.372]  I almost don't want to be called a SEAL.
[03:44:30.692 --> 03:44:31.913]  I'm not going to steal glory.
[03:44:32.233 --> 03:44:38.838]  And then that guy's like, now I really didn't do anything, and there shouldn't be a book about me, and uh, it was only 50 to 70 at a time.
[03:44:39.258 --> 03:44:45.022]  And I just forget how many I shot, but yeah, it was every few seconds I shot one, but let's just say we only killed 50, and we only fought 70.
[03:44:45.803 --> 03:44:48.205]  But then a lot of the numbers were like 400 guys they were fighting.
[03:44:48.445 --> 03:44:49.726]  We need more people like that though.
[03:44:49.766 --> 03:44:56.651]  No, but I know, but at a certain point it almost becomes so humble that you don't even get what happened, because they're just like not talking about it.
[03:44:57.431 --> 03:44:59.173]  I mean, how many do you think they really fought there?
[03:44:59.653 --> 03:45:03.336]  I mean, like you said, probably conservatively 50 to 70 at a time per wave.
[03:45:03.816 --> 03:45:06.238]  So I'm assuming, you know, in the hundreds overall.
[03:45:06.618 --> 03:45:09.761]  Well, there were guys in Korea platoons that fought like a thousand people.
[03:45:09.921 --> 03:45:10.101]  Yeah.
[03:45:10.561 --> 03:45:11.362]  So can you imagine that?
[03:45:11.882 --> 03:45:14.404]  I mean, my dad told me some stories from Nam that just blew my mind.
[03:45:15.543 --> 03:45:20.789]  Things that made me scared to even want to join the military, but then I just felt like it was my duty, especially when 9-11 happened.
[03:45:21.150 --> 03:45:27.277]  Well, they had, like, basically untrained Chinese troops that would do million-man wave attacks, and then you'd have, like...
[03:45:28.602 --> 03:45:36.727]  10,000 Army, a couple thousand Marines, and it was just like dead bodies, like in the movie 300, you know, where it's fictionally piled up like 160 feet or whatever.
[03:45:36.967 --> 03:45:41.570]  There were bodies piled 20, 30 feet tall that they were then using as their new hills to shoot over.
[03:45:41.810 --> 03:45:42.430]  Yeah.
[03:45:42.491 --> 03:45:44.512]  I mean, and the barrels are melting off.
[03:45:44.972 --> 03:45:46.893]  Anyways, we need to put women in frontline combat.
[03:45:46.913 --> 03:45:47.574]  That's the answer.
[03:45:48.374 --> 03:45:50.095]  Seriously, go ahead and take over, my friend.
[03:45:50.115 --> 03:45:51.176]  Thank you so much, David Knight.
[03:45:51.736 --> 03:45:52.237]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:45:52.257 --> 03:46:02.789]  You know, one of the things that I would be interested to hear from him, because he does a lot of public speaking, and he's got a list of public speaking topics that he approaches.
[03:46:02.809 --> 03:46:03.970]  That's Chris Paranto.
[03:46:04.744 --> 03:46:08.627]  One of the things I'd like to hear him talk about is his internal battle that he fought.
[03:46:09.227 --> 03:46:12.230]  Because he had, and you see this in the movie, 13 Hours.
[03:46:12.310 --> 03:46:16.633]  For a very long time, they're being told they can't go help people, they have to stand down.
[03:46:17.194 --> 03:46:22.277]  And they have this internal conflict that he talks about, how he's been trained to follow orders.
[03:46:23.098 --> 03:46:25.500]  Because you can't second-guess the chain of command.
[03:46:25.560 --> 03:46:33.226]  And yet, he has these internal moral beliefs, his Christian beliefs, that tell him that he has to go save innocent lives.
[03:46:33.286 --> 03:46:35.767]  And so that is a key part of the movie, I think.
[03:46:35.928 --> 03:46:37.108]  That's a very important part of the movie.
[03:46:37.569 --> 03:46:39.890]  And he does go out and talk about God and combat.
[03:46:39.971 --> 03:46:41.151]  I really respect that.
[03:46:41.712 --> 03:46:43.353]  This is a guy who is highly principled.
[03:46:43.653 --> 03:46:48.377]  We heard that when he talked about how a lot of people put their continuing employment
[03:46:49.057 --> 03:46:52.621]  Above talking about how others were betrayed and died.
[03:46:52.701 --> 03:46:55.263]  And we're all going to have those moral choices more and more in our lives.
[03:46:55.304 --> 03:46:55.644]  That's right.
[03:46:55.944 --> 03:46:56.224]  That's right.
[03:46:56.244 --> 03:46:58.166]  When they tell us take a chip or you can't buy or sell.
[03:46:58.226 --> 03:46:59.187]  I mean it's coming down to that.
[03:46:59.448 --> 03:46:59.788]  That's right.
[03:47:00.128 --> 03:47:00.609]  Exactly.
[03:47:00.769 --> 03:47:06.535]  The internal battle, and that's why he goes out and he talks to people on the speakers fair, that internal battle that he has, we all have.
[03:47:06.895 --> 03:47:08.515]  On multiple issues all the time.
[03:47:08.775 --> 03:47:10.956]  And it's going to get much worse, Alex, as we go on.
[03:47:10.976 --> 03:47:11.776]  That's a key issue.
[03:47:11.996 --> 03:47:14.837]  And that's why talking to him about that will be very, very important.
[03:47:14.877 --> 03:47:17.678]  Because not all of us are going to be in a combat situation.
[03:47:17.718 --> 03:47:20.158]  I'm never, well, I don't know what's going to happen in the United States.
[03:47:20.418 --> 03:47:21.859]  We're going to go watch Amerigeddon tonight.
[03:47:21.919 --> 03:47:23.279]  I don't know what's going to happen in the future.
[03:47:23.319 --> 03:47:26.720]  But look, most of us are not going to be in a combat situation.
[03:47:26.740 --> 03:47:27.300]  Oh, that's right.
[03:47:27.380 --> 03:47:28.240]  I should have plugged that.
[03:47:28.260 --> 03:47:29.641]  Here I am saying I'm leaving and I won't shut up.
[03:47:30.541 --> 03:47:33.121]  Because there's a big Dallas showing, a bunch of other showings.
[03:47:33.401 --> 03:47:35.662]  Tell us where you're going to be to watch Amerigeddon tonight, David.
[03:47:36.062 --> 03:47:38.443]  I'm going to be at the Theatre of the Regal in Austin.
[03:47:38.463 --> 03:47:40.504]  I'm going to be there at the 7 o'clock show.
[03:47:40.524 --> 03:47:41.224]  We're going to watch that.
[03:47:41.644 --> 03:47:43.025]  And I think you're going to introduce it, aren't you?
[03:47:43.165 --> 03:47:45.146]  No, we're going to shoot a report.
[03:47:45.186 --> 03:47:47.406]  We're going to do a review afterwards.
[03:47:47.446 --> 03:47:48.567]  We'll probably talk to some people.
[03:47:48.607 --> 03:47:50.988]  And we're sending a crew up to the red carpet deal in Dallas.
[03:47:51.428 --> 03:47:52.488]  That's right.
[03:47:52.508 --> 03:47:52.588]  Yeah.
[03:47:52.608 --> 03:47:52.708]  Yeah.
[03:47:52.748 --> 03:47:53.689]  Lee Ann Mackett is going up there.
[03:47:53.729 --> 03:47:55.169]  So I'm going to turn it over to you.
[03:47:55.209 --> 03:47:55.449]  Go ahead.
[03:47:55.830 --> 03:47:56.230]  Okay.
[03:47:56.530 --> 03:47:56.790]  All right.
[03:47:57.050 --> 03:48:01.672]  Well, as I mentioned before, we're talking about what Obama has taken upon himself today.
[03:48:01.692 --> 03:48:04.093]  And I think this is time for people to wake up.
[03:48:04.773 --> 03:48:08.876]  You know, the old analogy of the boiling frogs in the water, you know, you gradually turn up the heat.
[03:48:08.916 --> 03:48:11.337]  At some point, they realize that they're being cooked.
[03:48:12.178 --> 03:48:17.041]  What is it going to take for Americans to realize that they are being cooked?
[03:48:17.621 --> 03:48:23.145]  That they are sacrificing and social engineering our families, our children.
[03:48:23.865 --> 03:48:28.288]  Now, with what we're seeing here with these bathrooms, this is just one aspect of it.
[03:48:28.468 --> 03:48:30.729]  And of course, it's a constitutional issue as well.
[03:48:31.050 --> 03:48:32.791]  Are you going to realize that you're being cooked
[03:48:33.271 --> 03:48:36.932]  By this government that constantly takes on these different issues.
[03:48:37.272 --> 03:48:40.433]  And I see people have been holding on here, so I don't want to go too long on this.
[03:48:40.533 --> 03:48:42.653]  I do want to get to... Aaron, hang on there.
[03:48:42.673 --> 03:48:44.033]  I'm going to try to get to some of the other callers.
[03:48:44.093 --> 03:48:45.694]  I see you've been hanging on for a very long time.
[03:48:46.034 --> 03:48:48.994]  But just real quickly, I want to mention what's going on with this.
[03:48:49.034 --> 03:48:53.035]  Now, today, in case you haven't seen yet, there's a lot of news about this today.
[03:48:53.455 --> 03:49:01.617]  Today on Friday, Obama directed schools across the nation to provide transgender students with access to student with suitable facilities.
[03:49:02.077 --> 03:49:05.220]  Now, we've had the lawsuit go back and forth between North Carolina.
[03:49:05.260 --> 03:49:06.782]  We said, this is an important principle.
[03:49:07.222 --> 03:49:20.115]  North Carolina should have stood up and said, you are not going to dictate in Charlotte, because this is something that was started by one transgender outfit that was headed by a convicted child molester.
[03:49:21.445 --> 03:49:23.247]  They started this situation in Charlotte.
[03:49:23.607 --> 03:49:28.071]  The government of North Carolina should have said, hey, you're not going to dictate that to people.
[03:49:28.091 --> 03:49:30.733]  You're not going to dictate it to schools, to businesses, to other places.
[03:49:31.214 --> 03:49:39.181]  Instead, what they did was they came back, they escalated it, then you've now got the federal government and the state government of North Carolina suing each other.
[03:49:39.201 --> 03:49:45.186]  But this is clearly a situation where the federal government has no legal authority at all.
[03:49:45.226 --> 03:49:46.868]  Now, the Texas lieutenant governor
[03:49:47.408 --> 03:49:47.949]  I don't know.
[03:50:07.785 --> 03:50:12.894]  That Texas public schools get about $10 billion worth of federal funds over each two-year budget.
[03:50:13.114 --> 03:50:16.680]  He said the majority of that is for the breakfast and the school lunch programs.
[03:50:16.740 --> 03:50:19.645]  And as Alex and Joe Biggs were talking about,
[03:50:20.526 --> 03:50:25.268]  We look at these pictures, this garbage food that Michelle has taken it upon herself to dictate.
[03:50:25.868 --> 03:50:29.470]  Isn't that a perfect metaphor for what our educational system has become?
[03:50:29.870 --> 03:50:36.913]  The junk that our educational system has turned into with Common Core, with the Department of Education manipulating everything?
[03:50:37.173 --> 03:50:47.558]  He says, so Barack Obama, if schools don't knuckle down to force girls showering with boys, to force eight-year-old girls to have to endure boys coming into their bathroom, then he's going to take money from the poorest of the poor.
[03:50:48.018 --> 03:50:49.399]  He says we're not going to sell this out.
[03:50:49.619 --> 03:50:52.941]  The President's going to find that Democrat families will push back against this.
[03:50:53.241 --> 03:50:56.223]  Republican families, black families, white families, brown families.
[03:50:56.443 --> 03:50:59.926]  This has nothing to do with being against transgender or gay.
[03:51:00.286 --> 03:51:04.849]  It has everything to do with keeping the... Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[03:51:04.929 --> 03:51:06.570]  This is a Hillary Clinton ad from 2008.
[03:51:08.385 --> 03:51:09.166]  It's 3 a.m.
[03:51:09.266 --> 03:51:10.948]  and your children are safe and asleep.
[03:51:11.669 --> 03:51:14.853]  But there's a phone in the White House and it's ringing.
[03:51:14.913 --> 03:51:16.275]  Something's happening in the world.
[03:51:16.295 --> 03:51:17.837]  Hello, Secretary Clinton.
[03:51:17.997 --> 03:51:19.539]  This is Ambassador Stevens.
[03:51:19.579 --> 03:51:21.822]  We are under attack here in Benghazi.
[03:51:22.102 --> 03:51:22.483]  Hello?
[03:51:22.883 --> 03:51:26.087]  H, your vote will decide who answers that call.
[03:51:26.147 --> 03:51:27.008]  Bob, what time is it?
[03:51:27.709 --> 03:51:28.630]  Whoa, it's 3am?
[03:51:29.010 --> 03:51:35.393]  Whether it's someone who already knows the world's leaders, knows the military, someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous war.
[03:51:35.513 --> 03:51:37.974]  Oh cool, she should answer, she said she would.
[03:51:38.034 --> 03:51:38.995]  Hello, we're under attack!
[03:51:39.515 --> 03:51:40.695]  The building's on fire!
[03:51:41.216 --> 03:51:42.196]  They're shooting at us!
[03:51:42.516 --> 03:51:43.917]  There's explosions!
[03:51:44.317 --> 03:51:45.298]  Where the f*** are you?
[03:51:45.318 --> 03:51:47.258]  You said you were gonna answer!
[03:51:47.298 --> 03:51:48.859]  Come on, Secretary Clinton!
[03:51:49.059 --> 03:51:49.940]  We need you!
[03:51:50.240 --> 03:51:51.380]  Don't leave us!
[03:51:51.460 --> 03:51:54.202]  It's 3am, and your children are safe and asleep.
[03:51:54.222 --> 03:51:56.523]  Who do you want answering the phone?
[03:51:56.863 --> 03:51:59.206]  What difference at this point does it make?
[03:51:59.346 --> 03:52:01.368]  I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
[03:52:15.362 --> 03:52:18.924]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[03:52:18.944 --> 03:52:21.286]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:52:21.666 --> 03:52:25.169]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:52:25.209 --> 03:52:28.371]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:52:28.851 --> 03:52:33.654]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:52:34.195 --> 03:52:36.036]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[03:52:36.376 --> 03:52:40.819]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:52:40.959 --> 03:52:42.981]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:52:43.601 --> 03:52:45.062]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:52:45.202 --> 03:52:45.462]  Exactly.
[03:52:45.482 --> 03:52:49.266]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:52:49.767 --> 03:52:57.775]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:53:02.578 --> 03:53:03.979]  My name is Alex Jones.
[03:53:04.499 --> 03:53:10.423]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:53:10.643 --> 03:53:24.813]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running 6 miles every other day, swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights
[03:53:25.413 --> 03:53:27.335]  We're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[03:53:27.735 --> 03:53:35.541]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[03:53:35.761 --> 03:53:42.886]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[03:53:43.187 --> 03:53:48.911]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[03:53:49.051 --> 03:53:55.216]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[03:53:55.436 --> 03:53:59.337]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[03:53:59.357 --> 03:54:04.077]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[03:54:04.358 --> 03:54:10.399]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[03:54:10.659 --> 03:54:13.739]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[03:56:59.946 --> 03:57:02.087]  Yes, Debra in Rhode Island, go ahead.
[03:57:04.927 --> 03:57:05.247]  Hello?
[03:57:05.527 --> 03:57:06.128]  Hey, Debra.
[03:57:06.508 --> 03:57:07.468]  Thank you for holding, go ahead.
[03:57:07.488 --> 03:57:08.028]  Hey, David.
[03:57:08.328 --> 03:57:08.848]  How are you?
[03:57:08.928 --> 03:57:10.409]  Long time listener, 12 years.
[03:57:10.709 --> 03:57:11.249]  Oh, thank you.
[03:57:11.589 --> 03:57:12.469]  Thank you for supporting us.
[03:57:12.509 --> 03:57:12.869]  Oh, yeah.
[03:57:13.149 --> 03:57:18.631]  And then passing, promoting, posting, and it's woken up a lot of people.
[03:57:18.831 --> 03:57:20.131]  Well, it's a cooperative effort.
[03:57:20.151 --> 03:57:20.791]  Thank you so much.
[03:57:20.871 --> 03:57:22.432]  We've got very little time, so go ahead.
[03:57:22.452 --> 03:57:28.173]  I don't know where to start, but I just don't understand why Hillary Clinton
[03:57:28.951 --> 03:57:35.093]  is still able to be running for office, never mind the president.
[03:57:35.313 --> 03:57:36.073]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:57:36.113 --> 03:57:37.134]  Why isn't she locked up?
[03:57:37.354 --> 03:57:37.714]  Absolutely.
[03:57:37.734 --> 03:57:49.597]  When you listen to Chris Tonto-Piranto talking to the guy who was at Benghazi, you know, it is amazing that nothing, nothing that she does ever gets them in trouble.
[03:57:49.837 --> 03:57:50.878]  They sail above everything.
[03:57:50.918 --> 03:57:51.538]  Isn't that incredible?
[03:57:52.774 --> 03:57:53.555]  Let me tell you something.
[03:57:53.575 --> 03:57:56.216]  I've been a long time supporter of the military.
[03:57:56.236 --> 03:58:02.740]  I hold the power of attorney for a homeless veteran that was a sniper for six years, in the military for almost 20 years.
[03:58:03.340 --> 03:58:05.101]  Okay, he lives in North Carolina.
[03:58:05.862 --> 03:58:21.611]  And I didn't hear this from him, but I did hear this from somebody that knows that there was some really bad blood between Stephen and Hillary Clinton.
[03:58:22.250 --> 03:58:22.831]  Yeah.
[03:58:23.191 --> 03:58:23.932]  We're at the end.
[03:58:24.072 --> 03:58:25.633]  Oh yeah, we've had a lot to talk about.
[03:58:25.953 --> 03:58:27.134]  I'm sorry we're out of time.
[03:58:27.174 --> 03:58:28.336]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:58:28.776 --> 03:58:31.258]  Join us tonight at 7 Central, 8 PM Eastern.
[03:58:31.398 --> 03:58:35.702]  Don't forget to go to the American Geddon Premiere if it's in your area, and we'll be back on Sunday.
[03:58:42.769 --> 03:58:44.090]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:44.330 --> 03:58:47.373]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:52.219 --> 03:58:52.880]  Uh, yeah.
[03:58:52.920 --> 03:58:58.705]  First of all, I want to say, X-12, X-2, Supermail, Brain Force, Prostagart, Silver Bullet.
[03:58:58.765 --> 03:58:59.666]  I use them all.
[03:58:59.706 --> 03:59:00.647]  They're phenomenal.
[03:59:00.707 --> 03:59:01.208]  They work.
[03:59:01.448 --> 03:59:02.209]  Buy them, folks.
[03:59:02.289 --> 03:59:02.829]  Thank you, brother.
[03:59:02.909 --> 03:59:03.490]  Thank you, guys.
