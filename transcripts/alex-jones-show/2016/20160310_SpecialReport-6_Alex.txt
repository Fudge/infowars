[00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:09.478]  Leanne McAdoo for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:09.538 --> 00:00:10.839]  I'm here in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.301]  Now we are four days into the official passing of Open Carry.
[00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:21.485]  Wanted to see what people's opinion are of now they're going to be actually able to view people's guns in their holster.
[00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:22.525]  Are they afraid of that?
[00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:23.466]  Are they okay with that?
[00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:26.387]  And we also wanted to get people's take on what's happening in Oregon.
[00:00:26.407 --> 00:00:31.650]  Do they think this is a good move or is this going to bolster Obama's push for gun control?
[00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.012]  Well, we just passed Open Carry here January 1st.
[00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:35.613]  Oh, great.
[00:00:35.673 --> 00:00:36.373]  I'm all for it.
[00:00:36.573 --> 00:00:36.813]  Yeah.
[00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:37.935]  I'm all against it.
[00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:39.117]  Really?
[00:00:39.157 --> 00:00:39.517]  Yes.
[00:00:39.718 --> 00:00:40.679]  And we're still married.
[00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:47.849]  I am for gun regulations and open carry is weird.
[00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.636]  I'm not going to go to any business where I see people waltzing in there with their guns.
[00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:53.276]  It's just
[00:00:55.052 --> 00:00:55.972]  It just turns me off.
[00:00:56.273 --> 00:00:59.755]  What do you guys think about the open carry that just passed here in Austin?
[00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:00.896]  We're not from here.
[00:01:01.317 --> 00:01:01.497]  Sorry.
[00:01:01.777 --> 00:01:07.062]  Does that frighten you to think that people will have guns on their holster or are you okay with it?
[00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:08.843]  I'm okay with it.
[00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:12.506]  As long as they're responsible, I'm fine with it.
[00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:15.649]  Would you be frightened to see people with their guns on their holster?
[00:01:17.783 --> 00:01:19.345]  I don't think so, because it is Texas.
[00:01:19.365 --> 00:01:24.429]  Probably in some places I would, and probably in some places I wouldn't.
[00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.390]  It just depends on the setting?
[00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:27.712]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:28.752 --> 00:01:31.215]  I think if you're responsible, it can be done well.
[00:01:31.435 --> 00:01:35.718]  But if you're not, and people aren't paying attention, bad things happen.
[00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.539]  I'm a fan.
[00:01:38.741 --> 00:01:39.602]  What's your opinion on it?
[00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:52.724]  Well, I don't think everyone should just be walking around with them, but mainly when it's really hot and you want to carry and it's too hard to wear eight pounds of clothes when it's 100 degrees out, then it's nice to be able to.
[00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:55.285]  Well, I'm all for Second Amendment.
[00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:58.047]  I think people should have the right to do what they wish to do.
[00:01:59.188 --> 00:02:05.512]  However, like my wife said, I think that it's better to have it concealed than to be shown.
[00:02:06.652 --> 00:02:09.174]  But if somebody wants to have it shown, that's up to them.
[00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:10.815]  But if you're allowed to have a gun,
[00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.681]  It's kind of odd to not be allowed to carry it.
[00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:15.702]  That's how I feel about it.
[00:02:15.722 --> 00:02:18.024]  It lets you know who has the weapon.
[00:02:18.584 --> 00:02:20.686]  There's people walking around with them concealed anyways.
[00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:21.607]  I think that's scarier.
[00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:26.911]  Would you continue to go to a business that allowed people to bring in their guns?
[00:02:28.612 --> 00:02:31.654]  Yeah, I think, I mean, I think I would.
[00:02:31.674 --> 00:02:34.056]  I wouldn't like boycott them.
[00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:37.899]  If I was in a circumstance where I felt uncomfortable or something, I might leave, but
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.841]  I wouldn't make a big point out of it.
[00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:41.862]  She said she wants more regulations.
[00:02:42.022 --> 00:02:50.929]  Well, people that are law-abiding citizens are now having more regulations placed upon them, and criminals will, in fact, skirt the law anyway.
[00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.390]  So to me, it's ridiculous.
[00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.631]  Are you aware of what's going on in Oregon right now?
[00:02:55.152 --> 00:02:55.432]  Yeah.
[00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:59.515]  I'm aware, but I haven't, like, read a lot of details about it.
[00:02:59.755 --> 00:03:04.778]  The President is about to come out on Thursday calling for more gun control regulations.
[00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:11.282]  Do you think something like that is going to cause the country to be in support of more gun control?
[00:03:11.563 --> 00:03:15.505]  Or do you think that they're going to be proud of Americans standing up?
[00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:21.789]  I think whoever is already against and for gun control is just going to sway them more either way.
[00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.371]  I don't think it's going to change anyone's mind.
[00:03:24.656 --> 00:03:26.358]  I don't think it's going to be bringing people together.
[00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:29.481]  People are going to interpret it how they see it.
[00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:39.152]  They're going to either be on the side that thinks, oh man, this is what needs to be done, give an inch and take a mile, and the other side is, oh, this is so typical.
[00:03:39.172 --> 00:03:42.716]  There's a lot of people that feel like the federal government overreaches what
[00:03:43.536 --> 00:03:44.396]  What it's there for.
[00:03:45.297 --> 00:03:47.138]  That's what they feel like up there, obviously.
[00:03:47.158 --> 00:03:49.839]  In a lot of cases, that's what I feel like.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.623]  I haven't had a situation where I felt compelled to gather some fellow citizens and take over a building.
[00:03:59.783 --> 00:04:10.128]  I'm also not a rancher that lost their livelihood because the federal government decided they were going to take some land or stop letting someone use my land or stop letting me use land.
[00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:25.998]  So I mean I definitely I get where they're coming from but I'm gonna have to read about it more for sure to decide whether I think they're going totally overboard or maybe they're just having the guts to do something that somebody's got to do.
[00:04:26.018 --> 00:04:32.442]  I think things should be done legally all right and do I actually think that's gonna hinder it?
[00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:36.218]  No, I think Obama's going to do what Obama wants to do.
[00:04:36.238 --> 00:04:43.721]  He's in his lame duck term as president and he's just going to try to flex whatever muscle he thinks he can do and try to get away with it.
[00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:45.562]  He's going to do the right thing.
[00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:12.062]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:05:12.282 --> 00:05:18.407]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:05:18.608 --> 00:05:25.554]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:05:25.914 --> 00:05:35.838]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:05:36.418 --> 00:05:42.321]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:45.262]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:47.163]  Adenosylcobalamin.
[00:05:47.403 --> 00:05:50.745]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, lied on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:52.626]  No needles, no injections.
[00:05:52.887 --> 00:05:54.367]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:05:54.548 --> 00:05:55.568]  Try it for yourself.
[00:05:55.748 --> 00:05:56.749]  Discover the secret.
