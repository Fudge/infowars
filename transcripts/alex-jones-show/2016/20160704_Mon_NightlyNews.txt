[00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:21.843]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.983 --> 00:00:24.284]  It's July 4th, 2016.
[00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:25.044]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:26.585]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:36.950]  We celebrate the 4th of July as a reminder of earning our independence from a tyrannical and oppressive government.
[00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.693]  Just a reminder to the Obama administration, there's plenty of room on the calendar for another holiday.
[00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:54.663]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:56.384]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:00:56.824 --> 00:00:57.084]  Okay?
[00:00:57.384 --> 00:01:00.245]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:02.146]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.466]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:01:03.806 --> 00:01:04.506]  This is Texas.
[00:01:04.746 --> 00:01:05.547]  You want to threaten me?
[00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:06.727]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:07.407]  You understand that?
[00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:13.289]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:17.590]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.432]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com with an extremely important message.
[00:01:55.933 --> 00:02:00.916]  You're probably asking yourself right now, what's the most important phrase in America right now?
[00:02:01.456 --> 00:02:03.658]  Well, it happens to be Hillary for prison.
[00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:07.420]  Get your Hillary for prison t-shirt today at the InfoWars store for $9.95.
[00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:10.482]  That's half of what it used to be at $19.95.
[00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:12.904]  Why do you want to get this?
[00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:15.485]  Why should you buy this for you and your friends and family?
[00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:18.968]  Because number one, it's a great conversation starter, and number two,
[00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:24.212]  Hell, you get to trigger a whole lot of crazy liberal commie bastards, and that's what I like to do.
[00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:31.778]  And maybe you're just at work right now, and it's casual shirt Friday, and one of your hipster buddies walks in with a Hillary Clinton shirt saying, I'm with her.
[00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:32.599]  Negative!
[00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:33.360]  This is what you're gonna do.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:42.367]  You're gonna stand up and go, UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:50.447]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get your Hillary for Prison shirt today for $9.95 and trigger more assholes like him.
[00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.270]  Come on, Hillary.
[00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:54.051]  Just a little.
[00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:55.132]  Just a little sip.
[00:02:55.693 --> 00:02:55.993]  Open up.
[00:02:56.314 --> 00:02:57.215]  Come on, take it!
[00:02:57.695 --> 00:02:58.076]  Take it!
[00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.172]  Today is the day that Americans celebrate our Declaration of Independence from Great Britain.
[00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:08.333]  And of course, it's not just a day.
[00:03:08.393 --> 00:03:11.115]  This is something that continues every day.
[00:03:11.715 --> 00:03:16.018]  It was when we laid out the basis of government from our American perspective.
[00:03:16.058 --> 00:03:20.741]  That is, that government is there to protect our liberties, our God-given rights.
[00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:27.445]  And when a government destroys those liberties, it is our right, it is our duty to alter or abolish that government.
[00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:30.787]  That's essentially what happened in Great Britain, interestingly enough, about ten days ago.
[00:03:31.434 --> 00:03:38.276]  They declared their independence from a European super state that is metastasizing like the cancer it is.
[00:03:38.956 --> 00:03:40.897]  Now, we're going to have another opportunity in America.
[00:03:40.937 --> 00:03:44.298]  As I point out, this is not something that was 200 and some odd years in the past.
[00:03:44.678 --> 00:03:48.639]  This is an ongoing struggle to keep our freedom.
[00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:55.443]  We're going to have an election in America, and the issue before us is the same one that was put before the British people.
[00:03:55.864 --> 00:04:06.791]  And that is, are we going to be ruled by a globalist cabal of politicians and multinational corporations that write our rules for us, that write our laws for us, that we have absolutely no control over?
[00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:11.234]  That's what is coming up with the Trans-Pacific, the Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[00:04:11.414 --> 00:04:13.495]  We've already seen glimpses of that with NAFTA.
[00:04:13.535 --> 00:04:18.419]  We understand that it is sold to us as an economic opportunity.
[00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:24.441]  But it is really opportunism by the globalists who use it for political consolidation.
[00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:25.541]  The game is up.
[00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:27.002]  We understand what you're doing.
[00:04:27.622 --> 00:04:28.762]  And the British understand that.
[00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:30.162]  We understand that in America.
[00:04:30.483 --> 00:04:32.243]  We have a very clear choice before us.
[00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:44.227]  We're going to either vote for Hillary Clinton and the globalist elite, the political elite of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, who support the globalism that we've had from both of them, or we can vote for Trump.
[00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:48.750]  He has opposed this consistently for over 30 years.
[00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.851]  But I first want to take a look at how this all came about.
[00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:56.232]  You know, we've got a lot of people going back doing a post-mortem on this saying, what happened?
[00:04:56.492 --> 00:04:57.073]  What's the matter?
[00:04:57.113 --> 00:05:00.074]  The Europeans, especially the Germans, are very angry at the Tory party.
[00:05:00.114 --> 00:05:03.855]  Why did they allow this referendum on whether they were going to have independence?
[00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:07.876]  Interestingly enough, it wasn't really their idea.
[00:05:09.013 --> 00:05:16.318]  Yes, they proposed it because they saw Nigel Farage and UKIP coming up in the rearview mirror.
[00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:17.740]  But where did it happen?
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.460]  When did it happen?
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.585]  Well, we learned that it happened back in May of 2012, about four years before they had the election.
[00:05:25.265 --> 00:05:35.910]  It was after an economic summit in Chicago, and then Prime Minister David Cameron and some of his staff that were with him were eating in a pizzeria in the Chicago airport.
[00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.891]  And the British press was absolutely amazed.
[00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:38.692]  They said, look at this.
[00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:48.757]  They've had all this heavy security, you know, like we see at Bilderberg and the G7 groups, and they had this heavy security around these people, and yet here they are, just eating in an ordinary pizzeria.
[00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:51.358]  We think it was a Pizzeria Uno from everybody's best guess.
[00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:53.686]  Here they are just having pizza.
[00:05:53.706 --> 00:05:55.387]  So it was widely reported at the time.
[00:05:55.727 --> 00:06:05.370]  And then later they learned that this is where they decided to hold the Brexit referendum in order to keep UKIP from coming at them and overtaking them, as I point out in the rear view mirror.
[00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.650]  And I can imagine perhaps how this happened.
[00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:12.452]  You know, they're here at the pizzeria place and maybe somebody came up to them and said, do you want it to go?
[00:06:13.781 --> 00:06:14.382]  Yes, that's it.
[00:06:14.402 --> 00:06:15.163]  We'll do takeout.
[00:06:15.744 --> 00:06:18.427]  And from that idea, they had Brexit.
[00:06:18.988 --> 00:06:21.791]  Now, it was interesting, and I think we need to focus.
[00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:29.180]  We're going to talk about the lies from David Cameron as he's represented Brexit, and how we've now seen this European super state
[00:06:29.941 --> 00:06:36.887]  In the week after they had the vote, all the things that he was saying were not true, we're now seeing those things come out as being revealed as true.
[00:06:37.307 --> 00:06:41.130]  But first, I want to take a look at the man who really made this happen.
[00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.833]  He took a victory lap at the European Parliament, and this is what he had to say.
[00:06:45.874 --> 00:06:57.103]  You know, when I came here 17 years ago, and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me.
[00:06:58.373 --> 00:07:00.916]  Well I have to say, you're not laughing now, are you?
[00:07:01.877 --> 00:07:10.908]  And the reason you're so upset, the reason you're so angry, has been perfectly clear from all the angry exchanges this morning.
[00:07:11.408 --> 00:07:14.812]  You, as a political project, are in denial.
[00:07:15.575 --> 00:07:19.819]  Now as Farage pointed out, they always offer it as an economic opportunity.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.282]  But what they do is they create an economic crisis.
[00:07:22.302 --> 00:07:24.043]  We've seen this game over and over again.
[00:07:24.123 --> 00:07:25.665]  Crisis, solution.
[00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:28.367]  And the solution is more political union.
[00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:31.150]  And as he pointed out, they even have the Lisbon Treaty.
[00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:37.817]  He said they brought that sovereignty in the back door even when Netherlands and France said we don't want any part of it.
[00:07:38.397 --> 00:07:50.187]  Now, as we had the lead up to the Brexit vote, I think it's very interesting to analyze what was said by David Cameron just before the vote and what was revealed just after the vote.
[00:07:50.247 --> 00:07:53.890]  Here's David Cameron talking about the lies of UKIP.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:02.683]  People are getting through the letterboxes, leaflets from Leave, saying, basically, Turkey's going to join the EU.
[00:08:03.003 --> 00:08:03.523]  Not true.
[00:08:03.743 --> 00:08:05.644]  There's going to be a European army with Britain in it.
[00:08:05.964 --> 00:08:06.424]  Not true.
[00:08:06.664 --> 00:08:09.025]  And we give £350 million a week to Brussels.
[00:08:09.305 --> 00:08:09.725]  Not true.
[00:08:10.005 --> 00:08:17.408]  Now look, if we want to vote to leave this organisation, let's vote to leave it, but let's not do it on the basis of three things that are completely untrue.
[00:08:17.448 --> 00:08:24.791]  Alright, well let's just... Okay, we now see, just a week later, that those lies, and the key one I want to focus on is the European army.
[00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:27.431]  We see now that that was true.
[00:08:27.692 --> 00:08:28.372]  It was not a lie.
[00:08:28.412 --> 00:08:34.119]  He said, if you're going to get out, get out for other reasons, but these reasons that are being given are just simply not true.
[00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:38.183]  Well, we saw this narrative being put out by Politico, by The Guardian.
[00:08:38.223 --> 00:08:43.089]  The Guardian put out about a month before said, is there a secret plan to create a European army?
[00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:44.791]  It's like, no, no, not actually.
[00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:49.418]  Politico said we're going to wage war on the myth of a European army.
[00:08:49.498 --> 00:08:56.949]  They say Brexiteers are tapping into deep-rooted tropes of Euroscepticism guaranteed to alarm the British public.
[00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.795]  And of course one of those tropes was that there was going to be a European super state.
[00:09:01.075 --> 00:09:03.696]  With an army, which we now see is true.
[00:09:04.496 --> 00:09:16.738]  They say, well, going back to March 2015, this is Politico articles, European Commission President Juncker advocated a common European army as a way to increase the EU's standing on the world stage, not least in the eyes of Russia.
[00:09:16.778 --> 00:09:21.759]  So even they admitted at that point, well, yes, they've made a lot of statements about this.
[00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:25.340]  And of course, they've been widely reported in multiple areas what they wanted to do.
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:35.813]  But they said, just as David Cameron said about Turkey, and we didn't have the clip there, but he goes on to say in that meeting where he was being questioned by the public, he said, oh, Turkey?
[00:09:35.834 --> 00:09:38.857]  Yeah, yeah, I would love to have Turkey in, but it ain't going to happen for another 30 years.
[00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:40.150]  Okay.
[00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.550]  But it would happen.
[00:09:42.251 --> 00:09:43.651]  And this is going to happen.
[00:09:43.691 --> 00:09:45.231]  They've already laid out the plans for this.
[00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:52.473]  Now, going back to what the Guardian said about a month before the Brexit vote, they said EU army plans kept secret from voters.
[00:09:52.513 --> 00:09:54.814]  They said that was a front page story on Friday's Times.
[00:09:54.894 --> 00:10:09.257]  And if the claim sounded familiar, that was because just two days earlier, a retired British army commander had claimed in the Daily Express that the EU was moving inexorably towards full political union and all that comes with it, including a unified armed forces.
[00:10:09.557 --> 00:10:13.499]  And then they go on to say, is there a serious, imminent chance of this happening?
[00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:16.500]  Oh no, said the Guardian, okay?
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.322]  They said, EU defence policy remains in the hands of European governments, not the EU executive.
[00:10:21.683 --> 00:10:25.404]  Contrary to reports, it will not propose an EU army.
[00:10:26.004 --> 00:10:26.485]  Okay, now.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.061]  That was a month before Brexit.
[00:10:29.942 --> 00:10:44.012]  Less than a week after Brexit, we had a Polish television network release a detailed document that was put together by France and by Germany, by the foreign ministers of both of those countries.
[00:10:45.054 --> 00:10:47.494]  Now, this document was not written over the weekend.
[00:10:47.554 --> 00:10:49.615]  It was released on the Monday following the Brexit vote.
[00:10:49.635 --> 00:10:51.775]  This was something that had been developed for quite some time.
[00:10:51.995 --> 00:11:00.797]  They don't produce documents like this in these massive bureaucracies as a joint statement between two foreign ministers of two countries without a lot of advanced preparation.
[00:11:00.817 --> 00:11:07.098]  So at the time all this was being downplayed in the press, they were well into this document.
[00:11:07.138 --> 00:11:10.119]  I want to look at this document with you and ask you,
[00:11:10.979 --> 00:11:18.392]  To honestly think about this, are they talking about creating a European army under an executive power?
[00:11:18.552 --> 00:11:20.595]  And we will see very clearly that they are.
[00:11:21.096 --> 00:11:22.158]  Now, here's some excerpts from that.
[00:11:22.178 --> 00:11:24.402]  They say, our two countries, that's France and Germany,
[00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:26.238]  Share a common destiny.
[00:11:26.318 --> 00:11:30.121]  We will therefore move further towards political union.
[00:11:30.442 --> 00:11:31.783]  Political union in Europe.
[00:11:32.263 --> 00:11:34.585]  We will invite other Europeans to join us in the endeavor.
[00:11:34.685 --> 00:11:36.927]  Well, you see, it's not about political union, they say.
[00:11:37.387 --> 00:11:43.692]  They go on to say, France and Germany will therefore promote a more coherent and more assertive Europe on the world stage.
[00:11:43.712 --> 00:11:45.033]  They're going to project power, folks.
[00:11:45.782 --> 00:11:51.824]  They say the main challenges ensure the security of our citizens confronted with growing external and internal threats.
[00:11:52.365 --> 00:12:03.449]  We want to establish a stable cooperative framework for dealing with migration and refugee flows, boost the European economy, so forth and so on, and move towards the completion of economic and monetary union.
[00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:06.671]  So now, this is all still about political union.
[00:12:06.831 --> 00:12:09.573]  A closer, tighter European super state.
[00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:10.634]  Now we go to the next section.
[00:12:10.974 --> 00:12:12.796]  A European security compact.
[00:12:12.856 --> 00:12:14.117]  This is where the army comes in.
[00:12:14.457 --> 00:12:16.759]  They say conflict is being imported into our continent.
[00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:17.419]  By who?
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.301]  By the European Union!
[00:12:19.981 --> 00:12:25.148]  The terrorist threat is growing, feeding on complex networks inside and outside Europe and stemming from crisis zones.
[00:12:25.468 --> 00:12:31.536]  Providing security for Europe, as well as contributing to peace and stability globally, is at the heart of the European project.
[00:12:31.576 --> 00:12:35.661]  And of course, the European project is just a step towards a global world government.
[00:12:36.513 --> 00:12:44.584]  We see the EU, they go on to say, as a key power in its neighborhood, but also as an actor for peace and stability with global reach, tackling global challenges.
[00:12:44.984 --> 00:12:50.171]  A rules-based international order, underpinned by strategic stability.
[00:12:50.552 --> 00:12:51.012]  Think about that.
[00:12:51.493 --> 00:12:52.874]  This is all about globalism, folks.
[00:12:52.894 --> 00:12:54.914]  This is not even about a European super-state.
[00:12:55.155 --> 00:12:57.055]  This is about a world super-state.
[00:12:57.395 --> 00:12:59.456]  They are a building block toward that.
[00:12:59.876 --> 00:13:03.318]  This is why they hate to see it unraveling as it appears that it may.
[00:13:03.338 --> 00:13:08.440]  They're talking about global challenges and they're talking about a rules-based international order.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.480]  Who's going to write those rules?
[00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:15.023]  The same people that write our secret treaties that our elected representatives are not even allowed to read, okay?
[00:13:15.623 --> 00:13:25.029]  Now, they say to respond to this challenge, Germany and France propose a European security compact which encompasses all aspects of security and defense dealt with at the European level.
[00:13:25.689 --> 00:13:36.036]  They go on to say, France and Germany will promote the EU as an independent and global actor able to leverage its unique array of expertise, tools, civilian and military.
[00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:41.119]  Now, they go on, the EU should be able to plan and conduct civil and military operations.
[00:13:41.917 --> 00:13:47.222]  More effectively, with the support of a permanent civilian military chain of command.
[00:13:47.242 --> 00:13:47.923]  Do you understand that?
[00:13:48.503 --> 00:13:51.066]  A permanent civilian military chain of command.
[00:13:51.266 --> 00:13:56.952]  The EU should be able to rely on employable high readiness forces, provide common financing for its operation.
[00:13:56.972 --> 00:13:57.712]  How are they going to do that?
[00:13:57.933 --> 00:14:00.915]  They will have European Union super state taxes.
[00:14:01.556 --> 00:14:06.862]  Within the framework of the EU, member states will establish permanent, structured cooperation in the field of defense.
[00:14:07.483 --> 00:14:12.009]  EU member states should consider establishing a standing maritime force.
[00:14:12.689 --> 00:14:13.290]  Understand this.
[00:14:14.151 --> 00:14:16.714]  They're talking about a permanent standing army.
[00:14:17.734 --> 00:14:19.775]  Talking about a permanent standing Navy.
[00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:23.337]  They'll be able to project military force, okay?
[00:14:23.717 --> 00:14:28.540]  And they are also talking about an executive who is going to control that.
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.663]  Then they tackle their other objective, and that is their migration policy.
[00:14:32.683 --> 00:14:37.345]  They say there shall be no unilateral national answers to the migration challenge.
[00:14:37.365 --> 00:14:38.106]  In other words, folks,
[00:14:38.846 --> 00:14:41.568]  The individual nation states are not going to have a say.
[00:14:42.009 --> 00:14:45.872]  This is all going to be done by the centralized European government.
[00:14:45.912 --> 00:14:48.675]  They also talk about completing economic and monetary union.
[00:14:49.395 --> 00:14:52.558]  Now understand they're going to have a full-time European president.
[00:14:52.578 --> 00:14:57.142]  They say they're going to harmonize regulation and oversight as well as corporate taxation.
[00:14:57.502 --> 00:15:03.167]  All the taxes, all the regulation is going to come from there including common social minimum standards.
[00:15:03.247 --> 00:15:05.409]  It is a complete European state.
[00:15:05.769 --> 00:15:06.350]  Now they have
[00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:12.475]  Try to do everything they can to mess with the markets, to scare people about this, to try to get them to back down.
[00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:18.561]  But you need to understand and look at the way Nigel Farage addressed the European Parliament.
[00:15:18.661 --> 00:15:25.427]  He made it very clear that it was in the interest of everyone to move forward and just to have a real economic union, which is the way this started.
[00:15:25.707 --> 00:15:26.528]  Here's what he had to say.
[00:15:27.318 --> 00:15:33.244]  Between your countries and my country, we do an enormous amount of business in goods and services.
[00:15:33.684 --> 00:15:37.027]  That trade is mutually beneficial to both of us.
[00:15:37.327 --> 00:15:38.669]  That trade matters.
[00:15:39.349 --> 00:15:52.982]  If you were to decide to cut off your noses, to spite your faces, and to reject any idea of a sensible trade deal, the consequences would be far worse for you than it would be for us.
[00:15:55.253 --> 00:15:57.334]  So this is a European super state.
[00:15:57.674 --> 00:15:59.936]  This is what they said was not going to happen.
[00:16:00.076 --> 00:16:02.357]  And yet, we all knew that it was there.
[00:16:02.777 --> 00:16:04.138]  And we've been proven right.
[00:16:04.978 --> 00:16:09.481]  And this is the issue before the British people as they're dragging this out.
[00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:12.763]  As they're going to tell people, you don't want to do this.
[00:16:12.783 --> 00:16:17.065]  You have to understand you were lied to once before and they are trying to still trick you.
[00:16:17.105 --> 00:16:18.386]  You need to follow through on this.
[00:16:18.906 --> 00:16:27.448]  Now, when we come back, we're going to have Jakari Jackson, Joe Biggs, and Michael Zimmerman talk about what it's like to be reporters in the midst of a riot.
[00:16:27.848 --> 00:16:32.489]  Because we are going to have reporters that are going to be in the midst, I think, of a couple of riots.
[00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:39.730]  Not only the Republican, but also the Democrat convention, I think, are going to be quite dangerous this year.
[00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:43.211]  They're going to talk to you when we come back about what it's like to be in the middle of that.
[00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:43.631]  Stay with us.
[00:16:43.651 --> 00:16:44.191]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:49.838 --> 00:17:00.282]  On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake.
[00:17:01.362 --> 00:17:05.783]  His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.
[00:17:06.304 --> 00:17:07.364]  Oh well, she cried.
[00:17:07.844 --> 00:17:10.225]  I'll take you in, and I'll take care of you.
[00:17:11.605 --> 00:17:13.086]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:17:13.646 --> 00:17:15.087]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:17.167]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:17:18.188 --> 00:17:18.688]  Sighed.
[00:17:19.912 --> 00:17:20.793]  The Vicious Snake.
[00:17:25.015 --> 00:17:27.296]  This could be the great Trojan horse of all time.
[00:17:27.896 --> 00:17:30.718]  Because you look at the migration, study it, look at it.
[00:17:31.438 --> 00:17:34.020]  Now they'll start infiltrating with women and children.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.821]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:38.742]  Take me in, for heaven's sake.
[00:17:39.543 --> 00:17:41.064]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:17:42.184 --> 00:17:44.786]  Sighed the Vicious Snake.
[00:17:45.976 --> 00:17:48.477]  Now she clutched him to her bosom.
[00:17:48.917 --> 00:17:50.758]  You're so beautiful, she cried.
[00:17:51.558 --> 00:17:55.860]  But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you might have died.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:02.042]  She stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight.
[00:18:03.062 --> 00:18:10.485]  But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:12.586]  I saved you, cried the woman.
[00:18:13.627 --> 00:18:16.229]  And you've bit me, heavens why.
[00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.793]  You know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die.
[00:18:22.774 --> 00:18:26.877]  Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[00:18:27.698 --> 00:18:32.882]  You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
[00:18:38.052 --> 00:18:45.877]  We celebrate the 4th of July as a reminder of earning our independence from a tyrannical and oppressive government.
[00:18:46.057 --> 00:18:52.621]  Just a reminder to the Obama administration, there's plenty of room on the calendar for another holiday.
[00:19:01.781 --> 00:19:08.866]  These were the chaotic scenes as residents of a city in Southeastern Venezuela went on the rampage in search of basic food items.
[00:19:09.646 --> 00:19:15.570]  People desperate for staples like milk, rice and flour stormed a supermarket warehouse in Guayana City.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:25.502]  If you go back to 2007, the British Ministry of Defense came out and echoed a Department of Defense report from here in the U.S.
[00:19:25.542 --> 00:19:37.084]  saying that beginning in the year 2016, right through 2020 to 2030, that they believe there would be massive multi-hundred percent food price increases worldwide.
[00:19:37.944 --> 00:19:45.926]  And that during that global meltdown, that there would be incredible social unrest that would depopulate much of the Earth.
[00:19:46.957 --> 00:19:58.285]  Now, in 2016, Vice Magazine and other publications are reporting on a 2015 report produced by the U.S.
[00:19:58.325 --> 00:20:11.134]  government, the U.N., and scores of foreign nations, as well as the State Department, overseen by food giant Cargill, the World Bank, and most importantly, the World Wildlife Fund.
[00:20:11.815 --> 00:20:12.796]  The World Wildlife Fund
[00:20:13.616 --> 00:20:21.863]  is a eugenics anti-human organization set up by Prince Bernhard who also founded the Bilderberg Group and who was a Nazi officer.
[00:20:22.524 --> 00:20:36.556]  This organization sells environmentalism to make the elite look like heroes saving the earth when in truth they are ushering in a planetary tyranny that is irrevocably damaging the fabric of our planet.
[00:20:37.096 --> 00:20:38.658]  In this new FEMA report
[00:20:39.602 --> 00:20:46.185]  With headline, FEMA contractor predicts social unrest caused by 395% food price spikes.
[00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:59.130]  You learn that this is a report filed with governments and major institutions overseen by a contractor that since the 1940s has been the main advisor for the U.S.
[00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.211]  Navy Marine Corps.
[00:21:00.987 --> 00:21:05.932]  The challenges and crises that we were assigned are exactly what we expect to see in the future.
[00:21:05.992 --> 00:21:06.973]  So you've got famine.
[00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:08.535]  You've got increased pests.
[00:21:08.615 --> 00:21:10.156]  Food prices are going up 400%.
[00:21:11.177 --> 00:21:13.039]  We've got a flood of migrants coming in.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.701]  The world is starting to fall apart.
[00:21:15.021 --> 00:21:17.824]  Everything we do is going to have some negative effect.
[00:21:18.565 --> 00:21:23.270]  Now, all of this said, governments and corporations and institutions
[00:21:23.757 --> 00:21:25.278]  Are stockpiling food and weapons.
[00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:26.059]  They're digging in.
[00:21:26.079 --> 00:21:26.860]  They're getting bunkers.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.484]  Elites are fleeing to places like New Zealand en masse.
[00:21:31.644 --> 00:21:44.896]  We've gone from financial meltdown and huge regional wars being a possibility to being a probability to more and more becoming an inevitability.
[00:21:46.058 --> 00:21:48.720]  Now, the big question is, what are we going to do about it?
[00:21:49.704 --> 00:21:53.987]  The advice I give you is the same advice that I carry out in my own personal life.
[00:21:55.728 --> 00:21:58.449]  Number one, everybody needs to be able to protect themselves.
[00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:01.351]  Everybody needs friends and family they can rely on in crises.
[00:22:01.971 --> 00:22:06.014]  And everyone needs high quality storable foods and high quality water filtration systems.
[00:22:06.614 --> 00:22:08.495]  Not just for collapse when it comes to water filters.
[00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:13.438]  All the garbage in our water, you'd be insane to drink well water or tap water with the glyphosates and all the rest of it.
[00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:18.561]  But we're offering the biggest wide spectrum sale ever on preparedness items.
[00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:23.671]  That's the lowest savings to 40% at InfowarsStore.com.

[00:22:31.555 --> 00:22:33.876]  We also sell their food as well, their full spectrum.
[00:22:34.216 --> 00:22:36.818]  And all of their water filtration systems across the board.
[00:22:37.158 --> 00:22:42.861]  From gravity fed systems like Alexa Pure and Pro Pure, to shower filters, to survival straws,

[00:22:50.135 --> 00:22:51.817]  I know, I personally am getting prepared.
[00:22:52.378 --> 00:22:53.759]  The warning signs are insane.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:23:01.207]  Take advantage, 20-40% off until early next week with the 4th of July Holiday Special at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:23:03.635 --> 00:23:05.577]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:23:05.637 --> 00:23:07.699]  Thank you for joining us on this July 4th weekend.
[00:23:07.759 --> 00:23:10.962]  I'm joined in studio by Joe Biggs and also Michael Zimmerman.
[00:23:11.282 --> 00:23:18.509]  We're going to be talking about some of the things that have happened, not just this year, but pretty much our InfoWars experience as we go around the country and we go to various...
[00:23:18.849 --> 00:23:19.350]  I think so.
[00:23:36.468 --> 00:23:41.852]  Yeah, so the actual first Trump rally we ever attended was myself and Matt Weber.
[00:23:41.872 --> 00:23:43.393]  It was a little over a year ago.
[00:23:43.413 --> 00:23:44.273]  It was his first rally.
[00:23:44.293 --> 00:23:45.034]  It was in Dallas.
[00:23:45.734 --> 00:23:48.056]  And, you know, we went inside.
[00:23:48.076 --> 00:23:48.996]  It was pretty intense.
[00:23:49.016 --> 00:23:51.018]  You know, the crowd was reacting really good.
[00:23:51.458 --> 00:23:53.519]  And I had no idea what was happening on the outside.
[00:23:53.559 --> 00:23:55.541]  I didn't know there was going to be protests at it, really.
[00:23:55.561 --> 00:23:58.303]  I mean, we just went to go cover Trump speaking.
[00:23:58.523 --> 00:23:58.683]  Right.
[00:23:58.803 --> 00:24:02.185]  And, you know, we walk out and Weber's getting his camera stuff ready.
[00:24:02.605 --> 00:24:05.908]  And all you see are these cops on horses and they're like jumping up and down.
[00:24:06.468 --> 00:24:14.200]  There's probably like, you know, 100, 150 people maybe out there in front of the police line screaming and yelling, waving these Mexican flags.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.886]  And you saw some of the communist flags and Black Lives Matter and all that.
[00:24:17.906 --> 00:24:19.929]  And I'm sitting there like, what is going on?
[00:24:22.059 --> 00:24:23.860]  For a rally?
[00:24:24.321 --> 00:24:26.923]  And it just spiraled out of control from there.
[00:24:26.963 --> 00:24:29.825]  I mean, we've all covered almost every single one of them.
[00:24:30.466 --> 00:24:47.480]  Between the three of us and Josh Owens and Rob Dew, things have gotten intense and they've gotten downright violent and the propaganda being pushed by the mainstream media about what's really going on has gotten so out of control that so many people are confused about what's really going on at these rallies.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.802]  The fact that people are trying to go in and out
[00:24:50.262 --> 00:24:58.349]  To go see a presidential candidate speak, and yet what's happening as they come out, they're being spit on, harassed, assaulted, you know, it's crazy.
[00:24:58.869 --> 00:24:59.830]  It definitely is.
[00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:06.976]  Now, Michael, I know we've gone to some of these things as well, and you've also gone to ones that I wasn't there, so can you tell us about some of those experiences?
[00:25:07.236 --> 00:25:09.397]  Yeah, one recent one was in Richmond, Virginia.
[00:25:09.557 --> 00:25:11.498]  You had a bunch of communist protesters show up.
[00:25:11.518 --> 00:25:13.559]  They're waving their... Communists are anarchists.
[00:25:13.579 --> 00:25:14.860]  They're waving their flags around.
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.581]  And they just started attacking these Trump supporters that are walking through.
[00:25:18.601 --> 00:25:23.164]  And I think what you're talking about, this media narrative, has really got out of control.
[00:25:23.224 --> 00:25:27.546]  They're trying to blame this on these Trump supporters that are just trying to go hear a politician speak.
[00:25:28.466 --> 00:25:30.688]  And they show up to these events and they're getting attacked.
[00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:32.070]  It's empowering.
[00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:36.414]  It's empowering these people that go out and carry out these attacks because they know nothing's going to happen to them.
[00:25:36.834 --> 00:25:41.579]  They turn on the TV at the end of the night to get that rush, that high, like did I make the cut?
[00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:42.340]  Am I on there?
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.361]  And all they hear is
[00:25:43.661 --> 00:25:55.008]  Peaceful protesters clash with racist Donald Trump supporters, and these guys are like, wow, I just punched somebody, I damn near killed somebody, and I got away with it, and no one's saying anything, let's keep doing this.
[00:25:55.329 --> 00:25:56.609]  And from there it exploded.
[00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:00.192]  Well, you see the media spin, because when Michael and myself went out to Albuquerque,
[00:26:00.692 --> 00:26:11.862]  That was a scenario where the Trump supporters, where they went into the building rather, you know, fine, calm, but then you had a group of protesters, demonstrators, who came out there and they rushed the barricades.
[00:26:11.922 --> 00:26:15.646]  They run up to the front door, start trying to kick in the door, and it just got worse from there.
[00:26:15.666 --> 00:26:16.847]  Let's take a look at that video.
[00:27:11.493 --> 00:27:11.974]  Shut it down!
[00:27:11.994 --> 00:27:12.334]  Shut it down!
[00:27:59.525 --> 00:28:00.285]  Sean is down!
[00:28:00.305 --> 00:28:01.026]  Sean is down!
[00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:02.126]  Sean is down!
[00:28:40.689 --> 00:28:45.273]  Keep the peace!
[00:28:45.633 --> 00:28:48.115]  Keep the peace!
[00:29:18.183 --> 00:29:18.564]  Shut it down!
[00:29:18.584 --> 00:29:19.124]  Shut it down!
[00:29:19.144 --> 00:29:19.445]  Shut it down!
[00:29:36.267 --> 00:29:37.928]  Shut it down!
[00:29:37.948 --> 00:29:39.489]  Shut it down!
[00:29:39.729 --> 00:29:40.690]  Shut it down!
[00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:47.294]  And that's just one aspect of what happened that night.
[00:30:00.933 --> 00:30:03.995]  Yeah, the behavior of these people is just frankly disgusting.
[00:30:04.395 --> 00:30:11.119]  They were screaming at families, you know, fathers carrying their young daughters, yelling, F you, your kid is going to burn in Trump's camps.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.481]  I mean, these people are just so far out there.
[00:30:14.901 --> 00:30:16.742]  A lot of them, you know, being bused in.
[00:30:16.802 --> 00:30:20.524]  We talked to one guy as we were leaving, one of the more violent protesters that we saw.
[00:30:20.544 --> 00:30:21.985]  You and I both saw him throwing rocks.
[00:30:22.546 --> 00:30:22.826]  He's like,
[00:30:23.446 --> 00:30:25.126]  Oh man, I missed my bus.
[00:30:25.907 --> 00:30:27.187]  That guy was ridiculous.
[00:30:28.027 --> 00:30:31.888]  Because, you know, we were out there and this isn't the guy who hit me with a rock, this is a different guy.
[00:30:32.188 --> 00:30:34.069]  But he's out there throwing rocks and stuff at the cops.
[00:30:34.089 --> 00:30:39.490]  I'm like, so when they start shooting the gas and, you know, possibly rubber bullets, you're going to be on the front line when they start, you know, firing back.
[00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:40.410]  He's like, oh yeah, I'm going to be here.
[00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:41.971]  And then what does he do in the back of the night?
[00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:43.971]  He's way back there behind everybody else.
[00:30:44.371 --> 00:30:46.832]  And this is the mentality of the people who go out there to these events.
[00:30:47.625 --> 00:30:50.168]  Yeah, I think it's just like, it's a thrill for them, maybe.
[00:30:50.188 --> 00:30:54.012]  I don't think they actually believe that they're accomplishing anything.
[00:30:54.032 --> 00:30:58.036]  You know, I think it's these people who just want to be violent for the sake of violence.
[00:30:58.157 --> 00:30:59.418]  It's an excuse to act violent.
[00:30:59.618 --> 00:30:59.798]  Right.
[00:31:00.099 --> 00:31:06.345]  Well, same thing, you know, like you were talking about Ferguson earlier, and, you know, people will riot and they'll burn down
[00:31:07.186 --> 00:31:11.350]  You know, shops and businesses that are owned by their people in their community.
[00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:12.211]  It's your neighborhood.
[00:31:12.231 --> 00:31:28.847]  That's a good way to segue because Biggs and I, we went out to Ferguson and one of the things that was very interesting the night they gave the verdict on the officer, you know, what was going to happen to him, you know, the guy, I believe it was Michael Brown's stepdad, he jumps up in the car, he's like, let's burn this mother effer down!
[00:31:28.867 --> 00:31:29.628]  And then he goes home.
[00:31:30.829 --> 00:31:32.710]  And then people start burning stuff down.
[00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.572]  Guys are raiding cell phone shops like, I gotta do this for Michael Brown.
[00:31:36.592 --> 00:31:38.213]  I'm like, you didn't do any of this for Michael Brown.
[00:31:38.233 --> 00:31:40.494]  I was standing in front of the fire department.
[00:31:40.834 --> 00:31:41.174]  Remember?
[00:31:41.195 --> 00:31:42.635]  Because I was doing the show live.
[00:31:42.675 --> 00:31:43.316]  I was sitting there walking.
[00:31:43.336 --> 00:31:44.676]  I had the tripod or whatever set up.
[00:31:45.197 --> 00:31:49.219]  And as soon as he said that, because they were right in the road in front of us, they stand up on that car.
[00:31:49.239 --> 00:31:51.400]  It was him and his wife, which is Michael Brown's mom.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.480]  Mom or whatever.
[00:31:52.981 --> 00:31:58.525]  They were sitting there, and he jumps up and screams, and all you saw was everyone dispersed, just run.
[00:31:58.985 --> 00:32:07.071]  All the people who knew what was about to happen, all people that stayed were media, cops, and the people that were there to burn that town down, and they did that.
[00:32:07.351 --> 00:32:10.293]  I remember glass shattering across the street at that cell phone spot.
[00:32:10.573 --> 00:32:13.215]  Then someone threw a bottle over my head and it shattered.
[00:32:13.235 --> 00:32:15.577]  Remember that glass at the fire department behind me?
[00:32:15.977 --> 00:32:18.499]  And I'm sitting there like, wow, this is about to happen.
[00:32:18.899 --> 00:32:21.161]  You know, that's some of the most intense writing
[00:32:21.641 --> 00:32:27.746]  I think any of us have been to, but it's gotten close, like Costa Mesa, Josh Owens, those guys were down there.
[00:32:28.326 --> 00:32:32.910]  People jumping in the cars like we saw in Ferguson, doing donuts, almost hitting bystanders.
[00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:34.732]  I mean, that's out of control.
[00:32:36.813 --> 00:32:38.034]  Yeah, hitting people in the face.
[00:32:38.074 --> 00:32:39.936]  I mean, this kid was just like dripping blood.
[00:32:40.036 --> 00:32:40.256]  Yeah.
[00:32:40.396 --> 00:32:40.676]  Why?
[00:32:40.757 --> 00:32:41.177]  For what?
[00:32:41.317 --> 00:32:43.859]  Because you want to make America Mexico again?
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.340]  Get the F out of here.
[00:32:45.941 --> 00:32:47.482]  Look, here's what happens in a war.
[00:32:48.043 --> 00:32:48.643]  You lose.
[00:32:49.004 --> 00:32:50.545]  The people who win take the land.
[00:32:50.925 --> 00:32:51.726]  That's how it is.
[00:32:51.766 --> 00:32:52.206]  Get over it.
[00:32:52.226 --> 00:32:53.207]  Don't be a sore loser.
[00:32:53.487 --> 00:32:54.909]  This is not going to be Mexico again.
[00:32:54.949 --> 00:32:55.769]  This is America.
[00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:56.710]  Fourth of July.
[00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:57.331]  Roger that.
[00:33:17.489 --> 00:33:23.450]  People desperate for staples like milk, rice and flour stormed a supermarket warehouse in Guayana City.
[00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:32.892]  If you go back to 2007, the British Ministry of Defense came out and echoed a Department of Defense report from here in the U.S.
[00:33:32.912 --> 00:33:44.434]  saying that beginning in the year 2016, right through 2020 to 2030, that they believe there would be massive multi-hundred percent food price increases worldwide.
[00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:53.300]  And that during that global meltdown that there would be incredible social unrest that would depopulate much of the earth.
[00:33:54.309 --> 00:34:04.918]  Now, in 2016, Vice Magazine and other publications are reporting on a 2015 report produced by the U.S.
[00:34:04.958 --> 00:34:17.769]  government, the U.N., and scores of foreign nations, as well as the State Department, overseen by food giant Cargill, the World Bank, and most importantly, the World Wildlife Fund.
[00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:19.430]  The World Wildlife Fund
[00:34:20.211 --> 00:34:28.505]  He's a eugenics anti-human organization set up by Prince Bernhard who also founded the Bilderberg Group and who was a Nazi officer.
[00:34:29.126 --> 00:34:30.708]  In this new FEMA report...
[00:34:31.633 --> 00:34:38.219]  With headline, FEMA contractor predicts social unrest caused by 395% food price spikes.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:52.312]  You learn that this is a report filed with governments and major institutions overseen by a contractor that since the 1940s has been the main advisor for the US Navy Marine Corps.
[00:34:52.733 --> 00:34:57.437]  Now, all of this said, governments and corporations and institutions
[00:34:57.921 --> 00:34:59.442]  Are stockpiling food and weapons.
[00:34:59.482 --> 00:35:00.223]  They're digging in.
[00:35:00.263 --> 00:35:01.024]  They're getting bunkers.
[00:35:01.404 --> 00:35:05.687]  Elites are fleeing to places like New Zealand en masse.
[00:35:05.807 --> 00:35:19.058]  We've gone from financial meltdown and huge regional wars being a possibility to being a probability to more and more becoming an inevitability.
[00:35:19.798 --> 00:35:22.521]  Number one, everybody needs to be able to protect themselves.
[00:35:22.681 --> 00:35:25.363]  Everybody needs friends and family they can rely on in crises.
[00:35:26.041 --> 00:35:30.085]  And everyone needs high-quality storable foods and high-quality water filtration systems.
[00:35:30.525 --> 00:35:35.209]  But we're offering the biggest wide-spectrum sale ever on preparedness items.

[00:35:46.779 --> 00:35:49.081]  We also sell their food as well, their full spectrum.

[00:36:07.573 --> 00:36:08.954]  The warning signs are insane.
[00:36:09.454 --> 00:36:16.476]  Take advantage, 20-40% off until early next week with the 4th of July Holiday Special at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:36:16.676 --> 00:36:24.539]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:36:24.799 --> 00:36:26.760]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.662]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:36:29.723 --> 00:36:33.826]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:36:34.147 --> 00:36:37.309]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:36:37.329 --> 00:36:44.596]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:36:44.776 --> 00:36:48.920]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.741]  We are the true media.
[00:36:50.902 --> 00:36:53.484]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:36:53.584 --> 00:36:57.210]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:00.815]  Join us at InfoWarsNews.com and PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:37:04.332 --> 00:37:12.340]  One thing we've noticed a lot of these recent rallies is these protesters, or rioters, will show up with their bandanas already on, they've got their eyes covered, some of them wearing goggles.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:17.024]  You know, they are ready and wanting a violent riot to happen at these events.
[00:37:17.224 --> 00:37:18.625]  These are George Soros people!
[00:37:19.126 --> 00:37:24.951]  I mean, look, we've already got it numerous times, like you guys said, the guy misses bus, and then when I was in Dallas this last time,
[00:37:25.692 --> 00:37:31.675]  I got the police officer, the Dallas PD guy, saying, hey, we've got to get these guys pushed to this side of the road.
[00:37:31.895 --> 00:37:36.937]  We need you guys over here to protect you from these guys so they can get back to their buses that brought them here.
[00:37:36.957 --> 00:37:38.798]  And I was like, hold on, excuse me?
[00:37:39.259 --> 00:37:40.319]  The buses they were brought in?
[00:37:40.339 --> 00:37:40.779]  He was like, yeah.
[00:37:40.819 --> 00:37:43.601]  He's like, these guys just get brought here to do all this stuff.
[00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:45.562]  He's like, these guys are ignoramuses.
[00:37:45.602 --> 00:37:49.703]  You guys are peaceful people actually here to just kind of watch what's going on.
[00:37:49.723 --> 00:37:50.844]  You're not here to be violent.
[00:37:51.104 --> 00:37:52.645]  He's like, these people are brought here to do that.
[00:37:52.705 --> 00:37:53.325]  It's ridiculous.
[00:37:53.365 --> 00:37:54.766]  And the guy's admitting it all right there.
[00:37:55.206 --> 00:38:02.713]  Absolutely, because we saw, you know, after everything that happened in Ferguson, the reports, people going on Twitter, of all things, and saying, I didn't get paid, you know, to protest.
[00:38:02.733 --> 00:38:05.195]  You know, they did get paid, but they didn't get the paycheck.
[00:38:05.235 --> 00:38:05.575]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:05.595 --> 00:38:06.896]  They didn't get the payoff of it.
[00:38:06.976 --> 00:38:14.423]  And this is the mentality of people, to go into somebody else's hometown, somebody else's neighborhood, they'll tear it up, you know, they come from Chicago, you know, wherever they're from.
[00:38:14.443 --> 00:38:15.364]  Ferguson, same thing.
[00:38:15.384 --> 00:38:16.765]  Yeah, and they tear it up, and then they leave.
[00:38:17.105 --> 00:38:20.969]  Because you notice the people who live there, those are usually people who were trying to stop people.
[00:38:20.989 --> 00:38:23.151]  They just went home, you know, when things started to get hot.
[00:38:23.451 --> 00:38:26.153]  It was the people who didn't live there, who lived across town, lived wherever else.
[00:38:26.474 --> 00:38:28.535]  Come, they tear it up, and then they just leave, almost like a locust.
[00:38:28.796 --> 00:38:32.959]  One of the topics I would talk to people about, I'd be like, why do you think that Donald Trump is racist?
[00:38:32.979 --> 00:38:36.363]  And they're like, well, he wants to build a wall to keep out all the immigrants.
[00:38:37.043 --> 00:38:38.684]  I'm like, well, that's just not the fact.
[00:38:38.744 --> 00:38:41.825]  I was like, the walls are gonna slow down the drugs, blah, blah, blah, this and that.
[00:38:42.345 --> 00:38:48.147]  And I was like, it's to put a halt, kind of, to help slow down illegal immigration from happening.
[00:38:48.187 --> 00:38:55.449]  It's not to stop immigration, but these people would use this as their talking point, that building a wall is racist, that's bad, you shouldn't have walls.
[00:38:55.889 --> 00:39:05.072]  Darren McBrain and I were in Eugene, Oregon, at a Trump rally, and the same people who were looking at him and I, calling us a racist for being there because we're at the Trump rally,
[00:39:05.632 --> 00:39:11.901]  We're locking arms and creating a wall to stop people who were inside the Donald Trump rally from coming out.
[00:39:12.501 --> 00:39:18.229]  Literally keeping them in there, enclosed in this area, because there was only like one or two ways in and out.
[00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:20.412]  So these same people who hate walls,
[00:39:21.442 --> 00:39:22.462]  We're creating them.
[00:39:22.482 --> 00:39:23.183]  They create their own walls.
[00:39:23.203 --> 00:39:27.604]  The same one when I was at the Milo event in UCLA in California.
[00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:35.207]  The same people were like, walls are racist, walls are racist, or screaming it while they're creating a wall in front of the event to not allow people over.
[00:39:35.227 --> 00:39:36.568]  It was completely hilarious.
[00:39:37.088 --> 00:39:44.156]  Yeah, and as we think about this, I always think about the personalities that show up at these events, good, bad, or indifferent.
[00:39:44.237 --> 00:39:52.687]  I was out in Atlanta, and I was in a crowd of mainly anti-Trump people, the Trump people already in the Fox Theater, I believe it was.
[00:39:53.367 --> 00:39:56.992]  And, you know, there's this young kid who's out there, and he's doing a chant, a Trump chant.
[00:39:57.432 --> 00:40:00.955]  And I was very interested because this was an anti-Trump group, you know, the area.
[00:40:01.255 --> 00:40:06.460]  So I started filming him and just out of nowhere, this guy comes and starts yelling at the kid.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.742]  He's like, you're a disgrace to America.
[00:40:08.762 --> 00:40:10.924]  Your parents shouldn't like Trump and all this other stuff.
[00:40:11.224 --> 00:40:12.325]  And he's like, thank you, sir.
[00:40:12.345 --> 00:40:14.467]  He's like, yeah, he's a respectful young guy.
[00:40:15.047 --> 00:40:18.090]  You know, he was letting this guy yell at him before he even started to engage him.
[00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:20.732]  And when he did engage him, it was quite the scene.
[00:40:21.653 --> 00:40:22.654]  That's real sad.
[00:40:23.134 --> 00:40:23.915]  He's against you.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.862]  Why would you support a racist?
[00:40:27.942 --> 00:40:31.465]  He's going to send you back to Africa.
[00:40:31.485 --> 00:40:32.345]  That's what he said.
[00:40:32.545 --> 00:40:36.789]  He said send Mexicans back to Mexico.
[00:40:37.049 --> 00:40:42.033]  You are a disgrace to America for being a young black man supporting a racist.
[00:40:42.073 --> 00:40:42.733]  Thank you.
[00:40:42.813 --> 00:40:44.395]  Yeah, that is awesome.
[00:40:45.155 --> 00:40:45.815]  That's sad!
[00:40:45.835 --> 00:40:46.696]  That's awesome.
[00:40:46.756 --> 00:40:50.797]  How does your parents feel about you holding a Trump stamp?
[00:40:50.997 --> 00:40:59.679]  Well, they should scrape to America too, because he doesn't like you or your parents.
[00:40:59.719 --> 00:41:02.880]  He said send Mexicans back to Mexico.
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.941]  He said don't let Muslims here.
[00:41:04.961 --> 00:41:05.221]  Why?
[00:41:05.261 --> 00:41:08.182]  Are you going to let me talk or are you going to yell?
[00:41:08.502 --> 00:41:11.583]  No, I'm telling you because you holding this stuff back and you need to be taught.
[00:41:11.623 --> 00:41:13.263]  We can't have an educated conversation, can we?
[00:41:13.303 --> 00:41:14.084]  We cannot do that, right?
[00:41:14.464 --> 00:41:17.885]  And then kids are telling you against your own people.
[00:41:17.925 --> 00:41:20.005]  He just graduated high school, so she's not a kid no more.
[00:41:20.505 --> 00:41:21.466]  Okay.
[00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:26.067]  What would you tell him when a racist sent a Mexican back to Mexico?
[00:41:26.607 --> 00:41:28.388]  What would you tell a young black man?
[00:41:28.508 --> 00:41:30.869]  I only believe that he's going to send illegals back.
[00:41:31.269 --> 00:41:31.910]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:34.251]  He said in no way send Mexicans back to Mexico.
[00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:34.951]  He said illegals.
[00:41:34.971 --> 00:41:35.851]  Just illegals.
[00:41:35.931 --> 00:41:37.212]  Illegals only.
[00:41:37.372 --> 00:41:39.493]  His wife is not legal.
[00:41:39.553 --> 00:41:40.373]  She's from Europe.
[00:41:40.654 --> 00:41:41.794]  She's legal.
[00:41:41.834 --> 00:41:43.495]  She was born in Europe.
[00:41:43.975 --> 00:41:46.936]  So she has U.S.
[00:41:46.976 --> 00:41:51.757]  citizenship, so that's just because she was born in another country does not mean she has a legal citizenship.
[00:41:51.777 --> 00:41:53.997]  That's fine, you don't have to.
[00:41:54.037 --> 00:41:54.877]  You're a real man.
[00:41:54.957 --> 00:41:58.998]  If he's elected, he would be against you because of your skin color, young man.
[00:41:59.258 --> 00:42:02.579]  And you're probably like 30-something, but you're a black man.
[00:42:02.639 --> 00:42:03.899]  He's against black people.
[00:42:03.939 --> 00:42:05.479]  That's fine, that's fine, thank you.
[00:42:05.499 --> 00:42:07.560]  And go listen to him speak, and he'll prove you wrong.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.020]  There are many black people who support Trump.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.080]  Plenty of them.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:11.741]  I think his VP might be black.
[00:42:13.041 --> 00:42:14.463]  Oh, I thought you saw that rally.
[00:42:14.503 --> 00:42:15.904]  You see a lot of black people.
[00:42:16.024 --> 00:42:17.566]  The media won't show you that though.
[00:42:17.586 --> 00:42:20.049]  More people in there are going to stand up against Trump.
[00:42:20.489 --> 00:42:21.390]  More black people.
[00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:22.111]  You sure about that?
[00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:23.212]  You sure about that?
[00:42:23.232 --> 00:42:27.376]  One of the black people that he asked his security guards to kick out of the rally.
[00:42:27.396 --> 00:42:29.419]  Oh, in Valdosta State?
[00:42:29.539 --> 00:42:30.840]  Oh, they were protesting against him.
[00:42:31.901 --> 00:42:32.402]  What is that?
[00:42:32.422 --> 00:42:34.104]  You cannot protest in a rally.
[00:42:34.144 --> 00:42:35.026]  Why would you do that?
[00:42:35.046 --> 00:42:35.206]  Why?
[00:42:35.226 --> 00:42:35.967]  It's freedom of speech.
[00:42:35.987 --> 00:42:36.928]  We don't go to your rally.
[00:42:36.948 --> 00:42:38.350]  We don't go to your rally.
[00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:41.054]  He does the same thing to white people too, so I don't understand.
[00:42:41.394 --> 00:42:45.620]  He does the exact same thing to white people too, so... And that makes it okay?
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.444]  I mean, if you're going to protest against us...
[00:42:49.725 --> 00:42:50.986]  You should go get educated.
[00:42:51.046 --> 00:42:51.726]  I'm very educated.
[00:42:51.786 --> 00:42:53.126]  Are you educated in economics?
[00:42:53.146 --> 00:42:56.448]  Are you educated in any sort of political background?
[00:42:56.508 --> 00:42:59.129]  I've worked on many campaigns and it's so sad.
[00:42:59.209 --> 00:42:59.649]  It's very vague.
[00:42:59.689 --> 00:43:00.289]  It's very sad.
[00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:19.977]  I worked for our president twice.
[00:43:20.197 --> 00:43:20.537]  Okay.
[00:43:20.817 --> 00:43:22.759]  One of the worst guys ever, but okay.
[00:43:22.839 --> 00:43:24.140]  Oh yeah, one of the worst guys ever.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.661]  Let's look at the condition of our country.
[00:43:25.681 --> 00:43:28.023]  This country was built on love, not hate.
[00:43:28.384 --> 00:43:29.885]  Donald Trump is a hater.
[00:43:30.065 --> 00:43:30.666]  That's fine.
[00:43:30.806 --> 00:43:31.426]  He's a racist.
[00:43:31.486 --> 00:43:32.147]  He's not, he's not.
[00:43:32.187 --> 00:43:32.827]  He is a racist.
[00:43:33.008 --> 00:43:35.710]  You know this country is built on religion, not hate.
[00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:36.671]  He believe in hate.
[00:43:36.711 --> 00:43:38.852]  You know this country is built on religion.
[00:43:38.892 --> 00:43:42.155]  Do you know the history of his grandfather and father?
[00:43:42.255 --> 00:43:43.917]  They was KK members.
[00:43:44.777 --> 00:43:47.400]  They own real estate in New York.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.461]  How do you know that?
[00:43:48.521 --> 00:43:49.241]  Go Google it.
[00:43:49.281 --> 00:43:52.464]  No, you Google it because I want to see your facts.
[00:43:52.564 --> 00:43:54.066]  You have very horrible facts.
[00:43:54.086 --> 00:43:59.571]  You're calling me to lie so I don't know if I can believe this.
[00:43:59.591 --> 00:44:02.914]  That was his grandfather and his father was KKK members.
[00:44:03.014 --> 00:44:03.574]  Okay.
[00:44:03.594 --> 00:44:04.575]  Go read the history.
[00:44:04.655 --> 00:44:05.896]  KKK members you mean?
[00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:06.117]  Yes!
[00:44:06.157 --> 00:44:06.897]  KKK members.
[00:44:06.917 --> 00:44:08.158]  They was Ku Klux Klan's men.
[00:44:08.339 --> 00:44:08.819]  KKK.
[00:44:09.059 --> 00:44:09.860]  Klan's men, okay.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:11.301]  Who's against your color?
[00:44:11.321 --> 00:44:13.002]  Against your skin?
[00:44:13.062 --> 00:44:15.324]  Against your people and your ancestors?
[00:44:15.344 --> 00:44:16.504]  Let me tell you.
[00:44:16.584 --> 00:44:17.405]  I'm for the people.
[00:44:17.465 --> 00:44:22.688]  It's not because I'm a Democrat or Republican.
[00:44:22.969 --> 00:44:23.809]  I'm for the people.
[00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:26.611]  The people are united.
[00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:28.232]  We'll never be defeated.
[00:44:28.312 --> 00:44:30.234]  And that's what I believe in.
[00:44:30.294 --> 00:44:33.236]  Donald Trump trying to divide the country.
[00:44:33.276 --> 00:44:34.376]  He's not trying to divide us.
[00:44:34.396 --> 00:44:36.738]  He's trying to unite us.
[00:44:36.758 --> 00:44:38.439]  Jessica's policies are not like yours.
[00:44:38.459 --> 00:44:39.900]  That doesn't mean he's not trying to unite us.
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.721]  I said policies.
[00:44:41.942 --> 00:44:42.682]  Policies?
[00:44:42.722 --> 00:44:44.223]  Yes, he was spitting at me.
[00:44:44.263 --> 00:44:49.027]  When a person tell masochist to, he gonna build a wall to send them back to their country?
[00:44:49.047 --> 00:44:49.728]  What do you mean a wall?
[00:44:49.748 --> 00:44:52.370]  Because we have so much illegal immigration, that's why!
[00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:53.411]  Look at his wife!
[00:44:53.831 --> 00:44:54.852]  How do you think she got here?
[00:44:54.872 --> 00:44:55.653]  She's legal!
[00:44:55.673 --> 00:44:57.194]  She's not legal!
[00:44:57.214 --> 00:44:58.235]  She's from Europe!
[00:44:58.615 --> 00:45:00.256]  There's a way to legally immigrate.
[00:45:00.276 --> 00:45:00.717]  Exactly!
[00:45:01.377 --> 00:45:03.219]  Do you not, do you not know that?
[00:45:03.239 --> 00:45:03.880]  You don't know that.
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.462]  Oh my God, just stop it.
[00:45:05.482 --> 00:45:08.266]  Yeah, because you don't know anything.
[00:45:08.286 --> 00:45:14.834]  You need to go learn how to spell your first name, go to college, get a high school education, and then you come back and talk to me.
[00:45:14.874 --> 00:45:15.254]  Thank you.
[00:45:15.274 --> 00:45:17.957]  Do you know his own party is trying to get to him?
[00:45:18.017 --> 00:45:19.579]  Because of the racist intention.
[00:45:21.101 --> 00:45:33.429]  Now at the last minute and a half we have, you know, we can't stop but think about the personalities, like I was saying, and all the people we meet at the events that we go to, even some that we didn't attend, whether it's Trigglypuff or, you know, some of these other characters.
[00:45:33.449 --> 00:45:35.531]  Carl the Cuck, Aiden Skrillex.
[00:45:35.991 --> 00:45:40.734]  I just don't understand the mentality of these people who will come out and just yell at people.
[00:45:40.994 --> 00:45:50.921]  They have no argument, whether we go to the abortion events here in Austin and people come up, they're yelling at David Knight's wife and all these ridiculous characters who show up to just wreak
[00:45:51.301 --> 00:46:04.651]  We've literally, at Infowars, created some of the greatest memes and made some of the most infamous people out of these triggered individuals who are crybaby, whiny-ass, un-American, pathetic individuals.
[00:46:05.623 --> 00:46:07.284]  Well, that's an American statement right there.
[00:46:07.584 --> 00:46:15.707]  Now, as we go out to break with these triggered people, these triggered individuals, give you a real quick look at the new merchandise in the InfoWars shop.
[00:46:16.007 --> 00:46:17.428]  You can get your new Come and Take It shirts.
[00:46:17.548 --> 00:46:21.069]  Also, you can get the InfoWars shirt that Zimmerman has over there.
[00:46:21.149 --> 00:46:23.110]  All that is available at the InfoWars shop.
[00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:27.592]  It's a great way to support your country by showing your red, white, and blue off.
[00:46:27.612 --> 00:46:31.274]  Well, it helps us go out to all these events and trigger individuals
[00:46:32.014 --> 00:46:33.275]  Who are horrible human beings.
[00:46:33.795 --> 00:46:39.119]  And it's also a good way for you guys to sit back and laugh and enjoy yourself while learning something at the same time.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.502]  You really are funding the fight against this complete insanity.
[00:46:42.522 --> 00:46:44.563]  Alright, well thank you so much for joining us.
[00:46:44.583 --> 00:46:46.685]  Stay tuned after this for more special reports.
[00:47:05.116 --> 00:47:09.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:16.704]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of brain force.
[00:47:16.944 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.407]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:52.195]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.701]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:46.583]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:48:47.023 --> 00:48:53.706]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:48:54.026 --> 00:49:00.329]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:49:00.389 --> 00:49:13.314]  There are plans here in Texas to put through a high-speed bullet train going from Houston to Dallas.
[00:49:13.854 --> 00:49:16.035]  Now that may sound like a good thing and it could be a good thing.
[00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:27.437]  Except that it's turning into the people who are in between the two cities, people in the rural areas, are literally being railroaded out of their private property rights.
[00:49:27.997 --> 00:49:31.360]  And without private property rights, you are nothing but a slave.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:44.208]  This is another case of eminent domain, and we've seen through Supreme Court decisions, with the Kello decision, and others, where increasingly eminent domain is being used, not necessarily for public use, but for the private use of a corporation.
[00:49:44.708 --> 00:49:55.675]  And then we see with the Keystone Pipeline and now with this Japanese bullet train that is going to be built in Texas that they're working on, we're seeing that being handed over to a multinational corporation.
[00:49:55.695 --> 00:50:01.539]  Now there's also been a bait-and-switch as we've seen this project develop here in Texas.
[00:50:01.559 --> 00:50:07.083]  We're going to talk to one of the judges, one of the county judges in one of the counties affected by this.
[00:50:07.123 --> 00:50:11.546]  And of course, a county judge in Texas is really the chief administrator.
[00:50:12.086 --> 00:50:14.708]  He's kind of like a mayor of a city.
[00:50:15.228 --> 00:50:19.150]  The county judge has that kind of a position in the counties here in Texas.
[00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:29.956]  We're talking to Judge Trey Duhon of Waller County, and he's going to outline to us what the problems are with this, because this is a national issue.
[00:50:30.436 --> 00:50:33.197]  And it is an issue that this country was built upon.
[00:50:33.237 --> 00:50:45.203]  This is the issue of whether or not you will be allowed to own and enjoy the rights to your property, or whether somebody who has better political connections is going to be able to take that from you at their will.
[00:50:45.643 --> 00:50:47.984]  Joining us now is Judge Trey Duhan.
[00:50:48.324 --> 00:50:49.405]  Judge, thank you for joining us.
[00:50:50.105 --> 00:50:51.205]  Thank you, David, for having me.
[00:50:51.225 --> 00:50:52.346]  I appreciate the opportunity.
[00:50:53.183 --> 00:50:56.324]  Now, let's give people an idea of how this has come about.
[00:50:56.344 --> 00:51:03.146]  Because a few years ago, the people in these counties, when it was sold to them originally, they said, hey, this sounds like a good idea.
[00:51:03.206 --> 00:51:04.706]  Maybe this would be something that would be helpful.
[00:51:04.726 --> 00:51:12.408]  But at that time, they said it would be going over existing right-of-ways that were already being used by roadbeds, by power lines, and that sort of thing.
[00:51:12.428 --> 00:51:13.889]  But then they changed that.
[00:51:16.684 --> 00:51:17.324]  That's right.
[00:51:17.745 --> 00:51:26.530]  You know, when this first came about several years ago, because we've been engaged now in this fight now for going on, I think, four years.
[00:51:28.171 --> 00:51:44.840]  That was one of the things that a lot of folks felt pretty strong about, that if you're going to build something of this nature, you should build it along existing infrastructure rather than going out to an area that has a certain way of life and just
[00:51:45.615 --> 00:51:51.737]  Taking land and condemning it and turning it into something it's not.
[00:51:51.817 --> 00:52:02.440]  Obviously, with the bullet train, it comes along with a lot of other things that is not consistent with some of the things that we have here in Waller County.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.681]  Obviously, Waller County, we've always been an agricultural county.
[00:52:07.402 --> 00:52:11.803]  We have a very strong rural and agricultural heritage.
[00:52:12.726 --> 00:52:17.568]  And we do have a lot of growth going on in Boulder County being that we're adjacent to Houston.
[00:52:18.708 --> 00:52:30.033]  But the areas that they're trying to run this train through, it would just create a dead zone instead of being prime residential development or mixed retail or other uses.
[00:52:31.554 --> 00:52:39.897]  Any land adjacent to this project is going to the highest and best use might be, you know, grazing or agricultural.
[00:52:40.553 --> 00:52:42.874]  And that's a problem for a lot of folks in Waller County.
[00:52:43.654 --> 00:52:53.677]  And of course, what it is also is a case of the rights of the few being taken by the multitude and the way in which they're doing this.
[00:52:53.737 --> 00:53:04.640]  You have a lot of concerns about the process that they're going through with eminent domain and the fact that they're trying to take this property when they haven't even decided on the exact route yet.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:09.401]  They're going to take property for a couple of different routes and routes that they won't even use.
[00:53:10.834 --> 00:53:11.914]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:53:11.934 --> 00:53:16.495]  And I tell you, it is disconcerting for a number of reasons.
[00:53:17.675 --> 00:53:27.137]  Obviously, you've got you've got the two elephants in the room with Houston and Dallas that think that this would be the greatest thing, you know, since white bread.
[00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:31.478]  And they're pushing very hard for this project.
[00:53:31.698 --> 00:53:35.899]  And the problem is that we have a number of issues with with the project.
[00:53:35.939 --> 00:53:39.800]  I mean, number one, none of us really believe that this project is going to cash flow.
[00:53:40.778 --> 00:53:42.219]  Um, it's being sold.
[00:53:42.239 --> 00:53:47.904]  The taxpayers are being told that this will be built with private money.
[00:53:48.464 --> 00:54:04.437]  But the fact of the matter is nobody can actually tell us if it's going to be operated that way or if the state of Texas will eventually have to subsidize this because there's really no high-speed rail lines in the world that aren't publicly subsidized to some extent.
[00:54:04.817 --> 00:54:05.118]  Yeah.
[00:54:05.458 --> 00:54:09.141]  It's not a mass transit solution, not at the ticket prices they propose.
[00:54:09.568 --> 00:54:16.013]  You're not going to get the ridership that you need when you can travel between Dallas and Houston on a $50 tank of gas.
[00:54:16.413 --> 00:54:21.057]  Why would a family of four pay over $1,000 for that same trip?
[00:54:21.397 --> 00:54:38.731]  So we have a number of issues, but what has really come to a head that is incredibly troubling is the actions of the rail company, Texas Central Railway, in filing these recent petitions with the Surface Transportation Board
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:55:01.977]  Where they are in effect asking to be exempted from certain regulations and requirements so that they can have the power of condemnation prior to the route being finalized and prior to the environmental analysis being completed, which, by the way, we have a major problem with the way they've done the environmental analysis, because we don't think what they're doing is in accordance with NEPA.
[00:55:01.997 --> 00:55:05.520]  But, you know, that's just that's a major side note, but.
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:19.110]  You know, to think that and to go so far as to even admit that you may take property that you may not eventually use in the final route, I think that's tyranny, to be honest with you.
[00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:19.971]  I can't imagine.
[00:55:20.331 --> 00:55:22.353]  I mean, there has to be a public necessity.
[00:55:22.833 --> 00:55:27.297]  That's a basic tenet when you're going to exercise eminent domain.
[00:55:27.817 --> 00:55:32.341]  And if you're taking land that's not going to be used in the final route, where's the public necessity in that?
[00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:35.972]  Well, I have a problem with the fact that it's a private company that's going to take it.
[00:55:35.992 --> 00:55:41.436]  I mean, you and I both don't believe that this is truly going to be a private company.
[00:55:41.476 --> 00:55:52.203]  What they will do is they will privatize their profits, but if they lose money, as we always see with these massive crony capitalist projects, if they lose money, that's going to be put on the public, on the taxpayer.
[00:55:53.043 --> 00:56:02.110]  But at the same time, if it is a private corporation that's running this thing through, I don't even believe that they ought to be able to take it for the eminent domain.
[00:56:02.671 --> 00:56:03.692]  But it's gotten beyond that.
[00:56:03.752 --> 00:56:11.337]  As we see, first the private corporations take that, and then we have a multinational corporation, like in the case of Keystone Pipeline, comes in and says, well, we're going to take your property.
[00:56:11.638 --> 00:56:15.921]  Now we go to the extent they say, well, we've got a couple of different routes that we want to do here, so we're just going to take
[00:56:16.401 --> 00:56:18.602]  All of this land, even though we may not use some of it.
[00:56:18.922 --> 00:56:22.604]  And then they're taking shortcuts in terms of the eminent domain process, aren't they?
[00:56:24.585 --> 00:56:26.766]  There's no doubt about it that they're taking shortcuts.
[00:56:26.786 --> 00:56:34.569]  And I'll give you just a few examples that I think, you know, kind of outline the shortcuts they're taking.
[00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:41.712]  They, you know, back in April, on April 19th is when they filed these petitions with the Surface Transportation Board.
[00:56:42.233 --> 00:56:47.634]  To be exempted from certain regulations and to go forward and have that condemnation authority.
[00:56:48.374 --> 00:56:51.295]  They did they did so at that time with no notice.
[00:56:52.235 --> 00:56:54.415]  To landowners cities.
[00:56:55.095 --> 00:57:01.616]  Or counties that were affected and then they didn't come out until I think it was on May 4th.
[00:57:03.497 --> 00:57:08.838]  That was 15 days after they found it, but only 5 days before the deadline.
[00:57:09.378 --> 00:57:10.198]  For comments.
[00:57:11.343 --> 00:57:16.007]  On their petition is when TCR publicly announced that they had filed.
[00:57:16.988 --> 00:57:20.751]  These petitions, you know, some 2 to 3 earlier.
[00:57:21.212 --> 00:57:26.236]  And it's like, if it's an open and transparent process, which TCR says that they are doing.
[00:57:26.896 --> 00:57:32.061]  Why why doing this in the middle of the night without any heads up or notice to anybody now?
[00:57:32.141 --> 00:57:32.741]  Thankfully.
[00:57:34.283 --> 00:57:37.846]  We are organized we are not a bunch of backwoods.
[00:57:38.816 --> 00:57:39.816]  We know what we're doing.
[00:57:40.117 --> 00:57:54.461]  We engaged quickly and filed replies and responses to these petitions, along with comments from thousands of individuals that own property between Houston and Dallas.
[00:57:55.202 --> 00:58:00.864]  And the point you made earlier, and let me say this, this is an important issue for everyone.
[00:58:01.164 --> 00:58:04.945]  Everyone that owns property, everybody that pays taxes,
[00:58:05.529 --> 00:58:09.771]  Whether this project is going to come close to you or not, because you're right.
[00:58:10.271 --> 00:58:15.533]  They will absolutely, when this thing fails, and I do believe it's not going to cash flow.
[00:58:16.293 --> 00:58:19.494]  In fact, one of our state representatives, Cecil Bell, very interesting.
[00:58:20.652 --> 00:58:21.833]  Well, that's it for our news tonight.
