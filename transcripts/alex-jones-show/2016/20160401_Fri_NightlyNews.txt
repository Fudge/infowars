[00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:22.029]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:25.792]  It is Friday, April 1st, 2016 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.952 --> 00:00:26.993]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:43.505]  MSNBC says Trump supporters like Alex Jones are prepared to revolt should Donald Trump not get the Republican nomination.
[00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:52.190]  Amid growing signs that Trump may not have the wherewithal to get enough votes on the convention floor, supporters like InfoWars Alex Jones are now preparing to revolt.
[00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:00.354]  Meanwhile, establishment operative Karl Rove says it's time to elect a fresh face to the White House.
[00:01:01.134 --> 00:01:05.416]  It requires lightning to strike, but in this election, lightning is going to strike for somebody.
[00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:11.880]  And in their own words, pro-Trump versus anti-Trump agitators.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.642]  All that plus much more, up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:16.662 --> 00:01:19.323]  If you believe in Donald Trump in 2016, you are a flat-out racist.

[00:03:03.271 --> 00:03:20.284]  Well, once again, MSNBC has taken a clip of Alex Jones out of context to try and make the point that anyone who would speak out against the election cycle and the big steal that's going to take place at the convention this year, that you're just a crazy conspiracy theorist.
[00:03:21.505 --> 00:03:29.691]  Amid growing signs that Trump may not have the wherewithal to get enough votes on the convention floor, supporters like InfoWars' Alex Jones are now preparing to revolt.
[00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:33.607]  Be in Cleveland for the week of that convention.
[00:03:34.428 --> 00:03:34.868]  Be there.
[00:03:35.408 --> 00:03:38.751]  And we are going to absolutely show the world the real power.
[00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:57.205]  We need 5 million constitutional Trumpians, Trumpists, to be there so that all the Soros trash and all the filth, the few hundred thousand they'll have there, are totally dwarfed and the establishment does not dare steal the popular vote from the people.
[00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:05.240]  According to one party operative I spoke to a couple weeks ago, Republican National Committee named Curly Hoagland, the popular vote doesn't matter at all.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.709]  It's the delegates who really pick the nominee, regardless of how the citizens in their states voted.
[00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.141]  See, at MSNBC, it's terrible to revolt in the name of saving this republic.
[00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:24.724]  It's only okay for you to go out there and revolt if you're an anti-Trump agitator, because they know that that is not going to do anything to stop the establishment.
[00:04:25.184 --> 00:04:30.986]  Now, obviously Alex Jones is making the point that it's important for millions of people to show up.
[00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:36.289]  To these conventions so that your voices can be heard because they're going to steal this election.
[00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:43.833]  And the only way that you might possibly be able to stop that is if you have the numbers there to show that they indeed did steal this.
[00:04:44.714 --> 00:04:59.563]  And of course, Chris Hayes went on to discuss how the RNC leaders have numerous times over the past few months asserted that the popular vote and primary results don't matter to RNC delegates and that they can vote against the will of the people.
[00:05:00.143 --> 00:05:04.505]  But you know what, your votes don't matter at the Democratic National Committee as well.
[00:05:04.605 --> 00:05:05.705]  They don't care about you.
[00:05:05.766 --> 00:05:08.287]  It's already been stacked in favor of Hillary Clinton.
[00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:19.532]  People have been showing up in droves to support Bernie Sanders, but it doesn't matter because there's no way, he pretty much has zero chance that he's going to be able to catch up with Hillary's delegate lead.
[00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:21.352]  But that's not going to stop them.
[00:05:21.713 --> 00:05:24.634]  Obviously the media is wanting to just say that it's the Republican
[00:05:25.174 --> 00:05:36.256]  The Republican Party that has this problem with the whole delegate system, and they're already beginning to lay the groundwork, preparing the public to be ready for a nominee that is not Donald Trump.
[00:05:36.976 --> 00:05:47.879]  A Bloomberg Politics National Poll in March showed that 63% of Republican voters support Trump's view that the candidate with the most delegates and voters should win the nomination.
[00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:49.959]  But of course, party rules dictate
[00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.659]  I don't
[00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:20.879]  We're good to go.
[00:06:43.633 --> 00:06:59.649]  Something like that with the two-party system being destroyed could very well happen if we the people would work together and unite against a common enemy rather than fighting amongst each other this whole divide and conquer which is keeping us from taking down the real
[00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:09.313]  There's a lot of rulers out there who are trying to steal this election and making you think that Donald Trump is racist, xenophobic, whatever, all these buzzwords that the kids are out there saying.
[00:07:09.813 --> 00:07:25.159]  And then of course they roll out Karl Rove from whatever rock he's been under and he comes out to say that instead of nominating any of the Republican candidates, a fresh face might be the thing that could give us a chance to turn this election around and win in November against Hillary.
[00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:29.181]  That's right, someone with absolutely zero votes.
[00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:38.066]  We could come out of the convention in relatively strong position because we do have, you know, look, Donald Trump excites a lot of enthusiasm.
[00:07:38.466 --> 00:07:43.689]  He also excites a lot of anger within the Republican Party and outside of the Republican Party.
[00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:50.154]  And a fresh face might be the thing that could give us a chance to turn this election and win in November against Hillary.
[00:07:51.243 --> 00:07:57.508]  So then he goes on to say that we've got numbers on Kasich and in a lot of these polls he's actually beating Hillary Clinton.
[00:07:57.688 --> 00:07:59.249]  What polls are you talking about?
[00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:01.590]  He won one state.
[00:08:02.191 --> 00:08:02.791]  One state!
[00:08:02.831 --> 00:08:07.855]  And he's still in there keeping the votes away from the other two candidates that are out there.
[00:08:08.235 --> 00:08:14.718]  And just saying that a fresh face that nobody even knows who they're going to roll out at the convention might be what's needed to beat Hillary.
[00:08:14.778 --> 00:08:19.640]  So that's, they're just letting you know that they're going to choose who your leader can be.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:37.347]  Meanwhile, they're going to brainwash all of the students and everyone out there to be reactive to these buzzwords of racism and sexism and xenophobia and all this stuff to the point where if someone writes in chalk on the sidewalk, Trump 2016, you can have the school administrator
[00:08:37.807 --> 00:08:39.248]  I mean, we are creating a country full of sissies.
[00:08:53.519 --> 00:09:05.226]  Now, in light of this chalking, as it's being called, it might be surprising to learn that on campuses across the country, students are actually speaking out and standing up for Donald Trump.
[00:09:05.926 --> 00:09:08.808]  And these are kids from all different backgrounds.
[00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:14.611]  They're organizing, creating t-shirts, slogans, stickers, all sorts of things.
[00:09:15.171 --> 00:09:24.076]  They're making phone calls, taping up flyers, and blanketing Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat in an effort to persuade their peers that Donald Trump is the man.
[00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:44.068]  Of course, they're vastly outnumbered nationwide by their left-leaning classmates who are feeling the burn, but these young GOP supporters say that they're similarly inspired by the hope of a radically different future, and they're eager to support a leader who strikes them as anti-establishment and who's willing to speak his mind.
[00:09:44.508 --> 00:09:59.226]  So not only are they standing up for Donald Trump, but really they're standing up for the freedom of speech and the fact that all across the country they're trying to tamp down on people's free speech if they dare say they want to vote for Donald Trump.
[00:09:59.586 --> 00:10:00.988]  That's absolutely upsetting.
[00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:22.557]  If we allow these types of things to continue to go on, where people can't even speak their mind without the Thought Police showing up, we're going to turn into the UK, where they actually do have the Thought Police now sending out a tweet saying, think before you post, or you may receive a visit from us this weekend.
[00:10:22.777 --> 00:10:24.358]  This is the UK police.
[00:10:24.718 --> 00:10:28.179]  They are threatening home visits for inaccurate tweets.
[00:10:28.939 --> 00:10:30.620]  The Greater Glasgow Police Force
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.583]  They've threatened people with home visits if they send out inaccurate, hurtful tweets.
[00:10:36.164 --> 00:10:38.285]  And this message was posted yesterday.
[00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:40.367]  It says, think before you post.
[00:10:40.527 --> 00:10:42.468]  You may receive a visit from us this weekend.
[00:10:42.828 --> 00:10:44.570]  Use the internet safely.
[00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:51.655]  And so, of course, this prompted a bunch of people to point out, oh look, it's the thought police threatening people's universal rights.
[00:10:52.035 --> 00:10:58.260]  And another person said, I never thought I'd see the day when the internet police became a real thing.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:08.104]  So that's coming to a city near you, kids, if you keep having issues with people writing in chalk or marker on the white erase board.
[00:11:08.464 --> 00:11:17.768]  We have a whole bunch of crybaby fascists being raised up in this country, and now it is time to fight that fascism with facts.
[00:11:18.148 --> 00:11:20.910]  And that's what our guys have been doing on the ground at these Trump rallies.
[00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:27.092]  In fact, they've just set the cameras up and allowed both sides to speak their mind.
[00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:27.793]  Take a look.
[00:11:28.633 --> 00:11:30.214]  This is my third Trump rally.
[00:11:30.254 --> 00:11:35.098]  I was at the one in Chicago, it was shut down and I'm here to exercise my right to free speech.
[00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:45.246]  I'm here because I'm supporting students of color at Lawrence and the people of color in America and in Appleton and all around that are not, that feel threatened, that don't feel safe because of this exact kind of gathering.
[00:11:45.286 --> 00:11:46.167]  Why do you hate Trump?
[00:11:47.008 --> 00:11:50.411]  Because he is sexist and what he stands for is wrong.
[00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:52.152]  I mean, we need immigrants.
[00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:55.194]  We all were immigrants at once.
[00:11:56.653 --> 00:11:57.855]  I don't think he's saying we don't need immigrants.
[00:11:57.875 --> 00:11:59.677]  I think he's saying we don't need illegal immigration.
[00:12:00.037 --> 00:12:02.340]  Well, I can understand that.
[00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:06.846]  I mean, going through the proper channels would be the right way, but we don't need to build a wall.
[00:12:06.866 --> 00:12:09.410]  I mean... Well, what would a wall do?
[00:12:10.522 --> 00:12:12.003]  Um, be ridiculous?
[00:12:12.063 --> 00:12:13.803]  We can't let everybody in.
[00:12:14.243 --> 00:12:16.364]  Let the country take care of their people.
[00:12:16.744 --> 00:12:18.445]  We can't take care of everybody.
[00:12:18.745 --> 00:12:20.205]  We're going down the hole for it.
[00:12:20.405 --> 00:12:23.906]  I gotta know who to let, who to help, and who not to.
[00:12:23.966 --> 00:12:25.307]  Not the whole world.
[00:12:25.547 --> 00:12:26.287]  We can't.
[00:12:26.347 --> 00:12:28.088]  We have to strengthen our country.
[00:12:28.188 --> 00:12:29.848]  We have to strengthen our military.
[00:12:29.928 --> 00:12:31.129]  Arguments are based on hate.
[00:12:31.809 --> 00:12:32.709]  No, they're not.
[00:12:33.229 --> 00:12:34.830]  Vote Trump, get dumped!
[00:12:36.232 --> 00:12:37.593]  Make America Drunk again!
[00:12:37.613 --> 00:12:41.594]  Excuse me?
[00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:43.355]  I heard an immature comment over there.
[00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:45.856]  Well, there's plenty coming from your part of the side too, alright?
[00:12:46.076 --> 00:12:47.036]  I'm not talking about that one.
[00:12:47.156 --> 00:12:48.096]  I'm over here right now.
[00:12:48.357 --> 00:12:49.677]  You're done talking to me?
[00:12:49.777 --> 00:12:50.837]  Okay, so I win that one?
[00:12:50.877 --> 00:12:51.378]  No, you win.
[00:12:52.498 --> 00:12:53.559]  Nobody wins!
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:59.986]  You understand the difference?
[00:13:00.006 --> 00:13:04.692]  You understand that Trump's not against legal immigration, right?
[00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:07.735]  He's not against Mexicans who are legally here, right?
[00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:08.475]  Yes, I do.
[00:13:08.696 --> 00:13:09.256]  Okay.
[00:13:09.356 --> 00:13:12.598]  So what's your problem with him being against people who break law?
[00:13:12.718 --> 00:13:22.004]  So I'm saying, no, you do not have permission to walk around videotaping women of color and acting like you can do this and the rest of us can't.
[00:13:22.064 --> 00:13:26.947]  Aren't you quite aware by holding that video camera on me that you are surrounded by your privilege?
[00:13:27.487 --> 00:13:27.767]  Right?
[00:13:28.048 --> 00:13:30.650]  Take your privilege somewhere else, please.
[00:13:46.022 --> 00:13:49.363]  Well, I was that's not my problem.
[00:13:49.423 --> 00:13:51.584]  He wants to deport Mexicans.
[00:13:51.624 --> 00:13:56.626]  He wants to make Muslims where identification and he doesn't want
[00:14:06.449 --> 00:14:10.631]  ISIS infiltrators who have said they will come in with Syrian refugees.
[00:14:10.831 --> 00:14:12.131]  He wants to vet those people.
[00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:13.411]  That sounds crazy to me.
[00:14:13.512 --> 00:14:14.872]  It sounds like Hitler.
[00:14:14.892 --> 00:14:15.092]  Hitler!
[00:14:15.152 --> 00:14:16.192]  It sounds like Hitler.
[00:14:16.433 --> 00:14:22.615]  If you don't like the system or the people who live in Mexico don't like the system in Mexico, stay there and fix their system in Mexico.
[00:14:22.815 --> 00:14:25.636]  Don't come here trying to change us into a third world hellhole.
[00:14:25.856 --> 00:14:26.516]  But you know what?
[00:14:26.636 --> 00:14:32.398]  Is those same people that came that are putting food on your table, vegetables and everything else?
[00:14:32.478 --> 00:14:33.758]  I grow my own food.
[00:14:33.798 --> 00:14:34.999]  Hey, check yourself, dude.
[00:14:35.439 --> 00:14:35.960]  Can we do it?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.440]  Yes we can!
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:36.941]  Can we do it?
[00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:37.442]  Yes we can!
[00:14:50.518 --> 00:14:54.621]  I'm voting for Trump because I want jobs, not welfare.
[00:14:54.721 --> 00:14:57.143]  I don't want to be a slave anymore.
[00:14:57.163 --> 00:14:58.544]  You're going to be a slave?
[00:14:58.584 --> 00:15:00.145]  No, I'm not.
[00:15:00.426 --> 00:15:01.206]  I want a job.
[00:15:01.547 --> 00:15:03.248]  I want to work for my own money.
[00:15:03.468 --> 00:15:05.870]  I want to have my own house.
[00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:10.273]  I want to pay for my own stuff with my money that I made before.
[00:15:10.393 --> 00:15:11.915]  I don't want handouts.
[00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:13.496]  I don't want handouts.
[00:15:13.716 --> 00:15:14.957]  I want freedom.
[00:15:15.117 --> 00:15:16.818]  I want actual freedom.
[00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.051]  I just gave you what you wanted!
[00:15:25.151 --> 00:15:27.611]  I just gave y'all what you wanted!
[00:15:27.731 --> 00:15:29.692]  It's a f***ing circus, everybody!
[00:15:29.732 --> 00:15:30.012]  Look!
[00:15:30.052 --> 00:15:30.452]  Look!
[00:15:30.572 --> 00:15:31.853]  Look at the monkey!
[00:15:31.893 --> 00:15:34.453]  Look at the monkey!
[00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:35.774]  I did that on purpose!
[00:15:36.094 --> 00:15:36.494]  See them?
[00:15:36.614 --> 00:15:37.454]  Look at them in the eye.
[00:15:37.474 --> 00:15:38.395]  Yeah.
[00:15:38.415 --> 00:15:43.216]  Look at them in the eye, because we're going to be fighting against them.
[00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:44.957]  Learn from that.
[00:15:44.997 --> 00:15:46.157]  Just look at them in the eye.
[00:15:46.597 --> 00:15:46.837]  Right?
[00:15:47.437 --> 00:15:48.618]  And this one, too.
[00:15:48.638 --> 00:15:49.338]  Look at another one.
[00:15:50.231 --> 00:16:09.386]  If you're going to have the audacity to sit up here and say you believe in Donald Trump in 2016, you are flat out racist.
[00:16:33.507 --> 00:16:34.394]  I don't know what's going on.
[00:16:36.918 --> 00:16:37.678]  This right here.
[00:16:38.318 --> 00:16:38.798]  Plain and simple.
[00:16:38.878 --> 00:16:39.519]  This right here.
[00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:40.559]  Nothing else.
[00:16:40.859 --> 00:16:41.799]  Nothing else.
[00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:42.179]  Black.
[00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:43.239]  Your skin color.
[00:16:43.379 --> 00:16:45.340]  The good old white days are over with.
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.720]  The good old white days are over with.
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.700]  Ain't no more of them days, bruh.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.581]  It's over.
[00:16:50.621 --> 00:16:52.121]  That's not racist.
[00:16:52.241 --> 00:16:53.061]  I'm racist though.
[00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:53.841]  I'm racist.
[00:16:53.881 --> 00:16:54.941]  That's not racist.
[00:16:55.121 --> 00:16:56.382]  I'm racist.
[00:16:56.422 --> 00:17:00.202]  You've never experienced oppression in your entire f***ing life.
[00:17:00.462 --> 00:17:03.483]  Neither have I. You're a f***ing white male!
[00:17:05.267 --> 00:17:13.750]  Well, breaking from the tradition of never endorsing a candidate during the presidential primary, the National Border Patrol Council has endorsed Donald Trump for president.
[00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:21.012]  And so now we have radical leftists pushing against these agents' attempts to do this.
[00:17:21.652 --> 00:17:26.794]  Radical leftists pushing for an open borders agenda are attempting to destroy their ability.
[00:17:26.834 --> 00:17:33.296]  This is over 80% of our nation's border patrol agents who are wanting to speak out and sound the alarm to the public and to Congress.
[00:17:34.056 --> 00:17:45.932]  And the Huffington Post reported that Not One More is a prominent immigrant rights activist group and that they were behind an effort to kick out the National Border Patrol Council from its ranks.
[00:17:46.692 --> 00:17:51.499]  And Not One More stands for no more illegal aliens should be deported from the U.S.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:58.064]  Now, the Trump campaign came out and said that they would listen to the agents and the NBPC.
[00:17:58.124 --> 00:17:59.845]  That's how Trump would secure the border.
[00:17:59.925 --> 00:18:06.509]  And so this is, of course, they're going to be able to hold Trump accountable if he doesn't follow through on his promises.
[00:18:07.109 --> 00:18:19.377]  Meanwhile, while a Mexican news team was filming a segment on cross-border shootings, two alleged drug smugglers were caught on live TV sneaking into the United States over the border fence.
[00:18:19.637 --> 00:18:20.557]  They landed on U.S.
[00:18:20.657 --> 00:18:29.861]  soil, made their way along the fence, one made a phone call, and then the pair then hunted for cover once they saw that the film crew was recording them.
[00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.602]  And they were like, you stop recording us!
[00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:36.184]  And then they went and made a phone call and the camera crew said, you know, I'm only doing my job, son.
[00:18:36.584 --> 00:18:44.467]  So, of course, this is an incredibly dangerous job that film crew, their life is probably in danger now that they're actually daring to report on the cartels.
[00:18:44.888 --> 00:18:45.468]  But you know what?
[00:18:45.888 --> 00:18:48.351]  That type of thing doesn't matter to this current administration.
[00:18:48.431 --> 00:18:54.877]  In fact, President Obama will probably say it's not even true that that happened, much like he will not say Islamic terrorism.
[00:18:55.258 --> 00:18:56.879]  We're going to talk about that coming right up.
[00:19:02.085 --> 00:19:05.789]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very, very carefully.
[00:19:06.533 --> 00:19:14.485]  Because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many, many people around me.
[00:19:15.026 --> 00:19:21.455]  I was a big sports enthusiast, but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old up to about 22 or so.
[00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:28.102]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:34.408]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work, I stopped working out.
[00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:39.193]  And everything was okay for four or five years, but then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:43.096]  And in the next 10 years, I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:56.459]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances, and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight, and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.040]  I even changed my diet.
[00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.742]  I even increased the exercise.
[00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:00.303]  It didn't work.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:06.190]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed
[00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.177]  My whole life changed.
[00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:14.844]  I've gone from 200 and almost 80 pounds down to about 220 pounds or so.
[00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:16.446]  It is incredible.
[00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:24.635]  And in just the last three years, Super Male Vitality, developed by Dr. Grube for mfulworthslife.com exclusively,
[00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:32.462]  And products like the Survival Shield X2 Nascent Ionine have just done incredible things for my body.
[00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:40.090]  I work out less, even though I'm older, I've lost more weight, my muscles got stronger, my stamina, my libido, and so much more.
[00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:46.455]  The truth is, we went out to bring you the very best we could, true game-changing products.

[00:21:33.164 --> 00:21:34.445]  You can't survive without it.
[00:21:34.645 --> 00:21:35.546]  But where do you get it?
[00:21:35.846 --> 00:21:41.611]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:21:41.832 --> 00:21:47.557]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[00:23:05.074 --> 00:23:15.598]  Since the beginning of written history, over 6,000 years ago, cultures from India to the Middle East to North Africa dreaded the locusts.
[00:23:16.819 --> 00:23:18.040]  They still do today.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:31.566]  The villagers would get their blankets together, they'd get their rakes together, their household tools.
[00:23:34.454 --> 00:23:44.543]  Like sweepers, brooms, and they would go out and sometimes for days fight the locusts, knocking them off of the different plants that they were growing.
[00:23:48.526 --> 00:23:59.876]  But in a matter of 10-20 minutes, a large flock of locusts, a large swarm of locusts to be technical, could destroy a crop and eat it to the ground.
[00:24:01.305 --> 00:24:03.466]  And they didn't just eat the fruit of the crop.
[00:24:03.486 --> 00:24:05.307]  They didn't just eat the grain of the crop.
[00:24:05.727 --> 00:24:21.296]  They would eat the entire plant, all the way to the ground, and then go into the ground and plant eggs on the roots, killing everything in their path, turning North Africa into the Sahara today.
[00:24:25.219 --> 00:24:30.122]  You add humans with goats to that, the fact that goats and sheep also pull up the roots and eat those.
[00:24:30.683 --> 00:24:31.363]  Cows don't.
[00:24:31.783 --> 00:24:32.504]  They leave the roots.
[00:24:33.525 --> 00:24:34.085]  Deer don't.
[00:24:34.145 --> 00:24:34.866]  They leave the roots.
[00:24:37.147 --> 00:24:38.848]  But goats and sheep, they don't.
[00:24:39.329 --> 00:24:48.955]  And it turned North Africa, that just four, five, six thousand years ago was lush, green, tropical, in most areas, into the hellish desert it is today.
[00:24:50.536 --> 00:24:52.478]  And you ask, why am I talking about that?
[00:24:52.578 --> 00:24:54.019]  Well, I happen to have an article right here.
[00:24:55.267 --> 00:24:57.492]  From Free Beacon, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:24:58.033 --> 00:25:02.943]  Number of Californians moving to Texas hits highest level in nearly a decade.
[00:25:05.709 --> 00:25:26.454]  You would think that the locust coming here would not try to reinvent what they'd already done and create higher taxes, regulations, Agenda 21, anti-family operations, basic trendiness, banning of guns, bringing in unskilled labor to drive out their own wages and to bankrupt them.
[00:25:26.714 --> 00:25:28.034]  But no, they don't know.
[00:25:28.174 --> 00:25:34.776]  All they know is they have eaten the crops to the ground, they have laid eggs in the roots, and now they're coming.
[00:25:35.905 --> 00:25:43.713]  And they, actually the more conscious ones of every race, color, and creed, brag, you will be blue.
[00:25:43.894 --> 00:25:45.195]  You will be conquered.
[00:25:45.295 --> 00:25:47.057]  You will turn in your guns.
[00:25:47.297 --> 00:25:49.720]  Your children will submit.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.581]  They are ours.
[00:25:51.081 --> 00:25:56.187]  Handgun Control Incorporated in the Austin America Statesman front page of Metro and State years ago,
[00:25:57.261 --> 00:26:03.404]  When I smashed a bunch of their anti-gun rallies with fellow Texans and beat a bunch of their bills, catching the bribery, everything.
[00:26:03.684 --> 00:26:05.144]  I mean, we savaged them hard.
[00:26:05.204 --> 00:26:05.784]  We battled.
[00:26:07.185 --> 00:26:15.268]  The head of Handgun Control Incorporated and the Violence Policy Center, the other representative as well, said, Mr. Jones can try all he wants.
[00:26:15.288 --> 00:26:20.130]  We've got your kids in the schools and we will ban guns in America one day.
[00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.592]  And he celebrated the fact that they got our kids.
[00:26:23.612 --> 00:26:24.232]  And you know what?
[00:26:24.732 --> 00:26:26.193]  For most of us, they do.
[00:26:29.226 --> 00:26:30.166]  They know they're locusts.
[00:26:30.327 --> 00:26:31.307]  They know they rule us.
[00:26:35.949 --> 00:26:39.091]  California is prettier than Texas, so they wanted to stay there.
[00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:39.991]  It's got nice weather.
[00:26:40.251 --> 00:26:40.912]  It's a great state.
[00:26:41.572 --> 00:26:43.053]  They've destroyed it in most areas.
[00:26:44.874 --> 00:26:47.055]  And now they're sending their forces in.
[00:26:48.263 --> 00:26:52.486]  And we've played the clips from Project Veritas where they have meetings with thousands of people and it's military run.
[00:26:52.506 --> 00:26:54.088]  They're like, our cohorts are here.
[00:26:54.148 --> 00:26:54.968]  Prepare to take over.
[00:26:55.169 --> 00:26:55.909]  Election fraud.
[00:26:56.089 --> 00:26:57.070]  We will get the IDs.
[00:26:58.211 --> 00:26:59.572]  We will get the welfare.
[00:26:59.612 --> 00:27:00.673]  We will bring in more ops.
[00:27:00.753 --> 00:27:01.654]  We will implode.
[00:27:01.874 --> 00:27:03.235]  We will bring in communism.
[00:27:03.395 --> 00:27:04.015]  They will submit!
[00:27:04.116 --> 00:27:05.677]  And then play the clips?
[00:27:07.518 --> 00:27:08.999]  How about the clergy response team clips?
[00:27:09.019 --> 00:27:11.361]  How about the clips of the young kids in uniform?
[00:27:13.763 --> 00:27:17.226]  In military parade promising to bring in the takeover.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:31.223]  You see, the truth is, the throngs and the forces, they don't like wealth, they don't like swimming pools, they don't like success.
[00:27:31.643 --> 00:27:34.344]  They want misery, because misery loves company.
[00:27:35.484 --> 00:27:40.586]  And it is an ancient tribal instinct to go in and conquer another group.
[00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:43.547]  Of course, the people conquering Texas
[00:27:44.687 --> 00:27:48.892]  By their sheer socialism and ignorance and social justice warrior behavior.
[00:27:49.773 --> 00:27:52.777]  They will be even further enslaved as well, but they're too dumb to know it.
[00:27:53.017 --> 00:27:57.142]  And all they like is the feeble, ancient, ancestral dream.
[00:27:57.562 --> 00:28:00.386]  The vestigial dream of being a noble conqueror.
[00:28:02.076 --> 00:28:20.989]  And they conquer with diabetes, and with obesity, and with low IQs, and with bogging down the hospitals, and bankrupting things before they collapse, and dumbing everyone down, and destroying language, and being social justice warriors, and drooling, and smelling, and chirping.
[00:28:24.051 --> 00:28:25.232]  And then they're leaders.
[00:28:25.272 --> 00:28:27.713]  They're sorcerers.
[00:28:27.773 --> 00:28:29.735]  They're witch kings.
[00:28:30.595 --> 00:28:37.819]  Like Obama and Hillary and Michael Moore just stand back with hatred of their own throng saying, look at what we have created!
[00:28:38.219 --> 00:28:41.121]  Look at the fall of the West!
[00:28:41.381 --> 00:28:52.367]  And then they just spread their wings and just stinking rotten pus just shoots out like a huge torrent across the land of disease and pestilence and evil and ignorance.
[00:28:55.749 --> 00:28:58.871]  Led by all the vandal haters like Maddow and everyone else.
[00:28:59.963 --> 00:29:02.726]  They're vanguard, just riding America down into the dirt.
[00:29:03.507 --> 00:29:08.453]  Bringing in the most unskilled, the most radical jihadists, just flooding everything.
[00:29:08.694 --> 00:29:15.342]  Saying, don't even check for TB, don't even check for HIV, don't even check for any type of disease, just bring them in!
[00:29:16.783 --> 00:29:17.964]  BANKRUPT EVERYTHING!
[00:29:18.044 --> 00:29:18.864]  MORE RED TAPE!
[00:29:18.984 --> 00:29:20.345]  SHUT OFF THE POWER PLANTS!
[00:29:20.685 --> 00:29:22.186]  SHIP THE JOBS OVERSEAS!
[00:29:22.726 --> 00:29:23.907]  BRING IN THE RED TAPE!
[00:29:24.287 --> 00:29:26.148]  WRECK EVERYTHING, BUT EXEMPT US!
[00:29:26.408 --> 00:29:27.489]  WE RULE!
[00:29:27.729 --> 00:29:28.470]  And they just roar!
[00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:29.870]  AHHHHHH!
[00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:30.971]  YOU'RE OURS NOW!
[00:29:31.331 --> 00:29:31.952]  YES!
[00:29:32.052 --> 00:29:33.753]  It's a roar of domination!
[00:29:36.554 --> 00:29:37.675]  And they are our conquerors.
[00:29:37.715 --> 00:29:38.595]  They are our kings.
[00:29:38.635 --> 00:29:39.476]  They are our lords.
[00:29:39.876 --> 00:29:40.696]  They are better than us.
[00:29:44.379 --> 00:29:44.999]  They are cancer.
[00:29:47.881 --> 00:29:49.002]  They are the conqueror of death.
[00:29:51.685 --> 00:30:01.174]  Again, if cancer had a consciousness, it would think it was winning as it took over, wouldn't it?
[00:30:03.436 --> 00:30:12.704]  And this is cancer with a consciousness, and a will to hurt, and a will to steal, and a will to make everyone dependent
[00:30:13.522 --> 00:30:29.167]  So that these bloated, evil, openly demonic people like Hillary and her controllers can rule over throngs of desperate, hat-in-hand, poisoned, culturally brainwashed fools.
[00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:37.990]  And isn't Trump, with all of his goofy populism and
[00:30:39.282 --> 00:30:40.563]  All the things he does.
[00:30:40.583 --> 00:30:45.125]  Yeah, he is kind of the idiocracy candidate, you know, but like the smartest guy.
[00:30:49.227 --> 00:30:50.468]  In the ship of fools.
[00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.511]  Compared to everything else going on, he's the best option.
[00:31:04.997 --> 00:31:05.818]  They want us poor.
[00:31:05.858 --> 00:31:06.898]  They've said they want us poor.
[00:31:06.938 --> 00:31:09.280]  That's the plan, and you're seeing the process of wrecking the country.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:13.784]  And then there's these poor, hat-in-hand, desperate people going, Hillary, give me free stuff!
[00:31:14.224 --> 00:31:16.486]  Like, Obama, can I have a house, please?
[00:31:17.767 --> 00:31:18.908]  You bet, we're gonna get that for you.
[00:31:19.628 --> 00:31:20.309]  Got blocks, huh?
[00:31:20.449 --> 00:31:21.169]  Sure, baby.
[00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.012]  His real spirit would be like, you think I'm gonna give you anything trash?
[00:31:26.013 --> 00:31:26.873]  And he didn't give her anything.
[00:31:28.835 --> 00:31:30.856]  It was Christian conservatives that gave her a house.
[00:31:31.857 --> 00:31:32.518]  This is a sign.
[00:31:34.977 --> 00:31:36.558]  What he gave her was double unemployment.
[00:31:38.599 --> 00:31:40.961]  What he gave her was a shutdown de-industrialized country.
[00:31:45.784 --> 00:31:50.627]  What he gave her was a system where she has to stay locked up with her kids all day long or she'll get shot.
[00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:57.471]  What he gave her was a world that devils like him can rule.
[00:31:57.491 --> 00:32:00.053]  Because let me tell you something, devils can only rule in hell.
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.581]  They can't exist in a heaven, can they?
[00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:15.287]  So they want to turn everything into a world based on fraud and ignorance and foolishness and bondage and servitude and humiliation.
[00:32:40.165 --> 00:32:41.967]  This is a protest.
[00:32:42.688 --> 00:32:44.510]  And this is a riot.
[00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:48.714]  If you can't tell the difference, then you are part of the problem.
[00:32:48.854 --> 00:32:49.355]  Infowars.com
[00:33:03.556 --> 00:33:06.938]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:14.443]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:33:15.044 --> 00:33:23.409]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:27.772]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:33:28.092 --> 00:33:33.456]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:33:33.676 --> 00:33:34.497]  We're good to go.

[00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:07.152]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:07.413 --> 00:35:21.859]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:22.819]  We're good to go.
[00:35:43.365 --> 00:35:51.211]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:51.371 --> 00:35:56.796]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a 6-day liver detox.
[00:35:56.816 --> 00:36:00.338]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:00.518 --> 00:36:04.522]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:08.545]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:08.865 --> 00:36:09.045]  I'm good.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.663]  Yeah, what's the other candidate running?
[00:37:08.284 --> 00:37:09.225]  I know there's another one.
[00:37:09.245 --> 00:37:10.087]  You got Bernie Sanders?
[00:37:10.387 --> 00:37:12.369]  Yes, that one, definitely.
[00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.913]  I'm definitely more for him.
[00:37:15.053 --> 00:37:16.495]  You like Bernie Sanders, huh?
[00:37:17.056 --> 00:37:17.756]  Yes, I do, yeah.
[00:37:17.776 --> 00:37:20.200]  Why, what do you think Bernie's going to do for you?
[00:37:21.618 --> 00:37:28.364]  Hopefully it just helps the community more and just kind of do some stuff that maybe Barack Obama couldn't do that he promised.
[00:37:28.764 --> 00:37:33.808]  Just a lot of years, same promises, same speeches, just a different way I think.
[00:37:35.049 --> 00:37:36.590]  I do a lot of research on this stuff.
[00:37:36.951 --> 00:37:37.751]  I'm really into it.
[00:37:37.851 --> 00:37:39.252]  The politics and everything.
[00:37:39.272 --> 00:37:40.754]  Are you guys into politics at all?
[00:37:41.554 --> 00:37:42.315]  A little bit.
[00:37:42.455 --> 00:37:44.336]  I'll tell you some of the politics.
[00:37:44.356 --> 00:37:45.998]  Were you out here yesterday?
[00:37:46.278 --> 00:37:46.438]  No.
[00:37:47.019 --> 00:37:47.359]  Why not?
[00:37:48.114 --> 00:37:50.015]  Because there's too many protests.
[00:37:50.596 --> 00:37:51.396]  That's the fun part.
[00:37:51.977 --> 00:37:52.857]  You missed it, man.
[00:37:52.897 --> 00:37:53.858]  It was great.
[00:37:53.898 --> 00:37:54.638]  Speaks his mind.
[00:37:55.199 --> 00:37:58.461]  There's a lot of little high school kids running around calling everybody racist.
[00:37:58.701 --> 00:38:01.063]  Yeah, because they don't know what they're talking about.
[00:38:01.343 --> 00:38:02.704]  Tell me what's wrong with Donald Trump.
[00:38:02.744 --> 00:38:03.505]  He's sexist.
[00:38:03.545 --> 00:38:04.445]  He's racist.
[00:38:04.485 --> 00:38:05.506]  He promotes hate.
[00:38:07.327 --> 00:38:10.609]  That sounds like the same thing I've heard from the high school kids over there yesterday.
[00:38:10.629 --> 00:38:14.032]  Who are you voting for for president?
[00:38:15.273 --> 00:38:15.693]  Not Trump.
[00:38:16.215 --> 00:38:16.636]  Not Trump?
[00:38:16.776 --> 00:38:17.236]  Not Trump.
[00:38:17.316 --> 00:38:18.017]  Is that a candidate?
[00:38:18.117 --> 00:38:19.419]  I didn't know not Trump was a candidate.
[00:38:23.184 --> 00:38:24.245]  I support Hillary.
[00:38:24.425 --> 00:38:25.807]  I also support Bernie.
[00:38:26.688 --> 00:38:27.629]  Okay.
[00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.353]  Trump is not even human.
[00:38:30.573 --> 00:38:30.813]  Okay.
[00:38:31.554 --> 00:38:33.977]  Ted Cruz is also f***ed up.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:46.107]  Okay, I went to one of Bernie's events, and I went to one of his yesterday, yes, as an event to just, you know, to just to go to, just to see what all is about.
[00:38:46.508 --> 00:38:50.831]  And honestly, I felt, I felt appalled by it.
[00:38:51.051 --> 00:38:53.052]  I felt disrespected.
[00:38:53.072 --> 00:38:56.274]  I felt like I was not invited by his
[00:38:57.655 --> 00:39:09.939]  Approach to the to the environment and to everything around it like I felt Seriously, like I was pushed off and I felt like I was not included in his ideas.
[00:39:10.639 --> 00:39:11.279]  What are you doing?
[00:39:11.299 --> 00:39:12.940]  I'm drinking!
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:15.860]  Are you a college student?
[00:39:16.201 --> 00:39:16.461]  No.
[00:39:16.781 --> 00:39:17.181]  What do you do?
[00:39:18.401 --> 00:39:18.921]  Nothing.
[00:39:19.402 --> 00:39:19.782]  Nothing?
[00:39:20.382 --> 00:39:23.843]  We're not gonna shame you don't worry.
[00:39:24.858 --> 00:39:25.559]  You don't have a job?
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.361]  Not right now, no.
[00:39:28.502 --> 00:39:29.343]  How do you afford to drink?
[00:39:30.545 --> 00:39:32.567]  Five dollars, it's not really that much.
[00:39:32.807 --> 00:39:37.152]  It used to be free for females, but then they changed it and it was ten for guys.
[00:39:37.172 --> 00:39:38.714]  That's called supply and demand.
[00:39:40.942 --> 00:39:43.823]  All right, so are you going to vote on Tuesday in the presidential primary?
[00:39:44.083 --> 00:39:44.363]  Yes.
[00:39:44.443 --> 00:39:45.444]  Who are you going to vote for?
[00:39:45.684 --> 00:39:46.984]  Bernie, obviously.
[00:39:47.285 --> 00:39:47.785]  Obviously.
[00:39:48.865 --> 00:39:50.146]  You like free stuff, don't you?
[00:39:51.666 --> 00:39:53.727]  They want free college tuition.
[00:39:53.747 --> 00:39:57.689]  That's what my kids who are in college right now, that's what they like.
[00:39:57.969 --> 00:39:59.049]  Well, who's going to pay for it?
[00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:00.810]  They're not thinking about that.
[00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:01.170]  I am.
[00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.730]  I am.
[00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:04.732]  But what about all the other, you know, the parents that
[00:40:05.592 --> 00:40:06.212]  I would agree with that.
[00:40:28.293 --> 00:40:30.114]  Think about it from George Carlin.
[00:40:30.234 --> 00:40:31.514]  Stay home and masturbate.
[00:40:31.815 --> 00:40:33.735]  At least you're f***ing doing something.
[00:40:33.915 --> 00:40:35.876]  So what makes you want to support Hillary or Bernie?
[00:40:35.896 --> 00:40:39.217]  Who would you pick in the... You know, there's a primary on Tuesday.
[00:40:39.257 --> 00:40:39.898]  Who are you going to vote for?
[00:40:42.719 --> 00:40:43.579]  Do you know what a primary is?
[00:40:46.331 --> 00:40:48.574]  So why do you support Bernie Sanders?
[00:40:48.614 --> 00:40:51.597]  Because he promotes love and not hate.
[00:40:51.697 --> 00:40:52.898]  He wants everyone to work together.
[00:40:52.919 --> 00:40:56.543]  His ideas are unrealistic and I'll be the first person to admit that.
[00:40:56.563 --> 00:40:58.745]  But they're based on love so they must work.
[00:40:59.005 --> 00:41:00.087]  No, that's not even the point.
[00:41:00.147 --> 00:41:04.552]  The point is that he wants to make life easier for everyone and he wants to promote
[00:41:05.179 --> 00:41:05.579]  You know what?
[00:41:05.619 --> 00:41:06.320]  Life ain't easy.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.082]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:41:08.122 --> 00:41:11.565]  What has the government ever done that has been successful?
[00:41:12.225 --> 00:41:15.188]  Aside from going and f***ing Iraq, what have they done?
[00:41:15.268 --> 00:41:17.931]  Okay, well, Bernie to f*** Afghanistan.
[00:41:18.051 --> 00:41:24.337]  Everything, aside from me, f***ing up the government means nothing.
[00:41:24.817 --> 00:41:30.662]  Because, to me, everything that has been done has f***ed up the government.
[00:41:31.623 --> 00:41:32.124]  Okay.
[00:41:32.404 --> 00:41:34.566]  And to me... You might have to ask the question.
[00:41:34.586 --> 00:41:36.488]  If you're gonna... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:36.528 --> 00:41:38.269]  Like what programs has the government done?
[00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:40.031]  Like the War on Drugs, was that successful?
[00:41:40.291 --> 00:41:41.252]  War on Drugs?
[00:41:41.292 --> 00:41:42.373]  Yeah, was that successful?
[00:41:42.793 --> 00:41:44.014]  It has not been yet.
[00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:44.174]  Okay.
[00:41:44.214 --> 00:41:44.795]  Will it be?
[00:41:44.815 --> 00:41:46.857]  What about the War on Poverty?
[00:41:47.017 --> 00:41:48.098]  No, will it be?
[00:41:48.138 --> 00:41:49.159]  You can't end drugs.
[00:41:49.239 --> 00:41:50.280]  Absolutely can't.
[00:42:03.115 --> 00:42:04.316]  Bernie is a shit.
[00:42:04.396 --> 00:42:06.137]  He needs to be elected.
[00:42:06.177 --> 00:42:07.538]  He needs to be up there.
[00:42:07.578 --> 00:42:09.259]  He needs to be up in the elections.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.901]  He's not, and he needs to be up there.
[00:42:11.921 --> 00:42:12.842]  Well, you better be voting.
[00:42:12.942 --> 00:42:13.862]  You better be voting on Tuesday.
[00:42:13.882 --> 00:42:22.148]  I am voting on Tuesday, and he is going to be... I went to his talking, and I need to... He needs to be up there.
[00:42:22.448 --> 00:42:24.370]  Wow, is all this just for me?
[00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:25.510]  I thank them.
[00:42:25.751 --> 00:42:26.231]  Thank you.
[00:42:26.891 --> 00:42:30.354]  I don't understand a word you're saying, but thank you.
[00:42:31.567 --> 00:42:32.327]  Love Trump's feet!
[00:42:32.608 --> 00:42:33.488]  Love Trump's feet!
[00:42:33.628 --> 00:42:34.368]  Love Trump's feet!
[00:42:34.668 --> 00:42:35.729]  Love Trump's feet!
[00:42:35.769 --> 00:42:36.489]  Love Trump's feet!
[00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:40.251]  And you fought for that freedom, for them to stand there and do that?
[00:42:40.531 --> 00:42:40.811]  Oh yeah.
[00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:41.752]  Oh yeah.
[00:42:41.932 --> 00:42:42.612]  They're great people.
[00:42:42.652 --> 00:42:43.633]  They got their own feelings.
[00:42:44.933 --> 00:42:47.134]  You know, everybody's got their own opinion.
[00:42:47.194 --> 00:42:49.916]  I respect everybody's opinion, but I got a very strong one.
[00:42:49.956 --> 00:42:52.497]  I'm out there walking every day, door to door, for Donald Trump.
[00:42:53.627 --> 00:43:05.042]  I've fractured two discs in my back in the military and the VA insurance coverage that I have from that is not even enough to satisfy the IRS insurance mandates.
[00:43:05.843 --> 00:43:07.546]  So I got to pay a fine for that.
[00:43:08.607 --> 00:43:10.608]  And I've seen it with my parents, too.
[00:43:10.628 --> 00:43:12.669]  Their insurance has gone down a lot.
[00:43:13.249 --> 00:43:18.071]  My dad, he's paying over $300 a month now for heart medication.
[00:43:18.091 --> 00:43:21.572]  That used to be like his yearly total for his co-pay.
[00:43:21.592 --> 00:43:23.153]  Are there deductibles that have gone up?
[00:43:23.313 --> 00:43:23.633]  I don't know.
[00:43:23.713 --> 00:43:28.055]  Anyone who's saved money with Obamacare.
[00:43:28.075 --> 00:43:28.575]  Right.
[00:43:29.296 --> 00:43:31.917]  Yeah, no, it's all free health care that you have to pay for.
[00:43:32.037 --> 00:43:37.119]  I think by the time this is over, I think the Democratic Party is going to break up, too, and realize that
[00:43:37.777 --> 00:43:39.058]  That they can't support Hillary.
[00:43:39.518 --> 00:43:41.920]  You know, how's Bernie gonna tell all his people to vote?
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.501]  Okay, it's time to vote for Hillary now.
[00:43:43.841 --> 00:43:45.602]  I don't think they're gonna go for it, you know?
[00:43:46.122 --> 00:43:51.066]  So, yeah, I mean, Trump's just, we gotta have borders or we don't have a country.
[00:43:51.366 --> 00:44:03.073]  I think this thing started out where, oh, let's open the borders as part of globalization, because if we can erase the border, we erase countries, and once we erase countries, we only have one country, and that's one world government.
[00:44:03.393 --> 00:44:04.254]  And that's run by Google.
[00:44:05.234 --> 00:44:06.415]  And it's run by all of them.
[00:44:06.535 --> 00:44:12.781]  I mean, Silicon Valley, just in essence, all, all, you know, venture capitalists were replaced by the CIA and the NSA.
[00:44:13.342 --> 00:44:17.185]  So, yeah, I think people are just just wakening up there.
[00:44:17.305 --> 00:44:21.129]  You know, he kind of broke open, broke it open so people see what's going on.
[00:44:21.149 --> 00:44:22.030]  And I think more and more,
[00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:25.132]  That's why Trump's numbers never go down.
[00:44:25.413 --> 00:44:33.739]  They gradually go up and never go down because every time he goes to another state, people see his rally, he gains support and he continually gains support.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.921]  So I'm totally confident that he's going to win.
[00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:38.303]  Can I do a shameless self-promotion?
[00:44:38.463 --> 00:44:39.704]  Go for it!
[00:44:40.285 --> 00:44:46.850]  Lord Montague on Facebook, we have a band, Lord Montague Theme, if you're in for Warriors, I'm sure you'll enjoy that song.
[00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:49.352]  Got a lot of nice sound bites in there.
[00:44:50.771 --> 00:44:52.146]  Obama and Bush.
[00:45:11.443 --> 00:45:15.928]  Hey, I'm gonna put the link to it at the bottom in the description to go check out Lorde Montague.
[00:45:15.988 --> 00:45:16.609]  Really good band.
[00:45:16.629 --> 00:45:19.612]  I've enjoyed their stuff immensely and I am a bit of a music snob.
[00:45:19.632 --> 00:45:20.493]  I'm a bass player myself.
[00:45:20.653 --> 00:45:21.494]  Love Trumps Hate!
[00:45:21.674 --> 00:45:22.435]  Love Trumps Hate!
[00:45:22.716 --> 00:45:23.436]  Love Trumps Hate!
[00:45:25.888 --> 00:45:30.851]  All right, so we're kind of wrapping up this Trump rally today over in Appleton, Wisconsin.
[00:45:31.231 --> 00:45:32.932]  He may do another appearance tonight.
[00:45:32.952 --> 00:45:36.153]  It looks like MSNBC is going to have a town hall in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
[00:45:36.634 --> 00:45:39.215]  So things are heating up for this primary here.
[00:45:39.535 --> 00:45:41.176]  Ted Cruz isn't really doing much in the polls.
[00:45:41.196 --> 00:45:42.236]  John Kasich is falling.
[00:45:42.617 --> 00:45:46.339]  And the only one that seems to be surging on the Republican end is Donald Trump.
[00:45:46.719 --> 00:45:50.581]  And let me tell you, the line here was literally around the block.
[00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:54.523]  Okay, and they dwarf the size of these protesters.
[00:45:55.223 --> 00:45:59.245]  What's interesting, though, is Bernie Sanders was here yesterday, and I talked to several people in the crowd.
[00:46:00.005 --> 00:46:04.247]  Not one of them said they saw any protests there for Bernie Sanders coming.
[00:46:04.667 --> 00:46:06.528]  So, admitted socialist,
[00:46:07.368 --> 00:46:14.673]  Who comes to your town, wants to raise taxes on everybody, basically lower the standard of living to a least common denominator, and nobody's opposing him.
[00:46:14.713 --> 00:46:15.674]  They're just saying, hey, come on in.
[00:46:16.634 --> 00:46:17.655]  We'll let you say your thing.
[00:46:18.055 --> 00:46:20.197]  Because you're probably going to get the election stolen from you anyway.
[00:46:20.417 --> 00:46:21.257]  But what do we have here?
[00:46:21.578 --> 00:46:23.519]  You have protesters here getting in people's faces.
[00:46:23.559 --> 00:46:24.540]  They're cussing people out.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.781]  And this has been going on pretty much all day.
[00:46:26.841 --> 00:46:28.362]  So it's a little ridiculous.
[00:46:28.422 --> 00:46:31.805]  The protest this morning was a silent one, so there wasn't a lot going on.
[00:46:32.205 --> 00:46:35.187]  But it just makes you wonder what these people really are.
[00:46:35.467 --> 00:46:36.227]  And a lot of them were
[00:46:37.068 --> 00:46:39.811]  High school students, which I think is very interesting too.
[00:46:40.091 --> 00:46:44.955]  Kids that aren't even a voting age, they've been told to come out here and vote, and they've been told what to say.
[00:46:44.995 --> 00:46:50.660]  They all have their talking points ready to go, ready to regurgitate, just literally puke them out on command.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:51.561]  So it's really interesting.
[00:46:51.801 --> 00:46:55.425]  It's been Rob Dew reporting from Appleton, Wisconsin, for InfoWars.com.
[00:47:03.004 --> 00:47:04.006]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.547 --> 00:47:06.831]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.112 --> 00:47:14.966]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:04.445 --> 00:49:09.067]  Well we all know that the president is afraid to utter the words Islamic terrorism.
[00:49:09.408 --> 00:49:18.993]  But now the White House has gone so far as to censor the French president when he dared to say that Islamist terrorism is at the roots of terrorism.
[00:49:19.793 --> 00:49:26.577]  We're also making sure that between Europe and the United States there can be a very high level coordination.
[00:49:27.978 --> 00:49:29.578]  But we're also aware that
[00:49:32.107 --> 00:49:34.600]  The roots of terrorism.
[00:49:37.383 --> 00:49:40.105]  But you can read the official White House transcript.
[00:49:40.125 --> 00:49:41.846]  You can see what he actually said.
[00:49:42.006 --> 00:49:44.348]  Why would they go so far as to censor it?
[00:49:44.428 --> 00:49:48.791]  Much like they want to censor anyone who would dare speak out against Islam.
[00:49:48.831 --> 00:49:55.455]  They want to curtail it in Islamophobia to try and tell you that you're racist or xenophobic if you dare speak out about it.
[00:49:55.875 --> 00:50:02.059]  But what's the president going to do now that we even have the Arab press starting to speak out?
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:07.103]  These are views being expressed by writers from Kuwait to Jordan to Saudi Arabia.
[00:50:07.603 --> 00:50:24.030]  And they are representing a brutal reckoning with the Arab and Islamic world's failure to create a single normal country, to accept the fact that all terrorists are Muslim, and its insistence that terror is simply the result of Western racism, colonialism, and marginalization.
[00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:27.732]  So this is in an article titled, We Have Failed Indeed.
[00:50:28.172 --> 00:50:31.794]  It's the editor of the London-based Saudi daily Al-Hayat.
[00:50:32.654 --> 00:50:41.022]  He attacked Arabs and Muslims for wreaking havoc in the same European countries that agreed to take them in after they fled their own failed states.
[00:50:41.542 --> 00:50:49.770]  He says, is our option for the other essentially that he will be either like us or we will blow him up so that his body parts mingle with ours?
[00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:55.476]  Who gave us the right to dictate to others the nature of their regimes, their values, and their lifestyle?
[00:50:56.036 --> 00:51:03.900]  Charbel continues by asserting that the Arab and Muslim world has failed to produce a single functioning state and a single normal citizen.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:11.403]  Meanwhile, Kuwaiti writer and author Khalil al-Hadar echoes similar sentiments in the Barani Daily.
[00:51:11.663 --> 00:51:13.424]  He blames Muslims for terrorism.
[00:51:14.284 --> 00:51:20.047]  All around the world and slams those who dismiss it by saying the terrorists don't represent true Islam.
[00:51:20.427 --> 00:51:33.312]  He says, is it normal that while terrorism succeeds in recruiting hundreds and even thousands of Muslims, we are satisfied to persuade ourselves that their numbers are still negligible compared to the global Muslim population?
[00:51:33.672 --> 00:51:41.316]  Must the number of terrorists swell to tens or hundreds of thousands before we realize that a thunderous pounding torrent is headed toward us?
[00:51:42.276 --> 00:51:45.700]  Unfortunately, the Muslims do not yet unanimously condemn ISIS.
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:56.091]  Some Muslims praise them, think the media wrongs them, and then joins them at the first opportunity to even carry out the first suicide mission they are offered anywhere in the world.
[00:51:57.765 --> 00:52:11.423]  He also adds that they must confront the fact that most terrorist attacks in the Arab and Muslim world itself are not carried out by Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Ahmadis, or Baha'is, but by Muslims and the sons and daughters of Muslims.
[00:52:12.765 --> 00:52:15.746]  Well we also have a female Muslim journalist from Qatar.
[00:52:16.226 --> 00:52:31.191]  She brought a new angle to the immigration debate recently when she reportedly wrote a column for a Kuwaiti newspaper arguing that Muslims have no right to criticize the GOP frontrunner Donald Trump over his proposal to temporarily halt Islamic immigration to the US.
[00:52:31.371 --> 00:52:41.054]  She said, it's strange that we believe we have the right to condemn such statements rather than address the implications of some of our extremist curricula, our education,
[00:52:41.434 --> 00:52:41.494]  I'm
[00:53:11.734 --> 00:53:17.719]  For years, without any fear or worry, Muslims have been able to travel to the West because of the West's tolerance.
[00:53:18.119 --> 00:53:22.502]  But this tolerance is slowly fading due to a very legitimate reason.
[00:53:22.862 --> 00:53:27.686]  The stubborn refusal by many Muslims to admit the radical nature of their religion.
[00:53:28.186 --> 00:53:30.588]  So this is just, whoa!
[00:53:30.788 --> 00:53:35.211]  I can't even believe what I'm seeing, but we're absolutely witnessing a turning of the tide.
[00:53:35.431 --> 00:53:37.453]  There was actually a female on Reddit who
[00:53:37.833 --> 00:53:42.417]  As a boy, I spent several years in Indonesia and heard the call of the Azan at the break of dawn.
[00:53:42.437 --> 00:53:46.721]  I have known Islam on three continents before coming to the region where it was first revealed.
[00:54:04.929 --> 00:54:06.913]  That experience guides my conviction.
[00:54:06.974 --> 00:54:10.261]  America is not and never will be at war with Islam.
[00:54:11.224 --> 00:54:18.970]  Once again, the Muslim disguised as our Commander-in-Chief has openly scoffed at the reality of our national security.
[00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:37.985]  MRCTV reports, the White House briefly pulled video of a press event on terrorism with President Obama, and when it reappeared on the WhiteHouse.gov website and YouTube, the audio of French President Hollande's translator goes silent, beginning with the words, Islamist terrorism.
[00:54:38.425 --> 00:54:41.409]  Then begins again at the end of his sentence.
[00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:49.360]  Even the audio of Alon saying the words Islamist terrorism in French have apparently been edited from the video.
[00:54:57.701 --> 00:55:00.582]  And this pattern has been repeating itself for years.
[00:55:01.182 --> 00:55:04.283]  I don't quibble with labels.
[00:55:04.884 --> 00:55:08.945]  Islam is not part of the problem in combating violent extremism.
[00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:11.466]  It is an important part of promoting peace.
[00:55:12.147 --> 00:55:14.828]  Is violent Islamist extremism at war with us?
[00:55:16.485 --> 00:55:16.925]  No, sir.
[00:55:17.125 --> 00:55:20.107]  We are being attacked by Al-Qaeda and its allies.
[00:55:20.207 --> 00:55:25.190]  Is Al-Qaeda, can it be described as being an exponent of violent Islamist extremism?
[00:55:26.671 --> 00:55:30.133]  Al-Qaeda are murderers with an ideological agenda.
[00:55:30.154 --> 00:55:31.074]  That wasn't my question.
[00:55:31.114 --> 00:55:38.178]  My question was, is Al-Qaeda acting out violent Islamist extremism?
[00:55:39.219 --> 00:55:40.480]  Al-Qaeda is
[00:55:40.982 --> 00:55:45.746]  A violent organization dedicated to overthrowing the values that we intend to advance.
[00:55:45.766 --> 00:55:46.486]  So is it yes or no?
[00:55:49.689 --> 00:55:50.809]  Can I hear the question again?
[00:55:52.531 --> 00:55:55.913]  Again, could one of these three individuals have been incited by radical Islam?
[00:55:56.193 --> 00:55:57.614]  Apparently you feel that they could have been.
[00:55:58.035 --> 00:56:02.818]  Well, I think potentially incited by two of Islam that is inconsistent with our existing religion.
[00:56:02.858 --> 00:56:05.200]  It's hard to get an answer yes or no.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:07.502]  They're unwilling to even mention a term.
[00:56:08.078 --> 00:56:15.790]  When all over the world this is happening, and it's going to start happening more and more here, because we're allowing so many in, is just incredible.
[00:56:16.277 --> 00:56:21.082]  Why is Islamic terrorism such a dirty phrase to the Obama administration?
[00:56:21.122 --> 00:56:28.990]  Intelligence officials in Pakistan say a local commander from the terrorist network Islamic State has admitted receiving funds transferred via the U.S.
[00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:31.052]  He made the confession while being interrogated.
[00:56:31.533 --> 00:56:38.380]  Today we learned that the same group may now be in possession of a deadly cache of American-made firepower, Stinger missiles.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.221]  I think it was a willful decision.
[00:56:40.541 --> 00:56:44.223]  A willful decision to support an insurgency that had Salafists, Al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:56:44.243 --> 00:56:46.344]  A willful decision to do what they're doing.
[00:56:46.584 --> 00:56:51.947]  Which you have to really ask the President, what is it that he actually is doing?
[00:56:52.228 --> 00:56:52.848]  It's simple.
[00:56:53.308 --> 00:56:57.911]  The Obama administration and the Muslim Brotherhood are one in the same.
[00:56:58.331 --> 00:57:10.156]  Back in June of 2015, The Washington Times reported that the policy of backing the Muslim Brotherhood is outlined in a secret directive called Presidential Study Directive 11, or PSD 11.
[00:57:10.776 --> 00:57:17.919]  The directive was produced in 2011 and outlines the administration's support for political reform, i.e.
