[00:00:22.296 --> 00:00:26.019]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.561]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:29.982]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:30.483 --> 00:00:36.227]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.493 --> 00:00:48.638]  There are tens of thousands of emails that hackers have released in the last three days
[00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:59.160]  Of the Democratic Party, of George Soros, and of other criminal organizations.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:11.063]  And you're only going to see more of those leaks coming out in the days and weeks to come in the 80 days that we've got out from the election.
[00:01:12.163 --> 00:01:12.804]  80 and change.
[00:01:12.844 --> 00:01:14.684]  In fact, how many days exactly is it?
[00:01:14.704 --> 00:01:15.224]  83 days.
[00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:22.777]  And notice what's in the George Soros emails.
[00:01:23.018 --> 00:01:25.261]  Thousands and thousands and thousands of them.
[00:01:26.277 --> 00:01:27.798]  That folks are digging through.
[00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:34.121]  Global government open up Europe, condition everyone in Europe and the U.S.
[00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:50.028]  to accept collapsing borders, and then bring in the groups and organize them and basically skim money off the top of the welfare they're given to siphon it back into the big foundations and back into the criminal combines.
[00:01:51.308 --> 00:01:52.769]  Where did I hear this before?
[00:01:55.123 --> 00:01:59.424]  In my documentary films, on the radio, and in the stories at Infowars.com.
[00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:02.785]  Because we don't need these emails to know this.
[00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:09.746]  It is on record that this is their plan at the United Nations.
[00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:13.707]  It's just interesting to see Soros directing it from behind the scenes.
[00:02:14.128 --> 00:02:18.208]  The video that we shot on Saturday is titled, Shocker.
[00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:22.169]  UN admits migrant crisis plan to overthrow the West.
[00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.170]  And in their own words,
[00:02:25.984 --> 00:02:28.546]  They say, basically, get rid of white people.
[00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:39.934]  Now, they're selling this to the 90 plus percent of the planet that isn't white, and most of which happen to be third world, that this is a reverse colonialism conquering the West.
[00:02:41.815 --> 00:02:44.917]  The third world populations are being used as cannon fodder.
[00:02:45.558 --> 00:02:50.801]  Remember the global government tree that was leaked in 2008, the Copenhagen text?
[00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:52.723]  And what did it say?
[00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:56.799]  That they were going to right at double.
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.320]  It was right below doubling.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.821]  One point below doubling the taxes on the third world that the West would pay.
[00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:18.324]  The third world has been looted and robbed by the mega corporations that don't operate in free market but operate as combines since the days of the British East India and Dutch East India Company.
[00:03:18.984 --> 00:03:21.805]  And it's that model that is the planetary government we now face.
[00:03:26.274 --> 00:03:36.043]  And we have George Soros that never saw a scam he didn't love, who's overthrown scores of countries, devalued their currencies in the West and in the third world.
[00:03:37.504 --> 00:03:40.707]  And now you have Daily Caller and others digging through the emails.
[00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:42.829]  Top story on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:44.730]  Kingdom of Soros.
[00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.253]  Influence world with refugee crisis.
[00:03:48.013 --> 00:03:49.535]  Cash for social justice.
[00:03:52.099 --> 00:04:05.263]  And they admit that, first they tell you it's 100,000, it's really a million, then they tell you it's 2 million, it's 5 million, and that they're going to flood everybody with these folks and then restrict our free speech through social media and ban our speech and not let us criticize it.
[00:04:05.463 --> 00:04:06.744]  We already saw that happen in Europe.
[00:04:07.024 --> 00:04:10.005]  I called it before Germany and France declared civil emergencies.
[00:04:11.405 --> 00:04:13.986]  And again, I'm not up here bragging, I called it, I called it, I called it.
[00:04:14.346 --> 00:04:15.667]  We know the enemy program.
[00:04:17.577 --> 00:04:19.738]  And we have to organize against it and expose it.
[00:04:19.798 --> 00:04:34.884]  It is the mega-offshore rich, diplomatically immune, above the law, tax-exempt, organizing the desperate third world to bring down what's left of independent wealth, the globalist of control, because they implement.
[00:04:35.784 --> 00:04:38.065]  It's like you see a cop car and it says tax-exempt.
[00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:55.468]  The cop themselves isn't a bad person, but that idea that the state is tax-exempt and can give state powers to private corporations, making themselves exempt, they then organize higher taxes on everybody else, bring in third-world populations to be their enforcers, and it's game over.
[00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:01.435]  By the way, that's actually in the documents as well, how they're going to use the illegals as the new constabulary.
[00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.316]  That means the enforcers.
[00:05:03.777 --> 00:05:06.559]  But first they have to remove the old constabulary.
[00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.980]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.101]  This is the program to defeat globalism.
[00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:16.626]  Let's talk about Amerigeddon which is available at Infowarsstore.com exclusively right now for the next week or so.
[00:05:16.926 --> 00:05:19.408]  You get two copies and you get two free films with it.
[00:05:19.548 --> 00:05:22.029]  Yeah, and this is an important movie because it's fact-based.
[00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.293]  We tell a story about an EMP attack, an electromagnetic pulse attack on America, that shuts down the grid.
[00:05:29.853 --> 00:05:36.257]  And our Congress has warned that if this were to happen, 90% of the American population would die in 12 months.
[00:05:37.377 --> 00:05:42.021]  To quote Henry Kissinger, the only thing standing in the way of a new world order is a strong America.
[00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:50.587]  One of the ways that they can diminish America quickly and severely is to allow for an EMP attack on this country.
[00:05:51.107 --> 00:05:56.871]  And in light of the events and things that are happening, I'm afraid this is a very likely scenario.
[00:05:56.931 --> 00:05:57.972]  So I made a movie about it.
[00:05:57.992 --> 00:06:00.414]  It's an entertaining movie, but it's fact-based.
[00:06:00.954 --> 00:06:07.176]  People are getting the director's cut that is even bigger than what you see in theaters, and so this is the first look director's cut.
[00:06:07.196 --> 00:06:16.958]  You know, Hollywood has tried to diminish the final edit on this thing, but what Alex has available here at his website this week is everything.
[00:06:17.098 --> 00:06:18.078]  The most hardcore version.
[00:06:18.298 --> 00:06:18.458]  Yep.
[00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:24.860]  So this is a great place to acquire the movie and then to show it to your friends and family and even your churches.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:46.498]  That's right, you can get one copy of the film Amerigeddon on DVD at Infowarsstore.com exclusively right now, or get a second copy, two copies for $39.90 and get my first film, America Destroyed by Design, and then one of my latest, most powerful films, Fall of the Republic, that breaks down everything currently happening, free.
[00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:52.083]  Two films free when you purchase two Amerigeddons, and I'm doing that because I want
[00:06:52.563 --> 00:06:54.124]  to get this film out.
[00:06:54.404 --> 00:07:01.988]  Another big thing people can do if you really want to reach a lot of people, get two copies, keep one for your own archive to share, take the other and donate it to the library.
[00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:06.070]  So many people are smart because they've closed all the video stores.
[00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:17.255]  I was reading an article about this in the Wall Street Journal about a year ago, that what's the most popular now at libraries is not the books anymore, but is people going and actually checking out the DVDs, the Blu-rays, all that.
[00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:20.557]  And so that's why you make a donation of this to your library.
[00:07:21.317 --> 00:07:26.179]  You're going to talk about hundreds of people that are going to check that out and watch it.
[00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:28.600]  That is amazing.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.480]  All of that.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:45.346]  I can't tell you how many listeners we run into on the street that found this show, not on a local M or FM station, but over the internet over the years, that somebody gave them a DVD or somebody gave them a card with forbidden information, InfoWars.com, or they saw a bumper sticker, and it's just exponential.
[00:07:45.446 --> 00:07:46.006]  It's exponential.
[00:07:46.486 --> 00:07:50.408]  I can't imagine where InfoWars will be in a year, two years, three years.
[00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:55.614]  And I just pray to God that I can be humble and focus and make the right decisions with this great responsibility.
[00:07:55.634 --> 00:07:56.915]  But it's not just Alex Jones.
[00:07:57.196 --> 00:07:58.077]  It's what Gary Haven's doing.
[00:07:58.097 --> 00:07:58.998]  It's what Matt Drudge is doing.
[00:07:59.018 --> 00:08:00.039]  It's what WorldNetDaily is doing.
[00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:03.663]  It's what people like Donald Trump are doing.
[00:08:04.064 --> 00:08:07.468]  We all are just choosing to not be with the new world order.
[00:08:17.026 --> 00:08:22.631]  As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point.
[00:08:23.431 --> 00:08:38.824]  Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest reproduced in greater numbers than the rest, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits.
[00:08:39.965 --> 00:08:46.029]  Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent.
[00:08:46.529 --> 00:08:50.872]  But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction.
[00:08:51.393 --> 00:08:52.253]  A dumbing down.
[00:08:52.894 --> 00:08:59.058]  Harvard researchers have found children who live in high fluoride areas have significantly lower IQs.
[00:08:59.778 --> 00:09:07.020]  It was just a few thousand years ago that our ancestors were using primitive breaths to communicate.
[00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:24.767]  Hillary's a good leader.
[00:09:24.927 --> 00:09:25.928]  I trust Hillary.
[00:09:26.368 --> 00:09:29.290]  Hillary is a good leader.
[00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.311]  I stand here as a freed slave.
[00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:32.371]  You are so dumb.
[00:09:32.812 --> 00:09:33.992]  You are really dumb.
[00:09:34.333 --> 00:09:34.913]  For real.
[00:09:36.494 --> 00:09:40.356]  Mankind became stupider at a frightening rate.
[00:09:40.416 --> 00:09:43.818]  You're a white man!
[00:09:43.858 --> 00:09:45.999]  You wanna know what I found out?
[00:09:46.199 --> 00:09:49.361]  Most of England speaks American-ish.
[00:09:49.701 --> 00:09:51.763]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[00:09:53.473 --> 00:09:55.074]  You've come too far!
[00:09:55.094 --> 00:10:07.564]  I believe that our education, like such as South Africa and Iraq, everywhere like such as, and I believe that they should, our education over here in the U.S.
[00:10:07.604 --> 00:10:10.446]  should help the U.S., should help South Africa.
[00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:11.366]  What does that mean?
[00:10:11.467 --> 00:10:17.431]  Mercury-containing vacuums may help not warm kids, according to two new studies in the Journal of Pediatrics.
[00:10:27.185 --> 00:10:34.749]  We now go live to violence channel correspondent for Micah Davis at the extreme court with highlights on today's trial.
[00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:40.613]  Good to see you in this exercise in transparency and democracy.
[00:10:41.313 --> 00:10:45.636]  Is that what it is?
[00:10:57.114 --> 00:11:04.296]  A great dust bowl had ravaged food supplies, and the number one movie in the country was called Ass.
[00:11:04.716 --> 00:11:09.198]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory, that's ridiculous.
[00:11:09.218 --> 00:11:10.618]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:11:11.018 --> 00:11:13.139]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:14.019]  What does that mean?
[00:11:14.359 --> 00:11:17.380]  Obama, you should run for a third term because we need you.
[00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:19.161]  Obama, third term!
[00:11:19.481 --> 00:11:21.182]  How many sides does a triangle have?
[00:11:23.342 --> 00:11:24.123]  Damn, four.
[00:11:24.543 --> 00:11:25.383]  There's no sides.
[00:11:29.557 --> 00:11:31.898]  What's Osama Bin Laden most infamous for?
[00:11:32.198 --> 00:11:32.738]  Osama?
[00:11:32.898 --> 00:11:33.239]  Yeah.
[00:11:33.499 --> 00:11:34.079]  Or Obama?
[00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:34.919]  Osama.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.040]  I have no idea who Osama is.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.701]  Which state does KFC come from?
[00:11:41.482 --> 00:11:41.982]  What, the chicken?
[00:11:44.682 --> 00:11:45.522]  I don't know.
[00:11:45.542 --> 00:11:46.183]  I really don't know.
[00:11:46.383 --> 00:11:47.763]  Okay, do you know what KFC stands for?
[00:11:47.803 --> 00:11:49.584]  Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[00:11:49.844 --> 00:12:01.047]  A little further south from that facility, there's a completely separate building where they, get this, change raw sewage water into water people drink.
[00:12:01.227 --> 00:12:01.487]  Why?
[00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:03.228]  They got the toilet?
[00:12:03.448 --> 00:12:05.189]  But Brondo's got what plants crave.
[00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:06.349]  It's got electromagnetism.
[00:12:07.302 --> 00:12:13.586]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:12:14.106 --> 00:12:22.932]  It's a circus, everybody!
[00:12:23.032 --> 00:12:23.332]  Look!
[00:12:23.432 --> 00:12:24.813]  Look at the monkey!
[00:12:24.873 --> 00:12:26.053]  Look at the monkey!
[00:12:26.093 --> 00:12:29.095]  I did that on purpose!
[00:12:30.476 --> 00:12:36.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have to have a little bit of fun with the decline of civilization.
[00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.173]  We have to have some gallows humor, but this is going to be an incredible transmission today.
[00:12:42.273 --> 00:12:57.705]  Particularly, we had a major Stanford Research Institute study confirming Democratic election fraud on a massive scale to steal the election from Bernie Sanders.
[00:12:57.745 --> 00:12:59.126]  Now, I know you already know that.
[00:12:59.186 --> 00:13:00.928]  I know we chronicled that here on air.
[00:13:01.768 --> 00:13:03.710]  And the Republicans tried the same thing with
[00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:08.641]  Donald Trump, but because he fought back, they failed.
[00:13:09.181 --> 00:13:12.623]  And that is a lesson to us on every front about fighting back.
[00:13:12.643 --> 00:13:15.085]  But that is the big news today.
[00:13:17.806 --> 00:13:19.908]  And it's in even places like U.S.
[00:13:19.968 --> 00:13:21.168]  News and World Report.
[00:13:21.549 --> 00:13:22.969]  It's even in the Associated Press.
[00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.690]  Here's another headline.
[00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:27.532]  Can the 2016 election be rigged?
[00:13:27.712 --> 00:13:28.193]  You bet.
[00:13:29.073 --> 00:13:30.474]  That's out of the Hill newspaper.
[00:13:32.435 --> 00:13:35.277]  Meanwhile, Debbie Washam and Schultz has come out and admitted
[00:13:37.346 --> 00:13:38.447]  This came out a few days ago.
[00:13:38.607 --> 00:13:47.176]  She said it on tape, but now it's getting some traction that she was there in the Democratic National Committee to make sure Hillary got the nomination.
[00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:55.504]  Now, of course, she's denied this previously, but this is like CNN coming out and saying, you know, we're doing everything we can to get Hillary elected.
[00:13:55.724 --> 00:13:57.405]  Everybody's like, wow, they admit it.
[00:13:57.566 --> 00:13:58.487]  They admit it.
[00:13:58.507 --> 00:14:00.669]  I was watching Fox News this weekend.
[00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:05.611]  And they said, coming up, is there bias in the media against Donald Trump?
[00:14:05.931 --> 00:14:15.117]  So I sat there and I waited till they finally got to that piece and they weren't sure.
[00:14:15.137 --> 00:14:18.699]  They weren't sure on Fox News if there was bias.
[00:14:19.099 --> 00:14:20.120]  They weren't sure.
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:25.283]  This is the level of idiocy and how stupid
[00:14:26.311 --> 00:14:29.433]  They think we are, so we're going to be getting to all of that today.
[00:14:30.013 --> 00:14:35.055]  But they stole the election from the Bernie Sanders voters, and that's a fact.
[00:14:35.595 --> 00:14:55.305]  And they could have Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes and everybody sit up there and make jokes and sit up there and edit together videos of things I've said in the last 20 years, try to make us look silly, but we have been pushing, more than anybody else but Drudge, the narrative that we should have free and open elections.
[00:14:56.673 --> 00:15:16.848]  And if you want to say we're bad people because of that, please throw me in that briar patch because I'm very proud of the fact that we've been exposing it, we've had a huge effect stopping it, in the case of Trump, and we are continuing to force that narrative out there and have been proven right by the Stanford Research Institute and other major studies.
[00:15:20.652 --> 00:15:22.514]  It is a fact that this is going on.
[00:15:24.336 --> 00:15:29.762]  It is a fact that having poll watchers and exposing this may make them be forced to back down.
[00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:32.725]  So we're not going down without a fight here.
[00:15:33.646 --> 00:15:35.548]  Now, let me tell you what else is coming up.
[00:15:37.261 --> 00:15:39.902]  We've talked about this some of the last month, but now it's confirmed.
[00:15:40.942 --> 00:15:41.283]  U.S.
[00:15:41.363 --> 00:15:44.984]  nukes in Turkey vulnerable to terrorists and other hostile forces, think tank.
[00:15:45.564 --> 00:15:47.565]  And that means basically Ergun capturing them.
[00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:49.266]  That's code for that.
[00:15:49.686 --> 00:15:50.386]  That's our team.
[00:15:51.086 --> 00:15:52.307]  This is AP.
[00:15:52.647 --> 00:15:56.588]  China's launch of quantum satellite, major step in space race.
[00:15:58.229 --> 00:16:02.751]  Military first for Iran as Russian bombers based on its territory launch airstrikes on Syria.
[00:16:04.471 --> 00:16:06.932]  Scientists built a mini black hole out of sound waves.
[00:16:08.253 --> 00:16:09.614]  Burned down white suburbs.
[00:16:09.654 --> 00:16:10.894]  There's new developments there.
[00:16:10.914 --> 00:16:13.456]  Brexit unlikely before 2019.
[00:16:15.017 --> 00:16:18.258]  Flight attendants caught on video spraying pesticide on passengers.
[00:16:18.859 --> 00:16:21.080]  Investigations reveal routine practice.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:27.003]  In fact, we've had crew members that have been on planes recently with their spraying pesticides saying, it's not harmful, don't worry.
[00:16:30.665 --> 00:16:31.946]  Fluoride's not harmful either.
[00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:35.202]  Neither is a hatchet upside the head.
[00:16:36.742 --> 00:16:54.106]  Speaking of hatchets upside the head, France and other countries are having to shut down large stretches of road because the migrant invaders that resemble a zombie horde of military-age men are killing people with hatchets and hammers and robbing their cars en masse.
[00:16:54.646 --> 00:17:01.248]  Total Bedlam is descending into those countries by design, and now they're developing a national police force
[00:17:02.108 --> 00:17:13.073]  For each of those countries, from Sweden to Germany to France, and they admit that they are linking up with Muslim leaders online to arrest anyone criticizing Islam in any way.
[00:17:13.093 --> 00:17:16.715]  The London mayor has also announced an initiative to arrest you and your family.
[00:17:18.276 --> 00:17:20.617]  Now, we have this from the new George Soros emails.
[00:17:20.797 --> 00:17:22.538]  Now, I told you this was the battle plan.
[00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:25.580]  In fact, Saturday we shot a video
[00:17:26.833 --> 00:17:38.116]  Showing public statements from the UN lead envoy who heads up the migration program and immigration program, the migrant program.
[00:17:39.417 --> 00:17:47.719]  And we broke all of this down with the headline, UN admits, shocker, UN admits migrant crisis plan to overthrow the West.
[00:17:47.739 --> 00:17:50.880]  And we're going to post this Daily Caller article on InfoWars.com
[00:17:52.179 --> 00:18:00.864]  Where now we have all the emails double-proving this, we're just gonna under it put my video from Saturday that I came up here and shot, just exposing this.
[00:18:01.204 --> 00:18:10.469]  But now we just don't have it from Peter Sutherland, and of course in the video I finger Soros and explain that he funded the Arab Spring, the Ukraine overthrow, what's happening here.
[00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:12.910]  This is really happening.
[00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:18.593]  But let's just go over the stack of news today on this subject alone.
[00:18:19.597 --> 00:18:44.913]  Mega banks, above the law, tax exempt, diplomatic immunity, going in with education programs to create absolute, total, homicidal hatred of anyone with white skin, and teaching them to hate capitalism, and teaching them that you must go to the United States or Europe or Australia, and you must capture it politically as leftists, and that you must then take over government and create a utopia.
[00:18:45.902 --> 00:19:07.115]  Now this is taught in Mexico, this is taught in Nigeria, this is taught in Sudan, this is taught in South Africa, this is taught all over places like Venezuela, Nicaragua, El Salvador, they're all running programs as of this year, officially organized with the UN to bring in people from all over the world
[00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:08.965]  I don't know.
[00:19:30.891 --> 00:19:36.873]  And then large portions of that money is skimmed and given back to the organized crime combine.
[00:19:37.654 --> 00:19:40.955]  You saw shadows of this, tracings of this.
[00:19:40.975 --> 00:19:42.416]  We're going to skip the network break.
[00:19:42.436 --> 00:19:43.016]  It's too important.
[00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:44.156]  I mean, I'm serious.
[00:19:44.176 --> 00:19:47.117]  This is just the end of the country, the end of the world we're talking about here.
[00:19:47.137 --> 00:19:51.419]  And the Border Patrol even comes out and says, we've been ordered to complete the smuggling process.
[00:19:52.239 --> 00:19:53.820]  That's how mega massive all this is.
[00:19:55.541 --> 00:19:56.321]  So let's continue.
[00:19:57.998 --> 00:20:00.899]  Hillary's VP, we have the video of this coming up.
[00:20:01.839 --> 00:20:06.981]  Hillary's VP, whites must become a minority to atone for racism.
[00:20:08.301 --> 00:20:11.082]  Now again, this is the ultimate racism.
[00:20:11.822 --> 00:20:18.144]  To experience what other people have gone through, because only whites have oppressed anybody in history, total lie.
[00:20:19.369 --> 00:20:23.970]  We must make whites a minority so they can be persecuted, is what he's saying.
[00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:35.614]  And this is a white guy who's going to lead this and organize all the different racial groups, who they're going to put your kids in prison and teach them in the prison, how according to different racial groups, how to kill each other.
[00:20:35.794 --> 00:20:42.456]  He's going to manage you, but he's selling it to you, the party of the KKK, as your new time to shine.
[00:20:44.568 --> 00:20:45.470]  This is incredible.
[00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:53.684]  In fact, let's just play the clip of the man that would be the vice president, probably the president when Hillary, uh, uh, you know, that brain tumor goes out and eats the rest of that melon.
[00:20:53.704 --> 00:20:54.024]  Here it is.
[00:20:54.924 --> 00:20:59.086]  The most segregated hour of the week is 11 o'clock Sunday morning, and that was a challenge to me.
[00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:04.168]  And so I've made my spiritual home in a neighborhood where we're not segregated.
[00:21:04.228 --> 00:21:08.951]  In fact, we were, when we started there, one of a few white families in that church.
[00:21:09.031 --> 00:21:18.175]  It's now a very well-integrated church, but it was important to, especially I think the burden is on those of us who are in a majority, you know, Caucasians here.
[00:21:19.095 --> 00:21:21.577]  We got to put ourselves in situations where we're in the minority.
[00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:30.115]  Okay, so there are, the world is officially 90% non-Anglo.
[00:21:30.936 --> 00:21:39.782]  And then if you look at the numbers, there's about 3% of that are people that are identifying as Anglo that you could argue aren't.
[00:21:39.802 --> 00:21:41.724]  7% of the planet is Anglo.
[00:21:42.404 --> 00:21:42.645]  Okay?
[00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:47.496]  But you would think it is the end of the world that white people even exist.
[00:21:48.237 --> 00:21:57.885]  So I apologize for Europe and I apologize for the printing press and I apologize for the science and the medicine and everything else and I just am here to say this guy's absolutely right.
[00:21:57.925 --> 00:22:00.066]  No, this is a sick, evil race pimp.
[00:22:00.787 --> 00:22:09.174]  With George Soros in there funding absolute racial division and racial programs to create hatred between different groups of people.
[00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:10.302]  I think?
[00:22:27.898 --> 00:22:29.379]  And they decide how to game the system.
[00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:30.759]  That's all declassified.
[00:22:30.939 --> 00:22:31.799]  That's all admitted.
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:32.900]  It's not my opinion.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.340]  It's an absolute total fact.
[00:22:34.641 --> 00:22:43.904]  And now we have more emails from the hack inside of the Soros Foundation with them breaking down what they're doing.
[00:22:43.924 --> 00:22:45.445]  And they don't even use code words, okay?
[00:22:46.945 --> 00:22:51.307]  UN migration envoy believes EU should undermine national homogeneity.
[00:22:51.607 --> 00:22:52.987]  Goes on to say Europe is white.
[00:22:53.067 --> 00:22:53.988]  That must be stopped.
[00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:59.499]  That is the former founder of the EU, Peter Sutherland, top globalist.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.381]  That is, again, BBC, you name it.
[00:23:03.722 --> 00:23:04.963]  Here's the latest, Daily Caller.
[00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:09.687]  Leaked Soros memo, refugee crisis, quote, new normal.
[00:23:09.988 --> 00:23:13.471]  See, it's meant to just totally open the border, merge with the Middle East, North Africa.
[00:23:13.871 --> 00:23:16.793]  Gives new opportunities for global influence.
[00:23:17.554 --> 00:23:21.978]  And he goes in to talk about skimming money off the people once they go into the social safety net.
[00:23:22.538 --> 00:23:28.540]  Organizing them as a political detonator group that is under the control of the leftist combines.
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:34.662]  I know you've already heard this every day for years here, but just here it is, exactly as I told you, the exact plan.
[00:23:36.723 --> 00:23:37.763]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:23:38.063 --> 00:23:41.285]  Soros hack reveals plot behind Europe's refugee crisis.
[00:23:41.725 --> 00:23:45.086]  Manipulation, cash for social justice.
[00:23:46.428 --> 00:23:47.229]  Call in the groups.
[00:23:48.209 --> 00:23:48.950]  Keep them poor.
[00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.150]  Keep them under your control.
[00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:51.131]  Get them on welfare.
[00:23:51.611 --> 00:23:52.212]  Detonate!
[00:23:52.492 --> 00:23:53.152]  Burn cities!
[00:23:54.181 --> 00:23:57.082]  And then start banning people's free speech to criticize your own program.
[00:23:57.442 --> 00:23:58.542]  Advertise Europe's Open.
[00:23:58.642 --> 00:24:00.263]  Advertise all the free goodies are there.
[00:24:00.743 --> 00:24:01.543]  We're getting to that next.
[00:24:01.864 --> 00:24:02.604]  Get ready for it.
[00:24:02.944 --> 00:24:03.324]  Boom!
[00:24:03.884 --> 00:24:07.445]  London mayor to set up police online hate crime hub.
[00:24:07.805 --> 00:24:08.866]  This guy is a Muslim.
[00:24:09.346 --> 00:24:10.786]  He admits he wants Sharia law.
[00:24:11.787 --> 00:24:16.148]  He says he will not follow the Brexit and will make London an Islamic state, basically.
[00:24:16.408 --> 00:24:21.170]  They are banning images of women in bathing suits on city-owned property billboards and buses.
[00:24:22.008 --> 00:24:23.469]  Hitting and hitting hard.
[00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:26.971]  They're putting Muslim police chiefs in almost everywhere.
[00:24:27.051 --> 00:24:30.612]  I mean, it is on, and the reign of terror is on.
[00:24:31.133 --> 00:24:34.674]  Again, it's not a Muslim takeover, per se, in this phase.
[00:24:34.755 --> 00:24:41.378]  It's that they will enforce, they understand political power and the will to control, and to be brought in as a client state to do it.
[00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:51.751]  You ought to read what the Sikhs are saying about this, the poor Sikhs that have been battling Muslims for over a thousand years out of India.
[00:24:52.511 --> 00:24:59.553]  And they're the poor ones that when some idiot moron goes in and sees people with turbans, you know, they'll go do a mass shooting occasionally of the poor Sikhs.
[00:25:00.233 --> 00:25:03.694]  The Sikhs are out there warning people, this is what the Muslims did in India.
[00:25:03.774 --> 00:25:04.674]  You better watch out.
[00:25:04.934 --> 00:25:06.414]  They're going to end up being your police chiefs.
[00:25:06.694 --> 00:25:07.795]  And it's already happened.
[00:25:07.935 --> 00:25:08.775]  It's a total plan.
[00:25:09.115 --> 00:25:12.876]  We're totally sold out, folks, with a weirdo Nazi collaborator running it.
[00:25:13.376 --> 00:25:14.216]  Now, listen to this.
[00:25:15.345 --> 00:25:21.330]  London mayor to set up police online hate crime hub in partnership with social media firms.
[00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.994]  Already in Germany, they're arresting people and Facebook has hired the former Stasi to run it.
[00:25:26.174 --> 00:25:26.935]  Then they call the police.
[00:25:26.975 --> 00:25:30.037]  You get arrested for criticizing open borders in any way.
[00:25:30.698 --> 00:25:31.719]  Now it started in London.
[00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:34.061]  In fact, Paul's gonna have to move here because of it.
[00:25:34.721 --> 00:25:38.164]  The office of the London's, he's already been threatened, already had phone calls.
[00:25:38.184 --> 00:25:39.105]  I mean, it's already gone.
[00:25:39.895 --> 00:25:52.206]  The office of London's first Muslim mayor, so he isn't wasting time, has secured millions of pounds to fund a police online hate crime hub to work in partnership with social justice media providers to criminalize trolls who target individuals and communities.
[00:25:57.688 --> 00:25:58.288]  Here's another one.
[00:25:59.049 --> 00:26:02.991]  Locals warned to stay away from main roads as migrants smash vehicles.
[00:26:03.851 --> 00:26:11.275]  Migrants wielding bats and knives have been smashing up vehicles on roads in Calais as the owners sit in traffic, reportedly just for fun.
[00:26:11.715 --> 00:26:19.559]  Local residents are warning others to avoid the area, saying that the migrants are not even checking to see whether children are in the vehicles because they set upon them.
[00:26:20.239 --> 00:26:21.320]  Well, it's not Islamic, though.
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:21.700]  It's okay.
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.662]  If they, you know, run over kids with a truck, it's not Islamic.
[00:26:24.122 --> 00:26:37.494]  One resident has posted pictures on Facebook of their brother-in-law's car, which sustained more than 500 pounds worth of damage, as a dozen migrants, meaning illegal alien invaders, shed about them with bats, completely smashing the side mirror and rear window.
[00:26:38.495 --> 00:26:42.378]  You're leaving work, and then you're attacked by migrants just for fun.
[00:26:42.438 --> 00:26:43.099]  It disgusts me.
[00:26:44.508 --> 00:26:50.274]  said Mava Mila in a post which has been shared more than 6,000 people.
[00:26:50.294 --> 00:26:54.018]  Yeah, France has declared and other places civil emergencies.
[00:26:54.038 --> 00:26:55.099]  I mean, we've shown you the videos.
[00:26:55.119 --> 00:27:03.467]  There's thousands of them on YouTube of just burning trucks, mobs of people dragging families out of vehicles, stabbings, murders, hatchet attacks.
[00:27:03.527 --> 00:27:05.149]  It's all just an orgy of enjoyment.
[00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:15.158]  And again, Hillary's up there with Mateen's father, the mass shooter at the nightclub, right behind her, at the VIP area, letting everybody know, this is it.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:23.146]  Merkel goes to the refugee centers, it's all men, all men, and says, we love you, we're sorry, we're here to help you.
[00:27:24.647 --> 00:27:26.629]  As France extends its state of emergency.
[00:27:29.278 --> 00:27:31.041]  So we've got that report, but it's okay.
[00:27:31.522 --> 00:27:40.657]  Oregon State forced social justice training on freshmen to make sure you learn to submit to all of this and learn how to be beat up.
[00:27:41.704 --> 00:27:54.692]  Like in San Francisco State College there, where you've got the little trendy white kid in, you know, I guess with dreadlocks and stuff, and the two trendies come over and beat him up because he's expropriating culture.
[00:27:54.732 --> 00:27:57.514]  See, there's no way to submit to this.
[00:27:58.355 --> 00:28:09.782]  You can organize any culture, whether it's Catholic against Orthodox, or Hutus against Tootsie Black African tribes, because one lives on the other side of the river, or
[00:28:12.486 --> 00:28:15.387]  Hispanic against white or white against black.
[00:28:15.687 --> 00:28:18.848]  You can organize this crap any way you want and that's what they've done.
[00:28:18.868 --> 00:28:19.849]  They're organizing it.
[00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.889]  They're launching it.
[00:28:21.349 --> 00:28:23.690]  Oregon State enforced social justice training on freshmen.
[00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:25.431]  Now everyone must go.
[00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:31.013]  Oregon State University is developing an online course centered on social justice that new students will soon be required to take.
[00:28:31.093 --> 00:28:33.093]  This is how you control civilization.
[00:28:33.313 --> 00:28:34.774]  This is how you roll in the robots.
[00:28:35.947 --> 00:28:44.311]  This is how you roll in the total surveillance, it's how you roll in the GMO, how you assault all of humanity, replacing their jobs, building a world where humans are obsolete.
[00:28:45.851 --> 00:28:51.254]  Is you first teach everyone to fight with each other, and you break up the family, and you divide culture.
[00:28:52.054 --> 00:28:55.475]  US accepts more Syrian refugees than all of the EU.

[00:29:21.233 --> 00:29:23.195]  My goodness, isn't that just special?
[00:29:24.697 --> 00:29:25.558]  Now when we come back,
[00:29:26.653 --> 00:29:28.694]  I'm going to drill into what I already mentioned in more detail.
[00:29:29.034 --> 00:29:31.615]  Stanford University confirms Democratic election fraud.
[00:29:32.035 --> 00:29:32.376]  Boom!

[00:29:35.097 --> 00:29:35.937]  Boom!
[00:29:36.657 --> 00:29:48.323]  And then we're going to get into the latest on what's happening with globalization and more on the Soros emails as Obama and the Soros-funded groups hit the Midwest telling them, Globalism!

[00:29:57.369 --> 00:29:58.830]  We'll be back on Alex Jones!
[00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:00.432]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.933 --> 00:30:02.515]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.661]  Article from the Associated Press.
[00:30:12.921 --> 00:30:21.167]  A Chicago-based communist revolutionary group was blamed by Milwaukee's police chief for stoking a second day of violence.
[00:30:21.647 --> 00:30:30.533]  Police Chief Ed Flynn said members of a Chicago chapter of the revolutionary communist party turned what had been a peaceful night into a tense one.
[00:30:31.013 --> 00:30:35.396]  TV footage showed a small group of protesters walking or running through the streets.
[00:30:35.636 --> 00:30:49.685]  The fatal police shooting of a 23-year-old black man, Savelle Smith, touched off a weekend of tense and at times violent protests that left at least six businesses burned and several officers injured by flying objects Saturday night.
[00:30:49.905 --> 00:30:55.849]  Fourteen people were arrested overnight and three police officers and four sheriff's deputies were injured.
[00:30:56.229 --> 00:31:01.653]  That group released a statement later referring to the protests as, quote, righteous rebellion.
[00:31:01.813 --> 00:31:03.134]  This is Ashley Beckford.

[00:31:09.918 --> 00:31:19.004]  If you can't see the irony in having a gun ban enforced by men with guns, well then you fail to understand why the Second Amendment was written in the first place.
[00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:21.885]  Throughout history, only slaves are disarmed.
[00:31:22.006 --> 00:31:25.748]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[00:31:25.888 --> 00:31:26.989]  The right of the people.
[00:31:27.009 --> 00:31:28.210]  The right of the people.
[00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:29.191]  The right of the people.
[00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:31.712]  To keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:31:31.772 --> 00:31:40.679]  For all of you actors out there who go to your red carpet events, surrounded by full battle rattle swat teams, while you accept your award for your latest violent movie.
[00:31:41.019 --> 00:31:52.308]  For all you politicians who spend your 9-5 days scheming up ways to take away my second amendment rights, meanwhile you have first responders on site there to protect you, I say this, come and take it.
[00:31:52.488 --> 00:31:54.870]  I have a strict gun control policy.
[00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:58.032]  If there's a gun around, I want to control it.

[00:32:02.215 --> 00:32:07.178]  Dads demand guns because it's me that's got to get up and go check out that noise at 2am.

[00:33:30.451 --> 00:33:31.592]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:31.672 --> 00:33:35.035]  Live, from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.415 --> 00:33:36.736]  It's close to midnight.
[00:33:37.116 --> 00:33:40.219]  Something evil's lurking from the dark.
[00:33:40.259 --> 00:33:41.920]  I've got the moonlight.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:48.025]  It's really a sight that'll almost stop your heart.
[00:33:48.165 --> 00:33:50.086]  You try to scream.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.701]  Monday through Friday ladies and gentlemen, we are here live from 11 a.m.
[00:34:09.121 --> 00:34:09.561]  to 3 p.m.
[00:34:09.581 --> 00:34:09.902]  Central.
[00:34:09.962 --> 00:34:10.962]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:34:12.783 --> 00:34:22.086]  We are watching organized private corporate world government use weaponized collapsing third world populations.
[00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:37.032]  Who they fill full of a political operating system of kill the West, destroy Whitey, while the elite sit back in their armored fortresses and watch society collapse and so they can then consolidate control.
[00:34:38.533 --> 00:34:41.673]  They are putting Europe into a collapse paradigm.
[00:34:43.494 --> 00:34:46.435]  And they're putting the rest of the world into that collapse paradigm as well.
[00:34:46.575 --> 00:34:47.635]  It is incredible.
[00:34:48.646 --> 00:34:52.708]  The good news is the military and the police know what's happening.
[00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:55.069]  The intelligentsia knows what's happening.
[00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:59.472]  And people in third world countries and old world countries know what's happening.
[00:34:59.832 --> 00:35:02.673]  And that's why you see the whole world against Soros now.
[00:35:03.254 --> 00:35:06.395]  And that means his minions, Hillary Clinton and others.
[00:35:07.416 --> 00:35:08.957]  You see the whole world
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:19.504]  All these different groups, leaks from inside the Pentagon, leaks from inside the Secret Service, exposing these monsters as humanity awakens.
[00:35:21.225 --> 00:35:23.606]  I'm going to break all this down, coming up here in a moment.
[00:35:24.446 --> 00:35:38.252]  Then I intend to have Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network join us to talk about the intel they've got of what dirty tricks Hillary may play going into the last 83 days of this election.
[00:35:40.475 --> 00:35:53.179]  We talked to our contact, we talked to our pipeline, to the Secret Service, and they added some very important information.
[00:35:57.961 --> 00:36:07.984]  Dealing with Hillary staging a false flag against herself, an assassination attempt that lines up with our other information that comes from another source, from another agency.
[00:36:09.184 --> 00:36:14.928]  And also confirming other information about what they're having to do to keep her from going into epileptic seizures.
[00:36:14.948 --> 00:36:17.850]  So I'm going to have Joe Biggs pop in for about 10 minutes.
[00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:22.152]  He's in Milwaukee with the rest of the crew, Jakari, Jackson, and Rob Dew.
[00:36:22.172 --> 00:36:30.297]  They're going to be covering the Donald Trump rally coming up this evening from inside and outside in a suburb of Milwaukee.
[00:36:31.158 --> 00:36:35.681]  So if InfoWarriors want to come out for that, that's very, very important to do tonight.
[00:36:36.738 --> 00:36:41.942]  You just look at Donald J. Trump's website and find the exact precise location.
[00:36:42.323 --> 00:36:43.864]  I'll announce that later as well.
[00:36:45.265 --> 00:36:49.649]  But before I go any further and also get into what's happening in the economy front,
[00:36:51.923 --> 00:37:04.736]  Ancient defense is very, very hard for us to keep in stock because it's got so many ingredients in it that we want to keep at California level standards, which means they basically have to be so clean it's almost impossible.
[00:37:05.196 --> 00:37:14.125]  But there has to be so much testing of the raw materials that a lot of times it takes up to six months to get living defense.
[00:37:15.612 --> 00:37:17.033]  Back into stock.
[00:37:17.554 --> 00:37:21.217]  We also, again, have the herbal version that's liquid, Ancient Defense.
[00:37:21.757 --> 00:37:28.122]  But Living Defense, a lot of times, is sold out for up to six months.
[00:37:31.545 --> 00:37:41.813]  Despite the fact that it's gonna sell out in the next three, four days, and it'll probably be a month till we get more in, where we're getting better about getting it in quicker and sourcing it, we are still offering 20% off right now.
[00:37:45.382 --> 00:37:55.773]  So I want to encourage everybody out there to take advantage of this and to go read Why Living Defense, but also Ancient Defense, is so important, but specifically Living Defense.
[00:37:56.413 --> 00:38:00.918]  It's got wild-crafted black walnut, green whole, and then it just goes on from there.
[00:38:00.958 --> 00:38:05.022]  I'm not going to read to you all the known herbs and known
[00:38:07.284 --> 00:38:16.206]  Plant-derived compounds that for thousands of years have been known to safely and in a healthy way flush the body of parasites.
[00:38:17.327 --> 00:38:25.829]  This is something that from the research we've done and what Dr. Grip says you should do twice a year and you just take a few of the caplets a day.
[00:38:25.929 --> 00:38:31.251]  It's a powder, so you have better absorbability and it is simply amazing what happens.
[00:38:31.311 --> 00:38:35.652]  In fact, I have been back on a parasite cleanse myself
[00:38:37.398 --> 00:38:46.321]  And I've been taking this for the last week and just the things that are in it are already so good for your body on top of it.
[00:38:46.582 --> 00:38:51.303]  This is the ultimate formulation for a parasite detox, in my opinion.
[00:38:55.285 --> 00:38:59.347]  And your purchase, again, of the product makes everything we do here possible.
[00:38:59.487 --> 00:39:02.328]  I cannot stress enough the obvious
[00:39:04.125 --> 00:39:17.135]  value of having this broadcast and having it expand in the face of the globalists, for us to be able to send our reporters around the country and around the world, for us to be able to have nightly news and special programs and documentaries and to have our writers and researchers.
[00:39:17.636 --> 00:39:22.380]  You can see how our analysis is spot on.
[00:39:25.242 --> 00:39:30.286]  You can see how our analysis of the globalist operations
[00:39:32.717 --> 00:39:33.717]  Is changing the world.
[00:39:34.418 --> 00:39:35.418]  And that's not hype.
[00:39:35.578 --> 00:39:36.439]  That's not talk.
[00:39:36.619 --> 00:39:37.999]  That's not bragging.
[00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:38.560]  It's fact.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.081]  I'm not here telling you that so that, oh, I'm a big shot.
[00:39:42.141 --> 00:39:44.042]  I'm telling you that you are the InfoWars.
[00:39:44.122 --> 00:39:46.663]  You're the reason this operation is so successful.
[00:39:47.804 --> 00:39:49.224]  InfoWars is the ship.
[00:39:50.305 --> 00:39:54.646]  Our crew are the sails and the rigging and the brains of the operation.
[00:39:55.507 --> 00:40:00.209]  But you are the ocean and the wind which propels the craft.
[00:40:01.613 --> 00:40:02.874]  Without you, we're dead in the water.
[00:40:03.595 --> 00:40:06.237]  So you are just as important as the ship itself.
[00:40:07.618 --> 00:40:10.581]  In fact, your support of us built the ship itself.
[00:40:11.302 --> 00:40:12.303]  You are not just the wind.
[00:40:12.863 --> 00:40:23.533]  When you decide to promote an article, when you decide to share a link, Drudge, it came out yesterday in mainstream news, is the number one website, news website in the world.
[00:40:24.554 --> 00:40:25.915]  Infowars is 80-something.
[00:40:26.676 --> 00:40:28.097]  Up 10 points in ranking.
[00:40:30.165 --> 00:40:35.348]  And that's using real Google Analytics, and that's what even mainstream media breaks down and says.
[00:40:35.408 --> 00:40:40.151]  Bigger than the New York Times, bigger than Facebook.
[00:40:40.332 --> 00:40:43.914]  All of it combined, more traffic on Drudge.
[00:40:45.015 --> 00:40:49.197]  Number one, beating out Fox, beating out CNN, beating out all of it.
[00:40:50.278 --> 00:40:51.699]  Now what does that tell you about them?
[00:40:52.179 --> 00:40:53.160]  It tells you they're a joke.
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:57.763]  And look at how InfoWars is growing, and look at how the information we cover
[00:40:59.298 --> 00:41:00.619]  Is now being covered by Breitbart.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.861]  Is now being covered by the Daily Caller.
[00:41:03.862 --> 00:41:10.547]  Is now being covered by even mainstream news because what we're saying is the truth and I've never wanted to be underground.
[00:41:11.889 --> 00:41:25.540]  And always on the outside and just failing and being a beautiful loser who's too cool and nobody gets me and, you know, I run around at coffee shops and I'm into myself and, oh my gosh, I'm so intellectual.
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.102]  I'm just a person of the people who wants liberty and common sense.
[00:41:30.043 --> 00:41:41.707]  Who is taking action and wreaking havoc to the New World Order and trying to get other people to realize that their very future depends on this and the globalists hate you and hate your family.
[00:41:42.427 --> 00:41:43.548]  And you should take that personal.
[00:41:44.718 --> 00:41:47.999]  We're being usurped by a form of 21st century warfare.
[00:41:48.479 --> 00:41:49.419]  We are under attack.
[00:41:49.739 --> 00:41:51.399]  This is the 21st century war.
[00:41:51.899 --> 00:41:52.579]  It's economic.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.240]  It's replacing humans.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.540]  It's destroying the family.
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.100]  It's turning us all against each other.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.321]  This is a scientific attack.
[00:41:59.721 --> 00:42:02.941]  And they tell you what they're doing in the movie The Kingsman.
[00:42:05.522 --> 00:42:12.183]  They dumb it down that a wavelength's being sent out over the cell phones to cause our primitive brains to kick on and make us kill each other.
[00:42:13.271 --> 00:42:16.532]  That is a dumbed-down allegory of what's actually going on.
[00:42:17.032 --> 00:42:25.014]  And it's a billionaire working with other billionaires to wipe out the population of the Earth, 99%, to bring in a utopia.
[00:42:28.816 --> 00:42:31.096]  Now, you may have heard of that theme before.
[00:42:31.256 --> 00:42:32.057]  Moonraker.
[00:42:32.577 --> 00:42:34.397]  Written in the 50s by Ian Fleming.
[00:42:34.737 --> 00:42:36.738]  High-level OSS and then MI6.
[00:42:37.478 --> 00:42:39.739]  Telling you what globalists were talking about.
[00:42:40.438 --> 00:43:03.788]  The allegory of going up into space while you bioweapon the whole Earth, the pathogen, the biological pathogen, runs its course, phases out, is designed to mutate until it's no longer harmful, and you return to Earth and repopulate it with your eugenics dream.
[00:43:04.088 --> 00:43:05.689]  They're telling you the plan.
[00:43:07.176 --> 00:43:08.817]  But they're going to do it in slow motion.
[00:43:09.477 --> 00:43:15.120]  Because while they poison us and kill us and torture us slowly, they want to find cures for themselves.
[00:43:15.821 --> 00:43:19.543]  So while they're testing all of this on us, they're looking for mutations.
[00:43:20.263 --> 00:43:26.447]  They're looking for what they call the Lazarus gene.
[00:43:27.587 --> 00:43:29.688]  They're looking for immortal cell lines.
[00:43:29.769 --> 00:43:30.829]  And let me give you a newsflash.
[00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:35.872]  They have found immortal cell lines that never die.
[00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:41.511]  Think about that.
[00:43:44.034 --> 00:43:44.414]  Look it up.
[00:43:46.857 --> 00:43:48.059]  Only flame kills them.
[00:43:49.601 --> 00:43:54.407]  The globalists know we're not in Kansas anymore, and it's time for all of us to figure out we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:43:56.044 --> 00:44:06.568]  Now, just like I tell you George Soros is planning to flood the West with third world populations, to weaponize them, to have them all have chips on their shoulders, and to have them be political tools to burn down any city whenever he wants.
[00:44:07.329 --> 00:44:09.109]  Basically all admitted, all come out.
[00:44:09.169 --> 00:44:13.611]  They use them as weapons, skim the money off the top they got from social welfare programs.
[00:44:13.931 --> 00:44:16.592]  It's all coming out because here's what's happening.
[00:44:16.852 --> 00:44:20.254]  The intelligence agencies, who aren't perfect,
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:30.250]  Realize that there's no future under this New World Order and I don't care whether it's MI6 or the CIA or the FBI or who it is, the Russians.
[00:44:30.851 --> 00:44:35.096]  Everybody is coming together and realizing this New World Order has got to be stopped.
[00:44:35.116 --> 00:44:39.461]  I mean, we're going to let some 87-year-old crazy Nazi collaborator freakazoid
[00:44:40.814 --> 00:44:47.396]  Blow up the West and bring us into world financial ruin because he wants to lord over a bunch of poor people because he's an asshole?
[00:44:48.476 --> 00:44:50.056]  Excuse me using that term, I apologize.
[00:44:50.696 --> 00:44:52.177]  Because it's not strong enough for him.
[00:44:52.417 --> 00:44:54.117]  He is a demonic demon.
[00:44:58.878 --> 00:44:59.939]  Who wants to run the world.
[00:45:02.239 --> 00:45:04.740]  And of course he can't do that because of business.
[00:45:06.772 --> 00:45:07.952]  He can't do it because of free market.
[00:45:07.992 --> 00:45:11.193]  He can't dominate, so he has to blow it all up to say he rules it.
[00:45:12.173 --> 00:45:12.773]  I've got to read this.
[00:45:12.813 --> 00:45:13.453]  Hold on one second.
[00:45:17.854 --> 00:45:18.094]  Okay.
[00:45:20.595 --> 00:45:24.335]  Remember that thing I said earlier about that particular article?
[00:45:24.395 --> 00:45:26.396]  Like I said, post it under our byline.
[00:45:27.096 --> 00:45:27.816]  Entire thing, please.
[00:45:27.836 --> 00:45:28.116]  Thank you.
[00:45:30.817 --> 00:45:32.297]  And I'm dealing with some other stuff right now.
[00:45:35.768 --> 00:45:44.435]  I'm dealing with some other news that is so over the top, that's why the globalists get away with what they do, because the things they do are just so incredibly crazy.
[00:45:45.295 --> 00:45:52.941]  Finishing up, going back to the plug, Living Defense is now 20% off for a limited time, because we're going to have to hold something back for folks that are signed up for AutoShip.
[00:45:53.221 --> 00:46:00.487]  You can get free shipping when you sign up for AutoShip, and you can also get free shipping when you
[00:46:01.701 --> 00:46:06.185]  Get orders of $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:46:06.605 --> 00:46:10.589]  So, InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:13.572]  Also, the new film, Amerageddon, is out.
[00:46:13.632 --> 00:46:14.472]  It's the director's cut.
[00:46:14.632 --> 00:46:20.438]  Exclusively available for the next week or so at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:20.458 --> 00:46:22.740]  You get a second copy and you get two of my films free.
[00:46:24.522 --> 00:46:29.826]  There's a bunch of different variants where you can choose which two of my films you want free.
[00:46:30.306 --> 00:46:34.590]  Like Matrix of Evil, or Fall of the Republic, or America Destroyed by Design.
[00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:38.152]  All available at infowarestore.com.
[00:46:38.933 --> 00:46:39.773]  Or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:46:39.793 --> 00:46:42.015]  And again, that is the oxygen that helps fund the fires of liberty.
[00:46:50.734 --> 00:46:51.875]  Let's get into this now.
[00:46:52.495 --> 00:46:56.016]  I mentioned it earlier, but think about what a big deal this is.
[00:46:57.897 --> 00:47:01.439]  Stanford University confirms Democratic election fraud.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:08.842]  This is being reported on by the Hill newspaper and many others.
[00:47:08.862 --> 00:47:12.964]  That's really got to be upsetting the establishment.
[00:47:14.244 --> 00:47:19.987]  The bombshell study released by Stanford University confirms evidence of election fraud during the 2016 Democratic
[00:47:20.885 --> 00:47:21.845]  Party primaries.
[00:47:21.865 --> 00:47:32.828]  According to a paper released this week entitled, We Are Witnessing a Dishonest Election, a state comparison based on voting procedures used during the election reveals endemic election fraud within the system.
[00:47:33.348 --> 00:47:34.008]  That's at the top.
[00:47:34.368 --> 00:47:35.709]  Election fraud is not voter fraud.
[00:47:36.269 --> 00:47:44.431]  Given the stakes in the outcome of the American presidential elections, ensuring the integrity of the electoral process is of the utmost importance.
[00:47:45.351 --> 00:47:48.832]  And there's going to be more hacks, a little bird told me there were other hacks.
[00:47:49.861 --> 00:48:01.845]  That have certain parties directing the fraud, and preparing at the general election, and organizing the illegals to vote, and the dead people to vote.
[00:48:02.665 --> 00:48:08.407]  Oh, I'm afraid all the emails will be released before you have the election.
[00:48:10.928 --> 00:48:18.130]  And no amount of false flags, Soros, are going to put that genie back in the little bottle.
[00:48:21.533 --> 00:48:24.614]  You can run on for a long time, creepy man.
[00:48:26.134 --> 00:48:30.295]  Are the results we are witnessing in the 2016 primary elections trustworthy?
[00:48:30.996 --> 00:48:43.179]  While Donald Trump enjoys a clear and early edge over the Republican rivals, the Democratic contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders has been far more competitive.
[00:48:43.199 --> 00:48:49.481]  And then it goes back to articles where they tried to spin the whole thing, but where they did end up stealing it from Bernie Sanders.
[00:48:51.001 --> 00:48:58.383]  Now, let's go ahead and get to this article that Roger Stone wrote for the Hill newspaper.
[00:48:58.443 --> 00:49:00.704]  He also sent it to us to post it on fullwars.com.
[00:49:01.624 --> 00:49:04.125]  Can the 2016 election be rigged?
[00:49:04.365 --> 00:49:04.805]  You bet!
[00:49:06.426 --> 00:49:12.208]  Donald Trump has said publicly that he fears the next election will be rigged based on both
[00:49:13.817 --> 00:49:15.378]  Technical capability and recent history.
[00:49:15.698 --> 00:49:17.138]  Trump's concerns are not unfounded.
[00:49:17.658 --> 00:49:23.381]  A recent study by Sanford Research University provided that Hillary Clinton's campaign rigged the system to steal the nomination from Bernie Sanders.
[00:49:23.701 --> 00:49:26.042]  What does that mean to Bernie Sanders in Wisconsin?
[00:49:26.062 --> 00:49:26.782]  It's stunning.
[00:49:28.223 --> 00:49:29.644]  And then it goes on to the history of that.
[00:49:30.184 --> 00:49:40.410]  Politico profiled a Princeton professor who has demonstrated how the election voting machines that are most widely used can be hacked in five minutes or less.
[00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:54.058]  Robert Fetrakis, who I want to get on, Professor of Political Science in the Social and Behavioral Sciences Department at Columbus State Community College has written a must-read book on the strip and flip technique
[00:49:56.209 --> 00:49:57.530]  Used to rig these machines.
[00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:02.752]  Professor is a Green Party activist, in case you're thinking he's some Republican.
[00:50:04.173 --> 00:50:11.476]  A computer hacker showed CBS News last week how to vote multiple times using a $15 electronic device.
[00:50:11.596 --> 00:50:14.058]  Again, they've designed these things to be defrauded.
[00:50:14.098 --> 00:50:14.498]  But listen.
[00:50:15.796 --> 00:50:28.790]  Then they argue, well, nobody's announcing it nationally, so you can't steal it nationally because you can only steal it locally and then just hope that enough local thefts allow whoever the system wants to get into power, get into power.
[00:50:30.669 --> 00:50:45.275]  No, they have a secretive group made up of six media outlets headed up by the Associated Press, formerly Voter News Services, now it's got two or three new names to confuse the public, that just announces who the winners are.
[00:50:45.295 --> 00:50:47.556]  And listen, I know our audience already knows this.
[00:50:48.656 --> 00:50:58.961]  I'm just pointing out that more and more it's coming out that this is going on and that it's very, very exciting to see this unfolding and see this happening because Donald Trump's standing up
[00:50:59.963 --> 00:51:08.491]  To election fraud is shining more light on this critical issue than we've ever seen before, because we finally have a candidate that actually is calling fraud for what it is.
[00:51:09.051 --> 00:51:09.532]  Stay with us.
[00:51:24.768 --> 00:51:28.811]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[00:51:29.131 --> 00:51:35.215]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[00:51:35.595 --> 00:51:43.120]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure, wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:48.263]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better.
[00:51:49.163 --> 00:51:54.767]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[00:52:04.233 --> 00:52:05.974]  Right here in Detroit.
[00:52:06.515 --> 00:52:12.139]  It's all training us to accept less, lowering expectations, a post-industrial world, a new dark age.
[00:52:12.319 --> 00:52:16.102]  That's what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[00:52:16.382 --> 00:52:24.649]  When we abandoned the policy of America first, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.
[00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:29.172]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger.
[00:52:29.452 --> 00:52:31.694]  A world that gets uglier and stupider and more
[00:52:32.555 --> 00:52:39.059]  The government should allow Hillary Clinton to become President of the United States.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.301]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[00:52:41.601 --> 00:52:42.682]  Well, I voted for Hillary.
[00:52:42.902 --> 00:52:44.944]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[00:52:45.244 --> 00:52:47.145]  You want an image of the future, Winston?
[00:52:47.365 --> 00:52:49.527]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[00:52:49.607 --> 00:52:56.012]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[00:52:56.252 --> 00:53:00.734]  Women are treated discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[00:53:01.054 --> 00:53:04.535]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[00:53:04.595 --> 00:53:05.515]  They're mistreated.
[00:53:06.155 --> 00:53:07.516]  She claims to be their champion.
[00:53:07.536 --> 00:53:16.519]  Don't look at me, Weston, and see the black circles around my eyes, and see how ugly and weak I am, expressing myself and dying, and I torture people 18 hours a day, and I have a horrible life.
[00:53:16.759 --> 00:53:21.100]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power ripping apart humanity.
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:22.361]  We're here to hurt humans.
[00:53:22.521 --> 00:53:23.961]  We're here to suck your guts out!
[00:53:39.978 --> 00:53:41.839]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[00:53:41.899 --> 00:53:43.801]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:53:43.861 --> 00:53:46.582]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[00:53:46.782 --> 00:53:47.603]  Alex Jones.
[00:53:47.703 --> 00:53:50.445]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:53:50.505 --> 00:53:53.707]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:53:53.747 --> 00:53:55.048]  Deeply I think racist.
[00:53:55.068 --> 00:53:57.009]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:58.930]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:03.013]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:54:03.033 --> 00:54:04.194]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:04.254 --> 00:54:09.157]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:44.607]  Well, the police chief has come out and pointed out that the problem the last three nights in Milwaukee after a black police officer shot a black armed man with a felony record...
[00:54:45.595 --> 00:54:49.198]  Was stirred up by the Communist Party that had been brought in from Chicago.
[00:54:49.338 --> 00:54:51.460]  And that is what we experience basically every single time.
[00:54:51.981 --> 00:54:53.082]  Now, I want to be clear.
[00:54:53.942 --> 00:54:55.864]  This is not about a referendum on the police.
[00:54:56.405 --> 00:55:06.794]  It's not about saying the police are perfect, or there aren't bad cops, or legislatures aren't passing bad laws that are unconstitutional, and putting police officers in an unconstitutional role.
[00:55:07.354 --> 00:55:09.676]  I have big issues with it, and always have.
[00:55:09.997 --> 00:55:11.358]  But I'm not mentally ill.
[00:55:13.174 --> 00:55:19.679]  If a bad cop does something somewhere else and then someone randomly shoots another cop, that's called craziness.
[00:55:20.819 --> 00:55:28.625]  And we have globalists trying to destabilize this country and other countries, and we have their own emails and their own battle plans.
[00:55:29.085 --> 00:55:30.686]  But I don't need a Soros hack.
[00:55:32.087 --> 00:55:33.828]  The UN admits they're doing this.
[00:55:34.048 --> 00:55:37.251]  The UN, the State Department admits they spent $5 billion.
[00:55:39.901 --> 00:55:45.222]  Starting six years ago to overthrow Ukraine, overthrow an elected government.
[00:55:46.763 --> 00:55:56.665]  And they started talking about police brutality and using cases in the media that Soros and others were funding to make the police emblematic of the evil government.
[00:55:57.545 --> 00:55:59.346]  And the government was doing some bad stuff.
[00:55:59.646 --> 00:56:01.386]  And the police had done some bad things.
[00:56:01.626 --> 00:56:07.228]  But the point is foreign outside interest came in and stirred it all up
[00:56:08.086 --> 00:56:09.367]  To get a shooting war going.
[00:56:09.988 --> 00:56:16.353]  Now, shooting wars are bad for business, bad for kids going to school, bad for stock markets.
[00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:17.894]  See?
[00:56:18.535 --> 00:56:20.156]  We got a big, wealthy country.
[00:56:20.216 --> 00:56:21.137]  It's got problems.
[00:56:21.918 --> 00:56:25.681]  But we sure don't need to burn it all down, do we, to fix the problem.
[00:56:25.741 --> 00:56:25.961]  No!
[00:56:26.502 --> 00:56:33.628]  And by the way, if poor people get induced by an evil mastermind to burn down their own neighborhoods, that doesn't help them, does it?
[00:56:35.123 --> 00:56:39.386]  I'm going to end up being just fine, because I'm a wise person.
[00:56:39.787 --> 00:56:40.988]  I know how things work.
[00:56:41.428 --> 00:56:42.509]  I've made preparations.
[00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:54.458]  So if I disliked people in the inner city, I'd be like George Soros, inducing them with change agents on the ground, foundation funded, to burn this baby to the ground.
[00:56:57.529 --> 00:56:59.070]  It's such a sick joke.
[00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:02.152]  And Sheriff David Clark, who I just love.
[00:57:02.172 --> 00:57:03.272]  We need to get him back on the show.
[00:57:03.292 --> 00:57:04.253]  He's been on many times.
[00:57:05.153 --> 00:57:11.177]  He has come out and said, listen, let's get off the police for a minute.
[00:57:12.297 --> 00:57:13.738]  It's about ghetto reform.
[00:57:14.338 --> 00:57:16.800]  And it's about the culture of helplessness and what's happening.
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:19.281]  And the fact that Milwaukee's getting poorer, folks.
[00:57:19.301 --> 00:57:20.642]  Doesn't matter what color you are.
[00:57:20.842 --> 00:57:22.003]  The country's falling apart.
[00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:26.352]  You've got nasty, evil, big foundations from Chicago.
[00:57:26.372 --> 00:57:27.713]  They're little commie fronts.
[00:57:28.873 --> 00:57:30.094]  The Weatherman 2.0.
[00:57:31.155 --> 00:57:33.597]  Literally, that's what he said, coming in to do this.
[00:57:33.637 --> 00:57:34.177]  It's a joke!
[00:57:34.197 --> 00:57:35.178]  It's a joke!
[00:57:35.558 --> 00:57:36.038]  It's a joke!
[00:57:36.398 --> 00:57:37.379]  Milwaukee's liberal!
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.281]  Milwaukee has incredible integration.
[00:57:40.581 --> 00:57:41.622]  Milwaukee people get along.
[00:57:41.662 --> 00:57:43.323]  Milwaukee's not racist on average.
[00:57:43.723 --> 00:57:44.624]  It's a load of bull.
[00:57:44.824 --> 00:57:46.765]  Black cop shoots a black guy waving a gun?
[00:57:46.785 --> 00:57:52.248]  That's not... That is not a reason to go around burning stuff down for George Soros.
[00:57:52.289 --> 00:57:52.809]  Let's play the clip.
[00:57:56.049 --> 00:58:17.441]  Serves as an igniter, there's no doubt, but to an already volatile situation, a volatile mix of urban pathologies, failed urban policy that exacerbates inescapable poverty, failing public schools, inadequate parenting, father absent homes.
[00:58:17.461 --> 00:58:21.964]  We all know when fathers are not around to shape the behavior of young boys, they
[00:58:22.987 --> 00:58:28.009]  Often times grow up to be unmanageable misfits that the police have to deal with in an aggressive fashion.
[00:58:28.329 --> 00:58:33.170]  But I think it's important to point out as well, because we tend to gloss over this stuff, we keep focusing on the police.
[00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:35.531]  We keep focusing on the police.
[00:58:36.911 --> 00:58:40.672]  And I've said publicly before, stop trying to fix the police, fix the ghetto.
[00:58:40.752 --> 00:58:42.453]  And I've talked about those urban pathologies.
[00:58:43.053 --> 00:58:45.674]  Alright, high points, the full video is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:58:45.714 --> 00:58:47.915]  We've got a bunch of clips coming up, and a guest.
[00:58:47.935 --> 00:58:49.535]  Stay with us, this is important folks.
[00:58:49.835 --> 00:58:52.396]  We have their own battle plans to bring our countries down.
[00:58:53.482 --> 00:58:54.923]  Soros needs to be arrested right now.
[00:58:56.063 --> 00:58:57.283]  If he goes to Russia, he will be.
[00:59:00.885 --> 00:59:02.785]  Article from the Associated Press.
[00:59:03.065 --> 00:59:11.308]  A Chicago-based communist revolutionary group was blamed by Milwaukee's police chief for stoking a second day of violence.
[00:59:11.769 --> 00:59:20.672]  Police Chief Ed Flynn said members of a Chicago chapter of the Revolutionary Communist Party turned what had been a peaceful night into a tense one.
[00:59:21.112 --> 00:59:25.515]  TV footage showed a small group of protesters walking or running through the streets.
[00:59:25.755 --> 00:59:39.844]  The fatal police shooting of a 23-year-old black man, Savelle Smith, touched off a weekend of tense and at times violent protests that left at least six businesses burned and several officers injured by flying objects Saturday night.
[00:59:40.044 --> 00:59:45.968]  Fourteen people were arrested overnight, and three police officers and four sheriff's deputies were injured.
[00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:49.053]  InfoWars has its team on the ground.
[00:59:49.393 --> 00:59:54.059]  News Director Rob Dew has already filmed communist recruitment signage.
[00:59:54.399 --> 00:59:58.083]  Go to InfoWars.com for breaking news on Milwaukee.
[01:00:02.048 --> 01:00:04.731]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:20.493 --> 01:00:23.956]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:24.536 --> 01:00:26.337]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.698 --> 01:00:31.201]  I started having Doug Hagman on about seven years ago.
[01:00:32.482 --> 01:00:33.522]  And I'll be honest with you.
[01:00:36.254 --> 01:00:38.215]  I mean, I knew he had a lot of good police contacts.
[01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:44.698]  I know he trains police departments mainly in the Northeast and also does private work for the FBI and others.
[01:00:45.459 --> 01:00:49.881]  But he was saying Obama was going to try to start a destabilization race war and that George Soros was involved.
[01:00:50.822 --> 01:00:53.003]  And I just thought, hey, the establishment's already running everything.
[01:00:53.043 --> 01:00:53.743]  Why would they do that?
[01:00:53.763 --> 01:00:55.364]  And we've got a police state they're setting up.
[01:00:55.384 --> 01:00:59.046]  I mean, won't that control everything?
[01:00:59.086 --> 01:01:00.287]  Why would they want to destabilize stuff?
[01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:03.108]  But I tell you, everything you talked about came true.
[01:01:03.148 --> 01:01:04.389]  He's given us amazing
[01:01:05.464 --> 01:01:10.328]  Information over the years before any of this, you know, race riot stuff even started up.
[01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:15.392]  So he's going to be joining us coming up at the start of the next segment.
[01:01:15.492 --> 01:01:19.656]  And I want to bounce a lot of stuff off of him that we've gotten from the Secret Service.
[01:01:19.836 --> 01:01:23.539]  And by the way, when I talk about that, I'm not even proud of that.
[01:01:26.741 --> 01:01:28.943]  Getting handed a lit stick of dynamite, basically.
[01:01:32.486 --> 01:01:33.327]  It's something I got to do.
[01:01:33.347 --> 01:01:34.908]  It's a responsibility I've got to have.
[01:01:37.083 --> 01:01:40.146]  Folks would say it's prestigious to have the Secret Service leak information to you.
[01:01:40.726 --> 01:01:42.148]  I mean, in their history, they don't really do that.
[01:01:42.168 --> 01:01:45.070]  I had Dan Bongino on here standing.
[01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:46.451]  I said, why do you think that's happening?
[01:01:46.491 --> 01:01:47.912]  And he was a former senior agent.
[01:01:47.932 --> 01:01:55.399]  He said, no, I don't doubt that's happening because the country's in so much trouble and the Secret Service is being persecuted and they know what criminals are dealing with.
[01:01:55.439 --> 01:01:57.140]  And I said, well, you know, what's an example?
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.382]  And he just said, it's worse than you know.
[01:02:00.563 --> 01:02:01.404]  Total trashiness.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:10.686]  I mean, reportedly, Hillary talks like a sailor, just walks around with her sleeves rolled up, punching Bill Clinton in the face before she was so ill.
[01:02:11.006 --> 01:02:12.027]  I mean, she's a piece of work.
[01:02:12.648 --> 01:02:17.131]  And just, well, you know, stealing, not just the cutlery and plates, but furniture.
[01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:21.155]  I mean, they're just, they are total criminals.
[01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:21.975]  They are trash.
[01:02:22.536 --> 01:02:23.076]  They're filth.
[01:02:24.858 --> 01:02:27.400]  Obama doesn't steal stuff out of the White House, and he's polite to people.
[01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:33.279]  The Clintons, I think the Clintons are worse than Obama.
[01:02:33.319 --> 01:02:34.059]  In fact, I'm sure of it.
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:40.461]  Obama's got some evil energy about him, and he wants to bring the U.S.
[01:02:40.481 --> 01:02:43.142]  down a few pegs, and he is an Islamicist.
[01:02:46.524 --> 01:02:48.044]  And he is trying to make Kenya go Islamic.
[01:02:48.964 --> 01:02:49.785]  He's a horrible person.
[01:02:49.825 --> 01:02:50.245]  He's horrible.
[01:02:51.965 --> 01:02:59.228]  But it really shows you something that Hillary, behind the scenes, isn't ever nice.
[01:03:00.799 --> 01:03:07.581]  It's one thing, you know, high pressure, this is media, I get mad, people have arguments, that goes on, but then I'm sorry for it later, or folks that are rude to me are sorry.
[01:03:07.922 --> 01:03:09.642]  I mean, she doesn't give people tips.
[01:03:11.263 --> 01:03:12.423]  You can't look her in the eyes.
[01:03:13.463 --> 01:03:14.824]  She loves to get people fired.
[01:03:14.944 --> 01:03:16.184]  She loves to fire people.
[01:03:16.224 --> 01:03:17.545]  She loves to rub stuff in.
[01:03:17.905 --> 01:03:19.926]  She loves to gloat over pettiness.
[01:03:20.626 --> 01:03:23.107]  Hillary Clinton does not give tips.
[01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:33.435]  I mean, I get a good feeling out of being middle class and having some extra money, and when somebody does good service, giving them a 20-25% tip.
[01:03:34.276 --> 01:03:34.876]  Bad service?
[01:03:36.118 --> 01:03:45.026]  I'm not supposed to complain, but if somebody's bad enough that I don't want to give them a tip, I call them over and say, you're rude, and you need to get ahead in life and not act so, you know, have such an attitude problem.
[01:03:46.227 --> 01:03:50.391]  Well, and then I'll say, I mean, my family hates it when I do this, but I'm all about getting past comfort zones.
[01:03:50.411 --> 01:03:52.453]  And I'll say it real nice, and I'll say something wrong.
[01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:55.070]  Yeah, I'm really having a bad day.
[01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:58.013]  Okay, we still have a 15% tip then, but try with a better attitude.
[01:03:58.033 --> 01:04:02.056]  You really, you know, gave us attitude and everything, and it makes me not want to come to this restaurant anymore.
[01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:05.499]  See, I mean, I'm all about really getting past comfort zones with people.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:21.672]  And political correctness is all about being all creeped out and scared of everybody, and no one talks with everybody, and nobody actually hangs out with each other, so that it's this sick form of basically segregation, where we're all forcibly integrated with each other, but to fight with each other.
[01:04:23.982 --> 01:04:26.285]  It is absolute mind control.
[01:04:27.647 --> 01:04:28.448]  And they admit it is.
[01:04:28.588 --> 01:04:29.269]  And it's run.
[01:04:29.289 --> 01:04:30.291]  I just keep going back to this.
[01:04:30.351 --> 01:04:31.713]  I've got hundreds of news articles.
[01:04:32.854 --> 01:04:34.877]  I'm not going back to this for lack of news coverage.
[01:04:36.253 --> 01:04:54.424]  It feels good, though, to see it be a top news story in the country that George Soros' emails are how they're purposely behind the illegals coming in, purposely behind the immigrant invasion, to balkanize Europe, destabilize things, and then milk the social services networks that the big banks and others make money off of and administer.
[01:04:55.384 --> 01:05:07.711]  You have to understand, these Socialist Democratic Parties, they make all these illegals they come in, basically work for them, and do all sorts of scams for them, and tax returns, fake tax returns.
[01:05:07.931 --> 01:05:08.652]  It's like Acorn.
[01:05:10.475 --> 01:05:16.618]  Let's talk about Amerigeddon, which is available at Infowarsstore.com exclusively right now for the next week or so.
[01:05:16.898 --> 01:05:19.399]  You get two copies and you get two free films with it.
[01:05:19.479 --> 01:05:22.021]  Yeah, and this is an important movie because it's fact-based.
[01:05:22.901 --> 01:05:29.284]  We tell a story about an EMP attack, an electromagnetic pulse attack on America, that shuts down the grid.
[01:05:29.945 --> 01:05:36.228]  And our Congress has warned that if this were to happen, 90% of the American population would die in 12 months.
[01:05:37.348 --> 01:05:42.010]  To quote Henry Kissinger, the only thing standing in the way of a new world order is a strong America.
[01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:50.553]  One of the ways that they can diminish America quickly and severely is to allow for an EMP attack on this country.
[01:05:51.093 --> 01:05:56.856]  And in light of the events and things that are happening, I'm afraid this is a very likely scenario.
[01:05:56.916 --> 01:05:57.936]  So I made a movie about it.
[01:05:58.196 --> 01:06:00.397]  It's an entertaining movie, but it's fact-based.
[01:06:00.937 --> 01:06:07.299]  People are getting the director's cut that is even bigger than what you see in theaters, and so this is the first look director's cut.
[01:06:07.399 --> 01:06:16.941]  You know, Hollywood has tried to diminish the final edit on this thing, but what Alex has available here at his website this week is everything.
[01:06:17.081 --> 01:06:18.061]  The most hardcore version.
[01:06:18.281 --> 01:06:18.481]  Yep.
[01:06:19.002 --> 01:06:24.843]  So this is a great place to acquire the movie and then to show it to your friends and family and even your churches.
[01:06:25.063 --> 01:06:46.468]  That's right, you can get one copy of the film Amerigeddon on DVD at Infowarsstore.com exclusively right now, or get a second copy, two copies for $39.90, and get my first film, America Destroyed by Design, and then one of my latest, most powerful films, Fall of the Republic, that breaks down everything currently happening, free.
[01:06:46.748 --> 01:06:52.049]  Two films free when you purchase two Amerigeddons, and I'm doing that because I want
[01:06:52.529 --> 01:06:54.090]  to get this film out.
[01:06:54.390 --> 01:07:01.973]  Another big thing people can do if you really want to reach a lot of people, get two copies, keep one for your own archive to share, take the other and donate it to the library.
[01:07:02.473 --> 01:07:06.054]  So many people are smart because they've closed all the video stores.
[01:07:06.074 --> 01:07:17.218]  I was reading an article about this in the Wall Street Journal about a year ago, that what's the most popular now at libraries is not the books anymore, but is people going and actually checking out the DVDs, the Blu-rays, all that.
[01:07:17.719 --> 01:07:20.520]  And so that's why you make a donation of this to your library.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:26.161]  You're going to talk about hundreds of people that are going to check that out and watch it.
[01:07:27.661 --> 01:07:28.581]  That is amazing.
[01:07:28.941 --> 01:07:29.461]  All of that.
[01:07:29.521 --> 01:07:45.324]  I can't tell you how many listeners we run into on the street that found this show, not on a local AM or FM station, but over the internet over the years, that someone gave them a DVD or somebody gave them a card with forbidden information, InfoWars.com, or they saw a bumper sticker and it's just exponential.
[01:07:45.424 --> 01:07:45.984]  It's exponential.
[01:07:46.464 --> 01:07:50.385]  I can't imagine where InfoWars will be in a year, two years, three years.
[01:07:51.426 --> 01:07:55.591]  And I just pray to God that I can be humble and focus and make the right decisions with this great responsibility.
[01:07:55.631 --> 01:07:56.892]  But it's not just Alex Jones.
[01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:58.034]  It's what Gary Haven's doing.
[01:07:58.054 --> 01:07:58.955]  It's what Matt Drudge is doing.
[01:07:58.975 --> 01:08:00.016]  It's what WorldNetDaily is doing.
[01:08:00.056 --> 01:08:03.640]  It's what people like Donald Trump are doing.
[01:08:04.061 --> 01:08:07.445]  We all are just choosing to not be with the new world order.
[01:08:22.256 --> 01:08:27.298]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[01:08:27.818 --> 01:08:30.579]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:31.879 --> 01:08:39.882]  Living in the limelight, the universal dream for those who wish to see.
[01:08:54.597 --> 01:08:57.999]  We're now eight minutes into the second hour of this global transmission.
[01:08:58.159 --> 01:08:59.900]  Our reporters are on the ground in Milwaukee.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:07.505]  They're going to be covering the Trump event in a Milwaukee suburb in Wisconsin tonight, where the communists and others have promised violence.
[01:09:08.205 --> 01:09:10.827]  We of course knew from our Chicago police sources.
[01:09:11.807 --> 01:09:24.713]  That indeed Hillary and the DNC were ordering hundreds and hundreds of demonstrators dressed as Bernie Sanders supporters and were busing them in paid to attack Trump supporters in Chicago and then in other areas.
[01:09:25.254 --> 01:09:28.055]  The media then blamed Trump and Bernie supporters.
[01:09:28.555 --> 01:09:33.317]  That way you hurt Trump voters and you hurt Sanders voters helping Hillary.
[01:09:33.478 --> 01:09:34.958]  That's how divide and conquer works.
[01:09:35.358 --> 01:09:38.260]  This is very elementary what Soros is doing.
[01:09:39.213 --> 01:09:43.254]  Overthrew Ukraine with Catholics and Orthodox fighting each other.
[01:09:43.634 --> 01:09:46.055]  Orthodox in the East, Catholics in the West.
[01:09:46.475 --> 01:09:48.536]  Same split Hitler used in World War II.
[01:09:49.956 --> 01:09:55.218]  They look at sociology, they look at anthropology, they use cultural psychology.
[01:09:57.099 --> 01:10:05.301]  That's why they admit the CIA hires what group, number one, most often what degree?
[01:10:06.642 --> 01:10:07.382]  Sociologists.
[01:10:10.452 --> 01:10:14.396]  And they like people that have combat experience who then get a sociology degree on top of it.
[01:10:14.916 --> 01:10:16.638]  Then they want you to get an anthropology degree.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.342]  And we sit here like morons.
[01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:22.744]  Getting our chain pulled.
[01:10:23.365 --> 01:10:29.508]  And when I say CIA, I mean the globalists that have basically set it up to take this country and the world over.
[01:10:29.828 --> 01:10:33.329]  The CIA is a foreign, alien, globalist organization.
[01:10:33.609 --> 01:10:35.290]  Does that mean there aren't good people in the CIA?
[01:10:36.091 --> 01:10:40.233]  Half the time, the most bold whistleblowers we have on are CIA or former CIA.
[01:10:40.713 --> 01:10:42.494]  We've had quite a few guests that end up getting killed.
[01:10:43.194 --> 01:10:43.934]  This isn't a game.
[01:10:44.895 --> 01:10:45.675]  This isn't a joke.
[01:10:46.155 --> 01:10:47.256]  This is real, people.
[01:10:48.236 --> 01:10:49.597]  And I had
[01:10:50.848 --> 01:11:01.513]  Dan Bongino, a former top Secret Service agent, he ran the foreign details, saying what we say about Obama and Hillary and all the rest of it is worse than what we're saying.
[01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:12.079]  And I told him, I said, RNC ran into the Secret Service, we had the highest level badges, that was national media, we were given the highest level badges by the Trump campaign.
[01:11:12.099 --> 01:11:15.220]  I'm not going to get into inside baseball, but we could go anywhere we wanted.
[01:11:15.981 --> 01:11:16.341]  Anywhere.
[01:11:16.861 --> 01:11:18.282]  Right through the Secret Service, you name it.
[01:11:21.065 --> 01:11:25.106]  And Secret Service reached out to us.
[01:11:25.446 --> 01:11:28.707]  I handed it off to Joe Biggs because he's good at keeping stuff secret with his Army background.
[01:11:30.467 --> 01:11:37.349]  We set up a liaison and they said in the next few weeks you're going to get key intel and it came through confirming everything we already see in the news.
[01:11:37.589 --> 01:11:46.851]  The Parkinson's, the neurological disorders, the falling down, the special handicap systems that lower to the ground just so she can get in the SUVs.
[01:11:48.112 --> 01:11:48.832]  The fact that they're
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:58.025]  Thinking about, and this is the new intel, how to make the announcement that she's so ill and will they have to replace her.
[01:11:58.425 --> 01:12:15.176]  Biggs got contacted by our pipeline, I'll say, last night with more information and confirming the intel we got from a other government agency, let's just say military, of a meeting in California.
[01:12:17.718 --> 01:12:20.200]  And you know all about these meetings with the Vice President and
[01:12:22.014 --> 01:12:27.097]  Or the vice presidential candidate, Cain, and with Soros people and all that going on around the country?
[01:12:27.937 --> 01:12:29.538]  Okay, it was one of those type meetings.
[01:12:30.378 --> 01:12:46.086]  And they just couldn't believe that in the cars leaving the hangars, and when they're there running security at these mansions, these people are just sitting around openly in front of security, blabbering about incredible crime.
[01:12:47.547 --> 01:12:49.508]  And I think that's why the Secret Service is so freaked out.
[01:12:49.528 --> 01:12:50.689]  And I brought this up to Bongino.
[01:12:52.597 --> 01:12:56.699]  And he didn't doubt that we'd had this leak, which is incredibly dangerous, folks.
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:59.521]  I just want you to understand, this is... I'm doing my duty here, bringing this out.
[01:12:59.901 --> 01:13:01.342]  Oh, we got some big story for you.
[01:13:01.702 --> 01:13:04.104]  Notice mainstream media attacks me all the time on stuff.
[01:13:05.545 --> 01:13:07.246]  Silence about our leak.
[01:13:07.606 --> 01:13:08.747]  Come out and say I'm a liar!
[01:13:08.767 --> 01:13:10.548]  Hey, why didn't the Secret Service drop by?
[01:13:11.968 --> 01:13:15.991]  You notice silence because they're at the top trying to figure out what to do right now.
[01:13:17.108 --> 01:13:25.035]  Because no one else is willing to put these leaks out but Infowars, and Drudge, and folks like the Northeast Intelligence Network.
[01:13:25.575 --> 01:13:28.998]  Now, he's going to be with us if he can, 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:13:30.179 --> 01:13:31.900]  And then our reporters are coming on from Milwaukee.
[01:13:31.941 --> 01:13:45.032]  Doug Hagman, I've been hearing him for 15 years on the radio, and I had him on seven, eight years ago, and he was talking about how Obama's going to have a race war, they try to overthrow the country, and they recruit all this division.
[01:13:45.993 --> 01:13:47.574]  They hadn't really kicked all this off yet.
[01:13:47.594 --> 01:13:49.195]  And I was like, really, Hagman?
[01:13:49.235 --> 01:13:50.695]  But, you know, the guy had good credentials.
[01:13:50.735 --> 01:13:52.576]  A lot of folks I respect said he was a good source.
[01:13:53.437 --> 01:14:00.720]  And so, he runs a large, you know, police and training facility, training with dogs, you name it.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.481]  Works with the FBI.
[01:14:02.881 --> 01:14:04.002]  Works with a lot of police departments.
[01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:05.222]  So, you know, he's a good source.
[01:14:05.242 --> 01:14:05.983]  We started getting him on.
[01:14:06.343 --> 01:14:08.904]  And more and more, everything he's talked about has come true.
[01:14:09.364 --> 01:14:11.705]  Not just because of his own research, but his sources.
[01:14:12.926 --> 01:14:14.887]  And we're gonna go over
[01:14:16.823 --> 01:14:23.093]  The information we've gotten, Joe Biggs is going to be popping in later in the interview with more info he got from this conduit.
[01:14:23.133 --> 01:14:25.336]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:14:26.684 --> 01:14:30.285]  And then I'm going to talk to him about how he thinks this whole plan is going.
[01:14:30.525 --> 01:14:42.209]  How's it going for Soros when we know that intelligence agencies, private corporations, and other groups are now hacking the Democratic Party, the entire Democratic Party, the entire Soros operation, the Clintons.
[01:14:42.309 --> 01:14:43.689]  It's all going to get data dumped.
[01:14:43.789 --> 01:14:46.070]  And I've been contacted now to confirm.
[01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:47.911]  Earlier stuff was the Russians.
[01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:53.272]  The carbon taxes being exposed, the high of the decline, climate gate stuff, that is the Russians.
[01:14:53.312 --> 01:14:55.413]  And the Russians are actively penetrating stuff.
[01:14:56.351 --> 01:15:02.516]  But this is not the Russians, that this is US intelligence agencies leaking right now, risking their lives.
[01:15:03.096 --> 01:15:11.603]  Because they know something we don't know about Hillary that's so bad, it's finally turned the, basically the whole government against them.
[01:15:12.624 --> 01:15:15.286]  And we're getting word of what that is.
[01:15:15.947 --> 01:15:18.369]  Hillary Clinton is a communist Chinese agent.
[01:15:18.589 --> 01:15:20.610]  She is on the payroll of the Saudis, we already know that.
[01:15:21.011 --> 01:15:23.653]  But that they have engaged in treason never before seen.
[01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:29.624]  This is just such a dangerous time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:29.684 --> 01:15:30.464]  Everybody can feel it.
[01:15:30.825 --> 01:15:31.525]  You can see it.
[01:15:32.886 --> 01:15:39.410]  And the good news is, there are so many leaks coming out from different angles and places, they can't get everybody.
[01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:44.393]  They can shoot this DNC computer expert four times in the back, who reportedly is the source of the WikiLeaks.
[01:15:44.793 --> 01:15:47.335]  They can kill other people, but they can't kill everybody.
[01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:47.815]  And guess what?
[01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.216]  Folks are past being intimidated.
[01:15:49.456 --> 01:15:52.438]  The leaks are accelerating as the murders take place.
[01:15:53.618 --> 01:15:55.379]  So I don't know how they're going to try to handle this.
[01:15:55.419 --> 01:15:58.559]  A false flag, a staged attack on Hillary, that's the word we're hearing.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:03.141]  But Doug Hagman of HagmanandHagman.com, thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:16:03.161 --> 01:16:05.061]  I've thrown out a lot of points there.
[01:16:05.781 --> 01:16:06.502]  Where should we start?
[01:16:07.222 --> 01:16:09.122]  Well, thanks Alex.
[01:16:09.723 --> 01:16:12.863]  Listening to you, you're 100% accurate with what you're saying.
[01:16:15.256 --> 01:16:24.462]  Really, it's important for me to point out that my sources are independent of your sources, and the information that I'm getting is certainly lining up with what you're getting.
[01:16:24.522 --> 01:16:26.863]  So, it's really interesting.
[01:16:26.923 --> 01:16:33.508]  Hillary Clinton, as well as the DNC right now, they're in a duck or bleed type scenario.
[01:16:33.908 --> 01:16:39.872]  You've got everything coming out where the globalists are actually being exposed.
[01:16:40.832 --> 01:16:52.442]  They've had plans, of course, many plans, and their plans have gone awry because of the leaks, the exposures, the unintended consequences from the criminality behind the Clinton Foundation.
[01:16:52.482 --> 01:16:57.206]  So all of this together presents a duck or bleed scenario for the globalists.
[01:16:57.346 --> 01:17:03.648]  It's fair to say this, and I'm going to give you the floor, but I'm just so excited, that we're seeing good people in government and other areas stand up.
[01:17:04.088 --> 01:17:09.150]  We're actually seeing the good guys fight back, the good men and women stand up and take action.
[01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:12.451]  Because what I saw at the DNC was unbelievable.
[01:17:12.751 --> 01:17:21.653]  I mean, the police were like 80% awake and were my listeners, and I'm just one guy, and the Secret Service was totally awake.
[01:17:21.793 --> 01:17:22.574]  It was incredible.
[01:17:22.754 --> 01:17:24.214]  That's got to scare the New World Order.
[01:17:24.534 --> 01:17:26.615]  That's got to let them know their plans are going to hell.
[01:17:26.655 --> 01:17:26.935]  Go ahead.
[01:17:27.756 --> 01:17:29.137]  Well, no, you're right.
[01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:31.759]  And I think there's a lot of acrimony right now.
[01:17:31.819 --> 01:17:40.546]  I just spoke a couple of days ago, well over the weekend, with a source I've got once removed from DHS and then one inside the FBI.
[01:17:40.987 --> 01:17:49.654]  There's a lot of acrimony within the FBI because of Bill Clinton's thrashing of the FBI over his wife Hillary and the Clinton Foundation.
[01:17:50.394 --> 01:17:53.337]  That's amazing arrogance to say the FBI Director's full of BS.
[01:17:53.988 --> 01:18:14.609]  Yeah, I mean, so what we're seeing here, I think, is this pushback by the good people within the FBI to declare their name and say, wait a minute, we didn't sign up for this and we certainly didn't agree necessarily with the findings in letting off Hillary Clinton from pursuing criminal charges.
[01:18:15.109 --> 01:18:20.372]  So, all of this combined right now has got them on a track of retreat.
[01:18:20.752 --> 01:18:23.433]  And part of their retreat, I think, we're going to see an October surprise.
[01:18:23.473 --> 01:18:25.074]  And this is the latest information I received.
[01:18:25.574 --> 01:18:34.179]  And that October surprise kind of lines up with what you're saying about the disposition of Hillary Diane Rodham, the Witch Clinton, I call her.
[01:18:35.699 --> 01:18:38.261]  Perhaps we might not see her on the ticket in November.
[01:18:38.381 --> 01:18:41.422]  If not, where's she going to go?
[01:18:41.502 --> 01:18:43.203]  Well, perhaps because of her illness.
[01:18:44.844 --> 01:18:49.147]  Well, this is being talked about by my sources, and apparently by yours.
[01:18:49.668 --> 01:19:09.302]  So, you know, these secret meetings with Soros and Tim Kaine, Soros and others, other globalists, meeting behind closed doors, going to plan B. Now, at the epicenter of this, and I'll just, I'll say this and I'll be quiet, but at the epicenter of this... No, no, no, please, in fact, I'm going to skip this break, last one of the day, go ahead.
[01:19:10.778 --> 01:19:25.169]  I truly believe what we're seeing here with the riots, with the orchestrated riots in Wisconsin and elsewhere by Black Lives Matter and by other groups, by communist groups,
[01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:42.920]  We're seeing at the epicenter of this the attempt to hide the criminality of the Clintons as well as the attempt to hide or perhaps even cause a reason to explain away the economic disaster that's about to fall us.
[01:19:45.141 --> 01:19:48.944]  My sources past weekend, both of them, said think bigger than domestically.
[01:19:49.004 --> 01:19:54.027]  Look at the global situation and factor that into what you see taking place domestically.
[01:19:54.447 --> 01:19:56.649]  We're seeing the pushback from the U.S.
[01:19:56.669 --> 01:19:58.830]  dollar in the petrodollar, that is.
[01:19:59.151 --> 01:20:01.172]  We're seeing that being put aside.
[01:20:01.212 --> 01:20:04.034]  We're seeing Turkey switching sides to go over with Russia.
[01:20:04.334 --> 01:20:14.261]  We're seeing ISIS now, an American CIA-funded cabal, ISIS, that is actually, again, we are
[01:20:15.001 --> 01:20:18.163]  We're finding the wrong side of that, of course, and finding ourselves on the other side of Russia.
[01:20:18.723 --> 01:20:27.648]  We're seeing a dynamic switch of power in the Middle East as well as the Silk Road caucus.
[01:20:28.068 --> 01:20:40.355]  Hillary and Obama have been purposely destroying American power, in Soros' own words, to bring in globalism, but instead all it's doing is discrediting globalism.
[01:20:41.445 --> 01:20:46.447]  Well, right, and I think that's the unintended consequence of what their policies have been.
[01:20:47.047 --> 01:20:53.049]  But, again, I believe at the heart of this is the Keynesian economics, the destruction of the U.S.
[01:20:53.069 --> 01:20:58.371]  petrodollar, and the covering up of the calamity that that will cause.
[01:20:58.811 --> 01:21:03.272]  And that's the riots, the racial division.
[01:21:03.332 --> 01:21:04.713]  And I spoke about this with you back in 2011.
[01:21:04.773 --> 01:21:06.754]  All we've got is the fiat dollar and the petrodollar.
[01:21:06.794 --> 01:21:07.494]  We lose that.
[01:21:07.514 --> 01:21:10.775]  I mean, our industry's gone, our farming's gone.
[01:21:13.354 --> 01:21:14.775]  No foreign army could do this to us.
[01:21:14.835 --> 01:21:16.196]  This is devastating.
[01:21:16.816 --> 01:21:21.760]  Yeah, I mean, this is better, more effective than a foreign invasion.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.221]  But we're seeing the foreign invasion... And that's what Trump's saying.
[01:21:24.281 --> 01:21:26.843]  He's saying these economic policies amount to war.
[01:21:27.503 --> 01:21:27.683]  Right.
[01:21:28.504 --> 01:21:30.265]  And he's absolutely 100% correct.
[01:21:30.705 --> 01:21:32.727]  So, where are we at here?
[01:21:32.767 --> 01:21:33.907]  How do we put all this together?
[01:21:34.608 --> 01:21:35.328]  We're under attack.
[01:21:35.368 --> 01:21:36.529]  George Soros is the head of it.
[01:21:36.549 --> 01:21:37.330]  He needs to be dealt with.
[01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:38.830]  There you go.
[01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:53.274]  We have to think bigger and look at the bigger picture because at the very heart of this is the world economy, is the globalist, and of course, America is the speed bump between the New World Order, shall we say, and the old... Even though it props it up.
[01:21:53.354 --> 01:21:56.435]  It's the schizophrenia of these people, politically and economically and spiritually.
[01:21:56.975 --> 01:21:58.376]  Mr. Hagman, let me ask you this question.
[01:21:59.751 --> 01:22:02.097]  I know there's people above Soros, but he's one of the top kingpins.
[01:22:02.878 --> 01:22:05.804]  Why is this guy so politically bulletproof?
[01:22:05.965 --> 01:22:08.530]  I mean, he is a supervillain supervillain.
[01:22:09.942 --> 01:22:12.463]  Oh, he's had decades and decades of practice at it.
[01:22:12.503 --> 01:22:18.304]  Plus, his contacts, his money buys power.
[01:22:19.025 --> 01:22:21.325]  And of course, he's got no money problems.
[01:22:21.345 --> 01:22:29.107]  So you're looking at this infrastructure, I believe, where he is at the epicenter of his epicenter by way of his billions of dollars.
[01:22:29.307 --> 01:22:29.928]  Oh, I agree.
[01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:30.688]  In fact, here's the key.
[01:22:31.716 --> 01:22:34.679]  It is hundreds of times bigger than Bernie Madoff's scam.
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.882]  He's got all the major world leaders tied into it.
[01:22:37.082 --> 01:22:40.345]  He's too corrupt to fail because he'll bring them all down with him.
[01:22:40.586 --> 01:22:42.488]  And that's why he's so hard to beat.
[01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:44.069]  Because he's corrupted them.
[01:22:44.329 --> 01:22:46.472]  He's gotten so many people involved in corruption.
[01:22:46.832 --> 01:22:48.154]  He's been a Rothschild agent.
[01:22:48.494 --> 01:22:49.995]  He knows where all the bodies are buried.
[01:22:50.296 --> 01:22:52.919]  And so that's why he's such an arrogant sack of crap.
[01:22:54.664 --> 01:22:55.384]  Amen to that.
[01:22:55.765 --> 01:22:56.846]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[01:22:57.206 --> 01:23:05.052]  So, the bottom line here with this, and I was watching your broadcast, running up to my appearance, and I would urge everyone to listen to what you've got to say.
[01:23:05.092 --> 01:23:08.575]  Listen to your sources, because your sources are echoing mine.
[01:23:08.615 --> 01:23:09.656]  We have different sources.
[01:23:09.696 --> 01:23:11.898]  You've got it with the CIA and other agencies.
[01:23:12.058 --> 01:23:14.360]  I've got it with DHS and the FBI.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.722]  So, when you combine these sources,
[01:23:17.262 --> 01:23:23.884]  We're seeing this, and you're right, this is a very dangerous time to be alive, but it's also an exciting time to be alive.
[01:23:25.225 --> 01:23:28.426]  However, we have to expect, I think, the unexpected.
[01:23:28.586 --> 01:23:31.107]  What people are not seeing... Let's talk about that exactly.
[01:23:31.147 --> 01:23:32.367]  What's their plan B curveball?
[01:23:32.387 --> 01:23:33.548]  Because they are floundering right now.
[01:23:34.383 --> 01:23:37.765]  Well, I think they need to retain their power at all costs.
[01:23:38.326 --> 01:23:39.406]  And how are they going to do that?
[01:23:39.526 --> 01:23:44.450]  If they can't do it through Hillary, Dianne Rodham Clinton, then they've got to find some other way of doing it.
[01:23:44.570 --> 01:23:55.637]  But the other way of doing it would be to bring down the entire system, burn down the entire house, the global house, and then restructure it according to their Babylonian plans, if you will.
[01:23:55.717 --> 01:23:57.378]  So that's what I think they're looking at.
[01:23:57.418 --> 01:24:01.161]  They're looking at if we can't win domestically, let's take down the entire house globally.
[01:24:01.821 --> 01:24:08.243]  That would be done with a war, or economics, or together, because we already see that the German banks look like they're going to be the big detonator.
[01:24:09.023 --> 01:24:19.486]  Well, and I think at the center of this, too, is the economic factor, the fragility of the petrodollar, the fact that they want to take down the U.S.
[01:24:19.526 --> 01:24:20.567]  dollar, they want to kill the U.S.
[01:24:20.587 --> 01:24:20.807]  dollar.
[01:24:20.827 --> 01:24:21.827]  They've said that for years.
[01:24:22.207 --> 01:24:23.928]  We've attempted to expose that for years.
[01:24:23.948 --> 01:24:24.868]  That's Soros' admitted goal.
[01:24:25.506 --> 01:24:26.166]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:26.707 --> 01:24:39.115]  And when that happens, we are already losing much of our buying power, which is reflected by the racial and societal acrimony we're seeing here in the United States play out.
[01:24:39.635 --> 01:24:49.122]  So, is what we're seeing with respect to the civil riots and the civil unrest, is that a result of this loss of buying power?
[01:24:49.362 --> 01:24:52.244]  Or is the loss of buying power reflected by the riots?
[01:24:55.626 --> 01:24:57.268]  With the bigger glasses.
[01:24:57.368 --> 01:25:00.051]  Not through a microscope, but through a larger lens here.
[01:25:00.191 --> 01:25:01.893]  And I think once you... I can't see the big picture.
[01:25:01.913 --> 01:25:02.534]  35,000 foot look down.
[01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:06.598]  Do you agree with me or disagree?
[01:25:06.678 --> 01:25:08.380]  I think the New World Order is in deep trouble.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:09.421]  They admit it's in deep trouble.
[01:25:09.441 --> 01:25:14.025]  They have articles in the Financial Times of London and scores of others saying world government's in trouble.
[01:25:14.405 --> 01:25:18.448]  We've got to get Hillary in or everything's going to unravel because of Brexit and now this.
[01:25:18.789 --> 01:25:20.690]  People are learning about diplomatic immunity.
[01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:24.013]  They're learning that big megabanks are immune from prosecution.
[01:25:24.233 --> 01:25:25.594]  They're learning about Soros.
[01:25:25.634 --> 01:25:28.116]  They're learning about how this superclass
[01:25:28.997 --> 01:25:40.700]  Is fomenting all this division around the world and as soon as the public finally understands that down at the grassroots, I don't see how they can ever reverse their political comeuppance.
[01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:47.673]  Well, maybe they can't reverse it, but certainly they can eradicate many of the objectors to the new system.
[01:25:47.994 --> 01:25:50.535]  And, you know, go back to the Georgia Guidestones, for example.
[01:25:51.075 --> 01:25:52.076]  What's the objective there?
[01:25:52.116 --> 01:25:53.217]  To reduce the population.
[01:25:53.437 --> 01:25:54.597]  So they're willing to do anything?
[01:25:54.617 --> 01:25:56.919]  Oh, I have no doubt in my mind.
[01:25:57.099 --> 01:26:08.225]  And my source within the federal government, within the FBI, said, trust me on this, these people are the most vicious, cannibalistic people that you'll ever meet behind closed doors.
[01:26:08.265 --> 01:26:09.646]  And now we're seeing it openly.
[01:26:09.946 --> 01:26:12.047]  Well, let's go back to the FBI director.
[01:26:12.087 --> 01:26:15.149]  I mean, I know for a lot of people that are good people, they say, no, this guy really is good.
[01:26:15.469 --> 01:26:16.350]  He's trying to reform things.
[01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:17.650]  So I give him the benefit of the doubt.
[01:26:18.031 --> 01:26:22.673]  He comes out and for 80% of the speech, you know, a month ago, says she should be indicted.
[01:26:22.693 --> 01:26:23.194]  She's horrible.
[01:26:23.234 --> 01:26:23.694]  She's evil.
[01:26:24.074 --> 01:26:26.135]  But then says, but no prosecutors will do it.
[01:26:26.155 --> 01:26:28.997]  And then I sat back and kind of got angry, but then I thought about it more.
[01:26:30.546 --> 01:26:38.509]  Clearly now there's a war going on between DHS, sectors of DHS and the Justice Department on top, run by Lynch.
[01:26:39.349 --> 01:26:43.710]  And clearly there's leaks coming out from the other agencies trying to expose what's happening.
[01:26:44.691 --> 01:26:47.752]  And so from your sources, who is the FBI director?
[01:26:49.072 --> 01:26:50.353]  And what does he really stand for?
[01:26:50.473 --> 01:26:56.915]  And why did he back down when the word was he really was going to call for Hillary to be indicted?
[01:26:57.759 --> 01:27:10.424]  Well, just based on what I've been hearing, and these are from my sources within the FBI itself, Comey started out very good in terms of his intent, his desires.
[01:27:11.305 --> 01:27:14.666]  The investigation that he conducted was fair.
[01:27:15.486 --> 01:27:20.188]  Fair based on the parameters that they were given, so I'll give that caveat.
[01:27:20.989 --> 01:27:24.770]  They were hogtied from the beginning with certain issues with Hillary Clinton.
[01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:25.791]  They could have put her under oath.
[01:27:25.831 --> 01:27:26.251]  They didn't.
[01:27:27.131 --> 01:27:27.531]  I don't know.
[01:27:42.068 --> 01:27:42.528]  Right, right.
[01:27:42.948 --> 01:27:44.009]  And imagine this, though.
[01:27:44.109 --> 01:27:52.952]  Imagine being the FBI Director recommending criminal charges and then not having them, not having the Justice Department pick up the mantle and say, okay, we're going to pursue this based on your recommendations.
[01:27:53.252 --> 01:28:04.697]  Well, obviously, that would put Comey in a really bad position, not with the, well, not only with the public, the perception of the public, but within his own rank and file, within his people, within the FBI.
[01:28:04.737 --> 01:28:09.279]  What about the new investigations, criminal probes of the State Department?
[01:28:10.179 --> 01:28:14.202]  The foundation where it's been proven that the State Department and the foundation were acting as one.
[01:28:15.063 --> 01:28:22.768]  Well, and there's right now you got three, three independent investigations taking place right now with respect to the foundation.
[01:28:22.828 --> 01:28:23.429]  Three U.S.
[01:28:23.489 --> 01:28:25.750]  attorneys are involved, three separate investigations.
[01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:31.955]  Plus, you've got a subcommittee, a Senate subcommittee about ready to look at this as well.
[01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:37.259]  You've got all of this overlap between the Clinton Foundation, other NGOs, the people within the State Department as well.
[01:28:39.419 --> 01:28:56.944]  If this goes in the direction against Clinton, against Hillary Clinton and Bill and their associates, then this is why they're going to have to do something, I suspect, contrary to the big talkers like Rush Limbaugh and others who say, well, you know, nothing's going to happen.
[01:28:56.964 --> 01:28:57.484]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:28:58.124 --> 01:29:01.628]  Certainly it could happen, especially given the attitude by the FBI.
[01:29:01.688 --> 01:29:18.127]  I'll tell you this, and again I'm not bragging, it was shocking as I've been to a couple DNCs and RNCs, I've been around the Secret Service a bunch, and they do seem generally focused, professional, almost dog-like, you know, in their duty, but state police, local police, other cops they brought in, Secret Service, federal marshals,
[01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:19.448]  I don't know.
[01:29:36.806 --> 01:29:37.886]  We're on the march.
[01:29:37.966 --> 01:29:39.187]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:39.267 --> 01:29:40.607]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.049 --> 01:30:11.970]  Article from the Associated Press.
[01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:20.474]  A Chicago-based communist revolutionary group was blamed by Milwaukee's police chief for stoking a second day of violence.
[01:30:20.934 --> 01:30:29.839]  Police Chief Ed Flynn said members of a Chicago chapter of the revolutionary communist party turned what had been a peaceful night into a tense one.
[01:30:30.299 --> 01:30:34.682]  TV footage showed a small group of protesters walking or running through the streets.
[01:30:34.923 --> 01:30:48.993]  The fatal police shooting of a 23-year-old black man, Savelle Smith, touched off a weekend of tense and at times violent protests that left at least six businesses burned and several officers injured by flying objects Saturday night.
[01:30:49.213 --> 01:30:55.138]  Fourteen people were arrested overnight, and three police officers and four sheriff's deputies were injured.
[01:30:55.774 --> 01:30:58.197]  InfoWars has its team on the ground.
[01:30:58.557 --> 01:31:03.222]  News Director Rob Dew has already filmed communist recruitment signage.
[01:31:03.562 --> 01:31:07.086]  Go to InfoWars.com for breaking news on Milwaukee.
[01:31:09.795 --> 01:31:18.862]  If you can't see the irony in having a gun ban enforced by men with guns, well then you fail to understand why the Second Amendment was written in the first place.
[01:31:18.902 --> 01:31:21.765]  Throughout history, only slaves are disarmed.
[01:31:21.885 --> 01:31:25.628]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[01:31:25.768 --> 01:31:26.869]  The right of the people.
[01:31:26.889 --> 01:31:28.111]  The right of the people.
[01:31:28.171 --> 01:31:29.092]  The right of the people.
[01:31:29.172 --> 01:31:31.595]  To keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[01:31:31.655 --> 01:31:40.505]  For all of you actors out there who go to your red carpet events surrounded by full battle rattle swat teams while you accept your awards for your latest violent movie.
[01:31:40.825 --> 01:31:42.005]  I have a strict gun control policy.
[01:31:42.025 --> 01:31:44.146]  If there's a gun around, I want to control it.
[01:31:44.206 --> 01:31:45.086]  Clint Eastwood.
[01:31:45.126 --> 01:31:45.306]  Go ahead.
[01:31:45.366 --> 01:31:45.946]  Make my day.
[01:31:45.966 --> 01:31:49.027]  Dads demand guns because it's me that's got to get up and go check out that noise at 2am.
[01:32:09.867 --> 01:32:18.896]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:32:18.976 --> 01:32:27.203]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:32:27.384 --> 01:32:32.048]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:32:32.248 --> 01:32:38.971]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:39.031 --> 01:32:46.114]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:32:46.194 --> 01:32:53.077]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:32:53.238 --> 01:32:57.579]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:00.921]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[01:33:07.385 --> 01:33:09.086]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:09.166 --> 01:33:12.289]  We are on the march.
[01:33:14.410 --> 01:33:17.472]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:19.313 --> 01:33:23.036]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:46.925 --> 01:33:51.307]  Obviously, when you talk to different sources, it's dangerous for the source to be giving you info.
[01:33:51.427 --> 01:33:58.170]  They don't try to give you any classified info or, you know, stuff protected by privacy rights or things like that.
[01:33:58.850 --> 01:34:02.251]  It's more like, go read what this guy wrote in this article.
[01:34:02.331 --> 01:34:03.012]  That's dead on.
[01:34:03.935 --> 01:34:06.397]  Or what's your sayings right on?
[01:34:06.437 --> 01:34:07.638]  You need to look into more of this.
[01:34:08.338 --> 01:34:19.706]  But now it's getting to the point of people are in meetings running security and they are hearing unbelievable plots being hatched against Trump.
[01:34:20.826 --> 01:34:22.067]  Stuff where people got to speak out.
[01:34:23.348 --> 01:34:26.650]  Unbelievable plans to like stage an attack on Hillary.
[01:34:27.691 --> 01:34:28.592]  To blame it on Trump.
[01:34:30.453 --> 01:34:33.475]  And then once they've done that, they make Trump look bad, then they can go after Trump.
[01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:42.352]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff that was going on in World War II, like in 1944 in Germany, when folks were not knowing what to do about Hitler.
[01:34:42.372 --> 01:34:45.533]  I mean, some of the government's perfect.
[01:34:45.833 --> 01:34:46.554]  It's certainly not.
[01:34:46.574 --> 01:34:48.754]  The special interests are what are really bad, the globalists.
[01:34:49.155 --> 01:34:55.857]  But the people in the government have now been forced to the point of where they're realizing, oh my gosh,
[01:34:57.930 --> 01:35:00.153]  The patriots that warned about this world government are right.
[01:35:00.293 --> 01:35:01.915]  I mean, George Soros' emails are out.
[01:35:02.155 --> 01:35:03.456]  The DNC emails are out.
[01:35:03.757 --> 01:35:05.098]  There's tens of thousands of them.
[01:35:05.278 --> 01:35:08.402]  Within days of them being out, we've already gotten into the emails.
[01:35:08.422 --> 01:35:13.508]  They're up on InfoWars.com, DrudgeReport.com, from The Daily Caller and others that have dug them up, saying...
[01:35:14.718 --> 01:35:28.026]  We're gonna bring in the migrants and get a bunch of government money to take care of, and then use them as political weapons, and make up the new normal, and merge the Middle East with Europe, and take over the U.S., and use the new immigrant routes as our political voting block, control everything, and call everybody racist and don't go along with it?
[01:35:28.286 --> 01:35:32.128]  I mean, this is a criminal conspiracy, and we have the diary!
[01:35:33.909 --> 01:35:35.030]  It's open and shut!
[01:35:38.071 --> 01:35:39.032]  It's open and shut.
[01:35:40.435 --> 01:35:50.100]  Going back to Mr. Hagman in a moment, we are running a special on one of our top nutraceuticals that is just really an old apothecary recipe.
[01:35:51.041 --> 01:35:59.325]  Every major plant, derivative, herb that's known to clean out the body and flush out parasites, it's living defense.
[01:35:59.905 --> 01:36:07.910]  It sells out for six months a lot of times because we can't get, it's got so many ingredients, you can't get them all totally clean and have them at California levels.
[01:36:08.735 --> 01:36:11.620]  Where, you know, it can't have as much lead as the air has in it.
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:13.523]  So it's a really clean product.
[01:36:13.563 --> 01:36:15.406]  All our products are, because they go to the highest standards.
[01:36:16.388 --> 01:36:18.071]  Or we couldn't sell them in places like California.
[01:36:18.948 --> 01:36:20.249]  That's why it sells out so often.
[01:36:20.329 --> 01:36:21.430]  It's a very popular product.
[01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:23.071]  I think it'll only be sold out a month this time.
[01:36:23.892 --> 01:36:26.154]  I'm still discounting it 20% even though it's about to sell out.
[01:36:26.474 --> 01:36:27.635]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:36:27.955 --> 01:36:29.956]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:36:30.277 --> 01:36:38.303]  Amerageddon is a $5 million budget film produced by Chuck Norris' son, the great patriot, Mike Norris.
[01:36:39.283 --> 01:36:41.145]  Gary Haven funded it.
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:45.922]  And it exposes a fictional New World Order takeover here in the United States.
[01:36:46.403 --> 01:36:55.810]  You get one copy for $19.95, get a second copy for $19.95, $39.90, and get two of my films free, Matrix of Evil and Fall of the Republic.
[01:36:56.310 --> 01:37:01.133]  And it's great to have these in your archive, great to donate them to the local library, great to support this type of work.
[01:37:02.148 --> 01:37:06.251]  Private we make, obviously, funds this operation that you see having such a giant effect.
[01:37:06.271 --> 01:37:07.932]  So thank you for your support, your prayers.
[01:37:08.312 --> 01:37:10.774]  Thanks for shopping with the good guys at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:37:10.814 --> 01:37:12.015]  We're back calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:37:12.075 --> 01:37:29.727]  I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.tv family news members, but I also want to just thank all of you that put up with me a lot of the time and that get the video links, the audio links, the different articles, and that you post them and you spread them because I'm risking my life doing this.
[01:37:30.839 --> 01:37:32.320]  And I'm not doing this to lose.
[01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:33.902]  I know history.
[01:37:34.102 --> 01:37:44.511]  And getting back to the point I asked for the break, Mr. Hagman, who's a wise man, the mainstream globalist media was there, and they wrote about it in scores of publications.
[01:37:44.651 --> 01:37:52.718]  I could care less about having the super elite, beyond backstage passes to the RNC if it was to go see a George Herbert Walker Bush or a Mitt Romney.
[01:37:53.358 --> 01:37:58.223]  But the fact that the Trump people gave us passes that, I mean, literally maybe a hundred people had,
[01:37:59.043 --> 01:38:06.089]  It was in Newsweek, you name it, Jones of the controversy had like, you know, the super level passes, the ace of spades.
[01:38:06.429 --> 01:38:08.891]  Oh my God, this portends how evil Trump is.
[01:38:09.311 --> 01:38:13.454]  Absolutely it portends how horrible Trump is to you and your globalist agenda.
[01:38:13.914 --> 01:38:18.218]  And it shows how fast we can take this country back once people get it and once we have leadership.
[01:38:18.778 --> 01:38:25.123]  Because I'm here to tell you, they want us to have a war with the police because on average the police are more awake than the general public.
[01:38:25.703 --> 01:38:29.987]  They want us to have a civil war with the military because they want to take out their enemies at the same time.
[01:38:30.267 --> 01:38:35.652]  Just like Hillary got caught in the emails confirming what the Chicago police told us and others.
[01:38:37.694 --> 01:38:42.459]  They funded people dressed up like Bernie supporters to attack Trump supporters.
[01:38:42.679 --> 01:38:46.022]  That way you blame Trump for violence and Bernie who looks good.
[01:38:46.162 --> 01:38:47.323]  It's elementary!
[01:38:48.291 --> 01:38:49.051]  My dear Watson.
[01:38:49.692 --> 01:38:50.912]  But we've caught them!
[01:38:51.593 --> 01:38:52.433]  We've caught them!
[01:38:52.773 --> 01:38:54.614]  And people understand this now.
[01:38:54.935 --> 01:38:56.275]  And it's really scaring them.
[01:38:56.515 --> 01:38:57.756]  It's really upsetting them.
[01:38:58.036 --> 01:39:03.839]  And it shows that they want to have a civil war in this country, where you randomly shoot cops in the back of the head.
[01:39:03.899 --> 01:39:06.421]  Some weird leftist communist civil war.
[01:39:06.461 --> 01:39:09.522]  It's not a communist takeover, but it's communism they use at the grassroots.
[01:39:09.542 --> 01:39:11.163]  Just like Milwaukee was communist doing that.
[01:39:12.384 --> 01:39:15.165]  That's how the globalists tend to rob us, is playing us off against each other.
[01:39:15.205 --> 01:39:15.746]  Instead,
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:22.121]  The feds went in 30 years ago and funded militias because they knew it was a constitutional movement.
[01:39:22.141 --> 01:39:23.722]  I'm going to get Hagman's take on this.
[01:39:25.322 --> 01:39:32.084]  Some of them to be violent, to put out bad rhetoric against police and local government because those were natural allies for the police and military.
[01:39:32.104 --> 01:39:35.185]  It was constitutional to brand militia as bad.
[01:39:35.765 --> 01:39:36.886]  See, it's all this branding.
[01:39:37.006 --> 01:39:37.466]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:39:37.686 --> 01:39:39.807]  I'm not going to be branded as if I want to kill cops.
[01:39:40.047 --> 01:39:42.187]  I'm not going to be branded that I'm out to blow things up.
[01:39:42.407 --> 01:39:43.328]  That's the weatherman.
[01:39:43.488 --> 01:39:45.048]  That's the people that advise Obama.
[01:39:45.328 --> 01:39:46.949]  That's all of their people.
[01:39:47.864 --> 01:39:54.746]  That's, you know, the guy pledging his book to Lucifer, rules for radicals, all the rest of this garbage.
[01:39:55.506 --> 01:39:57.007]  These people mean business, folks.
[01:39:57.607 --> 01:39:58.407]  They have a plan.
[01:39:58.447 --> 01:39:59.307]  We know their plan.
[01:39:59.767 --> 01:40:06.549]  And so when I get the emails, see the comments, oh, you're just a cop worshipper, blah, blah, blah, that's ridiculous.
[01:40:06.689 --> 01:40:12.511]  I'm for good police, just like I'm for good judges, or good school teachers, or good farmers, or good, you know,
[01:40:13.576 --> 01:40:14.077]  Engineers.
[01:40:14.898 --> 01:40:28.151]  I judge people individually, and I want my republic, and I can see a foreign, outside, globalist move to overthrow our country, and I can see them do it in other nations, and I'm resisting it because I'm an American, and this is my republic!
[01:40:29.573 --> 01:40:34.818]  And they call Russia draconian for kicking the George Soros foundations out of their country.
[01:40:35.788 --> 01:40:38.530]  And kicking his people out of the country when they catch him landing in the nation.
[01:40:38.711 --> 01:40:41.073]  When Soros admits he's trying to overthrow Russia right now.
[01:40:41.853 --> 01:40:44.916]  I'm surprised Russia isn't arresting those people that fly in.
[01:40:45.136 --> 01:40:46.938]  Those are foreign corporate agencies.
[01:40:47.098 --> 01:40:49.920]  We always think of Russian agents or American agents or Chinese agents.
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:50.801]  And that goes on.
[01:40:51.221 --> 01:40:57.467]  But corporations and global banks have their own intelligence agencies and they're playing us off against each other.
[01:40:57.687 --> 01:40:58.307]  Now I'm ranting.
[01:40:58.327 --> 01:40:59.889]  I'm giving you the floor, Mr. Hagman.
[01:40:59.909 --> 01:41:01.890]  Get into other facets of this.
[01:41:03.452 --> 01:41:08.857]  Do you think I'm right about how awake the police and military are and Black Lives Matter?
[01:41:09.338 --> 01:41:11.260]  What are they going to try running this up to the election?
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.020]  Where do we go from here?
[01:41:12.621 --> 01:41:17.085]  Well, you know, I think you're 100% accurate, everything that you've said.
[01:41:17.105 --> 01:41:25.834]  And the more I see and the more I talk to my police sources, especially on the local level, the county level, the state level as well.
[01:41:27.011 --> 01:41:35.820]  They're sick and tired of being used as pawns in the game, in the larger game here, the political game that we see taking place in the United States.
[01:41:36.567 --> 01:41:47.735]  Now, having said that, I've got to just reaffirm the Saul Alinsky playbook that you talked about, Rules for Radicals.
[01:41:48.115 --> 01:42:01.224]  You know, May 2nd, 1969, Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton wrote her senior thesis on that Rules for Radicals, on Saul Alinsky's ideological concept of just burning everything down.
[01:42:01.824 --> 01:42:03.725]  And she's implementing that, or attempting to.
[01:42:03.765 --> 01:42:04.525]  And she pen-palled him!
[01:42:04.585 --> 01:42:05.286]  She pen-palled him!
[01:42:05.306 --> 01:42:06.906]  Yeah, very much, yes, yes.
[01:42:07.227 --> 01:42:17.692]  And of course, the Clare Piven strategy that we've seen, which pigtails onto, or hooks onto the Keynesian economics that we're seeing here in the United States.
[01:42:17.872 --> 01:42:30.017]  All of this combined is working toward the destruction of our constitutional republic, which you have done much to expose and to restore and to maintain the constitutional republic, which is what we're attempting to do as well.
[01:42:30.057 --> 01:42:30.938]  So having said all of that,
[01:42:31.218 --> 01:42:33.781]  You're dead on accurate with respect to what's taking place.
[01:42:35.002 --> 01:42:36.683]  I do believe that 100%.
[01:42:36.723 --> 01:42:53.300]  Now, where we're at right now, I do believe, is a situation where they're going to pull something, and this is based on the weight of my sources as well, they're going to do something ahead of the elections in November to ensure
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:43:03.044]  At least in their mind to ensure their plans for world domination and domination of the West and specifically the United States goes forward.
[01:43:03.465 --> 01:43:07.947]  Whether that means sacrificing Hillary as much as that sounds incredible!
[01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:20.936]  If they've got to move Hillary out of the way a tad, knowing that she'll never go to jail for any of this, but certainly might be taken out of the game, they may do that, or whatever the case might be.
[01:43:21.397 --> 01:43:27.320]  But what we're seeing here is political theater to cover the actions of the globalists here in the United States.
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:34.765]  So you're 100% accurate, and yes, I will say the police, and I love what you said because I get a lot of email as well.
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.985]  I'm a police officer in Maryland or whatever.
[01:43:41.585 --> 01:43:44.127]  Give my best to Alex when you talk to him tomorrow.
[01:43:44.188 --> 01:43:46.109]  So, you know, we get a lot of these as well.
[01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:50.093]  So the rank and file of the police want to do the right thing.
[01:43:50.573 --> 01:43:52.175]  They're being federalized at the top.
[01:43:52.675 --> 01:44:02.123]  They understand what's going on, but the majority of the people who are actually on the streets having guns pointed at them are in fact supporters of yours and ours and the supporters of the people that
[01:44:03.284 --> 01:44:04.385]  What else is on the radar?
[01:44:28.103 --> 01:44:33.067]  Well, the economic, again, the petrodollar is really a big thing.
[01:44:35.069 --> 01:44:48.801]  That's what Russia did in the agreement with Iran, and now Turkey switching sides from NATO to Russia, more of a Russia-China alliance, snubbing the US out of this.
[01:44:50.883 --> 01:44:52.864]  Using anything but the U.S.
[01:44:52.904 --> 01:44:55.286]  dollar, that really has put us on the ropes.
[01:44:55.946 --> 01:45:05.893]  And the situation in Syria, the situation in Crimea, Ukraine, all of this combined, these are all global chess moves by the globalists.
[01:45:06.453 --> 01:45:13.297]  But, again, now everything that happens here in the United States, in particular the elections, who's going to be the next U.S.
[01:45:13.317 --> 01:45:17.240]  president, of course, we have to look at all of this.
[01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:33.015]  We have to look at the elections, I should say, against that backdrop, against the backdrop of what's taking place globally, because everything is on a global level, and what happens on a local, state, and federal level, of course, is a microcosm of the globalist agenda.
[01:45:33.595 --> 01:45:35.656]  Doug Hagman of hagmanandhagman.com.
[01:45:38.097 --> 01:45:41.418]  Looking at this, and I want to have Joe Biggs pop in here with some breaking news.
[01:45:41.458 --> 01:45:43.659]  He's in Milwaukee right now covering the situation up there.
[01:45:46.158 --> 01:45:52.963]  We see these times historically when all these major political realignments happen, where all these wars happen, where sides start flipping sides.
[01:45:54.204 --> 01:46:02.671]  Most historians agree with us that we're at the most critical juncture in history and that we see similar things that happened before World War I and World War II.
[01:46:05.593 --> 01:46:10.456]  And that the world is hurtling towards major economic collapse and warfare.
[01:46:10.476 --> 01:46:13.599]  And then meanwhile we have Soros and others trying to stir up collapses.
[01:46:15.273 --> 01:46:17.058]  All over the place to consolidate control.
[01:46:17.078 --> 01:46:23.535]  Do you think these people are crazy enough to go ahead with this plan, even though it looks like they're not in a good position?
[01:46:24.264 --> 01:46:24.464]  Sure.
[01:46:25.464 --> 01:46:26.384]  I have no doubt in my mind.
[01:46:26.404 --> 01:46:38.487]  As you had said, you had described the information you received from your sources, where there's security, these people are openly talking about their criminality, their criminal plans, the cabals of lawlessness.
[01:46:38.527 --> 01:46:49.249]  I mean, look at the lawlessness that we're seeing today here in this country, where you can't get a conviction or even interest in opening an investigation when there's evidence.
[01:46:49.749 --> 01:46:51.589]  Look at Hillary, it's just everywhere.
[01:46:52.369 --> 01:46:53.209]  Yeah.
[01:46:53.269 --> 01:46:55.571]  That's why they're so arrogant, because they know they have the Justice Department.
[01:46:56.551 --> 01:46:57.111]  Right, right.
[01:46:57.232 --> 01:47:00.593]  But they don't want to lose that, and they can see losing that.
[01:47:00.613 --> 01:47:02.754]  They can see the writing on the wall.
[01:47:02.794 --> 01:47:04.896]  That's why they're pitching the polls.
[01:47:04.916 --> 01:47:11.659]  They're saying, oh, well, Donald Trump is behind, and they're going to do whatever they can to negate.
[01:47:11.859 --> 01:47:13.520]  So this is all or nothing on both sides.
[01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:14.380]  I mean, this is it.
[01:47:15.965 --> 01:47:20.649]  To me, based on everything I've heard, Alex, this is for all the marbles, as I like to say.
[01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:24.593]  This is the final throes for this domination.
[01:47:25.153 --> 01:47:30.157]  And people say, well, that's kind of, oh man, don't say that because that's causing fear.
[01:47:30.558 --> 01:47:31.939]  No, I mean, I think it's just reality.
[01:47:31.979 --> 01:47:33.861]  I think that now is the hinge moment.
[01:47:33.881 --> 01:47:40.626]  Look, when the Secret Service are out in the middle of the cameras and the lights and everywhere shaking my hand and stuff, I mean, they've never been like that.
[01:47:40.907 --> 01:47:42.168]  You know that they don't care anymore.
[01:47:42.668 --> 01:47:43.048]  That's right.
[01:47:43.249 --> 01:47:45.050]  And of course, I'm told that across agencies.
[01:47:45.610 --> 01:47:47.452]  People are ready for them to steal the election.
[01:47:47.692 --> 01:47:49.614]  They're ready for the globalists to make their next move.
[01:47:49.874 --> 01:47:51.455]  And the military and police are just ready now.
[01:47:51.515 --> 01:47:54.017]  I think that the establishment's really miscalculated.
[01:47:54.037 --> 01:47:55.919]  I think it's moved to the point people don't care anymore.
[01:47:56.159 --> 01:47:58.141]  And they took everybody's restraint for weakness, Doug.
[01:47:59.288 --> 01:48:00.489]  Yeah, yeah, and that's right.
[01:48:00.769 --> 01:48:10.992]  Our silence for apathy, our tolerance for acceptance, I think that they're seeing now that they've miscalculated, perhaps.
[01:48:11.533 --> 01:48:21.356]  And another area of concern that I have, I'm just going to toss this out there too, and you wrote about this on your website, Infowars.com, is the ISIS presence in Mexico.
[01:48:21.916 --> 01:48:28.619]  According to my sources, the importation of ISIS elements into the United States
[01:48:29.099 --> 01:48:32.542]  Has been going at full speed for the last three years.
[01:48:32.562 --> 01:48:40.848]  And by the way, let's cover that now because I'm getting Joe Biggs on about our source and more information on Hillary Self from the Secret Service.
[01:48:41.209 --> 01:48:43.150]  But since you mentioned that, we're about to go to break in a moment.
[01:48:43.170 --> 01:48:44.651]  I want to come back with that, Mr. Hagman.
[01:48:45.232 --> 01:48:48.775]  Biggs went down there off the judicial watch memos.
[01:48:50.512 --> 01:48:53.114]  And confirm the mosque, confirm the Islamists is going on.
[01:48:53.134 --> 01:48:55.075]  The FBI said no one even dares go in that area.
[01:48:55.295 --> 01:48:56.716]  It's the most dangerous area in Mexico.
[01:48:56.756 --> 01:48:59.178]  The movie Sicaria is basically about that area.
[01:48:59.438 --> 01:49:01.400]  You know, there's firefights and tracers every night.
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:06.663]  The FBI met with Biggs on record at the airport and said, you know, thank you for information.
[01:49:07.944 --> 01:49:11.445]  And then basically debriefed him and said, yes, we know this is going on.
[01:49:11.485 --> 01:49:13.946]  It's very credible, but we're basically not allowed to talk about it.
[01:49:14.146 --> 01:49:17.166]  So let's bring Joe Biggs in to briefly talk about that from Milwaukee.
[01:49:17.186 --> 01:49:18.027]  He's on the phone right now.
[01:49:18.047 --> 01:49:19.967]  He'll be joining us on video later.
[01:49:20.427 --> 01:49:20.867]  Joe Biggs.
[01:49:21.447 --> 01:49:22.208]  There is video now.
[01:49:22.228 --> 01:49:22.628]  Go ahead, Joe.
[01:49:23.728 --> 01:49:25.468]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[01:49:25.489 --> 01:49:27.309]  We're actually standing right across from where the...
[01:49:27.722 --> 01:49:28.182]  Thank you.
[01:49:46.537 --> 01:49:47.057]  Mexico.
[01:49:47.097 --> 01:49:49.819]  Yeah, that's something we started covering over a year ago.
[01:49:49.899 --> 01:49:56.122]  We had these reports from Judicial Watch that said that there was possibly an ISIS base operating in the Annapurna area.
[01:49:56.422 --> 01:49:58.403]  Now that is just south of El Paso, Texas.
[01:49:58.683 --> 01:50:08.708]  You cross over into Ciudad Juarez and then you head west about 10 miles into a town called Annapurna and it's mostly run by cartels and we initially came out with our reports
[01:50:09.188 --> 01:50:17.754]  We were saying that there's a good possibility that cartels could be helping out these ISIS jihadis and smuggling them across the board because they're very familiar with that area.
[01:50:18.014 --> 01:50:21.836]  And people mocked us and said that no, there's no way that cartels would help out.
[01:50:21.876 --> 01:50:25.659]  Now we have ISIS guys who've been captured here in the U.S.
[01:50:25.959 --> 01:50:36.526]  who have actually come out and said yes, they have brothers down there in Mexico that are waiting and they're using the cartels to smuggle these guys in and they're waiting to carry out attacks in Arizona and in Texas.
[01:50:37.335 --> 01:50:40.297]  And the question is, why is the Border Patrol being ordered to stand down?
[01:50:40.337 --> 01:50:42.298]  Why wouldn't they at least stop ISIS-type people?
[01:50:42.358 --> 01:50:47.260]  It just seems like a total disregard and just don't care, just like the diseases coming across.
[01:50:47.541 --> 01:50:49.982]  Why not test them and treat people for TB and then let them in?
[01:50:50.222 --> 01:50:51.643]  Why just let them come in with TB?
[01:50:52.023 --> 01:50:53.524]  Joe Biggs, we'll answer that later.
[01:50:53.544 --> 01:51:00.928]  I want to come back with you and Mr. Hagman and get into more intel you got last night from our pipeline to the Secret Service.
[01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:03.051]  on Hillary's health.
[01:51:03.431 --> 01:51:03.912]  We'll be back.
[01:51:04.032 --> 01:51:04.793]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:05.314 --> 01:51:08.098]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are our main sites.
[01:51:08.399 --> 01:51:08.779]  Stay with us.
[01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:11.811]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[01:51:11.851 --> 01:51:12.931]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:51:13.191 --> 01:51:14.112]  Why is this show good?
[01:51:14.392 --> 01:51:19.633]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:51:19.734 --> 01:51:33.278]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:51:33.338 --> 01:51:34.719]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:51:35.619 --> 01:51:39.621]  Spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:51:39.721 --> 01:51:40.982]  These are all parasites.
[01:51:41.042 --> 01:51:42.122]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:51:42.142 --> 01:51:43.203]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:51:43.483 --> 01:51:50.106]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, you have enzyme blend in there.
[01:51:50.126 --> 01:51:58.070]  This is very important because a lot of these microorganisms and even going up to tapeworms, pinworms, you have to disintegrate the lining.
[01:51:58.090 --> 01:51:59.271]  I mean on viruses are
[01:51:59.431 --> 01:52:03.093]  Protect themselves and so do bacteria and protozoa and mycoplasms.
[01:52:03.473 --> 01:52:07.715]  They have a protective shell that a lot of times the immune system can't even get into.
[01:52:07.915 --> 01:52:08.956]  Our own immune system.
[01:52:09.516 --> 01:52:12.257]  Especially since most people's immune system are weak anyway.
[01:52:12.958 --> 01:52:23.843]  So we actually design the living defense and put in a specific blend of enzymes which actually chew and eat through the lining of these different organisms.
[01:52:24.383 --> 01:52:26.046]  So the Living Defense is amazing.
[01:52:26.306 --> 01:52:28.570]  We've seen just tremendous reviews.
[01:52:29.231 --> 01:52:31.394]  How often should you take Living Defense?
[01:52:31.494 --> 01:52:32.796]  I mean, is it a regimen every day?
[01:52:32.836 --> 01:52:34.659]  That's what I was doing until we ran out.
[01:52:34.999 --> 01:52:36.722]  Or do you do it heavier for certain cleanses?
[01:52:36.742 --> 01:52:37.543]  What do you do, Dr. Group?
[01:52:38.243 --> 01:52:49.855]  Well, I do usually six weeks at a time, because if you look at the life cycle of most parasites, it's six weeks from the time... So you've got to kill the ones that are in there and then kill their babies when the eggs hatch up.
[01:52:50.135 --> 01:53:00.026]  If you're suffering from abdominal pain, allergies, even like headaches, anemia, weakened immune system, gut problems, depression, hair loss,
[01:53:01.086 --> 01:53:03.567]  Excess gas, muscle pain, nervousness.
[01:53:03.627 --> 01:53:04.687]  I mean, all these things.
[01:53:04.947 --> 01:53:06.047]  Doctors don't know.
[01:53:06.127 --> 01:53:09.748]  They don't teach doctors in medical school about parasites and harmful organisms.
[01:53:09.788 --> 01:53:11.928]  There's a reason why they don't teach them about that.
[01:53:12.008 --> 01:53:17.969]  Just like they don't teach doctors about the root cause of disease and how to eliminate all disease out there.
[01:53:18.029 --> 01:53:19.409]  They don't want you to know about it.
[01:53:19.689 --> 01:53:22.390]  You don't want your own immune system being attacked.
[01:53:22.650 --> 01:53:26.050]  Again, you know, you have animals, especially your cats, dogs.
[01:53:26.070 --> 01:53:27.931]  So many people have pets these days.
[01:53:28.411 --> 01:53:29.731]  People eat raw sushi.
[01:53:30.211 --> 01:53:31.833]  People eat more raw food.
[01:53:31.873 --> 01:53:36.098]  You have all these different organisms showing up in the water supplies now.
[01:53:36.578 --> 01:53:39.922]  You even have it in the air supplies, these tiny microorganisms.
[01:53:39.962 --> 01:53:42.806]  So it's not like we can get away from them.
[01:53:42.866 --> 01:53:44.327]  We just have to do everything.
[01:53:44.408 --> 01:53:45.889]  I recommend doing a parasite
[01:53:46.810 --> 01:53:51.276]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in, because I'm going back on it today.
[01:53:51.316 --> 01:53:52.297]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:53:52.357 --> 01:53:54.240]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:55.321]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:53:55.341 --> 01:53:57.424]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:53:58.064 --> 01:53:59.927]  And you support the broadcast.
[01:53:59.987 --> 01:54:01.068]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:54:01.348 --> 01:54:03.231]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:54:03.611 --> 01:54:05.574]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:54:12.973 --> 01:54:18.995]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:54:19.616 --> 01:54:22.597]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:23.217 --> 01:54:25.318]  America has been occupied by globalists.
[01:54:26.038 --> 01:54:27.138]  They take over by stealth.
[01:54:28.199 --> 01:54:34.781]  They want us all to fight with each other instead of understand that we've been basically invaded by a new type of paramilitary system.
[01:54:36.582 --> 01:54:38.683]  But the good news is the word is spreading.
[01:54:39.738 --> 01:54:41.258]  To really dizzying levels now.
[01:54:42.179 --> 01:54:43.799]  I would call this the Great Awakening right now.
[01:54:44.419 --> 01:54:47.360]  Now we still face incredible challenges and this is our darkest hour.
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:51.321]  But through this storm, I can see the sun ahead.
[01:54:53.321 --> 01:54:55.302]  Mr. Hagman will be with us 20 minutes, 30 minutes, the next hour.
[01:54:55.322 --> 01:54:56.282]  We're going to open the phones up.
[01:54:56.762 --> 01:55:00.323]  Then my reporters are going to pop back in from Milwaukee after that.
[01:55:00.403 --> 01:55:07.205]  But Biggs, notice we broke the big leak news on Sunday with the Secret Service.
[01:55:08.587 --> 01:55:10.890]  Of course, people know we've got a lot of big leaks over the years.
[01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:14.714]  We've broken thousands of big stories, hundreds of number one stories.
[01:55:15.655 --> 01:55:18.739]  We're in the top 100 of news websites in the world, judges number one.
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:20.881]  We reach 28 million people a week.
[01:55:21.582 --> 01:55:24.605]  The media knows it's real, or they would have tried to debunk it.
[01:55:24.866 --> 01:55:29.111]  Total silence on that bombshell, Joe Biggs.
[01:55:30.578 --> 01:55:54.092]  Well, some of the new revelations that I've received over the last 24 hours from my contact within the Secret Service, he pretty much laid out the fact that if you look at these other high-vis, what I mean by that is a high-visibility candidate, you know, politician, a diplomat, someone like that, when they move in motorcades, they usually have to set aside a certain amount of police officers, i.e.
[01:55:54.453 --> 01:55:58.095]  on motorcycles and in vehicles when they go to a certain city.
[01:55:58.315 --> 01:55:59.936]  So when Hillary Clinton comes in to, say,
[01:56:00.876 --> 01:56:02.298]  Philadelphia, like she did today.
[01:56:02.818 --> 01:56:13.088]  They're supposed to set aside two squad cars and a number of motorcycles that can pull ahead, stop the traffic at those four ways to allow that motorcade to zip through as fast as possible.
[01:56:13.389 --> 01:56:19.715]  But due to her, uh, you know, falling health or failing health, she's not able to go through all that, that, that high speed process.
[01:56:20.035 --> 01:56:23.676]  And what they're doing is they're telling these police officers to stand down.
[01:56:23.996 --> 01:56:31.498]  So now you have a motorcade with a lot of high-ranking people within our government, and you have secret services that don't have that protection.
[01:56:31.798 --> 01:56:39.680]  And now they have to stop at each red light, which is putting lives in danger in case someone wants to attack her or commit some kind of crime against her.
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:44.062]  That's putting lives in danger because she can't handle the lights going by.
[01:56:44.122 --> 01:56:45.722]  So that's something that's very dangerous.
[01:56:45.742 --> 01:56:53.307]  And to be clear, they're not giving us secret medical information, they're not giving us documents, they're just pointing out things that we can then observe that are public knowledge.
[01:56:54.487 --> 01:57:13.839]  Yes, I also have a guy that's going to be in Philadelphia today, and then there's going to be another rally coming up in Cleveland, I believe, where I'm going to have some guys that are going to try to catch her motorcade and get that footage to show us how there's a stand down of the police to help get those people to and from their... Also show the handicap ramps that lower down from the bottom of the vehicle.
[01:57:14.417 --> 01:57:14.877]  Exactly.
[01:57:15.438 --> 01:57:26.568]  So you've got other information from another military source that concurs with my sources about other stuff that's so unbelievable we're gonna just have to develop that and cover that when you get back.
[01:57:27.389 --> 01:57:28.750]  Okay.
[01:57:29.771 --> 01:57:30.852]  Other tidbits Joe Biggs.
[01:57:31.650 --> 01:57:37.735]  Well, the interesting thing is, if we take a step back and look at the broader picture of what's going on, you have these leaks coming out.
[01:57:37.975 --> 01:57:43.820]  It's almost like there's this internal coup that's now been created almost by this new patriot movement.
[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:47.282]  The fact that Donald Trump has his popular vote- I'd call it countercoup.
[01:57:47.382 --> 01:57:47.843]  Countercoup.
[01:57:48.447 --> 01:57:54.608]  Well yeah, but what it is though is the fact that there's so many people that have been working in the government that felt like they've had no voice.
[01:57:54.648 --> 01:57:57.789]  They felt like they haven't had an opportunity to expose corruption.
[01:57:57.829 --> 01:58:03.070]  I think people see light knowing that if Donald Trump gets elected, we can get out these bad people.
[01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:08.631]  And that's why you see these revelations, that's why you see these people coming out with this information, these hacks and things like that.
[01:58:08.911 --> 01:58:11.492]  I think it's good and it's scaring the elite and that's why
[01:58:11.932 --> 01:58:20.415]  When I get back to Austin, you and I are going to talk about a lot of this information that we've both gotten, and it's really going to open up a lot of eyes and expose and show what's going on.
[01:58:20.435 --> 01:58:20.755]  That's right.
[01:58:20.775 --> 01:58:33.580]  What happens is the Secret Service and others see us with the top link over the weekend on Drudge, and they see that we're willing to put stuff out, and that's why we got the Homeland Security documents seven years ago that say veterans and gun owners are the number one enemy.
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:35.821]  And by the way, Joe, you're technically right.
[01:58:36.001 --> 01:58:40.664]  The government is Clinton or Obama right now.
[01:58:40.704 --> 01:58:43.186]  So we'd say it's a coup because they're not following him.
[01:58:43.206 --> 01:58:45.607]  But these are hijackers, so I call it a countercoup.
[01:58:45.647 --> 01:58:46.748]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:58:46.788 --> 01:58:49.930]  We are in the middle of the resistance against the foreign occupation.
[01:58:50.210 --> 01:58:51.230]  It's happening, people.
[01:58:51.631 --> 01:58:52.331]  It's happening.
[01:58:52.771 --> 01:58:54.452]  But the enemy will strike back.
[01:58:55.153 --> 01:58:55.553]  Get ready.
[01:58:55.573 --> 01:58:58.935]  I'm going to come back to Joe, finish up, and then to Mr. Hagman and your phone calls.
[01:59:00.766 --> 01:59:02.667]  Article from the Associated Press.
[01:59:02.927 --> 01:59:11.172]  A Chicago-based communist revolutionary group was blamed by Milwaukee's police chief for stoking a second day of violence.
[01:59:11.652 --> 01:59:20.598]  Police Chief Ed Flynn said members of a Chicago chapter of the revolutionary communist party turned what had been a peaceful night into a tense one.
[01:59:21.018 --> 01:59:25.420]  TV footage showed a small group of protesters walking or running through the streets.
[01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:29.843]  The fatal police shooting of a 23-year-old black man, Savelle Smith,
[01:59:30.103 --> 01:59:39.706]  ...touched off a weekend of tense and at times violent protests that left at least six businesses burned and several officers injured by flying objects Saturday night.
[01:59:39.906 --> 01:59:45.868]  Fourteen people were arrested overnight and three police officers and four sheriff's deputies were injured.
[01:59:46.488 --> 01:59:48.909]  InfoWars has its team on the ground.
[01:59:49.269 --> 01:59:53.931]  News director Rob Dew has already filmed communist recruitment signage.
[01:59:54.271 --> 01:59:57.792]  Go to InfoWars.com for breaking news on Milwaukee.
[02:00:02.478 --> 02:00:05.239]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.261 --> 02:00:15.002]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:00:15.022 --> 02:00:21.864]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:21.904 --> 02:00:24.985]  It's epic music, because this is an epic broadcast.
[02:00:27.190 --> 02:00:36.640]  And I am just so honored to be amongst the other men and women of every race, color, and creed who have the light of liberty in their eyes, and who have red blood, and who desire freedom.
[02:00:38.234 --> 02:00:40.896]  America is a great jewel, hijacked by globalists.
[02:00:40.936 --> 02:00:45.679]  They've used our great nation's treasure and ingenuity and will to build a planetary government.
[02:00:46.379 --> 02:00:50.242]  Now they wish to shut down what's left of the republic and enslave us once and for all.
[02:00:50.302 --> 02:00:51.223]  And I got news for them.
[02:00:51.803 --> 02:00:52.944]  We've only begun to fight.
[02:00:52.984 --> 02:00:56.906]  And all over Europe and all over the world, people are seceding, they're pulling out, they're saying no.
[02:00:57.587 --> 02:00:59.268]  Globalism is in great crisis.
[02:00:59.288 --> 02:01:01.850]  I know they bought off the churches the last 200 years and told everybody that
[02:01:02.370 --> 02:01:03.431]  You know, it's the end of the world.
[02:01:03.651 --> 02:01:09.834]  Evil can't be beaten, but truth is, evil will be beaten until it's God's time to let it out of the box one more time.
[02:01:10.535 --> 02:01:13.676]  Going back to Mr. Hagman, he's going to stay with us the rest of the hour to take your phone calls.
[02:01:13.716 --> 02:01:16.017]  Our reporters are going to be popping in at the bottom of the hour.
[02:01:16.678 --> 02:01:19.359]  But just hearing what Joe Biggs was saying, I'm going to get a final comment from him.
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:22.321]  But Doug, really, he crystallized it.
[02:01:22.381 --> 02:01:24.402]  This is a coup, a counter coup, whatever you want to call it.
[02:01:24.842 --> 02:01:27.224]  This is called the death throes of the republic.
[02:01:27.244 --> 02:01:27.904]  Well, I don't think it's that.
[02:01:27.944 --> 02:01:31.146]  I think it's the reawakening of the sleeping giant to know
[02:01:32.481 --> 02:01:46.828]  That the most awake, I cannot hammer this enough, the most awake people are the police, are the military, that the globalists count on to enforce all this, and the fact that they've been persecuting them to try to intimidate them into line, they miscalculated like Tokyo Rose.
[02:01:47.188 --> 02:01:52.511]  The intimidation didn't work, it only pissed them off, and so they've just been calculating the best way to stand up against this.
[02:01:52.531 --> 02:01:53.852]  Is that a fair way to say it?
[02:01:54.557 --> 02:01:58.782]  Yeah, I think so, and I think neither one is really mutually exclusive.
[02:01:58.822 --> 02:02:08.494]  I think that we're seeing a coup, the counter coup, and perhaps some of this, to some extent, Alex, maybe it was, there was a plan, much like
[02:02:11.577 --> 02:02:12.298]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:02:26.969 --> 02:02:27.129]  Yeah.
[02:02:27.529 --> 02:02:31.431]  So, yeah, I mean, I think in general, yeah, you're absolutely 100% correct.
[02:02:31.491 --> 02:02:39.615]  And I'm amazed at the information that you're developing that seems to substantiate what we're getting as well.
[02:02:39.695 --> 02:02:44.117]  So it does seem like there's this awakening taking place, and I hope it continues.
[02:02:44.817 --> 02:02:48.359]  But what are they going to counter with, I suppose, is my question.
[02:02:48.379 --> 02:02:49.159]  That's the big question.
[02:02:49.179 --> 02:02:50.740]  We're going to talk about that after the break.
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.641]  Joe Biggs, what do you think they're going to try to counter with?
[02:02:53.336 --> 02:02:54.837]  Well, it's the force awakens.
[02:02:54.957 --> 02:02:55.598]  Think about this.
[02:02:55.658 --> 02:03:09.168]  We have this force that has been the government and you had this dark side that's dominated for so long and now we have this potential presidential candidate that can really come out and shine through and a lot of these people are now the light side of the force.
[02:03:09.489 --> 02:03:12.331]  It's coming out and seeing this and they're starting to expose a lot of things.
[02:03:12.671 --> 02:03:16.854]  They're coming out, the email I got last night from Homeland Security, the Department of
[02:03:19.316 --> 02:03:19.957]  I can't think of right now.
[02:03:20.057 --> 02:03:27.361]  OGA, all these different entities emailed me last night with different information confirming what it is we've been talking about the past few days.
[02:03:27.761 --> 02:03:35.005]  There's a great awakening happening and everyone is now seeing that there's finally a chance that they can come out without being persecuted.
[02:03:35.225 --> 02:03:36.286]  They have a voice now.
[02:03:36.446 --> 02:03:38.867]  Everybody has to move at once, then they can't get us all.
[02:03:39.367 --> 02:03:40.348]  Yes, we need to come out.
[02:03:40.388 --> 02:03:41.609]  We need to come out with this information.
[02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:43.750]  Mass wave information warfare attacks.
[02:03:44.667 --> 02:03:45.108]  Roger that.
[02:03:45.469 --> 02:03:47.593]  Well, hey, I want to salute the folks that hacked the Democrats.
[02:03:47.613 --> 02:03:48.114]  They're criminals.
[02:03:48.414 --> 02:03:50.017]  I want to salute the folks that hacked Soros.
[02:03:50.438 --> 02:03:52.602]  I mean, and listen, this is only the beginning.
[02:03:53.404 --> 02:03:55.067]  It's only the beginning, isn't it, Joe?
[02:03:55.976 --> 02:03:57.117]  Oh, this is only the beginning.
[02:03:57.217 --> 02:04:03.482]  The information I'm getting every day, I'm getting data dumps, people sending me stuff, just waves of information coming through.
[02:04:04.162 --> 02:04:12.188]  Now that we've come out with this information on Sunday about Hillary Clinton with the Secret Service, more and more departments, more and more people I know are reaching out with information.
[02:04:12.488 --> 02:04:13.609]  They want this to come to an end.
[02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:15.611]  Most people do not want Hillary Clinton.
[02:04:15.631 --> 02:04:17.132]  That's like in the 90 percentile.
[02:04:17.512 --> 02:04:18.253]  Everyone wants
[02:04:19.514 --> 02:04:27.960]  I mean, we got a weirdo Nazi collaborator trying to get people to go out and burn stuff and shoot police.
[02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:28.781]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:04:28.801 --> 02:04:31.643]  Alright, Joe Biggs, we'll talk to you and the rest of the crew.
[02:04:31.663 --> 02:04:33.304]  We'll talk to Rob Dewey and Jakari Jackson.
[02:04:33.525 --> 02:04:34.145]  Jakari first.
[02:04:35.765 --> 02:04:40.608]  We got the Trump rally tonight too at 7.30 that's going to be in West Bend, just above Milwaukee.
[02:04:40.628 --> 02:04:42.049]  So we'll be there tonight covering that as well.
[02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.470]  Great, good.
[02:04:42.490 --> 02:04:44.071]  So we'll have some live coverage on the nightly news.
[02:04:44.111 --> 02:04:44.711]  Great job, crew.
[02:04:44.731 --> 02:04:45.612]  We'll talk to you in 30 minutes.
[02:04:46.212 --> 02:04:47.553]  All right, Jakari Jackson coming up in 30 minutes.
[02:04:47.593 --> 02:04:50.415]  We're going to take your phone calls and talk to Doug Hagman straight ahead.
[02:04:50.455 --> 02:04:53.397]  He's going to ride shotgun with us and co-host for the rest of the hour.
[02:04:53.417 --> 02:04:57.320]  Then Paul Joseph Watson from London, England, always a firebrand of key intel.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:04:58.581]  He'll be joining us.
[02:04:58.921 --> 02:05:00.082]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:05:00.102 --> 02:05:00.142]  800-259-9231.
[02:05:05.205 --> 02:05:06.546]  What do you think about what we're talking about?
[02:05:06.566 --> 02:05:07.006]  Do you agree?
[02:05:07.046 --> 02:05:07.667]  Do you disagree?
[02:05:07.687 --> 02:05:08.347]  Stay with us.
[02:05:10.568 --> 02:05:16.072]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[02:05:16.572 --> 02:05:20.535]  Unveil Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[02:05:21.235 --> 02:05:21.696]  30 servings.
[02:05:21.896 --> 02:05:24.477]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[02:05:24.797 --> 02:05:25.858]  It is simply amazing.
[02:05:25.918 --> 02:05:26.859]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:27.259 --> 02:05:31.660]  There's a million different products like this out there that they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:45.263]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[02:05:45.643 --> 02:05:46.844]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[02:05:46.884 --> 02:05:48.064]  I put it in my protein shake.
[02:05:48.684 --> 02:05:54.189]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[02:05:54.209 --> 02:05:57.231]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[02:05:57.271 --> 02:05:59.513]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[02:06:00.114 --> 02:06:06.259]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[02:06:06.459 --> 02:06:09.401]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here, okay?
[02:06:09.441 --> 02:06:11.103]  Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[02:06:11.363 --> 02:06:14.425]  There's some great stuff out there.
[02:06:14.445 --> 02:06:18.388]  And there's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[02:06:19.088 --> 02:06:19.969]  There's some good stuff out there.
[02:06:20.129 --> 02:06:22.811]  This is just the very best we can bring you.
[02:06:22.831 --> 02:06:24.872]  And when you buy it, you support InfoWars.
[02:06:25.132 --> 02:06:26.173]  You support the reporters.
[02:06:26.413 --> 02:06:27.154]  You support yourself.
[02:06:28.393 --> 02:06:47.962]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this and why this is just this total complete package for your body because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[02:06:48.482 --> 02:06:49.103]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:06:49.143 --> 02:06:52.305]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[02:06:52.385 --> 02:06:53.626]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[02:06:53.646 --> 02:06:54.467]  Tell folks about that.
[02:06:54.487 --> 02:06:57.129]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[02:06:57.149 --> 02:07:00.651]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[02:07:01.232 --> 02:07:07.576]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine, each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[02:07:07.997 --> 02:07:11.199]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[02:07:11.219 --> 02:07:12.740]  34 other ones you can check out.
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:14.802]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[02:07:15.302 --> 02:07:17.604]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[02:07:18.004 --> 02:07:25.408]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just... By the way, look on the other side, too, because we're showing people the minerals and things.
[02:07:25.448 --> 02:07:27.289]  Let's look at the vitamins right there, Old Scott, in there.
[02:07:27.309 --> 02:07:27.989]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:07:28.009 --> 02:07:28.290]  Top left.
[02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:31.912]  Again, if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:07:32.272 --> 02:07:35.333]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's that other source?
[02:07:36.014 --> 02:07:38.755]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[02:07:40.467 --> 02:07:40.867]  Retinol.
[02:07:40.887 --> 02:07:45.369]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:46.109]  And you know what?
[02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:48.350]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[02:07:48.570 --> 02:07:49.171]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[02:07:49.191 --> 02:07:56.213]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[02:07:56.533 --> 02:08:02.076]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[02:08:02.556 --> 02:08:03.396]  So get them today.
[02:08:03.496 --> 02:08:05.537]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:21.670 --> 02:08:26.391]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:31.072 --> 02:08:33.473]  We've now kicked off hour number three.
[02:08:33.573 --> 02:08:40.955]  Paul Watson, another fresh horse in the fight, comes in at the start of the next hour from London, England.
[02:08:41.415 --> 02:08:47.056]  We have the founder of the Northeast Intelligence Network, co-host of Hagman & Hagman, Doug Hagman.
[02:08:47.597 --> 02:08:48.957]  Our guest, a guy who
[02:08:50.916 --> 02:08:56.921]  I mean, his sources, back before any of this even started, he laid out the whole battle plan from his FBI and DHS sources.
[02:08:59.043 --> 02:09:07.251]  And I've just got to tell you that I don't lionize our government, our federal government, and the things it does.
[02:09:07.271 --> 02:09:11.114]  I think the DEA has been caught doing horribly unconstitutional things, so have other agencies.
[02:09:12.255 --> 02:09:13.196]  But this is our country.
[02:09:14.465 --> 02:09:18.026]  We have a bunch of multinational globalists in the middle of it trying to bring it down.
[02:09:18.126 --> 02:09:19.866]  So we can reform stuff later.
[02:09:19.926 --> 02:09:21.727]  We can fight with each other later as Americans.
[02:09:21.747 --> 02:09:29.529]  We're not going to have a bunch of foreign globalist weirdos like George Soros in here playing us off against each other like we're a bunch of idiots.
[02:09:30.009 --> 02:09:31.550]  I think that's the message we got to put out here.
[02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:40.412]  And the people that don't get that, even some libertarians and conservatives that see the excesses of government and police and see police as a representation of government,
[02:09:43.852 --> 02:09:52.941]  Celebrating cops being shot in the back of the head, and I do see that sentiment out there, is the stuff collapses are made of.
[02:09:54.862 --> 02:10:04.451]  And the type of people that talk like that, I guarantee are the ones that when the rubber meets the road aren't going to raise a rifle up to defend their family or this republic.
[02:10:05.312 --> 02:10:07.274]  I'm doing everything I can to fix things peacefully.
[02:10:08.752 --> 02:10:16.774]  I'm doing everything I can so people know who the real enemies are in this country, so they don't kick off a civil war and then we all kill each other and do the globalist job for them.
[02:10:16.794 --> 02:10:19.555]  I'm gonna explain this one more time and go back to our guests and the calls.
[02:10:20.215 --> 02:10:29.197]  The microcosm of the confirmed emails that Hillary, and when we got this from sources, I was like, she's that bold?
[02:10:29.277 --> 02:10:30.297]  And then it turned out to be true.
[02:10:32.158 --> 02:10:36.899]  They had buses coming in, paid for by MoveOn and other groups,
[02:10:37.748 --> 02:10:53.283]  That's Soros with Bernie Sanders shirts on, given a lunch and like 50 bucks, depending on which city it was, they put him up in hotels to attack Trump people and then to say Trump was at fault and Bernie was at fault.
[02:10:54.244 --> 02:10:58.909]  That is a microcosm of the civil war they want to start in this country between citizens and local government.
[02:10:59.149 --> 02:10:59.850]  It's stupid.
[02:11:00.785 --> 02:11:03.206]  And it's them playing their enemies off against each other.
[02:11:03.506 --> 02:11:05.286]  The globalists aren't against this country.
[02:11:05.367 --> 02:11:08.347]  They want to bankrupt it because they can't compete with it.
[02:11:09.928 --> 02:11:12.629]  We're under scientific military attack.
[02:11:13.009 --> 02:11:21.972]  New emails are out showing Soros directing the UN and Peter Sutherland how to flood Europe and use it as a political force to bring down the nations.
[02:11:25.619 --> 02:11:28.920]  I can't exaggerate enough to describe how bad this is, okay?
[02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:31.121]  Because reality is much bigger than what I can say.
[02:11:31.941 --> 02:11:34.782]  But we're up against cold-blooded evil.
[02:11:36.623 --> 02:11:39.024]  So, are there a lot of issues, a lot of problems in this country?
[02:11:39.144 --> 02:11:39.724]  Absolutely.
[02:11:40.225 --> 02:11:43.406]  We'll fix those problems after we've defeated the New World Order.
[02:11:44.346 --> 02:11:47.768]  Because it's the big enemy that wants you poor.
[02:11:49.096 --> 02:11:54.140]  I'll guarantee you, your local government, if it's not New World Order run, some of them are, it wants you to be prosperous and successful.
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:57.142]  For all our problems, Americans like to be successful.
[02:11:59.083 --> 02:12:03.126]  And I'm not going to sit here and watch them blow this country's engine, because they've almost done it.
[02:12:03.406 --> 02:12:08.710]  Mr. Hagman, other points, the awakening, tricks they may pull, and then I want to go to phone calls, my friend.
[02:12:09.191 --> 02:12:10.692]  Hagman at Hagman.com, thanks for joining us.
[02:12:11.789 --> 02:12:13.851]  You know, thanks so much for having me, Alex.
[02:12:14.471 --> 02:12:17.613]  I think you just really summarized it very eloquently.
[02:12:18.314 --> 02:12:22.717]  What we're seeing right now is the plans that have gone awry.
[02:12:22.777 --> 02:12:25.479]  You know, the globalists can make the plans.
[02:12:25.539 --> 02:12:26.680]  They have their objectives.
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:29.302]  We laid them out back in 2000, well 2008, 2007, 2008, and again in 2011 into 2012.
[02:12:36.447 --> 02:12:52.764]  The 2012 election went to Obama, so of course there was no necessity at that point to really pull the grenade pin on anything of detriment, you know, to burn the house down back then.
[02:12:52.824 --> 02:12:58.630]  But now we're facing an entirely different, they're facing an entirely different scenario with a lot more people who are awake.
[02:12:59.530 --> 02:13:02.033]  And I think this is a race right now.
[02:13:02.693 --> 02:13:05.056]  It's an information race as well as a war.
[02:13:05.816 --> 02:13:09.339]  The more information that gets out there, the more people are saying, wait a minute, there's something wrong here.
[02:13:09.379 --> 02:13:10.260]  We know there's something wrong.
[02:13:11.862 --> 02:13:23.853]  But then, of course, Alex, you're going to have people, and I think we see it, the people that you could have Hillary sacrificing children on the White House lawn, and they would find a way to spin it or to approve it or to whatever, to cover it up.
[02:13:24.353 --> 02:13:51.533]  But having said all of that, I think right now, today, and in the days, weeks, and months ahead, I think we're looking at a very volatile situation domestically and globally, and I think it's incumbent upon us as truth-tellers and truth-seekers as well to get the information out there, to inform as many people as possible, and to be very alert and aware of what could happen, and to really expect the unexpected.
[02:13:51.573 --> 02:13:52.634]  As I said earlier, I think
[02:13:53.354 --> 02:14:01.857]  A lot of times, and I look back in my investigative career, any time I've ever had a problem, it usually comes from someplace I never thought it would come from.
[02:14:02.977 --> 02:14:04.398]  Blindside of me, never saw it coming.
[02:14:04.418 --> 02:14:07.219]  So I think we have to kind of watch that as well.
[02:14:08.859 --> 02:14:12.820]  Watch what we're not seeing, perhaps, what we don't really expect.
[02:14:13.241 --> 02:14:14.261]  And I think that's our greatest fear.
[02:14:14.281 --> 02:14:15.962]  They could release some type of bio-weapon.
[02:14:16.562 --> 02:14:18.162]  Who knows, yeah, yeah.
[02:14:18.722 --> 02:14:20.083]  I mean, really, there's anything they could do.
[02:14:20.748 --> 02:14:35.395]  Yeah, and I do believe, Alex, I think that the fact that you've got these tens, really tens of thousands of Muslims coming into this country to balkanize America, to water down our culture, our language, our borders, as Michael Savage says,
[02:14:36.215 --> 02:14:46.137]  To really take over, change the makeup of our country, I think is part and parcel to this, but the ISIS factor as well.
[02:14:46.738 --> 02:14:47.898]  They're not finished with ISIS.
[02:14:47.918 --> 02:14:49.078]  They're not finished weaponizing.
[02:14:49.118 --> 02:14:51.199]  Well, obviously, they brought in five million there.
[02:14:51.279 --> 02:14:54.059]  It's probably millions here they're covering up, saying it's tens of thousands.
[02:14:54.359 --> 02:14:54.939]  We know that's not true.
[02:14:54.959 --> 02:14:57.240]  It's tens of thousands in Austin, Texas, alone.
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:00.941]  How do they think they're going to get away with more jihad attacks than ever before
[02:15:01.641 --> 02:15:05.107]  When they're the ones that brought him in and then they take our rights as a counter to that.
[02:15:05.547 --> 02:15:09.093]  I mean clearly they've got some big plan for forcing all the jihadis in.
[02:15:09.494 --> 02:15:11.697]  Soros talks about political opportunities.
[02:15:12.038 --> 02:15:14.021]  What does he mean by that in this new email?
[02:15:16.368 --> 02:15:20.170]  Wow, great question, interesting concept, the opportunity.
[02:15:20.870 --> 02:15:32.577]  I think any time that there is a problem, a crisis, a situation that is, well like the, who said it, Rahm Emanuel, never let a crisis go to waste.
[02:15:32.997 --> 02:15:42.923]  I think any time that we have, or we're faced, or the country that is faced with a situation that is problematic, I think that it could be spun into something different.
[02:15:42.963 --> 02:15:43.403]  For example,
[02:15:44.183 --> 02:15:52.869]  We've got this massive problem with Islam in terms of the attacks over in Europe.
[02:15:52.889 --> 02:15:56.051]  If that happens here, there's going to be pushback.
[02:15:56.611 --> 02:15:57.752]  How do you handle that pushback?
[02:15:58.212 --> 02:16:00.494]  You don't go after the anti-Islamic
[02:16:01.034 --> 02:16:01.715]  That's the admitted plan.
[02:16:01.735 --> 02:16:04.456]  I mean, they admit in Europe, they just ban all free speech, period.
[02:16:16.563 --> 02:16:17.144]  And there you go.
[02:16:17.204 --> 02:16:37.179]  So, to me, I believe that's the written implementation, the plans, the written plans of the implementation of that larger, again, think bigger... Well, they've admitted global government is in trouble from the Washington Post to the Financial Times of London, and folks, we should do a whole show asking listeners, what type of curveballs could they throw?
[02:16:37.659 --> 02:16:39.561]  What type of tricks do they have up their sleeves?
[02:16:40.001 --> 02:16:40.842]  That is a really great point.
[02:16:40.862 --> 02:16:44.545]  And I'll tell listeners this, you with your smartphone or you with a camera,
[02:16:45.325 --> 02:16:48.067]  Wherever you're at, videotape everything when there's a terror attack.
[02:16:48.087 --> 02:16:50.810]  Videotape everything when there's something weird going on.
[02:16:51.290 --> 02:17:01.319]  Get it out on the internet and analysts, citizen analysts, will look at that and keep catching them because the establishment is scared at how much humet just regular people have.
[02:17:01.379 --> 02:17:02.880]  How much human intelligence is out there.
[02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:03.520]  Folks,
[02:17:04.381 --> 02:17:07.625]  You're just as effective as anybody in history when you decide to take action.
[02:17:08.566 --> 02:17:12.350]  And I'm telling you, because I'm not the smartest guy around, and I've done a lot in 21 years on air.
[02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:19.457]  Take action, know what we're facing, realize what's going on, reach out to people, and we're going to defeat this new world order.
[02:17:20.078 --> 02:17:21.399]  Let's go ahead and go to some phone calls here.
[02:17:21.419 --> 02:17:22.441]  Who's been holding the longest?
[02:17:23.527 --> 02:17:27.389]  Let me say Islamic rule in USA, DNC leaks.
[02:17:28.509 --> 02:17:29.810]  Let's go ahead.
[02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:32.051]  Voter fraud, cell phone photos of polls.
[02:17:32.571 --> 02:17:33.432]  Trump and Hillary.
[02:17:33.492 --> 02:17:34.432]  Who should I go to first?
[02:17:34.452 --> 02:17:35.573]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:17:36.473 --> 02:17:39.215]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ed in Arizona.
[02:17:39.235 --> 02:17:43.317]  You're on the air with the founder of the Northeast Intelligence Network, Mr. Hagman.
[02:17:43.337 --> 02:17:43.637]  Go ahead.
[02:17:45.458 --> 02:17:45.998]  Thank you, sir.
[02:17:46.058 --> 02:17:47.158]  Please just give me a minute.
[02:17:47.198 --> 02:17:48.159]  I'll be very brief.
[02:17:48.259 --> 02:17:50.380]  100% way to end voter fraud.
[02:17:50.914 --> 02:17:53.917]  Everyone take your cell phone into the privacy of the voting booth.
[02:17:53.957 --> 02:17:55.839]  Take a photo of your vote for Trump.
[02:17:56.379 --> 02:17:58.461]  Post it to a website with your zip code.
[02:17:58.482 --> 02:18:00.083]  You could create a simple website.
[02:18:00.163 --> 02:18:01.785]  Also those vote protector people.
[02:18:02.285 --> 02:18:04.407]  We could actually change the entire paradigm.
[02:18:04.507 --> 02:18:07.090]  Sure, it's just organizing, coordinating all those people.
[02:18:07.110 --> 02:18:10.433]  The bigger thing is exit pollers in the 10 battleground states.
[02:18:10.753 --> 02:18:11.795]  That's what Trump's doing, but yes.
[02:18:13.823 --> 02:18:14.764]  Well, yes, that will work.
[02:18:14.864 --> 02:18:21.128]  Also, well, it would be verifiable, it would be instant, and if you could just get this pushed out, maybe the drudge could carry it.
[02:18:21.489 --> 02:18:25.832]  If you get enough people to do that, it's instant, verifiable, with the zip code and a photo.
[02:18:27.171 --> 02:18:30.333]  I think it would change the entire paradigm of exit polling.
[02:18:30.413 --> 02:18:43.779]  There's a lot of coalition data stuff there and regionalization and tracking and verification and then you'd have security issues and ID issues and integration issues and re-upfeed coalition issues.
[02:18:43.980 --> 02:18:46.581]  The point is we need exit polls.
[02:18:46.621 --> 02:18:46.901]  Go ahead.
[02:18:48.562 --> 02:18:54.945]  Oh yes, I know, but I'm just saying if there's zip codes attached to just a photo of a vote and there's always those little codes on each photo,
[02:18:55.424 --> 02:19:00.209]  But I also want Trump to think big ideas of getting us back to the moon, back missions to Mars.
[02:19:00.510 --> 02:19:04.314]  And I'm sick of people referring to America's heartland as the Rust Belt.
[02:19:04.594 --> 02:19:06.336]  That's a pejorative against our country.
[02:19:06.356 --> 02:19:08.659]  I think Trump should really take offense to that.
[02:19:08.839 --> 02:19:09.720]  I personally do.
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:11.742]  And they should be reknowned as America's
[02:19:12.843 --> 02:19:15.144]  No, I hear you.
[02:19:15.324 --> 02:19:20.686]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[02:19:21.006 --> 02:19:21.986]  Really good points.
[02:19:22.126 --> 02:19:23.447]  I'm not pooh-poohing what you said.
[02:19:24.167 --> 02:19:30.649]  It's just actually trying to organize that and then everybody takes a photo and sends it to a site with a zip code.
[02:19:30.669 --> 02:19:33.970]  Then how do you visually scan that and then collate all those?
[02:19:34.030 --> 02:19:35.991]  I mean, Mr. Hagman?
[02:19:37.307 --> 02:19:38.928]  Yeah, I'm not sure.
[02:19:39.548 --> 02:19:39.848]  Wow.
[02:19:40.669 --> 02:19:45.311]  Anything digital in my view right now could be manipulated and that certainly could be corrupted.
[02:19:45.891 --> 02:19:48.712]  We definitely need to have some sort of verification.
[02:19:48.732 --> 02:19:52.314]  We need exit polls and we need poll watchers there to make sure we don't have people voting repeatedly.
[02:19:52.894 --> 02:19:54.395]  Yep, I agree.
[02:19:54.415 --> 02:19:56.296]  Folks, I've talked to the top election fraud experts.
[02:19:56.316 --> 02:19:57.036]  That's what needs to be done.
[02:19:57.276 --> 02:19:58.557]  I'm not pooping what the caller is saying.
[02:19:58.817 --> 02:20:00.718]  He's going in the right direction raising this problem.
[02:20:01.704 --> 02:20:07.348]  Well, it goes back to, you know, the judges, the ID for voting.
[02:20:07.668 --> 02:20:08.069]  Come on.
[02:20:08.149 --> 02:20:11.291]  I mean, how simple is that one issue?
[02:20:11.591 --> 02:20:15.634]  The Democrats in a bunch of states are trying to pass laws to let illegals vote.
[02:20:16.074 --> 02:20:16.335]  Sure.
[02:20:16.695 --> 02:20:19.157]  Vote early and often for the illegals.
[02:20:19.297 --> 02:20:19.737]  Absolutely.
[02:20:19.777 --> 02:20:22.179]  They have illegals now doing recruiting drives.
[02:20:22.219 --> 02:20:23.860]  And again, I can't go to other countries and do that.
[02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:25.401]  I'm not like, why do you hate these people?
[02:20:25.681 --> 02:20:26.302]  I don't hate them.
[02:20:26.722 --> 02:20:28.744]  It's just that it's organized crime.
[02:20:29.664 --> 02:20:31.966]  Good Lord!
[02:20:31.986 --> 02:20:33.287]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:20:34.168 --> 02:20:35.949]  Let's talk to Michael in Tennessee.
[02:20:35.969 --> 02:20:36.490]  You're on the air.
[02:20:36.510 --> 02:20:36.830]  Go ahead.
[02:20:38.391 --> 02:20:39.392]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:20:39.432 --> 02:20:39.813]  Good, brother.
[02:20:41.174 --> 02:20:43.456]  First of all, I just wanted to address Mr. Hagman.
[02:20:43.496 --> 02:20:51.482]  He was talking earlier about Hillary executing kids on the front lawn of the White House and that they would find a way to make it okay for her.
[02:20:52.103 --> 02:20:54.645]  Why not just call that extreme late-term abortion?
[02:20:55.892 --> 02:21:05.057]  Actually, we've gone out on the street in California and Austin and told liberals that Hillary or Obama wanted to kill kids up to three, and they agree with it, and say it is late-term, post-birth abortion.
[02:21:05.077 --> 02:21:06.118]  So that's actually not a joke.
[02:21:06.438 --> 02:21:10.841]  In Islamic State, when they were cutting little kids' heads off and a video came out, they said it was an accident.
[02:21:11.361 --> 02:21:14.143]  So she would just have to say it was an accident, and then it would be okay.
[02:21:14.163 --> 02:21:16.264]  Oh, of course.
[02:21:16.324 --> 02:21:21.407]  You know, somebody told somebody that somebody disappears and gets killed, and it's all an accident.
[02:21:21.427 --> 02:21:24.709]  But see, no matter what, no matter how extreme you say, they're already doing it.
[02:21:26.047 --> 02:21:26.487]  Of course.
[02:21:27.248 --> 02:21:40.837]  Another thing I wanted to bring up real quick, I was doing some reading earlier on Wikipedia, under New World Order, and believe it or not, they mention Alex Jones, not as a liberator of truth, but as a right-wing agitator.
[02:21:41.297 --> 02:21:49.643]  And I just find that amazing that they take people who are giving the people what they deserve, the truth, and form... Where was this?
[02:21:49.783 --> 02:21:50.343]  Where was this?
[02:21:51.584 --> 02:21:54.026]  If you go on Wikipedia, on New World Order,
[02:21:54.548 --> 02:21:57.129]  And go down to where it says, Modern Conspiracy Theories.
[02:21:57.269 --> 02:22:05.953]  It labels you as a right-wing... Yeah, you know, somebody ought to do a piece on that, because... Because the world government has been announced.
[02:22:06.013 --> 02:22:07.313]  I mean, the Pope's calling for it.
[02:22:07.333 --> 02:22:09.314]  End of borders, global taxes.
[02:22:09.594 --> 02:22:12.755]  We should be getting awards for, you know, talking about it 20 years ago.
[02:22:13.135 --> 02:22:16.357]  Or Ron Paul 30 years ago, or Ronald Reagan 50 years ago.
[02:22:16.657 --> 02:22:17.097]  We don't.
[02:22:17.157 --> 02:22:19.578]  We get ridiculed because we were right, Doug.
[02:22:20.359 --> 02:22:20.579]  Yeah.
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:24.765]  I mean, Gary Allen in his book, None Dare Call a Conspiracy, which you've got on your website.
[02:22:25.406 --> 02:22:25.927]  Absolutely.
[02:22:25.967 --> 02:22:28.090]  I mean, this has been out there for a long time.
[02:22:28.110 --> 02:22:32.036]  And I find it really interesting now people are developing some level of
[02:22:33.260 --> 02:22:33.580]  I don't know.
[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:34.361]  Guts, I guess.
[02:22:35.442 --> 02:22:43.331]  You know, now that the ice has been broken to come out and say, OK, yeah, OK, I guess you guys were right, meaning you were right when you were talking about this.
[02:22:43.351 --> 02:22:43.851]  Well, you too, brother.
[02:22:43.911 --> 02:22:48.697]  I mean, hell, it was like I was like three years old and had my dad sit around the coffee table talking about this.
[02:22:48.717 --> 02:22:52.080]  So I'm certainly not I'm a late comer.
[02:22:52.100 --> 02:22:52.340]  Go ahead.
[02:22:53.018 --> 02:23:12.397]  No, it's interesting to see how this is all really developing and playing out, and it's interesting to see how each one of us, and I really believe this, anyone that's listening to this program or watching this program, you've got the opportunity to change the course of history, and if we don't do something right now, I don't believe
[02:23:12.837 --> 02:23:14.258]  We're going to have another chance at it.
[02:23:14.298 --> 02:23:17.501]  We have one chance and the chance is now and we need to take action.
[02:23:17.521 --> 02:23:24.708]  We need to think not of ourselves but of our children and of the legacy which we're going to leave behind.
[02:23:24.748 --> 02:23:25.869]  That's just my personal view.
[02:23:27.108 --> 02:23:27.689]  Absolutely.
[02:23:27.729 --> 02:23:34.275]  And look, Hillary Clinton has got over a hundred million dollars the last two years alone to her foundation from Gulf states.
[02:23:34.335 --> 02:23:35.095]  That's what we know of.
[02:23:35.776 --> 02:23:40.941]  That throw homosexuals off buildings, that chop women's heads off if they talk back to their husband.
[02:23:41.341 --> 02:23:44.704]  And then I got to be lectured how I'm against a woman because I don't like Hillary?
[02:23:45.184 --> 02:23:47.867]  It has nothing to do with what's going on between her legs.
[02:23:48.788 --> 02:23:49.528]  She's a monster.
[02:23:50.129 --> 02:23:52.831]  And I'm just so sick of being told I'm sexist or racist.
[02:23:53.712 --> 02:23:56.480]  When really all I'm guilty of in my life is spoiling everybody around me.
[02:23:57.022 --> 02:23:58.345]  I just, I'm so sick of it!
[02:24:00.749 --> 02:24:01.169]  Exactly.
[02:24:01.189 --> 02:24:05.291]  You know, I think we're going to see ties, too, now that you mention this.
[02:24:05.391 --> 02:24:16.415]  We're going to see, as these emails become even more prolific, exposed, you're going to see ties where the Saudis, really Hillary Clinton has been on the payroll of the Saudis.
[02:24:16.795 --> 02:24:20.216]  She abused her position at the State Department, as you write and point out.
[02:24:20.717 --> 02:24:24.838]  She has all of her aides, Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills.
[02:24:24.858 --> 02:24:26.679]  You're going to see all this lawlessness.
[02:24:27.179 --> 02:24:32.002]  But being paid for by foreign entities that include, but are not limited to, Saudi Arabia.
[02:24:32.022 --> 02:24:33.203]  Totally illegal if you were out in it.
[02:24:33.883 --> 02:24:34.084]  Right.
[02:24:34.184 --> 02:24:34.664]  Oh, yeah.
[02:24:34.704 --> 02:24:35.765]  We'd be, yeah, exactly.
[02:24:35.805 --> 02:24:37.246]  We'd be in a prison or something.
[02:24:37.266 --> 02:24:38.246]  We should be.
[02:24:38.286 --> 02:24:39.307]  And you know, that's what's crazy.
[02:24:39.347 --> 02:24:42.029]  I mean, not getting into the cops' mind, but let's look at their position for a while.
[02:24:43.257 --> 02:24:49.239]  I know they're the front of the state, kind of the problem, we let the state become this, but I'm out there going to a Black Lives Matter communist event.
[02:24:49.719 --> 02:24:51.220]  Cops had just been shot days before.
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:54.360]  Cops on average don't get shot that often, but it's still a dangerous job.
[02:24:54.781 --> 02:24:57.101]  But what is dangerous is going to a Black Lives Matter rally.
[02:24:57.742 --> 02:25:08.445]  And imagine I'm the main target there, I go and I do it, and it just put me in the mindset for like 30 minutes of being a cop at one of those rallies, where you're out there in the middle of a square, anybody can shoot you.
[02:25:08.945 --> 02:25:19.352]  And so all I'm saying is, at least have a little bit of empathy, and if we have empathy for the police, then they're going to listen to us, and we can reform what's happening when bad politicians are trying to twist the police.
[02:25:19.852 --> 02:25:21.674]  That's why they don't want us to get along with the police.
[02:25:21.954 --> 02:25:24.575]  They don't want the citizens to be interfacing with other citizens.
[02:25:26.457 --> 02:25:26.677]  Right.
[02:25:27.237 --> 02:25:31.400]  And you know, you're going to have bad apples in every group and every demographic.
[02:25:31.420 --> 02:25:32.501]  There'll be plenty of dirty cops.
[02:25:32.970 --> 02:25:44.655]  Yeah, but what you're saying, and again, I'm right there with you on this, we have to look at how we are all, all of us are being gamed by these globalists.
[02:25:45.015 --> 02:25:50.277]  How they're managing, well, mapping and managing the human domain, where we heard that before.
[02:25:50.917 --> 02:26:00.221]  As an aside, you know, this Tavistockian influence over our language, over what we say, over the... This is not freedom!
[02:26:00.741 --> 02:26:05.267]  Our elite is allied with the most scumbag communists and radical Muslims you can imagine.
[02:26:05.367 --> 02:26:06.288]  They're bad people.
[02:26:06.628 --> 02:26:07.930]  We want a change of management.
[02:26:08.170 --> 02:26:11.013]  It's our country and you better back off New World Order.
[02:26:11.774 --> 02:26:14.037]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kristen in California.
[02:26:14.057 --> 02:26:15.839]  She says she's a poll worker on voting.
[02:26:15.859 --> 02:26:16.500]  Kristen, go ahead.
[02:26:17.236 --> 02:26:17.696]  Hi, Alex.
[02:26:17.896 --> 02:26:28.798]  I was a poll worker in the California June primary, and I estimate that 50 to 60 percent of voters voluntarily showed their ID when they came up to vote, so we could look them up on the roster.
[02:26:29.138 --> 02:26:37.700]  We didn't ask, and we couldn't by law, and people don't mind showing ID, and I am in the most liberal area of California you can imagine, and people still don't mind showing ID.
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:42.961]  What do you make of Stanford Research Institute finding that Bernie Sanders was the winner and was defrauded?
[02:26:42.981 --> 02:26:46.662]  That's the Hill newspaper and even Reuters.
[02:26:47.645 --> 02:26:53.148]  We certainly saw a lot more Bernie stickers out here and Bernie signage in California than Hillary stuff, I'll tell you that.
[02:26:55.449 --> 02:26:55.729]  Wow.
[02:26:56.069 --> 02:26:58.050]  Other points you'd like to make as a poll worker?
[02:26:59.221 --> 02:27:01.983]  I think it's important for people to go out there and volunteer.
[02:27:02.083 --> 02:27:09.367]  It's a long day, but it's worth it, and you get to see who comes in, you get to watch your neighbors, and you get to watch the poll workers too, and also the poll watchers.
[02:27:09.607 --> 02:27:19.413]  A lot of liberal groups send in their people and demand to see their roster every hour we update, and they, you know, get real snarky about it, but we need to have conservative good people in there doing that work too.
[02:27:22.054 --> 02:27:22.734]  It certainly is.
[02:27:22.754 --> 02:27:24.315]  Well, I've been a poll watcher myself.
[02:27:24.756 --> 02:27:26.517]  I've been an exit poller.
[02:27:27.197 --> 02:27:30.679]  I haven't done it in probably 18 years, but I'm going to do it again this year.
[02:27:30.699 --> 02:27:33.761]  We're going to be here covering it live, and I intend to go out myself.
[02:27:33.781 --> 02:27:40.265]  I'm going to pick a precinct, and Texas is key, because it's probably, but they're even saying Texas is going to go Hillary.
[02:27:40.925 --> 02:27:43.727]  Georgia, Utah, who believes any of this?
[02:27:43.827 --> 02:27:46.108]  I mean, these polls are completely backwards.
[02:27:47.609 --> 02:27:50.051]  I think California is even in play for Trump, or do you think
[02:27:50.851 --> 02:27:52.171]  Otherwise, what are you seeing, Kristen?
[02:27:54.192 --> 02:28:01.174]  Well, it seems to me that California is going to go for Hillary and that the Trump people are embarrassed and afraid to even pronounce it.
[02:28:01.194 --> 02:28:02.694]  There are no Trump signs around here.
[02:28:02.734 --> 02:28:04.394]  People are afraid that they're going to get vandalized.
[02:28:04.454 --> 02:28:05.555]  I wouldn't put one on my lawn.
[02:28:05.575 --> 02:28:05.955]  No way.
[02:28:06.335 --> 02:28:07.575]  You know, they'll trash my house.
[02:28:08.055 --> 02:28:09.056]  That's been happening.
[02:28:11.624 --> 02:28:15.788]  I don't want to get involved in that, but you know, Trump is the better of the two.
[02:28:15.848 --> 02:28:16.629]  Hillary, no way.
[02:28:16.709 --> 02:28:17.250]  Can't have it.
[02:28:17.330 --> 02:28:17.770]  Don't do it.
[02:28:17.890 --> 02:28:19.152]  A no vote is a Hillary vote.
[02:28:19.292 --> 02:28:20.313]  So people, go vote Trump.
[02:28:20.753 --> 02:28:21.254]  Absolutely.
[02:28:21.294 --> 02:28:23.156]  People voting for Green Party or Gary Johnson.
[02:28:23.196 --> 02:28:24.077]  I've been a big libertarian.
[02:28:24.297 --> 02:28:29.562]  I've been about building third parties, but I've been, I mean, I've interviewed Gary Johnson like 15 years ago.
[02:28:29.642 --> 02:28:30.143]  Different guy.
[02:28:31.522 --> 02:28:34.624]  And man, the times he's been around, the last few times, they asked, hey, you want Gary Johnson on?
[02:28:34.644 --> 02:28:37.046]  Even before he ran for president, I went, no, I don't want him on.
[02:28:37.606 --> 02:28:38.787]  Because he'd been here in studio.
[02:28:38.807 --> 02:28:41.688]  And I'm like, hey, man, he's just like, thank you, Alex, good to speak.
[02:28:41.748 --> 02:28:42.749]  And he's just like a robot.
[02:28:43.089 --> 02:28:45.591]  And I mean, I think Gary Johnson has gone over to the dark side.
[02:28:45.611 --> 02:28:46.071]  What do you think?
[02:28:46.812 --> 02:28:48.573]  What do you think about voting third party, Doug Hackman?
[02:28:49.215 --> 02:29:03.680]  No, you know, in a perfect world, in a perfect society, well, even in a non-representative republic where there's no electoral college, yeah, maybe, in a democracy, but we're not in a democracy.
[02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:05.721]  We're in a representative republic.
[02:29:05.761 --> 02:29:06.581]  The rules are different.
[02:29:06.621 --> 02:29:15.104]  So, you're talking about viability, and I think that any other vote outside of what we have been given, the cards that we've been given to play,
[02:29:15.845 --> 02:29:16.946]  Would be a mistake.
[02:29:17.006 --> 02:29:17.686]  So you're there.
[02:29:17.786 --> 02:29:18.367]  Absolutely.
[02:29:18.387 --> 02:29:20.648]  You got two bad candidates sometimes for president.
[02:29:21.729 --> 02:29:23.930]  Then, you know, sure, go third party to build a third party.
[02:29:24.371 --> 02:29:25.511]  I helped build Libertarian Party.
[02:29:25.552 --> 02:29:26.352]  I mean, I really helped him.
[02:29:26.852 --> 02:29:29.914]  Now I see him just turned over like some kind of globalist organization.
[02:29:30.355 --> 02:29:32.076]  I'm really ashamed of Libertarian Party right now, Doug.
[02:29:32.756 --> 02:29:33.397]  Oh, yeah, I agree.
[02:29:34.682 --> 02:29:38.463]  I mean, it's just not being TPP, some unelected secret corporate thing.
[02:29:38.863 --> 02:29:39.724]  Oh, it's free market.
[02:29:39.764 --> 02:29:40.644]  No, it's not free market.
[02:29:40.904 --> 02:29:44.105]  Corporations can conquer you just as fast as government, Gary Johnson.
[02:29:44.525 --> 02:29:45.965]  Maybe I should get Gary Johnson on.
[02:29:45.985 --> 02:29:47.166]  I'll tear the living hell out of him.
[02:29:47.186 --> 02:29:49.066]  I mean, I am sick of him, man.
[02:29:49.366 --> 02:29:50.927]  He's there to make sure Hillary gets in.
[02:29:50.947 --> 02:29:53.048]  We're going to come back with more of your calls.
[02:29:53.388 --> 02:29:55.108]  Our reporters on the ground at Doug Hagman.
[02:29:55.468 --> 02:29:57.289]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:29:59.326 --> 02:30:02.328]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.269 --> 02:30:05.951]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.786 --> 02:30:12.687]  Article from the Associated Press.
[02:30:12.947 --> 02:30:21.210]  A Chicago-based communist revolutionary group was blamed by Milwaukee's police chief for stoking a second day of violence.
[02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:30.553]  Police Chief Ed Flynn said members of a Chicago chapter of the revolutionary communist party turned what had been a peaceful night into a tense one.
[02:30:31.013 --> 02:30:35.416]  TV footage showed a small group of protesters walking or running through the streets.
[02:30:35.657 --> 02:30:49.727]  The fatal police shooting of a 23-year-old black man, Savelle Smith, touched off a weekend of tense and at times violent protests that left at least six businesses burned and several officers injured by flying objects Saturday night.
[02:30:49.947 --> 02:30:55.872]  Fourteen people were arrested overnight, and three police officers and four sheriff's deputies were injured.
[02:30:56.508 --> 02:30:58.913]  InfoWars has its team on the ground.
[02:30:59.294 --> 02:31:03.964]  News Director Rob Dew has already filmed communist recruitment signage.
[02:31:04.304 --> 02:31:07.812]  Go to InfoWars.com for breaking news on Milwaukee.
[02:31:10.529 --> 02:31:12.310]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:31:12.410 --> 02:31:14.290]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:31:14.450 --> 02:31:17.251]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:31:17.352 --> 02:31:23.194]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:23.414 --> 02:31:32.297]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:31:32.597 --> 02:31:37.459]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[02:31:37.679 --> 02:31:39.843]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:40.124 --> 02:31:47.859]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:48.179 --> 02:31:49.121]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:50.337 --> 02:31:52.638]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:54.278 --> 02:31:57.699]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:57.839 --> 02:32:04.301]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:32:04.561 --> 02:32:08.642]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[02:32:10.473 --> 02:32:11.473]  BrainForce is here.
[02:32:12.014 --> 02:32:14.295]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:32:14.555 --> 02:32:22.378]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:32:23.157 --> 02:32:26.739]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:32:26.759 --> 02:32:29.101]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:32:29.461 --> 02:32:32.963]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:32:33.023 --> 02:32:36.165]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:32:36.665 --> 02:32:41.448]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:32:42.008 --> 02:32:43.829]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:32:44.190 --> 02:32:48.612]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:32:48.772 --> 02:32:50.794]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:32:51.414 --> 02:32:52.855]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:32:53.015 --> 02:32:53.255]  Exactly.
[02:32:53.275 --> 02:32:57.061]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:32:57.581 --> 02:33:05.573]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:33:21.661 --> 02:33:25.523]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:26.003 --> 02:33:29.946]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:38.210 --> 02:33:39.150]  He mentioned it earlier.
[02:33:39.671 --> 02:33:41.152]  I think they still sell it.
[02:33:41.292 --> 02:33:43.793]  It's come back into print by a private publisher.
[02:33:44.213 --> 02:33:46.715]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by journalist Gary Allen.
[02:33:47.355 --> 02:33:51.017]  His son went on to found Politico and joined the dark side.
[02:33:52.589 --> 02:33:55.393]  Well, it's time for the New World Order.
[02:33:55.553 --> 02:33:58.918]  But, I already read a bunch of history books by that time.
[02:33:58.958 --> 02:33:59.719]  I was a history buff.
[02:34:00.079 --> 02:34:01.060]  I didn't read really fiction.
[02:34:01.501 --> 02:34:02.682]  I read fiction at first until...
[02:34:04.628 --> 02:34:12.854]  I mean, I was like seven years old and I was reading the Star Wars trilogy and one paperback that my dad, you know, had got, episode four, five, and six.
[02:34:13.395 --> 02:34:17.198]  So I was reading adult science fiction and stuff when I was seven, eight years old.
[02:34:17.498 --> 02:34:18.138]  Really good reader.
[02:34:19.279 --> 02:34:21.561]  Wasn't good at spelling or math, but I've been a good reader.
[02:34:21.581 --> 02:34:26.124]  I mean, I was reading like a, you know, eighth grade level when I was about five.
[02:34:27.325 --> 02:34:30.007]  And I suddenly started reading history books.
[02:34:30.327 --> 02:34:31.729]  And they were just so entertaining.
[02:34:32.619 --> 02:34:35.521]  And I remember being about 10 years old, my mom's going, you're reading Nietzsche?
[02:34:36.121 --> 02:34:36.922]  Do you understand that?
[02:34:36.982 --> 02:34:38.643]  I'm like, not really, but I'm into this.
[02:34:39.944 --> 02:34:49.211]  And then I read None Dare Call a Conspiracy, and I already had so much history when I was like 13 years old, that everything clicked, and that little book.
[02:34:51.721 --> 02:34:52.941]  Tells you basically everything.
[02:34:53.081 --> 02:34:54.962]  How they run it, how the scam operates.
[02:34:55.722 --> 02:35:00.644]  It's like a 200 page version of Tragedy and Hope that Quigley wrote for the position of the globalists.
[02:35:00.724 --> 02:35:02.805]  It's 1100 pages long.
[02:35:04.185 --> 02:35:09.407]  And so I grew up not having some victimhood.
[02:35:09.687 --> 02:35:17.450]  It was just kind of like I knew there was a global government being formed in mega banks and that all this was being set up and I had family that was in
[02:35:20.314 --> 02:35:31.421]  Different secret of black ops and stuff, but that was just kind of like family that did something secret I didn't really you know know what they were doing with that I knew that when I talked to him about stuff, and I was like 13 14 They'd be like that's exactly right kid.
[02:35:31.461 --> 02:35:33.022]  That's how it all works, and that's who does it
[02:35:34.332 --> 02:35:41.275]  Then I went to college and heard all this anti-American garbage all day, and world government being pushed, and I was like, whoa!
[02:35:41.295 --> 02:35:41.355]  Wow!
[02:35:41.495 --> 02:35:42.195]  It's happening!
[02:35:42.515 --> 02:35:43.075]  I forgot!
[02:35:43.095 --> 02:35:45.416]  I knew all this, but I'm living it now!
[02:35:45.796 --> 02:35:46.576]  I'm gonna fight this!
[02:35:47.237 --> 02:35:55.620]  And by the time I was 20 years old, I had an access TV show, by 21 I had a radio show, by 23 syndicated to over 20 stations at that time, close to 200 today.
[02:35:57.180 --> 02:36:01.282]  And what I want to say to new listeners or people, or folks that make jokes at MSNBC,
[02:36:03.618 --> 02:36:06.340]  You can sit there and choose sides, but at least be conscious about it.
[02:36:06.380 --> 02:36:10.802]  Don't lie to yourselves and say you're not signing on to an evil corporate world government.
[02:36:11.662 --> 02:36:13.063]  Because that's what this is.
[02:36:14.384 --> 02:36:22.048]  And I take it personal that a mega corporate world government's being set up that thinks of me as a slave.
[02:36:22.248 --> 02:36:23.349]  I'm not rolling over to it.
[02:36:24.861 --> 02:36:31.687]  And that's what Doug Hagman's standing up against, and that's what Ron Paul stands up against, and Donald Trump, and Matt Drudge, and all these other people.
[02:36:31.727 --> 02:36:38.032]  But we're just focal points of a larger global movement to want to have local control and self-determination.
[02:36:38.172 --> 02:36:41.215]  People say, oh, well, global government's just the next level, like Star Trek.
[02:36:41.776 --> 02:36:49.182]  You go from hunter-gatherers, to agrarian, to city-states, to nation-states, to empires, to regional empires, to global governance.
[02:36:50.443 --> 02:36:52.325]  But who runs the global governance?
[02:36:53.464 --> 02:36:57.146]  It's not like we phased into this over a hundred years and it's democratically done.
[02:36:57.466 --> 02:36:59.907]  This is done by very anti-human people.
[02:37:00.888 --> 02:37:06.990]  I want to go to Jakari Jackson in Milwaukee to talk about this, but Doug Hagman, finishing up, you're going to be riding a shotgun with us.
[02:37:07.811 --> 02:37:09.992]  When did you start learning about the New World Order?
[02:37:10.932 --> 02:37:12.873]  You know, I was a late start, Alex.
[02:37:13.233 --> 02:37:17.735]  Unlike yourself, it took me quite a long time and well into my adulthood.
[02:37:17.815 --> 02:37:18.596]  I don't think I really
[02:37:19.514 --> 02:37:21.215]  I don't think I believed it until right after 9-11.
[02:37:21.235 --> 02:37:22.816]  That's how late of a start I got.
[02:37:22.836 --> 02:37:23.757]  At least I saw it happen.
[02:37:36.964 --> 02:38:00.918]  I saw as we were investigating through our network of investigators, the Islamic terrorist websites and such, I saw, we kept running into good guys, we kept running into FBI and CIA agents in these chat rooms and then it clicked and I thought, oh wait a minute, when we can't tell who the good guys are from the bad, well then we've got a problem and everything that came, everything that you had been talking about and everything that we learned or I'd learned
[02:38:01.518 --> 02:38:08.927]  I read about, then I realized, okay, now we're being gamed, and I realized how vast and how epic this game is.
[02:38:09.247 --> 02:38:10.769]  So I'm a late upstart.
[02:38:11.752 --> 02:38:21.860]  Well, I don't blame people not wanting to think America is still America, but this is corporate, this is a system we've not faced before, it's not a foreign country, it's a globalist operation.
[02:38:22.281 --> 02:38:35.292]  And you think about how the article right here in my stack, how the Communist Party, USA, admittedly the local police chief is saying, came in to the town, Communist group, members in Milwaukee to help revolution.
[02:38:36.553 --> 02:38:37.594]  And you look at how
[02:38:38.843 --> 02:38:43.026]  You know, one cop shoots another cop, one black cop shoots another black cop.
[02:38:43.046 --> 02:38:43.907]  It's clearly not racial.
[02:38:44.227 --> 02:38:47.129]  Now some people are saying this cop might be dirty and had a bad background.
[02:38:47.189 --> 02:38:47.829]  Who knows?
[02:38:48.630 --> 02:38:52.052]  The point is, why does the media then give all this attention?
[02:38:52.713 --> 02:38:53.413]  Why do we cover it?
[02:38:53.433 --> 02:38:54.975]  Well, we've got to cover what the media is going to do.
[02:38:55.755 --> 02:39:00.837]  It's literally just to divert attention away from the larger political things that are unfolding.
[02:39:00.877 --> 02:39:03.038]  And Jakari Jackson is there on the ground in Milwaukee.
[02:39:03.318 --> 02:39:06.780]  Tonight they're going to cover a Trump rally in a nearby suburb.
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:10.041]  Jakari's been there since last night observing.
[02:39:10.081 --> 02:39:11.822]  Thank God things de-escalated last night.
[02:39:12.282 --> 02:39:14.285]  What are your observations, Jakari?
[02:39:14.305 --> 02:39:23.257]  Because to me, so many times statistically, just like cops killing people is very low, I think overall the civil unrest, if you compare it to the rest of the country, is pretty low.
[02:39:23.557 --> 02:39:27.262]  But the media hyping it and saying it's good, that's my concern.
[02:39:27.302 --> 02:39:28.324]  What do you think about what's happening?
[02:39:29.352 --> 02:39:32.475]  Well, since we got here last night, things have been very calm.
[02:39:32.515 --> 02:39:33.736]  We came last night.
[02:39:33.796 --> 02:39:39.281]  I didn't see any National Guard on the street, even though they are in the area prepared to be deployed if necessary.
[02:39:39.561 --> 02:39:42.123]  But thus far, if you look around right now, it's a lot of ATF.
[02:39:42.143 --> 02:39:42.583]  They're new.
[02:39:43.084 --> 02:39:48.428]  Last night, it was mostly the sheriffs and the PD, but the ATF is now out here investigating the scene.
[02:39:48.909 --> 02:39:53.773]  And actually, I read across this interesting article, Alex, where they're talking about the ATF is offering a $10,000 reward for information
[02:39:56.435 --> 02:39:56.795]  We're good to go.
[02:40:17.185 --> 02:40:29.177]  Where he said that he was trying to teach the kids how to drum or another ladies who's like well We have all these after-school programs and summer programs to keep the kids out the streets There are people trying to do positive things here, but unfortunately the the violent minority.
[02:40:29.637 --> 02:40:35.783]  It's the bulk of the media attention Well Gary Haven was here yesterday Jakari, and he talked about the fact that when he was in
[02:40:36.963 --> 02:40:49.068]  Louisiana after the police shootings, that all he saw was basically black people, and also a few white folks or pink folks, whatever you call them, out there with signs saying, Jesus loves all the children, let's come together.
[02:40:49.528 --> 02:40:50.709]  No media attention to that.
[02:40:50.729 --> 02:40:54.910]  And I forgot that some of our reporters have been out in other areas of the country seeing the same thing.
[02:40:55.311 --> 02:40:58.332]  So again, there's a media agenda and a really hyped division here.
[02:40:59.602 --> 02:41:01.564]  Oh yeah, because we go all around the country.
[02:41:01.604 --> 02:41:06.229]  A good example of that, what you're talking about right there, is when the shooting happened in Charleston at the church.
[02:41:06.529 --> 02:41:08.271]  And we went out there, it was right in front of the church.
[02:41:08.431 --> 02:41:17.260]  Many people who were out there, who weren't even necessarily religious or spiritual, they still were out there coming in community, coming together with the community and also with the church and standing by the people.
[02:41:17.800 --> 02:41:19.863]  What do you make of the media's agenda then?
[02:41:19.903 --> 02:41:21.364]  Why do you think they're trying to stir this up?
[02:41:37.557 --> 02:41:40.839]  Well, I guess they were trying to stir it up until they started getting targeted.
[02:41:40.959 --> 02:41:44.040]  Oh yeah, some of the media got attacked up there, didn't they?
[02:41:44.060 --> 02:41:47.382]  Yeah, people had rocks thrown through their windows and all kinds of stuff.
[02:41:47.462 --> 02:41:56.226]  And since then, I guess they've stopped hyping it quite a bit because actually we were flying in, we got in late last night and we were looking on our phones trying to find some news and we couldn't find any news.
[02:41:56.286 --> 02:41:58.187]  It was like everybody pulled out that we got here.
[02:41:58.267 --> 02:42:02.149]  It was just us and maybe one or two other guys out here covering the story.
[02:42:02.209 --> 02:42:05.010]  So they've really eased up on the way that they're covering it.
[02:42:05.610 --> 02:42:08.332]  And to a large extent, you know, things have cooled down.
[02:42:08.352 --> 02:42:09.573]  You've seen the result of that.
[02:42:09.873 --> 02:42:12.975]  Now, since you got there, you may not have seen this, but you guys are great newshounds.
[02:42:14.096 --> 02:42:15.777]  More George Soros emails hacked.
[02:42:16.418 --> 02:42:19.560]  They're clearly behind the immigrant waves to destabilize Europe, the U.S.
[02:42:19.860 --> 02:42:21.161]  They admit the whole plan.
[02:42:21.181 --> 02:42:22.642]  This is a political operation.
[02:42:22.682 --> 02:42:24.343]  We already knew that, but wow!
[02:42:25.364 --> 02:42:27.706]  What else has to come out on George Soros, Shaqiri?
[02:42:28.809 --> 02:42:32.011]  Well, I think the problem is a lot of people don't understand that they're being manipulated.
[02:42:32.171 --> 02:42:35.212]  You know, because you're intellectual enough to understand this, but a lot of people don't.
[02:42:35.412 --> 02:42:39.514]  You know, they just hear, you know, the slogans or, you know, whatever it is that he does to entice them.
[02:42:39.774 --> 02:42:44.056]  You know, come out here and protest, get paid $50, whatever the fee is, and they go out and do that.
[02:42:44.096 --> 02:42:52.000]  They don't really understand the man that they're operating with, and I think if more people understood that, they would be more apprehensive to sign up with a guy like George Soros.
[02:42:53.221 --> 02:42:57.763]  I just can't believe there's a real live comic book character that's, like, worse than stuff I read in comic books.
[02:42:59.418 --> 02:43:00.379]  Yeah, he's not a good guy.
[02:43:01.319 --> 02:43:02.440]  That's what I was making.
[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:08.183]  If people understood who this guy is, you know, because they may have various issues in the community with, you know, this group or that group.
[02:43:08.203 --> 02:43:13.725]  But if they understood who that individual was, I think a lot of this stuff would cease very quickly.
[02:43:13.765 --> 02:43:19.528]  And of course, you got the agitators, you got the communists who come down to various communities, try to stir stuff up, and they're always going to do that.
[02:43:19.809 --> 02:43:24.311]  But they wouldn't have as many people following them if they understood what exactly the agenda was.
[02:43:24.611 --> 02:43:27.392]  Sure, I've studied Joseph McCarthy pretty in-depth.
[02:43:27.432 --> 02:43:33.916]  I mean, I'm not a super expert, but I've probably read, let's not exaggerate, ten books or more about him from enemies and supporters.
[02:43:33.976 --> 02:43:35.576]  I've looked at the Congressional record.
[02:43:35.937 --> 02:43:40.339]  The Soviets in the last twenty years, you know, as that empire declined, have declassified a lot.
[02:43:40.359 --> 02:43:41.119]  Turns out he was right.
[02:43:41.139 --> 02:43:43.821]  A lot of elite foundations and things in the U.S.
[02:43:43.941 --> 02:43:48.803]  and England and Europe, France, were funding the Communists, so there was that back-and-forth deal.
[02:43:49.083 --> 02:43:52.345]  They were kind of using Russia to go invade countries that they couldn't convince.
[02:43:53.085 --> 02:43:53.705]  We're good to go.
[02:44:16.116 --> 02:44:17.617]  I mean, at a certain point, it's like the KKK.
[02:44:17.717 --> 02:44:22.140]  It's like, okay, you have a right to exist, but the minute you call for violence, I want you arrested.
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:23.340]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[02:44:23.961 --> 02:44:27.183]  But, like, it seems like the communists just get away with whatever they want.
[02:44:27.803 --> 02:44:34.527]  And at a certain point, how long do we put up with, like, airs still walking around, not in prison, Jokari?
[02:44:34.547 --> 02:44:38.790]  I mean, when is a group a foreign agitating organization?
[02:44:39.050 --> 02:44:41.351]  I mean, Russia has banned Soros inside their country.
[02:44:41.631 --> 02:44:42.692]  I can find no fault with that.
[02:44:43.874 --> 02:44:45.515]  Do we just let these groups do anything?
[02:44:45.855 --> 02:44:49.696]  Is there any point at which these groups are no longer operating under the law, Jokari?
[02:44:50.616 --> 02:44:53.917]  Well, you know as well as I do, Alex, a lot of people come out here and agitate.
[02:44:53.957 --> 02:44:59.819]  Those are some of the most cowardly people that we see, whether it's at the abortion rally we went to or other things that we experienced.
[02:44:59.839 --> 02:45:08.742]  You know, skinny college kids who want to come out there and kick up stuff, and then when you stand up to them, they just run away and go hide back in the cave and crawl over trash cans in their skinny jeans.
[02:45:09.202 --> 02:45:20.311]  But the issue is that they are so popular amongst, you know, whatever group of people who think that they're in the right, they feel very empowered to go out and do these things, and that's what the issue is.
[02:45:20.351 --> 02:45:34.082]  If they understood how ridiculous they are, and I think a lot of them will look back at those videos, you know, 10, 20 years from now and be quite embarrassed, but for the time being, they think that's the thing to do, and it's almost a social problem that they think that this is the way to help the country by burning it down.
[02:45:34.102 --> 02:45:34.703]  No, I agree with you.
[02:45:35.023 --> 02:45:41.546]  But I don't care if it's a right-wing group, or a Klan group, or a Hispanic group, or a black group, or a communist group, or a whatever group.
[02:45:41.986 --> 02:45:44.747]  When you start... Let me ask Hagman this, then come back to Jakari.
[02:45:45.187 --> 02:45:50.310]  Doug, you know, you've trained thousands of police officers, FBI, you know, with your intelligence network group.
[02:45:51.990 --> 02:45:55.792]  I mean, obviously, there's a point where it's firing... And I'm all for free speech, 100%.
[02:45:56.872 --> 02:46:01.935]  But when you start organizing... If I organize, which I don't want to, because it's not effective, I don't want to do it.
[02:46:03.211 --> 02:46:12.978]  If I started organizing the type of things I see communists doing, or BLM doing, or the George Soros white kids getting off the buses saying, bang bang, oink oink, dead cops, deck the halls with dead cops.
[02:46:13.478 --> 02:46:18.862]  When you're there at an event calling for dead police, you're not in free speech, you're organizing an event.
[02:46:19.242 --> 02:46:20.623]  If police were running around...
[02:46:21.704 --> 02:46:24.646]  Chanting, let's kill citizens, I'd say arrest their ass, you know?
[02:46:24.666 --> 02:46:29.730]  I mean, there's a certain point where the left is allowed to do things nobody else is.
[02:46:29.790 --> 02:46:33.433]  And again, I'm not mad like, I want to organize violence, why can't I?
[02:46:33.613 --> 02:46:34.654]  I don't want to organize it.
[02:46:34.894 --> 02:46:40.118]  But I watch them doing things that is calls to action, organizing violence.
[02:46:40.698 --> 02:46:42.880]  They have a name for it, it's racketeering, isn't it?
[02:46:43.755 --> 02:46:44.755]  Well, of course.
[02:46:44.776 --> 02:46:51.158]  I mean, on a federal level, you've got the Crimes Code, the state level too, and the local level.
[02:46:51.739 --> 02:47:00.323]  You're seeing this being violated, flagrantly violated by these groups, whereas if you and I did this, it would be, we wouldn't even get off the ground.
[02:47:00.403 --> 02:47:01.923]  We wouldn't even get out of the planning stage.
[02:47:02.004 --> 02:47:04.705]  If I called for this stuff in one hour, the police would be here.
[02:47:05.265 --> 02:47:06.046]  Right, exactly.
[02:47:06.066 --> 02:47:15.892]  So, and this is, I mean, certainly this is how we see and how we can identify the infiltrated... We can see the Justice Department is protecting it!
[02:47:16.592 --> 02:47:17.333]  Of course, of course.
[02:47:17.853 --> 02:47:18.833]  You're right, right.
[02:47:19.194 --> 02:47:26.558]  So, I mean, this seditious activity that violates, you know, the federal, state, local laws that can be stopped isn't stopped.
[02:47:27.059 --> 02:47:29.060]  And I guess... Give it the word, it is sedition.
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:30.440]  Very, yeah.
[02:47:30.700 --> 02:47:32.181]  Traitors, sedition, whatever.
[02:47:33.021 --> 02:47:33.641]  Absolutely.
[02:47:33.981 --> 02:47:37.042]  Because you're talking about overthrowing the government.
[02:47:37.102 --> 02:47:40.823]  You're talking about the mass murdering of innocent people.
[02:47:40.843 --> 02:47:42.284]  You're talking about conspiracy.
[02:47:42.824 --> 02:47:47.805]  The actual act of conspiracy with others to engage in seditious acts.
[02:47:47.846 --> 02:47:48.946]  So, all of this.
[02:47:48.966 --> 02:47:51.006]  Yeah, I mean, this is pretty clear.
[02:47:51.046 --> 02:47:51.547]  It's pretty basic.
[02:47:53.747 --> 02:48:03.252]  We're facing foreign, multinational billionaires engaging in fomenting seditious rebellion and overthrow of our country, just like Soros has done in dozens of countries.
[02:48:03.372 --> 02:48:05.573]  I cannot believe he's allowed to operate.
[02:48:05.833 --> 02:48:08.275]  Jakari Jackson, I keep going back to Soros, and he's emblematic.
[02:48:08.515 --> 02:48:09.675]  He's only one of these kingpins.
[02:48:09.996 --> 02:48:13.697]  Carlos Slim, with all of his weird corruption and all the corporate welfare he gets.
[02:48:14.078 --> 02:48:15.158]  Richest man in the world.
[02:48:15.598 --> 02:48:16.399]  Runs Mexico.
[02:48:17.543 --> 02:48:18.664]  He owns the New York Times.
[02:48:18.985 --> 02:48:20.806]  He's pushing gun control here in America.
[02:48:21.127 --> 02:48:22.929]  People go, what, are you against him because he's a Mexican?
[02:48:23.149 --> 02:48:24.150]  He's not even a Mexican!
[02:48:24.170 --> 02:48:24.991]  He's Lebanese!
[02:48:25.011 --> 02:48:26.412]  I'm not against Lebanese either.
[02:48:26.692 --> 02:48:28.234]  The point is, he's a parasite.
[02:48:28.574 --> 02:48:29.635]  He wants my guns.
[02:48:30.116 --> 02:48:35.722]  And what is he doing in my country being the number two financer of gun control after Michael Bloomberg?
[02:48:36.022 --> 02:48:37.604]  I'm fundamentally pissed, Jakari.
[02:48:38.939 --> 02:48:39.599]  Well, absolutely.
[02:48:39.639 --> 02:48:40.640]  People don't like this.
[02:48:40.700 --> 02:48:42.280]  I think we see more and more people waking up.
[02:48:42.300 --> 02:48:44.802]  There's actually a video that we're going to post here in a little bit.
[02:48:45.202 --> 02:48:46.422]  Actually, I don't know if we said this on camera.
[02:48:46.442 --> 02:48:52.845]  We were talking to a lady a little bit ago, and she may have said this after we got off camera, but she was saying that you guys need to be prepared.
[02:48:52.865 --> 02:48:54.246]  She's like, what are you guys doing to get prepared?
[02:48:54.306 --> 02:48:57.907]  And we got food, we got bullets, and we got water.
[02:48:57.927 --> 02:48:58.907]  And then she gave us a high five.
[02:48:59.168 --> 02:48:59.708]  And it's just a
[02:49:00.308 --> 02:49:01.488]  Normal lady here in the community.
[02:49:01.508 --> 02:49:25.754]  She doesn't you know, she's not an extremist or anything else But she understands that you need to have a means to defend yourself and also a means to provide for yourself I was about to say there's a total distortion Along so-called race lines and when it is true, we're all one race We all got red blood all the same genetics at the end of the day our differences is less than one tenth of one percent It's all cosmetic in the spectrum of humanity But when you look at this
[02:49:27.230 --> 02:49:30.536]  The average person just wants freedom and just wants to have a future.
[02:49:30.997 --> 02:49:37.489]  And that's what's so sad and what makes me so angry is that our enemies play us off against each other because it's the only way they can win, Jakari.
[02:49:38.655 --> 02:49:39.656]  Yeah, that's what they do.
[02:49:39.696 --> 02:49:40.416]  Divide and conquer.
[02:49:40.436 --> 02:49:41.377]  That's their best strategy.
[02:49:41.397 --> 02:49:50.244]  If they understand that people are unified, they understand that people can put aside these petty issues like they did in places like Charleston, they won't have these big riots.
[02:49:50.304 --> 02:49:57.350]  And notice they shut the media down once it showed whites, blacks, Hispanics all hugging at prayer vigils and coming together.
[02:49:57.710 --> 02:49:59.612]  Soon as that happened, they just shut that coverage down.
[02:50:00.352 --> 02:50:02.293]  They said, well, that's not what we came here to see.
[02:50:02.313 --> 02:50:07.915]  Like I said, they don't want to see the people, thousands of people across the bridge out there in Charleston, hugging, singing songs and all that.
[02:50:08.195 --> 02:50:12.917]  And I think if more of those things could happen and get the good publicity, then a lot of these things would stop.
[02:50:13.622 --> 02:50:15.084]  Absolutely, Jakari.
[02:50:15.365 --> 02:50:15.925]  Well, thank you.
[02:50:15.945 --> 02:50:19.590]  We're going to come back and do one segment with Rob Dew, with Mr. Hagman as well.
[02:50:20.451 --> 02:50:25.017]  So we're going to get the news director's take on what he's been witnessing and more straight ahead.
[02:50:25.057 --> 02:50:26.159]  I have not plugged this hour.
[02:50:26.579 --> 02:50:30.344]  All I'm going to say is 20% off the natural defense.
[02:50:31.285 --> 02:50:33.027]  Living Defense is simply amazing.
[02:50:33.528 --> 02:50:34.689]  This is a detox.
[02:50:34.769 --> 02:50:38.473]  This is a system that goes after the parasites that are in most people's guts.
[02:50:38.994 --> 02:50:40.475]  And it's really helped myself and others.
[02:50:40.515 --> 02:50:41.777]  Your purchase funds the operation.

[02:50:56.819 --> 02:50:58.140]  That makes it all possible.
[02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:01.521]  The New World Order hates this model of not operating off sponsors.
[02:51:01.541 --> 02:51:02.262]  The networks do.
[02:51:03.622 --> 02:51:05.663]  Your local stations do to support those sponsors.
[02:51:05.963 --> 02:51:09.245]  We operate self-funded with great products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:51:13.124 --> 02:51:16.287]  You said in a speech today you're afraid this election is going to be rigged.
[02:51:16.627 --> 02:51:18.369]  I've been hearing about it for a long time.
[02:51:18.509 --> 02:51:21.332]  I hope the Republicans get out there and watch very closely.
[02:51:21.372 --> 02:51:23.994]  This new poll is showing a big convention balance for Hillary Clinton.
[02:51:24.094 --> 02:51:28.138]  Following her nomination at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton now leads it.
[02:51:28.438 --> 02:51:30.400]  Donald Trump, 50% to 42%.
[02:51:30.460 --> 02:51:33.182]  That's a 7 point jump from last week.
[02:51:33.282 --> 02:51:35.724]  You see, he's supposed to just sit there and let them steal it.
[02:51:35.905 --> 02:51:37.466]  But he didn't sit there, so they failed.
[02:51:39.102 --> 02:51:46.107]  And they think they're gonna have another stolen general election in front of everybody at high noon, and we're just gonna sit here and go along with it.
[02:51:46.267 --> 02:51:46.608]  We're not.
[02:51:47.682 --> 02:51:48.402]  I'm gonna fight it.
[02:51:48.643 --> 02:51:49.503]  Trump's gonna fight it.
[02:51:49.743 --> 02:51:50.443]  You're gonna fight it.
[02:51:50.603 --> 02:51:52.564]  Bob Mulholland from Chico, California.
[02:51:52.604 --> 02:51:55.866]  I'm a DNC member, thus a superdelegate to the National Convention.
[02:51:56.146 --> 02:51:56.907]  First of all, it's rigged.
[02:51:57.487 --> 02:52:00.008]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[02:52:00.628 --> 02:52:05.491]  And the way we work is that anybody who gets 15% more in an election gets delegates.
[02:52:05.651 --> 02:52:07.652]  So this election will go all the way to California.
[02:52:07.992 --> 02:52:11.714]  Sanders will end up with well over a thousand delegates and Hillary will get the nomination.
[02:52:11.954 --> 02:52:20.641]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[02:52:20.761 --> 02:52:21.702]  It has been rigged.
[02:52:21.842 --> 02:52:33.571]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and largely to
[02:52:34.391 --> 02:52:44.480]  If Hillary steals the nomination, and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[02:52:44.860 --> 02:52:47.682]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[02:52:48.623 --> 02:52:50.124]  Contrary to popular belief.
[02:52:50.484 --> 02:52:52.026]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[02:52:53.015 --> 02:52:54.076]  That's a very good question.
[02:52:54.277 --> 02:52:58.121]  WikiLeaks has dumped nearly 20,000 hacked emails from the DNC.
[02:52:58.181 --> 02:53:05.349]  We're talking about the report of leaked DNC emails showing an effort to undermine Bernie Sanders during the primaries.
[02:53:05.690 --> 02:53:10.055]  The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.
[02:53:10.755 --> 02:53:15.717]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[02:53:15.777 --> 02:53:16.778]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[02:53:17.018 --> 02:53:20.720]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[02:53:21.040 --> 02:53:21.960]  And guess what there is?
[02:53:22.180 --> 02:53:24.061]  She stole the nomination.
[02:53:24.361 --> 02:53:27.082]  I want to thank Bernie Sanders.
[02:53:28.083 --> 02:53:32.905]  If he would have just not done anything, just go home, go to sleep, relax, he would have been a hero.
[02:53:33.105 --> 02:53:34.826]  But he made a deal with the devil.
[02:53:34.846 --> 02:53:35.446]  She's the devil.
[02:53:35.786 --> 02:53:36.827]  He made a deal with the devil.
[02:53:38.451 --> 02:53:42.874]  The media has created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination, and that's the concept.
[02:53:42.914 --> 02:53:44.255]  That's the conflict here.
[02:53:44.295 --> 02:53:46.256]  We feel like we live in a democratic society.
[02:53:46.276 --> 02:53:51.580]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation.
[02:53:51.680 --> 02:53:53.941]  Crooked Hillary thinks they're gonna pull the lid on Mitt Romney?
[02:53:54.302 --> 02:53:54.942]  Mm, lady.
[02:53:55.362 --> 02:53:56.083]  Isn't gonna happen.
[02:53:56.283 --> 02:54:01.406]  That's why her campaign head, her chief strategist said, this is dangerous what Trump's doing.
[02:54:01.787 --> 02:54:03.188]  You're right, it is dangerous, isn't it?
[02:54:03.848 --> 02:54:05.149]  Actually standing up to you.
[02:54:05.409 --> 02:54:07.991]  There has to come a point at which you say, enough.
[02:54:12.675 --> 02:54:15.377]  This is scary sometimes, exhilarating as well.
[02:54:15.437 --> 02:54:18.059]  Just thank God you're not on the side of the New World Order.
[02:54:18.079 --> 02:54:20.061]  Can you imagine being one of these people's minions?
[02:54:21.782 --> 02:54:23.624]  And having to have a sick feeling inside your soul?
[02:54:25.385 --> 02:54:26.126]  I war game things.
[02:54:26.166 --> 02:54:27.767]  I look at things in the perspective of the enemy.
[02:54:27.867 --> 02:54:31.390]  When I get in their perspective, ugh, it does not feel good to my soul.
[02:54:32.451 --> 02:54:35.894]  So don't fear he who can kill the body, but he who can destroy the soul.
[02:54:38.533 --> 02:54:41.374]  I want to take some phone calls here in a little bit of the next hour with our guest.
[02:54:42.174 --> 02:54:43.114]  Hagman at Hagman.com.
[02:54:43.134 --> 02:54:44.475]  Check out his own radio and TV show.
[02:54:44.515 --> 02:54:45.035]  It's excellent.
[02:54:46.255 --> 02:54:47.235]  Just amazing information.
[02:54:47.275 --> 02:54:48.376]  Very humble man, Doug Hagman.
[02:54:48.416 --> 02:54:48.836]  Smart guy.
[02:54:48.856 --> 02:54:49.596]  A lot of great sources.
[02:54:50.016 --> 02:54:52.377]  Paul Watson taking over in about 15 minutes from London.
[02:54:52.397 --> 02:54:57.558]  But let's go to, real quick, to the news director, who's also running camera, Rob Dew.
[02:54:58.018 --> 02:55:01.599]  What is your takeaway from what you're seeing happening there in Milwaukee?
[02:55:01.999 --> 02:55:03.440]  The Trump event coming up tonight.
[02:55:03.460 --> 02:55:06.741]  We're going to have live coverage during the nightly news, 7 o'clock central.
[02:55:07.301 --> 02:55:07.661]  Rob Dew.
[02:55:08.683 --> 02:55:14.645]  Well, Alex, I just want to make a point here of what you were talking about earlier, how the media wants to see death and destruction and exploit that.
[02:55:14.925 --> 02:55:15.945]  Ja'Kari, turn the camera over here.
[02:55:16.325 --> 02:55:20.727]  You got three mainstream media cameras, and they're all pointed at the burnt-out building.
[02:55:20.767 --> 02:55:24.008]  Now, we did shoot some footage of that earlier, but all of them are pointed over there.
[02:55:24.288 --> 02:55:24.828]  We're over here.
[02:55:25.028 --> 02:55:30.650]  Our backdrop is people having picnics, getting along, coming out here, trying to make... Rob, dude, this is a first.
[02:55:31.010 --> 02:55:32.910]  How delicious is that toothpick in your mouth right now?
[02:55:34.271 --> 02:55:34.751]  The toothpick?
[02:55:35.956 --> 02:55:36.816]  I'm not even mad.
[02:55:36.896 --> 02:55:39.478]  I just love how laid back you are with the toothpick in your mouth.
[02:55:39.498 --> 02:55:39.778]  Go ahead.
[02:55:40.858 --> 02:55:42.779]  I don't have a toothpick in my mouth, but that's alright.
[02:55:43.059 --> 02:55:44.180]  You do have a toothpick.
[02:55:44.220 --> 02:55:44.640]  I see it.
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:47.821]  Well, if you want to make a point of it, I'll get real up close.
[02:55:48.021 --> 02:55:51.203]  This is sunburn from- Oh my gosh, I apologize.
[02:55:51.463 --> 02:55:52.543]  It was a distortion.
[02:55:52.803 --> 02:55:53.704]  I'm not mad at you.
[02:55:53.764 --> 02:55:55.044]  I love the fact you have a toothpick.
[02:55:55.424 --> 02:55:57.065]  I think I was broadcasting with a toothpick.
[02:55:57.085 --> 02:55:57.745]  Sorry.
[02:55:58.306 --> 02:55:59.606]  Yeah, I've been dealing with it all day.
[02:55:59.926 --> 02:56:00.827]  Or for the last three days.
[02:56:00.887 --> 02:56:01.547]  I apologize.
[02:56:02.207 --> 02:56:03.068]  I was not bitching at you.
[02:56:03.088 --> 02:56:03.648]  I thought it was funny.
[02:56:04.505 --> 02:56:06.147]  No, no, I just wanted to show you.
[02:56:06.167 --> 02:56:07.448]  Hey, I look like Bob's big boy.
[02:56:07.468 --> 02:56:11.032]  Hey, does it not look like a toothpick at a distance?
[02:56:11.112 --> 02:56:12.334]  What I'm trying to do is hide it.
[02:56:13.393 --> 02:56:13.813]  Like this?
[02:56:14.194 --> 02:56:14.514]  It's okay.
[02:56:14.534 --> 02:56:15.495]  It looks tasty, actually.
[02:56:15.775 --> 02:56:16.977]  Is it caramel flavored?
[02:56:17.217 --> 02:56:19.459]  You got people out here, Alex, selling water.
[02:56:19.940 --> 02:56:24.424]  You got a group out here drumming, trying to raise money for their group to go out and perform.
[02:56:24.444 --> 02:56:27.968]  This guy's one-man army is trying to take kids off the street, teach them a skill.
[02:56:28.388 --> 02:56:29.510]  You know, he was a high school drummer.
[02:56:29.530 --> 02:56:30.911]  He's like, I'm going to take kids off the street.
[02:56:31.131 --> 02:56:31.612]  I love it.
[02:56:31.632 --> 02:56:34.955]  So all these people who want to help and stop this are coming to bring joy.
[02:56:35.175 --> 02:56:35.596]  Exactly.
[02:56:35.996 --> 02:56:39.540]  And so maybe it takes an event like this to wake people up and break people out of their trance.
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:41.642]  Sometimes you need events like this.
[02:56:42.163 --> 02:56:50.312]  But I just think it's very interesting how the mainstream media is all focused on the building being torn down and not talking to the regular people out here.
[02:56:50.752 --> 02:56:52.114]  It's just my observation.
[02:56:52.774 --> 02:56:56.699]  From the people we met last night to today, all of them had
[02:56:57.599 --> 02:57:19.049]  A biblical message to add to what they were saying and I think that's pretty important that we have to like start looking at God and his message and what's in the Bible to to find guidance and direction in these things because people are running around without guidance and direction and this is what you get when you don't have guidance and direction and a lot of people are saying it's the adult's responsibility to take control of the kids to make sure you know they're not sitting in the park.
[02:57:19.089 --> 02:57:20.470]  I like what Sheriff Clark said about all this.
[02:57:20.490 --> 02:57:24.732]  You know we can deal with the police later but how about dealing with the ghetto problem because
[02:57:25.552 --> 02:57:28.198]  You know, that's an issue and the poverty is getting worse for everybody.
[02:57:28.218 --> 02:57:29.861]  It's a very sad situation.
[02:57:29.881 --> 02:57:31.064]  Well, you're going to be there tonight.
[02:57:31.104 --> 02:57:32.948]  Tell folks where this is taking place with Trump.
[02:57:33.686 --> 02:57:35.207]  Yeah, it's going to be at West Bend.
[02:57:35.247 --> 02:57:37.789]  I don't have the exact address in front of me, but we're going to be there.
[02:57:37.809 --> 02:57:40.290]  We're actually going to leave here in about 15 minutes and head up that way.
[02:57:40.310 --> 02:57:47.394]  We've got some videos to upload, some stuff to put together, and yeah, we're going to see if there's any rollover from this.
[02:57:47.454 --> 02:57:52.137]  Maybe the operatives will come in and they're just waiting to spring on Trump, because last night it was pretty quiet here.
[02:57:52.477 --> 02:57:53.898]  The police had this place locked down.
[02:57:53.958 --> 02:58:02.343]  We went to another location that they were going to be at, and it's going to be in West Bend at the Ziegler Building in Washington County at the Fair Park and Conference Center.
[02:58:02.383 --> 02:58:03.164]  That's about 45 minutes away?
[02:58:03.584 --> 02:58:05.465]  Ben, Wisconsin starts at 7.30 tonight.
[02:58:05.906 --> 02:58:10.169]  We're going to be there in less than two hours, so we want to see all the people out there.
[02:58:10.209 --> 02:58:15.793]  Hopefully a nice positive event, but if there's agitators out there, we will get them on film and we will expose them.
[02:58:15.953 --> 02:58:18.915]  Well, you are awesome, and I meant it light-hearted about the toothpick.
[02:58:18.935 --> 02:58:23.719]  I didn't realize you had a big sunburn spot, so I put my foot in my own mouth.
[02:58:24.159 --> 02:58:25.220]  Great job, you and the crew.
[02:58:26.180 --> 02:58:26.380]  All right.
[02:58:26.701 --> 02:58:29.923]  Rob, you're reporting from Milwaukee, Wisconsin for InfoWars.com.
[02:58:29.943 --> 02:58:30.143]  All right.
[02:58:30.283 --> 02:58:31.063]  All right.
[02:58:31.083 --> 02:58:31.744]  All right.
[02:58:32.484 --> 02:58:40.049]  We're going to come back in 70 seconds, take a few calls, get final comments from Mr. Hagman, and then we're going to hand the baton to Paul Josephine Watson.
[02:58:40.589 --> 02:58:42.070]  Paul Joseph Watson, while I'm having some fun.
[02:58:42.290 --> 02:58:43.231]  You know I love the crew.
[02:58:43.271 --> 02:58:45.392]  We all just joke with each other behind the scenes.
[02:58:46.473 --> 02:58:47.314]  InfoWars.com.
[02:58:47.354 --> 02:58:49.095]  The Newel Order doesn't want that website out, folks.
[02:58:49.375 --> 02:58:50.316]  We are teleprompter free.
[02:58:50.356 --> 02:58:50.736]  Remember that.

[02:59:00.475 --> 02:59:02.396]  Article from the Associated Press.
[02:59:02.656 --> 02:59:10.901]  A Chicago-based communist revolutionary group was blamed by Milwaukee's police chief for stoking a second day of violence.
[02:59:11.361 --> 02:59:20.266]  Police Chief Ed Flynn said members of a Chicago chapter of the Revolutionary Communist Party turned what had been a peaceful night into a tense one.
[02:59:20.706 --> 02:59:25.109]  TV footage showed a small group of protesters walking or running through the streets.
[02:59:25.349 --> 02:59:39.438]  The fatal police shooting of a 23-year-old black man, Savelle Smith, touched off a weekend of tense and at times violent protests that left at least six businesses burned and several officers injured by flying objects Saturday night.
[02:59:39.638 --> 02:59:45.562]  Fourteen people were arrested overnight, and three police officers and four sheriff's deputies were injured.
[02:59:46.201 --> 02:59:48.642]  InfoWars has its team on the ground.
[02:59:48.982 --> 02:59:53.665]  News Director Rob Dew has already filmed communist recruitment signage.
[02:59:53.985 --> 02:59:57.666]  Go to InfoWars.com for breaking news on Milwaukee.
[03:00:02.449 --> 03:00:05.110]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:17.209 --> 03:00:19.192]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[03:00:20.052 --> 03:00:21.354]  Broadcasting Worldwide.
[03:00:21.774 --> 03:00:24.938]  Live from the Infowars.com studios.
[03:00:25.098 --> 03:00:26.459]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.025 --> 03:00:32.666]  I want to get Doug Hagman on sometime about his great book, Stained by Blood, a murder investigation.
[03:00:32.686 --> 03:00:33.707]  I've heard a lot about that book.
[03:00:34.187 --> 03:00:36.707]  And I want to get him on as a contributor whenever he wants to the Nightly News.
[03:00:36.747 --> 03:00:38.088]  This guy shouldn't just come on every few months.
[03:00:38.708 --> 03:00:40.828]  I'm going to get James Wesley Rawls on.
[03:00:40.848 --> 03:00:42.569]  All these great people we don't get on often enough.
[03:00:43.429 --> 03:00:48.070]  But I want to go to your phone calls too, Anna and Josephine and Jason and Dan and Carlos.
[03:00:48.390 --> 03:00:50.991]  I'll get to all of you before I hand the baton to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:00:51.731 --> 03:00:55.192]  But any other tidbits you want to add as we take a few calls here?
[03:00:57.495 --> 03:01:07.579]  Just that you're right on, you know, it's interesting the appearance in Wisconsin, what you showed versus what the mainstream media is focusing on.
[03:01:08.139 --> 03:01:12.481]  I think we need more of that and we need to understand too, and this is where
[03:01:13.521 --> 03:01:18.903]  I, myself, as a Christian, and to my Christian audience, we need to fill in the gap.
[03:01:18.983 --> 03:01:23.004]  We need to have a presence because, again, failure to act on our part.
[03:01:23.444 --> 03:01:40.489]  We have a responsibility to really stand in the gap and to be a force multiplier for the good as opposed to allowing the bad to run roughshod over us, whether it be the alien invasion from ISIS or the globalist tyranny or
[03:01:41.209 --> 03:01:48.739]  Whatever it might be, but I think the dynamic that you showed... People coming together.
[03:01:48.799 --> 03:01:50.101]  You wouldn't see that on mainstream media.
[03:01:50.681 --> 03:01:51.202]  Exactly.
[03:01:51.562 --> 03:01:53.625]  And the other thing you said, too, about McCarthy.
[03:01:54.446 --> 03:01:57.951]  I'm a big history buff about McCarthy.
[03:01:58.631 --> 03:02:11.220]  I think people would be surprised to learn just very quickly that even into the 1990s, much of McCarthy's findings from the National Archives were being expunged by the people who are in power right now, the globalists.
[03:02:11.801 --> 03:02:23.208]  And I would urge people to really understand the infiltration that we suffered post-World War II by the Communists and even the Democratic National Socialists into America and how that's playing out today.
[03:02:23.289 --> 03:02:25.190]  So thank you for allowing me to say that.
[03:02:25.470 --> 03:02:26.070]  Absolutely.
[03:02:26.090 --> 03:02:28.271]  Let's talk to Anna in Kentucky.
[03:02:28.291 --> 03:02:29.452]  You're on the air with Doug Hagman.
[03:02:29.472 --> 03:02:31.913]  Go ahead.
[03:02:32.033 --> 03:02:32.333]  Hi, Alex.
[03:02:32.473 --> 03:02:33.374]  Thanks for what you do.
[03:02:35.355 --> 03:02:42.058]  My question is, since Soros and the big banks have so much control over the government,
[03:02:42.694 --> 03:02:46.756]  How is there any possible way that Trump can even win this election?
[03:02:46.996 --> 03:02:53.139]  If we all just wake up and know they're the enemy, and spread the word to people, and don't just debate them, you'll go, look, you're being conned.
[03:02:53.620 --> 03:02:56.581]  You know, Trump is the anti-globalist, enough people will vote for a landslide.
[03:02:56.861 --> 03:02:58.902]  But Trump wins just by injecting real issues.
[03:02:58.962 --> 03:03:02.444]  Even if he loses, the globalists are in trouble.
[03:03:02.464 --> 03:03:04.245]  Their whole agenda is being exposed.
[03:03:07.427 --> 03:03:07.567]  True.
[03:03:09.366 --> 03:03:15.050]  And my son wants me to ask you, he is actually the one that has introduced you to us.
[03:03:15.490 --> 03:03:35.945]  Um, and we, um, we were just kind of leaning blindly, you know, in this world, um, and until this past election, um, he is wondering if you, in your opinion, do you think Hillary Clinton had to bow to mull up to get to
[03:03:37.023 --> 03:03:39.246]  Are you saying, do I think she's too ill to be that?
[03:03:48.206 --> 03:03:51.389]  Well, I mean, I don't think there's any doubt that Hillary Clinton is into the occult.
[03:03:51.969 --> 03:03:53.851]  I've read books about it, seen photos.
[03:03:54.251 --> 03:03:58.815]  I mean, I've covered what she does, and most of these elites, and I didn't believe this 20 years ago.
[03:03:58.995 --> 03:04:01.056]  I got into this and just did research.
[03:04:01.156 --> 03:04:02.698]  Most of them are into the occult.
[03:04:03.158 --> 03:04:08.502]  They're obsessed with the occult, and there's no doubt Hillary Clinton is an extremely wicked woman.
[03:04:08.562 --> 03:04:10.404]  God bless you, and God bless your son, Anna.
[03:04:11.345 --> 03:04:13.626]  In your own research, Doug, I'm going to ask you this question.
[03:04:13.887 --> 03:04:16.369]  Have you run into the occult when researching the globalists?
[03:04:16.934 --> 03:04:19.816]  Oh yeah, absolutely Alex, and you're right on the money with this.
[03:04:20.196 --> 03:04:31.784]  People won't believe it, I didn't believe it, but absolutely that there is a level, well the Luciferian elite, and if anyone has any doubt, Rules for Radicals dedicated to Lucifer, come on.
[03:04:31.804 --> 03:04:34.887]  That's Hillary's Bible, dedicated to Lucifer.
[03:04:35.407 --> 03:04:37.589]  Right, so I mean, she's everywhere.
[03:04:38.029 --> 03:04:38.950]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:04:39.010 --> 03:04:43.653]  Yeah, pretty soon when it's Lucifer this, Lucifer that, you're like ignoring it, it's just all around you.
[03:04:44.736 --> 03:04:45.256]  Absolutely.
[03:04:45.276 --> 03:04:46.056]  Yep.
[03:04:46.637 --> 03:04:48.517]  Alright, well, Doug, thank you so much.
[03:04:48.577 --> 03:04:50.238]  I'd love to come on your program anytime.
[03:04:50.518 --> 03:04:51.278]  You and your whole team.
[03:04:51.678 --> 03:04:54.639]  No, no, I know you're a busy guy, and you've invited me before and have, but I'd love to come on.
[03:04:54.919 --> 03:04:55.880]  Your work is so important.
[03:04:55.920 --> 03:04:57.020]  Thank you so much for all you do.
[03:04:57.700 --> 03:04:58.380]  God bless you, Alex.
[03:04:58.400 --> 03:04:59.261]  Thanks for having me on.
[03:04:59.341 --> 03:04:59.961]  Really appreciate it.
[03:05:00.001 --> 03:05:00.541]  No, we appreciate you.
[03:05:00.561 --> 03:05:01.561]  You have a lot of courage, my friend.
[03:05:01.581 --> 03:05:04.742]  Alright, we're gonna come back and hand the baton to Paul Watson after a few calls.
[03:05:04.802 --> 03:05:05.483]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:05.903 --> 03:05:07.423]  This is The Info.
[03:05:07.863 --> 03:05:09.504]  Humanity's desperate attempt to fight back.
[03:05:14.338 --> 03:05:21.803]  On July 30th, Alex Jones made a request that Donald Trump make rigged elections one of the central campaign issues.
[03:05:22.544 --> 03:05:27.888]  On August 1st, Donald Trump went on Sean Hannity and spoke with Sean about rigged elections.
[03:05:28.709 --> 03:05:35.153]  Vladimir Putin came out a few days later and spoke about how American elections have been rigged in the past.
[03:05:35.754 --> 03:05:37.355]  Here's a recap of those events.
[03:05:37.975 --> 03:05:41.018]  Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out here that you don't already know.
[03:05:41.958 --> 03:05:54.866]  But I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election fraud in the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[03:05:55.227 --> 03:05:59.249]  And I'm telling you, November 8th, we better be careful because that election's gonna be rigged.
[03:05:59.389 --> 03:06:00.170]  First of all, it's rigged.
[03:06:00.730 --> 03:06:03.252]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[03:06:03.912 --> 03:06:07.695]  And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us.
[03:06:07.855 --> 03:06:11.278]  America teaches everybody how to live in, quote, democracy.
[03:06:11.838 --> 03:06:12.299]  But what?
[03:06:12.699 --> 03:06:15.661]  You actually believe that they have democratic elections there?
[03:06:16.021 --> 03:06:24.248]  If Hillary steals the nomination and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[03:06:24.748 --> 03:06:33.451]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[03:06:33.551 --> 03:06:34.471]  It has been rigged.
[03:06:34.511 --> 03:06:37.312]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[03:06:38.273 --> 03:06:39.753]  Contrary to popular belief.
[03:06:40.133 --> 03:06:41.674]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[03:06:42.685 --> 03:06:43.885]  That's a very good question.
[03:06:44.025 --> 03:06:58.269]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and marginally to facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[03:06:58.389 --> 03:07:03.331]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[03:07:03.411 --> 03:07:04.371]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[03:07:04.631 --> 03:07:08.356]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[03:07:08.656 --> 03:07:09.538]  And guess what there is?
[03:07:09.798 --> 03:07:11.680]  She stole the nomination!
[03:07:11.921 --> 03:07:14.103]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[03:07:14.184 --> 03:07:14.905]  What does that mean?
[03:07:15.666 --> 03:07:17.527]  How would the party pick a new nominee?
[03:07:17.728 --> 03:07:18.648]  Today is the day!
[03:07:18.708 --> 03:07:22.251]  They're really thinking about maybe getting him off the top of the ticket.
[03:07:22.451 --> 03:07:25.173]  He now looks increasingly like the Kamikaze candidate.
[03:07:25.754 --> 03:07:28.656]  An implosion the likes of which I have never seen.
[03:07:28.676 --> 03:07:31.838]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[03:07:32.479 --> 03:07:43.167]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country...
[03:07:44.955 --> 03:07:47.277]  Including in places like Texas.
[03:07:49.538 --> 03:07:50.158]  That's ridiculous.
[03:07:50.258 --> 03:07:51.259]  That doesn't make any sense.
[03:07:51.339 --> 03:07:53.200]  And I don't think anybody would take that seriously.
[03:07:53.901 --> 03:07:57.263]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars is now controlling the narrative.
[03:07:57.723 --> 03:08:03.267]  Go to InfoWars.com for more information and InfoWarsStore.com to support the fight for truth.
[03:08:32.020 --> 03:08:36.501]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:36.601 --> 03:08:38.641]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:39.121 --> 03:08:41.682]  Everybody else just decided to grovel to the New World Order.
[03:08:41.702 --> 03:08:44.062]  This crazy Texan decided to fight back.
[03:08:44.862 --> 03:08:46.342]  And I had a plan 20 years ago.
[03:08:46.362 --> 03:08:52.183]  Eh, more of a plan about 18 years ago, but always had the plan.
[03:08:52.924 --> 03:08:55.684]  And here we are dealing death blows to the New World Order.
[03:08:55.704 --> 03:09:01.085]  I know there are a lot of men and women better than I, so I need you to join the fight.
[03:09:02.585 --> 03:09:03.806]  I need to get involved today.
[03:09:04.426 --> 03:09:17.955]  And I saw Paul Joseph Watson, about 15, 16 years ago, with his blog, Propagandamatrix.com, and I saw him having a big effect and kind of writing about what I was doing, and I said, I need to hire this guy.
[03:09:18.756 --> 03:09:19.216]  And I did.
[03:09:19.456 --> 03:09:28.042]  And then I pushed him to get on air and everything else, and now, in libertarian news worldwide, Paul Watson doesn't want to brag about it, but he's the hottest commodity out there.
[03:09:28.743 --> 03:09:30.404]  And that's what's exciting about human vision.
[03:09:31.559 --> 03:09:33.800]  And I see the potential in you as well.
[03:09:34.201 --> 03:09:35.761]  We're going to defeat the New World Order.
[03:09:35.822 --> 03:09:38.883]  I mean, look at that hunchback, demon-crowned Hillary.
[03:09:39.564 --> 03:09:41.105]  Stick a fork in her, she's done.
[03:09:42.105 --> 03:09:48.349]  And so, all I can say is that I have a new apprentice, younger and more powerful.
[03:09:48.869 --> 03:09:51.430]  So, Paul Watson, there is a lot going on.
[03:09:51.451 --> 03:09:53.952]  I'm going to take a few calls before I hand the baton to you, because I promise to.
[03:09:54.332 --> 03:09:57.154]  What is coming up today in Planet InfoWars?
[03:09:58.649 --> 03:10:05.795]  Well, we had the backlash, Alex, to the Hillary Health scandal that we really brought back to the fore over the past couple of weeks.
[03:10:05.835 --> 03:10:13.842]  That viral video that I put out on YouTube got, so far, 2.8 million views on YouTube, another couple of million on Facebook.
[03:10:14.222 --> 03:10:16.284]  It sent them into a complete panic.
[03:10:16.804 --> 03:10:20.007]  The problem is, Alex, that Hillary just keeps falling over.
[03:10:20.367 --> 03:10:24.210]  She keeps being caught in these incidents where... She's not young and powerful?
[03:10:24.250 --> 03:10:25.732]  She's not a Jedi leader?
[03:10:27.031 --> 03:10:29.474]  No, she's nearly 70 years old.
[03:10:29.494 --> 03:10:33.277]  You know, John McCain was 71 when he ran for president eight years ago.
[03:10:33.678 --> 03:10:37.281]  At that time, the media was absolutely obsessed with his health.
[03:10:37.762 --> 03:10:42.867]  But if we talk about it in the context of Hillary, we're tinfoil hat-wearing conspiracy theorists.
[03:10:43.528 --> 03:10:44.849]  But I kind of like that attack.
[03:10:44.929 --> 03:10:50.175]  I mean, our intellectual enemies just say, tinfoil, tinfoil, tinfoil, as we rise in the ratings above them and they plunge.
[03:10:52.059 --> 03:10:53.760]  Well, I mean, you can look at the U.S.
[03:10:53.820 --> 03:10:56.321]  media top publishers in July, Alex.
[03:10:56.361 --> 03:10:58.462]  I mean, Drudge had this up yesterday, I think.
[03:10:58.482 --> 03:10:58.923]  Number one.
[03:10:59.863 --> 03:11:01.044]  Well, he's number two.
[03:11:01.084 --> 03:11:02.424]  He's got MSN to beat.
[03:11:02.524 --> 03:11:04.165]  But look at the people who are below him.
[03:11:06.581 --> 03:11:08.822]  But look at the people who Drudge is beating.
[03:11:09.302 --> 03:11:17.927]  Disney Media Networks, Yahoo, Google Inc, Time Warner, Fox, Gannett Company, NBC Universal, Time, New York Times Company.
[03:11:18.287 --> 03:11:21.209]  These companies have thousands of employees.
[03:11:21.529 --> 03:11:23.350]  They're up against one guy.
[03:11:23.410 --> 03:11:25.051]  Obviously, he's got people who help him out.
[03:11:25.471 --> 03:11:28.573]  But one guy who started a website out of his apartment.
[03:11:29.113 --> 03:11:29.353]  True.
[03:11:29.453 --> 03:11:30.334]  I apologize.
[03:11:30.354 --> 03:11:31.474]  The way I read it was number one.
[03:11:31.574 --> 03:11:32.415]  I must have seen another story.
[03:11:32.435 --> 03:11:33.916]  It was like number one news site in the world.
[03:11:33.956 --> 03:11:35.877]  I guess like number two overall in some other aggregator.
[03:11:37.259 --> 03:11:43.522]  If you include MSN, which is a huge conglomeration of different outfits, yeah, he's basically number one.
[03:11:43.842 --> 03:11:46.823]  He's kicking the app, BuzzFeed, kicking their butt.
[03:11:47.343 --> 03:11:49.284]  AOL, kicking their butt.
[03:11:49.704 --> 03:11:55.547]  With one website, that classic look that still looks like it's from the late 90s, which everybody loves.
[03:11:56.287 --> 03:12:03.250]  Absolutely whopping them, because he dares to point to news articles which you're not going to see on Yahoo, on Google, etc.
[03:12:03.850 --> 03:12:06.091]  And they're just incensed with him.
[03:12:06.151 --> 03:12:08.752]  I mean, they write articles about who he links to.
[03:12:09.152 --> 03:12:10.352]  That's how incensed they are.
[03:12:10.692 --> 03:12:17.675]  And he's been the one pushing, again, this Hillary's health scandal, which is why they're terrified about it, which is why more medical experts are coming forward.
[03:12:17.695 --> 03:12:19.616]  But Alexis says he has no visitors.
[03:12:21.376 --> 03:12:23.277]  Love how Amazon gamed that a few years ago.
[03:12:23.297 --> 03:12:25.078]  They're now a total joke with their rating system.
[03:12:26.701 --> 03:12:37.146]  No, I mean, you can put in any website to Alexa, you know, conservative libertarian, it shows that it's plummeted completely at odds with our internal traffic, which shows the complete opposite.
[03:12:38.823 --> 03:12:40.645]  And by the way, we're not web gurus.
[03:12:40.705 --> 03:12:41.986]  We don't know how to set all this up.
[03:12:42.006 --> 03:12:44.048]  They have Free Speech Systems is 89.
[03:12:44.368 --> 03:12:46.089]  We have no website called Free Speech Systems.
[03:12:46.490 --> 03:12:48.151]  And then InfoWars is 109.
[03:12:48.731 --> 03:12:49.973]  I talked to our IT people.
[03:12:50.033 --> 03:12:53.095]  If we combined everything right, we'd be like 54 or something.
[03:12:53.476 --> 03:12:54.056]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:12:54.536 --> 03:12:55.818]  Free Speech Systems is 81.
[03:12:56.959 --> 03:12:58.120]  We don't have a website called that.
[03:12:58.140 --> 03:12:59.741]  In some way, it's listed or something.
[03:13:00.121 --> 03:13:01.923]  So that's how they keep us from being even listed.
[03:13:01.943 --> 03:13:04.265]  They just name our company so no one can actually see it.
[03:13:05.619 --> 03:13:07.901]  Even still, Alex, we were up like 10 places.
[03:13:07.941 --> 03:13:12.325]  But I mean, look at the article we had out Sunday about the riots in Milwaukee.
[03:13:12.725 --> 03:13:16.469]  Last time I checked, 17,000 comments.
[03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:18.811]  That's totally crazy.
[03:13:18.851 --> 03:13:21.633]  That must have been one of the top articles on the web for that day.
[03:13:22.194 --> 03:13:23.355]  We're reaching more and more people.
[03:13:23.375 --> 03:13:26.778]  The point is, we're growing, they're imploding, and so they want to censor now.
[03:13:29.738 --> 03:13:35.482]  Yeah, and it's like, oh, you're so discredited, no one's listening to you, we don't even... I mean, that's kind of a protection in a way.
[03:13:35.502 --> 03:13:40.825]  Paul, I have seen thousands of articles, not to obsess on Drudge, but that's what everybody obsesses on, so we have to.
[03:13:42.266 --> 03:13:48.771]  I've seen thousands of articles saying Drudge is gone, Drudge is down, Drudge is a joke, Drudge has failed, Drudge doesn't matter anymore.
[03:13:49.211 --> 03:13:50.092]  All horseman-er.
[03:13:50.432 --> 03:13:56.156]  It shows this ghost stance the mainstream media is doing, and Drudge is just indicative of the rest of the new media.
[03:13:57.912 --> 03:13:59.534]  No, I mean, that's precisely it.
[03:13:59.554 --> 03:14:01.876]  There's this narrative that they put out over and over again.
[03:14:02.396 --> 03:14:03.557]  Drudge is irrelevant.
[03:14:03.717 --> 03:14:05.599]  Infowars is so discredited.
[03:14:05.980 --> 03:14:11.605]  These are the same people who have got 6% trust amongst Americans right now.
[03:14:11.625 --> 03:14:14.648]  6% trust in the mainstream media.
[03:14:15.008 --> 03:14:16.269]  All-time record lows.
[03:14:16.610 --> 03:14:20.934]  And they think that they have the prerogative, that they have the credibility
[03:14:21.454 --> 03:14:24.519]  To stand up there and lecture everybody else about who they should listen to.
[03:14:24.539 --> 03:14:34.293]  Sure, and I've said for two decades they're using giant immigrant groups to come in, to forge them into political groups, to bring in global governance, and now George Soros is hacked, and it says exactly that!
[03:14:34.633 --> 03:14:37.558]  Exactly what we said, word for word!
[03:14:39.226 --> 03:14:41.807]  I mean, you can look at the Black Lives Matter funding.
[03:14:41.867 --> 03:14:43.307]  Again, I tweeted this out earlier.
[03:14:43.327 --> 03:14:44.567]  I'll talk about it later.
[03:14:44.987 --> 03:14:51.369]  But in just one of those leaked documents, it talks about $600,000 to one particular Black Lives Matter group.
[03:14:51.689 --> 03:14:53.589]  We know that it's in the hundreds of millions.
[03:14:54.049 --> 03:14:59.010]  The media up until all along basically said, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:14:59.070 --> 03:15:01.091]  George Soros isn't funding Black Lives Matter.
[03:15:01.451 --> 03:15:02.631]  It's there in the documents.
[03:15:02.771 --> 03:15:07.952]  I had Media Matters five years ago call me and they said, an investigative journalist from Media Matters wished to interview you.
[03:15:08.432 --> 03:15:09.992]  I wasn't even doing interviews then, you know.
[03:15:10.252 --> 03:15:16.433]  Now, I mean, I had like the Leningradian, New York Times, a bunch of other big publications call and go, we want big profiles, aren't you honored?
[03:15:16.453 --> 03:15:17.854]  And I said, no, no profile.
[03:15:18.174 --> 03:15:19.114]  Make up whatever crap you want.
[03:15:19.134 --> 03:15:19.914]  That's my answer to them.
[03:15:20.274 --> 03:15:22.054]  But I did it just so I could snicker.
[03:15:22.474 --> 03:15:27.115]  They had the guy under David Brock on the phone for an hour going, we don't know who George Soros is.
[03:15:27.175 --> 03:15:27.835]  We don't get funding.
[03:15:28.055 --> 03:15:29.896]  So I was pulling up Federal Elections Commission stuff.
[03:15:30.176 --> 03:15:31.276]  You got three million this year and he goes,
[03:15:33.978 --> 03:15:39.564]  I mean, they literally think I'm one of their retarded, fake, liberal readers that can't wipe their ass.
[03:15:40.625 --> 03:15:46.550]  I mean, you people are illiberal, fascist, satanic pieces of filth.
[03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:48.692]  I mean, do you understand, scumbags?
[03:15:48.772 --> 03:15:49.833]  We know who you are.
[03:15:49.853 --> 03:15:50.374]  Go ahead, Paul.
[03:15:51.857 --> 03:15:53.737]  No, and it's the same with the Daily Beast.
[03:15:53.777 --> 03:15:57.478]  They came out with a big hit piece against us last week.
[03:15:57.538 --> 03:16:05.340]  Again, owned by a company whose board of directors includes Chelsea Clinton, vice-chair of the Clinton Foundation.
[03:16:05.640 --> 03:16:07.080]  They're owned by the Clintons.
[03:16:07.120 --> 03:16:08.481]  They're a Clinton mouthpiece.
[03:16:08.921 --> 03:16:09.681]  They attack us.
[03:16:09.721 --> 03:16:11.181]  They think they're going to discredit us.
[03:16:11.641 --> 03:16:19.783]  They're so discredited, Alex, at the Daily Beast, they had to remove the comment section from their website entirely, because every single article
[03:16:20.123 --> 03:16:21.524]  They were just getting absolutely trammed.
[03:16:21.544 --> 03:16:24.425]  And by the way, studies show that's what's popular, not the article.
[03:16:25.665 --> 03:16:26.066]  Exactly.
[03:16:26.086 --> 03:16:34.709]  They've had studies which show people believe the narrative, the, you know, perspective of the article, not from the actual content, but from the comments below it.
[03:16:35.149 --> 03:16:39.051]  So that's why the mainstream media is panicking and having to remove them altogether.
[03:16:39.371 --> 03:16:40.172]  So they're sacrificing the press.
[03:16:40.192 --> 03:16:42.933]  Listen, Webster Hubbell's daughter may own you, but it doesn't matter.
[03:16:44.511 --> 03:16:46.993]  Exactly, and I mean, I've got another example of that.
[03:16:47.013 --> 03:16:47.873]  He's a very handsome man.
[03:16:49.074 --> 03:16:50.155]  So is Chelsea.
[03:16:52.336 --> 03:16:52.977]  Well, exactly.
[03:16:52.997 --> 03:16:58.140]  The concern is now, Alex, obviously they're just going to undercut that entirely.
[03:16:58.160 --> 03:17:00.262]  They're going to forget about censorship on the web.
[03:17:00.282 --> 03:17:01.723]  They're just going to come and arrest us.
[03:17:02.263 --> 03:17:10.089]  I mean, London's new mayor, who, you know, stood on a platform with an ISIS supporter on nine separate occasions, he's now in control of everything.
[03:17:10.169 --> 03:17:11.650]  And he says he's not after you, Paul.
[03:17:12.554 --> 03:17:14.936]  Yeah, he's announced this hate crime initiative.
[03:17:14.976 --> 03:17:18.159]  He's going to go after people who post offensive... Look at the little power-tripping bastard.
[03:17:18.179 --> 03:17:19.620]  Oh, I'm so sick of these people.
[03:17:20.201 --> 03:17:22.863]  God, why are... I guess we deserve to be ruled by these people.
[03:17:23.063 --> 03:17:30.490]  I just... Well, I mean, the lesson is, Alex, don't let everything be segregated into those internet ghettos.
[03:17:30.570 --> 03:17:37.737]  As Drudge said, they can censor us on Facebook and Twitter, even though, you know... The lesson is, don't let that mayor come at your daughter's genitals with loppers.
[03:17:39.909 --> 03:17:47.452]  But I mean, you know, I got literally three dozen death threats just over the past 24 hours from Black Lives Matter.
[03:17:48.092 --> 03:17:50.253]  Facebook does absolutely nothing about that.
[03:17:50.313 --> 03:17:51.413]  I've reported them before.
[03:17:51.773 --> 03:17:53.174]  No consequences whatsoever.
[03:17:56.175 --> 03:17:58.056]  That's progressive, as Sally Cohn says.
[03:17:58.436 --> 03:17:59.577]  Sharia law is progressive.
[03:18:00.237 --> 03:18:01.458]  That has no consequence.
[03:18:01.758 --> 03:18:07.422]  But post the word tranny on Facebook, you'll get suspended for 30 days because that's what's important.
[03:18:07.862 --> 03:18:11.904]  Banning the word tranny, not following up on actual death threats.
[03:18:12.305 --> 03:18:15.767]  And they lecture us about cyberbullying when that's what they're focused on.
[03:18:16.451 --> 03:18:18.634]  Alright, well we got a bunch of calls here if you have time to get to them.
[03:18:18.654 --> 03:18:20.737]  If you don't understand they're great callers, they'll understand.
[03:18:21.057 --> 03:18:26.844]  I'm going to give all these callers who are holding patiently a free Hillary for President shirt, limited edition, at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:18:26.864 --> 03:18:30.049]  We're going to go through and get all their addresses and make sure we get them guys.
[03:18:30.129 --> 03:18:33.072]  I want to send them all a free Hillary for President shirt.
[03:18:34.155 --> 03:18:35.716]  I want to thank folks for all their support.
[03:18:35.936 --> 03:18:40.337]  We built something original here, something real, something brazen, something unapologetic.
[03:18:40.878 --> 03:18:51.302]  And when you buy Hillary for President shirt or a Bill Clinton rape shirt or 20% off on the great nutraceuticals out there like Living Defense that we've got right now, it funds this operation.
[03:18:51.322 --> 03:18:56.644]  So Paul, in closing, did you ever think the info war when I hired you 15 years ago would be this effective?
[03:18:56.664 --> 03:18:58.665]  Because I'm not bragging about how effective we are.
[03:18:59.005 --> 03:19:00.626]  It's just it's an example of success.
[03:19:00.686 --> 03:19:01.566]  It's a success story.
[03:19:03.496 --> 03:19:14.441]  Well, I mean, it's taken hard work, it's taken a lot of commitment, it's taken people supporting us and buying, you know, back in the day your VHS tapes in 1999 or whatever.
[03:19:14.782 --> 03:19:16.802]  That was the foundation of what it is today.
[03:19:16.843 --> 03:19:27.828]  You know, it's gone from what a handful of people to so many employees now just on a business level and we're reaching infinitely more people than ever before and that's why the establishment's terrifying.
[03:19:28.905 --> 03:19:32.908]  Yeah, I gotta tell you, what do you make of the Secret Service leaks?
[03:19:32.988 --> 03:19:35.309]  Because those are Secret Service leaks we got.
[03:19:35.349 --> 03:19:36.210]  We took the risk to do it.
[03:19:36.230 --> 03:19:38.812]  I had a really scary feeling doing it, but I knew I had to do it.
[03:19:39.452 --> 03:19:43.575]  And then now, about how sick Hillary is, and then two days later,
[03:19:44.619 --> 03:19:46.520]  Three days later, no coverage.
[03:19:47.340 --> 03:19:53.123]  Because they, I mean, they'll cover what we do if a banana peel falls on the ground, or, you know, if a leaf falls on my head, it's national news.
[03:19:54.003 --> 03:19:54.784]  No coverage.
[03:19:55.124 --> 03:19:58.865]  I mean, if I'm discredited, say that I made up the Secret Service leak.
[03:19:59.426 --> 03:20:00.366]  You know, I'm a big fan.
[03:20:00.406 --> 03:20:01.707]  They will not touch it, Paul.
[03:20:02.127 --> 03:20:02.967]  What does that tell you?
[03:20:04.308 --> 03:20:10.751]  It tells you that they're paranoid about the truth about Hillary's health coming out, which it will, in dribs and drabs, and she's going to start collapsing more.
[03:20:10.771 --> 03:20:11.891]  We're going to see more of that.
[03:20:12.051 --> 03:20:13.212]  So they can't hide it anymore.
[03:20:14.141 --> 03:20:16.023]  Well, look, you look at her, she looks hell.
[03:20:16.043 --> 03:20:17.424]  I mean, she looks drugged up.
[03:20:17.484 --> 03:20:19.346]  She looks really bad compared to even a month ago.
[03:20:21.108 --> 03:20:22.309]  They think it's Parkinson's.
[03:20:22.349 --> 03:20:22.910]  They don't know.
[03:20:22.970 --> 03:20:24.492]  They just know she's falling down all the time.
[03:20:24.972 --> 03:20:25.833]  And flopping around.
[03:20:25.873 --> 03:20:26.634]  What do you think it is, Paul?
[03:20:28.823 --> 03:20:35.407]  Honestly, I'm not a medical person, but all the people I speak to, and since I put that video out, more have flooded in.
[03:20:35.847 --> 03:20:45.212]  You know, the Daily Beast was like, oh, the only person he cited was Martin Shkreli, this discredited pharmaceutical oligarch or whatever.
[03:20:45.653 --> 03:20:51.456]  Literally in the video were ten different medical experts quoted in the Breitbart article.
[03:20:51.476 --> 03:20:52.597]  They lied, they lied to their viewers.
[03:20:53.277 --> 03:20:59.139]  Secret Service, NYPD officers that have been around Hillary since that video came out.
[03:20:59.219 --> 03:21:03.401]  A bunch of other neurologists, you know, Dr. Ben Carson, others have been on Fox News.
[03:21:03.421 --> 03:21:08.022]  And by the way, it takes energy every time you're around security to scream at them and tell them they're filth and be mean.
[03:21:08.042 --> 03:21:10.403]  I mean, she is a mental patient.
[03:21:11.567 --> 03:21:26.192]  No, if you go back and read the revelations of Secret Service agents, in the White House she would literally walk down the corridor, but demand that everybody get out of the way into the side rooms so that they couldn't look her in the eyes.
[03:21:26.772 --> 03:21:32.754]  That's how demented, and on a power trip, it's literally like something out of the Roman Empire.
[03:21:32.794 --> 03:21:38.916]  I just thought of this, I'm gonna do a funny video where I'm gonna go, I decided I like Hillary, and read the pages and go, that's normal, and I'm walking and I go,
[03:21:38.976 --> 03:21:39.897]  Don't look me in the eye!
[03:21:39.917 --> 03:21:42.319]  And I'm gonna walk down the hall and make everybody hide in offices?
[03:21:42.799 --> 03:21:45.502]  And I'm gonna fall down and convulse and make them cover it up?
[03:21:47.199 --> 03:21:48.519]  No, I mean that's how she behaves.
[03:21:48.819 --> 03:21:50.620]  People have gone on the record so many times.
[03:21:51.260 --> 03:21:56.361]  The other thing that they're worried about is this Seth Rich murder and Sean Lucas and the others.
[03:21:56.801 --> 03:21:59.281]  Extremely little information coming out about that.
[03:21:59.722 --> 03:22:01.802]  But we put a few articles out about it.
[03:22:02.362 --> 03:22:10.944]  After Assange went on TV and basically said that, you know, Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leak, I was contacted privately by this
[03:22:11.624 --> 03:22:20.570]  Veteran Democratic Party strategist who has worked with 120 or so Democrats in their political campaigns in the past.
[03:22:20.610 --> 03:22:23.271]  He's a Bernie Sanders supporter, so he doesn't like Hillary.
[03:22:23.812 --> 03:22:26.713]  And he told me, you're dead on the money with Seth Rich.
[03:22:26.773 --> 03:22:31.236]  He says it's extremely fishy, everybody knows it, that there's a cover-up going on.
[03:22:31.556 --> 03:22:34.018]  So that's not somebody who's wearing a tinfoil hat.
[03:22:34.478 --> 03:22:38.701]  Somebody who's literally on, has major media appearances every week.
[03:22:38.981 --> 03:22:39.921]  He's profiled by...
[03:22:40.762 --> 03:22:42.703]  He basically said this guy was the source.
[03:22:44.044 --> 03:22:47.706]  Yeah, otherwise why would he mention it on that Dutch television show?
[03:22:47.726 --> 03:22:49.867]  Let's go ahead and go to your report.
[03:22:49.887 --> 03:22:51.488]  It's on Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:22:51.508 --> 03:22:53.208]  When you come back, you'll take over, Paul.
[03:22:53.228 --> 03:22:54.809]  But why not play your clip now.
[03:22:54.829 --> 03:22:56.490]  What was it titled?
[03:22:56.510 --> 03:22:57.891]  Hillary's Bizarre Behavior?
[03:22:59.309 --> 03:23:06.271]  It's Hillary's weird behavior, the cover-up, so it's an update on everything that's happened since and all the new revelations that we've got.
[03:23:06.711 --> 03:23:09.092]  And it's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:23:09.252 --> 03:23:17.235]  Everybody out there should send this clip to everybody you know, Facebook, Twitter, everybody, and just say, hey, what do you think's going on with Hillary Clinton?
[03:23:17.255 --> 03:23:17.595]  Here it is.
[03:23:18.604 --> 03:23:29.692]  Since my video went viral and catapulted Hillary's health back into the national spotlight, we've seen more examples of Clinton behaving bizarrely, completely losing her wits mid-sentence.
[03:23:29.812 --> 03:23:47.004]  We need to make what we've got work really well, and improve it, and get the costs out of... a... upward spiral of... a... upward spiral... Nearly falling over again!
[03:23:53.760 --> 03:23:56.203]  Referring to Trump as her husband.
[03:23:56.443 --> 03:24:01.828]  You will compare what I'm proposing to what my opponent is talking about.
[03:24:02.048 --> 03:24:05.432]  Having to be calmed by a mysterious secret service agent.
[03:24:08.772 --> 03:24:13.956]  He also carries around a weird syringe, which some speculate carries an anti-seizure drug.
[03:24:14.016 --> 03:24:19.580]  The re-emergence of photos from February showing Hillary being helped up the stairs by the same guy.
[03:24:19.720 --> 03:24:26.846]  I've also been privately contacted by more medical experts and neurologists who agree that Hillary has major health problems.
[03:24:26.986 --> 03:24:29.768]  More health professionals have also gone on the record.
[03:24:29.928 --> 03:24:34.051]  We have a right to know fully what a neurologist says about this.
[03:24:34.291 --> 03:24:37.794]  If you're going into a very important position like this, it's critical.
[03:24:38.594 --> 03:24:43.397]  And that information should be something that we should have access to.
[03:24:43.437 --> 03:24:53.044]  Secretary Clinton has said history of unexplained falls, a fall leading to post-concussive syndrome, which was documented, and then a cerebral venous thrombosis that was discovered post-fall.
[03:24:53.064 --> 03:24:56.746]  For both candidates, medical history, neurological history has to be transparent.
[03:24:56.786 --> 03:24:58.327]  This is a long and rigorous campaign.
[03:24:58.507 --> 03:25:09.415]  A Secret Service whistleblower also reached out to us privately to reveal how half a million dollars has been spent creating disabled access for three SUVs used by Hillary.
[03:25:09.455 --> 03:25:14.879]  Hillary herself admitted that she short circuits and gets really tired and collapses.
[03:25:14.999 --> 03:25:18.182]  The revelation that she's taking most weekends off.
[03:25:18.462 --> 03:25:23.384]  Oh yeah, and this AP reporter claimed that Hillary's behavior was perfectly normal.
[03:25:23.564 --> 03:25:24.344]  Okay!
[03:25:24.504 --> 03:25:33.328]  But according to Clinton mouthpiece, The Daily Beast, The Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC and others, the whole thing is just a baseless conspiracy.
[03:25:33.548 --> 03:25:35.989]  Total conspiracy theory that literally came from Infowars.
[03:25:36.389 --> 03:25:42.795]  MSNBC's authoritative medical expert, Charlie Pierce, also completely debunked my claims.
[03:25:42.995 --> 03:25:44.837]  This is just nuts, okay?
[03:25:45.237 --> 03:25:46.758]  This is just completely crazy.
[03:25:47.059 --> 03:25:49.180]  Oh wait, he's actually not a medical expert.
[03:25:49.321 --> 03:25:51.122]  He's a game show panelist.
[03:25:51.302 --> 03:25:53.064]  But to be fair, they're right.
[03:25:53.524 --> 03:25:58.889]  I mean, anyone who questions the health of a presidential candidate simply has to be insane.
[03:25:59.169 --> 03:26:02.292]  Is McCain simply too old to get elected?
[03:26:02.532 --> 03:26:10.600]  If it's John McCain's health we're talking about, and he's running for the highest office in the land, his health, with limits, becomes the public business.
[03:26:10.780 --> 03:26:14.964]  How concerned are doctors that this skin cancer may, in fact, return?
[03:26:15.284 --> 03:26:20.048]  Unfortunately for the pro-Hillary prestitutes, their spin isn't working.
[03:26:20.288 --> 03:26:26.234]  According to a Rasmussen poll, 59% of Americans want to see Hillary's health records.
[03:26:27.154 --> 03:26:29.615]  59% say release medical records.
[03:26:29.675 --> 03:26:30.455]  What's wrong with her?
[03:26:30.575 --> 03:26:33.775]  Google searches for Hillary's health are through the roof.
[03:26:34.035 --> 03:26:40.176]  Just as John McCain was pressured into turning over his medical history, Hillary needs to do the same.
[03:26:40.337 --> 03:26:42.817]  We made this into a national conversation.
[03:26:43.097 --> 03:26:45.798]  We forced the establishment media to address it.
[03:26:46.218 --> 03:26:47.938]  Now, they're terrified.
[03:26:48.118 --> 03:26:49.578]  More revelations are coming.
[03:26:50.078 --> 03:26:51.259]  Will the dam break?
[03:26:51.859 --> 03:26:53.759]  Or will the cover-up continue?
[03:26:55.751 --> 03:26:59.033]  That video is entitled Hillary's Weird Behaviour.
[03:26:59.373 --> 03:27:00.114]  The cover up.
[03:27:00.474 --> 03:27:03.236]  And it is up on YouTube as of about two hours ago.
[03:27:03.276 --> 03:27:05.317]  It's also on Infowars.com.
[03:27:05.837 --> 03:27:11.081]  As I said before, the previous video got 2.8 million views on YouTube.
[03:27:11.141 --> 03:27:13.182]  Probably another couple of million on Facebook.
[03:27:13.382 --> 03:27:14.283]  Haven't checked in a while.
[03:27:15.103 --> 03:27:17.545]  But again, it reasserted this scandal.
[03:27:18.005 --> 03:27:20.327]  It brought it back into the national focus.
[03:27:20.908 --> 03:27:29.275]  It forced the likes of CNN, The Washington Post, The Daily Beast and others to try and debunk this by claiming it was all a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory.
[03:27:29.835 --> 03:27:30.135]  Again!
[03:27:30.856 --> 03:27:31.776]  Go back to 2008.
[03:27:32.276 --> 03:27:33.037]  John McCain.
[03:27:33.657 --> 03:27:35.737]  Serious questions over his health.
[03:27:36.257 --> 03:27:39.658]  The mainstream media was absolutely obsessed by it.
[03:27:40.158 --> 03:27:43.239]  They demanded the release of John McCain's medical records.
[03:27:43.899 --> 03:27:45.120]  They pressured him to do so.
[03:27:45.200 --> 03:27:50.461]  He had to do a three-hour private closed-door briefing with reporters
[03:27:51.201 --> 03:27:56.325]  To lay out, I think it was 1,500 documents relating to his health.
[03:27:56.946 --> 03:27:59.788]  Again, he had to go through absolute full disclosure.
[03:27:59.808 --> 03:28:02.631]  He was 71 years old at the time.
[03:28:03.051 --> 03:28:04.432]  Hillary Clinton is currently 69.
[03:28:05.653 --> 03:28:07.034]  I believe she's approaching 70.
[03:28:08.055 --> 03:28:13.596]  And again, all these major signs of health problems, all these neurologists, health experts going on the record.
[03:28:13.616 --> 03:28:19.998]  Again, Hannity's had several of them on in the past week or so, saying that she's got major health problems.
[03:28:20.378 --> 03:28:28.360]  And we keep seeing signs of it again just yesterday, falling over during the speech with Joe Beden again.
[03:28:29.568 --> 03:28:31.611]  Calling Trump her husband.
[03:28:32.252 --> 03:28:40.264]  Now we've got a website which is offering $1 million in return for a whistleblower to leak Hillary Clinton's medical records.
[03:28:41.420 --> 03:28:47.161]  It claims that it's assembled a group of individual donors who are willing to put up the money to encourage the release of the records.
[03:28:47.301 --> 03:28:50.182]  Quote, a million dollars can buy you safety.
[03:28:50.342 --> 03:28:52.522]  It gives a would-be whistleblower some ease.
[03:28:52.962 --> 03:28:55.923]  The Philadelphia-based website said.
[03:28:55.963 --> 03:29:00.244]  You can go and link through to their statements from our article at Infowars.com.
[03:29:00.884 --> 03:29:04.905]  But again, the media, the mainstream media, just keeps claiming over and over again.
[03:29:05.683 --> 03:29:10.989]  Oh, Hillary's personal physician said a year ago that she was perfectly fine.
[03:29:11.009 --> 03:29:16.915]  Well, of course, A, why do you automatically trust Hillary's personal physician?
[03:29:17.215 --> 03:29:20.378]  Why, that's an independent, unimpeachable source.
[03:29:21.332 --> 03:29:23.593]  Absolute nonsense, and it was a year ago.
[03:29:23.613 --> 03:29:26.315]  Hillary Clinton is getting old.
[03:29:26.755 --> 03:29:30.737]  Your health at that age can change a lot over the course of a year.
[03:29:31.377 --> 03:29:33.298]  So again, huge questions about this.
[03:29:33.678 --> 03:29:37.360]  We've driven it, with your help, back into a national debate.
[03:29:37.741 --> 03:29:39.441]  So has the Drudge Report.
[03:29:39.742 --> 03:29:41.863]  So have people like Mike Cernovich and others.
[03:29:42.543 --> 03:29:44.544]  This is a massive issue going forward.
[03:29:44.924 --> 03:29:52.168]  Will Hillary Clinton release her medical records just like the mainstream media forced John McCain to release his back in 2008?
[03:29:52.448 --> 03:29:55.870]  Or will they continue to be part of the cover-up?
[03:29:55.890 --> 03:29:58.691]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live in a minute.
[03:29:58.751 --> 03:29:59.172]  Stay tuned.
[03:29:59.192 --> 03:29:59.992]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.492 --> 03:30:02.113]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.033 --> 03:30:05.715]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.373 --> 03:30:12.294]  Article from the Associated Press.
[03:30:12.554 --> 03:30:20.797]  A Chicago-based communist revolutionary group was blamed by Milwaukee's police chief for stoking a second day of violence.
[03:30:21.257 --> 03:30:30.160]  Police Chief Ed Flynn said members of a Chicago chapter of the revolutionary communist party turned what had been a peaceful night into a tense one.
[03:30:30.620 --> 03:30:35.023]  TV footage showed a small group of protesters walking or running through the streets.
[03:30:35.263 --> 03:30:49.332]  The fatal police shooting of a 23-year-old black man, Savelle Smith, touched off a weekend of tense and at times violent protests that left at least six businesses burned and several officers injured by flying objects Saturday night.
[03:30:49.532 --> 03:30:55.476]  Fourteen people were arrested overnight, and three police officers and four sheriff's deputies were injured.
[03:30:56.101 --> 03:30:58.546]  InfoWars has its team on the ground.
[03:30:58.886 --> 03:31:03.555]  News Director Rob Due has already filmed communist recruitment signage.
[03:31:03.895 --> 03:31:07.462]  Go to InfoWars.com for breaking news on Milwaukee.
[03:31:10.157 --> 03:31:16.319]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:31:16.700 --> 03:31:19.581]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[03:31:19.921 --> 03:31:25.123]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[03:31:25.543 --> 03:31:31.505]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:31:31.645 --> 03:31:34.786]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:31:34.926 --> 03:31:36.387]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[03:31:36.587 --> 03:31:40.731]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:31:40.931 --> 03:31:43.794]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:31:43.874 --> 03:31:45.435]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:31:45.535 --> 03:31:48.718]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:31:48.998 --> 03:31:51.321]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:31:51.601 --> 03:31:52.582]  It's in powder form.
[03:31:52.662 --> 03:31:55.364]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:31:55.544 --> 03:31:56.145]  I take this.
[03:31:56.265 --> 03:31:57.947]  This is the product that I take.
[03:31:58.067 --> 03:32:00.028]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[03:32:00.849 --> 03:32:01.630]  We fight the Globals!
[03:32:01.650 --> 03:32:02.510]  We fight the New World Order!

[03:32:10.195 --> 03:32:11.576]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:32:11.856 --> 03:32:13.137]  You can't survive without it.
[03:32:13.337 --> 03:32:14.237]  But where do you get it?
[03:32:14.538 --> 03:32:20.301]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:32:20.521 --> 03:32:26.245]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:32:26.425 --> 03:32:43.304]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:32:43.684 --> 03:32:45.805]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:32:46.165 --> 03:32:47.366]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:32:47.646 --> 03:32:48.406]  Easy assembly.
[03:32:48.686 --> 03:32:49.306]  Low maintenance.
[03:32:49.587 --> 03:32:51.407]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:33:04.173 --> 03:33:06.734]  Go to InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:22.215 --> 03:33:29.919]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:33.513 --> 03:33:37.438]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show, fourth hour of the drive.
[03:33:37.778 --> 03:33:45.669]  Before we get back into the news, I want to remind you to go to infowarslife.com, where we have got Living Defense 20% off for a limited time only.
[03:33:45.809 --> 03:33:45.909]  Again.
[03:33:50.114 --> 03:34:01.342]  This is what pays for us to send the reporters out, as you saw earlier with Rob Dew and the crew, to places like Milwaukee, where we can challenge the mainstream media narrative directly.
[03:34:02.002 --> 03:34:05.625]  I mean, they hightailed it out of there and you probably couldn't blame them.
[03:34:06.105 --> 03:34:12.910]  After the peaceful Black Lives Matter supporters started beating up reporters, we sent ours back in.
[03:34:13.885 --> 03:34:17.648]  And believe me, some of these situations are not safe situations to be in.
[03:34:18.209 --> 03:34:20.390]  That's why we value your support.
[03:34:20.791 --> 03:34:24.614]  The plane tickets, the hotel bills, the equipment, it's all worth it.
[03:34:24.954 --> 03:34:35.663]  Because we're really supplanting the mainstream media, which has 6% trust from the American people, because of burgeoning alternative media outlets like Infowars.com.
[03:34:36.624 --> 03:34:41.571]  That, as Alex said earlier, has been allowed to grow only through your continued support.
[03:34:41.631 --> 03:34:50.403]  So we got Living Defense, the Harmful Organism Cleanser, now 20% off at infowarslife.com after being sold out for months!
[03:34:51.380 --> 03:34:55.524]  Now is the time to secure your bottle for this discounted price before we completely run out again.
[03:34:56.104 --> 03:35:02.110]  Start eliminating toxic and harmful organisms from your body naturally without harmful chemicals.
[03:35:02.570 --> 03:35:17.343]  Again, that's Living Defense 20% off massive discount at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsStore.com where you can get the Hillary for Prison t-shirts, Brain Force and all the other great products, which again,
[03:35:18.024 --> 03:35:29.076]  Gives us fire in our bellies, allows us to actually go out there and fight this InfoWar, get in the face of the mainstream media, supplant their useless, biased reporting.
[03:35:29.237 --> 03:35:34.903]  It's all made possible from you getting the products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:35:34.923 --> 03:35:37.986]  So please go there and support InfoWars today.
[03:35:39.161 --> 03:35:41.182]  Now let's get back into the news here.
[03:35:41.222 --> 03:35:43.364]  Obviously we were talking about Hillary's health earlier.
[03:35:43.384 --> 03:35:44.825]  That's a continuing issue.
[03:35:44.865 --> 03:35:47.186]  We'll continue to have more revelations about that.
[03:35:47.246 --> 03:35:53.951]  As I said, almost every day I'm contacted by people, neurologists, health experts.
[03:35:53.991 --> 03:35:58.354]  These aren't internet conspiracy theorists as the Daily Beast would have it or CNN.
[03:35:58.974 --> 03:36:00.295]  These are health professionals.
[03:36:00.335 --> 03:36:01.296]  These are experts.
[03:36:01.396 --> 03:36:05.819]  More and more now going on the record saying that Hillary Clinton has major problems.
[03:36:06.559 --> 03:36:14.087]  Those problems are going to come to light as the intensification of the stress continues in this build-up to November, of course.
[03:36:14.127 --> 03:36:20.714]  She's going to be debating, unless she tries to get out of that, with Trump at some point, so that could be a major flashpoint.
[03:36:20.974 --> 03:36:25.518]  We had the article yesterday, exhausted Hillary Clinton taking long weekends off.
[03:36:26.159 --> 03:36:29.482]  Again, they looked at the record, she was having most weekends off.
[03:36:30.350 --> 03:36:37.621]  Even in the heat of this dogfight with Donald Trump, she's taking more and more time off before she even gets into office.
[03:36:38.162 --> 03:36:42.768]  She's probably going to outstrip President Obama in terms of doing nothing.
[03:36:43.269 --> 03:36:45.472]  Of course, him being on the golf course half of the time.
[03:36:45.973 --> 03:36:47.134]  But this is a major scandal.
[03:36:47.154 --> 03:36:48.335]  They're trying to cover it up.
[03:36:48.836 --> 03:36:50.077]  Get that new video out.
[03:36:50.117 --> 03:36:51.618]  You made the last one go viral.
[03:36:51.938 --> 03:36:53.460]  Make this one go viral.
[03:36:53.980 --> 03:37:04.250]  And crack this cover up that the mainstream media, the Clinton mouthpiece media, is now engaged in trying to cover up Hillary's health problems.
[03:37:04.290 --> 03:37:05.991]  So that is up on Infowars.com.
[03:37:06.952 --> 03:37:08.993]  We've also got this out of Information Liberation.
[03:37:09.873 --> 03:37:10.793]  Touched on it earlier.
[03:37:10.873 --> 03:37:16.034]  Washington Post reporter sanitizes story of black mob violence gets exposed in comments.
[03:37:16.734 --> 03:37:19.495]  And again, this is about an incident that happened in Montgomery County.
[03:37:19.535 --> 03:37:20.475]  I'm not going to go through it.
[03:37:21.075 --> 03:37:28.217]  But basically what happened, there was a disturbance where somebody got beaten up by a huge mob of young men.
[03:37:29.317 --> 03:37:33.038]  They quoted the victim, I believe it was, in the comments.
[03:37:33.758 --> 03:37:35.399]  Or somebody who at least witnessed it.
[03:37:36.420 --> 03:37:37.901]  And he called them out in the comments.
[03:37:37.941 --> 03:37:52.614]  He actually went into the comments and called out the Washington Post reporter because they didn't mention the little fact that this mob of young men chasing and assaulting another African-American man were all African-American.
[03:37:53.134 --> 03:38:00.360]  He pointed it out in the comments and again it totally dissolved the article because they leave out these crucial aspects.
[03:38:00.400 --> 03:38:02.042]  He saw it with the knockout game.
[03:38:03.007 --> 03:38:07.832]  Again, a media-contrived hoax to hide the fact that it was black-on-white violence.
[03:38:08.432 --> 03:38:10.254]  We see this over and over again.
[03:38:11.235 --> 03:38:24.008]  They've done studies which show readers look at a news article, they scan through the article, and they decide on whether they believe the content of the article based on what the comments say.
[03:38:25.106 --> 03:38:38.175]  Studies have been done that prove that, which is why over the past three years you've seen big mainstream media websites remove their comment sections altogether, because they then be challenged on their bias.
[03:38:39.451 --> 03:38:42.373]  Again, they're spewing absolute BS in the article.
[03:38:42.413 --> 03:38:43.874]  They don't want to be called out on it.
[03:38:44.515 --> 03:38:58.745]  So instead of having to employ people as all these newspapers collapse, because they're completely discredited and no one reads them, instead of actually having to pay to employ moderators to weed out these comments, they simply remove the comment sections altogether.
[03:38:59.726 --> 03:39:08.373]  You see it in other news outlets like the Guardian where they say, oh, we're just not going to have comments on certain articles about race or about immigration.
[03:39:09.178 --> 03:39:18.049]  And then in other cases like the Daily Beast, they simply remove them altogether because they've only got 6% trust of the public.
[03:39:18.369 --> 03:39:23.936]  They're completely discredited and they don't want to be challenged on their phony narrative.
[03:39:24.437 --> 03:39:26.219]  So you saw another example of it there.
[03:39:26.900 --> 03:39:32.848]  And again yesterday, in terms of Milwaukee, we saw yet another example, and this is Mark Dice who picked up on this.
[03:39:32.948 --> 03:39:34.670]  We reported on it as well.
[03:39:35.311 --> 03:39:42.940]  Where you had the sister of the man shot dead, again the gang member armed thug who pointed a gun at cops, Black Lives Matter icon.
[03:39:43.701 --> 03:39:53.645]  Shot dead, and of course the sister went on TV, spoke to reporters out on the street, basically said, this is ridiculous how we're burning down our own neighbourhoods.
[03:39:53.725 --> 03:39:58.327]  Go into the suburbs, go into the white areas and burn down their neighbourhoods.
[03:39:59.047 --> 03:40:04.870]  Well, CNN didn't quite give us the full story on that, and here's Mark Dice to break it down.
[03:40:06.408 --> 03:40:18.173]  Have a look at this clip of the family of the dead thug in Milwaukee that sparked rioting Saturday night, calling for black people to burn down the homes and businesses of white people.
[03:40:18.693 --> 03:40:22.035]  There's going to be some foul language here, so just a heads up.
[03:40:22.315 --> 03:40:31.419]  Then I'll show you a clip of what CNN reported, claiming that she's calling for peace, when it's exactly the opposite.
[03:40:31.839 --> 03:40:35.781]  This woman should be arrested for inciting a riot.
[03:40:36.321 --> 03:40:37.402]  Listen to this.
[03:40:37.422 --> 03:40:40.425]  Take that bleep to the suburbs.
[03:40:40.485 --> 03:40:41.406]  Burn that bleep down.
[03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:16.958]  We need our weaves, is what she's saying, because the black community always goes and loots a hair extension store, stealing weaves every time a dead thug is put down by a police officer.
[03:41:18.599 --> 03:41:21.701]  Have a listen to what CNN reported.
[03:41:22.081 --> 03:41:30.747]  Oh, here's their website, actually, where it says, No, you just heard it.
[03:41:31.148 --> 03:41:32.949]  She said, Take it to the suburbs.
[03:41:33.329 --> 03:41:35.731]  Take it to where the white people live.
[03:41:36.291 --> 03:41:43.136]  Here's what CNN reported on air, only showing half of what she said to the crowd.
[03:41:44.344 --> 03:41:47.466]  Smith's family and friends holding a vigil marked by prayers.
[03:41:47.946 --> 03:41:50.507]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done!
[03:41:50.787 --> 03:41:52.628]  With his sister calling for peace.
[03:41:53.189 --> 03:41:55.550]  Don't bring the violence here and the ignorance here!
[03:41:57.191 --> 03:41:58.291]  Oh, don't bring it here!
[03:41:58.571 --> 03:42:01.493]  And then they cut the clip immediately.
[03:42:02.153 --> 03:42:13.079]  Let's have a listen one more time to her encouraging this angry mob to invade the white communities in the suburbs and bring the violence there.
[03:42:16.616 --> 03:42:23.100]  Show his mama you're sorry for her loss by burning down white people's homes and businesses.
[03:42:37.188 --> 03:42:39.649]  We need our weaves.
[03:42:40.509 --> 03:42:42.170]  Absolutely despicable.
[03:42:42.830 --> 03:42:58.116]  This demonic creature who appears as a human female should be in prison for inciting a riot and held accountable and have to pay restitution for the damages to the Milwaukee community.
[03:42:59.139 --> 03:43:01.381]  Okay, there's Mark Dice breaking it down again.
[03:43:02.121 --> 03:43:12.828]  This sister of this killed individual, you know, getting shot dead by cops in Milwaukee, she came out and said, don't burn down your own neighbourhoods, burn down those white neighbourhoods in the suburbs.
[03:43:13.468 --> 03:43:18.472]  CNN cut the last part out and said, oh, she's calling for peace!
[03:43:19.252 --> 03:43:24.754]  When she's actually calling for people to burn down suburbs in which white people live.
[03:43:25.334 --> 03:43:31.576]  They all moved out of central Milwaukee, they all moved out into the suburbs as I documented in our article on this yesterday.
[03:43:32.236 --> 03:43:43.500]  So again, yet another example of blatant media censorship to hide the truth that Black Lives Matter is a violent, racist, domestic hate group.
[03:43:44.434 --> 03:43:53.897]  And people say, oh, how can you, how dare you take the words of one individual or a few idiots, a few looters, a few rioters, and blame the entirety of Black Lives Matter for that?
[03:43:54.497 --> 03:44:05.740]  Well, the very founders of Black Lives Matter say that their ideological guru, the inspiration behind the whole movement, is Assata Shakur.
[03:44:06.260 --> 03:44:13.442]  Assata Shakur is a domestic terrorist on the FBI's top 10 most wanted terrorists list,
[03:44:14.295 --> 03:44:18.460]  Who was convicted for killing a police officer, okay?
[03:44:18.500 --> 03:44:23.085]  That's who the founders of Black Lives Matter cite as their inspiration.
[03:44:23.445 --> 03:44:31.975]  So don't tell me that this group isn't violent, when that's the person whose name they chant at every single protest.
[03:44:32.915 --> 03:44:45.017]  And again, we had in Milwaukee, shooting, looting, burning, launching violent racist hate crime attacks, as we saw, calling for people to hunt down whites.
[03:44:45.557 --> 03:44:47.378]  Literally, oh look, they're white, get them!
[03:44:48.558 --> 03:44:54.739]  Violent, racially charged hate crimes, looting, burning, shooting.
[03:44:55.479 --> 03:45:00.260]  A white guy, who was a supporter of Black Lives Matter, got shot in the neck.
[03:45:01.803 --> 03:45:03.407]  These people are violent.
[03:45:04.229 --> 03:45:08.560]  And yet what did the mainstream media keep calling them after all this carnage?
[03:45:09.673 --> 03:45:10.614]  Demonstrators.
[03:45:11.234 --> 03:45:12.035]  Protestors.
[03:45:12.595 --> 03:45:32.090]  Can you imagine if a bunch of right-wing rednecks who cited, you know, the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, as their inspiration, were out in mobs, hunting down and beating black people, shooting people in the neck, burning down buildings, looting stores.
[03:45:32.710 --> 03:45:35.012]  Would the media call them demonstrators?
[03:45:35.572 --> 03:45:35.752]  No.
[03:45:36.533 --> 03:45:41.940]  Because they've lied from the very beginning about this entire Black Lives Matter narrative.
[03:45:42.861 --> 03:45:50.852]  And this is how the Business Insider, prominent digital journalist, pulls out of Milwaukee for those who are perceivably why it's not safe to be here.
[03:45:51.741 --> 03:46:01.047]  Well-known journalist who frequently covers civil unrest across the country has decided to leave Milwaukee because of racial tensions he observed while covering protests on Sunday night.
[03:46:01.067 --> 03:46:11.634]  And again, this is Tim Pool and you can go and watch his video where he says, look, they were very, very clear that they were going to physically attack white people, didn't want them to be there.
[03:46:12.494 --> 03:46:15.176]  And after this, you know, a guy got shot in the neck.
[03:46:15.756 --> 03:46:19.879]  They were literally hunting down white people and trying to drag them out of their vehicles.
[03:46:21.107 --> 03:46:26.791]  So people, reporters, they're being beat up, they're being run out of there, they're saying we gotta leave, this is just too dangerous.
[03:46:28.212 --> 03:46:33.255]  Now I posted an image of the guy who was shot dead by cops in Milwaukee.
[03:46:34.594 --> 03:46:38.836]  On Sunday, I believe, on my Facebook page, and said, oh look, another armed thug.
[03:46:39.376 --> 03:46:41.596]  Black Lives Matter's latest icon.
[03:46:42.177 --> 03:46:45.698]  Well, lo and behold, I checked my Facebook messages last night.
[03:46:46.178 --> 03:46:50.720]  Literally two dozen, if not three dozen, death threats.
[03:46:51.500 --> 03:46:56.862]  Dozens more racist abuse from Black Lives Matter supporters.
[03:46:57.322 --> 03:46:59.343]  And in fact, I put it up on Twitter.
[03:47:00.270 --> 03:47:03.974]  Violent threats I received from Black Lives Matter supporters over the last 24 hours.
[03:47:04.074 --> 03:47:07.979]  And again, I don't do this because I'm sat here trembling that they're gonna come and get me.
[03:47:08.039 --> 03:47:08.780]  I don't care!
[03:47:10.101 --> 03:47:11.262]  Most of them are barely...
[03:47:12.563 --> 03:47:14.805]  Intelligent enough to string together a sentence.
[03:47:15.445 --> 03:47:16.306]  I really don't care.
[03:47:16.466 --> 03:47:18.247]  I'm not posting it for that reason.
[03:47:18.288 --> 03:47:26.214]  I'm posting it because the media, because Sally Cohn, because CNN, over and over again, says that this is a peaceful group.
[03:47:26.554 --> 03:47:27.895]  It's not a peaceful group.
[03:47:28.235 --> 03:47:29.216]  It's foundation.
[03:47:29.496 --> 03:47:30.237]  It's behavior.
[03:47:30.497 --> 03:47:31.418]  It's activities.
[03:47:32.975 --> 03:47:35.697]  It's rhetoric is not peaceful, it's violent.
[03:47:35.757 --> 03:47:39.200]  And in fact, you know, I just posted a sampling of the death threats.
[03:47:39.240 --> 03:47:40.782]  I mean, I couldn't go through them all.
[03:47:41.282 --> 03:47:42.223]  But here's a sample.
[03:47:43.564 --> 03:47:47.367]  Again, received within the space of 24 hours from Black Lives Matter supporters.
[03:47:48.148 --> 03:47:52.371]  I will find you and kill you, you effing faggot.
[03:47:54.233 --> 03:47:56.114]  When I find you, I will kill you.
[03:47:56.995 --> 03:47:57.556]  Here's another one.
[03:47:57.696 --> 03:47:59.998]  You and Donald Trump is next to die.
[03:48:01.209 --> 03:48:04.070]  Don't think because you live in London you can't be found.
[03:48:04.591 --> 03:48:08.132]  Again, these are all just received over the last 24 hours on Facebook.
[03:48:08.853 --> 03:48:11.034]  We will find you and we will kill you.
[03:48:11.674 --> 03:48:13.635]  Not beating around the bush here.
[03:48:15.036 --> 03:48:18.577]  Bitch, I hope somebody kill yo white bleep.
[03:48:19.658 --> 03:48:22.559]  Again, I can't even read most of them because they're so profane.
[03:48:23.199 --> 03:48:23.940]  I'mma kill you.
[03:48:25.185 --> 03:48:28.306]  You bitch-ass sucker, they gon' kill you when they find you.
[03:48:28.867 --> 03:48:30.227]  Don't come to Milwaukee.
[03:48:30.407 --> 03:48:42.533]  Again, this is all because I posted a picture of the guy shot dead by cops, where you see him holding the gun, with the links to the documentation where he's an actual gang member.
[03:48:43.053 --> 03:48:44.534]  And again, this was the response.
[03:48:44.714 --> 03:48:47.335]  Dozens and dozens of violent threats.
[03:48:48.175 --> 03:48:49.536]  Racist abuse.
[03:48:49.756 --> 03:48:51.177]  Again, I don't care.
[03:48:52.173 --> 03:48:57.280]  I hold this up as an example of the fact that this is a violent, racist group.
[03:48:57.420 --> 03:49:00.104]  These are the kind of people who support it.
[03:49:00.868 --> 03:49:03.229]  Yet CNN will never tell you about that.
[03:49:03.249 --> 03:49:14.971]  And they'll continue to call people who are shooting guns, burning down neighborhoods, you know, hunting white people in packs, they'll continue to call them demonstrators.
[03:49:15.691 --> 03:49:18.752]  That's how the media props up Black Lives Matter.
[03:49:19.132 --> 03:49:24.173]  You know, Time Magazine, they had the headline two years ago now, in defense of rioting.
[03:49:25.014 --> 03:49:33.318]  The media, the Obama administration, has given what is a domestic hate group, violent and racist, legitimacy.
[03:49:33.818 --> 03:49:36.800]  And that's why these riots continue to be a problem.
[03:49:37.160 --> 03:49:48.966]  In fact, we had the story about the alderman there in Milwaukee, who again came out after the riots on Sunday night and said, look, there's going to be more riots unless you fix, quote, oppression.
[03:49:50.831 --> 03:49:56.493]  Yeah, I guess looting stores for hair extensions is also to address oppression.
[03:49:56.873 --> 03:49:59.293]  That's a form of fighting injustice.
[03:49:59.713 --> 03:50:05.515]  It's not just criminals taking this opportunity to engage in criminal behaviour.
[03:50:05.715 --> 03:50:07.496]  I'm sure that's not what's going on here.
[03:50:07.916 --> 03:50:13.717]  Again, the alderman came out and said, look, you know, you had the guy on the Facebook video that we posted.
[03:50:14.197 --> 03:50:16.178]  Rich people aren't giving us enough money.
[03:50:16.218 --> 03:50:19.199]  This is going to happen over and over again if you don't give us more money.
[03:50:20.939 --> 03:50:33.765]  Again, this criminal, chic, gangster lifestyle that's been sold to black communities, that's completely, you know, eviscerated their chances of improving themselves, of getting out of the ghetto.
[03:50:34.846 --> 03:50:37.107]  Again, this is what causes this kind of behaviour.
[03:50:38.106 --> 03:50:46.198]  Literally dozens of death threats simply for posting a picture of the guy shot dead by cops in Milwaukee.
[03:50:46.638 --> 03:50:53.989]  And CNN and Sally Cohn still have the nerve to claim that this is a peaceful movement.
[03:50:54.983 --> 03:50:57.765]  Now, speaking of Sally Cohen, we'll be back in the final segment.
[03:50:58.345 --> 03:51:04.389]  She's come out today and said that Muslims who believe in Sharia law are progressives!
[03:51:05.010 --> 03:51:06.651]  We'll get more into that after the break.
[03:51:07.351 --> 03:51:09.233]  Keep it locked in, InfoWars.com.
[03:51:12.697 --> 03:51:15.840]  You said in a speech today you're afraid this election is going to be rigged.
[03:51:16.180 --> 03:51:17.942]  I've been hearing about it for a long time.
[03:51:18.082 --> 03:51:20.885]  I hope the Republicans get out there and watch very closely.
[03:51:20.945 --> 03:51:23.567]  This new poll is showing a big convention bounce for Hillary Clinton.
[03:51:23.667 --> 03:51:27.711]  Following her nomination at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton now leads it.
[03:51:28.011 --> 03:51:29.973]  Donald Trump, 50% to 42%.
[03:51:30.033 --> 03:51:32.735]  That's a 7 point jump from last week.
[03:51:32.855 --> 03:51:35.297]  You see, he's supposed to just sit there and let them steal it.
[03:51:35.478 --> 03:51:37.660]  But he didn't sit there, so they failed.
[03:51:38.672 --> 03:51:45.691]  And they think they're gonna have another stolen general election in front of everybody at high noon, and we're just gonna sit here and go along with it.
[03:51:45.851 --> 03:51:46.192]  We're not.
[03:51:47.236 --> 03:51:47.957]  I'm gonna fight it.
[03:51:48.217 --> 03:51:49.057]  Trump's gonna fight it.
[03:51:49.298 --> 03:51:50.018]  You're gonna fight it.
[03:51:50.158 --> 03:51:52.240]  Bob Mulholland from Chico, California.
[03:51:52.260 --> 03:51:53.321]  I'm a DNC member.
[03:51:53.361 --> 03:51:55.422]  That's a superdelegate to the National Convention.
[03:51:55.702 --> 03:51:56.463]  First of all, it's rigged.
[03:51:57.063 --> 03:51:58.765]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged.
[03:51:58.805 --> 03:51:59.545]  I have to be honest.
[03:52:00.186 --> 03:52:05.069]  And the way we work is that anybody who gets 15% more in an election gets delegates.
[03:52:05.209 --> 03:52:07.231]  So this election will go all the way to California.
[03:52:07.571 --> 03:52:11.274]  Sanders will end up with well over a thousand delegates and Hillary will get the nomination.
[03:52:11.514 --> 03:52:20.216]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[03:52:20.316 --> 03:52:21.256]  It has been rigged.
[03:52:21.396 --> 03:52:33.119]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and marginally to
[03:52:33.759 --> 03:52:35.640]  Facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[03:52:35.800 --> 03:52:44.045]  If Hillary steals the nomination, and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[03:52:44.425 --> 03:52:49.688]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public, contrary to popular belief.
[03:52:50.048 --> 03:52:51.589]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[03:52:52.583 --> 03:52:53.804]  That's a very good question.
[03:52:53.844 --> 03:52:57.665]  WikiLeaks has dumped nearly 20,000 hacked emails from the DNC.
[03:52:57.685 --> 03:53:04.909]  We're talking about the report of leaked DNC emails showing an effort to undermine Bernie Sanders during the primaries.
[03:53:05.249 --> 03:53:09.611]  The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.
[03:53:10.331 --> 03:53:15.273]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[03:53:15.353 --> 03:53:16.374]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[03:53:16.574 --> 03:53:20.276]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[03:53:20.596 --> 03:53:21.516]  And guess what there is?
[03:53:21.736 --> 03:53:23.637]  She stole the nomination.
[03:53:23.937 --> 03:53:26.658]  I want to thank Bernie Sanders.
[03:53:27.659 --> 03:53:32.501]  If he would have just not done anything, just go home, go to sleep, relax, he would have been a hero.
[03:53:32.661 --> 03:53:34.402]  But he made a deal with the devil.
[03:53:34.422 --> 03:53:34.942]  She's the devil.
[03:53:34.962 --> 03:53:36.383]  He made a deal with the devil.
[03:53:37.964 --> 03:53:43.828]  The media has created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination and that's the concept, that's the conflict here.
[03:53:43.868 --> 03:53:45.809]  We feel like we live in a democratic society.
[03:53:45.849 --> 03:53:51.133]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation.
[03:53:51.233 --> 03:53:53.494]  Crooked Hillary thinks they're gonna pull the lid on Mitt Romney?
[03:53:53.695 --> 03:53:54.475]  Mm-hmm, lady.
[03:53:54.495 --> 03:53:55.636]  It ain't gonna happen.
[03:53:55.856 --> 03:54:00.959]  That's why her campaign head, her chief strategist said, this is dangerous what Trump's doing.
[03:54:01.360 --> 03:54:02.761]  You're right, it is dangerous, isn't it?
[03:54:03.401 --> 03:54:04.702]  Actually standing up to you.
[03:54:04.982 --> 03:54:07.564]  There has to come a point at which you say, enough.
[03:54:22.116 --> 03:54:33.987]  We are back for the final segment of the Alex Jones Show and again I want to remind you to go to infowarslife.com where we've got 20% off Living Defense, the harmful organism cleanser.
[03:54:34.007 --> 03:54:37.271]  20% discount right now at infowarslife.com.

[03:54:41.257 --> 03:54:55.224]  Now, of course, Donald Trump came out yesterday with his extreme vetting proposal where, God forbid, he said that people coming into the United States would have to support equality, women's rights, LGBT rights, of course.
[03:54:55.844 --> 03:55:02.748]  The left, the regressive left, was absolutely horrified about this because they don't support equality.
[03:55:03.328 --> 03:55:04.750]  Because they're complete hypocrites.
[03:55:04.770 --> 03:55:06.832]  They're not real liberals.
[03:55:06.892 --> 03:55:08.514]  They're regressive leftists.
[03:55:08.894 --> 03:55:12.838]  They will sacrifice their principles on a whim in the name of political correctness.
[03:55:13.840 --> 03:55:17.382]  So CNN's Sally Cohn came out with this tweet about five hours ago.
[03:55:17.802 --> 03:55:19.123]  Hey, Donald Trump!
[03:55:19.703 --> 03:55:28.828]  Many progressive Muslims, the ones we should support in the ideological fight against extremism, believe in Sharia!
[03:55:29.668 --> 03:55:35.311]  That's right, CNN's Sally Cohn is saying that Sharia law is progressive!
[03:55:35.991 --> 03:55:40.633]  Okay, let's just run through a quick list of the characteristics of Sharia law, okay?
[03:55:40.974 --> 03:55:41.474]  Under Islam.
[03:55:42.725 --> 03:55:45.307]  Theft is punishable by amputation of the right hand.
[03:55:45.728 --> 03:55:46.568]  That's progressive.
[03:55:47.069 --> 03:55:50.392]  Criticizing or denying any part of the Quran is punishable by death.
[03:55:50.772 --> 03:55:51.693]  That's progressive.
[03:55:52.093 --> 03:55:56.096]  Criticizing Muhammad or denying that he is a prophet is punishable by death.
[03:55:56.397 --> 03:55:57.257]  That's progressive.
[03:55:57.558 --> 03:56:01.201]  Criticizing or denying Allah, the God of Islam, is punishable by death.
[03:56:01.301 --> 03:56:02.122]  That's progressive.
[03:56:02.542 --> 03:56:07.146]  A Muslim who becomes a non-Muslim is punishable, you guessed it, by death.
[03:56:07.466 --> 03:56:08.488]  That's progressive.
[03:56:08.808 --> 03:56:12.875]  A non-Muslim who leads a Muslim away from Islam is punishable by death.
[03:56:13.255 --> 03:56:16.921]  A non-Muslim man who marries a Muslim woman is punishable by death.
[03:56:17.261 --> 03:56:22.069]  A man can marry an infant girl and consummate the marriage when she is nine years old.
[03:56:22.890 --> 03:56:25.451]  A woman can have one husband who can have up to four wives.
[03:56:25.711 --> 03:56:27.012]  Mohammed can have more.
[03:56:27.412 --> 03:56:30.253]  A man can beat his wife for insubordination.
[03:56:30.713 --> 03:56:32.974]  It goes on and on and on.
[03:56:33.314 --> 03:56:37.436]  And according to CNN's Sally Cohn, it's all progressive.
[03:56:38.176 --> 03:56:41.558]  Yeah, she actually came out and said that in a tweet.
[03:56:41.918 --> 03:56:44.399]  I guess this is progressive as well out of the express.
[03:56:45.059 --> 03:56:49.161]  Transgender woman killed after she's mutilated and burned in street attack.
[03:56:50.080 --> 03:56:55.741]  The body of a transgender woman has been found mutilated and burnt in the street in the latest of a string of gay hate crimes to rock.
[03:56:56.242 --> 03:56:56.702]  Turkey.
[03:56:57.482 --> 03:57:01.003]  Turkey is 99.8% Muslim.
[03:57:01.303 --> 03:57:13.006]  They don't tend to like LGBT people, which is why Donald Trump came out with this extreme vetting proposal to say that you need to believe in LGBT rights to be allowed into the country.
[03:57:13.826 --> 03:57:17.789]  But according to Sally Cohn, that's not progressive enough.
[03:57:17.889 --> 03:57:30.276]  We need to believe in Sharia law, which completely disenfranchises women, disenfranchises gay people, leads to them being thrown off the top of buildings, because again, that's progressive.
[03:57:30.777 --> 03:57:32.158]  Another progressive
[03:57:33.123 --> 03:57:39.068]  Thing here out of the express, girls as young as nine forced into marriage by imams and authorities are powerless.
[03:57:39.688 --> 03:57:46.373]  Marriage amongst migrant children living in Germany is on the rise with girls as young as nine made to take part in sick wedding ceremonies.
[03:57:46.434 --> 03:57:48.155]  Again, under Sharia law.
[03:57:48.615 --> 03:57:52.698]  According to CNN's Sally Cohn, that is progressive.
[03:57:52.758 --> 03:57:55.501]  It's progressive to have your hand chopped off for theft.
[03:57:56.061 --> 03:57:59.445]  You know, female genital mutilation, that's progressive.
[03:57:59.746 --> 03:58:01.628]  Forced marriage, that's progressive.
[03:58:01.888 --> 03:58:05.553]  Stoning women to death who are accused of adultery, that's progressive.
[03:58:05.913 --> 03:58:07.876]  According to the regressive left.
[03:58:08.196 --> 03:58:10.639]  According to CNN's Sally Cohn.
[03:58:11.460 --> 03:58:12.881]  Moving on, this is out Truth Revolt.
[03:58:13.421 --> 03:58:15.043]  Feminists, all men are rapists.
[03:58:15.143 --> 03:58:19.125]  Feminists can be such charming people with all their talk of castrating God and killing babies in the womb.
[03:58:19.646 --> 03:58:24.549]  Only a man drowning in the excess of his own misogyny would reject a date with somebody as the lovely Julie Bindle.
[03:58:25.009 --> 03:58:33.715]  Again, she went on Twitter and basically said that all men need to be put in prison and shot dead because that's progressive.
[03:58:33.775 --> 03:58:34.656]  She won't be banned.
[03:58:34.996 --> 03:58:37.658]  She'll be free to continue that hatred.
[03:58:38.138 --> 03:58:39.399]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[03:58:39.519 --> 03:58:42.961]  I will be back tomorrow with Mike Cernovich talking about Hillary's health.
[03:58:43.501 --> 03:58:48.345]  InfoWars Nightly News coming up and stay tuned for the website InfoWars.com.

[03:59:02.333 --> 03:59:06.596]  A Chicago-based communist revolutionary group was blamed by Milwaukee
