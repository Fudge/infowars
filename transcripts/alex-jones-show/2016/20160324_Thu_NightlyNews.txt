[00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:22.030]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.860]  It is Thursday, March 24th, 2016 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:27.083]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:47.790]  Tonight, the pussification of American colleges and universities have become an epidemic, as students at Emory University in Atlanta are frightened, threatened, and intimidated over chalked messages throughout campus that say Trump 2016.
[00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:58.339]  Meanwhile, almost 60 professors at American University's Washington College of Law have signed an open letter to the law school community.
[00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:05.824]  Charging that the words all lives matter is racist and constitutes white supremacy.
[00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:16.451]  And a student at Columbia University has authored an editorial saying that the Belgians deserve to be blamed for the terrorist attacks in Brussels.
[00:01:16.692 --> 00:01:17.052]  Why?
[00:01:17.252 --> 00:01:20.554]  Well, because their society is Islamophobic.
[00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:23.556]  All that plus much more up next on the Info Wars 1980.

[00:03:03.072 --> 00:03:14.075]  Well, it's almost tax time, so for those of us who failed to sign up for Obamacare, we're going to be feeling the burn of the hefty penalty for not going out and getting that really affordable care.
[00:03:14.535 --> 00:03:25.217]  But you might also be feeling the burn in another place in your wallet, because health insurance premiums have increased faster than wages in recent years, rising an average of 28% from 2009 to 2014.
[00:03:29.378 --> 00:03:33.419]  Now, the Obama administration expressed concern about this in 2009.
[00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.861]  They were concerned about, it was a report called, The Burden of Health Insurance Premium Increases on American Families.
[00:03:40.281 --> 00:03:43.302]  And they were concerned that premiums had increased by 5.5% from 2008 to 2009.
[00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:46.723]  But in just a year after Obamacare was first enacted, premiums increased by 9.4%.
[00:03:55.425 --> 00:03:58.593]  And now, since 2014, they've gone up an average of 28%.
[00:04:01.024 --> 00:04:02.925]  Wages have only increased by 12.2%.
[00:04:04.606 --> 00:04:09.009]  So some of you out there might be really upset about these crushing costs.
[00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:18.054]  I know we have a lot of people, some people even saying that they're now getting hit from their auto insurance, saying that they have to cover the rising premiums with Obamacare.
[00:04:18.094 --> 00:04:18.995]  So that'll be interesting.
[00:04:19.035 --> 00:04:23.578]  Please send in any of your stories if that is indeed happening to you as well.
[00:04:24.058 --> 00:04:27.260]  Well, now we have Chelsea Clinton out shilling for her mom.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.949]  So there's a new video of her coming out and blasting these crushing costs of President Barack Obama's signature legislation.
[00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:42.676]  And she also tells the crowd that her mom, Hillary Clinton, is open to using executive action.
[00:04:43.297 --> 00:04:45.460]  To reduce these crushing costs of Obamacare.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.141]  So isn't that great?
[00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:59.579]  We had one dictator who used executive action to mandate his Obamacare, and now we have another one who's going in there saying that she's going to be using her dictatorial powers to reduce the cost, make it more affordable.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.464]  You'll remember that in December, Hillary Clinton admitted that Obamacare does indeed turn full-time jobs into part-time jobs.
[00:05:07.904 --> 00:05:12.107]  She encouraged a woman who was complaining about how expensive her health insurance was.
[00:05:12.487 --> 00:05:15.369]  She said, you know what, go back to the exchange and just check it again.
[00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:16.690]  Maybe the costs have gone down.
[00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.113]  And of course, she regularly emphasizes this fact in February.
[00:05:22.173 --> 00:05:25.055]  Just recently in February, she was praising Obamacare.
[00:05:25.777 --> 00:05:27.617]  I want to defend the Affordable Care Act.
[00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:33.558]  It is one of the great accomplishments, not only of this president, but of the Democratic Party going back to Harry Truman.
[00:05:33.938 --> 00:05:44.180]  The Republicans are determined to repeal it, and they've tried 62 times.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.461]  Senator Sanders and I share the same goal.
[00:05:46.581 --> 00:05:48.961]  We want to get to universal healthcare coverage.
[00:05:49.341 --> 00:05:53.022]  Before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare, as you remember.
[00:05:53.342 --> 00:05:54.542]  I fought really hard.
[00:05:55.302 --> 00:05:58.786]  So you see, the new puppet will be just as same as the old puppet.
[00:05:58.806 --> 00:06:06.814]  And of course, Hillary Clinton did say that she was going to be your best choice to make sure that Obama's agenda continues to roll on.
[00:06:07.194 --> 00:06:17.746]  Now, the Obama administration has been unrelenting in its fight to force a group of Catholic nuns to violate their beliefs and pay for abortion-causing drugs and contraception.
[00:06:18.306 --> 00:06:26.052]  Meanwhile, some other health plans have been grandfathered in, so they're not subjected to this mandate.
[00:06:26.072 --> 00:06:32.016]  And of course, those are some big corporations like ExxonMobil, Chevron, Visa, and PepsiCo.
[00:06:32.416 --> 00:06:33.477]  Jakari Jackson has more.
[00:06:34.818 --> 00:06:38.959]  Obamacare is back in the news cycle with arguments being heard before the Supreme Court.
[00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:44.740]  You have many Republicans saying it's the worst thing on the planet, many Democrats saying it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.700]  That's not my issue.
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:54.322]  Today I simply want to address who should pay for it, especially when it comes to the more controversial measures such as abortion or today's topic, contraception.
[00:06:54.682 --> 00:06:58.483]  And that's exactly the point of the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic organization.
[00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:11.903]  I'm no legal expert, but we did feel that the court heard our point that the government is trying to hijack our health care plan to insert the services that are in violation of our faith.
[00:07:12.303 --> 00:07:15.986]  So that's really what I took away from it was that they were hearing that argument.
[00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:20.331]  Many times when people talk about contraception, you hear the moniker, it's my body, it's my choice.
[00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:23.994]  And if you think about that, if it's your body and it's your choice, why is it somebody else's money?
[00:07:24.014 --> 00:07:25.135]  Why is it Hobby Lobby's money?
[00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.192]  Why is it the Catholic Church's money or anybody else's finances for that matter?
[00:07:43.632 --> 00:07:46.313]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:07:48.354 --> 00:07:55.058]  Switching gears now from news out of the mental institutions once known as institutions of higher learning.
[00:07:55.458 --> 00:08:01.821]  Now we have a group of law school professors saying that all lives matter is white supremacy.
[00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:03.302]  So these were almost
[00:08:03.302 --> 00:08:13.625]  Almost 60 professors at American University's Washington College of Law, they've signed an open letter to the law school community charging that the words, All Lives Matter, constitute white supremacy.
[00:08:13.665 --> 00:08:23.249]  The professors composed this letter after an unidentified person at the law school placed a handwritten sign reading, All Lives Matter, on a faculty member's door.
[00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:32.492]  Now, it was placed near a flyer for a training program on police violence and near flyers for other social justice and racial equality events.
[00:08:33.092 --> 00:08:37.938]  Such placement is assuredly an act of speech suppression, they proclaimed.
[00:08:38.319 --> 00:08:49.172]  So they say in context, the message appears intended by the messenger to be an attempt to silence and intimidate an opposing viewpoint, not an effort to communicate a different perspective.
[00:08:49.733 --> 00:08:57.257]  So now law professors are making the argument that you cannot place a sign next to other signs.
[00:08:57.477 --> 00:08:59.759]  Maybe those signs made this person uncomfortable.
[00:08:59.819 --> 00:09:04.141]  Maybe they felt like they were being bombarded with the perspective they weren't entirely comfortable with.
[00:09:04.401 --> 00:09:05.222]  And so they just put up...
[00:09:05.882 --> 00:09:11.765]  A sign next to this sign, but you can't do that now because you are silencing someone else's viewpoint.
[00:09:11.925 --> 00:09:15.247]  Your viewpoint doesn't matter if people, you know, are frightened by it.
[00:09:15.947 --> 00:09:18.348]  It's a completely, just completely insane.
[00:09:18.748 --> 00:09:19.389]  But that's not all!
[00:09:19.869 --> 00:09:29.313]  We also have dozens of college students being in fear after someone wrote Trump 2016 in chalk across campus.
[00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:30.194]  So these were
[00:09:30.934 --> 00:09:40.421]  About 40 to 50 students at Emory University in Atlanta, they requested a meeting with the school's president after they saw these words scrawled across campus.
[00:09:41.162 --> 00:09:41.642]  It was written...
[00:09:42.805 --> 00:09:51.649]  In chalk on buildings and sidewalks, the students said that they were threatened by the intimidating messages and they voiced genuine concern and pain.
[00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:54.410]  They had a little stop-hate protest.
[00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.633]  And speaking with The Wheel, one of the freshmen there said, My reaction to the chalking was one of fear.
[00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:06.355]  I told myself that it was a prank and that the responsible individual was probably laughing in their room.
[00:10:06.776 --> 00:10:09.317]  I told myself that Emery would do something about it.
[00:10:10.417 --> 00:10:12.320]  Another student said they were alarmed.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:19.387]  And the guy said, I thought, okay, it's just a guy who wants to write whatever he wants to believe in for his political campaign.
[00:10:19.768 --> 00:10:23.332]  I was like, okay, I'm fine with that to a certain extent.
[00:10:23.352 --> 00:10:26.255]  They're calling this the chalking.
[00:10:27.356 --> 00:10:30.517]  And another person said, it was like cross-burning.
[00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:31.518]  Yes.
[00:10:31.938 --> 00:10:35.299]  I mean, they have trivialized someone writing in chalk.
[00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:40.581]  Trivialized cross-burning and equating it to someone writing in chalk.
[00:10:40.661 --> 00:10:45.782]  This is the wimpiness of what we're dealing with on college campuses.
[00:10:46.203 --> 00:10:47.203]  And that's not it.
[00:10:47.243 --> 00:10:55.586]  But the Emory University president has vowed to hunt down this student whose Trump 2016 message wrecked the safe space.
[00:10:56.246 --> 00:11:05.098]  He also announced that he would review security footage in hopes of identifying the perpetrators and subjecting them to the conduct violation process.
[00:11:08.427 --> 00:11:13.952]  And a libertarian writer, Jeffrey Tucker, said he was the one that said it was like cross-burning.
[00:11:13.972 --> 00:11:17.395]  So this is coming from a libertarian point of view, which I find very surprising.
[00:11:17.756 --> 00:11:19.177]  He says it was like cross-burning.
[00:11:19.537 --> 00:11:20.719]  It was on private property.
[00:11:21.099 --> 00:11:22.640]  It was extremely damaging.
[00:11:22.761 --> 00:11:25.203]  And the students and faculty were totally embarrassed.
[00:11:25.603 --> 00:11:28.526]  It was absolutely intended to intimidate everyone.
[00:11:29.267 --> 00:11:30.508]  And it worked.
[00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:37.432]  Now we have another very special op-ed coming out of Columbia University.
[00:11:37.672 --> 00:11:42.515]  And this is a student claiming that Belgians are to blame for the Brussels attack.
[00:11:42.995 --> 00:11:44.776]  This is a student at Columbia University.
[00:11:45.457 --> 00:11:53.462]  He blames Tuesday's Islamic terrorist attack in Brussels on Belgians because their society is a front of Islamophobia.
[00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:58.605]  Columbia's vigils and memorial services allow us to mourn victims and condemn terrorism.
[00:11:59.065 --> 00:12:08.690]  Moving forward, however, they should condemn not only terrorism, but also the specific Islamophobic attitudes and policies that facilitated the recent attacks.
[00:12:09.531 --> 00:12:21.858]  He is, uh, this person is a freshman planning to study French, as well as women, gender, and sexuality studies, and no doubt they're going to be saying that they demand free college once they can't get a job once they graduate.
[00:12:22.438 --> 00:12:31.428]  But goes on to argue that the Brussels attack and other terrorist attacks are usually not arbitrary events without any justification.
[00:12:31.869 --> 00:12:36.454]  They often are responses to institutionalized hate and oppression.
[00:12:36.935 --> 00:12:39.958]  So now this person is saying, if you go...
[00:12:41.319 --> 00:12:49.482]  Watch out whoever chalked that university with Trump 2016, because now you have just justified terrorism.
[00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:56.744]  Because people there were saying that the hate and the oppression, well, you know, if they've been triggered, well now in the future it's okay.
[00:12:56.784 --> 00:13:01.005]  Terror attacks are totally fine if killing innocent people is completely justified.
[00:13:01.385 --> 00:13:07.847]  I wonder what he has to say about this video that came out of a Muslim woman ripping up an Israeli flag
[00:13:08.748 --> 00:13:11.292]  At a memorial for the attacks there in Brussels.
[00:13:11.733 --> 00:13:13.075]  It was a makeshift memorial.
[00:13:13.796 --> 00:13:15.719]  We can go ahead and roll that B-roll there now.
[00:13:17.082 --> 00:13:31.965]  So you'll see that this woman has so much hate in her heart that she can't even allow the few moments to pay respects to the dead long enough to just have to rip up this flag and place it under other things.
[00:13:32.005 --> 00:13:33.125]  But that's completely fine.
[00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:35.906]  I mean, that's her opinion matters.
[00:13:36.046 --> 00:13:37.386]  Your opinion does not matter.
[00:13:37.986 --> 00:13:40.446]  And if you disagree, you're racist.
[00:13:40.846 --> 00:13:41.627]  You're totally racist.
[00:13:42.247 --> 00:13:42.947]  And that's not it.
[00:13:44.804 --> 00:13:47.887]  That's not the end of the insensitivity when it comes to this.
[00:13:48.007 --> 00:13:57.256]  A No Borders activist reacted to the horrific attacks in Brussels by welcoming them as a good opportunity for migrants to exploit the chaos.
[00:13:57.977 --> 00:14:00.980]  Now, this was just hours after these attacks took place.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.401]  Kiera Lavernac, she describes herself as a freelance troublemaker.
[00:14:05.901 --> 00:14:08.042]  She wrote, Eurostar to Brussels suspended.
[00:14:08.422 --> 00:14:11.763]  Lille Airport is taking some of the planes due to land in Brussels.
[00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:15.884]  It could mean some chaos and good chance some people will go to the UK.
[00:14:16.304 --> 00:14:18.525]  Sorry, there is a good side to everything.
[00:14:18.885 --> 00:14:22.970]  So she posted these comments to the Calais Migrant Solidarity Facebook page.
[00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:29.797]  And of course, other people were countering her argument saying, you're saying it's a good side to people being killed this morning?
[00:14:30.118 --> 00:14:33.121]  And she said, whether it's a good side, it's totally irrelevant to me.
[00:14:33.522 --> 00:14:36.945]  Before she urged migrants to exploit the buildup of traffic.
[00:14:37.606 --> 00:14:41.268]  At Kalei Eurostar remarking, tell your friends in the jungle.
[00:14:41.828 --> 00:14:43.089]  So there you go.
[00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:45.730]  I mean, people don't even have any sympathy for the dead.
[00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.592]  They have sympathy for the people who are putting on these terrorist attacks.
[00:14:49.892 --> 00:14:52.253]  Don't hurt the poor terrorist feelings.
[00:14:52.953 --> 00:14:54.514]  And of course, Germany.
[00:14:54.534 --> 00:15:01.839]  Now you'll remember they had the hugging thing there at the migrant camps after there was the mass molestation on New Year's Eve.
[00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:10.825]  Well now they've also given 150,000 free condoms to refugees to tackle the negative perceptions about migrant sex attacks.
[00:15:11.365 --> 00:15:13.006]  This was back in October.
[00:15:13.086 --> 00:15:22.833]  Organizations had encouraged German condom manufacturers to donate free condoms and distribute them to migrant camps in order to give people what they need most.
[00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:40.746]  And of course, this was an attempt to tackle the negative perceptions that were held by German citizens following the mass molestation of women in Cologne on New Year's Eve and incidents like last month's brutal rape of a 10-year-old boy by an Iraqi migrant at a swimming pool
[00:15:41.346 --> 00:15:41.866]  In Vienna.
[00:15:42.607 --> 00:15:51.453]  And Paul Joseph Watson goes on to point out that this is Germany making sexual education a centerpiece of its migrant welcoming policy.
[00:15:52.033 --> 00:16:05.843]  Breitbart's Oliver Stone documented that the German government is also funding a website for newly arrived refugees that gives life lessons in sex, including different positions, prostitution, and how to engage in casual sex.
[00:16:06.483 --> 00:16:09.725]  So liberal and so loving.
[00:16:10.908 --> 00:16:14.790]  Now, while all of this is going on, let's just check in with the president.
[00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.091]  What does he have to say about this?
[00:16:17.191 --> 00:16:18.792]  This is my number one priority.
[00:16:20.793 --> 00:16:22.274]  I've got a lot of things on my plate.
[00:16:24.115 --> 00:16:36.841]  But my top priority is to defeat ISIL and to eliminate the scourge of this barbaric terrorism that's been taking place around the world.
[00:16:38.084 --> 00:16:45.213]  And we see high-profile attacks in Europe, but they're also killing Muslims throughout the Middle East.
[00:16:46.795 --> 00:16:48.137]  People who are innocent.
[00:16:49.859 --> 00:16:56.788]  People who are guilty only of worshipping Islam in a different way than this organization.
[00:17:00.014 --> 00:17:01.995]  Well, sorry about that, President Obama.
[00:17:02.015 --> 00:17:14.761]  I hate to have to cut your trip short, but the FBI Director James Comey has acknowledged that this attack will inspire some copycats, and the Brussels bombers did plan to attack a nuclear power station.
[00:17:15.161 --> 00:17:19.843]  Now, they are getting in some more reports after being able to get into these guys' apartments.
[00:17:20.103 --> 00:17:22.285]  They found 12 hours of reconnaissance footage.
[00:17:23.405 --> 00:17:37.517]  Showing that they were about to attack a nuclear power plant, and in fact these attacks were planned for this coming Monday, but they had to switch their targets to the Brussels airport following the arrest of their accomplices this week.
[00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:40.920]  Well stick around because we've got more coming up.
[00:17:52.987 --> 00:18:02.549]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.730]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:05.470]  Think about it.
[00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:11.452]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:18:11.712 --> 00:18:12.612]  But on the other hand,
[00:18:13.072 --> 00:18:17.295]  The Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:18:17.675 --> 00:18:29.422]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:18:29.702 --> 00:18:32.484]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:18:32.664 --> 00:18:35.145]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:18:35.466 --> 00:18:39.908]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:18:40.349 --> 00:18:40.909]  Think about it.
[00:18:41.109 --> 00:18:52.358]  This is Darren McBreen and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and listen to the Alex Jones Show because there's a war on in your mind.
[00:19:02.086 --> 00:19:05.789]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very, very carefully.
[00:19:06.533 --> 00:19:14.485]  Because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many, many people around me.
[00:19:15.026 --> 00:19:21.455]  I was a big sports enthusiast, but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old up to about 22 or so.
[00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:28.102]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:34.408]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work, I stopped working out.
[00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:39.193]  And everything was okay for four or five years, but then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:43.096]  And in the next 10 years, I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:56.459]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances, and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight, and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.040]  I even changed my diet.
[00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.742]  I even increased the exercise.
[00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:00.303]  It didn't work.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:06.190]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed
[00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.177]  My whole life changed.
[00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:14.844]  I've gone from 200 and almost 80 pounds down to about 220 pounds or so.
[00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:16.446]  It is incredible.
[00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:24.635]  And in just the last three years, Super Male Vitality, developed by Dr. Grube for mfulworthslife.com exclusively,
[00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:32.462]  And products like the Survival Shield X2 Nascent Ionine have just done incredible things for my body.
[00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:40.090]  I work out less, even though I'm older, I've lost more weight, my muscles got stronger, my stamina, my libido, and so much more.

[00:23:02.594 --> 00:23:04.216]  David Knight for InfoWars.com.
[00:23:05.076 --> 00:23:09.801]  I've been looking at the Utah results and there's a lot there that looks very suspicious.
[00:23:09.861 --> 00:23:12.143]  Of course, it's a pattern that we have seen before.
[00:23:12.983 --> 00:23:24.634]  Not only were there allegations of irregularities at the polling places, but of course we also saw somehow an overnight surge of more than 20 points in the support for Ted Cruz.
[00:23:25.114 --> 00:23:26.395]  And I can't find any
[00:23:27.076 --> 00:23:28.017]  We're good to go.
[00:23:50.416 --> 00:24:02.469]  One person gave us his first-hand reports, and you probably saw this linked on the Drudge Report, talking about how once they got their initial credentials, they didn't check their credentials as they went into the room and were handed presidential ballots.
[00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:06.573]  They seated them in rows and passed the ballots down the rows.
[00:24:06.613 --> 00:24:07.314]  He was at one end.
[00:24:07.354 --> 00:24:10.417]  He said, at one point, I'm sitting there holding 50 ballots in my hand.
[00:24:11.218 --> 00:24:16.543]  Then they had them mark the ballots and put them in the collection plate that they passed around, essentially.
[00:24:17.344 --> 00:24:19.125]  A very unusual procedure.
[00:24:19.445 --> 00:24:22.748]  Anyone who's ever voted at primaries, it doesn't happen that way.
[00:24:22.768 --> 00:24:32.317]  Of course, that's where you can interject fraud, is not having the credentials, not having custody of the ballots, not maintaining the sanctity of the ballot box.
[00:24:32.377 --> 00:24:33.958]  And that's the key point right there.
[00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:36.501]  He waited after everybody had left.
[00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:43.290]  He said about 15 minutes after everyone thought it was over and had left, some people came in with boxes full of envelopes.
[00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:47.294]  And then those envelopes were stuffed anywhere from two to five ballots.
[00:24:47.335 --> 00:24:48.756]  And he said, what in the world is this?
[00:24:49.497 --> 00:24:51.139]  They said, well, these are absentee ballots.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.142]  He was somebody that had election experience.
[00:24:54.823 --> 00:24:58.306]  Election absentee ballots aren't brought to the caucus locations.
[00:24:58.966 --> 00:25:00.668]  This is very suspicious.
[00:25:01.028 --> 00:25:02.309]  They told him he had to leave.
[00:25:02.889 --> 00:25:08.514]  Which point he walks out, there's another room where they're starting the caucus and he was curious as to what was going on there.
[00:25:08.534 --> 00:25:10.256]  He was allowed to just walk into that room.
[00:25:10.296 --> 00:25:13.339]  He could have voted a second time if he had wanted in that room.
[00:25:13.979 --> 00:25:25.832]  So there you see, in a really short area, the fact that they're not vetting the voters' credentials, maintaining tight supply, making sure they don't vote multiple times, making sure the ballot is not stuffed, all of that was violated.
[00:25:26.392 --> 00:25:34.501]  Think about how damaging it would have been if instead of just doing a first-hand report, he had actually pulled out his phone and had filmed it.
[00:25:35.422 --> 00:25:37.363]  That's what they don't want to see happen.
[00:25:37.883 --> 00:25:40.804]  That's why they're working on electronic voting machines.
[00:25:40.824 --> 00:25:48.307]  Because with electronic voting machines, you can vote, and they can show you exactly what you chose, and then they can transmit whatever they wish.
[00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:51.388]  It's easy for them to manipulate the totals as well.
[00:25:51.448 --> 00:25:56.050]  And of course, it can also be hacked easily by a third party, in case they haven't put the software in.
[00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:03.996]  Unlike a slot machine at a casino, you're not allowed to do on-site inspections of these people.
[00:26:04.036 --> 00:26:08.600]  You can't do background checks on them like you would the people who own and operate casinos.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:14.765]  Anyone from the top of the organization to the programmers in the organization could have criminal backgrounds.
[00:26:14.785 --> 00:26:16.206]  You're not allowed to investigate that.
[00:26:16.726 --> 00:26:22.191]  And of course with a slot machine, the software has to be kept on file at the state.
[00:26:23.117 --> 00:26:27.358]  But with a voting machine, the software is completely secret.
[00:26:27.738 --> 00:26:28.499]  Proprietary.
[00:26:28.699 --> 00:26:30.179]  Nobody is allowed to look at it.
[00:26:30.819 --> 00:26:33.300]  These are the issues that we need to be concerned about.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.941]  And we need to be concerned especially with this company, Smartmatic.
[00:26:37.821 --> 00:26:44.784]  At the very top, we have someone who is a George Soros confidant, former president of the World Bank.
[00:26:45.104 --> 00:26:49.165]  Someone who heads George Soros' Open Society Foundation.
[00:26:50.492 --> 00:26:58.977]  That should be enough to concern you right there, because of course we all know that George Soros has been dedicated to destroying what he calls American supremacy.
[00:26:59.518 --> 00:27:03.480]  But there's also the Marxist connection in the DNA, and it's very genesis.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.262]  This company, Smartmatics, began in the late 1990s in Venezuela.
[00:27:07.723 --> 00:27:17.449]  There's a couple of engineers there who didn't really have any experience in elections, they had experience in banking software, but they had relations and connections to Hugo Chavez.
[00:27:19.166 --> 00:27:25.630]  In 2004, when Hugo Chavez was facing a recall election, at that point even the communists had had it with this kleptocrat.
[00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:31.614]  Looked like he was a shoo-in to lose this election, and they got smart-matics.
[00:27:31.654 --> 00:27:36.338]  He paid them $120 million in 2004 for this election.
[00:27:36.398 --> 00:27:41.501]  Think about how much money that is for a country as small and as poor as Venezuela.
[00:27:42.282 --> 00:27:47.626]  Today, we have Venezuelans having to go to other countries, and of course we have Bloomberg talking about this.
[00:27:48.607 --> 00:27:54.230]  Having to go to other countries in order to get water, in order to get food, in order to get medicine, because they can't get it in their country.
[00:27:54.510 --> 00:28:06.295]  They've had hyperinflation, and yet Bloomberg brags that Venezuela, under Chavez and his Marxist successor, has been a great investment for Wall Street, returning 700% return on investment.
[00:28:07.055 --> 00:28:08.076]  So they want to keep it that way.
[00:28:08.676 --> 00:28:10.337]  And the way they did it was with Smartmatic.
[00:28:10.757 --> 00:28:16.340]  Of course, they won that election as people all over the world were looking at it, calling it fraud.
[00:28:17.432 --> 00:28:26.465]  They had people from MIT and Harvard, mathematicians, analyzing the data as it was being posted online, and showing suspicious patterns.
[00:28:27.006 --> 00:28:30.832]  Well then, at that point, Venezuela took down the data, so they couldn't do any more data analysis.
[00:28:32.059 --> 00:28:38.702]  We had an auditing conducted of the election, and they were given a clean bill of health, as always happens.
[00:28:39.122 --> 00:28:45.125]  No matter how corrupt the country, they will always be given a clean bill of health in the elections.
[00:28:45.925 --> 00:28:53.128]  Everyone wants to maintain this fiction of honest, sanctified elections, and nothing could be farther from the truth.
[00:28:53.549 --> 00:28:54.989]  But the people in Venezuela didn't believe it.
[00:28:55.029 --> 00:29:00.492]  The opposition parties all refused to participate in the next election as long as Smartmatic was involved.
[00:29:01.092 --> 00:29:06.853]  Then they moved from there to Mexico a couple of years ago in the Tabasco region.
[00:29:07.693 --> 00:29:14.455]  They made such a mess of the elections there that the Mexican government said, you will have to return eight and a half million pesos.
[00:29:15.055 --> 00:29:24.577]  They said that there were 80 candidates who contested the elections, who wanted it investigated, and they refused to let the semantic executives and engineers leave the country.
[00:29:25.557 --> 00:29:26.377]  In Brazil,
[00:29:27.458 --> 00:29:28.778]  There was a situation.
[00:29:28.798 --> 00:29:32.420]  We had a Marxist who just got elected in 2014.
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.221]  Very unpopular there, just like Hugo Chavez.
[00:29:35.261 --> 00:29:36.941]  She had destroyed the country's economy.
[00:29:37.742 --> 00:29:40.182]  She was down in the polls by nearly 10%.
[00:29:40.983 --> 00:29:45.104]  She was booed by 60,000 people at a World Cup Stadium event.
[00:29:45.764 --> 00:29:47.305]  But then, somehow, she won.
[00:29:48.658 --> 00:29:50.680]  This is the pattern that we see over and over again.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:58.407]  And of course, in that particular election, the tell-tale signs were no exit polling, just as we have seen no exit polling in Utah either.
[00:29:59.287 --> 00:30:14.161]  Very unusual when you see someone automatically, with an overnight surge like Ted Cruz had, of 20 points from the previous night, and there is absolutely no exit polling, and the involvement of this company, Smartmatics.
[00:30:14.741 --> 00:30:16.442]  They were also involved in the Philippines.
[00:30:16.482 --> 00:30:20.443]  They're still trying to undo the damage done in that election.
[00:30:21.343 --> 00:30:26.565]  They had in the election, they had 76% only of the ballots reported.
[00:30:27.166 --> 00:30:36.189]  Those 24% of the ballots that they never got from Smartmatic represented millions of votes in elections that turned on tens of thousands of votes.
[00:30:36.809 --> 00:30:39.790]  So we see over and over again this pattern of corruption.
[00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:48.032]  Now, the Venezuelan connection with Smartmatics came to America via their purchase of an American company called Sequoia.
[00:30:49.433 --> 00:30:49.993]  The U.S.
[00:30:50.053 --> 00:30:51.493]  Congress got very concerned about it.
[00:30:51.513 --> 00:31:05.157]  They said, we need to investigate this because we have mechanisms and committees set up to look at the investments of foreign corporations, the United States, when it involves our national security or our defense.
[00:31:06.249 --> 00:31:12.633]  As they started to investigate this, it was shut down and they said, no, elections don't involve our national security or defense.
[00:31:12.973 --> 00:31:20.338]  Let me tell you something, it is far easier to conquer a country using the ballot box than it is the cartridge box.
[00:31:21.018 --> 00:31:22.479]  That's what we have to be concerned about.
[00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:34.567]  The connection with George Soros, the connection with the Castro's, with the Hugo Chavez's, with the Central and South American dictatorships, with this country, with this company rather, Smartmatics,
[00:31:35.487 --> 00:31:38.788]  That now wants to get itself involved in the United States.
[00:31:39.448 --> 00:31:45.409]  And of course, back in 2006, the Bush administration was furious about the Hugo Chavez elections in Venezuela.
[00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.050]  They were crying fraud.
[00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:48.710]  They said it had been rigged.
[00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.931]  They tried to investigate it, as I mentioned.
[00:31:51.431 --> 00:31:59.733]  But now, here we are ten years later, and the GOP, which is openly announcing the fact that it is going to rig the elections,
[00:32:00.433 --> 00:32:12.624]  wants to get these electronic voting machine companies, the very company that they had targeted as part of a Marxist operation from Hugo Chávez, the Castro brothers, George Soros, to rig our elections.
[00:32:12.724 --> 00:32:15.306]  Now they are embracing them, using them.
[00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:16.467]  Why would they do that?
[00:32:17.248 --> 00:32:26.599]  As I've said before, the Democrats and the Republicans, the establishment, the upper echelon, the elite of those parties, understand what their critical path is.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.182]  Their critical path is open borders.
[00:32:29.422 --> 00:32:35.569]  Their critical path are these trade treaties where they can control, take down, and manage and redistribute our wealth
[00:32:37.091 --> 00:32:41.194]  From country to country and the climate treaties that are coming up.
[00:32:41.614 --> 00:32:47.198]  Those three things, the open borders, the trade treaties, the climate treaties, those must go through.
[00:32:47.518 --> 00:32:48.579]  They must go through now.
[00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:06.941]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:33:07.322 --> 00:33:14.446]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:33:15.047 --> 00:33:23.412]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:33:23.672 --> 00:33:27.775]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:33:28.095 --> 00:33:33.439]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:33:33.439 --> 00:33:34.500]  We're good to go.

[00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:07.152]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:07.413 --> 00:35:21.859]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:22.819]  We're good to go.
[00:35:43.365 --> 00:35:51.211]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:51.371 --> 00:35:56.796]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a 6-day liver detox.
[00:35:56.816 --> 00:36:00.338]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:00.518 --> 00:36:04.522]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:08.545]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:08.865 --> 00:36:09.045]  I'm good.
[00:37:05.163 --> 00:37:17.513]  Ipsos Public Affairs, a social research corporation, put out a global research project trying to find out what Trump's America First message, if it resonated with a global audience.
[00:37:17.593 --> 00:37:21.476]  They wanted to find out the global resonance of anti-immigrant rhetoric.
[00:37:21.676 --> 00:37:23.598]  And maybe they were surprised to find out...
[00:37:24.218 --> 00:37:31.882]  That in a global context, a strong plurality of global citizens believe that immigrants do take jobs away from their countrymen.
[00:37:32.262 --> 00:37:38.906]  And additionally, a near majority of global citizens understand that immigrants also take away social services.
[00:37:39.266 --> 00:37:42.750]  So you can look at the graph there and you can see it's just totally racist.
[00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.732]  These are just all racist countries.
[00:37:45.132 --> 00:37:57.184]  No, this is people around the globe who understand that when you bring people in who are going to vie for the same jobs at a much lower pay scale are going to compete with jobs as well as social services.
[00:37:57.525 --> 00:37:59.086]  It's just facts and science.
[00:37:59.707 --> 00:38:00.528]  But that's not all.
[00:38:00.548 --> 00:38:07.134]  In recent weeks, Trump has also been mocked by critics for saying that China is killing us economically.
[00:38:07.574 --> 00:38:19.105]  But a new analysis of US-China trade shows that the trade gap isn't just at a historic high, but in fact, the imbalance is the widest for any bilateral trade ever.
[00:38:19.545 --> 00:38:21.467]  So this is according to the website howmuch.net.
[00:38:21.487 --> 00:38:21.627]  The U.S.
[00:38:21.647 --> 00:38:24.490]  exported $116 billion to China in 2015, and the same year China exported $481 billion to the United States.
[00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:25.370]  So that's a $365 billion gap.
[00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:26.331]  You can see that little
[00:38:38.422 --> 00:38:38.783]  I think so.
[00:38:58.248 --> 00:39:08.335]  In early March 2016, the Spanish company Sintra Zachary, who partnered with TxDOT to build the controversial TCC, or Trans-Texas Corridor, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
[00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:12.258]  Many of the highway's critics celebrated the news of the toll road company's failure.
[00:39:12.679 --> 00:39:15.481]  But this is just a single battle won in a much larger war.
[00:39:15.821 --> 00:39:22.546]  This battle, which InfoWars covered extensively in the past, is over the construction and completion of a NAFTA superhighway, or corridor.
[00:39:23.206 --> 00:39:36.624]  Building on the massive displacement of humanity caused by globalization, the New World Order is rapidly constructing the physical infrastructure of the North American Union, the NAFTA Superhighway Control Grid.
[00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:47.350]  The TCC was the first leg to be completed of this new transportation system that would physically unite Canada, the United States, and Mexico into one borderless trade zone.
[00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:59.140]  The proposed Trans-Texas Corridor would be a patchwork of superhighways and railroads stretching 4,000 miles from the border of Mexico, cutting through Texas to Oklahoma.
[00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:12.336]  As we covered in our film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, the plan for a North American superhighway included a high-speed rail system that would transport cargo from Mexico non-stop to an inland small port in Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:23.062]  Economic trade deals and supranational committees, such as the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, signed in secret in 2005, have paved the way for massive multinational corporate projects.
[00:40:24.107 --> 00:40:25.388]  But what happened to this scheme?
[00:40:25.949 --> 00:40:30.472]  Now, with Sintra filing for bankruptcy, it would seem that this larger-than-life plan simply fizzled out.
[00:40:30.652 --> 00:40:32.034]  However, this is not the case.
[00:40:32.374 --> 00:40:38.399]  In 2011, the highly criticized TTC plan was shot down by the Texas Legislature when they passed HB 1201.
[00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:43.423]  But HB 1201 had many amendments attached that would keep the Spanish-owned Sintra satisfied.
[00:40:43.723 --> 00:40:54.327]  Just days after HB 1201 passed, which killed the TCC on the surface, Texas State Representative Larry Phillips introduced HB 3789, which brought the corridor back to life with a vengeance.
[00:40:54.767 --> 00:41:07.251]  Sentra's original deal with TxDOT was considered a PPP, or Public-Private Partnership, essentially a sweetheart deal, giving an offshore privately owned company the same powers of the state, such as the power to change the state's speed limit.
[00:41:07.791 --> 00:41:17.863]  HB 3789 strengthened these private-public partnerships, giving more power to offshore monopolies by giving them the authority to sign deals with the state of Texas in secret.
[00:41:18.084 --> 00:41:23.230]  I-35, the central artery of the Texas interstate system, is considered part of the NAFTA superhighway.
[00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:28.114]  And the Kansas City Inland Port, which is part of the TCC, is now up and running.
[00:41:28.494 --> 00:41:33.898]  Other NAFTA super corridors, whose construction began around the same time as the TCC, have also never ceased.
[00:41:34.239 --> 00:41:38.282]  One plan in particular, the Canamex Corridor, runs along the west coast of North America.
[00:41:38.582 --> 00:41:46.909]  According to Canamex.org, the Canamex Corridor project is a broad-reaching plan whose key objective is to create a direct trade route from Canada to Mexico.
[00:41:47.169 --> 00:41:50.852]  This initiative is being supported for its development and implementation by the U.S.
[00:41:50.892 --> 00:41:51.973]  states en route for this plan.
[00:41:52.273 --> 00:41:55.235]  Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.
[00:41:55.475 --> 00:41:59.397]  The website continues to describe some of the longer-term plans for the Trade Corridor.
[00:41:59.577 --> 00:42:07.261]  The Canamex Corridor was also specified by NAFTA to include a railroad system to match the advances in highway construction and vehicles with advanced rail systems.
[00:42:07.521 --> 00:42:18.107]  These are intended to take the form of larger, longer, and more efficient trains, making the maximum use of technologies such as double-decker cars and multiple engines that can pull immensely long trains.
[00:42:18.387 --> 00:42:21.529]  The Canamex Corridor is currently being managed by several companies.
[00:42:21.869 --> 00:42:31.232]  And like a Connect the Dots puzzle, it's slowly linking smaller highway systems to form a larger trade route that will run from the southern border of Mexico all the way to the northern one in Canada.
[00:42:31.612 --> 00:42:32.453]  In March 2015, U.S.
[00:42:33.293 --> 00:42:38.495]  Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake added corridor extensions to the Intermountain West Corridor Act of 2015.
[00:42:39.895 --> 00:42:47.258]  According to the Phoenix Business Journal, this federal act was also extended to the I-11 corridor north from Las Vegas to Reno and northward to Canada.
[00:42:47.498 --> 00:42:56.363]  So, plans for North American trade corridors, governed by secret committees and international trade agreements like the SPP, and now the TPP, are moving forward.
[00:42:56.583 --> 00:43:04.088]  The Kansas City Inland Smart Port is open for business, and it does not seem like the central bankruptcy did much, if any, to damage their long-term goals.
[00:43:04.448 --> 00:43:08.070]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:43:09.414 --> 00:43:17.185]  Well, one of the things we talk about a lot here at InfoWars is what happens when someone has just too much power and there's no one checking that power.
[00:43:17.665 --> 00:43:19.428]  Well, we're not talking about politics.
[00:43:19.788 --> 00:43:23.934]  That's actually the theme of the Batman vs. Superman movie.
[00:43:24.895 --> 00:43:34.342]  Now, of course we could equate that with the present political presidential election, but this movie has a major political storyline.
[00:43:34.403 --> 00:43:51.116]  It involves Senate hearings questioning Superman's actions, and one of the Senators actually utters Thomas Jefferson's words, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and Ben Affleck says the movie is more about what happens when we become afraid of one another.
[00:43:51.596 --> 00:43:59.866]  So here to give us a little bit of historical accuracy is our resident comic book geek, Jakari Jackson.
[00:44:11.189 --> 00:44:13.850]  The movie Batman v. Superman is set for its U.S.
[00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:19.213]  release in just a few hours from now, and some of the film's stars are chiming in saying the themes that are within it.
[00:44:19.653 --> 00:44:25.756]  Actress Holly Hunter said that her role in the film is to explain what happens when absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:35.520]  And also Ben Affleck, who portrays Batman in the film, says that he doesn't view it as being overtly political, but says that it does point out what could go wrong when people don't trust one another.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.261]  Now, I've yet to see the film.
[00:44:37.361 --> 00:44:47.910]  I plan to do so in a couple of hours from now, so this isn't going to be so much of a spoiler-filled analysis, but I will point out some of the things that are in the book, The Dark Knight Returns, which the movie is heavily based on.
[00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:56.577]  Basically, Superman becomes a tool of the government, and the government uses him to shut down other superheroes, giving the state a legitimate monopoly of force.
[00:44:57.017 --> 00:45:01.561]  Batman eventually has to take Superman down and that's pretty much what you guys see in the movie trailers.
[00:45:01.981 --> 00:45:11.930]  Now, I don't know Frank Miller's exact thoughts on the book, Frank Miller being the author of the book, but I think what he is trying to say is that you can't have the government having a monopoly of force
[00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:19.196]  And if it does get to that point, you can't have normal common people rise together and defeat a tyrannical government.
[00:45:19.556 --> 00:45:21.037]  But you have to do so responsibly.
[00:45:21.137 --> 00:45:32.707]  Now there is a scene within the book where the sons of Batman, a vigilante group inspired by Batman, go out into the streets seeking justice, but Batman has to stop them and say, hey, if you're going to do this, you have to do this a proper way.
[00:45:33.027 --> 00:45:38.817]  So yes, people can come together and fight against the tyranny of the time, but you have to do so in a responsible way.
[00:45:39.238 --> 00:45:41.922]  Stay tuned for more reports here on InfoWars.com
[00:45:54.318 --> 00:45:57.799]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:45:57.879 --> 00:46:01.260]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:06.142]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:46:06.162 --> 00:46:09.063]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:46:09.183 --> 00:46:15.125]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:46:15.325 --> 00:46:18.909]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:21.932]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:46:22.033 --> 00:46:30.562]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:46:31.619 --> 00:46:40.341]  ...is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:46:40.441 --> 00:46:45.582]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:46:46.102 --> 00:46:49.742]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:46:49.862 --> 00:46:51.883]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:46:51.963 --> 00:46:54.383]  Is it one world the central bank was in charge?
[00:46:54.443 --> 00:46:56.824]  Know your history and you will know your enemy.
[00:46:57.164 --> 00:46:58.284]  InfoWars.com
[00:47:03.007 --> 00:47:04.008]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:06.833]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.113 --> 00:47:14.966]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:13.917 --> 00:49:21.659]  Dozens of college students in fear, close quote, in Atlanta after Trump 2016 chalked across campus.
[00:49:22.079 --> 00:49:24.660]  Not Trump KKK, which the false flaggers do.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:25.320]  No, no, no.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:33.922]  Trump 2016 and they're now having psychologists in meetings and having to cancel part of the school as everyone goes in and says, we're scared!
[00:49:34.642 --> 00:49:36.423]  We saw the Trumps!
[00:49:38.456 --> 00:49:40.157]  It was almost as bad as Yale.
[00:49:40.558 --> 00:49:45.621]  And the two professors over that department sent an email saying, listen, costume parties are part of freedom.
[00:49:45.641 --> 00:49:46.602]  This is true liberalism.
[00:49:46.902 --> 00:49:52.306]  You're allowed to, you know, have different ideas and dress like you want and just, you know, you have your freedom as well.
[00:49:52.587 --> 00:49:58.071]  And so they caught him out in the square and began screaming at him and threatening him and threatening to hit him and going, help me!
[00:49:58.091 --> 00:49:59.071]  I'm scared!
[00:49:59.412 --> 00:49:59.852]  I'm not safe!
[00:49:59.952 --> 00:50:02.094]  Oh my gosh, you're hurting me!
[00:50:02.134 --> 00:50:06.357]  I mean, I can't even scream as loud and as hysterically and as freaked out as they did and guess what?
[00:50:06.417 --> 00:50:07.398]  Yale fired both of them.
[00:50:08.418 --> 00:50:10.560]  Fire the people that dare say there was freedom!
[00:50:11.061 --> 00:50:25.755]  InfoWars journalist Adon Salazar writes, several students at Emory University in Atlanta requested a meeting with the school's president after the words, Trump 2016 were scrawled across campus.
[00:50:26.195 --> 00:50:31.800]  The college news site, The Tab, published several photos of the chalking.
[00:50:32.541 --> 00:50:49.311]  Jim Wagner, the university president, said Tuesday he had spoken with some 40 to 50 students after they claimed they were triggered by the words Trump 2016 and other pro-Trump messages written in chalk on buildings and sidewalks around campus.
[00:50:49.631 --> 00:51:00.718]  The students said they were threatened by the intimidating messages and voiced genuine concern and pain to administrators, reports the Associated Press.
[00:51:01.098 --> 00:51:06.300]  The Emory Wheel reports one student said, I'm supposed to feel comfortable and safe here.
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:16.023]  But this man is being supported by students on our campus and our administration shows that they, by their silence, support it as well.
[00:51:16.344 --> 00:51:20.105]  And I don't deserve to feel afraid at my school, she added.
[00:51:20.325 --> 00:51:29.434]  But individual students soon began to offer more detailed, personal reactions to feelings of racial tension that Trump and his ideology bring to the fore.
[00:51:29.634 --> 00:51:34.679]  Has this juvenile corrosion of freedom of choice reached other American campuses?
[00:51:34.999 --> 00:51:37.501]  The University of Texas, for example?
[00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:41.645]  If you saw Trump 2016 written on the ground right here, would that offend you?
[00:51:41.906 --> 00:51:45.449]  Would you rally with other students and alert the university president?
[00:51:45.729 --> 00:51:46.609]  It would offend me.
[00:51:46.629 --> 00:51:50.751]  I'm not sure I would go get the president of the university, but I'd be happy if someone did.
[00:51:50.771 --> 00:51:52.651]  I'd sadly try to rub it out.
[00:51:52.671 --> 00:51:57.213]  I think it just goes to show a lot about where our political process is at right now.
[00:51:57.933 --> 00:52:02.055]  So to just be kind of, I think, disappointed is my main reaction.
[00:52:02.295 --> 00:52:03.295]  No.
[00:52:03.415 --> 00:52:03.795]  Why not?
[00:52:03.855 --> 00:52:05.136]  Why wouldn't you be offended?
[00:52:05.156 --> 00:52:08.197]  People have a right to put in chalk Trump 2016 if they support him.
[00:52:09.074 --> 00:52:09.615]  Why would it offend you?
[00:52:27.199 --> 00:52:31.662]  Well, first of all, nobody should be writing their opinions on public streets.
[00:52:31.742 --> 00:52:36.746]  It's not the opinion of all the students in the body and it shouldn't be represented in our university.
[00:52:38.407 --> 00:52:41.890]  And because I don't want Trump to win president for 2016.
[00:52:44.406 --> 00:52:57.299]  Because I think he's a dangerous man who is dishonest, he lies, and he's using his money to manipulate poor people into voting for him.
[00:52:58.441 --> 00:53:01.063]  You can express political beliefs wherever you want.
[00:53:01.123 --> 00:53:05.127]  I think the First Amendment gives you that right, but I would just be disappointed, I think.
[00:53:06.131 --> 00:53:09.413]  I think society's becoming more polarized.
[00:53:10.113 --> 00:53:21.358]  People are either right-wing or left-wing, very extreme positions, and the moderates aren't very talkative and seem to be frozen out, so you have to support extreme positions to get elected, and that's no good anymore.
[00:53:21.678 --> 00:53:25.740]  Most of the students I tried to talk to had their heads buried in their phones.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:32.903]  The Independent reports the more time young adults spend on social media, the more likely they are to become depressed.
[00:53:33.223 --> 00:53:35.224]  Well, they haven't seen anything yet.
[00:53:35.524 --> 00:53:47.575]  Wait until Obama's policies come home to roost, as young millennial men and women are drafted and sent to the front lines, fighting the globalist wars with a battle cry of political correctness.
[00:53:47.935 --> 00:53:55.842]  Maybe by then they will have grown up and realized that words don't hurt you, but New World Order shrapnel certainly will.
[00:53:56.302 --> 00:53:57.663]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:11.212]  Dr. Manning joins us from atlah.org.
[00:54:12.213 --> 00:54:16.775]  He spearheaded the boycott nationwide to get Al Sharpton kicked off MSNBC.
[00:54:17.255 --> 00:54:19.637]  He is in the face of the dragon.
[00:54:19.977 --> 00:54:21.138]  He's got the eye of the tiger.
[00:54:21.158 --> 00:54:22.218]  He doesn't need to be introduced here.
[00:54:22.258 --> 00:54:26.141]  I appreciate him holding while I was ranting, but I am particularly getting wound up now.
[00:54:26.781 --> 00:54:28.242]  Because this is just crazy.
[00:54:28.902 --> 00:54:34.324]  Atla.org, Pastor Manning, thank you so much for coming on to give us your commentary and your analysis.
[00:54:34.344 --> 00:54:36.906]  You heard me ranting there, but this is real anger.
[00:54:37.006 --> 00:54:44.369]  I mean, this is getting so crazy, where they're arresting people that mildly criticize Islam, not just in Europe, but here.
[00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:46.870]  I want to ask you, who is the left?
[00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:48.191]  Who are these people?
[00:54:48.911 --> 00:54:57.433]  That would take the countries that have given them so much freedom, and then try to bring in the most radical forms of Islam that would literally murder them.
[00:54:58.654 --> 00:55:00.174]  Well, Alex, there are a couple of things.
[00:55:00.234 --> 00:55:01.734]  By the way, thank you so very much for having me.
[00:55:01.814 --> 00:55:05.095]  It's always a great honor to share on your broadcast.
[00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:05.836]  A couple of things.
[00:55:05.956 --> 00:55:14.118]  One, to your earlier point regarding the language that you... I mean, you've been broadcasting for 21 years, and we know that your language is always upscale.
[00:55:14.938 --> 00:55:29.303]  But with respect to what's happening now, especially with this transgender sexual ideology that's going on, they are counting on you using wimpy, if you will, politically correct language that they might be able to continue to advance their cause.
[00:55:29.383 --> 00:55:36.826]  So your language, if you don't get salty, you're going to get slaughtered by the politically correct crowd.
[00:55:37.326 --> 00:55:40.647]  The other thing is that you made mention of in your rant.
[00:55:41.407 --> 00:55:48.949]  First of all, Islam is the biggest con game in terms of getting people to go out to fight that I've ever heard of.
[00:55:49.189 --> 00:55:53.010]  You get promised 70 virgins in paradise if you get killed.
[00:55:54.071 --> 00:55:59.772]  If there's a con game of con games, that is the most unique of all con games.
[00:56:00.212 --> 00:56:04.893]  And yet it is pervasive among a billion people who believe that con game.
[00:56:05.714 --> 00:56:07.754]  And so they go out and they do all of this fighting.
[00:56:07.774 --> 00:56:09.735]  But I think the other thing is, Alex,
[00:56:10.612 --> 00:56:17.814]  With respect to what The View is going to say about Trump and about Brussels, what's happening there today.
[00:56:18.634 --> 00:56:33.479]  You know, I have this desire to look further and deeper into why is it that a city like Brussels or Paris, if you're looking at these recent... Yes, why are they hitting the places that literally roll out a red carpet to them?
[00:56:33.819 --> 00:56:34.099]  Yeah!
[00:56:35.179 --> 00:56:38.501]  That has to be another answer other than what we're getting from the dunghead media, Alex.
[00:56:38.741 --> 00:56:39.862]  I mean, I don't believe them.
[00:56:40.282 --> 00:56:45.205]  And we're going to have to look deeper, and perhaps you will have a, you know, just looking closer, this would have a better answer.
[00:56:45.465 --> 00:56:47.126]  Because it doesn't make sense.
[00:56:47.526 --> 00:56:52.289]  They're not hitting an organization or states or nations that are hostile to them in many ways.
[00:56:52.789 --> 00:57:00.494]  I mean, you go to Paris or France or Belgium as a Muslim, and you get treated, I mean, royally.
[00:57:01.094 --> 00:57:02.475]  They roll out the red carpet at you.
[00:57:02.635 --> 00:57:03.216]  So why?
[00:57:04.236 --> 00:57:12.818]  Is this happening here rather than some other nation perhaps where we might be a little bit more adverse to Islamic thought or ISIS in general?
[00:57:13.078 --> 00:57:14.018]  I don't understand that.
[00:57:14.478 --> 00:57:16.499]  But I don't believe what I'm seeing on the dunghead media.
[00:57:16.579 --> 00:57:17.119]  I just don't.
[00:57:17.759 --> 00:57:18.999]  So there's something else behind this.
[00:57:19.039 --> 00:57:23.560]  Well, clearly, I've talked to a lot of insiders and others and they say they're bringing them into attack.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.041]  Then they're going to make Christians and others control our speech as to not upset the Muslims.
[00:57:29.521 --> 00:57:31.882]  And they're also going to use it to roll out a police state against everybody.
[00:57:33.991 --> 00:57:38.256]  Now, if you guys have a little bit of time, be sure and check out the Info Wars store.
[00:57:38.296 --> 00:57:40.419]  We're running some really great specials there right now.

[00:58:18.145 --> 00:58:21.947]  And I don't know, it was just this little bit of toxic buildup that was here.
[00:58:22.747 --> 00:58:25.628]  It just melted away and I had tremendous success.
[00:58:25.648 --> 00:58:28.549]  So be sure, go to the InfoWars store for a limited time.
[00:58:28.569 --> 00:58:28.970]  We're running a 20%
