[00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.266]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:22.106]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:22.246 --> 00:00:24.447]  It's Monday, February the 8th, 2016.
[00:00:24.827 --> 00:00:26.147]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:29.888 --> 00:00:30.308]  Tonight.
[00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.891]  And just remember, there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other.
[00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:44.365]  Vote for a woman, or when you get to hell, tell them Hillary sent you.
[00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:55.312]  Then, eminent domain enters the presidential conversation, and Marco Rubio drives home the point that Obama knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:00:55.832 --> 00:00:59.595]  Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country.
[00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:02.557]  But I would add this, let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:01:02.597 --> 00:01:03.778]  He knows exactly what he's doing!
[00:01:04.278 --> 00:01:04.918]  That's next.
[00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:01.624]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.206]  You can't survive without it.
[00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:04.308]  But where do you get it?
[00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:10.375]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:16.302]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:33.360]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.881]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:36.242 --> 00:02:37.442]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:38.503]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:38.743 --> 00:02:39.364]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:39.664 --> 00:02:41.485]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:03:03.953 --> 00:03:15.641]  Well, we've had the Iowa caucus, but tomorrow night we have the very first primary in New Hampshire, and of course we're going to be here covering it live with the InfoWars Nightly News crew and with our crew who are on location live in New Hampshire.
[00:03:16.482 --> 00:03:21.506]  This weekend was a very important debate, and of course there were some important developments in this debate.
[00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:37.800]  When we look at the difference between the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary, the Iowa caucus hasn't been very successful in predicting a GOP nominee in recent times because it's really pretty much controlled by a small minority of evangelical kingmakers there.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.963]  But we have a different cross-section in New Hampshire.
[00:03:41.423 --> 00:03:46.647]  It is also the place where the establishment candidates feel that they have to have a strong showing.
[00:03:46.967 --> 00:03:49.829]  So they're fighting very hard for second place.
[00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.290]  Donald Trump is way ahead.
[00:03:51.771 --> 00:03:58.436]  The person who was looking to try to cash in on momentum from Iowa, that's part of the establishment, was Marco Rubio.
[00:03:59.016 --> 00:04:05.965]  His strategy was 3-2-1, finishing third in Iowa, coming in second in New Hampshire, and then maybe winning South Carolina.
[00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:07.747]  That seemed to be his path to victory.
[00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:11.151]  It took a big hit on the debate on Saturday night.
[00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:18.440]  We had an example of Marco Rubio essentially melting down, like we've never seen a candidate meltdown before.
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.824]  He went full on robot, as you see that graphic there.
[00:04:22.565 --> 00:04:26.110]  He went like a Terminator and maybe he terminated his campaign.
[00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.136]  He seems to be sinking in the polls like the anchor baby that he is.
[00:04:30.576 --> 00:04:35.122]  Now what happened, and we're going to play a brief excerpt from this in case you haven't heard it.
[00:04:35.703 --> 00:04:44.725]  But he continued to respond with this little 25-second memorized phrase that he used in a back-and-forth with Chris Christie.
[00:04:44.945 --> 00:04:49.906]  Even after Chris Christie called him out on the technique, he used it again and again.
[00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:51.887]  He repeated it at least four times.
[00:04:52.307 --> 00:04:56.808]  And then when he was questioned about it on the Sunday shows, he repeated it another three times.
[00:04:56.908 --> 00:04:58.628]  And this is what happened on Sunday morning.
[00:04:58.688 --> 00:05:01.949]  George Stephanopoulos led off the interview asking Rubio, what went wrong?
[00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:12.154]  To make Rubio go back to the rehearsed phrase so many times, and he took an interesting tack with Stephanopoulos, defending his repetition of the talking point by repeating it three more times.
[00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:14.175]  He didn't just double down, he tripled down.
[00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:17.397]  And of course, insiders are saying that he has crashed and burned.
[00:05:17.457 --> 00:05:22.119]  Here's what some of the people are saying to watch the debate, and you'll see it for yourself in just a second.
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.782]  Cringeworthy, badly programmed, robotic, so rehearsed it comes off as inauthentic.
[00:05:27.322 --> 00:05:31.183]  Exposed at last for the wind-up doll that he is.
[00:05:31.223 --> 00:05:32.563]  He botched the exchange with Christie.
[00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:33.763]  He sounded like a broken record.
[00:05:34.023 --> 00:05:38.004]  He was sweating so much that he looked like he needed Charlie Crist's fan blowing on him.
[00:05:38.484 --> 00:05:42.885]  Every answer in previous debates involved an Orwellian oration about Islamic jihadists.
[00:05:42.905 --> 00:05:48.946]  Tonight, it was Barack Obama that he kept repeating over and over again, but Christie didn't let him get away with it.
[00:05:49.026 --> 00:05:53.207]  So let's play that exchange between Chris Christie and Marco Rubio.
[00:05:54.116 --> 00:05:55.336]  That's what Washington, D.C.
[00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:55.636]  does.
[00:05:56.096 --> 00:06:05.538]  The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information, and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisors gave him.
[00:06:05.978 --> 00:06:07.419]  They had to shame you into going back.
[00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:12.620]  And then you stayed there for 36 hours, and then he left and came back to campaign.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.400]  Those are the facts.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.280]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.161]  This notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not true.
[00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:17.561]  There it is.
[00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:18.841]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:06:18.881 --> 00:06:19.501]  There it is.
[00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:21.282]  The memorized 25-second speech.
[00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:22.402]  There it is, everybody.
[00:06:23.653 --> 00:06:25.595]  Absolutely amazing exchange.
[00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:27.337]  Joining me now is Leanne McAdoo.
[00:06:27.938 --> 00:06:29.599]  Can you believe how that came down?
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.982]  I mean, he could not stop himself.
[00:06:32.022 --> 00:06:33.123]  He could not help himself.
[00:06:33.764 --> 00:06:37.748]  Even repeating it, as Chris Christie is pointing out, there he goes again.
[00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:39.270]  We're good to go.
[00:06:54.346 --> 00:06:58.288]  Right, whoever's back there pushing his buttons with his programming just kept hitting that same button.
[00:06:58.548 --> 00:07:00.349]  This was all we had prepared for the night.
[00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:01.350]  Truly robotic.
[00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.472]  Now, if you look at the results, and here's Politico, asked people who won the debate on Saturday night.
[00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:09.534]  Majority of people said Chris Christie did, at 30%.
[00:07:09.574 --> 00:07:14.257]  They asked them who lost the debate, and it was overwhelming for Rubio.
[00:07:14.317 --> 00:07:14.717]  Look at this.
[00:07:16.338 --> 00:07:24.844]  68% said Marco Rubio lost that debate and he continues to lose because he will not back down from this strategy.
[00:07:24.884 --> 00:07:27.086]  He wants to say, oh that's important, I've got to get that message out.
[00:07:27.366 --> 00:07:29.648]  Now another quick poll that was done on Sunday.
[00:07:29.988 --> 00:07:41.837]  This is an internal poll done by the Kasich campaign, so of course it is somewhat self-serving, but nevertheless his PAC, New Day for America Super PAC, shows Rubio plummeting to fourth place with just 10% of the vote.
[00:07:41.877 --> 00:07:42.257]  That was a
[00:07:42.677 --> 00:07:43.158]  I think so.
[00:08:01.613 --> 00:08:02.253]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:02.453 --> 00:08:05.015]  People believed that Obama was destroying the country.
[00:08:05.295 --> 00:08:09.337]  One of the first persons to support Marco Rubio, of course, was Phyllis Schlafly.
[00:08:09.617 --> 00:08:13.238]  She went there to support him in his Senate race in 2010.
[00:08:13.278 --> 00:08:24.544]  Of course, he hasn't finished a single Senate term and he's now running for president, but not before he betrayed the conservatives that were driven to the poll by seeing what Obama was doing, exactly what Rush is talking about.
[00:08:24.584 --> 00:08:27.305]  So now Phyllis Schlafly has put out a 15-page memo
[00:08:27.865 --> 00:08:35.294]  The Rubio betrayal memo where she documents all the different cases where he said he was going to do something and did exactly the opposite.
[00:08:35.354 --> 00:08:40.260]  He was the anti-amnesty candidate and then when he goes in he becomes part of the Gang of Eight.
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:46.447]  In 2006 he voted for a bill that would have allowed children of illegal immigrants to pay the same tuition rates at Florida schools on and on and on.
[00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:47.708]  The same thing we've seen.
[00:08:48.008 --> 00:08:50.570]  He is the establishment betrayal candidate.
[00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:58.697]  And then Limbaugh says, it's not the belief, it's not the theory, it's the knowledge that Obama is doing this on purpose and there hasn't been any pushback.
[00:08:58.777 --> 00:09:06.483]  Well, when we look at what Marco Rubio said, Leanne, when he was interviewed by Richard Reeves in New Hampshire, Richard asked him,
[00:09:06.983 --> 00:09:08.543]  About the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:09:08.583 --> 00:09:20.266]  And I find it amazing that when he can go in and give this little 25 second speech over and over again, let's dispel the fiction that Obama doesn't know what he's doing, he's undertaking a systematic effort to change this country and make America more like the rest of the world.
[00:09:20.586 --> 00:09:33.128]  And yet the same guy can say, and we have it at the beginning of that report, you can see it, he plays it before he talks to Rubio, it's more important than ever that Congress give the President trade promotion authority so he can finalize the Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic Partnership.
[00:09:33.148 --> 00:09:33.408]  Right.
[00:09:33.488 --> 00:09:37.529]  One of the biggest things that's going to fundamentally change this country, if not the globe.
[00:09:37.749 --> 00:09:39.150]  Yeah, it's absolutely amazing.
[00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.970]  And of course he talks about it as being free trade.
[00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:41.831]  It's not free trade.
[00:09:41.891 --> 00:09:43.051]  It is managed trade.
[00:09:43.371 --> 00:09:46.372]  It is 5,000 pages of managed trade.
[00:09:46.412 --> 00:09:48.893]  You don't need to have 5,000 pages if you've got free trade.
[00:09:49.273 --> 00:09:50.533]  And it's about a lot of other things.
[00:09:50.574 --> 00:09:51.594]  It's about controlling the internet.
[00:09:51.634 --> 00:09:58.296]  But fundamentally, what Richard Reeves was talking to him about was the fact that it destroys American sovereignty.
[00:09:58.656 --> 00:10:23.627]  And what he and Trey Gowdy, who Richard Reeves did a great job of finding Trey Gowdy, one of the congressmen who is campaigning with Marco Rubio, who endorsed him and also supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPA, what they have done is to shut down the constitutional process of ratifying a treaty and they're outsourcing their own jobs to a multinational commission that will manage our economy.
[00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:24.968]  That's what we're really talking about here.
[00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.629]  Right, an international tribunal that will decide everything.
[00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:34.430]  And also we were supposed to have about 90 days of a debate there after they released the transcripts there.
[00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.931]  I didn't see any debate happening.
[00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:36.591]  No, there hasn't.
[00:10:36.611 --> 00:10:38.631]  Now they've signed it, but it has to be ratified.
[00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:40.091]  Another indication that it's a treaty.
[00:10:40.392 --> 00:10:44.252]  They're saying that they're not going to have the actual vote now until after the presidential election.
[00:10:44.272 --> 00:10:50.574]  I hope we can count on them on doing that because really the only hope of stopping this now is with Donald Trump opposing it.
[00:10:50.894 --> 00:10:51.314]  I don't know.
[00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:13.465]  Jeb Bush is pulling out the big guns, okay?
[00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:21.290]  He was leading in New Hampshire initially before Donald Trump took over, and now he is pulling in his mom to campaign for him, and even Lindsey Graham.
[00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.031]  And listen to what Lindsey Graham said in New Hampshire.
[00:11:23.552 --> 00:11:28.995]  Lindsey Graham, who is now the comedy chops for Bush's warm-up act, and this is his joke where he warmed up.
[00:11:29.035 --> 00:11:35.219]  He says, introducing a Medal of Honor winner, he said, he spent six years at Hanoi Hilton, three of them with John McCain.
[00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:36.440]  Now that's real torture.
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.521]  Great job, Lindsey.
[00:11:38.803 --> 00:11:47.108]  But he even said, Lindsey Graham even said, as a supporter of Jeb Bush, he says, Jeb is all but finished if he doesn't come ahead of Rubio on Tuesday.
[00:11:48.211 --> 00:11:53.253]  And I've seen it in another article, they're saying that this could be Jeb's, you know, is he going to be the star now?
[00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:54.253]  Will he rise?
[00:11:54.293 --> 00:11:57.414]  I mean, they just don't, isn't it like 0.2%?
[00:11:57.554 --> 00:12:04.716]  Rubio had such a bad day with this debacle at the debate, now they're all talking about how Jeb has got momentum.
[00:12:04.736 --> 00:12:13.299]  See, that's the way they play it, they play it with the, you know, so if Jeb exceeds expectations, then he's the big winner, just like they gave the gold medal to Rubio for coming in third place.
[00:12:14.119 --> 00:12:20.987]  Let's play this exchange between Jeb and Trump, because this is Jeb's big bid to push Trump out of the way.
[00:12:21.027 --> 00:12:22.389]  They told him, hit him hard.
[00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:27.715]  So he had this idea of eminent domain, yet Jeb didn't know what he was talking about with eminent domain.
[00:12:29.013 --> 00:12:31.534]  Eminent domain, the Keystone Pipeline.
[00:12:31.554 --> 00:12:33.035]  Do you consider that a private job?
[00:12:33.615 --> 00:12:34.735]  I consider it a public use.
[00:12:34.775 --> 00:12:35.796]  No, no, let me ask you, Jeff.
[00:12:35.816 --> 00:12:37.576]  Do you consider the Keystone Pipeline private?
[00:12:37.596 --> 00:12:38.136]  It's a public use.
[00:12:38.196 --> 00:12:39.297]  Is it public or private?
[00:12:39.337 --> 00:12:40.077]  It's a public use.
[00:12:40.217 --> 00:12:40.497]  Oh, really?
[00:12:40.777 --> 00:12:41.418]  A public use?
[00:12:41.498 --> 00:12:42.738]  No, it's a private job.
[00:12:42.758 --> 00:12:43.218]  It's a public use.
[00:12:43.238 --> 00:12:43.878]  It's a private job.
[00:12:43.898 --> 00:12:45.559]  Established by the courts, federal, state courts.
[00:12:45.579 --> 00:12:50.141]  You wouldn't have the Keystone Pipeline that you want so badly without eminent domain.
[00:12:50.181 --> 00:12:50.681]  Exactly, I agree.
[00:12:50.701 --> 00:12:55.903]  You wouldn't have massive, excuse me, Judge, you wouldn't have massive factories without eminent domain.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.362]  Okay, Lance, so you see them going back and forth.
[00:13:01.023 --> 00:13:08.029]  Jeb is trying to attack Trump for using eminent domain for private purposes in his own life.
[00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:18.118]  And we have the crowd booing Donald Trump, and Donald Trump, before that clip that we played there, stops and addresses the crowd and says, look, I know you've been brought here because you're donors, okay?
[00:13:18.138 --> 00:13:19.179]  And he was right about that.
[00:13:19.359 --> 00:13:20.780]  And that was a part of the establishment.
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.502]  Yeah, that's part of the establishment taking him down.
[00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:27.487]  They sent in the GOP establishment, they sent in the GOP donors, and so forth and so on.
[00:13:27.507 --> 00:13:28.087]  So they were there.
[00:13:28.528 --> 00:13:31.511]  It was a small crowd, but a vocal crowd, booing Trump.
[00:13:31.531 --> 00:13:33.893]  But then they go back and forth on imminent domain.
[00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:39.099]  And Jeb Bush has absolutely no idea that the Keystone Pipeline is for private use.
[00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:41.081]  And he keeps arguing with Donald Trump about it.
[00:13:41.141 --> 00:13:42.242]  And it is for private use.
[00:13:42.482 --> 00:13:43.283]  It's a private use.
[00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:43.964]  And here's the thing.
[00:13:44.364 --> 00:13:59.148]  This is beyond the Kellogg v. London decision that the Supreme Court had to say, which said that a private company could be given another private corporation's land or property because of eminent domain.
[00:13:59.228 --> 00:14:03.268]  That was an affront to the use of eminent domain.
[00:14:03.549 --> 00:14:04.169]  But nevertheless,
[00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:09.933]  Went beyond private and they said, we're going to give it to a foreign corporation.
[00:14:09.973 --> 00:14:13.595]  They're going to be able to condemn property for the Keystone Pipeline.
[00:14:13.615 --> 00:14:15.377]  So he didn't even know what he was talking about.
[00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:15.677]  Right.
[00:14:16.037 --> 00:14:24.564]  Well, and also we've kind of seen something similar there in Nevada with the BLM and the Bundys and all the other ranchers there that were getting their land taken to protect the desert tortoise.
[00:14:24.744 --> 00:14:30.289]  And then we later find out that there's a Chinese solar company setting up solar farms there
[00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:35.814]  Well, that's the abuse that the government does with the taking of lands for public use.
[00:14:35.934 --> 00:14:40.918]  Saying, we're going to take it to protect the desert tortoise when they collect 1,200 desert tortoises and say, oh, you know what?
[00:14:41.359 --> 00:14:43.201]  We don't have the money to feed them, so let's just kill them now.
[00:14:43.381 --> 00:14:43.621]  OK?
[00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:46.904]  They're doing that as part of Agenda 21, and that's the abuse.
[00:14:46.944 --> 00:14:47.845]  That's where it needs to be stopped.
[00:14:47.885 --> 00:14:48.886]  And it can be stopped.
[00:14:49.386 --> 00:14:50.888]  At the state and local level.
[00:14:50.908 --> 00:14:51.889]  That's where it needs to be stopped.
[00:14:52.089 --> 00:14:53.610]  But the Keystone Pipeline comes in.
[00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:58.615]  That is something that was done on a national basis and it is turning this over to an international corporation.
[00:14:58.655 --> 00:15:00.157]  So they're both wrong on this.
[00:15:00.197 --> 00:15:08.104]  But then Trump goes on to point out that the Bush family used eminent domain to get a baseball park for their own.
[00:15:08.144 --> 00:15:11.628]  And this is something he pointed out on the Sunday show on ABC's This Week.
[00:15:12.348 --> 00:15:16.111]  Trump said, Jeb Bush doesn't understand what eminent domain means.
[00:15:16.231 --> 00:15:24.216]  If you look into the Bush family, I found this five minutes ago, they used eminent domain for the stadium in Texas where they own, I guess, a piece of the Texas Rangers.
[00:15:24.296 --> 00:15:27.858]  And George Stephanopoulos said, well, that was his brother, George W. Bush.
[00:15:27.878 --> 00:15:29.579]  He goes, it doesn't matter, it's the Bush family.
[00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:32.281]  They used eminent domain for private use.
[00:15:32.381 --> 00:15:33.442]  He didn't tell anybody.
[00:15:33.942 --> 00:15:35.524]  So, I mean, he should have told the people.
[00:15:35.564 --> 00:15:35.704]  Yeah.
[00:15:35.845 --> 00:15:37.427]  What he's doing is he's lying to people.
[00:15:37.467 --> 00:15:40.130]  He's saying, look, you know, I'm going to support private property.
[00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.154]  I'm not going to have two classes of private property ownership.
[00:15:43.214 --> 00:15:49.041]  One for the people who are rich and well-connected, and another one for the rest of you slaves who may or may not be able to own property.
[00:15:49.602 --> 00:15:50.803]  He takes that position.
[00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:54.105]  He doesn't even know the difference between public and private use.
[00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:58.428]  We've seen multiple abuses of public use of eminent domain.
[00:15:58.468 --> 00:15:59.529]  It should be shut down.
[00:15:59.569 --> 00:16:01.470]  There's ways that we should address that at the local level.
[00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.592]  But then he is guilty of the same thing he accuses Trump of.
[00:16:05.092 --> 00:16:05.293]  Right.
[00:16:05.353 --> 00:16:05.653]  Typical.
[00:16:06.073 --> 00:16:11.554]  Yeah, and these are the things, even with Rubio's talking points, they're being exposed.
[00:16:11.814 --> 00:16:20.997]  So all of their tactics, and that is one thing I've got to give it to Trump, he doesn't hold back and he does come with some low blows, but they weren't expecting that.
[00:16:21.677 --> 00:16:25.258]  He went after him for 9-11, no one was expecting that.
[00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:26.658]  Exactly.
[00:16:26.718 --> 00:16:31.481]  So I think it's very important for us to look at this and we'll talk about this a little bit more later on in the show.
[00:16:31.501 --> 00:16:37.565]  We're going to take a look at Trump's foreign policy and the fact that he's compared by a guy who doesn't agree with him.
[00:16:37.585 --> 00:16:42.387]  That's why the Brookings Institute says, look, this is like Robert Taft's foreign policy.
[00:16:43.388 --> 00:16:47.370]  What used to be the Republican Party's policy on foreign issues.
[00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.431]  America first.
[00:16:48.951 --> 00:17:06.946]  That is one area where there is a clear distinction, but when you look at these other areas, even though I vehemently disagree with Donald Trump on eminent domain, there is no difference between Donald Trump and Jeb Bush, just like there's no difference with these guys on the surveillance state, on the NSA, on all these abuses of civil liberties.
[00:17:07.006 --> 00:17:08.788]  There's not any difference between these guys.
[00:17:08.908 --> 00:17:14.692]  Right, and just like you say that it can be stopped at the local state level, that's where it's all happening.
[00:17:14.972 --> 00:17:25.078]  It's your real estate agents and people that are getting in with the big corporations, or they want to build some skyscrapers, and so that's where it is all happening, when Jeb Bush is the governor.
[00:17:25.098 --> 00:17:28.380]  That's the name of the game at the local level.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.822]  It's the real estate people that get into office with the mayor's office and go in.
[00:17:32.883 --> 00:17:37.285]  As we were talking about this earlier, we were talking about how in Tampa they would go in and
[00:17:38.726 --> 00:17:42.569]  create these ridiculous fines for not having, in poor neighborhoods.
[00:17:43.089 --> 00:17:44.230]  Your house needs to be repainted.
[00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.131]  So now we're going to fine you $200 a day.
[00:17:46.392 --> 00:17:50.975]  Very quickly the fines pile up and the people can't pay them, so the city takes their property.
[00:17:51.315 --> 00:17:56.259]  They condemn enough of these properties and take them that way, stealing them from the poor income people.
[00:17:56.639 --> 00:18:01.142]  And then they go in and condemn the remaining ones and they turn it into a sandlot.
[00:18:01.162 --> 00:18:05.645]  We had a mayor in Tampa, they called her, her name was Sandy Friedman, they called her Sandlot Friedman.
[00:18:05.946 --> 00:18:07.327]  Once she would get rid of all of the
[00:18:07.907 --> 00:18:11.288]  Houses that way, then she would turn it over to her buddies and they'd build a skyscraper.
[00:18:11.368 --> 00:18:13.429]  That's the corruption game at the local level.
[00:18:13.769 --> 00:18:16.330]  That's where it needs to be controlled at the local level.
[00:18:16.671 --> 00:18:26.635]  There is another game altogether and that is where the globalists are going to control our economy using these so-called partnerships, which are really treaties.
[00:18:27.055 --> 00:18:33.037]  That's where we can stop them at the national level and that's a very important thing that we're going to be looking at later on the show.
[00:18:33.057 --> 00:18:34.578]  Now when we come back from the break,
[00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:38.160]  We're going to take a look at some developments on the Democrat side.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.481]  What's going on with Hillary and Bernie?
[00:18:40.582 --> 00:18:42.082]  Clearly he has momentum.
[00:18:42.423 --> 00:18:43.823]  We'll be right back after the break.
[00:18:43.843 --> 00:18:44.324]  Stay with us.
[00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:13.659]  Look, I don't know what your problem is, but I simply cannot have students wandering the hallways during class, interrupting other classes, and giving prophecies of a great plague!
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.882]  We believe in win-win, folks.
[00:19:15.922 --> 00:19:17.664]  Treating people like we want to be treated.
[00:19:17.884 --> 00:19:22.449]  That's why we developed NutraCyticals with Dr. Group and other top researchers, chemists, scientists, you name it.
[00:19:22.589 --> 00:19:23.550]  He's one of our advisors.
[00:19:23.811 --> 00:19:29.297]  To come up with products like AnthroPlex that is an original product that he made just for us.
[00:19:30.218 --> 00:19:32.080]  And this is a base
[00:19:33.121 --> 00:19:33.961]  We're good to go.
[00:19:59.352 --> 00:19:59.992]  It'll sell out.
[00:20:00.312 --> 00:20:11.116]  So, Infowarslife.com, Anthroplex, 15% off and free shipping for the next two days only when you get it with Supermail or Female Vitality.
[00:20:11.216 --> 00:20:12.017]  Let's go to Dr. Group.
[00:20:12.197 --> 00:20:18.039]  Why do you call this the foundation to start the fire and then the Supermail takes you to the next level?
[00:20:19.264 --> 00:20:43.468]  Well, we just look at the base problem that's going on right now all over the world, which is the endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the amount of estrogen that men have, the femininity of men, and what's going on even in children right now with low testosterone levels, low sperm count levels, and the problems that, and the attack that we're seeing on the endocrine systems of both male and female.
[00:20:43.968 --> 00:20:53.015]  So I'm always looking for ways to boost that and to make it more effective and naturally get the body to start producing these hormones and balancing themselves.
[00:20:53.816 --> 00:21:03.903]  So what we decided to do is how can we add a few other components in there that would actually boost the effectiveness of the super male vitality and at the same time
[00:21:04.864 --> 00:21:06.925]  What is in the goat weed?
[00:21:07.005 --> 00:21:09.786]  You've got one of the purest, strongest organic forms of it.
[00:21:09.806 --> 00:21:11.067]  What's so magic about the goat weed?
[00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:37.132]  Well, the horny goat weed was given that name because years ago in India, they noticed that a certain time of the year, this weed would grow and the goats would eat it and they would just go crazy with all the female goats.
[00:21:37.232 --> 00:21:38.734]  So that's how it was developed.
[00:21:38.774 --> 00:21:39.695]  It's called epimidium.
[00:21:40.496 --> 00:21:47.202]  And what that's been proven to do over thousands of years is increase sexual pleasure, help balance the male hormones.
[00:21:47.242 --> 00:21:48.984]  It can actually be used for women as well.
[00:21:49.424 --> 00:21:56.310]  But it really kind of resets and brings the hormone balance, improves sperm motility, and increases testosterone levels.
[00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.312]  So it counters the stuff they've been throwing at us.
[00:21:58.572 --> 00:22:00.154]  Results will vary overall.
[00:22:00.594 --> 00:22:02.396]  All I know is dynamite.
[00:22:02.856 --> 00:22:07.681]  I mean, absolutely dynamite with stamina, with the weight lifting, with the swimming.
[00:22:07.921 --> 00:22:09.282]  Folks, the new product is available.
[00:22:09.863 --> 00:22:12.925]  AnthroPlex, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:13.306 --> 00:22:15.428]  Dr. Group, thank you for developing this amazing product.
[00:22:15.588 --> 00:22:15.888]  Thank you.
[00:23:03.442 --> 00:23:04.003]  Welcome back.
[00:23:04.083 --> 00:23:07.848]  Now, we've been looking at the GOP side of the New Hampshire primary.
[00:23:07.888 --> 00:23:09.991]  Let's take a quick look at the Democrat side.
[00:23:10.011 --> 00:23:15.258]  And, of course, the momentum there is with Bernie Sanders, the non-establishment candidate.
[00:23:15.569 --> 00:23:16.530]  Or so people think.
[00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:26.376]  I'm just kind of going back to Rubio's repeat where he's talking about Barack Obama, the first president that wants to change the country, change the country, not fix it.
[00:23:26.716 --> 00:23:33.440]  Well, that's exactly why young people like Bernie Sanders, because he promises that he is going to change this country.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.041]  Not really much of a change from where we are.
[00:23:36.061 --> 00:23:41.643]  You know, we talk about how this TPP is not free trade, it's managed trade.
[00:23:41.724 --> 00:23:43.044]  We don't have a free market.
[00:23:43.084 --> 00:23:44.745]  We've got a very managed economy.
[00:23:44.785 --> 00:23:49.407]  And so we really haven't tried and had free markets tried and failed.
[00:23:49.447 --> 00:23:52.308]  You know, they're talking about the Bernie Sanders idea.
[00:23:52.328 --> 00:23:56.310]  You know, he's going to be 75 when he becomes president, if he's elected.
[00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.192]  Everybody was amazed at how old Ronald Reagan was.
[00:23:59.252 --> 00:24:00.053]  Reagan was 69.
[00:24:00.493 --> 00:24:01.755]  Bernie Sanders is going to be 75.
[00:24:02.055 --> 00:24:05.438]  But, you know, his ideas are even older than he is.
[00:24:05.778 --> 00:24:06.959]  Okay?
[00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:08.741]  His ideas are senile.
[00:24:08.821 --> 00:24:10.702]  It's not democratic socialism.
[00:24:10.802 --> 00:24:12.344]  It's senile socialism.
[00:24:12.804 --> 00:24:20.411]  It's Bernie Sandinista, the guy who went down to the Sandinistas and just, you know, thought that was the greatest thing ever.
[00:24:20.891 --> 00:24:23.272]  Didn't learn anything from that debacle.
[00:24:23.312 --> 00:24:29.635]  And of course, that area was raped by the banks that Bernie Sanders says he opposes.
[00:24:29.795 --> 00:24:31.676]  So that's how this all turns out.
[00:24:32.036 --> 00:24:34.637]  But of course, Hillary is now playing the victim.
[00:24:34.717 --> 00:24:36.237]  We see all kinds of things coming out.
[00:24:36.277 --> 00:24:41.200]  We got Hillary Clinton's campaign is resisting releasing transcripts from her Goldman Sachs speeches.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.621]  At the same time, the feds are fighting for her.
[00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:46.882]  They're fighting disclosure of her whitewater indictment drafts.
[00:24:47.342 --> 00:24:54.071]  And we have the pressure on the Justice Department, Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General, to step aside in this Clinton email probe.
[00:24:54.091 --> 00:24:58.276]  Of course, I guess she's just a victim of negative campaigning, isn't she?
[00:24:58.736 --> 00:24:59.497]  Right, exactly.
[00:24:59.597 --> 00:25:01.319]  And it's never her fault.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.102]  So now there's reports.
[00:25:03.462 --> 00:25:10.004]  You know, as the FBI officially confirms today that yes, they are investigating Hillary Clinton's email server.
[00:25:10.044 --> 00:25:11.665]  They had to come out because of the State Department.
[00:25:12.065 --> 00:25:13.725]  They requested, you know, what are you guys up to?
[00:25:13.805 --> 00:25:15.146]  Are you investigating her or not?
[00:25:15.186 --> 00:25:17.427]  So they kind of want to see where they stand.
[00:25:17.867 --> 00:25:24.429]  But now, after this Iowa shakeup, the Clintons are actually weighing whether they should replace some of their staff.
[00:25:24.949 --> 00:25:26.450]  Because it's not her fault.
[00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:30.994]  It's not the staff's fault that they went in thinking they were just going to be campaigning for the first female president.
[00:25:31.374 --> 00:25:35.077]  Instead, they've been having to bat off all of her controversy, all of her scandals.
[00:25:35.517 --> 00:25:37.339]  Throw them under the bus.
[00:25:37.479 --> 00:25:38.700]  But of course, they should have understood.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:45.606]  It's their fault that she's getting such a negative... She's the one that wouldn't turn over her email server immediately and say, I've got nothing to hide.
[00:25:46.186 --> 00:25:47.206]  Well, just look at some of this stuff.
[00:25:47.226 --> 00:25:52.288]  I mean, going back to the, of course, the Democrats had a debate on Thursday night, the Republican debate that we were talking about earlier.
[00:25:52.328 --> 00:25:53.149]  That was on Saturday night.
[00:25:53.189 --> 00:25:59.171]  But the Thursday night before that, they asked Hillary if she would release the transcripts from the Goldman Sachs thing.
[00:25:59.191 --> 00:26:01.572]  She said, well, we'll look into it in the next day.
[00:26:01.592 --> 00:26:02.713]  She laughed about it first.
[00:26:02.733 --> 00:26:06.954]  The next day, somebody from her staff says, I don't think voters are interested in this.
[00:26:06.974 --> 00:26:08.235]  Well, you know, I would be interested.
[00:26:08.815 --> 00:26:12.417]  I would like to know why they paid her more than $600,000 in speaking fees.
[00:26:12.457 --> 00:26:15.159]  I mean, there's got to be some real words of wisdom in there.
[00:26:15.219 --> 00:26:15.439]  Right.
[00:26:15.499 --> 00:26:16.920]  Some real insights into life.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.362]  Maybe it was a really good stand-up comedy routine.
[00:26:20.382 --> 00:26:23.243]  You know, for $600,000, I'd like to see those transcripts.
[00:26:23.644 --> 00:26:24.824]  But that's the whole issue.
[00:26:25.144 --> 00:26:27.146]  She and Bill Clinton got paid $153 million in speaking fees.
[00:26:29.787 --> 00:26:31.088]  This was nothing but payola.
[00:26:31.408 --> 00:26:36.930]  And listen to what one of her press secretary, Brian Fallon, said to MSNBC.
[00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:43.012]  He said, they'll probably be asking for their money back when she's president because no one will regulate Wall Street more strictly than her.
[00:26:43.452 --> 00:26:50.735]  So, I guess he's kind of admitting that they were buying favors from her and she plans on not delivering on those favors.
[00:26:50.755 --> 00:26:54.496]  I mean, that's what we know, that an election is an advance auction of stolen goods and favors, right?
[00:26:54.696 --> 00:26:55.297]  Absolutely.
[00:26:55.657 --> 00:27:05.485]  Well, and that's kind of the big issue with the last debate where they were sort of sparring Sanders kind of artfully, according to Clinton, accusing her of being bought off.
[00:27:05.525 --> 00:27:11.370]  And that, of course, she'd sell out the country to these people who've already been donating heavily to her campaign.
[00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:15.914]  And then she retorted saying, well, then everyone who's run for president has to have been bought off, which
[00:27:16.874 --> 00:27:17.895]  Yes, that's probably true.
[00:27:18.395 --> 00:27:25.180]  But we have International Business Times, they're pointing out why Sanders is trying to focus on the issue of money in politics.
[00:27:25.841 --> 00:27:29.343]  And here are just some of the stories that we're dealing with right now.
[00:27:29.383 --> 00:27:36.248]  So we got the Wall Street Journal report on the Secretary of State helping a major bank that donated to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:27:36.628 --> 00:27:42.272]  New York Times reports on Clinton supporting a uranium deal that helped a Clinton Foundation donor.
[00:27:43.713 --> 00:27:44.093]  Very happy.
[00:27:44.113 --> 00:27:45.475]  They paid her off well in advance.
[00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.330]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:18.774]  And you've got the federal bureaucracy basically running interference for her, just like Judicial Watch is trying to get the disclosure of the Whitewater indictment draft documents and they're blocking that.
[00:28:19.154 --> 00:28:28.337]  You have number two Senate Republican John Cornyn in Texas going on the floor of the Senate last week calling for a special counsel because he said there's a conflict of interest
[00:28:28.797 --> 00:28:36.025]  To have Attorney General Lynch investigate, perhaps even prosecute somebody who was in the Obama administration with her.
[00:28:36.185 --> 00:28:36.345]  Right.
[00:28:36.445 --> 00:28:40.469]  But then she replies and says this matter is being reviewed by career attorneys and investigators.
[00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:41.670]  That's the problem!
[00:28:41.951 --> 00:28:46.255]  It's career attorneys and investigators who are going to run interference for Hillary Clinton.
[00:28:46.295 --> 00:28:48.157]  That's precisely what the problem is.
[00:28:48.277 --> 00:28:49.678]  The game is rigged!
[00:29:18.377 --> 00:29:18.897]  We're good to go.
[00:29:32.888 --> 00:29:35.229]  And yet you have this article that was on Drudge.
[00:29:35.349 --> 00:29:40.450]  Just because you might be the first woman president doesn't make you a real feminist, say some of her supporters, right?
[00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.710]  Exactly.
[00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.170]  They have to explain that to her.
[00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:47.471]  They interviewed some younger women in New Hampshire.
[00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:53.592]  One of them said, I think she's trying to appeal to young women voters by shouting feminism in our faces.
[00:29:54.072 --> 00:29:56.673]  But we are not a one-track-minded people.
[00:29:56.713 --> 00:29:58.193]  In other words, we're not that shallow.
[00:29:58.233 --> 00:29:59.194]  We're not that narrow.
[00:29:59.374 --> 00:30:00.054]  Well, we'll see.
[00:30:00.174 --> 00:30:01.294]  We'll see what happens with that.
[00:30:01.434 --> 00:30:14.120]  Right, well, and it's interesting, I mean, to voters under 30, they think Bernie Sanders is one of them, even though he's even older than Hillary Clinton, and he's been in politics since at least the 80s, but he just hasn't been in their face like Hillary Clinton has.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:22.804]  But it's interesting to see how just over the weekend we had Madeleine Albright, and who's the other lady, like these feminist icons coming out.
[00:30:22.924 --> 00:30:23.645]  Gloria Steinem.
[00:30:23.665 --> 00:30:29.688]  Gloria Steinem basically saying, girls, you're stupid and you're going to hell if you don't vote for Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:30.598 --> 00:30:33.139]  When you're young, you're thinking, you know, where are the boys?
[00:30:33.179 --> 00:30:37.941]  The boys are with Bernie, or, you know... You have to help.
[00:30:38.341 --> 00:30:41.042]  Hillary Clinton will always be there for you.
[00:30:41.682 --> 00:30:46.904]  And just remember, there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other.
[00:30:51.107 --> 00:30:53.830]  So that's how they, the tack that they're taking.
[00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:57.113]  Well, they want to make it all about the fact that she's a woman, okay?
[00:30:57.714 --> 00:31:04.281]  But as this article points out, women who accused Bill Clinton of assault to campaign against Hillary are going to campaign against this.
[00:31:04.341 --> 00:31:10.748]  This is a PAC that is being set up by Roger Stone, who we've interviewed, I think it was just last Thursday, we talked to him again.
[00:31:11.008 --> 00:31:13.791]  He's going to set up a PAC, and listen to the name of the PAC that he's going to set up.
[00:31:14.011 --> 00:31:20.635]  It's called the Rape Accountability Project for Education PAC, or that's R-A-P-E, the Rape PAC.
[00:31:21.056 --> 00:31:26.639]  And they're going to have Kathleen Willey, who went on record saying that Hillary Clinton is the war on women.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:33.784]  She says she is going to hound her and dog her with what her husband did and what she helped him get away with.
[00:31:33.884 --> 00:31:40.809]  So it's going to be very difficult for Hillary Clinton if she wins the nomination, because people like Roger Stone with his Rape PAC.
[00:31:41.449 --> 00:31:44.771]  And Donald Trump are not going to let her get away with it.
[00:31:44.791 --> 00:31:47.492]  Of course, people like Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush would.
[00:31:48.093 --> 00:31:48.993]  But it's not their fault.
[00:31:49.193 --> 00:31:50.334]  It's not Clinton's fault.
[00:31:50.494 --> 00:31:51.835]  You know, it's the staffer's fault.
[00:31:51.915 --> 00:31:52.695]  It's the media's fault.
[00:31:52.735 --> 00:31:57.358]  It's everyone else's fault that they have decades of a trail of scandals behind the two of them.
[00:31:57.918 --> 00:32:03.181]  But, you know, of course, it's interesting watching the gloves coming off between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.
[00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:07.183]  And, you know, even Bill Clinton's coming out saying that the Bernie Sanders
[00:32:14.431 --> 00:32:15.012]  Good grief!
[00:32:15.292 --> 00:32:17.375]  We're getting offended by everything these days.
[00:32:17.455 --> 00:32:19.958]  People can't say anything without offending somebody.
[00:32:19.978 --> 00:32:23.102]  So, she can dish it out, but she can't take it.
[00:32:23.503 --> 00:32:29.251]  Yeah, she says that, uh, I thought it was interesting, you know, when she says she's a victim of the most negative campaign in Democrat history.
[00:32:29.851 --> 00:32:34.714]  She claimed that Sanders was attacking her when he brags he doesn't benefit from a super PAC action committee.
[00:32:34.734 --> 00:32:40.477]  So I guess when Bernie implies that politicians are being bought, Hillary immediately assumes, you're talking about me!
[00:32:41.057 --> 00:32:42.318]  Because it's absolutely true.
[00:32:42.758 --> 00:32:50.542]  Well stay with us, we're going to come back with some clips from today's radio program where we talk to our reporter Richard Reeves as well as Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:32:50.582 --> 00:32:51.523]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:33:14.893 --> 00:33:17.355]  This is Bernie Sanders and I'm quite upset.
[00:33:17.555 --> 00:33:24.298]  If you guys saw the Iowa Caucus the other night, you would know that I worked extremely hard for these votes.
[00:33:24.598 --> 00:33:30.761]  And the people that were working in the Iowa Caucus took what I worked hard for and gave it to someone else.
[00:33:31.081 --> 00:33:36.063]  A lying, cheating, horrible human being by the name of Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:38.244 --> 00:33:42.146]  I don't understand how anybody could like something like this.
[00:33:42.226 --> 00:33:54.492]  That you work hard for something your whole life and you earn something and then you're expected to give it to someone else who's not as deserving and is too lazy or more of a piece of crap than you are.
[00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:57.613]  What kind of person would even think about something like that?
[00:33:57.873 --> 00:34:01.235]  Hey, that'd be you, Bernie Sanders.
[00:34:01.475 --> 00:34:02.536]  Guess you just felt the Bern.
[00:34:03.656 --> 00:34:06.657]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:06.858 --> 00:34:07.478]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.301]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:34:14.641 --> 00:34:18.184]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:34:18.444 --> 00:34:21.067]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:34:21.387 --> 00:34:24.830]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.734]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts.
[00:34:28.854 --> 00:34:29.174]  I'm good.
[00:34:53.069 --> 00:34:54.110]  We're good to go.
[00:35:12.617 --> 00:35:18.719]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential forfeiture situation?
[00:35:18.759 --> 00:35:20.020]  The police are shoving people.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:20.860]  Shoving Alex.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.041]  Shoving the crowd.
[00:35:22.061 --> 00:35:22.881]  Here we go, folks.
[00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:23.801]  I'm being assaulted.
[00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:30.104]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:35:30.204 --> 00:35:36.106]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the streets?
[00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:40.028]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:43.169]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:51.292]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:35:51.573 --> 00:35:53.613]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:35:53.673 --> 00:35:54.714]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:35:55.054 --> 00:36:03.822]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:36:12.487 --> 00:36:21.773]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[00:36:21.973 --> 00:36:26.577]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[00:36:26.677 --> 00:36:31.100]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.362]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[00:36:34.502 --> 00:36:36.603]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[00:36:36.843 --> 00:36:39.505]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[00:37:04.326 --> 00:37:18.929]  With Rand Paul out of the race, who will oppose things like the militarized police state, like the surveillance state, warrantless searches, or the confiscation of our property without being charged with a crime, civil asset forfeiture, the war on drugs?
[00:37:18.989 --> 00:37:27.850]  No, without Rand Paul in, there's not anybody with the Democrats or the Republicans where there's a dime's worth of difference on the issue of individual liberty.
[00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:31.991]  However, there still remains a choice when it comes to foreign policy.
[00:37:32.651 --> 00:37:38.375]  Donald Trump may be our only hope to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Trans-Atlantic Partnerships.
[00:37:38.455 --> 00:37:41.177]  That's why the establishment hates him so much.
[00:37:41.537 --> 00:37:44.359]  He stands in the way of their global trade deals.
[00:37:44.759 --> 00:37:49.842]  And I think it's interesting to look at this story from Politico back at the end of January, January the 20th.
[00:37:50.102 --> 00:37:53.385]  They talk about Trump's 19th century foreign policy.
[00:37:53.845 --> 00:37:57.127]  They point out that his views are not as confused as they seem.
[00:37:57.167 --> 00:38:00.309]  In fact, they're remarkably consistent and they have a long history.
[00:38:00.689 --> 00:38:01.430]  That's very important.
[00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:06.976]  Can we believe that he is going to give us the kind of opposition that we want to the TPP?
[00:38:07.237 --> 00:38:16.848]  They say it's easy to poke fun at many of his foreign policy notions, but many of these views would have found favor in pre-World War II, even in some cases in 19th century America.
[00:38:17.308 --> 00:38:22.550]  Understand that this article on Politico is written by Thomas Wright, who's with the Brookings Institute.
[00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:28.771]  He opposes Donald Trump's foreign policy, and yet he points out how consistent it has been.
[00:38:29.112 --> 00:38:32.232]  And I think he does a really good job of laying out its parameters.
[00:38:32.272 --> 00:38:32.913]  Here's what he says.
[00:38:32.973 --> 00:38:37.434]  In sum, Trump believes that America gets a raw deal from the liberal international order.
[00:38:37.894 --> 00:38:42.355]  The New World Order, in other words, that it helped to create and has led since World War II.
[00:38:42.375 --> 00:38:46.897]  He has three key arguments that he returns to time and again over the past 30 years.
[00:38:47.397 --> 00:38:50.098]  He's deeply unhappy with America's military alliances.
[00:38:50.418 --> 00:38:52.878]  He feels the United States is over-committed around the world.
[00:38:53.178 --> 00:38:55.999]  He feels that America is disadvantaged by the global economy.
[00:38:56.279 --> 00:38:58.340]  And he's sympathetic to authoritarian strongmen.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.101]  I would say, not sympathetic, but he's not belligerent.
[00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:10.547]  Like these other idiots in the Democrat and Republican Party who want to pick a fight with authoritarian strongmen all over the world.
[00:39:10.787 --> 00:39:13.168]  And he points out Trump has been airing such views on U.S.
[00:39:13.188 --> 00:39:14.429]  foreign policy for some time.
[00:39:14.669 --> 00:39:22.975]  He even spent $100,000 on a full-page ad in the New York Times in 1987 that had a message remarkably similar to what he's saying today.
[00:39:22.995 --> 00:39:24.036]  In other words, for 30 years.
[00:39:24.636 --> 00:39:33.298]  He's been saying this 30 years ago, when he wasn't running for president, he paid $100,000 to take out an ad to talk about what he is so passionate about.
[00:39:33.638 --> 00:39:34.778]  And this is what he goes on to say.
[00:39:35.138 --> 00:39:46.221]  There are particular echoes of Senator Robert Taft, who unsuccessfully ran for the Republican nomination in 1940, 48 and 52, was widely seen as a leader of the conservative wing of the Republican Party.
[00:39:46.561 --> 00:39:48.502]  Taft was a staunch isolationist.
[00:39:48.742 --> 00:39:49.822]  So to the people who say,
[00:39:50.362 --> 00:39:52.224]  That Donald Trump isn't a conservative.
[00:39:52.524 --> 00:40:00.512]  You could say that his policies of America First are more conservative than the policies that we see from the rest of the GOP.
[00:40:00.893 --> 00:40:07.940]  He goes on to say, in a lengthy interview with Playboy Magazine in 1990, Trump was asked, what would President Trump's foreign policy be like?
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.261]  And he answered, he would believe very strongly in extreme military strength.
[00:40:11.501 --> 00:40:12.441]  He wouldn't trust anyone.
[00:40:12.661 --> 00:40:13.641]  He wouldn't trust the Russians.
[00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:14.721]  He wouldn't trust our allies.
[00:40:14.921 --> 00:40:16.421]  He'd have a huge military arsenal.
[00:40:16.441 --> 00:40:17.802]  He'd perfect it, understand it.
[00:40:18.122 --> 00:40:22.523]  Part of the problem, he said, is that we're defending some of the wealthiest countries in the world for nothing.
[00:40:22.783 --> 00:40:25.603]  We're being laughed at around the world because we defend Japan.
[00:40:26.063 --> 00:40:30.744]  And he talks about how it's not only Japan, but he says he would undo the 1960 U.S.-Japan Treaty.
[00:40:30.984 --> 00:40:35.965]  If somebody attacks Japan, he says, we have to immediately go and start World War III, okay?
[00:40:36.545 --> 00:40:38.447]  If we get attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us?
[00:40:38.607 --> 00:40:40.989]  How does that sound like a fair deal?
[00:40:41.009 --> 00:40:41.730]  Does that sound good?
[00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:48.876]  It goes on to point out in 2013, he had said, how long will we go on defending South Korea from North Korea without payment?
[00:40:49.257 --> 00:40:50.798]  When will they start to pay us?
[00:40:51.139 --> 00:40:54.241]  In other words, we've been suckers for the New World Order.
[00:40:54.342 --> 00:40:57.885]  We've been suckers for the globalists who run these multinational corporations.
[00:40:57.985 --> 00:41:02.109]  And the biggest part of that sucker deal is the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:41:02.549 --> 00:41:08.537]  Richard Reeves got up with Donald Trump's policy expert in this area and had this to say in an exclusive interview.
[00:41:10.058 --> 00:41:13.703]  Richard Reeves with Infowars.com at the Red Arrow Diner with Steve Miller.
[00:41:14.204 --> 00:41:15.826]  What's your position with the Trump campaign again?
[00:41:16.206 --> 00:41:17.488]  I'm the senior policy advisor.
[00:41:18.288 --> 00:41:22.773]  So, as Senior Policy Advisor, what are the top issues that you're working on?
[00:41:23.073 --> 00:41:25.115]  Well, two of the biggest ones are trade and immigration.
[00:41:25.455 --> 00:41:27.097]  And that's a lot of what this election comes down to.
[00:41:27.117 --> 00:41:36.066]  And of course, Alex Jones and Infowars have been on top of this for a long time, both on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and on the immigration issue and all the different facets of it.
[00:41:36.486 --> 00:41:37.968]  So it's really great to be talking to you today.
[00:41:38.548 --> 00:41:49.855]  But my short message for your audience would be that if you want to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, if you want to close the border, if you want to protect American jobs and wages, then you have to support Donald J. Trump.
[00:41:49.915 --> 00:41:56.179]  He's the only person who's been clear and consistent and firm on these issues and who isn't relying on large special interests and donors.
[00:41:56.909 --> 00:42:05.631]  Well, he clearly does appear to be the most serious candidate on that issue, and he's, uh, I'm convinced that he will actually get Mexico to even pay for the wall as well, right?
[00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:06.831]  There's no doubt that he will.
[00:42:07.111 --> 00:42:10.752]  He's a businessman, he knows how to get stuff done, and the reality is that we have all the leverage with Mexico.
[00:42:11.192 --> 00:42:18.073]  They send billions of dollars home every year in what are called remittances, right, which is that illegal immigrants make money here and they send it back home.
[00:42:18.113 --> 00:42:19.333]  Mexico's economy depends on it.
[00:42:19.754 --> 00:42:21.574]  Mexico's economy depends upon
[00:42:22.466 --> 00:42:23.667]  We're good to go.
[00:42:44.932 --> 00:42:45.112]  Right.
[00:42:45.192 --> 00:42:48.514]  And then add to that the cost of American jobs.
[00:42:49.235 --> 00:42:52.537]  Americans don't get the jobs that they should for the pay that they should.
[00:42:52.557 --> 00:42:52.897]  Right.
[00:42:52.957 --> 00:43:07.007]  And so the flip side of this, of course, is that while Mexico is making all the money off of the outsourced jobs, making money off of the remittance payments from the illegal alien workers, making money off of the guest worker programs and everything else, American workers are losing out.
[00:43:07.507 --> 00:43:09.568]  And that's why we have seen no wage growth.
[00:43:09.629 --> 00:43:10.889]  In fact, we've seen wage declines.
[00:43:10.929 --> 00:43:13.631]  That's why we've seen huge numbers of people not working at all.
[00:43:13.671 --> 00:43:14.752]  Look at the construction industry.
[00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:19.415]  How many construction workers across America right now are unemployed or have given up on construction altogether?
[00:43:20.255 --> 00:43:28.060]  Our open border has betrayed American workers in many industries and construction of course is one of the hardest hit and Donald J. Trump is going to turn that around.
[00:43:29.031 --> 00:43:30.853]  Now, you mentioned TPP a little while ago.
[00:43:31.193 --> 00:43:38.000]  Is Mr. Trump fully aware of the ramifications of the passage of TPP that it would actually pretty much wipe out U.S.
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.623]  sovereignty and open those floodgates to immigration?
[00:43:41.003 --> 00:43:43.426]  Yeah, so that's one of the things that he's been clearest on.
[00:43:43.706 --> 00:43:50.813]  And again, if you look at the way we've had eight debates now, I think, and has anyone else in any of the debates besides Mr. Trump
[00:43:51.454 --> 00:43:58.040]  He laid out a clear trade policy, and specifically, as he did in the last debate, opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.522]  The answer is it's only been Mr. Trump.
[00:44:00.922 --> 00:44:02.884]  And so if you want to protect U.S.
[00:44:02.924 --> 00:44:06.007]  sovereignty, then you need to vote for Donald J. Trump.
[00:44:06.067 --> 00:44:18.938]  And I'm confident that millions of patriotic Americans all across this country who care about their jobs and wages are thrilled by the fact that we have a candidate and a businessman who's going to stand up for American workers on the TPP.
[00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:28.137]  All right, well, now, what did you think about the debate last Saturday with the way the audience was kind of rigged in favor of the governors?
[00:44:28.157 --> 00:44:28.877]  What do you think about that?
[00:44:29.218 --> 00:44:34.022]  Well, I think it was, again, one of the reasons why people love Mr. Trump is that he tells the truth.
[00:44:34.502 --> 00:44:35.623]  He tells the truth.
[00:44:35.923 --> 00:44:44.671]  I'm sure all of us have watched these debates and wondered why sometimes the audiences seem to applaud for things that, you know, you would think that your typical blue-collar worker wouldn't applaud for.
[00:44:45.231 --> 00:44:48.874]  Or to jeer things that you think your typical blue-collar worker wouldn't jeer.
[00:44:49.014 --> 00:44:57.481]  There doesn't seem to be sort of a mismatch between audience reactions sometimes and how your typical Republican voter earning a working-class wage might react.
[00:44:57.962 --> 00:44:59.903]  And Donald Trump basically pulled back the curtain.
[00:44:59.943 --> 00:45:05.048]  He explained that, you know, our campaign gets 20 tickets and that most of the tickets are going to donors of special interest.
[00:45:05.348 --> 00:45:08.390]  And you talk to people, everyday Republican voters, they can't get tickets to these things.
[00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:08.691]  Think about it.
[00:45:08.711 --> 00:45:10.292]  When's the last time you were offered a ticket to a debate?
[00:45:10.751 --> 00:45:15.674]  Well, and it's a great thing he called out the audience because that was actually probably a winning moment in the debate right there.
[00:45:15.934 --> 00:45:18.255]  Right, because most Americans aren't large donors.
[00:45:18.676 --> 00:45:26.520]  That's the whole point, is Mr. Trump is appealing to, as he will in a general election, people who don't have large check accounts to write checks to politicians.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.301]  He's appealing to people who go to work every day for a living.
[00:45:30.049 --> 00:45:40.997]  The GOP, in my estimation, plans on, what they did to that debate, that's what they plan on doing in Cleveland in July, is stacking that delegation full of GOP hardline establishment folks.
[00:45:41.414 --> 00:46:02.506]  The easiest thing to do if we want to have Donald J. Trump be our nominee is to show up and vote tomorrow in New Hampshire and then to vote in South Carolina and all across this country and that will guarantee, I assure you, that Donald J. Trump will be the Republican nominee and millions and millions of people are joining this movement and is going to truly make America great again.
[00:46:03.307 --> 00:46:07.789]  And beyond that folks, get to your precinct conventions and precinct coxes because that's the road to Cleveland.
[00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:09.290]  Steve Miller, thank you so much.
[00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:10.451]  Thank you, great to be here.
[00:46:11.704 --> 00:46:20.850]  As we saw earlier, Marco Rubio tells us that Obama is deliberately destroying the country, yet he wants to give him authority to push through the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:46:21.291 --> 00:46:28.676]  Jeb Bush criticizes Donald Trump for private use of eminent domain, and yet the Bushes have done the same thing here in Texas for a baseball team.
[00:46:29.056 --> 00:46:33.019]  That's the hypocrisy that we see in the Republican Party and the Democrat Party.
[00:46:33.459 --> 00:46:34.760]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:47:03.004 --> 00:47:04.024]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.544 --> 00:47:06.845]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.105 --> 00:47:14.967]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.468]  We're good.
[00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:08.253]  If anyone's going to hell, it's Madeleine Albright.
[00:49:08.753 --> 00:49:20.947]  Now she's caused controversy over comments she made during a Clinton campaign rally on Saturday when she said there's a special place reserved in hell for women who don't vote for Hillary Clinton.
[00:49:20.987 --> 00:49:21.608]  Here's the clip.
[00:49:22.816 --> 00:49:25.318]  We can tell our story about how we climbed the ladder.
[00:49:25.378 --> 00:49:29.561]  And a lot of you younger women don't think you have to... It's been done.
[00:49:29.721 --> 00:49:31.162]  It's not done.
[00:49:31.502 --> 00:49:32.643]  And you have to help.
[00:49:33.043 --> 00:49:35.665]  Hillary Clinton will always be there for you.
[00:49:36.285 --> 00:49:41.429]  And just remember, there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other.
[00:49:43.345 --> 00:49:52.416]  That was former Secretary of State and UN Ambassador Madeleine Albright saying there's a special place reserved in hell for young women who don't vote for Hillary Clinton.
[00:49:52.977 --> 00:49:58.103]  Again, suggesting that they will go to hell, literally they will go to hell if they don't vote for Hillary.
[00:49:58.664 --> 00:50:06.153]  Now of course there are two facets to this, one of which is Hillary Clinton has got basically no platform whatsoever.
[00:50:06.553 --> 00:50:09.056]  She's running on name recognition alone.
[00:50:09.537 --> 00:50:11.559]  She's completely collapsed in the polls.
[00:50:11.619 --> 00:50:15.143]  At one point she had a two-to-one lead over Bernie Sanders.
[00:50:15.764 --> 00:50:18.907]  Again, not venerating that anything, you know, Sanders stands for.
[00:50:19.528 --> 00:50:21.229]  But she was the establishment pick.
[00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:25.811]  We pointed that out during Bilderberg last year in Austria, that all the big money was behind her.
[00:50:26.271 --> 00:50:27.632]  The decision had been made.
[00:50:28.092 --> 00:50:30.894]  She stepped down for Obama back in 2008.
[00:50:31.254 --> 00:50:34.736]  But this time around, the elite were behind Hillary.
[00:50:35.456 --> 00:50:36.697]  But she has no platform.
[00:50:36.717 --> 00:50:44.081]  The only platform she's got is, I'm a feminist, I stand for women, I have a vagina, you have a vagina, vote for me.
[00:50:44.621 --> 00:50:52.026]  Of course that's insidiously ironic because of the revelations we've had on this show from Roger Stone where basically
[00:50:52.606 --> 00:50:58.432]  Hillary has hired people to terrorize Bill Clinton's alleged rape victims.
[00:50:58.752 --> 00:51:01.835]  Those are her, quote, feminist credentials.
[00:51:02.375 --> 00:51:09.402]  So again, Madeleine Albright basically gets up and says, you have to vote for Hillary because she has a vagina, you have a vagina, and that's it.
[00:51:09.862 --> 00:51:11.744]  That's the sum of her campaign.
[00:51:12.565 --> 00:51:15.027]  And you're going to hell if you don't.
[00:51:15.828 --> 00:51:29.878]  Now, those are quite rich words coming from Madeleine Albright, but I think we should take them seriously, because she should be treated as quite the authority on who is going to hell, given that she likely has a one-way ticket.
[00:51:29.898 --> 00:51:37.204]  And the reason I say that is because of these, again, absolutely astounding remarks that we've covered time and time again, but they're evergreen.
[00:51:37.864 --> 00:51:39.465]  During an interview with 60 Minutes,
[00:51:41.587 --> 00:51:55.258]  In 1996, Albright, who was then ambassador to the United Nations, infamously suggested that half a million dead Iraqi children, due to UN sanctions, was a price worth paying.
[00:51:55.318 --> 00:51:56.859]  Here's the clip from 60 Minutes.
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.782]  We have heard that half a million children have died.
[00:52:00.802 --> 00:52:05.926]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[00:52:06.686 --> 00:52:09.849]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[00:52:10.859 --> 00:52:15.371]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[00:52:17.554 --> 00:52:24.921]  That's Madeleine Albright back in 96 saying the price of half a million dead Iraqi children is quote, worth it.
[00:52:24.981 --> 00:52:38.773]  So again, she was saying basically the sanctions that had killed that amount of children in Iraq at the time being carried out by the UN with US support, that geopolitical motive justified the mass slaughter of children.
[00:52:39.253 --> 00:52:41.516]  Somebody who lines up behind that kind of
[00:52:42.116 --> 00:52:48.818]  Bloodthirsty belief, I would venture, has a pretty good grasp on whether she's going to hell or not.
[00:52:49.398 --> 00:52:59.162]  So now she's lecturing other people about having a special place reserved in Hades, I'm sure Madeleine Albright, given her history, will be joining them.
[00:52:59.182 --> 00:52:59.622]  And of course,
[00:53:00.402 --> 00:53:10.568]  After that interview, she kind of backtracked and said, oh, I didn't really mean it, but still barbed Leslie Stahl, the interviewer there, and said she was an Iraqi propagandist.
[00:53:11.008 --> 00:53:13.929]  So again, she never really backed away from those comments.
[00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:17.631]  They were absolutely disgusting at the time, and they still are.
[00:53:18.432 --> 00:53:23.615]  So for her to lecture other people on where their soul's going to end up is pretty rich indeed.
[00:53:24.515 --> 00:53:25.997]  But we got Richard Reeves on the line.
[00:53:26.037 --> 00:53:34.988]  We're first going to go to a couple of videos because obviously Richard has been down there on the ground in Iowa, in New Hampshire for InfoWars over the past two or three weeks.
[00:53:35.649 --> 00:53:41.596]  First up, if you didn't see this, this is where Richard confronts Marco Rubio on the TPP.
[00:53:41.636 --> 00:53:42.337]  Let's take a look.
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:53.932]  It is more important than ever that Congress give the President trade promotion authority so that he can finalize the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
[00:53:55.289 --> 00:54:01.052]  Senator Rubio, last year you spoke at a Council on Foreign Relations meeting, and you were a big proponent of the TPP.
[00:54:01.652 --> 00:54:04.994]  And I was just wondering, the TPP diminishes our U.S.
[00:54:05.014 --> 00:54:07.815]  sovereignty and also potentially destroys our borders.
[00:54:07.835 --> 00:54:08.415]  Well, I'm a supporter.
[00:54:08.435 --> 00:54:09.716]  No, I'm a supporter of free trade.
[00:54:10.356 --> 00:54:11.837]  I have to see if this deal is a good deal.
[00:54:11.937 --> 00:54:13.998]  It's being reviewed now by the International Trade Commission.
[00:54:14.318 --> 00:54:15.539]  So if it's a good deal, I'll support it.
[00:54:15.559 --> 00:54:17.080]  If it's not, it has to be renegotiated.
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:18.480]  Well, at what point does it get seen?
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:19.741]  Because it's been kept secret.
[00:54:19.901 --> 00:54:20.501]  No, it's out there.
[00:54:20.521 --> 00:54:22.342]  The International Trade Commission is reviewing it.
[00:54:22.382 --> 00:54:23.542]  They'll issue their report in May.
[00:54:23.623 --> 00:54:26.083]  So until then, I'm not even going to take a position on it.
[00:54:26.103 --> 00:54:26.764]  It's 5,000 pages.
[00:54:26.864 --> 00:54:28.004]  So it's very dense.
[00:54:28.044 --> 00:54:28.925]  Right, it's 5,000 pages.
[00:54:29.505 --> 00:54:32.386]  So have you been able to read all 5,000 pages?
[00:54:32.406 --> 00:54:40.969]  No, and I'm not going to even try until the International Trade Commission comes back and finds that it's not good for America or I'll have to go back and renegotiate.
[00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:43.430]  Sir, we've got a bunch of people waiting, so if you don't mind.
[00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:44.331]  Thank you, appreciate it.
[00:54:45.211 --> 00:54:49.192]  Well, what about his past support of the TPP, which could endanger U.S.
[00:54:49.232 --> 00:54:51.613]  sovereignty and open up the floodgates of immigration?
[00:54:51.633 --> 00:54:52.374]  What about that?
[00:54:52.414 --> 00:54:54.054]  Well, I don't think he's voted on TPP.
[00:54:54.134 --> 00:54:59.456]  He voted on TPA, which allows us to consider TPP, but we haven't voted on TPP yet.
[00:54:59.576 --> 00:55:03.257]  He also spoke at the Council on Foreign Relations and was a big proponent of it there.
[00:55:05.908 --> 00:55:09.269]  I can't speak to that because I wasn't there.
[00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:14.752]  If you can find a candidate that's perfect, let me know because there's only been one and he ain't running.
[00:55:14.812 --> 00:55:15.112]  Thank you.
[00:55:15.212 --> 00:55:15.672]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:18.453 --> 00:55:23.735]  There's Richard Reeves talking to Marco Rubio about the TPP, exposing his hypocrisy on that.
[00:55:24.456 --> 00:55:29.298]  Reeves also got the chance to ask Hillary Clinton a question about the email hack.
[00:55:29.398 --> 00:55:30.238]  Here's that clip.
[00:55:31.254 --> 00:55:38.925]  Secretary Clinton, last week it was reported on InfoWars.com that your email server was hacked and you knowingly continued to use your email server.
[00:55:39.186 --> 00:55:40.047]  Can you comment on that?
[00:55:40.207 --> 00:55:41.188]  Yeah, it's totally untrue.
[00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:43.231]  Totally untrue.
[00:55:43.672 --> 00:55:44.493]  Okay, here we go.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:53.347]  Again, there's Richard Reeves asking Hillary Clinton about the email hack and we're joined by Richard Reeves from New Hampshire.
[00:55:53.987 --> 00:55:56.209]  Richard, you've been on the ground there for Infowars.
[00:55:56.530 --> 00:56:02.456]  We've got the polls telling us that it's going to be a 1-2 win for Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.
[00:56:03.036 --> 00:56:06.480]  A quite comfortable margin looking at the current figures.
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:09.362]  The GOP establishment is now framing it
[00:56:10.299 --> 00:56:13.322]  If Trump only wins by 12 points, he's lost.
[00:56:14.042 --> 00:56:16.925]  So what are you seeing down there on the ground in New Hampshire?
[00:56:16.945 --> 00:56:17.665]  What can you tell us?
[00:56:19.046 --> 00:56:29.755]  Well, Paul, thank you, and we can only hope that the polls are actually correct because they're really in danger of losing a lot of credibility on these polls if they don't match what they're coming up with as far as these numbers.
[00:56:31.494 --> 00:56:34.897]  Here, on the ground, the sense is that the polls are correct.
[00:56:35.938 --> 00:56:55.574]  We've had, you know, Marco Rubio, you played that clip just a little while ago, so he hasn't really been attacked on the TPP yet, although Donald Trump did foreshadow talking about TPP more in this past debate, whereas I'm sure most of our audience already knows that the audience was stacked totally in favor of the GOP establishment.
[00:56:55.654 --> 00:56:58.036]  So, here, boots on the ground.
[00:56:58.096 --> 00:57:00.678]  The other candidates to watch, I actually see Marco Rubio here.
[00:57:01.418 --> 00:57:11.541]  Is probably in danger of falling fourth or fifth place because of the fact that you've got Kasich and Chris Christie have done a lot of groundwork.
[00:57:11.801 --> 00:57:28.485]  We did go to a Kasich event yesterday and he had an event that almost paralleled Marco Rubio's Friday night event and considering he's done a hundred town halls, Kasich has done a hundred town halls, I think that potentially you could see Trump followed by
[00:57:29.405 --> 00:57:39.873]  Uh, a combination of Cruz, Kasich, Christie, Rubio, somehow in that order with, uh, I think it'll obviously, it should be Donald Trump on top.
[00:57:40.353 --> 00:57:45.997]  And I think he really won the debate the other day when he exposed the fact that that crowd was a bunch of insiders.
[00:57:47.694 --> 00:57:53.639]  Well yeah, obviously he said they were put there to cheer his opponents in the debate, and that's exactly what seemed to unfold.
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:58:03.288]  But with Rubio, they've been saying for quite a few days now, you know, after this bronze finish in Iowa, which was heralded by the establishment as a huge success,
[00:58:03.888 --> 00:58:20.381]  They were saying he was on course to beat Bosch and Kasich in New Hampshire and that he needed to do so to propel himself as the number one, quote, establishment candidate, which would then see him emerge as a direct competitor with Cruz and Trump.
[00:58:20.962 --> 00:58:27.487]  So if, you know, if Rubio doesn't beat Bosch and Kasich, do you think that that is his campaign basically over?
[00:58:29.056 --> 00:58:30.657]  Well, that's it for tonight's nightly news.
