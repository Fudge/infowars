[00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.684]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:23.087]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.107 --> 00:00:25.051]  It is May 19th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:33.167]  Tonight, has ISIS struck again?
[00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:42.552]  Egypt Air Flight 804 goes down after French intelligence warned authorities it was clearly being targeted by terrorists.
[00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:48.135]  Then, the California Senate approves sweeping gun control measures.
[00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:53.597]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton campaigns to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:58.440]  And the Second Amendment was written to guarantee that that will never happen.
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.743]  And Pope Francis says Jesus is like ISIS.
[00:01:04.344 --> 00:01:07.966]  And he says Muslims must breed with Europeans.
[00:01:08.487 --> 00:01:10.208]  Can you say Antichrist?
[00:01:10.608 --> 00:01:14.631]  All that plus much more up next on the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:20.375]  To say we're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down.
[00:01:20.695 --> 00:01:22.837]  If you want them, come and take them!
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:04.596]  Bringing you news on an ongoing story.
[00:03:04.757 --> 00:03:08.687]  Egypt Air Flight 804 has been found, albeit in wreckage.
[00:03:09.378 --> 00:03:21.647]  Earlier today, we know the vice chairman of Egypt Air told CNN that the wreckage from Egypt Air 804 had been found about 150 nautical miles north of the Egyptian coast.
[00:03:21.727 --> 00:03:25.430]  Now this breaking news, Greek officials say it is not.
[00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.472]  I repeat, it is not the wreckage of the plane.
[00:03:28.512 --> 00:03:34.036]  So at this point, wreckage from Egyptian Air Flight 804 has not been discovered.
[00:03:34.076 --> 00:03:35.297]  The search continues.
[00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.941]  And we'll bring you more on that as it develops.
[00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:39.982]  Now, let's talk about something different here.
[00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:48.148]  When we talk about somebody like the Pope, I always try to be respectful, but some of the things that even top guys like him can say just rub me the wrong way.
[00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:54.573]  One was last year when he said that by human standards, Jesus's life was a failure.
[00:03:54.913 --> 00:04:00.434]  Now, I'm willing to give the guy a benefit of a doubt and say he had some greater meaning behind that than maybe was lost on me.
[00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:04.035]  But some other things he says I just cannot get with at all.
[00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:10.537]  And we have this article, Pope Francis likens Jesus to ISIS and says Muslims must breed with Europeans.
[00:04:10.937 --> 00:04:17.659]  Now, I'm going to read you this quote and then you can make up your own mind whether you think this criticism is justified or not.
[00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:27.534]  Today, I don't think that there's a fear of Islam as such, but of ISIS and its war of conquest, which is partly drawn from Islam.
[00:04:27.614 --> 00:04:29.435]  Now, to that, I would agree with that.
[00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:39.284]  I think a lot of people, when they see these Muslim terrorist events, these guys screaming Allah Akbar before they set off a suicide bomb or commence a shooting,
[00:04:39.804 --> 00:04:40.864]  That's your radical group.
[00:04:40.884 --> 00:04:46.506]  That's ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, you know, Boko Haram kidnapping all the schoolgirls over there in Africa.
[00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:51.488]  So people see these things and they are being affected by these groups, not Islam itself.
[00:04:51.908 --> 00:04:52.468]  We'll continue here.
[00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:54.569]  This is what he said to a French newspaper.
[00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.271]  It is true that the idea of conquest is inherent to the soul of Islam.
[00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:10.419]  However, it is also possible to interpret the objective of Matthew's Gospel, where Jesus sends his disciples to all the nations in terms of the same idea of conquest.
[00:05:10.739 --> 00:05:12.200]  Now, this is where I take exception.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.844]  Yes, Jesus did send his followers out, but he didn't send them out on a radical jihad.
[00:05:16.864 --> 00:05:19.806]  He didn't say, kill people who do not convert to your way.
[00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:21.466]  I don't know.
[00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:45.047]  Issue here that maybe isn't accurately captured in the soundbite, but the soundbite itself I take much exception to.
[00:05:45.147 --> 00:05:48.169]  Jesus did not go out and tell people to commit some violence.
[00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:50.450]  Yes, he did, you know, beat the money changers and stuff like that.
[00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.032]  He did tell his followers to go out and buy swords for, you know, personal defense and protection.
[00:05:55.312 --> 00:05:58.014]  But he didn't say go out and commit violence against anybody.
[00:05:58.074 --> 00:06:02.436]  So let me be very clear to anybody who thinks that what he just said was gospel there.
[00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:09.644]  Now let's talk about something that we've been talking about for many years now, but you can finally believe it because it's being reported on mainstream outlets.
[00:06:09.964 --> 00:06:13.969]  That is the issue of people spying on you in your own home through your own electronics.
[00:06:14.884 --> 00:06:28.768]  Now, I started here coming up close to four years ago, and the idea that somebody was spying on you was just kooky, tinfoil hat, everything is invulnerable, nobody, even if they could, why would anybody want to look at you?
[00:06:29.268 --> 00:06:30.149]  Because they can.
[00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:34.810]  That's why people do anything because they can or they feel they can get away with it.
[00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:41.312]  This goes for your smartphones, your tablets, whatever you have, your smart TVs, and I remember
[00:06:42.012 --> 00:07:05.698]  I believe it was CNN, two or three years ago, they put out the article, or it was actually a video, the correspondent there, she was talking to some security expert, privacy expert, whoever the guy was, and he was saying, yeah, this is how you hack in, and he just went in and hacked the TV in real time and showed them, yeah, this is, I could be at my house looking at you on your TV, and the lady was aghast, and she got a piece of scotch tape or whatever tape, and she put it over the top, and she said, yeah, I would recommend that you do this too.
[00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:06.618]  That was a couple years ago.
[00:07:06.978 --> 00:07:08.199]  Alex Jones has been talking about this for,
[00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:12.760]  Many years before I even got here, but let's take a look at one of the latest stories.
[00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:17.490]  The trolls who take photos of you through your TV and turn it into porn.
[00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:23.767]  They say some images are lifted from social media sites or even from smart TVs.
[00:07:23.807 --> 00:07:24.608]  That's what I was just saying.
[00:07:24.708 --> 00:07:29.910]  The smart TVs are then manipulated and photoshopped to make them appear pornographic.
[00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.272]  Now, once again, this isn't inherent to smart TVs or hackable devices.
[00:07:34.572 --> 00:07:38.554]  Some people just take your images and want to turn them into porn for whatever reason.
[00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:43.356]  I'm not sure why somebody would want to do it, but I guess there is a market for it.
[00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:52.240]  If you're perusing the internet for that kind of deal, I guess you're not too interested in what's actually real or not, but just something to be aware of.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:59.544]  You know, the next time you have your TV out, just be aware that somebody can hack into your devices and use that information for their own personal means.
[00:07:59.984 --> 00:08:01.785]  Now let's talk about something that's near and dear to me.
[00:08:01.865 --> 00:08:08.629]  That is the Second Amendment of the United States of America, and I do believe shall not be infringed is an absolute.
[00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:18.172]  Now it doesn't say shout out being friends if you hunt or if you just shoot at the gun range as many people want to add their own spin and emphasis on it.
[00:08:18.912 --> 00:08:27.415]  Because you see all these politicians, these constitutional scholars, lawyers as they call themselves, they say they know what's in the Constitution so they know how to abide by it.
[00:08:27.795 --> 00:08:30.896]  I say they know what's in the Constitution so they know their willfully
[00:08:32.257 --> 00:08:40.782]  Bastardizing it when they add all these changes to it or their own interpretations where they say that you can't have more than 10 bullets in your magazine.
[00:08:41.302 --> 00:08:44.564]  You can't have an easily detachable magazine, which I'm like, wow, that's an issue now.
[00:08:45.205 --> 00:08:49.588]  You can't have a cosmetic feature on your gun like a buttstock if you live in the state of New York.
[00:08:49.928 --> 00:08:51.949]  And this is how ridiculous the argument is.
[00:08:52.129 --> 00:08:55.992]  You guys may recall a couple years ago, I went down to South by Southwest where you're having
[00:08:56.472 --> 00:08:58.072]  A open carry march down there.
[00:08:58.092 --> 00:08:59.373]  Lo and behold, nobody got shot.
[00:08:59.393 --> 00:09:00.033]  I mean, who would have thought?
[00:09:00.053 --> 00:09:01.793]  You know, a bunch of guys walking around guns and nobody got shot.
[00:09:03.233 --> 00:09:05.454]  And there's a gentleman there, and he was a polite guy.
[00:09:05.494 --> 00:09:06.654]  He was willing to engage me.
[00:09:06.694 --> 00:09:08.895]  I do appreciate you for that, sir.
[00:09:09.435 --> 00:09:11.655]  But his issue was like, I don't like these guns.
[00:09:11.715 --> 00:09:15.096]  If you want to have a gun for self-defense, keep it in your closet at your house.
[00:09:15.156 --> 00:09:17.016]  But other than that, he didn't want people to be armed.
[00:09:17.036 --> 00:09:19.777]  This is my understanding, just going off my recollection here.
[00:09:21.195 --> 00:09:25.878]  And the issue with that is, is he would say, well, you guys keep saying everybody wants to take your guns.
[00:09:25.918 --> 00:09:28.480]  I'm like, well, no, number one, I'm not saying everybody wants to take your guns.
[00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:32.723]  Number two, if somebody tries to do something and fails, they still try.
[00:09:33.023 --> 00:09:42.110]  For example, if somebody breaks into your house and you know, they get caught by the cops running down the street with your TV, they fail to steal your TV, but they still attempted to steal it.
[00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.914]  And when I talk about people like Dianne Feinstein or various other characters in the gun grab
[00:09:49.409 --> 00:09:50.109]  Situation.
[00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:53.270]  They tried to pass stuff and failed spectacularly.
[00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:58.232]  Case in point, I'm talking about one Mrs. Dianne Feinstein who ties into California, which we'll get into one second here.
[00:09:58.712 --> 00:10:05.694]  But you guys may recall the piece we've shown innumerable times here on InfoWars.com of Mrs. Feinstein on 60 Minutes saying,
[00:10:06.514 --> 00:10:10.596]  If I had the power, if I had the votes, I would say, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:10:10.996 --> 00:10:17.438]  And this is the person who is leading the charge, or one of the people leading the charge, on gun regulations here in the United States of America.
[00:10:17.858 --> 00:10:25.781]  Notice she didn't say, you know, reasonable gun control, smart gun control, that we can all get behind, or whatever the buzz term is this week.
[00:10:26.002 --> 00:10:29.583]  She said, no, if I was president, if I was dictator in chief,
[00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:32.464]  I would take every gun from the United States of America.
[00:10:32.524 --> 00:10:34.864]  Now, you may say, hey, that's her personal opinion.
[00:10:34.944 --> 00:10:35.645]  And you would be right.
[00:10:35.765 --> 00:10:38.425]  Not everybody has that extreme of an opinion.
[00:10:38.445 --> 00:10:44.787]  But if you guys recall, after Sandy Hook, she was the person in charge of the new regulations under President Obama.
[00:10:45.007 --> 00:10:49.309]  Obama said, hey, I will sign whatever Dianne Feinstein puts in front of me.
[00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:51.689]  And once again, this is Feinstein being in charge.
[00:10:51.709 --> 00:10:57.331]  She had a whole long list of guns that would cease to exist in the United States of America if her laws got passed.
[00:10:57.711 --> 00:11:00.773]  Things as simple as AR-15s and AK-47s.
[00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:02.253]  Semi-automatic, mind you.
[00:11:02.353 --> 00:11:04.114]  Also some pump-action shotguns on there.
[00:11:05.095 --> 00:11:10.318]  Anybody would say, I don't understand, why do you want to have an AK-47 or AR-15?
[00:11:10.418 --> 00:11:16.181]  If you don't understand this, many of these laws are being written by people who don't even understand how a firearm works.
[00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:22.964]  They go watch a Stallone movie and they think you can shoot somebody in the leg from 500 yards with a .22 pistol and they explode into flames.
[00:11:23.304 --> 00:11:25.045]  It doesn't work like that in real life.
[00:11:26.926 --> 00:11:40.275]  So, when you have a semi-automatic firearm, if you have a big sporting goods store, I don't know what it is in your town, if you have a Kimbella's or a Bass Pro Shop Academy, which we have here in the South, those guns are not fully automatic.
[00:11:40.415 --> 00:11:44.098]  If you see an AR-15 or AK-47, that is not a fully automatic weapon.
[00:11:44.538 --> 00:11:45.359]  Well, you can augment it.
[00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:48.741]  Well, you can augment bath water into liquor if you're patient enough.
[00:11:48.761 --> 00:11:50.382]  You can augment anything to do anything.
[00:11:50.402 --> 00:11:52.424]  You can beat somebody to death with a phone book.
[00:11:53.044 --> 00:11:55.246]  But I've been talking a lot without even getting to the article.
[00:11:55.266 --> 00:11:57.428]  You guys, tell me what says in the article.
[00:11:57.468 --> 00:11:59.970]  California Senate approves sweeping gun control measures.
[00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:15.002]  It says, Lawmakers voted to require that people turn in magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds, as they approved nearly a dozen measures that would significantly reshape California's gun laws, already among the strictest in the U.S.
[00:12:15.583 --> 00:12:18.985]  Senators approved 11 gun-related bills in total.
[00:12:19.366 --> 00:12:24.129]  They include regulations for homemade firearms, background checks for ammunition purchases,
[00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:25.912]  We're good to go.
[00:12:38.396 --> 00:12:46.478]  This is my argument when people say, well, we should regulate or have a registry of people who have mass purchases of ammunition.
[00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:49.819]  You could have mass purchases of alcohol, for example.
[00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:51.419]  We go out and do all kinds of stupid stuff with that.
[00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:59.361]  But when I bring up that argument of it, people say, well, you can't ban alcohol because we had prohibition and we had violent crime spike overnight.
[00:12:59.381 --> 00:13:02.722]  Well, what do you think is going to happen if they actually come through and ban firearms?
[00:13:02.742 --> 00:13:04.682]  So that's my counterargument to that.
[00:13:04.822 --> 00:13:06.623]  Also, the 10 rounds in the magazine
[00:13:08.683 --> 00:13:36.376]  People need to understand, going back to my earlier statement of people watching the movies and stuff like that, there's an article, I think it was right after Feinstein was trying to come through with this most recent stuff, saying that she wanted to ban the number of bullets you can have in your magazine, and this woman, she had like a five or six shot revolver, she was home with her kids, somebody broke into her house, she shot five shots at the bad guy, I'm not sure if she hit him all five times, but she shot him multiple times, the guy ran out the house, lo and behold, he didn't die.
[00:13:36.756 --> 00:13:45.663]  If he was with a crew of two or three people, she would have been out of bullets and out of luck when the other guys came to harm her, but that's just one aspect from it.
[00:13:46.043 --> 00:13:52.228]  And also, when you talk about just banning things, people need to understand they don't talk about San Bernardino, Sandy Hook, and all these other things.
[00:13:52.268 --> 00:14:01.355]  And yes, those are true tragedies, but there's an article just the other day of a couple brothers, I believe they're twin brothers, they're going around town with homemade IEDs and blown up mailboxes.
[00:14:01.835 --> 00:14:05.436]  I mean, you can make a bomb with stuff you buy at Home Depot or Lowe's.
[00:14:05.496 --> 00:14:07.096]  Are you going to shut down Home Depot or Lowe's?
[00:14:07.517 --> 00:14:10.877]  No, you understand they're good, responsible people, just like they're bad people.
[00:14:10.897 --> 00:14:17.299]  When you find the bad people, you put them in jail or whatever sanctions you have to do on them, but you don't stress out the rest of the population.
[00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:23.901]  And speaking of stress, they're saying that the average person only has about 36 minutes a day to relax fully.
[00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:27.851]  And this is a report, it's a study of about 2,000 people.
[00:14:28.351 --> 00:14:31.233]  And they say, these people, they said they felt stressed.
[00:14:31.634 --> 00:14:39.439]  As many as 30% of those polled said that over the past six months, they have not been able to fully take a break from work and recharge.
[00:14:39.459 --> 00:14:41.220]  And they say this builds up a toll.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.121]  It takes a toll on you.
[00:14:42.461 --> 00:14:48.826]  And they say that you're more likely to have mistakes at work, other things, you know, take time off work, sick days, and all that other stuff.
[00:14:49.386 --> 00:14:52.468]  And let's say, you know, you're done with work, and you're done with school, whatever.
[00:14:52.849 --> 00:14:53.409]  What about this?
[00:14:53.429 --> 00:14:58.633]  You go to the gas station, and now you have crazy people attacking you at the gas station, as is this video.
[00:14:59.053 --> 00:15:01.355]  Woman caught on video taking a bat to a truck.
[00:15:01.615 --> 00:15:02.736]  I told you to move.
[00:15:02.976 --> 00:15:04.397]  Very stressed out indeed.
[00:15:04.417 --> 00:15:10.982]  It's not what you expect when you go get gas.
[00:15:11.022 --> 00:15:14.445]  The woman working there, counting down, and then this.
[00:15:21.707 --> 00:15:23.128]  I told you to move, she says.
[00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:26.692]  Apparently angry he's been sitting in front of the gas pump for too long.
[00:15:31.757 --> 00:15:35.200]  Now that's an aggression, but what about a microaggression as they're being called?
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:35.541]  We see...
[00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:44.947]  I mean most of the time I don't even talk about this social justice warrior stuff because there's just so much of it I think it's ridiculous and not even worth spending the time of day to give credence to.
[00:15:45.328 --> 00:15:50.531]  But now they say that a white person smiling at a black person is a racist microaggression.
[00:15:50.551 --> 00:15:56.196]  This is something your kids were indoctrinated with during Whiteness History Month at Portland College.
[00:15:56.696 --> 00:16:03.224]  And they had the kids and they're agonizing over whether or not smiling at a black person was racist or not smiling.
[00:16:03.625 --> 00:16:05.747]  And one person said, it's that, it's that awkward smile.
[00:16:06.067 --> 00:16:07.149]  Well, what am I supposed to do?
[00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:08.390]  I smile at everybody.
[00:16:09.226 --> 00:16:12.709]  But somehow I'm conscious of that, and I think, am I doing the white guy smile?
[00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:19.516]  Another one said, as much as I don't like to think of myself as having that awkwardness, there's always that.
[00:16:20.017 --> 00:16:22.799]  Am I doing the white guy smile, or is it a normal smile?
[00:16:22.839 --> 00:16:27.004]  And this is what I say to people, this is one of those, you can't do one thing or the other.
[00:16:27.844 --> 00:16:32.709]  The way the article was written to me, or the way this organization was run, if you
[00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:37.352]  Look at a black person and you don't smile, you're racist.
[00:16:37.612 --> 00:16:40.134]  If you look at a black person and do smile, you're racist.
[00:16:40.494 --> 00:16:44.256]  If you look at them while you're walking down the street, you're racist because you're suspicious of them.
[00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:48.158]  If you don't look at them, you're being racist because you're not paying attention to them.
[00:16:48.218 --> 00:16:51.660]  So anything you do would be misconstrued as racism.
[00:16:51.961 --> 00:16:55.863]  And this is a case in point where I don't think it's good to just
[00:16:56.283 --> 00:17:02.567]  Blanket, pay for everybody's college because if you want me to pay for college, you're going to have to move stuff out of this, like this out of the curriculum.
[00:17:02.587 --> 00:17:03.688]  This is freaking ridiculous.
[00:17:04.008 --> 00:17:07.991]  Telling people they have to be on pins and needles, not being able to do anything.
[00:17:08.011 --> 00:17:11.374]  It's just like you have to see somebody of whatever race or religion just
[00:17:11.834 --> 00:17:12.355]  We're good to go.
[00:17:27.453 --> 00:17:28.594]  They're talking about discrimination.
[00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:29.614]  The mom is talking to the son.
[00:17:30.055 --> 00:17:34.737]  And the son says, well, how does your policy help women with big boobies?
[00:17:34.777 --> 00:17:37.418]  She says, son, women with large breasts don't need any help.
[00:17:37.478 --> 00:17:38.479]  Well, they need help now.
[00:17:38.499 --> 00:17:42.581]  A woman gets asked to leave a gym because her boobs are too large.
[00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:45.002]  And basically, employees came up to her.
[00:17:45.062 --> 00:17:50.085]  They said that people were feeling uncomfortable because the woman's breasts were so large.
[00:17:50.125 --> 00:17:51.306]  And we will show you this.
[00:17:51.526 --> 00:17:52.026]  Cover your eyes.
[00:17:52.066 --> 00:17:54.448]  We got the children in the room, I guess.
[00:17:55.488 --> 00:17:57.730]  I can't help that my chest may appear large.
[00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:59.130]  I felt humiliated.
[00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:01.972]  I felt that I was uncomfortable and I was made to leave.
[00:18:01.992 --> 00:18:07.335]  And basically, on her way out the door, she asked the other women in the club if her attire offended them.
[00:18:07.355 --> 00:18:08.456]  I mean, yes, the lady is
[00:18:08.976 --> 00:18:09.417]  I don't know.
[00:18:27.136 --> 00:18:27.596]  Endowed.
[00:18:27.976 --> 00:18:29.777]  So you can take that for what you will.
[00:18:30.438 --> 00:18:37.801]  I know that's more of a lighthearted story, but coming up after this break, we'll have a very serious conversation with Conchita Sarnoff about human trafficking.
[00:18:37.841 --> 00:18:45.265]  But before that, I want to remind you to check out the hashtag InfoWarsGear and upload your InfoWars picks for a chance to win big bucks.
[00:18:45.685 --> 00:18:46.165]  Stay tuned.
[00:18:46.285 --> 00:18:47.786]  We'll be right back after this break.
[00:19:04.906 --> 00:19:09.309]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.091]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.773 --> 00:19:15.774]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in Brain Force, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:53.820]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2, Survival Shield, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.523]  Again, that's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:23:03.817 --> 00:23:07.458]  You've heard the names, Seville, Sandusky, and now Epstein.
[00:23:07.898 --> 00:23:14.680]  And now our guest today is going to talk about at least Epstein in her new book, Traffic King, which is available on ConchitaSarnoff.com.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:20.582]  She is Conchita Sarnoff, and she is the executive director of the Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking.
[00:23:21.042 --> 00:23:22.783]  And thank you for joining us today, Conchita.
[00:23:23.383 --> 00:23:24.543]  Thank you, Jakari.
[00:23:24.603 --> 00:23:26.444]  Thank you for having me on your show.
[00:23:26.744 --> 00:23:27.524]  Oh, it's our pleasure.
[00:23:27.884 --> 00:23:30.525]  Now, can you tell us a little bit about the book Traffic King?
[00:23:32.011 --> 00:23:32.672]  Yes, certainly.
[00:23:32.832 --> 00:23:36.556]  Well, the book came about as a result of my investigation.
[00:23:37.557 --> 00:23:52.752]  As you might know, I run a foundation in Washington, Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, which hopes to raise awareness and has been raising awareness of the issue of human trafficking in the United States.
[00:23:53.806 --> 00:24:03.392]  And as a result of my investigation into various human trafficking cases, I stumbled into the Epstein case unexpectedly.
[00:24:04.313 --> 00:24:09.837]  What was even more unexpected was the fact that I know Mr. Epstein and Ms.
[00:24:09.917 --> 00:24:20.003]  Maxwell, who is the alleged procurer who has been deposed, I believe, already by one of the former victims,
[00:24:21.404 --> 00:24:23.025]  Virginia Louise Roberts.
[00:24:23.646 --> 00:24:25.467]  And there's a pending case in New York.
[00:24:26.408 --> 00:24:28.910]  Virginia Louise Roberts versus Ghislaine Maxwell.
[00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.311]  It's a defamation case, a civil case.
[00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:39.517]  So, based on my research about the issue of human trafficking and based on the fact that I knew Ms.
[00:24:39.577 --> 00:24:46.903]  Maxwell and Mr. Epstein socially, I was stunned, number one, that I even knew people that could
[00:24:48.095 --> 00:24:55.396]  Supposedly, purportedly, commit such heinous crimes, and two, that people actually committed these crimes.
[00:24:56.076 --> 00:25:07.738]  So, that of course spiraled into a very long, protracted investigation, and seven years later, I finally published the book.
[00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:15.780]  I don't know if you're aware, but 27 publishers turned down my original manuscript.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:23.746]  I have gone through three agents who all worked very hard to have my book published and no one would publish the book.
[00:25:24.466 --> 00:25:26.448]  That is without even seeing the manuscript.
[00:25:26.528 --> 00:25:35.395]  All they saw was, of course, a synopsis and given the reasons that I was told by my agents,
[00:25:36.395 --> 00:25:50.560]  Um, primarily it was fear of a Clinton presidency and fear of litigation, of course, both by Mr. Epstein and some of the characters implicated in Mr. Epstein's case.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.481]  So there began this very long investigation.
[00:25:55.529 --> 00:26:03.011]  And this, as you might know, has been blasted across the media since 2010.
[00:26:03.271 --> 00:26:08.533]  The story first appeared in 2006, about a year after Mr. Epstein was arrested.
[00:26:08.913 --> 00:26:15.615]  He was arrested in Palm Beach in 2005 because one girl came forward to the Palm Beach Police Department.
[00:26:16.195 --> 00:26:21.617]  After that girl came forward, it sort of spiraled and over, I think over a hundred victims
[00:26:22.145 --> 00:26:23.967]  I'm sorry, I gotta interrupt you there, Conchita.
[00:26:23.987 --> 00:26:29.414]  Now, with all the people that came forward, are you saying they came forward against Epstein?
[00:26:37.455 --> 00:26:37.835]  Correct.
[00:26:38.176 --> 00:26:38.756]  That is correct.
[00:26:39.037 --> 00:26:40.719]  And these were all underage girls.
[00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:43.542]  That means all under the age of 18.
[00:26:44.363 --> 00:26:47.626]  So in Florida, the age of sexual consent is 18.
[00:26:48.407 --> 00:26:54.353]  So these girls who came forward, some came forward with their parents, others came forward independently.
[00:26:55.254 --> 00:27:01.317]  And, um, the case began, of course, by the Palm Beach Police Department.
[00:27:01.497 --> 00:27:12.202]  Chief Michael Ritter, who was the chief of police at the Palm Beach Police Department at the time, was in charge of this case with Officer Joe Recore.
[00:27:13.102 --> 00:27:22.366]  And there began a long two-year investigation in which there was a grand jury and then finally there was an FBI investigation.
[00:27:22.924 --> 00:27:38.374]  At which point the United States Attorney's Office, Mr. Alex Acosta, who was the prosecutor at the time, believed that there was sufficient evidence for the federal government to go forward into an investigation.
[00:27:38.434 --> 00:27:48.220]  Well, Mr. Epstein, who as you know is a Wall Street billionaire, registered sex offender level three, hired a slew of
[00:27:49.421 --> 00:28:06.732]  Absolutely star quality attorneys, including Mr. Kenneth Starr, who was the Solicitor General during the Bill Clinton impeachment and during the former president's Monica Lewinsky scandal.
[00:28:07.699 --> 00:28:11.361]  He was hired toward the very end of the negotiations.
[00:28:12.822 --> 00:28:18.065]  So was Alan Dershowitz, who actually was a friend of Mr. Epstein and was implicated in the case.
[00:28:18.185 --> 00:28:20.686]  And of course, you will read about all of this in the book.
[00:28:21.467 --> 00:28:23.148]  The book is called Trafficking.
[00:28:23.908 --> 00:28:32.133]  And other attorneys, other very prominent attorneys, were Roy Black, Gerald Lefcourt,
[00:28:33.095 --> 00:28:37.136]  Martin Weinberger and Jay Lefkowitz.
[00:28:37.397 --> 00:28:55.563]  And so here you have a star team of attorneys representing Mr. Epstein against dozens of underage girls who, of course, do not have the wherewithal, the resources, the financial resources to fight Mr. Epstein, certainly not civilly.
[00:28:56.483 --> 00:29:19.776]  And finally, the prosecution agreed that if Mr. Epstein agreed to one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor, that means that the minor who came forward was identified as a prostitute, which I find unbelievable, then if he would agree to that one count, and then there was another count,
[00:29:20.376 --> 00:29:25.379]  So there were in total two counts out of the multiple counts that he was originally charged with.
[00:29:25.779 --> 00:29:30.262]  If he agreed with that, then it would not be a federal case.
[00:29:30.302 --> 00:29:41.890]  So this became a state case and he was sentenced to 18 months in a county jail plus an additional 18 months under house arrest.
[00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.070]  He served only 13 months.
[00:29:44.251 --> 00:29:53.275]  in Palm Beach County Jail, not a federal prison, and consecutively with 18 months of house arrest in his Palm Beach estate.
[00:29:54.175 --> 00:30:05.200]  So, I think the reason this is important, one of the reasons, Jakari, this case is so important is because it has set precedent.
[00:30:05.902 --> 00:30:10.345]  Here you have a two-year-long federal investigation.
[00:30:11.606 --> 00:30:15.668]  The alleged trafficker, Mr. Epstein, is
[00:30:19.235 --> 00:30:29.518]  Indicted or given one count of, you know, one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor, he's given a non-prosecution agreement.
[00:30:30.158 --> 00:30:37.299]  He serves a minimum amount of time compared to other human traffickers who have been arrested with similar charges.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:46.902]  And now, several other human traffickers who have been arrested since Mr. Epstein was arrested have been using Mr. Epstein's case
[00:30:48.022 --> 00:31:01.212]  As president, we have one case in particular in Miami, Florida, the attorney Joel DeFabio is representing a convicted pedophile.
[00:31:01.673 --> 00:31:03.654]  He is in the process of being convicted.
[00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:07.637]  He was arrested and his name, ironically, is
[00:31:09.058 --> 00:31:25.492]  Michael Archangel Hernandez and this case is moving forward and they are using, Mr. DeFavio has used Mr. Epstein's defense in order to have his client receive a lesser sentence.
[00:31:25.832 --> 00:31:31.777]  Yes Conchita, I'm sorry we're low on time but people can definitely find out the rest of the information in Trafficking.
[00:31:32.177 --> 00:31:38.182]  Now briefly before we end, can you tell us about your organization, the Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking?
[00:31:38.692 --> 00:31:39.233]  Absolutely.
[00:31:40.414 --> 00:31:44.238]  My organization raises awareness of human trafficking.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:56.052]  I have a board, a number of former government officials are on my board, and community leaders, former ambassadors as well, and current ambassadors.
[00:31:56.652 --> 00:31:58.975]  And what we attempt to do is two things.
[00:31:59.015 --> 00:32:06.342]  Number one, raise awareness of the issue by one of the campaigns that we have is called Alert and Educated.
[00:32:06.422 --> 00:32:19.874]  We are trying to distribute for free an educational PowerPoint presentation to over 15,000 school districts that will help children and students and teachers and administrators learn how traffickers
[00:32:20.695 --> 00:32:26.390]  Identify and recruit victims today because it's not... Conchita, Conchita, can you hold that thought?
[00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.776]  We'll hold you over and we'll come back right after this break.
[00:33:02.335 --> 00:33:11.519]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important area of InfoWars that runs the whole operation that is having such a big effect against the globalists.
[00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:19.983]  And I've said it over and over again, it is you the listeners and the viewers that send us the intel, the news tips, that support the broadcast, that spread the word.
[00:33:20.883 --> 00:33:23.984]  You are 90% of the operation or more.
[00:33:24.024 --> 00:33:27.166]  You don't stand beside us, you stand at the heart of InfoWars.
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.

[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:30.494]  Now it's finally here.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:04.582 --> 00:37:05.423]  All right, and welcome back.
[00:37:05.503 --> 00:37:08.466]  Our guest is Conchita Sarnoff with the book Trafficking.
[00:37:08.846 --> 00:37:14.471]  Conchita, you were cut off by the break and you were telling us about your organization, the Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking.
[00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:16.120]  Yes, thank you.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:24.086]  As I was saying, the situation with, forgive me, something happened here.
[00:37:24.286 --> 00:37:37.157]  As I was saying, what we are attempting to do, what the Foundation is attempting to do is to raise awareness of the issue of human trafficking and also we would like to open the first safe house to rescue victims in the Washington, D.C.
[00:37:37.277 --> 00:37:37.577]  area.
[00:37:37.977 --> 00:37:40.940]  Washington, D.C., our nation's capital, does not have a safe house.
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:51.532]  One of the biggest problems and one of the biggest reasons why victims today do not come forward as easily as they should is because they have nowhere to go after they come forward.
[00:37:51.592 --> 00:37:55.877]  So if they're arrested, then they're let out on the street.
[00:37:56.538 --> 00:37:59.481]  If they're not arrested and they escape from their traffickers,
[00:38:00.322 --> 00:38:01.784]  They have usually nowhere to go.
[00:38:01.864 --> 00:38:04.887]  Do they go back home where the problem began, usually?
[00:38:05.528 --> 00:38:07.390]  Or do they stay out in the street?
[00:38:07.671 --> 00:38:09.352]  Or do they have a friend where they can live with?
[00:38:09.433 --> 00:38:11.114]  I mean, it's an enormous problem.
[00:38:11.975 --> 00:38:13.677]  You see all these movies.
[00:38:14.418 --> 00:38:18.543]  There's a movie that just came out, The Abolitionist, a fantastic documentary.
[00:38:18.923 --> 00:38:22.466]  about what's going on in the world of human trafficking, but guess what?
[00:38:23.006 --> 00:38:28.490]  It's all filmed abroad, in Haiti, in Colombia, in Mexico.
[00:38:28.991 --> 00:38:37.637]  Why do they not film that documentary in the United States when the problem is so prevalent in this country?
[00:38:38.057 --> 00:38:44.742]  According to Congress in 2012, over 300,000 American children were trafficked.
[00:38:45.223 --> 00:38:46.784]  According to the United Nations,
[00:38:48.461 --> 00:38:51.363]  22 million children are trafficked.
[00:38:51.503 --> 00:39:00.088]  I mean, we don't have accurate numbers, as you might know, because the first point of defense is always the police department.
[00:39:00.609 --> 00:39:09.294]  So for the police to have an accurate figure, an accurate count of the number of victims in each district, in each area,
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.705]  They have to arrest the victim and then they have to know that that victim is a trafficked victim and not anything else.
[00:39:17.365 --> 00:39:29.254]  So it is a very complicated problem and nobody has really drilled down to the very root of this problem, which is why are there so many children being trafficked?
[00:39:29.354 --> 00:39:33.336]  Well, one reason certainly is the increase in child pornography.
[00:39:33.517 --> 00:39:36.919]  As you know, pornography today is the largest business online.
[00:39:37.429 --> 00:39:40.632]  And child pornography is the second largest business online.
[00:39:41.192 --> 00:39:52.943]  Thirdly, this whole issue of pedophilia, some researchers want to describe the issue of pedophilia as just another sexual orientation.
[00:39:53.003 --> 00:39:55.105]  Well, is it really a sexual orientation?
[00:39:55.125 --> 00:40:02.451]  Yeah, we see groups like, I believe it was Salon, just to cut in briefly, they keep putting out these articles trying to normalize pedophilia.
[00:40:03.018 --> 00:40:04.460]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:17.876]  And I was reading, you know, there's now a very interesting, several articles have come out now about this medication which is currently being used for prostate cancer, for advanced prostate cancer.
[00:40:17.936 --> 00:40:20.099]  And in Sweden, the Karolinska Institute
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:45.569]  They've brought in 60 pedophiles of which they're going to give this medication, Degarolex, I believe is the name, and the Swiss pharmaceutical that produces the medication is called Ferring, and they're going to give the medication to 30 of those 60 pedophiles and the other 30 are simply going to receive a placebo.
[00:40:46.289 --> 00:40:49.091]  And so they're going to study the effects of the medication.
[00:40:49.271 --> 00:41:00.737]  One of the reasons some of these medications or this particular medication has worked on some pedophiles is because it is a hormone therapy.
[00:41:01.157 --> 00:41:04.319]  It decreases the testosterone.
[00:41:04.359 --> 00:41:13.324]  It sort of blocks the testosterone, which as you know is the culprit behind sexual desire and lack of empathy and also
[00:41:14.605 --> 00:41:14.946]  That's right.
[00:41:31.142 --> 00:41:41.164]  For different indications, such as advanced prostate cancer, and now are going to try to see if pedophilia will be curbed.
[00:41:41.585 --> 00:41:45.966]  Now, you know, we could go on forever about the issues of pedophilia.
[00:41:46.046 --> 00:41:59.009]  I am not a medical doctor, I am not a psychiatrist or a therapist, but I have read enough to know that there are many issues why, or at least I believe given what I've read, given the literature, why
[00:42:00.049 --> 00:42:01.690]  People become pedophiles.
[00:42:03.051 --> 00:42:07.975]  And so we need to understand in this country that is it a disease?
[00:42:08.035 --> 00:42:08.315]  Yes.
[00:42:08.575 --> 00:42:10.257]  Should pedophiles go to jail?
[00:42:11.117 --> 00:42:11.758]  I don't know.
[00:42:11.878 --> 00:42:18.483]  Should there be a medical institution where these pedophiles go to in order for them to stop harming our children?
[00:42:19.023 --> 00:42:22.805]  I believe that yes, they should definitely be instituted somewhere.
[00:42:23.125 --> 00:42:28.048]  And if this medication works on pedophiles, then absolutely.
[00:42:28.128 --> 00:42:37.673]  I believe like in London, where some prisoners are being given the medication, I believe that this medication should be given in prisons where there are pedophiles.
[00:42:37.953 --> 00:42:38.474]  Absolutely.
[00:42:39.494 --> 00:42:42.637]  Especially those pedophiles who are going to come out into society.
[00:42:44.139 --> 00:42:46.361]  Now, that does not solve the issue.
[00:42:46.541 --> 00:42:48.223]  The trafficker is a whole different story.
[00:42:48.263 --> 00:42:53.828]  The trafficker, Jakari, as you know, is sort of like a car salesman.
[00:42:53.868 --> 00:42:58.233]  I mean, he can sell a car the same way he can sell a child or he can sell a pair of shoes.
[00:42:58.733 --> 00:43:12.062]  He just simply wants money and you know the risk reward is pretty amazing which is why today trafficking has become the number one crime far exceeding drug trafficking and weapons trafficking.
[00:43:12.233 --> 00:43:16.194]  Now Conchita, if I could just interrupt you for one second, I definitely want you to finish on your trafficking.
[00:43:16.235 --> 00:43:26.298]  But before we move too far away from the sex offenders and the people of that like, earlier in our earlier segment you mentioned that Epstein was a sex offender level 3.
[00:43:26.578 --> 00:43:29.620]  I was not aware that there were levels to sex offenders.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.300]  Do you have a breakdown of that?
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:31.380]  Yes.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.401]  Of what fits into what category?
[00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:34.749]  Yes, Jakari.
[00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:36.170]  There are three levels.
[00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:40.772]  Sex offender level one, sex offender level two, and sex offender level three.
[00:43:41.292 --> 00:43:44.834]  Level one, of course, is the least offensive of all three.
[00:43:45.414 --> 00:43:50.016]  And he is probably the one that, I'll give you a story, a very interesting story.
[00:43:50.136 --> 00:44:02.302]  I spoke to a judge in New York, Judge Ruth Pickles, who actually was the one who gave, who registered Mr. Epstein as a level three sex offender.
[00:44:02.802 --> 00:44:06.884]  And she told me a story about how this former U.S.
[00:44:07.124 --> 00:44:14.488]  Army officer, I believe he was in his early 20s, had been arrested because he had met a young girl who was age 17 at a bar.
[00:44:14.548 --> 00:44:15.428]  She had lied to him.
[00:44:15.488 --> 00:44:18.470]  She had told him that she was over the age of consent.
[00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:20.911]  They had had a sexual relationship.
[00:44:21.271 --> 00:44:24.213]  It had carried on for a number of months or a number of weeks.
[00:44:24.833 --> 00:44:28.555]  And then her parents found out and brought charges against the young man.
[00:44:28.915 --> 00:44:29.956]  And he was charged.
[00:44:29.996 --> 00:44:30.796]  He was arrested.
[00:44:31.136 --> 00:44:31.957]  He went to jail.
[00:44:32.977 --> 00:44:33.418]  Excuse me.
[00:44:33.838 --> 00:44:43.244]  And then he went before Judge Pickles, and the Manhattan District Attorney asked her to register him as a level three.
[00:44:43.545 --> 00:44:44.265]  She refused.
[00:44:44.325 --> 00:44:45.266]  She said, absolutely not.
[00:44:45.306 --> 00:44:47.908]  This young man's life has already been ruined.
[00:44:48.668 --> 00:44:51.470]  I'll let you finish, but just to let you know, we have about a minute left.
[00:44:51.775 --> 00:45:08.884]  Okay, anyway, so there are three levels and Epstein was registered, according to Judge Pickles, in the highest level, level three, which is the most dangerous type of all, because it usually means someone who is recurring and who will recur.
[00:45:10.225 --> 00:45:12.006]  Okay, well thank you so much Conchita.
[00:45:12.266 --> 00:45:21.292]  Once again, the book is Trafficking, available at conchitasarnoff.com, and also the Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking.
[00:45:21.412 --> 00:45:26.535]  It's www.atrvt.org.
[00:45:27.056 --> 00:45:30.638]  Well thank you so much Conchita, and we definitely look forward to having you back on in the future.
[00:45:31.018 --> 00:45:31.779]  Thank you very much.
[00:45:32.449 --> 00:45:33.430]  And there goes Conchita.
[00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:41.093]  You can get her book Traffic King available at ConchitaSarnoff.com and also check out the Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking.
[00:45:41.554 --> 00:45:46.676]  Now coming up next in our next segment, we'll have an explosive report fully loaded by Derry McBrain.
[00:45:46.716 --> 00:45:49.538]  He's bringing you the issue of the importance of the Second Amendment.
[00:45:49.898 --> 00:45:50.418]  Stay tuned.
[00:46:03.086 --> 00:46:18.477]  You know, with all this talk lately about gun control, it occurred to me that I've yet to see a single politician who can explain to me how they plan to take guns away from the criminal thugs who are out there on the streets right now.
[00:46:19.138 --> 00:46:25.583]  Oh sure, you'll hear plenty of talk about how they plan to take guns away from us, us law-abiding citizens.
[00:46:26.243 --> 00:46:34.726]  But if you take guns away from all of us legal gun owners, then the only people that will have guns will be the bad guys.
[00:46:35.387 --> 00:46:36.607]  In fact, I'm curious.
[00:46:37.007 --> 00:46:38.768]  I want to see a show of hands right now.
[00:46:39.128 --> 00:46:41.189]  All those for gun control, raise your hands.
[00:46:41.789 --> 00:46:44.610]  Alright, there's one, two, three, four.
[00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:46.011]  Anyone else?
[00:46:48.032 --> 00:46:49.392]  Ah, see there, that figures.
[00:46:49.933 --> 00:46:51.273]  All the usual suspects.
[00:46:52.434 --> 00:46:53.014]  Any questions?
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.462]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:09.783]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:16.706]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.701]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:48:41.081 --> 00:48:46.583]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.

[00:49:08.444 --> 00:49:14.008]  Hillary Clinton says the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.
[00:49:14.408 --> 00:49:28.638]  And if she, God forbid, becomes president, her administration will launch a new effort to not only ban so-called assault weapons, but a nationwide gun ban on everything.
[00:49:28.938 --> 00:49:32.701]  We're talking about a total repeal of the Second Amendment.
[00:49:33.101 --> 00:49:36.923]  Which, according to Hillary, is worth consideration.
[00:49:37.443 --> 00:49:41.885]  That's what we are facing right now with a potential Clinton presidency.
[00:49:42.845 --> 00:49:54.910]  Recently, Australia managed to get away, or take away, tens of thousands, millions of handguns.
[00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:57.991]  And in one year, they're all gone.
[00:49:58.972 --> 00:49:59.872]  Can we do that?
[00:50:00.132 --> 00:50:02.033]  And why, if we can't, why can't we?
[00:50:03.058 --> 00:50:04.779]  You know, Australia is a good example.
[00:50:04.999 --> 00:50:06.300]  Canada is a good example.
[00:50:06.841 --> 00:50:08.542]  The UK is a good example.
[00:50:08.602 --> 00:50:08.902]  Why?
[00:50:10.063 --> 00:50:11.924]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[00:50:12.705 --> 00:50:17.688]  And in reaction, they passed much stricter gun laws.
[00:50:18.269 --> 00:50:19.770]  So I think that's worth considering.
[00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:27.115]  I don't know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work, but certainly the Australian example is worth looking at.
[00:50:27.777 --> 00:50:29.057]  So I'm going to speak out.
[00:50:29.198 --> 00:50:36.520]  I'm going to do everything I can to rally people against this pernicious, corrupting influence of the NRA.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.340]  We've got to go after this.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:42.762]  And here again, the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.
[00:50:43.162 --> 00:50:45.983]  And I am going to make that case every chance I get.
[00:50:48.191 --> 00:50:54.456]  Now, her appetite for gun control has been blatantly obvious throughout her entire campaign.
[00:50:55.137 --> 00:51:05.025]  And it's no secret that a President Hillary Clinton would use executive orders to strip away our God-given right to self-defense.
[00:51:05.465 --> 00:51:07.647]  In fact, Hillary says Amen to that.
[00:51:10.376 --> 00:51:16.458]  We need you to be able to use your executive powers to legislate that you can't carry guns in cars.
[00:51:16.918 --> 00:51:21.660]  You can't bring guns in buildings that are not insured to carry them.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:30.563]  We need executive powers that say that we will fight for life and not kowtow to the sons and daughters of Charleston Heston.
[00:51:31.738 --> 00:51:34.941]  We can't kowtow to the sons and daughters of Charlton Heston.
[00:51:35.221 --> 00:51:37.043]  We must have a greater voice.
[00:51:37.483 --> 00:51:39.726]  Thank you for coming, and I will elect you.
[00:51:40.306 --> 00:51:40.526]  Vote.
[00:51:47.673 --> 00:51:50.376]  Well, let the congregation say, Amen.
[00:51:53.632 --> 00:52:04.879]  Now Hillary's daughter, Chelsea Clinton, whose real father, by the way, is very likely to be Webster Hubble, but hey, let's not tell anyone because the Clintons really want to keep that a secret.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:22.351]  But anyway, Chelsea Clinton has also been hitting the campaign trail in support of her mom, and she says now that Justice Scalia is dead and out of the way, the Supreme Court can finally make a definitive ruling on gun control.
[00:52:23.271 --> 00:52:29.414]  With Justice Scalia on the bench, one of the few areas where the court actually had an inconsistent record relates to gun control.
[00:52:30.055 --> 00:52:49.865]  So if you listen to Moms Demand Action and the Brady Campaign and the major efforts pushing for smart, sensible, and enforceable gun control across our country, which in disclosure have endorsed my mom, they say they believe the next time the court rules on gun control, it will make a definitive ruling.
[00:52:51.466 --> 00:52:56.030]  There's proof right there, ladies and gentlemen, that you really need to spay and neuter your Democrats.
[00:52:56.910 --> 00:53:02.694]  Because it looks like Chelsea is going to be every bit as evil and nasty as her mom.
[00:53:03.895 --> 00:53:15.304]  So it matters to me that my mom's the only person running for president who not only constantly makes that connection, but also has a strong record on gun control and standing up to the NRA.
[00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:18.591]  And here's a newsflash for the Clintons.
[00:53:19.092 --> 00:53:22.034]  America doesn't have a gun problem.
[00:53:22.534 --> 00:53:25.556]  America has a gang problem.
[00:53:26.456 --> 00:53:32.821]  And in gun-free zones like Chicago, there's already been over a thousand shootings this year.
[00:53:33.201 --> 00:53:33.921]  And guess what?
[00:53:34.622 --> 00:53:38.904]  Not one of the shooters was a member of the NRA.
[00:53:41.366 --> 00:53:43.507]  From my cold dead hands,
[00:53:48.067 --> 00:53:54.513]  A well-regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state.
[00:53:55.134 --> 00:54:03.061]  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, says the Second Amendment of the U.S.
[00:54:03.281 --> 00:54:04.082]  Constitution.
[00:54:04.543 --> 00:54:05.524]  It's not about hunting.
[00:54:06.084 --> 00:54:12.047]  And it's not about sport, and it's not just about protecting yourself, your family, and your property.
[00:54:12.367 --> 00:54:14.568]  No, the Second Amendment is much more than that.
[00:54:15.048 --> 00:54:19.570]  It's about protecting yourself from a tyrannical government.
[00:54:20.031 --> 00:54:30.656]  And it was written by men, true patriots, who believed that our government, and even our own military, might be forced to one day turn against us.
[00:54:31.716 --> 00:54:36.580]  And the Second Amendment was written to guarantee that that will never happen.
[00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:46.768]  I must tell you, the right to defend yourself, the right to keep and bear arms, does not protect your right to shoot deer.
[00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:53.094]  It protects your right to shoot at the government when it is taken over by tyrants.
[00:54:53.574 --> 00:54:54.395]  These are
[00:55:01.647 --> 00:55:03.649]  The quintessential American right.
[00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:06.571]  The right to be left alone.
[00:55:08.052 --> 00:55:21.963]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:55:22.163 --> 00:55:27.868]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:55:29.226 --> 00:55:31.108]  We just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:55:31.148 --> 00:55:35.791]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:55:35.831 --> 00:55:42.637]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:55:42.797 --> 00:55:43.077]  Enough.
[00:55:43.638 --> 00:55:43.918]  Enough.
[00:55:44.438 --> 00:55:44.739]  Enough.
[00:55:45.499 --> 00:55:45.719]  Enough.
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.040]  Mayor Bloomberg, how you doing?
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.341]  Jason, I grew up in Brooklyn.
[00:55:48.361 --> 00:55:51.704]  In the spirit of gun control, will you disarm your entire security team?
[00:55:52.725 --> 00:55:53.846]  You will get back to me?
[00:55:56.294 --> 00:56:00.538]  They may feel that it's part of a romanticized culture.
[00:56:00.879 --> 00:56:05.223]  There's an aspect of this, a kind of Wild West, cowboy, Dirty Harry aspect.
[00:56:05.403 --> 00:56:08.146]  There's also an aspect... So they're macho men and they gotta have a gun?
[00:56:08.286 --> 00:56:08.827]  Go ahead.
[00:56:09.868 --> 00:56:10.729]  Make my day.
[00:56:11.089 --> 00:56:14.473]  Anybody that wants to disarm me can drop dead.
[00:56:15.734 --> 00:56:31.790]  Vice President Biden and I had a meeting with a group of technology people and talked about how guns can be made more safe by making them either through fingerprint identification, the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you might wear.
[00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:37.276]  Anybody that wants to make me unarmed and helpless, people that want to literally create the proven
[00:56:38.393 --> 00:56:43.477]  Places where more innocents are killed, called gun-free zones, we're gonna beat you.
[00:56:43.497 --> 00:56:46.579]  We're gonna vote you out of office, or suck on my machine gun.
[00:56:46.619 --> 00:56:53.845]  That's why you're going to fail, and the establishment knows, no matter how much propaganda, the Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[00:56:53.965 --> 00:56:56.047]  Guns will be taken, no one will be able to be armed.
[00:56:56.327 --> 00:56:57.288]  We will take all weapons.
[00:56:57.548 --> 00:57:05.874]  I believe that as Americans, we have a right to arm ourselves against criminals, but we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army, or the police.
[00:57:06.214 --> 00:57:08.216]  The United States military is not out to get us.
[00:57:08.416 --> 00:57:10.699]  And I think that's a healthy thing to question your government.
[00:57:11.099 --> 00:57:14.383]  I don't think it's particularly healthy to question the military.
[00:57:14.503 --> 00:57:15.444]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:57:15.725 --> 00:57:16.746]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:17.927]  Mao took the guns.
[00:57:18.107 --> 00:57:19.449]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:20.831]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:57:21.011 --> 00:57:26.277]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:57:26.477 --> 00:57:28.278]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:32.559]  I wouldn't feel comfortable having an argument with him in his home.
[00:57:32.779 --> 00:57:38.761]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him!
[00:57:38.961 --> 00:57:39.681]  I'd love to see that!
[00:57:40.401 --> 00:57:41.061]  In uniform!
[00:57:42.081 --> 00:57:49.644]  You don't have that much time to take away Americans' guns, declare martial law, and put hard-working Americans in FEMA camps.
[00:57:49.724 --> 00:57:50.744]  If you're gonna do that,
[00:57:51.994 --> 00:57:53.155]  You better get started.
[00:57:53.175 --> 00:57:56.856]  Hey, that's going to do it for tonight's broadcast.
[00:57:56.876 --> 00:58:00.978]  The InfoWars Nightly News will return tomorrow evening, 7 o'clock p.m.
[00:58:01.058 --> 00:58:01.818]  Central Time.
[00:58:01.878 --> 00:58:03.419]  Until then, have a great night.
[00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:04.720]  We'll see you back here tomorrow.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:05.200]  See ya!
[00:58:11.118 --> 00:58:18.064]  Alright, we're going to cut this segment short because I understand we have an urgent phone call right now from Admiral Ackbar of the Rebel Alliance.
[00:58:18.544 --> 00:58:19.906]  Admiral, thanks for joining us.
[00:58:19.926 --> 00:58:22.568]  You know, we were just talking about the internet kill switch.
[00:58:23.088 --> 00:58:29.594]  And Barack Obama, you know, he just said that he thinks we should hand power of the internet over to the federal government.
[00:58:29.614 --> 00:58:31.776]  I think that sounds like a scary thought.
[00:58:31.956 --> 00:58:36.020]  And Obama says it will be used fairly and distributed equally.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.100]  What do you say to that?
[00:58:38.061 --> 00:58:38.522]  It's a trap!
[00:58:40.615 --> 00:58:41.038]  What happened?
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:42.707]  Did we just... Did we lose them?
[00:59:03.846 --> 00:59:04.986]  Knockout is back.
[00:59:05.347 --> 00:59:16.430]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:18.531]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:19.051 --> 00:59:28.174]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:28.574 --> 00:59:30.334]  All organic, all the natural sources.
