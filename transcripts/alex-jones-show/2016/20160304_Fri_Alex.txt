[00:00:02.213 --> 00:00:04.823]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:17.719]  Big Brother.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.420]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.261]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:22.721]  You want answers?
[00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:24.402]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:25.062 --> 00:00:28.684]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:33.346]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:43.710]  Well, what happened last night at that Fox News debate shows you why Donald Trump skipped the last one.
[00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:49.583]  Because it was a bloodbath lynching.
[00:00:49.603 --> 00:00:51.745]  It reminded me of the movie Gladiator.
[00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:57.809]  A composite actually based on three different events that actually happened in Rome.
[00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.413]  The Patriot is based on three different events that actually happened in the Revolutionary War.
[00:01:04.294 --> 00:01:05.175]  But I digress.
[00:01:06.236 --> 00:01:10.979]  It was like each contest where Maximus goes out and wins, it gets more rigged.
[00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.683]  Where they've got five lions going after him as he battles the former champion.
[00:01:16.727 --> 00:01:22.189]  And then you've got them stabbing him in the side before they send him out to fight the emperor.
[00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:30.291]  There was really a Roman emperor that actually did that stuff and killed members of his family, but that's why history is so fascinating.
[00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:41.075]  Donald Trump was basically crucified last night, and Megyn Kelly
[00:01:42.076 --> 00:01:45.319]  With that blazing, perfectly lit, perfect makeup.
[00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:48.582]  Looked like some type of angelic Valkyrie.
[00:01:49.302 --> 00:01:52.866]  But her eyes had witch-like focus and hatred.
[00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.549]  And they set her up to destroy him.
[00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.273]  They had all these canned video packages and graphics demonizing Trump.
[00:02:02.794 --> 00:02:04.496]  I believe it will backfire on them.
[00:02:07.992 --> 00:02:13.776]  That said, Trump probably had his worst performance ever and I've watched all the debates.
[00:02:15.537 --> 00:02:22.961]  I had our coverage on the laptop and then I had it on the television watching Fox News and was basically tuned into both.
[00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:27.544]  I had earpieces in because my children couldn't stand having two feeds on.
[00:02:28.104 --> 00:02:37.050]  They were watching Fox, but I was listening to our feed with our reporters doing a great job breaking it down, but it was just over the top.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.064]  And Trump, a lot of the time, basically had his hands down on his side like a boxer who's exhausted.
[00:02:49.987 --> 00:02:51.148]  It was just such a spectacle.
[00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:52.149]  It's bigger than Trump.
[00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.031]  It's bigger than the American people, people the world even.
[00:02:55.051 --> 00:03:02.216]  It's just a spectacle of controlled corporate media trying to stay relevant, desperately trying to control the narrative.
[00:03:03.437 --> 00:03:05.059]  And Trump's numbers only go up.
[00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.139]  The problem is,
[00:03:07.202 --> 00:03:11.805]  Trump is beginning to say he's a unifier and trying to be nice to the mainstream media.
[00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:22.090]  That is the one thing that will turn people against him because they're so anti-establishment and the establishment must be listening to me because Gawker got it right and others actually got it right.
[00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.574]  I can't believe I'm saying Gawker got it right when they said that Trump was set up and it was a trap.
[00:03:30.148 --> 00:03:39.993]  When I saw Rupert Murdoch tweet that, oh, Trump's pretty good and we might as well go ahead and endorse him and be nice to him, they knew Trump was still thinking about last minute and not going.
[00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:41.914]  They had Kelly saying nice things.
[00:03:42.234 --> 00:03:43.094]  Come on in.
[00:03:44.195 --> 00:03:45.095]  Come on in.
[00:03:47.276 --> 00:03:49.357]  Come on in and sit down like the mafia.
[00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:50.698]  They shoot you right in the back of the head.
[00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.701]  And I just had a feeling when I was leaving the office yesterday and reading those tweets and things, I said, this is going to be a bloodbath.
[00:03:57.721 --> 00:03:58.502]  This is a setup.
[00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:06.554]  And I saw his son on the sidelines and his wife, the staged booing and the hissing and everything being rigged.
[00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:10.337]  They look like deer in the headlights at the end of that.
[00:04:10.518 --> 00:04:22.388]  And Trump, when he talked to Bill O'Reilly, looked like he figured out he'd had his nose bloodied and this was serious.
[00:04:22.808 --> 00:04:24.510]  It's the first time I've seen Trump shaken.
[00:04:26.857 --> 00:04:39.043]  Roger Stone is popping in right after the break, but just imagine thousands of people booing you, all regged, packed in there by Romney's family member that runs the whole show, his niece.
[00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:43.732]  The light just blown out on him.
[00:04:43.752 --> 00:04:46.913]  All targeted to where he was glowing.
[00:04:47.493 --> 00:04:48.253]  Looked terrible.
[00:04:48.293 --> 00:04:50.634]  They had just lights in his face.
[00:04:50.654 --> 00:04:51.794]  That's a tactic they use.
[00:04:52.254 --> 00:04:53.515]  Just cranking him way up.
[00:04:54.075 --> 00:04:56.316]  Just everything was scientifically set.
[00:04:56.436 --> 00:04:59.317]  Weeks of planning in that ambush.
[00:04:59.557 --> 00:05:03.118]  And it just endears Trump to me more.
[00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:07.779]  The problem is some of the things Trump said I don't like.
[00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:10.180]  Including how he likes the head of the CFR.
[00:05:11.604 --> 00:05:12.544]  Who do you prefer?
[00:05:12.844 --> 00:05:16.046]  Barack Obama or George W. Bush?
[00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:21.368]  Well, if you haven't figured it out by now, these guys are corporate spokesmen.
[00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:22.188]  They're not leaders.
[00:05:22.448 --> 00:05:24.769]  I mean, they both started illegal wars.
[00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:26.690]  Hell, they both tortured people.
[00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.531]  They bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you.
[00:05:30.711 --> 00:05:35.093]  They both violated the Constitution and they even committed war crimes.
[00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:36.314]  So what's it gonna take?
[00:05:36.594 --> 00:05:39.055]  I mean, what will it take to finally wake you up?
[00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:39.876]  Think about it.
[00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:49.081]  If Joseph Stalin ran for president as a Democrat and Adolf Hitler ran as a Republican, one of them would end up leading our country.
[00:05:49.422 --> 00:05:51.363]  It's politics incorporated.
[00:05:51.603 --> 00:05:54.985]  And your choice between the two parties is a myth.
[00:05:55.185 --> 00:05:59.948]  Because in reality, it is a two-party tyranny with one ideology.
[00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.549]  Divide and conquer.
[00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:06.540]  So join the revolution and break the false left versus right paradigm.

[00:07:10.882 --> 00:07:13.843]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:07:14.063 --> 00:07:16.224]  Deep Cleanze by Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:16.424 --> 00:07:23.126]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[00:07:38.172 --> 00:07:46.797]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[00:07:47.057 --> 00:07:53.982]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spite G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[00:07:54.142 --> 00:07:59.505]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs, backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best
[00:07:59.945 --> 00:08:01.206]  Hello boys and girls.
[00:08:01.326 --> 00:08:04.989]  I have a special message for you from the President of the United States.
[00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:34.658]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:08:34.938 --> 00:08:44.145]  And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[00:08:45.606 --> 00:08:51.975]  This is Warner Crime Guide in our newsroom and there has been an attempt that perhaps you know now on the life of President Kennedy.
[00:08:52.195 --> 00:08:57.423]  The initial attack on the destroyer Maddox on August 2nd was repeated today.
[00:08:57.443 --> 00:09:02.289]  Psychological warfare operations went into high gear.
[00:09:05.683 --> 00:09:14.885]  In retaliation for this unprovoked attack on the high seas, our forces have struck the bases used by the North Vietnamese patrol craft.
[00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:17.626]  It would allow the President to wage war in Vietnam.
[00:09:17.686 --> 00:09:19.206]  Just run and escape
[00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:41.733]  In 1976, Flight 455, which took off from Venezuela, bound for Cuba, suddenly exploded.
[00:09:42.474 --> 00:09:47.781]  All 73 passengers and 5 crew members aboard died after the plane crashed near Barbados.
[00:09:56.752 --> 00:09:59.312]  William Colby has been missing since April 27.
[00:09:59.792 --> 00:10:04.773]  His canoe was found washed up on the banks of the Wicomico River April 28.
[00:10:08.114 --> 00:10:09.674]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[00:10:10.014 --> 00:10:11.455]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[00:10:11.675 --> 00:10:16.796]  I've always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language are
[00:10:17.607 --> 00:10:19.532]  I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[00:10:24.231 --> 00:10:26.492]  All right, what is the Trilateral Commission?
[00:10:26.552 --> 00:10:30.813]  It's an organization founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller.
[00:10:30.893 --> 00:10:38.256]  They're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:49.480]  To work to erase national boundaries, create an international community, and in time bring about a one world government with David Rockefeller calling the shot!
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.921]  I understand he was tapped for skull and bones.
[00:10:52.781 --> 00:10:53.702]  Tap for it.
[00:10:54.243 --> 00:10:56.706]  Sir, he found it, skull and bones.
[00:10:56.786 --> 00:10:59.829]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore.
[00:11:00.209 --> 00:11:07.097]  We sit in the house, and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
[00:11:07.157 --> 00:11:11.522]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-built radios, and I won't say anything.
[00:11:11.722 --> 00:11:12.543]  Just leave us alone.
[00:11:12.783 --> 00:11:14.105]  Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
[00:11:15.005 --> 00:11:16.126]  I want you to get mad!
[00:11:16.427 --> 00:11:17.968]  We have got to fight and stand up!
[00:11:18.048 --> 00:11:19.589]  It's not gonna be easy!
[00:11:19.669 --> 00:11:20.970]  But I'll assure you this!
[00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.793]  We can, and we will, and we must prevail!
[00:11:26.014 --> 00:11:33.861]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.662]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have never seen such a staged event.
[00:11:44.722 --> 00:11:52.667]  The lights turned way up, focused right on Donald Trump's face where he glowed and looked terrible and couldn't think.
[00:11:52.687 --> 00:11:55.048]  They can turn those stage lights up to where they burn you.
[00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:56.249]  You could see it.
[00:11:56.469 --> 00:11:57.530]  I run a TV studio.
[00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.991]  I've been doing this for 20 plus years.
[00:11:59.391 --> 00:12:00.112]  I know what I saw.
[00:12:00.412 --> 00:12:09.978]  The rigged packages, the rigged video productions, the graphics, everything pointed at Donald Trump.
[00:12:10.885 --> 00:12:12.106]  Will it backfire on him?
[00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:15.290]  I mean, even liberal gawkers said Donald Trump was set up.
[00:12:16.971 --> 00:12:18.453]  Breitbart, debate disgrace.
[00:12:18.513 --> 00:12:21.336]  Fox News exposes pro-Rubio super PAC.
[00:12:23.037 --> 00:12:25.200]  Facebook refuses to remove for weeks.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.262]  Assassinate Donald Trump page.
[00:12:28.689 --> 00:12:35.572]  And Drudge polled, he wins 54.92, doubling what Cruz has in a far second, 25.56.
[00:12:36.052 --> 00:12:39.954]  Kasich at 14, Rubio at 5, but still they force-feed Rubio.
[00:12:40.314 --> 00:12:42.315]  Other scientific polls basically show the same numbers.
[00:12:44.095 --> 00:12:46.296]  Gingrich, and then we're going to our guest at the bottom of the hour.
[00:12:46.596 --> 00:12:52.379]  Gingrich, establishment scared of Trump because he didn't belong to the secret society.
[00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:53.139]  Let's play that clip.
[00:12:54.751 --> 00:13:01.237]  Uh, and now they're faced with a very real prospect of Donald Trump becoming the leader of the party and it absolutely drives them crazy.
[00:13:01.798 --> 00:13:03.479]  Uh, they just cannot imagine sharing.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:03.900]  Why?
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.361]  Well, because he's an outsider.
[00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:06.002]  He's not them.
[00:13:06.042 --> 00:13:07.103]  He's not part of the club.
[00:13:07.543 --> 00:13:08.584]  He's uncontrollable.
[00:13:09.265 --> 00:13:11.607]  Uh, you know, he hasn't been through the initiation rites.
[00:13:11.647 --> 00:13:13.309]  He didn't belong to the secret society.
[00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.111]  Um, and I think that they, they don't see him.
[00:13:16.532 --> 00:13:18.534]  They have no idea how to relate to him.
[00:13:19.201 --> 00:13:22.726]  I can't believe how everything we've talked about for decades is just naked out in the open.
[00:13:22.746 --> 00:13:24.729]  Scalia died in the secret society ritual.
[00:13:25.109 --> 00:13:26.691]  Yeah, he's not part of the society.
[00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:31.418]  And by the way, there is a society at the top.
[00:13:33.243 --> 00:13:35.165]  And I tell you, it is just amazing.
[00:13:35.826 --> 00:13:47.458]  I really appreciate former campaign head for Trump and longtime friend and confidant, Mr. Stone, who talked to him, obviously, before and after the debate, but that'll go unsaid here today to join us for this segment and the next.
[00:13:47.518 --> 00:13:50.061]  And then the other news is just over the top.
[00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:52.544]  BMW says, hey, soon you'll be able to drive your car.
[00:13:53.977 --> 00:13:57.839]  They've arrested people in six states in a third roundup with the whole Bundy thing.
[00:13:58.099 --> 00:13:59.239]  They're trying to tie that to Trump.
[00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:00.460]  This is getting crazy.
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.021]  We've got incredible jobs numbers.
[00:14:03.061 --> 00:14:03.881]  They're really scary.
[00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:05.442]  The media spends them as good.
[00:14:05.462 --> 00:14:09.223]  We have got just so much important stuff today.
[00:14:09.243 --> 00:14:10.284]  I had a bunch of big guests.
[00:14:10.324 --> 00:14:15.005]  Jesse Ventura is on in the third hour today on the day of the 9 to host the fourth hour.
[00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:20.628]  But Roger Stone of StoneZone.com, bestselling author, joins us.
[00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.052]  Let's just be honest about what we saw last night.
[00:14:24.973 --> 00:14:28.495]  I've never seen such a unified attack.
[00:14:28.555 --> 00:14:33.059]  It was like Julius Caesar being stabbed in the Senate by 15 senators.
[00:14:33.139 --> 00:14:36.202]  It was just the desperate hate of the establishment.
[00:14:36.822 --> 00:14:44.068]  Not that Trump's even perfect, but because the establishment's in control, they've hijacked things, and someone is coming upon their quarry.
[00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:50.277]  Like a group of hyenas, and they just think Trump maybe wants to, you know, take over their kill.
[00:14:51.078 --> 00:14:52.520]  They don't even probably think he's good.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:58.367]  But the spinning, the twisting, I have never seen anything one-tenth as insane.
[00:14:59.369 --> 00:15:00.510]  Will this backfire?
[00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:01.692]  This new height?
[00:15:03.614 --> 00:15:06.496]  Or did they actually wound Trump as some are spinning?
[00:15:07.036 --> 00:15:08.137]  And then I ask this question.
[00:15:08.177 --> 00:15:14.001]  If they're willing to do this in their arrogance and be this naked, maybe they'll blow his head off on live TV.
[00:15:14.061 --> 00:15:17.343]  I mean, I hate to talk like that, but these people are entitled.
[00:15:17.803 --> 00:15:19.004]  They're brazen stone.
[00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:20.025]  I don't know if you agree with me.
[00:15:21.005 --> 00:15:22.046]  Tell me your expert opinion.
[00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:25.653]  Well, that was an attempted mugging last night.
[00:15:25.973 --> 00:15:34.921]  Look, the Republican establishment, the Washington insiders, particularly the lobbyist class, have woken up and realized that there's a revolution.
[00:15:34.941 --> 00:15:40.946]  They wrote Trump off earlier, and that was an enormous mistake because he's gained
[00:15:42.373 --> 00:15:45.194]  He's running the table on the primaries.
[00:15:45.854 --> 00:15:50.316]  At least two campaigns now openly plotting a steal at the convention.
[00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:53.557]  Voter fraud in Texas.
[00:15:54.538 --> 00:15:59.299]  I'm now concerned about voter fraud in Florida, which is known for voter fraud, as you know.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:08.343]  And Ohio, where we have numerous complaints of irregularities in the absentee balloting and early voting process.
[00:16:08.883 --> 00:16:10.304]  And I think here's where we are, Alex.
[00:16:10.364 --> 00:16:13.105]  We have a key date moving up on us quickly.
[00:16:13.545 --> 00:16:14.365]  March 15th.
[00:16:15.006 --> 00:16:16.126]  Ohio and Florida.
[00:16:16.566 --> 00:16:17.587]  Trump wins both.
[00:16:17.987 --> 00:16:19.288]  He is the certain nominee.
[00:16:19.748 --> 00:16:21.168]  Trump wins one of the two.
[00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:24.830]  He is the probable nominee.
[00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:26.551]  Which I don't anticipate.
[00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:31.273]  You're looking at a brokered convention and a Mitt Romney nomination.
[00:16:33.308 --> 00:16:35.910]  Now, Mr. Stone, your time's breaking up.
[00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:49.441]  We're going to go back to you here in just a moment to repeat that, but for folks that haven't been following this, you know, we have you on once six months ago, and then two months later, and then a month later, and then, you know, every week, and then every day, and I appreciate your time.
[00:16:49.461 --> 00:16:51.002]  I know you've got a lot of meetings and things to do.
[00:16:52.062 --> 00:16:55.907]  But, the reason I'm having you on so much is everything you've been saying has been coming true.
[00:16:56.447 --> 00:17:06.599]  I mean, the people thought a few weeks ago that was nuts when you said they're getting Romney ready and, you know, they're gonna say they're gonna broker a convention openly and they're gonna try to shave votes so they don't get 50% going into the convention so they can challenge it.
[00:17:06.899 --> 00:17:08.581]  Now they admit that's their plan.
[00:17:08.922 --> 00:17:10.644]  So, tell us what's coming next.
[00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:14.041]  Well, these two primaries are pivotal.
[00:17:14.462 --> 00:17:17.602]  I'm very concerned about voter irregularities and fraud.
[00:17:17.962 --> 00:17:22.043]  I think it is essential that Trump win both Ohio and Florida.
[00:17:22.544 --> 00:17:28.025]  As I said, you may not have gotten because I think the NSA is working with our transmission here.
[00:17:28.765 --> 00:17:31.586]  I do think if Trump wins both Ohio and Florida on March 15th,
[00:17:32.546 --> 00:17:33.626]  He's a certain nominee.
[00:17:33.727 --> 00:17:36.928]  If he wins one of the two, he's the probable nominee.
[00:17:37.388 --> 00:17:42.790]  And should he lose both, which I don't anticipate, then we'll get ready for the big steal.
[00:17:43.491 --> 00:17:46.192]  This morning I sent a second team out to Ohio.
[00:17:46.672 --> 00:17:51.554]  Now in the Cincinnati area we have complaints about irregularities and absentee balloting.
[00:17:51.974 --> 00:17:56.136]  We're still looking at Texas where I'm convinced that Karl Rove was in the house.
[00:17:56.676 --> 00:18:06.967]  We have over 600 complaints now of citizens who voted for Donald Trump only to see their votes tallied for another candidate, overwhelmingly Marco Rubio.
[00:18:07.768 --> 00:18:10.831]  I fear the same kind of shenanigans here in Florida.
[00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:14.836]  Should we get him to come out and talk about that or will that make it look like shower grapes?
[00:18:16.001 --> 00:18:29.592]  No, I just think that first we have to ascertain what happened, we have to document it, and then if we have to take legal action to return some of these bogus results, or results at this point we suspect to be bogus, we will do so.
[00:18:29.672 --> 00:18:33.194]  But it shows you the extent to which the establishment will go.
[00:18:33.214 --> 00:18:41.101]  Alex, here in Florida, you cannot turn on the television or the radio without getting an anti-Donald Trump ad.
[00:18:42.141 --> 00:18:50.584]  They're spending, in Florida alone, the estimate is $40 million in negative advertising from various entities.
[00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:53.785]  And is this all just because he's never run with these guys?
[00:18:55.546 --> 00:18:57.067]  Or is it really his policies?
[00:18:57.127 --> 00:19:00.328]  Because, again, I've never seen such hysteria.
[00:19:01.008 --> 00:19:04.189]  I see the New York Times with a headline about America is scared of Trump.
[00:19:04.529 --> 00:19:06.990]  Psychologists say everyone's panicking.
[00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:08.831]  They're just trying to create a mindless
[00:19:09.551 --> 00:19:15.996]  Hysteria, because he says he's not going to let China have unfair trade deals, and wants us to have sovereignty, and wants to lower taxes.
[00:19:16.016 --> 00:19:18.058]  I mean, the guy sounds like JFK.
[00:19:18.698 --> 00:19:21.300]  How is this so alien to the establishment?
[00:19:22.961 --> 00:19:24.402]  Well, we've seen this playbook before.
[00:19:24.442 --> 00:19:26.644]  You maybe remember the full-page newspaper ads.
[00:19:27.285 --> 00:19:30.807]  1,000 psychiatrists say Barry Goldwater unfit to be president.
[00:19:30.847 --> 00:19:31.328]  Remember that?
[00:19:31.408 --> 00:19:31.788]  Oh, yes.
[00:19:32.849 --> 00:19:34.390]  This is the same playbook.
[00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.893]  Mitt Romney is merely doing what his father, George Romney, did.
[00:19:38.826 --> 00:19:39.947]  It's rule or ruin.
[00:19:39.987 --> 00:19:46.034]  In other words, if they cannot steal the nomination from Trump, they hope to make the nomination worthless.
[00:19:46.574 --> 00:19:52.681]  So they gave it to LBJ with the Goldwater situation, and now they're going to try to give it to Hillary.
[00:19:52.721 --> 00:20:00.269]  And they've said, we will give it to Hillary, we'll even wreck the party, because they've really just been blue-blood Democrats all along who took over the party and scuttled it with the Rockefellers.
[00:20:01.561 --> 00:20:03.782]  Well, I don't know that this is even ideological.
[00:20:03.802 --> 00:20:16.749]  I actually think the whole left-right divide is a Hegelian device that is used to distract us from the fact that there's a small circle of people running things who know no ideology other than money and power.
[00:20:16.829 --> 00:20:20.071]  This is the hijacker donor class, the special interest.
[00:20:20.331 --> 00:20:21.571]  Everybody says they don't want special interest.
[00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:28.055]  Here's the special interest, flooding billions of dollars, hissy-fitting, going insane, lying every dirty trick.
[00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:36.968]  I mean, even though I didn't like some of his answers last night, it doesn't even, at this point, it's so obvious if you're not for Trump, you're for the New World Order.
[00:20:37.008 --> 00:20:38.651]  I've never seen it more clear.
[00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:42.142]  I still think that Trump prevails for several reasons.
[00:20:42.462 --> 00:20:45.903]  One, he's probably the best communicator in the country at this point.
[00:20:46.243 --> 00:20:53.806]  Secondarily, this is a change of election and Hillary Clinton represents continuation of the failed policies that we have right now.
[00:20:54.306 --> 00:20:56.307]  Thirdly, he's running against Hillary Clinton.
[00:20:56.607 --> 00:20:57.187]  Enough said.
[00:20:57.728 --> 00:21:01.129]  Fourth, the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
[00:21:02.037 --> 00:21:06.060]  Additionally, don't think we can't move in on Bernie Sanders voters.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.261]  Those voters aren't hardcore socialists.
[00:21:08.682 --> 00:21:13.965]  They're just left-of-center voters who care as we do that the country's been hijacked by a Wall Street, D.C.
[00:21:14.025 --> 00:21:14.425]  cabal.
[00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:16.667]  Look at the other Democrat candidate that just dropped out.
[00:21:16.687 --> 00:21:17.828]  He's saying he's going to endorse Trump.
[00:21:18.368 --> 00:21:20.249]  Yes, Jim Webb, a good man, a patriot.
[00:21:20.569 --> 00:21:23.910]  So I still think that we have a revolution going here.
[00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.831]  They're trying to crush this revolution.
[00:21:27.472 --> 00:21:34.674]  And Romney is very definitely, as I said on this program, he's got the makeup on, he's suiting up, he's in the bullpen.
[00:21:34.895 --> 00:21:38.396]  He's waiting for Marco Rubio to fall flat on his face.
[00:21:38.596 --> 00:21:41.497]  If that doesn't happen, he'll endorse Rubio.
[00:21:41.857 --> 00:21:43.138]  If it does happen, look.
[00:21:44.593 --> 00:21:56.980]  Just so they can act like he got a few delegates so it's okay to steal the nomination.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.003]  And they're crazy enough, you think, to actually commit political harry-carry and do that.
[00:22:02.961 --> 00:22:03.782]  Well, exactly.
[00:22:03.802 --> 00:22:12.449]  Look, I think Romney understands nominating somebody who didn't receive a single delegate would not go over very well nationally and in the media and in the party.
[00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:15.771]  So he's getting in to try to rally some late delegates.
[00:22:16.452 --> 00:22:18.293]  They're going to play games in Florida.
[00:22:18.313 --> 00:22:19.314]  They're going to play games.
[00:22:19.735 --> 00:22:21.656]  I'm very worried about ballot security.
[00:22:21.896 --> 00:22:24.138]  I'm very worried about the big steal.
[00:22:25.159 --> 00:22:27.821]  If your listeners want to help, they can go to StopTheSteal.org.
[00:22:29.042 --> 00:22:36.105]  Well, we are assembling teams of election law experts and election lawyers and dispatching them to various places.
[00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:40.327]  While your sky's breaking up, I'm going to cut in here for a moment.
[00:22:40.488 --> 00:22:41.408]  Just cut up for a second.
[00:22:42.288 --> 00:22:44.209]  Roger Stone, is this how the steel goes?
[00:22:44.229 --> 00:22:45.310]  Because you can see him scripting it.
[00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.431]  Hey, I just came at the end because the American people demanded it.
[00:22:48.671 --> 00:22:52.793]  They'll put out a bunch of fake polls showing that Trump is going down.
[00:22:53.134 --> 00:22:55.555]  It'll be basically fake push polls and other garbage.
[00:22:56.295 --> 00:22:59.077]  Uh, they will then say, look, he won these late states.
[00:22:59.137 --> 00:23:01.439]  It's a referendum showing he's the guy.
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:07.404]  And the delegates have now flipped too because of, oh, the new scandal, whatever that is, the scandal du jour.
[00:23:07.644 --> 00:23:13.409]  They put out that time to create enough of a smoke screen where people kind of pause for a moment when they steal it.
[00:23:16.577 --> 00:23:19.638]  Is that correct, Roger?
[00:23:19.838 --> 00:23:21.479]  I think you got the gist of it, Alex.
[00:23:21.519 --> 00:23:38.545]  The most important thing to recognize is that while Trump is going to come very close and perhaps go over the top on the first ballot, on the second ballot there are many delegates who are no longer bound to him and the actual delegations have been packed with Trojan horses, with Quislings.
[00:23:39.045 --> 00:24:03.363]  So, they hope to just stall Trump short on the first ballot, get to the second ballot, and then you're going to see, they hope, a shift in some of these major delegations where Trump won the primary, where the people have spoken, where it's overwhelming, but the actual delegates are now free to vote their conscience, which means they're free to vote as they are directed by the party insiders and the party bosses.
[00:24:04.744 --> 00:24:07.125]  What if we got into another situation like you were in the middle of in 2000?
[00:24:09.127 --> 00:24:20.966]  Where there's a recount and the Supreme Court has to decide it, but it's a 4-4, a crisis in the court, then the President can do the nuclear option and emergency appoint the Supreme Court Justice that then picks the President.
[00:24:22.142 --> 00:24:42.927]  Boy, that is a doomsday scenario, but I must tell you, I put nothing beyond those who are apoplectic about the need to stop Trump because he's a nationalist, because he stands for American sovereignty, because he's asking hard questions about 9-11, about the origins of the Iraq War, about what's going on at the Fed.
[00:24:43.587 --> 00:24:47.248]  This is driving the establishment insane, absolutely insane.
[00:24:47.308 --> 00:24:50.289]  They are apoplectic, like nothing I have seen
[00:24:50.649 --> 00:24:51.149]  We're good to go.
[00:25:06.974 --> 00:25:08.074]  Stabs him last night.
[00:25:08.094 --> 00:25:10.055]  I don't think it's one of his better performances.
[00:25:10.095 --> 00:25:11.316]  He still did good in some areas.
[00:25:11.916 --> 00:25:17.098]  Does this damage him by them appearing to make it look like he flip-flopped when he was just being honest?
[00:25:18.018 --> 00:25:27.842]  I mean, he wasn't even defending himself, like, I endorsed Romney, I gave ten times the money, literally, to Romney, but she was still a senator, and so I have businesses there, and I'd basically give to both the senators.
[00:25:28.142 --> 00:25:31.543]  So yes, I did, and to her foundation, which I didn't know she was going to steal the money.
[00:25:31.743 --> 00:25:32.643]  His previous answers.
[00:25:32.843 --> 00:25:33.784]  He could just sit there
[00:25:34.284 --> 00:25:35.725]  And would just let them stab him.
[00:25:36.326 --> 00:25:37.266]  I was a little disappointed.
[00:25:38.487 --> 00:25:42.490]  Well, look, I think he held his own, but it was, you know, five on one.
[00:25:43.511 --> 00:25:45.492]  And he's a brawler.
[00:25:45.512 --> 00:25:46.933]  He more than held his own.
[00:25:46.973 --> 00:25:52.157]  Look, I'm not concerned about them taking the steam out of the revolution in terms of the nomination.
[00:25:52.197 --> 00:25:55.980]  Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee because he has overwhelming power.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.901]  Sure, but they hate him so much.
[00:25:57.961 --> 00:25:58.381]  It's clear.
[00:25:58.462 --> 00:25:59.482]  I mean, they're not going to stop.
[00:25:59.502 --> 00:26:00.163]  So what do you expect?
[00:26:00.663 --> 00:26:02.944]  It's the general election that I am concerned about.
[00:26:03.084 --> 00:26:10.365]  It is the fact that you've got Republican governors, like in Massachusetts, now suddenly saying, I won't vote for Donald Trump.
[00:26:10.405 --> 00:26:11.525]  We've seen this playbook.
[00:26:11.565 --> 00:26:12.926]  The Donald Trump movement.
[00:26:13.126 --> 00:26:14.366]  Point O is what it is.
[00:26:14.746 --> 00:26:14.926]  Yeah.
[00:26:15.826 --> 00:26:16.006]  All right.
[00:26:16.146 --> 00:26:16.766]  Other points.
[00:26:16.826 --> 00:26:20.067]  What do you make of Gingrich coming out and saying he's not part of the secret society?
[00:26:20.467 --> 00:26:23.728]  That is just an amazing statement.
[00:26:24.755 --> 00:26:32.859]  Well, Newt Gingrich is a good friend of mine, and frankly, last night it occurred to me what I really like is the idea of a Trump-Gingrich ticket.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.040]  There is a ticket.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:38.182]  You need somebody who knows how Washington works, but isn't part of the machine.
[00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:40.343]  He is the obvious guy to me.
[00:26:40.403 --> 00:26:49.348]  Now, I've never discussed this with Donald Trump, and as I've told you previously, although we talk from time to time, those conversations are proprietary.
[00:26:49.508 --> 00:26:53.811]  I would never divulge personal private conversations, but I do know this.
[00:26:54.491 --> 00:26:56.934]  Donald Trump has a very high regard for Newt Gingrich.
[00:26:56.974 --> 00:26:57.794]  They are friends.
[00:26:58.495 --> 00:27:03.400]  They met substantially in between the last presidential campaign and this one.
[00:27:03.841 --> 00:27:05.222]  That may be the ticket.
[00:27:05.803 --> 00:27:08.285]  And I think it would go over well with the American people.
[00:27:08.686 --> 00:27:10.027]  Well, here's the problem.
[00:27:10.067 --> 00:27:16.414]  And obviously Trump, so the real global elite down the left has to probably make some deals like Reagan did at the convention or get shot.
[00:27:17.452 --> 00:27:19.354]  But Gingrich is a globalist.
[00:27:19.414 --> 00:27:20.695]  I know you're a big DC insider.
[00:27:20.715 --> 00:27:21.676]  You've written books about it.
[00:27:22.097 --> 00:27:25.700]  You know some of the things he wrote in Alvin and Heidi Toffler's forwards of their books.
[00:27:26.321 --> 00:27:29.103]  But it is good that he's saying, hey, Trump or Hillary, he's being honest.
[00:27:29.143 --> 00:27:30.725]  So I appreciate that.
[00:27:31.406 --> 00:27:33.388]  But what about the one thing I'm concerned about?
[00:27:34.168 --> 00:27:34.628]  I don't
[00:27:54.761 --> 00:27:58.723]  MSNBC also said in the debate that that's one of his advisors.
[00:27:58.763 --> 00:28:00.904]  So I'm really concerned with the Patriot base.
[00:28:01.304 --> 00:28:02.105]  That's scaring him.
[00:28:02.145 --> 00:28:04.986]  It's one thing that scares him about Cruz.
[00:28:05.006 --> 00:28:05.646]  What do you say to that?
[00:28:06.467 --> 00:28:07.647]  Yeah, this was news to me.
[00:28:07.687 --> 00:28:12.129]  I must tell you, I've never heard his name previously within the Trump circles.
[00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:14.010]  I didn't know that there was an association.
[00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:19.752]  I do know that Trump is a strong nationalist, so it's somewhat surprising.
[00:28:19.833 --> 00:28:22.714]  Alex, I need to research that and tell you more when I learn more.
[00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:25.856]  Well, plus Trump, you know, they're saying, put out all your policies now.
[00:28:25.956 --> 00:28:27.337]  So they're like, well, who are top guys?
[00:28:27.377 --> 00:28:28.657]  And they're like, this is a guy.
[00:28:28.697 --> 00:28:34.421]  I mean, that's what I, in fact, I looked up Trump and Haas, and I think I've seen one thing where they had dinner at some gala years ago.
[00:28:34.861 --> 00:28:38.363]  So this is, this sounds to me like it's a crash course in some of this.
[00:28:38.423 --> 00:28:48.710]  I do know this, that Donald was very enamored of the writings of John Lenczowski, who was a top State Department official in the Reagan administration.
[00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.411]  Not a neocon.
[00:28:50.451 --> 00:28:50.711]  That's right.
[00:28:50.731 --> 00:28:51.692]  He mentioned him as well.
[00:28:52.881 --> 00:28:55.163]  Not a globalist.
[00:28:55.183 --> 00:28:57.286]  So, this is something that I have to get into a bit more.
[00:28:57.786 --> 00:28:59.208]  Well, here's all I know.
[00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:03.762]  I don't mindlessly just commit to somebody, but I'm proud of supporting Trump.
[00:29:03.782 --> 00:29:04.442]  He's a maverick.
[00:29:04.682 --> 00:29:05.602]  He's the tip of the spear.
[00:29:05.622 --> 00:29:07.283]  He's the representation of populism.
[00:29:07.703 --> 00:29:10.343]  We know the enemies that have already captured the country hate him.
[00:29:11.204 --> 00:29:15.305]  And so it would be a psychotic hundred to one gamble to go against him.
[00:29:16.585 --> 00:29:19.346]  And I mean, I think the odds are in favor.
[00:29:19.666 --> 00:29:20.926]  Two to one to go with Trump.
[00:29:21.266 --> 00:29:21.826]  I'm committed.
[00:29:23.027 --> 00:29:27.688]  And he had to really do some bad stuff for me not to because despite questions,
[00:29:28.408 --> 00:29:31.478]  The attack by the power structure is the certification.
[00:29:31.539 --> 00:29:32.943]  It's the red badge of courage.
[00:29:33.425 --> 00:29:34.107]  22nd closing comment.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.961]  Alex, the next days will be pivotal.
[00:29:38.081 --> 00:29:39.881]  In politics, a day is a lifetime.
[00:29:40.421 --> 00:29:48.243]  I have never seen the velocity of attack, of hatred, that they are unloading on Trump here in Florida.
[00:29:48.283 --> 00:29:49.983]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:29:50.543 --> 00:29:52.824]  Whether or not it will work remains to be seen.
[00:29:52.844 --> 00:30:01.426]  I saw a poll yesterday from a guy with no axe to grind, an excellent pollster who I respect, who's not for one of these other candidates.
[00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:02.146]  Sir, tell us real quick.
[00:30:02.826 --> 00:30:08.748]  That was former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich explaining why the Republican establishment is so scared of Donald Trump.
[00:30:26.195 --> 00:30:36.842]  Gingrich would know about secret societies, given his affiliation with Bohemian Grove, although he could also be speaking of the Skull and Bones Club, which is notorious for its initiation rituals.
[00:30:37.142 --> 00:30:46.348]  So far, Trump has played the role of outsider and people are loving him for it, but he has held private briefings with some secret society types, like Richard Haass.
[00:30:46.488 --> 00:30:49.090]  Haass is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:53.773]  He's also a member of the influential Trilateral Commission and a Bilderberg attendee.
[00:30:54.093 --> 00:31:01.355]  Earlier this week, a number of prominent neocons released an open letter stating their opposition to the candidacy of Donald Trump.
[00:31:01.656 --> 00:31:03.236]  Haas did not sign the letter.
[00:31:03.416 --> 00:31:06.257]  Could Richard Haas be one of Trump's potential cabinet picks?

[00:33:34.861 --> 00:33:36.281]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:40.109 --> 00:33:42.070]  Yeah, I'll be completely honest with the audience.
[00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:43.190]  That's what I always do.
[00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:45.771]  Quite frankly, to a neurotic level.
[00:33:46.891 --> 00:33:51.873]  I'm more truthful on air than I even am with my family in private.
[00:33:53.173 --> 00:33:53.913]  Just being honest.
[00:33:53.933 --> 00:33:58.395]  It's just such an important office that I'm in of being a truth teller.
[00:33:58.415 --> 00:34:04.877]  Because you know, with family, you won't tell them what you really think about food or where they want to go on vacation.
[00:34:04.897 --> 00:34:05.997]  You don't want to stir stuff up.
[00:34:08.786 --> 00:34:09.907]  Sometimes you just play along.
[00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:16.072]  I'm sitting around at a family reunion, people are saying stuff I disagree with at the table, I just ignore it.
[00:34:17.474 --> 00:34:20.496]  Sometimes I even catch myself going, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.
[00:34:20.516 --> 00:34:25.601]  And then I say, man, you're being lazy, you should argue with them.
[00:34:27.122 --> 00:34:30.705]  But when it comes to being on air, I just have to tell you the truth.
[00:34:33.828 --> 00:34:36.310]  I've talked to a lot of people that have known Donald Trump for years.
[00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:45.213]  And he is a narcissistic egomaniac.
[00:34:47.934 --> 00:34:55.519]  Now, in modern terms, people use the word narcissist like it's a bad thing.
[00:34:57.293 --> 00:35:12.880]  And they also throw it around because they're not even versed in the basics of Western psychology, which itself is obviously an imperfect system and lens, but something to see the world through and very effective.
[00:35:15.981 --> 00:35:17.222]  Donald Trump is an alpha male.
[00:35:18.643 --> 00:35:19.803]  Donald Trump is confident.
[00:35:21.004 --> 00:35:22.104]  Donald Trump is aggressive.
[00:35:22.144 --> 00:35:23.305]  Donald Trump likes to fight.
[00:35:24.252 --> 00:35:26.893]  Donald Trump likes to succeed.
[00:35:28.394 --> 00:35:30.775]  They have taken those traits and made them negative.
[00:35:31.675 --> 00:35:42.840]  If you want to succeed at the loss of others, just because you like to see people hurt, if you don't like to see other people successful, then you're a predatory scumbag.
[00:35:44.481 --> 00:35:50.644]  If you're the type of narcissist that, you know, doesn't give people a tip when they give you good service, who enjoys putting down little people,
[00:35:53.254 --> 00:35:55.056]  Or who enjoys thinking you're better than everybody?
[00:35:56.017 --> 00:35:59.100]  Well, that's the modern, what we think of a narcissist.
[00:36:01.181 --> 00:36:09.469]  But when you're really confident and have a vision of yourself as being successful and building up a country, that's just called confidence and leadership.
[00:36:13.073 --> 00:36:15.155]  And it's good to have manias.
[00:36:16.658 --> 00:36:27.943]  Sure, you can be an extreme maniac and just be totally wild and go compulsively gamble until everything you got's gone, or, you know, go out and be a sex maniac, you know, who runs around with ten partners a day or whatever.
[00:36:28.703 --> 00:36:30.344]  That's the bad end of being a maniac.
[00:36:30.384 --> 00:36:33.846]  Or you can be a maniac sculptor, or painter, or composer.
[00:36:33.886 --> 00:36:38.548]  I mean, most top composers have like 170 IQs and they are maniacs.
[00:36:38.888 --> 00:36:40.509]  I don't care if they're Japanese or German.
[00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:46.494]  I don't care if they're Mexican or South African, they bounce off the walls.
[00:36:49.436 --> 00:36:50.856]  I've seen documentaries about it.
[00:36:50.896 --> 00:36:52.077]  They're all pretty much the same.
[00:36:54.958 --> 00:37:00.120]  Because the way they're tuned into music and movement, it's mathematics of the soul.
[00:37:01.661 --> 00:37:03.702]  So there's good maniacs and there's bad maniacs.
[00:37:04.941 --> 00:37:08.122]  And Trump really does want to see a prosperous country.
[00:37:08.322 --> 00:37:09.442]  He's based in the free market.
[00:37:09.462 --> 00:37:10.342]  He's based in service.
[00:37:11.022 --> 00:37:12.462]  He's based in real estate.
[00:37:12.982 --> 00:37:18.463]  He's not a modern globalist that's based in technocracies and centralized total control.
[00:37:21.764 --> 00:37:33.366]  And people like Gingrich and Haas reaching out to Trump, which they've done, is the real arm of the New World Order going, hey, you don't co-opt them being mean to them and bullying them.
[00:37:35.379 --> 00:37:42.023]  You come over and do bad cop, we're gonna do good cop, we're gonna bring Donald Trump in, you can't stop him.
[00:37:42.503 --> 00:37:49.327]  And that's the smart way to beat the Patriot movement, is to co-op Trump without him ever knowing it happened.
[00:37:56.932 --> 00:38:00.434]  Or he won't understand who they are, and when he endorses them,
[00:38:02.645 --> 00:38:03.786]  That will then hurt Trump.
[00:38:03.806 --> 00:38:06.248]  Because I've always said, the only way to stop Trump is to endorse him.
[00:38:06.649 --> 00:38:09.812]  But the system is so arrogant about themselves, they can't do it.
[00:38:10.152 --> 00:38:17.459]  Unless you get to a high-level manager point, like Newt Gingrich and Richard N. Haas, they're in on the national security meetings.
[00:38:17.919 --> 00:38:20.982]  They're in on the big honchoing.
[00:38:21.722 --> 00:38:23.104]  They're in on the whole plan.
[00:38:24.366 --> 00:38:26.667]  Just like Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller.
[00:38:26.927 --> 00:38:29.168]  And Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller are fading away.
[00:38:29.588 --> 00:38:31.009]  Brzezinski's still healthy and sharp.
[00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:35.651]  So it goes Brzezinski and then on down Stratos.
[00:38:35.691 --> 00:38:42.634]  But 30, 40, 50 people down there in the Western Anglo-American power structure sits Newt Gingrich.
[00:38:43.315 --> 00:38:45.576]  About 10 above him sits a Richard and Haas.
[00:38:46.116 --> 00:38:52.139]  Haas is one of the top 15 most powerful globalists in the world.
[00:38:53.103 --> 00:38:55.144]  He knows where the bodies are buried.
[00:38:55.204 --> 00:38:57.146]  He's in the loop for the whole show.
[00:38:57.166 --> 00:39:08.634]  And now we know Donald Trump's held briefing with Richard Haass, head of counsel on foreign relations.
[00:39:08.934 --> 00:39:17.260]  So they're coming to him and saying, look, buddy, all right, you ran over us, we got it.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:24.904]  Those little minions, Megyn Kelly and everybody you're fighting with, even Rupert Murdoch, they're not in on the big ball game, they do what we tell them.
[00:39:27.326 --> 00:39:30.788]  We tell them put out anti-family messages and global warming messages, they do it.
[00:39:32.229 --> 00:39:33.490]  We tell them attack you, they do it.
[00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:42.896]  But there's such an awakening happening that that's all going in your favor right now, but you're not gonna be allowed to have the presidency unless you play ball.
[00:39:44.837 --> 00:39:45.958]  And so I'll be honest with you,
[00:39:46.983 --> 00:39:50.404]  This is a very disturbing move.
[00:39:55.286 --> 00:39:56.887]  But it's one I would have expected.
[00:39:56.987 --> 00:39:59.408]  And I just need to know, does Trump know what's happening here?
[00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:06.051]  That's a question that I know will end up getting to him.
[00:40:08.452 --> 00:40:13.474]  And the question is, if he gets some globalists behind him, but still the main global power structure,
[00:40:14.898 --> 00:40:15.858]  Doesn't like Trump.
[00:40:16.238 --> 00:40:20.339]  Do you then ask yourself, well, maybe he's like Reagan playing along with him.
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.900]  Well, then they'll just shoot him like they shot Reagan.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.361]  But I'm sure not going to support Hillary.
[00:40:27.281 --> 00:40:34.283]  And that's why it's so important to get people elected at the state level who will block the globalist agenda and educate the public in general.
[00:40:34.803 --> 00:40:36.743]  But that's the epic moment we've reached right now.
[00:40:36.763 --> 00:40:39.184]  I'm going to be going over all this and go to the highlights and the rest of it.
[00:40:40.464 --> 00:40:43.525]  Separately, I was critical of the Bundys.
[00:40:45.157 --> 00:40:49.859]  Some of the people in the first part of the siege out in Southern Nevada that were trying to provocateur things.
[00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:59.244]  But I supported overall the idea of land rights and people peacefully standing up and not having the feds aim guns at people saying we'll shoot reporters.
[00:41:00.304 --> 00:41:03.806]  But then I was really critical of what unfolded out in Oregon.
[00:41:05.527 --> 00:41:07.848]  And it's gone the way I thought it would, but now even worse.
[00:41:07.908 --> 00:41:11.450]  They have arrested, it's got to be 60-something people now, and
[00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:20.958]  They arrested 12 people in six states yesterday for taking photos of the feds.
[00:41:21.598 --> 00:41:23.660]  David Bundy, people like that.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.801]  They're trying to tie it to Trump.
[00:41:24.922 --> 00:41:28.845]  One of them was the head of a veterans group in New Hampshire for Trump, an unofficial group.
[00:41:28.865 --> 00:41:29.686]  The media's running with that.
[00:41:30.427 --> 00:41:32.529]  And they're branding it as, here are the new American terrorists.
[00:41:32.549 --> 00:41:35.172]  They wear cowboy hats and they have American flex.
[00:41:41.889 --> 00:41:44.690]  And it was 12 this morning, now it's 18 others indicted.
[00:41:53.734 --> 00:41:56.235]  So we're gonna be going over that too some in the next hour.
[00:41:56.315 --> 00:42:07.080]  We've got the Northeast Intelligence Network head joining us, and I'll be honest, eight, nine years ago, I would hear Doug Hagman
[00:42:08.769 --> 00:42:10.213]  On Coast to Coast AM with George Norian.
[00:42:10.233 --> 00:42:15.066]  I thought he was really smart on some things, but I thought he was exaggerating or putting out just propaganda on others.
[00:42:19.889 --> 00:42:21.310]  Where he said they're going to flood the U.S.
[00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:29.793]  with radical jihadists to try to bring in Sharia law, and they're going to flood Europe, and Obama's really a closet Muslim, and I have this from the FBI, and all the rest of it.
[00:42:30.293 --> 00:42:33.774]  I know the guy does teach law enforcement groups, state police, even the feds.
[00:42:33.834 --> 00:42:38.576]  I know he's a respected private detective and law enforcement trainer with scores of certificates.
[00:42:38.997 --> 00:42:41.097]  But I just thought, that is crazy, that's not going to happen.
[00:42:41.337 --> 00:42:43.138]  I mean, I heard him saying it before Glenn Beck was saying it.
[00:42:43.398 --> 00:42:45.059]  And I've said Glenn Beck was right about that, and I was wrong.
[00:42:46.423 --> 00:42:50.647]  And they really have done it, and he really does have these contacts, and he's right.
[00:42:51.728 --> 00:42:55.672]  And he's got a whole bunch of just over-the-top stuff to talk about, and I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:42:55.732 --> 00:42:58.836]  I mean, it's just, what type of crazies do we have running this government?
[00:43:00.297 --> 00:43:07.484]  I have a stack of people beating folks up, stabbing them, killing people, you name it, in Europe, trying to enforce surreal law on the streets.
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:17.124]  They already banned Oktoberfest in a bunch of German cities because the Muslims would come out and attack people because they didn't like seeing women with cold beer handing out big mugs.
[00:43:17.204 --> 00:43:19.786]  I mean, can't we have anything liberals?
[00:43:19.846 --> 00:43:20.966]  You're such filth!
[00:43:21.787 --> 00:43:29.491]  You hate freedom so much, you bring in the weirdest, freakiest people to bully everybody and then we have to submit to them so they don't get upset.
[00:43:30.499 --> 00:43:32.181]  I just, it's just, it's just crazy.
[00:43:32.201 --> 00:43:35.245]  And then the feds want to persecute a bunch of ranchers.
[00:43:35.726 --> 00:43:38.269]  I know there were 50 something families, 30 in the area.
[00:43:38.529 --> 00:43:39.531]  You ran them all out.
[00:43:39.791 --> 00:43:41.033]  You took their grazing rights.
[00:43:41.914 --> 00:43:43.636]  And I guess one family stood up.
[00:43:44.077 --> 00:43:45.618]  And so boy, didn't you show them.
[00:43:48.806 --> 00:43:53.267]  The country really is run by people that hate private property, hate men, hate family.
[00:43:53.988 --> 00:43:55.308]  They all watch drama shows.
[00:43:55.328 --> 00:44:06.252]  All those feds that are involved watch the drama shows that mirror what they're supposed to be, where women run everything and men are bad and families are bad and they're arresting the patriots because they're all terrorists.
[00:44:06.932 --> 00:44:08.872]  It's just such a brainwashed narrative.
[00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:11.293]  I mean, can't people see it's all a fraud?
[00:44:13.014 --> 00:44:16.715]  Where they had video packages against Trump and graphics and the lights.
[00:44:17.799 --> 00:44:19.140]  I mean, I'm a TV guy, okay?
[00:44:20.081 --> 00:44:22.504]  I took RTF, but I've done it for 21 years.
[00:44:22.824 --> 00:44:23.685]  That's the real school.
[00:44:24.907 --> 00:44:27.009]  And it's annoying three, four hours under these lights.
[00:44:27.029 --> 00:44:28.671]  They're turned up medium.
[00:44:29.491 --> 00:44:32.915]  Trump was turned up with hot stage lights.
[00:44:32.955 --> 00:44:33.916]  I can see the color of them.
[00:44:34.677 --> 00:44:35.297]  They were yellow.
[00:44:35.858 --> 00:44:36.779]  The others were white light.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.362]  Kelly was perfectly lit.
[00:44:41.351 --> 00:44:43.992]  Like it was a, you know, ten million dollar porno scene.
[00:44:44.752 --> 00:44:46.653]  Megyn Kelly had the best lighting I've ever seen on a woman.
[00:44:46.913 --> 00:44:48.374]  She looked like some type of angel.
[00:44:48.634 --> 00:44:49.894]  Her eyes looked satanic, though.
[00:44:51.715 --> 00:44:54.296]  But I marveled at the feminimity of it and how they presented it.
[00:44:54.356 --> 00:44:59.578]  It was, it was... Don't tell me we weren't made by an awesome creator, making something like that.
[00:45:00.019 --> 00:45:01.159]  But the brain is rotten.
[00:45:01.639 --> 00:45:02.399]  The brain is ugly.
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:08.882]  So I'm not attracted to Megyn Kelly, but I, the way they had her dolled up, perfect, the whole nine yards, it clicked.
[00:45:09.162 --> 00:45:09.902]  She's hearing the wrong mic.
[00:45:09.922 --> 00:45:10.963]  She didn't look, it looks like a witch.
[00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.731]  And they had Trump under yellow hot lights.
[00:45:18.131 --> 00:45:19.172]  He cooked an egg on those.
[00:45:20.112 --> 00:45:20.992]  Blasting him.
[00:45:21.032 --> 00:45:26.755]  And people are wondering why he was squinting and why he was... And it's just his people, you know, he's running his own campaign.
[00:45:26.775 --> 00:45:27.895]  He thinks he knows everything.
[00:45:29.296 --> 00:45:31.117]  And Donald, I wouldn't tell you how to build a building.
[00:45:31.737 --> 00:45:34.718]  I wouldn't tell you how to, you know, pick up the most beautiful women or whatever.
[00:45:35.258 --> 00:45:39.960]  But buddy, you've been in TV production yourself and they hit you and hit you hard.
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.801]  And you were right not to go to the last one.
[00:45:42.181 --> 00:45:43.722]  They flame-throwed him.
[00:45:45.486 --> 00:45:46.687]  Maybe we should pull up some of the footage.
[00:45:46.707 --> 00:45:48.047]  They flamethrowered him.
[00:45:49.148 --> 00:45:50.288]  And by the way, that's a tactic.
[00:45:50.328 --> 00:45:52.029]  I was talking to a former Nightline producer.
[00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:54.731]  He said, oh yeah, we used to get the militias and stuff in to be interviewed.
[00:45:55.271 --> 00:45:58.232]  We'd have the presenter here and we'd turn the lights up super high power.
[00:45:58.252 --> 00:46:00.513]  And that's why people would look almost, almost white.
[00:46:01.174 --> 00:46:02.154]  And they were doing it to Trump.
[00:46:02.234 --> 00:46:04.696]  I mean, they were basically light boarding him last night.
[00:46:10.518 --> 00:46:13.080]  That's why cops will turn the lights up real bright, you know, to get you to break.
[00:46:14.136 --> 00:46:16.857]  It's a subtle form of psychological warfare, torture.
[00:46:19.018 --> 00:46:21.499]  Doesn't work as good as a phone book upside the head, but it'll do.
[00:46:22.659 --> 00:46:30.682]  Now, we're gonna be getting into all that, but Gawker, I tweeted this last night, and Gawker's written so much bull about me and the rest of it.
[00:46:30.722 --> 00:46:33.643]  I mean, it's usually a comedy act, but Gawker got it right.
[00:46:34.744 --> 00:46:36.284]  Alex Perini.
[00:46:38.085 --> 00:46:40.826]  Donald Trump was set up, and then it just goes through the whole setup.
[00:46:40.866 --> 00:46:43.167]  I'm gonna get to that in a moment, and these clips, but first,
[00:46:44.628 --> 00:46:47.090]  You know there's a flash sale that is going to end Sunday.
[00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:48.210]  It's over Sunday.
[00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:50.732]  It's the best sale we've ever done on colloidal silver.
[00:46:51.372 --> 00:46:55.875]  We've done the same sale once before, but it's the biggest discount that we ever offer.
[00:46:56.475 --> 00:46:57.416]  It's 50% off.
[00:46:57.456 --> 00:46:58.436]  It's already the lowest price.
[00:46:58.837 --> 00:47:00.117]  What an amazing antibiotic.
[00:47:00.157 --> 00:47:02.219]  What an amazing topical, but also can be ingested.
[00:47:02.639 --> 00:47:03.379]  Read the literature.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.342]  It's 30 parts per million, the strongest that the FDA allows.
[00:47:08.743 --> 00:47:09.843]  And I personally agree with it.
[00:47:10.003 --> 00:47:11.144]  We've talked to doctors and others.
[00:47:11.184 --> 00:47:12.425]  Going past that, it gets dangerous.
[00:47:15.324 --> 00:47:33.208]  I personally, two years ago, had a lung infection that killed my uncle, killed Buckley's dad, a super patriot, great shape he was in, and I was on two rounds of antibiotics, and I'd taken a little bit of chlorosilver, it didn't work.
[00:47:33.628 --> 00:47:35.568]  I guzzled three bottles over a week, it was just gone.
[00:47:41.095 --> 00:47:44.618]  50% off, and I mean, I'm not gonna say silver's good to kill things, it's just known.
[00:47:44.658 --> 00:47:47.601]  You go to even CVS now and they have whole aisles of silver.
[00:47:47.901 --> 00:47:50.743]  Five years ago it wasn't that case, but they're not colloidal for whatever reason.
[00:47:51.764 --> 00:47:53.365]  It needs to be micro-sized, folks.
[00:47:53.926 --> 00:47:57.448]  Flash sale, get Silver Bullet for 50% off at m4warslife.com.
[00:47:58.929 --> 00:48:00.230]  And here's really the big one.
[00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:05.595]  You owe it to yourself, folks, to go to m4warslife.com and go to the liver cleanse, gallbladder cleanse page.
[00:48:06.971 --> 00:48:07.793]  With a liver shield.
[00:48:08.434 --> 00:48:11.740]  Because we have that in stock and it's excellent and it's hard to keep in stock.
[00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:14.546]  You do the six day cleanse or just take it daily.
[00:48:14.946 --> 00:48:17.211]  You heard Roger Stone say he loves it and he's a big health guy.
[00:48:18.243 --> 00:48:19.063]  I know he's a bodybuilder.
[00:48:19.083 --> 00:48:19.723]  I looked it up online.
[00:48:19.744 --> 00:48:21.024]  That guy's in pretty good shape for his age.
[00:48:21.984 --> 00:48:26.886]  But get LiverShield at Infowarsandlife.com and start cleansing your body of toxic compounds.
[00:48:27.666 --> 00:48:31.587]  We keep selling out of LiverShield with every new run for months and for good reason.
[00:48:32.007 --> 00:48:35.669]  You've heard my personal liver flush story using LiverShield and the results were dramatic.
[00:48:36.009 --> 00:48:42.691]  LiverShield uses powerful blend of organic and well-crafted herbs specifically formulated to support natural function and detoxification of liver and gallbladder.
[00:48:43.211 --> 00:48:44.532]  Here is a comment by Eva B. in Sacramento, California.
[00:48:44.572 --> 00:48:45.032]  Liver cleanse.
[00:48:45.052 --> 00:48:48.135]  I follow a liver cleanse diet and I definitely have more energy and feel clean inside and out.
[00:48:48.155 --> 00:48:49.416]  This changed my diet forever.
[00:49:07.915 --> 00:49:09.436]  Here's Rebecca in Denver, Colorado.
[00:49:09.516 --> 00:49:10.717]  I'm 33 years old, female.
[00:49:11.077 --> 00:49:12.238]  Best liver cleanse I've done.
[00:49:12.859 --> 00:49:16.081]  Green, lima bean, colored stones came out of my body.
[00:49:16.462 --> 00:49:17.342]  That means you're healthier.
[00:49:17.743 --> 00:49:18.183]  Black ones.
[00:49:19.244 --> 00:49:20.965]  I'm in the middle of my second cleanse plan.
[00:49:20.985 --> 00:49:23.427]  I'm doing this cleanse every three months.
[00:49:23.487 --> 00:49:24.488]  Recommended to everyone.
[00:49:24.508 --> 00:49:28.191]  And I'm even organizing group cleanses with people at work and with friends.
[00:49:28.231 --> 00:49:32.174]  Yeah, people all over third-party sites are saying the best liver cleanse and gallbladder cleanse ever.
[00:49:34.141 --> 00:49:40.222]  That's available in 4WarsLife.com and 4WarsStore.com has a Hillary for Prison shirts to exercise your free speech or lose it.
[00:49:40.723 --> 00:49:48.764]  Anthroplex, amazing male and female libido, energy, estrogen blocker, you name it, from the research groups done.
[00:49:49.044 --> 00:49:49.965]  All I know is it works.
[00:49:50.045 --> 00:49:51.565]  It turns me into a tyrannosaurus.
[00:49:51.965 --> 00:49:54.946]  Quote Jesse Ventura, I'm a sexual tyrannosaurus.
[00:49:55.686 --> 00:49:56.186]  Whatever.
[00:49:56.546 --> 00:49:58.487]  I'm a maniac and I certainly feel it.
[00:49:58.807 --> 00:49:59.708]  Try it for yourself.
[00:49:59.788 --> 00:50:00.808]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:50:00.848 --> 00:50:01.609]  It's back in stock.

[00:50:12.554 --> 00:50:13.594]  SwimForwardsLife.com.
[00:50:15.375 --> 00:50:17.316]  I want to go out to break because it says it all.
[00:50:17.336 --> 00:50:21.338]  Newt Gingrich wanting to get credibility as a top globalist gopher.
[00:50:24.028 --> 00:50:29.051]  Coming out and talking about secret societies running things and saying Donald Trump isn't part of secret societies.
[00:50:29.591 --> 00:50:32.773]  You may try to act like you're an Alex Jones, old Gingrich, but you're not.
[00:50:33.713 --> 00:50:38.816]  And people know that, but this is a very disturbing development and shows Trump has entered the true danger zone.
[00:50:38.836 --> 00:50:41.758]  Let's go out to break with top globalist Newt Gingrich.
[00:50:43.158 --> 00:50:49.422]  And now they're faced with a very real prospect of Donald Trump becoming the leader of the party and it absolutely drives them crazy.
[00:50:49.921 --> 00:50:50.061]  Why?
[00:50:50.101 --> 00:50:50.622]  We'll be back.
[00:50:50.642 --> 00:50:51.322]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:52:15.085 --> 00:52:15.586]  It's true.
[00:52:15.706 --> 00:52:19.652]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[00:52:19.853 --> 00:52:21.715]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[00:52:22.256 --> 00:52:26.743]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:41.451]  Attention, citizens.
[00:53:41.671 --> 00:53:47.515]  This man has received national attention for accurately predicting every major financial trend, including the market crash of 2008.
[00:53:47.795 --> 00:53:57.802]  His name is Harry Dent, and in his newly released book, he is making even bigger and bolder predictions that have the potential to devastate the world economy and your personal wealth.

[00:54:06.809 --> 00:54:09.531]  Again, that's www.harrydentresearch.com.
[00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:21.552]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:54:21.632 --> 00:54:23.774]  Over 90% of modern war is information warfare.
[00:54:23.914 --> 00:54:29.459]  I am your host Alex Jones, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:54:45.165 --> 00:54:48.868]  We have a ton of clips, a bunch of guests joining us here on the broadcast.
[00:54:49.908 --> 00:54:52.690]  I also want to take your phone calls.
[00:54:53.651 --> 00:54:57.894]  On the debate last night, it was just so incredible.
[00:54:57.914 --> 00:54:57.954]  800-259-9231.
[00:54:57.974 --> 00:54:58.014]  800-259-9231.
[00:54:58.074 --> 00:54:59.936]  What do you think of Gingrich coming out for Trump?
[00:54:59.976 --> 00:55:01.717]  What do you think of him meeting with the CFR?
[00:55:13.831 --> 00:55:15.191]  What do you think happens at that level?
[00:55:16.791 --> 00:55:19.232]  I would have to see what happened when he got in office if he delivered.
[00:55:22.773 --> 00:55:25.633]  Then why are they so scared of him then if they think he'll just sell out?
[00:55:28.814 --> 00:55:30.634]  See, that makes me want to support Trump.
[00:55:31.354 --> 00:55:34.334]  I can't support Hillary, but at the same time, it's all troubling.
[00:55:35.475 --> 00:55:37.615]  But what would you do at that level when they reach out to you?
[00:55:38.475 --> 00:55:39.435]  What are you supposed to do?
[00:55:40.856 --> 00:55:41.916]  I pretty much meet with anybody.
[00:55:42.556 --> 00:55:43.016]  I've met with
[00:55:44.349 --> 00:55:45.830]  I've had the head of the orchestra group on.
[00:55:46.391 --> 00:55:48.753]  They thought they'd come on, be nice to me, invite me up to New York.
[00:55:48.793 --> 00:55:49.573]  He did during the break.
[00:55:50.634 --> 00:55:51.235]  Harmon heard it.
[00:55:51.975 --> 00:55:55.458]  When I wasn't nice to him on air, he said, I just thought you were smart, Alex.
[00:55:56.239 --> 00:55:57.760]  Oh, you thought I was smart.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.221]  I could play patty cake with you.
[00:56:02.124 --> 00:56:03.525]  I'm not selling out to these people.
[00:56:05.246 --> 00:56:06.968]  Because you can't sell out to death.
[00:56:07.844 --> 00:56:09.205]  You can't sell out to eugenics.
[00:56:10.086 --> 00:56:16.410]  If my family was getting threatened, the public's dumbed down and wouldn't do anything, I'd stay out of the way of Boss Hogg.
[00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:18.091]  I don't have a death wish.
[00:56:18.792 --> 00:56:21.234]  This isn't Boss Hogg who just wants to run the show.
[00:56:22.555 --> 00:56:28.879]  They want total control over everything and destroy the human system and replace it with a new one.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.381]  I'm not signing on to that.
[00:56:32.262 --> 00:56:34.263]  See, it's not that I'm Mr. Goody Two-Shoes, folks.
[00:56:34.943 --> 00:56:36.845]  I know who the globalists are.
[00:56:38.953 --> 00:56:39.513]  They're death.
[00:56:40.874 --> 00:56:42.636]  You don't make deals with people like that.
[00:56:42.956 --> 00:56:50.802]  I'm not pig-headed, by the way, when it comes to compromise, if it's for the greater good, and if you can't beat somebody.
[00:56:52.203 --> 00:56:53.064]  I'm not a fatalist.
[00:56:53.124 --> 00:56:54.004]  I'm not here to lose.
[00:56:54.245 --> 00:56:54.805]  I want to win.
[00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:57.627]  But I'm not selling out the unborn.
[00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:59.449]  I'm not promoting devil worship.
[00:56:59.709 --> 00:57:01.130]  I'm not promoting the end of the family.
[00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:03.171]  I'm not promoting making people dumb and poor.
[00:57:03.452 --> 00:57:03.652]  No!
[00:57:03.972 --> 00:57:04.212]  Never!
[00:57:04.232 --> 00:57:04.753]  Never!
[00:57:05.413 --> 00:57:06.654]  I'm not promoting screwing people.
[00:57:06.974 --> 00:57:07.575]  Just not doing it.
[00:57:08.584 --> 00:57:14.766]  And if Donald Trump wants to empower America and the world and not have wars with Russia, to act like that's a horrible thing, I hear a lot of good stuff out of him.
[00:57:16.986 --> 00:57:18.047]  We'll see what happens, though.
[00:57:18.867 --> 00:57:20.967]  It's all very, very dangerous.
[00:57:20.987 --> 00:57:22.728]  This is an unprecedented time.
[00:57:22.748 --> 00:57:23.768]  We're at the sea change.
[00:57:23.788 --> 00:57:24.648]  We're at the crossroads.
[00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.829]  We're at the jump point.
[00:57:25.849 --> 00:57:26.649]  We're at the flashpoint.
[00:57:26.669 --> 00:57:27.569]  We're at the event horizon.
[00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:34.051]  Let's go to this two-minute mashup as we get ready to go to break.
[00:57:34.111 --> 00:57:35.071]  This is from the debate.
[00:57:35.431 --> 00:57:36.752]  Wall Street Journal did the spoil down.
[00:57:36.792 --> 00:57:37.072]  Here it is.
[00:57:38.499 --> 00:57:39.761]  He referred to my hands.
[00:57:39.841 --> 00:57:42.404]  If they're small, something else must be small.
[00:57:42.684 --> 00:57:44.406]  I guarantee you there's no problem.
[00:57:44.486 --> 00:57:45.167]  I guarantee it.
[00:57:46.088 --> 00:57:51.593]  Our campaign is the only campaign that over and over again has beaten Donald Trump to date.
[00:57:51.974 --> 00:57:54.436]  But he's getting beaten very, very badly.
[00:57:54.516 --> 00:57:55.637]  So where does this come from?
[00:57:56.037 --> 00:58:01.803]  It's now March Madness and we're heading up north to the place, to my turf, okay?
[00:58:02.043 --> 00:58:03.925]  I have a policy question for you, sir.
[00:58:04.005 --> 00:58:04.946]  Let's see if he answers it.
[00:58:05.286 --> 00:58:06.727]  Don't worry about it, little Marco.
[00:58:06.747 --> 00:58:07.268]  Gentlemen!
[00:58:07.408 --> 00:58:10.751]  Down in Florida, that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers.
[00:58:10.931 --> 00:58:13.473]  People don't want a short-term job.
[00:58:13.854 --> 00:58:14.514]  They don't want.
[00:58:14.574 --> 00:58:17.657]  So we will bring people in and we will send the people out.
[00:58:17.857 --> 00:58:23.482]  But when you have chances to help the American workers, you're making your clothes overseas and you're hiring your workers from overseas.
[00:58:32.051 --> 00:58:34.872]  It's a guest worker program for 90 days.
[00:58:34.932 --> 00:58:36.433]  That's what all these hotels use.
[00:58:36.993 --> 00:58:44.596]  Because the truth is, you can't get the skilled people that know how to run a hotel, who are locals who just want to work for 90 days, because they're college kids.
[00:58:45.257 --> 00:58:46.597]  It takes years of training.
[00:58:46.637 --> 00:58:50.059]  These are professionals that do it all over the world and choose the lifestyle.
[00:58:50.319 --> 00:58:52.760]  Again, they use the public's ignorance to make Trump look like a liar.
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:54.100]  Like the Hillary thing.
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:55.361]  He didn't support her for president.
[00:58:56.101 --> 00:58:58.822]  But Trump didn't defend himself.
[00:58:58.842 --> 00:58:59.403]  It was just crazy.
[00:59:00.894 --> 00:59:02.855]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[00:59:02.935 --> 00:59:03.975]  Try a bottle of it.
[00:59:04.155 --> 00:59:05.616]  Rob Dew joins us.
[00:59:05.756 --> 00:59:08.577]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[00:59:08.857 --> 00:59:09.918]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[00:59:09.938 --> 00:59:10.878]  I'd been working all day.
[00:59:10.898 --> 00:59:13.259]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[00:59:13.399 --> 00:59:14.379]  I get in here at 830.
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:16.440]  I was kind of run down.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:18.441]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[00:59:18.661 --> 00:59:20.522]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[00:59:20.542 --> 00:59:22.343]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[00:59:22.383 --> 00:59:23.143]  I popped two of them.
[00:59:23.423 --> 00:59:25.544]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[00:59:25.704 --> 00:59:27.485]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[00:59:27.505 --> 00:59:28.945]  It's got four and a half stars.
[00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:30.206]  People really love it.
[00:59:30.486 --> 00:59:31.006]  Read about it.
[00:59:31.086 --> 00:59:34.828]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[00:59:34.928 --> 00:59:40.190]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:44.273]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without BrainForce.
[00:59:44.413 --> 00:59:50.238]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more BrainForce and came in.
[00:59:50.578 --> 00:59:56.642]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:56.682 --> 00:59:58.904]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:13.644 --> 01:00:19.667]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:20.268 --> 01:00:23.309]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:33.735]  That debate was just a descent into an attempt to mug, bloodbath Donald Trump.
[01:00:34.836 --> 01:00:36.357]  Will that backfire on them?
[01:00:37.797 --> 01:00:42.198]  Or did they actually score some points, because he didn't defend himself on things like funding Hillary.
[01:00:42.558 --> 01:00:44.819]  He gave money to her Senate campaign and to her charity.
[01:00:45.799 --> 01:00:49.740]  He's pointed that out before, but he backed and gave ten times the money to Mitt Romney.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.920]  That's what those big billionaires do, to operate in those states.
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:55.441]  You give political contributions, or they come after you.
[01:00:56.461 --> 01:00:57.941]  He didn't give his old defense, that's true.
[01:00:59.862 --> 01:01:04.363]  And I'm not attacking Trump, I'm just saying the points where he had problems, I'm trying to show what happened here.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.303]  But still, everybody I talked to, people who don't even like Trump, said, yeah, they're out to get him.
[01:01:09.323 --> 01:01:10.024]  That was incredible.
[01:01:10.324 --> 01:01:18.190]  And then they just showed a video package only against him, trying to make him look like a liar, and then weird stuff about tyranny's now popular.
[01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:19.992]  Donald Trump likes Putin.
[01:01:21.613 --> 01:01:24.316]  And all he said is, I don't want to have war with Russia, and we can try to make better deals.
[01:01:24.336 --> 01:01:26.517]  Isn't that what you want a president to do?
[01:01:26.598 --> 01:01:27.298]  And then look at Drudge.
[01:01:27.338 --> 01:01:32.843]  It has the article, Prickly Don Rips Below Belt Jab, Size Matters.
[01:01:35.486 --> 01:01:42.029]  And then they say scientists, New York Daily News, that runs Pieces Every Day Against Trump, say fingers really do match size.
[01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:46.130]  I mean, this is what the debate has been turned into by the media.
[01:01:46.851 --> 01:01:49.552]  And then they act like Trump making a joke about it, he's the bad guy.
[01:01:51.452 --> 01:01:53.653]  When, by the way, Trump doesn't even have small hands.
[01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:55.374]  I have on average small hands, I can tell you that.
[01:01:56.544 --> 01:02:00.727]  Just in my experience, the stereotype's not true, but whatever!
[01:02:01.527 --> 01:02:07.171]  I mean, I actually have a giant head, about as big a hat size, I have to go to stores, I actually have almost special hat sizes for my head.
[01:02:07.571 --> 01:02:07.992]  What does that mean?
[01:02:08.012 --> 01:02:13.395]  I have a big brain, actually it does, but large CC size, a lot of dopamine, a lot of chemicals in there, a lot of energy.
[01:02:14.476 --> 01:02:18.499]  Also makes for a good weapon back in the day, but I'm just joking, folks.
[01:02:19.419 --> 01:02:20.280]  But look at this!
[01:02:22.119 --> 01:02:22.699]  Look at this.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:24.521]  Size matters.
[01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:25.582]  Okay, well then let's go there.
[01:02:25.922 --> 01:02:27.183]  Let's show Ted Cruz.
[01:02:27.963 --> 01:02:30.545]  I mean, we've all seen a booger fall out of somebody's nose on TV.
[01:02:30.565 --> 01:02:33.207]  We've all seen somebody having a piece of spittle on their lip.
[01:02:34.008 --> 01:02:40.413]  But with him, it's a big old juicy booger falls out of his nose, sits on his lip for a good 15 seconds.
[01:02:41.053 --> 01:02:44.437]  And then falls the bottom lip and then like he's a reptoid or something.
[01:02:44.878 --> 01:02:45.278]  Lizard.
[01:02:45.338 --> 01:02:48.522]  The tongue just lovingly like this is actually probably how he eats.
[01:02:48.562 --> 01:02:49.383]  He's from another planet.
[01:02:49.723 --> 01:02:52.706]  The food comes out of the sinus and he expert it.
[01:02:52.726 --> 01:02:54.549]  He kind of marinades for a minute and then falls.
[01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:56.731]  Let's play it again and then he just lovingly.
[01:02:57.212 --> 01:03:01.476]  Let's roll it for TV viewers on front screen so they can really get a blow up of this.
[01:03:02.037 --> 01:03:12.522]  And then just the snack, lovingly, sits on the lower lip and then the tongue just flicks almost instinctively like a bullfrog is asleep but a horsefly lands beside it.
[01:03:12.562 --> 01:03:17.685]  Just lovingly, oh, the lip just, mm, just, oh, there's a deliciousness there.
[01:03:17.705 --> 01:03:20.466]  And I have to say, he does it very elegantly.
[01:03:21.467 --> 01:03:23.128]  And I would feel it there and just brush it off.
[01:03:23.148 --> 01:03:25.129]  But he, he loved it.
[01:03:25.149 --> 01:03:29.471]  Somebody was actually probably pointing to him and says, hey, buddy, he sees it and he goes, oh, snack time.
[01:03:30.723 --> 01:03:31.343]  Delicious.
[01:03:31.804 --> 01:03:33.304]  So, delicious.
[01:03:33.344 --> 01:03:35.666]  So this is what we've come to in America.
[01:03:35.926 --> 01:03:39.608]  Can we slow down just the, just the part where he deliciouses?
[01:03:39.648 --> 01:03:42.169]  Where he, the prestige shot.
[01:03:42.329 --> 01:03:43.570]  The, what do they call those?
[01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:45.791]  The, the dinero shot.
[01:03:46.871 --> 01:03:48.052]  Uh, the shekel shot.
[01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:49.513]  The euro shot.
[01:03:50.253 --> 01:03:51.353]  The dollar shot.
[01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:52.394]  The yen shot.
[01:03:52.494 --> 01:03:53.014]  No, there's not.
[01:03:53.074 --> 01:03:54.055]  The money shot.
[01:03:54.515 --> 01:03:55.415]  There you go.
[01:03:56.276 --> 01:03:58.837]  Ah, delicious.
[01:03:58.957 --> 01:03:59.438]  Mmm.
[01:04:00.711 --> 01:04:06.936]  Wait a minute, you didn't... We ought to cut that together with the Caddyshack part where they're watching Spaulding, Judge Schmell's nephew.
[01:04:06.956 --> 01:04:08.958]  He goes, just look at Spaulding and I!
[01:04:09.138 --> 01:04:10.219]  We're regular pals!
[01:04:10.839 --> 01:04:13.982]  And then they're having bets on Will Spaulding eat the bugger?
[01:04:15.683 --> 01:04:16.504]  Of course he does.
[01:04:17.484 --> 01:04:18.705]  So, you could place bets.
[01:04:19.166 --> 01:04:23.609]  In Vegas, will Cruz eat the next bugger that falls out of his nose onto his lip?
[01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:27.512]  Hey, when the presidential reality show turns into
[01:04:29.571 --> 01:04:36.037]  Member size, male sexual member size, and booger eating.
[01:04:36.958 --> 01:04:40.061]  I don't ever cover sophomoric stuff, but hey, the gates are open now.
[01:04:42.043 --> 01:04:50.712]  In my experience, small hands, small hands actually don't affect things, but they do affect magical things.
[01:04:51.823 --> 01:04:53.765]  Because there is kind of a trick question to that.
[01:04:54.706 --> 01:04:59.011]  See, how does, it's like those balloons at the store that are this big, but then they get this big.
[01:04:59.471 --> 01:05:01.914]  So the question is, is everybody magical?
[01:05:02.014 --> 01:05:03.656]  Maybe you're magical when you have small hands.
[01:05:04.277 --> 01:05:05.338]  Now this is all fair to talk about.
[01:05:05.518 --> 01:05:07.240]  I'm sorry, Family Show, I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:05:07.901 --> 01:05:08.621]  It is true, though.
[01:05:08.661 --> 01:05:09.202]  It's amazing.
[01:05:09.382 --> 01:05:09.743]  We'll be back.
[01:05:11.042 --> 01:05:11.522]  Extra!
[01:05:11.703 --> 01:05:12.203]  Extra!
[01:05:12.323 --> 01:05:13.163]  Read all about it!

[01:05:19.727 --> 01:05:23.970]  This is the liberal response to a potential Donald Trump presidency.
[01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:33.136]  And they are claiming that left-leaning Americans all across the nation plan on packing it up and leaving the country should Donald Trump become president.
[01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:38.159]  The guide comes complete with a list of the cheapest and friendliest countries to run to.
[01:05:38.579 --> 01:05:44.504]  It also shows you how to get a work visa, and how to make new friends in your new environment.
[01:05:44.804 --> 01:05:50.409]  And there's even a list of celebrities who say they will leave the country if Trump wins the election.
[01:05:50.529 --> 01:05:57.315]  People like Rosie O'Donnell, Whoopi Goldberg, Jonathan Stewart, Samuel L. Jackson, and the Reverend Al Sharpton.
[01:05:57.435 --> 01:06:02.700]  Well, they say they are leaving the country if Donald Trump becomes President of the United States.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.103]  And we need to get behind this, and we need to support it.

[01:06:25.946 --> 01:06:26.607]  I feel better.
[01:06:26.667 --> 01:06:27.688]  I feel sexier.

[01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:17.340]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.962]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:37.797 --> 01:08:40.058]  All right, the next hour I'm going to be going to your phone calls.
[01:08:40.178 --> 01:08:42.340]  Brian, John, Mark, James, Ken.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:47.442]  Our guest is a talk show host in his own right, popular talk show host, so he'll be able to get into the election with us.
[01:08:47.462 --> 01:08:49.143]  We're going to your calls at the start of the next segment.
[01:08:50.324 --> 01:08:54.927]  We're going to get into feds arrest Bundy supporters in six states, and they're starting to go after innocent people.
[01:08:55.758 --> 01:09:00.160]  I know some of these people did threaten to shoot feds and stuff, and I said they were dumb and it shouldn't happen.
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:07.042]  The land rights issue is real, but now it's turned into a persecution and a branding of patriots as terrorists.
[01:09:07.922 --> 01:09:11.664]  We've got incredible radical Islamic news that I've got to get to with our guest.
[01:09:11.684 --> 01:09:12.584]  He's an expert on that.
[01:09:14.983 --> 01:09:22.610]  We have got to get to IBM and BMW teaming up and saying, oh no, in just a few years, you won't be able to drive your car.
[01:09:23.271 --> 01:09:24.672]  See, that's how driverless cars come in.
[01:09:24.712 --> 01:09:26.394]  They just make all the new cars driverless.
[01:09:27.175 --> 01:09:30.298]  And you can kind of act like you're driving, but it's going to take control all the time.
[01:09:31.679 --> 01:09:32.480]  That's a big deal.
[01:09:33.601 --> 01:09:36.244]  Big news on the UK trying to get out of the EU.
[01:09:38.086 --> 01:09:41.447]  We are also going to get, obviously, into the big election and your calls.
[01:09:42.367 --> 01:09:51.350]  But the reason I wanted last week, and now we've got him, to get Doug Hagman of HagmanandHagman.com, the Northeast Intelligence Network on, was about the Scalia situation.
[01:09:52.350 --> 01:10:02.373]  Now he told you there was going to be an investigation, now they admit that there is a private investigation going on, and the Washington Post tried to head it off admitting when he died in a secret society meeting.
[01:10:03.462 --> 01:10:07.424]  That was a spinoff of Bohemian Grove, not just a hunting society.
[01:10:07.905 --> 01:10:09.886]  And I'm not saying it's a bad society he was in.
[01:10:09.946 --> 01:10:10.946]  These are feeder groups.
[01:10:11.447 --> 01:10:12.547]  These are compartmentalized.
[01:10:14.509 --> 01:10:17.891]  He's got breaking news on the Supreme Court issue, and he has a lot of sources.
[01:10:17.951 --> 01:10:19.511]  Now, we have a lot of sources, too.
[01:10:20.612 --> 01:10:21.333]  Kind of like I had...
[01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:28.093]  Roger Stone, former head of Trump's campaign, is a good friend of 40-plus years on.
[01:10:28.113 --> 01:10:30.013]  And I said, yeah, I talked to Ventura the other day.
[01:10:30.033 --> 01:10:30.913]  He's coming on Friday.
[01:10:31.333 --> 01:10:34.654]  He says he really likes Donald Trump, has played golf with him and friends with him for 20-plus years.
[01:10:35.054 --> 01:10:37.415]  He's not going to run against him, but if it's Rubio, he is.
[01:10:38.815 --> 01:10:40.555]  And Stone goes, yeah, I talked to him yesterday.
[01:10:41.035 --> 01:10:42.656]  He wants me to be his campaign head if he runs.
[01:10:42.696 --> 01:10:43.456]  That's absolutely true.
[01:10:43.856 --> 01:10:45.596]  So see, I mean, I'm making phone calls.
[01:10:45.676 --> 01:10:46.817]  I'm getting inside baseball.
[01:10:47.097 --> 01:10:49.117]  But I also know how to verify if people are accurate.
[01:10:50.535 --> 01:11:09.122]  I would hear Doug Hagman probably eight, nine years ago, or longer, on Coast to Coast AM, and I said this last hour, I'm going to just say it now, and he would say, our sources in the federal government say they plan to flood Europe and the United States with radical Muslims to use the threat as a way to take our freedoms, and they're going to allow surreal law to be taught in schools, and I would just go, that is ridiculous.
[01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:11.803]  A lot of what he said I knew was true as I was confused.
[01:11:11.843 --> 01:11:18.146]  I liked hearing him on the radio, learned some stuff, knew a lot of it was true, but then he would say stuff that I was just like, you know, our elite aren't that crazy.
[01:11:18.826 --> 01:11:21.307]  Well, then Glenn Beck picked it up and a bunch of other people picked it up.
[01:11:21.327 --> 01:11:24.068]  And it's turned out it's true.
[01:11:24.768 --> 01:11:27.069]  So, that's why I like to get him on.
[01:11:27.109 --> 01:11:28.209]  We should get him on more often.
[01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:39.773]  I haven't been on in probably six months or so, but Doug Hagman joins us to talk about what he thinks about Scalia, or what's going on with the election, with his view on Trump, the Black Lives Matter.
[01:11:39.793 --> 01:11:45.315]  I mean, again, he was first started coming on five years ago on my show, once I figured out that, okay, he knows what he's talking about.
[01:11:48.891 --> 01:11:54.176]  He said they're going to fund black nationalist movements to kill police and try to start a civil war.
[01:11:54.416 --> 01:11:57.618]  That was before it was known Soros was even funding it, before it started.
[01:11:58.259 --> 01:12:00.000]  So I like to toot the horn of people.
[01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:02.663]  You can go back to those interviews who do know what they're talking about.
[01:12:02.863 --> 01:12:07.106]  So I want to know the rest of the inside baseball from Doug Hagman.
[01:12:08.047 --> 01:12:09.768]  And what's happening currently.
[01:12:09.808 --> 01:12:17.452]  So let's just do five minutes on Scalia, and on the new Supreme Court info he has, and let's move into all those other subjects that I just went into.
[01:12:17.532 --> 01:12:18.492]  Doug, great to have you back.
[01:12:18.552 --> 01:12:24.355]  I tell you, things are so exciting, so scary now, I can't even believe.
[01:12:24.375 --> 01:12:31.399]  Newt Gingrich is saying secret societies run everything on Fox News, and they're, I mean, everything we've talked about is just now coming out.
[01:12:32.358 --> 01:12:36.441]  I guess we really are run by crazy people who just want to destroy America and Christianity.
[01:12:36.481 --> 01:12:37.742]  I mean, it's what you said.
[01:12:37.762 --> 01:12:38.503]  It is the plan.
[01:12:39.004 --> 01:12:47.811]  What are your federal contacts telling you and state police contacts right now about what's happening with Scalia where that's all going?
[01:12:49.179 --> 01:12:50.241]  Alex, thanks for having me.
[01:12:50.581 --> 01:12:51.262]  A couple of things.
[01:12:51.322 --> 01:12:55.728]  With respect to Scalia, that investigation, his death, very mysterious indeed.
[01:12:56.729 --> 01:13:02.257]  John Poindexter, once people understand who he is, big Obama donor, all that, but investigation is 101.
[01:13:04.519 --> 01:13:17.902]  Him passing away or dying or being murdered, whatever, it's almost irrelevant, but at the ranch and the fact that the most basic of investigative policies were not followed, that in and of itself is really problematic.
[01:13:17.962 --> 01:13:24.603]  The fact that there was no official there present to declare him dead or to sign off on a death certificate.
[01:13:25.083 --> 01:13:32.445]  The fact that he was embalmed before, of course, the family physician has spoken with the person who signed off.
[01:13:32.985 --> 01:13:33.585]  Yes, we are.
[01:13:50.775 --> 01:13:55.398]  Scalia is out of the way, and now we've got a danger to our Constitution.
[01:13:56.019 --> 01:14:04.685]  I've got a ton of information about the actual scene itself and about the events before, during, and after.
[01:14:05.365 --> 01:14:15.713]  But Alex, what I want to tell you, and my sources are telling me this, and this is kind of the first time I'm going public with this in this platform.
[01:14:16.673 --> 01:14:17.214]  There will be
[01:14:18.345 --> 01:14:23.548]  Between now and election, another Supreme Court vacancy, okay?
[01:14:24.008 --> 01:14:44.478]  Now before anyone says, yells at me, Pelican Brief, it doesn't have to be a death, it could be a resignation, but the information I'm getting is I guarantee you there will be one more Supreme Court vacancy, and that is to solidify the Supreme Court on behalf of Obama, where he can nominate, select, and have the Senate confirm
[01:14:44.838 --> 01:14:54.667]  Two, not just one, but two nominees during his tenure to absolutely solidify the progressive Marxist agenda of this cabal that's in power.
[01:14:54.987 --> 01:14:59.191]  Now whether that happens according to the timeline, well, this is what's being told to me.
[01:14:59.351 --> 01:15:00.592]  I'm just relaying the information.
[01:15:00.692 --> 01:15:01.933]  Are they saying who it is?
[01:15:02.393 --> 01:15:02.834]  Ginsburg?
[01:15:04.218 --> 01:15:10.582]  That's, you know, not directly saying who it is, but by everything I've been able to really kind of get out of the people.
[01:15:10.602 --> 01:15:14.265]  Yeah, Ginsburg appears where she's going to retire for health reasons.
[01:15:14.325 --> 01:15:20.229]  Now, if that doesn't happen, then there may have to go to Plan B, and I'm not exactly sure what Plan B is.
[01:15:20.969 --> 01:15:21.670]  But watch for that.
[01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:29.055]  Okay, well, you told me five years ago they're worried about Obama wants to start a race war to bring in a civil emergency.
[01:15:29.075 --> 01:15:30.256]  We've seen him try that a bunch.
[01:15:32.064 --> 01:15:39.373]  You talk about the plan to flood us with Sharia law, and now I've got stacks of news today where it's happening in public schools everywhere they're teaching it.
[01:15:39.593 --> 01:15:41.195]  They're making kids put on hijabs.
[01:15:41.736 --> 01:15:42.997]  They're making them praise Allah.
[01:15:43.037 --> 01:15:44.519]  This is even non-Muslim teachers.
[01:15:44.799 --> 01:15:46.261]  This is actually Common Core.
[01:15:46.762 --> 01:15:49.205]  What is all of this about on that front?
[01:15:50.063 --> 01:15:56.766]  Well, it's, boy, everything works like a, all of these are cogs in a larger machine.
[01:15:57.547 --> 01:16:05.951]  The invasion, the alien invasion into this country is to rip the moral and spiritual and cultural fabric of our country, of course.
[01:16:05.971 --> 01:16:12.514]  That's what they showed at the Academy Awards, is they showed the Tower of Babel the whole time, in the background.
[01:16:13.134 --> 01:16:13.795]  What are they telling us?
[01:16:14.994 --> 01:16:18.835]  Well, they're in charge, and they're laughing at us.
[01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:20.356]  See, that's what people don't understand.
[01:16:20.376 --> 01:16:26.037]  They're showing this stuff, and people are looking at it and saying, well, you know, it's just art, it's entertainment, it's whatever.
[01:16:26.377 --> 01:16:34.700]  But the fact of the matter is, they're telling us what they're going to do before they do it, and they're laughing at us because no one's getting it, no one's understanding it, or at least very few are.
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:40.901]  You are, your audience is, but the majority of people are just, you know, hey, when we have really 32% of American people
[01:16:42.862 --> 01:16:47.284]  Never hearing, don't even know who Scalia was, for example, in a recent poll.
[01:16:47.965 --> 01:16:51.966]  We've got a problem in this country, obviously, and you've proven that many times.
[01:16:52.127 --> 01:16:56.429]  They don't know what planet they're on, so I'm asking a lot of questions here, and this is really important.
[01:16:56.829 --> 01:16:59.010]  What's the intel from all your great sources?
[01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:01.091]  What's the state of the republic right now?
[01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:03.172]  What are the big points we need to go over here today?
[01:17:03.903 --> 01:17:08.204]  Okay, great push right now to change the complexion of the judiciary.
[01:17:09.065 --> 01:17:23.369]  The fact is, if they could perhaps get Loretta Lynch in as a potential candidate for the Supreme Court, that'll throw the DOJ into some little bit of chaos there to take away from the Hillary Clinton indictment possibility.
[01:17:23.809 --> 01:17:31.631]  There's a war right now going on inside the FBI, according to my FBI source, saying that if she doesn't get indicted, there's a lot of good people, that they're going to lose a lot of good people.
[01:17:33.352 --> 01:17:39.376]  There's a push for additional racial riots this summer, but going for broke, that is.
[01:17:39.416 --> 01:17:40.917]  In other words, what we saw back in 2011.
[01:17:42.358 --> 01:17:43.859]  That was dress rehearsal.
[01:17:44.479 --> 01:17:45.100]  Absolutely.
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:46.481]  So we've got that.
[01:17:46.501 --> 01:17:51.204]  The economy, our economy is just, it's in a crap storm.
[01:17:51.364 --> 01:17:54.566]  I mean, however, what will help the economy?
[01:17:54.846 --> 01:17:55.647]  Well, we need a war.
[01:17:56.467 --> 01:18:05.790]  We've got a ready-made war right now in Syria, and I gotta tell you right now, Syria is, it's my belief that Syria will be, well, death race Damascus.
[01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:08.051]  The road to Damascus is the road to World War III.
[01:18:08.471 --> 01:18:16.993]  And despite Ukraine, despite the South Sea, Chinese Islands, Syria is where we need to keep our attention to, where NATO is being pitted against Russia by this globalist cabal.
[01:18:17.314 --> 01:18:21.595]  You pointed this out in your investigations years ago.
[01:18:21.815 --> 01:18:23.636]  So, it's all coming to pass right now.
[01:18:23.676 --> 01:18:24.756]  It's crunch time, so to speak.
[01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:28.660]  What else are your federal sources saying about the war going on in the government?
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:33.704]  Because they now admit that war you talked about many years ago is now out in the open, the purging of the military.
[01:18:34.445 --> 01:18:35.906]  I've never seen the military more awake.
[01:18:35.966 --> 01:18:38.308]  It's stunning how great they are, and they really get it.
[01:18:38.608 --> 01:18:48.256]  Does that concern the globalists, or are they just so arrogant they don't understand that basically everybody in special ops is awake, most of the general enlisted are awake, the non-commissioned officers are awake.
[01:18:48.656 --> 01:18:51.759]  I mean, that's got to be a major ace in the hole for freedom.
[01:18:52.691 --> 01:18:55.714]  Well, there's a couple of dynamics going on here.
[01:18:55.734 --> 01:19:03.503]  Of course, there's infighting among the globalists because you've got the old-time globalists, the new globalists who want to upstage the old-time globalists.
[01:19:04.244 --> 01:19:08.208]  Then you've got the other aspect of this, which is, interestingly enough, it's the
[01:19:08.989 --> 01:19:17.856]  The generation of the iPhones and iPads, the generation of the people who understand how to manipulate the electrons, so to speak.
[01:19:17.916 --> 01:19:22.980]  So, you've got this war going on using social media, which is really at the forefront.
[01:19:23.281 --> 01:19:29.325]  You're seeing censorship in Europe now coming to America with social media.
[01:19:29.726 --> 01:19:31.767]  Any talk against the globalists, or any talk against...
[01:19:33.729 --> 01:19:34.189]  Immigration.
[01:19:34.489 --> 01:19:42.654]  We're seeing unprecedented return of Nazi level censorship and our media says it's great telling you they're getting ready to push that here which is now begun.
[01:19:42.674 --> 01:19:45.516]  Conservatives and Libertarians are being purged everywhere.
[01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:46.803]  Exactly.
[01:19:47.103 --> 01:19:57.549]  So you've got, what we're looking at, and again, you've done so well to point this out, we've got war on multiple fronts, we've got war in the social media, we've got war within the various governmental departments.
[01:19:57.969 --> 01:20:10.355]  DHS, however, is the umbrella organization that's attempting to tie everything together, and kind of ahead of that, or on top of that, is this organization of a few... Stay there!
[01:20:10.415 --> 01:20:11.936]  The Secret Society of Guinness talks about
[01:20:12.056 --> 01:20:13.537]  Do you know how dangerous the world has become?
[01:20:13.837 --> 01:20:20.881]  In these days of terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or even a future collapse, you need to be medically prepared to keep your family safe.

[01:22:40.103 --> 01:22:42.845]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:22:43.145 --> 01:22:45.747]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:22:45.767 --> 01:22:46.208]  Croix River.
[01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:48.530]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:51.472]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:22:51.712 --> 01:22:52.232]  His excuse?
[01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:53.673]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:22:53.934 --> 01:22:55.215]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:22:55.535 --> 01:23:01.039]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[01:24:41.898 --> 01:24:45.100]  Your calls are coming up at the start of the next segment all across the board.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.700]  We'll get into the debate last night and more.
[01:24:48.121 --> 01:24:49.042]  I'm not scared.
[01:24:50.602 --> 01:24:54.124]  I've been studying our enemy for so long that I'm mainly sad.
[01:24:56.365 --> 01:25:02.208]  And yeah, I worry about my children, but I understand that past generations have gone through these times as well.
[01:25:03.817 --> 01:25:05.578]  And there have been a lot of different elites throughout history.
[01:25:05.598 --> 01:25:07.399]  A lot of them just wanted to conquer and run things.
[01:25:08.359 --> 01:25:12.822]  And a lot of times put in aqueducts and, you know, and actually built societies up.
[01:25:14.123 --> 01:25:17.784]  But still, the existing civilization wouldn't want to have their culture taken over.
[01:25:18.025 --> 01:25:19.125]  They had a right to fight back.
[01:25:19.986 --> 01:25:22.927]  The globalists are ending humanity as we know it in their own words.
[01:25:22.967 --> 01:25:24.128]  They call it the final revolution.
[01:25:25.472 --> 01:25:31.554]  And if you want to know who the quote liberals are, the leading edge of the societal takeover, they're the change agent arm.
[01:25:31.594 --> 01:25:33.875]  The Republicans are owned by the same people at the top.
[01:25:34.135 --> 01:25:35.496]  You're seeing that with Trump right now.
[01:25:37.897 --> 01:25:44.019]  They want to end the family, end the process, make us these atomized creatures like George Orwell talked about.
[01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:47.120]  Children being taken like you take eggs from a hen.
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:48.581]  Like North Korea.
[01:25:49.341 --> 01:25:51.862]  You go, but why would they want a horrible civilization like that?
[01:25:53.493 --> 01:26:21.206]  Because that's what evil people hunger after, and the fact that the so-called left, I have a stack of articles, I'm going to go through them here in a moment with our guest, lets imams into the US, Canada, England, you name it, that say, your daughters will wear headdresses and we're going to cut their genitals off, I mean these are the quotes, and we're going to kill your men, and we're going to blow up your police stations, and they let them in,
[01:26:22.639 --> 01:26:27.842]  And then they'll go arrest some militia guy who says, UN ever takes over, I'm gonna fight back, like Atari.
[01:26:28.022 --> 01:26:28.342]  Boom!
[01:26:28.782 --> 01:26:29.563]  Arrested, charged.
[01:26:30.423 --> 01:26:34.245]  And he was talking about the group Hagman was above Homeland Security.
[01:26:34.485 --> 01:26:38.888]  They set up Homeland Security to control all the other agencies, trying to make sure they follow these unconstitutional orders.
[01:26:40.208 --> 01:26:43.230]  And if the FBI won't go out and arrest all the patriots, they'll just create a new division.
[01:26:44.482 --> 01:26:45.763]  And that's what they're doing, folks.
[01:26:46.703 --> 01:26:48.904]  And you've got to understand, they really hate us.
[01:26:49.064 --> 01:26:50.025]  They call us Better Clingers.
[01:26:50.045 --> 01:26:52.326]  Doug, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:26:52.366 --> 01:26:53.527]  Hagman and Hagman.com.
[01:26:53.927 --> 01:26:54.987]  Folks want to find out more.
[01:26:55.568 --> 01:27:05.893]  I just want the listeners to realize this is for all the marbles, and we don't have any future if we really just don't understand it isn't brave to fight these people.
[01:27:06.733 --> 01:27:07.634]  It's survival.
[01:27:07.754 --> 01:27:08.634]  We don't have a choice.
[01:27:08.654 --> 01:27:09.475]  Do you get where I'm going?
[01:27:11.842 --> 01:27:15.164]  Absolutely, and you point out so many great points.
[01:27:15.184 --> 01:27:23.867]  You know, you did a video here a couple of days ago, I believe it was, about really the dark horse of the New World Order, that being technocracy.
[01:27:24.267 --> 01:27:34.532]  And I think if people really understood the bigger picture here, what's going on, we're being forced like cattle into this new old world order, so to speak.
[01:27:35.092 --> 01:27:46.497]  And what you're talking about, what you just brought up, the articles that you have right there, the focus, what you're focused on is really the key here where I think people need to understand that the picture is a lot bigger.
[01:27:46.517 --> 01:27:51.799]  How did you know first that they really plan to bring in radical jihadis and people and teach it in schools?
[01:27:52.259 --> 01:27:53.940]  What is the sick freak plan there?
[01:27:54.656 --> 01:28:04.879]  Well, and you know, look, I'm not the smartest, you know, not the brightest bulb in the bunch, so I've had some good sources tell me, okay, this is what they're going to do.
[01:28:05.259 --> 01:28:16.963]  Their ultimate objective is to criminalize the current forms of the three monotheistic religions here in the United States, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, if you can believe that.
[01:28:17.923 --> 01:28:25.507]  Distill all three religions, monotheistic religions, to create a state religion that's compatible, where all religions are compatible with one another.
[01:28:25.807 --> 01:28:26.927]  Ah, the UN plan.
[01:28:26.947 --> 01:28:31.850]  So get us all together, bring in radicals, have us fight and kill each other, and then take all our rights to create safety.
[01:28:32.526 --> 01:28:32.987]  That's right.
[01:28:33.768 --> 01:28:41.178]  And yes, in order to do that, they've got to rip down the existing infrastructure in order to create a new one, just like the Phoenix, and as you've gone through so many times.
[01:28:41.198 --> 01:28:42.960]  Yeah, but you say you're not the smartest bulb.
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:46.285]  I mean, you just crystallized that better than I ever could, and that is the plan.
[01:28:46.505 --> 01:28:48.427]  Now, is that what your federal sources told you?
[01:28:48.447 --> 01:28:49.889]  Because you were saying this eight, nine years ago.
[01:28:50.526 --> 01:28:51.547]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:28:52.067 --> 01:28:52.827]  That's what they were saying.
[01:28:52.907 --> 01:28:55.609]  I was having a hard time really understanding what the big plan was.
[01:28:55.909 --> 01:29:01.571]  I was so focused on these small skirmishes or these individual disparate events that I wasn't seeing the big picture.
[01:29:02.072 --> 01:29:04.313]  And what you've done is to crystallize the big picture in others.
[01:29:05.453 --> 01:29:10.316]  Once you see the big picture and understand how one event works in tandem with another... There's no going back.
[01:29:10.996 --> 01:29:11.416]  That's it.
[01:29:11.896 --> 01:29:27.720]  And so, for example, the war in Syria is connected to the illegal immigration of aliens here in the United States, which is connected to the criminalization of free speech, which is connected to the Second Amendment, and people who stand in the way, like Scalia, of the First and Second Amendment.
[01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:29.020]  I mean, everything is connected.
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:35.142]  And once you see that, the wheels in motion, those little cogs, the moving parts, and you can see...
[01:29:35.882 --> 01:29:36.262]  We're good to go.
[01:29:50.991 --> 01:29:54.715]  Like you said, once you see the big picture, folks, it's just killing.
[01:29:55.195 --> 01:29:57.057]  Again, I'm getting chills all over me right now.
[01:29:57.097 --> 01:29:58.178]  We are in danger.
[01:29:58.659 --> 01:29:59.620]  We are in danger.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.221]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.702 --> 01:30:03.303]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:04.224 --> 01:30:06.927]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:11.098 --> 01:30:11.979]  He's an outsider.
[01:30:12.019 --> 01:30:12.640]  He's not them.
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:13.722]  He's not part of the club.
[01:30:14.182 --> 01:30:15.224]  He's uncontrollable.
[01:30:16.025 --> 01:30:18.227]  He hasn't lived through the initiation rites.
[01:30:18.268 --> 01:30:19.950]  He didn't belong to the secret society.
[01:30:20.050 --> 01:30:25.978]  That was former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich explaining why the Republican establishment is so scared of Donald Trump.
[01:30:26.278 --> 01:30:28.421]  Gingrich would know about secret societies.
[01:30:28.681 --> 01:30:41.513]  Given his affiliation with Bohemian Grove, although he could also be speaking of the Skull and Bones Club, which is notorious for its initiation rituals, so far Trump has played the role of outsider and people are loving him for it.
[01:30:41.673 --> 01:30:46.398]  But he has held private briefings with some secret society types, like Richard Haass.
[01:30:46.538 --> 01:30:49.140]  Haass is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:30:49.321 --> 01:30:53.825]  He's also a member of the influential Trilateral Commission and a Bilderberg attendee.
[01:30:54.145 --> 01:31:01.408]  Earlier this week, a number of prominent neocons released an open letter stating their opposition to the candidacy of Donald Trump.
[01:31:01.709 --> 01:31:03.289]  Haas did not sign the letter.
[01:31:03.469 --> 01:31:06.311]  Could Richard Haas be one of Trump's potential cabinet picks?
[01:31:06.571 --> 01:31:08.852]  Read more now at InfoWars.com.
[01:31:12.308 --> 01:31:15.710]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:31:16.071 --> 01:31:23.195]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:31:23.816 --> 01:31:32.181]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:31:32.442 --> 01:31:36.524]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:31:36.844 --> 01:31:42.108]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:31:42.428 --> 01:31:46.290]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:31:46.670 --> 01:31:49.771]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:31:50.071 --> 01:32:01.156]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[01:32:04.117 --> 01:32:10.060]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:14.003]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:14.303 --> 01:32:22.309]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:22.530 --> 01:32:27.574]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:32:47.447 --> 01:32:52.068]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[01:32:52.268 --> 01:32:59.190]  This new 4-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.

[01:33:11.928 --> 01:33:18.373]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:33:18.434 --> 01:33:20.555]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:22.817 --> 01:33:28.461]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:33.923 --> 01:33:46.397]  Ladies and gentlemen, please never forget, we are listener and viewer supported, not big corporate sponsors, not with bank or bailout money like MSNBC or NPR that also beg for money weekly and sell you coffee cups for $100.
[01:33:46.437 --> 01:33:49.561]  And Rockefeller funded openly.
[01:33:50.509 --> 01:34:12.924]  We're funded by selling amazing, high-quality, pro-gun, pro-liberty, wide spectrum of t-shirts, other apparel, sweatshirts, ball caps, the best deals on optics that are selected by a group of special ops folks, retired, that we buy the top optics and stuff like G-Shock watches from national dealers.
[01:34:12.964 --> 01:34:18.528]  We're now a national dealer, you name it, at very competitive prices at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.861]  We've got colloidal silver toothbrushes.
[01:34:23.141 --> 01:34:24.202]  We've been selling them for two years.
[01:34:24.262 --> 01:34:25.262]  I've never even plugged.
[01:34:25.282 --> 01:34:34.466]  They're one of our best sellers now that has it impregnated inside the bristles to keep the toothbrush from growing bacteria when you're not using it and also put that into your gums.
[01:34:34.546 --> 01:34:37.827]  It's just amazing stuff like that at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:34:38.427 --> 01:34:39.428]  We have AnthroPlex.
[01:34:39.988 --> 01:34:44.670]  It is basically the organic dry herb version of Super Mel Vitality.
[01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:47.231]  And it's super high quality.
[01:34:47.271 --> 01:34:47.991]  It goes together.
[01:34:48.011 --> 01:34:50.412]  It has a few ingredients that SuperMail doesn't have.
[01:34:50.432 --> 01:34:51.893]  SuperMail is excellent as well.
[01:34:52.373 --> 01:34:53.654]  You know, it's the Cadillac version.
[01:34:53.674 --> 01:34:55.874]  This is like the LTD version, but they're both excellent.
[01:34:56.135 --> 01:34:57.315]  They blow away leading competitors.
[01:34:57.335 --> 01:35:00.977]  Go read the rave reviews at m4warslife.com.
[01:35:01.017 --> 01:35:02.677]  That is now back in stock.
[01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:04.298]  Silver Bullet.
[01:35:04.318 --> 01:35:08.420]  This sale will have to end this weekend because we're going to sell out of it probably at current sales rates.
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:11.281]  50% off on high quality coil solar right now.
[01:35:12.895 --> 01:35:18.056]  With the antibiotics and stuff not working anymore in a lot of cases, it's not a silver bullet, but it's darn close to it.
[01:35:18.296 --> 01:35:23.217]  Check it out for yourself, find out the benefits of 30 parts per million, super high quality colloidal silver.
[01:35:23.497 --> 01:35:31.259]  This same bottle, made by the same manufacturer, we just private label it, sells for upwards of $30, usually about $25 at major stores.
[01:35:31.299 --> 01:35:33.159]  We have it $9.95.
[01:35:33.299 --> 01:35:35.300]  No one sells it at that price.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.260]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:41.761]  A lot of our products are proprietary, original, developed for us by top
[01:35:42.501 --> 01:35:49.167]  Uh, chemists and nutritionists and doctors and researchers, but a lot of them are just from the biggest high-quality organic manufacturers in the country.
[01:35:49.187 --> 01:35:51.790]  About half our items are private-labeled for us.
[01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:58.035]  Like, Child-Ease is the number one selling for 30-something years child aid just to calm children down.
[01:35:58.055 --> 01:36:01.539]  It doesn't make them sleep, just calms them down with a bunch of key herbs, like a syrup.
[01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:03.461]  And it tastes pretty good, too.
[01:36:03.481 --> 01:36:04.362]  Kind of tastes like licorice.
[01:36:05.402 --> 01:36:06.283]  And it's amazing.
[01:36:06.583 --> 01:36:08.525]  Just check out, and it's $25.
[01:36:09.105 --> 01:36:10.527]  The same bottle with a different label is $25.
[01:36:10.987 --> 01:36:11.387]  Again, ours is $19.95.
[01:36:15.964 --> 01:36:19.667]  So you're supporting us, you're getting high quality products that you really need.
[01:36:19.687 --> 01:36:22.069]  It is a win-win on so many fronts.
[01:36:22.089 --> 01:36:26.273]  The liver shield is also back in stock for the gallbladder cleanse.
[01:36:26.633 --> 01:36:33.980]  Check out the informational videos at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:42.547]  Now going back to Doug Hagman, who's a law enforcement specialist, private detective, holds a whole bunch of certificates and areas you
[01:36:43.795 --> 01:36:45.096]  And most of us don't even know about.
[01:36:45.116 --> 01:36:46.236]  The point is he's an expert.
[01:36:46.756 --> 01:36:49.617]  He consults with the FBI, state police in multiple states.
[01:36:50.317 --> 01:36:52.338]  He's a talk show host in his own right, if you just tuned in.
[01:36:52.418 --> 01:36:54.879]  I'd hear him on Coast to Coast AM eight, nine years ago.
[01:36:55.399 --> 01:37:03.422]  I think this guy knows what he's talking about on a lot of stuff, but he's saying they're going to bring in all these radical Muslims into Europe and the US and flood us and bring in Sharia law.
[01:37:03.482 --> 01:37:05.583]  And he's one of the first I ever heard saying this.
[01:37:05.603 --> 01:37:06.904]  He had it from sources in the government.
[01:37:07.864 --> 01:37:09.124]  And then that stuff started coming true.
[01:37:09.805 --> 01:37:13.126]  But before that came true, he was saying they're going to
[01:37:14.653 --> 01:37:18.595]  For my sources, create race war in the country and stir everything up when Obama gets in.
[01:37:18.615 --> 01:37:19.655]  He's not going to be a unifier.
[01:37:19.975 --> 01:37:23.276]  And they're going to try to bring in federal control off the backs of that.
[01:37:23.296 --> 01:37:24.937]  And they're going to have a big anti-police movement.
[01:37:25.337 --> 01:37:27.298]  And that's going to build towards the end of his second term.
[01:37:27.318 --> 01:37:28.258]  This is like eight years ago.
[01:37:30.019 --> 01:37:30.759]  And now it's happening.
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:35.261]  So that's why I listen to him because his sources really know what's going on.
[01:37:35.281 --> 01:37:37.002]  I want to get to the election and phone calls here.
[01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:38.318]  With you.
[01:37:39.599 --> 01:37:42.161]  But I've been so busy, I haven't really been following what you've said about Trump.
[01:37:42.621 --> 01:37:49.326]  That attempted assassination politically last night, the train wreck, the informational attack videos.
[01:37:49.847 --> 01:37:52.629]  I mean, they threw everything at him, including the kitchen sink.
[01:37:53.029 --> 01:37:54.810]  They had the lights all turned up in his face.
[01:37:56.331 --> 01:37:58.053]  They were all piled on against him.
[01:37:59.394 --> 01:38:02.236]  Why is the power structure so scared of Donald Trump?
[01:38:02.336 --> 01:38:03.256]  Or do you disagree with that?
[01:38:03.497 --> 01:38:05.138]  What do you think's happening, Mr. Hagman?
[01:38:06.109 --> 01:38:08.671]  No, and Alex, I think you're exactly right.
[01:38:08.731 --> 01:38:12.614]  I watched your first hour, and I totally agree with your assessment of things.
[01:38:13.694 --> 01:38:20.919]  Look, Trump is saying everything that Americans want to hear, or at least the most rational, sensible Americans.
[01:38:22.741 --> 01:38:25.603]  Trump is actually out there saying what we want to hear.
[01:38:25.623 --> 01:38:28.225]  Now that's good news and bad news, obviously.
[01:38:28.265 --> 01:38:31.407]  It's bad news as far as the state of the country is concerned.
[01:38:31.867 --> 01:38:35.888]  Good news because we have ostensibly a guy in there that wants to fix things.
[01:38:35.928 --> 01:38:40.010]  And of course the establishment Republicans want to take him out.
[01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:41.730]  They don't want to deal with him.
[01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:48.532]  And they're going to pull every dirty trick in the book to get him off of the ballot or make sure he doesn't get on the ballot.
[01:38:48.552 --> 01:38:49.893]  And that's what's taking place right now.
[01:38:50.273 --> 01:38:53.374]  I have a guy within the political system who's telling me that
[01:38:54.014 --> 01:39:00.178]  Through some delegate, superdelegate trickery, they can knock them off of a couple of key states.
[01:39:01.359 --> 01:39:05.602]  Every delegate takes all, or winner takes all states.
[01:39:06.142 --> 01:39:08.804]  I'm not exactly sure how that works, but they're going to try to pull that.
[01:39:08.824 --> 01:39:12.066]  They're going to try to pull other people into the race.
[01:39:12.106 --> 01:39:13.627]  Of course, they've got a package.
[01:39:14.767 --> 01:39:21.969]  Already ready to be deployed against Donald Trump in terms of his past, his bankruptcies, his mob connections.
[01:39:21.989 --> 01:39:25.990]  So this has yet to come out, at least in the form that they intend.
[01:39:26.010 --> 01:39:28.690]  Are your sources saying anything about mob connections being real?
[01:39:28.810 --> 01:39:30.071]  I mean, we obviously know there's women.
[01:39:30.251 --> 01:39:31.391]  He doesn't lie about that.
[01:39:32.431 --> 01:39:34.952]  I mean, are your sources saying any of this could be damaging?
[01:39:35.492 --> 01:39:36.452]  Or is it all just fluff?
[01:39:37.177 --> 01:39:43.741]  Well, my source, in particular, the one I've been listening to about Donald Trump is the perception is reality.
[01:39:44.182 --> 01:39:45.823]  It doesn't matter real, not real.
[01:39:45.863 --> 01:39:49.005]  It doesn't matter as long as we can make it appear that it's real.
[01:39:49.405 --> 01:39:55.089]  As far as the mob connections are concerned, according to, again, to my source, no, not really.
[01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:58.992]  You're going to run into different business people who have connections to connect to other people.
[01:39:59.032 --> 01:40:03.615]  And, you know, you're always a degree or two away from somebody that
[01:40:04.315 --> 01:40:10.056]  You're not doing business in New Jersey and New York without, you're not building buildings without running into some of the wise guys.
[01:40:10.556 --> 01:40:11.557]  That's correct.
[01:40:11.597 --> 01:40:25.219]  So, the big thing to watch here is the Karl Rovian apparatus at work here, I believe, and that is, and this is what I think, Alex, people really don't understand is, we think that there's a two-party system.
[01:40:25.239 --> 01:40:26.880]  You're very good at breaking this down.
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:28.820]  It's a one-party system and it's the globalists.
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:30.141]  We're not a part of that party.
[01:40:30.521 --> 01:40:31.241]  It's their party.
[01:40:31.301 --> 01:40:31.981]  We're not invited.
[01:40:32.501 --> 01:40:38.824]  But the fact of the matter is they'd rather take out Trump and have Hillary in than they would have Trump in and reunite.
[01:40:38.864 --> 01:40:41.806]  And the Republican leadership has said that, Mitch McConnell and others.
[01:40:42.226 --> 01:40:44.747]  What arrogant creatures to defy the will of the people.
[01:40:45.107 --> 01:40:46.608]  It shows how disconnected they are.
[01:40:47.932 --> 01:41:04.261]  Exactly, and Trump, whether he's, you know, I like to think his heart is true and he's serious, and whether he can do this is another thing or not, but Trump gets in there, of course, and there's a lot of people who are going to lose their jobs and potentially face indictment if that's even possible.
[01:41:05.341 --> 01:41:09.603]  So that's why they're fighting so hard, is they're worried that they could all be going to jail, like Hillary!
[01:41:10.224 --> 01:41:12.305]  And he says if he gets in, he's going to try to get her indicted.
[01:41:13.072 --> 01:41:29.629]  Right, and we have to watch that Hillary situation again because the immunity granted to Brian Pagliano does suggest, at least in my experience, that either a grand jury has been convened or they are going to be convening a grand jury.
[01:41:30.069 --> 01:41:34.831]  Whether or not that gets out of the grand jury venue, well, that remains to be seen.
[01:41:34.851 --> 01:41:39.493]  But the fact is they could cause a lot of, well, there's some leverage there, I guess is what I'm saying.
[01:41:39.533 --> 01:41:43.194]  So we need to really take a look at that in terms of Hillary.
[01:41:43.234 --> 01:41:50.717]  But for some reason, well, I think for the obvious reasons, they want Hillary and they want her in the position of power.
[01:41:50.757 --> 01:41:57.520]  And I'm talking about the Republicans, the gang of eight, part of the gang of eight, who are ceding their power to the executive branch.
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:05.805]  Which is just absolutely... Oh yeah, we saw Mitch McConnell try to sneak a defense bill through that literally makes the president a dictator in the Senate's own words.
[01:42:06.565 --> 01:42:06.986]  That's right.
[01:42:07.106 --> 01:42:11.909]  And they're not doing this, as some might say, for the next future Republican or conservative president.
[01:42:11.929 --> 01:42:14.931]  They're doing this right now for their current power grab.
[01:42:15.191 --> 01:42:19.374]  Let me ask you this, because what you've said about the feds, the military, again, that all came out from your sources.
[01:42:19.394 --> 01:42:20.194]  I know you have a lot of them.
[01:42:20.374 --> 01:42:24.137]  I'm sure they're on the East Coast and have been working with law enforcement for 40 years.
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:28.041]  The military is just so awake.
[01:42:28.081 --> 01:42:29.941]  I talk about this constantly because it's such good news.
[01:42:30.721 --> 01:42:40.464]  I mean, whether it's Green Berets or current Delta Force or Navy SEALs or even officers up to full bird colonel level, they go, look, we all know about the takeover.
[01:42:40.504 --> 01:42:41.565]  We know about all the plans.
[01:42:41.945 --> 01:42:43.185]  We understand you're dead right.
[01:42:43.205 --> 01:42:44.105]  We've been occupied.
[01:42:44.666 --> 01:42:45.786]  They've done the same thing to Europe.
[01:42:46.684 --> 01:42:48.905]  You know, we're just waiting until they give an order that goes too far.
[01:42:49.025 --> 01:42:50.186]  And I mean, this is universal.
[01:42:50.226 --> 01:42:53.168]  This isn't them telling me two-sided stuff to, you know, setting me up.
[01:42:53.208 --> 01:42:53.848]  This is for real.
[01:42:54.649 --> 01:42:55.409]  People are freaked out.
[01:42:56.130 --> 01:43:00.493]  But separately, though, I see feds, though, that seem to really want to go after the patriots.
[01:43:00.513 --> 01:43:01.113]  They're leftists.
[01:43:01.153 --> 01:43:01.593]  They hate us.
[01:43:02.154 --> 01:43:06.937]  What percentage of the feds, just dead reckoning, really are anti-American and hate us, or do
[01:43:07.897 --> 01:43:28.712]  Are there a lot of feds, because I've seen some of this myself, who really are genuinely upset, genuinely concerned, as I'm not going to be on the street, some of them actually senior, I'll look them up later, and there they are on TV and stuff, a lot of them I don't have time to contact, they contact me, you know, high level, people in the Treasury Department, you name it, FBI, I just can't mess with it, I just stay out of it all.
[01:43:30.874 --> 01:43:35.498]  But at the same time, they claim that they know what's going on, too, and aren't going along with it.
[01:43:36.299 --> 01:43:39.501]  How big is that internal fight, and how many are black hats versus white hats?
[01:43:40.522 --> 01:43:41.163]  Great question.
[01:43:41.343 --> 01:43:53.153]  Eight years ago, the numbers would have been reversed to what I'm about to tell you, but right now, 30% are the old school, stick-by-the-Constitution look, let's stand by the American people, 70% are not.
[01:43:53.573 --> 01:43:55.815]  So Obama has packed his people in there?
[01:43:56.348 --> 01:43:57.809]  Yeah, very much so.
[01:43:57.889 --> 01:44:00.530]  And that's so unfortunate what's happening.
[01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:02.351]  And we're losing a lot of great people.
[01:44:02.371 --> 01:44:11.395]  A lot of the people that I went to school with, for example, and are in law enforcement who are just retiring and saying, we can't fight this leviathan.
[01:44:11.875 --> 01:44:28.046]  But there's this cancer that's growing within each individual federal organization and what they're doing very quickly here is they're militarizing the local municipal police forces as well and saturating the ranks of the local police departments with these
[01:44:28.706 --> 01:44:39.273]  Military-style people and equipment, obviously, that you report on, but this is actually being done with more, well, in earnest now.
[01:44:39.653 --> 01:44:48.599]  And there's a push on now to make sure as much as this is done before the end of Obama's supposed tenure is up.
[01:44:49.963 --> 01:44:53.024]  Well, all I know is it is historical what's happening.
[01:44:53.044 --> 01:44:54.264]  It is super creepy.
[01:44:55.264 --> 01:45:02.686]  And I've seen it backfire with local police all over the country, though, when they call them in and actually badmouth towards Washington veterans.
[01:45:03.026 --> 01:45:04.446]  They say veterans are your new enemy.
[01:45:04.466 --> 01:45:06.807]  You're going to have a war with them.
[01:45:06.867 --> 01:45:14.349]  That seems to really kind of wake people up, except, as you said, they're doing special acceleration of Politico police and bureaucrats.
[01:45:15.171 --> 01:45:26.823]  Where I've been out to national parks and stuff and see armed park rangers now that literally act like social justice warriors and literally come and get in everyone's face and treat everyone like we're in boot camp or something.
[01:45:27.543 --> 01:45:31.427]  And they've been told it's come out in the training manuals, break their will, show them you're the boss.
[01:45:32.428 --> 01:45:34.169]  Don't these people read history books?
[01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:36.171]  Don't they know they're being set up to be totalitarians?
[01:45:36.231 --> 01:45:38.892]  I mean, don't they understand they're being set up to be bad guys?
[01:45:39.433 --> 01:45:41.414]  No, and there it is right there.
[01:45:42.334 --> 01:45:44.656]  We are being subjected to revisionist history.
[01:45:44.716 --> 01:45:54.382]  It's interesting because if you pick up a government textbook or a textbook about government from the, we'll say the 29, 30, 31, in that 19, you know, early 20th century textbook, compare it to today.
[01:45:59.085 --> 01:46:03.386]  There's a lot that has been revised and removed, especially about constitutional issues.
[01:46:03.847 --> 01:46:24.753]  So we are actually seeing the second and third generation of men and women in the police force who don't really understand, unless they've taken advanced courses specific to the Constitution by non-Ivy League, non-leftist universities, they don't understand.
[01:46:25.513 --> 01:46:26.214]  The Constitution.
[01:46:45.373 --> 01:46:45.853]  No, you're right.
[01:46:46.354 --> 01:46:47.234]  You're exactly right.
[01:46:47.814 --> 01:46:59.280]  And I think a percentage of those, a percentage of the 70% may in fact, when it goes real, for example, may understand, look, I've got to protect my family and then break away.
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:04.623]  But there's a hard line in there of people that I cannot believe.
[01:47:04.663 --> 01:47:09.085]  And again, my contact within one of the federal agencies said,
[01:47:10.054 --> 01:47:16.739]  You just can't believe the mentality of these new recruits and these people that have been, that are in there, embedded within the agencies.
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:17.740]  They don't care.
[01:47:18.401 --> 01:47:24.626]  If they were told to go arrest their grandmother or mother, they would do that in a heartbeat, as opposed to thinking it through.
[01:47:24.726 --> 01:47:29.309]  They understand in free society, in the military and everything, it's all about not following legal orders.
[01:47:29.349 --> 01:47:29.650]  I loved it.
[01:47:31.731 --> 01:47:38.397]  I loved watching Hayden go, we wouldn't follow Trump's orders because we don't do unconstitutional things, when they're the ones that got him to all do stuff that was wrong.
[01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.629]  Exactly.
[01:47:40.650 --> 01:47:48.457]  And how do you even... There's nothing that can be said coherently about the policies that we're seeing being employed.
[01:47:49.157 --> 01:47:52.120]  And again, I go back to... Open the border, bring in the illegals, persecute the patriots.
[01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:54.622]  We're going to get to more of that with our guest, Doug Hagman.
[01:47:54.642 --> 01:47:57.365]  I want to go to your calls, John, Brian, Ken, Mark, James.
[01:47:57.385 --> 01:48:02.269]  Sorry for making you hold so long, but I want you to talk about what you saw in the debate last night and our guests can comment on that.
[01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:04.811]  Brian in Georgia, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:48:04.851 --> 01:48:05.272]  What do you think?
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:14.585]  Hey Alex, my wife and I are also delegates for the Georgia Republican Party, and more about that in a minute.
[01:48:14.605 --> 01:48:19.069]  But I wanted to talk to you about, did you hear Lou Dobbs yesterday?
[01:48:19.089 --> 01:48:28.935]  I mean, he went on a rant about the Republican insiders that was just, you know, the only way I can describe it is it was miraculous.
[01:48:29.836 --> 01:48:30.316]  I didn't see it.
[01:48:30.336 --> 01:48:31.037]  What was the name of it?
[01:48:31.077 --> 01:48:31.597]  We'll pull it up.
[01:48:31.657 --> 01:48:34.639]  Lou Dobbs talks about Republican insiders.
[01:48:34.679 --> 01:48:35.280]  Maybe go to YouTube.
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:37.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:39.982]  Lou Dobbs was on his show yesterday.
[01:48:40.462 --> 01:48:41.082]  Fox Business.
[01:48:41.142 --> 01:48:41.942]  Okay, we'll look it up.
[01:48:44.304 --> 01:48:46.445]  I mean, it was just incredible.
[01:48:46.685 --> 01:48:47.685]  Well, Lou Dobbs has been on.
[01:48:47.745 --> 01:48:48.366]  He's a listener.
[01:48:48.386 --> 01:48:50.847]  Fox won't let him come on, but he's almost a daily listener.
[01:48:50.887 --> 01:48:51.567]  He is a patriot.
[01:48:53.728 --> 01:49:05.394]  But as far as being a delegate is concerned, what we really need to have to do is to make sure, starting at the county level and in the state level,
[01:49:06.036 --> 01:49:10.758]  Is to make sure that no elected official gets to go to the National Convention.
[01:49:11.318 --> 01:49:18.340]  If we make sure that no elected official gets to go to the National Convention... That's right, don't let them come in and boss you around and take over the delegate and superdelegate places.
[01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:20.521]  You go, you be delegates, learn how it works.
[01:49:20.881 --> 01:49:21.961]  It varies from area to area.
[01:49:22.001 --> 01:49:23.342]  What did you think about the debate last night?
[01:49:25.002 --> 01:49:26.142]  I thought it was incredible.
[01:49:27.263 --> 01:49:32.445]  You know, I think no matter what they try to throw at Trump, he's going to come out of it great.
[01:49:32.645 --> 01:49:33.445]  I also think that
[01:49:34.389 --> 01:49:38.991]  Mitt Romney shot himself in the foot and they're going to try to get Paul Ryan to go in.
[01:49:39.272 --> 01:49:41.253]  Yep, I think Paul Ryan's in the wings as well.
[01:49:41.293 --> 01:49:41.753]  Thank you.
[01:49:42.473 --> 01:49:43.854]  Let's go ahead and talk to John of Wyoming.
[01:49:43.874 --> 01:49:45.095]  John, what did you think about last night?
[01:49:46.115 --> 01:49:46.635]  Hi Alex.
[01:49:47.376 --> 01:49:48.716]  I saw the debate myself.
[01:49:48.837 --> 01:49:59.282]  Now the two things that concern me, and oh by the way, after this I'm going to give you some good news on how Trump can destroy Hillary's campaign as well as the Bush crime family.
[01:49:59.870 --> 01:50:07.919]  Now, the one thing that bothered me on the debate is that Trump mentioned Richard Haass, who is, of course, the president of the CFR.
[01:50:07.959 --> 01:50:08.599]  I talked about that.
[01:50:08.619 --> 01:50:09.320]  He met with him.
[01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:11.162]  There's an article on Infowars.com, yes.
[01:50:11.703 --> 01:50:11.943]  Right.
[01:50:12.543 --> 01:50:17.529]  And then, of course, Newt Gingrich is a decades-long member of the CFR.
[01:50:17.969 --> 01:50:22.494]  Now, for the good news, here's how he can destroy Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[01:50:23.197 --> 01:50:34.730]  First of all, when Bill Clinton in 1994 was president, he allowed Westinghouse to sell two nuclear reactors to North Korea, from which... That they used to build nukes.
[01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:35.211]  That's right.
[01:50:35.251 --> 01:50:35.691]  He's got her.
[01:50:35.911 --> 01:50:37.713]  Hillary gave the nukes to Kim Jong-un.
[01:50:37.733 --> 01:50:38.735]  He'll destroy her.
[01:50:39.015 --> 01:50:39.475]  It's true.
[01:50:39.576 --> 01:50:40.837]  I forgot about those.
[01:50:41.197 --> 01:50:42.158]  I covered it at the time.
[01:50:42.879 --> 01:50:51.507]  And they helped transfer the MIRV technology and the re-entry technology, but also the booster technology of Laura Allen Hughes of the Chi-Coms.
[01:50:51.567 --> 01:50:52.087]  Great point.
[01:50:52.527 --> 01:50:54.049]  Again, always selling us out.
[01:50:54.069 --> 01:50:56.731]  I want to get Doug Hagman's take on that straight ahead.
[01:50:56.791 --> 01:50:57.792]  Thank you so much, caller.
[01:50:57.812 --> 01:50:58.673]  You made a great point, John.
[01:50:59.033 --> 01:51:03.797]  We're going to also go to Ken, Brian, Mark, James, and others, as I said, straight ahead, back in three minutes.
[01:51:03.857 --> 01:51:06.519]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:08.641]  And we got that Newt Gingrich clip coming up, too.
[01:51:08.661 --> 01:51:09.702]  We haven't played in this hour.
[01:51:09.722 --> 01:51:10.243]  It's powerful.
[01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:12.540]  Planning to buy food storage?
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:13.520]  Wait a minute!
[01:51:13.781 --> 01:51:16.921]  Many companies try to confuse you with the number of servings they sell.
[01:51:17.241 --> 01:51:20.582]  It's not about the number of servings, it's about the number of calories.
[01:51:20.962 --> 01:51:23.443]  In emergencies, calories mean survival.
[01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:27.303]  Go to ReadySupplyFoods.com for a comparison of leading companies.
[01:51:27.783 --> 01:51:31.364]  ReadySupply Foods sells the most calories per dollar of any company.
[01:51:31.784 --> 01:51:35.645]  Our 23 entrees and breakfasts are delicious and full of nutritious calories.
[01:51:35.665 --> 01:51:37.825]  The new leader in value and quality.

[01:51:42.219 --> 01:51:44.420]  Think body armor is just for commandos?
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:45.361]  Think again.
[01:51:45.741 --> 01:51:48.963]  In a collapse situation, you need to protect your entire family.
[01:51:49.323 --> 01:51:55.046]  Infidel Body Armor has created lightweight armor that repels AR-15 and AK-47 rounds.
[01:51:55.326 --> 01:51:58.488]  And priced at around $500, it won't break the bank.
[01:51:58.628 --> 01:52:00.469]  The whole kit weighs just 10 pounds.
[01:52:00.649 --> 01:52:02.831]  Light enough for your 7-year-old or 70-year-old.
[01:52:03.011 --> 01:52:06.032]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com and get yours today.
[01:52:06.233 --> 01:52:08.174]  That's infidelbodyarmor.com.
[01:52:08.854 --> 01:52:09.875]  Just won't quit.
[01:52:10.735 --> 01:52:17.663]  Something just happened that has explained why survival food is literally flying off the shelves and is sold out in many areas of the country.
[01:52:18.103 --> 01:52:21.867]  It caught me totally by surprise, and it involves FEMA.
[01:52:22.308 --> 01:52:27.894]  Now, revealing FEMA's plaque could land me in hot water, but I think you deserve to know exactly what they're doing.
[01:52:28.534 --> 01:52:33.659]  I just created a free video presentation at 123fema.com that exposes the truth.
[01:52:34.139 --> 01:52:40.284]  Be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is FEMA must know something we don't.
[01:52:40.865 --> 01:52:50.894]  Go to 123fema.com to see the number one item to hoard and why supplies of this critical item are so low or even completely sold out already at many stores across America.
[01:52:51.454 --> 01:52:56.139]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in recent days.
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:01.745]  Go to 123fema.com and discover the number one item most critical in a crisis.
[01:53:02.146 --> 01:53:07.251]  Go watch my video now at 123fema.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:53:07.612 --> 01:53:08.833]  Again, that's 123fema.com.
[01:53:10.615 --> 01:53:17.421]  By now you know that wireless technology like cell phones do in fact pose dangers to the health and privacy of everyone.

[01:53:40.612 --> 01:53:41.812]  You know about RVs.
[01:53:42.012 --> 01:53:43.253]  You've heard about bunkers.
[01:53:43.473 --> 01:53:46.013]  But surviving is not recreation.
[01:53:46.213 --> 01:53:48.734]  And man wasn't made to live underground.
[01:53:48.974 --> 01:53:50.974]  Introducing Survivalist Camps.

[01:54:07.718 --> 01:54:09.038]  survivalistcamps.com
[01:54:11.061 --> 01:54:14.864]  Hey, did you hear that Ted Cruz is now part of the new Caddyshack movie?
[01:54:14.884 --> 01:54:15.885]  Here's a clip of it.
[01:54:15.925 --> 01:54:18.367]  He plays Spalding, Judge Schmell's nephew.
[01:54:18.387 --> 01:54:19.108]  I don't do it, kid.
[01:54:19.128 --> 01:54:33.300]  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don
[01:54:42.829 --> 01:54:58.400]  So, I don't like to do a bunch of comedy stuff here or get into gross humor, but Rubio, who is reportedly at bubble parties and his best buddy's arrested, you know, arrested with gay porn production companies and they're arrested outside bathrooms and the issue's blackmail.
[01:54:59.581 --> 01:55:03.944]  And then, you've got him talking about Trump's manhood
[01:55:05.508 --> 01:55:06.873]  What is going on with this?
[01:55:07.214 --> 01:55:08.901]  I mean, this is like a train wreck.
[01:55:09.041 --> 01:55:09.965]  Doug, what do you think is happening?
[01:55:09.985 --> 01:55:10.728]  We're going to go back to calls.
[01:55:11.894 --> 01:55:19.998]  Just quickly, I mean, it's a reflection of the, to me it's a reflection of our society, of the degradation of our society.
[01:55:20.319 --> 01:55:23.540]  I mean, you know, when we start comparing hands, okay, what is that?
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:28.303]  It goes back to boxers or briefs back in the days of, what, Clinton.
[01:55:28.983 --> 01:55:39.649]  And it's just a progressive slide down this moral morass that's being implemented through the Tavistockian mentality, you know, that's in play today.
[01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:49.661]  It's getting the majority of Americans to focus on the shiny trinkets as opposed to what's really important in life.
[01:55:49.901 --> 01:55:58.432]  It's in addition to being soft work humor and gross and really just outside the bounds of decency.
[01:55:59.389 --> 01:56:02.473]  Well, I mean, that's just, it is what it is.
[01:56:02.533 --> 01:56:04.134]  It's unfortunate and it's sad.
[01:56:05.236 --> 01:56:05.636]  Absolutely.
[01:56:05.656 --> 01:56:15.827]  I want to talk to you in the next segment about the Bundy situation and that's escalating with more arrests around the country and arresting members of the press, who I wouldn't really say were really press because I followed it.
[01:56:16.468 --> 01:56:17.609]  They're using that mantle.
[01:56:17.909 --> 01:56:20.630]  It's dangerous because then that can be extended to all the press.
[01:56:20.991 --> 01:56:26.093]  And I think it's wrong that they're throwing the book at some of these people that clearly aren't a danger.
[01:56:26.514 --> 01:56:28.855]  Some of them might need to be in a mental institution for a while.
[01:56:28.955 --> 01:56:33.818]  But again, this is a very dangerous situation and it's escalating very, very fast.
[01:56:34.278 --> 01:56:36.419]  And they're torturing these people in solitary confinement.
[01:56:36.439 --> 01:56:37.140]  We're going to get to that.
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:41.882]  But right now, let's go to the next caller who has been holding the longest.
[01:56:41.962 --> 01:56:42.763]  Ken in Wyoming.
[01:56:42.783 --> 01:56:43.363]  Thanks for holding.
[01:56:43.623 --> 01:56:44.184]  You're on the air.
[01:56:44.204 --> 01:56:44.484]  Go ahead.
[01:56:45.595 --> 01:56:47.076]  Hello, Alex, how you doing?
[01:56:47.336 --> 01:56:48.117]  Good, brother, go ahead.
[01:56:49.238 --> 01:56:55.102]  Yeah, I'm teaching from the school system here, and I'm in the social studies class.
[01:56:55.162 --> 01:56:57.343]  We've been listening to you all morning with my students.
[01:56:58.264 --> 01:57:00.465]  We've been following the debate and everything here.
[01:57:01.366 --> 01:57:02.847]  We saw the debate last night.
[01:57:03.528 --> 01:57:07.010]  Trump was being tromped on by all of the people, even Meg Ryan.
[01:57:07.951 --> 01:57:12.494]  I think that they're scared of the establishment being overthrown.
[01:57:13.556 --> 01:57:17.077]  And it's an example of what I've been doing.
[01:57:17.137 --> 01:57:22.719]  I'm an ex-submarine sailor, and I've known about the establishment takeover for 40 years.
[01:57:23.779 --> 01:57:34.022]  I've started a project here in Wyoming that I have been blocked by the establishment in creating jobs using agricultural techniques.
[01:57:34.643 --> 01:57:41.825]  I'm an ex-FFA student, and I have put in a project to the FDA.
[01:57:44.281 --> 01:57:51.787]  Oh yeah, they don't want people to know basic agriculture.
[01:57:51.807 --> 01:57:53.448]  They want that phased out and only big agro.
[01:57:53.488 --> 01:57:55.330]  It's part of the domestication process.
[01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:59.053]  But it's great to have a teacher like you actually breaking down what's happening.
[01:57:59.073 --> 01:58:02.716]  What do your students think about the debates and what they're seeing unfold?
[01:58:12.679 --> 01:58:13.640]  Some of his rhetoric.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:17.281]  But they do believe that he's a patriot, same as I do.
[01:58:17.922 --> 01:58:26.006]  And the reason why I want Trump in there is so maybe I can get some of my projects in the agriculture industry going to stop the poisoning.
[01:58:26.727 --> 01:58:27.947]  They're biospheres.
[01:58:28.067 --> 01:58:31.048]  They continue to clean up the environment.
[01:58:31.068 --> 01:58:32.609]  People will have a good place to work.
[01:58:32.929 --> 01:58:35.990]  We need to go back to real agriculture, not chemical agriculture.
[01:58:36.010 --> 01:58:38.131]  You ought to send me a paper on what you're doing.
[01:58:38.171 --> 01:58:38.931]  Attention, Alex Jones.
[01:58:38.991 --> 01:58:41.592]  Maybe we should have you on as a guest sometime on the show, The Nightly News.
[01:58:41.612 --> 01:58:42.672]  We want to say hi to your students.
[01:58:42.992 --> 01:58:44.673]  You got a great guy there in Ken.
[01:58:45.413 --> 01:58:45.933]  Stay with us.
[01:58:45.993 --> 01:58:46.694]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:46.734 --> 01:58:48.554]  More calls straight ahead with Doug Hackman.
[01:58:49.235 --> 01:58:50.195]  Jesse Ventura's coming up too.
[01:58:51.550 --> 01:58:53.314]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:54.797 --> 01:58:56.982]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:00.831 --> 01:59:01.651]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:59:01.812 --> 01:59:02.192]  Good, brother.
[01:59:02.372 --> 01:59:04.073]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:59:04.093 --> 01:59:05.854]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:59:06.034 --> 01:59:10.036]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:59:10.056 --> 01:59:12.637]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:59:12.677 --> 01:59:14.899]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:59:15.099 --> 01:59:22.943]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:59:23.263 --> 01:59:26.387]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:59:26.507 --> 01:59:28.009]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:59:28.049 --> 01:59:30.952]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:59:31.092 --> 01:59:32.454]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:59:32.734 --> 01:59:38.040]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:41.401]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:25.851 --> 02:00:27.273]  We are on the march.
[02:00:27.673 --> 02:00:30.096]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:00:30.816 --> 02:00:34.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:36.322]  Doug Hackman's our guest final segment.
[02:00:36.342 --> 02:00:37.783]  Jesse Ventura coming up to talk election 2016.
[02:00:37.864 --> 02:00:39.685]  We'll continue with your calls.
[02:00:40.466 --> 02:00:43.349]  Eamon Bundy says, jail, most difficult thing I've ever done.
[02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:46.332]  Finally after months in there, he's talked to the Oregonian.
[02:00:47.593 --> 02:00:48.835]  He's in solitary confinement.
[02:00:48.875 --> 02:00:50.156]  No clocks, no windows.
[02:00:50.196 --> 02:00:51.477]  Does not know what time of day it is.
[02:00:53.218 --> 02:00:54.980]  Doesn't deserve to be in that, obviously.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.802]  It is political torture.
[02:00:57.863 --> 02:01:02.527]  So, just because the Bundys, I think, did some silly things and romanticized all this...
[02:01:03.956 --> 02:01:05.817]  And had a few infiltrators come and provocateur.
[02:01:06.318 --> 02:01:08.359]  Now they've arrested 16 more people yesterday.
[02:01:08.379 --> 02:01:09.820]  That's over 60 people total.
[02:01:10.321 --> 02:01:11.662]  And I've read some of these indictments.
[02:01:12.162 --> 02:01:16.325]  It's like saying that Cliven Bundy was brandishing guns and stuff.
[02:01:16.365 --> 02:01:21.890]  And then they say, at the standoff with the feds, and they marked the day where the feds backed off.
[02:01:23.831 --> 02:01:26.653]  He was back miles away and didn't even have a gun.
[02:01:27.174 --> 02:01:27.894]  So they're lying.
[02:01:28.014 --> 02:01:30.976]  And they're just waiting until they, I guess, give them deprivation.
[02:01:32.023 --> 02:01:34.745]  From any human contact long enough till they'll say whatever they want.
[02:01:35.326 --> 02:01:38.228]  So they can start a new war on everybody's property out west, what's left of it.
[02:01:38.248 --> 02:01:42.952]  And they're already grabbing private property that's been held for hundreds of years in people's hands in Texas.
[02:01:43.552 --> 02:01:45.033]  Feds are just showing up saying we're taking it.
[02:01:45.373 --> 02:01:46.835]  We got automatic weapons, so.
[02:01:47.991 --> 02:01:49.212]  That's just the way it goes.
[02:01:49.252 --> 02:01:55.136]  Your take on that, Doug, it seems like a real dangerous escalation where a lot of these people are innocent.
[02:01:55.996 --> 02:01:57.958]  Some of them, other ones, act unstable.
[02:01:59.299 --> 02:02:03.842]  But I have seen very few people, you know, say we're ready to die, we're ready to kill people.
[02:02:04.242 --> 02:02:05.523]  I've seen a few of them say that.
[02:02:05.603 --> 02:02:10.366]  So maybe out of 60, and I've been following this, maybe two or three did actually make these statements.
[02:02:10.406 --> 02:02:14.429]  But my God, Black Lives Matter makes statements like that constantly in all these other groups.
[02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:17.733]  I guess there's just a hatred of patriots.
[02:02:18.354 --> 02:02:19.616]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:02:20.016 --> 02:02:27.648]  If you carry a gun, a Bible, and an attitude favorable to the Constitution, then you're enemy number one.
[02:02:27.708 --> 02:02:28.228]  Peter Klinger.
[02:02:29.136 --> 02:02:29.556]  Exactly.
[02:02:30.117 --> 02:02:44.125]  But you know, it's funny, I really think the Bundy situation, what happened in Oregon, and then what happened before, and these arrests, it's my understanding, these arrests are stemming back from the initial Nevada 2014.
[02:02:45.626 --> 02:02:46.167]  Right, right.
[02:02:46.247 --> 02:03:10.626]  So it's obvious to me, number one, that the Department of Justice and the BLM and every other government agency involved, including the IRS, they are now taking to the offensive and they will round up the people, whether or not, I mean, they're going to round up everyone who was involved and assess their guilt later, of course, but after a period of isolation and of incarceration.
[02:03:10.967 --> 02:03:13.489]  But the one thing that you said, and I've been really paying
[02:03:13.929 --> 02:03:14.850]  Very close attention to this.
[02:03:14.890 --> 02:03:17.171]  I mean, look at the Asian provocateurs here.
[02:03:17.972 --> 02:03:34.702]  They are attempting, when I say they, I'm talking about the powers that control this, are attempting to insinuate and infiltrate these organizations, put in these people who will provoke situations, and then, of course, something does happen.
[02:03:35.382 --> 02:03:57.618]  But the result, and I think this is the most important thing, the result of this is to take every new media platform, whether it's yours, ours, or whoever, and reclassify it, of course, according to, not just the MIAC report, but a broader scope of, of, of, of, of, well, broader, by, by, by, Just demonize it and claim it has no free speech rights.
[02:03:58.178 --> 02:03:59.220]  That's exactly right.
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:01.062]  They have to shut us up.
[02:04:01.463 --> 02:04:05.728]  And it's a lot easier to do it through the legal process, so to speak.
[02:04:05.788 --> 02:04:06.229]  Sure, that's it.
[02:04:06.249 --> 02:04:14.740]  They're heating up for persecution of gun owners and land rights groups while arming all these federal agencies and just having them just hatefully treat citizens.
[02:04:15.501 --> 02:04:22.444]  I mean, families at national parks and stuff, these armed guys show up and walk around and look at you with hate, like bullies.
[02:04:23.024 --> 02:04:29.667]  You know, you'd see as a teenager or something, and you're like, wow, you really look at everybody like you hate us.
[02:04:29.727 --> 02:04:33.709]  And they'll just smile at you with... They're really hiring classic criminal thugs.
[02:04:33.869 --> 02:04:36.390]  I'm sorry to say, they're hiring some really psychotic people.
[02:04:37.051 --> 02:04:37.651]  Real predators.
[02:04:37.931 --> 02:04:43.474]  Yeah, yeah, I mean... They're like bad guys out of an old western, where you... bad guys riding to town and they're pushing people around.
[02:04:43.494 --> 02:04:44.034]  I mean, it's like...
[02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:46.671]  Welcome to the old Wild West now.
[02:04:46.691 --> 02:04:47.791]  Yeah, I mean, walkin' my dog.
[02:04:48.212 --> 02:04:51.073]  I was stopped by a guy who wanted to see a dog license.
[02:04:51.173 --> 02:04:54.876]  And, I mean, crime is rampant, you know, elsewhere, but no.
[02:04:54.896 --> 02:04:57.477]  But see, the revenue generators... He wants to keep you in line, brother.
[02:04:57.497 --> 02:04:58.958]  We're gonna have you back up in the next two weeks.
[02:04:59.198 --> 02:04:59.819]  We ran out of time.
[02:04:59.839 --> 02:05:00.399]  You're awesome.
[02:05:00.619 --> 02:05:01.359]  Thank you, Doug Hagman.
[02:05:01.379 --> 02:05:02.060]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:03.020]  Jesse Ventura.
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:04.261]  See, this guy has no criminal record.
[02:05:04.301 --> 02:05:04.801]  Great guy.
[02:05:05.042 --> 02:05:06.482]  Trains law enforcement all over the country.
[02:05:06.863 --> 02:05:07.723]  Federal and state.
[02:05:07.983 --> 02:05:08.744]  And then, here they are.
[02:05:08.784 --> 02:05:09.564]  Where's your dog license?
[02:05:09.584 --> 02:05:10.665]  It's all about gettin' in your face.
[02:05:10.985 --> 02:05:11.465]  Extra!
[02:05:11.666 --> 02:05:12.146]  Extra!
[02:05:12.266 --> 02:05:13.066]  Read all about it!
[02:05:40.885 --> 02:05:41.605]  We're good to go.
[02:06:10.612 --> 02:06:11.072]  Hey, everyone!
[02:06:11.432 --> 02:06:17.293]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:06:17.553 --> 02:06:19.154]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:06:19.634 --> 02:06:29.556]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:06:29.916 --> 02:06:35.897]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:06:36.377 --> 02:06:53.219]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work,

[02:07:10.456 --> 02:07:16.842]  Our listeners over the past two years tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[02:07:17.293 --> 02:07:20.435]  I basically had my gallbladder out within the last nine months.
[02:07:20.455 --> 02:07:24.237]  I needed to get my digestive system working correctly again.
[02:07:24.337 --> 02:07:26.138]  So I stumbled on the X2.
[02:07:26.178 --> 02:07:26.998]  I needed a detox basically.
[02:07:41.047 --> 02:07:44.511]  I want to challenge the listeners who have not tried X2 for yourselves.
[02:07:44.711 --> 02:07:45.752]  What do you have to lose?
[02:07:46.032 --> 02:07:54.601]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[02:07:55.061 --> 02:07:58.885]  I noticed a significant change in my digestive flow.
[02:07:58.905 --> 02:08:00.426]  I was, like, really more natural.
[02:08:00.687 --> 02:08:06.292]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:08:06.312 --> 02:08:16.321]  It's never gonna get any better.
[02:08:16.722 --> 02:08:17.442]  Don't look for it.
[02:08:17.883 --> 02:08:18.964]  Be happy with what you got.
[02:08:20.111 --> 02:08:23.172]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[02:08:23.732 --> 02:08:25.373]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[02:08:25.773 --> 02:08:31.435]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[02:08:31.815 --> 02:08:33.035]  Forget the politicians.
[02:08:33.256 --> 02:08:36.537]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[02:08:38.117 --> 02:08:38.557]  You don't.
[02:08:39.338 --> 02:08:40.318]  You have no choice.
[02:08:40.698 --> 02:08:41.618]  You have owners.
[02:08:41.918 --> 02:08:42.859]  They own you.
[02:08:44.193 --> 02:08:45.494]  They own everything.
[02:08:45.714 --> 02:08:47.416]  They own all the important land.
[02:08:47.736 --> 02:08:49.478]  They own and control the corporations.
[02:08:49.518 --> 02:08:52.981]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[02:08:53.001 --> 02:08:54.582]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[02:08:54.903 --> 02:08:59.727]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[02:08:59.907 --> 02:09:01.529]  They got you by the balls!
[02:09:03.015 --> 02:09:05.077]  They want obedient workers.
[02:09:05.557 --> 02:09:07.058]  Obedient workers.
[02:09:07.378 --> 02:09:20.087]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[02:09:20.167 --> 02:09:23.409]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[02:09:23.869 --> 02:09:26.511]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[02:09:27.952 --> 02:09:28.813]  It's a big club.
[02:09:29.835 --> 02:09:30.876]  And you ain't in it.
[02:09:30.896 --> 02:09:36.201]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[02:09:36.541 --> 02:09:37.422]  You better believe it.
[02:09:37.522 --> 02:09:39.403]  So what specifically did they do?
[02:09:39.844 --> 02:09:44.988]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage, I've given to, just so you understand.
[02:09:45.008 --> 02:09:45.849]  A lot of money.
[02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:49.172]  You and I are not in the big club.
[02:09:49.532 --> 02:09:51.454]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[02:09:52.115 --> 02:09:55.818]  It's called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[02:09:57.222 --> 02:09:58.722]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[02:09:59.083 --> 02:10:02.564]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[02:10:02.604 --> 02:10:06.525]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[02:10:06.545 --> 02:10:07.485]  They're not interested in that.
[02:10:07.765 --> 02:10:08.705]  That doesn't help them.
[02:10:09.086 --> 02:10:10.466]  That's against their interest.
[02:10:10.966 --> 02:10:11.386]  That's right.
[02:10:11.646 --> 02:10:16.628]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:10:20.154 --> 02:10:25.858]  You can love him, you can hate him, but Jesse Ventura is known as one of the consummate political mavericks.
[02:10:26.818 --> 02:10:30.480]  They say he basically wrote the book that Arnold used to get elected as governor.
[02:10:30.501 --> 02:10:35.504]  And then of course now so many other politicians have modeled insurrection campaigns off of Jesse Ventura.
[02:10:36.184 --> 02:10:39.646]  He, of course, was an insurrectionist mayor, then, of course, a governor.
[02:10:39.886 --> 02:10:44.569]  He also was a top entertainment wrestler and movie star and best-selling author.
[02:10:45.009 --> 02:10:45.989]  And he joins us here.
[02:10:46.009 --> 02:10:47.010]  He's also a friend of mine.
[02:10:47.110 --> 02:10:52.493]  I was part of two seasons of his investigative report, Conspiracy Theory.
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:57.981]  And now we have Newt Gingrich coming out saying Donald Trump isn't part of the elite secret society.
[02:10:58.001 --> 02:10:58.881]  He's with a straight face.
[02:10:58.921 --> 02:10:59.841]  That's why they're after him.
[02:11:00.362 --> 02:11:02.782]  Well, Jesse Ventura's known him for multiple decades.
[02:11:02.802 --> 02:11:05.043]  They're friends, play golf, eat dinner, hang out.
[02:11:05.243 --> 02:11:09.104]  He said, you know, six months ago when I was looking into Donald Trump, he said, no, he's for real.
[02:11:09.344 --> 02:11:10.324]  It's exactly what you see.
[02:11:11.204 --> 02:11:12.684]  Now I know a bunch of people have known him forever.
[02:11:12.704 --> 02:11:14.905]  And I say, no, what you really see is Donald Trump.
[02:11:16.037 --> 02:11:18.539]  It is an incredible spectacle, but here's the bigger question.
[02:11:18.959 --> 02:11:21.241]  Will Jesse Ventura throw his hat in the ring and run?
[02:11:21.341 --> 02:11:29.907]  He has basically said, and we'll have him go into it in more detail, that if it's an establishment candidate like Hillary or Rubio, that it looks like a green light.
[02:11:30.267 --> 02:11:30.947]  How would that happen?
[02:11:30.987 --> 02:11:31.728]  Libertarian party?
[02:11:32.649 --> 02:11:39.153]  Because I like somebody like McAfee, but you know, the more serious candidate would be the Libertarian nomination, because they're in all 50 states on the ballot.
[02:11:39.173 --> 02:11:41.935]  You've got to have that ballot access, would be Jesse Ventura.
[02:11:42.435 --> 02:11:44.617]  And exactly, if there isn't a good candidate,
[02:11:45.734 --> 02:11:48.236]  Like a Donald Trump, you know it's establishment.
[02:11:48.856 --> 02:11:52.699]  That said, here he is hanging out with Richard N. Haas saying he likes to have the CFR.
[02:11:53.179 --> 02:11:54.820]  He's got Genrich endorsing him.
[02:11:55.081 --> 02:11:55.641]  I don't like that.
[02:11:56.462 --> 02:11:59.904]  But I'll be honest, the whole power structure is against Donald Trump.
[02:12:01.105 --> 02:12:06.308]  Ventura was on for a long time on CNN last night during the debate with their counter coverage, so he didn't get to see it.
[02:12:06.409 --> 02:12:07.389]  It was a bloodbath.
[02:12:08.730 --> 02:12:15.577]  Media packages like eight or nine of them against Trump, everyone ganging up, misrepresenting what he said and what he's done.
[02:12:15.597 --> 02:12:18.800]  I mean, they are scared of him for a reason.
[02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:20.021]  He is challenging the system.
[02:12:20.282 --> 02:12:23.125]  He's not spending money on the political punditry.
[02:12:23.725 --> 02:12:25.367]  He's not getting the big campaign money.
[02:12:25.867 --> 02:12:30.072]  It's like hearing Jesse Ventura talk, because this is everything Jesse has been
[02:12:31.445 --> 02:12:35.647]  Basically harping on, for decades, I never thought he was beating a dead horse.
[02:12:35.827 --> 02:12:37.348]  I was just waiting for the right time to come.
[02:12:38.328 --> 02:12:42.490]  And so no army can stop an idea whose time has come, to quote Victor Hugo.
[02:12:43.250 --> 02:12:44.731]  Jesse, so much happening.
[02:12:44.771 --> 02:12:46.312]  I got a lot of questions, a lot of comments.
[02:12:46.332 --> 02:12:47.792]  I want to play some of the debate clips.
[02:12:47.812 --> 02:12:48.453]  I want to play a clip.
[02:12:49.353 --> 02:12:54.557]  Of this campaign ad, Kasich, the warmonger, who acts like he's a sweet little old man, you know, is running.
[02:12:54.797 --> 02:12:56.378]  How dare Trump not want to have war?
[02:12:56.638 --> 02:12:57.479]  He's a tyrant.
[02:12:57.939 --> 02:13:00.121]  So he says, make America a tyranny again.
[02:13:00.761 --> 02:13:02.242]  I thought they're turning us into a tyranny.
[02:13:02.303 --> 02:13:04.104]  So that's coming up as well.
[02:13:04.684 --> 02:13:05.385]  Good to talk to you.
[02:13:06.309 --> 02:13:07.789]  Hi Alex, great to be here.
[02:13:07.849 --> 02:13:11.390]  Yeah, I went on CNN last night.
[02:13:11.450 --> 02:13:21.393]  I know the debates, I think, were on Fox or whatever, so probably not a lot of people heard what I had to say, but I brought up to them something that is really troubling to me.
[02:13:22.213 --> 02:13:23.813]  First of all, let me state this.
[02:13:23.953 --> 02:13:33.316]  With all the current candidates that you have out there and that have been out there within the last four to five months, I know a lot of them have dropped out, I have one thing.
[02:13:34.392 --> 02:13:36.173]  That none of them candidates have.
[02:13:37.173 --> 02:13:40.074]  I have one thing that Trump's money can't buy.
[02:13:40.094 --> 02:13:43.595]  I have one thing that none of these candidates have.
[02:13:43.635 --> 02:13:44.775]  You know what that is, Alex?
[02:13:44.795 --> 02:13:46.056]  Tell me.
[02:13:47.096 --> 02:13:54.478]  I have an honorable discharge from the United States Navy where I served from September the 11th, 1969 until September the 10th, 1975.
[02:13:54.559 --> 02:13:57.559]  Six years full on active duty, two years in the reserves.
[02:14:03.118 --> 02:14:09.445]  So, what I brought up last night on Don Lemon was something that disturbs me to no end.
[02:14:10.446 --> 02:14:21.777]  And that is that maybe I'll let these people off the hook because none of them were in the military, so maybe they're ignorant and they don't know about what I'm going to talk about.
[02:14:22.418 --> 02:14:23.279]  Maybe that's it.
[02:14:23.359 --> 02:14:24.120]  I'm not sure.
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:33.227]  But I brought up the fact that every Republican candidate right now has stated that they would commit a war crime.
[02:14:34.368 --> 02:14:38.852]  That if the situation arose, they would okay torture.
[02:14:39.032 --> 02:14:41.494]  They try to one-up each other on what they do.
[02:14:42.155 --> 02:14:45.638]  Well, and the point is, that is a war crime, Alex.
[02:14:46.199 --> 02:14:49.922]  If I did that as a member of the military and I took an oath,
[02:14:51.014 --> 02:14:55.117]  I would not receive an honorable discharge committing a war crime.
[02:14:55.137 --> 02:14:55.657]  I agree.
[02:14:55.917 --> 02:15:06.603]  How can the alleged leader of the military openly admit that he or she would commit war crimes?
[02:15:06.683 --> 02:15:07.564]  Are you kidding me?
[02:15:08.837 --> 02:15:11.638]  And nobody in the media jumps on that.
[02:15:11.899 --> 02:15:21.904]  Well it's probably a good thing you didn't watch because you're friends with... I guess it's bad to have David Duke endorse you or whatever, but that's out of your control.
[02:15:22.704 --> 02:15:33.890]  But to sit and openly state, Trump included, that they would commit war crimes and they're going to be commander-in-chief of the U.S.
[02:15:33.970 --> 02:15:34.570]  military?
[02:15:35.985 --> 02:15:39.908]  And I'm astounded the media doesn't even bring that up.
[02:15:40.968 --> 02:15:46.652]  Doesn't question them to the level they're questioning them on these other issues.
[02:15:47.073 --> 02:16:01.743]  I'm glad you raised this because that's my biggest issue with Trump is, you know, he has Hayden who was involved in all sorts of illegal stuff and authorizing torture, illegal spying, former head of the NSA, former head of the CIA, going on Bill Maher's show.
[02:16:03.344 --> 02:16:08.951]  And saying, oh, he couldn't be president because the military won't follow his orders to do illegal things.
[02:16:09.271 --> 02:16:11.334]  They've got most of the military following orders.
[02:16:11.394 --> 02:16:16.580]  And Trump showed a very tyrannical edge when he said, don't worry, I'm a leader.
[02:16:16.821 --> 02:16:18.263]  The troops will follow my orders.
[02:16:18.743 --> 02:16:20.305]  And unfortunately, a lot of them would.
[02:16:20.325 --> 02:16:25.570]  I know he wants to, quote, get tough on ISIS and stuff, but you don't get tough on them lowering yourself to their level.
[02:16:25.590 --> 02:16:30.976]  So I like, on one hand, he says we shouldn't be in Syria, we shouldn't have war with Russia, we shouldn't have created ISIS.
[02:16:31.456 --> 02:16:40.946]  He tells the truth about 9-11 and Saudi Arabia and does great things, but then he flips over and says, you know, we'll go after the wives of terrorists.
[02:16:41.026 --> 02:16:42.828]  It's just, what do you think of that, sir?
[02:16:43.479 --> 02:16:44.879]  Well, that's ridiculous.
[02:16:44.899 --> 02:16:50.360]  You're asking, you're putting a person who took an oath like I did in the United States military.
[02:16:51.461 --> 02:16:53.941]  Obviously the President's not gonna do it.
[02:16:54.501 --> 02:16:58.202]  It's gonna be brutes on the ground that will be asked to torture people.
[02:16:59.162 --> 02:17:00.863]  Or to kill innocent people.
[02:17:02.063 --> 02:17:03.143]  And how dare them?
[02:17:04.003 --> 02:17:06.844]  How dare them when they've never served themselves?
[02:17:07.719 --> 02:17:23.951]  They've never been in a position where their life was on the line, serving their country, and here they would ask people who have put their lives on the line, who have taken that oath, to now go out and commit war crimes at their behest?
[02:17:24.891 --> 02:17:31.396]  Since you raised this, and have people commit war crimes?
[02:17:31.416 --> 02:17:35.479]  I mean, this sounds like something that would be in the elections of 1930 Germany.
[02:17:38.405 --> 02:17:38.925]  Absolutely.
[02:17:38.965 --> 02:17:40.746]  Well, they actually kept stuff like that secret there.
[02:17:40.946 --> 02:17:47.709]  Joe Biggs, who was written about in Esquire and Vanity Fair, profiled by the late, great Hastings, Michael Hastings.
[02:17:47.749 --> 02:17:49.049]  In fact, I wonder if he's here right now.
[02:17:49.069 --> 02:17:52.891]  I want to drag him in the control room next break to talk to Ventura briefly.
[02:17:52.951 --> 02:17:54.891]  He's an Army veteran.
[02:17:54.911 --> 02:17:56.072]  He was at three or four tours.
[02:17:56.912 --> 02:17:59.273]  We've got Purple Hearts and Discharge Honorable.
[02:17:59.353 --> 02:18:04.075]  He says he doesn't really feel guilty because he didn't really understand what was happening at the time, but later he did.
[02:18:04.635 --> 02:18:06.616]  They would order him to go pick people up.
[02:18:07.176 --> 02:18:14.938]  They would take him to the DEA and the CIA in Afghanistan, and then they would sometimes torture him to death because there'd be a dead body the next day.
[02:18:14.958 --> 02:18:23.320]  And he took him to people to be tortured to death, no judge, no jury, and that was about controlling the opium, which we know went way up under our government.
[02:18:23.681 --> 02:18:30.262]  So right there, that's somebody boots on the ground, many times going to pick people up to take them to be tortured to death.
[02:18:30.882 --> 02:18:36.164]  Yes, and that falls directly to the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief.
[02:18:36.877 --> 02:18:38.980]  The President of the United States.
[02:18:39.902 --> 02:18:48.415]  And when the President condones committing war crimes, the United States and its people should hang their head in shame.
[02:18:49.289 --> 02:18:59.371]  Because, fine, you're fighting terrorists, you're fighting people that are probably not very good people, but we should always hold ourselves to a higher standard.
[02:18:59.611 --> 02:19:01.071]  Well, that's what George Washington said.
[02:19:01.151 --> 02:19:02.451]  The British did a lot of atrocities.
[02:19:02.471 --> 02:19:03.792]  It's one reason the public turned against them.
[02:19:04.172 --> 02:19:09.933]  Washington hung members of the colonial military if they got caught engaging in any war crimes.
[02:19:11.053 --> 02:19:11.873]  Absolutely.
[02:19:12.313 --> 02:19:16.294]  You have to hold yourself to a higher standard to be on the side of right.
[02:19:17.946 --> 02:19:19.887]  And let me put it to you this way.
[02:19:20.547 --> 02:19:23.568]  All of these candidates, they can get away with it.
[02:19:23.588 --> 02:19:25.249]  They're not going to be put in danger.
[02:19:25.329 --> 02:19:31.512]  When they tell you that they're going to support torture, that puts our military in danger.
[02:19:31.592 --> 02:19:37.334]  Remember when Bush let people get prosecuted who followed orders of torture, and then he didn't get in trouble?
[02:19:38.175 --> 02:19:53.139]  Absolutely, but it gets our men and women in danger because if they're captured or anything happens to them, well, if we torture, what right do we have to complain if our young men and women in service get caught and tortured?
[02:19:53.179 --> 02:19:55.099]  There's a reason society develops chivalry.
[02:19:55.119 --> 02:19:57.600]  It's because you don't want stuff happening to your wives and children and you don't.
[02:19:57.620 --> 02:19:59.300]  Well, and there's something else too.
[02:19:59.701 --> 02:20:01.281]  There's something called honor.
[02:20:02.282 --> 02:20:07.750]  And when you take the oath to serve in the United States military, you take an oath of honor.
[02:20:08.090 --> 02:20:11.134]  And torture and war crimes are not honor.
[02:20:11.194 --> 02:20:11.655]  Powerful!
[02:20:11.675 --> 02:20:12.035]  Stay there!
[02:20:12.175 --> 02:20:12.576]  Stay there!
[02:20:12.616 --> 02:20:13.137]  Bad enough.
[02:20:13.337 --> 02:20:14.599]  Now they're adding ammonia?
[02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:15.880]  It's true.
[02:20:15.961 --> 02:20:19.886]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:20:20.106 --> 02:20:21.927]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:20:22.488 --> 02:20:26.971]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:20:27.271 --> 02:20:39.860]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[02:21:11.656 --> 02:21:12.976]  Hi, my name is Nick Lupo.
[02:21:13.276 --> 02:21:16.357]  One World Way has been by far the best protein that I've ever had.
[02:21:16.537 --> 02:21:17.817]  I take it three times a day.
[02:21:18.157 --> 02:21:23.538]  Once in the morning as soon as I wake, once for a pre-workout snack, and once for a post-workout recovery drink.
[02:21:23.658 --> 02:21:26.939]  It has helped me transform and sculpt my body into what I have now.
[02:21:27.199 --> 02:21:32.220]  I began taking the product about two years ago, and boy, let me tell you, I'm in the best shape of my life.
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:35.900]  I've seen major muscle mass gains and have 0% body fat.
[02:21:36.060 --> 02:21:40.261]  I've had people at my gym ask if I compete in bodybuilding because of how lean and muscular I am.
[02:21:40.521 --> 02:21:46.764]  I used to suffer from everyday aches and pains from hard manual labor my whole life, and arthritis that runs through my family.
[02:21:46.984 --> 02:21:50.805]  But One World Way has helped me take that everyday pain from a 10 to a 3.
[02:21:51.266 --> 02:21:53.887]  Some days I feel no pain at all, just full of life and energy.
[02:21:54.107 --> 02:21:56.988]  It has also helped my skin look younger and healthier.
[02:21:57.208 --> 02:21:59.829]  Thank you, Synergistic Nutrition, for One World Way.

[02:24:06.866 --> 02:24:09.228]  From the Robert Allen System, current returns not indicative of future results.
[02:24:11.383 --> 02:24:13.584]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:24:13.604 --> 02:24:16.965]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:20.467 --> 02:24:21.767]  Jesse Ventura's our guest.
[02:24:21.887 --> 02:24:24.968]  Biggs is walking down towards the studio right now to just tell his story briefly.
[02:24:24.988 --> 02:24:34.112]  I want to shift gears in the next segment out of torture and war, but since Jesse Ventura raises all this, he's really got a good point.
[02:24:34.232 --> 02:24:36.693]  It's almost like we've gotten broke back about this.
[02:24:37.173 --> 02:24:38.854]  I made a big deal about this under Bush.
[02:24:39.833 --> 02:24:42.396]  And it was all secret then, we had to prove torture was going on.
[02:24:42.896 --> 02:24:44.858]  Now they're just like, I'll torture everybody!
[02:24:44.959 --> 02:24:46.440]  I'll kill even more people!
[02:24:46.841 --> 02:24:48.042]  I'm John Wayne!
[02:24:48.562 --> 02:24:53.087]  And the weird part about it is, it's like Hillary bragging, I came, I saw, Gaddafi died.
[02:24:53.107 --> 02:24:57.492]  Or her bragging about killing people, or Obama saying I'm good at killing people.
[02:24:58.092 --> 02:25:01.076]  It's really weird to see somebody that's never killed anybody.
[02:25:02.310 --> 02:25:03.490]  Sit there and brag about it.
[02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:08.392]  And the people I know that have killed a lot of people, I got family members from Special Operations, you name it.
[02:25:09.552 --> 02:25:10.793]  One of them was in 35 years.
[02:25:11.813 --> 02:25:13.614]  And I mean, on the ground stuff.
[02:25:14.394 --> 02:25:19.676]  And you know, he became obviously an officer and got pretty high level, but they'll never tell you any of the stories.
[02:25:19.776 --> 02:25:21.896]  And boy, every once in a while, they're horrible.
[02:25:22.197 --> 02:25:23.277]  And they don't like talking about them.
[02:25:23.936 --> 02:25:28.837]  But it's these wimpy people that really enjoy the idea of death and killing.
[02:25:29.437 --> 02:25:38.219]  And studying history, when you get an elite like that, like Rome in its decline, had these rulers that had never been in combat, but were into cruelty and evil, it's crazy.
[02:25:38.879 --> 02:25:44.000]  And then after the break, I have that clip where they say that Trump's for tyranny because he doesn't want war.
[02:25:44.081 --> 02:25:47.001]  And Kasich and all them will bloody the Russians' nose.
[02:25:47.061 --> 02:25:48.922]  We need Russian body bags.
[02:25:48.982 --> 02:25:50.182]  Blow up their airplanes.
[02:25:51.242 --> 02:25:53.524]  And the Russians are literally doing nothing to anybody.
[02:25:54.565 --> 02:25:57.547]  Jesse, you were just over in Russia at a big press dinner a few months ago.
[02:25:57.587 --> 02:26:00.189]  Your interview here on that went viral.
[02:26:00.609 --> 02:26:02.390]  I want to bring Joe Biggs in since he's here.
[02:26:02.410 --> 02:26:08.795]  Joe, just briefly tell Governor Ventura, it's a short segment, I don't know if you were listening earlier, just your experience bringing people for torture.
[02:26:09.855 --> 02:26:27.153]  Yeah, we would go out on missions in Afghanistan and we'd have these OGA guys with us, other government agencies, and we would go and do tactical site exploitations, clear houses where there were IED bomb-making facilities, and essentially we'd take these guys back.
[02:26:27.754 --> 02:26:37.997]  And these OGA guys would come in and interrogate them, and we'd sit outside the little compound out in the Coast Province, and we would sit there, and you could hear the screams and yells, and it was pretty intense.
[02:26:38.418 --> 02:26:39.578]  And that stuff happened a lot.
[02:26:39.598 --> 02:26:41.178]  Some people came out, some people didn't.
[02:26:41.659 --> 02:26:41.999]  You know?
[02:26:42.219 --> 02:26:47.040]  And we would be told to go guard opium fields, and sometimes we'd be told to take them out.
[02:26:47.681 --> 02:26:51.762]  It was depending whether or not these farmers would play ball with the military.
[02:26:52.270 --> 02:27:02.300]  Now, you could argue, hey, they got bombs, they're planning to blow somebody up, we gotta torture them to find out who they're gonna kill next, that's the Machiavellian idea, but then our own government's growing the opium, and then funding ISIS, and now it's worse than ever.
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:13.091]  Well, they were more concerned with protecting those opium fields than they were actually detaining and interrogating these IED-making facility places, these people that were operating.
[02:27:13.432 --> 02:27:14.273]  These guys would
[02:27:14.713 --> 02:27:18.038]  Get captured and then essentially released not that long after.
[02:27:18.399 --> 02:27:24.208]  It's the ones who weren't going to play ball with the opium pills, those are the ones who would get it the most because that's where the most money was made.
[02:27:28.726 --> 02:27:36.652]  Well, you know, the more I hear about these wars, both Afghanistan and Iraq and all that, I'll just say this.
[02:27:37.392 --> 02:27:40.514]  You know, I had a young man who I kind of tutored.
[02:27:40.554 --> 02:27:42.155]  He went into the Navy SEALs.
[02:27:42.215 --> 02:27:43.296]  He went to Iraq.
[02:27:43.336 --> 02:27:43.997]  He came back.
[02:27:44.037 --> 02:27:45.638]  He actually brought me something.
[02:27:46.438 --> 02:27:47.098]  We're good to go.
[02:28:05.410 --> 02:28:14.008]  And, uh, you know, what I'm watching in these wars, when people tell me to ask me if a war is justified, it's a real simple answer to me.
[02:28:14.048 --> 02:28:16.573]  A war is justified if you're willing to send your son.
[02:28:17.521 --> 02:28:20.603]  If you're not willing to send your son, how do you send someone else's?
[02:28:21.084 --> 02:28:26.147]  And I would not send my son over there for these wars because they're total BS.
[02:28:26.908 --> 02:28:30.471]  They're just like Smedley Butler wrote in his book, War is a Racket.
[02:28:31.051 --> 02:28:32.712]  This is a classic example of it.
[02:28:33.153 --> 02:28:40.178]  And then hearing this from the veteran himself who's over there, seeing and hearing that we are torturing people,
[02:28:40.798 --> 02:28:46.264]  Well, how do we then look at them and condemn them if we're doing the same thing?
[02:28:46.324 --> 02:28:46.744]  Exactly!
[02:28:46.804 --> 02:28:49.487]  How is North Korea bad for torturing, but then we're not?
[02:28:50.208 --> 02:28:50.949]  Exactly!
[02:28:51.169 --> 02:28:57.996]  I mean, if we don't hold ourselves to a standard and have some type of honor, then what is it all really about?
[02:28:59.867 --> 02:29:02.989]  It's amazing, and Joe, you told me a lot of these stories, a lot of them got written about you.
[02:29:03.009 --> 02:29:04.831]  You were saying this was pretty much routine.
[02:29:05.751 --> 02:29:09.454]  You were over there a couple years in Afghanistan and then Iraq, or back and forth.
[02:29:09.514 --> 02:29:14.778]  I mean, how many times would you say you took people, you know, scooped them up to take them to be, quote, interrogated?
[02:29:15.649 --> 02:29:20.612]  I mean, in Afghanistan alone, probably, I don't know, about a dozen times or more.
[02:29:21.253 --> 02:29:23.434]  Somewhere in there, Iraq, not as much.
[02:29:23.514 --> 02:29:30.619]  Iraq, I was mostly just, like he said, like Governor Ventura said, you couldn't tell who the enemy was in Iraq.
[02:29:30.659 --> 02:29:32.460]  You just drove around waiting to be blown up.
[02:29:33.001 --> 02:29:37.584]  And then, you know, you're looking around and there's kids and there's a bazaar and there's families running around.
[02:29:37.604 --> 02:29:41.266]  You have no idea who it is shooting at you or pushing the trigger to blow you up.
[02:29:41.626 --> 02:29:42.207]  It was intense.
[02:29:42.247 --> 02:29:42.847]  It was insane.
[02:29:42.867 --> 02:29:45.149]  It was horrible every day.
[02:29:46.109 --> 02:29:48.270]  That's just one thing if you've got somebody you know you're going to fight them.
[02:29:48.290 --> 02:29:50.450]  I couldn't imagine just constantly not knowing where it is.
[02:29:50.470 --> 02:29:52.031]  It's just crazy.
[02:29:52.071 --> 02:29:52.451]  Thank you.
[02:29:52.671 --> 02:29:58.792]  You know, again, that tells me it's completely identical to Vietnam because in Vietnam you have the VC.
[02:29:59.272 --> 02:30:00.012]  Exactly, Governor.
[02:30:00.052 --> 02:30:00.332]  Stay there.
[02:30:00.352 --> 02:30:01.193]  We're going to break.
[02:30:01.313 --> 02:30:03.093]  We're going to come right back.
[02:30:03.133 --> 02:30:03.613]  Long segment.
[02:30:03.993 --> 02:30:06.654]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.013 --> 02:30:11.894]  He's an outsider.
[02:30:11.914 --> 02:30:12.534]  He's not them.
[02:30:12.574 --> 02:30:13.655]  He's not part of the club.
[02:30:14.095 --> 02:30:15.897]  He's uncontrollable.
[02:30:15.917 --> 02:30:18.118]  He hasn't lived through the initiation rites.
[02:30:18.178 --> 02:30:19.859]  He didn't belong to the secret society.
[02:30:19.940 --> 02:30:25.844]  That was former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich explaining why the Republican establishment is so scared of Donald Trump.
[02:30:26.164 --> 02:30:36.810]  Gingrich would know about secret societies, given his affiliation with Bohemian Grove, although he could also be speaking of the Skull and Bones Club, which is notorious for its initiation rituals.
[02:30:37.090 --> 02:30:46.295]  So far, Trump has played the role of outsider, and people are loving him for it, but he has held private briefings with some secret society types, like Richard Haass.
[02:30:46.435 --> 02:30:49.036]  Haass is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:30:49.216 --> 02:30:53.639]  He's also a member of the influential Trilateral Commission and a Bilderberg attendee.
[02:30:54.039 --> 02:31:01.304]  Earlier this week, a number of prominent neocons released an open letter stating their opposition to the candidacy of Donald Trump.
[02:31:01.625 --> 02:31:03.186]  Haas did not sign the letter.
[02:31:03.386 --> 02:31:06.208]  Could Richard Haas be one of Trump's potential cabinet picks?

[02:33:22.117 --> 02:33:28.401]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.942 --> 02:33:33.604]  Jesse Ventura is our guest, shattering the left-right paradigm.
[02:33:33.624 --> 02:33:34.524]  We're getting more into the debate.
[02:33:34.564 --> 02:33:35.785]  Your phone call's here in a few minutes.
[02:33:37.146 --> 02:33:43.490]  But the governor and Biggs were talking during the break, and I'd forgotten to get Biggs to tell the story about his captain.
[02:33:43.950 --> 02:33:45.451]  He was a staff sergeant.
[02:33:47.208 --> 02:33:51.310]  Now a colonel, once he came to work here and was talking about this stuff, the phone call he got.
[02:33:52.010 --> 02:33:55.852]  So Joe Biggs, relay that story to Governor Ventura so he can respond.
[02:33:56.432 --> 02:34:02.995]  Yeah, so when I was in the 82nd Airborne, I had this captain, I can't remember his name right now, especially after that conversation I got about two years ago.
[02:34:03.015 --> 02:34:04.736]  I kind of blocked the guy out of my memory.
[02:34:05.737 --> 02:34:07.558]  I started working here, yeah, about two years ago.
[02:34:07.578 --> 02:34:15.901]  When I get a call, I'm actually out on Red River in downtown Austin with McBreen and some of the guys here in the crew and getting some pizza, walking around.
[02:34:15.941 --> 02:34:16.562]  My phone rings.
[02:34:17.242 --> 02:34:24.244]  And, uh, I pick it up and this guy goes, oh, I don't know if you remember me, um, I used to be a captain, uh, blah, blah, blah, on the 82nd Airborne.
[02:34:24.284 --> 02:34:25.624]  And I go, oh, okay, I remember.
[02:34:25.644 --> 02:34:27.745]  And he goes, yeah, I'm a colonel now in the Army.
[02:34:27.825 --> 02:34:31.766]  And, uh, you know, what you're doing right now, it's truly and honestly disgusting.
[02:34:31.806 --> 02:34:32.606]  You're a disgrace.
[02:34:33.266 --> 02:34:37.487]  Um, you need to shut the F up and stop talking about what you're doing.
[02:34:37.907 --> 02:34:42.190]  You are giving soldiers a bad name, speaking out about what's going on.
[02:34:42.550 --> 02:34:49.054]  I've heard your reports about Afghanistan, what's going on with the opium, shut up, stop it, you know, basically like that.
[02:34:49.114 --> 02:34:50.535]  And it went on for about 30 minutes.
[02:34:51.095 --> 02:34:54.417]  And, you know, I hang up the phone and McBrain's looking at me, he's like, man, what just happened?
[02:34:54.437 --> 02:34:55.477]  That looked like an intense call.
[02:34:55.497 --> 02:35:01.381]  And I was like, man, this guy just basically threatened me, told me to shut up for what I was talking about at InfoWars.
[02:35:01.401 --> 02:35:03.482]  So, I mean, that was super intense.
[02:35:03.562 --> 02:35:04.623]  It came out of nowhere.
[02:35:05.529 --> 02:35:06.610]  Well, it's sad.
[02:35:06.850 --> 02:35:17.895]  And as I explained, it's difficult to be a whistleblower because people you know and people that are involved with you, many of them will view you as a traitor.
[02:35:17.915 --> 02:35:18.155]  Oh, yeah.
[02:35:18.815 --> 02:35:22.657]  And many of them will, you know, just be very hostile.
[02:35:22.677 --> 02:35:24.658]  And that's what makes being a whistleblower.
[02:35:25.338 --> 02:35:28.840]  It's a difficult thing that takes a great deal of courage.
[02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:30.661]  And I always respect someone
[02:35:31.362 --> 02:35:33.064]  When I was in Afghanistan...
[02:35:47.708 --> 02:35:55.292]  Yeah, when I was in Afghanistan, there was a reporter there, well-known combat journalist Michael Hasings, and he asked me a question in one of the interviews.
[02:35:55.332 --> 02:35:57.353]  He goes, what do you think about the Taliban here?
[02:35:57.373 --> 02:36:00.454]  What do you think about these people who want to kill you?
[02:36:00.994 --> 02:36:03.475]  And I said, I have a great deal of respect for them.
[02:36:03.536 --> 02:36:04.536]  I was like, guess what?
[02:36:04.896 --> 02:36:06.037]  We're flying over here.
[02:36:06.117 --> 02:36:07.337]  We're bombing the hell out of them.
[02:36:07.677 --> 02:36:08.418]  We're shooting at them.
[02:36:08.438 --> 02:36:10.379]  We're blowing them up for our own reasons.
[02:36:11.079 --> 02:36:16.381]  What would you do if you were sitting in your backyard and paratroopers started falling out of the sky in your homeland?
[02:36:16.421 --> 02:36:21.702]  People started attacking you, and you're just sitting there like, alright, well I've got to pick up arms and defend myself.
[02:36:21.782 --> 02:36:29.124]  I said, I don't blame them for wanting to kill me, but at the same time, I'm going to protect my men that are with me and make sure we get home.
[02:36:29.504 --> 02:36:32.505]  But at the same time, I can respect them for doing what they're doing as well.
[02:36:32.745 --> 02:36:33.285]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:36:34.006 --> 02:36:40.109]  Interesting testimony, but the point is it's known opium production went from 3% to 93% within two years of us being there.
[02:36:40.409 --> 02:36:47.113]  It's known they're torturing people, so why call up and tell them to shut up when it's his birthright to have free speech, Jesse?
[02:36:47.633 --> 02:36:51.796]  Well, of course it is, but you know, we don't live in a... we remember something.
[02:36:51.836 --> 02:36:55.218]  We don't live in an era anymore where the Bill of Rights matters.
[02:36:57.170 --> 02:37:03.074]  You and I have talked about it thousands of times, Alex, how the Bill of Rights is trampled.
[02:37:03.454 --> 02:37:05.676]  They have no regard for it whatsoever.
[02:37:06.576 --> 02:37:10.339]  So it doesn't surprise me that free speech is the first.
[02:37:11.619 --> 02:37:13.581]  Why wouldn't they take that down also?
[02:37:13.641 --> 02:37:15.402]  Now it's selective speech, I guess.
[02:37:16.758 --> 02:37:21.939]  I want to play you a couple clips since you missed the debate, and we haven't played these yet, so the listeners want to hear these.
[02:37:23.260 --> 02:37:24.260]  I know you like Putin.
[02:37:24.380 --> 02:37:26.481]  You've been over there for a big press dinner in Mannington.
[02:37:26.501 --> 02:37:33.523]  Well, I don't necessarily like him, but I respect him and I met him briefly, and I'd certainly love to sit down and talk with him more.
[02:37:33.543 --> 02:37:34.563]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:37:35.223 --> 02:37:36.384]  I like the straight shooting.
[02:37:36.424 --> 02:37:39.006]  I like the fact he's defending the family, national sovereignty.
[02:37:39.026 --> 02:37:41.868]  I don't see Russia involved in any of our interests.
[02:37:41.968 --> 02:37:43.289]  Russia's not doing anything to America.
[02:37:43.689 --> 02:37:45.090]  It's the globalists that are doing it.
[02:37:45.130 --> 02:37:46.291]  They're the ones taking my rights.
[02:37:46.691 --> 02:37:47.131]  I agree.
[02:37:47.352 --> 02:37:48.352]  And so I don't put words in your mouth.
[02:37:48.372 --> 02:37:49.453]  The point is you respect Putin.
[02:37:50.354 --> 02:37:53.256]  He's got two overseas military bases where people invited him in.
[02:37:53.276 --> 02:37:53.756]  We have over 300.
[02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:56.281]  We're in 100 plus countries.
[02:37:57.201 --> 02:38:08.689]  So it's super ridiculous to say, bloody their nose, Trump's a traitor because he says he knows Putin and would try to work with him and be friends and have business relations between our countries.
[02:38:09.109 --> 02:38:09.650]  Why not?
[02:38:10.740 --> 02:38:14.404]  And so this is what John Kasich put out.
[02:38:15.345 --> 02:38:17.747]  This is the video they put out.
[02:38:18.128 --> 02:38:21.892]  Trump, Putin, 2016, make tyranny great again.
[02:38:22.312 --> 02:38:26.937]  So they're acting like Trump and Putin are the threat, not the tyrants that are pushing all this.
[02:38:27.477 --> 02:38:28.739]  Here is the Kasich TV ad.
[02:38:30.854 --> 02:38:36.275]  In a stunning development, today Donald Trump announced his running mate, Russian President Vladimir Putin.
[02:38:36.695 --> 02:38:37.856]  He was my stablemate.
[02:38:37.996 --> 02:38:39.256]  I believe I'll get along with him.
[02:38:39.736 --> 02:38:41.697]  It was Trump and Putin, Putin and Trump.
[02:38:41.877 --> 02:38:48.578]  The decision would be illegal and unconstitutional, but not unexpected in light of Mr. Trump's recent pro-Putin rhetoric.
[02:38:49.399 --> 02:38:51.559]  Do you like Vladimir Putin's comments about you?
[02:38:51.579 --> 02:38:52.499]  Sure.
[02:38:52.719 --> 02:38:54.680]  When people call you brilliant, it's always good.
[02:38:55.419 --> 02:38:59.062]  Vladimir Putin welcomed the news and only had glowing words to say for Trump.
[02:38:59.302 --> 02:39:02.005]  He is a brilliant and talented person without a doubt.
[02:39:02.405 --> 02:39:08.010]  If elected, Trump promised that the dictatorial duo would, quote, make tyranny great again.
[02:39:08.030 --> 02:39:11.953]  I think I'd get along very well with Vladimir Putin.
[02:39:12.694 --> 02:39:13.294]  I just think so.
[02:39:14.896 --> 02:39:17.578]  And they say that he's running for office, will they make tyranny great again?
[02:39:17.798 --> 02:39:19.740]  And what the hell is wrong with that?
[02:39:22.455 --> 02:39:26.667]  You know, all these other guys, all they want to do is fight war.
[02:39:29.619 --> 02:39:33.481]  Well, they're not even good at it in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:39:33.521 --> 02:39:38.543]  We can't go to war with Russia or China who have ICBMs, just who Clinton gave to them.
[02:39:38.623 --> 02:39:39.643]  I mean, to those Chinese.
[02:39:40.123 --> 02:39:40.964]  I just don't understand.
[02:39:41.504 --> 02:39:47.267]  What is Russia doing to us except not letting the West take the satellite countries around it and put missiles on its border?
[02:39:47.647 --> 02:39:48.687]  Exactly.
[02:39:49.247 --> 02:39:55.530]  You know, I'd rather have someone who can talk to Vladimir Putin than someone who ignores him and attacks him.
[02:39:55.550 --> 02:39:57.291]  Kasich said we need to bloody their nose.
[02:39:58.237 --> 02:40:07.804]  Well, here you got another guy who never served in the military, who's making these military decisions because he doesn't have to do it.
[02:40:08.705 --> 02:40:11.547]  You know, I think it's time to elect a veteran.
[02:40:12.587 --> 02:40:16.170]  We haven't had a veteran in the White House for a long, long time.
[02:40:16.750 --> 02:40:19.512]  Well, certainly in a combat event like JFK.
[02:40:19.892 --> 02:40:20.873]  JFK was a hero.
[02:40:20.913 --> 02:40:23.455]  He was blown up, you know, in that PT boat fighting a battleship.
[02:40:23.795 --> 02:40:25.576]  Well, even Nixon served!
[02:40:25.977 --> 02:40:26.117]  Yeah.
[02:40:26.894 --> 02:40:36.144]  You know, but I think personally it is time we get a veteran, and it doesn't mean you gotta be a war hero or you gotta be anything like that.
[02:40:36.444 --> 02:40:41.329]  Just someone who has gone on with their life, taken the oath,
[02:40:42.623 --> 02:40:45.427]  And stood ready to give their life for their country.
[02:40:45.467 --> 02:40:48.170]  There were a lot of candidates that did that.
[02:41:00.649 --> 02:41:03.330]  Well, I'm getting back to it, Alex.
[02:41:03.490 --> 02:41:13.575]  It's time to elect a veteran instead of not- and someone that knows what it's like to take an oath and to be prepared to die for your country.
[02:41:14.116 --> 02:41:18.118]  None of these presidential candidates right now have ever did that.
[02:41:18.578 --> 02:41:18.998]  None of them.
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:24.301]  Well, Eisenhower warned us about the military-industrial complex.
[02:41:24.441 --> 02:41:34.863]  I mean, we buy multi-billion dollar jet fighters that the Pentagon admits isn't even as good as a $10 million or $15 million F-15 that's 25 years old.
[02:41:35.423 --> 02:41:36.843]  I mean, we are being screwed over.
[02:41:37.503 --> 02:41:49.026]  Alex, not only that, we continue to build these aircraft carriers that are sitting duck targets for the countries out there that have ballistic missiles.
[02:41:50.111 --> 02:41:51.392]  Well, yeah, it's cruise missiles.
[02:41:51.473 --> 02:41:52.874]  Yeah, cruise missile, take it out.
[02:41:52.894 --> 02:41:53.915]  It's called treason.
[02:42:07.631 --> 02:42:10.592]  You know, it's wasteful.
[02:42:10.632 --> 02:42:11.872]  Here's what I believe, Alex.
[02:42:12.392 --> 02:42:15.253]  We have enough problems in our own country right now.
[02:42:15.633 --> 02:42:19.914]  We need to start focusing on fixing up the United States of America.
[02:42:19.934 --> 02:42:24.256]  Does Flint, Michigan ring a bell?
[02:42:24.336 --> 02:42:24.736]  Exactly.
[02:42:24.756 --> 02:42:25.276]  We're falling apart.
[02:42:25.296 --> 02:42:26.076]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:42:26.096 --> 02:42:27.296]  I want it in your own words.
[02:42:27.316 --> 02:42:30.677]  I saw a newspaper article, but I don't trust newspapers half the time they lie.
[02:42:31.517 --> 02:42:32.918]  Where are you on running for president?
[02:42:33.058 --> 02:42:36.819]  What is the climate or what is the circumstances that will induce you to run?
[02:42:38.021 --> 02:42:43.442]  Well, right now, it's about a 30-day window I have, roughly, to inform.
[02:42:43.822 --> 02:42:47.043]  I've been in contact with the Libertarian Party.
[02:42:47.103 --> 02:43:01.666]  They have formally invited me to their convention in Orlando, and that's where they give out their nomination, or, you know, support, and you go on the ballot as the Libertarian's choice for president.
[02:43:03.001 --> 02:43:17.986]  It's totally personal now for me whether I want to get involved at that level and go 24-7 and put myself through what a campaign from June to November would do to me and my family.
[02:43:19.778 --> 02:43:37.908]  But right now, I don't see anybody out there... Bernie Sanders, I talked with him a couple days ago, and he unequivocally told me that if he loses, which chances are he's going to, he's done a remarkable thing, but Hillary's got the superdelegates, so that's the fix.
[02:43:39.009 --> 02:43:42.991]  And if Bernie loses, he is going to endorse Hillary.
[02:43:43.751 --> 02:43:46.433]  Which, to me, stops the revolution.
[02:43:48.349 --> 02:43:53.530]  How do you get on board with somebody you've just accused of being owned by Wall Street?
[02:43:54.551 --> 02:43:57.011]  Who is stealing the popular vote with superdelegates?
[02:43:57.272 --> 02:44:00.392]  Well, yeah, and here's what I think they got in mind.
[02:44:01.133 --> 02:44:08.274]  Let me project this out, because with these two parties, you notice all the candidates agree they'll support whoever the party chooses.
[02:44:08.655 --> 02:44:11.515]  Well, that shows loyalty to the party, not the country.
[02:44:12.236 --> 02:44:13.816]  That shows they're true colors.
[02:44:13.856 --> 02:44:15.036]  They're loyal to their party.
[02:44:15.056 --> 02:44:17.377]  That's why George Washington won a political party's band.
[02:44:18.104 --> 02:44:18.744]  Exactly.
[02:44:19.624 --> 02:44:22.285]  But the thing is, here's what I think's gonna happen, Alex.
[02:44:22.905 --> 02:44:29.346]  I think Sanders will lose, and then he will endorse Hillary, and Hillary may take him as the VP.
[02:44:31.267 --> 02:44:39.729]  And that way, it'll attempt to bring the Sanders people in line with the Clinton people, and if that happens, they certainly will defeat the Republican.
[02:44:40.409 --> 02:44:43.630]  Yeah, because if they don't bring Sanders in, a lot of his people are gonna go Trump.
[02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:44.230]  They've said that.
[02:44:44.290 --> 02:44:45.030]  The polls show that.
[02:44:45.956 --> 02:44:49.940]  Well, I don't know if they're going to go Trump necessarily, but here's where I sit.
[02:44:50.801 --> 02:44:55.646]  Where would the Sanders people prefer to go, and where would the Trump people prefer to go if they don't make it?
[02:44:55.946 --> 02:44:57.247]  To a Jesse Ventura?
[02:44:57.428 --> 02:44:58.148]  To a libertarian?
[02:44:58.168 --> 02:44:59.450]  Truly a centrist?
[02:45:00.425 --> 02:45:01.286]  I'm in the middle.
[02:45:01.707 --> 02:45:03.509]  I don't need to go to the far left.
[02:45:03.589 --> 02:45:05.151]  I don't need to go to the far right.
[02:45:05.192 --> 02:45:06.754]  That's how I won Minnesota.
[02:45:07.294 --> 02:45:10.358]  The Republican Norm Coleman had to appease the far right.
[02:45:10.839 --> 02:45:13.042]  Skip Humphrey had to appease the far left.
[02:45:13.462 --> 02:45:15.325]  I had the center, which wins it.
[02:45:15.685 --> 02:45:17.408]  They couldn't get back in the middle.
[02:45:17.768 --> 02:45:33.216]  Well, let me tell you, they know you could win and certainly were in the position to win until they ran the political assassination, character assassination things that you were, stop drunk driving when you were in another state wasn't true, that you, you know, that you were heavy naval stuff.
[02:45:33.256 --> 02:45:36.818]  First of all, the courts still haven't rendered a decision.
[02:45:36.858 --> 02:45:38.759]  The appeals court, we're still waiting.
[02:45:39.435 --> 02:45:42.298]  And the second is, that's getting behind me.
[02:45:42.358 --> 02:45:43.579]  People now know the truth.
[02:45:43.779 --> 02:45:44.660]  People know the truth.
[02:45:44.700 --> 02:45:45.480]  No, I know.
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:46.221]  I've noticed that.
[02:45:46.241 --> 02:45:47.442]  So that lie is wearing off.
[02:45:47.462 --> 02:45:48.083]  That's good news.
[02:45:48.123 --> 02:45:50.685]  But what I'm saying is they did that because they know you're a contender.
[02:45:50.705 --> 02:45:52.787]  Oh, they're already doing it now.
[02:45:53.007 --> 02:45:54.428]  I rattled my shoulder.
[02:45:54.468 --> 02:46:01.995]  Marco Rubio came up here and pulled me in and said that I'm an embarrassment to the state of Minnesota, an embarrassment today.
[02:46:03.609 --> 02:46:04.730]  So they're already shooting at you?
[02:46:05.010 --> 02:46:06.631]  Oh, they're shooting at me already!
[02:46:06.651 --> 02:46:22.843]  They're shooting, and I laughed, and I, you know, on the Rubio thing, and I said an embarrassment, and he's a follower of, and he said I'm an embarrassment like Trump, who came out of entertainment, and it shows what a hypocrite he is, because he says he's a follower of Ronald Reagan.
[02:46:23.243 --> 02:46:28.707]  Well, excuse me, if he were old enough to know, Ronald Reagan came from entertainment too.
[02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:31.741]  You know what I call Rubio?
[02:46:31.761 --> 02:46:32.562]  He's the spineless puppet.
[02:46:32.602 --> 02:46:33.042]  He's up there...
[02:46:46.488 --> 02:46:48.890]  He's totally controlled by the Wizard of Oz.
[02:46:48.930 --> 02:46:49.630]  He's a puppet.
[02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:54.173]  He's who the puppets have put forward to controlling people who want to win.
[02:46:54.193 --> 02:46:57.375]  They want Rubio because he's nothing but a puppet.
[02:46:57.875 --> 02:46:58.155]  I agree.
[02:46:58.175 --> 02:46:59.316]  Now let me inject this question.
[02:46:59.396 --> 02:47:10.123]  I read in the newspaper report that I covered yesterday that you, to paraphrase, you said, look, if it's not Sanders or it's not Trump, if it's not an anti-establishment candidate, I'm going to run probably as a libertarian.
[02:47:10.483 --> 02:47:11.624]  And then you got 30 days to do it.
[02:47:11.744 --> 02:47:13.565]  Specifically, you're saying what
[02:47:15.847 --> 02:47:17.868]  I mean, are you leaning 64, 40 against?
[02:47:18.468 --> 02:47:20.909]  It's 50-50 right now.
[02:47:23.530 --> 02:47:24.770]  It's 50-50 right now.
[02:47:25.351 --> 02:47:33.713]  I want to see who wins these final March things, so we're pretty sure then who the two candidates are going to be, but you never know.
[02:47:34.374 --> 02:47:38.535]  I mean, they could go to that convention and they could take it right away from Donald if they want to.
[02:47:38.555 --> 02:47:40.436]  I was about to say, would you run against Donald Trump?
[02:47:41.076 --> 02:47:41.336]  Sure.
[02:47:43.095 --> 02:47:49.406]  If I choose to run and he's the Republican candidate, I run against Republicans and Democrats regardless of who I'm against.
[02:47:49.426 --> 02:47:53.353]  No, I understand, but surely the Trump thing is an anti-establishment run.
[02:47:54.720 --> 02:47:58.242]  That's true, but maybe a lot of anti-establishment.
[02:47:58.282 --> 02:48:02.283]  You know, Donald still supports, you know, torturing people.
[02:48:02.303 --> 02:48:06.285]  He's going to blow up and exploit the wars more.
[02:48:06.965 --> 02:48:14.108]  All of these candidates... So you've gone from a month ago saying you like Donald, but his torture comments are pushing you over the edge to maybe ready to run up against him.
[02:48:14.328 --> 02:48:16.589]  Well, not just that, but his war comments.
[02:48:16.729 --> 02:48:18.270]  They're all going to go to war again.
[02:48:19.125 --> 02:48:20.326]  I'm sick of these wars.
[02:48:20.426 --> 02:48:21.367]  I want out of there.
[02:48:21.407 --> 02:48:28.753]  I want to bring... And I'll tell you what, if they want to put walls at the borders, bring all our troops home and let the troops go.
[02:48:28.773 --> 02:48:29.194]  Sure, sure.
[02:48:29.214 --> 02:48:31.316]  But in fairness to Trump... Because we don't want to be racist.
[02:48:31.556 --> 02:48:35.759]  In fairness to Trump, he's against Libya, against Syria, against having war with Russia.
[02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:40.143]  I think the tough guy talk is rhetoric because he knows what the Republican audience is like.
[02:48:40.383 --> 02:48:41.725]  They think torture is really tough.
[02:48:42.665 --> 02:48:43.746]  Well, whatever.
[02:48:43.966 --> 02:48:45.728]  I can only go by what he says.
[02:48:45.788 --> 02:48:51.392]  And if he's just doing that to win the Republicans over, then that doesn't carry weight with me.
[02:48:51.432 --> 02:48:51.913]  No, I hear you.
[02:48:51.933 --> 02:48:55.055]  What do you think of the CFR head meeting with him?
[02:48:56.036 --> 02:48:56.816]  Who's that now?
[02:48:57.197 --> 02:48:58.498]  Richard N. Haas met with him.
[02:48:59.198 --> 02:49:00.940]  Newt Gingrich has basically endorsed him now.
[02:49:02.093 --> 02:49:03.054]  Have endorsed Trump?
[02:49:03.294 --> 02:49:04.075]  Yeah, I don't like that.
[02:49:04.256 --> 02:49:05.437]  Yeah.
[02:49:05.917 --> 02:49:07.659]  Well, that's the Republican Party.
[02:49:07.679 --> 02:49:09.341]  They're gonna do what they're gonna do.
[02:49:09.421 --> 02:49:16.149]  See, I think that if, you see, if I were to run, Alex, I would say it doesn't matter who they run.
[02:49:16.169 --> 02:49:18.332]  They're still the Republicans and the Democrats.
[02:49:18.452 --> 02:49:18.952]  Absolutely.
[02:49:18.993 --> 02:49:20.214]  Jesse, let me shift gears then.
[02:49:21.357 --> 02:49:25.358]  Well, I'd say that the United States needs to stop being the major force of war throughout the world.
[02:49:25.398 --> 02:49:29.079]  Because every war that happens now, we're involved in it.
[02:49:29.159 --> 02:49:29.620]  In one way or another.
[02:49:29.660 --> 02:49:30.200]  And I'm sick of it.
[02:49:51.632 --> 02:49:57.175]  Again, I'll follow the teachings of the two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner, General Smedley Butler.
[02:49:57.195 --> 02:50:01.337]  Our troops shouldn't go over 500 miles from our shoreline.
[02:50:01.377 --> 02:50:16.264]  They should be for protecting the United States of America, not being involved in regime overthrows, and invading and occupying other countries, and going to Afghanistan to make sure the opium is getting out like it should.
[02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:19.361]  Let me crystallize this, and I want to go to phone calls for you, sir.
[02:50:19.421 --> 02:50:21.403]  I'm skipping this network break so we have more time.
[02:50:21.423 --> 02:50:23.764]  I'm going to take a moment and plug here in a second before we go to calls.
[02:50:24.244 --> 02:50:25.065]  The callers get ready.
[02:50:26.005 --> 02:50:29.787]  I don't want to have, you know, an emotional debate with you.
[02:50:29.807 --> 02:50:33.489]  We've had real discussions many times over dinner or on the road with the TV show and before that.
[02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:35.751]  But I want to be serious here about where I stand.
[02:50:36.851 --> 02:50:39.073]  We haven't replaced our population.
[02:50:39.233 --> 02:50:40.153]  We need to bring in people.
[02:50:40.854 --> 02:50:44.095]  I love, you know, folks that are coming from Latin America, people that are coming from China.
[02:50:44.235 --> 02:50:44.656]  Great people.
[02:50:45.695 --> 02:50:49.958]  Um, I don't like being groped at the TSA, being checked.
[02:50:50.998 --> 02:50:54.700]  Uh, I don't like, when I come to the border, getting a third degree, everything searched.
[02:50:54.720 --> 02:51:01.724]  When I flew back in from Cancun, the last two times, two hour flight direct from Austin back, you would think that Attila the Hun was coming through.
[02:51:01.744 --> 02:51:02.464]  Yep.
[02:51:02.725 --> 02:51:03.625]  So, so here's the deal.
[02:51:03.725 --> 02:51:06.907]  Go ahead and open the borders up completely, but I'm going to be left alone too.
[02:51:07.267 --> 02:51:09.889]  What I'm saying is, don't leave the borders open.
[02:51:10.649 --> 02:51:15.273]  I mean, they admit they got flights coming in all over the country where they don't even check the IDs of people under Obama's orders.
[02:51:15.594 --> 02:51:18.376]  They're bringing in Muslim refugees who they don't even check or vet them.
[02:51:18.416 --> 02:51:19.117]  That's confirmed.
[02:51:19.457 --> 02:51:30.928]  So all I'm saying is, vet the people, check they're not criminals, and then treat citizens at least as good as you treat people, because I get being nice to the third world people and we need hard workers.
[02:51:31.488 --> 02:51:35.910]  But they are bringing them in to kind of make them a political voting block, give them voter IDs.
[02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:46.914]  I just hope you can see the other side of the issue as well and see where Trump is right to say, hey, you got to vet people and if you're not going to check their IDs at least, you got to stop it all until you're doing it.
[02:51:47.154 --> 02:51:49.515]  The media misrepresents what he says so often.
[02:51:49.715 --> 02:51:50.695]  You're right about the torture.
[02:51:51.355 --> 02:51:52.856]  And I mean, that is wrong.
[02:51:53.156 --> 02:51:53.976]  And he did say that.
[02:51:54.016 --> 02:51:56.057]  But on the other stuff, they're twisting what he said.
[02:51:56.823 --> 02:51:58.003]  Well, that may be so.
[02:51:58.264 --> 02:52:00.504]  My belief on immigration is simply this.
[02:52:00.584 --> 02:52:02.845]  If we're tired of immigrants, then let's stop it.
[02:52:03.606 --> 02:52:04.186]  Altogether.
[02:52:04.546 --> 02:52:08.527]  See, the problem with immigration is you can't have gray area.
[02:52:08.948 --> 02:52:11.048]  You either gotta have white or black.
[02:52:11.248 --> 02:52:12.109]  It's that simple.
[02:52:12.149 --> 02:52:18.691]  You either have immigration fully, you can't just eliminate certain people from it, or you have none.
[02:52:19.111 --> 02:52:23.033]  And it seems to me we're to the point where we're ready to say we don't want no both.
[02:52:23.053 --> 02:52:25.034]  Sure, but see, now you're going to the extreme example.
[02:52:25.094 --> 02:52:25.934]  Please, I know, come on.
[02:52:26.654 --> 02:52:27.315]  I see your point.
[02:52:27.355 --> 02:52:28.916]  Get rid of the Statue of Liberty, Alex.
[02:52:28.936 --> 02:52:29.576]  Bring the Tribsham.
[02:52:29.877 --> 02:52:30.877]  I'm not having an argument with you.
[02:52:30.897 --> 02:52:31.938]  I agree with a lot of what you're saying.
[02:52:32.238 --> 02:52:37.743]  What I'm saying is, at Ellis Island, they kept you for three months to make sure you didn't have TB.
[02:52:38.043 --> 02:52:43.787]  They let people in with HIV and TB now, and then they shut whole schools down in Austin, and the kids are getting it.
[02:52:44.027 --> 02:52:48.130]  You can't bring a 12-year-old with TB and stick them next to my kids.
[02:52:48.411 --> 02:52:53.414]  I'm saying it's so extreme with the left, they'll bring somebody in, Governor, with drug-resistant TB.
[02:52:53.454 --> 02:52:54.115]  Now, come on.
[02:52:54.495 --> 02:52:55.956]  You agree they should be checked, right?
[02:52:56.456 --> 02:52:57.197]  Absolutely.
[02:52:57.437 --> 02:52:58.017]  Well then good!
[02:52:58.037 --> 02:53:00.059]  Then bring them in after the checks!
[02:53:00.479 --> 02:53:05.762]  We need to check to see if it was Monsanto that created the new Zika virus.
[02:53:05.902 --> 02:53:07.243]  I agree, absolutely, sir.
[02:53:07.303 --> 02:53:11.045]  Because they went down there and spread a bunch of chemicals in the water.
[02:53:11.346 --> 02:53:13.867]  Mosquitoes don't normally carry viruses.
[02:53:13.887 --> 02:53:15.048]  They attract them.
[02:53:16.084 --> 02:53:17.325]  You're right, the effect on that top side is on.
[02:53:17.345 --> 02:53:20.867]  They're doing it to the mosquitos and now the mosquitos are giving it to us.
[02:53:20.947 --> 02:53:23.909]  You're right, I think a lot of scientists think they mutated because of the chemicals, you're right.
[02:53:24.329 --> 02:53:27.611]  Yeah, and yet they don't, you don't hear that reported, do you?
[02:53:27.852 --> 02:53:31.294]  They're doing to the mosquitos what they're doing to the gun.
[02:53:32.154 --> 02:53:39.339]  They're blaming the gun for all these shootouts when the reality is it's the pharmaceutical drugs that the shooters have been put on.
[02:53:40.615 --> 02:53:47.600]  Oh, I saw a great, uh... There's your common denominator and they won't talk about it because you're not allowed to talk about pharma in the media.
[02:53:47.720 --> 02:53:48.100]  Oh, yeah.
[02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:55.205]  I was, they swore I was on three segments, Piers Morgan, highest ratings they ever had, and I'm sitting there, and I attacked Big Pharma the first segment.
[02:53:55.225 --> 02:53:56.305]  They go, don't do that again.
[02:53:56.325 --> 02:53:58.947]  The producers come over, they go, do not talk about our sponsors.
[02:53:59.487 --> 02:54:02.129]  And I came back on and did it, and they cut it, they cut it off.
[02:54:02.489 --> 02:54:04.050]  They said, that's it, get out of here.
[02:54:04.351 --> 02:54:09.134]  All because I said, you got Prozac ads during the commercials, and every one of the shooters has been on it.
[02:54:10.154 --> 02:54:13.398]  Well, then the point is they won't bring that out.
[02:54:13.478 --> 02:54:14.819]  They stop it at the gun.
[02:54:14.899 --> 02:54:15.901]  They blame the gun.
[02:54:16.521 --> 02:54:20.366]  Just like with this Zika virus, they're blaming the mosquito.
[02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:27.172]  They're not blaming the fact that chemicals allegedly were put into the water down there to kill the mosquitoes.
[02:54:27.692 --> 02:54:31.814]  Clearly it didn't work and the mosquitoes are passing this on now to humans.
[02:54:31.934 --> 02:54:32.274]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:32.294 --> 02:54:33.255]  We're going to go to calls here.
[02:54:33.295 --> 02:54:34.815]  Just one or two before you got to go.
[02:54:34.895 --> 02:54:36.076]  It's great to have you on.
[02:54:36.316 --> 02:54:38.297]  It'll be amazing if you run for president.
[02:54:38.717 --> 02:54:39.977]  I just can't wait to be able to cover that.
[02:54:39.997 --> 02:54:43.639]  Well, I just want to give, you know, people, I want to break this spell or two.
[02:54:43.699 --> 02:54:46.800]  Everybody thinks you have to elect a Democrat or Republican.
[02:54:46.900 --> 02:54:47.380]  Why?
[02:54:47.580 --> 02:54:48.180]  You're running.
[02:54:48.701 --> 02:54:49.601]  I can tell you're running.
[02:54:50.021 --> 02:54:50.421]  Why?
[02:54:50.441 --> 02:54:51.982]  Why do you have to elect them?
[02:54:52.242 --> 02:54:56.764]  Jesse, I sense more energy in you than in the ten years I've known you.
[02:54:57.065 --> 02:54:58.765]  You're more aggressive like you used to be.
[02:54:58.785 --> 02:55:00.326]  You're running for president, buddy.
[02:55:00.346 --> 02:55:01.467]  No, I ain't.
[02:55:01.947 --> 02:55:02.067]  I'm 50-50.
[02:55:02.207 --> 02:55:06.309]  I'm gonna watch what happens this month.
[02:55:06.449 --> 02:55:08.450]  No, I think you recognize history's happening.
[02:55:08.470 --> 02:55:11.932]  This is a special election and you want to be heard, bare minimum.
[02:55:11.952 --> 02:55:14.713]  You cannot lose when it comes to injecting real issues.
[02:55:15.174 --> 02:55:16.574]  And so I think you're running for president.
[02:55:18.682 --> 02:55:19.383]  I think you're doing it.
[02:55:20.083 --> 02:55:24.605]  Well, Alex, all I'll do with you on that is say, don't hold your breath on it.
[02:55:25.466 --> 02:55:26.847]  I can't hold it for 30 days.
[02:55:27.747 --> 02:55:30.429]  Promise me that I know you don't see it a lot.
[02:55:31.109 --> 02:55:32.770]  Alex, you're not a gray whale.
[02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:34.531]  You can't hold your breath that long.
[02:55:36.192 --> 02:55:40.234]  I wasn't a champion swimmer like you, but I didn't win blue ribbons in Dallas, so I ended up swimming.
[02:55:40.314 --> 02:55:41.655]  As long as I held my breath was two minutes.
[02:55:41.675 --> 02:55:43.596]  But listen, how long did you hold your breath in the seals?
[02:55:44.326 --> 02:55:44.946]  I don't know.
[02:55:44.966 --> 02:55:48.047]  We had to do 75 foot free dives, though.
[02:55:48.087 --> 02:55:52.048]  We had to go down 75 feet and get sand and bring it back to the surface.
[02:55:52.229 --> 02:55:53.629]  That's the farthest I've ever gone.
[02:55:53.649 --> 02:55:57.430]  I think I don't remember if we did 75 or if we actually did 100.
[02:55:57.510 --> 02:55:58.230]  I don't even recall.
[02:55:58.270 --> 02:55:59.771]  We did it at San Clemente Island.
[02:56:00.191 --> 02:56:00.391]  Yeah.
[02:56:00.491 --> 02:56:04.215]  Well, the secret is, you know, you pressurize so it oxygenates because it puts more pressure.
[02:56:04.235 --> 02:56:08.099]  So suddenly you go down 60, 70 feet, that's about the depth where you go, whoa, I can breathe.
[02:56:08.139 --> 02:56:09.059]  I mean, I feel good now.
[02:56:09.480 --> 02:56:10.561]  And then you've got to go over the side.
[02:56:10.581 --> 02:56:14.224]  But once you start going back up, it starts un-oxygenating and there's that panic, you know?
[02:56:14.925 --> 02:56:21.391]  So the secret's just to swim fast and grab the sand and don't let it get out of your hand before you've got to show it to the instructor.
[02:56:21.912 --> 02:56:23.313]  What about these freedivers that go down 1,400 feet?
[02:56:27.073 --> 02:56:27.995]  That's pretty amazing, huh?
[02:56:28.356 --> 02:56:29.779]  Oh, yeah.
[02:56:29.999 --> 02:56:32.244]  You know, I'm too old to do that stuff.
[02:56:32.284 --> 02:56:34.309]  No, actually, all of them that have done that have died.
[02:56:34.649 --> 02:56:37.054]  Everyone that goes to those deaths keeps doing it, and they all die.
[02:56:37.583 --> 02:56:38.423]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:56:38.443 --> 02:56:39.884]  Like I said, I'm 64.
[02:56:39.964 --> 02:56:41.445]  I can't swim like I used to.
[02:56:41.925 --> 02:56:42.926]  You know, we're just out of time.
[02:56:42.946 --> 02:56:45.207]  I'm going to have to go to James, everybody else after you go.
[02:56:45.307 --> 02:56:46.567]  I'm going to go into overdrive here.
[02:56:46.607 --> 02:56:47.408]  David Knight's coming up.
[02:56:47.428 --> 02:56:50.469]  But Jesse, so much more is happening in the world.
[02:56:50.849 --> 02:56:53.310]  The reason I would say run, I don't want you to kill yourself doing it.
[02:56:53.330 --> 02:56:54.351]  I know you've been through a lot.
[02:56:54.891 --> 02:56:57.072]  But I know if you ran, you would run to win.
[02:56:57.092 --> 02:57:00.674]  I love seeing the Trump phenomenon of a maverick.
[02:57:00.854 --> 02:57:02.255]  I know you're a real maverick.
[02:57:02.295 --> 02:57:03.135]  I have questions about Trump.
[02:57:03.175 --> 02:57:03.935]  I think he's a good guy.
[02:57:04.035 --> 02:57:04.776]  You say he's a good guy.
[02:57:05.456 --> 02:57:12.378]  I'm supporting him right now, but I would love for you to run just because of the bully pulpit you'd get, and I'd love to be able to, you know, let me know.
[02:57:12.398 --> 02:57:14.119]  I want to be there at that press conference when you announce.
[02:57:14.499 --> 02:57:29.883]  Okay, well, like I said, if I do it, I'm doing it to give people what I believe they're really seeking, and that's an alternative to the Democrats and Republicans, because if you elect a Democrat or Republican, you get the party with it, no matter what anybody says.
[02:57:30.404 --> 02:57:34.865]  Would you take, would you consider taking a position in a Trump administration?
[02:57:36.261 --> 02:57:47.184]  I probably doubt that because I, like Bernie Sanders endorsing Hillary, I don't ever want to lose my integrity and become part of those two parties in any way, shape, or form.
[02:57:47.204 --> 02:57:49.625]  Alright, I know you're working on two big books.
[02:57:49.685 --> 02:57:51.125]  I know the subjects, they are bombshell.
[02:57:51.145 --> 02:57:53.006]  I think this has been one of your most dangerous books ever.
[02:57:53.346 --> 02:57:54.346]  Look forward to talking to you then.
[02:57:54.386 --> 02:57:56.006]  And you know, this is such a hot period.
[02:57:56.086 --> 02:57:56.867]  One of them's not.
[02:57:56.987 --> 02:58:00.968]  One of the books I'll preview for you a little bit.
[02:58:01.028 --> 02:58:05.249]  I'm doing a book, it's entitled The Stupid Shit Politicians Say.
[02:58:07.537 --> 02:58:09.318]  The stupid bleep, yeah.
[02:58:09.699 --> 02:58:12.621]  And the other one is the big dangerous subject.
[02:58:12.981 --> 02:58:15.023]  Well, let's do this, since things are coming up.
[02:58:15.903 --> 02:58:17.785]  I'm going to be the first, but at least the second.
[02:58:18.325 --> 02:58:23.169]  I want to be right there at the trough, when or if you don't make the announcement, either way.
[02:58:23.189 --> 02:58:25.411]  Well, you know, you've been my friend too long.
[02:58:25.531 --> 02:58:28.033]  I'll give you the heads up, one way or another.
[02:58:28.638 --> 02:58:29.539]  Alright, that's awesome.
[02:58:29.619 --> 02:58:31.541]  I know you gotta go, so I'm gonna say bye to you at the end of the break.
[02:58:32.062 --> 02:58:33.083]  I'm gonna come back and take calls.
[02:58:33.123 --> 02:58:36.246]  Jesse Ventura, Off The Grid, TV show, books.
[02:58:36.587 --> 02:58:37.768]  Google the name Jesse Ventura.
[02:58:38.088 --> 02:58:39.910]  Jesse, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:58:40.311 --> 02:58:40.991]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:58:41.151 --> 02:58:46.838]  Always a pleasure and hi to everybody out there in InfoWorld land.
[02:58:47.919 --> 02:58:48.419]  You're awesome.
[02:58:48.439 --> 02:58:49.100]  Thank you, Jesse.
[02:58:49.160 --> 02:58:49.781]  We'll be back.
[02:58:49.841 --> 02:58:50.141]  Thank you.

[02:58:55.026 --> 02:58:56.268]  Stay with us.
[02:58:56.308 --> 02:58:57.329]  Welcome to InfoWars Land.
[02:58:57.369 --> 02:58:58.951]  That's the opposite of Zombie Land, isn't it?
[02:59:00.703 --> 02:59:03.904]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:59:04.225 --> 02:59:12.228]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:59:12.468 --> 02:59:17.490]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:59:17.890 --> 02:59:20.171]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[03:00:02.819 --> 03:00:14.491]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:18.875 --> 03:00:23.400]  They call us walking corpses, unholy living dead.
[03:00:24.813 --> 03:00:25.753]  They'd like to lock us up.
[03:00:25.773 --> 03:00:28.634]  On Corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:28.654 --> 03:00:53.382]  I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want to be in your... I don't want
[03:00:56.664 --> 03:01:00.705]  We gotta play a little bit more Misfits here on air, don't we?
[03:01:00.825 --> 03:01:02.145]  Listen to that voice at its prime.
[03:01:03.285 --> 03:01:04.086]  Better than Elvis!
[03:01:06.006 --> 03:01:08.386]  Not the evil Elvis, the better Elvis!
[03:01:08.466 --> 03:01:10.707]  That's right, better than Elvis.
[03:01:13.247 --> 03:01:15.908]  I don't wanna be in your British hell!
[03:01:16.048 --> 03:01:19.569]  No, I mean, Elvis' voice is probably even better, but this guy has better lyrics.
[03:01:21.089 --> 03:01:23.830]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Georgia.
[03:01:23.870 --> 03:01:24.830]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:01:27.100 --> 03:01:30.063]  Alex, thank you for all your work over the years.
[03:01:30.383 --> 03:01:39.250]  I just wanted to set this up first with a long time inside baseball, political family, grandfathered, good friends with JFK.
[03:01:40.031 --> 03:01:43.674]  He was a businessman like Trump and then turned politicians, United People.
[03:01:44.274 --> 03:01:47.196]  A father of special forces, trained in boating yards.
[03:01:47.657 --> 03:01:49.478]  Sure, your phone scrambled a little bit.
[03:01:49.518 --> 03:01:50.659]  Back off your phone a little bit.
[03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:52.601]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:01:53.101 --> 03:01:53.442]  Anyway,
[03:01:54.622 --> 03:01:59.884]  Father, special forces, train, moat and yards, you know, save lives, things like that, want to kill her.
[03:01:59.904 --> 03:02:01.964]  Know a lot of inside baseball.
[03:02:01.984 --> 03:02:09.507]  First of all, I want to say that this is special because it's the first time since the Constitution was created, I believe, that someone's been self-funded.
[03:02:10.067 --> 03:02:14.369]  Second of all, people should look instead of who's endorsing Trump to who's against him.
[03:02:14.629 --> 03:02:16.949]  Everybody's against him except the American voters.
[03:02:17.610 --> 03:02:18.310]  And third of all,
[03:02:19.511 --> 03:02:28.837]  Trump, everything is hollow until we address the problem of the war against the families and that's the divorce court and allowing children to only be raised by the state.
[03:02:29.318 --> 03:02:32.780]  Absolutely, everything is about destroying families and breaking things up.
[03:02:33.180 --> 03:02:41.566]  I've even talked to people in the system, the psychologists, the social workers, they say it's screwed up and it's anti-family and it's anti-father.
[03:02:41.626 --> 03:02:46.289]  In fact, I'm friends with one of the guys that actually got the father's, you know, bill of rights.
[03:02:46.849 --> 03:02:49.570]  And father's rights put in in Texas is now leading the country.
[03:02:50.711 --> 03:02:58.455]  And it's just amazing to see that even the insiders who have PhDs realize it's designed to destroy everybody.
[03:02:58.495 --> 03:02:58.935]  Great point.
[03:03:00.696 --> 03:03:05.979]  I just want to say to James for Harrison, I love you, son.
[03:03:05.999 --> 03:03:10.161]  I haven't seen you in years, and I'm still fighting for your body and Trump.
[03:03:10.700 --> 03:03:11.521]  Everything's hollow.
[03:03:11.641 --> 03:03:18.204]  Put in an executive order or something where it makes it a God-given right that a parent has to their child.
[03:03:18.485 --> 03:03:18.945]  Absolutely.
[03:03:18.965 --> 03:03:21.727]  Well, the state's coming in saying your kids belong to the state.
[03:03:22.267 --> 03:03:25.189]  And statistically, the state is the worst parent you can have.
[03:03:25.209 --> 03:03:27.930]  Unless there aren't some good people in the state.
[03:03:28.290 --> 03:03:29.971]  But I mean, overall, look at history.
[03:03:30.732 --> 03:03:33.754]  Let's look at all these foreign-run orphanages, Russia, the rest of it.
[03:03:33.774 --> 03:03:34.434]  I mean, give me a break.
[03:03:34.914 --> 03:03:37.116]  Mark in Kansas, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:03:37.136 --> 03:03:37.456]  Go ahead.
[03:03:39.082 --> 03:03:41.283]  Yes, thanks so much for the opportunity, Alex.
[03:03:41.944 --> 03:03:50.169]  A first time call from Kansas City, and I'm answering to something I read from Paul Joseph Watson, quoting him directly.
[03:03:50.449 --> 03:03:53.671]  The editorial's back, telling us... Sir, are you on a headset too?
[03:03:53.711 --> 03:03:55.132]  Because all these calls are overblown.
[03:03:56.313 --> 03:04:00.876]  I'm sorry, I'm not on a speakerphone, and maybe I will back off the microphone.
[03:04:00.896 --> 03:04:02.017]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:04:02.037 --> 03:04:03.398]  Does that help?
[03:04:03.678 --> 03:04:04.138]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:04:05.359 --> 03:04:06.740]  Paul Joseph Watson's article.
[03:04:07.563 --> 03:04:11.456]  That general panic tone again illustrates how not just a Republican establishment...
[03:04:12.014 --> 03:04:17.116]  But the neoliberal global elite is absolutely petrified at the prospect of a Trump presidency.
[03:04:17.296 --> 03:04:18.517]  No, no, I agree.
[03:04:18.537 --> 03:04:19.637]  They're scared to death of him.
[03:04:19.657 --> 03:04:20.518]  They're trying to stop him.
[03:04:20.798 --> 03:04:23.039]  But we got to keep him honest as well and influence him.
[03:04:23.299 --> 03:04:27.461]  Like when he came out for refugees, because he didn't know they were a bunch of terrorists, and he came out against.
[03:04:27.501 --> 03:04:30.302]  I like the fact that he said when he got more info, he changed his view.
[03:04:30.682 --> 03:04:35.164]  It's OK to change your view when you get more info, if you don't just flip-flop because of political money.
[03:04:35.204 --> 03:04:35.825]  That's the difference.
[03:04:36.625 --> 03:04:40.507]  Doing what the people want and what's constitutional, that's where I want to see you change.
[03:04:42.798 --> 03:04:48.259]  And the reason they're petrified is that they don't want to be exposed further, as you've done such a great example, and you and others.
[03:04:48.719 --> 03:04:49.939]  Now, all of you have done it, brother.
[03:04:49.999 --> 03:04:50.579]  Thank you, Mark.
[03:04:51.020 --> 03:04:53.100]  I'll be back this Sunday, by the way, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:53.180 --> 03:04:55.200]  Central, with the Sunday Transmission.
[03:04:55.240 --> 03:04:56.200]  I'll be in studio live.
[03:04:56.220 --> 03:04:58.241]  A lot of big special reports coming up as well.
[03:04:58.281 --> 03:05:01.181]  I'm going to come in and hand the baton to David and I straight ahead.
[03:05:01.201 --> 03:05:02.882]  I'll be talking to Brian, Anthony, Vince, and others.
[03:05:03.182 --> 03:05:06.862]  And we're going to announce the winner of the Snakes on a Plane meme.
[03:05:07.322 --> 03:05:08.683]  I kind of like the Snakes on a Plane one.
[03:05:08.703 --> 03:05:09.703]  That might be the winner, or maybe.
[03:05:09.743 --> 03:05:10.403]  I haven't decided yet.
[03:05:10.923 --> 03:05:11.444]  Extra!
[03:05:11.604 --> 03:05:12.124]  Extra!
[03:05:12.224 --> 03:05:13.065]  Read all about it!
[03:05:13.305 --> 03:05:19.409]  The New York Daily News has published the complete guide to fleeing Donald Trump's America.
[03:05:19.629 --> 03:05:23.891]  This is the liberal response to a potential Donald Trump presidency.
[03:05:24.011 --> 03:05:28.034]  And they are claiming that left-leaning Americans all across the nation
[03:05:28.274 --> 03:05:33.040]  Plan on packing it up and leaving the country should Donald Trump become president.
[03:05:33.201 --> 03:05:38.147]  The guide comes complete with a list of the cheapest and friendliest countries to run to.
[03:05:38.508 --> 03:05:44.396]  It also shows you how to get a work visa and how to make new friends in your new environment.
[03:05:44.696 --> 03:05:50.299]  And there's even a list of celebrities who say they will leave the country if Trump wins the election.
[03:05:50.419 --> 03:05:57.203]  People like Rosie O'Donnell, Whoopi Goldberg, Jonathan Stewart, Samuel L. Jackson, and the Reverend Al Sharpton.
[03:05:57.323 --> 03:06:02.546]  Well, they say they are leaving the country if Donald Trump becomes President of the United States.
[03:06:02.606 --> 03:06:03.366]  One more reason I want to elect him.
[03:06:03.386 --> 03:06:06.008]  We need to get behind this, and we need to support it.
[03:06:06.328 --> 03:06:08.709]  And you can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[03:06:10.470 --> 03:06:14.154]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out.
[03:06:14.214 --> 03:06:14.755]  Tell us what happened.
[03:06:15.115 --> 03:06:19.740]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[03:06:19.881 --> 03:06:20.922]  Talk about the effects.
[03:06:21.222 --> 03:06:22.704]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[03:06:22.724 --> 03:06:24.346]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[03:06:24.666 --> 03:06:25.707]  I feel like I look better.
[03:06:25.767 --> 03:06:26.428]  I feel better.
[03:06:26.488 --> 03:06:27.569]  I feel sexier.
[03:06:27.889 --> 03:06:28.250]  I love it.
[03:06:28.490 --> 03:06:31.391]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[03:06:31.471 --> 03:06:34.192]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[03:06:34.413 --> 03:06:35.433]  Check it out for yourself.
[03:06:35.493 --> 03:06:36.533]  Consult your physician.
[03:06:36.674 --> 03:06:38.874]  Visit Infowarslife.com today.
[03:06:39.035 --> 03:06:39.995]  This is life-changing.
[03:06:40.375 --> 03:06:41.135]  Shower filters.
[03:06:41.276 --> 03:06:42.916]  We're introducing the best yet.
[03:06:43.016 --> 03:06:46.958]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.
[03:06:47.078 --> 03:06:51.660]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[03:06:51.880 --> 03:06:58.826]  This new four-stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[03:06:58.966 --> 03:07:09.795]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter and free shipping at InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139 to order your ProMax shower filter from ProPure today.
[03:07:10.135 --> 03:07:12.096]  Rainforest, it's completely different.
[03:07:12.176 --> 03:07:13.217]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:07:13.397 --> 03:07:14.819]  Rob Du joins us.
[03:07:14.999 --> 03:07:17.781]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours
[03:07:18.101 --> 03:07:19.142]  Tell us what Brain Force did.
[03:07:19.182 --> 03:07:20.103]  I've been working all day.
[03:07:20.123 --> 03:07:22.486]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:07:22.626 --> 03:07:23.627]  I get in here at 830.
[03:07:24.047 --> 03:07:25.689]  I was kind of run down.
[03:07:25.969 --> 03:07:27.751]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[03:07:27.911 --> 03:07:29.753]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:07:29.773 --> 03:07:31.575]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[03:07:31.615 --> 03:07:32.375]  I popped two of them.
[03:07:32.676 --> 03:07:36.800]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like everything just kind of clears up.
[03:07:36.940 --> 03:07:38.180]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:07:38.380 --> 03:07:39.400]  People really love it.
[03:07:39.700 --> 03:07:40.241]  Read about it.
[03:07:40.321 --> 03:07:49.462]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:07:49.622 --> 03:07:53.663]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:07:53.683 --> 03:07:59.444]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:07:59.804 --> 03:08:04.705]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:08:05.265 --> 03:08:06.106]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[03:08:06.426 --> 03:08:14.030]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[03:08:14.510 --> 03:08:19.633]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[03:08:20.594 --> 03:08:26.617]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[03:08:26.657 --> 03:08:29.699]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:08:29.739 --> 03:08:32.801]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that in.
[03:08:36.976 --> 03:08:37.936]  Amarillo by morning.
[03:08:39.277 --> 03:08:43.098]  I know what's gonna be on my playlist tonight.
[03:08:44.419 --> 03:08:45.660]  A lot of George Strait.
[03:08:45.680 --> 03:08:47.120]  A lot of Merle Haggard.
[03:08:47.981 --> 03:08:49.121]  A lot of Willie Nelson.
[03:08:50.682 --> 03:08:51.783]  A lot of Waylon Jennings.
[03:08:53.163 --> 03:08:54.384]  A lot of Johnny Paycheck.
[03:08:56.705 --> 03:09:02.167]  A lot of Dwight Yoakam.
[03:09:02.268 --> 03:09:02.948]  And then even more.
[03:09:04.558 --> 03:09:05.379]  George Strait.
[03:09:06.119 --> 03:09:07.760]  Because I need to relax.
[03:09:08.920 --> 03:09:11.662]  I think I'm gonna go play board games with my kids tonight.
[03:09:12.382 --> 03:09:14.443]  Maybe grill outside and just act stupid.
[03:09:15.724 --> 03:09:17.044]  I ain't got a dime!
[03:09:18.245 --> 03:09:19.606]  But what I got is mine.
[03:09:20.106 --> 03:09:25.508]  You know, I'm not... I'm not rich, but I'm not poor.
[03:09:25.528 --> 03:09:30.251]  Because I gotta be able to fund this operation and at least have some money held back to deal with enemies and attacks.
[03:09:31.377 --> 03:09:32.878]  But the money I have means nothing.
[03:09:32.938 --> 03:09:37.701]  After you got a car that doesn't break down on you all the time and you got money for medicine and food for your kids and clothes.
[03:09:39.182 --> 03:09:40.263]  Money's not my God.
[03:09:40.323 --> 03:09:41.444]  Status isn't my God.
[03:09:41.484 --> 03:09:45.386]  In fact, it's annoying and, you know, owning a house, stuff breaks, having to deal with stuff.
[03:09:45.406 --> 03:09:48.588]  You learn what Christ said, lay down your possessions and follow me.
[03:09:49.429 --> 03:09:54.392]  But the modern world, we're so enslaved to technocracy and machines and computers.
[03:09:54.412 --> 03:09:55.373]  They have their dark side.
[03:09:56.173 --> 03:09:58.715]  I spend all my time just jacking with property.
[03:09:59.363 --> 03:10:01.484]  This is all property here to run this operation.
[03:10:02.204 --> 03:10:05.246]  Gotta pay taxes on it, gotta get inspected, gotta get harassed.
[03:10:06.506 --> 03:10:13.130]  Nothing sounds better than a little three-room log cabin out in the middle of the woods somewhere by Babylon River.
[03:10:14.730 --> 03:10:19.092]  And, you know, four or five changes of clothes and a simple life.
[03:10:20.533 --> 03:10:28.237]  But so many people never become a celebrity or successful or, you know, become a household name and so they think it's like some unknown country.
[03:10:28.888 --> 03:10:31.891]  That if you could get there, you would be fulfilled.
[03:10:33.612 --> 03:10:36.475]  The truth is I was never a very narcissistic or worldly person.
[03:10:37.035 --> 03:10:38.376]  I'm a very aggressive and confident.
[03:10:38.396 --> 03:10:40.018]  That comes off as arrogant and narcissistic.
[03:10:40.058 --> 03:10:40.418]  It's not.
[03:10:40.638 --> 03:10:41.119]  I'm committed.
[03:10:44.081 --> 03:10:47.504]  But I just wish people knew how much Hollywood didn't matter.
[03:10:48.365 --> 03:10:50.107]  How much the power structure doesn't matter.
[03:10:53.049 --> 03:10:58.770]  Like, I almost don't even want to go out to Hollywood and meet with Chris Carter, even though I like him and he says he's a listener and likes me and says nice things.
[03:10:59.070 --> 03:11:00.571]  I want to find out about the CIA and him.
[03:11:00.631 --> 03:11:01.371]  That's why I'm excited.
[03:11:01.791 --> 03:11:03.931]  Not, oh, hey, maybe I'll do a cameo on your show.
[03:11:04.251 --> 03:11:04.671]  Don't care.
[03:11:04.691 --> 03:11:07.572]  And I'm not bragging about this.
[03:11:07.632 --> 03:11:14.233]  I'm saying people literally freak out and fall down on their faces around movie stars.
[03:11:16.354 --> 03:11:17.394]  But it's all hollow.
[03:11:21.400 --> 03:11:23.722]  And I've noticed I'm talking to a lot of Hollywood stars and people.
[03:11:24.743 --> 03:11:29.688]  Incredibly beautiful women want to have sex with them, but they don't even want anything from them or to marry them.
[03:11:29.908 --> 03:11:34.453]  They want them run to the next star as if they're collecting worth from it.
[03:11:35.455 --> 03:11:38.076]  They don't even know how they could get something out of it.
[03:11:38.156 --> 03:11:42.678]  It's like, it's so empty, it's so stupid, it's so mindless.
[03:11:42.738 --> 03:11:48.581]  It's like all these women show up, I use them as the example, off buses and airplanes every day, beautiful beauty queens.
[03:11:49.461 --> 03:11:51.422]  But once they get to LA, there's all these beauty queens.
[03:11:55.523 --> 03:12:03.667]  And they want to be fulfilled.
[03:12:04.727 --> 03:12:06.528]  And even if they get in Hollywood, movies are not fulfilled.
[03:12:06.548 --> 03:12:07.549]  That's like one out of a thousand.
[03:12:07.889 --> 03:12:10.570]  The others all get into porn, and they're not fulfilled.
[03:12:11.591 --> 03:12:17.514]  But they just keep searching the New World Order, the system, the bottomless pit, thinking somewhere down there is the answer.
[03:12:18.235 --> 03:12:20.696]  When the answer was in their heart and their soul and their mind the whole time.
[03:12:22.537 --> 03:12:24.398]  Nico just ran in with a Wall Street Journal article.
[03:12:24.438 --> 03:12:26.540]  Trump reverses his stance on torture.
[03:12:26.580 --> 03:12:29.902]  GOP frontrunner had faced criticism from military and legit experts.
[03:12:30.282 --> 03:12:31.062]  Diverse comments.
[03:12:31.082 --> 03:12:32.203]  See, that makes me like him more.
[03:12:34.380 --> 03:12:37.203]  Because that's not flip-flopping, that's him getting informed.
[03:12:37.563 --> 03:12:42.968]  And what's crazy is stuff I relay to him, and the media matters picks up on this and stuff, but it's just true.
[03:12:43.408 --> 03:12:47.972]  I know for a fact, in person and off-air, a lot of stuff's been relayed to Trump from me.
[03:12:49.614 --> 03:12:56.240]  And I know for a fact certain little birdies told him yesterday and today, stop promoting torture, you don't understand, it doesn't get good answers.
[03:12:56.520 --> 03:12:59.162]  He goes, yeah, but they're gonna bomb a building and we can find the bombs.
[03:12:59.262 --> 03:13:00.764]  People sold him on that, he goes, oh, I get it.
[03:13:02.250 --> 03:13:06.072]  Trump is really somebody who you can actually inform and who means well.
[03:13:06.712 --> 03:13:10.113]  And that's why they're so scared of him is they know they've got his phones tapped.
[03:13:10.153 --> 03:13:10.874]  They know who he is.
[03:13:11.274 --> 03:13:15.656]  They know he's a big, crazy teddy bear who loves women and loves success.
[03:13:15.756 --> 03:13:16.536]  And he's not evil.
[03:13:17.176 --> 03:13:18.097]  Donald Trump's not evil.
[03:13:19.517 --> 03:13:23.819]  And so they're scared of him because they think he's got a heart just like Ronald Reagan.
[03:13:25.475 --> 03:13:27.356]  GOP frontrunner has faced criticism.
[03:13:28.116 --> 03:13:31.357]  Leading GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump said today he wouldn't order the U.S.
[03:13:31.377 --> 03:13:40.220]  military to break international laws, addressing criticism from military and legal experts that his policies regarding torture and killing the family members of terrorists would violate the Geneva Convention.
[03:13:40.861 --> 03:13:44.822]  See, that's why Ventura went from a week ago saying he wouldn't run against Trump to saying, I'm ready to.
[03:13:45.703 --> 03:13:47.543]  You can say, oh, Ventura won't win.
[03:13:47.923 --> 03:13:51.105]  He'll get enough votes in a third party to deep-six Trump.
[03:13:51.645 --> 03:13:54.426]  So Trump needs to be cozying up to Ventura right now.
[03:13:55.504 --> 03:13:58.127]  I know all the inside baseball on that, but you shouldn't get into it on air.
[03:13:59.709 --> 03:14:05.295]  Mr. Trump, in a statement to the Wall Street Journal, said he would use every legal power that I have to stop these terrorist enemies.
[03:14:05.315 --> 03:14:11.563]  I do, however, understand that the United States is bound by laws and treaties and I will not order our military or other officials to violate those laws.
[03:14:12.642 --> 03:14:13.162]  And he goes on.
[03:14:13.583 --> 03:14:21.727]  So, boom, I just went from like, you know, I was like 98% for Trump to like 90% over this, and then the CFR thing, I was like 85, and I'm being honest about that.
[03:14:22.368 --> 03:14:33.334]  Just like Knight was against him for the bookie and for him on the vaccines and everything else and being against NAFTA and TPP and globalism and these bad trade deals, you know, Knight was going for him.
[03:14:33.674 --> 03:14:35.535]  Then Knight, you know, starts going, I don't know.
[03:14:35.555 --> 03:14:37.816]  I mean, we're just going to be completely transparent here.
[03:14:38.157 --> 03:14:40.118]  We're not in some cult of Trump, folks.
[03:14:41.343 --> 03:14:43.044]  The whole power structure's against him.
[03:14:43.484 --> 03:14:44.505]  These aren't flip-flops.
[03:14:44.545 --> 03:14:45.686]  This is him being smart.
[03:14:47.527 --> 03:14:50.549]  A flip-flop's when you get one group pays you to say something and then you change it.
[03:14:50.830 --> 03:14:53.992]  Or you say, I'm not going to come after your guns and you do.
[03:14:54.032 --> 03:14:57.734]  Or you say Obamacare is free when you know the thing increases prices.
[03:14:58.034 --> 03:14:58.895]  That's lying.
[03:14:59.175 --> 03:14:59.916]  That's scamming.
[03:15:01.457 --> 03:15:02.878]  He says he will abolish it.
[03:15:02.918 --> 03:15:03.718]  He's put his plan out.
[03:15:03.778 --> 03:15:04.339]  It's a great plan.
[03:15:05.368 --> 03:15:06.129]  So Trump goes on.
[03:15:06.169 --> 03:15:06.909]  So good job.
[03:15:06.929 --> 03:15:07.750]  Bravo to Trump.
[03:15:07.790 --> 03:15:08.570]  That is super news.
[03:15:08.590 --> 03:15:11.152]  We'll go to David Knight in a moment and your phone calls and a lot more.
[03:15:11.172 --> 03:15:14.835]  And boy, he's got a full slate, so get ready.
[03:15:16.476 --> 03:15:18.778]  But that is a very, very, very, very, very positive point.
[03:15:18.798 --> 03:15:22.380]  The reason I talk about myself here on air is that's my gauge for how I see the world.
[03:15:23.601 --> 03:15:27.224]  And I just want people to know where I stand on all of this.
[03:15:30.191 --> 03:15:39.537]  I don't see the CFR reaching out to him and Gingrich reaching out to him and saying nice things as, oh my gosh, he's sold out.
[03:15:39.637 --> 03:15:43.399]  That's the power structure trying good cop when bad cop's not working.
[03:15:44.940 --> 03:15:48.242]  And so that's my view on that and it shows what a serious threat he is.
[03:15:49.863 --> 03:15:52.785]  They know stealing the election in front of everybody at the primary?
[03:15:53.809 --> 03:15:56.412]  is going to blow up and they know doing it at the convention is going to do it.
[03:15:56.832 --> 03:15:59.095]  That's why I've never been more excited.
[03:15:59.155 --> 03:16:00.617]  I've never been on more on edge.
[03:16:01.377 --> 03:16:02.699]  I hear people saying they're bored.
[03:16:05.242 --> 03:16:07.444]  North Korea took the nuclear triggers off two days ago.
[03:16:07.484 --> 03:16:09.046]  They just shot a missile over Japan.
[03:16:09.086 --> 03:16:09.887]  They're threatened to attack.
[03:16:09.927 --> 03:16:11.028]  They're run by a psychopath.
[03:16:11.769 --> 03:16:12.710]  Hereditary dictator.
[03:16:14.252 --> 03:16:15.873]  Russia is moving missiles around.
[03:16:15.953 --> 03:16:17.374]  I mean, all hell is breaking loose.
[03:16:17.755 --> 03:16:19.716]  Saudi Arabia is threatening to attack Russia.
[03:16:19.816 --> 03:16:22.438]  I mean, this is an incredible time to be alive.
[03:16:22.538 --> 03:16:23.519]  And they go, oh, don't fear monger.
[03:16:23.539 --> 03:16:24.380]  I'm not fear mongering.
[03:16:25.180 --> 03:16:29.964]  I'm saying we don't need John Kasich with his little friendly man speeches saying, let's attack Russia.
[03:16:30.384 --> 03:16:32.206]  No, Kasich, let's not do that!
[03:16:35.848 --> 03:16:39.311]  I don't get what it is about wimps wanting to start wars all the time.
[03:16:43.027 --> 03:16:46.090]  I haven't been in any wars, but I've broke some jaws.
[03:16:49.513 --> 03:16:53.276]  And I've defended myself to people who've had tubes up their noses and can't talk ever again very good.
[03:16:54.017 --> 03:16:57.279]  And I'll just tell you, I'm not proud of that even though I defended my life.
[03:16:59.181 --> 03:17:02.164]  Has Kasich ever grabbed somebody's head and bounced it in the concrete three times?
[03:17:05.406 --> 03:17:07.448]  Think John Kasich ever punched somebody and broke their jaw?
[03:17:07.648 --> 03:17:09.470]  Or punched somebody's nose right off their face?
[03:17:09.990 --> 03:17:10.131]  No.
[03:17:11.417 --> 03:17:16.238]  And he sure hadn't run into houses where people are shooting at you like somebody I know in Delta Force.
[03:17:17.979 --> 03:17:22.440]  And you get shot at, and you throw a hand grenade in, and you go in, and there's 15 children blown all over the walls.
[03:17:22.840 --> 03:17:25.920]  That's why guys like that don't want to start wars for nothing, because they've been there.
[03:17:26.600 --> 03:17:29.381]  And I'm sick of wimps trying to start wars constantly.
[03:17:29.721 --> 03:17:31.722]  I'm going to hand the baton to David Knight, but I'm going to say this.
[03:17:34.275 --> 03:17:34.695]  Upset.
[03:17:35.495 --> 03:17:37.236]  Last hour cover and all this, I never even plugged.
[03:17:37.516 --> 03:17:42.957]  We won't exist or have reporters to go to Davos, to go to the RNC, the DNC, all this, and I'm not bitching.
[03:17:43.157 --> 03:17:44.557]  We've built all this thanks to your support.
[03:17:44.737 --> 03:17:47.218]  But we got incredible water filters, the very best, the best price.
[03:17:47.418 --> 03:17:56.460]  We got game-changing nutraceuticals, like Liver Shield and X2, and Supramel Vitality and AnthroPlex is back in, and the best squirrel foods at the lowest prices.
[03:17:56.500 --> 03:17:57.480]  We go out and we find them.
[03:17:58.700 --> 03:18:00.501]  So you need the items we've got.
[03:18:01.778 --> 03:18:03.800]  And we need the funds to operate this place.
[03:18:03.820 --> 03:18:05.322]  We got 50% on colloidal silver.
[03:18:05.362 --> 03:18:07.544]  That ends at the end of the weekend or when supplies run out.
[03:18:07.584 --> 03:18:08.164]  It may be earlier.
[03:18:08.184 --> 03:18:19.696]  The brain force is the best noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot-noot
[03:18:24.417 --> 03:18:25.778]  And I think my crew's awesome, too.
[03:18:25.938 --> 03:18:28.580]  I want to give some people around here little raises and bonuses.
[03:18:28.880 --> 03:18:29.881]  I need the money to do that.
[03:18:30.281 --> 03:18:32.142]  So if you believe in what we're doing, we believe in you.
[03:18:32.383 --> 03:18:33.343]  We're all in the fight.
[03:18:33.383 --> 03:18:34.804]  Supply us in the InfoWars.

[03:18:37.766 --> 03:18:39.007]  We're skipping this network break, though.
[03:18:39.467 --> 03:18:40.168]  I did a fourth hour.
[03:18:40.188 --> 03:18:40.728]  It doesn't even matter.
[03:18:40.768 --> 03:18:44.011]  I did a fourth hour so I can take a few breaks out of the day because they get more breaks anyways.
[03:18:44.351 --> 03:18:45.672]  That's how my weird brain works.
[03:18:46.132 --> 03:18:48.754]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:18:49.054 --> 03:18:49.955]  Those are the coordinates.
[03:18:50.335 --> 03:18:52.977]  If you haven't bought X2, you're nuts.
[03:18:53.337 --> 03:18:54.378]  It's pure iodine.
[03:18:54.398 --> 03:18:55.779]  The other stuff doesn't get absorbed.
[03:18:56.099 --> 03:18:57.240]  You will detoxify.
[03:18:57.260 --> 03:19:00.202]  You may feel like crap two weeks in, but after that, get ready.
[03:19:00.382 --> 03:19:01.443]  Go read the rave reviews.
[03:19:01.783 --> 03:19:02.363]  Five star.
[03:19:02.844 --> 03:19:04.224]  Go read Liver Shield.
[03:19:04.465 --> 03:19:05.245]  Let's see what it does.
[03:19:05.385 --> 03:19:06.626]  Go get the Oxy Powder.
[03:19:06.906 --> 03:19:09.428]  Go get the, well, DNA Force, a bunch of stuff sold out.
[03:19:09.708 --> 03:19:10.929]  Get the Survival Shield.
[03:19:11.189 --> 03:19:12.070]  Get the Silver Bullet.

[03:19:14.531 --> 03:19:15.692]  I gotta tell you right now, David Knight,
[03:19:20.146 --> 03:19:21.428]  It is very exciting.
[03:19:21.448 --> 03:19:24.431]  I'm going to get out here in a few minutes because you've got a full slate to see what's happening.
[03:19:24.451 --> 03:19:26.673]  It's also scary to see the persecution of Patriot groups.
[03:19:27.234 --> 03:19:32.320]  They could just start arresting people forever saying, you know, that they supported the Bundys and support private property.
[03:19:32.560 --> 03:19:33.401]  You got that going on.
[03:19:33.421 --> 03:19:37.585]  But first, Trump, what do you make of that circus, that bloodbath?
[03:19:38.266 --> 03:19:47.957]  It was like Gladiator, the movie, where they just keep putting everybody up against him, ganging up on him, you know, with five lions and, you know, tigers and everything else, and the top gladiator can't beat him.
[03:19:48.437 --> 03:19:50.760]  Megyn Kelly was like channeling a satanic spirit.
[03:19:50.780 --> 03:19:56.726]  She was beautiful, but looked like the essential evil, beautiful witch, like she wanted to murder Trump.
[03:19:58.499 --> 03:20:03.705]  Just the power trip of these people, the demonization, and now Trump coming out against torture.
[03:20:03.965 --> 03:20:12.836]  Because, to be clear, if somebody's wife, like in San Bernardino, is aiding and abetting, is connected, say we're going to arrest you, we're going to prosecute you, we're going to lock you in prison.
[03:20:13.757 --> 03:20:16.040]  That's incentive enough to say we're going to kill your wife.
[03:20:16.160 --> 03:20:17.362]  Okay, I get Trump's statement.
[03:20:18.536 --> 03:20:19.997]  Okay, but you don't codify it.
[03:20:20.057 --> 03:20:21.138]  You don't put it into law.
[03:20:21.538 --> 03:20:23.080]  You don't engage in things like that.
[03:20:23.100 --> 03:20:24.541]  And let's just not lie.
[03:20:24.641 --> 03:20:25.742]  Torture is part of war.
[03:20:26.102 --> 03:20:26.622]  It happens.
[03:20:26.783 --> 03:20:27.683]  You don't condone it.
[03:20:27.743 --> 03:20:28.484]  You don't push it.
[03:20:28.804 --> 03:20:29.785]  It happens here and there.
[03:20:29.805 --> 03:20:33.308]  You sure don't light it up in Christmas tree lights like it's a great thing.
[03:20:33.708 --> 03:20:34.289]  David Knight.
[03:20:35.279 --> 03:20:37.762]  I mean, this is just such a battle between good and evil right now.
[03:20:37.862 --> 03:20:41.365]  I've never seen such an amazing time to be alive.
[03:20:41.405 --> 03:20:42.867]  I just can't, it's just, it's incredible!
[03:20:43.568 --> 03:20:44.228]  It's incredible!
[03:20:44.589 --> 03:20:53.078]  Alex, you know, this deeply disturbed me to hear Donald Trump talking about bringing back the enhanced interrogation, as the Bush administration called it.
[03:20:53.718 --> 03:21:01.366]  And it's incredibly disingenuous for people like Michael Hayden, who was Bush's CIA director when this stuff was going on.
[03:21:01.386 --> 03:21:02.287]  He was running the whole thing!
[03:21:02.667 --> 03:21:07.832]  Yeah, to come back and say, hey, you know, this is a violation of international law and try to take the moral high ground.
[03:21:08.053 --> 03:21:10.175]  It was a trap by the neocons.
[03:21:10.515 --> 03:21:11.056]  We're good to go.
[03:21:29.531 --> 03:21:33.933]  It puts us on the side of evil and you don't torture suspects.
[03:21:33.993 --> 03:21:34.373]  That's the key.
[03:21:34.413 --> 03:21:38.235]  They want us to do it so they can get rid of all of our due process and do it to the Patriots.
[03:21:38.475 --> 03:21:41.696]  They would love to be waterboarding the Bundys right now.
[03:21:41.756 --> 03:21:42.196]  Guaranteed.
[03:21:42.437 --> 03:21:42.977]  Oh absolutely.
[03:21:43.217 --> 03:21:47.559]  And we look at somebody like Michael Hayden and they say well he's a GOP hawk and he's putting this out there.
[03:21:47.579 --> 03:21:52.241]  Let's understand Michael Hayden was appointed to the head of the NSA by Bill Clinton.
[03:21:52.661 --> 03:21:53.521]  And let's go further.
[03:21:53.641 --> 03:21:54.141]  Let's go further.
[03:21:54.161 --> 03:21:55.062]  That little pansy
[03:21:55.862 --> 03:22:04.952]  He was a quarterback of torture and illegal spying, so for him to think the public's dumb and flip and then act like Trump's bad, I actually liked Trump being honest about torture.
[03:22:05.112 --> 03:22:05.733]  Yes, yes.
[03:22:05.813 --> 03:22:07.055]  I mean, that's why he's better than them.
[03:22:07.095 --> 03:22:08.676]  He doesn't sneak around and do it, see?
[03:22:08.696 --> 03:22:10.078]  Because he thinks it's okay.
[03:22:10.398 --> 03:22:10.739]  Exactly.
[03:22:10.779 --> 03:22:16.105]  You've got the people who actually did it now claiming that they have the moral high grounds, like, whoa, we would refuse orders.
[03:22:16.405 --> 03:22:26.436]  I'm going to talk about what's going on with these people and what's going on in the wake of all the people being arrested across the country, as well as the special agent who was in charge there, Dan Love.
[03:22:26.656 --> 03:22:37.627]  I've got multiple articles from across Utah and Nevada, sheriffs who are complaining about him, county commissioners who are complaining about Dan Love, the guy who ran this, and I have to say,
[03:22:38.702 --> 03:22:42.845]  At what point are citizens allowed to stand up and disobey illegal orders?
[03:22:42.865 --> 03:22:48.830]  Well, David, they were pointing guns at you there in a ravine on the side of the highway saying don't walk forward.
[03:22:48.890 --> 03:22:50.571]  As press, you walk forward.
[03:22:50.611 --> 03:22:51.592]  Fox News did too.
[03:22:52.093 --> 03:22:55.195]  I wonder if they're going to arrest you but leave Fox News alone because you dare damn a camera at them.
[03:22:55.215 --> 03:22:56.396]  They've arrested David Bundy for that.
[03:22:56.696 --> 03:22:57.577]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:22:57.597 --> 03:22:58.658]  That's what they did with David Bundy.
[03:22:58.918 --> 03:23:01.520]  Look, they put up a First Amendment area.
[03:23:01.580 --> 03:23:04.462]  That's something that even the governor of Nevada complained about.
[03:23:04.482 --> 03:23:05.243]  They will arrest him?
[03:23:05.563 --> 03:23:06.664]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:23:06.944 --> 03:23:08.846]  The First Amendment is not an area.
[03:23:09.666 --> 03:23:10.907]  You don't get a free pass.
[03:23:10.947 --> 03:23:14.410]  And that's been adjudicated hundreds of times, and that's why the feds are going to get greedy.
[03:23:14.710 --> 03:23:16.652]  They won their battle out in Oregon.
[03:23:16.992 --> 03:23:19.254]  Now these leftists that run it are licking their chops.
[03:23:19.274 --> 03:23:21.075]  They want to start some jihad against us.
[03:23:21.436 --> 03:23:21.896]  It's sick.
[03:23:21.916 --> 03:23:22.617]  Speaking of Hayden,
[03:23:23.337 --> 03:23:24.718]  The little grimy creature.
[03:23:25.799 --> 03:23:30.163]  Let's go ahead and go to this guy, you know, talking about he has the moral high ground against torture.
[03:23:30.743 --> 03:23:32.324]  No, he ordered people to do it.
[03:23:32.524 --> 03:23:34.486]  And when they got caught, he sent them to prison.
[03:23:34.806 --> 03:23:36.367]  He's 10 times worse than Trump.
[03:23:36.427 --> 03:23:36.828]  Go ahead.
[03:23:37.088 --> 03:23:37.288]  Yeah.
[03:23:37.348 --> 03:23:37.949]  Oh, exactly.
[03:23:38.269 --> 03:23:38.649]  Absolutely.
[03:23:38.669 --> 03:23:45.334]  What do you think about a President Trump and or any of these Republicans and some of the stuff they say that strikes me as crazy?
[03:23:46.295 --> 03:23:58.419]  I would be incredibly concerned if a President Trump governed in a way that was consistent with the language that candidate Trump expressed during the campaign.
[03:24:03.109 --> 03:24:06.532]  If I was casting for a perv, I'd sweat hard, Hollywood.
[03:24:06.632 --> 03:24:10.236]  We're gonna do waterboarding and a whole lot more because they deserve it.
[03:24:10.776 --> 03:24:14.180]  Look, we did... What about killing the terrorist's family?
[03:24:14.200 --> 03:24:14.700]  Families!
[03:24:14.900 --> 03:24:15.281]  Oh my God.
[03:24:15.321 --> 03:24:16.182]  Let me give you a punchline.
[03:24:16.202 --> 03:24:17.943]  I mean, that never even occurred to you, right?
[03:24:18.023 --> 03:24:19.024]  I mean, you... Not God, no.
[03:24:19.345 --> 03:24:19.665]  Yeah.
[03:24:19.745 --> 03:24:20.206]  Oh, that's bull.
[03:24:20.226 --> 03:24:21.066]  They tortured families.
[03:24:22.107 --> 03:24:22.787]  You're a liar.
[03:24:22.827 --> 03:24:24.148]  You're a real badass.
[03:24:24.548 --> 03:24:26.749]  You never fought anybody.
[03:24:26.929 --> 03:24:32.731]  If he were to order that, once in government, the American Armed Forces would refuse to act.
[03:24:33.011 --> 03:24:33.211]  What?
[03:24:34.772 --> 03:24:36.033]  No, they followed your orders.
[03:24:36.433 --> 03:24:40.494]  I thought the whole thing was... And when they got caught, you let them go to prison.
[03:24:40.514 --> 03:24:41.195]  You cannot.
[03:24:41.575 --> 03:24:42.455]  You're not committed.
[03:24:42.475 --> 03:24:43.175]  You're not required.
[03:24:43.195 --> 03:24:43.836]  In fact, you were required.
[03:24:43.896 --> 03:24:46.877]  I just can't stand to see this guy from what I've heard him say.
[03:24:47.597 --> 03:24:49.478]  And now he's saying you don't follow illegal orders.
[03:24:49.879 --> 03:24:53.221]  Let me tell you, we have, he says you don't follow illegal orders.
[03:24:53.961 --> 03:24:57.784]  We had a speech that he gave at Washington and the University.
[03:24:57.804 --> 03:25:00.045]  Well he's saying that because they have torture warrants.
[03:25:00.406 --> 03:25:02.847]  He says you don't do it because they deserve it, you do it because you need to.
[03:25:03.307 --> 03:25:06.510]  Well let me tell you, going back, he was also, he was not only CIA, but he was NSA.
[03:25:07.410 --> 03:25:10.354]  And he was speaking at Washington Lee University to the legal people there.
[03:25:10.394 --> 03:25:12.176]  And we have, we've covered this in the past.
[03:25:12.216 --> 03:25:13.077]  We still have this clip.
[03:25:13.457 --> 03:25:19.083]  And he says to the students there, he said, oh, you know, we're talking about whatever it is, section 123 of the code to spy on people after 9-11.
[03:25:19.103 --> 03:25:19.524]  He goes,
[03:25:22.287 --> 03:25:23.767]  I didn't need 123.
[03:25:23.827 --> 03:25:26.628]  I didn't need any stinking law from the Congress.
[03:25:27.068 --> 03:25:29.329]  I had a direct order from the President.
[03:25:29.369 --> 03:25:31.369]  And he got, you know, in their face about that.
[03:25:31.409 --> 03:25:32.249]  It's like, oh really?
[03:25:32.509 --> 03:25:34.410]  You don't need the Constitution, Michael Hayden?
[03:25:34.790 --> 03:25:36.410]  You got a direct order from the President.
[03:25:36.450 --> 03:25:38.491]  I'm not against effeminate men, okay?
[03:25:38.951 --> 03:25:39.491]  That's fine.
[03:25:40.291 --> 03:25:43.452]  My issue is, why is it always these weird effeminate men
[03:25:44.462 --> 03:25:47.325]  So you would expect to see, you know, a gay cocktail bar.
[03:25:48.045 --> 03:25:51.869]  Why is it always them talking about tough guys and killing and murder and all this?
[03:25:52.449 --> 03:25:53.970]  Yeah, well, here's the thing.
[03:25:54.191 --> 03:26:06.762]  This guy represented himself as a libertarian on stage with Judge Napolitano, and the moderator as well as Judge Napolitano in the audience looked at him like, why do you... Yeah, like Judge Napolitano, I'm a libertarian too, and it's like...
[03:26:07.202 --> 03:26:07.903]  You're joking.
[03:26:08.523 --> 03:26:14.068]  This is a guy who says he doesn't care about the Constitution, he doesn't care about the laws that Congress passes because he's got a direct order from the President.
[03:26:14.088 --> 03:26:16.910]  Well, now he's a chameleon because he knows how popular libertarianism is, so that's the good news.
[03:26:17.190 --> 03:26:18.331]  What do you make of the stunning clip?
[03:26:18.351 --> 03:26:19.492]  Let's get it ready and we're going to go to break.
[03:26:19.532 --> 03:26:20.874]  I'm going to punch out and let you take over.
[03:26:21.674 --> 03:26:26.799]  Gingrich coming out and saying secret society is the elite, he's not part of it, channeling yours truly.
[03:26:27.119 --> 03:26:34.645]  This shows how the liberty movement has taken over that now Gingrich, a consummate globalist, he's high level, is now a chameleon role.
[03:26:34.685 --> 03:26:35.406]  Let's play that clip.
[03:26:37.132 --> 03:26:43.435]  And now they're faced with a very real prospect of Donald Trump becoming the leader of the party, and it absolutely drives them crazy.
[03:26:44.096 --> 03:26:45.997]  They just cannot imagine sharing... Why?
[03:26:46.017 --> 03:26:47.537]  Well, because he's an outsider.
[03:26:47.577 --> 03:26:48.178]  He's not them.
[03:26:48.218 --> 03:26:49.298]  He's not part of the club.
[03:26:49.738 --> 03:26:50.779]  He's uncontrollable.
[03:26:50.799 --> 03:26:53.800]  You know, he hasn't been through the initiation rites.
[03:26:53.840 --> 03:26:55.501]  He didn't belong to the secret society.
[03:26:56.762 --> 03:27:00.704]  And I think that they don't see him... They have no idea how to relate to him.
[03:27:01.547 --> 03:27:06.930]  I mean, I grew up in Dallas, Texas in the richest county, Rockwall, because I was good looking and from a good family.
[03:27:07.671 --> 03:27:10.233]  I had multiple rich groups, I mean, billionaire groups.
[03:27:10.553 --> 03:27:12.514]  I was in high school trying to recruit me into secret societies.
[03:27:12.794 --> 03:27:14.635]  So when Gingrich is saying that, folks, let me explain something.
[03:27:15.356 --> 03:27:19.979]  In most of these circles, there are all these, there's a panoptagon of secret societies
[03:27:20.239 --> 03:27:24.425]  That are feeder groups into the Illuminati, as you saw with the Scalia.
[03:27:25.066 --> 03:27:26.548]  And so what he's saying there is real.
[03:27:26.849 --> 03:27:28.391]  For me, David, I want to ask this question.
[03:27:28.711 --> 03:27:32.517]  How big is it that they're talking that clearly now about reality?
[03:27:32.597 --> 03:27:33.658]  What's really happening here?
[03:27:34.335 --> 03:27:41.998]  Well, Alex, just as we were talking about Michael Hayden calling himself a libertarian, I can remember 25 years ago when I was working in the Libertarian Party, nobody even knew what that word was.
[03:27:42.639 --> 03:27:47.040]  You'd talk to people, they would say a librarian party, whatever, we don't understand what that is.
[03:27:47.641 --> 03:27:49.381]  So, it's become part of the vernacular.
[03:27:50.002 --> 03:27:59.566]  And the idea, the understanding, I should say, not the idea, but the understanding that we have a secret globalist cabal, I've said the GOP needs to rename itself the globalist oligarch party because that's what they really are.
[03:28:00.106 --> 03:28:03.029]  That has become, people have woken up to that as well.
[03:28:03.049 --> 03:28:08.095]  And so when we see Gingrich talking about this, to me, I think he's inoculating himself by this.
[03:28:08.215 --> 03:28:09.797]  I think he's positioning himself.
[03:28:09.897 --> 03:28:12.400]  I don't think he's on our side anymore than I think Michael Hayden is.
[03:28:12.420 --> 03:28:13.782]  What about Gayle's pedophiles?
[03:28:15.123 --> 03:28:15.783]  That's a good one too.
[03:28:16.263 --> 03:28:24.105]  I don't think that this is genuine even more than I think that Hayden is genuine, but they both understand that people understand.
[03:28:24.145 --> 03:28:34.688]  People have woken up, they understand what the libertarian movement is about, they know what libertarians are now, they know about these secret societies, and so they try to inoculate themselves from it by talking about it.
[03:28:34.748 --> 03:28:35.548]  I'm concerned.
[03:28:35.969 --> 03:28:40.950]  I still believe that Senator Sessions has more sway with the Donald Trump camp.
[03:28:40.970 --> 03:28:42.330]  He's been working with them since August.
[03:28:42.350 --> 03:28:43.070]  Yeah, I want Sessions.
[03:28:43.110 --> 03:28:44.691]  We need to push for Sessions to be the VP.
[03:28:45.051 --> 03:28:46.991]  Yeah, but I'm concerned about the Richard Haass stuff.
[03:28:47.051 --> 03:28:48.692]  I did not like Stone earlier saying that.
[03:28:48.792 --> 03:28:59.594]  Yeah, I'm concerned about the Richard Haass stuff, and remember, it was Ronald Reagan who was the first president for a long, long time, I think since the CFR had been created, that wasn't a CFR member.
[03:28:59.634 --> 03:29:00.934]  People can check me on the facts of that.
[03:29:01.094 --> 03:29:08.836]  Nevertheless, Ronald Reagan was not a member, but when he got in, he appointed, what was it, 350, 360 people from the CFR throughout the State Department.
[03:29:09.276 --> 03:29:10.797]  So we have to be aware of that.
[03:29:10.817 --> 03:29:13.379]  We have to be speaking about that.
[03:29:13.439 --> 03:29:14.840]  Make that part of the... Absolutely, David.
[03:29:14.860 --> 03:29:16.200]  I'm going to throw the baton to you.
[03:29:16.621 --> 03:29:18.402]  Again, listeners and viewers, spread the word.
[03:29:18.422 --> 03:29:20.023]  I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:29:20.343 --> 03:29:21.664]  Not in the news tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:29:21.764 --> 03:29:24.045]  Great coverage last night of the debate by the crews.
[03:29:24.065 --> 03:29:25.326]  So bravo to David Jakari.
[03:29:25.886 --> 03:29:28.389]  And everybody else that made it all possible, the folks behind the scenes.
[03:29:28.629 --> 03:29:29.730]  We're working hard for you.
[03:29:30.011 --> 03:29:30.811]  We're in this together.
[03:29:30.932 --> 03:29:32.013]  Thank you for your support.

[03:29:48.229 --> 03:29:49.571]  David's going to be in.
[03:29:49.611 --> 03:29:51.072]  We're doing serious budget planning.
[03:29:51.092 --> 03:29:56.377]  Because so much of a war is decisions I have to make about major rollouts and some big plans.
[03:29:56.838 --> 03:30:00.101]  So help us know with a vote by purchasing products.
[03:30:00.201 --> 03:30:01.102]  We're on the march.
[03:30:01.583 --> 03:30:03.144]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.184 --> 03:30:04.165]  David Knight's three minutes out.
[03:30:04.185 --> 03:30:04.425]  Stay with it.
[03:30:04.445 --> 03:30:06.808]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.842 --> 03:30:11.722]  He's an outsider.
[03:30:11.762 --> 03:30:12.383]  He's not them.
[03:30:12.423 --> 03:30:13.483]  He's not part of the club.
[03:30:13.923 --> 03:30:15.744]  He's uncontrollable.
[03:30:15.764 --> 03:30:17.965]  He hasn't been through the initiation rites.
[03:30:18.005 --> 03:30:19.686]  He didn't belong to the secret society.
[03:30:19.786 --> 03:30:25.708]  That was former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, explaining why the Republican establishment is so scared of Donald Trump.
[03:30:26.009 --> 03:30:33.972]  Gingrich would know about secret societies, given his affiliation with Bohemian Grove, although he could also be speaking of the Skull and Bones Club,
[03:30:37.694 --> 03:30:46.139]  Trump has played the role of outsider and people are loving him for it but he has held private briefings with some secret society types like Richard Haass.
[03:30:46.279 --> 03:30:48.880]  Haass is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:30:49.060 --> 03:30:53.563]  He's also a member of the influential Trilateral Commission and a Bilderberg attendee.
[03:30:53.883 --> 03:31:01.149]  Earlier this week, a number of prominent neocons released an open letter stating their opposition to the candidacy of Donald Trump.
[03:31:01.450 --> 03:31:03.031]  Haas did not sign the letter.
[03:31:03.231 --> 03:31:06.054]  Could Richard Haas be one of Trump's potential cabinet picks?

[03:33:14.164 --> 03:33:17.165]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:33:17.745 --> 03:33:21.946]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:22.846 --> 03:33:30.128]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, March the 4th, 2016.
[03:33:30.228 --> 03:33:33.229]  I'm David Knight and joining me is Rob Dew.
[03:33:33.249 --> 03:33:35.590]  We're going to take a look at the meme contest.
[03:33:35.630 --> 03:33:37.430]  We're actually going to judge the meme contest.
[03:33:37.470 --> 03:33:40.851]  I'm also going to take Brian in Texas who's been holding for a while to talk about health care.
[03:33:40.871 --> 03:33:42.392]  I want to get to him as well.
[03:33:43.092 --> 03:33:49.334]  And I want to talk about what's going on with the arrest of all these people who are supporting the Bundys at the standoff.
[03:33:49.734 --> 03:33:56.796]  I was there covering it, and I've got to tell you, I'm very deeply disturbed by these criminal complaints that I saw.
[03:33:56.816 --> 03:34:00.917]  I haven't seen the indictment, but I'm assuming the indictment is the same as the criminal complaints.
[03:34:01.637 --> 03:34:03.898]  It does not match at all with what I saw there.
[03:34:04.278 --> 03:34:06.479]  I think this is an incredible case of government overreach.
[03:34:07.419 --> 03:34:08.260]  They're expanding this.
[03:34:08.300 --> 03:34:12.264]  They arrested another 12 people and we're going to cover that in just a moment.
[03:34:13.044 --> 03:34:19.951]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know that we've got a sale on Silver Bullet, 50% off at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:34:20.251 --> 03:34:25.476]  Again, that's Silver Bullet, our colloidal silver, 30 parts per million, a very high concentration.
[03:34:26.096 --> 03:34:26.637]  Of course!
[03:34:43.675 --> 03:34:46.276]  Government considers Bundy supporters to be domestic terrorists.
[03:34:46.316 --> 03:34:53.759]  He points out that two more of Clive and Bundy's sons, David and Mel, were arrested by federal agents yesterday.
[03:34:53.779 --> 03:34:56.900]  They already had two sons that were arrested up in Oregon.
[03:34:56.920 --> 03:34:58.260]  That was Ammon and Ryan.
[03:34:58.601 --> 03:35:02.482]  You know, quite frankly, when I was there, I never saw David or Melvin.
[03:35:02.902 --> 03:35:04.243]  Ammon was a spokesperson.
[03:35:04.563 --> 03:35:05.583]  He was talking to the press.
[03:35:06.143 --> 03:35:07.484]  Ryan was there as well.
[03:35:08.064 --> 03:35:10.725]  David had been arrested before we got there.
[03:35:11.405 --> 03:35:20.488]  He had been transported, which is a very long distance, over an hour down to Las Vegas because that entire area is Clark County from Las Vegas all the way up to Bunkerville.
[03:35:20.768 --> 03:35:24.770]  He'd been transported down there, arrested for taking pictures of these agents.
[03:35:24.850 --> 03:35:27.711]  You know, you're not allowed to take pictures of your masters.
[03:35:27.811 --> 03:35:30.612]  Don't look them in the eye because that's a threat.
[03:35:31.092 --> 03:35:31.272]  Okay.
[03:35:47.492 --> 03:35:48.572]  Are these BLM agents?
[03:35:48.692 --> 03:35:52.513]  Nevertheless, they transported him all the way to Las Vegas, then they just turned him out on the street.
[03:35:52.553 --> 03:35:54.654]  They didn't charge him with anything, but now they have arrested him.
[03:35:55.414 --> 03:36:01.495]  They're probably, if they get through with these and get these charges to stick in federal court, they will put them in jail for decades.
[03:36:01.935 --> 03:36:04.176]  They have arrested 12 people in six states.
[03:36:04.616 --> 03:36:06.337]  And this statement from the U.S.
[03:36:06.357 --> 03:36:16.059]  Attorney, Daniel Bogdan, said in a statement, this investigation began the day after the assault against federal law enforcement officers and continues to this day, he said.
[03:36:16.539 --> 03:36:24.743]  We will continue to work to identify the assaults and their role in the assault and the aftermath in order to ensure that justice is served.
[03:36:24.783 --> 03:36:26.884]  So this is something that they have ongoing.
[03:36:27.325 --> 03:36:31.707]  One of the people arrested, they're making a big deal out of this because he was a political activist up in New Hampshire.
[03:36:32.067 --> 03:36:33.328]  His name is Delimis.
[03:36:34.088 --> 03:36:41.572]  He was one of the four co-chairs of an auxiliary group that was supporting Donald Trump, Veterans for Trump in New Hampshire.
[03:36:42.172 --> 03:36:50.015]  It's not a formal part of the Trump campaign, but you have corporate media, as Kurt Nemo points out, is making a big deal out of that connection.
[03:36:50.055 --> 03:36:53.077]  Now, his wife is also a New Hampshire state representative.
[03:36:53.517 --> 03:36:58.319]  As he came out of the court as part of this indictment, supporters were there in New Hampshire.
[03:36:58.779 --> 03:37:07.103]  They were, and this was reported by the New Hampshire union leader, the crowd of supporters that were there for him were singing God Bless America as he was let out of the courtroom yesterday.
[03:37:08.243 --> 03:37:16.154]  Supporters held hands joined in prayer just outside the door to courtroom for before declaring tyranny has come to New Hampshire This is not my America.
[03:37:16.194 --> 03:37:23.483]  I couldn't say it better myself I am absolutely outraged that people like Michael Hayden would say that you should disobey
[03:37:24.696 --> 03:37:33.179]  Orders by a president to torture people when he presided over an institution that was the institution doing the torture, calling it enhanced interrogation.
[03:37:33.919 --> 03:37:38.461]  That kind of parsing of the language, those kinds of lies, they are masters at that.
[03:37:38.741 --> 03:37:44.483]  And of course people like Michael Hayden, who work with the NSA, who work with the CIA, are masters of deception.
[03:37:45.103 --> 03:37:46.685]  That's what this dark government is about.
[03:37:46.725 --> 03:37:47.486]  It's about deception.
[03:37:47.686 --> 03:38:00.722]  And to say that these people have a right to disobey immoral, unconstitutional laws like torture, and to say that we, as citizens, don't have the right to disobey unlawful, immoral, unconstitutional orders from our government?
[03:38:01.343 --> 03:38:05.124]  Let me tell you about the man who was in charge of this standoff, Dan Love.
[03:38:05.725 --> 03:38:07.365]  Here's something from the Salt Lake Tribune.
[03:38:08.185 --> 03:38:10.366]  This was back in October of 2014.
[03:38:11.306 --> 03:38:16.028]  Public enemy number one for rural Utah sheriffs just happens to be a fellow peace officer.
[03:38:16.048 --> 03:38:16.468]  You hear that?
[03:38:16.988 --> 03:38:18.029]  Rural sheriffs.
[03:38:18.809 --> 03:38:21.371]  Versus a federal law enforcement agent.
[03:38:21.551 --> 03:38:22.091]  Who is that?
[03:38:22.592 --> 03:38:26.755]  Dan Love, the BLM's special agent in charge.
[03:38:27.115 --> 03:38:41.285]  Elected law enforcement officers, they say in the Salt Lake Tribune, from Neffy to Blanding, call him an arrogant, dishonest bully who has little regard for local authority and dodges accountability, derailing a collaborative approach to police work on the state's federal lands.
[03:38:41.305 --> 03:38:42.486]  They want to have nothing to do.
[03:38:43.146 --> 03:38:44.467]  with the local law enforcement.
[03:38:44.867 --> 03:38:54.094]  He repudiates and gets in the faces of the people who are elected law enforcement and elected county commissioners, their local elected officials.
[03:38:54.534 --> 03:39:06.663]  Love reportedly just laughed when Garfield County Sheriff James Denny Perkins relayed ranchers' complaints about federal officers removing plastic feed tubes from the range and threatening the ranchers with litter citations.
[03:39:07.023 --> 03:39:12.604]  He drew early controversy during the undercover probe of Artifacts Trafficking and Blanding in 2009.
[03:39:13.204 --> 03:39:28.068]  In that particular probe, you had a doctor, Dr. Red, who was a local, this is a small town, very remote rural area, as Senator Orrin Hatch said to the Department of Justice.
[03:39:29.028 --> 03:39:29.669]  Eric Holder.
[03:39:30.850 --> 03:39:32.912]  I can't really get those two in my mind.
[03:39:32.932 --> 03:39:36.355]  They're such cognitive dissonance to talk about Department of Justice and Eric Holder.
[03:39:36.675 --> 03:39:45.323]  But Senator Orrin Hatch from Utah said to him, he said, we have such a hard time getting doctors to serve these remote, low-population rural areas.
[03:39:45.343 --> 03:39:47.665]  This guy was deeply beloved by his community.
[03:39:48.525 --> 03:39:49.346]  They came after him.
[03:39:51.224 --> 03:39:52.504]  Dan Love came after him.
[03:39:52.564 --> 03:39:55.665]  There was a bead that was half the size of a dime.
[03:39:56.466 --> 03:40:00.307]  They valued it at $2,000 so they could get a felony charge for him.
[03:40:00.807 --> 03:40:13.731]  They burst onto his land with over 100 agents, manhandled him, put him in his garage, tied him up, interrogated him for over four hours, told him his life was over, his medical career was over, and he subsequently committed suicide.
[03:40:14.571 --> 03:40:18.696]  Along with the informant who talked about this, and two other people.
[03:40:19.397 --> 03:40:26.604]  This is the kind of in-your-face iron fist that this special agent from the BLM, Dan Love, is ruling with.
[03:40:26.945 --> 03:40:30.829]  Now, they say top state officials, even in Utah, want Love to go.
[03:40:31.750 --> 03:40:35.272]  This is untenable, said Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox.
[03:40:35.673 --> 03:40:41.417]  There comes a time when personalities get in the way of productivity, and for his part, they say, Dan Love is not talking.
[03:40:41.917 --> 03:40:50.943]  Now we have another sheriff, Rick Eldridge of Perkins and San Juan County, said rangers pull over citizens without probable cause, even in areas where they have no jurisdiction.
[03:40:50.963 --> 03:40:52.284]  They bully ranch hands.
[03:40:52.324 --> 03:40:53.545]  They berate tourists.
[03:40:54.005 --> 03:40:57.247]  For parking vehicles off of dirt roads and illegally closed roads.
[03:40:57.567 --> 03:41:02.589]  Federal officers refuse to help with searches and rescues and when they do, they get in the way.
[03:41:03.149 --> 03:41:05.490]  Now this is what we've seen also in Oregon.
[03:41:05.611 --> 03:41:07.211]  Of course, Dan Love is not up in Oregon.
[03:41:07.251 --> 03:41:09.993]  He is over Utah and Nevada.
[03:41:10.193 --> 03:41:11.914]  But we have seen this in Oregon as well.
[03:41:12.394 --> 03:41:16.456]  That's why we had the sheriff up there in Grant County, Palmer.
[03:41:17.136 --> 03:41:20.217]  Who was trying to help the people in his area.
[03:41:20.257 --> 03:41:21.558]  Now they're coming after that sheriff.
[03:41:21.818 --> 03:41:24.258]  They're trying to get his law enforcement credentials removed.
[03:41:24.619 --> 03:41:28.740]  That's what happens when sheriffs stand up to this kind of tyranny from the federal government.
[03:41:28.760 --> 03:41:34.222]  We got a Paiute County Sheriff, that was reported a couple of days ago, talking about the Forest Service personnel.
[03:41:34.502 --> 03:41:39.824]  And he says, if I have to, I'm going to deputize every man, woman, and child in this county to stop these people.
[03:41:39.884 --> 03:41:43.345]  What do we do when they come against our elected officials?
[03:41:43.991 --> 03:41:49.133]  There was a ride of ATVs in a park area that was shut down by Dan Love.
[03:41:49.793 --> 03:41:53.374]  They called it the Recapture Ride because it was in, I think, Recapture Canyon.
[03:41:53.454 --> 03:41:55.435]  This is an area that had ATVs.
[03:41:56.055 --> 03:41:58.996]  And this has been promoted, been done for many, many years.
[03:41:59.116 --> 03:42:07.359]  A trail where they allow them to ride the ATVs through these vast, vast number of acres that the government claims that they own.
[03:42:07.839 --> 03:42:12.282]  And it's being ruled by this guy, Dan Love, as if he was a sheriff of Nottingham.
[03:42:12.782 --> 03:42:15.303]  And as they were writing these, they did a protest.
[03:42:15.323 --> 03:42:18.645]  And this was really, more than anything, about jurisdictional conflicts.
[03:42:18.665 --> 03:42:22.688]  This was led by some county commissioners, but they had hundreds of people there.
[03:42:23.368 --> 03:42:27.031]  They arrested five people for this protest ride through the canyon.
[03:42:27.591 --> 03:42:30.953]  One of those five people was one of the outspoken daughters of the doctor.
[03:42:31.213 --> 03:42:36.677]  And of course, the doctor himself had been charged previously with some crimes he had won in court.
[03:42:37.017 --> 03:42:41.480]  This is a pattern of behavior we've seen over and over again with these people from the federal government.
[03:42:41.860 --> 03:42:49.505]  They come after somebody with a ridiculous charge, they lose in court, and then it becomes a multi-year vendetta for them until they get even.
[03:42:49.546 --> 03:42:53.228]  And that's what we're now seeing in the Bundy Ranch standoff.
[03:42:53.888 --> 03:43:04.496]  One of the people, one of the county commissioners who was part of that recapture ride, that protest ride, was that the BLM came after him, tried to get a 16-month sentence against him.
[03:43:04.616 --> 03:43:05.837]  Jail term, 16 months.
[03:43:06.177 --> 03:43:08.759]  Although the maximum sentence would have been 12 months.
[03:43:08.779 --> 03:43:09.859]  They tried for 16 months.
[03:43:09.899 --> 03:43:11.360]  Instead, they got 10 days.
[03:43:12.361 --> 03:43:23.245]  They charged him a fine of $96,000, claiming that there was damage done to government land, and that he was ultimately responsible for this.
[03:43:23.285 --> 03:43:28.067]  We've even had other special agents in charge from the Bureau of Land Management complain about this.
[03:43:28.107 --> 03:43:28.587]  Steve Martin.
[03:43:29.347 --> 03:43:31.028]  Talking about what happened at the Bundy Ranch.
[03:43:31.048 --> 03:43:35.171]  He said he was listening to details of a clandestine operation in Arizona.
[03:43:35.211 --> 03:43:36.352]  He's based in Arizona.
[03:43:36.792 --> 03:43:42.396]  He said he was listening to details in the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Artesia, New Mexico.
[03:43:42.897 --> 03:43:49.381]  And he said the plan was full of unduly optimistic bravado and it lacked a key ingredient.
[03:43:49.781 --> 03:43:51.182]  Cooperation with the county sheriff.
[03:43:51.563 --> 03:43:54.665]  And he said, I remember thinking, is this still the BLM?
[03:43:55.265 --> 03:43:57.107]  This is something that has been going on since 1978.
[03:43:57.548 --> 03:44:05.336]  At that time, they got their first 15 agents, they dressed them like park rangers, they gave them pistols, but then throughout the 80s, they began militarizing this organization.
[03:44:05.376 --> 03:44:13.144]  And we have to understand, as Ron Paul has said, if they get these weapons, if they militarize themselves, they're going to use it against you.
[03:44:13.364 --> 03:44:15.887]  And we've seen this now with the Department of Education.
[03:44:16.187 --> 03:44:19.689]  Doing SWAT teams against people that are behind in their student loans.
[03:44:19.749 --> 03:44:22.011]  It is absolutely amazing.
[03:44:22.251 --> 03:44:28.055]  You have to understand, to paraphrase Pastor Martin Niemuller, who said, you know, first they came for this group, then they came for that one.
[03:44:28.455 --> 03:44:31.237]  First they came for the miners and nobody did anything about that.
[03:44:31.257 --> 03:44:39.002]  Then they came after the loggers and people said, well, I would rather let the forest burn than to let these people earn a living taking out deadwood.
[03:44:39.022 --> 03:44:40.363]  And that's truly what has happened now.
[03:44:40.763 --> 03:44:41.764]  Then they came for the ranchers.
[03:44:41.784 --> 03:44:46.027]  You got all these people in the city saying, I hate people who are rednecks, who live out in the forest.
[03:44:46.047 --> 03:44:47.508]  They don't understand what's going on with this.
[03:44:48.009 --> 03:44:49.970]  Now they are coming for the sheriffs.
[03:44:51.151 --> 03:44:52.512]  Do you understand what's happening now?
[03:44:52.793 --> 03:44:53.873]  They're coming for the sheriffs.
[03:44:54.094 --> 03:44:55.214]  They're coming for the journalists.
[03:44:55.375 --> 03:44:56.716]  They're coming for the protesters.
[03:44:57.496 --> 03:44:58.877]  That's where we are with this tyranny.
[03:44:59.538 --> 03:45:02.720]  They're going to be coming for you and your little comfortable suburban home.
[03:45:02.940 --> 03:45:03.781]  They're going to round you up.
[03:45:03.801 --> 03:45:07.744]  And if they don't put you in a FEMA camp, they're going to put you in a city with their Agenda 21.
[03:45:10.286 --> 03:45:11.187]  What are your comments about this?
[03:45:11.207 --> 03:45:13.089]  David, you're on fire, as usual.
[03:45:14.750 --> 03:45:19.614]  It totally defies logic, but you see this anytime the federal government thinks they're above the law.
[03:45:19.955 --> 03:45:20.275]  Oh, they are.
[03:45:20.475 --> 03:45:29.603]  And really, when you get brought up on charges, you're almost better off either taking a deal or letting them win the first time, because they will keep bringing charges against you.
[03:45:29.623 --> 03:45:31.364]  I've heard story after story from people.
[03:45:32.045 --> 03:45:36.589]  I had one, this company used to make ginseng violet, and they used to put it in chicken feed.
[03:45:37.129 --> 03:45:39.832]  Because it would keep the chickens from getting salmonella and worms.
[03:45:40.172 --> 03:45:40.552]  Wow!
[03:45:41.393 --> 03:45:44.696]  Okay, you didn't hear about salmonella and worms in the 70s.
[03:45:45.056 --> 03:45:47.998]  The 80s, the feds went against these guys and they beat them.
[03:45:49.079 --> 03:45:51.241]  The ginger and violet producers beat them.
[03:45:51.421 --> 03:45:55.665]  They went to court six more times until they finally beat them and said, well, this causes cancer, you can't put this in chicken feed.
[03:45:55.785 --> 03:45:59.367]  Now we've got salmonella in eggs.
[03:46:00.388 --> 03:46:01.968]  The government doesn't care if it's wrong.
[03:46:02.329 --> 03:46:03.429]  It only cares if it wins.
[03:46:04.010 --> 03:46:05.250]  It does not care at all.
[03:46:05.310 --> 03:46:07.812]  We've got the FDA, we've got the DEA, we've got all these tyrannies.
[03:46:07.832 --> 03:46:12.154]  We've got the EPA putting fines on people thinking that they own all the property.
[03:46:12.674 --> 03:46:16.176]  They're the ones who are making the massive pollution, blowing up that gold mine.
[03:46:16.196 --> 03:46:17.277]  Everybody told them it was going to happen.
[03:46:17.577 --> 03:46:23.540]  And even the retired mining engineer said they're doing this so they can create a super fund for themselves and expand their fiefdom.
[03:46:23.940 --> 03:46:29.743]  I think the real remedy for this, for the moment, what we can do as citizens, we have to educate each other on jury nullification.
[03:46:29.943 --> 03:46:31.424]  The Bundys are going to be coming up for trial.
[03:46:31.704 --> 03:46:35.066]  It made me sick to see this county commissioner convicted in this court.
[03:46:35.086 --> 03:46:37.187]  It made me sick to see the Hammonds convicted in court.
[03:46:37.527 --> 03:46:39.928]  People need to stop being sheep.
[03:46:40.208 --> 03:46:43.650]  You need to understand that when you're a juror, you need to look at this and say,
[03:46:44.781 --> 03:46:50.094]  Is it warranted for the government to send the Bundys to jail for 40 years for what happened there?
[03:46:50.885 --> 03:46:58.990]  Wasn't the actions of Dan Love and the BLM, weren't they far worse than anything that happened in that standoff?
[03:46:59.250 --> 03:47:02.633]  You have to look at this and say, alright, they got scared because weapons were brandished.
[03:47:02.653 --> 03:47:11.278]  You know, when they cleared Dan Love of wrongful death, they said, you know, just having firearms and pointing them at people, that really didn't constitute an assault.
[03:47:11.518 --> 03:47:13.240]  But that's what they're saying about the Bundys.
[03:47:13.280 --> 03:47:15.361]  They have a double standard that is so incredible.
[03:47:15.601 --> 03:47:16.502]  We have to say, look,
[03:47:17.182 --> 03:47:18.243]  I understand what's going on.
[03:47:18.583 --> 03:47:26.868]  And even if this was a conspiracy to stop the government from moving this cattle, I don't agree with the penalties that you're applying with this.
[03:47:26.988 --> 03:47:28.969]  And I'm not going to find these people guilty.
[03:47:29.429 --> 03:47:30.930]  And these charges are lies.
[03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:34.292]  They're charging Cliven Bundy with having, with threatening them with firearms.
[03:47:34.332 --> 03:47:36.274]  He never carried firearms the days that we were there.
[03:47:36.394 --> 03:47:39.936]  He wasn't even at the standout, the standoff at the washout.
[03:47:40.616 --> 03:47:42.077]  It is absolutely incredible.
[03:47:42.437 --> 03:47:49.880]  This is a criminal government, and I mean, we could go on and on about this, but again, there's a judge that charged the BLM with criminal conspiracy.
[03:47:49.900 --> 03:47:50.961]  You don't hear anything about that.
[03:47:51.181 --> 03:47:55.262]  In another case, in Nevada, Hagee case, he charged the BLM with that.
[03:47:55.763 --> 03:47:57.503]  Nothing about that in the mainstream press.
[03:47:57.783 --> 03:47:58.664]  Absolutely nothing.
[03:47:58.684 --> 03:48:01.145]  They get away with, literally, with murder.
[03:48:01.365 --> 03:48:11.588]  They pick and choose, and now it's a Trump staffer, just about, is what they're calling this guy, you know, got arrested, and he's just involved in his own little group, but they're trying to tie it to Donald Trump.
[03:48:11.608 --> 03:48:14.709]  And then you got this meme contest that Alex put out yesterday.
[03:48:14.729 --> 03:48:16.909]  It was a flash meme contest.
[03:48:17.189 --> 03:48:17.609]  $1,000 for the winner.
[03:48:17.649 --> 03:48:19.770]  We're going to put out the winner today.
[03:48:20.230 --> 03:48:21.291]  We're going to pick it here on the air.
[03:48:21.311 --> 03:48:23.512]  Yeah, we want to do this and we're going to have a little bit of fun with that.
[03:48:23.552 --> 03:48:28.114]  Before, while we're still on something kind of serious, Brian in Texas has been holding for a very long time.
[03:48:28.134 --> 03:48:29.135]  We want to talk about health care.
[03:48:29.795 --> 03:48:30.536]  Let's go to Brian.
[03:48:30.556 --> 03:48:31.816]  I know he's been holding for a long time.
[03:48:31.856 --> 03:48:32.376]  Brian, go ahead.
[03:48:33.717 --> 03:48:36.159]  Hey, David, Rob, it's a pleasure to be on with you guys today.
[03:48:36.179 --> 03:48:36.879]  Can you hear me okay?
[03:48:37.059 --> 03:48:37.319]  Hear you.
[03:48:37.339 --> 03:48:37.919]  Thank you for calling.
[03:48:37.939 --> 03:48:38.220]  Go ahead.
[03:48:39.320 --> 03:48:39.660]  Very good.
[03:48:39.700 --> 03:48:40.101]  Thank you.
[03:48:40.121 --> 03:48:45.203]  Hey, I got a question about health care and let me build this scenario before I ask you guys.
[03:48:45.544 --> 03:48:48.165]  Okay, so let's say Donald Trump is elected president.
[03:48:49.136 --> 03:48:56.722]  And let's say, like in his book, he takes care of all the waste, abuse, and fraud in the government, and that saves a lot of money.
[03:48:56.762 --> 03:49:02.987]  Let's say we get rid of the... Did you see his health care plan that they didn't talk about in the debate last night that he published yesterday?
[03:49:03.547 --> 03:49:04.568]  The seven-point health care plan?
[03:49:04.588 --> 03:49:05.049]  Yeah, I did.
[03:49:05.069 --> 03:49:05.249]  Okay.
[03:49:05.709 --> 03:49:06.450]  Absolutely, I did.
[03:49:06.470 --> 03:49:07.510]  Yeah, sure.
[03:49:07.991 --> 03:49:14.856]  But anyway, so let's say we save a lot of money, he brings the corporate jobs back over by cutting the corporate tax rate.
[03:49:14.876 --> 03:49:18.079]  Let's just say the economy is flourishing after he gets elected.
[03:49:19.154 --> 03:49:24.418]  My question is based around the single-payer health care system.
[03:49:24.918 --> 03:49:26.759]  I'm a major advocate for a free market.
[03:49:26.799 --> 03:49:27.319]  I think it works.
[03:49:27.399 --> 03:49:27.940]  I think it's great.
[03:49:28.400 --> 03:49:40.228]  But concerning health care, with that scenario in place that I described, assuming that we have honest people in government, with that assumption, could a single health care
[03:49:45.249 --> 03:49:45.769]  I don't agree.
[03:49:45.789 --> 03:49:59.602]  I think that when you eliminate competition, listen, when Hillary Clinton was pushing her healthcare takeover back in the beginning of the Clinton administration, they kept saying, we need a single payer healthcare because it's going to make things cheaper.
[03:49:59.662 --> 03:50:01.003]  No, competition makes things cheaper.
[03:50:01.283 --> 03:50:19.301]  If you look at Donald Trump's plan, what he has here are multiple aspects to give us price transparency so we can make decisions, give us the ability to make the purchases ourselves, to create competition between health insurance companies, to remove this restriction of trade that is around state lines.
[03:50:19.321 --> 03:50:21.603]  Right now they cannot trade across state lines.
[03:50:21.783 --> 03:50:22.424]  What is wrong with that?
[03:50:22.444 --> 03:50:26.348]  I mean, one of the charges against the Bundys is that they inhibited interstate commerce.
[03:50:26.428 --> 03:50:30.272]  The government is inhibiting interstate commerce with healthcare providers.
[03:50:30.532 --> 03:50:31.713]  I mean, it's absolutely crazy.
[03:50:31.773 --> 03:50:37.779]  They would allow this kind of transparency, letting people know what the costs are in hospitals and clinics.
[03:50:38.100 --> 03:50:39.441]  There's nothing in this plan at all.
[03:50:39.481 --> 03:50:45.287]  There's seven points, and there's nothing in here at all about having a single-payer plan.
[03:50:45.467 --> 03:50:51.212]  Anything run by the government is designed to fail, cost way too much, and be inefficient.
[03:50:51.312 --> 03:50:54.214]  That is the hallmark of a government plan.
[03:50:54.374 --> 03:50:54.595]  Yes.
[03:50:54.635 --> 03:50:57.537]  So you're never going to have, whatever, it doesn't matter what it is.
[03:50:57.597 --> 03:50:58.758]  It could be building a bridge.
[03:50:59.158 --> 03:50:59.999]  It's not going to work.
[03:51:00.560 --> 03:51:03.482]  It's going to cost too much, and it'll break in a few years.
[03:51:03.742 --> 03:51:06.825]  That's just what they do.
[03:51:07.425 --> 03:51:08.646]  There's many reasons why that is.
[03:51:08.686 --> 03:51:11.869]  Hang on, we're going to be right back, and we're going to go to this meme contest and judge the winner.
[03:51:11.889 --> 03:51:18.410]  It's our secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[03:51:18.570 --> 03:51:23.011]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[03:51:23.211 --> 03:51:33.813]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary broad-spectrum antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[03:51:34.013 --> 03:51:39.274]  Supernatural Silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers.
[03:51:39.474 --> 03:51:47.620]  Using a patented technology that is highly effective against colds, flus, infections, food poisoning, and yeast, in addition to many other pathogens.

[03:52:24.764 --> 03:52:26.405]  I was kind of run down.
[03:52:26.665 --> 03:52:28.466]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[03:52:28.626 --> 03:52:30.487]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:52:30.507 --> 03:52:32.308]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[03:52:32.328 --> 03:52:33.109]  I popped two of them.
[03:52:33.389 --> 03:52:35.530]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[03:52:35.670 --> 03:52:37.551]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:52:37.632 --> 03:52:38.912]  It's got four and a half stars.

[03:52:50.339 --> 03:52:54.222]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:52:54.382 --> 03:53:00.187]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:53:00.527 --> 03:53:06.452]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[03:54:15.439 --> 03:54:16.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:16.680 --> 03:54:17.761]  I'm David Knight with Rob Dew.
[03:54:17.781 --> 03:54:19.982]  We're going to take a look at the meme contest.
[03:54:20.002 --> 03:54:22.884]  We're going to pick a winner right now in this segment.
[03:54:22.904 --> 03:54:24.945]  You know, ridicule is a very powerful weapon.
[03:54:25.306 --> 03:54:28.608]  It's one of Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals.
[03:54:28.648 --> 03:54:30.149]  Hillary Clinton is well aware of that.
[03:54:30.489 --> 03:54:31.790]  And so we want to encourage that.
[03:54:31.830 --> 03:54:34.652]  And of course, this is a $1,000 contest we're doing right now.
[03:54:35.112 --> 03:54:36.353]  I'd help us do this type of thing.
[03:54:36.393 --> 03:54:38.834]  Remember we've got a sale on Silver Bullet, 50% off.
[03:54:38.894 --> 03:54:41.355]  You can find that at Infowarslife.com.
[03:54:41.715 --> 03:54:47.978]  Support your health, support our operations so we can continue to get in their face and ridicule these tyrants.
[03:54:47.998 --> 03:54:49.379]  Let's take a look at some of these memes.
[03:54:49.479 --> 03:54:52.720]  So this tweet in over a day got 92,000 impressions.
[03:54:52.740 --> 03:54:54.141]  Here's a finalist number one.
[03:54:54.681 --> 03:54:55.562]  It's got the lizards.
[03:54:56.676 --> 03:54:57.797]  So there you go.
[03:54:57.817 --> 03:54:58.577]  I'll set it up for you.
[03:54:58.597 --> 03:54:58.818]  I got it.
[03:54:58.898 --> 03:54:59.198]  I got it.
[03:54:59.298 --> 03:54:59.858]  I'll get it for you.
[03:54:59.898 --> 03:55:00.319]  There we go.
[03:55:00.359 --> 03:55:01.179]  So there's some.
[03:55:01.199 --> 03:55:02.120]  I turned them on to losers.
[03:55:02.480 --> 03:55:04.481]  No title necessary.
[03:55:05.802 --> 03:55:06.463]  That was a good one.
[03:55:06.503 --> 03:55:09.245]  This also got 687 replies.
[03:55:09.805 --> 03:55:10.386]  Here's number two.
[03:55:10.406 --> 03:55:11.326]  This is the one Alex likes.
[03:55:11.526 --> 03:55:12.107]  I like this one too.
[03:55:12.127 --> 03:55:12.567]  This is good.
[03:55:12.827 --> 03:55:13.508]  Snakes on a plane.
[03:55:14.833 --> 03:55:17.974]  That picture of Jeb Bush, I just couldn't believe that was real.
[03:55:18.014 --> 03:55:24.095]  And we had three different people who submitted a Snakes on a Plane version.
[03:55:24.155 --> 03:55:28.436]  This was the first one, James, so I put him as the final.
[03:55:28.496 --> 03:55:29.656]  I didn't take the other two.
[03:55:30.117 --> 03:55:32.197]  Losing control has never been so funny.
[03:55:32.217 --> 03:55:33.737]  I like that one.
[03:55:33.757 --> 03:55:35.298]  This is another good one.
[03:55:35.518 --> 03:55:36.398]  Plane stupid.
[03:55:38.953 --> 03:55:41.656]  We're both pun guys, so we like these puns.
[03:55:41.936 --> 03:55:44.219]  Trump fired us all and we didn't have jobs to start with.
[03:55:45.861 --> 03:55:46.762]  I really like that one.
[03:55:47.042 --> 03:55:47.743]  Here's another good one.
[03:55:47.803 --> 03:55:50.646]  That face you make as you screw Lady Liberty.
[03:55:51.206 --> 03:55:52.608]  Infowars.com.
[03:55:53.229 --> 03:55:53.909]  Here's another one.
[03:55:53.989 --> 03:55:57.513]  If you don't know what's wrong here, you are also part of the problem.
[03:55:58.644 --> 03:56:00.225]  Alright, here's another good one.
[03:56:00.265 --> 03:56:02.367]  America thinks we're conservatives.
[03:56:02.607 --> 03:56:03.488]  I like that one.
[03:56:03.608 --> 03:56:04.168]  I like that.
[03:56:04.348 --> 03:56:05.029]  I'll put that one aside.
[03:56:05.169 --> 03:56:06.650]  I like that a lot.
[03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:07.130]  Here we go.
[03:56:07.170 --> 03:56:13.435]  So, whenever Trump brings up 28 pages out at the Fed or a piece with Russia, let's just call him a racist bigot.
[03:56:13.755 --> 03:56:14.196]  That's it.
[03:56:14.216 --> 03:56:15.036]  That's how we do it.
[03:56:15.917 --> 03:56:16.838]  Here's another good one.
[03:56:17.198 --> 03:56:19.700]  They still don't know we're working for Hillary.
[03:56:21.318 --> 03:56:23.839]  Uh, Americans still think there are two parties.
[03:56:24.319 --> 03:56:25.139]  Oh, that's great too.
[03:56:25.159 --> 03:56:25.980]  These pig bellies.
[03:56:26.000 --> 03:56:30.321]  Now this one, uh, this is George Bush as the emperor, Palpatine.
[03:56:30.801 --> 03:56:32.422]  He's giving them orders and they're all loving it.
[03:56:32.642 --> 03:56:34.203]  Help us, Obi-Wan.
[03:56:34.243 --> 03:56:34.923]  Your only hope.
[03:56:36.223 --> 03:56:37.164]  Fakes on a plane.
[03:56:37.764 --> 03:56:38.464]  Fakes on a plane.
[03:56:38.824 --> 03:56:41.365]  This one is a little crass, but it's real funny.
[03:56:41.385 --> 03:56:43.746]  Uh, douchebags now come in a three-pack.
[03:56:46.054 --> 03:56:48.436]  And this is the last of the official finalists.
[03:56:49.357 --> 03:56:53.039]  And then I said, Trump didn't build his business, and they all laugh about it.
[03:56:53.139 --> 03:56:54.740]  And then here's one I did last night.
[03:56:55.241 --> 03:56:56.202]  Cock knockers.
[03:56:57.783 --> 03:56:59.884]  And then this is one Kit Daniels did.
[03:57:00.325 --> 03:57:03.547]  After we steal it from Trump, we'll pretend to hate Hillary.
[03:57:04.067 --> 03:57:08.150]  So, you know, that's 15 finalists there of that.
[03:57:08.190 --> 03:57:09.911]  Just in one day, we got a lot of great entries.
[03:57:09.931 --> 03:57:11.753]  There's plenty of entries to choose from.
[03:57:12.353 --> 03:57:16.396]  And, um, you know, I think where we're at, though, is Snakes on a Plane, and you like that one.
[03:57:16.416 --> 03:57:17.077]  Yeah, I like that one.
[03:57:17.097 --> 03:57:20.959]  I like the one about conservatives, because it really, you know, that or the two parties.
[03:57:20.979 --> 03:57:22.440]  So here's the Snakes on a Plane one.
[03:57:22.460 --> 03:57:24.562]  The lizard one's really good, but we don't want to talk about that.
[03:57:24.582 --> 03:57:28.304]  But I like the picture of Jeb, so, I mean, you can't cover up Jeb with a liver.
[03:57:28.385 --> 03:57:32.868]  I mean, that is just, he is the lizard face.
[03:57:32.888 --> 03:57:33.848]  The little potbelly.
[03:57:33.908 --> 03:57:35.950]  The little potbelly, right there.
[03:57:35.970 --> 03:57:38.512]  Uh, let's see, where's this other one?
[03:57:38.592 --> 03:57:41.434]  Oh, that face you make is, I think these are our three finalists right here.
[03:57:42.321 --> 03:57:42.801]  Right there.
[03:57:43.562 --> 03:57:44.523]  So I guess we get to choose.
[03:57:44.543 --> 03:57:44.963]  How do we decide?
[03:57:45.003 --> 03:57:45.443]  I don't know.
[03:57:45.804 --> 03:57:50.767]  Should we flip a Hillary coin and see which one wins six times in a row?
[03:57:50.787 --> 03:57:51.608]  Daria, what do you think?
[03:57:51.648 --> 03:57:52.549]  We'll let Daria decide.
[03:57:52.569 --> 03:57:55.651]  We're going to put her on the spot.
[03:57:55.691 --> 03:57:57.012]  Which one do you think wins out of these?
[03:57:59.076 --> 03:57:59.437]  Which one?
[03:57:59.857 --> 03:58:00.178]  This one?
[03:58:00.418 --> 03:58:01.519]  These two.
[03:58:01.559 --> 03:58:01.960]  Narrow it down.
[03:58:01.980 --> 03:58:03.141]  Alright, narrow it down to these two.
[03:58:03.502 --> 03:58:04.924]  Nico, what do you think?
[03:58:05.344 --> 03:58:06.466]  Snakes or conservatives?
[03:58:06.967 --> 03:58:07.728]  Clock is ticking.
[03:58:07.868 --> 03:58:08.769]  Let's go with conservatives.
[03:58:09.290 --> 03:58:10.852]  America thinks we're conservatives.
[03:58:10.872 --> 03:58:13.635]  So that would be, uh, can't stump the Trump.
[03:58:15.077 --> 03:58:16.118]  Oh, there you go.
[03:58:16.138 --> 03:58:17.579]  Can't stump the Trump.
[03:58:17.619 --> 03:58:19.060]  That is an amazing meme.
[03:58:19.220 --> 03:58:21.162]  That's the way you take these people down.
[03:58:21.202 --> 03:58:22.263]  You ridicule them.
[03:58:22.343 --> 03:58:23.224]  It's a very powerful weapon.
[03:58:23.244 --> 03:58:23.804]  RobDeedInfoWars.com.
[03:58:23.844 --> 03:58:24.665]  Send me an email.
[03:58:24.845 --> 03:58:25.565]  Can't stump the Trump.
[03:58:25.605 --> 03:58:26.666]  We'll get in contact with you.
[03:58:27.087 --> 03:58:28.728]  Get you that $1,000 winning.
[03:58:29.288 --> 03:58:29.849]  Snake's on a plane.
[03:58:29.869 --> 03:58:30.509]  You almost made it.
[03:58:30.890 --> 03:58:31.650]  There was three of those.
[03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:33.192]  That was James Russell's the third.
[03:58:33.212 --> 03:58:35.153]  Hey, thanks to everybody for entering.
[03:58:35.173 --> 03:58:35.934]  These are all great memes.
[03:58:35.974 --> 03:58:37.095]  Spread these memes out.
[03:58:37.175 --> 03:58:37.555]  That's how.
[03:58:37.875 --> 03:58:39.076]  It's not just this one tweet.
[03:58:39.157 --> 03:58:39.817]  Tweet them.
[03:58:39.937 --> 03:58:40.658]  Just keep tweeting them.
[03:58:40.778 --> 03:58:41.238]  Tweet them.
