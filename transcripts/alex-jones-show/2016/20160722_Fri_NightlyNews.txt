[00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.307]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.387 --> 00:00:23.708]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:25.669]  It is July 22, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.949]  Tonight!
[00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.351]  Manhunt in Munich.
[00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:40.296]  A shooting at a shopping mall has left eight people dead and multiple people injured.
[00:00:40.816 --> 00:00:43.898]  Meanwhile, the suspects remain at large.
[00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:53.466]  Then, the water supply in a small town in Colorado was found tainted with THC, the main chemical in marijuana.
[00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:57.829]  And there are signs that someone may have deliberately put it there.
[00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:04.434]  Plus, an ass-kicking constitutional lawman is taking on criminals in our government.
[00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:13.102]  You get this politically correct, you know, crap from the world about, you know, please don't hurt anybody's feelings, you know, while they're shooting families in the head.
[00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:18.886]  You know, this is, this is, this is the nature of the country we live in now and I just don't participate.
[00:01:19.147 --> 00:01:24.011]  All that plus more from the RNC up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:02.377]  Hi, I'm Dr. David Jones.
[00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:05.420]  I've been in practice for over 30 years in dentistry.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.444]  In our health histories, we've always asked what people's primary complaint were.
[00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:12.006]  A third of the time, it's, I want whiter teeth.
[00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:26.279]  In the early days of dentistry, we used some fairly harsh chemicals in order to bleach the teeth and whiten them, and people were happy with the results, even though it created hypersensitivity and some problems that I consider fairly high risk.
[00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.901]  Recently, I was exposed to the Ghost Smile System.
[00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:36.324]  It allows a whitening gel to be applied to the teeth with a very good ultrasonic toothbrush system.
[00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:51.691]  The gel is activated by a light-emitting diode, or actually two light-emitting diodes, so it's a simple and elegant procedure that delivers office-quality whitening, and you don't have to spend the $600 it typically costs for an in-office treatment.
[00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:55.797]  In my opinion, it's the most elegant and best value that I've ever seen.
[00:02:56.017 --> 00:02:59.823]  To get your GoSmile system, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:03:01.616 --> 00:03:08.460]  This week we've seen no shortage of craziness at the RNC, but next week at the DNC there may be craziness for a different reason.
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.342]  We see WikiLeaks releases nearly 20,000 hacked DNC emails.
[00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:24.750]  It's unclear how WikiLeaks obtained the records, but the release comes weeks after a hacker, or hackers, going by the name Guccifer 2.0, began releasing records obtained through the DNC's computer system.
[00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.713]  Hackers claim to be Romanian, but many suspect the records were taken by a team of Russian hackers.
[00:03:31.314 --> 00:03:33.555]  The DNC, which is chaired by Florida Rep.
[00:03:33.595 --> 00:03:36.797]  Debbie Schultz, has acknowledged their systems were infiltrated.
[00:03:37.177 --> 00:03:40.760]  The party has not commented on specific information released through the hack.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.765]  According to WikiLeaks, which is operated by Julian Assange, the release is part one of a new series it's calling the Hillary Leaks.
[00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:52.207]  So it seems like things are just not going too well for Mrs. Clinton.
[00:03:52.247 --> 00:03:57.431]  Granted, she stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders, but other than that, she has a lot of things she's going to have to contend with.
[00:03:57.711 --> 00:03:59.872]  And this is just one of the things that's happening at the DNC.
[00:04:00.913 --> 00:04:03.456]  There's going to be a whole bunch of shenanigans going on out there.
[00:04:04.657 --> 00:04:08.402]  I heard that at one point they're going to have a fart-in, a quote fart-in.
[00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:15.130]  Bernie Sanders supporters were going to go eat a bunch of pork and beans and broccoli and everything else and go fart in the DNC.
[00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:17.352]  I'm glad I'm not going.
[00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:18.633]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:04:18.993 --> 00:04:22.535]  So that's one of the things that you can expect to see when it comes to DNC.
[00:04:22.555 --> 00:04:34.563]  And speaking of Hillary, remember that tomorrow, Saturday, from 12 to 2, if you're in the city of Miami, Florida, you can head down to Florida National University Arena and you can see the Hillary for Prison banners flying around.
[00:04:35.203 --> 00:04:35.544]  I think so.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:05:04.097]  Let's talk about her VP choice, because earlier this week we got the news that Mike Pence was going to be the VP for Donald J. Trump, and now there's a lot of speculation of who Hillary is going to choose to be her sidekick, so to speak, in that VP spot.
[00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:06.920]  And they say, sources are saying that it's Senator Tim Kaine
[00:05:07.521 --> 00:05:08.782]  And he is the likely choice.
[00:05:08.822 --> 00:05:13.466]  They say, as sources told Fox News, that Kaine was the frontrunner.
[00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:22.393]  They have others considered for the position, also including Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.
[00:05:22.413 --> 00:05:25.155]  They say he's a late entry, which is somewhat surprising.
[00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:29.559]  A lot of people speculated that it was going to be Bernie Sanders, possibly Joe Biden.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.882]  I thought it was going to be Sanders, to be quite honest with you, because after all the things that happened to him, I thought they'd at least, you know, dangle him the carrot.
[00:05:38.182 --> 00:05:41.823]  Hey, come help us tow the party line, but I guess he got his 30 pieces of silver.
[00:05:42.483 --> 00:05:46.404]  And I just love the memes with Bernie Sanders, because he was supposed to be the different one.
[00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:48.625]  He wasn't like all these other politicians.
[00:05:48.645 --> 00:05:49.885]  He's on the bus to the big banks.
[00:05:50.186 --> 00:05:54.787]  Now he's supporting the woman supported by the big banks, and it's all just gone downhill.
[00:05:55.387 --> 00:05:57.929]  A lot of people say that Bernie really wasn't in it to win it.
[00:05:57.989 --> 00:06:02.353]  He was just trying to push the agenda so far left that he could get some of his policies through.
[00:06:02.373 --> 00:06:03.414]  And he has achieved that.
[00:06:03.454 --> 00:06:12.481]  They're definitely talking points that Hillary will have to adopt to get that Sanders base on her ticket and not go to Trump or just not sit the election out.
[00:06:12.521 --> 00:06:15.604]  So in that regard, I think Bernie Sanders was successful.
[00:06:15.644 --> 00:06:19.006]  But the Democratic Party in general is just not anything I want to
[00:06:19.747 --> 00:06:20.228]  Deal with.
[00:06:20.248 --> 00:06:22.310]  That also includes the Republican Party.
[00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.973]  And to an extent, a Libertarian ticket.
[00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:30.839]  I think the Libertarians are capable of doing a lot of good things, but they haven't really done it this election cycle.
[00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:34.483]  They got guys, you know, running around in thongs at the conventions.
[00:06:34.663 --> 00:06:39.569]  I don't know what's going on with the Libertarian Party, but that's just one aspect of it.
[00:06:40.478 --> 00:06:49.323]  Now as we talk about Hillary, they say that pretty much any criticism of Hillary Clinton is considered a war against women, an attack on women, which is very interesting.
[00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:58.108]  I'd like to stay on this for one second because before Obama, you know, you watch the late night shows, the talk shows, the stand-up comedians, they always made fun of presidents.
[00:06:58.188 --> 00:07:07.413]  It was nothing new about it going back, even before we had TV and, you know, the modern conveniences, you had jesters making fun of the kings and the queens and all this stuff going back
[00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:08.394]  We're good to go.
[00:07:29.497 --> 00:07:34.822]  You're a bigot, you're a racist, if Hillary gets elected you're going to be a sexist, on and on and on.
[00:07:35.162 --> 00:07:42.728]  So the paradigm has completely shifted in what we would normally consider to be the war on race or religion or sex or anything to that nature.
[00:07:43.109 --> 00:07:52.116]  And now as I'm talking about a war on women, let's talk about a real war on women that's going unreported right now, and that's Russia's worst ever sex trafficker targeted 90 women
[00:07:53.217 --> 00:08:00.719]  Including a girl age 10 and he treated himself to a victim every birthday in a 41 year reign of terror.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.320]  He has become known as the birthday rapist.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.482]  He's a 69 year old and he raped women in Moscow and is expected to die in prison.
[00:08:09.195 --> 00:08:12.436]  And it was dubbed one of the most complex cases in Russian history.
[00:08:12.976 --> 00:08:16.038]  They had to go under suspicion with over 20,000 men.
[00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:19.639]  They said eventually DNA linked them to the suspect.
[00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:21.980]  And he is a divorced father of one.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.221]  He crept up behind his victims and choked them.
[00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:28.943]  And police are also probing claims that the pensioner carried out three murders.
[00:08:30.023 --> 00:08:38.936]  You have stories like this, you have stories of the women getting raped with iron rods in India, women being arrested for driving in foreign countries.
[00:08:39.577 --> 00:08:43.943]  Earlier this week, I believe it was a Pakistani woman who was murdered by her brother in an honor killing.
[00:08:44.264 --> 00:08:45.686]  You have all these real, true...
[00:08:46.707 --> 00:08:52.332]  Legitimate wars on women, and here in the States we're talking about whether or not women should be in the new Ghostbusters movie or not.
[00:08:52.412 --> 00:09:06.845]  And to an extent, I heard somebody talk about this, if that's the worst thing that's going on in our country as far as the public consciousness, there's plenty of real issues, but as far as pop culture and the public consciousness, if women being in the Ghostbusters movie is the worst thing that's going on right now,
[00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:10.367]  We live in a pretty good country, if that's our biggest concern.
[00:09:10.607 --> 00:09:12.827]  And I'm not saying it's good or bad that the women are in the movie.
[00:09:12.847 --> 00:09:14.708]  I'm just saying this is what people are talking about.
[00:09:14.968 --> 00:09:17.789]  Like, there's nothing else going on in the universe.
[00:09:18.009 --> 00:09:18.869]  I haven't seen the movie.
[00:09:19.469 --> 00:09:20.849]  I don't know what the big hubbub is.
[00:09:21.209 --> 00:09:23.010]  If you don't want to watch the movie, don't watch the movie.
[00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.751]  Like, there's a new Lethal Weapon TV show coming out.
[00:09:25.811 --> 00:09:26.931]  I have no desire to watch it.
[00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:29.691]  There's a Rush Hour TV show that's made for CBS.
[00:09:29.912 --> 00:09:31.492]  You probably don't even know they did that.
[00:09:31.812 --> 00:09:35.076]  And I had no intention of watching that either, so they can remake whatever they want.
[00:09:35.136 --> 00:09:38.079]  I'm gonna stick to the source material and everything else and go fly a kite.
[00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:45.695]  And flying kites to just being high as a kite, we see that a town's water supply has been spiked with THC.
[00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:53.762]  And this is in Colorado, and they say THC is the main chemical in marijuana, and there are signs that someone may have deliberately put it there.
[00:09:53.822 --> 00:09:54.223]  You think?
[00:09:54.863 --> 00:09:59.848]  Everyone in the town of Hugo and on the eastern plains has been warned not to drink the water.
[00:09:59.968 --> 00:10:01.850]  I wonder how many people will heed that warning.
[00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.712]  So basically somebody spiked it with THC.
[00:10:03.772 --> 00:10:07.136]  How they did it, why they did it, I don't really know, but in a state like Colorado,
[00:10:21.934 --> 00:10:25.397]  I guess it was just a matter of time before somebody tried this type of deal.
[00:10:26.137 --> 00:10:31.541]  There's many different ways you can get high off THC or marijuana without drugging other people.
[00:10:31.642 --> 00:10:34.003]  If you choose to get high, get high yourself.
[00:10:34.063 --> 00:10:39.928]  Don't force it upon other people, whoever may have pulled this, I don't know if stunt is the proper word for it.
[00:10:40.448 --> 00:10:45.652]  Now, somebody who's pulling a major stunt by coming after your Second Amendment rights, this is the AG in Massachusetts.
[00:10:46.253 --> 00:10:49.976]  And let's stop for a second and think about this, because every time
[00:10:51.343 --> 00:10:52.304]  You hear these polls, right?
[00:10:52.324 --> 00:10:58.408]  You hear these polls, you know, 9 out of 10 Americans want X. Or the majority of people said they want this.
[00:10:58.888 --> 00:11:04.672]  And when they say the majority of people polled answered a certain question a certain way, that's fine.
[00:11:04.712 --> 00:11:09.455]  But when they try to say that's indicative of the United States of America, I don't really buy that.
[00:11:09.475 --> 00:11:09.956]  For example...
[00:11:11.175 --> 00:11:14.917]  Where you poll has a great deal of impact on what your answers will be.
[00:11:15.277 --> 00:11:20.879]  Case in point, earlier this year, I was like, hey, where can I go and meet some Bernie Sanders supporters?
[00:11:20.899 --> 00:11:26.982]  So I went to the University of Texas, and I did a man on the street, and lo and behold, I ran into a whole bunch of Bernie Sanders supporters.
[00:11:27.302 --> 00:11:30.084]  But I knew that Bernie Sanders was very popular with college kids.
[00:11:30.464 --> 00:11:34.966]  College kids are at the University of Texas, so let's go talk to the college kids and see who likes Bernie Sanders.
[00:11:35.586 --> 00:11:36.426]  That's exactly my point.
[00:11:36.667 --> 00:11:41.309]  If you go to a very conservative steakhouse back in the sticks somewhere, you may find some guys who love Trump.
[00:11:41.349 --> 00:11:45.751]  If you go to the gun show, you're going to find guys who are supportive of the Second Amendment.
[00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:51.473]  If you go to the anti-moms-hate-everything rallies, you're going to find people who don't want guns.
[00:11:51.493 --> 00:11:52.694]  So you're polling
[00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:57.296]  Your position, your polling location, has a lot to do with the effects of your poll.
[00:11:57.336 --> 00:12:01.258]  So, I never really believe these people when they say, Americans want this, Americans want that.
[00:12:01.518 --> 00:12:07.682]  I'm like, no, the people that you asked, if you didn't ask them a leading question, answered because you asked them a certain demographic.
[00:12:07.722 --> 00:12:17.347]  But, all that to say this, when they say everybody wants to ban your guns, or everybody wants to get rid of the, quote, assault weapons, or these military style weapons,
[00:12:17.947 --> 00:12:20.489]  I don't believe that because right here we have a case in point.
[00:12:20.869 --> 00:12:23.371]  This is the Massachusetts Attorney General.
[00:12:23.752 --> 00:12:29.436]  She came cracking down on the semi-automatic rifles and they sold a whopping 2,549 rifles in a single day.
[00:12:29.836 --> 00:12:30.597]  To put that in perspective,
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:44.030]  On a normal day in Massachusetts State, they may sell 132 like they did on Tuesday or 51 rifles like they did on Monday.
[00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:49.255]  But the day the Attorney General came out and said she wants to crack down, they sold 2,549 rifles with about 8 hours notice.
[00:12:54.981 --> 00:13:02.267]  She was trying to ban the quote copycat rifles that she felt violated the spirit of the 1998 Massachusetts assault weapons ban.
[00:13:03.108 --> 00:13:12.917]  But the problem is that Healy, the AG, inadvertently boosted sales of the very rifle she intended to prohibit as a rush on gun stores.
[00:13:13.598 --> 00:13:15.881]  So this is what you have to remember.
[00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:22.249]  Every time you see Obama or you see Feinstein or you see Hillary or anybody else, I want to ban AR-15s.
[00:13:22.309 --> 00:13:23.211]  People go out and buy the AR-15.
[00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:24.993]  I want to ban AK-47s.
[00:13:25.033 --> 00:13:26.796]  People want to go out and buy AK-47s.
[00:13:26.876 --> 00:13:28.718]  I want to have background checks to get ammo.
[00:13:28.738 --> 00:13:29.720]  People go out and buy ammo.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.382]  And it's not that all these people are planning a mass shooting.
[00:13:32.642 --> 00:13:36.484]  They just understand that the government can't be there to protect you all the time.
[00:13:36.844 --> 00:13:38.205]  I love that interview.
[00:13:38.225 --> 00:13:38.786]  What's the guy's name?
[00:13:38.806 --> 00:13:39.326]  Kurt Russell?
[00:13:39.626 --> 00:13:40.047]  The cowboy.
[00:13:40.067 --> 00:13:41.387]  He plays all those cowboys.
[00:13:41.708 --> 00:13:42.548]  And he's talking to the guy.
[00:13:43.669 --> 00:13:44.970]  And the guy's like, man, we need to ban these guns.
[00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.091]  He's like, why do you want to ban guns?
[00:13:46.111 --> 00:13:47.231]  He's like, well, we have all these shootings.
[00:13:47.251 --> 00:13:52.635]  He's like, yeah, in countries where they have stricter gun control laws, people make suicide bombs.
[00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.816]  Or they attack people with axes on trains.
[00:13:55.096 --> 00:13:58.118]  Or they get in a big semi truck and they drive on the sidewalk and they run over 200 people.
[00:13:59.019 --> 00:14:02.741]  So it's not the firearm doing these things, it's the personal mentality.
[00:14:02.781 --> 00:14:05.482]  You can take away the guns and people are just going to drive trucks on the street.
[00:14:05.502 --> 00:14:08.524]  Hell, they do it here and we have plenty of guns here.
[00:14:08.564 --> 00:14:10.165]  They did it right here in the city of Austin, Texas.
[00:14:10.485 --> 00:14:17.549]  I went to the press conference the next day myself, South by Southwest, but I understand it was an individual who did these things.
[00:14:17.809 --> 00:14:19.150]  It didn't matter what weapon he had.
[00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:25.253]  If you have the ill intent, you're going to act on that ill intent regardless of the weapon that you may be carrying.
[00:14:25.673 --> 00:14:26.774]  Now let's talk about something else.
[00:14:27.694 --> 00:14:32.178]  Now when I speak about this next story, it's not so much that I love and care about Fox News.
[00:14:32.479 --> 00:14:34.240]  I'm not defending Roger Ailes.
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.264]  I'm not backing up the story of the accusers, because I don't really know.
[00:14:38.284 --> 00:14:39.125]  I don't work at Fox News.
[00:14:39.385 --> 00:14:40.907]  I have no desire to work at Fox News.
[00:14:41.287 --> 00:14:45.231]  But as we see, Roger Ailes, he has resigned as the CEO of Fox News.
[00:14:45.631 --> 00:14:46.552]  And really, this is a
[00:14:47.913 --> 00:14:59.405]  A testament to the changing media, how the media landscape is going to continue to become something that's not the central, located, mainstream media as we know it today.
[00:14:59.425 --> 00:15:07.854]  It says the founder and chief executive officer of Fox News has resigned from his position under fire, but he will remain with the company until 2018 as a consultant.
[00:15:09.798 --> 00:15:15.700]  And the resignation marks a sudden and swift end of a 20-year reign of one of the media's most powerful moguls.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:23.202]  A man who micromanaged talent acquisition at Fox, shaped its conservative viewpoint, and turned it into a ratings giant.
[00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:27.703]  And like I said, he did this because of allegations of sexual misconduct.
[00:15:27.723 --> 00:15:28.843]  Whether that's true or not, I don't know.
[00:15:28.883 --> 00:15:29.904]  That's not the point I'm making here.
[00:15:29.924 --> 00:15:32.845]  What I'm saying is the media is changing.
[00:15:32.885 --> 00:15:36.726]  And I was reading Noam Chomsky's book last night, at least called Media Manipulation.
[00:15:36.746 --> 00:15:37.566]  I was flipping through it.
[00:15:38.287 --> 00:15:45.465]  And he was talking about the way the media controls you and how they manipulate you, how they put the propaganda out there, and a great example of this.
[00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:48.364]  And this is long before ALS, I'm just tying it all together.
[00:15:49.664 --> 00:15:51.585]  The phrase, support our troops, right?
[00:15:51.845 --> 00:16:11.111]  You have this phrase, you just put it on the bumper stickers, and you say it at the football games, and at the soccer games, the basketball games, you have the commercials and all this stuff, support our troops, support our troops, and then people get it in their mind that, hey, my dad is a troop, or my neighbor, or my friend I went to high school with is a troop, so I want to support the troops, and I support the troops.
[00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:13.874]  I just don't support every single order that they're given.
[00:16:13.935 --> 00:16:16.879]  And that's how they put this thing together, right?
[00:16:17.079 --> 00:16:20.564]  They try to make it where you can't separate the troops from the orders that they're given.
[00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:21.365]  They're one and the same.
[00:16:21.385 --> 00:16:22.526]  So you have to support the troops.
[00:16:22.807 --> 00:16:24.669]  So you have to support every order that they're given.
[00:16:24.689 --> 00:16:28.495]  You have to support the troops when they use a drone to blow up a wedding party.
[00:16:28.795 --> 00:16:29.835]  You have to support the troops.
[00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:32.376]  So they use a jet to blow up a hospital overseas.
[00:16:32.596 --> 00:16:33.596]  You have to support the troops.
[00:16:33.836 --> 00:16:37.957]  Or you have to support the feds when they give guns to Mexican drug cartels.
[00:16:37.977 --> 00:16:41.538]  Or you have to support the guys who airdrop grenades and rocket launchers to ISIS.
[00:16:42.078 --> 00:16:43.118]  They're one and the same now.
[00:16:43.478 --> 00:16:47.079]  So you have this mixed up blended thing that cannot be separated.
[00:16:47.379 --> 00:16:49.840]  And that's how they continue to push through these agendas.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.362]  With their media manipulation, doing things like that.
[00:16:52.622 --> 00:16:54.863]  He goes way more in depth, but I think that's a great example.
[00:16:54.883 --> 00:17:01.608]  I actually would recommend that book to a lot of people who are interested in getting into media so they can understand truly how the media operates.
[00:17:02.088 --> 00:17:04.310]  And now I bring you some very unfortunate news.
[00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:07.912]  It's another day and unfortunately another terror attack.
[00:17:08.013 --> 00:17:09.634]  We have a manhunt in Munich.
[00:17:10.307 --> 00:17:11.928]  After a shooting kills at least eight.
[00:17:12.648 --> 00:17:18.772]  A shooting at a shopping mall in Munich has left at least eight people dead and multiple people injured, the Munich police say.
[00:17:19.412 --> 00:17:25.976]  Police said that based on witness testimony, they were acting on the assumption that there were at least three attackers.
[00:17:26.636 --> 00:17:29.157]  They say they're describing it as an active shooting scene.
[00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.477]  It's not clear what motivated the attack.
[00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:36.299]  And of course, when you don't know who your shooters are, you don't know what their motivation is.
[00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:43.901]  It's a very scary thing, especially when you think about, you know, just go to a shopping mall, you're trying to live a normal, everyday life, and then you have to deal with...
[00:17:44.321 --> 00:17:45.442]  Stuff there, or any place you go.
[00:17:45.462 --> 00:17:46.563]  You go to school, any place else.
[00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:52.588]  But also, this follows the not-so-recent axe attack that we saw earlier this week.
[00:17:52.608 --> 00:17:57.371]  You know, some guy was on the train, he had his axe, he had a knife, you know, he's fighting with people, you know, chopped people up.
[00:17:57.412 --> 00:17:59.313]  Eventually, the cops caught him and shot him.
[00:17:59.333 --> 00:18:05.398]  But, man, it's just getting to the point where this is not just here in the U.S., because they always want to talk about here in the U.S.
[00:18:05.678 --> 00:18:11.703]  And of course, we have our issues here, but you also have things going on in France, and in Istanbul, or in Germany.
[00:18:12.163 --> 00:18:16.046]  As we see in the case here, and we'll bring you more information as it becomes available.
[00:18:16.426 --> 00:18:18.647]  And finally tonight, talking about Mrs. Clinton.
[00:18:18.788 --> 00:18:27.513]  Now, if you don't like Mrs. Clinton, you don't want to see Hillary for president, you may say you want to see Hillary for prison, and that's exactly what you can participate in.
[00:18:27.553 --> 00:18:35.719]  If you go to Florida National University tomorrow, and the hours are from 12 to 2, there's going to be flying around the Hillary for prison banners.
[00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:39.221]  And just let her know that she needs to be in prison.
[00:18:39.281 --> 00:18:41.463]  Also, I think there's still the bounty
[00:18:41.983 --> 00:18:42.563]  To call it out.
[00:18:42.824 --> 00:18:48.147]  If you can get Hillary to autograph your shirt, myself and Rob Dew will both send you $100 each.
[00:18:48.167 --> 00:18:50.348]  So go out there, go forth and prosper.
[00:18:50.388 --> 00:18:51.309]  That's it for this segment.
[00:18:51.969 --> 00:18:54.110]  Stay tuned after this break for more special reports.
[00:19:01.254 --> 00:19:02.795]  Hillary for prison shirts are $19.95.
[00:19:02.915 --> 00:19:04.777]  We've been selling them as low as $5.
[00:19:04.897 --> 00:19:06.378]  I want to get tens of thousands of them out there.
[00:19:06.398 --> 00:19:08.319]  There's like 80,000 of them now out there or something.
[00:19:09.189 --> 00:19:10.170]  They're all over the country.
[00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.431]  It's one of the top memes in the nation.
[00:19:11.691 --> 00:19:15.693]  But at $19.95, we can take all the proceeds and pay for aircraft from the skies.
[00:19:15.974 --> 00:19:17.375]  You've seen that be national news.
[00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:18.996]  You've seen that be the top meme in the country.
[00:19:19.036 --> 00:19:19.516]  It's amazing.
[00:19:20.056 --> 00:19:21.938]  We're leading the way on how to resist.
[00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:23.459]  We're ragtag.
[00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:25.580]  We're cross-eyed and exhausted half the time.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.841]  But we've got the passion.
[00:19:26.861 --> 00:19:27.722]  We're going over the top.
[00:19:28.122 --> 00:19:30.944]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:19:31.184 --> 00:19:38.948]  I'm selling at $19.95 to pay for the banners, to pay for the 18-wheelers with the big signs, to pay for the Jumbotron videos, and it's really paying off.
[00:19:38.968 --> 00:19:40.969]  Hundreds of newspapers, TV, Hillary for President.
[00:19:41.569 --> 00:19:45.131]  You cannot, but all the shirts we sell, all the ones we have, it's like $60,000.
[00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:47.752]  So, but we got more being printed right now.
[00:19:47.792 --> 00:19:55.756]  Everybody's got to go buy a Hillary for President shirt for $19.95, show that in full or so you can get on the whole, because I want to really go crazy with airplanes at the DNC.
[00:19:56.096 --> 00:19:57.257]  We're looking at blimps as well.
[00:19:57.677 --> 00:19:58.578]  We're not going to be censored.
[00:19:58.659 --> 00:19:59.820]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.322]  Get your Hillary for President shirts today.
[00:20:01.683 --> 00:20:03.886]  Look in the last eight months how far that meme's come.
[00:20:04.167 --> 00:20:08.293]  In one block that I walked just a minute ago, I saw 15 of those shirts.
[00:20:08.713 --> 00:20:09.735]  Just in one block!
[00:20:10.256 --> 00:20:12.659]  They drive here from my spot where I'm staying.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.001]  30, 40 tons of them.
[00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:17.383]  They're every single winner.
[00:20:17.403 --> 00:20:22.326]  The rally yesterday, almost everyone in the crowd had on a Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:20:22.486 --> 00:20:23.647]  It is amazing.
[00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:27.049]  Everyone stops and they go, what does that shirt mean?
[00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:27.409]  Why?
[00:20:27.489 --> 00:20:28.830]  Why does she need to go to prison?
[00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:35.314]  And it allows us to engage in a conversation and teach these people who have no clue about who Hillary really is.
[00:20:35.874 --> 00:20:37.596]  About all the things she's been involved in.
[00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:38.857]  And we're not laying down to that witch.
[00:20:38.897 --> 00:20:40.418]  She's not, she's not going to buffalo us.
[00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:41.419]  We're not coward.
[00:20:41.439 --> 00:20:42.220]  We're not broke back.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.981]  We're taking action.
[00:20:43.001 --> 00:20:43.501]  What about you?
[00:20:43.802 --> 00:20:44.722]  Get your Hillary for President shirt.
[00:20:44.762 --> 00:20:45.483]  I know you already have one.
[00:20:45.503 --> 00:20:45.944]  Buy another one.
[00:20:46.184 --> 00:20:47.125]  Give it to friends and family.
[00:20:47.465 --> 00:20:50.248]  I'm telling you, the war is now, the war is an info war.
[00:20:50.488 --> 00:20:51.068]  We're going to win.
[00:20:51.569 --> 00:20:54.291]  It's now been duplicated by countless groups and I think that's wonderful.
[00:20:55.273 --> 00:21:02.196]  Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and now it's all over CNN, it's all over Fox, it's all over the Trump rallies, the Hillary rallies.
[00:21:02.556 --> 00:21:09.618]  The number one search term for a week straight, last week, and still continuing, one of the top search terms is, is Hillary going to jail?
[00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.059]  This has been incredibly successful.
[00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:16.701]  Because it shows, despite corporate control, and despite them trying to control the meme,
[00:21:17.341 --> 00:21:19.663]  We've had three versions of the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[00:21:20.183 --> 00:21:23.606]  All of them have been collector's edition and have helped fund the InfoWar.
[00:21:24.186 --> 00:21:26.748]  We now have a third edition in.
[00:21:26.989 --> 00:21:28.310]  The second edition sold out.
[00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:45.223]  It's the same as the last, but on the right shoulder says InfoWars.com, on the back it says InfoWars.com, legalized freedom, be part of history, be part of supporting the InfoWar, be part of meeting like-minded friends and family.
[00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:53.975]  Get your Hillary for Prison 2016 3rd Wave Shirts at InfoWarStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:01.394 --> 00:22:01.874]  Not a group.
[00:22:01.914 --> 00:22:03.314]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:22:03.354 --> 00:22:04.435]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:22:04.695 --> 00:22:05.615]  Why is this so good?
[00:22:05.895 --> 00:22:11.136]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:22:11.216 --> 00:22:24.780]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.200]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.581]  Spreading disease around.
[00:22:28.642 --> 00:22:31.124]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:32.485]  These are all parasites.
[00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:33.646]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:34.687]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:22:34.987 --> 00:22:39.330]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:22:39.531 --> 00:22:42.693]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:22:42.713 --> 00:22:45.876]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:22:45.916 --> 00:22:46.917]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:22:46.957 --> 00:22:47.477]  Living Defense.
[00:22:47.777 --> 00:22:48.838]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:48.898 --> 00:22:49.919]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:22:49.939 --> 00:22:51.961]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:22:53.522 --> 00:22:54.505]  You support the broadcast.
[00:22:54.565 --> 00:22:55.647]  Infowarslives.com.
[00:22:55.908 --> 00:22:57.812]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:22:58.173 --> 00:23:00.157]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:23:06.977 --> 00:23:08.738]  Hey, is that Charlie Rose?
[00:23:09.438 --> 00:23:10.578]  Hey, Alex Jones, how are you?
[00:23:10.598 --> 00:23:12.279]  Can you spend two minutes with us?
[00:23:12.319 --> 00:23:12.999]  Yes, two minutes.
[00:23:13.299 --> 00:23:17.001]  Well, I tell you, man, I tell you, you have... I love your roundtable discussions.
[00:23:17.061 --> 00:23:17.401]  Thank you.
[00:23:17.541 --> 00:23:18.301]  Those are so original.
[00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:19.222]  Thank you very much.
[00:23:19.762 --> 00:23:20.682]  It's fun to do it.
[00:23:21.142 --> 00:23:22.143]  Do you think Trump's going to win?
[00:23:22.463 --> 00:23:23.323]  I have no idea.
[00:23:23.683 --> 00:23:24.324]  What's your gut tell?
[00:23:24.344 --> 00:23:24.884]  You're a smart guy.
[00:23:25.084 --> 00:23:28.245]  Well, my gut tells me that he could make it into a very competitive race.
[00:23:28.845 --> 00:23:29.986]  How do you do two, three shows a day?
[00:23:30.006 --> 00:23:32.007]  I know you're one of the hardest working guys in radio and TV.
[00:23:32.047 --> 00:23:32.687]  I don't know how you do it.
[00:23:33.379 --> 00:23:33.999]  Hey, I love it.
[00:23:34.019 --> 00:23:34.940]  I'm passionate about it.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.381]  I take care of myself.
[00:23:36.821 --> 00:23:38.181]  I get several naps a day.
[00:23:38.542 --> 00:23:39.822]  I stay in shape.
[00:23:40.723 --> 00:23:42.023]  I love the work, and it overlaps.
[00:23:42.684 --> 00:23:46.826]  Look, I would interview Peter Thiel if you... I don't think people that go to Bilderberg are bad overall.
[00:23:46.846 --> 00:23:49.247]  I think some of the secret agendas and the shadow government are bad.
[00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:50.167]  Have you been to Bilderberg?
[00:23:50.327 --> 00:23:50.568]  Yes.
[00:23:51.488 --> 00:23:52.829]  And was it... Not in a while, though.
[00:23:52.969 --> 00:23:53.469]  Not in a while.
[00:23:53.989 --> 00:23:54.790]  I mean, is it overblown?
[00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:55.910]  I think so.
[00:23:57.671 --> 00:24:00.232]  Do you think it's just kind of something left over from kind of the Cold War?
[00:24:00.312 --> 00:24:01.093]  I don't know.
[00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:03.595]  Well, he's talking about Voldemort.
[00:24:03.615 --> 00:24:04.475]  It's no big deal.
[00:24:04.815 --> 00:24:06.176]  I mean, he's a big media guy.
[00:24:06.196 --> 00:24:06.917]  We love talking to him.
[00:24:07.057 --> 00:24:07.777]  Look at this big crowd here.
[00:24:07.797 --> 00:24:08.238]  You're a fan.
[00:24:08.338 --> 00:24:08.798]  Well, listen.
[00:24:09.458 --> 00:24:10.659]  Who are you supporting for president?
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.883]  First of all, I don't go out talking about who I support to you or to anyone else.
[00:24:17.363 --> 00:24:18.704]  I'm registered as an independent.
[00:24:19.204 --> 00:24:19.885]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:24:19.905 --> 00:24:21.566]  What do you think about U.S.-Russian relations?
[00:24:22.786 --> 00:24:24.047]  Depends on who you talk to, doesn't it?
[00:24:24.067 --> 00:24:25.968]  You talk to John Kerry.
[00:24:26.008 --> 00:24:28.290]  He's trying to get them to do something together.
[00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.311]  You talk to other people.
[00:24:30.331 --> 00:24:31.812]  They're worried.
[00:24:32.564 --> 00:24:37.248]  Uh, about what's going on in Syria, and they're worried about Putin.
[00:24:37.648 --> 00:24:39.410]  Exactly, why isn't it more congruent?
[00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.053]  Because usually in US policy, you'd hear kind of a policy, it's usually just a bunch of different policies.
[00:24:44.935 --> 00:24:48.197]  Well, I mean, the administration is trying to have a relationship.
[00:24:49.462 --> 00:24:54.268]  They're trying to have a relationship with Russia in order to do something about Syria.
[00:24:54.288 --> 00:24:57.733]  They need Russia because of their relationship with Assad.
[00:24:57.773 --> 00:25:00.196]  And Assad's gained some because of the Russian presence.
[00:25:00.777 --> 00:25:01.378]  It's stronger.
[00:25:01.398 --> 00:25:05.463]  Those 51 diplomats were complaining about the US not having enough leverage.
[00:25:06.064 --> 00:25:06.785]  Well, thanks for the time.
[00:25:06.805 --> 00:25:07.365]  I appreciate it.
[00:25:07.405 --> 00:25:08.086]  I like your style.
[00:25:08.206 --> 00:25:09.827]  Well, I appreciate not being too scared to talk to us.
[00:25:09.847 --> 00:25:10.408]  Most people would be.
[00:25:10.448 --> 00:25:10.788]  Thank you, sir.
[00:25:10.808 --> 00:25:11.108]  Thank you.
[00:25:11.288 --> 00:25:11.549]  Alright.
[00:25:11.569 --> 00:25:12.469]  Now, he was not a coward.
[00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.871]  He talked to us, and I appreciate that.
[00:25:14.171 --> 00:25:16.713]  Even though his staff freaked out like Dracula had just attacked.
[00:25:17.614 --> 00:25:18.314]  But, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:18.334 --> 00:25:18.755]  So we're nice.
[00:25:18.775 --> 00:25:19.455]  People are nice to us.
[00:25:19.515 --> 00:25:19.655]  Alright.
[00:25:19.696 --> 00:25:19.996]  There you go.
[00:25:20.316 --> 00:25:20.917]  InfoWars.com.
[00:25:29.565 --> 00:25:31.786]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:25:31.826 --> 00:25:35.227]  I'm in downtown Cleveland taking a look at the mass protest underway.
[00:25:35.587 --> 00:25:37.948]  I want to talk to these guys over here, find out what they're doing here.
[00:25:37.968 --> 00:25:41.189]  Okay.
[00:25:41.309 --> 00:25:42.310]  Do you guys want to talk to us?
[00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:43.390]  Get out of here with your crap.
[00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.251]  Why are you guys here?
[00:25:45.591 --> 00:25:46.491]  I'm not here with them.
[00:25:46.571 --> 00:25:47.512]  I'm not here with anybody.
[00:25:47.712 --> 00:25:47.932]  Go.
[00:25:49.092 --> 00:25:49.612]  Look at this.
[00:25:50.193 --> 00:25:50.413]  Hey.
[00:25:51.889 --> 00:25:52.869]  What are you guys doing here?
[00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:55.871]  We've got profanity.
[00:25:56.031 --> 00:25:58.112]  That's what we've got.
[00:25:58.232 --> 00:25:59.453]  This is a public space.
[00:25:59.473 --> 00:26:00.413]  It's a public space.
[00:26:00.433 --> 00:26:01.454]  That sounds like a no.
[00:26:01.554 --> 00:26:03.775]  There are kids here and they're cussing, profanity.
[00:26:03.795 --> 00:26:05.716]  I'm not offended by anybody.
[00:26:05.756 --> 00:26:07.056]  I said get the f**k out of here, mate.
[00:26:07.677 --> 00:26:08.817]  Hey bro, this is a public space.
[00:26:08.877 --> 00:26:09.738]  I'm not getting the f**k out of here.
[00:26:09.798 --> 00:26:10.998]  I'm not talking to you, mate.
[00:26:11.299 --> 00:26:12.039]  I'm talking to you.
[00:26:12.639 --> 00:26:13.820]  No, no, f**k you.
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.201]  I don't give a s**t if they want to talk to me.
[00:26:16.361 --> 00:26:17.962]  Seriously, they just said they didn't want to talk.
[00:26:18.382 --> 00:26:20.203]  We just want to know who they are and who they're with.
[00:26:20.264 --> 00:26:22.906]  We just want to know who they're with, that's all.
[00:26:22.926 --> 00:26:24.527]  Like, what their platform is.
[00:26:24.547 --> 00:26:24.987]  No we don't!
[00:26:25.007 --> 00:26:26.208]  I'm interested in the flag, frankly.
[00:26:34.995 --> 00:26:42.179]  You know, kid, I don't think they want to talk to us, but honestly, listening to their grievances, I'm trying to figure out who they are, what they're with.
[00:26:42.219 --> 00:26:48.483]  Very hostile, very profane group, and just got cussed out for just wanting to ask them a simple question, what they're doing here.
[00:26:48.823 --> 00:26:55.007]  I heard them tell the police officers that they don't feel safe, that these guys don't feel safe, the guys with the masks on.
[00:26:57.628 --> 00:26:59.490]  Those people don't know what that flag represents, bro.
[00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:01.291]  30 people only know what the flag means?
[00:27:01.311 --> 00:27:05.013]  They can go on YouTube and hit millions of people, but they don't even know.
[00:27:14.525 --> 00:27:15.166]  Seriously?
[00:27:15.186 --> 00:27:15.446]  Okay.
[00:27:29.602 --> 00:27:30.622]  I appreciate you talking to us.
[00:27:30.662 --> 00:27:32.843]  We're just trying to figure out who they are.
[00:27:32.863 --> 00:27:34.383]  They're targeted by the state.
[00:27:34.403 --> 00:27:35.923]  They're targeted by other racist groups.
[00:27:35.983 --> 00:27:38.024]  They're targeted by the state and racist groups?
[00:27:38.044 --> 00:27:38.464]  Which ones?
[00:27:57.984 --> 00:28:01.349]  Like, I mean, racist groups like the KKK.
[00:28:03.011 --> 00:28:03.251]  Yes.
[00:28:03.852 --> 00:28:04.253]  Are you kidding?
[00:28:04.273 --> 00:28:09.820]  You guys, you guys don't see it because you're not on the street level, but there's like going on.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.002]  I'm on the street every day.
[00:28:11.022 --> 00:28:11.483]  I'm sure.
[00:28:15.035 --> 00:28:16.356]  It's getting pretty hostile here.
[00:28:16.376 --> 00:28:17.817]  There's a fight that's about to break out.
[00:28:17.838 --> 00:28:19.139]  I think we should move for our own safety.
[00:28:25.144 --> 00:28:28.727]  You know, we're trying to figure out what the heck they want, what they're doing here.
[00:28:29.087 --> 00:28:34.752]  They said that they were targeted by racist groups, which is why they have to cover their faces.
[00:28:35.713 --> 00:28:38.215]  I'm not really sure which racist group they're talking about.
[00:28:41.823 --> 00:28:43.986]  Hey Joe, did you catch the people in the mask?
[00:28:44.426 --> 00:28:44.847]  What's going on?
[00:28:44.867 --> 00:28:45.668]  They wouldn't talk to us.
[00:28:45.928 --> 00:28:47.290]  They actually bumped us away.
[00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.132]  That's what they always do.
[00:28:49.513 --> 00:28:51.676]  This one's going to be the new meme though.
[00:29:00.077 --> 00:29:07.803]  I think the rally was a huge success in defiance of those that wanted to censor our free speech and who tried to intimidate people from speaking.
[00:29:08.263 --> 00:29:09.404]  It's part of a systematic program.
[00:29:09.424 --> 00:29:13.607]  We've seen a censorship not just in cyberspace but physically on the ground.
[00:29:14.188 --> 00:29:27.638]  Obama had our airplanes that were towing banners the last few days banned and had the biggest restriction on airspace in the history of a convention done for the full convention here and in Philadelphia in direct response to our legal and lawful company
[00:29:28.639 --> 00:29:29.880]  Flying around with Hillary for President 2016.
[00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:31.442]  What do you think about the rally?
[00:29:31.482 --> 00:29:32.483]  I mean, was it a success?
[00:29:33.344 --> 00:29:33.624]  Roger?
[00:29:33.944 --> 00:29:35.346]  Yeah, I think it was a massive success.
[00:29:35.366 --> 00:29:37.368]  Look, this was the suppression.
[00:29:37.508 --> 00:29:39.030]  They want to suppress our free speech.
[00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:40.531]  Because it endangers them.
[00:29:40.592 --> 00:29:41.913]  The truth is what they fear.
[00:29:42.333 --> 00:29:43.735]  And they know we're carrying the truth.
[00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:46.478]  So as Alex said, it's not just Facebook, it's not just
[00:29:46.878 --> 00:29:54.242]  Twitter, it's not just cyberspace, but in the villages and towns and communities, they want to suppress our ability to tell the truth.
[00:29:55.203 --> 00:30:03.347]  And I'm particularly grateful to the ACLU who represented us in court, and to the federal judge who had the courage in a corrupted system
[00:30:03.687 --> 00:30:11.352]  To strike down the gag order of the Democratic machine of Cleveland and to order the city to give us a permit so that we could have our rally.
[00:30:11.412 --> 00:30:15.976]  Now, the Westboro Baptist Church had no trouble getting a permit because they thought that would embarrass us.
[00:30:16.396 --> 00:30:22.520]  And Black Lives Matter had no problem getting a permit, and MoveOn had no problem getting a permit.
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:29.365]  It was only liberty-minded Americans who wanted to protest, or I should say celebrate in this case, the nomination
[00:30:29.705 --> 00:30:30.866]  That's another important question.
[00:30:30.886 --> 00:30:33.788]  I want to get to some of you guys' questions, but let me ask you this.
[00:30:34.169 --> 00:30:37.812]  Trump clearly is starting to come ahead of Hillary in many polls, battleground states.
[00:30:37.832 --> 00:30:38.792]  We've already talked about that.
[00:30:51.829 --> 00:30:53.229]  How will they strike back?
[00:30:53.369 --> 00:30:55.830]  What do you expect him to do at the end of this convention?
[00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.290]  When I know you told me you expect Trump to be even more ahead.
[00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:03.151]  Yeah, I think Trump takes the lead in this race after the convention.
[00:31:04.031 --> 00:31:08.372]  I have enormous faith in Paul Manafort and Tony Fabrizio and Jason Miller.
[00:31:08.392 --> 00:31:09.973]  These guys are political pros.
[00:31:10.493 --> 00:31:11.793]  They have bonded with Trump.
[00:31:11.913 --> 00:31:16.294]  We now have a cohesive campaign in which everybody's pulling in the same direction.
[00:31:16.454 --> 00:31:21.595]  And I'm absolutely convinced in Mike Pence we have the best possible running mate of the choices available.
[00:31:22.035 --> 00:31:26.899]  And that he is going to be a perfect balance for Trump out in the Republican states and in the base states, so yes.
[00:31:27.459 --> 00:31:31.843]  What I think happens here is that Trump, the Trump-Pence ticket is going to pull ahead.
[00:31:31.943 --> 00:31:37.347]  That's in the face of an unfair mainstream media that spends all day trashing the Trump-Pence ticket.
[00:31:37.667 --> 00:31:41.089]  It's in the face of a country where there are more Democrats than Republicans.
[00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.791]  You know what you're going to see from the Clintons?
[00:31:43.291 --> 00:31:43.691]  Panic.
[00:31:44.012 --> 00:31:46.033]  And that's when they try to bring down the police state.
[00:31:46.313 --> 00:31:50.817]  That's when they try to shut down your rallies and they start playing games with the voting process.
[00:31:51.357 --> 00:31:56.360]  The single biggest danger out there, I believe, is voter theft, is voter fraud.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.562]  We saw it to some degree in the primaries.
[00:32:00.282 --> 00:32:04.045]  The machines are going to be working overtime voting people who are dead.
[00:32:04.285 --> 00:32:05.906]  A great tradition in Texas, as you know.
[00:32:05.926 --> 00:32:07.767]  They're going to be voting people that don't exist.
[00:32:07.787 --> 00:32:10.729]  They're going to be voting people who are not qualified to vote.
[00:32:10.749 --> 00:32:12.610]  They're going to be voting people multiple times.
[00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:17.434]  That, I think, is the danger because the established order is petrified.
[00:32:17.954 --> 00:32:19.035]  Trump can't be bullied.
[00:32:19.335 --> 00:32:20.296]  He can't be bought.
[00:32:20.376 --> 00:32:23.979]  They see a wave of reform unlike anything they've ever seen.
[00:32:24.639 --> 00:32:26.461]  And they're scared sh**less.
[00:32:27.061 --> 00:32:32.806]  Alex, what role do you think that you and Roger have played in the rise and success of Donald Trump this election cycle?
[00:32:33.436 --> 00:32:41.979]  I think we're all just together as populists and basically have just been out promoting what we've been promoting for a long time.
[00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:43.079]  And Trump's just doing that as well.
[00:32:43.539 --> 00:32:45.900]  So I just see us all working together in synergy.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:58.664]  But I have seen Roger particularly and myself and others, Drudge, Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, I guess a lot of the credit as well, to counter lies of the establishment media faster than Trump's people were doing earlier.
[00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:07.990]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.031]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.431 --> 00:33:12.493]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.174 --> 00:33:13.634]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:16.436]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.736 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.

[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.690]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.031 --> 00:36:46.696]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.896 --> 00:36:53.022]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.

[00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:09.367]  Liam McAdoo with InfoWars.com.
[00:37:09.407 --> 00:37:12.370]  We're here in Cleveland covering the Republican National Convention.
[00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.652]  I am seated next to Captain Clay Higgins.
[00:37:14.672 --> 00:37:17.835]  Now you just got done doing an interview with the Alex Jones Show.
[00:37:17.875 --> 00:37:18.835]  A really great interview.
[00:37:19.196 --> 00:37:21.538]  And now I wanted to get the chance to sit down and talk with you.
[00:37:21.958 --> 00:37:22.638]  A little bit, of course.
[00:37:23.018 --> 00:37:26.819]  You might recognize this guy from those viral Crimestopper videos.
[00:37:26.859 --> 00:37:33.321]  You put your parish kind of on the map with that, able to really round up a lot of criminals with those viral videos.
[00:37:33.861 --> 00:37:35.282]  Tell us a little bit about that strategy.
[00:37:36.522 --> 00:37:39.003]  Well, you know, I threw away the script.
[00:37:39.183 --> 00:37:39.943]  That's my nature.
[00:37:40.163 --> 00:37:48.746]  When I was asked to fulfill that duty position, I've been a street cop for now for 12, 13 years, and in November of 2014, my sheriff
[00:37:50.552 --> 00:37:52.534]  Asked me to be his public information officer.
[00:37:52.554 --> 00:37:59.980]  A small part of that job was performing a public service announcement called Crime Stoppers once a week.
[00:38:00.801 --> 00:38:06.226]  And you know, my nature is to speak candidly and from my heart, so I did so.
[00:38:06.466 --> 00:38:10.590]  I researched the crime and then addressed the nature of the crime.
[00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:15.394]  What did it really mean about our country that such a thing could even happen?
[00:38:16.275 --> 00:38:22.836]  And, you know, the pain of the victim, the invasion of the victim's home.
[00:38:24.376 --> 00:38:26.077]  These are not just numbers on a report.
[00:38:26.097 --> 00:38:26.717]  These are people.
[00:38:26.757 --> 00:38:30.737]  These are our fellow Americans who have been injured, hurt, damaged in some way.
[00:38:31.338 --> 00:38:37.699]  And I always address the suspect as a fellow American, fellow child of God.
[00:38:38.359 --> 00:38:41.659]  You know, failed and fallen, yes, but aren't we all in some way?
[00:38:42.379 --> 00:38:45.260]  And I believe in the redemptive nature of every human being.
[00:38:46.229 --> 00:39:05.240]  Although I expected to hold the suspect accountable for his actions, I also believed in him as a man and in his ability to accept responsibility and move forward towards, you know, a redeemed life, you know, within his own soul and within his own heart.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.682]  And somehow I was able to communicate that through the camera.
[00:39:09.202 --> 00:39:12.064]  And it did touch people's minds and hearts and souls.
[00:39:12.805 --> 00:39:27.736]  And during the course of the time that I was the public information officer for the sheriff, 19, 19 felons, 18 men and one woman presented themselves peacefully to the sheriff's office and turned themselves in.
[00:39:27.756 --> 00:39:28.757]  That's unprecedented.
[00:39:29.717 --> 00:39:39.905]  Um, and then when we did the gremlins video, which was my final Crime Stoppers video, that's the one that, uh, that there was somewhat of an uproar.
[00:39:40.974 --> 00:39:51.617]  And because I found myself principally opposed to the commands I was given by my sheriff, I had to resign as a matter of principle.
[00:39:51.637 --> 00:39:54.438]  I became sort of a conscientious objector, you understand?
[00:39:55.058 --> 00:40:05.241]  I'll follow any order, but if it's contrary to my deep conscience, then of course I'm bound by higher law to step down, which I did.
[00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:13.093]  Since then, of the seven gremlins that we were looking for, these were some hyper-violent guys, man.
[00:40:13.254 --> 00:40:15.315]  They were out there doing wrong.
[00:40:16.876 --> 00:40:24.099]  Since then, within a few weeks, three of them turned themselves in, and then over the course of the last eight months or so, the other four have been captured.
[00:40:24.179 --> 00:40:33.264]  So, yes ma'am, we were very successful with the Crime Stoppers videos, and you know what, that door closed and God opened another one.
[00:40:33.464 --> 00:40:34.225]  So that's where I am now.
[00:40:34.687 --> 00:40:36.889]  Well, I actually saw that Gremlins video.
[00:40:36.969 --> 00:40:38.590]  It was pretty badass.
[00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.732]  That was why I was like, we've got to get this guy on the show.
[00:40:40.792 --> 00:40:41.973]  That was so wonderful.
[00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:44.215]  But of course, you did talk a little tough in it.
[00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:47.158]  And some people were a little offended.
[00:40:47.198 --> 00:40:48.759]  They said that was a little too tough.
[00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:54.003]  How dare you speak to these hyper-violent criminals in a derogatory way?
[00:40:54.364 --> 00:40:55.685]  How did you feel about that?
[00:40:56.486 --> 00:40:57.947]  Well, you know, you anticipate that.
[00:40:58.507 --> 00:41:00.329]  You know, street talk is tough talk.
[00:41:01.152 --> 00:41:05.254]  And if you're a street cop talking to street criminals, then you use street language.
[00:41:05.674 --> 00:41:07.395]  And that's just reality, man.
[00:41:08.155 --> 00:41:14.939]  We live in a society now that's very protected, shall we say.
[00:41:15.279 --> 00:41:20.221]  Insulated from the horrors of the street, by and large.
[00:41:20.461 --> 00:41:21.982]  So you get this politically correct
[00:41:22.543 --> 00:41:28.905]  You know, crap from the world about, you know, please don't hurt anybody's feelings, you know, while they're shooting families in the head.
[00:41:29.205 --> 00:41:33.467]  You know, this is, this is, this is the nature of the country we live in now.
[00:41:33.647 --> 00:41:34.947]  I just don't participate in it.
[00:41:35.487 --> 00:41:37.188]  I will not participate in gossip.
[00:41:37.348 --> 00:41:39.789]  It's the cheapest form of human communication.
[00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:44.270]  And I will not participate in political correctness because it's a, it's a venom, man.
[00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.291]  It's a cancer that's destroying our country.
[00:41:46.631 --> 00:41:49.672]  This is the, we, we live in the United States of America.
[00:41:49.692 --> 00:41:51.833]  Our first amendment guarantees our free speech.
[00:41:52.353 --> 00:41:56.734]  This is, of course, the foundation of our freedoms.
[00:41:56.854 --> 00:41:59.575]  It's a cornerstone of who we are and what we are.
[00:41:59.735 --> 00:42:12.779]  And yet, we've allowed insidious forces to impose upon us the restriction of our speech and the restriction of our emotions in some manner as if they're right and we're wrong.
[00:42:12.799 --> 00:42:17.340]  Well, listen, every one of my fellow Americans, regardless of ideology,
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:22.424]  Color, creed, political affiliation, social background, ethnicity.
[00:42:22.744 --> 00:42:30.391]  We all have earned the right by the blood that's been shed by patriots, by the heritage of our family.
[00:42:30.871 --> 00:42:35.315]  Every single one of our families has woven the thread of our flag.
[00:42:37.096 --> 00:42:42.721]  We stand in the shade of the glory of that one flag that's been woven by an entire nation
[00:42:43.041 --> 00:42:43.161]  Right.
[00:42:43.241 --> 00:42:43.461]  Right.
[00:42:59.491 --> 00:43:05.274]  Well, the nation is obviously ready for brave people to stand up and speak out like that.
[00:43:06.174 --> 00:43:14.919]  Now, speaking of tough talk, what did you think about Obama's response to all of these fallen officers getting shot in the street in Obama's America?
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:21.102]  As a constitutionalist, I have deep respect for the position of Commander-in-Chief.
[00:43:21.842 --> 00:43:28.065]  You'll rarely find me saying a disparaging word in private or public about the man that holds that office.
[00:43:29.631 --> 00:43:46.023]  I've been continually disappointed in the message and the rhetoric that has come out of my White House, because that White House doesn't belong to President Obama, nor did it belong to President Bush, nor any before them.
[00:43:46.463 --> 00:43:49.645]  It belongs to the American people, and those in D.C.
[00:43:49.685 --> 00:43:50.406]  in the Beltway
[00:43:50.762 --> 00:43:58.549]  The career politicians that have seized power in Washington need to hear Lima Charlie, that the people are about to take this country back.
[00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:02.092]  So you ask me how I feel about some of the things he said, ma'am?
[00:44:02.532 --> 00:44:04.253]  It would require me to say ugly things.
[00:44:04.394 --> 00:44:06.295]  I'm just not going to say that about my president.
[00:44:07.436 --> 00:44:10.379]  I have been, to my heart and soul, very disappointed.
[00:44:11.572 --> 00:44:24.868]  Just at the time when he had such an opportunity for leadership, man, from his unique position as our first African-American president, he really, really could have made things better, but that certainly hasn't happened, has it?
[00:44:25.769 --> 00:44:30.455]  And obviously taking that opportunity to push for more gun control, where do you stand on that?
[00:44:32.185 --> 00:44:37.469]  Well, our Second Amendment clearly defines, you know, gun control.
[00:44:37.749 --> 00:44:42.472]  Listen, it wasn't even until the 60s that guns were regulated at all.
[00:44:43.192 --> 00:44:49.496]  In the 50s, a child, any child could buy a gun from any seller if daddy sent him with the money.
[00:44:50.117 --> 00:44:53.159]  It wasn't until the 60s we even had serial numbers mandated
[00:44:53.806 --> 00:44:54.747]  on on guns.
[00:44:54.848 --> 00:44:58.452]  I grew up in the 70s, went to a large rural high school.
[00:44:59.093 --> 00:45:09.848]  Every vehicle in the parking lot mostly on teachers and students side was a pickup truck and most every vehicle had a rifle or shotgun be in the back glass and nobody got shot.
[00:45:10.379 --> 00:45:19.363]  You know, the availability of guns in our country has been more restricted over the last several decades, where you're starting to see these mass shootings and whatnot.
[00:45:19.763 --> 00:45:21.804]  So you have to ask yourself, what's going on, man?
[00:45:21.864 --> 00:45:23.225]  It's a breakdown of the family.
[00:45:23.245 --> 00:45:24.666]  It's a breakdown of our culture.
[00:45:25.246 --> 00:45:32.109]  And personally, I think it's our national shame of how we address mental illness in our country.
[00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:34.190]  We have a history of failure in that.
[00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:36.471]  Now, I don't know of any country that handles it right.
[00:45:36.571 --> 00:45:37.852]  I'm just talking about America.
[00:45:38.882 --> 00:45:44.847]  And, you know, you always look into the background of these mass shooters, and those are the guys pulling the triggers.
[00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:45.968]  I mean, look at their history.
[00:45:46.308 --> 00:45:54.135]  There's always some kind of mental, you know, challenge that they face that's been handled with mostly with pharmaceutical drugs.
[00:45:54.755 --> 00:45:56.216]  Christ knows what's in that stuff.
[00:45:57.297 --> 00:46:02.141]  And I just don't think that restriction of gun rights and
[00:46:02.722 --> 00:46:06.505]  Ownership rights for guns or restriction of the type of guns that we have.
[00:46:06.785 --> 00:46:09.847]  We already have many, many restrictions.
[00:46:09.887 --> 00:46:12.850]  You know, we are certainly well regulated, are we not?
[00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:16.192]  I mean, people talk about military weapons.
[00:46:16.532 --> 00:46:22.837]  You know, American civilians can't own tanks and we can't own calibers over .50 caliber.
[00:46:24.298 --> 00:46:35.250]  You know, in order to own an automatic weapon, where by that I mean you pull the trigger one time and more than one bullet comes out, you have to pay for a very expensive license.
[00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:38.093]  It's an extensive background check, takes months.
[00:46:38.473 --> 00:46:44.379]  And then you have to maintain that license, which is expensive every year, which is why very few Americans have that.
[00:46:44.419 --> 00:46:46.742]  So we're already heavily restricted
[00:46:48.384 --> 00:46:51.428]  The shootings that we're looking at right now are not because of guns.
[00:46:51.789 --> 00:46:58.458]  It's because of the people holding them and perhaps of a systematic failure in our nation to deal with mental illness.
[00:46:58.698 --> 00:46:59.720]  That's where I stand on that.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.725]  I don't know.
[00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:10.971]  Here we have Alex on media row at the RNC.
[00:49:11.192 --> 00:49:21.456]  Alex reaches the Young Turks YouTube booth and is instantly met by a group of disheartened, arrogant anchors, harboring a clear loathing of all things Alex Jones.
[00:49:22.237 --> 00:49:26.039]  Alex Jones is right about a few things, so about the NSA spying, etc.
[00:49:27.119 --> 00:49:28.740]  He was right about that, we were right about that.
[00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:33.042]  The problem with Alex isn't what he starts out with, it's where he ends up.
[00:49:33.602 --> 00:49:40.511]  Okay, he'll take some things that are true, and then next, you know, by the end of the conversation, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds are killing everybody.
[00:49:41.886 --> 00:49:42.146]  What?
[00:49:43.307 --> 00:49:46.989]  And then the lizard people take off their masks and they go, whoa!
[00:49:47.629 --> 00:49:51.111]  And so there's some goodness to Alex Jones, no question about it.
[00:49:51.211 --> 00:49:52.771]  And a lot of things that I appreciate.
[00:49:53.392 --> 00:49:57.233]  But we got, one of our listeners sent us a clip where he's going ballistic, he's going crazy, right?
[00:49:57.474 --> 00:49:58.314]  How are you guys doing?
[00:49:59.254 --> 00:50:00.075]  We're doing okay.
[00:50:00.095 --> 00:50:02.016]  You like all our Hillary for Prisoners shirts everywhere?
[00:50:02.596 --> 00:50:03.797]  No, I kind of despise it.
[00:50:08.109 --> 00:50:13.394]  Young Turks anchor Jimmy Dore appears to announce the attack that is about to transpire.
[00:50:13.454 --> 00:50:14.795]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:50:16.156 --> 00:50:18.338]  Oh my God, Alex!
[00:50:18.418 --> 00:50:23.343]  Finally, Cenk Uygur, the main host of the Young Turks, loses it.
[00:50:23.563 --> 00:50:26.205]  Alright, you want to take my show over?
[00:50:26.245 --> 00:50:27.246]  I'll take your show over.
[00:50:27.627 --> 00:50:29.588]  Okay, you know who does this kind of shirt?
[00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:30.809]  First of all, sick guy.
[00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:31.750]  Second of all...
[00:50:33.692 --> 00:50:46.143]  Chaos ensues as Cenk is triggered by a Bill Clinton t-shirt with the word rape on it, and then the Young Turks host proceeds to unleash his vitriol for all things Republican on Roger Stone.
[00:50:46.403 --> 00:50:48.806]  You're a sick dude, Roger Stone!
[00:50:48.846 --> 00:50:51.868]  You assault me all the time, you never give me a chance to respond!
[00:50:51.928 --> 00:50:55.151]  I should give you a hatchet job to respond!
[00:50:55.231 --> 00:50:56.973]  You're a sick man, Roger Stone!
[00:50:57.713 --> 00:50:59.655]  No, you're the world's biggest liar!
[00:50:59.755 --> 00:51:02.557]  Didn't you admit that you lied about Ellie Smith, sir?
[00:51:02.737 --> 00:51:05.799]  Didn't you already admit that, you piece of crap?
[00:51:05.839 --> 00:51:09.442]  You piece of... First of all, Alex, this ain't your f***ing show, okay?
[00:51:09.662 --> 00:51:11.983]  And Roger, it certainly ain't your f***ing show!
[00:51:12.003 --> 00:51:12.804]  Afraid to debate him?
[00:51:13.224 --> 00:51:13.825]  Afraid?
[00:51:13.845 --> 00:51:14.665]  Are you kidding me?
[00:51:14.885 --> 00:51:15.486]  No, no, no, no!
[00:51:15.526 --> 00:51:16.306]  Bring it back on!
[00:51:16.367 --> 00:51:17.067]  Bring it back on!
[00:51:17.087 --> 00:51:18.288]  Who the f*** are you?
[00:51:18.608 --> 00:51:19.529]  Bring it back on!
[00:51:20.029 --> 00:51:26.951]  Anna Kasparian even blurts out fat shaming insults at Alex as Alex is swarmed by the Young Turks crew.
[00:51:38.435 --> 00:51:48.678]  Paul Joseph Watson writes, Towards the end of the confrontation, Anna Kasparian is caught on tape yelling at Alex Jones, Get off the stage, you fat b****.
[00:51:48.838 --> 00:52:01.441]  Aside from the fact that Jones is virtually the same size as Kasparian's boss, Cenk, her insult completely contradicts her previous conviction that people should not be shamed over their weight.
[00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:09.310]  I can relate to it big time, because when I was about four years old, my dance instructor told me that I was overweight.
[00:52:09.951 --> 00:52:11.313]  And as a four?
[00:52:11.353 --> 00:52:11.713]  Yes!
[00:52:11.994 --> 00:52:13.816]  And that stayed with me for the rest of my life.
[00:52:13.856 --> 00:52:17.541]  Now, I don't fit the results of the study.
[00:52:17.781 --> 00:52:19.203]  I'm not an unhealthy body weight.
[00:52:19.243 --> 00:52:20.204]  At least, I don't think I am.
[00:52:20.664 --> 00:52:26.691]  But, you know, it does scar you and you have issues with food and eating for the rest of your life.
[00:52:26.711 --> 00:52:29.253]  First of all, let me explain something, alright?
[00:52:29.273 --> 00:52:30.795]  Guys, can you f***ing sit?
[00:52:30.875 --> 00:52:32.337]  Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:52:32.397 --> 00:52:34.459]  We're against Saudi Arabia, you dumbass!
[00:52:34.719 --> 00:52:36.201]  We talk about that all the time!
[00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:36.701]  Oh, really?
[00:52:36.721 --> 00:52:37.983]  We talk about that all the time!
[00:52:38.003 --> 00:52:38.663]  You don't do s***!
[00:52:39.364 --> 00:52:40.986]  What do you think, the lizard people are in charge?
[00:52:41.006 --> 00:52:41.046]  No.
[00:52:41.126 --> 00:52:41.986]  Is that what you think?
[00:52:42.027 --> 00:52:43.608]  Hey, you're pissed because we're kicking your ass.
[00:52:43.668 --> 00:52:44.409]  Is that what you think?
[00:52:44.429 --> 00:52:45.810]  You're the anti-liberal and you're pissed.
[00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:47.411]  Bulls**t, I'm being nice here.
[00:52:47.431 --> 00:52:49.393]  You know what I care about?
[00:52:49.553 --> 00:52:50.955]  I care about the American people.
[00:52:50.975 --> 00:52:51.275]  Good.
[00:52:51.295 --> 00:52:52.196]  You're the one clubbing hell.
[00:52:52.216 --> 00:52:53.056]  Anybody hurt, I'm being nice.
[00:52:54.818 --> 00:53:10.708]  Young Turks anchor Jimmy Dore on the left takes a drink and like a frenzied llama proceeds to spit in Alex's face and then shrinks back into the fray giggling and celebrating his own lack of any semblance of manhood.
[00:53:16.751 --> 00:53:17.412]  Unbelievable!
[00:53:17.432 --> 00:53:22.059]  Immediately following the assault on Alex...
[00:53:32.893 --> 00:53:41.083]  Within roughly 30 minutes, all uploaded videos following the Young Turks debacle on the Alex Jones YouTube channel were shut down.
[00:53:41.363 --> 00:53:47.911]  And then the Young Turks crew immediately went on the defensive, belittling Infowars and Alex Jones.
[00:53:48.504 --> 00:53:50.947]  So Alex Jones comes here, in the beginning I wasn't mad at all.
[00:53:51.167 --> 00:53:55.453]  Okay, he's doing his grandstanding, and he's doing it because we have a much larger audience.
[00:53:55.533 --> 00:54:03.102]  So if he's containing his tiny, tiny audience, well then he has more trouble reaching a broader section of Americans.
[00:54:03.783 --> 00:54:11.546]  I cannot handle someone exploiting our show, capitalizing on our show, just to get eyeballs on him.
[00:54:11.926 --> 00:54:15.867]  That's why he's a pathetic show that he has to come on to larger shows to get this audience.
[00:54:16.167 --> 00:54:21.809]  This was media row at the RNC, hardly a controlled set at a media headquarters.
[00:54:22.109 --> 00:54:32.593]  The entire circus could have been avoided had the Young Turks crew had the equanimity and been even moderately professional and politely gotten to the bottom of and managed
[00:54:32.773 --> 00:54:33.393]  We're good to go!
[00:54:33.453 --> 00:54:34.193]  We're good to go!
[00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:25.917]  We're joined by a regular guest, although she hasn't been on for a while, Syrian girl who is a geopolitical analyst and contributor for the New Eastern Outlook because of course we had this horrific video that came out a couple of days ago.
[00:55:27.042 --> 00:55:38.288]  Which I actually watched in full, I wouldn't recommend anyone to do the same, where this young boy was beheaded by this rebel group backed by the Obama administration.
[00:55:38.648 --> 00:55:45.631]  It looked like this would have consequences for the US's involvement in Syria, but whether that's true or not remains to be seen.
[00:55:45.691 --> 00:55:46.932]  Syrian girl, welcome to the show.
[00:55:46.952 --> 00:55:50.454]  Hi, I'm glad to be back here, it's been a while.
[00:55:51.684 --> 00:55:55.188]  It's been a while, but we've had this big news again in Syria this week.
[00:55:55.248 --> 00:55:57.451]  It's really come back into focus.
[00:55:57.851 --> 00:56:09.285]  Before we get into the aftermath of, you know, how the media is twisting the narrative on this beheading, just walk us through this tragic sequence of events that led to the murder of this young boy in Aleppo.
[00:56:13.055 --> 00:56:25.739]  I commiserate with you because I also watched the horrifying video of this child getting beheaded and also laughed at by one of the CIA's moderate vetted rebels.
[00:56:26.419 --> 00:56:39.363]  And the sequence goes really back to 2011 and 2012, when many governments, not just the US government, but also NATO European governments, including France,
[00:56:39.963 --> 00:56:40.023]  Yes.
[00:56:55.464 --> 00:57:00.006]  did this beheading was CIA trained.
[00:57:00.586 --> 00:57:12.412]  And in March of 2015, the NATO run media was complaining that Russia was bombing this CIA trained, vetted, moderate rebel group.
[00:57:13.032 --> 00:57:21.237]  And the most interesting thing, you know, in these last three years is that they've been telling us that there's moderates and there's terrorists.
[00:57:21.397 --> 00:57:25.739]  There's the moderate rebels that they're arming that are vetted and very nice.
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:36.045]  And then there's the terrible, terrible ISIS and Al-Qaeda, which every single massacre, though, of course, ISIS and Al-Qaeda commit numerous massacres and acts of terrorism.
[00:57:36.325 --> 00:57:42.049]  But every single one, you know, they just waved off as acts of ISIS, but not protected moderates.
[00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:47.491]  But now the moderates have proved to be worse than ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[00:57:47.551 --> 00:58:01.355]  And in fact, in the newly out video of the translation of the beheading, this moderate CIA trained group said, we are worse than ISIS.
[00:58:01.415 --> 00:58:03.356]  You should see how brutal we are.
[00:58:03.756 --> 00:58:05.657]  That was just before they beheaded the child.
[00:58:06.117 --> 00:58:11.599]  So, you know, it comes to now the point where we can prove that
[00:58:12.912 --> 00:58:13.372]  The U.S.
[00:58:13.692 --> 00:58:23.858]  State Department, Obama, and his whole administration, including Clinton, put guns and taxpayers' money in the arms of something that is worse than ISIS.
[00:58:24.118 --> 00:58:29.081]  So, I wonder, when is there going to be some legal repercussions to that?
[00:58:29.481 --> 00:58:31.602]  Not only because it's against the U.S.
[00:58:31.903 --> 00:58:36.105]  law and is basically an act of treason, but also in the international law.
[00:58:36.125 --> 00:58:41.088]  Because of course, if you're going to give weapons to terrorists, that is a crime.
[00:58:42.435 --> 00:58:43.736]  And that's it for our show tonight.
[00:58:43.776 --> 00:58:47.859]  We do encourage you to go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get yourself a free trial.

[00:58:52.683 --> 00:58:56.726]  Well, I'm Jakari Jackson from the InfoWars Command Center, and we'll see you again next week.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.932]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.185]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.317 --> 00:59:38.620]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
