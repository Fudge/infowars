[00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:21.692]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:23.075]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:25.760]  It is January 27th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.223]  Tonight, the FBI and the mainstream media is calling it a shootout.
[00:00:36.843 --> 00:00:49.430]  As one person is dead, an organ protest leader, Ammon Bundy, along with several others, are now behind bars after a highway confrontation with the FBI and state police.
[00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:55.774]  Meanwhile, some of the protest members are being accused of being agent provocateurs.
[00:00:56.394 --> 00:01:02.697]  Then, Barack Obama turns against Hillary and invites Bernie Sanders to the White House.
[00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:06.839]  Could this mean that a Hillary Clinton indictment is happening soon?
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.120]  God, let's hope so.
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:18.745]  Then, a new policy in a Massachusetts town wants firearm applicants to write an essay explaining why they need a gun.
[00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:19.586]  Really?
[00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.748]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:31.583]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:33.163]  You can't survive without it.
[00:01:33.363 --> 00:01:34.264]  But where do you get it?
[00:01:34.564 --> 00:01:40.326]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:46.268]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:01:46.468 --> 00:02:03.329]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.851]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:07.392]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:02:07.672 --> 00:02:08.453]  Easy assembly.
[00:02:08.713 --> 00:02:09.333]  Low maintenance.
[00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:11.455]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:35.038]  Oregon State Police and the FBI stopped two vehicles heading north on US 395.
[00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:44.243]  One of those vehicles, a white truck being driven by Oregon Militiaman Lavoie Finicum, speeds up after idling for a while.
[00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:48.785]  It is then that Lavoie Finicum and the other passengers run into a roadblock.
[00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:59.095]  Finnecum leaves the vehicle and raises his hands when a man from behind him shoots Finnecum for reasons that still remain unclear according to this FBI released video.
[00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:08.064]  Finnecum's daughter claims that her father was murdered, execution style, with his hands in the air, an account backed up by an eyewitness to the incident.
[00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:13.629]  But the movement of Lavoie's arm on the FBI video raises even more questions.
[00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:17.572]  Did the movement of Lavoie's arm legitimize excessive force?
[00:03:17.852 --> 00:03:22.696]  Was he covering a wound, getting his balance in deep snow, or reaching for a weapon?
[00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:25.818]  What brought us to this dark day of liberty gone wrong?
[00:03:26.175 --> 00:03:28.436]  Joe Biggs reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:03:28.456 --> 00:03:30.237]  Now, we just arrived in Oregon.
[00:03:30.597 --> 00:03:42.061]  We've come here to investigate the reports of armed militiamen overthrowing a federal government building here at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, right outside of Burns, Oregon.
[00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:49.064]  Now, there have been reports that they have taken this building, they're using it as a place to protest against the U.S.
[00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:54.546]  government, who time and time again have overstepped their boundaries taking up people's lands.
[00:03:54.966 --> 00:03:56.527]  It's not just happening in Nevada.
[00:03:56.787 --> 00:03:58.108]  It's not just happening in Oregon.
[00:03:58.128 --> 00:04:01.230]  It's happening back home where I live in Texas as well.
[00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.751]  This is a huge issue.
[00:04:02.991 --> 00:04:03.931]  It's a huge problem.
[00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:12.036]  And Amon Bundy says that they do have credible intel from three different sources that they believe that the FBI will be coming down on them.
[00:04:12.476 --> 00:04:24.143]  Now one of the gentlemen is sitting down over there right now on top of a sleeping bag holding his rifle said that he heard that the police department had issued a warrant for his arrest and that he was going to stand his ground
[00:04:24.483 --> 00:04:28.165]  And sit down over there for the next few days and not go inside, but sit out there.
[00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:33.287]  He said he'd rather spend his last days out in nature than to die inside of a building.
[00:04:33.687 --> 00:04:39.469]  Now Amon Bundy seemed very concerned that the FBI was going to come after them tonight at some point in time, possibly.
[00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:41.810]  We need to learn from our mistakes.
[00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.852]  And I have been through this so many times, watching people get set up and manipulated.
[00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:48.073]  It makes me want to throw up.
[00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:54.117]  And the exact aftermath of what we predicted and the players and what was going on is now being confirmed.
[00:04:54.418 --> 00:05:00.439]  About four or five hundred yards down there is a blockade by the police, by the FBI.
[00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:05.401]  We went down to that blockade and surprisingly they were pretty chill today.
[00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:11.683]  We went up and talked to them and said look we'd be willing to go in and talk to the people who are still in there.
[00:05:11.723 --> 00:05:13.523]  Reports are there's still about five people.
[00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:16.184]  Besides the ones who were arrested at the
[00:05:16.904 --> 00:05:17.444]  We're good to go.
[00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:38.227]  What's the grievances of these groups out here?
[00:05:38.327 --> 00:05:44.869]  It's now become about this militarized standoff, whether or not these guys are going to get out, whether or not they're going to go down fighting.
[00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.511]  It's understood and acknowledged, has been for some time, even in the mainstream press,
[00:05:51.591 --> 00:06:01.937]  That the Russians, by whom I mean Putin, have gained control over 20% of US uranium production.
[00:06:02.497 --> 00:06:05.539]  And in order for that deal to be signed off on,
[00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:16.925]  One of the federal agencies of the United States that had to okay it, because this is national security, is the State Department, then headed up by Hillary Clinton.
[00:06:17.506 --> 00:06:28.072]  During this negotiation, this period of time, some millions of dollars were coming into the Clinton Foundation from Canadian mining big shots.
[00:06:29.053 --> 00:06:34.518]  Who obviously wanted this deal to go through and sell their company to Putin.
[00:06:35.058 --> 00:06:42.345]  So the ultimate irony of this whole thing is that you've got these sovereign cattle ranchers and their supporters.
[00:06:43.857 --> 00:06:59.083]  Sitting there in this area saying the feds have no right to be grabbing this land in the first place and you know it's taking land away from the American people that belongs to the American people and they could very well be talking about Russian land.
[00:06:59.463 --> 00:07:11.692]  The four remaining holdouts, David Fry, Sandy Anderson, Shawn Anderson and Jeff Banta are still holding their ground at the National Wildlife Refuge and now are demanding pardons for everyone involved.
[00:07:11.892 --> 00:07:16.455]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com And another excellent report from John Bowne.
[00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:21.939]  Now let's talk about something that's much lacking in excellence in my personal opinion, a debate system.
[00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:33.306]  Now, to be fair, most debates are pretty long, dry, boring, talking point, education, military, you know, whatever else, you know, fix the bridges and the roads and all that.
[00:07:34.207 --> 00:07:37.429]  And by and large, they've been pretty dry until Donald Trump came along.
[00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:38.109]  So I do give him that.
[00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:39.650]  We'll talk about Trump here in one second.
[00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:46.955]  But in my personal opinion, the guy who won this debate and wins pretty much every debate for the simple fact that he brings up real issues, Rand Paul.
[00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:49.717]  Grandpa once again came out in grand fashion.
[00:07:49.757 --> 00:07:53.719]  Now, I know he's not the most charismatic guy, but I think he does bring real issues to the table.
[00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:59.123]  He doesn't just say, let's arm the military and have them go out and blow up the universe and be Team America, World Police.
[00:07:59.443 --> 00:08:03.406]  He said, let's look at these conflicts and see if we really need to go there in the first place.
[00:08:03.886 --> 00:08:06.447]  Also, people want to talk about, you know, stuff on the back end.
[00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:08.928]  These half measures of, you know, fixing the VA and all that.
[00:08:08.968 --> 00:08:10.389]  And that stuff does need to happen.
[00:08:10.429 --> 00:08:11.970]  Don't let me discredit that one bit.
[00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.791]  But, why don't we look at it?
[00:08:13.891 --> 00:08:19.453]  Do we really need to send these guys out there in the first place to be in these places that they don't need to be fighting for things they don't understand?
[00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:21.654]  There's a great quote in that movie, 13 Hours.
[00:08:22.094 --> 00:08:27.137]  One of the guys, you know, he's on the roof and he's, you know, trying to figure out whether or not he's going to survive the night or not.
[00:08:27.737 --> 00:08:31.660]  And he says, you know, if I die today, my daughters will die.
[00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:37.905]  My daughters will know knowing that I died fighting for a country that meant nothing to me in a situation I really didn't understand.
[00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:44.571]  That's what happens is so many of our fighting men and women, they're fighting for things they don't even clearly understand when they're just boots on the ground.
[00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:46.712]  They just know people are making policies above them.
[00:08:46.732 --> 00:08:48.174]  But let me get back to Rand Paul.
[00:08:48.534 --> 00:08:51.116]  He says he is the only candidate for the Liberty vote.
[00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:51.997]  And I do agree.
[00:08:52.597 --> 00:09:01.163]  Because Rand Paul is the only guy who consistently comes out and opposes the NSA, domestic spying, militarized police, on and on and on.
[00:09:01.183 --> 00:09:02.464]  And it's not just my opinion.
[00:09:02.805 --> 00:09:10.731]  People like Time Magazine, they said that Paul took full advantage of his prime time slot and, you know, Rand wanted to say he's the only choice for the Liberty vote.
[00:09:10.751 --> 00:09:11.851]  And I do agree with that.
[00:09:11.891 --> 00:09:21.559]  There are many other people who I think would make decent cabinet members or maybe a VP, but for the number one spot, the numero uno, my choice is Rand Paul, hands down.
[00:09:22.119 --> 00:09:24.642]  Now, I know there are many people out there who are Trump supporters.
[00:09:25.963 --> 00:09:31.188]  And Trump had his own event, he had success with that, pretty much following what Rand did in the last debate.
[00:09:31.608 --> 00:09:35.172]  Rand said, hey, I'm just gonna break off, do my own deal, and I think that worked out very well for him.
[00:09:35.452 --> 00:09:42.279]  Now, you can debate how well that worked for Trump, because Trump usually gets a whole lot of time in these debates anyway, Rand usually doesn't.
[00:09:42.819 --> 00:09:52.947]  You can gauge whether or not it worked out for him, but I think in general, without talking about Trump or anything else, I'm very happy to see these candidates breaking off from the mainstream apparatus.
[00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.248]  They're saying, I don't need you.
[00:09:54.388 --> 00:09:55.148]  I don't want you.
[00:09:55.209 --> 00:09:58.791]  I'm not going to answer your stupid questions about fantasy football or whatever else.
[00:09:59.172 --> 00:09:59.952]  I'm going to go out here.
[00:10:00.012 --> 00:10:03.034]  I'm going to engage the people directly and talk about real issues.
[00:10:03.795 --> 00:10:04.676]  That's what Rand did.
[00:10:04.756 --> 00:10:08.818]  Now, as far as Trump, you know, he was trying to appeal to the veterans, which, you know, is fine.
[00:10:08.878 --> 00:10:09.879]  It's respectable.
[00:10:09.939 --> 00:10:12.301]  But I really wish he would have talked about more issues.
[00:10:12.341 --> 00:10:15.083]  That's what Joe Biggs discussed last night in our debate coverage.
[00:10:15.103 --> 00:10:18.985]  He says, as a veteran, I just don't want to hear, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that, I'm going to do that.
[00:10:19.025 --> 00:10:20.026]  I want an actual plan.
[00:10:20.066 --> 00:10:23.748]  So I do agree with Joe Biggs on his assessment of the Trump event.
[00:10:24.029 --> 00:10:26.730]  We need more issues, not just talking points.
[00:10:27.671 --> 00:10:35.681]  Now my issue with Donald Trump, in case you missed last night's debate and you didn't get to hear the reason why I don't support Donald Trump, I'll go through it briefly here.
[00:10:36.929 --> 00:10:43.730]  Starting with Hillary Clinton, you know, it's been Governor Ventura, Governor Jesse Ventura, he says, wrestling is just like politics.
[00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.871]  I hate this guy and this guy's a scum of the earth.
[00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:50.072]  And meanwhile, they're out having beers and, you know, eating steak dinners and stuff like that.
[00:10:50.632 --> 00:10:53.092]  That's Donald Trump's relationship with Hillary Clinton.
[00:10:53.232 --> 00:10:58.653]  As much as he may talk about her, as she may talk about him, he invited Hillary Clinton to his wedding.
[00:10:58.673 --> 00:11:05.175]  So I'm not exactly convinced these guys are the most bitter of enemies, you know, similar to what you saw Obama and Hillary do during their campaign.
[00:11:05.195 --> 00:11:06.535]  And of course, he ended up working for him.
[00:11:07.035 --> 00:11:08.277]  We're good to go.
[00:11:26.198 --> 00:11:29.639]  That's another reason he wants to increase the domestic surveillance state.
[00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:31.459]  Something very big, a big no-no.
[00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:33.460]  As I just said, Rand Paul has been railing against it.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:38.280]  We here at the Infowars.com studio have been railing against the surveillance state.
[00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:40.681]  He said, hey, you know, it's going to be huge.
[00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:43.662]  You know, you got these guys crying about First Amendment, First Amendment.
[00:11:43.942 --> 00:11:45.082]  We need to get past all that.
[00:11:45.102 --> 00:11:49.363]  So that's another issue I have with Trump, as well as the many controversial statements he says.
[00:11:49.423 --> 00:11:50.303]  Now, I do respect
[00:11:50.723 --> 00:11:53.927]  That he says what's on his mind, that's very admirable to me.
[00:11:53.987 --> 00:11:56.550]  Even if I don't agree with it all the time, I do give him that.
[00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.971]  But that's enough time on Trump.
[00:11:58.172 --> 00:12:00.875]  Now for our final story before we go into more special reports.
[00:12:00.955 --> 00:12:01.556]  Vaccines!
[00:12:02.016 --> 00:12:06.221]  You don't hear much about vaccines because the laws Reagan passed pretty much make sure that you wouldn't do it.
[00:12:06.541 --> 00:12:09.765]  But we've seen kids die of vaccines in Syria, in Mexico.
[00:12:09.825 --> 00:12:11.427]  They never talk about this on the news.
[00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:16.652]  When they do talk about it on the news, it's Katie Couric with a girl who's dying from some vaccine and they got the doctor over here.
[00:12:16.672 --> 00:12:17.793]  All those things are very rare.
[00:12:17.813 --> 00:12:21.596]  So let's end with a special report from John Bowne talking about the Zika virus.
[00:12:21.656 --> 00:12:25.780]  Brought to you by the world's deadliest creature, the mosquito.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.204]  Well, there's no specific treatment for Zika virus disease and there's no vaccine.
[00:12:30.724 --> 00:12:36.950]  However, we have seen that most of the cases are mild or some of them do not even show any symptoms.
[00:12:37.335 --> 00:12:54.063]  Currently a vaccine for Zika doesn't exist, but the necessity of one could bring Bill Gates' lifelong world depopulation preoccupation one step closer to its IBM and Microsoft Eugenics Industrial Complex vision.
[00:12:54.264 --> 00:13:06.950]  Zika virus, a virus spread to humans by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same mosquito that produces yellow fever, dengue, and chikungunya, and is found in the Americas, Africa, Asia, India,
[00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.670]  The BBC reports.
[00:13:30.916 --> 00:13:38.802]  Health officials battling the Zika virus in Brazil say as many as 100,000 people could have been infected in one city alone.
[00:13:39.142 --> 00:13:44.786]  About 3,500 cases of microcephaly have been identified in Brazil so far.
[00:13:45.206 --> 00:13:54.893]  But before we sound the alarm, there is zero evidence that the Zika, or Zika virus, could be causing the microcephaly outbreak.
[00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:56.053]  Giant scam.
[00:13:56.994 --> 00:14:11.910]  I've been to this rodeo many times before with viruses and so-called diseases being caused by viruses, and in my recent article at No More Fake News, I run down the useless and deceptive
[00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:26.640]  Laboratory tests that try to define how, for example, the Zika virus is causing babies to be born with smaller heads and damaged brains, and the science absolutely does not hold up.
[00:14:27.699 --> 00:14:40.063]  But what does hold up as a cause of this happening, and I believe there are multiple causes, and you need to look to Brazil for example, you are talking about gigantic amounts of pesticide use down there.
[00:14:40.763 --> 00:14:44.104]  They use more pesticides in Brazil than any country in the world.
[00:14:44.664 --> 00:14:46.205]  Any country in the world.
[00:14:46.965 --> 00:14:50.266]  And many of these pesticides are banned.
[00:14:50.846 --> 00:15:00.374]  Oddly enough though, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded Oxitec mosquito release experiment conducted in Brazil last year preceded the explosion of microcephaly cases in Brazil.
[00:15:16.767 --> 00:15:23.850]  Brazil, home to over 200 million people, and the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, is losing the battle.
[00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:35.454]  The Associated Press reports, Brazil's health minister says the country will mobilize some 220,000 troops, but he was also quoted Tuesday as saying the battle is already being lost.
[00:15:35.794 --> 00:15:47.983]  Castro said that nearly 220,000 members of Brazil's armed forces would go door-to-door to help in mosquito eradication efforts, according to Rio de Janeiro's O Globo newspaper.
[00:15:48.283 --> 00:15:50.685]  Door-to-door mosquito eradication efforts?
[00:15:51.045 --> 00:15:59.091]  Something the totalitarian, gun-grabbing White House administration could swoop down and capitalize on if an outbreak occurs in the United States.
[00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:04.356]  Now, evidence of the Zika virus reaching the United States has been confirmed.
[00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:15.486]  The Los Angeles Public Health Department reported one confirmed case of the Zika virus in the United States after a teenage girl was diagnosed after traveling to El Salvador in November of 2015.
[00:16:16.607 --> 00:16:18.649]  The LA Health Department states, quote,
[00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:42.851]  Which wouldn't be an issue if our immigration laws were actually enforced.
[00:16:43.071 --> 00:16:46.675]  However, potential Zika-infected humans are crossing the U.S.
[00:16:46.735 --> 00:16:48.197]  border every day.
[00:16:48.437 --> 00:16:52.882]  But never fear, Bill Gates and his eugenics-based obsession God Solution is here.
[00:16:53.102 --> 00:17:00.611]  With the blessings of the United Nations, the Oxitec Corporation secretly released 3 million genetically engineered mosquitoes.
[00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:08.841]  Into the Cayman Island mosquito population, devastating the native mosquito population by 96%, which sounds like a victory.
[00:17:09.081 --> 00:17:20.355]  However, the male genetically modified mosquitoes are spliced with protein fragments of E. coli and herpes that act as the kill switch when they mate with the female native mosquitoes.
[00:17:20.715 --> 00:17:29.884]  Oxitec argues that male mosquitoes don't bite, but studies discover the genetically engineered females had been released with the males in smaller numbers.
[00:17:30.224 --> 00:17:37.892]  Plus, the potential for a human to inhale or expose a wound to the genetically engineered DNA is blatantly being ignored.
[00:17:38.332 --> 00:17:51.620]  As is the potential for the mosquitoes to develop a resistance to the lethal gene and or breed in infinite quantity if exposed to the nature infused pools of the tetracycline they need to survive.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:59.965]  Currently, Bill Gates' Oxitec plague of genetically engineered mosquitoes have not yet been released into the Florida Keys as planned.
[00:18:00.325 --> 00:18:10.463]  But it appears that Brazil's plight and the hype generated by the mainstream media may twist the arm of the FDA to allow the inevitable catastrophe to move forward.
[00:18:16.323 --> 00:18:21.248]  Shane Steiner's involvement with InfoWarsLife.com truly happened in an organic way.
[00:18:21.388 --> 00:18:29.996]  I went to high school with Shane, his brother, knew his parents well, and he was visiting the office once, hadn't been to the office in years, and said, wow, I notice you're making and selling supplements.
[00:18:30.016 --> 00:18:30.777]  Do these really work?
[00:18:30.817 --> 00:18:35.862]  Because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout enthusiast, and I really think most of them are hype.
[00:18:35.902 --> 00:18:37.403]  And I said, here, take some home, try it.
[00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:44.048]  Well, a few weeks later, he came in, blown away, and said, I want to buy three boxes of this stuff to give my friends and family.
[00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:45.969]  It's simply amazing.
[00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:47.290]  He said, why does it work so well?
[00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.854]  And I said, listen, go to Infowarslife.com, watch the informational videos with Dr. Group and others.
[00:18:52.074 --> 00:18:53.575]  They understand how it all works.
[00:18:53.855 --> 00:18:55.436]  I know that it works for me.
[00:18:55.556 --> 00:18:56.697]  That's all I understand.
[00:18:56.957 --> 00:19:02.001]  The science, the facts, the research, people's testimonials, they're all on Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:02.021 --> 00:19:03.002]  You can check it out for yourself.
[00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:04.683]  I wanted to go to the gym.
[00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:14.788]  I wanted to push myself and work out harder, and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the barefooting and the surfing and stuff like that, which I would have never done.
[00:19:14.808 --> 00:19:17.329]  I never would have done that two years ago.
[00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:21.551]  Shane has said over and over again, more than just libido and energy,
[00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:23.873]  It made him want to get into the gym more.
[00:19:24.214 --> 00:19:25.675]  It made him want to get in better shape.
[00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:28.338]  And believe me, the Steiners have amazing genetics.
[00:19:28.879 --> 00:19:31.322]  His brother is a world champion steer wrestler.
[00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:35.647]  His dad, Bobby Steiner, is a famous world champion bull rider.
[00:19:35.847 --> 00:19:37.509]  They've got natural genetics.
[00:19:37.949 --> 00:19:42.675]  But when you added this to the mix, in Shane's own words, it took him to the next level.
[00:19:54.972 --> 00:19:56.673]  Shane noticed the mental clarity.
[00:19:57.134 --> 00:20:00.616]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass.
[00:20:00.736 --> 00:20:02.037]  He's already completely shredded.
[00:20:02.237 --> 00:20:04.899]  I gotta admit, for me, the biggest effect has been libido.
[00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:11.303]  Now, I've never claimed to have a body like some beach model, but back when I was 20, 22 years old and worked out every day, I looked great.
[00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:17.368]  But over the years and being married, having three kids, working 18 hours a day, I gained basically 100 pounds.
[00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.650]  And it's been a long process of losing that weight in the last four years.
[00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.392]  But if you look at the photos and the videos,
[00:20:23.752 --> 00:20:24.112]  We're good to go.
[00:20:42.837 --> 00:20:52.901]  This has actually made me feel so good that here lately, about a year ago, I started training jiu-jitsu and that kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing.
[00:20:52.921 --> 00:21:05.407]  I mean, it's amazing that two years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be doing ever again.
[00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:07.528]  So, Supermail Vitality has
[00:21:08.408 --> 00:21:08.929]  I don't know.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.140]  You'll love it.
[00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:12.436]  Bottom line folks, you want to discover the power of super male vitality and super female vitality for yourself by visiting InfoWarsLife.com today or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:20.097 --> 00:22:21.738]  Kelly, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:22:21.878 --> 00:22:23.579]  So let's go back to the beginning.
[00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:27.220]  How did you first get involved with covering the Flint water crisis?
[00:22:28.041 --> 00:22:32.383]  Oh, well, actually, it was through social media.
[00:22:33.943 --> 00:22:43.148]  I sort of became friends with a person down there that has been sort of the main voice for the city of Flint.
[00:22:44.068 --> 00:22:48.230]  And he was sort of just telling me all these issues that they were having with the water.
[00:22:49.244 --> 00:22:51.566]  And I kind of went like, this is really bad.
[00:22:51.686 --> 00:22:54.227]  Like, you need to get Erin Brockovich.
[00:22:54.247 --> 00:22:56.989]  You need to get her and we need to let her know what's going on.
[00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:58.150]  And he's like, who?
[00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:03.353]  So, yeah, I kind of give him heck for not knowing who that was.
[00:23:04.254 --> 00:23:07.596]  And then I just said, you know what?
[00:23:08.657 --> 00:23:09.137]  I'll get her.
[00:23:09.317 --> 00:23:09.958]  Like, we'll get her.
[00:23:09.998 --> 00:23:11.739]  She's going to hear about this.
[00:23:12.788 --> 00:23:25.979]  I took every document, every water report, everything I could possibly find, anything that he could give me, and I peppered that poor woman with emails and tweets and just relentlessly.
[00:23:25.999 --> 00:23:34.126]  And after about two or three weeks, she had put out a post on Facebook.
[00:23:35.348 --> 00:23:38.390]  It was basically calling Flint out, like, what's in your water type of thing.
[00:23:39.311 --> 00:23:40.332]  And so that's
[00:23:41.255 --> 00:23:48.160]  Sort of where everything kind of came about and I just wanted to help.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:49.841]  I mean, I felt really bad.
[00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:53.564]  I mean, there's families down there, there's people suffering.
[00:23:53.624 --> 00:23:56.246]  I thought this is, you know, I have to do something.
[00:23:57.972 --> 00:24:14.486]  Right, and that's kind of a testament to show how powerful social media can be and how a lot of people, they don't like sort of the relentless trolling that sometimes goes on with social media, but it can have a positive effect if you're able to get people's attention.
[00:24:15.347 --> 00:24:15.847]  We're good to go.
[00:24:44.444 --> 00:24:56.488]  What you were feeling and just gathering as you were starting to investigate a little more with Leanne, you can see that article there, lead poisoning in Flint, doctors refusing to treat water-related health issues.
[00:24:57.869 --> 00:25:08.913]  Yeah, after I wrote the first article, I got an email about a month later from a woman, Leanne, and she was basically, she's desperate.
[00:25:09.483 --> 00:25:12.784]  She had gone to everybody and nobody would listen.
[00:25:12.864 --> 00:25:17.404]  No, the local news, everybody had turned her way and she was just like, can you please like help me?
[00:25:17.484 --> 00:25:20.305]  I can't, you know, no one's listening.
[00:25:20.425 --> 00:25:21.845]  And so I said, yeah, I can help you.
[00:25:21.905 --> 00:25:22.565]  I can do this.
[00:25:22.705 --> 00:25:25.686]  And of course, and we'll, we'll get your story out.
[00:25:25.746 --> 00:25:28.486]  And I just was determined that we're going to get this heard.
[00:25:29.287 --> 00:25:33.027]  And that's how Leanne and I came to know each other.
[00:25:33.247 --> 00:25:35.968]  And that's how that the second article came.
[00:25:36.088 --> 00:25:36.288]  And, um,
[00:25:37.972 --> 00:25:43.678]  I sort of pushed the local news to cover the story.
[00:25:43.698 --> 00:25:50.846]  And I let people, by that time there was, you know, Flint crisis groups on Facebook and stuff like that.
[00:25:50.886 --> 00:25:56.592]  And I had just told, said to everybody, look, he's going to talk, if you're willing to talk on camera, he's willing to interview.
[00:25:57.492 --> 00:26:00.436]  And just, it sort of just went from there.
[00:26:01.837 --> 00:26:06.161]  Were you surprised at how difficult it was to get people to cover this story?
[00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:14.968]  And talk briefly about your experience for anyone out there who's maybe afraid to speak out or once they get a little bit of pushback then they give up.
[00:26:15.288 --> 00:26:20.993]  Whereas, you know, you guys for more than a year were just trying to get people to pay attention to the story.
[00:26:21.033 --> 00:26:22.254]  So talk to me a little bit about that.
[00:26:23.171 --> 00:26:31.354]  Well, I think a lot of the problem was that the local news can, you know, they can only do so much, like they're doing small articles.
[00:26:31.394 --> 00:26:33.834]  So people were getting information in small little tidbits.
[00:26:34.895 --> 00:26:48.799]  And I think part of the problem is a lot of places think, well, Flint's just being whiny and, you know, like they brush it off because of their violence, their crime rates.
[00:26:49.668 --> 00:26:57.354]  And I think part of the other problem that people had was a lot of the people that I spoke with personally didn't want to talk on camera.
[00:26:57.694 --> 00:27:04.159]  And they were fighting for, they wanted something to happen, but they weren't willing to speak with the media.
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:11.745]  And so you kind of had to coax people out a little bit so that they could get the story out.
[00:27:12.802 --> 00:27:22.486]  Right, I know when we spoke with a bunch of people there in Flint, that's exactly what they said, that they would be afraid to speak out because they didn't want to be harassed there by city officials.
[00:27:22.826 --> 00:27:35.032]  And of course, the story here with Leanne, she initially was bringing the videos to the doctor, and the doctor at first was sort of supportive and wanting to treat the patient, but then I guess got a little bit of heat.
[00:27:35.532 --> 00:27:35.752]  Coming
[00:27:55.413 --> 00:27:56.914]  Almost an international story.
[00:27:56.934 --> 00:28:00.897]  I think worldwide people are talking about this crisis there in Flint.
[00:28:01.318 --> 00:28:03.779]  Are you happy with the response so far?
[00:28:03.839 --> 00:28:10.304]  What you've seen Michael Moore come out and say, you know, now he's calling for actually more government to take care of the problem.
[00:28:10.344 --> 00:28:12.526]  But are you happy with the response?
[00:28:13.927 --> 00:28:14.868]  I was surprised.
[00:28:15.208 --> 00:28:21.433]  I because we had been working on it for so long and nothing was happening.
[00:28:21.513 --> 00:28:24.535]  And I had taken some time away.
[00:28:25.838 --> 00:28:38.706]  To deal with a family issue and after a couple months I was in the coffee shop and I look up on the TV and there goes across the bottom of the page and up the screen and I was like, oh my gosh.
[00:28:39.287 --> 00:28:53.736]  So I was really surprised and I think now that it's made national news, there's a lot of celebrities and things like Walmart and different organizations wanting to donate a lot and wanting to help.
[00:28:54.708 --> 00:28:56.189]  And so I think that's really good.
[00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:08.418]  Now, on a personal level, after I wrote this article, I hounded people both on Facebook and on Twitter to get their water tested with lead.
[00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:13.962]  And I just went by one by one by one, get your water tested, get your water tested.
[00:29:14.102 --> 00:29:18.746]  And that sort of made people see how big the problem was.
[00:29:18.786 --> 00:29:20.427]  And they just sort of grew from there.
[00:29:20.487 --> 00:29:21.888]  So I kind of feel like
[00:29:23.949 --> 00:29:27.735]  Yeah, I'm very pleased because it got help.
[00:29:27.795 --> 00:29:28.456]  Something was done.
[00:29:28.577 --> 00:29:29.899]  Something has been changed.
[00:29:29.999 --> 00:29:36.749]  It's been looked at and it's hopefully going to make a big difference in the city.
[00:29:37.697 --> 00:29:50.607]  Right, and of course holding people's feet to the fire and staying on this to just make sure that, yeah, well now we've gotten the bottled water sent to the city, but now we need to actually fix the pipes, people need to be held accountable, justice needs to happen.
[00:29:51.007 --> 00:30:04.057]  So I guess briefly in the last minute or so, what do you want to say to others out there who might want to get involved, want to try to change things in their community, but they feel like they're completely powerless against bureaucracy?
[00:30:06.518 --> 00:30:07.459]  Don't, you're not.
[00:30:08.319 --> 00:30:13.001]  I'll tell you something that a lot of people don't know, is that I'm from Canada.
[00:30:13.462 --> 00:30:14.642]  I don't live in Flint.
[00:30:15.462 --> 00:30:16.423]  I live in Ontario.
[00:30:17.263 --> 00:30:20.305]  And I did it all with a Twitter account and a WordPress.
[00:30:21.225 --> 00:30:22.806]  And just persistence.
[00:30:23.046 --> 00:30:26.387]  And I think the people down in Flint have done the same thing.
[00:30:26.888 --> 00:30:32.050]  And so if I can do it, if I can have the mayor of this city call my phone,
[00:30:33.274 --> 00:30:36.497]  Because of an article that I wrote, you know, then you can do it.
[00:30:36.577 --> 00:30:37.178]  Like, you can.
[00:30:37.258 --> 00:30:41.742]  And just, that's the whole thing is, like, speak out and be consistent and just don't give up.
[00:30:42.462 --> 00:30:52.511]  Because, like I said, if some woman from Canada can make, make change and bring about change in a place like Flint, then, you know, you, there's no excuse.
[00:30:53.032 --> 00:30:54.393]  Just don't give up.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:55.700]  Absolutely.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.341]  Well, Kelly Mooney, thank you so much for all your work.
[00:30:58.401 --> 00:31:03.962]  I suppose the name of your blog is Coventina Speaks, which I looked it up, that's the goddess of wells and springs.
[00:31:04.382 --> 00:31:06.423]  So is this going to be kind of your niche here?
[00:31:06.623 --> 00:31:08.543]  Are you going to stick with this?
[00:31:08.563 --> 00:31:15.865]  Yeah, because after I put out that first article, I had a lot of people contact me from all over the world.
[00:31:16.385 --> 00:31:16.745]  Ireland,
[00:31:17.889 --> 00:31:23.332]  Of course, there's a lot of problems with our water in Canada and in the States.
[00:31:23.452 --> 00:31:25.133]  It's a national problem down in the States.
[00:31:25.213 --> 00:31:26.713]  It's a national problem in Canada.
[00:31:27.494 --> 00:31:34.057]  And so I think that's sort of the direction people have been wanting me to go with it, I guess.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:41.243]  Yeah, well it's so important and it definitely affects us all and truly I believe that what we're seeing there in Flint is just the beginning.
[00:31:41.723 --> 00:31:49.527]  It is a nationwide, if not worldwide, issue to make sure that we are staying on top of what exactly is in our water.
[00:31:50.027 --> 00:31:56.750]  Kelly, thank you so much for all of your work and please stay tuned if you have any new news that you'd like to break here on the show.
[00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:57.730]  We'll be speaking with you soon.
[00:31:58.551 --> 00:31:59.231]  Thank you very much.
[00:32:04.348 --> 00:32:04.690]  I'm good.
[00:32:27.142 --> 00:32:36.406]  You guys have the exclusive for which is a product called Deep Cleanse and why I'm so excited about it is it's a unique formula almost like the iodine crystals.
[00:32:36.506 --> 00:32:40.268]  We have two unique products that nobody in the world has.
[00:32:40.648 --> 00:32:52.434]  One of the most amazing ingredients in the world and it's called Shilajit and it's actually known as blood of the mountain or rock sweat because thousands of years ago, as a matter of fact, this ingredient
[00:32:52.634 --> 00:32:59.038]  Was only given to the elite of the elite thousands of years ago up in the Himalayan mountains and in Tibet.
[00:32:59.078 --> 00:33:02.901]  And we wanted to put this in stuff for a couple years, but we couldn't get an organic form.
[00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:03.301]  Right.
[00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:04.422]  I mean, let's explain.
[00:33:04.482 --> 00:33:07.624]  I mean, this stuff's so good, we couldn't put it out for years.
[00:33:07.904 --> 00:33:16.353]  Right, so I had to actually, it's kind of like the iodine crystals, finding a source deep in the earth that we could get the cleanest source available.
[00:33:16.793 --> 00:33:26.363]  But in Tibet and in Nepal and in the Himalayan mountains, thousands of years ago they found, they watched these monkeys and during the summer months the monkeys would go up into the mountains.
[00:33:26.384 --> 00:33:27.625]  Now you're being racist against monkeys.
[00:33:27.665 --> 00:33:28.306]  And they would pick
[00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:31.207]  This black substance from the mountains.
[00:33:31.668 --> 00:33:38.171]  And so in Russia, they actually, it grows in Russia and the mountains and in the Himalayas and only in the summer.
[00:33:38.272 --> 00:33:46.476]  And shilajit is actually the decomposition of up to 7,000 different medicinal herbs.
[00:33:46.536 --> 00:33:53.200]  So it decomposes, all these different herbs decompose in the Himalayan mountains and the volcanic soil up there.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.483]  And what happens in the summertime... So it's almost like an oil from
[00:33:58.343 --> 00:34:01.046]  Yes, it's high in fulvic acid, it's high in humic acid.
[00:34:01.086 --> 00:34:05.411]  Because they're always claiming oil is really from decomposed animals and plants.
[00:34:05.972 --> 00:34:10.417]  There is some oil that is based from fossils, but most of it's really abiotic.
[00:34:10.818 --> 00:34:14.823]  So this is a true fossil source?
[00:34:14.843 --> 00:34:15.583]  I mean, explain it to me.
[00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:16.624]  It is.
[00:34:17.024 --> 00:34:22.345]  It's really the decomposition, like I said, of over 7,000 different medicinal herbs and plants.
[00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:26.306]  And with the rocks and the pressure deep in the mountains, it freezes.
[00:34:26.386 --> 00:34:31.327]  And during the summertime and the pressures build it up, it oozes out.
[00:34:31.427 --> 00:34:33.007]  So it literally oozes out of the mountain.
[00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:33.827]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:34.187 --> 00:34:35.188]  It's like rock sap.
[00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:38.348]  It's black and it's highly nutritious.
[00:34:39.188 --> 00:34:41.809]  Even in the 1980s, when the Olympic
[00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:44.850]  Athletes in Russia were accused of being on steroids.
[00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:52.231]  They found out that they were actually been given Shilajit because it works as an anabolic as well and it builds muscles.
[00:34:52.431 --> 00:34:53.491]  It's a big dose in there.
[00:34:53.511 --> 00:35:03.234]  The second big main ingredient in there is a volcanic zeolite concentrate and what this formula is designed to do, the Shilajit and the zeolites have a real strong negative charge.
[00:35:03.694 --> 00:35:08.615]  All the metals and chemicals and PCBs and VOCs have positive charges.
[00:35:09.415 --> 00:35:17.522]  So these go in, they grab it, and then they safely eliminate it through the body so you can become healthy.
[00:35:17.563 --> 00:35:21.506]  I mean, this is an amazing formula.
[00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:27.512]  I wish I actually had it, but because this was an exclusive InfoWars Life product, you're the only one in the world that has.
[00:35:28.132 --> 00:35:36.039]  This formula now and, you know, there is going to be a limited supply available when you sell out because you can only harvest this once a year.
[00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:37.260]  How do people take it?
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.622]  How is it recommended that this be done?
[00:35:39.722 --> 00:35:41.424]  Just a daily dose?
[00:35:41.704 --> 00:35:43.446]  Yeah, daily dose.
[00:35:43.526 --> 00:35:44.907]  The instructions are on the label.
[00:35:44.927 --> 00:35:48.330]  You know, of course, I kind of modify it for each individual.
[00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.931]  It depends on what your lifestyle is.
[00:35:49.971 --> 00:35:55.076]  I mean, honestly, the best thing to do is for you to avoid all these chemicals and toxins in your environment.
[00:35:55.376 --> 00:35:55.456]  Yeah.
[00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:18.416]  These aren't just great products.
[00:36:18.436 --> 00:36:20.197]  This is how we fund this independent operation.
[00:36:20.217 --> 00:36:25.422]  We're not taxpayer-funded like MSNBC or NPR, and neither is your local station, so support them, folks.
[00:36:25.622 --> 00:36:26.323]  This is a war.
[00:36:30.746 --> 00:36:36.231]  Last night, on my orders, America's armed forces began strikes against ISIL targets in Syria.
[00:36:55.421 --> 00:36:58.222]  The people we are fighting today, we funded.
[00:37:20.003 --> 00:37:22.165]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:37:22.666 --> 00:37:27.810]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:37:30.453 --> 00:37:37.720]  ISIS has grabbed up from the US, from the Saudis, from the Qataris, weapons by the truckload.
[00:37:38.581 --> 00:37:44.766]  And we are now forced to fight against our own weapons, and this body wants to throw more weapons into the mix.
[00:37:45.828 --> 00:37:50.831]  And so now we go to our guest, who I really appreciate joining us.
[00:37:51.031 --> 00:37:59.135]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio in the interest of time, but Professor Francis Anthony Boyle is obviously an author.
[00:38:00.096 --> 00:38:02.137]  He is a leading American expert in international law.
[00:38:02.437 --> 00:38:11.041]  He was responsible for drafting the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 89 that was then ratified, the American implementing legislation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.
[00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:13.883]  He served on the board of the directors of Amnesty International.
[00:38:14.423 --> 00:38:14.683]  I don't know.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:36.522]  He's a world expert on nukes, bio weapons, you name it, he's got the contacts.
[00:38:50.717 --> 00:38:57.967]  He does his research and he's here to present what he thinks is going on with Zika and where he thinks it's going.
[00:38:58.507 --> 00:39:05.497]  Now, I immediately, when I heard about this weeks ago, and I've been doing my own research, I hadn't spoken yet, and Nico said, why aren't you talking about this more?
[00:39:05.517 --> 00:39:06.097]  And I said, well,
[00:39:07.284 --> 00:39:13.209]  You know, I know Bill Gates is obsessed with releasing mosquitoes to quote, give you vaccines and force medical things on you.
[00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:18.574]  And he's also involved in studying gut illnesses and things like, I mean, weather control.
[00:39:18.634 --> 00:39:20.096]  He's the head up guy on that.
[00:39:20.636 --> 00:39:26.001]  He runs the UN programs with these inoculations that keep killing people en masse and maiming them and sterilizing them.
[00:39:26.021 --> 00:39:29.724]  And they find in the vaccines, the hormone added to it to create a sterilant.
[00:39:30.105 --> 00:39:32.046]  So it's not like he's a suspect.
[00:39:32.146 --> 00:39:33.568]  He's been caught in all this.
[00:39:34.088 --> 00:39:36.531]  And his wife a few years ago made a very cryptic statement in Germany.
[00:39:36.832 --> 00:39:42.258]  She said, the people claiming we're involved in covert population control and things, you better watch it or people are going to die.
[00:39:42.278 --> 00:39:47.565]  It was a double meaning, quote, you're going to kill people not having us do this, or we're going to get you.
[00:39:48.025 --> 00:39:51.149]  But they're very, his dad ran Planned Parenthood.
[00:39:52.711 --> 00:39:54.632]  He was in Army Intelligence, high level.
[00:39:55.132 --> 00:39:56.653]  These are very serious people.
[00:39:57.253 --> 00:39:57.713]  Okay?
[00:39:57.813 --> 00:40:03.816]  And from our research, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a front for real shadow government eugenics.
[00:40:04.637 --> 00:40:05.717]  Now let's just stop right there.
[00:40:05.937 --> 00:40:09.299]  He's the main funder of gun control, you name it as well, but never gets heat for it.
[00:40:09.639 --> 00:40:11.500]  So talking about him is very dangerous.
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.101]  So we appreciate Professor Francis Boyle's courage.
[00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:16.202]  He's going to drop some heavy data on us.
[00:40:16.342 --> 00:40:20.024]  And for radio listeners, I'm going to be going through articles here while he speaks
[00:40:20.905 --> 00:40:23.027]  Backing up the things I just said, okay?
[00:40:23.488 --> 00:40:30.195]  And you can later tonight go to Infowars.com, we'll have the video of this posted, even if you're not watching us live and just listening.
[00:40:30.436 --> 00:40:37.304]  Because this isn't science fiction, this is the real world, and they're saying women shouldn't have children for a couple years, you know, in these countries now.
[00:40:37.444 --> 00:40:38.885]  Is it a scare to not have kids?
[00:40:39.746 --> 00:40:41.006]  Is that the population control?
[00:40:41.326 --> 00:40:42.627]  Causes deformities in children?
[00:40:42.887 --> 00:40:50.888]  Here to tell us what the virus does, what he really thinks is happening, and who the main suspects are, if it's a bioweapon, is Professor Francis Anthony Boyle.
[00:40:51.328 --> 00:40:52.609]  Sir, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:40:53.549 --> 00:40:58.550]  Well, Alex, thank you very much for having me on and my best to your viewing audience.
[00:40:59.010 --> 00:40:59.570]  Thank you, sir.
[00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:00.230]  You've got the floor.
[00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.031]  Go ahead and tell us what you think's going on here.
[00:41:03.571 --> 00:41:07.272]  Well, of course, I have no inside information.
[00:41:07.692 --> 00:41:09.052]  I've just been dealing with
[00:41:09.907 --> 00:41:33.517]  reputable news media sources from around the world, but it does seem to me and to others, another expert friend of mine, that what we're dealing with here is some type of bio-warfare agent that has been genetically modified, GMO.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:47.767]  So, for that reason, you really can't believe anything the WHO, the Pan American Health Organization, the CDC is telling you.
[00:41:48.767 --> 00:41:55.731]  It also appears, as you correctly point out, that Gates was involved in this.
[00:41:56.891 --> 00:42:03.515]  You know, Bill Engel has the book on Gates that he's basically a genocidalist.
[00:42:05.113 --> 00:42:15.669]  He does have people on his staff with experience having done what I call death science, life scientists who do biowarfare work.
[00:42:17.867 --> 00:42:21.348]  It appears that the U.S.
[00:42:21.609 --> 00:42:26.071]  Advanced Biowarfare Facility at Galveston was involved.
[00:42:26.812 --> 00:42:39.539]  It also appears that the BSL-4 facility at Colorado State that works with GMO-ing mosquitoes was involved.
[00:42:40.579 --> 00:42:47.123]  And that this British high-tech firm Oxitec was involved.
[00:42:47.603 --> 00:43:08.555]  What is critical here is that I believe it was the summer of 2004, there was a scholarly paper published saying that these genetically modified mosquitoes could be dangerous if they were released.
[00:43:09.551 --> 00:43:19.555]  And despite this knowledge, they were released both in Brazil and also in Colombia, deliberately and maliciously.
[00:43:20.255 --> 00:43:23.116]  Now, why Brazil and Colombia?
[00:43:23.936 --> 00:43:28.778]  Brazil, you hit the Atlantic coast.
[00:43:30.162 --> 00:43:40.726]  of Latin America, and Colombia, you hit the Pacific coast of Latin America, and you set off a pandemic.
[00:43:41.687 --> 00:43:46.648]  So, as of now, I think that's what's going on.
[00:43:47.009 --> 00:43:55.872]  I'll continue to monitor the situation and, you know, act in accordance with the best information I have.
[00:43:56.638 --> 00:44:07.266]  But I don't think you should trust anything the CDC, the WHO, the Pan American Health Organization is telling you.
[00:44:08.087 --> 00:44:09.708]  They're all in cahoots with Gates.
[00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:13.491]  The Brazilian government is in cahoots with Gates.
[00:44:14.052 --> 00:44:16.254]  They're all up to their eyeballs in this stuff.
[00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:29.080]  Right now, I personally would not be traveling down to Latin America until we have some idea precisely what we are dealing with.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:40.906]  And yet, I note on Monday, the WHO has convened an emergency meeting where they're going to tell everyone, well, just keep business and travel as usual.
[00:44:42.097 --> 00:44:59.174]  I take it they got those instructions from the CDC, and we know full well the nefarious role that the CDC, the WHO, played in the Black West African Ebola pandemic.
[00:44:59.194 --> 00:45:04.740]  You and I have already been through that, so I'm not going to go through that here.
[00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:21.209]  uh all all over uh again but it's a very dangerous situation in fact another um bio warfare uh expert former uh formerly the united states government uh that i am working with with with my approval
[00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:36.506]  has informed the administration of the University of Illinois that we don't believe anyone should be traveling down to Latin America for any reason until we know precisely what is going on here.
[00:45:38.028 --> 00:45:39.770]  This so-called Zika
[00:45:40.916 --> 00:45:52.499]  is also transmitted by sexual intercourse, which I think proves that we have a GMO bio warfare agent at work here.
[00:45:53.339 --> 00:45:57.120]  And it is also transmitted by saliva.
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.041]  And that indicates to me
[00:46:00.985 --> 00:46:13.773]  That we could be dealing with some type of GMO gain-of-function biowarfare agent, namely that it could jump.
[00:46:14.253 --> 00:46:14.794]  I don't know.
[00:46:15.934 --> 00:46:18.956]  I'm continuing to monitor the situation, see what I can.
[00:46:19.577 --> 00:46:24.620]  But under the circumstances, that's the best I can give you, Alex.
[00:46:37.887 --> 00:46:43.930]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can get six months free at PrisonPlanet.tv, but only for one more week.
[00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:47.372]  Next Monday, the special that only comes around once the year ends.
[00:46:47.432 --> 00:46:58.417]  In fact, we've never offered six months free before, but I really want to get more people to join and be able to watch The Nightly News, to see the live reports we do, the special reports, all my films, e-books, and so much more.
[00:46:59.017 --> 00:47:01.799]  One person can share their membership with 20 people.

[00:47:11.005 --> 00:47:15.689]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system to shut down.
[00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:17.490]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:23.114]  We put out the daily radio show free with the video and audio feeds at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:47:23.254 --> 00:47:31.280]  But it is the members that get the nightly news exclusively and first and the commercial free video podcasts and audio podcasts that are
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:47.026]  Paying it forward and financing and helping so many other people see the truth when we put the videos on Facebook, YouTube, and it's PrisonPlanet.tv that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew.
[00:47:47.426 --> 00:47:48.127]  The Reporters.

[00:48:39.776 --> 00:48:45.257]  So let's go to a quick comment from David Knight and of course Joe Biggs.
[00:48:45.698 --> 00:48:50.399]  Hey Alex, David Knight here in Oregon with Joe Biggs.
[00:48:51.039 --> 00:48:53.500]  Am I the first one to use the term Reagan tonight?
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:58.922]  Because you know the last person who skipped a debate just before the Iowa caucus was Ronald Reagan.
[00:48:58.942 --> 00:49:02.263]  He went on to win it with a landslide as many people pointed out.
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.902]  Absolutely, and just stay live on the feed with us, guys.
[00:49:05.942 --> 00:49:06.823]  Comment anytime you want.
[00:49:06.863 --> 00:49:07.664]  Jump in, Joe Biggs.
[00:49:09.405 --> 00:49:15.110]  Well, quite frankly, I think that Trump's little escapade is not good.
[00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:17.012]  I think he's exploiting veterans.
[00:49:17.652 --> 00:49:19.534]  I, quite frankly, don't like what he's doing.
[00:49:20.795 --> 00:49:26.840]  I personally think Rand Paul is about the only choice out there for a true, honest person who knows what the hell's going on.
[00:49:27.841 --> 00:49:29.763]  He has a lot of neat things to say, Donald Trump.
[00:49:30.345 --> 00:49:43.428]  But I mean, saying, hey, veterans need help, or hey, we've got a problem with veterans, doesn't quite make me feel at ease as a veteran to think that you can take over the country and fix the problems that the other guys have already screwed up thus far.
[00:49:43.728 --> 00:49:52.530]  Well, Joe, I agree with you probably on 90% of stuff, but on this, I don't really disagree, but he's actually giving money that people are raising, and he's giving money
[00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:55.832]  Well, there's a lot of people out there that need help, veterans.
[00:49:55.852 --> 00:49:56.973]  Why don't you just give money to that?
[00:49:57.354 --> 00:50:04.439]  I mean, there's also, there's a lot of veteran programs out there that have been known to skim money and do a lot of fraudulent stuff.
[00:50:04.659 --> 00:50:08.342]  That's why I personally am very careful about who I do give money to.
[00:50:08.703 --> 00:50:15.768]  If I do want to help veterans out, I'm going to personally give to a group of veterans, not to a front who says they're doing it.
[00:50:15.848 --> 00:50:19.131]  Because nine times out of 10, that money's not going to make it to those guys.
[00:50:19.391 --> 00:50:19.571]  Yeah.
[00:50:21.225 --> 00:50:22.926]  Here's what I'm saying about the situation.
[00:50:24.327 --> 00:50:30.711]  They're persecuting at the VA under Obama and the globalists, the veterans, who Obama declared the number one enemy.
[00:50:31.311 --> 00:50:35.113]  So, all I'm saying is Obama says the number one enemy is returning veterans.
[00:50:35.414 --> 00:50:36.554]  They're trying to take their guns.
[00:50:36.895 --> 00:50:38.816]  And then Trump is at least saying put attention on it.
[00:50:39.176 --> 00:50:44.299]  I don't think he deserves to, you know, basically say he's exploiting veterans.
[00:50:45.199 --> 00:50:47.721]  Well, also too, it's definitely heavily scrutinized.
[00:50:48.183 --> 00:50:49.745]  Go ahead Joe, go ahead and make your point.
[00:50:49.765 --> 00:50:50.926]  Go ahead and make your point.
[00:50:50.946 --> 00:50:57.233]  I personally think he is, but also as well though too, he doesn't want states to own the land.
[00:50:57.373 --> 00:50:58.995]  He wants that to be federally done.
[00:50:59.818 --> 00:51:02.899]  So this guy kind of goes against a lot of the things a lot of us believe in.
[00:51:18.226 --> 00:51:24.610]  Trump, I mean, I agree with you there, but I mean, I just, I mean, just hearing like Trump and this whole thing, veterans, blah, blah, blah.
[00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:29.653]  I mean, he already told Fox and CNN, yeah, I'll come to your debates if you give money to the veterans.
[00:51:29.933 --> 00:51:32.274]  So I really think what he's doing is legitimate overall.
[00:51:33.875 --> 00:51:42.741]  I mean, I think he's got money that he can actually do something, go out and actually give veterans things, go to a VA, go to a hospital where there's people out there in wheelchairs who aren't being seen.
[00:51:42.761 --> 00:51:43.161]  He should do that.
[00:51:43.241 --> 00:51:44.942]  He should actually, that's a great idea for Trump.
[00:51:44.962 --> 00:51:46.363]  I'm going to tell his campaign, he should go.
[00:51:47.165 --> 00:51:53.595]  How about this though, I mean, in comparison to Rand Paul and Trump, Rand Paul I think wins all around.
[00:51:56.573 --> 00:52:01.755]  You know, Donald Trump's going to win the popularity vote because he's a, you know, reality TV show guy.
[00:52:01.775 --> 00:52:06.477]  He's got some hotels, you know, and that's an appealing thing because he goes against the grain.
[00:52:06.777 --> 00:52:09.498]  And I like the fact that he says stuff that pisses people off every day.
[00:52:09.858 --> 00:52:10.798]  I love that about him.
[00:52:11.118 --> 00:52:15.340]  But there's still some issues there with him that quite make me, I just, I'm not convinced.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.220]  I'm going to ask you this.
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:20.622]  Is he, is he, is he better than Hillary or, or, or Jeb Bush?
[00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:22.090]  Oh, of course!
[00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:26.011]  I mean, so is Dan Bilzerian and, like, some homeless guy that I just saw her sidewalk.
[00:52:26.031 --> 00:52:27.532]  Let's go back to what Trump's talking about.
[00:52:27.552 --> 00:52:29.613]  I don't feel good about turning down money.
[00:52:30.253 --> 00:52:32.974]  Because my whole life, I've been greedy, greedy, greedy!
[00:52:33.034 --> 00:52:35.414]  I've grabbed all the money I could get, I'm so greedy!
[00:52:35.434 --> 00:52:37.655]  Greedy, greedy, greedy!
[00:52:37.735 --> 00:52:38.695]  That's gonna be a meme.
[00:52:38.876 --> 00:52:42.277]  We gotta have a president that's greedy, greedy, greedy!
[00:52:42.357 --> 00:52:43.857]  I do respect the man's honesty.
[00:52:43.897 --> 00:52:46.438]  If I don't agree with everything he said, I expect he just...
[00:52:46.738 --> 00:52:49.901]  Can someone please turn that into a GIF right now?
[00:53:05.236 --> 00:53:09.999]  They have the back of my head with a massive crowd in front of me, and they're covering the story.
[00:53:10.599 --> 00:53:13.981]  And I said, I didn't even know they were doing the story, and it's the cover of Time.
[00:53:14.241 --> 00:53:15.462]  They're talking about the movement.
[00:53:15.542 --> 00:53:16.743]  It is actually a movement.
[00:53:17.163 --> 00:53:22.326]  But what's happened... Now that's actually what Bilderberg said about, is that he's creating a populist movement.
[00:53:23.227 --> 00:53:25.809]  I want to go back to David Knight and his take on this.
[00:53:25.949 --> 00:53:29.632]  Regardless, he's firing up populism ten times Ross Perot.
[00:53:30.012 --> 00:53:30.733]  That's frightening.
[00:53:30.773 --> 00:53:35.036]  Bilderberg, the big money Democrat and Republican, is going out against him.
[00:53:35.076 --> 00:53:42.042]  That's why I, months ago, had to say, I've got to start at least supporting Trump because he's a figurehead of a populist movement.
[00:53:42.102 --> 00:53:43.143]  If he betrays us,
[00:53:43.723 --> 00:53:51.093]  It'll be over the top, but at the same time, the Liberty Movement needs to get in on this because, you know, we know the Republican establishment's bad.
[00:53:51.113 --> 00:53:52.995]  Look, I'm a smart political analyst.
[00:53:53.676 --> 00:53:55.578]  The Bundys didn't listen to me, look where they are now.
[00:53:56.259 --> 00:54:00.444]  And so, I'm not trying to sell my own crew completely on this, because I wasn't completely sold.
[00:54:01.286 --> 00:54:03.468]  I mean, look, I was invited to meet Bush.
[00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:04.810]  I didn't go sell out to him.
[00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:07.994]  I was invited to meet Clinton when I was on two radio stations.
[00:54:08.014 --> 00:54:10.597]  I've never really said all this before, but I'm saying it now.
[00:54:10.997 --> 00:54:12.940]  I mean, I've already been invited by the big guys.
[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:13.881]  I didn't go meet with them.
[00:54:14.441 --> 00:54:15.803]  I've done this with Trump because...
[00:54:16.864 --> 00:54:19.946]  My gut tells me that there's a chance that we can make him ours.
[00:54:20.326 --> 00:54:21.467]  And I don't think he's evil.
[00:54:21.867 --> 00:54:25.449]  I think he's a big, powerful guy that wants to be George Washington 2.0.
[00:54:25.769 --> 00:54:27.931]  I don't think he knows exactly who George Washington is.
[00:54:28.191 --> 00:54:30.372]  I said, you know, isn't George Washington the greatest person ever?
[00:54:30.392 --> 00:54:31.733]  And he goes, well, that's what they say.
[00:54:31.773 --> 00:54:32.373]  Let's move on.
[00:54:32.774 --> 00:54:34.555]  You know, because, you know, whatever.
[00:54:34.595 --> 00:54:36.936]  The point is, is that that's my view.
[00:54:37.296 --> 00:54:38.817]  So he's the best shot we've got.
[00:54:39.437 --> 00:54:41.519]  I like Rand Paul too, but I can't be the purest.
[00:54:42.199 --> 00:54:47.664]  I don't think he's a puppet by any means, but once he gets in office is he really going to fight for the right?
[00:55:08.021 --> 00:55:10.842]  If he screws us over once he's in office, I'll go after him.
[00:55:10.922 --> 00:55:11.962]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:55:11.982 --> 00:55:14.563]  And I think if they blow his plane up or something, everybody's going to be eating crow.
[00:55:14.984 --> 00:55:15.244]  Yeah.
[00:55:15.364 --> 00:55:17.644]  Let me tell you, he's probably, I think he's for real.
[00:55:18.205 --> 00:55:18.845]  I'm pretty sure.
[00:55:19.405 --> 00:55:21.826]  He may be for real trying to take over from the new world order for himself.
[00:55:22.906 --> 00:55:24.887]  All I know is he's got him crapping her pants, Sha'Carri.
[00:55:25.067 --> 00:55:25.988]  Let's go to David Knight.
[00:55:26.228 --> 00:55:27.528]  I'm betting on Trump, folks.
[00:55:28.068 --> 00:55:28.388]  All right.
[00:55:28.889 --> 00:55:30.029]  Ace of spades is a Trump.
[00:55:30.089 --> 00:55:31.049]  Royal flush right there.
[00:55:31.449 --> 00:55:32.030]  Pun intended.
[00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:35.331]  Let's go ahead and go and see what David Knight has to say.
[00:55:36.414 --> 00:55:42.823]  Well, you know, Alex, in terms of what you're talking about, I gotta say, you know, I look at different aspects of my personality.
[00:55:42.963 --> 00:55:50.373]  The anarchist in me likes Trump, because I just want to say, let's just burn this thing down and give the system the finger, right?
[00:55:51.414 --> 00:55:52.894]  There certainly is an aspect of that.
[00:55:53.054 --> 00:55:55.755]  There's also the nationalism, the populism.
[00:55:55.815 --> 00:56:00.616]  Remember Ross Perot when he was running and he was running against NAFTA and he was talking about that?
[00:56:00.996 --> 00:56:16.340]  Now we have a situation where you've got another outsider who is on the scene at the time that they're trying to do the next level of economic consolidation which will eventually become a sovereignty grabbing consolidations we've seen with the European Union.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.521]  So that is something that I think really concerns
[00:56:20.001 --> 00:56:25.185]  The elites at Davos, they're talking about how the specter of Donald Trump was haunting them there.
[00:56:25.625 --> 00:56:27.967]  So, yeah, I don't think that he's on board with them.
[00:56:28.988 --> 00:56:30.549]  He may share some common goals with them.
[00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:35.632]  They may think that they might be able to get him to do what they want if they can make a deal with him.
[00:56:35.753 --> 00:56:37.234]  I mean, certainly he's up for deals.
[00:56:37.334 --> 00:56:38.795]  Oh, look, he just brought up Huckabee.
[00:56:39.315 --> 00:56:41.076]  The word is Huckabee may endorse him very soon.
[00:56:41.096 --> 00:56:42.497]  He'll be part of this event tonight.
[00:56:43.058 --> 00:56:43.418]  I hear you.
[00:56:43.458 --> 00:56:44.859]  We just know Hillary's bad.
[00:56:45.119 --> 00:56:46.000]  We know the others are bad.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.662]  I'm not even saying fix everything at the federal level.
[00:56:48.922 --> 00:56:52.244]  Well, I think Huckabee and Santorum are both at that event right now offstage.
[00:56:52.284 --> 00:56:53.745]  Yeah, they both just stood up there.
[00:56:53.785 --> 00:56:57.608]  Yeah, they're there and that's... Oh no, we had Stone on at 2 o'clock.
[00:56:57.868 --> 00:56:58.569]  Well, that's important.
[00:56:58.649 --> 00:57:00.490]  And he just talked to Trump and said they're going to be there, yeah.
[00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:04.433]  Well, that's important because a lot of the evangelicals were going for Huckabee.
[00:57:04.453 --> 00:57:05.393]  They're bringing Huckabee up.
[00:57:05.433 --> 00:57:06.554]  Let's put him on.
[00:57:06.634 --> 00:57:07.314]  Let's put Huckabee on.
[00:57:07.334 --> 00:57:08.155]  We'll come right back to you.
[00:57:12.658 --> 00:57:13.659]  And Mrs. Huckabee?
[00:57:15.057 --> 00:57:15.858]  And Rick's daughter?
[00:57:15.878 --> 00:57:17.079]  I don't like Santorum.
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:19.342]  But Iowa does.
[00:57:19.462 --> 00:57:21.304]  Both of these guys won in Iowa before.
[00:57:21.344 --> 00:57:22.726]  No, you're absolutely right.
[00:57:22.746 --> 00:57:23.687]  Yeah, they both won in Iowa.
[00:57:23.887 --> 00:57:29.693]  And the evangelicals like Huckabee, which they're also kind of swinging for Cruz as well.
[00:57:29.713 --> 00:57:31.055]  So these two people do nothing.
[00:57:31.095 --> 00:57:32.036]  They would never, ever.
[00:57:32.056 --> 00:57:33.036]  I never have done a thing like that.
[00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:37.098]  But when you see deals that are so bad, believe me, they're not bad for the politician.
[00:57:37.338 --> 00:57:40.679]  They're bad for the country, and that's why I don't take anything.
[00:57:40.939 --> 00:57:41.899]  I don't take anything.
[00:57:41.959 --> 00:57:43.320]  That's where Trump's going the right way now.
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:44.600]  He's saying this.
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:46.261]  Now, they're not dumb, they're robbing you.
[00:57:46.321 --> 00:57:46.581]  Whoa.
[00:57:46.801 --> 00:57:47.321]  That was new.
[00:57:47.782 --> 00:57:50.462]  And I actually sent the message to Trump, stop saying they were dumb.
[00:57:50.502 --> 00:57:51.803]  You did really well, these two.
[00:57:52.503 --> 00:57:53.283]  And who the hell knows?
[00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.904]  That they're making bad deals because they're dumb.
[00:57:54.944 --> 00:57:55.484]  No, they're screwing us.
[00:57:55.504 --> 00:57:56.144]  I said, how did they do?
[00:57:56.164 --> 00:57:56.945]  He just, whoa.
[00:57:56.965 --> 00:57:58.945]  I think if you did poorly, you probably wouldn't be here right now.
[00:57:58.985 --> 00:58:00.346]  You'd go back, you'd be depressed, right?
[00:58:00.566 --> 00:58:02.210]  You guys know Trump listens to the show, that's not bull.
[00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:04.074]  Say a few words, Mike, say a few words, we'd love it.
[00:58:04.154 --> 00:58:04.395]  Come on.
[00:58:04.435 --> 00:58:05.517]  Thank you so much.
[00:58:05.537 --> 00:58:07.702]  It's kind of hard to listen to a show and not start waving up.
[00:58:10.476 --> 00:58:11.037]  Look at this.
[00:58:11.057 --> 00:58:12.117]  Look at this spectacle.
[00:58:12.157 --> 00:58:13.838]  They've taken over the media.
[00:58:13.879 --> 00:58:14.999]  They've taken over the media.
[00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:16.680]  We have our own feed there as well.
[00:58:17.021 --> 00:58:17.661]  We're carrying C-SPAN.
[00:58:17.681 --> 00:58:18.962]  Look at this spectacle.
[00:58:19.202 --> 00:58:20.263]  We're taking over the media.
[00:58:20.283 --> 00:58:22.104]  I'm supporting another candidate for president.
[00:58:22.304 --> 00:58:23.485]  Well, yeah, we're leading that.
[00:58:23.525 --> 00:58:25.026]  More folks are going to get involved.
[00:58:25.046 --> 00:58:28.369]  I want folks to get so successful at this that we become obsolete.
[00:58:28.449 --> 00:58:29.209]  I'm a pundit.
[00:58:29.229 --> 00:58:29.730]  You're a pundit.
[00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:32.211]  We have an operation, but it's not like up to us to do everything.
[00:58:32.231 --> 00:58:33.392]  We work eight hours and go home.
[00:58:34.073 --> 00:58:35.454]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.
[00:58:35.594 --> 00:58:39.797]  I'm Jakari Jackson from the Central Texas Command Center, and we'll see you again next week.
[00:58:48.823 --> 00:58:49.964]  Knockout is back.
[00:58:50.304 --> 00:59:01.411]  If you want a product that has 10 known ingredients that naturally get your body to relax, your brain to relax, so you get deep restful sleep, Knockout's it.
[00:59:01.831 --> 00:59:03.532]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:03.993 --> 00:59:13.158]  L-theanine, hops flower extract, lemon balm extract, valerian root extract, chamomile flower extract, L-tryptophan extract, melatonin, and more.
[00:59:13.539 --> 00:59:15.320]  All organic, all the natural sources.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.761]  It's the same price
[00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:23.364]  As leading brands of melatonin that are three milligrams a piece, it has three milligram, the standard recommended dose for an adult.
[00:59:23.904 --> 00:59:30.148]  It's got the GABA, so it would probably cost $50 to take all this as separate pills.
[00:59:30.648 --> 00:59:30.768]  It's $19.95.
[00:59:31.488 --> 00:59:33.830]  You take one or two of these,
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:38.213]  And it just is really clean restful sleep is what the reviews are.
[00:59:38.554 --> 00:59:42.477]  It's what I've experienced and it just synergistically puts everything in there.
