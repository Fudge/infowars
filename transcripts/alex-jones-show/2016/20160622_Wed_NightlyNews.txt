[00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:22.175]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.296 --> 00:00:23.658]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:25.683]  It is June 22, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.837 --> 00:00:35.860]  Tonight, the New Republic says Trump's speech sounded like an InfoWars article?
[00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:36.541]  Yep.
[00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:40.344]  Hard-hitting, pulled no punches, and he backed up what he said.
[00:00:40.684 --> 00:00:44.207]  She gets rich making you poor.
[00:00:44.687 --> 00:00:54.776]  These funds were paid to the Clinton's bank account directly while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.
[00:00:55.276 --> 00:01:04.241]  Then, Congressional Democrats holding a sit-in, while a marshmallow lefty blogger whines that an AR-15 bruised his shoulder.
[00:01:06.122 --> 00:01:09.523]  And the vote on whether Britain will leave the European Union will be held tomorrow.
[00:01:09.763 --> 00:01:17.087]  Lord Monckton explains why Brexit is part of the movement against the globalist's efforts to eradicate democracies worldwide.
[00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:20.329]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.432]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com with an extremely important message.
[00:01:55.933 --> 00:02:00.916]  You're probably asking yourself right now, what's the most important phrase in America right now?
[00:02:01.456 --> 00:02:03.658]  Well, it happens to be Hillary for prison.
[00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:07.420]  Get your Hillary for prison t-shirt today at the InfoWars store for $9.95.
[00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:10.482]  That's half of what it used to be at $19.95.
[00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:12.904]  Why do you want to get this?
[00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:15.485]  Why should you buy this for you and your friends and family?
[00:02:15.826 --> 00:02:18.968]  Because number one, it's a great conversation starter, and number two,
[00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:24.212]  Hell, you get to trigger a whole lot of crazy liberal commie bastards, and that's what I like to do.
[00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:31.778]  And maybe you're just at work right now, and it's casual shirt Friday, and one of your hipster buddies walks in with a Hillary Clinton shirt saying, I'm with her.
[00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:32.599]  Negative!
[00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:33.360]  This is what you're gonna do.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:42.227]  You're gonna stand up and go, UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:50.447]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get your Hillary for Prison shirt today for $9.95 and trigger more assholes like him.
[00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.270]  Come on, Hillary.
[00:02:53.471 --> 00:02:54.051]  Just a little.
[00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:55.132]  Just a little sip.
[00:02:55.693 --> 00:02:55.993]  Open up.
[00:02:56.314 --> 00:02:57.215]  Come on, take it!
[00:02:57.695 --> 00:02:58.076]  Take it!
[00:03:02.594 --> 00:03:06.678]  Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be.
[00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:13.706]  But we can't solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created the problems themselves.
[00:03:14.387 --> 00:03:21.975]  We'll never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who have rigged it in the first place.
[00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:30.349]  And that was just one of the snippets from Donald Trump's speech today.
[00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:35.955]  Now, it was a few weeks ago he promised that he was going to come after Hillary, and at the time he said it would be around then.
[00:03:35.995 --> 00:03:38.237]  But it seems like now is the time for Mr. Trump.
[00:03:38.257 --> 00:03:40.359]  He's coming out guns blazing, if you will.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.864]  And it's getting to the point where people are talking all about this speech, different parts of it.
[00:03:45.164 --> 00:03:48.408]  But my favorite article, David Knight gave this to me a little bit earlier.
[00:03:48.908 --> 00:03:57.753]  Donald Trump just gave his most presidential speech, and it still sounded like an InfoWars article, which I thought was quite the laugh there.
[00:03:58.193 --> 00:04:00.895]  Now, in the speech, he said many things.
[00:04:00.935 --> 00:04:05.778]  He also said Mrs. Clinton was corrupt and rigged, and he got a good line in.
[00:04:05.818 --> 00:04:07.959]  This is their words on The New Republic.
[00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:10.821]  Hillary Clinton got rich making you poor.
[00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:14.284]  So this is what they decided to point out about Mr. Trump's speech.
[00:04:14.644 --> 00:04:18.907]  And they say Trump's case was riddled with lies, BS, and conspiracy theories.
[00:04:19.268 --> 00:04:23.491]  He relied heavily on one widely discredited book, Clinton Cash.
[00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:28.135]  Now, I haven't personally read the Clinton Cash, so I can't really speak to its validity.
[00:04:28.575 --> 00:04:32.038]  But the issue is, anything that they don't like is discredited.
[00:04:32.418 --> 00:04:34.419]  And I was talking to one of the guys in the back.
[00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:57.967]  He was saying that his friend hates Infowars, hates Donald Trump, and once again, I'm not a Trump guy, but they hate everything we stand for, but they love Mrs. Clinton, but they get all their news from CBS, which I thought was really funny because if you just go to the CBS thing, you see these big banners, I'm with her, I love Hillary, you know, everything's about Hillary Clinton, you know, hugging puppy dogs and, you know, handing out cake to poor kids and all that stuff.
[00:04:58.627 --> 00:05:03.171]  But the issue is, if you go back to the archives of CBS, they have this great thing.
[00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:05.133]  I think it was Cheryl Atkinson, as a matter of fact.
[00:05:05.494 --> 00:05:10.578]  Mrs. Clinton, when she was in Bosnia, saying that she was dodging sniper fire.
[00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:12.901]  And Trump mentioned that in his speech today as well.
[00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:18.746]  This person who wants you to trust them to run the free world throws out this whopper of a lie.
[00:05:19.847 --> 00:05:24.448]  You know, some itty-bitty thing, like, slightly out of proportion, slightly sensationalized.
[00:05:24.468 --> 00:05:29.869]  She took an event that never happened, just like Lyon, Bryan, Williams, and said, oh, we were dodging sniper fire.
[00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:35.331]  And if you go back and watch those videos, she stops and she gets flowers and she's signing autographs for little girls.
[00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:38.651]  Then it goes way beyond that, the reason why I don't like Hillary Clinton.
[00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:40.332]  Also, when you talk about Benghazi.
[00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:44.209]  And they try to downplay, downplay, downplay Benghazi.
[00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.632]  This is my argument to people.
[00:05:45.973 --> 00:05:48.337]  Let's say that the email scandal is completely overblown.
[00:05:48.377 --> 00:05:49.580]  Other people do it, whatever else.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.842]  It shouldn't be that big of a deal.
[00:05:51.368 --> 00:05:56.832]  I'll take that argument, but at the same time Benghazi has been greatly underplayed.
[00:05:57.192 --> 00:06:10.262]  Because if you look at the situation with Ambassador Stevens, they want to tell you that it was some anti-Muslim film that was basically like a live action version of South Park that set people off and they decided to go burn down the Benghazi consulate.
[00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:14.105]  Well, if you read the cable sent by Ambassador Stevens months
[00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:20.049]  Before he was actually murdered, he was sending these cables, hey, I feel unsafe here, we need more security.
[00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:23.131]  And what they do, they responded by giving him less security.
[00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:27.994]  So those are things I don't like about Mrs. Clinton going back through her history.
[00:06:28.034 --> 00:06:33.898]  It's not anything cosmetic like she wears pantsuits or anything that they want to spin off on that.
[00:06:34.358 --> 00:06:36.740]  And it's not just that where they're talking about Hillary Clinton.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:44.866]  Now people are taking exception to a great piece of marketing, I guess you could say, the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:49.190]  And they're coming after the t-shirt here in Slate.
[00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.132]  And they're talking about the story of a professional poker player and a contestant on Survivor.
[00:06:54.232 --> 00:07:10.878]  Survivor was standing at the entrance, this is in Vegas, to one of the Trump's speech, and she was wearing a Hillary for Prison t-shirt 2016 and they were just so shocked and offended and triggered and all the rest of it because she had a Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:15.421]  You have a right to wear what kind of t-shirt you want and this is my argument with that.
[00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:27.831]  If you could say that Trump is Hitler and Ted Cruz is a Zodiac killer and you can say Bernie Sanders is Colonel Sanders and all the other memes that are out there with all the other presidential contenders that you know have since dropped off.
[00:07:28.191 --> 00:07:33.074]  But regardless, if you can make fun of those people, why can't you say that Mrs. Clinton should go to prison?
[00:07:33.434 --> 00:07:34.835]  And I think that's just a great way.
[00:07:34.895 --> 00:07:35.615]  Thank you so much.
[00:07:36.036 --> 00:07:36.396]  What is this?
[00:07:36.636 --> 00:07:38.117]  Slate for hyping up the shirt?
[00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:43.039]  And it just so happens that we're running a special in the shirt right now at the InfoWars shop.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:49.183]  You can get yourself a great Hillary for Prison t-shirt and you get the second one for 75% off.
[00:07:49.263 --> 00:07:50.464]  It's a limited time deal.
[00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.385]  It's a great way to meet like
[00:07:52.825 --> 00:08:01.029]  Minded people, you can make Slate mad, and you can be the star of the show for just showing up with your Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:08:01.049 --> 00:08:03.071]  You can get the official InfoWars one.
[00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:10.274]  There are other, you know, third-party ones, but you can get our official one at the InfoWars shop, and it's a great way to piss off a liberal.
[00:08:10.294 --> 00:08:12.656]  So get your Hillary for Prison t-shirt today.
[00:08:13.547 --> 00:08:16.109]  All right, now let's move on to some other news, some more serious news.
[00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:18.951]  As we talk about things, the DOJ does.
[00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:26.717]  Now, a lot of times when I speak about the DOJ, it's usually not in the most polite ways, whether it's, you know, Fast and Furious, many other scandals as well.
[00:08:27.098 --> 00:08:27.838]  But now we see this.
[00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:33.423]  DOJ touts 90 million Medicare fraud takedown, the largest ever.
[00:08:33.923 --> 00:08:39.608]  The government says 300 people have been charged this year in health care fraud sweeps across the country.
[00:08:40.168 --> 00:08:46.395]  That includes physicians, clinic owners, and other healthcare professionals accused of bilking Medicare.
[00:08:57.828 --> 00:09:00.689]  More than 55 million people receive Medicare.
[00:09:00.729 --> 00:09:04.311]  So just as we see here, nothing is immune to corruption.
[00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:05.932]  People can take advantage of the system.
[00:09:05.972 --> 00:09:07.433]  They can gain the system.
[00:09:07.453 --> 00:09:13.015]  Like they said, the people here were clinic owners and doctors and other people who participated in this fraud.
[00:09:13.055 --> 00:09:16.417]  So when you go to the hospital and you think you're getting the best deal and they're trying to help you out,
[00:09:16.897 --> 00:09:17.917]  I'm sure most of them are.
[00:09:18.038 --> 00:09:18.578]  I will say that.
[00:09:18.618 --> 00:09:20.319]  I'm sure most of them have the best of intentions.
[00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:23.660]  But you do have those who game the system and they try to steal from you.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:29.342]  And it's, as I've heard it described by many people, it's really not health care, it's sick care.
[00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:36.686]  Because if you think about this, once again, your doctors, nurses, people in the medical field have the best of intentions.
[00:09:36.986 --> 00:09:41.108]  I'm talking about the trickle down effect of the people who actually make the drugs or do the procedures.
[00:09:43.164 --> 00:09:47.426]  Regulate the procedures, I guess, is more of what I was getting at there.
[00:09:47.586 --> 00:09:54.708]  Hypothetically, let's say you can cure somebody of a disease in three years, or you can treat them for 30 years, or until they die.
[00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:56.889]  Which of those has more money in it?
[00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.670]  You bilked the system, as it were.
[00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.072]  There's no money in curing somebody when you can treat them for a lifetime.
[00:10:05.192 --> 00:10:08.293]  But they say that's a conspiracy theory, so you believe what you want.
[00:10:08.793 --> 00:10:09.934]  I think there are definitely ways.
[00:10:10.945 --> 00:10:15.848]  Out there that are not the traditional westernized medicine when it comes to getting yourself better.
[00:10:16.688 --> 00:10:20.571]  Now, let's talk about getting something better and that is the reputation of the AR-15.
[00:10:20.691 --> 00:10:22.592]  It has been demonized.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.722]  Unmercifully, since Orlando.
[00:10:27.742 --> 00:10:36.029]  But if you go back to previous shootings here in fairly recent American history, people have actually used the AR-15, but it was not used in Orlando.
[00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:42.694]  And because it looks similar enough to an AR-15, to the layman, they keep saying it's an AR-15, it's an AR-15.
[00:10:43.114 --> 00:10:48.898]  So much to the point that liberals are actually going out and shooting these guns and saying how traumatized they are by it.
[00:10:49.319 --> 00:10:51.400]  Now, real quick, this is just something off the top of my head.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.362]  I remember when Pierce Morgan came down here
[00:10:53.982 --> 00:10:55.142]  I was at 2012-2013.
[00:10:55.162 --> 00:10:59.683]  You know, a lot of us in the crew, we went down there to see him at Houston.
[00:10:59.703 --> 00:11:01.264]  He had that conversation with Alex.
[00:11:02.144 --> 00:11:04.264]  And he's shooting a fully automatic gun.
[00:11:04.324 --> 00:11:07.605]  And you can see clearly in the video that he is trying not to smile.
[00:11:07.665 --> 00:11:09.886]  He's having a great time shooting all these guns.
[00:11:09.906 --> 00:11:12.686]  You know, probably went out and had some, you know, barbecue afterwards.
[00:11:12.726 --> 00:11:15.067]  Got some Spurs and a cowboy hat and a whole nine.
[00:11:15.107 --> 00:11:19.488]  But he wants to say that, you know, you shouldn't really have these killing machines.
[00:11:20.268 --> 00:11:22.789]  But specifically, I want to mention somebody.
[00:11:23.729 --> 00:11:24.410]  Hi, my name is Chris Waller.
[00:11:51.707 --> 00:11:55.309]  I'm making this video in response to Mr. Kuntzman's article, which I'm going to link with the video.
[00:11:55.849 --> 00:12:01.092]  In the article, he said shooting the AR-15 was terrifying, caused a case of PTSD, and bruised his shoulder.
[00:12:01.672 --> 00:12:08.095]  Now, as I'm about to demonstrate, the recoil on this rifle cannot cause bruising on your shoulder, even if held improperly.
[00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:11.457]  Let me put my ear protection in real quick, and we will demonstrate.
[00:12:11.477 --> 00:12:18.360]  I'm going to fire this weapon off the tip of my nose.
[00:12:32.344 --> 00:12:34.805]  Not broken, not bleeding, not bruised.
[00:12:35.486 --> 00:12:36.126]  Thank you for your time.
[00:12:36.826 --> 00:12:47.472]  Now earlier this week we brought you the news how many gun control bills failed and now they're actually having a sit-in to bring attention to gun control and this is being led by Congressman John Lewis.
[00:12:47.972 --> 00:12:51.294]  It says sometimes you have to do something that's out of the ordinary.
[00:12:51.494 --> 00:12:53.996]  Sometimes you have to make a way out of no way.
[00:12:54.736 --> 00:13:04.001]  And basically they say that they started chanting, I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired and no bill and no break while they were out there protesting the failure of the gun bills.
[00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:12.186]  Now I'm sure if you went out and talked to all these people individually, you'll get different answers as to what they think is the best answer to gun violence in this country.
[00:13:13.106 --> 00:13:14.306]  This is what I always tell people.
[00:13:14.486 --> 00:13:16.987]  They say, well, how can you be for all the gun violence in the country?
[00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:19.307]  I'm not for gun violence in the country.
[00:13:19.608 --> 00:13:21.388]  I'm not for liquor store robberies.
[00:13:21.428 --> 00:13:23.989]  Joe Biggs is not for shooting up a school.
[00:13:24.029 --> 00:13:26.069]  Alex Jones is not for bank robberies.
[00:13:26.109 --> 00:13:29.590]  Nobody is touting gun violence as the way to go.
[00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.770]  We support self-defense.
[00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.331]  We support the Second Amendment.
[00:13:33.351 --> 00:13:35.211]  We support the right to bear arms.
[00:13:35.411 --> 00:13:39.212]  As I always say, the shotgun in my closet has never shot anybody, and I hope it never will.
[00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:41.133]  It's there in case I need it.
[00:13:41.513 --> 00:13:42.453]  Now, with that said,
[00:13:44.093 --> 00:13:54.087]  These people have to understand that with the bills that they are trying to pass here recently, which one of those would have passed, if passed, would have stopped the recent shooting in Orlando.
[00:13:54.347 --> 00:13:59.133]  Because you're talking about a guy who went through the background check system, you know, he had been
[00:13:59.614 --> 00:13:59.874]  I don't
[00:14:17.671 --> 00:14:19.993]  Any of that stopped the shooting that took place.
[00:14:20.434 --> 00:14:21.675]  The background checks wouldn't have done it.
[00:14:21.715 --> 00:14:25.258]  Banning assault weapons that are already banned, that wouldn't have done anything.
[00:14:25.318 --> 00:14:31.845]  I just don't understand the logic of the people who keep saying we need to ban things like Hillary coming out and banning sniper rifles.
[00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:33.947]  The guy didn't use a sniper rifle.
[00:14:34.007 --> 00:14:35.188]  It's obvious if you look at it.
[00:14:35.468 --> 00:14:36.389]  That's not what it is.
[00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:40.914]  So people keep trying to pass things that would have done nothing to stop that shooting.
[00:14:41.574 --> 00:14:56.086]  You need to look at other aspects as to what motivated the guy in the first place, not saying that because this guy owned a gun that looks similar to an AR-15, we have to take an AR-15 from everybody else, the millions of other people who own them and have had no incident with them.
[00:14:56.206 --> 00:14:57.548]  It makes absolutely no sense.
[00:14:57.908 --> 00:14:58.568]  As I always say...
[00:14:59.429 --> 00:15:02.971]  It's easy to ban something you don't own or an activity that you don't participate in.
[00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:05.012]  I always give the example, I don't drink.
[00:15:05.292 --> 00:15:07.173]  I could say, let's ban alcohol tomorrow.
[00:15:07.513 --> 00:15:11.915]  Everybody else would say, well, let's not do that because we had an alcohol prohibition and that didn't work out.
[00:15:12.175 --> 00:15:13.536]  And I would say you're exactly right.
[00:15:13.896 --> 00:15:16.797]  You had people, violent crime shot up, shot up overnight.
[00:15:17.097 --> 00:15:21.359]  You had other things going on, bootleggers, you know, the speakeasies and all that.
[00:15:21.479 --> 00:15:23.380]  It wasn't a very effective way to go about it.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.342]  The same thing is going to happen if you come out and just blanket ban all the firearms.
[00:15:27.702 --> 00:15:39.069]  And as we were talking about Congressman John Lewis there, I really think the guy should take a look at his own personal life when you come to these background checks and saying if you have no fly, you have no buy.
[00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.731]  Because he's actually on the no fly list.
[00:15:41.771 --> 00:15:43.652]  And this is a United States Congressman.
[00:15:44.033 --> 00:15:49.196]  He reports that he had been denied access to an airplane at least 35 times.
[00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:51.097]  And this is a Congressman.
[00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:54.679]  Like I said, we talk about the kids and the other people who have similar names.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.661]  To actual suspected terrorists.
[00:15:57.921 --> 00:16:03.283]  This guy's a congressman and he has to call his office and show his press ID or his national ID or whatever else.
[00:16:03.663 --> 00:16:06.024]  And he says, hey, I'm not this guy you think I am.
[00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:07.104]  And they still deny him.
[00:16:07.504 --> 00:16:12.146]  So how much more would somebody who doesn't have those credentials have to go through these type of experiences?
[00:16:12.586 --> 00:16:16.228]  And the United States government doesn't pay for me to get on an airplane and fly around.
[00:16:16.468 --> 00:16:18.448]  This guy could just, you know, charge it to the state.
[00:16:18.548 --> 00:16:20.669]  Everybody else, you have to eat the cost of that ticket.
[00:16:20.769 --> 00:16:22.530]  This is definitely not something that you want to
[00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:28.014]  Roll out blanket with this no fly, no do anything else until that system is fixed.
[00:16:28.495 --> 00:16:36.621]  And as we're talking about guns and all the gun violence and what would have stopped this or what wouldn't have, let's take a look at the guy who tried to assassinate Donald Trump.
[00:16:36.901 --> 00:16:44.447]  And even the Washington Post is coming out and saying, why isn't the assassination attempt of a United States presidential contender bigger news?
[00:16:45.268 --> 00:16:58.574]  Well, that makes a very good point there, Washington Post, because when you consider the guy, his name was Michael Stanford, or Sanford is Michael Sanford, he's a 20-year-old British citizen who was in the United States illegally overstaying his visa.
[00:16:59.014 --> 00:17:07.377]  He also allegedly, allegedly in quotes, that's my emphasis, tried to pull a gun from the holster of a police officer at a Trump rally in Las Vegas.
[00:17:09.113 --> 00:17:17.979]  You have a guy, he's here illegally, he's not of age to own a pistol, he has to be 21, and he tried to steal one from a police officer.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:27.866]  So, I don't know how many crimes a guy has to commit before, even if he had got the gun, right, and he tried to aim it, before he pulled the trigger he committed what, what was that, four crimes right there?
[00:17:29.387 --> 00:17:31.088]  I don't know how much more...
[00:17:31.969 --> 00:17:33.070]  Blatant you can be from this.
[00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.351]  A background check wouldn't have stopped this guy.
[00:17:35.411 --> 00:17:38.132]  Banning assault weapons wouldn't have stopped this guy.
[00:17:38.332 --> 00:17:41.694]  Ammunition shortages in your magazine, that wouldn't have stopped this guy.
[00:17:41.774 --> 00:17:50.398]  All these things that people are trying to pass wouldn't have stopped this guy because if you really want to hurt somebody, he got to the point where he is willing to steal a firearm from a police officer.
[00:17:50.678 --> 00:17:54.519]  But he builds robots in his spare time so that's okay and it shouldn't be a big deal.
[00:17:54.859 --> 00:18:01.520]  Now let's talk quickly about the Senate and their attempts to give the FBI access to your browsing histories without a court order.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:12.682]  It says privacy minded senators on Wednesday blocked an amendment that would have given the FBI power to your internet records including browsing histories and email metadata without a court order.
[00:18:12.722 --> 00:18:15.263]  That's called the Fourth Amendment and you guys should definitely look that up.
[00:18:15.683 --> 00:18:20.207]  And finally, this is something that has got some news, but I think it needs more attention.
[00:18:20.627 --> 00:18:30.456]  This is a Yazidi woman, and she was held captive by ISIS, and she's saying that these guys definitely need to be put in check for their actions, and she actually testified in front of Congress.
[00:18:30.736 --> 00:18:32.157]  And these type of things happen regularly.
[00:18:32.217 --> 00:18:37.842]  Not always, you know, people coming from foreign countries, but people who have been wronged, sexually abused, or whatever.
[00:18:37.902 --> 00:18:39.243]  These are great things that you need to watch.
[00:18:39.263 --> 00:18:40.404]  They're very educational.
[00:18:40.424 --> 00:18:43.207]  I definitely encourage you to go watch them in your spare time.
[00:18:43.507 --> 00:18:44.487]  Well, that's it for this segment.
[00:18:44.507 --> 00:18:47.048]  Stay tuned after this break for more special reports.
[00:19:04.891 --> 00:19:09.311]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.432 --> 00:19:12.032]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:15.769]  And to look at that threat, we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:27.192]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type one civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.852 --> 00:19:39.214]  You can say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.742 --> 00:19:50.145]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:53.818]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2, Survival Shield, at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:23:06.564 --> 00:23:19.390]  Three Syrian refugees reportedly raped a little girl at Knife Point in Idaho before urinating on her body, an incident that prompted furious residents to accuse Twin Falls City Council members of covering up the assault.
[00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:28.995]  The sexual assault allegedly took place on June 2nd, but has received virtually no media attention aside from one vague KMVT report.
[00:23:29.255 --> 00:23:42.143]  However, residents have been circulating what really happened on social media, with the Creeping Sharia Blog reporting that the victim was a young girl who was born premature and is less developed for her age.
[00:23:42.503 --> 00:23:47.186]  The victim's grandmother found the victim and then called the girl's mother who called the police.
[00:23:47.406 --> 00:23:54.891]  The police took two and a half hours to arrive but were unable to take any action due to the language barrier.
[00:23:55.251 --> 00:24:04.835]  When she arrived, the mother of the alleged rapist was only able to say, no police, while the father reportedly congratulated his 13-year-old son.
[00:24:05.175 --> 00:24:08.857]  Video of the entire assault was captured on the boy's cell phone.
[00:24:09.097 --> 00:24:19.461]  But according to the Idaho Statesman, the Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loeb says there were no Syrians involved, there was no knife involved, and there was no gang rape.
[00:24:19.801 --> 00:24:30.105]  Loeb continued, there is a small group of people in Twin Falls County whose life goal is to eliminate refugees and thus far they have not been constrained by the truth.
[00:24:30.365 --> 00:24:36.488]  They have not been constrained by the truth in the past and I don't expect them to be constrained by the truth in the future.
[00:24:36.728 --> 00:24:37.048]  Truth.
[00:24:37.408 --> 00:24:47.112]  These supposed city leaders would have the good people of Twin Falls believe there isn't any invasion of psychotic refugees gradually flooding the United States
[00:24:47.412 --> 00:24:50.774]  That will soon resemble the horror transpiring in Europe.
[00:24:51.034 --> 00:24:53.075]  Just listen to your elected leaders.
[00:24:53.275 --> 00:24:54.716]  They know best, right?
[00:24:55.076 --> 00:24:58.078]  Well... So the first item is general public input.
[00:24:58.118 --> 00:25:05.062]  If there is anyone here from the public who wishes to address the council on an issue that is not on tonight's agenda, now is your chance to please come forward.
[00:25:05.402 --> 00:25:11.146]  We've been made aware of a situation, an alleged assault of a minor child.
[00:25:12.166 --> 00:25:14.527]  And, uh, we can't get any information on it.
[00:25:14.647 --> 00:25:32.170]  Apparently, it's been indicated that it was, uh, the perpetrators were four Muslim youth that, uh, conducted this, uh, I guess it was rape, and we've heard that it's consensual, but my concern is there's no such thing as consensual rape of a minor.
[00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:40.332]  I am telling you, I am not aware of a news story about allegations of an assault against a minor in our community by Islamists.
[00:25:40.732 --> 00:25:50.979]  Idaho's First News has confirmed that a reported sexual assault around the Fawnbrook Apartments in Twin Falls is being investigated by the Twin Falls Police Department.
[00:25:51.399 --> 00:25:53.500]  The incident allegedly occurred on June 2nd.
[00:25:53.921 --> 00:26:03.327]  Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Lopes has confirmed the investigation but says there will be no charges filed in the case until the investigation is complete.
[00:26:03.847 --> 00:26:09.831]  Unconfirmed reports concerning the case are circulating on social media but no one will comment officially on the case.
[00:26:10.231 --> 00:26:12.432]  While it is still under investigation.
[00:26:12.632 --> 00:26:14.874]  Where is the national media on this story?
[00:26:15.034 --> 00:26:19.756]  The only outrage is actually from the politically correct downplaying the crime.
[00:26:20.156 --> 00:26:25.739]  As Snopes.com has labeled the information circulating on the web as mostly false.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.461]  And it appears Loeb actually was right, technically.
[00:26:29.742 --> 00:26:32.383]  The minors accused of the assault weren't Syrians.
[00:26:32.583 --> 00:26:39.764]  They were from Sudan and Iraq and the rest of the details are hidden from public view because minors committed the heinous act.
[00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:42.125]  Loeb's BS is correct.
[00:26:42.465 --> 00:26:56.948]  But rather than protect America's children by getting to the bottom of it and calming any fears brewing within the local community, the Twin Falls City Council would have anyone concerned branded a bigot and a white supremacist.
[00:26:57.188 --> 00:27:07.638]  The council was also grilled as to how a mosque was approved after just 24 hours, whereas a new home application would take at least two weeks just to process.
[00:27:08.018 --> 00:27:15.705]  Just another blatant example of what may be coming to, or without you even knowing, is currently happening in your community.
[00:27:15.725 --> 00:27:18.929]  You might look at us and think that we're some kind of a coalition of weirdos.
[00:27:19.369 --> 00:27:23.754]  And actually, there's professionals, there's business owners, there's college graduates.
[00:27:23.774 --> 00:27:25.616]  We're not just a bunch of weird people.
[00:27:25.696 --> 00:27:28.559]  We're people that are living here in this community, paying our taxes.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.464]  We're nationals of somewhere in the United States or Idaho.
[00:27:33.104 --> 00:27:36.989]  And we have what we feel, anyway, are legitimate concerns.
[00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:45.207]  Due to mounting pressure from the Twin Falls community, the families of the boys accused of the assault have since been evicted.
[00:27:45.508 --> 00:27:47.492]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.803]  As a way of introduction, of course, if you're a listener to InfoWars.com, you've heard him on many times.
[00:28:03.843 --> 00:28:05.784]  We have Lord Monckton on to talk.
[00:28:05.824 --> 00:28:07.645]  He is an expert on global warming.
[00:28:08.105 --> 00:28:19.252]  He's been very effective at fighting the lies of Al Gore and others, the censorship that we see surrounding man-made global warming narratives.
[00:28:19.852 --> 00:28:20.913]  He's done that in the UK.
[00:28:20.993 --> 00:28:22.294]  Of course, he's also a businessman.
[00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:23.294]  He's a newspaper editor.
[00:28:23.315 --> 00:28:25.276]  He's an inventor, a classical architect.
[00:28:26.036 --> 00:28:28.638]  And, of course, the high priest of climate skepticism.
[00:28:28.678 --> 00:28:32.321]  But today we're going to talk to him about what's going on with globalism.
[00:28:32.881 --> 00:28:48.052]  Also, if you want to find Lord Monckton, you can find him at scienceandpublicpolicy.org, where you'll find many of his papers published, and whatsupwiththat.com, where you'll find information where he exposes the lies of climate alarmism.
[00:28:49.025 --> 00:28:51.126]  But today we're going to talk about Brexit.
[00:28:51.166 --> 00:28:53.267]  We're going to talk about the economic issues.
[00:28:53.307 --> 00:28:55.228]  We're going to talk about the sovereignty issues.
[00:28:55.248 --> 00:29:03.972]  We're going to talk about the political consequences, both in Britain and in the United States, because this is a worldwide issue that is happening right now.
[00:29:04.032 --> 00:29:06.573]  Joining us now is Lord Christopher Mocton.
[00:29:06.593 --> 00:29:07.854]  Thank you for joining us, Lord Mocton.
[00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:17.436]  Well, David, it's a pleasure to be with you, and my goodness, it's exciting here, because I can't tell you who is going to win this vote tomorrow.
[00:29:17.456 --> 00:29:20.598]  I hope it's going to be the Brexiteers.
[00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:24.141]  I've already cast my vote by post, but...
[00:29:24.961 --> 00:29:26.483]  It's too close to call.
[00:29:26.523 --> 00:29:27.724]  It could go either way.
[00:29:28.065 --> 00:29:29.166]  But you're quite right.
[00:29:29.206 --> 00:29:39.237]  In your introduction and in that wonderful film, and all of the people who you showed clips of are friends of mine, this is an enormous blow.
[00:29:39.577 --> 00:29:42.861]  The fact that we've even got this referendum is an enormous blow against
[00:29:44.082 --> 00:29:46.584]  Global government power.
[00:29:47.245 --> 00:29:49.807]  They didn't ever want us to have this vote.
[00:29:50.187 --> 00:29:53.871]  And at least we've got the chance to have our say.
[00:29:54.531 --> 00:30:10.124]  And it's very evenly divided between, roughly speaking, the left and the centre-right, between the establishment and the ordinary folk, between the givers and the gobblers, to use the 8 rounds metric, and
[00:30:11.005 --> 00:30:40.265]  What is fascinating is that practically the entire global establishment, so terrified are they at the idea of Britain leaving the EU, that we've had Mr Obama speaking out, we've had Angela Merkel, the President of Germany, speaking out, we've had the Chancellor, as she's called, we've had Francois Hollande speaking out, we've had the head of the World Bank speaking out, we've had all manner with the head of the Bank of England, who is not allowed to speak out of
[00:30:42.739 --> 00:30:51.707]  All of these are, of course, wanting us to stay in because they want to tie us in to this increasingly globalised government system.
[00:30:52.546 --> 00:30:56.908]  Yes, and further away we have no control over what's going on in your lives.
[00:30:56.948 --> 00:31:04.912]  And I think that's the key phrase there, that rousing speech that was given by Boris Johnson, where he says, tomorrow can be our Independence Day.
[00:31:05.132 --> 00:31:08.534]  I mean, do Britons really want to govern themselves?
[00:31:08.854 --> 00:31:14.017]  Or do they want to be governed by some European super state that is dominated by the Germans?
[00:31:14.337 --> 00:31:15.518]  I really don't understand that.
[00:31:15.538 --> 00:31:19.760]  I mean, there was a back and forth talking about Neville Chamberlain, and they made a good
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.481]  You made a point on that the other day when they questioned Cameron on that.
[00:31:23.521 --> 00:31:25.242]  I want to play that clip and get your reactions to it.
[00:31:25.262 --> 00:31:29.683]  But I see that as another issue of appeasement and surrender.
[00:31:31.083 --> 00:31:33.284]  That is a very fair comparison.
[00:31:33.564 --> 00:31:42.307]  And of course the entire establishment throughout Europe was for appeasement in the era immediately before the Second World War.
[00:31:42.787 --> 00:31:48.329]  And I'll bet you'll never guess which the first state to speak out against Hitler openly and publicly was.
[00:31:49.229 --> 00:31:51.011]  It was actually the Holy See.
[00:31:51.251 --> 00:31:54.934]  It was the Pope Pius XII, as he was to become.
[00:31:54.954 --> 00:32:04.081]  He was then secretary to Pope Pius XI, who issued in German an encyclical letter, the first time it hadn't been in Latin since the early Middle Ages.
[00:32:04.582 --> 00:32:08.265]  And it was called Mit Brennen der Sorge, with profound concern.
[00:32:08.825 --> 00:32:10.947]  The Holy See spoke out against
[00:32:11.127 --> 00:32:15.648]  The Hitler regime, while everybody else, the Times of London, was for appeasement.
[00:32:15.668 --> 00:32:32.431]  I mean, indeed, the Daily Express in 1933 had disgraced itself by running a front-page story shortly after Hitler came to power, saying Germany is Britain's friend, and the author of its lead story was not one of its journalists, it was Joseph Goebbels.
[00:32:32.791 --> 00:32:35.432]  That was how much the establishment wanted
[00:32:36.072 --> 00:32:38.574]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:04.232 --> 00:37:09.776]  Kid Daniels here with InfoWars.com in Houston, Texas outside the Shiloh Gun Archery Range.
[00:37:10.616 --> 00:37:16.820]  Now this gun store recently made headlines for offering free CHL classes for the gay community after the Orlando shooting.
[00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:21.624]  And what was unexpected was the sheer volume of people who were interested in the classes.
[00:37:21.844 --> 00:37:24.305]  They've had hundreds of hundred people that signed up for the classes.
[00:37:24.706 --> 00:37:27.648]  Their phone lines have completely jammed, their voicemails got full.
[00:37:27.948 --> 00:37:29.769]  So let's talk to the owner and find out more.
[00:37:29.929 --> 00:37:30.930]  My name is Jeff Sanford.
[00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:35.154]  I'm the General Manager here at Shiloh Indoor Shooting Range in Northwest Houston.
[00:37:35.615 --> 00:37:37.536]  We're a family owned and operated shooting range.
[00:37:38.197 --> 00:37:40.599]  What kind of classes are you offering for the gay community right now?
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:45.564]  Well, we're doing a free license to carry class for the LGBT community.
[00:37:47.066 --> 00:37:52.731]  One of our customers and good friends of ours, his name is Ryan Thomas, and we were speaking to him after Orlando happened.
[00:37:54.913 --> 00:37:59.795]  Wanted to know, you know, I said, Hey man, I know you carry, but we'd like to do something for, for your friends.
[00:38:00.156 --> 00:38:01.816]  And he was really distraught about it.
[00:38:01.996 --> 00:38:08.940]  And seeing as it was in Orlando and so far away, I personally didn't understand why he was so distraught.
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:14.022]  And then he explained to me that, you know, Hey, these places are places that they feel like they can go anytime.
[00:38:14.062 --> 00:38:16.643]  And that's the one place that they can feel totally safe.
[00:38:16.684 --> 00:38:21.546]  So even though it happens States away from us, it's affecting the community here tremendously as well.
[00:38:22.246 --> 00:38:25.388]  And so I said, well, man, let's do something for your friends.
[00:38:25.448 --> 00:38:27.289]  So tell some of your friends.
[00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.311]  We'll give them a free license to carry class.
[00:38:29.911 --> 00:38:34.594]  And we thought that would be maybe one or two classes with 30 or 40 people total.
[00:38:35.235 --> 00:38:43.300]  And so far today, about two days after we announced it, we're at either approaching or just past 300 students signed up.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.683]  What was supposed to be one or two classes is now 10 classes and about to open in 11th.
[00:38:48.578 --> 00:38:51.900]  So what kind of public response did you get from this when you announced the class?
[00:38:52.741 --> 00:38:55.903]  Most of the response has been really, really overwhelmingly positive.
[00:38:56.143 --> 00:39:00.346]  You know, there's a few detractors, but you can't do anything without having at least a few detractors.
[00:39:01.007 --> 00:39:03.929]  And, you know, it's been outstanding.
[00:39:03.969 --> 00:39:08.552]  We've had veterans that have called and said, hey, we want to come up and provide security for your classes.
[00:39:08.973 --> 00:39:16.418]  We have police officers that are off-duty, spending their off-duty time up here volunteering their time to come up and provide security for the classes.
[00:39:17.278 --> 00:39:22.142]  I've had license to carry instructors from all over the state giving me a call saying, hey man, I'll be more than happy to come up.
[00:39:22.402 --> 00:39:27.785]  I'll do anything from teaching the entire class to just pushing brass around the range when they're done shooting.
[00:39:28.226 --> 00:39:33.629]  We've had a tremendous amount of goodwill from the shooting community as a whole.
[00:39:34.029 --> 00:39:41.995]  I think everybody realizes that this is a golden opportunity for us to take what has been a small percentage of our population
[00:39:42.595 --> 00:39:47.758]  At you know, maybe 3.8% and really bring them into into our world.
[00:39:48.018 --> 00:39:51.901]  You know, they have not felt safe to be able to come to a place like a shooting range.
[00:39:51.981 --> 00:39:55.723]  And while we may think, why wouldn't you feel safe to go to a shooting range?
[00:39:55.763 --> 00:39:57.264]  You know, we're great people here.
[00:39:57.324 --> 00:39:59.125]  You know, we like to be friends with everybody.
[00:39:59.566 --> 00:40:04.709]  The fact is, is that I've talked to 300 people, and none of them they've all told me the same thing.
[00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:10.994]  We've never felt like that's the kind of place that we would belong, and so we've put this off and put it off, but now we can actually do it.
[00:40:11.355 --> 00:40:25.868]  So this is a golden opportunity for us as gun owners, as Second Amendment advocates, to say, hey, come join us, be part of what we do, and have an entire new range of Second Amendment advocates out there for us.
[00:40:25.888 --> 00:40:26.709]  3.8% of the population
[00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:39.960]  Takes legislation from a minor loss to a tremendous overwhelming victory if we can get that 3.8% and bring them into our world of self-defense and self-preservation.
[00:40:40.641 --> 00:40:44.765]  Have you had some people that showed up for the classes that never shot a gun before?
[00:40:45.723 --> 00:40:46.423]  Almost all of them.
[00:40:47.144 --> 00:40:47.864]  That's been the thing.
[00:40:48.464 --> 00:40:57.949]  Out of the nearly 300 people that have signed up, out of all the ones that I've talked to, I think I've got maybe 10 that have their own firearm and have experience with a firearm.
[00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:02.452]  So we're trying to do our part to make sure that when they get their license to carry,
[00:41:03.032 --> 00:41:17.656]  You know, part of the license to carry is doing a shooting qualification, so we've got everybody coming in an hour and a half before the license to carry starts so that we can do a training class, a basic pistol one with them, so that they can go in there and competently and confidently shoot their shooting test.
[00:41:18.176 --> 00:41:22.757]  So you think their perception of firearms in general has changed positively since they took the class?
[00:41:23.863 --> 00:41:36.507]  You know, we're doing our first class right now, and the group has been a lot of fun, and I definitely think that if we continue to do our part, then we're going to have a new wave of Second Amendment advocates out there.
[00:41:37.087 --> 00:41:38.888]  More advocacy for the Second Amendment!
[00:41:38.908 --> 00:41:46.330]  I hate to sound like a broken record, but that's what this is all about, you know, and there have been people that, you know, I've read the stupidest comments online from
[00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.652]  Oh, this is just a money grab, too.
[00:41:49.112 --> 00:41:52.095]  Oh, I guarantee they've raised the prices of their guns.
[00:41:52.515 --> 00:41:55.417]  Well, it's kind of hard to make money when you do something for free, you know.
[00:41:55.658 --> 00:42:02.503]  We did charge a nominal $25 fee for the training class and a free rental gun, you know.
[00:42:02.763 --> 00:42:03.244]  Low cost.
[00:42:03.744 --> 00:42:04.285]  Very much.
[00:42:04.765 --> 00:42:06.648]  Very much so.
[00:42:07.148 --> 00:42:09.371]  And we haven't raised the price of anything else.
[00:42:09.431 --> 00:42:11.413]  The guns, the ammo, everything is the same price.
[00:42:11.794 --> 00:42:22.566]  This is about welcoming a new group and having a very loud and passionate group of people join us and trying to retain our rights when we have so many politicians right now.
[00:42:22.926 --> 00:42:23.227]  Namely.
[00:42:23.866 --> 00:42:27.791]  Yeah, I would like to say only the Democrats, but Mitch McConnell is now in the fold.
[00:42:28.232 --> 00:42:30.675]  Well, he has been with them, but now we're hearing him with gun control.
[00:42:31.296 --> 00:42:35.461]  So, we've got another group that we can bring in.
[00:42:35.681 --> 00:42:36.302]  3.8% of the population.
[00:42:36.422 --> 00:42:40.648]  Doesn't sound like a large number, but it's a large number when you think about it legislatively.
[00:42:40.908 --> 00:42:43.349]  How's gun sales been since the Orlando shooting?
[00:42:44.229 --> 00:42:47.750]  They were getting, they were, everything was ramping up before that anyway.
[00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:54.571]  You know, every time Hillary opens her mouth, she becomes the greatest gun salesman that we could ever imagine.
[00:42:55.251 --> 00:43:03.993]  So I'm going to speak out, I'm going to do everything I can to rally people against this pernicious, corrupting influence of the NRA.
[00:43:04.134 --> 00:43:05.794]  We've got to go after this.
[00:43:06.505 --> 00:43:11.009]  She's sold more guns than the NRA could have ever tried to do.
[00:43:11.609 --> 00:43:15.472]  There's a gun store owner in Austin, Michael Cargill, he said the same thing about Obama.
[00:43:15.732 --> 00:43:25.480]  Yeah, well we've been saying about him for eight years and now that Hillary's doing the same thing, she's ready to take her Salesman of the Year mantle from him and put her...
[00:43:26.921 --> 00:43:27.521]  Face on it.
[00:43:29.022 --> 00:43:31.644]  But yeah man, it is ramped up.
[00:43:31.724 --> 00:43:33.545]  Bulk ammunition sales have ramped up.
[00:43:34.045 --> 00:43:41.889]  Academy pulled their AR-15s from the shelves and now they're reporting anybody that buys 10 or more boxes of ammunition what they consider high power when a .223 is done.
[00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:44.111]  Anything but a high-power gun.
[00:43:45.772 --> 00:43:56.698]  And so that, I've noticed a ton of my customers are coming in and they're coming to me and saying, okay, yeah, I'll pay two dollars more a box now because that's bullcrap what they're doing over there and I would rather support you than support them.
[00:43:56.938 --> 00:43:58.859]  Well, thank you and we appreciate that.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:04.523]  Is this the kind of largest popularity you've seen with classes so far?
[00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:10.311]  Every election season that comes in, the classes go through the roof.
[00:44:11.051 --> 00:44:16.153]  And this past, I think the most that I've seen was after the San Bernardino shooting.
[00:44:16.593 --> 00:44:24.535]  Because we had a combination of people being off for the holidays, we had the San Bernardino shooting, and then we had politicians talking about gun control.
[00:44:25.235 --> 00:44:32.581]  And our average license-to-carry class went from about 20, 22 people per class to 55 people per class.
[00:44:32.701 --> 00:44:34.843]  And we were running several classes a week.
[00:44:34.923 --> 00:44:38.706]  That went from two classes a week to three or four classes a week.
[00:44:38.827 --> 00:44:40.488]  Every one of them with 55 people in it.
[00:44:40.868 --> 00:44:50.576]  Not to mention the 10 or 12 instructors that are outside instructors with their own license-to-carry businesses that were bringing their 35 to 60 students to qualify here.
[00:44:51.117 --> 00:44:52.778]  And so we were opening our doors at 6 a.m.
[00:44:54.059 --> 00:44:58.301]  For instructors to come qualify people and by the time we'd open for business by 10 a.m.
[00:44:58.901 --> 00:45:00.602]  several hundred people had already qualified.
[00:45:00.622 --> 00:45:03.163]  So how many people are you expect now to show up for the classes?
[00:45:04.484 --> 00:45:11.167]  Gosh, I'm thinking right now our class that for the previous few weeks has been sitting right around 18 students.
[00:45:11.627 --> 00:45:12.167]  I believe we're at 33.
[00:45:13.468 --> 00:45:15.549]  So it's only going to continue to grow.
[00:45:15.989 --> 00:45:19.771]  It's not going to get any lower and so if you're waiting, if you're on the fence to get it,
[00:45:20.171 --> 00:45:21.292]  Get your damn license.
[00:45:21.712 --> 00:45:30.215]  If you've already taken it and you haven't sent your paperwork in yet, the longer you wait, the longer it's going to take to get it back from the state, because everybody is doing it.
[00:45:31.836 --> 00:45:39.679]  I would like to say to all my other gun shop owners, to the gun range owners, to license to carry instructors out there,
[00:45:40.379 --> 00:45:42.541]  This is our golden opportunity.
[00:45:43.162 --> 00:45:44.503]  I want to challenge everybody else.
[00:45:44.603 --> 00:45:45.344]  Do the same thing.
[00:45:45.424 --> 00:45:46.565]  Put together a program.
[00:45:46.945 --> 00:45:56.514]  Bring more people into what we do because we are hanging on by a small thread right now and we need more people on our side.
[00:46:02.938 --> 00:46:18.325]  You know, with all this talk lately about gun control, it occurred to me that I've yet to see a single politician who can explain to me how they plan to take guns away from the criminal thugs who are out there on the streets right now.
[00:46:18.986 --> 00:46:25.429]  Oh sure, you'll hear plenty of talk about how they plan to take guns away from us, us law-abiding citizens.
[00:46:26.109 --> 00:46:34.572]  But if you take guns away from all of us legal gun owners, then the only people that will have guns will be the bad guys.
[00:46:35.233 --> 00:46:36.453]  In fact, I'm curious.
[00:46:36.853 --> 00:46:38.614]  I want to see a show of hands right now.
[00:46:38.994 --> 00:46:41.055]  All those for gun control, raise your hands.
[00:46:41.615 --> 00:46:44.436]  Alright, there's one, two, three, four.
[00:46:45.377 --> 00:46:45.857]  Anyone else?
[00:46:47.898 --> 00:46:49.238]  Ah, see there, that figures.
[00:46:49.779 --> 00:46:51.119]  All the usual suspects.
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:52.860]  Any questions?
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:07.462]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:07.602 --> 00:47:09.783]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.903 --> 00:47:16.706]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:16.946 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.408]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:52.195]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:37.600]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:48:59.755 --> 00:49:08.663]  Donald Trump seems to have no shortage of supporters, and this one's coming all the way from the UK.
[00:49:09.083 --> 00:49:11.005]  John Acquaviva joins us via Skype.
[00:49:11.725 --> 00:49:13.107]  Thank you for joining us today, John.
[00:49:14.738 --> 00:49:15.518]  Thank you for having me.
[00:49:15.538 --> 00:49:16.239]  All right.
[00:49:16.279 --> 00:49:20.021]  Now, before we get into some other topics, let's start off with this Trump video that you made.
[00:49:20.381 --> 00:49:22.383]  Of course, Trump is the hot topic here in the U.S.
[00:49:22.443 --> 00:49:22.843]  right now.
[00:49:23.283 --> 00:49:26.825]  So can you tell us about the video and what prompted you to make it in the first place?
[00:49:28.566 --> 00:49:42.775]  And pretty much the reason I made it was because I saw that one of the main things that was being used to kind of attack Trump and still is, is the fact that supposedly he's been changing his opinions for the past year and a half.
[00:49:43.596 --> 00:49:53.640]  And I just wanted to show, in reality, how consistent he's been with the actual core principles and ideas, which is what the American people care about.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:50:07.544]  And I just thought, what better way to do it than taking advantage of the fact that he, obviously being a public figure for pretty much all of his life, he's done countless interviews and he's shared these opinions live TV before.
[00:50:07.644 --> 00:50:08.985]  So why not make a compilation?
[00:50:09.525 --> 00:50:12.366]  So I made the compilation with a guy called Chris Hermsey.
[00:50:13.332 --> 00:50:18.854]  We both managed to find these different clips, put them together, and yeah, it's been really well received.
[00:50:18.954 --> 00:50:24.576]  And obviously with the push that you guys gave when you uploaded it to your website, it's gone pretty much viral now.
[00:50:25.397 --> 00:50:27.017]  And how long did it take you to compile?
[00:50:27.418 --> 00:50:30.819]  There's a lot of clips in there, so how long did it take you to get all those and put them in a clip?
[00:50:32.379 --> 00:50:36.101]  It took about, I'd say, a week and a half.
[00:50:37.213 --> 00:50:40.336]  Yeah, it wasn't that long, but I think it was worth it then.
[00:50:40.356 --> 00:50:43.659]  I mean, people seemed to love it, and it was something that needed to be done.
[00:50:43.799 --> 00:50:45.840]  So no complaints on my part.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:46.901]  It was a time well invested.
[00:50:47.502 --> 00:50:47.882]  All right.
[00:50:48.282 --> 00:50:50.084]  Now, you're living over there in the UK now.
[00:50:50.845 --> 00:50:54.748]  Is there a general consensus that you can see regarding Donald Trump?
[00:50:54.788 --> 00:50:56.870]  Are people for him, against him, indifferent?
[00:50:58.446 --> 00:51:07.090]  The thing with what's going on in the UK is that people aren't really interested in their own politics, let alone what's going on in America.
[00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:08.711]  That's what I see, at least.
[00:51:09.211 --> 00:51:15.534]  I mean, when you get the population as a whole, especially millennials in England, they're not really interested in politics at all.
[00:51:16.214 --> 00:51:24.958]  So what they will do is they'll just take whatever headline their favourite newspaper magazine puts out and they'll just roll with whatever it says, whether it's in favour or against.
[00:51:25.762 --> 00:51:33.305]  But if you speak to them about his policies and his ideas, they won't have a clue about it, so it's pretty much just whatever they want to follow.
[00:51:33.905 --> 00:51:36.626]  That's pretty much the way it is here, so you're in good company.
[00:51:37.106 --> 00:51:41.548]  But also, just quickly, you touched on it there, but any thoughts on Brexit?
[00:51:41.588 --> 00:51:44.029]  Do you guys, or you personally, do you feel one way or the other?
[00:51:46.116 --> 00:51:48.898]  Well, obviously I want to leave.
[00:51:49.458 --> 00:51:57.522]  I think that's the only way that we can take back control of the country and stop it from turning into something like Sweden, for example.
[00:51:57.542 --> 00:51:59.682]  Something that has to happen.
[00:51:59.963 --> 00:52:07.386]  And if it doesn't happen, which I'm pretty confident it will, if it doesn't happen, it will be probably the biggest mistake
[00:52:08.087 --> 00:52:10.328]  The British people have ever done in this generation.
[00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:23.757]  And yeah, I mean, in terms of what I feel is going on, obviously with what happened with the murder of Joe Cox, they just completely used that, the Remain side used it for their own political gain.
[00:52:24.217 --> 00:52:29.200]  They've been shamelessly plastering it all over the media, trying to win sympathy points.
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:31.281]  And I don't think it's worked.
[00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:36.925]  I think British people are more intelligent than that, and they're able to see past that shamefulness and just
[00:52:37.728 --> 00:52:41.290]  Be able to understand that voting to leave is the best thing that we can do.
[00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:42.951]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:52:43.291 --> 00:52:46.432]  Now you live in the UK now, but you're originally from Venezuela, correct?
[00:52:47.513 --> 00:52:48.613]  Yep, born and raised.
[00:52:49.053 --> 00:52:58.918]  Alright, so let's talk a little bit about that, because I run into a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters here, I'm not sure how familiar you are with him, but people basically pushing for a strong sense of socialism.
[00:52:59.999 --> 00:53:01.680]  With Venezuela and what you came from,
[00:53:02.998 --> 00:53:04.119]  Well, let's backtrack a little bit.
[00:53:04.139 --> 00:53:07.501]  Would Venezuela, do you like the way Venezuela is right now?
[00:53:09.883 --> 00:53:14.587]  To put it mildly, Venezuela is currently hell on earth.
[00:53:15.748 --> 00:53:20.911]  Venezuela is the country that has everything in terms of potential.
[00:53:21.272 --> 00:53:21.692]  Everything.
[00:53:22.062 --> 00:53:26.246]  It has some of the most amazing landscapes and sceneries that you could ever imagine.
[00:53:26.846 --> 00:53:35.694]  It has endless natural resources and it has completely been destroyed due to socialist policies.
[00:53:36.055 --> 00:53:38.657]  It has been taken into being currently
[00:53:39.233 --> 00:53:42.474]  The country with the lowest standard of life in the world.
[00:53:42.974 --> 00:53:46.935]  You have people hunting down pigeons and dogs on the street to feed their family.
[00:53:47.256 --> 00:53:57.599]  You have people desecrating the tombs of people who've been dead for a hundred years just to be able to see if they can find some jewellery to steal to then sell and be able to afford some food.
[00:53:57.979 --> 00:54:04.421]  You have people killing each other in food lines just to be able to fight over the last bag of flour or the last pot of milk.
[00:54:04.981 --> 00:54:10.024]  It is a complete catastrophe, and it goes to show what socialism ends up being.
[00:54:10.724 --> 00:54:15.847]  When you leave socialism long enough in a country, it will always end up like Venezuela.
[00:54:16.988 --> 00:54:17.588]  That's very good.
[00:54:17.628 --> 00:54:22.471]  I'm glad you said that, because there are a lot of people here who use Venezuela as somewhat of an example.
[00:54:22.491 --> 00:54:24.452]  They say we should have socialism like Venezuela.
[00:54:24.472 --> 00:54:25.273]  I'm like, well, it's not.
[00:54:25.933 --> 00:54:29.155]  People are killing dogs in the street, as you say, just to feed their families.
[00:54:29.215 --> 00:54:32.217]  It's not exactly an ideal situation as you describe it there.
[00:54:33.473 --> 00:54:33.853]  Exactly.
[00:54:33.953 --> 00:54:50.446]  And here, for example, something that really bothers me, which is one of the reasons I like InfoWars, I like what you guys do so much, is because you constantly make content and videos and articles about what's going on in Venezuela, something that hardly none of the mainstream media, especially here in England, do.
[00:54:50.907 --> 00:54:59.033]  I have seen a handful of articles and news bits related to Venezuela in the four years that I've been living in England.
[00:54:59.525 --> 00:55:10.011]  It is a disgrace and the reason is because in England they're trying to push the same kind of socialist agenda that took Venezuela from being a paradise on earth to being hell on earth.
[00:55:10.311 --> 00:55:15.534]  You got Jeremy Corbyn saying a couple of years ago that Venezuela is what England should aspire to be.
[00:55:15.995 --> 00:55:17.796]  So obviously they're not going to show how it really is.
[00:55:19.677 --> 00:55:24.840]  Yes, now here in my bio it says that you were put on a cyber terrorism watch list, is that correct?
[00:55:25.976 --> 00:55:27.638]  Yeah, that was in 2014.
[00:55:27.679 --> 00:55:29.301]  We had the longest going riot.
[00:55:29.521 --> 00:55:31.664]  It lasted almost three months every day.
[00:55:31.744 --> 00:55:38.674]  Thousands and thousands of people all over the streets and all over the country in Venezuela just protesting, trying to get rid of the government.
[00:55:39.694 --> 00:55:39.994]  I don't know.
[00:55:59.131 --> 00:56:01.192]  There was hardly no information, no news.
[00:56:01.572 --> 00:56:03.853]  I had my mum and my dad living in Venezuela at that time.
[00:56:04.253 --> 00:56:07.574]  They were calling me, being in England, to ask me what was going on.
[00:56:08.094 --> 00:56:09.855]  There was no way that they could find out.
[00:56:10.295 --> 00:56:13.676]  I knew because I had all my contacts on social media that let me know what was going on.
[00:56:13.716 --> 00:56:20.679]  But besides that, the media was completely turning a blind eye to the fact that Venezuela was going through the biggest protest in its history.
[00:56:21.279 --> 00:56:27.281]  So what happened was, because of me spreading this information, I got put on this cyber-terrorism list.
[00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:32.293]  Out of which, I think it was eight or nine people ended up getting put in jail.
[00:56:32.473 --> 00:56:36.236]  These are all people who got put in jail just for sending out tweets against the government.
[00:56:37.257 --> 00:56:39.458]  And most of them are still in jail to this day.
[00:56:39.558 --> 00:56:41.560]  So just goes to show the state of the country.
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:42.600]  How long have they been in jail?
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:43.901]  You said that was a while ago, right?
[00:56:44.802 --> 00:56:46.403]  Yeah, it's been over two years now.
[00:56:46.503 --> 00:56:47.023]  Oh, two years.
[00:56:47.103 --> 00:56:47.384]  Wow.
[00:56:47.444 --> 00:56:48.404]  Just for sending out tweets.
[00:56:49.225 --> 00:56:49.345]  Yep.
[00:56:50.359 --> 00:56:51.981]  Geez, that is absolutely ridiculous.
[00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:53.923]  And we got about two minutes left here.
[00:56:53.943 --> 00:56:56.726]  I also want to talk to you about the mass immigration.
[00:56:56.746 --> 00:57:00.510]  A lot of people going into Europe, the European area over there.
[00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:04.194]  And just your personal opinion, we see things on the news, good, bad and different.
[00:57:04.675 --> 00:57:09.380]  Just your personal opinion, do you think that the mass migrant immigration is something good for Europe?
[00:57:11.383 --> 00:57:30.648]  I mean, people who try to make the point that mass, uncontrolled immigration, especially from countries that have cultures that are completely against our values and our freedoms that we have in the West, isn't somehow good, or is to be invited, or is to be promoted, is an absolute disgrace.
[00:57:31.128 --> 00:57:40.452]  The fact that people can't understand that when we have so many issues in England that we can't even take care of for our own people in England, such as the housing issues, such as the NHS crisis.
[00:57:40.912 --> 00:57:55.818]  When you have all of those issues that are affecting British-born people paying taxes in England, and then you just want to add more to that equation by bringing in more people with no kind of control, with no kind of skills to be able to obtain jobs, to be able to provide some value back into the country.
[00:57:56.158 --> 00:57:56.938]  Just let them all in.
[00:57:56.958 --> 00:57:58.699]  It is a complete disgrace.
[00:58:00.334 --> 00:58:08.600]  I hear that because nobody wants to be seen as discriminating, but here in the United States of America we have an epidemic of homelessness.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:11.382]  Veterans not getting treatment and on and on and on.
[00:58:11.922 --> 00:58:13.583]  Like you said, job situations as well.
[00:58:14.043 --> 00:58:15.804]  Can we help the people here first?
[00:58:16.185 --> 00:58:17.926]  It's nothing against the people in other countries.
[00:58:18.306 --> 00:58:20.947]  Yes, we understand that in various countries around the world, the U.S.
[00:58:20.967 --> 00:58:26.649]  has had a hand in making those situations worse, whether it's, you know, Pakistan or some of those Middle Eastern countries.
[00:58:26.689 --> 00:58:28.490]  But you have to take care of your own people first.
[00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:33.512]  John Acquavivo, very quick, do you have a website or something people can use to contact you?
[00:58:33.532 --> 00:58:36.813]  The easiest way is just on my social media.
[00:58:37.573 --> 00:58:41.635]  On Twitter, you can find me at Iam2Numerical2Skilled.
[00:58:42.075 --> 00:58:43.775]  Don't judge me on that username.
[00:58:43.835 --> 00:58:45.216]  I created it about five years ago.
[00:58:45.993 --> 00:58:49.599]  And on Facebook, just put in John Patrick Equiviva and you'll find it there.
[00:58:50.621 --> 00:58:52.584]  Alright, well thank you so much for joining us today, John.
[00:58:53.286 --> 00:58:54.067]  Thank you for having me.

[00:58:55.529 --> 00:58:58.034]  Thank you for joining us and we'll see you again tomorrow night.
