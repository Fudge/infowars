[00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:12.075]  Well, when it comes to telephone calls, every member of Congress has been briefed on this program.
[00:00:13.736 --> 00:00:21.381]  With respect to all these programs, the relevant intelligence committees are fully briefed on these programs.
[00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:28.545]  These are programs that have been authorized by broad bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006.
[00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:42.804]  And at the outset it's important to understand that your duly elected representatives have been consistently informed on exactly what we're doing.
[00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:49.230]  The apparatus of the Obama administration's NSA tentacles apparently have zero boundaries.
[00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:59.618]  After spying on journalists, foreign dignitaries, and the average Joe, it has finally now come to light that Obama and company have been spying on Congress itself.
[00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:04.601]  I'm appalled by when we listen in on foreigners' conversation when they're talking to Americans.
[00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:08.484]  We're scooping up tens of thousands of conversations of Americans.
[00:01:08.564 --> 00:01:11.606]  This is a real problem because it's a real invasion of our privacy.
[00:01:11.986 --> 00:01:19.431]  At this point, it wouldn't surprise anyone if funeral arrangements for the Fourth Amendment were announced within the next few days.
[00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:27.376]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:01:28.757 --> 00:01:29.097]  No, sir.
[00:01:30.652 --> 00:01:31.153]  It does not.
[00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:33.935]  Not wittingly.
[00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:42.283]  As the communications of allies such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were monitored, so were their interactions with U.S.
[00:01:42.343 --> 00:01:48.028]  members of Congress, as well as American private interest groups, with links to the foreign leaders.
[00:01:48.568 --> 00:01:49.529]  One unnamed U.S.
[00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.252]  official revealed to the Wall Street Journal that the practice raised fears.
[00:01:53.673 --> 00:01:54.514]  Oh, sh**!
[00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:59.756]  The executive branch would be accused of spying on Congress.
[00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:08.760]  The Obama administration were wary of this and so simply allowed the NSA to decide what to share without making any specific requests.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.282]  We didn't say do it, a senior US official said.
[00:02:12.562 --> 00:02:14.342]  We didn't say don't do it.
[00:02:14.663 --> 00:02:22.246]  You can see how it would stifle speech if you're going to eavesdrop on congressmen and that it might stifle what they say or who they communicate with.
[00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:27.368]  We absolutely need more controls on the NSA and more controls on our intelligence agencies.
[00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:29.409]  Forget controls, Senator Paul.
[00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:30.869]  We need heads to roll.
[00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.011]  And where is the President during this unprecedented breach of the Constitution?
[00:02:35.211 --> 00:02:42.894]  If you hadn't noticed, President Obama is down in Hawaii on an extended two-plus-week vacation that is costing taxpayers no less than
[00:02:45.535 --> 00:02:46.236]  $470,000 per day.
[00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:57.801]  Once Obama finally leaves office, if he does, he will have spent nearly $70 million of taxpayer money on just 7 Hawaiian vacations alone.
[00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:01.663]  The last time I checked, the President's annual salary was $400,000 per year.
[00:03:03.464 --> 00:03:08.527]  With a $50,000 annual expense account and $19,000 for entertainment.
[00:03:08.747 --> 00:03:24.456]  When did anybody agree to fund $70 million of taxpayer money so that our thief and chief could live like a billionaire and focus on the new Star Wars film while putting his toes in the sand and simultaneously destroying our founding principles?
[00:03:24.776 --> 00:03:31.842]  Early this morning a House panel hastily announced it had opened an investigation into the overreaching intelligence collection of Congress.
[00:03:32.102 --> 00:03:33.143]  Can you hear that sound?
[00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:36.485]  That's the sound of Tricky Dick rolling in his grave.
[00:03:37.106 --> 00:03:41.249]  I have never profited, never profited from public service.
[00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:42.550]  I've earned every cent.
[00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.134]  I welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their president's a crook.
[00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:49.635]  Well I'm not a crook.
[00:03:50.356 --> 00:03:52.277]  I've earned everything I've got.
[00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:53.778]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:04:03.203 --> 00:04:09.305]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about a potential forbearance situation?
[00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:12.647]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:14.367]  Here we go, folks, I'm being a sergeant!
[00:04:14.407 --> 00:04:20.670]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:26.192]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:30.593]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:30.773 --> 00:04:33.694]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:33.854 --> 00:04:41.857]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:42.117 --> 00:04:44.178]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:44.238 --> 00:04:45.258]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:54.387]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
