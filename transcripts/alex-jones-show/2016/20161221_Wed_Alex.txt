[00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:15.277]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Wednesday the 21st day of December 2016.
[00:00:15.577 --> 00:00:17.698]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:25.503]  What type of evil heart seeks to attack something as pure and good and beautiful as Christmas?
[00:00:26.683 --> 00:00:33.868]  What type of demon sees happy families and smiling faces as a threat and decides to smash a truck into it?
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:44.204]  What type of evil is drawn out of its spider hole to attack smiling families dancing under the stars around Christmas trees?
[00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:51.967]  What type of serpent is conjured by Christmas carols and prays to Jesus Christ?
[00:00:52.548 --> 00:01:04.233]  And what type of evil knowingly brings this cancer into the midst of the people and then protects it, then lies for it, and even finances it?
[00:01:12.473 --> 00:01:27.186]  As we approach the twilight of 2016, I personally am reflecting on the historical, the magical things that have happened in the last year.
[00:01:28.303 --> 00:01:33.787]  We have seen a global awakening to the corporate planetary tyranny that was being established.
[00:01:34.288 --> 00:01:38.791]  We have seen nations across the world begin to pull out of the unelected globalist system.
[00:01:40.252 --> 00:01:47.018]  We have seen human self-determination spring back to life like the mythical phoenix.
[00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.361]  I am so honored to be able to speak to you every day.
[00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:53.703]  I am so honored to be able to talk to you and your families.
[00:01:54.323 --> 00:01:55.264]  I am humbled
[00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.252]  By the fact that Infowars is such a critical part of the fight against the globalists and the fact that we're beginning to turn the tide.
[00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:08.775]  But I always want to make the point that it's you that is the lifeblood, the core of what we're doing.
[00:02:09.727 --> 00:02:13.030]  Because you really are the key to everything.
[00:02:13.811 --> 00:02:15.753]  You have the light of God in your eyes.
[00:02:16.334 --> 00:02:17.735]  You're made the image of the Creator.
[00:02:18.316 --> 00:02:23.221]  And that's what this Christmas is all about, is remembering our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:02:24.142 --> 00:02:31.429]  That's why the jihadis, controlled by the globalists, have been turned loose and brought into Europe, to attack viciously and drive us into submission.
[00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:41.026]  The social engineers admit they're going to bring in political correctness that are already doing it to say that we have no free speech because we're the ones that are causing the Islamicists to attack us.
[00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:50.189]  Obama, when there was a stabbing attack of nine people, and he was running over people with cars in Ohio State, came out the day after and said, this is not Islam.
[00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:57.583]  So-called liberals came out and said that he shouldn't have been shot by police as he ran towards them with a knife after stabbing nine people.
[00:02:58.204 --> 00:03:06.389]  They tell us the attacks in Germany and the attacks in France with trucks running over people at Christmas parties and national anthem events isn't Islam.
[00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.751]  They talk to us like we're idiots.
[00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:14.615]  But we all know the globalists are against Christmas and against any other system of Western culture.
[00:03:15.035 --> 00:03:16.196]  That's why at colleges and
[00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:21.337]  High schools, elementary schools across the nation, Christmas has been banned.
[00:03:22.097 --> 00:03:23.518]  Now they're banning the word holiday.
[00:03:24.878 --> 00:03:28.480]  They're even telling students they can't pass out Christmas cards.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.500]  That's your free speech.
[00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:34.282]  Separation of church and state means we don't have a state-run religion.
[00:03:35.106 --> 00:03:36.386]  Doesn't mean we don't have free speech.
[00:03:37.346 --> 00:03:40.667]  But we do have a state-run religion now and it's called political correctness.
[00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:45.888]  And it's a cult that's antithetical to our Western society and culture.
[00:03:46.508 --> 00:03:58.651]  Christianity and our Judeo-Christian roots is the heart of common law and the civilization we've built, while not perfect, is heads above any other system.
[00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:03.892]  In the freedom it delivers, in the choice it delivers, in the security it delivers.
[00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:07.417]  In the love and compassion it delivers.
[00:04:08.017 --> 00:04:10.618]  It's the West in Christianity that ended slavery worldwide.
[00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.760]  It's the West in Christianity that brought forward women's suffrage.
[00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:18.923]  It's the West in Christianity that we have to thank for everything we've got good today.
[00:04:19.784 --> 00:04:26.848]  And it's important for us to get on the offensive to the globalists and the fake feminists and the other social engineers that seek to make us weak.
[00:04:27.508 --> 00:04:29.930]  It's time to embrace again what made us strong.
[00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.110]  It's time.
[00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:38.743]  To realize that we do have destiny, we do have providence, and that's why these snakes of the earth attack that.
[00:04:39.524 --> 00:04:57.475]  So, for this Christmas season, I want to salute all of you of every race, color, and creed who are of the human race, and invite you to join us in celebration of Christmas, even if you're not a Christian, in defense of free speech, and in defense of Western civilization.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:08.031]  In defense of beauty, in defense of families, in defense of free association and free will, Merry Christmas to all.
[00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:11.603]  They don't do real interviews.
[00:05:11.683 --> 00:05:16.005]  They talk to you for three hours, edit it to act like you're a journalist, and twist it.
[00:05:16.045 --> 00:05:16.645]  What's the point?
[00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:20.227]  Well, we're seeing the death of mainstream media, which is fantastic.
[00:05:20.287 --> 00:05:23.308]  That's why the so-called fake news, because there's no competition.
[00:05:23.328 --> 00:05:24.909]  There's not enough diversity in media.
[00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.591]  So you end up with five or six media outlets rushing to be the first to report on a story.
[00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:31.111]  They manufacture news.
[00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:37.794]  You know, Noam Chomsky wrote a famous book, Manufacturing Consent, how the mainstream media has co-opted for the corporate agenda.
[00:05:38.294 --> 00:05:38.874]  And that is
[00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:42.617]  A textbook on how to create fake news.
[00:05:42.977 --> 00:05:56.309]  Now, the old media space and what Infowars has done has been to introduce what I would call the acid meme to shoot down the fake news of the mainstream media.
[00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:05.997]  So when they jump on some of these stories that are, let's say Pepe the Frog, for example, which turned into a Hillary Clinton bashing, killing meme.
[00:06:06.698 --> 00:06:12.362]  That generated from 4chan, it generated from the internet, it was picked up by- It causes Streisand effect.
[00:06:12.582 --> 00:06:14.023]  Right, it causes Streisand effect.
[00:06:14.303 --> 00:06:16.745]  She buys into it and she looks stupid.
[00:06:16.785 --> 00:06:22.748]  But because she's not really in touch with how the media works in America anymore, she sets herself up to look stupid.
[00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:35.837]  People who are actually involved in media every single day, who quote multiple media sources, go to international media sources, they saw the gestation of that fake meme- Exactly, it's not that any of us are perfect.
[00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:38.960]  But we just go to the wide spectrum different views.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.943]  We're not in the regurgitation echo chamber they're in.
[00:06:42.184 --> 00:06:43.685]  They're claiming we're in an echo chamber.
[00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:45.948]  We're in a total free-for-all.
[00:06:45.968 --> 00:06:47.029]  Look, I've been on RT.
[00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:48.811]  I've done a thousand shows for RT.
[00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:51.254]  Russia Today comes out of Moscow.
[00:06:51.414 --> 00:06:54.298]  You've told me the Russians never give you any talking points.
[00:06:54.818 --> 00:06:55.298]  No, no.
[00:06:55.358 --> 00:06:56.339]  It's like unheard of.
[00:06:56.359 --> 00:07:01.703]  Everybody I know that's been on RT says, I've probably been on there 200 times, they've never told me, don't cover this or do that.
[00:07:01.783 --> 00:07:04.524]  You try to go on CNN, it's like three hour interrogations.
[00:07:04.584 --> 00:07:06.005]  Look, BBC is the worst.
[00:07:06.065 --> 00:07:15.832]  The BBC, they put you through three or four interrogations before you go on, and a lot of times they just steal your stuff and give it to some other producer and they don't even... That's what they do, they get you there.
[00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:29.697]  The BBC has been aghast at the Brexit vote, the rise of Nigel Farage, and they were- The Italians just voted to start getting out of the EU?
[00:07:29.777 --> 00:07:39.160]  Right, they're totally caught flat-footed because they're not in touch with actually what's happening in the media space, what's happening in the news, and they totally misunderstood what you're all about and what you're doing.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.828]  And so now we have the Trump effect and the Trump effect is a remarkable phenomenon in American history.
[00:07:44.868 --> 00:07:55.904]  This is basically and we're going to see now the Constitution in action because I think Trump is going to approach this presidency in a way that we haven't seen maybe ever.
[00:07:56.124 --> 00:07:58.326]  He's not beholden to anyone.
[00:07:58.767 --> 00:08:02.891]  He's going to take a look at every single deal, every single relationship, and it's up for review.
[00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:10.318]  That's like he said, everything should be a deal-by-deal basis, not some secret multinational agreement we then don't get to even look at and then we follow.
[00:08:18.314 --> 00:08:28.327]  29.
[00:08:18.334 --> 00:08:28.327]  29 days until the anti-globalist president is seated as the 45th president of the United States.
[00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:30.831]  His victory is our victory.
[00:08:31.372 --> 00:08:32.914]  Whether Trump stays true or not,
[00:08:33.474 --> 00:08:40.157]  We have dealt vicious death blows to world government and the corporate crime syndicate's plans.
[00:08:40.717 --> 00:08:43.458]  Thank you for joining us for this worldwide transmission.
[00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:46.520]  Wednesday, the 21st day of December, 2016.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:53.543]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and this is The Info War.
[00:08:53.983 --> 00:09:02.147]  The epic struggle against the New World Order anti-human crime syndicate is now going into high gear.
[00:09:03.207 --> 00:09:08.772]  Our attacks against the globalist scum are only going to intensify.
[00:09:09.193 --> 00:09:12.035]  Get ready and get used to victory.
[00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:25.988]  The theme of 2016 has been the triumph of individual will coming together for destiny.
[00:09:27.205 --> 00:09:27.866]  On our side.
[00:09:28.566 --> 00:09:33.489]  On the enemy side, it has been one of abject delusion and arrogance.
[00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:40.774]  The enemy's confidence is one of its greatest weaknesses.
[00:09:41.675 --> 00:09:44.117]  And they're about to learn that in spades.
[00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:46.630]  Where do we begin today?
[00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.911]  There is so much to cover.
[00:09:48.271 --> 00:10:01.402]  Michelle Obama has crawled out from under her White House rock to join Oprah, the poor victim that's made billions in America, embraced by white America, pushing her race-baiting garbage.
[00:10:02.042 --> 00:10:05.265]  Michelle Obama compares Americans to toddlers.
[00:10:07.116 --> 00:10:10.477]  She says toddlers hit their head and then you're sad for them.
[00:10:10.497 --> 00:10:12.818]  We're going to play that clip coming up, that we're dumb.
[00:10:13.218 --> 00:10:22.722]  We're like year and a half, two year olds or so, 18 month olds, two months olds, stumbling around, falling down when we voted for Trump.
[00:10:23.462 --> 00:10:25.223]  I thought the Russians stole the election.
[00:10:25.263 --> 00:10:26.523]  I thought the FBI did it.
[00:10:27.023 --> 00:10:29.904]  Oh, now we're toddlers, Michelle.
[00:10:30.545 --> 00:10:35.787]  And of course, Michelle and Obama and the Clintons and others are saying that Trump can't run a government.
[00:10:35.867 --> 00:10:39.728]  No, no, he's not a community organizer that never worked a day in his life.
[00:10:39.768 --> 00:10:40.168]  He's not.
[00:10:40.528 --> 00:10:41.649]  He's not Michael Moore.
[00:10:42.429 --> 00:10:43.109]  No, no, no.
[00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:09.944]  Against the total New World Order media spin machine and both political parties and foreign money flooding in to stop him.
[00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:14.286]  And he's a loser that doesn't know how to captain the Republic.
[00:11:16.726 --> 00:11:20.828]  And now they're talking about, oh this venture he did was a failure, that venture.
[00:11:21.568 --> 00:11:26.190]  Trump has set up, I looked it up, over 400 corporations in his life.
[00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:28.567]  By the way, I've set up more than 30.
[00:11:29.548 --> 00:11:32.530]  And, of course, the public that isn't in business thinks that's a dirty word.
[00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.513]  No, there are some corrupt, big, out-of-control, globalist corporations funding a takeover.
[00:11:36.773 --> 00:11:37.573]  We're fighting them.
[00:11:38.134 --> 00:11:44.719]  But a corporation is just a venture so that individuals don't have liability if it falls apart to a certain extent.
[00:11:45.259 --> 00:11:46.480]  Every time I made a film,
[00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.611]  I went out and got insurance on it.
[00:11:50.071 --> 00:12:08.142]  Every time I did, errors and omissions insurance, every time, I would set up a corporation, at least once I'd made four or five of them and knew what I was doing, show that I would make the investment on a film that might cost me $300,000, $400,000, and then if it failed, the rest of my fledgling operation wouldn't go under.
[00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:17.155]  And Trump has declared bankruptcy three times out of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of successful ventures.
[00:12:17.516 --> 00:12:20.658]  You know in small businesses roughly 80% fail.
[00:12:21.138 --> 00:12:21.879]  You know that, right?
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:32.627]  And the top people in business out there will tell you they have failed over and over and over again, coming up short, but finally making it.
[00:12:33.541 --> 00:12:35.303]  They might fail three or four times and then make it.
[00:12:35.763 --> 00:12:39.747]  They might lose everything and then gain it back in the next venture, or maybe five ventures later.
[00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.192]  I personally have only had a few ventures fail.
[00:12:45.752 --> 00:12:46.713]  Most people have had many.
[00:12:46.973 --> 00:12:48.375]  But again, they target the public.
[00:12:48.415 --> 00:12:49.676]  Most people work for somebody else.
[00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:50.517]  They don't know now.
[00:12:50.837 --> 00:12:53.820]  They've taken the greatest nation of entrepreneurs and inverted that.
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.123]  We're a nation of debtors, a nation of people working for other folks.
[00:12:58.684 --> 00:12:59.025]  And now,
[00:13:00.182 --> 00:13:04.085]  They make it some type of weakness that Trump declared bankruptcy three times.
[00:13:05.046 --> 00:13:06.027]  No, the venture failed.
[00:13:06.047 --> 00:13:08.188]  He would declare bankruptcy on those debts.
[00:13:08.248 --> 00:13:10.570]  You compartmentalize your debts.
[00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.572]  You don't put them all in one basket.
[00:13:12.872 --> 00:13:19.257]  Just what Trump wants to do on trade deals, not some mega massive 20,000 page secret agreement that transfers power.
[00:13:19.538 --> 00:13:21.679]  We're going to do deals one at a time.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.581]  One at a time.
[00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:24.902]  That's how you get the best deals.
[00:13:27.551 --> 00:13:31.632]  You're ever in business and somebody's got some big, giant, complex deal that's gonna be the best thing ever?
[00:13:32.052 --> 00:13:33.593]  You better run, not walk.
[00:13:34.733 --> 00:13:35.734]  And what has Trump done?
[00:13:36.054 --> 00:13:40.035]  Michelle, as you say, he's the biggest booby on the block.
[00:13:40.935 --> 00:13:43.656]  By the way, for our Christian conservative audience, that doesn't mean breast.
[00:13:44.276 --> 00:13:48.057]  Booby is the name of South China Sea pirates.
[00:13:49.178 --> 00:13:54.319]  That's where we get the term of, you look like a bunch of boobies, if you're not dressed conservatively.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:55.480]  U.S.
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.020]  economic
[00:13:57.833 --> 00:14:07.525]  Confidence surges to the highest level that Gallup in a hundred plus years has ever recorded.
[00:14:07.545 --> 00:14:12.231]  And they're already announcing they're going to raise interest rates.
[00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:14.533]  They've already done it once to try to stall this.
[00:14:15.765 --> 00:14:20.887]  I've been critical of the low interest rates because it's impossible to fix things in a non-growth economy with zero interest rates.
[00:14:20.907 --> 00:14:25.369]  If you're going to have zero and turn the economy on, it's the way to go for at least three years.
[00:14:25.429 --> 00:14:27.910]  Then you better back off because it will blow like a bubble.
[00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.991]  But to get us out of cardiac arrest, put those amphibulators on us, Trump.
[00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:33.692]  Zero, zero is what we need.
[00:14:34.032 --> 00:14:35.773]  Under old stuff, we needed to raise interest rates.
[00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:42.736]  That would at least give investors, small-time investors, a chance to get something going and people that have money that are saving some type of return.
[00:14:43.775 --> 00:14:51.077]  But now, that it's not just Global that's going to give themselves all the 0% money, it's time for the people to get some of that, and Trump wants to keep it low.
[00:14:51.097 --> 00:14:54.838]  Uh-uh-uh, they say, oh, the economy's overheating.
[00:14:55.198 --> 00:14:57.379]  Trump's been president-elect for 40 days.
[00:14:58.059 --> 00:15:00.880]  He'll be in in 29, and we can't allow an overheating.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:06.841]  So we're just going to have to raise it maybe two or three more times before he gets in, hoping it ends this Trump run.
[00:15:08.662 --> 00:15:11.783]  That's not going to work, because there's over a trillion dollars conservatively.
[00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:13.225]  That's public.
[00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:22.248]  A lot more in foreign bank accounts in the Bahamas and Spain and Luxembourg and Monte Carlo and obviously many other places.
[00:15:22.668 --> 00:15:26.429]  But all the public money's over a trill that wants to come back.
[00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:33.811]  And as soon as we cut that corporate income tax, which has got to be his number one mission, to the global average, it's got to be the highest of any major nation.
[00:15:34.778 --> 00:15:37.239]  You know, fact check will go, well there are a few countries that have higher.
[00:15:37.259 --> 00:15:42.441]  Yeah, but of big wealthy nations, we are 15 points above the average.
[00:15:43.662 --> 00:15:46.803]  You cut, Trump wants to go below, which by the way is a trade war.
[00:15:47.764 --> 00:15:48.604]  I kind of like that idea.
[00:15:48.624 --> 00:15:50.045]  We've been getting screwed by China so long.
[00:15:50.065 --> 00:15:50.605]  Let's go ahead.
[00:15:50.645 --> 00:15:51.385]  They're getting pushy.
[00:15:51.765 --> 00:15:52.846]  They're grabbing our submarines.
[00:15:52.866 --> 00:15:54.086]  They're getting, they're shooting their mouths off.
[00:15:54.406 --> 00:15:55.807]  How about we go five points below them?
[00:15:55.847 --> 00:15:59.388]  But Congress is ready to vote right now to equalize it.
[00:15:59.789 --> 00:16:00.309]  Totally fair.
[00:16:03.422 --> 00:16:08.184]  Heritage Foundation says if we don't have higher taxes on other people, it's not fair.
[00:16:08.224 --> 00:16:09.505]  No, no, that's a screw job.
[00:16:09.525 --> 00:16:14.707]  In fact, I had a libertarian guy from Vice go, you're not being free market wanting to lower the income tax on corporations.
[00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:19.989]  And I went, wait a minute, if China's got a 15% higher, how is it not fair to lower it to the same amount?
[00:16:20.029 --> 00:16:21.189]  He goes, I guess you got a point.
[00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.871]  I said, yeah, man, stop spewing Heritage Foundation stuff at me, please, please.
[00:16:26.692 --> 00:16:31.474]  Well, it's kind of, you know, crony capitalist to, you know, do deals just for America.
[00:16:32.054 --> 00:16:34.255]  We've been having it one-sided forever.
[00:16:34.355 --> 00:16:37.076]  It's not crony capitalism.
[00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:40.498]  Crony capitalism is not letting us compete so we can be controlled.
[00:16:41.118 --> 00:16:41.898]  It's ending.
[00:16:42.338 --> 00:16:43.339]  That's why they're so mad.
[00:16:43.379 --> 00:16:48.501]  The globalists have been selling off this country and talking about what geniuses they are for decades.
[00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:57.925]  No, what you are is a bunch of backstabbing traitors that sold out the country that had over half the world's wealth till you got control of it.
[00:16:59.865 --> 00:17:00.926]  Oh yeah, comprende that.
[00:17:02.532 --> 00:17:02.812]  U.S.
[00:17:02.852 --> 00:17:08.494]  economic confidence surges to the highest level that Gallup has ever recorded.
[00:17:08.574 --> 00:17:12.535]  Infowars.com, Michael Snyder article, Gallup's U.S.
[00:17:12.575 --> 00:17:16.376]  economic confidence index has never been higher than it is today.
[00:17:17.837 --> 00:17:19.237]  That's the Trump euphoria.
[00:17:21.493 --> 00:17:25.117]  People always say, oh, Wall Street's pure evil on the left, on the right.
[00:17:25.157 --> 00:17:26.279]  No, Wall Street can do no wrong.
[00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:26.959]  No.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:40.035]  Big mega banks and big brokerage firms that are above the law, pushing gun control, pushing globalism, pushing transferring our sovereignty into international bodies, they control, is conquest, is crony capitalism, is wrong.
[00:17:41.135 --> 00:17:48.061]  But most of Wall Street is middle and small-time firms, and even some big ones that are family-owned, controlled that do want prosperity.
[00:17:48.141 --> 00:17:50.503]  And they're doubling down on Trump.
[00:17:50.623 --> 00:17:51.864]  They want the prosperity.
[00:17:52.124 --> 00:17:52.965]  They want the boom.
[00:17:53.185 --> 00:17:54.186]  They want the tax cuts.
[00:17:54.286 --> 00:18:00.611]  And the word is, Trump's going to freeze spending in the first year just to stabilize things.
[00:18:00.671 --> 00:18:03.474]  And he is intending by year four to begin cutting.
[00:18:04.014 --> 00:18:06.096]  And by the way, what he wants to do, he's going to try.
[00:18:06.356 --> 00:18:07.057]  This shouldn't talk.
[00:18:08.001 --> 00:18:12.347]  You're going to see, if he gets his way and we get behind him, cutting spending.
[00:18:14.292 --> 00:18:17.293]  Moderately, it's not going to be big.
[00:18:17.373 --> 00:18:18.873]  Even Ron Paul says we've got to wean off this.
[00:18:19.393 --> 00:18:24.095]  Cutting spending while revenue swells for building projects.
[00:18:24.355 --> 00:18:39.519]  And of course, Krugman is flipping out today, saying this is an administration of white nationalists and we don't need make work projects and infrastructure because it looks like he's hiring people that are going to privatize.
[00:18:39.859 --> 00:18:41.179]  That's what you've been doing, chump.
[00:18:42.745 --> 00:18:46.387]  Giving the contracts to private companies is how we're going to get the jobs going.
[00:18:47.447 --> 00:18:51.189]  Not just shipping it overseas or paying off debts that don't exist.
[00:18:51.209 --> 00:18:56.011]  You know, all these monolithic fiat derivatives debts that should just be triaged.
[00:18:57.492 --> 00:18:57.752]  U.S.
[00:18:57.812 --> 00:19:02.134]  economic confidence surge is the highest level that Gallup has ever recorded.
[00:19:03.535 --> 00:19:04.215]  Gallup's U.S.
[00:19:04.255 --> 00:19:07.737]  economic confidence index has never been higher than it is today.
[00:19:08.675 --> 00:19:15.200]  And if, folks, everything is confidence, we have the economy, we can rebuild it, we can do it, but not if they sabotage it.
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:32.854]  And if Trump gets sabotaged, or they kill him, or they bring out more scandals and start an impeachment, as the New York Times called for yesterday, the day after he beat them trying to overturn the electors, then we all can look in the mirror for why we didn't turn this country around.
[00:19:34.264 --> 00:19:35.646]  Trump euphoria it's being called.
[00:19:36.086 --> 00:19:38.669]  We're going to come back and break all this down straight ahead.
[00:19:38.689 --> 00:19:39.710]  This is exciting.
[00:19:40.311 --> 00:19:42.052]  And it's what he and Bannon promised to do.
[00:19:42.513 --> 00:19:43.434]  It's Bannon's plan.
[00:19:43.834 --> 00:19:44.715]  Trump's plan as well.
[00:19:45.516 --> 00:19:46.597]  It's the Americana plan.
[00:19:46.657 --> 00:19:47.278]  It always worked.
[00:19:47.298 --> 00:19:48.359]  It threatened the whole planet.
[00:19:48.379 --> 00:19:52.323]  It was run by dictators and scum because everybody said, hey, can't we be like that?
[00:19:53.084 --> 00:20:01.027]  We're about to turn loose the American worker, the American entrepreneur, every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood on terra firma.
[00:20:01.727 --> 00:20:02.948]  This is a big transmission.
[00:20:03.008 --> 00:20:03.988]  I'm wound up.
[00:20:04.769 --> 00:20:06.829]  And I'm coming out of the gate hot, straight ahead.
[00:20:06.849 --> 00:20:07.330]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:10.407 --> 00:20:15.190]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:22.413]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:25.075]  I started to exercise really hard again.
[00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:31.140]  And I started to try to eat healthier, started taking third party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[00:20:31.681 --> 00:20:42.091]  But when I started working with Dr. Grip and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[00:20:42.231 --> 00:20:42.491]  Boom!
[00:20:42.892 --> 00:20:46.335]  Weight started pouring off, toxins started coming out of my body.
[00:20:46.795 --> 00:20:47.956]  Then, by early 2016,
[00:20:50.018 --> 00:20:53.200]  I was in the best shape of my life since I've been in really good shape in my 20s.
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.461]  But the election heated up.
[00:20:54.501 --> 00:20:56.882]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:20:57.002 --> 00:21:06.248]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:21:06.448 --> 00:21:07.428]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:21:07.608 --> 00:21:11.291]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:21:12.091 --> 00:21:14.232]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again.
[00:21:14.932 --> 00:21:18.154]  And I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.534]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:21:19.594 --> 00:21:23.196]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:21:23.396 --> 00:21:24.317]  It's December 5th, 2016.
[00:21:24.437 --> 00:21:28.278]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:21:28.498 --> 00:21:38.463]  And I want to invite all of the info warriors of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:21:41.502 --> 00:21:46.485]  One of the most common questions I get is, you've changed the whole radio TV model.
[00:21:47.266 --> 00:21:48.006]  How did you do it?
[00:21:48.066 --> 00:21:49.627]  Did an ad agency teach you that?
[00:21:49.647 --> 00:21:50.968]  Or what book did you read?
[00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:52.810]  And the answer is, it was trial and error.
[00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:58.393]  I promote products that I personally use, like the Nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com.
[00:21:58.874 --> 00:22:00.695]  And it's the same thing for this promotion.
[00:22:01.195 --> 00:22:02.536]  I didn't get this from an ad agency.
[00:22:02.576 --> 00:22:03.777]  I didn't just think this up.
[00:22:04.277 --> 00:22:04.958]  I was sitting there.
[00:22:04.998 --> 00:22:11.122]  I'd gained probably 10, 15 pounds because I've gotten out of the habit of taking the supplements in the last few months for the election.
[00:22:11.882 --> 00:22:21.931]  And I was thinking, wow, I need to religiously take these, because I'm promoting these things, it's making me healthier, and if I'm not taking them, you know, I'm fatter, plus people aren't going to buy the product.
[00:22:22.452 --> 00:22:25.594]  So that's where the promotion comes from, is purely from reality.
[00:22:25.935 --> 00:22:32.761]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:35.243]  I've lost five pounds.
[00:22:35.723 --> 00:22:36.404]  We're good to go.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.502]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[00:22:59.962 --> 00:23:01.202]  So I'm eating worse.
[00:23:01.843 --> 00:23:09.206]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost five pounds.
[00:23:09.366 --> 00:23:09.886]  It's incredible.
[00:23:10.907 --> 00:23:12.848]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[00:23:13.068 --> 00:23:14.329]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[00:23:14.449 --> 00:23:16.850]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:18.350]  This is an experiment.
[00:23:18.451 --> 00:23:19.211]  Everybody's watching.
[00:23:19.451 --> 00:23:20.271]  We'll see what happens.
[00:23:20.712 --> 00:23:21.852]  This is part two.
[00:23:22.693 --> 00:23:23.693]  Next week, part three.
[00:23:24.393 --> 00:23:24.974]  That's a good point.
[00:23:25.794 --> 00:23:34.920]  We just cut there and Rob Deuce said, hey Alex, I know you don't follow script, but you might want to add to people, we're running some of the biggest specials of the year until December 17th.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.924]  That's the last day that you can get your order in and have guaranteed shipping anywhere in the United States.
[00:23:41.104 --> 00:23:42.845]  And we have some of the biggest specials of the year.
[00:23:42.865 --> 00:23:45.407]  50% off many of the Nutraceuticals.
[00:23:45.727 --> 00:23:46.608]  The lowest discount is 25%.
[00:23:46.648 --> 00:23:46.768]  30% off X2.
[00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:53.974]  Huge discounts and free shipping store-wide on every product.
[00:23:54.034 --> 00:23:54.915]  Thousands of items.
[00:23:55.335 --> 00:23:59.719]  And on top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip, an additional 10% off.
[00:23:59.759 --> 00:24:03.122]  And I'm going to do one more bad thing, because I'm politically correct.
[00:24:03.623 --> 00:24:04.724]  Or I guess I'm politically incorrect.
[00:24:05.164 --> 00:24:07.206]  And that's to say, Merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:24:07.526 --> 00:24:08.707]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:24:08.767 --> 00:24:09.348]  You're awesome.
[00:24:25.998 --> 00:24:30.243]  Wanna wish you all a wonderful Christmas?
[00:24:42.992 --> 00:24:55.640]  I wish all the Christians out there a great holiday as well and hope that you will remember that your establishment-run churches are helping subvert this country and keep Christians from actually taking action against evil.
[00:24:56.081 --> 00:25:01.744]  If you're in a church that's actually fighting the New World Order and fighting the abortuaries, then you're a lucky person.
[00:25:01.764 --> 00:25:02.205]  You're blessed.
[00:25:02.845 --> 00:25:09.950]  A lot of them are state-run now and they should be recognized as the abode of devils that they are, in my humble opinion.
[00:25:11.397 --> 00:25:17.683]  Behind me, if you're watching on television, is the image of the Christmas tree down by the state capitol here in Austin, Texas, where we originate from.
[00:25:18.304 --> 00:25:18.984]  Very, very beautiful.
[00:25:19.585 --> 00:25:32.658]  You gotta realize that evil people, scum, the fascistic left, the authoritarian control freak oligarchs, the jihadis, the orthodox islamists, all over the world, from Syria to Iraq,
[00:25:33.888 --> 00:25:40.757]  To the United States, to Europe are attacking, blowing up Christmas trees, stabbing people, running over children with cars.
[00:25:41.658 --> 00:25:43.821]  And I've got stacks of news and videos here.
[00:25:44.986 --> 00:26:03.570]  Or CNN, MSNBC, and everybody else is defending the attacks in Europe, saying that, you know, basically the Russian ambassador deserved to die because of Aleppo, and that, you know, Germany's done bad things to the Muslims, so they deserve it, and that it's not Muslims.
[00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:06.551]  In fact, Chris Hayes and others are saying this is not a jihad attack.
[00:26:07.611 --> 00:26:13.573]  MSNBC's Chris Hayes works double time to make Berlin and Turkey attacks not seem like terrorism,
[00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:15.451]  That's coming up.
[00:26:15.491 --> 00:26:22.498]  If you go to DrudgeReport.com, you can see the headline, Berlin Manhunt as Killer Escapes Europe on Xmas Alert.
[00:26:22.678 --> 00:26:26.922]  And he is a Islamist, of course, just like the other suspect was.
[00:26:27.623 --> 00:26:29.184]  And he's trying to flee Europe, they're reporting.
[00:26:29.765 --> 00:26:31.407]  And they're blurring out his face.
[00:26:31.447 --> 00:26:38.414]  The police released, and the government released, an image of him, and the media, I guess, blurred it out.
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.041]  So Paul Watson's been asking on Twitter why they're blurring out his face.
[00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:44.122]  We're not blurring out his face.
[00:26:44.222 --> 00:26:44.782]  Most wanted.
[00:26:44.842 --> 00:26:46.603]  He was the guy that had the truck, was the driver.
[00:26:47.043 --> 00:26:48.304]  Police revealed they are hunting.
[00:26:48.324 --> 00:26:50.064]  Here, let's scroll down and read his name.
[00:26:50.505 --> 00:26:50.865]  Anis?
[00:26:51.725 --> 00:26:53.986]  Or is that Anis Amir?
[00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:54.926]  Anis Amir.
[00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:57.387]  I think that is Anis Amir.
[00:26:57.407 --> 00:26:58.028]  What a nice name.
[00:26:59.108 --> 00:26:59.868]  Anis Amir.
[00:27:00.008 --> 00:27:01.209]  That's A-N-I-S.
[00:27:01.449 --> 00:27:03.210]  Anis Amir.
[00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.210]  23.
[00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:04.730]  Just look at that guy.
[00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.111]  He just looks like he's mentally ill.
[00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:14.776]  He stood up, he just stood up to the evil Germans out drinking hot chocolate and eggnog under Christmas trees with their kids.
[00:27:14.816 --> 00:27:17.518]  He reportedly, allegedly ran over them.
[00:27:17.558 --> 00:27:22.982]  He's the guy identified as the person in the truck, had the truck, was the truck driver.
[00:27:24.283 --> 00:27:28.947]  So the media seized on him with, oh, the police have the wrong guy, a refugee there in the country.
[00:27:29.127 --> 00:27:30.068]  Oh, wait, it's another one.
[00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:32.670]  Well, let's just move along.
[00:27:35.097 --> 00:27:38.981]  We need to have armed guards around Christmas displays around the country.
[00:27:40.763 --> 00:27:44.246]  Like the guy that wanted to blow up a Christmas tree in Portland.
[00:27:47.309 --> 00:27:48.810]  Then the FBI was ordered not to stop him.
[00:27:50.512 --> 00:27:52.194]  But then they basically bucked the orders and did.
[00:27:54.073 --> 00:27:58.717]  See, that'd be a false flag on top, letting them attack, but when the FBI actually does their job and stops it, it's no longer a false flag.
[00:27:58.737 --> 00:28:00.278]  A lot of other types of false flags.
[00:28:00.298 --> 00:28:01.780]  A false flag is not just a pure attack.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:08.846]  When our government opens the borders up and lets these people in unvetted, that is Obama, he is then aiding and abetting in an attack on our country.
[00:28:08.886 --> 00:28:10.407]  That is a false flag by the globalists.
[00:28:11.128 --> 00:28:15.612]  But it's our own government that is actually at the grassroots level trying to fight it and expose it.
[00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.791]  When I had Vice here yesterday for HBO, they were doing paradoxes.
[00:28:19.811 --> 00:28:23.871]  Well, wait, you say that there's Islamic terrorism, but you're then saying the government's behind it.
[00:28:23.891 --> 00:28:27.132]  And I'm saying criminals in our government are allied with it.
[00:28:27.792 --> 00:28:30.652]  The Pentagon believes the head of the CIA is a Wahhabist.
[00:28:31.013 --> 00:28:33.953]  He certainly lived in Saudi Arabia off and on for two decades.
[00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:35.553]  Brennan.
[00:28:38.494 --> 00:28:42.495]  And nobody else is saying the Russians were involved in the election but him, and then giving no proof.
[00:28:42.955 --> 00:28:44.275]  Just a little side issue.
[00:28:45.250 --> 00:29:03.080]  But before I get into all this and a bunch of clips in the next segment, how big a deal is it that they had all these fake polls, tried to steal the election, Trump still had a big victory, they claim he lost the popular vote, but they admit that they've got illegals voting all over the country and people voting in the name of dead people.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.742]  Safe to say Trump won that as well, but look at the reality.
[00:29:06.762 --> 00:29:07.743]  30, 40, 50,000 people in crowds, Hillary with 300.
[00:29:11.468 --> 00:29:18.091]  And now Trump keeps going up in popularity in Gallup, and you know it's a lot higher than even what they're saying on how they go after demographics.
[00:29:18.191 --> 00:29:25.674]  And then now, the highest economic outlook, the highest confidence ever.
[00:29:27.255 --> 00:29:30.877]  Restaurants have gone from almost closing to saying they're busting at the seams.
[00:29:32.217 --> 00:29:34.738]  Suddenly factory orders, all sorts of stuff's happening.
[00:29:34.759 --> 00:29:37.820]  60 billion in jobs already coming back.
[00:29:39.983 --> 00:29:55.353]  From high-tech to oil drilling to steel manufacturing and just, it's just a surge of, it's okay to be patriotic again, it's okay to want to buy American again, and I'm telling you, I'm thinking about doing what Salente was saying, I'm thinking about getting with a factory here in the U.S.
[00:29:55.413 --> 00:29:57.535]  and putting on American-made shoes or something.
[00:29:57.775 --> 00:29:59.556]  I want to, I want to jump on the bandwagon.
[00:29:59.576 --> 00:30:02.378]  Because we actually created the bandwagon, but you know what I mean.
[00:30:02.658 --> 00:30:03.839]  This is exciting.
[00:30:03.879 --> 00:30:06.680]  We should all pile on, make America great again.
[00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:08.582]  Ha ha ha, yeah!
[00:30:10.237 --> 00:30:17.602]  Social media platforms are coming under fire as families of the Orlando nightclub shooting victims are suing Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
[00:30:17.723 --> 00:30:26.269]  And the federal complaint argues that these web platforms, quote, provided terrorist group support for ISIS and the accounts they used to spread extremist propaganda.
[00:30:26.329 --> 00:30:37.477]  The families of these victims of the Orlando gay nightclub shooting on Monday this week filed a federal lawsuit against Twitter, Facebook, and Google for allegedly providing, quote, material support to ISIS.
[00:30:37.737 --> 00:30:40.219]  And helping them radicalize shooter Omar Mateen.
[00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:43.161]  In this complaint, it was filed in the Eastern District of Michigan.
[00:30:43.221 --> 00:30:58.253]  The families of Tevin Crosby, Javier George Reyes, and Juan Rey Moguero, they argue that the three web platforms provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts they used to spread extremist propaganda, raise funds, and attract new recruits like Omar Mateen.
[00:30:58.293 --> 00:31:06.619]  Now, we've seen Facebook come under fire recently for censoring real news, but it looks like they're giving a platform to ISIS, and victims' families are saying no more.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:07.500]  I'm Margaret Halverd
[00:31:10.142 --> 00:31:13.985]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:21.592]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable grape-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:31:21.772 --> 00:31:32.901]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:31:33.201 --> 00:31:40.745]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:31:41.045 --> 00:31:44.768]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today.
[00:31:44.928 --> 00:31:54.893]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:31:55.133 --> 00:32:01.817]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:32:02.097 --> 00:32:04.079]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[00:32:04.099 --> 00:32:07.523]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:32:07.543 --> 00:32:08.884]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:32:25.189 --> 00:32:27.410]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.650]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.891]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:32:32.871 --> 00:32:33.211]  Or more.
[00:32:33.311 --> 00:32:35.192]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:32:35.732 --> 00:32:37.192]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:32:37.312 --> 00:32:40.673]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:32:40.773 --> 00:32:42.534]  It's actually scary.
[00:32:43.414 --> 00:32:53.498]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:32:54.498 --> 00:33:07.303]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[00:33:12.508 --> 00:33:27.182]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:53.267 --> 00:33:57.109]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:57.129 --> 00:34:00.451]  Thank you so much for joining us on this 21st day of December 2016.
[00:34:01.092 --> 00:34:06.535]  Hard to believe we're about to be in 2017.
[00:34:08.236 --> 00:34:13.659]  And the InfoWars anti-globalist Americana era begins.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.241]  We're gonna have to fight for it.
[00:34:17.881 --> 00:34:18.702]  Make no mistake.
[00:34:21.274 --> 00:34:23.055]  But hey, Americans love to fight, don't we?
[00:34:25.056 --> 00:34:25.856]  And we love to win.
[00:34:25.916 --> 00:34:30.078]  And I gotta tell ya, I'm never gonna get sick of winning.
[00:34:30.098 --> 00:34:32.839]  And I'm never gonna get sick of fighting.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.323]  And I've come here to kick ass and chew bubblegum and to quote the immortal Rowdy Rowdy Piper, I'm all out of bubblegum.
[00:34:44.625 --> 00:34:47.246]  Nothing, except the good Lord above, can stop
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:57.647]  Human ingenuity, human drive, human will, human passion, human love, when we have a focus and know it's for our species.
[00:34:59.829 --> 00:35:06.134]  And that's why the globalists have done everything they can to demoralize us and make us feel weak.
[00:35:07.295 --> 00:35:14.721]  We're breaking their will now, and they can feel it economically, culturally, and spiritually most important.
[00:35:18.188 --> 00:35:21.891]  All right, let me just calm down and get to all this news because it is just over-the-top important.
[00:35:23.252 --> 00:35:23.993]  Let me know where to start.
[00:35:27.616 --> 00:35:33.040]  Let me just set the table with how the enemy's trying to break our will and how they're now having to reverse themselves more and more.
[00:35:35.242 --> 00:35:43.589]  Chris Hayes has come out and tried to whitewash the Islamic terror, hitting Christmas parties, hitting the Russian ambassador and others in Europe.
[00:35:47.486 --> 00:36:04.454]  They're also trying to triple down on the race baiting to put minority groups and whites and others into their own little boxes to fear each other and to politically not come together around prosperity and populism.
[00:36:05.094 --> 00:36:08.536]  It is a desperate attempt at sabotage and they admit that it's not working.
[00:36:09.156 --> 00:36:14.379]  Yesterday MTV put up a super hardcore
[00:36:16.681 --> 00:36:31.714]  racist message that we're going to be playing here today that is resolutions for white guys.
[00:36:33.556 --> 00:36:37.840]  Now they've had former videos on this same show
[00:36:40.742 --> 00:36:49.107]  Where they say, attention white guys, and they say, you've caused the murder, you've caused the criminality, you are the bad people in the world, despite the fact that history doesn't show that.
[00:36:50.468 --> 00:36:53.670]  In the sum, it shows the opposite.
[00:36:54.871 --> 00:36:57.233]  It's just with modern technology, the death tolls have been higher.
[00:36:57.653 --> 00:37:04.837]  The highest death tolls of any population have been committed by the Chinese communists, and throughout history, it's been committed by the Chinese.
[00:37:05.158 --> 00:37:08.580]  The Chinese are the all-time biggest killers of their own people.
[00:37:11.365 --> 00:37:16.787]  It's over 100 million since 1949 when Mao took over all of China.
[00:37:16.807 --> 00:37:21.089]  It's estimated he probably killed about 10 million Chinese before that.
[00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:24.431]  We're talking well over 100 mil.
[00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:34.135]  If you'd like me to walk through what's happened in other places where non-Anglos engage in mass murder of their own people or wars, I'd be more than happy to.
[00:37:37.295 --> 00:37:50.840]  But MTV publicly shames whites, and under psychology, it shows them apologizing for what they've done to America, and apologizing for things their ancestors didn't even do.
[00:37:51.301 --> 00:37:52.641]  Total mental illness!
[00:37:52.741 --> 00:38:01.765]  But now, MTV went too far with the weaponization, and Sumner Redstone's anti-American operation had to pull back.
[00:38:03.444 --> 00:38:04.844]  That's coming up in a moment as well.
[00:38:05.224 --> 00:38:13.167]  They have expunged this, but under fair use, under the public's right to know, the weaponized media being targeted, we have the video.
[00:38:16.947 --> 00:38:18.388]  We're going to be playing that in a moment.
[00:38:19.408 --> 00:38:25.150]  But understand this, we've got 12 dead, 60-plus injured, others may die, unfortunately, in Berlin.
[00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:29.991]  We've got 89 dead in Nice, hundreds injured.
[00:38:30.987 --> 00:38:35.690]  And we had media back then that for a week wouldn't say it was Islamic attack.
[00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.191]  They called it a truck attack.
[00:38:37.771 --> 00:38:44.055]  Here they had to admit it very, very early because witnesses said they saw Middle Eastern looking guy get out of it and run off.
[00:38:44.375 --> 00:38:47.317]  They grabbed another illegal invader.
[00:38:48.178 --> 00:38:54.261]  They let him go after 20 hours interrogation and now they said they have the name of the guy and the identity and the face of who did it.
[00:38:54.562 --> 00:38:56.603]  And I covered that earlier, we can put that on screen.
[00:38:57.163 --> 00:38:59.725]  But the media is blurring out his face hoping he doesn't get caught.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:14.127]  Tunisian asylum seeker, 23, suspected of carrying out a burglary massacre, was arrested three times this year amid fears he was planning a terror plot, but police let him go and are now offering 100,000 euros to anyone who finds him.
[00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:17.349]  And there he is!
[00:39:17.429 --> 00:39:19.190]  His name is Anas Amir.
[00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:21.851]  Actually, it's Anas Amir.
[00:39:22.112 --> 00:39:23.312]  Shouldn't insult anuses.
[00:39:24.653 --> 00:39:27.535]  There's some beautiful butts out there, a lot better looking than his face, I gotta tell you.
[00:39:27.555 --> 00:39:29.916]  I've seen horses' asses that look better than him.
[00:39:31.411 --> 00:39:33.553]  He actually looks like a deformed elephant butt.
[00:39:35.074 --> 00:39:36.335]  Maybe his mother was an elephant.
[00:39:38.037 --> 00:39:40.459]  The point is, people are sick.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:46.644]  In fact, let's trigger everybody that's watching that's not a patriot or who's living in some mind control cult.
[00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:48.405]  Let's put up the Texas Christmas tree.
[00:39:49.166 --> 00:39:50.167]  Oh, we can put him up there too.
[00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:51.148]  What a little wimp.
[00:39:52.763 --> 00:39:54.144]  He didn't go attack a military target.
[00:39:54.164 --> 00:39:55.125]  He didn't go attack men.
[00:39:55.826 --> 00:39:57.827]  He ran over a bunch of people at a Christmas party.
[00:39:58.868 --> 00:39:59.989]  Outdoors, under the stars.
[00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:01.390]  Just another coward.
[00:40:02.471 --> 00:40:07.395]  Like his brethren that ran over the three-year-olds running, screaming, Mommy, Mommy.
[00:40:08.295 --> 00:40:10.497]  Direct shades of Mad Max.
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.762]  And everyone in Europe's wondering why this happened.
[00:40:16.782 --> 00:40:17.443]  We bring you here.
[00:40:17.463 --> 00:40:18.363]  We give everything free.
[00:40:18.423 --> 00:40:21.586]  We throw out old Germans out of their Section 8 housing.
[00:40:23.362 --> 00:40:32.568]  In Italy, they're throwing people out of hospital beds and out of hotels to house all the beautiful chosen people of Islam.
[00:40:33.508 --> 00:40:35.270]  Oh, and where's the outrage of Islam?
[00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:44.595]  There's a big article out of the Southern Poverty Law Center that, by the way, law enforcement for five years doesn't even use anymore, because they got caught running Elohim City and other operations.
[00:40:45.016 --> 00:40:46.276]  Law enforcement knows who they are now.
[00:40:47.597 --> 00:40:50.039]  They say General Flynn, former head
[00:40:51.758 --> 00:40:57.700]  of Defense Intelligence who exposed the Al-Qaeda-ISIS system Obama and Hillary were running, and who helped stop it.
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.120]  Super smart guy, listener of this show, obviously.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.001]  They know that.
[00:41:02.541 --> 00:41:03.301]  He tweets our stuff.
[00:41:03.721 --> 00:41:04.261]  Leave it at that.
[00:41:05.842 --> 00:41:12.523]  They keep calling him a kook and a weirdo, and then they say, he says Islam will not coexist with us and is trying to take over.
[00:41:12.923 --> 00:41:14.904]  He said it's rational to fear Islam.
[00:41:15.885 --> 00:41:26.531]  He said Islam, they quote stuff like he's discredited, and this is stuff he said years ago, some of it a decade ago, and all of it is coming true.
[00:41:26.791 --> 00:41:28.352]  He said Europe will not be Europe by 2050.
[00:41:28.412 --> 00:41:34.415]  This is the kind of stuff he says, it's like General Flynn
[00:41:36.019 --> 00:41:37.380]  Said that the sky is blue.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.381]  General Flynn said fish live in the water.
[00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:41.522]  General Flynn said grass is green.
[00:41:42.263 --> 00:41:44.484]  General Flynn said Rudolph has a red nose.
[00:41:45.004 --> 00:41:47.686]  General Flynn said Superman has a red cape.
[00:41:48.026 --> 00:41:50.787]  General Flynn said bicycles have two wheels.
[00:41:51.808 --> 00:41:52.348]  What a kook!
[00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:56.971]  It's like you read their thing about me.
[00:41:57.131 --> 00:42:00.533]  Jones says there's a plan to open the borders and bring in world government.
[00:42:00.653 --> 00:42:01.313]  It's been announced.
[00:42:01.433 --> 00:42:02.234]  It's done.
[00:42:05.094 --> 00:42:10.777]  But they have to take what's normal, it's psychological warfare, totally normal, totally admitted, and go, look at this, this is insane!
[00:42:11.077 --> 00:42:12.137]  So you're scared to say it.
[00:42:12.398 --> 00:42:13.978]  Why, you might get put on a list.
[00:42:14.279 --> 00:42:17.540]  The Southern Harvard Law Center might attack you!
[00:42:18.641 --> 00:42:19.441]  Chris Hayes!
[00:42:23.183 --> 00:42:26.725]  Might readjust his glasses to make him look like a professor.
[00:42:26.805 --> 00:42:28.986]  I want to readjust my glasses here.
[00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:31.911]  Somebody get me a pair of glasses and a pipe.
[00:42:32.291 --> 00:42:36.114]  Somebody go get me a pair of reading glasses that kind of look professorly.
[00:42:38.255 --> 00:42:41.658]  And a pipe from the local drug store.
[00:42:41.798 --> 00:42:42.699]  They sell them behind the counter.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.621]  In fact, I even want some tobacco.
[00:42:46.862 --> 00:42:48.463]  Some cherry-flavored tobacco for Christmas.
[00:42:48.543 --> 00:42:50.225]  I'm gonna sit here like Chris Hayes.
[00:42:50.345 --> 00:42:51.886]  Let me light my lighter.
[00:42:51.946 --> 00:42:53.327]  There's no Islam here!
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:00.401]  It'd be like walking up to the Taj Mahal and going, I don't see the Taj Mahal here.
[00:43:00.481 --> 00:43:00.981]  Where is it?
[00:43:01.041 --> 00:43:01.921]  It's like right in front of you.
[00:43:03.261 --> 00:43:04.602]  Or watching us on TV right now.
[00:43:04.942 --> 00:43:06.962]  I don't see a Christmas tree here.
[00:43:07.322 --> 00:43:08.302]  Where could it be?
[00:43:09.463 --> 00:43:11.003]  Nowhere here.
[00:43:12.823 --> 00:43:15.264]  Oh, Chris Hayes, you're so intellectual.
[00:43:16.504 --> 00:43:18.024]  You're so metrosexual.
[00:43:19.505 --> 00:43:21.425]  They can't tell who's male, who's female.
[00:43:21.445 --> 00:43:22.345]  You're so modern.
[00:43:22.365 --> 00:43:25.746]  That owl looks like more of a man than you.
[00:43:27.125 --> 00:43:34.167]  Chris Hayes, sustained effort to demonize Trump, no matter how deranged, is the path back to power for Democrats.
[00:43:36.107 --> 00:43:39.008]  Now, he always looks like he's drunk about three bottles of cough syrup.
[00:43:39.128 --> 00:43:41.728]  Just so like, I'm Chris Hayes, going to sleep here.
[00:43:42.768 --> 00:43:49.070]  But let's go ahead and play Chris Hayes, then we'll get to the new MTV video they pulled they don't want you to see.
[00:43:49.889 --> 00:43:54.491]  Where they're actually hyping up... Notice it's always led by white people.
[00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:59.794]  I've actually found it's not really, on average, blacks and Hispanics that are running around all this racist crap.
[00:43:59.814 --> 00:44:02.675]  In fact, I've seen them in the real world just kind of go, this is crazy.
[00:44:02.695 --> 00:44:04.496]  What, are they trying to create racism?
[00:44:04.736 --> 00:44:05.537]  Absolutely.
[00:44:06.017 --> 00:44:09.299]  Because weaker-minded white people watch this and go join the KKK.
[00:44:09.339 --> 00:44:12.780]  I mean, this is... This is crazy town, folks.
[00:44:16.656 --> 00:44:24.059]  You are bad because you're white, you're horrible, and you're weird, and you can't play sports, and you're pathetic, and you can't sing, and you can't dance.
[00:44:24.299 --> 00:44:25.099]  This is all Hollywood.
[00:44:25.159 --> 00:44:25.919]  Whites are scum.
[00:44:26.179 --> 00:44:26.860]  Whites are bad.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:27.860]  Whites are out of style.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:28.980]  Whites are terrible.
[00:44:29.341 --> 00:44:30.541]  Whites are the worst thing in the world.
[00:44:30.561 --> 00:44:35.303]  Even though white people are number 60 or 70, depending on the year, on the economic chart.
[00:44:37.683 --> 00:44:38.864]  Up at the top is Christian.
[00:44:43.413 --> 00:44:56.464]  Folks from the Middle East, and then you move on down from there, Lebanese particularly, then it's Chinese, and Vietnamese, and Koreans, and on and on and on, and then way down here, white people, then black people.
[00:44:58.615 --> 00:45:03.338]  Hispanics aren't as high up as they should be, because on average, it's a well-known demographic, it's not a cliché, it's called a number.
[00:45:03.878 --> 00:45:06.840]  Don't trust banks, don't trust vaccines, don't trust the police or whatever.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.222]  You always hear the government bemoaning that, that's why I mention it.
[00:45:09.442 --> 00:45:12.464]  They don't put their money in banks, but Hispanics are doing quite well as well.
[00:45:12.764 --> 00:45:18.167]  Probably better on average than a lot of whites now, because whites were the dominant economic force, it was all the work ethic.
[00:45:19.228 --> 00:45:26.473]  That's been taken out, and the demographics show whites are nosediving since the 80s, like blacks started nosediving in the 60s.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:35.507]  So, whites are down the rat hole, thanks to social engineering.
[00:45:35.988 --> 00:45:37.790]  Social engineering works on people, folks.
[00:45:38.511 --> 00:45:39.832]  Worked really good on black people.
[00:45:39.852 --> 00:45:44.096]  They had lower illegitimacy until the 50s than white people.
[00:45:45.558 --> 00:45:48.381]  Now it's upwards of 80%, some areas 90 plus percent.
[00:45:49.762 --> 00:45:50.763]  Whites are now pushing 40%.
[00:45:52.739 --> 00:45:53.699]  We're good to go.
[00:46:17.912 --> 00:46:22.534]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip of Chris Matthews trying to whitewash the Jihad attacks.
[00:46:25.796 --> 00:46:26.496]  Good old Chris Hayes.
[00:46:26.597 --> 00:46:33.040]  At least 12 people are dead and dozens injured in Berlin after a truck plowed through evening crowds at a Christmas...
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:34.880]  ...in the German capital.
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:38.502]  According to police, the truck was registered in Poland and may have been stolen.
[00:46:38.962 --> 00:46:41.763]  Police said they arrested a suspect believed to have been the driver.
[00:46:41.803 --> 00:46:46.565]  Investigators have yet to determine whether it was a deliberate attack, much less whether it was terrorism.
[00:46:46.985 --> 00:46:51.527]  But ISIS and Al-Qaeda have both called on followers to use trucks in attacks on public places.
[00:46:51.567 --> 00:46:59.511]  And ISIS claimed responsibility for one such attack over the summer in Nice, France, where a truck barreled through crowds celebrating Bastille Day, killing 86 people.
[00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:02.813]  Trump responded to what happened today in a statement.
[00:47:03.233 --> 00:47:07.216]  Our hearts and prayers are with the loved ones of the victims of today's horrifying terror attack in Berlin.
[00:47:07.776 --> 00:47:11.439]  Innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:18.485]  ISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad.
[00:47:19.245 --> 00:47:25.210]  Just to reiterate, the deadly incident has not been declared a terrorist attack by the German authorities themselves as of yet.
[00:47:26.465 --> 00:47:38.228]  Also today, in the latest example of Syria's violent war spilling past that country's borders, the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by a lone gunman while delivering a speech at a museum in the Turkish capital of Ankara.
[00:47:38.748 --> 00:47:44.969]  Police sources tell NBC News the gunman was Turkish, a 22-year-old officer in the Ankara Special Forces.
[00:47:45.509 --> 00:47:53.991]  According to witnesses, the gunman yelled out, don't forget Aleppo, don't forget Syria, wounding three additional people before being fatally shot by police.
[00:47:55.723 --> 00:47:59.087]  Okay, so there he is trying to cast doubt, but now there's basically no doubt.
[00:47:59.227 --> 00:48:03.751]  Now, let's continue with a New Year's resolution from MTV in a moment.
[00:48:04.092 --> 00:48:10.118]  But first, I want to play London Islamist in front of police chant, Caliphate on its way.
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:15.483]  So, they're telling you, we're coming with our religious system to take over.
[00:48:16.444 --> 00:48:17.545]  They're saying they want
[00:48:18.502 --> 00:48:19.983]  Sharia law to be implemented.
[00:48:20.344 --> 00:48:27.429]  In France, they're telling Muslim women, do not go to French cafes, do not go out without your burqas, or we'll physically come after you.
[00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:28.951]  But it doesn't exist.
[00:48:29.491 --> 00:48:32.313]  The Muslims want to come here and follow our laws and coexist.
[00:48:32.634 --> 00:48:34.135]  Well, some of them do, and they're great people.
[00:48:34.415 --> 00:48:38.799]  They're called heretics, according to Islam.
[00:48:41.206 --> 00:48:43.808]  So, Muslim Shant, USA, you will pay.
[00:48:44.308 --> 00:48:45.569]  Caliphate is on its way.
[00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:48.912]  We also have video of this going on in England as well.
[00:48:50.033 --> 00:48:51.334]  But let's go ahead and go to the one in the US.
[00:48:51.354 --> 00:48:51.714]  Here it is.
[00:48:57.575 --> 00:49:06.101]  They complain, they shout and talk about tears, but they have nothing to bring this situation to light!
[00:49:06.161 --> 00:49:08.683]  Victory, victory on its way!
[00:49:08.743 --> 00:49:12.206]  Yeah, Allah to you we pray!
[00:49:12.886 --> 00:49:15.688]  USA, you will pay!
[00:49:15.768 --> 00:49:18.731]  Say, Lafayette's on its way!
[00:49:21.632 --> 00:49:34.737]  Okay, that is in the UK.
[00:49:34.757 --> 00:49:37.278]  We have the other one here in the US this week as well.
[00:49:37.698 --> 00:49:41.079]  We can put some of those articles up on screen, but I'm not going to play them just because I can't stand to look at it.
[00:49:41.559 --> 00:49:43.300]  And a bunch of arrogant ne'er-do-wells
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.061]  Most of them on welfare.
[00:49:45.161 --> 00:49:46.162]  It's well known they milk it.
[00:49:46.542 --> 00:49:47.803]  Running around, bitching.
[00:49:48.123 --> 00:49:49.604]  And most of these aren't even real immigrants.
[00:49:49.624 --> 00:49:51.385]  They're like former prisoners, criminals.
[00:49:51.765 --> 00:49:57.389]  The colleges and the public schools and the prisons are where this is all being done.
[00:49:57.429 --> 00:49:57.969]  The recruiting.
[00:49:58.449 --> 00:49:59.590]  And the left just loves it.
[00:50:01.892 --> 00:50:04.994]  Now, let me go ahead and go to this next piece that I mentioned.
[00:50:05.014 --> 00:50:06.615]  This is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:07.916 --> 00:50:09.537]  They have pulled this down.
[00:50:10.643 --> 00:50:12.685]  They do not want you to be aware of this.
[00:50:13.405 --> 00:50:25.595]  They've got scores of other videos from the same show on MTV, where they have white men crying, I just showed it on screen earlier, saying, we're sorry, we're racist, all the bad in the world is because of us.
[00:50:25.996 --> 00:50:37.085]  And then all these weird white people, with these other weird, bullying, racist minorities, saying, listen, you're fundamentally bad, do you understand?
[00:50:38.103 --> 00:50:41.225]  And the universities teach, the end of whiteness, how great it's going to be.
[00:50:41.265 --> 00:50:42.366]  We must all look alike.
[00:50:42.386 --> 00:50:46.850]  We must all interbreed into Mongols.
[00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:49.632]  And I'm not against hybrid vigor and people that are mixed.
[00:50:49.712 --> 00:50:50.232]  It's just different.
[00:50:50.493 --> 00:50:53.835]  The point is making us all mix into a Mongol.
[00:50:53.855 --> 00:50:57.858]  When I say Mongol, I mean a Mongol with no culture.
[00:50:58.199 --> 00:50:59.360]  A corporate Mongol.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:03.661]  It's just programmable, that's a consumer that doesn't even know what they're doing.
[00:51:03.921 --> 00:51:10.863]  Again, I'm all for free market, all for wealth, all for power, for people individually directed how they see fit in a free market.
[00:51:11.143 --> 00:51:15.545]  I'm totally against empty consumerism with what the globalists say we must have.
[00:51:16.425 --> 00:51:17.125]  Two different things.
[00:51:17.165 --> 00:51:25.508]  They always claim that I'm contradicting myself because they don't understand nuances or the incredible spectrum of free will.
[00:51:26.448 --> 00:51:28.629]  Now let's go to this truly disgusting
[00:51:29.744 --> 00:51:31.866]  I kept wondering, when will MTV go too far?
[00:51:31.926 --> 00:51:53.167]  Well, when they got 99% downvotes, that's what they got, and when everybody, even the left, freaked out on this, it finally was so much the Stockholm Syndrome, learned helplessness, normalcy bias, white people that hate themselves, their religion is hating themselves, to finally hear being white inherently is bad, period, they finally went, oh my god, this is racism.
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:52:00.985]  Hello white guys, it's about to be a new year and there's a few things we think you could do a little bit better in 2017.
[00:52:02.386 --> 00:52:03.967]  Hit pause, rewind it.
[00:52:03.987 --> 00:52:08.391]  I love how they use soft beta white males and then they cut to a black guy with a cat on his shirt.
[00:52:08.451 --> 00:52:18.260]  It's all non-threatening, I'm wearing pink socks, I've got a cat on, but I'm saying hardcore racist stuff that the KKK would say about black people against white people.
[00:52:19.212 --> 00:52:19.992]  That's their uniform.
[00:52:20.052 --> 00:52:23.093]  It's all trendy, soft, fun, vicious.
[00:52:23.833 --> 00:52:25.193]  We're not going to let you keep any of your money.
[00:52:25.373 --> 00:52:26.094]  We're going to run your life.
[00:52:26.134 --> 00:52:27.434]  We're going to tell you what words to use.
[00:52:27.794 --> 00:52:32.835]  It's a cult using race-based garbage as its operating system.
[00:52:32.855 --> 00:52:33.235]  Here it is.
[00:52:34.236 --> 00:52:35.156]  Hey, fellow white guys.
[00:52:35.316 --> 00:52:36.456]  It's about to be a new year.
[00:52:36.596 --> 00:52:39.097]  And here's a few things we think you could do a little bit better in 2017.
[00:52:41.974 --> 00:52:42.875]  Resolutions for white guys.
[00:52:42.915 --> 00:52:48.499]  First off, try to recognize that America was never great for anyone who wasn't a white guy.
[00:52:48.679 --> 00:52:52.541]  Can we all just agree that Black Lives Matter isn't the opposite of All Lives Matter?
[00:52:52.561 --> 00:52:54.023]  Black lives just matter.
[00:52:54.703 --> 00:52:56.004]  There's no need to overcomplicate it.
[00:52:56.024 --> 00:53:02.048]  Do you notice the arrogance if you're watching and the hatred in these people's eyes?
[00:53:02.088 --> 00:53:11.155]  Their whole cult is that they feel inferior, whether they're a wimpy white guy or whatever, and then they're going around to bully and boss you around in a gang
[00:53:12.088 --> 00:53:15.910]  Of limp-wristed twits that couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag.
[00:53:16.291 --> 00:53:18.732]  And they have no idea about the history here in the United States.
[00:53:19.452 --> 00:53:25.896]  They have no idea about what happened to the North, the South, what the pirate ships were consisted of, where libertarianism began.
[00:53:26.216 --> 00:53:35.122]  They have no idea that the West was this New Atlantis experiment of true liberalism to try to set up a new system to then phase all of that out.
[00:53:35.959 --> 00:53:37.159]  Russian historians know that.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.941]  They claim they're a land-based empire against the whole Atlantean experience.
[00:53:41.361 --> 00:53:44.782]  But you don't even know that true liberalism came out of the West.
[00:53:45.103 --> 00:53:49.724]  You're sitting here saying that Christian liberalism is the worst thing in the world.
[00:53:50.205 --> 00:53:54.726]  But let me tell you, any black folks I know that ever actually go to Africa, they come back going, whoa, I love America now.
[00:53:54.926 --> 00:53:55.867]  Absolutely you do.
[00:53:57.547 --> 00:53:58.728]  Or you go to other places.
[00:53:59.588 --> 00:54:01.209]  I'm telling you, this is crazy.
[00:54:02.076 --> 00:54:04.781]  But again, minorities are the majority now in most areas.
[00:54:05.021 --> 00:54:12.794]  The globalists want to blow up that upwardly mobile, classically liberal stairway to wealth and security and culture.
[00:54:15.579 --> 00:54:16.180]  That's what they're doing.
[00:54:17.731 --> 00:54:18.992]  Because they're bringing in poverty.
[00:54:19.032 --> 00:54:20.872]  They're giving you college degrees that are worthless.
[00:54:20.912 --> 00:54:22.533]  They don't want you to have this birthright.
[00:54:23.233 --> 00:54:30.436]  Fake liberalism is the globalist counterfeit to kill the real Thomas Jeffersonian liberalism they want to destroy.
[00:54:30.636 --> 00:54:42.121]  Then Russia decries the anti-family, anti-human liberalism they see and believe that that's the original liberalism that was here in the United States and Europe when it's not.
[00:54:43.592 --> 00:54:49.595]  So Alexander Duggan and others who are smart people need to actually reassess their analysis if they want to look at that.
[00:54:49.835 --> 00:54:58.059]  I think it's good that Russia is being pro-family, anti-destruction of the family, cutting taxes for the family, pro-freedom, pro-sovereignty.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:59.200]  That's all great.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:00.921]  Pro-male role model.
[00:55:01.721 --> 00:55:02.922]  Because that only empowers the women.
[00:55:03.871 --> 00:55:07.613]  So you don't fall to Islam where it's the mutated extreme of that.
[00:55:08.173 --> 00:55:15.337]  But to insult and attack the entire Western experiment, look at the technology, look at the society, look at the culture.
[00:55:15.537 --> 00:55:23.422]  You don't need to go in some troglodyte direction just because the modern false left has hijacked technology and used it to enslave.
[00:55:23.942 --> 00:55:25.002]  Now that's a message to Russia.
[00:55:25.022 --> 00:55:26.383]  That's not really a message to the general public.
[00:55:26.603 --> 00:55:27.823]  But I'm sure some of the public will get it.
[00:55:28.023 --> 00:55:33.985]  Maybe some of the fake liberals will break out of the control paradigm they're in and vomit out the poison and realize you've been brainwashed.
[00:55:34.185 --> 00:55:34.906]  There's still time.
[00:55:35.166 --> 00:55:35.626]  Let's go back.
[00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:38.387]  Also, Blue Lives Matter isn't a thing.
[00:55:38.647 --> 00:55:40.147]  Cops weren't born with blue skin.
[00:55:41.107 --> 00:55:41.328]  Right?
[00:55:41.348 --> 00:55:42.068]  I mean...
[00:55:44.855 --> 00:55:46.216]  Stop bragging about being woke.
[00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:47.576]  Stop saying woke.
[00:55:47.856 --> 00:55:51.157]  Learn what mansplaining is and then stop doing it.
[00:55:51.777 --> 00:55:56.498]  I love how the media always says men who are white are the only ones that sit with their legs apart.
[00:55:57.518 --> 00:55:59.259]  Giving us new things we've done that are bad.
[00:55:59.319 --> 00:56:00.659]  Women sit with their legs apart.
[00:56:01.639 --> 00:56:04.120]  That's how you sit back and relax.
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:06.961]  Obama does it all the time, but it's okay when he does.
[00:56:07.301 --> 00:56:08.521]  Google Obama mansplaining.
[00:56:09.568 --> 00:56:12.789]  If you do it, it's wrong to sit back on a couch and relax.
[00:56:13.089 --> 00:56:15.529]  Or if there's room on a subway, to sit back and lean back.
[00:56:15.849 --> 00:56:17.730]  You've got to be uptight because you're a man.
[00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:20.050]  But even worse, you're a white man.
[00:56:22.971 --> 00:56:25.371]  Oh, mansplaining, not manspreading.
[00:56:25.791 --> 00:56:29.192]  Oh, exactly, men aren't supposed to talk and be leaders and know things.
[00:56:29.272 --> 00:56:30.652]  Oh yeah, that's even worse.
[00:56:30.832 --> 00:56:32.993]  Only the state is your god.
[00:56:33.253 --> 00:56:33.753]  Right, women?
[00:56:33.953 --> 00:56:34.333]  Here it is.
[00:56:35.529 --> 00:56:39.270]  Don't prioritize the well-being of an Ivy League athlete over the woman he assaulted.
[00:56:39.631 --> 00:56:41.151]  We all love Beyonce.
[00:56:41.471 --> 00:56:42.512]  And yeah, she's black.
[00:56:42.552 --> 00:56:43.072]  That's it, boss.
[00:56:43.572 --> 00:56:44.312]  Backing up to the start.
[00:56:46.053 --> 00:57:02.899]  Notice you've got all these black football players, all these black sports players beating up women, doing all this stuff, but we've got to go find one white swimmer that reportedly date-raped somebody and make it the end of the world because white males are rapists even though they're the lowest demographic group other than some Asian males to rape.
[00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:03.640]  Doesn't matter.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:04.540]  Say they are.
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:10.025]  And then say some white guys rape a black girl in a lacrosse deal when she was a stripper.
[00:57:10.225 --> 00:57:10.986]  Turned out it wasn't true.
[00:57:11.427 --> 00:57:17.092]  But again, this is the media projecting all bull, all weaponized, racist garbage.
[00:57:17.112 --> 00:57:17.413]  Here it is.
[00:57:18.291 --> 00:57:23.175]  Hey fellow white guys, it's about to be a new year, and there's a few things we think you could do a little bit better in 2017.
[00:57:23.215 --> 00:57:24.255]  You know, start it over again.
[00:57:24.275 --> 00:57:25.637]  I'm sorry, we're going to have to break with it.
[00:57:25.717 --> 00:57:26.797]  I'm not going to interrupt this time.
[00:57:27.198 --> 00:57:29.660]  The first white guy's like real wimpy, oh hi, uh.
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:40.428]  And that's, you're a good white guy, you have a chicken neck, and you do what you're told, and you don't exist, and you don't affect change, you're not part of history, you roll over and culturally die, then you're going to be accepted, okay?
[00:57:40.568 --> 00:57:41.068]  Let's play it.
[00:57:41.949 --> 00:57:46.832]  Hey fellow white guys, it's about to be a new year, and there's a few things we think you could do a little bit better in 2017.
[00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:56.197]  First off, try to recognize that America was never great for anyone who wasn't a white guy.
[00:57:56.397 --> 00:58:00.282]  Can we all just agree that Black Lives Matter isn't the opposite of All Lives Matter?
[00:58:00.762 --> 00:58:01.743]  Black lives just matter.
[00:58:02.424 --> 00:58:03.665]  There's no need to overcomplicate it.
[00:58:03.685 --> 00:58:05.628]  Also, you overcomplicated it.
[00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:08.932]  You were the ones that always kept saying, only black lives matter.
[00:58:11.223 --> 00:58:15.186]  And like taking over events saying only black lives matter and going after folks that said all lives matter.
[00:58:15.526 --> 00:58:18.047]  Learn what mansplaining is and then stop doing it.
[00:58:18.367 --> 00:58:23.090]  Oh, and if you're a judge, don't prioritize the well-being of an Ivy League athlete over the woman he assaulted.
[00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:24.951]  We all love Beyonce.
[00:58:25.271 --> 00:58:28.773]  And yeah, she's black, so of course she cares about black issues.
[00:58:29.714 --> 00:58:30.914]  I'm talking to you Fox News.
[00:58:31.355 --> 00:58:32.795]  Feel free to take Kanye West though.
[00:58:33.316 --> 00:58:34.196]  You guys can have him.
[00:58:34.436 --> 00:58:35.437]  You know what you did, Kanye.
[00:58:37.102 --> 00:58:39.663]  Nobody who has black friends says that they have black friends.
[00:58:39.923 --> 00:58:42.564]  And just because you have black friends doesn't mean you're not racist.
[00:58:42.944 --> 00:58:44.244]  You can't be racist with black friends.
[00:58:44.584 --> 00:58:46.565]  Look guys, we know nobody's perfect.
[00:58:46.765 --> 00:58:49.086]  But honestly, we do a little better in 2017.
[00:58:49.406 --> 00:58:51.246]  Some of you guys do a great job.
[00:58:52.107 --> 00:58:52.767]  Some of you don't.
[00:58:52.847 --> 00:58:53.267]  Bullies!
[00:58:53.387 --> 00:58:55.228]  Please, because 2016 is bad.
[00:58:55.248 --> 00:58:56.368]  Please, kiss our ass more.
[00:58:56.388 --> 00:58:57.268]  2016 can't be worse than this.
[00:58:57.488 --> 00:58:58.829]  Please, grovel to us, we're bullies.
[00:59:01.016 --> 00:59:04.839]  As reported by the Daily Mail, yet another Russian diplomat is found dead.
[00:59:04.919 --> 00:59:11.964]  This one at his home in Moscow just hours after the reports came of the assassination of the Russian ambassador in Ankara, Turkey.
[00:59:12.144 --> 00:59:14.045]  Peter Polshakov, 56 years old.
[00:59:14.105 --> 00:59:16.687]  He was found dead from a gunshot wound in his own home.
[00:59:16.807 --> 00:59:21.490]  He's reported to be a senior figure in Russia for the Latin American Department of Foreign Ministry.
[00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:22.430]  And here's what we know.
[00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:28.372]  This high-ranking Russian diplomat, he was found with gunshot wounds to the head, 56 years old, in his own home.
[00:59:28.532 --> 00:59:36.795]  The shooting was disclosed by REN TV, the news breaking shortly after the report coming of the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Ankara, Andrei Karlov.
[00:59:36.835 --> 00:59:43.618]  Now, the circumstances of this shooting remain very unclear, but what we do know is that police are examining all possible motives to his death.
[00:59:43.718 --> 00:59:50.420]  Two empty bullet wounds were found in the apartment in Belotsky Prospekt, and a gun was discovered under the sink in the bathroom.
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:57.584]  As reported by REN TV, your latest update on the second assassination of a Russian diplomat in a spate of 48 hours.
[00:59:57.824 --> 01:00:00.285]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:00:02.066 --> 01:00:06.169]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:00:06.689 --> 01:00:07.970]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.758 --> 01:00:20.759]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.379 --> 01:00:22.260]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.801]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.522 --> 01:00:35.225]  So if you just joined us, I just spent the last 10 minutes or so of the last hour covering a Kit Daniels article.
[01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:40.533]  Up on Infowars.com that needs to go viral because MTV's scared of this.
[01:00:40.573 --> 01:00:41.514]  This went too far.
[01:00:41.534 --> 01:00:45.737]  They've got all these other videos they've done with white men crying and saying, I'm sorry, I'm evil.
[01:00:45.797 --> 01:00:46.698]  Our race is bad.
[01:00:46.758 --> 01:00:47.478]  We're bad people.
[01:00:47.498 --> 01:00:52.602]  I mean, this is like Hitler, but from the MTV perspective against white people.
[01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:57.606]  I mean, it is Nazi ideology against non-whites, but turned around the other way.
[01:00:57.726 --> 01:00:58.507]  It is crazy.
[01:00:59.267 --> 01:01:03.551]  MTV pulls racist resolutions for white guys video amid outrage.
[01:01:05.183 --> 01:01:13.765]  And, again, Kit's going to post some of the older videos they've done on the same show that we've covered where, again, whites apologize for being white.
[01:01:13.785 --> 01:01:15.765]  This is being taught in high schools, colleges, everywhere.
[01:01:16.065 --> 01:01:17.606]  They are stunting your children.
[01:01:17.666 --> 01:01:25.567]  They're turning them into mentally ill, crazy people that hate themselves and turning the minorities into brown KKK members if they can.
[01:01:26.707 --> 01:01:30.968]  While the school tries to teach your five-year-old they're a trainee and should cut their penis off.
[01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:33.709]  So, I mean, this is what's going on in this country, folks.
[01:01:33.769 --> 01:01:34.429]  It's unbelievable.
[01:01:35.495 --> 01:01:41.236]  So we're going to, again, add those other articles to the story that's up on Infowars.com that needs to go viral.
[01:01:41.296 --> 01:01:47.337]  Now, as if that isn't bad enough, we have Michelle Obama running around.
[01:01:47.357 --> 01:01:50.838]  And by the way, she looks like a snapping turtle.
[01:01:51.538 --> 01:01:54.739]  I don't say she looks like a snapping turtle because she's black and I dislike black people.
[01:01:54.779 --> 01:01:56.399]  I know a lot of really good-looking black ladies.
[01:01:56.899 --> 01:02:00.340]  It's because she looks like a hateful snapping turtle who's a man.
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.140]  She looks like a tranny.
[01:02:03.513 --> 01:02:07.435]  And of course I say that so the media attacks me, because everybody hates the media and they just come to us with media attacks.
[01:02:08.075 --> 01:02:10.817]  And the media hadn't figured out how much they're hated, so they keep taking the bait.
[01:02:10.837 --> 01:02:14.219]  But, sorry, video Michelle Obama compares Americans to toddlers.
[01:02:15.039 --> 01:02:20.142]  Now I compare myself to an albino gorilla, so it's okay to insult people, and if you can turn around and say it about yourself.
[01:02:20.822 --> 01:02:23.043]  But getting serious, that's what my kids call me.
[01:02:23.063 --> 01:02:24.604]  They go, you look like a gorilla, Daddy.
[01:02:24.924 --> 01:02:26.145]  You're hairy like one, Daddy.
[01:02:28.135 --> 01:02:29.577]  I do kind of have a chest like a gorilla.
[01:02:30.018 --> 01:02:33.322]  In fact, the guys this morning, we were out exercising and they were calling me a gorilla.
[01:02:34.703 --> 01:02:35.224]  So, anyways.
[01:02:35.925 --> 01:02:44.095]  Continuing, that was Q and Pat and my son was out with us this morning exercising and hiking and it was all big, big funny about how I look like a gorilla.
[01:02:44.535 --> 01:02:45.917]  Better than a snapping turtle!
[01:02:46.687 --> 01:02:48.989]  Now continuing, U.S.
[01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:54.214]  confidence surges to the highest level that Gallup has ever recorded on Trump-phobia, but that's okay.
[01:02:54.434 --> 01:02:55.335]  He's a bad person.
[01:02:55.535 --> 01:02:56.496]  He doesn't know what he's doing.
[01:02:56.897 --> 01:02:59.159]  Michelle Obama and Michael Moore, they know everything.
[01:02:59.499 --> 01:03:04.364]  Meanwhile, she compares people that voted, the American people for Trump, as toddlers that hit their head.
[01:03:04.724 --> 01:03:06.406]  She's the mommy, we're the idiots.
[01:03:06.746 --> 01:03:08.227]  Here she is with Oprah Winfrey.
[01:03:08.428 --> 01:03:09.849]  Let's analyze this propaganda.
[01:03:13.067 --> 01:03:17.128]  Your husband's administration, everything, the election, was all about hope.
[01:03:17.148 --> 01:03:20.269]  Do you think that this administration achieved that?
[01:03:21.389 --> 01:03:21.729]  Yes.
[01:03:23.749 --> 01:03:24.049]  I do.
[01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:27.450]  Because we feel the difference now.
[01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:28.530]  Racial division?
[01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:31.951]  Now we're feeling what not having hope feels like.
[01:03:32.151 --> 01:03:32.951]  Oh, the exuberance?
[01:03:32.971 --> 01:03:33.311]  You know?
[01:03:34.672 --> 01:03:35.812]  Hope is necessary.
[01:03:36.852 --> 01:03:40.013]  It's a necessary concept.
[01:03:41.323 --> 01:03:47.372]  And Barack didn't just talk about hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes.
[01:03:48.213 --> 01:03:53.881]  I mean, he and I and so many believe that if you, what else do you have if you don't have hope?
[01:03:53.921 --> 01:03:54.142]  Yeah.
[01:03:54.422 --> 01:03:57.286]  What do you give your kids if you can't give them hope?
[01:03:58.103 --> 01:04:03.245]  You know, our children respond to crises the way they see us respond.
[01:04:03.746 --> 01:04:09.688]  You know, it's like the toddler that bumps his head on the table and they look up at you to figure out whether it hurts.
[01:04:09.768 --> 01:04:11.909]  And if you're like, oh my God, they're crying.
[01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:13.890]  But if you're like, you know what, babe, it's OK.
[01:04:14.231 --> 01:04:14.451]  It's OK.
[01:04:15.371 --> 01:04:17.314]  And I feel that way about the nation.
[01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:24.564]  I feel that Barack has been that for the nation in ways that people will come to appreciate.
[01:04:24.985 --> 01:04:25.365]  That's enough.
[01:04:32.213 --> 01:04:33.294]  She's talking about her constituents.
[01:04:33.314 --> 01:04:35.937]  She's not talking about the people that she thinks are idiots that voted for Trump.
[01:04:36.438 --> 01:04:40.382]  She's saying her constituents are like toddlers that have hit their head.
[01:04:40.963 --> 01:04:42.104]  That's about what they're like, actually.
[01:04:42.344 --> 01:04:45.528]  And they look up to her and she goes, that's OK, baby.
[01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:47.190]  It's going to be all right.
[01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:49.532]  I mean, the arrogance, the elitism.
[01:04:50.714 --> 01:04:53.256]  These are the folks that go to Africa and tell people they can't have
[01:04:54.147 --> 01:04:59.190]  Cars are air conditioning as he walks off Air Force One with 10 planes behind him and thousands of people.
[01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:04.213]  And carbon footprints bigger than anything you can imagine and 50 million a day being spent.
[01:05:04.633 --> 01:05:07.615]  But you can't have a house or a car or an air conditioner.
[01:05:10.475 --> 01:05:14.879]  Paul Krugman wants you to know that he is smarter than you.
[01:05:15.139 --> 01:05:21.744]  He's an American economist, distinguished professor of economics, and writer for the New York Times.
[01:05:22.145 --> 01:05:29.771]  Yesterday, Krugman posted a short article on his Twitter account, warning America about what he calls Trumponomics.
[01:05:30.112 --> 01:05:38.839]  He says to join the Trump administration, you have to be a white nationalist and, here comes the C word, a conspiracy theorist.
[01:05:39.319 --> 01:05:47.363]  Most of us living outside the Matrix know better than to take Krugman seriously because he's been wrong so many times in the past.
[01:05:47.603 --> 01:05:55.027]  It was Paul Krugman himself who predicted back in 1998 the drastically slow growth of the Internet.
[01:05:55.247 --> 01:05:56.347]  And I'm gonna quote him here.
[01:05:56.568 --> 01:06:04.211]  By 2005, it will be clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine.
[01:06:04.511 --> 01:06:08.952]  You can learn more about Paul Krugman's liberal logic right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:10.436 --> 01:06:18.560]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:28.364]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption, and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[01:06:28.745 --> 01:06:32.646]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[01:06:32.707 --> 01:06:35.688]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[01:06:35.708 --> 01:06:37.209]  We now have George Soros.
[01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:39.050]  As a goblin.
[01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:43.393]  On the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters.
[01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:44.393]  No Soros.
[01:06:44.753 --> 01:06:45.514]  Him as a goblin.
[01:06:46.254 --> 01:06:50.617]  It says, Deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[01:06:52.879 --> 01:06:56.081]  So, it is a limited edition, Deport Soros on the back.
[01:06:56.601 --> 01:06:57.762]  Hillary for President on the front.
[01:06:58.162 --> 01:06:59.963]  Right hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[01:07:00.304 --> 01:07:00.884]  It's powerful.
[01:07:00.904 --> 01:07:01.945]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.
[01:07:02.225 --> 01:07:03.986]  InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:15.722]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words, and his was action.
[01:07:16.302 --> 01:07:17.823]  His was what he's done to women.
[01:07:17.863 --> 01:07:23.545]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[01:07:23.765 --> 01:07:26.086]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[01:07:26.427 --> 01:07:32.629]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:38.052]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[01:07:48.888 --> 01:07:51.630]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[01:07:52.491 --> 01:07:53.932]  It's a fight for our minds.
[01:07:54.613 --> 01:07:56.554]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[01:07:56.874 --> 01:08:01.078]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:08:01.218 --> 01:08:04.561]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[01:08:04.641 --> 01:08:06.242]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:08:06.462 --> 01:08:07.103]  Take action!
[01:08:14.148 --> 01:08:14.769]  The answer.
[01:08:17.657 --> 01:08:19.258]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:08:19.598 --> 01:08:25.921]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:27.361 --> 01:08:30.743]  So Michelle Obama comes out with Oprah Winfrey and insults her.
[01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:32.731]  Supporters.
[01:08:33.311 --> 01:08:35.233]  We played the full clip in context earlier.
[01:08:35.273 --> 01:08:37.035]  I'm gonna play it again in a moment, just the short part.
[01:08:37.836 --> 01:08:44.322]  Where she says, you know, I see the nation as toddlers that hit their head on a table and they look up at mommy and you just gotta tell them everything's alright.
[01:08:44.902 --> 01:08:46.224]  We're gonna bleed you dry.
[01:08:46.404 --> 01:08:47.705]  She didn't actually say what she was thinking.
[01:08:48.346 --> 01:08:50.047]  But she says we're gonna, you know, take care of you.
[01:08:50.388 --> 01:08:53.611]  That's how she sees her constituents as a bunch of toddlers.
[01:08:54.619 --> 01:08:57.362]  And I gotta say, we've gone out and seen their constituents.
[01:08:57.402 --> 01:09:02.528]  They do look like a bunch of toddlers who've been through shock therapy and then a lobotomy with an ice pick.
[01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:07.014]  And then the rest of them are a bunch of parasites feeding on the lobotomized toddlers.
[01:09:07.614 --> 01:09:11.198]  So it's a very, very sad situation indeed.
[01:09:11.679 --> 01:09:13.381]  We have Chris Hayes we covered last hour.
[01:09:13.401 --> 01:09:14.302]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:09:15.782 --> 01:09:27.504]  Trying to cover up right now the fact that it's Islamic terror that killed the ambassador in Turkey and ran over the people at the Christmas festival there in Berlin.
[01:09:29.264 --> 01:09:30.945]  Whatever happened to Berlin?
[01:09:33.325 --> 01:09:35.205]  Well, I guess it's been brainwashed.
[01:09:35.245 --> 01:09:39.266]  That's what's going on there in Berlin.
[01:09:40.666 --> 01:09:43.567]  And of course, you should add in the state of Berlin, it has its own state.
[01:09:46.075 --> 01:09:49.517]  Secretary of State, it calls for Sharia law just last week.
[01:09:50.357 --> 01:09:50.917]  She's a woman.
[01:09:51.158 --> 01:09:54.319]  She doesn't wear a burqa in public, but she wants you to have to wear one.
[01:09:54.879 --> 01:10:05.084]  And Muslim men have announced in France that if they see women out without burqas or in French cafes, they're going to have Sharia law caning carried out against them.
[01:10:06.645 --> 01:10:09.387]  And the Stockholm Syndrome women, most of them, they love it.
[01:10:09.907 --> 01:10:13.969]  They just want to make sure your daughter, your mother, has to put on a burqa as well.
[01:10:16.004 --> 01:10:17.025]  So that's all coming up.
[01:10:17.946 --> 01:10:20.307]  We also have several guests joining us today.
[01:10:21.188 --> 01:10:25.411]  Last hour I played the video that they have removed because they don't want you to see it.
[01:10:25.992 --> 01:10:30.615]  MTV pulls racist resolution for white guys video amid outrage.
[01:10:31.476 --> 01:10:33.818]  Quite frankly, this isn't even as bad as some of the videos
[01:10:35.077 --> 01:10:42.559]  We had articles on last year, in fact we should pull some of those videos again and download them and play them, where they have white men going, I'm sorry, I call the Lord, whites are evil.
[01:10:42.579 --> 01:10:46.500]  They're like, that's right, whites are inherently bad, learn to say it, learn to say it.
[01:10:47.121 --> 01:10:55.383]  The only good whites though are the ones that say whites are inherently bad and then they can yell, you're an effing white male at another white male, your opinion doesn't matter.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.641]  So, this is what they're pushing.
[01:11:01.882 --> 01:11:03.823]  We're going to be looking at that in great detail.
[01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:07.186]  We've got a lot of really exciting economic news I want to get to first.
[01:11:08.887 --> 01:11:13.051]  And Paul Krugman has really gone to the next level.
[01:11:14.072 --> 01:11:19.116]  But first, before I do that, let's play the clip, again, that's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:11:19.136 --> 01:11:21.718]  Michelle Obama compares Americans to toddlers.
[01:11:22.158 --> 01:11:28.744]  Her constituents particularly, they've hit their head, they're looking up at mommy, and she'll make it all okay.
[01:11:30.863 --> 01:11:35.229]  Our children respond to crises the way they see us respond.
[01:11:35.749 --> 01:11:41.678]  You know, it's like the toddler that bumps his head on the table and they look up at you to figure out whether it hurts.
[01:11:41.758 --> 01:11:43.921]  And if you're like, oh my God, they're crying.
[01:11:44.021 --> 01:11:45.883]  But if you're like, you know what, babe, it's okay.
[01:11:46.204 --> 01:11:46.584]  It's okay.
[01:11:47.365 --> 01:11:49.286]  And I feel that way about the nation.
[01:11:49.326 --> 01:11:56.529]  I feel that Barack has been that for the nation in ways that people will come to appreciate.
[01:11:57.549 --> 01:12:03.252]  Having a grown up in the White House who can say to you in times of crisis and turmoil,
[01:12:03.912 --> 01:12:05.333]  Hey, it's gonna be okay.
[01:12:06.013 --> 01:12:08.414]  Let's remember the good things that we have.
[01:12:08.454 --> 01:12:09.475]  Let's look at the future.
[01:12:09.515 --> 01:12:11.455]  Let's look at all the things that we're building.
[01:12:11.856 --> 01:12:20.379]  All of this is important for our kids to stay focused and to feel like their work isn't in vain.
[01:12:20.399 --> 01:12:22.280]  What do we do if we don't have hope, Oprah?
[01:12:24.241 --> 01:12:34.170]  So just to not see our families have been broken up, to not see how you've been put in prison, in jail by the Democrats, pledging to put, quote, the predators in jail, take them to heel, domesticate you, which they did in the 60s.
[01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:36.132]  Just stay on the plantation.
[01:12:36.472 --> 01:12:37.954]  She'll take good care of you toddlers.
[01:12:38.334 --> 01:12:39.275]  Well, I don't want to be a toddler.
[01:12:39.295 --> 01:12:39.855]  What about you?
[01:12:40.636 --> 01:12:41.277]  I want to be a man.
[01:12:42.938 --> 01:12:43.699]  Women want to be women.
[01:12:43.719 --> 01:12:44.319]  We want to be free.
[01:12:45.216 --> 01:13:04.887]  Now before I get to Paul Krugman blowing both of his proverbial political feet off again with incredible statements and what's really happening in the economy to his chagrin, before I do that, I want to air a piece that will certainly trigger folks.
[01:13:04.927 --> 01:13:08.249]  First for TV viewers, let's put it on screen in front of me and then behind me.
[01:13:09.129 --> 01:13:11.411]  Paul Watson tweeted today, the ultimate triggering.
[01:13:12.253 --> 01:13:13.094]  Merry Christmas!
[01:13:13.914 --> 01:13:19.438]  Doesn't Christmas feel a little more special this year?
[01:13:20.419 --> 01:13:31.327]  Making Christmas great again, and for radio listeners, it's got the baby Jesus, it's got the American flag, President of the United States, it's got Trump all happy presiding over it all, with Santy Claus back there as well.
[01:13:32.987 --> 01:13:35.869]  And little presents under the tree and snow falling.
[01:13:36.289 --> 01:13:37.249]  It's so nice.
[01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:38.770]  Winter Festival.
[01:13:39.471 --> 01:13:40.351]  Don't say Christmas.
[01:13:40.451 --> 01:13:41.532]  Don't even say holiday now.
[01:13:42.052 --> 01:13:43.093]  Let the triggering begin.
[01:13:44.892 --> 01:13:53.079]  Well, it was Gingrich a few weeks ago likened Trump to the grizzly bear in The Revenant, tearing Leonardo DiCaprio apart.
[01:13:53.099 --> 01:13:57.123]  As much as I can't stand Leonardo DiCaprio and his politics, I like him as an actor.
[01:13:57.203 --> 01:13:58.164]  Great, great movie.
[01:13:58.584 --> 01:13:59.345]  Very historical.
[01:13:59.826 --> 01:14:00.486]  Just stop gushing.
[01:14:00.927 --> 01:14:03.689]  The Mexican director, I think is the best, I forget his name, best director out there.
[01:14:03.849 --> 01:14:04.710]  They call that racism.
[01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:06.632]  I just say he's a Mexican director, like the Russian director.
[01:14:06.912 --> 01:14:08.354]  I said the word Mexican, I'm racist, I'm racist.
[01:14:08.454 --> 01:14:09.595]  I think he's the best director out there.
[01:14:09.615 --> 01:14:10.336]  Racist, racist, racist.
[01:14:10.496 --> 01:14:11.578]  We're admiring someone, see?
[01:14:11.778 --> 01:14:12.479]  See the mind control?
[01:14:12.499 --> 01:14:21.409]  Just totally putting us into a catatonic, basket case, learned helplessness, mind control system where we don't communicate with each other because we want to be correct and nothing's correct.
[01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:22.230]  Everything's bad.
[01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:25.314]  Only, only, only CNN can tell us about WikiLeaks.
[01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:31.394]  So I'm going to retweet during the break at Real Alex Jones, doesn't Christmas feel more special this year?
[01:14:31.794 --> 01:14:34.137]  We're going to retweet that out to everyone.
[01:14:34.177 --> 01:14:39.023]  And I want to encourage my Graphics folks to also put out some politically incorrect stuff as well.
[01:14:39.083 --> 01:14:40.845]  Maybe even a little baby Jesus on it.
[01:14:41.585 --> 01:14:44.549]  I love a little baby Jesus to quote Talladega Nights.
[01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:47.052]  But before we do that,
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:57.724]  Let's go ahead and play the Revenant piece here, where someone took the point of what Gingrich was talking about and put it to the big screen.
[01:14:58.844 --> 01:15:02.166]  Donald Trump is the grizzly bear in the Revenant.
[01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:10.932]  First of all, Rand Paul shouldn't even be on this stage.
[01:15:11.153 --> 01:15:13.695]  Jeff Bush is a low energy person.
[01:15:13.815 --> 01:15:15.577]  Barson is lower energy than Bush!
[01:15:15.657 --> 01:15:16.518]  I don't get it!
[01:15:16.578 --> 01:15:18.960]  If you're a child molester, there's no cure.
[01:15:19.101 --> 01:15:23.905]  I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there.
[01:15:24.146 --> 01:15:25.967]  I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.
[01:15:26.007 --> 01:15:27.689]  He's a war hero because he was captured.
[01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:30.011]  I like people that weren't captured, okay?
[01:15:30.071 --> 01:15:31.133]  I have never seen
[01:15:32.133 --> 01:15:35.315]  A human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
[01:15:35.555 --> 01:15:37.456]  They're losers, they're babies.
[01:15:37.476 --> 01:15:38.677]  It's Rubio!
[01:15:39.477 --> 01:15:40.938]  Little Marco, Little Marco.
[01:15:40.978 --> 01:15:44.300]  That Little Marco, he's not cool, he sweats too much.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.742]  And then of course, we have Crooked Hillary, Crooked Hillary.
[01:15:49.062 --> 01:15:51.143]  She's been crooked from the beginning.
[01:15:51.544 --> 01:15:53.825]  As I say, Crooked Hillary, Crooked Hillary.
[01:15:54.085 --> 01:15:55.646]  She's as crooked as they come.
[01:15:57.888 --> 01:15:59.069]  Such a nasty one.
[01:15:59.089 --> 01:16:02.433]  Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[01:16:03.073 --> 01:16:04.074]  Because you'd be in jail.
[01:16:04.154 --> 01:16:05.436]  Do we like the media?
[01:16:07.718 --> 01:16:08.859]  Do we hate the media?
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.061]  They are terrible.
[01:16:11.321 --> 01:16:12.262]  They are the worst.
[01:16:12.462 --> 01:16:15.404]  Sleazy guy right over here from ABC.
[01:16:15.424 --> 01:16:17.766]  Uh, blood coming out of her wherever.
[01:16:17.786 --> 01:16:19.768]  Whoever even heard of her before the last debate.
[01:16:19.948 --> 01:16:20.568]  Katie Turk!
[01:16:20.948 --> 01:16:21.809]  Little Katie.
[01:16:21.829 --> 01:16:23.991]  The world's most dishonest people are back there.
[01:16:24.031 --> 01:16:24.811]  Sit down.
[01:16:24.952 --> 01:16:26.132]  Go back to Univision.
[01:16:26.172 --> 01:16:27.213]  CNN is terrible.
[01:16:27.694 --> 01:16:28.594]  Lion Ted.
[01:16:28.915 --> 01:16:29.655]  Lion Ted.
[01:16:29.735 --> 01:16:30.636]  Lion Ted.
[01:16:30.936 --> 01:16:31.677]  Lion Ted.
[01:16:31.697 --> 01:16:36.160]  You know, Lion Ted talking about New York values with scorn in his face.
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.521]  We have Lion Ted Cruz.
[01:16:37.601 --> 01:16:38.062]  I'm lying.
[01:16:38.802 --> 01:16:39.423]  You're a liar.
[01:16:39.663 --> 01:16:40.544]  Bible high.
[01:16:41.084 --> 01:16:41.924]  Bible high.
[01:16:42.585 --> 01:16:44.506]  Puts it down and then he lies.
[01:16:44.927 --> 01:16:45.967]  She said he's a pussy.
[01:16:46.007 --> 01:16:46.528]  That's correct.
[01:16:47.168 --> 01:16:50.611]  It's L-Y-I-N apostrophe.
[01:16:50.971 --> 01:16:51.811]  Lion Ted.
[01:16:51.852 --> 01:16:53.232]  You know, I call him Lion Ted.
[01:16:53.253 --> 01:16:53.753]  I've heard that.
[01:16:53.773 --> 01:16:56.135]  Puts goofy friend named Elizabeth Warren.
[01:16:56.295 --> 01:16:57.235]  She is a goofus.
[01:16:57.435 --> 01:16:58.436]  She's a basket case.
[01:16:58.456 --> 01:17:00.157]  Goofy Elizabeth Warren.
[01:17:00.177 --> 01:17:00.858]  Pocahontas.
[01:17:01.879 --> 01:17:03.260]  Pocahontas?
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.680]  Very offensive!
[01:17:04.821 --> 01:17:06.982]  Oh, I'm sorry about that.
[01:17:07.442 --> 01:17:08.063]  Pocahontas?
[01:17:08.163 --> 01:17:09.604]  Bernie Sanders is speaking!
[01:17:10.184 --> 01:17:13.186]  And these two young women came up and they took over the microphone!
[01:17:13.226 --> 01:17:13.787]  Microphone?
[01:17:13.807 --> 01:17:15.227]  They just took the whole place over!
[01:17:15.468 --> 01:17:16.668]  And he walked away!
[01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:19.230]  He looked so weak!
[01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:20.491]  And so pathetic!
[01:17:20.751 --> 01:17:23.233]  But Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[01:17:24.013 --> 01:17:25.714]  She gained a massive amount of weight.
[01:17:26.135 --> 01:17:30.378]  Pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.
[01:17:31.418 --> 01:17:47.772]  Your Twitter account only Rosie O'Donnell and your mother is voting for Trump By the way, I mean they call us racist and terrorist and homophobes and just every other name in the book and Then we respond back.
[01:17:47.833 --> 01:17:48.393]  We're bad.
[01:17:48.453 --> 01:17:51.256]  We're mean By the way, they've been reminding me.
[01:17:51.316 --> 01:17:53.918]  I didn't plug once in the last hour and I even skipped a break.
[01:17:53.938 --> 01:17:53.958]  I
[01:17:55.250 --> 01:18:00.413]  That's why I want to thank all the listeners for supporting us when I do talk about the specials and the products that we have.
[01:18:01.394 --> 01:18:08.478]  By the way, we've done such a good job this year of not over-ordering product that we're not going to have basically anything left when the New Year hits for a few weeks.
[01:18:08.678 --> 01:18:14.842]  Most of our nutraceuticals are going to be sold out, which is a good thing and a bad thing, but that's how we fund our operations.
[01:18:14.862 --> 01:18:17.044]  But I've been trying to budget things and be a little bit tighter here.
[01:18:17.964 --> 01:18:21.865]  So I can save money to hire more crew and also pay our people better because they really deserve it.
[01:18:21.885 --> 01:18:32.547]  I want to thank you all for your support, but you're getting great supplements, great products, great non-GMO seeds, great water filtration systems, you know, great apparel to spread the word and fight the globalists and the info war.
[01:18:32.947 --> 01:18:36.828]  But our 2016 Christmas Super Sale specials are quickly selling out.
[01:18:37.228 --> 01:18:41.089]  So you can't get stuff delivered before Christmas in most areas of the United States now.
[01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:41.969]  It's just not going to happen.
[01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:43.089]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:45.091]  You need to stock up on colloidal silver.
[01:18:45.131 --> 01:18:46.472]  Still 50% off Silver Bullet.
[01:18:47.012 --> 01:18:50.195]  Still 33% off on Rainforest.
[01:18:50.235 --> 01:18:52.096]  Now 20% more on each bottle on top of that.
[01:18:52.476 --> 01:18:54.598]  Sign up for auto-ship, an additional 10% off.
[01:18:55.018 --> 01:18:56.820]  There's so many specials I can't go over them all.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.181]  Winter Sun, 25% off.
[01:18:59.482 --> 01:19:00.442]  DNA Forest, 25% off.
[01:19:00.462 --> 01:19:01.403]  Well, that's sold out.
[01:19:01.783 --> 01:19:03.264]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[01:19:03.305 --> 01:19:04.185]  That's about to sell out.
[01:19:04.886 --> 01:19:06.427]  Bio-Truth Selenium, about to sell out.
[01:19:08.575 --> 01:19:15.360]  I'm going to be in here in the next few weeks pitching t-shirts and water filters and stuff, which you really need, obviously, but not the nutraceuticals, because they're going to be sold out.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:20.164]  So please help us at the year-end sale blow all this out, so we don't have to pay tax on it.
[01:19:20.524 --> 01:19:23.326]  Plus, you can stock up on high-quality products you're going to be using.
[01:19:23.766 --> 01:19:26.789]  Again, selenium, key to electrochemical activity in the body.
[01:19:27.609 --> 01:19:28.770]  Go read the study for yourself.
[01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:29.631]  It is incredible.
[01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:32.613]  Same thing for the true nascent iodine that we have.
[01:19:32.653 --> 01:19:33.954]  Quite frankly, nobody else has it.
[01:19:34.554 --> 01:19:35.535]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:19:36.816 --> 01:19:39.059]  Superblue is $9.95.
[01:19:39.499 --> 01:19:40.520]  We're about to sell out of that.
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:42.542]  It has colloidal silver and iodine.
[01:19:42.843 --> 01:19:45.285]  You can pay $14.95 so we can fund the operation.
[01:19:45.305 --> 01:19:46.226]  It's a new thing I'm doing.
[01:19:46.246 --> 01:19:49.330]  You can pay full retail or discount, depending on what you want to do.
[01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:51.071]  And folks are taking advantage of that.
[01:19:51.091 --> 01:19:54.055]  A lot of folks are paying for it full retail to help us fund the operation.
[01:19:54.075 --> 01:19:54.935]  So thank you for the support.
[01:19:55.216 --> 01:19:55.816]  God bless you.
[01:19:56.357 --> 01:20:02.299]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for President of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again!
[01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:29.453]  They see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump.
[01:20:30.595 --> 01:20:32.396]  The career politicians hate Trump.
[01:20:32.817 --> 01:20:37.381]  It's just awfully good that Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[01:20:39.223 --> 01:20:40.144]  Because you'd be in jail.
[01:20:41.241 --> 01:20:46.923]  Trump's election is going to be the biggest f*** you ever recorded in human history.
[01:20:47.283 --> 01:20:49.804]  Do you think your business background helps you with campaigning?
[01:20:49.824 --> 01:20:51.364]  I was doing the primaries.
[01:20:51.924 --> 01:20:54.905]  I spent less money than other people and I did better.
[01:20:55.526 --> 01:20:56.906]  And that's what we want to do for the country.
[01:20:56.926 --> 01:20:58.947]  We want to spend less money and do better.
[01:21:00.107 --> 01:21:07.109]  I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.
[01:21:07.309 --> 01:21:08.770]  Hi, this is Ted Cruz calling.
[01:21:19.605 --> 01:21:24.830]  Death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.
[01:21:25.391 --> 01:21:28.313]  This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton.
[01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:32.638]  Now the two faces of Hillary Clinton are coming out.
[01:21:32.658 --> 01:21:38.984]  The fact, through WikiLeaks, that she says one thing and- Oh no.
[01:21:39.124 --> 01:21:41.226]  All right, let's see if we can get Congressman Collins back.
[01:21:41.286 --> 01:21:43.048]  Obviously, we just lost the satellite feed.
[01:21:46.009 --> 01:21:47.413]  I think the media is very dishonest.
[01:21:47.453 --> 01:21:48.336]  I say it all the time.
[01:21:48.476 --> 01:21:51.886]  I think they're among the most dishonest human beings I've ever met.
[01:22:07.228 --> 01:22:21.691]  Remember, Hillary Clinton has some vulnerabilities herself because of her support in the 1990s for anti-crime legislation that ultimately helped contribute to this era of mass incarceration that she now speaks out again.
[01:22:21.711 --> 01:22:24.312]  We just lost Brianna Keillor.
[01:22:24.332 --> 01:22:27.153]  I'm not a super predator, Hillary Clinton.
[01:22:27.493 --> 01:22:29.093]  We'll talk about it.
[01:22:29.133 --> 01:22:32.014]  We apologize to black people for mass incarceration.
[01:22:34.421 --> 01:22:35.462]  I will be the nominee.
[01:22:35.522 --> 01:22:37.562]  There is no way that I won't be.
[01:22:38.483 --> 01:22:47.186]  Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections?
[01:22:47.727 --> 01:22:48.967]  Is that democracy?
[01:22:48.987 --> 01:23:00.152]  All of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out of the vote by a rigged system, we welcome you with open arms.
[01:23:05.686 --> 01:23:07.508]  History is watching us now.
[01:23:08.248 --> 01:23:11.611]  It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion.
[01:23:11.951 --> 01:23:12.832]  Just win, baby.
[01:23:13.112 --> 01:23:20.018]  And if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.
[01:23:21.119 --> 01:23:21.919]  I am with you.
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:24.261]  I will fight for you.
[01:23:25.102 --> 01:23:26.863]  And I will win for you.
[01:23:29.785 --> 01:23:31.087]  I am your voice.
[01:23:40.535 --> 01:23:43.196]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see I told you so.
[01:23:43.436 --> 01:23:46.477]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[01:23:46.837 --> 01:23:47.577]  Because it's already here.
[01:23:47.957 --> 01:23:48.618]  It's being announced.
[01:23:48.978 --> 01:23:52.439]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[01:23:52.879 --> 01:23:54.839]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:23:54.919 --> 01:23:56.480]  A new battleship in the fight.
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:57.680]  InfoWars Live.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:58.681]  Available right now.
[01:23:58.941 --> 01:24:00.301]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[01:24:00.741 --> 01:24:03.142]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[01:24:03.842 --> 01:24:04.742]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[01:24:05.303 --> 01:24:08.304]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[01:24:08.804 --> 01:24:09.384]  Take action!
[01:24:20.294 --> 01:24:22.736]  Coming up in the next segment, when I have time, report!
[01:24:23.136 --> 01:24:27.059]  Obama threatened Putin with war over election hacking conspiracy theory.
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:32.103]  President used emergency red phone system to say armed conflict could ensue.
[01:24:33.204 --> 01:24:35.846]  Yeah, that's the word out of ambassadors and others.
[01:24:35.947 --> 01:24:36.327]  Hillary!
[01:24:39.361 --> 01:24:51.796]  Obviously has talked about the fact that we needed the policy a year ago, which is now the policy of NATO and the U.S., and they claim there's an attack via cyber attack from the continent of Eurasia, basically, or anywhere in Russian territory.
[01:24:53.832 --> 01:24:56.495]  That they are then going to launch a military attack on Russia.
[01:24:56.835 --> 01:25:00.419]  You cannot make this level of crap up.
[01:25:00.519 --> 01:25:05.003]  In fact, in the next segment, will you guys also just pull up the articles about new U.S.
[01:25:05.043 --> 01:25:07.946]  policy to cyber attack includes military attack on Russia?
[01:25:07.966 --> 01:25:11.569]  I want to show that to people because, believe me, it doesn't sound real.
[01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:12.030]  I get it.
[01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.831]  It sounds like a lie.
[01:25:14.036 --> 01:25:22.601]  Just like, oh, I've got like 15 or more different MTV videos that actually say whites are inherently bad, the world will be good when they're all gone.
[01:25:23.282 --> 01:25:27.985]  We're just people that have less skin pigment from Northern Europe.
[01:25:29.986 --> 01:25:31.127]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:25:32.687 --> 01:25:34.969]  And technically, I'm a Mongol because I'm part Native American.
[01:25:35.389 --> 01:25:36.950]  But the whole point is, so what?
[01:25:38.351 --> 01:25:40.072]  This is all craziness, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:41.813 --> 01:25:42.594]  This is craziness.
[01:25:43.761 --> 01:25:52.304]  But they're the ones pushing it because they co-opted the whole Libertarian Republican movement to end segregation and all of it in the 60s.
[01:25:52.824 --> 01:25:54.264]  The party of the KKK did.
[01:25:55.945 --> 01:25:57.645]  But let's get to this big news right now.
[01:25:59.126 --> 01:26:03.767]  Paul Krugman, who is wrong almost all the time because he's disinfo-operative,
[01:26:05.788 --> 01:26:15.395]  I haven't decided if he is like a total idiot with like a 75 IQ or if it's like some type of like secret comedy he's involved in because the U.S.
[01:26:15.435 --> 01:26:20.239]  economy conference announcement, the U.S.
[01:26:20.279 --> 01:26:25.843]  economy when it comes to confidence surges to the highest level that Gallup has ever recorded.
[01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:26.884]  Gallup's U.S.
[01:26:26.924 --> 01:26:30.347]  Economic Confidence Index has never been higher than it is today, ever.
[01:26:30.587 --> 01:26:32.248]  They're calling it Trump euphoria.
[01:26:33.209 --> 01:26:35.211]  Now, how does Krugman respond to this?
[01:26:36.411 --> 01:26:44.719]  Krugman comes out in the New York Times and says, to join Trump administration, you have to be a white nationalist and a conspiracy theorist.
[01:26:44.739 --> 01:26:48.022]  So, question known liars and be white, which isn't even true.
[01:26:49.113 --> 01:27:11.050]  He goes on to attack the economics that Trump is talking about, trying to have infrastructure spending increased with tax incentives to states, counties, and cities and individuals for infrastructure and for federal funding of infrastructure when our infrastructure is falling apart, despite the fact Krugman has called for this before, because that's just basic Keynesian economics.
[01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:16.294]  So he's now going back on what he claims he's an economic follower of, but forget that.
[01:27:16.934 --> 01:27:20.875]  Guess what he said in the New York Times in 1998.
[01:27:22.115 --> 01:27:24.136]  You cannot make this up.
[01:27:24.176 --> 01:27:30.778]  This is when Dinosaur Media was telling itself, don't worry, in an article about the Internet, we're still going to be dominant.
[01:27:30.798 --> 01:27:34.739]  Remember back in the late 90s, the media was discussing would they be made obsolete, which has now happened?
[01:27:35.439 --> 01:27:36.539]  This is Ed Paul Krugman.
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:42.621]  The growth of the Internet will slow drastically as the flaw
[01:27:44.574 --> 01:28:06.387]  In the law, McAfee's law, which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants, because apparent, most people have nothing to say to each other, by 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine.
[01:28:07.468 --> 01:28:11.010]  Now he made that sound real scientific and real smart, like an economist would.
[01:28:11.872 --> 01:28:13.113]  Who's giving you a false system.
[01:28:13.374 --> 01:28:15.136]  But has the Internet gotten bigger or smaller?
[01:28:15.476 --> 01:28:20.402]  It's gotten tens of thousands of times, logarithmically, exponentially bigger.
[01:28:21.003 --> 01:28:28.832]  And they say it's only gonna get bigger as it ties into the Internet of Things, exponentially as well, by the very architecture of how the Internet was built.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:36.422]  And by the early 1990s, all the big tech giants had already envisioned the current system we're under.
[01:28:36.762 --> 01:28:45.384]  But Krugman writes a piece of trash a couple times a week, sits around getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, and thinks he's a rocket scientist.
[01:28:46.605 --> 01:28:58.508]  Now this is almost as bad as people saying that Al Gore invented the Internet because in the 1990s he presided over some federal infrastructure agreements.
[01:28:59.639 --> 01:29:04.680]  The internet was invented by the United States and England and DARPA in the 1960s.
[01:29:05.601 --> 01:29:16.224]  My father, in Plan 2, in high school, in the mid-1960s, was introduced to the internet, to CD-ROM, to all of it, that supposedly didn't exist for decades.
[01:29:17.244 --> 01:29:20.065]  So let me just tell you, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:29:20.125 --> 01:29:28.327]  They've got some incredibly advanced stuff, but people like Krugman are so delusional, they're not even, I guess, aware of it.
[01:29:29.923 --> 01:29:30.243]  I think?
[01:29:48.089 --> 01:29:53.775]  Into some of the other big news that I was mentioning and covering here at the beginning of the segment.
[01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:59.080]  We're also going to open the phones up and take your calls ahead of guests in the third hour.
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:00.461]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.942 --> 01:30:02.543]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.484 --> 01:30:06.287]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.451 --> 01:30:12.133]  I'm going to lay it out short, sweet.
[01:30:13.912 --> 01:30:19.573]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:30:20.293 --> 01:30:24.274]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:30:25.134 --> 01:30:27.355]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:30:27.455 --> 01:30:28.595]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:30:28.615 --> 01:30:33.176]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat, or more.
[01:30:33.236 --> 01:30:35.656]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:30:35.677 --> 01:30:40.277]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22, when I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:30:40.497 --> 01:30:41.818]  It's actually scary.
[01:30:43.363 --> 01:30:53.468]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:30:54.448 --> 01:31:07.235]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[01:31:10.117 --> 01:31:17.482]  Social media platforms are coming under fire as families of the Orlando nightclub shooting victims are suing Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
[01:31:17.603 --> 01:31:26.129]  And the federal complaint argues that these web platforms, quote, provided terrorist group support for ISIS and the accounts they used to spread extremist propaganda.
[01:31:26.209 --> 01:31:37.357]  The families of these victims of the Orlando gay nightclub shooting on Monday this week filed a federal lawsuit against Twitter, Facebook, and Google for allegedly providing, quote, material support to ISIS.
[01:31:37.597 --> 01:31:40.080]  And helping them radicalize shooter Omar Mateen.
[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:43.023]  In this complaint, it was filed in the Eastern District of Michigan.
[01:31:43.103 --> 01:31:54.354]  The families of Tevin Crosby, Javier George Reyes, and Juan Rey Moguero, they argue that the three web platforms provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts they used to spread extremist propaganda.
[01:31:54.654 --> 01:31:58.098]  Raise funds and attract new recruits like Omar Mateen.
[01:31:58.158 --> 01:32:06.508]  Now, we've seen Facebook come under fire recently for censoring real news, but it looks like they're giving a platform to ISIS and victims' families are saying no more.
[01:32:06.728 --> 01:32:09.171]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:32:09.929 --> 01:32:10.409]  Not a group.
[01:32:10.450 --> 01:32:11.851]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:32:11.871 --> 01:32:12.972]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:32:13.232 --> 01:32:14.153]  Why is this so good?
[01:32:14.433 --> 01:32:19.678]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:32:19.758 --> 01:32:33.331]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:32:33.391 --> 01:32:34.752]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:32:35.513 --> 01:32:37.094]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:32:37.174 --> 01:32:39.676]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:32:39.756 --> 01:32:41.017]  These are all parasites.
[01:32:41.077 --> 01:32:42.178]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:32:42.198 --> 01:32:43.219]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:43.539 --> 01:32:47.882]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:32:48.063 --> 01:32:51.225]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:32:51.305 --> 01:32:54.387]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:54.427 --> 01:32:55.428]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:32:55.488 --> 01:32:57.369]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:57.429 --> 01:32:58.449]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:32:58.469 --> 01:33:00.531]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:33:01.171 --> 01:33:04.193]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[01:33:04.453 --> 01:33:06.354]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:33:06.715 --> 01:33:08.676]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:20.891 --> 01:33:23.872]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.952 --> 01:33:26.753]  How many times must I tell you, baby?
[01:33:27.493 --> 01:33:31.535]  How many bridges I've got to cross?
[01:33:31.635 --> 01:33:35.116]  How many times must I explain myself?
[01:33:35.176 --> 01:33:39.157]  Before I can talk to the boss.
[01:33:39.217 --> 01:33:41.278]  Before I can talk to the boss.
[01:33:41.678 --> 01:33:43.319]  Before I can talk to the boss.
[01:33:43.339 --> 01:33:44.559]  Before I can talk to the boss.
[01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:46.980]  Before I can talk to the boss.
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:48.280]  Before I can talk to the boss.
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:50.281]  Before I can talk to the boss.
[01:33:52.045 --> 01:33:54.385]  Well, I tell you, we are routing the new world order right now together.
[01:33:56.326 --> 01:34:02.167]  How many times before you finally understand?
[01:34:02.187 --> 01:34:08.328]  The globalists are trying to put a chip on everybody's shoulder.
[01:34:08.748 --> 01:34:10.129]  White, black, it doesn't matter.
[01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:17.210]  To just be obsessed over what color we are or where we came from, so that we're incompatible.
[01:34:18.154 --> 01:34:24.795]  Then that forces me to try to stop people from coming in who are being turned into armies of disgruntled dumbasses.
[01:34:26.115 --> 01:34:28.596]  But I don't hate these people individually for being sucked into this.
[01:34:29.136 --> 01:34:35.697]  But the controllers, like we see in the MTV video they've pulled... I'll do a special report for the Nightly News tonight showing other clips.
[01:34:36.457 --> 01:34:37.917]  They pulled this because of the backlash?
[01:34:38.217 --> 01:34:43.138]  There's stuff far worse where they're like, it is inherently bad to be white, and white men crying, I'm evil, I'm sorry!
[01:34:44.619 --> 01:34:46.679]  Yes, we need to eradicate white people.
[01:34:47.708 --> 01:34:51.235]  This is the type of garbage being pushed by MTV that is totally weaponized.
[01:34:51.796 --> 01:34:53.579]  Now you and I see this and wake up to it.
[01:34:54.641 --> 01:34:55.323]  And know it's wrong.
[01:34:58.148 --> 01:35:04.491]  But the problem is, on the college campuses, at the high schools, at the elementary schools, they show little kids from the U.S.
[01:35:04.511 --> 01:35:08.633]  to Australia to England, images of little bunny rabbits being killed.
[01:35:08.673 --> 01:35:09.434]  This has been in the news.
[01:35:10.234 --> 01:35:13.716]  Animals dying, seals dying, and say, you're killing them.
[01:35:14.276 --> 01:35:17.378]  And some middle school girls go and commit suicide after they see this.
[01:35:17.438 --> 01:35:18.278]  It's been in the news.
[01:35:18.638 --> 01:35:19.139]  All over the world.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:23.561]  Or they cry seeing an apartment complex.
[01:35:23.581 --> 01:35:26.803]  I was talking to one mother, and her daughter after public school was in the third grade,
[01:35:27.665 --> 01:35:36.949]  One of the girls came to one of the birthday parties for my daughter a few years ago, and her daughter started sobbing, going, they're murdering the bunnies that live in the field!
[01:35:37.549 --> 01:35:41.971]  They'd showed them water shipped down to the third graders.
[01:35:42.071 --> 01:35:45.072]  And this is how they're just inflicting them with mental illness.
[01:35:45.592 --> 01:35:46.453]  Not with empathy.
[01:35:47.433 --> 01:35:49.474]  Not with real stewardship of the earth.
[01:35:53.175 --> 01:35:54.796]  Now I want to get to the really serious news.
[01:35:56.638 --> 01:36:05.403]  Right now, you can again Google, Hillary calls for US military strikes on Russia in response to hacks.
[01:36:06.484 --> 01:36:09.005]  Or you can type in Biden, he gave a speech.
[01:36:10.066 --> 01:36:12.387]  Massive cyber attack triggered NATO response.
[01:36:12.907 --> 01:36:15.729]  Stotenberg, that was Reuters, he said including military.
[01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:20.932]  Because every time I mention this people, in fact print that for me please, they say, oh that couldn't be.
[01:36:21.012 --> 01:36:23.013]  I'm going to show you where they said it.
[01:36:23.813 --> 01:36:27.595]  Because I agree it's sensational, it sounds crazy, it doesn't sound true.
[01:36:28.375 --> 01:36:28.715]  It is.
[01:36:30.696 --> 01:36:36.678]  So the word is Obama called up Putin and said we're going to militarily attack you or start killing your people if you do this.
[01:36:36.698 --> 01:36:45.542]  You notice they've started assassinating the head of Russian intelligence got killed, the ambassador got killed, other guy got killed the same day at his house in Moscow, got shot to death.
[01:36:47.577 --> 01:36:48.177]  It's going on.
[01:36:51.219 --> 01:36:57.221]  But before I go there, I want to just because I've had this in the list since since Monday to play it.
[01:36:57.241 --> 01:36:57.901]  I've never played it.
[01:36:58.182 --> 01:37:02.663]  There's so many of these, but I don't want to just say universities are saying don't just say Christmas.
[01:37:02.924 --> 01:37:03.924]  Don't say holiday.
[01:37:05.425 --> 01:37:06.945]  I've got the clips all over the country.
[01:37:06.965 --> 01:37:08.286]  This isn't some isolated event.
[01:37:09.650 --> 01:37:19.892]  And all the good trendies, you know, adopt the new brainwashing, that all over the United States, they're saying ban Christmas, ban the celebration of it, do it now.
[01:37:22.072 --> 01:37:27.714]  So I thought we should realize this is going on with the children they've got targeted and with the college students.
[01:37:28.194 --> 01:37:30.834]  Again, they're saying don't hand out Christmas cards and things like that.
[01:37:31.134 --> 01:37:34.575]  That's your free speech in your own spare time to do whatever you want.
[01:37:36.323 --> 01:37:38.024]  You could hand out an invitation to come to a party.
[01:37:38.044 --> 01:37:40.766]  You could hand out little postcards that had your artwork on them.
[01:37:40.786 --> 01:37:47.071]  You could hand out postcards saying, please come to my church this Sunday and, and, and, you know, accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.
[01:37:49.052 --> 01:37:52.255]  Merry Christmas versus Happy Holidays, round 2016.
[01:37:52.295 --> 01:37:52.875]  Here's the clip.
[01:37:59.266 --> 01:38:05.374]  It's like a very Christian normative campus and so we feel like it's just not really a safe space for people of different faith traditions.
[01:38:14.246 --> 01:38:22.752]  Like this time of year it feels like people can like shove their like holiday like happiness in your face like yeah Merry Christmas like ooh and it's just you know it gets kind of old.
[01:38:22.772 --> 01:38:30.058]  So we're just sending a letter to the administration to be like hey like this can be like almost oppressive for some people um would you guys like to sign?
[01:38:30.378 --> 01:38:31.058]  I will totally sign.
[01:38:31.099 --> 01:38:31.399]  Awesome yeah.
[01:38:31.419 --> 01:38:33.440]  Totally agree with what you're saying.
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:38.284]  Yeah like the Christmas lights and uh there's been rumors like a Christmas tree is going to be going up and like
[01:38:38.664 --> 01:38:42.387]  Things like that just kind of feels like for the non-Christmas-celebrating students.
[01:38:59.961 --> 01:39:07.485]  Thank you so much.
[01:39:07.945 --> 01:39:14.909]  I feel like people have been socialized to like it's almost oppressive that they don't even know like what Christmas really means which is like a Christian holiday.
[01:39:15.389 --> 01:39:20.172]  Like Christians have a lot of privilege on campus because it's like a lot of the holiday stuff is usually geared towards them.
[01:39:20.532 --> 01:39:28.148]  The Christmas spirit, everything that comes along with that of people, like, assuming that we want to accept gifts and assuming that we want to, like, send presents everywhere.
[01:39:28.168 --> 01:39:28.488]  Oh, that's good.
[01:39:28.529 --> 01:39:31.675]  And see, what they're doing is they want to overthrow...
[01:39:33.052 --> 01:39:37.154]  What's already existing in this country and then replace it with what?
[01:39:37.574 --> 01:39:38.554]  Corporate worship.
[01:39:38.834 --> 01:39:40.195]  Political correctness worship.
[01:39:40.515 --> 01:39:42.295]  White people are inherently bad worship.
[01:39:42.556 --> 01:39:44.596]  Let's all have chips on our shoulders worship.
[01:39:45.277 --> 01:39:45.977]  Mental illness.
[01:39:46.257 --> 01:39:52.960]  What does a mega banking cartel that's robbing you of your freedoms, robbing you of your money, robbing you of your future, robbing you of your culture do?
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:59.262]  It does this type of psychological warfare stuff to turn people into gibbering nutcases.
[01:40:01.664 --> 01:40:30.623]  These people going to get college educations, 90 plus percent of the time, will never pay off the student loans, in many cases, or, the statistic of 90% is, and or, it's both these things, something like 50% pay off the loans, you can look it up for yourself, it varies, and, you know, something like 50% as well, but they kind of actuary it together, it's close to 90%, you can pull this up, will never either pay off the loans or get a job in the field they actually got a degree for.
[01:40:31.583 --> 01:40:32.925]  Most degrees are worthless.
[01:40:33.305 --> 01:40:47.540]  If you want one in engineering, or you want one, you know, like an EMT certificate, or a law enforcement certificate, or a nurse certificate, those type of jobs, you can probably, you know, live a decent, you know, paycheck off that for the degree you paid for.
[01:40:49.362 --> 01:40:50.443]  But not with teaching degrees.
[01:40:51.567 --> 01:40:58.588]  You're probably never, with a standard teaching certificate, going to even make back the money you have spent on the education.
[01:40:59.129 --> 01:41:01.829]  And it's not going to compete with a comparable job mowing lawns.
[01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:06.270]  You know how many people I know that hustle, knock on doors, that do good jobs mowing lawns?
[01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:15.932]  I know people that have two or three trucks working for them, that started, I know Hispanics, and I know black, and I know white business owners, that have mixed crews, you name it.
[01:41:17.318 --> 01:41:19.019]  Some have pure Hispanic crews.
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:19.980]  That tends to be Hispanics.
[01:41:20.681 --> 01:41:21.922]  It's not racist because they're Hispanic.
[01:41:22.242 --> 01:41:22.563]  Whatever.
[01:41:22.583 --> 01:41:24.124]  The point is, that's the crew, as folks, they know.
[01:41:24.524 --> 01:41:25.245]  It's homogeneous.
[01:41:25.765 --> 01:41:28.608]  Who are making $200,000 a year living in McMansions and driving $500,000, you know, $50,000 cars around.
[01:41:28.628 --> 01:41:30.830]  I'm going from memory or something, bumbling around.
[01:41:38.436 --> 01:41:52.900]  The point is that I know a lot of people that have working class jobs, that own plumber companies, lighting companies, you name it, that are living like kings, their employees are paid good, they're doing well, and they don't have college degrees.
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:53.540]  That's well known.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:59.421]  That most of the billionaires in this country didn't go to college or quit college because they're outside of the box.
[01:41:59.862 --> 01:42:00.962]  You go to college,
[01:42:02.366 --> 01:42:15.218]  To basically learn how to conform and be put into a managed economy cog and then to socially go along with the cult programming of the corporate cult that's being set up.
[01:42:15.936 --> 01:42:25.419]  And the corporate cult changes all the time, so there's always new downloads of the new way, the new political correctness, the new terms to use.
[01:42:25.939 --> 01:42:32.641]  And then you're promoted on how you follow those orders like a little brainwashed corporate Borg minion.
[01:42:35.299 --> 01:42:37.740]  Let me just pause for a moment, because this is really getting me wound up.
[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:47.282]  I think I'm on a roll today, but I tend to get too upset, too excited, my brain starts going too fast, and I start getting facts wrong and jumbling words.
[01:42:47.302 --> 01:43:03.705]  Let me just... But imagine, I'm up here ranting for hours, exposing this to the public, going over it, reminding you how obscene these people are, and it's important to have a pit stop and take a break for a moment.
[01:43:05.788 --> 01:43:07.109]  And just cool off for a second.
[01:43:07.629 --> 01:43:08.910]  Cool off like Fonzie.
[01:43:09.651 --> 01:43:10.791]  Cool off and relax.
[01:43:11.432 --> 01:43:12.413]  There we go.
[01:43:12.533 --> 01:43:14.934]  Now we can refocus.
[01:43:16.255 --> 01:43:18.737]  I haven't even scratched the surface of the news, but I've been a good boy.
[01:43:19.277 --> 01:43:27.503]  I've probably covered 60 or more big articles, and I've only got 200 more.
[01:43:27.563 --> 01:43:28.684]  Today's a big news day.
[01:43:28.744 --> 01:43:30.104]  I've got at least 200 more.
[01:43:32.062 --> 01:43:34.864]  By the way, you think I just say 200 more looking at my articles?
[01:43:35.405 --> 01:43:41.590]  I bet you money that if I count these articles, it's 200, or close to it, or more.
[01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:43.691]  I've learned what these stacks are.
[01:43:44.012 --> 01:43:50.857]  This little stack that's only an inch deep, I got a four-inch stack right there, I bet it's 20 articles.
[01:43:51.057 --> 01:43:54.100]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[01:43:56.706 --> 01:44:04.810]  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, this is so enjoyable, not just focusing on the globalists for a minute, just doing something mindless.
[01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.810]  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.
[01:44:05.871 --> 01:44:09.713]  I said that was 20, it's 23.
[01:44:25.586 --> 01:44:33.410]  I bet that stack that's almost four inches tall, I bet that's 80 articles.
[01:44:34.891 --> 01:44:35.611]  So that's a hundred.
[01:44:35.631 --> 01:44:37.772]  You add all these together, I bet it's 200.
[01:44:38.733 --> 01:44:41.194]  I bet it's a... Again, I'm not just saying stuff here.
[01:44:41.234 --> 01:44:42.354]  I mean, I live this every day.
[01:44:42.394 --> 01:44:47.957]  I know what 200 articles are that I've looked at before I went on air.
[01:44:47.977 --> 01:44:53.120]  Can you imagine the headache I get looking at these sniveling maggots and what they're doing?
[01:44:54.150 --> 01:44:55.291]  I'm so sick of these people.
[01:44:55.311 --> 01:45:00.994]  And then I get to have a reporter here ask me questions like, so you really think they're setting up a world government?
[01:45:01.815 --> 01:45:03.295]  And I just, my eyes glaze over.
[01:45:03.596 --> 01:45:06.137]  You want to see 500 news articles announcing it?
[01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:12.621]  I've got articles here in the stack.
[01:45:14.008 --> 01:45:23.731]  I said I'd take calls, and now there's no time in this hour because I've got David Knight popping in the next segment with big breaking news that's incredibly poignant, incredibly saddening, that you must see, dealing with Islam.
[01:45:24.411 --> 01:45:27.452]  Probably some of the sickest video I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot from Islam, isn't it?
[01:45:27.932 --> 01:45:30.173]  Oh, it's not Islam, Al Qaeda, ISIS, I understand.
[01:45:30.453 --> 01:45:31.754]  Where are the Muslims decrying it?
[01:45:32.174 --> 01:45:38.476]  A lot of Muslims don't support this, they're afraid they're going to get targeted, because nobody gets bullied more than Muslims by Muslims.
[01:45:39.445 --> 01:45:47.418]  That's why it gets so extreme, because there's a contest to see who can be the most abusive, who can be the most out of control, who can be the most bullying.
[01:45:47.478 --> 01:45:52.847]  Instead of the West, trying to see who can be the most liberated, the most free, the most open.
[01:45:53.919 --> 01:46:03.422]  And then now that's hijacked by extreme leftists who are so leftist they're fascist, trying to end all of our freedoms in the name of delivering us to a heavenly abode.
[01:46:03.743 --> 01:46:05.023]  That's called a cult.
[01:46:05.503 --> 01:46:06.644]  They are a cult.
[01:46:06.904 --> 01:46:10.865]  I don't say that rhetorically or with rhetoric to make my point.
[01:46:10.985 --> 01:46:20.969]  They are, by scientific design, the scientific dictatorship's idea of human sabotage so they can control us.
[01:46:21.986 --> 01:46:38.281]  It's the rearguard action as they steal the future, running into the future, with the future under their arm, hoping we sit around in the dirt, fighting with each other, while they hijack humanity with their giant breakaway society system.
[01:46:39.721 --> 01:46:43.184]  But before I go any further, I didn't plug last hour, so I'm going to plug a couple times this hour.
[01:46:43.545 --> 01:46:45.026]  We're running the biggest specials.
[01:46:45.046 --> 01:46:46.247]  In fact, we did an analysis.
[01:46:46.568 --> 01:46:47.749]  We're now running the biggest specials.
[01:46:47.769 --> 01:46:59.620]  We've had some big specials this year, but this is the biggest with free shipping, with the auto ship, 10% off additionally, with 50% off colloidal silver, 33% off a bunch of the other nutraceuticals.
[01:46:59.921 --> 01:47:01.042]  The lowest special is 25% off.
[01:47:02.623 --> 01:47:03.364]  On one of the items.
[01:47:03.964 --> 01:47:04.965]  Which one of those is that?
[01:47:05.205 --> 01:47:06.726]  That's DNA for us, but it's sold out.
[01:47:07.286 --> 01:47:08.407]  And, oh, that's the big point.
[01:47:08.867 --> 01:47:14.031]  Most of this is going to sell out by the new year, which was my plan.
[01:47:15.172 --> 01:47:16.452]  But we did a little bit too good a job.
[01:47:16.473 --> 01:47:18.194]  I wanted to have some inventory going into next year.
[01:47:18.214 --> 01:47:24.318]  But I didn't want to pay too much, you know, that we have a state tax here in Texas on inventory.
[01:47:24.718 --> 01:47:26.419]  Oh, franchise tax and all this other garbage.
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:31.543]  So, yeah, we're a low-tax state, but still that didn't stand much in one of the, you know, overtaxed countries.
[01:47:32.714 --> 01:48:00.640]  And so we're going to sell out of the toothpaste, it's got iodine and a little silver in it, the super metal vitality, survival shield x2, silver bullet it looks like it's about to sell out, the living defense, parasite cleanse, bio PCA, bio true selenium, secret 12, our biome defense probiotic that is the best we could develop with the top companies out there, this is a true game changer, check out biome defense, it's got 5.7 stars, vitamin mineral fusion,
[01:48:01.772 --> 01:48:02.712]  I thought that'd be a big hit.
[01:48:02.752 --> 01:48:03.733]  That's not one of our big hits.
[01:48:03.813 --> 01:48:09.674]  It's one of the best vitamin, mineral, fruit punches out there with the amino acids, you name it, and it's concentrated.
[01:48:09.694 --> 01:48:13.716]  It only has 4.7 stars, which is incredible, and it's not one of our best sellers.
[01:48:14.096 --> 01:48:15.036]  I use it every day and love it.
[01:48:15.176 --> 01:48:15.716]  I don't know why.
[01:48:15.736 --> 01:48:17.557]  I thought that'd be our best seller, but it isn't.
[01:48:18.117 --> 01:48:19.077]  You ought to take advantage of that.
[01:48:19.097 --> 01:48:20.578]  That's something that isn't close to selling out.
[01:48:21.018 --> 01:48:24.399]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:48:24.439 --> 01:48:24.979]  And by the way,
[01:48:28.411 --> 01:48:33.592]  One of the best ways to get your kids to take a multivitamin, if it's a hard multivitamin, most of those go right to your kids.
[01:48:34.473 --> 01:48:35.473]  It's been proven in studies.
[01:48:35.493 --> 01:48:38.254]  I don't want to get into it, but everybody knows most of the hard pills go out.
[01:48:38.534 --> 01:48:41.255]  So what we have is liquid, so you absorb almost all of it.
[01:48:41.735 --> 01:48:42.555]  Powdered's good too.
[01:48:42.575 --> 01:48:46.876]  If it's in a powdered capulet, a lot of that gets absorbed, because it turns into powder in the intestines.
[01:48:49.117 --> 01:48:50.437]  In the stomach and the intestines.
[01:48:50.457 --> 01:48:51.898]  So you do get good absorption.
[01:48:52.138 --> 01:48:56.499]  But nothing like under your tongue, like a lot of our products, or drinking it,
[01:48:57.438 --> 01:49:09.946]  So it mixes with the saliva, digestion begins, it gets absorbed in the mouth, the esophagus, the esophageal membrane, and then it goes in the stomach, and then the upper and lower intestines, the large and small intestines, so more of it gets absorbed.
[01:49:11.487 --> 01:49:12.227]  It's amazing.
[01:49:12.568 --> 01:49:12.988]  I love it.
[01:49:14.008 --> 01:49:22.574]  When I first advertised that, a little bit of, you know, sampler container in my hand, that's half the size of the real container, but even the real container itself is concentrated, so it's the same price as leading competitors, but it doesn't matter.
[01:49:22.994 --> 01:49:24.895]  I'm not in competition with Beyond Tangy Tangerine.
[01:49:25.296 --> 01:49:25.416]  It's
[01:49:27.075 --> 01:49:30.337]  Rare Earth Mineral basically derives super high-quality.
[01:49:30.758 --> 01:49:34.300]  Infowars, team.com, you buy it there, it helps fund the operation.
[01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:36.622]  Vitamineral Fusion is plant-derived.
[01:49:36.662 --> 01:49:38.022]  So, two different systems.
[01:49:39.243 --> 01:49:40.604]  I would put them on par with each other.
[01:49:41.685 --> 01:49:45.287]  My kids, personally, one of my kids likes our Vitamineral Fusion.
[01:49:45.667 --> 01:49:50.691]  The other two like the original Beyond Tangy Tangerine, which is still my favorite.
[01:49:50.711 --> 01:49:52.672]  They have the 2.0, it's totally organic.
[01:49:55.089 --> 01:49:55.710]  I don't like it as much.
[01:50:13.706 --> 01:50:15.086]  We're good to go.
[01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:50.012]  Now, we're going to come back after break and plunge into Obama still trying to start World War III with 29 days out.
[01:50:50.992 --> 01:50:54.013]  29 days, ladies and gentlemen, until Trump's in.
[01:50:54.053 --> 01:50:55.253]  And what else will they try then?
[01:50:55.813 --> 01:51:01.754]  I will open the phone some of the next hour, even though we're going to have guests in here, because I want to get your take on how they may try to sabotage Trump.
[01:51:01.814 --> 01:51:03.255]  I want to crowdsource your knowledge.
[01:51:03.575 --> 01:51:05.175]  I want to get your take on that straight ahead.
[01:51:05.195 --> 01:51:05.235]  800-259-9231.
[01:51:05.255 --> 01:51:05.535]  Stay with us.
[01:51:09.898 --> 01:51:19.443]  Google was complicit by killing Google Reader, which RSS, which is still a great distribution mechanism, gives you, in fact, a feed very much like a Twitter or a Facebook feed.
[01:51:19.923 --> 01:51:32.369]  When Google Reader was purposely destroyed, the whole idea of RSS kind of fell apart, but it's slowly coming back now, and you see the epic battle between the mainstream against Silicon Valley.
[01:51:32.509 --> 01:51:39.633]  All day now I hear on mainstream is, well, you know, these guys are dangerous now, and so this is going to be an interesting butting of heads.
[01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:43.694]  I see there's all sorts of other things that are going to bite the mainstream dinosaur media in the butt.
[01:51:44.054 --> 01:51:45.235]  We're the least of their problems.
[01:51:45.495 --> 01:51:47.275]  It's going to be all these other distribution platforms.
[01:51:47.936 --> 01:51:50.616]  Yes, and not only that, but different business models.
[01:51:50.636 --> 01:51:55.678]  You have a phenomenally interesting and I think obviously successful business model.
[01:51:56.478 --> 01:52:01.682]  Um, with your entire InfoWars life and all your, all the pro- I mean, hey, that's how I got turned on to you.
[01:52:01.722 --> 01:52:05.345]  I got Berkey water filter, I got my one acre crisis seed garden.
[01:52:05.365 --> 01:52:05.565]  Thank you.
[01:52:05.585 --> 01:52:06.606]  I got my meals ready to eat.
[01:52:06.666 --> 01:52:08.427]  So obviously we have our own distribution.
[01:52:08.627 --> 01:52:12.130]  Um, it may get a little complicated, you know, they may start to shut things down.
[01:52:12.170 --> 01:52:16.093]  But I think, look at how WikiLeaks, everyone got around it, you know, that's kind of unstoppable.
[01:52:16.113 --> 01:52:19.915]  The internet in that regard I think is still pretty- Sure, that's where they're starting is just stealth painting.
[01:52:20.176 --> 01:52:22.577]  Oh sorry, you can't share InfoWars links as of yesterday.
[01:52:22.697 --> 01:52:23.058]  On Facebook.
[01:52:23.818 --> 01:52:24.759]  Well, on Reddit.
[01:52:24.979 --> 01:52:26.961]  Facebook, it's selective, only some of our links.
[01:52:27.241 --> 01:52:32.365]  It's on Reddit, it's just, yeah, you can't... Right, so, but... If you have a million votes, it won't go up.
[01:52:32.825 --> 01:52:33.245]  That's right.
[01:52:34.306 --> 01:52:38.029]  But that's why advertising online, I don't see a future in that.
[01:52:38.189 --> 01:52:45.094]  It's total censorship and how they're dressing up, their most draconian, book-burning, attack on free speech the world's ever seen.
[01:52:45.114 --> 01:52:47.476]  It's just the bravado of it.
[01:52:47.836 --> 01:52:49.437]  Yeah, I mean, so... But Gary!
[01:52:49.537 --> 01:52:55.660]  Under McCarthyism, there was something called the Communists, and you had the, you know, the Committee to Save America from the Communists.
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:58.081]  Now it's the evil patriots that want to make America great again.
[01:52:58.281 --> 01:53:00.502]  We gotta shut them up because they're Russian agents!
[01:53:00.942 --> 01:53:02.063]  Who the hell believes that?
[01:53:02.303 --> 01:53:09.827]  But fake news is oxymoronic in that news is, by definition, extemporaneous and open to revision.
[01:53:10.187 --> 01:53:11.648]  They say it's the first draft of history.
[01:53:11.688 --> 01:53:16.030]  So a lot of what's reported as news, later it's like, well, you know, in the heat of the battle,
[01:53:16.630 --> 01:53:22.273]  We looked at it after six months and we revised what was then considered news and this is more of the historical document.
[01:53:22.553 --> 01:53:25.955]  So to say that's fake news is again, it's an oxymoron.
[01:53:26.115 --> 01:53:33.940]  All news to some degree would have some degree of subjectivity to it, would have some degree of- But these are the people saying kill Donald Trump- News is not pure.
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:36.441]  It's not a pure- It comes out- It's all propaganda.
[01:53:36.601 --> 01:53:37.702]  Whole cloth and pure.
[01:53:38.002 --> 01:53:40.804]  News has in many times has errors in it.
[01:53:41.004 --> 01:53:42.184]  You try to do the best that you can.
[01:53:42.405 --> 01:53:44.866]  But to say it's fake news is to say we don't want any news.
[01:53:44.906 --> 01:53:45.926]  We want only propaganda.
[01:53:46.106 --> 01:53:47.187]  It comes from one source.
[01:53:47.467 --> 01:53:55.789]  It's like Britain's become a totalitarian propaganda state, where the state is now dictating everything that comes out in any major news source.
[01:53:55.890 --> 01:54:01.411]  The UK regulator gives us scripts to read on our show, and then they accuse us of propaganda.
[01:54:01.591 --> 01:54:07.133]  The regulator gives us scripts that are detailing our position on energy companies in the UK.
[01:54:07.173 --> 01:54:09.534]  They threaten to take RT off the air in the UK.
[01:54:14.578 --> 01:54:15.539]  I was a highwayman.
[01:54:15.599 --> 01:54:16.820]  I was a highwayman.
[01:54:17.741 --> 01:54:20.042]  Along the coach roads I did ride.
[01:54:20.103 --> 01:54:21.804]  Sword and pistol by my side.
[01:54:22.064 --> 01:54:24.966]  With sword and pistol by my side.
[01:54:24.986 --> 01:54:27.168]  Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade.
[01:54:27.328 --> 01:54:30.591]  Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade.
[01:54:30.631 --> 01:54:31.431]  Many a soldier.
[01:54:33.253 --> 01:54:38.056]  Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
[01:54:39.017 --> 01:54:42.600]  The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five.
[01:54:46.194 --> 01:54:47.395]  Through the progeny.
[01:54:48.935 --> 01:54:50.416]  Alright, David Knight's our guest.
[01:54:50.556 --> 01:54:57.939]  Start of the next hour, I'm going to get into the World War III Obama's trying to start, and we're in more danger now than before.
[01:55:00.199 --> 01:55:00.860]  Understand that.
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:03.481]  This is very, very serious.
[01:55:03.521 --> 01:55:07.222]  I'm going to show you where NATO says they want physical war with Russia.
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:15.282]  And then we're going to have Leanne McAdoo in here along with Owen and other great reporters to give their views just on year-end, what's happened, what they think is coming.
[01:55:15.302 --> 01:55:17.123]  I'm going to try to spice some of your calls in.
[01:55:17.163 --> 01:55:18.843]  I gave that number out so we went to break.
[01:55:18.863 --> 01:55:21.384]  So we'll launch that phone system 800-259-9231.
[01:55:22.744 --> 01:55:29.006]  But David Knight, I've encouraged David and the reporters, when something's really hardcore I've missed and you think it's important, I respect our crew.
[01:55:29.506 --> 01:55:32.187]  If there aren't guests on at that time or there's something breaking, go ahead and just come in.
[01:55:33.127 --> 01:55:33.967]  Bring us the news.
[01:55:34.347 --> 01:55:37.408]  He's got something really sad he showed me about 20 minutes ago during the last break.
[01:55:37.768 --> 01:55:41.469]  So I asked him to show you this and talk about it here in this segment and in the next.
[01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:44.370]  So we're going to be breaking that down right now.
[01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:50.052]  You know, if you're a TV viewer, I have this beautiful shot of the Christmas tree time-lapse last night.
[01:55:50.072 --> 01:55:51.492]  We actually have a time-lapse.
[01:55:51.552 --> 01:55:52.072]  It's amazing.
[01:55:52.152 --> 01:55:54.693]  And the Capitol that our great crew shot.
[01:55:55.433 --> 01:55:59.397]  And I look at that and think Islamists just want to run people over and kill families at these.
[01:55:59.957 --> 01:56:06.283]  And then meanwhile, David Knight has footage and a story about a mother training her little children to be suicide bombers.
[01:56:06.363 --> 01:56:08.705]  I mean, this is mind control.
[01:56:09.106 --> 01:56:10.387]  Pure demonic evil.
[01:56:10.867 --> 01:56:17.994]  And our leftist media is in bed with it and thinks it's sexy and says the Russian ambassador deserved to die.
[01:56:18.394 --> 01:56:20.797]  So David Knight, tell us about the sickeningness.
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:25.784]  Well, you know, Alex, I was shooting an interview for the Nightly News and my wife had sent me this story.
[01:56:25.824 --> 01:56:26.765]  It's now on Drudge.
[01:56:27.225 --> 01:56:37.254]  People can find it there, but we had a story yesterday from Syrian Girl, and she was talking about a seven-year-old that had been used as a suicide bomber for the Syria
[01:56:38.596 --> 01:56:39.776]  At the Syria Police Station.
[01:56:40.397 --> 01:56:47.183]  And now we've got footage of a mother who is kissing her children goodbye as suicide bombers.
[01:56:47.423 --> 01:56:49.605]  Seven-year-old girl and a nine-year-old girl.
[01:56:49.705 --> 01:56:51.346]  And Alex, this is just gut-wrenching.
[01:56:51.927 --> 01:56:54.309]  This is nothing but a cult of death.
[01:56:54.589 --> 01:56:56.971]  And then the sickening, evil, demonic dad comes in.
[01:56:56.991 --> 01:56:57.051]  Yes.
[01:56:57.071 --> 01:56:58.272]  I mean, I'm going to be honest.
[01:56:58.392 --> 01:57:00.434]  I just instinctively want to attack him.
[01:57:00.916 --> 01:57:04.799]  Well, you look at what's happening, and of course the guy has been identified as someone who's with Al Nusra.
[01:57:05.179 --> 01:57:09.262]  We were told back in 2013 that Al Nusra was part of the moderate rebels.
[01:57:09.302 --> 01:57:12.884]  We had two CIA agents meeting with them.
[01:57:12.944 --> 01:57:15.205]  God, this is such child abuse.
[01:57:15.786 --> 01:57:18.067]  Obama and Hillary on the left are backing these people.
[01:57:18.428 --> 01:57:19.448]  Why are they so evil?
[01:57:19.748 --> 01:57:20.889]  Why do they hate Christianity?
[01:57:20.909 --> 01:57:21.710]  I'm talking about the liberals.
[01:57:22.267 --> 01:57:22.487]  Yeah.
[01:57:22.707 --> 01:57:26.809]  Well, they were meeting openly with him back in 2013, telling us they're moderate rebels.
[01:57:27.089 --> 01:57:33.392]  Then in 2015, we were told that by Petraeus, hey, we need to use Al-Nusra against Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:34.112 --> 01:57:35.133]  They are the same thing.
[01:57:35.173 --> 01:57:38.014]  They try to pretend they're distinct groups, and then they say that they're the same.
[01:57:38.414 --> 01:57:46.318]  But when you look at this video, you look at this woman who is dressed head-to-toe in black, like some kind of death cult figure, and that's what it is.
[01:57:46.658 --> 01:57:49.599]  This is like the Grim Reaper, but that's her own children.
[01:57:49.639 --> 01:57:50.960]  You know, in our country,
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:57.805]  Mothers usually cry when they drop their kids off to school in the first grade for the first time, abandoning them.
[01:57:57.865 --> 01:58:04.491]  She's hugging them to send them off to blow people up in Aleppo, and then our media literally backs these rebels and acts like they're rock stars.
[01:58:04.731 --> 01:58:07.333]  They have Netflix shows, HBO shows.
[01:58:07.874 --> 01:58:08.975]  Man, I'm sick of these people.
[01:58:09.454 --> 01:58:10.915]  We need to take the gloves off.
[01:58:10.975 --> 01:58:11.875]  We need to call it what it is.
[01:58:11.895 --> 01:58:12.935]  You said it's a cult.
[01:58:13.056 --> 01:58:14.256]  It is a cult of death.
[01:58:14.836 --> 01:58:16.357]  It's a satanic death cult.
[01:58:16.417 --> 01:58:17.397]  It's a satanic death cult.
[01:58:17.417 --> 01:58:20.519]  Let me tell you, this form of Islam is satanism.
[01:58:21.059 --> 01:58:22.760]  They've made a sacrament of death.
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:26.101]  And that's why we see the types of things that we saw at a Christmas market this week.
[01:58:26.141 --> 01:58:29.743]  And that's why we see this type of thing with a mother using her children.
[01:58:29.943 --> 01:58:34.224]  They sent them into this police station, blew them up, remote control.
[01:58:34.244 --> 01:58:34.865]  That's right.
[01:58:35.745 --> 01:58:45.633]  I want to come back and talk more about this and I want to take this very live clip right now, excise it out and post it to YouTube to just show the world the type of pure evil we're dealing with.
[01:58:45.653 --> 01:58:53.140]  A mother and father prepared to murder their children for Islam and the left won't say a damn word because they hate this country so much.
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:54.421]  They're cuckold!
[01:58:55.222 --> 01:58:55.742]  We'll be back.
[01:58:55.762 --> 01:58:56.543]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:08.927]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[01:59:09.908 --> 01:59:14.552]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption.
[01:59:15.153 --> 01:59:18.736]  And a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[01:59:19.116 --> 01:59:22.999]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[01:59:23.079 --> 01:59:26.062]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[01:59:26.082 --> 01:59:27.583]  We now have George Soros
[01:59:28.664 --> 01:59:35.889]  As a goblin on the back and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:40.992]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[01:59:43.234 --> 01:59:50.338]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[01:59:50.679 --> 01:59:51.219]  It's powerful.
[01:59:51.239 --> 01:59:52.320]  I hope you get out to everybody you know.
[01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:54.321]  InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:00:02.017 --> 02:00:06.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:00:06.641 --> 02:00:08.002]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.489 --> 02:00:21.012]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:21.552 --> 02:00:23.254]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.376 --> 02:00:35.917]  Think of the beauty of Merle Haggard's voice.
[02:00:37.979 --> 02:00:44.383]  And then think about the ugliness of orthodox Islam and what it's mutated into.
[02:00:44.403 --> 02:00:47.265]  Say some prayers for those little girls.
[02:00:47.285 --> 02:00:49.066]  Total evil.
[02:00:51.244 --> 02:00:52.965]  We've got to do what we've got to do, don't we?
[02:00:53.565 --> 02:01:02.990]  Glove's got to come off with the sickening satanic left, and the spirit cookers, and the pedophiles, and the abortionists that are involved in all this evil.
[02:01:04.391 --> 02:01:06.212]  The selling of the Chinese baby's parts.
[02:01:06.892 --> 02:01:09.494]  Falun Gong being executed because they're Buddhist.
[02:01:10.154 --> 02:01:11.675]  The exercise of religion and peace.
[02:01:12.615 --> 02:01:14.116]  Not a word from the State Department.
[02:01:14.636 --> 02:01:15.917]  Not a word from the globalists.
[02:01:17.014 --> 02:01:22.536]  Other than celebrating it and saying China runs our lives, Islam runs our lives, Sharia law is the way to go.
[02:01:23.676 --> 02:01:27.318]  There's a sickening report out of the Southern Poverty Law Center that's been totally discredited.
[02:01:27.338 --> 02:01:29.579]  Obviously law enforcement doesn't even use them anymore.
[02:01:30.799 --> 02:01:36.321]  Where they say Trump's National Security Advisor Twitter account shows extent of anti-Muslim beliefs.
[02:01:36.681 --> 02:01:41.163]  They talk about General Flynn, the former head of military intelligence, Pentagon intelligence.
[02:01:42.242 --> 02:01:50.747]  Very senior rank in intelligence, about as high as it gets, exposing that our government was backing al-Nusra and al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria, and saying we shouldn't do it.
[02:01:50.807 --> 02:01:52.268]  So Obama relieved him three years ago.
[02:01:52.608 --> 02:01:54.849]  Now he's the Chief National Security Advisor to President Trump.
[02:01:56.130 --> 02:02:06.216]  And they have quotes in here like saying Islam kills children, Islam is dominant in areas it exists, we can't coexist with orthodox Islam, it's rational to fear Islam, they're going to attack us.
[02:02:07.176 --> 02:02:08.457]  That's like saying the sky's blue,
[02:02:09.875 --> 02:02:13.580]  And then they attack him for saying it and bringing it up and say remove him.
[02:02:14.588 --> 02:02:20.989]  And Chris Hayes tries to cover up Islamic attacks in Europe with these 18 wheelers running over children in Nice and in Berlin.
[02:02:21.229 --> 02:02:31.251]  And now we have footage released by al-Nusra themselves of their little five and six-year-old daughters going to suicide bomb and blow themselves up and the mother kissing them and hugging them.
[02:02:31.751 --> 02:02:33.272]  And what does Flynn say in the article?
[02:02:33.332 --> 02:02:35.532]  He goes, where is Islam decrying the bombings?
[02:02:35.912 --> 02:02:37.813]  No one decries it in Islam when they do it.
[02:02:38.133 --> 02:02:39.993]  Is it out of fear or do they support this?
[02:02:40.413 --> 02:02:53.611]  I want to hear Islam decry blowing up little girls to kill other innocent people, and I want to hear the left decry it and stop pushing it like the folks in Aleppo are heroes when the Russians and the Syrians valiantly battle this scum!
[02:02:54.352 --> 02:02:54.873]  David Knight.
[02:02:55.871 --> 02:02:58.854]  See, you know, we're always hearing from the liberals that we gotta do it for the children.
[02:02:58.874 --> 02:02:59.915]  Let's do it for these children.
[02:03:00.236 --> 02:03:01.317]  Let's protect women.
[02:03:01.377 --> 02:03:04.080]  Look at the woman who is covered up here in a black burka.
[02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:05.141]  You can't even see her face.
[02:03:05.581 --> 02:03:06.943]  Let's do it for the LGBT community.
[02:03:06.983 --> 02:03:08.144]  In a shroud of death!
[02:03:08.484 --> 02:03:09.525]  In a shroud of death!
[02:03:09.926 --> 02:03:10.787]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:03:11.167 --> 02:03:23.236]  All the groups, LGBT people as well, all the groups that the Democrats say they're there to protect, these are the people that are being attacked specifically, and most directly, by these Islamists.
[02:03:23.276 --> 02:03:26.719]  But of course they want to kill everyone who isn't a part of their cult of death.
[02:03:26.779 --> 02:03:30.182]  And they even want to kill their own children as part of that cult of death.
[02:03:30.442 --> 02:03:31.783]  This is the disgusting thing here.
[02:03:31.903 --> 02:03:33.285]  Look how sad the little one is.
[02:03:33.305 --> 02:03:34.647]  Look how they look like zombies.
[02:03:34.747 --> 02:03:34.908]  Yes.
[02:03:35.328 --> 02:03:38.072]  And then she just leans up against her mother wishing she'd get love.
[02:03:38.253 --> 02:03:46.045]  And instead, she gets to put a belt of plastic on her with nails in it that blow her into pieces because her satanic mother is a frickin' demon!
[02:03:46.698 --> 02:03:47.719]  That's absolutely insane.
[02:03:47.759 --> 02:03:48.459]  And Alex, you know what?
[02:03:48.939 --> 02:04:05.350]  When we're hearing Obama talking about pushing against the Russians and we're going to look for a provocation so we can go against them, understand what Obama is trying to do to your children or, depending on your age, maybe it's your mother and father who are soldiers that are going to be sent to die for this guy who is part of a suicide cult himself.
[02:04:05.370 --> 02:04:06.391]  And let's not forget,
[02:04:07.071 --> 02:04:12.796]  They've got shows all over TV worshipping the rebels, saying they're angels, when 98% of them are Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Al-Nusra.
[02:04:13.036 --> 02:04:14.137]  Al-Nusra is Al-Qaeda.
[02:04:14.317 --> 02:04:16.199]  That flag behind him is the Al-Qaeda flag.
[02:04:16.879 --> 02:04:20.862]  Our media backs all this while we've got at least a thousand U.S.
[02:04:20.922 --> 02:04:23.745]  troops, special forces battling.
[02:04:24.465 --> 02:04:27.108]  Dozens and dozens have died this year in the battle.
[02:04:27.808 --> 02:04:31.693]  While schizophrenically Obama sits there giving support to the rebels.
[02:04:31.953 --> 02:04:37.560]  So the Pentagon's been ignoring Obama for three years and has been doing things that Obama dare not challenge.
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:40.724]  That's how the civil war is really going in this country, David.
[02:04:41.411 --> 02:04:49.274]  You know, Alex, as I mentioned before, going back to 2012, when they were trying to sell the idea that there was this gas attack, which we eventually learned was not the Syrian government.
[02:04:49.454 --> 02:04:52.215]  They were saying, we're going to use these different rebel groups against the other rebel groups.
[02:04:52.235 --> 02:04:53.075]  They're all connected.
[02:04:53.515 --> 02:04:54.956]  General Flynn pointed that out.
[02:04:54.996 --> 02:05:01.978]  But as late as 2015, we had General Petraeus saying, hey, let's use al-Nusra, who is part of al-Qaeda, against ISIS.
[02:05:02.098 --> 02:05:03.179]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:05:03.199 --> 02:05:04.099]  And let's understand something.
[02:05:04.339 --> 02:05:07.741]  These Islamist pigs, they put this out themselves!
[02:05:07.901 --> 02:05:08.761]  They're proud of it!
[02:05:10.302 --> 02:05:14.705]  Paul Krugman wants you to know that he is smarter than you.
[02:05:14.965 --> 02:05:21.590]  He's an American economist, distinguished professor of economics, and writer for the New York Times.
[02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:29.616]  Yesterday, Krugman posted a short article on his Twitter account, warning America about what he calls Trumponomics.
[02:05:29.936 --> 02:05:38.682]  He says to join the Trump administration, you have to be a white nationalist and, here comes the C word, a conspiracy theorist.
[02:05:39.142 --> 02:05:47.194]  Most of us living outside the Matrix know better than to take Krugman seriously because he's been wrong so many times in the past.
[02:05:47.455 --> 02:05:54.866]  It was Paul Krugman himself who predicted back in 1998 the drastically slow growth of the Internet.
[02:05:55.086 --> 02:05:57.209]  And I'm gonna quote him here.
[02:05:57.269 --> 02:06:04.060]  By 2005, it will be clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine.
[02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:09.288]  You can learn more about Paul Krugman's liberal logic right now at InfoWars.com.

[02:08:23.323 --> 02:08:30.829]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:08:31.810 --> 02:08:35.713]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:36.173 --> 02:08:39.996]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:08:40.357 --> 02:08:41.998]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:42.919 --> 02:08:50.365]  Well, the Berlin manhunt for the Islamicist who was reportedly in the truck that killed a bunch of people is ongoing, but our media says it has nothing to do with Islam.
[02:08:51.601 --> 02:08:55.064]  They're just showing an incredibly shocking video that's up at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:08:55.625 --> 02:08:57.306]  It's also up at Infowars.com.
[02:08:58.327 --> 02:09:09.498]  Breaking down a mother there in Syria with al-Nusra, that's al-Qaeda, they have the al-Qaeda flag, getting her two young daughters ready, ages five and six, for a suicide bombing.
[02:09:09.938 --> 02:09:10.938]  Kissing him goodbye.
[02:09:11.458 --> 02:09:12.619]  Little girls are so scared.
[02:09:12.639 --> 02:09:13.919]  This is so real.
[02:09:14.359 --> 02:09:16.500]  And this is what they're putting out.
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:21.901]  And man, if you watch the Oscars, or you watch the news, or you watch Netflix, it's just all over.
[02:09:22.502 --> 02:09:24.862]  The white helmets, the good people of Aleppo.
[02:09:25.502 --> 02:09:28.563]  And leftist media is like, kill that Russian ambassador in Turkey.
[02:09:28.983 --> 02:09:31.304]  My God, the good people of Aleppo!
[02:09:31.684 --> 02:09:43.688]  A bunch of jihadis that invaded Syria took over and are murdering everybody in mass, raping little girls to death, selling them into sex slavery, murdering their own daughters, and it's all cute, it's all funny, it's all trendy.
[02:09:44.948 --> 02:09:51.850]  In fact, let's take that little clip there I just pointed out and add to the bigger piece that Knight's about to put out, where we put all this in context.
[02:09:53.151 --> 02:09:53.871]  In context.
[02:09:54.571 --> 02:09:56.412]  Because it is just crazy town.
[02:09:57.762 --> 02:10:12.620]  And it's time to expose these monsters that are so anti-West, so anti-Christian, so anti-women, that they have this weird fetish to support the most radical, degenerate, viral, mutinous mutations of Islam.
[02:10:14.062 --> 02:10:15.764]  I want to hear the Muslims decry this!
[02:10:17.691 --> 02:10:20.813]  Jihad mom kisses tiny daughters, age 7 and 9.
[02:10:21.253 --> 02:10:22.374]  They look younger than that to me.
[02:10:22.714 --> 02:10:23.274]  Goodbye!
[02:10:24.135 --> 02:10:26.496]  And sends them off on suicide bomb mission.
[02:10:27.197 --> 02:10:29.558]  Add this short little clip too so I clarify what I'm saying.
[02:10:29.778 --> 02:10:31.359]  I've seen them blow up six-year-olds.
[02:10:31.379 --> 02:10:31.919]  They look like that.
[02:10:31.979 --> 02:10:36.742]  I guess they're so malnourished in the jihadi heavenly kingdom that it doesn't matter.
[02:10:38.203 --> 02:10:39.804]  I'm not somebody that talks about violence.
[02:10:39.824 --> 02:10:41.345]  I'm not somebody that shoots my mouth off.
[02:10:42.165 --> 02:10:44.767]  But let me tell you something.
[02:10:44.887 --> 02:10:46.508]  I'd love to get in a ring with that guy.
[02:10:47.631 --> 02:10:49.172]  I'd really love to get in a ring with him.
[02:10:50.374 --> 02:10:52.776]  It's not out of a hateful feeling, it's one to protect those little girls.
[02:10:54.337 --> 02:10:57.340]  I guarantee you I'd get that guy down and I'd beat his brains out.
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:04.386]  I'd imagine just punch him right in the eyes until his cheekbones break and just ram those eyes right into that brain.
[02:11:04.807 --> 02:11:07.129]  I'd punch him until my fist was a broken bloody mess.
[02:11:08.613 --> 02:11:10.034]  I don't say, I just have to say that.
[02:11:10.094 --> 02:11:12.155]  It just gives me a little bit of relief to fantasize.
[02:11:12.715 --> 02:11:13.876]  I'm not a sadistic person.
[02:11:14.456 --> 02:11:20.018]  That's a natural urge when a baby's being attacked by a monster to take that monster on.
[02:11:20.719 --> 02:11:25.121]  Whether it's a wild cat or some degenerate vampire like those children's mother and father.
[02:11:28.393 --> 02:11:30.014]  Now, I'm not doing this for an infomercial.
[02:11:30.074 --> 02:11:33.377]  I'm going to get into the Obama reportedly calling and threatening to attack Russia.
[02:11:33.417 --> 02:11:34.978]  The story's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:11:34.998 --> 02:11:37.520]  It's so important and it ties into NATO's actual statement.
[02:11:37.540 --> 02:11:39.442]  So, Steve Watson has reported it.
[02:11:39.802 --> 02:11:40.823]  We've got amazing sources.
[02:11:40.863 --> 02:11:41.824]  Be sure to check it out for yourself.
[02:11:41.844 --> 02:11:42.404]  That's coming up.
[02:11:42.424 --> 02:11:46.307]  I'll look these guys back on the nightly news at some point.
[02:11:47.128 --> 02:11:50.511]  But the reason I did this, we get sent business ideas every couple days.
[02:11:52.205 --> 02:11:59.612]  And we have to pass on most of them because usually something's already patented or it's already out there or it's not original or we don't think it's feasible and who knows what I know.
[02:12:00.032 --> 02:12:03.155]  But when I learned how young Justin
[02:12:04.753 --> 02:12:11.680]  I guess it's Godski, you can tell me, Godski if I'm pronouncing it wrong, at GetTrumpCards.com, and I'll plug where you can get them from them.
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:16.424]  We're selling them too, and of course a lot of companies wouldn't even make a Trump card.
[02:12:16.464 --> 02:12:18.166]  I was talking to them earlier, Bicycle wouldn't even make it.
[02:12:18.826 --> 02:12:22.470]  That's how controlled the economy is, so these cost them a lot to make.
[02:12:22.530 --> 02:12:27.355]  I mean, I'm getting them for like $8, $9 from them, and they cost $20, but it's got gold foil on them.
[02:12:27.775 --> 02:12:29.236]  You know, they're really fancy cards.
[02:12:30.391 --> 02:12:32.712]  And it's got Paul Watson.
[02:12:33.972 --> 02:12:41.574]  It's got myself in the InfoWarf piloting a jet aircraft with the UN and Hillary after me.
[02:12:41.974 --> 02:12:45.335]  It's got a whole bunch of Trumps, obviously, and I think he does look pretty good imperial.
[02:12:45.775 --> 02:12:46.435]  I gotta hand it to him.
[02:12:46.475 --> 02:12:47.355]  Most of the cards are Trump.
[02:12:48.936 --> 02:12:52.757]  It's got a lot of other people in there as well.
[02:12:54.102 --> 02:12:58.286]  So you definitely want to find out more about that.
[02:12:58.987 --> 02:13:16.625]  It's got Stefan Molyneux, Richard Spencer, Chuck C. Johnson, Trump, Nigel Farage, Trump's clubs, Trump of Diamonds, Milo Yiannopoulos, Katie McHugh, and a bunch of other folks there.
[02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:18.631]  So it's exciting.
[02:13:18.751 --> 02:13:19.231]  I like it.
[02:13:19.772 --> 02:13:21.973]  And again, is this going to save the world?
[02:13:22.054 --> 02:13:22.274]  No.
[02:13:22.734 --> 02:13:30.721]  But young people like this, especially putting something out, becoming entrepreneurs, little bits of culture like this, taking back the culture wars, creating art.
[02:13:31.834 --> 02:13:32.855]  Putting information out.
[02:13:33.255 --> 02:13:34.355]  Celebrating our victories.
[02:13:35.036 --> 02:13:36.176]  Some great B-roll the folks shot.
[02:13:36.196 --> 02:13:36.716]  I hadn't seen this.
[02:13:37.057 --> 02:13:37.657]  Just beautiful.
[02:13:37.937 --> 02:13:39.938]  It's got to be the prettiest card deck I've ever seen.
[02:13:40.338 --> 02:13:43.280]  Other than some hand-painted ones I've seen from the Middle Ages.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:44.961]  In a museum.
[02:13:45.361 --> 02:13:46.301]  Very, very stylish.
[02:13:46.321 --> 02:13:50.503]  They kind of go with the Middle Ages or Renaissance style of art.
[02:13:51.604 --> 02:13:52.464]  Very, very powerful.
[02:13:52.985 --> 02:13:54.646]  They're available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:13:56.189 --> 02:14:02.894]  Or you can support these guys 100% and get them again on their website that I mentioned earlier.
[02:14:03.494 --> 02:14:06.937]  But I am excited to have them join us.
[02:14:06.997 --> 02:14:08.418]  I guess, I mean, I know one of you's name.
[02:14:08.458 --> 02:14:09.698]  I guess the other's your brother.
[02:14:09.718 --> 02:14:10.399]  You sure look alike.
[02:14:10.739 --> 02:14:11.700]  Introduce yourselves.
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:12.480]  Who's who here?
[02:14:13.041 --> 02:14:14.222]  The two-headed monster is how you look.
[02:14:14.242 --> 02:14:17.384]  I mean, you look great, but kind of like a two-headed monster there from Jack and the Beanstalker.
[02:14:17.424 --> 02:14:20.426]  Was that Jack and the Beanstalker or another one there in your apartment?
[02:14:21.026 --> 02:14:22.908]  Tell us about this and introduce yourselves.
[02:14:24.209 --> 02:14:24.909]  I'm Justin.
[02:14:25.169 --> 02:14:26.530]  This is my brother Nick over here.
[02:14:27.151 --> 02:14:28.512]  We worked on the project together.
[02:14:28.992 --> 02:14:30.733]  We branded as the Kodesky Brothers.
[02:14:31.894 --> 02:14:37.418]  I had the idea and did all the logistics and website store setup and he did like most of the art.
[02:14:38.219 --> 02:14:38.859]  I did all the art.
[02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:39.620]  Yeah.
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:40.300]  So, yeah.
[02:14:44.451 --> 02:14:58.319]  Well, it's exciting, and I just want to say I saw the mock-ups you did and thought they looked pretty good, but man, with the gold foil and the way you laid these out, these look better than almost all the professional card decks I've seen out there, including fancy ones.
[02:14:58.359 --> 02:14:59.560]  So, congratulations!
[02:15:00.697 --> 02:15:00.917]  Thanks.
[02:15:01.457 --> 02:15:01.737]  Thanks.
[02:15:01.957 --> 02:15:03.098]  That's why they cost 20 bucks.
[02:15:03.578 --> 02:15:09.419]  Yeah, we're really happy with the way the foil came out, like in the metallic inks, like we have one right here.
[02:15:09.899 --> 02:15:14.701]  And yeah, we weren't sure exactly how it was going to look, but we're really happy with the way that it came out.
[02:15:16.041 --> 02:15:17.521]  Well, it's all original artwork.
[02:15:17.981 --> 02:15:19.562]  In fact, the back of the cards are great.
[02:15:19.602 --> 02:15:23.303]  Tell folks about the back of the cards as I show that to TV viewers and describe it to radio listeners.
[02:15:24.028 --> 02:15:29.853]  Yeah, like the back of the car, I based it largely off of like a traditional bicycle deck that you pick up at a store, like the normal kind of deck.
[02:15:30.553 --> 02:15:31.594]  So all designs are based on that.
[02:15:31.614 --> 02:15:32.094]  But it's Trump.
[02:15:32.174 --> 02:15:33.295]  It's Trump at the White House.
[02:15:33.856 --> 02:15:34.276]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:15:34.296 --> 02:15:34.937]  It's Trump at the White House.
[02:15:34.957 --> 02:15:37.178]  I like how you had these ready before he got in the White House, too.
[02:15:37.198 --> 02:15:39.100]  You were already having them produced before.
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:39.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:41.542]  So you were putting your money where your mouth was.
[02:15:42.363 --> 02:15:43.964]  Yeah, we actually started on this project.
[02:15:45.024 --> 02:15:50.487]  We launched our Twitter account right before the, what was it, Super Tuesday?
[02:15:50.547 --> 02:15:51.048]  Iowa caucus?
[02:15:51.088 --> 02:15:53.469]  Yeah, right before Iowa caucus.
[02:15:53.889 --> 02:15:57.431]  And just that weekend, we talked to Milo in person, because he went to a college near us.
[02:15:57.811 --> 02:16:00.813]  And that's how the entire project got started, because he agreed to be in it.
[02:16:00.933 --> 02:16:04.335]  And we got through him, we got Gavin, we got Lauren Southern, and so on.
[02:16:06.936 --> 02:16:10.158]  Well, tell me about your views and how you woke up to the New World Order.
[02:16:11.861 --> 02:16:12.442]  How did you start?
[02:16:13.682 --> 02:16:19.706]  Well, I've been involved in politics probably since I was like in late middle school, earlier than a lot of my peers.
[02:16:19.846 --> 02:16:22.048]  I was always, I grew up with a computer.
[02:16:22.748 --> 02:16:25.450]  My dad's always been a computer, so I've always been like heavily connected.
[02:16:26.150 --> 02:16:32.594]  And I just stumbled upon politics and I just was drawn to, I guess, you know, more right wing ideas.
[02:16:33.075 --> 02:16:35.056]  I've been involved for a while now.
[02:16:36.365 --> 02:16:54.559]  Yeah, we started off like, we were sort of in caps, like, you know, anarcho-capitalist, not like the lefty, you know, sort of anarchist, but like, we came through, like, Stefan Molyneux, like, people like that, and, you know, that opened our eyes to a lot of, like, potential ways of setting things up and, you know, really interested us.
[02:16:56.261 --> 02:16:58.663]  Well, and now you're here on the InfoWar.
[02:16:58.723 --> 02:16:59.964]  I wish you a lot of success.
[02:17:00.024 --> 02:17:02.686]  What other entrepreneurial ideas are you launching?
[02:17:05.095 --> 02:17:12.079]  Right now, we're actually software developers, and I'm a software developer, he's a designer, and we're designing for a startup of ours.
[02:17:12.159 --> 02:17:17.441]  It's not really related to this, but we do want to get back to more political ideas as soon as we can.
[02:17:18.241 --> 02:17:24.845]  We think there's a big cultural shift, you know, as Andrew Breitbart himself says, politics is downstream from culture.
[02:17:25.465 --> 02:17:29.587]  And that's something I think that people on the right often forget is that
[02:17:30.778 --> 02:17:36.180]  Uh, the lefties have a lot of control over art and a lot of control over culture.
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:38.321]  It's completely artificial.
[02:17:38.341 --> 02:17:39.401]  There's no reason for that.
[02:17:39.421 --> 02:17:41.061]  Divide is completely artificial.
[02:17:41.081 --> 02:17:43.842]  Divide is because this is basically just the politics of it.
[02:17:43.982 --> 02:17:44.843]  And, uh, yeah.
[02:17:44.863 --> 02:17:52.485]  And like how, like everything is from Hollywood and how, uh, how there's control there over like what, what you're allowed to show, what you're like, you know, what messages you're allowed to send.
[02:17:52.905 --> 02:17:54.226]  But, uh, there's no reason for that.
[02:17:54.306 --> 02:17:58.227]  I think it would be nice if we saw a revival of, uh, of like right wing art.
[02:17:59.994 --> 02:18:00.434]  That's right.
[02:18:00.474 --> 02:18:01.495]  And what's the best website?
[02:18:01.555 --> 02:18:02.916]  GetTrump.cards?
[02:18:03.597 --> 02:18:04.197]  Yeah, correct.
[02:18:04.798 --> 02:18:05.318]  Alright.
[02:18:05.739 --> 02:18:06.860]  GetTrump.cards.
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:10.343]  Now I know Trump's famous about defending his image and things like that.
[02:18:10.443 --> 02:18:13.785]  I even hesitated putting out Trump as my president, but he's a public figure.
[02:18:13.805 --> 02:18:14.566]  We have a right to do it.
[02:18:14.866 --> 02:18:16.828]  I know he's aware of what I've done and hasn't had a problem with it.
[02:18:17.088 --> 02:18:22.372]  I know he's had a problem with other people putting out Trump decks that basically demonized him, but I think you've got fair use here.
[02:18:22.793 --> 02:18:25.355]  It's a deck of activists, including the president.
[02:18:25.375 --> 02:18:26.216]  He's a public figure.
[02:18:26.236 --> 02:18:28.057]  You've got the permission of the other activists.
[02:18:28.077 --> 02:18:28.858]  I think you're completely
[02:18:29.278 --> 02:18:30.580]  Covered here, but who knows?
[02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:31.462]  This is historical.
[02:18:31.922 --> 02:18:33.244]  Everybody should get it.
[02:18:33.264 --> 02:18:36.169]  You also have an art gallery, which I want to get some of this and hang it up.
[02:18:36.570 --> 02:18:38.393]  I like the fact that I'm the Ace of Diamonds.
[02:18:39.094 --> 02:18:40.776]  Is Gavin McGinnis the Ace of Spades?
[02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:42.441]  Yeah, he's the Ace of Spades, yeah.
[02:18:42.681 --> 02:18:48.647]  He personally recommended for him to be the Ace of Spades, because he has a tattoo on his arm that, you know, references that song.
[02:18:48.687 --> 02:18:52.631]  He recommended, which is fine, but Trump should be the Ace of Spades in this deck.
[02:18:52.971 --> 02:18:54.413]  I mean, I don't have a problem with Gavin.
[02:18:54.473 --> 02:18:55.234]  He's just so funny.
[02:18:55.654 --> 02:19:00.459]  I recommend, boys, that you make me the Ace of Spades, because I have a tattoo of it.
[02:19:00.919 --> 02:19:03.081]  I mean, I love Gavin, but it should be Trump.
[02:19:03.341 --> 02:19:03.942]  He deserves it.
[02:19:04.102 --> 02:19:04.663]  I like Gavin, too.
[02:19:05.163 --> 02:19:05.724]  Yeah, he does.
[02:19:05.744 --> 02:19:07.185]  But I mean, Trump is the Ace of Spades.
[02:19:07.205 --> 02:19:09.467]  In fact, don't we, we've been saying that for a year and a half.
[02:19:09.828 --> 02:19:11.029]  Trump is the Ace of Spades.
[02:19:11.869 --> 02:19:12.910]  Let's put him up on screen.
[02:19:13.751 --> 02:19:16.474]  But I'm going to imagine you're going to have more permutations, aren't you?
[02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:28.503]  Well, we thought about it, but one of the things with the printing is whenever you send in the final art, it's kind of locked in, because they create a plate, and then they press the plate down on the sheet.
[02:19:28.803 --> 02:19:36.646]  So any changes that we would want to make to the deck would be a lot more costly than just sending another print through, because of the way it works as a setup.
[02:19:37.492 --> 02:19:38.473]  No, I'm impressed.
[02:19:38.553 --> 02:19:40.254]  I want to have you guys back on.
[02:19:40.534 --> 02:19:43.335]  And like I said, send me some of the posters you've got as well.
[02:19:43.415 --> 02:19:45.116]  Very, very honored to be the Ace of Diamonds.
[02:19:45.697 --> 02:19:47.278]  And I appreciate your work, gentlemen.
[02:19:48.038 --> 02:19:49.799]  Again, GetTrump.Cards.
[02:19:49.819 --> 02:19:51.920]  I didn't know they had a card URL.
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:52.360]  That's cool.
[02:19:52.380 --> 02:19:53.381]  Oh yeah, that's relatively new.
[02:19:54.141 --> 02:19:55.902]  I think I need an InfoWars card right now, folks.
[02:19:55.922 --> 02:19:56.243]  Let's get it.
[02:19:56.263 --> 02:19:57.463]  Chris might have already grabbed it.
[02:19:57.483 --> 02:19:58.584]  I can take it away, though, folks.
[02:19:59.184 --> 02:20:00.465]  Listen, I appreciate you guys.
[02:20:00.505 --> 02:20:00.925]  Great job.
[02:20:00.945 --> 02:20:01.906]  We also have the cards available.
[02:20:02.186 --> 02:20:03.187]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:20:03.227 --> 02:20:04.367]  Have a great Christmas, my friends.
[02:20:04.387 --> 02:20:04.847]  All right, thanks.
[02:20:04.867 --> 02:20:05.108]  You too.
[02:20:05.908 --> 02:20:07.309]  And we'll have you back up, alright?
[02:20:07.829 --> 02:20:09.691]  I want the posters, that's what looks cool, great art.
[02:20:12.172 --> 02:20:23.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for President of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again!
[02:20:26.041 --> 02:20:29.444]  They see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump.
[02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:32.381]  The career politicians beat Trump.
[02:20:32.822 --> 02:20:37.385]  It's just awfully good that Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[02:20:39.226 --> 02:20:40.227]  Because you'd be in jail.
[02:20:41.248 --> 02:20:46.952]  Trump's election is going to be the biggest f*** you ever recorded in human history.
[02:20:47.492 --> 02:20:49.814]  You think your business background helps you with campaigning?
[02:20:49.834 --> 02:20:51.395]  I was doing the primaries.
[02:20:51.956 --> 02:20:54.938]  I spent less money than other people and I did better.
[02:20:55.578 --> 02:20:56.979]  And that's what we want to do for the country.
[02:20:56.999 --> 02:20:58.961]  We want to spend less money and do better.
[02:21:00.123 --> 02:21:07.086]  I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.
[02:21:07.326 --> 02:21:08.767]  Hi, this is Ted Cruz calling.
[02:21:19.612 --> 02:21:24.874]  Death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.
[02:21:25.415 --> 02:21:28.316]  This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton.
[02:21:30.140 --> 02:21:32.641]  Now, the two faces of Hillary Clinton are coming out.
[02:21:32.661 --> 02:21:38.984]  The fact, through WikiLeaks, that she says one thing and... Oh, no.
[02:21:39.004 --> 02:21:41.205]  Alright, let's see if we can get Congressman Collins back.
[02:21:41.265 --> 02:21:45.987]  Obviously, we just lost the satellite feed.
[02:21:46.027 --> 02:21:47.428]  I think the media is very dishonest.
[02:21:47.468 --> 02:21:48.328]  I say it all the time.
[02:21:48.488 --> 02:21:51.890]  I think they're among the most dishonest human beings I've ever met.
[02:22:07.247 --> 02:22:21.752]  Remember, Hillary Clinton has some vulnerabilities herself because of her support in the 1990s for anti-crime legislation that ultimately helped contribute to this era of mass incarceration that she now speaks out again.
[02:22:23.712 --> 02:22:25.553]  We just lost, we just lost Breonna Keillor.
[02:22:34.430 --> 02:22:35.510]  I will be the nominee.
[02:22:35.550 --> 02:22:37.571]  There is no way that I won't be.
[02:22:38.492 --> 02:22:47.197]  Is it acceptable that Wall Street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections?
[02:22:47.737 --> 02:22:48.938]  Is that democracy?
[02:23:05.729 --> 02:23:07.510]  History is watching us now.
[02:23:08.270 --> 02:23:11.632]  It's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion.
[02:23:11.972 --> 02:23:12.832]  Just win, baby.
[02:23:13.132 --> 02:23:20.036]  And if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.
[02:23:21.136 --> 02:23:21.917]  I am with you.
[02:23:23.237 --> 02:23:24.258]  I will fight for you.
[02:23:25.118 --> 02:23:26.859]  And I will win for you.
[02:23:26.879 --> 02:23:31.081]  I am your voice.
[02:23:40.558 --> 02:23:43.239]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[02:23:43.459 --> 02:23:46.500]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[02:23:46.861 --> 02:23:47.601]  Because it's already here.
[02:23:47.981 --> 02:23:48.641]  It's being announced.
[02:23:49.002 --> 02:23:52.463]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[02:23:52.883 --> 02:23:54.844]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:23:54.924 --> 02:23:56.485]  A new battleship in the fight.
[02:23:56.665 --> 02:23:57.685]  InfoWars Live.
[02:23:57.865 --> 02:23:58.685]  Available right now.
[02:23:58.966 --> 02:24:00.726]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[02:24:00.746 --> 02:24:03.147]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[02:24:03.167 --> 02:24:04.768]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[02:24:05.328 --> 02:24:08.329]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[02:24:08.830 --> 02:24:09.390]  Take action!
[02:24:37.173 --> 02:24:53.241]  I was late getting in here because it just came off the 18-wheeler yesterday.
[02:24:54.081 --> 02:24:54.802]  Two new t-shirts.
[02:24:55.422 --> 02:24:57.203]  People keep asking for an Infowars crew shirt.
[02:24:58.254 --> 02:25:00.075]  And we've got one for the crew and one for everybody.
[02:25:00.095 --> 02:25:02.517]  It just says InfoWars.com on the back with a big symbol.
[02:25:02.977 --> 02:25:06.199]  InfoWars.com on the right hand shoulder and it says crew on the breast.
[02:25:06.619 --> 02:25:10.801]  We also have the Republic Defense Force that says press on it as well.
[02:25:11.782 --> 02:25:19.346]  It's an InfoWars, so very exciting to be seen, to meet like-minded people, to come together at events, and to support the InfoWars.
[02:25:19.846 --> 02:25:22.248]  The two new shirts are available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:25:22.668 --> 02:25:25.250]  Now, going back to the serious news.
[02:25:25.310 --> 02:25:28.572]  We've got the crew in the TV studio.
[02:25:28.592 --> 02:25:32.054]  We're here in the radio slash news studio, the war room.
[02:25:32.995 --> 02:25:35.396]  Massive cyber attack could trigger NATO response.
[02:25:35.456 --> 02:25:38.198]  This is from Reuters a month ago.
[02:25:38.879 --> 02:25:40.520]  We have Hillary also saying it.
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:43.922]  And then now we have this report from Infowars.com.
[02:25:45.243 --> 02:25:49.726]  Obama threatened Putin with war over election hacking conspiracy theory.
[02:25:50.991 --> 02:25:54.013]  And of course, Putin said he got a call last week from Obama.
[02:25:54.073 --> 02:25:55.234]  Obama says he gave him a call.
[02:25:55.314 --> 02:25:59.817]  President used emergency red phone system to say, quote, armed conflict could ensue.
[02:26:00.538 --> 02:26:03.380]  Now, he goes through NBC reporting this and others.
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:04.541]  This is just incredible.
[02:26:04.841 --> 02:26:08.083]  But what's even more amazing is this is now official policy.
[02:26:08.723 --> 02:26:11.285]  So you've got the president basically threatening World War Three.
[02:26:11.305 --> 02:26:12.046]  That's where this goes.
[02:26:13.692 --> 02:26:18.855]  Off of some CIA report Congress can't see, the head of all intelligence, Clapper says it's fake.
[02:26:19.296 --> 02:26:21.977]  I've got CIA sources that are high up and others do as well.
[02:26:22.558 --> 02:26:23.218]  This is bull.
[02:26:23.258 --> 02:26:25.940]  We told you a week before they admit it was bull, it was bull.
[02:26:26.420 --> 02:26:28.181]  We told you the exact type of bull it was.
[02:26:28.202 --> 02:26:32.344]  Just like we told you Romney wasn't going to get it when they first announced it.
[02:26:32.905 --> 02:26:35.726]  I don't know who we're talking to that would know these things.
[02:26:37.578 --> 02:26:39.259]  I can't believe I'm in the Twilight Zone.
[02:26:39.459 --> 02:26:40.400]  This might be the Matrix.
[02:26:40.580 --> 02:26:41.441]  This is just too cool.
[02:26:41.641 --> 02:26:42.822]  I'm sitting here with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:26:43.122 --> 02:26:44.963]  I'm looking at the Christmas tree here in Austin, Texas.
[02:26:45.223 --> 02:26:46.864]  We've built this operation to crush the enemy.
[02:26:47.064 --> 02:26:48.065]  We're just winning and winning.
[02:26:48.265 --> 02:26:49.746]  There's total exuberance.
[02:26:49.966 --> 02:26:56.050]  The highest Gallup poll in a hundred year history, in history, for exuberance and confidence in the economy.
[02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:59.032]  Just winning, winning, winning, winning Leanne.
[02:26:59.372 --> 02:27:00.313]  What is going on here?
[02:27:00.533 --> 02:27:03.515]  And now Obama wants to turn it all over and have a nuclear war.
[02:27:03.715 --> 02:27:04.956]  But it's okay because he's liberal.
[02:27:05.216 --> 02:27:06.097]  Sore losers.
[02:27:06.757 --> 02:27:07.258]  I don't know.
[02:27:07.358 --> 02:27:09.279]  Donald Trump said, I'm not going to get tired of winning.
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:10.801]  Winning feels great.
[02:27:10.821 --> 02:27:19.228]  What do you think about the fact that the sore losers are now saying that no matter how deranged we have to get, we must do everything we can to delegitimize Trump?
[02:27:19.728 --> 02:27:24.972]  Just why don't you do a little soul searching, step back, figure out what you did to lose so badly.
[02:27:24.992 --> 02:27:27.895]  This is why we're probably going to have eight years of Trump.
[02:27:27.915 --> 02:27:28.896]  I agree.
[02:27:28.996 --> 02:27:29.976]  And what do you think of
[02:27:31.834 --> 02:27:45.681]  What do you think of, have you seen the clip, because I know you're getting ready for the news, where I play where she's on Oprah, the first tranny is on there, Michelle Obama, and she's, that's what Joan Rivers was friends with her and said she's a tranny and then they killed her a week later, probably, probably killed her.
[02:27:46.481 --> 02:27:48.983]  But seriously, the major media keeps saying I first said that, no, Joan Rivers did.
[02:27:49.303 --> 02:27:51.324]  What do you make of her saying we're all just dumb toddlers?
[02:27:52.125 --> 02:27:58.388]  You know, I haven't watched her interview yet because it just, it made me sick to my stomach, just the highlights that were coming out.
[02:27:58.428 --> 02:28:03.270]  Her saying, oh well, we brought hope into the White House and now that we're leaving, there is no hope.
[02:28:03.710 --> 02:28:04.910]  Please, are you kidding me?
[02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:05.771]  Where is the hope?
[02:28:05.831 --> 02:28:07.451]  The country is in dire straits.
[02:28:07.812 --> 02:28:17.736]  Take a look around at the globe and basically you're insulting more than half the country that wanted to make America great again and got Trump in office.
[02:28:18.716 --> 02:28:19.217]  We are.
[02:28:19.337 --> 02:28:22.500]  We are filled with hope for the first time in quite a long time.
[02:28:22.540 --> 02:28:23.380]  A lot of people are.
[02:28:23.461 --> 02:28:27.304]  So, you know, to me... Because the globalists have been trying to demoralize us so we give up.
[02:28:27.945 --> 02:28:28.305]  Right.
[02:28:28.345 --> 02:28:30.187]  It's even in the WikiLeaks where they want to demoralize us.
[02:28:30.207 --> 02:28:32.068]  These people are so creepy.
[02:28:32.269 --> 02:28:33.810]  It's everything is opposite.
[02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:34.651]  It's the double speak.
[02:28:35.071 --> 02:28:35.311]  You know?
[02:28:35.331 --> 02:28:36.291]  Let me ask you a serious question.
[02:28:36.311 --> 02:28:37.151]  We have hope, but there's no hope.
[02:28:37.171 --> 02:28:39.212]  We've seen the photos of her in the dresses with the big bulge.
[02:28:39.872 --> 02:28:40.992]  With, you know, the anaconda.
[02:28:41.692 --> 02:28:42.853]  I mean, I'm being serious here.
[02:28:42.893 --> 02:28:44.213]  Do you think she really could be a man?
[02:28:44.433 --> 02:28:46.313]  Because he admits he was raised by a tranny in Indonesia.
[02:28:46.573 --> 02:28:47.534]  There's all this weird stuff.
[02:28:47.574 --> 02:28:49.614]  Why do you think Joe Romero said she's a tranny and then died?
[02:28:50.654 --> 02:28:52.775]  I do not believe Michelle Obama has a codpiece.
[02:28:53.975 --> 02:28:54.575]  I don't believe it.
[02:28:54.695 --> 02:28:55.955]  So then what is the giant bulge?
[02:28:56.215 --> 02:28:57.176]  I think it's fake news.
[02:28:58.276 --> 02:28:58.696]  I don't know.
[02:28:58.736 --> 02:29:01.216]  Maybe she has incontinence or something.
[02:29:01.296 --> 02:29:01.716]  I don't know.
[02:29:02.237 --> 02:29:02.357]  Ah!
[02:29:03.477 --> 02:29:03.897]  A diaper!
[02:29:11.015 --> 02:29:11.635]  I'm unsure.
[02:29:12.836 --> 02:29:13.196]  I am.
[02:29:13.396 --> 02:29:14.897]  I am trolling the MSM.
[02:29:14.977 --> 02:29:16.238]  You understand that?
[02:29:16.558 --> 02:29:23.382]  I want the big story over Christmas to be Alex Jones, the fake news guy, says she, you know, says she's Long John Silver.
[02:29:23.522 --> 02:29:27.464]  Family show.
[02:29:27.484 --> 02:29:29.205]  Family show.
[02:29:29.245 --> 02:29:29.405]  What?
[02:29:29.425 --> 02:29:31.246]  I'm talking about Long John Silver.
[02:29:31.426 --> 02:29:32.547]  Never seen that story?
[02:29:32.607 --> 02:29:33.167]  Treasure Island?
[02:29:34.448 --> 02:29:35.188]  You ever seen that movie?
[02:29:35.728 --> 02:29:36.569]  I'm gonna stop.
[02:29:36.749 --> 02:29:37.269]  I'm gonna stop.
[02:29:37.669 --> 02:29:38.229]  I'm trolling media.
[02:29:38.269 --> 02:29:38.730]  I apologize.
[02:29:38.770 --> 02:29:39.270]  Lord, I repent.
[02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:40.030]  I'm sorry.
[02:29:40.050 --> 02:29:40.410]  I'm sorry.
[02:29:40.430 --> 02:29:42.611]  They're gonna take everything out of context.
[02:29:42.631 --> 02:29:43.091]  I'm sorry.
[02:29:43.331 --> 02:29:43.631]  I'm sorry.
[02:29:43.811 --> 02:29:44.372]  I'm sorry.
[02:29:44.692 --> 02:29:47.533]  I can't wait to get to this actual fake news topic.
[02:29:47.913 --> 02:29:49.193]  That was satire media.
[02:29:50.274 --> 02:29:50.994]  That was satire.
[02:29:52.094 --> 02:29:53.995]  So you don't think Michelle Obama has a codpiece?
[02:29:54.699 --> 02:29:56.520]  No, she just looks like a man like Rachel Maddow.
[02:29:56.560 --> 02:29:58.362]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:29:58.442 --> 02:29:59.482]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[02:29:59.643 --> 02:30:01.084]  She says we're toddlers!
[02:30:01.744 --> 02:30:04.566]  Okay, well I can say, Mommy, that looks like a man!
[02:30:04.586 --> 02:30:07.808]  Look, Mommy, it has a wee-wee!
[02:30:10.510 --> 02:30:12.291]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[02:30:13.993 --> 02:30:19.657]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[02:30:20.357 --> 02:30:24.240]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[02:30:25.177 --> 02:30:27.418]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[02:30:27.498 --> 02:30:28.658]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[02:30:28.678 --> 02:30:31.880]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[02:30:32.860 --> 02:30:33.200]  Or more.
[02:30:33.300 --> 02:30:35.241]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[02:30:35.721 --> 02:30:37.202]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[02:30:38.422 --> 02:30:40.663]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[02:30:40.763 --> 02:30:42.524]  It's actually scary.
[02:30:43.408 --> 02:30:53.493]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[02:30:54.494 --> 02:31:07.301]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.

[02:32:09.807 --> 02:32:20.780]  As reported by the Daily Mail, yet another Russian diplomat is found dead, this one at his home in Moscow just hours after the reports came of the assassination of the Russian ambassador in Ankara, Turkey.
[02:32:20.921 --> 02:32:25.466]  Peter Polshchukov, 56 years old, he was found dead from a gunshot wound in his own home.
[02:32:25.586 --> 02:32:29.531]  He's reported to be a senior figure in Russia for the Latin American Department of
[02:32:29.531 --> 02:32:29.851]  I don't know.
[02:32:48.629 --> 02:32:52.410]  But what we do know is that police are examining all possible motives to his death.
[02:32:52.490 --> 02:33:00.811]  Two empty bullet wounds were found in the apartment in Bilovsky Prospect, and a gun was discovered under the sink in the bathroom, as reported by Ren TV.
[02:33:00.871 --> 02:33:06.352]  Your latest update on the second assassination of a Russian diplomat in a spate of 48 hours.
[02:33:06.372 --> 02:33:08.973]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:33:20.470 --> 02:33:24.554]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:25.335 --> 02:33:26.897]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:33:47.142 --> 02:33:50.544]  I was just telling Leigh-Anne, and she's a big Van Halen fan too, we went to one of the same concerts.
[02:33:50.624 --> 02:33:51.424]  I've got girl kids.
[02:33:52.084 --> 02:33:53.925]  I saw the shirt and said, that's vintage, sweetheart.
[02:33:54.726 --> 02:33:57.227]  And she said, she said, well, I got this back when I was a kid, though.
[02:33:57.247 --> 02:33:58.507]  That was when you were a teenager.
[02:33:58.727 --> 02:34:00.228]  And this one with the big eagle screaming in.
[02:34:00.888 --> 02:34:02.529]  Like, black arms, white front.
[02:34:03.089 --> 02:34:05.971]  I used to go to the big Monsters of Rock at the Cotton Bowl.
[02:34:06.771 --> 02:34:09.992]  And it would start, like, after they'd been going like 10 hours at night, about 8 o'clock at night.
[02:34:10.493 --> 02:34:13.514]  That's why Sammy Hagar always talks about, you know, it's 8 o'clock, it's time to go.
[02:34:14.094 --> 02:34:14.975]  In one of his songs.
[02:34:15.815 --> 02:34:17.757]  And just like for 10 minutes with the lights off.
[02:34:17.797 --> 02:34:19.678]  You know the drums?
[02:34:20.319 --> 02:34:20.759]  Good stuff.
[02:34:25.963 --> 02:34:28.945]  I love this Christmas spirit in this room here.
[02:34:30.066 --> 02:34:31.747]  Have you already shown what that is over there?
[02:34:31.787 --> 02:34:32.308]  I don't know.
[02:34:32.568 --> 02:34:35.030]  This is what listeners send us and no one gave me a note.
[02:34:35.470 --> 02:34:39.213]  I just walk in here and there's like some UN global government toy soldier.
[02:34:39.838 --> 02:34:40.419]  Nutcracker.
[02:34:40.679 --> 02:34:41.380]  Nutcracker.
[02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:45.203]  I mean, I thought it was like... Let me see it.
[02:34:46.164 --> 02:34:47.285]  There you go.
[02:34:47.325 --> 02:34:48.446]  Alright, let's get serious.
[02:34:48.687 --> 02:34:52.090]  We've got callers Dawn and Chris and Joe and Chris and Ben.
[02:34:52.470 --> 02:34:55.433]  I'm gonna get to all of you coming up in the fourth hour.
[02:34:56.536 --> 02:34:58.699]  Who is hosting the fourth hour today, hmm?
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:00.241]  Roger Stone!
[02:35:00.281 --> 02:35:02.443]  Oh my gosh, it's Wednesday, of course, Roger Stone.
[02:35:03.184 --> 02:35:04.126]  So he's gotten better.
[02:35:04.146 --> 02:35:04.987]  He was food poisoned.
[02:35:05.007 --> 02:35:05.888]  I wonder if he was actually poisoned.
[02:35:06.689 --> 02:35:07.390]  I've been poisoned before.
[02:35:07.410 --> 02:35:09.753]  I haven't really told people about that, but I've done it a couple times.
[02:35:09.773 --> 02:35:10.413]  It's not too fun.
[02:35:11.054 --> 02:35:13.517]  Let's just say I don't drink things people give me at public events anymore.
[02:35:15.345 --> 02:35:16.927]  Or if somebody's wearing gloves, don't let them touch you.
[02:35:16.947 --> 02:35:18.008]  I'm serious, this is stuff we do.
[02:35:18.028 --> 02:35:19.309]  They're usually just really to make you sick.
[02:35:19.329 --> 02:35:20.410]  Bump into you on the street.
[02:35:20.430 --> 02:35:21.351]  That's what they do, yeah.
[02:35:21.531 --> 02:35:23.172]  End up dead in the bathroom a few hours later.
[02:35:23.192 --> 02:35:24.554]  They're like, oh, Alex, you're not that important.
[02:35:24.614 --> 02:35:25.294]  Oh, yeah, right.
[02:35:25.655 --> 02:35:28.477]  I'm not saying I'm that important, but let me tell you, we're in the middle of some crazy stuff.
[02:35:28.877 --> 02:35:30.159]  What's up, dude?
[02:35:30.279 --> 02:35:30.519]  Okay.
[02:35:30.539 --> 02:35:33.141]  We started screwing around and now Dew brought in the real nutcracker.
[02:35:33.161 --> 02:35:33.802]  The real nutcracker.
[02:35:33.842 --> 02:35:35.544]  Remember the company that had this nutcracker?
[02:35:37.265 --> 02:35:37.966]  Hillary Clinton.
[02:35:39.744 --> 02:35:40.565]  It doesn't talk anymore.
[02:35:40.605 --> 02:35:41.947]  Well, she coughs.
[02:35:41.967 --> 02:35:44.069]  She doesn't talk.
[02:35:44.109 --> 02:35:45.310]  The new Nutcracker coughs.
[02:35:45.551 --> 02:35:47.373]  All right, let's get serious.
[02:35:47.693 --> 02:35:49.195]  I wanted to roundtable this today.
[02:35:49.235 --> 02:35:52.138]  Well, one of the top topics we've got here, everyone.
[02:35:52.198 --> 02:35:56.643]  Yes, well, I wanted to hear from you how you would dub this year, what you're concerned about.
[02:35:56.683 --> 02:35:58.205]  Will Trump get into the next 29 days?
[02:35:58.265 --> 02:35:58.805]  What do you make of
[02:35:59.426 --> 02:36:02.670]  Gallup saying the most exuberance and confidence ever recorded.
[02:36:03.551 --> 02:36:05.734]  The Global is trying to raise interest rates to plunge all that.
[02:36:06.234 --> 02:36:07.396]  What's going to happen next year?
[02:36:07.456 --> 02:36:09.939]  Just in brevity, you know, the big topics.
[02:36:10.139 --> 02:36:13.343]  And of course, we've got the rest of the crew in there as well.
[02:36:13.663 --> 02:36:14.985]  Introduce who we've got in the other crew in there.
[02:36:15.814 --> 02:36:22.957]  Well, we have Ashley Beckford and Owen Schroyer joining us from the Nightly News, you know, backup studio there.
[02:36:22.977 --> 02:36:25.818]  We need to give ourselves names in the studio, because we're like, what do we call that thing?
[02:36:26.219 --> 02:36:30.701]  It's the Nightly News studio, this is the War Room, and that's the radio studio.
[02:36:30.801 --> 02:36:30.961]  Yes.
[02:36:30.981 --> 02:36:31.601]  Studio Alpha.
[02:36:33.162 --> 02:36:33.862]  Studio Alpha.
[02:36:33.922 --> 02:36:36.503]  You guys are in Studio Alpha, we're in Studio Bravo.
[02:36:37.044 --> 02:36:38.784]  That's right, Alpha Bravo.
[02:36:39.084 --> 02:36:39.785]  Alpha Bravo.
[02:36:39.825 --> 02:36:40.265]  Tango.
[02:36:40.865 --> 02:36:41.486]  I like it.
[02:36:41.646 --> 02:36:42.966]  Tango's the radio studio.
[02:36:43.246 --> 02:36:44.487]  They've officially been named.
[02:36:45.487 --> 02:36:46.928]  Alpha, Bravo, Tango.
[02:36:47.148 --> 02:36:47.549]  I like it.
[02:36:48.429 --> 02:36:51.012]  Alpha Studio, Bravo Studio, Tango Studio.
[02:36:51.412 --> 02:36:53.394]  Seriously though, who wants to go first?
[02:36:53.414 --> 02:36:56.076]  What do you think the biggest event of this year is going to be so far?
[02:36:57.008 --> 02:37:00.231]  Well, I would just like to say, Alex, I'm glad to see you loosened up today.
[02:37:00.271 --> 02:37:02.794]  You've been working so hard lately and you've been so tight.
[02:37:02.854 --> 02:37:06.397]  It's nice to see you with a smile on your face today and having a good time.
[02:37:06.457 --> 02:37:07.258]  So I just want to say that.
[02:37:07.899 --> 02:37:11.902]  But, you know, you were talking about fake news and trolling the mainstream media, Alex.
[02:37:12.323 --> 02:37:15.966]  I'm not sure if you're aware of the biggest troll ever on Twitter, perhaps, today.
[02:37:16.787 --> 02:37:19.068]  Hashtag Boycott Delta.
[02:37:19.528 --> 02:37:28.091]  This guy Adam Saleh gets kicked off of a Delta flight and claims it's due to racism because he was speaking Arabic on the plane.
[02:37:28.431 --> 02:37:33.053]  This hashtag has been the number one hashtag showing up on Twitter on my account all day long.
[02:37:33.593 --> 02:37:36.734]  This guy is a YouTube prankster.
[02:37:37.115 --> 02:37:41.316]  He has multiple videos on his YouTube page with millions of views.
[02:37:41.616 --> 02:37:43.117]  He's got over 2 million subscribers.
[02:37:43.877 --> 02:37:52.062]  Where he goes on flights and pranks people on the flights with a towel on his head, a turban, counting down from 10 in Arabic.
[02:37:52.142 --> 02:38:01.367]  Which the kid did at the school with the clock counting down, looks like a bomb, the cops say tell us what it is, for 30 minutes he won't, so they arrest him.
[02:38:01.627 --> 02:38:02.308]  What the hell?
[02:38:02.808 --> 02:38:08.169]  He's got what looks like a bomb counting down, you won't say what it is, and then they turn it into he's a victim.
[02:38:08.350 --> 02:38:11.130]  Turns out his dad's a big globalist Islamist stunner.
[02:38:11.370 --> 02:38:14.811]  And all these women come out later and admit, nobody attacked me because I'm Islamic.
[02:38:15.051 --> 02:38:18.672]  No, it's the Islamic folks getting their little daughters ready to suicide bomb.
[02:38:18.832 --> 02:38:19.913]  Did you see that footage earlier?
[02:38:22.293 --> 02:38:24.254]  The woman who sent her daughter in and said goodbye?
[02:38:24.274 --> 02:38:24.554]  Yeah.
[02:38:25.478 --> 02:38:27.339]  Yeah, that was really sick.
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:43.091]  Well, and I think just kind of, you know, getting to the story, it is going to be these race hoax, uh, race crime hoaxes, as well as the fake news, because this story that Owen brings up, it was like the number one trending thing and the mainstream media just went with it immediately.
[02:38:43.111 --> 02:38:47.635]  Oh, we have another Delta kicks this guy off the plane for speaking Arabic loudly.
[02:38:47.695 --> 02:38:49.096]  We have a race crime here.
[02:38:49.636 --> 02:38:51.417]  Don't even do any fact checking on it.
[02:38:51.758 --> 02:38:53.339]  Totally just fake news in it.
[02:38:53.439 --> 02:38:57.621]  How about everybody has their larynx removed, that way no one can say, Durka Durka Muhammad Jihad.
[02:38:58.241 --> 02:39:00.001]  Well, I mean, the thing is... I like you.
[02:39:00.101 --> 02:39:01.302]  This is fake news in action.
[02:39:01.322 --> 02:39:02.002]  You have big balls.
[02:39:02.302 --> 02:39:08.504]  Is that if someone reports a hate crime, if they're a victim of a hate crime, they're Muslim, they just run with it.
[02:39:08.544 --> 02:39:10.285]  They don't even do any fact checking.
[02:39:10.545 --> 02:39:17.128]  Meanwhile, almost immediately, people are pointing out, this is a YouTube star who is known for making these viral videos.
[02:39:18.368 --> 02:39:18.988]  Look at this guy.
[02:39:19.048 --> 02:39:21.510]  He does like fake anti-Muslim racial programs.
[02:39:21.530 --> 02:39:37.939]  Yeah, he goes on like, HALA MAHALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HALA HAL
[02:39:38.619 --> 02:39:52.447]  Yes, I was going to just agree with Leanne and just point out that it is really crazy that the mainstream media knows that this guy is a YouTube prankster, and they're not even going to point out that fact and realize, hmm, maybe we should do a little investigation on this.
[02:39:52.687 --> 02:39:54.168]  You know, I saw this this morning, too.
[02:39:54.208 --> 02:39:55.389]  He's a comedian and an actor.
[02:39:55.629 --> 02:39:57.391]  And at first they were saying it was real and earlier I was looking.
[02:39:57.431 --> 02:40:02.035]  So what you're saying, Ashley, is they're still running with it even though it's fraudulent?
[02:40:02.256 --> 02:40:02.416]  Right.
[02:40:02.916 --> 02:40:03.357]  Exactly.
[02:40:03.437 --> 02:40:07.401]  Yeah, that's the biggest trend, like Leanne was saying, of this year is the fake news.
[02:40:07.781 --> 02:40:10.664]  Basically, this is the death knell of the mainstream media.
[02:40:10.704 --> 02:40:17.451]  People are realizing they really can create their own platforms, they can go out there, they can get the real news, they can create the real news.
[02:40:17.831 --> 02:40:20.814]  Just by reporting on what's going on in their local area.
[02:40:21.195 --> 02:40:25.760]  And this is one of the ways that we've seen today where people have pointed out, hey, this is a YouTuber.
[02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:26.881]  This is a prankster.
[02:40:26.901 --> 02:40:31.806]  Why is this being, you know, reported as mainstream media news as if it's something real?
[02:40:32.006 --> 02:40:36.171]  So they've really been caught in giant fake news because they know he's fake.
[02:40:36.491 --> 02:40:42.054]  But they're still going with it, spinning it around like Muslims are the victims when they're the ones blowing the planes up.
[02:40:42.394 --> 02:40:46.156]  And again, intimidating other Muslims that aren't extreme.
[02:40:46.396 --> 02:40:51.698]  We're supporting the good Muslims by trying to go after the really radical ones that have taken over Islam.
[02:40:51.718 --> 02:40:55.820]  And I was watching the video when you guys were playing a clip, and I saw some earlier today.
[02:40:56.221 --> 02:40:58.882]  The plane is Hispanics, blacks, white people, you name it.
[02:40:59.122 --> 02:41:02.384]  Folks that look like they're Muslims, too, are getting up in concern.
[02:41:02.444 --> 02:41:03.244]  This isn't racial.
[02:41:03.564 --> 02:41:07.907]  This is a guy speaking in Arabic, counting down from 10, acting weird.
[02:41:08.007 --> 02:41:15.273]  At a time of heightened terrorism in this country, you shouldn't be trying to make a viral YouTube video that you know is going to be making people uncomfortable.
[02:41:15.613 --> 02:41:16.114]  Period.
[02:41:16.414 --> 02:41:23.199]  And Owen actually has some of his other videos where you can see the type of viral videos that he does.
[02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:26.441]  We should do a report on him right now.
[02:41:26.461 --> 02:41:27.421]  Can we pull up his channel?
[02:41:28.021 --> 02:41:28.581]  Owen, what is it?
[02:41:29.121 --> 02:41:31.242]  It's Adam Saleh Vlogs.
[02:41:31.662 --> 02:41:33.582]  Adam Saleh Vlogs.
[02:41:33.762 --> 02:41:38.924]  And he's got thousands of the... I mean, he's literally a YouTube prankster.
[02:41:39.084 --> 02:41:40.424]  Like, that's what he does.
[02:41:40.484 --> 02:41:41.945]  He pranks people on YouTube.
[02:41:41.965 --> 02:41:46.186]  And by the way, what NPR will do is they'll have someone like him on and say, I'm fake like Alex.
[02:41:46.206 --> 02:41:46.986]  And this is how we do it.
[02:41:47.546 --> 02:41:48.286]  That's how they're doing it.
[02:41:48.306 --> 02:41:50.927]  They're saying we're fake when it's mainstream media that's doing all this.
[02:41:50.967 --> 02:41:55.829]  Well, think about all of the race crimes that have turned out to be hoaxes here.
[02:41:55.849 --> 02:41:57.529]  The latest thing with the Muslim women was all fake.
[02:41:57.669 --> 02:41:58.249]  Exactly.
[02:41:58.269 --> 02:42:05.452]  Oh, I've got attacked by a Trump supporter and turns out it was either fake or it was, you know, people who were busting Hillary Clinton supporters.
[02:42:05.472 --> 02:42:07.152]  By the way, this guy looks Arabic.
[02:42:07.232 --> 02:42:08.693]  I mean, is he even trolling that?
[02:42:09.795 --> 02:42:15.898]  I think that he actually is genuinely of some Arabic descent and speaks Arabic.
[02:42:16.719 --> 02:42:21.101]  But to be honest with you, look, the guy in a sense is a comedic genius.
[02:42:21.642 --> 02:42:25.024]  I mean, he totally plays off the ignorance of all the people on Twitter.
[02:42:25.044 --> 02:42:27.865]  I know, but see, he also knows they'll just use us to take our rights as well.
[02:42:28.025 --> 02:42:30.467]  He's got views like 32 million views.
[02:42:30.547 --> 02:42:32.048]  Again, this is why the major media is dead.
[02:42:32.915 --> 02:42:35.518]  The guy has videos with 30 million, 20 million, 10 million views.
[02:42:35.558 --> 02:42:36.078]  So do we.
[02:42:36.379 --> 02:42:37.620]  But we're covering serious stuff.
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:39.162]  This guy's pretending to blow up airplanes.
[02:42:39.502 --> 02:42:41.224]  Of course he's got 30 million views.
[02:42:41.484 --> 02:42:42.965]  I don't think this is legal.
[02:42:43.126 --> 02:42:44.647]  Listen, let me tell you something.
[02:42:44.707 --> 02:42:50.173]  If you get on an airplane like this, start doing countdowns and speaking in Arabic and gibberish, I'm going to kick your ass.
[02:42:50.253 --> 02:42:51.654]  There needs to be some consequences.
[02:42:51.674 --> 02:42:52.574]  I'm on there with my kids.
[02:42:52.714 --> 02:42:54.816]  You are going to have... I mean, I'm not acting tough here.
[02:42:55.096 --> 02:42:55.556]  No, it's not.
[02:42:55.616 --> 02:42:58.718]  Let me tell you, if somebody starts doing this crap with me, I'm going to tackle your ass.
[02:42:58.738 --> 02:43:03.180]  And it's not going to be my fault when I knock your teeth out because I thought you were trying to blow the plane up.
[02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:04.001]  I don't think this is funny.
[02:43:04.101 --> 02:43:05.282]  No, it's not funny at all.
[02:43:05.302 --> 02:43:07.383]  There definitely has to be some repercussions for it.
[02:43:07.903 --> 02:43:12.106]  And, you know, just the fact that Delta is now kind of scrambling.
[02:43:12.386 --> 02:43:14.187]  People on the plane are saying, that didn't happen at all.
[02:43:14.227 --> 02:43:15.908]  He wasn't even on a phone call with his mother.
[02:43:15.988 --> 02:43:16.608]  What are you saying?
[02:43:16.708 --> 02:43:17.309]  I'll tell you what we do.
[02:43:17.329 --> 02:43:19.450]  We've got to start hijacking all these pranksters, people.
[02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:30.015]  Take their stuff, review it, so we can copyright cover it, and then viral all their info, feedback loop, taking their energy from them, and then blasting them with it, so that they can't get away with this stuff.
[02:43:30.035 --> 02:43:32.917]  Because the guy, I mean, if he wants to come on and explain himself, maybe I'm wrong.
[02:43:33.257 --> 02:43:35.238]  But just as a first glance, this makes me angry.
[02:43:35.538 --> 02:43:41.281]  I mean, if I was on a plane with a guy going, 10, 9, 8, he's like, you'd be like, what the hell?
[02:43:41.641 --> 02:43:46.322]  Well, and if you think about it, if he's on a plane with an air marshal, he's gonna be lucky he doesn't get shot.
[02:43:46.482 --> 02:43:46.962]  Exactly.
[02:43:46.982 --> 02:43:54.704]  Well, and that's the thing is, anyone can get kicked off a plane if you've been asked to shut your phone off and you refuse, if you're talking too loudly, you're being...
[02:44:04.406 --> 02:44:09.149]  Yeah, you're gonna get kicked off the plane.
[02:44:09.289 --> 02:44:10.590]  How dare you kick me off?
[02:44:10.610 --> 02:44:11.331]  You're a racist.
[02:44:11.371 --> 02:44:12.552]  Don't kick me off.
[02:44:13.472 --> 02:44:15.113]  We have people that have been tackled on planes.
[02:44:15.133 --> 02:44:15.894]  Do that again, Owen.
[02:44:15.914 --> 02:44:18.596]  You look like the guy from Team America where he's like, do this.
[02:44:19.741 --> 02:44:21.342]  You know, wave your arms like this.
[02:44:21.362 --> 02:44:23.504]  He's like, save me!
[02:44:23.524 --> 02:44:25.385]  They're killing me!
[02:44:26.506 --> 02:44:27.727]  What's he doing?
[02:44:27.747 --> 02:44:28.588]  What is wrong with you?
[02:44:28.608 --> 02:44:29.869]  Why you kick me off plane?
[02:44:30.129 --> 02:44:31.270]  Why you kick me off plane?
[02:44:31.310 --> 02:44:32.771]  I just speak Arabic and say 10-9-8-5-4-3-2-1!
[02:44:35.908 --> 02:44:37.990]  I just say, I don't know, I'm a jihad!
[02:44:38.230 --> 02:44:40.973]  You know about this briefcase and all these wires and dials and stuff?
[02:44:40.993 --> 02:44:42.634]  And you're like, 10 is counting down?
[02:44:43.175 --> 02:44:44.296]  What's the countdown mean, son?
[02:44:44.596 --> 02:44:45.477]  I will not tell you.
[02:44:46.758 --> 02:44:47.799]  Here's what he's gonna do next.
[02:44:47.819 --> 02:44:55.306]  He's gonna go onto an airplane and he's gonna rig it up so that it somehow busts open and wires and crap goes flying everywhere.
[02:44:55.326 --> 02:44:57.589]  And then he's like, oh, you know, nothing, no big deal.
[02:44:57.609 --> 02:44:59.210]  And people are like, okay, you gotta get off the plane.
[02:44:59.230 --> 02:44:59.971]  He's like, racist!
[02:45:00.291 --> 02:45:00.712]  Racist!
[02:45:01.352 --> 02:45:03.194]  Yeah, if you wanted to get a good settlement from the airline.
[02:45:03.214 --> 02:45:05.035]  By the way, the media is saying people were racist to a Muslim.
[02:45:05.055 --> 02:45:05.875]  Was he saying that himself?
[02:45:07.537 --> 02:45:07.717]  Honestly?
[02:45:07.737 --> 02:45:12.160]  I'm sure he was saying racism was the reason why he believed he was kicked off the plane.
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:19.385]  But what I'm saying is, you know, all jokes aside, I really agree absolutely with you guys, but the bottom line is this.
[02:45:19.626 --> 02:45:23.949]  It's actually affecting all of us when they do things like this, when pranksters,
[02:45:24.409 --> 02:45:27.912]  You know, are being promoted by the mainstream media as if it's real news.
[02:45:28.012 --> 02:45:28.773]  It affects us.
[02:45:29.093 --> 02:45:32.596]  Today, I have two articles here that were linked on the Drudge Report.
[02:45:33.037 --> 02:45:34.678]  LAX evacuation updates.
[02:45:34.758 --> 02:45:40.403]  Some flight delays reported following brief evacuation after suspicious bags found at three terminals.
[02:45:40.763 --> 02:45:50.869]  You also have, you know, so many different ways that they're blocking off the Christmas markets now instead of, you know, creating actual borders outside of the country to minimize this immigration.
[02:45:51.169 --> 02:45:58.633]  They're creating all these checkpoints and basically different ways of bordering off people at these Christmas markets because they're afraid of it.
[02:45:59.013 --> 02:45:59.853]  Terrible.
[02:45:59.893 --> 02:46:03.455]  Checkpoints like in Israel, instead of controlling the border, they're turning us all into slaves.
[02:46:03.475 --> 02:46:03.855]  Great point.
[02:46:03.895 --> 02:46:04.456]  Exactly.
[02:46:04.916 --> 02:46:07.377]  As a prison planet, you know, as we promote here.
[02:46:07.777 --> 02:46:12.399]  And we really need to, like you said, definitely get a hold over this fake news.
[02:46:12.700 --> 02:46:18.422]  We can't have so many people promoting this fake kind of stuff because this is how it affects the average person.
[02:46:18.682 --> 02:46:27.587]  When you're just trying to travel with your family, you don't know what's going on, and then you have someone doing something like this, it just creates a lot of different security concerns for everyone else.
[02:46:27.747 --> 02:46:27.987]  I agree.
[02:46:28.607 --> 02:46:34.190]  I'm telling you guys all the time that I want you to pop in at least an hour every day.
[02:46:34.670 --> 02:46:41.314]  David, Ashley, you know all the other great folks, Margaret yourself, Darren McBreen, I mean the control room crew makes great points.
[02:46:41.654 --> 02:46:43.195]  I want to, because I would have never gone here.
[02:46:43.255 --> 02:46:50.339]  I knew about this but I was so focused on World War III, Obama wants to start, and you know suicide bomber little girls that we didn't point out
[02:46:50.839 --> 02:46:52.499]  The media knows this guy's fake.
[02:46:52.519 --> 02:47:01.221]  They're still running with it to create guilt about the Muslims because they're trying to cover up them blowing up stuff and stabbing people and shooting people and driving 18-wheelers over people.
[02:47:01.621 --> 02:47:04.182]  And it's just like such a freaking psy-op, so I'm glad.
[02:47:04.202 --> 02:47:12.764]  I think every day, at least 30 minutes to an hour, I've got to bring you guys on to kind of inject all the other news you're back there looking at, just stewing in for the nightly news.
[02:47:13.484 --> 02:47:17.265]  Yeah, well you've got a lot to get to with all these stacks of paper on your desk, so we can certainly
[02:47:17.964 --> 02:47:19.385]  Well, speaking of that, I got callers here.
[02:47:19.405 --> 02:47:21.466]  I want you guys to all pop in as we take these calls.
[02:47:21.746 --> 02:47:24.967]  A little bit in the next hour, then the great Roger Stone's taking over.
[02:47:25.007 --> 02:47:27.768]  But double-check and make sure he's not too under the weather, but I'm sure he's going to be.
[02:47:28.268 --> 02:47:29.649]  As the word is, he's doing it.
[02:47:29.669 --> 02:47:29.989]  He's doing it.
[02:47:30.009 --> 02:47:30.389]  Okay, good.
[02:47:30.589 --> 02:47:31.070]  I hadn't checked.
[02:47:31.090 --> 02:47:33.231]  He was just real sick with food poisoning or whatever it was.
[02:47:33.251 --> 02:47:33.931]  He thinks food poisoning.
[02:47:34.251 --> 02:47:38.653]  But I want to go to some of these callers, Don and Chris and Joe and Chris and Ben, but just briefly.
[02:47:39.685 --> 02:47:45.128]  Leanne, and then of course, are you guys there in the, what is it?
[02:47:45.628 --> 02:47:46.008]  Bravo.
[02:47:46.308 --> 02:47:47.069]  Bravo Studio.
[02:47:47.389 --> 02:47:48.929]  Alpha Bravo Tango, that's right.
[02:47:49.210 --> 02:47:50.550]  So you guys are in the Bravo Studio.
[02:47:51.010 --> 02:47:56.313]  Do you think they're going to try to stop Trump in the next 29 days after this whole fiasco we just witnessed?
[02:47:57.355 --> 02:48:08.162]  I think that what they're going to try to do is take it out of their own hands and kind of do the same thing we've been seeing with sending protesters out there or trying to intimidate the Electoral College.
[02:48:08.563 --> 02:48:10.804]  Something that puts it out of their hands.
[02:48:10.864 --> 02:48:13.866]  Or like Hillary Clinton making Jill Stein ask for the recount.
[02:48:14.106 --> 02:48:14.867]  Totally a fraud.
[02:48:15.487 --> 02:48:16.708]  They're going to use foils.
[02:48:16.728 --> 02:48:17.469]  They're going to use minions.
[02:48:17.549 --> 02:48:18.249]  Exactly.
[02:48:18.369 --> 02:48:18.850]  Exactly.
[02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:20.111]  And I think it's going to fall short.
[02:48:20.151 --> 02:48:22.392]  I don't think they have the support that they thought they had.
[02:48:22.412 --> 02:48:26.555]  I don't think they have the hearts and minds of Americans totally wrapped up like they thought they had.
[02:48:26.835 --> 02:48:27.295]  I agree.
[02:48:27.335 --> 02:48:30.437]  Look at how Hillary got lost electoral votes.
[02:48:30.477 --> 02:48:30.898]  Exactly.
[02:48:30.918 --> 02:48:31.318]  Yeah.
[02:48:31.918 --> 02:48:32.078]  Yep.
[02:48:32.959 --> 02:48:33.720]  Taken away from her.
[02:48:34.180 --> 02:48:34.820]  Absolutely.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:38.322]  I agree that they're still going to try to make strides whatever way they can.
[02:48:38.362 --> 02:48:41.685]  It seems like almost every week they're coming up with a new strategy.
[02:48:41.945 --> 02:48:43.146]  They're so delusional.
[02:48:43.186 --> 02:48:45.967]  These Hillary Clinton supporters or Bernie Sanders.
[02:48:46.007 --> 02:48:46.908]  I'm not sure who it is.
[02:48:46.948 --> 02:48:49.650]  Just basically agitators who are coming in.
[02:48:49.730 --> 02:48:50.570]  Communists, you know.
[02:48:50.730 --> 02:48:51.691]  We call them toddlers.
[02:48:51.811 --> 02:48:53.212]  Michelle calls them toddlers.
[02:48:53.352 --> 02:48:54.773]  They act like toddlers.
[02:48:55.033 --> 02:48:56.134]  They're the toddler brigade.
[02:48:56.314 --> 02:48:57.295]  Right, exactly.
[02:48:57.555 --> 02:48:59.696]  The Dodler Brigade, they're still crying.
[02:48:59.756 --> 02:49:04.118]  They still haven't accepted that Donald Trump is the President-elect.
[02:49:04.218 --> 02:49:09.241]  He's been confirmed by the Electoral College to just let it go.
[02:49:09.261 --> 02:49:10.842]  He's going to be our President.
[02:49:11.142 --> 02:49:20.827]  We need to keep our minds open, our eyes open, and accept him, but also criticize anything that we're seeing he's going to do with.
[02:49:21.007 --> 02:49:22.529]  We've got to keep him on the right path.
[02:49:22.930 --> 02:49:23.591]  Exactly.
[02:49:23.771 --> 02:49:24.773]  Ashley, let me ask you this question.
[02:49:26.055 --> 02:49:27.317]  How upset do you think they are now?
[02:49:27.357 --> 02:49:30.943]  They admit they are, that the economy finally is coming back, and they're panicking.
[02:49:31.898 --> 02:49:34.719]  Oh, they're completely up in arms about it.
[02:49:34.779 --> 02:49:52.467]  I mean, I don't know if Dow ended up going over $20,000, but I've been watching over the past few weeks, and I actually saw a tweet today, and I believe that since Trump has become president, president-elect, we've actually increased $1 trillion in our stock market.
[02:49:52.527 --> 02:49:55.709]  Well, exactly, and Krugman is panicking in the New York Times.
[02:49:55.869 --> 02:49:57.670]  He's been saying the economy's great under Obama.
[02:49:57.810 --> 02:49:58.870]  Now he's saying it's bad.
[02:49:59.270 --> 02:49:59.971]  That's all fake news.
[02:50:01.857 --> 02:50:05.798]  Well, I believe the Dow did hit 20,000 for the first time ever.
[02:50:05.818 --> 02:50:06.758]  Right.
[02:50:06.878 --> 02:50:11.799]  And then it hit like in a record like 11 or 12 times since Trump got nominated.
[02:50:11.839 --> 02:50:12.939]  That's racist.
[02:50:12.959 --> 02:50:14.240]  Well, it is racist.
[02:50:14.260 --> 02:50:15.080]  Everything's racist now.
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:25.082]  But back to what you were saying earlier, Alex, I think that what they would really love, I think that what they're really stewing here over, what they're really, you know, Mr. Burns, excellent.
[02:50:25.582 --> 02:50:29.287]  They would really love to see someone actually try to shoot Donald Trump.
[02:50:29.407 --> 02:50:30.548]  I really think that's what they want.
[02:50:30.568 --> 02:50:32.110]  They've had every major newspaper calling for it.
[02:50:32.150 --> 02:50:32.871]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[02:50:33.091 --> 02:50:34.192]  Laughing about his plane crash.
[02:50:34.212 --> 02:50:38.818]  If I said put a bullet in Obama, which I wouldn't do because I would turn him into a martyr, they'd arrest my ass and they should.
[02:50:39.138 --> 02:50:40.400]  Why have they get away with this?
[02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:40.900]  Right.
[02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:41.660]  It's insane.
[02:50:42.241 --> 02:50:43.121]  It is absolutely insane.
[02:50:43.141 --> 02:50:45.902]  And I'm supposed to just, again, the whole establishment's against him.
[02:50:46.222 --> 02:50:48.243]  And then people ask me, he's the establishment now.
[02:50:48.523 --> 02:50:49.723]  How is it being the establishment?
[02:50:49.983 --> 02:50:57.206]  The entire establishment is running around like chickens with their heads cut off from the Communist Chinese to the Pope to Oberman going, Russians come!
[02:50:57.226 --> 02:50:58.026]  War with Russia!
[02:50:58.306 --> 02:50:59.406]  War!
[02:51:02.528 --> 02:51:03.888]  Get to the chopper!
[02:51:05.048 --> 02:51:06.009]  It's a trap!
[02:51:06.229 --> 02:51:06.929]  We'll be back.
[02:51:07.069 --> 02:51:07.509]  Stay with us.
[02:51:09.995 --> 02:51:18.145]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[02:51:19.126 --> 02:51:27.917]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption, and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[02:51:28.778 --> 02:51:33.302]  Now, President-elect Trump has come out and said it's not his job as President to call for prosecution, he's not supposed to.
[02:51:33.783 --> 02:51:38.827]  But that obviously, Jeff Sessions, as the new Attorney General, if he's confirmed, will certainly carry out his duties.
[02:51:39.088 --> 02:51:45.754]  But Roger Stone, a few weeks ago, right after the election, said, Alex, you gotta bring Hillary for President back.
[02:51:45.814 --> 02:51:48.636]  And I said, yeah, but it's a limited edition, it's over.
[02:51:49.477 --> 02:51:50.958]  You know, she's been defeated so far.
[02:51:51.518 --> 02:51:54.420]  They said, what about Hillary for prison 2017?
[02:51:54.860 --> 02:51:56.321]  We need those at the inauguration.
[02:51:56.341 --> 02:52:00.243]  They're trying to intimidate Trump supporters and nationalists everywhere.
[02:52:00.663 --> 02:52:01.903]  That shirt is powerful.
[02:52:01.963 --> 02:52:16.711]  It's not just a shirt supporting Trump, like your shirt that says Trump is my president, which we put out before he won, predicting it, putting our name, our guts on the line, but something exposing who the other team was pushing so that people don't forget and so that the push for justice continues.
[02:52:17.331 --> 02:52:18.831]  So it's a great way to support the broadcast.
[02:52:18.851 --> 02:52:26.033]  It's a great way to have another historic shirt to spread the word and to meet like-minded people of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and want justice.
[02:52:26.553 --> 02:52:27.073]  It's available.
[02:52:27.133 --> 02:52:28.194]  It's another limited run.
[02:52:28.214 --> 02:52:31.434]  I don't know how long we're going to offer it, but definitely only a few months.
[02:52:31.915 --> 02:52:37.356]  It is Hillary for Prison 2017, and here's the biggest and best part I almost forgot.
[02:52:38.739 --> 02:52:46.301]  This shirt arrived in an 18-wheeler printed right here in the USA a week ago and I forgot, I've been so busy to even talk about the fact it's been in the store.
[02:52:47.161 --> 02:52:54.883]  That on the back of the shirt is a design that I worked on with some of our great graphics people that is George Soros as a goblin.
[02:52:55.583 --> 02:53:02.965]  I made a goblin joke a year ago about Trump saying you better not, you know, actually get in bed with the goblins if he has to work with politicians.
[02:53:02.985 --> 02:53:07.126]  I don't understand if he has to actually, you know, get needy for their political guts but you just can't
[02:53:08.564 --> 02:53:09.766]  Get caught in bed with a goblin.
[02:53:10.226 --> 02:53:17.175]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme, and they've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up in their face.
[02:53:17.615 --> 02:53:24.885]  We now have George Soros as a goblin on the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X like Ghostbusters.
[02:53:25.245 --> 02:53:26.987]  No Soros, him as a goblin.
[02:53:27.728 --> 02:53:32.870]  It says Deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[02:53:34.350 --> 02:53:41.432]  So it is a limited edition Deport Soros on the back, Hillary for President on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[02:53:41.793 --> 02:53:42.313]  It's powerful.
[02:53:42.333 --> 02:53:43.413]  I hope you get out to everybody you know.
[02:53:43.693 --> 02:53:47.494]  InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:53:47.794 --> 02:53:52.236]  So to all the fellow liberty lovers around the world, I salute you and thank you for your support.
[02:53:52.896 --> 02:54:04.065]  This shirt is a celebration of the fight and the victory we've seen in 2016 against tyranny, but looking forward for justice against George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and their entire criminal network.
[02:54:04.565 --> 02:54:06.927]  And don't forget our new motto, no more pizza parties.
[02:54:27.578 --> 02:54:34.090]  Let's go to that camera shot where we got those two great reporters in there.
[02:54:34.110 --> 02:54:34.732]  Just look at them.
[02:54:34.772 --> 02:54:35.273]  No, no, not us.
[02:54:35.293 --> 02:54:37.136]  Some good-looking reporters in there.
[02:54:39.070 --> 02:54:39.510]  They really do.
[02:54:40.571 --> 02:54:42.292]  Good old Ellen and Ashley kicking butt.
[02:54:43.573 --> 02:54:44.393]  Love train!
[02:54:46.775 --> 02:54:47.555]  Trump train!
[02:54:48.135 --> 02:54:48.616]  Yeah!
[02:54:48.976 --> 02:54:50.317]  Trump train!
[02:54:50.337 --> 02:54:51.618]  Get our own version of it.
[02:54:51.638 --> 02:54:52.318]  No, I mean, look.
[02:54:52.878 --> 02:54:54.339]  Trump's not going to be perfect, okay?
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:54:57.281]  But the guy's like a fossil, basically, of Americana.
[02:54:57.321 --> 02:54:58.642]  He wants to make everybody wealthy.
[02:54:59.102 --> 02:54:59.963]  He's very aggressive.
[02:55:01.124 --> 02:55:02.664]  He wants to dominate all these globalists.
[02:55:03.705 --> 02:55:04.825]  And we're going to see what he does.
[02:55:04.865 --> 02:55:07.065]  But overall, I like what I'm seeing so far.
[02:55:07.666 --> 02:55:12.047]  But getting off that subject, anytime you guys want to pop in, I want to start doing this every day.
[02:55:12.427 --> 02:55:15.888]  For at least one hour of the show, we just do this big roundtable.
[02:55:15.908 --> 02:55:17.328]  I've been wanting to do this the whole time.
[02:55:17.348 --> 02:55:19.548]  I get so focused on guests and news, I get so serious.
[02:55:20.069 --> 02:55:21.829]  We should sometimes just have some fun.
[02:55:21.849 --> 02:55:25.990]  Even though we're talking about assassinations and World War III and all the rest of it.
[02:55:26.010 --> 02:55:28.551]  But let me just ask you all this, and then I'm going to bend everybody else.
[02:55:28.931 --> 02:55:29.571]  What do you make
[02:55:30.586 --> 02:55:36.295]  Of NBC News reporting and others that Obama basically threatened military action against Russia, and the left's all proud of this.
[02:55:36.335 --> 02:55:36.956]  Like, good!
[02:55:37.316 --> 02:55:39.620]  Let's have a war because they got Trump elected.
[02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:41.122]  Are you people crazy?
[02:55:41.482 --> 02:55:42.544]  Number one, that's not true.
[02:55:42.844 --> 02:55:46.289]  Number two, Russia's not doing anything to us, you lunatics!
[02:55:46.690 --> 02:56:00.638]  Well, I think they're really revealing their true colors here because we have Chris Hayes coming out saying, you know, no matter what, no matter how deranged it is, no matter what kind of disinformation we got to put out there, we have to delegitimize the President-elect Donald Trump.
[02:56:00.658 --> 02:56:01.719]  We have to delegitimize.
[02:56:01.739 --> 02:56:06.702]  So they're okay with shutting down the First Amendment and then calling everyone else fake news.
[02:56:06.982 --> 02:56:08.343]  They're okay with putting out these
[02:56:08.983 --> 02:56:10.364]  Filters, news filters.
[02:56:10.404 --> 02:56:13.805]  It's like the ministry of truthiness has been rolled out.
[02:56:13.965 --> 02:56:17.707]  How much do they hate this country that they're willing to do whatever it takes?
[02:56:17.947 --> 02:56:18.367]  I agree.
[02:56:18.407 --> 02:56:19.207]  Ashley, what do you think?
[02:56:19.407 --> 02:56:19.787]  What do you think?
[02:56:19.988 --> 02:56:28.191]  Well, I think that actually Obama was just itching to use this red phone because we know when he got into office, he said, I have a pen, I have a phone.
[02:56:28.511 --> 02:56:38.535]  This was actually the first time that Obama was actually able to use the red phone system, which actually sends an encrypted email relating to cybersecurity.
[02:56:38.715 --> 02:56:39.576]  That's right.
[02:56:39.936 --> 02:56:41.977]  He's just trying to, you know, dominate.
[02:56:41.997 --> 02:56:43.558]  They only use it in case of war.
[02:56:43.598 --> 02:56:43.978]  That's right.
[02:56:44.018 --> 02:56:46.239]  In fact, using the red phone is a threat itself.
[02:56:47.140 --> 02:56:57.325]  He wants his legacy, he wants to go down, just as Hillary Clinton did, as being the one who started this World War III, who restarted the Cold War and made it a hot war with Russia.
[02:56:57.685 --> 02:56:59.686]  And, you know, basically bring down America.
[02:56:59.746 --> 02:57:00.527]  That's the whole thing.
[02:57:00.807 --> 02:57:06.270]  However you can bring down America, and especially since the Chai comms, you know, believe in communism,
[02:57:06.650 --> 02:57:08.191]  They're atheists and everything.
[02:57:08.351 --> 02:57:10.891]  That's the kind of regime he wants to bring to America.
[02:57:10.911 --> 02:57:12.892]  We've got to bring that word China on back.
[02:57:12.932 --> 02:57:14.212]  That was gold reporting.
[02:57:14.572 --> 02:57:15.233]  She's on fire.
[02:57:16.853 --> 02:57:17.573]  Ben in Michigan.
[02:57:17.813 --> 02:57:18.814]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:57:19.074 --> 02:57:20.054]  What do you think about all this?
[02:57:21.455 --> 02:57:21.795]  Hello Alex.
[02:57:21.815 --> 02:57:22.735]  Hey buddy.
[02:57:23.735 --> 02:57:27.296]  Hey, thank you so much for your patriotism and your service as a brother.
[02:57:27.316 --> 02:57:28.037]  I thank you.
[02:57:28.057 --> 02:57:28.817]  We're in this all together.
[02:57:28.837 --> 02:57:29.137]  Go ahead.
[02:57:30.146 --> 02:57:35.590]  I wanted to ask you, what do you see as the endgame to this net censorship, fake news garbage?
[02:57:36.150 --> 02:57:39.653]  If Trump's going to be president in February, won't he just reverse all that?
[02:57:39.673 --> 02:57:43.255]  Well, the problem is these are private tech companies.
[02:57:43.275 --> 02:57:44.616]  You've got Euro and China doing it.
[02:57:45.697 --> 02:57:47.458]  And Trump isn't going to be a dictator.
[02:57:47.478 --> 02:57:51.601]  I don't want him to be, but he's got to kind of organize the people to put pressure on companies not to do it.
[02:57:51.621 --> 02:57:52.442]  He can't be the leader.
[02:57:53.263 --> 02:57:53.463]  I'm
[02:58:11.445 --> 02:58:17.389]  Well yeah, I mean, you don't have Zuckerberg there building up a whole separate Facebook platform so that he can get into China.
[02:58:17.789 --> 02:58:20.931]  Obviously, they're going to use those same sort of tactics here.
[02:58:21.292 --> 02:58:21.972]  They admit they are!
[02:58:22.232 --> 02:58:22.713]  Exactly!
[02:58:23.313 --> 02:58:31.518]  That's what's crazy for me, Owen, and others, is that China's in our news lecturing us and admittedly helping get the fake news.
[02:58:31.799 --> 02:58:34.300]  Are foreign communists helping shut down Americans?
[02:58:34.540 --> 02:58:36.502]  But I agree with what you were just saying, Caller.
[02:58:36.642 --> 02:58:41.425]  This is a collision course because the President's here, we're rising, they're still though here, it's a civil war.
[02:58:41.925 --> 02:58:43.487]  We're in a civil war.
[02:58:43.767 --> 02:58:45.109]  It's a high-tech civil war.
[02:58:45.389 --> 02:58:46.310]  It's an info war.
[02:58:46.530 --> 02:58:47.251]  They're losing it.
[02:58:47.511 --> 02:58:49.893]  They wanted to get physical back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:50.214 --> 02:58:51.895]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:52.236 --> 02:58:52.896]  Great points, Ben.
[02:58:52.936 --> 02:58:53.657]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:58:53.697 --> 02:58:55.178]  And then, Roger Stone, stay with us.
[02:59:00.744 --> 02:59:02.125]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:59:02.405 --> 02:59:03.687]  You can't survive without it.
[02:59:03.887 --> 02:59:04.788]  But where do you get it?
[02:59:05.088 --> 02:59:10.854]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:59:11.074 --> 02:59:16.800]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:59:16.980 --> 02:59:33.847]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[02:59:36.728 --> 02:59:37.928]  Stainless steel construction.

[03:00:01.590 --> 03:00:05.692]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:00:06.212 --> 03:00:07.553]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:14.036 --> 03:00:14.896]  It's 3 AM.
[03:00:15.676 --> 03:00:17.377]  The hitman knows he's been cheated.
[03:00:18.658 --> 03:00:23.860]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:24.280 --> 03:00:25.681]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.021 --> 03:00:29.403]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:30.985 --> 03:00:32.426]  You know the raised fist of the globalists?
[03:00:32.446 --> 03:00:33.926]  People say, what's that communist symbol?
[03:00:34.587 --> 03:00:35.647]  They did that a hundred years ago.
[03:00:35.667 --> 03:00:37.028]  I'm taking the raised fist back.
[03:00:37.048 --> 03:00:38.728]  And we're going to resist the globalists.
[03:00:38.788 --> 03:00:39.549]  That's our symbol.
[03:00:40.689 --> 03:00:44.971]  It's like saying the Illuminati is the Jacobins in France and Germany.
[03:00:45.732 --> 03:00:47.092]  Illuminati just means enlightened.
[03:00:47.832 --> 03:00:48.493]  That's our term.
[03:00:48.993 --> 03:00:50.774]  We're taking it all back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:51.894 --> 03:00:56.196]  All right, we've got Ashley Beckford, we've got Owen Schor, we've got Liam McAdoo here, and a few more calls we're going to take.
[03:00:56.216 --> 03:00:57.337]  Appreciate folks calling.
[03:00:57.357 --> 03:00:57.677]  I want to say,
[03:00:58.337 --> 03:01:00.218]  Have a blessed, safe, great Christmas coming up.
[03:01:00.258 --> 03:01:01.558]  Obviously David Nights is here tomorrow.
[03:01:01.598 --> 03:01:02.779]  I'll be popping in with some reports.
[03:01:03.239 --> 03:01:04.319]  I love these roundtable reports.
[03:01:04.339 --> 03:01:07.360]  So just, I'm telling the producers, every day I want to get reporters in here.
[03:01:07.380 --> 03:01:08.041]  This is awesome.
[03:01:08.761 --> 03:01:10.562]  That's why he's built all the new studios and stuff.
[03:01:11.242 --> 03:01:13.783]  Dawn in Kentucky, thanks for holding your on the air worldwide.
[03:01:15.083 --> 03:01:15.724]  Hi Alex.
[03:01:15.744 --> 03:01:17.164]  Hi crew at InfoWars.
[03:01:17.744 --> 03:01:21.146]  I just want to say, Alex, one thing is thanks for that Prostagard.
[03:01:21.186 --> 03:01:22.246]  That stuff is great.
[03:01:22.961 --> 03:01:23.561]  Well, thank you.
[03:01:23.641 --> 03:01:25.562]  I mean, it's just good for, obviously, that.
[03:01:25.602 --> 03:01:27.563]  I mean, other glands.
[03:01:28.143 --> 03:01:31.444]  It's the strongest formula out there for less price than others.
[03:01:32.985 --> 03:01:37.627]  Well, I bought some for my husband, and I recommend, ladies, get your husband some.
[03:01:37.647 --> 03:01:39.187]  That stuff is just great.
[03:01:40.007 --> 03:01:43.529]  All your products we've got are great, but that one is really good.
[03:01:43.549 --> 03:01:44.129]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:01:44.169 --> 03:01:45.790]  Well, I like the face Ashley was just making.
[03:01:45.810 --> 03:01:46.790]  We've got to cut to that camera.
[03:01:49.011 --> 03:01:51.372]  Well, you've got to keep the equipment running there, don't you?
[03:01:54.184 --> 03:02:04.306]  I think Obama is going to try and start a war before, and I've seen this coming even during the election.
[03:02:04.786 --> 03:02:10.587]  They kept talking about Russia, and the worse Hillary was doing, the more they talked about it, and then after the election it was even more.
[03:02:12.868 --> 03:02:14.068]  And maybe that's why I'm so happy.
[03:02:14.088 --> 03:02:15.908]  Maybe the world's about to end and Jesus is coming back.
[03:02:15.928 --> 03:02:16.708]  We're all going to be dead.
[03:02:16.828 --> 03:02:18.649]  Maybe for Christmas Obama blows the planet up.
[03:02:18.749 --> 03:02:20.049]  It'll be okay because it's liberal.
[03:02:20.309 --> 03:02:20.749]  I'm alright.
[03:02:22.944 --> 03:02:24.285]  I guess that's just thinking.
[03:02:25.246 --> 03:02:25.786]  Great point.
[03:02:25.866 --> 03:02:26.947]  I mean, you know, we sit here joking.
[03:02:26.967 --> 03:02:29.068]  I think we've kind of hit peak insanity now.
[03:02:29.188 --> 03:02:29.388]  Right.
[03:02:29.428 --> 03:02:33.631]  So I'm just kind of like, at this point, I mean, he's like calling up the red phone threatening to attack Russia.
[03:02:33.731 --> 03:02:42.236]  Well, I think that's why they're all hands on deck, that they've got to delegitimize Trump, no matter how deranged it gets, how much disinformation they put out there, because there is this potential.
[03:02:42.537 --> 03:02:45.318]  Obama wants that Russian report on his desk before he leaves.
[03:02:45.558 --> 03:02:49.121]  What if he comes out and says, indeed, it's Russia, the election is invalid?
[03:02:49.801 --> 03:02:52.943]  And everyone in the country is, you know, okay with it because they've been watching the fake news.
[03:02:52.963 --> 03:02:54.784]  And now we know he's threatening military action.
[03:02:54.824 --> 03:02:56.065]  Probably killing that ambassador.
[03:02:56.265 --> 03:02:56.465]  Right.
[03:02:56.925 --> 03:02:58.086]  Trying to like, poke Russia.
[03:02:58.506 --> 03:02:59.907]  And let's rewind the clock backs.
[03:03:00.047 --> 03:03:04.550]  Remember during the campaign cycle, Obama did not want to mention Russia.
[03:03:04.610 --> 03:03:06.411]  He did not want to mention the WikiLeaks.
[03:03:06.431 --> 03:03:07.631]  He didn't even want to touch that.
[03:03:07.671 --> 03:03:08.532]  So what did he do?
[03:03:08.912 --> 03:03:15.516]  He had his minions like Joe Biden and other people of that ilk come out and say, Russia hacking, Russia hacking.
[03:03:15.776 --> 03:03:17.337]  And then he comes out now and says, well,
[03:03:17.777 --> 03:03:19.857]  We've been talking and reporting about Russian hacking.
[03:03:19.877 --> 03:03:21.298]  We've known about this for six months.
[03:03:21.318 --> 03:03:22.278]  We've been telling you about this.
[03:03:22.798 --> 03:03:26.359]  No, your minions were telling us about this because you didn't want to touch the topic.
[03:03:26.379 --> 03:03:26.739]  Exactly.
[03:03:26.979 --> 03:03:28.019]  Now you want to touch it.
[03:03:28.599 --> 03:03:30.400]  We got Joe, Chris, and I'll try to get these coming up.
[03:03:30.420 --> 03:03:35.441]  I'm going to go a little bit into, I'm going to introduce Stone here, but Joe in New York was talking about the next event.
[03:03:35.701 --> 03:03:36.581]  They've been attacking Trump.
[03:03:36.601 --> 03:03:37.501]  What's the next event, Joe?
[03:03:38.541 --> 03:03:39.221]  Hey, Alex.
[03:03:39.281 --> 03:03:41.562]  I think the first time I got through it was about nine years of listening.
[03:03:43.349 --> 03:03:52.033]  I think that we're kind of missing the point when, you remember back in the 2008 election, Obama said, I'll have more flexibility, you know, after the election.
[03:03:52.093 --> 03:03:59.857]  Maybe he was talking about that election, but maybe, you know, this is really where he has more flexibility with Putin, and, you know, as much as I want to believe that he's going to be a good guy,
[03:04:00.556 --> 03:04:02.876]  I mean, he's still an active participant in the Syria war.
[03:04:02.916 --> 03:04:04.537]  He's, you know, still sending troops there.
[03:04:04.597 --> 03:04:06.397]  Oh, he's attacking Russia, basically.
[03:04:06.437 --> 03:04:06.977]  He's crazy.
[03:04:07.057 --> 03:04:08.377]  I mean, look who he's advised by.
[03:04:08.418 --> 03:04:09.678]  Brzezinski's completely insane.
[03:04:09.758 --> 03:04:12.958]  He's out there playing golf when there's terror attacks going on.
[03:04:13.238 --> 03:04:14.979]  I mean, he's deranged.
[03:04:15.539 --> 03:04:17.019]  With one month left in office.
[03:04:17.659 --> 03:04:19.079]  One month and he's going to hit the golf course.
[03:04:19.139 --> 03:04:21.640]  Terror, every time someone gets their head chopped off, he's like, oh.
[03:04:21.660 --> 03:04:22.320]  Great point, Joe.
[03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:24.941]  I'm going to hold you guys over to say hi to Roger Stone, all of you, but real quick.
[03:04:25.261 --> 03:04:27.001]  Chris, in Georgia, what's the next event?
[03:04:29.329 --> 03:04:31.493]  Um, Alex, just one quick question for you.
[03:04:31.793 --> 03:04:31.994]  Sure.
[03:04:33.637 --> 03:04:40.809]  You keep mentioning the elites are trying to kill Donald, but since Pence has far more establishment than Trump, I mean, pro-TVP, isn't that certain?
[03:04:41.929 --> 03:04:43.910]  Yeah, I mean, I think Pence has done a lot of good things.
[03:04:43.950 --> 03:04:44.790]  Overall, very conservative.
[03:04:44.810 --> 03:04:47.752]  I wouldn't call him super-establishment, but he's definitely an establishment Republican.
[03:04:48.692 --> 03:04:51.013]  But a lot better choice than some of the others.
[03:04:51.033 --> 03:04:51.734]  That's a good question.
[03:04:51.754 --> 03:04:52.894]  We should ask that coming up.
[03:04:53.234 --> 03:04:53.734]  Thank you, Chris.
[03:04:53.774 --> 03:04:55.795]  And then Chris in Virginia, let's talk about the next step.
[03:04:56.756 --> 03:04:57.616]  And then also Charlie.
[03:04:57.636 --> 03:05:00.297]  But we're going to come in and say hi to Roger Stone.
[03:05:00.317 --> 03:05:02.438]  We're going to have a few issues with him, then hand the baton.
[03:05:02.458 --> 03:05:05.200]  He's always got a loaded broadcast when he hosts the 4th Hour.
[03:05:05.760 --> 03:05:06.140]  Stay with us.
[03:05:06.200 --> 03:05:07.581]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[03:05:10.287 --> 03:05:14.648]  Paul Krugman wants you to know that he is smarter than you.
[03:05:14.908 --> 03:05:21.530]  He's an American economist, distinguished professor of economics, and writer for the New York Times.
[03:05:21.930 --> 03:05:29.552]  Yesterday, Krugman posted a short article on his Twitter account, warning America about what he calls Trumponomics.
[03:05:29.872 --> 03:05:38.634]  He says to join the Trump administration, you have to be a white nationalist and, here comes the C word, a conspiracy theorist.
[03:05:39.094 --> 03:05:47.142]  Most of us living outside the Matrix know better than to take Krugman seriously because he's been wrong so many times in the past.
[03:05:47.402 --> 03:05:54.809]  It was Paul Krugman himself who predicted back in 1998 the drastically slow growth of the Internet.
[03:05:55.029 --> 03:05:56.130]  And I'm gonna quote him here.
[03:05:56.351 --> 03:06:03.999]  By 2005, it will be clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine.
[03:06:04.300 --> 03:06:08.745]  You can learn more about Paul Krugman's liberal logic right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:06:10.202 --> 03:06:10.682]  Not a group.
[03:06:10.743 --> 03:06:12.124]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:06:12.164 --> 03:06:13.245]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:06:13.505 --> 03:06:14.426]  Why is this so good?
[03:06:14.706 --> 03:06:19.951]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:06:20.031 --> 03:06:33.604]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:06:33.664 --> 03:06:35.045]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:06:35.786 --> 03:06:37.368]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:06:37.448 --> 03:06:39.950]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:06:40.030 --> 03:06:41.291]  These are all parasites.
[03:06:41.351 --> 03:06:42.432]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:06:42.452 --> 03:06:43.493]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:06:43.794 --> 03:06:48.138]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:06:48.338 --> 03:06:51.521]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:06:51.561 --> 03:06:54.665]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:06:54.685 --> 03:06:55.706]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:06:55.746 --> 03:06:57.649]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:06:57.709 --> 03:06:58.730]  And folks, you can't lose.

[03:07:04.738 --> 03:07:06.621]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:07:07.001 --> 03:07:08.964]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:07:10.194 --> 03:07:19.219]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:07:19.299 --> 03:07:27.383]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:07:27.683 --> 03:07:32.384]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:07:32.564 --> 03:07:39.286]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:39.346 --> 03:07:46.428]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:07:46.528 --> 03:07:53.390]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:07:53.550 --> 03:07:57.912]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:07:58.032 --> 03:08:01.294]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:08:01.434 --> 03:08:07.558]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:08:07.738 --> 03:08:09.399]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[03:08:19.545 --> 03:08:24.707]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:25.888 --> 03:08:29.789]  Alright, I am going to hand the baton to Roger Stone, who every Wednesday hosts the 4th Hour.
[03:08:29.869 --> 03:08:32.550]  We're going to get him some liners made soon.
[03:08:32.570 --> 03:08:38.733]  We're going to be adding some other talk show hosts here to the Info War, what we call Info Wars, live as well.
[03:08:39.993 --> 03:08:40.973]  Now I'm about to punch out.
[03:08:41.574 --> 03:08:44.315]  I've got Ashley Beckford and Owen Schroeder in
[03:08:45.515 --> 03:08:49.077]  The other studio, we're here in the Alpha Studio, Leanne McAdoo.
[03:08:49.357 --> 03:08:52.319]  But I wanted to bring this up to Roger Stone because I love Christmas.
[03:08:52.359 --> 03:08:53.199]  I love the holidays.
[03:08:53.219 --> 03:08:55.040]  I love spending time with family.
[03:08:55.420 --> 03:08:56.441]  I love spending time with the crew.
[03:08:57.621 --> 03:08:58.742]  We're all having a pretty good time.
[03:08:58.762 --> 03:09:00.023]  Donald Trump's elected.
[03:09:00.063 --> 03:09:07.186]  Gallup says it's the highest level of confidence in business and individuals ever recorded in Gallup's hundred-plus year history.
[03:09:08.327 --> 03:09:09.908]  They call it Trump-phorium.
[03:09:11.991 --> 03:09:17.232]  Tens of billions of dollars every week are being announced of new jobs coming back in because we don't have a president who's out to get us.
[03:09:18.673 --> 03:09:36.317]  But meanwhile, two months ago, Hillary, Obama, and the head of NATO, I'm looking at Reuters right here, massive cyber attack triggered NATO response, Stotenberg, head of NATO, they went on to say in the fourth paragraph that the new policy of NATO would respond to a cyber attack with conventional weapons.
[03:09:37.817 --> 03:09:40.658]  Says conventional weapons.
[03:09:42.182 --> 03:09:44.664]  Now it's being reported up on Infowars.com.
[03:09:44.684 --> 03:09:58.616]  There's also an NBC report that Obama, when he called the red phone last week, said we could militarily strike you with no proof that there was actually a Russian hack when we have the Chinese, communists, the Saudi Arabians, everybody else bragging.
[03:09:59.500 --> 03:10:02.302]  That they gave, in the case of the Saudis, 20% of the money to her.
[03:10:02.702 --> 03:10:04.023]  This is unbelievable.
[03:10:04.364 --> 03:10:07.706]  So, Roger Stone joins us from his studios.
[03:10:08.147 --> 03:10:16.013]  And I gotta say, he's amply dressed up like a James Bond either villain or, I guess, MI6 officer.
[03:10:16.753 --> 03:10:21.478]  But he does look like he's dressed up, you know, to like try to repel a death squad assault.
[03:10:22.198 --> 03:10:24.801]  So it's kind of best of times, worst of times here.
[03:10:25.141 --> 03:10:26.783]  We have the Christmas trees and all the fun.
[03:10:27.183 --> 03:10:35.311]  And meanwhile, with 29 days until the seating of Trump, you have all this great stuff happening while the left goes into total insane asylum behavior.
[03:10:35.812 --> 03:10:38.434]  MTV launches videos saying whites are inherently evil.
[03:10:38.875 --> 03:10:39.916]  They withdraw the video.
[03:10:40.436 --> 03:10:42.098]  It seems like they are melting down.
[03:10:42.138 --> 03:10:44.560]  The problem is they've got the nukes for 29 days.
[03:10:44.660 --> 03:10:58.511]  I'm told by my Pentagon sources and CIA sources and other sources that there are, yeah, there are folks as high up as you get, so I put generals in, waiting for them to try a counter-coup, and it's going to be... And we don't want that, but that's what we're seeing.
[03:10:59.632 --> 03:11:02.413]  There's articles that I'm saying a rogue group of CIA could try to kill him.
[03:11:02.873 --> 03:11:06.315]  When they call him a KGB agent or an FSB agent, that's what we're talking about.
[03:11:06.755 --> 03:11:11.076]  I think the next 29 days are the most important in human existence.
[03:11:11.456 --> 03:11:13.377]  Roger Stone, no need to respond back.
[03:11:13.437 --> 03:11:16.418]  I just want to hand the baton to you and get your response to that, my friend.
[03:11:16.438 --> 03:11:18.099]  I know you have a loaded roster here today.
[03:11:19.462 --> 03:11:20.723]  Well Alex, you're exactly right.
[03:11:20.763 --> 03:11:24.447]  You see, the whole the Russians did it gambit has failed.
[03:11:25.148 --> 03:11:32.555]  As the Infowars site shows today, 29% of the people, not even a third, believe this canard.
[03:11:33.195 --> 03:11:43.726]  So despite the very best efforts of the Washington Post, the New York Times, former acting CIA Director Mike Morrell, current CIA Director John Brennan,
[03:11:44.346 --> 03:11:49.571]  Special focus on those two in my upcoming book, by the way, The Making of the President 2016.
[03:11:50.031 --> 03:11:50.832]  They have failed.
[03:11:51.192 --> 03:11:56.597]  This entire gambit, this coup d'etat aimed at the electorate has failed.
[03:11:57.678 --> 03:12:02.001]  And now they would like to plunge us into war before Trump can get sworn in.
[03:12:02.882 --> 03:12:03.122]  I don't
[03:12:17.759 --> 03:12:26.563]  My friend, again, I'm going to let you get to your big show you've got lined up, but I would imagine you agree with me that this is front and center, a clear and present danger of the highest order.
[03:12:26.603 --> 03:12:35.748]  I mean, they're saying, from Keith Olbermann to Maddow, just Russian scum foaming at their mouth, beating the tables, just calling for war.
[03:12:35.828 --> 03:12:37.128]  It's total insanity.
[03:12:37.709 --> 03:12:43.691]  I believe that these are megalomaniacs who cannot stand the fact that they have been removed and are clutching on.
[03:12:43.791 --> 03:12:45.392]  I know, obviously, Trump's aware of this.
[03:12:47.153 --> 03:12:49.516]  Talking to Owen and talking to Ashley and of course Leanne.
[03:12:49.816 --> 03:12:50.837]  Any other points or questions?
[03:12:50.857 --> 03:12:52.920]  Then we're going to hand this over to Roger Stone.
[03:12:53.100 --> 03:12:55.823]  Well, I think that they've been building this for a while, Alex.
[03:12:55.903 --> 03:13:04.293]  Joe Biden said that we will respond with a physical attack to a cyber attack just as a general statement a few months ago.
[03:13:04.353 --> 03:13:06.115]  Didn't mention Russia or anything, just a general statement.
[03:13:07.682 --> 03:13:09.803]  Respond to a cyber attack with a physical attack.
[03:13:09.843 --> 03:13:10.803]  Now you got the red phone.
[03:13:10.823 --> 03:13:12.004]  You got the rhetoric from Obama.
[03:13:12.024 --> 03:13:13.284]  You got 29 days left.
[03:13:13.504 --> 03:13:14.785]  They don't want to hand over power.
[03:13:15.145 --> 03:13:16.145]  You know what's at stake.
[03:13:16.286 --> 03:13:17.466]  We all know what's at stake.
[03:13:17.506 --> 03:13:18.566]  Trump knows what's at stake.
[03:13:18.947 --> 03:13:24.749]  I think for you to say these next 29 days are some of the most pivotal in human history is perfectly reasonable.
[03:13:24.769 --> 03:13:27.310]  Remember what Chile... Sadly, most people don't understand that, Alex.
[03:13:27.470 --> 03:13:29.071]  Was it Chile or was it Brazil?
[03:13:29.111 --> 03:13:30.891]  I was getting mixed up in the Falklands War.
[03:13:31.772 --> 03:13:33.112]  I watched a documentary about it years ago.
[03:13:33.132 --> 03:13:34.613]  I remember watching it when I was a kid.
[03:13:35.694 --> 03:13:40.741]  The president was about to get removed from office, so he just launched a war to be popular.
[03:13:40.761 --> 03:13:42.803]  This is the oldest trick in the book.
[03:13:44.125 --> 03:13:44.626]  Roger Stone.
[03:13:46.018 --> 03:13:48.799]  Yes, Alex, I think there's a lot to what you say.
[03:13:49.359 --> 03:13:56.923]  I'm particularly concerned that you've had these assassinations of three high-level Soviet, or I should say, high-level Russian officials.
[03:13:57.563 --> 03:14:02.185]  One has to wonder whether that isn't some provocation by the neocons.
[03:14:02.265 --> 03:14:07.167]  Now, I'm not a deeply religious person, but I believe in God, and I'm a Christian.
[03:14:07.887 --> 03:14:14.333]  And I pray for Donald Trump every night because I think the easiest way to end this revolution would be to take out the leader.
[03:14:15.194 --> 03:14:22.080]  And I pray that he and his family will be safe through the inauguration and through the eight years of his presidency.
[03:14:22.100 --> 03:14:32.630]  Do you agree with me that claiming all this and activating COG and trying to start a war could be cover for civil unrest and a rogue group of the CIA or other group assassinating President Trump?
[03:14:33.919 --> 03:14:40.113]  Well, part of the problem here, Alex, is I think that President Obama will only do those things that he thinks he can get away with.
[03:14:41.088 --> 03:14:57.139]  When only 29% of the people buy this whole Russian yarn about the hijacking of the election, I think Obama has to be concerned that he doesn't have the kind of support in the country to pull off that kind of martial law, that kind of repression.
[03:14:57.499 --> 03:14:58.640]  I think the people would revolt.
[03:14:58.660 --> 03:14:58.960]  I agree.
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:02.142]  People should call the White House, write letters, emails, and say, we know what you're doing, back off.
[03:15:02.282 --> 03:15:03.343]  All right, I'm going to hand the baton to you.
[03:15:03.383 --> 03:15:04.184]  Sorry to cut into the time.
[03:15:04.464 --> 03:15:05.825]  Roger, amazing job.
[03:15:06.005 --> 03:15:06.485]  Roger Stone.
[03:15:07.446 --> 03:15:08.286]  Great to be here, Alex.
[03:15:08.326 --> 03:15:08.827]  Many thanks.
[03:15:10.680 --> 03:15:16.383]  All right, so we're going to move now to a very interesting matter that has come to my attention.
[03:15:17.243 --> 03:15:38.114]  And that is an article by Jacob Engels, libertarian activist in Orlando, Florida, who tells us that the Pulse nightclub victims, those people killed in the gay nightclub by Islamic terrorists, have brought a lawsuit against Twitter and Google and Facebook and YouTube
[03:15:38.914 --> 03:15:49.318]  Because while anti-Islamic messages have been censored, no effort was taken to censor the very people who perpetrated this attack.
[03:15:49.398 --> 03:15:50.898]  So, Jacob, are you with us?
[03:15:53.339 --> 03:15:54.479]  I'm going to keep moving along.
[03:15:55.560 --> 03:15:58.381]  I recommend this piece, which you can find at
[03:16:00.183 --> 03:16:03.606]  The East Orlando Post, actually this piece was put up by Channel 13.
[03:16:03.666 --> 03:16:14.635]  This is part and parcel of the entire fake news and censorship campaign that Alex Jones has been thinking about.
[03:16:15.235 --> 03:16:16.316]  Jacob, are you with us now?
[03:16:17.056 --> 03:16:17.577]  Yes, sir.
[03:16:18.478 --> 03:16:18.718]  Great.
[03:16:19.078 --> 03:16:20.919]  So, lay this out for us.
[03:16:20.960 --> 03:16:28.886]  We'll go to the end of the segment and we'll pick you up on the other side because this is a fascinating story and I think the InfoWars listeners and viewers need to hear it.
[03:16:29.841 --> 03:16:30.522]  Absolutely.
[03:16:31.242 --> 03:16:34.484]  What you've already said really hits home the point.
[03:16:34.865 --> 03:16:44.031]  These social media giants, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, they have allowed the radical Islamic terrorists to use this platform.
[03:16:44.051 --> 03:16:49.295]  They have allowed radical Islamic terrorists to push their propaganda on these platforms.
[03:16:49.835 --> 03:16:57.818]  Yet they're somehow more worried about censoring people like Alex Jones, yourself, Milo Yiannopoulos, from Breitbart.
[03:16:58.219 --> 03:17:01.480]  So it's a really concerning double standard that they're having.
[03:17:01.820 --> 03:17:10.604]  They throw their hands up in the air and say, oh, there's just too many accounts, they're popping up all over the place, we don't have time, we can't stop the terrorists, but they
[03:17:11.724 --> 03:17:13.989]  Absolutely can, and we've seen them do it.
[03:17:14.310 --> 03:17:15.752]  They censored so many people through 2016.
[03:17:16.434 --> 03:17:18.498]  Conservatives, libertarians, freethinkers.
[03:17:19.099 --> 03:17:21.644]  So it really is not a valid excuse.
[03:17:22.932 --> 03:17:36.401]  No, clearly they are using the backdoor to Google to censor alternative thought, conservative thought, ironically blaming us for fake news when they are the ones who are promulgating the fake news.
[03:17:37.081 --> 03:17:52.552]  This is one of the main reasons why I urge people to go to the Infowars.com site and sign the petition so that we can make President Trump well aware of the fact that the Congress is about to finance and fund what is in essence a censorship board.
[03:17:53.392 --> 03:17:53.812]  We're good to go.
[03:18:13.761 --> 03:18:31.659]  Uh, that this issue is on his agenda and he understands the effort to censor those, um, who supported his candidacy or who reported news, uh, that was legitimate during the campaign and couldn't be silenced like the New York Times, the Washington Post and others who were playing the game.
[03:18:33.681 --> 03:18:34.181]  Absolutely.
[03:18:35.362 --> 03:18:39.285]  So let me ask you, while we're at it, what is your view so far?
[03:18:39.325 --> 03:18:41.207]  I know you're of the more libertarian bent.
[03:18:41.247 --> 03:18:44.610]  How do you feel about the Trump cabinet today?
[03:18:45.811 --> 03:18:57.881]  I think President-elect Trump has demonstrated a unique ability to surround himself with not only business leaders, but leaders in their own realms.
[03:18:58.142 --> 03:19:00.744]  And what we often forget about
[03:19:01.024 --> 03:19:01.664]  He is a great person.
[03:19:17.029 --> 03:19:19.370]  Of these human beings, of these individuals.
[03:19:19.390 --> 03:19:21.631]  And I think he's done a really good job so far.
[03:19:21.731 --> 03:19:24.773]  I'd like to see Peter Thiel become involved.
[03:19:25.053 --> 03:19:28.094]  I would love Ron Paul to become involved in some capacity.
[03:19:28.515 --> 03:19:33.377]  And I think he'll move towards picks like that as we get closer to the inauguration.
[03:19:34.599 --> 03:19:38.320]  Well, of course, I'd like to see Judge Jeanine Pirro as the new FBI Director.
[03:19:38.700 --> 03:19:39.880]  She could clean house there.
[03:19:40.500 --> 03:19:46.702]  I'd like to see Kimberly Guilfoyle go to the White House Press Shop to be the President's spokesperson.
[03:19:47.562 --> 03:19:51.303]  I'd like, of course, to see Judge Andrew Napolitano go to the U.S.
[03:19:51.323 --> 03:19:52.003]  Supreme Court.
[03:19:52.043 --> 03:19:53.544]  Now, that's my dream team.
[03:19:53.564 --> 03:19:58.365]  A lot of people there from Fox, but nonetheless, good people, capable people.
[03:19:59.085 --> 03:20:00.426]  With a real background.
[03:20:00.466 --> 03:20:12.175]  I mean, Jeanine Pirro was a career prosecutor, and she has a better and more finite understanding of the crimes of the Clintons than anyone I have seen on the air.
[03:20:12.655 --> 03:20:16.919]  By the way, you can go to Stone Cold Truth and sign the petition to charge Hillary.
[03:20:17.639 --> 03:20:21.782]  Anybody who thinks that we don't remember when liberals told us no person
[03:20:22.623 --> 03:20:30.587]  Is above the law, and that we are not going to press for a full investigation and an accurate cataloging of the Clintons' crimes.
[03:20:31.108 --> 03:20:33.269]  Well, no justice and no peace.
[03:20:34.289 --> 03:20:36.791]  I am not going to stop raising this question.
[03:20:37.351 --> 03:20:42.854]  I think that we're going to learn more about the Clintons' crimes in early 2016, 2017, pardon me, as the
[03:20:48.945 --> 03:20:55.510]  Huma Abedin, Anthony Weiner, treasure trove of documents becomes available.
[03:20:56.110 --> 03:21:02.175]  I actually saw, speaking of fiction, a terrific piece by John Podesta this week.
[03:21:03.456 --> 03:21:15.845]  And I'm not sure which is worse, that Podesta is in denial about what just happened in the election, or that the Washington Post actually prints this crap.
[03:21:16.943 --> 03:21:29.090]  Because he actually says, for example, that there was a full investigation of Hillary, and they could find no evidence of lawbreaking regarding her email server.
[03:21:29.851 --> 03:21:31.492]  And it wasn't even close, his words.
[03:21:32.232 --> 03:21:41.998]  Actually, even the FBI director outlined her crimes, then announced to the shock of everyone she wouldn't be prosecuted, because she was, at least at that juncture, above the law.
[03:21:42.819 --> 03:21:46.201]  He repeats again, the canard that
[03:21:47.318 --> 03:21:51.340]  Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, Donald Trump are somehow in league with the Russians.
[03:21:51.980 --> 03:21:54.221]  The Russians were aiding the Trump campaign again.
[03:21:54.241 --> 03:22:00.503]  The exact same charge he made before the election, now making it again after the election.
[03:22:00.523 --> 03:22:03.244]  No supplemental facts, no evidence.
[03:22:03.584 --> 03:22:10.987]  Even PolitiFacts yesterday actually reports that there is no evidence whatsoever.
[03:22:11.980 --> 03:22:15.441]  of Russian hacking in our electoral system.
[03:22:16.122 --> 03:22:28.947]  So the three-part campaign waged by the left, pounding the drum about the popular vote, pounding the drum about the recount.
[03:22:28.967 --> 03:22:38.091]  We're going to have voting expert and election law expert John Haggerty, probably the most respected guy in the Republican Party when it comes to these issues.
[03:22:38.571 --> 03:22:40.492]  He is the guy the Trump campaign sent
[03:22:41.132 --> 03:22:47.795]  Along with the team of others to Wisconsin, he's going to tell us about the fraud that was the Wisconsin recount.
[03:22:48.896 --> 03:23:04.104]  We are going to also, I think, down the road, we're going to focus on my labor of love, the making of the President 2016, which I am rushing to get a manuscript to the printer even as we speak.
[03:23:05.500 --> 03:23:11.183]  I do want to take a quick moment for a break because the inaugural will be upon us very shortly.
[03:23:12.304 --> 03:23:17.486]  And everybody in my crew, everybody in my family is wearing a Trump is my president t-shirt.
[03:23:18.847 --> 03:23:21.368]  This is the show of solidarity.
[03:23:21.388 --> 03:23:23.569]  You can go to Infowars.com and buy these.
[03:23:24.390 --> 03:23:27.111]  This t-shirt's going to end up in the Smithsonian, folks.
[03:23:27.791 --> 03:23:30.633]  Get it now because this is the original deal.
[03:23:31.213 --> 03:23:34.215]  Believe me, the trained eye will be able to tell the counterfeits.
[03:23:34.975 --> 03:23:36.155]  This is not a counterfeit.
[03:23:36.696 --> 03:23:47.520]  This is the original InfoWars shirt, and you can get it now, but if you want to have it by the inauguration, I suggest you go right to the InfoWars.com store.
[03:23:48.180 --> 03:23:53.222]  Now, I also want to mention that you have an entire super sale going on for Christmas.
[03:23:53.862 --> 03:23:56.063]  Two of my favorite products, Brain Force,
[03:23:56.843 --> 03:24:00.767]  Which, frankly, there'd be zero chance I could finish this book manuscript without it.
[03:24:01.428 --> 03:24:08.836]  You wake up in the morning, you pop a couple of these, and believe me, it energizes you, it gives you mental clarity, it gives you focus.
[03:24:09.497 --> 03:24:12.960]  There would be no chance I could finish this book in time for the deadline without it.
[03:24:13.941 --> 03:24:23.926]  I also am a big fan of, I think it's DNA formula, I think it's bio-DNA, which I utilized recently for a little stomach upset.
[03:24:23.966 --> 03:24:31.829]  We'll come back and talk about that now, but free shipping, deep discounts on all of the best products at Infowars.com.
[03:24:32.149 --> 03:24:34.710]  If you want them in time for Christmas, folks, you gotta move.
[03:24:35.251 --> 03:24:36.171]  But this is a twofer.
[03:24:36.851 --> 03:24:41.854]  You can help the revolution, and you can buy these outstanding and carefully tested products.
[03:24:42.734 --> 03:24:46.096]  Alex Jones and the folks at InfoWars put nothing up on their site.
[03:24:46.577 --> 03:24:53.861]  It doesn't have many, many testimonies in which they themselves have not tried and found to be efficient and well worth the money.
[03:24:54.922 --> 03:24:57.664]  Some of these are the purest forms you can get.
[03:24:57.764 --> 03:25:02.447]  Now, I'm one who has dabbled, you know, in herbs and natural supplements for many years.
[03:25:02.587 --> 03:25:04.828]  I'm a follower of Eastern medicine.
[03:25:05.348 --> 03:25:07.370]  Rarely have I seen the quality
[03:25:08.294 --> 03:25:11.735]  of the herbs that you can get on the InfoWars store.
[03:25:11.775 --> 03:25:15.377]  You can get watered down and diluted second quality online.
[03:25:15.677 --> 03:25:16.677]  Don't go for it, folks.
[03:25:16.997 --> 03:25:18.058]  This is the real deal.
[03:25:19.018 --> 03:25:21.099]  So let us continue.
[03:25:21.219 --> 03:25:23.159]  Do we have John Haggerty on hand?
[03:25:23.920 --> 03:25:25.080]  Why don't we reach out for him?
[03:25:25.120 --> 03:25:32.663]  And while we're waiting for that report, I do want to talk about what is coming in Washington, because it is scary.
[03:25:34.184 --> 03:25:34.644]  We had
[03:25:35.632 --> 03:25:41.497]  An operative who infiltrated the J20 committee planning session.
[03:25:42.779 --> 03:25:51.607]  And let me go through what these folks have in mind, because this is not some benign, civilly disobedient protest.
[03:25:52.468 --> 03:25:55.450]  They intend to march from McPherson Square to Columbus Square.
[03:25:56.311 --> 03:26:00.575]  They are going to march during the lunch period immediately after the inauguration, approximately 12.30.
[03:26:02.287 --> 03:26:06.009]  Their goal is to, and I quote, create a sense of crisis.
[03:26:07.290 --> 03:26:11.092]  They are going to harass inaugural visitors as they step off the metro stations.
[03:26:11.893 --> 03:26:16.736]  Multiple waves will be harassing Secret Service security checkpoints to the National Mall.
[03:26:17.785 --> 03:26:23.106]  Roving protesters in the crowd will be using drums to break up the program.
[03:26:23.947 --> 03:26:26.967]  They intend to launch a pirate radio broadcast.
[03:26:27.988 --> 03:26:32.489]  Drones loaded with rockets to attack the parade are under consideration.
[03:26:33.329 --> 03:26:34.869]  Secret Service, take notice.
[03:26:35.409 --> 03:26:38.330]  Happy to share this with anybody from the service who wants to contact us.
[03:26:39.570 --> 03:26:45.892]  They are going to have roller derby women zooming through the cloud, knocking people over and disturbing order.
[03:26:47.011 --> 03:26:51.534]  Now, January 6th through 8th, they have their street medic training.
[03:26:52.115 --> 03:26:55.137]  January 8th, they have a huge mass meeting to plan this disruption.
[03:26:55.957 --> 03:27:01.201]  January 14th to 16th, they're going to be training their shock troops for violence.
[03:27:02.001 --> 03:27:08.306]  January 14th through 22nd, they converge on Washington in an effort to paralyze the city.
[03:27:09.676 --> 03:27:14.840]  Chinatown and K Street non-profits have been opened for legal and medical assistance.
[03:27:14.860 --> 03:27:16.261]  Those are front organizations.
[03:27:17.622 --> 03:27:32.372]  And the affiliated groups here are Rising Tide North America, these people are behind the Dakota Pipeline protests, Showing Up for Racial Justice, SURJ, and of course the ever popular
[03:27:32.992 --> 03:27:34.392]  Black Lives Matter.
[03:27:35.333 --> 03:27:37.373]  This is the blueprint for disruption.
[03:27:37.914 --> 03:27:40.154]  This is the Alinsky plan.
[03:27:40.174 --> 03:27:42.075]  You're hearing about it here on Infowars.
[03:27:42.915 --> 03:27:48.437]  This is what the forces of repression and censorship have planned.
[03:27:48.977 --> 03:27:55.159]  So we have our own event coming up on January 20th.
[03:27:55.759 --> 03:27:57.120]  It's the Deplora Ball.
[03:27:58.120 --> 03:28:00.901]  Now moved to a much better venue at the National Press Club.
[03:28:02.132 --> 03:28:09.035]  January 20th, this is going to be the non-elite gathering for activists.
[03:28:09.555 --> 03:28:14.057]  This is where the Trump first team is going to go.
[03:28:14.777 --> 03:28:25.162]  So if you are at all planning on coming to Washington during the inauguration, and I urge you to do so because in numbers there is strength.
[03:28:25.802 --> 03:28:29.263]  Well, then I strongly recommend that you buy a ticket to the Deplora Ball.
[03:28:30.064 --> 03:28:31.144]  Alex Jones will be there.
[03:28:31.164 --> 03:28:32.125]  I will be there.
[03:28:32.305 --> 03:28:33.865]  The great Mike Cernovich will be there.
[03:28:34.806 --> 03:28:36.766]  Many other outstanding speakers.
[03:28:37.687 --> 03:28:46.730]  This is the true people's celebration of the inauguration of Donald John Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.
[03:28:47.471 --> 03:28:49.532]  This is going to be a hot ticket.
[03:28:50.192 --> 03:28:54.834]  I know that of a thousand tickets available, 500 plus have already been sold.
[03:28:55.894 --> 03:29:10.601]  So, we are lucky to have some seats available, but folks, move quickly if you want to hear Alex Jones, Roger Stone, Mike Cernovich, and others, and you want to stand up for Donald Trump during these protests to show that we have the proof.
[03:29:16.809 --> 03:29:20.511]  Now let me make one other point, if I may.
[03:29:21.572 --> 03:29:25.675]  We have the Charge Hillary petition at Stone Cold Truth.
[03:29:26.195 --> 03:29:27.136]  I urge you to sign that.
[03:29:27.576 --> 03:29:28.256]  It's important.
[03:29:28.697 --> 03:29:31.158]  It's at chargehillaryclinton.com.
[03:29:31.579 --> 03:29:33.160]  Chargehillaryclinton.com.
[03:29:34.501 --> 03:29:35.662]  I want you to sign up there.
[03:29:36.242 --> 03:29:39.425]  Equally important, Alex Jones's petition on fake news.
[03:29:40.046 --> 03:29:44.630]  This is the single most important fight that we confront in 2017.
[03:29:45.811 --> 03:29:47.413]  It's the effort to silence us.
[03:29:48.173 --> 03:29:51.316]  And InfoWars is leading the campaign.
[03:29:51.716 --> 03:29:53.919]  So thanks for joining me here today on InfoWars.
[03:29:54.459 --> 03:29:55.260]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:55.660 --> 03:29:57.442]  I'm sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:29:59.451 --> 03:30:02.454]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.375 --> 03:30:06.078]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:20.467 --> 03:30:28.383]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[03:30:28.463 --> 03:30:31.549]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[03:30:32.352 --> 03:30:34.212]  And they're also very affordable.
[03:30:56.337 --> 03:31:03.088]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[03:31:03.489 --> 03:31:04.250]  It's a win-win.
[03:31:04.731 --> 03:31:05.492]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:10.800 --> 03:31:21.750]  As reported by the Daily Mail, yet another Russian diplomat is found dead, this one at his home in Moscow just hours after the reports came of the assassination of the Russian ambassador in Ankara, Turkey.
[03:31:21.910 --> 03:31:26.454]  Peter Polshchikov, 56 years old, he was found dead from a gunshot wound in his own home.
[03:31:26.574 --> 03:31:30.538]  He's reported to be a senior figure in Russia for the Latin American Department of
[03:31:30.578 --> 03:31:30.818]  We're good.
[03:31:49.634 --> 03:31:53.397]  But what we do know is that police are examining all possible motives to his death.
[03:31:53.477 --> 03:32:01.803]  Two empty bullet wounds were found in the apartment in Belotsky Prospect and a gun was discovered under the sink in the bathroom as reported by REN TV.
[03:32:01.863 --> 03:32:07.368]  Your latest update on the second assassination of a Russian diplomat in a spate of 48 hours.
[03:32:07.608 --> 03:32:09.970]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:32:10.618 --> 03:32:19.641]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:32:19.701 --> 03:32:27.824]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:32:28.104 --> 03:32:28.364]  We are.
[03:32:57.944 --> 03:32:59.744]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:32:59.824 --> 03:33:00.304]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:34.648 --> 03:33:42.606]  Every time I get a chance, I listen to Roger Stowe or if I was, Roger's a badass MF.
[03:33:45.329 --> 03:33:48.691]  Thank you, that wasn't really the Reverend Al Sharpton, but it sure sounded like him.
[03:33:49.192 --> 03:33:54.395]  Thanks for joining me again on InfoWars, sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:33:55.095 --> 03:34:04.101]  Two terrific appointments that didn't get, that aren't, isn't getting the kind of attention I think it needs, and I think answers the question that there are not
[03:34:04.841 --> 03:34:07.622]  Loyal Trump-ites be appointed to the administration.
[03:34:07.922 --> 03:34:32.628]  One is Monica Crowley, friend of mine of many years, a former top aide to former President Richard Nixon, a young woman who is a terrific writer, a non-globalist, a Trump supporter from the beginning, now going over to essentially be the Director of Information for the National Security Apparatus, and then also I'm very happy to hear about
[03:34:33.228 --> 03:34:37.413]  There she is, stunning, smart, and enormously capable.
[03:34:37.493 --> 03:34:40.557]  This could be one of Donald Trump's greatest hires.
[03:34:41.358 --> 03:34:44.942]  And then the other person, frankly, I'm most excited about is Larry Kudlow.
[03:34:45.748 --> 03:34:54.171]  Larry Kudlow played a central role in the formulation of Donald Trump's economic plan to move this country forward.
[03:34:54.211 --> 03:34:56.412]  He is a proponent of growth.
[03:34:56.912 --> 03:34:59.253]  He is a proponent of cutting the corporate tax rate.
[03:35:00.013 --> 03:35:08.777]  He understands that the same tactics that President John F. Kennedy and President Ronald Reagan used to move the economy forward through tax reduction can work again.
[03:35:09.857 --> 03:35:15.639]  And President Trump should not be talked out of his radical plan to move this economy.
[03:35:16.239 --> 03:35:19.540]  With Larry Kudlow there, I don't believe he will be.
[03:35:20.621 --> 03:35:29.724]  On the downside, I have read about the potential appointment of Richard Haass of the Council on Foreign Relations to the number two position at the State Department.
[03:35:30.404 --> 03:35:33.265]  For a myriad of reasons, I think this is a terrible idea.
[03:35:34.085 --> 03:35:37.847]  Let's keep an eye on that story and see if that really happens.
[03:35:38.288 --> 03:35:44.392]  Now I want to turn to John Haggerty, who joined me several days ago on the Stone Cold Truth Radio Show.
[03:35:45.212 --> 03:35:48.114]  An incredible interview that I really wanted to go into here.
[03:35:49.034 --> 03:35:52.557]  John Haggerty is among the most respected and knowledgeable
[03:35:53.177 --> 03:35:54.318]  Good afternoon, Roger.
[03:35:54.358 --> 03:35:56.779]  It's a pleasure to join you again.
[03:36:16.778 --> 03:36:27.453]  So, lay out for our listeners exactly what happened in Wisconsin, and then give us a taste of Michigan and Pennsylvania, because based on everything I have read...
[03:36:29.136 --> 03:36:39.560]  The Clintonites, with Jill Stein fronting for them, never presented any evidence whatsoever of irregularities or undervotes, overvotes, nothing.
[03:36:40.321 --> 03:36:43.002]  Their entire complaint was based on two incredible arguments.
[03:36:43.642 --> 03:36:45.223]  One, that the machines could be hacked.
[03:36:46.043 --> 03:36:48.684]  When I said that before the election, they tried to crucify me.
[03:36:49.585 --> 03:36:55.827]  And that the polls didn't match the final results, so the final results must be wrong.
[03:36:56.267 --> 03:36:57.348]  Take it away, John Haggerty.
[03:36:58.089 --> 03:36:59.851]  Well, that is correct, Roger.
[03:36:59.891 --> 03:37:01.293]  This was a baseless recount.
[03:37:01.693 --> 03:37:05.777]  And let me give you some background before we go to the specific states.
[03:37:06.238 --> 03:37:11.584]  So even though it's a federal election, state law controls the conduct of elections in each state.
[03:37:11.664 --> 03:37:14.567]  And each state is a little different in how they do things.
[03:37:15.027 --> 03:37:26.458]  So, in Wisconsin, Wisconsin allows for a recount for any candidate if they're willing to pay a fee, and the fee is calculated on the number of votes and what the cost would be.
[03:37:26.838 --> 03:37:34.885]  So Jill Stein paid a fee of about $4 million to have a recount, even though she was the 4th place candidate in Wisconsin.
[03:37:35.586 --> 03:37:38.629]  And she remained the 4th place candidate even after the recount was over.
[03:37:39.252 --> 03:37:56.988]  So what she did was she dragged these hard-working Board of Elections officials, employees, who had just worked four months on a presidential election, and made them come in during the holiday season and spend 12 to 14 hours a day to recount the election in time for the Electoral College.
[03:37:57.708 --> 03:38:02.473]  The election system in Wisconsin is very professional, very professionally run.
[03:38:03.377 --> 03:38:09.319]  Um, and in the end of the day, Donald Trump gained 131 votes and Jill Stein gained about 60 votes.
[03:38:10.260 --> 03:38:20.684]  And to give you an idea, we're talking out of over 3 million votes cast in Wisconsin, which that change translates into .006% change, which is nothing.
[03:38:21.324 --> 03:38:29.427]  So, you know, even though she paid the fee, you know, required taxpayer costs to do this recount,
[03:38:30.203 --> 03:38:32.384]  And it comes out, at the end of the day, to nothing.
[03:38:33.025 --> 03:38:34.345]  They really had no allegations.
[03:38:34.385 --> 03:38:45.571]  This was conjecture and pie-in-the-sky belief, desperation, because they're refusing to accept Donald Trump as the president and that he had won Wisconsin.
[03:38:47.952 --> 03:39:01.140]  Jill Stein's people started this recount, and Hillary's people participated, and it was obvious to us that there was some collusion and coordination going on, but the Democratic officials conducting the election thought it was a waste of time.
[03:39:02.520 --> 03:39:07.263]  So, Wisconsin, the machines really couldn't be hacked in the sense that they're not networked.
[03:39:07.563 --> 03:39:10.245]  These are paper ballots that are scanned by machine.
[03:39:10.785 --> 03:39:16.148]  So, in the end of the day, what this recount did was it proved the accuracy of the system in Wisconsin.
[03:39:16.946 --> 03:39:19.689]  Because there was such a minor, minor change in the numbers.
[03:39:20.090 --> 03:39:25.196]  So basically what you had is, you probably had some ballots that the machine couldn't read or the ink was too light.
[03:39:25.577 --> 03:39:27.859]  But it showed how accurate the system really is.
[03:39:27.959 --> 03:39:32.505]  So in the end of the day, Wisconsin conducted the whole recount really for nothing.
[03:39:33.085 --> 03:39:42.753]  And I hope the one thing Wisconsin does is change their state law so that there has to be some kind of mathematical trigger for candidates to obtain a recount.
[03:39:42.813 --> 03:39:45.154]  Like in New York State, for instance, it's statutory.
[03:39:45.595 --> 03:39:48.857]  Candidates have to be within one-half of one percent to get a recount.
[03:39:48.897 --> 03:39:49.838]  It's not court-ordered.
[03:39:49.898 --> 03:39:50.779]  It's not pay-a-fee.
[03:39:51.259 --> 03:39:53.841]  If it's within one-half of one percent, it's that close.
[03:39:53.881 --> 03:39:55.082]  It's an automatic recount.
[03:39:55.222 --> 03:39:58.845]  And you can't get a recount any other way, and that's probably what they should consider in Wisconsin.
[03:39:59.676 --> 03:40:00.559]  Now let's go to Michigan.
[03:40:01.442 --> 03:40:02.746]  Go ahead Roger, I'm sorry.
[03:40:03.589 --> 03:40:04.492]  Tell us about Michigan.
[03:40:05.080 --> 03:40:06.681]  Yep, let's go to Michigan.
[03:40:06.701 --> 03:40:19.369]  So Michigan, again, there were no specific allegations and what really happened is the recount started for four days until the court stopped it, realizing what a farce it was.
[03:40:19.949 --> 03:40:28.875]  So I was in Wayne County, which is Detroit, and what you really saw in Wayne County and Detroit was irregularities that helped Hillary.
[03:40:28.895 --> 03:40:30.156]  You found that
[03:40:34.161 --> 03:40:43.206]  Thirty-seven percent of the city of Detroit's precincts tabulated more ballots than the number of actual voters that signed in the poll book, which is always an indication that something is wrong.
[03:40:43.867 --> 03:40:46.328]  But this wasn't hacking or postal.
[03:40:46.608 --> 03:40:49.430]  What this was was stuffing the ballot box for Hillary.
[03:40:50.310 --> 03:41:03.458]  And so, the way Michigan state law works is that a precinct cannot be recounted if the number of ballots doesn't equal the number of people in the poll book.
[03:41:04.048 --> 03:41:07.829]  Because if there's more ballots than people in the poll book, that means someone added ballots in afterwards.
[03:41:08.410 --> 03:41:12.531]  And these are all precincts where Hillary won 90-95%.
[03:41:13.151 --> 03:41:16.432]  So, the way Michigan state law is, is that it can't be recounted.
[03:41:16.452 --> 03:41:19.273]  That the election results on election night stand.
[03:41:19.353 --> 03:41:20.614]  And that's what happened in Michigan.
[03:41:21.218 --> 03:41:37.746]  The state court ruled that Jill Stein had no ability to bring this proceeding, that she was not an aggrieved candidate in any way, that it wasn't possible for her to win, and that she offered absolutely no proof to the court or the boards of election that something had happened.
[03:41:38.567 --> 03:41:41.028]  She was trying to make assumptions, and in fact,
[03:41:41.768 --> 03:41:54.754]  What will come out of this now is the State Board of Elections will conduct an audit onto Wayne County to see if it was human error, or if it was actual fraud, or negligence for the mismatched irregularities in Detroit.
[03:41:55.275 --> 03:42:04.279]  And very often, you know, in presidential elections with a lot of ballots, you have Election Day workers who work long hours and are poorly trained, and they make a mess of it.
[03:42:04.719 --> 03:42:06.620]  And pretty much that's what happened in Detroit.
[03:42:08.124 --> 03:42:15.466]  But again, no one was hacking any machines, no one was doing anything except maybe stuffing the ballot box a little bit, but again, in Hillary's favor.
[03:42:15.506 --> 03:42:18.427]  So in the end of the day, again, Donald Trump won Michigan.
[03:42:19.827 --> 03:42:23.889]  All right, so the big three in their trifecta was Pennsylvania.
[03:42:23.909 --> 03:42:25.969]  A little more complicated, but tell us about that.
[03:42:26.549 --> 03:42:26.729]  Yep.
[03:42:26.869 --> 03:42:35.292]  Well, Pennsylvania, again, Trump beat Clinton at about 44,000 votes out of 6 million cast, or less than 1%.
[03:42:36.567 --> 03:42:43.670]  So, again, what they did was, again, Pennsylvania state law is different than Michigan or Wisconsin.
[03:42:44.190 --> 03:42:50.792]  They allowed them to take a random sampling of some districts to see if there were irregularities.
[03:42:51.352 --> 03:42:56.474]  And then if there are irregularities or there are issues, then a court can allow a fuller recount.
[03:42:56.994 --> 03:42:59.175]  But they weren't able to show any irregularities.
[03:42:59.275 --> 03:43:04.337]  They weren't able to show anything that mattered that a recount should be conducted.
[03:43:04.918 --> 03:43:11.103]  So, when it came time to put up or shut up, the Jill Stein people, in some ways the Hillary people, couldn't prove anything.
[03:43:11.123 --> 03:43:18.028]  You know, the judge actually called the suspicion of a hacked Pennsylvania election, borders on the irrational.
[03:43:19.009 --> 03:43:33.981]  And this whole thing was designed, it's really ironic that Jill Stein and also Hillary Clinton, and we actually created the term Clinton Stein in Wisconsin, we would call it the Clinton Stein recount, that
[03:43:35.389 --> 03:43:40.293]  That all they wanted to do was prevent these states from participating in the Electoral College.
[03:43:40.613 --> 03:43:41.234]  That's what it was.
[03:43:41.294 --> 03:43:50.061]  It was actually to deprive voters in these states of their ability as a state to conduct their votes at the Electoral College.
[03:43:50.101 --> 03:43:56.207]  So it's total hypocrisy on their part, because this wasn't — Jill Stein supporters knew they were never going to win anything.
[03:43:56.247 --> 03:44:01.251]  They just wanted to muck up the process and to try and cost Donald Trump electoral votes.
[03:44:01.271 --> 03:44:01.952]  And it's a shame.
[03:44:03.026 --> 03:44:10.248]  The good part is, in Wisconsin, the recount was conducted and finished on time so the Electoral College could vote.
[03:44:10.388 --> 03:44:14.648]  In Michigan, the courts, both federal and state courts, put an end to it, and the Board of Canvases did.
[03:44:15.049 --> 03:44:18.669]  And in Pennsylvania, the court didn't buy, didn't take the bait from Jill Stein.
[03:44:19.209 --> 03:44:20.990]  So the good part is that the process worked.
[03:44:21.630 --> 03:44:27.971]  If you look since 2000, the Bush-Gore recount, many changes have been made in the election system.
[03:44:28.891 --> 03:44:32.292]  There's only been a very handful of close, big elections.
[03:44:33.147 --> 03:44:40.393]  And those handful you're talking about after a recount were decided by less than three or four hundred votes.
[03:44:40.953 --> 03:44:47.919]  In all of these states you're talking tens of thousands of votes margin, yet we're still having recounts when everybody knows nothing is going to change.
[03:44:48.339 --> 03:44:58.167]  So the good part about these recounts is they showed that the improvements made to the election system after Bush-Gore have actually worked and made the election system better,
[03:44:59.023 --> 03:45:04.345]  And when they talk about Russian hacking, the Russian hacking is into campaign emails, John Podesta's emails.
[03:45:04.846 --> 03:45:08.427]  The election systems themselves are really not connected to the internet.
[03:45:10.028 --> 03:45:13.569]  And what these systems do is actually count paper ballots.
[03:45:13.670 --> 03:45:14.690]  They're scanning paper ballots.
[03:45:14.730 --> 03:45:19.112]  So in a situation where there was some question, you could go back and count the paper ballots.
[03:45:20.838 --> 03:45:25.060]  Even the proof that the Russians were hacking emails is thin, to say the least.
[03:45:25.120 --> 03:45:33.824]  We now know definitively that the famous DNC emails and internal documents came from a leaker, not from the Russians.
[03:45:33.844 --> 03:45:37.506]  I mean, it's time to put that canard to bed.
[03:45:37.586 --> 03:45:48.731]  As you know, John, six Democratic parties sued Donald Trump and I in federal court, arguing that we had a massive plan to intimidate minority voters at the polling places.
[03:45:49.884 --> 03:45:51.146]  I don't know.
[03:46:06.883 --> 03:46:12.611]  We had to go into court simultaneously in six states on the same day.
[03:46:12.651 --> 03:46:14.354]  That's six different sets of lawyers.
[03:46:15.135 --> 03:46:17.057]  We are still paying off a legal debt.
[03:46:17.098 --> 03:46:20.202]  If you want to help, you can go to StopTheSteal.org.
[03:46:22.004 --> 03:46:23.225]  We have a small debt there.
[03:46:23.785 --> 03:46:45.977]  We intend to pay everybody and all of our lawyers because these folks did yeoman service and our election day operations were unimpeded after the court spoke long and clear saying that Donald Trump and Roger Stone had no plan to intimidate or otherwise harass minority voters or anyone else.
[03:46:48.439 --> 03:46:51.041]  Let me take a quick break here, and we'll come back to John Haggerty.
[03:46:51.722 --> 03:47:05.213]  I want to remind folks that Christmas will be upon us here shortly, and the Infowars.com store has some amazing products at slash prices for this particular Christmas.
[03:47:06.214 --> 03:47:10.337]  The new Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is $9.95.
[03:47:10.617 --> 03:47:11.378]  It's a deep discount.
[03:47:14.180 --> 03:47:23.709]  This stuff has been successfully researched across the board, and it doesn't have fluoride, which has many reported drawbacks.
[03:47:23.769 --> 03:47:36.500]  This is a pure, effective, naturally-based toothpaste, and if you are, like me, an occasional cigar smoker, you need this product.
[03:47:37.561 --> 03:47:46.587]  This has peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver, and several other proprietary ingredients that make this an absolute bargain.
[03:47:46.627 --> 03:47:56.694]  So for this Christmas, for your stocking, jump over to the InfoWars.com store as soon as we are finished and load up on this terrific product.
[03:47:57.174 --> 03:47:59.276]  You can also get Brain Force.
[03:47:59.816 --> 03:48:02.578]  You can get a number of other fine products.
[03:48:02.638 --> 03:48:06.821]  And of course, the Trump Is My President t-shirt we spoke to about later.
[03:48:08.823 --> 03:48:10.985]  So, John Haggerty, back to you.
[03:48:11.606 --> 03:48:14.649]  What is your feeling about the Trump cabinet?
[03:48:14.730 --> 03:48:21.337]  I know that you are a long-time Republican activist in New York and that you were early Trump.
[03:48:23.039 --> 03:48:24.841]  How do you see the early appointments?
[03:48:25.522 --> 03:48:26.703]  Oh, I think it's great.
[03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:39.579]  Most Republicans I know and Trump supporters I know that aren't Republicans are very enthusiastic that he is keeping his word and picking people from outside the establishment or outside of the box.
[03:48:40.079 --> 03:48:45.403]  I mean, you look at the quality of the military people he selected to serve in his cabinet.
[03:48:45.443 --> 03:48:47.665]  They're incredible people.
[03:48:48.406 --> 03:48:52.209]  You look at the business experience of many of the business people.
[03:48:52.689 --> 03:48:54.311]  This is outside experience.
[03:48:54.371 --> 03:48:56.052]  This is common sense.
[03:48:56.690 --> 03:48:59.131]  Every day management type experience.
[03:48:59.191 --> 03:49:03.833]  It's not bureaucratic, politicians, insider Washington type people.
[03:49:03.873 --> 03:49:06.553]  And that's what I think the voters wanted.
[03:49:07.134 --> 03:49:10.975]  That's what they want, this type of experience.
[03:49:14.635 --> 03:49:15.756]  I'm in agreement, John.
[03:49:15.896 --> 03:49:21.099]  I think that the appointment of Rick Perry to Energy is a perfect fit.
[03:49:22.059 --> 03:49:23.680]  I've long been a fan of Rick Perry.
[03:49:23.720 --> 03:49:30.364]  He has a tremendous record on energy issues and job creation in Texas, and I think this is the right job for him.
[03:49:31.164 --> 03:49:36.288]  Trump letting bygones be bygones with a real conservative and putting him on the team, I think is a great appointment.
[03:49:36.788 --> 03:49:45.195]  Larry Kudlow, as I indicated, which I believe is in the pipeline, is the chairman of the Council on Economic Advisers, would be an excellent appointment.
[03:49:45.615 --> 03:49:58.525]  Monica Crowley, a superb appointment, an old pal of mine from the Nixon days, an exceptionally able person, a non-globalist, a nationalist, someone who gets the big picture.
[03:49:59.645 --> 03:50:01.506]  I'm very happy about Linda McMahon.
[03:50:01.546 --> 03:50:03.627]  This is somebody who's actually run a business.
[03:50:04.208 --> 03:50:13.453]  She's ideal for SBA, where I think the Trump administration really needs to put a giant effort on small business and minority business enterprise.
[03:50:14.433 --> 03:50:17.636]  Steve Mnuchin, I think is a reflection of Trump.
[03:50:18.216 --> 03:50:20.098]  Doesn't bother me that he was once at Goldman.
[03:50:20.438 --> 03:50:22.740]  Doesn't bother me that Bannon was once at Goldman.
[03:50:23.201 --> 03:50:26.563]  Doesn't bother me that this fellow Gary Cohn was once at Goldman.
[03:50:27.044 --> 03:50:28.185]  Trump has made this clear.
[03:50:28.485 --> 03:50:29.285]  It's his agenda.
[03:50:30.006 --> 03:50:33.228]  The people at Goldman Sachs have some enormously capable people.
[03:50:33.728 --> 03:50:40.553]  But make no mistake about it, the agenda is the Trump agenda, not the Goldman Sachs agenda.
[03:50:40.673 --> 03:50:42.955]  Of that, I am most confident.
[03:50:43.795 --> 03:50:49.179]  So, John Hagerty, thanks for joining us here at the Stone Cold Truth.
[03:50:50.019 --> 03:50:58.725]  We're going to talk in the last segment about Mr. Stone's international best-dressed list, which will be out January 1st, and you're never going to guess who's on it.
[03:50:59.919 --> 03:51:00.444]  Thanks, Roger.
[03:51:00.485 --> 03:51:01.112]  Merry Christmas.
[03:51:14.932 --> 03:51:18.393]  What is front and center on your radar screen?
[03:51:18.953 --> 03:51:19.353]  Fake news.
[03:51:19.753 --> 03:51:20.674]  Fake news is number one.
[03:51:20.694 --> 03:51:24.195]  The No Agenda Show is the podcast that I do.
[03:51:25.235 --> 03:51:34.657]  We've been tracking this for a long time and feel that this is now the opportune moment, especially in connection with Pizzagate, which is being used as, you know, it's dangerous.
[03:51:34.977 --> 03:51:36.498]  So licensing is on its way.
[03:51:36.558 --> 03:51:39.079]  Licensing of journalists, licensing of all kinds of things.
[03:51:39.179 --> 03:51:41.099]  That's what we really believe is going to happen.
[03:51:41.439 --> 03:51:43.960]  And then you're the accepted group because you toe the line.
[03:51:44.660 --> 03:51:46.301]  Yeah, that's how China does it.
[03:51:46.341 --> 03:51:50.122]  They license journalists, and even when they get out of line, they arrest you for fake news.
[03:51:50.423 --> 03:51:51.683]  That's a big, big truth bomb.
[03:51:51.723 --> 03:51:52.423]  I hadn't thought of that.
[03:51:52.503 --> 03:51:53.944]  Right, they are going to push licensing.
[03:51:53.964 --> 03:51:55.245]  Well, of course they are.
[03:51:55.265 --> 03:51:56.765]  I mean, this is happening in Europe.
[03:51:56.845 --> 03:52:11.551]  The European Parliament just passed a resolution, and this is all about fake news, and the whole idea is to fund journalists with education, fund NGOs, to really... And to create lists to block off our sites.
[03:52:11.591 --> 03:52:12.412]  It's already happening to us.
[03:52:12.892 --> 03:52:13.252]  Of course it is.
[03:52:13.272 --> 03:52:14.173]  By the way, let's say it.
[03:52:14.493 --> 03:52:16.374]  That's what Matt Drudge came here a year ago and said.
[03:52:16.715 --> 03:52:18.156]  That's what he always hypes on.
[03:52:18.176 --> 03:52:20.337]  He said, stop being on Facebook and Twitter.
[03:52:20.357 --> 03:52:21.478]  They're going to end up censoring you.
[03:52:21.818 --> 03:52:23.840]  Build your own platform.
[03:52:24.380 --> 03:52:26.341]  Everybody go to websites again.
[03:52:26.381 --> 03:52:30.124]  Have lots of independent things, like lots of little independent shops and restaurants.
[03:52:30.144 --> 03:52:30.764]  It's the same thing.
[03:52:31.025 --> 03:52:32.125]  Not big box stores.
[03:52:32.546 --> 03:52:36.368]  It's undeniable now when we see a president like Trump.
[03:52:36.428 --> 03:52:37.689]  We see what happened with Brexit.
[03:52:37.709 --> 03:52:38.890]  We see what's happening with Italy.
[03:52:40.331 --> 03:52:45.532]  I think these types of platforms, alternative to the mainstream, is more important than ever right now.
[03:52:46.532 --> 03:52:48.633]  And people are definitely finding it.
[03:52:48.653 --> 03:52:50.853]  Facebook is kind of becoming a graveyard in a way.
[03:52:50.913 --> 03:52:56.715]  I mean, I have to have an account just to see what's going on, but I really... Well, I famously said I use it like a toilet.
[03:52:57.695 --> 03:52:59.955]  I mean, I don't expect it to always be there.
[03:52:59.975 --> 03:53:04.036]  And it's just kind of like a hole in the ground out back, you know, at the farmhouse.
[03:53:04.476 --> 03:53:07.217]  But we put our info out there, but we don't expect it to be there tomorrow.
[03:53:08.304 --> 03:53:09.325]  It may very well not be.
[03:53:09.345 --> 03:53:11.547]  I mean, online communities always end up broken.
[03:53:11.687 --> 03:53:12.608]  They always, I mean, we've seen it.
[03:53:12.648 --> 03:53:15.030]  GeoCities, AOL, eventually it'll go away.
[03:53:15.710 --> 03:53:23.316]  As we're leading up to the election, you know, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO, and his connections in Washington, we're helping to filter news.
[03:53:23.837 --> 03:53:31.583]  Oh, he was already censoring massively, and then after Hillary lost, the media said, the Donald Trump media, it's your fault, you didn't censor more, and so now he's doing it.
[03:53:32.263 --> 03:53:32.463]  Right.
[03:53:32.683 --> 03:53:35.244]  Well, this is the epic battle that's taking place.
[03:53:35.264 --> 03:53:39.726]  It's mainstream media who, just like the record business, for years, denied, denied, denied.
[03:53:40.347 --> 03:53:43.508]  Now, if you sell 2,000 records, you're top 10 on Billboard.
[03:53:43.548 --> 03:53:44.488]  That's how bad it is.
[03:53:44.548 --> 03:53:44.729]  Wow.
[03:53:45.029 --> 03:53:46.389]  It's that bad.
[03:53:47.010 --> 03:53:49.090]  Wow, I can put out an album and sell 100,000.
[03:53:49.471 --> 03:53:51.091]  You get platinum status.
[03:53:52.212 --> 03:53:53.272]  Alex Jones' Christmas record.
[03:53:53.392 --> 03:53:54.553]  I would definitely buy that.
[03:53:54.653 --> 03:53:59.495]  The Jingle Bells, The Lonely Soldier, Mama Stole My Christmas Tree, all the classics.
[03:54:01.266 --> 03:54:01.809]  I want to do it.
[03:54:01.829 --> 03:54:02.853]  Let's do it.
[03:54:03.194 --> 03:54:05.503]  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.
[03:54:05.524 --> 03:54:06.327]  That's it, that's it.
[03:54:28.925 --> 03:54:30.846]  Well, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:54:31.487 --> 03:54:35.109]  You're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[03:54:39.532 --> 03:54:40.073]  There you go.
[03:54:40.193 --> 03:54:43.195]  Thank you, President Richard Milhouse Nixon.
[03:54:45.100 --> 03:54:48.902]  Privilege for me to be here sitting in for Alex Jones on InfoWars.
[03:54:49.563 --> 03:54:50.463]  Great show today.
[03:54:50.523 --> 03:54:55.426]  John Hagerty told us the truth about the Wisconsin recount.
[03:54:55.786 --> 03:55:07.733]  Jacob Engels filled us in on the attempts of censorship of the families whose loved ones died in the Pulse nightclub attack by Islamic terrorists.
[03:55:08.553 --> 03:55:13.556]  And of course the latest on the key Trump appointments.
[03:55:15.191 --> 03:55:28.862]  It's no secret to my friends that I am hunkered down in Florida, working furiously to finish the manuscript for The Making of the President 2016, How Donald Trump Orchestrated an American Revolution.
[03:55:29.683 --> 03:55:43.935]  Now folks, this book is blunt, it is factual, it is documented, it is historic, and it is revelatory in terms of how Donald Trump
[03:55:44.966 --> 03:55:52.768]  With the assistance of the alternative media, pulled off the greatest upset victory in US political history.
[03:55:53.928 --> 03:55:58.630]  So you can go to amazon.com, you can go to Barnes & Noble.
[03:55:59.350 --> 03:56:04.311]  Shortly, I believe you'll be able to go to infowars.com to get a great price on this book.
[03:56:05.211 --> 03:56:06.752]  You can go to the Stone Cold Truth.
[03:56:08.392 --> 03:56:13.774]  I want to make sure that the mainstream media cannot ignore this book, cannot ignore the truth.
[03:56:14.594 --> 03:56:30.020]  This is going to have a lot of revelations about Hillary Clinton, things you still didn't know, things that you will find outrageous and incredible, and how Donald Trump had the instincts and the guile and the cojones to face down the entire media establishment
[03:56:30.800 --> 03:56:31.641]  And grab the U.S.
[03:56:31.701 --> 03:56:32.321]  Presidency.
[03:56:33.102 --> 03:56:33.523]  And how?
[03:56:34.203 --> 03:56:37.306]  To this day, they will not let him have his victory.
[03:56:38.006 --> 03:56:49.497]  They seek to delegitimize his presidency with phony recounts, with assaults on electors, with stories calling for his impeachment in New York Magazine.
[03:56:50.277 --> 03:56:51.678]  That's what we're talking about.
[03:56:51.799 --> 03:56:57.303]  So I urge you to get this book now if you are
[03:56:58.945 --> 03:57:00.646]  Looking for additional Christmas presents?
[03:57:00.726 --> 03:57:04.908]  The Infowars.com store still has copies of the Clinton's War on Women.
[03:57:05.568 --> 03:57:08.170]  This is the definitive package on the Clintons.
[03:57:08.790 --> 03:57:12.552]  Still relevant because it's clear to me the Clintons have not decided to go away.
[03:57:13.632 --> 03:57:17.854]  Bill Clinton is making every excuse in the book as to why his wife lost.
[03:57:17.994 --> 03:57:19.515]  Oh, it was James Comey's fault.
[03:57:19.635 --> 03:57:21.216]  No, it was Hillary's fault.
[03:57:21.976 --> 03:57:23.237]  The people didn't want her.
[03:57:23.597 --> 03:57:24.517]  They don't like her.
[03:57:24.798 --> 03:57:27.219]  They don't like her record and she had no proposals.
[03:57:28.211 --> 03:57:44.105]  So you can still grab your Hillary for Prison 2016 t-shirts at Info Wars, pardon me, 2017 t-shirts at Info Wars and Stone Cold Truth, because this fight, this fight is going into the new year.
[03:57:44.665 --> 03:57:47.768]  This fight is far, far from over.
[03:57:48.549 --> 03:57:51.471]  And you are going to want to be in the vanguard of this movement.
[03:57:52.312 --> 03:57:53.913]  And if you're coming to the inauguration,
[03:57:54.895 --> 03:57:59.900]  And you're not wearing a Trump is my President t-shirt from the Infowars store?
[03:58:00.641 --> 03:58:03.523]  Well then you better be wearing a Hillary for Prison 2017.
[03:58:04.184 --> 03:58:07.407]  Because those will be de rigueur.
[03:58:08.382 --> 03:58:09.422]  In Washington, D.C.
[03:58:10.002 --> 03:58:14.564]  This is what the cool people will be wearing.
[03:58:15.084 --> 03:58:21.485]  So join me in Washington for the inauguration, for the Deplora Ball, and get your T-shirt today from InfoWars.
[03:58:21.905 --> 03:58:25.726]  Roger Stone, with many thanks, signing off for InfoWars.
[03:58:50.535 --> 03:58:52.377]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:54.059 --> 03:58:57.603]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:59:00.426 --> 03:59:07.794]  Social media platforms are coming under fire as families of the Orlando nightclub shooting victims are suing Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
[03:59:07.914 --> 03:59:14.721]  And the federal complaint argues that these web platforms quote provided terrorist group support for ISIS and the accounts they used to
