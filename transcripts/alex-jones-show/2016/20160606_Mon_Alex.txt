[00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:16.542]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:16.922 --> 00:00:19.223]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:27.447]  I am live in studio coming to you from deep in the heart of the good old state of Texas, Austin.
[00:00:27.907 --> 00:00:29.868]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:30.508 --> 00:00:34.651]  David Knight will anchor at the fourth hour again under host Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:37.172]  Hard to believe it's already Monday, the sixth day of June 2016.
[00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:43.750]  We have several very informative guests joining us today.
[00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.394]  Rob Dew is in Deutschland to cover Bilderberg 2016, the global government meeting.
[00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:56.579]  Every four years, since its inception, every fourth year meets in the United States on the East Coast.
[00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:58.520]  This is the first time they are meeting.
[00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:07.122]  In Europe on the fourth year, and that's obviously because Europe is in such crisis and world government is tottering on the edge of collapse.
[00:01:07.162 --> 00:01:11.925]  It wants to collapse our civilization, but exempt itself, but it's getting the blame.
[00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.007]  It's not able to pose as the savior.
[00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:19.310]  And so this great crisis is starting to go to waste.
[00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:24.282]  And Rob Dew, along with Josh Owens, are on the ground.
[00:01:24.862 --> 00:01:27.204]  Paul Watson is now traveling to Germany as well.
[00:01:27.264 --> 00:01:30.166]  But Bilderberg doesn't kick off until Thursday.
[00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:34.509]  They're obviously going to be covering the grounds of the hotel before they get thrown out.
[00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:39.072]  They're going to be getting intel out to the public about one of these world government shadow meetings.
[00:01:39.672 --> 00:01:41.314]  This is the very pinnacle of control.
[00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:46.747]  But just as important, they're going to be showing the project of the globalist.
[00:01:47.448 --> 00:01:53.370]  Opening the borders, advertising that you can come to Germany, advertising that you can come to Europe and have everything paid for.
[00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.831]  That's part of the EU-admitted program.
[00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:59.792]  They're going to the so-called refugee centers.
[00:02:00.712 --> 00:02:05.874]  And the German police and security showed up, we have the video of this, and said, listen,
[00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.872]  You are not allowed to show this camp without permission.
[00:02:11.392 --> 00:02:29.783]  So certainly no free speech in Germany where they're arresting people for the First Amendment-style rights that we have here that they supposedly have over there but don't, where they are arresting people across the board to even mildly criticize the open borders.
[00:02:30.543 --> 00:02:36.267]  And so here you can see our crew at the entrance to the camp, if you're watching on TV, being pushed out by the security.
[00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:59.309]  And I've had members of the UK Parliament on who are liberals, who have pointed out that what they're doing EU-wide, including the UK, is getting the immigrants that came in maybe five, ten years before, that have been inducted into government service, and that they are now the informants, they are now the enforcers, they are now the controllers.
[00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.072]  And you notice that it appears to be
[00:03:04.978 --> 00:03:11.023]  Africans, not in Muslim garb, who are the security for the Muslims.
[00:03:11.623 --> 00:03:18.408]  And then it'll be the Muslims that are the security for the Chinese or the whatever next group they bring in.
[00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:24.913]  This is a real admitted pattern where the social workers, the police, you name it, are not from the UK.
[00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:27.121]  Are not from Germany.
[00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:33.183]  And I don't mean you have some people in every police department to reflect the makeup of the nation.
[00:03:33.203 --> 00:03:38.045]  That only makes sense to be able to communicate with those communities and to make sure they get integrated into society.
[00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:39.566]  They don't want a melting pot.
[00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:45.768]  They want balkanized groups with basically social workers that come and take your children.
[00:03:46.428 --> 00:03:49.089]  Now, in the UK, it's mainly Eastern Europeans.
[00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.370]  And I'm not bashing Eastern Europeans, you know, they're great folks.
[00:03:52.369 --> 00:04:08.484]  But a lot of them have come out of socialist and communist and authoritarian societies and most the social workers in the UK that come and take your children, I've had members of parliament on that have written articles for London Telegraph and you name it about this, are not even really from the UK.
[00:04:08.504 --> 00:04:09.965]  They hardly even speak English.
[00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:18.273]  And an alarming number of the police chiefs in Sweden, in Germany, in France and in the UK are also
[00:04:19.921 --> 00:04:22.943]  Muslims, and they hardly even speak English.
[00:04:22.983 --> 00:04:26.765]  They weren't even born in the UK, but they're now your enforcer.
[00:04:27.065 --> 00:04:42.012]  In fact, this was pointed out that most of the security at the De Gaulle Airport, Charles De Gaulle Airport there in Paris, are Muslims, and full hardcore practicing Muslims with hajibs.
[00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:44.374]  The women are, you know, there with
[00:04:45.194 --> 00:04:50.658]  Only their eyes showing and they're running security and then up goes the plane and it blows up.
[00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:59.984]  Same thing in Cairo, but of course that's a Muslim country, but they've got the radical Muslims there running it to a certain extent as well.
[00:05:00.524 --> 00:05:06.368]  This is the fox guarding the foxes entering the hen house and the hens are being tied up and having their blood sucked.
[00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:07.069]  We'll be back.
[00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:13.755]  I've been covering the news on radio and TV for more than 21 years.
[00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:22.020]  And as each year begins, you tend to see a theme that's developing with the social engineers, with the global architects.
[00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:29.405]  And undoubtedly, they're making their move to destabilize the Western world right now, from Australia to Europe to the United States to Canada.
[00:05:29.645 --> 00:05:30.446]  And they're bringing in
[00:05:30.726 --> 00:05:37.030]  Millions and millions of radical Islamic Muslims, unvetted, so that they will carry out terror attacks.
[00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:44.294]  And when they do carry out terror attacks, we lose our liberties and freedoms, and are told to comply with Islam, and they'll stop bombing and shooting us.
[00:05:44.554 --> 00:05:46.576]  This is the crazy world of political correctness.
[00:05:47.136 --> 00:05:55.580]  That said, they allow Muslims to basically, in the United States and Europe, keep women as slaves chained up, beat them, pour acid on their faces, and they don't even really get in trouble.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.202]  It's like UN diplomats are always being caught with slaves from Africa and stuff.
[00:05:59.222 --> 00:06:02.263]  And they'll say, well that's their culture in this African country.
[00:06:02.443 --> 00:06:05.204]  But if it's Western culture, it's evil and it's bad.
[00:06:05.805 --> 00:06:12.948]  And going over some of these articles, recently the Pope and the top imam, the head imam in the world over Sunni Muslims, that's what Al-Qaeda is.
[00:06:13.308 --> 00:06:17.193]  Met with the Pope at the Vatican and you've got all this going on for the first time ever.
[00:06:17.494 --> 00:06:29.870]  When the Pope came out in a major Catholic newspaper, LaCroix said that he dreads talking about Christian roots of Europe and colonialist overtones and Jesus was like ISIS sending people out in the fields.
[00:06:30.962 --> 00:06:38.610]  The four corners of the earth and that we must have the Muslims breathe with us and that they're our new culture and this is what we deserve because we've been bad.
[00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.034]  This is freakazoid to be told white people are bad, you're bad.
[00:06:42.054 --> 00:06:47.239]  I mean this is what multiculturalism leads into with the supposed leader of Christendom saying this.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.684]  With Islamic State saying target the US, target Europe, start bombing us.
[00:07:02.108 --> 00:07:02.788]  Incredible threat.
[00:07:02.828 --> 00:07:06.910]  Now ISIS wants to attack the Olympics coming up in Brazil.
[00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.931]  Hungary's Prime Minister gets it and says Clinton is George Soros' puppet.
[00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:16.193]  Warns that they want to overrun the EU with millions of Muslims.
[00:07:16.733 --> 00:07:20.995]  Radical ones that are wedded to the left.
[00:07:21.155 --> 00:07:26.577]  22% of resettled refugees in Minnesota have tested positive for tuberculosis and then they go on to report
[00:07:27.217 --> 00:07:30.018]  That they're letting them in when they have tuberculosis.
[00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:32.940]  This is unprecedented attack on our country.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.461]  This is a government at war with the people.
[00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:38.983]  This is a government savaging the population, and it goes on and on.
[00:07:39.243 --> 00:07:46.446]  The open borders are the key to globalism, destroyed national sovereignty, and radical Islamists that can't even live with each other in peace are not compatible here.
[00:07:46.927 --> 00:07:47.267]  Period.
[00:07:47.727 --> 00:07:51.349]  We shouldn't have to submit to their backwards culture of oppression.
[00:07:52.029 --> 00:08:04.126]  We are the true liberals who promote free speech across the board in Europe and the United States and Canada, and we must stand for it and not be bullied into a new dark age of oppression and tyranny.
[00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:11.291]  We've got it.
[00:08:11.311 --> 00:08:17.773]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:17.833 --> 00:08:19.914]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:22.215 --> 00:08:27.837]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:35.332 --> 00:08:43.935]  This controversy started about a week ago, and I never even covered it, despite the fact that Infowars.com is at the center of it.
[00:08:45.515 --> 00:08:56.699]  And I'll be honest with you, I have a real blind spot to news that we are the center of, because I don't want to just be a gonzo journalist and report on myself.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:06.027]  Even though every day we are reporting on some big news story that InfoWars.com, myself and my reporters are related to.
[00:09:06.748 --> 00:09:19.180]  If we wanted to, we could fill InfoWars every day and this radio show and this TV broadcast with news stories that are about us or about stories we're breaking.
[00:09:20.356 --> 00:09:23.118]  In fact, sometimes it's obnoxious how much we talk about ourselves to begin with.
[00:09:23.158 --> 00:09:29.381]  But when you are on the leading, cutting edge of things, you've got to discuss it because you have to respond to the attacks.
[00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:35.745]  You also have to respond and point out how new independent media is so much more prolific, successful.
[00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:39.811]  And fast moving than the dinosaur media that's on its last legs.
[00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:49.578]  But coming up at the bottom of the hour, I will spend a few minutes on this whole Klamath Falls, Southern Oregon, Northern California controversy.
[00:09:50.078 --> 00:09:58.744]  And it's a synthetic controversy with headlines all over the news and on TV the last week that Donald Trump
[00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:28.350]  He has been caught red-handed using Infowars materiel, and he's a total kook, saying that there is an invasive species fish in several major reservoirs that were built to supply water to farmers in Northern California and Southern Oregon.
[00:10:30.373 --> 00:10:39.998]  And you could do an entire college education course on media manipulation and deception just off of this.
[00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:44.821]  From the photos they use, the images, how they twist it, how they lie.
[00:10:45.522 --> 00:10:55.067]  It's admitted this fish is invasive, but then they say we don't want it to die, so we're not going to let you lower the level of these reservoirs.
[00:10:56.275 --> 00:11:05.068]  It's true that that's what's caused much of the businesses to go out of business and the towns that service the farmers to go out of business.
[00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:10.796]  And it's a fact that there's a federal project to push people off their land all over the United States.
[00:11:11.016 --> 00:11:11.897]  Look at the Red River.
[00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:21.282]  We're thousands of square miles on both sides of Texas and Oklahoma with people in some cases that have had the land for over 100 years.
[00:11:21.522 --> 00:11:27.484]  It's not like it's public land that they have grazing rights to for a hundred and something years like the Bundy's surface rights.
[00:11:27.764 --> 00:11:29.525]  They own the alloidal title.
[00:11:31.645 --> 00:11:33.826]  Some of these families have the old ancient title.
[00:11:37.307 --> 00:11:38.708]  And so all we do
[00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.091]  is point out the fact that all of this is going on.
[00:11:43.331 --> 00:11:43.832]  Thank you, Nico.
[00:11:45.532 --> 00:11:52.095]  And then they think their viewers and listeners are so stupid, they go out and lie and say Donald Trump's discredited.
[00:11:52.415 --> 00:11:54.235]  He linked to InfoWars.com.
[00:11:54.696 --> 00:12:03.739]  And they do that not to actually act like he's discredited, but to make people think InfoWars is discredited because it's actually hitting right on the zeitgeist.
[00:12:05.782 --> 00:12:12.286]  And so they're saying, oh look, ha ha ha, you know, you're talking about something that doesn't exist because they think you're stupid.
[00:12:13.207 --> 00:12:29.718]  And don't remember a decade ago, right through to about two or three years ago, Sean Hannity was there every couple months, Bill O'Reilly, we've been out there repeatedly in areas of Southern Oregon, Northern California, showing the towns
[00:12:30.498 --> 00:12:46.332]  Going from 5-10,000 to a couple hundred and imploding and going out of business because they were based on the reservoirs, the lakes, the mountain lakes that were built in the 40s and 50s to be able to settle that area.
[00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:55.920]  But there's this whole rewilding about tearing down the dams and having things go back to nature and then all we do is report on what's happening
[00:12:57.216 --> 00:13:01.159]  And they come out and say it's a hoax and that Donald Trump is crazy.
[00:13:04.502 --> 00:13:06.364]  And then they link to our stories that Trump.
[00:13:07.378 --> 00:13:13.683]  Link to and that Trump tweeted to act like he somehow did something wrong because they're scared to death.
[00:13:13.903 --> 00:13:16.385]  He's already so radical compared to the establishment.
[00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:17.866]  That's what why he's winning.
[00:13:18.366 --> 00:13:27.393]  What if he really gets radical and picks up the entire InfoWars agenda, which is just one of the most fact based on target worldviews out there?
[00:13:28.694 --> 00:13:30.516]  Quite frankly, nothing even that special.
[00:13:33.607 --> 00:13:37.550]  It's like a person that has 20-20 vision versus someone who's blind.
[00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:40.152]  We understand what we're talking about.
[00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:43.535]  So, they sit there and say it's a drought in California.
[00:13:44.776 --> 00:13:46.117]  That's what's causing the problem.
[00:13:46.137 --> 00:13:47.398]  Yes, we know there's a drought.
[00:13:47.699 --> 00:13:51.602]  California's always had many areas that are arid and desert-like.
[00:13:52.142 --> 00:14:02.251]  That's why we use artificial systems to green it, so that during the drought periods, the communities have a backup plan and aren't a one-crop economy.
[00:14:03.697 --> 00:14:14.228]  That's why they built dams on the Colorado River here in Austin, Texas, to help create a lush water system to supply the two million people that now live here.
[00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:20.415]  And when they built that dam, guess how many people lived in all of this area of Central Texas in this county?
[00:14:21.136 --> 00:14:21.316]  About 40,000.
[00:14:21.376 --> 00:14:21.837]  Two million.
[00:14:25.993 --> 00:14:33.582]  And now they stand around and go, the answer, literally, tear down the dams, tell no one come live here, because there's too many people.
[00:14:34.343 --> 00:14:40.810]  Oh, don't innovate, tear things down, that's Agenda 21, and then charge you more money for it.
[00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.052]  So I'm going to talk about it later in the hour.
[00:14:42.072 --> 00:14:45.055]  I always say something's coming up and I start getting into it now.
[00:14:46.112 --> 00:14:57.442]  It's just amazing how they sit there and deny to people they have an anti-human agenda, shutting off our plants, not letting us build new plants, tearing down dams, not letting us build new dams.
[00:14:57.802 --> 00:15:00.465]  And people say to me, Alex, this isn't really a big election issue.
[00:15:00.505 --> 00:15:01.746]  Why do you harp on it so much?
[00:15:02.146 --> 00:15:03.668]  We need to make it the issue.
[00:15:03.968 --> 00:15:05.109]  That's what I was trying to say Thursday.
[00:15:05.769 --> 00:15:06.610]  We have to
[00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:19.734]  Focus on what is truly important, define it, cover it ourselves, and not always just chase the story that the MSM is putting out, because that's the only power they still have.
[00:15:21.014 --> 00:15:34.517]  They have a skeleton audience compared to what they had, a shadow of a shadow, they are discredited, they have a 6% trust rate in scientific polls, and other information shows that AP poll is very, very accurate, common sense shows it.
[00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:44.687]  But still, when they cover topics, we're forced to respond, and we still kind of act like it's a big deal to be on CNN or something.
[00:15:45.067 --> 00:15:48.493]  Every day people say, I saw you on CNN, I saw you on Fox, I could care less.
[00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:52.682]  They're playing clips of this show on those shows every day.
[00:15:53.123 --> 00:15:58.028]  I don't even sit here and play clips of my own show now, 95% of the time.
[00:15:58.588 --> 00:16:00.030]  Because again, it's not about us.
[00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:09.840]  But when they're sitting there totally and absolutely deceiving people, we have to, because it's illustrative of how they operate and how they get their job done.
[00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:19.246]  Oh, shutting off all these big reservoirs in Northern California and Southern Oregon, it didn't cause anybody to go bankrupt.
[00:16:19.487 --> 00:16:20.588]  There's nothing happening.
[00:16:20.988 --> 00:16:24.592]  Why can you believe that Donald Trump said the moon was made of cheese yesterday?
[00:16:24.612 --> 00:16:26.914]  And where'd he get the disinfo from?
[00:16:29.397 --> 00:16:30.238]  Why the bad guy?
[00:16:31.038 --> 00:16:32.160]  The king of conspiracy.
[00:16:33.677 --> 00:16:52.831]  Who actually has been out to Northern California to talk to these farmers, and my reporters have been there many times just last year, and we've been all over the story, and had scientists on to talk about it, but none of that matters because CNN, MSNBC, Salon, and all those other groups, they came out and laughed at us and said it didn't exist.
[00:16:54.672 --> 00:16:55.933]  It didn't exist.
[00:16:56.734 --> 00:16:58.335]  Just like families never existed.
[00:17:00.503 --> 00:17:05.849]  Because next they're going to say that, not just that father and mother is bad, but that it never really even existed.
[00:17:07.111 --> 00:17:11.676]  They're already coming out and saying, you know, it was always really a village that raised the children, not a family.
[00:17:11.716 --> 00:17:16.041]  See, that's, which is true, but that was your other extended family.
[00:17:16.081 --> 00:17:16.862]  You could trust them.
[00:17:17.964 --> 00:17:20.906]  Then the state came in and said, it's not good to discipline your own children.
[00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:28.510]  Then they said, it's not good to have your neighbors watch them, and your kids can't be in their front yard or their backyard unattended, even when they're 11 or 12 years old, or we'll arrest you.
[00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:33.773]  See, they kill the village, they build artificial systems, and then they tell us the state is the village.
[00:17:35.173 --> 00:17:38.055]  And they take away our farms, and give us big factory farms.
[00:17:38.395 --> 00:17:43.258]  Everything is about total and complete control.
[00:17:44.821 --> 00:17:46.782]  All right, I've already digressed at the very start of the broadcast.
[00:17:46.802 --> 00:17:48.622]  Let me tell you what's coming up after the break.
[00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:51.343]  Look at this.
[00:17:51.503 --> 00:17:53.964]  Donald Trump uses Alex Jones as an actual news source.
[00:17:54.585 --> 00:17:54.945]  Ha ha!
[00:17:55.245 --> 00:17:56.685]  They are so scared of what we cover.
[00:17:56.705 --> 00:18:00.907]  They are so scared of how we read the defense bills, where they say they have re-education camps.
[00:18:00.927 --> 00:18:01.867]  They actually use that term.
[00:18:02.067 --> 00:18:04.208]  They are so freaked out that we know how government works.
[00:18:04.428 --> 00:18:07.309]  They're so freaked out we know about shadow government and COG.
[00:18:07.529 --> 00:18:11.191]  They're so freaked out we understand a larger battle plan and have read their white papers.
[00:18:11.351 --> 00:18:12.311]  They're so freaked out.
[00:18:17.748 --> 00:18:20.790]  Environmentalists caused California drought to protect this fish.
[00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:25.174]  Ah, California, the place where liberalism is wrecking real world havoc on people.
[00:18:25.414 --> 00:18:26.635]  And they make fun of this article.
[00:18:28.896 --> 00:18:29.477]  Think about that.
[00:18:30.137 --> 00:18:33.860]  It's well known that the high taxes are making people leave California.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.482]  It's well known the regulations are making people leave California.
[00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:42.607]  It's well known California is in deep manure, with most of its counties and cities already bankrupt.
[00:18:43.851 --> 00:18:48.654]  Just like so many other cities and counties around the country and so many protectorates of this republic.
[00:18:50.595 --> 00:18:55.939]  Like the one out there straddling the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean that just went belly up a month ago.
[00:18:56.339 --> 00:18:56.900]  Puerto Rico.
[00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:00.662]  It's so incredible.
[00:19:05.452 --> 00:19:10.334]  There's one country out there that's doing well, and that's because it won't take any global funding or money and it's independent.
[00:19:10.834 --> 00:19:15.495]  And it's the eastern half of what was Hispaniola, Dominican Republic today.
[00:19:16.136 --> 00:19:23.218]  But again, I'm digressing into a topic I was going to get into a little bit later in the transmission.
[00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.531]  Obviously, we're going to get into all the latest Donald Trump news.
[00:19:27.711 --> 00:19:35.734]  Obviously, we have our reporters in Germany covering Bilderberg that kicks off in a couple days, but they've already been to migrant camps with explosive results.
[00:19:36.154 --> 00:19:38.614]  Migrant camp freaks out on reporters asking questions.
[00:19:38.675 --> 00:19:40.555]  Rob Dew for InfoWars.com.
[00:19:40.655 --> 00:19:43.536]  Also, medieval Trump wall found in Germany.
[00:19:43.856 --> 00:19:44.837]  Very powerful report.
[00:19:45.157 --> 00:19:46.657]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:19:47.337 --> 00:19:47.978]  Also, another clip.
[00:19:47.998 --> 00:19:51.779]  Hillary Clinton says government has a right to regulate the Second Amendment.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.881]  We're going to be covering all of that.
[00:19:55.301 --> 00:20:02.408]  We also have another article up on Infowars.com written by Paul Joseph Watson that's going viral via DrugsReport.com right now.
[00:20:03.449 --> 00:20:03.949]  Video!
[00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:09.073]  Obese woman starts trashing store after EBT card gets refused.
[00:20:10.635 --> 00:20:19.222]  This message is not just addressed to my fellow Americans, but addressed to people across the world of every race, color, and creed who believe in free speech.
[00:20:20.203 --> 00:20:23.305]  ...enshrined here in our Republic as the First Amendment.
[00:20:24.006 --> 00:20:27.408]  It's the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights because it is the most important.
[00:20:27.428 --> 00:20:36.394]  The right to speak, the right to publish, the right to assemble, the right to petition, the right to practice your own religion and not having a state-run or authorized system.
[00:20:36.554 --> 00:20:45.781]  We have seen Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other media platforms increasingly censor even mainline libertarian and conservative ideas.
[00:20:46.101 --> 00:20:57.647]  Ladies and gentlemen, Facebook, if it's able to successfully get away with censoring a wide spectrum of ideas that the establishment doesn't agree with, not just conservatives, will set a mega-massive precedent.
[00:20:58.168 --> 00:20:59.548]  Facebook's over a third of the internet.
[00:20:59.568 --> 00:21:00.349]  Speaking about that?
[00:21:00.849 --> 00:21:02.350]  Of the traffic and people visiting things.
[00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:03.310]  And then it's over.
[00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:07.913]  You think it's bad that communist China with a billion, 300 million people is censoring?
[00:21:08.753 --> 00:21:16.022]  Zuckerberg, who calls his users dumb F-ers, has been meeting with the Chinese censorship leadership, openly trying to tweak it.
[00:21:16.122 --> 00:21:21.028]  He met with Merkel, and openly in a hot mic, said, don't worry, I'm going to start suppressing and censoring people.
[00:21:21.229 --> 00:21:25.674]  They report when someone criticizes open borders to the German government, and they come and arrest you.
[00:21:25.834 --> 00:21:26.655]  This is a global
[00:21:27.176 --> 00:21:27.616]  We're good.
[00:21:44.531 --> 00:21:45.071]  Most don't want.
[00:21:45.171 --> 00:21:47.292]  This is the ultimate threat to humanity.
[00:21:47.692 --> 00:21:49.853]  This is worse than what we saw in the Soviet Union.
[00:21:50.273 --> 00:21:54.055]  This is right out of Nazi Germany or right out of Maoist China.
[00:21:54.455 --> 00:21:55.796]  So we're fighting for free speech.
[00:21:56.136 --> 00:22:06.200]  When you spread the word about Infowars.com, our videos, our stories, our reports, and when you post it on different platforms, that circumvents their AI systems that are trying to restrict the flow of information.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.261]  We stand together or we hang separate.
[00:22:08.481 --> 00:22:13.323]  Another thing we're doing is not just battling to stop the censorship, we're also building other platforms.
[00:22:13.743 --> 00:22:21.569]  Getting on as many third party systems as there are out there and spreading the word of basic free market liberty and human empowerment and the new renaissance.
[00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.333]  But also, the experts I've talked to said, Alex, you missed the boat.
[00:22:25.373 --> 00:22:28.855]  You've been a pioneer in many ways, but you haven't promoted email.
[00:22:29.076 --> 00:22:31.037]  And I said, yeah, I don't ever really market on email.
[00:22:31.137 --> 00:22:32.959]  I just, I just, it's low tech.
[00:22:33.139 --> 00:22:35.461]  And they're like, no, no, no, that's what's going to be hard to censor.
[00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:42.146]  Even if the internet kill switch comes into place, there are systems and there are developments that make it very hard still
[00:22:43.127 --> 00:22:48.631]  To stop email and to stop that information being sent over networks, you name it.
[00:22:48.691 --> 00:23:02.341]  So, it's essential that everybody go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter to get exclusive articles, videos, promo code sometimes, the shopping cart like we had a few weeks ago with Hillary for prison, 50% off.
[00:23:02.641 --> 00:23:07.465]  I mean there are some big discounts we send to incentivize people and plus you're some of the most hardcore patriots.
[00:23:07.785 --> 00:23:12.127]  You can send the email and the newsletter on with exclusive videos and articles many days.
[00:23:12.767 --> 00:23:13.728]  So that's another great reason.
[00:23:13.748 --> 00:23:20.051]  But overall, it's so that we have direct contact with fellow patriots out there around the world.
[00:23:20.571 --> 00:23:29.295]  And if they try to start shutting our websites down and other things, which they've tried to do, and kick us off Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, you name it, we'll be able to send you direct videos
[00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:31.876]  That you can then send on to others.
[00:23:31.896 --> 00:23:51.804]  We've all got to start thinking about censorship and actively fighting it, getting more active and not taking independent liberty-based media for granted, which I know you don't do, but really having a sense of urgency and getting the info out more while building new avenues on cutting-edge tech and cutting-edge platforms, but also old tech like email.
[00:23:52.064 --> 00:23:53.145]  So please join
[00:23:54.025 --> 00:23:59.471]  Hundreds of thousands of others that have been signing up every few months at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:23:59.811 --> 00:24:08.941]  And you can also spread the word about our free feeds and more podcasts, droid apps, iPhone apps, it's all free at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:24:19.568 --> 00:24:32.839]  Roger Stone did not tell me who the VP choice of Donald Trump is for Vice President.
[00:24:35.261 --> 00:24:39.945]  But he did concur with my prediction.
[00:24:42.438 --> 00:24:43.319]  Of who it will be.
[00:24:43.679 --> 00:24:45.520]  He said no one knows but Trump at this point.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:53.825]  He's not gonna talk about private meetings that he's been in with the shortlist, hearing what Trump thinks, and Trump bouncing it off Stone and others.
[00:24:56.227 --> 00:25:08.034]  And he doesn't want to talk bad about Corey Lewandowski, the embattled head of the campaign, who really is just a glorified trail manager right now.
[00:25:11.983 --> 00:25:17.304]  But when Lewandowski goes on television and says that he's heading up the vetting process, that is not the case.
[00:25:18.005 --> 00:25:26.407]  They brought in former top lawyers for Ronald Reagan who are doing the background checking and research on who Trump likes.
[00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:33.129]  So it's Donald Trump, and I came up with my own list of three people.
[00:25:34.241 --> 00:25:35.802]  And Stone, actually, his eyes got big.
[00:25:35.822 --> 00:25:36.322]  He gulped.
[00:25:36.543 --> 00:25:37.203]  I've got to know him good.
[00:25:37.243 --> 00:25:37.984]  He's such a character.
[00:25:38.264 --> 00:25:39.144]  I just like him as a person.
[00:25:39.985 --> 00:25:41.886]  And he just said, well, you said that on air.
[00:25:41.906 --> 00:25:42.727]  You didn't get that from me.
[00:25:42.747 --> 00:25:47.630]  And he visibly kind of turned a little bit red and was concerned that Trump would think he told me.
[00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:55.636]  So we've got an interview where he actually goes further than he ever has on who he thinks the shortlist is.
[00:25:56.036 --> 00:25:57.137]  That's going to air at 1.33 today.
[00:25:57.157 --> 00:25:57.937]  It's a 20 minute interview.
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.402]  And then that ends the hour or so, and then David Knight comes in.
[00:26:05.343 --> 00:26:06.363]  But that's coming up today.
[00:26:06.403 --> 00:26:09.806]  We have our reporters from the migrant camps there in Germany.
[00:26:09.826 --> 00:26:10.666]  They're just everywhere.
[00:26:11.487 --> 00:26:14.789]  And that the government's trying to keep the press from documenting.
[00:26:16.906 --> 00:26:18.306]  Good luck stopping drones.
[00:26:34.991 --> 00:26:41.203]  We've got Rob Duh and Josh Owens in Deutschland, what's left of it, for the next 10 days.
[00:26:41.323 --> 00:26:47.414]  Bilderberg kicks off on Thursday, they'll run right through Sunday, and then more migrant camps come back next week.
[00:26:48.413 --> 00:26:50.094]  I appreciate Rob Dues' wife.
[00:26:50.894 --> 00:26:54.276]  He's our news director making the sacrifice to let Rob be out on the road so much.
[00:26:54.336 --> 00:27:06.121]  He wants to do it, and I'm really good friends with Rob and his four children, and my children, but we vacation together some and hang out a lot, so he's a good friend, a great guy, and so is Josh Owens.
[00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:07.381]  It's just wonderful, all these people.
[00:27:07.421 --> 00:27:08.261]  I've gotten to know so well.
[00:27:08.281 --> 00:27:08.862]  They're my family.
[00:27:09.782 --> 00:27:12.505]  At the end of the day, but they're over there, so pray for them.
[00:27:12.826 --> 00:27:14.988]  By the way, I'm gonna come back and hit the news here in a moment.
[00:27:15.008 --> 00:27:15.769]  This is a short segment.
[00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:21.996]  It's not a story about Roger Stone so much as it's about life, because I'm gonna come back and briefly talk about Muhammad Ali.
[00:27:23.097 --> 00:27:25.960]  I was here on Saturday to tape three different segments.
[00:27:26.923 --> 00:27:31.586]  That we're going to air Saturday, Sunday, and then today on Big Topics with Roger Stone.
[00:27:31.966 --> 00:27:42.792]  The real reason he came to town was to discuss a lot of inside baseball things, coming up with Cleveland, and to fill me in on a lot of things off the record so that I could navigate into the future.
[00:27:43.212 --> 00:27:50.396]  And he's filled me in on some things off record about a year ago that all came true, and then again about six months ago, and then a few months ago when he came back to Austin, Texas.
[00:27:50.416 --> 00:27:54.598]  So this is pretty important stuff, obviously, that I got briefed on, but I can't talk about it until the future.
[00:27:59.414 --> 00:28:12.542]  We were talking for about an hour back there in the conference room, just he and I, and he got a call from his wife, and his 93-year-old mother had come home from the hospital, and they had just said, look, she's gonna die any day now, but she's still all there.
[00:28:12.962 --> 00:28:14.883]  She's in excruciating pain with lung cancer.
[00:28:15.344 --> 00:28:17.245]  We're going to give her morphine.
[00:28:18.265 --> 00:28:18.806]  She wants it.
[00:28:20.387 --> 00:28:22.668]  And he said, can I see you in a minute or two?
[00:28:22.748 --> 00:28:26.871]  And then he went around and looked out in the foyer area, and I walked by, and I saw tears in his eyes.
[00:28:27.942 --> 00:28:29.362]  And he got off the phone.
[00:28:29.382 --> 00:28:32.383]  He goes, that was the last time I'll probably ever talk to my mother while she's all there.
[00:28:32.423 --> 00:28:33.624]  This is Saturday at about noon.
[00:28:34.384 --> 00:28:37.245]  She's about to go on morphine in a super high dose.
[00:28:37.265 --> 00:28:38.745]  She'll probably die in the next 48 hours.
[00:28:39.045 --> 00:28:40.866]  I've got to go finish a Trump speech on Sunday.
[00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:42.686]  I'm going to leave here early now.
[00:28:42.706 --> 00:28:45.807]  I was going to fly out Sunday morning, but because of all the storms, I'm going to leave this afternoon.
[00:28:46.447 --> 00:28:48.248]  And he pulled himself up.
[00:28:48.408 --> 00:28:49.548]  I mean, he wasn't even really crying.
[00:28:49.908 --> 00:28:50.749]  He pulled himself up.
[00:28:50.969 --> 00:28:55.250]  We came in here, shot the segments, and went out to lunch, talked about his mother.
[00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.112]  And what a great lady she was.
[00:28:57.132 --> 00:28:58.413]  And I always love hearing about people's mothers.
[00:28:59.114 --> 00:28:59.835]  And then left.
[00:28:59.855 --> 00:29:05.483]  By the way, I want Steve Pichenik to come on soon to do a whole hour on his mother and this book he's written about her.
[00:29:05.823 --> 00:29:06.604]  What an amazing lady.
[00:29:08.274 --> 00:29:12.135]  Pachinik actually did make it out of the Holocaust and his family, most of them, were actually killed.
[00:29:12.815 --> 00:29:19.056]  That's why he actually can't stand the ADL or those other groups is because he documents what they really did.
[00:29:19.076 --> 00:29:25.458]  The groups before the ADL not letting Jews get out of Germany unless they paid big bounties to Jewish mafia organizations.
[00:29:25.898 --> 00:29:30.759]  That's why Pachinik comes on air and exposes some of the more criminal elements of things going on in Israel.
[00:29:31.259 --> 00:29:33.039]  That's why it's so credible too when he does it.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:34.820]  But he's written a book about that.
[00:29:35.868 --> 00:29:37.169]  They wouldn't let him get into the U.S., though.
[00:29:37.189 --> 00:29:38.209]  They had to get into Cuba first.
[00:29:39.329 --> 00:29:40.770]  And then they got into the U.S.
[00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.131]  via Canada, into Cuba.
[00:29:43.331 --> 00:29:50.554]  Into the U.S., but then Roger Stone called me at about, or texted me at about 3.15 last night saying, yeah, my mom just died.
[00:29:50.914 --> 00:29:52.315]  You know, thanks, pal, for all your support.
[00:29:52.335 --> 00:29:54.196]  I happened to be up at that time, too.
[00:29:54.216 --> 00:29:56.097]  Strangely, I'd woken up.
[00:29:56.537 --> 00:29:57.777]  That's a classy guy right there.
[00:29:58.178 --> 00:29:58.838]  We'll be back.
[00:29:59.625 --> 00:30:02.607]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.548 --> 00:30:06.230]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:11.624 --> 00:30:17.967]  I got so busy fighting the Globals for 15 years, I turned into a giant fat slob when I was an exercise fanatic before.
[00:30:18.367 --> 00:30:21.449]  Now in the last five years, I set out to try to get back in shape.
[00:30:21.889 --> 00:30:33.735]  And to help turbocharge that, I talked to top scientists and nutraceutical developers and said, I want something that blocks these estrogen mimickers, something that helps me get back to what a real male was like instead of this Globals bombardment.
[00:30:34.215 --> 00:30:37.096]  And we developed Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[00:30:37.256 --> 00:30:38.116]  They're best sellers.
[00:30:38.337 --> 00:30:39.677]  They're loved across the industry.
[00:30:39.837 --> 00:30:40.437]  They're amazing.

[00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:13.458]  A new tell-all book is shocking the Hillary campaign.
[00:31:13.618 --> 00:31:19.784]  Crisis of Character, a White House Secret Service officer discloses his first-hand experience with Hillary, Bill, and how they operate.
[00:31:19.804 --> 00:31:24.869]  It was written by former Secret Service agent Gary Byrne, who was posted outside the Oval Office during the Clinton years.
[00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:28.873]  The book reveals the real personality of Hillary, not the fake one you see on TV.
[00:31:29.013 --> 00:31:32.737]  And it's already at number one at Amazon, despite not being released until June 28th.
[00:31:32.917 --> 00:31:33.898]  But what's in the book?
[00:31:34.158 --> 00:31:39.363]  Well, it portrays Hillary as, quote, too erratic, uncontrollable, and occasionally violent to become president.
[00:31:39.524 --> 00:31:43.187]  Byrne describes Hillary as acting friendly one moment, then raging the next.
[00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:48.613]  In fact, Secret Service agents discussed the possibility they would have to protect Bill from his wife's physical attacks.
[00:31:48.993 --> 00:31:52.998]  And the couple had one violent encounter the morning of a key presidential address to the nation.
[00:31:53.258 --> 00:32:01.868]  Byrne wrote, quote, Hillary Clinton is now poised to become the Democratic nominee for the President of the United States, but she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office.
[00:32:02.188 --> 00:32:04.451]  From the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true.
[00:32:04.731 --> 00:32:07.534]  And you can find out more at InfoWars.com.
[00:32:07.614 --> 00:32:08.796]  This is Keith Daniels reporting.
[00:32:10.535 --> 00:32:11.916]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:32:12.176 --> 00:32:13.477]  You can't survive without it.
[00:32:13.677 --> 00:32:14.577]  But where do you get it?

[00:32:20.861 --> 00:32:26.584]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[00:32:46.503 --> 00:32:47.704]  Stainless steel construction.

[00:32:49.024 --> 00:32:49.644]  Low maintenance.
[00:32:49.945 --> 00:32:51.765]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:27.803]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.104 --> 00:33:42.968]  Alright, in a moment, before I plunge into the political news, the geopolitical news, the military news,
[00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:58.375]  War on the family news as we chronicle the globalist operations in their attempt to fully take over all life on earth and set themselves up as technocratic demigods.
[00:34:00.035 --> 00:34:09.939]  But before we do that I want to talk about Muhammad Ali because I was just discussing Roger Stone who was here talking to his mom on Saturday
[00:34:11.567 --> 00:34:12.968]  For what he said will probably be the last time.
[00:34:12.988 --> 00:34:16.530]  He said, I gotta go out here and call my mom, probably talk to her for the last time before they put her on morphine.
[00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:23.333]  I hope she holds on to like, you know, get back on Monday, but I gotta give a Trump speech, a Trump rally on Sunday.
[00:34:23.353 --> 00:34:24.294]  She's totally committed.
[00:34:24.314 --> 00:34:26.555]  That guy works like 18 hours a day during a campaign.
[00:34:26.595 --> 00:34:27.215]  He's a machine.
[00:34:28.436 --> 00:34:31.858]  And, you know, then learning that she died last night about 3.15.
[00:34:32.518 --> 00:34:33.759]  People say, well, she's 93 years old.
[00:34:33.819 --> 00:34:34.039]  Sure.
[00:34:34.319 --> 00:34:36.860]  You're just celebrating the interesting life of someone.
[00:34:37.681 --> 00:34:39.422]  And then you're also reflecting on how
[00:34:40.796 --> 00:34:48.422]  Her son responded to it and continued, you know, moving forward in his overall mission.
[00:34:49.803 --> 00:34:57.349]  And that's really the essence of perseverance and that's the human trait in men and women that I tend to admire the most.
[00:34:58.409 --> 00:35:00.631]  And I think that goes hand in glove with being an honorable person.
[00:35:01.272 --> 00:35:03.653]  But Muhammad Ali raises his fist.
[00:35:04.653 --> 00:35:28.921]  For the last time in his final ever photos, and we'll show some of these really, really amazing, amazing photos of Muhammad Ali, who obviously fought way longer than he should have, that's perseverance, and had massive brainstem damage that led to the neurological disorder that finally took his life.
[00:35:32.188 --> 00:35:36.383]  And it's when we admire people like Muhammad Ali, even though I think we obsess too much on sports.
[00:35:38.772 --> 00:35:45.956]  It's a healthy thing overall because it's about celebrating humanity and everybody that's come before us, currently who we are, and what's going to happen in the future.
[00:35:46.417 --> 00:35:58.164]  And that's why I hate the globalists so much because they're all about telling us how bad we are, how evil we are, how stupid we are, and how we can only attain success by modeling ourselves and conforming to their systems.
[00:35:58.584 --> 00:36:03.107]  And their systems are admittedly designed to make us weak, to make us stupid.
[00:36:04.068 --> 00:36:06.889]  And so some will say, well, do you support what Muhammad Ali did?
[00:36:06.909 --> 00:36:07.470]  And I said, yes.
[00:36:08.709 --> 00:36:23.353]  Even though this sport ended up taking his life, it is only through testing the body and going through great trials and tribulations that the overall species stays strong.
[00:36:24.133 --> 00:36:34.016]  And men, more than anyone, are designed and meant to go out there and break our backs, working, fighting, whatever the case may be.
[00:36:34.496 --> 00:36:37.677]  We are that section of the species.
[00:36:38.786 --> 00:36:46.613]  That doesn't mean that women can't do that as well, and that when women stand up and fight, it's amazing.
[00:36:47.594 --> 00:36:50.876]  But they really are the caregivers, the protectors, the nurturers.
[00:36:51.297 --> 00:37:00.465]  Doesn't mean that men don't have that aspect as well, but they want to basically outlaw rodeo riding, they want to outlaw the NFL, then they're going to outlaw
[00:37:02.037 --> 00:37:07.822]  Even Bush League football, because potentially you could get a concussion, potentially you could get hurt.
[00:37:08.102 --> 00:37:10.665]  Well, potentially you could get hurt driving in a car.
[00:37:11.205 --> 00:37:13.527]  So they want to restrict that and have driverless cars.
[00:37:13.567 --> 00:37:14.428]  You see where this goes.
[00:37:14.728 --> 00:37:20.133]  Removing humans from the environment is like removing gravity from the environment.
[00:37:20.413 --> 00:37:25.337]  It will turn the entire species into boneless jellyfish.
[00:37:26.738 --> 00:37:28.520]  Literally and figuratively.
[00:37:31.161 --> 00:37:33.742]  That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:37:34.362 --> 00:37:46.088]  And in the end, it may not have made Muhammad Ali physically stronger, but it made his spirit and his image and his icon stronger than almost any of us.
[00:37:47.928 --> 00:37:55.892]  And the wealth and the success he brought to his family and his community made the whole species stronger.
[00:37:57.833 --> 00:38:00.174]  And so, Muhammad Ali, you could say, is a real man.
[00:38:00.194 --> 00:38:04.097]  I mean, you watch some of those clips where he dodges 28 punches in 10 seconds?
[00:38:06.478 --> 00:38:07.018]  I see that.
[00:38:07.138 --> 00:38:08.419]  I admire that aspect.
[00:38:08.479 --> 00:38:10.800]  Just like I can admire Ludwig von Beethoven.
[00:38:11.241 --> 00:38:13.082]  Or I could admire Werner Von Braun.
[00:38:13.682 --> 00:38:17.084]  Even though he was a Nazi, I don't admire his politics.
[00:38:17.644 --> 00:38:24.128]  I admire his brain, his vision, that is the space shuttle program, the International Space Station program.
[00:38:26.713 --> 00:38:30.534]  Everything we basically have currently in the main NASA mission.
[00:38:33.175 --> 00:38:36.656]  It'd be like if some painter was a horrible person but was able to paint.
[00:38:36.776 --> 00:38:40.358]  I could admire that aspect of their mind but not the whole person.
[00:38:43.479 --> 00:38:53.122]  And part of this whole politically correct movement is it lets the system say who someone was in some limited stereotype, some limited cliche, and we're all guilty of it,
[00:38:57.116 --> 00:39:07.661]  And then we're supposed to ignore the body of work of everything someone did before or after that moment because of one thing they said joking around on the radio or TV.
[00:39:08.081 --> 00:39:17.725]  Again, it shuts down debate, it chills discussion, it chills real intellectual pursuits, and creates a nightmare civilization that will not be a civilization for very long.
[00:39:19.586 --> 00:39:24.248]  So, chilling photos of Muhammad Ali
[00:39:26.374 --> 00:39:27.615]  Formerly Cassius Clay.
[00:39:29.095 --> 00:39:32.457]  Those photos are linked up on Infowars.com from the UK Sun.
[00:39:36.238 --> 00:39:37.259]  Now here's what's really important.
[00:39:37.299 --> 00:39:38.499]  Let's talk about our real future.
[00:39:38.939 --> 00:39:42.561]  UN adopts education plan to indoctrinate children in globalism.
[00:39:43.061 --> 00:39:46.462]  Alex Newman has an article for the New American Magazine up on Infowars.com.
[00:39:46.723 --> 00:39:50.644]  I want to get him on the broadcast sometime this week or next week to talk about this plan for at least 30 minutes.
[00:39:51.004 --> 00:39:52.365]  The UN is demanding
[00:39:54.915 --> 00:40:01.357]  A demanding planetary education regime to transform children around the world into social justice warriors.
[00:40:03.098 --> 00:40:12.942]  And the United Nations is also setting up a system called Strong Cities Initiative worldwide in every major city.
[00:40:13.602 --> 00:40:18.824]  Getting government taxpayer money through block grants, just like Akron.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:34.526]  To run around and stir up racial and cultural divisions, which are then managed by the UN and the local Democratic Party, who then politically bully government into installing their people in the police departments mainly.
[00:40:35.126 --> 00:40:41.549]  Then the political persecution starts, just like we just witnessed out in California.
[00:40:44.659 --> 00:40:49.580]  In San Jose alone, the mayor comes out and says, oh yeah, these people deserve what's happening to them.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.441]  They're getting beaten up.
[00:40:50.501 --> 00:40:54.602]  And the police came out and said, in tweets Sunday, no, it's true!
[00:40:57.683 --> 00:40:58.183]  It's true!
[00:40:59.943 --> 00:41:08.786]  Yes, we stood down and let hundreds of people get beaten up by the anti-Trump demonstrators because we, quote, didn't want to escalate things.
[00:41:09.847 --> 00:41:26.373]  When you don't arrest people that are beating up women, men beating up a woman, and beating her bloody in front of everyone, and in front of police and reporters, that sends a message to criminals and thugs that you can go out and do it anytime you want.
[00:41:28.191 --> 00:41:35.252]  And I see the images of fire hoses and police dogs attacking women and men in Alabama and that makes me sick.
[00:41:35.853 --> 00:41:39.973]  Because those are humans organized with force attacking peaceful people.
[00:41:40.554 --> 00:41:41.454]  And I have empathy for them.
[00:41:41.934 --> 00:41:50.736]  But when I have empathy for white people or a white woman being beaten up by a mob of racist Hispanics waving Mexican flags, I'm a bad person.
[00:41:51.456 --> 00:41:54.616]  And the New York Times comes out and says the Trump people deserve it.
[00:41:54.696 --> 00:41:55.617]  I have the articles right here.
[00:41:55.657 --> 00:41:57.237]  I covered them yesterday on the Sunday Show.
[00:41:59.349 --> 00:42:01.990]  And they defend it and they say it's a good thing.
[00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:04.850]  Truly sickening.
[00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.271]  So you see where your free speech is going there, don't you?
[00:42:08.671 --> 00:42:12.212]  You see where the social justice warrior model is going.
[00:42:12.232 --> 00:42:14.332]  Remember San Francisco?
[00:42:14.352 --> 00:42:21.454]  A few months ago, there at the college, at the State College, a young white freshman
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:45.614]  Has dreadlocks, has adopted all the fake culture superimposed by Hollywood, even talks with a made-up social justice warrior inner-city dialect, and gets beat up by two trendies who look like they're part African.
[00:42:48.624 --> 00:42:49.985]  And the video just says it all.
[00:42:50.045 --> 00:42:53.587]  It's just an excuse to be nasty, evil, mean thugs.
[00:42:53.647 --> 00:43:03.714]  And I have seen, with my own eyeballs, the KKK act like this to me, not once, but twice.
[00:43:04.074 --> 00:43:05.495]  But there was a different response then.
[00:43:06.716 --> 00:43:08.097]  No fight happened, because I said, let's go!
[00:43:08.717 --> 00:43:10.018]  Your brains are about to be all over the ground.
[00:43:11.052 --> 00:43:11.733]  That's actually what I said.
[00:43:11.753 --> 00:43:14.035]  I'm not proud, but that's how I was when I was 16, 17 years old.
[00:43:14.475 --> 00:43:19.059]  Especially if four or five people, you know, jump out of pick-up trucks and go, we're gonna beat your butt, Yankee!
[00:43:19.099 --> 00:43:19.940]  I'm like, well, get ready.
[00:43:21.521 --> 00:43:37.535]  But this is an effeminate man, being a total trendy with total hate, and then this hateful, guarantee I bet money she's got Mao Zedong books at home, probably hadn't read them though, literally bullying and getting in the face of this white person that's trying to be black.
[00:43:38.544 --> 00:43:41.925]  But you notice the groveling didn't get you any assimilation.
[00:43:44.446 --> 00:43:47.467]  And they don't support the free speech rights of the person with the camera.
[00:43:48.848 --> 00:43:49.768]  Let's put the article back up.
[00:43:49.828 --> 00:43:53.470]  I'll give radio listeners the name of the article from Infowars.com if you want to see it.
[00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:55.410]  This is how these people operate.
[00:43:57.131 --> 00:44:07.755]  And the exact same smirk of people that think they found a wimp, of people that think they found somebody they can push around, of people that think they're tough guys.
[00:44:13.063 --> 00:44:17.886]  Because granted, you know, when I was 16 years old, I probably weighed 170 pounds.
[00:44:19.207 --> 00:44:22.490]  I didn't look like the toughest guy around.
[00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:24.951]  Still, three or four guys, not too smart.
[00:44:24.971 --> 00:44:25.892]  I mean, I didn't look like a wimp.
[00:44:29.054 --> 00:44:32.517]  But if they wanted a fight, they would have gotten one, just like the many fights people did get.
[00:44:33.377 --> 00:44:34.218]  And I'm nobody special.
[00:44:34.258 --> 00:44:34.758]  I'm just a man.
[00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:38.301]  You come looking for a fight, you put your hands on me, you're going to get a problem.
[00:44:40.359 --> 00:44:41.640]  Out at that abortion rally.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:51.466]  If they wouldn't have pulled that guy off, you can see in the video, I was cranked back and in a split second was going to uppercut because the guy had already tried to hit me once and push me another time.
[00:44:52.707 --> 00:45:00.852]  And another time, I saw him pushing some guy on crutches out on the road and I went over there and I couldn't, but by then they ran off.
[00:45:02.073 --> 00:45:07.417]  They also ran away from Jokari when I could tell Jokari had had enough because these people are cowards, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:11.901]  I don't care if it's a bunch of devil-worshipping communists that love abortion clinics.
[00:45:14.323 --> 00:45:16.244]  I don't care whether it's white supremacists.
[00:45:16.825 --> 00:45:24.031]  I don't care whether it's a bunch of trendy so-called black kids.
[00:45:24.171 --> 00:45:31.517]  I mean, those two black people, if you call them that, that's what they call themselves, getting in the face of that white kid
[00:45:33.339 --> 00:45:34.200]  That white nerd.
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.141]  I mean, they don't look black to me.
[00:45:36.161 --> 00:45:38.863]  I mean, maybe 20% African.
[00:45:39.223 --> 00:45:40.544]  It's like saying, I don't look Native American.
[00:45:41.545 --> 00:45:43.306]  Even though I'm like 13% or something.
[00:45:43.826 --> 00:45:46.588]  I mean, this is the type of stuff that we're dealing with.
[00:45:46.989 --> 00:45:49.290]  Like saying, you know, you're not Native American.
[00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:49.931]  I'm going to beat you up.
[00:45:49.951 --> 00:45:51.131]  And like, well, you don't look like that either.
[00:45:51.512 --> 00:45:53.073]  It's like, what are you appropriating?
[00:45:53.493 --> 00:45:58.517]  It's who's the, who's all the, who's that famous lady that thinks she's black and lied about it.
[00:45:58.537 --> 00:46:01.679]  And then turned out, you know, that, that, uh, that, that she has no African heritage.
[00:46:03.097 --> 00:46:03.857]  What's that woman's name?
[00:46:06.638 --> 00:46:07.918]  Yeah, Rachel Dozal.
[00:46:07.958 --> 00:46:09.339]  They put makeup on all this stuff.
[00:46:09.619 --> 00:46:10.719]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[00:46:10.759 --> 00:46:12.240]  Just be who you are.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:20.082]  I get why they're saying they're mad at the white kid trying to appropriate their culture, but that's what freedom's all about, I thought, right?
[00:46:24.823 --> 00:46:27.564]  But this is the disaster zone that we've become.
[00:46:31.265 --> 00:46:31.805]  This is the
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:38.323]  System where all of our real freedoms are scrapped, but we're given all these faux rights.
[00:46:39.724 --> 00:46:40.565]  But look at these headlines.
[00:46:41.586 --> 00:46:46.870]  Reuters, Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by 11 points.
[00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:48.111]  And everybody's freaking out about this.
[00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:49.813]  Folks, that is a totally fake poll.
[00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:56.358]  There are scores of scientific polls out where he's three to four points ahead, or a dead heat, or two points behind.
[00:46:57.273 --> 00:47:01.697]  And a lot of people are intimidated and wouldn't say in a poll whether they're going to vote for Trump or not.
[00:47:01.937 --> 00:47:04.459]  This is the demographics that they are targeting for these polls.
[00:47:04.739 --> 00:47:07.622]  So don't let it create the perception that he's a loser.
[00:47:08.562 --> 00:47:13.907]  So then people turn against Trump because they want to be betting on the winning sports team.
[00:47:15.987 --> 00:47:20.250]  It's a well-known phenomenon that when a team is in the playoffs, you know, they double, triple, quadruple the sales.
[00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:28.454]  And if they win the playoffs and win the Super Bowl or win the World Cup or win the World Series, boom.
[00:47:29.375 --> 00:47:30.836]  They sell 10, 20, 30 times.
[00:47:30.876 --> 00:47:32.597]  You never know for a period of time.
[00:47:32.617 --> 00:47:34.258]  Everybody wants to be associated with winners.
[00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:44.877]  And that's how they create these fake political ideas and tell you, you're going to be a winner if you adopt this lifestyle, if you adopt this culture, if you adopt this system, if you go out and get two degrees.
[00:47:45.537 --> 00:47:48.900]  It doesn't matter if 90% of time those degrees are worthless.
[00:47:50.721 --> 00:47:54.083]  It doesn't matter if you adopt a political view, it's meant to disenfranchise you.
[00:47:54.564 --> 00:47:58.406]  You still feel like a winner but wonder why it didn't make you successful.
[00:47:58.687 --> 00:48:03.210]  It must be because you didn't accept whatever you were being sold even more.
[00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:13.903]  Obama compares San Jose violence to bad habits of Republican Party and says it's the Republicans' fault.
[00:48:15.724 --> 00:48:16.345]  Isn't that nice?
[00:48:16.805 --> 00:48:17.546]  Well, here's one.
[00:48:18.046 --> 00:48:19.087]  San Jose Police.
[00:48:19.147 --> 00:48:25.011]  We held back from protecting Trump supporters from attack so as not to incite further violence.
[00:48:25.572 --> 00:48:27.033]  We started saying this back on Friday.
[00:48:27.073 --> 00:48:27.793]  We have the video.
[00:48:27.833 --> 00:48:28.914]  Our listeners sent us video to me.
[00:48:28.954 --> 00:48:30.015]  We said, oh, you're making that up.
[00:48:30.215 --> 00:48:30.976]  They didn't stand down.
[00:48:31.156 --> 00:48:33.638]  Really, there's video of folks getting beat up right in front of the police 10 feet away.
[00:48:33.898 --> 00:48:36.000]  And here the police tweet out that, yes, they did that.
[00:48:39.252 --> 00:48:41.720]  What they're saying is, we're going to allow this to go on.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.327]  We're going to allow people to be sucker punched and women to be attacked.
[00:48:47.438 --> 00:48:52.062]  Homeland Security using private contractor vans to transport and release illegal aliens inside the U.S.
[00:48:52.322 --> 00:48:53.003]  Judicial Watch.
[00:48:53.403 --> 00:49:06.714]  Yes, Judicial Watch is confirmed two years after Adnan Salazar, Kit Daniels and Jakari Jackson went down to the border and had the head of emergency management in McAllen, Texas say it on tape in front of the buses being loaded up with the illegals.
[00:49:06.934 --> 00:49:09.677]  And then a month later, the Border Patrol came out and said, that report is true.
[00:49:09.977 --> 00:49:12.859]  We are ordered to complete the smuggling process.
[00:49:13.973 --> 00:49:16.575]  So I'm glad Judicial Watch got some documents to confirm that.
[00:49:16.615 --> 00:49:18.075]  We already know it with our own eyeballs.
[00:49:18.456 --> 00:49:21.137]  We don't need the police, too, to tell us, yeah, we stood down.
[00:49:21.978 --> 00:49:30.963]  We know you stood down, and you stood down because your bosses in the police department are anti-American totalitarians, and they want to shut free speech down in this country.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:36.803]  Homeland Security using private contractor vans to transport and release illegal aliens inside the U.S.
[00:49:36.923 --> 00:49:37.223]  Boom!
[00:49:37.923 --> 00:49:42.426]  Video shows same Mexican thug sucker punch two different victims in San Jose.
[00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:45.568]  People then say it is racist to say he's Mexican.
[00:49:45.788 --> 00:49:47.489]  It's like saying a white thug or a black thug.
[00:49:47.749 --> 00:49:49.070]  If it's racial, you point that out.
[00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:53.553]  It's like people say, hey, the Infowars, the Daily Caller and, uh,
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:00.204]  Donald Trump, or talk about this Mexican judge that keeps ruling against him, and keeps ruling for illegals.
[00:50:00.605 --> 00:50:03.267]  The guy is for Mexican nationalism.
[00:50:03.487 --> 00:50:04.789]  He's high-level La Raza.
[00:50:05.009 --> 00:50:06.070]  That's what it means.
[00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:07.031]  That's what it is.
[00:50:07.331 --> 00:50:11.195]  You're calling Trump a Nazi with no Nazi affiliations or connections.
[00:50:11.455 --> 00:50:14.798]  You've got a La Raza judge.
[00:50:15.619 --> 00:50:18.682]  And the media says, well, it's okay for us to racially organize Hispanics.
[00:50:19.222 --> 00:50:19.763]  No, it's not.
[00:50:22.381 --> 00:50:25.482]  If we're going to be this plural society, then you have to go with that.
[00:50:25.742 --> 00:50:37.665]  You can't sit there and organize around racial policies and racial groups claiming you're a minority when you're a supermajority on two continents and going to be 60% of the population in like 10 years.
[00:50:38.045 --> 00:50:38.985]  Most areas are to that.
[00:50:39.166 --> 00:50:40.066]  That's fine with me!
[00:50:40.926 --> 00:50:44.447]  We need to have folks adopt liberty, private property, and things like that.
[00:50:44.687 --> 00:50:47.888]  Which, culturally, these groups are ready to do.
[00:50:49.502 --> 00:51:09.385]  That's why the globalist anthropologists and sociologists are in there at the school level creating chip-on-the-shoulder race-based nationalism at every perceived slight and real slight to forge people into a group you contain in race-based barrios run by local mob boss chiefs who want to keep people under their control.
[00:51:10.387 --> 00:51:11.389]  Brain Force is here.
[00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:14.214]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:51:14.475 --> 00:51:22.309]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:51:23.072 --> 00:51:26.214]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:51:26.515 --> 00:51:26.655]  Right?
[00:51:26.675 --> 00:51:29.017]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:51:29.377 --> 00:51:32.900]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:36.082]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:51:36.582 --> 00:51:41.366]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:51:41.927 --> 00:51:43.748]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[00:51:44.108 --> 00:51:48.532]  That is activated by the different compounds in the yerba mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:51:48.692 --> 00:51:50.693]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:51:51.314 --> 00:51:52.775]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:51:52.935 --> 00:51:53.175]  Exactly.
[00:51:53.195 --> 00:51:56.997]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:51:57.497 --> 00:52:05.500]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.962]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:52:12.022 --> 00:52:13.883]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:52:14.044 --> 00:52:16.906]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:52:16.946 --> 00:52:22.811]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:52:23.011 --> 00:52:30.378]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[00:52:30.518 --> 00:52:31.898]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:52:32.198 --> 00:52:37.080]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.360]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:52:39.701 --> 00:52:43.162]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:52:43.322 --> 00:52:49.863]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:52:49.943 --> 00:52:51.864]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:52:51.964 --> 00:52:52.384]  It's normally $220 plus.
[00:52:55.745 --> 00:53:00.611]  But right now, for a limited time, it's less than $200 at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:53:00.712 --> 00:53:03.275]  And the small profit we make goes to fund our reporters.
[00:53:03.395 --> 00:53:04.697]  This is a 360 win.
[00:53:04.897 --> 00:53:09.043]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:53:10.129 --> 00:53:19.159]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:27.349]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:53:27.629 --> 00:53:32.310]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:39.212]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:53:39.292 --> 00:53:46.374]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:53:46.474 --> 00:53:53.316]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:57.839]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:53:57.979 --> 00:54:01.221]  Available in original, or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:54:01.361 --> 00:54:07.505]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:54:07.666 --> 00:54:09.347]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:54:09.447 --> 00:54:10.708]  We've got it.
[00:54:10.728 --> 00:54:19.513]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:54:19.694 --> 00:54:21.135]  Oh, thank you, uncle.
[00:54:32.601 --> 00:54:33.142]  Look at this!
[00:54:33.702 --> 00:54:35.783]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:54:37.023 --> 00:54:38.424]  Communist Angela Davis.
[00:54:39.084 --> 00:54:42.005]  We have to do whatever is necessary to stop Donald Trump.
[00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:44.626]  1960s radical supports Black Lives Matter.
[00:54:44.646 --> 00:54:48.588]  This is at a meeting with Gloria Steinem of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:54:49.368 --> 00:54:50.429]  That's declassified.
[00:54:51.049 --> 00:54:52.290]  People think I'm joking when I say that.
[00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:52.630]  Look it up.
[00:54:53.868 --> 00:54:55.931]  And they go on to say, here are the tweets.
[00:54:57.893 --> 00:55:04.743]  All you Warchester gangsters and whatnot, you clearly have a mission on Wednesday, kill Donald Trump.
[00:55:04.763 --> 00:55:06.545]  That's what one of her supporters at the meeting said.
[00:55:07.667 --> 00:55:09.990]  And people just tweet this by the thousands and nothing's done.
[00:55:12.588 --> 00:55:20.853]  And then all these ignorant people show up at Trump rallies believing they're confronting racism because the media has branded the Tea Party movement as racist.
[00:55:21.193 --> 00:55:24.314]  So anyone promoting free market is now racist forever.
[00:55:24.735 --> 00:55:29.337]  You are walled off now to be controlled by communist and globalist programming at the university level.
[00:55:30.178 --> 00:55:31.618]  They're telling you your role.
[00:55:31.879 --> 00:55:33.399]  They're telling you who you are.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.781]  You're a woman, so you support Gloria Steinem.
[00:55:37.742 --> 00:55:39.823]  You're black, so you hate Donald Trump.
[00:55:42.056 --> 00:55:43.656]  You're Hispanic, so you hate Trump.
[00:55:44.537 --> 00:55:51.739]  Because Trump pointed out that Mexico is completely nationalist, controls its own borders, and says it wants to quote, reconquer the Southwest and is dumping its criminals on us.
[00:55:52.399 --> 00:55:57.120]  Now does that mean you don't have a bunch of people going to Trump rallies, maybe 10% that are racist?
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.141]  Absolutely, probably.
[00:55:58.481 --> 00:55:58.901]  So what?
[00:55:59.661 --> 00:56:04.663]  Anybody who's black, Hispanic, whatever, you know there's tons of people in your quote group that are racist.
[00:56:05.363 --> 00:56:09.024]  And generally the more uneducated and dumb they are, the more they're into that.
[00:56:11.803 --> 00:56:12.423]  And I want to be clear.
[00:56:15.825 --> 00:56:17.806]  Anglos are not having children anywhere in the world.
[00:56:17.826 --> 00:56:18.747]  Neither are the Japanese.
[00:56:19.467 --> 00:56:21.408]  Any advanced civilization stops having kids.
[00:56:21.468 --> 00:56:22.189]  Is it a project?
[00:56:22.469 --> 00:56:23.049]  Is it a program?
[00:56:23.209 --> 00:56:23.569]  Who knows?
[00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:25.150]  It's a little of both.
[00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:27.391]  People get lazy, they don't want to take care of kids.
[00:56:29.632 --> 00:56:32.174]  And the whole world's being set up to where it's hard to take care of kids.
[00:56:33.305 --> 00:56:36.626]  But then you come in and inherit a civilization, freedom.
[00:56:37.507 --> 00:56:39.128]  It isn't perfect, but better than what you've had.
[00:56:39.648 --> 00:56:43.109]  Do you want to inherit that or do you want to go by what the universities tell you?
[00:56:43.409 --> 00:56:44.990]  That you want to inherit Mao Zedong?
[00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:48.772]  And Obama comes and tells you in Argentina, you know, you need communism.
[00:56:49.192 --> 00:56:50.433]  Yeah, like you need a bullet in the head.
[00:56:51.993 --> 00:56:53.274]  How's Venezuela working out?
[00:56:54.234 --> 00:57:02.618]  They're just sitting there selling you a slave system as if it's trendy and cool and using race-based systems to control you and to flavor the bait.
[00:57:03.953 --> 00:57:04.274]  That's it!
[00:57:06.138 --> 00:57:12.010]  And... These are people that used race-based politics before, but it failed in the 50s and 60s.
[00:57:13.755 --> 00:57:18.238]  And so now they're desperate trying to do it from a minority perspective because you're the majority.
[00:57:18.438 --> 00:57:28.604]  And if they can sell a racist agenda on that, it'll work great because whites on average will still be per capita the wealthiest group because they had the brainchild of a system that made more money.
[00:57:29.005 --> 00:57:30.185]  They were taught to save money.
[00:57:30.986 --> 00:57:33.647]  Now they'll have to be protected by the political class.
[00:57:34.068 --> 00:57:40.532]  They will go into a hardened defense mode and a new apartheid will be set up over everyone else.
[00:57:41.823 --> 00:57:43.084]  And you're all walking into it.
[00:57:43.504 --> 00:57:45.186]  You're walking into a total trap.
[00:57:46.026 --> 00:57:52.191]  Then down the road, the apartheid system, it won't be called that, will be shut down and the whole civilization will be imploded.
[00:57:53.973 --> 00:57:55.334]  Let me stop right there just briefly.

[00:58:50.851 --> 00:58:52.152]  It's an info war after all.
[00:58:52.352 --> 00:58:53.993]  And you are on the front lines.
[00:58:55.394 --> 00:58:57.476]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:00.251 --> 00:59:03.193]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:59:03.493 --> 00:59:13.080]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[00:59:49.104 --> 00:59:50.205]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:12.893 --> 01:00:18.918]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:19.519 --> 01:00:22.541]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:24.302 --> 01:00:29.667]  We've got Rob Dew and Josh Owens out in Germany, covering Bilderberg and the migrant camps.
[01:00:29.747 --> 01:00:30.788]  They're coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:30.808 --> 01:00:37.073]  We've got a bunch of our crew, including Leanne McAdoo and Joe Biggs out on the West Coast for the anti-free speech hysteria there.
[01:00:37.093 --> 01:00:39.155]  We've got a bunch of other crew being sent out.
[01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:41.717]  I am skeleton crew here.
[01:00:42.827 --> 01:00:50.949]  And I'm not literally likening myself to Hitler, except for the fact that I'm in my bunker and have limited forces and I'm trying to give orders to armies that don't exist.
[01:00:51.249 --> 01:00:53.369]  But there is so much I want to do.
[01:00:53.969 --> 01:00:55.429]  We're working seven days a week right now.
[01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:57.110]  I worked seven days this week.
[01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:59.890]  Nico Acosta worked seven days a week.
[01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:00.550]  Ali did.
[01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:03.211]  Matt, this whole great crew back here.
[01:01:03.231 --> 01:01:06.892]  So I just want to single them out for your support, your prayers.
[01:01:09.036 --> 01:01:12.098]  You name it, because people send me all this fan mail, big stacks of it every week.
[01:01:12.259 --> 01:01:12.799]  I appreciate it.
[01:01:12.859 --> 01:01:13.319]  I look at it.
[01:01:13.379 --> 01:01:13.760]  It's great.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:14.520]  All these gifts.
[01:01:15.081 --> 01:01:17.442]  Hey, think about the crew, reporters or whoever.
[01:01:17.843 --> 01:01:22.666]  Everybody should adopt somebody on the crew and just tell them, you know, what you think about them, because we love you.
[01:01:22.927 --> 01:01:24.608]  You can hear from us that we care about you.
[01:01:24.628 --> 01:01:31.853]  I just also just thought that's another way to point out how important this crew is and the work they're doing now.
[01:01:32.816 --> 01:01:33.876]  It just hit me during the break.
[01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:44.181]  Something that I know, but that I really need to say loud and clear and say it a lot, and something that I'm going to advise Roger Stone to do the next time he talks to Donald Trump.
[01:01:45.621 --> 01:01:49.403]  Or the next time that, let's just say I'm able to talk to folks with the campaign.
[01:01:51.344 --> 01:01:51.864]  But before
[01:01:53.436 --> 01:01:53.796]  I do that.
[01:01:53.836 --> 01:02:00.838]  I just want to get Darren McBreen's attention, who has taken on, you know, the job of like three or four more people while the crew's out of town.
[01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:03.178]  And that goes for Jakari and everybody else.
[01:02:03.218 --> 01:02:10.960]  They're all just really upping their game even more to help get all the videos out, the reports, the research, the articles, just everybody in this crew.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:15.361]  But it really hit me during that 70-second break, and it's so profound.
[01:02:15.381 --> 01:02:19.662]  You know, a thought can be in just a split second, but it's like a volume of material.
[01:02:19.682 --> 01:02:21.603]  So I'll try to crystallize this down.
[01:02:24.383 --> 01:02:28.746]  The most powerful weapon Donald Trump has isn't just that he's anti-political correct.
[01:02:30.287 --> 01:02:31.948]  It isn't that he just speaks like a common person.
[01:02:31.968 --> 01:02:34.349]  It isn't that he's just pushing basic common sense populism.
[01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:49.058]  It's that currently at his rallies that I've seen the raw footage of that we have on Infowars.com, it's got to be a third or 40% of the people going in the doors are Hispanic.
[01:02:51.761 --> 01:02:55.966]  And it's gotta be 10, 20, 30% are black.
[01:02:57.288 --> 01:02:58.129]  And a lot are Asian.
[01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:04.717]  Now, this is so exciting because they have pushed this racism narrative to the thousandth degree.
[01:03:06.067 --> 01:03:07.487]  And quite frankly, people are scared.
[01:03:07.507 --> 01:03:08.748]  There's a little bit of xenophobia going on.
[01:03:08.788 --> 01:03:14.650]  That's pretty much common sense at a point when people are saying, ah, foreign flags, we're gonna get you, ah, kill you, and the government's running.
[01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:20.432]  And I mean, people that haven't been, quote, racist are getting a little, just a little bit, hey, I'm scared, which I wouldn't call racism.
[01:03:20.492 --> 01:03:21.992]  It's just called normal tribalism.
[01:03:22.352 --> 01:03:23.573]  That starts getting activated.
[01:03:25.433 --> 01:03:30.275]  And so Trump pushed a little bit of those buttons, let's be honest about it, because the left's pushing them on their side.
[01:03:31.115 --> 01:03:32.055]  And I'm not even defending that.
[01:03:32.075 --> 01:03:33.416]  I think he went a little too far sometimes.
[01:03:34.401 --> 01:03:36.704]  But that's just because I just straight shoot, folks.
[01:03:36.764 --> 01:03:38.666]  I can't sit here and think up what I'm going to say.
[01:03:38.686 --> 01:03:40.609]  It's just whatever I'm really thinking, you get it.
[01:03:40.649 --> 01:03:43.212]  There is no filter with me to a really bad point.
[01:03:43.472 --> 01:03:47.958]  Because if I want to use cuss words, I've never been a big cusser, but now I get really upset about things, I will start cussing.
[01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:52.143]  And they have to delay it out because it's just, I'm so real.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:58.563]  That when they got Salon pushing pedophilia in one article and then saying, I'm a liar in the other.
[01:03:58.643 --> 01:04:00.124]  Listen, you people, I'm tired of you.
[01:04:00.745 --> 01:04:02.005]  I mean, I've really had enough of it.
[01:04:02.406 --> 01:04:03.667]  I really disdain you.
[01:04:04.167 --> 01:04:04.847]  I detest you.
[01:04:04.867 --> 01:04:08.170]  But, but it's a complex thought, but super simple.
[01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:10.151]  I want to try to just put it out there as best I can.
[01:04:12.653 --> 01:04:17.536]  The fact that they've done everything they can for 10 years to say the Tea Party is racist.
[01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:26.114]  was very successful last four or five years at almost having no quote minorities at Tea Party events.
[01:04:26.494 --> 01:04:34.138]  When I can tell you the Tea Party is a libertarian based grassroots pro-human overall movement.
[01:04:36.823 --> 01:04:47.804]  And the fact that the media could brand it, that minorities aren't welcome there, and then they don't go, and then minorities see there's no minorities there, that is how you run a con job.
[01:04:48.064 --> 01:04:49.126]  That's their greatest victory.
[01:04:50.034 --> 01:04:57.842]  Because now you've branded anything Americana, anything freedom-based, anything free market, pro-guine, whatever, as white and evil.
[01:04:58.823 --> 01:05:09.014]  You've just stolen a birthright from all these people and done a huge mind job on them and made all the white people think communism has a brown face.
[01:05:11.044 --> 01:05:13.646]  A new tell-all book is shocking the Hillary campaign.
[01:05:13.806 --> 01:05:19.951]  Crisis of Character, a White House Secret Service officer discloses his first-hand experience with Hillary, Bill, and how they operate.
[01:05:19.971 --> 01:05:25.075]  It was written by former Secret Service agent Gary Byrne, who was posted outside the Oval Office during the Clinton years.
[01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:28.878]  The book reveals the real personality of Hillary, not the fake one you see on TV.
[01:05:29.218 --> 01:05:32.942]  And it's already at number one at Amazon despite not being released until June 28th.
[01:05:33.123 --> 01:05:34.104]  But what's in the book?
[01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:39.570]  Well, it portrays Hillary as, quote, too erratic, uncontrollable, and occasionally violent to become president.
[01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:43.394]  Byrne describes Hillary as acting friendly one moment, then raging the next.
[01:05:43.775 --> 01:05:48.821]  In fact, Secret Service agents discussed the possibility they would have to protect Bill from his wife's physical attacks.
[01:05:49.201 --> 01:05:53.183]  And the couple had one violent encounter the morning of a key presidential address to the nation.
[01:05:53.463 --> 01:06:02.066]  Byrne wrote, quote, Hillary Clinton is now poised to become the Democratic nominee for the President of the United States, but she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office.
[01:06:02.406 --> 01:06:04.647]  From the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true.
[01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:07.728]  And you can find out more at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:07.808 --> 01:06:08.989]  This is Keith Daniels reporting.
[01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:18.290]  I got so busy fighting the globalists for 15 years, I turned into a giant fat slob when I was an exercise fanatic before.
[01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:21.792]  Now in the last five years, I set out to try to get back in shape.
[01:06:22.192 --> 01:06:34.040]  And to help turbocharge that, I talked to top scientists and nutraceutical developers and said, I want something that blocks these estrogen mimickers, something that helps me get back to what a real male was like instead of this globalist bombardment.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.401]  We developed Super Male and Super Female Vitality.

[01:08:22.642 --> 01:08:27.786]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:08:28.306 --> 01:08:33.711]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:08:33.811 --> 01:08:39.175]  Coming up, why is there suddenly such a huge push for Mark of the Beast technology?
[01:08:39.635 --> 01:08:42.057]  Michael Schneider of the American Dream blog asked that question.
[01:08:42.457 --> 01:08:44.099]  Story's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:45.039 --> 01:08:49.623]  And I'm glad somebody pointed that out, because I used to harp on this 20 years ago, 15 years ago, made films about it.
[01:08:50.934 --> 01:08:53.176]  Now it is just all over the news.
[01:08:53.276 --> 01:08:56.599]  ABC News, NBC News, Fox News, like microchips for your kids.
[01:08:56.659 --> 01:08:57.580]  You know it's inevitable.
[01:08:58.141 --> 01:08:59.021]  That's the talking point.
[01:08:59.442 --> 01:09:08.690]  Because they're getting rid of cash, they're bringing in this control grid, they're going to use flooded borders, massive Al Qaeda, ISIS sleeper cell attacks in the future to push this idea.
[01:09:09.150 --> 01:09:14.755]  Huge identity theft scandals where governments and big corporations dump your identities out there by design
[01:09:15.416 --> 01:09:23.063]  So that you've got to be face scanned or biometrically identified to make sure your credit card or number is really being used by you.
[01:09:23.423 --> 01:09:29.468]  That will then also be an internet ID and be used to track, trace and control everything you do.
[01:09:30.809 --> 01:09:32.551]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[01:09:33.832 --> 01:09:38.616]  But then on top of that, they'll be able to kick you off the internet with three strikes.
[01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:42.126]  And then your identity will basically be gone.
[01:09:42.646 --> 01:09:44.408]  No one will be able to basically speak for you.
[01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:45.770]  They will have total control.
[01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:50.976]  That is their admitted master jewel in the crown plan.
[01:09:51.877 --> 01:09:58.565]  And boy, I tell you, if John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos envisioning all of this 2,000 years ago wasn't
[01:10:01.829 --> 01:10:08.314]  Psychic, time traveler, super clairvoyant, you know, given a vision by God.
[01:10:08.774 --> 01:10:12.958]  He was one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:20.263]  No, no one started writing science fiction like that for the last 60, 70 years, folks.
[01:10:21.484 --> 01:10:22.445]  He wrote it 2,000 years ago.
[01:10:26.357 --> 01:10:26.958]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:10:27.178 --> 01:10:32.702]  Depeche Mode has a song making fun of him saying he stole his God from the Muslims.
[01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:42.351]  The Muslims didn't exist for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years until after he died.
[01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:49.136]  In fact, can we go out with John the Revelator, put him in an elevator, take him up to the higher?
[01:10:49.156 --> 01:10:50.678]  You know what's funny though?
[01:10:51.854 --> 01:10:52.615]  I love Depeche Mode.
[01:10:52.635 --> 01:10:54.736]  Incredible artist, great music, one of my favorite bands.
[01:10:55.097 --> 01:11:01.142]  It's just, I hate it when I'm singing along to a song that sounds so good, I love it, when it's a lie!
[01:11:01.442 --> 01:11:02.143]  But you know what?
[01:11:02.223 --> 01:11:03.564]  It feels good, doesn't it?
[01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:14.193]  John the Revelator couldn't even hardly walk while he was having those visions.
[01:11:15.594 --> 01:11:16.054]  For days.
[01:11:17.415 --> 01:11:20.138]  By the way, you read about Ezekiel in Ezekiel.
[01:11:21.084 --> 01:11:25.305]  This was written 3,000 years ago, at least.
[01:11:27.246 --> 01:11:39.028]  And he sees giant craft with four spinning wheels of fire land and huge blue craft come off with crystal coverings over their heads and blue skin.
[01:11:39.048 --> 01:11:40.769]  He gets on his knee.
[01:11:42.606 --> 01:11:50.133]  And the angel tells him, take this, so you understand him, he takes this pill, and then has these visions.
[01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:51.934]  I mean, what is that?
[01:11:53.916 --> 01:12:01.603]  And it's all hiding in plain view, and the churches all go, oh, we'll explain that, it's all figurative, and we don't want anyone to lose, don't go there, okay, ha ha.
[01:12:01.923 --> 01:12:04.546]  That's what the masons at the higher level are covering up, folks.
[01:12:06.735 --> 01:12:08.441]  Because the public they don't think can handle it all.
[01:12:08.522 --> 01:12:09.706]  And I'm not even going there.
[01:12:09.887 --> 01:12:12.456]  I'm just saying this is what the elite actually believe.
[01:12:18.559 --> 01:12:42.080]  And a guy 2,000 years ago said, when you start seeing this, look out, they're going to set up a world government with 10 sub-regions, 3 mega-regions, and this number of leaders that give their power to a God-man who will be seen everywhere in the town squares and in the homes as a 3D creature that is see-through.
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:43.201]  Holograms.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.762]  The next rollout, the next televisions are all hologram based.
[01:12:47.802 --> 01:12:49.082]  It's all happening.
[01:12:49.623 --> 01:12:53.905]  Speaking of technology, we take you now live to Germany.
[01:12:54.105 --> 01:12:55.125]  Do we have the guys in place yet?
[01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:00.648]  They're a little bit late getting in place where they are.
[01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:01.489]  They were in Dresden.
[01:13:02.069 --> 01:13:02.669]  Yes, they're there.
[01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:04.110]  We've got the feed.
[01:13:04.450 --> 01:13:09.573]  Let's let them get in place and then as soon as it's ready, give me a roger, okay?
[01:13:12.155 --> 01:13:12.715]  Copy that, good.
[01:13:14.534 --> 01:13:21.079]  Think about somebody a hundred years ago, a thousand years ago, watching a slash radio show, InfoWars.
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.881]  It's radio you watch.
[01:13:24.342 --> 01:13:34.591]  And I would say that I would be in studio in Austin talking to anybody that wanted to dial in in the world that has the technology, that's ubiquitous, and that we could be in Dresden, Germany at a nationalist rally.
[01:13:36.135 --> 01:13:38.497]  We're going to see if these are all white supremacists like we've been told.
[01:13:38.517 --> 01:13:40.258]  I don't see one white supremacist there.
[01:13:40.478 --> 01:13:50.104]  If you don't want your country wide open, people coming in that rape your women, telling you you've got to submit to them, I don't see any, any, any Nazi regalia except for that skull and bones flag.
[01:13:50.124 --> 01:13:55.108]  I don't know that's a Nazi flag, but usually the death set is associated with that.
[01:13:55.128 --> 01:13:56.569]  So we'll see exactly what it says.
[01:13:56.589 --> 01:14:03.173]  Probably be the Fed there to discredit them, because if there's one of those flags there, Merkel then claims she can shut down the whole event.
[01:14:03.693 --> 01:14:05.915]  But then she's gone further than that, just shutting them down, period.
[01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:09.292]  And reactivating the Stasi.
[01:14:10.594 --> 01:14:19.466]  I see some state flags, I see some... We're going to go to them live here in just a moment.
[01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:22.290]  Get on your radio listener, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:14:23.703 --> 01:14:28.026]  And then coming up, I'm going to get to the attacks on free speech here in the United States that are intensifying.
[01:14:28.146 --> 01:14:39.653]  I'm going to get into Hillary Clinton obviously in deep trouble with another Secret Service agent with a book coming out that basically documents everything that an FBI agent 16, 17 years ago said he witnessed there.
[01:14:39.673 --> 01:14:43.555]  Remember the crack pipes, the Mao Zedong stuff hanging on the Christmas tree?
[01:14:43.575 --> 01:14:44.796]  People said, that's crazy.
[01:14:45.096 --> 01:14:47.277]  And then later the White House said, okay, we did it just for fun.
[01:14:47.317 --> 01:14:47.818]  It's a joke.
[01:14:48.398 --> 01:14:53.221]  Just like Google a few weeks ago had Mao Zedong stuff on its front page celebrating Mao Zedong.
[01:14:54.798 --> 01:14:55.518]  On their front page.
[01:14:55.799 --> 01:14:58.260]  You know, on December 25th they show a Christmas tree, not a cross.
[01:15:00.041 --> 01:15:03.883]  But when it's a Mao Zedong holiday, they show us Mao Zedong worship.
[01:15:04.503 --> 01:15:05.884]  A guy that killed 80 plus million people.
[01:15:06.084 --> 01:15:07.585]  I mean, how freakazoid is that?
[01:15:09.026 --> 01:15:09.967]  Can't show a cross.
[01:15:10.747 --> 01:15:12.248]  We can show you Mao Zedong.
[01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:16.890]  Can't have you a little drummer boy.
[01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:20.913]  We can have us some Mao Zedong.
[01:15:22.025 --> 01:15:24.386]  Greatest murderer in history of his own people!
[01:15:25.126 --> 01:15:30.808]  I'd actually see news articles going, Alex Jones was bashing Mao Tse-Tung and the Communist Chinese again today, because he doesn't like Asians.
[01:15:31.168 --> 01:15:34.289]  Yeah, I don't like a guy that killed 84 million Asians.
[01:15:35.569 --> 01:15:36.870]  And I'm not going to use my race card.
[01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:38.910]  People are like, who is this Korean girl?
[01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:40.791]  You say your sister is suddenly on TV with you?
[01:15:40.831 --> 01:15:41.411]  We didn't know that.
[01:15:41.831 --> 01:15:44.532]  Well, that's because in my 20 years on air, I might have said it 10, 15 times.
[01:15:45.332 --> 01:15:46.353]  Because it's not a race card.
[01:15:46.393 --> 01:15:46.953]  It's my sister.
[01:15:47.133 --> 01:15:47.533]  Adopted.
[01:15:48.985 --> 01:15:50.485]  I just, oh, I'm so sick of it all.
[01:15:50.505 --> 01:15:51.586]  I'm so tired of it.
[01:15:51.606 --> 01:15:52.966]  It's such idiocy.
[01:15:53.506 --> 01:15:55.486]  You kill 84 million Asians, you're a great guy.
[01:15:55.686 --> 01:15:56.887]  You're against it, you're a racist.
[01:15:57.947 --> 01:15:58.787]  We've lost our Skype feed.
[01:15:58.807 --> 01:16:00.387]  We're going to get back up in a moment and go to them.
[01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:13.850]  Before I go any further, though, obviously, it is extremely expensive to have Rob Dew and Josh Owens and Paul Watson, who's about to be there, in Germany.
[01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:17.791]  This is a news organization of over 50 people now.
[01:16:19.929 --> 01:16:29.874]  And I need to really get a couple more camera folks, and I need to get some more editors to be able to just get the bottleneck done, and also a few more writers to go through all the news we're gathering and actually get it out there.
[01:16:29.894 --> 01:16:35.357]  We'll have bombshell stuff, but just, you know, throw up 15 videos in one article and not even have time to look at them.
[01:16:35.397 --> 01:16:36.537]  Just, this is incredible!
[01:16:36.777 --> 01:16:39.959]  And there's just unbelievable gold exposing the New World Order there, but...
[01:16:41.243 --> 01:16:49.650]  That's why we need listeners to go through everything we do, and flag it for us, and help us, and post it to other sites, and write articles about it, and put it on other video sites.
[01:16:51.152 --> 01:17:04.984]  So many times, folks, you'll take one of our videos off our YouTube channel, or our Facebook channel, or our Daily Motion channel, you'll post it on your little YouTube channel that might have had 100,000 views over the years, and it'll get 10 million views, because they've got algorithms in there blocking our videos.
[01:17:06.625 --> 01:17:08.067]  Yes, we have a monetized YouTube channel.
[01:17:09.218 --> 01:17:18.305]  It doesn't pay for, it might pay for four days of operation a month.
[01:17:19.386 --> 01:17:27.391]  It might pay for the money I gotta spend, that channel with, I mean we're talking 25, 30 million views a month on one channel, conservatively.
[01:17:29.313 --> 01:17:31.935]  And it might pay to run this office three, four days.
[01:17:33.561 --> 01:17:37.783]  The money we make each month off YouTube helps fund a few days, maybe two or three.
[01:17:37.803 --> 01:17:38.663]  Okay?
[01:17:38.924 --> 01:17:40.304]  That's the nut I've got to crack.
[01:17:40.584 --> 01:17:42.105]  And by the way, I'm not complaining.
[01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:43.866]  We do this in Texas where it's inexpensive.
[01:17:44.406 --> 01:17:46.007]  You know, we try to pay our people decent though.
[01:17:48.268 --> 01:17:51.289]  I need everybody to go to m4warrestore.com and buy a Hillary for Prison shirt.
[01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:59.313]  Why would you not do it when this witch is trying to take the country over and destroy free speech and in-talk radio and the internet as we know it, and saying she wants to ban guns today?
[01:17:59.333 --> 01:17:59.954]  I've got the video.
[01:18:00.834 --> 01:18:02.615]  Saying that, you know, the government can restrict them.
[01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:05.630]  As if they haven't already done it enough.
[01:18:08.391 --> 01:18:11.592]  So go to InfoWareStore.com, get the limited edition Heller for Prison shirt.
[01:18:12.692 --> 01:18:18.693]  We also have two specials on the Alexa Pure Breeze that the sale ends 26% off.
[01:18:18.733 --> 01:18:19.513]  That ends today.
[01:18:19.533 --> 01:18:24.554]  It'll still be a great deal at, you know, 220-something bucks, but it's over 25% off right now.
[01:18:24.634 --> 01:18:26.255]  Four-stage filtration system.
[01:18:27.475 --> 01:18:27.855]  It is.
[01:18:30.158 --> 01:18:33.121]  $184.99 and the profit we make helps fund this operation.
[01:18:33.361 --> 01:18:37.264]  The air is so toxic, folks, you're crazy if you don't get one of these and put one in every room if you can afford it.
[01:18:37.805 --> 01:18:40.827]  We also, this is the last day for 20% off on lung cleanse.
[01:18:41.809 --> 01:18:44.530]  Because it will sell out today, as I predicted.
[01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:45.671]  We won't get more in for a month.
[01:18:46.151 --> 01:18:49.932]  It's an amazing essential oil combination that is the best out there, in my view.
[01:18:50.272 --> 01:18:56.295]  And when my throat's scratchy, or I've got a sore throat, whatever, it works better than anything I've ever tried before, and I'm in broadcasting.
[01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:57.055]  I've tried a lot of stuff.
[01:18:57.415 --> 01:19:00.877]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:19:01.037 --> 01:19:03.738]  Tell Dewey he's got four minutes.
[01:19:03.878 --> 01:19:06.859]  We're going to go to break, and when I'm going to come back, I'm going to write to him.
[01:19:08.587 --> 01:19:11.369]  So, again, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:13.311]  Brain Force is excellent as well.
[01:19:13.331 --> 01:19:14.451]  You've heard the rave reviews of that.
[01:19:14.531 --> 01:19:15.772]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:19:16.213 --> 01:19:17.013]  Secret 12.
[01:19:17.574 --> 01:19:22.197]  Most people don't absorb vitamin B12 in the gut anymore because of the toxicity, all the chemicals, the GMOs.
[01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:23.978]  For whatever reason, look up the studies.
[01:19:24.399 --> 01:19:27.341]  But if you put it under your tongue for about a minute, you absorb a lot of it.
[01:19:27.381 --> 01:19:28.262]  Almost like it's a shot.
[01:19:29.096 --> 01:19:31.677]  And this is the exact stuff people inject, but I don't inject this.
[01:19:31.717 --> 01:19:32.457]  It's not designed for that.
[01:19:32.757 --> 01:19:33.818]  It's methylcobalamin.
[01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:41.240]  80% of its status, another acetylcobalamin, or however you pronounce it, is the top type that helps you absorb the other.
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.001]  So it's designed for maximum absorption.
[01:19:44.281 --> 01:19:45.321]  Sign up for AutoShip.
[01:19:45.922 --> 01:19:49.563]  Get 10% off on the additional specials that are already running.

[01:19:59.967 --> 01:20:02.851]  Our reporters live from Dresden, Germany.
[01:20:03.252 --> 01:20:07.438]  Straight ahead at the site of a nationalist rally which Merkel has said is illegal.
[01:20:07.738 --> 01:20:09.320]  These are people braving threat of arrest.
[01:20:10.424 --> 01:20:23.128]  This message is not just addressed to my fellow Americans, but addressed to people across the world of every race, color, and creed who believe in free speech, enshrined here in our republic as the First Amendment.
[01:20:23.788 --> 01:20:27.189]  It's the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights because it is the most important.
[01:20:27.209 --> 01:20:31.970]  The right to speak, the right to publish, the right to assemble, the right to petition, the right to
[01:20:32.230 --> 01:20:36.172]  Practice your own religion and not having a state run or authorized system.
[01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:45.616]  We have seen Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other media platforms increasingly censor even mainline libertarian and conservative ideas.
[01:20:45.896 --> 01:20:57.441]  Ladies and gentlemen, Facebook, if it's able to successfully get away with censoring a wide spectrum of ideas that the establishment doesn't agree with, not just conservatives, will set a mega massive precedent.
[01:20:57.941 --> 01:20:59.441]  Facebook's over a third of the internet.
[01:20:59.601 --> 01:21:00.142]  You think about that?
[01:21:00.642 --> 01:21:02.082]  Of the traffic and people visiting things.
[01:21:02.502 --> 01:21:03.102]  And then it's over.
[01:21:03.422 --> 01:21:07.723]  You think it's bad that communist China with a billion, 300 million people is censoring?
[01:21:08.564 --> 01:21:15.805]  Zuckerberg, who calls his users dumb effers, has been meeting with the Chinese censorship leadership, openly trying to tweak it.
[01:21:15.925 --> 01:21:20.867]  He met with Merkel, and openly in a hot mic, said, don't worry, I'm going to start suppressing and censoring people.
[01:21:21.007 --> 01:21:25.468]  They report when someone criticizes open borders to the German government, and they come and arrest you.
[01:21:25.628 --> 01:21:26.428]  This is a global
[01:21:27.108 --> 01:21:29.609]  This is the worst phenomenon that's taking place right now.
[01:21:29.789 --> 01:21:33.870]  They're passing laws in Canada to arrest people that criticize transgender.
[01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:35.230]  Well, that's your free speech!
[01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:37.991]  It's not hate propaganda as they call it.
[01:21:38.291 --> 01:21:44.893]  If they set the precedent on these issues, they will basically ban any other type of speech that the globalists don't want.
[01:21:44.973 --> 01:21:47.093]  This is the ultimate threat to humanity.
[01:21:47.493 --> 01:21:49.654]  This is worse than what we saw in the Soviet Union.
[01:21:50.074 --> 01:21:53.835]  This is right out of Nazi Germany or right out of Maoist China.
[01:21:54.255 --> 01:21:55.595]  So we're fighting for free speech.
[01:21:55.935 --> 01:22:05.997]  When you spread the word about InfoWars.com, our videos, our stories, our reports, and when you post it on different platforms, that circumvents their AI systems that are trying to restrict the flow of information.
[01:22:06.137 --> 01:22:08.078]  We stand together or we hang separate.
[01:22:08.258 --> 01:22:13.138]  Another thing we're doing is not just battling to stop the censorship, we're also building other platforms.
[01:22:13.559 --> 01:22:21.300]  Getting on as many third-party systems as there are out there and spreading the word of basic free market liberty and human empowerment and the new renaissance.
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:25.141]  But also the experts I've talked to said, Alex, you missed the boat.
[01:22:25.161 --> 01:22:28.643]  You've been a pioneer in many ways, but you haven't promoted email.
[01:22:28.663 --> 01:22:30.824]  And I said, yeah, I don't ever really market on email.
[01:22:30.924 --> 01:22:32.745]  I just, I just, it's low tech.
[01:22:32.925 --> 01:22:33.725]  And they're like, no, no, no.
[01:22:33.765 --> 01:22:35.246]  That's what's going to be hard to censor.
[01:22:35.306 --> 01:22:48.431]  Even if the internet kill switch comes into place, there are systems and there are developments that make it very hard still to stop email and to stop that information being sent over networks, you name it.
[01:22:48.511 --> 01:22:49.912]  So it's essential.
[01:22:50.892 --> 01:23:02.135]  That everybody go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter to get exclusive articles, videos, promo code sometimes, the shopping cart like we had a few weeks ago with Hillary for prison, 50% off.
[01:23:02.436 --> 01:23:07.277]  I mean there are some big discounts we send to incentivize people and plus you're some of the most hardcore patriots.
[01:23:07.577 --> 01:23:11.918]  You can send the email and the newsletter on with exclusive videos and articles many days.
[01:23:12.579 --> 01:23:13.519]  So that's another great reason.
[01:23:13.539 --> 01:23:19.861]  But overall, it's so that we have direct contact with fellow patriots out there around the world.
[01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:29.064]  And if they try to start shutting our websites down and other things, which they've tried to do, and kick us off Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, you name it, we'll be able to send you direct videos
[01:23:29.764 --> 01:23:31.665]  That you can then send on to others.
[01:23:32.325 --> 01:23:51.616]  We've all got to start thinking about censorship and actively fighting it, getting more active and not taking independent liberty-based media for granted, which I know you don't do, but really having a sense of urgency and getting the info out more while building new avenues on cutting-edge tech and cutting-edge platforms, but also old tech like email.
[01:23:51.876 --> 01:23:52.937]  So please join
[01:23:53.817 --> 01:23:59.260]  Hundreds of thousands of others that have been signing up every few months at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:08.705]  And you can also spread the word about our free feeds and more podcasts, Android apps, iPhone apps, it's all free at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:24:20.612 --> 01:24:25.098]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:25.259 --> 01:24:26.000]  Alright!
[01:24:33.031 --> 01:24:34.252]  Rob Dew is in Dresden.
[01:24:34.272 --> 01:24:38.053]  They've just started meeting at the town center and have just started marching.
[01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:43.635]  And they're, I'm told, going to be marching into some of the illegal alien invasion centers.
[01:24:44.296 --> 01:24:54.680]  We've had the German police and security forces try to tell Dew and crew they're not allowed to interview people or allowed to cover things, even from outside the refugee centers.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.580]  This is the attack on free speech.
[01:24:56.921 --> 01:24:58.561]  We now take you to Rob Dew.
[01:24:58.621 --> 01:25:00.182]  Rob Dew, thank you for joining us.
[01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:02.964]  How was your trip to Germany, and what have you witnessed so far?
[01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:05.426]  Well, I feel like I haven't slept much.
[01:25:05.446 --> 01:25:06.767]  We've been doing a lot of traveling.
[01:25:06.787 --> 01:25:10.991]  We started off in Munich, and as you saw from the video yesterday, we went to one of the migrant centers.
[01:25:11.011 --> 01:25:13.593]  We went to a couple, and there weren't any people outside.
[01:25:13.893 --> 01:25:16.395]  The third one we went to, there were several people outside.
[01:25:16.415 --> 01:25:22.841]  We went and tried to talk to two men from Afghanistan, fighting-age men, of course, young men, and immediately the staff
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:27.621]  Tore out of the building at us, started screaming at us, grabbing us, pushing our cameras down.
[01:25:28.102 --> 01:25:29.662]  It was a pretty hostile situation.
[01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:36.444]  We happened to be with an activist named Michael Studenberger, who's with the Free German Party.
[01:25:37.385 --> 01:25:39.105]  A very small group, but very anti-immigration.
[01:25:39.125 --> 01:25:43.067]  In fact, he was just speaking at the event here in this town square.
[01:25:43.567 --> 01:25:46.788]  You could see he was flanked by women wearing hijabs.
[01:25:47.608 --> 01:25:48.649]  Obviously, they were fake.
[01:25:48.669 --> 01:25:49.869]  They were there for protesting.
[01:25:50.424 --> 01:25:53.045]  But now it looks like everybody's about to march around the city.
[01:25:53.465 --> 01:25:55.925]  There's a lot of flags, a lot of German flags.
[01:25:56.465 --> 01:25:59.246]  I think, not sure what that is, that might be a Bavarian flag.
[01:25:59.386 --> 01:26:03.707]  I also see, I also see Merkel depicted as a Nazi, so I haven't seen any... Exactly.
[01:26:03.727 --> 01:26:05.087]  Any Nazi flags.
[01:26:06.007 --> 01:26:08.667]  I did shoot a, I shot a quick video of that.
[01:26:09.168 --> 01:26:09.828]  Merkel as a Nazi.
[01:26:09.848 --> 01:26:12.848]  There's a guy wearing a shirt right there as Merkel as a Nazi.
[01:26:12.948 --> 01:26:14.969]  Maybe we can get a close-up shot of him.
[01:26:14.989 --> 01:26:16.629]  There's a sign right there, Josh, see the sign?
[01:26:17.011 --> 01:26:17.591]  Yes, I see it.
[01:26:17.611 --> 01:26:18.052]  Good job.
[01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:22.394]  Did you have any trouble getting into Germany when you told them you were there to cover Bilderberg?
[01:26:23.375 --> 01:26:23.555]  No.
[01:26:23.775 --> 01:26:25.196]  No one has said anything yet.
[01:26:25.216 --> 01:26:28.077]  In fact, when we went through customs, it was, uh, how long are you going to be here?
[01:26:28.097 --> 01:26:29.798]  Um, where are you going?
[01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:30.439]  And that was it.
[01:26:30.579 --> 01:26:31.740]  They didn't really want to know much more.
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.201]  And so they, uh, they sent us on our way.
[01:26:34.521 --> 01:26:35.662]  Have had no problems yet.
[01:26:35.682 --> 01:26:38.003]  We are checking into the Hotel Bilderberg this afternoon.
[01:26:38.043 --> 01:26:40.164]  We just arrived into Dresden.
[01:26:40.204 --> 01:26:44.547]  We had a long, it was a little bit longer drive than we thought from Nuremberg to, um,
[01:26:45.734 --> 01:26:46.595]  Nuremberg 2, Dresden.
[01:26:46.635 --> 01:26:48.656]  But, we did have an interesting interview today.
[01:26:48.696 --> 01:26:53.459]  We stopped in a small town of about 40,000 people, where they house about 1,000 migrants.
[01:26:53.559 --> 01:26:58.061]  Illegal invaders brought in by the EU to break the border.
[01:26:58.081 --> 01:26:58.402]  Go ahead.
[01:26:59.242 --> 01:26:59.702]  Exactly.
[01:27:00.243 --> 01:27:01.163]  Josh, if you can make it up here.
[01:27:02.819 --> 01:27:07.583]  We stopped and talked, and this time we went and talked to him, and one of the guys spoke English, and he talked to us.
[01:27:07.623 --> 01:27:09.665]  We did a 25 minute interview that we're about to post.
[01:27:09.685 --> 01:27:15.810]  We're going to post half of it, and then right now, edit it down, and then we're going to post the rest in a couple days.
[01:27:16.090 --> 01:27:19.653]  But his name was Mohammed, and he was from Syria, and most of the people there were from Syria.
[01:27:20.325 --> 01:27:25.247]  And he explained why most of the men that were fighting age that were coming in from his point of view.
[01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:30.688]  He also had some interesting things to say about Assad and how he is treated by the German people.
[01:27:31.088 --> 01:27:32.809]  He said, we're looked down on.
[01:27:32.829 --> 01:27:33.789]  We don't feel welcome here.
[01:27:34.730 --> 01:27:36.750]  And I said, well, so what do you get?
[01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:38.011]  And they go, well, we get free housing.
[01:27:38.051 --> 01:27:38.731]  We get free food.
[01:27:38.751 --> 01:27:39.991]  We don't have to worry about anything.
[01:27:40.391 --> 01:27:41.572]  But I don't really like it here.
[01:27:43.004 --> 01:27:47.425]  You're giving these people pretty much everything to live, and they still are not happy.
[01:27:47.866 --> 01:27:51.547]  But he said he does want to integrate, and he is for, you know, people integrating.
[01:27:51.567 --> 01:27:59.249]  So it's a long interview, and I think this will put to rest any notion that, you know, InfoWars is this racist opposition, we're just screaming at people.
[01:27:59.669 --> 01:28:00.510]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:01.690]  That's fine.
[01:28:02.170 --> 01:28:04.411]  No one is ever going to stop saying that, no matter what we do.
[01:28:04.851 --> 01:28:07.352]  So that's fine to show the big long form things and be fair.
[01:28:07.992 --> 01:28:14.015]  The truth is, some of these immigrants aren't bad people, but they're being brought in to bring down the civilization.
[01:28:14.075 --> 01:28:15.136]  It's a globalist project.
[01:28:15.376 --> 01:28:18.377]  So they always make it about the people themselves instead of why it's being done.
[01:28:18.878 --> 01:28:20.519]  And so we're big picture.
[01:28:20.579 --> 01:28:21.299]  That's what we're doing.
[01:28:21.539 --> 01:28:24.441]  The truth is, you're not even allowed to go to Saudi Arabia, Rob.
[01:28:24.461 --> 01:28:26.181]  Okay, and wear a cross around your neck.
[01:28:26.502 --> 01:28:28.623]  They have police that will come up and tell you, cover it up.
[01:28:29.083 --> 01:28:34.786]  So these people aren't inclusive to us, and we're not here to pay for everything, because the EU wants to break our countries.
[01:28:35.905 --> 01:28:38.826]  Yes, totally agree with you Alex, 100% with you on there.
[01:28:39.346 --> 01:28:46.389]  And from what I'm gathering, this happens every first Monday of the month, is what you can see is going on right now.
[01:28:46.449 --> 01:28:52.092]  People mass demonstrating against the anti-immigration, anti-migration policy.
[01:28:52.752 --> 01:28:56.154]  By the way, I don't see any skinheads, any Nazi flags.
[01:28:56.614 --> 01:28:57.514]  These are like normal people.
[01:28:58.474 --> 01:28:59.755]  What does this sign say in English?
[01:29:05.023 --> 01:29:05.463]  Alright.
[01:29:05.644 --> 01:29:07.745]  That's an anti-Bilderberger sign right there.
[01:29:08.766 --> 01:29:09.126]  Exactly.
[01:29:09.146 --> 01:29:09.687]  Oh yeah, we know.
[01:29:09.727 --> 01:29:10.387]  We're here to cover it.
[01:29:10.707 --> 01:29:11.768]  So good job.
[01:29:13.009 --> 01:29:15.031]  So you've got anti-globalists that get the program.
[01:29:15.051 --> 01:29:16.232]  You've got a bunch of nationalists.
[01:29:16.252 --> 01:29:17.212]  People with state flags.
[01:29:17.533 --> 01:29:20.395]  I saw one that has a skull and crossbones and it says something on the top.
[01:29:20.835 --> 01:29:22.476]  That could be fascist related.
[01:29:22.677 --> 01:29:23.517]  But that's their right.
[01:29:23.998 --> 01:29:24.978]  If they have any free speech.
[01:29:24.998 --> 01:29:25.919]  But let's find out.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:27.260]  I saw at least two.
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.822]  There's one there and I'll see if I can find another one close by.
[01:29:29.842 --> 01:29:31.824]  I have a sneaky suspicion that's just some party.
[01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:37.581]  And I did see a couple of Nazi symbols with a slash through it right now.
[01:29:37.601 --> 01:29:38.942]  So you can see everybody's filing out now.
[01:29:38.962 --> 01:29:40.922]  They're going to march around the city.
[01:29:41.582 --> 01:29:47.064]  We also have an interview we did in the Munich train station with the free German party candidates about to come up.
[01:29:47.344 --> 01:29:50.025]  Those interviews take a little bit longer because we've been driving and editing.
[01:29:50.085 --> 01:29:52.005]  Dude, you've done a fabulous job.
[01:29:52.045 --> 01:29:56.606]  You guys get to the hotel now that that's been announced because they throw me out of there a week early now.
[01:29:56.867 --> 01:29:57.267]  Get in there.
[01:29:57.287 --> 01:29:58.187]  Get that intel.
[01:29:58.467 --> 01:29:59.387]  Go to the migrant camps.
[01:29:59.447 --> 01:30:00.468]  Great job.
[01:30:00.508 --> 01:30:01.088]  Stay there, my friend.
[01:30:01.108 --> 01:30:01.728]  We'll come back to you.
[01:30:05.589 --> 01:30:13.933]  I've been covering the news on radio and TV for more than 21 years.
[01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:22.276]  And as each year begins, you tend to see a theme that's developing with the social engineers, with the global architects.
[01:30:22.356 --> 01:30:29.639]  And undoubtedly, they're making their move to destabilize the Western world right now, from Australia to Europe to the United States and Canada.
[01:30:29.819 --> 01:30:30.619]  And they're bringing in
[01:30:30.899 --> 01:30:37.221]  Millions and millions of radical Islamic Muslims, unvetted, so that they will carry out terror attacks.
[01:30:37.421 --> 01:30:44.463]  And then when they do carry out terror attacks, we lose our liberties and freedoms and are told to comply with Islam and they'll stop bombing and shooting us.
[01:30:44.723 --> 01:30:46.744]  This is the crazy world of political correctness.
[01:30:47.324 --> 01:30:55.768]  That said, they allow Muslims to basically, in the United States and Europe, keep women as slaves chained up, beat them, pour acid on their faces, and they don't even really get in trouble.
[01:30:55.788 --> 01:31:02.411]  It's like, UN diplomats are always being caught with slaves from Africa and stuff, and they'll say, well that's their culture in this African country.
[01:31:02.611 --> 01:31:05.392]  But if it's Western culture, it's evil and it's bad.
[01:31:05.993 --> 01:31:13.116]  And going over some of these articles, recently the Pope and the top imam, the head imam in the world over Sunni Muslims, that's what Al-Qaeda is.
[01:31:13.496 --> 01:31:14.737]  Met with the Pope at the Vatican.
[01:31:31.072 --> 01:31:31.352]  God is great!
[01:32:02.278 --> 01:32:02.978]  Incredible threat.
[01:32:02.998 --> 01:32:07.079]  Now ISIS wants to attack the Olympics coming up in Brazil.
[01:32:07.799 --> 01:32:11.100]  Hungary's Prime Minister gets it and says Clinton is George Soros' puppet.
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:16.381]  Warns that they want to overrun the EU with millions of Muslims.
[01:32:16.922 --> 01:32:21.703]  Radical ones that are wedded to the left.
[01:32:21.723 --> 01:32:26.764]  22% of resettled refugees in Minnesota have tested positive for tuberculosis and then they go on to report
[01:32:27.404 --> 01:32:30.206]  That they're letting them in when they have tuberculosis.
[01:32:30.526 --> 01:32:33.128]  This is unprecedented attack on our country.
[01:32:33.348 --> 01:32:35.629]  This is a government at war with the people.
[01:32:35.949 --> 01:32:39.171]  This is a government savaging the population, and it goes on and on.
[01:32:39.431 --> 01:32:46.636]  The open borders are the key to globalism, destroyed national sovereignty, and radical Islamists that can't even live with each other in peace are not compatible here.
[01:32:47.096 --> 01:32:47.456]  Period.
[01:32:47.917 --> 01:32:51.519]  We shouldn't have to submit to their backwards culture of oppression.
[01:32:52.219 --> 01:33:04.305]  We are the true liberals who promote free speech across the board in Europe and the United States and Canada, and we must stand for it and not be bullied into a new dark age of oppression and tyranny.
[01:33:20.692 --> 01:33:24.836]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:25.576 --> 01:33:27.058]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.518 --> 01:33:35.966]  The Germans are waking up to globalism and the new world order.
[01:33:47.509 --> 01:33:49.651]  Marches every day across the country.
[01:33:49.711 --> 01:33:50.731]  The same thing in France.
[01:33:51.972 --> 01:33:56.155]  As the globalist project to destroy Europe and merge it with the Middle East accelerates.
[01:33:57.576 --> 01:33:59.518]  Facing total extinction.
[01:34:00.298 --> 01:34:04.982]  Will the West at least get up on its knees and attempt to fight back?
[01:34:06.247 --> 01:34:07.468]  The answer is yes.
[01:34:08.068 --> 01:34:09.348]  Going back to Dresden, Germany.
[01:34:09.509 --> 01:34:11.529]  We're there to cover Bilderberg, coming up in three days.
[01:34:11.970 --> 01:34:14.151]  We'll cover it Thursday, Friday, Saturday, right through Sunday.
[01:34:14.791 --> 01:34:16.392]  Rob Dew and Josh Owens are there.
[01:34:16.752 --> 01:34:19.833]  Our other reporters are going to be popping in tomorrow at big rallies out in California.
[01:34:19.873 --> 01:34:21.534]  Leanne McAdoo has been dispatched.
[01:34:21.614 --> 01:34:22.394]  She wanted to go.
[01:34:23.195 --> 01:34:25.135]  And she said, hey, that's a little sexist.
[01:34:25.155 --> 01:34:26.396]  I said, well, I don't want you getting beat up.
[01:34:26.716 --> 01:34:29.737]  OK, yes, I don't send a woman where she can get beat up.
[01:34:29.837 --> 01:34:30.378]  I send guys.
[01:34:31.437 --> 01:34:32.138]  And I guess it's true.
[01:34:32.198 --> 01:34:34.601]  I said, OK, Leigh-Anne, but she goes, well, how far should I go?
[01:34:34.681 --> 01:34:35.962]  And I'm like, yeah, exactly.
[01:34:37.123 --> 01:34:39.686]  I mean, I don't want Leigh-Anne to get her nose broken or something, but she went.
[01:34:40.287 --> 01:34:40.727]  She went.
[01:34:41.648 --> 01:34:42.269]  OK, well.
[01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:47.694]  I don't think Gloria Steinem is going to be pleased though, because these communists are targeting women.
[01:34:47.714 --> 01:34:49.195]  But Joe Biggs is there to protect her.
[01:34:49.676 --> 01:34:50.777]  Oh, I'm sorry, that's sexist.
[01:34:50.797 --> 01:34:51.618]  A man's going to help a woman.
[01:34:52.218 --> 01:34:53.940]  Going back to Rob Dew and Josh Owens.
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:56.442]  Rob, great videos you've been filing.
[01:34:57.263 --> 01:34:57.683]  Amazing.
[01:34:57.723 --> 01:35:02.127]  This one on the original Trump wall in Germany.
[01:35:02.147 --> 01:35:02.988]  Tell folks about that.
[01:35:03.028 --> 01:35:03.969]  Tell us what happened during the break.
[01:35:05.317 --> 01:35:09.721]  We found a medieval castle after we interviewed that migrant Mohammed down in Newmark.
[01:35:11.643 --> 01:35:13.565]  On this hill there's like these ruins of a castle.
[01:35:13.605 --> 01:35:16.488]  So we went up to check it out and we decided to shoot a report there.
[01:35:16.528 --> 01:35:18.890]  We shot some amazing footage we'll be putting up as well later.
[01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:19.891]  But Alex, take a look at this.
[01:35:20.271 --> 01:35:23.854]  Thousands of people marching for anti-immigration.
[01:35:23.894 --> 01:35:24.335]  Now watch this.
[01:35:24.355 --> 01:35:25.156]  We're going to turn around.
[01:35:25.516 --> 01:35:27.638]  I've found Bernie Sanders supporters here in Germany.
[01:35:28.018 --> 01:35:29.800]  German Bernie Sanders supporters right here.
[01:35:30.373 --> 01:35:32.493]  You can see they have the refugees welcome sign.
[01:35:32.913 --> 01:35:34.054]  They've got their little sign.
[01:35:34.274 --> 01:35:35.754]  I guess they're against nationalism.
[01:35:36.094 --> 01:35:40.015]  But you can see maybe about 40, 50 at the most.
[01:35:40.535 --> 01:35:44.836]  They're chanting and they've got the communist flag right there.
[01:35:45.236 --> 01:35:50.177]  So these are communist leftists here that are pro-illegal immigration, pro-migration.
[01:35:50.197 --> 01:35:51.177]  They want to fund this stuff.
[01:35:51.197 --> 01:35:58.238]  They want to basically sell their future down the river because they've been told... Let's show a little more attention to that blonde police officer for a moment, please.
[01:36:00.282 --> 01:36:02.644]  Yeah, it kind of reminds me of Austria last year.
[01:36:03.625 --> 01:36:05.606]  So, once again, they are wearing their jumpsuits.
[01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:07.468]  We'll get another shot over this way.
[01:36:08.188 --> 01:36:12.071]  But you can see... Now, let's show the sense of the numbers.
[01:36:12.111 --> 01:36:18.777]  You got maybe 50 leftist and brainwashed mainstream media viewers, punk rockers, anarchist communists, stuff like that.
[01:36:19.157 --> 01:36:20.618]  Not even 50, like maybe 35.
[01:36:20.838 --> 01:36:26.683]  And then across the street, it looks like a two-mile long line of thousands and thousands and thousands of people marching.
[01:36:27.574 --> 01:36:29.536]  This line has been moving for about five minutes.
[01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:34.401]  It's several, probably 20 people thick as it moves.
[01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:36.984]  And there's no sign of this line ending.
[01:36:37.404 --> 01:36:41.328]  So you can see the very small pro-immigration rally.
[01:36:41.608 --> 01:36:46.333]  And then here in Dresden, you have this large... All right, now let's go back to that female police officer.
[01:36:47.214 --> 01:36:47.815]  What was that, Alex?
[01:36:47.875 --> 01:36:48.295]  I'm serious.
[01:36:48.315 --> 01:36:49.757]  Let's go back to the female police officer.
[01:36:51.624 --> 01:36:52.885]  Sorry, I'm having a little fun, folks.
[01:36:52.965 --> 01:36:53.585]  I apologize.
[01:36:54.326 --> 01:36:55.086]  No, no.
[01:36:55.106 --> 01:36:57.988]  Feel free to ask if anybody speaks English and see if they want to talk to her, too.
[01:36:58.008 --> 01:36:59.690]  You know, see what she thinks.
[01:37:01.931 --> 01:37:03.112]  I don't think they're allowed to talk.
[01:37:03.272 --> 01:37:04.093]  I could go to... I know.
[01:37:04.153 --> 01:37:04.633]  I don't care.
[01:37:04.673 --> 01:37:05.434]  Just go talk to her.
[01:37:06.274 --> 01:37:06.614]  You know what?
[01:37:06.734 --> 01:37:09.056]  I think I'm going to go talk to one of these migrants.
[01:37:09.136 --> 01:37:10.477]  It's like you're a Mars rover.
[01:37:10.557 --> 01:37:14.440]  I can't be there, but you're going up, see, to check out the intelligent life here.
[01:37:15.541 --> 01:37:16.501]  Exactly.
[01:37:16.541 --> 01:37:17.502]  We're sending the rover in.
[01:37:20.604 --> 01:37:23.026]  Why don't you go into the... Okay, here comes one of them.
[01:37:37.011 --> 01:37:37.551]  Speak English?
[01:37:37.731 --> 01:37:37.971]  Yep.
[01:37:38.171 --> 01:37:38.552]  Alright.
[01:37:38.912 --> 01:37:41.693]  So, uh, what's the name of your group and why are you here?
[01:37:42.193 --> 01:38:03.661]  Um, uh, PEGIDA is, we're also the refugees which come to Germany and to Dresden and we are here to say no to PEGIDA because we want the refugees, we want to help the people, uh, who come here and these, uh, people just, uh... So how many refugees do you want to come here?
[01:38:03.681 --> 01:38:06.222]  A million came last year.
[01:38:07.150 --> 01:38:08.171]  I'm fine with that.
[01:38:08.431 --> 01:38:17.058]  I think German does not lose something on his image or his money or his culture because the refugees come here.
[01:38:17.098 --> 01:38:20.160]  I think the refugees are good for Germany.
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:22.382]  He wants a tax raise to pay for them?
[01:38:22.402 --> 01:38:22.922]  Is that what he said?
[01:38:23.323 --> 01:38:25.724]  What about the taxes that it's going to take to house them?
[01:38:25.744 --> 01:38:28.086]  Because right now they're housing them and giving them food.
[01:38:28.106 --> 01:38:29.287]  They're not actually working.
[01:38:29.307 --> 01:38:30.928]  They're not integrating into your society.
[01:38:32.329 --> 01:38:41.577]  Ask him if he wants Sharia law.
[01:38:41.637 --> 01:38:45.380]  I mean, if we should let them mutilate their women and make them wear hoods over their heads.
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:47.582]  Ask them if it's okay how they treat their women.
[01:38:49.161 --> 01:38:51.542]  What about in Muslim countries, the way they treat their women?
[01:38:51.562 --> 01:38:53.162]  Do you think that's okay to do that here?
[01:38:53.342 --> 01:38:53.522]  What?
[01:38:53.923 --> 01:38:54.923]  The way they treat their women.
[01:38:54.963 --> 01:38:55.663]  Make them cover up.
[01:38:55.703 --> 01:38:56.383]  They can beat them.
[01:38:56.423 --> 01:38:57.604]  They can stone them.
[01:38:58.064 --> 01:39:03.546]  I think this is a kind of education which we have to bring them nearer.
[01:39:03.706 --> 01:39:04.266]  That's right.
[01:39:04.346 --> 01:39:06.046]  They have to be educated.
[01:39:06.246 --> 01:39:07.747]  They don't assimilate anywhere.
[01:39:07.767 --> 01:39:07.987]  Explain.
[01:39:08.007 --> 01:39:09.708]  They're the most unassimilatable people.
[01:39:10.808 --> 01:39:11.008]  Yes.
[01:39:12.373 --> 01:39:16.136]  It does change their religion, but it's, um... No, you're good.
[01:39:16.236 --> 01:39:20.199]  I think... Explain to this ding-dong that you cannot assimilate these people.
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:25.563]  Changing what they... Tell them, her dress like that would be illegal under these people.
[01:39:25.923 --> 01:39:27.425]  That woman would have to wear a hood over her head.
[01:39:27.445 --> 01:39:33.149]  They really want to stay here, and that's their only way to survive, or one of the ways to survive.
[01:39:33.789 --> 01:39:37.192]  Where's the money gonna come from, though, to pay for all this?
[01:39:37.212 --> 01:39:38.293]  Germany is rich.
[01:39:38.333 --> 01:39:39.254]  Germany has money.
[01:39:41.696 --> 01:39:44.877]  No, you've got a deficit.
[01:39:44.957 --> 01:39:46.238]  That's the problem with socialism.
[01:39:46.258 --> 01:39:47.839]  You eventually run out of other people's money.
[01:39:48.059 --> 01:39:50.440]  Ask this guy what he does.
[01:39:55.686 --> 01:39:56.686]  Germany is rich.
[01:39:57.247 --> 01:39:58.367]  In fact, what do you do?
[01:39:58.427 --> 01:39:59.007]  What's your job?
[01:39:59.408 --> 01:40:00.288]  I'm a student.
[01:40:00.408 --> 01:40:00.928]  You're a student?
[01:40:01.068 --> 01:40:01.749]  Yes.
[01:40:01.769 --> 01:40:02.949]  You never worked, same.
[01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:05.170]  Really much, yes.
[01:40:05.770 --> 01:40:07.831]  But I saw the future.
[01:40:07.871 --> 01:40:12.593]  That were the people who want to live in this Germany with the wages.
[01:40:12.993 --> 01:40:15.555]  This guy will be given a job later over people that work.
[01:40:15.755 --> 01:40:17.135]  This is a dumb parasite.
[01:40:17.215 --> 01:40:18.496]  So stupid he doesn't know he's one.
[01:40:19.264 --> 01:40:22.025]  Bring up the blonde police officer and she'd have to wear a beekeeper suit.
[01:40:22.245 --> 01:40:25.586]  Say, do you understand the Muslims take over, this woman couldn't even be a police officer.
[01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:26.306]  Ask the idiot.
[01:40:28.607 --> 01:40:29.407]  Ask the police officer?
[01:40:30.307 --> 01:40:30.987]  No, ask him.
[01:40:32.088 --> 01:40:34.689]  Ask him if he realizes she'd have to wear a hood over her head.
[01:40:35.589 --> 01:40:40.650]  Do you realize if Sharia law happened here, if you brought in enough refugees, that they would be the majority?
[01:40:41.111 --> 01:40:43.791]  Women like this and over here would have to wear hoods over their heads.
[01:40:46.630 --> 01:40:49.131]  Because they're changing the laws whenever they become a majority.
[01:40:49.171 --> 01:40:50.732]  They're doing this in Michigan.
[01:40:50.752 --> 01:40:53.453]  They're trying to institute Sharia law in some of the states in the United States.
[01:40:55.274 --> 01:40:56.695]  I don't understand the question.
[01:40:57.696 --> 01:40:59.316]  Hey, interview that blonde reporter right behind you.
[01:40:59.336 --> 01:41:00.217]  She's walking around beside you.
[01:41:00.237 --> 01:41:00.997]  Josh knows who she is.
[01:41:01.237 --> 01:41:02.298]  To your left, Josh.
[01:41:02.578 --> 01:41:03.579]  That's Lauren Southern.
[01:41:03.619 --> 01:41:05.239]  Hey Lauren, we're live on the air.
[01:41:05.259 --> 01:41:06.140]  Okay, well she's from Canada.
[01:41:06.940 --> 01:41:07.521]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:07.541 --> 01:41:08.822]  So what have you found today?
[01:41:08.842 --> 01:41:10.583]  What have you been in your investigations?
[01:41:10.783 --> 01:41:12.845]  In my investigations, I mean, I've talked to a few people.
[01:41:12.885 --> 01:41:16.748]  They just seem like Germans concerned about the Islamification of their country.
[01:41:16.909 --> 01:41:20.312]  And I mean, I've heard a lot online that they're racists, that they're Nazis.
[01:41:20.332 --> 01:41:22.874]  But I interviewed a few people that have the giant
[01:41:23.594 --> 01:41:28.436]  I talked to one guy, he's a student, and I think most of the people here are students, basically from the Bernie Sanders class.
[01:41:28.456 --> 01:41:34.279]  It looks like, give us free, give us as much free as you can, is what they seem to be saying, because they think they can take more migrants.
[01:41:54.107 --> 01:42:00.389]  I've talked to a few students as well and one of the students said, I just can't believe how racist this is.
[01:42:00.409 --> 01:42:04.791]  A lot of people don't seem to understand that Islam is a religion and not a race, right?
[01:42:05.031 --> 01:42:07.692]  Or that it treats women like animals.
[01:42:10.618 --> 01:42:12.559]  We can't judge people when we don't know about them.
[01:42:12.679 --> 01:42:15.641]  And he said, I've never read the Koran, so I can't judge them, right?
[01:42:15.721 --> 01:42:17.242]  I'm like, well, maybe you should talk to the country.
[01:42:17.262 --> 01:42:23.366]  Maybe you should understand yourself, because maybe there's a reason people are gathered in large numbers here at the rally.
[01:42:23.426 --> 01:42:26.308]  Maybe there's a reason people are against the Islamification of their country.
[01:42:26.368 --> 01:42:26.708]  Exactly.
[01:42:26.748 --> 01:42:28.669]  Where we're at now is in Dresden, Germany.
[01:42:28.749 --> 01:42:35.233]  We are at one of the town squares here, where they had a giant, what do you estimate, about 3,000, 4,000 people?
[01:42:35.313 --> 01:42:36.114]  Oh, yeah.
[01:42:36.154 --> 01:42:38.155]  And the crowd kept growing the entire time I was there.
[01:42:38.175 --> 01:42:39.035]  The march, it got huge.
[01:42:39.055 --> 01:42:39.195]  Yeah.
[01:42:40.706 --> 01:42:43.247]  So, I think we're gonna go, uh, do you know where they're marching to?
[01:42:44.287 --> 01:42:44.627]  That way?
[01:42:44.727 --> 01:42:46.548]  Alright, I think we're gonna go try to keep up with them.
[01:42:46.568 --> 01:42:47.568]  This looks like it's dying down.
[01:42:47.588 --> 01:42:48.688]  They're pulling up their banner.
[01:42:49.249 --> 01:42:52.349]  Um, I think they have to go somewhere else and, uh, and beg for free food or something.
[01:42:52.890 --> 01:42:54.670]  So, uh, we're gonna leave the socialists alone.
[01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:57.111]  Gosh, they're so stupid, and they think they're so intellectual.
[01:42:57.431 --> 01:42:59.071]  Alright, well, it's good to see Laura Southern there.
[01:42:59.091 --> 01:43:00.192]  We just had her on last week.
[01:43:00.432 --> 01:43:04.533]  She was censored by Facebook, uh, for daring to, uh, you know, engage in free speech.
[01:43:05.505 --> 01:43:18.835]  For just saying something might get censored, yeah, they took her page away, but then after people got angry, and I guess enough people, you know, by putting it out on the internet, and I think we talked about it, we put it out on InfoWars, they restored her page after that.
[01:43:18.915 --> 01:43:21.337]  Yeah, no, we broke it and then Drudge picked it up.
[01:43:21.557 --> 01:43:26.721]  But see, if we didn't have things like Drudge or InfoWars protecting the other reporters, we wouldn't get squat.
[01:43:26.941 --> 01:43:31.124]  And I'm not asking for love back from all these reporters and groups, but I'm constantly defending
[01:43:32.445 --> 01:43:39.567]  Other reporters at Daily Caller or Breitbart, and it's nice to see them defending us some as well, because we're all in this together.
[01:43:39.587 --> 01:43:50.049]  In fact, we have a Tucker Carlson that owns Daily Caller popping in for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour about how he's been censored and manipulated and how they misrepresent interviews that he gives.
[01:43:50.689 --> 01:43:57.451]  So there's a lot of examples of that and the dirty tricks that they're engaged in, a la the activity of Katie Couric.
[01:43:58.311 --> 01:44:02.454]  In fact, guys, I think I have it here, but will you guys pull that, because that was a controversy a couple weeks ago.
[01:44:02.474 --> 01:44:06.616]  I want to refresh myself with the way Carlson was getting manipulated.
[01:44:06.636 --> 01:44:09.418]  Tucker Carlson says Glenn Beck sucked up to Zuck.
[01:44:09.478 --> 01:44:10.739]  You're such an impressive guy.
[01:44:10.779 --> 01:44:18.163]  He was in the meeting with Facebook Head, which I'm fine with, as long as you don't roll over and worship what happened there.
[01:44:18.523 --> 01:44:25.828]  It's good to have somebody that was there, but they were sworn to secrecy in those meetings, so he will not say the name of Glenn Beck.
[01:44:26.789 --> 01:44:31.852]  But he's been censored, he's been manipulated on Facebook and other places as well, so he's going to be popping in with us.
[01:44:32.252 --> 01:44:32.793]  Rob Dew.
[01:44:33.753 --> 01:44:34.534]  Yes.
[01:44:34.554 --> 01:44:36.435]  You're doing such a terrific job.
[01:44:36.535 --> 01:44:43.999]  How about we just for two or three minutes here, and I'm going to let you go, hand the mic and switch the camera to yourself so I can talk to Josh Owens.
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:45.120]  Okay.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:46.961]  Give us one second, we can do that.
[01:44:47.662 --> 01:44:48.202]  Fantastic.
[01:44:48.522 --> 01:44:49.983]  And then I do have to get to a bunch of clips, folks.
[01:44:50.023 --> 01:44:51.724]  There are so many of these I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:44:52.384 --> 01:44:54.706]  Hillary Clinton government has a right to regulate the Second Amendment.
[01:44:56.192 --> 01:45:00.137]  You don't have a right to regulate private citizens that don't have criminal records.
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.962]  That's why it says free men will not be debarred the use of guns.
[01:45:04.982 --> 01:45:05.603]  That's what that means.
[01:45:07.886 --> 01:45:08.867]  That's a founding father quote.
[01:45:08.887 --> 01:45:09.948]  It's also in the Federalist Papers.
[01:45:11.264 --> 01:45:15.628]  But yes, certainly private institutions do, to a certain extent, as long as they're not open commons.
[01:45:16.369 --> 01:45:21.373]  But your goal is to ban the guns, and you've banned them everywhere else you've got in control, like New York, Chicago, D.C.
[01:45:22.074 --> 01:45:24.416]  So stop saying you don't want a total ban.
[01:45:24.896 --> 01:45:25.517]  So that's coming up.
[01:45:25.537 --> 01:45:26.498]  We've got a bunch of other clips.
[01:45:26.838 --> 01:45:30.841]  But Josh Owens always busting his butt, and he's gone jihadi there.
[01:45:30.882 --> 01:45:34.845]  He's got the beard so that he can infiltrate the camps.
[01:45:35.045 --> 01:45:36.426]  We're joking, we're joking.
[01:45:38.468 --> 01:45:41.289]  I could ask you questions, but you've been in Germany 24 hours, already kicked butt.
[01:45:41.789 --> 01:45:42.730]  What do you want to impart?
[01:45:42.770 --> 01:45:48.352]  What have you picked up in day one of this 10-day Operation InfoWars?
[01:45:49.272 --> 01:45:56.455]  Well look, Alex, one thing that I don't think was conveyed in the video that we posted yesterday, when we went to this migrant camp, all we wanted to do was simply speak to people.
[01:45:56.735 --> 01:45:59.356]  We wanted to show what the situation was there, because
[01:46:00.299 --> 01:46:10.871]  That is our future if we continue to leave the borders open and allow anyone and everyone to come in under the guise of being peaceful and being, you know, nice people and, well, we just want to help them.
[01:46:11.052 --> 01:46:11.752]  That's not what it is.
[01:46:12.714 --> 01:46:13.755]  That's not what it is, first off.
[01:46:14.195 --> 01:46:16.398]  Second off, my point in saying that is that
[01:46:17.265 --> 01:46:21.529]  In the video, they bum-rushed us because we were trying to speak to people.
[01:46:21.549 --> 01:46:26.374]  I guess they were afraid that they might say something that would shine a negative light on them.
[01:46:26.794 --> 01:46:31.999]  So, this group of thugs in blue suits, I mean, I guess they were self-appointed security.
[01:46:32.671 --> 01:46:38.133]  Ran up to us, and Rob Dew had the microphone, and I should have thought to unplug the microphone so I could get the audio on my end.
[01:46:38.633 --> 01:46:41.774]  The guy was screaming at me, telling me to put the camera down, put the camera down.
[01:46:42.014 --> 01:46:43.654]  They would erase the footage.
[01:46:43.714 --> 01:46:45.135]  We will erase the footage.
[01:46:45.535 --> 01:46:56.378]  And by the way, you're on the edge of it at the public interest to it, and these guys look like they're from Nigeria or Central Africa, just to show they used the last wave to be the enforcers to cover for the next wave.
[01:46:56.738 --> 01:46:58.461]  I've had members of parliament on from the UK.
[01:46:58.681 --> 01:46:59.903]  This is a tactic they've used there.
[01:46:59.943 --> 01:47:05.131]  The government is bringing in foreigners because they're totally beholden to the government and have no culture in the country.
[01:47:05.331 --> 01:47:06.593]  They feel like outsiders.
[01:47:06.894 --> 01:47:08.096]  The government's outsider.
[01:47:08.136 --> 01:47:08.757]  It's globalist.
[01:47:08.957 --> 01:47:10.139]  So they work together in tandem.
[01:47:11.198 --> 01:47:12.118]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:47:12.138 --> 01:47:16.300]  And I was having a back and forth with the guy, you can see it at the end of the video if you watch the video, it's kind of long.
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:27.924]  But the guy that worked for the city and was coming to clear things up, he was saying that, well, we don't want them to feel threatened, there's a lot of people out here that want to get them, and we just need to make sure they're safe.
[01:47:28.164 --> 01:47:28.904]  And I made the point
[01:47:29.568 --> 01:47:31.530]  Oh, so it's okay if we don't feel safe.
[01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:32.791]  It's okay if they attack us.
[01:47:33.051 --> 01:47:36.094]  But we just have to make sure that they have their fuzzy little blankets and they're nice.
[01:47:36.154 --> 01:47:38.315]  It's okay if Glenn Beck brings them teddy bears.
[01:47:38.375 --> 01:47:43.019]  It's okay if they're raping and killing and robbing and stabbing and the highway systems are shutting down.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:43.760]  It's okay.
[01:47:44.521 --> 01:47:48.584]  Yeah, it's okay if regular citizens have to bust their butt to live, to feed their families.
[01:47:48.644 --> 01:47:51.226]  It's okay if 85% of Germans in national polls don't want it.
[01:47:51.426 --> 01:47:51.967]  They don't get it.
[01:47:53.123 --> 01:47:54.203]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[01:47:54.504 --> 01:48:15.192]  They get food for free, they don't have to work, they get a place to stay, and the interview that we did today with a guy, which will be coming out soon, as soon as we get back to the car, he was saying how much he hated Germany, yet he doesn't have to work, he doesn't have to worry about money, and then at the end of it he was like, well, I kind of like it because I don't actually have to do anything, and then Dew asked him, he said, well, you're from Syria, so are you going to go back to Syria when you're done?
[01:48:15.212 --> 01:48:22.495]  And he was like, haha, no, I'm not going to go back to Syria, I'm going to stay here because I have more opportunities here, because I can get things that I want here, not back in Syria.
[01:48:23.095 --> 01:48:26.698]  Arrogant Muslim invader says he hates Germany but is going to stay and loves the free stuff.
[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:30.081]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:48:30.101 --> 01:48:31.483]  And that's the thing that people don't get.
[01:48:31.503 --> 01:48:36.867]  These social justice warriors, whether it's in Europe, whether it's in the US, they don't understand that this is not some game.
[01:48:37.047 --> 01:48:38.469]  This is not some let's be nice to people.
[01:48:38.509 --> 01:48:39.550]  Nobody wants to be mean to people.
[01:48:39.570 --> 01:48:40.891]  That's not the freaking point.
[01:48:41.131 --> 01:48:42.252]  That's not what's going on here.
[01:48:42.532 --> 01:48:43.994]  These people aren't all evil.
[01:48:45.475 --> 01:48:50.378]  They're not all evil, but there is a system behind this that is making sure that they come over.
[01:48:50.458 --> 01:48:51.139]  Absolutely.
[01:48:51.159 --> 01:49:06.429]  It's Peter Sutherland, the guy that founded the EU on record 20-something years ago, off their so-called trade deals, who is now the head of this migrant commission to open Europe up, advertise, bring them in, and then have them be a new political weapon system.
[01:49:06.889 --> 01:49:07.849]  Get a cab if you have to.
[01:49:07.909 --> 01:49:08.870]  Catch up to that rally.
[01:49:08.890 --> 01:49:09.790]  This might get crazy.
[01:49:09.810 --> 01:49:11.551]  I know they're about to march through some of the immigrant areas.
[01:49:11.831 --> 01:49:13.811]  Great job, Josh Owens, Rob Due.
[01:49:14.131 --> 01:49:15.072]  I really appreciate your work.
[01:49:15.112 --> 01:49:15.792]  Our prayers are with you.
[01:49:16.812 --> 01:49:17.253]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:49:17.273 --> 01:49:18.033]  Stay tuned, everybody.
[01:49:18.053 --> 01:49:19.313]  We're going to be covering this for the next week.
[01:49:19.633 --> 01:49:20.113]  Absolutely.
[01:49:20.153 --> 01:49:22.194]  And call us if something hot happens.
[01:49:22.614 --> 01:49:23.134]  Just listen.
[01:49:23.355 --> 01:49:24.835]  Get a cab.
[01:49:24.855 --> 01:49:26.015]  Have you guys lost the march?
[01:49:26.075 --> 01:49:26.436]  I'm sorry.
[01:49:27.016 --> 01:49:27.596]  Get in there, my friend.
[01:49:29.403 --> 01:49:29.683]  I'm good.
[01:49:30.343 --> 01:49:30.724]  All right.
[01:49:30.744 --> 01:49:39.107]  Well, I tell you, there's no other media like this, folks, because Fox News, CNN, all of them, they want to have producers there controlling everything and showing you what they want you to see.
[01:49:39.567 --> 01:49:42.468]  We're just teleprompter free, live cameras worldwide.
[01:49:42.748 --> 01:49:46.989]  We have built an organization thanks to your support that is unprecedented.
[01:49:47.370 --> 01:49:49.790]  And I want to round it out with another 10 personnel.
[01:49:50.691 --> 01:49:52.451]  So see it as a donation.
[01:49:52.812 --> 01:49:53.912]  You need these nutraceuticals.

[01:50:27.073 --> 01:50:35.002]  Our footage is all over mainstream media because what happens is they won't report on it, but once we force it, and Drudge forces it, then it all comes out.
[01:50:35.462 --> 01:50:39.787]  Then it ends up being pushed out on the news, and we are changing the narrative towards reality.
[01:50:40.248 --> 01:50:41.129]  Thanks to your support.
[01:50:41.449 --> 01:50:42.790]  So, get a Hillary for President shirt.

[01:51:10.277 --> 01:51:15.882]  Bilderberg 2016 is kicking off Thursday, June 9th, and InfoWars is already there to cover the event.
[01:51:16.122 --> 01:51:28.511]  This year, the Bilderberg global elite are meeting in Dresden, Germany, where they'll likely discuss how to stop the UK from leaving the EU, the growing resistance against the destruction of Western culture and the mass invasion of Muslim migrants, and the rise of Donald Trump.
[01:51:28.672 --> 01:51:34.096]  The mood at Bilderberg will be very grim, as both populism and nationalism rise up across the world to stop globalism.
[01:51:34.336 --> 01:51:39.160]  Europeans in particular are tired of having their lives controlled by the unelected bureaucracy known as the European Union.
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:43.742]  Which was based on Adolf Hitler's plan for a European super-state which eradicates national sovereignty.
[01:51:44.002 --> 01:51:49.505]  Bilderberg Group has been nurturing the EU to life since the 1950s, and now they see their despotic regime dying.
[01:51:49.745 --> 01:51:51.726]  Maybe it'll be a wake-up call for some of the elite.
[01:51:51.846 --> 01:51:54.507]  There's more to existence than simply controlling others.
[01:51:54.727 --> 01:52:00.170]  And humanity could explore the universe if individuals were left alone to brew innovations which advance the human race.
[01:52:00.410 --> 01:52:08.418]  Keep checking InfoWars.com and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube for the latest breaking developments on Bilderberg and the migrant crisis in Germany.
[01:52:08.538 --> 01:52:09.759]  This is Kent Daniels reporting.
[01:52:10.179 --> 01:52:11.180]  Brain Force is here.
[01:52:11.701 --> 01:52:14.003]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:52:14.263 --> 01:52:22.070]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[01:52:22.850 --> 01:52:26.433]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[01:52:26.453 --> 01:52:28.795]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:52:29.155 --> 01:52:32.678]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:52:32.718 --> 01:52:35.861]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:52:36.361 --> 01:52:41.145]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:52:41.685 --> 01:52:43.527]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[01:52:43.887 --> 01:52:48.311]  That is activated by the different compounds in the yerba mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:52:48.471 --> 01:52:50.472]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:52:51.093 --> 01:52:52.554]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:52:52.694 --> 01:52:52.954]  Exactly.
[01:52:52.974 --> 01:52:56.777]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:52:57.277 --> 01:53:05.242]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:15.625]  Bilderberg 2016 is kicking off Thursday, June 9th, and InfoWars is already there to cover the event.
[01:53:15.865 --> 01:53:28.235]  This year, the Bilderberg Global Elite are meeting in Dresden, Germany, where they'll likely discuss how to stop the UK from leaving the EU, the growing resistance against the destruction of Western culture and the mass invasion of Muslim migrants, and the rise of Donald Trump.
[01:53:28.435 --> 01:53:33.860]  The mood at Bilderberg will be very grim as both populism and nationalism rise up across the world to stop globalism.
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:38.924]  Europeans in particular are tired of having their lives controlled by the unelected bureaucracy known as the European Union.
[01:53:39.144 --> 01:53:43.505]  Which was based on Adolf Hitler's plan for a European super-state which eradicates national sovereignty.
[01:53:43.746 --> 01:53:49.267]  Bilderberg Group has been nurturing the EU to life since the 1950s, and now they see their despotic regime dying.
[01:53:49.507 --> 01:53:51.468]  Maybe it'll be a wake-up call for some of the elite.
[01:53:51.608 --> 01:53:54.269]  There's more to existence than simply controlling others.
[01:53:54.489 --> 01:53:59.931]  And humanity could explore the universe if individuals were left alone to brew innovations which advance the human race.
[01:54:00.151 --> 01:54:08.173]  Keep checking InfoWars.com and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube for the latest breaking developments on Bilderberg and the migrant crisis in Germany.
[01:54:08.273 --> 01:54:09.494]  This is Kent Daniels reporting.
[01:54:28.447 --> 01:54:52.520]  Now there's so many of these great videos that Rob New and Josh Jones have already put out that I'm gonna play some of them later in the next hour but we have a lot of stuff to cover here obviously.
[01:54:53.752 --> 01:54:59.774]  Tucker Carlson's coming up about the whole Facebook meeting and I'm going to ferret more out of him and all the censorship that's going on.
[01:54:59.854 --> 01:55:04.595]  But we have migrant camp freaks out on reporters asking questions in Germany.
[01:55:04.675 --> 01:55:06.796]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[01:55:06.916 --> 01:55:08.876]  Medieval Trump wall found in Germany.
[01:55:08.896 --> 01:55:11.597]  Now they built walls back then to stop the Muslims.
[01:55:11.917 --> 01:55:12.918]  Because see, they invade.
[01:55:12.938 --> 01:55:13.598]  That's what they do.
[01:55:15.418 --> 01:55:21.080]  There are a lot of Muslims that are nice people, but it's definitely a religion of conquest big time.
[01:55:22.449 --> 01:55:23.329]  But they teach in school.
[01:55:23.409 --> 01:55:24.630]  The Crusades were offensive.
[01:55:24.690 --> 01:55:25.170]  No, they weren't.
[01:55:26.590 --> 01:55:28.370]  Were there atrocities in the Crusades?
[01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:29.431]  Absolutely.
[01:55:29.451 --> 01:55:30.731]  You think I'm defending medieval Europe?
[01:55:33.792 --> 01:55:34.832]  That's a funny one, too.
[01:55:35.192 --> 01:55:38.753]  It's like, I don't like the Aztec culture.
[01:55:38.773 --> 01:55:41.253]  It doesn't mean I don't like people that are from Aztec bloodlines.
[01:55:41.433 --> 01:55:45.794]  It's, again, believe me, if you were a Mesoamerican, you didn't like the Aztecs either.
[01:55:46.155 --> 01:55:49.035]  They're the ones that depopulated most of southern North America.
[01:55:49.975 --> 01:55:51.996]  They went around killing almost everybody.
[01:55:54.346 --> 01:55:55.086]  And eating them.
[01:55:55.106 --> 01:55:59.467]  Until they ran out of people.
[01:55:59.827 --> 01:56:05.968]  And by the time Cortez showed up, a couple hundred men took out thousands, because they were just completely out of their minds.
[01:56:05.988 --> 01:56:08.448]  But I am digressing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:08.509 --> 01:56:09.789]  They were following a bizarre cult.
[01:56:10.349 --> 01:56:13.489]  And taking hallucinogens every couple days, over time, makes you a little bit crazy.
[01:56:13.709 --> 01:56:17.690]  When your central planners are taking hallucinogens a couple times a week, not a very good idea.
[01:56:18.630 --> 01:56:19.830]  Now once a month, maybe it's okay.
[01:56:19.891 --> 01:56:20.771]  Okay, I'm being sarcastic.
[01:56:21.551 --> 01:56:22.311]  But continuing,
[01:56:23.871 --> 01:56:25.175]  I want to play this clip since I mentioned it.
[01:56:25.917 --> 01:56:27.942]  Just remind us where Hillary Clinton's at right now.
[01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:32.591]  FBI agents that have been in there, other Secret Service agents.
[01:56:32.931 --> 01:56:36.673]  Dan Bongino would not tell me what went on in the White House.
[01:56:36.693 --> 01:56:38.674]  In fact, it's time to get him back on.
[01:56:39.315 --> 01:56:40.796]  And he said, look, I'm getting threats.
[01:56:40.896 --> 01:56:42.757]  My house is getting broken into and stuff like that.
[01:56:42.777 --> 01:56:46.739]  And he's also called up and said, will you stop saying that I gave you info?
[01:56:46.799 --> 01:56:47.540]  And I said, I haven't.
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:48.100]  He went and saw the clip.
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:48.601]  He goes, oh, you didn't.
[01:56:48.621 --> 01:56:50.342]  I go, no, they're lying, saying you gave me info.
[01:56:51.002 --> 01:56:51.762]  You did not give me info.
[01:56:51.782 --> 01:56:55.245]  You said it's worse than people are saying on air.
[01:56:56.545 --> 01:56:57.206]  I have talked.
[01:56:59.039 --> 01:57:11.341]  To another Secret Service agent, and I'm just going to leave it at that, and it was done in an in-person way, and all I was told was, you are dead on, except it's worse than you think.
[01:57:11.361 --> 01:57:13.422]  That was before Bongino told me that.
[01:57:13.462 --> 01:57:13.882]  I said, what?
[01:57:13.902 --> 01:57:15.842]  And they just said, unbelievable.
[01:57:16.542 --> 01:57:17.342]  And I said, what do you mean?
[01:57:17.402 --> 01:57:20.123]  And so it's just unbelievable.
[01:57:21.323 --> 01:57:24.924]  But this begs the question, at what point is it too big to fail?
[01:57:27.395 --> 01:57:32.777]  Okay, you're sworn to secrecy, you'll get in trouble, you'll get fired, they're arresting reporters, they're arresting whistleblowers, I get it.
[01:57:33.137 --> 01:57:40.899]  But if it's unbelievable and it's illegal, you're part of a secret service that's going to cover it up?
[01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:44.100]  Sure, watch the President's back, don't tell him he's cheating on his wife.
[01:57:44.801 --> 01:57:45.901]  I get secrecy like that.
[01:57:47.982 --> 01:57:48.622]  But other stuff?
[01:57:51.547 --> 01:57:54.908]  And that's why you've got them going after the Secret Service right now with all these faux scandals.
[01:57:55.388 --> 01:57:57.749]  Oh my gosh, some of them might have had a hooker or something.
[01:57:58.069 --> 01:57:59.670]  Okay, that's not good, because of blackmail.
[01:57:59.930 --> 01:58:03.031]  But, is that selling out secrets to the Communist Chinese?
[01:58:03.091 --> 01:58:03.691]  Missile secrets?
[01:58:03.991 --> 01:58:07.092]  Is that selling us out to Al-Qaeda and ISIS and Saudi Arabians?
[01:58:07.152 --> 01:58:10.073]  Is that having Saudi Arabian princes in the White House at midnight?
[01:58:12.534 --> 01:58:13.914]  Doing heaven knows what?
[01:58:14.734 --> 01:58:16.975]  Or Hillary throwing fits, running around screaming at everyone?
[01:58:18.653 --> 01:58:24.620]  And we already know, from the FBI agents and others that have gone public, Hillary Clinton literally chews the carpet.
[01:58:25.241 --> 01:58:26.202]  I'm sorry, I didn't get to this yet.
[01:58:26.222 --> 01:58:28.345]  I want to come back before Tucker Carlson joins us.
[01:58:28.365 --> 01:58:28.925]  I want to play this.
[01:58:30.027 --> 01:58:33.350]  Hillary Clinton government has a right to regulate Second Amendment.
[01:58:34.261 --> 01:58:37.804]  That's a big statement from her in the campaign, because that's what she intends to do.
[01:58:37.844 --> 01:58:40.946]  And you can regulate something until it's basically illegal.
[01:58:41.486 --> 01:58:42.387]  And that's what they plan to do.
[01:58:42.407 --> 01:58:46.670]  Listen, I know you all know that, but they're coming for the guns.
[01:58:46.710 --> 01:58:47.991]  They want to break our will.
[01:58:48.391 --> 01:58:51.193]  They've already taken everything else, and they want to get the Bible and the guns.
[01:58:51.594 --> 01:58:52.134]  They hate us.
[01:58:52.734 --> 01:58:53.615]  They hate Christians.
[01:58:54.095 --> 01:58:58.138]  No matter what color you are, you're the target and your churches have been taken over.
[01:58:58.158 --> 01:58:58.819]  They won't warn you.
[01:58:59.847 --> 01:59:01.689]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:59:01.749 --> 01:59:03.611]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:59:03.771 --> 01:59:06.574]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:59:06.674 --> 01:59:12.540]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:20.108]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[01:59:20.228 --> 01:59:21.629]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:59:21.909 --> 01:59:29.091]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:59:29.431 --> 01:59:32.832]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:59:33.052 --> 01:59:39.595]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:59:39.675 --> 01:59:41.715]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:59:43.556 --> 01:59:50.338]  It's normally $220 plus, but right now for a limited time it's less than $200 at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:50.438 --> 01:59:52.999]  And the small profit we make goes to fund our reporters.
[01:59:53.019 --> 01:59:54.499]  This is a 360 win.
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:58.821]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:00:02.602 --> 02:00:05.203]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.296 --> 02:00:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen we are back live coming in dry because I want to play this report from Germany with Rob Doom.
[02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:18.940]  This is powerful.
[02:00:20.901 --> 02:00:27.385]  Rob Doom reporting for InfoWars.com and as you can see behind me we're in the ruins of Castle Wolfstein.
[02:00:27.425 --> 02:00:34.090]  This is a medieval castle built on a large hill overlooking the town of Newmark and I'll give you a shot of that in one second.
[02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:36.151]  But we were here today because we got a tip
[02:00:36.611 --> 02:00:57.988]  from I guess an info warrior sent me an email saying there's a refugee center and they gave me the address we actually drove in there we had our body cameras rolling this time because as you know yesterday when we were in Munich and we approached the refugee center a whole crew of blue shirt people a blue shirt clad people came out got in our face were putting their hands in front of our cameras and just very angry that we were there
[02:00:58.428 --> 02:01:01.889]  Just wanting to see what was going on and how many people, migrants, were at that center.
[02:01:02.169 --> 02:01:06.711]  This is a much smaller house and we have a full interview with actually one of the Syrian migrants.
[02:01:07.211 --> 02:01:10.292]  He came over and talked to us and we interviewed him for about 20 minutes.
[02:01:10.592 --> 02:01:16.014]  He spoke okay English, okay German, and we had a pretty interesting conversation.
[02:01:16.054 --> 02:01:18.535]  So I think people are going to be really interested in listening to that.
[02:01:18.875 --> 02:01:21.916]  But here around me you can see it's got really thick walls.
[02:01:22.456 --> 02:01:26.918]  There's a big tower here which it looks like it was recently rebuilt and on top they have some
[02:01:27.478 --> 02:01:47.613]  Antennas and I guess you know cellular functions and stuff like that this is a very high point in the area you can see Josh let's get a shot of this you can see you have a view of the entire surrounding area so if you were to have invaders coming or anything you could see what was going on and there over there is the town of Newmarket
[02:01:48.809 --> 02:01:50.710]  There's about 40,000 people living there.
[02:01:51.410 --> 02:02:00.753]  And when we talked to the refugee, his name was Mohammed, he said there's about a thousand migrants in this city and they don't feel welcome in the city.
[02:02:00.793 --> 02:02:05.055]  He said for various reasons people look at them and he didn't seem to understand why.
[02:02:05.115 --> 02:02:08.856]  I tried to talk to him about that and asked him a lot of different questions.
[02:02:08.876 --> 02:02:10.156]  So it's going to be an interesting interview.
[02:02:10.176 --> 02:02:10.776]  We're going to have that.
[02:02:11.057 --> 02:02:13.717]  We're actually on our way to Dresden, Germany today.
[02:02:14.118 --> 02:02:15.158]  We started off in Munich.
[02:02:15.658 --> 02:02:16.759]  We're on our way to Dresden, Germany.
[02:02:16.779 --> 02:02:19.462]  Tonight at about 6.30 in the evening there's going to be a large protest, an anti-immigration
[02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:39.321]  We're good to go.
[02:02:55.101 --> 02:02:56.482]  And we'll also be shooting video.
[02:02:56.802 --> 02:03:12.570]  Most of the speeches will be in German, so I don't know if we'll be having those, but we will be there to see what's going on in Dresden, Germany, and then we'll be there for the remainder of the week to cover Bilderberg, but also traveling to Berlin and Leipzig to see what's going on with the migrant crisis going on in Germany there.
[02:03:12.970 --> 02:03:23.739]  I'll tell you one thing is for certain the Germans definitely are more organized than say the French or even the UK where in their way that they're housing the migrants.
[02:03:23.759 --> 02:03:33.968]  They're doing a very orderly job and it's not apparent really unless you're taking a real close look that you can actually tell there's a center or a migrant center anywhere around here or a camp.
[02:03:34.448 --> 02:03:37.311]  So they're definitely keep it more organized but
[02:03:37.711 --> 02:03:38.712]  You can tell they're stressed.
[02:03:38.752 --> 02:03:41.154]  The people here that we've talked to are very stressed.
[02:03:41.615 --> 02:03:44.578]  And they feel that most of these migrants should go back.
[02:03:44.618 --> 02:03:47.541]  They took a million in last year, 250,000 this year already.
[02:03:48.261 --> 02:03:50.383]  And you can feel that they're at the breaking point.
[02:03:50.764 --> 02:03:54.167]  And there are several countries in from the Eastern European countries.
[02:03:54.207 --> 02:03:56.489]  You've got the Czech Republic down below us.
[02:03:56.649 --> 02:03:59.112]  Austria is getting flooded, especially in Vienna.
[02:04:00.117 --> 02:04:01.078]  And then you have Hungary.
[02:04:03.579 --> 02:04:03.879]  What is it?
[02:04:03.919 --> 02:04:05.160]  Macedonia is down there.
[02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:07.041]  The former Yugoslav.
[02:04:07.061 --> 02:04:08.902]  You have Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia.
[02:04:09.222 --> 02:04:12.924]  So all these areas are getting overrun and they're making their way into Europe.
[02:04:13.365 --> 02:04:15.606]  So we'll be filing more reports on the road.
[02:04:15.666 --> 02:04:22.330]  But here's a pretty interesting look at Castle Wolfenstein here in just outside of Newmarket, Germany.
[02:04:22.630 --> 02:04:23.991]  And we're in Bavaria right now.
[02:04:24.031 --> 02:04:25.051]  Very beautiful area.
[02:04:25.952 --> 02:04:27.013]  And you can see all these
[02:04:27.973 --> 02:04:57.516]  Interesting mounds out in the distance that you know they have these plateaued mounds on top so who knows what is beneath those there's a lot of history here and you know actually the Romans came through here and invaded around the time of Julius Caesar and when this was called Gaul and but a very beautiful land very nice people everybody we've met so far has been really nice and even the migrant Muhammad we talked to today was very nice and very open so it's interesting to actually sit down and talk to these people and get their perspective because
[02:04:57.776 --> 02:05:01.679]  Yeah, um, that's what this world's all about, getting different perspectives from people.
[02:05:01.939 --> 02:05:04.000]  This has been Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:06.422]  We'll be following more reports from Germany.

[02:07:18.983 --> 02:07:27.090]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:32.092]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:24.843]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:08:24.863 --> 02:08:27.045]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:28.766 --> 02:08:32.288]  They're asked tough questions, others sucked up, basically.
[02:08:32.328 --> 02:08:32.769]  Like who?
[02:08:33.309 --> 02:08:39.593]  You know, well-known talk show host who you think would be asking tough questions, but has said things like, you're such an innovator, you're such an impressive guy.
[02:08:39.613 --> 02:08:40.314]  No, who said that?
[02:08:40.454 --> 02:08:42.035]  Ah, come on, you know, you can imagine.
[02:08:42.075 --> 02:08:45.438]  But the point is, they are conducting an investigation.
[02:08:45.478 --> 02:08:47.019]  They don't want to be seen as biased.
[02:08:47.219 --> 02:08:49.981]  Of course, their subjective judgments... So are they going to change anything?
[02:08:50.601 --> 02:08:59.089]  Yeah, I mean, I think they're going to try to move as much as they can over to the algorithm and take the human element out to the extent possible, but I think, you know... Did he admit to it?
[02:08:59.109 --> 02:09:04.495]  Because the curators... No, they did not admit that intentional bias occurred.
[02:09:04.535 --> 02:09:09.540]  They did admit that Silicon Valley is very liberal and the people who work there by definition are probably mostly liberal.
[02:09:10.416 --> 02:09:10.756]  Okay.
[02:09:11.456 --> 02:09:16.518]  Now, this is an important meeting, obviously, that happened a few weeks ago, and folks were asking me, some of them, like, why are you having Tucker Carlson on?
[02:09:16.558 --> 02:09:17.398]  He went to that meeting.
[02:09:17.818 --> 02:09:19.839]  I would go to Bilderberg Group meeting if they invited me.
[02:09:19.899 --> 02:09:21.459]  I would go to Davos if they invited me.
[02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:27.401]  I would have gone to this, probably, but I would have come out and said what happened and been critical of it, just like Tucker Carlson did.
[02:09:27.421 --> 02:09:32.543]  People also say, it's a minority of folks that go, listen, you know, Tucker Carlson's on Fox News.
[02:09:33.003 --> 02:09:36.084]  We also created the Daily Caller that's constantly defeating
[02:09:36.764 --> 02:09:36.924]  Yeah.
[02:09:52.634 --> 02:10:08.608]  Shows he's a good guy and also shows the liberty movement is growing and it's survivable now to be able to openly talk about global government and all the corruption in a time when journalists are getting audited and arrested and censored off of Facebook.
[02:10:08.648 --> 02:10:11.030]  So Tucker's here with us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:10:11.110 --> 02:10:14.133]  Then my exclusive interview with Roger Stone.
[02:10:14.873 --> 02:10:15.773]  We taped this Saturday.
[02:10:15.793 --> 02:10:17.094]  He had to leave because his mother died.
[02:10:17.174 --> 02:10:18.834]  He said, I just talked to my mom for the last time.
[02:10:18.874 --> 02:10:19.414]  I gotta go.
[02:10:19.674 --> 02:10:20.214]  She's gone.
[02:10:20.334 --> 02:10:21.654]  And she died last night.
[02:10:21.995 --> 02:10:22.715]  So tough guy.
[02:10:22.735 --> 02:10:32.617]  He sucked it up and came in here 10 minutes after he learned she was going any minute and did the interview to give us the inside scoop on the VP choice.
[02:10:32.697 --> 02:10:38.278]  Now, the headline here is, and we're going to premiere it, Trump VP pick leaked?
[02:10:39.964 --> 02:10:41.586]  Now, I'm not throwing stone under the bush.
[02:10:41.846 --> 02:10:43.187]  You're going to discover what really happened.
[02:10:43.547 --> 02:10:47.170]  But, you know, when I figure something out for myself, I figure it out.
[02:10:47.290 --> 02:10:52.054]  And it's not 100% set in stone, but little birdies, not just stone, little birdies said 95%.
[02:10:52.374 --> 02:10:55.917]  So you're going to hear it here first, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:56.158 --> 02:10:56.998]  We'll get Tucker's take.
[02:10:57.038 --> 02:10:59.000]  He may know as well or have a good idea.
[02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:01.422]  You know, it's kind of like when you guess it, you guess it, you can't help it.
[02:11:01.942 --> 02:11:03.604]  Tucker Carlson, great to have you here with us.
[02:11:04.284 --> 02:11:05.345]  Hey, Alex, thanks for having me.
[02:11:06.326 --> 02:11:06.566]  Wow.
[02:11:06.586 --> 02:11:08.708]  Where do you want to start with the whole Facebook situation?
[02:11:09.659 --> 02:11:16.683]  Well, I mean, I don't have much to add to it other than Glenn Beck behaved in a pretty self-discrediting way, I thought.
[02:11:17.323 --> 02:11:19.804]  I mean, it's interesting to see people around billionaires.
[02:11:20.304 --> 02:11:21.305]  I've got nothing against billionaires.
[02:11:21.345 --> 02:11:23.646]  I'm impressed by people who make their own fortunes, of course.
[02:11:24.186 --> 02:11:28.208]  But I also don't feel the need to slavishly suck up to them, to lick their boots.
[02:11:28.508 --> 02:11:29.049]  And he does.
[02:11:29.549 --> 02:11:31.190]  So that was kind of interesting.
[02:11:32.475 --> 02:11:33.516]  Yeah.
[02:11:33.797 --> 02:11:36.540]  I actually talked to somebody else that was there and they said the same thing that you said.
[02:11:37.021 --> 02:11:37.982]  How many people total?
[02:11:38.563 --> 02:11:39.304]  Refresh folks memory.
[02:11:39.484 --> 02:11:40.065]  Where did you meet?
[02:11:40.365 --> 02:11:40.886]  What was it like?
[02:11:41.347 --> 02:11:43.990]  We met at Facebook HQ outside San Francisco.
[02:11:44.871 --> 02:11:46.153]  Probably 15 people.
[02:11:46.173 --> 02:11:49.618]  Some of them you would recognize, some you wouldn't.
[02:11:50.527 --> 02:12:03.952]  Um, and basically we listened as, uh, as Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg and Peter Thiel, um, and a couple of the top engineers over at Facebook explained that they're really worried that they're going to be perceived as liberal.
[02:12:04.252 --> 02:12:10.174]  They understand that, you know, they're mostly liberals who work there, of course, that that's the pool from which they fish.
[02:12:10.514 --> 02:12:14.175]  And, um, and so they, they think it hurts their business if they're perceived that way.
[02:12:14.215 --> 02:12:19.877]  And so they're going to try to be, uh, perceived to do everything they can to make conservatives believe they're not discriminated against them.
[02:12:20.199 --> 02:12:21.440]  You know, it was kind of what you'd expect.
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:34.527]  What I didn't expect was to see Glenn Beck stand up and say, you know, you're just a remarkable innovator, you're an amazing person, and anyone who criticizes you is obviously a fascist, and it was, you know, it was ridiculous.
[02:12:34.587 --> 02:12:36.688]  He humiliated himself, I thought.
[02:12:37.711 --> 02:12:40.333]  He also said that Zuckerberg looks you in the eye all the time.
[02:12:40.393 --> 02:12:41.894]  That's what a psychopath will do.
[02:12:41.914 --> 02:12:44.335]  I get German culture, they all look you in the eye.
[02:12:44.675 --> 02:12:49.879]  I look folks in the eye a lot, but it makes people uncomfortable sometimes, so I start looking away.
[02:12:50.199 --> 02:12:59.024]  It's not that I'm trying to hide something, it's that for whatever reason, I found when I look people in the eye too long, they start basically bumbling around.
[02:12:59.044 --> 02:13:01.085]  They do!
[02:13:01.646 --> 02:13:05.668]  You know, in some cultures it's considered really an invitation to physical violence.
[02:13:05.728 --> 02:13:06.589]  It's considered way too
[02:13:07.136 --> 02:13:08.317]  Assertive, too aggressive.
[02:13:09.598 --> 02:13:12.259]  I didn't notice him looking at me in the eye.
[02:13:12.419 --> 02:13:15.221]  I was sort of looking at Sheryl Sandberg and Peter Thiel.
[02:13:15.241 --> 02:13:17.022]  Zuckerberg was fine.
[02:13:17.042 --> 02:13:19.443]  I didn't have a strong reaction to one or the other.
[02:13:19.984 --> 02:13:21.785]  But there were more interesting people in the room, in my view.
[02:13:22.045 --> 02:13:25.547]  Now, I don't normally go off people's looks, but when we pull up a photo of Zuckerberg... Oh, I do!
[02:13:26.067 --> 02:13:27.388]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:13:27.448 --> 02:13:28.609]  I'm being sarcastic, sure.
[02:13:28.909 --> 02:13:33.852]  He does look like he could actually play Nosferatu without any prosthetic fake teeth.
[02:13:33.912 --> 02:13:35.113]  I mean, he does have vampiric teeth.
[02:13:38.514 --> 02:13:39.515]  That is hilarious!
[02:13:41.656 --> 02:13:44.538]  You know, he didn't go for my neck, I'm proud to say.
[02:13:45.578 --> 02:13:48.180]  You know, we're not prepared for this, but guys, just type in his name.
[02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:50.721]  It's like the official photo they put out with his face leering.
[02:13:50.741 --> 02:13:51.602]  He looks completely scary.
[02:13:51.622 --> 02:13:58.806]  And of course, I'm being a little bit sarcastic here, but getting serious, tell us what you really think about Glenn Beck, because I'm not here just to bash other talk show hosts.
[02:13:58.866 --> 02:13:59.626]  I don't really do that.
[02:14:00.266 --> 02:14:04.829]  I read a lot of what Glenn Beck covers as a supposed libertarian, but he wanted to be the leader of the whole movement.
[02:14:05.109 --> 02:14:08.571]  He did a lot of stuff behind the scenes on affiliates we were on and with sponsors.
[02:14:09.032 --> 02:14:15.416]  I mean, this guy really, I learned, has vendettas for everybody and thinks he's the king of the universe and should run everything.
[02:14:15.436 --> 02:14:16.597]  I was told that by people at Fox.
[02:14:17.017 --> 02:14:28.545]  One time I was there to go on other shows and the Fox high-level producer, a name everyone would know, has their own show on Fox, but also produces stuff, came over, had a steak with me at lunch, or part of a steak, they had a smaller steak.
[02:14:29.085 --> 02:14:36.510]  And I sat there, after I'd just been on The View, and he looked right at me and said, Glenn Beck is climbing the walls that you're about to be let in to be on a bunch of shows.
[02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:38.391]  And I said, well, I've already been offered a show.
[02:14:38.431 --> 02:14:39.992]  They want me to do a pilot with ManCow.
[02:14:40.252 --> 02:14:41.813]  I turned that down last year.
[02:14:41.833 --> 02:14:43.414]  And I said, why does he care?
[02:14:43.434 --> 02:14:44.335]  And he goes, look, trust me.
[02:14:45.015 --> 02:14:46.036]  He runs the whole place.
[02:14:46.276 --> 02:14:47.357]  He's probably going to get kicked out.
[02:14:47.577 --> 02:14:48.278]  He's crazy.
[02:14:49.218 --> 02:14:50.819]  But he thinks he's Jesus.
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:52.200]  Now, that was the quote.
[02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:53.621]  Now, I've been told that by so many others.
[02:14:53.941 --> 02:14:54.922]  What was your take on Glenn Beck?
[02:14:55.973 --> 02:14:59.075]  Well, I mean, my general view of Glenn Beck is that he's super talented.
[02:14:59.175 --> 02:15:01.196]  I mean, he's much more talented than I am, that's for sure.
[02:15:01.236 --> 02:15:06.198]  Radio, as you know, is great preparation for any kind of broadcasting, because you have to fill all this air by yourself.
[02:15:06.438 --> 02:15:07.999]  And it takes a talented man to do that.
[02:15:08.179 --> 02:15:09.540]  Again, more talented than I am.
[02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:11.140]  Glenn Beck is a really talented guy.
[02:15:11.721 --> 02:15:16.623]  But when he started to conflate his own radio career with some sort of religious mission,
[02:15:17.128 --> 02:15:18.149]  You know, he lost me.
[02:15:18.189 --> 02:15:20.190]  And I mean, I'm a pretty mainstream Episcopalian.
[02:15:20.210 --> 02:15:21.511]  Maybe that's, maybe it's my fault.
[02:15:21.811 --> 02:15:25.354]  I didn't understand it, but there was this mystic element that crafted him.
[02:15:25.374 --> 02:15:26.174]  That's cultic!
[02:15:26.194 --> 02:15:26.775]  To his rhetoric.
[02:15:26.855 --> 02:15:28.015]  I mean, it made me uncomfortable.
[02:15:28.056 --> 02:15:29.056]  I will say that.
[02:15:29.296 --> 02:15:30.897]  He had this weird rally on the mall.
[02:15:30.917 --> 02:15:35.381]  It wasn't clear what it was about, but it had something to do with elevating him as a spiritual leader.
[02:15:35.441 --> 02:15:36.721]  And that's where he kind of lost me.
[02:15:36.741 --> 02:15:39.924]  I'm a kind of meat and potatoes, cable news guy, journalist.
[02:15:39.984 --> 02:15:41.164]  I've done it for 25 years.
[02:15:41.205 --> 02:15:41.925]  Pretty straightforward.
[02:15:41.945 --> 02:15:43.126]  You know, here's the story.
[02:15:43.166 --> 02:15:44.046]  Here's what I think it means.
[02:15:44.086 --> 02:15:46.008]  I mean, it's, you know, I'm not here
[02:15:46.616 --> 02:15:48.778]  to redeem people or to save them from hell.
[02:15:48.818 --> 02:16:02.007]  Well the really creepy part is him saying he has the only answer and that and that Cruz is this anointed one and that the children are their new priest and that if we don't do what they say we're going to hell that is Jim Jones territory.
[02:16:02.347 --> 02:16:04.328]  Well, it scared the hell out of me, I gotta say.
[02:16:04.368 --> 02:16:07.930]  And again, I don't want to be judgmental, but it freaks me out when people talk like that.
[02:16:07.950 --> 02:16:08.991]  I mean, this is politics.
[02:16:09.491 --> 02:16:12.873]  The point of politics is, by definition, it's a secular endeavor.
[02:16:13.334 --> 02:16:18.156]  We're trying to solve differences without violence, without reference to the hereafter.
[02:16:18.417 --> 02:16:23.760]  We're trying to do this in a sort of reasonable way using logic, reason, right?
[02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:27.562]  And when you all of a sudden start imputing religious motives,
[02:16:28.049 --> 02:16:28.209]  I think?
[02:16:43.889 --> 02:16:55.517]  And that's just a level of discourse I'm not comfortable with, because once you believe the person you're competing against is not just wrong but evil, it justifies almost any kind of action, including violence, and so it makes me uncomfortable.
[02:16:55.557 --> 02:17:03.282]  Sure, and that's why, the reason he got suspended off Sirius XM, and more and more I agree with it, because it's the premeditated nature of it, he's powerful,
[02:17:04.102 --> 02:17:05.523]  He's got tens of millions of listeners.
[02:17:06.023 --> 02:17:07.603]  He's messed with me, hardcore.
[02:17:08.104 --> 02:17:13.225]  I mean, like, not even the government's done this much stuff, as people have told me back behind the scenes.
[02:17:13.265 --> 02:17:19.828]  And I've experienced losing the affiliates and the sponsors and stuff with him personally trying to lean on me over the years.
[02:17:20.208 --> 02:17:24.853]  And I can't prove all of that, but he's attacked me and said I'm dangerous and said I shouldn't be on the air and stuff like that.
[02:17:25.173 --> 02:17:26.514]  So he's on record with some of it.
[02:17:26.995 --> 02:17:28.296]  He moved to Texas where I'm at.
[02:17:28.596 --> 02:17:30.718]  I mean, he copies a lot of stuff we do, but twist it.
[02:17:31.079 --> 02:17:33.481]  But he said once, you know, let me on the stage with Trump.
[02:17:33.521 --> 02:17:34.642]  I'm going to stab him a bunch.
[02:17:34.682 --> 02:17:35.343]  I wouldn't stop.
[02:17:35.663 --> 02:17:37.285]  Then he said, oh, I didn't mean that about Trump.
[02:17:37.805 --> 02:17:43.249]  And then he has this other guy on to say, well, we mean this hypothetically, but somebody needs to take him out, Trump.
[02:17:43.649 --> 02:17:46.611]  And it's the sneakiness of it that makes it so creepy.
[02:17:46.831 --> 02:17:48.132]  He's not just talking about killing Trump.
[02:17:48.432 --> 02:17:51.834]  He's trying to, like, say, somebody needs to take care of this problem.
[02:17:52.274 --> 02:17:55.176]  OK, yeah, he needs to die, but we need to watch how we say it.
[02:17:55.717 --> 02:17:58.298]  And this is a guy with hundreds of millions of dollars, or at least he used to have it.
[02:17:58.478 --> 02:17:59.099]  That's dangerous.
[02:17:59.830 --> 02:18:06.654]  Well, and also in this moment, which is a very combustible moment, I mean, anybody paying any attention at all can see where this is going.
[02:18:06.674 --> 02:18:09.055]  There have been outbreaks of violence at Trump events.
[02:18:09.075 --> 02:18:11.196]  There are going to be more, unfortunately.
[02:18:11.236 --> 02:18:15.758]  I hope it's not going to happen, but I suspect and everyone watching suspects that it will.
[02:18:16.078 --> 02:18:19.280]  This is exactly the moment when you need to kind of pull back a little bit.
[02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:26.384]  Let's not talk like that, because there are an awful lot of crazy people out there, as you well know, and some of them are on the edge of action.
[02:18:27.523 --> 02:18:28.884]  I was jokingly saying I'm one of them, but you know what?
[02:18:29.104 --> 02:18:30.505]  We were talking earlier about being a little bit crazy.
[02:18:30.665 --> 02:18:34.487]  I don't act on it, and I'm in control of my eccentric side.
[02:18:34.808 --> 02:18:39.170]  These other people tend to get some power, and they get more eccentric until they go off into la-la land.
[02:18:39.250 --> 02:18:43.173]  I'm personally worried that Glenn Beck has something like a borderline personality disorder.
[02:18:43.833 --> 02:18:48.679]  I personally, in study and life, have researched that.
[02:18:48.719 --> 02:18:53.104]  Let's just say I read a few books on it and talked to some psychologists about it because I know some folks that have it.
[02:18:53.424 --> 02:18:57.849]  And let me tell you, there's some things that they diagnose that don't exist, like oppositional
[02:18:58.490 --> 02:18:58.990]  I'm serious.
[02:19:16.738 --> 02:19:26.542]  Well, I think what all of us need in order to maintain sanity is to have a small group of people whom we trust, who have our best interest at heart, and whom we listen to, carefully, and act on their advice.
[02:19:26.622 --> 02:19:28.482]  I mean, you know... Town boards!
[02:19:28.502 --> 02:19:30.283]  We need to bounce things off, folks!
[02:19:30.463 --> 02:19:31.283]  Well, of course!
[02:19:31.383 --> 02:19:34.284]  People that you actually listen to, whose opinions you care about.
[02:19:34.725 --> 02:19:38.426]  You know, I only have three or four people in my life whose opinions I really listen carefully to.
[02:19:38.946 --> 02:19:42.847]  But if two or more of them tell me to do something, I do it, because I know that they're right.
[02:19:42.867 --> 02:19:51.529]  Same here, if my mom, my dad, my cousin Buckley, and a few other people all of a sudden say something, I know I'm wrong and I go, okay, but that's only a couple times a year.
[02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:55.551]  That's exactly, I've had that exact experience.
[02:19:55.871 --> 02:19:59.172]  And the funny thing is, in my life, one of them is named also Buckley, my brother Buckley.
[02:19:59.192 --> 02:20:04.153]  I know you've come and visited us and hung out, you're a great guy, and you were just blown away, wait, Buckley's really named Buckley.
[02:20:05.313 --> 02:20:05.573]  I know!
[02:20:05.593 --> 02:20:06.533]  Well, I've never met.
[02:20:06.614 --> 02:20:10.275]  I have a son and a brother named Buckley, and I had a grandfather named Buck.
[02:20:10.315 --> 02:20:13.596]  I've never met anybody else with that name, but I love it.
[02:20:13.636 --> 02:20:18.478]  Well, he has a name that sounds like it's something right out of the Wolf of Wall Street, you know, the Oatmonk Stratley or whatever.
[02:20:19.018 --> 02:20:26.001]  But with him, we've tracked back both our family names, but then they were fans of William F. Buckley as well, his dad and mother, so that was the coup de grace.
[02:20:26.041 --> 02:20:31.283]  But the Buckley and the Stratton and the Hammond, those are all family names connected, so yeah.
[02:20:31.523 --> 02:20:31.803]  Who knows?
[02:20:31.823 --> 02:20:32.503]  That's amazing!
[02:20:32.563 --> 02:20:33.564]  Might be related, I don't know.
[02:20:35.746 --> 02:20:37.507]  Now, again, Tucker Carlson here.
[02:20:37.727 --> 02:20:39.629]  We're looking at a massive climate of censorship.
[02:20:39.689 --> 02:20:40.850]  It's clearly intensifying.
[02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:42.491]  They're calling for it in Europe.
[02:20:42.971 --> 02:20:44.612]  Facebook's working with them in Europe doing it.
[02:20:44.872 --> 02:20:49.135]  So when Facebook says, oh, we've just got a few employees doing this, I don't really buy it.
[02:20:49.155 --> 02:21:01.303]  I mean, we've been given the three-day suspensions for really simple stuff like sending out a link that Navy SEAL sent out about Benghazi saying, you know, she didn't act and they died with just photos of their faces.
[02:21:01.703 --> 02:21:05.246]  And I don't see how I'm not allowed to post that on my own supposed site.
[02:21:05.986 --> 02:21:07.107]  No, that's a great point.
[02:21:07.167 --> 02:21:10.509]  And look, the problem with Facebook is its scale.
[02:21:10.709 --> 02:21:16.673]  I mean, Facebook has more power than any media organization in history of the world has ever had.
[02:21:16.753 --> 02:21:20.936]  It has a virtual monopoly on disseminating news.
[02:21:21.436 --> 02:21:22.176]  You know, close to it.
[02:21:22.236 --> 02:21:24.578]  Closer than any newspaper baron ever had.
[02:21:24.678 --> 02:21:27.179]  Bigger than William Randolph Hearst by, you know, 10x.
[02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:29.501]  It's a really, really big company.
[02:21:29.641 --> 02:21:32.883]  And so whenever you vest that much power in one organization,
[02:21:33.484 --> 02:21:36.886]  You run the risk that they can choke off dissent or views that they disagree with.
[02:21:36.986 --> 02:21:47.352]  I mean, my real concern with Facebook is the agreements it enters into with foreign governments to go along with their censorship of what they call hate speech, which is, of course, speech I disagree with.
[02:21:48.259 --> 02:21:49.139]  And that's not allowed.
[02:21:49.279 --> 02:21:58.122]  And Facebook really, I don't think, and Google's the same, and Twitter as well, should not, no American companies should play along with censorship in other countries.
[02:21:58.162 --> 02:22:05.684]  I mean, look, we have laws here that govern the conduct of American businesses abroad, and they say really clearly, you may not engage in bribery.
[02:22:05.844 --> 02:22:09.785]  It may be legal in Nigeria, but it's illegal here and American companies can't engage in it.
[02:22:10.305 --> 02:22:12.466]  Why do the same standards not apply to the First Amendment?
[02:22:13.027 --> 02:22:19.091]  Here, of course, we all have to abide by the Bill of Rights, and the first part of it is the First Amendment, which guarantees our right to say distressing things.
[02:22:19.772 --> 02:22:24.515]  But American companies, when they go abroad, can collaborate with the censorship of foreign governments in order to make money.
[02:22:24.655 --> 02:22:25.516]  Why is that okay?
[02:22:25.796 --> 02:22:26.276]  Exactly.
[02:22:26.296 --> 02:22:36.103]  And then it allows them, my biggest concern is, it allows them to beta test that kind of voice of Mao Zedong, voice of the Stasi control over there, with a soft rollout, and then do it here.
[02:22:36.123 --> 02:22:37.844]  And that's what I'm seeing is the soft
[02:22:38.064 --> 02:22:41.647]  Because the speech for which people abroad are being punished is speech that our elites, the left,
[02:23:07.955 --> 02:23:08.375]  I don't know.
[02:23:29.690 --> 02:23:31.130]  And nobody ever says anything about it.
[02:23:31.170 --> 02:23:35.291]  I mean, this happens literally in Great Britain, in Canada, in France, in Germany.
[02:23:35.331 --> 02:23:36.351]  People are in prison.
[02:23:36.391 --> 02:23:43.973]  Now, I don't agree with the views, by and large, those people expressed, but as an American... But if they want to deny the Holocaust, that's their business, even though I find it abhorrent.
[02:23:44.233 --> 02:23:44.573]  Exactly.
[02:23:44.593 --> 02:23:47.254]  But now it's, criticize open borders, you're arrested.
[02:23:47.414 --> 02:23:50.614]  See, once you set that precedent... Where's exactly right?
[02:23:50.754 --> 02:23:51.715]  Where's the line?
[02:23:51.835 --> 02:23:53.555]  And the line is always in the same places.
[02:23:53.575 --> 02:23:56.596]  Whatever is unfashionable, according to the people in charge.
[02:23:56.636 --> 02:23:58.336]  And that's the whole freaking point
[02:23:58.883 --> 02:24:05.628]  Of guaranteed free speech, of a First Amendment, is to say, look, this doesn't change, it's immutable, it's a right-written law.
[02:24:05.648 --> 02:24:06.209]  Absolutely.
[02:24:06.629 --> 02:24:09.531]  That can't be taken away by whatever government comes in next.
[02:24:09.591 --> 02:24:21.000]  It's more important overall, I think, than the Second Amendment, because without the right to communicate, you know, it doesn't matter if you have guns or not, you're not going to be able to mount any opposition to tyranny, and you want to fix things with words first before you go to guns.
[02:24:21.325 --> 02:24:21.945]  That's exactly right.
[02:24:22.005 --> 02:24:23.066]  That's why they're in that order.
[02:24:23.346 --> 02:24:24.027]  That's exactly right.
[02:24:24.167 --> 02:24:32.632]  First we have the conversation and then, you know, obviously violence has got to be a last resort and all people of goodwill, very much including me, hope it is a last resort.
[02:24:32.692 --> 02:24:35.453]  But if they get physical with us, if they get physical with us.
[02:24:36.094 --> 02:24:39.335]  But you don't ever want to have to exercise your Second Amendment rights.
[02:24:39.376 --> 02:24:40.056]  I mean, they're a kind of
[02:24:40.487 --> 02:24:40.687]  I don't
[02:24:55.658 --> 02:25:04.583]  I agree, I agree.
[02:25:05.083 --> 02:25:09.305]  I think these movements are more scary than what we saw with the communists over 70 years.
[02:25:09.665 --> 02:25:18.450]  Because yeah, they killed a lot of people and it was horrible, but as for the whole world being in danger of falling to tyranny, I literally think we're in the most dangerous period the world's ever seen.
[02:25:18.470 --> 02:25:23.373]  For just basic rights, family rights, property rights, First Amendment rights being under attack.
[02:25:23.413 --> 02:25:23.813]  What do you think?
[02:25:24.375 --> 02:25:27.978]  I think, of course, and we're also in the most dynamic moment of our lifetimes.
[02:25:27.998 --> 02:25:35.285]  I mean, the whole post-Second World War order imposed on the world by the victors, mostly by us, is collapsing.
[02:25:35.305 --> 02:25:36.706]  I mean, all of it is collapsing.
[02:25:36.786 --> 02:25:40.490]  The EU, on June 23rd of this year, I think Brexit is going to happen.
[02:25:41.110 --> 02:25:44.373]  I'm for it, by the way, but I think that's just the first step to the collapse of the European Union.
[02:25:44.393 --> 02:25:45.134]  This is an incredible time.
[02:25:45.174 --> 02:25:48.016]  Let me ask you that question in the minutes we have, because that's where I was going next.
[02:25:49.368 --> 02:25:52.470]  We're at a major watershed, obviously, a crossroads.
[02:25:52.930 --> 02:26:01.135]  The establishment everywhere, different establishments are trying to maintain control, use the crisis for more control, which I think is backfiring and making the awakening that much more explosive.
[02:26:01.255 --> 02:26:02.236]  I'm concerned about that.
[02:26:02.516 --> 02:26:06.058]  I'm not dreaming of some bloody revolution like the leftists and the communists are.
[02:26:06.078 --> 02:26:10.001]  I've got this lady on Infowars.com, her demo story, communist Angela Davis.
[02:26:10.481 --> 02:26:21.546]  She says Black Lives Matter, this is what we've been waiting for, and then goes in to basically say, you know, take out Trump, go after Trump politically, do whatever you have to, and then her cohort starts saying, yeah, let's kill him, and tweeting, kill him.
[02:26:21.946 --> 02:26:23.627]  I see red flags all over the country now.
[02:26:23.667 --> 02:26:28.329]  I see communists coming out from under their rocks, dreaming of some weird jihad.
[02:26:29.133 --> 02:26:29.994]  Well, exactly.
[02:26:30.214 --> 02:26:35.778]  Once these things get rolling, I mean, look, populism is always a reaction against something real.
[02:26:35.798 --> 02:26:37.059]  It doesn't happen by accident.
[02:26:37.079 --> 02:26:38.540]  These movements don't come from nowhere.
[02:26:39.060 --> 02:26:41.562]  They're a reaction against some injustice.
[02:26:41.602 --> 02:26:42.102]  That's real.
[02:26:42.142 --> 02:26:45.085]  The Trump movement, Black Lives Matter, I mean, it's all rooted in something.
[02:26:45.465 --> 02:26:48.527]  But once they get rolling, you don't know where they're going to wind up.
[02:26:48.587 --> 02:26:49.688]  That's the scary thing.
[02:26:49.768 --> 02:26:50.929]  Once these populist movements
[02:26:51.289 --> 02:26:51.910]  Get underway.
[02:26:51.930 --> 02:26:55.073]  No one's in charge of them and they can end up in a really, really ugly place.
[02:26:55.573 --> 02:26:56.254]  That's just true.
[02:26:56.294 --> 02:26:57.395]  You're right to be worried.
[02:26:57.535 --> 02:26:58.175]  All of us should be.
[02:26:58.235 --> 02:27:01.659]  And George Soros openly admits he's using these movements to overthrow country.
[02:27:01.699 --> 02:27:02.700]  So, we're in trouble.
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:02.840]  Yes.
[02:27:04.011 --> 02:27:04.891]  That's scary.
[02:27:22.236 --> 02:27:28.865]  WorldNetDaily doing great work as well, and Drudge helping magnify all that, and some of the other good talk show hosts, Hannity getting more hardcore.
[02:27:29.285 --> 02:27:29.826]  I feel good.
[02:27:29.866 --> 02:27:30.487]  I feel safer.
[02:27:30.527 --> 02:27:32.970]  I feel like we might be able to win and turn things around.
[02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:38.837]  I don't think, oh, look at that, they're bigger than me, or they have more of that big story on DailyCaller.com, or Tucker Carlson making national news.
[02:27:38.957 --> 02:27:39.678]  I feel good.
[02:27:40.239 --> 02:27:43.642]  And I wish other hosts were like we are, where we just want to try to change the culture.
[02:27:43.662 --> 02:27:46.124]  It isn't about being the only big guy out there.
[02:27:46.164 --> 02:27:49.006]  We're all, like Kennedy said, rising tide raises all ships.
[02:27:49.326 --> 02:27:52.229]  And we have to do that because they are trying to take our freedoms.
[02:27:52.249 --> 02:28:00.475]  That's why I'm here to say, even though we disagree on some things, I appreciate the work you're doing and I sleep better at night knowing you and Matt Drudge and others are there.
[02:28:00.675 --> 02:28:01.976]  What's your view overall on that?
[02:28:02.177 --> 02:28:04.819]  And then briefly, what's your take on the Trump VP situation?
[02:28:05.444 --> 02:28:07.005]  I mean, I couldn't agree with you more.
[02:28:07.045 --> 02:28:11.909]  If you have sincere beliefs, it pleases you to hear the truth spoken, no matter who it's spoken by.
[02:28:12.309 --> 02:28:12.649]  Always.
[02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:13.770]  I don't even care.
[02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:14.270]  I like it.
[02:28:14.351 --> 02:28:20.375]  I love listening to people put things, sum them up in a way that is true and real and affects them.
[02:28:21.450 --> 02:28:25.053]  Sure, you're not in competition with other libertarian or patriot groups.
[02:28:25.093 --> 02:28:25.714]  You want to win.
[02:28:26.394 --> 02:28:26.775]  I love it.
[02:28:26.795 --> 02:28:27.495]  I want more of it.
[02:28:27.615 --> 02:28:33.480]  As for his VP pick, I mean, obviously Jeff Sessions will always be my first choice because I think he's the smartest.
[02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:35.341]  He's the most impressive member of the Senate.
[02:28:35.421 --> 02:28:38.223]  I agree with him the most on immigration and trade.
[02:28:38.504 --> 02:28:39.645]  Okay, have you heard that though?
[02:28:39.665 --> 02:28:40.445]  I mean, I'm asking you.
[02:28:40.585 --> 02:28:41.326]  No, I have not heard that.
[02:28:41.346 --> 02:28:42.647]  We're about to come back with Roger Stone.
[02:28:42.667 --> 02:28:46.270]  We're going to get, I mean, I got, but I tell you, okay, so Jeff Sessions.
[02:28:47.344 --> 02:28:48.385]  I mean, that's my hope.
[02:28:48.846 --> 02:28:50.808]  And I hope he doesn't try and stunt cast it.
[02:28:50.848 --> 02:28:57.976]  I mean, my concern is he'll try to overthink it, get someone flaky who you've never heard of, who isn't smart or interesting.
[02:28:57.996 --> 02:29:01.840]  Yeah, they're talking about having Warren with Clinton for the double stunt of two women.
[02:29:02.221 --> 02:29:03.001]  No, no more gimmicks.
[02:29:03.021 --> 02:29:03.602]  We need the real deal.
[02:29:04.243 --> 02:29:05.004]  That's exactly right.
[02:29:05.854 --> 02:29:10.698]  Pick someone who believes what you believe and might do a better job of articulating.
[02:29:10.718 --> 02:29:17.543]  I mean, Trump is this amazing figure, but if I could pick one shortcoming that bothers me is he's not a good explainer sometimes.
[02:29:17.583 --> 02:29:22.747]  He doesn't get deep into why- That's right, and different leftist groups might not try to assassinate him if they know Sessions is there.
[02:29:23.808 --> 02:29:25.590]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if-
[02:29:26.158 --> 02:29:30.741]  You know, I think Trump, I think anybody in politics right now is in peril because there's so many lunatics running around.
[02:29:30.761 --> 02:29:32.062]  I don't even like to think about that stuff.
[02:29:32.082 --> 02:29:42.509]  But I do think that, what I really think is that Sessions would be a guarantee that Trump will carry out, will follow through on some of these impromises he's made or implied.
[02:29:42.949 --> 02:29:43.950]  And that's meaningful to me.
[02:29:44.190 --> 02:29:49.734]  Well, when folks spread the word about DailyCaller.com or Infowars.com or GeorgeReport.com, they are supporting free speech.
[02:29:49.794 --> 02:29:51.715]  We are under attack because we're telling the truth.
[02:29:51.936 --> 02:29:53.277]  So promote us all, listeners.
[02:29:53.337 --> 02:29:53.697]  It's key.
[02:29:53.917 --> 02:29:54.497]  Thank you, Tucker.
[02:29:54.517 --> 02:29:55.118]  Powerful interview.
[02:29:55.560 --> 02:29:56.641]  Thanks a million, Eric.
[02:29:57.201 --> 02:29:57.542]  You bet.
[02:29:57.582 --> 02:29:58.222]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:58.242 --> 02:29:58.963]  Hey, thank you, Tucker.
[02:29:58.983 --> 02:29:59.503]  That was powerful.
[02:29:59.523 --> 02:30:00.704]  We're coming back with Roger Stone.
[02:30:00.844 --> 02:30:02.405]  This is gonna be big.
[02:30:02.425 --> 02:30:04.127]  Okay, you wanna know who the VP is?
[02:30:04.307 --> 02:30:04.747]  Get ready.
[02:30:04.967 --> 02:30:06.328]  Are we about to leak it?
[02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:07.529]  Find out in three minutes.
[02:30:09.951 --> 02:30:10.952]  BrainForce is here.
[02:30:11.492 --> 02:30:13.774]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:30:14.034 --> 02:30:21.861]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:30:22.628 --> 02:30:26.211]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:30:26.231 --> 02:30:28.572]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:30:28.932 --> 02:30:32.455]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:30:32.495 --> 02:30:35.637]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:30:36.138 --> 02:30:40.941]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:30:41.481 --> 02:30:43.303]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:30:43.663 --> 02:30:48.066]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:30:48.246 --> 02:30:50.247]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:30:50.868 --> 02:30:52.349]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:30:52.489 --> 02:30:52.729]  Exactly.
[02:30:52.749 --> 02:30:56.574]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:30:57.055 --> 02:31:04.324]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:04.604 --> 02:31:05.064]  Or call 888-253-3139.
[02:31:10.035 --> 02:31:12.638]  A new tell-all book is shocking the Hillary campaign.
[02:31:12.798 --> 02:31:18.943]  Crisis of Character, a White House Secret Service officer discloses his first-hand experience with Hillary, Bill, and how they operate.
[02:31:18.963 --> 02:31:24.067]  It was written by former Secret Service agent Gary Byrne, who was posted outside the Oval Office during the Clinton years.
[02:31:24.348 --> 02:31:27.791]  The book reveals the real personality of Hillary, not the fake one you see on TV.
[02:31:28.211 --> 02:31:31.935]  And it's already at number one at Amazon despite not being released until June 28th.
[02:31:32.116 --> 02:31:33.097]  But what's in the book?
[02:31:33.357 --> 02:31:38.563]  Well, it portrays Hillary as, quote, too erratic, uncontrollable, and occasionally violent to become president.
[02:31:38.703 --> 02:31:42.367]  Byrne describes Hillary as acting friendly one moment, then raging the next.
[02:31:42.768 --> 02:31:47.794]  In fact, Secret Service agents discussed the possibility they would have to protect Bill from his wife's physical attacks.
[02:31:48.194 --> 02:31:52.176]  And the couple had one violent encounter the morning of a key presidential address to the nation.
[02:31:52.457 --> 02:32:01.062]  Byrne wrote, quote, Hillary Clinton is now poised to become the Democratic nominee for the President of the United States, but she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office.
[02:32:01.382 --> 02:32:03.643]  From the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true.
[02:32:03.923 --> 02:32:06.725]  And you can find out more at Infowars.com.
[02:32:06.785 --> 02:32:07.966]  This is Ken Daniels reporting.
[02:32:10.922 --> 02:32:17.245]  I got so busy fighting the globalists for 15 years, I turned into a giant fat slob when I was an exercise fanatic before.
[02:32:17.665 --> 02:32:20.747]  Now in the last five years, I set out to try to get back in shape.
[02:32:21.187 --> 02:32:33.033]  And to help turbocharge that, I talked to top scientists and nutraceutical developers and said, I want something that blocks these estrogen mimickers, something that helps me get back to what a real male was like instead of this globalist bombardment.
[02:32:33.593 --> 02:32:36.394]  We developed Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[02:32:36.574 --> 02:32:37.415]  They're best sellers.
[02:32:37.635 --> 02:32:38.975]  They're loved across the industry.
[02:32:39.136 --> 02:32:39.756]  They're amazing.
[02:32:40.016 --> 02:32:44.398]  You owe it to yourself to get a bottle of Super Male Vitality today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:44.778 --> 02:32:47.839]  Folks, it's so amazing what Mother Nature gave us.
[02:32:48.120 --> 02:32:51.321]  You're crazy if you don't at least try a bottle of this, because you can't lose.
[02:32:51.561 --> 02:33:00.045]  You're fighting the Info War and the fight for freedom worldwide, while at the same time getting a game-changing supplement at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:33:00.185 --> 02:33:02.405]  Super Metal Vitality is now back in stock.
[02:33:02.626 --> 02:33:04.166]  It's been sold out for several months.
[02:33:04.386 --> 02:33:09.147]  That's available at infowarestore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:33:09.207 --> 02:33:25.590]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:28.411]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:38.087 --> 02:33:44.731]  All right, I taped a 21-minute interview Saturday with Roger Stone that is going to premiere here in about two minutes.
[02:33:45.252 --> 02:33:47.553]  Then we'll go to break, come back with the rest of it.
[02:33:47.573 --> 02:33:52.016]  This hour will end, and David Knight will take over in the fourth hour.
[02:33:52.617 --> 02:33:56.039]  He'll also take over at the end of this hour to bring you into the fourth hour.
[02:33:56.839 --> 02:34:00.162]  Just briefly, I was talking about defending free speech, okay?
[02:34:01.062 --> 02:34:01.863]  It is a war.
[02:34:02.878 --> 02:34:04.319]  That is taking place for your mind right now.
[02:34:04.379 --> 02:34:05.040]  It's an info war.
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:12.725]  And the globalists never intended that people would reverse engineer their operation, figure it out, read their own white papers by the hundreds and take action against them.
[02:34:12.845 --> 02:34:13.306]  I've done that.
[02:34:14.126 --> 02:34:19.731]  And I've seen my perspective and my research that I got from patriots, the John Birch Society and others.
[02:34:20.011 --> 02:34:20.991]  They put me on the trail.
[02:34:21.312 --> 02:34:22.553]  I did deep research as well.
[02:34:23.193 --> 02:34:24.494]  But I'm not territorializing that.
[02:34:24.634 --> 02:34:29.658]  The point is, I've seen myself in 21 years change the narrative massively.
[02:34:31.753 --> 02:34:42.879]  And the talking points and the specific angles and the nomenclature, the words, the lexicon that I've created now become adopted worldwide in intelligentsia and political circles.
[02:34:44.399 --> 02:34:52.984]  That's not bragging, that's as a battle report to you to say if some scrapper from Texas
[02:34:54.639 --> 02:34:55.359]  Can change the world.
[02:34:55.399 --> 02:34:56.560]  You can change the world as well.
[02:34:56.620 --> 02:34:57.741]  And you are the info warriors.
[02:34:58.001 --> 02:35:01.883]  It's been my interfacing with you that has been 99.9% of the action.
[02:35:02.143 --> 02:35:07.305]  But it was my intention and my engagement and my will that helped light the fuse.
[02:35:08.206 --> 02:35:09.106]  So we're winning.
[02:35:09.146 --> 02:35:09.927]  We're moving forward.
[02:35:09.967 --> 02:35:15.950]  But more than ever, when I tell Tucker Carlson, hey, people need to support what you're doing because they are under attack.
[02:35:16.823 --> 02:35:18.424]  This isn't just free speech that's under attack.
[02:35:18.464 --> 02:35:25.929]  These are the groups, the organizations, like InfoWars, that is attacked by White House mouthpieces and Clinton operatives all the time.
[02:35:26.229 --> 02:35:30.532]  Make no mistake, I take my life in my hands every day going up against these people.
[02:35:31.813 --> 02:35:33.114]  But I'm not a hero.
[02:35:33.834 --> 02:35:35.135]  It's self-preservation.
[02:35:35.215 --> 02:35:36.916]  I'd be insane not to do that.
[02:35:38.457 --> 02:35:39.658]  So this video's not out yet.
[02:35:39.678 --> 02:35:42.860]  We're going to post it at the end of the hour to InfoWars.com, red-linked.
[02:35:44.957 --> 02:35:48.199]  And the big issue here is, who is the VP pick?
[02:35:48.239 --> 02:35:49.039]  It's so important.
[02:35:49.759 --> 02:35:53.201]  And I have pretty much accurately predicted who is on the short list.
[02:35:53.861 --> 02:35:54.502]  Let's just say that.
[02:35:54.582 --> 02:35:55.262]  Stone goes over it.
[02:35:55.282 --> 02:35:56.103]  But I have other sources.
[02:35:56.123 --> 02:35:56.723]  I want to be clear.
[02:35:57.163 --> 02:35:58.884]  Stone is not the source of this.
[02:35:59.264 --> 02:35:59.925]  On record, he's not.
[02:36:00.505 --> 02:36:06.468]  But he believes my analysis is correct, is the right thing to do, and is where this is going.
[02:36:06.988 --> 02:36:11.210]  And so it's fair for me, he said, to say that I think this is the best choice, and I think this is who it is.
[02:36:11.370 --> 02:36:12.471]  Because that's his opinion, too.
[02:36:12.811 --> 02:36:14.172]  So you're going to find out in a moment.
[02:36:14.972 --> 02:36:16.873]  But he's been best buddies with Trump.
[02:36:17.253 --> 02:36:18.233]  I mean, these are running buddies.
[02:36:18.253 --> 02:36:20.074]  The other guys are political analysts.
[02:36:20.114 --> 02:36:22.414]  These are running buddies that argue with each other and everything else.
[02:36:22.474 --> 02:36:25.135]  I mean, Stone's the only guy that's not a yes-man to Trump, basically.
[02:36:25.155 --> 02:36:26.095]  He wants the inside baseball.
[02:36:26.355 --> 02:36:27.416]  He's a really interesting guy.
[02:36:27.496 --> 02:36:29.816]  God, he wanted to get to know me years ago and I was too busy.
[02:36:30.376 --> 02:36:31.637]  And now I want to be friends with this guy.
[02:36:31.717 --> 02:36:34.478]  I mean, no wonder he was like best buddies with Nixon after Nixon got out of office.
[02:36:35.118 --> 02:36:36.818]  You know, they hung out and everything a lot.
[02:36:36.838 --> 02:36:38.039]  I mean, like on a weekly basis.

[02:37:23.888 --> 02:37:28.330]  I mean, it's independent media doing the job of the prostitute media, the Decepticon media.

[02:37:51.624 --> 02:37:55.167]  It's an excellent unit, and I personally bought one of these.
[02:37:55.808 --> 02:38:00.012]  We also, you know, more and more here at the office are trying to move to solar.

[02:38:54.758 --> 02:38:58.400]  Okay, without further ado, we will go ahead and go to the Roger Stone piece.
[02:38:58.420 --> 02:39:03.783]  We're going to run this up to break, come back in the next segment and finish it up, and then David and I will be taking over.
[02:39:04.384 --> 02:39:07.806]  So here it is, the VP for Trump leaked question mark.
[02:39:09.477 --> 02:39:10.237]  And we are back.
[02:39:10.417 --> 02:39:16.921]  Roger Stone, Trump insider, former head of his campaign, confidant, is here in studio with us.
[02:39:16.961 --> 02:39:18.021]  This is part three.
[02:39:18.641 --> 02:39:20.782]  He came in Friday, was live on air with us.
[02:39:21.123 --> 02:39:24.804]  Over the weekend, we war-gamed how to make this country free and great again.
[02:39:25.545 --> 02:39:26.865]  And I pressed him hard.
[02:39:27.205 --> 02:39:28.566]  Who is the VP pick?
[02:39:29.366 --> 02:39:30.427]  Has Trump decided yet?
[02:39:31.247 --> 02:39:31.928]  And he said, you know,
[02:39:33.058 --> 02:39:41.047]  I'm not going to tell you what I think or what I know until we do just a special report, and we will put it out there to the public.
[02:39:41.348 --> 02:39:43.350]  But he said only one man knows, and that's Donald Trump.
[02:39:43.911 --> 02:39:47.695]  And I said, okay, well, I have no dog in the fight against Corey Lewandowski.
[02:39:48.356 --> 02:39:51.059]  And I defended him when that woman said he pushed her down and all that.
[02:39:51.079 --> 02:39:52.701]  It looked like he just kind of shoved her, but whatever.
[02:39:54.793 --> 02:39:58.178]  But he is on Fox last Sunday and all over saying he's running it.
[02:39:58.558 --> 02:39:59.259]  He's deciding.
[02:39:59.740 --> 02:40:01.643]  So I ask you, hey, what goes on in these meetings?
[02:40:01.863 --> 02:40:02.444]  Who are we looking at?
[02:40:02.464 --> 02:40:03.485]  You go, I'm not going to say.
[02:40:03.886 --> 02:40:05.448]  Trump hasn't totally decided yet.
[02:40:06.377 --> 02:40:09.079]  But then I see Lewandowski running around saying he's deciding.
[02:40:09.539 --> 02:40:12.501]  And I'm like, does Trump know that this is going on?
[02:40:12.541 --> 02:40:15.904]  Because you tell me Trump is all about being his own man.
[02:40:15.924 --> 02:40:17.565]  I'm not attacking Lewandowski.
[02:40:17.605 --> 02:40:24.430]  It just isn't congruent with everything else I've seen from Donald Trump that Lewandowski seems to say he's quarterbacking the whole deal.
[02:40:24.470 --> 02:40:28.053]  So I see who's commenting on Infowars.com and on YouTube.
[02:40:28.293 --> 02:40:29.293]  I have staff
[02:40:30.234 --> 02:40:30.794]  We're good to go.
[02:41:01.215 --> 02:41:11.485]  My view here is very simple, and that is, I'm sorry if I have to scoff at Corey Lewandowski, but Donald Trump is going to make this decision, and he's going to play his cards extremely close to the vest.
[02:41:12.226 --> 02:41:16.350]  He's going to throw out some names that are really in contention.
[02:41:16.410 --> 02:41:21.935]  He's going to throw out some names of people that he wants to give a wet kiss to, but really aren't on the short list.
[02:41:22.396 --> 02:41:23.377]  What is the short list?
[02:41:23.957 --> 02:41:24.998]  Only Donald Trump knows.
[02:41:25.178 --> 02:41:26.880]  I think the shortlist is in flux.
[02:41:27.100 --> 02:41:29.943]  I think that he is still considering his options.
[02:41:30.003 --> 02:41:33.387]  Now, you pointed out what I think is the most important criteria.
[02:41:33.427 --> 02:41:37.651]  Look, Nixon saw the assassination of JFK up close.
[02:41:38.251 --> 02:41:45.118]  He told me personally, one of the reasons he chose Agnew was as an insurance policy against assassination.
[02:41:45.819 --> 02:41:47.980]  Trump has got to be mindful of that.
[02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:51.121]  Now, some will say, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:41:51.161 --> 02:41:51.461]  Really?
[02:41:51.721 --> 02:41:53.042]  They tried to kill Ronald Reagan.
[02:41:53.262 --> 02:41:54.623]  They did kill Jack Kennedy.
[02:41:54.923 --> 02:41:56.743]  So it's not an unrealistic question.
[02:41:57.144 --> 02:41:58.924]  Trump has proven to be fearless.
[02:41:59.345 --> 02:42:02.306]  But I think it's essential that he choose someone
[02:42:03.126 --> 02:42:12.270]  Who tracks his views, who is not a globalist, who is a nationalist, who agrees with him, particularly on the issue of immigration.
[02:42:12.650 --> 02:42:21.774]  Therefore, I think by process of elimination, one of the strongest contenders, the name you brought up, a guy that I like myself, would be Senator Jeff Sessions.
[02:42:21.814 --> 02:42:26.575]  Now, I've known Sessions back to the Alabama Young Republicans in the 80s.
[02:42:26.916 --> 02:42:32.398]  That's how long I've known him and I've known his reputation for fortitude and his leadership capabilities.
[02:42:33.018 --> 02:42:34.978]  Am I saying Trump has chosen Sessions?
[02:42:35.038 --> 02:42:35.238]  No.
[02:42:35.739 --> 02:42:40.659]  I think Joni Ernst, the senator from Iowa, is one of the candidates under consideration.
[02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:49.421]  I think that Miriam and Sheldon Adelson have very aggressively advocated Newt Gingrich, who I like personally.
[02:42:49.481 --> 02:42:55.142]  I think there's some drawbacks to his candidacy, but I think he is one that Donald Trump has under consideration.
[02:42:55.762 --> 02:42:59.403]  On the other hand, I think the short list is an evolving list.
[02:43:00.043 --> 02:43:01.124]  Only one man knows.
[02:43:01.664 --> 02:43:02.705]  It's not Roger Stone.
[02:43:03.105 --> 02:43:04.266]  It's not Paul Manafort.
[02:43:04.606 --> 02:43:06.367]  It's certainly not Corey Lewandowski.
[02:43:06.848 --> 02:43:07.588]  It's Donald Trump.
[02:43:07.708 --> 02:43:09.549]  I don't even think Melania Trump knows.
[02:43:10.210 --> 02:43:12.291]  He understands the news value of this.
[02:43:12.592 --> 02:43:14.793]  He understands the blockbuster headlines.
[02:43:14.813 --> 02:43:15.594]  Sure, Roger, but...
[02:43:16.374 --> 02:43:18.095]  Your eyes did get big and you did gulp.
[02:43:18.115 --> 02:43:19.095]  I've never seen you do that before.
[02:43:19.115 --> 02:43:20.135]  We've hung out a lot in private.
[02:43:20.595 --> 02:43:31.239]  When I said Senator Sessions is who I think he's going to go with, in my gut, and you gulped and you said, well, I'm not saying that, and you didn't get that from me, but you had a physical response when I said that.
[02:43:31.299 --> 02:43:34.120]  Well, here's why I think I may have had this response.
[02:43:35.140 --> 02:43:38.703]  I've seen the chemistry between Trump and Sessions.
[02:43:38.763 --> 02:43:39.023]  I have too.
[02:43:39.043 --> 02:43:40.144]  It's very positive.
[02:43:40.244 --> 02:43:42.766]  I think that Donald appreciates Sessions.
[02:43:42.826 --> 02:43:45.728]  I think he's honored to have his early support.
[02:43:46.169 --> 02:43:50.792]  And they're copacetic on the single most important issue in this campaign, I think, immigration.
[02:43:51.132 --> 02:43:52.754]  So I'm reading the tea leaves.
[02:43:52.894 --> 02:43:54.055]  I don't know anything.
[02:43:54.115 --> 02:43:58.638]  No one has said to me it's going to be Jeff Sessions or Trump has decided on this one or that one.
[02:43:58.978 --> 02:44:04.603]  We're not going to know until, drum roll, he announces it at the Republican National Convention.
[02:44:05.023 --> 02:44:06.524]  But, uh, this I do know.
[02:44:06.584 --> 02:44:08.244]  I think Sessions is in contention.
[02:44:08.284 --> 02:44:09.525]  I think he's a strong candidate.
[02:44:09.905 --> 02:44:12.866]  From a personal point of view, Alex, that's who I would prefer.
[02:44:12.927 --> 02:44:14.907]  So maybe I'm projecting my own views.
[02:44:15.228 --> 02:44:17.188]  So when you heard me with my view, it just resonated.
[02:44:17.208 --> 02:44:17.709]  You were like, oh.
[02:44:17.769 --> 02:44:20.890]  Well, and I've also, I've personally seen the chemistry between the two.
[02:44:20.930 --> 02:44:28.456]  I was about to say, plus it's the cool guy, I mean it's the cool fact that they're like buddies, and one's a Southerner and one's a Northerner, it's just good to bring America together.
[02:44:28.496 --> 02:44:32.559]  And I don't want the gimmick of just picking a woman to get female votes.
[02:44:32.639 --> 02:44:37.023]  If a woman was the right choice, because she had views that were great and all this, I would say I'd support a woman.
[02:44:37.043 --> 02:44:38.444]  I don't care if the president's a woman, I'd love it.
[02:44:38.864 --> 02:44:49.453]  And these women are great, I'm sure, but just the gimmick of leftist women having a woman just hoping they vote for you, I get it, I see the arithmetic, I see the calculus, but I just say screw
[02:44:49.633 --> 02:44:51.654]  Screw all the surface stuff, go for what's real.
[02:45:10.020 --> 02:45:16.264]  You know, he wants to give a wet kiss to Robert Corker, Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
[02:45:16.704 --> 02:45:18.365]  Is Corker really a contender?
[02:45:18.886 --> 02:45:19.987]  Only Donald Trump knows.
[02:45:20.127 --> 02:45:21.027]  Personally, I doubt it.
[02:45:21.488 --> 02:45:22.888]  But that's just my opinion.
[02:45:23.209 --> 02:45:26.171]  I've watched Trump's body language with Sessions four or five times.
[02:45:26.191 --> 02:45:27.251]  He doesn't do it with anybody else.
[02:45:27.772 --> 02:45:32.635]  He literally bites his teeth and savors and just looks at him like he's in love with him.
[02:45:33.395 --> 02:45:39.857]  I mean, I'm sorry, the body language is something I've never seen in Trump, other than when he's, I mean, he really likes Sessions.
[02:45:40.317 --> 02:45:40.977]  Three factors.
[02:45:41.397 --> 02:45:43.318]  One, let's go back to Nixon's advice.
[02:45:43.638 --> 02:45:46.579]  Don't look for someone who helps you, look for someone who won't hurt you.
[02:45:46.939 --> 02:45:47.579]  Jeff Sessions.
[02:45:47.599 --> 02:45:48.299]  He trusts Sessions.
[02:45:48.459 --> 02:45:50.280]  Sessions would be a safe choice.
[02:45:50.320 --> 02:45:51.560]  He'd be a good vice president.
[02:45:51.980 --> 02:45:54.261]  He could be counted on to carry the Trump
[02:45:54.841 --> 02:45:55.482]  We shall see.
[02:45:55.542 --> 02:45:57.143]  There's only one man alive who knows.
[02:45:57.704 --> 02:45:58.625]  That's Donald Trump.
[02:46:18.504 --> 02:46:24.371]  And I hope he takes a Hippocratic oath and does no harm and does, Senator Sessions of Alabama, because that guy's a patriot.
[02:46:24.431 --> 02:46:25.632]  He's exposed all the treason.
[02:46:26.012 --> 02:46:30.718]  We know he's helping advise Trump on foreign policy to a certain extent about the Chinese selling the country.
[02:46:30.738 --> 02:46:32.520]  And they always go, oh, you're racist against Chinese.
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:34.101]  Look, my sister's Korean-adopted.
[02:46:34.362 --> 02:46:35.103]  I love everybody.
[02:46:35.183 --> 02:46:35.984]  OK, I'm sick of this.
[02:46:36.324 --> 02:46:38.647]  China's run by horrible, murdering communists.
[02:46:39.207 --> 02:46:47.738]  The Clintons gave him missile secrets so they could destroy the whole United States, and they're in here controlling Hollywood and the media and censoring Michael Savage's book.
[02:46:47.838 --> 02:46:49.861]  I mean, you know, I'm just sick of it.
[02:46:49.901 --> 02:46:54.206]  I don't want anybody, whether it's Russia or Israel or Germany or England or Mexico,
[02:46:54.887 --> 02:46:55.127]  Come on!
[02:47:13.436 --> 02:47:21.220]  But look, our enemies want to mount this country's head on the wall for perceived ills or the dominance of the West or whatever it is.
[02:47:21.280 --> 02:47:27.323]  They've sold this whole cultural envy garbage, and they're funding all these groups to balkanize the nation.
[02:47:27.343 --> 02:47:29.123]  That's what the multinationals are doing to make us a joke.
[02:47:30.104 --> 02:47:33.866]  Illegals running around with Mexican flags, beating women up, and the media says it's a good thing.
[02:47:34.126 --> 02:47:35.606]  The mayor says in San Jose it's a good thing.
[02:47:35.626 --> 02:47:36.187]  This is crazy.
[02:47:36.427 --> 02:47:40.409]  We need Donald Trump to counterbalance what's been going on and to make nationalism
[02:47:41.389 --> 02:47:43.913]  Okay, again and just counter the political correctness.
[02:47:43.933 --> 02:47:54.088]  So that's my point on that but separately money Trump didn't take any money in the in the first phase of the campaign People say well, he'll go back now if he does he has to to win
[02:47:55.350 --> 02:48:01.174]  So how do we juxtapose this saying I'm not going to take super PAC money or at least the primaries?
[02:48:01.194 --> 02:48:02.095]  Well, he's not in the primary now.
[02:48:02.335 --> 02:48:05.237]  Hillary's got all the multinationals that have conquered the country giving her all this money.
[02:48:06.258 --> 02:48:09.960]  For me, it's essential that people realize if you're all in, you're all in.
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:10.961]  It's time to donate.
[02:48:11.321 --> 02:48:13.823]  It's time to send videos and campaign ads to people.
[02:48:13.863 --> 02:48:18.186]  It's time to get politically involved because they're coming after our free speech across the board.
[02:48:18.226 --> 02:48:22.469]  Drugs report, Infowars, the Federal Election Commission wants to shut us down.
[02:48:22.809 --> 02:48:24.751]  So now it's use our political power
[02:48:25.151 --> 02:48:26.392]  Use our First Amendment or lose it.
[02:48:26.612 --> 02:48:27.752]  We got three minutes to break.
[02:48:28.132 --> 02:48:29.613]  On the money issue, Roger Stone.
[02:48:29.733 --> 02:48:35.536]  I'm really glad you asked this question, Alex, because it's one I get every day from rank-and-file small donors.
[02:48:35.616 --> 02:48:39.497]  The people who give $25, the people who give $50, the people who give $100.
[02:48:39.598 --> 02:48:42.019]  Not talking about the fat cats.
[02:48:42.119 --> 02:48:44.300]  Now, the Clinton people are right.
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:53.684]  Because Trump did not take and raise money during the nomination phase, there is a ramp-up period in which he has to build a finance operation.
[02:48:54.364 --> 02:48:55.305]  He would be foolish
[02:49:12.324 --> 02:49:23.876]  Closest personal friends, truly a confidant, a peer, if you will, has announced the formation of the America First PAC and $37 million worth of hard commitments.
[02:49:24.356 --> 02:49:26.739]  I see this as the number one PAC to help Trump.
[02:49:27.079 --> 02:49:28.821]  I think it is a hard money PAC.
[02:49:29.161 --> 02:49:31.043]  I think it's a big money PAC.
[02:49:31.404 --> 02:49:33.466]  Then you have, as I'm sure you have heard,
[02:49:34.086 --> 02:49:35.427]  Great America pact.
[02:49:35.487 --> 02:49:40.269]  They're very aggressive out among the internet, email, and so on.
[02:49:40.669 --> 02:49:41.850]  This is a scam.
[02:49:42.010 --> 02:49:45.451]  This is not the place to go if you want to- Isn't it run by a fellow named Jesse Benton?
[02:49:45.552 --> 02:49:49.533]  It is run by Jesse Benton, but more importantly, it's run by a fellow named Ed Rollins.
[02:49:50.334 --> 02:49:59.998]  And Rollins, while he may have worked for Ronald Reagan at one time, currently works at Teneo Strategies, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Clinton, Inc.
[02:50:00.118 --> 02:50:01.379]  So he's a turncoat Brock type?
[02:50:01.539 --> 02:50:03.601]  I think this is a sabotage operation.
[02:50:03.721 --> 02:50:09.065]  I cannot in good conscience urge anybody out there to send a dollar to the Great America Pact.
[02:50:09.125 --> 02:50:12.107]  Then you have the Committee for American Sovereignty.
[02:50:12.808 --> 02:50:16.811]  I think this is a legit operation run by a very skilled guy named Doug Watts.
[02:50:17.331 --> 02:50:23.136]  I think Watts really has the Trump campaign in his interests, in his sights.
[02:50:23.176 --> 02:50:24.177]  He's trying to be helpful.
[02:50:24.757 --> 02:50:31.283]  There's an august committee of Americans including some former Trump executives, some retired military.
[02:50:31.303 --> 02:50:32.204]  We're almost out of time.
[02:50:32.304 --> 02:50:32.824]  I'd go there.
[02:50:33.105 --> 02:50:36.127]  You know what, I'm going to skip the break so we have a few more minutes here with Roger Stone.
[02:50:36.147 --> 02:50:37.669]  We're going to go to a break actually.
[02:50:38.029 --> 02:50:40.871]  This is David Knight and that's Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[02:50:41.252 --> 02:50:45.556]  If you want to see that video, it is up on the Real Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[02:50:45.596 --> 02:50:47.537]  That is Trump VP pic leaked?
[02:50:47.697 --> 02:50:50.480]  We're going to play the rest of that when we come back.
[02:50:51.209 --> 02:50:56.097]  Amazing Inside Politics with Roger Stones and Alex Jones and we'll be right back.
[02:51:10.293 --> 02:51:15.816]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[02:51:16.297 --> 02:51:20.279]  Unveil Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[02:51:20.959 --> 02:51:24.201]  30 servings, fruit, punch, flavor, dietary supplement.
[02:51:24.522 --> 02:51:25.582]  It is simply amazing.
[02:51:25.642 --> 02:51:26.583]  Infowarslife.com
[02:51:26.983 --> 02:51:31.385]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[02:51:31.905 --> 02:51:45.010]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[02:51:45.390 --> 02:51:46.570]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[02:51:46.610 --> 02:51:47.791]  I put it in my protein shake.
[02:51:48.411 --> 02:51:53.916]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[02:51:53.936 --> 02:51:56.959]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[02:51:56.999 --> 02:51:59.241]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[02:51:59.842 --> 02:52:05.987]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[02:52:06.208 --> 02:52:08.570]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[02:52:08.930 --> 02:52:10.792]  Okay, this- Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[02:52:10.812 --> 02:52:13.134]  Yeah, this- I wanna- but again, there's some great stuff out there.
[02:52:13.314 --> 02:52:14.154]  Yeah.
[02:52:14.174 --> 02:52:18.096]  And there's other powders I promote at Infowarshealth.com that are excellent.
[02:52:18.477 --> 02:52:19.697]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[02:52:19.857 --> 02:52:22.519]  This is just the very best we can bring you.
[02:52:22.539 --> 02:52:24.580]  And when you buy it, you support Infowars.
[02:52:24.860 --> 02:52:25.900]  You support the reporters.
[02:52:26.140 --> 02:52:26.881]  You support yourself.
[02:52:28.120 --> 02:52:47.686]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this and why this is just this total complete package for your body because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[02:52:48.206 --> 02:52:48.826]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:52:48.866 --> 02:52:52.007]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[02:52:52.107 --> 02:52:53.347]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[02:52:53.367 --> 02:52:54.287]  Tell folks about that.
[02:52:54.347 --> 02:52:56.867]  A thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[02:52:57.748 --> 02:53:00.368]  As the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[02:53:00.948 --> 02:53:03.449]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[02:53:03.689 --> 02:53:07.289]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[02:53:07.729 --> 02:53:10.930]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[02:53:11.370 --> 02:53:12.470]  34 other ones you can check out.
[02:53:12.670 --> 02:53:14.510]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[02:53:15.031 --> 02:53:17.331]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[02:53:17.731 --> 02:53:25.133]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just... By the way, look on the other side too, because we're showing people the minerals and things.
[02:53:25.173 --> 02:53:27.034]  Let's look at the vitamins right there, old Scott, in there.
[02:53:27.054 --> 02:53:27.714]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:53:27.734 --> 02:53:28.234]  Top left.
[02:53:28.294 --> 02:53:31.635]  Again, if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:53:31.995 --> 02:53:34.756]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and... What's the other source?
[02:53:34.776 --> 02:53:36.596]  I can show this to all the best sources.
[02:53:40.191 --> 02:53:40.611]  Retinol.
[02:53:40.631 --> 02:53:45.095]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[02:53:45.435 --> 02:53:45.855]  And you know what?
[02:53:45.915 --> 02:53:48.077]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[02:53:48.317 --> 02:53:48.897]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[02:53:48.937 --> 02:53:55.942]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[02:53:56.263 --> 02:54:01.807]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[02:54:02.307 --> 02:54:03.128]  So get them today.
[02:54:03.228 --> 02:54:05.269]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:54:18.584 --> 02:54:21.598]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday 6-6-16.
[02:54:24.375 --> 02:54:25.836]  Of course, I just mentioned that to Alex Jones.
[02:54:25.876 --> 02:54:27.977]  He says, oh, we've got to do Facebook mentions on that.
[02:54:27.997 --> 02:54:29.758]  We're going to come in and talk about what's going on with that.
[02:54:29.778 --> 02:54:32.200]  Because we've seen a lot of news this week.
[02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:34.181]  We've had the Satanists in L.A.
[02:54:34.261 --> 02:54:41.845]  saying that they're going to set up a pentagram and mark out the five points around L.A., claiming it for Satan, as if that already hadn't been done.
[02:54:42.365 --> 02:54:45.587]  Don't you think it's kind of redundant to do that for Hollywood in L.A.?
[02:54:45.647 --> 02:54:46.168]  Maybe it is.
[02:54:46.248 --> 02:54:50.950]  But we also had, we're going to cover this in detail tonight on the nightly news.
[02:54:50.990 --> 02:54:53.352]  We talked about it a little bit yesterday on the Sunday Show.
[02:54:54.032 --> 02:55:01.659]  But there was a very strange occultic ritual that was part of the Goddard Rail Tunnel that just opened in Switzerland.
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:03.821]  You won't believe the video of that.
[02:55:03.841 --> 02:55:07.524]  We're going to show that to you on the Nightly News and talk about what's going on with that as well.
[02:55:07.584 --> 02:55:10.027]  But Alex will be coming in and joining us in the next segment.
[02:55:10.687 --> 02:55:17.071]  Now, that report where Alex was talking to Roger Stone about the inside politics, who is Donald Trump going to pick for VP?
[02:55:17.131 --> 02:55:22.093]  And of course, Roger Stone is not going to say, if he knows, who that's going to be.
[02:55:22.173 --> 02:55:25.375]  But the person I would like to see is Jeff Sessions.
[02:55:25.415 --> 02:55:28.036]  And by the way, there's about seven minutes left on that report.
[02:55:28.056 --> 02:55:30.698]  If you want to see that, that's going up on our YouTube channel now.
[02:55:32.025 --> 02:55:37.888]  But if we go back and we look at Jeff Sessions, the only person he's ever endorsed for president is Donald Trump.
[02:55:38.528 --> 02:55:43.350]  And he's been working with Donald Trump since last August, filling him in on what's going on with the borders.
[02:55:43.370 --> 02:55:45.571]  And this isn't something that is new to Donald Trump.
[02:55:46.212 --> 02:55:59.378]  He was talking about the unfair trade deals, going back 30, 35 years ago, running ads in the New York Times, spending $100,000 to talk about how awful NAFTA was and these other trade deals, which, by the way,
[02:55:59.978 --> 02:56:06.684]  We've now seen, after 25-30 years of NAFTA, we've seen what that has done to our trade.
[02:56:07.144 --> 02:56:13.490]  With Mexico, with Canada, we've seen the jobs, the giant sucking sound that Ross Perot was telling us about.
[02:56:13.510 --> 02:56:15.011]  It's now been verified.
[02:56:15.031 --> 02:56:16.813]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:56:17.153 --> 02:56:18.695]  It is an accomplished fact.
[02:56:19.417 --> 02:56:22.719]  We had roughly equal trade with Mexico until they passed NAFTA.
[02:56:23.140 --> 02:56:28.564]  Immediately, it went to a $15 billion deficit, and it has increased since then.
[02:56:28.984 --> 02:56:32.447]  We had $60 billion trade deficit just this last year.
[02:56:32.467 --> 02:56:35.669]  So we got massive export of capital, of jobs.
[02:56:35.729 --> 02:56:38.071]  We have the massive import of workers.
[02:56:38.371 --> 02:56:40.573]  This is something Donald Trump has been on for a very long time.
[02:56:40.793 --> 02:56:47.318]  But nobody has been on the Trans-Pacific and the Transatlantic Partnership deals, these newest trade treaties.
[02:56:47.998 --> 02:56:53.822]  Which are a major step towards globalization, and they are far greater than just the economic issues.
[02:56:54.603 --> 02:57:03.089]  These two so-called partnership agreements have massive import for our sovereignty, and Jeff Sessions understands that.
[02:57:03.129 --> 02:57:08.173]  It has massive impact on our freedom of speech, on control of the internet, on so many different things.
[02:57:08.273 --> 02:57:10.555]  Jeff Sessions is the only senator
[02:57:11.215 --> 02:57:18.038]  To look at this, to study it, to create a presentation for his fellow senators who are so disinterested they didn't want to look at it.
[02:57:18.078 --> 02:57:30.703]  So he thought, well, let me explain it to them how awful this is, how we are turning over the management of our economy to a foreign organization that is not elected or accountable to us or any other government.
[02:57:31.423 --> 02:57:35.705]  And they're going to manage our economy, and it is going to be a living document.
[02:57:35.725 --> 02:57:41.247]  And when you hear people talk about that with the Constitution, you ought to take the safety off of your gun.
[02:57:41.868 --> 02:57:43.248]  Because that's when it gets really dangerous.
[02:57:43.268 --> 02:57:50.431]  But we're talking about an economic trade treaty, something that also controls the internet, that is going to be a living document.
[02:57:50.451 --> 02:57:53.212]  So he's tried to educate other senators about this.
[02:57:53.713 --> 02:57:54.713]  Nobody cared about that.
[02:57:55.193 --> 02:57:56.614]  But Donald Trump did care about it.
[02:57:57.274 --> 02:57:58.795]  And he educated him on it.
[02:57:58.835 --> 02:58:00.955]  He's been tutoring him since last August.
[02:58:01.215 --> 02:58:09.178]  His former Chief of Staff is now Stephen Miller, who is now the Chief Foreign Policy Advisor to Donald Trump.
[02:58:09.318 --> 02:58:11.319]  I would love to see Jeff Sessions, because you know what?
[02:58:11.599 --> 02:58:14.120]  There's also a geographical balance there.
[02:58:14.180 --> 02:58:16.360]  Somebody from the South versus somebody from the North.
[02:58:16.380 --> 02:58:24.703]  There's also a balance of temperaments there between the brusque, kind of inarticulate, but in-your-face Donald Trump.
[02:58:25.163 --> 02:58:30.069]  And a very careful, spoken, former judge, Senator Sessions.
[02:58:30.169 --> 02:58:33.372]  So if you want to see the rest of that report, we've got seven minutes of that left.
[02:58:33.413 --> 02:58:35.695]  You can see it on the Real Alex Jones Channel.
[02:58:35.975 --> 02:58:37.037]  We're going to be right back.
[02:58:37.157 --> 02:58:43.604]  Alex Jones is going to be doing a live Facebook mention talking about 6-6-16 and what's behind it.
[02:58:43.704 --> 02:58:44.225]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:52.708 --> 02:58:56.751]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:59:00.734 --> 02:59:01.735]  Brain Force is here.
[02:59:02.275 --> 02:59:04.557]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:59:04.817 --> 02:59:12.643]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:59:13.413 --> 02:59:16.996]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[02:59:17.016 --> 02:59:19.358]  You're gonna crash, you're gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:59:19.718 --> 02:59:23.221]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:59:23.281 --> 02:59:26.424]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:59:26.924 --> 02:59:31.728]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:59:32.248 --> 02:59:34.070]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[02:59:34.430 --> 02:59:38.874]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:59:39.014 --> 02:59:41.035]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:59:41.656 --> 02:59:43.117]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:59:43.257 --> 02:59:43.517]  Exactly.
[02:59:43.537 --> 02:59:47.318]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:59:47.818 --> 02:59:55.100]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:55.320 --> 02:59:57.021]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:18.118 --> 03:00:23.010]  Another world, another time, in the age of one.
[03:00:38.443 --> 03:00:42.405]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:43.085 --> 03:00:49.068]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:50.509 --> 03:00:52.370]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:52.390 --> 03:00:54.891]  This is the beginning of the fourth hour, but as Alex was leaving...
[03:00:55.948 --> 03:01:01.773]  I mentioned to him the fact that it is 6-6-16 and all the different things that are happening with this.
[03:01:01.813 --> 03:01:05.796]  And of course it's not just what's happening with the chip.
[03:01:05.877 --> 03:01:07.138]  Alex wanted to talk about that.
[03:01:07.158 --> 03:01:11.001]  But of course Alex, it's also Bilderberg is starting this week.
[03:01:11.021 --> 03:01:11.701]  We've got breaks.
[03:01:11.721 --> 03:01:12.902]  Everything is at the cusp.
[03:01:12.983 --> 03:01:16.746]  We've got world government that is breaking out or people trying to break out of it.
[03:01:17.006 --> 03:01:17.466]  Absolutely.
[03:01:17.486 --> 03:01:19.608]  The Pope's calling for world government, saying the Christian roots.
[03:01:20.048 --> 03:01:21.350]  He's ashamed of the Christian roots.
[03:01:21.370 --> 03:01:22.370]  He used a worse word.
[03:01:22.711 --> 03:01:24.152]  He abhors hearing about them.
[03:01:24.612 --> 03:01:25.414]  You know, it's terrible.
[03:01:25.474 --> 03:01:26.155]  He dreads.
[03:01:26.815 --> 03:01:28.017]  We can pull up that exact quote.
[03:01:28.077 --> 03:01:31.862]  So I'm going to get out of here in five minutes, but I was leaving to a meeting that I'm already late for.
[03:01:33.169 --> 03:01:38.192]  And you were like, yeah, 666, all this weird occult stuff going on, that's what I'm going to cover coming up, which you're going to do in a moment.
[03:01:38.592 --> 03:01:45.696]  And I went, oh my gosh, that's it, because I was on air Friday when this came out, and Saturday and Sunday, and I read this article from Infowars.com.
[03:01:45.716 --> 03:01:48.077]  Come on over here, Buckley, or maybe document cam in there.
[03:01:48.497 --> 03:01:53.880]  Why is there suddenly such a huge push for Mark of the Beast in technology?
[03:01:53.940 --> 03:01:57.642]  And there's just all over the news, suddenly, yes, you're going to have a chip.
[03:01:57.742 --> 03:01:58.823]  Yes, we're getting rid of cash.
[03:01:59.483 --> 03:02:00.424]  So what would you think?
[03:02:01.303 --> 03:02:03.405]  I got so excited about this, I'm even sweating all of a sudden.
[03:02:03.445 --> 03:02:04.966]  It's like 65 degrees in here.
[03:02:05.686 --> 03:02:06.687]  And it all clicked.
[03:02:06.967 --> 03:02:11.871]  These are their people pushing in the media and the system to throw it in our face, just like world government.
[03:02:12.131 --> 03:02:18.336]  We've seen more Mark of the Beast is good for you, get rid of cash, put a chip in your kids, in the last month that I've ever seen in 21 years on air.
[03:02:18.996 --> 03:02:20.617]  I mean, it has been a full onslaught.
[03:02:20.817 --> 03:02:22.758]  And the mystery is, it's 666.
[03:02:23.599 --> 03:02:24.299]  That's the day.
[03:02:24.920 --> 03:02:26.321]  It's June 6th.
[03:02:26.361 --> 03:02:28.342]  The month is 6, the day is 6, the year is 16.
[03:02:28.462 --> 03:02:30.263]  In numerology, the last number.
[03:02:30.703 --> 03:02:32.624]  That's why they're doing rituals everywhere.
[03:02:32.965 --> 03:02:34.746]  That's why they're launching... I bet they pull something today.
[03:02:34.766 --> 03:02:36.867]  I bet there's a mass killing or, you know, some big tragedy.
[03:02:37.427 --> 03:02:40.990]  They're doing all this garbage because they're bringing it in.
[03:02:41.330 --> 03:02:43.111]  Like, your mothers and fathers are bad.
[03:02:43.251 --> 03:02:44.292]  Jesus is bad.
[03:02:44.632 --> 03:02:45.853]  We abhor Christians.
[03:02:45.873 --> 03:02:47.814]  You know, bringing in the Muslims.
[03:02:48.574 --> 03:02:53.439]  And the EU proposing a ID to use the internet to tax it and track you and control you.
[03:02:53.779 --> 03:02:57.103]  Satanist plan to celebrate 6-6-16 in LA.
[03:02:57.923 --> 03:02:59.225]  This is their big coming out.
[03:02:59.625 --> 03:03:00.866]  This is their big push.
[03:03:01.307 --> 03:03:04.109]  And it ties into everything else we're facing, everything else we're seeing.
[03:03:04.330 --> 03:03:05.010]  I mean, undoubtedly.
[03:03:05.871 --> 03:03:06.492]  Just open.
[03:03:06.532 --> 03:03:07.733]  Your kid will get a chip.
[03:03:07.813 --> 03:03:08.334]  It's inevitable.
[03:03:08.374 --> 03:03:09.735]  We played that clip a week ago.
[03:03:10.115 --> 03:03:11.276]  Paul did a viral video on it.
[03:03:11.296 --> 03:03:12.618]  We can cue it up and play it in the next segment.
[03:03:12.918 --> 03:03:14.678]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[03:03:14.758 --> 03:03:16.259]  Your kid will get a chip.
[03:03:16.599 --> 03:03:17.119]  It's inevitable.
[03:03:17.379 --> 03:03:34.143]  If that isn't the mark of the beast, if a cashless society and parents being persecuted and being turned off the internet if you don't submit to the world government so you can't even have a job and it being digitally erased in an electronic concentration camp, if that isn't the mark of the beast, if the devil isn't real, they've taken the idea and they're doing it, David.
[03:03:34.363 --> 03:03:35.623]  They're manifesting it.
[03:03:36.064 --> 03:03:36.884]  Well, it's real to them.
[03:03:37.224 --> 03:03:39.584]  Or they wouldn't be putting a pentagram around L.A.
[03:03:39.904 --> 03:03:41.365]  today is when they're doing it in L.A.
[03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:43.821]  David, this is just incredible.
[03:03:43.861 --> 03:03:44.722]  Your thoughts for a minute.
[03:03:45.242 --> 03:03:46.303]  I've made my point here.
[03:03:46.323 --> 03:03:47.684]  Tell us what you've got coming up.
[03:03:48.044 --> 03:03:52.748]  One of the things we're going to cover, and we're going to cover it tonight on the Nightly News because there's a lot of visuals about it.
[03:03:53.348 --> 03:04:06.579]  There was also, Alex, on June the 1st, there was a grand opening ceremony for this massive rail tunnel through the Swiss mountains, the Goddard train, it's a railroad underground tunnel.
[03:04:07.139 --> 03:04:10.541]  But the ceremony, Alex, that they had was truly bizarre.
[03:04:10.561 --> 03:04:13.063]  It's one of the most bizarre, occultic ceremonies you'll see.
[03:04:13.083 --> 03:04:14.384]  So we're going to show clips of that.
[03:04:14.404 --> 03:04:18.687]  We're going to talk about what's behind that, as well as... Remember the all-seeing eye on the 9-11 event?
[03:04:18.727 --> 03:04:19.027]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:19.307 --> 03:04:19.547]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:19.848 --> 03:04:21.309]  Yeah, but this is really strange.
[03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:32.776]  I mean, people who've seen the movie done by Terry Gilliam, Brazil, the dream sequences, they've got this topless woman flying with feathers and this big baby head on.
[03:04:32.816 --> 03:04:35.498]  I mean, and they've got people marching around like they're in a trance.
[03:04:37.059 --> 03:04:37.880]  Totally bizarre.
[03:04:37.940 --> 03:04:40.262]  They admit that these things are big mass rituals.
[03:04:40.903 --> 03:04:42.544]  And that's how they program society.
[03:04:42.604 --> 03:04:43.565]  And they're doing it, folks.
[03:04:43.925 --> 03:04:45.727]  And most of these elites are totally mentally ill.
[03:04:46.027 --> 03:04:47.669]  That's why it doesn't make sense to a lot of us.
[03:04:48.209 --> 03:04:49.411]  David Knight, great job, folks.
[03:04:49.451 --> 03:04:51.853]  That is the mystery of all this Mark of the Beast promotion.
[03:04:52.193 --> 03:04:53.695]  It has to do with the 666 day.
[03:04:53.935 --> 03:04:54.796]  They're celebrating it.
[03:04:54.816 --> 03:04:55.958]  They're trying to bring it in.
[03:04:56.198 --> 03:04:57.820]  They're trying to bring in the Antichrist.
[03:04:58.060 --> 03:05:00.103]  They're trying to bring in the false new age.
[03:05:00.283 --> 03:05:04.689]  Because when Christ truly returns, that's when the true new age begins for a thousand years.
[03:05:04.909 --> 03:05:05.930]  There's a real Illuminati.
[03:05:06.010 --> 03:05:07.172]  That's just for freedom and openness.
[03:05:07.392 --> 03:05:08.493]  There's a false Illuminati.
[03:05:08.854 --> 03:05:09.515]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:10.345 --> 03:05:19.351]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:05:19.431 --> 03:05:27.497]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:05:27.817 --> 03:05:32.519]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:05:32.699 --> 03:05:39.421]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:05:39.501 --> 03:05:46.564]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:05:46.684 --> 03:05:53.526]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:05:53.686 --> 03:05:58.049]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:05:58.170 --> 03:06:01.432]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:06:01.572 --> 03:06:07.697]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:06:07.877 --> 03:06:10.039]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[03:06:10.259 --> 03:06:15.860]  Bilderberg 2016 is kicking off Thursday, June 9th, and InfoWars is already there to cover the event.
[03:06:16.100 --> 03:06:28.483]  This year, the Bilderberg Global Elite are meeting in Dresden, Germany, where they'll likely discuss how to stop the UK from leaving the EU, the growing resistance against the destruction of Western culture and a mass invasion of Muslim migrants, and the rise of Donald Trump.
[03:06:28.663 --> 03:06:34.065]  The mood at Bilderberg will be very grim, as both populism and nationalism rise up across the world to stop globalism.
[03:06:34.305 --> 03:06:39.126]  Europeans in particular are tired of having their lives controlled by the unelected bureaucracy known as the European Union.
[03:06:39.386 --> 03:06:43.727]  Which was based on Adolf Hitler's plan for a European super-state which eradicates national sovereignty.
[03:06:43.988 --> 03:06:49.489]  Bilderberg Group has been nurturing the EU to life since the 1950s, and now they see their despotic regime dying.
[03:06:49.729 --> 03:06:51.750]  Maybe it'll be a wake-up call for some of the elite.
[03:06:51.830 --> 03:06:54.491]  There's more to existence than simply controlling others.
[03:06:54.711 --> 03:07:00.153]  And humanity could explore the universe if individuals were left alone to brew innovations which advance the human race.
[03:07:00.373 --> 03:07:08.399]  Keep checking InfoWars.com and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube for the latest breaking developments on Bilderberg and the migrant crisis in Germany.
[03:07:08.519 --> 03:07:09.720]  This is Kent Daniels reporting.
[03:07:10.080 --> 03:07:11.921]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:07:11.981 --> 03:07:13.883]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:07:14.003 --> 03:07:16.865]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:07:16.905 --> 03:07:19.467]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals.
[03:07:19.727 --> 03:07:22.749]  This is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:07:22.949 --> 03:07:31.834]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:07:32.155 --> 03:07:39.359]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:07:39.659 --> 03:07:43.121]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:07:43.281 --> 03:07:49.565]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:07:49.885 --> 03:07:52.187]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:07:52.287 --> 03:07:54.708]  It's normally $220 plus.
[03:07:55.009 --> 03:08:00.552]  But right now, for a limited time, it's less than $200 at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:08:00.672 --> 03:08:03.234]  And the small profit we make goes to fund our reporters.
[03:08:03.354 --> 03:08:04.635]  This is a 360 win.
[03:08:04.835 --> 03:08:08.758]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:08:24.864 --> 03:08:26.925]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:27.486 --> 03:08:32.568]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:08:32.808 --> 03:08:40.853]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this 6-6-16.
[03:08:40.913 --> 03:08:45.255]  And as you just heard when Alex was in here, we were doing a Facebook mention live.
[03:08:45.295 --> 03:08:53.480]  We were talking about the significance, not just to Christians, but to the Satanists who are putting a pentagram around LA this day.
[03:08:54.020 --> 03:09:04.686]  And as we pointed out tonight, we're going to have a special report of the strange occultic rituals that surrounded the grand opening of a train tunnel through the Goddard Mountains in Switzerland.
[03:09:04.726 --> 03:09:06.367]  You will not believe the imagery of that.
[03:09:06.527 --> 03:09:08.969]  We're going to play a clip in honor of 6-6-16.
[03:09:08.989 --> 03:09:13.691]  We're going to play a short clip of a microchip report in just a minute.
[03:09:13.731 --> 03:09:14.312]  Before we do,
[03:09:15.072 --> 03:09:21.575]  I want to remind you that today is the last day that we have of 20% off of Lung Cleanse at Infowarslife.com.
[03:09:21.595 --> 03:09:25.758]  This is the final day to get 20% off Lung Cleanse at Infowarslife.com.
[03:09:26.258 --> 03:09:32.161]  This is something that I use to get my throat in condition if I've got a little bit of a cough or something or some dust.
[03:09:32.241 --> 03:09:34.182]  It's a great throat clear.
[03:09:34.462 --> 03:09:37.724]  It's a great way to cleanse your lung.
[03:09:37.804 --> 03:09:38.584]  We have that at 20% off and also
[03:09:40.605 --> 03:09:41.826]  We're talking about fresh air.
[03:09:41.866 --> 03:09:44.607]  We have a new product, Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:09:45.227 --> 03:09:47.388]  This is the final day of our introductory sale on that.
[03:09:47.408 --> 03:09:48.668]  25% off.
[03:09:48.688 --> 03:09:49.929]  That's a huge savings.
[03:09:49.949 --> 03:09:52.510]  $184.99 will be your net cost with that.
[03:09:53.430 --> 03:09:54.411]  25% off retail.
[03:09:54.551 --> 03:09:55.431]  It ends tonight.
[03:09:55.491 --> 03:09:56.912]  This is the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:09:57.292 --> 03:09:58.973]  It is an energy efficient HEPA filter.
[03:09:58.993 --> 03:09:59.933]  It's ion cluster.
[03:10:00.513 --> 03:10:08.922]  It cycles the air through your rooms to get at, basically takes out all the impurities and you're locked up tight as a drum house.
[03:10:09.002 --> 03:10:14.667]  Most of the houses are that way because you're trying to get it efficient for heating, for cooling, so you get everything tight for that.
[03:10:15.068 --> 03:10:19.152]  But then it keeps all the pollutants in your house circulating around.
[03:10:19.212 --> 03:10:20.473]  So you want to get that out of there.
[03:10:20.533 --> 03:10:22.035]  This is a great way to do it.
[03:10:22.981 --> 03:10:24.422]  It's very space-saving.
[03:10:24.522 --> 03:10:26.584]  It's perfect for rooms up to about 800 square feet.
[03:10:27.104 --> 03:10:28.145]  It's very silent.
[03:10:28.525 --> 03:10:30.667]  It is less than a whisper.
[03:10:30.687 --> 03:10:31.748]  A whisper is 30 dB.
[03:10:31.808 --> 03:10:33.469]  This is 16 dB.
[03:10:33.849 --> 03:10:37.792]  Very energy-efficient, and the end product is clean water.
[03:10:38.252 --> 03:10:40.194]  Check that out at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:10:40.234 --> 03:10:41.975]  We have an introductory offer of that.
[03:10:41.995 --> 03:10:50.601]  25% off the Alexa Pure Breeze, and today is the last day for that, as well as the 20% off Lung Cleanse, which you'll see at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:10:51.912 --> 03:11:02.077]  Okay, let's run that clip on the microchip report, because this is something, as Alex pointed out, there's been a lot of pushing of microchips, of a cashless society.
[03:11:02.717 --> 03:11:06.178]  This is the beginning of Bilderberg, which has been pushing world government.
[03:11:06.198 --> 03:11:09.220]  That's been the purpose of Bilderberg since its inception.
[03:11:09.240 --> 03:11:10.220]  We'll talk about that a little bit.
[03:11:10.240 --> 03:11:11.741]  We're also going to talk today about Brexit.
[03:11:11.761 --> 03:11:15.823]  We're going to talk about the push to confiscate land.
[03:11:16.643 --> 03:11:21.686]  This is another push by Obama, but even more interesting is the way the Washington Post is pushing it.
[03:11:21.706 --> 03:11:25.027]  But before we do all that news, let's play that clip on microchips.
[03:11:25.648 --> 03:11:30.010]  You know, chances are if you have a four-legged family member at home, it's already microchipped.
[03:11:30.450 --> 03:11:35.852]  And if the technology exists to save Fido in an emergency, what about microchipping your child?
[03:11:36.153 --> 03:11:40.715]  Before you say, no way, I would never do that, hear one mom's story.
[03:11:42.208 --> 03:11:47.312]  It's the longest two seconds of your life, and it's absolute panic.
[03:11:47.332 --> 03:11:49.113]  I want my son back!
[03:11:49.393 --> 03:11:51.214]  We've seen it in movies.
[03:11:51.494 --> 03:11:53.576]  This is my daughter!
[03:11:53.696 --> 03:11:56.838]  Over and over again, children gone missing.
[03:11:57.078 --> 03:11:58.159]  It's terrifying.
[03:11:58.179 --> 03:12:04.583]  For Stephanie Rodriguez Neely, life is busier than ever, with four children, including a newborn.
[03:12:04.603 --> 03:12:09.887]  She knows scary situations can happen in an instant, and for her, it has.
[03:12:10.207 --> 03:12:11.167]  If it'll save my kid,
[03:12:12.348 --> 03:12:13.309]  There's there's no stuff.
[03:12:13.329 --> 03:12:26.034]  That's too extreme Stephanie's teenage daughter is a special needs child prone to wander off and trust strangers for that very reason Stephanie wholeheartedly welcomes Microchipping isn't that special all right?
[03:12:26.054 --> 03:12:28.115]  We're gonna stop it at that point, and I would just say this
[03:12:29.039 --> 03:12:30.159]  You've got a special needs child.
[03:12:30.200 --> 03:12:32.781]  You're concerned the child is going to run off and get into trouble.
[03:12:33.021 --> 03:12:33.521]  Understand.
[03:12:34.101 --> 03:12:39.483]  Also understand the health consequences of putting those transmitters on your dogs even.
[03:12:39.504 --> 03:12:40.184]  Okay?
[03:12:40.204 --> 03:12:46.306]  There's been a lot of increase in terms of tumors at the sites where they put these radio transmitters into dogs.
[03:12:46.466 --> 03:12:47.627]  I wouldn't do it to my dog.
[03:12:48.267 --> 03:12:49.568]  And I wouldn't do it to my child.
[03:12:49.968 --> 03:12:53.469]  And I wouldn't do it to my elderly parent who suffers from dementia either.
[03:12:54.070 --> 03:12:55.510]  And I wouldn't do it to myself.
[03:12:55.550 --> 03:12:56.091]  Because you know what?
[03:12:57.111 --> 03:12:58.252]  It's not just the health issues.
[03:12:58.993 --> 03:13:01.815]  It is also the issues of freedom, folks.
[03:13:01.955 --> 03:13:07.159]  We cannot continue to sell ourselves into slavery for the promise of security.
[03:13:07.880 --> 03:13:08.661]  They never deliver it.
[03:13:09.568 --> 03:13:14.169]  They tell you, give up your freedom, we'll make you more prosperous, we'll make you safer.
[03:13:14.909 --> 03:13:16.449]  Slaves are never safer.
[03:13:16.969 --> 03:13:18.690]  Slaves never get richer.
[03:13:18.990 --> 03:13:20.110]  When are we going to learn that?
[03:13:20.390 --> 03:13:25.151]  When are we going to learn that to the degree that we give up our liberty, we become slaves?
[03:13:25.491 --> 03:13:32.452]  They continue to offer us this Faustian bargain, and we never realize that the devil's got a trick up his sleeve.
[03:13:32.512 --> 03:13:38.053]  No matter how many times they skunk us, they keep doing it to us, over and over again.
[03:13:38.553 --> 03:13:40.134]  And this is just another example of that.
[03:13:40.655 --> 03:13:42.456]  Putting this out there saying, well, it's great.
[03:13:42.516 --> 03:13:43.317]  It's for your dogs.
[03:13:43.357 --> 03:13:45.739]  It's for your special needs children.
[03:13:45.819 --> 03:13:49.282]  It's for your elderly people that we need to keep track of.
[03:13:49.362 --> 03:13:49.562]  No.
[03:13:50.303 --> 03:13:50.463]  No.
[03:13:51.443 --> 03:13:52.845]  There's an agenda behind this, folks.
[03:13:52.925 --> 03:13:54.746]  We've pointed that out many, many times.
[03:13:55.507 --> 03:13:55.767]  All right.
[03:13:55.847 --> 03:14:00.971]  Now, I've got a lot of disjointed news here that I just want to cover a little bit at a time.
[03:14:01.051 --> 03:14:04.074]  One of these things here is kind of, I think it's very interesting.
[03:14:05.208 --> 03:14:19.552]  As we look at the people that are being brought into this country by Obama, and I mentioned this briefly yesterday, how we've had situations in Vermont, and they reported that, hey look, 35% of the people coming into Vermont have tuberculosis.
[03:14:20.793 --> 03:14:27.755]  Many people in America don't really get concerned about that, because they've forgotten what tuberculosis is, because it only affects about 5% of the people here.
[03:14:29.076 --> 03:14:30.757]  But globally, the average is about 35%.
[03:14:31.237 --> 03:14:44.146]  And of the places where Obama is bringing people in without vetting them, without doing any health tests on them, in many of the Asian and African countries, it is up to 80% of the people who have tuberculosis.
[03:14:44.646 --> 03:14:45.687]  Remember they called it consumption?
[03:14:46.147 --> 03:14:51.711]  Maybe you want to go back and look at some of the old westerns where they got Doc Holliday and he's spitting up blood and dying.
[03:14:52.131 --> 03:14:53.052]  Because it will kill you.
[03:14:53.835 --> 03:14:56.216]  And you say, well, we got treatments for that in the first world.
[03:14:56.336 --> 03:15:02.278]  Well, yes, but there are also drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis as well.
[03:15:02.318 --> 03:15:03.578]  Do you want to bring that in here as well?
[03:15:04.539 --> 03:15:08.400]  This is a deliberate move by Obama in so many different ways.
[03:15:09.020 --> 03:15:11.841]  It seems like he is hell-bent on destroying this country.
[03:15:12.401 --> 03:15:16.462]  Destroying our way of life, destroying our health, and yet they keep offering us safety.
[03:15:16.502 --> 03:15:17.163]  Just take the chip.
[03:15:17.303 --> 03:15:17.883]  You'll be fine.
[03:15:18.683 --> 03:15:29.753]  But we're bringing in all these people who hate America, who want what you have, and in many cases who are coming in untested for disease, untested for being criminals, untested for being terrorists.
[03:15:30.474 --> 03:15:39.042]  And now we just saw this last weekend as it broke, we had workers in two Minnesota hospitals that were diagnosed with active TB.
[03:15:39.082 --> 03:15:40.864]  These are two workers, both
[03:15:41.344 --> 03:15:41.585]  We're good.
[03:15:55.339 --> 03:16:12.697]  Last year, a local newspaper reported three employees of another clinic owned by this same company within 10 miles of these two hospitals where the two workers were just diagnosed with active tuberculosis received awards from Anoka County, the fourth most populous county in the Minneapolis-St.
[03:16:12.737 --> 03:16:15.781]  Paul area, for their volunteer work medically screening
[03:16:16.441 --> 03:16:17.062]  Refugees.
[03:16:17.342 --> 03:16:17.522]  Yeah.
[03:16:17.702 --> 03:16:17.963]  Okay.
[03:16:18.343 --> 03:16:18.603]  Okay.
[03:16:18.843 --> 03:16:19.464]  So there you go.
[03:16:19.844 --> 03:16:23.468]  They tell you one thing, and they do another, and that's a report from Breitbart.
[03:16:23.868 --> 03:16:25.529]  But I want to focus on something else.
[03:16:26.711 --> 03:16:36.519]  And that is, what if our government, as they bring in these refugees that don't screen them, we know that they are bringing in diseases to be used as weapons, as bioweapons.
[03:16:37.340 --> 03:16:38.962]  They call them select agents.
[03:16:40.092 --> 03:16:45.576]  And they try to give them what they call, in Pentagon talk, gain of function.
[03:16:46.036 --> 03:16:50.779]  That means that they make them more deadly, and that means that they make them more easily transmittable.
[03:16:51.680 --> 03:16:58.765]  And these are the kinds of research that are being performed by the Center for Disease Control, the CDC, and other biolab companies.
[03:16:59.265 --> 03:17:03.107]  Now there's a reporter at USA Today, Allison Young, and she's done a lot of work
[03:17:04.168 --> 03:17:13.299]  Following this, this is her beat, and she does a lot of work talking about the biolab failures of the CDC, and she just had one that broke at the end of the week.
[03:17:13.779 --> 03:17:20.727]  And I want to read you a little bit of this scenario, just to get you the idea of how dangerous this is.
[03:17:22.469 --> 03:17:29.053]  The title is newly disclosed CDC bio lab failures are quote like a screenplay for a disaster movie.
[03:17:29.073 --> 03:17:31.674]  And listen to this, it does read like a disaster movie.
[03:17:32.134 --> 03:17:47.843]  Encased in space suit like gear, needed to protect them from the world's deadliest viruses, four scientists at the CDC stepped into their labs decontamination chamber where a shower of chemicals was supposed to kill anything on them and make it safe for them to exit into an adjacent changing room.
[03:17:47.883 --> 03:17:49.424]  But the shower wouldn't start.
[03:17:50.005 --> 03:17:59.121]  And warning lights appeared as a cascading series of safety systems began to fail inside one of the world's most advanced biosafety level 4 labs.
[03:17:59.141 --> 03:18:00.223]  That's the highest level, folks.
[03:18:01.501 --> 03:18:03.622]  She goes on to say that in the next sentence.
[03:18:03.782 --> 03:18:10.865]  Reserved for work with deadly Ebola and smallpox viruses and other pathogens that lack vaccines or reliable treatments.
[03:18:11.365 --> 03:18:17.587]  The gasket seal around the exit door in the changing room deflated to the point that the scientists could see light coming in.
[03:18:18.148 --> 03:18:25.070]  See, there's a positive pressure, so they have no air escaping from this thing, but the gasket seal just broke down.
[03:18:25.110 --> 03:18:28.772]  So they could see light coming in through this seal that is supposed to be airtight.
[03:18:29.372 --> 03:18:34.355]  As they held the door shut and they started an emergency chemical deluge, things got even worse.
[03:18:34.795 --> 03:18:42.379]  The shower's door back into the infectious disease lab forcefully burst open again and again and they couldn't even hold it shut.
[03:18:42.459 --> 03:18:53.866]  Meanwhile, air pressure alarms were blinking and monitors displayed as the lab as read according to records of the February 2009 incident recently obtained by USA Today under a FOIA request.
[03:18:54.386 --> 03:18:58.212]  The CDC took three and a half years to fulfill the request.
[03:18:58.292 --> 03:18:58.593]  Why?
[03:18:58.913 --> 03:19:00.736]  Because they don't want you to know...
[03:19:02.082 --> 03:19:05.023]  What a cuck this whole thing is.
[03:19:05.523 --> 03:19:12.125]  They bring these things in, deadly diseases that don't even exist in our country, they're bringing them in as weapons.
[03:19:12.745 --> 03:19:16.586]  They're creating these weapons and they can't and won't control these things.
[03:19:16.846 --> 03:19:18.267]  You need to be very concerned about this.
[03:19:18.327 --> 03:19:19.927]  What do we do to stop this?
[03:19:19.967 --> 03:19:20.868]  How do we get control of this?
[03:19:21.128 --> 03:19:23.148]  This is the CDC's own lab.
[03:19:23.729 --> 03:19:27.750]  And of course the same reporter reported on what happened in the Primate Center.
[03:19:28.897 --> 03:19:44.373]  About a year and a half ago, the National Primate Center, where they brought in a disease that's not endemic to the United States, a very deadly disease, they brought it in to make it more deadly, more easy to catch, and somehow it got out of a bio-level safety lab level number three.
[03:19:44.933 --> 03:19:49.096]  It got into the primates who were not even contained in a contained area.
[03:19:49.416 --> 03:19:52.338]  What you have to be concerned about is it getting into the soil and water.
[03:19:52.738 --> 03:19:55.821]  And then as they investigated it, they found workers who came down with it.
[03:19:55.841 --> 03:20:00.464]  But they said, don't worry, I'm sure those workers already had it before they started the investigation.
[03:20:00.844 --> 03:20:02.345]  That's the way they lied to us.
[03:20:02.385 --> 03:20:04.727]  You have to understand how dangerous this is.
[03:20:04.787 --> 03:20:08.409]  They are playing not only with fire, they're playing with a pandemic.
[03:20:08.549 --> 03:20:08.829]  Stay with us.
[03:20:08.849 --> 03:20:09.410]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:10.987 --> 03:20:23.674]  This message is not just addressed to my fellow Americans, but addressed to people across the world of every race, color, and creed who believe in free speech, enshrined here in our republic as the First Amendment.
[03:20:24.354 --> 03:20:27.756]  It's the First Amendment to the Bill of Rights because it is the most important.
[03:20:27.776 --> 03:20:32.539]  The right to speak, the right to publish, the right to assemble, the right to petition, the right to
[03:20:32.799 --> 03:20:36.700]  Practice your own religion and not having a state-run or authorized system.
[03:20:36.900 --> 03:20:46.182]  We have seen Facebook, Google, Twitter and other media platforms increasingly censor even mainline libertarian and conservative ideas.
[03:20:46.462 --> 03:20:58.004]  Ladies and gentlemen, Facebook, if it's able to successfully get away with censoring a wide spectrum of ideas that the establishment doesn't agree with, not just conservatives, will set a mega-massive precedent.
[03:20:58.504 --> 03:20:59.985]  Facebook's over a third of the internet.
[03:21:00.065 --> 03:21:00.706]  Did you think about that?
[03:21:01.206 --> 03:21:02.668]  Of the traffic and people visiting things.
[03:21:03.068 --> 03:21:03.668]  And then it's over.
[03:21:03.989 --> 03:21:08.292]  You think it's bad that Communist China, with a billion, three hundred million people, is censoring?
[03:21:09.133 --> 03:21:16.379]  Zuckerberg, who calls his users dumb effers, has been meeting with the Chinese censorship leadership, openly trying to tweak it.
[03:21:16.499 --> 03:21:21.423]  He met with Merkel, and openly, in a hot mic, said, don't worry, I'm gonna start suppressing and censoring people.
[03:21:21.583 --> 03:21:26.027]  They report when someone criticizes open borders to the German government, and they come and arrest you.
[03:21:26.207 --> 03:21:27.008]  This is a global
[03:21:27.668 --> 03:21:27.828]  That's
[03:21:44.889 --> 03:21:47.651]  First of all, this is the ultimate threat to humanity.
[03:21:48.051 --> 03:21:50.212]  This is worse than what we saw in the Soviet Union.
[03:21:50.632 --> 03:21:54.414]  This is right out of Nazi Germany or right out of Maoist China.
[03:21:54.834 --> 03:21:56.155]  So we're fighting for free speech.
[03:21:56.495 --> 03:22:06.581]  When you spread the word about Infowars.com, our videos, our stories, our reports, and when you post it on different platforms, that circumvents their AI systems that are trying to restrict the flow of information.
[03:22:06.701 --> 03:22:08.602]  We stand together or we hang separate.
[03:22:08.842 --> 03:22:13.685]  Another thing we're doing is not just battling to stop the censorship, we're also building other platforms.
[03:22:14.125 --> 03:22:21.930]  Getting on as many third party systems as there are out there and spreading the word of basic free market liberty and human empowerment and the new renaissance.
[03:22:22.430 --> 03:22:25.692]  But also, the experts I've talked to said, Alex, you missed the boat.
[03:22:25.732 --> 03:22:29.214]  You've been a pioneer in many ways, but you haven't promoted email.
[03:22:29.314 --> 03:22:31.395]  And I said, yeah, I don't ever really market on email.
[03:22:31.495 --> 03:22:33.316]  I just, I just, it's low tech.
[03:22:33.496 --> 03:22:34.297]  And they're like, no, no, no.
[03:22:34.337 --> 03:22:35.818]  That's what's going to be hard to censor.
[03:22:35.878 --> 03:22:42.502]  Even if the internet kill switch comes into place, there are systems and there are developments that make it very hard still.
[03:22:43.482 --> 03:22:49.006]  To stop email and to stop that information being sent over networks, you name it.
[03:22:49.066 --> 03:22:50.487]  So it's essential.
[03:22:51.443 --> 03:23:02.693]  That everybody go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter to get exclusive articles, videos, promo codes, sometimes the shopping cart like we had a few weeks ago with Hillary for prison, 50% off.
[03:23:03.013 --> 03:23:07.837]  I mean, there are some big discounts we send to incentivize people and pleasure some of those hardcore patriots.
[03:23:08.157 --> 03:23:12.501]  You can send the email and the newsletter on with exclusive videos and articles many days.
[03:23:13.142 --> 03:23:14.103]  So that's another great reason.
[03:23:14.123 --> 03:23:17.746]  But overall, it's so that we have direct contact
[03:23:18.266 --> 03:23:32.231]  With fellow patriots out there around the world, and if they try to start shutting our websites down and other things, which they've tried to do, and kick us off Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, you name it, we'll be able to send you direct videos that you can then send on to others.
[03:23:32.251 --> 03:23:40.814]  We've all got to start thinking about the censorship and actively fighting it, getting more active and not taking independent, liberty-based media for granted, which I know you don't do.
[03:23:42.034 --> 03:23:52.181]  But really having a sense of urgency and getting the info out more while building new avenues on cutting-edge tech and cutting-edge platforms, but also old tech like email.
[03:23:52.422 --> 03:23:59.827]  So please join hundreds of thousands of others that have been signing up every few months at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:24:00.187 --> 03:24:09.294]  And you can also spread the word about our free feeds and more podcasts, Android apps, iPhone apps, it's all free at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:24:18.081 --> 03:24:19.383]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:19.424 --> 03:24:28.540]  I'm David Knight, and we were just talking in the last segment about the latest revelation, because we've had revelations before about breakdowns in biosafety labs.
[03:24:29.335 --> 03:24:34.018]  Of course, we've had the government shipping live anthrax virus through the regular mail.
[03:24:34.719 --> 03:24:37.380]  We've had the National Primate Center.
[03:24:37.440 --> 03:24:41.043]  We've had deadly bacteria get out and escape into the wild there.
[03:24:41.083 --> 03:24:43.104]  They don't know, still don't know how that happened.
[03:24:43.584 --> 03:24:51.589]  I just read you this report, they said, and it does play like the screenplay of a disaster movie, because this is a disaster waiting to happen.
[03:24:51.609 --> 03:24:53.551]  And this is just the incompetence level here.
[03:24:54.051 --> 03:24:59.834]  This isn't even talking about the sinister stuff that they do, like the Tuskegee experiments that we all know about.
[03:25:00.634 --> 03:25:03.795]  But the very fact that they're doing this is sinister.
[03:25:04.235 --> 03:25:16.681]  The very fact that we have, with Operation Paperclip, that we brought in these Nazi and Japanese scientists who had been doing horrific human experimentation and brought them in for our own weapons program.
[03:25:17.461 --> 03:25:25.687]  To give these deadly non-native diseases again a function, to make them more deadly, to make them more easily transmittable.
[03:25:26.228 --> 03:25:30.291]  So, that's one of the things that's facing us, and of course the breakouts of this.
[03:25:30.351 --> 03:25:31.832]  How do we contain government?
[03:25:32.112 --> 03:25:34.034]  It's a perfect metaphor for government, isn't it?
[03:25:34.474 --> 03:25:37.996]  Especially the government, the national security state, the Pentagon.
[03:25:38.939 --> 03:25:43.682]  How they create these weapons that are hanging over our heads like the sword of Damocles.
[03:25:44.323 --> 03:25:46.084]  And yet there's other problems as well.
[03:25:46.284 --> 03:25:51.728]  At the same time they're doing this and telling us that they have to have a national security state to watch everything that everybody does.
[03:25:52.389 --> 03:25:56.912]  We see that the federal government lost all of its personnel records to hackers.
[03:25:57.352 --> 03:25:58.033]  And now this.
[03:25:58.613 --> 03:26:00.655]  Coming out of, interestingly enough, Australia.
[03:26:01.075 --> 03:26:07.101]  I had a guy send this to me on Twitter because you know our press doesn't cover this kind of news but Australia did.
[03:26:07.141 --> 03:26:10.364]  The US Federal Reserve was breached more than 50 times recently.
[03:26:10.384 --> 03:26:11.765]  The US Federal Reserve.
[03:26:12.847 --> 03:26:21.790]  Detected more than 50 breaches to its network and systems between 2011 and 2015 with several incidents described internally as espionage.
[03:26:22.170 --> 03:26:25.472]  They say the Fed's computer systems play a critical role in global banking.
[03:26:25.492 --> 03:26:32.554]  Of course, they hold confidential information on discussions about monetary policy that drives financial markets.
[03:26:32.594 --> 03:26:42.058]  Of course, we're having that kind of discussion today as Janet Yellen is dropping hints about whether she's going to raise interest rates or not, doing it at the same time people are talking about Brexit.
[03:26:42.578 --> 03:26:50.721]  And we've got the Prime Minister of the UK trying to scare people about financial Armageddon if they leave the EU.
[03:26:50.881 --> 03:26:52.862]  And we're going to cover that in the next segment here.
[03:26:52.882 --> 03:27:01.425]  But with this, they say the cyber security reports obtained by Reuters, again through a FOIA act, were heavily redacted by the Fed officials.
[03:27:01.465 --> 03:27:10.628]  They say the records represent only a slice of all cyber attacks on the Fed because they include only cases involving the Washington-based Board of Governors.
[03:27:11.388 --> 03:27:17.813]  They did not have access to reports of cyber security teams at the central bank's 12 privately owned regional branches.
[03:27:18.193 --> 03:27:24.337]  Disclosure breaches of the Fed comes at a time when cyber security at central banks worldwide is under scrutiny and under attack.
[03:27:24.998 --> 03:27:31.322]  After hackers stole 81 million dollars from a bank Bangladesh account at the New York Fed.
[03:27:31.683 --> 03:27:32.903]  At the New York Fed.
[03:27:33.184 --> 03:27:34.985]  They went into the New York Fed.
[03:27:35.685 --> 03:27:38.788]  This is bigger than Bonnie and Clyde.
[03:27:38.828 --> 03:27:40.390]  This is bigger than Jesse James.
[03:27:40.450 --> 03:27:42.852]  This is bigger than the Italian job.
[03:27:42.872 --> 03:27:47.336]  You know where they had those little minis and they went in and robbed the bank and they had little cars so they could get through the traffic jams.
[03:27:47.376 --> 03:27:53.161]  Now, they didn't do any of that physical stuff because of the digital cash.
[03:27:54.264 --> 03:28:00.130]  Hackers can go in and steal 81 million dollars, and they can do it at the New York Fed.
[03:28:00.791 --> 03:28:03.253]  Just hack into their account and take it right out of there.
[03:28:03.273 --> 03:28:08.799]  They say cyber thieves have targeted large financial institutions around the world, including America's largest bank, J.P.
[03:28:08.819 --> 03:28:14.825]  Morgan, as well as smaller players like Ecuador's Banco del Ostro and Vietnam's Tien Phong Bank.
[03:28:15.546 --> 03:28:20.295]  They also go on to say security analysts said foreign governments could stand to gain from internal Fed information.
[03:28:20.335 --> 03:28:20.716]  You think?
[03:28:20.976 --> 03:28:21.317]  You think?
[03:28:21.617 --> 03:28:22.639]  You think they could use that?
[03:28:22.839 --> 03:28:24.823]  You think China and Russia, as I say, for instance?
[03:28:25.583 --> 03:28:36.186]  Major players in the $13.8 trillion federal debt market, where Fed policy plays a big role in setting interest rates.
[03:28:36.226 --> 03:28:49.611]  So, if you are a criminal individual, or if you are a foreign government that wants to mess with our money supply, then you go to the people who are counterfeiting it, the Federal Reserve, and they're talking about whether they're going to pump or dump
[03:28:50.475 --> 03:28:58.416]  Whether they're going to do quantitative easing, are they going to raise or lower interest rates, having that advanced knowledge can get you a lot of money.
[03:28:59.375 --> 03:29:02.857]  And it makes them a big target, and they're not doing a very good job of protecting it.
[03:29:02.877 --> 03:29:15.362]  But of course, if you're a congressman or a congresswoman, then you can act on inside information that you have when you're going to pass bills to help a particular company or to shut down a particular industry.
[03:29:15.382 --> 03:29:18.163]  You can sell it short if you're going to shut down the coal industry.
[03:29:18.363 --> 03:29:22.305]  You can make a lot of money selling short coal stocks or oil stocks.
[03:29:22.805 --> 03:29:29.412]  Or, if you're going to give a massive subsidy to a solar power company, it might be kind of convenient to have that information.
[03:29:29.432 --> 03:29:37.900]  And remember, that came out at one point in time, and everybody was appalled that Congress just looked the other way and said, no, that's okay, we can do insider training.
[03:29:38.280 --> 03:29:41.463]  We'll lock up Martha Stewart for it, but we will do it ourselves.
[03:29:42.324 --> 03:29:50.268]  So they passed a little bill, they left it in there for about six months, and when nobody was looking, they eviscerated that bill, they got rid of it, they're still doing insider trading.
[03:29:50.308 --> 03:29:53.510]  So why wouldn't cyber criminals do insider trading at the Federal Reserve?
[03:29:53.530 --> 03:29:54.531]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:29:59.393 --> 03:30:02.395]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.335 --> 03:30:06.017]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.808 --> 03:30:12.190]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:30:12.470 --> 03:30:13.752]  You can't survive without it.
[03:30:13.953 --> 03:30:14.854]  But where do you get it?

[03:30:46.796 --> 03:30:47.996]  Stainless steel construction.

[03:31:13.721 --> 03:31:23.330]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by Infowarslife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[03:32:11.365 --> 03:32:17.690]  I got so busy fighting the Globals for 15 years, I turned into a giant fat slob when I was an exercise fanatic before.
[03:32:18.090 --> 03:32:21.192]  Now, in the last five years, I set out to try to get back in shape.
[03:32:21.613 --> 03:32:33.462]  And to help turbocharge that, I talked to top scientists and nutraceutical developers and said, I want something that blocks these estrogen mimickers, something that helps me get back to what a real male was like instead of this Globals bombardment.
[03:32:34.042 --> 03:32:36.823]  We developed Super Male and Super Female Vitality.

[03:33:07.834 --> 03:33:13.638]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[03:33:14.598 --> 03:33:19.722]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[03:33:19.782 --> 03:33:25.806]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[03:33:25.826 --> 03:33:28.908]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.580 --> 03:33:35.085]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:35.125 --> 03:33:38.510]  I'm David Knight, your host on this 6-6-16.
[03:33:39.251 --> 03:33:48.483]  As we pointed out, we've had a couple of reports we did at the top of the hour with Alex Jones about the significance of what is happening in the world, what is being pushed in terms of
[03:33:49.083 --> 03:33:52.687]  We're going to have more on that tonight on the Infowars Nightly News.
[03:33:52.707 --> 03:33:55.870]  Tonight we're also going to talk about the billionaire's ultimate bug-out bag.
[03:34:07.961 --> 03:34:09.943]  And that would be a rocket ship, folks.
[03:34:10.063 --> 03:34:17.510]  You know, you talk about these billionaires building these elaborate places with panic rooms.
[03:34:17.630 --> 03:34:19.332]  George Clooney's got one in the UK.
[03:34:19.632 --> 03:34:27.140]  Other people setting up these elaborate and expensive compounds to protect themselves from some kind of a societal breakdown.
[03:34:27.180 --> 03:34:27.360]  Look.
[03:34:28.120 --> 03:34:36.589]  The ultimate bug-out bag is a rocket to get off of the place once their disruptive technologies get so disruptive that they start destroying the Earth.
[03:34:36.970 --> 03:34:40.974]  And we've had multiple science fiction scenarios, but of course we've had scientists that we've interviewed.
[03:34:41.014 --> 03:34:43.196]  I've interviewed Hugo deGarris who wrote The Artelect War.
[03:34:43.837 --> 03:34:44.498]  They talked about
[03:34:45.353 --> 03:34:52.417]  As people become, as the general public becomes aware of the danger of some of these technologies that are so dangerous.
[03:34:52.457 --> 03:34:58.200]  And we're not talking now about things like the gain-of-function bioweapon programs.
[03:34:58.240 --> 03:34:59.461]  That's one of them as well.
[03:34:59.501 --> 03:35:02.602]  But also the autonomous killing robots that are being done by the Pentagon.
[03:35:03.143 --> 03:35:05.024]  Even just artificial intelligence.
[03:35:05.304 --> 03:35:07.645]  Hugo de Garris is an artificial intelligence scientist.
[03:35:08.206 --> 03:35:10.026]  He talked about his concern
[03:35:11.087 --> 03:35:16.553]  That what he was creating, and his fellow scientists were creating, was going to get out of control.
[03:35:17.053 --> 03:35:18.415]  And that it would squash us.
[03:35:18.455 --> 03:35:21.297]  The same sorts of things that Elon Musk has openly talked about.
[03:35:21.317 --> 03:35:22.999]  And of course, that's his bug out bag.
[03:35:23.019 --> 03:35:24.160]  Trying to get to Mars.
[03:35:24.781 --> 03:35:25.922]  Setting up his space program.
[03:35:25.962 --> 03:35:27.143]  Tonight we're going to talk about...
[03:35:28.154 --> 03:35:30.455]  All these different billionaires and their different programs.
[03:35:30.495 --> 03:35:34.996]  I think the key guy that we need to look at is Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com.
[03:35:35.036 --> 03:35:37.197]  We're going to tell you what he's got going.
[03:35:37.237 --> 03:35:42.099]  I think he's the guy that's got the most interesting approach to all of this.
[03:35:43.246 --> 03:35:47.250]  And certainly I think he has the most advanced technology behind all this.
[03:35:47.270 --> 03:35:55.378]  We're going to talk about the other aspect of space exploration, and that is kind of a super Agenda 21, if you will.
[03:35:56.059 --> 03:36:07.650]  And of course, Agenda 21, the UN agenda for the 21st century, which says, let's lock all the people up in little tiny concentrated cities, and let's keep the rest of the world for the elites.
[03:36:07.990 --> 03:36:11.774]  Okay, that's now been changed and updated into something that's a little bit more specific.
[03:36:11.834 --> 03:36:13.035]  Not just the 21st century.
[03:36:13.075 --> 03:36:15.697]  No, they've got the 2030 UN Agenda.
[03:36:16.558 --> 03:36:19.360]  The 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development.
[03:36:20.041 --> 03:36:25.286]  So we're going to talk about that and how, I believe, this space exploration plays into all that.
[03:36:25.306 --> 03:36:27.648]  That's also going to be on tonight's nightly news.
[03:36:28.409 --> 03:36:32.853]  Before we get back to the news, I just want to remind you that today is the last day for two specials.

[03:36:45.026 --> 03:36:45.606]  It tastes great.
[03:36:45.826 --> 03:36:46.447]  It really works.
[03:36:46.507 --> 03:36:48.890]  It helps to cleanse your lungs.
[03:36:49.070 --> 03:36:53.074]  I use that to get my lungs cleansed when I get on the air.
[03:36:54.015 --> 03:36:59.239]  And BrainForce are two of my favorite supplements that we have at InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:37:15.493 --> 03:37:16.774]  25% off.

[03:37:23.973 --> 03:37:26.575]  I think you'll agree this is an incredible price.
[03:37:26.635 --> 03:37:30.878]  Again, this is something that recycles 120 cubic feet every 12 minutes.

[03:37:32.419 --> 03:37:37.743]  It's very silent and its byproduct is simply clean water.

[03:37:43.787 --> 03:37:46.368]  We have a comparison with other similar products.
[03:37:46.388 --> 03:37:48.549]  You can see what a savings that is on that.
[03:37:48.629 --> 03:37:57.312]  And again, today is the final day of that 25% off that introductory sale and the final day of 20% off of lung cleanse at Infowarslife.com.
[03:37:58.916 --> 03:38:00.178]  Let me see, where do I want to go?
[03:38:00.198 --> 03:38:03.603]  I think I want to talk about the misinformation that we're seeing.
[03:38:04.324 --> 03:38:11.535]  As I was driving in today, I heard yet again the narrative that Donald Trump has jumped the shark.
[03:38:11.675 --> 03:38:12.716]  How many times have we heard this?
[03:38:13.789 --> 03:38:22.514]  Because he criticized this judge who's doing very unjudicial things, by the way, in terms of releasing these transcripts as the trial is going on.
[03:38:23.234 --> 03:38:24.895]  Isn't that interesting that he would do that?
[03:38:24.935 --> 03:38:26.476]  But of course, there's no criticism for that.
[03:38:26.496 --> 03:38:32.098]  It's criticism for Donald Trump pointing out that this guy is biased and pointing out the reason for his bias.
[03:38:32.359 --> 03:38:33.979]  And he talks about his Mexican heritage.
[03:38:34.700 --> 03:38:38.662]  Now, Donald Trump was not saying that he can't get a fair trial from any Mexican, I don't think.
[03:38:38.702 --> 03:38:42.464]  But certainly this judge is somebody who bears looking at.
[03:38:43.112 --> 03:38:52.535]  Not simply because he has a Mexican heritage, but because his Mexican heritage is so important to him that he joins, that he's a key member of La Raza.
[03:38:53.675 --> 03:39:02.278]  Now, if you don't understand what La Raza is, let me read to you, and I read this yesterday on the Sunday Show, but I want to read this again because it bears repeating.
[03:39:02.698 --> 03:39:09.280]  This is Cesar Chavez, the union organizer for the United Farm Workers, okay, helping migrant workers.
[03:39:10.376 --> 03:39:14.581]  And he was very, very critical of La Raza, the race.
[03:39:16.363 --> 03:39:20.147]  Cesar Chavez said it was racist, the organization was racist.
[03:39:20.167 --> 03:39:24.371]  Here's specifically what he had to say, and you can see this on Wikipedia, you can see the quotes there.
[03:39:24.411 --> 03:39:30.758]  He says, I hear more and more Mexicans talking about La Raza, says Cesar Chavez, to build up their pride.
[03:39:31.679 --> 03:39:37.887]  Some people don't look at it as racism, but when you say La Raza, you are saying an anti-gringo thing and it won't stop there.
[03:39:38.367 --> 03:39:43.453]  Today it's anti-group, tomorrow it will be anti-gringo, tomorrow it will be anti-negro.
[03:39:44.134 --> 03:39:47.818]  We had a stupid guy who just wanted to play politics within the union.
[03:39:48.419 --> 03:39:51.700]  And he began to whip up La Raza against the white volunteers.
[03:39:52.260 --> 03:39:56.582]  And even had some of the farm workers and the pickets and the organizers hung up on La Raza.
[03:39:56.622 --> 03:39:57.322]  So I took him on.
[03:39:57.822 --> 03:39:59.403]  He said, these things have to be met on.
[03:40:00.003 --> 03:40:03.224]  On discrimination, I don't even give the members the privilege of a vote.
[03:40:03.604 --> 03:40:04.785]  And I'm not ashamed to say it.
[03:40:04.845 --> 03:40:08.366]  No, the whole business of discrimination can't exist here.
[03:40:08.966 --> 03:40:10.947]  So often these days, leaders are afraid.
[03:40:11.647 --> 03:40:15.589]  They even feel strongly about racism, but they won't speak out against it.
[03:40:16.636 --> 03:40:18.517]  It's important that we call it what it is.
[03:40:18.557 --> 03:40:28.360]  That's why we had the videos up saying that this judge is a key member of Hispanic, they called him Hispanic Grand Dragon.
[03:40:28.380 --> 03:40:30.581]  You need to understand, that's the case.
[03:40:30.901 --> 03:40:32.061]  Now let me read you something else here.
[03:40:32.081 --> 03:40:38.663]  You have a friend of his, Richard Garcia, who quoted Chavez, who said, La Raza, why be racist?
[03:40:38.763 --> 03:40:41.064]  Because La Raza literally means the race.
[03:40:41.384 --> 03:40:43.545]  He says, our belief is to help everyone.
[03:40:44.085 --> 03:40:45.025]  Not just one race.
[03:40:45.606 --> 03:40:47.346]  Humanity is our belief, he said.
[03:40:47.947 --> 03:40:56.950]  And a friend, another friend, Stan Steiner, observed that when Chavez told Chicanos this, he said, their faces fell in disbelief.
[03:40:57.511 --> 03:41:00.232]  They thought that he was a nationalist, not a humanist.
[03:41:02.225 --> 03:41:04.026]  That is what this is about, folks.
[03:41:04.906 --> 03:41:07.687]  This is a clash of nationalism.
[03:41:08.207 --> 03:41:13.889]  See, at the top level, what the Wall Street people are doing is a clash of globalism versus nationalism.
[03:41:14.569 --> 03:41:27.214]  But at the level that we're seeing with these Dreamer riots that are happening at the Trump rallies, where these people are waving Mexican flags and burning American flags, that is nationalism versus nationalism.
[03:41:28.379 --> 03:41:30.160]  That is what is behind all of this.
[03:41:30.400 --> 03:41:43.224]  And when you've got a judge who is a La Raza official, okay, highly connected in that, and then of course the Washington Post says, no, no, no, the La Raza lawyers is not connected to La Raza National.
[03:41:43.324 --> 03:41:44.284]  It's like baloney.
[03:41:44.684 --> 03:41:45.145]  Baloney.
[03:41:45.645 --> 03:41:46.805]  Just call them on that BS.
[03:41:46.845 --> 03:41:48.586]  I tell you what, Washington Post
[03:41:49.485 --> 03:41:53.969]  Has dropped to the lowest standards of just about any of the major newspapers.
[03:41:53.989 --> 03:41:58.132]  And of course, you know, we've pointed out a lot of problems with mainstream media.
[03:41:58.512 --> 03:42:03.156]  But Washington Post is getting to be a true propaganda rag.
[03:42:03.176 --> 03:42:05.358]  And I've got another example of that coming up here in just a moment.
[03:42:05.918 --> 03:42:09.762]  But when we see what's happening here, this is nationalism versus nationalism.
[03:42:09.802 --> 03:42:13.665]  These are people coming here saying, make America Mexican again.
[03:42:14.735 --> 03:42:24.960]  They're burning American flags, they're waving Mexican flags, they're hunting people down like prey because they are pro-American, or because they don't like their political beliefs.
[03:42:25.100 --> 03:42:25.960]  You're going to accept that?
[03:42:26.241 --> 03:42:30.283]  Are you going to accept the idea that we ought to just allow this to happen?
[03:42:30.303 --> 03:42:32.304]  We ought to just bring people in without any kind of vetting?
[03:42:32.324 --> 03:42:34.004]  And we ought to let everyone come here?
[03:42:34.144 --> 03:42:34.825]  Look at this story.
[03:42:35.788 --> 03:42:36.408]  I hadn't seen this.
[03:42:36.469 --> 03:42:37.349]  My wife sent this to me.
[03:42:37.749 --> 03:42:43.393]  Out of Fox, Atlanta, a woman in a burka attacks a Lawrenceville family who had an American flag.
[03:42:44.034 --> 03:42:45.475]  She attacked them with her own flag.
[03:42:46.055 --> 03:42:48.256]  They said they were sitting there and they're staying there in the garage.
[03:42:48.637 --> 03:42:50.238]  The lady said, I was talking to my daughter.
[03:42:50.258 --> 03:42:54.260]  And all of a sudden, this woman in a burka comes out of the woods.
[03:42:55.121 --> 03:42:56.762]  And she stands there and looks at us for a second.
[03:42:57.342 --> 03:43:01.585]  And then she goes over and they had an American flag on a pole stuck on their mailbox.
[03:43:02.406 --> 03:43:05.468]  She grabs the American flag that's on the pole and rushes them.
[03:43:06.212 --> 03:43:06.813]  To attack them.
[03:43:07.453 --> 03:43:13.578]  And as the daughter says, well, when she came charging it was kind of like mama bear instincts kicked in.
[03:43:14.299 --> 03:43:18.582]  My mama had to protect her children, so they got into a fight, these two women.
[03:43:19.063 --> 03:43:20.784]  And then some neighbors came over and helped them.
[03:43:20.824 --> 03:43:28.250]  When the police arrested this woman who gave her name as Amina Ara, 30, all she would tell them is she's quote, from Africa.
[03:43:29.153 --> 03:43:30.534]  No other information.
[03:43:30.574 --> 03:43:31.754]  Not even what country she's from.
[03:43:32.155 --> 03:43:32.875]  No local address.
[03:43:32.895 --> 03:43:34.936]  Because, you know, we don't vet anybody who comes here.
[03:43:35.356 --> 03:43:38.438]  We bring in people who hate this country.
[03:43:38.698 --> 03:43:44.000]  Or, as I mentioned yesterday, and this is another thing I want to repeat again, because I think this is very, very important.
[03:43:44.781 --> 03:43:46.902]  We had Hillary Clinton going through California.
[03:43:47.827 --> 03:43:50.568]  Doing her campaign stops, and of course she doesn't do press conferences, right?
[03:43:50.948 --> 03:44:02.012]  So she does these dog and pony shows where she brings in people who are illegal immigrants, college-age dreamers, talking about how wonderful all of this stuff is.
[03:44:02.072 --> 03:44:10.916]  And guys, if you got this from yesterday's show, I want you to cue up this clip number two where the lady says she was able to get scholarships and everything.
[03:44:12.096 --> 03:44:15.858]  She has sitting next to her a South Korean student.
[03:44:16.738 --> 03:44:20.479]  And the student says, yeah, I go to Azusa Pacifica College.
[03:44:20.499 --> 03:44:22.439]  And we're going to play that clip for you here in a minute.
[03:44:22.799 --> 03:44:28.200]  And as she's talking about what she's doing, Hillary Clinton is sitting there nodding and smiling approvingly.
[03:44:28.260 --> 03:44:39.062]  And what she says, yeah, I'm an undocumented immigrant from South Korea, and I came here for college, and I'm getting all of my scholarships and grants through DACA, the Dreamer program.
[03:44:39.962 --> 03:44:45.243]  And so I looked at that, and I said, well, how much tuition are we talking about here at Azusa Pacific College?
[03:44:46.420 --> 03:44:48.121]  Well, their tuition alone is $35,500 a year.
[03:44:48.141 --> 03:44:53.263]  But the college says plan on $44,500 because it's going to be service fees, room and board, housing and a meal plan.
[03:44:53.284 --> 03:44:54.404]  So figure on about $44,400 a year.
[03:45:05.066 --> 03:45:06.147]  Understand what's going on.
[03:45:06.187 --> 03:45:08.728]  This is called a full-ride scholarship.
[03:45:09.549 --> 03:45:14.532]  This is the most coveted scholarship that American students have to work very hard for.
[03:45:14.952 --> 03:45:25.358]  American students don't get in-state tuition unless their parents have lived in a state and paid taxes in that state to support these tax-funded organizations.
[03:45:25.438 --> 03:45:26.279]  They're subsidized.
[03:45:26.299 --> 03:45:29.081]  That's one of the reasons why the prices are so expensive.
[03:45:30.421 --> 03:45:32.583]  This lady who comes here from South Korea
[03:45:33.894 --> 03:45:39.479]  And again, five years ago, they're talking about how South Korean students are just balking at the high cost of college.
[03:45:39.519 --> 03:45:41.581]  I said, you know, it's really not worth it to get a college degree.
[03:45:41.801 --> 03:45:52.371]  I'm having to pay $7,000 a year to go to college in South Korea, and I'm getting out of here with like $35,000 in debt that I can't do anything with.
[03:45:52.391 --> 03:45:54.073]  They say the cost of tuition is too high.
[03:45:54.193 --> 03:45:55.954]  It's not really helping me to get a job.
[03:45:55.974 --> 03:45:58.337]  They point out that $3 million
[03:46:00.231 --> 03:46:08.234]  South Korean students, which is about the number that they got enrolled in a given year, okay, about 3.3 million, couldn't find jobs after they got their college degrees.
[03:46:08.494 --> 03:46:14.276]  Plus they had, you know, $35,000 in student loans that they had, that they'd gone into debt for.
[03:46:14.856 --> 03:46:17.757]  So what's a poor South Korean student going to do?
[03:46:17.777 --> 03:46:18.957]  Hey, here's an idea.
[03:46:19.777 --> 03:46:20.958]  You can go to America.
[03:46:21.678 --> 03:46:27.179]  Because Hillary and Obama will give you a full-ride scholarship, no questions asked.
[03:46:27.579 --> 03:46:32.440]  And you don't end up with a student loan, the American taxpayer ends up with a student loan.
[03:46:33.581 --> 03:46:37.761]  And over four years, that's $177,000 for this lady.
[03:46:38.582 --> 03:46:45.043]  All she did was just come here, in defiance of our laws, and demand this largesse.
[03:46:46.547 --> 03:46:48.889]  Which ought to make you spitting mad.
[03:46:49.410 --> 03:46:51.192]  It makes me really mad to see this going on.
[03:46:51.472 --> 03:46:52.613]  And when does it stop?
[03:46:53.454 --> 03:47:01.161]  Because we've got both Bernie and Hillary saying that they're going to continue doing this.
[03:47:01.202 --> 03:47:01.942]  Let's play that clip.
[03:47:01.962 --> 03:47:02.843]  They've got that clip ready.
[03:47:03.304 --> 03:47:04.004]  Let's play the clip.
[03:47:04.024 --> 03:47:05.886]  And this is what she said with Hillary.
[03:47:06.226 --> 03:47:08.869]  And Hillary's sitting right there with her, smiling and approving.
[03:47:09.129 --> 03:47:09.450]  Here we go.
[03:47:10.518 --> 03:47:15.160]  Others like Clara Kim, here illegally from South Korea, goes to Azusa Pacific.
[03:47:15.580 --> 03:47:18.961]  She was able to get help with tuition despite her legal status.
[03:47:19.221 --> 03:47:23.082]  I was able to get scholarships and grants through DACA.
[03:47:23.322 --> 03:47:27.483]  DACA and DAPA are government programs which, among other things... There you go.
[03:47:27.543 --> 03:47:33.645]  Now, let's get that other clip because I want to play for you how the press is playing along with this.
[03:47:33.745 --> 03:47:35.046]  This is CBS out of L.A.
[03:47:36.215 --> 03:47:38.356]  Uh, let's get that third clip that we had from yesterday's show.
[03:47:38.396 --> 03:47:39.336]  We didn't even play it yesterday.
[03:47:39.356 --> 03:47:41.136]  Uh, where they wrap that up.
[03:47:41.216 --> 03:47:42.057]  Clip number three.
[03:47:42.777 --> 03:47:43.937]  But, let's talk about this.
[03:47:44.397 --> 03:47:47.558]  This one individual comes over here and rips us off for $177,000.
[03:47:48.058 --> 03:47:50.339]  Gets a full free ride scholarship because, simply because, she's illegal.
[03:47:56.112 --> 03:47:59.993]  Again, in defiance of our laws, because she's illegal, we give her special benefits.
[03:48:00.513 --> 03:48:06.194]  It made me so angry to look at the Libertarian Party debating open borders and immigration.
[03:48:06.714 --> 03:48:09.375]  These people were so absolutely clueless.
[03:48:10.175 --> 03:48:14.916]  And of course, we've got Gary Johnson and William Weld throwing the Second Amendment under the bus.
[03:48:14.936 --> 03:48:18.937]  But on open borders, they were online with the Libertarian Party, I'm afraid to say.
[03:48:19.637 --> 03:48:24.638]  And saying, well, you know, it's not really a problem because even though we've got open borders,
[03:48:25.838 --> 03:48:30.322]  And that could bankrupt the country, as Milton Friedman pointed out 30 or 40 years ago.
[03:48:32.023 --> 03:48:36.928]  People who are not citizens aren't going to get those welfare benefits.
[03:48:36.968 --> 03:48:37.588]  It's like, oh really?
[03:48:37.948 --> 03:48:44.334]  Tell that to the South Korean lady who came in and gave herself $177,000 in free college tuition.
[03:48:44.614 --> 03:48:46.696]  Why don't we just do that for all the South Korean people?
[03:48:47.296 --> 03:48:52.101]  All the students, all 3.5, 3.6 million South Korean college students.
[03:48:52.422 --> 03:48:53.102]  Let them all come here.
[03:48:53.143 --> 03:48:56.166]  Why should they bother to go into debt to pay for their education?
[03:48:56.426 --> 03:48:57.768]  Let them all come to America.
[03:48:58.228 --> 03:49:03.033]  Because that would only be 637 billion dollars a year that they would put on us.
[03:49:03.894 --> 03:49:19.882]  And indebt us, indebt our children, take our homes with property taxes to pay for this nonsense, because, quite frankly, that is the policy that Bernie, that Hillary, that the Libertarian Party, and Gary Johnson, and William Weld, they all support that.
[03:49:20.322 --> 03:49:27.346]  Open the borders, we want free and open borders, and we want everybody to come in, and we want to give them free college tuition.
[03:49:28.006 --> 03:49:28.787]  Free college tuition.
[03:49:29.514 --> 03:49:31.056]  And so, where does it stop?
[03:49:31.296 --> 03:49:32.177]  That's just one country.
[03:49:32.237 --> 03:49:33.319]  South Korea be 637.
[03:49:33.939 --> 03:49:41.248]  Do we as American taxpayers have to have the IRS hold a gun to our head and force us to pay for the college education?
[03:49:41.268 --> 03:49:42.269]  I know it's pointed out this way.
[03:49:42.549 --> 03:49:43.230]  It's worthless!
[03:49:44.269 --> 03:49:49.070]  An American college education is mostly worthless unless you get something in engineering or medicine.
[03:49:49.590 --> 03:49:50.951]  It's a worthless degree.
[03:49:51.011 --> 03:49:51.871]  What are they teaching them?
[03:49:52.291 --> 03:49:53.031]  Hate white people.
[03:49:53.051 --> 03:49:55.292]  What are they going to do with that when they go back to South Korea?
[03:49:55.792 --> 03:49:57.012]  There's no white people there to hate.
[03:49:57.192 --> 03:50:00.973]  Well, I guess they could hate us because we paid for the college tuition, couldn't they?
[03:50:01.273 --> 03:50:03.194]  And then this is what CBS has to say.
[03:50:03.214 --> 03:50:04.094]  Let's play that clip.
[03:50:05.031 --> 03:50:10.935]  Both Aguilar and Mendez fully support what they heard from Hillary Clinton today, and they would love to support her in November.
[03:50:11.595 --> 03:50:13.697]  But given their status, they can't vote.
[03:50:14.077 --> 03:50:15.738]  They're part of the issue.
[03:50:15.758 --> 03:50:22.963]  11 million people in this country illegally who can't vote in an election that figures to great... I want to bang my head against the wall.
[03:50:24.013 --> 03:50:26.254]  They would love to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[03:50:26.555 --> 03:50:30.897]  This is an issue that affects their future, and they would love to vote for her, but they can't because they're not citizens.
[03:50:31.298 --> 03:50:33.299]  Do you realize the absurdity of this?
[03:50:33.879 --> 03:50:37.342]  And that guy is smiling there for CBS and LA?
[03:50:37.362 --> 03:50:38.222]  It's pathetic.
[03:50:38.282 --> 03:50:42.925]  And then their article says this, Aguilar and other undocumented students at the event said they were committed to Clinton too.
[03:50:43.225 --> 03:50:49.870]  However, like millions of other undocumented immigrants, they will not be able to vote in next week's primary or the general election.
[03:50:49.930 --> 03:50:51.591]  Don't worry, they're going to change that.
[03:50:52.071 --> 03:50:55.632]  She said the central issue of her campaign, and she's got two central issues.
[03:50:55.852 --> 03:50:57.813]  We'll talk about the other one, guns, when we come back.
[03:50:58.053 --> 03:50:59.714]  She said the central issue is immigration.
[03:50:59.974 --> 03:51:02.595]  Within 100 days, I'm going to make all these people voters.
[03:51:02.715 --> 03:51:05.056]  They will be reliable little minions for her.
[03:51:05.336 --> 03:51:09.498]  All she has to do is steal from you and give them a free college education.
[03:51:09.538 --> 03:51:10.098]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:10.996 --> 03:51:13.597]  A new tell-all book is shocking the Hillary campaign.
[03:51:13.757 --> 03:51:19.898]  Crisis of Character, a White House Secret Service officer discloses his first-hand experience with Hillary, Bill, and how they operate.
[03:51:19.918 --> 03:51:25.020]  It was written by former Secret Service agent Gary Byrne, who was posted outside the Oval Office during the Clinton years.
[03:51:25.300 --> 03:51:28.761]  The book reveals a real personality of Hillary, not the fake one you see on TV.
[03:51:29.181 --> 03:51:32.902]  And it's already at number one at Amazon despite not being released until June 28th.
[03:51:33.082 --> 03:51:34.062]  But what's in the book?
[03:51:34.323 --> 03:51:39.524]  Well, it portrays Hillary as, quote, too erratic, uncontrollable, and occasionally violent to become president.
[03:51:39.664 --> 03:51:43.325]  Byrne describes Hillary as acting friendly one moment, then raging the next.
[03:51:43.705 --> 03:51:48.747]  In fact, Secret Service agents discussed the possibility they would have to protect Bill from his wife's physical attacks.
[03:51:49.147 --> 03:51:53.151]  And the couple had one violent encounter the morning of a key presidential address to the nation.
[03:51:53.432 --> 03:52:02.041]  Byrne wrote, quote, Hillary Clinton is now poised to become the Democratic nominee for the President of the United States, but she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office.
[03:52:02.362 --> 03:52:04.624]  From the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true.
[03:52:04.904 --> 03:52:07.687]  And you can find out more at InfoWars.com.
[03:52:07.767 --> 03:52:08.949]  This is Gabe Daniels reporting.

[03:54:17.355 --> 03:54:19.496]  Welcome back to our final segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:19.557 --> 03:54:20.117]  I'm David Knight.
[03:54:20.137 --> 03:54:22.859]  I want to talk about Hillary and guns.
[03:54:23.519 --> 03:54:33.446]  But before I do, just real quickly, I'll mention one more time, today is the final day of our introductory special of the Alexa Pure Breeze Ion Cluster Air Purification System.
[03:54:33.746 --> 03:54:34.466]  That's a mouthful.
[03:54:35.047 --> 03:54:37.829]  But I tell you what, it's a breath of fresh air.
[03:54:38.149 --> 03:54:39.250]  That's what you want in your home.
[03:54:39.290 --> 03:54:42.212]  It's going to get that stale air that's in your locked up home.
[03:54:42.432 --> 03:54:43.092]  It's going to clean it.
[03:54:43.392 --> 03:54:46.995]  It's going to do it quietly, efficiently, and give you as a byproduct
[03:54:47.735 --> 03:54:48.796]  Some clean water.

[03:55:10.746 --> 03:55:12.388]  It is a great deal.
[03:55:12.488 --> 03:55:13.669]  That ends today.
[03:55:13.689 --> 03:55:16.851]  Alexa Pure Breeze air purification system.
[03:55:17.011 --> 03:55:19.533]  And it's the final day for our lung cleanse.
[03:55:19.553 --> 03:55:21.114]  20% off at Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:22.395 --> 03:55:22.696]  Guns.
[03:55:23.576 --> 03:55:29.140]  Hillary Clinton said that immigration and making illegals legal
[03:55:30.100 --> 03:55:34.964]  Is going to be the center part of her campaign, but of course, gun confiscation is a big part of it as well.
[03:55:35.644 --> 03:55:39.007]  She's talking about this throughout California, a very popular thing for her to talk about.
[03:55:39.087 --> 03:55:45.571]  One thing that she's hit Bernie Sanders on, because even Bernie Sanders doesn't want the kind of gun control that Hillary Clinton does.
[03:55:46.472 --> 03:55:56.820]  See, he voted, as most other people did, for a reasonable law, the PLCAA, Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.
[03:55:57.898 --> 03:55:58.519]  What is that about?
[03:55:58.739 --> 03:56:07.011]  That says simply that you can't sue gun manufacturers who aren't liable for the product that they make.
[03:56:07.031 --> 03:56:10.717]  They make a product and it's a gun and you can't sue them because you don't like guns.
[03:56:11.438 --> 03:56:12.840]  Well, Hillary Clinton wants to sue them.
[03:56:13.797 --> 03:56:25.862]  That's like saying, somebody got killed with a Ford, so we're going to come after Ford because we don't like cars, we know that Ford's got a lot of money, so we're going to shut down the automobile industry because we're inner-city liberals and we hate cars.
[03:56:26.002 --> 03:56:29.164]  Well, that's what these people are doing with guns, so they passed a law.
[03:56:30.137 --> 03:56:37.301]  Just to underscore, I guess, the Second Amendment, or maybe, you know, you start to get the idea, don't you, that the Constitution is no longer in effect.
[03:56:38.121 --> 03:56:40.342]  That's another story for another day.
[03:56:41.103 --> 03:56:44.624]  But why do we even need to have a PLCAA?
[03:56:44.665 --> 03:56:47.586]  Well, one of the reasons we need to have it is for people like Hillary Clinton.
[03:56:47.606 --> 03:56:50.988]  You can point to it and you can say, shut up, we've addressed this specifically.
[03:56:51.228 --> 03:56:58.872]  Just in case you don't understand what shall not infringe means, then we have passed a special law for you, Hillary, but she wants to get rid of it.
[03:56:59.705 --> 03:57:04.688]  And she said this yesterday on This Week with George Stephanopoulos, one of the Sunday shows.
[03:57:05.008 --> 03:57:07.329]  She outlined her plan to abolish the Second Amendment.
[03:57:08.370 --> 03:57:11.371]  First she says, I'm not seeking to abolish the Second Amendment.
[03:57:11.771 --> 03:57:14.773]  I'm just seeking to make it unapplicable, okay?
[03:57:14.813 --> 03:57:17.434]  We're going to shut down gun manufacturers.
[03:57:17.474 --> 03:57:20.236]  We're going to track ammunition.
[03:57:20.276 --> 03:57:24.078]  We're going to make sure that you can't buy ammunition without a background check.
[03:57:24.098 --> 03:57:28.480]  All the stuff, you know, that the Libertarian Party candidates supported when they were governors?
[03:57:28.940 --> 03:57:36.692]  Okay, William Weld supported all this stuff and people called him out on it and said, wait a minute, libertarians are supposed to be pro-Second Amendment, pro-self-defense.
[03:57:36.712 --> 03:57:40.358]  And he said, oh, those weren't hunting rifles that I wanted to confiscate.
[03:57:41.218 --> 03:57:42.859]  Okay, put background checks and ammunition.
[03:57:42.899 --> 03:57:52.285]  Hillary Clinton says, I'm going to continue to speak out for comprehensive background checks, closing gun show loopholes, closing the online loophole, closing the so-called Charleston loophole.
[03:57:52.466 --> 03:57:54.227]  You know, these are not loopholes.
[03:57:55.007 --> 03:57:57.949]  The Constitution says, shall not infringe.
[03:57:58.630 --> 03:58:07.295]  That means that you don't take your fence and move it onto your neighbor's property by one foot, and then leave it there.
[03:58:07.576 --> 03:58:10.778]  And then, after a period of time, say, that's mine now.
[03:58:11.438 --> 03:58:13.179]  That's what they're doing with your rights.
[03:58:13.499 --> 03:58:15.840]  They're gradually moving the boundaries.
[03:58:16.420 --> 03:58:20.801]  They are turning your fundamental rights into government-granted privileges.
[03:58:21.281 --> 03:58:22.442]  That's the way they always do it.
[03:58:22.922 --> 03:58:24.322]  That's what Hillary Clinton wants to do.
[03:58:24.722 --> 03:58:29.184]  That's what, unfortunately, even the Libertarians are supporting now in their ticket.
[03:58:29.824 --> 03:58:32.385]  Makes me just unbelievable to see what they're doing.
[03:58:32.465 --> 03:58:33.405]  Listen, join us tonight.
[03:58:33.425 --> 03:58:34.946]  We're out of time on this radio show.
[03:58:34.986 --> 03:58:38.467]  Tonight, we're going to talk about the billionaire bug-out rockets.
[03:58:38.487 --> 03:58:39.667]  We're going to talk about Brexit.
[03:58:39.707 --> 03:58:41.067]  We're going to talk about Bilderberg.
[03:58:41.127 --> 03:58:41.648]  Join us then.
[03:58:41.668 --> 03:58:43.108]  7 Central, 8 p.m.
