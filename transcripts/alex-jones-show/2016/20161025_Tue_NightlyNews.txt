[00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.149]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.217]  It is Tuesday, October 25th, 2016 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:27.238]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:40.356]  Hillary Clinton's campaign rallies have such a low turnout that she actually got Jay-Z to headline a concert for her.
[00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:47.539]  That way, it looks like she's real popular when she shows up on stage with the mainstream media cameras rolling.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.843]  Meanwhile, Donald Trump continues to draw full-capacity, enthusiastic audiences nationwide.
[00:00:58.083 --> 00:01:01.425]  Then, the death spiral of Obamacare.
[00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:07.027]  Double-digit costs go through the roof, and there are few insurance companies to choose from.
[00:01:07.787 --> 00:01:17.692]  Meanwhile, Barack Obama goes into full spin mode, and WikiLeaks reveals that even Hillary would like to see Obamacare completely unraveled.
[00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.835]  All that plus much more, up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.041]  Look, I'm not going to sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:36.303]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:01:36.323 --> 00:01:37.424]  Because it's already here.
[00:01:37.824 --> 00:01:38.484]  It's being announced.
[00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:42.307]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:44.048]  You don't let them break your will.
[00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:56.757]  Go to infowars.com forward slash app and download an app that took us over a year to develop that we're going to be expanding on the next few months with free video and audio and podcast feeds and breaking news and alerts and so much more.
[00:01:57.037 --> 00:01:59.979]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:01.120]  Take action!
[00:02:04.822 --> 00:02:06.723]  I train two, three times a day.
[00:02:07.503 --> 00:02:11.806]  They're brutal, agonizing, painful training sessions.
[00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.190]  I have to have the edge over my opponents.
[00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:24.094]  I believe that InfoWars products, Super Male Vitality, you know, that gives me the edge.
[00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:27.056]  Well, you have to know where you break.
[00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:30.740]  You know, ultimately, like, you don't push yourself to know where that breaking point is.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.422]  You're always going to be falling short of what your potential is.
[00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:39.609]  So it's really just about finding how far you can go.
[00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:57.877]  There's a lot of different things out there.
[00:02:58.981 --> 00:02:59.884]  I only use the best.
[00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.410]  Well, all eyes are on the Obamacare death spiral.
[00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.950]  It's going to be a tumultuous open enrollment season.
[00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.951]  Of course, we're going to be seeing double-digit cost spikes and disappearing choices.
[00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:30.854]  Now, the Obama administration did confirm Monday that there's going to be a sharp rise in planned premiums for 2017, and many Americans are going to have to choose plans from only one Obamacare insurer in their region.
[00:03:31.454 --> 00:03:32.954]  So yeah, no competition there.
[00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:43.538]  Consumers are going to see the premiums for a mid-level benchmark insurance plan jump an average of 25% in the states with exchanges run by the federal government.
[00:03:44.078 --> 00:03:50.900]  And in addition, that's going to be 20% of Obamacare customers being forced to choose from just one health insurance carrier.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:04:00.388]  Now, of course, the Obama administration is trying to shamelessly spin this thing as a win, even though they knew this was going to be a huge debacle from the start.
[00:04:00.788 --> 00:04:09.135]  They're trying to say, this is the Secretary of Health and Human Services, hey, well, it's not as bad as we initially thought it was going to be, she says.
[00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:13.739]  Independent experts who calculate that marketplace premiums are currently
[00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:20.501]  12 to 20 percent lower than the Congressional Budget Office predicted when the Affordable Care Act was passed.
[00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:24.002]  So they're like, hey, well, you guys thought it was going to be a huge debacle.
[00:04:24.062 --> 00:04:31.284]  And now it's, you know, it's only about 12 percent smaller of the debacle that that we were, you know, anticipating.
[00:04:31.464 --> 00:04:35.625]  But of course, we still had to pass it to find out what was in it, a big pile of poo.
[00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:37.465]  And I think that that's very clear now.
[00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:39.946]  And then she also goes on to tweet out saying,
[00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:46.103]  You know, basically chill out because there's lots of government assistance available for people to get them covered.
[00:04:46.463 --> 00:04:49.805]  But I'm sorry, does anyone else see the problem with that?
[00:04:50.146 --> 00:05:02.395]  Why do we have so many people down and out that they're bragging about the fact that so many people are going to need and will be able to receive government assistance, federal aid to get this
[00:05:02.975 --> 00:05:04.176]  Affordable care.
[00:05:04.276 --> 00:05:05.778]  I mean, it's totally ridiculous.
[00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:06.979]  It's such a sham.
[00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:09.981]  And they knew it was going to be that way from the beginning.
[00:05:10.442 --> 00:05:14.765]  Now we have people saying that the Democrats are going to have to face the music on this.
[00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:20.911]  The Republicans had been warning people about that when they were first opposing the Affordable Care Act, opposing this law.
[00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:34.479]  Now MSNBC's Casey Hunt stated on Tuesday she believes Democrats are going to have to answer for these skyrocketing Obamacare premiums because, of course, this is how the demands for this law are going to change.
[00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:35.740]  It's going to come from the bottom up.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:49.409]  Voters are going to be feeling the pain of this, especially since every year it continues to rise and people are being forced to pay these huge premiums or huge penalties if they can't opt in to the exchanges altogether.
[00:05:50.543 --> 00:06:01.268]  But don't get too excited thinking, wow, you know, this thing's going to unravel, we're going to undo this, they're going to throw us a bone, because that has been the plan all along so they could roll out single payer.
[00:06:01.328 --> 00:06:12.973]  Now, even though Hillary Clinton was publicly praising Obama and his health care initiative behind the scenes, she knew it was going to unravel and she was already planning for how she could support the unraveling of it.
[00:06:13.033 --> 00:06:16.655]  Now, you'll recall there was a WikiLeaks email released with the
[00:06:17.535 --> 00:06:18.696]  So, she knew it was doomed to fail.
[00:06:36.952 --> 00:06:45.914]  But she wants the Republicans' version of it to be able to pass so that they can be responsible for the unraveling of the Affordable Care Act, but they knew that that was going to happen the entire time.
[00:06:46.294 --> 00:06:57.877]  They just wanted to eke out these penalties, rape everyone and pillage them for these higher, higher premiums, and then eventually pass it with something even more sinister, even more controlling.
[00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:04.899]  It's a big screw you to the American people, but it's very interesting because Michael Moore came out and said a vote for Trump
[00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:08.641]  Is it going to be a big screw you to the establishment?
[00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.683]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:07:11.703 --> 00:07:14.285]  Now we have a brand new article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:07:14.645 --> 00:07:18.708]  Michael Moore, Trump's election will be the biggest FU in history.
[00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:30.216]  During a speech in his brand new one man stand called Trump Land, Michael Moore said that people are going to come out of the woodwork to vote for Donald Trump and it will be the biggest FU in history.
[00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:36.857]  He says he knows a lot of people in Michigan who are upset and want someone like Donald Trump because they've had their jobs stolen.
[00:07:37.097 --> 00:07:41.938]  Because we know Ford, the manufacturer, has moved a lot of their jobs down to Mexico.
[00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:45.459]  People are sick of their jobs being offshore to places like Mexico.
[00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:56.981]  Trump's promise to slap a 35% tariff on cars made in Mexico sent back to America was music to the ears of people in Detroit, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
[00:07:57.361 --> 00:07:59.862]  Now whether Trump means it or not, it's kind of
[00:08:00.322 --> 00:08:06.244]  Irrelevant because he's saying the things that people who are hurting want to hear and they're sick and tired of being beat down.
[00:08:06.724 --> 00:08:13.965]  Now Michael Moore goes on to say that the elites hate Donald Trump, the media hates Donald Trump, career politicians hate Donald Trump.
[00:08:14.165 --> 00:08:18.707]  That's why come November 8th, people are going to mark a huge X besides the name Donald Trump.
[00:08:19.147 --> 00:08:19.427]  Why?
[00:08:19.467 --> 00:08:24.128]  To send a huge F you to the elite and everyone else who screwed them over in America.
[00:08:25.285 --> 00:08:30.186]  Thousands of people showed up today for the Donald Trump rally that was held in Sanford, Florida.
[00:08:30.247 --> 00:08:34.348]  People were lining up 12 hours before the start of this rally.
[00:08:34.368 --> 00:08:39.369]  About 7,000 people had already made it into the hangar at about 2 o'clock.
[00:08:39.489 --> 00:08:42.210]  Thousands of people were still outside trying to get in.
[00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.191]  Absolute insanity there.
[00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:45.391]  Are you
[00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:09.414]  Total complete opposite of what we're seeing with Donald Trump versus Hillary supporters.
[00:09:09.774 --> 00:09:14.039]  She has to coax people and con them into getting them to come to her rallies.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.905]  Meanwhile, people are like lining up hours ahead of time to see Donald Trump.
[00:09:18.945 --> 00:09:19.806]  Now Alex Jones
[00:09:20.306 --> 00:09:27.110]  And Owen Schroyer both have some individual takes on this rally and what Trump's speech entailed there today.
[00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.731]  So that's coming up later in the show.
[00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:35.474]  But we just wanted to kind of point out how manufactured the consent is for Hillary Clinton to become the president.
[00:09:35.934 --> 00:09:42.538]  A new WikiLeaks email shows that her campaign was actually plotting a fake grassroots
[00:09:43.018 --> 00:09:46.460]  Campaign using celebs to con youth into voting for her.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:53.983]  Their concept paper strategizing, it should feel almost like we got together and decided to do this on our own.
[00:09:54.203 --> 00:09:55.784]  Oh, because we just love her so much.
[00:09:55.844 --> 00:10:01.827]  And it's basically spelling out how they could use young elected officials and entertainers to build a
[00:10:02.347 --> 00:10:09.853]  Quote, grassroots movement of under 40 voters as a vehicle to migrate support for Bernie into activism for Hillary.
[00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:20.623]  So you'll recall there when we saw Lena Dunham and Madonna and Katy Perry and all these other celebrities kind of telling the Bernie supporters, quit being ridiculous.
[00:10:21.283 --> 00:10:24.366]  Sarah Silverman said, you're quit being ridiculous, Bernie supporters.
[00:10:24.406 --> 00:10:25.567]  Just come on over to Hillary.
[00:10:26.207 --> 00:10:33.310]  So this is where we were really starting to see, but even they put the word grassroots in quotes because they know it's a total top-down con job.
[00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:38.232]  This is the only way that she can fill her rallies is by conning people into supporting her.
[00:10:38.312 --> 00:10:44.174]  That's why she is trying to copy Donald Trump's enthusiasm the supporters have for him.
[00:10:44.654 --> 00:10:46.295]  She is gonna throw a concert
[00:10:46.915 --> 00:10:48.456]  With Jay-Z as the headliner.
[00:10:48.476 --> 00:10:49.716]  So this is going to be in Cleveland.
[00:10:50.136 --> 00:10:53.658]  And she's also tweeting out about how LeBron James is going to be there.
[00:10:53.738 --> 00:10:55.579]  Oh, everybody come and get to the show.
[00:10:56.119 --> 00:11:03.322]  So Hillary Clinton is basically the opening act for this big concert that's going to be held in Cleveland.
[00:11:03.382 --> 00:11:05.303]  She can't even get people to show up.
[00:11:05.763 --> 00:11:08.945]  Without having something phenomenal that she knows people are going to want to be at.
[00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:17.190]  Anyway, we've seen how she's hijacked Memorial Day parties and Fourth of July parties and things to say, oh, look at all these people that have showed up for me.
[00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:21.252]  And they're all kind of going, well, I thought this was a Labor Day picnic.
[00:11:21.332 --> 00:11:22.473]  I don't know what's going on here.
[00:11:22.913 --> 00:11:33.019]  So as we're seeing now that she has these totally manufactured crowds, manufactured enthusiasm, is that going to backfire on her come voting day?
[00:11:34.275 --> 00:11:42.263]  There's an article up on our website written by Paul Joseph Watson talking about Huckabee, Governor Huckabee, of course, and something that he said on Fox News.
[00:11:42.344 --> 00:11:50.853]  And the Clinton camp, he points out, is trying to paint their win as a foregone conclusion in the media and saying that the election has already won.
[00:11:51.193 --> 00:11:53.936]  Huge mistake, as Paul Joseph Watson points out.
[00:11:54.396 --> 00:11:57.618]  And he should know, after all, the same thing happened with Brexit.
[00:11:57.658 --> 00:12:02.402]  Similar situation, media reports, it's not happening, it's not happening, and of course then it happened.
[00:12:02.442 --> 00:12:21.334]  So this is what Paul writes, good luck with that of course, he highlights the fact that Mike Huckabee pointed out the fact that this strategy on behalf of the Clinton campaign, helped by the media, in which the media is saying that she's already won, because they're trying to depress the vote, it might in fact backfire, and some Trump supporters, they've claimed that
[00:12:21.534 --> 00:12:33.421]  The Clinton camp is deliberately stoking that narrative so that the election result is a foregone conclusion in an effort to kill the enthusiasm behind Trump's campaign and make his supporters think that their vote is worthless.
[00:12:34.422 --> 00:12:41.586]  Huckabee goes on to say, I think the Hillary people are making a fundamental mistake and I hope they keep making it and here's their mistake.
[00:12:41.666 --> 00:12:44.968]  The one thing they can't afford to do is take their varied
[00:12:45.408 --> 00:12:46.169]  We're good to go.
[00:13:07.043 --> 00:13:12.705]  In this, because we understand that we're in a peak time where election fraud and voter fraud is at the forefront.
[00:13:12.745 --> 00:13:13.965]  So just be mindful of that.
[00:13:14.005 --> 00:13:15.346]  Take a look at this article as well.
[00:13:15.666 --> 00:13:16.866]  Tell us what you think about this.
[00:13:17.027 --> 00:13:17.787]  Is Huckabee right?
[00:13:18.127 --> 00:13:21.848]  The media's foregone conclusion that Hillary already has it in the bag.
[00:13:22.248 --> 00:13:23.889]  It could just come back to bite them in the butt.
[00:13:24.169 --> 00:13:26.790]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:13:28.134 --> 00:13:31.296]  Well, surprise, surprise, the president lied.
[00:13:31.796 --> 00:13:40.380]  Now, you'll recall he said that he first learned about Hillary Clinton's private email when he heard about it on the news, same time as all the rest of us.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.221]  Well, it turns out that was a lie.
[00:13:42.241 --> 00:13:47.964]  And we already knew that because we saw that he was exchanging emails with Hillary Clinton using a fake
[00:13:48.564 --> 00:13:48.864]  I don't know.
[00:14:08.695 --> 00:14:15.818]  So they knew they were in a pickle and now they're trying to clean up what the president came out and said because he lied once again on television.
[00:14:16.218 --> 00:14:22.440]  And of course, his press secretary came out the next day and just was kind of like, oh, well, of course he he he meant this.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:22.980]  He didn't mean that.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.682]  I mean, they're all scrambling to protect each other, but it's lies are hard to keep straight.
[00:14:27.722 --> 00:14:34.745]  The truth is much easier to tell, which, of course, is why we see once again, people there within the State Department are pleading the fifth.
[00:14:35.245 --> 00:14:41.748]  More than 90 times, the Fifth Amendment is the only amendment that the Clinton campaign seems to really care about.
[00:14:42.188 --> 00:14:43.248]  Now, this is John Bentle.
[00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:54.653]  He's the former Director of Information Resource Management of the Executive Secretariat, and he would not answer any questions about whether the Clintons had paid his legal fees or offered him financial incentives.
[00:14:55.373 --> 00:15:05.457]  And a federal judge ordered that Bentl had to testify under oath because the record in this case appears to contradict his sworn testimony before the Benghazi committee.
[00:15:05.897 --> 00:15:13.820]  Now in June 2015, he told the House Select Committee that he had no knowledge of Clinton's private email server, but it turns out
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:26.969]  That Bentl actually told employees in his office that Secretary Clinton's email arrangement had been approved by the State Department's legal staff and also instructed his subordinates not to discuss her email again.
[00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:28.831]  So here we go, people.
[00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:29.531]  They don't care.
[00:15:29.591 --> 00:15:31.072]  They're swearing under oath.
[00:15:31.713 --> 00:15:37.897]  And turns out later that they are lying, just like Hillary Clinton when she was under oath saying, Turkey?
[00:15:37.917 --> 00:15:40.579]  I don't know anything about shipping weapons anywhere.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.140]  We'll see.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.241]  Will they be brought to justice?
[00:15:43.321 --> 00:15:43.801]  Who knows?
[00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:56.046]  Now, we saw the other day that Donna Brazile was kind of in a little kerfuffle there with Megyn Kelly, and she's basically really trying to push out this agenda that her emails had been doctored.
[00:15:56.106 --> 00:15:59.428]  She continues to say, I've seen so many of them that have been doctored.
[00:15:59.488 --> 00:16:00.868]  Things coming from me at 2 a.m.
[00:16:00.888 --> 00:16:03.149]  that I never sent, which is total crap.
[00:16:03.209 --> 00:16:04.130]  It's a total lie.
[00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.571]  Point specifically to what emails have been doctored, but they can't.
[00:16:08.611 --> 00:16:09.692]  They just say, oh, I've seen them.
[00:16:10.032 --> 00:16:11.592]  I've seen some fakes and all that.
[00:16:11.953 --> 00:16:24.177]  Well, now tech bloggers are actually saying it took them less than five minutes to confirm that these emails were in fact verified, that they were sent between the Clinton campaign, Donna Brazile, etc.
[00:16:24.517 --> 00:16:27.678]  So this is a domain keys identified mail, DKIM.
[00:16:28.058 --> 00:16:28.138]  It's
[00:16:47.731 --> 00:16:48.011]  I don't know.
[00:17:06.138 --> 00:17:14.161]  But they're even going so far as saying, well, what if WikiLeaks got in and then they altered the DKIM key also because they're such good hackers?
[00:17:14.221 --> 00:17:27.646]  What if they, I mean, they're going that far, but you know, they say, look, then that means that they would have had to access the hillaryclinton.com server in order to change that key, which we know they didn't do because heck, even the FBI and the DOJ didn't access that.
[00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.610]  We have another article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:37.035]  Report, votes switch from Trump to Hillary Clinton in the least two cities in Texas.
[00:17:37.555 --> 00:17:42.440]  Residents of at least two cities in Texas are complaining that they voted for Donald Trump and it switched over.
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:47.384]  Now I actually went out yesterday here in Austin and did early voting myself.
[00:17:47.404 --> 00:17:54.771]  I've been very skeptical of these voting machines, so when I actually went through each page, I would submit, then go back,
[00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:58.355]  Look, take a picture if necessary, and then proceed on.
[00:17:58.695 --> 00:18:07.866]  It's very imperative, it's very important that you do photograph these machines if you do see anything wrong, if anything switches from the way that you are supposed to be voting.
[00:18:08.607 --> 00:18:09.829]  We've heard time and time again.
[00:18:10.269 --> 00:18:14.655]  And the primaries that people had their votes being switched over in these machines.
[00:18:14.675 --> 00:18:26.111]  We know that George Soros owns a lot of these machines and he is going to be very biased when he wants you to come out and vote a certain way regardless that you want to see Trump up there as the next president.
[00:18:26.531 --> 00:18:37.635]  So if you're gonna early vote or go out on November 8th, make sure that you take the time to read over each page before you submit, so you make sure that you have the chance to make America great again.
[00:18:37.955 --> 00:18:40.456]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.

[00:22:56.864 --> 00:22:57.364]  AncientDefense.com.
[00:22:57.384 --> 00:22:57.965]  It's official.
[00:22:58.045 --> 00:23:00.487]  Donald J. Trump has won the 2016 election in a massive landslide.
[00:23:14.537 --> 00:23:15.437]  I'm going to shoot you straight.
[00:23:16.018 --> 00:23:22.120]  A year and a half ago, I began to support Donald Trump, but I was holding my nose.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.441]  I didn't really know who he was.
[00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:38.107]  And after watching him go through this trial of fire, the demonization, the attacks, the lies, all the big billionaires, all of them, the communist Chinese, the corrupt Saudi Arabians, the Pope come out against him.
[00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:44.009]  And to see the globalists and both political parties and all the big political bosses line up against him.
[00:23:45.382 --> 00:23:48.364]  I am so proud of the fact that I chose the populist.
[00:23:48.464 --> 00:23:52.167]  I chose the man who was trying to defend this Republican who's gone through hell.
[00:23:52.767 --> 00:23:57.410]  Trump gave a speech today in Central Florida that was so incredibly powerful.
[00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:04.675]  There's no doubt in my mind, I just got done watching it live, that if every American saw that speech, he would win by 70, 80%.
[00:24:04.735 --> 00:24:05.396]  But here's the issue.
[00:24:08.487 --> 00:24:18.253]  It's come out in the WikiLeaks that they're paying the polling agencies, the Democrats are, to oversample nine to 50 points more Democrats to show Hillary ahead.
[00:24:19.054 --> 00:24:24.257]  And that they have finance groups to go start riots and spout racist rhetoric at Trump events.
[00:24:24.338 --> 00:24:25.318]  It's so fixed.
[00:24:26.039 --> 00:24:35.445]  And then I asked myself with so-called populist liberals, how could you not support somebody when the biggest banks and Wall Street and the robber barons are against him?
[00:24:36.744 --> 00:24:39.506]  Trump knows America has been given one-sided deals.
[00:24:39.907 --> 00:24:40.848]  We've been sold out.
[00:24:41.108 --> 00:24:42.429]  We were the greatest nation in the world.
[00:24:42.449 --> 00:24:45.031]  And the political class took over.
[00:24:45.732 --> 00:24:48.915]  And instead of innovating, they sold us out at the highest bidder.
[00:24:49.655 --> 00:24:54.660]  And now, as America is running on fumes, Trump is desperately trying to reverse that.
[00:24:55.555 --> 00:24:58.016]  And just so you understand, and you know this, I didn't need this.
[00:24:58.476 --> 00:25:01.418]  I didn't need this, but I was doing very well on the other side.
[00:25:01.438 --> 00:25:03.378]  I was, you know, definitely doing well.
[00:25:04.199 --> 00:25:06.960]  I didn't need this, but I'll tell you, I love our country.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.061]  I had to do it.
[00:25:08.421 --> 00:25:11.602]  I see where our country is going, and it's not good.
[00:25:11.622 --> 00:25:13.463]  It's really bad.
[00:25:16.744 --> 00:25:24.486]  My contract begins with a plan to end the rampant government corruption and to put the special interests out of business.
[00:25:24.566 --> 00:25:25.786]  It's all about special interests.
[00:25:26.866 --> 00:25:33.108]  I want everyone in Washington to hear and to heed the words I'm about to say.
[00:25:33.948 --> 00:25:45.971]  If we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C., and we, together, are going to drain the swamp.
[00:25:48.155 --> 00:25:58.004]  Under my contract with the American voter, we are proposing a series of ethics reforms on day one to end government corruption.
[00:25:58.044 --> 00:26:04.569]  They include a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.
[00:26:07.652 --> 00:26:08.092]  Important.
[00:26:09.033 --> 00:26:13.737]  A lifetime ban on government officials lobbying for a foreign government.
[00:26:13.957 --> 00:26:14.578]  You believe this?
[00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.892]  They get out, they lobby for it, they make a fortune.
[00:26:19.852 --> 00:26:24.656]  A total ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.
[00:26:24.756 --> 00:26:26.377]  Thank you very much, we don't need your money.
[00:26:26.917 --> 00:26:33.002]  I'm also going to take a series of actions on day one to protect American workers.
[00:26:34.235 --> 00:26:40.738]  We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.
[00:26:41.378 --> 00:26:52.744]  They are taking our companies, they are taking our jobs, and our politicians, many of whom are stupid and many of whom are corrupt, are allowing it to happen.
[00:26:53.064 --> 00:26:55.565]  We're not going to allow it any longer.
[00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:02.977]  Our nation has lost one third of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.
[00:27:03.758 --> 00:27:08.783]  A deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary Clinton.
[00:27:08.924 --> 00:27:15.331]  And by the way, the single worst trade deal ever made in history, anywhere.
[00:27:16.741 --> 00:27:17.562]  Listen to this.
[00:27:18.243 --> 00:27:19.003]  Hard to believe.
[00:27:19.084 --> 00:27:22.667]  I've told you before, I thought this was a typographical error.
[00:27:23.448 --> 00:27:32.317]  We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, WTO.
[00:27:32.758 --> 00:27:35.701]  Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster.
[00:27:35.741 --> 00:27:37.183]  But they've been nicely paid.
[00:27:37.203 --> 00:27:38.764]  Look at all the money they have pouring in.
[00:27:39.745 --> 00:27:48.832]  We will renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal to get a much better one for our workers and our companies.
[00:27:52.774 --> 00:27:54.736]  It's a one-way street, you know what I call it?
[00:27:55.076 --> 00:27:57.378]  It's a one-way highway right into Mexico.
[00:27:57.418 --> 00:28:01.381]  They get our jobs, they get our money, they get our plants and factories.
[00:28:01.581 --> 00:28:02.281]  You know what we get?
[00:28:02.842 --> 00:28:04.583]  Drugs and unemployment.
[00:28:04.623 --> 00:28:05.243]  That's what we get.
[00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:05.984]  We get nothing.
[00:28:07.159 --> 00:28:17.904]  Next, I'll work with Congress to introduce a series of legislative reforms and we'll fight for their passage in the first 100 days of my administration.
[00:28:18.225 --> 00:28:24.888]  And this legislation quickly includes Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act.
[00:28:27.748 --> 00:28:33.631]  So essentially, a middle class family with two children will get about a 35% tax reduction.
[00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:34.311]  Isn't that nice?
[00:28:34.331 --> 00:28:34.991]  It's about time.
[00:28:35.431 --> 00:28:38.713]  The middle class in our country has been devastated.
[00:28:39.193 --> 00:28:42.715]  And by the way, Crooked Hillary wants to raise your taxes up to the sky.
[00:28:42.735 --> 00:28:45.496]  She wants to raise... We're the highest taxed nation in the world.
[00:28:45.836 --> 00:28:48.537]  She wants to raise your taxes right up to the sky.
[00:28:49.478 --> 00:28:53.420]  So with only 13 days out, I want to make this declaration right now.
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.301]  Donald Trump has won.
[00:28:57.424 --> 00:29:04.087]  The 2016 election, whether they end up stealing it from him or whether he actually gets into office, it doesn't matter.
[00:29:05.187 --> 00:29:06.788]  Trump has promoted nationalism.
[00:29:07.288 --> 00:29:08.729]  Trump has exposed globalism.
[00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:12.130]  He has exposed the whole crony capitalist system.
[00:29:12.871 --> 00:29:15.252]  He has shown how unfair deals have been made.
[00:29:16.678 --> 00:29:27.206]  And if you thought the Liberty Movement with Barry Goldwater 50 years ago was powerful, or Ron Paul 10 years ago, or now Donald Trump, it is an exponential growth curve going straight up.
[00:29:28.167 --> 00:29:32.050]  Brexit, as the UK pulls out of the unelected, tyrannical EU.
[00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:33.971]  Russia pulling out of the oligarchs.
[00:29:35.132 --> 00:29:39.535]  Countries all over the world waking up and rediscovering self-determination.
[00:29:39.636 --> 00:29:41.157]  This is a magic moment.
[00:29:42.097 --> 00:29:43.118]  And it's happening right now.
[00:29:43.198 --> 00:29:45.280]  And Donald Trump, because of his courage.
[00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:50.391]  And his charisma has been a focal point to bring that out.
[00:29:51.332 --> 00:29:57.994]  And the truth is, we've never been able to fix our problems the last 30 years because we haven't had a leader that actually wanted to do that.
[00:29:58.614 --> 00:30:04.776]  Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following actions to restore the rule of law.
[00:30:05.737 --> 00:30:12.459]  These include, I will cancel every illegal Obamacare executive order.
[00:30:15.922 --> 00:30:20.404]  We'll cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities.
[00:30:20.604 --> 00:30:20.745]  Out.
[00:30:23.126 --> 00:30:29.049]  We will suspend immigration from regions comprised of radical Islamic terrorists.
[00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:52.385]  Including the suspension of the Syrian refugee program, which is taking in thousands and thousands of people that we have no idea where they come from, no idea who they are, and crooked Hillary Clinton wants to have that increased by 550% over and above the crazy Obama numbers, okay?
[00:30:57.469 --> 00:31:16.700]  But we have also just learned that one of the closest people to Hillary Clinton, with long-standing ties to her and her husband, the closest, THE closest person, I can tell you that, gave more, listen to this, just happened yesterday, gave more than $675,000 to the campaign
[00:31:21.543 --> 00:31:35.811]  Of the wife of a top FBI official who oversaw the investigation into Mrs. Clinton's illegal email server.
[00:31:36.151 --> 00:31:47.577]  In other words, the man who was in charge of the investigation of Hillary Clinton accepted, essentially, from Hillary Clinton, $675,000 that went to his wife.
[00:31:51.172 --> 00:31:53.374]  Hillary's Wall Street donors want it.
[00:31:54.355 --> 00:31:57.379]  And she'd approve it if she ever got the chance.
[00:31:57.419 --> 00:31:59.941]  She will approve TPP so fast.
[00:32:00.522 --> 00:32:01.523]  And she intends to.
[00:32:01.583 --> 00:32:07.569]  Tim Kaine has even left the door open to passing TPP by another name.
[00:32:07.609 --> 00:32:08.591]  Let's change the name.
[00:32:08.891 --> 00:32:10.272]  And by the way, folks, we're going to win.
[00:32:11.141 --> 00:32:13.902]  But regardless, don't let it happen.
[00:32:14.662 --> 00:32:16.462]  It's too complicated.
[00:32:17.162 --> 00:32:18.963]  You do one deal with another.
[00:32:19.423 --> 00:32:20.743]  One, one, one.
[00:32:21.123 --> 00:32:24.244]  Make individual deals with individual nations.
[00:32:24.564 --> 00:32:26.164]  Deal with the ones we want to deal with.
[00:32:26.405 --> 00:32:29.105]  You've got to see what this thing looks like, a piece of Swiss cheese.
[00:32:29.465 --> 00:32:36.747]  And if they default, you send them a letter of default, and by the time that 30-day notice ends, you'll have a new deal that's even better.
[00:32:37.782 --> 00:32:49.673]  This deal is too complicated, it's almost 6,000 pages long, and here's the thing, all of these other countries, they've read every single word, every comma, every period, every paragraph.
[00:32:50.334 --> 00:32:52.436]  I'll bet we have nobody that even reads these things.
[00:32:52.976 --> 00:32:59.002]  Bottom line, Trump is a godsend, an imperfect messenger of God, but nevertheless,
[00:33:00.325 --> 00:33:01.605]  A King David of our time.

[00:34:04.926 --> 00:34:09.888]  Now another shirt that was designed and licensed from Roger Stone is the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:13.229]  Looks like the, you know, communist style Obama Hope shirt.
[00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:19.932]  But says, rape, wear it, get aggressive, start the conversations, get on TV with it.
[00:34:19.952 --> 00:34:20.973]  In fact, I'm going to say this right now.
[00:34:21.393 --> 00:34:31.577]  Anyone that gets on national TV with the shirt, clearly, for more than five seconds, gets a thousand dollars.
[00:34:33.183 --> 00:34:34.784]  That means, you know, behind cameras, you name it.
[00:34:34.945 --> 00:34:45.894]  Anyone that gets it on air on national TV and gets the words out, Bill Clinton is a rapist, or things along that line with a bullhorn, I could go to this right now. $5,000.
[00:34:49.884 --> 00:34:52.287]  Until a budget of $100,000 has been spent.
[00:34:52.668 --> 00:34:54.150]  Adoptable dogs.
[00:34:54.250 --> 00:35:00.799]  Every year, the Best Friends Animal Society helps cats and dogs who are stuck in animal shelters find homes.
[00:35:05.686 --> 00:35:11.252]  I think one of the things that we really need to be looking at in this debate is that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:35:11.413 --> 00:35:12.374]  Infowars.com.
[00:35:12.474 --> 00:35:13.395]  Infowars.com.
[00:35:13.555 --> 00:35:14.436]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:35:14.776 --> 00:35:15.818]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:35:16.038 --> 00:35:16.258]  Alright.
[00:35:16.278 --> 00:35:17.199]  Bill Clinton.
[00:35:17.219 --> 00:35:23.927]  I got this Hillary for Prison t-shirt and I just want everyone to know about this big presidential campaign that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:35:24.047 --> 00:35:24.788]  Infowars.com.
[00:35:25.743 --> 00:35:26.123]  Okay.
[00:35:26.263 --> 00:35:27.604]  Thank you very much, Terrence.
[00:35:27.964 --> 00:35:29.585]  He doesn't age.
[00:35:29.805 --> 00:35:30.725]  No, he doesn't.
[00:35:30.765 --> 00:35:32.106]  He looks great.
[00:35:32.146 --> 00:35:33.907]  We're all gonna rickroll.
[00:35:34.187 --> 00:35:34.787]  Exactly.
[00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:37.929]  We've had a $100,000 contest before.
[00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.591]  My budget's $100,000.
[00:35:42.731 --> 00:35:46.293]  That means if a bunch of people do this, I'll pay up to $100,000 and stop it.
[00:35:56.971 --> 00:36:01.394]  That's $1,000 if you just get the shirt on national TV.
[00:36:03.135 --> 00:36:04.276]  Visually, rape.
[00:36:05.477 --> 00:36:05.757]  Okay?
[00:36:06.837 --> 00:36:07.218]  It is.
[00:36:08.493 --> 00:36:11.916]  It is $5,000 if you get the audio.
[00:36:11.956 --> 00:36:12.556]  Legally and lawfully.
[00:36:12.576 --> 00:36:21.983]  They've got to be outdoors, on their little bench, you've got to have a bullhorn, you've got to have the shirt on or have somebody with it, or maybe a big sign with it on it, and two of you hold it up, and then somebody else bullhorns.
[00:36:22.383 --> 00:36:25.545]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, not a philanderer.
[00:36:26.126 --> 00:36:27.567]  Hillary covers up the rape.
[00:36:32.478 --> 00:36:35.140]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.401]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[00:36:38.421 --> 00:36:39.522]  Because it's already here.
[00:36:39.922 --> 00:36:40.583]  It's being announced.
[00:36:40.923 --> 00:36:44.385]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.
[00:36:44.805 --> 00:36:46.706]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:36:46.866 --> 00:36:48.407]  A new battleship in the fight.
[00:36:48.607 --> 00:36:49.608]  InfoWars Live.
[00:36:49.788 --> 00:36:50.609]  Available right now.
[00:36:50.889 --> 00:36:52.250]  We're looking for a crew to man it.
[00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:55.071]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[00:36:55.792 --> 00:36:56.692]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[00:36:57.252 --> 00:37:00.254]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[00:37:00.754 --> 00:37:01.335]  Take action!
[00:37:06.523 --> 00:37:10.165]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[00:37:11.386 --> 00:37:12.486]  Yeah!
[00:37:12.526 --> 00:37:13.467]  There he is!
[00:37:13.607 --> 00:37:14.827]  Donald Trump!
[00:37:15.108 --> 00:37:15.808]  Our leader!
[00:37:16.268 --> 00:37:19.390]  Heading for the White House to drain the swamp.
[00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.290]  Look at that man!
[00:37:21.171 --> 00:37:25.093]  A battering ram into the global establishment.
[00:37:26.073 --> 00:37:29.355]  Historic numbers coming out for Donald Trump at these rallies.
[00:37:29.915 --> 00:37:31.196]  Tim Kaine got 30 people.
[00:37:32.536 --> 00:37:35.058]  30 people at a Hillary rally the other day.
[00:37:35.138 --> 00:37:36.519]  This is a Donald Trump rally.
[00:37:36.639 --> 00:37:37.640]  Look at that.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.582]  Welcome back to the Nightly News, everybody.
[00:37:40.622 --> 00:37:43.444]  TheInfoWars.com, Nightly News.
[00:37:43.864 --> 00:37:53.832]  The truth that is coming out of Donald Trump's mouth is rocking the entire world right now, and I feel bad for those who are missing out entirely.
[00:37:54.232 --> 00:37:58.075]  Here are the highlights from Donald Trump's historic speech in Florida today.
[00:37:58.835 --> 00:38:01.576]  I'll tell you what, the media, folks, is no good.
[00:38:01.616 --> 00:38:02.256]  They're no good.
[00:38:02.997 --> 00:38:04.017]  Very dishonest.
[00:38:05.457 --> 00:38:08.719]  In 14 days, we're going to win the state of Florida.
[00:38:08.799 --> 00:38:12.540]  We're going to win back the White House.
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.362]  The lines at the voting booths are record.
[00:38:20.203 --> 00:38:23.584]  And I noticed that a lot of the people
[00:38:24.628 --> 00:38:26.449]  You see the pictures?
[00:38:27.029 --> 00:38:29.731]  They're wearing the red hat, the white hat, this hat.
[00:38:29.751 --> 00:38:32.993]  They're wearing buttons all over the place.
[00:38:33.873 --> 00:38:37.255]  I think those are people that are inclined to vote for us.
[00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:39.716]  Do you agree?
[00:38:39.736 --> 00:38:45.359]  75% of the American people think our country is on the wrong track.
[00:38:45.479 --> 00:38:46.600]  Every poll says it.
[00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:56.392]  We are going to fix it and we are going to get our country back on the right track very, very quickly.
[00:38:57.212 --> 00:39:04.335]  Together we're going to deliver real change that once again puts America first.
[00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:15.878]  That begins with immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as Obamacare.
[00:39:16.538 --> 00:39:28.107]  Repealing Obamacare and stopping Hillary's healthcare takeover is one of the single most important reasons that we must win on November 8th.
[00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:33.713]  Change has to come from outside our corrupt system.
[00:39:34.213 --> 00:39:42.478]  The fact that the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign, which is actually a movement.
[00:39:42.498 --> 00:39:43.439]  This is a movement, folks.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:51.524]  And this is the last time we're going to have a chance.
[00:39:51.884 --> 00:39:52.925]  Four years, it's over.
[00:39:53.486 --> 00:39:53.926]  It's over.
[00:39:55.498 --> 00:39:57.841]  In four years, you don't have a chance.
[00:39:58.461 --> 00:40:01.725]  All these characters that want to run in four years, they can forget it.
[00:40:01.745 --> 00:40:02.806]  They're wasting their time.
[00:40:03.627 --> 00:40:06.751]  You don't have even a little bit of a chance.
[00:40:06.791 --> 00:40:07.292]  This is it.
[00:40:07.892 --> 00:40:08.913]  And we're really close.
[00:40:09.434 --> 00:40:10.475]  We're going to win Florida.
[00:40:11.737 --> 00:40:13.899]  $1,500 and an iPhone.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.242]  Go in the rally and beat people up.
[00:40:29.605 --> 00:40:33.186]  They found out our people are not so easy to beat up.
[00:40:33.246 --> 00:40:34.006]  That's for sure.
[00:40:34.566 --> 00:40:35.527]  But do you remember?
[00:40:36.447 --> 00:40:41.228]  Remember they went in and there was a policeman with blood pouring down his face.
[00:40:41.268 --> 00:40:43.529]  There was another one with a badly gashed face.
[00:40:43.729 --> 00:40:45.390]  This was all thugs put in there.
[00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:49.031]  And then I'm listening to her talk about peace at our rallies.
[00:40:49.091 --> 00:40:49.651]  We want peace.
[00:40:49.991 --> 00:40:52.472]  This is one of the great phonies of all time.
[00:40:52.772 --> 00:40:55.733]  And she shouldn't be allowed to run for president with what she's done.
[00:40:55.833 --> 00:40:56.573]  I'll tell you right now.
[00:40:57.475 --> 00:41:11.706]  The fact that the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop this movement is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once in a lifetime.
[00:41:11.746 --> 00:41:13.087]  This is once in a lifetime.
[00:41:13.988 --> 00:41:19.152]  I'm telling you, I opened the door, I looked out the window, I said, wow, it's so different from what they report.
[00:41:20.232 --> 00:41:23.195]  These people up here, they are the worst.
[00:41:25.612 --> 00:41:26.752]  And you know what it's called?
[00:41:27.553 --> 00:41:29.213]  By the way, you know what it's called, don't you?
[00:41:29.233 --> 00:41:31.154]  It's called voter suppression.
[00:41:31.774 --> 00:41:33.074]  Just keep it going, folks.
[00:41:33.114 --> 00:41:34.955]  We're fighting a crooked establishment.
[00:41:35.335 --> 00:41:42.857]  And just about the biggest part of the crooked establishment are these people right back there with the phony cameras.
[00:41:44.178 --> 00:41:45.678]  That some of the voting is rigged.
[00:41:45.738 --> 00:41:47.199]  Okay, everybody knows.
[00:41:47.539 --> 00:41:49.780]  Check out Philadelphia, Chicago, St.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.000]  Louis.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:53.421]  And he said, this is a threat to our system.
[00:41:53.941 --> 00:41:55.061]  This is terrible.
[00:41:55.321 --> 00:41:56.182]  This is a threat.
[00:41:56.702 --> 00:41:59.243]  Okay, I figured, gee whiz, wow, that's pretty bad.
[00:41:59.783 --> 00:42:06.345]  Except last night on television, last night, I'm watching Obama from eight years ago.
[00:42:06.905 --> 00:42:10.106]  And he's basically saying that the whole thing is fixed.
[00:42:11.567 --> 00:42:16.391]  Before he won his first race, he was talking about voting.
[00:42:16.971 --> 00:42:19.013]  And he said, remember, I come from Chicago.
[00:42:19.033 --> 00:42:20.794]  You know, I mean, you know, they do.
[00:42:21.275 --> 00:42:22.475]  Give me a break.
[00:42:22.516 --> 00:42:24.377]  This guy's such a phony guy.
[00:42:25.138 --> 00:42:26.038]  What a phony.
[00:42:27.219 --> 00:42:30.080]  The system, the whole system is rigged.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.480]  The whole system is rigged.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.461]  Keep your plan, keep your doctor.
[00:42:35.701 --> 00:42:36.321]  He lied.
[00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:44.603]  Jonathan Gruber said the American people are essentially stupid for approving and allowing Obamacare to happen.
[00:42:44.903 --> 00:42:45.563]  And you know what?
[00:42:45.903 --> 00:42:49.744]  We've got to show them on November 8th that we're not stupid.
[00:42:49.924 --> 00:42:50.784]  We're not stupid.
[00:42:52.056 --> 00:43:08.892]  Crooked Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 emails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 iPhones disappear, some with a hammer, then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times.
[00:43:08.952 --> 00:43:09.533]  Bad memory.
[00:43:21.107 --> 00:43:22.367]  They were sent by Russia!
[00:43:22.507 --> 00:43:22.968]  Russia!
[00:43:23.648 --> 00:43:27.429]  You know, they're always using Russia like I have something, I have nothing to do with Russia.
[00:43:27.969 --> 00:43:30.210]  They were sent by Russia and Donald Trump, you know.
[00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:35.352]  Can you imagine if I got the answers or the questions to a debate?
[00:43:36.232 --> 00:43:37.873]  It would be the electric chair, right?
[00:43:38.433 --> 00:43:38.833]  No, no.
[00:43:39.733 --> 00:43:42.134]  It would be the biggest story in the world.
[00:43:42.855 --> 00:43:49.157]  The criminal conduct of Hillary Clinton threatens the foundations of democracy.
[00:43:49.217 --> 00:43:49.617]  I mean that.
[00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:57.836]  I proposed a contract with the American voter that will give the government back to the people.
[00:43:58.356 --> 00:43:59.737]  I'll tell you, I love our country.
[00:44:00.078 --> 00:44:00.838]  I had to do it.
[00:44:01.198 --> 00:44:04.401]  I see where our country is going and it's not good.
[00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:11.706]  I want everyone in Washington to hear and to heed the words I'm about to say.
[00:44:12.627 --> 00:44:13.248]  If we win,
[00:44:14.187 --> 00:44:24.706]  On November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C., and we, together, are going to drain the swamp.
[00:44:25.646 --> 00:44:30.530]  A constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.
[00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:35.714]  A lifetime ban on government officials lobbying for a foreign government.
[00:44:35.734 --> 00:44:36.474]  Can you believe this?
[00:44:37.115 --> 00:44:41.918]  A total ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.
[00:44:42.018 --> 00:44:43.659]  Thank you very much, we don't need your money.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.822]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership, another beauty.
[00:44:47.813 --> 00:44:52.116]  The deal Hillary Clinton called the gold standard, and then during the debate she lied.
[00:44:52.136 --> 00:44:53.276]  She said, I never said that.
[00:44:53.917 --> 00:44:56.518]  Unfortunately, at the next debate they announced she did say it.
[00:44:57.679 --> 00:45:02.562]  And she also said she never was Secretary of State when they talked about the red line in the Senate.
[00:45:03.102 --> 00:45:05.484]  I wasn't Secretary of State then, right?
[00:45:05.624 --> 00:45:06.044]  Remember?
[00:45:06.664 --> 00:45:10.647]  I wasn't... She lied, she was.
[00:45:11.383 --> 00:45:13.145]  What a group of people we have.
[00:45:13.185 --> 00:45:16.829]  What a group of dishonest scum we have, I'm telling you.
[00:45:17.369 --> 00:45:19.932]  You vote for her, you're crazy, okay?
[00:45:21.934 --> 00:45:22.975]  She is the worst.
[00:45:23.316 --> 00:45:27.620]  My plan also includes major investments in space exploration.
[00:45:27.921 --> 00:45:30.403]  Things come out of it, including great jobs.
[00:45:31.383 --> 00:45:35.008]  And it'll change very quickly under a Trump administration.
[00:45:35.408 --> 00:45:48.705]  As a cornerstone of my policy, we will substantially expand public-private partnerships to maximize the amount of investment and funding that is available for space exploration and development.
[00:45:49.145 --> 00:46:03.831]  Under a Trump administration, Florida and America will lead the way into the stars and appoint justices to the Supreme Court of the United States who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[00:46:04.551 --> 00:46:08.873]  Republicans have to finally get smart and come together.
[00:46:09.353 --> 00:46:11.714]  This is our last chance.
[00:46:12.135 --> 00:46:14.216]  This is bigger than me or any of us.
[00:46:14.356 --> 00:46:15.616]  It's about our country.
[00:46:15.796 --> 00:46:29.723]  I invite all Americans, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, first-time voters, to join this incredible movement, a movement the likes of which has never been witnessed in this country before.
[00:46:29.883 --> 00:46:30.303]  Never.
[00:46:30.944 --> 00:46:31.284]  Never.
[00:46:32.645 --> 00:46:33.986]  Never been anything like this.
[00:46:34.766 --> 00:46:36.147]  Let's not blow it, folks.
[00:46:36.267 --> 00:46:36.947]  November 8th.
[00:46:37.508 --> 00:46:38.829]  Get out sooner if you can.
[00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:47.593]  It's a movement powered by our love for America and our love for our fellow citizens.
[00:46:47.633 --> 00:46:49.094]  We're in a divided country.
[00:46:49.434 --> 00:46:51.095]  We're going to bring everybody together.
[00:46:51.636 --> 00:47:00.641]  I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.244 --> 00:48:52.724]  I don't know.
[00:49:04.542 --> 00:49:05.462]  Rigged election?
[00:49:05.762 --> 00:49:07.463]  What does that even mean?
[00:49:07.803 --> 00:49:10.423]  Well folks, I think we are about to find out.
[00:49:10.483 --> 00:49:25.687]  Now we're already getting reports from residents in at least two cities just here in Texas that are complaining that they voted a straight Republican ticket and then they're seeing the voting machine switch their ballots over to the Democrats when it comes to the President and the VP pick.
[00:49:25.707 --> 00:49:33.949]  So people, you've got to check your ballots, take a video of it, take a picture, and make sure you double check it before you hit submit because
[00:49:34.349 --> 00:49:36.630]  Frankly, I think that this is just the beginning.
[00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:41.432]  Margaret Howell, what else are you seeing from voters out there?
[00:49:41.452 --> 00:49:48.295]  Well, people have every right to feel concerned because we've covered this, the massive voter fraud, massive rigging aspect.
[00:49:48.775 --> 00:49:50.496]  We talked about the machines yesterday.
[00:49:51.056 --> 00:49:52.657]  And people have every right to be concerned.
[00:49:52.677 --> 00:49:54.959]  There was an article that came out in the Washington Examiner.
[00:49:55.399 --> 00:50:02.123]  Four in ten people, only four out of ten, actually have confidence in our system that their vote's going to be counted accurately.
[00:50:02.183 --> 00:50:03.764]  She suggested take a photograph of it.
[00:50:04.224 --> 00:50:05.065]  Might not be legal.
[00:50:05.165 --> 00:50:06.025]  Do it anyway.
[00:50:06.105 --> 00:50:07.846]  Hillary can get away with all those emails.
[00:50:08.107 --> 00:50:09.668]  Rigging the vote's not legal either.
[00:50:09.948 --> 00:50:10.568]  Seriously.
[00:50:10.588 --> 00:50:14.390]  But I would just go ahead and take a picture of it because it might come down to this, Leigh-Anne.
[00:50:14.731 --> 00:50:15.951]  People, they've heard it.
[00:50:15.991 --> 00:50:17.432]  They know Donald Trump is right.
[00:50:17.492 --> 00:50:19.093]  He's warning about this rigged election.
[00:50:20.094 --> 00:50:20.414]  I think so.
[00:50:36.568 --> 00:50:39.190]  An estimated 5 million voters across the U.S.
[00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:40.551]  have already cast these ballots.
[00:50:40.692 --> 00:50:46.436]  And something really disturbing, so there's voter fraud or election fraud on different levels.
[00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:47.657]  We've seen it in the machines.
[00:50:48.118 --> 00:50:52.041]  We've seen it, you know, with people miscounting or switching the ballots entirely.
[00:50:52.441 --> 00:51:01.929]  Something that was really disturbing to me that came out on my Twitter feed, there was a disgruntled postal worker who said, I love my job because I get to rip up Trump's absentee ballots.
[00:51:02.009 --> 00:51:03.550]  Well, that's a felony buster.
[00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:05.932]  So people have every right to be concerned.
[00:51:06.292 --> 00:51:08.394]  Take a photograph, it might just come down to it.
[00:51:08.614 --> 00:51:15.141]  Right, and of course people taking those voter registrations and then just throwing away anyone that was trying to register as a Republican.
[00:51:15.201 --> 00:51:25.812]  So I mean, just on all fronts we have people attacking our free and fair elections and then if you bring it up, you're mocked for it and called a conspiracy theorist who's threatening our democracy.
[00:51:25.872 --> 00:51:26.632]  How dare you!
[00:51:27.293 --> 00:51:29.876]  But see, they're already kind of prepping us all for that because U.S.
[00:51:29.916 --> 00:51:37.723]  officials are, of course, putting out this spin already that the Russians are going to put a bunch of fake documents online and fake videos.
[00:51:37.763 --> 00:51:41.206]  And so that's why, you know, personally, you've got to do it on your own Facebook page.
[00:51:41.466 --> 00:51:41.667]  Right.
[00:51:41.887 --> 00:51:42.828]  So that people know.
[00:51:43.528 --> 00:51:46.692]  You're not a Russian agent putting out these fake documents.
[00:51:46.732 --> 00:51:52.198]  Aren't you sick and tired of hearing the Russians blamed without any proof, mind you?
[00:51:52.218 --> 00:51:57.784]  Hillary Clinton has been doing this for weeks on end, indicting the Russians for hacking the DNC.
[00:51:57.804 --> 00:51:59.025]  There's no proof of that.
[00:51:59.525 --> 00:52:05.472]  So in the event that Trump and Norpoth is right, Trump is going to steal this overwhelmingly
[00:52:05.792 --> 00:52:06.933]  We put this up on InfoWars.
[00:52:06.953 --> 00:52:09.395]  87% he thinks in favor of Trump.
[00:52:09.695 --> 00:52:11.457]  We're going to see this mass popular vote.
[00:52:11.777 --> 00:52:14.059]  In the event that that happens, can't you see the headline already?
[00:52:14.079 --> 00:52:15.540]  She's going to blame it on the Russians.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.281]  Those bad old Russians over there.
[00:52:17.302 --> 00:52:18.703]  Exactly.
[00:52:18.743 --> 00:52:21.585]  Well then they'll believe that the entire thing is rigged.
[00:52:21.625 --> 00:52:23.607]  And what a dangerous precedent they're setting here.
[00:52:23.947 --> 00:52:31.373]  It's not as if it's going to stop with this election, that they're going to just blame anything that they don't like on the Russians, or that those emails have been doctored.
[00:52:31.793 --> 00:52:39.896]  Disregard whatever has been revealed and all the corruption that's been, what we've seen behind the curtains with these revelations.
[00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:40.777]  Ignore that!
[00:52:41.097 --> 00:52:42.397]  It's the Russians, it's hacked.
[00:52:42.858 --> 00:52:44.878]  Don't need to do any further investigating on this.
[00:52:44.939 --> 00:52:48.040]  And of course, our fourth estate is just being very compliant with that.
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:57.063]  And it's going to be very interesting at the polls because what we're seeing is just total electricity behind Donald Trump and his fans.
[00:52:57.384 --> 00:53:00.245]  People are like lining up by the tens of thousands.
[00:53:01.165 --> 00:53:03.486]  12 hours ahead of time, trying to get in to see him.
[00:53:03.567 --> 00:53:12.271]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has to throw concerts or hijack a Fourth of July picnic in order to get a crowd.
[00:53:12.291 --> 00:53:12.791]  That's pathetic!
[00:53:12.811 --> 00:53:14.132]  Is this Tim Kaine the same thing?
[00:53:14.252 --> 00:53:18.074]  In Florida today, 30 people showed up at a Tim Kaine rally.
[00:53:18.134 --> 00:53:21.296]  Nobody cares about poor little old weird Tim Kaine.
[00:53:21.356 --> 00:53:23.197]  It's like, I'm embarrassed for him, you know.
[00:53:23.297 --> 00:53:25.518]  I felt embarrassed for him.
[00:53:25.558 --> 00:53:26.739]  Seriously, the poor guy.
[00:53:27.479 --> 00:53:27.960]  30 people?
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:30.662]  I mean, it's like, and that echoes Clinton.
[00:53:30.682 --> 00:53:32.904]  You know, she can't pull a crowd either.
[00:53:32.924 --> 00:53:37.868]  And paying people, planting people in the audience, hiring actors, you name it, she's done it.
[00:53:38.269 --> 00:53:41.091]  She can't get anybody to show up because people hate her.
[00:53:41.471 --> 00:53:49.018]  And her slogan, which is hilarious, you know, you've got these celebrities coming out saying, you know what, we understand that you hate her.
[00:53:49.318 --> 00:53:50.959]  Please go vote for her anyway.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.541]  She's not coming to your house.
[00:53:53.081 --> 00:53:54.601]  You don't want to have her over for dinner?
[00:53:54.922 --> 00:53:57.262]  Just go vote for her anyway, even though you can't stand her.
[00:53:57.282 --> 00:54:05.204]  Yeah, you don't have to like her, you just have to let her run your country and the laws that you live by and everything that's going to have all the control over your life.
[00:54:05.564 --> 00:54:07.505]  No, sorry, wrong.
[00:54:07.585 --> 00:54:16.947]  If you have bad feelings about someone, bad premonition, or you can see that they're already engaged in a lot of corrupt activity, you might not want to cast your ballot for that person.
[00:54:17.267 --> 00:54:19.568]  You might want to trust your butt on that.
[00:54:19.969 --> 00:54:23.591]  It's sad, it's not funny, but it's hilarious.
[00:54:23.871 --> 00:54:38.180]  In 65 media elites, we've learned this from the WikiLeaks dump, that 65 media personalities were high up, you know, meeting, taking these secret meetings with Clinton, trying to spin the narrative, taking the narrative directly from Clinton, going, how can we get you elected?
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.201]  How can we make you seem personable and likable?
[00:54:40.481 --> 00:54:41.342]  They can't do it!
[00:54:41.382 --> 00:54:42.602]  They fail miserably!
[00:54:42.622 --> 00:54:46.885]  I imagine like an army of staff members there trying to figure out how to make this woman likable.
[00:54:47.185 --> 00:54:50.627]  I mean, hello, does that not say something to you?
[00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:51.267]  Anything?
[00:54:51.787 --> 00:55:01.352]  And of course, it's really shocking to me that even though she does have this army of staff and all of the celebrity endorsements and Madonna saying, hey, I'll give you oral sex if you vote for her.
[00:55:01.392 --> 00:55:02.452]  Oh, there's an endorsement.
[00:55:02.593 --> 00:55:06.575]  Probably, you know, she made a lot of people vote for Trump with that, so maybe it was good.
[00:55:07.115 --> 00:55:14.238]  But I mean, even with all of that, she still can't get any electrified, real, honest support for her.
[00:55:14.318 --> 00:55:15.579]  It's just, it's insane.
[00:55:15.859 --> 00:55:16.940]  Not to mention the money.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.542]  Let's point out the fact Trump, he wasn't spending nearly the money Clinton was spending on ads.
[00:55:22.562 --> 00:55:23.943]  She's almost a billion dollars.
[00:55:24.043 --> 00:55:24.763]  Isn't that crazy?
[00:55:24.823 --> 00:55:29.625]  She can't even clinch this with all the money, all the celebrity, all the media elites.
[00:55:29.985 --> 00:55:31.506]  People still can't stand her.
[00:55:32.026 --> 00:55:35.328]  And oh, by the way, she might try to rig the election, her and her little cronies.
[00:55:35.688 --> 00:55:35.908]  Right.
[00:55:36.068 --> 00:55:39.150]  And then what was really interesting, we see Michael Moore.
[00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:44.653]  Now, we know Jill Stein, who's very brave, coming out talking to me, much more brave.
[00:55:44.693 --> 00:55:53.758]  We haven't seen Gary Johnson speak out, say anything, but she's saying, you know, listen, if Trump wins, we might not sleep as good at night, but if Hillary Clinton wins, World War III, without a doubt.
[00:55:54.018 --> 00:55:54.839]  She said it's evil.
[00:55:55.239 --> 00:55:56.540]  She said it to Infowars, Leigh-Anne.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:02.303]  She got on camera and she said, look, if you vote for Hillary Clinton, you are voting to go to war with Russia.
[00:56:02.423 --> 00:56:03.404]  Hands down.
[00:56:03.424 --> 00:56:06.565]  We will be in war with Russia when Clinton gets into office.
[00:56:07.026 --> 00:56:08.226]  And a lot of people feel that way.
[00:56:08.266 --> 00:56:17.071]  What's interesting to me, though, Bill Bradley, I think that's his name, Senator Bradley in Ohio, released this ridiculous ad claiming that Trump would start nuclear war.
[00:56:17.111 --> 00:56:18.072]  It's hilarious.
[00:56:18.092 --> 00:56:20.853]  It's like, buddy, you got that backwards a little bit.
[00:56:20.893 --> 00:56:24.015]  He's not the one inciting violence and provocation with Russia.
[00:56:24.315 --> 00:56:24.515]  Right.
[00:56:24.635 --> 00:56:29.838]  And what I've kind of been saying from the beginning with at least with Trump, everyone's like, well, you don't know what you're going to get.
[00:56:29.898 --> 00:56:31.879]  You know, he's he's his temperament.
[00:56:31.939 --> 00:56:37.302]  And it's like, no, at the very least, we are going to shake this whole entire system.
[00:56:37.342 --> 00:56:38.502]  And that's exactly what we need.
[00:56:38.522 --> 00:56:45.786]  That's the hashtag drain the swamp is kind of going around because people truly believe Donald Trump's going to get in there and and be the you're fired candidate.
[00:56:46.086 --> 00:56:51.068]  And now Michael Moore is saying Trump's election will be the biggest FU in history.
[00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:53.770]  It will blow up the whole system.
[00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:57.392]  And this is Michael Moore, who's like a major leftist.
[00:56:57.552 --> 00:57:02.536]  You know, it's not as if he thinks Trump is some great guy, but he's saying, look, the voters are going to decide.
[00:57:02.956 --> 00:57:13.404]  And it's it's the people on the streets, the people who are getting totally screwed over by these systems, who are out of jobs, who can see what's been happening to this country and who knows they've been being lied to.
[00:57:14.084 --> 00:57:19.008]  And they're ready for someone like Trump to come in and just shake the etch-a-sketch.
[00:57:19.568 --> 00:57:23.129]  You know, speaking of how badly people are hurting in this country, jobs.
[00:57:23.289 --> 00:57:28.070]  The job creation rate under Obama, we know that it's inflated.
[00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:29.550]  He's not actually creating any jobs.
[00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:32.831]  People are choosing between health care and food under him.
[00:57:32.851 --> 00:57:37.432]  78% increase in welfare benefits in the past 10 years, this is under him.
[00:57:37.772 --> 00:57:39.273]  People are really hurting.
[00:57:39.333 --> 00:57:40.873]  They don't realize.
[00:57:41.393 --> 00:57:43.274]  Hillary Clinton seems so out of touch.
[00:57:43.294 --> 00:57:48.875]  She doesn't realize how badly people are hurting under these failed policies, and they're just going to continue under her.
[00:57:49.415 --> 00:57:56.376]  Well, and the thing that's also just a huge slap in the face is they knew from the start that Obamacare was doomed to fail.
[00:57:56.476 --> 00:57:58.197]  It was going to be terrible for the voters.
[00:57:58.637 --> 00:58:02.877]  They were going to get raked when it came time to pay the premiums.
[00:58:03.077 --> 00:58:05.458]  They've brought in billions of dollars in the penalties.
[00:58:05.838 --> 00:58:08.318]  So they knew that the American voter was going to get screwed.
[00:58:08.798 --> 00:58:12.219]  Out in public, Hillary Clinton is praising the Affordable Care Act.
[00:58:12.259 --> 00:58:17.840]  And then we see from WikiLeaks, back in 2015, she's saying, I'm OK for it to unravel.
[00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:26.607]  But basically supporting it in the meantime to get more people signed up, more people involved in the system, rather than just saying, you know what, this isn't working, we need to fix this.
[00:58:26.947 --> 00:58:30.050]  And that's even more people with this open enrollment.
[00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:39.498]  More people are going to be getting screwed and that's just more evidence that you cannot trust this woman because are you getting public Hillary or private Hillary?
[00:58:40.218 --> 00:58:40.919]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:58:40.959 --> 00:58:42.279]  Well, Margaret, thank you so much.

[00:59:10.396 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
