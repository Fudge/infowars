[00:00:00.899 --> 00:00:03.508]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:21.306]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a big, big broadcast yet again today.
[00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.871]  IMF cuts world growth forecast for the third time.
[00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:55.394]  We're going to get into the divide and conquer going on and the race baiting here in the United States.
[00:00:55.414 --> 00:00:58.876]  We've got two big guests coming on as well today.
[00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:03.458]  Obama eyes audacious use, that's his words, of executive power in final year.
[00:01:03.478 --> 00:01:04.779]  It's all coming up.
[00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.861]  But first, who will lead the UN to world domination?
[00:01:10.287 --> 00:01:15.609]  The race to be the Secretary General of the United Nations is clandestinely underway.
[00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:23.853]  The second term of current Secretary General, former South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon, comes to an end on December 31st, 2016.
[00:01:24.613 --> 00:01:33.477]  Today's United Nations has mutated from its supposed noble peacekeeping 1945 birth under FDR's United Nations Charter.
[00:01:33.837 --> 00:01:37.519]  And I am confident that the congressly American people
[00:01:38.563 --> 00:01:41.221]  We'll accept the results of this conference.
[00:01:42.313 --> 00:01:45.434]  As the beginnings of a permanent structure of peace.
[00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:52.957]  Into a New World Order antagonizing behemoth, waiting in the wings to crush the sovereignty of nations across the globe.
[00:01:53.317 --> 00:02:09.684]  So who will lead the criminally immune New World Order's IMF-backed intergovernmental planetary organization, emboldened by the rollout of the Department of Justice's handover of local police to the United Nations Global Police Stasi Convolution via the Strong Cities Network?
[00:02:09.924 --> 00:02:33.422]  Or the final word afforded it by Obama's unconstitutional Trans-Pacific Partnership, where, for example, scenarios such as these will begin to be played out as The Atlantic reported, a Vietnamese company that owns 15 restaurants in San Francisco files a lawsuit saying that the pay increase violates the investor protection provisions of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, recently approved by Congress.
[00:02:33.642 --> 00:02:39.066]  The lawsuit is not in a federal or state court, but instead will be heard by three private arbitrators,
[00:02:39.206 --> 00:02:41.748]  The United States government is the sole defendant.
[00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:47.652]  Who will drop the United Nations green agenda-fueled hammer continuing Obama's war on coal?
[00:02:47.913 --> 00:02:51.455]  Who will be the one to ramp up the initiatives of Agenda 21?
[00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:57.660]  Who will be the face of the New World Order's final rollout as the curtain is finally lifted?
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.444]  Quite possibly one of the usual New World Order dupes of a New World Order.
[00:03:02.944 --> 00:03:06.805]  Barack Obama, Tony Blair, Angela Merkel, or Bill Clinton?
[00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:11.286]  Rumors of Barack Obama's interest have already created rumblings abroad.
[00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:23.208]  The Kuwaiti daily Al Jareeda report that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has heard the rumor and is recruiting the Persian Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain.
[00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:27.129]  New allies in fear of Iran to cut the president off at the pass.
[00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:36.718]  The Jerusalem Post reports that its sources close to Mr. Netanyahu do not deny the speculation that the Prime Minister aims to torpedo the Obama project.
[00:03:36.858 --> 00:03:49.911]  These friends say Mr. Netanyahu thinks Mr. Obama's presidency has been characterized by moving closer to the Muslim Brotherhood, toppling the regime of Hosni Mubarak, and by attempts to ally himself with political Islam.
[00:03:50.191 --> 00:04:10.422]  Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who stepped down last year as a UN representative to the Middle East Quartet of Special Mediators from the US, EU and Russia, is now on the United Nations list of candidates, along with former United States President Bill Clinton, who has been drooling over the United Nations Secretary General position for well over 10 years.
[00:04:10.803 --> 00:04:16.606]  The latest candidate to long for greener totalitarian pastures is German Chancellor Angela Merkel,
[00:04:16.866 --> 00:04:30.969]  Under heavy fire for the glaring rape of Germany by hordes of protected jihadist refugees, Merkel now says that she does not want to complete her full term as German Chancellor, and is planning to resign before elections due in 2017.
[00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:41.712]  The German leader is aiming to become the first Chancellor to leave of her own accord since 1949, and is interested in a new role as United Nations Secretary General.
[00:04:41.912 --> 00:04:45.233]  or president of the EU, Spiegel Magazine reported.
[00:04:45.513 --> 00:05:03.077]  The global banker stooge the United Nations General Assembly installs will join the ranks of past UN Secretary Generals including Nazi war criminal Kurt Waldheim and Egypt's Boutros Boutros Ghali, the man responsible for supplying weapons for the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
[00:05:03.417 --> 00:05:07.558]  As the clock ticks nearer to midnight, John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:05:09.847 --> 00:05:23.454]  A declassified email sent on April 2, 2011 to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reveals the invasion of Libya was launched to prevent Muammar Gaddafi from establishing a pan-African currency based on Libya's gold.
[00:05:23.794 --> 00:05:25.955]  According to the document posted on the U.S.
[00:05:25.995 --> 00:05:33.799]  State Department website, advisors to the second son of Gaddafi told sources the Libyan government held 143 tons of gold and a similar amount of silver
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.341]  We're good to go!
[00:05:53.504 --> 00:05:57.027]  Analysts argued Gaddafi planned to stop selling oil in U.S.
[00:05:57.067 --> 00:06:00.110]  dollars and demanded instead it be traded in gold.
[00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.394]  Prior to the invasion, Gaddafi urged other African and Middle Eastern nations to follow suit.
[00:06:05.555 --> 00:06:09.298]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:06:09.538 --> 00:06:13.902]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[00:06:14.162 --> 00:06:18.787]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:06:18.928 --> 00:06:19.949]  Talk about the effects.
[00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:21.751]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:23.393]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:06:23.693 --> 00:06:24.774]  I feel like I look better.
[00:06:24.814 --> 00:06:25.475]  I feel better.
[00:06:25.535 --> 00:06:26.616]  I feel sexier.
[00:06:26.937 --> 00:06:27.317]  I love it.
[00:06:27.557 --> 00:06:30.481]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:06:30.541 --> 00:06:33.224]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:06:33.464 --> 00:06:34.485]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:06:34.525 --> 00:06:35.566]  Consult your physician.
[00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:37.927]  Visit Infowarslife.com today.
[00:06:38.087 --> 00:06:39.028]  This is life changing.
[00:06:39.468 --> 00:06:40.229]  Shower filters.
[00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:41.970]  We're introducing the best yet.
[00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.033]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high performance shower filter.

[00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:13.066]  Secret 12, Infowars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:07:13.306 --> 00:07:19.428]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:07:19.628 --> 00:07:26.589]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:35.761]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:41.969]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:45.333]  Methocobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and
[00:07:45.573 --> 00:07:46.393]  We're good to go.
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:27.988]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:34.793]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:46.385 --> 00:09:02.571]  Coming up in the second hour today, former member of the Central Intelligence Agency, operator in war zones, you name it, not just an analyst, Robert David Steele will be joining us to break down the state of the world, the election.
[00:09:03.592 --> 00:09:08.974]  He thinks there's evidence of false flag connections to some of these latest jihad attacks.
[00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:18.133]  We have Dr. Edward Group joining us, because so many friends, family, neighbors have asked me, why is there such a crisis in fertility?
[00:09:18.793 --> 00:09:31.984]  And we have a lot of research on that, but there's also known compounds naturally occurring and deficiencies in things that have handled, even with all the chemical bombardment we're under, have been shown to be able to boost fertility.
[00:09:32.748 --> 00:09:35.529]  So we're going to talk about fertility in the third hour.
[00:09:35.569 --> 00:09:43.393]  In the fourth hour, Anthony Guciardi will have Dr. Group back in to cover a bunch of other subjects and news and take your phone calls.
[00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:45.094]  Leanne McAdoo.
[00:09:46.266 --> 00:09:55.213]  Has a report on the situation up in Michigan with the tainted water that's now been turned into another race-baiting issue by the Democrats.
[00:09:56.074 --> 00:10:02.419]  Regular suspects Hillary Clinton and Michael Moore, Jesse Jackson, the Reverend Jackson and others.
[00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:07.603]  And then we will also have Jakari Jackson pop in.
[00:10:07.643 --> 00:10:10.125]  I was already planning to cover this, but he's done a lot of research into it.
[00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:12.768]  It's now come out in documents, what we already knew.
[00:10:14.195 --> 00:10:25.627]  That Gaddafi was taken out because he was creating a pan-African currency not controlled by the globalists and was giving almost all the oil money actually directly to his people.
[00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:40.128]  I'm not for socialism because it creates dependency, but he was taking the state money and giving it directly to the people for education, for building projects, and for real infrastructure, and was actually a stabilizing force in Africa, so he was taken out.
[00:10:40.648 --> 00:10:43.148]  Same reason the South African apartheid was taken out.
[00:10:43.449 --> 00:10:44.449]  Now, it was an evil.
[00:10:45.222 --> 00:10:55.615]  But it was replaced because the globalists came in and took it over and they admit in mainline metrics South Africa is three times worse poverty crime-wise than it was just 20 years ago.
[00:10:55.955 --> 00:10:57.678]  They are just enslaving everybody now.
[00:11:00.046 --> 00:11:08.768]  The public's so ignorant, they didn't even know that it was different African tribes fighting each other in the ANC and the Zulus, and then you got the Dutch against the British.
[00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:16.449]  I mean, they just literally tune in to different Hollywood movies about South Africa and have no idea how that even ran or worked.
[00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:18.669]  No idea.
[00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:20.590]  Absolutely zero.
[00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:27.151]  And now it is hell on earth, because you better watch out what you're getting rid of and what you're asking for, historically.
[00:11:28.163 --> 00:11:33.512]  So, we're going to look at the takedown of Africa in a big, big, big way.
[00:11:33.552 --> 00:11:36.117]  And the globalists want to do that here as well.
[00:11:36.557 --> 00:11:41.065]  They want to control us and make us all poor so they can dictate control over us as well.
[00:11:42.188 --> 00:11:44.149]  Now, let's just look at the facts here.
[00:11:44.950 --> 00:12:00.080]  Before I get to all these huge pieces of world news, economic news, Donald Trump news, massive radical Islamic invasion news, the raping, the attacking, the bizarre behavior, more attacks in the U.S., more attacks in Canada, more attacks in Europe.
[00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:07.745]  The answer by Twitter, Facebook, and governments is to ban just any criticism of the open borders.
[00:12:08.446 --> 00:12:10.007]  It is simply amazing.
[00:12:11.357 --> 00:12:15.878]  But there are a lot of stories that if you understand them, open up the wider world.
[00:12:16.599 --> 00:12:19.680]  They're what I call Rosetta Stones, or through the looking glass.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:37.285]  And one of those is this situation that we followed the last few weeks up in Michigan, where the old industrial cities, because of NAFTA and GATT predominantly, that's over 90% of the reason, all economists agree, I mean it's not debatable,
[00:12:38.854 --> 00:12:46.422]  There's a massive flight out of Michigan the last 30 years to the South and to the West.
[00:12:47.122 --> 00:12:48.564]  And that's what's going on right now.
[00:12:49.665 --> 00:12:54.450]  People are demographically moving where there's lower taxes, where it's warmer, and where the jobs have gone.
[00:12:55.953 --> 00:13:00.097]  And they're also starting to leave the West to a great extent and come towards the center of the country.
[00:13:00.857 --> 00:13:02.819]  So that's demographically happening.
[00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:20.074]  It has nothing to do with racism as Hillary, Michael Moore, Jesse Jackson, Sharpton, all of them are running around saying that the water system is breaking down and the water system is screwed up because the town of Flint, Michigan and surrounding area is 60% black.
[00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:28.394]  Let's expand on that.
[00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.639]  Because that is such a whopper of a statement.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:46.011]  In the last 20 years, there's been a globalist movement, not just here but all over the world, where foreign multinationals come in, they get the federal governments of the nations to pass laws
[00:13:47.068 --> 00:14:11.500]  And then once laws have been passed, and once laws have been put into place, upping the quote water quality rules, that all these chemicals have to be added, that all these new processes have to be added, then that bankrupts the old county and city water districts, and the multinationals come in and say, we'll add the new systems in,
[00:14:13.996 --> 00:14:19.897]  And then we will basically monitor and run and own the systems from that point out.
[00:14:20.277 --> 00:14:21.698]  And then they do the same thing all over the world.
[00:14:21.718 --> 00:14:24.058]  This has been well adjudicated, well reported on.
[00:14:24.078 --> 00:14:25.259]  It's come out in court.
[00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:36.321]  They then control the lobbying process at the state and federal level, come back in and change regulations again, and then let the big complex expensive systems basically break down.
[00:14:38.171 --> 00:14:41.033]  And then give people basically the worst water they had before.
[00:14:41.573 --> 00:14:47.136]  An example of this is Austin, Texas, where hundreds of millions of dollars a year is spent messing with our water.
[00:14:47.877 --> 00:14:51.539]  We have the Edwards Aquifer we sit on, some of the best water in the world.
[00:14:52.199 --> 00:14:54.081]  We have all these other big reservoirs.
[00:14:54.721 --> 00:14:56.222]  It's got to be lightly treated.
[00:14:56.502 --> 00:14:57.563]  And folks, they don't do that.
[00:14:57.643 --> 00:15:00.905]  They jack with it big time because
[00:15:02.256 --> 00:15:03.198]  It's a giant scam.
[00:15:03.418 --> 00:15:05.281]  Not just for the chemical companies that are getting money.
[00:15:05.861 --> 00:15:07.924]  Over a million bucks a year just to fluoridate Austin water.
[00:15:09.212 --> 00:15:14.097]  But to the special interests that make all the money off administrating and running it for the city.
[00:15:14.437 --> 00:15:15.598]  So it's one of the biggest scams.
[00:15:15.658 --> 00:15:19.221]  It's like toll roads taking over the roads, jacking up the prices, all the rest of it.
[00:15:19.241 --> 00:15:20.302]  It's been well documented.
[00:15:20.903 --> 00:15:26.829]  And so you have a giant screw job against everybody taking over the water, messing with it.
[00:15:26.849 --> 00:15:30.432]  I've had a lot of water experts, a lot of water managers on the show.
[00:15:30.892 --> 00:15:32.134]  Two years ago I was up in
[00:15:34.175 --> 00:15:49.183]  The great town of Hot Springs, Arkansas, where I vacationed off and on since I was a child, staying at the Arlington Hotel, and they had a big city convention for wastewater treatment engineers from all over the U.S.
[00:15:50.143 --> 00:15:59.466]  And I got mobbed, I talked about this at the time, by listeners who were engineers and water treatment workers, but it was mainly the bosses saying, you're totally right.
[00:16:00.087 --> 00:16:08.350]  And I talked to folks right there from Arkansas, because the big issue that year was they'd passed a state law saying you must fluoridate because all these towns were pulling it out.
[00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.151]  And I sat there constantly, I mean I couldn't be left alone by them, which is fine,
[00:16:13.373 --> 00:16:19.520]  Talking to these wastewater managers saying, listen, the water here, we sit on top of the giant, you know, Ozarks aquifers.
[00:16:19.881 --> 00:16:23.125]  It's totally crystal clear, totally delicious, some of the best water in the world.
[00:16:23.445 --> 00:16:25.468]  They bottle it and sell it around the planet.
[00:16:25.828 --> 00:16:26.629]  Everybody knows that.
[00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.011]  Some of the best water in the world.
[00:16:29.707 --> 00:16:33.069]  I mean, you talk millions of year old water under these volcanoes.
[00:16:33.489 --> 00:16:34.510]  That's what the Ozarks are.
[00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:35.750]  It's a bunch of extinct volcanoes.
[00:16:36.271 --> 00:16:41.693]  And we take it and we put chlorine and fluoride and all these other chemicals into it.
[00:16:42.074 --> 00:16:42.814]  It's crazy.
[00:16:43.034 --> 00:16:47.557]  And I had one guy tell me from a small town, he goes, listen, my kids drink that water.
[00:16:47.597 --> 00:16:53.360]  He goes, we take that stuff and we dump it down an old cemented well so it doesn't get into the well water.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.322]  We do not put it into the water supply.
[00:17:00.768 --> 00:17:06.892]  So, that's also what's going on quietly, and when the yearly test comes through with the feds or whatever, they sit there and jack with the studies.
[00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:14.918]  So, there's also a secret revolution going on at water treatment plants, where they're actually just trying to get rid of the toxic waste and not dumping it in the water.
[00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:24.946]  So, it's just amazing that this is happening, and then it turns into... I mean, we hear about chemical spills, algae blooms,
[00:17:26.227 --> 00:17:30.808]  In West Virginia, in Tennessee, in Ohio, in California.
[00:17:31.989 --> 00:17:34.890]  Constantly because these water systems are so complex.
[00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.251]  And because there's so much toxic waste and runoff getting into the water.
[00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:40.732]  I mean it's a nightmare situation.
[00:17:40.932 --> 00:17:44.973]  And in many areas they don't have enough water, so they are having to heavily treat runoff and things.
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:55.443]  And having to treat sewage, toilet to tap, where they take the sewage and then process it and take the water out in many areas of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and then you drink that.
[00:17:56.163 --> 00:18:00.624]  So it's a complex issue that I've tried to study and I don't even fully understand.
[00:18:00.664 --> 00:18:04.285]  But let me tell you, you think the governor wants people to tell him to resign?
[00:18:04.345 --> 00:18:11.267]  You think they really have the water system breaking down and we're directing the river in for people to drink and then try to treat that?
[00:18:13.168 --> 00:18:14.689]  Because they want to hurt people?
[00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:25.316]  The truth is they're a bunch of dumb politicians that follow orders and don't even run the state of Michigan that's being looted and being totally controlled.
[00:18:26.717 --> 00:18:35.863]  And so this is a great example of political correctness that I'm going to be, this week, really getting into the history of and going over where it comes from in the Soviet Union, what it's designed to do.
[00:18:36.283 --> 00:18:40.426]  That's what the word correctpolitik basically comes out of the communist system.
[00:18:43.345 --> 00:18:43.525]  Yes.
[00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:07.896]  All the things that are being put in the water and the radioactive isotopes, but instead he says this is a racial killing.
[00:19:08.297 --> 00:19:09.958]  Flint, Michigan is 60% black.
[00:19:10.499 --> 00:19:16.065]  When you knowingly poison a black city, you're committing a version of genocide.
[00:19:16.925 --> 00:19:17.886]  And they're saying that
[00:19:18.806 --> 00:19:24.889]  They put this river water in that they know the acidity of will leach stuff out of pipes.
[00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:29.952]  Do you have any idea what's in pipes that have had treated water for 60 years going through it?
[00:19:30.192 --> 00:19:33.274]  The fluoride, the heavy metals, the radioactive isotopes.
[00:19:33.554 --> 00:19:41.058]  You can go to any major municipal water facility and stick a Geiger counter or a field meter up to it.
[00:19:41.098 --> 00:19:41.779]  We've done this.
[00:19:41.839 --> 00:19:47.242]  It's been on national news and it's just 10, 15, 20 times the radioactivity it should be.
[00:19:48.393 --> 00:19:52.735]  Just type in radioactivity and water supplies and you'll get local reports from all over the country.
[00:19:53.195 --> 00:19:54.355]  But there's no discussion about that.
[00:19:55.136 --> 00:19:59.417]  So yes, pumping river water through those filthy pipes is poisonous.
[00:19:59.918 --> 00:20:02.118]  But what were they supposed to do when there's no water?
[00:20:02.399 --> 00:20:04.219]  You're already getting poisoned water.
[00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:08.181]  It's all a big joke covered up by cries of racism.
[00:20:11.069 --> 00:20:12.549]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.950]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:19.152]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[00:20:19.372 --> 00:20:27.855]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[00:20:28.195 --> 00:20:31.476]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:35.439]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:40.104]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:45.090]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:48.594]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[00:20:48.954 --> 00:20:51.176]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[00:20:52.037 --> 00:20:58.280]  Please go to IDStronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:04.322]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[00:21:04.662 --> 00:21:06.363]  It is as though the protection is free.
[00:21:07.023 --> 00:21:08.644]  Visit IDStronghold.com today.
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.762]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[00:21:13.062 --> 00:21:15.664]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[00:21:15.684 --> 00:21:16.124]  Croix River.
[00:21:16.445 --> 00:21:18.446]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[00:21:18.666 --> 00:21:21.408]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[00:21:21.628 --> 00:21:22.149]  His excuse?
[00:21:22.509 --> 00:21:23.590]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.131]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:30.955]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[00:23:16.126 --> 00:23:20.227]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.

[00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:40.385]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:23:40.405 --> 00:23:41.885]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:23:42.185 --> 00:23:43.486]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:23:43.846 --> 00:23:46.166]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:23:46.666 --> 00:23:48.507]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:23:48.967 --> 00:23:53.007]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:23:53.467 --> 00:23:57.168]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[00:23:57.408 --> 00:24:00.849]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[00:24:01.189 --> 00:24:01.589]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[00:24:01.609 --> 00:24:02.929]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:24:56.005 --> 00:24:59.106]  This is not a natural disaster.
[00:24:59.146 --> 00:25:01.086]  This is not a mistake.
[00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:04.787]  They hid this from the federal government.
[00:25:05.247 --> 00:25:15.170]  And in doing so, they knew that the people here did not have the political power to do anything about it.
[00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.410]  The people of Flint have been betrayed.
[00:25:18.651 --> 00:25:20.371]  They assumed they could drink the water.
[00:25:21.144 --> 00:25:24.786]  Bathe in the water, wash in the water, and have clean air.
[00:25:24.806 --> 00:25:27.747]  It seemed to be a man-made disaster.
[00:25:27.767 --> 00:25:30.329]  It was a man-made disaster.
[00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:32.530]  There are legal and political consequences to that.
[00:25:34.531 --> 00:25:38.434]  Absolutely, and I'm sure your foundation will end up getting some money, Jesse Jackson.
[00:25:38.854 --> 00:25:42.016]  No discussion of why we're run by multinational foreign companies.
[00:25:42.356 --> 00:25:48.921]  No discussion why the Great Lakes are being sucked dry by giant Chinese water ships that then take it back to China.
[00:25:49.441 --> 00:25:58.167]  No discussion about how they're trying to put water meters on people's wells in Michigan, but letting all these big multinational companies take all the water they want.
[00:25:58.447 --> 00:25:59.548]  Same thing in California.
[00:25:59.828 --> 00:26:04.171]  Same thing in places like the Ozarks in Arkansas.
[00:26:05.432 --> 00:26:10.595]  Because the people don't know how the world works, they're not organized, and they're all busy fighting with each other.
[00:26:12.196 --> 00:26:22.422]  I mean, every couple weeks there's a new water crisis, and when it's in rural, white West Virginia, you don't hear it because it's racist.
[00:26:23.223 --> 00:26:27.805]  Or when a giant coal slurry breaks and browns a bunch of people, you don't hear it because it's racist.
[00:26:28.266 --> 00:26:30.467]  That's what happens in an industrialized world.
[00:26:31.428 --> 00:26:33.389]  Whole rivers catch on fire in China,
[00:26:35.103 --> 00:26:37.205]  Factories blow up and kill thousands of people.
[00:26:37.245 --> 00:26:39.607]  Do you hear it's because racism did it?
[00:26:39.907 --> 00:26:43.471]  No, it's because it's a communist dictatorship that cares less about human life.
[00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:45.472]  And America is rotting.
[00:26:46.233 --> 00:27:00.966]  And everywhere the Democrats run things, like Flint, Michigan, and Detroit, and Chicago, and New York, and D.C., you got the rich part of town that's little bitty, and then the big, giant, sprawling... I mean, you look at areas in Philadelphia,
[00:27:01.747 --> 00:27:07.329]  A few years ago when I was there, it looks worse than any third world country I've ever seen, and I've been in Honduras.
[00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:09.390]  I've been in Guatemala.
[00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:15.332]  And let me tell you, they're some of the worst in Latin America, and it's nothing compared to some of these U.S.
[00:27:15.372 --> 00:27:15.712]  cities.
[00:27:18.313 --> 00:27:22.214]  And it's just, again, everything becomes racism.
[00:27:22.234 --> 00:27:23.275]  Melissa Harris Perry
[00:27:24.755 --> 00:27:31.459]  He's out talking about Trump and Cruz saying, we're getting run over by China and others like we're amateurs.
[00:27:31.959 --> 00:27:36.041]  You know, like, like, you know, Obama, since they're negotiates like a child.
[00:27:36.801 --> 00:27:41.524]  Well, that's a standard assault on someone that's doing a bad job is to say they're an idiot.
[00:27:41.564 --> 00:27:42.645]  They act like a child.
[00:27:44.105 --> 00:27:47.107]  But see, she says, oh, that's calling a black man, a boy.
[00:27:47.127 --> 00:27:54.231]  And I guess with that, you could claim in some alternate universe, maybe, maybe a 1%, but what about.
[00:27:56.428 --> 00:27:59.529]  Paul Ryan's a really hard worker and the Democrats really need him.
[00:27:59.689 --> 00:28:00.490]  Now, you be quiet!
[00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:05.172]  That's taking away from black slaves that were hard workers and say that, oh, this white guy's a hard worker.
[00:28:05.372 --> 00:28:06.412]  See how she attaches?
[00:28:06.432 --> 00:28:07.933]  Because that's a pretty cloud.
[00:28:08.133 --> 00:28:09.713]  Oh, you like it because it's white, don't you?
[00:28:10.534 --> 00:28:10.734]  No.
[00:28:10.754 --> 00:28:14.855]  And it's to create total mental illness.
[00:28:16.356 --> 00:28:18.277]  Total mental illness.
[00:28:22.281 --> 00:28:23.381]  And then she goes on the TV.
[00:28:23.422 --> 00:28:26.343]  She didn't even say what they actually said, saying he's a child.
[00:28:26.583 --> 00:28:27.503]  He acts like a child.
[00:28:28.164 --> 00:28:29.444]  She just said, did you hear him?
[00:28:29.984 --> 00:28:32.986]  Coming up, the Republicans called Obama a boy.
[00:28:33.006 --> 00:28:35.287]  The clip's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:36.887]  Everybody's like, a boy!
[00:28:37.648 --> 00:28:38.488]  My gosh!
[00:28:38.508 --> 00:28:39.949]  Because everybody's seen Roots.
[00:28:40.329 --> 00:28:42.370]  Yeah, and I've had the author of Roots on.
[00:28:44.096 --> 00:28:45.817]  It's the author of Color Purple that's a listener.
[00:28:46.277 --> 00:28:47.017]  I don't know anymore.
[00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:48.298]  I'm losing my mind.
[00:28:49.659 --> 00:28:56.542]  I know what political correctness is, and I'm going to do a special video this week showing the history of it, the documents.
[00:28:56.582 --> 00:29:06.867]  I did a Facebook mention before the show today just going over it, but it is an admitted communist system of balkanization
[00:29:08.351 --> 00:29:16.995]  Of deindustrialization, of turning people into gibbering idiots who don't know how to be competent at business or social skills or anything.
[00:29:17.195 --> 00:29:20.897]  They're just experts at being offended and experts at hating language.
[00:29:21.157 --> 00:29:24.218]  It's the opposite of liberalism, the opposite of renaissance.
[00:29:24.358 --> 00:29:25.579]  It is a curse!
[00:29:26.779 --> 00:29:33.742]  And the poor people of Flint, NAFTA and GATT passed bipartisanly, is the biggest reason your infrastructure is collapsing.
[00:29:33.942 --> 00:29:37.524]  There's not as many people, what, maybe 20% of the people that were there 30 years ago?
[00:29:38.832 --> 00:29:43.018]  So you got this big, giant, jalopy, complex water system.
[00:29:44.139 --> 00:29:46.663]  With all the government regulations, it's falling apart.
[00:29:47.184 --> 00:29:47.865]  It breaks.
[00:29:48.265 --> 00:29:49.146]  There's no money.
[00:29:49.447 --> 00:29:51.470]  You start getting the river water and filtering it.
[00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:53.552]  There's a bunch of complaining about that.
[00:29:55.069 --> 00:29:56.011]  I mean, what are you going to do?
[00:29:56.071 --> 00:29:57.073]  It's all collapsing.
[00:29:57.113 --> 00:29:58.074]  It's what you wanted!
[00:29:58.094 --> 00:30:00.098]  The unions wanted Naff-N-Gatch!
[00:30:01.139 --> 00:30:03.403]  You wanted Obamacare!
[00:30:03.463 --> 00:30:05.868]  You want Death Panel!
[00:30:06.268 --> 00:30:07.470]  You want open borders!
[00:30:07.671 --> 00:30:08.793]  You want fluoride!
[00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:19.585]  Serving as a microcosm of the Obama administration, a real estate developer partially demolished the reputed birthplace of the Bill of Rights.
[00:30:19.885 --> 00:30:29.951]  The developer, Triple Crown Corp., secured a permit to demolish a two-story stone building, formerly known as James Bell Tavern, in Silver Springs Township, Pennsylvania.
[00:30:30.191 --> 00:30:39.097]  By the time a third of the building was destroyed, the city stopped the demolition because officials realized the Bill of Rights was conceived at the tavern during a 1788 meeting.
[00:30:39.117 --> 00:30:39.557]  Commenter W.C.
[00:30:39.577 --> 00:30:41.119]  Handy wrote to the local Sentinel newspaper.
[00:30:49.204 --> 00:30:52.589]  We have a Congress that is so intent on destroying the Bill of Rights.
[00:30:52.849 --> 00:30:57.715]  The building as it stands now is rather indicative of the current state of our Bill of Rights.
[00:30:58.036 --> 00:31:02.402]  Why not leave the building as it is to serve as a reminder to us all, he added.
[00:31:02.642 --> 00:31:05.786]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:31:09.793 --> 00:31:11.154]  I want more candy!
[00:31:11.174 --> 00:31:11.914]  I want more video games!
[00:31:12.115 --> 00:31:12.215]  Why?
[00:31:12.235 --> 00:31:12.295]  Why?
[00:31:12.475 --> 00:31:12.755]  Why?
[00:31:39.793 --> 00:31:40.573]  I think so.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.943]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:32:14.103 --> 00:32:18.066]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[00:32:18.246 --> 00:32:23.029]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[00:32:42.842 --> 00:32:47.586]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:32:47.826 --> 00:32:49.487]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:32:49.527 --> 00:32:51.008]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:32:51.128 --> 00:32:54.351]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:32:54.611 --> 00:32:56.412]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:32:56.592 --> 00:32:57.493]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:32:57.513 --> 00:32:58.453]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:32:58.734 --> 00:33:00.635]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[00:33:34.361 --> 00:33:36.163]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:36.583 --> 00:33:37.344]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:37.364 --> 00:33:41.567]  We're now 33 minutes and 30 seconds into this global worldwide broadcast.
[00:33:41.987 --> 00:33:47.432]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars Nightly News Reporter and co-host of this show is with us for this segment.
[00:33:47.732 --> 00:33:51.996]  Then Jakari Jackson pops in in the next two segments to get into a really important
[00:33:52.276 --> 00:33:54.477]  Report that's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:33:54.917 --> 00:33:58.899]  It's confirmed Libya was invaded to prevent Pan-African currency.
[00:33:59.299 --> 00:34:04.661]  State Department email reveals Qaddafi had seven billion in gold and silver for the purpose.
[00:34:05.402 --> 00:34:09.383]  He tried to work with the West, brought in Western companies, they set him up.
[00:34:09.984 --> 00:34:13.745]  So regardless what you think about Muammar Qaddafi, this is really evil thing to do.
[00:34:13.805 --> 00:34:16.466]  Then they put Al-Qaeda in after that, Jakari's coming up.
[00:34:16.807 --> 00:34:19.408]  By the way, Leanne McAdoo and David Knight tomorrow
[00:34:20.285 --> 00:34:20.445]  I don't
[00:34:42.097 --> 00:34:44.018]  And the people wonder why it's so toxic.
[00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:45.099]  It's crazy.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:48.121]  It's on, even local newscasts admit this.
[00:34:48.682 --> 00:34:57.268]  Even the famous dentist that helped get Canada fluoridated 30-something years ago has come out in the last decade and said, I thought we were putting calcium fluoride in that you do need a little bit of.
[00:34:58.587 --> 00:35:11.337]  In fact, I've gone before and bought, before we were actually producing it ourselves, I call it nutraceuticals, these big mass mineral systems at Whole Foods, and you would see in there that it would say calcium fluoride, a very small amount.
[00:35:11.637 --> 00:35:17.381]  And I brought that to my dad, who's a chemist, also a physician, and he said, no, no, son, you need a little bit of calcium fluoride.
[00:35:17.402 --> 00:35:18.923]  And of course, I knew that 20 years ago.
[00:35:19.423 --> 00:35:19.963]  We're good to go.
[00:35:35.686 --> 00:35:36.066]  Well, sure.
[00:35:36.126 --> 00:35:47.790]  I mean, they won't ban hydrofluorosilicic acid, which is obviously fluoride, but they want to get rid of dihydrogen monoxide because it sounds scary, and that, of course, is water.
[00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.070]  So we're going to lean in here in just a moment.
[00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:56.392]  First off, folks, we have a huge special running today.
[00:35:56.552 --> 00:36:04.475]  I was going to have another special on liver shield that's been sold out for months, but
[00:36:06.912 --> 00:36:08.292]  It's not going to be here until next week.
[00:36:09.813 --> 00:36:16.074]  But regardless, we're doing another special that's just as good, and your purchases make this whole broadcast possible.
[00:36:16.455 --> 00:36:25.177]  That's Survival Shield X2, the TrueNation Iodine, and Super Male Vitality, or Super Female Vitality, 15% off this week only.
[00:36:25.457 --> 00:36:27.557]  And Super Female Vitality was sold out for months.
[00:36:27.938 --> 00:36:28.998]  It's now back in stock.
[00:36:29.038 --> 00:36:31.619]  And folks, go read the 4.8 reviews.
[00:36:34.441 --> 00:36:36.482]  On survival shield x2.
[00:36:36.562 --> 00:36:37.722]  Nobody else has got that.
[00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:41.463]  Go read the almost five-star reviews on super metal vitality.
[00:36:42.764 --> 00:36:49.265]  And know that regardless your purchase funds the operation, but these really are amazing products that have changed my life and so many others.
[00:36:49.285 --> 00:36:50.046]  Go read the reviews.
[00:36:50.086 --> 00:36:52.746]  Go read about the information the research behind it.
[00:36:52.786 --> 00:36:54.287]  Find out why these are so special.
[00:36:55.791 --> 00:37:00.896]  Again, for this week only, it's Survival Shield X2 and Super Mel Vitality, 15% off at ForrestLife.com.
[00:37:01.276 --> 00:37:05.740]  These are the two most essential products from Forrest Life that I recommend and use daily.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:14.949]  Both X2 and Super Mel Vitality have thousands of five-star reviews, and over 90 of the reviewers say they would recommend these products to a friend.
[00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:21.452]  Now is the time to stock up on X2 and Super Mel Vitality and InfoWars Life for 15% off.

[00:37:24.533 --> 00:37:28.755]  Also, the all-new ProPure shower filter has arrived.
[00:37:29.135 --> 00:37:32.317]  The ProMax four-stage shower filter has super fast flow rate.
[00:37:32.657 --> 00:37:35.800]  The probe here is now available exclusively at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:36.981]  I should add exclusively.
[00:37:37.301 --> 00:37:49.611]  In a limited first run, PRO-MAX reduces or removes over 200 contaminants from shower water, including heavy metals, VOCs, pesticides, fluorides, chlorine, pharmaceuticals, and odors.
[00:37:49.971 --> 00:37:55.956]  PRO-MAX is made from BPA-free plastic, is easy to install, and has a filtration capacity of up to nine months.
[00:37:56.297 --> 00:38:00.320]  We looked at hundreds of different shower filters, and this is the best we could find for the lowest price.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.822]  Visit Infowarsstore.com and get the new Promax shower filter today.

[00:38:11.166 --> 00:38:23.113]  And by the way, getting into this Flint crisis with the usual suspects of Obama, Hillary, Michael Moore,
[00:38:24.361 --> 00:38:31.487]  Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, running around saying this is racism because Flint's 60% black.
[00:38:32.128 --> 00:38:41.236]  You can print up a stack last year of white areas that have deadly, predominantly white areas in rural West Virginia, you name it.
[00:38:41.636 --> 00:38:44.619]  Deadly algae killing people.
[00:38:44.679 --> 00:38:46.801]  They can't get rid of it for a year.
[00:38:46.821 --> 00:38:48.702]  You know, deadly
[00:38:49.443 --> 00:38:54.769]  What about the EPA blowing up dams and flooding stuff with cyanide?
[00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:56.912]  Look, the government's out of control.
[00:38:57.252 --> 00:38:59.275]  Rivers set on fire in China every week.
[00:38:59.575 --> 00:39:00.896]  Black smog everywhere.
[00:39:00.977 --> 00:39:01.437]  Poison.
[00:39:01.697 --> 00:39:03.399]  That's Chinese screwing over Chinese.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.263]  It's a corrupt, breaking down system.
[00:39:06.943 --> 00:39:08.045]  And they add.
[00:39:09.153 --> 00:39:18.618]  Hundreds of chemicals in what they call fluoride waste from heavy metal plants, from aluminum smelting plants, and from fertilizer production plants.
[00:39:18.658 --> 00:39:24.981]  And they take the toxic waste and they call it lawn fertilizer or they call it fluoride.
[00:39:25.042 --> 00:39:25.982]  That's the big scandal.
[00:39:26.422 --> 00:39:30.785]  And they put toxic waste, industrial waste, in the water.
[00:39:31.105 --> 00:39:34.787]  At the end of World War II they had just incredible amounts.
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:39.622]  of toxic waste left over from nuclear weapons, uranium purification.
[00:39:40.402 --> 00:39:47.585]  There's whole films and books, we've had the experts on, remember they flooded whole parts of Tennessee, thousands died, black, white, it was terrible.
[00:39:49.206 --> 00:39:54.528]  Because they were just dumping the toxic waste in the rivers, they said, wait, we'll just call it fluoride and put it in the water.
[00:39:54.808 --> 00:39:58.990]  It reduces fertility, it dumbs people down, the physical IQ is dropped, just Google.
[00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.991]  Harvard admits
[00:40:02.878 --> 00:40:06.061]  Fluoride causing IQ reductions in cancer.
[00:40:06.401 --> 00:40:13.507]  You got the government saying, take half of it out of the water, from 1.3 to what, 7 parts per million, or 0.7.
[00:40:14.668 --> 00:40:16.289]  We have to do this, folks.
[00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:21.033]  There's the Harvard study, Impact on Fluoride Neurological Development in Children.
[00:40:21.053 --> 00:40:22.174]  20 plus studies in that one alone.
[00:40:22.554 --> 00:40:31.782]  So I'm ranting here because it is so frustrating to have won the Info War and have all the major, when I say all, they had almost every.
[00:40:32.868 --> 00:40:37.831]  FDA and EPA toxicologists and scientists in 2000 write a letter to their bosses.
[00:40:37.851 --> 00:40:43.315]  I mean, it was literally 99% of them saying, with their union, take this out of the water.
[00:40:43.495 --> 00:40:44.655]  They did it again three years ago.
[00:40:44.716 --> 00:40:49.138]  I've had Dr. Conant that worked with them, the head of his university department in toxicology.
[00:40:50.339 --> 00:40:51.640]  A doctorate in toxicology.
[00:40:53.373 --> 00:40:56.594]  He comes to Austin, the mayor laughed at him in his speech.
[00:40:57.234 --> 00:40:58.754]  Oh, here's the Harvard studies, here's our studies!
[00:40:58.874 --> 00:40:59.715]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:40:59.775 --> 00:41:00.155]  It's so funny.
[00:41:00.355 --> 00:41:09.557]  They're poisoning all of us, they write the book Ecoscience, admitting they're doing this to all of us, and their answer is to look us straight in the face and say racism.
[00:41:09.937 --> 00:41:21.560]  Because now, these complex water plants, that's the thing, they do boondoggles with all this complex water filtration, even on good spring water, even on aquifer water in many cities, and then they dump poison in it after.
[00:41:23.715 --> 00:41:24.796]  Now, you think about that.
[00:41:25.656 --> 00:41:28.497]  But it's so much easier just to say, we're getting screwed over.
[00:41:28.537 --> 00:41:29.298]  Listen, I agree.
[00:41:29.498 --> 00:41:30.498]  I think running water's great.
[00:41:30.558 --> 00:41:32.439]  I think having local systems running is wonderful.
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.581]  But whatever happened to filtering your own water?
[00:41:35.821 --> 00:41:38.542]  Whatever happened to people hauling water up from the well?
[00:41:39.283 --> 00:41:40.303]  Of course we're slaves.
[00:41:40.523 --> 00:41:44.646]  We're being supplied water by government, and now multinationals came in, bought it out, and control it.
[00:41:44.986 --> 00:41:51.929]  Leanne McAdoo has put together a powerful six-minute report today that was going to be airing on the nightly news tonight, and it still will.
[00:41:52.209 --> 00:41:52.750]  We're going to be
[00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:56.695]  Premiering that here but will also be on with more tonight.
[00:41:56.735 --> 00:42:04.726]  Then she's going to Flint, Michigan this evening or tomorrow morning as soon as we get a flight to cover all of this with David Knight.
[00:42:05.107 --> 00:42:07.430]  Leanne McAdoo, you've heard my rant about this.
[00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:09.413]  What's your view on it before we go to your report?
[00:42:09.713 --> 00:42:17.356]  Well, that's what I think is really important for a lot of people to understand is that you basically have these mad scientists there at the water supply.
[00:42:17.896 --> 00:42:23.658]  They are kind of working with these different tinctures and they're saying, oh, well, that's corrosive, so let's add this agent to it.
[00:42:23.738 --> 00:42:27.680]  No, oh, well, that's going to cause cancer when you mix those two compounds together.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:33.842]  That's pretty much what happened in Sacramento when they, for over a year, they knew that they were mixing this agent.
[00:42:34.302 --> 00:42:37.444]  Once they put this coagulant in the water to kind of bring down those
[00:42:38.584 --> 00:43:01.020]  Toxins that were in the river water they were pulling in it created a cancer-causing Compound and they knew it it was causing miscarriages things like that But they just let it go on for a year same type of thing that's happening here in Flint, Michigan They were messing around with some different compounds to try and take out this notorious Toxic river water so they were mixing different things and it created a
[00:43:02.401 --> 00:43:07.465]  It just caused a huge problem, and they weren't adding an anti-corrosive agent into it.
[00:43:07.725 --> 00:43:20.776]  So it starts eroding all of these old lead pipes, eroding the iron water mains, and it's all going... And the whole time... But beyond that, and the buildup from the old water treatment facility that was adding fluoride in, now that's all built up.
[00:43:20.796 --> 00:43:22.217]  It's kind of like a water filter in your house.
[00:43:22.517 --> 00:43:28.121]  If you let it go too long, suddenly your water tastes horrible, it starts sloughing all the toxins, and it's 20 times worse.
[00:43:28.322 --> 00:43:29.122]  So here's the takeaway.
[00:43:30.356 --> 00:43:51.338]  There is genocide going on against humanity by what they add to the water, but then, when it really starts getting bad, then it becomes a big example and people claim it's racism, when all it is is the precedent set to send poison to us through the water systems, and then it all becomes a distraction that our water is purposely poisoned because now they make it about racism.
[00:43:51.738 --> 00:43:52.259]  Exactly.
[00:43:52.299 --> 00:43:58.905]  It's about racism, classism, so of course that's why Hillary Clinton jumped on this because this could be a political power point for her.
[00:43:59.726 --> 00:44:07.313]  And they're completely ignoring the fact that in Sacramento, or now Stockton, they're planning on using that same agent that was cancer-causing.
[00:44:08.494 --> 00:44:10.396]  Why wasn't anyone outraged about that?
[00:44:10.576 --> 00:44:13.599]  They're only outraged about this because they can point racism.
[00:44:14.019 --> 00:44:16.602]  And like I point out in my report, just like with the
[00:44:17.062 --> 00:44:26.708]  The scandal there with the militarization of the police and police brutality, rather than allowing us to all come together and fight that, they want to make it a race thing, and they're doing the same thing with the water.
[00:44:26.868 --> 00:44:29.210]  Meanwhile, this is happening all over the country.
[00:44:29.949 --> 00:44:33.870]  And again, I'm going to have to skip this network, Bray, because I'm going to play your full report and then come back with Jakari.
[00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:35.171]  So we've got a few minutes left here.
[00:44:35.591 --> 00:44:38.091]  Get into the fact, and of course we're going to do even more reports.
[00:44:38.471 --> 00:44:42.853]  This has happened all over the country in areas that are 60-70% white as well.
[00:44:43.353 --> 00:44:46.754]  We should all come together and say, stop it with the water.
[00:44:47.094 --> 00:44:53.476]  Citizens should get together and go test the water, like folks used to do with the nuclear power plants.
[00:44:53.756 --> 00:44:55.516]  And they kept catching it being radioactive.
[00:44:55.756 --> 00:44:56.957]  We sent Jakari out.
[00:44:58.257 --> 00:45:13.188]  A few years ago, when we knew the radiation levels were up on the West Coast, he found some areas 15 to 20 times regular background radiation with two certified field meters and a Geiger counter, and the media went, oh, you're not radiologists, you don't know.
[00:45:13.468 --> 00:45:18.011]  The Army went out to where we went and said no, it was true, and a big investigation started.
[00:45:18.231 --> 00:45:18.411]  Right.
[00:45:18.451 --> 00:45:22.252]  So, so, I mean, people were catching fish that were 25 times the radiation level.
[00:45:22.552 --> 00:45:26.194]  And then later it came out, okay, we covered up the tuna, it's got high radiation.
[00:45:26.554 --> 00:45:26.714]  See?
[00:45:26.934 --> 00:45:28.294]  Jakari went and did that.
[00:45:28.614 --> 00:45:30.235]  And again, that's his job as a journalist.
[00:45:30.535 --> 00:45:32.035]  Where were all the other journalists?
[00:45:32.415 --> 00:45:32.756]  You see?
[00:45:32.776 --> 00:45:32.816]  So...
[00:45:34.196 --> 00:45:38.859]  Were they dumping nuclear reactors in the 60s and 70s off the West Coast because they don't like black people?
[00:45:39.359 --> 00:45:41.060]  It's because the globalists are crazy!
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.040]  They hate everybody!
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:47.703]  Why did they build 10-plus reactors on fault lines and tsunami lines in Japan?
[00:45:48.224 --> 00:45:49.644]  Why the Japanese government do it?
[00:45:49.664 --> 00:45:50.705]  Because they're anti-Japanese?
[00:45:50.925 --> 00:45:53.046]  They're anti-human, folks!
[00:45:53.146 --> 00:45:54.007]  It's crazy!
[00:45:54.387 --> 00:45:57.629]  And so it's a good thing people are upset about their water, but I want you to go educate them.
[00:45:58.109 --> 00:46:01.790]  I want you guys to print up today, like Harvard Studies, and go, what about the fluoride?
[00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:03.590]  This is what builds up in your pipes.
[00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:05.151]  This is why it's really bad.
[00:46:05.471 --> 00:46:12.612]  Well, and that's the other thing, is that they had a lot of activists this last year, I guess around April, trying to fight to get the fluoride taken out of the water.
[00:46:12.992 --> 00:46:23.855]  So here, the state, the government, they could afford to continue fluoridating the water, but they wouldn't pay $100 a day for this anti-corrosive agent that was now eating all the lead out of the old pipes.
[00:46:24.315 --> 00:46:25.855]  So they keep on fluoridating, but
[00:46:26.235 --> 00:46:27.196]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:46:27.256 --> 00:46:34.340]  Mass industrial water treatment is a giant scam, a big boondoggle, and it's ripping people off.
[00:46:34.721 --> 00:46:36.182]  It isn't protecting the people.
[00:46:36.582 --> 00:46:37.362]  It's a scam.
[00:46:37.623 --> 00:46:40.465]  You've got to filter your own water.
[00:46:40.505 --> 00:46:42.686]  I'm all about mass distribution of water.
[00:46:43.226 --> 00:46:45.968]  But again, in Austin, Texas, we have totally clean water.
[00:46:46.228 --> 00:46:47.389]  There's no reason to treat it.
[00:46:47.769 --> 00:46:48.470]  They still do it.
[00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:52.332]  They got to treat the sewage before they put it back into the lakes.
[00:46:52.693 --> 00:46:53.573]  That's surface water.
[00:46:53.954 --> 00:46:55.975]  And then it filters through the sediment back into the aquifer.
[00:46:56.856 --> 00:47:01.239]  The world, the planet knows how to filter water, not these globalists.
[00:47:01.259 --> 00:47:03.341]  But again, they want the money off of it.
[00:47:03.361 --> 00:47:04.462]  Leanne, here's your report.
[00:47:05.663 --> 00:47:16.952]  President Obama has declared a federal emergency for Flint, Michigan, after a devastating man-made disaster was created by the state, leaving hundreds of thousands of residents there with contaminated drinking water.
[00:47:17.492 --> 00:47:23.517]  Now, all of this happened about two years ago, when the city decided to switch the water supply from Detroit
[00:47:23.837 --> 00:47:29.900]  To the Flint River, which is a tributary that runs through the town, and it's notorious to its residents for its filth.
[00:47:30.341 --> 00:47:35.784]  Now, immediately following this switch, the residents were complaining about the taste, the odor, the appearance of the water.
[00:47:36.184 --> 00:47:41.787]  But state officials kept reassuring them the water was completely safe to drink and that there was nothing to worry about.
[00:47:42.167 --> 00:47:44.689]  But now we know that that was a dangerous lie.
[00:47:45.889 --> 00:47:55.831]  Researchers from Virginia Tech found that the water coming from the Flint River was 19 times more corrosive than the water coming from Detroit, but they weren't treating it with an anti-corrosive agent.
[00:47:56.291 --> 00:48:06.134]  More than half of the homes have pipelines made of lead, which means this corrosive water was now leaching the lead out of the pipes and it was going into these people's homes for more than 18 months.
[00:48:07.694 --> 00:48:13.242]  Little segue here, this anti-corrosive agent would have cost the city about $100 a day.
[00:48:13.703 --> 00:48:18.650]  But instead, I guess they were able to find countless dollars to fluoridate the people's water.
[00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:23.577]  So to them, allegedly stopping cavities is more important than stopping brain damage.
[00:48:23.857 --> 00:48:32.800]  So, 18 months later, in the fall of last year, researchers discovered that the amount of children with above-average lead levels in their blood had doubled.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:44.324]  Now, there is no safe level of lead in blood, but lead poisoning causes brain damage and other neurological health issues, and it's particularly damaging to developing children as well as fetuses.
[00:48:44.864 --> 00:48:50.205]  Now, the city said that they switched the water back to Detroit in October, but it was too late.
[00:48:50.245 --> 00:48:51.606]  The damage was already done.
[00:48:52.006 --> 00:48:56.048]  And there is no telling how long these pipes are going to continue to leak lead.
[00:48:56.548 --> 00:49:04.111]  Now, the Washington Post does a really good job at breaking down visually just how high, above normal, Flint's lead levels really were.
[00:49:04.352 --> 00:49:07.793]  So the EPA considers 5 parts per billion to be safe.
[00:49:08.273 --> 00:49:12.135]  But 90% of the homes in Flint were reporting 27 parts per billion.
[00:49:13.296 --> 00:49:16.757]  10% of the homes in the sample had lead levels much higher than this.
[00:49:17.117 --> 00:49:18.998]  The highest reading registered 13,000 parts per billion.
[00:49:20.979 --> 00:49:25.980]  The EPA considers water to be toxic waste level at 5,000 parts per billion.
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:31.761]  So parents haven't even really seen the long-term effects of what this lead poisoning is going to be doing to them.
[00:49:32.181 --> 00:49:35.382]  All because a state-appointed manager wanted to save money.
[00:49:35.742 --> 00:49:46.264]  They lied to residents for two years, told them the drinking water was completely safe, all they needed to do was just boil the water, and of course now these kids who've been poisoned are going to have to be supported for decades.
[00:49:46.864 --> 00:49:48.144]  And this researcher
[00:49:48.664 --> 00:50:00.973]  She's a Flint area pediatrician, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, and she was actually studying the lead levels in some of Flint's children, and she was the one who actually forced the state to acknowledge this lead problem.
[00:50:01.053 --> 00:50:10.801]  The city tried to discredit her research, taking water samples of their own, saying everything was completely fine, but of course she was able to prove that that wasn't true, and now she's saying that
[00:50:11.181 --> 00:50:15.344]  All of the city's children under six should be treated as exposed.
[00:50:15.725 --> 00:50:18.967]  So that's almost 7,000 children there who are being affected by this.
[00:50:19.387 --> 00:50:22.650]  Now Michael Moore, of course, he's there in Flint.
[00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:24.311]  He's calling it a crime scene.
[00:50:24.811 --> 00:50:28.114]  He's accusing government leaders of intentionally poisoning thousands.
[00:50:28.154 --> 00:50:28.534]  We're good to go.
[00:50:48.487 --> 00:50:59.478]  And of course, you know, this could be the case here in Michigan, but just like the issue of police brutality, they are now trying to divide this and make this a race-class thing.
[00:51:00.138 --> 00:51:02.400]  But this, it has nothing to do with that.
[00:51:02.481 --> 00:51:03.682]  Just take a look at Sacramento.
[00:51:04.022 --> 00:51:10.787]  The city admitted to secretly testing a cancer-causing agent at its main water treatment plant in order to cut costs.
[00:51:11.208 --> 00:51:16.992]  The substances that were forming in the city's drinking water could cause cancer, birth defects, and even miscarriages.
[00:51:17.412 --> 00:51:28.341]  Red flags went up almost immediately for this, but here again, state officials completely ignored that and instead they expanded this water treatment program, even though they knew that there were some issues there with it.
[00:51:28.721 --> 00:51:30.663]  And I've reported on residents in St.
[00:51:30.703 --> 00:51:38.191]  Louis who were told directly by the EPA to not worry about the nuclear material that was leaking out of this landfill.
[00:51:38.731 --> 00:51:45.118]  They said that these radioactive materials that were leaching into the groundwater were heading in an opposite direction from the city.
[00:51:45.758 --> 00:51:52.642]  Meanwhile, the residents had to point out to the EPA that this is the exact part of the underground water where they get their drinking water from.
[00:51:52.783 --> 00:51:54.704]  So it's going to be a huge problem in the future.
[00:51:55.304 --> 00:52:00.587]  And, you know, let's not forget about the EPA who destroyed an entire ecosystem there at the Animas River.
[00:52:00.868 --> 00:52:06.371]  And a lot of residents said that the EPA knew that this would happen if they tried to clean up the mine in such a way.
[00:52:06.831 --> 00:52:09.633]  Some people went as far as accusing the EPA of doing this on purpose.
[00:52:09.633 --> 00:52:09.933]  I think so.
[00:52:30.316 --> 00:52:31.417]  Fertilizer plants.
[00:52:31.697 --> 00:52:34.139]  So this has nothing to do with race or class.
[00:52:34.399 --> 00:52:41.965]  This is disgusting negligence of a system that wants to cut corners and doesn't care about the long-term devastating effects on your health.
[00:52:42.385 --> 00:52:53.033]  It's just more proof that you cannot trust the state to take care of you, look after your best interests, and the only thing that you can do that's truly safe and effective is filtering your own water.
[00:52:54.958 --> 00:52:57.939]  Absolutely incredible job to Leanne and the crew that shot that report.
[00:52:57.999 --> 00:52:59.540]  What a public service announcement.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:04.082]  The headline on that should be, Plan to Protect Flint's Water Discovered.
[00:53:05.122 --> 00:53:07.083]  And everybody should be filtering their own water.
[00:53:07.903 --> 00:53:13.206]  Ladies and gentlemen, the White House science are, in fact, it's in Anthony's office because I was doing a report on it last week in there.
[00:53:13.446 --> 00:53:15.026]  Will somebody run me Ecoscience, please?
[00:53:15.387 --> 00:53:17.748]  It's by the refrigerator, the mini-fridge.
[00:53:17.768 --> 00:53:19.048]  I think it's on top of it.
[00:53:19.068 --> 00:53:21.769]  Where'd I keep my iced tea at?
[00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.950]  Folks,
[00:53:24.249 --> 00:53:27.473]  They said they put fluoride in the water to lower our Q and hurt our fertility.
[00:53:27.714 --> 00:53:29.396]  But see, now they don't care about it so bad.
[00:53:29.456 --> 00:53:32.580]  They just give us really bad poison where it's killing people.
[00:53:33.221 --> 00:53:35.484]  Doesn't kill you 20 years later now or 30 years.
[00:53:35.544 --> 00:53:36.506]  It kills you a year later.
[00:53:37.767 --> 00:53:38.969]  And that's the whole attitude.
[00:53:38.989 --> 00:53:39.630]  So I agree.
[00:53:40.211 --> 00:53:40.631]  You know what?
[00:53:40.671 --> 00:53:41.793]  The governor should resign.
[00:53:43.226 --> 00:53:49.630]  And then, the people above him that wrote books about poisoning us, they should be tried for murder and genocide.
[00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:50.030]  You know what?
[00:53:50.491 --> 00:53:54.413]  I actually agree with Michael Moore, this is genocide, the more I think about it, because that's what it is!
[00:53:56.334 --> 00:53:57.035]  Man, I'm angry!
[00:53:58.516 --> 00:54:00.317]  You read EcoScience, it's free online.
[00:54:00.977 --> 00:54:01.457]  Textbook.
[00:54:02.078 --> 00:54:02.698]  For the government.
[00:54:02.878 --> 00:54:03.679]  PhD level.
[00:54:04.739 --> 00:54:04.980]  Read it.
[00:54:06.541 --> 00:54:10.203]  Don't just type in EcoScience, uh, fluoride in the water to control population.
[00:54:11.817 --> 00:54:19.407]  In fact, I want David Knight to take this and literally shove it in Michael Moore's face and show Michael Moore's armed bodyguards.
[00:54:19.667 --> 00:54:20.368]  Show that too!
[00:54:21.229 --> 00:54:22.451]  These people are hypocrites, man.
[00:54:22.491 --> 00:54:23.612]  I cannot take it anymore.
[00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:25.174]  I'm telling you I'm tired of them.
[00:54:25.535 --> 00:54:27.618]  You know how angry it makes me they're poisoning the water?
[00:54:28.939 --> 00:54:30.200]  And they turn it into some race deal?
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:30.480]  It is.
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:31.381]  It's a human race.
[00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:33.702]  We're all being attacked by the globalists that are psychos.
[00:54:34.423 --> 00:54:35.643]  So it is a racism issue.
[00:54:35.663 --> 00:54:40.687]  It's a tiny group of psychos that love poisoning us, dumbing us down and making us pay for it, against everybody else.
[00:54:41.107 --> 00:54:45.190]  They want us to all fight with each other so that tiny group can control us, and I'm done with it.
[00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:45.670]  Now.
[00:54:47.887 --> 00:54:52.632]  Speaking of tiny groups controlling us and attacking us, we knew this back at the time.
[00:54:53.312 --> 00:55:09.547]  We knew they were mad at Qaddafi spending tens of billions every decade of his oil money, when oil prices were high, to do work projects, water treatment, mining operations, roads, you name it, tapping aquifers so people got good water, building infrastructure all over Africa.
[00:55:09.567 --> 00:55:10.608]  I mean, he's just a hero there.
[00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:14.051]  And so they set him up, took him out, put Al-Qaeda in, now it's a failed state.
[00:55:14.731 --> 00:55:20.855]  And now we have the emails proving that they did not want him to use his 143 tons of gold.
[00:55:21.095 --> 00:55:25.677]  Jakari Jackson filed a report for the radio today on this, and he's really dug into this.
[00:55:25.717 --> 00:55:29.840]  So Jakari, to me this is just smoking gun, but you won't see this on the news.
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:35.642]  Yeah, just like you said, regardless of what you think about Gaddafi, you know, they take the guy out, they put Al-Qaeda in, and it's a failed state now.
[00:55:35.682 --> 00:55:38.963]  Is it really better off than it was when Gaddafi was in charge?
[00:55:38.983 --> 00:55:53.929]  But we see this article from Curt Nemo today, and it has declassified emails sent on April 2, 2011, to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, reveals the invasion of Libya was launched to prevent Muammar Gaddafi from establishing a pan-African currency based on Libya's gold.
[00:55:54.329 --> 00:55:54.609]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:09.378 --> 00:56:10.318]  Very happy about this.
[00:56:10.358 --> 00:56:14.020]  They didn't want him to get on his own currency and be pretty much self-sufficient.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.642]  As you say, he's trying to improve the area in the ways that he can.
[00:56:17.662 --> 00:56:22.844]  Of course, you know, he's done some bad things in the past, but he's trying to move Africa, Libya into a better area.
[00:56:23.084 --> 00:56:31.328]  And he's encouraging other places in Africa, as well as the Middle East, to abandon the French franc and get on his system of the gold-based currency.
[00:56:31.528 --> 00:56:34.611]  Exactly, because if you have control of the currency, you can do anything you want.
[00:56:34.912 --> 00:56:46.424]  They can start trading amongst the African countries and build themselves up, because any IMF or World Bank money they get has to be spent where the IMF and World Bank says, and that's always to boondoggles to their own companies.
[00:56:46.765 --> 00:56:52.171]  These multinationals give Western tax money to themselves, not to Africa, not to Asia.
[00:56:52.671 --> 00:56:53.712]  Not to Latin America.
[00:56:53.792 --> 00:56:56.254]  It's done as political control.
[00:56:56.555 --> 00:56:59.057]  Gaddafi was breaking that control.
[00:56:59.117 --> 00:57:03.982]  Saddam was going to a gold standard and trying to create a pan-Arab currency.
[00:57:04.322 --> 00:57:07.765]  That has also been declassified as the main reason they took him out.
[00:57:08.065 --> 00:57:09.507]  I mean, this is about global government.
[00:57:09.947 --> 00:57:13.769]  Oh yeah, it's complete control, because he has large shares of oil out there.
[00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:15.790]  They said he was going to move away from a U.S.
[00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:17.791]  currency to his own gold currency.
[00:57:17.811 --> 00:57:23.114]  And like you said, when we got off our gold currency here in the United States, that's when things really went off the rails.
[00:57:23.415 --> 00:57:30.679]  He recognizes this, he tries to change it, and everybody says, no, no, no, you're going to stay on this currency, and then eventually led to an attack that we all know here today.
[00:57:30.859 --> 00:57:38.103]  And the worst part is, yeah, he fought back militarily against things he saw that were wrong in the 70s and 80s, and I'm not defending it.
[00:57:38.743 --> 00:57:39.784]  But you can see both sides.
[00:57:39.804 --> 00:57:55.594]  But he came in for eight years to the West, made deals, signed treaties, followed everything, let the U.S., let France, let Europe in, let them build hotels, let them have infrastructure, paid them handsomely, invested his money in Goldman Sachs, did what he was told, said, but I want to build up Africa.
[00:57:55.834 --> 00:57:56.855]  He met with Obama.
[00:57:57.115 --> 00:57:58.136]  He met with Sarkozy.
[00:57:58.436 --> 00:57:59.517]  He thought they were his friends.
[00:57:59.597 --> 00:58:01.698]  He was shocked when they double crossed him.
[00:58:01.858 --> 00:58:03.640]  And he kept saying, why are you bringing al Qaeda in?
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:04.840]  They're going to kill all the blacks.
[00:58:04.961 --> 00:58:05.581]  They're racist.
[00:58:06.181 --> 00:58:08.623]  He said they're going to bring extremists in and invade Europe.
[00:58:09.864 --> 00:58:10.745]  And they came and killed him.
[00:58:12.346 --> 00:58:14.268]  I mean, that is so dastardly.
[00:58:14.288 --> 00:58:15.609]  I mean, I gotta say it.
[00:58:15.649 --> 00:58:18.452]  Qaddafi, compared to our leaders, actually was a good guy.
[00:58:18.472 --> 00:58:22.896]  I'm not saying he was a good guy, but, you know, at least at his older age, he lived in a tent, folks.
[00:58:23.356 --> 00:58:24.618]  They showed his palace.
[00:58:25.038 --> 00:58:28.561]  It looked like something that a, you know, South Austin delionaire would, you know, have.
[00:58:28.601 --> 00:58:29.542]  It was not very fancy.
[00:58:29.963 --> 00:58:31.104]  Little 10-foot wall around it.

[01:00:11.448 --> 01:00:13.670]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:14.231 --> 01:00:17.015]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:23.843 --> 01:00:31.171]  We have a former high-level field operative of the Central Intelligence Agency, Robert David Steele, joining us to cover the waterfront in the next segment.
[01:00:32.112 --> 01:00:34.354]  Dr. Group's coming on to talk about reduced fertility.
[01:00:34.374 --> 01:00:35.676]  You want to know what fluoride does to you?
[01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:36.136]  That's it.
[01:00:36.256 --> 01:00:39.359]  One of the main reasons they add it to the water, according to the White House Science Czar.
[01:00:39.379 --> 01:00:40.300]  It is book eco-science.
[01:00:40.881 --> 01:00:42.042]  Just keep sourcing that for you.
[01:00:42.623 --> 01:00:43.864]  But Jakari Jackson's here.
[01:00:44.165 --> 01:00:45.706]  The full article breaks it all down.
[01:00:46.627 --> 01:00:49.988]  You know, we knew this from our experts, our insiders, folks that knew Gaddafi.
[01:00:50.048 --> 01:00:51.089]  We knew what he was doing.
[01:00:51.449 --> 01:00:56.491]  We knew about the African Union he created that was a counter, you know, to the fact that they used disunity.
[01:00:57.371 --> 01:01:01.993]  But people could sit back and say, Africa's failed because, you know, the people there just are backwards or whatever.
[01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:06.735]  Ladies and gentlemen, Africa 200 years ago was just about like what America was.
[01:01:07.535 --> 01:01:08.696]  And it was Wild Wild West.
[01:01:09.116 --> 01:01:11.097]  There were some civilizations, were some groups.
[01:01:11.337 --> 01:01:13.338]  They got taken out by Western groups.
[01:01:13.778 --> 01:01:22.543]  Colonialists who wanted to keep the level of development down for political control to get resources cheaply and not let people organize.
[01:01:22.783 --> 01:01:26.785]  You read the British East India Company, the Dutch East India Company dispatches from India.
[01:01:27.065 --> 01:01:27.826]  It's the same story.
[01:01:28.186 --> 01:01:29.647]  Same story with the takeover of China.
[01:01:30.427 --> 01:01:36.952]  It's the globalist models done here to a softer respect with the carbon taxes they want to selectively shut down competition.
[01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:42.716]  It's just like with what's happening with the big unions and people wanting higher wages.
[01:01:43.077 --> 01:01:49.401]  Obama affiliated groups with a new higher wage will be given waivers from that and an unfair competition.
[01:01:50.002 --> 01:01:51.343]  So this is how they do it.
[01:01:52.128 --> 01:01:55.050]  And Africa has 100% been suppressed.
[01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:57.031]  It has been played off.
[01:01:57.351 --> 01:02:01.053]  They send in mercenaries to destabilize countries every time people don't play ball.
[01:02:01.293 --> 01:02:02.473]  They kill African leaders.
[01:02:03.014 --> 01:02:05.655]  And now they've been caught doing it with Gaddafi.
[01:02:06.075 --> 01:02:06.996]  What a war crime.
[01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:10.678]  And Hillary has said, you know, that Syria is going the way she wanted.
[01:02:11.018 --> 01:02:15.220]  And the State Department came out last year and said that they've brought peace to Syria, Jakari.
[01:02:16.641 --> 01:02:19.182]  I think they have a completely different definition of peace.
[01:02:19.223 --> 01:02:22.205]  I guess this war is peace is the way they're looking at it.
[01:02:22.225 --> 01:02:24.046]  And of course, Syria is not a peaceful nation.
[01:02:24.066 --> 01:02:27.168]  We can see that by the record number of Syrians fleeing the country.
[01:02:27.328 --> 01:02:30.490]  So if people were safe there in Syria, they wouldn't be leaving.
[01:02:31.011 --> 01:02:35.293]  But the thing that nobody ever wants to talk about when we address places like Syria is how U.S.
[01:02:35.313 --> 01:02:42.979]  foreign policy is a contributor, not the contributor, but a very large contributor to why people want to leave Syria, why people want to leave Yemen, Pakistan.
[01:02:43.039 --> 01:02:44.400]  I would call it the prime driver.
[01:02:45.653 --> 01:02:48.094]  I mean, I'd say it's 80% of it is the whole Western attack.
[01:02:48.354 --> 01:02:48.594]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:49.114 --> 01:02:49.574]  Oh, definitely.
[01:02:49.614 --> 01:02:51.094]  It definitely is quite significant.
[01:02:51.154 --> 01:02:52.535]  But, you know, they never want to address that.
[01:02:52.555 --> 01:02:56.656]  They want to get on TV and say, use more of your tax dollars to help us fix this situation.
[01:02:56.696 --> 01:02:59.816]  But they never want to admit that they're the ones themselves being the U.S.
[01:02:59.836 --> 01:03:02.677]  foreign policy that made the situation the way it is in the first place.
[01:03:02.757 --> 01:03:03.277]  I agree with you.
[01:03:03.297 --> 01:03:03.897]  And it is U.S.
[01:03:03.917 --> 01:03:06.278]  foreign policy because we let the globalists hijack our country.
[01:03:06.318 --> 01:03:10.198]  But it really is, at the end of the day, globalist foreign policy where we get the blame.
[01:03:10.439 --> 01:03:11.199]  But we do deserve it.
[01:03:11.219 --> 01:03:11.799]  We let it happen.
[01:03:12.139 --> 01:03:12.279]  Yeah.
[01:03:12.878 --> 01:03:17.260]  You know, people go out in the streets and say, let's bring everybody here, but nobody wants to be proactive.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.421]  No, bringing people here is a half measure.
[01:03:19.721 --> 01:03:23.362]  You can bring everybody here that you want, that's not going to stop what's going on overseas.
[01:03:23.682 --> 01:03:36.468]  And because you can't criticize the President or even bring up the things that he does, all these things will continue to happen, not just in the Middle East, but in Mexico, where they're running guns down there with Operation Fast and Furious, and many other places all around the world.
[01:03:37.148 --> 01:03:40.669]  And now it's going to be the first woman president.
[01:03:41.489 --> 01:03:43.269]  And I'd love to have a lot of great women as president.
[01:03:43.289 --> 01:03:43.869]  I could care less.
[01:03:44.209 --> 01:03:45.270]  Man, woman, black, white.
[01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:47.030]  Literally, just let them be a patriot.
[01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.991]  But it's going to be, they already say, even Bernie Sanders, you know, criticizes Hillary.
[01:03:51.051 --> 01:03:51.991]  They say he's sexist.
[01:03:52.451 --> 01:03:56.752]  I mean, it's just going to be women in America, not all of them, but a big segment, will do whatever.
[01:03:56.812 --> 01:03:59.093]  They don't care what she does because women are doing it.
[01:03:59.393 --> 01:04:01.233]  That is the dumbest thinking in the world.
[01:04:01.553 --> 01:04:07.296]  Well, it's the same thing with presidential candidates or the president himself, whether it be a Democrat or it's a Republican.
[01:04:07.616 --> 01:04:11.077]  If it's their guy, their guy can do anything that he wants, anytime of the day.
[01:04:11.537 --> 01:04:13.138]  He can gut the Constitution.
[01:04:13.178 --> 01:04:14.619]  He can infringe on your civil rights.
[01:04:14.879 --> 01:04:19.201]  But as long as it's their guy, the Republican, the Democrat, the man, the woman, they can do no wrong.
[01:04:19.441 --> 01:04:19.821]  Exactly.
[01:04:19.841 --> 01:04:26.644]  And folks get confused who are kind of babies to politics when they hear the show over the years going, wait, you used to be against Bush, but now you're against Obama.
[01:04:26.664 --> 01:04:27.465]  You're just against everything.
[01:04:27.485 --> 01:04:27.525]  No.
[01:04:28.834 --> 01:04:29.997]  The globalists have an agenda.
[01:04:30.037 --> 01:04:32.382]  It doesn't matter who you get in office, it just keeps getting worse.
[01:04:32.562 --> 01:04:34.807]  I'm pointing out that we're in a control paradigm.
[01:04:34.828 --> 01:04:35.529]  I mean, it's real simple.
[01:04:36.089 --> 01:04:37.630]  Oh yeah, but people don't understand that.
[01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:49.139]  You know, they'll get tired of Obama, then they'll vote for the Republican or vice versa, and that's how the situation continues because nobody wants to step back and really look that these guys are getting funded by the same people.
[01:04:49.659 --> 01:04:52.822]  Exactly, and so for the first time, Trump is not being funded by these people.
[01:04:52.902 --> 01:04:55.424]  I mean, I hope he's for real if he gets in, but I don't know.
[01:04:55.464 --> 01:04:56.104]  We'll just see.
[01:04:56.605 --> 01:05:03.370]  The main answer is vote with our dollars, vote with our actions, get involved locally, and just stop complying with the globalists because what they're doing is illegitimate.
[01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:05.512]  Jakari Jackson, thanks for reporting on this for us.
[01:05:05.552 --> 01:05:05.812]  Thank you.
[01:05:06.212 --> 01:05:08.012]  That's Sha'Carri Jackson with InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:05:09.753 --> 01:05:15.834]  Several gas stations in Michigan have lowered their gas prices to under $1 per gallon, with one station as low as 78 cents per gallon.
[01:05:15.974 --> 01:05:22.176]  Meanwhile, across the U.S., oil is so plentiful and cheap that at least one buyer said it would actually need to be paid to refine oil.
[01:05:22.316 --> 01:05:32.298]  Flint Hill Resources, a refinery owned by the Koch brothers, said it wants 50 cents a barrel Friday for North Dakota Sour, a high-grade sulfur grade of crude, according to a list price posted on its website.
[01:05:32.458 --> 01:05:35.199]  In comparison, the refinery was paying $13.50 a barrel a year ago and $47.60 in January 2014.
[01:05:35.239 --> 01:05:35.519]  Overall, U.S.
[01:05:35.539 --> 01:05:39.740]  benchmark oil prices have collapsed more than 70% in the past 18 months and fell below $30 a barrel for the first time in 12 years last week.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.621]  West Texas Intermediate was already trading near $29 in New York on Monday.
[01:05:50.964 --> 01:05:56.329]  This will lead to the collapse of major oil companies and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs, meaning economic compression is likely.
[01:05:56.409 --> 01:06:02.655]  In other words, a global oversupply of oil has now reached the point that the market is effectively forcing producers to pay them to give their oil away.
[01:06:02.775 --> 01:06:07.020]  Otherwise, the oil will simply sit in bloated storage facilities or on tankers parked out in the ocean.
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.342]  This is Kent Daniels with InfoWars.com reporting.
[01:06:09.522 --> 01:06:10.402]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:06:10.462 --> 01:06:10.883]  Good, brother.

[01:06:12.984 --> 01:06:14.524]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:06:14.684 --> 01:06:18.726]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:06:18.746 --> 01:06:21.307]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:06:21.347 --> 01:06:23.588]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.

[01:06:36.717 --> 01:06:41.141]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[01:06:41.421 --> 01:06:46.766]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[01:06:46.766 --> 01:06:49.088]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[01:06:49.268 --> 01:07:01.217]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where a stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[01:07:36.316 --> 01:07:41.938]  We put out the daily radio show free with the video and audio feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:49.422]  But it is the members that are paying it forward and helping so many other people see the truth.
[01:07:49.582 --> 01:07:56.265]  And it's PrisonPlanet.tv that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew, the reporters.
[01:07:56.625 --> 01:08:02.233]  You get exclusive HD higher quality, get it first, and then you can download it, share it with friends and family.
[01:08:02.473 --> 01:08:06.659]  It's a win-win, and then you're helping finance to put it out for free to everybody.
[01:08:06.839 --> 01:08:07.800]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:26.256]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:27.718 --> 01:08:29.560]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:08:40.746 --> 01:08:55.737]  We're going to be covering the waterfront in this hour with a guest I've been interviewing off and off the last 10 years, really smart guy, author, researcher, Robert David Steele, former Marine, former CIA case officer, U.S.
[01:08:55.757 --> 01:08:59.519]  spy, hacker, CEO of Open Source Solutions Network, robertdavidsteele.com.
[01:08:59.559 --> 01:09:02.041]  We're going to be talking to him in just a moment.
[01:09:02.461 --> 01:09:05.924]  He is the open source, everything manifesto, transparency, truth and trust.
[01:09:05.944 --> 01:09:09.887]  We're going to be talking to him throughout the hour and about five minutes into the next hour.
[01:09:10.427 --> 01:09:14.090]  But before I go there, let me just hit some more of the headlines we haven't covered yet.
[01:09:14.711 --> 01:09:17.673]  IMF cuts world forecast for third time.
[01:09:18.073 --> 01:09:18.834]  Sky News.
[01:09:19.314 --> 01:09:23.718]  China seen posting lowest economic growth in 25 years.
[01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:25.620]  GDP expected to slow to 6.8.
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:27.741]  That's with their Cook numbers.
[01:09:28.702 --> 01:09:30.103]  Talk about a state-run system.
[01:09:31.244 --> 01:09:33.426]  We have a list of Bernie Sanders' $19.6 trillion tax hikes.
[01:09:37.056 --> 01:09:40.859]  But of course, all the elites will be exempt, and then he'll vote against auditing the Fed.
[01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:46.303]  Supreme Court agrees to hear Texas challenge to Obama's executive action on immigration.
[01:09:46.323 --> 01:09:47.024]  That's a big deal.
[01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:52.168]  GOP elites have blown $65 million on Jeb Bush and his failed campaign.
[01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.110]  He's polling about 3%.
[01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:58.353]  Ron Paul puts out a hardcore article.
[01:09:58.393 --> 01:10:01.556]  He says, is the stage been set for authoritarianism in America?
[01:10:04.598 --> 01:10:05.519]  Davos elites
[01:10:08.021 --> 01:10:18.011]  ...are to debate rising inequity and, of course, to push global tax initiatives where they get the money and then distribute it to the third world, but only distribute it to companies and corporations they control.
[01:10:18.592 --> 01:10:19.733]  That's the inside baseball.
[01:10:20.394 --> 01:10:22.156]  Major snowstorm threatening D.C.
[01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:22.936]  and New York City.
[01:10:23.557 --> 01:10:27.801]  Hillary says it's global warming, so pay her carbon taxes and she'll fix it.
[01:10:28.775 --> 01:10:36.301]  Continuing, Russia says they're to maintain their level of nuclear restraint for national interests.
[01:10:36.361 --> 01:10:47.169]  Russia's national interests dictate the need to maintain its potential in nuclear systems and they're basically not following a bunch of treaties because of the increased militarization on their borders.
[01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:50.991]  That is just some of the news on that front.
[01:10:51.011 --> 01:10:55.232]  Then we have distractions like the Pentagon may demote David Petraeus.
[01:10:55.772 --> 01:11:13.377]  Oh my goodness, because he talked to a biographer and had something in a file cabinet, but Hillary and everybody else is just running around knowing their servers are hacked, doing whatever they want, taking money from dictators to give them weapons, and you know, the Bushes were involved in funding Al Qaeda as well and supporting it and going back to Jimmy Carter.
[01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:15.238]  That's all okay, but let's, you know,
[01:11:15.698 --> 01:11:22.324]  How about we put Martha Stewart back in jail again for stock fraud, but nothing against Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan for all their derivatives.
[01:11:22.404 --> 01:11:25.026]  It's just ridiculous, these sacrificial lambs.
[01:11:26.167 --> 01:11:29.609]  Assailant chanted ISIS before beating a man in New York City.
[01:11:29.649 --> 01:11:32.532]  Yeah, shoot cops in the head in Philadelphia, beat people.
[01:11:32.772 --> 01:11:37.556]  But there's no attacks from the darling little refugees coming in, many of which are ISIS fighters.
[01:11:38.016 --> 01:11:39.698]  Trump says Christianity is under siege.
[01:11:39.878 --> 01:11:40.418]  I want to win.
[01:11:40.518 --> 01:11:41.099]  I always said
[01:11:42.369 --> 01:11:45.091]  Then they're just going to clean the table.
[01:11:45.111 --> 01:11:47.393]  We're going to play the shocking video in the next hour.
[01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:04.630]  But women are told, just don't dress sexually, it's your fault by the feminist.
[01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:07.151]  The exact inverse of what they previously claimed.
[01:12:07.472 --> 01:12:10.193]  German minister urges Merkel to prepare border closures.
[01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:14.156]  Facebook begins Europe-wide campaign against extremist posts.
[01:12:14.537 --> 01:12:17.038]  Reuters, that means criticizing the open borders.
[01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:21.722]  Muslims, practically impossible to integrate into Europe, Czech president says.
[01:12:24.102 --> 01:12:28.924]  Immigrants must improve English in two and a half years or face deportation, says Cameron.
[01:12:29.125 --> 01:12:29.945]  That's a whitewash.
[01:12:30.225 --> 01:12:33.026]  I'm not against all these poor folks from the destabilized Middle East.
[01:12:33.287 --> 01:12:34.907]  Most of them aren't radicals or terrorists.
[01:12:35.127 --> 01:12:35.848]  But here's the deal.
[01:12:36.088 --> 01:12:37.369]  They know some are going to get in.
[01:12:37.569 --> 01:12:38.869]  They know there's going to be more attacks.
[01:12:39.129 --> 01:12:41.090]  And it's being used for civil emergencies.
[01:12:41.351 --> 01:12:44.332]  It's being used to take our freedoms all over the Western world.
[01:12:44.592 --> 01:12:45.052]  Period.
[01:12:45.353 --> 01:12:46.813]  So it's part of a globalist plan.
[01:12:47.193 --> 01:12:48.434]  It's part of the UN plan.
[01:12:48.734 --> 01:12:49.895]  And the migration head
[01:12:50.875 --> 01:12:53.857]  Who admittedly admits it is to balkanize Europe.
[01:12:53.877 --> 01:12:59.160]  You can go read Peter Sutherland's quotes in the Financial Times of London admitting it.
[01:13:00.021 --> 01:13:02.162]  So this is a divide and conquer strategy.
[01:13:02.502 --> 01:13:08.266]  Bring in the groups, the government becomes the totalitarian referee of the whole thing with the refugees.
[01:13:09.716 --> 01:13:10.897]  Also, this is coming up.
[01:13:11.437 --> 01:13:14.938]  President Obama asserts power over waterways.
[01:13:15.038 --> 01:13:15.518]  Remember?
[01:13:15.598 --> 01:13:21.881]  And how it ties into all the breakdown of the water systems and all the dumping in the rivers that they claim is racism.
[01:13:23.102 --> 01:13:25.503]  No, it's anti-human behavior.
[01:13:25.583 --> 01:13:26.463]  It's corruption.
[01:13:26.763 --> 01:13:29.284]  It's a collapse of a rotting infrastructure.
[01:13:29.684 --> 01:13:31.185]  The de-industrialization.
[01:13:31.385 --> 01:13:33.326]  The aftermath of NAFTA and GATT.
[01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:38.172]  I mean, Detroit and Flint are going to totally collapse, people.
[01:13:38.952 --> 01:13:41.873]  And no amount of bailouts are going to fix it, because there is no industry.
[01:13:41.933 --> 01:13:42.433]  It's gone.
[01:13:44.073 --> 01:13:46.254]  Chicago, New York, they're falling apart.
[01:13:48.054 --> 01:13:49.415]  No amount of welfare will fix it.
[01:13:49.955 --> 01:13:51.815]  It's because this country is rotting.
[01:13:53.336 --> 01:13:56.917]  Obama eyes audacious use of executive power in final year.
[01:13:57.157 --> 01:13:58.157]  The Hill newspaper.
[01:13:59.059 --> 01:14:00.620]  They come out and call it audacious.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:07.803]  They throw down the gauntlet of executive power grabs, setting the precedent further for an imperial presidency beyond Barack Obama.
[01:14:07.984 --> 01:14:12.386]  You Democrats that love him acting like a dictator, imagine when we get a Republican.
[01:14:14.007 --> 01:14:15.928]  And I'll be here opposing those tyrannical moves.
[01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:19.890]  I hope you'll be opposing them as well.
[01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:26.213]  We're going to cover the waterfront, what's happening in the Middle East, what's happening with the fact that the West is running ISIS and Al Qaeda, being unmasked.
[01:14:27.369 --> 01:14:32.431]  Robert David Steele has a new book out looking at, were some of these latest Islamic attacks false flags?
[01:14:32.451 --> 01:14:36.132]  Well, they're false flags and they were brought in, protected and allowed to do it.
[01:14:37.053 --> 01:14:38.854]  But does it go beyond that?
[01:14:39.974 --> 01:14:45.396]  I mean, I ask the question, how could there be attacks and then the government that brings them in not get in trouble?
[01:14:45.836 --> 01:14:47.217]  That's a suspension of logic.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:55.402]  Another French false flag, bloody tracks from Paris to San Bernardino, a new book out by Mr. Steele.
[01:14:55.422 --> 01:14:56.942]  We'll get to that at the bottom of the hour.
[01:14:57.542 --> 01:15:02.844]  There's so much I want to get into him with the whole election, what's happening in the world, the factions.
[01:15:02.884 --> 01:15:03.904]  Let me ask you this, Robert.
[01:15:03.924 --> 01:15:05.224]  First, it's good to have you back with us.
[01:15:05.964 --> 01:15:08.525]  Oh, Alex, it's always a treat to be on your show.
[01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:18.066]  Before we go over the map here, you were an actual field guy, you know, in a lot of combat operations, a lot of intelligence gathering operations, all over the Middle East, all over the world.
[01:15:18.086 --> 01:15:24.892]  So you actually are one of those, maybe 5, 6, 7% of them, Ron, correct me, of the CIA that's actually out there in the field.
[01:15:26.193 --> 01:15:28.675]  What do you think about 13 hours?
[01:15:28.896 --> 01:15:30.257]  I mean, obviously there was a stand down.
[01:15:30.577 --> 01:15:31.858]  What do you think about Benghazi?
[01:15:31.878 --> 01:15:32.939]  And then pulling back then,
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.082]  Who are the factions, best you can tell?
[01:15:36.102 --> 01:15:50.693]  I mean, we know it's the Army at the Pentagon against the Navy, but then the Pentagon overall against the CIA, allied with the Defense Intelligence Agency, and then another 14 agencies jockeying for who they're with, who's the NSA with.
[01:15:50.713 --> 01:16:02.021]  I mean, I've got a lot of good sources, you do too, and they say they can't even figure out who's who now, and then it's so corrupt, it's all just about looting and getting funding
[01:16:02.842 --> 01:16:14.559]  And that basically we've been captured by corruption, not some foreign power, but just by the fact that every agency now is just growing like a bloated tick hanging on the near carcass of the West.
[01:16:16.121 --> 01:16:27.348]  Well, Alex, I was one of the first case officers assigned the terrorist target full-time in the 1980s, and I've actually organized a false flag for the CIA.
[01:16:28.448 --> 01:16:29.889]  I mean, I know how this is done.
[01:16:29.949 --> 01:16:30.790]  I know we do it.
[01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:32.751]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[01:16:32.771 --> 01:16:33.211]  I'm sorry.
[01:16:33.231 --> 01:16:34.492]  I'm going to have to skip this network break.
[01:16:34.512 --> 01:16:35.233]  This is so incredible.
[01:16:36.173 --> 01:16:37.134]  First, break that down.
[01:16:37.214 --> 01:16:42.617]  Get into the... A false flag, and there are many different kinds of false flags.
[01:16:42.677 --> 01:16:43.878]  Mine didn't kill anybody.
[01:16:44.738 --> 01:16:52.760]  But a false flag is basically where you simulate a whole chain of events and you basically blame it on someone else.
[01:16:53.341 --> 01:16:58.682]  But it has a desired outcome that is in your favor even if it has nothing to do with ethics or reality.
[01:16:58.702 --> 01:17:04.404]  Sure, if you can't tell us the classified false flag you carried out, can you give us an example of something else that happened like it?
[01:17:05.097 --> 01:17:06.477]  Well, how about 9-11?
[01:17:07.878 --> 01:17:09.958]  How about Charlie Hebdo in Paris?
[01:17:09.998 --> 01:17:19.961]  How about this most recent Paris event in which multiple witnesses identified white, blue-eyed, paramilitary guys actually doing the shooting?
[01:17:20.501 --> 01:17:24.502]  San Bernardino, on national television in the United States.
[01:17:24.562 --> 01:17:26.663]  Two different witnesses said exactly the same thing.
[01:17:27.323 --> 01:17:29.364]  Alex, you and I are on the same wavelength here.
[01:17:29.424 --> 01:17:43.312]  I mean, I really get upset with the fact that most Americans are so out of touch with reality because they get their news from mainstream media, including Rachel Maddow, who has no clue what the actual unemployment rate is in the United States.
[01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:48.895]  And so our citizens are basically under-informed or misinformed.
[01:17:50.115 --> 01:18:05.700]  But there's no question, and by the way, this wonderful book that you mentioned, this was edited by Keith Barrett, and I'm one of about 50 authors in there, including Craig Roberts and Phil Giraldi, two of my heroes.
[01:18:07.221 --> 01:18:10.162]  There's no question, but that San Bernardino and
[01:18:11.322 --> 01:18:19.329]  Both attacks in Paris were false flags, and they're basically doing to France what was done by NATO Gladio to Italy in the 1960s.
[01:18:19.369 --> 01:18:22.851]  Now that's leaked in Italian courts.
[01:18:22.871 --> 01:18:24.332]  The Italian president's gone public.
[01:18:24.353 --> 01:18:25.373]  They're ahead of their Supreme Court.
[01:18:25.774 --> 01:18:29.957]  That's one of the most documented false flag chains ever, other than the Israelis.
[01:18:31.258 --> 01:18:34.680]  So, Alex, you're right, and so is the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
[01:18:34.781 --> 01:18:38.864]  It's now known that Alan Dulles was a massive traitor.
[01:18:39.404 --> 01:18:54.392]  Who single-handedly saved Nazism and promoted fascism in Japan and Italy and Germany, brought the Nazi Hydra to the United States, helped the Nazis move their empire to Argentina and all of their gold and so forth.
[01:18:54.812 --> 01:18:56.834]  So what we have in the United States today
[01:18:57.854 --> 01:18:58.074]  Sure.
[01:19:20.299 --> 01:19:23.082]  I don't want to walk through all that with you, but you've never dropped so many bombshells here.
[01:19:23.322 --> 01:19:24.723]  You organized a false flag.
[01:19:24.783 --> 01:19:25.984]  These are false flags.
[01:19:26.665 --> 01:19:28.186]  The Nazi gold to Argentina.
[01:19:28.547 --> 01:19:30.008]  A lot of that's been declassified.
[01:19:30.048 --> 01:19:31.089]  The public doesn't know it.
[01:19:31.409 --> 01:19:32.831]  Of course they know where to hunt Hitler.
[01:19:32.871 --> 01:19:33.771]  They know where he was living.
[01:19:34.512 --> 01:19:40.618]  You know, my grandfather, you know, lived in Texas and there were just Nazis all over the place when he would go on military bases after World War II.
[01:19:40.638 --> 01:19:46.123]  He was angry about it because they'd shoot their mouths off, you know, and were very arrogant and he'd had a lot of buddies die.
[01:19:46.443 --> 01:20:07.922]  But I just don't think people understand that it's not even a Nazi conspiracy, it's that it's a Nazi system of covert operations that basically was grafted in, 36,000 of them as officers, into academia, into science, into weapons manufacturing, into NASA, into everything, and that's what we see today.
[01:20:08.183 --> 01:20:10.585]  So of course we've got poison water in Flint, Michigan.
[01:20:11.479 --> 01:20:13.421]  Well, it's not just here.
[01:20:13.641 --> 01:20:24.153]  Germany has been a vassal state of the United States since World War II, and Angela Merkel is one of the people that has been funded and promoted by the United States for a very long time.
[01:20:24.453 --> 01:20:25.755]  And she came out of East Germany.
[01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:30.158]  The bottom line here is we cannot trust the U.S.
[01:20:30.218 --> 01:20:30.698]  government.
[01:20:31.058 --> 01:20:33.940]  And by the way, there's no such thing as a monolithic U.S.
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:34.661]  government.
[01:20:34.821 --> 01:20:39.103]  There are millions of very good people trapped in a very bad system.
[01:20:39.504 --> 01:20:40.965]  And you talked about Benghazi.
[01:20:41.005 --> 01:20:46.288]  I've got a master post at Phi Beta Iota on Benghazi and the timeline and so forth.
[01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:49.850]  There are no fewer than seven U.S.
[01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:50.791]  foreign policies.
[01:20:51.764 --> 01:21:06.757]  And in Benghazi, what you had was a CIA operation to destabilize the entire region that Hillary Clinton was actively supporting, in violation of the Constitution, without Congressional authority.
[01:21:07.478 --> 01:21:11.301]  She let an ambassador die because of her irresponsibility.
[01:21:11.641 --> 01:21:15.705]  However, Leon Panetta is the guy who gave the no-go order.
[01:21:16.345 --> 01:21:19.048]  Leon Panetta is a chicken shit with no balls.
[01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:27.213]  And he overturned his military advisors, including the commander for AFRICOM, who could have saved everybody in Benghazi.
[01:21:28.114 --> 01:21:31.717]  For me, this was Panetta's first great act of treason.
[01:21:31.757 --> 01:21:39.342]  His second was the fake bin Laden attack, which killed a number of SEALs to kill a Patsy that was not bin Laden.
[01:21:39.722 --> 01:21:43.244]  It was put into place by Pakistan as a favor to the US government.
[01:21:43.725 --> 01:21:46.186]  And there are some tremendous journalists out there.
[01:21:46.246 --> 01:21:49.449]  I cannot name them right now because they told me in confidence.
[01:21:49.909 --> 01:21:57.514]  But we have Pakistani sources that have confirmed that the fake bin Laden was provided by them.
[01:21:58.174 --> 01:22:00.836]  And Leon Panetta probably knew that.
[01:22:01.276 --> 01:22:04.699]  And of course, it was right by their West Point.
[01:22:05.339 --> 01:22:08.982]  And the word I've been told by SEAL families and SEALs, and this was the week
[01:22:09.902 --> 01:22:10.543]  That it happened.
[01:22:11.024 --> 01:22:15.471]  I mean, I got really scared having this info, obviously, because it was so dangerous, so I got it out immediately.
[01:22:17.239 --> 01:22:20.501]  That they had a body double there, and that's basically what happened.
[01:22:20.922 --> 01:22:24.804]  That's why they then sent 20-something of them in a helicopter to a non-mission.
[01:22:24.824 --> 01:22:30.528]  They knew they were being set up, blew it up, and now I've even had some of those SEAL families on the show since then.
[01:22:30.868 --> 01:22:35.792]  But let me tell you, it's creepy when you meet with a Navy SEAL or you meet with their family a week after it happens.
[01:22:35.852 --> 01:22:38.514]  We've known from the beginning what happened here.
[01:22:38.534 --> 01:22:40.055]  You talk about Hillary's incompetence.
[01:22:41.075 --> 01:22:43.677]  As you said, though, CIA on record with a stand down.
[01:22:44.097 --> 01:22:51.780]  They now have this guy named Bob, the supposed section chief, you know, saying that this new movie, 13 Hours, is wrong about a stand down.
[01:22:52.081 --> 01:22:57.963]  We have the witnesses that were on the ground on the radio getting the stand down order who worked for the CIA.
[01:22:58.164 --> 01:23:04.827]  They were ordered and they go on Fox News with Megyn Kelly and say, no, we got the order from the CIA not to go.
[01:23:05.567 --> 01:23:08.928]  It's not just the CIA, it's everybody, including Hillary Clinton.
[01:23:08.988 --> 01:23:19.712]  I mean, if you look at my timeline, which was developed by a whole bunch of experts, we basically knew seven to nine hours in advance that Benghazi was going down.
[01:23:20.532 --> 01:23:24.573]  And fast movers with tankers were two hours away.
[01:23:25.553 --> 01:23:30.995]  Troops, the counterterrorism team in Spain, were two hours away.
[01:23:31.735 --> 01:23:32.796]  There was no question.
[01:23:33.436 --> 01:23:35.617]  Weren't there jets 20 minutes away?
[01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:37.518]  No, two hours.
[01:23:37.658 --> 01:23:39.760]  Jets were about 20, is what I've read.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:48.304]  I don't know, because jets use a lot of fuel, and if you launch jets from Turkey and these other places, you've really got to refuel them.
[01:23:48.404 --> 01:23:52.347]  There are other complications, but let's say one to two hours was the window.
[01:23:53.567 --> 01:23:56.429]  We held off for seven hours.
[01:23:59.966 --> 01:24:11.980]  Now, knowing what you know as a CIA former guy that ran operations on the ground, how many people do you think, because we know there were predator drones above it, how many people knew it was a lie?
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.264]  About Benghazi?
[01:24:15.404 --> 01:24:15.725]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:16.005 --> 01:24:16.325]  Day one.
[01:24:18.144 --> 01:24:18.625]  It depends.
[01:24:18.705 --> 01:24:27.168]  Part of the problem we have is that the CIA lies to the Pentagon, and the Pentagon lies to CIA, and everybody lies to the Department of State and the White House.
[01:24:28.548 --> 01:24:33.010]  So we have a government in which we literally lie among ourselves.
[01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:34.651]  It's internal warfare.
[01:24:35.931 --> 01:24:39.853]  And one of the problems with Libya, of course, was also the French activism.
[01:24:40.433 --> 01:24:43.075]  Because the French wanted to take out Gaddafi.
[01:24:43.115 --> 01:24:46.058]  They wanted to put themselves into power there.
[01:24:46.418 --> 01:24:49.661]  Gaddafi was actually a stabilizing factor in the region.
[01:24:50.201 --> 01:24:57.167]  And his biggest crime was that he had a lot of gold and he wasn't going to follow the American Goldman Sachs-George Soto's party line.
[01:24:58.988 --> 01:25:09.571]  So we literally created a swath of destruction from Afghanistan through Libya, Iraq, Syria, all the way down to Yemen, Somalia, and Niger.
[01:25:10.951 --> 01:25:15.952]  What we have done in the last 15 to 20 years is go from 25 failed states to 175 failed states.
[01:25:19.113 --> 01:25:19.614]  The U.S.
[01:25:19.674 --> 01:25:26.082]  government, in our name and at our expense, has destroyed the world and it has destroyed the American domestic economy.
[01:25:26.383 --> 01:25:28.786]  And nobody is holding anyone... That was my next point.
[01:25:28.926 --> 01:25:31.549]  And I mean, clearly, you are a high-level CIA on the ground.
[01:25:31.569 --> 01:25:34.633]  You know about divide-and-conquer strategies, force multiplication.
[01:25:35.214 --> 01:25:40.636]  You can just see the State Department sociology with political correctness dividing everyone.
[01:25:40.656 --> 01:25:44.717]  I mean, it's like Ku Klux Klan propaganda, but through the minorities.
[01:25:45.077 --> 01:25:51.059]  It's so evil, it even shocks me, that they are race-baiting and creating division like this.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:57.001]  Federalizing police, weaponizing them, then the cops do bad stuff, then the answer is bring in more tyranny.
[01:25:57.962 --> 01:25:59.322]  What's your view on all that?
[01:25:59.402 --> 01:26:00.843]  What's really happening in the economy?
[01:26:00.883 --> 01:26:01.503]  Where we're going?
[01:26:02.216 --> 01:26:09.600]  Well, it's funny because I just watched Cynthia McKinney speaking on a Russian TV channel, and she was talking about change management and chaos management.
[01:26:10.021 --> 01:26:11.382]  And you're exactly right, Alex.
[01:26:11.462 --> 01:26:18.166]  Basically, we're destabilizing the world, we're creating massive amounts of fear, and we're spending all of our money
[01:26:19.295 --> 01:26:21.557]  On surveillance and control.
[01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:38.648]  And I have a slide from Medard Gabel on how much we spend on war and how if we spent a third of that on peace, we could give every single person on the planet a two-story cinder block home with running water, electricity, and even a swimming pool.
[01:26:39.989 --> 01:26:48.255]  The injustice that is being perpetuated right now, we now know that 62 people on the planet have as much wealth as the lower three billion.
[01:26:49.315 --> 01:26:50.236]  This is insane!
[01:26:50.716 --> 01:26:56.659]  Concentration of wealth and I have my, you've showed it on your show before, my preconditions of revolution chart.
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:02.263]  The preconditions of revolution all exist in the United States of America today.
[01:27:02.823 --> 01:27:10.587]  We are like a house that has been soaked in gasoline with ammunition put in every room and we're just waiting for the first match to blow by.
[01:27:10.907 --> 01:27:13.349]  And George Soros is running around with sparklers in the street.
[01:27:16.434 --> 01:27:36.528]  And expanding on this, sir, then I come out and say we don't need class warfare, we don't need class envy, but it's the very Davos elites that have transferred the wealth through inside jobs, through crony capitalism, that are lobbying to now take what's left of middle class money and redistribute it, which will end the ladder up for poor people and terminate it using
[01:27:38.214 --> 01:27:43.062]  Social injustice causes to actually sabotage people coming together.
[01:27:43.442 --> 01:27:47.348]  How do you communicate that to the masses of people that are at the breaking point?
[01:27:47.628 --> 01:27:52.876]  How do we keep the establishment from organizing a false revolution that only cements their control?
[01:27:53.647 --> 01:27:57.111]  Alex, I am a huge fan of Ted Cruz and state rights.
[01:27:57.792 --> 01:28:00.976]  I think that it's time for the states to look after their own.
[01:28:01.456 --> 01:28:04.940]  It's time for us to start nullifying federal regulations.
[01:28:05.021 --> 01:28:08.725]  It's time for us to say that the federal government has no right to own land.
[01:28:09.185 --> 01:28:10.988]  There's an absolutely marvelous graphic.
[01:28:11.708 --> 01:28:14.209]  On how much land the federal government owns.
[01:28:14.229 --> 01:28:17.371]  They basically own everything west of the Mississippi and that's a crime.
[01:28:17.411 --> 01:28:18.131]  So what do we do?
[01:28:18.231 --> 01:28:22.873]  I mean we get a coalition of governors and legislatures in an emergency just like 1775, 1776.
[01:28:23.934 --> 01:28:25.234]  We get together.
[01:28:25.474 --> 01:28:26.455]  We announce the crimes.
[01:28:26.695 --> 01:28:28.636]  We point out the feds have been hijacked.
[01:28:28.896 --> 01:28:30.256]  We deploy a plan to the states.
[01:28:30.557 --> 01:28:31.477]  They vote.
[01:28:31.517 --> 01:28:33.298]  We pull out the federal government.
[01:28:33.858 --> 01:28:35.699]  Dissolve it and then how do we reconstitute it?
[01:28:35.979 --> 01:28:42.282]  Because you've got all these operatives in there, there'll be a huge battle over the next level of control that causes a revolution in and of itself.
[01:28:42.562 --> 01:28:49.205]  Look, one of the beautiful things about being a state is that you have the National Guard which works for the governor, not for the president.
[01:28:49.225 --> 01:28:50.306]  You already have the infrastructure.
[01:28:50.905 --> 01:28:53.047]  Yes, you can take over your land.
[01:28:53.167 --> 01:28:56.009]  I personally don't believe we should have absentee landlords.
[01:28:56.589 --> 01:29:00.092]  I think every state should control its own land, its own property.
[01:29:00.132 --> 01:29:01.713]  By the way, I agree with what you're saying.
[01:29:01.793 --> 01:29:04.315]  I'm just putting in the pitfalls of how we need to organize this.
[01:29:04.375 --> 01:29:05.556]  It needs to happen through the states.
[01:29:06.036 --> 01:29:11.820]  I'm huge on truth and reconciliation, and let me point out to you and your listeners that there are some billionaires that get it.
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:15.402]  Lady Lynn Rothschild, who's a babe from New Jersey, by the way.
[01:29:15.442 --> 01:29:16.403]  She just married well.
[01:29:17.204 --> 01:29:23.488]  Lady Lynn Rothschild sponsored a conference on inclusive capitalism in May of 2014.
[01:29:24.068 --> 01:29:28.971]  And we've got some black sheep billionaires out in Silicon Valley who are talking about redemptive capitalism.
[01:29:29.031 --> 01:29:29.532]  I know that.
[01:29:30.372 --> 01:29:31.493]  I've talked to some of them, yes.
[01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:32.454]  Yeah, okay.
[01:29:32.674 --> 01:29:33.875]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:29:34.075 --> 01:29:35.716]  There are a lot of new money people.
[01:29:36.396 --> 01:29:41.921]  Is what you're getting at, and who don't want to suicide everybody and have this apocalyptic craziness, but the elite are digging in.
[01:29:42.101 --> 01:29:42.621]  They're planning it.
[01:29:43.082 --> 01:29:43.762]  Mr. Steele, sorry?
[01:29:44.483 --> 01:29:45.724]  We can fix this, Alex.
[01:29:45.764 --> 01:29:47.085]  You, me, and the governor of Texas.
[01:29:47.505 --> 01:29:49.086]  RobertDavidSteele.com.
[01:29:49.106 --> 01:29:52.849]  Well, the governor listens a lot, so you can tell him what you think straight ahead.
[01:29:52.869 --> 01:29:53.309]  We'll be back.
[01:29:58.854 --> 01:29:59.734]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.235 --> 01:30:01.836]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.757 --> 01:30:05.459]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:11.733 --> 01:30:19.537]  Serving as a microcosm of the Obama administration, a real estate developer partially demolished the reputed birthplace of the Bill of Rights.
[01:30:19.817 --> 01:30:29.883]  The developer, Triple Crown Corp., secured a permit to demolish a two-story stone building, formerly known as James Bell Tavern, in Silver Springs Township, Pennsylvania.
[01:30:30.123 --> 01:30:39.046]  By the time a third of the building was destroyed, the city stopped the demolition because officials realized the Bill of Rights was conceived at the tavern during a 1788 meeting.
[01:30:39.086 --> 01:30:39.346]  Commenter W.C.
[01:30:39.366 --> 01:30:41.047]  Handy wrote to the local Sentinel newspaper.
[01:30:49.130 --> 01:30:52.512]  We have a Congress that is so intent on destroying the Bill of Rights.
[01:30:52.772 --> 01:30:57.674]  The building as it stands now is rather indicative of the current state of our Bill of Rights.
[01:30:57.955 --> 01:31:02.297]  Why not leave the building as it is to serve as a reminder to us all, he added.
[01:31:02.577 --> 01:31:05.719]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[01:31:09.676 --> 01:31:12.898]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:36.241]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:36.302 --> 01:32:41.905]  We put out the daily radio show free with a video and audio feeds at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:32:42.145 --> 01:32:46.187]  But it is the members that are paying it forward and helping.
[01:32:46.607 --> 01:32:56.294]  So many other people see the truth, and it's PrisonPlanet.TV that finances so much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew, the reporters.

[01:33:44.579 --> 01:33:46.840]  We're going back to our guest, Robert David Steele, here in a moment.
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.321]  I want to take a few calls for him.
[01:33:48.621 --> 01:33:49.662]  I'm going to be good and go to him.
[01:33:50.122 --> 01:33:51.843]  I'm bad about getting a guest on and not going to the calls.

[01:33:55.145 --> 01:33:56.906]  Briefly, I want to get right back to our guest.
[01:33:56.946 --> 01:33:57.926]  We're listener supported.
[01:34:06.573 --> 01:34:07.294]  Viewer supported.
[01:34:07.714 --> 01:34:10.356]  We don't get big, you know, globalist advertisers.
[01:34:12.238 --> 01:34:17.442]  We don't get banker bailout money like MSNBC or NPR.
[01:34:19.364 --> 01:34:21.486]  We are supported by the products we sell.
[01:34:21.786 --> 01:34:25.209]  So, A, we try to sell really good products at very competitive prices.
[01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:27.551]  We try to have a wide selection.
[01:34:27.871 --> 01:34:33.356]  When you shop with the good guys, you're funding an organization that's promoting true Americana.
[01:34:34.036 --> 01:34:34.617]  And you know what?
[01:34:35.762 --> 01:34:36.984]  We built it, people have come.
[01:34:37.044 --> 01:34:40.970]  We reach 28 million people a week now, worldwide.
[01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:42.792]  About half of our audience is outside the U.S.
[01:34:42.912 --> 01:34:43.373]  I love that.
[01:34:44.435 --> 01:34:47.780]  But it's the audience inside the United States that mainly finances what we do.
[01:34:49.366 --> 01:34:55.488]  And if you've not become a Nightly News subscriber for $5.95 a month at PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com, you really should.
[01:34:55.748 --> 01:34:57.088]  Check out the benefits and do that.
[01:34:58.408 --> 01:35:05.410]  We're always telling you, you should look online for water testing in your county or your city and find out what's being added, what's being done.
[01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:07.671]  Because the federal laws, the state laws, it's there.
[01:35:08.439 --> 01:35:13.763]  And, man, they take perfect aquifer water in many areas of the country and just put hundreds of horrible things in it.
[01:35:14.183 --> 01:35:17.245]  What you see happening up in Flint, they should all be filtering their water.
[01:35:17.686 --> 01:35:22.109]  There should be a nationwide move, you know, to have the government, you know, airlift that in.
[01:35:22.129 --> 01:35:25.411]  But you see, there's so many scams to water, I'm not going to go off into it.
[01:35:25.431 --> 01:35:26.552]  I went into it in the last hour.
[01:35:27.813 --> 01:35:29.694]  You need to be filtering your shower water.
[01:35:29.714 --> 01:35:31.736]  You need to be filtering your tap water.
[01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:36.809]  Reverse osmosis is great, but you've got to take mineral supplements because it takes out all the minerals.
[01:35:38.751 --> 01:35:45.416]  If you take some of the other type of water, like distilled, it'll kill you, you know, in six months or so.
[01:35:45.436 --> 01:35:49.999]  I mean, I know people that have been drinking that for just two weeks and, you know, gotten really sick because there's nothing in that.
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:36:00.527]  So, again, it's very important that you use the Alexa Pure Pro or you use the Pro Pure type systems that we sell that have been tested, that are high quality.
[01:36:01.616 --> 01:36:01.936]  That's right.
[01:36:17.819 --> 01:36:27.444]  And reduces or cuts out 200 contaminants plus from your shower water where you inhale them, where you go through your skin.
[01:36:27.945 --> 01:36:30.806]  It's the other part of the equation for your family.
[01:36:30.826 --> 01:36:37.210]  I mean, folks, if you want to be healthy, eat clean non-GMO food, all the rest, but water is just as important as clean air.
[01:36:37.230 --> 01:36:41.732]  I mean, if you don't have it, I mean, it's such an important factor.
[01:36:41.992 --> 01:36:42.993]  So get a high quality
[01:36:44.824 --> 01:36:47.806]  ProPureSystem at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:36:47.826 --> 01:36:49.608]  You can see the five-star reviews on the other products.
[01:36:49.628 --> 01:36:50.228]  This is so new.
[01:36:50.248 --> 01:36:51.089]  There's no reviews there.
[01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:52.850]  So as soon as folks get these in, review them.
[01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:56.513]  I've been using mine in the test we did here at the office for months.
[01:36:56.633 --> 01:36:58.915]  I just put mine in last week at my house.
[01:36:58.935 --> 01:36:59.855]  I was like, I've had these for a week.
[01:36:59.895 --> 01:37:00.636]  I haven't put them in yet.
[01:37:01.056 --> 01:37:03.318]  So it's important to take action.
[01:37:03.418 --> 01:37:05.500]  InfowarsStore.com.
[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:06.580]  And then finally,
[01:37:07.561 --> 01:37:09.082]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:37:09.462 --> 01:37:12.043]  We have a new special running today.

[01:37:29.328 --> 01:37:29.689]  All right.
[01:37:30.409 --> 01:37:34.713]  Our guest, ladies and gentlemen, joins us, RobertDavidSteel.com.
[01:37:34.733 --> 01:37:36.715]  He has some other great websites as well.
[01:37:37.496 --> 01:37:42.080]  There is a new book out that he contributed to, Another French False Flag.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.561]  Bloody tracks from Paris to San Bernardino.
[01:37:44.581 --> 01:37:53.827]  I want to get into that some too, but you were getting into the fact that not everybody's a suicidal nihilist or eugenicist in the global combine.
[01:37:54.647 --> 01:38:05.414]  But I want to ask you, what is the main driving force in the main combines that get together at Bilderberg and Davos and kind of iron out their differences like a mafia summit every year?
[01:38:05.434 --> 01:38:10.257]  And then what are some of these factions you're saying that don't want to bring us into the new dark age?
[01:38:11.175 --> 01:38:14.998]  Well, Alex, basically I think, you know, Animal Farm was a great book.
[01:38:15.579 --> 01:38:24.907]  I think the ultra-elite, which certainly leans toward neo-Nazi and even satanic influences, they think of us as expendable farm animals.
[01:38:25.047 --> 01:38:25.888]  We're nothing to them.
[01:38:26.933 --> 01:38:31.015]  Um, and they basically see profit from war as good.
[01:38:31.616 --> 01:38:35.498]  And they even like disease because the CDC is a massive scam.
[01:38:36.038 --> 01:38:45.824]  Most of these vaccines and most of these pharmaceuticals that we're pushing off and most of the stuff that we sell on supermarket shelves, it's just plain poison, but it's profitable poison.
[01:38:46.324 --> 01:38:48.085]  So we're treated as a money machine.
[01:38:48.545 --> 01:38:49.566]  Now, the good news is
[01:38:50.882 --> 01:39:14.120]  That a few of the billionaires, Lady Lynn Rothschild, the Black Sheep billionaires, the Mars family in Virginia, a couple of others, maybe Michael Bloomberg in New York City, they're starting to understand that the blue-collar master class, the white-collar cubicle class, and the academic gold-collar class are the golden goose.
[01:39:14.961 --> 01:39:16.902]  That's the heart of productivity.
[01:39:17.522 --> 01:39:22.783]  And they're starting to realize that they're getting very close to having people burning down their mansions.
[01:39:23.023 --> 01:39:30.146]  And we have a lot of angry veterans that know how to put a .50 caliber bullet into a Learjet that's taking off and landing.
[01:39:31.326 --> 01:39:35.927]  So we're very, very close to an extraordinarily unstable situation.
[01:39:36.467 --> 01:39:39.968]  So I personally, I sent a certified letter to the governor of Texas.
[01:39:40.048 --> 01:39:41.269]  I hope he actually gets it.
[01:39:42.249 --> 01:39:51.055]  Urging him to convene an electoral reform summit and to call for a virtual constitutional convention.
[01:39:51.135 --> 01:39:59.960]  One of the guys I admire besides yourself is Mike Levin and his radio show and his books on liberty and the constitutional convention and so forth.
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:06.024]  I think Texas should sponsor a virtual constitutional convention no later than March.
[01:40:06.784 --> 01:40:14.047]  We need to get all these issues out, and we need to understand just how vulnerable the United States is to complete meltdown.
[01:40:16.308 --> 01:40:17.068]  Please continue.
[01:40:18.909 --> 01:40:25.271]  Well, you know, I mean, I've actually produced a list of seven things, and I personally
[01:40:26.451 --> 01:40:34.054]  I'm a little concerned about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, and if it comes down to Trump or Clinton, I think Michael Bloomberg is going to have to run for president.
[01:40:34.554 --> 01:40:49.839]  Well, I get that Bloomberg takes the Henry Ford position that you've got to have employees paid enough to buy your cars, and so he isn't pushing it into 21, but he's so anti-gun... Yes, he's going to have to compromise on that.
[01:40:50.039 --> 01:40:52.000]  You know, and politics is about compromise.
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:59.103]  I think one of the problems with people that are against guns is that they're living in an ivory tower.
[01:40:59.143 --> 01:41:03.865]  Why do so many smart people like you that I agree with like 95% of and people like
[01:41:05.319 --> 01:41:07.140]  Perry Dent, like Bloomberg?
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:08.901]  Because, I mean, I just can't stand him.
[01:41:08.941 --> 01:41:09.501]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:41:09.541 --> 01:41:09.961]  Go ahead.
[01:41:10.181 --> 01:41:14.323]  Yeah, no, that's okay, Alex, because I would insist that you be his vice president.
[01:41:14.383 --> 01:41:18.064]  You could be a balancing factor here.
[01:41:19.165 --> 01:41:21.226]  Look, I'm agnostic on who's president.
[01:41:21.466 --> 01:41:22.386]  I really don't care.
[01:41:22.686 --> 01:41:28.029]  I just want my country back, I want my Constitution restored, and I want integrity back in the electoral system.
[01:41:28.389 --> 01:41:29.409]  We don't have that right now.
[01:41:29.449 --> 01:41:32.831]  We have a two-party tyranny that is screwing 60% of the public.
[01:41:34.371 --> 01:41:45.816]  Um, and I really believe that we need to find some combination, a bipartisan ticket, a Republican and a Democrat, a coalition cabinet.
[01:41:45.856 --> 01:41:47.597]  You know about fantasy football.
[01:41:47.937 --> 01:41:49.877]  I actually want to have a fantasy cabinet.
[01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:50.638]  No, I understand.
[01:41:50.658 --> 01:41:55.700]  I mean, look, a con-con's the way to go, and I was never one for one, but the Constitution's already so gone.
[01:41:56.380 --> 01:42:02.785]  Why not an emergency point when the states are already on our side to actually go in there and get the federal government back in line?
[01:42:03.165 --> 01:42:06.388]  That's the type of platform bully pulpit that would allow all this.
[01:42:06.408 --> 01:42:10.531]  But getting past the fantasy football, obviously, I mean, Hillary's terrible.
[01:42:10.871 --> 01:42:12.332]  What is your issues with Donald Trump?
[01:42:12.352 --> 01:42:13.033]  I'd love to hear those.
[01:42:13.933 --> 01:42:19.477]  Well, I actually published an article in Counterpunch, Countercoop, How Donald Trump Can Win.
[01:42:20.078 --> 01:42:25.362]  And I outlined these seven ideas and I was completely blown off by Donald Trump and his staff.
[01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:30.005]  The big problem with Trump, in my view, is that he's me, me, me.
[01:42:30.686 --> 01:42:32.869]  Donald Trump is all about Donald Trump.
[01:42:32.909 --> 01:42:35.653]  He does not give a shit about the rest of us.
[01:42:39.127 --> 01:42:41.087]  Mr. Steele, we're on a lot of MNFM stations.
[01:42:41.107 --> 01:42:43.748]  We're able to catch that, but please.
[01:42:43.948 --> 01:42:44.748]  I apologize.
[01:42:44.828 --> 01:42:45.528]  I apologize.
[01:42:45.548 --> 01:42:45.948]  No, no, no.
[01:42:46.008 --> 01:42:48.729]  I know you're used to Europe and stuff where people can say whatever they want.
[01:42:48.749 --> 01:42:51.770]  He does not care about the rest of us.
[01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:57.931]  One of the big mistakes that he's making is he thinks he can get away with just himself and what he knows.
[01:42:58.491 --> 01:43:00.131]  Jim Webb has the same problem.
[01:43:00.171 --> 01:43:03.592]  When Jim Webb says that he's his own national security advisor.
[01:43:03.852 --> 01:43:04.112]  There.
[01:43:04.752 --> 01:43:07.933]  That is a sign of my effort to help Trump.
[01:43:08.669 --> 01:43:19.442]  What do you make of the former Defense Secretary Gates coming out, I don't even know if that's true, and saying Obama calls everybody in and says, I'm smarter than you, I can do all your jobs better?
[01:43:20.183 --> 01:43:20.824]  Well, I agree.
[01:43:21.184 --> 01:43:27.391]  Look, see, part of the problem is ever since the assassination of John F. Kennedy, every president has been a puppet.
[01:43:28.713 --> 01:43:32.115]  From Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan, they've all been puppets.
[01:43:32.796 --> 01:43:35.738]  And they're all also on these massive ego trips.
[01:43:36.559 --> 01:43:42.663]  Chris Hedges has written a great book called Empire of Illusion, The Loss of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle.
[01:43:43.584 --> 01:43:46.887]  All of these presidents think that they're some kind of decider.
[01:43:47.247 --> 01:43:47.767]  They're not.
[01:43:47.928 --> 01:43:52.191]  The decisions are being made by Rockefeller and others in Wall Street and the City of London.
[01:43:52.671 --> 01:43:55.674]  And these guys are just extremely highly paid actors.
[01:43:56.394 --> 01:44:07.130]  Now, I think Trump has the power to win if he were, for example, to take Cynthia McKinney as his vice president, a great woman of color from Georgia.
[01:44:08.297 --> 01:44:24.770]  And if he were to name a coalition cabinet and field a balanced budget and push electoral reform, I mean, one of the problems with every single senator running for president is that not a single one of them has been willing to introduce an electoral reform act in Congress.
[01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:26.732]  You know, it's funny you say that because
[01:44:27.924 --> 01:44:40.713]  Up until like the 30s and stuff, that's what used to happen is if somebody wanted to win, say they were a Democrat or Republican, they would end up taking one of the leaders from the other party in a coalition government and make them the Vice President.
[01:44:41.013 --> 01:44:42.074]  Why doesn't that happen anymore?
[01:44:42.094 --> 01:44:43.655]  That's constitutionally mandated.
[01:44:44.255 --> 01:44:46.296]  The runner-up became vice president.
[01:44:46.356 --> 01:44:46.616]  Sure.
[01:44:46.716 --> 01:44:49.257]  And we had the senators representing the states.
[01:44:49.517 --> 01:44:49.877]  Exactly.
[01:44:49.917 --> 01:44:51.637]  So they got rid of that around the same time too.
[01:44:51.677 --> 01:44:53.278]  For people that don't know, that's important.
[01:44:53.598 --> 01:44:58.299]  The state legislatures used to elect the senators, showing that state checkmate, that check.
[01:44:58.539 --> 01:44:58.739]  Yeah.
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:01.680]  That's why I want a constitutional convention.
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:06.362]  And I'm telling you, Alex, if the governor of Texas will connect with Mike Levin,
[01:45:07.442 --> 01:45:12.806]  And Sheldon Adelson, who I actually think is going to be a huge force in this election.
[01:45:13.486 --> 01:45:18.169]  One of the things that has to be settled before we have an election is Israel.
[01:45:18.849 --> 01:45:22.372]  Israel is the third rail in American politics.
[01:45:23.052 --> 01:45:30.619]  And I believe we have to have a constitutional convention, we have to have a truth and reconciliation meeting on Israel and Palestine.
[01:45:31.019 --> 01:45:40.288]  We have to make some decisions on how we're going to be not funding the Saudi Arabian sponsorship of terrorism and subsidizing... Oh yeah, let me ask you that question.
[01:45:40.328 --> 01:45:42.850]  Looking at this fog, is the U.S.
[01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:49.216]  really allied with the Saudis or the Iranians, or are they playing it off as a Sunni-Shiite civil war?
[01:45:50.663 --> 01:46:00.160]  Right now I think the United States government is actively sponsoring ISIS as a destabilizing force.
[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:01.442]  So they're really not into the old Iran?
[01:46:02.898 --> 01:46:05.499]  Well, you know, Iran is the adult in the neighborhood.
[01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:12.962]  I'm sorry, but I went to college with Iranian engineers, and those are some of the smartest guys on the planet.
[01:46:13.443 --> 01:46:20.145]  These are stable, sensible people, and those who are trying to... I agree, and like 80% of them hate their government.
[01:46:20.345 --> 01:46:27.288]  How are these super smart people, as smart as they come, they invented chess, run by a bunch of, you know, guys who have them living in caves?
[01:46:27.348 --> 01:46:30.650]  Alex, ask yourself why we're run by a bunch of morons in Washington.
[01:46:31.587 --> 01:46:31.967]  Okay?
[01:46:32.487 --> 01:46:36.009]  We're all abdicating our responsibility as citizens.
[01:46:36.729 --> 01:46:39.030]  We are all sitting by the wayside.
[01:46:39.090 --> 01:46:43.292]  I just had an exchange on LinkedIn with this guy that thinks Bernie Sanders is the cat's meow.
[01:46:43.352 --> 01:46:44.933]  I think Bernie Sanders is a fraud.
[01:46:45.794 --> 01:46:59.760]  Sanders is totally committed to the two-party tyranny, and nobody, including Rachel Maddow, wants to discuss the fact that the two-party tyranny has disenfranchised 60% of Americans, including all Latinos, all blacks, all women, and all youth.
[01:47:02.208 --> 01:47:05.951]  All I know is Bernie Sanders doesn't talk about crony capitalism.
[01:47:06.011 --> 01:47:07.692]  He says capitalism's the problem.
[01:47:07.972 --> 01:47:09.713]  Our problem is crony capitalism.
[01:47:11.114 --> 01:47:17.219]  Look, Bernie Sanders, actually, whether Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders or Ted Cruz, I would vote for anybody.
[01:47:17.824 --> 01:47:21.005]  that agreed to restore integrity to our electoral process.
[01:47:21.065 --> 01:47:31.046]  Now that's the other problem with Bernie Sanders is he wants to create a bigger government with more welfare and more government regulation and more government mandates.
[01:47:31.446 --> 01:47:33.227]  So he's really a light version.
[01:47:33.287 --> 01:47:45.529]  I've got a wonderful cartoon which you've probably got around someplace of this big bird with its claws on Capitol Hill and one wing of the bird is red and one wing of the bird is blue and and the caption is one one
[01:47:49.073 --> 01:47:53.654]  One bird, two wings, same... And I'll spell it, Alex, I don't know if you want to do it.
[01:47:53.674 --> 01:47:54.115]  No, don't do it.
[01:47:54.135 --> 01:47:55.755]  Same poop, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:55.815 --> 01:47:57.136]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:57.336 --> 01:47:58.796]  Let's go to some phone calls real quick.
[01:47:59.556 --> 01:48:02.017]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in New York.
[01:48:02.057 --> 01:48:07.259]  Go ahead, you're on the air with former CIA field commander Robert David Steele, robertdavidsteele.com.
[01:48:08.719 --> 01:48:09.779]  Hiya, guys.
[01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:14.481]  I have in my hand here a piece of paper, a news release
[01:48:15.376 --> 01:48:29.866]  And I'm wondering if this times in with a false flag in San Bernardino, and I'm wondering also if this is fuel for impeachment to get Mr. Obama out of office as promptly as possible.
[01:48:30.526 --> 01:48:36.750]  The article says here nuclear plants shut down if the 10 control rods accidentally fall into reactor core.
[01:48:37.671 --> 01:48:38.652]  That's enough to
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:41.200]  Where is this?
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:42.161]  Where is this?
[01:48:42.181 --> 01:48:43.701]  When did this happen?
[01:48:43.761 --> 01:48:45.702]  You know, that's the thing.
[01:48:45.742 --> 01:48:49.063]  They admit all these rackers are rotting, basically.
[01:48:49.103 --> 01:48:52.145]  There's all these disasters happening, and used to be national news.
[01:48:52.165 --> 01:48:56.366]  Do the elite think radiation laws of nature have changed, Mr. Steele?
[01:49:09.938 --> 01:49:14.583]  No, and part of the, my favorite word in the English language is integrity.
[01:49:15.344 --> 01:49:19.468]  Now, Chernobyl and Fukushima have taken us into new places.
[01:49:19.968 --> 01:49:23.832]  Fukushima is poisoning the entire Pacific Ocean, the entire West Coast.
[01:49:24.393 --> 01:49:30.279]  The federal government is now undermining all of its radiation control standards.
[01:49:30.299 --> 01:49:33.122]  But Ann Coulter said the Japanese should thank them because it's good for you.
[01:49:36.902 --> 01:49:37.362]  Go there.
[01:49:37.762 --> 01:49:41.746]  Look, Alex, the bottom line here is that the entire U.S.
[01:49:42.006 --> 01:49:44.508]  culture has become a cheating culture.
[01:49:44.948 --> 01:49:46.710]  That's actually a title of a book.
[01:49:46.810 --> 01:49:47.650]  That's it, it is.
[01:49:48.051 --> 01:49:52.454]  We no longer stand for anything, whether it's New York values or Texas values.
[01:49:52.474 --> 01:49:55.537]  And we lie to ourselves and think radiation won't hurt our kids.
[01:49:56.037 --> 01:49:56.878]  Exactly right.
[01:49:57.018 --> 01:49:57.839]  Or vaccines.
[01:49:58.059 --> 01:49:59.900]  Or poisons on the supermarket.
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:01.521]  So here's the bottom line.
[01:50:02.282 --> 01:50:16.629]  We have got to convene a national conversation in which we focus on restoring the Constitution, which includes the runner-up as vice president and the senators as representatives of the states.
[01:50:17.369 --> 01:50:22.731]  We have to demand that the federal stop owning land and stop taxing citizens.
[01:50:22.751 --> 01:50:27.774]  I actually think it's unconstitutional for the federal government to tax individual citizens.
[01:50:28.374 --> 01:50:31.116]  We are the United States of America.
[01:50:31.136 --> 01:50:31.756]  Well, it is.
[01:50:31.796 --> 01:50:32.757]  It is until 1913.
[01:50:32.797 --> 01:50:33.818]  You're absolutely on target.
[01:50:33.838 --> 01:50:39.261]  And people have grown up in slavery so long, they don't even know that what we're saying is what made America so great.
[01:50:39.581 --> 01:50:41.282]  Well, I can't say this enough times.
[01:50:41.322 --> 01:50:49.608]  The governor of Texas and Mike Levin and you and a few others have the power with with Sheldon Adelson to bring us all together in a virtual
[01:50:50.288 --> 01:50:51.689]  Constitutional Convention.
[01:50:51.729 --> 01:50:57.594]  Not an actual Constitutional Convention, but a virtual Constitutional Convention in March in Texas.
[01:50:58.055 --> 01:50:59.215]  Let's get all this on the table.
[01:51:00.196 --> 01:51:06.141]  And again, even if it was just ceremonial, it would have so much attention to it as a debate.
[01:51:06.381 --> 01:51:09.884]  You can't lose, because then it isn't even binding, but you started the first wave.
[01:51:09.904 --> 01:51:11.065]  Are you prepared to bug out?
[01:51:11.325 --> 01:51:19.072]  Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger have produced a high-speed DVD and book to show you how to drive in combat, patrol, and how to survive in combat.
[01:51:19.292 --> 01:51:19.553]  I lost it.

[01:53:38.621 --> 01:53:41.363]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:53:41.683 --> 01:53:44.285]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[01:53:44.325 --> 01:53:44.746]  Croix River.
[01:53:45.046 --> 01:53:45.707]  I loved my dad.
[01:53:46.107 --> 01:53:47.068]  But boy was he stubborn.
[01:53:47.288 --> 01:53:50.010]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:53:50.250 --> 01:53:50.770]  His excuse?
[01:53:51.131 --> 01:53:52.192]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:53:52.472 --> 01:53:53.753]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:53:54.073 --> 01:53:59.577]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:53:59.837 --> 01:54:00.578]  Don't wait.
[01:54:00.878 --> 01:54:03.240]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now.

[01:54:10.322 --> 01:54:12.551]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:54:12.571 --> 01:54:15.905]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:20.006 --> 01:54:22.247]  The third hour is coming up.
[01:54:22.287 --> 01:54:26.488]  Then, of course, we have the fourth hour hosted by Anthony Gucciardi today, InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:54:26.948 --> 01:54:29.209]  Seven o'clock Central Standard Time this evening.
[01:54:29.809 --> 01:54:32.149]  And, of course, we have the weekend four to six p.m.
[01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:36.391]  Central radio show that I host, and I will be hosting that this weekend.
[01:54:37.231 --> 01:54:40.332]  David Knight and Leanne McAdoo will be in Flint, Michigan tomorrow.
[01:54:41.292 --> 01:54:52.221]  Uh, covering where they're trying to cause divide and conquer, race stuff over the horrible poison water the government was feeding people, uh, was giving them to have, and then telling them it was fine.
[01:54:52.541 --> 01:54:53.582]  That's what they do across the board.
[01:54:54.923 --> 01:54:56.444]  But they want to turn it into a race issue.
[01:54:56.464 --> 01:54:58.625]  Uh, fine, if that gets attention to it.
[01:54:58.686 --> 01:55:00.247]  You know, I finally agree with Michael Moore.
[01:55:00.307 --> 01:55:01.107]  It is genocide.
[01:55:02.288 --> 01:55:05.511]  But what about the 40% of people that are there that are white or Hispanic?
[01:55:07.759 --> 01:55:10.240]  Oh, 60% are black, it's genocide.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:12.101]  So then I don't agree with Moore.
[01:55:13.002 --> 01:55:15.983]  Is it genocide if it was 60% white in the town?
[01:55:16.363 --> 01:55:18.484]  It's an attack on us.
[01:55:18.744 --> 01:55:21.606]  And folks, there is social engineering going on through the water.
[01:55:21.806 --> 01:55:23.667]  They make jokes about it, Dr. Strangelove.
[01:55:25.017 --> 01:55:27.258]  It's really going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:27.939 --> 01:55:29.139]  It's really happening.
[01:55:29.539 --> 01:55:31.120]  They admit fluoride's doing all this.
[01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:36.323]  And coming up, Dr. Gribbs is going to be in the studio to talk about that, how it affects fertility, and more.
[01:55:36.703 --> 01:55:40.305]  He's going to be with us for a little bit of this segment and the next segment, and then Mr. Steele's going to leave us.
[01:55:40.645 --> 01:55:43.507]  I want to get him up every few months just to talk about news.
[01:55:43.527 --> 01:55:50.230]  In fact, I want to get him up next week if he can do it, just to get into false flags itself, some of his CIA stories that he can get into with us.
[01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:51.111]  I want to go to a few more
[01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:56.661]  Calls right now, but I cannot stress enough to you that we've reached an event horizon point.
[01:55:57.102 --> 01:56:00.888]  Not just for this show, but for Liberty Base Media period.
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:08.346]  If you continue to tell friends and family and neighbors and on your Facebook posts and Twitter about Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:56:08.806 --> 01:56:11.128]  If you continue to say hey you want the answers it's here.
[01:56:11.548 --> 01:56:13.130]  People are ready to hear it now.
[01:56:13.450 --> 01:56:17.734]  We have tripled online audiences with audio and video feeds the last three months.
[01:56:18.074 --> 01:56:21.197]  Normally it maybe doubles in a year if we're lucky.
[01:56:21.437 --> 01:56:22.538]  We've been growing exponential.
[01:56:23.078 --> 01:56:23.619]  Tripling.
[01:56:24.537 --> 01:56:27.038]  The last three, three and a half months, at a scary level.
[01:56:27.258 --> 01:56:33.760]  So expenses go up as well with bandwidth, so please, please support us financially by shopping at InfoWareStore.com, but keep spreading the word.
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:48.323]  And Mr. Shield, I want to go to a few calls here in this segment and the next, but the few minutes we have left, the experience I'm having of our audience exploding, and Chris Carter coming out and saying, the new X-Files is based on Alex Jones, we reached out to him, he says he knows his admirer, big listener, we're going to hook up.
[01:56:48.844 --> 01:56:53.405]  The fact that just myself as a ping, as a culture person, it's not me, me, me, but I'm saying,
[01:56:54.065 --> 01:57:00.008]  You know, who Alex Jones is, is getting so big, is an example of how the establishment's losing the info war.
[01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:01.229]  Do you agree with that statement?
[01:57:02.210 --> 01:57:03.591]  I do agree with that statement.
[01:57:03.651 --> 01:57:05.272]  They are losing the info war.
[01:57:05.552 --> 01:57:07.933]  And what's happening, I mean, look at ABC.
[01:57:07.953 --> 01:57:10.314]  What's happening is they're not controlling everybody.
[01:57:10.975 --> 01:57:22.942]  So, the national news media had witnesses on national television talking about three white, paramilitary-dressed men shooting up San Bernardino.
[01:57:24.130 --> 01:57:29.353]  And then the FEMA, whoever it is that's running the narrative, swoops in.
[01:57:29.373 --> 01:57:31.094]  Of course, the FBI is already there.
[01:57:31.594 --> 01:57:33.275]  And they stop that narrative.
[01:57:33.475 --> 01:57:38.038]  And too many American citizens don't notice the disconnect.
[01:57:38.458 --> 01:57:38.878]  OK?
[01:57:39.298 --> 01:57:41.139]  But it's happening more and more often.
[01:57:41.199 --> 01:57:43.861]  And so I think they are losing the narrative.
[01:57:44.021 --> 01:57:53.286]  And I think that if Texas were to sponsor a national conversation, I think we could actually mobilize most of the country into paying attention.
[01:57:54.448 --> 01:57:58.069]  Well, we need to support the governor and his call for a CON-CON for real with the states.
[01:57:58.349 --> 01:58:05.690]  But I agree, host a summit about a CON-CON and discuss what the states would do there to generate... I mean, that's how you do it.
[01:58:05.730 --> 01:58:07.351]  We need a pre-convention.
[01:58:07.911 --> 01:58:08.811]  Do a dry run.
[01:58:09.091 --> 01:58:09.791]  Absolutely.
[01:58:09.891 --> 01:58:12.412]  And that dry run will then define the thing.
[01:58:12.452 --> 01:58:18.453]  Because one of the problems that we have is that these Republican and Democratic debates are low-level idiocy.
[01:58:19.333 --> 01:58:34.226]  Uh, not a single candidate can actually discuss the 10 high-level threats to humanity, or the 12 core policy domains, or why Latinos, women, blacks, and children are being screwed by the existing policies and by their planned policies.
[01:58:34.586 --> 01:58:39.009]  Not a single one of them has actually got a full employment plan for this country.
[01:58:39.410 --> 01:58:46.335]  So I think a pre-conference, a dry run of a constitutional convention... Robert David Steele, stay there.
[01:58:46.355 --> 01:58:48.017]  We're going to come back and take a few phone calls.
[01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:51.833]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:36.197 --> 02:00:46.605]  If you are a PrisonPlanet.TV viewer watching a live feed, or watching an InfoWars.com forward slash show, you can see the InfoWars News Center.
[02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:48.981]  And that is just one wing.
[02:00:49.601 --> 02:01:06.489]  We have three other rooms and a fourth being set up right now, crammed full of patriots, scanning the news, putting information on social media, running shows, getting clips together, producing reports, editing video, talking to investigative journalists, lining up Cy Hirsch.
[02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:11.892]  Lining up Donald Trump, lining up Ted Cruz, lining up Rand Paul.
[02:01:12.232 --> 02:01:18.415]  Just in here building real media and telling you what we think, not hiding our bias to promote liberty and freedom.
[02:01:18.775 --> 02:01:20.036]  Robert David Steele is our guest.
[02:01:20.756 --> 02:01:21.857]  RobertDavidSteele.com.
[02:01:21.877 --> 02:01:24.178]  He also has his other great news sites you can link through there.
[02:01:24.898 --> 02:01:29.200]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul in Arizona, then Jim and others.
[02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:30.240]  Paul, you're on the air.
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:33.082]  Hey Alex, may God bless you.
[02:01:33.662 --> 02:01:35.423]  I have a question for Mr. Steele.
[02:01:36.485 --> 02:01:45.873]  We all know that Libya had a boatload of gold, and do we know where the gold is now, after he's been assassinated?
[02:01:46.754 --> 02:01:49.276]  I don't know, but I'm pretty sure we took it.
[02:01:52.258 --> 02:01:57.723]  That's right, every time there's a war and everything gets looted, no one asks where all the antiquities or the gold or the treasury money went.
[02:01:58.183 --> 02:01:59.745]  It's just default to not ask questions.
[02:02:00.438 --> 02:02:09.925]  No, I mean, we ran out of gold, and there's very strong rumors that Tim Geissner, when he was at the Fed in New York, was actually selling false gold.
[02:02:09.945 --> 02:02:10.405]  Tungsten.
[02:02:10.946 --> 02:02:12.987]  Titanium covered with gold sheeting.
[02:02:14.068 --> 02:02:16.289]  I don't think Fort Knox has any gold in it.
[02:02:17.590 --> 02:02:26.537]  So I do believe that a lot of gold was stolen in 9-11 by prior arrangement, and I do believe that the Libyan gold was a major target of our attack.
[02:02:28.789 --> 02:02:29.209]  Alright.
[02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:30.571]  Sorry, go ahead, Paul.
[02:02:31.491 --> 02:02:32.873]  I said I believe that, too.
[02:02:34.334 --> 02:02:39.098]  Because he wanted to start the... Well, I mean, we now have the State Department emails.
[02:02:39.138 --> 02:02:40.179]  Good to hear from you, Paul.
[02:02:40.479 --> 02:02:42.341]  I mean, we're just proving right again, just over and over again.
[02:02:42.721 --> 02:02:44.983]  That's the thing, it's not that hard if you just study history.
[02:02:45.664 --> 02:02:47.305]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Washington.
[02:02:47.325 --> 02:02:50.107]  You're on the air with our former CIA insider.
[02:02:50.147 --> 02:02:50.428]  Go ahead.
[02:02:51.894 --> 02:02:54.036]  Hey Alex, I really appreciate your show.
[02:02:54.356 --> 02:02:59.240]  Mr. Steele, I have a two-point question regarding constitutional convention.
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:07.487]  First of all, since our cheating culture is not obeying the Constitution now, what makes
[02:03:08.107 --> 02:03:11.410]  Anyone think that a couple of more amendments are going to make any difference?
[02:03:11.490 --> 02:03:18.937]  And secondly, once a Constitutional Convention is started, it becomes an entity unto itself.
[02:03:19.057 --> 02:03:23.881]  And like the first one, and only one that we've had, was out of control.
[02:03:24.001 --> 02:03:28.565]  And since the elite have plans for a Constitutional Convention like this,
[02:03:31.067 --> 02:03:31.608]  Absolutely.
[02:03:31.668 --> 02:03:33.550]  I've always been against it for those reasons.
[02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:36.573]  We're in such dangerous straits now.
[02:03:36.673 --> 02:03:42.119]  All I'm saying is that if it's led by patriots from the beginning, we can control it.
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:44.621]  We can have dry runs as well.
[02:03:45.442 --> 02:03:54.590]  And then we can sit there and, you know, try to actually fix the country and use it as a way to educate the public with leadership against the culture of corruption.
[02:03:54.650 --> 02:03:55.671]  But the caller's right.
[02:03:56.071 --> 02:04:00.955]  If we are a fallen society, maybe we're like Humpty Dumpty and can't be put back together again.
[02:04:00.995 --> 02:04:01.395]  Go ahead.
[02:04:02.096 --> 02:04:03.497]  It comes back to state rights.
[02:04:03.577 --> 02:04:07.521]  I mean, first off, the Constitution has been undermined by some of these amendments.
[02:04:08.421 --> 02:04:12.805]  This whole electoral college thing is a huge mistake in my view.
[02:04:12.865 --> 02:04:14.266]  The 17th Amendment getting rid of the Senators.
[02:04:14.906 --> 02:04:15.527]  Exactly.
[02:04:15.707 --> 02:04:18.009]  And the 12th Amendment, the 14th Amendment, the 16th Amendment.
[02:04:18.029 --> 02:04:19.150]  The 16th to give us the IRS.
[02:04:19.210 --> 02:04:21.772]  It all happened in 1913 with the last CON CON.
[02:04:22.272 --> 02:04:22.512]  Right.
[02:04:22.572 --> 02:04:27.456]  Now let me make the comment that... So how about a CON CON to reverse the last CON CON?
[02:04:28.176 --> 02:04:36.283]  I'd actually like to have a CON CON that is out of control with the public being out of control rather than a CON CON that's out of control with the elites being out of control.
[02:04:37.023 --> 02:04:40.185]  I have more faith in the average American than I do in our elite.
[02:04:40.205 --> 02:04:40.686]  I'll say this.
[02:04:40.726 --> 02:04:42.267]  Desperate times mean desperate means.
[02:04:42.287 --> 02:04:43.548]  They're ignoring it all anyways.
[02:04:43.948 --> 02:04:46.470]  I just say throw it all into hell and let God sort it out.
[02:04:47.050 --> 02:04:49.032]  Let's have a national conversation.
[02:04:49.952 --> 02:04:52.154]  I've never agreed with this and I'm not sure I completely do now.
[02:04:52.234 --> 02:04:55.236]  I'm just saying I really know Greg Abbott's for real.
[02:04:55.536 --> 02:04:56.957]  We're already dying on the table here.
[02:04:56.977 --> 02:04:58.038]  I don't know what else we can do.
[02:04:58.078 --> 02:04:59.739]  But Mr. Steele, great debate.
[02:05:00.039 --> 02:05:01.380]  Jim, great points, Jim.
[02:05:01.761 --> 02:05:02.561]  Thank you so much.
[02:05:03.122 --> 02:05:03.722]  I hear you.
[02:05:03.882 --> 02:05:06.404]  I totally understand your points and I'm looking at both.
[02:05:06.644 --> 02:05:07.824]  Mr. Steele, thank you so much.
[02:05:08.425 --> 02:05:09.265]  My pleasure, Alex.
[02:05:09.345 --> 02:05:09.645]  Bye-bye.
[02:05:09.825 --> 02:05:23.389]  A declassified email sent on April 2, 2011 to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reveals the invasion of Libya was launched to prevent Muammar Gaddafi from establishing a pan-African currency based on Libya's gold.
[02:05:23.769 --> 02:05:25.950]  According to the document posted on the U.S.
[02:05:25.970 --> 02:05:37.555]  State Department website, advisors to the second son of Gaddafi told sources the Libyan government held 143 tons of gold and a similar amount of silver valued at more than $7 billion.
[02:05:38.175 --> 02:05:44.338]  The gold and silver was to be used to establish an alternative currency to the French franc for African countries.
[02:05:44.658 --> 02:05:51.541]  A large number of Western African countries are former French colonies and many continue to hold French as the official language.
[02:05:51.781 --> 02:05:53.262]  During the invasion of Libya,
[02:05:53.502 --> 02:06:00.090]  Analysts argued Gaddafi planned to stop selling oil in US dollars and demanded instead it be traded in gold.
[02:06:00.311 --> 02:06:05.397]  Prior to the invasion, Gaddafi urged other African and Middle Eastern nations to follow suit.
[02:06:05.537 --> 02:06:09.182]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:32.104]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:32.164 --> 02:08:35.066]  Monday through Friday.
[02:08:46.277 --> 02:08:47.258]  From 11 a.m.
[02:08:47.918 --> 02:08:48.579]  to 3 p.m.
[02:08:48.599 --> 02:08:50.841]  Central, we're here live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:08:51.301 --> 02:08:53.403]  Dr. Gribbs can be pulling double duty today.
[02:08:53.423 --> 02:08:56.506]  In fact, let's get both these guys in this studio today if we can.
[02:08:57.607 --> 02:09:00.329]  So you guys going in the Situation Room, you're here in the War Room.
[02:09:00.569 --> 02:09:07.975]  You're gonna be here for this hour and then continuing on with phone calls for listeners, Dr. Gribb, into the fourth hour today.
[02:09:07.995 --> 02:09:09.777]  And then we're gonna really make you work.
[02:09:10.097 --> 02:09:15.502]  We're going to interview you on another subject on health and wellness for the Nightly News this evening.
[02:09:15.522 --> 02:09:20.946]  We're going to be talking about the water situation, what's happening in Flint that they're calling racism.
[02:09:21.207 --> 02:09:22.888]  How about anti-human behavior?
[02:09:24.269 --> 02:09:28.853]  Whoever knew they were giving poison water to people needs to be indicted.
[02:09:29.694 --> 02:09:33.598]  They're saying make the governor resign, fine, but actually get who's responsible and go after them.
[02:09:34.534 --> 02:09:36.414]  Water is being poisoned all over.
[02:09:36.474 --> 02:09:37.615]  So that's the larger issue.
[02:09:37.995 --> 02:09:41.596]  I'm upset about water being toxic across the board.
[02:09:41.636 --> 02:09:43.216]  That's why we say get water filtration.
[02:09:43.656 --> 02:09:46.897]  And the best systems at the best prices are at info or store.com.
[02:09:47.277 --> 02:09:50.138]  And you're funding a hardcore operation promoting liberty.
[02:09:50.158 --> 02:09:51.638]  It takes a lot of money to do that.
[02:09:51.938 --> 02:09:54.599]  So it is a win, win, win, 360 win.
[02:09:55.199 --> 02:10:00.360]  Now, I have had so many people, for whatever reason, themes come up in your life.
[02:10:03.396 --> 02:10:19.364]  And I've seen a theme in the last few months with friends and family and my personal trainer that trains me a few times a week, who's married and wants to have kids soon, and so many others saying, everybody I know, even 25, 30, 35 year olds, not just 40 year old women, can't have kids.
[02:10:22.722 --> 02:10:23.543]  And it's admitted.
[02:10:23.583 --> 02:10:25.545]  We're going to just type into the search engine.
[02:10:25.846 --> 02:10:27.267]  Western fertility drops.
[02:10:27.668 --> 02:10:32.634]  Sperm counts drop by 87 to 95 percent depending on what study, what country.
[02:10:32.674 --> 02:10:34.055]  But it's over 90 percent on average.
[02:10:36.698 --> 02:10:46.382]  GMO is leaching out the modified organisms into your DNA, into your mitochondrial DNA that's in the women as well.
[02:10:46.402 --> 02:10:48.503]  And folks go, men got mitochondria too.
[02:10:48.863 --> 02:10:50.644]  Mitochondrial DNA.
[02:10:51.044 --> 02:10:53.045]  Not mitochondria, the engine of the cell.
[02:10:53.325 --> 02:10:56.287]  Mitochondrial DNA that only the women have.
[02:10:56.907 --> 02:11:01.349]  Men have a little bit of it at inception, but Dr. Rupp can explain that.
[02:11:02.779 --> 02:11:07.202]  There is a scientific attack going on.
[02:11:07.623 --> 02:11:08.944]  We have eco-science.
[02:11:08.964 --> 02:11:09.804]  It's actually on the floor.
[02:11:09.824 --> 02:11:10.445]  I dropped it earlier.
[02:11:10.545 --> 02:11:11.585]  Somebody comes and gets it for me.
[02:11:12.106 --> 02:11:18.210]  Where the White House science are talks about fluoride in the water to lower your fertility and other compounds.
[02:11:18.250 --> 02:11:19.271]  Fluoride is an adjuvant.
[02:11:19.291 --> 02:11:21.393]  So we're going to be getting to all of that.
[02:11:22.381 --> 02:11:33.063]  In this hour, coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'll segue some too into Obama I's audacious use of executive power in final year.
[02:11:34.183 --> 02:11:38.204]  Will Damascus enemies use their proxies to disrupt Syrian peace talks?
[02:11:38.724 --> 02:11:43.685]  USDA study confirms GM contamination between GM and non-GM crops.
[02:11:44.265 --> 02:11:47.386]  Monsanto works hard to evict Argentine protesters.
[02:11:48.373 --> 02:11:50.435]  Christianity dying in Britain, a new study.
[02:11:50.535 --> 02:11:51.655]  Only Islam growing.
[02:11:52.296 --> 02:11:56.599]  Protesters across the nation demand higher wages to end police brutality on MLKs.
[02:11:56.659 --> 02:11:57.720]  It's like a communist movement.
[02:11:58.661 --> 02:12:01.343]  What you want is jobs and industry, not higher wages.
[02:12:01.603 --> 02:12:03.224]  They got higher wages in Zimbabwe.
[02:12:03.244 --> 02:12:07.727]  What, does it take like a billion Zimbabwe dollars to buy a piece of bread?
[02:12:08.968 --> 02:12:09.669]  People don't get it.
[02:12:11.121 --> 02:12:14.665]  You know, I mean, $5 an hour was like $100 an hour 80 years ago.
[02:12:15.005 --> 02:12:16.166]  People just don't understand.
[02:12:16.446 --> 02:12:18.248]  But they get played by people like Bernie Sanders.
[02:12:18.308 --> 02:12:23.654]  And then, I'm going to get into the huge Islamist wave, what's happening behind that.
[02:12:23.674 --> 02:12:28.298]  But there's a story up on DrugsReport.com of great interest.
[02:12:28.819 --> 02:12:29.600]  Sarah Palin.
[02:12:30.974 --> 02:12:32.216]  Uh, who I like.
[02:12:32.277 --> 02:12:37.125]  She's been demonized, called stupid by the media, by the liberal media, because you know, that's what liberals do, is call women stupid.
[02:12:37.706 --> 02:12:39.930]  And they're talking about him getting her to run as his VP.
[02:12:40.050 --> 02:12:42.274]  I think that would be unstoppable.
[02:12:43.306 --> 02:12:50.169]  Absolutely unstoppable, and I think Sarah Palin would really be, you know, great.
[02:12:50.669 --> 02:12:52.530]  Who knows, Ted Cruz, maybe she'll run with Ted Cruz.
[02:12:52.550 --> 02:13:00.013]  The point is, that will trump, pun intended, the stick of Hillary being a woman, so you're against a woman if you're not for.
[02:13:00.434 --> 02:13:02.194]  I mean, I wish Sarah Palin would have run.
[02:13:02.214 --> 02:13:07.277]  You know, it takes a titan to defeat a titan, to quote Clash of the Titans.
[02:13:08.097 --> 02:13:10.778]  The Gorgon Medusa against the Kraken.
[02:13:13.479 --> 02:13:14.200]  Who is the Kraken?
[02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:14.841]  Who is Medusa?
[02:13:14.881 --> 02:13:22.090]  We all know Hillary is the Medusa in this whole situation, so maybe our Kraken can defeat the Gorgon.
[02:13:22.871 --> 02:13:26.516]  Maybe that's why they tell you at Bilderberg meetings, it's been confirmed, don't look Hillary in the eyes.
[02:13:26.536 --> 02:13:26.997]  I'm serious.
[02:13:27.297 --> 02:13:30.662]  That's how arrogant and out of touch she is, but she's a woman of the people.
[02:13:31.630 --> 02:13:35.431]  Well, I'll take a lady on a snowmobile with a shotgun and a horseback any day over hers.
[02:13:35.471 --> 02:13:36.572]  Pro-gun, pro-liberty.
[02:13:36.892 --> 02:13:38.012]  I mean, she's a little warmongering.
[02:13:38.052 --> 02:13:40.713]  I got problems with her, but I mean, compared to Hillary, whatever.
[02:13:40.853 --> 02:13:42.874]  Hillary's even more warmongering, so what are you gonna do?
[02:13:43.374 --> 02:13:45.235]  But then, below on Drudge Report...
[02:13:48.578 --> 02:13:55.181]  We have an article by Kit Daniels, Davos Insiders, self-driving cars spy on you.
[02:13:56.221 --> 02:13:58.862]  Autonomous cars function as ground-based surveillance drones.
[02:13:59.242 --> 02:14:05.165]  And then multi-source platforms, GM says, Obama wants $6 billion to help force implement this.
[02:14:08.274 --> 02:14:12.279]  Billion dollars to finance rolling them out, and then you don't own your car.
[02:14:12.819 --> 02:14:18.206]  All the sensors are owned by the company that sells the data to the government and taxes you by the miles.
[02:14:18.827 --> 02:14:21.189]  And Deimos even admits that's happening.
[02:14:21.450 --> 02:14:23.432]  That story's up on Infowars.com.
[02:14:23.552 --> 02:14:24.634]  And Drudge, report!
[02:14:25.014 --> 02:14:25.715]  We're good to go.
[02:14:49.557 --> 02:14:52.618]  Now, Dr. Edward Group is here in studio with us.
[02:14:52.638 --> 02:14:57.639]  He's also an Army Special Operations veteran, good buddy of mine, really awake to what's happening.
[02:14:57.659 --> 02:15:11.182]  He's also a nutritionist and many other things, and he is kind of one of the masterminds, along with some other medical doctors and scientists that we use and chemists, and some of the top formulators at three of the biggest organic producers in the country.
[02:15:11.442 --> 02:15:14.523]  We produce our products at four places, but about half our products are produced
[02:15:15.994 --> 02:15:18.477]  With Dr. Group, because his are of the highest quality.
[02:15:18.537 --> 02:15:21.299]  I'm not going to get into a pitch until later, but here's a short one.
[02:15:22.661 --> 02:15:39.637]  A lot of times, we can't have products, sometimes for upwards of six months, as you've seen, because we can't get the wet, super high-quality herbs that are cold-pressed, that actually have the living enzymes and cofactors in them that give you the full response.
[02:15:40.353 --> 02:15:47.795]  A lot of things, most of their budgets in advertising, glitz, hot models, a bunch of bull, a bunch of FDA trouble.
[02:15:47.875 --> 02:15:48.415]  We don't do that.
[02:15:48.435 --> 02:15:49.835]  We don't make claims, any of it.
[02:15:50.095 --> 02:15:52.616]  We just say, here is the product.
[02:15:52.656 --> 02:15:53.656]  Try it out and get ready.
[02:15:54.356 --> 02:15:59.138]  So with us, you'll have a $20 bottle and $8 of it is the product.
[02:15:59.158 --> 02:16:00.318]  You think, well, that's a double markup.
[02:16:00.338 --> 02:16:01.178]  Yeah, we've got to fund ourselves.
[02:16:01.478 --> 02:16:03.078]  The average markup is sevenfold, folks.
[02:16:03.158 --> 02:16:03.899]  Ours is only about 120%.
[02:16:03.979 --> 02:16:05.879]  You're talking $75, $80 a bottle in DNA force of cost.
[02:16:09.758 --> 02:16:11.179]  Then we're selling it for $150.
[02:16:12.380 --> 02:16:14.261]  Leading competitors that aren't even as good are $300, $400, $500.
[02:16:15.442 --> 02:16:24.687]  One of my buddies who's a huge competitive person in sports, I won't say his name, was in here and he said, this has this much bio PQQ in it?
[02:16:24.887 --> 02:16:29.870]  And he goes, I bought a bottle of that with a third the dose of this and it was $60.
[02:16:30.131 --> 02:16:33.813]  And it had a third of the dose, that's just one ingredient.
[02:16:35.285 --> 02:16:40.486]  The CoQ10, all the rest of it, what was it, $12,000 to $14,000 a kilo in DNA force.
[02:16:40.966 --> 02:16:42.046]  That's why it costs that much.
[02:16:42.166 --> 02:16:43.507]  It's really a nutraceutical.
[02:16:44.007 --> 02:16:45.007]  It's been proven.
[02:16:45.607 --> 02:16:48.348]  It's one of the few things out there where you can actually say what it does.
[02:16:49.328 --> 02:16:51.568]  Nerve regrowth, regenerative, I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:16:51.768 --> 02:16:54.349]  You will get numb in parts of your body that have been hurt before when you start taking it.
[02:16:54.369 --> 02:16:54.809]  At least I did.
[02:16:55.049 --> 02:16:56.289]  I heard that and I took it and it blew me away.
[02:16:56.529 --> 02:16:57.609]  So Dr. Group is here.
[02:16:57.649 --> 02:16:59.750]  Before we get into fertility,
[02:17:00.663 --> 02:17:09.734]  That's the big discussion here, and why it's going down so fast, why the sperm are dying, why the women are so infertile, what's happening, a true children of men scenario.
[02:17:09.974 --> 02:17:12.517]  In the few minutes we have, I want to do this because you brought it up, Dr. Ripley.
[02:17:12.537 --> 02:17:14.319]  You'll be here for the next hour and 40 minutes.
[02:17:15.490 --> 02:17:16.651]  Supermail Vitality.
[02:17:17.412 --> 02:17:21.497]  We've had two different formulations where it just gets stronger, where you added more things.
[02:17:21.577 --> 02:17:25.061]  We now have the third generation, but it's the same bottle.
[02:17:25.081 --> 02:17:27.244]  We're not changing the label to call it the third round.
[02:17:27.264 --> 02:17:30.187]  It's like X2 is the second generation.
[02:17:30.227 --> 02:17:31.729]  We ever changed it, I guess it'll be X3.
[02:17:32.089 --> 02:17:35.493]  This is really the X3 of Supermail Vitality.
[02:17:36.454 --> 02:17:37.315]  It has changed.
[02:17:37.515 --> 02:17:38.316]  It's stronger.
[02:17:38.416 --> 02:17:39.717]  It's even more syrupy.
[02:17:40.017 --> 02:17:41.358]  It's even more concentrated.
[02:17:41.378 --> 02:17:43.479]  I'm going to taste some more of it right now.
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:46.402]  What have you done to make it even better?
[02:17:46.422 --> 02:17:53.667]  Well, it's the same herbs, except we just constantly look for better sources of herbs, fresher herbs.
[02:17:53.707 --> 02:17:57.350]  You know, we always want to get the best of the best of the best.
[02:17:57.410 --> 02:18:04.796]  So anytime you're dealing with any type of liquid extraction, herbal extractions, you're always going to have changes in taste,
[02:18:05.416 --> 02:18:06.437]  We're good to go!
[02:18:24.109 --> 02:18:27.172]  Well, this stuff tastes like five times stronger.
[02:18:27.192 --> 02:18:27.853]  What on earth?
[02:18:28.033 --> 02:18:31.957]  Well, because the Tongkat Ali is actually one of the worst tasting herbs.
[02:18:31.997 --> 02:18:33.319]  You know, you got to remember these.
[02:18:33.339 --> 02:18:34.039]  I like how it makes me feel.
[02:18:34.059 --> 02:18:36.882]  What we want to do is we want to concentrate it in the end result.
[02:18:36.902 --> 02:18:37.723]  That's what we're looking for.
[02:18:37.743 --> 02:18:39.385]  Doesn't really taste bad, but it's got a rich flavor.
[02:18:39.605 --> 02:18:43.269]  So, I mean, don't be disturbed if you taste an herb and it tastes one way this time.
[02:18:43.289 --> 02:18:44.069]  Makes your mouth tingle.
[02:18:44.089 --> 02:18:45.531]  Your body knows it's getting something there.
[02:18:45.731 --> 02:18:45.991]  It does.
[02:18:46.031 --> 02:18:48.692]  And the next time you order it, it might taste a little bit different.
[02:18:48.732 --> 02:18:51.533]  But just to let everybody know, it's the same process.
[02:18:51.573 --> 02:18:53.134]  We're not changing up any of the herbs.
[02:18:53.694 --> 02:18:54.795]  It's actually stronger.
[02:18:54.835 --> 02:18:55.775]  It's more effective.
[02:18:56.115 --> 02:19:00.497]  And, you know, don't return your bottle if you get it because it tastes different.
[02:19:00.537 --> 02:19:01.918]  It's just that's the way.
[02:19:02.098 --> 02:19:02.418]  Good.
[02:19:03.058 --> 02:19:05.200]  Herbal extraction supplement.
[02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:07.263]  This isn't alcohol with three drops of herbs.
[02:19:07.303 --> 02:19:10.706]  This is like where you just continue to cold press it until it's a syrup.
[02:19:10.987 --> 02:19:16.312]  If you have a good supplement and you have a good process, then you expect a little bit of change on each batch.
[02:19:16.693 --> 02:19:22.139]  Because even though you're doing the exact... What you're saying is, you were telling me off air, this vintage is stronger.
[02:19:22.619 --> 02:19:22.839]  Yes.
[02:19:22.859 --> 02:19:24.902]  I know you can't quantify it, but how much stronger?
[02:19:26.175 --> 02:19:29.738]  I would say probably 10% stronger.
[02:19:29.758 --> 02:19:30.159]  Yeah.
[02:19:30.519 --> 02:19:31.139]  Well, I know this.
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:35.464]  We got 15% off Super Metal Vitality when you get it with X2 today.
[02:19:35.504 --> 02:19:36.805]  Both of them are 15% off.
[02:19:37.045 --> 02:19:38.167]  That's the special this week.
[02:19:38.287 --> 02:19:41.250]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:19:41.290 --> 02:19:43.252]  Your purchase, again, makes it all possible.
[02:19:43.592 --> 02:19:44.513]  You're going to have the floor.
[02:19:44.813 --> 02:19:47.615]  I'm always bad, buttoning in, backing you up when you say stuff.
[02:19:47.635 --> 02:19:57.641]  We're going to be flashing news articles on screen constantly about IQs going down, about, you know, all the things that are happening, about fertility going down.
[02:19:58.282 --> 02:20:00.443]  For TV viewers, for radio listeners, we'll be going over the headlines.
[02:20:00.463 --> 02:20:02.765]  You've got a lot of mainstream studies and articles.
[02:20:03.085 --> 02:20:03.725]  Fertility.
[02:20:03.985 --> 02:20:06.387]  How do you fight back against what they're artificially doing?
[02:20:06.667 --> 02:20:08.989]  Some of it by accident, others by design.
[02:20:11.053 --> 02:20:12.434]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[02:20:12.875 --> 02:20:14.837]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[02:20:15.397 --> 02:20:19.021]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[02:20:19.261 --> 02:20:27.729]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[02:20:28.069 --> 02:20:31.352]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[02:20:32.233 --> 02:20:35.314]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[02:20:35.354 --> 02:20:39.976]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[02:20:40.717 --> 02:20:44.938]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[02:20:45.659 --> 02:20:48.460]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:51.041]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[02:20:51.921 --> 02:20:58.169]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.

[02:23:19.957 --> 02:23:20.377]  I think so.

[02:23:40.481 --> 02:23:42.061]  We're introducing the best yet.
[02:23:42.181 --> 02:23:46.123]  The brand new ProPure ProMax High Performance Shower Filter.

[02:24:16.792 --> 02:24:22.195]  By the way, guys, I'm not getting off into a plug fest, and I'm going to hand this over to Dr. Gripper, and I'll give him the floor for much of the hour.
[02:24:22.215 --> 02:24:25.877]  And he's into the next hour with Anthony Giussiardi in the same studio.
[02:24:27.378 --> 02:24:37.323]  But I just heard my own ad for the ProPure ProMax four-stage shower filter that literally cuts out or reduces things to non-detectable levels across the board.
[02:24:37.883 --> 02:24:38.544]  So amazing.
[02:24:39.044 --> 02:24:42.786]  I forgot, it's not just 10% off with promo code WATER, it's free shipping.
[02:24:44.438 --> 02:24:49.722]  So I'm plugging stuff on air and not even telling you how good the deals are with all the stuff we hear about that's in the water.
[02:24:49.982 --> 02:24:56.447]  I love the fact that John P. Holdren, the eugenicist, the exterminist, just got hacked by teen activists.
[02:24:57.308 --> 02:24:58.208]  Guaranteed they're listeners.
[02:24:58.588 --> 02:24:59.749]  I mean, this guy's a true villain.
[02:24:59.769 --> 02:25:02.732]  But I'm going to shut up now and get into how we strike back.
[02:25:03.492 --> 02:25:05.293]  Can we mitigate all the stuff in the environment?
[02:25:05.774 --> 02:25:07.895]  Can we always miss all the GMO?
[02:25:07.955 --> 02:25:08.556]  No, it's in the air.
[02:25:09.909 --> 02:25:11.170]  Can we filter everything out?
[02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:13.711]  No, but we can reduce it and live longer, be healthier.
[02:25:14.071 --> 02:25:16.272]  If not for ourselves, how about for our children?
[02:25:16.613 --> 02:25:17.773]  But what about fertility?
[02:25:19.234 --> 02:25:20.735]  World fertility is plummeting.
[02:25:21.820 --> 02:25:25.743]  Now that Brazil's taking on vaccines and Western medicine, they're plummeting.
[02:25:26.123 --> 02:25:27.084]  Breast cancer's way up.
[02:25:27.424 --> 02:25:31.027]  I mean, you follow this, it's like day following night.
[02:25:31.347 --> 02:25:34.829]  So Dr. Group, this is about six minutes of this segment, long segment coming up.
[02:25:35.210 --> 02:25:42.155]  The war on fertility, why is it happening, and what are natural things, freely available, that are known to boost it?
[02:25:44.087 --> 02:26:04.355]  This is something that's been happening for quite some time now and in order for, it's really a sad scenario because in order to prepare your body and all the people that fall in love and get married and want to have children, one of the most devastating things to relationships right now is not being able to have children.
[02:26:04.875 --> 02:26:10.478]  It's separating the male and the female and the female thinks that it's them that the problem is.
[02:26:11.417 --> 02:26:20.962]  The male doesn't really know what's going on, and now there's these fertility clinics that are popping up all over the world, all over the United States, and it's a big money game.
[02:26:21.002 --> 02:26:23.243]  It's like cancer and chemotherapy and radiation.
[02:26:23.784 --> 02:26:25.324]  It's the same for fertility.
[02:26:25.785 --> 02:26:29.627]  But in order to be, and no one is addressing the root cause of the problem.
[02:26:29.767 --> 02:26:35.290]  Why do we have such a fertility problem in America and all over the world today?
[02:26:36.411 --> 02:26:38.112]  The doctors, they don't know.
[02:26:38.872 --> 02:26:40.573]  The scientists, they don't know.
[02:26:40.613 --> 02:26:42.333]  The pharmaceutical companies know.
[02:26:42.373 --> 02:26:44.394]  The big chemical companies know what it is.
[02:26:44.414 --> 02:26:48.796]  It's designed as part of a population control scheme.
[02:26:49.336 --> 02:26:52.797]  But, of course, people like us know what the situation is.
[02:26:52.837 --> 02:26:59.760]  I mean, your body has to be aligned spiritually, mentally, physically.
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:08.682]  Your body has to be clean in order for conception to occur, for a baby to come in this world.
[02:27:09.182 --> 02:27:19.805]  And it's so hard when you have the main causative actions that are out there that are preventing fertility to happen.
[02:27:19.905 --> 02:27:20.865]  And it's really simple.
[02:27:21.345 --> 02:27:25.026]  What you have is an attack on the endocrine system.
[02:27:25.626 --> 02:27:28.888]  Most people, most doctors, you can say, hey, what's the endocrine system?
[02:27:29.289 --> 02:27:29.709]  What is it?
[02:27:29.769 --> 02:27:30.450]  What does it do?
[02:27:31.050 --> 02:27:32.251]  And most people don't even know.
[02:27:32.711 --> 02:27:35.914]  But the endocrine system in your body is a vital system.
[02:27:36.074 --> 02:27:50.785]  Your endocrine system is made up of glands, hormone-secreting glands, your pineal gland, your pituitary gland, your thyroid, your parathyroid, your pancreas, your adrenal glands.
[02:27:51.673 --> 02:27:57.975]  Your GI tract, which is the number one and the biggest endocrine gland in the body.
[02:27:58.395 --> 02:28:09.459]  And when you focus on why we have infertility, why we have sterility, why we have depression, anxiety, and many other problems today... And cancer exploding!
[02:28:10.299 --> 02:28:12.441]  You have to track it to one simple thing.
[02:28:12.561 --> 02:28:15.244]  It's an attack on the endocrine system.
[02:28:15.804 --> 02:28:17.425]  People are getting thyroid cancer.
[02:28:17.465 --> 02:28:18.967]  The thyroid is malfunctioning.
[02:28:19.127 --> 02:28:20.909]  Oh, by the way, guess what?
[02:28:21.189 --> 02:28:25.453]  The testes and the ovaries are part of the endocrine system.
[02:28:26.184 --> 02:28:32.707]  And again, never a question why is cancer exploding, never a question why they say in England half the public will have it by 2024.
[02:28:32.988 --> 02:28:33.848]  That was London Independent.
[02:28:34.388 --> 02:28:37.330]  There's no discussion why is breast cancer up 3-4 thousand percent.
[02:28:37.810 --> 02:28:38.911]  There's just no discussion.
[02:28:39.611 --> 02:28:40.531]  No, no discussion.
[02:28:40.591 --> 02:28:43.393]  So, what is it that's attacking the endocrine system?
[02:28:43.473 --> 02:28:45.194]  Oh, John P. Holdren told us, he's killing us.
[02:28:45.694 --> 02:28:46.294]  Yeah, well...
[02:28:47.955 --> 02:29:13.390]  All you have to do is breathe the air, drink the water, eat the food, and watch the media, listen to all the negativity on the air, and you're going to be stressed and all the things that are going to be affecting the endocrine system, but really the main things, and this is, listen, I can give people some suggestions here on how to get pregnant, probably in a short period of time, because it's not that hard to repair the endocrine system when you know the root cause of the problem.
[02:29:14.010 --> 02:29:16.612]  Once you know the root cause... The root cause is I need to come over to your house.
[02:29:17.452 --> 02:29:19.894]  No, the root cause, you don't even need to come over to my house.
[02:29:19.914 --> 02:29:21.976]  It's a joke, it's a joke, I know, it's a joke.
[02:29:22.496 --> 02:29:25.059]  I'm not, I know, I got three kids, you got, we got three kids, right?
[02:29:25.079 --> 02:29:25.139]  Two?
[02:29:25.339 --> 02:29:26.940]  No, I have two kids, yeah.
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:27.781]  It's a horrible joke.
[02:29:28.627 --> 02:29:29.848]  They made it in the back of the day.
[02:29:29.888 --> 02:29:32.650]  They were like, Alex, we can just send you over to somebody's house if there's a problem.
[02:29:33.370 --> 02:29:34.071]  It's a joke, folks.
[02:29:34.091 --> 02:29:34.851]  It's a Christian show.
[02:29:34.931 --> 02:29:35.312]  I apologize.
[02:29:35.332 --> 02:29:39.915]  That's because you're drinking a whole bottle of Supermail Vitality every single day.
[02:29:40.095 --> 02:29:41.095]  That's a joke.
[02:29:41.436 --> 02:29:51.682]  And we know how high your testosterone levels can get on a daily basis, which is not a bad thing, considering the fact that most men out there have low testosterone and low hormone levels, and we'll get back to that in the next segment.
[02:29:51.702 --> 02:29:52.523]  Which is all about us.
[02:29:52.563 --> 02:29:53.784]  And then the women are hyper-feminine.
[02:29:53.804 --> 02:29:54.044]  They're like,
[02:29:54.144 --> 02:29:54.424]  Great!
[02:29:54.525 --> 02:29:56.708]  No, no, that's why you then get breast cancer so quick.
[02:29:57.028 --> 02:30:00.032]  We'll be back, because a 30-year-old woman might have a 70-year-old woman's breast.
[02:30:00.553 --> 02:30:02.155]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.077 --> 02:30:05.761]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:11.698 --> 02:30:19.503]  Serving as a microcosm of the Obama administration, a real estate developer partially demolished the reputed birthplace of the Bill of Rights.
[02:30:19.764 --> 02:30:29.891]  The developer, Triple Crown Corp., secured a permit to demolish a two-story stone building, formerly known as James Bell Tavern, in Silver Springs Township, Pennsylvania.
[02:30:30.091 --> 02:30:38.977]  By the time a third of the building was destroyed, the city stopped the demolition because officials realized the Bill of Rights was conceived at the tavern during a 1788 meeting.
[02:30:40.578 --> 02:30:48.746]  How appropriate that part of the building has been torn down while other parts remain, commenter WC Handy wrote to the local Sentinel newspaper.
[02:30:49.106 --> 02:30:52.489]  We have a Congress that is so intent on destroying the Bill of Rights.
[02:30:52.749 --> 02:30:57.614]  The building as it stands now is rather indicative of the current state of our Bill of Rights.
[02:30:57.934 --> 02:31:02.298]  Why not leave the building as it is to serve as a reminder to us all, he added.
[02:31:02.538 --> 02:31:05.681]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.

[02:33:19.695 --> 02:33:25.963]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.971 --> 02:33:30.192]  Look at these headlines!
[02:33:30.573 --> 02:33:33.796]  Shelf-driving cars function as ground-based surveillance drones.
[02:33:33.996 --> 02:33:35.757]  Under that, mainstream news.
[02:33:35.998 --> 02:33:37.479]  Humanity's last century.
[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:41.062]  Re-engineering will lead to creation of new species.
[02:33:42.284 --> 02:33:44.926]  How many times you heard me talk about that?
[02:33:45.427 --> 02:33:48.890]  A lot of you that have been listening in Central Texas for 20 years.
[02:33:51.584 --> 02:33:56.667]  How many times, folks, have you heard us warn of that over and over again?
[02:33:56.687 --> 02:34:01.310]  Because that's what the elite believe that they are building.
[02:34:01.930 --> 02:34:04.652]  That's the system they say they're setting up.
[02:34:04.732 --> 02:34:05.432]  The Daily Mail.
[02:34:06.113 --> 02:34:10.996]  Could this be humanity's last century experts re-engineering our children believe the creation of a new species?
[02:34:11.556 --> 02:34:14.660]  Well, they're already saying, oh, because two men can't have a baby together.
[02:34:15.001 --> 02:34:18.405]  They don't want to have it with a woman that volunteers to have the sperm implanted.
[02:34:18.686 --> 02:34:20.909]  We have to splice the two men together.
[02:34:21.229 --> 02:34:23.632]  But because that doesn't work, we're going to splice three men.
[02:34:23.973 --> 02:34:25.054]  That's not even a human!
[02:34:25.655 --> 02:34:27.658]  And then because they make it about gay rights...
[02:34:28.599 --> 02:34:30.520]  They've now made a frankenperson.
[02:34:31.121 --> 02:34:35.344]  They're now rolling out everywhere that, oh, farms all over the U.S.
[02:34:35.364 --> 02:34:39.347]  They're gestating humanoids inside cows, pigs, and sheep.
[02:34:39.567 --> 02:34:41.388]  We harvest their tissue.
[02:34:41.408 --> 02:34:41.468]  See?
[02:34:41.488 --> 02:34:47.732]  Because we don't care about each other, we don't care about ourselves, we care about NFL.
[02:34:47.973 --> 02:34:49.093]  We're experts on NFL.
[02:34:49.774 --> 02:34:51.995]  And so who cares if there's chimera bases?
[02:34:54.657 --> 02:34:56.579]  Imagine what we don't know.
[02:34:57.845 --> 02:35:00.226]  Imagine what else is going on.
[02:35:00.486 --> 02:35:01.186]  It goes on and on.
[02:35:01.206 --> 02:35:01.486]  Look at this.
[02:35:01.566 --> 02:35:06.668]  Sperm and eggs carry genetic memories of parents' health well before conception.
[02:35:08.569 --> 02:35:10.229]  And so the egg and the sperm are communicating.
[02:35:10.249 --> 02:35:11.370]  You talk about magic.
[02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:14.651]  And our government is just jacking with these corporations with this.
[02:35:14.931 --> 02:35:20.873]  They have been having no idea of what they're doing because just randomly discovering things and giving rise to all these new super illnesses.
[02:35:21.113 --> 02:35:22.814]  We're going back to Dr. Group here in just a moment.
[02:35:24.096 --> 02:35:26.720]  And we have folks that have questions for Dr. Group.
[02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:28.543]  We'll get to some this hour and right into the next.
[02:35:28.583 --> 02:35:33.250]  George, Angelo, Steve, Rick, Doug, and others, toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:35:33.270 --> 02:35:39.180]  I'm going to get to these here pretty soon, but briefly, in Donald Trump land,
[02:35:40.981 --> 02:35:47.764]  We're busy fighting with each other over there not being any black directors or black people in the Oscars.
[02:35:48.805 --> 02:35:49.905]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:35:49.925 --> 02:35:52.346]  I think something's going on there.
[02:35:53.227 --> 02:35:56.208]  Hollywood is very focused on itself.
[02:35:56.668 --> 02:35:59.570]  They're always pushing equality and integration.
[02:36:00.572 --> 02:36:03.853]  But you go to Hollywood and the elite circles, it's white.
[02:36:04.493 --> 02:36:08.594]  It's white as the new born white babies behind, as the driven snow.
[02:36:09.334 --> 02:36:10.915]  And it's beyond that.
[02:36:11.155 --> 02:36:12.235]  You go see movies.
[02:36:12.755 --> 02:36:16.236]  It's either movies for black people or movies for white people or movies for Hispanics.
[02:36:16.616 --> 02:36:18.717]  They're all about balkanization.
[02:36:18.977 --> 02:36:19.957]  Then they play on that.
[02:36:19.977 --> 02:36:21.037]  I think there's something there.
[02:36:21.057 --> 02:36:27.219]  But while you're busy boycotting that, because I mean, I've seen some movies that, you know, deserve it.
[02:36:31.297 --> 02:36:32.057]  I'm digressing.
[02:36:34.378 --> 02:36:37.639]  The point is it's a diversion from how humanity itself is under attack.
[02:36:37.999 --> 02:36:43.642]  Strong like John Wayne, Donald Trump holds campaign event in front of John Wayne statue.
[02:36:44.082 --> 02:36:53.685]  And by the way, we're going to edit this, a separate video of just group on fertility this hour and next all together informationally to put out for folks that want specifically know about that.
[02:36:53.825 --> 02:36:57.727]  You're about to have the floor of the rest of the segment, but I want folks to know, but I've just got to finish some of this news.
[02:36:58.769 --> 02:37:03.550]  Strong like John Wayne, Donald Trump holds campaign event in front of John Wayne statue.
[02:37:03.570 --> 02:37:04.550]  I think it's a great idea.
[02:37:04.570 --> 02:37:06.630]  A nice little stunt.
[02:37:07.571 --> 02:37:13.812]  But speaking of that, Trump, as you know, tweeted a photo of an Infowars.com Hillary for Prison shirt a few weeks ago.
[02:37:14.332 --> 02:37:17.512]  And we had gotten a bunch made at the end of the year, but it's a limited edition.
[02:37:17.552 --> 02:37:18.752]  When those sell out, no more.
[02:37:19.013 --> 02:37:21.313]  There are some sizes left because they did do a big order.
[02:37:22.393 --> 02:37:26.894]  If you want the Hillary for Prison shirt on the front, 2016 on the back, it says
[02:37:27.634 --> 02:37:29.416]  Legalize Freedom, Infowars.com.
[02:37:29.436 --> 02:37:34.122]  We can show you that photo of the tweet and the photo of the young lady there wearing the shirt.
[02:37:34.202 --> 02:37:37.586]  It's gotten a lot of attention around the country with people wearing it.
[02:37:38.067 --> 02:37:40.830]  And yes, when Trump says something about anybody, we might as well play it.
[02:37:41.391 --> 02:37:45.315]  I've been told that Trump liked the interview he did, that he would like to come back on it sometime.
[02:37:45.996 --> 02:37:47.917]  I personally wanted to send him a thank you note.
[02:37:48.017 --> 02:37:48.877]  I haven't done it yet.
[02:37:49.317 --> 02:37:50.457]  I've got his personal address.
[02:37:50.557 --> 02:37:52.258]  I'm going to do that probably today or tomorrow.
[02:37:52.338 --> 02:37:53.398]  I've been meaning it for weeks.
[02:37:53.758 --> 02:37:55.339]  And then he's probably going to be coming back on.
[02:37:55.759 --> 02:37:59.860]  But regardless, a lot of folks are bringing up InfoWars on the campaign trail.
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:00.820]  That's great.
[02:38:00.980 --> 02:38:02.561]  Also bring up Hillary for prison.
[02:38:03.061 --> 02:38:09.023]  But here's Donald Trump at an event last night being asked, hey, InfoWars, are you going to go back on the show?
[02:38:09.043 --> 02:38:09.943]  And this is what he had.
[02:38:09.963 --> 02:38:12.083]  He kind of nodded his head and said, oh, yeah, that's a nice guy.
[02:38:12.364 --> 02:38:13.164]  He liked doing the show.
[02:38:13.204 --> 02:38:13.624]  Here's the clip.
[02:38:14.542 --> 02:38:15.163]  Kevin, go ahead.
[02:38:15.224 --> 02:38:15.965]  Give it to somebody.
[02:38:19.994 --> 02:38:20.735]  Alex Jones.
[02:38:21.056 --> 02:38:22.178]  He was a nice guy, actually.
[02:38:22.218 --> 02:38:22.639]  You like him?
[02:38:23.996 --> 02:38:25.257]  Oh, that's good.
[02:38:25.377 --> 02:38:25.998]  Alex Jones.
[02:38:26.058 --> 02:38:26.458]  Nice guy.
[02:38:26.478 --> 02:38:27.159]  Go ahead.
[02:38:27.619 --> 02:38:27.920]  Hi.
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:29.281]  How are you?
[02:38:29.361 --> 02:38:29.941]  Whatever.
[02:38:30.222 --> 02:38:34.485]  I mean, what I really like is he's tweeted him four or three or four times and plugged the t-shirt.
[02:38:34.525 --> 02:38:39.510]  But, you know, it makes me like Trump more, obviously, that they ended up reaching out to us to have him on the show.
[02:38:39.530 --> 02:38:40.411]  I'm not bragging.
[02:38:40.431 --> 02:38:43.934]  I didn't even try to think to get Trump on because there's such bureaucracy around it.
[02:38:44.354 --> 02:38:45.335]  Like, I didn't want to get Ram.
[02:38:45.355 --> 02:38:46.336]  I didn't want to get Ram Paul on.
[02:38:46.596 --> 02:38:47.477]  You know, they contacted us.
[02:38:47.497 --> 02:38:52.662]  I'm not bragging, it's just people say, oh, the media goes, oh look, you know, Suns is sitting on your show.
[02:38:52.682 --> 02:38:53.262]  I mean, whatever.
[02:38:53.483 --> 02:38:54.604]  The listeners want info.
[02:38:54.644 --> 02:38:56.045]  They want to hear about infertility.
[02:38:56.445 --> 02:38:57.646]  Okay, Trump's popular.
[02:38:57.767 --> 02:38:58.808]  Yeah, he got a lot of news.
[02:38:59.408 --> 02:39:00.870]  I just want to know, is he for real or not?
[02:39:00.890 --> 02:39:05.774]  And let me briefly ask you, what is your gut feeling on Trump?
[02:39:05.794 --> 02:39:07.356]  And then you've got the floor on infertility.
[02:39:07.416 --> 02:39:08.537]  Recap, go back into it.
[02:39:11.671 --> 02:39:12.812]  Yeah, I watched the interview.
[02:39:12.832 --> 02:39:20.654]  I have to say that out of all the candidates, I would probably put Trump as a frontrunner.
[02:39:20.674 --> 02:39:31.797]  I look at the back end of different things too and really understand how the government is run with the elite organizations and how people are put in office.
[02:39:33.678 --> 02:39:38.262]  I kind of asked myself, will they ever allow someone like Trump to actually get into office?
[02:39:39.343 --> 02:39:40.685]  I think he has some good ideas.
[02:39:40.965 --> 02:39:43.968]  And you know, anybody else that's out there running?
[02:39:44.008 --> 02:39:48.532]  I mean, obviously, we've been in a devastating scenario in this country.
[02:39:48.652 --> 02:39:50.274]  We have a collapsing economy.
[02:39:50.334 --> 02:39:52.776]  We have a collapsing health care system.
[02:39:53.257 --> 02:39:55.459]  You know, everything is collapsing, including
[02:39:56.439 --> 02:39:58.740]  But Obama said the State of the Union is the best ever.
[02:39:58.980 --> 02:39:59.420]  Of course!
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:02.701]  We have all these jobs available, we have all this stuff, everything.
[02:40:02.721 --> 02:40:05.702]  It's probably pretty nice on Air Force One, you know, on red carpets for him.
[02:40:05.722 --> 02:40:06.083]  Exactly.
[02:40:06.103 --> 02:40:07.863]  They can spend as much money as they want.
[02:40:07.943 --> 02:40:08.643]  Nobody cares.
[02:40:08.704 --> 02:40:10.464]  They just start printing more money.
[02:40:10.524 --> 02:40:18.507]  But everybody else that has to suffer is the ones that we care about and the ones that we want to educate and let them know what they need to look out for.
[02:40:18.587 --> 02:40:21.628]  Speaking of fertility and infertility... Yeah, get into that.
[02:40:21.988 --> 02:40:23.629]  Let's break it down now.
[02:40:24.609 --> 02:40:36.057]  Uh, what's causing the infertility, the bisphenol A, the glyphosates, all of it, admittedly, you know, absolutely attacks fertility, attacks the cells, not just the, you know, the reproductive glands and reproductive organs.
[02:40:36.537 --> 02:40:45.323]  Uh, what can you do to A, mitigate, stop getting those chemicals as much, but also known compounds that we're also deficient in to massively boost infertility?
[02:40:45.583 --> 02:40:55.821]  What would you tell a woman, you know, let's say a 30-year-old woman with a 30-year-old husband, this is a real couple out there, who are looking at, you know, having children and have kind of been trying and it isn't happening?
[02:40:56.502 --> 02:41:04.106]  Well, the first thing I always tell people when I counsel them for infertility is, you need to recognize the things that are causing your infertility.
[02:41:04.507 --> 02:41:07.168]  And the number one thing is going to be the xenoestrogens.
[02:41:07.208 --> 02:41:13.131]  And that starts with, those are estrogen mimickers, and we're living in a society where we have too much estrogen.
[02:41:13.532 --> 02:41:19.215]  And those xenoestrogens are what contaminates and destroys the endocrine system.
[02:41:20.151 --> 02:41:42.549]  One of the things we talk about a lot here is iodine, and that's one of the things that we've found that all the endocrine glands need and want, and these xenoestrogens and these compounds that affect fertility, whether it's low sperm count, whether it's damage to the ovaries, damage to the hormone system in the women, all of these things are estrogen mimickers or
[02:41:43.530 --> 02:41:48.753]  Compounds that damage either the thyroid, the pineal, the pituitary, the adrenal, and everything else.
[02:41:48.773 --> 02:41:50.494]  And doctor, folks are going to say, what are those?
[02:41:50.534 --> 02:41:54.517]  Well, bisphenol A is in almost all the printer ink, almost all the plastic.
[02:41:55.337 --> 02:41:57.859]  By design, they admit it's to make us infertile.
[02:41:58.419 --> 02:41:58.959]  Expanding.
[02:41:59.239 --> 02:42:00.520]  What is the one of the top ones?
[02:42:00.860 --> 02:42:03.242]  Fluoride is obviously a xenoestrogen.
[02:42:03.262 --> 02:42:03.962]  Break that down.
[02:42:04.222 --> 02:42:07.604]  That's why the White House science czar says they put it in the water.
[02:42:07.884 --> 02:42:10.246]  So believe it or not... Don't drink trap water.
[02:42:10.666 --> 02:42:16.111]  Don't drink tap water because all of these chemicals are in tap water.
[02:42:16.371 --> 02:42:19.554]  Matter of fact, a lot of pharmaceutical drugs have phthalates.
[02:42:19.614 --> 02:42:29.423]  Now, phthalates are a plastic compound and that's one of the top 10 xenoestrogens or endocrine... So you're saying Chicken McNuggets that have a plasticizer in them, I shouldn't be giving my children plastic?
[02:42:30.103 --> 02:42:32.626]  If you want to have a baby later, then no.
[02:42:32.926 --> 02:42:34.648]  You mean plastic is not good for you?
[02:42:34.668 --> 02:42:41.714]  Phthalates are actually fragrances, and 75% of the American public actually use fragrant compounds in their homes.
[02:42:42.395 --> 02:42:46.759]  So that's one of the things... The air fresheners, those are little... Those are little Doc Al gas...
[02:42:47.620 --> 02:42:48.240]  Gas chambers.
[02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:53.962]  Any fragrant in cosmetics, any fragrant in skin lotions, any perfume, conditioner.
[02:42:53.982 --> 02:42:55.883]  That women just dunk themselves in.
[02:42:56.063 --> 02:43:01.685]  Yes, that they lather all over their body are, and that's one, that's a loophole because.
[02:43:01.925 --> 02:43:09.988]  And they wonder why even for young women their periods are bonking around like ping pong balls because they're just dunking themselves in artificial and plant.
[02:43:10.868 --> 02:43:11.308]  Estrogens.
[02:43:11.449 --> 02:43:11.649]  Right.
[02:43:11.829 --> 02:43:18.014]  All of this stuff that we talk about are disrupting the hormones in men and disrupting the hormones in females.
[02:43:18.354 --> 02:43:23.438]  And the phthalates, fragrances, we don't even know what those chemicals are.
[02:43:23.518 --> 02:43:24.699]  They're proprietary.
[02:43:24.719 --> 02:43:25.960]  They're proprietary.
[02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:28.783]  These companies aren't required to list these.
[02:43:28.803 --> 02:43:29.143]  That's right.
[02:43:29.183 --> 02:43:32.385]  They've got laws passed that you don't get to know what it is.
[02:43:33.126 --> 02:43:48.511]  So the phthalates are a big problem because they make plastic softer, but the next big problem is the use of herbicides and pesticides, and that's going to be your glyphosate, which is sprayed on all the vegetables, your Roundup that you have in your backyard that's being sprayed everywhere, the
[02:43:50.732 --> 02:43:58.257]  The compounds in these are so damaging that they can literally turn off your DNA and affect you for generations and generations and generations.
[02:43:58.297 --> 02:43:59.357]  What shows those articles?
[02:43:59.397 --> 02:44:00.678]  That's mainstream news.
[02:44:00.938 --> 02:44:04.621]  What you were saying earlier, though, the sperm and egg carry genetic memories.
[02:44:04.821 --> 02:44:14.106]  They found out now that this means that parents' bad habits, such as poor diet and drinking too much alcohol, could be passed on to their children, even if they're healthy during pregnancy.
[02:44:14.146 --> 02:44:15.167]  That's what the Bible said!
[02:44:15.247 --> 02:44:17.149]  The sins of the parents are passed on.
[02:44:17.389 --> 02:44:17.809]  Exactly.
[02:44:17.890 --> 02:44:24.576]  Now we actually have proof that the memories and the actions are passed on to the cells.
[02:44:24.916 --> 02:44:26.938]  Not just the DNA and the genes.
[02:44:27.179 --> 02:44:29.261]  And we'll put that article on screen for viewers.
[02:44:29.341 --> 02:44:30.362]  We'll put that article on screen.
[02:44:30.402 --> 02:44:32.243]  That means that it's so important.
[02:44:32.924 --> 02:44:38.469]  Part of our fertility program is that cleansing the body for three to six months before you actually try to conceive.
[02:44:38.489 --> 02:44:39.550]  And that just makes sense.
[02:44:39.931 --> 02:44:41.492]  That's how they did it in the ancient days.
[02:44:41.532 --> 02:44:46.437]  That's how anybody who's sensible... And this is from the University of Alberta.
[02:44:47.469 --> 02:45:03.861]  University of Alberta, that's why every ancient culture, before a maiden got married to her mate, and of course then she was a virgin, she'd usually get pregnant in just a few moon cycles, that's what women are based on, all of us are, that she would then go for like a month away and purify herself in the hills, the mountains, and only eat herbs.
[02:45:04.061 --> 02:45:06.403]  Every culture, because they didn't want to have a deformed baby.
[02:45:06.863 --> 02:45:19.565]  Yep, and that's how you, the good thing about the human body is it repairs itself really fast and that's why we focus on cleansing the gut and bringing that microbiome back into the gut because it is the largest endocrine gland.
[02:45:19.605 --> 02:45:23.646]  So really what we're trying to do with fertility is repair the endocrine system.
[02:45:23.686 --> 02:45:29.407]  You give the iodine which is utilized by the ovaries, the testes, the thyroid.
[02:45:29.447 --> 02:45:34.108]  It's the good halogen that they take out of the salt and they put the bad fluoride in because they love us.
[02:45:34.208 --> 02:45:34.948]  Well guess what?
[02:45:35.188 --> 02:45:39.094]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, all endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
[02:45:39.134 --> 02:45:42.619]  You were right when you said the water is the leading source of infertility.
[02:45:42.979 --> 02:45:47.746]  Because in water you have aluminum particles, you have fluoride, all these are
[02:45:48.835 --> 02:45:50.636]  Harmful endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
[02:45:50.676 --> 02:45:53.258]  You have all the pesticide and herbicide runoff in water.
[02:45:53.278 --> 02:45:54.659]  You have arsenic in water.
[02:45:55.079 --> 02:45:59.803]  You have perchlorate, which is rocket fuel that ends up seeping down and going into the water supply.
[02:45:59.843 --> 02:46:03.305]  You have the atrazine in the water supply.
[02:46:03.325 --> 02:46:09.149]  95% of the milk and lettuce in the country is contaminated with perchlorate.
[02:46:09.469 --> 02:46:14.113]  98% of women that had their breast milk tested had levels of DDT and perchlorate.
[02:46:14.173 --> 02:46:17.055]  It was like 99% of women tested over and over again have glyphosate in their milk.
[02:46:17.495 --> 02:46:29.764]  Right, and an unknown fact is that arsenic, which is in the water supply practically all over the United States, is extremely restricted to fat.
[02:46:29.804 --> 02:46:32.826]  It basically shuts down your fat metabolism and your carbohydrates.
[02:46:32.846 --> 02:46:40.831]  And so, exactly, they've got all these studies that nobody talks about, but you've got, you know, right here today, people can look them up, where you wonder why folks get so fat.
[02:46:41.091 --> 02:46:45.815]  People back in my grandfather's had pie after every meal, and huge chicken fried steaks, and they were all
[02:46:46.295 --> 02:46:47.076]  That's right.
[02:46:59.505 --> 02:47:01.906]  The solution, and the parabens too, we didn't talk about.
[02:47:01.946 --> 02:47:06.849]  But parabens, and believe it or not, I mean, we talk about the living defense here, the introduction of living defense.
[02:47:07.409 --> 02:47:20.857]  A lot of people don't know that people are infested with harmful organisms, and harmful organisms, which are, can be bacteria, viruses, worms, anything that lives in your body, that feeds off your body.
[02:47:21.117 --> 02:47:22.778]  They are then defecating toxins.
[02:47:23.158 --> 02:47:33.441]  Isopropyl alcohol, phenol, formaldehyde, and those are endocrine-disrupting chemicals, so it all really comes back to an attack on your endocrine system.
[02:47:33.481 --> 02:47:45.905]  Well, my biggest thing in reading the studies is you people put food in the microwave, and it like cooks it, or you get out, even not fast food, a good restaurant will put it in plastic, and the plastic, the styrofoam's like melted, and I looked it up, but I've tasted it before.
[02:47:45.965 --> 02:47:48.666]  I just can't do that where I'm eating all these chemicals.
[02:47:49.534 --> 02:48:03.828]  Plastics are the worst and you know because BPA was taken out of most bottles and baby bottles that doesn't mean that they don't still contain phthalates and doesn't mean they don't contain BPS and other forms of plasticizers in there.
[02:48:04.169 --> 02:48:11.075]  Microwaving your food is one of the worst things you could do because look at all the microwave food that comes in plastic containers.
[02:48:11.696 --> 02:48:16.919]  And any canned food that you have, organic or non-organic... It will have bisphenol A liner.
[02:48:17.119 --> 02:48:21.121]  It has bisphenol A liners in it, and so it's really hard to...
[02:48:22.952 --> 02:48:27.437]  Completely get away from all these chemicals and endocrine disrupting processes.
[02:48:27.617 --> 02:48:39.271]  But if you want to get organic, get away from process, use glass, wash your food well, have shower filters, have filters in your house, just do it.
[02:48:39.331 --> 02:48:41.574]  Get the right kind of filters that actually cut this stuff out.
[02:48:42.074 --> 02:48:43.415]  Not just charcoal filters.
[02:48:43.516 --> 02:48:44.697]  Now is the time, folks.
[02:48:45.137 --> 02:48:47.840]  Because a lot of this is happening because we're a corrupt, dirty society.
[02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:49.622]  But a lot of it is by design.
[02:48:49.662 --> 02:48:50.142]  They admit it.
[02:48:50.643 --> 02:48:53.546]  It's basically you have to keep your body clean.
[02:48:53.586 --> 02:48:55.588]  You have to keep your environment clean.
[02:48:56.048 --> 02:48:57.730]  You have to drink clean water.
[02:48:57.790 --> 02:49:01.333]  I mean, even washing your clothes with most of the detergents out there.
[02:49:01.994 --> 02:49:06.556]  They are going to put endocrine-disrupting and toxic chemicals, and you're going to absorb them through your skin.
[02:49:06.676 --> 02:49:07.737]  Let's expand on that.
[02:49:07.757 --> 02:49:13.060]  I mean, anybody when they were a kid would get clothes at the mall, and you were excited on the first day of school, and you forgot to wash it.
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:17.942]  You'd put the shirt on, and it would, like, get all over you, and then I'd get hives, and I'd have the ink on me.
[02:49:18.262 --> 02:49:22.644]  I mean, that's an exaggerated example of what's coming out of all this into us.
[02:49:23.405 --> 02:49:26.186]  I mean, you look at this water situation in Flint, Michigan.
[02:49:26.206 --> 02:49:26.646]  They're right.
[02:49:26.686 --> 02:49:27.247]  It's toxic.
[02:49:27.287 --> 02:49:31.329]  It is genocide against the 60% black and the 40% white and Hispanic and Asian.
[02:49:32.149 --> 02:49:32.549]  An Arab.
[02:49:32.850 --> 02:49:33.870]  I mean, it's against everybody.
[02:49:33.930 --> 02:49:36.131]  But, you know, Michael Moore says they want to kill the black people.
[02:49:36.391 --> 02:49:42.915]  Folks, that's corrupt government that just doesn't care because of this attitude that so what if there's toxic waste here?
[02:49:43.175 --> 02:49:46.757]  So what if your housing facility is on a landfill and they don't tell you?
[02:49:47.157 --> 02:49:51.519]  You know, so what if reactors, 93% of them, are leaking worldwide?
[02:49:52.119 --> 02:49:53.980]  Used to be big news if a reactor leaked.
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:54.941]  Now it's not even on the news.
[02:49:55.381 --> 02:49:56.582]  The elite themselves
[02:49:58.567 --> 02:49:59.148]  Are crazy!
[02:49:59.628 --> 02:50:02.430]  I mean they just, or they're space aliens that want to live in radiation.
[02:50:02.470 --> 02:50:03.171]  I'm not saying that.
[02:50:03.191 --> 02:50:05.853]  I'm just saying, why do you think they're so crazy and don't care?
[02:50:06.774 --> 02:50:07.975]  They cared 30 years ago more.
[02:50:08.935 --> 02:50:14.420]  I think that because they know that they're going to have to control the population.
[02:50:14.600 --> 02:50:16.041]  They want to see a downfall.
[02:50:16.141 --> 02:50:17.062]  Everything's too late.
[02:50:17.142 --> 02:50:19.564]  The countries are way too far gone in debt.
[02:50:19.584 --> 02:50:20.665]  There has to be a reset.
[02:50:20.685 --> 02:50:23.387]  They're going to ride the collapse and come out on top.
[02:50:23.447 --> 02:50:26.510]  Yeah, they know that they're killing people and they're...
[02:50:27.230 --> 02:50:29.553]  Look, you talk about designer babies.
[02:50:29.693 --> 02:50:31.696]  I mean, are we gonna be in the future?
[02:50:31.776 --> 02:50:32.617]  They're already doing it!
[02:50:32.717 --> 02:50:35.200]  And they're like, well, you know, you can't have it because of this gene.
[02:50:35.501 --> 02:50:40.387]  They're talking about, you know, for their intelligence, how they look, making them 3 to 6 to 12 parents.
[02:50:40.407 --> 02:50:41.148]  They're already doing it.
[02:50:41.889 --> 02:50:43.812]  Chimeras splicing us with animals!
[02:50:45.396 --> 02:50:49.617]  It's already happening, and I have people on the street telling me I'm full of it!
[02:50:49.637 --> 02:50:58.039]  No, that's why it's important to be aware of all these things, avoid all these things, and keep your body clean, and... Absolutely.
[02:50:58.059 --> 02:50:59.180]  Look, look, look, there's no doubt.
[02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:01.680]  There's an evil force directing all this, okay?
[02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:06.681]  You can say it's the devil, you can say it's, you know, enemy forces from Klandafu.
[02:51:07.142 --> 02:51:08.282]  I don't know, but it's bad.

[02:52:09.528 --> 02:52:13.013]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:52:13.774 --> 02:52:14.275]  It's true.
[02:52:14.395 --> 02:52:18.341]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:52:18.542 --> 02:52:20.384]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:52:20.945 --> 02:52:25.412]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[02:54:31.172 --> 02:54:34.375]  Ceiling shot of the InfoWars News Center.
[02:54:34.395 --> 02:54:38.958]  And then you can see the television's reflected there.
[02:54:38.998 --> 02:54:42.021]  It kind of creates that endless mirror hallway effect.
[02:54:42.521 --> 02:54:44.103]  Looks pretty cool.
[02:54:45.744 --> 02:54:46.745]  It's fun to fight tyranny.
[02:54:46.765 --> 02:54:49.627]  Dr. Group's here with us right into the fourth hour.
[02:54:49.687 --> 02:54:51.048]  Anthony Gucciardi's coming in here.
[02:54:51.589 --> 02:54:53.110]  And you guys are going to continue rolling on.
[02:54:53.170 --> 02:54:54.051]  We've got George.
[02:54:55.811 --> 02:55:01.333]  Angelo, Doug, Rick, Steve, I need to go to you guys, and I really appreciate you holding, all of you.
[02:55:01.973 --> 02:55:07.894]  So we are going to go to you pretty much directly when the next hour starts, and Dr. Group is certainly going to like that.
[02:55:08.755 --> 02:55:20.378]  But just finishing up here, what are some of the things that people can do other than avoiding toxins, not, you know, microwaving foods in plastic containers, things like that.
[02:55:21.778 --> 02:55:23.659]  What else can you do to boost fertility?
[02:55:24.790 --> 02:55:31.678]  One of the easiest and most effective and cheapest methods actually is going to be reducing your stress levels.
[02:55:31.818 --> 02:55:41.710]  And that means getting out of scenarios that increase your adrenal output and your stress hormones, which automatically decrease the immune system by 50%.
[02:55:41.870 --> 02:55:43.913]  So don't release as much cortisone.
[02:55:44.133 --> 02:55:48.819]  That's right, but that's why also we have developed certain supplements.
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:56:01.515]  Iodine deficiency is one of the biggest causes of infertility in my mind because all of these things that attack the endocrine system, every organ in the endocrine system is dependent upon iodine.
[02:56:01.855 --> 02:56:12.126]  And if you notice that most endocrine disrupting chemicals are actually brominated, like the fire retardants and everything like that have bromine, fluorine, or chlorine on them.
[02:56:12.306 --> 02:56:15.530]  As a matter of fact, Viagra, believe it or not, has phthalates on it.
[02:56:15.550 --> 02:56:17.893]  So if all the men out there that are taking Viagra
[02:56:18.473 --> 02:56:22.595]  You're actually becoming sterile and possibly infertile by taking Viagra.
[02:56:22.975 --> 02:56:25.256]  Birth control pills have phthalates on them.
[02:56:25.276 --> 02:56:27.917]  Now you also have, what is that, like an NPR article of the study?
[02:56:27.937 --> 02:56:30.538]  Well, yeah, an NPR because this was very interesting.
[02:56:30.558 --> 02:56:32.679]  You know, I've always said, heal the gut.
[02:56:33.099 --> 02:56:35.880]  The gut is one of the most effective things at healing the body.
[02:56:36.260 --> 02:56:47.465]  And so scientists went and looked at indigenous people and said, what's the difference between an American gut flora... And these incredibly fertile women in the Amazon.
[02:56:47.665 --> 02:56:49.667]  Yeah, there is no infertile women in the world.
[02:56:50.328 --> 02:56:51.409]  Look at them, they get pregnant.
[02:56:51.509 --> 02:57:02.360]  And they actually said Americans digestive tracts look like barren deserts compared with the lush tropical rainforest found inside indigenous people.
[02:57:02.740 --> 02:57:05.243]  And that the tribes had 50% more ecological
[02:57:07.905 --> 02:57:10.466]  Diversity with probiotics in the average American.
[02:57:10.646 --> 02:57:16.128]  So diverse probiotics, raw foods, pickled foods is the answer to fertility as well.
[02:57:16.848 --> 02:57:19.509]  And as you mentioned, super male vitality, super female vitality.
[02:57:19.889 --> 02:57:22.590]  X2 is the purest iodine anybody can find from our research.
[02:57:22.890 --> 02:57:24.811]  Those are discounted both today, 15% off.
[02:57:25.151 --> 02:57:26.792]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:57:26.832 --> 02:57:27.672]  So it's a win-win.
[02:57:28.532 --> 02:57:32.474]  Rest, not getting as angry, taking time off if you're trying to get pregnant.
[02:57:34.440 --> 02:57:37.724]  What are some of the other known herbs that have been associated with pregnancy?
[02:57:37.764 --> 02:57:41.127]  I mean, I know there's some that are known as the, you know, basically the pregnancy herbs.
[02:57:41.348 --> 02:57:53.821]  Yeah, Vitex, He Shu Wu, Fo Tai root, that's a traditional Chinese medicine herb, fresh juices, really going back to the basics, cleaning your body, juicing, fasting,
[02:57:54.992 --> 02:58:03.780]  Eliminating all the chemicals and toxins coming in, repairing your endocrine system, clean water is probably one of the most effective things that you can do.
[02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:09.525]  And I always recommend people add a little organic apple cider vinegar in there for minerals and live enzymes.
[02:58:09.586 --> 02:58:18.354]  Kombucha is also something that's very effective at cleansing the body and giving people more live organisms inside their system.
[02:58:18.894 --> 02:58:30.245]  Good probiotics, doing a harmful organism cleanse, and most importantly, cleansing the liver because all these chemicals that we talked about today that disrupt the endocrine system, guess what?
[02:58:30.285 --> 02:58:34.389]  The liver has to process them all, and most people's livers are functioning under 60%.
[02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:42.197]  So once the liver is functioning, the bowel is repaired, your cells are clean, deep cleanse is another thing that's going to help.
[02:58:42.897 --> 02:58:43.578]  Absolutely.

[03:00:23.859 --> 03:00:25.020]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:28.742]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:28.762 --> 03:00:31.703]  Yeah, there's a storm on the loose.
[03:00:32.303 --> 03:00:33.704]  Sirens in my head.
[03:00:34.324 --> 03:00:35.805]  Wrapped up in sirens.
[03:00:36.125 --> 03:00:37.786]  All circuits are dead.
[03:00:38.406 --> 03:00:39.487]  Can I decode?
[03:00:40.167 --> 03:00:42.989]  My whole life spins into a frenzy.
[03:00:49.944 --> 03:00:51.485]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:51.505 --> 03:00:53.346]  It's the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:00:53.446 --> 03:00:58.948]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi and I will be your host with Dr. Edward Group riding shotgun for the rest of the hour.
[03:01:00.169 --> 03:01:11.755]  And there's a study that came out the 13th that no one knows about that I think is probably the biggest and one of the most important studies to come out, I mean really, ever in the history of humanity.
[03:01:12.495 --> 03:01:18.458]  And it's from Harvard University and I can only find just about two news organizations that talked about it.
[03:01:18.558 --> 03:01:30.610]  We're going to talk about it, get into it, get Dr. Group's take on it, and cover a whole host of other news, including the fact that you might be pleased to know North Korea has actually says it's invented a hangover-free alcohol.
[03:01:31.170 --> 03:01:38.838]  So, don't worry, the Pyongyang scientists say they have invented a hangover-free alcohol according to their state-run newspaper.
[03:01:39.398 --> 03:01:53.605]  Says the suave liquor will spare you wincing when you wake, and it has 30-40% alcohol, but it's made from a type of indigenous ginseng that North Koreans use, and due to the blessing of Kim Jong-un, it actually doesn't give you a hangover.
[03:01:54.466 --> 03:01:55.847]  So I'm really excited about that.
[03:01:56.900 --> 03:02:13.109]  But to break right into this study and get Dr. Group's take on it, the article that I found from Medical Daily is called, Pay It Forward, Being Nice is Part of Human Nature, and it's Harvard Research, actually it's Yale University, and it says, A team of researchers from Yale University have some pretty good news for humanity.
[03:02:13.569 --> 03:02:19.212]  Most people are inherently good and kind-hearted, and it's the mean girls and the guys that deviate from the norm.
[03:02:19.593 --> 03:02:25.456]  In fact, according to their study, unkindness is a deliberate attempt to override our natural instinct and pay it forward.
[03:02:25.976 --> 03:02:43.841]  And if you actually read the study and you read the further description in Medical Daily, it goes on to explain that being unkind and being a messed up person, what you might call crazy or rude or whatever, is actually going against your inclination as a human being to be nice to other people.
[03:02:43.901 --> 03:02:49.223]  It's saying your instinct at your core is to be a good person and everything that's outside of that
[03:02:50.163 --> 03:02:52.086]  Is going against your so-called blueprint, right?
[03:02:52.667 --> 03:02:59.398]  But I have a theory, and it goes on to say we don't know why it could be, you know, your youth and stuff like that, but I think it's your health.
[03:03:00.179 --> 03:03:04.506]  And I think I have the studies to back that up as well, Dr. Group, including...
[03:03:05.563 --> 03:03:10.528]  Some like this, the mental health benefits of probiotics, good bacteria may improve mood and fight depression.
[03:03:10.888 --> 03:03:19.837]  Where this study goes on to talk about, we're going to get into it throughout the rest of the show, that the evidence of intake of probiotics can help reduce negative thoughts associated with sad mood.
[03:03:19.937 --> 03:03:28.085]  And if you have a gut biome that's messed up from eating a bunch of junk, like McDonald's which wipes out your gut biome, you can be more aggressive.
[03:03:28.886 --> 03:03:32.607]  And be more negative and just be upset and what people would call rude.
[03:03:33.388 --> 03:03:45.092]  So I put forward the question, what percentage of our actions are we even responsible for and which are just a biological instinct because we are out of line with how we should be biologically?
[03:03:45.112 --> 03:03:45.852]  What do you think about that?
[03:03:47.253 --> 03:03:52.035]  I think everybody is born nice and everybody is born loving.
[03:03:52.315 --> 03:04:06.962]  If you just look at babies and you look at children that are brought up in nature or in loving environments, they don't start to get contaminated until they start listening to the news.
[03:04:07.262 --> 03:04:09.963]  It's all external factors that cause this.
[03:04:10.383 --> 03:04:14.025]  There's no doubt in my mind after studying the effects
[03:04:14.885 --> 03:04:40.885]  On mental disorders, studying every single disease and tracing it back to what is the root cause, that if every single one of us were born, let's say, in the woods, or were not exposed to the negativity on TV, the negative information that we learn in schools, the negative people that are around, the killing, the violence, all that stuff,
[03:04:42.097 --> 03:04:44.778]  Even with that, we still have that good instinct.
[03:04:44.818 --> 03:04:52.921]  We'll still stop to help an old lady or we'll still, hopefully, turn in a wallet when we find it or a lost phone or something like that.
[03:04:53.001 --> 03:04:54.701]  So I feel that we do have that.
[03:04:54.801 --> 03:04:57.902]  We're born with that nice instinct.
[03:04:58.122 --> 03:05:00.123]  And going against it is going against our blueprint.
[03:05:00.283 --> 03:05:05.425]  We'll be right back with the fourth hour of Overdrive with a ton of more news and health information with Dr. Edward Group.
[03:05:09.727 --> 03:05:23.352]  A declassified email sent on April 2, 2011, to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, reveals the invasion of Libya was launched to prevent Muammar Gaddafi from establishing a Pan-African currency based on Libya's gold.
[03:05:23.672 --> 03:05:25.833]  According to the document posted on the U.S.
[03:05:25.873 --> 03:05:27.073]  State Department website,
[03:05:27.273 --> 03:05:37.922]  Advisors to the second son of Gaddafi told sources the Libyan government held 143 tons of gold and a similar amount of silver valued at more than 7 billion dollars.
[03:05:38.083 --> 03:05:44.228]  The gold and silver was to be used to establish an alternative currency to the French franc for African countries.
[03:05:44.568 --> 03:05:51.454]  A large number of Western African countries are former French colonies and many continue to hold French as the official language.
[03:05:51.695 --> 03:05:53.176]  During the invasion of Libya,
[03:05:53.396 --> 03:06:00.005]  Analysts argued Gaddafi planned to stop selling oil in US dollars and demanded instead it be traded in gold.
[03:06:00.205 --> 03:06:05.292]  Prior to the invasion, Gaddafi urged other African and Middle Eastern nations to follow suit.

[03:07:59.790 --> 03:08:00.210]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:34.627 --> 03:08:35.227]  Welcome back.
[03:08:35.247 --> 03:08:38.029]  It's the fourth hour in overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:38.149 --> 03:08:40.631]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi and I'm with Dr. Edward Group.
[03:08:41.131 --> 03:08:49.498]  We're going to cover a lot more news and take your phone calls as well as Alex just came in and he's got a preview of his Farrakhan interview which is really groundbreaking.
[03:08:49.538 --> 03:08:51.199]  I mean, wait until you see this.
[03:08:51.559 --> 03:08:56.343]  At the bottom of the hour we're going to premiere a trailer from the Farrakhan interview.
[03:08:56.843 --> 03:09:02.529]  We're about to go to your calls and we're going to talk to Stephen and a bunch of other ones about some really, really important health issues.
[03:09:03.150 --> 03:09:12.259]  But to bring you up to speed, we're talking about this study that came from Yale University, and I think it's one of the most groundbreaking studies of all time, I mean really of all time, that found
[03:09:13.444 --> 03:09:16.907]  Being nice is part of human nature.
[03:09:17.447 --> 03:09:27.954]  So anything that goes against the actions of kindness and actually being nice to other people is kind of like a mutation in the intellectual spectrum.
[03:09:28.255 --> 03:09:29.536]  It's a going against the blueprint.
[03:09:29.636 --> 03:09:32.178]  And this study found from Yale University that
[03:09:33.294 --> 03:09:37.776]  Most people are inherently good and kind-hearted, and it's the mean girls and guys who deviate from the norm.
[03:09:38.016 --> 03:09:38.837]  That's amazing to me.
[03:09:39.457 --> 03:09:42.058]  And it makes me wonder, right, why are people deviating?
[03:09:42.098 --> 03:09:54.164]  I'm sure there's some genetic factors and everything like that, but it reminds me also about Flint, right, where everyone is talking about the lead that's in the water and the negative effects lead can have, reduced IQ and stuff on children.
[03:09:54.344 --> 03:09:55.384]  Well, here's a good story from Vox.
[03:09:55.604 --> 03:09:57.405]  It says, it's not just Flint.
[03:09:57.605 --> 03:10:01.067]  Every major American city has hazardous amounts of lead hurting kids.
[03:10:01.687 --> 03:10:08.071]  The story of Flint, Michigan's children being poisoned by lead-contaminated drinking water has rightly shocked and scandalized the nation.
[03:10:08.412 --> 03:10:13.875]  But while the situation in Flint is certainly an extreme case, the problem is much more widespread than many realize.
[03:10:14.215 --> 03:10:22.021]  Children in essentially every city in America are being exposed to hazardous levels of toxic lead, and very little is being done about it.
[03:10:23.080 --> 03:10:28.984]  According to the World Health Organization, lead attacks the brain and nervous system, but really no one cares, apparently.
[03:10:29.084 --> 03:10:40.832]  And the lead's biggest impact is on the brain, particularly the developing brains of children and fetuses, resulting in reduced IQ behavioral changes and shortening of attention span, as well as antisocial behavior.
[03:10:42.162 --> 03:10:45.204]  And that is really an issue at every single major U.S.
[03:10:45.244 --> 03:10:45.484]  city.
[03:10:45.504 --> 03:10:48.085]  And I went further, and I looked up the actual studies on it.
[03:10:48.425 --> 03:10:55.970]  And from 2003, there's a study you can find in Science Daily, very low lead levels linked with IQ deficits, according to an EGM study.
[03:10:55.990 --> 03:10:59.932]  It says that lead can be harmful even at very low blood concentrations.
[03:10:59.972 --> 03:11:07.336]  And the five-year study found that children who had blood lead concentrations lower than 10 micrograms suffer intellectual impairment.
[03:11:08.254 --> 03:11:08.474]  Okay?
[03:11:08.894 --> 03:11:11.395]  So, every major city is having this issue.
[03:11:11.595 --> 03:11:15.236]  There's lead in the water in small amounts, not to mention the billion other things.
[03:11:16.236 --> 03:11:21.337]  So, we look at this study where it says people are meant to be nice, they're meant to be kind, you know, they're meant to do all these things.
[03:11:21.377 --> 03:11:22.257]  Where do we go wrong?
[03:11:22.837 --> 03:11:25.738]  I think it's when our body is blasted with all of this stuff.
[03:11:26.058 --> 03:11:34.720]  Not just the lead, which is apparently reducing IQ and causing kids to be less social and not really understand what's going on, but not just everything.
[03:11:34.740 --> 03:11:36.061]  I mean, just every single thing.
[03:11:36.101 --> 03:11:37.601]  Is it not the wildest thing, Dr. Group?
[03:11:38.732 --> 03:11:41.414]  Well, it's what I've been saying for a long time.
[03:11:41.474 --> 03:11:49.799]  It's a toxic soup that we're exposed to and it starts from conception and all the way through pregnancy, what the mother does.
[03:11:50.960 --> 03:11:57.564]  There is no such thing as the 700 and something diseases that are listed out there, degenerative diseases.
[03:11:58.084 --> 03:12:05.429]  There's no such thing as mental illness and the 500 different mental illnesses that are listed in the
[03:12:06.449 --> 03:12:08.711]  Uh, the DSM, DSM-5.
[03:12:09.412 --> 03:12:14.677]  All of these conditions out here are all caused by an underlying issue.
[03:12:15.257 --> 03:12:20.622]  It's chemical toxicity that's coming into the body and going up to the brain.
[03:12:21.063 --> 03:12:23.325]  We put mercury in people's mouths!
[03:12:23.525 --> 03:12:24.105]  I mean, how...
[03:12:25.446 --> 03:12:42.916]  That is like, I can't even comprehend that, that Dennis, still for all these years, the American Dental Association, the agencies that are there to protect us, the FDA, the USDA, the EPA, you know, all of these lettered governmental agencies that are supposed to
[03:12:44.142 --> 03:12:53.586]  Be on the lookout and be the guardians for us are letting all these chemicals be released into the atmosphere.
[03:12:54.026 --> 03:13:00.069]  We have highly toxic levels of aluminum being poured down on us, aluminum nanoparticles from the chemtrails.
[03:13:00.809 --> 03:13:29.651]  Every single one of the chemicals we talk about, and you talk about Anthony, whether it's lead, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, phthalates, BPA, it doesn't matter what chemical it is, you can trace back psychological issues, you can trace back to weight gain, you can trace it to disease, you can trace it to skin disorders, and then on top of that, you have all the vaccinations, and you have the flu shots every single year, which are destroying the immune system, you have the negativity on TV,
[03:13:30.752 --> 03:13:33.573]  You have negative environments taught in school.
[03:13:33.913 --> 03:13:37.454]  You have the wrong education taught in school with the Common Core.
[03:13:39.514 --> 03:13:41.235]  You know, we need to go back to basics.
[03:13:41.495 --> 03:13:52.638]  I mean, we need to go back to love and we need to go back to, you know, clean food and clean water and clean air and all of those things, I believe, I've seen it happen.
[03:13:52.758 --> 03:13:59.420]  I mean, I have literally seen it happen with thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people that have taken the effort to clean up
[03:13:59.980 --> 03:14:00.620]  Their environment.
[03:14:00.820 --> 03:14:18.510]  Their kids no longer had ADD, ADHD, which are caused by artificial sweeteners and artificial colors in their food and all the vaccinations and flu shots and all the chemicals and the high fructose corn syrup they're consuming every single day, which is destroying their brain.
[03:14:19.651 --> 03:14:25.354]  Alcohol in adults causes anger and mental disorders.
[03:14:25.634 --> 03:14:27.175]  I mean, the list goes on and on and on.
[03:14:28.126 --> 03:14:31.330]  It's a good thing, though, for big organizations.
[03:14:31.350 --> 03:14:37.377]  You know, we're going to talk also about the fatal drug overdoses hit record high in the United States with pharmaceutical drug overdoses.
[03:14:37.858 --> 03:14:41.221]  More than cocaine, heroin, car accidents, you name it.
[03:14:41.662 --> 03:14:43.484]  But first, let's go to callers.
[03:14:43.544 --> 03:14:45.046]  Let's talk to Steven in Texas.
[03:14:45.066 --> 03:14:45.927]  You've been holding for a while.
[03:14:45.967 --> 03:14:47.409]  You have a question for Dr. Group.
[03:14:47.469 --> 03:14:48.250]  What is on your mind?
[03:14:49.884 --> 03:14:54.667]  Yeah, I just had a quick question back to the group about the super male vitality that I've been taking.
[03:14:55.668 --> 03:14:57.969]  My wife also takes the super female vitality.
[03:14:57.989 --> 03:14:58.470]  She loves it.
[03:14:59.470 --> 03:15:01.772]  I've noticed a lot more energy in her for sure.
[03:15:02.773 --> 03:15:11.919]  As for my end, I've noticed a little bit, a little bit more energy, but I've also noticed that I get a lot more tired towards the end of the day when before it wasn't such an issue.
[03:15:12.619 --> 03:15:19.644]  But I have noticed that and I didn't know if that was something, if you've seen that with other people or if it's something maybe I need to be doing to offset that.
[03:15:20.904 --> 03:15:28.727]  Well, anytime you're taking an herbal extract, it's not designed to replace the hormones inside your body.
[03:15:28.767 --> 03:15:34.850]  In other words, it doesn't contain testosterone and DHEA and growth hormone.
[03:15:35.450 --> 03:15:40.612]  What it's designed to do is to help balance your hormones naturally, and so you might get
[03:15:41.272 --> 03:15:48.314]  ...an excretion of those hormones for a period of time into your bloodstream and then those might be processed and eliminated.
[03:15:48.635 --> 03:15:51.235]  But there could be many other factors that are causing that.
[03:15:51.295 --> 03:15:57.958]  I mean, you know, I would really have to evaluate what you do on a daily basis if you are taking the X2.
[03:15:58.058 --> 03:15:58.738]  How old are you?
[03:16:00.034 --> 03:16:07.756]  I'm 32, and I have X2, but that was another reason I wanted to ask you, is it okay to take those together at the same time?
[03:16:08.096 --> 03:16:09.617]  A lot, yes it is.
[03:16:09.697 --> 03:16:10.217]  Yes it is.
[03:16:10.277 --> 03:16:15.779]  I mean, the fact of the matter is, pretty much every single person on the planet should be on iodine.
[03:16:15.879 --> 03:16:20.800]  It's just amazing what it does, how it helps heal the endocrine system.
[03:16:21.380 --> 03:16:22.761]  You have practically
[03:16:24.637 --> 03:16:40.610]  I would say 8 out of 10 people over the age of 40 with thyroid conditions, either hypothyroid, hyperthyroid, or Hashimoto's, you have, it's not that 9 out of 10 people have endocrine disorders or hormone imbalances.
[03:16:40.630 --> 03:16:43.392]  100% of the people have hormone imbalances.
[03:16:43.432 --> 03:16:45.053]  There's no way to avoid it.
[03:16:45.113 --> 03:16:48.756]  I know that sounds like a bold statement, but when you look at
[03:16:49.537 --> 03:17:04.784]  The food supply and you look at all the contaminants that we're exposed to on a regular basis and the fact that nobody except for InfoWars listeners really has the solutions to cleaning their body and they understand the root cause of all these things.
[03:17:05.084 --> 03:17:08.646]  We have a very, very small amount of people that actually know the truth.
[03:17:08.706 --> 03:17:10.967]  So yes, I would highly recommend
[03:17:11.827 --> 03:17:22.031]  Everybody be on the X2 for the iodine and also just look around and see what you're doing, what you're eating, if you're eating an organic diet, how much exercise you're getting.
[03:17:22.432 --> 03:17:27.874]  And I can tell you one more big thing that could cause that fatigue in the afternoons is stress.
[03:17:27.934 --> 03:17:37.938]  I don't know how much stress you're under on a daily basis, but you might want to incorporate some more meditation or just some things that you do for fun into your life to try to calm yourself down.
[03:17:37.998 --> 03:17:39.578]  You know, I think it's an interesting example.
[03:17:39.618 --> 03:17:47.601]  People always seem to think that hormonal imbalance is some weird thing that only, like, you know, a really small percentage of the population has.
[03:17:47.981 --> 03:17:53.562]  I would equate hormonal balance to finding the perfect temperature in a room.
[03:17:53.582 --> 03:17:55.363]  Like, finding the perfect temperature.
[03:17:55.403 --> 03:17:56.543]  It's almost impossible, right?
[03:17:56.583 --> 03:17:59.324]  Like, you're in your car and you're turning the heat up or the heat down.
[03:17:59.344 --> 03:18:00.344]  It's too hot, it's too cold.
[03:18:00.364 --> 03:18:01.745]  You're opening the windows, closing the windows.
[03:18:02.005 --> 03:18:06.746]  You know how hard it is to achieve temperature homeostasis, where it's like, wow, that feels perfect, right?
[03:18:07.026 --> 03:18:09.668]  That's about how hard it is to achieve hormonal balance.
[03:18:10.068 --> 03:18:16.073]  And we don't realize how much it's triggering us on a daily basis when we're upset or when we're tired or whatever it is.
[03:18:16.213 --> 03:18:19.775]  It's the biological factors that we're not aware of just triggering us.
[03:18:19.795 --> 03:18:21.677]  It's like, it's like a little kid poking you.
[03:18:21.697 --> 03:18:24.259]  Like, I'm not touching you and, you know, putting your hand in his face.
[03:18:24.279 --> 03:18:24.879]  I'm not touching you.
[03:18:25.099 --> 03:18:26.680]  You just get upset and you don't understand why.
[03:18:26.700 --> 03:18:28.462]  Or you feel tired, you feel like crap.
[03:18:28.502 --> 03:18:33.145]  It's because your body is sending signals constantly throughout the day and you're not listening.
[03:18:33.285 --> 03:18:36.268]  And also I would say, as always, we're not giving medical advice.
[03:18:36.589 --> 03:18:40.032]  Talk to a health care provider before starting anything, taking any supplements, doing anything.
[03:18:40.373 --> 03:18:51.065]  Talk to your health care provider, a qualified health care provider, and ask him as well, she or he, and always take this as not medical advice.
[03:18:51.525 --> 03:18:52.886]  Anyway, thank you for your call, Stephen.
[03:18:52.906 --> 03:18:56.387]  I was just going to say, I have hormone imbalance.
[03:18:56.427 --> 03:18:59.549]  It's impossible for everybody to be completely balanced all the time.
[03:18:59.589 --> 03:19:08.292]  I mean, that would mean that your pineal gland, your pituitary gland, your adrenal glands, your gut, everything would be in perfect 100%.
[03:19:08.332 --> 03:19:11.754]  Your ovaries if you're a female, your testicles if you're a male.
[03:19:14.835 --> 03:19:21.321]  That means everything would be working perfect all the time and your hormones would be balanced and that's just not the way it is living in this world.
[03:19:21.341 --> 03:19:27.586]  You just try to do the best you can, keep yourself as clean as you can, keep yourself relaxed and unstressed as you possibly can.
[03:19:27.606 --> 03:19:34.672]  And that's going back to basics, drinking clean water and eating good organic foods and you do the best that you can living in this environment.
[03:19:34.932 --> 03:19:36.353]  Yeah, I mean, you're never going to be balanced.
[03:19:36.413 --> 03:19:42.835]  Even just sitting here in this chair, I'm inhaling toxic substances, you know, and just drinking regular good bottled water in a glass bottle.
[03:19:42.855 --> 03:19:45.016]  You're still getting, you know, some form of contamination.
[03:19:45.496 --> 03:19:57.141]  Anyway, we're going to come back and finish up with the calls for Dr. Group, health questions, and then at the bottom of the hour, we've got a trailer for the epic Louis Farrakhan interview with Alex Jones.
[03:19:57.161 --> 03:19:57.761]  We'll be right back.
[03:19:57.801 --> 03:19:59.482]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:59.522 --> 03:20:00.262]  I'm Anthony Gutierrez.
[03:20:10.290 --> 03:20:13.476]  Winter has just begun, and are you already tired of being cold?

[03:24:26.049 --> 03:24:28.476]  The country was wrong.
[03:24:34.158 --> 03:24:34.898]  Welcome back.
[03:24:35.078 --> 03:24:53.293]  You know, if the cameras were on during the break, I think me and Dr. Group would look like total crazy people, fiending, picking up all the Infowars Life products and taking them, taking the Living Defense and Supermail Vitality, the new one, which is super, super strong, and just gobbling down the products.
[03:24:53.333 --> 03:24:55.915]  You know, I'll continue to do it now with the new Supermail Vitality.
[03:24:56.695 --> 03:24:58.337]  And the reason we do this,
[03:24:59.534 --> 03:25:06.829]  Is not just because we are crazy people that take tons of supplements, but because we really believe in them and they really work and we use them every single day.
[03:25:07.230 --> 03:25:09.535]  That's why we can sit here and talk about them.
[03:25:10.376 --> 03:25:18.505]  With true confidence and true charisma, because we actually care about getting them to you, and it actually is really part of my mission.
[03:25:19.486 --> 03:25:32.639]  So, I'm telling you, when I say InfoWarsLife.com, get 15% off Supermail Vitality and Survival Shield X2, it's time to stock up, because this new Supermail Vitality run, I mean, you will taste the difference.
[03:25:33.280 --> 03:25:41.711]  He won't even need me to tell you, when you get the new Supermail Vitality and you try this one, the fresh herbs are extremely potent on this run.
[03:25:42.131 --> 03:25:46.417]  In fact, when he brought it up to me earlier, I said, well let me try the old one versus the new one.
[03:25:46.457 --> 03:25:47.198]  I actually have it here.
[03:25:47.218 --> 03:25:48.159]  If you look...
[03:25:49.224 --> 03:26:00.430]  For my testing purposes, if we can zoom in or something, I put old on this one and new on this one, and I compared them over and over again, and was like, wow, this is really strong.
[03:26:01.131 --> 03:26:02.451]  And you will notice the difference.
[03:26:02.671 --> 03:26:04.933]  It already works, the so-called old one already works.
[03:26:04.993 --> 03:26:07.114]  It's great, obviously, but this is a whole new round.
[03:26:07.134 --> 03:26:12.937]  So I really suggest you go to InfoWarsLife.com and stock up on Supermail Vitality and Survival Shield X2, 15% off.

[03:26:34.983 --> 03:26:38.347]  They want to make a sperm bot robot suit for your sperm.
[03:26:38.888 --> 03:26:46.016]  So what's happening is a team in Germany has developed tiny robot suits that can help sperm become more mobile, solving one of the biggest causes of infertility in men.
[03:26:46.377 --> 03:26:52.865]  If the researchers can successfully replicate their lab results inside the human body, it could be a new option for couples struggling to conceive.
[03:26:53.145 --> 03:26:53.846]  And by the way...
[03:26:54.810 --> 03:26:59.116]  People that are really, really struggling and stuff, I understand the promise of this, but it's also ridiculous.
[03:26:59.437 --> 03:27:07.368]  These sperm bots are miniature metal helixes that are just large enough to completely wrap around the tail of a single sperm and help it along the way towards the egg.
[03:27:08.618 --> 03:27:14.463]  So, I get that there's a percentage of the population that could really use this and, you know, it's a good medical innovation.
[03:27:14.523 --> 03:27:15.824]  I love technological innovations.
[03:27:16.064 --> 03:27:25.032]  But at the same time, come on, we should probably talk about ways to increase your sperm health instead of creating AI sperm bot suits to deliver it to the egg.
[03:27:25.052 --> 03:27:25.833]  What do you think, Dr. Group?
[03:27:25.973 --> 03:27:27.734]  Bionic sperm is what it is.
[03:27:28.194 --> 03:27:33.217]  Again, you know, it's not addressing the root cause of what the problem is.
[03:27:33.237 --> 03:27:48.625]  I mean, look at all the money that's being spent to develop a bionic suit for sperm, when that money should go to educating people on, avoid these 10 things and clean your body and you'll get pregnant the natural way.
[03:27:49.305 --> 03:27:52.327]  So, even if you do have a sperm bot,
[03:27:53.237 --> 03:27:59.842]  You know, metal thing that goes around your sperm and then they reverse the process and apparently it gets sucked right back out.
[03:28:01.544 --> 03:28:02.344]  What's to say?
[03:28:02.404 --> 03:28:04.926]  I mean, your baby that you're going to have is still toxic.
[03:28:05.026 --> 03:28:06.487]  That mother is still toxic.
[03:28:06.668 --> 03:28:18.357]  I mean, all those chemicals and everything are still there just because the sperm, you know, one of the problems that we have in men is low sperm count, low sperm motility, and that's why they're doing this because
[03:28:18.837 --> 03:28:26.303]  Right, and I'm not an expert, but I have talked to one of the most foremost experts on, I guess you would call it, this area of research into sperm.
[03:28:26.343 --> 03:28:29.626]  And he was talking about it's not just the sperm count, it's the quality of the sperm.
[03:28:29.926 --> 03:28:34.710]  Because even if you have a high sperm count, the quality of your sperm could be really low if you're very unhealthy.
[03:28:34.990 --> 03:28:39.814]  So what can happen is that low quality sperm creates a child, and you know, you're really kind of
[03:28:40.515 --> 03:28:49.423]  In my view, doing something not that good, if you're going to be eating like crap, treating your body like crap, and bringing a child into this world, that is probably going to be pretty unhealthy as well.
[03:28:49.724 --> 03:28:51.966]  So you really have to think about, too, it's not just the count, right?
[03:28:52.046 --> 03:28:52.766]  It's about the quality.
[03:28:52.786 --> 03:28:53.267]  No, exactly.
[03:28:53.307 --> 03:28:53.968]  It's the quality.
[03:28:54.008 --> 03:28:56.009]  I mean, that's what's going to transfer
[03:28:56.810 --> 03:29:04.333]  All the memories, like we talked about earlier, and all the genes, and the DNA, and all of the codes, and the genomes.
[03:29:04.353 --> 03:29:06.494]  And they used to treat it like a ritual, like Alex was saying.
[03:29:06.634 --> 03:29:13.577]  It used to be a big deal, you know, cleanse your body, you know, be really, really healthy for months, or weeks, or whatever, and just do super amounts of cleansing.
[03:29:13.617 --> 03:29:17.538]  Now it's just like, yeah, we're gonna have a kid, crack open the Coca-Cola, let's get down to business.
[03:29:17.578 --> 03:29:18.379]  Now it's like...
[03:29:19.399 --> 03:29:25.685]  Uh, let's go down to the local IVF place, let's try one month, and if we don't have a kid, let's go get in vitro.
[03:29:26.005 --> 03:29:29.048]  Yeah, that's actually, that's more like the case.
[03:29:29.148 --> 03:29:36.514]  It's just really sad what we've come to with that, and now what Alex was talking about earlier with his designer babies, what's it going to be in 10 years?
[03:29:36.554 --> 03:29:39.357]  You go down and you say, yeah, I want to buy a baby.
[03:29:39.777 --> 03:29:41.399]  And, uh, you know, how much is this baby?
[03:29:41.439 --> 03:29:43.340]  Well, they have GMO babies already, too.
[03:29:43.681 --> 03:29:44.862]  GMO babies are a thing, too.
[03:29:44.982 --> 03:29:48.385]  So if you can't have a kid, you should likely modify one of your own, I guess.
[03:29:48.665 --> 03:29:49.286]  We'll be back.
[03:29:49.346 --> 03:29:53.990]  We're going to premiere a trailer for Alex's epic Louis Farrakhan interview.
[03:29:54.050 --> 03:29:54.971]  You don't want to miss this.
[03:29:55.031 --> 03:29:56.913]  And then we'll be taking your calls later in the show.
[03:29:56.933 --> 03:29:57.593]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:59.155 --> 03:30:00.056]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.556 --> 03:30:02.157]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.078 --> 03:30:05.761]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:11.647 --> 03:30:19.452]  Serving as a microcosm of the Obama administration, a real estate developer partially demolished the reputed birthplace of the Bill of Rights.
[03:30:19.733 --> 03:30:29.840]  The developer, Triple Crown Corp., secured a permit to demolish a two-story stone building, formerly known as James Bell Tavern, in Silver Springs Township, Pennsylvania.
[03:30:30.040 --> 03:30:38.926]  By the time a third of the building was destroyed, the city stopped the demolition because officials realized the Bill of Rights was conceived at the tavern during a 1788 meeting.
[03:30:40.527 --> 03:30:48.669]  How appropriate that part of the building has been torn down while other parts remain, commenter WC Handy wrote to the local Sentinel newspaper.
[03:30:49.049 --> 03:30:52.430]  We have a Congress that is so intent on destroying the Bill of Rights.
[03:30:52.690 --> 03:30:57.572]  The building as it stands now is rather indicative of the current state of our Bill of Rights.
[03:30:57.872 --> 03:31:02.233]  Why not leave the building as it is to serve as a reminder to us all, he added.
[03:31:02.473 --> 03:31:06.074]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[03:31:09.502 --> 03:31:13.806]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male, and then when super female came out, tell us what happened.
[03:31:14.146 --> 03:31:18.750]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[03:31:18.910 --> 03:31:19.931]  Talk about the effects.
[03:31:20.252 --> 03:31:21.733]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[03:31:21.753 --> 03:31:23.354]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[03:31:23.675 --> 03:31:24.736]  I feel like I look better.
[03:31:24.796 --> 03:31:25.436]  I feel better.
[03:31:25.496 --> 03:31:26.577]  I feel sexier.
[03:31:26.918 --> 03:31:27.278]  I love it.
[03:31:27.518 --> 03:31:30.419]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[03:31:30.499 --> 03:31:33.220]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[03:31:33.441 --> 03:31:34.461]  Check it out for yourself.
[03:31:34.501 --> 03:31:35.541]  Consult your physician.

[03:31:38.063 --> 03:31:39.023]  This is life-changing.
[03:31:39.383 --> 03:31:40.163]  Shower filters.
[03:31:40.304 --> 03:31:41.924]  We're introducing the best yet.
[03:31:42.024 --> 03:31:45.966]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower filter.

[03:32:08.801 --> 03:32:09.702]  I want more candy!
[03:32:09.722 --> 03:32:11.003]  I want more baby again!
[03:32:11.063 --> 03:32:11.884]  Why, why, why?
[03:32:12.364 --> 03:32:21.771]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[03:32:22.111 --> 03:32:24.713]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[03:32:24.813 --> 03:32:28.176]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[03:32:28.356 --> 03:32:34.380]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[03:32:34.700 --> 03:32:39.524]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[03:32:39.824 --> 03:32:45.989]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[03:32:46.189 --> 03:32:53.674]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[03:32:53.934 --> 03:33:01.219]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[03:33:01.480 --> 03:33:04.922]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:33:05.082 --> 03:33:08.024]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:33:19.204 --> 03:33:25.748]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:28.810 --> 03:33:31.112]  This is the big picture.
[03:33:31.712 --> 03:33:33.734]  An official television report to the nation.
[03:33:35.115 --> 03:33:36.696]  I dare you, but I know you.
[03:33:41.801 --> 03:33:48.184]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons.
[03:33:48.705 --> 03:33:53.647]  Your power as media is gradually being destroyed.
[03:33:53.867 --> 03:33:59.530]  Mainstream media, they're gonna take just what you said and just show the clip again out of context.
[03:33:59.770 --> 03:34:06.474]  Here, recruits with specialized backgrounds were taught the nature, methods, and techniques of propaganda and its dissemination.
[03:34:06.794 --> 03:34:13.158]  Stop lying and start telling the truth to the American people and to the world.
[03:34:13.278 --> 03:34:16.640]  Perhaps its most rewarding form of expression is news.
[03:34:17.220 --> 03:34:19.121]  Our news is ready-made propaganda.
[03:34:19.621 --> 03:34:22.102]  Mainstream media is losing credibility, losing ratings.
[03:34:22.162 --> 03:34:25.783]  Even USA Today a few weeks ago admitted television for politics is dead.
[03:34:25.803 --> 03:34:27.764]  It faces its mortality.
[03:34:27.884 --> 03:34:43.230]  When you put Mr. Trump on television every minute of every day, questioning, hoping he would say something that would blow him out of the water, and every day he got stronger and stronger, that shows that your media is not working.
[03:34:43.430 --> 03:34:44.911]  So why not work it for good?
[03:34:45.271 --> 03:34:50.953]  I know full well the media will take it out of context and say that Alex Jones endorses everything that Minister Liz Faircon has to say.
[03:34:50.973 --> 03:34:53.473]  You know, even if it was 30, 40 years ago, we all grow.
[03:34:53.674 --> 03:34:54.354]  Warn them.
[03:34:54.874 --> 03:34:56.334]  Tell them, I dare you.
[03:34:56.814 --> 03:34:59.315]  Well, I dare you to be good.
[03:34:59.835 --> 03:35:03.937]  And I know you can't be good unless a gun is put to your head.
[03:35:05.177 --> 03:35:07.618]  But gun is at your head right now.
[03:35:08.078 --> 03:35:09.358]  So go on and be good.
[03:35:09.438 --> 03:35:11.259]  It's better for you if you did.
[03:35:18.974 --> 03:35:20.815]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[03:35:21.076 --> 03:35:22.777]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[03:35:22.877 --> 03:35:25.599]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[03:35:25.799 --> 03:35:26.539]  Alex Jones.
[03:35:26.639 --> 03:35:27.640]  His name is Alex Jones.
[03:35:27.700 --> 03:35:30.562]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[03:35:30.822 --> 03:35:34.024]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[03:35:34.104 --> 03:35:36.046]  Alex Jones, the nut job radio guy.
[03:35:36.066 --> 03:35:37.607]  Talk show host Alex Jones.
[03:35:37.667 --> 03:35:42.970]  A man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories, you have to wonder if he really believes half of what he says.
[03:35:42.990 --> 03:35:45.372]  I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up!
[03:35:45.672 --> 03:35:46.533]  This isn't a game!
[03:35:46.613 --> 03:35:47.354]  Hate speech.
[03:35:47.574 --> 03:35:49.555]  Can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[03:35:49.575 --> 03:35:53.959]  I think Alex was the one who took the pro-gun position.
[03:35:54.160 --> 03:35:55.941]  1776 will commence again if you try to...
[03:35:58.072 --> 03:35:59.874]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[03:36:00.054 --> 03:36:01.615]  Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[03:36:01.795 --> 03:36:04.958]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
[03:36:05.078 --> 03:36:07.600]  It's an internet talk show called InfoWars.
[03:36:07.760 --> 03:36:10.722]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[03:36:10.962 --> 03:36:13.224]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[03:36:13.244 --> 03:36:15.966]  They're making some very serious allegations against the U.S.
[03:36:16.006 --> 03:36:20.770]  government, saying that they stage attacks, they allow them to occur in the United States against U.S.
[03:36:20.790 --> 03:36:21.691]  citizens.
[03:36:21.811 --> 03:36:23.312]  Alex Jones may sound crazy.
[03:36:23.552 --> 03:36:25.994]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[03:36:26.034 --> 03:36:27.175]  That man's a threat to this country.
[03:36:27.455 --> 03:36:28.816]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[03:36:28.836 --> 03:36:30.136]  Deeply, I think, racist.
[03:36:30.216 --> 03:36:32.077]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[03:36:32.097 --> 03:36:33.718]  He's considered legit among the crazies.
[03:36:33.938 --> 03:36:39.900]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him.
[03:36:40.120 --> 03:36:40.840]  I'd love to see that.
[03:36:41.761 --> 03:36:42.241]  In uniform.
[03:36:43.621 --> 03:36:46.923]  Keep shoving lies at your audience, jackasses.
[03:36:48.001 --> 03:36:55.015]  That was a powerful trailer, especially when it shows all of the mainstream media taxes just converging one after another.
[03:36:55.536 --> 03:36:57.239]  You're not allowed to question anything.
[03:36:57.941 --> 03:36:58.762]  Go back to sleep.
[03:36:59.163 --> 03:36:59.664]  You're bad.
[03:37:00.606 --> 03:37:02.607]  We're going to go to some more calls here with Dr. Group.
[03:37:02.688 --> 03:37:03.608]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:37:03.648 --> 03:37:06.230]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:37:06.931 --> 03:37:13.115]  We're going to go and take some more questions for Dr. Group, including we've got Scott in Michigan.
[03:37:13.175 --> 03:37:17.899]  He wants to talk about some thyroid issues, and I've actually got a study that came out today.
[03:37:18.559 --> 03:37:19.480]  About thyroid health.
[03:37:19.560 --> 03:37:21.561]  It ties into fertility too.
[03:37:21.941 --> 03:37:27.084]  Thyroid disease can have significant effects on fertility and pregnancy, suggests a new review.
[03:37:27.624 --> 03:37:37.330]  Research has found that thyroid disease can have significant implications on fertility and pregnancy, and women presenting reproductive health issues should be screened for thyroid problems.
[03:37:38.010 --> 03:37:45.415]  Maybe their boyfriend or husband or whatever shouldn't have their sperm bodic suit on and instead should check their thyroid health.
[03:37:45.435 --> 03:37:48.076]  So anyway, Scott in Michigan, you want to talk about this issue.
[03:37:48.536 --> 03:37:49.297]  How's it going, Scott?
[03:37:50.378 --> 03:37:50.618]  Great.
[03:37:50.858 --> 03:37:51.798]  Thanks for having me on, guys.
[03:37:52.799 --> 03:37:53.900]  Quick question for Dr. Group.
[03:37:53.920 --> 03:38:02.465]  A couple years back, my wife had her thyroid irradiated and just wondering, are there benefits for her to be taking Survival Shield?
[03:38:04.213 --> 03:38:04.913]  Absolutely.
[03:38:04.933 --> 03:38:26.032]  I mean, the standard, one of the, I don't know what exactly happened with the thyroid, with your wife's thyroid, but I tell you what, we have an epidemic right now of thyroid cancer, thyroid diseases, and the thyroid is essential for producing thyroid hormones and regulating your metabolism, regulating your hormones in your body.
[03:38:26.112 --> 03:38:26.272]  So,
[03:38:27.153 --> 03:38:38.818]  What happens with one of the beliefs tracing back to thyroid cancer and different types of diseases of the thyroid leads right back to iodine because you look at what damages the thyroid the most.
[03:38:39.639 --> 03:38:44.701]  What damages the thyroid the most are the halogens because the thyroid doesn't know.
[03:38:44.721 --> 03:38:54.846]  The thyroid has iodine receptor sites and bromine and chlorine and fluorine or fluoride, which are the other halogens besides iodine,
[03:38:55.566 --> 03:38:57.667]  The thyroid thinks that those are iodine.
[03:38:57.748 --> 03:39:02.851]  And so basically the thyroid takes and sucks in the fluoride, the chlorine, the bromine.
[03:39:03.591 --> 03:39:07.514]  Not only that, but then you have some xenoestrogens we talked about too, the phthalates.
[03:39:08.214 --> 03:39:11.837]  So what happens, the thyroid becomes bombarded with all these chemicals.
[03:39:11.997 --> 03:39:13.238]  And what does iodine do?
[03:39:13.478 --> 03:39:25.366]  When you start taking iodine, it actually starts immobilizing these chemicals and the thyroid starts to slowly, it helps the body slowly regenerate the thyroid over a period of time.
[03:39:25.909 --> 03:39:28.104]  Now, in most cases...
[03:39:29.372 --> 03:39:32.714]  That I've seen it can take up to a year to normalize.
[03:39:32.954 --> 03:39:33.914]  Everybody's different.
[03:39:34.034 --> 03:39:35.915]  Everybody has different dietary habits.
[03:39:36.355 --> 03:39:42.798]  I wish I could say, you know, do this and it's going to be work for every single person and it's going to take this amount of time for every single person.
[03:39:43.178 --> 03:39:45.199]  But we all know we live in different environments.
[03:39:45.519 --> 03:39:46.840]  We do live in different homes.
[03:39:47.120 --> 03:39:48.501]  We all eat different foods.
[03:39:48.541 --> 03:39:50.261]  We all drink different substances.
[03:39:51.062 --> 03:39:54.843]  Your toxic load might be different than John Doe's toxic load.
[03:39:56.158 --> 03:40:03.160]  But the bottom line is, Dr. Brownstein has done many videos also on the effects of iodine on the thyroid.
[03:40:03.180 --> 03:40:05.240]  I highly suggest you go to YouTube.
[03:40:05.380 --> 03:40:07.921]  I did a webinar on iodine.
[03:40:08.421 --> 03:40:11.102]  Highly suggest iodine for everybody.
[03:40:11.522 --> 03:40:19.524]  And without making, you know, without evaluating and being your wife's treating doctor, I would say that if it were me,
[03:40:20.504 --> 03:40:21.485]  There's no doubt about it.
[03:40:21.525 --> 03:40:24.447]  I would be taking it on a daily basis or at least every other day.
[03:40:24.667 --> 03:40:27.510]  And always check with your health care provider before taking any products.
[03:40:27.810 --> 03:40:33.795]  But it's like, you know, there's so much commotion about the natural health industry and the nutraceutical industry.
[03:40:33.835 --> 03:40:36.077]  Like, well, do I really need to be taking this?
[03:40:36.137 --> 03:40:36.537]  I don't know.
[03:40:36.577 --> 03:40:39.780]  I'm a little skeptical about this whole nascent iodide thing.
[03:40:40.140 --> 03:40:44.282]  And then it's like, fatal drug overdoses hit record high in the U.S., government figures show.
[03:40:44.623 --> 03:40:47.164]  Deaths from drug overdoses have surged across the U.S.
[03:40:47.184 --> 03:40:49.626]  to record levels, according to the CDC.
[03:40:50.066 --> 03:40:58.411]  The overdose deaths last year exceeded 47,000, more than the number of people killed in car accidents and up 7% from the previous year.
[03:40:59.651 --> 03:41:03.814]  61% of the deaths involved some type of opioid pain relievers and heroin.
[03:41:04.294 --> 03:41:09.597]  The count also included deaths from powerful sedatives, cocaine, and other legal and illicit drugs.
[03:41:10.037 --> 03:41:11.317]  So people are taking painkillers.
[03:41:11.357 --> 03:41:15.199]  I think it's 12 million in the United States are taking painkillers recreationally for fun.
[03:41:15.700 --> 03:41:17.141]  People are dying from painkillers.
[03:41:17.441 --> 03:41:19.302]  They're destroying their bodies from painkillers.
[03:41:19.322 --> 03:41:20.922]  I mean, I hate painkillers.
[03:41:21.383 --> 03:41:25.165]  I really don't know how anyone gets addicted because they make... a few times I've been forced to take them.
[03:41:25.805 --> 03:41:27.349]  They make me feel terrible.
[03:41:27.830 --> 03:41:33.444]  And people get addicted to these pharmaceutical drugs, they take too much, they have poor interactions, they die, their heart blows up.
[03:41:34.352 --> 03:41:42.238]  And no one seems to be causing a big commotion, but then you have nutraceuticals and say, oh, I don't know if I, you know, and by the way, I'm not trashing you, Scott.
[03:41:42.258 --> 03:41:42.798]  You've been great.
[03:41:42.858 --> 03:41:43.539]  I'm not talking about you.
[03:41:43.579 --> 03:41:47.702]  I'm just talking about people in general that are so afraid about nutraceuticals.
[03:41:48.002 --> 03:41:48.362]  Try them.
[03:41:48.863 --> 03:41:52.345]  I understand why it's, you know, your body, your body is a precious, sacred thing.
[03:41:52.365 --> 03:41:54.687]  We don't want to just be shoveling things into our mouths.
[03:41:55.007 --> 03:41:56.688]  But at the same time, it seems like the U.S.
[03:41:56.708 --> 03:41:59.651]  has an identity crisis because they love
[03:42:00.332 --> 03:42:04.422]  Most people, it seems, in the United States, based on the statistics, just want to take pharmaceutical drugs.
[03:42:04.482 --> 03:42:09.334]  The doctor says, take this antibiotic for your virus, which is useless, and they'll do it.
[03:42:10.069 --> 03:42:13.650]  But God forbid we try to give you guys some natural products, right?
[03:42:13.910 --> 03:42:20.312]  God forbid we try to talk about iodine when they know the IQ increased, IQ point increased by what, 10?
[03:42:20.492 --> 03:42:21.753]  In 10 years?
[03:42:21.813 --> 03:42:24.513]  Or was it 20 in 10 years, just from adding iodine in some areas?
[03:42:24.953 --> 03:42:29.415]  And then they take fluoride, sodium fluoride, and put it in the water, and lowers the IQ.
[03:42:29.755 --> 03:42:36.137]  They take chlorine, or brominated products, and put that in the food supply, and you're just getting the iodine knocked out of you.
[03:42:36.877 --> 03:42:37.678]  I'm trying to bring it back.
[03:42:38.058 --> 03:42:39.539]  Is it a terrible thing?
[03:42:39.559 --> 03:42:40.679]  Well let me ask you this.
[03:42:41.320 --> 03:42:42.500]  Over 300,000 deaths due to pharmaceuticals a year.
[03:42:42.520 --> 03:42:44.201]  Less than 10,000 deaths attributed to guns.
[03:42:44.221 --> 03:42:45.082]  Which one would you ban?
[03:42:52.995 --> 03:43:16.991]  Of course, and then there's a huge, right, and everyone blames the guns, but they don't actually blame the pharmaceuticals, when in reality, a lot of the mega-pharmaceutical companies knew about some of the side effects, which include death, obviously, but then they tried to cover that up, like Eli Lilly and Company in the 1980s knew what Prozac was doing, according to a lot of articles, according to a Harvard professor, I believe it was, who said people were being treated like guinea pigs.
[03:43:17.671 --> 03:43:23.113]  So, look, I appreciate the medical establishment in some ways for what they've done with surgery and everything like that.
[03:43:23.153 --> 03:43:25.974]  If you get in a car accident, you're not going to take iodine, guys.
[03:43:26.574 --> 03:43:26.754]  Right?
[03:43:26.814 --> 03:43:29.315]  You're going to have to get a surgeon, a qualified MD.
[03:43:29.835 --> 03:43:33.677]  And I'm friends with a number of MDs, in fact, who appreciate and respect my stance also.
[03:43:34.517 --> 03:43:38.718]  And including a number of ones that work in hospitals, one that actually owns a major emergency center.
[03:43:39.219 --> 03:43:45.681]  So I get where it comes in, but at the same time, they appreciate and they're learning now, because they never were trained in this in med school.
[03:43:45.701 --> 03:43:52.603]  They weren't trained on iodine and they weren't trained on, they weren't even trained on any nutrition really at all.
[03:43:53.203 --> 03:43:58.905]  So now that they get it, once they look past their propaganda, they say, well, you're actually doing something good, and they take these products.
[03:43:59.525 --> 03:43:59.765]  Right?
[03:44:00.065 --> 03:44:02.606]  So we don't actually have to fight each other that much anymore.
[03:44:02.766 --> 03:44:09.008]  It's just the big pharmaceutical medical establishment claiming that it's some crazy wild idea to take nasonidine.
[03:44:09.048 --> 03:44:13.350]  Some crazy wild idea to take natural, you know, nutraceuticals.
[03:44:13.590 --> 03:44:15.511]  So in my view, I think the debate is over.
[03:44:16.091 --> 03:44:21.252]  There's a whole world of nutrition that we're exploring and we're not going to be stopped by those establishment systems.
[03:44:22.033 --> 03:44:23.053]  Scott, thank you for your call.
[03:44:23.193 --> 03:44:24.874]  Let's go to Tom in Maryland.
[03:44:24.894 --> 03:44:27.335]  He has a question for the great Dr. Group.
[03:44:27.515 --> 03:44:28.375]  Tom, what do you got?
[03:44:29.952 --> 03:44:30.493]  Yes, sir.
[03:44:31.273 --> 03:44:36.878]  Western allopathic doctors, they certainly are not trained in what they should be trained in.
[03:44:37.638 --> 03:44:38.359]  Absolutely not.
[03:44:38.379 --> 03:44:42.362]  And I agree with your take on the nutraceuticals.
[03:44:42.382 --> 03:44:51.210]  I am not that familiar with them, but I'm assuming that they're derived from mostly natural substances.
[03:44:51.330 --> 03:44:58.756]  And I think Dr. Group would agree with me in that most of the really effective pharmaceuticals
[03:44:59.634 --> 03:45:12.571]  Are indeed derived from very natural substances, but they're adulterated to be amped up to exponential degrees where they actually do the body harm.
[03:45:14.150 --> 03:45:16.191]  Well, you're absolutely right about that.
[03:45:16.231 --> 03:45:23.775]  I mean, pharmaceuticals, a long time ago, actually, pharmaceuticals were a little better because they were isolating certain components in plants.
[03:45:24.496 --> 03:45:39.504]  Now, because we're literally running out of plants, and a lot of the plants are becoming extinct, and the pharmaceutical companies don't want to invest billions of dollars in thousands of acres of greenhouses to grow their plants and then extract one tiny compound from them.
[03:45:39.544 --> 03:45:41.325]  So they're learning how to create
[03:45:42.265 --> 03:45:48.389]  Man-made chemical structures which imitate components in plants.
[03:45:48.489 --> 03:45:53.191]  And the problem that we're seeing now is it's really the whole plant that you need.
[03:45:53.251 --> 03:46:02.877]  Yes, what they do is they take the 50 or 60 constituents of a plant and try to figure out which one is acting on that mechanism in the body.
[03:46:03.457 --> 03:46:07.360]  And the sad news is what they look at is
[03:46:08.200 --> 03:46:09.841]  Is it going to shut down that?
[03:46:10.302 --> 03:46:11.682]  Is it going to turn off?
[03:46:11.783 --> 03:46:15.645]  For example, is it going to turn off a pain receptor so you just don't feel the pain?
[03:46:16.246 --> 03:46:17.366]  The pain is still there.
[03:46:17.506 --> 03:46:23.390]  So really what we need to do is we need to focus on the root cause of the problem and say, why is the pain there?
[03:46:23.591 --> 03:46:25.192]  Let's fix the structural issue.
[03:46:25.232 --> 03:46:26.573]  Is it a bone out of position?
[03:46:27.313 --> 03:46:28.334]  Is it a small tear?
[03:46:28.754 --> 03:46:34.398]  Is it the shoes that you're wearing that are causing excess stress on some of the muscles behind your knee?
[03:46:34.418 --> 03:46:37.741]  Let's get to why you're dealing with that condition.
[03:46:37.781 --> 03:46:50.551]  I don't bash medicine, especially acute medicine, because you might need antibiotics to save your life, or you might need surgery, you get in a car accident, you lose a limb so you don't bleed to death.
[03:46:51.231 --> 03:46:55.354]  But the management, the long-term management of chronic illness
[03:46:56.435 --> 03:47:05.457]  Or the treatment of the symptoms of disease instead of addressing the root cause of disease is where we're getting into.
[03:47:05.557 --> 03:47:10.998]  And there are more and more doctors nowadays that are accepting natural methods.
[03:47:11.518 --> 03:47:15.879]  But like everything, okay, there's good medical doctors and there's bad medical doctors.
[03:47:15.919 --> 03:47:18.740]  There's good chiropractors and there's bad chiropractors.
[03:47:18.780 --> 03:47:21.060]  There's good chefs and there's bad chefs.
[03:47:21.080 --> 03:47:23.200]  It's kind of like the government, actually, if you think about it.
[03:47:23.520 --> 03:47:25.521]  There has to be some form of government, right?
[03:47:26.361 --> 03:47:34.083]  Notwithstanding the whole anarchist argument and everything, there has to be some form of government, right, to some degree in the United States or around the world.
[03:47:34.103 --> 03:47:35.263]  There has to be a governing body.
[03:47:35.583 --> 03:47:42.404]  It's only when the government goes beyond and becomes bloated and big and tries to all consume that we have an issue, right?
[03:47:42.424 --> 03:47:47.945]  We have an issue with freedom, we have an issue where the government tries to go beyond its abilities, its written abilities.
[03:47:48.426 --> 03:47:49.406]  That's called a bloated government.
[03:47:49.646 --> 03:47:51.186]  We have a bloated medical establishment.
[03:47:51.206 --> 03:47:54.927]  Because like you said, surgically, we need a medical establishment.
[03:47:55.347 --> 03:48:01.551]  With antibiotics and the production of powerful antibiotics, even though they're misused and given out like candy for no reason.
[03:48:01.931 --> 03:48:06.494]  But that's also a lot of the time from India, because India's just, here, you have a cough, here's an antibiotic.
[03:48:07.055 --> 03:48:09.376]  But there has to be some type of medical establishment.
[03:48:09.396 --> 03:48:12.758]  The problem is when it starts overreaching because of what?
[03:48:13.199 --> 03:48:13.439]  Money.
[03:48:13.939 --> 03:48:25.445]  When it starts going from, yeah, we can operate on you or whatever, oh, but the saline solution that's going to cost you $100 that costs us one cent, and then also you're going to need to get on these painkillers and, oh, you have a neck problem?
[03:48:25.605 --> 03:48:27.566]  Oh, well, let's not look at the actual root cause of that.
[03:48:27.586 --> 03:48:29.707]  You're going to need to be on painkillers for the rest of your life.
[03:48:30.247 --> 03:48:35.670]  Or, oh, you have digestive issues because your microbiome is completely destroyed from all the McDonald's you're eating?
[03:48:35.910 --> 03:48:37.651]  We're not even going to ask about your diet.
[03:48:38.427 --> 03:48:41.948]  Here, get on some anti-inflammatories because you have IBS.
[03:48:41.968 --> 03:48:45.589]  You know, it's just totally insane, where they're overreaching.
[03:48:45.889 --> 03:48:48.309]  But the base is in some ways good.
[03:48:48.349 --> 03:48:58.352]  It's just, it's been overreaching for so far, so long, and so bloated, that we've come with the current medical establishment that says, if you question us, you are evil!
[03:48:58.392 --> 03:48:59.852]  You are a conspiracy theorist!
[03:48:59.892 --> 03:49:00.932]  Just like the government says.
[03:49:01.372 --> 03:49:02.693]  If you question us, you are evil!
[03:49:02.733 --> 03:49:03.933]  You are a conspiracy theorist!
[03:49:04.313 --> 03:49:05.694]  So it's all power grabs.
[03:49:05.774 --> 03:49:07.454]  It's all just this crazy power grab.
[03:49:07.754 --> 03:49:15.100]  And here we are just saying, hey, look at the nutraceuticals we have, look at the information we have, you know, we don't need this whole bloated system, and people are getting behind it.
[03:49:15.760 --> 03:49:21.965]  I mean, I don't really know anyone that pulls the exact government line anymore, or the exact medical establishment line anymore.
[03:49:22.345 --> 03:49:23.006]  It's failing.
[03:49:23.046 --> 03:49:23.966]  It's completely failing.
[03:49:24.327 --> 03:49:25.668]  It's forcing to recede back.
[03:49:25.708 --> 03:49:29.751]  It's like an octopus, and we're slicing off some of the tentacles, and it's having to pull its grip away from us.
[03:49:30.071 --> 03:49:41.254]  No, it's good, and I'm excited to see, even though we do have a lot of things that are going on, and a lot of times we talk about all the negative and the negative, but the good news is there is a lot of positive happening.
[03:49:41.814 --> 03:49:43.095]  People are waking up.
[03:49:43.615 --> 03:49:57.859]  They have seen and gone through the trauma and the emotional scenarios of watching their parents be sick for years and years and years, watching their grandparents die and not remember their name or with Alzheimer's.
[03:49:59.039 --> 03:50:07.566]  The internet has done wonders now because we are getting to the generation where people are saying, wait a second, you know, are there natural alternatives?
[03:50:07.587 --> 03:50:09.188]  That didn't work for my dad.
[03:50:09.248 --> 03:50:11.009]  That didn't work for my grandfather.
[03:50:11.823 --> 03:50:14.887]  You know, we are beginning to open up our mind.
[03:50:14.927 --> 03:50:20.374]  The consciousness is starting to spread and people are asking more questions.
[03:50:20.975 --> 03:50:29.566]  I mean, doctors, medical doctors, I talk to you sometimes, they don't even have the answers half the time for the questions that their patients are asking them.
[03:50:30.026 --> 03:50:32.167]  The big secret is... That was unheard of years ago!
[03:50:32.227 --> 03:50:37.008]  You didn't go and ask your doctor a question because your doctor was God, right?
[03:50:37.248 --> 03:50:37.448]  Yeah.
[03:50:37.528 --> 03:50:40.729]  I mean, so we are changing and people are waking up and that's a good thing.
[03:50:40.789 --> 03:50:42.170]  Well, you know what they do a lot of the time?
[03:50:42.210 --> 03:50:43.610]  This is actually one of the big secrets.
[03:50:44.130 --> 03:50:50.492]  They look on WebMD and correlate the symptoms and look at WebMD and give you an answer based on what WebMD says.
[03:50:50.852 --> 03:50:56.374]  Obviously, they use their expertise too, but they'll just plug it into WebMD a lot of the times and use that as a reference.
[03:50:56.374 --> 03:51:00.640]  Yeah, especially since Google moved all those to the first page and knocked all the natural medicine sites off.
[03:51:00.660 --> 03:51:01.141]  Exactly.
[03:51:01.241 --> 03:51:06.348]  We'll be right back with more news, closing out the hour of the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show Overdrive.
[03:51:06.408 --> 03:51:08.591]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi with Dr. Edward Group.
[03:51:10.495 --> 03:51:18.517]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:19.197 --> 03:51:19.937]  What did I do?
[03:51:20.677 --> 03:51:27.999]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.

[03:54:10.988 --> 03:54:11.729]  We are armed!
[03:54:29.486 --> 03:54:30.246]  Welcome back.
[03:54:30.526 --> 03:54:32.107]  I'm Anthony Gugiardi with Dr. Group.
[03:54:32.127 --> 03:54:39.591]  We're going to finish up by taking your phone calls and answering your questions here with Dr. Group on a variety of health subjects.
[03:54:40.251 --> 03:54:41.652]  Also, a few items in the news.
[03:54:41.712 --> 03:54:47.654]  The number of suicides in Japan has finally dropped below 25,000 for the first time in 18 years.
[03:54:48.054 --> 03:54:59.578]  The total number of suicides that occurred nationwide in 2015 has slipped below 25,000 for the first time since 1997, according to a preliminary report issued by the NPA, National Police Agency.
[03:54:59.598 --> 03:55:08.222]  23,971 people killed themselves in Japan between January 1st and December 31st last year, which is absurd.
[03:55:09.358 --> 03:55:11.580]  Astronauts grow first ever flower in space.
[03:55:11.680 --> 03:55:16.224]  NASA has been working on improving its green thumb in preparation for a future trip to the red planet recently.
[03:55:16.825 --> 03:55:22.150]  Astronauts aboard the cutoff started growing more than demanding started growing flowers in space.
[03:55:23.231 --> 03:55:25.192]  Sometimes when you print these articles it cuts them off.
[03:55:25.553 --> 03:55:27.635]  You know, it's just like the Martian that just came out.
[03:55:27.855 --> 03:55:30.597]  Seems like the Martian was appropriately planned in a number of ways.
[03:55:30.978 --> 03:55:35.301]  Muslims donate 30,000 bottles of water to Flint, Michigan during water crisis.
[03:55:36.431 --> 03:55:46.323]  Muslim organization called Who Is Hussein donated 30,000 bottles of water to the Red Cross in Flint, Michigan on Sunday to help alleviate the water contamination crisis that has gripped the city for months.
[03:55:47.184 --> 03:55:51.449]  Dr. Group, let's go ahead and cut right into Lisa in Canada.
[03:55:51.549 --> 03:55:53.932]  Lisa, you want to talk about thyroid issues.
[03:55:55.003 --> 03:55:56.184]  Yeah, thank you for taking my call.
[03:55:56.744 --> 03:55:57.325]  I appreciate it.
[03:55:57.845 --> 03:55:59.126]  I have a daughter who's 23.
[03:55:59.266 --> 03:56:13.955]  She had a transplant when she was 15 years old for a kidney and went through many struggles, but the latest was her thyroid and she's on anti-rejection meds, small dose of prednisone and Celsept.
[03:56:14.015 --> 03:56:17.077]  I'm not sure if you're familiar with those drugs, but they do wreak havoc on the body.
[03:56:18.284 --> 03:56:20.326]  Let me tell you, actually, I've taken prednisone.
[03:56:20.386 --> 03:56:24.868]  Prednisone gave me the worst reaction I've ever had to anything in my entire life.
[03:56:25.489 --> 03:56:27.170]  It was one of the worst times of my life.
[03:56:27.230 --> 03:56:30.212]  Prednisone, for me, it was terrible.
[03:56:30.252 --> 03:56:31.473]  I felt confused constantly.
[03:56:31.533 --> 03:56:32.133]  I gained weight.
[03:56:32.453 --> 03:56:34.855]  I felt like I thought I was going to literally die.
[03:56:34.915 --> 03:56:36.476]  My face was swollen and red.
[03:56:36.996 --> 03:56:41.279]  Prednisone is a terrible, terrible drug, for me at least.
[03:56:41.459 --> 03:56:43.840]  My side effects, I'm sure it's not everyone.
[03:56:43.900 --> 03:56:44.541]  Anyway, sorry, go ahead.
[03:56:45.730 --> 03:57:13.818]  Unfortunately they're telling us that this is a lifelong thing because she got the transplant while she was a child so when you're an adult you can get off of it but apparently they say as a child you will always be on it once you're on it and we did try to wean her off or actually a doctor tried to get her off and what happened is it triggered a response from her thyroid and they're denying that but it was they cut her off so quickly that I don't think her body
[03:57:14.505 --> 03:57:16.607]  Well, you get addicted to it.
[03:57:16.727 --> 03:57:31.482]  It's a mega anti-inflammatory and if you don't wean off of it in proper doses, like if you're on 10 milligrams a day, you have to go down very, very, very, very slowly because your body, and I'm not an expert on this, but the adrenals, I believe, produce something very similar.
[03:57:31.542 --> 03:57:34.485]  So what happens is your adrenals almost shut down and you have heart issues.
[03:57:34.505 --> 03:57:36.427]  Dr. Group, I don't know if you want to go ahead and comment.
[03:57:36.567 --> 03:57:44.373]  Well, you know, we were talking earlier, and it's endocrine system dysfunction, and the thyroid is one of the major endocrine glands.
[03:57:44.913 --> 03:57:54.461]  So anytime you put prednisone inside the system, which is a steroid, and it's used as an anti-inflammatory, it automatically, number one, lowers the immune system by 50%.
[03:57:55.561 --> 03:58:00.625]  And that is probably one of the most damaging things that you can experience with prednisone.
[03:58:01.266 --> 03:58:04.388]  It sounds like you have a real complicated case with your daughter.
[03:58:06.223 --> 03:58:13.211]  You know, what I would do is I would probably find a really good natural health practitioner that you could work with.
[03:58:13.351 --> 03:58:15.133]  I say, you know, find somebody that's good.
[03:58:15.153 --> 03:58:17.836]  It is really hard, you know, like we were talking about earlier.
[03:58:17.876 --> 03:58:21.160]  You have good nutraceuticals bad, good doctors and not.
[03:58:21.220 --> 03:58:26.907]  But I would say, see if you could find somebody and interview them that you could work with that might be able to walk you through that.
[03:58:28.052 --> 03:58:30.513]  Thank you, Dr. Group, and thank you, everyone, for watching.
[03:58:30.573 --> 03:58:33.354]  This has been the fourth hour of Overdrive.
