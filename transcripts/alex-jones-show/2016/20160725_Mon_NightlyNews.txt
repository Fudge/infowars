[00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.286]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.386 --> 00:00:23.727]  I'm your host, Jakari Jackson.
[00:00:24.027 --> 00:00:27.989]  It is July 25th, 2016, and here's a look at our top stories.
[00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:40.416]  Tonight, the DNC crowd turns against Bernie Sanders when he announces we must elect Hillary.
[00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:45.459]  And we have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine.
[00:00:47.932 --> 00:00:55.021]  Meanwhile, some celebrities show up to support Hillary Clinton, while others are there to protest.
[00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:02.067]  I really want to be on the right side of history, and this is a shot that we're not going to have again in my lifetime.
[00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:11.830]  The mayor of a town in one of Mexico's most violent drug corridors was shot to death, and it's the second mayor killed in two days.
[00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.271]  Plus, a Texas sheriff deputy is shot dead at his own home.
[00:01:17.072 --> 00:01:20.513]  All that plus exclusive reports from the DNC.
[00:01:20.653 --> 00:01:24.154]  That's up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:02.377]  Hi, I'm Dr. David Jones.
[00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:05.420]  I've been in practice for over 30 years in dentistry.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.444]  In our health histories, we've always asked what people's primary complaint were.
[00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:12.006]  A third of the time, it's, I want whiter teeth.
[00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:26.279]  In the early days of dentistry, we used some fairly harsh chemicals in order to bleach the teeth and whiten them, and people were happy with the results, even though it created hypersensitivity and some problems that I consider fairly high risk.
[00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.901]  Recently, I was exposed to the Ghost Smile System.
[00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:36.324]  It allows a whitening gel to be applied to the teeth with a very good ultrasonic toothbrush system.
[00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:51.691]  The gel is activated by a light-emitting diode, or actually two light-emitting diodes, so it's a simple and elegant procedure that delivers office-quality whitening, and you don't have to spend the $600 it typically costs for an in-office treatment.
[00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:55.814]  In my opinion, it's the most elegant and best value that I've ever seen.
[00:02:56.014 --> 00:02:59.817]  To get your Go Smile system, go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.803]  We want to remind you that this Wednesday, or starting this Wednesday, we have Operation Sleeping Giant.
[00:03:06.923 --> 00:03:09.865]  It's our 28-hour broadcast, live broadcast.
[00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:15.690]  We can catch Alex, myself, David Knight, Joe Biggs, Lane McAdoo, all the reporters here.
[00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.434]  And we're going to bring you this historic moment of the Queen Hillary coronation.
[00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:22.595]  We all know it's a big dog and pony show.
[00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:31.759]  They pretty much had her picked as the winner beforehand, but they have to go through it the proper way and have the ballroom and all this other stuff, get all the celebrities and everybody to come out.
[00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:36.462]  And we'll talk about that a little bit later in this broadcast, but definitely mark that broadcast on your calendar.
[00:03:36.742 --> 00:03:37.602]  You do not want to miss it.
[00:03:37.622 --> 00:03:38.983]  That's coming up this Wednesday.
[00:03:39.463 --> 00:03:45.085]  Now, as we're talking about the DNC, one of the big players in the Democratic Party, of course, is Bernie Sanders.
[00:03:45.585 --> 00:03:57.909]  Now, if you guys recall, it wasn't all that long ago, and we've shown you the videos and the montages of Bernie Sanders saying, Mrs. Clinton is unqualified, she's not fit to run this country, she's in bed with the big banks, and what does Bernie do?
[00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.891]  He comes out and burns his supporters by backing the very thing that he was supposed to be
[00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:03.832]  I think so.
[00:04:24.711 --> 00:04:26.853]  And we have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine!
[00:05:01.414 --> 00:05:02.686]  Brothers and sisters!
[00:05:07.162 --> 00:05:19.749]  Following the release of nearly 20,000 internal DNC emails by WikiLeaks last week, Sanders supporters became outraged after evidence revealed that the DNC's efforts were to derail his campaign in favor of Clinton.
[00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:27.394]  So, I'm sure Bernie Sanders knows this, that he pretty much got the business in, so to speak, of this whole Clinton charade.
[00:05:27.734 --> 00:05:29.495]  But, you know, he's backing the party regardless.
[00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:36.719]  I don't know if they promised him or something, but regardless, he's going to back the DNC regardless because they don't want those votes to go to Trump.
[00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:43.369]  And it's really to the point where everybody's running this, anybody except Trump or, you know, never Hillary, whatever.
[00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.632]  It's like you just can't have one or the other.
[00:05:45.813 --> 00:05:47.455]  It's pretty much what it's come down to.
[00:05:47.816 --> 00:05:50.740]  And this is the problem we face every single election cycle.
[00:05:52.543 --> 00:05:54.025]  I hate that it always comes to this.
[00:05:54.425 --> 00:06:02.134]  I tweet out of this thing, I guess a couple months ago, one of my rare tweets, there's this couple there sitting around and it was like, man, our candidate didn't make it.
[00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:05.418]  Now we just have to vote for the other person we don't believe in because they're in our party.
[00:06:05.478 --> 00:06:08.101]  And that's pretty much what happens every four years.
[00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:11.245]  You get down to the final two or three and you have to make this choice.
[00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:12.547]  Are you going to toe the party line?
[00:06:13.027 --> 00:06:15.449]  Are you going to go to the other party or are you just going to sit it out?
[00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:16.690]  And I'm personally going to sit it out.
[00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:22.936]  But many people aren't sitting at home when it comes to Bernie Sanders and also the whole Clinton campaign.
[00:06:23.536 --> 00:06:26.419]  But you know some people who aren't sitting on the bench are the celebrities.
[00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:33.225]  And of course you expect the bigwigs to come out and support their favorite candidate, but not everybody is supporting Mrs. Clinton.
[00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:40.090]  One in particular, Rosario Dawson, the actress who's been in Sin City and Daredevil, many other projects as well.
[00:06:40.811 --> 00:06:46.295]  And she's a diehard Bernie Sanders supporter, and she's coming out to protest against Clinton.
[00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:47.696]  Yeah, that's accurate.
[00:06:48.236 --> 00:06:54.420]  And basically the way Bernie has been treated, she feels that Bernie has gotten a raw deal, as well as many other people feel that way.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.743]  Our crews out there at the DNC and pretty much everybody they meet is saying, no, we don't support Clinton.
[00:06:59.763 --> 00:07:01.044]  We don't want anything to do with Clinton.
[00:07:01.064 --> 00:07:04.586]  They're Bernie bros and Bernie gals, I guess if that's the way you want to put it.
[00:07:04.847 --> 00:07:08.709]  They say, hey, Bernie should be the guy, not Mrs. Clinton.
[00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:09.950]  And many people recognize this.
[00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.571]  They recognize how she had the superdelegates.
[00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:14.231]  Bernie never even stood a chance.
[00:07:14.251 --> 00:07:21.213]  She came in here, she slaughtered him in many different states because she had the superdelegates before he even had a chance to get on the ground and running.
[00:07:21.613 --> 00:07:24.194]  And Rosario's just one of the people out there protesting.
[00:07:24.314 --> 00:07:25.875]  Also actress Susan Sarandon.
[00:07:26.475 --> 00:07:33.297]  You have the supporters of Mrs. Clinton, which include Katy Perry, Lena Dunham, Lady Gaga, and Snoop D-O-double-G.
[00:07:34.077 --> 00:07:50.547]  And it's always interesting to find out which celebrities go for which candidates, because it's getting to the point now, and maybe it's always been this way, but I'm just starting to notice it more, when you find out what celebrity is going for which candidate, you kind of start to feel a certain way about it.
[00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:57.011]  And I know some people, they take it to the extreme if they find out, for example, with this, not Ben Affleck, what's the other guy?
[00:07:57.631 --> 00:07:58.312]  Jason Bourne.
[00:07:58.672 --> 00:07:59.213]  Matt Damon.
[00:07:59.293 --> 00:08:00.314]  Yes, Matt Damon.
[00:08:00.975 --> 00:08:05.460]  He came out with these anti-gun comments saying we need to have Australian-type gun control.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.044]  A lot of people are trying to distance themselves from him for making those comments.
[00:08:09.265 --> 00:08:11.828]  Now, ultimately, do I agree with his comment?
[00:08:11.948 --> 00:08:12.168]  No.
[00:08:12.228 --> 00:08:15.272]  But is he entitled to his opinion here in the United States of America?
[00:08:15.572 --> 00:08:16.132]  Of course he is.
[00:08:16.152 --> 00:08:20.856]  The same thing with all these celebrities who support Mrs. Clinton and her various agendas.
[00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:23.417]  And we'll talk about some of that here in just a little bit.
[00:08:23.757 --> 00:08:26.960]  Now let's talk about somebody who is definitely on board the Clinton machine.
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.661]  That is Washerman Schultz.
[00:08:29.081 --> 00:08:32.163]  And she has been booed offstage by her own delegates.
[00:08:32.503 --> 00:08:33.224]  Good morning Florida!
[00:08:33.244 --> 00:08:42.950]  It is so wonderful to be able to be here in my home, with my home state.
[00:08:45.353 --> 00:08:55.726]  We have a big program.
[00:08:55.766 --> 00:08:58.669]  We have a big program today.
[00:08:58.709 --> 00:08:59.510]  Let's hear.
[00:09:00.011 --> 00:09:01.252]  Let's be respectful.
[00:09:01.813 --> 00:09:02.514]  Please be quiet.
[00:09:02.964 --> 00:09:05.906]  And that was the former DNC chair, or will be soon.
[00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:12.091]  She said she's going to step down at the end of the week because she wants to get on board with the Clinton machine.
[00:09:12.131 --> 00:09:18.135]  Now, when you think about all the people who support Hillary Clinton, I'm very interested as to their reasons as to why they're doing this.
[00:09:18.555 --> 00:09:25.721]  A lot of people will say that she's the most qualified, and to be fair, she's been in politics or in the arena of politics for quite some time.
[00:09:25.761 --> 00:09:29.884]  But you look at her track record, and I'm curious as to what her high points are.
[00:09:30.744 --> 00:09:40.987]  Uh, when I see Benghazi, which is very notable, her lies about getting shot at by snipers, of course the email scandal, and I don't think the email scandal is the biggest thing.
[00:09:41.427 --> 00:09:47.349]  It is a big deal because even the FBI said that she put potential or confidential information at risk.
[00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:51.370]  That in and of itself is a big deal when you look at what's the general portray- portrayous
[00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.552]  Who got in trouble for doing something very similar that was on a much lower scale.
[00:09:56.452 --> 00:09:57.612]  So you have all these things.
[00:09:57.632 --> 00:10:02.234]  What exactly has she done in her career of politics that is just so enlightening?
[00:10:02.314 --> 00:10:06.196]  It's like quality over quantity or quantity over quality.
[00:10:06.416 --> 00:10:11.078]  I'm not exactly seeing the quality in her reign as a political contender.
[00:10:11.478 --> 00:10:12.919]  Meanwhile, you got guys like Trump.
[00:10:13.599 --> 00:10:19.843]  Of course I'm not supporting, but if he says, if everything he says he plans to do, he talks a big game.
[00:10:20.123 --> 00:10:21.324]  But like I said, all it is is talk.
[00:10:21.344 --> 00:10:25.387]  You have campaign promises versus things they can actually do or things that they want to do.
[00:10:25.787 --> 00:10:28.248]  You got all these guys who will tell you things just to get you to the polls.
[00:10:28.589 --> 00:10:30.970]  They may not have any intention of doing what they say.
[00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:39.716]  And also you have the guys who may have a big intention to do something, but is the Congress, is the Senate, are the American people going to get behind them and allow those things to happen?
[00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:41.796]  That's a completely different story.
[00:10:41.816 --> 00:10:43.537]  So that's just one aspect of that.
[00:10:43.917 --> 00:10:53.459]  And as we talk about the Clinton Crime Syndicate, as I've heard them affectionately referred to, one of the big platforms that Mrs. Clinton is running on is her anti-gun agenda.
[00:10:53.499 --> 00:10:58.320]  And we have a special report coming up with James O'Keefe of Project Veritas a little bit later in our show.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.520]  We'll get more into that at that time.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.381]  But briefly, I want to talk about
[00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:09.105]  The big thing that they say here is we need gun control because in other countries we don't have all these attacks.
[00:11:09.385 --> 00:11:13.270]  And we'll have some examples of that coming up, how that's a bunch of bull in just one second.
[00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:21.879]  But briefly, they say that, look at UK or look at Australia or look at these other places where they have less guns and they have less gun violence.
[00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:26.161]  And I do agree with the simple fact, let's say cars for example, right?
[00:11:26.462 --> 00:11:30.684]  If you have some remote village that doesn't have any cars, they're not going to have a lot of accidents.
[00:11:30.804 --> 00:11:31.525]  I understand that.
[00:11:31.845 --> 00:11:34.526]  The simple fact you have cars means you're going to have car accidents.
[00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:40.610]  But when they say that if you look at countries that don't have firearms and they're just this utopia of peace, that is not true.
[00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.511]  Because they'll say, look at the UK, look at this other place.
[00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:45.013]  And my retort to that is look at Mexico.
[00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:49.675]  Where we have this Mexican mayor gunned down, second one in two days.
[00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:53.197]  They've killed two mayors in two days, shot two mayors in two days.
[00:11:53.597 --> 00:11:59.840]  And this is a mayor of a township that includes a known haven for drug traffickers in the Southern Guerrero State.
[00:12:00.241 --> 00:12:10.126]  A spokesman for the Southern Guerrero State said Sunday that gunmen blocked a highway just over the state line with pickup trucks and opened fire on the mayor's vehicle late Sunday.
[00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:15.270]  He said two federal officers serving as Soto's bodyguards were wounded in the attack.
[00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:22.337]  The leftist Democratic Revolution Party said that 75 mayors have been killed in the last decade.
[00:12:22.397 --> 00:12:26.321]  So yeah, they'll show you the crime statistics of the UK and all these other places.
[00:12:26.401 --> 00:12:32.487]  And to be perfectly clear, the UK and other places may have fewer gun deaths or shootings and all that.
[00:12:32.867 --> 00:12:34.328]  But that doesn't mean they have less crime.
[00:12:34.368 --> 00:12:37.911]  You have more muggings, more rapes, more home invasions.
[00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:46.897]  I showed you that story last week in Finland of people, of a guy who was protecting his home when somebody broke into his house with a gun and a baseball bat.
[00:12:47.198 --> 00:12:52.001]  He beat him up and chased him off with a knife and then he went to jail for longer than the guys who broke into his house.
[00:12:52.101 --> 00:12:58.506]  So just because in foreign countries they don't have the same number of firearms that we do doesn't mean that they're these crime-free utopias.
[00:12:58.806 --> 00:13:03.551]  Because you see in Mexico, you get your cartels who have their guns courtesy of Fast and Furious.
[00:13:03.811 --> 00:13:05.453]  They get their guns through other means.
[00:13:05.473 --> 00:13:07.194]  They're out there killing each other in the streets.
[00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:09.577]  And it's not your good law-abiding citizens who are doing this.
[00:13:09.597 --> 00:13:10.798]  It's the cartel members.
[00:13:10.858 --> 00:13:11.639]  It's the gang members.
[00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:15.943]  And if you think about the gun-free zone, let's talk about the ones here in the United States of America.
[00:13:16.003 --> 00:13:20.747]  Your banks, your schools, your liquor stores, your army recruitment facilities, for example.
[00:13:21.868 --> 00:13:24.872]  You guys all saw the picture of the Army Recruitment Facility.
[00:13:24.892 --> 00:13:30.818]  It had bullet holes all around the big gun-free zone sign, so that just shows you how well these things work.
[00:13:30.998 --> 00:13:34.242]  And that's just one example of that article coming out of Mexico.
[00:13:34.693 --> 00:13:37.556]  Now as we're talking about the military, let's talk about a different branch.
[00:13:37.796 --> 00:13:43.601]  Let's talk about the Navy and the waste of money that continues to go through big government contracts.
[00:13:43.641 --> 00:13:44.262]  And we see U.S.
[00:13:44.322 --> 00:13:48.125]  Navy's new $13 billion aircraft carrier can't fight.
[00:13:48.586 --> 00:13:50.507]  And this is the USS Gerald Ford.
[00:13:51.068 --> 00:13:53.050]  It's already two years behind schedule.
[00:13:53.710 --> 00:14:06.158]  And the Navy's newest aircraft carrier is facing more delays after the Pentagon's top weapons tester concluded the ship is still not ready for combat, despite expectations it would be delivered to the fleet this September.
[00:14:07.099 --> 00:14:08.880]  And this reminds me of the other one they had.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.103]  It was that, it was like this big stealth looking, almost like the bat boat.
[00:14:14.443 --> 00:14:16.444]  You know, that's what the thing reminded me of.
[00:14:16.805 --> 00:14:19.266]  And it's like, no, it got out to sea and it just didn't work.
[00:14:19.286 --> 00:14:20.687]  And it was like, well, we put all this money into it.
[00:14:20.707 --> 00:14:21.067]  It's like, well,
[00:14:22.168 --> 00:14:22.668]  I don't know.
[00:14:37.637 --> 00:14:44.259]  I wouldn't have an issue with that, but you build these big ships to go out to fight these preemptive wars, and then you want the American taxpayer to pick up the bill.
[00:14:44.319 --> 00:14:48.280]  Meanwhile, every time something got hot, Obama was threatening not to pay the troops.
[00:14:48.681 --> 00:14:52.742]  I was like, that just blew my mind that people just let that happen and said nothing about it.
[00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:59.144]  Now, something I'm going to say something about is a Texas sheriff was recently shot and shot dead at his home.
[00:14:59.264 --> 00:15:01.345]  Now, this was a sheriff
[00:15:02.225 --> 00:15:04.287]  He heard a noise in his backyard.
[00:15:04.307 --> 00:15:05.307]  He went out there to check it out.
[00:15:05.347 --> 00:15:08.330]  This is Round Rock, Texas, just a little bit north of Austin.
[00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:14.755]  But they say the shooting was not believed to be a targeted attack of a law enforcement officer.
[00:15:14.775 --> 00:15:16.976]  They just thought it was a routine robbery.
[00:15:17.337 --> 00:15:19.178]  The guy just came up on the wrong end of it.
[00:15:19.338 --> 00:15:24.382]  And of course, this isn't going to do anything to help the police relations going on here in the country.
[00:15:24.442 --> 00:15:26.303]  Currently, because we've seen
[00:15:27.384 --> 00:15:35.693]  Numerous reports, tweets of various groups coming out saying target police, you know, shoot them while they're pumping gas or go to their houses and target their children.
[00:15:35.794 --> 00:15:39.057]  All types of craziness and these things just go on to fuel this thing.
[00:15:39.458 --> 00:15:47.587]  It's just like I was talking about with somebody when you had the story last week of the autistic man who was walking around with his toy truck and his caregiver came out there.
[00:15:48.067 --> 00:15:51.330]  And people were calling the cops saying, hey, this guy had a gun, he had a toy truck.
[00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.753]  It's the same thing when people call the cops on people who carry umbrellas or other things.
[00:15:55.793 --> 00:15:59.196]  We've seen schools get shut down because some kid showed up with an umbrella.
[00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:03.820]  And you have to realize that when you call the cops and you say somebody's out here with a gun,
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.682]  Their mentality is going to be completely different as if you called and said, hey, my neighbor has loud music playing.
[00:16:09.762 --> 00:16:12.524]  Because when you say this guy has a gun, they're getting psyched up.
[00:16:12.564 --> 00:16:13.544]  They're trying to get mentally prepared.
[00:16:13.564 --> 00:16:14.685]  They're running through all these scenarios.
[00:16:14.965 --> 00:16:22.108]  And lo and behold, as in the case with the autistic man, an innocent man got shot because somebody chose to call the cops on an innocent person.
[00:16:22.368 --> 00:16:31.152]  Now, of course, if you see some guys sneaking around your neighborhood, you think they're sneaking around your neighborhood, you may take a look at them, but definitely know what you're doing before you pick up that phone and make that final call.
[00:16:32.032 --> 00:16:37.896]  Now, we've seen a series of attacks going on worldwide, but this one we're going to focus on in Germany.
[00:16:37.936 --> 00:16:54.267]  This is one of many recent attacks, and this is a Syrian suicide bomber, and the attacker detonated a bomb backpack with metal shavings outside of a bar near Nuremberg, and he was a 27-year-old Syrian man who was denied asylum and turned away from a music festival.
[00:16:54.707 --> 00:16:57.328]  The blast left 15 people injured, three seriously.
[00:16:57.748 --> 00:17:01.048]  And it's the fourth bloody attack on German soil in the past week.
[00:17:01.549 --> 00:17:05.209]  And the man had previously been treated for psychiatric care.
[00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.130]  He had sworn his allegiance to ISIS.
[00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.271]  They found bomb-making materials in his apartment.
[00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:14.892]  And he was also due to be deported to Bulgaria.
[00:17:14.932 --> 00:17:17.132]  And these are the reasons why you have a border.
[00:17:17.172 --> 00:17:18.673]  I meet these people and say, we don't need a border.
[00:17:18.733 --> 00:17:19.853]  I'm like, OK, I'm not
[00:17:20.393 --> 00:17:23.074]  Trying to discriminate against people, but you have a border there for a reason.
[00:17:23.094 --> 00:17:26.295]  You have customs there for a reason, and this is the type of thing that you try to avoid.
[00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:34.257]  And very quickly, we talk about the censorship here in the United States of America, and now China's going so far as they're cracking down on news organizations, putting out information.
[00:17:34.537 --> 00:17:39.498]  You can read that at your leisure, but for right now, stay tuned right after this break for more special reports.
[00:17:52.970 --> 00:18:02.556]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:18:03.016 --> 00:18:04.737]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:05.478]  Think about it.
[00:18:05.678 --> 00:18:11.461]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:18:11.721 --> 00:18:17.285]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:18:17.665 --> 00:18:29.432]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:32.473]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:35.135]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:18:35.455 --> 00:18:39.897]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:18:40.338 --> 00:18:40.918]  Think about it.
[00:18:41.118 --> 00:18:47.963]  This is Darren McBreen, and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:18:48.223 --> 00:18:52.367]  And listen to the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on in your mind.
[00:19:01.253 --> 00:19:02.794]  Hillary for prison shirts are $19.95.
[00:19:02.854 --> 00:19:04.776]  We've been selling them as low as $5.
[00:19:04.896 --> 00:19:06.377]  I want to get tens of thousands of them out there.
[00:19:06.397 --> 00:19:08.319]  There's like 80,000 of them now out there or something.
[00:19:09.189 --> 00:19:10.170]  They're all over the country.
[00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.431]  It's one of the top memes in the nation.
[00:19:11.691 --> 00:19:15.693]  But at $19.95, we can take all the proceeds and pay for aircraft from the skies.
[00:19:15.974 --> 00:19:17.375]  You've seen that be national news.
[00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:18.996]  You've seen that be the top meme in the country.
[00:19:19.036 --> 00:19:19.516]  It's amazing.
[00:19:20.056 --> 00:19:21.938]  We're leading the way on how to resist.
[00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:23.459]  We're ragtag.
[00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:25.580]  We're cross-eyed and exhausted half the time.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.841]  But we've got the passion.
[00:19:26.861 --> 00:19:27.722]  We're going over the top.
[00:19:28.122 --> 00:19:30.944]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:19:31.184 --> 00:19:38.948]  I'm selling at $19.95 to pay for the banners, to pay for the 18-wheelers with the big signs, to pay for the Jumbotron videos, and it's really paying off.
[00:19:38.968 --> 00:19:40.969]  Hundreds of newspapers, TV, Hillary for President.
[00:19:41.569 --> 00:19:45.131]  You cannot, but all the shirts we sell, all the ones we have, it's like $60,000.
[00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:47.752]  So, but we got more being printed right now.
[00:19:47.792 --> 00:19:55.756]  Everybody's got to go buy a Hillary for President shirt for $19.95, show that in full or so you can get on the whole, because I want to really go crazy with airplanes at the DNC.
[00:19:56.096 --> 00:19:57.257]  We're looking at blimps as well.
[00:19:57.677 --> 00:19:58.598]  We're not going to be censored.
[00:19:58.659 --> 00:19:59.820]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.322]  Get your Hillary for President shirts today.
[00:20:01.683 --> 00:20:03.886]  Look in the last eight months how far that meme's come.
[00:20:04.167 --> 00:20:08.293]  In one block that I walked just a minute ago, I saw 15 of those shirts.
[00:20:08.713 --> 00:20:09.735]  Just in one block!
[00:20:10.276 --> 00:20:12.659]  The drive here from my spot where I'm staying.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.001]  30, 40 tons of them.
[00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:17.382]  They're every single winner.
[00:20:17.402 --> 00:20:22.324]  The rally yesterday, almost everyone in the crowd had on a Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[00:20:22.485 --> 00:20:23.645]  It is amazing.
[00:20:24.365 --> 00:20:27.047]  Everyone stops and they go, what does that shirt mean?
[00:20:27.107 --> 00:20:27.407]  Why?
[00:20:27.487 --> 00:20:28.828]  Why does she need to go to prison?
[00:20:29.088 --> 00:20:35.311]  And it allows us to engage in a conversation and teach these people who have no clue about who Hillary really is.
[00:20:35.871 --> 00:20:37.593]  About all the things she's been involved in.
[00:20:37.633 --> 00:20:38.854]  And we're not laying down to that witch.
[00:20:38.894 --> 00:20:40.416]  She's not, she's not going to buffalo us.
[00:20:40.696 --> 00:20:41.417]  We're not coward.
[00:20:41.437 --> 00:20:42.218]  We're not broke back.
[00:20:42.238 --> 00:20:42.979]  We're taking action.
[00:20:42.999 --> 00:20:43.499]  What about you?
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.741]  Get your Hillary for President shirt.
[00:20:44.761 --> 00:20:45.482]  I know you already have one.
[00:20:45.522 --> 00:20:45.942]  Buy another one.
[00:20:46.182 --> 00:20:47.123]  Give it to friends and family.
[00:20:47.464 --> 00:20:50.247]  I'm telling you, the war is now, the war is an info war.
[00:20:50.487 --> 00:20:51.068]  We're going to win.
[00:20:51.568 --> 00:20:54.291]  It's now been duplicated by countless groups and I think that's wonderful.
[00:20:55.273 --> 00:21:02.196]  Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and now it's all over CNN, it's all over Fox, it's all over the Trump rallies, the Hillary rallies.
[00:21:02.556 --> 00:21:09.618]  The number one search term for a week straight, last week, and still continuing, one of the top search terms is, is Hillary going to jail?
[00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.059]  This has been incredibly successful.
[00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:16.701]  Because it shows, despite corporate control, and despite them trying to control the meme,
[00:21:17.341 --> 00:21:19.663]  We've had three versions of the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[00:21:20.183 --> 00:21:23.606]  All of them have been collector's edition and have helped fund the InfoWar.
[00:21:24.186 --> 00:21:26.748]  We now have a third edition in.
[00:21:26.989 --> 00:21:28.310]  The second edition sold out.
[00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:45.223]  It's the same as the last, but on the right shoulder says InfoWars.com, on the back it says InfoWars.com, legalized freedom, be part of history, be part of supporting the InfoWar, be part of meeting like-minded friends and family.
[00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:53.975]  Get your Hillary for Prison 2016 3rd Wave Shirts at InfoWarStore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:22:01.394 --> 00:22:01.874]  Not a group.
[00:22:01.914 --> 00:22:03.314]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:22:03.354 --> 00:22:04.435]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:22:04.695 --> 00:22:05.615]  Why is this so good?
[00:22:05.895 --> 00:22:11.136]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:22:11.216 --> 00:22:24.780]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.200]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.581]  Spreading disease around.
[00:22:28.642 --> 00:22:31.124]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:32.485]  These are all parasites.
[00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:33.646]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:34.687]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:22:34.987 --> 00:22:39.330]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:22:39.531 --> 00:22:42.693]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:22:42.713 --> 00:22:45.876]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:22:45.916 --> 00:22:46.917]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:22:46.957 --> 00:22:47.477]  Living Defense.
[00:22:47.777 --> 00:22:48.838]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:48.898 --> 00:22:49.919]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:22:49.939 --> 00:22:51.961]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:22:53.522 --> 00:22:54.504]  You support the broadcast.
[00:22:54.564 --> 00:22:55.646]  Infowarslives.com.
[00:22:55.907 --> 00:22:57.810]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:22:58.171 --> 00:23:00.154]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:23:06.578 --> 00:23:18.989]  Whether it's Russia or China, Iran or North Korea, more and more countries are using hacking to steal our information to use it to their advantage and we can't let that go on.
[00:23:19.289 --> 00:23:25.855]  Spoken just like a former Secretary of State that put national security in jeopardy for her own selfish gain.
[00:23:26.215 --> 00:23:36.418]  The Clinton campaign is pointing its crooked finger at the Russians as the culprits responsible for hacking the emails of the Democratic National Committee going all the way back to last summer.
[00:23:36.618 --> 00:23:48.762]  John Podesta, the chairman of the 2016 Hillary presidential campaign, claims Russian President Vladimir Putin is aiding Donald Trump's campaign because there is a kind of bromance going on.
[00:23:49.022 --> 00:23:54.944]  As if one more fabrication of reality could sway the narrative back to the Democrats' camp.
[00:23:55.244 --> 00:24:05.628]  And whether the Russians actually hacked the DNC emails or if it was the Romanian hacker claiming responsibility known as Guccifer 2.0 really doesn't matter.
[00:24:05.828 --> 00:24:12.831]  What matters now is that the American people know how riddled with deception the DNC truly is.
[00:24:13.211 --> 00:24:19.919]  The political machinery propping up Hillary's campaign is quickly coming apart at the moment she should be dominating.
[00:24:20.099 --> 00:24:30.392]  The released 19,252 WikiLeaks internal emails that were hacked from seven officials at the DNC have served as a battering ram.
[00:24:30.572 --> 00:24:31.433]  We're good to go.
[00:24:49.409 --> 00:24:56.173]  Relegating the DNC's mainstream media counterparts to nothing less than a larger propaganda organization.
[00:24:56.413 --> 00:25:08.780]  In this email, DNC's National Press Secretary, Mark Postenbach, says of a political reporter, Ken Vogel, Vogel gave me his story ahead of time, before it goes to his editors, as long as I didn't share it.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.202]  Let me know if you see anything that's missing and I'll push back.
[00:25:12.382 --> 00:25:15.204]  Here's the Buzzfeed News Latino coverage editor,
[00:25:15.524 --> 00:25:21.772]  Adrian Caraschillo introducing a top Democratic operative to BuzzFeed's communications director.
[00:25:21.992 --> 00:25:28.100]  Here are two DNC reps discussing sending out fake anti-Trump protesters at the RNC.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:34.348]  It reads, Yes, but going forward, when our allies screw up and don't deliver bodies in time,
[00:25:34.608 --> 00:25:38.470]  We either send all our interns out there or we stay away from it.
[00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.611]  We don't want to own a bad picture.
[00:25:40.791 --> 00:25:42.512]  The fallout is extensive.
[00:25:42.592 --> 00:25:48.734]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz gave a speech to officially announce that she is stepping down as the DNC chair.
[00:25:48.994 --> 00:25:51.115]  That announcement was met with this.
[00:25:51.135 --> 00:25:54.937]  Alright everybody now, settle down.
[00:25:57.238 --> 00:25:58.739]  Everybody settle down please.
[00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:01.940]  Okay.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.763]  Alright, we have a big program.
[00:26:05.224 --> 00:26:06.806]  We have a big program today.
[00:26:06.866 --> 00:26:13.495]  Let's hear... And at this point, the attempt to co-op Bernie supporters would only anger those supporters more.
[00:26:13.874 --> 00:26:16.495]  My message is to Hillary Clinton, drop out.
[00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:20.257]  You have made a mockery of our democracy.
[00:26:20.417 --> 00:26:24.399]  She's part of the Clinton crime family and she needs to be put in prison right away.
[00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:33.183]  What her and Debbie Wasserman Schultz did to all of the voters in this country is unfathomable that they haven't put her in jail yet.
[00:26:33.544 --> 00:26:40.507]  Hillary Clinton's followers have no problem and they have denied election fraud.
[00:26:40.667 --> 00:26:42.388]  Hillary Clinton is in a syndicate.
[00:26:43.832 --> 00:26:46.953]  And now, James O'Keefe of Project Veritas has gotten video evidence of the deception that fuels the DNC.
[00:27:15.336 --> 00:27:19.342]  The DNC is turning out to be far more of a train wreck than expected.
[00:27:19.622 --> 00:27:24.409]  This is what happens when American Providence is insulted for far too long.
[00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.853]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:27:41.601 --> 00:27:43.242]  My message is to Hillary Clinton.
[00:27:43.322 --> 00:27:44.263]  Drop out.
[00:27:44.443 --> 00:27:47.646]  You have made a mockery of our democracy.
[00:27:47.686 --> 00:27:51.309]  She's not a progressive candidate and I don't intend to vote for her in November.
[00:27:51.949 --> 00:28:01.677]  I'll be voting for Jill Stein if the Democratic establishment has their way and proceeds with the coronation of Hillary despite the will of the people being behind Bernie Sanders.
[00:28:02.397 --> 00:28:04.639]  How would you describe Hillary in your own words?
[00:28:07.661 --> 00:28:09.383]  I think I'll go with Donald Trump's on this one.
[00:28:09.423 --> 00:28:09.863]  She's crooked.
[00:28:10.356 --> 00:28:13.619]  Hillary Clinton's followers have no problem and they have denied election fraud.
[00:28:13.639 --> 00:28:15.581]  Hillary Clinton is in a syndicate.
[00:28:34.141 --> 00:28:34.781]  Well, I mean...
[00:28:55.185 --> 00:29:01.109]  She's been corrupt since 92, when Bill was elected, and now it's just getting that much worse.
[00:29:01.189 --> 00:29:04.712]  I mean, she made, what, $21 million from speaking to different banks and Wall Streeters?
[00:29:04.732 --> 00:29:05.032]  Yeah.
[00:29:05.592 --> 00:29:10.176]  Well, do you think a lot of those, quote, speaking fees were kickbacks or deals?
[00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.096]  I think anyone who doesn't is naive.
[00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:13.777]  Now listen, Hillary Clinton.
[00:29:13.857 --> 00:29:14.897]  I didn't vote for you in 08.
[00:29:15.557 --> 00:29:18.138]  I voted for Obama because he wasn't you.
[00:29:18.798 --> 00:29:19.418]  You know what?
[00:29:19.658 --> 00:29:20.498]  You're a liar.
[00:29:20.778 --> 00:29:21.438]  You're a cheat.
[00:29:21.458 --> 00:29:23.999]  We don't raise our children to act this way.
[00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:25.479]  And you're gonna further it?
[00:29:25.739 --> 00:29:28.860]  You got superdelegates that you bought before the election?
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.900]  I'm in Michigan, Hillary.
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.981]  We uncrowned you, you fracking queen.
[00:29:34.241 --> 00:29:35.521]  And I'm gonna tell you what.
[00:29:35.901 --> 00:29:38.902]  All you superdelegates that are standing behind you in Michigan,
[00:29:39.302 --> 00:29:43.607]  The finger isn't on them when it comes August and November to vote.
[00:29:44.067 --> 00:29:45.349]  We're voting you out.
[00:29:45.629 --> 00:29:46.970]  We're going for a new Congress.
[00:29:47.311 --> 00:29:49.713]  You don't win anything because we're not going away.
[00:29:50.314 --> 00:29:54.618]  Our job is just beginning and our job is to shut you down.
[00:29:55.499 --> 00:29:57.241]  F you Hillary Clinton.
[00:29:57.421 --> 00:30:01.165]  All day I've noticed a disconnect between Bernie supporters and
[00:30:02.106 --> 00:30:02.726]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:30:03.906 --> 00:30:08.767]  I've interviewed probably nearly a dozen people so far at several different protests.
[00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:11.168]  Not one of them told me they were going to vote for Hillary.
[00:30:11.668 --> 00:30:12.048]  No.
[00:30:13.088 --> 00:30:17.909]  I haven't found... The only Hillary supporters I've found here is CNN.
[00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:23.530]  CNN... I probably shouldn't say that.
[00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.190]  That's kind of mean, actually.
[00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:30.071]  But I haven't run into any Hillary supporters.
[00:30:30.936 --> 00:30:31.296]  Neither.
[00:30:31.376 --> 00:30:34.379]  What do you think about Hillary Clinton's support for TPP?
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.841]  I think it's phony.
[00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:44.127]  Basically she called it the gold rule of trade agreements and now during the campaign she flip-flopped to try to keep up with Bernie Sanders.
[00:30:46.369 --> 00:30:47.630]  She'll pass it.
[00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:52.193]  They're going to try to pass it through after November between her and then.
[00:30:52.254 --> 00:30:55.636]  If they don't pass it then I'm sure she's going to make a good excuse to pass it.
[00:30:55.857 --> 00:30:56.637]  I don't trust her.
[00:30:56.657 --> 00:30:58.098]  I'm not voting for her.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:00.641]  Simple as that.
[00:31:00.861 --> 00:31:02.362]  I'm not voting corporation.
[00:31:02.803 --> 00:31:03.624]  Hillary cheats.
[00:31:03.984 --> 00:31:08.108]  Now, the last couple of weeks, she's not up in double digits against Trump.
[00:31:08.409 --> 00:31:10.911]  She's into two or four points.
[00:31:10.951 --> 00:31:16.317]  She is losing in swing states, which has not happened in decades.
[00:31:16.517 --> 00:31:17.838]  They'll support Jill Stein.
[00:31:18.679 --> 00:31:21.722]  Some of them might go to Gary Johnson, some of them might go to Stein, but...
[00:31:22.863 --> 00:31:25.405]  I would say 80% of them are not voting for Hillary.
[00:31:25.565 --> 00:31:32.950]  If they want to anoint that little effing whatever she is, we're gonna lose to Trump and it's on them.
[00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:37.633]  The games that they played and what they have done to us, good luck in November.
[00:31:37.873 --> 00:31:44.277]  You don't have our vote, you don't have our money, and Trump's gonna flatten you like a pancake, Hillary.
[00:31:46.561 --> 00:31:48.042]  David Nye from Infowars.com.
[00:31:48.062 --> 00:31:55.584]  Now we're walking by this merchandising place and we had even delegates talking about the difference between these two pictures.
[00:31:55.624 --> 00:32:01.406]  You see the way Hillary is portrayed out here very majestically in kind of a communist propaganda mode.
[00:32:01.727 --> 00:32:03.447]  But look at what they did to Bernie's picture.
[00:32:03.867 --> 00:32:10.370]  I mean, it looks kind of like a cross between Bernie Sanders and Mickey Mouse, the way they drew his nose out and the low part of his face.
[00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.472]  That's one of the worst caricatures I've ever seen of him.
[00:32:13.972 --> 00:32:17.995]  A striking contrast, but that's what we're seeing more of here at the delegation.
[00:32:18.015 --> 00:32:27.862]  And of course, just this afternoon, Bernie Sanders gave his first speech, and as he was encouraging his supporters to support Hillary Clinton, he was booed by his own supporters.
[00:32:28.442 --> 00:32:30.103]  Because this is about more than one man.
[00:32:30.123 --> 00:32:39.767]  This is about whether or not we're going to have honest and open elections, or whether we're going to allow the party establishment of both parties to try to rig this process.
[00:32:39.847 --> 00:32:46.970]  Of course, that didn't happen with the Republicans because Donald Trump shut them down, but that hasn't happened here with the Democrats.
[00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.411]  Interesting contrast.
[00:32:48.791 --> 00:32:51.732]  It says it all right here in these images of the merchandise.
[00:32:52.512 --> 00:32:53.713]  David Nye for InfoWars.com.
[00:33:02.523 --> 00:33:07.988]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.528 --> 00:33:09.049]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.449 --> 00:33:12.492]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.173 --> 00:33:13.633]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.833 --> 00:33:16.436]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.756 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.877 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all the essential amino acids, all the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!
[00:35:55.418 --> 00:35:59.441]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.690]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.031 --> 00:36:46.696]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.896 --> 00:36:53.022]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:36:53.322 --> 00:36:57.065]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:37:09.406 --> 00:37:11.067]  I don't know.
[00:37:43.894 --> 00:37:55.337]  Rob Dewitt with Infowars.com reporting just outside Independence Hall and we ran in, we're in the park over here, James O'Keefe, master confronter, master hidden camera artist, just really an activist taking it to the next level.
[00:37:55.757 --> 00:37:58.018]  And you had a confrontation this morning, so tell us all about it.
[00:37:58.038 --> 00:38:11.262]  Yeah, we caught this Hillary delegate on tape, Mary Bayer is her name, and she says on hidden camera, she's a delegate for Hillary Clinton, she says the way to ban all guns is to tell people that you want common sense gun legislation and she says
[00:38:11.482 --> 00:38:12.463]  This is the quote from the video.
[00:38:12.483 --> 00:38:12.783]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:13.783]  Can I see this?
[00:38:13.804 --> 00:38:14.324]  Excuse me, hey.
[00:38:14.364 --> 00:38:15.204]  That's my property.
[00:38:15.224 --> 00:38:16.105]  She's taking my property.
[00:38:16.145 --> 00:38:16.765]  She's grabbing it.
[00:38:37.559 --> 00:38:39.860]  That's my property.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.541]  That's my property.
[00:38:40.581 --> 00:38:42.842]  The delegate took my property.
[00:38:42.962 --> 00:38:44.924]  Officer, she took, she has my sign.
[00:38:44.984 --> 00:38:48.646]  Oh yeah, it's on YouTube, it's on Alex Jones right now.
[00:38:48.666 --> 00:38:49.547]  Who is Alex Jones?
[00:38:49.587 --> 00:38:51.888]  He's a journalist.
[00:38:51.968 --> 00:38:54.310]  And I'm James O'Keefe, I'm with Project Veritas.
[00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:56.933]  Can you explain what the goal of your organization is?
[00:38:57.073 --> 00:39:01.057]  It's to expose the truth and expose lies and corruption from people like you.
[00:39:01.097 --> 00:39:02.419]  So, you're saying I told a lie?
[00:39:02.439 --> 00:39:02.879]  You did.
[00:39:02.939 --> 00:39:03.480]  It's on video.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.301]  What is my lie?
[00:39:04.341 --> 00:39:05.142]  Can you tell me?
[00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:10.327]  You said, quote, you guys say you want common sense, fun legislation, you say shit like that, and people buy into it.
[00:39:10.367 --> 00:39:12.109]  Well, what did somebody say to make you say that?
[00:39:12.169 --> 00:39:13.851]  Was this like four years ago or something?
[00:39:13.871 --> 00:39:15.273]  He said, how do you ban guns?
[00:39:15.673 --> 00:39:17.373]  And you explained how to do it.
[00:39:17.433 --> 00:39:19.154]  Have you guys ever talked about this?
[00:39:19.234 --> 00:39:20.374]  I've never talked about this.
[00:39:20.494 --> 00:39:21.194]  I'm sorry.
[00:39:21.314 --> 00:39:24.775]  I'm pretty sure... I don't understand you, but this was... It's on videotape.
[00:39:24.835 --> 00:39:26.715]  Well, I'm giving you some context to defend myself.
[00:39:26.795 --> 00:39:27.976]  Why did you take it and have it?
[00:39:28.016 --> 00:39:29.516]  Why did you take it and have it?
[00:39:29.536 --> 00:39:33.177]  Because that's my picture and you're walking around and saying bad things about me.
[00:39:33.197 --> 00:39:33.837]  I'm a human being.
[00:39:33.977 --> 00:39:35.197]  You guys have to go outside.
[00:39:43.442 --> 00:39:46.085]  So James, how do you think it's possible she doesn't even know who Alex Jones is?
[00:39:46.585 --> 00:39:47.566]  Well, I don't know.
[00:39:47.666 --> 00:39:49.568]  She was so flabbergasted.
[00:39:49.588 --> 00:39:50.409]  She was emotional.
[00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:51.730]  She was running through the lobby.
[00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.012]  She was saying, that's my picture.
[00:39:54.032 --> 00:39:54.973]  That's my word.
[00:39:55.053 --> 00:40:00.699]  She just couldn't believe that she was on tape and she was denying what she was... She was in a state of complete denial.
[00:40:00.719 --> 00:40:02.761]  And that she was being confronted over her own words.
[00:40:02.941 --> 00:40:13.168]  Yes, and she is a delegate for Clinton, and she's describing, she doesn't know she's being filmed, but she described how they're going to get all the guns banned, and she's lying to the American people.
[00:40:13.468 --> 00:40:13.928]  Exactly.
[00:40:14.248 --> 00:40:17.611]  Now I like what you have, you have a shirt on here that says I'm secretly recording you, and a hat.
[00:40:17.951 --> 00:40:21.493]  This is one way to get away from the two-party consent which is in Pennsylvania.
[00:40:21.513 --> 00:40:22.774]  In Cleveland it was one-party consent.
[00:40:22.794 --> 00:40:27.017]  So my lawyer said, you know, you gotta let people know you're filming them in Pennsylvania, so here I have the shirt.
[00:40:27.637 --> 00:40:30.539]  Project Veritas, I am secretly recording you.
[00:40:30.659 --> 00:40:32.980]  That way everyone's got the consent.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.381]  I can film everyone.
[00:40:34.421 --> 00:40:35.141]  There's no problem.
[00:40:35.161 --> 00:40:39.283]  There's no legal issues in Pennsylvania, which is a two-party consent state to take.
[00:40:39.604 --> 00:40:44.807]  Now, if you are in public spaces, you can film people secretly because there's no perception of privacy.
[00:40:45.167 --> 00:40:48.108]  So just keep in mind the laws out there because they are different from state to state.
[00:40:48.168 --> 00:40:49.449]  James, do you have anything else you want to add?
[00:40:49.909 --> 00:40:56.513]  I would just say, one by one, we're going to expose all the people, all the delegates, and this is the hashtag, the catch a delegate.
[00:40:57.213 --> 00:40:59.818]  And follow us on ProjectVeritas.com.
[00:41:00.459 --> 00:41:03.744]  Alright, you heard here at InfoWars.com, hashtag to catch a delegate.
[00:41:04.005 --> 00:41:06.990]  This is Rob Drew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:41:18.063 --> 00:41:19.705]  I wish we could share the pain of both.
[00:41:19.725 --> 00:41:21.166]  Because those who were shot unarmed,
[00:41:39.147 --> 00:41:40.128]  Did nothing to be killed.
[00:41:40.148 --> 00:41:42.949]  And the police was shot unarmed, did nothing to be killed.
[00:41:43.429 --> 00:41:46.211]  That must be some common commitment to stop the killing.
[00:41:46.291 --> 00:41:54.155]  I think that for a season, from Trayvon Martin to Michael Brown to Diallo, it was black men killed by police.
[00:41:54.875 --> 00:42:00.418]  The killing of police by people, by two veterans I might add, is a recent thing.
[00:42:00.458 --> 00:42:04.941]  But I hope that can be an appreciation for the pain and unnecessary loss of both sides.
[00:42:05.041 --> 00:42:07.182]  Do you think that they should have them speak?
[00:42:08.214 --> 00:42:13.303]  Do you think they should have had someone from the families that have just recently had the most recent shootings in Dallas?
[00:42:13.724 --> 00:42:15.327]  They may make an adjustment.
[00:42:15.347 --> 00:42:16.028]  I hope that they will.
[00:42:16.709 --> 00:42:16.950]  Thank you.
[00:42:18.613 --> 00:42:20.494]  Alright, David Knight for Infowars.com.
[00:42:20.534 --> 00:42:24.115]  That was Jesse Jackson here on the floor of the Democrat National Convention.
[00:42:24.315 --> 00:42:27.156]  We're here at the convention and I'm talking to a Bernie delegate.
[00:42:27.176 --> 00:42:27.736]  Your name is, sir?
[00:42:28.336 --> 00:42:31.297]  I'm Charles Powell from Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[00:42:31.898 --> 00:42:33.078]  Well, I see you're a Bernie delegate.
[00:42:33.098 --> 00:42:34.658]  I also see you're against the TPP.
[00:42:34.698 --> 00:42:37.579]  Tell me how you feel about how the convention's proceeding so far.
[00:42:37.819 --> 00:42:43.862]  Well, I don't like it that they didn't recommend that the
[00:42:46.067 --> 00:42:52.529]  TPP not be voted on before the next election.
[00:42:52.989 --> 00:43:03.892]  We think that the lame duck Congress should not vote on the TPP and to give the new Congress a chance to think it over.
[00:43:05.312 --> 00:43:09.654]  So we're disappointed that it doesn't look like it's going to go that way.
[00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:14.135]  But they didn't allow the minority report
[00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:23.636]  On the TPP and we're still hoping that we can at least force them to hear the minority report.
[00:43:24.137 --> 00:43:32.843]  Do you think there's any interest in hearing opposition to TPP based on Hillary Clinton's vice presidential pick of Cain who is very supportive of it and all the trade agreements?
[00:43:33.383 --> 00:43:43.185]  Well, she has, you know, indicated that she thinks that we should be cautious about the TPP.
[00:43:43.825 --> 00:43:48.386]  And of course, Bernie was strongly against the TPP.
[00:43:49.166 --> 00:43:56.888]  And so there are both Bernie delegates and Hillary delegates that are opposed to TPP.
[00:43:58.008 --> 00:44:07.030]  So, hopefully we, as a group, a unified group, can do something about stopping TPP.
[00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:14.751]  Well, we see Wall Street Journal and other sources rejoicing that Hillary Clinton has picked Kaine as her Vice President because he is so in it.
[00:44:14.771 --> 00:44:22.492]  Of course, she had supported it before she opposed it, and now, you know, at least Wall Street believes that it's a done deal.
[00:44:22.552 --> 00:44:26.413]  Well, it certainly doesn't look good, so it's reason for concern.
[00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:30.380]  But I haven't given up yet.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:35.002]  I still have high hopes and there are others that feel that way.
[00:44:35.502 --> 00:44:40.824]  And we think if we can at least force the minority report to be heard.
[00:44:41.865 --> 00:44:45.746]  We're here just outside the convention floor as the delegates are about to go in.
[00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:47.227]  We're going to be starting in about 45 minutes.
[00:44:48.527 --> 00:44:52.949]  We had a delegate come over to us, saw our equipment, and he was a Bernie supporter.
[00:44:53.429 --> 00:44:55.570]  He was very upset about what's going on.
[00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:57.951]  We asked him to speak to us on record.
[00:44:57.991 --> 00:45:02.393]  He said, well, tomorrow or after we do the roll call vote, I'll talk to you about it.
[00:45:02.553 --> 00:45:06.034]  He doesn't want to get thrown off the floor before the roll call vote.
[00:45:06.495 --> 00:45:10.116]  But we're going to have a lot of people talking to us, I'm sure, because they're very upset about this.
[00:45:10.436 --> 00:45:11.417]  You know, you have to understand.
[00:45:12.017 --> 00:45:19.002]  This is not simply about Bernie Sanders, just like 2012 wasn't about how the Republicans defrauded Ron Paul.
[00:45:19.242 --> 00:45:21.904]  Ultimately, it's about the system itself.
[00:45:22.384 --> 00:45:23.625]  Are we going to have a corrupt system?
[00:45:24.306 --> 00:45:32.091]  It looks like the delegates here and the Democrat convention are fine with keeping the superdelegate system that was so rigged.
[00:45:32.151 --> 00:45:35.574]  Remember, she started out with 15% of the votes that she needed to win.
[00:45:36.414 --> 00:45:45.064]  And then you, another way of looking at that is that if you go state by state, in every one of the states, she had about 10 to 15 percent of the delegates as superdelegates already on her side.
[00:45:45.724 --> 00:45:53.032]  Each of those states were proportionately allocated, so that meant that for Bernie to even break even on delegates, he had to beat her by 10 to 15 percent.
[00:45:54.474 --> 00:45:58.696]  And he couldn't get ahead of her unless he got ahead of that 10 or 15 percent threshold.
[00:45:58.976 --> 00:45:59.996]  That's what we continually saw.
[00:46:00.036 --> 00:46:10.780]  That's why state by state you would look at it and say, wait a minute, he beat her by a pretty good margin here, 7, 8, 10 percent, but she got the same number of delegates or more in most cases of the states where he won.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.481]  They do not want to change that system.
[00:46:14.441 --> 00:46:19.063]  As they have deposed Debbie Wasserman Schultz, or as we call her, Debbie Wasserman Schill.
[00:46:19.524 --> 00:46:20.604]  They've moved her out.
[00:46:20.624 --> 00:46:22.365]  First it was just going to be she wasn't going to speak.
[00:46:22.765 --> 00:46:25.047]  Then they said she's going to be resigning altogether.
[00:46:25.067 --> 00:46:28.628]  But now they're talking about the fact she's going to open the convention and close the convention.
[00:46:28.668 --> 00:46:32.210]  So we'll have to see what's going to happen with that and see what the crowd reaction is to it.
[00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:35.032]  And of course, as we pointed out, we were on with Alex Jones earlier.
[00:46:36.058 --> 00:46:41.862]  The rebellion that they were expecting, that they tried to play up at the GOP, never really happened.
[00:46:41.882 --> 00:46:45.824]  But there truly is a grassroots rebellion outside the convention here.
[00:46:46.145 --> 00:46:50.327]  It remains to be seen if that's going to bleed on into the convention with the delegates.
[00:46:50.367 --> 00:46:54.770]  But based on the person that we talked to, it looks like that may very well be the case.
[00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:58.252]  And we'll be talking to a lot of them after the roll call vote, I'm sure.
[00:46:58.272 --> 00:47:00.414]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:47:02.973 --> 00:47:07.954]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[00:47:32.759 --> 00:47:35.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:35.301 --> 00:47:43.145]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:43.565 --> 00:47:48.328]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:48.448 --> 00:47:50.469]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:52.611]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:52.651 --> 00:48:00.575]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888.
[00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:08.201]  2-5-3 3-1-3-9 Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:15.686]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:48:16.306 --> 00:48:24.632]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:48:24.932 --> 00:48:28.955]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:48:29.275 --> 00:48:30.976]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:37.218]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity.
[00:48:52.304 --> 00:49:00.391]  The Hillary Clinton campaign, they really need those Bernie Sanders supporters to get on board if she's going to win the presidential race.
[00:49:00.411 --> 00:49:05.275]  President Lee Daughtry, the CEO of this convention, is now getting ready to speak.
[00:49:05.295 --> 00:49:06.836]  She's walking up to the microphone.
[00:49:20.748 --> 00:49:23.009]  Dave and I are from Infowars.com and we're talking to?
[00:49:23.409 --> 00:49:24.589]  Brian Ernst, Idaho.
[00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:27.530]  Alright, I see this, stop the TPP on here.
[00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:29.151]  Tell people why you're opposed to the TPP.
[00:49:29.931 --> 00:49:35.433]  I'm opposed to corporate sovereignty of 40% of the world's economy.
[00:49:35.953 --> 00:49:43.656]  I think that people and democratic processes should be able to regulate industry in ways for the public interest.
[00:49:43.976 --> 00:49:48.458]  And what TPP does is it removes government and democratic
[00:49:49.818 --> 00:49:55.340]  ...processes from the ability to regulate industry when it comes to globalized markets.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:58.041]  In a word, what it does is remove our sovereignty, right?
[00:49:58.301 --> 00:50:05.263]  What it does, it takes the governance of our economy out of our hands and hands it over to people, many of whom never maybe even been to our country, right?
[00:50:05.743 --> 00:50:14.666]  They haven't been to our country, they don't represent us, they represent corporate interests, and there are a lot of fundamental problems with TPP.
[00:50:16.914 --> 00:50:19.437]  So tell me, are you a delegate here at this convention?
[00:50:19.537 --> 00:50:23.921]  No, I'm a member of the Rules Committee, so I deliberated last Saturday.
[00:50:25.062 --> 00:50:31.148]  And how do you feel about the fact that Cain has been picked as a VP on this because he's supported all these trade deals?
[00:50:32.054 --> 00:50:35.856]  It's a kick in the teeth to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.
[00:50:36.596 --> 00:50:42.779]  Do you believe Hillary Clinton, when she said, you know, first she came out in support of these, then she said she was against them, then she picked Tim Kaine?
[00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:44.420]  Where do you think she stands on this?
[00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:54.185]  I have no doubt that Hillary Clinton, at the most, may rebrand TPP, but she, I believe she's in support of TPP.
[00:50:54.705 --> 00:50:55.065]  Absolutely.
[00:50:55.205 --> 00:51:05.934]  And of course it's not just TPP, of course we have the TTIP, and there's anything that's coming up down the road because of the Trade Promotion Authority, which Cain was an ardent supporter of, right?
[00:51:06.254 --> 00:51:07.415]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:51:08.175 --> 00:51:12.999]  Well thank you very much, but you're not a delegate, so, but thank you for talking to us.
[00:51:13.179 --> 00:51:13.960]  We made the rules.
[00:51:14.781 --> 00:51:18.083]  We tried to give them every avenue to get TPP back on the floor.
[00:51:19.404 --> 00:51:20.085]  They shut us down.
[00:51:20.749 --> 00:51:21.750]  I have another question for you.
[00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:23.270]  You're on the Rules Committee.
[00:51:23.791 --> 00:51:24.971]  What about the superdelegates?
[00:51:25.011 --> 00:51:26.312]  Did they do anything to change that?
[00:51:26.512 --> 00:51:28.073]  I saw that that was shut down as well.
[00:51:28.133 --> 00:51:29.334]  Any efforts to try to reform that?
[00:51:29.874 --> 00:51:31.275]  It was shut down several times.
[00:51:31.515 --> 00:51:33.136]  The committee was for the cameras.
[00:51:34.856 --> 00:51:37.378]  The decision was made before the committee even convened.
[00:51:38.218 --> 00:51:42.280]  And basically both campaigns made the decision, asked us to ratify the decision.
[00:51:43.681 --> 00:51:44.381]  It's a commission.
[00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:45.701]  It's unenforceable.
[00:51:46.542 --> 00:51:47.822]  It's an advisory commission.
[00:51:48.522 --> 00:51:55.543]  So basically it's going to ask the superdelegates to remove their own power eventually, sometime down the road.
[00:51:56.704 --> 00:52:02.785]  The Sanders campaign characterized it as having teeth and being substantive.
[00:52:04.505 --> 00:52:05.545]  The language says otherwise.
[00:52:06.546 --> 00:52:07.086]  Thank you very much.
[00:52:07.106 --> 00:52:07.466]  Appreciate it.
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.184]  David Knight, FrankfortWars.com, and of course you can see that the fix was in.
[00:52:12.224 --> 00:52:14.686]  As he pointed out, it was simply for the cameras.
[00:52:15.387 --> 00:52:17.909]  They had already decided what they were going to put in there.
[00:52:18.089 --> 00:52:21.172]  It was a show meeting for the Rules Committee.
[00:52:21.653 --> 00:52:22.593]  David Knight, FrankfortWars.com.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.201]  The globalists are scared.
[00:52:30.361 --> 00:52:31.862]  They've gone from being arrogant to scared.
[00:52:32.423 --> 00:52:33.704]  So now the battle is joined.
[00:52:34.324 --> 00:52:36.105]  They understand we have truth and justice on our side.
[00:52:36.686 --> 00:52:41.489]  Donald Trump didn't just come out last week and say, Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:46.373]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:52:46.833 --> 00:52:47.494]  America first.
[00:52:48.074 --> 00:52:50.716]  Coffin nails the New World Order and their worldwide tyranny.
[00:52:50.796 --> 00:52:51.317]  It's unelected.
[00:52:52.185 --> 00:52:56.069]  He's been talking about the era of American surrender being over.
[00:52:56.469 --> 00:53:00.513]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[00:53:01.333 --> 00:53:03.916]  And that's what Operation Sleeping Giant is.
[00:53:04.637 --> 00:53:08.740]  The era of surrender and servitude is over.
[00:53:09.341 --> 00:53:14.125]  America and the world, just like with the Brexit, is breaking its trance.
[00:53:14.546 --> 00:53:16.187]  This special report is key.
[00:53:16.387 --> 00:53:16.828]  Stay with us.
[00:53:17.915 --> 00:53:23.978]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[00:53:24.498 --> 00:53:27.319]  Mark your calendars because history is going to be made again.
[00:53:27.839 --> 00:53:32.441]  Coming up in just about four days, the 27th of July 2016.
[00:53:34.182 --> 00:53:35.323]  We only do it once a year.
[00:53:35.803 --> 00:53:42.686]  It's the 24-hour marathon broadcast with special guest Breaking News Analysis.
[00:53:44.094 --> 00:53:47.137]  Many documentaries that we've been producing and so much more.
[00:53:47.637 --> 00:53:50.079]  I'll be hosting for at least 10 hours of the 24 hours.
[00:53:50.359 --> 00:53:55.564]  We'll have other guests host in, people in studio, folks flying in, people skyping in.
[00:53:56.044 --> 00:53:56.885]  It's going to be amazing.
[00:53:56.945 --> 00:54:00.007]  We just covered the RNC and dominated coverage.
[00:54:00.047 --> 00:54:06.893]  Had the biggest victories in the info war we've ever had in my 21 year fight, in our 21 year fight together.
[00:54:08.169 --> 00:54:11.430]  Our team of 11 that was there absolutely dominated.
[00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:14.011]  We're going to have a team of seven on the ground.
[00:54:14.031 --> 00:54:17.412]  They're arriving today, this Saturday, on the ground in Philadelphia.
[00:54:17.692 --> 00:54:23.514]  We've got Hillary for prison, aircraft in the skies, rolling billboards, Hillary for prison, blaring the InfoWars broadcast.
[00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:27.296]  You'll see tens of thousands of people with Hillary for prison shirts.
[00:54:27.356 --> 00:54:29.336]  It's all grassroots on the street.
[00:54:30.016 --> 00:54:35.698]  You just heard Donald Trump come out and say, we are about Americanism, not globalism.
[00:54:35.738 --> 00:54:36.719]  That will be our credo.
[00:54:37.739 --> 00:54:38.900]  The New World Order is panicking.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:39.981]  They've had the New Republic.
[00:54:40.001 --> 00:54:41.122]  They've had the New York Times.
[00:54:41.462 --> 00:54:42.483]  They've had the LA Times.
[00:54:42.523 --> 00:54:48.047]  They've had hundreds of publications come out and say, oh my God, the world government's in trouble.
[00:54:48.187 --> 00:54:50.488]  Alex Jones has infected the Republican Party.
[00:54:51.169 --> 00:54:52.670]  Well, you're the infection.
[00:54:52.850 --> 00:54:53.651]  We're the cure.
[00:54:53.991 --> 00:54:56.413]  We want lower taxes, national sovereignty.
[00:54:56.593 --> 00:55:03.698]  We don't want big foreign TPP and EU systems controlling our regulations and overruling our federal and state governments.
[00:55:04.058 --> 00:55:04.979]  That's common sense.
[00:55:05.399 --> 00:55:06.120]  And your reign
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.063]  of disinformation and war on reality is coming to an end.
[00:55:11.463 --> 00:55:12.704]  I ran into the Young Turks.
[00:55:12.764 --> 00:55:13.804]  I ran into Charlie Rose.
[00:55:14.185 --> 00:55:19.668]  I ran into a bunch of globals and their operatives, and they were completely and totally freaked out.
[00:55:20.149 --> 00:55:21.089]  They were desperate.
[00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:22.190]  They were scared.
[00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:28.574]  Even mainstream media admits Infowars is leading the global narrative, the tip of the spear.
[00:55:28.614 --> 00:55:32.176]  And as I've always said, folks, you are that tip of the spear.
[00:55:32.657 --> 00:55:34.258]  So mark your calendars.
[00:55:34.918 --> 00:55:36.099]  Spread this on Facebook.
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:37.901]  Get this out to everybody you know.
[00:55:38.461 --> 00:55:49.672]  Because we've been so busy battling and covering so many stories with our small team that's so incredibly effective that I haven't even started promoting our once-a-year 24-hour-plus broadcast.
[00:55:49.712 --> 00:55:54.657]  It usually goes about 30 hours or until we get too exhausted or until the equipment starts malfunctioning because it's so hot.
[00:55:54.957 --> 00:55:57.159]  We've almost got smoke coming out of here.
[00:55:57.179 --> 00:55:59.561]  I mean, that's how hard we're fighting the globalists.
[00:56:00.443 --> 00:56:05.825]  This one is going to be even more special because we're going to have crew on the ground during Hitler's coronation.
[00:56:06.954 --> 00:56:11.735]  We're dubbing it Operation Awaken the Sleeping Giant, or Operation Sleeping Giant for short.
[00:56:12.155 --> 00:56:19.937]  InfoWars.com forward slash giant to find the free video feeds, the audio feeds, the podcast, the info and more.
[00:56:20.057 --> 00:56:21.558]  And yes, the globalists hate this.
[00:56:22.218 --> 00:56:33.421]  We're fundraising, not with New World Order sponsorship, but selling Hillary for President shirts and good old fashioned free speech and super high quality nutraceuticals that are going to be discounted massively.
[00:56:33.761 --> 00:56:36.343]  So start your engines, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:36.763 --> 00:56:37.404]  Get ready.
[00:56:37.944 --> 00:56:40.906]  We're not going to defeat the New World Order with this one broadcast.
[00:56:41.567 --> 00:56:43.008]  It's just one more arrow.
[00:56:44.428 --> 00:56:48.269]  But together with this bow, and with our resistance, we are going to beat them.
[00:56:48.849 --> 00:56:50.569]  This is just one more punch in the fight.
[00:56:50.649 --> 00:56:51.330]  Twelve rounds.
[00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:54.910]  We're like nine rounds in, and they have been on the mat repeatedly.
[00:56:55.290 --> 00:57:00.052]  We have the initiative, and as long as we focus and commit, we're not going to lose.
[00:57:00.212 --> 00:57:01.632]  And the stakes are too high.
[00:57:02.092 --> 00:57:04.933]  World planetary unelected anti-human government.
[00:57:05.193 --> 00:57:07.673]  They've tried to deny it, but everybody knows it's happening.
[00:57:07.693 --> 00:57:08.694]  World government's out in the open.
[00:57:08.714 --> 00:57:09.374]  Look at the Brexit.
[00:57:09.554 --> 00:57:10.374]  Look at just what happened.
[00:57:11.664 --> 00:57:15.267]  You haven't gotten involved in the Liberty Movement, it's time to get informed and get involved.
[00:57:15.567 --> 00:57:29.838]  But to all of you that have been the tip of the spear, that are just as important as I am, or Anthony Gucciardi coming in on a Saturday to shoot this video, you have to understand, you are the heart, you are the blood, you are the guts, you are the brains, you are the skin, you are the bone, you are the whole nine yards, you are the info war.
[00:57:30.018 --> 00:57:33.641]  So I want to salute you, and I want to salute everyone that came out.
[00:57:34.381 --> 00:57:38.664]  To that event and those events in Cleveland, it was history making.
[00:57:39.064 --> 00:57:42.626]  We're going to make history again with our team on the ground in Philadelphia at the DNC.
[00:57:42.906 --> 00:57:53.833]  We're going to make history here together in Austin, Texas, and wherever you are, from Japan to Russia, from Mexico to Chile to Canada, to the United States to Germany, to Saudi Arabia, to Israel, to South Africa, to Nigeria.
[00:57:55.018 --> 00:58:00.702]  Our information, our analysis took over the floor of the RNC chanting Hillary for prison.
[00:58:01.022 --> 00:58:04.004]  Trump is battling the new world order and speaking out against the globalists.
[00:58:04.384 --> 00:58:06.786]  Trump is admitting that Hillary is a communist Chinese agent.
[00:58:07.447 --> 00:58:09.168]  Our information is spreading like wildfire.
[00:58:09.188 --> 00:58:11.629]  The police and military are almost completely awake.
[00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:14.231]  The globalists are trying to start a civil war.
[00:58:14.711 --> 00:58:21.056]  It's time for Americans and others that love freedom to kick it into high gear and counter these criminal operations.
[00:58:21.536 --> 00:58:27.961]  And I'm here to tell you, Operation Sleeping Giant is the most important phase yet in this fight.
[00:58:28.262 --> 00:58:33.566]  As I've said many times, I don't know how this is gonna end, but if you wanna fight, you got one!
[00:58:33.826 --> 00:58:35.147]  Well, that's it for our show tonight.
[00:58:35.187 --> 00:58:38.870]  We do encourage you to go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get yourself a free trial.

[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.395 --> 00:59:20.087]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.427 --> 00:59:24.170]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.731 --> 00:59:29.395]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.795 --> 00:59:36.020]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
