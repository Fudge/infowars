[00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:22.097]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.137 --> 00:00:25.939]  It is Friday, December 16th, 2016 and I'm Leigh Ann McAdoo.
[00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:26.980]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.903 --> 00:00:35.045]  Facebook is stepping up its push to censor fake news.
[00:00:35.546 --> 00:00:38.368]  And now George Soros is helping to finance it.
[00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.513]  Plus, Tucker Carlson taking on the frauds in the liberal media head-on every day.
[00:00:44.993 --> 00:00:46.034]  When will they learn?
[00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:49.056]  Let me answer the question.
[00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:51.418]  You're not letting me answer the question.
[00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:53.519]  I am trying to answer the question.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.640]  This is a little nutty.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.482]  Look how much time we are wasting.
[00:00:56.602 --> 00:01:03.707]  Meanwhile, the story continues to rage that Russia influenced our election and is responsible for the WikiLeaks.
[00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:06.029]  Julian Assange says differently.
[00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.412]  And then... Who are the faithless electors?
[00:01:10.753 --> 00:01:11.533]  Do they exist?
[00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:14.516]  Will the push for faithless electors be successful?
[00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:21.221]  All this and more as Barack Obama flies to Hawaii for vacation on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.347 --> 00:01:36.952]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:44.718]  We're making freedom go viral, and now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:01.596 --> 00:03:13.778]  Well, by now, everyone out there has heard about this new agenda to curtail the fake news, whatever the establishment deems to be non-important or, of course, counter to whatever agenda it's trying to push.
[00:03:14.258 --> 00:03:17.939]  Well, lo and behold, George Soros once again rears his ugly head.
[00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:25.160]  So we've heard now that Facebook is going to be helping to determine what stories are disputed.
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.721]  They're partnering up with an organization known as the Poynter Institute.
[00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:33.343]  Well, Poynter Institute, they have this international fact-checking network.
[00:03:33.543 --> 00:03:38.045]  It is openly funded by the Soros Open Society Foundation.
[00:03:38.566 --> 00:03:42.327]  So, I'm sure that there isn't going to be any internal bias there.
[00:03:42.948 --> 00:03:50.011]  Now, Facebook says that if the fact-checking organizations determine that a certain story is fake, it will get flagged and disputed.
[00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:55.334]  And according to this Facebook announcement, there's going to be a link to the corresponding article explaining why.
[00:03:55.914 --> 00:04:00.996]  Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in the news feed, so that means they're never going to be trending.
[00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:11.280]  Now, this article points out that this third-party organization, the International Fact-Checking Network, is hosted by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:21.744]  Now, this is funded by Soros' Open Society Foundations, as well as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, and the National Endowment for Democracy.
[00:04:22.004 --> 00:04:24.705]  The Poynter Institute is also an online college!
[00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:27.145]  It has six employees.
[00:04:27.565 --> 00:04:28.906]  It's kind of a diploma mill.
[00:04:29.406 --> 00:04:40.508]  And there was a story out of ABC that the Poynter Institute was actually there covering the rollout of Obamacare and they would not give fair use time to Republicans.
[00:04:40.568 --> 00:04:45.589]  The Republicans said, well, we'll pay you to get some fair time and they would not allow it.
[00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:52.131]  So I'm sure we're going to be seeing a lot of the same type of bias with this new fact-checking algorithm and these
[00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:54.872]  You know, these six employees.
[00:04:54.892 --> 00:04:59.255]  I mean, at least it's not the two employees that are running Snopes, the lady and her husband with their cats.
[00:04:59.635 --> 00:05:00.535]  They are running Snopes.
[00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:03.717]  This is who is in charge now of the fact-checking that's out there.
[00:05:03.757 --> 00:05:05.678]  But this is why this is happening.
[00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:10.401]  Because the media knows that they are increasingly becoming non-important.
[00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:15.364]  And Julian Assange said just that in a radio interview that he gave with Sean Hannity.
[00:05:15.844 --> 00:05:16.765]  This was Thursday.
[00:05:17.205 --> 00:05:18.166]  He blasted U.S.
[00:05:18.206 --> 00:05:18.907]  media outlets.
[00:05:19.107 --> 00:05:23.311]  He said that the power possessed by journalists had greatly diminished in recent years.
[00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:26.534]  They are increasingly not very important.
[00:05:27.334 --> 00:05:29.176]  And of course, Sean Hannity agreed.
[00:05:29.376 --> 00:05:30.777]  He said, so true, so true.
[00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:38.444]  And that's what I like about the guy because, you know, any other media pundit or they would, you know, host, they would consider themselves to just be indisposable.
[00:05:38.624 --> 00:05:39.585]  But he was like, it's true.
[00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:40.306]  It's true.
[00:05:40.366 --> 00:05:41.767]  The media has greatly
[00:05:42.768 --> 00:05:43.129]  We're good to go.
[00:06:02.731 --> 00:06:08.513]  He said readers see it, they feel it, they don't like being lectured or told what to do, and they rebel against it.
[00:06:08.593 --> 00:06:10.334]  And that is absolutely the truth.
[00:06:10.734 --> 00:06:18.037]  People can smell when something's not right, they can smell when people are trying to sell them a fishy story, and people are pushing back against that.
[00:06:18.057 --> 00:06:20.978]  And they want information from alternative channels, so it'll be interesting to see
[00:06:21.658 --> 00:06:22.058]  What's going on?
[00:06:40.186 --> 00:06:43.388]  And this is Newsweek's senior editor, this guy.
[00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:56.757]  In September, he tweeted out a conspiracy theory that he believed Donald Trump was institutionalized in a mental hospital for a nervous breakdown in the 90s, which is why he won't release his medical records.
[00:06:57.077 --> 00:07:02.721]  Now, he promptly deleted this tweet, but obviously, you know, people save bold statements like that.
[00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:08.625]  So he was on Tucker Carlson Tonight, where Tucker Carlson was like, OK, man, you're saying this.
[00:07:08.685 --> 00:07:09.706]  It seems kind of crazy.
[00:07:11.226 --> 00:07:12.667]  Why would you say something like this?
[00:07:12.767 --> 00:07:13.567]  Give us some proof.
[00:07:13.627 --> 00:07:14.488]  Give us the story.
[00:07:14.548 --> 00:07:15.268]  Who told you this?
[00:07:15.688 --> 00:07:33.915]  And he just goes into this long diatribe about all of his CIA buddies who are sitting on the couch with him and he keeps pulling up this folder that's showcasing a binder with the label Tucker Carlson's falsehoods and so he's trying to bring up the CIA and all these fallen agents and Tucker Carlson's like, whoa this is
[00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:34.996]  Loony.
[00:07:35.456 --> 00:07:37.798]  You understand you're coming off as totally loony right now.
[00:07:37.838 --> 00:07:39.139]  It's a little nutty, I gotta be honest.
[00:07:39.239 --> 00:07:41.341]  It was the most bizarre exchange.
[00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:42.302]  You've gotta check it out.
[00:07:42.342 --> 00:07:44.103]  It's up on our article.
[00:07:44.543 --> 00:07:47.686]  It's up at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:47.726 --> 00:07:48.847]  But I've met Tucker Carlson.
[00:07:48.887 --> 00:07:50.248]  He's actually a really great person.
[00:07:50.308 --> 00:07:54.011]  Someone you meet in person, he's just like his on-air personality.
[00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:58.115]  Just like when he busted out laughing when that Clinton rape protester was
[00:07:58.775 --> 00:08:02.776]  Bombarded the set there that day and he just busted out laughing at me because that's how he is.
[00:08:02.796 --> 00:08:20.541]  He's authentic He's a good guy, you know, unless it's a great actor, you know, he's a really good and so this is you know I feel like these authentic media personalities are starting to really rise up to the top now that people like Megyn Kelly They're starting to show their true colors and their bias people aren't buying it anymore.
[00:08:20.621 --> 00:08:26.743]  Just like they're not buying Megyn Kelly's book Now the New York Times of course is coming out claiming that Trump
[00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:28.823]  Is a threat to democracy.
[00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:32.544]  Not the biased news, not the fake news that's been pushing a certain agenda.
[00:08:33.264 --> 00:08:37.865]  But this is the mainstream media laying the groundwork to justify the overthrow of Trump.
[00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:43.587]  They're trying to delegitimize him in the mind of the American voter before he even gets in.
[00:08:44.307 --> 00:08:53.009]  So again, Clifford Cunningham of Infowars.com points out how the New York Times is owned by anti-Trump billionaire Carlos Slim.
[00:08:53.189 --> 00:08:54.589]  So they're right there.
[00:08:54.609 --> 00:08:56.570]  They're going to have an editorial slant.
[00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:05.492]  But the New York Times is advising Americans to remain vigilant because President-elect Donald Trump is a threat to our democratic system.
[00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:22.535]  And they go on to say that he has these authoritarian indicators, anti-democratic tendencies, including a failure to reject violence unambiguously, a readiness to curtail rivals' civil liberties, and the denial of the legitimacy of elected governments.
[00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:24.215]  And they're using as an example
[00:09:24.915 --> 00:09:28.579]  In the campaign, he encouraged violence among supporters.
[00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:32.202]  He pledged to prosecute Hillary Clinton, since no one else will.
[00:09:32.723 --> 00:09:38.768]  He threatened legal action against unfriendly media and suggested that he might not accept the election results.
[00:09:40.061 --> 00:09:57.345]  All of this written without any irony of the fact that it was actually Hillary Clinton supporters who were getting violent at rallies, and the fact that Hillary Clinton needs to be prosecuted, yet she's been so protected by the Obama administration that no one is coming after her.
[00:09:58.125 --> 00:10:01.286]  And then, of course, suggesting that he might not accept the election results.
[00:10:01.366 --> 00:10:03.486]  Well, I think we can all see how that turned out.
[00:10:03.526 --> 00:10:05.887]  Hillary Clinton and her supporters are being totally
[00:10:06.887 --> 00:10:08.689]  Crazy wingnuts!
[00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:15.738]  And of course they also did not point out the fact that Obama himself had unprecedented use of executive actions.
[00:10:15.778 --> 00:10:17.981]  People were calling him the dictator in charge.
[00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:22.486]  He tried to railroad his agenda through Congress with the help of
[00:10:23.527 --> 00:10:34.360]  Then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who did all sorts of procedural changes, and there was absolutely no input or pushback by Republicans in Congress.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.121]  It just wasn't allowed.
[00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:35.701]  But that's fine.
[00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:36.703]  He wasn't a dictator.
[00:10:36.863 --> 00:10:37.924]  He was a great, great man.
[00:10:37.964 --> 00:10:40.967]  I'm sure Obama's legacy will live on in infamy.
[00:10:41.528 --> 00:10:47.454]  But the real threat to our democracy, of course, are these defector electors, okay?
[00:10:47.534 --> 00:10:54.180]  These feckless electors who are saying that they aren't going to uphold their oath and vote the way they're supposed to.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:11:01.306]  So now a Republican elector has come out slamming this coup d'etat attempt to overturn a fair and legal election.
[00:11:01.547 --> 00:11:02.588]  This is Alan Braun.
[00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:04.730]  He's a Republican elector from Des Moines, Iowa.
[00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.931]  And he blasted this move as a partisan ploy and refused to be affected by it.
[00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:15.973]  He said, what the Hamilton electors are suggesting amounts to a coup d'etat to overturn a fair and legal election.
[00:11:16.353 --> 00:11:18.274]  I refuse to cooperate with them.
[00:11:18.894 --> 00:11:20.295]  And he is just going on.
[00:11:20.335 --> 00:11:27.737]  He's kind of keeping a tally on his Twitter roll about how many pages, letters he's getting every single day.
[00:11:27.797 --> 00:11:29.317]  He's getting FedEx packages.
[00:11:29.357 --> 00:11:30.538]  He's getting phone calls.
[00:11:31.318 --> 00:11:34.380]  One day he got 58 letters, another day he got 96 letters.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.842]  Again, these are those Saul Alinsky tactics we keep telling you all about.
[00:11:38.122 --> 00:11:49.408]  They've got their Saul Alinsky tactics to just bombard people with letters, information, demand they respond, demand they boycott Breitbart, you know, don't sell your advertising on Breitbart.
[00:11:49.488 --> 00:11:50.229]  They bombard
[00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:50.969]  I think so.
[00:12:05.976 --> 00:12:08.138]  The Russians interfering with the election.
[00:12:36.196 --> 00:12:50.168]  I'll get to him in just a minute, but a Michigan elector came out and said this was in response to that video that all the Hollywood celebrities came out once again lecturing the American people on how they need to vote and how they need to think.
[00:12:50.649 --> 00:12:52.010]  Well, this is a Michigan elector.
[00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:52.610]  He came out
[00:12:53.251 --> 00:12:58.734]  Um, saying, I'm sorry, but anti-Trump celebrities are not smarter than the American people.
[00:12:58.875 --> 00:13:01.856]  I don't care what it is that you guys have to say.
[00:13:01.876 --> 00:13:05.579]  You're not, you know, I don't care how many celebrities think that they are smarter.
[00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:09.101]  They're not smarter than the American people or the people of Michigan.
[00:13:09.201 --> 00:13:14.545]  And it's like, hallelujah, finally time for these Hollywood celebrities to lose their power.
[00:13:15.365 --> 00:13:21.549]  Here's one celebrity who still kind of has his head on straight, I guess, Arnold Schwarzenegger, calling on Americans to stop whining.
[00:13:21.709 --> 00:13:25.991]  He says, when someone is elected, you get 100 percent behind them and you help them.
[00:13:26.632 --> 00:13:32.635]  Of course, he is also going to be the new host of Celebrity Apprentice, so he knows what side his bread is buttered on.
[00:13:32.735 --> 00:13:35.557]  But still, you know, they're not all absolutely crazy.
[00:13:36.057 --> 00:13:40.620]  So now getting back to this Texas elector, he kind of first came out famously cited
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.821]  That, you know, said that he wasn't going to be voting for Donald Trump.
[00:13:43.881 --> 00:13:47.983]  He wasn't going to vote for Hillary either, but he was just going to choose a Republican of his liking.
[00:13:48.763 --> 00:14:06.211]  Well, not only did this guy create a 9-11 charity fund and then he used that 9-11 email address to sign up for an Ashley Madison account to cheat on his wife with his three kids, but apparently he lied about being a 9-11 first responder for
[00:14:08.752 --> 00:14:16.435]  So this is Chris Suprin and he said that he responded with the Manassas Park, Virginia Fire Department after the third plane hit the Pentagon.
[00:14:17.776 --> 00:14:24.719]  But an investigation revealed that the department he was among wasn't even amongst those who were responding to the attacks.
[00:14:25.039 --> 00:14:27.900]  And he didn't even join the fire department until October 2001.
[00:14:29.961 --> 00:14:32.342]  A whole month after these attacks.
[00:14:32.382 --> 00:14:40.504]  So this is probably why this guy, Chris Supperin, had to hire a PR agency to handle his wild claims.
[00:14:41.504 --> 00:14:43.125]  Everyone was thinking, who is this guy?
[00:14:43.165 --> 00:14:45.645]  Why does he have a PR agency helping him out?
[00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:54.128]  It's because he's going to have a ton of negative press now that people realize he's set up this whole 9-11 charity and I wonder what he did with that money.
[00:14:54.288 --> 00:14:55.628]  He wasn't even a first responder.
[00:14:55.648 --> 00:14:56.609]  He's a total fraud.
[00:14:58.169 --> 00:15:01.631]  I don't know who elected him to be our elector, but he needs to be out.
[00:15:02.291 --> 00:15:06.033]  Now, I want to shift gears here to a story out of Germany.
[00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:10.635]  We had a 12-year-old try to blow up a German Christmas market.
[00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:14.617]  Now, this was a 12-year-old Germany Rocky boy.
[00:15:14.637 --> 00:15:21.081]  He tried to detonate a bomb at a Christmas market in Germany, and this was last month.
[00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:25.143]  He planted another explosive device near the town hall a couple of days later.
[00:15:25.823 --> 00:15:26.443]  I think so.
[00:15:45.865 --> 00:15:51.046]  Nobody knows how was he radicalized, but here in Germany he's below the age of criminal responsibility.
[00:15:51.386 --> 00:15:57.908]  So this is why ISIS goes after these young targets, because they fly under the radar and they're going to get less severe forms of punishment.
[00:15:58.288 --> 00:16:05.810]  And this is another reason why we are having, you know, issues with bringing refugees, bringing people we can't vet into this country.
[00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:13.332]  Now Margaret Howell has more on some congressmen that are urging Trump to follow through with this Muslim surveillance program.
[00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:14.981]  Well, that's right, Leigh-Anne.
[00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:19.583]  So as you mentioned, there's a major problem going on with Islamic extremism, Islamic terrorism.
[00:16:20.083 --> 00:16:29.346]  And we heard Trump run on the promise that he would put a moratorium on anyone entering the country from a war-torn Muslim area that could potentially be radicalized.
[00:16:29.386 --> 00:16:37.609]  Now, we know the president's true legacy, President Obama, his true legacy is one that in the past eight years, it's consisted of more terrorist attacks on U.S.
[00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:41.370]  soil than at any other time, individual attacks in U.S.
[00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:41.670]  history.
[00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.411]  We have this representative, his name is Peter King.
[00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:48.854]  He said that he met with Donald Trump this week and he said that he's encouraging him.
[00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:51.796]  He goes, look, now's not the time to be politically correct here.
[00:16:51.876 --> 00:16:54.137]  We need to maintain this list that you promised.
[00:16:54.497 --> 00:16:56.178]  You know, he and Trump did do this.
[00:16:56.218 --> 00:17:05.343]  He actually promised that we would be keeping track of people that perhaps are not vetted, that are entering the country in an effort to prevent Islam extremism.
[00:17:05.904 --> 00:17:07.585]  One like the case you just mentioned in Germany.
[00:17:08.485 --> 00:17:12.228]  Now, we know that there was a case coming out, and it's cited in this article.
[00:17:12.248 --> 00:17:14.509]  And this is your article, by the way, that I'm using here.
[00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:19.472]  Leanne found this, and I'm like, we have to talk about this tonight because it is an important issue.
[00:17:19.933 --> 00:17:22.374]  This list, it's very controversial.
[00:17:22.394 --> 00:17:24.596]  It has a lot of civil liberties groups up in arms.
[00:17:25.016 --> 00:17:32.801]  We know that one city commissioner in New York City, for five straight years, he had ordered the city police to monitor mosques secretly.
[00:17:33.181 --> 00:17:35.243]  They found out about it because of the Associated Press.
[00:17:35.683 --> 00:17:41.667]  They sued effectively, so we know the rabbit hole that something like this can create and spark.
[00:17:41.948 --> 00:17:45.030]  And nobody is a fan of being on lists, frankly.
[00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.812]  You know, we as political free speech advocates, we're probably on a list somewhere.
[00:17:48.852 --> 00:17:50.073]  Let me just say that right now.
[00:17:50.413 --> 00:17:52.915]  But at the same time, Trump did make these promises.
[00:17:52.975 --> 00:17:56.218]  Now, this goes hand in hand with something that the House is trying to do.
[00:17:56.238 --> 00:18:02.402]  The House is passing this microchipping law that's intended to help authorities microchip disabled people.
[00:18:02.702 --> 00:18:03.863]  Sounds like a great idea, right?
[00:18:03.903 --> 00:18:05.484]  You've got this runaway granny.
[00:18:05.784 --> 00:18:06.765]  She doesn't know who she is.
[00:18:06.805 --> 00:18:08.907]  She just wants to go down the street to the store.
[00:18:08.927 --> 00:18:09.607]  She can't remember where she is.
[00:18:09.627 --> 00:18:10.108]  She gets lost.
[00:18:10.428 --> 00:18:11.809]  We hear cases like this all the time.
[00:18:11.829 --> 00:18:13.150]  They're called silver alerts.
[00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:18.855]  Now, the House, they're passing this bill that would get the federal government heavily involved
[00:18:19.435 --> 00:18:20.955]  And microchipping disabled people.
[00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:27.337]  My guess is, and it doesn't go into it, that this would be a responsibility for Medicare or Medicaid to pay for this.
[00:18:27.437 --> 00:18:28.898]  It seems like some kind of scheme to me.
[00:18:28.938 --> 00:18:30.978]  It's called HR 4919.
[00:18:31.518 --> 00:18:34.519]  And this bill is also known as Kevin and Avante's Law.
[00:18:34.539 --> 00:18:38.260]  The idea behind it is that disabled people, they can't take care of themselves.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.981]  We've got too many silver alerts.
[00:18:40.041 --> 00:18:43.722]  But we know that microchipping isn't all that effective.
[00:18:44.162 --> 00:18:45.542]  Also a case that you brought up.
[00:18:45.823 --> 00:18:51.744]  We've got a sex offender here who was dubbed Jaws for his predatory attacks coming out of California.
[00:18:52.045 --> 00:18:58.987]  He was wearing one of these ankle bracelets along with his sex offender friends and yet he was still able to rape and murder four women.
[00:19:01.968 --> 00:19:02.808]  Three years ago
[00:19:03.752 --> 00:19:16.407]  The Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act repealed the law that had been on the books for decades, barring the CIA and other agencies from engaging in domestic propaganda and disinformation.
[00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:36.358]  Over the weekend, they passed the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act that funds 160 plus million dollars to this new organization that will, quote, discover and counter with its own disinformation, alternative media that they dub fake news.
[00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:52.010]  At the very same time, we see mainstream media claiming that Trump, myself, Tucker Carlson, you name it, are Russian agents, and that the American people really wanted Hillary Clinton, but the Russians somehow hacked in, and that's why Trump won.
[00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:56.173]  Yes, we've gotten Trump elected, but they're openly trying to overthrow that.
[00:19:57.034 --> 00:20:00.379]  Now more than ever, InfoWars needs your prayers and your support.
[00:20:00.439 --> 00:20:06.106]  And I need you to take the articles and the videos that are on the site and realize you're the reason we're having such an effect.

[00:20:13.869 --> 00:20:22.471]  As we approach Christmas, and I'm supposed to say that word now, our country's under such incredible thought police tyranny, it's important to be thankful.
[00:20:22.612 --> 00:20:34.215]  And I am extremely thankful to all of you that have prayed for us, that have spread the word about the broadcast, that have supported us, that have defended us, and that have financially supported us.

[00:23:11.684 --> 00:23:26.537]  He's one of the top gun instructors in Texas and a good friend of mine, Michael Cargill, and he's trained tens of thousands of people to get their CHLs and defend themselves in case there's a home invasion or somebody tries to mug them or I guess carjack you.
[00:23:26.998 --> 00:23:37.868]  But you would never think that it would be his parents, namely his dad, that made national news from NRA news to Fox News, you name it, when he killed a home intruder.
[00:23:38.328 --> 00:23:42.510]  Early Friday morning around four, an unwanted guest tried to break into this house.
[00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:50.334]  Back here in Austin, gun rights advocate and owner of Central Texas Gun Works, Michael Cargill, says his mom and stepdad live there.
[00:23:50.814 --> 00:23:52.034]  Bad news for the intruder.
[00:23:52.154 --> 00:23:57.017]  My mother gave me a call and she was crying on the phone and that really scared me.
[00:23:57.617 --> 00:23:59.238]  And I said, what's wrong?
[00:23:59.278 --> 00:23:59.858]  What's going on?
[00:24:00.198 --> 00:24:03.860]  And she said, someone broke into the house and your dad had to stop them.
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.361]  And so, oh, my heart stopped.
[00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:10.403]  Cargill made sure they had called 911 and then gave them his expert advice.
[00:24:10.663 --> 00:24:14.746]  I don't want them making any statements at all and saying the wrong thing and getting themselves in trouble.
[00:24:14.986 --> 00:24:19.288]  Cargill started working on getting an attorney and then realized how big of a deal it was in Georgia.
[00:24:19.528 --> 00:24:24.771]  I opened up my phone to Twitter, and my goodness, it was like there were three news stations outside my parents' house.
[00:24:24.811 --> 00:24:29.094]  According to Gwinnett County Police, the intruder used a ladder to get to the second story window.
[00:24:29.354 --> 00:24:37.900]  Husband retrieved his firearm, went to investigate the sounds, and when he walked into the master bathroom of the home, found a male climbing through the window.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.041]  The husband fired one shot.
[00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:42.262]  That one shot struck the guy in the face.
[00:24:42.623 --> 00:24:43.343]  He didn't survive.
[00:24:43.703 --> 00:24:47.826]  They are well within their rights of using deadly force to protect their home.
[00:24:48.166 --> 00:24:52.811]  They're really broken up by this, you know, having to, you know, stop someone and take someone's life.
[00:24:53.552 --> 00:24:55.013]  It's very, it changes you.
[00:24:55.634 --> 00:25:01.860]  None of us want to be confronted with somebody that's breaking into our house and could be threatening us with bodily harm.
[00:25:02.521 --> 00:25:06.705]  But it is the Second Amendment in areas that have the Second Amendment in place that have lower crime rates.
[00:25:07.125 --> 00:25:11.550]  But unfortunately, with some of the economic problems we've had lately, we've seen crime start to go back up.
[00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.993]  It's gone down since the 1990s, one of the lowest levels ever.
[00:25:15.053 --> 00:25:18.516]  But I tell you, it is the Second Amendment that is that great equalizer.
[00:25:18.537 --> 00:25:23.201]  I've got to tell you, Michael, you train for this constantly.
[00:25:23.441 --> 00:25:24.502]  Your parents are trained for it.
[00:25:24.823 --> 00:25:27.646]  Did you ever think that it would be your family that actually had to deal with this?
[00:25:28.311 --> 00:25:29.172]  No, not really at all.
[00:25:29.552 --> 00:25:34.636]  And what I do is I make sure that my parents actually come to me and we practice at the range.
[00:25:34.676 --> 00:25:35.757]  I make sure they're proficient.
[00:25:36.297 --> 00:25:39.280]  And I actually have kicked my mother off the range before.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.542]  That's just how strict I am.
[00:25:42.362 --> 00:25:45.044]  I made her go sit in the car because I didn't think she was ready.
[00:25:45.305 --> 00:25:49.668]  Well, we're going to go shooting today, so I'm finally getting my CHL.
[00:25:50.309 --> 00:25:52.490]  And I took the test this week with you, but now we're about to qualify.
[00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:53.151]  Absolutely.
[00:25:53.191 --> 00:25:54.092]  So we're going to go to the range.
[00:25:54.112 --> 00:25:54.852]  We're going to qualify.
[00:25:54.872 --> 00:25:56.554]  I got to say, though, your dad, one shot.
[00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:01.412]  Yes, one shot right in the face and stopped him, dropped him on the roof right there.
[00:26:02.073 --> 00:26:03.273]  Coming through the bathroom window.
[00:26:03.413 --> 00:26:06.575]  Coming through the master bathroom window at 3 o'clock in the morning.
[00:26:07.142 --> 00:26:09.963]  And you're talking something that took about 15 seconds.
[00:26:10.483 --> 00:26:11.923]  You wake up in the dead of the night.
[00:26:12.823 --> 00:26:13.723]  You hear that noise.
[00:26:13.743 --> 00:26:14.343]  You look around.
[00:26:14.384 --> 00:26:16.644]  You're checking to see that everyone's in their place.
[00:26:17.064 --> 00:26:19.665]  And then you realize, OK, everyone's in where they're supposed to be.
[00:26:20.065 --> 00:26:28.806]  So then he went into the master bathroom, grabbed, you know, grabbed his gun and saw this guy coming through the window, saw the light and one single shot stopped him.
[00:26:29.307 --> 00:26:30.607]  I guess your dad heard him breaking in.
[00:26:30.967 --> 00:26:31.287]  Yeah.
[00:26:31.307 --> 00:26:36.108]  He heard the noise and everything and figured on the second floor of the home, you know, who does that?
[00:26:36.608 --> 00:26:40.033]  You know, who breaks in through the master bathroom window on the second floor of the home?
[00:26:40.353 --> 00:26:42.636]  What are these crazy people thinking, breaking into somebody's house at night?
[00:26:42.976 --> 00:26:51.407]  Yeah, well, their goal was to, uh, the one guy was to break in inside the home, kill my parents, and then go downstairs and let the other guys inside the home.
[00:26:51.787 --> 00:26:58.154]  Well, now obviously we're taping this without any news tonight, so later we're going out and shooting, but we'll have some footage of this obviously.
[00:26:59.415 --> 00:27:04.720]  What got you into firearms training and then being one of the, you know, top CHL guys in Texas?
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.983]  I mean, you have so many folks go through your Central Texas Gun Works.
[00:27:08.604 --> 00:27:13.886]  Yeah, we, um, I had my grandmother who was 70 years old decided she was gonna go to college, get a college degree.
[00:27:14.367 --> 00:27:15.807]  She only had a high school education.
[00:27:16.167 --> 00:27:19.149]  So at 70, she decided she wanted to become a nurse, so she went to college.
[00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:25.792]  While she was traveling from a college library, sitting at a bus stop waiting for a bus to come, a guy came along, mugged her, and raped her.
[00:27:26.352 --> 00:27:31.575]  So I decided at that point I would make sure that every female and everyone in my family had the tools they needed to protect themselves.
[00:27:31.915 --> 00:27:34.657]  So that's why I became a licensed carry handgun instructor.
[00:27:34.977 --> 00:27:36.438]  That's why I opened a gun store.
[00:27:36.618 --> 00:27:39.900]  That's why I made sure that everyone in my family was proficient with firearms.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.341]  Because you just never know.
[00:27:42.213 --> 00:27:45.055]  Well, I know a lot of people have taken your course and they really like what you do.
[00:27:45.956 --> 00:27:56.524]  Looking at the so-called liberals, God love them, they really get mad when we talk about empowering women, because obviously they're smaller, not as strong on average, to be able to equalize things and protect themselves.
[00:27:56.564 --> 00:28:04.371]  But, I mean, it's just record numbers of women have defended themselves, driven off attackers, or killed them when they're trying to rape them.
[00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:09.275]  We've all heard the countless 911 calls where the guy's breaking through with a butcher knife and the little old lady takes him out.
[00:28:10.015 --> 00:28:16.856]  If you're really a feminist and want to empower women as a man or a woman, why wouldn't you want to get women out there and get trained?
[00:28:17.176 --> 00:28:29.578]  Exactly, because I think people, what they want to do, your anti-gun community people, your gun control individuals, what they want to do is they want to take that power away from the women so they can, you know, take advantage of them.
[00:28:29.899 --> 00:28:32.119]  And so, and you're right, that's just not the way to do it.
[00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:37.840]  You want to empower women so they can protect themselves, put the power in their own hands to defend themselves.
[00:28:38.837 --> 00:28:44.019]  Now, I've watched some of the Olympic shooting and things, and I know that women are almost as good a shot as men, or maybe even better.
[00:28:44.059 --> 00:28:48.001]  They say that they're more calm and actually learn quicker.
[00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:55.845]  And I've been out with, say, folks like Mike Judge, who brings in a bunch of his Hollywood folks from his show, Silicon Valley, a few years ago when the show was first launching.
[00:28:56.125 --> 00:29:00.267]  And he had several lovely actresses out there who never shot a gun within an hour.
[00:29:01.385 --> 00:29:03.286]  Only shooting maybe 50 rounds, taking turns.
[00:29:03.326 --> 00:29:06.549]  They were hitting bullseye at 100 yards with an M4, 223, 556.
[00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:13.113]  I mean, it was amazing, and they were suddenly pro-gun because they experienced it.
[00:29:13.133 --> 00:29:22.280]  I mean, I don't think there's anything where you can convert someone who's anti-gun quicker than actually going out and having them, you know, use a firearm for the first time and get proper training.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:29.305]  Now, I think it's important not to hand a child or a man or a woman or anybody, you know, say, a .50 caliber rifle the first time so it blows their shoulder off.
[00:29:29.705 --> 00:29:31.006]  I mean, 223 I think is perfect.
[00:29:31.586 --> 00:29:39.210]  What did you make of Biden coming out famously and saying, women, you don't want a Bushmaster or a gun like that.
[00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:41.571]  No, no, you want a shotgun.
[00:29:41.791 --> 00:29:43.732]  You don't need an AR-15.
[00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:45.433]  It's harder to aim.
[00:29:45.853 --> 00:29:46.994]  It's harder to use.
[00:29:47.494 --> 00:29:51.076]  And in fact, you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself.
[00:29:51.636 --> 00:29:52.317]  Buy a shotgun.
[00:29:53.233 --> 00:29:53.853]  Absolutely not.
[00:29:54.133 --> 00:30:00.415]  And he wanted, he suggested that they hold it up in the air and fire a 12-gauge, you know, double-barrel shotgun.
[00:30:00.455 --> 00:30:02.515]  That's just not what, that's not something you should do.
[00:30:02.835 --> 00:30:09.657]  An AR works great, a handgun works great, a double-barrel holding up in the air and firing a warning shot is not what you want to do.
[00:30:09.897 --> 00:30:13.598]  What you want to do is, you pull that gun out when you intend to use it.
[00:30:13.818 --> 00:30:16.378]  If you don't intend to use it, then don't pull the gun, don't pull the gun out.
[00:30:17.059 --> 00:30:18.579]  So that's, that's what I tell people to do.
[00:30:19.341 --> 00:30:27.268]  Statistically, the numbers are out to the various state to state, but generally within about a year of a concealed carry coming in and people signing up, crime drops 20 to 30 percent.
[00:30:27.668 --> 00:30:32.112]  As numbers of firearms ownership goes up, I mean, that's what's brought crime down the last 20 years.
[00:30:33.113 --> 00:30:35.014]  That totally discredits their argument.
[00:30:35.034 --> 00:30:44.062]  Can you talk about some of the numbers and what we see and why is it that CHL holders nationwide, the feds admit, the locals admit, are the most law-abiding people there are?
[00:30:45.005 --> 00:30:46.266]  It's very simple.
[00:30:46.466 --> 00:30:48.067]  More guns equals less crime.
[00:30:48.428 --> 00:30:50.889]  Guns in the hands of the good guy will stop the bad guy.
[00:30:51.089 --> 00:30:55.332]  You want to stop a bad guy with a gun, you know, bring in the good guy and that will stop them.
[00:30:55.652 --> 00:30:57.874]  And it's taken off around the entire country.
[00:30:57.914 --> 00:31:12.143]  You have people that are getting their handgun license, they're purchasing their first firearm, they're learning all the laws, they're learning the right way to do it, they're practicing, they're becoming proficient with that firearm, so that way they can stop that intruder, they can make sure that they don't become that next victim.
[00:31:12.423 --> 00:31:15.604]  And I encourage everyone to do that and I truly live by that.
[00:31:15.885 --> 00:31:18.046]  More guns equals less crime.
[00:31:18.546 --> 00:31:24.108]  A lot of folks have this hysteria about guns and if they would just realize like a nail gun can kill somebody too.
[00:31:24.148 --> 00:31:27.830]  You can go buy that at Home Depot and it'll shoot a nail and kill somebody five feet away.
[00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:31.752]  A car is a big giant weapon but 16 year olds or 15 year olds going to learn how to use it.
[00:31:32.152 --> 00:31:33.633]  People need to get past the mystique.
[00:31:34.413 --> 00:31:40.596]  And go out to a nice gun range with good certified instructors, try it out, and then decide whether they want to be a firearm owner.
[00:31:41.276 --> 00:31:46.138]  In the time we've got left, obviously people in Central Texas can come visit you, we'll put your website on screen.
[00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:49.920]  I've really enjoyed working with you over the last four or five years.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:32:02.546]  But separately, and I'm finally getting around to getting my concealed carry, separately, somebody listening in, say, Atlanta, or somebody listening in other areas of the country, how would you recommend they find a good gun instructor or a good place to get their CHL?
[00:32:03.106 --> 00:32:11.233]  You can check with the NRA, you can check with the NAGR, check a lot of different organizations in your area and find a good instructor.
[00:32:11.313 --> 00:32:13.875]  Make sure they're certified in what they're supposed to do.
[00:32:15.256 --> 00:32:17.698]  And then go out and purchase yourself a good firearm.
[00:32:17.818 --> 00:32:21.461]  Get yourself a good gun, a good concealed carry piece, or whatever you want to use it for.
[00:32:21.761 --> 00:32:25.143]  Walk into the gun store, tell that individual exactly what you want to use it for.
[00:32:25.183 --> 00:32:26.063]  Do you want it at home?
[00:32:26.323 --> 00:32:27.604]  Do you want it in your car?
[00:32:27.864 --> 00:32:35.307]  So that way they can guide you through that process and the best gun for you, for your hands, easy for you to load and stop that threat.
[00:32:35.827 --> 00:32:46.392]  Alright, well let's go out to break and come back with the main host who's hosting tonight here on InfoWars 9ly News with some images of myself later in the future shooting at the range and getting finally certified.
[00:32:46.652 --> 00:32:48.373]  Michael Cargill, thank you for the great work you do my friend.
[00:32:48.593 --> 00:32:49.874]  Absolutely Alex, thank you very much sir.
[00:32:50.219 --> 00:32:50.580]  Thank you.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.742]  All right, stay with us.
[00:32:51.882 --> 00:32:53.325]  More of InfoWars Valley News straight ahead.
[00:33:02.486 --> 00:33:07.267]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.407 --> 00:33:14.469]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:14.729 --> 00:33:23.212]  I started to exercise really hard again, and I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:23.732 --> 00:33:27.553]  But when I started working with Dr. Group and some of the other top formulators in the country,
[00:33:27.913 --> 00:33:34.038]  They said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[00:33:34.278 --> 00:33:34.619]  Boom!
[00:33:34.959 --> 00:33:36.400]  Weight started pouring off.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.402]  Toxins started coming out of my body.
[00:33:38.882 --> 00:33:45.307]  Then, by early 2016, I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my 20s.
[00:33:45.448 --> 00:33:46.528]  But the election heated up.
[00:33:46.588 --> 00:33:48.950]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:51.953]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we
[00:33:52.253 --> 00:33:52.513]  I think.
[00:34:12.415 --> 00:34:15.257]  If the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:34:15.457 --> 00:34:16.377]  It's December 5th, 2016.
[00:34:16.517 --> 00:34:20.339]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:30.645]  And I want to invite all of the Info Warriors of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:34:33.564 --> 00:34:38.547]  One of the most common questions I get is, you've changed the whole radio TV model.
[00:34:39.347 --> 00:34:40.087]  How did you do it?
[00:34:40.127 --> 00:34:41.708]  Did an ad agency teach you that?
[00:34:41.728 --> 00:34:43.029]  Or what book did you read?
[00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:44.910]  And the answer is, it was trial and error.
[00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:50.472]  I promote products that I personally use, like the Nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:50.953 --> 00:34:52.774]  And it's the same thing for this promotion.
[00:34:53.254 --> 00:34:54.595]  I didn't get this from an ad agency.
[00:34:54.655 --> 00:34:55.855]  I didn't just think this up.
[00:34:56.335 --> 00:34:58.436]  I was sitting there, I'd gained probably 10-15 pounds.
[00:34:59.657 --> 00:35:03.199]  Because I've gotten out of the habit of taking the supplements in the last few months with the election.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.122]  And I was thinking, wow, I need to religiously take these.
[00:35:07.662 --> 00:35:08.903]  Because I'm promoting these things.
[00:35:08.963 --> 00:35:09.823]  It's making me healthier.
[00:35:10.083 --> 00:35:12.545]  And if I'm not taking them, you know, I'm fatter.
[00:35:12.785 --> 00:35:14.026]  Plus, people aren't going to buy the product.
[00:35:14.526 --> 00:35:15.967]  So that's where the promotion comes from.
[00:35:16.267 --> 00:35:17.628]  It's purely from reality.
[00:35:18.004 --> 00:35:19.845]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:35:20.245 --> 00:35:24.827]  I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:31.649]  I've lost five pounds, religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:32.569]  It's amazing.
[00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.230]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[00:35:35.511 --> 00:35:38.212]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:35:38.412 --> 00:35:40.993]  And to be clear, I'm exercising the same amount.
[00:35:41.673 --> 00:35:45.574]  It's the holidays, so I'm eating pumpkin pie, pecan pie.
[00:35:45.594 --> 00:35:46.995]  I ate a candy bar last night.
[00:35:48.439 --> 00:35:51.581]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:53.282]  So I'm eating worse.
[00:35:53.902 --> 00:36:01.286]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[00:36:01.426 --> 00:36:01.967]  It's incredible.
[00:36:02.967 --> 00:36:04.908]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:06.409]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[00:36:06.509 --> 00:36:08.931]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[00:36:09.531 --> 00:36:10.412]  This is an experiment.
[00:36:10.512 --> 00:36:11.272]  Everybody's watching.
[00:36:11.512 --> 00:36:12.353]  We'll see what happens.
[00:36:12.793 --> 00:36:13.633]  This is Part 2.
[00:36:14.744 --> 00:36:15.685]  Next week, part three.
[00:36:16.445 --> 00:36:17.065]  That's a good point.
[00:36:17.866 --> 00:36:26.990]  We just cut there and Rob Deuce said, hey Alex, I know you don't follow script, but you might want to add to people, we're running some of the biggest specials of the year until December 17th.
[00:36:27.271 --> 00:36:32.994]  That's the last day that you can get your order in and have guaranteed shipping anywhere in the United States.
[00:36:33.194 --> 00:36:34.935]  And we have some of the biggest specials of the year.
[00:36:35.795 --> 00:36:38.837]  50% off many of the nutraceuticals, the lowest discounts 25%, 30% off X2,
[00:36:41.898 --> 00:36:51.788]  Huge discounts and free shipping storewide on every product, thousands of items, and on top of that, if you sign up for auto ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:36:51.828 --> 00:36:59.276]  And I'm going to do one more bad thing because I'm politically correct, or I guess I'm politically incorrect, and that's say Merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:36:59.596 --> 00:37:00.777]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:37:00.837 --> 00:37:01.418]  You're awesome.
[00:37:04.295 --> 00:37:09.978]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com and I wanted to find out who General Mad Dog Mattis really is.
[00:37:10.278 --> 00:37:18.242]  So I put out on all my social media to find marines, to find devil dogs, so they could tell us who the real General Mattis really is.
[00:37:19.022 --> 00:37:21.323]  Who is General Mad Dog Mattis?
[00:37:21.623 --> 00:37:26.966]  My name is Sergeant James Daniel Meltersen and I was an amphibious assault vehicle crew chief.
[00:37:27.046 --> 00:37:31.348]  I was 1833, was the MOS code, stationed out in 29 Palms, California.
[00:37:32.128 --> 00:37:34.389]  But today we're talking about Mad Dog Mattis, alright?
[00:37:34.869 --> 00:37:36.230]  So, General Mattis.
[00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:41.872]  Commonly referred to by three different pseudonyms or nicknames.
[00:37:42.773 --> 00:37:45.354]  One was what I just said, that Mad Dog Mattis himself.
[00:37:46.014 --> 00:37:47.355]  The second is Warrior Monk.
[00:37:47.395 --> 00:37:48.075]  How cool is that?
[00:37:48.155 --> 00:37:52.777]  Why wouldn't anybody want a Secretary of Defense that is also known as a Warrior Monk?
[00:37:53.057 --> 00:37:53.817]  Are you kidding me?
[00:37:53.837 --> 00:37:54.858]  That's awesome.
[00:37:55.518 --> 00:37:59.161]  Third one, maybe not many people know about this one, but it's Chaos.
[00:37:59.621 --> 00:38:03.143]  And Chaos is actually a nickname that he got, or an acronym that he got.
[00:38:03.784 --> 00:38:07.466]  And Chaos stands for Colonel, has an outstanding solution.
[00:38:07.786 --> 00:38:10.208]  And that's an interesting nickname, Warrior Monk.
[00:38:10.648 --> 00:38:12.510]  It's because he chose a bachelor of life.
[00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:17.873]  He devoted every ounce of his time to studying the art of war.
[00:38:18.874 --> 00:38:38.825]  The devotion it took to understand to just push all these other things away and to focus on his main objective, taking care of Marines, leading them into combat, letting them know that you don't go in there without a plan, that you need to be smart, that you need to understand what is going to happen when you go into combat.
[00:38:39.565 --> 00:38:41.227]  This is someone that we definitely want.
[00:38:41.267 --> 00:38:42.388]  Someone who's not hot-headed.
[00:38:42.948 --> 00:38:45.491]  Someone who does make the right decision.
[00:38:45.551 --> 00:38:49.275]  Someone who's dedicated their lives to understanding this.
[00:38:49.815 --> 00:38:52.177]  This is a great pick by Donald Trump.
[00:38:52.378 --> 00:38:57.743]  Is it true that you always kept with you a copy of the meditations of Marcus Aurelius?
[00:38:58.736 --> 00:38:59.437]  It is, Peter.
[00:38:59.597 --> 00:39:02.079]  That one and quite a few other books, actually.
[00:39:02.399 --> 00:39:12.286]  So, a Roman emperor who died 18 centuries ago remained relevant to you as a commander in the United States Marine Corps in what way?
[00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:18.763]  It was good for me to be reminded that I faced nothing new under the sun.
[00:39:19.823 --> 00:39:31.727]  Technology throws a few odd wrinkles in, but the bottom line is the fundamental impulses, the fundamental challenges, and the solutions are pretty timeless in my line of work.
[00:39:32.247 --> 00:39:38.970]  It will send a message to the rest of the world and those that oppose the United States that we actually mean business now.
[00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:42.531]  Because this General is known for his straightforward
[00:39:43.536 --> 00:39:46.157]  Not politically correct way of doing things.
[00:39:46.957 --> 00:39:54.179]  A lot of people are going to say that they like Mattis for the fact that he's a, you know, brawler and kind of a Marines Marine.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:07.083]  Which I like him for that reason too, but I think what really sets him apart is the fact that he's the consummate professional when it comes to learning and studying warfare.
[00:40:07.103 --> 00:40:11.625]  I don't think that there's anybody else alive today that knows as much about warfighting as he does.
[00:40:12.424 --> 00:40:17.806]  What would Alexander the Great have seen in radical Islam that he would have recognized?
[00:40:19.127 --> 00:40:31.192]  When he was fighting in the same region back several thousand years ago, he confronted basically what looked like an implacable foe, someone with a very different world view.
[00:40:31.772 --> 00:40:36.134]  He was unconcerned in some ways about his own tactics.
[00:40:36.174 --> 00:40:41.476]  He had confidence that he knew how his forces could act and their behavior on the battlefield.
[00:40:42.316 --> 00:40:45.399]  What he was concerned with was how to understand this enemy.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:56.930]  And he would have found an enemy that even though it was not Islam oriented in any way, it was still a culture that looked at the world differently than his.
[00:40:57.051 --> 00:41:02.055]  So he sought to understand it, and as he understood it, he understood how he would go after it.
[00:41:03.317 --> 00:41:05.579]  When you've got foreign
[00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:35.867]  military leaders looking at this guy immediately they're going to have respect and when you have respect between two nations fighting forces immediately is what you have is a smoothing out of situations and you also have that underlying sense that wow well this guy really knows how to engage
[00:41:36.693 --> 00:41:47.977]  And if things get bad, it makes him a more formidable enemy because he understands exactly what it takes to win.
[00:41:48.617 --> 00:41:54.179]  So, before committing to combat, understand the enemy.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:55.240]  Absolutely.
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.061]  Yeah, Mad Dog is going to shake things up.
[00:41:59.707 --> 00:42:03.289]  He led the battle into Fallujah, where they kicked ass.
[00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:23.863]  Marines went into buildings where women and children were cowering in the buildings, and people who did not live there had come in and fired from those homes, not allowing these innocent people to get out of the line of fire, breaking every rule, whether it be of the law of war, of decency, of the Koran, or anything else, and firing at us, knowing full well that we would have to fire back.
[00:42:24.423 --> 00:42:25.223]  Nothing really can stop us.
[00:42:25.243 --> 00:42:28.145]  And we just don't take refuge in self-pity or any of that kind of stuff.
[00:42:28.165 --> 00:42:29.966]  He issues a reading list to all of his subordinates.
[00:42:29.986 --> 00:42:30.706]  He thinks that
[00:42:49.867 --> 00:43:00.713]  Learning from others' mistakes in history is much better than learning from your own mistakes, because learning from your own mistakes in warfare usually costs you your men's lives in the process.
[00:43:01.613 --> 00:43:11.178]  He had said, thanks to my reading, I've never been caught flat-footed in any situation, never at a loss for how any problem has been addressed successfully or unsuccessfully before.
[00:43:11.198 --> 00:43:17.121]  I used to use a lot of his quotes and everything as a Marine NCO to try to encourage my Marines to
[00:43:17.847 --> 00:43:25.520]  Read more about military history and military theory because I thought it made them develop a lot better professionally.
[00:43:26.363 --> 00:43:28.545]  Better Marines and better warfighters.
[00:43:28.585 --> 00:43:31.207]  General Mattis came out and spoke to everybody who was out in Tornam Palms.
[00:43:31.227 --> 00:43:36.972]  We were doing a pre-deployment training and in the military there's this term of they.
[00:43:37.092 --> 00:43:42.696]  They said, this nameless, faceless entity whenever s*** comes downhill, it's they said.
[00:43:43.337 --> 00:43:49.402]  Well General Mattis got up on the stage and he wanted us to know that we're going downrange pretty soon and some of the stuff that you know
[00:43:50.558 --> 00:43:55.121]  The order that we would be given, you know, we'd have to think, you know, who's coming up with this stuff?
[00:43:55.181 --> 00:43:58.263]  And he made it very clear that he was they.
[00:43:58.644 --> 00:44:00.725]  General Mattis is they.
[00:44:01.165 --> 00:44:02.706]  You should be very scared of General Mattis.
[00:44:02.746 --> 00:44:03.327]  He is they.
[00:44:03.347 --> 00:44:09.131]  The bottom line, I think here, is that I owe my best military advice.
[00:44:09.211 --> 00:44:16.316]  And at times that's uncomfortable for a democracy that believes in freedom and it believes in peace and prosperity.
[00:44:17.448 --> 00:44:26.917]  The idea that this level of evil can exist is incompatible with our view of what we would like to see as we turn over this world to our children.
[00:44:27.618 --> 00:44:35.064]  But I'm also convinced, having dealt with this enemy since 1979, which was the first time I sailed into those waters on U.S.
[00:44:35.124 --> 00:44:35.685]  Navy ships,
[00:44:36.431 --> 00:44:40.573]  Uh... that we're up against an enemy that means what they say and we should not patronize them.
[00:44:40.833 --> 00:44:45.095]  So at the beginning of this video I asked the question, who is Mad Dog Mattis?
[00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:48.597]  And I think we have that answered pretty clearly at this point in time.
[00:44:49.217 --> 00:44:51.699]  This is a man who chose the art of war
[00:44:52.839 --> 00:44:54.339]  Over his own personal life.
[00:44:54.359 --> 00:45:00.341]  This is a man who served the Marine Corps and America tirelessly for many years.
[00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:16.044]  Just from what you've been able to see from Marines who have served under him thus far, the passion, the way he held them to a higher standard, the way he wanted them to be smart and understand combat and understand how that can affect you and your psyche.
[00:45:16.744 --> 00:45:22.305]  This is someone that we definitely need in our Trump cabinet.
[00:45:22.665 --> 00:45:27.066]  It's amazing to see someone like this, to hear him speak, to see his motivation.
[00:45:27.546 --> 00:45:36.108]  I'm very uplifted and excited to see what General Mad Dog Mattis will do as our next Secretary of Defense.
[00:45:36.708 --> 00:45:39.009]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[00:45:39.209 --> 00:45:40.809]  I'm driving right now.
[00:45:42.463 --> 00:45:55.045]  And I'm seriously almost in f***ing tears, because goddamn Mad Dog f***ing Mattis is gonna be the new f***ing Secretary of f***ing War!
[00:45:57.606 --> 00:46:00.326]  Are we doing a good job with our cabinet and our people?
[00:46:00.606 --> 00:46:03.067]  One of our great, great generals.
[00:46:07.408 --> 00:46:08.768]  Don't let it outside, right?
[00:46:10.819 --> 00:46:13.640]  And of course the press is very honest, they'll never let this go.
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:18.101]  Even though it's all live, they've got about seven stations live.
[00:46:20.422 --> 00:46:30.585]  We are going to appoint Mad Dog Mattis as our Secretary of Defense.
[00:46:38.663 --> 00:46:42.367]  But we're not announcing it till Monday, so don't tell anybody.
[00:46:43.889 --> 00:46:50.196]  They say he's the closest thing to General George Patton that we have, and it's about time.
[00:46:50.376 --> 00:46:51.777]  It's about time.
[00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:11.162]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:20.944]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.364 --> 00:47:25.205]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.225 --> 00:47:28.326]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.726 --> 00:47:29.806]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.

[00:49:05.725 --> 00:49:10.910]  Well, fresh off the heels of her defeat, it was time for Hillary Clinton to pay the piper.
[00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:12.952]  No, not we the American people.
[00:49:13.052 --> 00:49:16.735]  It was time for her to answer to her mega-millionaire donors.
[00:49:17.196 --> 00:49:23.682]  Now, she threw this big party last night to thank the millionaire donors in New York City there, and
[00:49:24.202 --> 00:49:27.945]  The Democratic donors, they weren't buying her story that it was the Russians.
[00:49:28.145 --> 00:49:29.786]  It was FBI Director James Comey.
[00:49:30.187 --> 00:49:31.327]  They want answers.
[00:49:31.347 --> 00:49:32.849]  They're asking for this post-mortem.
[00:49:32.889 --> 00:49:33.889]  Where did we go wrong?
[00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:37.372]  Now, I'm joined by Owen Schroyer and Margaret Howell.
[00:49:37.432 --> 00:49:38.633]  Let's talk about this a little bit.
[00:49:38.793 --> 00:49:45.218]  Total glum, very downcast Hillary Clinton, full of excuses, just like President Obama in his speech today.
[00:49:45.523 --> 00:49:50.225]  Well, the sad thing is, this is the tactic of, say, a five-year-old.
[00:49:50.545 --> 00:49:51.145]  Blame everyone else.
[00:49:51.185 --> 00:49:52.326]  Yeah, blame everyone else.
[00:49:52.406 --> 00:49:54.047]  You know, Hillary wants to blame the Russians.
[00:49:54.107 --> 00:49:55.847]  She wants to blame Comey.
[00:49:56.267 --> 00:49:57.768]  She wants to blame fake news.
[00:49:57.828 --> 00:49:59.589]  She wants to blame uneducated voters.
[00:49:59.649 --> 00:50:00.749]  The list goes on and on.
[00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:01.730]  You know what?
[00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:03.711]  Why don't you just look in the mirror, Hillary?
[00:50:04.131 --> 00:50:05.751]  You're a disgusting, corrupt witch.
[00:50:06.152 --> 00:50:06.372]  Right.
[00:50:06.472 --> 00:50:07.892]  We saw the WikiLeaks emails.
[00:50:07.992 --> 00:50:09.013]  We can still read.
[00:50:09.573 --> 00:50:11.294]  And that's why you didn't win.
[00:50:12.114 --> 00:50:18.242]  And this is what's sad to me is as we continue to see this push of Russia hacking, Russia influence, all this stuff.
[00:50:18.802 --> 00:50:31.538]  If Russia hacked Trump or Russia hacked the RNC and released emails that exposed corruption within the Trump cabinet or campaign or within the Republicans, they would be applauding Russia.
[00:50:31.738 --> 00:50:35.460]  They would be loving Russia, but because it's against their candidate, they hate Russia.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:40.563]  And it's funny, they had a problem with fake news about weapons of mass destruction and government lies about that.
[00:50:40.963 --> 00:50:44.025]  But when they make stuff up about Russia, they fall for it hook, line and sinker.
[00:50:44.065 --> 00:50:46.567]  We have to just trust these intelligence agencies.
[00:50:46.867 --> 00:50:52.470]  And so now these are Democratic donors who pumped more than a billion dollars into Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:57.593]  So they're saying, we're not going to even be donating to the party anymore until you let us know what the heck is wrong.
[00:50:57.833 --> 00:50:58.553]  She was the party.
[00:50:58.573 --> 00:51:07.157]  Clinton says it's personal beef by Putin that led to these hacking attacks because she once called out the elections there in Russia, said they weren't fair.
[00:51:07.558 --> 00:51:21.124]  John Podesta comes out, says something is deeply broken at the FBI, so they're blaming all these other agencies when of course John Podesta, it's revealed that he fell for a phishing scam in his email that anyone could fall for and get hacked.
[00:51:21.144 --> 00:51:24.606]  There's a problem with you and your office, John Podesta.
[00:51:25.267 --> 00:51:27.007]  Doesn't seem like a very bright guy.
[00:51:27.027 --> 00:51:36.470]  Well, he is very inside the beltway in terms of being bright, but when it comes to common sense like this... Hey, look, just going back to your answer where you go, where is the post-mortem of this?
[00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:39.450]  It rode away in her medical van with her.
[00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:42.131]  Just going back to that comment, I couldn't pass it up.
[00:51:42.691 --> 00:51:43.291]  He's just mad.
[00:51:43.311 --> 00:51:43.691]  You know what?
[00:51:44.351 --> 00:51:50.353]  He should be grateful that the FBI didn't go after him criminally, frankly, instead of just being emotionally broken.
[00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:51.413]  I mean, what is he, five?
[00:51:51.473 --> 00:51:52.553]  He's broken deeply?
[00:51:52.653 --> 00:51:53.194]  Deeply broken.
[00:51:53.214 --> 00:51:54.714]  Does he mean emotionally, I'm assuming?
[00:51:55.094 --> 00:51:57.296]  And what is this FBI he's talking about?
[00:51:57.477 --> 00:51:58.518]  Obama's FBI?
[00:51:59.359 --> 00:52:01.140]  Obama who campaigned for Hillary?
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:08.248]  Yeah, who, by the way, when James Comey originally said that Hillary Clinton, you know, nothing to see here, they were lauding him.
[00:52:08.288 --> 00:52:09.028]  How amazing.
[00:52:09.489 --> 00:52:11.491]  No one can question his integrity.
[00:52:11.531 --> 00:52:11.871]  He's great.
[00:52:12.632 --> 00:52:18.659]  So then, of course, he came out right before the election saying it's still, it's, you know, we're going to reopen this investigation.
[00:52:18.719 --> 00:52:19.900]  So Hillary's blaming it on him.
[00:52:20.441 --> 00:52:24.005]  Meanwhile, we've got the story coming out in telephone conversations with Donald Trump.
[00:52:24.025 --> 00:52:31.633]  The FBI director actually assured the president-elect that there was no credible evidence that Russia influenced the outcome of this election.
[00:52:31.694 --> 00:52:33.896]  So they are completely at odds with each other.
[00:52:33.916 --> 00:52:35.638]  That echoes exactly what the Russians are saying.
[00:52:35.678 --> 00:52:40.685]  Look, Dmitry Peskov in Tokyo today, the spokesperson for Putin said, if you've got anything, put it out.
[00:52:40.785 --> 00:52:41.766]  Put up or shut up.
[00:52:41.806 --> 00:52:42.807]  We're tired of being accused.
[00:52:43.128 --> 00:52:46.172]  Look, if you have anything on us at all, release it.
[00:52:46.312 --> 00:52:47.473]  Show us the information.
[00:52:48.054 --> 00:52:50.798]  And the president has it because he can't?
[00:52:51.178 --> 00:52:52.779]  Well, and here's my issue, too.
[00:52:53.299 --> 00:52:58.741]  You know, Obama was talking about propaganda, Russian propaganda influencing this election.
[00:52:59.161 --> 00:52:59.721]  So, you know what?
[00:52:59.801 --> 00:53:01.262]  I'm only going to talk about what I know.
[00:53:01.482 --> 00:53:03.163]  I don't know who released the emails.
[00:53:03.323 --> 00:53:03.823]  I don't know.
[00:53:03.903 --> 00:53:04.383]  You don't know.
[00:53:04.443 --> 00:53:05.724]  We have our own opinions, right?
[00:53:05.924 --> 00:53:07.684]  Maybe, let's say, it was the Russians.
[00:53:07.844 --> 00:53:08.405]  Okay, fine.
[00:53:08.425 --> 00:53:11.186]  The Russians hacked the DNC and released these emails.
[00:53:11.906 --> 00:53:13.808]  It's not Russian propaganda.
[00:53:13.828 --> 00:53:19.835]  These are emails written by people in the DNC, people in John Podesta's camp.
[00:53:20.216 --> 00:53:21.938]  So it's not Russian propaganda.
[00:53:21.978 --> 00:53:26.703]  These are actual, real emails, regardless of who leaked them.
[00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:28.104]  That's what it is here with the election.
[00:53:28.184 --> 00:53:31.367]  If it's anyone's propaganda, it's the DNC's.
[00:53:31.467 --> 00:53:35.850]  Speaking of propaganda, the New York Times is saying that Trump is a threat to our democracy.
[00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:41.634]  His authoritarian and anti-democratic rhetoric is a direct threat to our democracy.
[00:53:41.815 --> 00:53:42.915]  Talk about laughable jokes.
[00:53:45.077 --> 00:53:52.719]  Well, and even we have John Kerry saying that he's refusing to join in on the claims that Russia hacked the elections.
[00:53:52.839 --> 00:54:01.802]  He said the intelligence agencies, he refuses to acknowledge anything by these anonymous sources in the intelligence.
[00:54:01.942 --> 00:54:03.582]  I mean, he used air quotes for that.
[00:54:03.962 --> 00:54:05.363]  He says, I'm not going to do that.
[00:54:06.923 --> 00:54:23.388]  The people covering their tails right now because Obama did something in a similar fashion in this press conference when he was asked directly if he thinks the electors should not vote for Trump or if he thinks the electors need to hear an intelligence briefing about how Russia influenced the election.
[00:54:23.748 --> 00:54:33.511]  He dipped and dodged and dove under that question and then it comes out, it's official, well at least for right now, that there will not be an intelligence briefing for the electors.
[00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:38.053]  You know, it kind of feels like water is seeping through this argument.
[00:54:38.093 --> 00:54:52.860]  Yeah, and it's just, it just goes to show you how little they actually care about the democracy because A, they don't want anyone to look at the contents of the emails and how that the DNC was actually influencing this election in collusion with the media.
[00:54:53.461 --> 00:55:03.666]  But there's also a report coming out that the Obama administration refused to act aggressively on this idea that there were Russian hackers interfering because they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win.
[00:55:04.486 --> 00:55:09.730]  And that's why Donald Trump said, you know, well, why are we just hearing about this now afterward?
[00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:13.273]  You know, surprisingly, though, they thought she was going to win.
[00:55:13.333 --> 00:55:13.993]  She didn't.
[00:55:14.194 --> 00:55:15.074]  So you know what?
[00:55:15.194 --> 00:55:16.896]  If they have the information, they need to release it.
[00:55:17.356 --> 00:55:22.200]  Speaking of Obama and Clinton, by the way, because we know here at InfoWars the crime she's committed against you and I.
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.781]  We've covered them profusely.
[00:55:23.881 --> 00:55:28.484]  And so many people, Leanne, want to see, they don't want to see Obama pardon her.
[00:55:28.504 --> 00:55:29.645]  And that's what's coming up next.
[00:55:29.725 --> 00:55:32.746]  Three in one people surveyed say, look, don't pardon her.
[00:55:32.847 --> 00:55:33.727]  We don't want this.
[00:55:33.747 --> 00:55:34.888]  You don't speak for us.
[00:55:35.248 --> 00:55:37.550]  She needs to be held responsible for what she's done.
[00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:40.892]  And the fear is that on his way out, that's exactly what he's going to do.
[00:55:40.912 --> 00:55:41.972]  This blanket pardon.
[00:55:42.313 --> 00:55:49.497]  So any crime she's committed, you know, unless they can come up with something else that she's done, he's just going to blanket it and wipe it off as though it didn't happen.
[00:55:49.537 --> 00:55:50.878]  Just kind of like a thank you gift.
[00:55:51.679 --> 00:55:52.960]  He's got some time to think about it.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.982]  He's going to go on a nice luxurious vacation.
[00:55:55.022 --> 00:55:56.544]  You know, he's claiming this.
[00:55:56.684 --> 00:56:03.350]  I mean, these are grave claims about Russia hacking our... Not serious enough for him to stay out of Hawaii, though.
[00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.951]  Exactly.
[00:56:03.991 --> 00:56:08.135]  So he's going to talk about how there's all these grave threats, you know, Russia, global warming, all this stuff.
[00:56:08.716 --> 00:56:09.596]  Bye, though.
[00:56:09.697 --> 00:56:09.997]  Bye.
[00:56:10.017 --> 00:56:11.218]  Hey, everything's bad.
[00:56:11.358 --> 00:56:12.159]  See ya.
[00:56:12.519 --> 00:56:13.300]  Peace out.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.882]  And it's not like you could wait.
[00:56:15.242 --> 00:56:18.245]  It's not like he could wait another month to go on vacation when he's out of the White House.
[00:56:18.285 --> 00:56:20.146]  He's got to do it right now.
[00:56:20.166 --> 00:56:22.548]  What's the last chance to spend it on a taxpayer dime?
[00:56:22.668 --> 00:56:29.894]  Well, we know that's going to happen and all the people that are going to have to be part of his armed service that are going to have to spend time away from their family.
[00:56:30.234 --> 00:56:34.518]  But I also want to just take it back for a second to the thing that you mentioned at the beginning of the segment.
[00:56:34.978 --> 00:56:36.839]  So Hillary Clinton, what is Hillary Clinton doing?
[00:56:37.179 --> 00:56:39.540]  She's going to some mega donor ball.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:40.281]  Raising money over Christmas.
[00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:41.761]  Raising money over Christmas.
[00:56:41.802 --> 00:56:45.243]  Some huge massive donor thing.
[00:56:45.303 --> 00:56:47.164]  But she's not the big donor candidate, right?
[00:56:47.244 --> 00:56:49.285]  But what is Donald Trump doing at the same time?
[00:56:49.625 --> 00:56:55.548]  He's in Hershey, Pennsylvania on a thank you tour speaking to the Americans who got him elected.
[00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:57.529]  This is the difference.
[00:56:57.649 --> 00:57:01.611]  Hopefully we're done dealing with Clinton-Trump and we're just Trump from here on out.
[00:57:01.992 --> 00:57:03.472]  We'll find out what they do with these electors.
[00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:04.053]  But again,
[00:57:04.773 --> 00:57:05.514]  What is Clinton doing?
[00:57:05.574 --> 00:57:07.575]  She's sitting around with the richest people in the world.
[00:57:07.936 --> 00:57:09.437]  Those are the people that put her in power.
[00:57:09.637 --> 00:57:10.457]  What is Trump doing?
[00:57:10.778 --> 00:57:14.380]  He's going to a thank you tour to speak to the Americans who got him elected.
[00:57:14.741 --> 00:57:16.202]  That's who put Trump in power.
[00:57:16.522 --> 00:57:21.486]  There's the distinct difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton illustrated in one night.
[00:57:22.227 --> 00:57:26.211]  Well, what do you think about the veiled threat that the outgoing U.S.
[00:57:26.231 --> 00:57:37.903]  President Barack Obama made saying, you know, I think there's no doubt when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections, we need to take action and we will at a time and a place of our own choosing.
[00:57:38.123 --> 00:57:41.985]  How many times have we tried to influence the elections of other countries?
[00:57:42.245 --> 00:57:43.506]  Successfully, mind you.
[00:57:44.046 --> 00:57:50.309]  We could make a list at the table of all the times we propped up rogue governments, tried to influence elections.
[00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:54.231]  Destabilizing the Middle East, removing Saddam for power, Gaddafi, it goes on and on.
[00:57:54.411 --> 00:57:58.513]  Apparently does not apply to him, only to Russia, even though it's laughable.
[00:57:58.753 --> 00:58:00.774]  Jill Stein said this to our camera, Leigh, and I know we're running out of time.
[00:58:00.794 --> 00:58:03.595]  She said, look, we'd be at war with Russia if Hillary Clinton's in office.
[00:58:03.975 --> 00:58:08.718]  It's so shocking that now she's suddenly flopped and thinks that we should still want to go to war.
[00:58:08.878 --> 00:58:09.218]  Okay.
[00:58:09.758 --> 00:58:14.400]  And how about the influence, the corrupt influence domestically within the Democratic Party?
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.841]  They completely ignore that influence on the election.
[00:58:17.481 --> 00:58:22.083]  Rigging debates, collusion with media, pay-for-play programs, that's the corruption.
[00:58:22.223 --> 00:58:24.464]  Right, and they don't want any of us to look at it.
[00:58:24.524 --> 00:58:30.426]  CNN, it's illegal for anyone but CNN to go in and look and to feed you the information.
[00:58:30.806 --> 00:58:38.349]  It's not going to get flagged by the new Facebook fake news flaggers that they have out there that are going to decide what you're allowed to.
[00:58:38.929 --> 00:58:40.511]  To interact with what type of information.
[00:58:40.831 --> 00:58:42.973]  This is the internet kill switch people.
[00:58:43.053 --> 00:58:47.718]  They're just slowly rolling it out and they're pretending like they're doing you a favor.
[00:58:48.078 --> 00:58:50.261]  Well guys, thank you so much for tuning into the show tonight.

[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.930]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:20.115]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.435 --> 00:59:24.176]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.737 --> 00:59:27.578]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.779 --> 00:59:36.003]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
