[00:00:12.077 --> 00:00:14.299]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:18.002]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[00:00:20.043 --> 00:00:26.068]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:29.150]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.493]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[00:00:33.373 --> 00:00:35.875]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:37.917]  Amarillo by morning.
[00:00:39.187 --> 00:00:41.087]  Amarillo's where I'll be.
[00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:46.729]  And I am coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:48.209]  We'll be here for the next four hours.
[00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:49.949]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.570]  On this Monday, the 29th day of August 2016.
[00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:06.033]  Thematically, every day, looking at hundreds and hundreds of news stories, a theme will emerge.
[00:01:07.435 --> 00:01:14.941]  And more often than not, the number one theme is global censorship of news and information.
[00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:27.112]  Many people will look at the collapse of the dinosaur media and the collapse of its credibility as something positive, and I do overall, but really now, what do they have to lose?
[00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:35.179]  They have only intensified, and then intensified again, and then intensified again and again and again,
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.123]  The unification of deception and twisting information.
[00:01:43.224 --> 00:01:46.245]  But we have parallel media that is exposing it in real time.
[00:01:47.746 --> 00:01:52.649]  The next logical move for them to engage in is the takeover and the shutdown of that media.
[00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.673]  We were warned last year, right around this time of year by Matt Drudge, that he was told massive censorship
[00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.331]  Was coming to the internet this year.
[00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:06.114]  And now we have even the Wall Street Journal today.
[00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:08.416]  An internet giveaway to the UN.
[00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:11.439]  The agreement with ICANN has been kept secret.
[00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:17.924]  And now they've gotten parts of it and it is the turnover to the UN.
[00:02:18.745 --> 00:02:19.566]  And that dovetails
[00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:25.657]  With the fact that we have new documents from the Daily Caller.
[00:02:25.977 --> 00:02:27.898]  We need to do a unified story about this.
[00:02:28.578 --> 00:02:29.679]  Soros document.
[00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.160]  Regulate internet to favor open society supporters.
[00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:47.726]  We've already seen the wave, the army, the constellation, the force of socialist, globalist, communist, world government pushers
[00:02:49.201 --> 00:03:05.264]  On everything from Facebook to Twitter to Google to Alexa being boosted and anyone who is for an open free society being delisted basically being shown to have no viewers or visitors even as your traffic spikes.
[00:03:06.904 --> 00:03:07.964]  Unified deception.
[00:03:08.024 --> 00:03:10.125]  So he called for this in the emails.
[00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:11.865]  This is already going on.
[00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:17.726]  Germany and France are just a few years ahead of where we're at.
[00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:23.004]  Chinese-style communist censorship is the global goal.
[00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:26.405]  So you look at the theme just today.
[00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:28.386]  This is just a small smattering.
[00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:30.627]  An internet giveaway to the UN.
[00:03:31.407 --> 00:03:32.028]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:34.969]  And they go into it and they say, it's unbelievable.
[00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.670]  The conspiracy theorists are right.
[00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.770]  It's a UN takeover.
[00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:39.891]  We're not conspiracy theorists.
[00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:41.572]  We know the globalist plan.
[00:03:43.018 --> 00:03:44.239]  We have the emails, after all.
[00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.240]  Soros document.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.702]  Regulate internet to favor open society supporters.
[00:03:47.742 --> 00:03:52.946]  When they say open society, they mean global government overrunning your national sovereignty, installing tyranny.
[00:03:53.987 --> 00:03:55.648]  Just look at that demon in that photo.
[00:03:55.888 --> 00:03:56.489]  You're a TV viewer.
[00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:03.915]  And meanwhile, AP reports Pope Francis chits chats in person with Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook.
[00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:08.689]  That's right, they're organizing everything together.
[00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:15.171]  He's calling for censorship, the Pope is, saying Europe being Christian is abhorrent, disgusting.
[00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:16.252]  These are quotes.
[00:04:16.972 --> 00:04:21.213]  BBC, Europe migrant crisis, Germany expects 300,000 a year, that means a million.
[00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.271]  But let's look at these little Soros stories.
[00:04:28.092 --> 00:04:29.734]  DC leaks website down.
[00:04:29.814 --> 00:04:33.538]  Twitter suspended after releasing Soros stocks.
[00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.161]  Oh, the website gets hacked and taken down.
[00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:37.142]  Twitter suspends.
[00:04:37.703 --> 00:04:39.204]  Unified shut down.
[00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:41.127]  Nice little testes.
[00:04:43.308 --> 00:04:45.008]  And then, meanwhile, here's another one for you.
[00:04:45.508 --> 00:04:46.689]  Infowars.com.
[00:04:47.209 --> 00:05:00.171]  Huffington Post bans journalists who's written for them for years for writing about Hillary's health, deletes article, an article that simply pointed out that one of Watson's videos alone has over 4 million views and that it's a national issue.
[00:05:01.371 --> 00:05:02.052]  And you know what?
[00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:06.232]  He's been terminated and the story's been deleted.
[00:05:06.252 --> 00:05:09.053]  Oh, and then I've got more censorship.
[00:05:09.073 --> 00:05:09.453]  Straight ahead.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.041]  They said in October I'd be dead in six months.
[00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:19.322]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:05:20.063 --> 00:05:29.405]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:05:29.565 --> 00:05:31.706]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:05:33.908 --> 00:05:38.751]  The intervention led by NATO to topple Qaddafi has led to a failed state.
[00:05:43.494 --> 00:05:50.538]  Maybe Libya was not perfect under Qaddafi, but it had, even if to some extent, a functioning government, one unified country.
[00:05:50.938 --> 00:05:52.059]  It was a sovereign state.
[00:05:53.635 --> 00:06:00.360]  Libya now has two rival governments, a civil war that has left over 4,000 people dead, and its cities are in ruin.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:07.104]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[00:06:07.465 --> 00:06:11.908]  Women are treated, discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[00:06:12.268 --> 00:06:15.750]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[00:06:15.811 --> 00:06:16.691]  They're mistreated.
[00:06:17.372 --> 00:06:18.753]  She claims to be their champion.
[00:06:19.053 --> 00:06:19.973]  We led ISIS.
[00:06:20.954 --> 00:06:21.955]  Take this position.
[00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:28.460]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:40.248]  We had this brilliant idea that we were going to come to Pakistan and create a force of Mujahideen, equip them with stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets inside Afghanistan.
[00:06:40.928 --> 00:06:42.089]  And we were successful.
[00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:44.331]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[00:06:44.431 --> 00:06:50.937]  When Vince Foster left his White House office on that July day in 1993, he told his secretary that he would be back.
[00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:55.721]  But the Deputy White House Counsel and boyhood friend of Bill Clinton never returned.
[00:06:56.042 --> 00:06:59.285]  There has been this urgency to end this.
[00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:03.348]  And, you know, historically that makes no sense.
[00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:08.313]  We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.
[00:07:08.513 --> 00:07:17.962]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:07:18.002 --> 00:07:19.764]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:07:20.184 --> 00:07:31.595]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:36.578]  Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks.
[00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:40.061]  We have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton.
[00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:45.305]  You know, the emails we published show that Hillary Clinton is receiving constant updates.
[00:07:46.337 --> 00:07:47.799]  About my personal situation.
[00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:58.189]  There's a 27-year-old that works for the DNC who was shot in the back, murdered just two weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.
[00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:04.976]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[00:08:17.677 --> 00:08:28.568]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:35.434]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:41.937 --> 00:08:45.279]  It is Monday, the 29th day of August 2016.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.783]  I'm your host Alex Jones and we're gonna be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:50.483 --> 00:08:51.284]  In the third hour...
[00:08:53.433 --> 00:09:08.666]  I have a former Huffington Post writer of many years who dared to link to an article by Paul Joseph Watson and a video that had over 4 million views looking into Hillary's health.
[00:09:08.786 --> 00:09:18.495]  Now, this has been covered on CNN, the video's been covered on Fox News, the video was first posted by DrudgeReport.com about a week and a half ago and since went viral.
[00:09:20.776 --> 00:09:23.518]  And it's been seen by tens of millions because it's been aired on network TV.
[00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:34.005]  But the writer at the Huffington Post, they had to be censored, they had to be fired, they had to be shut down for that because you dare not speak about Hillary Clinton's health.
[00:09:39.409 --> 00:09:42.551]  Now thematically, there's a lot of news to cover here today.
[00:09:43.712 --> 00:09:44.833]  But this is what's happening.
[00:09:45.453 --> 00:09:48.756]  We are seeing the emergence of the global government agenda.
[00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:57.795]  The robber barons of the 19th and 20th century are not establishing world government so they just run everything.
[00:09:59.356 --> 00:10:09.522]  They're control freaks and have a particular system they want to impose called technocracy in their own words for over a hundred years.
[00:10:10.602 --> 00:10:12.864]  And the technocracy is to impose
[00:10:13.973 --> 00:10:23.820]  The global philosophy of eugenics, but not the eugenics that is just one spectrum that has been taught in schools, but the true, full eugenics.
[00:10:25.661 --> 00:10:31.766]  Which is basically, you're animals, you are the Eloi, they are the Morlock.
[00:10:34.207 --> 00:10:34.547]  And H.G.
[00:10:34.587 --> 00:10:40.852]  Wells wrote non-fiction books admitting that that was an allegory for the ruling class and the general public.
[00:10:43.993 --> 00:10:45.034]  So is War of the Worlds.
[00:10:45.114 --> 00:10:48.076]  It's an allegory of the elite versus the people.
[00:10:48.776 --> 00:10:54.620]  Go read his book, The New World Order, or Things to Come, and you will understand.
[00:10:56.542 --> 00:11:11.392]  I would get up on air 15 years ago, I remember, and I had a copy of the textbook somewhere here around the office, and I would show TV viewers, I would read for radio listeners, but Calhoun Reader
[00:11:12.449 --> 00:11:13.109]  That's what it's called.
[00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:28.436]  It was being used at the University of Texas and hundreds of other universities around the United States that actually said, the trainer for social workers, that actually said the family belongs to an age of barbarism and must be eradicated.
[00:11:30.377 --> 00:11:32.658]  Now a few months ago there was another article out
[00:11:33.737 --> 00:11:45.826]  In mainstream news, and it was saying basically, well, we're going to allow the family for a while as a management group for the state, but parents will just be wards of the state and their children are wards.
[00:11:45.886 --> 00:11:47.087]  Just incredible.
[00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:54.553]  100% absolute cult level, total nightmare government.
[00:11:57.095 --> 00:11:58.036]  And I would read that.
[00:12:02.057 --> 00:12:05.739]  On air, and radio listeners would not believe me.
[00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:16.103]  That the University of Texas, miles from where I'm broadcasting, teaches the family is barbarous.
[00:12:18.384 --> 00:12:22.665]  And primitive, those are terms they use, page after page, and how it must be eradicated.
[00:12:25.567 --> 00:12:30.008]  Because it is in the parents passing knowledge down that we have all the ignorance of the world.
[00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:31.329]  No, that's humanity.
[00:12:32.298 --> 00:12:34.339]  And now the technocrats want that totally broken.
[00:12:36.121 --> 00:12:40.243]  Paul Joseph Watson has an article, I'm going to get to this first, then I'm going to get to the huge censorship taking place.
[00:12:40.263 --> 00:12:42.465]  This is just one part of the emergence on every front.
[00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:51.731]  Black Lives Matter, this is so apropos, vows to destroy the nuclear family.
[00:12:53.283 --> 00:12:56.766]  In favor of communitarian collective care.
[00:12:56.786 --> 00:12:59.689]  Remember, George W. Bush launched the communitarian movement.
[00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.150]  Everybody freaked out about it.
[00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.753]  It was informed because it means communities of communism.
[00:13:05.334 --> 00:13:07.336]  Now you have to understand, this isn't some fringe group.
[00:13:07.356 --> 00:13:11.200]  This is what George Soros funds, and I'm going to tie it in globally here in a moment.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:17.606]  What happened to the black community in the 1950s and 60s when on average, these are factual numbers,
[00:13:18.897 --> 00:13:25.622]  Black communities had the lowest illegitimacy in the United States of America.
[00:13:27.042 --> 00:13:27.743]  Who had the highest?
[00:13:28.704 --> 00:13:33.107]  Native American groups on reservations because they had been under government control.
[00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.870]  Government money comes in and says you can't have a man in the house.
[00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:42.933]  Within a few decades, we go from less than 5% of black homes
[00:13:46.021 --> 00:13:54.383]  Being single family, single parent, to 75% and now it's over 85% on average.
[00:13:56.323 --> 00:13:57.223]  Devastating numbers.
[00:13:57.283 --> 00:14:05.004]  We know if there's not a father or a mother in the house, either one, you are three times more likely to end up on drugs, four times more likely to end up in prison.
[00:14:05.505 --> 00:14:07.765]  You are going to earn massively less.
[00:14:08.525 --> 00:14:10.305]  You're probably not going to finish high school.
[00:14:10.385 --> 00:14:11.206]  We know this!
[00:14:11.746 --> 00:14:13.126]  And here's Black Lives Matter.
[00:14:13.857 --> 00:14:23.920]  The product of the brainwashing out here with their signs saying we are committed, this is from their website, to disrupting the Western prescribed nuclear family.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.321]  Now that's how humans operate from Japan to, that's how civilization operates.
[00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:40.185]  We are committed to disrupting, this is what they're doing, they admit it, the Western prescribed nuclear family structure required by supporting each other as extended families and villages.
[00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:56.862]  Everybody by themselves with a central government village system that can be changed any day, that collectively care for one another and especially our children, that means your children belong to the state, to the degree that the mother, parents and children are comfortable.
[00:15:00.264 --> 00:15:01.705]  Notice, don't mention men in that.
[00:15:02.566 --> 00:15:04.387]  And that's because the state wants you weak, women.
[00:15:04.407 --> 00:15:05.608]  They want you all alone.
[00:15:06.687 --> 00:15:17.756]  And they want the men to never become men so that you absolutely are disgusted with them and then they can put out the image of an uncaring, mindless, arrested development thug.
[00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:20.518]  Be they white, black, you name it, everybody sees it everywhere.
[00:15:21.038 --> 00:15:29.445]  A cynical, narcissistic, stupid, cowardly male that thinks having no responsibility, having no honor is powerful.
[00:15:31.887 --> 00:15:33.829]  That thinks an aura of arrogance
[00:15:35.595 --> 00:15:38.296]  And selfishness is a crown upon their head.
[00:15:39.037 --> 00:15:42.378]  This is the fall of the human species by design.
[00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:43.859]  Just as H.G.
[00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:47.821]  Wells, top futurist of the Fabian Social Society, said he would do.
[00:15:48.541 --> 00:15:50.282]  George Orwell was in the Fabians as well.
[00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:51.182]  Very elite.
[00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:53.263]  It was so evil, he wrote 1984 warning you.
[00:15:54.964 --> 00:16:06.196]  And wrote letters, publicly published, in newspapers saying his book was the reality of what he learned at the BBC, and in British intelligence, and in the Foreign Secret Service.
[00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:09.859]  And he was dead less than a year it came out.
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.382]  I'm telling you that again, you read that book!
[00:16:14.246 --> 00:16:20.453]  Not to make us stronger, not to make us better, to end the family, to take children from their parents like you take eggs from a hen.
[00:16:20.693 --> 00:16:21.293]  Those are quotes.
[00:16:21.834 --> 00:16:23.256]  North Korea actually does it.
[00:16:23.516 --> 00:16:25.278]  Why is it the same program all over the world?
[00:16:25.498 --> 00:16:27.520]  Run by fascists, run by communists, run by corporatists.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.662]  Because it's a plan to end us!
[00:16:30.683 --> 00:16:33.867]  To turn us into animals like factory-farmed chickens or pigs!
[00:16:34.447 --> 00:16:35.929]  And if we act like it, we deserve it.
[00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:45.551]  Now, they know that at the point of this global government emerging, they're not going to be able to hide it anymore.
[00:16:46.692 --> 00:16:51.134]  For decades, they denied any of this was happening, any of this was going on.
[00:16:51.574 --> 00:16:55.716]  You go back 60 years, everything Barry Goldwater wrote has become true.
[00:16:56.276 --> 00:16:58.517]  Not because he was a rocket scientist, he was smart.
[00:17:00.626 --> 00:17:14.036]  But because he was in the Senate intelligence meetings where they were telling him, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, all came in and submitted reports to Congress, and Congress followed their every word.
[00:17:14.256 --> 00:17:20.500]  We are under a planetary program that the United States with England launched against the globe.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.801]  And you gotta hand it to them.
[00:17:21.981 --> 00:17:23.883]  They're running the whole show, baby!
[00:17:26.965 --> 00:17:28.366]  While sucking us dry to build it.
[00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:32.487]  See, you don't ignore this if you're a new viewer or listener.
[00:17:32.647 --> 00:17:33.788]  This is fact!
[00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:37.950]  This is a program.
[00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:38.731]  It's not my opinion.
[00:17:38.771 --> 00:17:39.812]  I'll use the allegory again.
[00:17:40.072 --> 00:17:57.343]  It's like cops busting in to the serial killer's house because they found a dead body in their car and they go down and there's videotapes, VHS tapes of them torturing 20, 30, 40 different women and chopping them up and burying them under the floorboards and then a journal how he did it, when he did it, when he picked them up.
[00:17:57.643 --> 00:17:58.564]  It's open and shut.
[00:17:59.564 --> 00:18:04.811]  I have to sit here, metaphorically, every day, digging up more of the bodies.
[00:18:05.012 --> 00:18:05.793]  They don't even hide them.
[00:18:06.213 --> 00:18:08.396]  And then I get to tell the public what's going on.
[00:18:08.536 --> 00:18:09.638]  People go, oh, that's your opinion.
[00:18:09.918 --> 00:18:11.480]  No, this is not my opinion.
[00:18:14.504 --> 00:18:15.005]  Let me continue.
[00:18:17.861 --> 00:18:22.682]  Remember 20 years ago the Patriots said they want to break up the family and they want to hurt your kids and they want to make us all poor?
[00:18:22.922 --> 00:18:24.303]  Oh shut up you conspiracy loon!
[00:18:24.563 --> 00:18:28.304]  Now they just go on MSNBC and say your kids don't belong to you.
[00:18:28.324 --> 00:18:29.764]  We need to break through that notion.
[00:18:29.784 --> 00:18:30.945]  It belongs to all of us.
[00:18:31.365 --> 00:18:34.606]  But see first they said don't discipline your own kids and don't have your neighbors disciplined.
[00:18:34.626 --> 00:18:36.386]  They actually ended that real village community.
[00:18:36.626 --> 00:18:37.787]  They mean the state community.
[00:18:38.027 --> 00:18:39.167]  Because there is a village community.
[00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:40.808]  But they create a counterfeit on top of that.
[00:18:40.968 --> 00:18:41.828]  But the village community
[00:18:42.728 --> 00:18:57.901]  It's like if the cops, when my dad was growing up, caught... My dad wasn't really a delinquent or anything, but, you know, if his brother, I guess, got caught stealing watermelons just for fun, the cops would just beat you up.
[00:18:58.581 --> 00:19:00.803]  And, by the way, tell your parents that they did it.
[00:19:00.823 --> 00:19:02.064]  They wouldn't beat you too hard.
[00:19:02.324 --> 00:19:06.768]  But the whole point is, that's because you're going to get hurt even worse the next time you do something a little worse.
[00:19:06.988 --> 00:19:08.830]  They take all the authority out of the local area,
[00:19:10.148 --> 00:19:16.690]  They put it right to the central system, chaos breaks out, and then the central system that has the monopoly on the authority comes in to take over.
[00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.611]  I'm skipping this break because we're not going to even have a show soon if this continues.
[00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:29.114]  So we have to just absolutely sacrifice and illustrate blood, sweat, treasure, tears here on air to illustrate to you how dire the straits are.
[00:19:30.441 --> 00:19:33.643]  It's like when 9-11 happened for days, they didn't run radio ads.
[00:19:33.663 --> 00:19:34.024]  Remember that?
[00:19:34.064 --> 00:19:36.466]  Because it wouldn't be proper to do during an emergency.
[00:19:36.586 --> 00:19:39.568]  I don't even know how we're supposed to run ads during this long emergency.
[00:19:39.968 --> 00:19:45.793]  It's like, not freaking out on air, not getting animated, ads into everybody's trance.
[00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:47.934]  We should all be freaking out over this.
[00:19:48.615 --> 00:19:50.436]  Let's play Melissa Harris Perry, remember?
[00:19:50.816 --> 00:19:52.758]  Saying, your kids don't belong to you.
[00:19:55.089 --> 00:19:55.449]  From MSNBC.
[00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:02.652]  We have never invested as much in public education as we should have because we've always had kind of a private notion of children.
[00:20:02.773 --> 00:20:06.014]  Your kid is yours and totally your responsibility.
[00:20:06.334 --> 00:20:09.596]  We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children.
[00:20:09.836 --> 00:20:17.739]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:23.122]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[00:20:25.458 --> 00:20:29.300]  And notice, they take your money, they give you jobs where it's hard to pay for everything.
[00:20:29.961 --> 00:20:34.563]  Your kid's in front of TV all day, they're eating bad food, all these dyes, all these chemicals, they're acting bad.
[00:20:34.643 --> 00:20:35.844]  Mom wants to go out at night.
[00:20:36.124 --> 00:20:38.286]  She wants to leave them at the gymnasium until 8 or 9.
[00:20:39.246 --> 00:20:41.527]  But see, now your children are totally raised by the state.
[00:20:42.328 --> 00:20:48.932]  And now the final phase is coming in, and they have George Soros funding black groups
[00:20:51.394 --> 00:20:58.536]  That are actually asking for a return to slavery where there weren't even men in the household, and the women were brought into the house, and the men were kept out in the barn.
[00:20:59.437 --> 00:21:04.258]  Now the men are kept in the prison, or in the state system, and the women come and get jobs with the state.
[00:21:04.578 --> 00:21:07.679]  They have just recreated the Roman Empire slave system.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.920]  You're thinking, wait, I thought you were talking about black people.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:16.962]  That was just an extension of the Roman plantation system, which had people of every color and creed.
[00:21:19.457 --> 00:21:25.060]  In fact, black slaves were more expensive, if you read the histories, and harder to get, so they were more prestigious in Rome.
[00:21:25.981 --> 00:21:31.664]  It was mainly folks from Gaul and Germania and other areas that were the cheaper slaves.
[00:21:31.885 --> 00:21:38.789]  But see, the general public doesn't know all this, so you're looking at actual slavery being brought in as a right.
[00:21:39.429 --> 00:21:42.151]  And they're saying, we are dedicated, we are committed.
[00:21:43.291 --> 00:21:43.791]  That's the quote.
[00:21:43.831 --> 00:21:56.795]  We are committed to disrupting the Western prescribed nuclear family structure required by supporting each other as extended families and villages that collectively care for one another and especially our children to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.
[00:21:59.876 --> 00:22:02.276]  And they will define what you're comfortable with in a collective.
[00:22:04.037 --> 00:22:04.177]  So.
[00:22:05.734 --> 00:22:07.216]  That's what's being vomited out.
[00:22:07.256 --> 00:22:08.097]  That's what's being spewed.
[00:22:08.157 --> 00:22:10.661]  Now, let me get into the big theme that we see emerge.
[00:22:11.322 --> 00:22:13.024]  Because I don't come here with my theme every day.
[00:22:13.044 --> 00:22:15.227]  I look at what the globalists are doing and I cover that theme.
[00:22:15.408 --> 00:22:16.789]  Let me just give you some headlines here.
[00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.073]  An internet giveaway to the UN.
[00:22:19.133 --> 00:22:19.894]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:22:20.984 --> 00:22:22.165]  They actually got the documents.
[00:22:22.785 --> 00:22:25.668]  It's going to happen in less than two months, and it actually gives the UN control.
[00:22:26.048 --> 00:22:26.408]  And guess what?
[00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:30.831]  The UN says they're going to censor everybody, as Facebook and others are already doing in Europe.
[00:22:31.512 --> 00:22:37.316]  In fact, Facebook is being recruited to run the program intergovernmentally as an NGO.
[00:22:38.197 --> 00:22:43.581]  Oh, and then the next article, that's Wall Street Journal, Daily Caller, just as of today.
[00:22:45.482 --> 00:22:48.625]  Soros document, undisputed.
[00:22:50.177 --> 00:22:53.060]  Regulate internet to favor open society supporters.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.521]  Give them the traffic.
[00:22:54.561 --> 00:22:55.442]  Give them the support.
[00:22:55.502 --> 00:22:56.643]  Give them the advertisers.
[00:22:56.943 --> 00:22:57.864]  Let them operate.
[00:22:57.924 --> 00:22:58.965]  Let them have businesses.
[00:22:59.205 --> 00:23:00.146]  Let them have shops.
[00:23:00.826 --> 00:23:03.428]  Back when he first was aiding the Nazis.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:14.709]  In Eastern Europe, as a teenager, first the people they were suppressing, whether it was Jews and many other groups, they wouldn't let you have your shop operate anymore.
[00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:20.073]  You had to go be poor now and sell your house to them for nothing and then move on to the ghetto after that.
[00:23:20.133 --> 00:23:21.735]  First they made you poor to control you.
[00:23:22.415 --> 00:23:23.396]  Where have I heard of that before?
[00:23:26.099 --> 00:23:28.721]  Just like they've doubled black unemployment under Obama in eight years.
[00:23:28.781 --> 00:23:29.842]  See, it's a program.
[00:23:31.713 --> 00:23:35.035]  And then they start shutting you off economically when you can't operate.
[00:23:35.576 --> 00:23:38.317]  Oh, they won't let Christians or conservative groups have 501c3s.
[00:23:38.497 --> 00:23:40.279]  They won't let veterans groups have 501c3s.
[00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:43.020]  They won't let libertarian groups have 501c3s.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:47.803]  They won't let law enforcement fraternal organizations that are patriotic have 501c3s.
[00:23:48.244 --> 00:23:51.126]  First, they won't let you have access to the tax exemption.
[00:23:51.326 --> 00:23:52.486]  Then they start auditing you.
[00:23:52.506 --> 00:23:53.627]  They start persecuting you.
[00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:56.729]  And MSNBC gets up there and says, you deserve it, Tea Party.
[00:23:56.829 --> 00:23:57.550]  You're racist.
[00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:59.231]  We just dehumanized you.
[00:24:02.364 --> 00:24:08.166]  And they go on to say, shut down the freedom of expression and only allow our NGOs to operate.
[00:24:08.546 --> 00:24:09.847]  Go read the document for yourself.
[00:24:10.967 --> 00:24:17.570]  Now, Pope Francis has been meeting with Zuckerberg, AP reports, to help push their agenda.
[00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.751]  Now that dovetails with this, doesn't it?
[00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:23.152]  DNC website down.
[00:24:23.332 --> 00:24:25.913]  Twitter suspended after releasing Soros docs.
[00:24:26.613 --> 00:24:28.654]  Oh, that website gets shut down.
[00:24:28.754 --> 00:24:29.795]  Twitter works in unison.
[00:24:29.835 --> 00:24:31.015]  You gotta silence them all.
[00:24:31.355 --> 00:24:32.636]  Shuts down their Twitter.
[00:24:34.537 --> 00:24:36.198]  See, it's already operating.
[00:24:36.218 --> 00:24:36.978]  Already.
[00:24:37.158 --> 00:24:40.239]  Oh, you release those documents and then George Soros.
[00:24:40.299 --> 00:24:41.440]  Make sure it gets shut down.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.601]  And DC Leaks wasn't big enough for it to get any attention.
[00:24:44.565 --> 00:24:46.086]  They should have been sending us the info, but that's fine.
[00:24:46.106 --> 00:24:46.967]  They sent it to WikiLeaks.
[00:24:47.007 --> 00:24:47.447]  That's great.
[00:24:48.008 --> 00:24:49.589]  WikiLeaks has enough clout to get it out.
[00:24:49.829 --> 00:24:50.990]  The media is forced to cover it.
[00:24:51.731 --> 00:24:53.992]  And oh, the crimes they talk about in there.
[00:24:54.192 --> 00:24:54.993]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:24:55.033 --> 00:24:56.294]  Just, I've got stacks of these.
[00:24:56.694 --> 00:24:57.375]  Not even looking.
[00:24:57.715 --> 00:24:58.135]  Stacks.
[00:24:59.456 --> 00:24:59.677]  Stacks.
[00:24:59.697 --> 00:25:04.340]  Remember Dr. Drew, less than a week after it hit show on Headline News?
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.282]  He comes out and says, I care about Hillary.
[00:25:06.782 --> 00:25:10.365]  Man, she's, the medicines they say they're giving her and her medical records that they put out.
[00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:22.930]  and uh... thyroid uh... armor thyroid from the sixties have been given since then this is this would kill you this doesn't make sense i'd like to talk to her talk to her doctors i want to help her.
[00:25:23.211 --> 00:25:23.511]  Boom!
[00:25:23.531 --> 00:25:24.231]  You're fired!
[00:25:26.373 --> 00:25:30.156]  They got control of CNN after all it is the Clinton News Network.
[00:25:32.017 --> 00:25:32.938]  Isn't that just special?
[00:25:32.978 --> 00:25:36.681]  We have that reporter joining us coming up in the third hour.
[00:25:37.662 --> 00:25:40.064]  The Huffington Post has sensationally censored an article
[00:25:41.445 --> 00:25:43.265]  Let me ask real liberals a question, because I know you're out there.
[00:26:10.532 --> 00:26:12.852]  You were the folks that marched with me against the Iraq War.
[00:26:13.333 --> 00:26:17.293]  You were the folks that supported, you know, us against, you know, lying about WMDs.
[00:26:18.174 --> 00:26:22.154]  I mean, you're the type of people that I disagree with on some issues, but you're not bloodthirsty fascists.
[00:26:26.595 --> 00:26:34.157]  Do you understand that if you go to the Wall Street Journal or even the New York Times or the Washington Post, but even the Wall Street Journal, you'll have 50 articles
[00:26:36.668 --> 00:26:37.769]  60 articles this weekend.
[00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:39.510]  I saw them CNN's front page, over 100 articles.
[00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:45.174]  And there were 60 plus, I counted them up, that were on Trump and all of them were negative.
[00:26:45.975 --> 00:26:46.435]  All of them.
[00:26:47.796 --> 00:26:48.897]  This isn't even about Trump.
[00:26:49.037 --> 00:26:53.820]  It's the unified control of the dinosaur media and everyone in lockstep.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.181]  This is shameful!
[00:26:56.702 --> 00:26:58.303]  They're getting ready for new banker bailouts.
[00:26:58.343 --> 00:26:59.044]  It's being announced.
[00:26:59.064 --> 00:27:00.405]  New looting of the taxpayers.
[00:27:02.142 --> 00:27:03.122]  They'll all go along with it.
[00:27:03.702 --> 00:27:26.307]  They'll go along with any new wars the establishment starts, and they'll go along with intensified persecution of anyone that's pro-America, anyone that isn't a traitor, anyone that doesn't want race war, anyone that doesn't want to shoot cops in the back of the head when they're changing tires or pumping gas, anyone who isn't a mindless scumbag servant of George Soros.
[00:27:27.554 --> 00:27:30.616]  We are in such incredible peril right now.
[00:27:31.277 --> 00:27:37.161]  And the stacks go on and on and on with the censorship now happening.
[00:27:37.561 --> 00:27:38.862]  People say, well, how are you still on air?
[00:27:39.342 --> 00:27:43.125]  Google will not let me sell my films or have a shopping cart for seven years.
[00:27:43.165 --> 00:27:45.207]  They said, you made a film called Obama Deception.
[00:27:45.327 --> 00:27:45.967]  It is racist.
[00:27:46.087 --> 00:27:46.768]  You are banned.
[00:27:47.308 --> 00:27:48.849]  I am banned from commerce.
[00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:51.451]  On Google, the biggest platform in the world.
[00:27:52.952 --> 00:27:54.053]  Oh, people say, so what?
[00:27:54.233 --> 00:27:55.314]  See, it's going to hit you next.
[00:27:57.056 --> 00:28:00.357]  And they're going to go after everybody in the end, folks, and I could go on and on and on and on and on.
[00:28:00.417 --> 00:28:08.898]  We have so many platforms, and we're on close to 200 AM and FM affiliates, TV stations, cable, you name it, that we've got a big enough presence that we're hard to go after.
[00:28:09.098 --> 00:28:11.198]  They had to infiltrate and take Fox over from within.
[00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:18.180]  They tried to do boycotts on Limbaugh and had him, you know, basically falsely arrested and all that other crap.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:26.201]  This is the type, I mean, they're not plain, folks, if I told you, and I don't want to be dramatic here, and it doesn't bother me, I expect it to happen,
[00:28:28.197 --> 00:28:30.078]  My life is like a James Bond movie, okay?
[00:28:30.158 --> 00:28:33.820]  I have dealt with stuff you couldn't believe, okay?
[00:28:35.922 --> 00:28:37.122]  You've seen what's happened here on air.
[00:28:37.162 --> 00:28:38.003]  You see what we do.
[00:28:39.624 --> 00:28:50.430]  And it's only because we have the will to do it and built a platform to resist, and there are a lot of patriots in the government and in corporate systems that appreciate what we're doing and are helping us, and you out there, the listeners, in your prayers.
[00:28:50.491 --> 00:28:54.213]  But you have to understand, it's not hyperbole, it's not rhetoric, it's not hype.
[00:28:56.007 --> 00:28:58.270]  We have outrageous levels of evil.
[00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:02.935]  We have Obama persecuting more journalists than all presidents in US history combined.
[00:29:04.416 --> 00:29:11.304]  Whistleblowers who report serious crime are arrested and thrown in maximum security prisons.
[00:29:12.465 --> 00:29:15.789]  Evil is moving against the world.
[00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:27.055]  Our government destabilized scores of non-radical Muslim nations and put the most horrible, bloodthirsty jihadis in control to murder every Christian and non-radical Islam person they could.
[00:29:28.156 --> 00:29:29.016]  They call them heretics.
[00:29:29.397 --> 00:29:30.517]  Alawites, Shiites, and others.
[00:29:30.537 --> 00:29:30.897]  They kill them.
[00:29:31.498 --> 00:29:32.118]  Hundreds of thousands.
[00:29:32.378 --> 00:29:34.659]  Hillary makes jokes about, I came, I saw, he died.
[00:29:34.719 --> 00:29:37.521]  Marilyn Albright says, I don't care if 500,000 Iraqi kids die.
[00:29:37.761 --> 00:29:39.442]  These are bloodthirsty monsters.
[00:29:40.302 --> 00:29:41.063]  And they're moving.
[00:29:41.623 --> 00:29:42.904]  Hillary puts out a fundraiser.
[00:29:44.265 --> 00:29:45.365]  Press release two weeks ago.
[00:29:45.725 --> 00:29:46.426]  Didn't even hide it.
[00:29:47.225 --> 00:29:49.587]  And says, Reitbart doesn't have a right to exist.
[00:29:49.627 --> 00:29:51.128]  Neither does the alt-conservative media.
[00:29:51.148 --> 00:29:52.710]  We're gonna shut it down when I get in.
[00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:57.954]  Then she gives a speech last week and names yours truly as enemy number one, basically.
[00:29:59.675 --> 00:30:00.556]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.056 --> 00:30:02.658]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.579 --> 00:30:06.281]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.848 --> 00:30:17.191]  The official Black Lives Matter website vows to destroy the nuclear family and replace it with communist-style collective parenting.
[00:30:17.331 --> 00:30:18.772]  Black Lives Matter says, quote,
[00:30:28.157 --> 00:30:32.260]  And especially our children to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:40.127]  Paul Joseph Watson points out that the notion of collective communities being responsible for children and not parents is an idea that has been pushed by the leftist establishment before.
[00:30:40.307 --> 00:30:45.731]  Most notably by MSNBC's Melissa Harris Perry in which she claimed the notion that kids belonging to their parents was outdated.
[00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:55.679]  The Black Lives Matter pledge is a reminder that the movement funded by billionaire socialist George Soros is actually a Marxist front meant to sabotage western values more so than stopping police abuse.
[00:30:55.959 --> 00:31:05.503]  Instead of encouraging strong parenting in the black community, Black Lives Matter is telling parents that the traditional nuclear family is a bad idea, and that they should give up control of their children.

[00:31:08.624 --> 00:31:09.944]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:31:10.424 --> 00:31:19.488]  If you can't see the irony in having a gun ban enforced by men with guns, well then you fail to understand why the Second Amendment was written in the first place.
[00:31:19.548 --> 00:31:22.369]  Throughout history, only slaves are disarmed.
[00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:26.272]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[00:31:26.392 --> 00:31:27.513]  The right of the people.
[00:31:27.593 --> 00:31:28.734]  The right of the people.
[00:31:28.794 --> 00:31:29.714]  The right of the people.
[00:31:29.794 --> 00:31:32.236]  To keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:31:32.276 --> 00:31:41.143]  For all of you actors out there who go to your red carpet events surrounded by full battle rattle SWAT teams while you accept your awards for your latest violent movie.
[00:31:41.463 --> 00:31:42.644]  I have a strict gun control policy.
[00:31:42.664 --> 00:31:44.764]  If there's a gun around, I want to control it.
[00:31:44.824 --> 00:31:45.705]  Clint Eastwood.
[00:31:45.745 --> 00:31:45.925]  Go ahead.
[00:31:46.005 --> 00:31:46.505]  Make my day.
[00:31:46.525 --> 00:31:49.346]  Dads demand guns because it's me that's got to get up and go check out that noise at 2am.
[00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:49.806]  Infowars.com
[00:32:10.498 --> 00:32:19.503]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:19.603 --> 00:32:27.707]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:27.987 --> 00:32:32.689]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:32.869 --> 00:32:39.572]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:39.652 --> 00:32:46.734]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:32:46.814 --> 00:32:53.697]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:32:53.857 --> 00:32:58.202]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:32:58.342 --> 00:33:01.605]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:33:01.726 --> 00:33:07.872]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.

[00:33:23.442 --> 00:33:29.737]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:56.889 --> 00:34:09.141]  I tell you, I know everybody out there is basically starting to have a light bulb go on above their head and realize, oh my God, this whole world government's really real.
[00:34:10.102 --> 00:34:20.172]  And at the bottom of the world government rat hole is basically a big, fat, diseased moray eel that feasts on civilizations and innocent people.
[00:34:21.223 --> 00:34:31.725]  This whole thing's being set up as a giant power trip for very, very sick, very, very twisted globalist interests that do not have our best interests at heart.
[00:34:33.485 --> 00:34:38.706]  And they openly are saying, you can't have your family, you can't have your private property.
[00:34:40.467 --> 00:34:45.808]  A canary in the coal mine is all over the world, from South America to the United States,
[00:34:46.992 --> 00:34:52.257]  Amish and Mennonite communities are now being harassed, demonized, and attacked by central government.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.263]  They don't want anybody operating outside their system.
[00:34:59.403 --> 00:35:02.006]  By the way, the Amish and Mennonites do not have autism.
[00:35:04.349 --> 00:35:09.192]  Their cancer rates are incredibly lower, and it's because they don't use modern chemicals and pesticides.
[00:35:09.572 --> 00:35:20.199]  The elite can't have one group of rats in the laboratory that are not being poisoned, and the other rats right next door are all dying at half their age and disease with tumors all over.
[00:35:20.219 --> 00:35:26.003]  Because if the rats are humans, they got brains big enough to look over there at the Amish and go, something's going on.
[00:35:28.936 --> 00:35:29.576]  Got it, folks?
[00:35:30.157 --> 00:35:33.398]  The New World Order is here to kill you and your family.
[00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:37.560]  But first, dumb you down, make you sick, and suck everything out of you.
[00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:49.346]  And when people finally get it, that this has not been rhetoric or exaggeration, when you finally get it, is the minute we start turning the tide against these people.
[00:35:51.207 --> 00:35:56.610]  And I want to explain, the average person in government or corporations is just as compartmentalized as the public,
[00:35:57.412 --> 00:35:58.493]  And is not the enemy.
[00:35:58.893 --> 00:36:09.101]  It is the New World Order and the philosophy of the technotronic technocracy to enforce eugenics.
[00:36:11.582 --> 00:36:13.924]  Those are the words of Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:36:14.024 --> 00:36:15.605]  The words of Henry Kissinger.
[00:36:15.926 --> 00:36:17.567]  The words of Carol Quigley.
[00:36:17.927 --> 00:36:21.730]  The words of John P. Holdren.
[00:36:24.072 --> 00:36:25.513]  The words of the architects.
[00:36:27.483 --> 00:36:28.904]  Yes, you can have the blueprints.
[00:36:29.504 --> 00:36:31.946]  You gotta read what they wrote, though, to know it's real.
[00:36:32.527 --> 00:36:35.569]  You can't sit there in cognitive dissonance and say, oh, this guy's wild-eyed.
[00:36:35.869 --> 00:36:40.072]  How am I supposed to not be wild-eyed when they're on TV saying we're gonna get rid of the family?
[00:36:40.573 --> 00:36:45.216]  And they're incrementally raising taxes and regulations and control where it's almost impossible to have one?
[00:36:46.157 --> 00:36:50.160]  And they create cultural systems to make kids act as bad as they possibly can?
[00:36:52.625 --> 00:36:55.268]  I'm going to go back into the news and just get into so much.
[00:36:55.548 --> 00:37:03.135]  Briefly, we've never sold more of the Hillary for prison shirts, and I know why.
[00:37:03.176 --> 00:37:04.337]  We're selling them at cost.
[00:37:05.998 --> 00:37:07.400]  The shipping and handling is included $9.95.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.383]  In fact, on some of the 4Xs and stuff,
[00:37:13.728 --> 00:37:15.069]  There's some big boys out there buying them.
[00:37:15.089 --> 00:37:17.931]  We actually lose about a dollar on those because they do cost us more.
[00:37:18.171 --> 00:37:19.432]  The shirts have like twice the fabric.
[00:37:19.752 --> 00:37:25.896]  But on average it's at cost and I can only run this for another week or so but it is extremely popular.
[00:37:25.916 --> 00:37:38.185]  We're gonna go to another design soon so it's also limited edition and we're calling this the Dark Heart Special because Hillary Clinton came out of course last
[00:37:39.076 --> 00:37:45.000]  Thursday, and said that I have such a horrible, evil, dark heart because I don't trust her and don't like her.
[00:37:45.821 --> 00:37:46.902]  And so people are responding.
[00:37:46.922 --> 00:37:49.003]  We need to see Hillary for President shirts everywhere.
[00:37:51.305 --> 00:37:52.386]  We have millions of listeners.
[00:37:52.726 --> 00:38:00.092]  If millions of you would order the shirts instead of 100,000 or whatever have done it, imagine the effect that would have.
[00:38:00.872 --> 00:38:08.258]  And I would just have a third-party clearinghouse actually ship it at that point if we start selling hundreds of thousands a month instead of hundreds of thousands in a year.
[00:38:09.688 --> 00:38:11.549]  We need to put millions of these out.
[00:38:11.669 --> 00:38:12.389]  We can do it.
[00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:13.170]  We're ready.
[00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:25.295]  If every one of you just says, I'm getting a Hillary for Prison shirt at cost, and maybe buys two or three more to give to friends and family and others, we can really send a hardcore message that's already shaken up the globalists and shaken up Hillary.
[00:38:27.356 --> 00:38:32.478]  After all, you know, Hillary just had to hold her heart when she talked about how horrible and dark my heart is.
[00:38:34.824 --> 00:38:44.447]  What happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs?
[00:38:45.707 --> 00:38:50.628]  He even said, and this really just is so disgusting.
[00:38:50.948 --> 00:38:51.348]  Oh yeah.
[00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:56.550]  He even said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors.
[00:38:57.446 --> 00:39:00.148]  And no one was actually killed there.
[00:39:00.248 --> 00:39:10.097]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:39:11.198 --> 00:39:13.440]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:18.804]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing.
[00:39:18.905 --> 00:39:20.206]  I will not let you down.
[00:39:22.122 --> 00:39:25.384]  This from the man who wants to be President of the United States.
[00:39:25.404 --> 00:39:26.684]  All right, let's stop right there.
[00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:34.868]  I'm going to go to the latest Trump clip in a moment where he talks about the NSA has their emails.
[00:39:34.888 --> 00:39:37.929]  Well, we have the former head of the NSA on the show, so Trump's right.
[00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:41.251]  And I have other clips, but I want to play a clip in a moment.
[00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:45.613]  It's the Goblin clip to show you how they can take something out of context and twist it.
[00:39:47.572 --> 00:39:52.078]  9-11 was an inside job in the criminal elements of our government working with the Saudis and others.
[00:39:52.098 --> 00:40:00.227]  In order to stand down on 9-11, we do not know the exact specifics of what happened, but we know that high-level whistleblowers have come on this show.
[00:40:01.201 --> 00:40:01.581]  I don't know.
[00:40:20.106 --> 00:40:25.269]  Oklahoma City was a false flag, absolutely, with bombs inside the building, with a patsy out front.
[00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:27.310]  We have the local news showing the bombs being taken out.
[00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:31.632]  I've interviewed the police officers that had the feds come and threaten to kill them, Don Browning and others.
[00:40:31.672 --> 00:40:32.272]  They didn't shut up.
[00:40:32.332 --> 00:40:33.232]  Some cops got killed.
[00:40:34.213 --> 00:40:37.674]  That is a true statement, our only true statement, that I said that is a pure false flag.
[00:40:38.455 --> 00:40:42.617]  I went and searched this weekend to find where they were getting this, and they did edit together a clip.
[00:40:43.562 --> 00:40:46.404]  I say, you know, I can't believe they just have actors and not kill kids.
[00:40:46.765 --> 00:40:55.311]  I mean, I know there was a blue screen with Anderson Cooper, and they might have had some adults that were actors because they've been caught doing that before, but I, you know, I can't believe that they didn't, you know, kill any, you know, kids at this thing.
[00:40:55.331 --> 00:40:56.973]  I mean, there are real mass shootings sometimes.
[00:40:57.333 --> 00:41:03.658]  Statistically, they're not that common, but I said, man, look at the kids going in circles in and out of the building, you know, during this drill.
[00:41:03.738 --> 00:41:04.519]  It looks like a drill.
[00:41:04.559 --> 00:41:05.900]  I mean, yeah, I guess they could have been actors.
[00:41:06.906 --> 00:41:08.006]  That's a hypothetical statement.
[00:41:08.026 --> 00:41:09.287]  But the point is, I don't run from that.
[00:41:09.687 --> 00:41:11.087]  You guys lied about WMDs.
[00:41:11.127 --> 00:41:15.628]  You guys bomb aspirin factories when Clinton's about to be impeached to divert people.
[00:41:15.989 --> 00:41:20.010]  You lied about Serbia and who started that whole war and bombed them twice.
[00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.170]  And then engaged in all these other crimes.
[00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.371]  And talk about, you went to Libya, you came, you saw, he died.
[00:41:26.111 --> 00:41:31.693]  Sixty, seventy-something thousand people dead with the jihadis you brought in killing
[00:41:33.877 --> 00:41:34.818]  Men, women, and children.
[00:41:35.378 --> 00:41:39.960]  So you sit there, talking about how I'm evil and I'm bloodthirsty, twisting what I've said.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.001]  It's truly disgusting.
[00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:46.083]  But here's an example of how they twist something.
[00:41:46.583 --> 00:41:53.687]  I used a Lord of the Rings analogy, and I said, you know, Trump's going to get dirty fighting these goblin-like creatures.
[00:41:55.083 --> 00:41:57.705]  And he's got to go down a goblin nest and fight some.
[00:41:57.725 --> 00:42:04.609]  He might get some goblin guts, goblet vomit on him, goblet blood, but I don't want to catch him in bed with a goblin or kissing a goblin.
[00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:13.774]  They went on all over the news, TV, newspapers, you name it, and said Alex Jones is worried about Donald Trump having sex with goblins.
[00:42:14.235 --> 00:42:15.776]  And people can say, Alex, watch what you say.
[00:42:15.816 --> 00:42:16.976]  They can spin it or twist it.
[00:42:17.457 --> 00:42:18.317]  That's what they do.
[00:42:18.357 --> 00:42:19.458]  It's why they're discredited.
[00:42:21.041 --> 00:42:23.605]  I'm not reading off a teleprompter and I don't apologize for it.
[00:42:23.706 --> 00:42:26.630]  Trump always said they make it really hard for legal people to come here.
[00:42:28.129 --> 00:42:31.111]  I will make it easier, as long as you're vetted and don't have a criminal record.
[00:42:32.391 --> 00:42:34.513]  You'll have to go out and then come right back in.
[00:42:34.573 --> 00:42:36.074]  But if you're a felon, we're going to throw you out.
[00:42:36.094 --> 00:42:39.716]  There's a lot of bad people coming in from Mexico and other areas, a lot of big problems.
[00:42:40.496 --> 00:42:43.178]  They turn that into he hates Mexicans and is going to kick everybody out.
[00:42:43.518 --> 00:42:48.681]  Then he comes out and, again, restates what he always said, and they say he flip-flops.
[00:42:48.841 --> 00:42:50.742]  This is how they deceive.
[00:42:51.142 --> 00:42:54.004]  And it's the public's fault for being gullible about this.
[00:42:55.064 --> 00:42:55.845]  Not Donald Trump's.
[00:42:56.894 --> 00:42:59.376]  But again, this is a popular vine, they call it.
[00:42:59.396 --> 00:43:06.941]  It's less than 10 seconds on the internet that I think 5 million people have watched this on one channel alone on YouTube.
[00:43:06.961 --> 00:43:10.083]  And so in a way, all it does is make me really famous.
[00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:12.596]  I'm kind of like the meme king now.
[00:43:12.616 --> 00:43:32.847]  And then everybody comes and finds the real show and finds out that it's articulate, focused, interesting guests from Sy Hirst, the Pulitzer Prize winner, to Daniel Ellsberg, the Pentagon Papers, to Ron Paul, to Donald Trump, to Jesse Ventura, who's coming on in the next hour, to world leaders, the former head of the German CIA, Andres von Bulow, coming on and agreeing with me about 9-11.
[00:43:33.427 --> 00:43:35.148]  I mean, this is a serious broadcast.
[00:43:35.648 --> 00:43:36.889]  Journalists that are being censored.
[00:43:37.169 --> 00:43:38.510]  Constitutional law professors.
[00:43:39.281 --> 00:43:42.044]  And then I have little entertaining stories, or I attempt to make them entertaining.
[00:43:44.687 --> 00:43:56.801]  Just like I play Caddyshack clips, where they fake open the bottle, and then I show her fake opening the jar of pickles, and then, you know, I make a joke out of it and they say I'm completely serious.
[00:43:58.102 --> 00:44:00.465]  I'm not discredited, they're discredited.
[00:44:02.093 --> 00:44:03.134]  The numbers show that.
[00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:05.196]  New media is incredibly trusted.
[00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:06.777]  Old media isn't trusted.
[00:44:07.178 --> 00:44:09.660]  And new media is trusted because of its true diversity.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.742]  And that's why they're coming to try to censor it all.
[00:44:12.302 --> 00:44:13.944]  Here's an example of them editing clips.
[00:44:14.724 --> 00:44:20.770]  Trump charging into a goblin's nest, kissing goblins, goblin vomit, catching him in bed with a goblin.
[00:44:23.352 --> 00:44:27.576]  And it's pretty ridiculous, but I'm told you can't just watch it once.
[00:44:27.636 --> 00:44:28.477]  Let's watch it one more time.
[00:44:30.888 --> 00:44:36.939]  Trump charging into a goblin's nest, kissing goblins, goblin vomit, catch him in bed with a goblin.
[00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:40.847]  All right, so that sounds crazy.
[00:44:41.808 --> 00:44:42.550]  They edited it in a 10-minute
[00:44:44.471 --> 00:44:45.792]  Allegory, I told.
[00:44:46.573 --> 00:44:48.354]  And I'm not claiming I'm the smartest guy around.
[00:44:48.394 --> 00:44:51.197]  Sometimes what I say I think is pretty darn interesting and informative.
[00:44:51.497 --> 00:44:53.178]  Sometimes it's a train wreck, but it's real.
[00:44:53.819 --> 00:44:56.761]  But then they had all these big esoteric publications and news sites.
[00:44:57.201 --> 00:44:58.743]  This is incredibly sophisticated.
[00:44:59.103 --> 00:45:07.630]  He said he doesn't want Trump having political succubus with Hillary and selling out to her under the table, but he doesn't think that's what's happening.
[00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:15.992]  And then I gave the whole goblin allegory, and then they turned it all into this big kabbalistic analysis of what I was saying, but it wasn't kabbalistic.
[00:45:16.572 --> 00:45:27.874]  All that archetypal ancient worldview systems are all basically the same, and so my gestalt of an archetype obviously would fit into a kabbalistic rendering.
[00:45:28.234 --> 00:45:31.995]  But really what it is, is just spoken word.
[00:45:33.029 --> 00:45:33.909]  That they then distort.
[00:45:34.749 --> 00:46:01.594]  But I'll put my spoken word up any day against all these little mental midgets that spend days crafting disinformation articles and editing videos together so they can sycophantically, pseudo-intellectually, foppishly, I use that word a lot because it's so good, pretend that they're actually proving themselves better than I.
[00:46:04.426 --> 00:46:08.690]  It's pretty easy to prove globalists wrong because they're always lying to the public.
[00:46:10.511 --> 00:46:13.214]  All they have is the confidence game that they put on.
[00:46:13.254 --> 00:46:14.034]  But I digress.
[00:46:14.775 --> 00:46:18.678]  Briefly, get the Hillary for President shirt for $9.95.
[00:46:18.919 --> 00:46:19.919]  That includes the shipping.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:20.920]  Shirt costs us like $5.
[00:46:21.441 --> 00:46:22.061]  The shipping's about $5.
[00:46:22.201 --> 00:46:24.543]  It evens out in the wash.
[00:46:26.545 --> 00:46:30.008]  The problem is we're selling so many of these, I don't even know if my shipping department can handle it.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.668]  And the shirt's gonna sell out in the next few days.
[00:46:33.728 --> 00:46:35.174]  We're gonna get a new design in.
[00:46:35.415 --> 00:46:36.781]  It'll be similar, but a different variant.
[00:46:38.658 --> 00:46:40.259]  I have to say, it will not support the broadcast.
[00:46:40.279 --> 00:46:43.240]  It will just support the truth and exposing Hillary Clinton.
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:54.426]  If you want to support the broadcast, we have 20% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix, which is an amazing, again, bioavailable vitamin mineral supplement with cofactors, amino acids, and more.
[00:46:54.746 --> 00:46:56.407]  Fruit punch flavor, great for your children.
[00:46:56.867 --> 00:46:59.768]  This is a great way to actually absorb your multivitamin every day.
[00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:03.310]  Also, we have the new initial run of our BioTruth Selenium.
[00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:04.911]  Very, very absorbable.
[00:47:05.011 --> 00:47:07.112]  I cannot express to you enough how important
[00:47:07.372 --> 00:47:07.992]  Selenium is.
[00:47:08.032 --> 00:47:11.475]  Now most people from the research out there are deficient in it.
[00:47:12.295 --> 00:47:14.977]  It is key to electrochemical processes.
[00:47:15.057 --> 00:47:16.278]  In fact, I'm going to take one right now.
[00:47:16.318 --> 00:47:17.239]  I forgot to take one this weekend.
[00:47:17.259 --> 00:47:18.760]  I haven't taken a bottle of this home yet.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:23.243]  This is the very best selenium you're going to find from the mighty mustard seed.
[00:47:23.623 --> 00:47:29.567]  The tiniest of seeds grows a huge plant and it is powered basically by pure bioavailable selenium.
[00:47:29.587 --> 00:47:31.809]  And this in one pill is a nice dose.
[00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:33.289]  You take two a day.
[00:47:33.329 --> 00:47:35.010]  I mean, I get amazing energy from this.
[00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:46.293]  So, again, folks, check that out today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:47:47.153 --> 00:47:50.574]  But Hillary for Prison at Cost, also the new American film.
[00:47:50.654 --> 00:47:52.274]  You can get a free bottle of Coil Silver.
[00:47:52.454 --> 00:47:56.275]  When you get a second film, great to spread the word on that front as well.
[00:47:56.595 --> 00:47:58.236]  I'm going to stop plugging at that point.
[00:48:00.438 --> 00:48:19.492]  Kind of reset here and get back into the news, but I do want to also add the caveat that we have a lot of precious AM and FM affiliates out there, and if you're listening to us on AM station, FM station, UHF, VHF TV, cable, whatever the case may be, we're in desperate times, and people are also ready to wake up right now.
[00:48:19.772 --> 00:48:21.893]  It's best of times, worst of times scenario.
[00:48:21.933 --> 00:48:23.875]  As things get bad, people are now ready to wake up.
[00:48:25.076 --> 00:48:28.358]  All the things we've talked about, that you've talked about, that others have, is happening.
[00:48:29.773 --> 00:48:31.754]  Put a sign up in your yard for the local station.
[00:48:32.115 --> 00:48:33.155]  Paint the side of your barn.
[00:48:33.175 --> 00:48:34.516]  If you got money, pay for a billboard.
[00:48:34.556 --> 00:48:35.217]  Call the station.
[00:48:35.537 --> 00:48:36.718]  Work with them on it.
[00:48:36.738 --> 00:48:37.598]  Become a sponsor.
[00:48:37.638 --> 00:48:38.819]  Support the local sponsors.
[00:48:39.139 --> 00:48:40.400]  Send them 20 bucks in the mail.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.461]  If you got it, 100 bucks.
[00:48:41.941 --> 00:48:42.822]  We're in a war.
[00:48:43.543 --> 00:48:45.864]  And a lot of times when things start getting bad, people pull back.
[00:48:46.124 --> 00:48:46.845]  They lose everything.
[00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:50.151]  That's why I have hired more people.
[00:48:50.231 --> 00:48:52.132]  That's why I've gotten more serious up here at the office.
[00:48:52.152 --> 00:48:53.813]  That's why I've been working seven days a week.
[00:48:54.513 --> 00:48:56.234]  I'm now up here seven days a week right now.
[00:48:56.254 --> 00:49:00.856]  Now, I do allow myself, you know, I only come up here three, four hours on Saturday and Sundays.
[00:49:01.576 --> 00:49:05.678]  But I'm working part-time now on the weekend because I'm shooting more videos at night.
[00:49:05.718 --> 00:49:08.720]  Everybody sees it because now is the season to fight the tyranny.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:15.883]  And it's now is the time to support the affiliates and folks that are also supporting us and themselves.
[00:49:17.839 --> 00:49:20.800]  So much is going on and also pray for those local affiliates.
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:27.741]  And please pray for this broadcast because I shot a video and this is our next piece of news.
[00:49:29.701 --> 00:49:33.902]  I shot a video up here with Rob Dew on Saturday and it's a complex historical video.
[00:49:34.482 --> 00:49:36.542]  It took him until well into showtime the next day.
[00:49:36.562 --> 00:49:38.463]  I didn't even finish the video.
[00:49:38.563 --> 00:49:42.483]  It's 16 and a half minutes long and it's posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:49:43.284 --> 00:49:45.264]  Alex Jones asked Hillary not to kill him.
[00:49:46.124 --> 00:49:46.964]  Is the name of the article.
[00:49:47.564 --> 00:49:51.685]  The video posted on YouTube is titled, Hillary Please Stop Killing People.
[00:49:52.286 --> 00:49:54.526]  And I show her laughing, talking about killing people.
[00:49:54.546 --> 00:49:59.167]  Madeleine Albright talking about 500,000 dead Iraqis is a good price to pay.
[00:50:00.047 --> 00:50:01.388]  Many of their horrible crimes.
[00:50:01.788 --> 00:50:02.928]  Her threatening Obama.
[00:50:03.388 --> 00:50:04.128]  It goes on and on.
[00:50:05.929 --> 00:50:08.249]  Just to show you who's got the dark heart here.
[00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:09.410]  And let me explain something.
[00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:11.070]  I'm not a macho person.
[00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:14.591]  I don't go out and play chicken with people on the highway just to feel tough.
[00:50:15.785 --> 00:50:18.126]  I don't risk my name, my treasure, my sacred honor.
[00:50:19.206 --> 00:50:23.227]  If I don't think we can win, because I know we can win, if I didn't think we could win, I wouldn't do it.
[00:50:24.727 --> 00:50:26.608]  And I'm not just trying to mess with Hillary Clinton.
[00:50:27.428 --> 00:50:29.869]  She is a front person for a lot of more evil forces.
[00:50:31.929 --> 00:50:35.050]  And what she does is she kind of is famous for shooting the bat.
[00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:37.030]  I don't know.
[00:50:57.319 --> 00:51:09.281]  No, them taking over fully and having their will with everyone, with George Soros, the Nazi collaborator, is of such a concern that I'm willing to go up against this monster, and I know you are as well.
[00:51:10.421 --> 00:51:14.862]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:51:14.902 --> 00:51:25.844]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:51:26.004 --> 00:51:30.926]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:33.567]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:51:33.627 --> 00:51:35.128]  It helps detoxify.
[00:51:35.328 --> 00:51:38.169]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:51:38.229 --> 00:51:42.971]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:51:42.991 --> 00:51:49.234]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:51:49.274 --> 00:51:54.577]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:51:54.597 --> 00:51:55.337]  I'm taking it now.
[00:51:55.657 --> 00:51:56.097]  Every day.
[00:51:56.298 --> 00:51:57.018]  This is so key.
[00:51:57.278 --> 00:51:59.601]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[00:51:59.841 --> 00:52:01.562]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:52:01.602 --> 00:52:03.704]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:52:03.825 --> 00:52:07.288]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:52:10.635 --> 00:52:14.776]  The Huffington Post banned a journalist from writing about Hillary's health and even deleted his article.
[00:52:14.996 --> 00:52:19.698]  Journalist David Seaman pinned a commentary piece discussing questions surrounding Hillary's health on Sunday.
[00:52:19.838 --> 00:52:25.500]  The story even included a link to a viral InfoWars video about the subject, which has over 3.5 million views.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:32.442]  And as reported by Politico's Watson, the article was trending, yet the Huffington Post still deleted it within hours and even revoked Seaman's posting rights.
[00:52:32.602 --> 00:52:37.845]  The article now just contains an editor's note stating this post is no longer available on the Huffington Post.
[00:52:38.045 --> 00:52:44.489]  And it's worth pointing out that the Huffington Post deleted the article despite the fact the site featured articles questioning John McCain's health in 2008.
[00:52:44.869 --> 00:52:52.033]  It appears the reason why the article disappeared was the fact that Seaman didn't automatically dismiss questions surrounding Hillary's health as a conspiracy theory.
[00:52:52.154 --> 00:52:57.457]  In response to the article's deletion, the journalist described the censorship as chilling and Orwellian.
[00:52:57.677 --> 00:53:01.299]  Seaman said, quote, both of my articles have been pulled without notice of any kind.
[00:53:01.459 --> 00:53:07.083]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:53:07.123 --> 00:53:11.126]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico.
[00:53:24.255 --> 00:53:27.776]  Where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:53:27.936 --> 00:53:32.638]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:53:32.818 --> 00:53:39.541]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:53:39.621 --> 00:53:46.703]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:53:46.803 --> 00:53:48.604]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:53:48.704 --> 00:53:53.646]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:53:53.806 --> 00:53:58.170]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:01.553]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:54:01.693 --> 00:54:07.819]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:54:07.999 --> 00:54:09.660]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[00:54:31.716 --> 00:54:43.358]  The mainstream media tries to make jokes about people that talk about the death list, but then Google, Twitter, Facebook, and everyone else admits they censor links to just the carnage, the death, the murder.
[00:54:43.418 --> 00:54:49.880]  I mean, I've interviewed the CIA head contractor from MENA, Terry Reid, probably 10, 15 times.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.380]  By the way, he used to basically work at WorldNet Daily.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.801]  We need to call Joseph Farah and ask if he has Terry Reid's contact.
[00:54:55.041 --> 00:54:55.661]  It's my number for him.
[00:54:55.681 --> 00:54:56.621]  He hadn't been on in like 10 years.
[00:54:56.641 --> 00:54:58.222]  I haven't had Terry Reid on in like 10 years.
[00:54:58.482 --> 00:54:59.682]  There's a bounty out, folks.
[00:55:00.657 --> 00:55:02.901]  Whoever gets me Terry Reid's number, 500 bucks.
[00:55:03.942 --> 00:55:05.605]  He wrote Clinton, Bush, and the CIA.
[00:55:05.765 --> 00:55:07.448]  It's all completely fake.
[00:55:07.968 --> 00:55:10.572]  These people have run wars, killing millions of innocent people.
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:13.962]  And then their political enemies get killed.
[00:55:13.982 --> 00:55:17.565]  You have all these DNC staffers getting killed, shot in the back, executed.
[00:55:17.845 --> 00:55:20.187]  Lawyers that sue over Bernie Sanders get executed.
[00:55:20.727 --> 00:55:22.148]  And then, oh, look at Alex Jones.
[00:55:22.409 --> 00:55:23.910]  He's worried about Hillary killing him.
[00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:24.550]  No.
[00:55:25.211 --> 00:55:27.172]  I'm saying I'm doing this no matter what.
[00:55:27.793 --> 00:55:35.079]  And I want it to be known that if something happens to me, that the prime suspect is the criminal combines in and around the Clinton crime family.
[00:55:35.439 --> 00:55:38.702]  I'm a reporter going up against the real LaCosta Nostra.
[00:55:39.645 --> 00:55:45.149]  I'm a reporter at a news agency that this war criminal has singled out directly.
[00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:50.032]  And people she does that to end up having big problems.
[00:55:50.492 --> 00:55:53.634]  And I'm saying I'm not a loser if they come and destroy me.
[00:55:55.175 --> 00:55:59.398]  The point is just to understand that we did this for the right reason.
[00:56:00.546 --> 00:56:06.411]  And I'm shining spotlight on it so that hopefully they're not too arrogant and think they can get away with it.
[00:56:06.651 --> 00:56:10.454]  But we're entering the climate where they open when we want to censor the press and create fear.
[00:56:11.175 --> 00:56:16.539]  They might come after somebody like myself now just because I am so prominent and they're taken to the next level.
[00:56:17.259 --> 00:56:20.742]  This is a very serious criminal organization we're talking about.
[00:56:21.643 --> 00:56:27.287]  By the way, we have the clip of Herwood with the doctor with the EpiPen saying, it's alright, it's okay, everything's going to be alright.
[00:56:27.307 --> 00:56:28.809]  I'm going to play that in the next segment.
[00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:30.010]  We're good to go.
[00:56:53.404 --> 00:56:58.048]  Point is, he doesn't drink, he doesn't use drugs, he's as healthy as anybody his age that exercises.
[00:56:58.068 --> 00:56:58.748]  He's really healthy.
[00:56:59.229 --> 00:57:03.972]  They turned that into him recanting, saying Donald Trump's as healthy as anybody that's ever been president.
[00:57:04.453 --> 00:57:06.775]  Most people are pretty darn sick once they get in the presidency.
[00:57:06.935 --> 00:57:08.656]  That's why the doctor who's prestigious said that.
[00:57:08.996 --> 00:57:10.237]  Donald Trump is a horse.
[00:57:10.778 --> 00:57:17.923]  He drinks a gallon of milk a day, he eats three or four steaks a day, about ten eggs a day, big dishes of vegetables.
[00:57:19.445 --> 00:57:20.806]  Donald Trump is a throwback.
[00:57:21.849 --> 00:57:24.030]  I mean, Donald Trump's drug is food.
[00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.310]  That's it.
[00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:28.511]  And he likes women, too.
[00:57:28.891 --> 00:57:30.671]  I mean, my God, what's wrong with that?
[00:57:31.051 --> 00:57:34.712]  So he's a red-blooded American, they can't stand it, and they're saying he's mentally ill.
[00:57:35.612 --> 00:57:43.154]  But here's Trump, as we go out to break, talking about he thinks that they have her emails at the NSA.
[00:57:43.374 --> 00:57:47.995]  Well, that comes from William Benny, the former head of the NSA, here on this broadcast just a month ago.
[00:57:48.055 --> 00:57:48.355]  Here it is.
[00:57:49.745 --> 00:57:56.575]  When she deleted 33,000 emails, those emails had some really bad stuff on them.
[00:57:56.615 --> 00:58:00.761]  Because look at the ones that they found, and these are probably a lot worse.
[00:58:00.801 --> 00:58:02.223]  And then not only did they delete them,
[00:58:02.785 --> 00:58:05.546]  They used a method of deletion that you can never get them back.
[00:58:05.606 --> 00:58:07.467]  You saw that yesterday for the first time.
[00:58:07.907 --> 00:58:09.447]  So she knew what she was deleting.
[00:58:09.507 --> 00:58:10.368]  It's a criminal act.
[00:58:10.768 --> 00:58:12.528]  She knew exactly what she was deleting.
[00:58:12.668 --> 00:58:16.410]  And using that kind of extensive, you know, bleaching technique, etc.
[00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:17.770]  shows a consciousness of guilt.
[00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:19.731]  We would argue as a prosecutor.
[00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:20.131]  Yeah.
[00:58:20.311 --> 00:58:21.471]  It's very expensive.
[00:58:21.571 --> 00:58:23.652]  Probably, I don't know, foolproof.
[00:58:23.912 --> 00:58:24.332]  I don't know.
[00:58:24.752 --> 00:58:26.293]  I hear the NSA maybe has
[00:58:26.843 --> 00:58:27.643]  I have emails.
[00:58:45.092 --> 00:58:47.854]  That most people never even heard of, even the syndicated people.
[00:59:00.205 --> 00:59:09.274]  If you can't see the irony in having a gun ban enforced by men with guns, well then you fail to understand why the Second Amendment was written in the first place.
[00:59:09.314 --> 00:59:12.177]  Throughout history, only slaves are disarmed.
[00:59:12.297 --> 00:59:16.041]  A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state.
[00:59:16.181 --> 00:59:17.282]  The right of the people.
[00:59:17.302 --> 00:59:18.503]  The right of the people.
[00:59:18.583 --> 00:59:19.484]  The right of the people.
[00:59:19.584 --> 00:59:22.005]  To keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:59:22.065 --> 00:59:30.972]  For all of you actors out there who go to your red carpet events, surrounded by full battle rattle SWAT teams, while you accept your awards for your latest violent movie.
[00:59:31.312 --> 00:59:42.601]  For all you politicians who spend your 9-5 days scheming up ways to take away my Second Amendment rights, meanwhile you have first responders on site there to protect you, I say this, come and take it.
[00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:45.163]  I have a strict gun control policy.
[00:59:45.723 --> 00:59:48.324]  If there's a gun around, I want to control it.
[00:59:48.964 --> 00:59:49.644]  Clint Eastwood.
[00:59:49.864 --> 00:59:50.404]  Go ahead.
[00:59:51.445 --> 00:59:52.345]  Make my day.
[00:59:52.505 --> 00:59:57.907]  Dads demand guns because it's me that's got to get up and go check out that noise at 2 a.m.
[00:59:58.107 --> 00:59:59.347]  Infowars.com.
[01:00:02.388 --> 01:00:04.989]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:19.137 --> 01:00:20.818]  You want answers?
[01:00:21.658 --> 01:00:28.040]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:30.941 --> 01:00:34.622]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.983 --> 01:00:38.704]  Alright, finishing up with this story before we get to other news.
[01:00:39.224 --> 01:00:41.104]  So Donald Trump comes out and says, I hear that
[01:00:44.031 --> 01:00:45.811]  The NSA has Hillary Clinton's emails, yes.
[01:00:46.312 --> 01:01:03.996]  The former technical leader of the NSA, the guy that invented much of what's being used today, William Benning has been a frequent guest on the broadcast and earlier this month, we're going to play that clip in a moment, he came on and said that we have her emails, but so do foreign governments.
[01:01:05.897 --> 01:01:11.278]  She was the Secretary of State and it's in the news today, we're going to be covering this coming up,
[01:01:12.213 --> 01:01:18.002]  That she indeed was selling access to the Chinese President as Secretary of State.
[01:01:18.463 --> 01:01:20.126]  She got billions and billions of dollars.
[01:01:20.707 --> 01:01:21.728]  Talk about espionage.
[01:01:21.768 --> 01:01:22.690]  This is incredible.
[01:01:23.331 --> 01:01:25.715]  These emails should absolutely destroy her.
[01:01:26.718 --> 01:01:38.527]  But she's blackmailing the rest of the government, threatening to bring the whole thing down, and she's scared to death that DrugsReport.com and Infowars.com and a few others, like Wikileaks, are willing to cover this information.
[01:01:38.807 --> 01:01:42.630]  And now they're panicking because even the Jerusalem Post came out and said, it's damning!
[01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:47.314]  George Soros is global chaos leader and is trying to overthrow the planet.
[01:01:47.754 --> 01:01:48.895]  He is a megalomaniac.
[01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:49.576]  These are quotes!
[01:01:50.575 --> 01:01:51.196]  We have them!
[01:01:52.116 --> 01:01:54.198]  We have Soros saying, censor the internet now!
[01:01:54.598 --> 01:01:56.500]  Shut down their competition in these emails.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:02.205]  And the UN gets control October 1st, unless Congress takes action and says no.
[01:02:02.465 --> 01:02:03.546]  That's in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:02:04.006 --> 01:02:05.387]  That's how real this is.
[01:02:05.408 --> 01:02:10.071]  They've been warning about it, warning about it, trying to stop it, trying to stop it.
[01:02:10.372 --> 01:02:12.994]  They've got it all lined up now and we're here in the final phase.
[01:02:14.855 --> 01:02:17.217]  Where more happens in a year than happened in the previous ten.
[01:02:18.254 --> 01:02:20.435]  And with high technology today, that's only compounded.
[01:02:20.775 --> 01:02:22.736]  So Donald Trump is right.
[01:02:23.136 --> 01:02:26.618]  Let's play William Binney, on with us, early this month.
[01:02:29.219 --> 01:02:35.561]  It's not really that they've hacked into the server, or the DNC server, or Hillary's server.
[01:02:36.402 --> 01:02:44.325]  They've got over, in the United States, in the Fairview program, they have over 100 taps on the fiber network in the United States.
[01:02:45.296 --> 01:02:55.219]  And they're doing just like Mark Klein exposed the one facility, one of the hundred, in the San Francisco facility where they have NERIS devices taking everything off the line.
[01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:57.280]  So that's what's going on.
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:04.062]  So to explain, they put gates in front of it and then copy it and scoop it all up before it ever gets where it's going.
[01:03:04.723 --> 01:03:05.143]  That's right.
[01:03:05.203 --> 01:03:06.063]  That's exactly right.
[01:03:06.143 --> 01:03:14.186]  As it passes down the line from all the service providers or all the telephone companies, they capture that as it's passing down the fiber network.
[01:03:15.599 --> 01:03:18.301]  And the telecommunications companies are helping them do that.
[01:03:18.321 --> 01:03:21.103]  The ones that run the fibers, they allow them to come in and tap the thing.
[01:03:22.044 --> 01:03:26.206]  That's what Mark Klein exposed to the AT&T facility in San Francisco.
[01:03:26.607 --> 01:03:29.028]  But that's only one of the almost 100 that they have.
[01:03:29.849 --> 01:03:33.451]  And it captures gigabits, tens of gigabits of data.
[01:03:33.471 --> 01:03:35.713]  So, at each site.
[01:03:36.647 --> 01:03:40.348]  So that means that's how they acquire the data.
[01:03:40.728 --> 01:03:45.949]  And then they're storing it in places like the Blockdale facility that they had to build because they were collecting so much.
[01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:50.670]  And now they're building another facility on Fort D that's almost three times that size.
[01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:52.411]  It's 2.8 million square feet.
[01:03:53.311 --> 01:03:57.832]  So that's planning for the future because they're continuing to collect so much data on everybody.
[01:03:58.972 --> 01:04:01.833]  Now something else Donald Trump is right about.
[01:04:05.694 --> 01:04:06.515]  The KKK.
[01:04:06.775 --> 01:04:10.538]  Robert Byrd was a Ku Klux Klan leader.
[01:04:11.779 --> 01:04:12.840]  A senior leader.
[01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:15.762]  He is a mentor of Hillary Clinton.
[01:04:16.422 --> 01:04:22.908]  Hillary Clinton and her husband basically got elected co-governor at a time in Arkansas when the Klan still completely ran the state.
[01:04:22.928 --> 01:04:23.748]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:25.530]  There isn't a state more Klan
[01:04:27.233 --> 01:04:28.033]  Not even Alabama.
[01:04:28.753 --> 01:04:30.414]  No, no, it's Arkansas, baby.
[01:04:31.054 --> 01:04:41.257]  And let me tell you, kissing Robert Byrd, praising him, saying that he was her mentor, speaking at his funeral, Bill saying he had to join the Klan to get elected to office.
[01:04:41.437 --> 01:04:42.238]  Well, whatever.
[01:04:42.878 --> 01:04:45.539]  There isn't any connection to Donald Trump and the KKK.
[01:04:46.639 --> 01:05:09.418]  Guy from New York City, don't give me a break, who opens golf courses up to black people first, 40 years ago, when nobody wanted those elite golf courses, and hires more African Americans statistically than any of those big casino owners, and then he sits there and you call him the KKK, but now Media Matters comes out and says Trump adopts right-wing media's flawed Robert Byrd canard to distract from allegations of racism.
[01:05:11.129 --> 01:05:15.273]  The Huffington Post banned a journalist from writing about Hillary's health and even deleted his article.
[01:05:15.493 --> 01:05:20.198]  Journalist David Seaman pinned a commentary piece discussing questions surrounding Hillary's health on Sunday.
[01:05:20.338 --> 01:05:26.004]  The story even included a link to a viral InfoWars video about the subject, which has over 3.5 million views.
[01:05:26.344 --> 01:05:32.951]  And as reported by Paul Joseph Watson, the article was trending, yet the Huffington Post still deleted it within hours and even revoked Seaman's posting rights.
[01:05:33.131 --> 01:05:38.335]  The article now just contains an editor's note stating this post is no longer available on the Huffington Post.
[01:05:38.555 --> 01:05:44.979]  And it's worth pointing out that the Huffington Post deleted the article despite the fact the site featured articles questioning John McCain's health in 2008.
[01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:52.524]  It appears the reason why the article disappeared was the fact that Seaman didn't automatically dismiss questions surrounding Hillary's health as a conspiracy theory.
[01:05:52.645 --> 01:05:57.948]  In response to the article's deletion, the journalist described the censorship as chilling and Orwellian.
[01:05:58.168 --> 01:06:01.791]  Seaman said, quote, both of my articles have been pulled without notice of any kind.
[01:06:02.011 --> 01:06:03.912]  Just completely deleted from the internet.
[01:06:04.032 --> 01:06:06.053]  And both of those articles mentioned Hillary's health.
[01:06:06.293 --> 01:06:08.914]  To find out more, visit InfoWars.com.
[01:06:09.074 --> 01:06:10.335]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:06:10.975 --> 01:06:12.356]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:06:12.616 --> 01:06:13.937]  You can't survive without it.
[01:06:14.117 --> 01:06:15.037]  But where do you get it?

[01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:12.327]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:07:12.387 --> 01:07:14.288]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:07:14.428 --> 01:07:17.229]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:07:17.329 --> 01:07:23.192]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:07:23.392 --> 01:07:32.276]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.

[01:07:40.121 --> 01:07:47.827]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:49.108]  The general public doesn't.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.643]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:07:53.704 --> 01:07:57.669]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:07:57.849 --> 01:08:04.317]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:08:04.557 --> 01:08:08.642]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:08:11.065 --> 01:08:16.009]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:20.712]  Alright, well we've seen a lot of journalists.
[01:08:39.935 --> 01:08:53.300]  Like Larry King, who would actually hear both sides of an issue, or five or six different sides of it, run off of CNN, and then the ratings dropped roughly eight times what they were with him by the time Piers Morgan left.
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:54.340]  That's official.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:59.582]  From six, seven, eight million viewers, which they thought was bad, down to a half million viewers.
[01:09:00.342 --> 01:09:06.124]  And he's now on RT, and has a popular weekly magazine program seen by hundreds of millions around the world.
[01:09:06.204 --> 01:09:08.465]  It shows the decline of Western media.
[01:09:09.582 --> 01:09:17.767]  Things like RT is in more homes and seen by more people now than CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, CNBC combined.
[01:09:17.867 --> 01:09:18.248]  Look it up.
[01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:20.749]  We can make big announcements today.
[01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:23.711]  Jesse Ventura just signed with Russia Today.
[01:09:23.871 --> 01:09:28.875]  Just to illustrate what's happened to our media that isn't American media, but is globalist media.
[01:09:29.215 --> 01:09:31.637]  And he's got other big breaking news on the 8th Circuit.
[01:09:32.777 --> 01:09:34.859]  Reversing his case, refusing to hear it.
[01:09:35.677 --> 01:09:36.537]  With no comment.
[01:09:36.577 --> 01:09:43.881]  You're going to hear stuff that is unprecedented exclusively here today from Jesse Ventura, former Minnesota governor.
[01:09:43.981 --> 01:09:45.001]  And it goes further than that.
[01:09:45.101 --> 01:09:48.943]  Huffington Post bans journalists for writing about Hillary's health, deletes article.
[01:09:50.084 --> 01:09:51.625]  DC leaks website down.
[01:09:51.665 --> 01:09:57.467]  Twitter suspends account of releasing Soros docs that calls for the UN to take over the internet.
[01:09:57.727 --> 01:09:58.908]  That's the Wall Street Journal today.
[01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:00.549]  An internet giveaway to the UN.
[01:10:00.849 --> 01:10:04.331]  And George Soros saying the NGO UN will censor
[01:10:05.291 --> 01:10:09.975]  And regulate the internet to quote, favor open society supporters and not those that go along with them.
[01:10:10.375 --> 01:10:12.757]  Jesse Ventura had him come in and try to shut down his TV show.
[01:10:13.398 --> 01:10:14.599]  I've experienced it myself.
[01:10:14.999 --> 01:10:16.961]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's happening.
[01:10:17.741 --> 01:10:20.824]  And it's getting more and more and more and more naked.
[01:10:21.805 --> 01:10:24.787]  And again, you're saying, okay, Jesse Ventura's court case with Chris Kyle.
[01:10:25.848 --> 01:10:29.110]  I'm not, I'm not asking people out there to take even sides on that case.
[01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:31.693]  I've talked to people that knew Kyle, people close to Kyle.
[01:10:32.597 --> 01:10:32.837]  We're good.
[01:10:52.602 --> 01:10:59.305]  And he's going to break down today the incredible information, because he was going after the insurers, not Chris Call's wife.
[01:10:59.985 --> 01:11:04.687]  And that's why they overturned it, because they don't want the public to know that Jesse Ventura wasn't going after a widow.
[01:11:05.028 --> 01:11:06.048]  None of it was even true.
[01:11:06.928 --> 01:11:08.429]  It's incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:08.449 --> 01:11:12.131]  Spent more money than he was asking for just to prove it was a lie.
[01:11:12.651 --> 01:11:15.052]  This is the age of psyops, folks, where they'll say anything.
[01:11:15.072 --> 01:11:16.892]  They'll say, Donald Trump's in the KKK.
[01:11:17.212 --> 01:11:17.692]  None of it's true.
[01:11:17.712 --> 01:11:20.633]  They'll say, I love the KKK, but I'm famous for protesting it.
[01:11:21.053 --> 01:11:25.894]  This is a time when they'll assassinate your character, and we all have to stand together, or we're going to hang separate.
[01:11:27.034 --> 01:11:28.014]  He's the expert on it.
[01:11:28.054 --> 01:11:30.335]  He's now able to tell you everything.
[01:11:30.355 --> 01:11:31.495]  I talked to him last week.
[01:11:31.575 --> 01:11:33.015]  It was unbelievable.
[01:11:33.075 --> 01:11:34.556]  This affects jurisprudence.
[01:11:34.596 --> 01:11:36.316]  It affects all of us getting a fair trial.
[01:11:36.776 --> 01:11:41.537]  It affects the 50-something megacorporations that signed on and counter-sued Ventura.
[01:11:42.841 --> 01:11:46.168]  From News Corp to Time Warner to the New York Times.
[01:11:46.829 --> 01:11:51.778]  Because they want to have a precedent set to be able to lie and have enrichment from it.
[01:11:54.005 --> 01:11:58.190]  So all you can get is a couple hundred thousand dollars when they make 50 million off lying about you and destroy you.
[01:11:58.650 --> 01:12:02.074]  Well Jesse Ventura isn't destroyed, but he's fighting for his good name.
[01:12:02.455 --> 01:12:04.157]  And he's a friend of mine, that's why we got him here today.
[01:12:04.777 --> 01:12:06.159]  Governor, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:12:06.179 --> 01:12:07.020]  You've got the floor.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.703]  I've never heard you so focused and quietly angry.
[01:12:10.003 --> 01:12:13.708]  Launch into what you told me last week when you said you wanted to give us the exclusive.
[01:12:14.238 --> 01:12:16.942]  Well, Alex, you're hitting the nail on the head.
[01:12:17.382 --> 01:12:28.757]  My case got so big, I'll run down a quick list of all the media people that entered it, and as you said, they wanted the unjust enrichment overturned, which
[01:12:29.298 --> 01:12:43.804]  The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals accommodated them, even though they argued a different theory in front of the 8th Circuit than what was argued in the actual trial, which is illegal.
[01:12:44.024 --> 01:12:48.466]  Well, not illegal, but they're not supposed to be allowed to do that, and amazingly,
[01:12:49.046 --> 01:13:03.471]  Three days after they ruled my way against me and allowed this theory to come in after the trial, there was another case where they tried to bring in the 11th Amendment after the trial and they denied it.
[01:13:04.366 --> 01:13:08.531]  So they go whichever way is politically they want to do it.
[01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:11.474]  They're not going by the rules, they're not going by the law.
[01:13:11.994 --> 01:13:21.665]  Now, some of the media that entered this case, A&E Television Networks, the Association of American Publishers, the Authors Guild, BuzzFeed Inc.,
[01:13:22.425 --> 01:13:35.708]  Uh, Cox Media Group, Scripps Company, Forbes Media, Gannett Company, Gawker, Hatchet, the list goes down the line of all, and these are names you may not be used to because they're corporate names.
[01:13:36.248 --> 01:13:39.209]  These are the corporations that run all the media.
[01:13:39.829 --> 01:13:44.330]  Uh, the National Association of Broadcasters, National Press Photographers,
[01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:59.674]  New York Media, New York Times Company, Penguin Random House, Time Incorporated, Tribune Publishing, the list goes on and on and the reason they wanted this overturned is precisely what you said, Alex.
[01:14:00.254 --> 01:14:02.795]  So that they can go out and defame people.
[01:14:03.135 --> 01:14:05.436]  They don't have to do any background checking.
[01:14:05.456 --> 01:14:07.557]  They don't have to even know if it's true or not.
[01:14:07.917 --> 01:14:09.918]  They can defame you to make money.
[01:14:09.938 --> 01:14:16.260]  And then when they're done making the money, you, the defamed person, can't get any of that money from them.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.641]  And the court stood up and said that that's fine.
[01:14:19.261 --> 01:14:19.461]  Now...
[01:14:20.302 --> 01:14:21.944]  That isn't even the biggest one.
[01:14:22.404 --> 01:14:30.433]  The biggest thing they did was they turned the case over and ordered a new trial based upon that the truth came out.
[01:14:31.294 --> 01:14:32.695]  And let me explain.
[01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:38.862]  During the trial, Taya Kyle got on the stand and did what's called poor-mouthing.
[01:14:39.466 --> 01:14:47.834]  She's told the jury that this trial was running her out of money, that it was a huge financial burden on her and her children, which was not true.
[01:14:48.314 --> 01:14:48.955]  We knew it.
[01:14:49.275 --> 01:14:49.876]  They knew it.
[01:14:49.976 --> 01:14:50.536]  She knew it.
[01:14:50.556 --> 01:14:51.497]  Give folks the numbers.
[01:14:51.537 --> 01:14:52.398]  Give folks the numbers.
[01:14:52.879 --> 01:14:56.622]  Well, insurance was paying for it all on their side.
[01:14:57.082 --> 01:15:03.829]  On my side, I've forked out almost just a little over a million dollars now to defend myself.
[01:15:04.489 --> 01:15:06.390]  Their side paid by insurance.
[01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:15.672]  Now, what happened was the judge still wouldn't allow us to tell the jury the truth that insurance was paying for it until late in the trial.
[01:15:16.332 --> 01:15:30.315]  Late in the trial, they brought in two witnesses from HarperCollins, the book company, who were downplaying my importance on purpose because they knew they were going to lose and they wanted to lower the award and make it as low as possible.
[01:15:31.155 --> 01:15:37.800]  Well, at that point, Federal Judge Kyle, who presided over the case, ruled that was too much.
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:41.202]  It was a conflict of interest, these book company people coming in.
[01:15:41.723 --> 01:15:45.425]  So he allowed the insurance to come into the trial limited.
[01:15:46.006 --> 01:15:47.166]  Now, here's what it was.
[01:15:47.267 --> 01:15:58.875]  It was four questions of these HarperCollins two people out of an 11-day trial, and it was a half a page of a 20-page final lawyer summary.
[01:15:59.495 --> 01:16:04.897]  Now, the rules, it was never objected to by the other side when it was allowed in.
[01:16:05.457 --> 01:16:20.681]  The rules state clearly, even from the Supreme Court, that if during final arguments it must be objected to in front of the jury, to give the presiding judge an opportunity to rule in front of the jury.
[01:16:20.721 --> 01:16:21.202]  And they didn't?
[01:16:21.782 --> 01:16:22.362]  They did not.
[01:16:22.442 --> 01:16:28.784]  And let's be clear, you've got one of the top lawyers in the country, you've won other suits, other people have failed.
[01:16:30.729 --> 01:16:34.432]  No, I'm saying this is cut and dry and even I know that from law.
[01:16:34.752 --> 01:16:36.553]  It's cut and dry.
[01:16:37.014 --> 01:16:39.775]  So at 1158, they dismissed the jury.
[01:16:40.216 --> 01:16:46.420]  At 1202, they objected to the insurance being brought into the trial.
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:50.403]  The judge overruled them immediately and it was over.
[01:16:51.135 --> 01:17:01.444]  Well, these two judges, Shepard and Riley, took it upon themselves that they felt it should have been objected to, so they did it after on their own.
[01:17:01.464 --> 01:17:02.885]  But that would deceive the jury.
[01:17:02.965 --> 01:17:05.728]  I mean, let's talk about the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been made.
[01:17:06.228 --> 01:17:09.111]  Last time I heard, she's ranked in 40-something million, but I want to be clear.
[01:17:11.058 --> 01:17:19.345]  I want to separate even Chris Kyle out of this because I know people that actually served with him as SEALs but also Army that was involved and they believe there was a setup.
[01:17:19.426 --> 01:17:26.432]  He was executed up by Dallas and a cover-up and that psy-op somehow was inserted into the book that he was somehow instructed.
[01:17:26.532 --> 01:17:30.556]  SEALs are never involved as you know, formerly one, in propaganda.
[01:17:30.576 --> 01:17:32.097]  The Army says they'll never be involved.
[01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:34.779]  This was unprecedented that this happened.
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.381]  And something's going on here.
[01:17:37.441 --> 01:17:44.245]  There's a cover-up going on, and at very high levels, they don't want you to be able to prove that that wasn't true.
[01:17:44.265 --> 01:17:45.866]  But you've done that to a jury.
[01:17:46.226 --> 01:17:49.107]  And I just want to point out, I like Daily Caller, but I'm going to correct them.
[01:17:49.428 --> 01:17:50.308]  They have a new article out.
[01:17:50.348 --> 01:17:54.791]  Jesse Ventura wants the Supreme Court to make Chris Kyle's widow pay him millions.
[01:17:55.451 --> 01:18:00.013]  Anybody that studied the case knows the lie is that Jesse Ventura is beating up a widow.
[01:18:00.494 --> 01:18:03.515]  Jesse Ventura said, you know, take that back.
[01:18:04.936 --> 01:18:06.837]  And then I'm not going to shoot you.
[01:18:06.877 --> 01:18:10.720]  Well, he got killed before he could take it back, basically, and I guess he wouldn't take it back before that.
[01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:11.861]  That is not true.
[01:18:11.921 --> 01:18:13.542]  Let's be truthful here, Alex.
[01:18:13.562 --> 01:18:14.142]  You can hear the end.
[01:18:14.162 --> 01:18:14.883]  I said he got killed.
[01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:18.585]  I guess he did take it back, or didn't he?
[01:18:19.205 --> 01:18:24.609]  I left for Mexico and I drive there and I live off the grid, so I had no way to respond.
[01:18:25.169 --> 01:18:29.192]  This story broke in January, two weeks after I got down to Mexico.
[01:18:29.212 --> 01:18:32.435]  I was unable to come back because I drive, I don't fly.
[01:18:32.455 --> 01:18:35.417]  And so we brought lawsuit immediately.
[01:18:35.537 --> 01:18:40.141]  In June, Chris Kyle kept saying we could work it out if we met.
[01:18:40.902 --> 01:18:43.483]  In June, we had our first settlement conference.
[01:18:43.583 --> 01:18:44.764]  June of 2012.
[01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:47.685]  I met face-to-face with Chris Kyle.
[01:18:48.045 --> 01:18:49.306]  I looked him right in the eye.
[01:18:49.346 --> 01:18:52.848]  I said, how can you do this when you know it didn't happen?
[01:18:53.328 --> 01:19:00.811]  I said, if you will go out today and admit it was fabricated, I will forgive you and we will both go about our business.
[01:19:01.192 --> 01:19:04.493]  Chris Kyle did not have the courage to tell the truth.
[01:19:06.494 --> 01:19:07.094]  Clear here.
[01:19:07.114 --> 01:19:09.675]  Obviously, I'm the guy that called and told you you got the word from me.
[01:19:09.955 --> 01:19:10.595]  I know the story.
[01:19:10.635 --> 01:19:11.295]  You are correct.
[01:19:11.715 --> 01:19:15.816]  What I was saying is, and I didn't get to finish it, so what I did say was incorrect because I didn't finish it.
[01:19:15.856 --> 01:19:21.958]  I'm saying he didn't ever get a chance by the end to basically go back on what he said.
[01:19:21.978 --> 01:19:23.618]  He wasn't of anyway.
[01:19:24.079 --> 01:19:25.239]  I think he was getting ready to.
[01:19:25.259 --> 01:19:27.199]  He wasn't going to at all.
[01:19:27.219 --> 01:19:27.620]  It's a sea story.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.240]  It's a common thing in the Navy.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.660]  It's called a C-Story.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:36.521]  You lie to your buddies and you tell them a big story and your buddies all believe it.
[01:19:37.102 --> 01:19:39.282]  And then the lie becomes the truth.
[01:19:39.702 --> 01:19:41.103]  And that's exactly what Chris Kyle did.
[01:19:41.123 --> 01:19:41.363]  Sure.
[01:19:41.383 --> 01:19:46.024]  Well he did die very suspiciously and I'm just trying to depoliticize it because they try to do it.
[01:19:46.064 --> 01:19:47.224]  You never went after his widow.
[01:19:47.504 --> 01:19:48.484]  She never lost money.
[01:19:48.704 --> 01:19:50.265]  She makes tens of millions of dollars.
[01:19:50.545 --> 01:19:51.785]  You were just getting her name back.
[01:19:52.446 --> 01:19:57.452]  Yes, and Taya Kyle or the children haven't lost a penny.
[01:19:57.472 --> 01:20:00.054]  An insurance company paid for it all.
[01:20:00.315 --> 01:20:03.318]  But the other side wanted to make me look bad.
[01:20:03.758 --> 01:20:09.885]  So they perpetrated this myth that I was going after the widow and the children.
[01:20:10.386 --> 01:20:13.249]  And that's what they've tried to do through this whole thing.
[01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:15.510]  Well, I mean look, look, look... I understand.
[01:20:40.459 --> 01:20:43.399]  Which shows more and more government and the courts are doing whatever they want.
[01:20:43.419 --> 01:20:43.859]  It's lawless.
[01:20:43.919 --> 01:20:44.639]  I totally agree.
[01:20:44.939 --> 01:20:56.981]  The fact that she can come in and say Jesse Ventura is trying to make me poor and you can't point out and impeach that that is incorrect and that she's making tens of millions and that it's her insurance company that's just gonna have to give you a few million.
[01:20:57.682 --> 01:21:05.383]  That is wild that they're saying that can't be given to the jury even though they're the ones that didn't object.
[01:21:06.244 --> 01:21:06.905]  Exactly.
[01:21:07.225 --> 01:21:08.646]  And that's what went down here.
[01:21:08.706 --> 01:21:19.414]  You had two activist judges, Riley and Shepard, it was a two-to-one, who both allowed this to happen even though they violated their own rules.
[01:21:19.494 --> 01:21:20.475]  Why do you think they did this?
[01:21:20.515 --> 01:21:21.676]  Why do you think they went so far?
[01:21:22.403 --> 01:21:24.604]  Well, they don't like me, obviously.
[01:21:24.624 --> 01:21:28.406]  And let me add this.
[01:21:28.466 --> 01:21:32.748]  These are not only dishonest judges because they're not even following their own rule.
[01:21:33.148 --> 01:21:34.809]  And let me put this into context.
[01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:36.110]  It's like golf.
[01:21:36.650 --> 01:21:37.871]  You go out and play golf.
[01:21:37.931 --> 01:21:39.311]  It's a game of honesty.
[01:21:39.772 --> 01:21:41.933]  Not everybody can watch you every minute.
[01:21:41.973 --> 01:21:44.594]  You're dependent upon being honest to the rules.
[01:21:45.114 --> 01:21:47.495]  If you don't, you're a dishonest golfer.
[01:21:47.956 --> 01:21:49.356]  Same thing for these judges.
[01:21:49.436 --> 01:21:50.297]  They have rules.
[01:21:51.278 --> 01:21:53.519]  Speaking of judges, are you saying they're Judge Schmales?
[01:21:53.579 --> 01:21:54.540]  These guys are Judge Schmales.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:55.860]  They're worse.
[01:21:56.461 --> 01:21:58.382]  Because they cause way more damage.
[01:21:58.442 --> 01:22:00.242]  They don't follow their own rules.
[01:22:00.323 --> 01:22:01.703]  That makes them dishonest.
[01:22:02.043 --> 01:22:02.964]  And let me add this.
[01:22:03.804 --> 01:22:07.386]  They wrote a 29-page summary of this case.
[01:22:08.186 --> 01:22:14.169]  Never once during those 29 pages did they give me my title as governor.
[01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:17.351]  I was referred to completely as Ventura.
[01:22:18.095 --> 01:22:19.596]  Now, an example.
[01:22:19.976 --> 01:22:22.457]  I flew over to Moscow last December.
[01:22:22.777 --> 01:22:25.078]  I met President Vladimir Putin.
[01:22:25.658 --> 01:22:26.999]  He called me governor.
[01:22:27.019 --> 01:22:35.243]  So the head of Russia gives me more respect than two federal judges on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals?
[01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:39.045]  Well, you always say governor in somebody's title after they've been governor.
[01:22:39.425 --> 01:22:42.106]  You always say governor, especially in written documents, when someone's been a governor.
[01:22:43.413 --> 01:22:43.853]  They didn't.
[01:22:44.334 --> 01:22:49.197]  There isn't one reference to me as governor in the entire 29 pages they wrote.
[01:22:49.317 --> 01:22:54.220]  Look, the big corporations that donate money want to set the precedent of being able to lie about whoever they want.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:58.202]  I mean, they go on MSNBC and say, quote, I am deeply racist.
[01:22:58.622 --> 01:23:00.143]  Alex Jones hates black people.
[01:23:01.004 --> 01:23:02.865]  Alex Jones wants to hurt Hillary Clinton.
[01:23:03.285 --> 01:23:04.005]  All this bull.
[01:23:04.046 --> 01:23:06.307]  They just, more and more, the lies are just crazy.
[01:23:07.219 --> 01:23:11.401]  Well, and they can get away with it because, Alex, the judges back them up.
[01:23:11.461 --> 01:23:17.064]  The judges allow... With this ruling in my case, you got nothing to get them on.
[01:23:17.304 --> 01:23:27.529]  The media will be able to lie about anybody, and you will not be able to get any unjust enrichment thanks to these two judges who took it upon themselves.
[01:23:28.309 --> 01:23:33.774]  And to overrule a jury, now how disrespectful is that of the jury of Minnesota?
[01:23:34.215 --> 01:23:45.926]  Who hurt, now and think of this, for all you naysayers out there who think that I'm wrong, how much evidence must there have been for a jury to overrule the war veteran?
[01:23:47.287 --> 01:23:47.727]  Absolutely.
[01:23:47.868 --> 01:23:49.048]  Well I've seen the evidence.
[01:23:49.068 --> 01:23:49.929]  I've seen the evidence.
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:15.711]  You have two judges here that never sat in for one second of the trial and basically told the jury they were wrong.
[01:24:15.812 --> 01:24:17.174]  Well, Governor, let's go further here.
[01:24:17.795 --> 01:24:19.036]  Let's just go back to the case.
[01:24:19.317 --> 01:24:23.503]  You are somebody I've flown around the country with, you know, taping the TV shows, shooting them.
[01:24:24.224 --> 01:24:46.236]  And I've seen you, the only time you get emotional is when you see troops getting on planes and you talk to them and say, you know, be safe, you know, these wars and things are, you know, based on lies and you go to commencements, you go to memorials, you speak at them, you were there to be part of the commencement and you're going to stand there in the most popular Navy SEAL bar and say, I'm glad Navy SEALs are getting killed.
[01:24:46.637 --> 01:24:48.378]  Clearly that's designed to defame you.
[01:24:48.998 --> 01:24:50.439]  It's bigger than saying he beat you up.
[01:24:50.999 --> 01:25:06.665]  And so, what I'm saying is, talking to the family of Pat Tillman, talking and warning, you know, Private Lynch, who then went, obviously, public and said, it's all fake, that when you're involved in propaganda, at that level, and when you start to go south, they tend to get rid of you.
[01:25:06.765 --> 01:25:10.126]  Or, if you're about to speak out, look at Pat Tillman, who they executed.
[01:25:10.146 --> 01:25:13.367]  I mean, even the Army coroner, who was a colonel, said he was executed.
[01:25:13.387 --> 01:25:14.227]  He was assassinated.
[01:25:14.487 --> 01:25:15.108]  He was murdered.
[01:25:16.508 --> 01:25:17.248]  That's what happened.
[01:25:17.288 --> 01:25:24.370]  And so I'm simply saying there's a way to basically go around their propaganda that you're suing his wife, which you're not.
[01:25:25.051 --> 01:25:34.053]  You're suing the people that put this whole lie out to get the insurance and to have the jury come out and say, yes, you prove your case, which you did.
[01:25:34.553 --> 01:25:35.774]  I'm saying if you
[01:25:36.454 --> 01:25:41.057]  Give us your view on political assassinations and how mysterious this is that he died.
[01:25:41.378 --> 01:25:45.140]  It kind of just goes around the whole propaganda nest they've set up.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.181]  I mean, let me put it to you this way, Governor.
[01:25:46.501 --> 01:25:48.082]  What do you think really happened here?
[01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:50.804]  I mean, this is pretty suspicious what happened to Chris Kyle.
[01:25:51.525 --> 01:25:54.927]  Well, it's suspicious in the fact all of it is.
[01:25:55.007 --> 01:25:59.711]  You know, I tried to stay away from his tragic death, but
[01:26:00.442 --> 01:26:08.188]  I, for one, am trying to figure out, okay, Kyle and his friend are with this Marine who's suffering from post-traumatic stress.
[01:26:09.068 --> 01:26:15.213]  First of all, how is Chris Kyle or his friend at all trained to deal with post-traumatic stress?
[01:26:15.313 --> 01:26:15.793]  They're not.
[01:26:16.694 --> 01:26:20.436]  So why is it their obligation to do what they allegedly were doing?
[01:26:20.897 --> 01:26:22.638]  Second of all, common sense?
[01:26:23.619 --> 01:26:35.405]  Someone suffering from post-traumatic stress, I would look at that and go, the last thing I would do is put a loaded weapon in his hands, and that's what they did out at this firing range apparently.
[01:26:35.925 --> 01:26:50.533]  I don't want to comment on the death because I wasn't there, I don't know what happened, but all I know is this marine with heavy post-traumatic stress got a loaded weapon put in his hand and subsequently killed two people.
[01:26:51.193 --> 01:26:52.494]  And I'm trying to figure out
[01:26:53.506 --> 01:26:58.049]  Where Kyle and his friend got the medical expertise to be treating.
[01:26:58.409 --> 01:27:01.171]  Let me tell you what I've been told is what they said they were doing.
[01:27:01.351 --> 01:27:02.152]  Well, I'm here in Texas.
[01:27:02.172 --> 01:27:03.393]  So let me just tell you what I've been told.
[01:27:03.473 --> 01:27:06.915]  People that are on record friends with Kyle, none of them buy it.
[01:27:07.535 --> 01:27:09.076]  They say that's not really what happened.
[01:27:09.476 --> 01:27:11.458]  And so you've got this book, Nothing Against Clint Eastwood.
[01:27:11.498 --> 01:27:11.878]  I love him.
[01:27:12.098 --> 01:27:16.101]  It's going to be this big $500 million movie and all the rest of it.
[01:27:16.761 --> 01:27:25.125]  And I'm telling you, there are people upstairs that didn't want that narrative getting disrupted, and Chris Kyle magically then disappears.
[01:27:25.425 --> 01:27:26.526]  And take the Boston bombing.
[01:27:26.626 --> 01:27:28.566]  I'm not saying Kraft International was involved.
[01:27:28.927 --> 01:27:30.167]  We know there were drills that day.
[01:27:30.207 --> 01:27:37.170]  We know there were guys wearing the Kraft uniform with the Punisher hats that were there with black backpacks, probably part of the same drill.
[01:27:37.491 --> 01:27:39.972]  I'm telling you, Kyle was involved in some really heavy stuff.
[01:27:41.372 --> 01:27:44.474]  And the people I know that know him say that they don't buy the official story, Jesse.
[01:27:45.154 --> 01:27:51.799]  Well, that I'm not going to get into because I don't know that much about it, nor do I even want to particularly.
[01:27:51.819 --> 01:27:52.340]  Sure, I understand.
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:28:01.447]  I have to deal with my end of it, and my end of it is that Kyle was killed, and that's standard procedure then.
[01:28:01.487 --> 01:28:04.509]  My lawsuit was against him because he defamed me.
[01:28:04.989 --> 01:28:08.372]  When he dies, it automatically switches to his estate.
[01:28:09.605 --> 01:28:13.687]  And the estate is covered by insurance and anybody that writes a book.
[01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:15.308]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:28:15.768 --> 01:28:18.869]  I've written seven or eight New York Times... You gotta pay insurance money.
[01:28:19.169 --> 01:28:20.070]  You gotta pay for the insurance.
[01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:22.491]  Everyone that writes a book is covered by insurance.
[01:28:22.531 --> 01:28:25.973]  Your book publisher has insurance against defamation.
[01:28:26.213 --> 01:28:26.473]  It's O&E.
[01:28:29.216 --> 01:28:34.141]  I mean, it is part of a book deal that part of the money you don't get is what goes to the insurance.
[01:28:52.048 --> 01:28:53.731]  I'm no lawyer, but I've studied the law.
[01:28:53.951 --> 01:28:56.735]  They're not going to be able to keep this out next time either.
[01:28:56.775 --> 01:29:01.963]  There's an absolute right if she gets up there and says that you're taking all her money and taking her kids' money.
[01:29:01.983 --> 01:29:03.806]  You're going to be able to point out it's insurance again.
[01:29:03.826 --> 01:29:04.567]  That's just not true.
[01:29:04.587 --> 01:29:07.772]  No, we can't because they'll overturn it again.
[01:29:08.553 --> 01:29:15.517]  I don't see how you're allowed to tell a jury that the money's coming from you and tell the press that, and you can't point out there's insurance for News Corp.
[01:29:15.777 --> 01:29:24.502]  I can tell you why, because the insurance lobby has lobbied the politicians with dirty bribe money, and they've gotten the judicial department.
[01:29:24.922 --> 01:29:34.527]  The belief is that if a jury knows insurance is paying for it, insurance companies have screwed everybody over, so they're going to stick it to the insurance company.
[01:29:35.109 --> 01:29:43.096]  But the reality is, the insurance company pays off the politicians who appoint the judges, and then that's why it's not allowed.
[01:29:43.437 --> 01:29:45.078]  The truth is not allowed in the courtroom.
[01:29:45.178 --> 01:29:47.961]  And by the way, you were basically... Alex, I'll give you another example.
[01:29:47.981 --> 01:29:48.762]  Gotta go to break, sir.
[01:29:48.782 --> 01:29:49.402]  Stay right there.
[01:29:49.422 --> 01:29:50.163]  Stay right there.
[01:29:50.443 --> 01:29:51.945]  A former talk show host, he knows about those.
[01:29:52.225 --> 01:29:53.566]  Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[01:29:53.906 --> 01:29:55.067]  This case is big, folks.
[01:29:55.087 --> 01:29:56.048]  It goes into a lot of areas.
[01:29:56.068 --> 01:29:56.469]  Stay with us.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:02.763]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.704 --> 01:30:12.212]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:12.813 --> 01:30:16.477]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[01:30:16.517 --> 01:30:17.117]  Americanism, not globalism!
[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:21.662]  Americanism, not globalism!
[01:30:25.163 --> 01:30:29.204]  The era of economic surrender will finally be over.
[01:30:29.524 --> 01:30:35.606]  We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.
[01:30:35.986 --> 01:30:43.488]  They have gotten the political establishment and the media establishment to become pure, wanton henchmen of totalitarianism.
[01:30:43.848 --> 01:30:52.251]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.
[01:30:52.691 --> 01:30:55.232]  I think what the Chinese have done is really smart.
[01:30:55.753 --> 01:31:06.658]  The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit.
[01:31:06.918 --> 01:31:12.581]  It's all training us to accept less, lowering expectations, a post-industrial world, a new dark age.
[01:31:12.721 --> 01:31:16.583]  That's what the UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 calls for.
[01:31:16.783 --> 01:31:20.225]  When we abandon the policy of America first,
[01:31:21.025 --> 01:31:25.047]  We started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.
[01:31:25.447 --> 01:31:29.549]  Not a world, Winston, that gets more beautiful and more technological and stronger.
[01:31:29.829 --> 01:31:32.610]  A world that gets uglier and stupider and more stunted.
[01:31:32.850 --> 01:31:39.453]  The government should allow Hillary Clinton to become President of the United States.
[01:31:39.973 --> 01:31:41.693]  I voted for Hillary Clinton.
[01:31:41.994 --> 01:31:43.074]  Well, I voted for Hillary.
[01:31:43.294 --> 01:31:45.255]  I guess I have to since I'm working for her as well.
[01:31:45.635 --> 01:31:47.557]  You want an image of the future, Winston?
[01:31:47.757 --> 01:31:49.919]  It's a boot stomping on a human face forever!
[01:31:50.059 --> 01:31:56.466]  Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.
[01:31:56.646 --> 01:32:01.130]  Women are treated discriminated against in all these countries she took money against.
[01:32:01.451 --> 01:32:04.954]  Gays and lesbians are either executed or punished severely.
[01:32:05.014 --> 01:32:05.915]  They're mistreated.
[01:32:06.555 --> 01:32:07.877]  She claims to be their champion.
[01:32:08.317 --> 01:32:16.923]  Don't look at me, Winston, and see the black circles around my eyes, and see how ugly and weak I am, expressing myself and dying, and I torture people 18 hours a day, and I have a horrible life!
[01:32:17.143 --> 01:32:21.466]  That's the beauty of the satanic evil of the priest of power ripping apart humanity!
[01:32:21.606 --> 01:32:22.767]  We're here to hurt humans!
[01:32:22.887 --> 01:32:24.328]  We're here to suck your guts out!
[01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:42.231]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[01:32:42.471 --> 01:32:44.191]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:44.251 --> 01:32:46.972]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:32:47.192 --> 01:32:47.993]  Alex Jones.
[01:32:48.093 --> 01:32:50.834]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:32:50.894 --> 01:32:54.115]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:32:54.135 --> 01:32:55.455]  Deeply I think racist.
[01:32:55.555 --> 01:32:57.396]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[01:32:57.516 --> 01:32:59.316]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[01:32:59.336 --> 01:33:03.418]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:33:03.438 --> 01:33:04.598]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:04.658 --> 01:33:09.560]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:33:16.186 --> 01:33:17.467]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:17.807 --> 01:33:24.132]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:27.234 --> 01:33:31.318]  Governor Ventura during the break was pointing out that the court's supposed to be a place where the truth comes in.
[01:33:31.918 --> 01:33:34.080]  He was saying in more and more cases it's a place for lies.
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:35.641]  But his judge was good.
[01:33:36.321 --> 01:33:38.303]  His jury saw the facts.
[01:33:40.445 --> 01:33:42.266]  And it didn't matter.
[01:33:43.187 --> 01:33:45.649]  Because now the 8th Circuit just said without comment, no.
[01:33:47.662 --> 01:33:52.745]  So now Governor Ventura is going to have a whole other trial after spending over a million dollars of his own money.
[01:33:53.206 --> 01:33:55.307]  And you look at the amount he was asking for, it wasn't even that much.
[01:33:55.327 --> 01:33:59.490]  He's basically spent what he's trying to get just to get a ruling to say that's not true.
[01:34:00.330 --> 01:34:03.012]  And see if they can do it to him, they can do it to anybody.
[01:34:04.513 --> 01:34:09.556]  I think that's why Trump is right when he says that the libel and slander laws are not strong enough in this country.
[01:34:11.017 --> 01:34:14.400]  I only attack big establishment people that I can really defend.
[01:34:15.367 --> 01:34:17.109]  George Soros is trying to overthrow this country.
[01:34:17.889 --> 01:34:19.911]  We've got his emails that prove it.
[01:34:19.951 --> 01:34:26.056]  I don't just, you know, sit there and just randomly say, I beat up Jesse Ventura and he said he's glad the Navy SEALs are dying.
[01:34:26.097 --> 01:34:27.778]  I mean, you know, I'm a big man.
[01:34:27.798 --> 01:34:29.600]  Well, then I'm going to have to face that in court.
[01:34:30.721 --> 01:34:33.123]  And again, I don't want to sit here and even choose sides in all this.
[01:34:33.243 --> 01:34:34.244]  It's a tragedy.
[01:34:35.725 --> 01:34:37.927]  He won in court and now look what's happened.
[01:34:38.948 --> 01:34:41.210]  Again, don't let them trick you into making this about a widow.
[01:34:42.128 --> 01:34:44.150]  We're going to go back to Governor Ventura here in just a minute.
[01:34:44.370 --> 01:34:46.111]  That's the big secret they don't want out.
[01:34:47.252 --> 01:34:49.915]  Is that it was insurance, News Corp, Fox.
[01:34:50.875 --> 01:34:52.397]  Billions and billions and billions a year.
[01:34:52.757 --> 01:34:54.739]  News Corp is 30, 40, 50 billion a year.
[01:34:55.379 --> 01:34:56.380]  It's not just Fox News.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.102]  They put this book out.
[01:34:58.662 --> 01:34:59.323]  They promoted it.
[01:34:59.363 --> 01:35:00.524]  They didn't tell their viewers that.
[01:35:01.676 --> 01:35:06.320]  I can just hear the folks involved saying, why don't you add this in there?
[01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:09.863]  Because they were involved in dirty tricks against Ventura then because they've been scared of him.
[01:35:09.883 --> 01:35:11.844]  So we're going to be breaking all that down coming up.
[01:35:12.865 --> 01:35:15.127]  We have a really, really big special running right now.
[01:35:15.367 --> 01:35:18.110]  It's 20% off on the Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink.
[01:35:19.375 --> 01:35:20.415]  It is concentrated.
[01:35:21.055 --> 01:35:22.296]  It's great for your family.
[01:35:22.336 --> 01:35:23.276]  It's great for your children.
[01:35:23.296 --> 01:35:28.478]  It has massive absorbability of the organic vitamins and minerals and trace elements and amino acids.
[01:35:28.998 --> 01:35:36.880]  This is light years better than the pill form of even somewhat bioavailable organic multivitamins.
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:42.241]  The way to drink it is obviously as a fruit punch, and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[01:35:42.281 --> 01:35:47.643]  And look at this, you know, I drink this every day at home, but I tend to forget to do it
[01:35:48.562 --> 01:35:49.123]  At work.
[01:35:50.384 --> 01:35:54.387]  But then I thought, why not just get a picture of this, the crew loves it anyways, and have some on air.
[01:35:54.868 --> 01:36:01.474]  And the great part about it is, it's healthy, it's natural, it's of the highest quality, it's affordable, and it funds this broadcast.

[01:36:20.545 --> 01:36:30.089]  Purely organic, very strong, from the mustard seed, used throughout your body in electrochemical activity, inside the cells, inside the neurons.
[01:36:30.609 --> 01:36:39.633]  You can go read about it on the site, you can go look at studies for yourself about selenium, and it's just as important as vitamin C or true nation iodine like X2.
[01:36:39.693 --> 01:36:41.454]  It goes together with those.
[01:36:42.486 --> 01:36:47.467]  That's InfoWarsLive.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:48.648 --> 01:37:00.351]  And finally, since Hillary Clinton came out last week and said I have this dark, evil heart and I'm a horrible person because I say 9-11 was an inside job and Oklahoma City was an inside job and they misrepresent what I say about Sandy Hook.
[01:37:00.771 --> 01:37:03.912]  Other people are sure it's all actors or mad at me that I'm not saying they're all actors.
[01:37:04.372 --> 01:37:07.193]  I'm saying Anderson Cooper's on a blue screen up there.
[01:37:07.293 --> 01:37:08.854]  It's the adults are acting like actors.
[01:37:09.594 --> 01:37:12.875]  Bloomberg sent an email out the day before saying, get ready, something big is about to happen.
[01:37:13.075 --> 01:37:14.096]  Get ready to go after the guns.
[01:37:14.756 --> 01:37:16.017]  To his little anti-gun group.
[01:37:16.357 --> 01:37:17.517]  It's a big anti-gun group.
[01:37:17.717 --> 01:37:19.198]  And so she misrepresents.
[01:37:19.738 --> 01:37:22.059]  So we're having Operation Dark Heart special.
[01:37:22.279 --> 01:37:24.220]  Hillary for Prison shirts at cost $9.95.
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:26.461]  That includes shipping.
[01:37:27.301 --> 01:37:29.502]  Infowarsstore.com is the big umbrella site.
[01:37:29.982 --> 01:37:33.723]  Infowarsstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:37:33.763 --> 01:37:37.445]  It's sending a huge message out there across the world.
[01:37:39.036 --> 01:37:41.377]  Hillary Clinton, all her wars, all her warmongering.
[01:37:41.397 --> 01:37:43.579]  You know, people can say, well, I don't like Trump or Hillary.
[01:37:43.939 --> 01:37:49.722]  Trump didn't launch all the different wars, all the different bombings, Libya, Syria.
[01:37:49.942 --> 01:37:52.523]  Hillary bragged, she came, she saw, Gaddafi died.
[01:37:52.824 --> 01:37:54.424]  Hillary is clearly far worse.
[01:37:54.464 --> 01:38:00.508]  And I know, Governor Ventura, I want to go to you on this just briefly in the back of the court case, which affects us all.
[01:38:02.168 --> 01:38:11.178]  I know you're always a third party guy and I've supported third parties because usually we have a McCain and Obama or we have a George Bush and somebody else who's just as bad.
[01:38:11.778 --> 01:38:22.530]  But I gotta tell you, clearly with these emails, clearly with Hillary and all these wars, clearly with her whole history and how long she's been in and vacationing with the Bushes and all of it, your knowledge of that is lengthy.
[01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:23.971]  You've written big books on these families.
[01:38:25.412 --> 01:38:29.156]  I would just really love to see you come out and support Donald Trump.
[01:38:29.176 --> 01:38:31.618]  I know you've played golf with him and known him for decades.
[01:38:31.658 --> 01:38:32.779]  I guess you've been friends with him.
[01:38:33.059 --> 01:38:37.222]  I mean, I would really love to see you at least, you know, come out and say, well, Donald Trump's better than Hillary.
[01:38:37.402 --> 01:38:38.223]  What's your view on that?
[01:38:39.164 --> 01:38:46.450]  Well, unfortunately, I'm not going to do that because I'm supporting Gary Johnson, the libertarian candidate for president who's better than both of them.
[01:38:47.656 --> 01:38:50.657]  I vote for the person that I want to be president.
[01:38:50.757 --> 01:38:52.698]  I don't vote against someone.
[01:38:52.718 --> 01:38:54.679]  I vote for someone.
[01:38:55.159 --> 01:38:59.080]  And I'm voting for Governor Johnson and Governor Weld.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:06.483]  I think that they're the best thing that could happen because they'll get us, number one, I vehemently oppose the wars in the Middle East.
[01:39:07.063 --> 01:39:12.244]  They are the only candidates, them and Dr. Stein, that'll get us out of the Middle East.
[01:39:12.845 --> 01:39:14.865]  And I oppose the war on drugs.
[01:39:15.385 --> 01:39:19.826]  And Gary Johnson's the only candidate that will stand up and attempt to end the war.
[01:39:19.846 --> 01:39:21.347]  Sure, what about how he's for the TPP?
[01:39:21.387 --> 01:39:22.707]  Donald's against the TPP.
[01:39:23.387 --> 01:39:24.868]  Well, that's wonderful.
[01:39:25.388 --> 01:39:30.909]  But Donald's also... I'm not for turning the United States into East Berlin.
[01:39:31.730 --> 01:39:32.550]  And Donald is.
[01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:37.277]  You know, I have bigger differences with Donald than I do with Gary Johnson.
[01:39:37.717 --> 01:39:39.841]  Therefore, I vote FOR someone.
[01:39:40.262 --> 01:39:45.511]  I will be voting FOR Gary Johnson, and I already endorsed Gary Johnson.
[01:39:46.391 --> 01:39:57.540]  I'll say this, I agree with a lot of what Gary Johnson has to say, but clearly the Koch brothers and the big money are now getting in there, more and more taking over the Libertarian Party because they don't want Trump in.
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:12.412]  I mean, I've never seen the power structure more scared of a candidate, but obviously if there wasn't third parties there, and I get your commitment and your integrity to build third parties for decades outside of the two-party system, so I think that's a legitimate point of view from your perspective, but clearly
[01:40:12.992 --> 01:40:26.079]  The power structure worldwide, the Communist Chinese President, the Pope, the Saudi Arabians, I mean, every criminal group crawling out from under rocks against Donald Trump.
[01:40:26.379 --> 01:40:28.801]  The power structure of the New World Order is really scary to him.
[01:40:30.287 --> 01:40:31.768]  Well, they might be, I don't know.
[01:40:31.928 --> 01:40:35.971]  But like I said, I don't vote against people, I vote for people.
[01:40:36.091 --> 01:40:41.756]  And to me, Gary Johnson is by far and away the best man that I want to be president.
[01:40:42.176 --> 01:40:44.017]  Donald Trump will continue the wars.
[01:40:44.138 --> 01:40:44.778]  Donald Trump.
[01:40:45.178 --> 01:40:49.401]  In fact, all the Republicans, in my opinion, should have been disqualified.
[01:40:49.442 --> 01:40:49.962]  You know why?
[01:40:49.982 --> 01:40:50.282]  Why?
[01:40:51.263 --> 01:40:53.264]  Because they all said they would torture.
[01:40:54.125 --> 01:40:59.129]  Every of the 16 Republican candidates all admitted they would commit a war crime.
[01:40:59.824 --> 01:41:00.604]  I'm a veteran.
[01:41:01.044 --> 01:41:09.707]  I take offense when a potential Commander-in-Chief admits, before they even become the Commander-in-Chief, that they will go out and commit war crimes.
[01:41:09.767 --> 01:41:11.387]  Well, I mean, that's one of my issues with Trump.
[01:41:11.467 --> 01:41:16.569]  His point is, he's informed, torture's still going on, and he's just being honest about it.
[01:41:17.309 --> 01:41:23.031]  Well, and that may be, but you don't join in, and because it's happening doesn't make it right.
[01:41:23.431 --> 01:41:24.171]  No, I hear you.
[01:41:24.951 --> 01:41:27.412]  And we as the United States should be above
[01:41:29.437 --> 01:41:32.239]  Listen, I agree with you, and then we get tortured, we lose the high ground.
[01:41:32.879 --> 01:41:42.304]  He's being honest, and I see his point, I don't agree with it, that these are ISIS, if you're admitted ISIS, and, you know, you're raping little girls and killing people, we're going to torture you to find out where your cohorts are.
[01:41:42.324 --> 01:41:45.305]  I mean, you know, that's kind of the line of thinking, and I think it's a bad line of thinking.
[01:41:45.445 --> 01:41:47.046]  That line of thinking's wrong!
[01:41:47.819 --> 01:41:48.820]  I hear you!
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:52.783]  That is wrong, because they've already proved torture doesn't get you.
[01:41:52.803 --> 01:41:53.304]  Okay, I got it.
[01:41:53.524 --> 01:41:56.667]  Now, you said you like Johnson because you're closer to him than Trump.
[01:41:56.987 --> 01:41:57.728]  What about Hillary?
[01:41:57.748 --> 01:42:00.410]  Do you agree with me that Hillary, though, is worse than Trump?
[01:42:01.731 --> 01:42:07.856]  I think both of these political parties and their candidates are as bad as each other.
[01:42:08.437 --> 01:42:11.359]  You're not going to get any advantage one over the other.
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:14.442]  Donald Trump is now a Republican, therefore you have
[01:42:16.298 --> 01:42:17.939]  The whole Republican Party came out against him.
[01:42:17.959 --> 01:42:18.479]  That's a good point.
[01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:22.441]  I don't know if he's like a rhino, like, uh, that'd be Paul Ryan, I think would be the biggest in-crowd guy.
[01:42:31.988 --> 01:42:33.969]  Well, Pence is right there with him.
[01:42:33.989 --> 01:42:35.070]  He's just a governor.
[01:42:35.150 --> 01:42:36.051]  That's the difference.
[01:42:36.151 --> 01:42:37.772]  Ryan's on the national scale.
[01:42:38.072 --> 01:42:39.553]  Pence is at the state level.
[01:42:39.994 --> 01:42:42.375]  Pence is as far right as you can get.
[01:42:42.735 --> 01:42:47.399]  He's another one of these guys that wants to, uh... He's opposed to... Let me ask you this then.
[01:42:47.459 --> 01:42:50.501]  Why is the establishment... He's opposed to all these social issues.
[01:42:50.521 --> 01:42:53.323]  He's a typical Republican that wants to be in your bedroom.
[01:42:54.003 --> 01:42:59.507]  But then Trump comes out and, you know, says we need to have equal rights for gays and lesbians in his main speech.
[01:42:59.547 --> 01:43:00.488]  So, that's Trump.
[01:43:01.257 --> 01:43:06.602]  Well, again, like I said, he still embraced the Republican Party, that makes him a Republican.
[01:43:06.642 --> 01:43:09.725]  Bernie Sanders is not an independent.
[01:43:09.785 --> 01:43:11.486]  Bernie Sanders is a Democrat.
[01:43:12.467 --> 01:43:13.348]  Yeah, Bernie Sanders.
[01:43:13.929 --> 01:43:16.931]  What did you think of him when they stole the nomination from him?
[01:43:17.732 --> 01:43:22.036]  Even Stanford Research Institute says no, it was stolen from him, and then he didn't even make a big deal out of it.
[01:43:22.549 --> 01:43:32.374]  Well, it's sad because, so I knew he wouldn't, because I spoke to Bernie over a year ago, and I asked him point blank, he gave me about a minute and cold shouldered me up in Minnesota.
[01:43:33.735 --> 01:43:40.259]  I asked him, if you fail to unseat Hillary, will you continue the movement as a third party or support a third party?
[01:43:40.679 --> 01:43:42.420]  He said, no, I will endorse Hillary.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:46.442]  Well, right there I knew, he's not an independent, he's a Democrat.
[01:43:47.063 --> 01:43:48.784]  He's masking as an independent.
[01:43:48.884 --> 01:43:49.504]  He's very arrogant.
[01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:51.693]  You know, he's a Democrat.
[01:43:52.033 --> 01:43:54.859]  The same way as Donald joining the Republicans.
[01:43:54.919 --> 01:43:56.282]  He's now a Republican.
[01:43:56.803 --> 01:43:59.147]  I wouldn't vote for a Republican or Democrat.
[01:44:00.632 --> 01:44:02.674]  No, I know.
[01:44:02.694 --> 01:44:04.997]  You're all about long-term breaking their monopoly.
[01:44:05.938 --> 01:44:06.919]  I hear you.
[01:44:06.959 --> 01:44:09.942]  We should have the other candidates in the debates.
[01:44:10.002 --> 01:44:12.004]  We really should have Gary Johnson.
[01:44:12.024 --> 01:44:12.604]  Exactly.
[01:44:12.685 --> 01:44:13.886]  Especially this year.
[01:44:14.406 --> 01:44:18.711]  This year, you got two candidates where their negatives are through the roof.
[01:44:18.911 --> 01:44:20.573]  Nobody likes either one of them.
[01:44:21.152 --> 01:44:29.380]  This is the year, if given a third choice up on that podium during the debates, you would see a ton of people switch to Gary Johnson.
[01:44:29.941 --> 01:44:33.044]  You'll see the Democrats and Republicans in bed together.
[01:44:33.064 --> 01:44:38.129]  They'll be in bed together stopping Johnson and Stein from getting in the debates.
[01:44:38.610 --> 01:44:41.753]  There they'll be singing Kumbaya by the fire together.
[01:44:48.413 --> 01:44:52.816]  John Repubs totally team up to keep Johnson and Stein out of debates.
[01:44:52.996 --> 01:44:56.898]  All four of those candidates should, and I'm an example, Alex.
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:02.383]  Because I was polling less than Gary Johnson's polling right now.
[01:45:03.103 --> 01:45:11.588]  I was polling 10% at Labor Day, I was allowed in the debates in Minnesota, and in 60 days I was the governor of Minnesota.
[01:45:11.608 --> 01:45:12.268]  You've got a point.
[01:45:12.588 --> 01:45:13.229]  You've got a point.
[01:45:13.849 --> 01:45:24.915]  If Gary Johnson had more personality like you, and he got in the debates, I think he'd probably be the winner because he has a lot less negatives, and frankly has a broader appeal overall with his message.
[01:45:25.335 --> 01:45:26.356]  That's a really good point.
[01:45:27.639 --> 01:45:32.920]  Yeah, but the point is, the Dems and Repubs ain't gonna allow him in because they know that, too.
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:37.381]  They know what I did in Minnesota, and they're not gonna repeat the same thing.
[01:45:37.681 --> 01:45:39.762]  Look what they did with the presidential debates.
[01:45:39.842 --> 01:45:45.983]  Up until 92, they were run by the National League of Women Voters, basically a non-partisan group.
[01:45:46.423 --> 01:45:54.385]  After Perot scared them, they formed the Federal Debate Commission, which is headed by the Dems and Repubs' former head, and they took over the debates.
[01:45:54.806 --> 01:45:56.886]  So, you got the Democrats and Republicans
[01:45:58.908 --> 01:45:59.888]  No, that's why I brought it up.
[01:46:02.551 --> 01:46:04.532]  Yes, but I agree with you.
[01:46:04.572 --> 01:46:08.795]  But look at how the Republican Party pulled out all the stops and tried to steal the nomination from Trump.
[01:46:08.856 --> 01:46:09.476]  He fought back.
[01:46:09.736 --> 01:46:10.277]  They failed.
[01:46:10.357 --> 01:46:16.542]  I see it more as an insurrection, a populist movement taking over the Republicans, at least until he brought Pence in.
[01:46:17.082 --> 01:46:20.205]  That was just to stop the Republicans from trying to totally overthrow him.
[01:46:20.465 --> 01:46:21.446]  But I get your point.
[01:46:21.806 --> 01:46:24.088]  He does a lot of great things and then does some bad things.
[01:46:24.628 --> 01:46:26.709]  But look at how the big money's giving him no money.
[01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:29.451]  We've never seen this in 50, 60 years.
[01:46:29.751 --> 01:46:32.974]  The Republican nominee getting no money from big interests.
[01:46:33.074 --> 01:46:34.975]  That is a big plus for Donald Trump.
[01:46:34.995 --> 01:46:37.256]  I mean, come on, Governor Ventura, give it to him.
[01:46:37.997 --> 01:46:40.078]  Well, certainly that's a plus for him.
[01:46:40.539 --> 01:46:45.322]  But I noticed that he's still going to big popular Republican fundraisers, though, isn't he?
[01:46:46.382 --> 01:46:48.384]  Well, he's going, like, to the $5,000 plate.
[01:46:48.484 --> 01:46:53.227]  Wait, I don't buy for an instant he's not getting supported by Republican
[01:46:54.086 --> 01:46:55.286]  He's not getting the Koch Brothers.
[01:46:55.346 --> 01:46:57.567]  He's not getting the big super packs.
[01:46:57.927 --> 01:46:59.688]  No big pharma.
[01:46:59.708 --> 01:47:05.990]  I mean, he's flying into places like Austin and Dallas and stuff, and it's $1,000, $2,000, $3,000 a plate.
[01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:07.450]  That's not establishment, people.
[01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:08.910]  That's pretty grassroots.
[01:47:09.731 --> 01:47:11.911]  He's not getting any big pharma, any big Wall Street.
[01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:16.070]  A lot of it is.
[01:47:16.130 --> 01:47:23.852]  The point is that the power structure is giving most of its money to Hillary.
[01:47:23.992 --> 01:47:25.772]  Alex, you and I are big to differ.
[01:47:25.792 --> 01:47:26.673]  You can vote for Trump.
[01:47:26.793 --> 01:47:28.373]  I'll vote for Gary Johnson.
[01:47:28.473 --> 01:47:29.153]  I'll say this.
[01:47:29.173 --> 01:47:29.393]  800-259-9231.
[01:47:29.413 --> 01:47:29.453]  800-259-9231.
[01:47:29.813 --> 01:47:32.494]  Quick questions for former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:47:32.834 --> 01:47:33.354]  Hey, listen.
[01:47:33.394 --> 01:47:35.255]  Now, if you were running for president, that'd be a different thing.
[01:47:35.335 --> 01:47:36.395]  But you didn't do it, did you?
[01:47:36.997 --> 01:47:37.737]  No, I did not.
[01:47:37.797 --> 01:47:39.178]  I couldn't go all in on it.
[01:47:39.698 --> 01:47:40.818]  I was up for the run.
[01:47:40.898 --> 01:47:45.459]  I was up to fight to get in the debates, but I wasn't up for doing the job for four years.
[01:47:45.539 --> 01:47:48.440]  And in those jobs, you've got to be 100 percent.
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:51.261]  Which makes your presidential material that you don't want the power.
[01:47:51.301 --> 01:47:52.682]  I mean, who wants that?
[01:47:53.302 --> 01:47:54.722]  Doesn't Hillary look ill to you?
[01:47:54.982 --> 01:47:56.223]  For age reasons.
[01:47:56.483 --> 01:48:02.244]  I'm 65 now, and I didn't want to have to clean up the Democrats and Republicans' mess for four years.
[01:48:02.764 --> 01:48:03.825]  I didn't make the mess.
[01:48:03.885 --> 01:48:04.405]  They did it.
[01:48:05.649 --> 01:48:06.569]  No, you get blamed for it.
[01:48:06.609 --> 01:48:08.690]  That's one thing if Trump gets in, he's going to get blamed for it all.
[01:48:08.710 --> 01:48:09.390]  That's a good point.
[01:48:09.410 --> 01:48:14.292]  Sure, just like Obama got blamed for all the crap George Bush did.
[01:48:14.312 --> 01:48:16.873]  Now, you know I'm no fan of Bush, but let's be honest.
[01:48:16.933 --> 01:48:21.254]  Bush was like half of what happened to Clintons, getting rid of Glass-Steagall.
[01:48:21.274 --> 01:48:24.075]  You did films on that, allowing all those huge debts.
[01:48:24.155 --> 01:48:26.796]  I mean, they're really to blame more than Bush for the economy.
[01:48:26.816 --> 01:48:30.957]  Well, granted, and in fact, I'll state this.
[01:48:31.617 --> 01:48:38.362]  Hillary Clinton's most important vote as a Senator was when she voted to go into the Iraq War.
[01:48:38.382 --> 01:48:39.143]  That's right.
[01:48:39.223 --> 01:48:42.125]  And now she's backpedaling saying it was her worst vote.
[01:48:42.185 --> 01:48:50.491]  Well, that alone disqualifies her for me because as Commander-in-Chief, her biggest thing was to go to war when it was wrong.
[01:48:51.651 --> 01:48:52.732]  And she did it as a senator.
[01:48:52.752 --> 01:48:54.073]  Hey, don't you feel vindicated?
[01:48:54.193 --> 01:48:55.654]  No thank you.
[01:48:55.774 --> 01:49:00.177]  You did a whole 9-11 show on the Saudi roll alone in the stand down and got criticized.
[01:49:00.217 --> 01:49:02.018]  Now it's all confirmed, so we're vindicated.
[01:49:02.859 --> 01:49:03.879]  Well, isn't that something?
[01:49:03.919 --> 01:49:07.662]  It's all confirmed now, but yet Jesse Ventura is still a crazy man.
[01:49:08.102 --> 01:49:16.868]  Jesse Ventura still goes after widows and children, you know, and yet everything I talk about comes out to be true ten years later.
[01:49:19.272 --> 01:49:19.392]  800-259-9231.
[01:49:19.912 --> 01:49:28.943]  I should be one of those people that make money where people come in and you look at the ball, the crystal ball.
[01:49:29.384 --> 01:49:30.785]  Let's talk to Bob in Connecticut.
[01:49:30.825 --> 01:49:32.567]  Bob, you're on the air with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:49:32.587 --> 01:49:32.848]  Go ahead.
[01:49:35.250 --> 01:49:37.451]  Go ahead, Mom.
[01:49:38.052 --> 01:49:40.813]  Jesse, the thing is this.
[01:49:40.893 --> 01:49:43.135]  You know, you asked to pull Gary Johnson.
[01:49:43.235 --> 01:49:46.276]  He picked as his vice presidential candidate.
[01:49:46.737 --> 01:49:47.617]  Hey, calm down.
[01:49:47.717 --> 01:49:49.158]  I can barely understand you, okay?
[01:49:49.178 --> 01:49:50.499]  Just don't yell, okay?
[01:49:50.759 --> 01:49:51.519]  Calm down, caller.
[01:49:51.559 --> 01:49:52.020]  Go ahead.
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:53.180]  I'm sorry.
[01:49:53.961 --> 01:49:58.723]  Jesse, Gary Johnson's vice presidential candidate, he's a gun grabber.
[01:50:00.602 --> 01:50:06.605]  This whole thing is, obviously you don't realize the precarious situation our country is in right now.
[01:50:06.965 --> 01:50:09.106]  This is going to be our last election.
[01:50:09.226 --> 01:50:13.687]  If Donald Trump does not win this election, America is done.
[01:50:14.007 --> 01:50:17.129]  Alright, let me get a mature take on that, Jesse.
[01:50:18.029 --> 01:50:23.471]  Well, first of all, I'm not buying into that because Donald Trump's a Republican.
[01:50:24.252 --> 01:50:27.193]  And you elect another Republican, you know?
[01:50:28.611 --> 01:50:29.112]  So what?
[01:50:29.792 --> 01:50:31.793]  And Hillary's a Democrat.
[01:50:31.993 --> 01:50:37.697]  I don't support either Democrats or Republicans, and it's my right to do that as a citizen of America.
[01:50:37.737 --> 01:50:40.819]  Well, listen, a big plus for you is you're totally pro-Second Amendment.
[01:50:41.399 --> 01:50:45.662]  And I have seen some evidence that Johnson's VP guy is not pro-gun.
[01:50:47.203 --> 01:50:50.605]  Well, maybe he is, maybe he isn't, but remember that's a VP.
[01:50:51.145 --> 01:50:53.387]  It's the President that matters, not the VP.
[01:50:54.527 --> 01:50:55.608]  And Johnson is pro-gun.
[01:50:56.767 --> 01:50:57.507]  I assume so.
[01:50:57.628 --> 01:50:59.248]  He's from New Mexico.
[01:50:59.569 --> 01:51:04.731]  No, I mean, I wouldn't call him a super hardcore guy like me, but he's pretty good.
[01:51:04.972 --> 01:51:10.995]  I mean, I'd call you a... Look at it this way... Hold on, Jesse, we gotta go to break.
[01:51:11.015 --> 01:51:16.318]  76-year-old veteran Peter Kazin shot himself this week in the parking lot of the VA Medical Center in Long Island.
[01:51:16.498 --> 01:51:25.303]  The hospital is part of the Veterans Affairs Medical System that has been under major scrutiny since 2014 for covering up long waiting times for veterans seeking medical care.
[01:51:25.543 --> 01:51:30.584]  He went to the ER and was denied service, one worker said, and then he went out to his car and he shot himself.
[01:51:30.824 --> 01:51:39.507]  His case is reminiscent of yet another veteran, a 51-year-old named Charles Ingram, who set himself on fire outside the Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic in New Jersey.
[01:51:39.527 --> 01:51:42.888]  A similar case of no access to care was given.
[01:51:43.428 --> 01:51:47.131]  One report says 22 veterans kill themselves every day in this country.
[01:51:47.391 --> 01:51:55.158]  President Obama said that no veteran should have to fill out a 23-page claim to get care or wait months or even years to get an appointment at the VA.
[01:51:55.258 --> 01:51:58.240]  Now he was a candidate, not president yet, when he said this.
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:05.066]  It looks like long after, into his presidency, little has changed for those who serve our nation when it comes to VA clinics in this country.
[01:52:05.086 --> 01:52:07.868]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:52:10.214 --> 01:52:11.235]  BrainForce is here.
[01:52:11.755 --> 01:52:14.037]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:52:14.297 --> 01:52:22.122]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:52:22.901 --> 01:52:26.484]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[01:52:26.504 --> 01:52:28.845]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[01:52:29.205 --> 01:52:32.728]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[01:52:32.768 --> 01:52:35.910]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[01:52:36.411 --> 01:52:41.194]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[01:52:41.754 --> 01:52:43.576]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[01:52:43.936 --> 01:52:48.339]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[01:52:48.519 --> 01:52:50.540]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[01:52:51.141 --> 01:52:52.622]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[01:52:52.762 --> 01:52:53.002]  Exactly.
[01:52:53.022 --> 01:52:57.006]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[01:52:57.326 --> 01:53:05.313]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:53:09.949 --> 01:53:11.749]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:53:11.829 --> 01:53:13.730]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:16.671]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:53:16.771 --> 01:53:22.632]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:53:22.832 --> 01:53:31.735]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:53:32.015 --> 01:53:36.876]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[01:53:37.116 --> 01:53:39.219]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:53:39.559 --> 01:53:47.269]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:48.550]  The general public doesn't.
[01:53:49.771 --> 01:53:52.092]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:53:53.712 --> 01:53:57.113]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:53:57.273 --> 01:54:03.735]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:54:03.975 --> 01:54:08.076]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[01:54:19.526 --> 01:54:21.126]  Alright, Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[01:54:21.386 --> 01:54:27.627]  Five more minutes left and we have the Republican Post writer that wrote about Hillary's medical problems and got fired, got banned.
[01:54:27.647 --> 01:54:29.748]  It just fits into all the censorship.
[01:54:30.188 --> 01:54:32.568]  More on the economy and a lot more of your phone calls as well.
[01:54:33.088 --> 01:54:34.429]  You got cut off by the break, Governor.
[01:54:34.469 --> 01:54:36.709]  Finish up with what you were saying about the Second Amendment or Johnson.
[01:54:37.489 --> 01:54:39.230]  Well, first of all, remember this.
[01:54:39.450 --> 01:54:47.131]  Libertarians, and that's who Gary Johnson's the presidential candidate for, believe in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:54:48.203 --> 01:54:51.950]  So you have no problem with the Second Amendment with Gary Johnson?
[01:54:52.759 --> 01:54:54.199]  I don't care who his VP is.
[01:54:54.599 --> 01:55:01.881]  Libertarians believe in the Constitution, and they believe in the Bill of Rights, and they hold those two documents sacred.
[01:55:02.301 --> 01:55:06.962]  That's all people need to know about Gary Johnson's position on the Second Amendment.
[01:55:07.022 --> 01:55:18.324]  Well, I understand what the Libertarians stand for, but politicians, you can go back on what they say a lot of times, so I don't... Well, that may be true, but Gary Johnson doesn't oppose the Second Amendment, I guarantee it.
[01:55:20.659 --> 01:55:24.122]  Anyway, let me go back to a thing in my trial for a moment, Alex.
[01:55:24.142 --> 01:55:24.202]  Yes.
[01:55:24.222 --> 01:55:26.224]  That's the truth that wasn't allowed.
[01:55:27.085 --> 01:55:32.389]  Okay, 2002 I was put on Heparin, Coumadin, blood thinners.
[01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:36.232]  I've been on them since 2002 and I'm still on them today.
[01:55:36.253 --> 01:55:43.138]  This alleged incident took place in 2006, where I would have been on blood thinners for four years.
[01:55:43.258 --> 01:55:48.403]  Kyle claimed he hit me, my head went down, struck a curb, and I didn't get up.
[01:55:49.628 --> 01:55:55.313]  Well, being on Coumadin, they wouldn't allow me to say that in court because I'm not a doctor.
[01:55:55.853 --> 01:56:06.402]  All I could state was I was on blood-thinning medication, which could be aspirin, even though I take it every day and have taken it for 16 frickin' years almost.
[01:56:06.842 --> 01:56:16.430]  Well, when we go back to court this time, I'm bringing doctors in who will say exactly that anyone on Coumadin who would be knocked out, hit their head on a curb,
[01:56:16.810 --> 01:56:20.855]  But you're also, you have more witnesses... I mean your words are in the break.
[01:56:20.935 --> 01:56:23.578]  Wait till I win with a second jury because I've got even more witnesses.
[01:56:24.039 --> 01:56:24.680]  Bombshell info.
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:26.222]  Plus they said that you were drunk.
[01:56:26.582 --> 01:56:27.924]  I mean I've been around you many many times.
[01:56:27.944 --> 01:56:28.865]  You don't drink.
[01:56:29.325 --> 01:56:33.451]  They didn't say I was drunk because you can't drink on Coumadin.
[01:56:34.251 --> 01:56:41.857]  What it was, was all of Kyle's witnesses were drunk, but they spent $1,100 on booze.
[01:56:41.957 --> 01:56:48.662]  My witnesses were sober, but these two judges chose to believe the drunks rather than the sober people.
[01:56:48.702 --> 01:57:00.110]  So I guess these two judges probably figured drunk driving laws are irrelevant because you've got your faculties even when you consume $1,100 worth of booze, which came out in the court case.
[01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:02.552]  He might have gotten so drunk he did think you did all this.
[01:57:05.148 --> 01:57:05.988]  May well be.
[01:57:06.049 --> 01:57:09.390]  Blackout, drunk, like, he wakes up, oh, you beat up Jesse Ventura.
[01:57:09.430 --> 01:57:10.751]  I was like, dude, whoa.
[01:57:11.331 --> 01:57:11.932]  Exactly.
[01:57:11.992 --> 01:57:13.373]  No, that all came out the case.
[01:57:13.853 --> 01:57:19.096]  Every one of them, their bill that night was $1,100 they spent on alcohol.
[01:57:19.116 --> 01:57:20.877]  And wasn't Kyle the head guy over the booze?
[01:57:21.892 --> 01:57:23.173]  No, I don't know who was.
[01:57:23.333 --> 01:57:23.993]  I went from memory.
[01:57:24.013 --> 01:57:25.094]  I don't really know.
[01:57:25.154 --> 01:57:25.915]  I can't verify that.
[01:57:26.195 --> 01:57:33.099]  Well, all I can say is it's a very entertaining movie that Clint Eastwood, and I know you've been a fan of Clint Eastwood a lot, but... Well, he's a friend.
[01:57:33.439 --> 01:57:33.639]  Yeah.
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:38.162]  Yeah, so I'm really, really glad that that part didn't end up in the movie.
[01:57:38.622 --> 01:57:42.505]  Well, it didn't because I'll give you an example during the court case real quick.
[01:57:43.129 --> 01:57:52.975]  The other side told me, they said, Mr. Ventura, would you be surprised to find out that your chapter's not in the first screenplay of the movie?
[01:57:53.475 --> 01:57:55.996]  And I looked at the other attorney, said, no, I'm not surprised.
[01:57:56.076 --> 01:58:03.921]  I said, we've written two letters to Warner Brothers stating that if my chapter's included in the movie, they will be next to be sued.
[01:58:05.427 --> 01:58:07.608]  So Warner Brothers, we put them on notice.
[01:58:07.628 --> 01:58:09.870]  I had to go to court to stop it from being in the movie.
[01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:10.270]  Yeah, we stopped it.
[01:58:10.290 --> 01:58:11.851]  We wrote Warner Brothers, and I've worked in L.A.
[01:58:11.871 --> 01:58:13.952]  They don't like to step into lawsuits.
[01:58:25.694 --> 01:58:28.420]  Well, it would ruin the movie, too, to have Jesse Ventura getting beat up in it.
[01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:29.522]  It's just total bull.
[01:58:29.583 --> 01:58:32.789]  You know if I wouldn't have gone to court, it would have been in the movie.
[01:58:32.850 --> 01:58:33.110]  Yeah.
[01:58:33.591 --> 01:58:34.613]  You know it would have.
[01:58:34.634 --> 01:58:35.656]  Well, listen, when's the RT show?
[01:58:37.617 --> 01:58:40.680]  Alex, that book had a pre-sale of, I think, 2,000.
[01:58:41.281 --> 01:58:47.868]  And the day Kyle went on TV and libeled me, it jumped to 100,000 in one day.
[01:58:48.048 --> 01:58:50.030]  No, no, they used defaming you to sell it.
[01:58:50.090 --> 01:58:50.491]  It's wrong.
[01:58:50.511 --> 01:58:51.612]  That's why we've always told the truth.
[01:58:51.632 --> 01:58:52.293]  You've been proven right.
[01:58:52.553 --> 01:58:53.274]  We stood beside you.
[01:58:53.634 --> 01:58:56.157]  Governor, come back on soon to talk about your RT show.
[01:58:56.197 --> 01:58:56.597]  Thank you.
[01:58:56.617 --> 01:58:58.319]  I sure will when I'm in New York.
[01:58:58.379 --> 01:58:58.819]  Bye-bye.
[01:58:58.980 --> 01:58:59.220]  Thank you.
[01:59:00.472 --> 01:59:06.796]  The official Black Lives Matter website vows to destroy the nuclear family and replace it with communist-style collective parenting.
[01:59:06.956 --> 01:59:08.417]  Black Lives Matter says, quote,
[01:59:17.782 --> 01:59:21.905]  And especially our children to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.
[01:59:22.025 --> 01:59:29.751]  Paul Joseph Watson points out that the notion of collective communities being responsible for children and not parents is an idea that has been pushed by the leftist establishment before.
[01:59:29.931 --> 01:59:35.355]  Most notably by MSNBC's Melissa Harris-Perry in which she claimed the notion that kids belonging to their parents was outdated.
[01:59:35.475 --> 01:59:45.303]  The Black Lives Matter pledge is a reminder that the movement funded by billionaire socialist George Soros is actually a Marxist front meant to sabotage western values more so than stopping police abuse.
[01:59:45.583 --> 01:59:55.109]  Instead of encouraging strong parenting in the black community, Black Lives Matter is telling parents that the traditional nuclear family is a bad idea and that they should give up control of their children.

[01:59:58.231 --> 01:59:59.552]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:00:02.754 --> 02:00:05.396]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:17.773 --> 02:00:21.195]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:21.736 --> 02:00:23.517]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.537 --> 02:00:34.604]  I get really sad now when I hear Merle Haggard.
[02:00:35.624 --> 02:00:38.546]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[02:00:39.467 --> 02:00:42.349]  And so the story ends, we're told.
[02:00:43.629 --> 02:00:45.971]  I shall need your prayers, it's true.
[02:00:47.893 --> 02:00:54.117]  People ask me, why are you going up against Hillary Clinton?
[02:00:54.157 --> 02:01:00.020]  Why are you really starting and supercharging a global movement against world government?
[02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:01.960]  These people have brought down scores of countries.
[02:01:01.981 --> 02:01:03.801]  They've murdered millions of people.
[02:01:04.262 --> 02:01:05.842]  What are you doing taking on George Soros?
[02:01:05.882 --> 02:01:06.923]  He's the guy behind Hillary.
[02:01:08.344 --> 02:01:09.144]  What do you got to prove?
[02:01:09.784 --> 02:01:11.785]  I'm not doing this to be macho or a tough guy.
[02:01:12.266 --> 02:01:14.047]  I'm only doing what I had to do.
[02:01:15.214 --> 02:01:21.838]  I cannot physically sit here and watch pure evil overrun everything when it admits it's pure evil.
[02:01:26.241 --> 02:01:28.943]  I wouldn't be risking my life if we had boss hog type corruption.
[02:01:28.963 --> 02:01:29.864]  I'd be criticizing it.
[02:01:30.444 --> 02:01:31.184]  I'd be against it.
[02:01:31.945 --> 02:01:34.486]  But I wouldn't be working seven days a week.
[02:01:35.247 --> 02:01:36.548]  I wouldn't be having nightmares about it.
[02:01:36.568 --> 02:01:37.769]  I wouldn't be up here risking my life.
[02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:39.830]  They're now announcing the end of free speech.
[02:01:39.850 --> 02:01:40.891]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[02:01:41.311 --> 02:01:44.313]  Notice I just had Ventura on, who I disagree with on about a third of things.
[02:01:46.101 --> 02:01:49.362]  Ventura's a smart guy, but he's also very, he'll tell you, blue-collar.
[02:01:50.922 --> 02:01:54.304]  And he looks at immigrants coming in, feels sorry for them, and says, I'll let them in.
[02:01:54.564 --> 02:02:00.605]  He doesn't get to being brought in, politicized, weaponized, signed on the Democratic Party to be used as an underclass.
[02:02:01.506 --> 02:02:06.027]  He just likes to, you know, kind of like Trump was, oh, bring the refugees in, they're Christians, they're getting killed.
[02:02:06.367 --> 02:02:08.828]  They went, no, sir, they're only bringing in the Sunnis that are running it all.
[02:02:09.228 --> 02:02:11.049]  And they're not checking their IDs.
[02:02:11.069 --> 02:02:13.109]  Well, stop them all, then, until it's fixed.
[02:02:17.816 --> 02:02:25.020]  Trump is sophisticated, almost idiot savant level, but there's a provincial blue-collar-ness down there as well.
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:34.544]  I mean, I've analyzed both these guys and... The establishment is freaking out and backing Gary Johnson.
[02:02:35.465 --> 02:02:36.846]  Koch brothers are in there backing him.
[02:02:37.166 --> 02:02:38.226]  I don't trust Gary Johnson.
[02:02:38.506 --> 02:02:40.547]  And by the way, I've had Gary Johnson on like 10 times.
[02:02:40.607 --> 02:02:42.088]  I've had him on like 6-7 times in person.
[02:02:42.468 --> 02:02:43.429]  And that guy changed.
[02:02:45.367 --> 02:02:47.428]  About four years ago when he'd come in here in the office.
[02:02:48.429 --> 02:02:59.514]  The last few times he was in here, and I mean, looking at me, and just going on there for the audience, but looking at me, like, I was just like, I don't want Johnson, if Johnson wants to come on, Johnson wants to come on.
[02:02:59.534 --> 02:03:00.575]  I'm like, nah, I don't like Johnson.
[02:03:01.655 --> 02:03:02.456]  That gives me the creeps!
[02:03:06.258 --> 02:03:08.179]  Notice the media's covering Johnson.
[02:03:08.199 --> 02:03:10.440]  They're not covering the Green Party lady, because she takes away from Hillary.
[02:03:13.086 --> 02:03:16.187]  Trump is the third party taking over the Republicans.
[02:03:16.727 --> 02:03:17.387]  And that's a fact.
[02:03:17.407 --> 02:03:24.228]  I want to play this clip of our guest that's coming up here because he has been massively censored, David Seaman.
[02:03:25.388 --> 02:03:31.309]  He was a guest on it a long time ago, but he wrote a lot of articles and posts and he just, well, here he is talking about it.
[02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:37.770]  We're going to break playing this clip of, you know, I think we had a computer problem there.
[02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:41.151]  It's been glitching and not helping to post where I was a contributor.
[02:03:41.869 --> 02:03:49.312]  They have revoked my publishing access and they've deleted both of my articles that were published earlier over the weekend.
[02:03:50.052 --> 02:03:55.534]  Both of my articles have been pulled without notice of any kind, just completely deleted from the internet.
[02:03:56.854 --> 02:04:06.338]  And both of those articles mentioned Hillary's health, which is both a hashtag on Twitter and I linked to a video that a YouTuber, Paul Joseph Watson,
[02:04:07.466 --> 02:04:07.566]  Yes.
[02:04:25.071 --> 02:04:25.391]  That's right.
[02:04:25.411 --> 02:04:26.152]  We're gonna be back.
[02:04:52.868 --> 02:05:03.837]  We're going to talk to this gentleman in person straight ahead, but it's all part of a unified program of censorship which they admit is to be run by the United Nations and George Soros.
[02:05:04.498 --> 02:05:05.519]  We have the emails.
[02:05:06.319 --> 02:05:09.242]  That's right, a weirdo Nazi collaborator is going to run your life.
[02:05:10.777 --> 02:05:11.778]  BrainForce is here.
[02:05:12.318 --> 02:05:14.599]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:05:14.879 --> 02:05:22.683]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:05:23.464 --> 02:05:26.606]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[02:05:26.906 --> 02:05:27.046]  Right?
[02:05:27.066 --> 02:05:29.408]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[02:05:29.768 --> 02:05:33.270]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[02:05:33.330 --> 02:05:36.472]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[02:05:36.972 --> 02:05:41.755]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[02:05:42.315 --> 02:05:44.136]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[02:05:44.497 --> 02:05:48.919]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[02:05:49.079 --> 02:05:51.081]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[02:05:51.721 --> 02:05:53.182]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[02:05:53.322 --> 02:05:53.562]  Exactly.
[02:05:53.582 --> 02:05:57.365]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[02:05:57.885 --> 02:06:05.870]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:06:10.558 --> 02:06:16.723]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:06:17.104 --> 02:06:19.986]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:06:20.326 --> 02:06:25.531]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:06:25.931 --> 02:06:31.916]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:06:32.056 --> 02:06:35.199]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:06:35.339 --> 02:06:36.800]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:06:36.980 --> 02:06:41.124]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:06:41.324 --> 02:06:44.186]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:06:44.266 --> 02:06:45.828]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:06:45.928 --> 02:06:49.131]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:06:49.411 --> 02:06:51.733]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:06:52.013 --> 02:06:52.974]  It's in powder form.
[02:06:53.054 --> 02:06:55.756]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:06:55.937 --> 02:06:56.537]  I take this.
[02:06:56.657 --> 02:06:58.339]  This is the product that I take.
[02:06:58.459 --> 02:07:00.441]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:07:01.241 --> 02:07:02.022]  We fight the Globals.
[02:07:02.042 --> 02:07:02.922]  We fight the New World Order.

[02:07:10.847 --> 02:07:17.191]  The official Black Lives Matter website vows to destroy the nuclear family and replace it with communist-style collective parenting.
[02:07:17.331 --> 02:07:27.977]  Black Lives Matter says, quote, we are committed to disrupting the Western prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and villages that collectively care for one another.
[02:07:28.157 --> 02:07:32.260]  And especially our children to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.
[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:40.127]  Paul Joseph Watson points out that the notion of collective communities being responsible for children and not parents is an idea that has been pushed by the leftist establishment before.
[02:07:40.307 --> 02:07:45.731]  Most notably by MSNBC's Melissa Harris Perry in which she claimed the notion that kids belonging to their parents was outdated.
[02:07:45.851 --> 02:07:55.679]  The Black Lives Matter pledge is a reminder that the movement funded by billionaire socialist George Soros is actually a Marxist front meant to sabotage western values more so than stopping police abuse.
[02:07:55.959 --> 02:08:05.484]  Instead of encouraging strong parenting in the black community, Black Lives Matter is telling parents that the traditional nuclear family is a bad idea, and that they should give up control of their children.
[02:08:05.724 --> 02:08:08.466]  For more reports, visit InfoWars.com.
[02:08:08.606 --> 02:08:09.907]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:08:20.641 --> 02:08:24.042]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:25.303 --> 02:08:42.969]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:43.029 --> 02:08:47.571]  So I might as well
[02:08:49.289 --> 02:08:51.391]  To put some action in my life!
[02:08:51.411 --> 02:08:54.513]  Now that's what Hillary Clinton's doing.
[02:08:54.573 --> 02:08:55.394]  Breaking the law.
[02:08:56.115 --> 02:08:56.915]  Breaking the law.
[02:08:57.135 --> 02:08:57.856]  Breaking the law.
[02:08:58.617 --> 02:09:07.464]  Breaking the law so hardcore and involving all these big government agencies and all these foreign leaders that she thinks she's too corrupt to fail.
[02:09:09.025 --> 02:09:12.408]  Like a cancer that's metastasized into the entire body politic.
[02:09:13.615 --> 02:09:17.457]  And if you try to cut it out, it's in the lungs, it's in the heart, it's in the bones, it's in the brain!
[02:09:18.517 --> 02:09:20.458]  It's in the blood itself!
[02:09:22.879 --> 02:09:24.620]  Until the body politic dies.
[02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:29.762]  By then, Hillary Clinton would have already shuffled off her mortal coil.
[02:09:32.283 --> 02:09:40.707]  I will tell you, it is very, very creepy to have a woman who
[02:09:42.828 --> 02:09:50.377]  I get triggered by, and by that I don't go into, you know, feministic spasms or hot flashes or anything.
[02:09:52.139 --> 02:10:01.390]  But when I see Hillary Clinton making joker faces and doing her hyena laugh, and I see her different activities, it upsets me.
[02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:02.732]  My blood pressure goes up.
[02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:12.435]  I can just see an image of her when they have the website up on screen and it's upsetting because this is really a bad person.
[02:10:12.956 --> 02:10:19.882]  It'd be like if I had a neighbor who I caught robbing my garage twice and who I caught doing other bad stuff, you get irritated seeing that neighbor.
[02:10:21.484 --> 02:10:22.345]  I've had neighbors like that.
[02:10:23.906 --> 02:10:24.927]  You know they stole your bike.
[02:10:25.087 --> 02:10:25.628]  You catch them.
[02:10:26.829 --> 02:10:31.093]  They claim they don't know why your bike is in their backyard and their kid's using it.
[02:10:31.997 --> 02:10:33.518]  And you catch him robbing you again.
[02:10:34.078 --> 02:10:35.619]  You just move out of the neighborhood.
[02:10:35.939 --> 02:10:37.980]  Or you see them move and you go, oh, thank God.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.100]  And you talk to their landlord and they weren't paying their rent.
[02:10:42.321 --> 02:10:46.763]  We had some juvenile delinquent when I was a kid in Dallas when we moved when I was five.
[02:10:47.383 --> 02:10:51.925]  But it was a blue collar neighborhood, upper blue collar, but still blue collar.
[02:10:51.945 --> 02:10:54.546]  And he was robbing stuff and breaking into things.
[02:10:54.646 --> 02:10:55.867]  And he finally got arrested.
[02:10:57.256 --> 02:11:02.101]  But it was just to see his family deny, he was like four doors down, deny it, and he was Joey.
[02:11:02.621 --> 02:11:05.464]  Deny and deny and deny the robberies, and then finally he got busted.
[02:11:06.045 --> 02:11:14.233]  It's like Hillary is a criminal who's committed all these crimes.
[02:11:15.669 --> 02:11:22.813]  And she's there in front of you, and she won't get out of your life, and she won't go away, and I've got real Hillary Clinton fatigue!
[02:11:23.213 --> 02:11:24.414]  They just put her on screen right there.
[02:11:24.434 --> 02:11:26.995]  That arrogant, joker face.
[02:11:27.015 --> 02:11:33.119]  I mean, I'll be honest, watching that Batman movie would, uh, late.
[02:11:34.671 --> 02:11:43.379]  Actor who played Joker, he looked so drugged out, so upset, so depressed, so crazy that you find it disquieting.
[02:11:43.439 --> 02:11:45.060]  I mean, clowns are disquieting.
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:48.423]  And that movie irritates me because I don't want to look at the Joker.
[02:11:48.883 --> 02:11:50.685]  With Hillary, it's 50 times worse.
[02:11:50.745 --> 02:11:52.306]  This woman tortures me.
[02:11:52.626 --> 02:11:58.972]  If you wanted to torture me, you'd put me in a cell with TV screens around me with Hillary Clinton giggling like a hyena.
[02:12:00.737 --> 02:12:09.708]  And this is who the power structure, who we know is a criminal and has committed all these crimes, and now the Chinese president, she was having people pay for access to him?
[02:12:12.412 --> 02:12:13.714]  It just gets worse and worse.
[02:12:13.734 --> 02:12:14.695]  It's totally criminal!
[02:12:15.696 --> 02:12:18.560]  And what does it say that the mainstream media in unity?
[02:12:21.069 --> 02:12:34.868]  The mainstream media is covering up for her en masse, and you will go to the New York Times or CNN.com, and I'm telling you, there'll be 50, 60, 70 articles, every one of them attacking Donald Trump.
[02:12:37.438 --> 02:12:43.943]  I'm going to hold my guest until about 45 after, 40 after, and then we can take some calls if folks want to hold, if not, drop off, but I'm going to be able to go to your calls for a while.
[02:12:43.983 --> 02:12:44.764]  I appreciate you calling in.
[02:12:44.804 --> 02:12:46.385]  I'm just happy to get to our guest.
[02:12:46.906 --> 02:12:48.067]  I covered this in the first hour.
[02:12:48.127 --> 02:12:50.028]  I have hundreds of articles that are super important.
[02:12:50.048 --> 02:12:52.811]  I'll mention some of these, but really front and center is this.
[02:12:56.877 --> 02:12:59.239]  They have a system of internet censorship used in China.
[02:12:59.579 --> 02:13:10.249]  It's an internet ID, it's an internet social score, where you basically get blacklisted off the web if you criticize the government or global corporations or groups that this system is protecting.
[02:13:10.569 --> 02:13:24.621]  The system ends net neutrality, but not just for traffic going over systems, for certain carriers or certain websites or certain outlets, but if you're a patriot, a nationalist, whoever they don't like, you are not allowed to basically even use the internet.
[02:13:26.522 --> 02:13:31.325]  DC Leaks Website Down, Twitter Suspended After Releasing Soros Docs.
[02:13:31.385 --> 02:13:33.486]  Daily Caller, linked on InfoWars.com.
[02:13:33.947 --> 02:13:35.648]  An Internet Giveaway to the U.N.
[02:13:36.908 --> 02:13:37.449]  If the U.S.
[02:13:37.529 --> 02:13:40.951]  advocates Internet Stewardship, the United Nations may take control.
[02:13:41.211 --> 02:13:43.012]  They got the four-year documents, that's what it does.
[02:13:43.052 --> 02:13:43.553]  We told you.
[02:13:44.453 --> 02:13:45.074]  The U.N.'
[02:13:45.054 --> 02:13:46.695]  's been lobbying for this forever.
[02:13:47.775 --> 02:13:48.776]  Soros Document.
[02:13:48.936 --> 02:13:53.419]  Regulate Internet to Favor Open Society Supporters and Only Let Their Information Out.
[02:13:53.539 --> 02:13:54.579]  Push the NGOs.
[02:13:54.659 --> 02:13:55.280]  Force Feed It.
[02:13:56.858 --> 02:14:00.622]  Just like you get Obama force feeds on your quote smart phone or your computer.
[02:14:01.162 --> 02:14:05.506]  They actually say you'll get force feeds from the UN and it'll be George Soros.
[02:14:06.207 --> 02:14:10.170]  Just like they say the UN's now with strong cities gonna direct local police.
[02:14:10.931 --> 02:14:12.292]  That's not me embellishing.
[02:14:12.572 --> 02:14:14.554]  That's what Loretta Lynch said.
[02:14:16.676 --> 02:14:17.397]  It's happening.
[02:14:18.439 --> 02:14:22.302]  They're reaching the point of the final construction of this thing.
[02:14:22.662 --> 02:14:25.284]  They've already built the foundation and the superstructure.
[02:14:25.684 --> 02:14:27.185]  They're loading it up right now.
[02:14:28.546 --> 02:14:31.168]  The Pope's meeting with Zuckerberg to discuss all this.
[02:14:31.589 --> 02:14:32.069]  It's here.
[02:14:33.410 --> 02:14:35.932]  They're globalist Manhattan Project squared.
[02:14:39.076 --> 02:14:44.539]  And then you have Huffington Post, banned journalist for writing about Hillary's health, deletes article.
[02:14:45.219 --> 02:14:48.221]  He's talking about a video that now has 4 million views, just on one platform.
[02:14:48.541 --> 02:14:49.342]  Millions on others.
[02:14:49.422 --> 02:14:52.363]  It's been played on Fox News, other channels.
[02:14:52.763 --> 02:14:54.284]  It's totally legitimate to cover.
[02:14:58.667 --> 02:15:01.108]  He writes an article about it and they delete it.
[02:15:02.583 --> 02:15:05.164]  Again, this just shows how these people operate.
[02:15:05.184 --> 02:15:16.831]  There is a criminal instinct, a mob instinct of what you call leftist now that is just far from liberal values this country or world's ever seen.
[02:15:17.451 --> 02:15:18.872]  They're about as liberal as a mouse to tongue.
[02:15:19.332 --> 02:15:21.634]  In fact, that's who's popular on the college campuses.
[02:15:21.894 --> 02:15:37.386]  But all funded by weirdo rich billionaires that want monopolies, overthrow countries, starve people, put radical jihadis in charge, and you tell the little trendies this, they don't care because they go, I'm with it, I'm with it, even though they're delusional and aren't with it.
[02:15:37.406 --> 02:15:39.487]  We have a new Mark Dice video on InfoWars.com.
[02:15:39.527 --> 02:15:40.368]  Then we're going to our guest.
[02:15:43.570 --> 02:15:46.653]  Mark Dice goes out and every idiot he talks to doesn't even know.
[02:15:47.662 --> 02:15:49.523]  Who the Vice President is.
[02:15:51.605 --> 02:15:53.586]  But they say they're Democrats, so they're intellectual.
[02:15:53.846 --> 02:15:56.608]  These people can't find their butts with both hands.
[02:15:57.208 --> 02:15:58.329]  But let me tell you something.
[02:15:58.749 --> 02:15:59.970]  They know how to run your life.
[02:16:00.451 --> 02:16:01.471]  They wreck California.
[02:16:01.511 --> 02:16:02.332]  They come to Austin.
[02:16:02.532 --> 02:16:06.575]  They're so stupid, they don't even know why they're fleeing the place they have soiled.
[02:16:09.537 --> 02:16:15.901]  Our guest, one more journalist, written scores of articles over the years for The Huffington Post, been a guest on with us in 2014 in September.
[02:16:19.721 --> 02:16:21.162]  Thought criminal, David Seaman.
[02:16:21.523 --> 02:16:24.726]  He joins us to talk about this.
[02:16:24.786 --> 02:16:29.050]  And of course, there are plenty of stories about McCain's health, plenty of stories about Donald Trump's health, mental health.
[02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:31.592]  You can say he's crazy all over the news with no evidence.
[02:16:33.354 --> 02:16:34.155]  But he joins us.
[02:16:34.215 --> 02:16:35.496]  David Seaman, thanks for coming on.
[02:16:36.637 --> 02:16:38.439]  This is the season of the rollout of censorship.
[02:16:38.499 --> 02:16:39.120]  Am I wrong?
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:40.061]  Talk about what happened to you.
[02:16:41.573 --> 02:16:50.397]  Yeah, thank you for having me on, Alex, and thank you for being one of the first and one of the biggest news sites to cover this, along with a few others.
[02:16:50.477 --> 02:16:56.259]  We Are Change got out there front and center as well, but InfoWars was definitely one of them.
[02:16:56.479 --> 02:16:57.500]  And when this happened to me,
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:16:59.421]  It didn't feel good.
[02:16:59.441 --> 02:17:02.404]  There was like a pit in my stomach because this is what I do for a living.
[02:17:02.464 --> 02:17:03.185]  I'm a journalist.
[02:17:03.245 --> 02:17:03.925]  I'm a pundit.
[02:17:04.005 --> 02:17:04.906]  I'm a researcher.
[02:17:04.926 --> 02:17:11.232]  For people who haven't been following me much, I used to appear on a bunch of cable shows and shoots.
[02:17:11.953 --> 02:17:13.994]  I was on CNN programs often.
[02:17:14.635 --> 02:17:17.418]  Anderson Cooper once gave me career advice on the air.
[02:17:18.358 --> 02:17:29.008]  I was on Wolf Blitzer, where they played a video of me on Wolf Blitzer that Valerie Jarrett had to respond to, where I was saying that Obama's performance I would rate as a D or an F, and this was some years ago.
[02:17:29.028 --> 02:17:34.734]  I used to go on Fox News every once in a while, so, you know, I'm just a media pundit.
[02:17:34.774 --> 02:17:36.536]  I'm just a guy who does this stuff.
[02:17:37.416 --> 02:17:45.844]  And I've been doing online media for years, and I've never seen anything like this where your articles are deleted without any prior discussion from an editor who manages you.
[02:17:46.204 --> 02:17:51.509]  Just deleted late on a Sunday night, and then you log in, and your account has been completely revoked.
[02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:52.450]  The gloves are off!
[02:17:52.470 --> 02:17:57.315]  I mean, have you ever seen media as just a solid wall of disinformation act like this?
[02:17:57.375 --> 02:18:00.257]  I'm really impressed by their discipline.
[02:18:00.658 --> 02:18:01.839]  I mean, this is Nazi-like.
[02:18:02.995 --> 02:18:22.510]  Well, the reason why I immediately put out a video explaining what had happened, and I put it on my personal YouTube channel, and although the views are, as you know yourself, the views are staggered, the public views, but when I log in, the actual number of views since yesterday is 67,000 views, and so that gave me a lot of confidence.
[02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:25.832]  That I have some personal safety, because I wanted to get the truth out there.
[02:18:25.852 --> 02:18:39.883]  It would be very simple after being so dishonest that you would delete two articles that are completely factually correct, completely grammatically correct, nothing offensive to minorities, no profane language, not trying to step on anybody's toes.
[02:18:40.503 --> 02:19:04.450]  But, you know, bringing up the subject of Hillary Clinton's health and linking out to that video which has been viewed millions of times, it's not even my own video, not even my own content or research, it's pretty much just first-hand footage of Mrs. Clinton and of that head spasm or seizure or whatever the experts deem it to be, whatever that is and whatever those other montages were, they are certainly not normal, right?
[02:19:04.830 --> 02:19:10.414]  So that's all I was doing is raising a bit of awareness with a couple of quick posts that took me 20 minutes.
[02:19:10.754 --> 02:19:13.996]  And I had no idea that my publishing privileges would be revoked.
[02:19:14.296 --> 02:19:22.842]  And there's a real impact on me professionally because not only does it look reputationally bad to be promoting an article that people click on and see it's been deleted and censored away.
[02:19:23.822 --> 02:19:35.785]  Now, I can no longer go to certain conferences, and it's going to be harder to get access to certain sources, because I no longer... Well, it's okay, because what happens is, like Sheryl Atkinson getting fired from CBS, you get another job.
[02:19:35.825 --> 02:19:38.445]  Maybe we should have you do some contract work for us.
[02:19:38.465 --> 02:19:40.566]  We're going to come right back from break with David Seaman.
[02:19:40.986 --> 02:19:44.886]  I've written tons of articles for The Huffington Post over the years, censored for just saying, hey, look at this viral video.
[02:19:45.087 --> 02:19:47.987]  That's what news is supposed to be, is, hey, this is a big story.
[02:19:48.287 --> 02:19:49.367]  What do you think about this?
[02:19:49.387 --> 02:19:51.828]  Let's go out to break, showing a clip of Hillary's real health.
[02:19:55.319 --> 02:20:00.380]  Okay.
[02:20:00.420 --> 02:20:02.300]  Keep talking.
[02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:04.801]  She looks profoundly young.
[02:20:05.961 --> 02:20:06.461]  It's okay.
[02:20:06.521 --> 02:20:07.061]  It's all right.
[02:20:07.081 --> 02:20:07.421]  It's all right.
[02:20:07.441 --> 02:20:16.883]  Somebody said something to you in the crowd.
[02:20:16.903 --> 02:20:19.544]  We'll be back.
[02:20:19.764 --> 02:20:21.184]  Hillary Clinton is desperate.
[02:20:22.133 --> 02:20:30.061]  Donald Trump was 10 points ahead in the polls until Reuters and others began sampling 10 to 15 percent more Democrats in their polls to skew the numbers.
[02:20:30.361 --> 02:20:30.922]  It's incredible.
[02:20:31.222 --> 02:20:40.411]  But despite all that skewing in the last two weeks, now in major polls put up by the very same groups with the same methodology, Trump is neck and neck with her or even a point or two ahead.
[02:20:40.931 --> 02:20:46.336]  But if you go look at the social media, and Breitbart and Gateway Pundit have done this, it's incredible.
[02:20:47.057 --> 02:20:56.365]  We're talking three, four, five, six times the support at places like Facebook, Livestream, Reddit, and so many other places.
[02:20:56.625 --> 02:21:00.509]  In fact, sometimes he's got ten times more likes and ten times more views.
[02:21:01.149 --> 02:21:04.932]  That's what we saw with Bernie Sanders, where he'd have 20,000 people, Hillary'd have 500.
[02:21:05.713 --> 02:21:14.361]  We did exit polls in California and other so-called battleground states in the Democratic primary, and we talked to eight people before we found one or two Hillary supporters.
[02:21:14.901 --> 02:21:18.142]  That's why Hillary was forced to steal it with the superdelegates.
[02:21:18.802 --> 02:21:20.402]  Let's look at some of the numbers themselves.
[02:21:21.323 --> 02:21:26.204]  Trump had 10 million plus likes to Clinton's 5 million on Facebook.
[02:21:26.564 --> 02:21:34.386]  And that's with Facebook admittedly censoring Trump pages everywhere they can and even meeting with Hillary Clinton just like Google does.
[02:21:35.327 --> 02:21:43.172]  Trump averages 30,000 live viewers per stream, and Clinton averages 500 live stream viewers per stream.
[02:21:43.612 --> 02:21:48.015]  On Reddit, Trump averages 197,000 plus subscribers, Hillary 24,000.
[02:21:48.495 --> 02:21:52.938]  Hillary for prison has 55,000 subscribers.
[02:21:53.198 --> 02:21:54.479]  Gee, wonder who started that.
[02:21:55.079 --> 02:21:59.082]  And this is only a snapshot of the numbers we're seeing with Trump.
[02:21:59.502 --> 02:22:03.044]  You go to YouTube, his average video has millions of views.
[02:22:04.085 --> 02:22:06.487]  You go look at Hillary's official campaign site.
[02:22:07.047 --> 02:22:08.968]  Most of her videos have 2,000 or 3,000 views.
[02:22:09.028 --> 02:22:10.489]  Her bigger one's a few hundred thousand.
[02:22:10.829 --> 02:22:11.990]  This lady's a joke.
[02:22:12.370 --> 02:22:13.711]  She's not liked by her own party.
[02:22:14.011 --> 02:22:20.695]  But we're being told it's going to be a landslide for her because they're trying to get us ready for election fraud.
[02:22:21.076 --> 02:22:24.218]  Something so well documented in this country's past.
[02:22:25.398 --> 02:22:27.440]  But Obama says it's preposterous.
[02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:29.721]  He doesn't even know what that is.
[02:22:30.521 --> 02:22:32.463]  Well, President Obama, we do know what it is.
[02:22:33.260 --> 02:22:39.142]  And this time, we don't have somebody like Mitt Romney or John McCain who's gonna stand down and not take action.
[02:22:39.462 --> 02:22:41.602]  We don't have somebody who's gonna throw in the towel there's fraud.
[02:22:41.862 --> 02:22:46.144]  We got Donald Trump and an awake population that's aware of your scams.
[02:22:47.204 --> 02:22:48.864]  The social engineers have jumped the shark.
[02:22:49.285 --> 02:22:51.305]  They are stealing this election in front of everyone.
[02:22:52.185 --> 02:22:55.986]  By forcing them to engage in fraud, we are exposing them forever.
[02:22:56.347 --> 02:23:00.968]  So even if Donald Trump loses, even if that happens due to fraud,
[02:23:01.943 --> 02:23:02.483]  Or scandals.
[02:23:02.884 --> 02:23:11.711]  It doesn't matter, because we've been in the arena, we've politically exposed the system, political correctness, globalism, the maxim has been introduced, Americanism, not globalism.
[02:23:12.491 --> 02:23:14.573]  This is a good time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:23:14.933 --> 02:23:20.998]  And we owe Donald Trump so much for being willing to put his family, his life, his treasure on the line.
[02:23:21.419 --> 02:23:22.660]  He is the man in the arena.
[02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:25.002]  And I'm honored to be in that arena with him as well.
[02:23:25.482 --> 02:23:30.066]  If you haven't joined us in this historic fight, it's time to pick a side right now.
[02:23:40.732 --> 02:23:42.273]  Our talk show host is Alex Jones.
[02:23:42.333 --> 02:23:44.214]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:23:44.294 --> 02:23:47.016]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:23:47.216 --> 02:23:48.037]  Alex Jones.
[02:23:48.117 --> 02:23:50.879]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:23:50.939 --> 02:23:54.141]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:23:54.161 --> 02:23:55.482]  Deeply I think racist.
[02:23:55.582 --> 02:23:57.443]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[02:23:57.543 --> 02:23:59.344]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[02:23:59.364 --> 02:24:03.447]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[02:24:03.467 --> 02:24:04.628]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:04.688 --> 02:24:09.611]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:24:24.239 --> 02:24:35.306]  Since my video went viral and catapulted Hillary's health back into the national spotlight, we've seen more examples of Clinton behaving bizarrely, completely losing her wits mid-sentence.
[02:24:35.427 --> 02:24:45.574]  We need to make what we've got work really well, and improve it, and get the costs out of... an upward spiral of...
[02:24:49.341 --> 02:24:50.702]  A upward spiral.
[02:24:50.783 --> 02:24:52.644]  Nearly falling over again.
[02:24:59.371 --> 02:25:01.814]  Referring to Trump as her husband.
[02:25:02.054 --> 02:25:07.459]  You will compare what I'm proposing to what my opponent is talking about.
[02:25:07.679 --> 02:25:11.063]  Having to be calmed by a mysterious Secret Service agent.
[02:25:14.392 --> 02:25:19.559]  He also carries around a weird syringe, which some speculate carries an anti-seizure drug.
[02:25:19.639 --> 02:25:23.223]  The re-emergence of photos from February... Alright, let's start trading that down.
[02:25:23.283 --> 02:25:25.386]  That's another one of his latest viral videos.
[02:25:25.426 --> 02:25:26.267]  There's three or four of them.
[02:25:26.287 --> 02:25:27.689]  They've got tens of millions of views total.
[02:25:28.697 --> 02:25:29.638]  We have some breaking news.
[02:25:29.698 --> 02:25:32.099]  I'll keep Mr. Seaman with us into the next segment.
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:35.702]  During the break, Buckley came in and said, hey, what do you want to do about this?
[02:25:36.323 --> 02:25:38.204]  Motherboard, The Hill, they're all calling you.
[02:25:38.664 --> 02:25:39.845]  And I instantly saw what it was.
[02:25:39.885 --> 02:25:42.727]  Went and talked to our IT people and our hacker specialist folks.
[02:25:43.168 --> 02:25:47.231]  We have the report on hacking, not hackers, even though we just got the Stingray documents and everything else.
[02:25:47.251 --> 02:25:50.513]  But the point is, is that in 2012,
[02:25:52.995 --> 02:25:54.956]  It was actually a year before that, we'd know about it for a while.
[02:25:55.076 --> 02:26:01.957]  Somebody was able to get in and get some real emails of people that had signed up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:26:03.118 --> 02:26:03.798]  But that was it.
[02:26:04.398 --> 02:26:07.579]  And then they mixed in a bunch of names and other stuff with it and put it out.
[02:26:08.559 --> 02:26:11.580]  And of course we just told folks about it and it was a patch and no big deal, thank God.
[02:26:13.004 --> 02:26:23.287]  And thank God most hackers are white hat folks that are actually out there exposing, you know, the ClimateGate and Hillary and George Soros and how they stole the election from Bernie Sanders and so much more.
[02:26:23.307 --> 02:26:28.168]  But I tell you, the story here is that Motherboard and others got trolled.
[02:26:28.528 --> 02:26:30.208]  They're putting this out that this just happened.
[02:26:30.568 --> 02:26:34.529]  This happened actually in 2011 and we reported on it in 2012.
[02:26:37.020 --> 02:26:38.380]  So that's what's going on.
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:45.162]  This is how desperate they are to shut us down, how desperate they are to engage in economic warfare and try to stir up trouble.
[02:26:45.622 --> 02:26:54.725]  And it's why it's more important than ever to flood the site with support, spread the word about our articles and videos, buy the Hillary for Prison shirts at cost right now.
[02:26:56.983 --> 02:27:00.226]  Shipping and handling and the shirt $9.95, no shipping added.
[02:27:01.226 --> 02:27:03.188]  Get BioTrue Selenium.
[02:27:03.808 --> 02:27:06.710]  From our research, the very best, most organic selenium anybody can get out there.
[02:27:07.071 --> 02:27:08.292]  It's so important in the body.
[02:27:08.912 --> 02:27:19.120]  We've got the vitamin, mineral fusion, amino acid, fruit punch that's so important that you give to yourself and your family and others at 20% off right now.
[02:27:20.868 --> 02:27:23.070]  At Infowarslife.com or Infowarsstore.com.
[02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:24.431]  This is what I'm trying to explain to people.
[02:27:24.651 --> 02:27:26.692]  This is an all-out war going on right now.
[02:27:26.993 --> 02:27:35.599]  Going back to a victim of this, where are you going from here now that you dare report on a video that even CNN was reporting on, but you're the little minion.
[02:27:35.619 --> 02:27:37.520]  You're not allowed to actually talk about it.
[02:27:37.540 --> 02:27:44.245]  You'd think the Huffington Post would actually want the traffic generated off of that, but they have a scorched-earth policy now of censorship.
[02:27:44.265 --> 02:27:46.187]  What do you make of George Soros' emails coming out that
[02:27:46.727 --> 02:27:56.495]  He wants the UN and others to control the web and not let those of us that disagree with them have access and give special treatment to his news organizations like the Huffington Post.
[02:27:56.755 --> 02:27:57.256]  It's right here.
[02:27:57.276 --> 02:28:14.930]  Well, I don't know much about the Soros Foundation or him in particular, but I can tell you that my experience with Huffington Post, especially given the fact that they have been so liberal with me, the traditional version of the word liberal, they've been so liberal in what they've allowed me to publish,
[02:28:15.891 --> 02:28:20.435]  And I primarily cover cryptocurrency and gold and sound money stuff.
[02:28:20.455 --> 02:28:38.432]  I'm interested in Bitcoin and some of the newer crypto networks like Ethereum that people think will eventually be able to outdo, possibly things like Bitcoin will be able to somehow outdo, the corrupt centralized content silos like Facebook where we all have to store our information and interact with each other.
[02:28:38.992 --> 02:28:47.956]  We're not making any money off of that stuff and where our information is being divulged to, you know, God knows what number of agencies and governments and even corporations.
[02:28:48.937 --> 02:28:50.598]  So that was my focus.
[02:28:50.638 --> 02:28:55.020]  This is just a couple of quick posts and I was blown away that that's the end of your career.
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:57.021]  That's the level of arrogance.
[02:28:57.561 --> 02:29:03.005]  As you were saying in the last break, there is a level of just contempt for the average person.
[02:29:03.045 --> 02:29:04.246]  Like, I'm just some journalist.
[02:29:04.286 --> 02:29:07.588]  We'll just run you over, and you don't have a career anymore.
[02:29:07.608 --> 02:29:08.488]  You look like a joke.
[02:29:08.749 --> 02:29:10.069]  We'll move on to the next person.
[02:29:10.089 --> 02:29:14.192]  We'll find somebody in their early 20s, and they'll write this crap moving forward.
[02:29:14.753 --> 02:29:16.093]  And that's really toxic.
[02:29:16.134 --> 02:29:17.835]  That's really not what America is about.
[02:29:18.215 --> 02:29:23.018]  That's not America's heritage, journalism-wise, when you go back to people like Edward R. Murrow.
[02:29:23.078 --> 02:29:23.418]  That's right.
[02:29:23.458 --> 02:29:24.979]  The tyrants are making their move.
[02:29:26.340 --> 02:29:27.141]  The First Amendment.
[02:29:27.461 --> 02:29:28.021]  That's right.
[02:29:28.041 --> 02:29:28.242]  Stay there.
[02:29:28.262 --> 02:29:31.003]  I'm going to come out and give you the floor for about five minutes to roll with all this.
[02:29:31.524 --> 02:29:40.550]  David Seaman, a victim of the massive censorship that is taking place, ladies and gentlemen, because he dared talk about reality and say, look at this big story.
[02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:41.871]  It's in mainstream news.
[02:29:42.944 --> 02:29:46.848]  About Hillary's health, and they're like, bye bye, down the rabbit hole.
[02:29:47.629 --> 02:29:51.452]  This is how they operate, and it's only going to get worse.
[02:29:51.472 --> 02:29:55.276]  I want to talk about how we counter this, with David Seaman straight ahead.
[02:29:55.356 --> 02:29:57.718]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[02:29:58.159 --> 02:29:59.440]  Visit it while you still can.
[02:29:59.740 --> 02:30:00.661]  We're on the march.
[02:30:01.122 --> 02:30:02.723]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.664 --> 02:30:06.367]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.017 --> 02:30:14.420]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:25.449]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:30:25.609 --> 02:30:30.532]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:30:30.652 --> 02:30:33.174]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:30:33.234 --> 02:30:34.715]  It helps detoxify.
[02:30:34.935 --> 02:30:37.756]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:30:37.836 --> 02:30:42.579]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:30:42.599 --> 02:30:46.722]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[02:30:47.162 --> 02:30:48.824]  ...dependent upon selenium.
[02:30:48.844 --> 02:30:54.169]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:30:54.289 --> 02:30:55.711]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[02:30:55.911 --> 02:30:56.632]  This is so key.
[02:30:56.892 --> 02:31:01.197]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:31:01.217 --> 02:31:03.299]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:31:03.439 --> 02:31:06.902]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:31:10.721 --> 02:31:16.089]  76-year-old veteran Peter Kazin shot himself this week in the parking lot of the VA Medical Center in Long Island.
[02:31:16.289 --> 02:31:25.082]  The hospital is part of the Veterans Affairs medical system that has been under major scrutiny since 2014 for covering up long waiting times for veterans seeking medical care.
[02:31:25.322 --> 02:31:30.369]  He went to the ER and was denied service, one worker said, and then he went out to his car and he shot himself.
[02:31:30.609 --> 02:31:39.301]  His case is reminiscent of yet another veteran, a 51-year-old named Charles Ingram, who set himself on fire outside the Department of Veterans Affairs clinic in New Jersey.
[02:31:39.321 --> 02:31:42.706]  A similar case of no access to care was given.
[02:31:43.206 --> 02:31:46.929]  One report says 22 veterans kill themselves every day in this country.
[02:31:47.169 --> 02:31:54.956]  President Obama said that no veteran should have to fill out a 23-page claim to get care or wait months or even years to get an appointment at the VA.
[02:31:55.056 --> 02:31:58.019]  Now he was a candidate, not president yet, when he said this.
[02:31:58.339 --> 02:32:04.865]  It looks like long after, into his presidency, little has changed for those who serve our nation when it comes to VA clinics in this country.
[02:32:04.885 --> 02:32:07.647]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:32:10.037 --> 02:32:11.398]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:32:11.678 --> 02:32:12.979]  You can't survive without it.
[02:32:13.179 --> 02:32:14.079]  But where do you get it?
[02:32:14.379 --> 02:32:20.123]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:32:20.363 --> 02:32:26.066]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:32:26.266 --> 02:32:43.133]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:32:43.533 --> 02:32:45.653]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:32:46.014 --> 02:32:47.214]  Stainless fuel construction.
[02:32:47.474 --> 02:32:48.254]  Easy assembly.
[02:32:48.514 --> 02:32:49.134]  Low maintenance.
[02:32:49.434 --> 02:32:51.254]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:33:20.258 --> 02:33:21.960]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.361 --> 02:33:23.862]  Because there is a war on.
[02:33:24.323 --> 02:33:25.244]  For your mind.
[02:33:37.788 --> 02:33:42.010]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sitting here during the break trying to think of words strong enough to describe what we're watching.
[02:33:42.030 --> 02:33:43.210]  We're watching a new kind of war.
[02:33:43.811 --> 02:33:50.814]  21st century, technotronic, pre-programmed systems of censorship and control.
[02:33:50.914 --> 02:33:58.477]  And we have the emails, and the admissions, and the New York Times telling Facebook, censor more, kill Donald Trump.
[02:34:00.922 --> 02:34:01.902]  I mean, it's all happening.
[02:34:01.922 --> 02:34:06.984]  We're seeing a true authoritarian instinct from the so-called left, which I know can manifest in the right as well.
[02:34:07.024 --> 02:34:07.764]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:34:09.305 --> 02:34:11.686]  Even the Libertarian Party's getting taken over right now by the globalists.
[02:34:12.166 --> 02:34:14.947]  And our guest, David Seaman, has been kicked off
[02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:22.913]  The Huffington Post for simply talking about the fact that Hillary Clinton's health or non-health issues is one of the biggest stories in the country.
[02:34:23.553 --> 02:34:26.214]  That's newsworthy, even if you disagree with it or agree with it.
[02:34:26.594 --> 02:34:30.656]  Even though he conformed to writing it very dryly, that wasn't enough.
[02:34:32.436 --> 02:34:33.977]  You've got to go along with their agenda.
[02:34:33.997 --> 02:34:38.879]  And then it comes out that Dr. Drew, why was Dr. Drew fired, was the number one Google search last week.
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:44.061]  Because people now know he was fired for saying, I'm worried about Hillary.
[02:34:44.081 --> 02:34:45.382]  You know, she looks bad.
[02:34:46.752 --> 02:34:49.378]  What she's got, the drugs they say they're giving her, it'll kill you.
[02:34:49.398 --> 02:34:50.401]  You're not supposed to take them together.
[02:34:52.205 --> 02:34:54.891]  So, going back to our guest to finish up his point.
[02:34:55.713 --> 02:34:56.715]  Go ahead, David Seaman.
[02:34:57.844 --> 02:35:00.966]  Yeah, Dr. Drew in particular has been with CNN for so long.
[02:35:01.426 --> 02:35:03.447]  I think his show has been running for six years.
[02:35:03.527 --> 02:35:05.909]  And then, you know, I grew up listening to him on Loveline.
[02:35:06.689 --> 02:35:08.650]  He and Adam Carolla had a radio show.
[02:35:09.651 --> 02:35:15.954]  So to just boot Dr. Drew off the air like that, when what he said was, I thought, quite coherent.
[02:35:16.034 --> 02:35:18.256]  You know, the guy is a medical professional.
[02:35:19.236 --> 02:35:23.499]  And don't you want a medical expert to sound off on this stuff and not just people like me?
[02:35:23.719 --> 02:35:26.821]  You know, it makes sense to want to hear what Dr. Drew would have to say.
[02:35:27.661 --> 02:35:32.785]  But anyway, before the break, you'd ask me, I think, like, what can we do about this stuff?
[02:35:33.206 --> 02:35:34.447]  And I have no idea, really.
[02:35:34.527 --> 02:35:42.373]  Obviously, you know, I'm becoming more and more a supporter of Trump because I don't see the same kind of manipulation coming out of his campaign.
[02:35:42.393 --> 02:35:52.541]  And as I joked on Twitter, half-joked anyways, even when I criticize Donald Trump, I don't have any fear that he's going to try to kill me or he's going to try to, you know,
[02:35:53.001 --> 02:36:12.869]  Mangle my career in some way or slow me down as we've seen if Donald Trump doesn't like you He just calls you out on Twitter on social media and then picks the bones clean, you know He will completely destroy you but he's not in the business of stacking up a body count and I got some very disturbing messages last night from people who
[02:36:13.749 --> 02:36:17.931]  I think some were genuinely concerned about my health and well-being after that whole thing.
[02:36:18.292 --> 02:36:20.793]  But some people it seemed like psychological harassment almost.
[02:36:20.893 --> 02:36:22.374]  It was like, oh, you poor little thing.
[02:36:22.494 --> 02:36:28.137]  Look, I had Jimmy Kimmel come out and say the New World Order is basically going to kill you, Alex Jones, and make it a joke.
[02:36:28.397 --> 02:36:31.839]  But he just had a mass murderer on days before who he was defending.
[02:36:31.899 --> 02:36:35.061]  See, they're getting off on the idea of tyranny, David.
[02:36:35.261 --> 02:36:36.662]  So your instinct is absolutely right.
[02:36:37.745 --> 02:36:41.709]  Yeah, I think at least 10-20% of these messages were what I consider as harassment.
[02:36:42.569 --> 02:36:43.650]  It's all happening, you know.
[02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:51.998]  I used to think that people like you were crazy, and then gradually I came to the conclusion that you're some of the few people doing real journalism in the United States anymore.
[02:36:52.018 --> 02:37:02.388]  Because CNN, that laughing clip of Hillary that you played earlier from Paul Watson's video, that laughing clip of her on CNN, that was Jake Tapper who interviewed her.
[02:37:02.868 --> 02:37:11.456]  And as kind of lightweight and useless as that interview was, how useful is it to just have 30 seconds of somebody laughing in such a shrill way?
[02:37:12.257 --> 02:37:17.182]  As useless as that sit-down was to begin with, it's a sit-down with a compromised person.
[02:37:17.282 --> 02:37:27.852]  You know, in the DNC leaks that WikiLeaks came out with, you know, I'd argue that the lack of coverage of this latest WikiLeaks batch is probably the biggest news story in the country at the moment.
[02:37:28.312 --> 02:37:40.506]  It's one of the biggest in a decade, but what's even bigger is that the media is totally ignoring it or spinning it when it's so bombshell, and unified lying is really, it's so lockstep, it's horrifying.
[02:37:41.620 --> 02:37:42.461]  It is horrifying.
[02:37:42.501 --> 02:37:44.782]  It makes you feel like you're on the outside looking in.
[02:37:44.802 --> 02:37:50.365]  And with, you know, Jake Tapper, the nature of that relationship, there he is right there.
[02:37:50.405 --> 02:37:52.846]  That's Jake Tapper waving his hand at the sheet of paper.
[02:37:53.366 --> 02:37:56.788]  Based on the WikiLeaks emails, he should be out of a job.
[02:37:56.908 --> 02:37:59.770]  They can fill that show with somebody else very quickly.
[02:38:00.410 --> 02:38:01.911]  Uh, he is not irreplaceable.
[02:38:01.951 --> 02:38:02.992]  He should be out of a job.
[02:38:03.052 --> 02:38:05.634]  He is compromised or his producers are compromised.
[02:38:06.054 --> 02:38:09.076]  But it's inappropriate to already be that close to the TNC.
[02:38:09.436 --> 02:38:15.260]  And then to host an interview where the only question posed is to let her just laugh until the time runs out.
[02:38:15.300 --> 02:38:17.522]  She runs out the clock with that absurd laughter.
[02:38:18.222 --> 02:38:24.146]  And, uh, you know, there are a lot of people like me who are not going to put our careers ahead of what's right anymore.
[02:38:24.186 --> 02:38:25.747]  We're just going to say it as we see it.
[02:38:26.408 --> 02:38:28.329]  And it's clear that something is going on.
[02:38:28.349 --> 02:38:29.290]  I was about to say.
[02:38:30.110 --> 02:38:33.832]  Just like when the Nazis started bombing civilian targets, they thought it would make the British give up.
[02:38:34.172 --> 02:38:37.413]  It made the British go from not wanting to be in the war to wanting to go into the war.
[02:38:37.433 --> 02:38:47.757]  And I don't know why tyrants from Tokyo Rose to Hillary Clinton think threatening people, talking about my dark heart, trying to sick her, you know, minions on me, how she thinks it's gonna make me give up.
[02:38:47.837 --> 02:38:50.598]  It's only gonna make me fight that much harder and have more energy.
[02:38:50.618 --> 02:38:51.759]  I mean, they don't get it.
[02:38:51.859 --> 02:38:53.619]  We know you're a mass murderer, Hillary.
[02:38:53.659 --> 02:38:54.640]  We know you're a killer.
[02:38:55.180 --> 02:39:00.504]  Some of us have to stand up, and now you've made it so clear for us, there's really no mistake.
[02:39:00.544 --> 02:39:02.986]  Well listen, I want you to go on doing your journalism.
[02:39:03.286 --> 02:39:05.268]  Do it on your own, as the censored person.
[02:39:06.209 --> 02:39:08.310]  Submit pieces to InfoWars, we'd love to carry it.
[02:39:08.851 --> 02:39:12.554]  Let us talk to you in the next few days about doing some work with us.
[02:39:13.214 --> 02:39:15.896]  That's how you counter these people, is we build our own systems.
[02:39:16.197 --> 02:39:20.240]  Just like Matt Drudge said, we get out of their internet ghettos, we get out of their systems.
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:26.225]  I understand using them for a while because they've kind of given themselves the attention, but we're already bigger than they are overall.
[02:39:26.526 --> 02:39:28.047]  Let's leave Babylon.
[02:39:28.067 --> 02:39:28.968]  Let's come out of Egypt.
[02:39:29.288 --> 02:39:30.590]  David Seaman, we'll talk to you again soon.
[02:39:31.581 --> 02:39:34.102]  Thank you, and I would love to take you up on that offer.
[02:39:34.142 --> 02:39:34.963]  We'll be calling you today.
[02:39:35.343 --> 02:39:36.183]  That's a great idea.
[02:39:36.203 --> 02:39:37.924]  We're trying to get a few auxiliary folks.
[02:39:37.984 --> 02:39:45.108]  They don't have a big budget, but we do have paid people here, and we're trying to hire a few more writers and reporters that want to just report on news and have integrity.
[02:39:45.148 --> 02:39:46.469]  We don't even micromanage what you say.
[02:39:46.869 --> 02:39:48.330]  Just don't attack little people.
[02:39:48.570 --> 02:39:51.411]  Cover big stories, investigative journalism, we've got to review it.
[02:39:52.272 --> 02:39:55.454]  But if you're just commentating on big news stories out there, that's what we're looking for.
[02:39:56.994 --> 02:40:01.115]  Now, I'm going to play this piece, then come back and take calls if you want to hold, but I've got to air it.
[02:40:01.175 --> 02:40:02.075]  I aired it yesterday.
[02:40:04.456 --> 02:40:05.296]  It's so important.
[02:40:05.756 --> 02:40:07.456]  Alex Jones asked Hillary Clinton not to kill him.
[02:40:07.916 --> 02:40:09.357]  That's the headline they gave it on the website.
[02:40:09.557 --> 02:40:11.877]  Really, I said to Hillary Clinton, please stop killing people.
[02:40:12.677 --> 02:40:14.938]  Or you could say, this is the video Hillary Clinton doesn't want you to see.
[02:40:14.958 --> 02:40:16.838]  We're going to get to it in just a moment.
[02:40:16.878 --> 02:40:24.360]  But please understand, never before is it more clear to everyone, I've known that InfoWars has been the tip of the spear because I was the only one, I guess,
[02:40:25.455 --> 02:40:27.537]  With the type of platform and who was willing to do it.
[02:40:29.039 --> 02:40:30.300]  It's not even a courage issue.
[02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:32.863]  It kind of sounds nasty to say all this stuff, even though it's true.
[02:40:33.423 --> 02:40:35.045]  It's almost like cuss words, the things we talk about.
[02:40:35.085 --> 02:40:35.445]  I get it.
[02:40:35.946 --> 02:40:36.506]  It's obscene.
[02:40:36.847 --> 02:40:37.528]  I'm not doing it.
[02:40:37.548 --> 02:40:38.669]  I'm reporting on what's happening.
[02:40:38.889 --> 02:40:40.210]  It's still an obscene program.
[02:40:40.290 --> 02:40:40.651]  I get it.
[02:40:41.672 --> 02:40:42.413]  But truth is truth.
[02:40:43.996 --> 02:40:47.697]  And now, I mean, look, I've known we've been the tip of the spear for ten years at least, okay?
[02:40:47.877 --> 02:40:48.797]  Tip of the spear.
[02:40:49.277 --> 02:40:51.438]  Only thing more effective in punching through was Drudge.
[02:40:51.898 --> 02:40:56.559]  Now Drudge, working, you know, linking to our stories, changes history.
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:40:59.300]  And now you see everybody else going our direction.
[02:40:59.340 --> 02:41:00.540]  That's why the system's panicking.
[02:41:00.580 --> 02:41:02.021]  We're mainlining reality.
[02:41:02.561 --> 02:41:06.142]  We broke through the confidence game that there's no world government and none of this is happening.
[02:41:07.139 --> 02:41:08.260]  We need your support, though.
[02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:11.082]  Your prayers, spreading the words about the links, the videos, everything.
[02:41:11.142 --> 02:41:12.303]  I'm risking my life to do this.
[02:41:13.064 --> 02:41:14.085]  I don't want to do it and fail.
[02:41:14.185 --> 02:41:15.006]  I know we can win.
[02:41:15.206 --> 02:41:15.806]  You can win.
[02:41:16.407 --> 02:41:27.456]  HillaryForPrisonShirts, at cost, InfoWarsStore.com, Operation Dark Heart, making a joke off what she said about me last week, 20% off on the Vitamin Mineral Fruit Punch multivitamin.
[02:41:28.117 --> 02:41:30.859]  We've got a lot of other specials running right now on InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:41:32.301 --> 02:41:40.866]  Or InfowarsStore.com, and it's your purchases that allow me to, quite frankly, get more reporters, anchors, and people in place in case Hillary does kill me.
[02:41:41.186 --> 02:41:46.289]  And the media, notice, hadn't made jokes about this shit, because everybody knows that Clintons want people to know they're killers.
[02:41:47.190 --> 02:41:47.450]  Okay.
[02:42:06.633 --> 02:42:10.497]  You kill Spartacus, 10,000 more stand up and say, I am Spartacus, Hillary.
[02:42:10.517 --> 02:42:14.801]  I mean, you have your mentor that pledged himself to Lucifer.
[02:42:15.442 --> 02:42:16.023]  You're a freak!
[02:42:16.523 --> 02:42:17.885]  And somebody's got to say no to you.
[02:42:18.405 --> 02:42:19.166]  So please support us.
[02:42:19.226 --> 02:42:20.227]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:42:20.247 --> 02:42:22.910]  The new film, Marageddon, is also out as well.
[02:42:22.930 --> 02:42:25.232]  We're going to go ahead and go to this report.
[02:42:25.292 --> 02:42:25.933]  Hillary Clinton.
[02:42:26.654 --> 02:42:27.775]  Again, please stop killing people.
[02:42:30.185 --> 02:42:36.890]  Before the Clintons left their governorship in Arkansas, more than a hundred people had been suspiciously murdered.
[02:42:37.851 --> 02:42:40.413]  Hundreds more died during their first terms.
[02:42:41.194 --> 02:42:43.355]  And the scourge continues to this day.
[02:42:44.376 --> 02:42:53.723]  DNC staffer after DNC staffer that speaks out against election fraud or leaks information to WikiLeaks ends up gunned down.
[02:42:54.624 --> 02:42:58.867]  And the Clinton crime family and their backers is now in the spotlight.
[02:43:00.108 --> 02:43:04.290]  If I die, if they kill me, it was done for a worthy cause.
[02:43:05.130 --> 02:43:07.111]  Somebody's gotta stand up against these people.
[02:43:08.131 --> 02:43:19.316]  Long before George W. Bush had taken office, or Senator Obama was even thinking about being president, I was there, exposing the crimes of the Clintons.
[02:43:20.136 --> 02:43:27.159]  So it is fitting that I, Alex Jones, called the Dark Heart by Hillary Clinton, would be your chronicler.
[02:43:28.019 --> 02:43:33.342]  A chronicler who risked his very life exposing these evil ones.
[02:43:33.642 --> 02:43:35.323]  It's required by Bill Clinton in 1992.
[02:43:35.443 --> 02:43:37.504]  And it was instituted here in Texas in 1993.
[02:43:38.024 --> 02:43:38.885]  I know the code, sir.
[02:43:38.985 --> 02:43:41.486]  Are you going to institute his urine and blood testing when he commands you?
[02:43:42.086 --> 02:43:45.028]  Are you going to stick a needle in my arm when I have no criminal record?
[02:43:45.628 --> 02:43:55.493]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[02:43:56.564 --> 02:44:09.707]  Just a few days ago, Hillary Clinton, one of the most powerful criminal kingpins in history, came out on national television and said that I had a horrible, dark heart.
[02:44:10.327 --> 02:44:16.749]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[02:44:18.309 --> 02:44:21.070]  I am committed to standing up against oppression and tyranny.
[02:44:22.110 --> 02:44:23.070]  That's just who I am.
[02:44:24.171 --> 02:44:25.371]  But I've got to be honest with you.
[02:44:26.573 --> 02:44:33.034]  I thought back to the history of the Clinton's reign of criminal terror in the last 20 plus years on this planet.
[02:44:33.814 --> 02:44:43.976]  And I have to tell you, it's surreal to realize that Alex Jones, little old me, is one of the main opposition points against these monsters.
[02:44:45.136 --> 02:44:54.998]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[02:44:56.141 --> 02:45:00.905]  Hillary Clinton is famous for her death threats, both public and private.
[02:45:01.365 --> 02:45:08.150]  Back in 2008, even the New York Times had the headline, Clinton's remark on Kennedy's killing stirs uproar.
[02:45:08.691 --> 02:45:18.999]  When Obama was way ahead of her in the primary polls, she said it doesn't matter because Bobby got assassinated before the primary ended.
[02:45:19.839 --> 02:45:25.223]  My husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary.
[02:45:26.405 --> 02:45:27.907]  Somewhere in the middle of June, right?
[02:45:28.708 --> 02:45:33.395]  We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.
[02:45:35.498 --> 02:45:41.247]  This is the type of bloodthirsty rhetoric that we continually see from Hillary Clinton.
[02:45:42.446 --> 02:45:56.989]  Years later, after she had successfully conned the world into bombing Libya to give Al-Qaeda air cover, Hillary, after landing in Tripoli, bragged that she came, she saw, and Gaddafi died.
[02:45:57.769 --> 02:46:00.249]  Yes, we came, we saw, he died.
[02:46:00.289 --> 02:46:03.890]  Did it have anything to do with your visit?
[02:46:03.990 --> 02:46:05.830]  No, I'm sure it did.
[02:46:07.131 --> 02:46:08.611]  I want to go back to the beginning.
[02:46:10.111 --> 02:46:18.240]  Governor Bill Clinton and his co-governor wife supported George Herbert Walker Bush and the 1991 war in Iraq.
[02:46:18.821 --> 02:46:20.683]  But from there, it only got worse.
[02:46:21.924 --> 02:46:31.408]  Once they were in the White House, they expanded the bombing to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of attacks a year on the infrastructure of Iraq.
[02:46:31.868 --> 02:46:44.574]  They got the UN to pass the most draconian sanctions ever in modern history, where medicine and food and all forms of technology were basically blocked from coming into the country.
[02:46:45.534 --> 02:46:49.596]  Over a million and a half Iraqis starved to death and died.
[02:46:50.676 --> 02:47:04.825]  And Hillary Clinton's mentor, Madeleine Albright, bragged on 16 Minutes and other channels that 500,000 dead Iraqi children were a good price to pay of the sanctions.
[02:47:05.845 --> 02:47:08.187]  We have heard that half a million children have died.
[02:47:09.047 --> 02:47:13.230]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[02:47:14.290 --> 02:47:17.172]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[02:47:18.197 --> 02:47:22.740]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:27.203]  The population implodes, refugees flee across the world.
[02:47:28.324 --> 02:47:42.073]  A once pro-Western secular Muslim nation had begun its path to being taken over by jihadis, which Hillary, a decade plus later, would facilitate in happening.
[02:47:42.956 --> 02:47:48.818]  Let's remember here, the people we are fighting today, we funded 20 years ago.
[02:47:49.899 --> 02:47:53.480]  Let's go back again to 1995 and 1999.
[02:47:54.801 --> 02:48:04.805]  You have the Croats, you have the Serbs, you have the Muslims of the South in Albania, you have the Balkans, the Russians have pulled out after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Clintons
[02:48:07.708 --> 02:48:13.930]  Back Islamicists out of Albania and Croats, this is on record, to attack Serbia.
[02:48:14.891 --> 02:48:30.977]  When Serbia fights back, even though they lost twice as many people, the Clintons launch giant bombing raids and NATO invasions that blow up power plants, water treatment plants, TV stations with depleted uranium bombs.
[02:48:32.435 --> 02:48:34.519]  Radiating the entire area.
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:41.892]  Then they had British television broadcast images of what's admitted now to be fake Serb concentration camps.
[02:48:43.186 --> 02:48:59.591]  The Clintons are the most hated couple in Serbia and the Balkans because the Serbs were the most powerful allies of America and Madeleine Albright in that region, the Secretary of State who ran this whole operation that bragged about 500,000 kids is no big deal.
[02:49:00.451 --> 02:49:04.552]  Her father and her were saved from the Nazis by the Serbs.
[02:49:05.074 --> 02:49:07.616]  A lot of you younger women don't think you have to.
[02:49:08.296 --> 02:49:08.997]  It's been done.
[02:49:09.137 --> 02:49:10.518]  It's not done.
[02:49:10.878 --> 02:49:11.979]  And you have to help.
[02:49:12.359 --> 02:49:14.921]  Hillary Clinton will always be there for you.
[02:49:15.541 --> 02:49:20.544]  And just remember, there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other.
[02:49:22.746 --> 02:49:31.812]  But when you are a Machiavellian sociopath, or a sadistic psychopath, like George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, and others,
[02:49:32.864 --> 02:49:36.408]  You don't look at things about alliances and who's right and who's wrong.
[02:49:36.908 --> 02:49:39.051]  You look at a billion plus Muslims.
[02:49:39.772 --> 02:49:41.313]  And you look at Syria.
[02:49:42.034 --> 02:49:47.160]  And you look at the invasion points where you can come into all of Europe and take over.
[02:49:48.301 --> 02:49:50.503]  But first you've got to get the weapons to invade.
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:50:01.329]  And you see Libya, and Muammar Gaddafi, who for eight years previous to the Western attack, had invested in the West, brought the West in, and decided to go the route of detente.
[02:50:01.789 --> 02:50:02.450]  He was set up.
[02:50:02.890 --> 02:50:09.136]  Jihadists out of Saudi Arabia, via the State Department and Hillary, this is all mainstream news now, were brought into Benghazi.
[02:50:09.196 --> 02:50:10.157]  They attacked the country.
[02:50:10.537 --> 02:50:13.640]  The West had a bombing campaign to back the takeover.
[02:50:14.020 --> 02:50:15.561]  Islamists were put in control.
[02:50:16.182 --> 02:50:16.722]  Christians
[02:50:17.822 --> 02:50:22.667]  Blacks, non-radical Muslims, Shiites and others were killed by the tens of thousands.
[02:50:23.248 --> 02:50:26.832]  And Hillary formed, by design, a failed state.
[02:50:27.172 --> 02:50:30.656]  We came, we saw, he died.
[02:50:33.387 --> 02:50:36.268]  You look at the before and after images, it is simply incredible.
[02:50:36.468 --> 02:50:38.189]  And Hillary admits it's a failed state.
[02:50:38.710 --> 02:50:46.993]  They took the weapons, the Stinger missiles, the TOW missiles, and moved them to Syria to knock down the gates to Europe.
[02:50:47.534 --> 02:50:53.877]  You take over Syria, you can bring in all the jihadis out of Saudi Arabia and other areas, invade Europe.
[02:50:55.299 --> 02:51:05.484]  And then use the Islamic threat to ban free speech of those that criticize it and use the civil emergency to bring in a permanent form of martial law.
[02:51:06.405 --> 02:51:22.414]  To be fair to Hillary Clinton, she's only a puppet of George Soros, who even the Jerusalem Post has recently reported, due to the WikiLeaks documents, is nothing but a megalomaniac who thinks he's the Messiah, establishing world government through chaos he sows.
[02:51:23.354 --> 02:51:37.981]  First on Ukraine, one of the things that many people recognize about you was that you, during the revolutions of 1989, funded a lot of dissident activities, civil society groups in Eastern Europe, in Poland, the Czech Republic.
[02:51:38.661 --> 02:51:40.462]  Are you doing similar things in Ukraine?
[02:51:40.902 --> 02:51:48.308]  Well, I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia.
[02:51:49.529 --> 02:51:53.252]  And the foundation has been functioning ever since.
[02:51:53.952 --> 02:51:57.555]  And it played an important part in events now.
[02:51:58.476 --> 02:51:59.397]  It would take hours.
[02:52:00.017 --> 02:52:14.023]  To chronicle the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that have been mysteriously murdered, gunned down, choked to death, drowned, cut into pieces since the Clintons were running for governor right through President, right through the State Department to today.
[02:52:14.943 --> 02:52:28.929]  But just since Bernie Sanders openly had the nomination stolen from him a few months ago, we've seen at least four top staffers over email, over servers, over all the key information being gunned down, being killed, being murdered.
[02:52:30.509 --> 02:52:39.099]  And WikiLeaks has come out and said, we don't reveal sources, but this is an alleged source, and we have put out a $20,000 reward.
[02:52:40.100 --> 02:52:43.304]  This is getting really, really out of control.
[02:52:43.324 --> 02:52:48.029]  The stuff that you're sitting on, is an October surprise in there?
[02:52:48.049 --> 02:52:51.253]  Do you even know what you're sitting on?
[02:52:52.150 --> 02:52:53.971]  WikiLeaks never sits on material.
[02:52:55.712 --> 02:53:01.074]  Our whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material, and often very significant risks.
[02:53:01.154 --> 02:53:11.118]  There's a 27-year-old that works for the DNC, who was shot in the back, murdered just two weeks ago, for unknown reasons, as he was walking down the street in Washington.
[02:53:11.578 --> 02:53:14.399]  So... That was just a robbery, I believe, wasn't it?
[02:53:15.220 --> 02:53:15.420]  No.
[02:53:15.780 --> 02:53:16.800]  There's no finding.
[02:53:17.100 --> 02:53:19.662]  So... What are you suggesting?
[02:53:22.697 --> 02:53:33.402]  I'm suggesting that our sources take risks and they become concerned to see things occurring like that.
[02:53:33.603 --> 02:53:35.103]  But was he one of your sources then?
[02:53:35.383 --> 02:53:38.405]  I mean... We don't comment on who our sources are.
[02:53:38.425 --> 02:53:42.807]  But why make the suggestion about a young guy being shot in the streets of Washington?
[02:53:43.367 --> 02:53:48.090]  Because we have to understand how high the stakes are.
[02:53:49.434 --> 02:53:53.877]  Google has been caught, so have Facebook, Twitter, you name it.
[02:53:54.557 --> 02:53:58.980]  Censoring anti-news stories about the Clintons, including the Clinton death count.
[02:53:59.620 --> 02:54:02.041]  We are seeing what the technocracy is able to do.
[02:54:02.081 --> 02:54:05.784]  We are seeing them openly engage in mass censorship.
[02:54:06.984 --> 02:54:09.546]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:54:10.646 --> 02:54:11.307]  In closing,
[02:54:13.322 --> 02:54:24.807]  I want to reach out to you with a personal appeal, a free human to other free humans of every race, color, and creed who have the spirit of liberty beating in your breast.
[02:54:26.728 --> 02:54:33.211]  I don't want to confront a kingpin that's killed millions of people around the world and who thinks it's funny.
[02:54:34.152 --> 02:54:35.712]  I don't want to take on this vampire.
[02:54:36.853 --> 02:54:39.014]  I don't want to fight this monster as an individual.
[02:54:40.267 --> 02:54:46.729]  But as a man, my spirit directs me, commands me to take action.
[02:54:47.810 --> 02:54:49.730]  I don't have any other choice.
[02:54:50.410 --> 02:54:53.531]  And I want to be victorious and successful in this quest.
[02:54:55.472 --> 02:55:03.155]  Evil historically takes over and is unstoppable as long as good men and women do nothing.
[02:55:03.975 --> 02:55:06.876]  But as Thomas Jefferson famously said, our third president,
[02:55:07.898 --> 02:55:10.940]  When we take action, nothing on Earth can stop us.
[02:55:11.941 --> 02:55:17.866]  That's why tyrants are so scared of good men and women who actually have goodwill and want you to have free will.
[02:55:18.787 --> 02:55:21.889]  And who want universal law to reign on this planet.
[02:55:23.391 --> 02:55:24.652]  We're facing cancer.
[02:55:25.372 --> 02:55:26.793]  That's what Hillary Clinton represents.
[02:55:27.394 --> 02:55:27.634]  Evil.
[02:55:28.835 --> 02:55:30.036]  She represents chaos.
[02:55:30.776 --> 02:55:32.318]  She represents lawlessness.
[02:55:32.998 --> 02:55:35.060]  She represents disease and failure.
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:37.262]  Her physical manifestation
[02:55:38.447 --> 02:55:41.308]  Is a rotting, reanimated corpse.
[02:55:42.689 --> 02:55:44.070]  I'm not scared of Hillary Clinton.
[02:55:45.130 --> 02:55:47.151]  But I am scared of failing in this mission.
[02:55:48.332 --> 02:55:52.593]  So I ask you all to redouble your efforts to expose the new world order.
[02:55:53.274 --> 02:55:54.654]  And I ask you all for your prayers.
[02:55:55.875 --> 02:55:57.616]  And I reach out to Hillary Clinton as well.
[02:55:58.336 --> 02:56:00.457]  Because I don't even personally hate her.
[02:56:01.237 --> 02:56:06.580]  I hate the spirit that has taken over her body, her mind, and her soul.
[02:56:08.063 --> 02:56:09.964]  There's still time for you to turn back, Hillary.
[02:56:11.025 --> 02:56:15.528]  You talk about my dark heart and then misrepresent what I've said.
[02:56:15.548 --> 02:56:19.411]  I have a heart of incredible love.
[02:56:20.312 --> 02:56:21.633]  I care deeply for people.
[02:56:22.333 --> 02:56:24.875]  And I even care for what's left of you.
[02:56:27.217 --> 02:56:34.282]  You wouldn't have said the things you said on that podium unless there wasn't some shred of humanity left in you.
[02:56:35.794 --> 02:56:38.797]  There's still time for you and others to turn back.
[02:56:40.599 --> 02:56:41.660]  But I want to be very, very clear.
[02:56:41.680 --> 02:56:49.127]  I have chosen the path I'm on, and I am willfully challenging you and everything that you represent.
[02:56:50.568 --> 02:56:58.897]  And I'm asking the population of this planet and those that love liberty to support us and to pray for us.
[02:57:00.171 --> 02:57:11.113]  And I'm telling you and your masters that I'm only one symbol of freedom, one manifestation, and that nothing on earth will stop the movement that you now see.
[02:57:12.493 --> 02:57:14.574]  It's time for Hillary Clinton to repent.
[02:57:15.434 --> 02:57:24.875]  It's time for Hillary Clinton to stop the murder, to stop the killing, to stop licking her lips like Madeleine Albright and herself when they talk about all the dead kids.
[02:57:25.915 --> 02:57:28.296]  I look at how you put in jihadis and al-Qaeda.
[02:57:29.295 --> 02:57:39.118]  Into Libya and into Syria to kill hundreds of thousands of Christians, and Obama won't let the Christians get out, but lets the Sunnis that engaged in the crime escape.
[02:57:41.478 --> 02:57:43.979]  And I just thank God I'm not on your team.
[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:48.420]  So whatever you do to me, that's between you and God.
[02:57:49.741 --> 02:57:52.362]  But I've made my choice, and I am not with you.
[02:57:53.982 --> 02:57:57.103]  I will never commit suicide, and if I am killed,
[02:57:58.393 --> 02:58:03.355]  The criminals that represent Hillary Rodham Clinton are the main suspects.
[02:58:04.836 --> 02:58:12.139]  You may have the old, rotten, discredited mainstream media that the AP says has a 6% trust rate with the public backing you, Hillary.
[02:58:13.300 --> 02:58:16.981]  But I've got common sense and the will of the people behind me.
[02:58:18.122 --> 02:58:19.322]  And I'm committed to a cause.
[02:58:20.543 --> 02:58:26.025]  And in history, and in this universe, nothing on earth can stand up against that.
[02:58:26.525 --> 02:58:27.846]  No matter what happens to this body,
[02:58:29.503 --> 02:58:35.366]  Ideas and movements backed by truth and liberty are invincible.
[02:58:36.186 --> 02:58:38.167]  They are bulletproof.
[02:58:40.668 --> 02:58:42.909]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:58:44.910 --> 02:58:46.171]  Very important broadcast.
[02:58:46.191 --> 02:58:47.712]  Videos on Infowars.com.
[02:58:47.752 --> 02:58:48.772]  Please spread it with the four winds.
[02:58:49.092 --> 02:58:51.954]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with a few calls from Preston, James and others.
[02:58:51.974 --> 02:58:52.034]  GCN.
[02:58:52.334 --> 02:58:55.635]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:55.676 --> 02:58:57.356]  Fourth hour, straight ahead.
[02:58:57.576 --> 02:58:58.417]  Fourth hour, straight ahead.
[02:59:00.960 --> 02:59:05.143]  The Huffington Post banned a journalist from writing about Hillary's health and even deleted his article.
[02:59:05.343 --> 02:59:10.067]  Journalist David Seaman pinned a commentary piece discussing questions surrounding Hillary's health on Sunday.
[02:59:10.187 --> 02:59:15.872]  The story even included a link to a viral InfoWars video about the subject, which has over 3.5 million views.
[02:59:16.212 --> 02:59:22.798]  And as reported by Politico's Watson, the article was trending, yet the Huffington Post still deleted it within hours and even revoked Seaman's posting rights.
[02:59:22.978 --> 02:59:28.201]  The article now just contains an editor's note stating this post is no longer available on the Huffington Post.
[02:59:28.401 --> 02:59:34.845]  And it's worth pointing out that the Huffington Post deleted the article despite the fact the site featured articles questioning John McCain's health in 2008.
[02:59:35.225 --> 02:59:42.389]  It appears the reason why the article disappeared was the fact that Seaman didn't automatically dismiss questions surrounding Hillary's health as a conspiracy theory.
[02:59:42.509 --> 02:59:47.812]  In response to the article's deletion, the journalist described the censorship as chilling and Orwellian.
[02:59:48.032 --> 02:59:51.654]  Seaman said, quote, both of my articles have been pulled without notice of any kind.
[02:59:51.874 --> 02:59:53.777]  Just completely deleted from the internet.
[02:59:53.897 --> 02:59:55.941]  And both of those articles mentioned Hillary's health.
[02:59:56.141 --> 02:59:58.825]  To find out more, visit Infowars.com.
[02:59:58.946 --> 03:00:00.228]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:00:02.772 --> 03:00:05.436]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:16.206 --> 03:00:20.087]  The answer to 1984 is human resistance to tyranny.
[03:00:20.827 --> 03:00:22.228]  Rediscovering answer.
[03:00:22.308 --> 03:00:23.268]  Freedom 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:23.508 --> 03:00:30.610]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:30.690 --> 03:00:31.991]  I tell you, I wouldn't have it any other way.
[03:00:32.051 --> 03:00:35.192]  Reality is so exhilarating, amazing, overwhelming.
[03:00:37.172 --> 03:00:40.793]  Thank God we're not with those timid souls that crouch down and lick the hands that feed them.
[03:00:40.833 --> 03:00:43.634]  May their chains set lightly upon them.
[03:00:43.674 --> 03:00:45.375]  But as for us, that is not our
[03:00:46.494 --> 03:00:49.195]  Fate, to paraphrase Patrick Henry.
[03:00:52.337 --> 03:00:55.439]  Now, I want to hand the baton to David Nye.
[03:00:55.459 --> 03:00:56.339]  Come on here in about six minutes.
[03:00:56.359 --> 03:00:59.601]  Let's go to Preston and James, who held like real troopers.
[03:01:00.081 --> 03:01:03.443]  Preston wants to talk from Minnesota about UN takeover of the net, which is official.
[03:01:04.043 --> 03:01:05.004]  Told people about it years ago.
[03:01:05.024 --> 03:01:06.044]  It was like, oh, it'll never happen.
[03:01:06.084 --> 03:01:08.105]  Now they're like, oh, we have the FOIA documents.
[03:01:08.125 --> 03:01:09.246]  Yeah, the UN's going to run it.
[03:01:09.306 --> 03:01:12.027]  And George Soros will be in control of that.
[03:01:12.588 --> 03:01:13.949]  James in Alabama and others.
[03:01:13.989 --> 03:01:14.609]  Go ahead, Preston.
[03:01:16.516 --> 03:01:16.756]  Alex?
[03:01:17.196 --> 03:01:17.516]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:17.877 --> 03:01:18.337]  Hi, Alex.
[03:01:18.637 --> 03:01:19.237]  Can you hear me?
[03:01:19.357 --> 03:01:22.039]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:22.119 --> 03:01:23.599]  First of all, thank you for what you're doing for us.
[03:01:23.719 --> 03:01:24.920]  Thank you, brother.
[03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:25.640]  It's amazing.
[03:01:25.660 --> 03:01:36.285]  But second of all, I want to ask you, see, if come October 1st, say, this operation isn't here or a drug report isn't here because of the UN takeover of the internet,
[03:01:36.894 --> 03:01:39.117]  Who are we supposed to listen to?
[03:01:39.157 --> 03:01:39.877]  It's beyond that.
[03:01:40.478 --> 03:01:49.908]  They're just starting regulations and court cases and suing people and attorney generals, indicting folks for having grand juries do it, saying man-made global warming isn't right.
[03:01:50.249 --> 03:01:51.170]  It'll be like 1937 Germany.
[03:01:54.073 --> 03:02:00.114]  It took five, six years to really get going and then the gloves are off and it just goes into... They'll never call it censorship.
[03:02:00.354 --> 03:02:08.356]  In their emails they do, but internet IDs, regulations, control, it's kind of like they're going to bring driverless cars in and then phase us out, they admit, with insurance costs.
[03:02:08.376 --> 03:02:10.376]  I mean, I read that 20 years ago.
[03:02:10.436 --> 03:02:11.156]  Now they're starting it.
[03:02:12.377 --> 03:02:13.257]  It's always incremental.
[03:02:13.277 --> 03:02:17.758]  They never want to give us a chance to struggle or actually have victories, so they do it by stealth.
[03:02:19.039 --> 03:02:19.179]  Thanks.
[03:02:35.319 --> 03:02:35.819]  Thank you, brother.
[03:02:35.839 --> 03:02:53.288]  I mean, what it is, is you have the Internet Registration Domain Name, which then controls the DNS and how the Internet basically operates and who can have what and who can have a piece of the web on their own, who isn't part of a big combine, an Internet ghetto, as Drudge says, like Facebook, Twitter, Google.
[03:02:54.289 --> 03:02:58.471]  And then they have Internet ID that's going to be a thumbprint on the keyboard or your phone.
[03:02:59.810 --> 03:03:02.091]  And they talked about that again 20 years ago when I was first getting on air.
[03:03:02.131 --> 03:03:04.032]  They said you'll have to thumbprint to get on the internet.
[03:03:04.052 --> 03:03:04.933]  People are like, oh, that's crazy.
[03:03:04.953 --> 03:03:05.853]  Well, now look at the iPhones.
[03:03:06.493 --> 03:03:06.994]  This is here.
[03:03:07.014 --> 03:03:07.654]  This is happening.
[03:03:08.034 --> 03:03:09.315]  James in Alabama, you're on the air.
[03:03:09.335 --> 03:03:10.496]  You want to talk about TPP?
[03:03:12.397 --> 03:03:12.857]  Yes, sir.
[03:03:12.917 --> 03:03:13.617]  That's correct.
[03:03:13.877 --> 03:03:16.138]  Um, just want to say I'm a first time caller.
[03:03:16.158 --> 03:03:18.019]  I've been listed for about three years.
[03:03:18.139 --> 03:03:19.380]  I just love what you're doing.
[03:03:19.500 --> 03:03:20.721]  I'm getting your information.
[03:03:20.801 --> 03:03:22.042]  All of it's been proven.
[03:03:22.062 --> 03:03:23.582]  You've been proven to be vindicated.
[03:03:24.103 --> 03:03:24.703]  But, um,
[03:03:25.279 --> 03:03:28.522]  With the TPP, I've done a lot of research recently about it.
[03:03:28.902 --> 03:03:41.032]  I mean, doesn't that kind of call it, like, tie into what your last caller was talking about with the internet control, and that if Hillary gets in, she's definitely going to approve it, and that literally gives power over to the multinational corporations?
[03:03:41.112 --> 03:03:42.433]  Oh, it legalizes slavery?
[03:03:42.473 --> 03:03:47.377]  We finally got it, thousands of pages after they ratified it and now claim it's law globally.
[03:03:47.417 --> 03:03:48.998]  Congress says they're going to pretty much pass it.
[03:03:50.099 --> 03:03:52.341]  And it just absolutely is worse than we even thought.
[03:03:52.361 --> 03:03:53.161]  It's totally insane.
[03:03:53.482 --> 03:03:54.623]  Legalizes slavery.
[03:03:55.655 --> 03:04:00.217]  Actually says you can have people chained up as slaves in factories and not let them go.
[03:04:01.898 --> 03:04:07.560]  You could maybe, maybe in the next couple weeks or something, just do like a show about the TPP.
[03:04:07.600 --> 03:04:08.080]  You bet.
[03:04:08.100 --> 03:04:10.021]  We should go over the worst elements of the TPP.
[03:04:10.101 --> 03:04:17.864]  I mean, there's 30 something sections and I mean, it's I mean, I've read I've read as WikiLeaks was dibbling them out.
[03:04:18.024 --> 03:04:20.105]  I read the sections once it kind of all came out.
[03:04:20.145 --> 03:04:22.546]  That was like more than 20 sections I hadn't read.
[03:04:22.626 --> 03:04:23.706]  It's just vomitous to read.
[03:04:23.726 --> 03:04:24.947]  But yeah, we should do a report on that.
[03:04:26.471 --> 03:04:26.971]  All right, man.
[03:04:26.991 --> 03:04:34.617]  Well, I appreciate it, and you are the tip of the spear, and I listen to you all the time, man, and I'm gonna keep spreading the word and buying the products, and you are truly awesome.
[03:04:34.637 --> 03:04:35.518]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[03:04:35.538 --> 03:04:42.683]  You are funding our operation, and so you're just as important as I am or David or anybody, but we're gonna go to break, come back, and get some final comments from myself, then hand the baton to David, but...
[03:04:43.624 --> 03:04:49.326]  Man, 20-something years ago, I'd go to the library and find a David Rockefeller quote about world government and how Mao Zedong was great.
[03:04:49.346 --> 03:04:51.866]  I'd run down to the TV station and show everybody, look, here's the proof.
[03:04:52.887 --> 03:04:58.828]  Now, it's like you read TPP and it's like every paragraph's total proof and then no one, it's not that people even care.
[03:04:58.848 --> 03:04:59.608]  It's like, what do you do?
[03:04:59.668 --> 03:05:09.091]  It's like stacks and stacks of proof and it's total tyranny and censorship and evil and they're going to break our families up and they're going to forcibly inoculate us and it's just horrible.
[03:05:12.871 --> 03:05:16.013]  You said in a speech today you're afraid this election is going to be rigged.
[03:05:16.373 --> 03:05:21.055]  I've been hearing about it for a long time and I hope the Republicans get out there and watch very closely.
[03:05:21.075 --> 03:05:23.736]  This new poll is showing a big convention balance for Hillary Clinton.
[03:05:23.856 --> 03:05:27.858]  Following her nomination at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton now leads it.
[03:05:28.178 --> 03:05:29.779]  Donald Trump, 50% to 42%.
[03:05:30.199 --> 03:05:32.901]  That's a seven point jump from last week.
[03:05:33.021 --> 03:05:35.462]  You see, he's supposed to just sit there and let them steal it.
[03:05:35.642 --> 03:05:37.203]  But he didn't sit there, so they failed.
[03:05:38.860 --> 03:05:45.866]  And they think they're gonna have another stolen general election in front of everybody at high noon, and we're just gonna sit here and go along with it.
[03:05:46.026 --> 03:05:46.367]  We're not.
[03:05:47.423 --> 03:05:48.144]  I'm gonna fight it.
[03:05:48.384 --> 03:05:49.244]  Trump's gonna fight it.
[03:05:49.485 --> 03:05:50.205]  You're gonna fight it.
[03:05:50.345 --> 03:05:52.407]  Bob Mulholland from Chico, California.
[03:05:52.427 --> 03:05:55.869]  I'm a DNC member, thus a superdelegate to the National Convention.
[03:05:55.889 --> 03:05:56.650]  First of all, it's rigged.
[03:05:57.250 --> 03:05:59.712]  And I'm afraid the election's gonna be rigged, I have to be honest.
[03:06:00.373 --> 03:06:05.256]  And the way we work is that anybody who gets 15% more in an election gets delegates.
[03:06:05.396 --> 03:06:07.398]  So this election will go all the way to California.
[03:06:07.738 --> 03:06:11.461]  Sanders will end up with well over a thousand delegates and Hillary will get the nomination.
[03:06:11.701 --> 03:06:20.385]  Hillary Clinton has had every advantage, every break given to her from the very beginning by this Democratic Party.
[03:06:20.505 --> 03:06:21.466]  It has been rigged.
[03:06:21.586 --> 03:06:33.312]  It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and largely to
[03:06:33.932 --> 03:06:35.835]  Facilitate that outcome, they are being done.
[03:06:35.975 --> 03:06:44.226]  If Hillary steals the nomination, and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with Trump, you have to say it must be thrown out.
[03:06:44.626 --> 03:06:47.450]  The political parties choose their nominee, not the general public.
[03:06:48.371 --> 03:06:49.813]  Contrary to popular belief.
[03:06:50.234 --> 03:06:51.776]  Then why are they holding the primaries?
[03:06:52.774 --> 03:06:53.975]  That's a very good question.
[03:06:54.015 --> 03:06:57.860]  WikiLeaks has dumped nearly 20,000 hacked emails from the DNC.
[03:06:57.880 --> 03:07:05.107]  We're talking about the report of leaked DNC emails showing an effort to undermine Bernie Sanders during the primaries.
[03:07:05.428 --> 03:07:09.793]  The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.
[03:07:10.513 --> 03:07:15.457]  When did the press see it as their role to protect the prerogative of the powerful?
[03:07:15.518 --> 03:07:16.538]  Actually, I think that's part of it.
[03:07:16.759 --> 03:07:20.482]  And we're not going to recognize Queen Hillary if there's evidence of fraud.
[03:07:20.782 --> 03:07:21.663]  And guess what there is?
[03:07:21.923 --> 03:07:23.825]  She stole the nomination.
[03:07:24.125 --> 03:07:26.847]  I want to thank Bernie Sanders.
[03:07:27.848 --> 03:07:32.712]  If he would have just not done anything, just go home, go to sleep, relax, he would have been a hero.
[03:07:32.852 --> 03:07:34.434]  But he made a deal with the devil.
[03:07:34.454 --> 03:07:34.814]  She's the devil.
[03:07:34.854 --> 03:07:36.576]  He made a deal with the devil.
[03:07:38.138 --> 03:07:42.621]  The media has created the perception that the voters will decide the nomination, and that's the concept.
[03:07:42.661 --> 03:07:44.022]  That's the conflict here.
[03:07:44.042 --> 03:07:46.003]  We feel like we live in a democratic society.
[03:07:46.043 --> 03:07:51.327]  What you're telling me is it's not a democratic society and your votes don't necessarily matter because it's a democratic representation.
[03:07:51.407 --> 03:07:53.688]  Crooked Hillary thinks they're gonna pull the lid on Mitt Romney?
[03:07:54.149 --> 03:07:54.669]  Mm, lady.
[03:07:54.689 --> 03:07:55.830]  It ain't gonna happen.
[03:07:56.030 --> 03:08:01.153]  That's why her campaign head, her chief strategist said, this is dangerous what Trump's doing.
[03:08:01.534 --> 03:08:02.955]  You're right, it is dangerous, isn't it?
[03:08:03.595 --> 03:08:04.896]  Actually standing up to you.
[03:08:05.156 --> 03:08:07.758]  There has to come a point at which you say, enough.
[03:08:11.461 --> 03:08:13.663]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[03:08:14.423 --> 03:08:15.825]  Because it leads to the future.
[03:08:16.585 --> 03:08:18.887]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[03:08:20.028 --> 03:08:21.029]  This is not a new world.
[03:08:22.276 --> 03:08:25.439]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[03:08:25.459 --> 03:08:34.166]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[03:08:35.106 --> 03:08:42.012]  It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[03:08:43.153 --> 03:08:48.237]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[03:08:48.877 --> 03:08:50.979]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[03:08:50.999 --> 03:08:53.681]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:08:53.961 --> 03:09:01.828]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:10.802 --> 03:09:14.923]  You know, I've studied the United Nations, I've studied the OECD that set it up.
[03:09:17.403 --> 03:09:23.665]  That was a private banking consortium headed up by the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the House of Windsor, and the, I guess, the House of Orange?
[03:09:23.685 --> 03:09:25.365]  That's the Dutch royalty, it's cousins.
[03:09:26.805 --> 03:09:33.267]  And, uh, when they took Europe over during its reconstruction, they just basically run the place, just like Japan since then.
[03:09:34.787 --> 03:09:39.028]  And so when I read the Wall Street Journal or Daily Caller, who are doing great jobs reporting on this,
[03:09:41.351 --> 03:09:42.612]  I see what's hiding in plain view.
[03:09:43.653 --> 03:09:45.034]  An internet giveaway to the U.N.
[03:09:45.755 --> 03:09:46.335]  If the U.S.
[03:09:46.596 --> 03:09:49.118]  advocates internet stewardship, the United Nations might take control.
[03:09:49.238 --> 03:09:50.319]  It might take control?
[03:09:51.059 --> 03:09:54.802]  When the Obama administration announced... See, because it would sound too conspiratorial to say it is, even though it is.
[03:09:54.823 --> 03:10:02.429]  Because, see, they pre-inoculate you that this wasn't happening all the years, so it's like going out on a limb to even admit it could happen, as it is happening.
[03:10:03.290 --> 03:10:05.532]  When the Obama administration announced its plan to give up U.S.
[03:10:05.972 --> 03:10:06.853]  protection of the internet,
[03:10:08.007 --> 03:10:09.708]  It promised the United Nations would never take control.
[03:10:10.229 --> 03:10:18.455]  Because of the administration's naivete, oh I'm sure, or arrogance, or how about criminal intent, U.N.
[03:10:18.516 --> 03:10:20.717]  control is a likely result if the U.S.
[03:10:20.757 --> 03:10:24.540]  gives up internet stewardship as planned at midnight on September 30th.
[03:10:27.163 --> 03:10:29.364]  We're talking a month out now.
[03:10:29.564 --> 03:10:30.265]  Oh my gosh.
[03:10:31.266 --> 03:10:32.227]  How many days to the election?
[03:10:34.048 --> 03:10:37.351]  How many da- 70 days to the election.
[03:10:39.956 --> 03:10:45.242]  T-minus 31 days until the Internet is taken.
[03:10:45.262 --> 03:10:45.803]  Of course, they'll go.
[03:10:46.103 --> 03:10:54.092]  They'll be on CNN going, the UN was supposed to take over, but it's October 1st and the Internet's still there.
[03:10:54.152 --> 03:10:55.033]  There's no censorship.
[03:10:55.213 --> 03:10:58.617]  I just have stacks every day as they just warm up the testing.
[03:10:59.278 --> 03:10:59.778]  All over the world.
[03:11:00.039 --> 03:11:02.140]  Arrest people in Germany and France and Sweden.
[03:11:03.241 --> 03:11:09.625]  Hire former Stasi brigade commanders to run Facebook, taggling to the police.
[03:11:10.225 --> 03:11:11.566]  Zuckerberg meets with Merkel.
[03:11:11.866 --> 03:11:14.348]  Oh, don't worry, we'll crack down soon, my darling.
[03:11:15.789 --> 03:11:16.650]  You read this article.
[03:11:16.670 --> 03:11:19.452]  Of course, I know about the ICAN agreement, the UN agreement.
[03:11:19.492 --> 03:11:21.173]  I remember 10 years ago when they started this program.
[03:11:21.193 --> 03:11:22.053]  The agreement's already been made.
[03:11:22.093 --> 03:11:22.874]  Now, let's expand.
[03:11:24.892 --> 03:11:26.152]  Daily Caller gets it right.
[03:11:26.893 --> 03:11:28.893]  They're the ones digging through the thousands of Soros emails.
[03:11:29.513 --> 03:11:30.654]  Thanks to DC Leaks.
[03:11:32.234 --> 03:11:32.994]  Which just got censored.
[03:11:33.715 --> 03:11:34.615]  Soros document.
[03:11:34.695 --> 03:11:37.356]  Regulate internet to favor open society supporters.
[03:11:38.576 --> 03:11:39.356]  I want you to read it.
[03:11:39.436 --> 03:11:41.297]  He says the UN's gonna run it.
[03:11:42.273 --> 03:11:51.342]  And that NGOs, like Open Society, signed up with the UN to get preferential treatment, placement, and pushing, and that extremism should be filtered out.
[03:11:51.662 --> 03:11:53.444]  Which they're already doing, extremism.
[03:11:54.105 --> 03:12:04.795]  Alexa, two years ago, took tens of thousands of libertarian, patriotic, conservative, veterans rights groups, gun groups, anything that was just not total communist, you know, run by a Nazi collaborator, crazy.
[03:12:04.815 --> 03:12:06.356]  I mean, that's what it is.
[03:12:07.236 --> 03:12:10.798]  Anything not Open Society just went 80% drop in as opposed to the traffic we have.
[03:12:11.118 --> 03:12:12.579]  Our traffic's only going straight up.
[03:12:12.859 --> 03:12:14.059]  They just say we don't even exist!
[03:12:16.060 --> 03:12:17.041]  It's everywhere.
[03:12:17.061 --> 03:12:20.262]  Dr. Drew's fired in less than a week for saying Hillary looks really sick.
[03:12:21.303 --> 03:12:22.023]  I've looked at her record.
[03:12:22.063 --> 03:12:23.724]  Just the drugs she's on would kill anybody.
[03:12:29.006 --> 03:12:29.606]  And here they are.
[03:12:29.647 --> 03:12:36.770]  But see, this should say UN Takeover because it's NGOs regulated by the Internet.
[03:12:37.728 --> 03:12:40.050]  And then TPP only expands the authorization of this.
[03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:44.633]  And of course they do have a related UN Internet agenda tied to George Soros.
[03:12:44.913 --> 03:12:46.034]  So they do get it.
[03:12:46.074 --> 03:12:48.876]  It's just that the headline should be even more hardcore.
[03:12:50.617 --> 03:12:51.238]  We should do a story.
[03:12:51.278 --> 03:12:55.340]  How the UN takeover of the web is now commencing with George Soros at its head.
[03:12:57.622 --> 03:12:59.704]  And so Hillary comes out two weeks ago in an email.
[03:13:00.825 --> 03:13:02.307]  Raising money from Hillary Clinton.
[03:13:02.347 --> 03:13:03.128]  We showed the articles.
[03:13:03.188 --> 03:13:04.309]  It's been mainstream news.
[03:13:04.710 --> 03:13:09.195]  And says we're not going to tolerate the alt-right.
[03:13:09.275 --> 03:13:10.056]  And who is the alt-right?
[03:13:10.116 --> 03:13:10.617]  Breitbart.
[03:13:10.757 --> 03:13:13.220]  Lead elephant heading up the Trump campaign.
[03:13:14.361 --> 03:13:15.382]  Then she goes and gives a speech.
[03:13:15.523 --> 03:13:17.405]  Goes after Breitbart.
[03:13:19.127 --> 03:13:23.030]  Goes after people they know aren't ubiquitous as Drudge.
[03:13:23.370 --> 03:13:24.151]  People like Drudge.
[03:13:24.191 --> 03:13:25.131]  Even liberals like Drudge.
[03:13:25.151 --> 03:13:26.492]  Drudge is like the biggest newspaper out there.
[03:13:26.512 --> 03:13:28.274]  So, we're not going to get rid of Drudge.
[03:13:28.294 --> 03:13:29.274]  Of course, that's their main target.
[03:13:29.435 --> 03:13:32.697]  Because people know that sounds kind of like a little too loved.
[03:13:33.157 --> 03:13:33.778]  Too well-known.
[03:13:34.678 --> 03:13:35.819]  Let's go after Alex Jones.
[03:13:35.859 --> 03:13:36.900]  Let's go after Breitbart.
[03:13:36.920 --> 03:13:39.482]  Let's go after... And then misconstrue what we say.
[03:13:39.742 --> 03:13:41.443]  Say Bannon's this big racist, you know.
[03:13:41.463 --> 03:13:43.065]  And now, of course, Trump's KKK.
[03:13:43.585 --> 03:13:47.388]  This is the desperateness, but it shows they're really moving into this phase.
[03:13:50.762 --> 03:13:52.503]  David Knight, what do you make of all of this?
[03:13:52.523 --> 03:13:55.425]  Do you concur, or what would you add as I hand the baton to you?
[03:13:55.485 --> 03:13:58.706]  I mean... Well, yeah, Alex, you know, we talk about the alt-right.
[03:13:59.007 --> 03:13:59.787]  Who is the alt-right?
[03:14:00.007 --> 03:14:01.928]  It's whoever Hillary Clinton says it is.
[03:14:01.988 --> 03:14:06.251]  They define the terms, and then they ban the people that they put into those categories.
[03:14:06.691 --> 03:14:09.552]  And we talk about what's going on with the TPP and the TTIP.
[03:14:10.453 --> 03:14:17.057]  The worst part about it, I mean, there's a lot of specifics we could talk about, and it is a huge document, but here's the only thing that you really need to know.
[03:14:17.857 --> 03:14:27.624]  Senator Sessions, who did look at this in detail, who is an experienced lawyer, and he prepared a presentation for his fellow members in the Senate who could care less.
[03:14:28.344 --> 03:14:30.266]  They didn't bother to even look at the document.
[03:14:30.286 --> 03:14:31.667]  They didn't listen to his preparation.
[03:14:31.687 --> 03:14:33.268]  But here's the key point, Alex.
[03:14:33.888 --> 03:14:38.411]  The TPP, the TTIP, are living documents.
[03:14:38.932 --> 03:14:39.652]  Now what does that mean?
[03:14:39.692 --> 03:14:41.433]  That means that no matter what these 6,000 pages say,
[03:14:42.594 --> 03:14:43.895]  Means they're open-ended power grabs.
[03:14:43.995 --> 03:14:44.475]  Exactly.
[03:14:44.615 --> 03:14:51.780]  Tomorrow, the small committee of unelected, unaccountable people that's going to be not necessarily even in the American economy.
[03:14:51.800 --> 03:15:00.026]  Just like Obamacare is a committee, and now they're saying, oh guess what, insurance companies are going to quadruple charge and create monopolies and not allow competition in your state!
[03:15:00.466 --> 03:15:02.828]  Oh, in fact, 16 states don't even have competition now!
[03:15:02.928 --> 03:15:04.369]  Oh, it's going to help the consumer!
[03:15:04.549 --> 03:15:05.310]  Oh, it's so liberal!
[03:15:05.530 --> 03:15:06.711]  I'm sorry, David, you're absolutely right.
[03:15:07.071 --> 03:15:18.115]  Yeah, well, that's one aspect of it, is that they can change anything that they want to, at will, without ever going back and getting any further approval from any of the governments that give them a rubber stamp.
[03:15:18.355 --> 03:15:19.455]  And here's the other thing, Alex.
[03:15:19.576 --> 03:15:26.318]  Part two of that is that they can include and add any nation that they wish to that, which is the way it's being sold to us.
[03:15:26.358 --> 03:15:30.419]  TPP is being sold to us as a means of checking China.
[03:15:31.140 --> 03:15:34.201]  China is not part of the TPP right now, and Trump got
[03:15:35.161 --> 03:15:35.542]  We're good.
[03:15:54.378 --> 03:16:02.842]  To a small committee of unelected people who are going to control it just as you had the European Commission controlling the fishing rights off of British waters.
[03:16:02.882 --> 03:16:03.282]  Absolutely.
[03:16:03.302 --> 03:16:05.963]  Here's my question for you and then I'm going to hand the baton to you, David.
[03:16:06.583 --> 03:16:11.105]  What do you make of the massive intensification of censorship globally, not just here?
[03:16:11.125 --> 03:16:12.906]  Is this a test to see what we'll do?
[03:16:12.946 --> 03:16:14.207]  There should be congressional hearings.
[03:16:14.587 --> 03:16:16.728]  There should be massive uproar over this.
[03:16:17.697 --> 03:16:28.321]  Well, Alex, as you know, the only, the most important thing that we've got going, it's not the only thing we've got going, the most important thing we've got going is our ability to share information and to expose what they're doing.
[03:16:28.521 --> 03:16:30.741]  Hillary talks about the dark corners of the net.
[03:16:30.781 --> 03:16:38.484]  No, the net is there to expose light on her dark transactions as she does everything, breaks every law to try to hide.
[03:16:38.964 --> 03:16:41.185]  And so they have to get control of the internet.
[03:16:41.625 --> 03:16:43.247]  It is truly the high ground.
[03:16:43.527 --> 03:16:46.749]  Political speech is the high ground in politics.
[03:16:47.130 --> 03:16:57.458]  If you can control the narrative, if you can tell people what's going on without any competition, you create the reality in their minds and you can hide anything that you want without criticism.
[03:16:57.478 --> 03:16:58.339]  We're seeing that right now.
[03:16:58.379 --> 03:17:02.723]  We're seeing the establishment press, we're seeing the establishment political parties of both sides.
[03:17:02.883 --> 03:17:06.466]  And more and more they're saying arrest climate deniers, arrest arrests in the family.
[03:17:07.006 --> 03:17:10.008]  I mean, I think they're really trying to normalize their agenda because it's in trouble.
[03:17:10.408 --> 03:17:16.852]  I think we're beginning to see major cracks in their whole organization and agencies and patriots leaking more and more info.
[03:17:17.192 --> 03:17:18.353]  I think they've gone too far, David.
[03:17:18.373 --> 03:17:19.714]  I think they've proven our case for us.
[03:17:20.634 --> 03:17:28.799]  I think that they are on the wrong side of history and the fact that patriots for decades exposed their agenda, that it's now going to be dead on arrival.
[03:17:28.819 --> 03:17:29.739]  I'm going to hand the baton to you.
[03:17:29.759 --> 03:17:30.320]  Thank you, David Knight.
[03:17:31.104 --> 03:17:37.907]  Thank you Alex, and you know we can see that whenever we go to these rallies that they have just as we did with the abortionists.
[03:17:37.927 --> 03:17:38.647]  What do they want to do?
[03:17:39.167 --> 03:17:45.690]  They want to stand there with black signs that had absolutely nothing to say when we were protesting the abortion clinic here in Austin.
[03:17:45.730 --> 03:17:46.710]  They had nothing to say.
[03:17:46.750 --> 03:17:52.372]  They came up with black signs to try to redact publicly on the sidewalk what we were saying.
[03:17:52.852 --> 03:17:53.733]  They didn't want to counter it.
[03:17:53.993 --> 03:17:55.073]  They didn't want to argue with it.
[03:17:55.433 --> 03:17:59.295]  And we've seen this happen with the vaccination, with the film Vaxxed.
[03:17:59.935 --> 03:18:08.461]  With the Tribeca Film Festival, there was other filmmakers who actually came out and said, we want this film silenced.
[03:18:08.942 --> 03:18:09.742]  We want it censored.
[03:18:10.223 --> 03:18:14.646]  So now you have the press, especially those in the art community,
[03:18:15.086 --> 03:18:35.741]  Who have always held the First Amendment as a sacred, untouchable thing, and now they're going around at various film festivals, whether it's a film about vaccinations, Vaxxed, or whether it is the film, I just talked to Mark Hall about his film, looking at charter schools, and worst case examples of that, with the Vitala Gulen Network here getting a half a billion dollars per year.
[03:18:36.341 --> 03:18:38.401]  of taxpayer money to run schools.
[03:18:38.622 --> 03:18:41.982]  They've got a network of a thousand schools all over the world.
[03:18:42.042 --> 03:18:46.523]  The other schools outside of America, of course, are explicitly Islamic.
[03:18:47.083 --> 03:18:51.324]  And so we look at these various documentaries, like Mark Hall's documentary, Killing Ed.
[03:18:51.784 --> 03:18:53.745]  They want to keep it out of the film festivals.
[03:18:54.085 --> 03:18:59.486]  They don't want to have a discussion, whether it's climate change, whether it's vaccinations.
[03:19:00.646 --> 03:19:00.966]  You're right.
[03:19:01.146 --> 03:19:01.566]  Exactly.
[03:19:01.586 --> 03:19:02.787]  They don't want a discussion.
[03:19:02.827 --> 03:19:04.947]  They want to just simply silence you.
[03:19:05.667 --> 03:19:08.848]  And it couldn't be anything further from the truth than what we saw from Voltaire.
[03:19:08.868 --> 03:19:13.810]  He said, I may disagree with you, but I will defend to the death your right to say what you want to say.
[03:19:13.870 --> 03:19:15.350]  They don't want to have that discussion.
[03:19:15.370 --> 03:19:17.531]  They want to criminalize it, and they want to censor it.
[03:19:17.551 --> 03:19:18.491]  And we see that everywhere.
[03:19:18.951 --> 03:19:22.092]  It's one of the things that really concerns me when I look at Gary Johnson.
[03:19:22.132 --> 03:19:26.033]  I know that there was a back-and-forth when you were talking to Jesse Ventura.
[03:19:26.373 --> 03:19:29.114]  He's solidly behind Gary Johnson.
[03:19:29.754 --> 03:19:32.295]  I don't believe that Gary Johnson is even a libertarian.
[03:19:32.415 --> 03:19:35.056]  I don't think the Libertarian Party is libertarian anymore.
[03:19:35.076 --> 03:19:40.717]  And I say that as somebody who spent 20 years working with him, who was a lifetime member of the LP.
[03:19:41.037 --> 03:19:44.738]  And I'm absolutely disgusted with these people who have sold all their principles.
[03:19:44.758 --> 03:19:47.239]  Bob, the last few times he was here, Gary Johnson went from
[03:19:47.699 --> 03:19:49.180]  He looks like Emperor Palpatine in the eyes.
[03:19:49.620 --> 03:19:56.462]  He's got the little friendly guy act going on, but when you tell him he's a person, I'd talk to him and he'd be alright on air, but when I'd talk to him during the breaks, he'd be like, ehhh.
[03:19:56.482 --> 03:19:57.422]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:19:57.442 --> 03:19:59.903]  And it was just like, whoa, and I was like, I don't ever want him on again.
[03:20:00.363 --> 03:20:01.904]  Creepy, creepy, creepy.
[03:20:01.924 --> 03:20:03.504]  Alright, David, God bless you.
[03:20:03.524 --> 03:20:05.085]  Nightly News is tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:20:05.145 --> 03:20:05.985]  David Knight, straight ahead.
[03:20:10.971 --> 03:20:18.441]  In 1993, Hillary Clinton ordered Vince Foster's dead body to be moved and dumped to avoid a murder investigation.
[03:20:18.762 --> 03:20:22.286]  New York Times bestselling author Roger Stone names names.
[03:20:22.667 --> 03:20:25.410]  The Clintons War on Women in stores now.
[03:20:25.811 --> 03:20:31.895]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[03:20:32.275 --> 03:20:35.177]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[03:20:35.497 --> 03:20:40.701]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[03:20:41.121 --> 03:20:47.105]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[03:20:47.245 --> 03:20:50.367]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[03:20:50.527 --> 03:20:51.968]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[03:20:52.168 --> 03:20:56.312]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[03:20:56.512 --> 03:20:59.374]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[03:20:59.454 --> 03:21:01.016]  It works like an antioxidant.
[03:21:01.116 --> 03:21:04.299]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[03:21:04.579 --> 03:21:06.901]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[03:21:07.181 --> 03:21:08.142]  It's in powder form.
[03:21:08.242 --> 03:21:10.944]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[03:21:11.125 --> 03:21:11.725]  I take this.
[03:21:11.845 --> 03:21:13.527]  This is the product that I take.
[03:21:13.647 --> 03:21:15.629]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[03:21:16.429 --> 03:21:17.211]  We fight the Globals.
[03:21:17.231 --> 03:21:18.072]  We fight the New World Order.
[03:21:18.392 --> 03:21:24.281]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[03:21:24.501 --> 03:21:32.033]  Hey Chelsea, has your mother ever told you that you're the daughter of Webb Hubble and not Bill Clinton?
[03:21:40.626 --> 03:21:49.655]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:21:49.716 --> 03:21:57.824]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:21:58.124 --> 03:22:02.826]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:22:02.986 --> 03:22:09.688]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:22:09.788 --> 03:22:16.871]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:22:16.951 --> 03:22:23.813]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:22:23.993 --> 03:22:28.335]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:22:28.455 --> 03:22:31.717]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:22:31.857 --> 03:22:37.981]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:22:38.161 --> 03:22:40.382]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:22:40.662 --> 03:22:48.326]  As first lady and co-president, did Hillary Clinton order the Waco siege that left 18 children dead?
[03:22:49.347 --> 03:22:52.869]  Find out in The Clinton's War on Women.
[03:22:55.342 --> 03:22:59.726]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[03:22:59.826 --> 03:23:10.836]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extractors.
[03:23:10.916 --> 03:23:15.858]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[03:23:15.958 --> 03:23:18.479]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[03:23:18.539 --> 03:23:20.040]  It helps detoxify.
[03:23:20.260 --> 03:23:23.081]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[03:23:23.141 --> 03:23:27.883]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[03:23:27.903 --> 03:23:34.146]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[03:23:34.186 --> 03:23:39.489]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[03:23:39.509 --> 03:23:40.269]  I'm taking it now.
[03:23:40.469 --> 03:23:46.110]  Hillary Clinton has an unusually close relationship with top female aide, Huma Abedin.
[03:23:46.150 --> 03:23:47.951]  But does Huma have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood?
[03:23:47.971 --> 03:23:50.311]  Find out in The Clinton's War on Women, in stores now.
[03:24:21.746 --> 03:24:24.108]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show in this fourth hour.
[03:24:24.148 --> 03:24:25.669]  It's Monday, August 29th, 2016.
[03:24:26.169 --> 03:24:32.875]  Day number 269 with no press conferences from Hillary Clinton.
[03:24:33.495 --> 03:24:35.937]  Because you know, press conferences are like a box of chocolate.
[03:24:36.297 --> 03:24:37.678]  You never know what you're going to get.
[03:24:38.219 --> 03:24:39.400]  So run, Hillary, run!
[03:24:40.040 --> 03:24:41.381]  Run from the questions.
[03:24:41.461 --> 03:24:48.266]  Run from the people speaking out at multiple times or flashes that could trigger you into some kind of a issue.
[03:24:48.286 --> 03:24:49.867]  I don't know what's going to happen with the debates.
[03:24:49.887 --> 03:24:51.729]  It's going to be interesting to see what happens with the debates.
[03:24:52.209 --> 03:24:55.952]  Because that's not going to go according to script with Donald Trump there.
[03:24:55.992 --> 03:24:58.154]  So the debates are going to be very interesting when they happen.
[03:24:59.114 --> 03:25:02.917]  But the rest of the press ought to start hitting her on a daily basis.
[03:25:02.957 --> 03:25:10.281]  I tell you, every day that I come on, I'm going to give you a daily countdown on how many days it's been since Hillary faced open questions from the press.
[03:25:10.341 --> 03:25:11.042]  And they're afraid of her.
[03:25:11.062 --> 03:25:11.782]  They won't ask.
[03:25:12.403 --> 03:25:16.185]  Because they know that if they ask, they'll have their access cut off.
[03:25:16.645 --> 03:25:21.789]  I have to ask you, what does access mean if you can't ask questions?
[03:25:22.910 --> 03:25:24.090]  What good is access?
[03:25:24.130 --> 03:25:26.452]  Is it so you can do a selfie with Hillary Clinton?
[03:25:26.912 --> 03:25:33.035]  So that you look important asking her softball questions because you're sitting across the table from her or she's got a call-in.
[03:25:33.075 --> 03:25:36.577]  I mean she even, with Anderson Cooper, she even phoned it in.
[03:25:36.878 --> 03:25:38.218]  She did an on-the-phone interview.
[03:25:38.298 --> 03:25:43.661]  So, I don't know, I guess maybe that makes them look important that they have access to Hillary Clinton.
[03:25:43.801 --> 03:25:46.503]  I don't need access to Hillary Clinton to understand what she's about.
[03:25:46.963 --> 03:25:48.204]  To report on Hillary Clinton.
[03:25:48.824 --> 03:25:55.149]  And I don't actually need to ask her the questions, although it would be interesting to see her taking some questions from some InfoWars reporters.
[03:25:55.929 --> 03:25:56.970]  We're not going to see that, though.
[03:25:57.350 --> 03:25:59.252]  Okay, she's not going to take questions from anybody.
[03:25:59.292 --> 03:26:05.056]  Before I get back to the news, I want to remind you that we have a special 20% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:26:05.096 --> 03:26:09.819]  And this is the way I prefer to get my multivitamins and minerals.
[03:26:10.059 --> 03:26:11.741]  I don't like to take a lot of pills.
[03:26:12.521 --> 03:26:23.948]  And that's one of the things when you start trying to take your health seriously, you start looking at the things that you need to supplement that you're not getting in your daily diet, all of a sudden you start getting all these overlaps and you're taking a big wad of pills.
[03:26:24.048 --> 03:26:24.948]  I don't like to do that.
[03:26:25.408 --> 03:26:31.652]  I also don't trust that pills are going to be as bioavailable as something that I take in a liquid form.
[03:26:31.752 --> 03:26:36.514]  So I would prefer to put all this stuff in a liquid drink, and that's exactly what you get with Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:26:36.894 --> 03:26:40.835]  With one of these containers, a daily dose of this will last you for a month.
[03:26:41.075 --> 03:26:46.297]  And it's loaded with a full month of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body needs.
[03:26:46.637 --> 03:26:49.258]  You can take a look at our website at infowarslife.com.
[03:26:49.759 --> 03:26:51.179]  Take a look at what it has.
[03:26:51.199 --> 03:26:56.521]  It's a great tasting mix, and of course, if you want to, you can make it taste like anything you want.
[03:26:56.661 --> 03:27:04.432]  You can mix any kind of fruit or flavoring with these drinks and take your vitamins very easily without swallowing a lot of pills.
[03:27:04.472 --> 03:27:10.501]  Get all that in a bioavailable form and it is 20% off right now at InfoWarsLife.com
[03:27:11.974 --> 03:27:19.038]  You know, we were talking about Gary Johnson and the Libertarian Party, because Jesse Ventura was talking about that with Alex Jones.
[03:27:19.519 --> 03:27:27.944]  He went on Sunday, and in an interview with Chris Wallace, he said to him, he said, you know, this election cycle is so crazy, if I get into the debates, I might actually win.
[03:27:28.851 --> 03:27:30.192]  Could be, but I don't think so.
[03:27:30.552 --> 03:27:31.372]  I really don't think so.
[03:27:31.512 --> 03:27:42.137]  Once people understand where he's coming from, once they understand that the Libertarian Party is no longer the party of principle, it is another crony capitalist party.
[03:27:42.457 --> 03:27:47.620]  If you look at the policies that Gary Johnson and William Weld, two, I would say
[03:27:48.420 --> 03:27:48.781]  We're good.
[03:28:04.395 --> 03:28:10.399]  What he was running on, ignoring things like civil asset forfeiture and the real core issues of the war on drugs.
[03:28:10.559 --> 03:28:12.600]  He was pushing marijuana because he wanted to sell it.
[03:28:12.660 --> 03:28:15.802]  And he does sell marijuana, or did until he started running.
[03:28:15.842 --> 03:28:17.283]  He suspended that business.
[03:28:17.964 --> 03:28:23.467]  But the core issues, I felt, he was ignoring and just giving us a warmed-over version of what the Democrats are doing.
[03:28:23.527 --> 03:28:27.410]  Now he's actually become a stalking horse for Hillary Clinton.
[03:28:27.790 --> 03:28:29.051]  And if you think I'm being too rough on him,
[03:28:29.491 --> 03:28:41.903]  If you think I'm saying that he sold out his principles, I mean, go back and look at the Libertarian Party Convention when he was adamant that he had to have William Weld with him because William Weld had access to the money men in the Northeast.
[03:28:42.263 --> 03:28:47.188]  He had access to Mitt Romney, the two of them, friends from being governors in Massachusetts.
[03:28:47.948 --> 03:28:54.315]  And William Weld is the old money, the old Ivy League, the old skull-and-crossbone type of guy.
[03:28:54.335 --> 03:28:55.796]  I don't know that he was a skull-and-crossbone.
[03:28:55.836 --> 03:29:00.701]  He's the old Ivy League type of guy with all the connections to all the big money on Wall Street.
[03:29:00.741 --> 03:29:05.306]  And that's what we've seen from Gary Johnson, pandering to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:29:05.326 --> 03:29:06.066]  And let me say this.
[03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:11.868]  If you're going to have these so-called partnerships, you know, they used to call them free trade agreements.
[03:29:12.169 --> 03:29:13.351]  They were treaties, okay?
[03:29:13.391 --> 03:29:14.573]  They weren't about free trade.
[03:29:15.194 --> 03:29:17.578]  As Ron Paul used to say, the real libertarian would say,
[03:29:18.730 --> 03:29:22.532]  You don't need to have thousands of pages if you're going to have free trade.
[03:29:22.792 --> 03:29:23.653]  You say, hey, you know what?
[03:29:23.693 --> 03:29:25.754]  We're not going to tax stuff coming in and out of our countries.
[03:29:26.014 --> 03:29:27.435]  That's the agreement that you have.
[03:29:27.995 --> 03:29:31.117]  But if you have thousands of pages, you don't have free trade.
[03:29:31.617 --> 03:29:32.918]  You have managed trade.
[03:29:33.298 --> 03:29:37.600]  If you've got 6,000 pages, you've got micromanaged trade.
[03:29:38.061 --> 03:29:39.762]  And that's what we have with these trade agreements.
[03:29:39.782 --> 03:29:41.863]  When we come back, I want to talk about
[03:29:42.742 --> 03:29:54.344]  Gary Johnson reversing his position on vaccines, and what that tells us about how they have abandoned libertarianism, and the five lame excuses we have when we pass laws.
[03:29:54.364 --> 03:29:54.805]  Stay with us.
[03:29:54.985 --> 03:29:55.585]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:59.606 --> 03:30:00.506]  We're on the march.
[03:30:01.006 --> 03:30:02.606]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.526 --> 03:30:06.227]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:11.591 --> 03:30:16.978]  76-year-old veteran Peter Kazin shot himself this week in the parking lot of the VA Medical Center in Long Island.
[03:30:17.178 --> 03:30:25.969]  The hospital is part of the Veterans Affairs medical system that has been under major scrutiny since 2014 for covering up long waiting times for veterans seeking medical care.
[03:30:26.209 --> 03:30:31.256]  He went to the ER and was denied service, one worker said, and then he went out to his car and he shot himself.
[03:30:31.496 --> 03:30:40.188]  His case is reminiscent of yet another veteran, a 51-year-old named Charles Ingram, who set himself on fire outside the Department of Veterans Affairs clinic in New Jersey.
[03:30:40.208 --> 03:30:43.593]  A similar case of no access to care was given.
[03:30:44.093 --> 03:30:47.815]  One report says 22 veterans kill themselves every day in this country.
[03:30:48.055 --> 03:30:55.840]  President Obama said that no veteran should have to fill out a 23-page claim to get care or wait months or even years to get an appointment at the VA.
[03:30:55.940 --> 03:30:58.902]  Now he was a candidate, not president yet, when he said this.
[03:30:59.222 --> 03:31:05.746]  It looks like long after, into his presidency, little has changed for those who serve our nation when it comes to VA clinics in this country.
[03:31:05.766 --> 03:31:08.548]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.com.
[03:31:10.802 --> 03:31:12.643]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:31:12.703 --> 03:31:14.583]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:31:14.723 --> 03:31:17.524]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:31:17.624 --> 03:31:23.505]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:23.685 --> 03:31:32.588]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:31:32.888 --> 03:31:40.030]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:40.430 --> 03:31:48.134]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:48.454 --> 03:31:49.435]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:50.636 --> 03:31:52.937]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:54.578 --> 03:31:57.980]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:58.140 --> 03:32:04.643]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:32:04.864 --> 03:32:08.946]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:32:10.743 --> 03:32:11.764]  Brain Force is here.
[03:32:12.304 --> 03:32:14.586]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:32:14.846 --> 03:32:22.671]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:32:23.447 --> 03:32:27.030]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[03:32:27.050 --> 03:32:29.391]  You're gonna crash and gonna feel really bad afterwards.
[03:32:29.751 --> 03:32:33.274]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[03:32:33.314 --> 03:32:36.456]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[03:32:36.957 --> 03:32:41.740]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[03:32:42.300 --> 03:32:44.122]  For example, the L-theanine inside of it.
[03:32:44.482 --> 03:32:48.905]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[03:32:49.045 --> 03:32:51.086]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[03:32:51.687 --> 03:32:53.168]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[03:32:53.308 --> 03:32:53.548]  Exactly.
[03:32:53.568 --> 03:32:57.353]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[03:32:57.874 --> 03:33:05.883]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:21.650 --> 03:33:23.832]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[03:33:24.312 --> 03:33:26.754]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:33:27.315 --> 03:33:29.637]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:33.228 --> 03:33:40.031]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on the 269th day since Hillary Clinton has not had a press conference.
[03:33:40.071 --> 03:33:41.652]  We're going to hammer that on her every day.
[03:33:41.672 --> 03:33:47.355]  And today we find that the health care exchanges are falling far short of forecast.
[03:33:47.395 --> 03:34:00.741]  Washington Post reports, maybe with some concealed glee, although they say this is a grim though preliminary forecast, they say next year more than one in four counties are at risk of having a single insurer on its exchange.
[03:34:01.738 --> 03:34:16.204]  Now, any of you who remember Hillary Clinton as First Lady, immediately stepping out and trying to take over a massive segment of the economy, healthcare, and the fact that she kept pushing single-payer.
[03:34:16.324 --> 03:34:21.806]  And I heard this over and over again as we went to the public meetings, as I stood up and spoke out against it at public meetings.
[03:34:22.566 --> 03:34:23.207]  Single-payer!
[03:34:23.267 --> 03:34:24.167]  That's where we have to go!
[03:34:24.227 --> 03:34:26.388]  We have to, we can't afford competition!
[03:34:27.301 --> 03:34:28.322]  That was what they were telling people.
[03:34:28.662 --> 03:34:29.963]  Competition is too expensive.
[03:34:30.344 --> 03:34:33.307]  We can't have competition, so we have to have single payer.
[03:34:33.827 --> 03:34:39.933]  Obamacare, as Alex Jones has said, and we've all said here at InfoWars many, many times, Obamacare was designed to fail.
[03:34:39.953 --> 03:34:41.394]  It was designed to fail.
[03:34:42.155 --> 03:34:43.316]  How many years has it been now?
[03:34:43.396 --> 03:34:45.177]  Three, four years since they put this thing through?
[03:34:47.395 --> 03:34:49.776]  It was, I guess, three years that they put it through.
[03:34:50.176 --> 03:34:51.556]  And already, they're collapsing.
[03:34:51.596 --> 03:34:55.198]  But they're going to hide the collapse until after the election.
[03:34:55.338 --> 03:34:59.119]  They don't want you to know about the next massive waves of increases.
[03:34:59.159 --> 03:35:00.519]  This isn't working for the consumer.
[03:35:01.060 --> 03:35:05.121]  It's not working for most of the insurance companies, because there is no competition.
[03:35:06.175 --> 03:35:12.137]  See, that's the fundamental lie of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, that competition is a bad thing.
[03:35:12.717 --> 03:35:19.219]  See, on that issue, they're aligned with Rockefeller, who said competition is a sin.
[03:35:19.239 --> 03:35:19.919]  Okay?
[03:35:20.119 --> 03:35:22.539]  He wanted to drive out all of his competitors.
[03:35:22.800 --> 03:35:24.320]  He wanted monopoly pricing.
[03:35:24.600 --> 03:35:25.760]  We're talking about Gary Johnson.
[03:35:25.780 --> 03:35:31.482]  We're going to go back to him in just a moment, but with all this back and forth about EpiPen prices, okay?
[03:35:32.273 --> 03:35:37.157]  Understand that she is allowed to do that because she has no competition.
[03:35:38.358 --> 03:35:44.542]  The big insurance companies want to coerce you to buy their product and they want to make sure they are the only ones selling it.
[03:35:45.223 --> 03:35:51.508]  Uber wants to have a monopoly on transportation, on automobiles.
[03:35:51.528 --> 03:35:55.751]  They don't want you to own your automobile and they want you to have to rent from them.
[03:35:55.811 --> 03:35:58.153]  That's what all of these guys really want.
[03:35:58.213 --> 03:36:00.755]  They talk about how competition is a sin.
[03:36:01.075 --> 03:36:01.836]  They all believe that.
[03:36:02.296 --> 03:36:07.900]  And of course, as their paid puppet, Hillary Clinton sells that lie to you as well.
[03:36:07.940 --> 03:36:11.063]  Let's look at this with the EpiPen case, for example, okay?
[03:36:11.903 --> 03:36:25.674]  Washington Post talks about today that the drug maker, Mylan, who makes EpiPens, is now graciously consented to put out a generic branded EpiPen for half the price, for $300.
[03:36:25.874 --> 03:36:27.816]  So first they jack this thing up
[03:36:28.539 --> 03:36:29.699]  Okay.
[03:36:29.779 --> 03:36:32.860]  Ridiculously expensive price.
[03:36:33.220 --> 03:36:34.421]  And then they say, oh, but that's okay.
[03:36:34.661 --> 03:36:44.323]  We'll put one out there, which we still make, but we'll put a generic label on it and we'll only charge you $300 for it, which is still many times the price that it was just recently.
[03:36:44.343 --> 03:36:44.964]  Okay?
[03:36:45.284 --> 03:36:52.766]  And they say this will allow Mylan, the company that makes EpiPen, to segment the market because some people will continue to buy the brand name product.
[03:36:52.786 --> 03:36:52.926]  Yeah.
[03:36:53.186 --> 03:36:54.466]  Who would those people be?
[03:36:55.406 --> 03:36:57.027]  Those people would be the people who
[03:36:57.947 --> 03:37:00.289]  Don't have their doctors write them a new prescription.
[03:37:00.609 --> 03:37:02.431]  We're going to talk about how that works in just a moment here.
[03:37:02.591 --> 03:37:10.478]  They say the introduction of Mylan's generic also won't automatically open the window to true competition from other generic companies.
[03:37:10.758 --> 03:37:12.000]  We've seen this before.
[03:37:12.813 --> 03:37:16.375]  Remember, it was just a couple years ago, if it was that long, maybe it's a year and a half.
[03:37:16.575 --> 03:37:20.318]  Remember the pill for AIDS that went from $13.50 to $750 a pill?
[03:37:20.438 --> 03:37:26.882]  It was a hedge fund manager who bought Turing Pharmaceutical.
[03:37:27.522 --> 03:37:39.110]  And he said, hey, he noticed that they've got this drug, and it's Daraprim, and even though this thing has long since passed into the public domain, essentially, no longer had a copyright,
[03:37:39.730 --> 03:37:46.252]  He understood that competitors could not come into existence for many years because of FDA regulations.
[03:37:46.272 --> 03:37:46.932]  Do you understand that?
[03:37:47.352 --> 03:37:50.673]  This is a drug, this Daraprim, and this is the older case.
[03:37:51.533 --> 03:37:53.213]  It was created back in the 1950s.
[03:37:53.354 --> 03:37:56.314]  It was not copyrighted anymore.
[03:37:56.694 --> 03:38:03.016]  So, in theory, you would think, wouldn't you, that other companies could go into competition with them with generics, but that's not the way that it works out.
[03:38:03.076 --> 03:38:06.517]  They had a de facto monopoly, and I'm quoting now from Mary Ruhart,
[03:38:06.897 --> 03:38:20.467]  You see, Ruart.com, that's R-U-W-A-R-T, she is a doctor, she is a real libertarian from back in the old days before Gary Johnson took over the party and started changing the principles, jettisoning the principles.
[03:38:20.688 --> 03:38:35.519]  But she pointed out that Turing Pharmaceuticals has a de facto monopoly, courtesy of the ever-increasing cost of gaining FDA approval, both for new drugs, it costs over a billion dollars, and it takes 11 years for your generic to be approved by the FDA.
[03:38:35.979 --> 03:38:45.710]  So even though the drug itself is no longer patented, you still have to go through the FDA process of 11 years and a billion dollars before you can put something in competition to this guy.
[03:38:45.750 --> 03:38:49.174]  That's why he bought the company and raised the price of the pills from $13 to $750 a pill.
[03:38:52.037 --> 03:38:52.797]  It's the government.
[03:38:53.437 --> 03:38:55.338]  It's the government shutting down competition.
[03:38:55.878 --> 03:39:06.841]  And it's the government shutting down competition that is causing our insurance prices to go through the roof for the benefit of a few crony capitalists who are well connected to people like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[03:39:07.641 --> 03:39:09.182]  That's the truth of what's going on.
[03:39:09.662 --> 03:39:14.243]  You can try to blame capitalism about it, but it is a lack of free market.
[03:39:14.643 --> 03:39:18.284]  It's a failure to have a free market, not a failure of the free market.
[03:39:18.705 --> 03:39:19.785]  Now what's going on with EpiPen?
[03:39:20.836 --> 03:39:26.440]  Again, Mary Ruart points out the truth, and she understands this as a libertarian and as a medical doctor.
[03:39:26.480 --> 03:39:34.645]  She says, last October, Sanofi withdrew EpiPen's last true competitor from the market after some suspected device malfunctions.
[03:39:34.685 --> 03:39:43.611]  Without competition, Mylan, which makes EpiPen, and they acquired it in 2007 when it was selling for $57, raised their prices to $600 for a two-pack.
[03:39:48.308 --> 03:39:50.751]  She says she was actually quoted $800 at her pharmacy.
[03:39:50.791 --> 03:39:51.913]  So they get this thing that was about $57.
[03:39:52.774 --> 03:39:53.575]  They raise the price to $600.
[03:39:53.856 --> 03:39:59.103]  Now they say, after everybody's angry with them, all right, we'll put out a generic brand and we'll only charge you $300.
[03:39:59.223 --> 03:40:00.665]  Wait a minute, it was $57 not too long ago.
[03:40:03.345 --> 03:40:09.552]  Now, they say Teva had submitted, another drug company, had submitted an application for a generic version of EpiPen to the FDA.
[03:40:09.612 --> 03:40:20.105]  However, the agency felt, quote, certain major deficiencies, unquote, needed to be addressed, so marketing of EpiPen's new competitor will be delayed until at least 2017.
[03:40:22.307 --> 03:40:27.974]  So they got a window of a couple years and they're gonna cash in on that because there is no competition.
[03:40:27.994 --> 03:40:28.775]  Do you understand?
[03:40:29.235 --> 03:40:30.577]  There's no competition in healthcare.
[03:40:31.037 --> 03:40:37.485]  Everything that big pharmaceuticals and the big insurance companies are doing is using government to shut down competition.
[03:40:37.545 --> 03:40:42.530]  They can buy influence with people like Hillary Clinton very easily and they can shut down competition.
[03:40:43.191 --> 03:40:48.714]  Meruart goes on to say, in the meantime, consumers are usually unaware that there's still another less expensive alternative.
[03:40:48.734 --> 03:40:54.738]  So, if you need EpiPen, listen to me right now, because I'm going to give you a lower cost alternative.
[03:40:55.198 --> 03:40:56.699]  It's something called Adrenaclick.
[03:40:57.420 --> 03:40:59.681]  It's similar to, but not identical to, EpiPen.
[03:41:00.141 --> 03:41:02.403]  It's available for a fraction of the price.
[03:41:02.743 --> 03:41:03.524]  But here's what she says.
[03:41:03.564 --> 03:41:04.084]  Here's the catch.
[03:41:04.564 --> 03:41:09.007]  Be sure you become familiar with it because it has two caps that need to be removed instead of EpiPen's one.
[03:41:09.487 --> 03:41:10.428]  Very complicated.
[03:41:10.768 --> 03:41:11.889]  Big difference, isn't it?
[03:41:12.509 --> 03:41:19.672]  But the FDA will not allow your pharmacist to substitute adrenoclic unless your doctor rewrites your prescription.
[03:41:19.812 --> 03:41:20.012]  See?
[03:41:20.673 --> 03:41:25.075]  That's the way FDA works with the big pharmaceutical companies to make them money.
[03:41:25.455 --> 03:41:40.402]  So even though this thing has the same blood levels of epinephrine, even though it's the same drug, epinephrine, at the same levels, and the dose is the same, because it's a different name, your doctor will have to write you a different
[03:41:41.141 --> 03:41:43.162]  Prescription so it's a fraction of the price.
[03:41:43.202 --> 03:42:04.917]  It's called adrenoclic and that's one way that you can momentarily get around The crony capitalism that we see being pushed through by these regulatory agencies That have become captive to the government now as I pointed out before Donald Trump and he doesn't talk about this because he has to speak to people at a fourth grade level and
[03:42:05.472 --> 03:42:13.276]  But he's hired people to write his health care reform policy for him and it is one of the best health care reform policies I've seen.
[03:42:14.037 --> 03:42:16.178]  Any libertarian or conservative would love this.
[03:42:16.358 --> 03:42:23.742]  Any liberal who understood the fact that the reason these things are expensive is because we don't have competition would love this program.
[03:42:23.942 --> 03:42:25.243]  Because what does this program do?
[03:42:25.843 --> 03:42:31.086]  This program removes mandates and thought laws from the federal government
[03:42:31.866 --> 03:42:33.447]  It allows us to make choices.
[03:42:34.008 --> 03:42:37.750]  It allows us to have tax deductions and money on our own.
[03:42:38.311 --> 03:42:44.875]  It allows us to have information about the quality and the cost of health care providers.
[03:42:45.436 --> 03:42:48.838]  So we've got all the ingredients there that you need in a marketplace.
[03:42:49.278 --> 03:42:55.023]  Oh, and also competition, that he was ruthlessly ridiculed for in the debates by Marco Rubio.
[03:42:55.783 --> 03:43:04.691]  Every time Donald Trump would start to try to explain it, he'd say, and this is why he has to talk on fourth grade levels, because he started to say, we're going to erase those lines.
[03:43:04.772 --> 03:43:05.452]  What are the lines?
[03:43:05.472 --> 03:43:07.514]  The lines are the state boundaries.
[03:43:08.095 --> 03:43:12.279]  Insurance companies are not allowed to sell insurance across state lines.
[03:43:13.072 --> 03:43:26.676]  If free trade is good, all these people who are supporting Obamacare and who are supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, all these globalists, all the people at the top of the Republican and the Democrat Party are constantly telling us free trade is great, we gotta have free trade.
[03:43:27.196 --> 03:43:30.217]  We're not allowed to have free trade on insurance within our own country.
[03:43:31.217 --> 03:43:31.777]  How can that be?
[03:43:32.337 --> 03:43:34.598]  How can they tell us that free trade is such a great deal?
[03:43:34.618 --> 03:43:37.299]  And it is if it's truly free trade, if it's real competition.
[03:43:37.819 --> 03:43:41.240]  And yet what they do is they block competition within America.
[03:43:42.133 --> 03:43:56.920]  Remember, the Commerce Clause in the Constitution was set up to prevent precisely the type of situation we have with health care right now.
[03:43:57.480 --> 03:44:01.542]  It was set up to shut down any kind of trade barriers, state to state.
[03:44:01.722 --> 03:44:03.383]  Any kind of competition, state to state.
[03:44:04.335 --> 03:44:06.557]  And so they ignore its true function.
[03:44:07.157 --> 03:44:14.704]  And instead, they use the Commerce Clause to interject the federal government into areas in which they have absolutely no authority.
[03:44:15.304 --> 03:44:16.826]  That's the way the feds run this thing.
[03:44:17.186 --> 03:44:27.074]  But if we look at the market situation, and again, as Donald Trump would say, we've got to get rid of the lines, the state lines that prohibit competition, and Marco Rubio just, lines, lines, what are you talking about?
[03:44:27.114 --> 03:44:28.255]  What's he talking about with the lines?
[03:44:29.016 --> 03:44:31.465]  That works, when you're talking to four-year-olds.
[03:44:31.866 --> 03:44:32.187]  Okay?
[03:44:32.227 --> 03:44:35.177]  That's why Donald Trump gave up, I think, and said, alright, fine.
[03:44:36.305 --> 03:44:39.227]  Anybody that can read can go to his site.
[03:44:39.647 --> 03:44:57.579]  They can look at the seven-point program that has price transparency that allows you to know what you're going to get in terms of information about health care providers, cost information, success information, as well as giving you health savings accounts, deductions on your income tax, and let's talk about that.
[03:44:58.159 --> 03:45:01.862]  They always want to talk about these agendas that they have, like health care, for example.
[03:45:02.422 --> 03:45:05.144]  If health care is so important, or education is so important, and they are,
[03:45:06.226 --> 03:45:08.006]  Why not allow us to take them as credits?
[03:45:09.507 --> 03:45:20.270]  Why not allow us to take all of our medical expenses, insurance, our costs as credits and not pay income tax until we have paid for those things that they say are so important?
[03:45:20.930 --> 03:45:26.991]  No, it's only important to the extent that they can use it to exert power and control over your life.
[03:45:27.272 --> 03:45:28.972]  Otherwise, it's not really very important to them.
[03:45:30.285 --> 03:45:32.167]  Now, let's talk about Gary Johnson.
[03:45:32.187 --> 03:45:42.299]  Let's talk about mandatory vaccines, because I gave you the real libertarian position on markets and what's really wrong with EpiPen and these other drugs that are there.
[03:45:42.319 --> 03:45:44.862]  But let's talk about vaccinations, okay?
[03:45:45.950 --> 03:45:47.891]  Gary Johnson has now altered his position.
[03:45:47.931 --> 03:45:50.313]  This is the guy who's putting himself out there as a libertarian.
[03:45:50.333 --> 03:46:00.839]  And my objection to Gary Johnson being in the debates, I don't like the idea that candidates who are on the ballot in enough states, because it's so difficult to get on the ballot, that's one of the ways that they rig elections.
[03:46:01.520 --> 03:46:06.643]  Candidates and parties who are on the ballot in enough states to win ought to be included in the debates, period.
[03:46:08.044 --> 03:46:17.470]  And they came up with this ridiculous level of 15 percent, which comes out of their polls, which they control, and it is grossly unfair.
[03:46:17.911 --> 03:46:24.115]  And I agree with them on that, and we fought that as much as we could when we were working in North Carolina with the Libertarian Party.
[03:46:24.675 --> 03:46:33.021]  However, my concern with Gary Johnson being in the debates is that he is going to take a word that has finally begun to mean something to people.
[03:46:33.501 --> 03:46:37.003]  Twenty-five years ago, when we'd tell people libertarians, they didn't understand what that was.
[03:46:38.044 --> 03:46:49.019]  The guy who was running for president of the Libertarian Party, his dad got up to endorse him and to put his name in nomination and his dad thought it was the Libertine Party or the Librarian Party.
[03:46:49.500 --> 03:46:50.621]  That's what we used to get all the time.
[03:46:50.682 --> 03:46:51.322]  Or the Liberals.
[03:46:51.362 --> 03:46:52.584]  We would always be called the Liberals.
[03:46:52.945 --> 03:46:54.086]  They didn't understand the distinction.
[03:46:54.787 --> 03:47:13.258]  And now, just as people are starting to understand and see libertarian as meaning somebody who supports individual liberty, we're going to have somebody as the face of libertarianism who is nothing but a corporate crony capitalist pushing a globalist agenda and doing it in order to suck up money for the LP.
[03:47:13.758 --> 03:47:17.901]  If they can get 5% of the vote, then they get federal matching funds and they get on the federal tit.
[03:47:18.401 --> 03:47:18.661]  Okay?
[03:47:18.841 --> 03:47:19.602]  That's what he wants.
[03:47:20.642 --> 03:47:21.483]  A pox on them.
[03:47:22.571 --> 03:47:28.016]  We used to have the debate, and we used to vote against any Libertarian candidate who said that they would even accept federal funds.
[03:47:28.256 --> 03:47:34.662]  That has become the entire rationale for the Libertarian campaign that they're running this time.
[03:47:34.842 --> 03:47:43.930]  That, of course, and probably some kind of deal they've made with Hillary Clinton, because these two guys, Johnson and Weld, will never say anything bad about Hillary Clinton.
[03:47:44.271 --> 03:47:45.812]  It's absolutely amazing.
[03:47:46.132 --> 03:47:47.534]  They give her a pass on everything.
[03:47:47.554 --> 03:47:48.554]  You're talking about sycophants.
[03:47:49.255 --> 03:47:50.996]  These two guys are the biggest sycophants.
[03:47:51.016 --> 03:47:52.257]  But let's talk about real issues.
[03:47:52.297 --> 03:47:54.458]  Let's talk about mandatory vaccination.
[03:47:55.279 --> 03:48:11.348]  Johnson had previously held a staunchly, and this is Libertarian Republic, we have this up at Infowars, Johnson previously held a staunchly pro-choice position, allowing each individual to choose for himself, each parent to choose on behalf of their child, whether or not to vaccinate.
[03:48:12.429 --> 03:48:14.930]  Did you hear that word, that phrase, pro-choice?
[03:48:15.310 --> 03:48:15.711]  Pro-choice?
[03:48:16.633 --> 03:48:23.745]  You realize, of course, that pro-choice to these people doesn't mean anything other than whether you want to kill your child.
[03:48:24.861 --> 03:48:29.845]  Just in the realm of the family, pro-choice to them doesn't mean that you get to choose how your child is going to be educated.
[03:48:29.885 --> 03:48:31.886]  No, they want to shut down homeschooling.
[03:48:32.507 --> 03:48:42.094]  It doesn't mean that you get to choose what values you're going to give to your child, or how you're going to feed your child, or even what kind of medical care you're going to be allowed to give your child.
[03:48:42.154 --> 03:48:48.839]  No, your children belong to the state as far as Gary Johnson and these other statists believe, okay?
[03:48:49.159 --> 03:48:51.361]  There is no such thing as pro-choice unless
[03:48:52.363 --> 03:48:53.303]  You want to kill your child.
[03:48:53.623 --> 03:48:56.244]  In that case, they'll do everything they can to aid you.
[03:48:56.284 --> 03:49:00.205]  As a matter of fact, Gary Johnson said, you know, I recognize the right of a woman to choose.
[03:49:00.325 --> 03:49:02.025]  It's the law of the land, blah, blah, blah.
[03:49:02.045 --> 03:49:03.105]  We have to respect this right.
[03:49:03.125 --> 03:49:09.407]  He said many times, and I've heard this phrase many times, to the Libertarian Party, we've got to get government out of the bedroom and out of the boardroom.
[03:49:10.127 --> 03:49:11.147]  Well, you know what?
[03:49:11.647 --> 03:49:15.088]  They don't want to get government out of your bloodstream, do they?
[03:49:15.814 --> 03:49:20.696]  They're going to let government stick you, stick your children, with anything that they demand.
[03:49:21.536 --> 03:49:22.437]  And this is what he said.
[03:49:22.537 --> 03:49:23.317]  Listen to his opinion.
[03:49:23.637 --> 03:49:27.699]  He said, in my opinion, this is Gary Johnson speaking, the quote-unquote libertarian.
[03:49:28.079 --> 03:49:29.260]  Now he's the LP candidate.
[03:49:29.320 --> 03:49:30.600]  Let's just call it that, the LP.
[03:49:31.701 --> 03:49:34.622]  The LP candidate says, in my opinion, this is a local issue.
[03:49:35.122 --> 03:49:39.384]  If it ends up being a federal issue, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[03:49:39.624 --> 03:49:41.625]  First of all, it's not a local issue.
[03:49:43.179 --> 03:49:46.521]  The local government doesn't get to tell me what I do with my body, Gary.
[03:49:47.081 --> 03:49:53.144]  You want to talk about getting your hands off of our body and leaving women's bodies alone so that they can abort their children?
[03:49:53.405 --> 03:49:58.187]  How about getting your hands off of my body when it comes to mandated vaccines, okay?
[03:49:58.767 --> 03:50:00.028]  So it's not a local issue.
[03:50:00.488 --> 03:50:05.311]  And it doesn't, if it ends up being a federal issue, he says, who would determine that it's a federal issue?
[03:50:06.101 --> 03:50:08.743]  Would that be the federal government usurping its power once again?
[03:50:08.823 --> 03:50:12.585]  Why can't we have a Libertarian candidate who supports the Constitution?
[03:50:14.226 --> 03:50:19.330]  He doesn't understand the Tenth Amendment, and that's understandable because he doesn't understand the Second Amendment either.
[03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:23.352]  He and his candidate, William Wells, supported an assault weapon ban.
[03:50:23.812 --> 03:50:24.033]  Okay?
[03:50:24.929 --> 03:50:31.073]  The guy he demanded to have on the ticket with him supported an assault weapon ban in Massachusetts.
[03:50:31.514 --> 03:50:36.277]  They don't understand or value or respect the Constitution.
[03:50:36.717 --> 03:50:39.259]  And they don't respect the 10th Amendment either.
[03:50:39.579 --> 03:50:42.962]  If it ends up being a federal issue, there is nothing in the Constitution.
[03:50:43.442 --> 03:50:46.186]  That says the federal government can dictate your medical care.
[03:50:46.226 --> 03:50:49.370]  They can't dictate whether or not you get insurance even.
[03:50:49.710 --> 03:50:59.323]  And of course, that was taken care of when we had a federal judge, a Supreme Court judge, Roberts, being blackmailed, writing both the dissenting and the concurring opinion.
[03:50:59.363 --> 03:51:01.465]  Don't tell me Roberts wasn't blackmailed.
[03:51:01.966 --> 03:51:02.967]  That was open corruption.
[03:51:02.987 --> 03:51:08.673]  He said, if it came down to be a federal issue, I would come down the side of science and require the vaccine.
[03:51:09.193 --> 03:51:10.535]  He ignores individual rights.
[03:51:10.835 --> 03:51:15.740]  Let's talk about Amerigeddon, which is available at Infowarsstore.com exclusively right now.
[03:51:16.020 --> 03:51:19.764]  For the next week or so, you get two copies and you get two free films with it.
[03:51:19.844 --> 03:51:22.365]  Yeah, this is an important movie because it's fact-based.
[03:51:23.265 --> 03:51:29.647]  We tell a story about an EMP attack, an electromagnetic pulse attack on America that shuts down the grid.
[03:51:30.187 --> 03:51:37.149]  And our Congress has warned that if this were to happen, 90% of the American population would die in 12 months.
[03:51:37.709 --> 03:51:42.370]  To quote Henry Kissinger, the only thing standing in the way of a new world order is a strong America.
[03:51:42.990 --> 03:51:50.912]  One of the ways that they can diminish America quickly and severely is to allow for an EMP attack on this country.
[03:51:51.453 --> 03:51:57.214]  And in light of the events and things that are happening, I'm afraid this is a very likely scenario.
[03:51:57.274 --> 03:51:58.294]  So I made a movie about it.
[03:51:58.594 --> 03:52:00.755]  It's an entertaining movie, but it's fact-based.
[03:52:01.295 --> 03:52:07.577]  People are getting the director's cut that is even bigger than what you see in theaters, and so this is the first look director's cut.
[03:52:07.597 --> 03:52:17.299]  You know, Hollywood has tried to diminish the final edit on this thing, but what Alex has available here at his website this week is everything.
[03:52:17.439 --> 03:52:18.419]  The most hardcore version.
[03:52:18.639 --> 03:52:18.799]  Yep.
[03:52:19.360 --> 03:52:25.221]  So this is a great place to acquire the movie and then to show it to your friends and family and even your churches.
[03:52:25.421 --> 03:52:46.840]  That's right, you can get one copy of the film Amerigeddon on DVD at Infowarsstore.com exclusively right now, or get a second copy, two copies for $39.90 and get my first film, America Destroyed by Design, and then one of my latest, most powerful films, Fall of the Republic, that breaks down everything currently happening, free.
[03:52:47.120 --> 03:52:52.425]  Two films free when you purchase two Amerigeddons, and I'm doing that because I want
[03:52:52.905 --> 03:52:54.446]  to get this film out.
[03:52:54.746 --> 03:53:02.330]  Another big thing people can do if you really want to reach a lot of people, get two copies, keep one for your own archive to share, take the other and donate it to the library.
[03:53:02.831 --> 03:53:06.413]  So many people are smart because they've closed all the video stores.
[03:53:06.433 --> 03:53:17.599]  I was reading an article about this in the Wall Street Journal about a year ago, that what's the most popular now at libraries is not the books anymore, but is people going and actually checking out the DVDs, the Blu-rays, all that.
[03:53:18.079 --> 03:53:20.901]  And so that's why you make a donation of this to your library,
[03:53:21.681 --> 03:53:26.525]  You're going to talk about hundreds of people that are going to check that out and watch it.
[03:53:28.026 --> 03:53:28.946]  That is amazing.
[03:53:29.307 --> 03:53:29.827]  All of that.
[03:53:29.887 --> 03:53:45.699]  I can't tell you how many listeners we run into on the street that found this show, not on a local M or FM station, but over the internet over the years, that somebody gave them a DVD or somebody gave them a card with forbidden information, InfoWars.com, or they saw a bumper sticker, and it's just exponential.
[03:53:45.799 --> 03:53:46.359]  It's exponential.
[03:53:46.840 --> 03:53:50.763]  I can't imagine where InfoWars will be in a year, two years, three years.
[03:53:51.804 --> 03:53:55.949]  And I just pray to God that I can be humble and focus and make the right decisions with this great responsibility.
[03:53:55.989 --> 03:53:57.251]  But it's not just Alex Jones.
[03:53:57.552 --> 03:53:58.393]  It's what Gary Haven's doing.
[03:53:58.413 --> 03:53:59.314]  It's what Matt Drudge is doing.
[03:53:59.334 --> 03:54:00.395]  It's what World Net Daily is doing.
[03:54:00.436 --> 03:54:04.000]  It's what people like Donald Trump are doing.
[03:54:04.421 --> 03:54:07.806]  We all are just choosing to not be with the new world order.
[03:54:23.851 --> 03:54:25.213]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:25.233 --> 03:54:29.519]  In our last segment here, I want to finish up on this whole idea of mandatory vaccine.
[03:54:29.559 --> 03:54:33.284]  And I want to cover something from the Foundation for Economic Education.
[03:54:33.544 --> 03:54:35.888]  Again, a real libertarian publication.
[03:54:36.348 --> 03:54:38.631]  They talk about five lame excuses.
[03:54:39.252 --> 03:54:40.393]  For passing laws.
[03:54:40.493 --> 03:54:42.175]  And I'm going to give you those five excuses.
[03:54:42.215 --> 03:54:42.915]  You've heard them all.
[03:54:43.316 --> 03:54:46.779]  And this is a classic article that really nails it.
[03:54:46.999 --> 03:54:52.104]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to remind you we've got a sale on Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix.
[03:54:52.244 --> 03:54:55.166]  It's 20% off right now at Infowarslife.com.
[03:54:55.286 --> 03:55:02.253]  Again, this is, in each of these containers you get a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids.
[03:55:02.853 --> 03:55:03.674]  That you can drink.
[03:55:03.694 --> 03:55:04.834]  You don't have to take a lot of pills.
[03:55:04.854 --> 03:55:05.575]  You can drink this.
[03:55:05.635 --> 03:55:07.276]  It makes it very bioavailable.
[03:55:07.896 --> 03:55:11.058]  All of these are plant-derived or the highest quality lab standard.
[03:55:11.458 --> 03:55:24.146]  And you get vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, magnesium, selenium, glutamine, alpha-lipaic acid, folic acid, calcium, and many others that I won't bother to try to murder.
[03:55:24.947 --> 03:55:28.849]  But you get the full list you can see at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:55:28.869 --> 03:55:29.490]  A great way
[03:55:30.070 --> 03:55:39.719]  To get your multivitamin supplementation, vitamins and minerals in a great tasting drink mix, 20% off right now at Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:40.239 --> 03:55:43.382]  Now, what are the five lame excuses for passing laws?
[03:55:44.363 --> 03:55:48.286]  Number one, the biggest one, protect the children.
[03:55:48.907 --> 03:55:50.929]  That's what we see with the mandatory vaccines, right?
[03:55:51.309 --> 03:55:52.750]  Protect the children.
[03:55:53.191 --> 03:55:54.612]  In other words, the government.
[03:55:55.332 --> 03:55:55.573]  Uncle.
[03:55:56.670 --> 03:55:57.311]  is the parent.
[03:55:57.752 --> 03:56:00.217]  Get over the idea that these children belong to you.
[03:56:00.377 --> 03:56:01.359]  They're not your kids.
[03:56:01.419 --> 03:56:05.106]  They belong to the village, and they're going to be the only ones who can protect them.
[03:56:05.126 --> 03:56:07.591]  And all this stuff that they're going to do is just to protect the children.
[03:56:09.226 --> 03:56:12.687]  The slippery slope, okay?
[03:56:13.487 --> 03:56:17.549]  Marijuana is going to be the slippery slope to drug addiction and so forth.
[03:56:17.589 --> 03:56:19.729]  Number three, it's for our safety.
[03:56:20.329 --> 03:56:22.190]  Always sacrifice your liberty for safety.
[03:56:22.630 --> 03:56:25.051]  Remember, it's always the promise of safety.
[03:56:25.671 --> 03:56:26.371]  Because you know what?
[03:56:26.991 --> 03:56:28.552]  Slaves are never free!
[03:56:30.351 --> 03:56:32.132]  And they're also never safe, is what I meant to say.
[03:56:32.512 --> 03:56:34.253]  Slaves are never safe.
[03:56:34.894 --> 03:56:35.174]  Okay?
[03:56:35.814 --> 03:56:39.417]  If you're going to give up your freedom, to that degree you're going to be a slave.
[03:56:39.977 --> 03:56:41.519]  Slaves are never safe.
[03:56:41.899 --> 03:56:45.301]  Number four, they're going to prevent bad choices for you.
[03:56:45.341 --> 03:56:49.064]  And of course, they will define what the bad choices are.
[03:56:49.084 --> 03:56:51.125]  And number five,
[03:56:52.188 --> 03:56:52.788]  It's the law.
[03:56:53.168 --> 03:56:54.909]  In other words, I say so.
[03:56:55.849 --> 03:56:59.230]  Even when they don't have a law that allows them to do that.
[03:56:59.410 --> 03:57:12.114]  Just as we saw with Gary Johnson saying, well, yeah, I think it's a vaccinations or a local issue, but if it becomes a federal issue, and it's like, there is no legitimacy to it becoming a local issue, if you're going to stand for individual rights.
[03:57:12.474 --> 03:57:20.616]  And there's certainly, under the Constitution, there is no legitimacy for vaccinations, mandatory vaccinations, becoming a federal issue.
[03:57:22.185 --> 03:57:25.087]  Okay, but let's look at what he's been pushing with the rest of this stuff, okay?
[03:57:25.127 --> 03:57:28.410]  He's been pushing things like carbon credits.
[03:57:28.630 --> 03:57:35.296]  We mentioned this when this came out briefly, and of course Daily Caller has talked about it, TheMises.org has talked about it.
[03:57:35.316 --> 03:57:37.077]  We carried that article at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:37.537 --> 03:57:43.062]  Many people have pointed out to Gary Johnson, Gary, there is no free market carbon tax.
[03:57:43.222 --> 03:57:43.842]  That's what he's saying.
[03:57:43.883 --> 03:57:50.168]  He says, I believe in man-made global warming, Gary Johnson says, and we have to do something about it.
[03:57:50.828 --> 03:57:57.932]  And so I think we need to have a free market approach, so I'm going to put a fee on carbon dioxide emissions.
[03:57:58.012 --> 03:58:04.997]  Now remember, we had Mitt Romney running, and he talked about how, oh, I cut all these taxes, I didn't raise any taxes on people.
[03:58:05.117 --> 03:58:06.838]  Look at all these fees you imposed on people.
[03:58:07.098 --> 03:58:09.980]  Oh, he said, Mitt Romney, fees are not taxes.
[03:58:10.160 --> 03:58:10.560]  Remember that?
[03:58:10.740 --> 03:58:12.021]  Remember that lie that he had?
[03:58:12.441 --> 03:58:13.442]  Fees are not taxes?
[03:58:13.962 --> 03:58:20.166]  Gary Johnson, I guess William Weld from Massachusetts, friend of Mitt Romney, was telling him, tell people that it's just a fee.
[03:58:20.566 --> 03:58:22.167]  Don't tell them it's a tax, okay?
[03:58:22.488 --> 03:58:29.953]  Don't tell them that we're going to rob this activity over here in order to subsidize or mandate this other activity over here.
[03:58:30.414 --> 03:58:33.996]  You know, it is not a free market solution to put carbon taxes on.
[03:58:34.236 --> 03:58:38.320]  It is a globalist, crony-capitalist solution.
[03:58:38.660 --> 03:58:40.041]  And that's what Gary Johnson's become.
[03:58:40.081 --> 03:58:41.062]  That's it for our broadcast.

[03:58:43.724 --> 03:58:44.004]  Eastern.

[03:59:00.950 --> 03:59:07.293]  The official Black Lives Matter website vows to destroy the nuclear family and replace it with communist-style collective parenting.
[03:59:07.454 --> 03:59:18.080]  Black Lives Matter says, quote, we are committed to disrupting the Western prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and villages that collectively care for one another.
[03:59:18.260 --> 03:59:22.362]  And especially our children to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.
[03:59:22.502 --> 03:59:30.245]  Paul Joseph Watson points out that the notion of collective communities being responsible for children and not parents is an idea that has been pushed by the leftist establishment before.
[03:59:30.405 --> 03:59:35.787]  Most notably by MSNBC's Melissa Harris-Perry in which she claimed the notion that kids belonging to their parents was outdated.
[03:59:35.947 --> 03:59:45.812]  The Black Lives Matter pledge is a reminder that the movement funded by billionaire socialist George Soros is actually a Marxist front meant to sabotage Western values more so than stopping police abuse.
[03:59:46.072 --> 03:59:55.597]  Instead of encouraging strong parenting in the black community, Black Lives Matter is telling parents that the traditional nuclear family is a bad idea and that they should give up control of their children.

[04:00:13.271 --> 04:00:19.119]  They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[04:00:21.262 --> 04:00:27.310]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[04:00:27.370 --> 04:00:30.394]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[04:00:38.490 --> 04:00:39.150]  Amarillo by morning.
[04:00:39.491 --> 04:00:42.313]  Amarillo's where I'll be.

[04:00:56.142 --> 04:01:03.067]  Thematically every day looking at hundreds and hundreds of news stories.
[04:01:06.449 --> 04:01:07.290]  A theme will emerge.
[04:01:08.664 --> 04:01:16.190]  And more often than not, the number one theme is global censorship of news and information.
[04:01:18.091 --> 04:01:28.359]  Many people will look at the collapse of the dinosaur media and the collapse of its credibility as something positive, and I do overall, but really now, what do they have to lose?
[04:01:29.960 --> 04:01:36.405]  They have only intensified, and then intensified again, and then intensified again and again and again,
[04:01:37.745 --> 04:01:42.379]  The unification of deception and twisting information.
[04:01:44.464 --> 04:01:45.327]  But we have parallel...
