[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.228]  It's Friday, October 21st, 2016.
[00:00:14.528 --> 00:00:16.613]  Now only 17 days out.
[00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:17.937]  Start your engines!
[00:00:18.157 --> 00:00:19.280]  This is the InfoWar!
[00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:35.323]  The Al Smith Dinner, hosted by the Archbishop of New York, is an annual gathering of elites for Catholic charities supporting needy children held at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York on the third Thursday of October.
[00:00:35.583 --> 00:00:41.389]  The event honors former New York Governor Al Smith, the first Catholic presidential candidate.
[00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:46.091]  Ceremonially, it is the last event at which the two U.S.
[00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:49.613]  presidential candidates share a stage before the election.
[00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:56.517]  In the past, the event has been an occasion for American power brokers to rub elbows with their political pawns.
[00:00:57.278 --> 00:00:59.999]  Distinguished dais, better known as the top 1%.
[00:01:05.582 --> 00:01:06.403]  Thank you all very much.
[00:01:08.324 --> 00:01:09.965]  This is an impressive crowd, the haves.
[00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:11.902]  And they have mores.
[00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:21.008]  Of course, rules of fairness have to be enforced, because what other safeguard do we have besides the press?
[00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:33.857]  But this election year, being one of the strangest on record, presented yet another opportunity for Donald Trump to hold no quarter against Hillary Clinton.
[00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:40.482]  It's great to be here with a thousand wonderful people, or as I call it,
[00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.903]  A small, intimate dinner with some friends.
[00:01:46.284 --> 00:01:50.908]  Or as Hillary calls it, her largest crowd of the season.
[00:01:51.448 --> 00:01:59.754]  Hillary is so corrupt, she got kicked off the Watergate Commission.
[00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:07.900]  How corrupt do you have to be to get kicked off the Watergate Commission?
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.961]  Pretty corrupt.
[00:02:10.182 --> 00:02:14.963]  Hillary is and has been in politics since the 70s.
[00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:17.043]  What's her pitch?
[00:02:18.384 --> 00:02:19.544]  The economy is busted.
[00:02:20.884 --> 00:02:22.044]  The government's corrupt.
[00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:24.725]  Washington is failing.
[00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:27.165]  Vote for me.
[00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:31.526]  I've been working on these problems for 30 years.
[00:02:31.626 --> 00:02:32.887]  I can fix it, she says.
[00:02:34.747 --> 00:02:39.128]  I wasn't really sure if Hillary was going to be here tonight.
[00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:46.996]  Because I guess you didn't send her invitation by email.
[00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:54.138]  Or maybe you did, and she just found out about it through the wonder of WikiLeaks.
[00:02:56.098 --> 00:02:58.259]  We've learned so much from WikiLeaks.
[00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:06.961]  For example, Hillary believes that it's vital to deceive the people by having one public policy.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.883]  And a totally different policy in private.
[00:03:13.844 --> 00:03:14.445]  That's okay.
[00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:15.526]  I don't know who they're angry at.
[00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:16.386]  Hillary, you're right.
[00:03:17.207 --> 00:03:25.134]  For example, here she is tonight, in public, pretending not to hate Catholics.
[00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.604]  Now, if some of you haven't noticed, Hillary isn't laughing as much as the rest of us.
[00:03:37.202 --> 00:03:39.884]  That's because she knows the jokes.
[00:03:41.344 --> 00:03:49.289]  And all of the jokes were given to her in advance of the dinner by Donna Brazile.
[00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:58.154]  Which is, everyone knows, of course, Hillary's belief that it takes a village.
[00:03:59.595 --> 00:04:06.119]  Which only makes sense, after all, in places like Haiti, where she's taken a number of them.
[00:04:14.543 --> 00:04:15.044]  Thank you.
[00:04:15.064 --> 00:04:21.629]  I don't know, and I don't want this evening without saying something nice about my opponent.
[00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.332]  Hillary's been in Washington a long time.
[00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:27.874]  She knows a lot about how government works.
[00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:38.363]  And according to her sworn testimony, Hillary has forgotten more things than most of us will ever, ever know.
[00:04:38.723 --> 00:04:39.584]  That I can tell you.
[00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:50.236]  Of course, the media will spin this with the intent of containing Trump's populist message while simultaneously falling on their own sword.
[00:04:50.896 --> 00:04:53.699]  Truth be told, this is only the beginning.
[00:04:54.039 --> 00:05:03.466]  Whatever the outcome of the presidential election, the Clinton crime family will ultimately have to answer to the veracity growing within the American consciousness.
[00:05:04.046 --> 00:05:06.128]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com.
[00:05:06.308 --> 00:05:06.749]  That's right.
[00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:07.549]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:07.969]  Stay with us.
[00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:11.654]  U.S.
[00:05:11.694 --> 00:05:19.842]  intelligence and law enforcement officials are again coming out and warning of Russian interference in the United States presidential election, but this time in a different tone.
[00:05:20.102 --> 00:05:31.293]  Now the intelligence agencies say Russian hackers will undermine the upcoming election by posting documents online reporting to show evidence that election fraud had happened and that Russia is hacking voter registration bases.
[00:05:31.753 --> 00:05:40.757]  They went on to say that the election is so large it is impossible for a hacker to change the outcome, so instead Russia will just resort to reporting election fraud online, fraudulently.
[00:05:41.117 --> 00:05:42.897]  State and local authorities have been warned.
[00:05:43.178 --> 00:05:54.402]  So wait a second, we have mass amounts of evidence of voter fraud piling up almost daily, we have US officials warning of Russian interference, but Obama has never heard of a rigged election, and Trump is crazy for monitoring the results.
[00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:59.684]  The truth is, they've been caught trying to rig the election, so they are distracting and diverting the blame to Russia.
[00:05:59.804 --> 00:06:04.410]  So now every time you see election fraud happening, it doesn't exist and it's Russia's fault.
[00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.392]  This is Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com.
[00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:14.029]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:21.615]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:06:21.795 --> 00:06:32.824]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:40.794]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[00:06:41.094 --> 00:06:50.406]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[00:06:50.706 --> 00:06:54.910]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:06:55.151 --> 00:07:01.898]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:07:02.218 --> 00:07:03.339]  That means it's clean.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.741]  That means it's pure.
[00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.644]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:07:07.764 --> 00:07:09.446]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:07:10.106 --> 00:07:11.487]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:07:11.767 --> 00:07:13.068]  You can't survive without it.
[00:07:13.248 --> 00:07:14.168]  But where do you get it?
[00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:20.211]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:26.154]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:07:26.354 --> 00:07:43.236]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:07:43.616 --> 00:07:45.737]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:47.298]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:48.339]  Easy assembly.
[00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:49.220]  Low maintenance.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.341]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:08:23.386 --> 00:08:27.852]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:28.252 --> 00:08:31.316]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.645]  Coming up today, ladies and gentlemen, we're only 17 days out from the big event.
[00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:55.177]  Colonel Anthony Schaeffer will be joining us, the man that headed up the anti-bin Laden unit, the guy that's briefed Congress on the fact that almost all the Jihad fighters in Syria are Al Qaeda slash Wahhabis, so they had to change the name to ISIS to try to confuse the American people.
[00:08:56.098 --> 00:08:58.820]  And of course, James Wesley Rawls, formerly in Army Intelligence.
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:18.182]  Great researcher and analyst, best-selling author, will join us about the state of the world right now and the unraveling situation with the big Russian fleet now crossing past England and getting ready to come into, I guess, the Strait of Gibraltar and into the Mediterranean to give air support.
[00:09:19.963 --> 00:09:27.646]  To forces already in Syria and to try to block any type of NATO move to put up a no-fly zone.
[00:09:27.866 --> 00:09:28.866]  Things are escalating.
[00:09:29.346 --> 00:09:36.589]  Meanwhile, they're running TV ads that show nuclear missile silos and say that Donald Trump is dangerous and have a countdown with the world being destroyed.
[00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:42.291]  And it is Hillary Clinton and the globalists that are the real people that have been escalating the situation.
[00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:45.492]  And our own media says that Russia is escalating.
[00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:48.032]  No, Russia has been invited into Syria.
[00:09:48.112 --> 00:09:48.693]  It's its only
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.200]  I don't
[00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.530]  by Hillary and Obama.
[00:10:12.851 --> 00:10:24.434]  Now you've got the President of the Philippines for the first time since World War II coming out and saying, kick the US out, we're joining with China and we're going to let China basically move into the Philippines and let them take over the South China Sea.
[00:10:24.774 --> 00:10:32.637]  He was met at the airport with a red carpet by the President of China and he was given full military honors.
[00:10:32.977 --> 00:10:38.618]  Now, Obama was there a month ago and was made to come off the back of the plane with no honors.
[00:10:39.058 --> 00:10:40.239]  With the Chinese screaming,
[00:10:41.263 --> 00:10:42.684]  You're nothing, this is our country.
[00:10:43.504 --> 00:10:48.106]  Now, that's what Obama and Hillary and the globalists have done to this country.
[00:10:48.126 --> 00:10:50.127]  And it's going to get a lot worse.
[00:10:50.147 --> 00:10:53.149]  When they're done, we're going to be like one giant Venezuela.
[00:10:53.469 --> 00:10:53.909]  You watch!
[00:10:55.558 --> 00:10:56.759]  Because it's by design.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.980]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:10:58.361 --> 00:11:03.165]  They've got several articles out today going, oh my gosh, there's a huge exodus of doctors.
[00:11:03.446 --> 00:11:11.253]  They're almost all quitting because Obamacare is such a screw job and puts them under criminal charges, you name it, for nothing.
[00:11:11.714 --> 00:11:17.820]  I mean, you overcharge a dollar, or don't dot an I or cross a T, or follow what the HMOs say and try to be a doctor.
[00:11:19.577 --> 00:11:21.620]  And not just some robot that follows orders.
[00:11:22.221 --> 00:11:22.841]  You're arrested.
[00:11:22.901 --> 00:11:23.963]  So they're just leaving.
[00:11:24.003 --> 00:11:24.504]  They're quitting.
[00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:28.088]  Or they're refusing to take Obamacare.
[00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.111]  Patients, Medicare, Medicaid.
[00:11:31.092 --> 00:11:32.694]  This was always the plan.
[00:11:35.298 --> 00:11:36.179]  Was to bankrupt.
[00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:38.196]  The health care system.
[00:11:38.496 --> 00:11:41.678]  It was always meant to run the good Western doctors out.
[00:11:41.698 --> 00:11:45.419]  And when I say Western, I mean the history of the highest level of Hippocratic Oath.
[00:11:46.179 --> 00:11:46.739]  Do no harm.
[00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:52.561]  And then change the standards and bring in doctors from India, you name it, en masse.
[00:11:53.121 --> 00:11:54.322]  Nothing against Indian doctors.
[00:11:54.742 --> 00:12:00.704]  The point is this is happening to VA everywhere because they'll follow orders and they come from countries with much lower standards.
[00:12:01.926 --> 00:12:18.536]  Now, the WikiLeaks came out last week, I think it was data dump 11, we're up to 13 today, and it said right there, Hillary Clinton wanted it to fail to bring in single payer, but not some utopia socialism, so that only a few mega insurance companies would control the whole market.
[00:12:18.816 --> 00:12:19.817]  They're the ones that wrote it.
[00:12:20.457 --> 00:12:21.958]  To charge you more, not less.
[00:12:22.218 --> 00:12:25.340]  Make you buy it, charge you more, that's called slavery.
[00:12:26.281 --> 00:12:28.022]  That's the perfect corporate fascist model.
[00:12:29.383 --> 00:12:33.127]  Tell the dumbed-down masses that want a free handout, you're about to get free health care.
[00:12:33.408 --> 00:12:34.849]  Has your health care gotten cheaper?
[00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:35.250]  No.
[00:12:37.092 --> 00:12:38.754]  Did you get cut from full-time to part-time?
[00:12:38.894 --> 00:12:39.395]  Yes.
[00:12:40.156 --> 00:12:41.377]  Is the economy falling apart?
[00:12:41.437 --> 00:12:41.898]  Yes.
[00:12:42.218 --> 00:12:43.139]  It's a plan.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.903]  It's a plan to wreck the country is what I'm getting at.
[00:12:47.011 --> 00:12:51.635]  Wreck our military, wreck our name, while we build the global corporate government.
[00:12:52.076 --> 00:12:54.017]  And then they pivot and move to China.
[00:12:54.718 --> 00:12:59.682]  And by move, I mean move their command bases there, their military power there, their economic power.
[00:13:00.964 --> 00:13:03.466]  It's admitted it's a systematic world government plan.
[00:13:04.407 --> 00:13:09.691]  To have the Chinese century, not for the people, to use them up as basically biological androids to build the world government.
[00:13:10.852 --> 00:13:12.434]  And to leverage out all competition.
[00:13:14.724 --> 00:13:15.525]  And it's all happening.
[00:13:16.185 --> 00:13:19.147]  Henry Kissinger set up the whole deal with Zbigniew Brzezinski and others.
[00:13:19.167 --> 00:13:20.228]  They've all written books about it.
[00:13:20.608 --> 00:13:21.309]  It's now happening.
[00:13:22.309 --> 00:13:24.571]  How do we compete with energy three times cheaper than ours?
[00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:26.272]  Because we put regulations on ourselves.
[00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:35.698]  How do we compete when we gave them all the major deepwater ports, the Panama Canal and allowed China
[00:13:36.636 --> 00:13:39.740]  To dominate 90, I want to say 97 percent, I'm sorry.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.383]  New numbers came out, I saw it in the Wall Street Journal last week.
[00:13:42.903 --> 00:13:48.830]  Guess what percentage of rare earth minerals the Chinese now have worldwide?
[00:13:49.051 --> 00:13:49.491]  98 plus.
[00:13:50.753 --> 00:13:52.535]  It's estimated they may go to 100 percent.
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.062]  Now that's systematic and organized, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:58.702 --> 00:14:11.731]  And when rare earth minerals are 98% controlled by a country that every major city has mobile execution vans, they catch you being a Christian or being a Buddhist, you are taken and you are harvested.
[00:14:12.432 --> 00:14:14.213]  That's who our government wants to work with.
[00:14:14.593 --> 00:14:19.537]  That's what they want to model things off of with total internet censorship, the whole nine yards.
[00:14:19.857 --> 00:14:21.438]  Do you think we're safe, folks?
[00:14:26.493 --> 00:14:31.175]  Now, I want to ask you another question.
[00:14:33.016 --> 00:14:33.876]  What does it take?
[00:14:33.896 --> 00:14:42.160]  In fact, sometime, not today, because we have too much news to cover, but maybe next week, I show up with the phones up to actually hear from Hillary supporters, because I know they exist somewhere.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:43.901]  They are out there.
[00:14:45.101 --> 00:14:51.164]  And I really want to hear from you how you believe Hillary is better than Donald Trump.
[00:14:51.184 --> 00:14:55.926]  I mean, in what parallel universe, in what twisted, bizarro world is that true?
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.923]  But you look at the hype and all the weak-minded people that want to bet on a winner.
[00:15:03.584 --> 00:15:18.595]  When Hillary Clinton is the opposite of a winner, stumbling around last night at the big Catholic charity dinner in New York, almost falling down again, Kissinger like some demonic wolf eel comes slithering out of the back, creeping over to her.
[00:15:19.256 --> 00:15:20.857]  Those two commiserated for a while.
[00:15:20.957 --> 00:15:22.138]  It was just disgusting.
[00:15:24.119 --> 00:15:31.966]  It is totally disgusting to see how we've been sold out by design, our military technology, our dominance in mining worldwide.
[00:15:32.426 --> 00:15:43.475]  Do you understand that five years ago, under executive action, the final lead smelting plant in the United States was closed?
[00:15:46.073 --> 00:15:48.494]  No one in the United States smelts lead.
[00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:50.655]  It's totally clean under environmental controls.
[00:15:51.035 --> 00:15:57.337]  You have to have it for weights and aircraft and vehicles and all these other industrial uses.
[00:15:57.837 --> 00:16:00.458]  You've got to buy it from China.
[00:16:01.058 --> 00:16:05.239]  They have set up deals where almost everything has to come from China.
[00:16:05.579 --> 00:16:08.020]  They're even about to leverage out the fluoride market.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.601]  We're going to dump fluoride in the water.
[00:16:09.901 --> 00:16:11.061]  Why not have it come from Florida?
[00:16:12.542 --> 00:16:13.682]  It's almost all from China now.
[00:16:14.918 --> 00:16:15.679]  And what a joke!
[00:16:16.239 --> 00:16:23.584]  The Chinese fluoride has hundreds of other deadly chemicals in it, but under executive regulations, they allow it to be put in our water.
[00:16:23.684 --> 00:16:25.606]  I mean, who could make that up?
[00:16:25.966 --> 00:16:27.027]  You see, that's what I'm telling you, folks.
[00:16:27.427 --> 00:16:29.088]  It's so much worse than I can even tell you.
[00:16:30.049 --> 00:16:34.612]  It is, it is, it is... We are under globalist, high-tech, 21st century warfare.
[00:16:36.809 --> 00:16:37.610]  It's full spectrum.
[00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:38.491]  It's cultural.
[00:16:38.711 --> 00:16:39.392]  It's environmental.
[00:16:39.672 --> 00:16:40.293]  It's genetic.
[00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:41.334]  It's spiritual.
[00:16:41.635 --> 00:16:42.315]  It's economic.
[00:16:42.696 --> 00:16:43.797]  It is total.
[00:16:44.518 --> 00:16:49.323]  And you turn that television on, you've got talking heads that read off teleprompters and follow scripts.
[00:16:49.664 --> 00:16:51.526]  They don't even know what they're doing.
[00:16:53.047 --> 00:16:56.091]  Most of them don't even understand what they're involved in at this point.
[00:16:58.991 --> 00:17:09.555]  And then you've got Trump seen worldwide as the major peacemaker because he doesn't want to attack countries just for hegemonic global control that cost America money and that we get to blame for.
[00:17:09.575 --> 00:17:12.336]  If somebody starts a fight with us, fine.
[00:17:13.176 --> 00:17:18.598]  But you don't just go overthrow Russia so the neocons can go back in and rule and have their way with it.
[00:17:20.659 --> 00:17:22.440]  Trump wants prosperity.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.281]  He wants a renaissance economy, not a conquest economy.
[00:17:27.659 --> 00:17:30.820]  And that's why the whole power structure is having heart attacks.
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.380]  I mean, you've got the latest data dump 13.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.120]  I've got it right here.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:48.603]  That's like five or six of these Podesta drops have been simply about Russia, where now we know specifically he was working directly for the office of the President of Russia as a direct lobbyist.
[00:17:49.343 --> 00:17:50.683]  And hey, that's what governments do.
[00:17:51.903 --> 00:17:52.704]  But he should go to jail.
[00:17:54.444 --> 00:17:55.044]  So you notice
[00:17:56.854 --> 00:18:00.095]  You notice that everything they accuse Trump of is what they're doing.
[00:18:00.315 --> 00:18:01.256]  Oh, you're a Russian spy.
[00:18:01.436 --> 00:18:03.337]  Meanwhile, Hillary is in bed with them up to her eyeballs.
[00:18:05.138 --> 00:18:07.338]  And her chief of staff is an agent of Russia.
[00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:07.959]  Confirmed!
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.382]  But again, this is all just part of the double dealing and backstabbing system that Trump wants to try to resist.
[00:18:16.564 --> 00:18:17.605]  That's why they want him out of there.
[00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:25.871]  Meanwhile, they're trying to start a no-fly zone, that means shoot down Russian aircraft, then they'll tit for tat, they'll blow up one of our aircraft carriers, and then nuclear war starts.
[00:18:26.171 --> 00:18:26.612]  Guaranteed!
[00:18:27.512 --> 00:18:28.553]  All the top analysts agree.
[00:18:28.954 --> 00:18:29.814]  Never been in more danger.
[00:18:30.435 --> 00:18:36.499]  All because of Henry Kissinger and Hillary and Zbigniew Brzezinski running the Obama administration.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.521]  The whole world's in danger!
[00:18:38.601 --> 00:18:43.685]  You see, every day, the defense condition ticks towards midnight.
[00:18:45.765 --> 00:18:51.530]  And then they've got the nerve, all over TV, all over radio, for a month, to say Donald Trump's gonna start a nuclear war.
[00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.151]  Donald Trump's a Russian agent.
[00:18:54.272 --> 00:18:58.136]  How the hell, if he was a Russian agent, would he start a nuclear war when he's their agent?
[00:18:58.336 --> 00:19:00.177]  This is the biggest load of BS!
[00:19:00.458 --> 00:19:01.138]  And that's what's crazy!
[00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:02.760]  Logic has been suspended!
[00:19:05.322 --> 00:19:07.623]  Russia is floundering under massive sanctions.
[00:19:07.743 --> 00:19:08.983]  Russia just wants prosperity.
[00:19:09.183 --> 00:19:10.204]  That's why the globalists hate them.
[00:19:10.244 --> 00:19:11.204]  They're going free market.
[00:19:11.384 --> 00:19:12.484]  They're going Americana.
[00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:14.625]  They're trying to struggle to become what we were.
[00:19:15.265 --> 00:19:16.225]  They've already hit bottom.
[00:19:16.346 --> 00:19:18.286]  They're swimming back to the top for their lives.
[00:19:20.167 --> 00:19:21.527]  America isn't done swimming down.
[00:19:21.867 --> 00:19:27.029]  We want to see how dark and gross and ugly it can get before we turn around and try to get back to the top.
[00:19:28.857 --> 00:19:40.742]  And from France, to Spain, to Greece, to the United States, to everywhere, countries are seceding, people are pulling out of these global orders, and they're panicking, and that's why they're ready to push world government.
[00:19:40.943 --> 00:19:43.944]  Because they set up world government in the name of stopping future world wars.
[00:19:45.219 --> 00:19:48.961]  We're going to come back and we've just got the incredible hypocrisy yet again.
[00:19:49.861 --> 00:20:04.368]  We have Reuters, we have AP, I have CNN here in my stacks saying the Russians have hacked the election, oh my god it's total fraud, the election's in danger, but then schizophrenically saying Donald Trump's insane, there's never been any fraud, anyone that says there is is crazy.
[00:20:04.728 --> 00:20:05.849]  I have video of this!
[00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:20.629]  Hillary Clinton is desperate.
[00:20:21.569 --> 00:20:29.511]  Donald Trump was 10 points ahead in the polls until Reuters and others began sampling 10 to 15 percent more Democrats in their polls to skew the numbers.
[00:20:29.811 --> 00:20:30.371]  It's incredible.
[00:20:30.651 --> 00:20:39.853]  But despite all that skewing in the last two weeks, now in major polls, put up with the very same groups, with the same methodology, Trump is neck and neck with her, or even a point or two ahead.
[00:20:40.353 --> 00:20:45.774]  But if you go look at the social media, and Breitbart and Gateway Pundit have done this, it's incredible.
[00:20:46.494 --> 00:20:55.822]  We're talking 3, 4, 5, 6 times the support at places like Facebook, Livestream, Reddit, and so many other places.
[00:20:56.063 --> 00:20:59.946]  In fact, sometimes he's got 10 times more likes and 10 times more views.
[00:21:00.587 --> 00:21:04.370]  That's what we saw with Bernie Sanders, where he'd have 20,000 people, Hillary'd have 500.
[00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:09.254]  We did exit polls in California and other so-called battleground states in the Democratic primary.
[00:21:09.975 --> 00:21:13.796]  We talked to eight people before we found one or two Hillary supporters.
[00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:17.577]  That's why Hillary was forced to steal it with the superdelegates.
[00:21:18.257 --> 00:21:19.858]  Let's look at some of the numbers themselves.
[00:21:20.778 --> 00:21:25.659]  Trump had 10 million plus likes to Clinton's 5 million on Facebook.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:33.822]  And that's with Facebook admittedly censoring Trump pages everywhere they can and even meeting with Hillary Clinton just like Google does.
[00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:42.627]  Trump averages 30,000 live viewers per stream, and Clinton averages 500 live stream viewers per stream.
[00:21:43.067 --> 00:21:47.470]  On Reddit, Trump averages 197,000 plus subscribers, Hillary 24,000.
[00:21:47.931 --> 00:21:52.394]  Hillary for prison has 55,000 subscribers.
[00:21:52.654 --> 00:21:53.935]  Gee, wonder who started that.
[00:21:54.536 --> 00:21:58.538]  And this is only a snapshot of the numbers we're seeing with Trump.
[00:21:58.959 --> 00:22:02.501]  You go to YouTube, his average video has millions of views.
[00:22:03.542 --> 00:22:05.943]  You go look at Hillary's official campaign site.
[00:22:06.503 --> 00:22:08.423]  Most of her videos have 2,000 or 3,000 views.
[00:22:08.463 --> 00:22:09.923]  Her bigger one's a few hundred thousand.
[00:22:10.263 --> 00:22:11.424]  This lady's a joke.
[00:22:11.804 --> 00:22:13.164]  She's not liked by her own party.
[00:22:13.464 --> 00:22:20.125]  But we're being told it's going to be a landslide for her because they're trying to get us ready for election fraud.
[00:22:20.526 --> 00:22:23.646]  Something so well documented in this country's past.
[00:22:24.846 --> 00:22:26.887]  But Obama says it's preposterous.
[00:22:27.267 --> 00:22:29.167]  He doesn't even know what that is.
[00:22:29.947 --> 00:22:31.888]  Well, President Obama, we do know what it is.
[00:22:32.714 --> 00:22:38.596]  And this time, we don't have somebody like Mitt Romney or John McCain who's gonna stand down and not take action.
[00:22:38.896 --> 00:22:41.057]  We don't have somebody who's gonna throw in the towel there's fraud.
[00:22:41.317 --> 00:22:45.599]  We've got Donald Trump and an awake population that's aware of your scams.
[00:22:46.659 --> 00:22:48.320]  The social engineers have jumped the shark.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.741]  They are stealing this election in front of everyone.
[00:22:51.641 --> 00:22:55.443]  By forcing them to engage in fraud, we are exposing them forever.
[00:22:55.783 --> 00:23:00.425]  So even if Donald Trump loses, even if that happens due to fraud,
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:01.940]  Or scandals.
[00:23:02.321 --> 00:23:04.102]  It doesn't matter because we've been in the arena.
[00:23:04.302 --> 00:23:05.904]  We've politically exposed the system.
[00:23:06.144 --> 00:23:07.665]  Political correctness, globalism.
[00:23:08.085 --> 00:23:09.346]  The maxim has been introduced.
[00:23:09.687 --> 00:23:11.148]  Americanism, not globalism.
[00:23:11.949 --> 00:23:14.010]  This is a good time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:14.391 --> 00:23:20.455]  And we owe Donald Trump so much for being willing to put his family, his life, his treasure on the line.
[00:23:20.876 --> 00:23:22.117]  He is the man in the arena.
[00:23:22.697 --> 00:23:24.459]  And I'm honored to be in that arena with him as well.
[00:23:24.939 --> 00:23:29.523]  If you haven't joined us in this historic fight, it's time to pick a side right now.
[00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:41.709]  Our talk show host is Alex Jones.
[00:23:41.769 --> 00:23:43.650]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.450]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:47.470]  Alex Jones.
[00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.331]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:23:50.371 --> 00:23:53.591]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:23:53.611 --> 00:23:54.932]  Deeply I think racist.
[00:23:55.032 --> 00:23:56.872]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[00:23:56.972 --> 00:23:58.772]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[00:23:58.792 --> 00:24:02.873]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:24:02.893 --> 00:24:04.053]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:04.113 --> 00:24:09.034]  Watch the free stream live at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:24:36.457 --> 00:24:40.438]  What do you mean?
[00:24:40.498 --> 00:24:41.539]  That's nothing better to do.
[00:24:41.739 --> 00:24:43.859]  What do you mean they're an election fraud?
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.141]  That's all you Democrats bitch about.
[00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:55.583]  If there's a new way, I'll be the first in line.
[00:24:58.424 --> 00:24:59.544]  Monday through Friday.
[00:25:01.004 --> 00:25:01.604]  From 11 a.m.
[00:25:01.624 --> 00:25:02.145]  to 3 p.m.
[00:25:02.165 --> 00:25:02.505]  Central.
[00:25:02.525 --> 00:25:07.227]  By the way, we have Nigel Farage exclusive interview today with the man behind Brexit.
[00:25:07.707 --> 00:25:09.788]  A very serious warning for America.
[00:25:09.948 --> 00:25:10.748]  Very powerful.
[00:25:10.768 --> 00:25:14.670]  We've only aired like two minutes of the 25-minute report that we shot in Vegas.
[00:25:15.711 --> 00:25:18.232]  That's coming up in the fourth hour today with David Knight hosting.
[00:25:19.841 --> 00:25:26.244]  We also have a report that Rob Dew stayed up until five in the morning trying to finish, got exhausted, went home and is back.
[00:25:27.024 --> 00:25:30.005]  And I told him, I said, look, it's okay if it doesn't get done today, but he wants to finish it.
[00:25:30.485 --> 00:25:36.228]  It's extremely powerful and it just documents the huge history of election fraud in this country.
[00:25:36.508 --> 00:25:41.130]  The Democrats being the number one group complaining about it, even though they're the ones that mainly do it.
[00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:43.050]  Historically, they've been caught the most.
[00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:44.211]  Republicans do it too.
[00:25:44.671 --> 00:25:47.112]  But everybody knows the Democrats and big city machines.
[00:25:47.172 --> 00:25:49.793]  I mean, Chicago, Texas, you name it.
[00:25:49.813 --> 00:25:50.914]  Democrats used to run Texas.
[00:25:51.274 --> 00:25:51.934]  They are famous.
[00:25:51.954 --> 00:25:55.035]  I mean, Texas is probably worse than Illinois.
[00:25:55.055 --> 00:25:56.936]  I mean, nobody debates that who's serious-minded.
[00:25:58.416 --> 00:26:00.597]  It's so well historically chronicled.
[00:26:03.447 --> 00:26:29.566]  This report is going to be extremely powerful and we need to get it out to everybody who is in this mind control that Trump is a horrible person and hurting our quote democracy and trying to overthrow the election because he's saying look I will trust it if it's verified there isn't a bunch of fraud whether I win or lose if there isn't a bunch of fraud that I will accept it yes I'm saying though you've had a lot of other contested elections like 2000 and Al Gore contested that I may contest it if it looks like there's hanky-panky
[00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:33.753]  And let's face it, the Republicans probably did steal that from Al Gore.
[00:26:34.114 --> 00:26:35.816]  And I hate Al Gore, I'm just gonna be honest.
[00:26:36.617 --> 00:26:37.878]  But I was honest then!
[00:26:38.479 --> 00:26:40.982]  Go back to videos in 2000 and reports I put out.
[00:26:42.644 --> 00:26:44.407]  I haven't put a film out on the election.
[00:26:45.373 --> 00:26:53.379]  And we shed more fraud by Republicans than by Democrats, but both sides got caught doing it, and then the Supreme Court decided it.
[00:26:53.479 --> 00:27:00.965]  So, you can't have your cake and eat it too, and I keep harping on this because it goes to the heart of the death of common sense and the death of logic.
[00:27:01.565 --> 00:27:13.114]  You can't run around talking about fraud all day and say the Russians are taking over the election and it's the worst ever, and oh my God, Homeland Security's having to federalize things, and then have Obama go, there's no such thing as fraud, plus the Feds aren't involved.
[00:27:13.314 --> 00:27:14.315]  He said that again on Monday.
[00:27:15.063 --> 00:27:17.305]  With the Italian President visiting.
[00:27:17.905 --> 00:27:24.551]  It's just all... And then next, in the news, they cut his surrogate saying, oh my god, the election's in trouble, the Russians are taking it over.
[00:27:26.253 --> 00:27:27.293]  Here's Reuters today.
[00:27:28.274 --> 00:27:28.575]  U.S.
[00:27:29.716 --> 00:27:35.500]  vote authorities, I thought we didn't have federal vote authorities, warned to be alert to Russian hacks.
[00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:37.831]  And faking fraud.
[00:27:38.071 --> 00:27:39.391]  Oh, the new one!
[00:27:40.232 --> 00:27:43.253]  Anyone exposing election fraud is a Russian agent.
[00:27:43.854 --> 00:27:43.974]  Ah!
[00:27:45.114 --> 00:27:45.234]  Ah!
[00:27:46.035 --> 00:27:46.615]  I see.
[00:27:46.975 --> 00:27:53.799]  Homeland Security's federalizing it to keep them from hacking and to make sure that no one claims there was fraud by Homeland Security.
[00:27:54.219 --> 00:27:55.199]  Now I see.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:03.283]  Oh yes, they're definitely going to steal the election and then say that Trump's a Russian agent.
[00:28:03.523 --> 00:28:04.384]  Or if Trump, by some
[00:28:06.801 --> 00:28:09.102]  Link wins the election because there's such a landslide.
[00:28:09.502 --> 00:28:12.324]  They'll just say, oh, we're disqualifying it.
[00:28:12.444 --> 00:28:13.885]  The Russians stole it for Trump.
[00:28:14.205 --> 00:28:15.045]  It's so clear.
[00:28:15.386 --> 00:28:16.326]  It's so crazy.
[00:28:16.726 --> 00:28:20.828]  We are 17 days away right now from these lunatics trying this.
[00:28:22.249 --> 00:28:23.090]  Now here's Obama.
[00:28:25.071 --> 00:28:25.371]  You know what?
[00:28:25.391 --> 00:28:25.971]  We've got to go to break.
[00:28:25.991 --> 00:28:32.935]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to play Obama talking about how it's dangerous for Trump to talk about the election being in question.
[00:28:34.015 --> 00:28:34.896]  And then I've got Hillary.
[00:28:36.641 --> 00:28:42.146]  Saying, I'm concerned he hasn't condemned Russia's blatant effort to try to interfere in our elections.
[00:28:42.606 --> 00:28:48.872]  And then, Hillary going on to say, we are a country based on laws, we have fair elections, Trump blames someone else for his campaign.
[00:28:49.112 --> 00:28:52.114]  This was in the same little press conference after the debate, remember?
[00:28:54.556 --> 00:29:04.385]  I mean, she will say, there is no election fraud, there is no problem, the election's totally wonderful, go back to sleep, by the way, he won't condemn the Russians, they're trying to overtake the election.
[00:29:07.597 --> 00:29:11.963]  I mean, are they crazy or are their constituents crazy or both?
[00:29:12.243 --> 00:29:15.047]  Because this has reached beyond Twilight Zone level.
[00:29:16.008 --> 00:29:19.132]  Where they're like just sitting there beating themselves on the head with hammers or something.
[00:29:19.152 --> 00:29:21.535]  This is like lunatic asylum stuff at this point.
[00:29:22.358 --> 00:29:27.700]  And there's Trump, just completely normal, going, well, of course we've got a history of fraud and 4 million people that shouldn't be on the rolls.
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.361]  It's actually 21 million, but 4 million that we know are illegals and others.
[00:29:30.861 --> 00:29:31.921]  And so we should be watching.
[00:29:31.961 --> 00:29:34.242]  We got Pew Research saying the election's in question.
[00:29:34.482 --> 00:29:36.223]  We've got major problems with voting machines.
[00:29:36.523 --> 00:29:38.064]  And there's HBO documentaries about it.
[00:29:38.084 --> 00:29:39.044]  And everybody knows this.
[00:29:39.104 --> 00:29:42.725]  And there's been all these other contested elections, like 1960, 2000, you name it.
[00:29:43.165 --> 00:29:45.006]  And they already tried to steal the nomination from Trump.
[00:29:45.046 --> 00:29:46.126]  They did from Bernie Sanders.
[00:29:46.146 --> 00:29:47.247]  I mean, my God!
[00:29:48.007 --> 00:29:50.889]  They've been on TV saying your vote doesn't count in the primaries.
[00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:52.291]  On every channel.
[00:29:52.951 --> 00:29:55.633]  That now some secret cabal's gonna decide.
[00:29:55.914 --> 00:29:57.255]  These people are crazy!
[00:29:58.796 --> 00:29:59.717]  We're on the march.
[00:30:00.197 --> 00:30:01.799]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:02.739 --> 00:30:05.422]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.882 --> 00:30:11.142]  U.S.
[00:30:11.182 --> 00:30:19.329]  intelligence and law enforcement officials are again coming out and warning of Russian interference in the United States presidential election, but this time in a different tone.
[00:30:19.589 --> 00:30:30.778]  Now the intelligence agencies say Russian hackers will undermine the upcoming election by posting documents online reporting to show evidence that election fraud had happened and that Russia is hacking voter registration bases.
[00:30:31.238 --> 00:30:40.243]  They went on to say that the election is so large it is impossible for a hacker to change the outcome, so instead Russia will just resort to reporting election fraud online, fraudulently.
[00:30:40.603 --> 00:30:42.364]  State and local authorities have been warned.
[00:30:42.684 --> 00:30:53.869]  So wait a second, we have mass amounts of evidence of voter fraud piling up almost daily, we have US officials warning of Russian interference, but Obama has never heard of a rigged election, and Trump is crazy for monitoring the results.
[00:30:54.009 --> 00:30:59.152]  The truth is, they've been caught trying to rig the election, so they are distracting and diverting the blame to Russia.
[00:30:59.292 --> 00:31:03.895]  So now every time you see election fraud happening, it doesn't exist, and it's Russia's fault.
[00:31:03.935 --> 00:31:06.337]  This is Owen Troyer from InfoWars.com.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.863]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:31:13.943 --> 00:31:24.891]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:31:25.031 --> 00:31:29.952]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:31:30.072 --> 00:31:32.592]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:31:32.652 --> 00:31:34.153]  It helps detoxify.
[00:31:34.373 --> 00:31:37.193]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:31:37.253 --> 00:31:41.994]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:31:42.014 --> 00:31:48.255]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:31:48.275 --> 00:31:53.596]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:31:53.616 --> 00:31:54.356]  I'm taking it now.
[00:31:54.616 --> 00:31:55.116]  Every day.
[00:31:55.317 --> 00:31:56.057]  This is so key.
[00:31:56.297 --> 00:31:58.619]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.601]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:32:00.621 --> 00:32:02.723]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:32:02.863 --> 00:32:06.326]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.

[00:32:14.146 --> 00:32:16.329]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:32:16.449 --> 00:32:23.255]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:32:23.475 --> 00:32:26.759]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:27.940]  You're gonna crash afterwards.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.082]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:32:30.402 --> 00:32:34.625]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:32:34.866 --> 00:32:35.706]  This is sustainable.
[00:32:35.806 --> 00:32:39.789]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.172]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:32:43.232 --> 00:32:46.275]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:32:46.315 --> 00:32:47.796]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:32:47.836 --> 00:32:53.540]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:59.325]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call.
[00:32:59.605 --> 00:33:00.725]  888-253-3139.
[00:33:00.745 --> 00:33:06.967]  Get Brain Force at 25% off for a limited time at Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:07.287 --> 00:33:08.767]  And we thank you for your support.
[00:33:11.888 --> 00:33:19.629]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:24.827 --> 00:33:29.731]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today.
[00:33:32.414 --> 00:33:47.427]  I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept
[00:33:48.581 --> 00:33:54.863]  The results of this great and historic presidential election.
[00:33:56.523 --> 00:33:57.844]  If I win.
[00:33:57.864 --> 00:34:08.507]  The question of voter fraud came up during the debate.
[00:34:10.168 --> 00:34:13.209]  We want fairness in the election.
[00:34:14.749 --> 00:34:17.310]  This is having nothing to do with me.
[00:34:18.385 --> 00:34:22.388]  But having to do with the future of our country, we have to have fairness.
[00:34:24.549 --> 00:34:37.017]  John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, was quoted in WikiLeaks as saying, illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have their driver's license.
[00:34:42.904 --> 00:34:44.725]  What I'm saying is don't be naive, folks.
[00:34:44.805 --> 00:34:45.505]  Don't be naive.
[00:34:46.346 --> 00:34:50.008]  Of course, I would accept a clear election result.
[00:34:50.808 --> 00:34:59.973]  But I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.
[00:35:02.174 --> 00:35:02.334]  Right?
[00:35:09.324 --> 00:35:18.692]  And always, I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all of the many candidates who have come before me.
[00:35:18.972 --> 00:35:19.292]  Always.
[00:35:20.613 --> 00:35:21.574]  Bottom line, we're gonna win.
[00:35:21.974 --> 00:35:22.555]  We're gonna win.
[00:35:23.095 --> 00:35:24.036]  We're gonna win so big.
[00:35:24.676 --> 00:35:25.737]  We're gonna win so big.
[00:35:27.419 --> 00:35:34.785]  Now, that's what he had to say yesterday, but before I'd seen the video, I saw the New York Times headline that Donald Trump
[00:35:35.814 --> 00:35:39.337]  Promises to accept the results of the election if he wins.
[00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:41.939]  Being deceptive.
[00:35:43.301 --> 00:35:46.383]  Implying that he was saying, if I win, I'll accept it.
[00:35:46.443 --> 00:35:50.387]  No, he's saying, if there's not a bunch of fraud, and she wins, I'll accept it.
[00:35:50.487 --> 00:35:56.553]  But if there's a bunch of evidence of it, and a bunch of dead people voting, and all this other crap, everything else has been rigged, I'm gonna challenge it.
[00:35:57.113 --> 00:35:58.014]  Just like he fought.
[00:36:00.287 --> 00:36:16.953]  The Republicans, in the primary, said it's wrong when I win New Hampshire, and I win California, and I win all these other states, and Florida, that you sit there and say you're going to give the delegates to some made-up superdelegate and take it away.
[00:36:17.173 --> 00:36:18.093]  No, you're not going to do that.
[00:36:18.373 --> 00:36:19.214]  And they had to back off.
[00:36:20.854 --> 00:36:23.875]  But Trump didn't take my advice and go, with this he has common sense.
[00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:26.036]  But when I've talked to him, I've told him, keep it up.
[00:36:26.656 --> 00:36:27.597]  Expose the fraud.
[00:36:27.637 --> 00:36:28.577]  They're going to try to steal it.
[00:36:29.741 --> 00:36:35.066]  If you didn't fight with the Republican Party when they tried to take the nomination, you wouldn't have it.
[00:36:36.548 --> 00:36:37.389]  And Trump knows that.
[00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:47.419]  Sanders rolled over, folks, we need this guy as president because he did fight, and all the hell he's gone through, and all these hyenas coming at him from every stinking angle.
[00:36:53.251 --> 00:36:57.493]  But bigger than Trump, I'm worried about the average Democrat voter and just some of the trendies.
[00:36:58.333 --> 00:37:13.381]  Because how do you sit there with Reuters and AP and Hillary and Obama and all of them saying the Russians are trying to take over our election, it's never been so horrible, oh my god, and the latest thing is if you contest the election, you're a Russian agent too.
[00:37:14.881 --> 00:37:15.702]  They're going to try to quote
[00:37:16.738 --> 00:37:17.599]  Fake fraud.
[00:37:17.899 --> 00:37:23.705]  So see, if you see video of people going from polling place to polling place, that's the Russians that staged that, you see.
[00:37:24.426 --> 00:37:26.248]  No, Hillary would not steal anything.
[00:37:26.548 --> 00:37:28.250]  The Russians, they run everything.
[00:37:28.551 --> 00:37:30.673]  That's why parts of Russia are collapsing.
[00:37:34.778 --> 00:37:37.740]  Russia is in serious economic peril and can barely run in some country.
[00:37:38.001 --> 00:37:41.083]  But Russia is going to overthrow our election.
[00:37:41.243 --> 00:37:42.444]  Let me tell you who's overthrown our country.
[00:37:42.664 --> 00:37:50.830]  The Communist Chinese disrespect us so much that the President has to get off the back of the plane and then when his aides say, this is the President, where's the envoy?
[00:37:51.091 --> 00:37:51.851]  That's our country!
[00:37:51.871 --> 00:37:52.732]  You shut up, lady!
[00:37:52.752 --> 00:37:53.452]  You get out of here!
[00:37:53.633 --> 00:37:54.773]  Remember that video a month ago?
[00:37:55.854 --> 00:37:59.117]  The Philippine President goes to China, meets with the President,
[00:38:00.305 --> 00:38:02.186]  Has a huge military honor guard.
[00:38:02.226 --> 00:38:02.947]  We can pull it up.
[00:38:03.107 --> 00:38:05.549]  Just type President of Philippines goes to China.
[00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:07.390]  There he is with the President of China.
[00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:08.951]  With the big military parade.
[00:38:09.091 --> 00:38:10.072]  Full nine yards.
[00:38:11.232 --> 00:38:12.113]  Full nine yards.
[00:38:12.934 --> 00:38:15.475]  Goes to the meeting and says, I'm no longer with America.
[00:38:15.555 --> 00:38:16.296]  It's falling apart.
[00:38:16.576 --> 00:38:17.096]  It's a joke.
[00:38:17.177 --> 00:38:18.097]  Move into the Philippines.
[00:38:18.357 --> 00:38:19.538]  You want the South China Sea?
[00:38:19.578 --> 00:38:20.699]  We're inviting you in.
[00:38:21.459 --> 00:38:22.981]  The American military bases are yours.
[00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:25.342]  Unprecedented.
[00:38:26.623 --> 00:38:27.864]  This is today.
[00:38:28.224 --> 00:38:29.265]  This happened today.
[00:38:30.538 --> 00:38:31.498]  Fifteen hours ago.
[00:38:32.759 --> 00:38:34.080]  It'll be tomorrow, but they're soon.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.921]  This happened on the 21st of October.
[00:38:38.641 --> 00:38:41.383]  I don't care about the Philippines, that's our main coaling station in the Pacific.
[00:38:41.683 --> 00:38:45.965]  That's what the Japanese came in and took over in World War II, remember?
[00:38:46.685 --> 00:38:48.666]  That's absolutely key to control the whole region.
[00:38:49.186 --> 00:38:49.666]  Gone.
[00:38:50.367 --> 00:38:51.147]  We have leases.
[00:38:53.792 --> 00:38:55.273]  With rotating troops coming through.
[00:38:55.653 --> 00:38:57.014]  All that's being broken right now.
[00:38:57.654 --> 00:38:59.155]  This is what they brought us to.
[00:38:59.576 --> 00:39:05.659]  Russian fleet going into the Mediterranean to defend Syria from a globalist onslaught.
[00:39:09.842 --> 00:39:14.425]  Derivatives, Obamacare, all these scams, these crooks sit on top of.
[00:39:15.165 --> 00:39:15.666]  Unbelievable.
[00:39:16.146 --> 00:39:19.208]  Now, let's go ahead and go.
[00:39:21.598 --> 00:39:22.399]  To the next clip.
[00:39:22.439 --> 00:39:23.299]  Let's go to Obama.
[00:39:23.519 --> 00:39:24.940]  Says Trump dangerous.
[00:39:27.382 --> 00:39:28.643]  We're talking about rigged election.
[00:39:28.663 --> 00:39:31.264]  Meanwhile, the whole world wants Trump.
[00:39:31.825 --> 00:39:33.426]  They want to see America great again.
[00:39:33.446 --> 00:39:35.047]  They want to see us not be evil again.
[00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.451]  The United States breaks all its deals, steps.
[00:39:42.491 --> 00:39:44.733]  Everybody in the back has lost all its soft power.
[00:39:44.773 --> 00:39:45.713]  We used to be the good guys.
[00:39:45.753 --> 00:39:47.815]  We weren't perfect, but we were seen as the good guys.
[00:39:48.115 --> 00:39:48.955]  We're not now, folks.
[00:39:49.696 --> 00:39:51.097]  And everybody sees us as evil.
[00:39:53.595 --> 00:40:00.120]  That's because we've been set up and infiltrated and demoralized in a globalist plan to take all the power to China in the next phase.
[00:40:00.521 --> 00:40:03.263]  And they're going to take out Russia, and they're going to take out the United States.
[00:40:03.323 --> 00:40:04.804]  That's the New World Order double-cross.
[00:40:05.825 --> 00:40:07.106]  It's always been the double-cross.
[00:40:07.446 --> 00:40:08.467]  It's always been the plan.
[00:40:09.048 --> 00:40:17.595]  And they've set it up, and they're doing it, and they're using the poor Chinese people as the billion three hundred million leverage, because they're hard-working smart folks, to get that job done.
[00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:20.737]  And it's a serious situation.
[00:40:20.777 --> 00:40:21.218]  I talked to
[00:40:22.526 --> 00:40:26.408]  Special Forces people, Blackwater folks, billionaires.
[00:40:27.889 --> 00:40:45.919]  They say you go to China and like half the men are gone because they're all in Africa and they're all in Latin America and they're all military officers in plain clothes getting a Latin American wife, getting an African wife, and taking over the rare earth minerals, the farming, the roads, the infrastructure.
[00:40:46.099 --> 00:40:47.560]  It's Chinese colonialism.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.041]  Ten times what the British Empire ever did.
[00:40:50.241 --> 00:40:51.942]  They are taking over.
[00:40:54.724 --> 00:41:01.209]  This is a global government plan and the Chinese are the army ants that the globalists chose to get this job done.
[00:41:05.572 --> 00:41:08.033]  And I say army ant in a non-derogatory term.
[00:41:08.053 --> 00:41:13.677]  Have you ever seen army ants go through the jungle and just sweep everything and there's not anything left on a branch or a twig or the ground?
[00:41:15.879 --> 00:41:16.359]  Oh man!
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.441]  We're going to compete with the average factory with thousands of kids chained up.
[00:41:21.641 --> 00:41:22.782]  They chain the toddlers up.
[00:41:22.942 --> 00:41:25.343]  They get like one meal a day just sitting there with a chain.
[00:41:25.603 --> 00:41:26.984]  Chained to poles.
[00:41:27.224 --> 00:41:27.984]  That's their daycare.
[00:41:28.424 --> 00:41:29.184]  How do we compete with that?
[00:41:29.305 --> 00:41:30.485]  You don't compete with it.
[00:41:30.985 --> 00:41:32.186]  You lose your job.
[00:41:32.406 --> 00:41:33.506]  You become dependent.
[00:41:33.966 --> 00:41:34.687]  It's a plan.
[00:41:35.427 --> 00:41:39.289]  And Donald Trump, God bless him, wants to break that.
[00:41:39.389 --> 00:41:42.290]  It'll help the Chinese raise their standard, raise their
[00:41:43.379 --> 00:41:44.940]  Wages towards ours.
[00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:45.901]  You raise wages.
[00:41:45.941 --> 00:41:46.882]  You don't lower them.
[00:41:47.042 --> 00:41:48.344]  And then the left goes, well we are.
[00:41:48.524 --> 00:41:51.246]  We're going to have mandatory minimum wage.
[00:41:51.286 --> 00:41:52.788]  That just means you don't hire people.
[00:41:53.268 --> 00:42:02.296]  How do you compete and get mandatory $15 an hour wage, which I agree you do need to live on, bare minimum, when China it's like a dollar or less?
[00:42:04.338 --> 00:42:04.719]  You get it?
[00:42:04.779 --> 00:42:05.339]  It's global.
[00:42:05.359 --> 00:42:06.660]  They put us in a global system.
[00:42:06.841 --> 00:42:08.162]  Then they say we've got to have equality.
[00:42:10.128 --> 00:42:13.069]  But it's the opposite where we gotta pay for everybody to come here and have their babies for free.
[00:42:13.449 --> 00:42:16.410]  Did you know that it's not Mexicans that are the biggest group coming here now?
[00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:17.570]  It's Chinese women.
[00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.931]  Outnumber all Mexicans coming in now.
[00:42:20.071 --> 00:42:20.451]  Look it up.
[00:42:22.512 --> 00:42:23.892]  And it's the middle class and wealthy ones.
[00:42:23.912 --> 00:42:24.552]  They're not stupid.
[00:42:24.793 --> 00:42:27.153]  They come here and have their baby for free, which becomes a U.S.
[00:42:27.173 --> 00:42:27.573]  citizen.
[00:42:28.814 --> 00:42:29.174]  On the spot.
[00:42:30.663 --> 00:42:32.044]  And they get all the free goodies and everything else.
[00:42:32.064 --> 00:42:33.485]  And you go, but they're rich.
[00:42:33.726 --> 00:42:34.486]  They want more.
[00:42:34.907 --> 00:42:35.727]  They want more.
[00:42:36.028 --> 00:42:37.088]  Why not take advantage of it?
[00:42:37.469 --> 00:42:39.210]  There's leprosy spreading all over the country.
[00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:40.471]  TB spreading everywhere.
[00:42:40.671 --> 00:42:42.633]  Nobody had leprosy here just five years ago.
[00:42:42.973 --> 00:42:44.495]  The whole country's being shut down.
[00:42:44.675 --> 00:42:46.056]  We're under military attack.
[00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:47.557]  Understand that?
[00:42:47.817 --> 00:42:48.618]  Russia knows that.
[00:42:48.818 --> 00:42:50.099]  They've kicked the oligarchs out.
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:51.280]  Is Russia perfect?
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:51.601]  No.
[00:42:51.781 --> 00:42:52.982]  But they're standing up for their interests.
[00:42:55.390 --> 00:43:07.035]  And that witch has been on the Russian payroll, and everybody else's payroll, and so has Podesta, and they got the nerve to point at Donald Trump, who's lily-clean compared to them, and say he's a Russian agent.
[00:43:07.055 --> 00:43:08.236]  Okay, let me give you these clips.
[00:43:11.597 --> 00:43:14.358]  Here's Obama, Trump dangerous for talking about re-election.
[00:43:14.658 --> 00:43:22.322]  Now I just read to you Reuters, saying that the Russians are attacking the election, and the Feds are federalizing it,
[00:43:23.268 --> 00:43:28.051]  Or that anyone says there's election fraud by the Democrats is a Russian agent.
[00:43:28.312 --> 00:43:29.032]  That's the headline.
[00:43:30.213 --> 00:43:31.334]  Can't make that up.
[00:43:31.554 --> 00:43:33.675]  This confirms what they're going with.
[00:43:36.177 --> 00:43:38.479]  Reuters is even above AP when it comes to propaganda.
[00:43:38.499 --> 00:43:42.402]  Might as well be a teletype right out of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:43:43.683 --> 00:43:44.924]  You read this, you know exactly.
[00:43:44.944 --> 00:43:46.785]  I mean, this confirms it all.
[00:43:46.885 --> 00:43:47.105]  Right here.
[00:43:47.125 --> 00:43:47.766]  I got it.
[00:43:48.566 --> 00:43:49.487]  It's all over the news right now.
[00:43:50.581 --> 00:43:51.662]  Oh my God, the Russians are everywhere!
[00:43:51.822 --> 00:43:53.282]  Little green men, run for the hills!
[00:43:53.662 --> 00:43:56.043]  Meanwhile, there's no election fraud, though, when Donald Trump says it.
[00:43:59.285 --> 00:44:07.308]  That'd be like if you were standing by the Atlantic Ocean, at Coney Island, New York, and the President says, look at the beautiful ocean, and Trump says, yes, it's a beautiful ocean.
[00:44:07.608 --> 00:44:10.429]  You're insane, there's no ocean, but you just said there's an ocean two seconds ago.
[00:44:10.569 --> 00:44:10.870]  No, I didn't.
[00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:12.310]  Look at the beautiful ocean.
[00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:13.391]  You said it again.
[00:44:13.451 --> 00:44:13.751]  No, I didn't.
[00:44:14.131 --> 00:44:14.851]  Look at the beautiful ocean.
[00:44:15.271 --> 00:44:15.692]  You said it again.
[00:44:15.752 --> 00:44:16.032]  No, I didn't.
[00:44:16.312 --> 00:44:18.753]  I mean, it's a war on reality, people.
[00:44:20.674 --> 00:44:21.134]  Here's Obama.
[00:44:21.775 --> 00:44:23.136]  That is not a joking matter.
[00:44:23.836 --> 00:44:25.798]  No, no, no, I want everybody to pay attention here.
[00:44:26.138 --> 00:44:26.878]  That is dangerous.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:37.386]  Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's minds about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy.
[00:44:39.347 --> 00:44:44.671]  Then you're doing the work of our adversaries for them.
[00:44:46.072 --> 00:44:49.254]  Because our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters.
[00:44:52.762 --> 00:44:56.724]  Now, let's go ahead and go to Hillary in the same press conference.
[00:44:56.744 --> 00:44:57.964]  This is like a minute and a half before.
[00:44:57.984 --> 00:44:59.045]  I have the timecode right here.
[00:45:01.145 --> 00:45:03.706]  Hillary after debate, we are a country based on laws.
[00:45:03.746 --> 00:45:04.727]  We have fair elections.
[00:45:04.767 --> 00:45:06.928]  Trump blames someone else for his campaign.
[00:45:07.368 --> 00:45:15.991]  Then, a minute later, minute 19 later, I have the timecode, she comes back and says the Rooskies are trying to take over the election.
[00:45:16.452 --> 00:45:17.232]  Let's go to the first clip.
[00:45:18.997 --> 00:45:20.738]  I just wanted to come back and say hello.
[00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:23.180]  Some of you have been on the trail for the whole time.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:23.961]  No more debates.
[00:45:24.962 --> 00:45:25.722]  No more naps.
[00:45:26.603 --> 00:45:28.684]  Will you accept the results of the election?
[00:45:31.046 --> 00:45:35.469]  You know, it was horrifying what he said on the debate stage tonight.
[00:45:35.489 --> 00:45:38.251]  You know, our country's been around for 240 years and
[00:45:42.682 --> 00:45:46.104]  You know, we are a country based on laws.
[00:45:48.966 --> 00:45:54.209]  We've had hot, contested elections going back to the very beginning.
[00:45:54.229 --> 00:46:00.953]  But one of our hallmarks has always been that we accept the outcomes of our elections.
[00:46:01.013 --> 00:46:05.376]  We do the best we can to have fair elections, which we do.
[00:46:07.236 --> 00:46:09.097]  And somebody wins and somebody loses.
[00:46:10.097 --> 00:46:18.582]  So what he said tonight is part of his whole effort to blame somebody else for his campaign and for where he stands in this election.
[00:46:18.642 --> 00:46:35.872]  As I said, whenever he is losing, he says the system, whatever the system is, whether it's being in court about Trump University or losing the Iowa caucus in the Wisconsin primary or losing Emmys, for goodness sakes, he says that it's rigged against him.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.366]  No, he won the primary because he fought back.
[00:46:41.826 --> 00:46:43.049]  And he pointed out that he'd won.
[00:46:43.249 --> 00:46:46.896]  And that we're having voterless elections for Ted Cruz, lady.
[00:46:50.523 --> 00:46:52.624]  By the way, we don't edit those tapes and hear those glitches.
[00:46:53.104 --> 00:46:58.946]  When you download stuff from YouTube, it tends to have artifacts and glitches, and it just kind of pauses and buffers in the download for a minute.
[00:46:58.986 --> 00:47:00.826]  So that's why a lot of our videos have little hiccups.
[00:47:00.846 --> 00:47:03.087]  But you see that on other shows and radio shows as well.
[00:47:03.107 --> 00:47:04.667]  It's just what the Internet does.
[00:47:05.268 --> 00:47:07.188]  It's got a lot of great systems, but it also has problems.
[00:47:07.548 --> 00:47:13.050]  Now, she goes from saying it's ridiculous to say there's any problem with the election and the integrity, to going into the Russians and the election.
[00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:21.075]  How did you feel when he said, you know, nasty woman, nasty woman, and you're a puppet?
[00:47:21.916 --> 00:47:26.661]  The issue of Vladimir Putin, I just didn't pay any attention to that.
[00:47:27.162 --> 00:47:36.532]  I was very concerned that even now, after 17 intelligence agencies in our government, both military and civilian,
[00:47:37.132 --> 00:47:54.786]  have confirmed that Russia has engaged in cyber attacks against Americans, that he refused to admit that it's true and condemn it for what it is, which is a blatant effort to try to interfere in our elections.
[00:47:55.407 --> 00:48:00.270]  So the elections are totally safe when it comes to Democrats stealing, but Trump's with Putin.
[00:48:00.551 --> 00:48:02.993]  Now, Andrea Mitchell, right there from that angle, you can't see it.
[00:48:03.793 --> 00:48:11.680]  But a minute before, one of Hillary's campaign people hands her the phone with what the question is they want, which we have the emails and WikiLeaks behind the scenes.
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:12.521]  This goes on.
[00:48:12.561 --> 00:48:19.567]  They roll oranges at her and it's all scripted and a lot of times she's reading a teleprompter even during an interview with the interviewer in person.
[00:48:19.867 --> 00:48:21.649]  So it's all basically a theater.
[00:48:22.129 --> 00:48:23.210]  But we've caught it on video.
[00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:25.692]  DrudgeReport.com is linked to TheInfoWars.com.
[00:48:27.694 --> 00:48:29.054]  Video and article about it.
[00:48:29.415 --> 00:48:32.235]  Obviously, radio listeners can't see this, but I'll describe it for you.
[00:48:32.755 --> 00:48:33.916]  Let's go ahead and roll that video.
[00:48:35.656 --> 00:48:37.497]  Of- The whole time, no more debates?
[00:48:38.497 --> 00:48:39.257]  No more naps?
[00:48:40.137 --> 00:48:52.521]  What do you expect the- What do you- Secretary Clinton- What do you do when he said, you know, nasty woman, nasty woman, and you're a puppet and-
[00:48:53.609 --> 00:48:57.614]  I just didn't pay any attention.
[00:48:58.816 --> 00:49:04.423]  Yeah, it's the press secretary handing the phone to Mitchell to ask the next question, nasty woman.
[00:49:04.443 --> 00:49:06.466]  They want to get that nasty woman thing out.
[00:49:06.646 --> 00:49:10.972]  So you literally have Hillary's people directing CNN in front of everyone.
[00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:16.730]  And he's saying, I've got a question.
[00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:19.611]  Signaling, just like in the first debate, she was signaling.
[00:49:19.851 --> 00:49:20.752]  There they are signaling.
[00:49:21.052 --> 00:49:25.334]  This is an organized military attack by foreign globalists.
[00:49:25.494 --> 00:49:27.155]  Corporate mercenaries are doing this.
[00:49:28.576 --> 00:49:29.076]  Incredible.
[00:49:29.616 --> 00:49:30.317]  But here's Reuters.
[00:49:31.909 --> 00:49:34.271]  I mean, I've had people on the street go, Alex, what do you think about Trump?
[00:49:34.351 --> 00:49:37.913]  You know, he must be losing if he's saying the election's gonna be stolen.
[00:49:37.953 --> 00:49:39.114]  And I go, do you remember Al Gore?
[00:49:39.134 --> 00:49:42.156]  Do you remember all the documentaries about this on HBO?
[00:49:42.376 --> 00:49:44.238]  Do you know about the 1960 election?
[00:49:44.458 --> 00:49:46.779]  Do you know they tried to steal the nomination from him and did from Bernie?
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.380]  And they go, oh yeah, I guess you're right.
[00:49:48.621 --> 00:49:49.821]  Yeah, he has to fight!
[00:49:51.042 --> 00:49:51.563]  Do you understand?
[00:49:51.603 --> 00:49:53.364]  They're saying the Russians are taking over.
[00:49:54.465 --> 00:49:55.065]  The Russians!
[00:49:55.966 --> 00:49:57.187]  So you can't have it both ways.
[00:49:58.337 --> 00:49:58.617]  U.S.
[00:49:58.697 --> 00:50:03.862]  Vote authorities warn to be alert to Russian hacks, Reuters, and faking fraud.
[00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:04.422]  Oh, yes.
[00:50:05.543 --> 00:50:08.666]  They're scared their election fraud is going to get caught, so it must be Russians.
[00:50:09.266 --> 00:50:09.547]  U.S.
[00:50:09.587 --> 00:50:26.181]  intelligence and law enforcement officials, the same ones that protect Hillary and won't indict her, are warning that hackers with ties to Russia's intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud.
[00:50:27.133 --> 00:50:32.618]  So see, if anybody posts an article or a video showing it, or maybe even Wikileaks, why don't listen?
[00:50:32.658 --> 00:50:33.338]  That's the Russians.
[00:50:33.679 --> 00:50:36.781]  The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, of course, said, however, the U.S.
[00:50:36.821 --> 00:50:42.807]  election system is so large, diffuse, and antiquated, that hackers could not be able to change the outcome of the November 8 election.
[00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:46.009]  But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified.
[00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.872]  That means they're going to do it to then say all of its lies.
[00:50:49.132 --> 00:50:50.133]  Poison the well tactic.
[00:50:50.553 --> 00:50:53.596]  We're going to come back and then out of the gates.
[00:50:53.616 --> 00:51:00.182]  I'm going to play a clip from the Catholic dinner roast last night where Trump points out who the real allies are of Hillary.
[00:51:00.242 --> 00:51:01.042]  They're in the audience.
[00:51:01.383 --> 00:51:04.345]  And then we will continue on with a bunch of big guests today.
[00:51:04.765 --> 00:51:05.566]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:05.706 --> 00:51:06.227]  Stay with us.
[00:51:09.685 --> 00:51:11.106]  I said to Donald, here's what they're doing.
[00:51:11.126 --> 00:51:12.428]  They're setting it up as follows.
[00:51:13.048 --> 00:51:16.211]  For three, four months they've been saying the Russians are hacking our elections.
[00:51:16.251 --> 00:51:21.016]  They're saying to protect our elections, which are sacred, we want to turn it over to DHS.
[00:51:21.036 --> 00:51:24.940]  The genius has given us one terrorist attack after another and has done nothing to stop it.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.981]  He still has his job, right?
[00:51:26.521 --> 00:51:28.963]  So he wants to now make sure our elections are safe.
[00:51:29.284 --> 00:51:30.104]  Russians are hacking.
[00:51:30.825 --> 00:51:31.925]  Follow the bouncing ball.
[00:51:31.945 --> 00:51:32.566]  No proof.
[00:51:32.946 --> 00:51:51.011]  If Trump wins, which is highly likely by the way, which we can talk about in a minute or two or another time, Trump wins, government declares, oh we have evidence that the Russians hacked it, he's a friend of Putin, the election is null and void, we're going to recall another election in what, six months?
[00:51:51.071 --> 00:51:54.132]  Until then, Mr. Obama has graciously agreed
[00:51:55.092 --> 00:51:58.394]  To continue his public service in the United States of America.
[00:51:58.714 --> 00:51:59.515]  Thank you very much.
[00:51:59.575 --> 00:52:00.696]  We're not taking any questions.
[00:52:00.736 --> 00:52:01.196]  Goodbye.
[00:52:03.277 --> 00:52:12.003]  And we have Biden announcing they're going to launch a giant cyber attack on the Russians and saying if the Russians respond, they may respond militarily, which is a doctrine Hillary came out with two months ago.
[00:52:12.383 --> 00:52:14.665]  And suddenly NATO announced that's their new doctrine.
[00:52:14.905 --> 00:52:16.366]  She's literally calling the show.
[00:52:17.717 --> 00:52:20.579]  All I wanted to say was, I said it to Donald and he didn't take the bait.
[00:52:20.599 --> 00:52:21.199]  I'm glad he didn't.
[00:52:21.259 --> 00:52:24.662]  I said, don't even answer me because they'll crucify you if you agree with me.
[00:52:25.643 --> 00:52:27.364]  They're going to steal the election.
[00:52:27.544 --> 00:52:28.304]  I'll make it simple.
[00:52:28.364 --> 00:52:31.106]  In the fifth grade, I ran for class president in Queens, New York.
[00:52:32.107 --> 00:52:33.048]  I was a funny kid.
[00:52:33.108 --> 00:52:33.948]  I was a wild kid.
[00:52:33.968 --> 00:52:34.729]  I was out of control.
[00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:36.330]  I won the election by a landslide.
[00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:40.733]  The teacher stood up and said, this election doesn't count.
[00:52:41.053 --> 00:52:44.256]  And she had another election, and I wasn't class president.
[00:52:44.676 --> 00:52:49.380]  So, hey, look, if it could be done in the fifth grade in the Bronx when I was a kid, why can't they do it to us now, right?
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:50.080]  We're just children.
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:51.701]  I had a similar thing happen.
[00:52:51.721 --> 00:52:58.487]  You know, when you really do things in this world, you start to learn how rigged they are, and it's just crazy to see them go, even though it's the same newscast.
[00:52:59.207 --> 00:53:00.528]  The Russians are rigging the election.
[00:53:00.848 --> 00:53:02.789]  We're having to bring in the UN to oversee it.
[00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:04.209]  And then meanwhile, Trump's crazy.
[00:53:04.469 --> 00:53:07.931]  He says they're rigging the election, even as we catch election officials admitting the fraud.
[00:53:08.131 --> 00:53:09.451]  We do have a minute or two more if you've got it.
[00:53:09.971 --> 00:53:11.012]  Elaborate on what you're saying.
[00:53:11.032 --> 00:53:11.672]  I mean, I agree.
[00:53:11.692 --> 00:53:14.953]  The internal polls, I know from Trump, but also other big groups are doing internal polls.
[00:53:15.474 --> 00:53:17.575]  5, 10, 15 points ahead in most battleground states.
[00:53:17.875 --> 00:53:19.115]  He's going to win in a landslide.
[00:53:19.375 --> 00:53:23.057]  They're only creating the perception he's way behind, so we buy it right now.
[00:53:23.077 --> 00:53:23.937]  Do you concur with that?
[00:53:24.097 --> 00:53:25.718]  A. B. What happens when he gets in?
[00:53:26.299 --> 00:53:26.821]  100% right.
[00:53:26.841 --> 00:53:27.966]  You and I think the same way.
[00:53:28.026 --> 00:53:30.154]  I said to Donald yesterday on my radio show, I said...
[00:53:31.869 --> 00:53:32.349]  Uh, Donald.
[00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:37.033]  I said, what they're doing is they're not trying to get Hillary people to vote for Hillary.
[00:53:37.073 --> 00:53:39.015]  They've got all the people they could ever, ever get.
[00:53:39.035 --> 00:53:45.199]  I said, what they're trying to do is discourage Trump voters from voting by thinking that it's, it's over already.
[00:53:45.239 --> 00:53:47.841]  They're trying to make them think that he lost, that she won.
[00:53:47.861 --> 00:53:50.083]  So they're going to throw their hands up and not vote for him.
[00:53:50.383 --> 00:53:53.886]  He's got to make sure that people think he can still win, which he can.
[00:53:54.807 --> 00:53:59.650]  And then if all of us who are supporting him come out, I think he will win.
[00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:00.551]  It's that simple.
[00:54:00.711 --> 00:54:02.274]  That's right, you can't steal landslides.
[00:54:02.314 --> 00:54:07.243]  I've interviewed experts who are Democrats, Republicans, die-bold engineers from the highest levels, they agree.
[00:54:07.924 --> 00:54:09.567]  You cannot steal a landslide.
[00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:15.491]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:54:16.011 --> 00:54:19.072]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:19.172 --> 00:54:22.773]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:23.173 --> 00:54:27.255]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:54:27.795 --> 00:54:33.617]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[00:54:33.697 --> 00:54:39.699]  These events give not only the candidates a chance to be with each other,
[00:54:40.686 --> 00:54:47.307]  In a very social setting, it also allows the candidates the opportunity to meet the other candidates' team.
[00:54:48.468 --> 00:54:48.968]  Good team.
[00:54:49.868 --> 00:54:59.870]  I know Hillary met my campaign manager, and I got the chance to meet the people who are working so hard to get her elected.
[00:55:02.591 --> 00:55:03.331]  There they are.
[00:55:04.771 --> 00:55:05.971]  The heads of NBC, CNN,
[00:55:09.488 --> 00:55:15.313]  CBS, ABC, there's the New York Times right over there, and the Washington Post.
[00:55:16.573 --> 00:55:17.794]  They're working overtime.
[00:55:18.375 --> 00:55:20.116]  True, true.
[00:55:26.041 --> 00:55:27.642]  No, this one's gonna get me in trouble.
[00:55:29.684 --> 00:55:30.464]  Not with Hillary.
[00:55:32.185 --> 00:55:38.791]  You know, the president told me to stop whining, but I really have to say the media
[00:55:39.835 --> 00:55:42.136]  Is even more biased this year than ever before.
[00:55:42.617 --> 00:55:42.817]  Ever.
[00:55:44.978 --> 00:55:45.819]  You want the proof?
[00:55:46.699 --> 00:55:53.183]  Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it.
[00:55:53.243 --> 00:55:54.164]  It's fantastic.
[00:55:55.004 --> 00:55:57.125]  They think she's absolutely great.
[00:55:58.406 --> 00:56:03.289]  My wife Melania gives the exact same speech.
[00:56:06.371 --> 00:56:09.153]  And people get on her case.
[00:56:11.866 --> 00:56:13.749]  And I don't get it.
[00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:16.192]  I don't know why.
[00:56:16.212 --> 00:56:19.116]  You know, the globalist.
[00:56:20.037 --> 00:56:21.239]  And it wasn't her fault.
[00:56:21.519 --> 00:56:22.661]  Stand up, Melania.
[00:56:22.721 --> 00:56:23.121]  Come on.
[00:56:24.003 --> 00:56:25.605]  She took a lot of abuse.
[00:56:28.677 --> 00:56:29.718]  We should have done that during the debate.
[00:56:30.518 --> 00:56:31.879]  You know, Trump is so real.
[00:56:32.019 --> 00:56:33.120]  Trump is so genuine.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.221]  He's so Americana.
[00:56:34.261 --> 00:56:46.930]  He's the opposite of these creepy groups of globalists that get together in these big boardrooms and then fence all their corruption through other agencies so they hide who's behind all the different, you know, globalist operations.
[00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:48.671]  It's truly disgusting.
[00:56:49.191 --> 00:56:53.815]  And then here comes somebody who, again, just isn't out to get America.
[00:56:55.996 --> 00:57:06.612]  And they're just panicking and the whole world and all the special interests and the Chinese Communist President and all these people say you can't have Donald Trump if Americans don't elect him in a giant mega landslide.
[00:57:09.316 --> 00:57:11.379]  Then it's a referendum on the fact that we want to be slaves.
[00:57:12.503 --> 00:57:13.904]  I mean, Trump could be bad.
[00:57:14.444 --> 00:57:19.226]  And if the Communist Chinese or the Saudi Arabians are telling me what to do, I'd vote for him.
[00:57:19.386 --> 00:57:20.446]  But he's wonderful!
[00:57:21.087 --> 00:57:21.987]  That's what the Russians know.
[00:57:22.027 --> 00:57:23.508]  He's gonna be strong, he's gonna be serious.
[00:57:23.708 --> 00:57:24.688]  He's not out to get them, though.
[00:57:24.868 --> 00:57:26.689]  They're just like, please, please give us Trump.
[00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:30.011]  We don't even know him, but, you know, we don't want war.
[00:57:30.031 --> 00:57:32.932]  We want to have organic trade with you.
[00:57:32.952 --> 00:57:34.933]  You know, we want to have kids.
[00:57:35.553 --> 00:57:36.434]  We want to go to space.
[00:57:37.274 --> 00:57:39.375]  But see, America is run by a culture of death.
[00:57:40.350 --> 00:57:41.271]  We're run by the New World Order.
[00:57:41.831 --> 00:57:43.293]  I need to fund this operation, folks.
[00:57:43.433 --> 00:57:51.259]  I have made inroads into fighting the globalists with very, very small amounts of funding.
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:54.943]  But these are products you really need, but I don't have time to belabor it all.
[00:57:55.123 --> 00:57:55.923]  People need to go get
[00:57:56.707 --> 00:58:13.393]  Biotrube, Selenium, they need to go get the 25% off, the Nootropic Rainforest, you need to get on X2, Oxy Powder, flushing your guts out, the Vitamineral Fusion for your kids especially, the Fruit Punch, it's all there and it's really great products.
[00:58:13.413 --> 00:58:16.794]  Look how good our information is, look how aggressive we are, look how we dominate news.
[00:58:16.814 --> 00:58:18.654]  Well imagine the products we come up with.
[00:58:18.674 --> 00:58:20.115]  I mean, it's the very best.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.161]  Infowarslives.com is where you find the supplements.
[00:58:24.241 --> 00:58:25.802]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:58:26.042 --> 00:58:29.364]  We have Hillary for President limited edition shirts that when they're gone, they're gone forever.
[00:58:29.424 --> 00:58:30.505]  No new editions, no nothing.
[00:58:31.025 --> 00:58:32.446]  It's over.
[00:58:32.466 --> 00:58:36.688]  $9.95, that's five bucks for the shirt, five bucks is what the shipping cost, so that's shipping included, $9.95.
[00:58:36.788 --> 00:58:41.411]  And we've got the new Trump is my President shirt that's red to wear out there on election day.
[00:58:41.431 --> 00:58:45.032]  We've got the Bill Clinton rape shirt, all of it, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:45.353 --> 00:58:47.394]  And we need to be refueled and funded.
[00:58:47.634 --> 00:58:48.614]  Thank you for your support.
[00:58:48.654 --> 00:58:49.115]  We'll be back.
[00:58:49.355 --> 00:58:51.136]  But we'll always be committed and never back down.
[00:58:51.776 --> 00:58:54.543]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:54.604 --> 00:58:56.809]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.403 --> 00:59:00.683]  We're red on election day.
[00:59:00.823 --> 00:59:03.784]  Perhaps the biggest election in American history is just days away.
[00:59:03.944 --> 00:59:08.526]  We know that in past elections, there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election fraud.
[00:59:08.566 --> 00:59:15.788]  From dead people voting, to people registering false identifications, to government leaders providing fast-track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes.
[00:59:15.968 --> 00:59:17.429]  This is happening right in front of us.
[00:59:17.649 --> 00:59:22.050]  Now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.
[00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:24.012]  Government shills are campaigning for Clinton.
[00:59:24.112 --> 00:59:27.295]  Mainstream news attacking Donald Trump all day like rabbit hounds.
[00:59:27.476 --> 00:59:34.222]  Rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting Trump.
[00:59:34.363 --> 00:59:36.905]  Fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms.
[00:59:37.145 --> 00:59:40.349]  So with all this, what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen?
[00:59:40.609 --> 00:59:42.431]  What can we do to prevent election fraud?
[00:59:42.611 --> 00:59:45.713]  I propose that all Donald Trump supporters wear red on Election Day.
[00:59:45.833 --> 00:59:49.595]  On November 8th, when you head to the polls to vote Donald Trump, be decked out in red.
[00:59:49.676 --> 00:59:55.739]  This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout, we can prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout.
[00:59:55.819 --> 00:59:58.761]  Wear red on Election Day, and make America great again!
[01:00:01.563 --> 01:00:04.145]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:24.012 --> 01:00:28.168]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:32.884 --> 01:00:46.832]  Anonymous has announced that a video secretly recorded by Israeli intelligence showing former President Bill Clinton raping a 13-year-old girl on billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's Orgy Island will be released.
[01:00:47.273 --> 01:00:57.459]  An island that Bill Clinton visited at least 26 times according to flight logs and had left his Secret Service detail behind on at least five occasions.
[01:00:57.859 --> 01:01:13.993]  You would think that this possible unveiling of pure evil would cause the earth to stand still, but the mainstream media remains silent while continuing to promote globalist candidate Hillary Clinton and her Roman-style divide-and-rule agenda.
[01:01:14.213 --> 01:01:18.217]  Instead, the propaganda machine is doubling down on its brainwashing.
[01:01:18.457 --> 01:01:26.203]  As Clifford Cunningham reports, an upcoming episode of Law & Order SVU will feature a Donald Trump-like character accused of rape.
[01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:36.951]  Actor Gary Cole will portray a wealthy and boorish man who makes a run for the White House on an upcoming SVU episode entitled Unstoppable, according to Variety.
[01:01:37.132 --> 01:01:45.338]  The plot of the episode will be based on a dubious civil lawsuit filed against Donald Trump by a woman, referred to as Jane Doe in court documents,
[01:01:45.618 --> 01:01:50.361]  Who alleges Trump raped her when she was 13 years old in the mid-1990s.
[01:01:50.521 --> 01:01:57.905]  The lawsuit presided over by a judge appointed by Obama is scheduled for a hearing in December after the presidential election.
[01:01:58.045 --> 01:02:13.073]  The decision to depict the character identical to Donald Trump accused of raping women is a concerted ploy to manipulate the people who watch the episode into conflating a fictitious story with reality and conclude Trump is actually a rapist.
[01:02:13.453 --> 01:02:17.276]  Meanwhile, the mainstream media continues to portray Trump as a rapist.
[01:02:17.556 --> 01:02:21.739]  They continually cover up any mention of the true abuser of women, Bill Clinton.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.041]  Is America really this stupid?
[01:02:24.281 --> 01:02:26.523]  Maybe 10 years ago, but today?
[01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:33.888]  Well, Major, I want to start with a short video clip from 1992 from Entertainment Tonight, which is owned by CBS Television.
[01:02:34.329 --> 01:02:38.672]  In it, Donald Trump is heard making questionable comments about a young girl.
[01:02:38.712 --> 01:02:39.433]  Let's listen to that.
[01:02:42.014 --> 01:02:42.674]  Thursday night.
[01:02:42.874 --> 01:02:44.175]  You're going up the escalator?
[01:02:44.275 --> 01:02:44.575]  Yeah.
[01:02:44.875 --> 01:02:45.975]  I'm gonna be dating her in 10 years.
[01:02:46.015 --> 01:02:46.795]  Can you believe it?
[01:02:48.876 --> 01:02:50.416]  And the breaking news at this hour.
[01:02:50.576 --> 01:02:56.938]  Right now, just breaking, a damning report from the New York Times that claims Donald Trump inappropriately touched two women.
[01:02:57.118 --> 01:02:59.338]  The first nearly three decades ago, the second in 2005.
[01:02:59.558 --> 01:03:01.599]  He was like an octopus.
[01:03:01.639 --> 01:03:02.939]  It was like he had six arms.
[01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:04.559]  He was all over the place.
[01:03:04.879 --> 01:03:11.281]  If he had stuck with the upper part of the body, I might not have gotten
[01:03:13.465 --> 01:03:17.527]  I might not have gotten that upset, but it's when he started putting his hand up my skirt.
[01:03:18.448 --> 01:03:23.190]  And how directly then is he going to start deflecting all of this to Bill Clinton?
[01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:28.233]  We've heard from Jim Acosta that they're going to start making charges about Bill Clinton.
[01:03:28.333 --> 01:03:30.174]  One would presume also Hillary Clinton.
[01:03:30.514 --> 01:03:34.536]  I presume he's going to talk about WikiLeaks and John Podesta's emails.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:42.261]  You know it, they know it, I know it, and pretty much the whole world knows it.
[01:03:42.981 --> 01:03:52.403]  The establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are very well known.
[01:03:53.343 --> 01:04:01.545]  Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe, and morally deformed.
[01:04:02.898 --> 01:04:05.639]  They will do whatever is necessary.
[01:04:05.999 --> 01:04:07.880]  The Clintons are criminals.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.561]  Remember that.
[01:04:08.661 --> 01:04:09.421]  They're criminals.
[01:04:12.563 --> 01:04:14.143]  This is well documented.
[01:04:14.804 --> 01:04:30.291]  And the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power.
[01:04:34.631 --> 01:04:39.776]  Never in history have we seen such a cover-up as this.
[01:04:40.397 --> 01:04:48.866]  Mainstream media as we know it with a democratic operative agenda so foolish they don't even realize they no longer control the narrative.
[01:04:49.146 --> 01:04:51.088]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[01:05:10.151 --> 01:05:11.332]  Hi, my name is Danny Williams.
[01:05:11.632 --> 01:05:12.173]  I'm here today.
[01:05:12.193 --> 01:05:19.418]  This is my first time on television today to talk to Alex Jones, to prove to the world the truth about me being President Clinton's son.
[01:05:19.678 --> 01:05:22.260]  I always wanted to know, I just never got any help.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.162]  I reached out to lawyers and investigators.
[01:05:25.202 --> 01:05:26.903]  They would not look into my case.
[01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:31.407]  My mom receives $700 and $100 bills in her mailbox every month.
[01:05:32.723 --> 01:05:44.192]  And the Christmas presents, you know, he get out with his police state trooper outfit on and I see him leave and I can read the text and say, you know, state government, you know, at the time we was kids.
[01:05:44.652 --> 01:05:48.195]  So we didn't too much, you know, we went off straight to playing with the toys.
[01:05:48.755 --> 01:05:51.638]  But over the years, you know, I just think about that.
[01:05:51.758 --> 01:05:53.439]  I just I just go back into that day.
[01:05:53.679 --> 01:05:54.920]  Everybody in Arkansas at the time,
[01:05:57.208 --> 01:05:59.650]  I was coming up, knew about me being a son.
[01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:01.030]  Preachers and all.
[01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:03.392]  First I learned, I was probably about eight or nine.
[01:06:03.992 --> 01:06:10.056]  I was in school, and you know, my teachers, they would look at me, and like, they'd be whispering, you know, it's Bill Clinton's son.
[01:06:10.696 --> 01:06:13.778]  His mother's the one that claims she had a baby by Bill Clinton.
[01:06:13.838 --> 01:06:16.119]  She took me down to the governor's mansion.
[01:06:16.299 --> 01:06:17.460]  She had to sneak through the gates.
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:21.622]  And she went up to the door, and the butler answered the door.
[01:06:22.563 --> 01:06:24.484]  And she asked for Hillary.
[01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:35.915]  And the door was slammed in her face, but we was told to get off the property, so she took off running, snatched me by one arm, and all I can remember is my arm hurting, and she snatched me to jump over the fence.
[01:06:35.935 --> 01:06:38.156]  I think Hillary is the one that kept me away.
[01:06:38.916 --> 01:06:50.001]  They still put out false reports, 1999, 2000, the false DNA, you know, all these articles that they put out that's false about me, and I think it was put out to discredit my story.
[01:06:50.914 --> 01:07:05.821]  For her, I have thought about suicide before in my teens and going through, you know, as far as house to house, clothes not clean, you know, on the streets, just, you know, living the way bums live, you know, and it just was hurtful.
[01:07:07.002 --> 01:07:07.302]  And then
[01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:10.719]  I just had to pull myself out of that, you know.
[01:07:10.839 --> 01:07:12.500]  I've been taking care of me and my kids.
[01:07:13.061 --> 01:07:14.021]  I'm not asking for money.
[01:07:14.281 --> 01:07:16.583]  I'm asking for a simple acknowledgement and a DNA.
[01:07:16.904 --> 01:07:17.584]  It's been nice.
[01:07:17.644 --> 01:07:21.287]  I went to bed hungry, balled up, starving.
[01:07:21.427 --> 01:07:26.331]  Because I had to make sure my baby brother and sister eat and went without eating.
[01:07:26.611 --> 01:07:27.512]  I don't work for Trump.
[01:07:27.652 --> 01:07:28.473]  I work for myself.
[01:07:28.513 --> 01:07:31.455]  I've done this two years ago before she even started running.
[01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:33.257]  So, I believe in my heart.
[01:07:33.297 --> 01:07:34.358]  He knows I'm his son.
[01:07:35.058 --> 01:07:38.601]  And I know I'm his son because I see it.
[01:07:39.242 --> 01:07:40.603]  All I want is the truth out.
[01:07:41.043 --> 01:07:42.384]  That's all I'm reaching for, the truth.
[01:07:42.424 --> 01:07:43.906]  There's not no political scandal.
[01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:53.293]  I would like to just ask Hillary to please not get in the way of me taking this chance and asking my father for a DNA sample.
[01:07:53.313 --> 01:07:57.737]  So in the words of Ludacris, move out the way.
[01:07:57.937 --> 01:07:58.258]  Move.
[01:07:58.738 --> 01:08:01.921]  I'm Danny Williams, the son of Bill Clinton.
[01:08:02.913 --> 01:08:07.675]  I'm here today to get the truth out about me and who I am.
[01:08:07.876 --> 01:08:09.556]  Yes, I want to dress you as my dad.
[01:08:21.523 --> 01:08:26.165]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:32.739 --> 01:08:34.000]  Guess what's in the new WikiLeaks?
[01:08:34.781 --> 01:08:38.625]  It's not just Chelsea saying we're committing crimes and being told, shut up, quit being a brat.
[01:08:39.626 --> 01:08:42.528]  Or Chelsea begging, hey, we're killing Haitians, aren't we going to give them any money?
[01:08:43.589 --> 01:08:44.310]  Shut up, brat.
[01:08:44.951 --> 01:08:48.274]  Now it's top aide blasted Bill Clinton for conflicts of interest.
[01:08:48.654 --> 01:08:50.636]  That's linked on DrudgeReport.com, top story.
[01:08:51.677 --> 01:08:52.778]  He said he could add 500 examples.
[01:08:55.247 --> 01:08:57.169]  Well, more than that, it's all illegal.
[01:08:57.209 --> 01:08:58.350]  But they're too big to fail.
[01:08:58.590 --> 01:08:59.771]  Because they run the Justice Department.
[01:09:00.152 --> 01:09:00.392]  UMA.
[01:09:00.732 --> 01:09:02.314]  Hillary created this mess.
[01:09:02.394 --> 01:09:03.755]  It's all in the emails.
[01:09:03.895 --> 01:09:06.278]  Because Hillary, folks, is a kleptomaniac.
[01:09:07.219 --> 01:09:09.501]  And since she's in power, they have a name for it.
[01:09:09.601 --> 01:09:11.122]  It's a kleptocrat.
[01:09:12.384 --> 01:09:14.065]  With a bunch of weird delusionals.
[01:09:14.085 --> 01:09:18.670]  Man, when you watch those pseudo-press conferences she does with her lapdogs on her jet,
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:29.883]  When you look at the videos of him, the people are fawning like it's 1957 and he's Elvis Presley and they're college girls throwing their panties at him.
[01:09:31.943 --> 01:09:37.345]  I'm sure everybody's seen the famous footage of just... I mean, this is what we're talking about here.
[01:09:38.905 --> 01:09:40.286]  She's not Elvis Presley!
[01:09:41.246 --> 01:09:42.606]  She's a demonic demon!
[01:09:43.406 --> 01:09:45.907]  I found a photo that really encapsulates what she looks like.
[01:09:45.967 --> 01:09:47.368]  I've told the crew to show it a lot.
[01:09:47.528 --> 01:09:48.388]  Can we put that on screen?
[01:09:49.386 --> 01:09:50.387]  Or if not, I've got it on my phone.
[01:09:50.647 --> 01:09:52.968]  Because this is emblematic of the real spirit of Hillary.
[01:09:54.029 --> 01:09:54.689]  I've talked to folks.
[01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:56.070]  It's not that big jack-o'-lantern smile.
[01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.690]  That's her fake smile.
[01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:58.532]  It's this creepy witch look.
[01:10:00.833 --> 01:10:03.975]  Now, joining us for the rest of the hour is James Wesley Rawls.
[01:10:04.055 --> 01:10:05.756]  But we are going to find that image and put it on screen.
[01:10:07.137 --> 01:10:08.998]  Because it's the big emblematic one and I want to get it.
[01:10:09.058 --> 01:10:09.658]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:10:09.758 --> 01:10:10.999]  That's the real Hillary Clinton.
[01:10:11.179 --> 01:10:12.260]  In fact, I want to put out
[01:10:14.784 --> 01:10:15.905]  A meme contest.
[01:10:16.745 --> 01:10:17.826]  But no money for this one.
[01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:28.314]  You'll just be recognized on air in Fight the Evil, where somebody puts a thought bubble on her and just makes a basic statement and then just get that out to everybody and say, hey, I really want to start a nuclear war.
[01:10:28.894 --> 01:10:33.417]  Or, you know, the devil tells me that I've got to move fast because the time is short.
[01:10:33.457 --> 01:10:35.559]  I mean, what do you put on that photo?
[01:10:36.199 --> 01:10:39.922]  I want to post it to Infowars.com and let's create a meme contest.
[01:10:40.282 --> 01:10:40.803]  The winner
[01:10:42.853 --> 01:10:45.474]  Gets one of all of our nutraceutical products.
[01:10:45.514 --> 01:10:46.434]  That's a huge value.
[01:10:46.954 --> 01:10:50.035]  And we'll announce the winner on Tuesday of next week.
[01:10:50.095 --> 01:10:52.876]  Just send them to Facebook, send them to Twitter, send them to us.
[01:10:52.936 --> 01:10:53.597]  We'll post them.
[01:10:54.177 --> 01:10:57.158]  Some of these memes, some of these images will get seen by four or five million people.
[01:10:58.318 --> 01:11:06.141]  Guess how many people the Danny Williams press conference that mainstream media tried to shut down Wednesday night.
[01:11:07.219 --> 01:11:12.501]  Guess how many views that has as of last night when I was talking to Roger Stone and was going to different Facebooks.
[01:11:13.321 --> 01:11:19.964]  On Danny Williams' Facebook, last night, it had 16 million views.
[01:11:21.884 --> 01:11:23.705]  Guess how many it has on our Facebook?
[01:11:24.845 --> 01:11:26.006]  Upwards of 3 million.
[01:11:26.606 --> 01:11:29.407]  Guess how much it has when we checked 4 or 5 other ones?
[01:11:31.008 --> 01:11:34.689]  Stone and I spent 20 minutes looking at this over the phone with our computers up.
[01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:39.151]  It looks like it's been seen about 30 million times.
[01:11:39.871 --> 01:11:42.331]  Now, we have this stuff happening every few days now.
[01:11:43.652 --> 01:11:47.993]  Paul had a video that now has 25 million views he put out two weeks ago.
[01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:50.333]  25 million!
[01:11:51.333 --> 01:11:52.614]  Of course they want to kill the internet.
[01:11:52.794 --> 01:11:54.074]  Of course they want to shut down free speech.
[01:11:54.634 --> 01:11:57.775]  CNN doesn't have 25 million viewers in a week, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:59.011 --> 01:12:00.572]  They are a facade.
[01:12:00.732 --> 01:12:01.913]  They know they're a facade.
[01:12:02.713 --> 01:12:04.955]  Trump is going to win in a landslide unless they steal it.
[01:12:05.135 --> 01:12:10.298]  And now Reuters is saying the Russians are going to plant stories with Trump of election fraud.
[01:12:10.498 --> 01:12:13.360]  So there's no election fraud, but the Russians are going to take the election over.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:16.602]  And if you see stories about Clinton fraud, it's the Russkies.
[01:12:16.782 --> 01:12:17.882]  That's Reuters today.
[01:12:18.243 --> 01:12:18.543]  U.S.
[01:12:18.843 --> 01:12:23.486]  vote authorities warned to be alert to Russian hacks, fake fraud.
[01:12:25.276 --> 01:12:29.480]  Meanwhile, we hear that they want to strike and put up a no-fly zone, which is an act of war.
[01:12:30.321 --> 01:12:33.483]  The head of the Joint Chiefs, General Dunford, told them that two weeks ago.
[01:12:33.764 --> 01:12:34.965]  The head of the Army, a week and a half ago.
[01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:38.007]  Milley says, prepare for a war as big as World War II.
[01:12:38.027 --> 01:12:38.648]  These are quotes.
[01:12:39.509 --> 01:12:41.110]  You've heard us play the clips probably 20 times.
[01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:48.156]  And that's why it's a perfect time to have James Wesley Rawls on, former Army intelligence.
[01:12:49.127 --> 01:12:54.990]  Best-selling author, heads up survivalblog.com, probably the top survival blog site out there.
[01:12:55.551 --> 01:13:04.596]  We have Colonel Schaefer from London Center joining us, the former head of the anti-Al Qaeda unit, who first exposed basically the entire Benghazi story.
[01:13:05.484 --> 01:13:12.188]  And they called him in after he was on the show four years ago and basically threatened him with more than just his job when he brought that out.
[01:13:12.228 --> 01:13:12.628]  But you know what?
[01:13:12.648 --> 01:13:13.189]  He's a patriot.
[01:13:13.209 --> 01:13:13.789]  He told the truth.
[01:13:14.109 --> 01:13:15.870]  And it has been proven absolutely on target.
[01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:20.853]  But we have Russian warships filmed off coast of Britain as Royal Navy shadows Syrian-bound vessels through English Channel.
[01:13:21.333 --> 01:13:24.095]  You've got Deutsche Bank about to implode.
[01:13:25.196 --> 01:13:27.357]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:13:27.397 --> 01:13:28.858]  And you've got these different power structures.
[01:13:30.498 --> 01:13:32.039]  That are on a collision course.
[01:13:32.059 --> 01:13:35.762]  You have China meeting with the head of the Philippines, giving them full honors.
[01:13:37.283 --> 01:13:38.684]  Obama has to get off the back of the plane.
[01:13:38.964 --> 01:13:41.646]  Philippines says it's going to merge with China now, give them bases.
[01:13:42.047 --> 01:13:44.468]  I mean, this is the type of stuff that starts world wars.
[01:13:45.329 --> 01:13:53.055]  And by the way, we've gone from world war being a big possibility a year ago to now looking like, oh my gosh, I hope it doesn't happen.
[01:13:53.375 --> 01:13:54.296]  Why is it happening?
[01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:56.297]  James Wesley Rawls, survivalblog.com.
[01:13:57.861 --> 01:14:00.243]  That's selling off his latest novel titled Land of Promise.
[01:14:00.744 --> 01:14:02.265]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:14:03.907 --> 01:14:05.008]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:10.613]  I mean, do you think I put it out there accurately, or I mean, where are we right now?
[01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:13.195]  Yeah, you summed things up pretty well.
[01:14:13.255 --> 01:14:16.018]  We are living in very perilous times.
[01:14:16.078 --> 01:14:17.800]  Things seem to be spinning out of control.
[01:14:18.909 --> 01:14:22.171]  Much faster than the powers that be can handle them.
[01:14:23.332 --> 01:14:31.717]  They've created these structures, these forces in the world that are now beyond their grasp.
[01:14:32.237 --> 01:14:33.978]  They've created things.
[01:14:34.098 --> 01:14:35.519]  They created ISIS, for example.
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:41.323]  They created the civil war, which became a regional war in Syria.
[01:14:42.543 --> 01:14:44.985]  And all of these things have spun out of control
[01:14:46.499 --> 01:14:50.740]  It's like Yates' poem, you know, spinning and spinning in a widening gyre.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.901]  That's the situation we're in now.
[01:14:54.741 --> 01:14:59.302]  And we are, as you mentioned, very near the brink of a third world war.
[01:15:00.222 --> 01:15:14.646]  And we have Hillary Clinton, for the sake of political gain, playing brinksmanship, pushing toward activating a no-fly zone over Syria, which
[01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:18.193]  Would indeed be a severe provocation.
[01:15:18.253 --> 01:15:25.919]  All it takes is one or two Russian aircraft being shot down and it'll be game on.
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:30.143]  We are living in very, very perilous times.
[01:15:31.438 --> 01:15:38.760]  I go to the psychology, the criminology, and I know you don't like to brag about yourself, but I've talked to a lot of pretty high up folks and they said, hey, you want to have somebody on who's smart, James Wesley Rawls.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.021]  I've been interviewing you for 15 years, but I mean, you know what you're talking about.
[01:15:42.041 --> 01:15:42.761]  You're a smart guy.
[01:15:42.781 --> 01:15:43.921]  I'm a smart guy.
[01:15:44.441 --> 01:15:45.942]  But I want to think we're wrong.
[01:15:46.222 --> 01:15:48.042]  But then all the other smart guys concur.
[01:15:48.102 --> 01:15:49.683]  This is the craziest thing they've ever seen.
[01:15:50.663 --> 01:15:54.864]  The top brass are telling Hillary and Obama and everybody back off.
[01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:55.984]  This is going to cause World War Three.
[01:15:56.004 --> 01:15:56.864]  And they don't seem to care.
[01:15:56.884 --> 01:15:58.305]  And then I go to the psychology.
[01:15:59.335 --> 01:16:05.298]  It's now come out in the WikiLeaks, and the FBI's released documents as well, that she steals furniture everywhere she goes.
[01:16:05.678 --> 01:16:09.699]  She steals business silverware when she's in your house.
[01:16:09.879 --> 01:16:15.802]  I'm saying, this shows serious mental illness when someone is a kleptocrat on top of all this.
[01:16:15.842 --> 01:16:17.062]  She clearly is out of her mind.
[01:16:19.203 --> 01:16:27.627]  Not only is she running a kleptocratic system, but when she's personally a kleptomaniac, what does that tell you?
[01:16:30.234 --> 01:16:35.537]  I cannot believe that this woman is being seriously considered as a presidential candidate.
[01:16:35.777 --> 01:16:50.426]  And with just the torrent of information that's coming out of Wikileaks right now, from within the DNC, from within the Clinton Foundation, it just absolutely boggles the mind to think that she's being considered seriously.
[01:16:52.427 --> 01:16:54.729]  We have a situation
[01:16:55.672 --> 01:17:22.399]  Where we may have a manipulated presidential election, may have a split outcome with a difference between the popular vote and the electoral vote, and we have a kind of a criminal power structure in place right now that's willing to either collapse the system or bring the world to another world war just for the sake of furthering their own power.
[01:17:23.146 --> 01:17:26.482]  That's how absolutely corrupt and evil they are.
[01:17:27.688 --> 01:17:27.768]  Wow.
[01:17:58.525 --> 01:18:16.990]  It's amazing to see so many people with such corrupt morals and so downright sociopathic or psychopathic rise to levels of power and influence where the most power-hungry amongst them
[01:18:17.839 --> 01:18:19.901]  Are actually the ones who want to be behind the scenes.
[01:18:20.041 --> 01:18:20.401]  That's right.
[01:18:20.461 --> 01:18:22.843]  In fact, I had a big Psychology Today article yesterday.
[01:18:22.863 --> 01:18:25.364]  I saw a couple of them making fun of me saying she's a psycho.
[01:18:25.685 --> 01:18:33.230]  I mean, she brags about killing people and destabilizing all of Africa and steals 94% of the Haitian money for herself.
[01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:34.331]  She's a monster!
[01:18:34.351 --> 01:18:37.433]  Oh, I agree.
[01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:38.934]  I agree, absolutely.
[01:18:40.575 --> 01:18:44.518]  Getting back to today's headlines, Alex, I wanted to
[01:18:45.399 --> 01:18:52.423]  To underscore what happened with the internet DDoS attack this morning, primarily on the East Coast.
[01:18:52.543 --> 01:18:55.485]  Yes, I haven't even mentioned that giant attack, huge outages.
[01:18:56.946 --> 01:19:01.969]  Yeah, the article just came out an hour ago on TheAtlantic.com.
[01:19:03.370 --> 01:19:05.851]  It describes how that might have been carried out.
[01:19:06.432 --> 01:19:11.955]  Apparently, the amount of hacking that's been going on for the last 10 years or so
[01:19:12.938 --> 01:19:38.244]  Has been very carefully calculated and it's been very insidious in that it has been injecting malware into systems throughout the Internet, not just on major servers, but also apparently on what's called the Internet of Things, which refers to the processing power of all of the distributed
[01:19:40.126 --> 01:19:43.908]  Internet-connected computers that might be vulnerable.
[01:19:44.168 --> 01:19:51.493]  A lot of those have passwords that are just kind of burned in, what they call hard password, hard-coded.
[01:19:52.374 --> 01:20:02.300]  And systematically over the last 10 years, a lot of those processors, some of them quite small, but have been co-opted.
[01:20:02.981 --> 01:20:06.003]  But when you harness all that computing power together,
[01:20:07.014 --> 01:20:19.069]  It gives a hacker the ability to have a tremendous power to create what's called a ping flood, which is a distributed denial of service attack.
[01:20:19.089 --> 01:20:20.450]  A giant zombie attack.
[01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:24.295]  My website has been attacked with ping floods and I'm sure yours has as well.
[01:20:24.475 --> 01:20:24.635]  Yes.
[01:20:26.206 --> 01:20:32.628]  And I think that the conclusion that the author in The Atlantic has drawn may be correct.
[01:20:33.048 --> 01:20:35.468]  And what we may be seeing is just the beginning.
[01:20:35.508 --> 01:20:42.670]  That may just be a test of what might be unleashed in the event of a global war.
[01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:46.170]  Now, James, let me go there with you because I'm so glad you raised this.
[01:20:46.190 --> 01:20:47.811]  This was a big central point this morning.
[01:20:48.171 --> 01:20:49.631]  It hit me when I saw this news.
[01:20:50.411 --> 01:20:51.932]  And I predicted this.
[01:20:52.192 --> 01:20:53.212]  In fact, I did it last week.
[01:20:54.153 --> 01:20:56.775]  I said they claim the Russians are going to hack our election.
[01:20:56.815 --> 01:20:57.716]  They claim they already have.
[01:20:58.877 --> 01:21:02.920]  They say under new doctrine we can physically attack you, not just launch a cyber attack.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:07.884]  Biden said we're going to hit you with something incredibly hard to teach you a lesson.
[01:21:07.924 --> 01:21:08.784]  That was last week.
[01:21:08.824 --> 01:21:10.065]  He said that on Meet the Press.
[01:21:11.046 --> 01:21:13.208]  And I said, look, the Russians have been standing down.
[01:21:13.248 --> 01:21:15.510]  They've been smart playing chess here, not getting lured in.
[01:21:17.085 --> 01:21:17.265]  Right.
[01:21:17.605 --> 01:21:19.927]  We've been playing checkers while they've been playing chess.
[01:21:48.286 --> 01:21:54.929]  That's quite conceivable, and I hadn't even thought of that particular chain of events, but that very well could happen.
[01:21:56.009 --> 01:22:04.873]  Well, just getting into their psychology, how they always do things to themselves and blame their enemy, or Hillary's a Russian agent and Podesta gets money, so they blame Trump.
[01:22:04.993 --> 01:22:09.795]  They're always blaming people for what they themselves are going to do, and then that is self-fulfilling.
[01:22:09.875 --> 01:22:10.135]  See?
[01:22:10.375 --> 01:22:11.216]  The Russians hit us.
[01:22:13.078 --> 01:22:17.559]  Well, yeah, it certainly fits with the Hegelian dialectic.
[01:22:18.359 --> 01:22:22.860]  And just a step back for just a minute about this particular Ping Flood attack.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:36.483]  If you look at Kaspersky.com and have been watching for the last couple of years the general trend on hack attacks, the vast majority of them are not coming from Russia.
[01:22:37.156 --> 01:22:38.337]  They're coming from China.
[01:22:38.817 --> 01:22:45.460]  In fact, you can see it in real time if your viewers and listeners look at Kaspersky.com.
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:49.702]  It's K-A-S-P-E-R-S-K-Y.com.
[01:22:50.202 --> 01:22:54.084]  They have a real-time map, a global map, that shows hack attacks.
[01:22:55.145 --> 01:23:00.367]  And it's quite enlightening to see the frequency of the attacks coming out of China.
[01:23:00.387 --> 01:23:01.988]  Now, let's war game that again.
[01:23:02.008 --> 01:23:05.630]  There's a lot more going on than what we're being told by the mainstream media.
[01:23:06.212 --> 01:23:07.172]  We're wargaming this.
[01:23:07.352 --> 01:23:10.893]  Survivalblog.com, James Wesley Rawls, I'm interrupting because you're so on target here.
[01:23:11.133 --> 01:23:12.094]  That's my next question.
[01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:20.056]  China is openly chewing us out, openly treating Obama bad on the tarmac, openly in our face, belligerently moving into the South China Sea.
[01:23:20.576 --> 01:23:25.698]  As I mentioned, big deals now with the Philippines, unprecedented since World War II.
[01:23:25.738 --> 01:23:30.039]  So I wargame what they're setting up with Russia, but absolutely
[01:23:30.879 --> 01:23:32.920]  Could it be that China is launching real attacks?
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:36.382]  And as you said, the traffic maps show that is indeed the case.
[01:23:38.363 --> 01:23:39.204]  Well, I believe so.
[01:23:40.044 --> 01:24:00.255]  And if you look at Chinese intentions versus Russian intentions, you know, the long-term goal for the Tsarist Russia, then Soviet Russia, and now independent Russia, has always been to seek warm water ports for their navy.
[01:24:00.985 --> 01:24:01.585]  And for shipping.
[01:24:02.526 --> 01:24:03.667]  That's always been their goal.
[01:24:04.507 --> 01:24:17.296]  China has basically taken on what used to be the long-term goal of Japan, which is to create what used to be called a Greater East Asia Prosperity Sphere.
[01:24:18.337 --> 01:24:29.004]  And if you look at what's going on with their construction of man-made islands in the South China Sea, and now most recently with their détente with
[01:24:29.933 --> 01:24:30.533]  Well, James Wesley...
[01:24:57.867 --> 01:25:03.189]  James Wesley Rawls, I want to, in the next five minutes, let you continue to roll with this.
[01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:08.912]  In your gut, your deep research, your sources, you've been on target, just frighteningly so.
[01:25:10.033 --> 01:25:13.694]  What do you think is about to unfold in the next 17 days and then after that?
[01:25:13.734 --> 01:25:20.357]  Because big banks getting ready to go under, like Deutsche Bank, they say 50 times bigger than Lehman Brothers.
[01:25:21.018 --> 01:25:25.840]  I mean, clearly all the planets are aligning historically for all hell to break loose.
[01:25:27.814 --> 01:25:34.300]  Well, to mention Deutsche Bank for example, their hedge book is absolutely enormous.
[01:25:35.341 --> 01:25:53.958]  If you include both the traditional derivatives, OTC derivatives, and especially the credit market derivatives where they have basically a giant casino going on in terms of bets in terms of which way interest rates are going to move.
[01:25:55.512 --> 01:26:02.476]  In total, it's about $75 trillion notionally in derivatives, which is more than all the money in all the world.
[01:26:04.818 --> 01:26:12.802]  The potential fallout of a derivatives implosion are almost incalculable at this point.
[01:26:13.603 --> 01:26:17.425]  The counterparty risk is huge, and as I've mentioned in my blog,
[01:26:18.288 --> 01:26:28.494]  I think the end result might not be just giant banks like Deutsche Bank going under, but entire nation-states going under.
[01:26:29.014 --> 01:26:36.718]  We could see the collapse of entire nation-states through, if nothing else, just boats of no confidence.
[01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:41.981]  But we could see entire nations go under in the wake of a derivatives collapse.
[01:26:43.502 --> 01:26:45.563]  And the derivatives market, I think, is just
[01:26:48.032 --> 01:27:03.503]  It's emblematic of the overall power structures that have built up in the banking world, in the world of finance and arbitrage, counter-trade, all of it, all together.
[01:27:08.127 --> 01:27:13.691]  It's almost difficult to grasp just how much power has been accumulated
[01:27:14.597 --> 01:27:18.021]  By a very small number of international banks.
[01:27:19.663 --> 01:27:23.126]  And how they have co-opted political processes.
[01:27:24.027 --> 01:27:27.731]  They've co-opted entire national economies.
[01:27:28.492 --> 01:27:29.553]  Entire currencies.
[01:27:30.554 --> 01:27:32.957]  It's all basically under their thumb at this point.
[01:27:35.916 --> 01:27:37.297]  James Leslie Rawls is our guest.
[01:27:37.798 --> 01:27:41.942]  I am listening to him speak while I look at the latest article that just went up on Infowars.com.
[01:27:42.743 --> 01:27:50.391]  I found an emergency video Saturday titled, The United States is technically at war with Russia.
[01:27:51.493 --> 01:27:54.516]  Now, top British general has now come out and said, we are
[01:27:55.757 --> 01:27:59.980]  Technically at war with Russia, and the end of life as we know it is about to happen.
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:14.409]  These are quotes, and I'm not tooting my horn, but I mean when I looked at the new doctrine, the announcement that they're going to hit Russia with a cyber attack, telling them they would, saying we may hit you physically, when you announce we're about to hit you, and including with
[01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:20.033]  You know, classical munitions, physical munitions, that is a declaration.
[01:28:20.333 --> 01:28:25.596]  That is a game on, on guard, I'm coming at you under international law.
[01:28:25.956 --> 01:28:30.098]  And now the top general has come out and said that technically the U.S.
[01:28:30.158 --> 01:28:40.224]  is now at war and that Russia may invade, almost like Hitler invaded Russia with Barbarossa when he knew the Russians were about to counter strike or launch an offensive.
[01:28:41.934 --> 01:28:48.356]  I cannot believe we're actually sitting here calmly talking about this, James Wesley Rawls, while the average person is obsessed with the NFL.
[01:28:50.977 --> 01:28:51.598]  Well, certainly.
[01:28:53.398 --> 01:28:57.520]  In this case, it's the United States that's the provocateur here.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.221]  We're the one provoking Russia.
[01:29:02.422 --> 01:29:06.463]  And we've been at it for four years with the Ukraine.
[01:29:06.843 --> 01:29:10.705]  And that game has turned into brinksmanship.
[01:29:11.411 --> 01:29:18.257]  And what's going on with Syria is a serious game of brinksmanship, and there it could very well turn into a shooting war very quickly.
[01:29:18.597 --> 01:29:22.981]  And within one hour of them announcing they were going to put a no-fly zone up a week ago, the Russians launched their fleet.
[01:29:23.122 --> 01:29:26.725]  I mean, the Russians in history are very easy to predict.
[01:29:26.845 --> 01:29:33.471]  I don't know what Hillary, you know, she should just, you know, stick to stealing the furniture from the White House and the State Department instead of World War III.
[01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:37.951]  James Wesley Rawls is our guest, your Bible blog.
[01:29:37.991 --> 01:29:43.953]  You know, I've long been quoted as saying that we're living in the age of deception and betrayal.
[01:29:45.054 --> 01:29:56.218]  And to see politics come ahead of our national interest, even at the risk of nuclear war, is absolutely astounding.
[01:29:56.238 --> 01:29:56.578]  You're right.
[01:29:56.598 --> 01:29:57.139]  Stay there, sir.
[01:29:57.179 --> 01:29:57.879]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:58.279 --> 01:29:59.059]  I'm just in somewhere.
[01:29:59.079 --> 01:29:59.860]  We're on the march.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.920]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:02.841 --> 01:30:05.522]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.889]  U.S.
[01:30:10.929 --> 01:30:19.074]  intelligence and law enforcement officials are again coming out and warning of Russian interference in the United States presidential election, but this time in a different tone.
[01:30:19.335 --> 01:30:30.522]  Now the intelligence agencies say Russian hackers will undermine the upcoming election by posting documents online reporting to show evidence that election fraud had happened and that Russia is hacking voter registration bases.
[01:30:30.982 --> 01:30:39.985]  They went on to say that the election is so large it is impossible for a hacker to change the outcome, so instead Russia will just resort to reporting election fraud online, fraudulently.
[01:30:40.345 --> 01:30:42.125]  State and local authorities have been warned.
[01:30:42.405 --> 01:30:53.608]  So wait a second, we have mass amounts of evidence of voter fraud piling up almost daily, we have US officials warning of Russian interference, but Obama has never heard of a rigged election, and Trump is crazy for monitoring the results.
[01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:58.910]  The truth is, they've been caught trying to rig the election, so they are distracting and diverting the blame to Russia.
[01:30:59.070 --> 01:31:03.631]  So now every time you see election fraud happening, it doesn't exist and it's Russia's fault.
[01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:06.072]  This is Owen Troyer from InfoWars.com.
[01:31:09.733 --> 01:31:11.594]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[01:31:13.214 --> 01:31:18.896]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:31:19.596 --> 01:31:23.477]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:31:24.435 --> 01:31:26.677]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:31:26.757 --> 01:31:27.918]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:31:28.578 --> 01:31:31.160]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[01:31:32.121 --> 01:31:32.461]  Or more.
[01:31:32.562 --> 01:31:34.443]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:31:34.983 --> 01:31:36.985]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[01:31:37.666 --> 01:31:39.927]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:31:40.007 --> 01:31:41.829]  It's actually scary.
[01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:52.697]  And it's because I take products that are researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:31:53.738 --> 01:32:06.529]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[01:32:09.525 --> 01:32:16.631]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:32:17.012 --> 01:32:30.223]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:32:31.144 --> 01:32:42.399]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:49.027]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[01:32:49.768 --> 01:32:58.156]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[01:32:58.776 --> 01:33:07.004]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[01:33:14.076 --> 01:33:19.400]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[01:33:20.661 --> 01:33:27.446]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them, on our journey to hell.
[01:33:29.747 --> 01:33:35.491]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:35.511 --> 01:33:36.772]  17 days out!
[01:33:36.792 --> 01:33:37.373]  17 days out!
[01:33:37.633 --> 01:33:41.816]  And as Nigel Farage points out in a big, exclusive interview we've got,
[01:33:43.151 --> 01:33:47.333]  Coming up in the fourth hour with David Nights, who did the interview with him.
[01:33:48.773 --> 01:33:50.354]  You'll only hear like four or five minutes of it.
[01:33:50.794 --> 01:33:52.655]  It's powerful, but the whole interview is going to be air.
[01:33:52.695 --> 01:33:54.196]  His warning to America.
[01:33:56.557 --> 01:33:57.897]  This is just the beginning of the fight.
[01:33:58.157 --> 01:34:00.859]  And that's why the globalists realize their whole New World Order is falling apart.
[01:34:01.139 --> 01:34:02.199]  The EU is falling apart.
[01:34:02.699 --> 01:34:03.560]  Russia is pulling out.
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:04.660]  The UK is pulling out.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.361]  Catalonia is pulling out.
[01:34:08.251 --> 01:34:09.832]  Africa's figuring out what's going on.
[01:34:10.892 --> 01:34:12.252]  So much is Latin America.
[01:34:12.733 --> 01:34:13.533]  They're panicking.
[01:34:13.653 --> 01:34:15.293]  Their global system is in trouble.
[01:34:16.094 --> 01:34:18.514]  Because it's a system that wants to make us poor to control us.
[01:34:18.554 --> 01:34:19.515]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:34:19.915 --> 01:34:21.976]  But, I mean, people are like, well, we always heard that from you anyways.
[01:34:22.436 --> 01:34:25.937]  Exactly, because it's in Cloward and Piven, and it's feudalism.
[01:34:27.738 --> 01:34:29.478]  It's keep you poor, keep you controlled.
[01:34:29.578 --> 01:34:30.378]  It's sharecropping.
[01:34:30.478 --> 01:34:31.779]  It's soft slavery.
[01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:34.660]  Now, I'm not going to belabor this.
[01:34:36.084 --> 01:34:37.926]  Obviously, you need high quality storable foods.
[01:34:38.106 --> 01:34:38.586]  I've got them.
[01:34:39.167 --> 01:34:40.528]  Solar panel systems, you name it.
[01:34:40.648 --> 01:34:41.989]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:34:42.289 --> 01:34:43.570]  The highest quality storable foods.
[01:34:43.650 --> 01:34:44.251]  Fresh packed.
[01:34:44.591 --> 01:34:45.432]  Last 25 years.
[01:34:45.472 --> 01:34:46.813]  If you haven't got storable foods, you're nuts.
[01:34:47.934 --> 01:34:54.739]  If you don't have AM, FM, emergency radio, a shortwave that's crank powered and solar powered, you need one.
[01:34:54.759 --> 01:34:55.179]  We've got it.
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:56.721]  Non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[01:34:56.801 --> 01:34:59.243]  Styrosave in case of a nuclear attack to protect the thyroid.
[01:34:59.663 --> 01:35:01.264]  Our survival shield, Nacinitin X2.
[01:35:02.927 --> 01:35:04.147]  Gravity-fed water filters.
[01:35:04.287 --> 01:35:05.808]  We don't sell firearms, but you need them.
[01:35:06.328 --> 01:35:08.048]  And I'm not trying to fear-monger here, folks.
[01:35:08.608 --> 01:35:09.668]  I sell what I take.
[01:35:09.788 --> 01:35:12.369]  I take super-good selenium, we put it out.
[01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:15.029]  I take good iodine, we put it out.
[01:35:15.469 --> 01:35:16.990]  I take good multivitamins, we put it out.
[01:35:17.010 --> 01:35:20.950]  We fund ourselves with the highest quality products that everybody needs.
[01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:30.112]  And then you shop with the good guys, and it builds this infrastructure, and you see us hire more reporters, get more done, have Hillary and Obama attacking us every day now, because we're in their face.
[01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:33.170]  We're not scared of these people.
[01:35:33.190 --> 01:35:34.411]  We're scared of them having their way.
[01:35:35.291 --> 01:35:36.211]  So thanks for supporting us.
[01:35:36.291 --> 01:35:41.313]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:35:41.653 --> 01:35:57.139]  We can avert all this and this brinksmanship because a lot of good generals and people in government are actually, and I've never been somebody to kiss the butt of the military or even the FBI, but as I got more informed and as the world changed, I've seen better resistance from police,
[01:35:58.274 --> 01:36:05.118]  The military, even FBI agents who are leaking stuff, Secret Service agents, that I've seen from the general public.
[01:36:05.158 --> 01:36:05.939]  I mean, that's just a fact.
[01:36:05.979 --> 01:36:13.123]  So that's why they want us to have a civil war against them and wipe out their opposition, just like Hillary funded people to go dressed as Bernie supporters.
[01:36:13.623 --> 01:36:16.105]  They said mentally ill people and alcoholics and drug addicts.
[01:36:16.145 --> 01:36:17.666]  Like I told you, it's in the WikiLeaks now.
[01:36:18.046 --> 01:36:22.749]  We had it from the Chicago police, though, to then go in and attack
[01:36:23.993 --> 01:36:29.554]  Trump people blame them and blame Sanders who's not, you know, involved Hillary.
[01:36:30.154 --> 01:36:31.835]  It's simple war, folks.
[01:36:32.915 --> 01:36:35.356]  It's simple war, and the public's got to figure this out.
[01:36:35.596 --> 01:36:37.376]  You're under globalist attack.
[01:36:37.636 --> 01:36:38.456]  They're crazy.
[01:36:39.017 --> 01:36:42.958]  They've never been defeated so far, so they're delusional like Hitler or Napoleon.
[01:36:43.378 --> 01:36:44.398]  It's crazy.
[01:36:45.478 --> 01:36:48.400]  And as usual, history repeats, they go, where?
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:49.981]  To start the big war, Russia.
[01:36:50.541 --> 01:36:54.423]  Where's the one place they haven't gotten full control of, they go in there to have a big pissing contest.
[01:36:54.743 --> 01:36:55.864]  But now there's nuclear weapons.
[01:36:56.164 --> 01:36:57.345]  We have to stop this.
[01:36:57.845 --> 01:37:00.287]  Folks, if Russia was doing things to us, I'd be calling for war.
[01:37:01.227 --> 01:37:01.567]  They're not.
[01:37:03.048 --> 01:37:05.290]  The same globalists that are screwing us are screwing them.
[01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:07.031]  That's why we're natural allies.
[01:37:07.431 --> 01:37:08.552]  We don't work for the Russians.
[01:37:08.592 --> 01:37:10.173]  We work for not dying.
[01:37:10.813 --> 01:37:12.334]  We work for being decent.
[01:37:13.595 --> 01:37:15.697]  So InfoWareStore.com, get the products.

[01:37:27.906 --> 01:37:29.767]  I mean, I can put it on screen right now and we're going back to our guest.
[01:37:30.668 --> 01:37:33.450]  This is a video I shot this weekend.
[01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:34.671]  I work seven days a week now.
[01:37:35.851 --> 01:37:37.973]  My family's like, please, dad, where are you?
[01:37:38.554 --> 01:37:42.639]  Kids, normally I'd be here, but for nuclear war, we're dead, probably, so I gotta do this.
[01:37:43.039 --> 01:37:44.881]  I mean, that's what's happening right now.
[01:37:45.402 --> 01:37:48.906]  And I put out a video, emergency war declared on Russia by Soros-controlled U.S.
[01:37:49.386 --> 01:37:54.732]  I have another video that I shot from home that day, where I say we are now technically at war with Russia.
[01:37:54.932 --> 01:37:56.034]  The exact words
[01:37:57.824 --> 01:37:59.265]  I'm just pointing out, folks, I don't play games.
[01:37:59.305 --> 01:38:00.086]  I know what I'm talking about.
[01:38:00.446 --> 01:38:02.287]  Top British general warns of nuclear war with Russia.
[01:38:02.507 --> 01:38:03.568]  The end of life as we know it.
[01:38:03.868 --> 01:38:05.890]  Claims Moscow plans to march into Baltic states.
[01:38:06.170 --> 01:38:17.879]  Senior British Army officer and former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, General Richard Sheriff, warns that NATO forces faces nuclear war with Russia in Europe, close quote, and that America's already technically at war with Russia.
[01:38:18.908 --> 01:38:28.813]  In a hawkish argument with CNN, he asserts that the West faces the biggest threat from Russia since World War, and that Vladimir Putin plans to re-establish Russian status as one of the world's great powers by marching into Baltic states.
[01:38:29.173 --> 01:38:36.577]  They're starting wars in Baltic states, seizing Russian infrastructure they paid for, and giving it to Joe Biden's son.
[01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:41.360]  So, he tells the truth about the state of war, but then blames Russia.
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:47.243]  Soros brags on CNN with Fareed Zakaria that he spent billions and that he did the whole deal.
[01:38:48.783 --> 01:38:50.264]  So take action, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:50.544 --> 01:38:53.566]  Now, going back to James Wesley Rawls, I should point out survivalblog.com.
[01:38:53.847 --> 01:38:57.689]  I want to get back soon to talk about his novels, but there's always too much big news breaking.
[01:38:58.270 --> 01:38:59.611]  What do you make of this?
[01:39:00.879 --> 01:39:01.840]  Because I'm asking the questions.
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:03.761]  Instead of me asking the questions, you're a smart guy.
[01:39:04.061 --> 01:39:05.182]  What is on your radar?
[01:39:05.482 --> 01:39:06.743]  What else should we be worried about?
[01:39:07.003 --> 01:39:08.764]  They're clearly trying to stage race riots.
[01:39:09.024 --> 01:39:10.185]  They're trying to destabilize things.
[01:39:10.505 --> 01:39:11.505]  What is their plan?
[01:39:11.886 --> 01:39:14.327]  Because, I mean, we know it's consolidate power.
[01:39:14.387 --> 01:39:17.909]  The new WikiLeaks are out where they want to create a global government and consolidate control.
[01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:23.673]  But what's the point of having all this money if it's radioactive and you can't come out of your bunker?
[01:39:25.788 --> 01:39:32.193]  Well, I think that the, you mentioned consolidation of power, I think that's probably their next step.
[01:39:32.654 --> 01:39:45.565]  If they can get Hillary Clinton into office, I think their goal next will be to consolidate power by muzzling journalists on the internet, not people like you and like me.
[01:39:46.870 --> 01:40:10.975]  And by completely co-opting, they're well on their way to doing it already, but completely co-opting all of the mainstream media and coercing them into full submission, where the only information that's going to be available will be information outlets that are going to be parroting the party line.
[01:40:10.995 --> 01:40:13.256]  I think that's their next goal.
[01:40:14.033 --> 01:40:24.615]  Because they won't be able to con the American public into supporting another world war unless they have full control of the media.
[01:40:25.335 --> 01:40:28.456]  And I think their goal will be to shut people like you and me down.
[01:40:29.076 --> 01:40:31.297]  And only a world war gives them that excuse.
[01:40:33.157 --> 01:40:41.899]  Well yeah, it'll take either a global economic collapse or global war for them to be able to justify
[01:40:42.919 --> 01:40:57.589]  In the eyes of policymakers and the generally dumb public of instituting a one-world system of passport control, a one-world currency, and so forth.
[01:40:57.609 --> 01:41:05.815]  The entire agenda, they can only justify that given a major crisis.
[01:41:06.375 --> 01:41:10.338]  And again, it's going to either be an economic collapse or global war.
[01:41:11.499 --> 01:41:18.522]  Because they want to play out their endgame, and the only way they can get there is by rolling out the big guns.
[01:41:21.044 --> 01:41:33.173]  Now, they're doing that, though, on a previous plan that the future battle space hadn't been affected by you and countless others, you know, the thousands of great people and the millions and millions taking action, spreading the word.
[01:41:33.213 --> 01:41:47.003]  I mean, when I mentioned how many views we get now, it wasn't to brag, it was to say, how do they deal with InfoWars having 5 billion views, 1 billion on one channel, but 5 billion conservatively, when I was told by the Vice President of YouTube a year ago,
[01:41:47.543 --> 01:41:52.508]  I mean, it's more than that now that we're probably the biggest thing on YouTube because we allow ourselves to be on anybody's site.
[01:41:52.548 --> 01:41:54.550]  We don't control it on purpose.
[01:41:54.570 --> 01:41:57.092]  I mean, how do they deal with 5 billion views on YouTube?
[01:41:57.472 --> 01:41:58.713]  How do they deal with our videos now?
[01:41:59.659 --> 01:42:00.860]  Routinely getting 20-30 million views.
[01:42:29.799 --> 01:42:32.160]  People now already know who are going to wake up.
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:37.222]  So if they bring in serious tyranny, that just confirms everything and hardens the public.
[01:42:37.402 --> 01:42:42.645]  I mean, we've got a giant awakened mass of people now, probably 50, 60 million that are hardcore.
[01:42:42.705 --> 01:42:45.106]  I don't see how they, I don't see how this dog hunts.
[01:42:47.376 --> 01:42:57.911]  Well, I think that at this point the only thing they can do is to try to completely silence us by removing us from the internet.
[01:42:58.131 --> 01:43:01.236]  By shutting down whole chunks of the internet if they have to.
[01:43:02.405 --> 01:43:11.673]  And of course our countermeasure will be, it's kind of like a distributed, it's kind of a corollary to the distributed denial of service.
[01:43:12.153 --> 01:43:24.843]  It's the distributed assurance of service where your site, my site, and so many others will be mirrored around the world just like Wikileaks has been mirrored.
[01:43:25.684 --> 01:43:29.547]  The reason that Wikileaks has been able to get the information out there
[01:43:30.333 --> 01:43:30.873]  Absolutely.
[01:43:30.893 --> 01:43:34.574]  In fact, what I would recommend that your viewers and listeners do
[01:44:00.666 --> 01:44:23.957]  is get hard copy DVDs of all your movies for example all the documentaries that you put out because if the internet as we know it goes away there's going to be a huge thirst for knowledge out there and it's going to be fulfilled that that thirst is going to be filled by physical distribution
[01:44:25.979 --> 01:44:40.226]  And I've been trying to teach folks the power of hanging up banners just printed out around town, the power of going up billboards and spraying revolutionary information or resistance info, micro-FM, jacking into their systems.
[01:44:40.326 --> 01:44:41.907]  I mean, folks don't understand history.
[01:44:42.087 --> 01:44:46.290]  When real tyranny comes in and you've already got a stay-behind network ready to fight,
[01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:53.972]  Everything we do will be solid gold to the public, and the enemy, I think, is really miscalculating.
[01:44:54.152 --> 01:44:57.633]  I don't think they realize what we've been doing for decades in preparation.
[01:44:57.893 --> 01:45:08.156]  Trying to stop them, trying to save the country, trying to stop the New World Order, and then it almost skids over the finish line, dead on arrival, because even if they try to bring this in, it's going to just blow up in their face.
[01:45:09.662 --> 01:45:11.143]  Well, you're right, Alex.
[01:45:12.244 --> 01:45:17.128]  One thing I want to mention is that I recently took a cross-country trip by road.
[01:45:18.389 --> 01:45:24.413]  And I cannot count the number of Info Wars bumper stickers I saw all across the country.
[01:45:25.114 --> 01:45:27.315]  Small towns, big towns, out on the interstate.
[01:45:28.496 --> 01:45:31.939]  It's almost ubiquitous how many I saw.
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:33.700]  People are waking up.
[01:45:34.341 --> 01:45:35.542]  They can't stop the signal.
[01:45:36.758 --> 01:45:38.720]  I just can't believe that this is actually happening.
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:45.045]  Are they crazy enough, do you think, with this top British general calling for war with Russia right now?
[01:45:45.125 --> 01:45:46.726]  I mean, these people, what is wrong with them?
[01:45:49.287 --> 01:46:03.417]  Well, it's really hard to calculate what their desire, we know what their goal is, but to see what steps they're willing to take in the interim is hard to calculate.
[01:46:03.877 --> 01:46:05.678]  Studying Russia, you know about their history.
[01:46:05.698 --> 01:46:07.519]  I mean, what do you expect to happen?
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:10.181]  I mean, obviously Russia's not going to back down, are they?
[01:46:11.642 --> 01:46:15.585]  No, I don't think they will, but I think that if the Russian government
[01:46:17.112 --> 01:46:21.014]  Is as wise and seasoned as I think it is.
[01:46:21.974 --> 01:46:25.556]  They're going to refrain from physical attacks.
[01:46:26.596 --> 01:46:34.260]  And they are probably going to only operate in the information sphere and the cyber warfare sphere.
[01:46:35.566 --> 01:46:39.428]  They will refrain from physical attacks because they don't want to escalate.
[01:46:39.508 --> 01:46:44.371]  And that's make... look, sure, so the globalists are getting mad, they've been trying to push him into a physical, you're absolutely right.
[01:46:44.631 --> 01:46:46.992]  So, so, what will the globalists do to try to push him into it?
[01:46:48.773 --> 01:46:51.714]  Well, I think Syria is a prime example.
[01:46:52.515 --> 01:46:53.796]  If the U.S.
[01:46:53.836 --> 01:47:04.001]  government and its allies institute an O-Fly zone over northern Syria, it could very well get into a situation where we're literally
[01:47:05.574 --> 01:47:19.804]  I don't know how to sum up how dangerous that is.
[01:47:20.585 --> 01:47:27.610]  How close that could bring out almost the certainty of World War III if that starts happening.
[01:47:29.031 --> 01:47:33.835]  Right now in Syria, everything's being handled by proxies.
[01:47:35.337 --> 01:47:42.818]  Proxy armies, proxy guerrilla groups, foreign funding of foreign weapon shipments.
[01:47:43.499 --> 01:47:50.820]  But it's not toe-to-toe with the Russians or even with the Syrian government itself.
[01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:53.160]  It's all being done through proxies.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:48:02.002]  If we take the next step and have direct conflict, that is the pinnacle of brinksmanship.
[01:48:03.857 --> 01:48:09.240]  And it's not like we're doing this against some super evil thing that, you know, deserves to be facedown.
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:13.963]  I mean, Russia's reforming compared to how evil our leaders are and what they're teaching our kids.
[01:48:14.343 --> 01:48:15.584]  Russia's going in the opposite direction.
[01:48:15.604 --> 01:48:17.685]  They've even had WikiLeaks and State Department cables.
[01:48:17.946 --> 01:48:22.688]  How Hollywood's demanding we take over Russia because of what they're teaching Christianity.
[01:48:22.909 --> 01:48:31.774]  That shows how whacked out our government is that they're willing to risk World War III so that we can, you know, sexually, basically brainwash Russian children.
[01:48:36.404 --> 01:48:45.249]  The level of inversion in our society is almost hard to believe at this point.
[01:48:45.369 --> 01:48:46.950]  Everything has been turned on its head.
[01:48:46.970 --> 01:48:54.175]  Our traditional allies are now being looked at as enemies.
[01:48:55.276 --> 01:49:00.059]  It's almost like something out of George Orwell.
[01:49:01.842 --> 01:49:07.923]  You have the enemy du jour for the sake of the consolidation of power.
[01:49:09.564 --> 01:49:23.847]  It's a situation that is not unprecedented in detail, but in terms of sheer scale.
[01:49:24.736 --> 01:49:27.760]  It is certainly unprecedented.
[01:49:28.161 --> 01:49:33.968]  We've never seen this level of deception, this level of betrayal on this scale before.
[01:49:34.268 --> 01:49:35.069]  I agree.
[01:49:35.170 --> 01:49:38.013]  And this demonic push towards death and destruction.
[01:49:38.274 --> 01:49:42.499]  Looking at Hillary's psychology and talking to folks that know her, she's clearly a sociopath bare minimum.
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:44.141]  She's disconnected.
[01:49:44.201 --> 01:49:46.162]  She's pretty much running Obama on the show now.
[01:49:46.183 --> 01:49:47.724]  A lot of evidence shows from these emails.
[01:49:47.744 --> 01:49:49.205]  You know, the group behind her, Soros.
[01:49:49.665 --> 01:49:52.488]  Is there anything we can do to Hillary or Soros in communication?
[01:49:52.508 --> 01:49:53.549]  Because we know they listen and watch.
[01:49:53.889 --> 01:49:55.570]  They can shift them out of their craziness.
[01:49:56.885 --> 01:50:02.290]  I mean, is there any reason to even aim Infowar in a nice way to them and say, please don't destroy the world?
[01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:04.512]  Or does that just get them on more of a power trip?
[01:50:04.912 --> 01:50:08.595]  Maybe that's wishful thinking on our part, Alex, to think that they would actually listen to us.
[01:50:09.356 --> 01:50:17.983]  But if I could sit down and tell George Soros, who's the real power behind the throne, one thing, it is back off.
[01:50:18.703 --> 01:50:24.428]  Because it's not just the American citizenry, it's the citizenry of the planet.
[01:50:25.242 --> 01:50:28.803]  Oh yeah, if there's a nuclear war, I mean these people...
[01:50:48.018 --> 01:50:49.439]  They're just so crazy, though.
[01:50:49.599 --> 01:50:53.100]  I mean, crazy Soros and his crazy kid that's taking it all over.
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:58.422]  He's like, all over the internet, you know, bombed out of his brain in videos, acting like a moron.
[01:50:58.482 --> 01:51:02.623]  It's like, I can't believe the intelligence agencies and people are putting up with this.
[01:51:02.643 --> 01:51:04.644]  I mean, I know they're not perfect, but give me a break.
[01:51:04.964 --> 01:51:06.845]  You better look your kids in the eyes, folks.
[01:51:06.865 --> 01:51:07.285]  We'll be back.
[01:51:09.415 --> 01:51:10.836]  I said to Donald, here's what they're doing.
[01:51:10.856 --> 01:51:12.157]  They're setting it up as follows.
[01:51:12.798 --> 01:51:15.940]  For three, four months they've been saying the Russians are hacking our elections.
[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:20.604]  They're saying to protect our elections, which are sacred, we want to turn it over to DHS.
[01:51:20.764 --> 01:51:24.667]  The genius has given us one terrorist attack after another and has done nothing to stop it.
[01:51:24.707 --> 01:51:25.728]  He still has his job, right?
[01:51:26.249 --> 01:51:28.691]  So he wants to now make sure our elections are safe.
[01:51:29.011 --> 01:51:29.832]  Russians are hacking.
[01:51:30.552 --> 01:51:31.673]  Follow the bouncing ball.
[01:51:31.733 --> 01:51:32.313]  No proof.
[01:51:32.673 --> 01:51:50.743]  If Trump wins, which is highly likely by the way, which we can talk about in a minute or two or another time, Trump wins, government declares, oh we have evidence that the Russians hacked it, he's a friend of Putin, the election is null and void, we're going to recall another election in what, six months?
[01:51:50.803 --> 01:51:53.865]  Until then, Mr. Obama has graciously agreed
[01:51:54.825 --> 01:51:58.127]  To continue his public service in the United States of America.
[01:51:58.427 --> 01:51:59.247]  Thank you very much.
[01:51:59.307 --> 01:52:00.428]  We're not taking any questions.
[01:52:00.468 --> 01:52:00.908]  Goodbye.
[01:52:00.928 --> 01:52:11.734]  And we have Biden announcing they're going to launch a giant cyber attack on the Russians and saying if the Russians respond, they may respond militarily, which is a doctrine Hillary came out with two months ago.
[01:52:12.114 --> 01:52:14.395]  And suddenly NATO announced that's their new doctrine.
[01:52:14.615 --> 01:52:16.076]  She's literally calling the show.
[01:52:17.443 --> 01:52:20.304]  All I wanted to say was, I said it to Donald and he didn't take the bait.
[01:52:20.324 --> 01:52:20.904]  I'm glad he didn't.
[01:52:20.984 --> 01:52:24.385]  I said, don't even answer me, because they'll crucify you if you agree with me.
[01:52:25.366 --> 01:52:27.086]  They're going to steal the election.
[01:52:27.266 --> 01:52:28.047]  I'll make it simple.
[01:52:28.087 --> 01:52:30.828]  In the fifth grade, I ran for class president in Queens, New York.
[01:52:31.848 --> 01:52:32.768]  I was a funny kid.
[01:52:32.828 --> 01:52:33.669]  I was a wild kid.
[01:52:33.689 --> 01:52:34.469]  I was out of control.
[01:52:34.509 --> 01:52:36.029]  I won the election by a landslide.
[01:52:36.570 --> 01:52:40.451]  The teacher stood up and said, this election doesn't count.
[01:52:40.791 --> 01:52:43.995]  I think she had another election, and I wasn't class president.
[01:52:44.415 --> 01:52:49.120]  So, hey, look, if it could be done in the fifth grade in the Bronx when I was a kid, why can't they do it to us now, right?
[01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:49.841]  We're just children.
[01:52:50.161 --> 01:52:51.263]  I had a similar thing happen.
[01:52:51.463 --> 01:52:58.230]  You know, when you really do things in this world, you start to learn how rigged they are, and it's just crazy to see them go, in terms of the same newscast.
[01:52:58.951 --> 01:53:00.272]  The Russians are rigging the election.
[01:53:00.592 --> 01:53:02.513]  We're having to bring in the UN to oversee it.
[01:53:02.573 --> 01:53:03.953]  And then meanwhile, Trump's crazy.
[01:53:04.213 --> 01:53:07.675]  He says they're rigging the election, even as we catch election officials admitting the fraud.
[01:53:07.855 --> 01:53:09.195]  We do have a minute or two more if you've got it.
[01:53:09.695 --> 01:53:10.756]  Elaborate on what you're saying.
[01:53:10.936 --> 01:53:11.396]  I mean, I agree.
[01:53:11.416 --> 01:53:14.677]  The internal polls, I know from Trump, but also other big groups are doing internal polls.
[01:53:15.218 --> 01:53:17.299]  5, 10, 15 points ahead in most battleground states.
[01:53:17.599 --> 01:53:18.839]  He's going to win in a landslide.
[01:53:19.099 --> 01:53:22.781]  They're only creating a perception he's way behind, so we buy it right now.
[01:53:22.801 --> 01:53:23.661]  Do you concur with that?
[01:53:23.841 --> 01:53:25.442]  A. B. What happens when he gets in?
[01:53:26.345 --> 01:53:26.566]  100% right.
[01:53:26.586 --> 01:53:27.711]  You and I think the same way.
[01:53:27.751 --> 01:53:29.620]  I said that to Donald yesterday on my radio show.
[01:53:29.660 --> 01:53:29.881]  I said...
[01:53:31.596 --> 01:53:32.076]  Uh, Donald.
[01:53:32.337 --> 01:53:36.760]  I said, what they're doing is they're not trying to get Hillary people to vote for Hillary.
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:38.742]  They've got all the people they could ever, ever get.
[01:53:38.762 --> 01:53:44.926]  I said, what they're trying to do is discourage Trump voters from voting by thinking that it's, it's over already.
[01:53:44.966 --> 01:53:47.568]  They're trying to make them think that he lost, that she won.
[01:53:47.588 --> 01:53:49.810]  So they're going to throw their hands up and not vote for him.
[01:53:50.110 --> 01:53:53.613]  He's got to make sure that people think he can still win, which he can.
[01:53:54.534 --> 01:53:59.397]  And then if all of us who are supporting him come out, I think he will win.
[01:53:59.617 --> 01:54:00.278]  It's that simple.
[01:54:00.458 --> 01:54:01.999]  That's right, you can't steal landslides.
[01:54:02.039 --> 01:54:06.523]  I've interviewed experts who are Democrats, Republicans, die-bold engineers from the highest levels.
[01:54:06.543 --> 01:54:06.963]  They agree.
[01:54:07.644 --> 01:54:09.285]  You cannot steal a landslide.
[01:54:20.046 --> 01:54:28.110]  Folks, if I sound a little hysterical sometimes, I don't do it on purpose, but it tends to cut through to people and get them out of their comfort zone.
[01:54:28.690 --> 01:54:31.451]  Behind the scenes, we're wargaming stuff during these breaks.
[01:54:32.812 --> 01:54:35.753]  That's why I seem so flustered and out of breath a lot of times I'm running around the building.
[01:54:37.354 --> 01:54:38.774]  James O'Keefe is in danger.
[01:54:38.794 --> 01:54:41.195]  They're trying to get him right now.
[01:54:41.295 --> 01:54:42.136]  He's in the air.
[01:54:43.596 --> 01:54:49.339]  James O'Keefe of Veritas, they've given us code keys, you name it, to the big, big bomb.
[01:54:50.393 --> 01:55:00.245]  Okay, and I'm not at liberty yet to get into all this, but they've transferred their footage to us, and this is reportedly so powerful that they've got people after Project Veritas right now.
[01:55:00.265 --> 01:55:03.229]  And again, he's not a drama queen, folks.
[01:55:03.249 --> 01:55:04.190]  He's never done anything like this.
[01:55:04.210 --> 01:55:05.491]  They've arrested him, you name it, before.
[01:55:06.633 --> 01:55:12.355]  This is getting bad, so he's the guy obviously bringing them down, showing all the fraud, the top officials admitting the election fraud.
[01:55:12.735 --> 01:55:15.316]  He had even bigger stuff he was telling us that was coming out next week.
[01:55:16.316 --> 01:55:19.237]  They may launch it early today on this show just to get it out.
[01:55:19.778 --> 01:55:24.319]  So, separately we were given Oprah Winfrey footage nobody else has got.
[01:55:24.719 --> 01:55:27.700]  It's supposed to launch next week, but there's boffins everywhere, folks.
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:28.721]  People don't want this to happen.
[01:55:28.981 --> 01:55:30.201]  People say, we're Russian agents.
[01:55:30.241 --> 01:55:31.582]  We're agents of not destroying the world.
[01:55:32.242 --> 01:55:37.044]  So once stuff gets bad, that's the backlash that InfoWars is willing to resist.
[01:55:37.104 --> 01:55:38.805]  The problem is there's not many other big outlets.
[01:55:38.825 --> 01:55:40.446]  There's Drudge, Breitbart, a few others.
[01:55:41.186 --> 01:55:44.868]  Quite frankly though, Breitbart has too many lawyers involved and analyzes everything.
[01:55:45.128 --> 01:55:46.508]  We're just all in now at this point.
[01:55:47.249 --> 01:55:48.549]  James Leslie Rawls is our guest.
[01:55:48.810 --> 01:55:50.090]  We've got nuclear war news.
[01:55:50.130 --> 01:55:52.651]  Top British general says we're already at war with Russia.
[01:55:52.671 --> 01:55:53.832]  I mean, I told you that over the weekend.
[01:55:54.352 --> 01:55:55.513]  People are like, this is incendiary.
[01:55:55.573 --> 01:55:56.494]  No, technically we are.
[01:55:56.514 --> 01:55:58.115]  And this is the insanity.
[01:55:58.175 --> 01:56:00.837]  But that's all going to be breaking next hour.
[01:56:01.017 --> 01:56:03.199]  I've got to go talk to the O'Keefe people during this next break.
[01:56:03.599 --> 01:56:04.480]  James Wesley Rawls.
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:06.562]  Folks can find your books at survivalblog.com.
[01:56:06.622 --> 01:56:07.262]  All your great work.
[01:56:07.623 --> 01:56:10.825]  Landon Promise, the first book in the Counter-Caliphate Chronicles.
[01:56:10.865 --> 01:56:11.426]  Let me ask you this.
[01:56:11.726 --> 01:56:14.128]  How does the Black Lives Matter Communist Brigade
[01:56:14.648 --> 01:56:18.190]  Billion dollars has been spent the last five years fomenting civil unrest.
[01:56:18.210 --> 01:56:18.610]  The U.N.
[01:56:18.650 --> 01:56:19.711]  announcing they want to be over.
[01:56:20.071 --> 01:56:22.072]  Our police bringing in the Islamists.
[01:56:22.532 --> 01:56:29.136]  Isn't that really the time bomb they're bringing in to activate, just to create disorder whenever they need to?
[01:56:30.776 --> 01:56:40.101]  Well, yes, they've already accomplished that in Europe, and I think their goal is to do the same thing here in the States by bringing in large numbers of unvetted
[01:56:41.883 --> 01:56:44.845]  so-called refugees from the Islamic world.
[01:56:45.765 --> 01:57:03.875]  They want to have a built-in system whereby they could have essentially thousands and thousands of sleeper agents in the country that they can activate whenever they'd like to create total chaos.
[01:57:04.756 --> 01:57:12.804]  They've already accomplished that goal in Europe, and we're probably five to ten years away from that here in the United States.
[01:57:18.008 --> 01:57:18.369]  What do we do?
[01:57:18.409 --> 01:57:19.229]  Get right with God?
[01:57:19.249 --> 01:57:22.993]  I mean, how do we reach out to the average people that just seem like they're in fantasyland?
[01:57:25.375 --> 01:57:29.279]  Well, I think prayer is what we should start with.
[01:57:29.919 --> 01:57:30.520]  People shouldn't
[01:57:31.314 --> 01:57:37.256]  They should accept Christ as their Savior, and they should sit down and seriously pray.
[01:57:37.756 --> 01:57:43.398]  Pray for our nation, and pray for the protection of our families.
[01:57:44.458 --> 01:57:59.703]  And at this point, as I've mentioned many times in my blog, I think that we as a nation have turned our back on God, and that at this point all we can hope for is that God would still protect His remnant, His covenant people.
[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:23.270]  And they are to be found in all walks of life, in many denominations, and that his remnant will be protected, but we cannot expect God's protection on our entire nation any longer because we've so systematically turned our back on God, starting with Roe v. Wade and going on from there.
[01:58:25.286 --> 01:58:37.618]  And we need as individuals to get down on our knees and pray for God's guidance, providence, and protection, starting with our families and going out to our church families and communities.
[01:58:38.897 --> 01:58:44.902]  And I pray that we, if nothing else, that we would get through this dark time ahead.
[01:58:45.062 --> 01:58:45.462]  That's right.
[01:58:45.502 --> 01:58:47.304]  We need to pray to God to lead God and direct us.
[01:58:47.604 --> 01:58:49.005]  James Wesley Rawls, thank you so much.
[01:58:49.345 --> 01:58:50.586]  The Oprah Winfrey exclusive.
[01:58:51.127 --> 01:58:54.429]  James O'Keefe having to basically launch the emergency plan.
[01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:57.211]  It's all happening right now, and we're still 17 days out.
[01:59:00.524 --> 01:59:02.546]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[01:59:02.807 --> 01:59:04.148]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[01:59:04.388 --> 01:59:07.912]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[01:59:08.272 --> 01:59:16.021]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[01:59:16.241 --> 01:59:21.026]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:59:21.186 --> 01:59:26.669]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[01:59:27.010 --> 01:59:34.534]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[01:59:34.774 --> 01:59:39.197]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[01:59:39.477 --> 01:59:45.240]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:48.321]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[01:59:48.521 --> 01:59:51.803]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[01:59:52.063 --> 01:59:55.725]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:55.965 --> 01:59:58.026]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:00:01.988 --> 02:00:04.589]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:14.503 --> 02:00:20.888]  17 days before America can be great again.
[02:00:20.908 --> 02:00:25.793]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[02:00:26.353 --> 02:00:29.076]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:29.436 --> 02:00:33.139]  Alexander de Tocqueville, the French historian who traveled all over the world, said America was the best.
[02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:39.205]  By leaps and bounds in the 1820s, he said, America is great because America is good.
[02:00:41.730 --> 02:00:43.631]  America is great because America is good.
[02:00:43.651 --> 02:00:46.112]  America is now not very good, is she?
[02:00:47.573 --> 02:00:48.734]  Not in the high places at least.
[02:00:49.574 --> 02:00:52.016]  Now we have this exclusive that just fell on our lap.
[02:00:52.936 --> 02:00:54.137]  This has not aired anywhere yet.
[02:00:54.737 --> 02:00:55.738]  This is Oprah Winfrey.
[02:00:57.538 --> 02:01:03.802]  And I'm just gonna play this so you can, and then I'm gonna comment after you see it, but this is what's coming out next week.
[02:01:05.403 --> 02:01:06.263]  You're seeing it here first.
[02:01:06.283 --> 02:01:07.104]  Here's Oprah Winfrey.
[02:01:08.322 --> 02:01:10.325]  We have focused so much on what divides us.
[02:01:10.505 --> 02:01:10.745]  Yes.
[02:01:10.965 --> 02:01:12.267]  Rather than what unites us.
[02:01:12.347 --> 02:01:12.627]  Yes.
[02:01:12.908 --> 02:01:16.632]  You brought all types of people together that normally would not be together.
[02:01:16.652 --> 02:01:17.754]  That was my goal every day.
[02:01:17.774 --> 02:01:19.636]  How are we going to get that back in this country?
[02:01:19.676 --> 02:01:20.537]  Well, that's a show.
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:24.863]  Right now, this is the only show that can do that.
[02:01:25.043 --> 02:01:27.183]  Because you're talking to real people every day.
[02:01:27.463 --> 02:01:31.304]  There is no platform for public discourse.
[02:01:31.544 --> 02:01:48.107]  The reason why I haven't been vocal, other than saying I'm with her, is because I didn't know what to say that could actually pierce through all the noise and the chaos and the disgusting vitriol that's going on and actually be heard.
[02:01:48.127 --> 02:01:48.927]  It's scary.
[02:01:48.987 --> 02:01:51.348]  It's scary at a time that leadership is so critical.
[02:01:51.368 --> 02:01:53.448]  But there really is no choice, people.
[02:01:53.928 --> 02:01:56.149]  All the people sitting around talking about theater can't decide.
[02:01:56.169 --> 02:01:59.692]  This is what I want to say.
[02:02:01.353 --> 02:02:01.953]  When I'm 30 years old.
[02:02:01.973 --> 02:02:04.415]  This is what I want to say.
[02:02:04.495 --> 02:02:05.816]  And this is what I really want to say.
[02:02:06.536 --> 02:02:15.081]  All the people, I hear this all the time, you get in conversations and there's not a person in this room who hasn't been in the same conversation where people say, I just don't know if I like her.
[02:02:17.443 --> 02:02:18.584]  She's not coming over to your house.
[02:02:23.678 --> 02:02:25.540]  You don't have to like her.
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:27.241]  You don't have to like her.
[02:02:28.022 --> 02:02:29.704]  Do you like this country?
[02:02:29.724 --> 02:02:30.605]  I hear you.
[02:02:30.725 --> 02:02:31.706]  Do you like this country?
[02:02:31.726 --> 02:02:33.848]  You better get out there and vote.
[02:02:33.868 --> 02:02:39.873]  I love this country.
[02:02:39.913 --> 02:02:43.897]  Do you like the country?
[02:02:43.957 --> 02:02:45.819]  When I'm 30 years in, I'm going to call my aunt.
[02:02:46.613 --> 02:02:48.954]  Do you like freedom and liberty?
[02:02:48.974 --> 02:02:51.235]  Do you like this country?
[02:02:52.355 --> 02:02:52.996]  Okay.
[02:02:53.256 --> 02:02:56.577]  Do you like democracy or do you want a demagogue?
[02:02:56.597 --> 02:02:57.097]  Okay.
[02:02:57.117 --> 02:02:57.657]  There you go.
[02:02:57.717 --> 02:02:58.458]  Can't top that.
[02:02:59.977 --> 02:03:00.857]  No, you can't top that.
[02:03:00.957 --> 02:03:02.237]  Another inversion of reality.
[02:03:02.277 --> 02:03:03.278]  She wants war.
[02:03:03.838 --> 02:03:04.718]  She's lying.
[02:03:04.758 --> 02:03:06.698]  We have all the WikiLeaks, the crimes she's committing.
[02:03:06.758 --> 02:03:09.159]  Selling us out to the Russians and blaming Trump.
[02:03:09.599 --> 02:03:14.480]  Funding radical Islamists to suppress women and put little girls into sex slavery all over the world.
[02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:28.322]  And then Oprah Winfrey, who's made billions of dollars off this free market system, promoting this monster criminal that treats her staff like crap, that is an egomaniac, that steals George Washington's plates and cutlery.
[02:03:29.389 --> 02:03:31.451]  That has been involved in every crime you can imagine.
[02:03:31.851 --> 02:03:34.173]  Shipping out tainted blood for a decade.
[02:03:35.494 --> 02:03:41.478]  That they knew had HIV and Hepatitis sent it out of the Arkansas prisons and they got the money to do it and knew what was happening.
[02:03:41.879 --> 02:03:43.300]  Their crimes go on and on and on.
[02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:47.743]  Persecuting Christians and Patriots and Conservatives with the IRS.
[02:03:48.363 --> 02:03:50.145]  Benghazi ordering the stand down.
[02:03:50.465 --> 02:03:51.166]  Lying about it.
[02:03:51.646 --> 02:03:53.267]  Destabilizing Libya.
[02:03:53.607 --> 02:03:56.750]  Blowing it into pieces and then bringing down much of Africa.
[02:03:57.898 --> 02:03:59.521]  Her crimes go on and on and on.
[02:03:59.841 --> 02:04:01.283]  And then Oprah says, you like democracy?
[02:04:01.544 --> 02:04:02.265]  You like freedom?
[02:04:03.086 --> 02:04:08.414]  Well, then you're going to love Hillary Clinton, who is a consummate monster.
[02:04:09.423 --> 02:04:16.207]  And who, Kit Daniels writes in his latest article at Infowars.com, WikiLeaks' Hillary Clinton, editor-in-chief of mainstream media.
[02:04:16.247 --> 02:04:21.410]  Her staff, from the New York Times to CNN to you name it, runs it in giant PR campaigns.
[02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:29.935]  They've even been caught paying thousands of YouTubers to put out pro videos, and tens of thousands of trolls they've hired to run around stirring up garbage on the internet.
[02:04:30.615 --> 02:04:31.335]  Nope for Winfrey.
[02:04:31.836 --> 02:04:35.058]  I tell you, has absolutely discredited herself like nothing I've ever seen.
[02:04:35.518 --> 02:04:36.799]  This is truly disgusting.
[02:04:36.819 --> 02:04:37.259]  So there you go.
[02:04:38.570 --> 02:04:43.132]  Oprah Winfrey officially endorses Hillary Clinton to save democracy.
[02:04:43.793 --> 02:04:44.493]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:44.533 --> 02:04:45.493]  This is InfoWars.
[02:04:46.334 --> 02:04:47.534]  InfoWars.com is the website.
[02:04:47.554 --> 02:04:58.920]  We're going to come back with Colonel Anthony Schaeffer who headed up the unit that tried to kill Bin Laden twice, was ordered to stand down, who exposed what really happened at Benghazi first, and the fact that Obama and Hillary and the rest of them were behind it.
[02:04:59.901 --> 02:05:01.221]  All this and more straight ahead.
[02:05:01.762 --> 02:05:02.482]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:09.653 --> 02:05:14.055]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:05:14.135 --> 02:05:25.059]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:05:25.239 --> 02:05:30.164]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:05:30.284 --> 02:05:32.807]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:05:32.867 --> 02:05:34.348]  It helps detoxify.
[02:05:34.368 --> 02:05:37.392]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:05:37.472 --> 02:05:42.217]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:05:42.237 --> 02:05:46.381]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[02:05:46.781 --> 02:05:48.422]  ...dependent upon selenium.
[02:05:48.442 --> 02:05:53.804]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:05:53.904 --> 02:05:55.344]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[02:05:55.524 --> 02:05:56.264]  This is so key.
[02:05:56.505 --> 02:06:00.806]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:06:00.826 --> 02:06:02.927]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:06:03.047 --> 02:06:06.508]  Exclusively available at m4warslive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:06:09.764 --> 02:06:18.770]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:06:18.850 --> 02:06:27.096]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:06:27.256 --> 02:06:31.960]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:35.802]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[02:06:37.003 --> 02:06:37.803]  We're good to go.
[02:07:00.976 --> 02:07:01.496]  We're good to go.
[02:07:26.664 --> 02:07:29.446]  So with all this, what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen?
[02:07:50.805 --> 02:07:52.688]  What can we do to prevent election fraud?
[02:07:52.828 --> 02:07:55.932]  I propose that all Donald Trump supporters wear red on election day.
[02:07:56.052 --> 02:07:59.797]  On November 8th, when you head to the polls to vote Donald Trump, be decked out in red.
[02:07:59.917 --> 02:08:05.945]  This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout, we can prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout.
[02:08:06.045 --> 02:08:08.949]  Wear red on election day and make America great again.
[02:08:28.084 --> 02:08:29.505]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:08:29.766 --> 02:08:30.947]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:31.407 --> 02:08:36.952]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:37.272 --> 02:08:43.217]  Now, we have a lot of really great patriots on this show, and we've got James O'Keefe right now in the air.
[02:08:43.257 --> 02:08:46.239]  I'm talking to his head guy, who's been exposing all the Democratic fraud.
[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:54.747]  They have never in the decade I've been interviewing him had a real threat like this where they're actually getting ready to release a bunch of stuff they weren't going to release.
[02:08:55.127 --> 02:08:57.469]  They've given us the code keys to release the video.
[02:08:57.949 --> 02:09:00.351]  That's even more damning than what you saw this week and last week.
[02:09:01.072 --> 02:09:02.433]  That was the top story in the country.
[02:09:02.814 --> 02:09:10.060]  The Democratic operatives publicly saying that they're already stealing the election and that they're going to take over the country.
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:12.402]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:09:15.302 --> 02:09:16.543]  We're losing our freedoms right now.
[02:09:16.583 --> 02:09:19.724]  The internet's been handed over to the UN 17, 18 days ago.
[02:09:20.785 --> 02:09:26.327]  We have open calls for no-fly zones with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has said to Congress, we'll cause a war with Russia.
[02:09:26.548 --> 02:09:27.848]  Got a Russian fleet coming in.
[02:09:28.528 --> 02:09:41.575]  Tony Schaefer, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaefer, who ran the main operations to try to take out Al Qaeda, ordered to stand down twice, is probably the most important person out there who first exposed Benghazi one week after it happened.
[02:09:41.935 --> 02:09:43.376]  And believe me, he went through a lot to do that.
[02:09:43.956 --> 02:09:46.440]  They tried to put him in jail for exposing 9-11, but failed as well.
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:48.142]  And the fact that there were stand-downs there.
[02:09:48.603 --> 02:09:49.444]  All that's come out.
[02:09:49.624 --> 02:09:51.287]  Best-selling author of Operation Dark Heart.
[02:09:52.008 --> 02:09:54.692]  His new novel came out three years ago, The Last Line.
[02:09:54.712 --> 02:09:57.275]  Because obviously he can't write something that's, uh...
[02:09:58.553 --> 02:10:01.775]  Non-fiction about what's going to happen, but the last line is now happening.
[02:10:01.795 --> 02:10:04.196]  The Islamic invasion, the sellout, the caliphate.
[02:10:04.576 --> 02:10:05.557]  You want to know what's happening?
[02:10:05.597 --> 02:10:06.977]  Read the last line.
[02:10:07.257 --> 02:10:08.978]  Three years old, happening now.
[02:10:09.579 --> 02:10:12.140]  So, Colonel Schaefer is our guest here.
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:15.822]  So much to cover, such an insane time to be alive.
[02:10:16.462 --> 02:10:17.743]  What do you want to tackle first?
[02:10:18.757 --> 02:10:20.958]  Well, first off, Alex, thank you for what you're doing.
[02:10:20.998 --> 02:10:27.261]  I mean, it seems like every time we talk, we're talking about things you and I had predicted or forecast years ago.
[02:10:27.361 --> 02:10:33.924]  So, you know, kudos for you and allowing me, you know, way before the fact, a platform to talk about this.
[02:10:34.797 --> 02:10:39.300]  And secondly, thank you for what you're doing regarding continuing to hammer on the truth.
[02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:43.743]  And one thing we didn't talk about before, you know, I was over in England two weeks ago.
[02:10:43.763 --> 02:10:48.807]  I was asked to come over to talk about Brexit, about what the implications are for Brexit.
[02:10:49.127 --> 02:10:52.069]  And let me tell you, there's some folks there who are fed up with the globalists as well.
[02:10:53.450 --> 02:10:53.950]  Let's do it!
[02:11:20.967 --> 02:11:22.888]  Well, I agree with General Dunford.
[02:11:23.468 --> 02:11:34.412]  We have to understand, General Dunford being the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, we have to understand a no-fly zone at this point in time would do nothing to help secure the situation and would likely lead to another war.
[02:11:35.152 --> 02:11:41.574]  And let's remember that General Dunford, during his confirmation hearings a year and a half ago,
[02:11:42.447 --> 02:11:42.907]  I don't know.
[02:12:04.944 --> 02:12:05.284]  I think so.
[02:12:22.499 --> 02:12:27.805]  Very dangerous things which would indeed potentially get us into a shooting war with the Russians.
[02:12:28.225 --> 02:12:32.931]  And let me be clear for your audience, I don't believe for a minute that we're ready to go to war with Russia.
[02:12:33.431 --> 02:12:35.734]  I don't think they want to go to war with us.
[02:12:36.034 --> 02:12:38.457]  With that said, we are doing nothing
[02:12:39.057 --> 02:12:39.717]  We're good to go.
[02:13:03.963 --> 02:13:11.126]  President Obama and Hillary Clinton, they would be basically allowed to be trained to be in the military and go fight a war they'd probably die in.
[02:13:11.166 --> 02:13:20.709]  So, you know, it's a good way of Hillary using the Millennials in a way to get him to go to work, and I don't think it would be a good way to go to work.
[02:13:21.370 --> 02:13:21.870]  Exactly.
[02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:29.933]  And then we had a week and a half ago, General Milley, the head of the Army, say, this new war will be as big casualty-wise as World War II.
[02:13:30.753 --> 02:13:33.014]  I mean, this is just apocalyptic stuff we're hearing.
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:39.561]  Right, and General Milley, I know General Milley, he is being completely hectoric in his comments on the point.
[02:13:39.621 --> 02:13:42.542]  So we have to take a step back.
[02:13:42.782 --> 02:13:46.663]  Some of these things that are being proposed now may have worked before the Russians came in.
[02:13:46.703 --> 02:13:48.764]  Well, it's a completely different situation.
[02:13:49.364 --> 02:13:56.106]  And the other thing is this, you know, there's been reports of the offensive in Mosul kicking off, and it is going as well as can be expected.
[02:13:56.326 --> 02:13:58.406]  I'm not saying it's going, you know, swimmingly well.
[02:13:58.806 --> 02:13:59.446]  There's challenges.
[02:13:59.747 --> 02:14:00.327]  We now have 100,000 troops.
[02:14:01.827 --> 02:14:03.148]  Not, most of those are not ours.
[02:14:03.188 --> 02:14:06.530]  We're probably limited to about, we're probably at about between 10 and 15,000.
[02:14:07.311 --> 02:14:09.832]  Probably just about 15% of that, of course, is U.S.
[02:14:10.373 --> 02:14:15.016]  Fighting this effort, the Kurds, God bless them, our primary ally, doing a great job.
[02:14:15.356 --> 02:14:17.537]  The Iraqis doing a marginal job, as they have been.
[02:14:18.037 --> 02:14:21.299]  But there is progress being made to move ISIS out of Mosul.
[02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:25.142]  So I think we will, by January, have a pretty good
[02:14:27.375 --> 02:14:34.817]  Uh, understanding of how much of Iraq is back in the hands of the Iraqis or the proxies we support.
[02:14:35.077 --> 02:14:39.959]  Now, unfortunately, the proxies we don't support, the Iranians, will also have a lot of influence in Iraq, too.
[02:14:39.979 --> 02:14:42.640]  I'm not saying that Iraq's going to be a settled issue no matter what.
[02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:46.901]  I'm just saying that Iraq will be, for better or for worse, out of the control of ISIS.
[02:14:47.521 --> 02:14:50.644]  But the bottom line, Alex, is no one has a plan for Syria.
[02:14:51.044 --> 02:14:52.586]  And the plans that have been put forth by Ms.
[02:14:52.606 --> 02:14:59.092]  Clinton on her side are really dangerous and really designed to do damage to our national security.
[02:14:59.812 --> 02:15:07.319]  She wants to continue this unabated import of Islamist terror like they did in Germany and France.
[02:15:07.659 --> 02:15:11.803]  And that policy is not only dangerous, it is guaranteed to see more U.S.
[02:15:11.843 --> 02:15:12.664]  citizens die.
[02:15:14.125 --> 02:15:18.487]  I mean, of course Europe knows you bring five million in or we bring in hundreds of thousands and there's going to be a tax.
[02:15:18.787 --> 02:15:19.747]  Then why are they doing it?
[02:15:20.848 --> 02:15:31.312]  Well, the only answer I have is that knowing what's happened in Europe and that would come here, she wants to knowingly import the problems we have in Europe.
[02:15:31.372 --> 02:15:38.235]  And the reason you would do that is because you can both be the provider of the crisis and the provider of the solution to the crisis.
[02:15:38.295 --> 02:15:41.156]  Of course, their solution, Alex, as you know, is more control.
[02:15:42.857 --> 02:15:48.239]  For whatever reason, she is bent on this idea of being in charge of everything.
[02:15:48.319 --> 02:15:56.883]  And by creating a crisis like that, creating the need to protect the American people, you then can protect the American people by more control, by more onerous DHS.
[02:15:56.903 --> 02:15:57.344]  That's right.
[02:15:57.404 --> 02:16:00.885]  And then use it against the quote, alt-right she admits doesn't have a right to exist.
[02:16:00.905 --> 02:16:04.487]  She openly says in emails to her constituents, she wants to shut me down by name.
[02:16:04.827 --> 02:16:06.168]  I have no right to be on the air.
[02:16:06.228 --> 02:16:08.249]  I mean, that is so totalitarian.
[02:16:09.130 --> 02:16:09.290]  Right.
[02:16:09.671 --> 02:16:15.797]  And so, literally, this is all the use of chaos and importing chaos.
[02:16:16.177 --> 02:16:18.779]  And look, I'm a political scientist.
[02:16:18.819 --> 02:16:20.101]  I know exactly what they're trying to do.
[02:16:20.481 --> 02:16:25.286]  They're trying to create adverse circumstances that they then can come in and solve.
[02:16:25.306 --> 02:16:29.089]  This is a global version of the Munchausen-by-proxy
[02:16:33.253 --> 02:16:37.554]  And when you watch somebody with moonshots, and I've seen it personally, they don't know it's obvious to everyone.
[02:16:37.594 --> 02:16:39.634]  They just keep doing it over and over again and they can't stop.
[02:17:03.285 --> 02:17:06.366]  Right, and I think this is where the psychosis of Ms.
[02:17:06.386 --> 02:17:13.930]  Clinton and the psychosis of the entire movement is, I think most people who see it recognize it for what it is.
[02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:17.951]  Unfortunately, Alex, we have citizens who just have not woken up to the reality which we face.
[02:17:17.991 --> 02:17:23.194]  And by the way, Colonel Schaefer, obviously you're heavily involved in psychological warfare, studying all that, being able to battle Al Qaeda successfully.
[02:17:23.914 --> 02:17:29.859]  When I look at the sycophants around Hillary and the fawning, it's worse than, you know, schoolgirls around Elvis Presley.
[02:17:30.219 --> 02:17:33.822]  It's cult-like, like watching North Koreans around Kim Jong-un.
[02:17:33.862 --> 02:17:34.883]  It's very shameful.
[02:17:35.143 --> 02:17:40.468]  How did we get to this point of having a national press confirmed being run by the Democratic Party?
[02:17:41.664 --> 02:17:42.784]  Well, I think two ways.
[02:17:42.864 --> 02:17:54.067]  First, while people on the conservative side are off trying to actually do good things, I just came out of a meeting with some folks from the Reagan White House, someone who was very senior and close to President Reagan.
[02:17:55.327 --> 02:18:08.250]  We're all trying to defend the country, and it seems to me that both through institutions of higher learning and the media, the folks on the left seem to gravitate to, and I think there's a real ethical problem.
[02:18:08.710 --> 02:18:14.535]  People on the left, what I've seen, have no problem just simply making stuff up out of whole cloth.
[02:18:15.055 --> 02:18:19.439]  And for those who follow me on Facebook, I am constantly showing the hypocrisy.
[02:18:19.459 --> 02:18:22.902]  Let's talk about your Facebook, it's amazing, I'm on there all the time.
[02:18:23.342 --> 02:18:28.906]  But exactly, they're waging war against reality, they don't follow any rules, and it's all a big con game.
[02:18:28.946 --> 02:18:29.507]  Please continue.
[02:18:30.342 --> 02:18:31.223]  And that's your point.
[02:18:31.243 --> 02:18:46.371]  So they've kind of figured out this Ponzi scheme, if you will, of truth, where they try to basically obtain control and influence, and then when they get it, they use it politically for their own self-enrichment.
[02:18:46.771 --> 02:18:57.217]  And I think this is why you see this complete demunition of accountability from the media, because they look at this as a means to an end, and their end being a political
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:08.370]  Totally dangerous and insane.
[02:19:09.431 --> 02:19:16.780]  Getting into your novel, because I understand you put a lot of stuff in there that you couldn't put in a non-fiction book like your other books were non-fiction.
[02:19:18.106 --> 02:19:23.470]  I read that book three years ago, and I thought, man, I love Schaefer, but this is just a little extreme.
[02:19:23.530 --> 02:19:26.192]  Now it's like prophecy all happening.
[02:19:26.652 --> 02:19:27.493]  Tell us about the novel.
[02:19:28.499 --> 02:19:35.462]  Well, the last line was something that I recognized from both history and kind of my personal experience that things were going in a really bad direction.
[02:19:36.023 --> 02:19:43.366]  And so we actually put in there as a bad guy, you know, the Iranians, which was very controversial at the time because of what was going on regarding negotiations.
[02:19:43.946 --> 02:19:48.929]  And we put in there kind of, you know, Alex, as you said, it was kind of hard to accept
[02:19:49.509 --> 02:20:04.719]  You know, the Bohemian Grove, which by the way, I remember you're going there, about the time I was writing the book, and basically it was a metaphor for the fact that you had essentially a group of elites trying to establish control through a subterfuge, the larger mechanism of the U.S.
[02:20:04.759 --> 02:20:05.460]  government.
[02:20:05.700 --> 02:20:16.607]  Sure, I mean, I got all that, and I respected it, and I didn't poo-poo it, but the fact that they would use Islamists, not just to use them as a detonator, but actually turn us over to it, sounded crazy three years ago.
[02:20:16.927 --> 02:20:17.808]  It's happened now!
[02:20:18.638 --> 02:20:18.818]  Right.
[02:20:19.399 --> 02:20:20.399]  And so we saw the trend.
[02:20:20.419 --> 02:20:26.223]  So it's one of those things, as a political scientist, you tend to look at the history not necessarily for lessons.
[02:20:26.283 --> 02:20:34.288]  I mean, the signposts of history are there as warnings to what could happen, because it'll never apply itself exactly the same again.
[02:20:34.308 --> 02:20:40.813]  So you have to take it, Alex, as kind of like a weatherman looking at a storm front, understanding that every storm is different.
[02:20:41.073 --> 02:20:44.095]  You have to figure out how the storm's going to react when it hits mountains and things like that.
[02:20:44.135 --> 02:20:45.676]  So that's what the book was about.
[02:20:46.296 --> 02:21:02.671]  And frankly, we wrote it as a warning for people to say, look, you know, we have a very thin veneer of society, of civilization, which we all feel comfortable in, and it would not take much politically, as President Reagan warned us, for, you know, our democracy is but one generation away.
[02:21:02.711 --> 02:21:07.475]  You can peel that away very quickly, and Soros is doing that, so he can then come in and reestablish control.
[02:21:07.815 --> 02:21:09.877]  What is your official Facebook for folks that want to visit it?
[02:21:11.025 --> 02:21:16.027]  Well, it's Anthony Schaefer, and I live in Fairfax, Virginia, so you guys can go check it out.
[02:21:16.047 --> 02:21:17.967]  I have a lot of followers already.
[02:21:19.028 --> 02:21:21.909]  You and I follow each other, I believe, on Facebook, so we're there.
[02:21:21.989 --> 02:21:24.610]  And I do try very hard both on Twitter, too.
[02:21:26.025 --> 02:21:37.154]  I'm T Spooky on Twitter, and I think you and I both try very hard to point out hypocrisy, and this has been one of my biggest problems with the left.
[02:21:37.374 --> 02:21:47.682]  They seem to be very short on memories of the risks they have brought to our shores regarding their lack of accepting facts on the ground.
[02:21:47.822 --> 02:21:52.285]  Everything to them, Alex, is an extension of their political interests.
[02:21:52.486 --> 02:21:53.246]  It's all polls!
[02:21:53.286 --> 02:21:54.027]  That's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:21:54.047 --> 02:21:55.448]  She does everything according to polls.
[02:21:56.539 --> 02:21:57.199]  Right, exactly.
[02:21:57.660 --> 02:22:05.903]  So I think that's what we have to recognize is that those of us who really do wish to protect and defend the Constitution are in a constant battle with these folks on the left.
[02:22:05.963 --> 02:22:08.304]  So, the other thing is about the open borders thing.
[02:22:08.344 --> 02:22:17.348]  I mean, I cannot fathom any sane person who would understand what damage that would happen if we do that.
[02:22:18.109 --> 02:22:18.949]  The American public
[02:22:19.650 --> 02:22:28.402]  Uh, you know, the first job of the government, Alex, according to the Constitution, is to protect the common interest in common, you know, common defense, common good.
[02:22:29.083 --> 02:22:31.767]  And it is not our job to enrich Mexico.
[02:22:32.087 --> 02:22:35.191]  It is not our job to enrich people who lived south of the border.
[02:22:36.012 --> 02:22:42.839]  You know, if they want to aspire to our level of governance, of our level of civilization, that is what they should do.
[02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:45.082]  We should be a good example for them to follow.
[02:22:45.382 --> 02:22:47.264]  But that is as far as we should go.
[02:22:48.005 --> 02:22:51.408]  They have no right, nor does the government or Hillary Clinton.
[02:22:51.428 --> 02:22:54.331]  This is a fundamental attack on sovereignty by the multinationals.
[02:22:54.371 --> 02:22:57.274]  So, shifting gears then to the election.
[02:22:58.447 --> 02:23:00.249]  to what they're establishing, what they're setting up.
[02:23:00.509 --> 02:23:02.171]  WikiLeaks has her own email.
[02:23:02.191 --> 02:23:06.895]  She plans to restrict semi-autos via an executive order outside of law.
[02:23:06.976 --> 02:23:11.340]  Obama's signing us on to carbon taxes outside of congressional ratification.
[02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:13.202]  I mean, this is already naked tyranny.
[02:23:14.412 --> 02:23:14.592]  Right.
[02:23:14.993 --> 02:23:16.134]  And that's exactly to the point.
[02:23:16.154 --> 02:23:18.937]  It's like, you know, Alex, I'm fascinated.
[02:23:18.957 --> 02:23:20.339]  Just let's talk about Second Men for real quick.
[02:23:20.359 --> 02:23:22.981]  You know, I mean, in Virginia, I have a concealed carry permit.
[02:23:23.021 --> 02:23:24.123]  I can walk around with a gun.
[02:23:24.463 --> 02:23:29.208]  But, you know, I go across the Potomac River, somehow I am less qualified or competent to have a weapon.
[02:23:29.428 --> 02:23:30.590]  How can that possibly be?
[02:23:31.210 --> 02:23:37.898]  I mean, you know, I stood in combat right next to John McCain with a loaded weapon, yet somehow in Washington, D.C., I can't be trusted.
[02:23:38.398 --> 02:23:44.485]  And it's just one of those things where the complete departure of reality from Ms.
[02:23:44.505 --> 02:23:45.687]  Clinton and her ilk
[02:23:46.307 --> 02:23:47.448]  It's mind-numbing.
[02:23:47.488 --> 02:23:50.389]  I mean, look, one of the things we have to recognize is Chicago.
[02:23:50.789 --> 02:23:57.492]  Chicago has the tightest gun controls probably, you know, in the free world, and yet they have the highest amount of gun crime.
[02:23:57.552 --> 02:23:58.693]  How is it even possible?
[02:23:59.133 --> 02:24:03.915]  It's possible because the liberal issue is not about trying to make society safer.
[02:24:04.295 --> 02:24:10.258]  It's about them being in control and dictating to the people what they think they should be thinking and doing.
[02:24:10.778 --> 02:24:12.579]  And that always creates poverty.
[02:24:13.399 --> 02:24:14.760]  It always creates the same paradigm.
[02:24:15.020 --> 02:24:16.661]  Colonel Schaefer, I want to ask you this question then.
[02:24:16.681 --> 02:24:17.201]  Sure.
[02:24:17.701 --> 02:24:20.503]  I mean, I don't lionize the military, but at least the military cares.
[02:24:20.543 --> 02:24:22.124]  They sacrifice and put themselves on the line.
[02:24:22.804 --> 02:24:27.527]  On average, our military especially, is the most awake group out there.
[02:24:27.607 --> 02:24:28.687]  Then police get demonized.
[02:24:28.707 --> 02:24:29.408]  They've got problems.
[02:24:29.688 --> 02:24:30.448]  They've got a rough job.
[02:24:30.508 --> 02:24:32.509]  But on average, they're more awake than the general public.
[02:24:33.150 --> 02:24:39.273]  And so I see Soros and the Globalists openly trying to start a civil war in this country, saying under strong cities,
[02:24:40.373 --> 02:24:40.913]  The U.N.
[02:24:40.953 --> 02:24:43.155]  is going to come in and basically run our local departments.
[02:24:43.435 --> 02:24:44.395]  That's not me saying it.
[02:24:44.435 --> 02:24:45.516]  That's the Washington Post.
[02:24:45.856 --> 02:24:47.337]  This is so Twilight Zone.
[02:24:47.797 --> 02:24:51.719]  But I think they've jumped the shark in their attempt to demonize the military and police.
[02:24:51.799 --> 02:24:57.803]  I think at a core level now, they've really begun to lose the propaganda battle when they made that move.
[02:24:57.823 --> 02:25:05.027]  Can you comment to that and talk about basically the mood, the understanding in the actual guardians of this republic?
[02:25:06.075 --> 02:25:07.416]  Well, let me answer from two sides.
[02:25:07.477 --> 02:25:09.138]  I have some very close friends in law enforcement.
[02:25:09.158 --> 02:25:11.541]  One of them is a sheriff in one of the local counties.
[02:25:12.201 --> 02:25:16.826]  And I can tell you that he's got a sizable number of black officers.
[02:25:16.846 --> 02:25:18.948]  And I can tell you, it's not about black lives.
[02:25:19.169 --> 02:25:22.132]  I mean, I stood recently with one of his black officers.
[02:25:22.172 --> 02:25:23.073]  We were talking about this.
[02:25:24.033 --> 02:25:29.915]  At an event, and we have to understand that law enforcement's job is to protect the interests of the American people, period.
[02:25:30.895 --> 02:25:38.237]  And the folks in the Hillary Clinton side are making it very tough because they are supporting the idea of chaos and destruction.
[02:25:38.617 --> 02:25:46.839]  And let's be blunt here, the Black Lives Movement is not about protecting lives, it's about attacking law enforcement and diminishing their ability to keep law and order.
[02:25:47.498 --> 02:25:48.479]  This extends to the military.
[02:25:48.499 --> 02:25:50.642]  The military's job is to protect and defend the Constitution.
[02:25:50.662 --> 02:25:57.570]  So isn't this classical sedition that we have foreign multinationals like Soros trying to openly create a false revolution in the US?
[02:25:57.590 --> 02:26:02.836]  Because the whole revolution in Ukraine that overthrew an elected government was an anti-police movement at first.
[02:26:02.896 --> 02:26:04.318]  I mean, this is very seditious.
[02:26:05.359 --> 02:26:05.499]  Right.
[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:06.760]  Well, that's the thing, too.
[02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:07.761]  And going to the military, then.
[02:26:07.781 --> 02:26:16.170]  So, the military now is becoming more and more burdened as a social experimentation, like a petri dish, rather than doing its job.
[02:26:16.230 --> 02:26:18.312]  Red high heels on the soldiers.
[02:26:19.471 --> 02:26:24.475]  I mean, the Secretary of the Navy, Mabus, said yesterday his job is to make people feel better about their selves.
[02:26:24.515 --> 02:26:25.416]  Like, are you kidding me?
[02:26:26.297 --> 02:26:35.184]  The Secretary of the Navy's job is to have the best, most capable Navy in the world that defend the interests of the American people and the people itself.
[02:26:35.605 --> 02:26:37.827]  It's not to make sure that someone... This is sabotage.
[02:26:37.907 --> 02:26:40.769]  ...wants to wear high heels, feels more comfortable, and doing that in public.
[02:26:40.789 --> 02:26:41.890]  That is not the Navy's job.
[02:26:42.451 --> 02:26:44.833]  So why are they sabotaging the military?
[02:26:45.737 --> 02:26:46.977]  Well, that's the point, Alex.
[02:26:46.997 --> 02:26:56.119]  They're using, they keep trying to make, to put these onerous social requirements on the military to make it less able to fight and win a war.
[02:26:57.080 --> 02:26:58.980]  While they're trying to start a war with the Russians.
[02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:00.240]  Exactly.
[02:27:00.721 --> 02:27:05.042]  Which is designed then to make us not only effective, but probably make us fail, and fail miserably.
[02:27:05.122 --> 02:27:07.942]  So, they're really, it's really the worst of both worlds.
[02:27:07.982 --> 02:27:15.104]  You have this social experimentation going on, which really does diminish readiness, creates friction within the ranks,
[02:27:15.784 --> 02:27:26.030]  It takes the military away from its primary mission, which is to fight and win wars, and at the same time, then, they're trying to put us in a position where we have to fight a war, and at the very time we're less able.
[02:27:26.090 --> 02:27:39.197]  So, it's really something that I think the American public has to recognize, that the social experimentation the military has been forced into is not helping protect them, or make them stronger, or ensure that we're going to win any war we get pulled into.
[02:27:39.697 --> 02:27:43.339]  Tony-Shafer.com, LondonCenter.org, you can also follow him on Facebook.
[02:27:44.204 --> 02:27:49.025]  Looking at this, and we've got a lot of the WikiLeaks showing it, it's like multinationals playing countries off against each other.
[02:27:49.305 --> 02:27:56.326]  I'm not saying Hillary's an actual Russian agent, but she's on the payroll of the Russians, Podesta got $35 million, and was actually getting orders from Putin's office.
[02:27:56.627 --> 02:27:57.747]  They then blamed Trump for that.
[02:27:58.067 --> 02:28:02.408]  But for all intents and purposes, Hillary's a chaos agent that makes money off chaos.
[02:28:03.168 --> 02:28:08.449]  So, for all intents and purposes, she is basically an agent to bring this country down.
[02:28:09.756 --> 02:28:19.009]  Well, you know, I think that that's the inevitable result of the policies which she's put forward, and we now see being postulated as what she will do.
[02:28:19.470 --> 02:28:21.793]  And Alex, this is one of the things that Donald Trump's been very clear about.
[02:28:21.813 --> 02:28:25.238]  I do believe that no matter how you feel about Trump,
[02:28:25.998 --> 02:28:28.100]  And, you know, he's gone back and forth on some issues.
[02:28:29.020 --> 02:28:31.081]  I sincerely believe that Ms.
[02:28:31.121 --> 02:28:43.029]  Clinton will do exactly what she said regarding open borders, regarding attempting to gain control and prevent, you know, legitimate citizens having legitimate rights to have weapons from having them.
[02:28:43.069 --> 02:28:43.709]  That's right.
[02:28:43.729 --> 02:28:46.791]  Hillary wants to complete the takeover, so Trump's now a figurehead.
[02:28:46.971 --> 02:28:48.112]  He's not out to get America.
[02:28:48.332 --> 02:28:51.374]  Whatever crap they dig up, as long as it's not illegal, I'm ignoring it.
[02:28:51.594 --> 02:28:52.735]  We're kicking the globalists out.
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:55.201]  Right, and that's the way I'm looking at it as well.
[02:28:55.661 --> 02:29:05.068]  And especially when you look at Alex, and this is something else I agree with Mr. Trump on, if you look at her record, you know, you look at her 30 years of service, yeah, all of it's bad.
[02:29:05.128 --> 02:29:06.088]  All of it's failure.
[02:29:06.529 --> 02:29:13.233]  And I don't think anybody can look at her record and actually find something that's been successful for the American people.
[02:29:13.734 --> 02:29:19.578]  And the only thing she's done, Alex, if you look at it, she's created havoc and chaos in every possible way.
[02:29:19.598 --> 02:29:20.759]  For her own gain.
[02:29:21.619 --> 02:29:21.819]  Right.
[02:29:22.139 --> 02:29:27.462]  So, for personal gain, which is very clearly they have, so you have to ask yourself, who is Ms.
[02:29:27.502 --> 02:29:28.983]  Clinton really trying to help?
[02:29:29.323 --> 02:29:30.924]  And it is most certainly not the American people.
[02:29:30.944 --> 02:29:31.164]  All right.
[02:29:31.245 --> 02:29:33.266]  Colonel Shaver, thank you so much for the time.
[02:29:33.286 --> 02:29:36.507]  Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaver, promise you'll come back more than once or twice a year.
[02:29:36.548 --> 02:29:37.108]  We always love it.
[02:29:37.128 --> 02:29:37.388]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:29:37.408 --> 02:29:37.728]  Yeah, let me know.
[02:29:37.748 --> 02:29:38.689]  I'll be happy to join you again.
[02:29:38.949 --> 02:29:39.549]  Thank you, sir.
[02:29:39.609 --> 02:29:39.929]  God bless.
[02:29:39.969 --> 02:29:40.610]  Have a great weekend.
[02:29:40.630 --> 02:29:41.850]  I hope we don't have nuclear war with the Russians.
[02:29:42.111 --> 02:29:43.091]  That is such a patriot.
[02:29:43.111 --> 02:29:44.132]  That guy is so good.
[02:29:44.152 --> 02:29:46.133]  One of the main guys that exposed Benghazi.
[02:29:46.513 --> 02:29:47.294]  I mean, they already know it.
[02:29:47.314 --> 02:29:49.055]  They've already gone after him for it, so you might as well get the credit.
[02:29:50.215 --> 02:29:50.816]  We'll be back.
[02:29:51.516 --> 02:29:52.837]  They're going after James O'Keefe.
[02:29:52.917 --> 02:29:54.359]  I mean, this is like emergency around here.
[02:29:54.639 --> 02:29:56.240]  I gotta go find out what's going on during this break.
[02:29:56.280 --> 02:29:57.942]  I mean, let's just reach crazy town level.
[02:29:58.922 --> 02:29:59.823]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.304 --> 02:30:01.905]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:02.846 --> 02:30:05.528]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.191 --> 02:30:14.073]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:14.353 --> 02:30:21.636]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[02:30:21.816 --> 02:30:32.841]  The all-new Vitamin Mineral Fusion drink mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[02:30:33.282 --> 02:30:40.851]  In the history of InfoWars life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[02:30:41.091 --> 02:30:50.443]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:30:50.743 --> 02:30:54.948]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:30:55.189 --> 02:31:01.897]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:31:02.258 --> 02:31:03.399]  That means it's clean.
[02:31:03.719 --> 02:31:04.781]  That means it's pure.
[02:31:04.881 --> 02:31:07.644]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:31:07.805 --> 02:31:09.487]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:31:10.097 --> 02:31:10.597]  I do not agree.
[02:31:10.657 --> 02:31:12.059]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:31:12.099 --> 02:31:13.180]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:31:13.420 --> 02:31:14.341]  Why is this so good?
[02:31:14.641 --> 02:31:19.885]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:31:19.965 --> 02:31:33.516]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:31:33.576 --> 02:31:34.958]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:31:35.718 --> 02:31:37.319]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:31:37.379 --> 02:31:39.861]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:31:39.961 --> 02:31:41.222]  These are all parasites.
[02:31:41.262 --> 02:31:42.362]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:31:42.382 --> 02:31:43.443]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:31:43.735 --> 02:31:48.057]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:31:48.257 --> 02:31:51.378]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:31:51.538 --> 02:31:54.599]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:31:54.619 --> 02:31:55.639]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:31:55.679 --> 02:31:57.560]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:57.620 --> 02:31:58.640]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:31:58.660 --> 02:32:00.721]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:32:01.381 --> 02:32:03.222]  And you support the broadcast.
[02:32:03.302 --> 02:32:04.382]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:04.642 --> 02:32:06.543]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:06.923 --> 02:32:08.884]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:32:11.326 --> 02:32:11.586]  U.S.
[02:32:11.626 --> 02:32:19.790]  intelligence and law enforcement officials are again coming out and warning of Russian interference in the United States presidential election, but this time in a different tone.
[02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:31.216]  Now the intelligence agencies say Russian hackers will undermine the upcoming election by posting documents online reporting to show evidence that election fraud had happened and that Russia is hacking voter registration bases.
[02:32:31.676 --> 02:32:40.680]  They went on to say that the election is so large it is impossible for a hacker to change the outcome, so instead Russia will just resort to reporting election fraud online, fraudulently.
[02:32:41.060 --> 02:32:42.820]  State and local authorities have been warned.
[02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:47.762]  So wait a second, we have mass amounts of evidence of voter fraud piling up almost daily, we have U.S.
[02:32:47.822 --> 02:32:54.325]  officials warning of Russian interference, but Obama has never heard of a rigged election, and Trump is crazy for monitoring the results.
[02:32:54.465 --> 02:32:59.607]  The truth is, they've been caught trying to rig the election, so they are distracting and diverting the blame to Russia.
[02:32:59.807 --> 02:33:04.351]  So now every time you see election fraud happening, it doesn't exist, and it's Russia's fault.
[02:33:04.371 --> 02:33:06.153]  This is Owen Schroer from InfoWars.com.
[02:33:06.193 --> 02:33:06.774]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:08.816 --> 02:33:10.998]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.254 --> 02:33:24.537]  Mainstream corporate media has done a lot of stupid stuff lately.
[02:33:24.978 --> 02:33:27.200]  Their ratings have gone down to almost nothing.
[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:28.541]  And what are they doing?
[02:33:28.561 --> 02:33:29.642]  They're doubling down.
[02:33:30.443 --> 02:33:42.655]  They've now come out and told the American people that there's no such thing as election fraud and that nobody's ever been concerned about it in history, thinking we all have the memory of a goldfish.
[02:33:47.751 --> 02:33:48.651]  Keep emphasizing it.
[02:33:48.791 --> 02:33:50.311]  Florida, the polls have closed.
[02:33:50.752 --> 02:33:52.652]  Florida goes for Al Gore.
[02:33:53.152 --> 02:33:56.653]  If we say somebody has carried the state, you can pretty much take it to the bank.
[02:33:57.173 --> 02:33:58.293]  Book it, if that's true.
[02:33:58.913 --> 02:34:00.873]  Speaker of the House of Florida was Tom Feeney.
[02:34:00.993 --> 02:34:02.534]  One of my first introductions to him.
[02:34:03.054 --> 02:34:06.194]  And he wanted us to build a vote-flipping software.
[02:34:06.454 --> 02:34:11.095]  It takes only a few seconds to insert a computer virus into this voting machine.
[02:34:11.335 --> 02:34:14.896]  I stand by CNN right now is moving
[02:34:15.778 --> 02:34:21.818]  Our earlier declaration of Florida back to the too close to call column.
[02:34:23.098 --> 02:34:33.140]  ...of asking the Attorney General to pursue criminal and civil actions against Diebold in this matter, based on findings of fraudulent actions.
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:35.560]  You didn't have to sit across the street in a truck.
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:38.741]  You could just sit there and punch a button, and the votes all flipped.
[02:34:38.961 --> 02:34:41.621]  George Bush is the President-elect of the United States.
[02:34:41.681 --> 02:34:44.122]  He has won the state of Florida, according to our projections.
[02:34:44.402 --> 02:34:50.183]  The effort I have underway is simply to make sure that all the votes are counted.
[02:34:50.703 --> 02:34:57.691]  Our presidential election came down to one state where the brother of the man running for president was the governor of the state.
[02:34:57.711 --> 02:35:02.015]  Here's my boy.
[02:35:05.759 --> 02:35:11.966]  According to the Washington Post, early evening exit polls pointed to a decisive win for Kerry.
[02:35:12.551 --> 02:35:21.355]  Apparently what has happened is that the Associated Press, they were feeding numbers into us and then suddenly those numbers changed.
[02:35:21.735 --> 02:35:23.356]  First of all, we want to find out what happened.
[02:35:23.836 --> 02:35:32.400]  The leaked data revealed that in critical states, Kerry was ahead in the exit polls in 10 of the 12 swing states.
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:37.323]  What I'm telling you is that the numbers changed and sometimes these things happen.
[02:35:37.343 --> 02:35:41.625]  And hundreds of thousands of votes shift not in a
[02:35:43.246 --> 02:35:52.989]  Progressive, incremental way, but in this almost complete, sudden, violent reversal.
[02:35:53.329 --> 02:35:59.031]  This last Friday night, I arranged to meet Senator Kerry at a fundraiser to give him a copy of my book.
[02:35:59.631 --> 02:36:01.892]  He told me he now thinks the election was stolen.
[02:36:02.472 --> 02:36:09.014]  He said he doesn't believe that he's the person who can go out front on the issue because of the sour grapes, you know, question.
[02:36:09.714 --> 02:36:11.535]  But he said he believes it was stolen.
[02:36:12.295 --> 02:36:15.657]  He says he argues about this with his Democratic colleagues on the Hill.
[02:36:15.677 --> 02:36:18.058]  He had just had a big fight with Christopher Dodd about it.
[02:36:18.618 --> 02:36:20.899]  Because he said, this is stuff about the voting machines.
[02:36:20.939 --> 02:36:21.980]  They're really questionable.
[02:36:22.620 --> 02:36:24.001]  And Dodd was angry.
[02:36:24.461 --> 02:36:25.302]  I don't want to hear about it.
[02:36:25.702 --> 02:36:26.282]  I've looked into it.
[02:36:26.322 --> 02:36:27.102]  There's nothing there.
[02:36:27.503 --> 02:36:28.643]  Well, there's plenty there.
[02:36:29.123 --> 02:36:38.308]  I raise this objection because I am convinced that we as a body must conduct a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities.
[02:36:39.088 --> 02:36:44.990]  I raise this objection to debate the process and protect the integrity of the true will of the people.
[02:36:45.210 --> 02:36:53.073]  So we do move into the 2008 election cycle with many of the same problems we had going all the way back to 2000 and the fiasco in Florida.
[02:36:53.513 --> 02:37:01.656]  Some electronic voting machines in West Virginia were selecting McCain when voters actually punched Obama.
[02:37:01.776 --> 02:37:01.976]  Yep.
[02:37:02.396 --> 02:37:05.537]  Smartmatic and other voting machine companies are private companies.
[02:37:05.917 --> 02:37:09.838]  They have proprietary software they can call a trade secret.
[02:37:10.138 --> 02:37:20.401]  Even the New York Times indicated last week that over 30% of the ACORN registrations are bogus fraud or fake.
[02:37:20.781 --> 02:37:25.883]  And that should be disconcerting to anyone who cares about free and fair elections.
[02:37:26.403 --> 02:37:31.505]  The concern is that these fraudulent registrations are going to lead to fraudulent voting.
[02:37:31.925 --> 02:37:42.090]  And in a close race, whether it be in Ohio or Nevada or elsewhere, this is where this Acorn scandal, I think, is going to have a potentially explosive impact on Election Day.
[02:37:42.590 --> 02:37:48.012]  But of most concern, of course, are the separate computer systems that count and report actual votes.
[02:37:48.513 --> 02:37:51.734]  So far, no sign that any of those have been compromised.
[02:37:52.134 --> 02:37:53.955]  The Lapel conducted a demonstration
[02:37:54.315 --> 02:38:01.237]  Where he actually changed the votes in the machine by swapping out the machine's computer chip for one that he programmed.
[02:38:01.597 --> 02:38:10.260]  This black box is unaccountable, untestable, privately run software from the two companies that you have hired to count our votes.
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:16.343]  So when the votes come out of this black box, they do not reflect the New York City or the national votes.
[02:38:16.763 --> 02:38:21.246]  In 22 primaries, the votes have shifted in 20 of them.
[02:38:21.926 --> 02:38:23.687]  The exit polling data in New York State shifted 12%.
[02:38:23.747 --> 02:38:24.748]  A shift of 2% is fraud!
[02:38:27.310 --> 02:38:28.091]  According to the U.S.
[02:38:28.111 --> 02:38:30.832]  State Department, because that's what we've seen across the country.
[02:38:31.173 --> 02:38:38.498]  I figured out how to make a slightly different computer program that just before the close of the polls, it shifts some votes around from one candidate to another.
[02:38:38.918 --> 02:38:47.664]  The work we did to prepare for Hillary Clinton to be our nominee and then make sure that we could get her elected president is absolutely critical to advancing the issues.
[02:38:47.904 --> 02:38:50.065]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[02:38:50.145 --> 02:38:50.886]  What does that mean?
[02:38:53.613 --> 02:39:01.778]  Thank you for showing concern for the integrity of our election system here in the United States, because the fate of this nation affects the rest of the world.
[02:39:02.739 --> 02:39:07.021]  Now, election fraud throughout history has been well documented.
[02:39:07.782 --> 02:39:17.408]  And the fact that the mainstream media tries to act like that Donald Trump is crazy, that he's been raising it, shows just how disconnected the mainstream media is.
[02:39:17.808 --> 02:39:22.811]  Donald Trump's biggest lie is about the election itself, the integrity of the election.
[02:39:23.511 --> 02:39:25.472]  He is alleging a massive conspiracy.
[02:39:25.712 --> 02:39:30.014]  Somewhere between 2 and 5 percent of illegal voters vote.
[02:39:30.054 --> 02:39:33.956]  Stop, stop, stop, or I'm going to have to cut this interview short.
[02:39:34.257 --> 02:39:35.737]  You don't want people to hear the evidence?
[02:39:35.777 --> 02:39:36.938]  It's not facts.
[02:39:37.098 --> 02:39:41.400]  I have presented the evidence to my viewers, and my viewers trust me to tell them the truth.
[02:39:41.700 --> 02:39:42.741]  We've cited studies.
[02:39:43.001 --> 02:39:45.782]  I've talked to Secretaries of State who are Republicans.
[02:39:46.023 --> 02:39:48.544]  I've talked to many Republican officials who say there's not widespread fraud.
[02:39:48.564 --> 02:39:49.404]  Secretaries of State are elected.
[02:39:49.424 --> 02:39:50.545]  They're part of the system.
[02:39:51.025 --> 02:40:06.395]  Back in August, InfoWars first raised this issue because we had seen the Democratic Party steal the nomination from Bernie Sanders and the Republican Party had just tried to do the same thing with Donald Trump unsuccessfully because Trump fought back against it.
[02:40:06.976 --> 02:40:17.283]  So I put out an emergency message to Donald Trump and I told him personally that I thought it was very important for him to raise the alarm that we the people would be watching this election very, very closely.
[02:40:17.623 --> 02:40:20.765]  And Trump told me he absolutely agreed and he was already on it.
[02:40:21.465 --> 02:40:27.128]  They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths, where so many cities are corrupt.
[02:40:27.248 --> 02:40:27.868]  And you see that?
[02:40:28.188 --> 02:40:29.909]  The system, folks, is rigged.
[02:40:29.969 --> 02:40:30.690]  First of all, it's rigged.
[02:40:31.290 --> 02:40:33.031]  And I'm afraid the election's going to be rigged.
[02:40:33.051 --> 02:40:33.731]  I have to be honest.
[02:40:34.231 --> 02:40:39.074]  Regardless of what you think about Donald Trump, this is about the integrity of our elections.
[02:40:40.034 --> 02:40:43.996]  Clearly, the 2000 election was stolen from Al Gore, and I was no fan of Gore.
[02:40:44.056 --> 02:40:49.779]  But at the time, we broke that down and had experts on, like Bev Harris of Black Box Voting, to prove it.
[02:40:50.666 --> 02:40:57.150]  She then went on to help produce and direct the award-winning HBO documentary, Hacking Democracy.
[02:40:57.490 --> 02:40:57.970]  Okay, we're in.
[02:40:57.990 --> 02:41:00.812]  Now, this is the official program that the county supervisor sees.
[02:41:01.152 --> 02:41:05.135]  As we can see here, Howard Dean has 1,000 votes, and Lex Luthor has 500.
[02:41:05.695 --> 02:41:07.956]  So you're beating Lex Luthor, and we're... Two to one.
[02:41:08.116 --> 02:41:08.336]  Yes.
[02:41:08.697 --> 02:41:10.958]  And Tiger Woods, unfortunately, doesn't have any votes yet.
[02:41:11.018 --> 02:41:11.358]  All right.
[02:41:11.758 --> 02:41:17.162]  Go to Central Tabulator Votes, and then go to the sum of the candidates, which is that table.
[02:41:17.902 --> 02:41:21.665]  You see, we have 800 votes here for you and 400 for Lex Luthor.
[02:41:21.685 --> 02:41:22.545]  Let's just flip those.
[02:41:22.846 --> 02:41:23.366]  We'll make that 400.
[02:41:23.726 --> 02:41:27.409]  And we'll give 100 votes to Tiger.
[02:41:27.749 --> 02:41:29.470]  Let's just see what happened here.
[02:41:29.511 --> 02:41:31.552]  We'll go back into Jim's The Legitimate Way.
[02:41:32.052 --> 02:41:35.355]  And as you can see now, Howard Dean only has 500 votes.
[02:41:35.535 --> 02:41:38.917]  Lex Luthor has 900, and Tiger Woods has 100 votes.
[02:41:38.977 --> 02:41:40.699]  We just edited an election.
[02:41:40.759 --> 02:41:41.779]  It took us 90 seconds.
[02:41:41.859 --> 02:41:44.001]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[02:41:44.101 --> 02:41:44.882]  What does that mean?
[02:41:45.362 --> 02:41:46.263]  Laid out before me.
[02:41:47.225 --> 02:42:00.330]  Is just a small sampling of mainstream news, video clips, C-SPAN, Hillary's own words, John Kerry's own words, Al Gore's own words, certified cases of fraud in Ohio against John Kerry.
[02:42:00.650 --> 02:42:02.110]  I mean, this is all gone on.
[02:42:02.451 --> 02:42:03.311]  This is all on record.
[02:42:03.959 --> 02:42:13.846]  And again, how does the media sit there with a straight face, ask Donald Trump if he's concerned about the election process, and then act like he's crazy because he is?
[02:42:14.186 --> 02:42:20.471]  Clearly the headline, Donald Trump saying he may not accept the result of this presidential election.
[02:42:20.831 --> 02:42:23.994]  One of the most stunning things I've ever heard in a presidential debate ever.
[02:42:24.875 --> 02:42:34.185]  And to say that he, to suggest that he might not accept the results of the election that we're about to hold in fewer than three weeks was staggering.
[02:42:35.086 --> 02:42:36.888]  And I don't think it helped him.
[02:42:37.148 --> 02:42:40.531]  If liberals really are liberals, then they have to have a memory.
[02:42:41.564 --> 02:42:50.007]  Be cogent, be honest, and not lie to themselves and everybody else and act like Trump's really stepped in it because he talked about the elephant in the room.
[02:42:50.387 --> 02:43:03.311]  The latest piece of information we have about how our republic and our right to vote is being undermined is from the FBI, not even WikiLeaks, with the big data dump they put out last week where a shadow government, that's their words, or a seventh floor
[02:43:04.111 --> 02:43:08.776]  ...is shielding Hillary from prosecution by the FBI and the bureaucracy.
[02:43:09.056 --> 02:43:11.678]  So we already have an unelected group running the nation.
[02:43:12.319 --> 02:43:29.035]  During the final debate in Vegas, Donald Trump raised the fact that Pew Research had a new report this year showing more than 20 million fraudulent voter registrations in the United States and over 4 million people that are either dead or who have been registered to vote repeatedly.
[02:43:29.535 --> 02:43:31.676]  Let me give you some numbers to really bring that home.
[02:43:32.137 --> 02:43:37.380]  According to Pew, 24 million people, one of every eight, voter registrations in the U.S.
[02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:40.922]  are no longer valid or significantly inaccurate.
[02:43:41.422 --> 02:43:45.625]  More than 1.8 million dead people are listed as voters.
[02:43:46.506 --> 02:43:48.207]  So you could use that name, go ahead and vote.
[02:43:48.347 --> 02:43:54.631]  Approximately 2.75 million people, two and three quarter million people, are registered in more than one state.
[02:43:55.131 --> 02:43:57.953]  What we're fighting here is what George Orwell called double think.
[02:43:58.533 --> 02:44:05.298]  Where you can hold two separate ideas in your mind at the same time that are completely in opposition to each other, but believe both of them.
[02:44:05.658 --> 02:44:06.839]  And that's what we've seen from Obama.
[02:44:07.219 --> 02:44:13.184]  He comes out and counters myself and Trump a few months ago and says there's no such thing as election fraud.
[02:44:13.484 --> 02:44:14.785]  Nobody's ever heard of that.
[02:44:16.546 --> 02:44:18.748]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[02:44:18.828 --> 02:44:19.589]  What does that mean?
[02:44:22.891 --> 02:44:26.374]  The federal government doesn't run the election process.
[02:44:27.871 --> 02:44:31.953]  States and cities and communities all across the country.
[02:44:32.853 --> 02:44:43.298]  They're the ones who set up the voting systems and the voting booths and if Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is
[02:44:45.339 --> 02:44:49.063]  There are some short-term, long-term things I think that we should do to
[02:45:02.581 --> 02:45:04.743]  Bolster the cybersecurity around the election process.
[02:45:06.164 --> 02:45:13.189]  I am considering communicating with election officials across the country about best practices.
[02:45:13.689 --> 02:45:17.472]  And Obama continues to come out every couple days saying there's no such thing as election fraud.
[02:45:17.932 --> 02:45:18.993]  Quit whining Trump.
[02:45:19.653 --> 02:45:26.158]  And then the next night at the debate, Hillary comes out and says that the Russians are trying to take over the election yet again with no proof.
[02:45:26.878 --> 02:45:32.362]  Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.
[02:45:32.942 --> 02:45:40.307]  They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions.
[02:45:40.687 --> 02:45:47.152]  Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.
[02:45:47.532 --> 02:45:53.076]  This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly from Putin himself, in an effort
[02:45:53.616 --> 02:45:59.399]  As 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed to influence our election.
[02:45:59.619 --> 02:46:03.440]  So there's no election fraud whenever Donald Trump raises the concern.
[02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:13.125]  It's never happened in history, but simultaneously in the same speeches, we're told our election is in great peril and the Democrat-controlled DHS has to take it over.
[02:46:13.625 --> 02:46:22.409]  And we now have Hillary's chief of staff, Podesta, caught in new WikiLeaks emails trying to grease the skids for illegal aliens to vote and get driver's license.
[02:46:23.149 --> 02:46:24.850]  And then it only gets more flagrant.
[02:46:25.430 --> 02:46:45.958]  Project Veritas, with James O'Keefe, in a year-long investigation, has top Democratic Party operatives, national heads of major organizations, on video, saying, we're gonna bust people in to vote over and over again, and there's nothing anybody can do, because we control the media, we control the courts.
[02:46:46.058 --> 02:46:51.720]  I mean, this is like something out of a Perry Mason movie, where they are literally shaking like criminals, saying,
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:53.082]  The world is ours.
[02:46:53.422 --> 02:46:54.964]  We're taking over the legislatures.
[02:46:55.325 --> 02:46:56.466]  Nobody can stop us.
[02:46:57.287 --> 02:47:00.612]  I mean, in Hollywood movies, this would bring down the whole criminal enterprise.
[02:47:01.133 --> 02:47:07.001]  But not in America, not in the real world, because the media and the courts are so controlled, and the criminals know that.
[02:47:07.967 --> 02:47:13.210]  If you're there and you're protesting and you do these actions, you will be attacked at Trump rallies.
[02:47:13.230 --> 02:47:14.331]  That's what we know.
[02:47:14.711 --> 02:47:18.333]  Oh, so that's part of the process of eliciting the reaction.
[02:47:18.373 --> 02:47:26.318]  The whole point of it is we know that Trump's people will freak the f**k out, his security team will freak out, and his supporters will lose their s**t.
[02:47:27.892 --> 02:47:28.252]  I think so.
[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:56.862]  A, the mainstream corporate media is totally blacking out the reports he's putting out that are the biggest in their storied history.
[02:47:57.082 --> 02:48:05.644]  He has top Democratic officials, top operatives saying, we're stealing elections, we're engaged in election fraud, we're busting people around, we're gonna do it, we're above the law.
[02:48:05.724 --> 02:48:09.245]  We're trending on Twitter, we're the number one trending video on YouTube worldwide.
[02:48:09.705 --> 02:48:11.706]  We're the number one trending thing on Facebook.
[02:48:12.662 --> 02:48:13.122]  We're good to go.
[02:48:34.580 --> 02:48:45.726]  All Americans, regardless of race, color, creed, political persuasion, need to support Trump as a referendum against the corporate fascism we see taking root in this nation.
[02:48:46.486 --> 02:48:48.868]  Major polls and studies are conclusive.
[02:48:49.308 --> 02:48:54.431]  The vast majority of Americans, over 70%, no matter what race, color, or creed,
[02:48:55.431 --> 02:49:01.597]  Believe that there is major election and voter fraud happening in this country and they want IDs to be used to be able to vote.
[02:49:02.057 --> 02:49:02.878]  It's just that simple.
[02:49:03.738 --> 02:49:10.845]  If you have any integrity as a so-called Democrat, or anybody else for that matter, you should be outraged by the media trying to lie to you.
[02:49:11.585 --> 02:49:20.489]  And act like Donald Trump is a kook or a crazy person when he has the courage to talk about the fact that they're clearly trying to steal the election.
[02:49:20.829 --> 02:49:28.852]  The media piling on, the disinformation, all the fake polls, Reuters and CNN have been caught in, where they sample way more Democrats than Republicans.
[02:49:29.272 --> 02:49:31.753]  This is unprecedented corruption.
[02:49:32.353 --> 02:49:35.595]  And to see the media so persecuted by Obama and Hillary,
[02:49:36.315 --> 02:49:44.157]  Lined up like sycophantic minions, throwing themselves at them in their disdain of the American people is truly despicable.
[02:49:44.617 --> 02:49:49.598]  Hillary, her minions and controllers are on megalomaniac power trips right now.
[02:49:50.419 --> 02:49:51.639]  And history is repeating itself.
[02:49:52.039 --> 02:49:55.660]  They're saying they want to persecute the alt-right press.
[02:49:56.340 --> 02:50:00.861]  Well, folks, if you let the alt-right press get shut down today, it's going to be you tomorrow.
[02:50:01.681 --> 02:50:04.002]  Where are the real liberals out there?
[02:50:04.910 --> 02:50:05.871]  Or do you not exist?
[02:50:06.771 --> 02:50:15.258]  Are you on too big of a power trip imagining this huge utopia that we're gonna have once you're in full control and all the opposition's been silenced?
[02:50:16.138 --> 02:50:22.163]  And I got the chance to meet the people who are working so hard to get her elected.
[02:50:24.884 --> 02:50:25.605]  There they are.
[02:50:27.066 --> 02:50:28.147]  The heads of NBC, CNN,
[02:50:31.778 --> 02:50:38.040]  CBS, ABC, there's the New York Times right over there, and the Washington Post.
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:47.102]  We have to keep putting out a message, and we need to call on everybody to speak out about the fact that we run elections, and we run them well here.
[02:50:47.482 --> 02:50:48.002]  You know what?
[02:50:48.042 --> 02:50:54.104]  We've been busting people in for 50 years, and we're not going to stop now.
[02:50:54.424 --> 02:50:59.745]  There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that
[02:51:01.095 --> 02:51:04.879]  You could even rig America's elections.
[02:51:05.420 --> 02:51:11.126]  And so, I'd invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.
[02:51:11.166 --> 02:51:11.326]  So...
[02:51:15.842 --> 02:51:20.125]  The Russians are gonna rig it, so they gotta federalize it to keep it safe, but the feds aren't involved.
[02:51:20.706 --> 02:51:23.368]  I don't know what to call that special report to get the most traction.
[02:51:23.468 --> 02:51:26.190]  New Veritas video, because it's a lot of their video together.
[02:51:27.291 --> 02:51:30.173]  This video proves Donald Trump is absolutely correct about election fraud.
[02:51:30.934 --> 02:51:32.515]  They're posting it right now on InfoWars.com.
[02:51:32.555 --> 02:51:33.516]  They're gonna red link it.
[02:51:34.297 --> 02:51:35.558]  You need to make this thing go viral.
[02:51:35.598 --> 02:51:36.498]  It's Friday afternoon.
[02:51:37.585 --> 02:51:41.508]  We don't want to release it on Friday afternoons, it's not one of the better times, but that's just when news breaks, it's happening.
[02:51:41.969 --> 02:51:48.435]  I basically took all the research we've done, the research you saw on Drudge yesterday, with all the admissions of election fraud by Democrats, and put it in a video.
[02:51:49.796 --> 02:51:54.480]  And I was working on a video also that deals with their claims they're going to start World War III when all the experts say it's Hillary.
[02:51:55.020 --> 02:51:57.943]  Just heard Colonel Schaefer on, breaking that down as well.
[02:51:58.904 --> 02:52:03.568]  Not your average colonel, obviously, involved in black ops and a lot of other things.
[02:52:05.848 --> 02:52:07.649]  The military does not want to have a war with Russia.
[02:52:07.689 --> 02:52:09.670]  It's trying to restrain Obama and Hillary right now.
[02:52:09.690 --> 02:52:14.353]  And I'm not lionizing the military in some butt-kissing maneuver.
[02:52:14.393 --> 02:52:15.854]  That's who's been holding all this back.
[02:52:17.895 --> 02:52:20.597]  Because the political elite is so disconnected from reality.
[02:52:20.997 --> 02:52:22.518]  That's what Schaefer kept hammering.
[02:52:23.299 --> 02:52:25.740]  The video's going up on Infowars.com as we speak.
[02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:27.021]  It's going up on Facebook.
[02:52:28.459 --> 02:52:29.860]  We need to get this out to everybody.
[02:52:30.021 --> 02:52:31.462]  I'll be following reports throughout the weekend.
[02:52:31.502 --> 02:52:32.783]  Obviously, David Knight's about to take over.
[02:52:33.144 --> 02:52:38.669]  He has an exclusive interview he conducted with Nigel Farage on A Desperate Warning to America.
[02:52:38.689 --> 02:52:40.791]  He should be getting to that as well.
[02:52:43.153 --> 02:52:45.656]  Let me hit, though, a very important subject here.
[02:52:45.916 --> 02:52:47.457]  We're always very careful about sources.
[02:52:48.817 --> 02:52:50.638]  But the fog of war things get a little blurred.
[02:52:50.658 --> 02:52:53.139]  So I'm not apologizing because we didn't do anything.
[02:52:53.199 --> 02:52:54.100]  And they're not mad at us.
[02:52:54.860 --> 02:52:56.801]  Project Veritas has had some very serious threats.
[02:52:56.841 --> 02:53:03.005]  And let me tell you, James O'Keefe has been arrested, he's been persecuted, he's been attacked before.
[02:53:03.385 --> 02:53:04.585]  The guy is amazing.
[02:53:04.625 --> 02:53:07.347]  He's the model of investigative journalist.
[02:53:08.668 --> 02:53:11.469]  Gumshoe, Mickey Spillane, he's the real deal.
[02:53:11.689 --> 02:53:13.390]  He's the thing they put in comic books, okay?
[02:53:14.731 --> 02:53:14.871]  Now,
[02:53:17.315 --> 02:53:18.695]  We obviously talked to him yesterday.
[02:53:19.015 --> 02:53:20.296]  He's given us exclusives before.
[02:53:21.376 --> 02:53:24.317]  He was talking about giving us an exclusive next Monday on something even bigger.
[02:53:25.537 --> 02:53:28.738]  They got some really bad stuff happening today, and I'm not at liberty to get into it.
[02:53:28.778 --> 02:53:31.619]  They now don't want to get into it right now until he gets out of the air.
[02:53:32.339 --> 02:53:35.199]  So it might be later with David or the Nightly News tonight because they want us to report it.
[02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:41.081]  But we're talking to his people, and they were like, yes, we want to come on.
[02:53:42.039 --> 02:53:47.764]  You know, that plan that we have where you have the code keys, the backup servers, and you have the footage in case something happens to us.
[02:53:48.244 --> 02:53:49.365]  We're now implementing that plan.
[02:53:49.385 --> 02:53:50.506]  Something we talked about before.
[02:53:50.546 --> 02:53:51.267]  That was their idea.
[02:53:52.268 --> 02:53:53.369]  Say what you want about InfoWars.
[02:53:53.389 --> 02:53:54.349]  People know they can trust us.
[02:53:54.430 --> 02:53:57.032]  Do what we say we're going to do and not scoop people and stuff.
[02:53:57.052 --> 02:53:57.532]  We don't care.
[02:53:57.592 --> 02:53:58.913]  It's all about defeating the globalists.
[02:53:59.594 --> 02:54:01.295]  And so I was told real quick, yeah, we're talking to them.
[02:54:01.315 --> 02:54:02.296]  They said, go ahead and mention it.
[02:54:02.877 --> 02:54:07.381]  Either his number two guy or he'll come on as soon as possible, but go ahead and announce that they're getting really serious threats.
[02:54:08.291 --> 02:54:09.632]  And believe me, they've had a lot of threats before.
[02:54:09.652 --> 02:54:11.133]  Can you imagine what these are?
[02:54:11.753 --> 02:54:13.194]  They're changing the whole election right now.
[02:54:14.534 --> 02:54:16.375]  So as soon as O'Keefe's out of the air, we'll know.
[02:54:16.435 --> 02:54:19.957]  I was told to go ahead and announce it, and then they pulled back and said, no, no, we're going to wait.
[02:54:21.458 --> 02:54:22.819]  I'll be on this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:22.839 --> 02:54:24.360]  That's probably where the interview is going to happen.
[02:54:24.520 --> 02:54:33.005]  But whatever's going on, I was told some of it, it's unbelievable, is of such concern that they're basically right now in scramble mode.
[02:54:33.085 --> 02:54:34.685]  So this is a war, people.
[02:54:34.706 --> 02:54:35.306]  It's a war.
[02:54:37.193 --> 02:54:46.518]  You know, we have former top army intelligence people on and top, you know, colonels on and generals and everything else, and they come here, folks, because this is the real deal.
[02:54:47.098 --> 02:54:49.039]  This is the organic response to the New World Order.
[02:54:49.539 --> 02:54:51.761]  I knew this thing was coming 25 years ago.
[02:54:51.821 --> 02:54:54.102]  I tried to get on air for three or four years, finally got on air.
[02:54:54.522 --> 02:54:59.925]  I put every dime I got back into this because the globalists are that evil.
[02:55:01.578 --> 02:55:10.485]  I mean, I wouldn't care if it was some multinational corporate thing that took over that was promoting more freedom and guns, and then I'd want 1776 worldwide, as long as we have independence and sovereignty.
[02:55:10.905 --> 02:55:13.247]  But man, this thing demands you're all in.
[02:55:13.267 --> 02:55:16.650]  I mean, the New World Order isn't giving us quarter, baby.
[02:55:16.670 --> 02:55:19.172]  I guess people don't know, a lot of people don't know, they say, what does that mean?
[02:55:19.192 --> 02:55:26.298]  If you were going to have a fight, two armies or two individuals, you'd say, quarter offered,
[02:55:27.426 --> 02:55:28.367]  No, no quarter offered.
[02:55:28.387 --> 02:55:31.410]  Well then, no quarter offered, no quarter given.
[02:55:31.430 --> 02:55:32.331]  It means we fight to the death.
[02:55:32.351 --> 02:55:34.152]  They're not offering us a quarter.
[02:55:35.834 --> 02:55:36.635]  They're not offering us a quarter.
[02:55:37.655 --> 02:55:38.276]  So I'm all in.
[02:55:38.356 --> 02:55:39.597]  Okay, you're not offering me a quarter?
[02:55:39.637 --> 02:55:40.838]  You're coming for me and my family?
[02:55:40.878 --> 02:55:41.239]  Let's go.
[02:55:42.300 --> 02:55:42.680]  You want it?
[02:55:43.561 --> 02:55:44.622]  We'll see who wins in the end.
[02:55:45.623 --> 02:55:49.787]  My full will, my full intellect, my spirit, everything is now leaned up against you.
[02:55:50.612 --> 02:55:52.934]  And believe me, it's not fun, but it's what's got to be done.
[02:55:53.114 --> 02:55:54.876]  And I can feel the enemy getting weaker.
[02:55:54.916 --> 02:55:58.919]  I can see it politically, but they're leaning up against Providence and a lot of good people, folks.
[02:55:58.939 --> 02:56:04.044]  Even though there's not as many of us left as there was, one of us can beat a hundred of these people.
[02:56:05.225 --> 02:56:07.087]  And the spirit of liberty is rising.
[02:56:08.448 --> 02:56:09.329]  It's happening right now.
[02:56:09.729 --> 02:56:10.430]  Thank Christ.
[02:56:14.349 --> 02:56:19.251]  Briefly, Revelations, it's like the top video now, I guess, on Amazon in documentaries.
[02:56:19.591 --> 02:56:20.872]  Donald Globel government movie.
[02:56:21.872 --> 02:56:28.835]  The new film directed by Chuck Anderson, he stars General Jerry Boykin, former head of Special Forces, Charlie Daniels, Deborah Griffin, Phil Skousen, myself, Alex Jones.
[02:56:29.155 --> 02:56:33.497]  Covers a range of topics such as privacy, 721 Federal Reserve, nationalism versus globalism, and more.

[02:56:59.932 --> 02:57:05.702]  Should be protected, and the way to do it during a meltdown, I believe, is to have gold and silver, water filters, guns, you name it.
[02:57:05.722 --> 02:57:08.307]  The place you get your gold are these wonderful folks in Texas.
[02:57:08.888 --> 02:57:10.270]  I believe an economic crash is coming.
[02:57:10.310 --> 02:57:12.394]  It's already begun in many areas, and you should protect yourself with real money.
[02:57:13.695 --> 02:57:15.497]  Do you want to be a victim or do you want to be prepared?

[02:57:58.067 --> 02:57:59.127]  They have a whole line of stuff.
[02:57:59.147 --> 02:58:03.089]  You should go to their website, but I got one of these like 10 years ago, bought a couple more in the last few years.
[02:58:03.410 --> 02:58:04.290]  They're always upgrading them.
[02:58:04.470 --> 02:58:05.591]  They're normally $6,000.
[02:58:06.111 --> 02:58:08.633]  They're selling them at below cost for whatever reason, I don't know, $1,500.
[02:58:09.253 --> 02:58:13.275]  I paid like four grand for a lesser unit for them years ago, so whatever.
[02:58:13.795 --> 02:58:14.796]  And that was a discount then.
[02:58:15.456 --> 02:58:16.497]  So take advantage of it.
[02:58:16.557 --> 02:58:18.718]  It's their top-of-the-line model, the one I use at home.
[02:58:18.998 --> 02:58:21.400]  It's the perfect power solar generator below cost.

[02:59:08.935 --> 02:59:17.045]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:17.325 --> 02:59:22.007]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:59:36.172 --> 02:59:43.014]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[03:00:02.051 --> 03:00:04.673]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.953 --> 03:00:17.935]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.587 --> 03:00:33.648]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday.
[03:00:33.668 --> 03:00:44.773]  I'm David Knight and we're going to be playing the interview that I had in Vegas just before the final debate between Trump and Clinton with Nigel Farage, the man who's behind Brexit.
[03:00:45.393 --> 03:00:50.275]  You know, and I made a quick reference in the interview to William Wilberforce.
[03:00:50.335 --> 03:00:52.376]  Many of you may not know that history.
[03:00:53.345 --> 03:01:03.594]  William Wilberforce was a man who, for decades, he spent his entire life, he was elected in his early 20s to Parliament in the UK, he spent his entire life fighting the slave trade.
[03:01:04.294 --> 03:01:15.724]  And he was a protege of Newton, the guy who wrote Amazing Grace, himself a former slave trader, and actually had been captured at one point by Muslims and turned into a slave himself.
[03:01:16.565 --> 03:01:17.666]  But then he became a Christian.
[03:01:18.366 --> 03:01:20.748]  And he wrote the song Amazing Grace, did other things.
[03:01:20.768 --> 03:01:25.731]  He was a pastor, and he was involved with the early conversion of William Wilberforce.
[03:01:25.811 --> 03:01:29.514]  And he told Wilberforce not to get out of politics.
[03:01:29.534 --> 03:01:31.155]  He said, God put you there for a reason.
[03:01:32.036 --> 03:01:37.880]  And so for, I guess it was like 30, 40 years, he would continually do these speeches.
[03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:41.983]  I was always reminded when I would see Nigel Farage go to the European Union,
[03:01:43.027 --> 03:01:49.410]  And as he said, when I first came here I told you lot that I was going to get the UK out of the European Union and you all laughed.
[03:01:49.450 --> 03:01:50.631]  Well, you're not laughing now.
[03:01:51.251 --> 03:01:56.874]  William Wilberforce went to the heart of power, the seat of the international slave trade.
[03:01:57.334 --> 03:01:59.876]  You know, the open trade in slaves.
[03:02:00.296 --> 03:02:00.816]  Globalism.
[03:02:00.876 --> 03:02:01.316]  There you go.
[03:02:01.676 --> 03:02:03.978]  They're trying to make slaves out of us all now.
[03:02:05.038 --> 03:02:06.019]  And he opposed that.
[03:02:06.059 --> 03:02:11.322]  It took him a couple of decades to stop the slave trade, the capture of more slaves.
[03:02:11.943 --> 03:02:15.805]  And then he began working on freeing those who were already in slavery.
[03:02:16.446 --> 03:02:17.647]  And he put together a bill.
[03:02:18.644 --> 03:02:26.353]  It got passed in one of the houses, I believe, and they knew that it was going to pass in the final one, but the final vote didn't happen until a few days after he died.
[03:02:26.373 --> 03:02:27.774]  And so that's it.
[03:02:27.814 --> 03:02:30.457]  You know, we need to know that we're doing the right thing.
[03:02:30.477 --> 03:02:39.487]  You have to be convicted about the correctness of your cause, and we are convicted about the correctness of our cause in terms of fighting these same types
[03:02:40.368 --> 03:02:45.476]  of multinational corporations that were part of the slave trade.
[03:02:45.716 --> 03:02:46.798]  You know, it is corporatism.
[03:02:46.918 --> 03:02:52.546]  As Farage said in the interview, this is not capitalism, this is international corporatism.
[03:02:52.606 --> 03:02:56.391]  These are the people who wrote the Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic Partnership.
[03:02:57.112 --> 03:03:00.855]  And you have to understand that when we look at this, America is at the center.
[03:03:00.895 --> 03:03:07.101]  We are the spine on which they hang these two new wings of the globalist government.
[03:03:07.641 --> 03:03:10.283]  And it's an economic union, then it becomes a political union.
[03:03:10.323 --> 03:03:12.185]  That is their tactic, that is their strategy.
[03:03:12.225 --> 03:03:18.911]  That is why everyone in every nation that is part of this globalist system is fighting so hard against Donald Trump.
[03:03:19.855 --> 03:03:28.139]  If we fight globalism here in America, then they lose the central spine on which they have tried to connect everything.
[03:03:28.559 --> 03:03:30.160]  We are at the center of this.
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:32.001]  America is at the center of this.
[03:03:32.021 --> 03:03:36.783]  That's why it is so vital for our independent nations around the world
[03:03:37.503 --> 03:03:40.105]  To get behind for Donald Trump to win.
[03:03:40.725 --> 03:03:47.669]  And as we look at all this talk about election fraud, I'm going to play for you, when we come back, a short excerpt from the interview.
[03:03:47.689 --> 03:03:57.295]  We're going to play the full interview this hour, but I want to play for you a short excerpt from Nigel Farage, where he's talking about the kind of voter fraud that they've seen rampant in the UK.
[03:03:58.116 --> 03:04:04.420]  Because I'm most concerned about electronic fraud, but of course there's a lot of different types of voter fraud, of election fraud.
[03:04:05.342 --> 03:04:09.067]  One of the things he talked about were these paper ballots that they would take around.
[03:04:09.868 --> 03:04:11.671]  Something that was put in by Tony Blair.
[03:04:12.331 --> 03:04:19.561]  And the day after I talked to him about that, there was an article in the Drudge Report talking about exactly the same thing happening here in Texas.
[03:04:20.362 --> 03:04:23.905]  Now, we don't need to just throw in the towel and give up.
[03:04:23.965 --> 03:04:27.349]  I've seen people say, why would Donald Trump talk about voter fraud?
[03:04:27.389 --> 03:04:28.750]  It's just going to discourage his voters.
[03:04:28.770 --> 03:04:30.832]  It's like, no, we understand this is a fight.
[03:04:30.872 --> 03:04:31.833]  Look, we're going to have a fight.
[03:04:32.253 --> 03:04:36.737]  Even if Donald Trump wins, we're still going to have a fight to make the changes happen that need to happen.
[03:04:37.358 --> 03:04:38.319]  This is part of a movement.
[03:04:38.639 --> 03:04:43.222]  This is a movement, as Nigel Farage points out, that is going to continue whether or not Donald Trump wins.
[03:04:43.282 --> 03:04:44.983]  It'll just delay whether or not we're successful.
[03:04:45.403 --> 03:04:52.008]  So we have to understand what their tactic is, and we have to understand what their long-term strategy is.
[03:04:52.048 --> 03:04:53.449]  That's what Nigel Farage talks about.
[03:04:53.809 --> 03:05:01.594]  And so we have to understand how they're going to rig the elections in order to stop them from doing it, or to make sure that it gets undone if they try to do it.
[03:05:01.614 --> 03:05:02.635]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:05:12.383 --> 03:05:17.327]  Now another shirt that was designed and licensed from Roger Stone is the Bill Clinton rape shirt.
[03:05:18.007 --> 03:05:20.669]  Looks like the, you know, communist style Obama Hope shirt.
[03:05:21.390 --> 03:05:27.375]  But says, rape, wear it, get aggressive, start the conversations, get on TV with it.
[03:05:27.395 --> 03:05:28.436]  In fact, I'm going to say this right now.
[03:05:28.856 --> 03:05:38.063]  Anyone that gets on national TV with the shirt, clearly, for more than five seconds, gets $1,000.
[03:05:40.646 --> 03:05:42.227]  That means, you know, behind cameras, you name it.
[03:05:42.387 --> 03:05:52.294]  Anyone that gets it on air on national TV and gets the words out, Bill Clinton is a rapist, are things along that line with a bullhorn.
[03:05:52.334 --> 03:05:53.315]  I could go to this right now. $5,000.
[03:05:57.330 --> 03:05:59.733]  Until a budget of $100,000 has been spent.
[03:06:00.114 --> 03:06:01.576]  Adoptable dogs.
[03:06:01.716 --> 03:06:08.244]  Every year, the Best Friends Animal Society helps cats and dogs who are stuck in animal shelters find homes.
[03:06:13.010 --> 03:06:18.732]  But I think one of the things that we really need to be looking at in this debate is that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:06:18.872 --> 03:06:19.812]  Infowars.com.
[03:06:19.932 --> 03:06:20.933]  Infowars.com.
[03:06:21.013 --> 03:06:21.893]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[03:06:22.233 --> 03:06:23.274]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:06:23.494 --> 03:06:23.714]  Alright.
[03:06:23.734 --> 03:06:24.634]  Bill Clinton.
[03:06:24.654 --> 03:06:31.437]  I got this Hillary for Prison t-shirt and I just want everyone to know about this big presidential campaign that Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:06:31.497 --> 03:06:32.217]  Infowars.com.
[03:06:33.189 --> 03:06:36.231]  Okay, thank you very much, Terrence.
[03:06:36.291 --> 03:06:38.192]  He doesn't age.
[03:06:38.552 --> 03:06:39.793]  No, he doesn't.
[03:06:39.833 --> 03:06:41.253]  He looks great.
[03:06:41.554 --> 03:06:43.815]  We're all going to rickroll.
[03:06:44.535 --> 03:06:50.458]  You've had a $100,000 contest before.
[03:06:50.478 --> 03:06:50.899]  My budget's $100,000.
[03:06:50.939 --> 03:06:54.981]  That means if a bunch of people do this, I'll pay up to $100,000 and stop it.
[03:07:03.792 --> 03:07:08.857]  That's $1,000 if you just get the shirt on national TV.
[03:07:10.599 --> 03:07:11.700]  Visually rape.
[03:07:14.272 --> 03:07:14.692]  It is.
[03:07:15.934 --> 03:07:16.314]  It is.
[03:07:16.334 --> 03:07:19.376]  $5,000 if you get the audio.
[03:07:19.416 --> 03:07:20.077]  Legally and lawfully.
[03:07:20.097 --> 03:07:20.938]  They gotta be outdoors.
[03:07:21.338 --> 03:07:21.939]  Mother-in-law events.
[03:07:21.959 --> 03:07:22.839]  You gotta have a bullhorn.
[03:07:23.360 --> 03:07:24.961]  You gotta have the shirt on or have somebody with it.
[03:07:25.322 --> 03:07:29.425]  Or maybe a big sign with it on it and two of you hold it up and then somebody else bullhorns.
[03:07:29.825 --> 03:07:33.008]  Bill Clinton is a rapist, not a philanderer.
[03:07:33.589 --> 03:07:35.030]  Hillary covers up the rape.
[03:07:39.938 --> 03:07:42.639]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[03:07:42.820 --> 03:07:45.881]  That communist Chinese style net censorship is coming to the web.
[03:07:45.901 --> 03:07:46.962]  Because it's already here.
[03:07:47.362 --> 03:07:48.022]  It's being announced.
[03:07:48.382 --> 03:07:51.844]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.

[03:08:12.745 --> 03:08:15.768]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:08:16.328 --> 03:08:20.492]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:24.907 --> 03:08:26.088]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:26.108 --> 03:08:29.730]  I'm David Knight, your host for the remainder of this live show, Friday, October 21st, 2016.
[03:08:30.230 --> 03:08:36.754]  At the bottom of the hour, we're going to play the interview I had with Nigel Farage in Las Vegas just before the debate.
[03:08:36.774 --> 03:08:38.435]  We're going to play that in its entirety.
[03:08:38.455 --> 03:08:47.061]  I want to play for you in just a moment an excerpt from Nigel Farage's interview where he's talking about some of the fraud techniques in the UK.
[03:08:47.981 --> 03:09:00.509]  And it was interesting because when I came back the very next day, on Drudge Report, I see this article, Texas voter fraud concerns prompt a hotline offering $5,000 reward for tips for whistleblowers.
[03:09:01.431 --> 03:09:07.896]  And the tactic that they're concerned about, and the trend that they see happening there, is precisely what is happening in the UK.
[03:09:07.956 --> 03:09:08.957]  And we're going to talk about that.
[03:09:09.477 --> 03:09:21.167]  The reason we're focusing with Nigel Farage on this is because, as Donald Trump has clearly pointed out, the struggle right now, the key issue right now, is globalism versus nationalism.
[03:09:22.256 --> 03:09:27.819]  And Farage was here, as he explained, because this is a global movement against globalism.
[03:09:28.460 --> 03:09:37.505]  So you've got a small clique of multinational corporations that are trying to take over the political structures worldwide to feather their nest.
[03:09:37.625 --> 03:09:42.208]  And we can see that in the TPP and the TTIP, the Transatlantic, Trans-Pacific
[03:09:42.828 --> 03:09:45.550]  Partnerships, where they become partners with government.
[03:09:45.891 --> 03:09:47.992]  Actually, they're already the senior partner.
[03:09:48.033 --> 03:09:57.300]  They're the ones who wrote these agreements in secret without any of our elected representatives having a say in what was going on, or being allowed to see it, or being allowed to report on it.
[03:09:58.281 --> 03:10:07.709]  And then once they made it available to them, the only one that I know of that even bothered to look at it is Jeff Sessions, and he's been the advisor to Donald Trump since a year ago last August.
[03:10:08.700 --> 03:10:10.821]  And that's why Donald Trump really understands what's going on.
[03:10:11.101 --> 03:10:14.043]  Jeff Sessions understands the rest of his colleagues could care less.
[03:10:14.403 --> 03:10:25.129]  And they threw the entire process for ratifying treaties, and these are treaties, they threw the entire constitutional process out the window so they could advance this very easily.
[03:10:26.021 --> 03:10:26.362]  But this
[03:10:41.401 --> 03:10:42.481]  Could she win, they ask?
[03:10:42.541 --> 03:10:43.422]  And this is the AFP.
[03:10:43.442 --> 03:10:49.344]  They say, from Brexit to the rise of Donald Trump, 2016 has been a humbling year for political forecasters.
[03:10:49.844 --> 03:10:51.064]  Yeah, they've been wrong, haven't they?
[03:10:51.404 --> 03:10:51.984]  All the way through.
[03:10:52.344 --> 03:11:04.008]  We've been told by all these experts, like Nate Silver, telling us that, hey, you know, he doesn't have a chance every step of the way through the primary process.
[03:11:04.388 --> 03:11:09.710]  And so when he says that he doesn't have a chance, and all the mainstream media is telling us that he doesn't have a chance, that's part
[03:11:10.370 --> 03:11:12.011]  Of rigging the election, you understand.
[03:11:12.031 --> 03:11:13.211]  Okay, that's a push-pull.
[03:11:13.792 --> 03:11:14.632]  That's the way they do this.
[03:11:15.132 --> 03:11:17.193]  But it's been a humbling year for these people.
[03:11:17.573 --> 03:11:19.814]  We've shown that they're wrong time and time again.
[03:11:20.514 --> 03:11:24.616]  And we can overcome the election fraud if we understand their tactics.
[03:11:25.336 --> 03:11:30.399]  And we can understand and get behind Donald Trump if we understand their strategy for globalism.
[03:11:30.419 --> 03:11:32.259]  So that's what we're talking to Nigel Farage about.
[03:11:32.279 --> 03:11:37.922]  But they say, in France, could they be wrong again in writing off the far-right's prospects in next year's presidential election?
[03:11:38.522 --> 03:11:42.164]  Of course, they're going to call anybody that opposes globalism somebody who is far right.
[03:11:42.744 --> 03:11:49.828]  Because they want to create this idea in your head that populism or nationalism is the same thing as fascism.
[03:11:49.868 --> 03:11:50.328]  And it isn't!
[03:11:51.269 --> 03:11:51.489]  Okay?
[03:11:51.969 --> 03:11:55.691]  Nationalism was a tactic of Adolf Hitler.
[03:11:56.291 --> 03:11:59.633]  But so was internationalism a tactic of Joseph Stalin.
[03:11:59.993 --> 03:12:02.615]  Both of these guys were headed in the same direction.
[03:12:03.288 --> 03:12:08.270]  It's just that Adolf Hitler said he thought that Joseph Stalin went for the entire thing all at once.
[03:12:08.650 --> 03:12:11.132]  And that was a strategic error, he thought.
[03:12:11.172 --> 03:12:13.853]  He said, no, no, no, we're going to work with the corporations.
[03:12:13.873 --> 03:12:15.434]  That's economic fascism.
[03:12:15.754 --> 03:12:19.375]  Hitler said, we're going to work with the German corporations to make us stronger for conquest.
[03:12:19.796 --> 03:12:22.617]  And then eventually, I will take over from those few people.
[03:12:23.616 --> 03:12:28.620]  The oligarchy that I created out of that system, whereas Stalin just went in and took state ownership of everything.
[03:12:29.020 --> 03:12:32.423]  That, by the way, is the difference between Hillary and Obama.
[03:12:32.783 --> 03:12:34.244]  It's the difference between Hillary and Stalin.
[03:12:34.884 --> 03:12:35.145]  Okay?
[03:12:35.445 --> 03:12:40.749]  Like Stalin, Hillary Clinton, 25 years ago, wanted to take over all of health care all at once.
[03:12:41.149 --> 03:12:47.534]  And so you had all the Democrats criticizing her earlier this year, saying she doesn't understand the importance of incrementalism.
[03:12:48.034 --> 03:12:48.734]  Like Hitler did.
[03:12:49.315 --> 03:12:50.656]  Like Obama did.
[03:12:51.016 --> 03:12:52.797]  So what they did was they put in Obamacare.
[03:12:52.877 --> 03:12:56.678]  And we now see from the released emails that she knows that it's going to fail.
[03:12:56.718 --> 03:12:59.499]  She wants it to fail so she can get to a single-payer system.
[03:12:59.919 --> 03:13:01.039]  And guess who's going to control that?
[03:13:01.379 --> 03:13:01.739]  She will.
[03:13:02.099 --> 03:13:03.140]  She'll control that for you.
[03:13:03.720 --> 03:13:12.483]  But I want to play this clip now of Nigel Farage because he talks precisely about what is now going on in a state investigation of fraud in Tarrant County, Texas.
[03:13:12.563 --> 03:13:15.684]  And this is a tactic that is used throughout the country, folks.
[03:13:15.704 --> 03:13:16.864]  This isn't just a local story.
[03:13:17.384 --> 03:13:18.705]  This is the tactic that they use.
[03:13:18.725 --> 03:13:20.587]  We have to understand their tactics so we can fire them.
[03:13:20.647 --> 03:13:22.749]  Here's what Nigel Farage said in the interview.
[03:13:23.369 --> 03:13:28.474]  The real problem here is electronic voting because the Russians or anybody can take over the machines, right?
[03:13:28.674 --> 03:13:31.536]  It can be done by a corrupt party organization.
[03:13:31.716 --> 03:13:33.578]  Do you have this problem in the UK?
[03:13:34.058 --> 03:13:37.481]  Or do you have more of a paper-based trail that is auditable?
[03:13:37.782 --> 03:13:39.323]  Ours is more of a paper-based system.
[03:13:39.403 --> 03:13:44.968]  However, ours has been very debased by a man called Tony Blair.
[03:13:45.976 --> 03:13:48.680]  For those that don't know him, he's like the British Clinton, really.
[03:13:49.781 --> 03:13:52.164]  He was around at the same time and thought the same.
[03:13:52.544 --> 03:13:56.910]  What Blair did was a massive extension of postal voting.
[03:13:57.911 --> 03:14:01.355]  Now, so the way that happens is, you know, the postie
[03:14:02.536 --> 03:14:20.530]  Delivers your vote and it comes through your door and you know ten minutes later a nice big fella working for one of the trade unions says oh hello mrs. Smith good morning I've come to collect your vote oh you haven't filled it in yet oh well I can help you with that and that and that is happening
[03:14:21.821 --> 03:14:23.722]  Hugely across the United Kingdom.
[03:14:24.183 --> 03:14:32.668]  We've also seen, within some of our religious minorities, just fraud on a third world scale.
[03:14:33.529 --> 03:14:35.530]  So there you go, there's fraud on a third world scale.
[03:14:36.311 --> 03:14:39.093]  Postal voting he says, what we call mail-in ballots here.
[03:14:39.810 --> 03:14:43.192]  And the fact that they would deliver it and then the union boss would know when that's going to be delivered.
[03:14:43.432 --> 03:14:49.275]  Or if you've got a religious minority that would come around and do the same sort of thing to influence you to do this.
[03:14:49.495 --> 03:14:54.518]  Or they could be a little bit more direct about it, as people are concerned is happening here in Texas.
[03:14:54.838 --> 03:14:58.420]  We have a state investigation that is alleging voter fraud in Tarrant County.
[03:14:58.460 --> 03:15:03.103]  And I'll tell you a little bit about the details of this, but this is the article here that was linked from the Drudge Report yesterday.
[03:15:03.823 --> 03:15:15.353]  Some of the people who are fighting this in Tarrant County are offering a $5,000 reward for whistleblowers to look at what happened with the primaries as well as what may happen in this general election.
[03:15:15.874 --> 03:15:20.298]  And they point out that, you know, there is a reason to have mail-in ballots.
[03:15:20.338 --> 03:15:26.723]  Understand, we have people who are sick or incapacitated, but we have to be aware of how the system can be abused.
[03:15:26.783 --> 03:15:29.866]  I say, of course, this is geared for people in the military as well, who are abroad.
[03:15:30.106 --> 03:15:31.727]  Yes, there needs to be a process for that.
[03:15:32.067 --> 03:15:36.308]  And of course they have played with that as well, in many cases delaying them or losing their ballots.
[03:15:36.788 --> 03:15:43.951]  But they talk about how, in this article, they said they allow people to vote from their homes without any ID verification or any identity.
[03:15:44.151 --> 03:15:45.311]  Now think about this for a moment.
[03:15:45.411 --> 03:15:49.693]  Think about all the different ways that you can defraud the system.
[03:15:49.733 --> 03:15:54.434]  And we have to understand the different categories of this so that we can talk intelligently about it.
[03:15:54.454 --> 03:15:55.475]  You know, you've got voter fraud.
[03:15:55.495 --> 03:15:56.055]  So in other words,
[03:15:56.875 --> 03:15:58.177]  Is this a legitimate voter?
[03:15:58.197 --> 03:16:02.041]  You know, we used to hear all the time in South Africa, one man, one vote, right?
[03:16:02.101 --> 03:16:04.543]  Well, let's talk about it one citizen, one vote.
[03:16:05.104 --> 03:16:11.410]  So the first thing the Democrats want to do is, as we're told all the time, they want to bring in illegal immigrants to do the jobs that Americans won't do.
[03:16:11.670 --> 03:16:14.734]  Well, one of the jobs that Americans won't do is elect Democrats in sufficient number.
[03:16:15.390 --> 03:16:19.813]  We don't want them, so they bring in people from out of the country, in many cases illegals.
[03:16:19.833 --> 03:16:25.917]  They're trying in many democratically controlled jurisdictions to allow people who are not citizens to vote in our election.
[03:16:25.997 --> 03:16:31.961]  So, the first fraud is voter fraud, where you have people who are not citizens, who are not qualified to vote, voting.
[03:16:32.001 --> 03:16:33.722]  And that takes place in a number of ways.
[03:16:33.762 --> 03:16:35.183]  We've seen with Project Veritas.
[03:16:35.203 --> 03:16:40.386]  They're saying, well, if I've got a Republican ballot here, somebody registered as a Republican, I'm just going to throw it away.
[03:16:40.406 --> 03:16:41.867]  We've seen them admitting to that.
[03:16:42.547 --> 03:16:48.290]  It's also the kind of fraud where they're doing it by saying we're just gonna give them IDs so that they can vote.
[03:16:49.211 --> 03:16:52.412]  But then it's also the type of thing voter fraud is having dead people vote.
[03:16:52.452 --> 03:16:55.614]  They get the registration rolls as I pointed out in North Carolina.
[03:16:55.954 --> 03:17:01.517]  A friend of my brother-in-law's goes to vote in the 2012 elections and they tell him he's already voted and he says no I haven't.
[03:17:02.213 --> 03:17:09.180]  Because they have a very long, we have the longest, had the longest period in North Carolina of any state to begin the election process.
[03:17:09.200 --> 03:17:16.308]  So, somebody had already voted for him, and they said, yeah, you and somebody else at your address, because you just go in and give them a name and an address, and they let you vote.
[03:17:17.189 --> 03:17:18.770]  And he said, who is that?
[03:17:18.790 --> 03:17:20.872]  And they told him the name, and he says, that's my mother.
[03:17:21.573 --> 03:17:22.053]  She's dead.
[03:17:22.593 --> 03:17:25.735]  So his dead mother and he had already voted when he went to the polls to vote.
[03:17:26.195 --> 03:17:27.095]  So that's voter fraud.
[03:17:27.696 --> 03:17:30.377]  Posing as somebody else to vote and using it over that long period of time.
[03:17:30.417 --> 03:17:33.018]  And then there's this kind of voter fraud, the mail-in voter fraud.
[03:17:33.478 --> 03:17:35.579]  But understand there's also then election fraud.
[03:17:36.482 --> 03:17:44.324]  Now, election fraud is going to be where they miscount the votes at the precinct level, or they hack the machine, as the government is talking about now.
[03:17:44.364 --> 03:17:48.225]  They're saying, oh, we are worried about Russians hacking our electronic voting machines.
[03:17:48.265 --> 03:17:49.465]  Well, there's an easy solution to that.
[03:17:49.945 --> 03:17:51.605]  Get rid of the electronic voting machines.
[03:17:51.625 --> 03:17:59.087]  So that's one of the things, if we get Donald Trump elected, one of the first things that we need to do is start reforming this crooked, corrupt system.
[03:18:00.123 --> 03:18:04.265]  The Republicans and Democrats want a system that they can rig.
[03:18:04.305 --> 03:18:06.526]  The same way that they have gerrymandering, okay?
[03:18:06.566 --> 03:18:09.507]  They want to be able to rig the ballot process.
[03:18:09.527 --> 03:18:18.992]  And one of the ways that you do that is to rig the way the votes are cast at the very beginning, or you can rig the way the votes are counted and tabulated and transmitted, okay?
[03:18:19.052 --> 03:18:20.552]  Not having proper custody of that.
[03:18:20.932 --> 03:18:24.114]  The other thing you can do is you can rig it so that we can't audit it.
[03:18:24.980 --> 03:18:27.462]  They can say, we're not going to do exit polls, as they did in Brazil.
[03:18:27.622 --> 03:18:30.525]  They moved to electronic voting, then they said, we're not going to do exit polls.
[03:18:30.545 --> 03:18:37.951]  And then all of a sudden, the woman who was running, who just got thrown out by impeachment, she was behind 10 points in the poll.
[03:18:38.051 --> 03:18:40.013]  All of a sudden, she wins the next day.
[03:18:40.193 --> 03:18:49.581]  And the one organization that does exit polling, and we have the same thing here in the United States, one organization that does all the exit polling, and they just don't do it.
[03:18:50.222 --> 03:18:50.362]  Yes.
[03:19:20.622 --> 03:19:22.844]  That is covering in line for the candidate.
[03:19:22.864 --> 03:19:33.730]  But getting back to this situation of the mail-in ballots, because this is one of their tactics, they point out that what has to happen with this is that they send these out and they actually call it vote harvesting.
[03:19:34.190 --> 03:19:42.995]  They say it's a form of voting largely unwatched and they say we're getting defeat handed to us in the mail-in ballots and we aren't even paying attention to it.
[03:19:43.416 --> 03:19:45.257]  Say the election is in the mail.
[03:19:45.777 --> 03:19:46.298]  Not the check.
[03:19:46.638 --> 03:19:47.919]  They don't want a check on the elections.
[03:19:48.299 --> 03:19:55.525]  You're supposed to sign these ballots, and then sign the envelope, and you also send them a request to get it, and yet they looked.
[03:19:55.805 --> 03:20:00.830]  When they audited this from the primary, they saw that the signatures didn't match in any of these ways.
[03:20:01.150 --> 03:20:02.711]  That's the way they rig it.
[03:20:03.131 --> 03:20:06.754]  Get the ballot, fill it out, and then send it in in somebody else's name.
[03:20:06.794 --> 03:20:07.755]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:20:09.897 --> 03:20:10.838]  I was raised a Democrat.
[03:20:11.727 --> 03:20:19.109]  See, I didn't know your story, but I think for all of us, it's humanizing it, how you get to the point of this powerful speech that goes worldwide and wakes up so many people.
[03:20:19.169 --> 03:20:21.110]  I just knew it would be very interesting.
[03:20:21.510 --> 03:20:36.714]  So when Trump talks about the lies that the Democrat Party has told, and the failed policies, both in economics, education, and crime,
[03:20:39.577 --> 03:20:45.800]  Your heart should be stirred with passion and strength to do something about it!
[03:20:45.820 --> 03:20:49.702]  I'm from Louisiana originally.
[03:20:50.203 --> 03:20:55.586]  I consider myself a person who, I evacuated from Katrina.
[03:20:56.066 --> 03:20:59.688]  I was in a guard at the time so I had to evacuate and I had to run back actually.
[03:20:59.708 --> 03:21:01.189]  I was called up to serve.
[03:21:01.609 --> 03:21:05.111]  So I did a month in search and rescue and three months of ICU.
[03:21:06.171 --> 03:21:07.592]  And that's where my conversion starts.
[03:21:08.473 --> 03:21:14.697]  I was taking a Blackhawk trip, and as I was taking the Blackhawk trip, we were actually looking for movement.
[03:21:14.738 --> 03:21:15.318]  That was our goal.
[03:21:15.338 --> 03:21:16.639]  We had to look for life.
[03:21:16.939 --> 03:21:18.760]  And just devastation upon devastation.
[03:21:18.800 --> 03:21:24.825]  I remember looking at the east side of New Orleans, and it was all gray, Alex.
[03:21:25.225 --> 03:21:25.946]  Everything was gray.
[03:21:26.626 --> 03:21:27.947]  So we gave up looking for life.
[03:21:28.147 --> 03:21:29.748]  We got to the Riverwalk.
[03:21:30.669 --> 03:21:32.990]  And I saw the pilot starting to cry.
[03:21:33.570 --> 03:21:37.531]  And I looked down, and it's nothing but men and women who look just like me.
[03:21:38.371 --> 03:21:40.592]  And that's when I knew we had believed a lie.
[03:21:41.292 --> 03:21:42.733]  The government cannot take care of you.
[03:21:43.233 --> 03:21:49.054]  It was droves of African Americans, with their hands up, in America, looking for someone to be dropped down.
[03:21:49.134 --> 03:21:50.815]  I don't know the story, but let me guess, what color was the pilot?
[03:21:51.764 --> 03:21:51.964]  White.
[03:21:52.204 --> 03:21:53.405]  That was a shocking moment for me.
[03:21:54.065 --> 03:22:02.390]  And the amazing thing is that we circled back around to the east side later on that day, because you had to do footwork as well as air.
[03:22:02.850 --> 03:22:07.353]  So we went through the homes, making the marks on the walls and whatnot.
[03:22:07.413 --> 03:22:12.836]  In the rubbish of a house, I found a book called Up From Slavery by Booker T. Washington.
[03:22:13.156 --> 03:22:14.417]  At night, I would read that book.
[03:22:15.377 --> 03:22:16.918]  And it changed my life.
[03:22:17.038 --> 03:22:20.240]  Booker T. Washington was a entrepreneur.
[03:22:21.200 --> 03:22:23.702]  He was an education advocate.
[03:22:24.042 --> 03:22:26.103]  He started his own university.
[03:22:26.163 --> 03:22:29.065]  It would be no Tuskegee Airmen if it wasn't for this guy.
[03:22:29.085 --> 03:22:31.066]  It would be no Tuskegee University if it wasn't for this guy.
[03:22:31.506 --> 03:22:32.766]  Slavery has returned!
[03:22:35.788 --> 03:22:37.769]  And she is more vicious than ever before!
[03:22:39.450 --> 03:22:41.111]  Because this time she is colorblind.
[03:22:44.145 --> 03:22:49.049]  31% of white Americans are welfare recipients.
[03:22:49.569 --> 03:22:50.650]  And that was my conversion.
[03:22:50.770 --> 03:22:59.116]  Between that experience, Katrina, obviously, and the book, seeing a black man who was unapologetic for being a Republican changed my entire life.
[03:22:59.256 --> 03:23:01.857]  My whole view of how I needed to advance my life.
[03:23:01.877 --> 03:23:05.320]  I would have never had the opportunity to be able to give a speech at a Trump rally.
[03:23:05.740 --> 03:23:14.806]  Well, that's what Trump does, whether it's myself or you, he gives a voice to other people that have important information, and then he's helping magnify a whole new group of people to truly create real diversity of ideas and thought.
[03:23:27.233 --> 03:23:31.155]  The top Democrat states in America are led by white liberals.
[03:23:31.355 --> 03:23:35.937]  For them, the blacks are the slaves that offer them the votes they need in order to stay in office.
[03:23:36.037 --> 03:23:41.459]  The sad thing is that African Americans in those areas don't see the importance and the power of their vote.
[03:23:41.859 --> 03:23:44.520]  No one party should have a monopoly over the black vote.
[03:23:44.880 --> 03:23:46.121]  People want it, they need to earn it.
[03:23:46.401 --> 03:23:51.043]  The Democrat Party wants to corral African Americans and minorities into one area so they can control them.
[03:23:51.383 --> 03:23:55.785]  And the African Americans have given their vote over to Democrats and they've lost their power.
[03:23:55.805 --> 03:23:56.605]  Let's talk about Trump.
[03:23:56.625 --> 03:24:02.648]  We're going to break in a minute, but what's your, like, in person meeting him, what's your impression?
[03:24:03.468 --> 03:24:04.649]  He's just like you, truly.
[03:24:04.909 --> 03:24:07.750]  He's the guy who says what he thinks and gives it to you straight, no chaser.
[03:24:08.110 --> 03:24:09.531]  You gotta appreciate a man like that.
[03:24:20.504 --> 03:24:21.685]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:21.725 --> 03:24:22.345]  I'm David Knight.
[03:24:22.365 --> 03:24:27.649]  As I point out, we're going to be playing the Nitro-Frage interview in full, beginning in the next segment.
[03:24:27.709 --> 03:24:34.414]  Before we get back to the news, I want to remind you that we have our last run ever of Hillary for Prison t-shirts.
[03:24:34.774 --> 03:24:36.215]  Get yours before we stop selling.
[03:24:36.235 --> 03:24:37.376]  This is our final inventory.
[03:24:37.736 --> 03:24:39.217]  We're putting these out at cost.
[03:24:39.277 --> 03:24:41.699]  It's your last chance to get these collector items.
[03:24:43.419 --> 03:24:54.062]  When we were there in Vegas, somebody went around and put Hillary for Prison bumper stickers on a lot of the orange traffic cones that were out there.
[03:24:54.082 --> 03:24:57.083]  We took a picture of one of those and actually used it as a thumbnail on one of the reports.
[03:24:57.663 --> 03:24:58.763]  Whoever did that, great job.
[03:24:58.863 --> 03:24:59.383]  We didn't do it.
[03:24:59.863 --> 03:25:02.244]  We've got too much to do to be putting bumper stickers on things.
[03:25:02.604 --> 03:25:03.224]  But it's everywhere.
[03:25:03.684 --> 03:25:04.665]  And the shirt is everywhere.
[03:25:04.685 --> 03:25:09.308]  It's going to be, I think, the surviving meme one way or the other of this election.
[03:25:09.348 --> 03:25:14.011]  It'll be a fitting epitaph one way or the other of what this election is about.
[03:25:14.171 --> 03:25:18.033]  Are we going to stand up against corruption or are we going to promote it to the next level?
[03:25:18.313 --> 03:25:24.077]  Hillary is going to take office if she wins as the most corrupt individual you can imagine.
[03:25:24.137 --> 03:25:28.160]  Can you imagine what she's going to be like with all the things she's gotten away with at this point?
[03:25:28.900 --> 03:25:37.816]  What is it going to be like to have this woman come in to the power that she has craved her entire life and with the knowledge that there's not anything that she could do for which she'll be held accountable?
[03:25:37.856 --> 03:25:39.178]  Do you really want a president like that?
[03:25:40.202 --> 03:25:41.003]  We can't afford that.
[03:25:41.023 --> 03:25:45.988]  Alright, but also we have a Brain Force special that's going to be ending soon.
[03:25:46.028 --> 03:25:46.589]  A mega special.
[03:25:46.809 --> 03:25:49.011]  25% off at Infowarslife.com.
[03:25:49.311 --> 03:25:51.353]  That is my favorite supplement.
[03:25:51.414 --> 03:25:57.940]  I call it Brain Focus because it's one of the few supplements that I take that I can really feel the difference.
[03:25:57.980 --> 03:26:01.444]  Most of the things that I take, I do them because I understand what the long-term health effects are.
[03:26:01.864 --> 03:26:12.091]  And I can see that I'm healthier in terms of not getting colds and those sorts of things when I take these other supplements, but I can feel the focus when I'm talking, when I've taken BrainForce and when I haven't.
[03:26:12.171 --> 03:26:15.373]  So it's 25% off at Infowarslife.com.
[03:26:15.393 --> 03:26:17.654]  That's our mega special for BrainForce.
[03:26:18.955 --> 03:26:30.843]  Now, one of the things I think is interesting, when we look at all this talk about election fraud, and they try to make an issue out of this, you know, think about how the very first debate, the first Republican debate,
[03:26:31.873 --> 03:26:34.795]  That was narrated by Fox News.
[03:26:34.815 --> 03:26:38.737]  They had the Fox News anchors and it was Brett Baier there and he was doing a loyalty test.
[03:26:38.757 --> 03:26:39.498]  Very first question.
[03:26:39.538 --> 03:26:46.202]  Raise your hand if you can't pledge that you're going to support the Republican nominee regardless of who it is.
[03:26:46.222 --> 03:26:46.642]  Remember that?
[03:26:46.802 --> 03:26:47.543]  Big controversy?
[03:26:48.083 --> 03:26:50.505]  They came after Donald Trump because he was honest, wasn't he?
[03:26:51.025 --> 03:26:52.747]  He says, well, I don't know who these guys are.
[03:26:52.767 --> 03:26:54.368]  I can't say right now that I'm going to vote for them.
[03:26:54.408 --> 03:26:59.052]  Could you as a voter say at that point in time, in August of 2015, that you would support those guys?
[03:26:59.072 --> 03:27:00.093]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[03:27:00.113 --> 03:27:02.095]  Why would you be part of that system?
[03:27:02.395 --> 03:27:08.640]  And he's not going to pledge to this corrupt political system either to accept whatever answer it gives us.
[03:27:09.361 --> 03:27:11.263]  And yet, that's the way the debates ended.
[03:27:11.863 --> 03:27:20.526]  Towards the end of the last debate, you've got another Fox News anchor coming out and saying, will you pledge loyalty to this political system no matter how it looks?
[03:27:21.287 --> 03:27:21.747]  How absurd!
[03:27:21.767 --> 03:27:22.907]  How absurd!
[03:27:22.947 --> 03:27:31.370]  And of course, we've had, and we talked about it all day, Alex, did all the different Democrats going back to Al Gore and many others in recent time that have complained about the results of elections.
[03:27:31.470 --> 03:27:33.731]  And then we have this article that's on Drudge Report today.
[03:27:33.811 --> 03:27:34.051]  U.S.
[03:27:34.071 --> 03:27:37.773]  vote authorities are warned to be alert to Russian hacks who are faking fraud.
[03:27:38.433 --> 03:27:40.414]  And they say government officials from the U.S.
[03:27:40.735 --> 03:27:45.057]  are saying that hackers with ties to Russia's intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility.
[03:27:46.178 --> 03:27:47.519]  Okay, well, let's just understand.
[03:27:47.979 --> 03:27:54.023]  They say these officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said that they didn't think that that would be able to happen, though, because the U.S.
[03:27:54.063 --> 03:28:02.629]  system is so large, so diffuse, diffuse, that's their term, and antiquated, that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the November 8th election.
[03:28:02.969 --> 03:28:04.110]  Let's unpack that a little bit for you.
[03:28:05.382 --> 03:28:06.683]  It's diffuse, okay?
[03:28:06.723 --> 03:28:07.884]  It's diverse, in other words.
[03:28:08.624 --> 03:28:13.847]  Well, that means that we have no central control as they're trying to make this case for right now, okay?
[03:28:13.867 --> 03:28:18.330]  We've got people in Homeland Security and others saying, let the federal government run all the elections.
[03:28:18.410 --> 03:28:19.711]  No, we don't want to have that happen.
[03:28:20.171 --> 03:28:21.132]  We don't want to have that happen.
[03:28:21.152 --> 03:28:22.713]  We want a diverse system.
[03:28:23.033 --> 03:28:24.834]  The next thing they say, well, it's antiquated.
[03:28:25.615 --> 03:28:26.175]  What does that mean?
[03:28:26.735 --> 03:28:29.217]  Well, it means if you've got paper ballots, they can't hack it, can they?
[03:28:30.407 --> 03:28:32.268]  That's what we need to go back to.
[03:28:32.728 --> 03:28:36.030]  It's easily managed, it's easily monitored, it's easily audited.
[03:28:36.391 --> 03:28:38.972]  It is difficult to hack paper ballots.
[03:28:38.992 --> 03:28:44.595]  Yeah, they can stuff the stuff in there, but it's far easier to see people stuffing pieces of paper in and to catch them on it.
[03:28:44.896 --> 03:28:49.698]  Just like I was talking about these mail-in ballots where they got the signatures inside and outside, don't match.
[03:28:50.699 --> 03:28:51.900]  We understand what that's about.
[03:28:52.040 --> 03:28:55.562]  But if you have a paper trail, then you've got a way to do it.
[03:28:55.582 --> 03:28:58.764]  But you can always shut off that paper trail if you've got electronic voting machines.
[03:28:59.264 --> 03:29:01.066]  And we've seen that done in other countries.
[03:29:01.266 --> 03:29:03.989]  25% of the votes just disappearing without an audit trail.
[03:29:04.149 --> 03:29:04.690]  Can you imagine?
[03:29:05.391 --> 03:29:12.038]  Tens of millions of votes just disappearing down the memory hole because we go to electronic voting.
[03:29:12.438 --> 03:29:13.940]  And what's the basis of the U.S.
[03:29:13.980 --> 03:29:21.147]  government formally accusing Russia of being involved with these cyber attacks against the Democrats, okay?
[03:29:22.148 --> 03:29:29.775]  Their basis for this, and they don't mention it in this article, but they said, well, we've seen the same types of methods and they have the motivation.
[03:29:30.536 --> 03:29:33.819]  Well, the methods that they used are shared by many people, including the US government.
[03:29:34.582 --> 03:29:38.105]  And of course, the motivation is shared by many, too, to see that the Democrats don't win.
[03:29:38.145 --> 03:29:45.070]  But understand that Guccifer, 1.0, the guy that they brought over here, I tried to interview him, by the way, and the feds would not let that happen.
[03:29:45.090 --> 03:29:54.077]  They don't want people to hear that a guy who's not even a computer programmer could guess personal details of the Clintons, of the Bushes, and get into their emails.
[03:29:54.297 --> 03:29:55.798]  That's how vulnerable the system is.
[03:29:55.998 --> 03:29:57.619]  We're going to play Nigel Farage when we come back.
[03:29:57.659 --> 03:29:58.040]  Stay with us.
[03:29:58.874 --> 03:30:01.861]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:02.804 --> 03:30:05.470]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:09.881 --> 03:30:11.182]  We're red on election day.
[03:30:11.303 --> 03:30:14.266]  Perhaps the biggest election in American history is just days away.
[03:30:14.426 --> 03:30:18.991]  We know that in past elections, there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election fraud.
[03:30:19.051 --> 03:30:26.278]  From dead people voting, to people registering false identifications, to government leaders providing fast-track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes.
[03:30:26.459 --> 03:30:27.920]  This is happening right in front of us.
[03:30:28.140 --> 03:30:32.545]  Now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.
[03:30:32.585 --> 03:30:34.506]  Government shills are campaigning for Clinton.
[03:30:34.606 --> 03:30:37.787]  Mainstream news attacking Donald Trump all day like rabbit hounds.
[03:30:37.967 --> 03:30:44.709]  Rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting Trump.
[03:30:44.829 --> 03:30:47.390]  Fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms.
[03:30:47.610 --> 03:30:50.831]  So with all this, what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen?
[03:30:51.071 --> 03:30:52.892]  What can we do to prevent election fraud?
[03:30:53.092 --> 03:30:56.194]  I propose that all Donald Trump supporters wear red on Election Day.
[03:30:56.295 --> 03:31:00.058]  On November 8th, when you head to the polls to vote Donald Trump, be decked out in red.
[03:31:00.158 --> 03:31:06.182]  This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout, we can prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout.
[03:31:06.302 --> 03:31:09.185]  Wear red on Election Day, and Make America Great Again!
[03:31:09.807 --> 03:31:15.070]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words, and his was action.
[03:31:15.670 --> 03:31:17.191]  His was what he's done to women.
[03:31:17.231 --> 03:31:22.894]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[03:31:23.134 --> 03:31:25.435]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[03:31:25.795 --> 03:31:31.978]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[03:31:32.098 --> 03:31:37.401]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[03:31:48.240 --> 03:31:50.983]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[03:31:51.844 --> 03:31:53.306]  It's a fight for our minds.
[03:31:53.967 --> 03:31:55.909]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[03:31:56.230 --> 03:32:00.435]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:32:00.575 --> 03:32:03.919]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[03:32:04.019 --> 03:32:05.601]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:32:05.801 --> 03:32:06.162]  Take action!
[03:32:09.775 --> 03:32:11.697]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[03:32:11.737 --> 03:32:12.818]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:32:13.078 --> 03:32:13.999]  Why is this so good?
[03:32:14.279 --> 03:32:19.524]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:32:19.604 --> 03:32:33.157]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:32:33.217 --> 03:32:34.598]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:32:35.359 --> 03:32:36.921]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:32:37.021 --> 03:32:39.503]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:32:39.603 --> 03:32:40.865]  These are all parasites.
[03:32:40.905 --> 03:32:42.006]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:32:42.026 --> 03:32:43.067]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:32:43.367 --> 03:32:47.712]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:32:47.912 --> 03:32:51.095]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:32:51.135 --> 03:32:54.236]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:32:54.256 --> 03:32:55.257]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:32:55.317 --> 03:32:57.198]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:57.258 --> 03:32:58.278]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:32:58.298 --> 03:33:00.379]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:33:00.999 --> 03:33:04.021]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[03:33:04.301 --> 03:33:06.182]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:33:06.562 --> 03:33:08.523]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:33:21.078 --> 03:33:23.280]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:23.740 --> 03:33:28.965]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:33:32.188 --> 03:33:47.222]  What I would say is, you know, whatever happens here on November the 8th, American politics is never going to be the same again.
[03:33:52.520 --> 03:33:53.840]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Farage.
[03:33:54.501 --> 03:33:55.741]  Americans have seen a lot of clips.
[03:33:55.761 --> 03:33:57.422]  We know what an effective speaker you are.
[03:33:57.442 --> 03:34:03.603]  We know what a fearless speaker you are, going right to the seat of power and taking them on, speaking truth to them.
[03:34:03.904 --> 03:34:07.945]  I want to ask you what Donald Trump needs to do in this final debate tonight.
[03:34:08.005 --> 03:34:15.327]  But before we do, real quickly, we've seen a lot of revelations from Hillary Clinton talking to various people, the real Hillary Clinton.
[03:34:15.387 --> 03:34:20.809]  One of the things she tells the bankers is that she dreams of a hemispheric common market.
[03:34:21.269 --> 03:34:25.050]  With no borders and with hemispheric control of our economy.
[03:34:25.090 --> 03:34:26.231]  That's what she's dreaming of.
[03:34:26.831 --> 03:34:27.531]  That's our nightmare.
[03:34:27.631 --> 03:34:34.013]  How is her dream of a hemispheric union like the European Union that you have warned people about?
[03:34:34.454 --> 03:34:40.716]  Well, in a sense, I think we can answer that question and your later question about what Donald Trump should do later.
[03:34:41.236 --> 03:34:42.056]  We'll do it all at once.
[03:34:42.536 --> 03:34:43.897]  Because I think, actually,
[03:34:44.966 --> 03:34:53.317]  WikiLeaks telling us what she was saying and being paid a fortune to speak to Wall Street investment banks and companies.
[03:34:53.878 --> 03:34:55.320]  I think what she said there was the truth.
[03:34:56.261 --> 03:34:59.385]  She was vehemently opposed, as was Obama.
[03:34:59.986 --> 03:35:02.088]  ...to Britain voting for Brexit.
[03:35:02.809 --> 03:35:08.474]  And in many ways, Brexit wasn't just about the United Kingdom and our relationship with the European Union.
[03:35:08.494 --> 03:35:24.108]  It was about the whole of our Western world, of our democratic systems, of whether we're to be independent, sovereign nation states that vote for our own governments, make our own laws, control our own borders, or whether we're to throw all of that away for some sort of higher order.
[03:35:24.148 --> 03:35:25.229]  Now, I've spent
[03:35:26.343 --> 03:35:26.823]  We're good to go.
[03:35:47.395 --> 03:36:04.022]  So I thought it was very interesting that Obama came to Britain and told us not to vote for Brexit, that after I came to America a couple of months ago and spoke at a Trump rally about Brexit and what I thought the implications might be for the US elections, Hillary attacked me personally.
[03:36:04.122 --> 03:36:09.665]  And I think at the heart of this, look, we've got two candidates here, right, standing for president.
[03:36:10.105 --> 03:36:12.946]  I think we could say, honestly, they're both imperfect.
[03:36:13.627 --> 03:36:14.467]  Mind you, do you know what?
[03:36:14.687 --> 03:36:15.507]  We're all human beings.
[03:36:15.747 --> 03:36:16.568]  We're all imperfect.
[03:36:17.348 --> 03:36:20.572]  But the real point here is what is the big vision?
[03:36:21.192 --> 03:36:32.644]  And Hillary is completely tied into this big business, big bank, globalist agenda that effectively wants to take away the ability of the nation state
[03:36:33.365 --> 03:36:35.447]  To be the master of its own destiny.
[03:36:35.607 --> 03:36:56.762]  And one of the reasons I was really keen to come back today was to talk about this stuff and to warn Americans that actually if this woman becomes president, piece by piece, she will drag you into something, if she possibly can, that will take away your democratic rights, take away the ability to control your borders, and make you less safe
[03:36:57.603 --> 03:37:00.005]  In an age of international terrorism.
[03:37:00.446 --> 03:37:03.308]  I think Hillary was telling the globalists that she's on the same page with them.
[03:37:03.528 --> 03:37:10.735]  She understands that first you have to have an economic union, and then it's going to progress to a political union, and we saw that with the EU as well, didn't we?
[03:37:11.135 --> 03:37:19.523]  We have this hemispheric union that's economic, then as things start to deteriorate, perhaps by design, then they consolidate that into a
[03:37:20.103 --> 03:37:21.204]  Globalist Union.
[03:37:21.224 --> 03:37:28.391]  So we see the progression from hemisphere to global with all these agreements, and a progression from economic to political union.
[03:37:28.671 --> 03:37:42.964]  Right back to the early 1950s, the architects of the European Union, Jean Monnet, a French academic, and he's writing in 1951-52 that we will take the peoples of Europe towards a political union using economic arguments.
[03:37:43.584 --> 03:37:45.286]  Basically, we're going to lie to you.
[03:37:46.346 --> 03:37:47.787]  I mean, that's what they were saying.
[03:37:47.807 --> 03:37:51.288]  And I believe that Hillary is of that mould.
[03:37:51.448 --> 03:37:54.750]  And I think the key thing is that the US is at the centre of this, aren't they?
[03:37:55.450 --> 03:38:01.172]  We have seen consolidation with Europe, with the European Union, and of course what Hillary is talking about is the North American Union.
[03:38:01.533 --> 03:38:04.694]  But now we've got the next step towards globalism.
[03:38:05.194 --> 03:38:07.716]  The Trans-Atlantic, the Trans-Pacific partnerships.
[03:38:08.136 --> 03:38:10.798]  That's where they create the economic consolidation.
[03:38:11.278 --> 03:38:15.881]  And that's going to be the precedent to a political global governance.
[03:38:16.261 --> 03:38:21.844]  Now, I think that Donald Trump is the only chance we've got of throwing a monkey wrench into this system, don't you?
[03:38:21.864 --> 03:38:23.245]  Or as you would say, a spanner.
[03:38:23.645 --> 03:38:24.226]  Yeah, a spanner.
[03:38:24.246 --> 03:38:25.387]  Yeah, no, I mean, look.
[03:38:26.747 --> 03:38:28.768]  Clinton represents continuity.
[03:38:29.108 --> 03:38:34.911]  She represents the kind of politics that the Western world, because let's face it, where America goes, we tend to follow.
[03:38:34.931 --> 03:38:37.273]  I'm just hoping that for once you follow us.
[03:38:38.373 --> 03:38:39.614]  In terms of the Brexit vote.
[03:38:40.014 --> 03:38:47.598]  But no, I think that she represents this direction of government that has become completely detached.
[03:38:48.658 --> 03:38:57.885]  From the hopes and aspirations of ordinary people, has led us into an endless series of foreign wars, and I mean Libya being the last example.
[03:38:58.266 --> 03:39:00.487]  Is the world a safer place with a President Hillary Clinton?
[03:39:00.928 --> 03:39:03.610]  We've seen her set the Middle East on fire, first in Libya, then in Syria.
[03:39:03.810 --> 03:39:10.335]  We've seen her Russian reset, essentially a reset of the Cold War, and perhaps a hot war that she's implying.
[03:39:10.655 --> 03:39:11.816]  It's the old thing, isn't it?
[03:39:11.876 --> 03:39:13.177]  It's tactics and strategy.
[03:39:13.197 --> 03:39:15.959]  You know, your short-term military tactics can be right,
[03:39:16.940 --> 03:39:22.502]  In terms of, you set out to depose an Arab nationalist leader, but where was the strategy?
[03:39:23.103 --> 03:39:24.283]  Where was the long-term goal?
[03:39:25.063 --> 03:39:27.384]  What were we seeking to leave behind us?
[03:39:27.424 --> 03:39:34.807]  And we seem to have this deluded idea that somehow these Arab states are all going to become democracies in exactly the same way that we are.
[03:39:34.827 --> 03:39:35.788]  Well, they've never been that.
[03:39:36.288 --> 03:39:38.909]  They've never shown any desire, frankly, to be that.
[03:39:39.189 --> 03:39:42.190]  And I think Trump should talk about Libya a bit more.
[03:39:43.351 --> 03:39:45.792]  And I think he should talk a little bit more about Iraq.
[03:39:46.696 --> 03:39:58.946]  I think he should talk a bit more about the fact that she is part of a political cabal that led to a gap in the market that ISIS are doing their very best to fill.
[03:39:59.206 --> 03:40:00.547]  And I think he's got to focus on that.
[03:40:00.747 --> 03:40:01.568]  Because I'm very struck.
[03:40:02.381 --> 03:40:12.409]  You know, when these debates get very personal and very dirty, when it gets dragged into the mud, and I mean, let's face it, the first 20 minutes of the St.
[03:40:12.449 --> 03:40:16.952]  Louis debate, I was watching it like this, I mean, it was so awful!
[03:40:17.372 --> 03:40:20.114]  It was difficult to believe what was being said and what was going on.
[03:40:21.115 --> 03:40:23.297]  But as soon as Trump is able to pivot
[03:40:24.395 --> 03:40:30.738]  Away from that stuff, and to talk policy, and to talk big picture, and to talk about what is America's place in the world.
[03:40:31.058 --> 03:40:32.999]  When he starts doing that, he starts winning.
[03:40:33.159 --> 03:40:35.961]  Let's talk a little bit about the establishment's tactics right now.
[03:40:36.461 --> 03:40:41.504]  They're telling us that he doesn't have a chance, Trump doesn't have a chance, based on what they tell us the polls are saying.
[03:40:41.804 --> 03:40:46.526]  But they told you the same thing in Brexit up to the day of the election, didn't they?
[03:40:46.586 --> 03:40:52.129]  Well, in fact, there was an opinion poll that came out at 10.30 on the morning of the Brexit referendum.
[03:40:52.669 --> 03:40:52.789]  Yes.
[03:41:08.346 --> 03:41:10.987]  The voters that think, hey, do you know what?
[03:41:11.107 --> 03:41:16.830]  We haven't voted for 20 years, but maybe if we go down to the polling station today, we can change something.
[03:41:17.150 --> 03:41:20.951]  So there is a bit of an attempt here to sow defeatism.
[03:41:21.432 --> 03:41:24.353]  As you just pointed out, the intention is really to move public opinion.
[03:41:24.693 --> 03:41:28.975]  We call them push polls, because they're trying to form public opinion more than they are trying to measure it.
[03:41:29.375 --> 03:41:39.083]  They're not really scientific when they tell us that they got a margin of error of 4 points here and 4 points there and yet we see them spread apart by 10 points, 12 points, it just doesn't add up.
[03:41:39.543 --> 03:41:45.468]  But I think a key thing is that they're not measuring the Trump movement accurately.
[03:41:45.928 --> 03:41:50.951]  The Trump movement is not made up of likely voters, and we see that as the footnote on all these polls.
[03:41:51.031 --> 03:41:52.212]  It's a poll of likely voters.
[03:41:52.772 --> 03:41:55.093]  Did you see that same sort of thing in Brexit?
[03:41:55.193 --> 03:41:55.633]  Totally.
[03:41:55.854 --> 03:41:58.875]  I mean, you know, YouGov are the biggest polling company in the United Kingdom.
[03:41:58.915 --> 03:42:03.398]  They've been considered to be the gold standard of pollsters over the last decade, and perhaps a little bit more.
[03:42:03.978 --> 03:42:10.582]  And they had their 1,000-tracker poll, 1,000 voters, and they were tracking all through the referendum, you know, which way they were moving.
[03:42:10.942 --> 03:42:12.863]  But, you know, they weren't connecting.
[03:42:13.624 --> 03:42:17.585]  With the kind of people I was meeting on the street, who'd never voted in their lives!
[03:42:18.366 --> 03:42:21.427]  And if a polling company rang them up, they'd just put the phone down.
[03:42:21.487 --> 03:42:24.468]  So yes, there are two phenomena here.
[03:42:25.008 --> 03:42:27.069]  Firstly, there's the shy voter.
[03:42:28.189 --> 03:42:30.230]  So, I'm not going to tell these people I'm voting Trump.
[03:42:30.250 --> 03:42:31.470]  They might think something bad of me.
[03:42:31.790 --> 03:42:33.591]  But actually, privately, I feel I am.
[03:42:33.871 --> 03:42:36.332]  So there's the shy voter, but there's also the non-voter.
[03:42:36.612 --> 03:42:40.853]  So look, I think you're quite right to be deeply sceptical about the polls.
[03:42:40.933 --> 03:42:42.294]  I mean, my reading of it would be this.
[03:42:43.274 --> 03:42:47.777]  I do think that the tape, the Bush tape, did damage Trump.
[03:42:47.797 --> 03:42:50.079]  I think we have to be honest about that, but it did hurt him.
[03:42:51.539 --> 03:42:58.324]  My guess is he probably is a little bit behind, but still very much in with a chance.
[03:42:58.824 --> 03:43:02.186]  And I think that tonight's debate is pretty key.
[03:43:02.206 --> 03:43:05.689]  You see, I think that in the first debate,
[03:43:06.627 --> 03:43:07.507]  She had the better of him.
[03:43:08.808 --> 03:43:10.169]  And that's down to experience.
[03:43:11.029 --> 03:43:13.610]  He was stepping up to a level that he'd never been at before.
[03:43:13.950 --> 03:43:14.650]  I've been there myself.
[03:43:15.591 --> 03:43:32.538]  I've done these big debates and I know that when you're somewhat virginal, going into these things, well we can call Trump virginal perhaps as a matter of conjecture, but when you're going into these things, and you've never done them before, they're tough, but I felt at the end of the second debate, he completely dominated.
[03:43:33.238 --> 03:43:38.001]  He didn't just dominate her, he dominated the people doing the debates with the moderators!
[03:43:38.041 --> 03:43:41.804]  He understood he was in a 3 against 1 situation and he called him out on it.
[03:43:41.864 --> 03:43:42.244]  And he did.
[03:43:42.625 --> 03:43:43.785]  And he was right to do so.
[03:43:44.006 --> 03:43:48.669]  So I think psychologically, he comes to Las Vegas with the upper hand.
[03:43:49.369 --> 03:43:52.291]  She's going to be very nervous going into this tonight.
[03:43:52.912 --> 03:43:54.093]  She's going to play very safe.
[03:43:55.674 --> 03:44:00.279]  And I think he will go in and look for the knockout blow.
[03:44:00.960 --> 03:44:02.382]  Let's talk to the voters for a second.
[03:44:02.622 --> 03:44:07.908]  Because the whole point of these polls, as we've just been saying, is to discourage people, to get them to drop out.
[03:44:08.917 --> 03:44:16.525]  But when I look at what you did in England, it reminds me of William Wilberforce, the guy who ended slavery virtually single-handedly.
[03:44:16.545 --> 03:44:21.590]  It's what you did when you went to the European Union and you said, we're going to get Britain out of the European Union.
[03:44:22.331 --> 03:44:29.358]  William Wilberforce, for his entire life, took on the moneyed interests, the multinational corporations that were involved in free trade.
[03:44:29.978 --> 03:44:31.239]  Free trade of slaves.
[03:44:31.879 --> 03:44:33.600]  And so he stopped that slavery.
[03:44:33.660 --> 03:44:35.041]  It took him an entire lifetime to do it.
[03:44:35.061 --> 03:44:38.743]  The final vote to outlaw slavery occurred shortly after he died.
[03:44:38.783 --> 03:44:40.744]  So this is a long-term movement.
[03:44:41.304 --> 03:44:44.046]  We can go straight to the seat of power.
[03:44:44.086 --> 03:44:45.266]  William Wilberforce has shown that.
[03:44:45.607 --> 03:44:48.348]  You showed that to us in Britain with Brexit.
[03:44:48.408 --> 03:44:51.290]  We can take them on directly and we can win.
[03:44:51.350 --> 03:44:52.190]  It's a long-term game.
[03:44:52.210 --> 03:44:53.211]  They've been in it for a long term.
[03:44:53.911 --> 03:45:00.656]  This is a movement, this is what we see being started here in America behind Trump, and it's a movement that you started with Brexit as well.
[03:45:01.236 --> 03:45:05.058]  Yes, and don't think that this is just America and Britain.
[03:45:05.519 --> 03:45:22.190]  This is actually happening across a lot of Europe as well, and very important that we remember that we've got people in France, and Germany, and Hungary, and Italy, and everywhere you go now, people are saying, you know, the global elite have led us very badly, the rich have got richer, the poor have got poorer, this simply isn't working.
[03:45:22.250 --> 03:45:23.511]  And one thing I would say,
[03:45:24.311 --> 03:45:32.034]  Is, you know, whatever happens here on November the 8th, American politics is never going to be the same again.
[03:45:32.234 --> 03:45:33.275]  That's right.
[03:45:33.355 --> 03:45:34.936]  It simply can't be, because you're right.
[03:45:35.736 --> 03:45:39.838]  Actually, I mean, Trump's not a Republican candidate, he's an Independent.
[03:45:40.078 --> 03:45:41.518]  Yeah, he's taken over the party!
[03:45:41.538 --> 03:45:42.219]  He is now!
[03:45:42.239 --> 03:45:43.999]  You're the ones looking in for him!
[03:45:44.059 --> 03:45:46.020]  You know, and everyone's run away from him.
[03:45:46.700 --> 03:45:48.041]  He's effectively an Independent.
[03:45:48.201 --> 03:45:51.022]  Now, if he wins, he wins, and America changes course.
[03:45:51.802 --> 03:45:52.643]  But if he doesn't win,
[03:45:53.553 --> 03:45:55.264]  If the establishment win this time.
[03:45:56.536 --> 03:46:04.858]  That is not the end of this story, because all those people that will have been motivated to stand up and do something, they're not going to go away.
[03:46:04.878 --> 03:46:06.358]  They're not going to disappear.
[03:46:07.098 --> 03:46:12.640]  So, yeah, I think ultimately, you know, we've toppled the establishment in the United Kingdom.
[03:46:12.680 --> 03:46:18.041]  It took us a very, very long time and a whole number of false starts, but we've done it.
[03:46:18.141 --> 03:46:20.721]  And I think that is going to happen in the USA.
[03:46:21.141 --> 03:46:23.662]  It's just a question of whether it's this year or whether you have to wait a bit.
[03:46:23.942 --> 03:46:26.264]  There's a lot of talk about election fraud.
[03:46:26.284 --> 03:46:30.968]  As a matter of fact, the headline on USA Today is, no election fraud.
[03:46:31.469 --> 03:46:35.653]  And yet these same people will tell us we've got to be very, very concerned about the Russians taking over our elections.
[03:46:35.693 --> 03:46:40.197]  To the point that they want the federal government to seize control of running our elections.
[03:46:40.797 --> 03:46:45.898]  The real problem here is electronic voting, because the Russians or anybody can take over the machines, right?
[03:46:46.118 --> 03:46:48.959]  It can be done by a corrupt party organization.
[03:46:49.139 --> 03:46:50.999]  Do you have this problem in the UK?
[03:46:51.479 --> 03:46:54.880]  Or do you have more of a paper-based trail that is auditable?
[03:46:55.180 --> 03:46:56.741]  Ours is more of a paper-based system.
[03:46:56.821 --> 03:47:02.402]  However, ours has been very debased by a man called Tony Blair.
[03:47:03.394 --> 03:47:06.116]  For those that don't know him, he's like the British Clinton, really.
[03:47:06.816 --> 03:47:09.578]  You know, he was around at the same time and thought the same.
[03:47:09.978 --> 03:47:14.320]  What Blair did was a massive extension of postal voting.
[03:47:15.341 --> 03:47:32.811]  Now, so the way that happens is, you know, the postie delivers your vote, and it comes through your door, and, you know, ten minutes later, a nice big fella, working for one of the trade unions, says, oh, hello Mrs Smith, good morning, I've come to collect your vote.
[03:47:33.504 --> 03:47:34.745]  Oh, you haven't filled it in yet?
[03:47:35.085 --> 03:47:36.266]  Oh, well I can help you with that.
[03:47:36.546 --> 03:47:41.169]  And that is happening hugely across the United Kingdom.
[03:47:41.629 --> 03:47:50.095]  We've also seen, within some of our religious minorities, just fraud on a third world scale.
[03:47:50.896 --> 03:47:59.722]  So, now we've got Britain out of the EU, one of my next big campaigns is to abolish what we call postal voting and what you call pre-voting, I think.
[03:48:00.342 --> 03:48:01.363]  I think it should be abolished.
[03:48:02.223 --> 03:48:17.293]  There aren't many things we can learn from France, but the French insist that to vote in a French election, you physically have to turn up, in person, on the day, collect a numbered ballot paper, put your cross on it, and put it in a box.
[03:48:17.513 --> 03:48:18.353]  Well, we know that too.
[03:48:18.454 --> 03:48:20.095]  We did that when we had elections in Iraq.
[03:48:20.355 --> 03:48:25.378]  And on one day, everybody showed up, they got their finger painted purple, and they couldn't vote again.
[03:48:25.418 --> 03:48:26.078]  It was that simple.
[03:48:26.118 --> 03:48:26.759]  Well, it can be done.
[03:48:29.041 --> 03:48:33.788]  There are lots of arguments about modern living, about technology.
[03:48:34.168 --> 03:48:35.771]  Frankly, I wouldn't trust any of them.
[03:48:36.752 --> 03:48:43.904]  And I think getting rid of pre-voting, getting rid of postal voting, making election day real, is something that we should all be campaigning for.
[03:48:44.668 --> 03:48:45.449]  One final question.
[03:48:45.469 --> 03:48:48.571]  As you said earlier, this is a global movement.
[03:48:49.171 --> 03:48:55.955]  And one of the things that the globalists have done is to tell people that they need to think globally, act locally.
[03:48:55.995 --> 03:48:59.998]  I think we need to understand globalism and we need to act locally.
[03:49:00.018 --> 03:49:03.300]  And as you pointed out, this is not just a problem for the UK or for Britain.
[03:49:03.400 --> 03:49:06.562]  It's something that all countries are being forced to look at.
[03:49:07.102 --> 03:49:09.304]  But we need to understand what the approach is, right?
[03:49:09.344 --> 03:49:16.871]  We need to understand that they're going to erase the borders, they're going to seize control of the economy, and then they're going to shut us down in the name of climate change.
[03:49:16.911 --> 03:49:19.714]  That's what they want to say we should think about locally.
[03:49:19.974 --> 03:49:21.976]  I mean, some of the climate change stuff is just mad.
[03:49:22.757 --> 03:49:25.679]  I mean, here we are effectively wrecking
[03:49:26.440 --> 03:49:35.769]  Our manufacturing industries, when we know that India and China are not going to do anything, it doesn't matter what they say in the Paris Accords, they ain't going to do it!
[03:49:36.790 --> 03:49:42.736]  So we are effectively inflicting wounds on ourselves with this.
[03:49:42.916 --> 03:49:45.178]  So yes, that obviously needs rethinking.
[03:49:46.420 --> 03:49:48.662]  But I think what really, I think economically,
[03:49:49.389 --> 03:49:57.979]  I think the absolute key to all of this is, do you know the Goldman Sachses, the, in the case of Europe, the Siemens Engineering in Germany?
[03:49:58.880 --> 03:50:00.022]  They love the EU model.
[03:50:00.962 --> 03:50:02.083]  Alright, we're coming up to a break.
[03:50:02.103 --> 03:50:05.126]  We're going to finish the rest of this interview when we come back from the break.
[03:50:05.366 --> 03:50:07.308]  Again, that's Nigel Farage that you're listening to.
[03:50:07.808 --> 03:50:09.349]  I talked to him in Las Vegas.
[03:50:09.850 --> 03:50:21.060]  The man who's behind Brexit, pointing out that what we see now is a global movement in all these different countries, a movement for independence from this global corporatism that we see over and over again.
[03:50:21.140 --> 03:50:23.261]  Of course, it was Nigel Farage who went to the EU
[03:50:24.302 --> 03:50:43.238]  And as they had deposed the democratically elected government there, replaced the president with a Goldman Sachs banker, you know the same people that Hillary Clinton makes so much money speaking to in private, and now we see what she's telling them, that her dream is of a hemispheric common market here in the United States, and then goes on to define the North American Union?
[03:50:43.819 --> 03:50:46.921]  When that happened, he went to the EU and he said, who are you?
[03:50:47.702 --> 03:50:55.706]  To depose a democratically elected representative here in the very country, Greece, where democracy first began.
[03:50:56.046 --> 03:50:57.307]  That's what we're seeing, folks.
[03:50:57.787 --> 03:50:58.728]  Are we going to fight this?
[03:50:58.908 --> 03:51:04.991]  We have to understand what their long-term goals are, and we understand that right here in America, the tactic to defeat them is to vote for Trump.
[03:51:05.011 --> 03:51:05.351]  Stay with us.
[03:51:05.371 --> 03:51:07.933]  We'll be right back with the rest of that interview with Nigel Farage.
[03:51:10.925 --> 03:51:21.130]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[03:51:21.691 --> 03:51:33.357]  And others who are kind of at the very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign in ways it's a... or even the recent choices of campaign management.
[03:51:33.657 --> 03:51:38.779]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle, as we've been chronicling here.
[03:51:38.819 --> 03:51:39.300]  Jones is the...
[03:51:40.180 --> 03:51:43.962]  Conspiracy theorist and creator of the fringe website InfoWars.
[03:51:44.322 --> 03:51:47.344]  Do you also know that Hillary Clinton uses a wheelchair?
[03:51:48.404 --> 03:51:54.467]  Her personal vehicle has had to be outfitted with a wheelchair lift because she is not a person who can actually walk.
[03:51:55.247 --> 03:51:58.349]  She secretly uses a wheelchair all those times you think you've seen her walking.
[03:51:58.369 --> 03:51:59.289]  She hasn't been walking.
[03:51:59.509 --> 03:52:00.030]  Did you know that?
[03:52:00.890 --> 03:52:03.851]  Hillary Clinton has been on the campaign trail for 18 months.
[03:52:03.891 --> 03:52:06.493]  Her energy staggers me.
[03:52:07.193 --> 03:52:08.754]  I have a hard time keeping up with her.
[03:52:13.251 --> 03:52:17.792]  The historical first in electing the first conspiracy freak president.
[03:52:18.052 --> 03:52:19.532]  He's not pivoting for presidential.
[03:52:19.752 --> 03:52:21.373]  He's pivoting to Alex Jones.
[03:52:21.393 --> 03:52:22.733]  He's pivoting to crazy.
[03:52:23.233 --> 03:52:27.754]  Was Hillary wearing an earpiece during last night's presidential forum?
[03:52:28.634 --> 03:52:37.776]  That is the pilot, the captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership, Alex Jones.
[03:52:37.796 --> 03:52:39.896]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you Alex?
[03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:42.470]  The plan was so simple.
[03:52:42.570 --> 03:52:46.473]  All Hillary had to do was open a jar of pickles, and the White House would be all ours.
[03:52:46.493 --> 03:52:49.395]  You're gonna be part of the conspiracy now, you realize that, right?
[03:52:49.435 --> 03:52:50.396]  I'm gonna try to do my best.
[03:52:50.596 --> 03:52:52.317]  Alex Jones is gonna be all over you!
[03:52:52.337 --> 03:52:53.098]  Let's see what happens.
[03:52:53.118 --> 03:52:53.959]  Okay, here we go.
[03:52:54.739 --> 03:52:55.220]  Here it is.
[03:52:55.900 --> 03:52:56.561]  Whoop blitzer.
[03:52:57.321 --> 03:52:57.681]  Oh no!
[03:52:59.663 --> 03:53:06.368]  Oh, there was a... They're all in on this, on this total conspiracy theory that literally came from Infowars.
[03:53:06.708 --> 03:53:08.610]  First of all, Hayes, I'll get you for this segment.
[03:53:09.520 --> 03:53:13.662]  It may take years and cost thousands of lives, but I'll get you for this.
[03:53:14.022 --> 03:53:23.826]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[03:53:25.107 --> 03:53:27.188]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[03:53:30.429 --> 03:53:33.391]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:53:33.411 --> 03:53:35.471]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:53:35.912 --> 03:53:38.793]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:53:39.733 --> 03:53:49.785]  And it matters, because it's not just the kook fringe, it's not just the sort of remunerative conspiracy theory world of that part of the conservative media machine.
[03:53:50.065 --> 03:53:55.031]  It's not even just wacky people who have made their way into Republican politics at a surprising height.
[03:53:55.271 --> 03:53:57.013]  This is now the top of the Republican ticket.
[03:54:20.546 --> 03:54:21.727]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:21.787 --> 03:54:25.748]  I'm David Knight and we've been playing the interview with Nigel Farage, the full interview.
[03:54:25.788 --> 03:54:32.671]  We had the partial interview where he was talking about what was coming up that night on the debate and this was in Las Vegas.
[03:54:32.751 --> 03:54:36.733]  But take a look at this full interview because Nigel Farage breaks down the fact.
[03:54:37.313 --> 03:54:38.374]  This is a global movement.
[03:54:38.415 --> 03:54:51.670]  He talks about the strategy, the long-term strategy of the globalists that Hillary certainly understands and she repeated that to them so they know that she's on the same page to them talking about hemispheric unions that are the stepping stone to a global union.
[03:54:52.270 --> 03:54:57.735]  But he also talks about the tactics that they're using in terms of the media establishment, the polling, that sort of thing.
[03:54:57.775 --> 03:54:58.416]  It's a great interview.
[03:54:58.436 --> 03:54:59.877]  We're going to continue that, play the rest of it.
[03:55:00.157 --> 03:55:02.540]  You can find it on Alex Jones' channel.
[03:55:02.580 --> 03:55:03.360]  It's Emergency.
[03:55:03.921 --> 03:55:06.743]  The man behind Brexit issues a warning for America.
[03:55:06.763 --> 03:55:08.085]  We're going to go back to that in just a moment.
[03:55:08.125 --> 03:55:11.468]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know that we now have Living Defense back in stock.
[03:55:11.528 --> 03:55:14.370]  It's been sold out for weeks, but it's now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:15.111 --> 03:55:19.798]  We also have a special on Brain Force, however, that is about to run out.
[03:55:19.838 --> 03:55:23.643]  That's 25% off Brain Force at Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:23.964 --> 03:55:25.206]  That'll be ending very soon.
[03:55:25.606 --> 03:55:29.752]  And of course, also, we're going to be ending the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[03:55:30.393 --> 03:55:34.217]  This is our final inventory that we have of these t-shirts.
[03:55:34.257 --> 03:55:35.599]  We're selling them at cost.
[03:55:35.619 --> 03:55:42.326]  They're going to be discontinued after the election, and I think it truly has become the icon of this election, and rightfully so.
[03:55:42.886 --> 03:55:49.413]  Because this election, fundamentally, folks, is about the corruption that Hillary Clinton is the very embodiment of.
[03:55:50.034 --> 03:56:07.824]  The fact that she can break the law with multiple felony violations and the head of the FBI, not the whole FBI, but the head of the FBI, who has been in her pocket for years, even doing her taxes at the law firm where Loretta Lynch and James Comey used to be partners, they did her taxes!
[03:56:08.715 --> 03:56:18.242]  For a long time, and then of course he was on the board of HSBC at the time they were laundering money for El Chapo and the Sinaloa drug cartel.
[03:56:18.262 --> 03:56:24.066]  They've been convicted two times, but they don't go to prison because then his other partner in crime, Loretta Lynch, lets them go.
[03:56:24.146 --> 03:56:25.367]  They're too big to jail.
[03:56:25.427 --> 03:56:26.908]  Not only too big to fail, but too big to jail.
[03:56:26.928 --> 03:56:27.848]  So that's the corporation.
[03:56:28.309 --> 03:56:32.552]  The corruption, it's not a corporation, but I guess you could call it Clinton Inc.
[03:56:33.152 --> 03:56:37.573]  You know, this massive RICO organization that we are fighting now.
[03:56:37.693 --> 03:56:42.114]  And so I think the Hillary for President is the perfect way to remember this election.
[03:56:42.214 --> 03:56:43.155]  Your souvenir.
[03:56:43.195 --> 03:56:43.695]  You can get these.
[03:56:43.775 --> 03:56:44.575]  It's our final inventory.
[03:56:44.595 --> 03:56:45.695]  They're going to be out pretty soon.
[03:56:45.735 --> 03:56:52.437]  Let's go ahead and finish the rest of this interview with Nigel Farage, the man behind Brexit, warning America what's coming.
[03:56:52.998 --> 03:56:54.699]  We are not living in capitalism.
[03:56:55.099 --> 03:56:58.620]  We are living in an age of global corporatism.
[03:56:59.080 --> 03:57:00.541]  It is an entirely different thing.
[03:57:01.041 --> 03:57:15.627]  And what I want to see, I want to see a situation, and certainly Ronnie Reagan in this country would have been advocating this if he was alive today, I want to see a situation where actually we remove those barriers, we remove excessive
[03:57:16.127 --> 03:57:17.768]  That's one little example for you.
[03:57:47.963 --> 03:57:50.164]  Absolutely.
[03:57:50.224 --> 03:57:52.425]  And it's happening across a whole range of industries.
[03:57:53.285 --> 03:57:55.566]  And we've seen a little bit of it.
[03:57:56.747 --> 03:57:59.628]  Once or twice Trump has mentioned some of this stuff.
[03:57:59.888 --> 03:58:05.891]  But I think we need to sort of start getting the ghosts of Thatcher
[03:58:06.671 --> 03:58:07.072]  I think?
[03:58:23.999 --> 03:58:24.459]  Yeah, sure.
[03:58:24.539 --> 03:58:25.880]  Okay, we're going to stop it right there.
[03:58:25.900 --> 03:58:27.220]  Of course, that's Nigel Farage.
[03:58:27.240 --> 03:58:30.742]  You can see the rest of that interview at Alex Jones' YouTube channel.
[03:58:31.082 --> 03:58:38.605]  You know, when he talks about how they cut off everything for the small guy, it's even mid-sized regional banks that they do that with the Dodd-Frank.
[03:58:38.625 --> 03:58:41.006]  They destroy their competition for the biggest banks.
[03:58:41.366 --> 03:58:48.369]  Join us tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News, and again, if you want to get a link to that video, you can go to my Twitter account, at Libertarian.

[03:58:59.635 --> 03:59:00.958]  Wear red on Election Day.
[03:59:01.058 --> 03:59:04.044]  Perhaps the biggest election in American history is just days away.
[03:59:04.184 --> 03:59:05.026]  We know that in past
