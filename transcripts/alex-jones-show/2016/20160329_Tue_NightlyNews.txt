[00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:22.016]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:25.746]  It is Tuesday, March 29th, 2016, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:27.009]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:40.740]  Tonight, one of Germany's top journalists has just admitted that the mainstream media is a total fraud, and they all work for the CIA.
[00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:51.953]  I've been a journalist for about 25 years, and I was educated to lie, to betray, and not to tell the truth to the public.
[00:00:52.153 --> 00:00:57.815]  Meanwhile in China, a newspaper editor has resigned over media control.
[00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:02.737]  Plus, Obama lectures journalists on how to report the news.
[00:01:02.897 --> 00:01:07.498]  A job well done is about more than just handing someone a microphone.
[00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:11.920]  It would be better served if billions of dollars in free media came with serious accountability.
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.821]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:17.222 --> 00:01:20.783]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:07.189]  Well, a top German journalist has come out to tell us all what we already know.
[00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.792]  The mainstream media is completely fake.
[00:03:10.472 --> 00:03:11.673]  This is Dr. Olfcott.
[00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:18.519]  He went on public television stating that he was forced to publish the works of intelligence agents under his own name.
[00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:24.064]  He also added that non-compliance with these orders would result in him losing his job.
[00:03:24.344 --> 00:03:26.205]  He said, we all lie for the CIA.
[00:03:27.086 --> 00:03:34.311]  He said, I've been a journalist for about 25 years and I was educated to lie, to betray, and not to tell the truth to the public.
[00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:37.613]  And of course, he's not the only journalist that's come out making these claims.
[00:03:37.893 --> 00:03:39.034]  But where else do they do this?
[00:03:39.454 --> 00:03:40.755]  Mmm, Communist China!
[00:03:41.155 --> 00:03:52.763]  There was actually a story on the Drudge Report today of a China newspaper editor resigning over media control because last month the president there visited the leading state media organizations
[00:03:53.263 --> 00:04:03.328]  Where he called on them to be surnamed party, which basically means that, above all, they must answer to the party and pump out the propaganda that the state wants them to.
[00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:06.410]  Now, of course, all of this is nothing new to us.
[00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:15.055]  We learned about this propaganda and the control of the media decades ago from the church hearings, and this is Operation Mockingbird.
[00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:29.128]  At the end of World War II, Operation Paperclip was launched by the Office of Strategic Services, the OSS, to smuggle known Nazi war criminals into the United States for recruitment into U.S.
[00:04:29.228 --> 00:04:30.449]  intelligence agencies.
[00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.834]  The Nazis were cleared to work in America after having their backgrounds bleached by the military.
[00:04:37.114 --> 00:04:43.719]  False employment histories were provided and their previous Nazi affiliations were completely removed from the record.
[00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:50.143]  The OSS provided a model for the Central Intelligence Agency that was established in September 1947.
[00:04:51.604 --> 00:04:57.686]  The CIA specialized in propaganda, economic warfare, sabotage, and demolition.
[00:04:57.946 --> 00:05:07.590]  By the early 1950s, they controlled over 25 newspapers and wire agencies, and had 3,000 plus employees engaged in propaganda.
[00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:17.354]  Journalists willing to promote the views of the CIA included members of the New York Times, Time Magazine, Newsweek, The Washington Post, and CBS Television.
[00:05:17.964 --> 00:05:37.336]  And of course, all of this is particularly hilarious considering that the president of the most transparent administration ever was actually lecturing journalists this week on how to do their jobs, telling them that they need to stick away from superficial reporting and an unwillingness to refute untrue statements from political figures.
[00:05:38.057 --> 00:05:41.719]  This is the hallmark of good journalism, false equivalency.
[00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:46.427]  All too often, these days can be a fatal flaw.
[00:05:46.828 --> 00:05:51.389]  A job well done is about more than just handing someone a microphone.
[00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.831]  It would be better served if billions of dollars in free media came with serious accountability.
[00:05:56.552 --> 00:06:01.554]  Especially when politicians do unworkable plans or make promises they can't keep.
[00:06:02.034 --> 00:06:04.375]  And there are reporters here who know they can't keep them.
[00:06:06.425 --> 00:06:07.926]  I know that's a shocking concept.
[00:06:08.487 --> 00:06:13.412]  So this is a president that doesn't really sit down for any hard-hitting interviews with real journalists.
[00:06:13.452 --> 00:06:19.437]  He is interviewed by YouTube stars who post videos of themselves sitting inside a bathtub filled with Froot Loops.
[00:06:19.857 --> 00:06:25.362]  But he is telling the press that they should care more about deep reports than retweets.
[00:06:26.043 --> 00:06:32.309]  And he says he's full on critic mode here saying there's enormous pressure on journalists to fill the void and
[00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:47.395]  Feed the Beast with instant commentary and Twitter rumors and celebrity gossip and softer stories and saying that news organizations need to give more attention to issues of substance as opposed to just what's flashy in the moment.
[00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:59.159]  And of course, journalists out there immediately retaliated against these claims because, like I said, he has not been the most transparent administration ever, but of course, he has
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.620]  I think.
[00:07:20.077 --> 00:07:29.987]  To search Clinton's emails when Judicial Watch's FOIA request came in because her emails were not in the agency's possession and control at the time.
[00:07:30.007 --> 00:07:42.899]  It wasn't until December 2014 that Clinton turned over a portion of her email archive to State at the agency's request and of course that was after she deleted her yoga workout schedule.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:51.067]  So, of course, there's a big reason right there why Clinton would set up her own private email server because it's not going to be subject to FOIA requests.
[00:07:51.187 --> 00:07:56.292]  And now we've got a second judge coming down and saying, you know what, I think we need to investigate a little further.
[00:07:56.772 --> 00:07:57.453]  But that's not all.
[00:07:57.773 --> 00:08:07.422]  The most transparent administration ever, of course, has been really infamous in prosecuting whistleblowers and, of course, spying on those whistleblowers.
[00:08:07.922 --> 00:08:10.224]  And journalists like Cheryl Atkisson.
[00:08:10.664 --> 00:08:16.849]  She's an investigative journalist, she formerly worked for CBC News, and she is also a whistleblower.
[00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:20.932]  There's videos of her where she's showing her laptop being taken over.
[00:08:21.773 --> 00:08:32.061]  She's not even touching it, but you're actually seeing her files being deleted remotely from whoever from the State Department had been hacking in and spying on her as one of the journalists there.
[00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:36.323]  She was actually giving this really hard-hitting TED Talk last year.
[00:08:36.704 --> 00:08:38.225]  You've got to watch this video in full.
[00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:46.289]  But she's talking about how there are AstroTurf campaigns set up, funded by political, corporate, and other special interest groups.
[00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.653]  And they very effectively go out there and distort media messages.
[00:08:52.737 --> 00:08:56.198]  AstroTurfers seek to controversialize those who disagree with them.
[00:08:56.839 --> 00:09:08.883]  They attack news organizations that publish stories they don't like, whistleblowers who tell the truth, politicians who dare to ask the tough questions, and journalists who have the audacity to report on all of it.
[00:09:10.184 --> 00:09:21.188]  Sometimes AstroTurfers simply shove intentionally so much confusing and conflicting information into the mix that you're left to throw up your hands and disregard all of it, including the truth.
[00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:43.902]  So of course she talks about how these groups will go out there and they'll distort any information and anything that is counter to what the government wants to put out will be silenced, much like the Vax documentary that's been in the news, how Robert De Niro wanted to put it into the Tribeca Film Festival and then of course he had a lot of instantaneous pushback from that and just within hours
[00:09:44.182 --> 00:09:49.504]  So, decided to pull that from the Film Fest because, of course, that's one of those things that Sheryl Atkinson talks about.
[00:09:49.764 --> 00:09:54.805]  You're not allowed to talk about things that will counter the science that the government wants to put out.
[00:09:55.305 --> 00:10:07.469]  Now, here is an article from a couple of years ago, but I highly recommend you go back, take a look at it in full, because it really breaks down a lot of the slides that were released there with the NSA, with the Edward Snowden revelations.
[00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:10.250]  And this is out of Georgie B.C.'
[00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.610]  's blog.
[00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.951]  Heather Marsh is the investigative reporter here.
[00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:18.898]  And she really breaks down these slides and shows you how the democracy is a puppet show.
[00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.982]  It's set up to distract attention from the real governance.
[00:10:22.463 --> 00:10:28.591]  Democracy and local governments provide a curtain between the true coercive power and the rest of the people.
[00:10:29.151 --> 00:10:31.914]  A politician or ruler will be placed on stage.
[00:10:32.174 --> 00:10:36.418]  People are made to feel that they're participating in the show by voting for or against.
[00:10:36.838 --> 00:10:40.201]  Occasionally they can throw a shoe at them or potentially assassinate them.
[00:10:40.622 --> 00:10:42.223]  But then the people leave the theater.
[00:10:42.503 --> 00:10:51.291]  They go to the streets where they are the targets of an increasingly oppressive war of coercion by those who are battling for the control of the real governance.
[00:10:51.611 --> 00:10:53.733]  And these are NSA slides and they are
[00:10:54.574 --> 00:11:09.145]  Spelling it out, how to use social media and real-time monitoring of YouTube videos and blogs that you visit and all these things and how they can control your likes, control the things that you are viewing in order to
[00:11:09.745 --> 00:11:10.985]  We're good to go.
[00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:38.432]  I think so.
[00:11:58.746 --> 00:12:01.667]  Or they're talking about the battle between the wives.
[00:12:01.787 --> 00:12:02.648]  Who's prettier?
[00:12:02.668 --> 00:12:03.849]  This and that.
[00:12:04.049 --> 00:12:05.810]  And now are we attacking women?
[00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.770]  Is that what we're doing?
[00:12:07.111 --> 00:12:08.812]  And Kurt Nimmo has got a great article up.
[00:12:09.112 --> 00:12:10.813]  This is the wife war distraction.
[00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:13.655]  People don't need to be worried about whose wife is prettier.
[00:12:13.955 --> 00:12:17.977]  They need to be actually looking at Heidi Cruz's globalist connections.
[00:12:18.297 --> 00:12:21.019]  This is what the Trump campaign should really be hammering about.
[00:12:21.079 --> 00:12:22.240]  Not if she's pretty or not.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.762]  And this is Katrina Pearson, who's Trump's spokeswoman.
[00:12:27.222 --> 00:12:29.123]  She says Heidi Cruz is a Bush operative.
[00:12:29.203 --> 00:12:33.424]  She worked for the architect of NAFTA, which has killed millions of jobs in this country.
[00:12:33.765 --> 00:12:38.347]  She was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and she's been working for Goldman Sachs.
[00:12:38.627 --> 00:12:41.828]  Heidi's entire career has been spent working against
[00:12:42.088 --> 00:12:45.151]  Everything Ted Cruz says that he stands for.
[00:12:45.652 --> 00:12:47.414]  And that article really breaks it down.
[00:12:47.454 --> 00:12:49.176]  You've got to go read Kurt Nimmo's article.
[00:12:49.216 --> 00:12:52.199]  That's what you need to be tweeting out to everyone with this campaign.
[00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.181]  But just keep it all in mind.
[00:12:54.481 --> 00:12:56.523]  This is how the media is controlling you.
[00:12:56.924 --> 00:13:02.370]  And who's behind the media are the people who are ultimately looking for the real governance of this country.
[00:13:03.206 --> 00:13:14.117]  I've been a journalist for about 25 years, and I was educated to lie, to betray, and not to tell the truth to the public.
[00:13:14.517 --> 00:13:16.499]  And now a message for the sheeple.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.945]  Lies upon lies are churning out of mainstream media on a daily basis.
[00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:25.929]  Lies shuffled in with distractions and biased reporting.
[00:13:26.289 --> 00:13:40.699]  A propaganda machine run by the CIA since, at the very least, the 1950s, and owned by the big banks that have given a handful of consolidated media corporations a license to kill any truth in journalism.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:54.029]  Drown out a link between a medicine and a harmful side effect, say vaccines and autism, by throwing a bunch of conflicting paid-for studies, surveys, and experts into the mix, confusing the truth beyond recognition.
[00:13:54.522 --> 00:14:04.386]  That's right, in 2013, while America slept, the Smith-Bundt Act, a decades-old anti-propaganda legislation, was quietly assassinated.
[00:14:04.706 --> 00:14:09.948]  And the absence of the Bulwark Bill is becoming increasingly apparent and dangerous.
[00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:20.515]  As a false narrative of reality is blended in with the growing criminal policies of the Obama administration and his United Nations backed refugees invasion agenda.
[00:14:20.795 --> 00:14:26.899]  Of course, if your entire administration is a lie, lecturing the American people just comes naturally.
[00:14:27.239 --> 00:14:34.384]  When our elected officials and our political campaigns become entirely untethered,
[00:14:36.482 --> 00:14:53.811]  To reason and facts and analysis when it doesn't matter what's true and what's not, that makes it all but impossible for us to make good decisions on behalf of future generations.
[00:14:54.383 --> 00:15:00.728]  The President's Justice Department sold weapons to narco-terrorists south of our border who killed one of our finest.
[00:15:01.488 --> 00:15:06.872]  The President's State Department lied about Benghazi with false information provided by the White House.
[00:15:07.593 --> 00:15:16.480]  The President's Attorney General authorized spying on a Fox News journalist and his family for reporting on a North Korean nuclear test.
[00:15:17.523 --> 00:15:25.166]  The President's Justice Department confiscated phone records of the Associated Press because they reported on a thwarted terrorist attack.
[00:15:26.066 --> 00:15:31.448]  The President's Treasury Department uses the IRS to target political opposition.
[00:15:32.659 --> 00:15:47.402]  The President's Health and Human Services Secretary pressures the insurance companies she is supposed to regulate to promote Obamacare, which is the same law she uses to force citizens to pay for abortion-inducing drugs against their religious liberties.
[00:15:47.942 --> 00:15:57.164]  Mr. Speaker, the President's dishonesty, incompetence, vengefulness, and lack of moral compass lead many to suggest that he is not fit to lead.
[00:15:58.024 --> 00:16:02.968]  The only problem is that his vice president is equally unfit and even more embarrassing.
[00:16:03.208 --> 00:16:11.155]  This explains why Hillary Clinton can run a campaign for president ignoring a laundry list of potential indictments.
[00:16:11.555 --> 00:16:21.344]  This explains the accepted narrative deeming Donald Trump a racist because he dared bring the threat of radical Islam to the national stage.
[00:16:21.864 --> 00:16:26.268]  This is what elite mafia controlling reality looks like.
[00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:31.409]  When I was at CNN, eventually it got almost impossible to get stories on about Bahrain.
[00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:38.970]  And then in June, our documentary, the 20 minutes of it, was a pretty stark report on the abuse in Bahrain.
[00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.110]  It aired in the U.S.
[00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.871]  for one day, but it never aired to its target audience.
[00:16:43.951 --> 00:16:46.911]  And that's on CNN International in Bahrain.
[00:16:47.051 --> 00:16:54.013]  And Alex, I started getting employees at CNN, longtime employees, approaching me saying, you should investigate this.
[00:16:54.073 --> 00:16:55.793]  This is very suspicious.
[00:16:56.033 --> 00:16:57.114]  There's some things going on here.
[00:16:57.134 --> 00:16:59.016]  I felt defrauded as a journalist.
[00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:16.270]  We found out that at the same time I was being detained and risking my life to expose the Bafrain regime, CNN International is taking money from them in exchange for producing content that it airs on CNN International, content disguised as news.
[00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:22.495]  I mean, one of these programs, the reporter Richard Quest was reporting live from Bafrain for a week.
[00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:25.277]  And on a program called I-List.
[00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:32.344]  And that program made Bob Reagan seem progressive, and like the Crown Prince was a reformer.
[00:17:32.944 --> 00:17:37.809]  And as an employee at CNN, I was never told that this was going on.
[00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:48.119]  Also, viewers are not being told that CNN is being paid by state regimes, some with horrific human rights records, to air content
[00:17:48.679 --> 00:17:55.741]  Disguised as news, which they're often not even telling the viewers that this content was paid for by governments.
[00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:59.142]  And Alex, on a journalistic level, this is horrific.
[00:17:59.342 --> 00:18:04.563]  The lifespan of a major news story is equivalent to that of a common housefly.
[00:18:04.763 --> 00:18:07.604]  Any lingering questions are quickly buried.
[00:18:07.884 --> 00:18:11.325]  And by now, civilization has become accustomed to it.
[00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:23.643]  By unleashing complete chaos and controlling the narrative, a full-scale slow-motion soft war has been waged, funded, and promoted by our own enslaved ignorance.

[00:18:26.857 --> 00:18:35.323]  Well, following those vicious attacks in Pakistan that killed up to 70 people on Easter Sunday, ISIS has more plans to attack children.
[00:18:35.343 --> 00:18:40.927]  We'll give you more on that, but first, Rob Due is on the ground at the Trump rally in Wisconsin.
[00:18:40.967 --> 00:18:41.728]  That's coming right up.
[00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.791]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very, very carefully.
[00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:14.474]  Because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many, many people around me.
[00:19:15.014 --> 00:19:21.437]  I was a big sports enthusiast, but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old, up to about 22 or so.
[00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:28.102]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[00:19:28.262 --> 00:19:34.408]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work, I stopped working out.
[00:19:34.568 --> 00:19:39.193]  And everything was okay for four or five years, but then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month.
[00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:43.096]  And in the next 10 years, I gained almost 100 pounds.
[00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:56.459]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances, and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight, and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.040]  I even changed my diet.
[00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.742]  I even increased the exercise.
[00:19:59.762 --> 00:20:00.303]  It didn't work.
[00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:06.190]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed
[00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:08.177]  My whole life changed.
[00:20:08.798 --> 00:20:14.844]  I've gone from 200 and almost 80 pounds down to about 220 pounds or so.
[00:20:15.445 --> 00:20:16.446]  It is incredible.
[00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:24.635]  And in just the last three years, Super Male Vitality, developed by Dr. Grube for mfulworthslife.com exclusively,
[00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:32.462]  And products like the Survival Shield X2 Nascent Ionine have just done incredible things for my body.
[00:20:32.623 --> 00:20:40.090]  I work out less, even though I'm older, I've lost more weight, my muscles got stronger, my stamina, my libido, and so much more.

[00:23:04.457 --> 00:23:06.479]  Rob Dew has to change out cameras here in a minute.
[00:23:06.499 --> 00:23:10.142]  The battery's going down, so we're going to get as much of the interview as we can now.
[00:23:10.922 --> 00:23:18.488]  They are there in Janesville, Wisconsin, site of where Trump is going to be speaking coming up in a little while.
[00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:20.790]  Rob Dew, tell us what's coming up, my friend.
[00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:28.396]  Yes, this is Rob Dew reporting live from Janesville, Wisconsin, where the Trump rally is going to take place at this Holiday Inn Express to my left.
[00:23:28.886 --> 00:23:31.448]  Uh, Donald Trump is a racist.
[00:23:31.528 --> 00:23:33.329]  That's clear and simple.
[00:23:33.349 --> 00:23:35.910]  He makes these accusations about people that are
[00:23:48.487 --> 00:23:50.749]  Do you have any specifics that you can give me?
[00:24:11.098 --> 00:24:11.798]  You know, patrol.
[00:24:12.299 --> 00:24:13.139]  That was Ted Cruz, I think.
[00:24:13.159 --> 00:24:15.080]  But I think Donald Trump said something similar.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.341]  You know, it's the same thing, I guess.
[00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:19.282]  Okay, but come on now.
[00:24:20.222 --> 00:24:24.344]  He said he wants to stop immigrants coming in.
[00:24:24.824 --> 00:24:26.925]  He said he wants to vet immigrants.
[00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:28.406]  He said there's nothing wrong with having immigrants.
[00:24:28.426 --> 00:24:29.106]  He just wants to vet them.
[00:24:29.685 --> 00:24:29.865]  What?
[00:24:30.466 --> 00:24:31.186]  Oh, oh no!
[00:24:31.366 --> 00:24:31.746]  No, no, no.
[00:24:31.806 --> 00:24:32.707]  He said, he said, no.
[00:24:32.847 --> 00:24:33.487]  And I remember this.
[00:24:33.788 --> 00:24:40.392]  He said specifically, we're going to, we're going to shut down immigration until we figure out what's going on.
[00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:41.232]  Exactly.
[00:24:41.332 --> 00:24:50.478]  The head of Homeland Security and the FBI said we don't, we can't properly vet Syrian refugees coming into this country and from other Muslim places.
[00:24:50.598 --> 00:24:53.339]  Italy just closed three of its borders with Albania.
[00:24:53.439 --> 00:24:54.220]  Explain this to the idiot.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.541]  Is Italy racist?
[00:24:55.561 --> 00:24:58.022]  The Homeland Security, they're scared of everyone, right?
[00:24:58.543 --> 00:25:04.767]  I mean, they're looking at your emails, they're looking at my emails, like, so... Okay, what about Macedonia just put up a border wall for migrants?
[00:25:04.847 --> 00:25:10.210]  Macedonia, they just put up a border fence, essentially, to keep migrants coming out, because they're being flooded and it's destroying their country.
[00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:11.992]  Does that make it okay?
[00:25:12.372 --> 00:25:13.453]  Well, that doesn't make them racist.
[00:25:13.473 --> 00:25:14.633]  Ask if the city has a front door.
[00:25:14.653 --> 00:25:15.514]  Ask if it has a door.
[00:25:15.534 --> 00:25:16.335]  That doesn't make them racist.
[00:25:16.355 --> 00:25:18.216]  But the comments that you're making are racist.
[00:25:18.276 --> 00:25:19.036]  Ask if it has a door.
[00:25:19.116 --> 00:25:19.597]  That's what they are.
[00:25:20.297 --> 00:25:29.144]  Now, I think what's going on is there's racial division being propagated by a man named George Soros, who you're spotting a lot of his talking points, unfortunately.
[00:25:29.205 --> 00:25:33.228]  He's a billionaire, and you're here against billionaires, but George Soros is a billionaire.
[00:25:33.368 --> 00:25:37.912]  George Soros is, yeah, sure, but- Ask him if he has a front door, it's the same as offense.
[00:25:37.932 --> 00:25:40.834]  Is there any difference between George Soros and Donald Trump?
[00:25:40.874 --> 00:25:44.477]  No, they're just the same side, they're two different sides of the same coin.
[00:25:44.817 --> 00:25:46.579]  But you're spouting his talking points.
[00:25:46.599 --> 00:25:48.941]  Does George Soros care about-
[00:25:49.461 --> 00:25:51.702]  Ask Ronald McDonald if he has a door.
[00:25:51.782 --> 00:25:52.663]  Ask if he has a door.
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.201]  Does he have a door on his house?
[00:26:21.681 --> 00:26:24.343]  Is there a fence on his yard?
[00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:28.065]  Wealth inequality has gone up over the last 50 years immensely.
[00:26:28.085 --> 00:26:35.129]  And it's because of guys like George Soros and Donald Trump who take jobs out of America and put them into... Actually, Bill Clinton helped take jobs out of America.
[00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:36.810]  That's just a moron and he has a door on his house.
[00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:38.090]  He's a neoliberal Democrat.
[00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.652]  Alright, um, Alex wants to know if you have a door on your house.
[00:26:42.053 --> 00:26:43.974]  Alex Jones is talking to you right there through that camera.
[00:26:43.994 --> 00:26:46.175]  He wants to know if you have a door on your house.
[00:26:46.695 --> 00:26:47.596]  Or a fence in your yard.
[00:26:49.329 --> 00:26:50.591]  Um, I live with my parents.
[00:26:50.631 --> 00:26:50.711]  I'm 18.
[00:26:50.771 --> 00:26:51.672]  I'm in high school.
[00:26:51.992 --> 00:26:53.755]  But you have a door in your house, right?
[00:26:54.395 --> 00:26:55.717]  Is this what conservatives do?
[00:26:55.797 --> 00:26:56.838]  Is they get online?
[00:26:56.858 --> 00:26:58.440]  We're liberals, dumbass.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.321]  We're the real deal.
[00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:00.582]  We're here to save the country, punk.
[00:27:00.603 --> 00:27:01.804]  We built it.
[00:27:01.904 --> 00:27:03.406]  We're the renaissance.
[00:27:03.446 --> 00:27:04.006]  We did it all.
[00:27:04.127 --> 00:27:04.607]  You're an idiot.
[00:27:06.713 --> 00:27:07.033]  Sure.
[00:27:07.373 --> 00:27:07.573]  Okay.
[00:27:07.873 --> 00:27:09.554]  So then what's wrong with having that at your country?
[00:27:09.954 --> 00:27:10.154]  What?
[00:27:10.734 --> 00:27:12.194]  Again, we're not being mean to them, folks.
[00:27:12.214 --> 00:27:13.695]  They're storming the event and stuff.
[00:27:13.935 --> 00:27:15.455]  These groups have been Soros-funded, Hillary-funded.
[00:27:15.475 --> 00:27:16.475]  They've been caught trying to violate.
[00:27:16.515 --> 00:27:17.156]  Let's talk to this moron.
[00:27:17.176 --> 00:27:17.776]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:17.796 --> 00:27:18.256]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:18.276 --> 00:27:18.736]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:18.756 --> 00:27:19.576]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:19.596 --> 00:27:20.056]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:20.076 --> 00:27:20.476]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:20.496 --> 00:27:20.936]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:20.956 --> 00:27:21.497]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:21.517 --> 00:27:22.057]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:22.077 --> 00:27:22.497]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:22.517 --> 00:27:22.937]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:22.957 --> 00:27:23.617]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:23.637 --> 00:27:24.157]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:24.197 --> 00:27:24.777]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:24.797 --> 00:27:25.338]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:25.358 --> 00:27:25.818]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:25.838 --> 00:27:26.258]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:26.278 --> 00:27:26.698]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:26.718 --> 00:27:27.138]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:27.158 --> 00:27:27.938]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:28.498]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:28.518 --> 00:27:29.078]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:29.098 --> 00:27:29.659]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:30.099]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:30.119 --> 00:27:30.679]  No hate in our state!
[00:27:30.699 --> 00:27:31.399]  No hate in our state
[00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:34.620]  I can tell you a little bit about myself if you want.
[00:27:34.821 --> 00:27:35.101]  Sure.
[00:27:35.281 --> 00:27:45.629]  A lot of people have been, like GM and other companies that have left this area and taken away a lot of the jobs, which I think is why you have a lot of disenfranchised people instead of blaming Donald Trump for it, who's actually employed people.
[00:27:45.709 --> 00:27:52.294]  Well, I'm here as a white woman and a mother of two white sons, and I don't want to raise my sons in a world shaped by racism and violence.
[00:27:52.314 --> 00:27:57.057]  And that's the kind of message that Donald Trump has used to empower himself and his base.
[00:27:57.258 --> 00:28:01.181]  Ask her if she knows about tribalism and other groups and if she understands why we have nationalism.
[00:28:02.586 --> 00:28:05.287]  So you think white people are the main problem?
[00:28:05.347 --> 00:28:06.147]  Get these votes!
[00:28:28.479 --> 00:28:29.060]  Are you done?
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.082]  I think she's done.
[00:28:30.382 --> 00:28:31.204]  No, no, let her keep going.
[00:28:31.224 --> 00:28:33.788]  Let's hear the little commie chants and the idiot chants.
[00:28:33.808 --> 00:28:35.471]  I mean, dude, this is pathetic.
[00:28:41.087 --> 00:28:46.808]  Hey, you think we ought to go talk to some of the Donald Trump supporters?
[00:29:10.322 --> 00:29:11.563]  Hey, you wanna interview the Easter Bunny?
[00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:12.984]  You're gonna love this one, Alex.
[00:29:15.006 --> 00:29:16.427]  And I think he's a fan.
[00:29:17.208 --> 00:29:20.511]  Alright, go back and talk to that guy who's like a security guard.
[00:29:20.531 --> 00:29:21.532]  You gotta meet the Easter Bunny.
[00:29:21.552 --> 00:29:23.934]  Alright, we're live on TV.
[00:29:24.814 --> 00:29:25.755]  So tell us why you're here.
[00:29:25.775 --> 00:29:30.679]  Well, I'm here to see a side of insanity here.
[00:29:30.699 --> 00:29:35.864]  I wanted to see how many Democrats were around and how many people were like, for real, going to vote for Trump.
[00:29:36.471 --> 00:29:37.331]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:40.452]  So what's your impression of what you're seeing right now?
[00:29:40.832 --> 00:29:44.353]  I don't know, it's pretty peaceful.
[00:29:44.433 --> 00:29:50.194]  I saw some people trying to instigate earlier, it was people from Trump's camp, but you know, nobody's falling for it.
[00:29:50.374 --> 00:29:51.414]  Ask him if he was ever taking LSD.
[00:29:51.434 --> 00:29:52.675]  Do you think Trump supporters are the problem?
[00:29:53.095 --> 00:29:53.715]  Trump supporters?
[00:29:55.455 --> 00:30:00.416]  No, I mean, I just think they don't know what's going on.
[00:30:01.897 --> 00:30:03.717]  I mean, I really don't understand.
[00:30:04.525 --> 00:30:10.908]  How you could be behind that and sell the presidency and support half of the garbage that he talks.
[00:30:10.948 --> 00:30:14.350]  Hey, ask him why the power elite worldwide and the communist Chinese are against him.
[00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:15.370]  You see it from both sides.
[00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.111]  You see the Republicans and the Democrats hate him.
[00:30:17.511 --> 00:30:19.312]  Wouldn't that make you just want to pause for a second?
[00:30:20.113 --> 00:30:23.594]  Maybe this guy is talking some sense and some on, you know, several levels.
[00:30:23.894 --> 00:30:27.236]  No, he's not speaking... Ask this guy what he thinks of the Manson family.
[00:30:27.276 --> 00:30:30.898]  Actually, I have a conspiracy theory that Hillary paid him to run just because
[00:30:32.655 --> 00:30:33.936]  Months ago it was a joke.
[00:30:33.996 --> 00:30:36.137]  That's what I thought a year ago.
[00:30:36.217 --> 00:30:37.717]  Yeah, you know what, actually we thought that too.
[00:30:37.917 --> 00:30:40.038]  But he has brought out her husband's sexcapades.
[00:30:41.219 --> 00:30:43.580]  Which I think is pretty damaging to what she's doing right now.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.780]  Well, yeah, I suppose so.
[00:30:45.841 --> 00:30:47.601]  I mean, I wouldn't vote for Hillary.
[00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:49.442]  Ask him what he thinks of Charlie Manchin.
[00:30:49.862 --> 00:30:54.664]  Actually, Trump, when he started, it was sort of like a protest run.
[00:30:54.864 --> 00:30:58.846]  As a candidate, I think he was surprised at the number of people... Ask him if he takes LSD in that outfit.
[00:30:58.886 --> 00:30:59.826]  I thought it was a joke.
[00:31:00.607 --> 00:31:01.147]  I really did.
[00:31:02.088 --> 00:31:08.873]  But, Wisconsin for example, obviously there is, there's a history here of people voting against their better interest.
[00:31:10.093 --> 00:31:15.237]  Okay, so Alex wants to know if you take LSD in that bunny suit, what do you think of the Manson family?
[00:31:16.277 --> 00:31:16.518]  Who?
[00:31:17.358 --> 00:31:18.699]  Alex Jones, you're live right now.
[00:31:19.019 --> 00:31:20.140]  Oh, hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.201]  Good, we're doing well.
[00:31:22.475 --> 00:31:23.595]  He said we're doing well.
[00:31:23.675 --> 00:31:24.296]  No, no, no.
[00:31:24.336 --> 00:31:27.497]  I'm not on drugs and I'm not a Manson fan.
[00:31:27.897 --> 00:31:28.637]  What's your job?
[00:31:28.657 --> 00:31:29.938]  What do you do?
[00:31:30.578 --> 00:31:31.078]  I'm an artist.
[00:31:31.158 --> 00:31:31.618]  You're an artist?
[00:31:31.979 --> 00:31:32.199]  Yeah.
[00:31:32.679 --> 00:31:33.399]  Does that surprise you?
[00:31:33.879 --> 00:31:34.479]  No, not at all.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.500]  Show us some of your signs.
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.280]  Let me ask you this.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.140]  Who's more handsome?
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.322]  Emperor Palpatine or Darth Vader?
[00:31:40.342 --> 00:31:41.702]  My favorite Ben Franklin quote.
[00:31:42.022 --> 00:31:43.343]  Oh yeah, he's got a Ben Franklin quote.
[00:31:43.523 --> 00:31:44.823]  Alright, who's more handsome?
[00:31:44.883 --> 00:31:46.524]  Emperor Palpatine or who was the other one?
[00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:49.347]  Who was the other one, Alex?
[00:31:49.367 --> 00:31:49.948]  Darth Vader!
[00:31:50.688 --> 00:31:51.728]  Oh, who's more handsome?
[00:31:51.828 --> 00:31:53.069]  Emperor Palpatine or Darth Vader?
[00:31:54.189 --> 00:31:54.690]  Alex Jones.
[00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:57.151]  Oh, he said Alex Jones!
[00:31:57.251 --> 00:31:58.031]  You won, Alex!
[00:31:58.251 --> 00:31:59.812]  Oh my gosh, this is ridiculous.
[00:31:59.832 --> 00:32:03.873]  Hey, asking this, doesn't he see that Trump is a populist manifestation just like Sanders is?
[00:32:04.213 --> 00:32:06.715]  Whether you support him or not, the power structure is against him.
[00:32:07.415 --> 00:32:09.316]  Alright, I kind of asked him that before.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.442]  So right now, it looks like there's a left and a right populist candidate.
[00:32:14.462 --> 00:32:15.422]  We got Trump and Sanders.
[00:32:15.803 --> 00:32:16.583]  Why do you think that is?
[00:32:16.643 --> 00:32:17.403]  You let me know.
[00:32:17.684 --> 00:32:19.064]  Why do you think that is?
[00:32:19.444 --> 00:32:20.405]  Well, I don't know.
[00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:25.608]  This is the first election in a long time where there's been a full swing of the pendulum.
[00:32:26.448 --> 00:32:33.952]  You know, we had eight years of the far right with Bush, the Bush dynasty continuing, and
[00:32:35.503 --> 00:32:42.227]  Uh, you know, I'm sorry, but I kind of think that our president administration is very centrist at best.
[00:32:42.347 --> 00:32:48.990]  There were a lot of things that President Obama could have done, he should have done, and he didn't.
[00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:51.691]  He played it safe, you know?
[00:32:51.851 --> 00:32:52.392]  And I get that.
[00:32:52.412 --> 00:32:53.472]  Like droning kids?
[00:33:03.556 --> 00:33:06.938]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:14.443]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:33:15.044 --> 00:33:23.409]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:27.772]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:33:28.092 --> 00:33:33.456]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:33:33.676 --> 00:33:34.497]  We're good to go.

[00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:07.152]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:07.413 --> 00:35:21.859]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:22.819]  We're good to go.
[00:35:43.365 --> 00:35:51.211]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:51.371 --> 00:35:56.796]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a 6-day liver detox.
[00:35:56.816 --> 00:36:00.338]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:00.518 --> 00:36:04.522]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:08.545]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:08.865 --> 00:36:09.045]  I'm good.
[00:37:05.336 --> 00:37:23.982]  But the first thing I just want to say here is we had the famous CBS reporter Cheryl Atkinson basically run out of CBS because she did her job and exposed that documents showed the ATF used Fast and Furious to make the case for gun regulations.
[00:37:25.123 --> 00:37:28.464]  Now El Chapo's been found with .50 caliber rifles, you name it.
[00:37:29.284 --> 00:37:33.566]  And the big news today is there's evidence that more guns
[00:37:34.798 --> 00:37:36.500]  Are still being shipped down to Mexico.
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.122]  We should see impeachment over this, shouldn't we?
[00:37:39.983 --> 00:37:45.467]  But we have not seen impeachment over this now.
[00:37:45.487 --> 00:37:53.374]  We're going to go to Kent Terry, brother of the fallen Border Patrol agent, Brian Terry first.
[00:37:53.394 --> 00:38:01.401]  Then we're going to go to an investigator, Matt Smith-Mack, who is a retired
[00:38:02.859 --> 00:38:14.002]  USMC Lieutenant Colonel and an investigator, and has the background to be doing it, who's working with the family, the Border Patrol and others, to bring out exactly what's happening and the ongoing crimes.
[00:38:14.362 --> 00:38:17.663]  So this is a big investigative report today, in the time we have.
[00:38:17.703 --> 00:38:19.664]  I appreciate both men joining us.
[00:38:21.348 --> 00:38:31.077]  Kent Terry, brother of Brian Terry, who died in 2010, will be on first to break down the basics of what happened, for those that may not know, and then what's developed since then.
[00:38:31.097 --> 00:38:33.679]  But reading over all this that you guys sent me...
[00:38:34.773 --> 00:38:44.440]  The fact that he had documents, handwritten notes in his boots hidden, the fact that the Feds came in and took all his materials, the fact that he was warning family that he'd gotten into some serious investigations.
[00:38:45.001 --> 00:38:49.344]  You know, is it more than just some illegal alien drug dealer that shot and killed your brother?
[00:38:49.704 --> 00:38:54.368]  This thing looks like an even bigger cover-up to me, and I know that's the direction this is going.
[00:38:54.388 --> 00:38:55.789]  We're going to break it all down.
[00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:58.370]  Kent Terry, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[00:38:58.391 --> 00:39:00.152]  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
[00:39:00.212 --> 00:39:01.993]  I appreciate it.
[00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:02.854]  Where should we start?
[00:39:04.673 --> 00:39:13.075]  Well, everybody knows that Brian was killed with a fast and furious scandal by the Obama administration.
[00:39:13.595 --> 00:39:18.296]  But the thing is though, the lies that my family's been told from day one.
[00:39:20.456 --> 00:39:24.957]  Since day one, they told us they found three weapons and they apprehended four suspects.
[00:39:25.677 --> 00:39:31.499]  Then within 12 hours later, they only found two weapons and they had to release the suspect.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:41.185]  But we never knew about Fast and Furious until Cheryl Atkinson reached the story, released the story with John Dodson.
[00:39:42.325 --> 00:39:57.114]  But in the meantime, prior to meeting with Cheryl Atkinson and the John Dodson release, Dennis Burke, which was the Attorney General, State Attorney for Arizona, that was involved in Fast and Furious, made an appearance to our house.
[00:39:59.113 --> 00:40:03.374]  Making sure that the weapons that Brian's team were not from Arizona, they're from a store in Texas.
[00:40:03.435 --> 00:40:06.676]  And we're thinking, is this company right with this whole thing?
[00:40:06.756 --> 00:40:13.138]  So when Cheryl asked him on that story out, right there we knew that this was a lie and a big cover-up in Brian's death.
[00:40:15.439 --> 00:40:24.162]  And now you guys have done an intense investigation with Matt Schmithmeck and others, and I just, this is pretty bombshell.
[00:40:24.902 --> 00:40:27.063]  I know he's going to talk about the direction it's pointing, but
[00:40:29.269 --> 00:40:41.913]  In your gut, looking at this, and the way they've changed the story so much, and the fact that he had documents we're going to be showing to the TV part of the audience, you know, basically hidden so they would get to other people if something happened to him.
[00:40:41.953 --> 00:40:45.274]  I mean, this sounds like an action-adventure-whodunit movie to me.
[00:40:46.435 --> 00:40:47.775]  Well, you know what, Mr. Jones?
[00:40:47.815 --> 00:40:49.596]  From day one, I knew something wasn't right.
[00:40:49.716 --> 00:40:54.437]  I mean, especially when he told my mom two months before he got killed that, you know, Mom, I don't want to go back.
[00:40:54.557 --> 00:40:55.777]  Something just doesn't feel right.
[00:40:55.817 --> 00:40:56.678]  I can't talk about it.
[00:40:58.292 --> 00:40:59.552]  My mom was like, Brian, you know what?
[00:40:59.913 --> 00:41:01.293]  If you don't want to go, don't go back.
[00:41:01.313 --> 00:41:02.093]  He goes, well, you know what?
[00:41:02.113 --> 00:41:02.793]  I love my job.
[00:41:02.933 --> 00:41:03.674]  I love this country.
[00:41:04.374 --> 00:41:12.596]  And a year later, when I was going through his materials and his belongings, I went to go try on these pair of boots.
[00:41:12.736 --> 00:41:16.377]  And I thought it was a paper from a brand new pair of boots.
[00:41:16.437 --> 00:41:17.598]  And I pulled out that journal.
[00:41:17.798 --> 00:41:18.738]  I started going through it.
[00:41:18.758 --> 00:41:23.640]  And I'm like, about him intercepting, pulling over people with crate fulls of AK-47s and
[00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:30.017]  You know, he had the GPS coordinates down there and everything, and was told by his supervisor to like, go.
[00:41:30.637 --> 00:41:31.798]  Right there I knew, you know what?
[00:41:33.178 --> 00:41:35.139]  The whole time of Brian's death did not add up.
[00:41:35.859 --> 00:41:48.162]  15 minutes before he got off, the email he wrote to the Border Patrol Union regarding a situation going on in the border, and the Border Patrol Union told us it wasn't about a transfer and it wasn't about a time off, but looked into it.
[00:41:49.823 --> 00:41:52.584]  So, I think Brian was on to Fast and Furious.
[00:41:52.664 --> 00:41:53.964]  I don't think he knew the extent of it.
[00:41:54.733 --> 00:42:01.996]  I don't think he knew how big it really was, but in my gut, the timing of Brian's death does not add up to what the government's telling us.
[00:42:03.037 --> 00:42:22.165]  What was it like for you after December 2010, to then a year later, December 7th, 2011, almost a year to the date, CBS coming out and a valiant reporter documenting that this was a staged deal to blame the Second Amendment and to blame American gun owners for violence in Mexico.
[00:42:22.185 --> 00:42:23.906]  I mean, what was it like when you saw news like that?
[00:42:26.499 --> 00:42:27.019]  I was sick.
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.880]  I was actually sick to my stomach.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:29.901]  I'm like, you know what?
[00:42:30.021 --> 00:42:32.222]  This is what they're going to do to our own people here.
[00:42:32.802 --> 00:42:38.105]  And this is... To me, it was their whole thing about changing the Second Amendment, showing there was a gun problem for the United States.
[00:42:38.525 --> 00:42:40.686]  I think that was their whole idea, what was going on.
[00:42:41.187 --> 00:42:44.308]  But that just made me sick about how they're blaming something else.
[00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:47.090]  And it's just... I don't know.
[00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:48.090]  I feel like I'm in a nightmare.
[00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:49.231]  I still feel like I'm in a nightmare.
[00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:54.914]  Now, I know we've got to go in about 10 minutes, so I'm going to skip this network break coming up because this is so important.
[00:42:54.934 --> 00:43:03.042]  We're talking to Kent Terry, brother of slain hero Brian Terry, who tried to stand up and tell the truth and was clearly basically taken out or hit for it.
[00:43:04.934 --> 00:43:16.322]  You're very, very sad, but thank God he's got a great family, and thank God this information ended up getting out, and there's patriots like Matt Smith-Mack out there, and I know he works with you and the family as a tireless investigator.
[00:43:16.342 --> 00:43:20.325]  I want to bring him in, jump in any time you want, Kent, with points you want to make.
[00:43:20.345 --> 00:43:21.145]  20-year veteran of the U.S.
[00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:32.553]  Marine Corps, EA6B electronic countermeasures officer, attaining rank of Lieutenant Colonel before March 2006, veteran of Desert Shield, Storm, Bosnia campaign, Operation Enduring Freedom.
[00:43:32.793 --> 00:43:33.633]  I'm not going to go over
[00:43:34.514 --> 00:43:38.777]  His whole bio would take about an hour to do that, all the places he's been stationed, what he's been involved in.
[00:43:39.097 --> 00:43:43.280]  But imagine all this background, working with FBI, CIA, DA, you name it.
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.422]  It gives him a background to know what he sees when he sees it.
[00:43:46.002 --> 00:43:47.003]  Amazing info.
[00:43:48.444 --> 00:43:55.009]  How best to break down where your investigation is going, because I see in your notes here you sent me that there's more shipments, it's ongoing.
[00:43:55.389 --> 00:44:00.633]  That is bombshell because, wow, Congress isn't really doing anything.
[00:44:00.673 --> 00:44:02.774]  And if this comes back out, this could really
[00:44:04.396 --> 00:44:08.658]  Yeah, Mr. Jones, hi.
[00:44:08.698 --> 00:44:09.279]  Good afternoon.
[00:44:09.299 --> 00:44:10.540]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.101]  It certainly would.
[00:44:12.461 --> 00:44:19.786]  And dovetailing on what Brian just said, you know, we've been helping and working with the Terry family.
[00:44:20.507 --> 00:44:22.168]  And I think what is important
[00:44:23.157 --> 00:44:25.698]  It's building off of what Brian said.
[00:44:25.718 --> 00:44:37.983]  You still have, there is a central figure that is, since 2012, has been trying to help law enforcement, House Oversight, and Senator Grassley's office.
[00:44:38.703 --> 00:44:44.225]  And interestingly, all of that, there's been a lot of action, but no vector, no direction.
[00:44:45.546 --> 00:44:59.815]  And also, interestingly, a friend of this program, as you know, Tosh Plumlee and I, both from congressional offices, were admonished to stop talking to the Terry family because it was told it was worrisome and unwarranted.
[00:45:00.536 --> 00:45:04.778]  And when I talked to Kent, you know, Kent said, hey, we've never talked to those folks.
[00:45:04.798 --> 00:45:06.179]  We never talked to anybody in Congress.
[00:45:06.219 --> 00:45:08.221]  We haven't we haven't said anything about you guys.
[00:45:08.661 --> 00:45:09.702]  But I find it bizarre.
[00:45:09.722 --> 00:45:13.404]  And I have actually an email from one of the people telling me to essentially back off.
[00:45:13.424 --> 00:45:14.245]  So we found that
[00:45:14.926 --> 00:45:19.480]  Very striking and I think importantly to what what
[00:45:20.214 --> 00:45:21.335]  Brian was on to.
[00:45:21.835 --> 00:45:32.503]  We have, beginning of late last year, let ATF, both in Tucson and the Chicago offices, know that weapons were still going across the border.
[00:45:32.523 --> 00:45:34.044]  We're going to go across in early November.
[00:45:34.364 --> 00:45:38.187]  Matter of fact, they went across on 10 November, the Marine Corps' birthday of all days.
[00:45:39.248 --> 00:45:40.649]  Nothing was done to stop it.
[00:45:40.789 --> 00:45:44.872]  They only met with the central character three days after the fact.
[00:45:45.532 --> 00:46:01.348]  And again, we've also alerted some folks in the congressional side because, you know, talking to a lot of the folks who were lost their jobs or retired or got in trouble over trying to tell the truth on Fast and Furious, you know, we're told do not trust ATF leadership, do not trust DOJ, OIG.
[00:46:01.888 --> 00:46:09.095]  So, ergo, we're trying to work with Congress, House Oversight, Senator Grassley's office of late, sir, actually, Congressman Trey Gowdy.
[00:46:09.676 --> 00:46:15.560]  Who I've received an email from who asked me to certainly forward him everything, you know, always forward to him what I've got.
[00:46:15.781 --> 00:46:16.601]  So I've been doing that.
[00:46:17.102 --> 00:46:26.789]  But again, we've got a mid-May of this year time frame where another large shipment is scheduled to go across from basically Arizona into Mexico.
[00:46:27.509 --> 00:46:30.372]  And we're trying to make sure that does not occur.
[00:46:31.072 --> 00:46:36.956]  And the folks who were involved with this actually have agreed to meet with Kent
[00:46:37.717 --> 00:46:46.160]  This other central figure, and actually an investigative reporter for a major cable news network, to recount everything.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:57.083]  I mean, they have locations, they have names, they have, as John Dodson had talked to me about, get evidence to lay hands on, and hopefully, sir, you know, mid-May, this could come to fruition.
[00:47:03.004 --> 00:47:04.006]  Brain Force is here.
[00:47:04.547 --> 00:47:06.831]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:07.112 --> 00:47:14.966]  You probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:47:15.748 --> 00:47:18.931]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable.
[00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:19.331]  Right?
[00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:21.713]  You're going to crash and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:22.074 --> 00:47:25.597]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:25.657 --> 00:47:28.800]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.104]  We kept changing this formula over and over and over again until it became sort of a grand puzzle.
[00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:36.507]  For example, the L-Theanine inside of it.
[00:47:36.847 --> 00:47:41.271]  That is activated by the different compounds in the Yerba Mate that we put inside of it as well.
[00:47:41.451 --> 00:47:43.512]  This just increases the compounds you already have.
[00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:45.594]  This is what you're actually designed to run on.
[00:47:45.714 --> 00:47:45.954]  Exactly.
[00:47:45.974 --> 00:47:49.797]  It's kind of like a car will run on one form of junky gas, but it runs really good on what it's designed for.
[00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:58.343]  You will find Brain Force, Survival Shield X2, and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:08.239]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:14.564]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:48:14.765 --> 00:48:21.731]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[00:48:22.071 --> 00:48:32.020]  Now, InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:38.505]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutra-medical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:48:38.765 --> 00:48:41.448]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[00:48:42.208 --> 00:48:42.469]  We're good.
[00:49:05.862 --> 00:49:13.444]  Well, according to intelligence officials, ISIS has imminent plans to attack predominantly Jewish children in Turkey.
[00:49:13.864 --> 00:49:20.166]  Now, Sky News reports that six operatives from the terror group, they've been arrested last week.
[00:49:20.226 --> 00:49:22.886]  They revealed information about an imminent attack.
[00:49:23.386 --> 00:49:29.008]  Kindergartens, schools and youth centers for Jewish children are at the center of the plans, according to these reports.
[00:49:29.628 --> 00:49:31.988]  So they said that this is more than a credible threat.
[00:49:32.108 --> 00:49:37.349]  It's an active plot and that it could be within the next 24 hours or the next few days.
[00:49:37.869 --> 00:49:38.450]  And the U.S.
[00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:44.651]  has pulled ambassadors, diplomats and their families out of Turkey after these very credible terror threats.
[00:49:45.071 --> 00:49:52.492]  But it's not just the Jewish faith that ISIS is coming after, of course, but we saw them attacking the Christian faith as well.
[00:49:52.832 --> 00:49:58.153]  Of course, on Easter Sunday, they bombed a playground where people were celebrating
[00:49:58.613 --> 00:50:03.937]  Easter there, 70 people were killed and they said that they were targeting Christians.
[00:50:04.377 --> 00:50:14.104]  Of course they ended up killing a lot of people who are Muslims as well, but these are people who obviously were happy out celebrating the Easter holiday there in Lahore.
[00:50:14.164 --> 00:50:23.170]  So 70 people were killed just to show you how crazy this is and how it's everyone and Mark Zuckerberg says, oh we need to just love them and they'll stop.
[00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:24.351]  Well also,
[00:50:25.131 --> 00:50:33.794]  The young men in Molenbeek district there in Brussels received text messages over the weekend calling on them to make the right choice and fight the Westerners.
[00:50:34.194 --> 00:50:35.814]  So these texts were sent on Sunday.
[00:50:36.154 --> 00:50:43.957]  They were sent from a prepaid account so couldn't be traced or applied to and it followed a video that was put out on Facebook since been removed.
[00:50:44.977 --> 00:51:04.850]  The short text message was written in French and it said, So people don't know how they were able to get these recipients' phone numbers, but some of the community activists believe that ISIS handlers download all the contacts from phone books of new recruits.
[00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:09.074]  And then they select young men of North African origin to follow up.
[00:51:09.174 --> 00:51:10.396]  So there you go.
[00:51:10.476 --> 00:51:16.562]  If you're friends with people who are going to join the Jihad, now they have been able to absorb all of their contacts.
[00:51:16.983 --> 00:51:19.165]  And so you might be getting hit up by ISIS.
[00:51:19.385 --> 00:51:23.810]  So of course, this is brazen because as we know, Molenbeek is under police lockdown.
[00:51:24.611 --> 00:51:25.411]  But that's not all.
[00:51:25.431 --> 00:51:32.714]  To just see how deep this goes, one of the Brussels suspects, the man who surrendered to police on Friday, they shot him in the leg.
[00:51:33.354 --> 00:51:36.015]  He was there at the train station and he was wanting to carry out an attack.
[00:51:36.375 --> 00:51:43.217]  Well, this guy was actually a known figure within the Belgian Jihadi community for his involvement in the September
[00:51:44.217 --> 00:51:50.322]  9th assassination of an Afghan commander who was the last obstacle for the attack on the U.S.
[00:51:50.362 --> 00:51:50.882]  two days later.
[00:51:50.922 --> 00:51:53.284]  So this guy has ties to 9-11.
[00:51:53.644 --> 00:52:00.409]  So that's how far back this goes and how they want to tell you that, you know, let's just love them and give them jobs and they'll change their way.
[00:52:10.779 --> 00:52:14.485]  I had a chance to visit Austin-based video game company, Kingdom Games.
[00:52:14.866 --> 00:52:21.958]  Now, what's interesting about this group is that they provide biblically-based entertainment, with their title, Five, the Guardians of David, out now.
[00:52:22.399 --> 00:52:24.562]  Here's a look at what happened when I went to their studio.
[00:52:25.649 --> 00:52:31.913]  Right away, I found myself in the hot seat, recording lines that they would incorporate into the gameplay.
[00:52:32.094 --> 00:52:35.036]  Normally the voiceover process for a game would be much more involved than this.
[00:52:35.076 --> 00:52:38.478]  We would like, get auditions from a variety of third party providers.
[00:52:38.518 --> 00:52:41.861]  We went through Bay Area Sound for ours, for what's mainly in the game.
[00:52:42.301 --> 00:52:42.761]  That was good.
[00:52:42.801 --> 00:52:46.064]  Maybe one more, with just a little more.
[00:52:46.364 --> 00:52:47.084]  Warriors!
[00:52:48.085 --> 00:52:51.407]  You crave the action, and the action you shall receive.
[00:52:51.868 --> 00:52:53.649]  Warriors begin combat!
[00:52:54.724 --> 00:53:00.726]  Yeah, we're going to try to get a full build of the game put together with that in it before you take off.
[00:53:00.786 --> 00:53:01.167]  Sounds good.
[00:53:01.627 --> 00:53:02.587]  More on that later.
[00:53:03.327 --> 00:53:08.849]  Previously, I spoke in studio with Mike Madden, the Director of Development for Kingdom Games.
[00:53:09.369 --> 00:53:13.611]  Okay, so what spurred you on the route to make a biblically based video game?
[00:53:14.131 --> 00:53:31.662]  You highlighted a lot of it in your opening saying that it's not prevalent there and the founders recognize that in looking at where kids are spending their time and rather than fighting to remove them from that activity, let's take those great historical stories that are just
[00:53:32.202 --> 00:53:37.205]  I think it was a place that we could contribute in a different way and present a different offering and a different option for parents.
[00:53:57.017 --> 00:54:03.740]  Back at the production house, they took us through their studio, explaining the various aspects that make the experience a whole.
[00:54:04.261 --> 00:54:07.342]  So, this level was constructed last week.
[00:54:07.962 --> 00:54:17.047]  It was probably up and running, at least its first iteration was up and running, by I would say two days, or a little less than two days working time.
[00:54:17.927 --> 00:54:20.248]  Each block you see here is one meter by one meter.
[00:54:21.489 --> 00:54:23.350]  It lets us measure out things more accurately.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:29.884]  I'm not sure if this is so much your department, but I'm always curious as to how, you know, video game glitches happen.
[00:54:29.964 --> 00:54:34.528]  You know, a guy just, like, walks into a wall and... Oh, for that one I can tell you it's probably the design.
[00:54:34.568 --> 00:54:38.151]  Yeah, someone like my fault.
[00:54:38.671 --> 00:54:42.174]  Well, so, we have something in most games called collision.
[00:54:42.714 --> 00:54:53.658]  Which is, you can put down this wall, and you can put down the floor, and what a lot of people would think, you know, if they don't know too much about the subject, is that should work.
[00:54:54.098 --> 00:55:00.100]  Like, if I have a player and I put him down here, he's not going to fall through the floor because that's the floor.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:06.562]  But, unless you told, there's something in the computer that told you that's the floor, you know, he will just fall through.
[00:55:06.802 --> 00:55:11.364]  Now before we get into this, when you're talking about designing the art, are you talking about
[00:55:11.784 --> 00:55:14.245]  The character designs, you're talking about the background art.
[00:55:14.665 --> 00:55:15.745]  How encompassing is this?
[00:55:15.985 --> 00:55:16.586]  It's everything.
[00:55:16.746 --> 00:55:17.006]  Okay.
[00:55:17.186 --> 00:55:21.787]  When you set out to build a game, you have to think about the micro and the macro.
[00:55:22.267 --> 00:55:24.768]  What does the world look like from 300 miles?
[00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:27.069]  What does it look like from 3 inches?
[00:55:27.729 --> 00:55:30.050]  What is the level of detail that you want?
[00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:32.631]  This is the art book that we put together for the game.
[00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:36.852]  And we start with characters.
[00:55:37.853 --> 00:55:53.761]  So, with the five, one of the things that we wanted to do, and we picked the five most referenced mighty men from the Bible, and that's why we have Abishai, Jashabim, Shammah, Eleazar, and Benaiah.
[00:55:54.281 --> 00:56:03.586]  Okay, so basically, do you work off, you know, the character sketches, you get the character sketches, and how do you go about making this a 3D movable object?
[00:56:03.846 --> 00:56:11.489]  So we generally start, I'll start in a program called ZBrush, where I actually create a digital clay sculpt of the character.
[00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:19.953]  And then from there I'll take it into Maya, where we actually create, use a process called Retopology, where we actually create the low poly mesh that you see within the game.
[00:56:20.633 --> 00:56:27.356]  And from there we create the UVs and the textures, which is going to be the colors that are going to be on top of the wireframe of the character.
[00:56:27.932 --> 00:56:36.713]  With so much competition in the existing market, I wanted to know if Kingdom Games encountered issues with their story being accepted by a mainstream audience.
[00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:40.972]  It's a tough market because the gamer market is not fragmented at all.
[00:56:41.032 --> 00:56:42.833]  It's pretty solid, especially on PC.
[00:56:42.893 --> 00:56:46.215]  There's pretty much Steam, and then Origin is a distant second.
[00:56:47.275 --> 00:56:50.217]  With the Christian gamer market, they're very fragmented.
[00:56:50.397 --> 00:56:53.799]  There's a small group, a couple hundred here, a couple thousand here, a couple hundred here.
[00:56:53.939 --> 00:56:59.922]  So what we found is it's really hard to bring them all into one big group, because everyone's in their own different communities.
[00:57:00.482 --> 00:57:03.944]  And I think you notice that a lot with the different sects of Christianity, you know, Baptist, Lutheran.
[00:57:04.224 --> 00:57:05.605]  There's a lot of fragmentation.
[00:57:06.004 --> 00:57:11.387]  There are definitely people who see what we do and love it, but it's a much smaller group than Steam.
[00:57:11.467 --> 00:57:13.468]  It's like 150 million users or something.
[00:57:13.508 --> 00:57:15.289]  We're dealing with hundreds at a time.
[00:57:15.309 --> 00:57:18.570]  You know, youth groups, churches, it's much more local and grassroots.
[00:57:19.171 --> 00:57:29.356]  And it's not kind of your, what's a good term to, the B-grade games that tend to come out in this genre or this content.
[00:57:29.836 --> 00:57:33.238]  And so we spend a lot of time focusing on things that, you know,
[00:57:34.588 --> 00:57:37.135]  The values of, say, like a Christian market.
[00:57:37.336 --> 00:57:40.484]  How can we get that into a game, but also make sure that it's defined?
[00:57:41.377 --> 00:58:05.755]  So one of the things that we're working on right now is this arena mode that we think is going to be spectacular and provide a unique element to kind of that, you know, 1000 BC time period where King David lived and also give the game player a lot of opportunities and freedom to replay the game and encounter different scenarios that they otherwise wouldn't get
[00:58:06.415 --> 00:58:09.198]  And as far as that voice over from earlier...
[00:58:46.496 --> 00:58:47.181]  Thanks for watching.
[00:58:47.221 --> 00:58:48.812]  We'll see you tomorrow, 7 p.m.
[00:58:48.853 --> 00:58:49.215]  Central.
[00:59:03.843 --> 00:59:05.004]  Knockout is back.
