[00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:22.164]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.224 --> 00:00:24.625]  It is Tuesday, December 6th, 2016.
[00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.247]  I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.347 --> 00:00:27.087]  And I'm Margaret Hale.
[00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.408]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.395]  Tonight, the fake news narrative pushed by the mainstream media continues.
[00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:40.598]  And this time, the UN is getting involved.
[00:00:40.878 --> 00:00:49.945]  And they want YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft to censor what they decide is extremist content from the Internet.
[00:00:50.225 --> 00:01:03.418]  Meanwhile, CNN is running the real fake news as they suggest President-elect Donald Trump will usher in a new dark moment in American history by putting Muslims in internment camps.
[00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.160]  Come on, man.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.565]  Then, new bombshell information about Barack Obama's birth certificate.
[00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:11.546]  I'll give you a hint.
[00:01:11.846 --> 00:01:23.093]  It has nothing to do with Obama being born outside of the United States, but rather compelling evidence of fraud to cover up the identity of Obama's real father.
[00:01:23.313 --> 00:01:26.755]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:28.096]  Who's your daddy?

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:08.908]  Well the establishment worldwide is absolutely in a panic.
[00:03:08.968 --> 00:03:12.951]  We are seeing them take this fake news to the next level.
[00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:19.916]  Now the EU is demanding that social media websites censor fake news within 24 hours.
[00:03:20.457 --> 00:03:21.557]  This is the European Union.
[00:03:21.597 --> 00:03:26.381]  They're demanding Twitter, YouTube, Facebook censor quote illegal hate speech
[00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:27.161]  We're good to go.
[00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:54.676]  And take up their share of responsibility when it comes to phenomena like online radicalization, illegal hate speech or fake news.
[00:03:54.716 --> 00:03:58.857]  This is the EU Justice Commissioner that's telling this to the Financial Times.
[00:03:59.317 --> 00:04:00.837]  So this is chilling.
[00:04:00.857 --> 00:04:04.939]  They're using fake news in the exact same context as jihadist propaganda.
[00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:07.219]  They're saying shut it down within 24 hours.
[00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.220]  It's taking too long.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.140]  We're going to take these matters into our own hands.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.182]  And of course, this fake news controversy is being totally exploited by the mainstream media.
[00:04:15.782 --> 00:04:23.547]  To characterize completely legitimate news sources out there, including even left-wing outlets that are critical of Hillary Clinton, say.
[00:04:23.587 --> 00:04:25.588]  So this is totally dangerous.
[00:04:25.608 --> 00:04:26.949]  They're calling it fake news.
[00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:28.450]  They've taken it to the next level.
[00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:36.775]  And they're absolutely in a panic because they see the effect that alternative media and alternative voices out there have had on their globalist agenda.
[00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:41.718]  And, you know, here, the ultimate fake news channel, CNN, is at it again.
[00:04:42.358 --> 00:04:43.839]  Talk about pumping propaganda.
[00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:49.783]  They actually ran a segment suggesting that Trump is going to be putting Muslims in internment camps.
[00:04:50.403 --> 00:04:51.464]  So this is Monday.
[00:04:51.484 --> 00:05:03.752]  The network ran an entire segment essentially informing its viewership that when Donald Trump becomes president, he will begin a program of rounding up Muslim Americans and placing them in internment camps.
[00:05:04.352 --> 00:05:06.093]  So this is CNN's New Day.
[00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:08.674]  Runs a fear-mongering piece.
[00:05:09.295 --> 00:05:19.780]  The reporter interviewed two Japanese-American women who survived internment camps during World War II, prompting the women to say that they fear a similar thing will happen under Trump's presidency.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.601]  Margaret, my goodness.
[00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:23.882]  So talk about fake news and fear-mongering.
[00:05:23.942 --> 00:05:26.183]  Here we're being told, you know, we need to come together.
[00:05:26.203 --> 00:05:31.706]  Hillary Clinton herself said how dangerous it would be if we didn't, you know, concede the election and all come together.
[00:05:31.726 --> 00:05:32.907]  And here we have
[00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:37.401]  CNN pumping out this propaganda, total fear-mongering.
[00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:39.142]  I couldn't have said it better myself.
[00:05:39.182 --> 00:05:42.744]  Not only are we seeing them pump out fear-mongering, so we have two prongs of this.
[00:05:42.844 --> 00:05:46.606]  First, we have the censorship aspect of it, where they're taking down accounts.
[00:05:46.686 --> 00:05:54.550]  Anybody that suggests real news, people like Bebe Wilhelm, who was talking about the German rape crisis in her town, Facebook immediately takes down her post.
[00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.132]  But we have a second prong to this, where it's all out lies.
[00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:03.876]  You know, God bless these two Japanese-American women that survived internment camps in the 40s.
[00:06:04.157 --> 00:06:05.157]  It was a very horrific time.
[00:06:05.177 --> 00:06:12.043]  But to suggest what they're suggesting, to make that leap about President Trump, is complete and utter garbage.
[00:06:12.123 --> 00:06:12.784]  It's total lies.
[00:06:12.804 --> 00:06:14.145]  This is what one of them had to say.
[00:06:14.225 --> 00:06:19.049]  She's suggesting that, quote, Trump could make a dark moment in history a reality again.
[00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:24.512]  She goes on to say, you have to fight for your civil rights, you can't just sit back and say, I'll let it happen.
[00:06:24.613 --> 00:06:38.322]  They were essentially intimating the fact that Trump would put Muslims in internment camps, which is specifically not true, when the reality is, the reality for example in Germany, that there's actually a very different situation on the ground happening.
[00:06:38.642 --> 00:06:41.424]  Of course, CNN is the real fake news here.
[00:06:41.784 --> 00:06:41.964]  Right.
[00:06:42.064 --> 00:06:43.505]  No, no question about it.
[00:07:11.884 --> 00:07:15.189]  So, stirring controversy, civil unrest, before he's even in office.
[00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:32.770]  Yes, 50 billion possibly in potential revenue and job creation on our economy.
[00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:51.565]  But speaking of fake news, Leanne, so the New York Times, probably one of the most egregious aggressors and purveyors of fake news in mainstream media, the editor of the New York Times, her name is Liz Spade, she actually told Politico in this report on Tuesday, in retrospect, I could have held back more, not knowing the context of these tweets.
[00:07:51.585 --> 00:07:56.770]  Now, she's specifically speaking of these egregious, ridiculous tweets that her staff
[00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.832]  Her staff was purporting about Donald Trump.
[00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:01.613]  They were nasty and awful.
[00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:12.519]  Tucker Carlson sat down with her, and just to see her tail-between-her-legs type posturing, she clearly, the egg on their face is unbelievable, but it doesn't change the fact that they did it.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.681]  They're the real hate mongers in this society.
[00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:17.543]  They're the real purveyors of fake news, and yet...
[00:08:18.243 --> 00:08:21.146]  You know, no apology, just, oh, maybe those were a little harsh.
[00:08:21.246 --> 00:08:23.849]  Yeah, so totally spineless, walking it back.
[00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:26.833]  First, when she's pressed on it, she says, yes, they shouldn't have done that.
[00:08:26.853 --> 00:08:27.693]  That was totally biased.
[00:08:27.713 --> 00:08:29.736]  And then her reporters are like, why don't you stick up for us?
[00:08:29.756 --> 00:08:31.498]  And then she's like, well, maybe I shouldn't have done that.
[00:08:31.918 --> 00:08:33.340]  I mean, just completely spineless.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.221]  Back and forth, you know, stand up for what you believe in, for what you value.
[00:08:37.301 --> 00:08:44.483]  And of course, you know, I guess that's what they're doing by trying to create civil unrest in this country by saying, you know, Donald Trump is a Putin suit.
[00:08:44.943 --> 00:08:52.525]  But here Trump is actually showing that he is ready to to get right down to business before he even takes office.
[00:08:52.545 --> 00:08:55.666]  He's making these decisions six weeks before he even gets in.
[00:08:56.346 --> 00:09:01.208]  He tweeted out today about the fact that they are the government is building a new
[00:09:02.128 --> 00:09:02.888]  Air Force One.
[00:09:02.928 --> 00:09:04.889]  And he says the price is ridiculous.
[00:09:05.249 --> 00:09:06.370]  Cancel the order.
[00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:07.691]  Costs are out of control.
[00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:09.771]  More than $4 billion.
[00:09:10.232 --> 00:09:11.212]  So this is Boeing.
[00:09:11.252 --> 00:09:13.553]  They've been contracted by the government to build these planes.
[00:09:13.573 --> 00:09:14.854]  It's going to go into service around 2024.
[00:09:15.734 --> 00:09:22.237]  So Trump himself won't even fly in this plane unless, of course, they get it built on a faster schedule and he gets reelected.
[00:09:22.797 --> 00:09:23.057]  I don't
[00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:39.746]  I don't know.
[00:09:58.726 --> 00:10:01.667]  Meanwhile, they are kneecapping the middle class.
[00:10:02.007 --> 00:10:04.228]  So where is all that tax money going to come from?
[00:10:05.248 --> 00:10:16.492]  So it's really interesting to see on the one hand, we've got the current administration going out, leaving a midnight surprise, midnight regulations to total $44 billion tax dollars.
[00:10:17.013 --> 00:10:24.035]  This is the Obama administration putting forth 25 of these so-called midnight regulations, going to cost the economy $44.1 billion.
[00:10:26.676 --> 00:10:29.260]  And of course, this is maybe an overshot.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.123]  It could be more than eight times of that.
[00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:33.386]  So this is just... Thank you, Obama!
[00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:41.678]  And the GOP, they say when they get in, they are eyeing an overhaul of the federal workforce, reducing the number of workers, and actually...
[00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:44.662]  Making it easier to fire people who suck.
[00:10:44.862 --> 00:10:45.763]  Right.
[00:10:46.303 --> 00:10:47.364]  Revolutionary concept.
[00:10:47.424 --> 00:10:49.486]  Fire people that are inept and don't do their job.
[00:10:49.526 --> 00:10:51.028]  So Washington D.C.
[00:10:51.088 --> 00:10:56.734]  and the surrounding area, specifically in Maryland and Northern Virginia, one of the wealthiest areas in the country.
[00:10:56.774 --> 00:10:59.596]  And the reason for that is all of these mass government jobs.
[00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:00.978]  They pay these crazy salaries.
[00:11:01.778 --> 00:11:04.040]  It's basically La La Land, and I love it.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.201]  Trump says, get off my plane, Boeing, number one.
[00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:08.042]  He's already started trimming the fat.
[00:11:08.062 --> 00:11:10.303]  We actually have one of our co-workers here.
[00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:16.727]  Her father works for Boeing, and he was talking about the massive waste and spending of his company, and he works there, if you can believe that.
[00:11:16.787 --> 00:11:19.689]  The federal workforce under Trump, he's going to streamline it.
[00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:25.212]  He's putting people in positions of power, like Dr. Ben Carson, who's going to head up the HUD agency.
[00:11:25.712 --> 00:11:29.695]  One of the only people that's actually lived in government housing to ever head up HUD.
[00:11:30.035 --> 00:11:31.556]  What a revolutionary thought right there.
[00:11:31.576 --> 00:11:32.997]  And you talked about it, you hit it on the head.
[00:11:33.397 --> 00:11:36.579]  So Obama, he hasn't ruined our country enough.
[00:11:36.599 --> 00:11:39.581]  44 billion, eight times the projection.
[00:11:39.901 --> 00:11:42.483]  Originally it was supposed to be a much lower number, but you know what?
[00:11:42.503 --> 00:11:44.084]  He just, he has to keep spending.
[00:11:44.104 --> 00:11:45.385]  Well, it's not his money.
[00:11:45.445 --> 00:11:45.705]  It's like,
[00:11:46.265 --> 00:11:47.566]  It's Monopoly money!
[00:12:02.132 --> 00:12:02.772]  It's madness!
[00:12:02.812 --> 00:12:09.914]  Specifically, these regulatory agencies that he's created, they've expanded exponentially under his rule, if you will.
[00:12:10.094 --> 00:12:15.835]  And largely, we're talking about the EPA, you know, levying these crazy regulations against companies.
[00:12:15.855 --> 00:12:16.716]  That's a bulk of this.
[00:12:17.376 --> 00:12:26.558]  But really ridiculous regulatory costs to push King Obama's final agenda and the last 50-plus days of office.
[00:12:27.398 --> 00:12:41.374]  And then of course on the other side of the world we've got Angela Merkel and her big fourth term coming up and people are absolutely, just as we are exhausted with what's going on over here, she is now flip-flopping because her country is exhausted with her.
[00:12:42.295 --> 00:12:42.375]  Yeah.
[00:13:13.136 --> 00:13:14.437]  Because she's promising a tougher stance.
[00:13:14.457 --> 00:13:14.877]  Wait, what?
[00:13:15.037 --> 00:13:15.537]  Exactly!
[00:13:15.858 --> 00:13:18.980]  She's promising a tougher stance on immigration, if you can believe this.
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.383]  After a crazy record she's pushed for Germany.
[00:13:22.403 --> 00:13:35.012]  You know, she's speaking to the CDU, the Christian Democratic Union, and she was saying that, look, we need to ban these veils because we have a parallel society happening in Germany.
[00:13:35.032 --> 00:13:39.776]  Well, lady, you created the parallel society that's happening in your country.
[00:13:40.316 --> 00:13:40.736]  You might.
[00:13:40.816 --> 00:13:45.939]  It might be a little too late to actually go back and backpedal here just a little bit.
[00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:49.401]  But it's amazing that she sees the writing on the wall for her.
[00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:51.483]  She sees that she's in utter crisis mode.
[00:13:51.503 --> 00:13:52.203]  She's about to lose.
[00:13:52.443 --> 00:13:55.685]  The Bundestag and the Bundesrat are already starting to work against her in those policies.
[00:13:56.005 --> 00:13:56.746]  And this is her last.
[00:13:56.886 --> 00:13:58.647]  She saw what happened to Matteo Renzi.
[00:13:59.067 --> 00:13:59.888]  It's coming, lady.
[00:13:59.908 --> 00:14:00.748]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:14:00.768 --> 00:14:02.049]  Go ahead and try to ban those veils.
[00:14:02.089 --> 00:14:04.070]  But I mean, my hope is that... It's a little too late for the flip.
[00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.091]  Exactly.
[00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:05.711]  You're done.
[00:14:06.031 --> 00:14:08.593]  Thank you for destroying the country and see you later.
[00:14:08.613 --> 00:14:20.702]  And then, you know, like you mentioned, some of the laws that they're putting forth and just making people fearful to speak out against these policies that are harming their country.
[00:14:20.762 --> 00:14:31.370]  For instance, German state media, they are refusing to actually run the story of the migrant murder where the girl was raped and murdered and tossed into a ravine.
[00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:37.633]  They're not even talking about that because they say it's too regional of a story, even though it's made worldwide headlines.
[00:14:37.913 --> 00:14:39.654]  So they don't even want to cover this story.
[00:14:40.115 --> 00:14:49.880]  And of course, you mentioned earlier about Facebook banning a German woman for posting a picture of this migrant rapist and they're labeling it as hate speech.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:59.225]  Meanwhile, this is the exact same picture that the news put out to show, you know, this is the perpetrator here, but Facebook banned this woman and they're calling it hate speech.
[00:14:59.685 --> 00:15:10.271]  Well, the cologne rapes that happened during their holiday time, they, two women that were interviewed, they were both victims, a mother and daughter, they were both gang raped repeatedly and sexually assaulted by migrants and mass migrants.
[00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:13.833]  They never caught a single perpetrator in those crimes.
[00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:19.076]  And it's because of cases like this, you know, this 19-year-old German medical student, you know, one of German,
[00:15:19.776 --> 00:15:24.439]  A star, and I hate to put it this way, because Hillary Clinton, she started it, frankly, Leigh-Anne, so I'm just going to do it.
[00:15:24.459 --> 00:15:26.861]  A five-star citizen, if you will.
[00:15:26.941 --> 00:15:29.643]  Somebody that you would want, an upstanding member of the community.
[00:15:29.663 --> 00:15:31.324]  Her father was actually in the Parliament.
[00:15:31.664 --> 00:15:39.509]  She's raped and murdered, and oh, we can't even discuss it because of Islamophobia, because it was a refugee that raped and murdered her.
[00:15:39.609 --> 00:15:41.010]  You know, that's how far they've come.
[00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:42.171]  This is their opportunity.
[00:15:42.271 --> 00:15:43.632]  And by the way, don't send flowers.
[00:15:44.092 --> 00:15:46.173]  Donate to organizations.
[00:15:46.193 --> 00:15:46.794]  Refugee causes.
[00:15:46.974 --> 00:15:50.157]  Well, further this migrant cause, it's madness.
[00:15:50.177 --> 00:15:50.877]  Utter madness.
[00:15:51.297 --> 00:15:53.819]  And then further madness with this migrant crisis.
[00:15:53.919 --> 00:16:00.725]  So in Sweden, the authorities have actually now charged five teenagers from Afghanistan with aggravated rape.
[00:16:00.785 --> 00:16:05.649]  They allegedly dragged another Afghan boy into a forest, threatened him with a knife and raped him.
[00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:07.490]  This assault took place in October.
[00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:09.792]  They say it happened more than an hour.
[00:16:09.892 --> 00:16:12.314]  So these teenage boys were 16, 17 years old.
[00:16:12.374 --> 00:16:14.896]  The boy that they allegedly assaulted is under 15.
[00:16:16.477 --> 00:16:19.358]  And I mean, this is absolute madness.
[00:16:19.398 --> 00:16:22.879]  So obviously we know rape is used as an intimidation tactic.
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:32.783]  And of course, in certain cultures, just like our military was told to look, look away at the fact that young boys are being raped because that's their culture.
[00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:34.183]  Exactly.
[00:16:34.203 --> 00:16:43.146]  And in this specific case, the worst part about it, the indictment that followed it, they could not even, the potential is that they won't face expulsion from society, even though they've committed the rapes.
[00:16:43.686 --> 00:16:51.148]  And we've seen this time and again, both in Germany and in France, specifically where rapes are created, or rapes are perpetrated against victims.
[00:16:51.448 --> 00:16:53.029]  They don't even expel the migrant.
[00:16:53.169 --> 00:16:56.350]  It's normally swept under the rug, which is exactly what my prediction will be here.
[00:16:59.219 --> 00:17:09.846]  And to just bring it back here to our shores, now we've got an amnesty group actually fighting to hide the California gang database from Donald Trump.
[00:17:10.566 --> 00:17:14.309]  So, I mean, this is social justice warrior madness.
[00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.130]  This is immigration advocacy groups.
[00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:21.496]  They're asking California Attorney, the Attorney General there, to block federal access to the database.
[00:17:21.596 --> 00:17:23.958]  It contains names of gang members in the state.
[00:17:24.379 --> 00:17:36.732]  The goal is to block access before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in, thereby preventing his administration from seeing the names of individuals who could find themselves on the deportation shortlist.
[00:17:37.193 --> 00:17:37.433]  What?! !
[00:17:38.414 --> 00:17:39.915]  Get the hell out of the country!
[00:17:39.955 --> 00:17:40.676]  That's what we're talking about.
[00:17:40.696 --> 00:17:42.857]  It's not about rounding up and deporting everyone.
[00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:48.081]  It's specifically gang members, people here that are committing violent acts, raping, murdering.
[00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:49.022]  Protect the criminals, Leigh-Anne.
[00:17:49.142 --> 00:17:49.942]  That's what this is about.
[00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:56.027]  That attorney general in California, he apparently doesn't know the law, especially the federal law when it comes to immigration policies.
[00:17:56.147 --> 00:18:06.995]  And the president needs to immediately yank any sort of federal monies going into California if in fact that takes effect, which I'm assuming that it will based on all of the crazy news we know that comes out of California, frankly.
[00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:10.356]  The fact that they want to protect the criminal, offer sanctuary cities.
[00:18:10.636 --> 00:18:14.457]  We're talking about violent murderers in these specific cases here.
[00:18:14.737 --> 00:18:16.938]  And that's exactly who Donald Trump has tried.
[00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:27.140]  You know, albeit the mainstream media has tried to take his words out of, spin him out of control, but he's tried to express over and over again, this is what he wants to focus on is these violent gangs, these violent criminals.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.561]  We don't want this in our country.
[00:18:29.321 --> 00:18:29.981]  And you know what?
[00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:35.043]  That's why I was kind of laughing when California was threatening to secede when Donald Trump got elected.
[00:18:35.123 --> 00:18:36.204]  Like, see you later.
[00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:39.545]  Frankly, you guys, I know we have a huge audience out there in California.
[00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:40.545]  We love you guys.
[00:18:40.645 --> 00:18:41.906]  We know it's not everyone out there.
[00:18:42.266 --> 00:18:42.446]  All right.
[00:18:42.466 --> 00:18:43.446]  Well, thank you so much, Margaret.
[00:18:43.486 --> 00:18:43.907]  And thank you.
[00:18:43.927 --> 00:18:47.408]  Stick around because we've got a lot more nightly news coming right up after this.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.203]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:19:46.884 --> 00:19:48.465]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:19:48.865 --> 00:19:53.848]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:59.652]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:20:00.052 --> 00:20:06.636]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:20:07.277 --> 00:20:08.438]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:11.219]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:14.501]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:18.563]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:20:18.743 --> 00:20:21.304]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:20:21.364 --> 00:20:33.711]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:39.053]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:20:39.153 --> 00:20:40.494]  It's bound.
[00:20:40.554 --> 00:20:41.774]  It's not absorbable.
[00:20:42.194 --> 00:20:46.756]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:20:46.976 --> 00:20:51.878]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:20:52.238 --> 00:20:55.960]  It's such a game changer if you'll just research iodine for yourself.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.681]  It's a fact that the federal government in the Midwest back in the 20s
[00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:08.206]  Mandated a grungier form of iodine to the salt because people had low IQs, they had huge goiters, major problems directly connected to it.
[00:21:08.386 --> 00:21:12.048]  There are some studies that show a 15 point increase, others show even higher.
[00:21:12.208 --> 00:21:25.656]  But it really is crazy to realize that this is something that is so deficient in our food chain, so deficient in our played out fields where different crops are being grown, but the federal government isn't educating people and telling them about it.
[00:21:25.856 --> 00:21:37.399]  That's why for a limited time, I want to encourage everyone to go to Infowarslife.com and get 20% off on the best nascent iodine out there from our research, Truly Pure Survival Shield X2.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.260]  Again, that's Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.461]  Thank you for joining us in this brief news update.
[00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:48.743]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:21:48.823 --> 00:21:49.983]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:52.724]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:21:52.884 --> 00:21:53.104]  Of course!
[00:22:15.742 --> 00:22:19.404]  You've got to have vitamin C, you've got to have iodine to live, you've got to have water to live.
[00:22:19.744 --> 00:22:30.249]  Iodine is key, you must have it, but consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com, or call toll free, we can answer your questions, 888-253-3139.
[00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:32.630]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:45.387]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:22:46.048 --> 00:22:47.971]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:22:48.311 --> 00:22:52.517]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:22:52.657 --> 00:22:56.002]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:22:56.082 --> 00:22:57.644]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:23:03.928 --> 00:23:09.110]  It's safe to say we have all heard of someone who's in desperate need of a life-saving organ transplant.
[00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:14.852]  But many people spend months, if not years, on waiting lists hoping that a compatible donor will come along.
[00:23:15.372 --> 00:23:19.554]  Now there's, you know, it's no secret there's a shortage of these desperately needed organs.
[00:23:20.054 --> 00:23:25.276]  But in some countries, for the right price, you can purchase these organs on the black market.
[00:23:25.456 --> 00:23:28.777]  There's kind of a wink that you won't ask where these organs have come from.
[00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:30.858]  Human traffickers are notorious
[00:23:31.238 --> 00:23:31.859]  We're good to go.
[00:23:47.273 --> 00:23:48.154]  But where do they come from?
[00:23:48.454 --> 00:23:51.176]  Where do they get this endless supply of organs on demand?
[00:23:51.216 --> 00:23:59.682]  Now experts say that the government has secretly turned to the prison population as its source to fill this growing demand.
[00:24:00.002 --> 00:24:02.063]  These are so-called prisoners of conscience.
[00:24:02.404 --> 00:24:11.190]  So it sounds totally unbelievable, too unbelievable to be true, but dozens of highly respected investigators, scholars, and government officials around the world
[00:24:15.372 --> 00:24:23.215]  My guest today is Mitchell Nicholas Gerber.
[00:24:23.255 --> 00:24:24.075]  He is an activist.
[00:24:24.095 --> 00:24:33.879]  He's dedicated his life to help expose and stop this most brutal persecution, human rights atrocity that is happening here in China.
[00:24:34.399 --> 00:24:40.622]  The state mandated and state endorsed forced live organ harvesting of the Falun Gong
[00:24:41.082 --> 00:24:53.294]  I mean, this is just, you know, Mitchell, you've been trying to get in contact with me for quite some time, and a lot of people when they hear this, it just sounds totally unbelievable, but you've really dedicated your life to exposing this.
[00:24:53.334 --> 00:24:58.079]  You've got so much facts to back this up, and it's really kind of coming out there in the public eye.
[00:24:58.119 --> 00:24:59.600]  Thank you so much for being with us.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:05.046]  So, explain to us a little bit, you know, what is the Falun Gong movement, and what has happened with them?
[00:25:06.001 --> 00:25:07.622]  Well, first of all, Leanne, thank you so much.
[00:25:07.683 --> 00:25:29.822]  I take my hat off to InfoWars, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson for allowing me to expose even more about this new form of genocide occurring against such a spiritual, innocent group of people who practice these four or five exercises, slow-moving, easy to work with and free exercises that really do tremendous health and well-being and improvement for the body.
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.304]  Falun Gong became the largest spiritual movement in all of communist China.
[00:25:34.404 --> 00:25:36.947]  We won out of every 12 national citizens.
[00:25:37.788 --> 00:25:45.255]  By 1998, 100 million were practicing, estimates of the Chinese government, were practicing in all walks of life.
[00:25:45.355 --> 00:25:51.822]  Even the families of the highest politburo members were practicing, military generals, lawyers, politicians from the highest to the lowest classes.
[00:25:52.663 --> 00:25:59.625]  And the philosophy of Falun Gong is just deeply rooted in three universal principles, truthfulness, compassion and tolerance.
[00:26:00.306 --> 00:26:12.930]  This became the opiate of the Chinese people and by 1998 gained worldwide respect and in China the respect it deserved because of its incredible health benefits.
[00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:19.952]  But unfortunately by 1999 the then military dictator Jiang Zemin who is now coined the evil
[00:26:20.712 --> 00:26:36.280]  Wow, and of course, you know, we see the Chinese Communist Party, I mean, total overreach there.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.582]  Any spiritual faith that goes against the state, that the state cannot control.
[00:26:41.442 --> 00:26:46.785]  There was a recent article about them actually trying to control reincarnation of the Dalai Lama.
[00:26:47.185 --> 00:26:49.526]  So that the Dalai Lama couldn't be born outside.
[00:26:49.546 --> 00:26:56.850]  Only the Chinese Communist Party could decide who the new Dalai Lama could be because they don't want anyone's thought to be outside of the state.
[00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:58.771]  Just total control.
[00:26:58.811 --> 00:26:59.871]  They're very dangerous.
[00:26:59.931 --> 00:27:02.993]  So talk to people about this forced organ harvesting.
[00:27:03.533 --> 00:27:04.394]  What is it all about?
[00:27:04.494 --> 00:27:10.877]  And you have coined this or it's being coined as a new kind of evil that has not existed on this planet before.
[00:27:11.744 --> 00:27:12.224]  Absolutely.
[00:27:12.264 --> 00:27:19.869]  Well, first of all, just to speak on a comment from Jiang Zemin, who was the military dictator.
[00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:30.055]  You know, a lot of people talk about Mao Zedong being the most evil in China, but it's actually Jiang Zemin, the former military dictator, who has now been sued in China.
[00:27:30.756 --> 00:27:37.200]  A very serious movement that is going on also, called Quit the Communist Party, is also commencing in China.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.242]  But basically, Jiang Zemin ordered
[00:27:41.222 --> 00:27:42.243]  We're good to go.
[00:28:03.551 --> 00:28:04.232]  We're good.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.642]  Confirmed that the allegations of forced organ harvesting were commencing between 2001 and 2006.
[00:28:25.682 --> 00:28:28.743]  Their figures at that time were about 60,000.
[00:28:29.144 --> 00:28:39.828]  They've just released another 600 page report when they visited the Congress in the United States where the House of Representatives unanimously
[00:28:42.669 --> 00:29:06.290]  uh... uh... voted to stop and urge the communist regime to stop the organ harvesting in the six hundred page report they have uh... confirmed that there are at least hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners that have been killed every year as Alex pointed out last night on his video of Falun Gong just sent to death camps their organs cut out of their bodies while alive the organs then sold
[00:29:07.211 --> 00:29:15.154]  And the bodies then burned in the crematories and the ovens and then sold off to the body exhibitions that you and Margaret were talking about last night on your video about Communist China.
[00:29:16.014 --> 00:29:23.237]  And this is a new form of evil that hasn't occurred on such a scale, scope and magnitude in history before in our lifetimes.
[00:29:23.857 --> 00:29:33.581]  And from an admission of a former wife by a military surgeon who removed corneas from the living bodies of 2,000 Falun Gong practitioners, she said,
[00:29:34.341 --> 00:29:35.722]  You don't understand my agony.
[00:29:36.063 --> 00:29:38.065]  Those Falun Gong practitioners were alive.
[00:29:38.345 --> 00:29:41.288]  It might be easier for me if they were dead, but they were alive.
[00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:54.360]  The testimony from David Mattis was that a lot of people have heard about organ harvesting around the world, but he quoted that China is not the only country with organ transplant abuse.
[00:29:54.861 --> 00:29:57.983]  But what's different is that China is institutionalized
[00:29:58.624 --> 00:30:01.268]  It's a state run and it's poorly directed.
[00:30:01.368 --> 00:30:06.514]  It's on a few just criminals in a back alley trying to make a fast buck.
[00:30:07.175 --> 00:30:15.426]  So when I came to understand about this, I really gave and devoted my 60s, almost 50 years of my life with so many different people around the world.
[00:30:16.167 --> 00:30:17.048]  Thank you very much.
[00:30:33.621 --> 00:30:51.932]  Yeah, well I know the more we get this out the more people are going to be interested in the story and now obviously there's a documentary just released, a movie's coming out as well and one of the key players in the movie is this tech worker who's there to China and he's working on being able to build China's internet censorship.
[00:30:51.992 --> 00:30:58.776]  So we're seeing how they've, you know, for at least more than a decade have really propped themselves up to not be exposed.
[00:30:58.876 --> 00:30:59.697]  Obviously we know the
[00:31:00.137 --> 00:31:04.579]  Real fake news media would never talk about anything like this because they don't want to upset China.
[00:31:04.639 --> 00:31:07.740]  We see how upset they got over Trump's Taiwan phone call.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:18.264]  But so there is evidence of this as the bodies exhibit has had to put signs outside of the exhibit alerting people to where these bodies actually came from.
[00:31:18.844 --> 00:31:25.569]  In 2014, the Chinese government announced that they were going to no longer harvest organs from prisoners who had been executed.
[00:31:26.349 --> 00:31:33.174]  But according to Doctors Against Force Organ Harvesting, they say the data shows organ donations in China have actually increased.
[00:31:33.674 --> 00:31:35.695]  So how is that even happening?
[00:31:35.776 --> 00:31:37.076]  How do they have organs on demand?
[00:31:37.136 --> 00:31:38.297]  It's just totally outrageous.
[00:31:38.838 --> 00:31:40.559]  So we only have about a minute left.
[00:31:40.659 --> 00:31:48.464]  Mitchell, could you please tell people briefly what can they do to help and where can they go and any kind of final words of encouragement?
[00:31:49.125 --> 00:32:09.423]  Yes, if I could just grab through the screen to just grab their attention and allow them to know that they can go to StopOrganHarvesting.org and OrganPillaging.org, read David Kilgore and David Mattis' report online called Bloody Harvest, also Ethan Gutman's report in Slaughter.
[00:32:09.983 --> 00:32:17.508]  This is going on, it's undeniable, and to fail to expose evil and to fail to support good is unacceptable.
[00:32:17.988 --> 00:32:30.757]  So I thank you, Leanne, and I thank Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones and the whole InfoWars team for allowing me to come on and share more about stopping this brutality, and that Falun Gong is a good practice and that shouldn't be persecuted.
[00:32:30.817 --> 00:32:37.541]  But if you just go to StopOrganHarvesting.org or EndOrganPillaging.org, everything is there, precise
[00:32:38.302 --> 00:32:38.662]  Absolutely.
[00:33:02.523 --> 00:33:07.988]  This is the answer for your children to totally absorb the multivitamins, the minerals, the amino acids, everything at once.
[00:33:08.528 --> 00:33:09.049]  Unveiled!
[00:33:09.449 --> 00:33:12.492]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formula.
[00:33:13.173 --> 00:33:13.633]  30 servings.
[00:33:13.833 --> 00:33:16.436]  Fruit punch flavor dietary supplement.
[00:33:16.756 --> 00:33:17.797]  It is simply amazing.
[00:33:17.877 --> 00:33:18.818]  Infowarslife.com
[00:33:19.198 --> 00:33:23.600]  There's a million different products like this out there, but they're, you know, they're good in different ways.
[00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:37.227]  But this takes all of the vitamins, all of the essential amino acids, all of the essential compounds and minerals that you need, puts it into something that's great tasting as opposed to like clumpy, gross stuff.
[00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.808]  And you can put it in your drink every morning.
[00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:40.029]  I put it in my protein shake.
[00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:46.133]  It is the platinum standard, in my view, of multivitamins in terms of an advanced multi-drink vitamin.
[00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:49.175]  The cleanest, the purest, new stuff had to be invented.
[00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:51.456]  That's why it took this long to even bring us something that's good.
[00:33:52.057 --> 00:33:58.201]  Some companies are gonna take a small amount of vitamins and make it, you know, so there's so much filler, it looks like there's a lot.
[00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.783]  This is ultra-concentrated, we're not playing games here.
[00:34:01.143 --> 00:34:03.004]  Okay, this... Well, that's my philosophy, that's your philosophy.
[00:34:03.024 --> 00:34:05.346]  Yeah, this... I wanna... But again, there's some great stuff out there.
[00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:05.726]  Yeah.
[00:34:05.946 --> 00:34:07.447]  And there's other, you know... No, of course.
[00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:10.349]  There's other powders I promote at InfoWarsHealth.com that are excellent.
[00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.909]  I mean, there's some good stuff out there.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.152]  This is just the very best we can bring you, and when you buy it, you support InfoWars, you support the reporters, you support yourself.
[00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:39.919]  Tell folks about some of these other things that are in this, and why this is just this total, complete package for your body, because, again, we didn't put the synthetic amino acids, we didn't put the synthetic vitamins, we put the plant-based, high-quality, clean, natural ingredients into this.
[00:34:40.447 --> 00:34:41.027]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:41.087 --> 00:34:44.228]  So you've got your standard vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, the list goes on.
[00:34:44.328 --> 00:34:45.568]  A huge amount of vitamin C, by the way.
[00:34:45.588 --> 00:34:46.168]  Tell folks about that.
[00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:49.088]  Yeah, a thousand plus percent of your daily value, which is what you need.
[00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.589]  Because the, you know, FDA guidelines, we all know about those.
[00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:55.670]  Zinc, magnesium, selenium, L-glutamine.
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.510]  Each one of these you could go on for about 10 minutes about the benefits of these things.
[00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.131]  Alpha lipoic acid, folic acid, calcium, and the list goes on.
[00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:04.691]  34 other ones you can check out.
[00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.731]  Go to importslife.com, the label's up there.
[00:35:07.252 --> 00:35:09.552]  You've got the entire ingredients list that you can
[00:35:09.952 --> 00:35:19.939]  Neurotically examined for yourself and just by the way look on the other side too because we're showing people the minerals and things let's look at the vitamins right there old Scott in there I mean it's amazing.
[00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:20.440]  Top left.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.862]  Again if you're radio listeners, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.285]  Vitamin A has 4,333% from beta carotene and what's the other source?
[00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.707]  I just know that's all the best sources.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:32.806]  Retinol.
[00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:37.328]  So you've also got your vitamin D at a thousand IU, which is a large dose, actually.
[00:35:37.649 --> 00:35:38.049]  And you know what?
[00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:40.290]  Some people could say, well, isn't this competing with the other products?
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.110]  Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:48.154]  We could be like some people and just take all the stuff that we sell also at Infowarslife.com and not put any of it, but then it wouldn't be a balanced formula and we're not going to do that.
[00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:53.997]  And it might actually hurt us in the long run to put all the best stuff in here, but that's just the way we got to do it because we can't start thinking like that.
[00:35:54.517 --> 00:35:55.358]  So get them today!

[00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.983]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:36:02.363 --> 00:36:08.288]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.649]  When I got on air 20 years ago,
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:25.219]  I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights, to focusing on fighting the Globalist.
[00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:29.582]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds, and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:36:33.604 --> 00:36:40.690]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:36:41.031 --> 00:36:46.696]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:36:46.896 --> 00:36:53.022]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:36:53.322 --> 00:36:57.065]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:37:03.547 --> 00:37:10.191]  Rob Dewey with Infowars.com and I want to talk about the fever dream that is the Jill Stein-induced recount going on in three states right now.
[00:37:10.231 --> 00:37:13.473]  That's Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.
[00:37:13.953 --> 00:37:15.334]  But first I want to say this to Jill.
[00:37:16.505 --> 00:37:20.227]  I know you went out there and said, oh, we got to worry about Hillary Clinton.
[00:37:20.247 --> 00:37:25.409]  She's going to cause World War III because you thought and you believed those fake polls out there that said she was going to win.
[00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:30.812]  So you wanted to set yourself up as the counterpuncher to who you thought was going to be president.
[00:37:31.072 --> 00:37:32.273]  She led the way in Libya.
[00:37:32.693 --> 00:37:40.637]  She's trying to start an air war with Russia over Syria, which means if Hillary gets elected, we're kind of going to war with Russia, folks.
[00:37:40.897 --> 00:37:42.618]  And then when Donald Trump became president,
[00:37:43.493 --> 00:37:45.877]  You started looking and going, how can I capitalize off this?
[00:37:46.358 --> 00:37:47.159]  We all know what you're doing.
[00:37:47.199 --> 00:37:50.664]  We all know this is for money, and it's backfiring in your face big time.
[00:37:51.165 --> 00:37:54.450]  In fact, let's go right now to Wisconsin and look at what's going on there.
[00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:55.933]  They're on day five of their recount.
[00:37:56.153 --> 00:37:57.815]  Here at InfoWars.com, we've got the article.
[00:37:58.316 --> 00:37:58.617]  Update!
[00:37:58.957 --> 00:38:06.919]  Trump up by 70,000 votes in Wisconsin recount so far, proving his point that he would gain votes in a recount and thus win the popular vote.
[00:38:07.239 --> 00:38:19.421]  And if you look at how the spreadsheet is set up, you've got the column set up of the original election results, where Trump leads by 22,000, then you've got where the recounts are happening in the middle, and then next to that is the difference in votes.
[00:38:19.861 --> 00:38:24.882]  And right now I want to focus on the recount section, where it has Donald Trump winning by
[00:38:26.362 --> 00:38:27.083]  69,899 votes.
[00:38:27.103 --> 00:38:29.884]  That's in the precincts that have reported so far.
[00:38:30.704 --> 00:38:40.388]  And if we go to Heavy.com, who's also been reporting on this, you can see that over the five days, Trump has netted 84 votes, while Clinton has only netted 58 votes.
[00:38:41.068 --> 00:38:44.029]  So he's already building on his 22,000 lead.
[00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:49.571]  So when we have him winning at 70,000 votes, that just means the precincts that have been counted thus far.
[00:38:50.717 --> 00:38:54.880]  Now let's move to Michigan, where Trump only won by a little over 10,000 votes.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:01.064]  And so this was the Democrats' best chance to, I guess, steal an election from him if they were going to do that in a recount.
[00:39:01.804 --> 00:39:02.945]  But I got some bad news.
[00:39:02.985 --> 00:39:06.007]  In fact, half of Detroit votes may be ineligible for recount.
[00:39:06.676 --> 00:39:08.217]  Wow, that's going to be a shame.
[00:39:09.158 --> 00:39:16.863]  One-third of precincts in Wayne County could be disqualified from an unprecedented statewide recount of presidential election results because of problems with the ballots.
[00:39:17.403 --> 00:39:20.585]  And here's what Ingham County Clerk Barb Byram had to say about the issue.
[00:39:20.882 --> 00:39:24.003]  There's a checklist on whether or not a precinct can be unrecountable.
[00:39:24.043 --> 00:39:32.267]  If there's a large tear in the ballot container that would allow ballots to be removed or ballots to be put in, that potentially could deem a precinct unrecountable.
[00:39:32.607 --> 00:39:45.093]  If the seal on the ballot container bag doesn't match the seal number written in the poll book, that could potentially be a cause for an unrecountable precinct as well.
[00:39:45.253 --> 00:39:52.698]  First, they have to make sure that the seal numbers match the seal numbers recorded in the poll books.
[00:39:53.358 --> 00:39:56.020]  And then they will inspect the ballot containers.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.443]  They will also then take out the ballots and maybe any unused ballots still in the rack.
[00:40:01.823 --> 00:40:08.628]  And they will count the ballots and make sure the number of ballots in the ballot container equals the number of ballots recorded in the poll book.
[00:40:09.264 --> 00:40:10.465]  So there's two things going on here.
[00:40:10.806 --> 00:40:17.252]  One is the vote totals in the ballot box have to reconcile with what's written in the poll book, and also the seal numbers have to be the same.
[00:40:17.693 --> 00:40:24.499]  In Michigan's largest county, 610 of the 1680 precincts didn't have reconciled vote totals.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:25.861]  That makes them invalid.
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:34.146]  And in Democrat-heavy Detroit, 392 of the 662 precincts did not have matching seal numbers.
[00:40:34.566 --> 00:40:38.329]  This is going to throw a bunch of vote totals out for Hillary Clinton in this recount.
[00:40:38.529 --> 00:40:39.230]  But we're not done.
[00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:44.214]  In Genesee County, 13 of 222 precincts did not have balancing numbers.
[00:40:44.654 --> 00:40:46.756]  And that's in mainly Democrat-heavy Flint.
[00:40:47.458 --> 00:40:51.379]  And so far in Ingram County, 6 of the 30 precincts could not be recounted.
[00:40:51.959 --> 00:40:53.379]  In the official results, Trump won by 10,000.
[00:40:54.299 --> 00:40:59.541]  But now with all these votes being thrown out in the recount, I think you're going to see this balloon to maybe up to 50,000 votes for Trump.
[00:40:59.681 --> 00:41:01.121]  A big win this time.
[00:41:01.681 --> 00:41:02.581]  And it's good to see that.
[00:41:02.881 --> 00:41:05.922]  Now let's move on to PA, where we have a BillyPinn.com.
[00:41:06.342 --> 00:41:07.602]  They just did the recount in Philly.
[00:41:07.622 --> 00:41:08.162]  They finished it.
[00:41:08.623 --> 00:41:09.863]  Hillary Clinton got 5 votes.
[00:41:10.796 --> 00:41:11.296]  Five votes.
[00:41:11.676 --> 00:41:12.537]  Trump stayed the same.
[00:41:12.657 --> 00:41:13.737]  Jill Stein stayed the same.
[00:41:14.157 --> 00:41:15.297]  Gary Johnson stayed the same.
[00:41:15.677 --> 00:41:16.958]  She got five votes in Philly.
[00:41:17.178 --> 00:41:20.599]  The only other place she's going to get a lot of votes is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[00:41:20.819 --> 00:41:22.099]  So things are not looking good there.
[00:41:22.399 --> 00:41:26.801]  She looks like she's barely going to cut into that nearly 50,000 vote margin that Donald Trump has in PA.
[00:41:27.714 --> 00:41:29.994]  Now, there's two other states that are involved in the recount fight.
[00:41:30.114 --> 00:41:35.415]  One is Nevada, where Rocky De La Fuente paid for a recount, and they're going to recount 92 precincts.
[00:41:35.595 --> 00:41:37.836]  Right now, Clinton has a lead of 27,000 votes.
[00:41:38.216 --> 00:41:39.396]  It's probably going to stay the same.
[00:41:39.736 --> 00:41:46.898]  And the other is in Florida, where on Monday, at Leon Circuit Court, a lawsuit was filed that asserts that Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump, actually won Florida.
[00:41:47.358 --> 00:41:49.718]  There's no way she's going to get those votes in Florida, folks.
[00:41:49.858 --> 00:41:51.638]  It was a landslide in Florida.
[00:41:52.139 --> 00:41:54.019]  Comparative terms, if you look at past elections.
[00:41:54.739 --> 00:41:59.464]  So in the end, we're going to have the first female major presidential candidate lose the election twice.
[00:41:59.944 --> 00:42:01.446]  And that's not going to look good for anybody.
[00:42:01.746 --> 00:42:09.053]  But thank you, Jill Stein, for proving a point that our elections are kind of hoodwinked, and there is some chicanery going on in some of these precincts, especially up in Michigan.
[00:42:09.574 --> 00:42:12.737]  Now I want to end this final piece of Trump news with the Trump effect.
[00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:17.422]  It was reported today in the Wall Street Journal, SoftBank pledges to invest $50 billion in U.S.
[00:42:17.462 --> 00:42:18.243]  after meeting with Trump.
[00:42:18.683 --> 00:42:19.604]  This is a big deal.
[00:42:19.624 --> 00:42:22.726]  They're going to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 jobs.
[00:42:23.026 --> 00:42:27.489]  The Trump effect is making positive waves throughout the economy, and he's not even president yet.
[00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:30.752]  This is Rob Drew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.
[00:42:36.015 --> 00:42:48.144]  China has a corporate tax, depending on which year it is, it changes 10 to 15 points lower than ours.
[00:42:49.286 --> 00:43:07.074]  And if China has a currency 30 to 40 points below ours, depending on, again, what day of the week it is, but 30 to 40 points lower than ours, and if they have no environmental standards and slave labor wages and 16 to 18 hour workdays with no benefits,
[00:43:08.157 --> 00:43:09.217]  How do we compete with that?
[00:43:09.997 --> 00:43:21.160]  Now, the mainline libertarian think tanks, like the Heritage Foundation and others, that claim they're conservative, claim they're libertarian, they'll tell you, oh, well, free trade just means we're totally wide open and we don't care what you do.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.221]  You can have 100% tariff on us, we've got zero on you.
[00:43:25.861 --> 00:43:32.002]  And then they don't complain when we have our coal power plants shut down, which gives us cheap electricity, and then China builds new ones.
[00:43:32.322 --> 00:43:34.723]  They don't point out that it's totally rigged
[00:43:38.286 --> 00:43:41.209]  At a 90 degree angle.
[00:43:43.371 --> 00:43:43.891]  Against us.
[00:43:45.593 --> 00:43:45.993]  Totally.
[00:43:46.573 --> 00:43:48.615]  If somebody wants to build a coal-fired plant, they can.
[00:43:49.256 --> 00:43:57.083]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[00:43:57.751 --> 00:44:01.633]  We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.
[00:44:01.973 --> 00:44:06.896]  And Coal Resource Director Zhao Youwei doesn't think this will affect China.
[00:44:07.336 --> 00:44:14.619]  He says the shipping distance compared with Indonesia, Australia and other traditional thermal coal exporters is too far.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.721]  So it should not have a direct impact on the Chinese market in the short term.
[00:44:18.862 --> 00:44:25.505]  The historical problem with the coal industry is when we have these pairings back,
[00:44:27.228 --> 00:44:28.729]  There's nothing there to replace it.
[00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:32.211]  Coal's the only industry in this region.
[00:44:32.512 --> 00:44:35.894]  It's not the regulation so much as it is the execution of it.
[00:44:36.895 --> 00:44:43.980]  When you come in and you tell this many people that your industry is gone, we have to have someplace to go.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:51.184]  Coal is a leading source of carbon dioxide emissions, and even though Minnesota's already cut carbon emissions by 20 percent,
[00:44:52.345 --> 00:44:58.126]  New federal pollution standards require the state to cut more, 40% by 2030.
[00:44:58.887 --> 00:45:03.528]  Minnesota is being punished because we took this action without the federal government telling us.
[00:45:04.048 --> 00:45:12.750]  So whatever that percentage is, reasonable people can disagree about it, but why would we support a policy that punishes the state of Minnesota for acting on our own?
[00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:18.914]  Richard Nixon was the progenitor of the EPA, and the basic rules were established then.
[00:45:19.034 --> 00:45:22.397]  And those basic rules are, it's an administrative agency.
[00:45:22.557 --> 00:45:23.878]  It's not in the executive branch.
[00:45:23.938 --> 00:45:25.179]  It's not in the legislative branch.
[00:45:25.239 --> 00:45:26.399]  It's not in the judicial branch.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.602]  And the president gets to appoint his people to it.
[00:45:30.022 --> 00:45:36.286]  And they get to write the regulations that regulate the behavior of corporations and private individuals.
[00:45:36.707 --> 00:45:41.350]  And those regulations stand unless disturbed by the courts or by both houses of Congress.
[00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:42.651]  And it's done by design.
[00:45:42.711 --> 00:45:47.033]  If Trump lowers our corporate tax to the global average, he's only made us
[00:46:05.054 --> 00:46:08.136]  The money that's outside of this country, nobody knows how much.
[00:46:08.156 --> 00:46:10.098]  They think it's 2.5 trillion dollars.
[00:46:10.118 --> 00:46:12.520]  I think it's probably more than that, but nobody knows.
[00:46:23.488 --> 00:46:28.253]  That money, Aaron, is going to come back into the country, and it's going to stay here, and they're going to invest it here.
[00:46:28.753 --> 00:46:35.820]  And frankly, from now on, when people make, when these companies make money outside of the country, they can bring it back in at a reasonable tax.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.103]  The reason it stays there is the tax is so onerous, as you know.
[00:46:39.143 --> 00:46:40.284]  It's a massive tax.
[00:46:40.444 --> 00:46:45.869]  The media's been telling us how to dress, and what to eat, and what to do, and how to talk for 50, 60 years.
[00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.890]  We've had enough of it!
[00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:55.000]  Part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:46:55.401 --> 00:47:00.388]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[00:47:03.027 --> 00:47:11.173]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.153 --> 00:47:20.959]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption, and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.282 --> 00:47:28.324]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.745 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.

[00:49:08.234 --> 00:49:15.576]  Well, the so-called Barack Obama birth certificate conspiracy theory is not going away anytime soon.
[00:49:15.957 --> 00:49:26.460]  In fact, there is a renewed effort by criminal investigators and law enforcement to expose what they're calling evidence of fraud and forgery.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:29.221]  That is, by the way, that's a federal offense.
[00:49:29.881 --> 00:49:36.224]  And check this out, the evidence does not suggest that Barack Obama was born outside of the United States.
[00:49:36.344 --> 00:49:49.932]  No, there is compelling evidence that suggests the big lie and the whole reason behind the forgery to begin with was to cover up the identity of Barack Obama's real father.
[00:49:50.672 --> 00:49:57.256]  Jill Gilbert is with us now, and he is the writer and director of the groundbreaking documentary, Dreams from My Real Father.
[00:49:57.396 --> 00:50:07.443]  And since the film was released in 2012, a lot of new evidence has surfaced, including some brand new bombshell information that he is going to share with us right now.
[00:50:07.503 --> 00:50:08.924]  Jill Gilbert, thanks for being here.
[00:50:09.324 --> 00:50:17.229]  Let's start from the very beginning, because a lot of people, as soon as they hear this birther controversy, they've been indoctrinated by the mainstream media.
[00:50:17.249 --> 00:50:19.090]  They've been conditioned just to stop.
[00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:20.231]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:20.771]  I don't believe it.
[00:50:20.791 --> 00:50:21.812]  I don't even want to hear about it.
[00:50:22.112 --> 00:50:24.094]  What evidence do we have that it's a fraud?
[00:50:24.474 --> 00:50:25.695]  Okay, so here's where it came from.
[00:50:25.715 --> 00:50:27.296]  Back in 2008, Barack Obama burst on the scene.
[00:50:31.869 --> 00:50:35.312]  You know, that he'd been a mainstream politician his whole life.
[00:50:35.492 --> 00:50:37.994]  And he based his candidacy on his personal story.
[00:50:38.074 --> 00:50:42.537]  His book, Dreams for My Father, he said, my father was a goat herder from Kenya.
[00:50:42.737 --> 00:50:46.119]  I'm uniquely qualified to bring people together with my unique background.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:50.382]  And people started to ask questions about him because they'd never heard of him before.
[00:50:50.422 --> 00:50:52.223]  And they said, well, can we see your college records?
[00:50:52.404 --> 00:50:53.684]  He said, well, no, you can't see those.
[00:50:54.305 --> 00:50:54.825]  Lock and key.
[00:50:54.865 --> 00:50:56.746]  Well, what about your state senate records?
[00:50:56.786 --> 00:50:59.028]  Your record as a state senator in Illinois?
[00:50:59.588 --> 00:51:00.589]  Completely locked away.
[00:51:01.329 --> 00:51:04.491]  What about, you said your father's from Kenya, you grew up in Indonesia.
[00:51:05.012 --> 00:51:08.654]  Could we release your birth documents like every other candidate?
[00:51:08.814 --> 00:51:09.275]  He said, no.
[00:51:10.242 --> 00:51:17.607]  So, people that asked the questions were legitimate questions about who is this guy, and everywhere you looked you saw radical connections.
[00:51:17.667 --> 00:51:20.789]  He was for 20 years in Reverend Jeremiah Wright's church.
[00:51:21.209 --> 00:51:22.269]  Goddamn America.
[00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:24.731]  Anti-white, anti-American worldview.
[00:51:25.652 --> 00:51:28.813]  Michelle Obama certainly didn't have a lot of nice things to say about America.
[00:51:28.854 --> 00:51:30.475]  That's his wife.
[00:51:31.015 --> 00:51:35.498]  His mentor, who he'd been on the Woods Foundation with, and alleged just his neighbor,
[00:51:36.318 --> 00:51:37.339]  I don't think so.
[00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:54.212]  So we just kept asking questions.
[00:51:54.692 --> 00:51:56.474]  You don't seem like this mainstream politician.
[00:51:56.514 --> 00:51:57.975]  You say you're going to cut the deficit in half.
[00:51:57.995 --> 00:51:59.577]  You're going to respect the Constitution.
[00:51:59.997 --> 00:52:03.280]  He said he would support Israel.
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.781]  All this mainstream stuff.
[00:52:05.442 --> 00:52:08.284]  But it didn't match what little we knew of his record.
[00:52:08.344 --> 00:52:11.087]  Meanwhile, he's a complete ghost candidate at the time.
[00:52:11.127 --> 00:52:12.228]  Now he's a ghost president.
[00:52:12.488 --> 00:52:14.369]  We don't know a lot about his past.
[00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:17.913]  And it just raises suspicion when you don't
[00:52:18.633 --> 00:52:20.134]  Supply people with the documents.
[00:52:20.354 --> 00:52:22.994]  So this is not just forged documents.
[00:52:23.014 --> 00:52:26.416]  We're talking about documents that have simply been kept from the public record.
[00:52:26.696 --> 00:52:27.056]  Correct.
[00:52:27.216 --> 00:52:42.261]  And what happened was the mainstream media, instead of asking the question or going out to Hawaii, I went to Hawaii twice, which is twice as much as the multi-billion dollar mainstream media combined, simply to ask questions for people that knew Obama, that knew Frank Marshall Davis.
[00:52:43.061 --> 00:53:04.023]  And I inquired a tremendous amount of information and a mountain of evidence that Obama's real biological father was, in fact, the Soviet agent Frank Marshall Davis, and that Davis radicalized Obama in his youth into this anti-white, anti-American ideology, such that when Obama wrote in his book, I went to Occidental College to study with Marxist professors.
[00:53:04.484 --> 00:53:05.265]  Well, who does that?
[00:53:06.328 --> 00:53:12.900]  Well, someone that was radicalized into this worldview went to Socialist Scholars Conferences, a Communist Party.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:18.741]  meetings in New York City at Union Hall, went to Chicago and became an organizer.
[00:53:19.161 --> 00:53:20.561]  So we asked the question.
[00:53:20.601 --> 00:53:33.184]  Now the mainstream media, in order to help Obama and cover all this up, invented a smear term, birther, and invented a religion, birtherism, to dismiss anybody who simply asked the question.
[00:53:33.444 --> 00:53:41.666]  They just as easily could have come up with the term universal, universityism, for those that wanted to see, you wanted to see his college records.
[00:53:41.946 --> 00:53:49.092]  Well, the birther thing, and now even Hillary Clinton has accused Donald Trump for being a racist for simply asking about the birth certificate.
[00:53:49.712 --> 00:53:57.139]  And the mainstream media has also been extremely critical of Alex Jones and Infowars, even implying that Donald Trump
[00:53:57.699 --> 00:54:11.803]  ...gets his intelligence reports from InfoWars and one of the crazy conspiracy theories that they always say that comes out of InfoWars, long list of them, but one of them is the birth certificate of Barack Obama.
[00:54:12.103 --> 00:54:18.264]  And check out this hit piece from CNN from just last week on the Clinton News Network.
[00:54:18.384 --> 00:54:25.286]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist and operator of the website InfoWars.
[00:54:25.746 --> 00:54:30.107]  Which seems to be a place where Trump gets a lot of his information.
[00:54:30.627 --> 00:54:35.349]  Jones can take credit for spearheading some of the most outrageous theories on the Internet.
[00:54:35.529 --> 00:54:43.051]  Jones' theories reach tens of millions each month and are now often echoed by the next President of the United States.
[00:54:43.531 --> 00:54:45.191]  Take President Obama's birth.
[00:54:45.671 --> 00:54:47.372]  Trump comes along and said,
[00:54:48.396 --> 00:54:49.236]  Birth certificate.
[00:54:49.536 --> 00:54:50.717]  He gave a birth certificate.
[00:54:51.017 --> 00:54:56.538]  Whether or not that was a real certificate, because a lot of people question it, I certainly question it.
[00:54:57.078 --> 00:54:57.719]  So there you go.
[00:54:57.779 --> 00:54:59.239]  And this is something that we're seeing.
[00:54:59.259 --> 00:55:01.960]  This is the latest thing out of the mainstream news media.
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:07.181]  It's replacing the whole conspiracy theory narrative is now the fake news narrative.
[00:55:07.281 --> 00:55:09.362]  And they are pushing this real hard right now.
[00:55:09.982 --> 00:55:13.163]  And they're also, of course, pushing the whole racist thing.
[00:55:13.403 --> 00:55:16.524]  Have you been called a racist for simply questioning the birth certificate?
[00:55:17.304 --> 00:55:18.025]  Occasionally.
[00:55:18.445 --> 00:55:22.087]  Look, I questioned his political ideology.
[00:55:22.127 --> 00:55:22.987]  Where did it come from?
[00:55:23.007 --> 00:55:30.791]  I think we've proven that the real biological father who became the ideological mentor was Frank Marshall Davis.
[00:55:30.851 --> 00:55:31.872]  Obama's even admitted it.
[00:55:32.512 --> 00:55:39.777]  And that reveals a radical ideology and it debunks his candidacy where he said he was a mainstream candidate.
[00:55:40.617 --> 00:55:49.282]  The birth certificates I'm releasing today with you guys for the first time, it's a black man born in Hawaii a few weeks before Obama and another one born a few weeks after.
[00:55:50.003 --> 00:55:58.368]  Most people are familiar with the fact that Obama's father's race on his birth certificate is listed as African, a term African-American was never used at that time.
[00:55:58.388 --> 00:55:59.189]  That's right, this is the 60s.
[00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:05.773]  And the state of Hawaii had very strict criteria that they use at the Department of Health to designate race.
[00:56:06.093 --> 00:56:12.417]  And of course the birth certificates I'm releasing, they show the race of the father as Negro, not African.
[00:56:13.217 --> 00:56:19.461]  And you can even just see how Obama's document is based on a white background and how phony it looks.
[00:56:19.921 --> 00:56:24.084]  I think the reason Obama refused to release it for several years and ended up being forced to
[00:56:24.724 --> 00:56:40.851]  Was because had he released it, it would have revealed probably the father being blank, unknown, or possibly even Frank Marshall Davis that would have debunked his entire story of the international marriage and his father being from Kenya.
[00:56:41.192 --> 00:56:46.074]  And it would reveal his entire political ideology was very different from what he told the electorate.
[00:56:46.394 --> 00:56:52.900]  So, and I think this, do you think this is a sleight of hand or a diversion to talk about him being born in Kenya?
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:57:01.948]  That that was the conspiracy theory, but the real evidence suggests that the cover-up and the forgery was to cover up the fact that his real father was Frank Marshall Davis.
[00:57:02.467 --> 00:57:14.192]  I think Obama used the Kenyan father at various times in his life to create a sexier background or a more interesting story when it served him, very possibly when he went to Occidental College.
[00:57:14.572 --> 00:57:19.074]  He probably was there as a foreign student, either from Indonesia or a Kenyan background.
[00:57:20.275 --> 00:57:24.337]  He used, of course, the Kenyan father to hide his connection to Frank Marshall Davis.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:34.104]  And his entire life and political career he's been trying to hide that connection because it would expose all the radicalism that we've seen in his presidency.
[00:57:34.424 --> 00:57:42.508]  When did he learn himself, and you have a story about the airport incident, where he learned that Frank Marshall Davis was his father?
[00:57:42.728 --> 00:57:49.369]  Well, Keith Kakegawa, his best friend, who he refers to as Ray in his book, Dreams for My Father, I've befriended.
[00:57:49.389 --> 00:57:51.490]  He's in Corcoran State Prison in Central California.
[00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:53.150]  I visited him there several times.
[00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:54.770]  We exchanged many phone calls and letters.
[00:57:55.211 --> 00:58:10.153]  And he told me this amazing story that Keith himself was with Obama in the Alamanoa Mall in Waikiki, 1977, and Obama recognized the Kenyan Obama in a sporting goods store, ran over and said, are you Barack Obama?
[00:58:10.174 --> 00:58:10.734]  He said, yes.
[00:58:12.794 --> 00:58:18.658]  The Kenyan said he was there at the layover from Hong Kong going back to Kenya, and he kind of blew him off and left.
[00:58:19.398 --> 00:58:32.487]  And Keith explained that from that moment, Barack, Barry as he called him, just went nuts for about three months demanding the truth be told by Frank, by his mom, by his grandfather, that he knows that Frank is the real father.
[00:58:33.047 --> 00:58:37.570]  He said that Frank looks like him, gives him money, spends time with him, and they've all lied to him.
[00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:40.111]  And eventually this was,
[00:58:41.482 --> 00:58:41.602]  Wow.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
