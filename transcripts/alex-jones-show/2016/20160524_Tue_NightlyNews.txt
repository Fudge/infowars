[00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.143]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.183 --> 00:00:26.024]  It is Tuesday, May 24th, 2016, and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:27.285]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:41.290]  Tonight, welcome to Faceception, a new software program that can reveal your secrets by simply analyzing your face.
[00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:49.606]  And they've already signed a contract with Homeland Security to identify pedophiles and terrorists.
[00:00:50.486 --> 00:00:56.088]  Meanwhile, an NBC News report is promoting the microchipping of children.
[00:00:56.508 --> 00:01:01.749]  They say it will happen sooner or later, so you might as well get with the program.
[00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.251]  You're putting a battery in your kid, you're putting a chip in your kid, and we're stuck.
[00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.073]  And Bill Cosby will finally stand trial on sexual assault charges.
[00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:15.614]  So what about Bill and Hillary Clinton?
[00:01:15.654 --> 00:01:20.317]  Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[00:01:20.437 --> 00:01:24.119]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:16.755]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify.
[00:02:17.115 --> 00:02:18.575]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:19.976]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:21.376]  And I know this for a fact.
[00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:26.697]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.558]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.759]  I believe our research is conclusive.
[00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.139]  This is the best iodine out there.
[00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.300]  Take advantage of this at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:10.585]  Well Hawaii wants to become the first state to register gun owners into a federal database and of course they expect other states to follow.
[00:03:10.885 --> 00:03:20.769]  Now this is under a bill proposed by Senator Will Espero and he says that Hawaii would enter gun owners into an FBI database and it'd be available to local police.
[00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:29.212]  Now the FBI already has a similar database, but it's only, they say, for people in positions in trust, like school teachers and other public officials.
[00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:33.633]  But Hawaii would be the first to enter gun owners into a database.
[00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.915]  And of course, people there are rightly concerned, saying that
[00:03:38.175 --> 00:03:43.400]  This is basically saying Big Brother is going to be watching us and they'll know right where the guns are so they can go and grab them.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.462]  And they're not unfounded with these fears.
[00:03:46.502 --> 00:03:53.328]  Of course, New York had a similar registry in place that was, of course, used by the police to confiscate firearms.
[00:03:53.388 --> 00:04:01.295]  It was the Safe Act of 2013 and the NYPD sent out notices to registered gun owners demanding they give up their guns.
[00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:05.299]  It ordered them, those who possess firearms, to either
[00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.722]  Surrender them, remove them from the city limits, or otherwise render them inoperable.
[00:04:10.862 --> 00:04:15.104]  And of course, the only people that complied were non-criminals.
[00:04:15.925 --> 00:04:22.689]  Because the criminals, of course, did not listen to these orders of rendering their handguns and things like that inoperable.
[00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:28.572]  And of course, as we've seen, them actually killing police officers in that state, as well as many other crimes.
[00:04:28.892 --> 00:04:31.534]  So again, this is a big thing of confiscating
[00:04:32.014 --> 00:04:35.996]  Firearms from law-abiding citizens, just like what happened in Venezuela.
[00:04:36.356 --> 00:04:45.101]  Now, coming up later in the show, I'm going to be talking with David Knight about some very scary similarities between what's happening in Venezuela and some things we're seeing here in the United States.
[00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:47.302]  But only four years ago,
[00:04:47.822 --> 00:04:50.284]  Venezuela banned guns for private citizens.
[00:04:50.324 --> 00:04:53.146]  They said that the only people that should have them are military and police.
[00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:55.448]  And now we see what's going on in that country.
[00:04:55.488 --> 00:04:56.669]  So this is only four years ago.
[00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:01.672]  They were already experiencing food rations and energy rations, things like that back then.
[00:05:01.852 --> 00:05:07.937]  So you think the government didn't really see the writing on the wall, didn't know what was going to be happening there, that the collapse was imminent.
[00:05:08.317 --> 00:05:13.921]  And so, of course, they've put forth these gun confiscation plans, a gun ban for private citizens.
[00:05:14.362 --> 00:05:15.723]  So we'll be talking about that coming up.
[00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:16.731]  Later.
[00:05:17.072 --> 00:05:20.494]  But that's not the only database that the federal government is working on.
[00:05:20.534 --> 00:05:27.059]  They've also got a massive biometric database and now the FBI is wanting to keep that a secret.
[00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:39.769]  They are saying all the information that the FBI stores as part of this biometric database should be kept from anyone who might, you know, request to know if their information is stored there in the records.
[00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:50.036]  It's known as the Next Generation Identification System, and it draws biometric data from passport registration, security checks, and judicial processing.
[00:05:50.676 --> 00:05:54.979]  It includes biometric records on foreigners as well, but it's not just fingerprints.
[00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:55.880]  I don't know.
[00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:29.436]  Letting people know about their information that they hold in this database could compromise ongoing authorized law enforcement and national security efforts.
[00:06:30.117 --> 00:06:35.384]  But the FBI also adds that the agency could be using this data to catch future criminals.
[00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:48.228]  And so, of course, we know exactly what's going on with the whole pre-crime thing, and they want to be able to store this data, everyone's data, in the event that you maybe one day become a possible criminal.
[00:06:48.468 --> 00:06:56.109]  Now, of course, that's great if you're going to be a terrorist, but we all know that they've been tracking activists, or like the Black Lives Matter movement, people were being tracked.
[00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:02.891]  Even in the hashtags, they were using surveillance on social media to just see where these groups were going.
[00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:04.831]  So these are not violent criminals.
[00:07:05.212 --> 00:07:09.833]  I mean, some of them did, of course, do some pretty stupid things in their activism.
[00:07:10.253 --> 00:07:18.635]  But, you know, these are people who are going to be looking at the government, especially as the years go on and we're in these very heated political times.
[00:07:19.195 --> 00:07:31.779]  And, you know, it kind of gives some credence to the Obama administration trying to reword the term criminals, because if we're all in this database, I guess we're all going to be known as justice involved individuals.
[00:07:31.859 --> 00:07:31.979]  So.
[00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:34.481]  Maybe we do need to change that term.
[00:07:34.501 --> 00:07:41.247]  Now, even smaller cities across the United States are getting into this massive high-tech crime surveillance.
[00:07:41.808 --> 00:07:48.254]  In Hartford, Connecticut, they've just recently unveiled their real-time crime and data intelligence center.
[00:07:48.354 --> 00:07:51.116]  It helps officers on the streets find suspects.
[00:07:52.117 --> 00:07:55.338]  And avoid harm by quickly giving them crucial information.
[00:07:55.839 --> 00:08:18.868]  New York City opened the first of its kind real-time crime center in 2005, and now a lot of other smaller cities across the country are opening up their own centers, acquiring surveillance cameras, gunshot detectors, and other technology, which of course we've told you about here as well, which is even your street lights, recording your conversations, crosswalk signs, things like that.
[00:08:18.948 --> 00:08:19.588]  So they've got these
[00:08:20.188 --> 00:08:31.421]  Cropping up everywhere, building this huge surveillance panopticon, and they will send these videos even directly to police officers' cell phones in real time.
[00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:33.103]  So this is what's happening.
[00:08:33.683 --> 00:08:37.828]  And now we even have a startup saying that they can predict
[00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:54.792]  Just by analyzing your face, whether you're a terrorist or a pedophile, and this is what they always, they always bring out these sort of terms, like, no, this technology is only going to be used to stop terrorism or pedophiles, because they know these are things that people can get on board with.
[00:08:54.952 --> 00:08:55.552]  Oh, that's fine.
[00:08:55.592 --> 00:08:56.033]  I don't care.
[00:08:56.153 --> 00:08:56.533]  Go ahead.
[00:08:56.593 --> 00:09:00.955]  Put me in your biometric database as long as you'll stop pedophiles or terrorists.
[00:09:01.235 --> 00:09:03.696]  But as we know, everyone's going to be in this database.
[00:09:03.896 --> 00:09:09.038]  Everyone is going to be affected and everyone is going to be considered a justice-involved individual.
[00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:10.799]  Now, this is an Israeli startup.
[00:09:11.239 --> 00:09:18.483]  It says all it has to do is take one look at a person's face and realize the character traits that are undetectable to the human eye.
[00:09:18.543 --> 00:09:23.045]  Basically, they say that our DNA makes up our face and this is what determines whether or not we're
[00:09:23.465 --> 00:09:24.426]  We're good to go.
[00:09:46.288 --> 00:09:46.888]  We're good to go.
[00:10:03.539 --> 00:10:03.940]  I think.
[00:10:19.063 --> 00:10:20.264]  Or, you know, how does this work?
[00:10:20.664 --> 00:10:22.826]  So we can all see the writing on the wall.
[00:10:22.866 --> 00:10:25.848]  This is totally minority report and pre-crime.
[00:10:26.249 --> 00:10:42.141]  But now we have NBC coming out and really pushing the safety aspect of microchipping your children and just from a young age starting them up and putting them in the surveillance database because of course it'll keep them safe.
[00:10:42.641 --> 00:10:46.904]  And the NBC News report actually promotes that the microchipping of children
[00:10:47.725 --> 00:10:55.496]  It's just going to happen sooner rather than later, and then Americans are eventually just going to accept the process as something just as normal as the barcode.
[00:10:56.545 --> 00:10:58.387]  This is what we're talking about, the microchip.
[00:10:58.427 --> 00:10:59.728]  I don't know if you can see it in my hand.
[00:10:59.788 --> 00:11:01.390]  It's the size of a grain of rice.
[00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:02.751]  Very, very small.
[00:11:03.152 --> 00:11:15.565]  And the expert that we spoke with actually tells us that barcodes were introduced in the late 1960s, and back then people thought, uh, this is way too invasive and too weird, and now barcodes are so commonplace that we don't even think about them anymore.
[00:11:15.845 --> 00:11:19.088]  The expert tells us this will happen sooner rather than later.
[00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:34.920]  So, as you can see, NBC is doing its job and just really extolling the virtues of the microchipping of your children, really aggressively promoting the safety aspect of this rather than the concerns over the Orwellian scope of...
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.580]  Microchipping your children.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:45.523]  So then the piece goes on back to an electronics expert, Stuart Lipoff, who asserts that microchipping children is safe and inevitable.
[00:11:45.623 --> 00:11:47.424]  So just go ahead and get with the program.
[00:11:47.864 --> 00:11:50.925]  People should be aware that testing is being done right now.
[00:11:51.325 --> 00:11:55.787]  The military is not only testing this out, but already utilizes its properties.
[00:11:56.107 --> 00:11:58.448]  It's not a matter of if it will happen, but when.
[00:11:59.008 --> 00:11:59.188]  I don't
[00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:18.030]  I think so.
[00:12:36.733 --> 00:12:38.315]  But it could definitely happen.
[00:12:38.855 --> 00:12:45.142]  AI could take over resources such as money, land, and water so that it can establish monopoly over access to them.
[00:12:45.542 --> 00:12:51.589]  They could take over political control of local and federal governments, as well as international corporations and charities.
[00:12:52.049 --> 00:12:56.414]  Robots could reveal informational hazards, threaten society's structures.
[00:12:56.754 --> 00:12:59.317]  They could also set up a total surveillance state
[00:12:59.757 --> 00:13:06.341]  Or exploit an existing one, reducing any notion of privacy to zero, including privacy of thought.
[00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:08.762]  Of course, since you have those microchips in your brain.
[00:13:09.463 --> 00:13:16.467]  And AI could force a merger by requiring that all people have a brain implant, which allows for direct mind control.
[00:13:16.887 --> 00:13:20.509]  And of course, it says they could also enslave mankind.
[00:13:20.669 --> 00:13:25.912]  Now, these are some far-off ideas that we see in sci-fi films, but these are
[00:13:26.152 --> 00:13:27.193]  Thanks for having us.
[00:13:45.342 --> 00:13:53.889]  Now, another breaking news that came out today, we're finding out that Bill Cosby is going to stand trial on those sex assault charges.
[00:13:54.269 --> 00:14:03.737]  The judge heard the rape accuser's claims that the actor told her to drink wine and take herbal medication to relax before an unconscious assault.
[00:14:04.317 --> 00:14:11.423]  So, also we found this week that due to a deposition that he gave years ago, he admitted
[00:14:11.823 --> 00:14:26.245]  To sexually assaulting teenagers, also drugging them, and also that models were sent over by the agency some six to seven per week in order to, you know, be so he could drug and rape them.
[00:14:26.986 --> 00:14:34.250]  He's a serial predator, but of course protected by the media, much like another Bill who is again being protected by the media as well.
[00:14:34.591 --> 00:14:41.034]  Now NBC News is calling Donald Trump's latest attack ad another low.
[00:14:41.475 --> 00:14:49.960]  They're saying, you know, just bringing up these allegations of sexual misconduct against Bill Clinton from the past, these are decades old, and this is a new low.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.282]  And do you know what is actually another low?
[00:14:53.723 --> 00:14:58.186]  Covering the actions of a serial predator for political profit.
[00:14:58.366 --> 00:15:03.010]  And Donald Trump seems to be the only one doing what the media refuses to do.
[00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:04.051]  Calling them out.
[00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:07.033]  Now we have another Alex Jones calling out.
[00:15:07.714 --> 00:15:24.908]  Glennedict Arnold, Glenn Beck, American psycho Trojan horse, because even after Facebook has admitted censorship, Glenn Beck, the establishment media man that he is, still denies that it's going on because he is setting himself up to be Zuckerberg's manservant.
[00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:32.595]  And Facebook, of course, has admitted that it is rogue, you know, it's rogue employees may have shown bias against conservatives.
[00:15:32.956 --> 00:15:41.063]  And we had activist Lauren Southern on the show today explaining how that exact thing happened to her with moderators being given too much power.
[00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:43.846]  Lauren Southern, thanks for joining us.
[00:15:44.946 --> 00:15:46.027]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me.
[00:15:46.628 --> 00:15:50.852]  Wow, so, I mean, break this story down for us and your view on it.
[00:15:52.205 --> 00:16:00.190]  Right, so I had a friend of mine post on Facebook that Donald Trump doesn't hate Muslims, he just wants to defend the country from ISIS.
[00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:05.334]  There was nothing lewd about the comment, it was purely his political opinion.
[00:16:05.894 --> 00:16:08.856]  And it was removed by Facebook, and he was issued a ban.
[00:16:09.463 --> 00:16:19.815]  So I took that post, he sent me a screenshot on Skype and I shared it on my Facebook and said that it's absolutely disgusting what Facebook is doing to conservatives and they need to stop.
[00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:28.226]  And not only a couple minutes later or maybe an hour later I go check my Facebook and it does the whole
[00:16:28.746 --> 00:16:30.267]  You've been logged out of your account.
[00:16:30.327 --> 00:16:34.308]  That's always the note that you get when you're in crap with Zuckerberg.
[00:16:34.588 --> 00:16:36.969]  And then you log back in and it tells you what you did wrong.
[00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:38.570]  I've been banned a few times now.
[00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:39.770]  But now it's 30 days.
[00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.031]  I guess next is going to be forever.
[00:16:41.852 --> 00:16:42.512]  I know, I know.
[00:16:42.532 --> 00:16:49.335]  They will remove your account next time, which is kind of scary because I have 30,000 followers on there that I try to show my political opinions to.
[00:16:49.835 --> 00:16:54.057]  But they removed my post for complaining about Facebook censoring conservatives.
[00:16:55.057 --> 00:16:56.477]  Is this not total 1984?
[00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:59.238]  They admit they're doing it, it's happening, there's a Senate investigation.
[00:16:59.719 --> 00:17:04.040]  You talk about it, and then they remove it and say it doesn't exist.
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:04.941]  I mean, that is incredible.
[00:17:05.761 --> 00:17:05.921]  Yeah.
[00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:07.241]  Oh, it's absolutely incredible.
[00:17:07.321 --> 00:17:07.922]  And you know what?
[00:17:09.574 --> 00:17:16.718]  I only, I've been banned before for posts that should not have been banned and I could not contact Facebook to get my account back and just had to wait a week.
[00:17:17.198 --> 00:17:24.842]  If I had not been, if InfoWars had not reported on this, if Drudge Report had not reported on this, Facebook wouldn't have given a crap.
[00:17:24.882 --> 00:17:27.843]  They would have left me banned and my account may have disappeared by now.
[00:17:29.584 --> 00:17:30.784]  But they wanted to save face.
[00:17:30.845 --> 00:17:35.347]  They wanted to save face so they contacted my personal email and said that this was
[00:17:36.397 --> 00:17:38.218]  Caused by human error.
[00:17:38.719 --> 00:17:40.580]  Now, everyone knows the moderators.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.166]  When you flag a post on Facebook, the moderator has to look at it and decide, does this fit our community standards?
[00:17:48.266 --> 00:17:49.907]  And that moderator looked at that post,
[00:17:50.765 --> 00:18:00.888]  Twice, because he first banned the first one that was removed, and then looked at the second one, where I was complaining about it being removed, and banned that one as well.
[00:18:00.948 --> 00:18:02.969]  That wasn't just an accident.
[00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:04.230]  That was on purpose.
[00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:05.590]  And Facebook knows it.
[00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.571]  They've come out and finally admitted it.
[00:18:07.911 --> 00:18:13.373]  And yet you still have establishment people like Glenn Beck coming out and saying, this isn't happening.
[00:18:13.853 --> 00:18:15.333]  I don't know why he's saying that.
[00:18:15.413 --> 00:18:16.354]  It's very strange.
[00:18:16.414 --> 00:18:19.975]  Maybe it's because it's majority Trump supporters that are being banned.
[00:18:20.595 --> 00:18:24.198]  I don't know, but it's definitely happening and it's very scary.
[00:18:24.238 --> 00:18:30.803]  You have 60% of millennials get the majority of their news from Facebook in that trending timeline.
[00:18:31.564 --> 00:18:35.047]  How much damage is this doing that they're not getting both sides of the story?
[00:19:04.895 --> 00:19:09.297]  There's a very important question that needs to be answered.
[00:19:10.437 --> 00:19:12.098]  Will humanity survive?
[00:19:13.758 --> 00:19:15.759]  And to look at that threat we have to ask another question.
[00:19:16.439 --> 00:19:27.183]  What is the number one obstacle to human beings and our species surviving and becoming a type 1 civilization that isn't just dependent on this planet?
[00:19:28.854 --> 00:19:39.220]  You could say that it's changes in the heavens, suns going supernova, tectonic earthquake and volcano events, nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.
[00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:50.126]  But if you look at the race, the acceleration of technological development, I think the biggest threat overall is humanity not pacing ourselves.
[00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:53.345]  We're good to go.
[00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:23.386]  Seeks black market brain implants in bid to plug into artificial intelligence matrix.
[00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:31.934]  And they're going to go through the dangerous surgeries of being hooked up, not just with a few wires, but with thousands of connections total to the brain.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:37.418]  to an AI computer to try to merge consciousness.
[00:20:37.878 --> 00:20:46.732]  My father, a physician, recently went back to continuing education, part of keeping his medical license, and he brought me back some of the literature they gave them.
[00:20:47.172 --> 00:20:47.934]  This is from the state
[00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:53.499]  Medical boards right here in Texas that soon you'll have to have a DNA chip to get a prescription.
[00:20:54.039 --> 00:21:10.395]  Not just that chips are going to be on the pills and medicines themselves, but now you're going to have to give your blood, basically every time, a tiny prick, into a DNA chip database that tracks everything going on in your body as well as your genes.
[00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:13.878]  In this short report we're only scratching the surface.
[00:21:15.424 --> 00:21:20.991]  And the big issue here is things they denied 20, 30 years ago that were going on, they're now admitting today.
[00:21:21.632 --> 00:21:23.995]  What are they doing that we don't know about?
[00:21:25.014 --> 00:21:26.715]  We need to have a debate about our species.
[00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:42.005]  We need to understand that the global elite have decided we're obsolete and are moving towards a robotic future where there's no place for humanity, as Bill Joy wrote over 15 years ago for Wired Magazine in his article, Why the Future Doesn't Meet Us.
[00:21:42.826 --> 00:21:43.866]  And the numbers are in.
[00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:45.207]  Screen time.
[00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:46.488]  All the television.
[00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:48.329]  All the prescription drugs.
[00:21:48.389 --> 00:21:50.251]  This modern culture is killing us.
[00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:51.712]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.153]  People are becoming more and more ignorant.
[00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.934]  Society is unraveling and falling apart.
[00:21:58.374 --> 00:22:04.097]  So we know that the fruits of this high-tech poison tree are literally killing us.
[00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:17.542]  The answer is getting back to healthy living, gardening, spending time with our families, less screen time, and also using compounds that Mother Nature has produced that are known to boost our natural abilities.
[00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:19.763]  Humans have built an incredible world.
[00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.424]  We can change our environment.
[00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:30.126]  We do have that magic spark, but the elite think we're ugly and bad and have decided it's time that humans be thrown on the ash heap of history.
[00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:46.631]  We have taken some of the compounds that Mother Nature has produced and gotten the cleanest, purest sources of it and put it together in BrainForce, one of the most highly reviewed nootropic brain boosters on the market today that has an incredibly affordable price.
[00:22:47.091 --> 00:22:53.816]  Check out Brain Force today and other game-changing compounds like X2, Survival Shield, at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:23:06.144 --> 00:23:21.660]  New World Order pawns, unbeknownstly posing as bleeding heart liberal pundits thirsty for the rewards promised them by their globalist masters, are ushering in nothing less than a modern day inquisition targeted at so-called climate deniers.
[00:23:21.921 --> 00:23:26.265]  The scourge of falsehoods has now reached American college campuses.
[00:23:26.506 --> 00:23:27.787]  The Weather Channel reports
[00:23:28.027 --> 00:23:36.193]  A resolution passed by the Portland, Oregon School Board will eliminate words like may, might, and could from the district's curriculum.
[00:23:36.533 --> 00:23:40.516]  But it's not English lessons where these words will cease to appear.
[00:23:40.776 --> 00:23:46.440]  Rather, it's in science classes, in the context of climate change and its causes.
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:57.448]  Last week, the Portland Public School Board unanimously passed a resolution which directs schools to abandon the use of any adopted text material that is found to express doubt
[00:23:57.668 --> 00:24:02.070]  about the severity of the climate crisis or its root in human activities.
[00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:10.654]  The resolution broadly calls for all Portland schools to develop an implementation plan for climate literacy.
[00:24:10.854 --> 00:24:15.076]  Where have we heard this attack on the minds of our future before?
[00:24:15.377 --> 00:24:23.060]  When my opponents say we won't join you, I just say your children are mine already.
[00:24:51.473 --> 00:24:58.694]  As far-fetched as those examples may appear, just take a look at the alarmist panic sweeping Washington, D.C.
[00:24:58.834 --> 00:25:03.595]  due to lining the pockets of Al Chicken Little Gore with carbon taxes.
[00:25:03.775 --> 00:25:05.976]  Let's take a look at the boogeyman himself.
[00:25:06.556 --> 00:25:22.621]  Here are a few of the most inconvenient lies presented by Al Gore and debunked by British Judge Justice Michael Burton and the Science and Public Policy Institute in 2007, when Gore's An Inconvenient Truth was being considered as part of the public school system.
[00:25:23.061 --> 00:25:28.586]  Newsmax writes, The expected 20-foot rise in sea levels caused by melting ice caps.
[00:25:28.846 --> 00:25:34.832]  The judge accepted that this rise might happen, but only over the course of thousands of years.
[00:25:35.232 --> 00:25:37.674]  The shutting down of the ocean conveyor.
[00:25:37.874 --> 00:25:45.181]  The judge claimed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said this Gulf Stream may slow down, but it won't stop completely.
[00:25:45.541 --> 00:25:52.686]  In the Al Gore global warming movie, the former vice president says the hurricanes are getting stronger due to global warming.
[00:25:52.946 --> 00:26:01.533]  The Science and Public Policy Institute says there has been no change in the strength of hurricanes over the past six decades.
[00:26:01.873 --> 00:26:04.575]  Gore said Pacific islands are drowning.
[00:26:04.855 --> 00:26:16.738]  Science and Public Policy points out that Gore's claim that low-lying islands near New Zealand are being evacuated is not due to global warming, but the unwise dynamite practices of the local fishermen.
[00:26:16.938 --> 00:26:22.039]  Eric Steig of realclimate.org points out some further flaws in the movie's science.
[00:26:22.419 --> 00:26:26.380]  A link between CO2 emissions and invasive plant species.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.501]  Gore makes this link.
[00:26:28.861 --> 00:26:34.282]  Steig says the invasive plant species is due to changes in the way land is being used.
[00:26:34.702 --> 00:26:35.823]  Not global warming.
[00:26:36.143 --> 00:26:37.564]  Sorry, New World Order.
[00:26:37.824 --> 00:26:44.147]  The brainwashing is so historically cyclical that the growing majority isn't buying it anymore.
[00:26:44.527 --> 00:27:01.716]  Science is going to produce a new way to power our civilization that is so sensational that we will turn off our use of CO2 and when we turn off our fossil fuel, the whole thing's over.
[00:27:02.518 --> 00:27:03.118]  It's over!
[00:27:03.138 --> 00:27:05.139]  We're not producing any more CO2!
[00:27:05.499 --> 00:27:07.480]  They don't have a basis to complain!
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.981]  Their whole breakfast dies!
[00:27:10.321 --> 00:27:19.724]  In fact, it's only a matter of time before the true culprits responsible for the rising water levels and disappearing coastlines are held accountable.
[00:27:19.924 --> 00:27:25.947]  The globalist corporatocracy is devouring the world's coastlines with zero regulations.
[00:27:26.307 --> 00:27:32.009]  Sand is essential to make toothpaste, detergents, computers, mobile phones, our homes,
[00:27:32.449 --> 00:27:33.490]  Skyscrapers!
[00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:35.751]  And that's just scraping the surface.
[00:27:36.051 --> 00:27:37.352]  No pun intended.
[00:27:37.652 --> 00:27:43.775]  Sand is the most widely consumed natural resource on planet Earth, second only to fresh water.
[00:27:44.095 --> 00:27:45.076]  Follow the money!
[00:27:45.316 --> 00:27:49.679]  Are you actually surprised that the globalists are the true threat to the planet Earth?
[00:27:49.859 --> 00:27:56.102]  They will extract every dime from it and us until the devastation is irreversible.
[00:27:56.362 --> 00:27:57.743]  And who gets the blame?
[00:27:58.003 --> 00:28:01.145]  As a handful of globalists sit in their palatial mansions,
[00:28:01.425 --> 00:28:05.487]  It's very reasonable that the recent trouble in Paris is a result of climate change.
[00:28:22.913 --> 00:28:28.455]  Small and medium farmers have abandoned their farms because there's not enough water, not enough rainfall.
[00:28:29.015 --> 00:28:31.896]  Young people have gone to the big cities looking for work.
[00:28:32.296 --> 00:28:33.676]  There's not enough work for everybody.
[00:28:34.596 --> 00:28:47.620]  So the disaffected youth, as we say, the young people who don't believe in the system, believe the system's failed, are more easily engaged and more easily recruited by terrorist organizations.
[00:28:53.334 --> 00:28:56.835]  Indiana officials, 85 tests positive for TB bacteria.
[00:28:56.855 --> 00:28:59.196]  Oh, and they wonder why it's suddenly exploding all over.
[00:28:59.856 --> 00:29:02.697]  Four refugees with infectious tuberculosis sent to Indiana.
[00:29:03.637 --> 00:29:06.097]  This is where they admit they sent people there that they knew had it.
[00:29:06.157 --> 00:29:06.778]  Now, let's continue.
[00:29:07.058 --> 00:29:08.998]  It's a lot more than that.
[00:29:09.158 --> 00:29:10.759]  Record 499 Syrian refugees admitted to the U.S.
[00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:12.399]  Folks, it's thousands in Austin.
[00:29:13.699 --> 00:29:15.140]  Number one, that's a lie, but listen to this.
[00:29:16.258 --> 00:29:18.699]  Record 499 Syrian refugees admitted to U.S.
[00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:19.940]  so far in May.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.560]  No Christians.
[00:29:22.141 --> 00:29:23.681]  Syria is 20% Christians.
[00:29:23.961 --> 00:29:25.082]  They're the real refugees.
[00:29:25.182 --> 00:29:27.443]  Obama will not let them in.
[00:29:28.163 --> 00:29:28.784]  Welcome back.
[00:29:28.844 --> 00:29:30.024]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:29:30.564 --> 00:29:34.026]  Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, is going to be joining us to cover the waterfront.
[00:29:35.606 --> 00:29:38.548]  The full spectrum of news and take your phone calls.
[00:29:38.948 --> 00:29:41.670]  His latest articles up on Infowars.com.
[00:29:42.451 --> 00:29:46.814]  CIA links top Hillary donor Soros to terrorist bombing.
[00:29:46.854 --> 00:29:49.716]  Soros is a major contributor to Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[00:29:49.736 --> 00:29:52.598]  I mean, we've got the Polish deputy minister.
[00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:54.500]  We've got, you know, the president.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.081]  We've got the president of Hungary.
[00:29:57.141 --> 00:30:00.644]  We've got German leaders in their Bundestag.
[00:30:01.304 --> 00:30:01.785]  We've got
[00:30:04.042 --> 00:30:08.165]  Just incredible news here and documents being released.
[00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:12.068]  There's multiple declassifications on Soros right now.
[00:30:13.349 --> 00:30:14.369]  It's just incredible.
[00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.152]  It's incredible how evil this guy is.
[00:30:18.552 --> 00:30:20.353]  He even tried to crash the British Pound.
[00:30:20.413 --> 00:30:26.558]  So in the new James Bond movie, the Quantum Group is the private corporation behind Spectre.
[00:30:27.638 --> 00:30:32.562]  And there's a George Soros character that just wants to ruin the world and be mean because he hates people.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.361]  This is the real head of Spectre.
[00:30:40.702 --> 00:30:42.402]  Just give me a break, man.
[00:30:42.462 --> 00:30:48.224]  Some weird Nazi collaborator who actually has cats and an oxygen tank?
[00:30:51.545 --> 00:30:53.786]  Yes, we will kill James Bond.
[00:30:55.146 --> 00:30:56.667]  I mean, you cannot make it up.
[00:30:56.727 --> 00:30:57.487]  Give me a break.
[00:30:59.824 --> 00:31:00.944]  And I said this before, it's just weird.
[00:31:01.504 --> 00:31:02.745]  Both my grandfathers are dead now.
[00:31:02.785 --> 00:31:04.405]  They were both in World War II in the Army Air Corps.
[00:31:04.625 --> 00:31:06.565]  They barely, both of them barely survived.
[00:31:09.986 --> 00:31:12.367]  One of them in a crash landing, the other, you know, plane shot up.
[00:31:16.508 --> 00:31:19.628]  And then their base got bombed, my dad's dad, and he got hurt, purple heart.
[00:31:20.008 --> 00:31:21.909]  So it wasn't, didn't go up and then...
[00:31:23.052 --> 00:31:25.033]  Few missions in, his whole crew got killed.
[00:31:26.034 --> 00:31:27.735]  Barely didn't make it, fighting the Nazis.
[00:31:28.175 --> 00:31:35.399]  And then I've got to sit here and you've got to sit there with a guy who was all the way back in World War II, a top Nazi collaborator, helping round people up.
[00:31:35.599 --> 00:31:36.960]  We have to put up with his crap.
[00:31:39.881 --> 00:31:49.327]  And then the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL give him awards as a Jewish leader when he is the greatest living Nazi war criminal.
[00:31:50.307 --> 00:31:54.088]  And then he runs Media Matters and all these other groups attacking us.
[00:31:55.889 --> 00:31:59.791]  You people that work at those places, you are just horrible people!
[00:32:02.672 --> 00:32:10.735]  Because you're not just calling me a Nazi, you work for one who's anti-free speech and is putting Nazis in, in places like Ukraine.
[00:32:10.975 --> 00:32:13.076]  I mean, how freakish is that?
[00:32:16.772 --> 00:32:17.572]  I just can't believe it.
[00:32:17.692 --> 00:32:18.993]  It's just, it's so rich!
[00:32:19.073 --> 00:32:20.794]  It's just such horse manure!
[00:32:24.655 --> 00:32:26.976]  I've had Media Matters call me before, years ago, just for fun.
[00:32:27.016 --> 00:32:29.297]  I'd actually do the interview with their so-called, you know, editor.
[00:32:29.337 --> 00:32:31.217]  They go, and you're not any Semitic?
[00:32:31.237 --> 00:32:33.138]  And I'm like, no, not like George Soros that funds you.
[00:32:33.498 --> 00:32:34.359]  He doesn't fund us.
[00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:38.220]  I pulled up election commission documents while I was talking to him and said he was their number one funder.
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.641]  And they went, well, thanks for the interview.
[00:32:43.086 --> 00:32:47.268]  And I said all you were doing this for was to act like you were actually a journalist.
[00:32:47.288 --> 00:32:48.968]  You're not a journalist, you're a hack!
[00:32:50.229 --> 00:33:00.612]  Our government's funding Sunni radical Muslims that have killed 300,000 people conservatively in Syria, most of them Christians, and Obama won't let one out.
[00:33:02.353 --> 00:33:04.734]  A lot of people ask me what is the most important
[00:33:06.286 --> 00:33:06.546]  I think?
[00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:38.612]  When I talk about the people at InfoWars, from customer service, the shipping department, being just as important as our anchors, our researchers, our investigative journalists, and myself, it's absolutely true.
[00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:44.536]  Without this team that we've built over the last 20 plus years, we wouldn't be able to do any of what we've been doing.
[00:33:44.916 --> 00:33:50.199]  And that's what's so exciting because we finally built up to a point where we now have the launch pad.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.882]  Introducing AutoShip from InfoWarsLive.com, a new way to save time and money when you stock up on InfoWarsStore.com products.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:34:05.626]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when products are sold out, you're unable to get them, sometimes for months, but we hold back the products for people that have already signed up for AutoShip.

[00:34:21.033 --> 00:34:28.437]  Listers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products when you need them each month.
[00:34:29.474 --> 00:34:30.494]  Now it's finally here.
[00:34:30.954 --> 00:34:34.455]  AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:35.255]  It's easy.

[00:34:42.937 --> 00:34:49.699]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, it's a sure win.
[00:34:49.859 --> 00:34:53.400]  You add to that free shipping on orders of $50, it is a can't lose.

[00:35:12.352 --> 00:35:17.838]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:32.554]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:40.639]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:46.223]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:35:46.243 --> 00:35:49.765]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:35:49.925 --> 00:35:53.888]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:36:01.895]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigerex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:07.460]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.043]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[00:36:11.183 --> 00:36:15.207]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:19.211]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[00:36:19.671 --> 00:36:19.911]  I think so.
[00:37:04.281 --> 00:37:09.967]  Now Larry Nichols is former Green Beret, Special Ops, working for the CIA, you name it.
[00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:11.468]  Obviously he's not supposed to get into all that.
[00:37:12.229 --> 00:37:16.894]  And then went to basically interface with the Dixie Mafia that runs the South.
[00:37:17.895 --> 00:37:19.797]  The Dixie Mafia is the shadow government.
[00:37:19.817 --> 00:37:20.617]  It's mainly Democrats.
[00:37:21.919 --> 00:37:23.340]  Democrats here in town are Dixie Mafia.
[00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:28.078]  You know, they run the show.
[00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:33.601]  And then when the Clintons started killing kids and stuff, he said, look, I'm not going to be part of killing 13-year-old kids to see drug shipments.
[00:37:33.641 --> 00:37:34.322]  I'm just, we're not doing it.
[00:37:34.342 --> 00:37:35.983]  There's no reason to kill those kids.
[00:37:36.563 --> 00:37:38.524]  And so he went out against them, and the rest is history.
[00:37:39.184 --> 00:37:42.306]  And most folks don't know who he is, because it's been 20 years since the whole Clinton thing.
[00:37:42.706 --> 00:37:44.667]  It's good that Trump's bringing all this back up.
[00:37:44.747 --> 00:37:48.129]  And Nichols told us here on the show, what day was Nichols on?
[00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:53.212]  He told us last week that this would be coming out in the next two weeks.
[00:37:53.232 --> 00:37:54.052]  Well, it has come out.
[00:37:54.093 --> 00:37:56.394]  Trump and The Washington Post, everywhere else, saying, hey,
[00:37:57.386 --> 00:37:59.547]  Vince Foster, very mysterious, needs to be investigated.
[00:37:59.587 --> 00:38:00.387]  He's talking about the rapes.
[00:38:01.007 --> 00:38:01.927]  All of it, it's happening.
[00:38:01.987 --> 00:38:03.728]  And Nichols says more is about to come out.
[00:38:04.348 --> 00:38:07.749]  Here to drop that bombshell is Larry Nichols, a man who has incredible courage.
[00:38:08.609 --> 00:38:13.611]  And he took photos of the black government SUV pulling up in his yard, pulling out in the rural area.
[00:38:14.251 --> 00:38:15.811]  And then the cops came and told him, what are they doing?
[00:38:15.831 --> 00:38:19.052]  And they said, we're feds, Homeland Security, you can't get, you know, get out of here.
[00:38:19.312 --> 00:38:22.073]  They wanted our viewers, everybody else to know, we're on you.
[00:38:22.573 --> 00:38:24.514]  When we were talking about the Supreme Court justice.
[00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.711]  Scalia.
[00:38:25.991 --> 00:38:27.734]  I mean, this is a very serious time, folks.
[00:38:27.774 --> 00:38:28.536]  The enemy's moving.
[00:38:28.936 --> 00:38:29.878]  Censorship is moving.
[00:38:30.479 --> 00:38:34.206]  I've never seen such movement, and it gives me goosebumps.
[00:38:34.767 --> 00:38:35.408]  But not a fear.
[00:38:35.448 --> 00:38:36.750]  I'm actually just exhilarated, though.
[00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:38.052]  I mean, I feel like the fight's here now.
[00:38:39.489 --> 00:38:40.730]  I feel crazed, quite frankly.
[00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:42.530]  God bless you, my friend.
[00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:43.671]  I hope you're doing okay.
[00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:47.733]  I know you can't even be on video Skype with us, but we're praying for you.
[00:38:48.433 --> 00:38:52.214]  NicholsLiveAtAOL.com is your PayPal.
[00:38:52.234 --> 00:38:53.035]  Folks, we need to support you.
[00:38:53.075 --> 00:38:56.696]  I know you're battling cancer, my friend, but we'll talk about that at the end of the interview.
[00:38:56.716 --> 00:38:57.817]  Thank you, Mr. Nichols, for coming on.
[00:38:58.621 --> 00:39:00.502]  You bet, Alex, and thank you, buddy.
[00:39:00.622 --> 00:39:06.906]  And let me say, I know we need to talk about Foster, but folks, you better be prepared.
[00:39:07.146 --> 00:39:16.251]  You better be prepared because we are at the beginning of the beginning of the end of this silent coup.
[00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:18.972]  Alex, it's now or never.
[00:39:19.353 --> 00:39:23.415]  We're going to come out of this, either the nation we were,
[00:39:24.787 --> 00:39:26.528]  Or the nation we never wanted to be.
[00:39:27.049 --> 00:39:28.550]  But it's now, and it's on us.
[00:39:31.152 --> 00:39:37.357]  And people have got to use you, I hate to say it that way, but they've got to use InfoWars as a medium.
[00:39:37.957 --> 00:39:50.147]  You know, I respect more than you can know, because you know I understand the little talk show world, but I respect you for bringing people from other media sources in without being jealous.
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:55.724]  You know, folks, this is no time for everybody to divide up in this group, go their way, this group.
[00:39:56.184 --> 00:40:00.768]  Look, we've got to communicate and get the word out.
[00:40:00.948 --> 00:40:05.331]  And I would tell everybody, get on Alex's email list.
[00:40:05.431 --> 00:40:08.754]  You will learn very soon why that's important.
[00:40:09.575 --> 00:40:10.335]  You will learn.
[00:40:11.176 --> 00:40:11.656]  It's coming.
[00:40:12.557 --> 00:40:13.317]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:14.799]  I didn't mean to blurt in.
[00:40:15.239 --> 00:40:15.919]  You've got the floor.
[00:40:15.939 --> 00:40:17.841]  I mean, let's get into all of it.
[00:40:18.742 --> 00:40:20.563]  Well, let's get into all of it.
[00:40:21.081 --> 00:40:22.042]  Let me tell you something.
[00:40:22.082 --> 00:40:25.603]  You see today, Trump brings out Vince Foster.
[00:40:26.244 --> 00:40:26.904]  And here we go.
[00:40:27.805 --> 00:40:28.285]  Here we go.
[00:40:28.465 --> 00:40:29.045]  Here they go.
[00:40:29.726 --> 00:40:35.189]  Anybody that believes Vince Foster's death was suspicious is a nutcase.
[00:40:36.369 --> 00:40:37.910]  Well, folks, let me tell you about that.
[00:40:39.131 --> 00:40:48.796]  Once Hillary clears the Democratic nomination, then about every week, Alex, I will be right here with you if you will allow me to.
[00:40:49.688 --> 00:40:58.072]  And I will share stuff that nobody has known over these 20 years plus about the death of Vince Foster.
[00:40:58.372 --> 00:40:59.272]  Well, please don't wait.
[00:40:59.332 --> 00:41:01.853]  Let's start doing it right now because I don't want to hit squad coming down here.
[00:41:02.093 --> 00:41:08.116]  Well, then let's start with the first thing that ought to make this a bit suspicious.
[00:41:08.869 --> 00:41:26.594]  The official story of Foster's death is that he parked his car at Fort Marcy Park, walked some 200 yards in the hot sun on a dirt trail, went to a burn by a cannon, Civil War cannon, sat down and shot himself in the mouth and blew the crown of his skull off.
[00:41:27.094 --> 00:41:27.274]  Well,
[00:41:29.162 --> 00:41:30.683]  That's the official story.
[00:41:31.123 --> 00:41:40.469]  However, Alex has, and I think you're going to put it on the screen, something I came up with, which was the actual Secret Service memo.
[00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:42.910]  Now, folks, this is in the House.
[00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:45.111]  This is in congressional records.
[00:41:45.191 --> 00:41:46.052]  This is there.
[00:41:46.972 --> 00:41:52.456]  So when you start talking about us being nutcakes, let's deal with this piece of information right here.
[00:41:53.196 --> 00:41:56.298]  When the Park Police notified
[00:41:57.503 --> 00:42:02.148]  The Secret Service at the White House of the death of Vincent Foster.
[00:42:02.568 --> 00:42:05.331]  This is the actual memo they gave him.
[00:42:05.671 --> 00:42:08.394]  Now what is significant about this memo?
[00:42:09.595 --> 00:42:15.021]  Is it says the body of Vincent Foster was found in his car.
[00:42:16.113 --> 00:42:18.954]  In the parking lot at Fort Marcy Park.
[00:42:19.274 --> 00:42:23.795]  And it went on to describe six-pack Bartle and James was in the front seat with him.
[00:42:23.975 --> 00:42:26.336]  One he had drank, the others had not been opened yet.
[00:42:26.936 --> 00:42:30.697]  It mentioned the fact that the 38 revolver was there in the car with him.
[00:42:30.777 --> 00:42:35.038]  It mentioned the fact that the magic briefcase was in the back seat and it was empty.
[00:42:35.698 --> 00:42:40.300]  I say the magic briefcase because there it was in the backseat empty three days later.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:47.363]  It was supposedly found in his office when they investigated his office and they inspected it, it was empty.
[00:42:47.923 --> 00:42:48.823]  And then guess what?
[00:42:48.984 --> 00:42:54.786]  We raised so much cane, you'll remember Alex, you and I and others about the fact that there was no suicide note.
[00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:56.287]  So yeah, let's start there.
[00:42:56.447 --> 00:43:02.613]  When you want to discredit this story as being over, and anybody that has a question about it, you're nutcases, right?
[00:43:02.673 --> 00:43:04.094]  Well, let's start there.
[00:43:23.789 --> 00:43:24.911]  Right out of the chute.
[00:43:25.211 --> 00:43:31.359]  Did he die on the bomb by the cannon or did he die in his car?
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.926]  Now, Alex, I don't know about you, but I don't believe
[00:43:36.684 --> 00:43:37.585]  That's a typo.
[00:43:38.085 --> 00:43:43.991]  You know, I could understand with all the... We've got him cleaning his office out and all of... I mean, a lot of folks know the story.
[00:43:44.051 --> 00:43:45.172]  A lot of our audience is informed.
[00:43:45.513 --> 00:43:49.036]  For me, and I want to go back over it, you said this was coming out in the next few weeks.
[00:43:49.136 --> 00:43:49.657]  You were correct.
[00:43:49.677 --> 00:43:50.918]  I know you have a lot of sources.
[00:43:51.238 --> 00:43:52.179]  What else is coming out?
[00:43:52.219 --> 00:43:53.080]  And what do you think of Trump?
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.742]  I mean, he's got more and more courage.
[00:43:54.762 --> 00:43:55.823]  I got to tell you, I really admire him.
[00:43:56.721 --> 00:43:57.401]  Well, he does.
[00:43:57.742 --> 00:44:05.485]  What I worry is Trump, I don't want Trump as he goes and tries to coalesce the Republican Party around him.
[00:44:05.505 --> 00:44:09.608]  I don't want him to buy into all of the junk they're going to try to tell him.
[00:44:09.688 --> 00:44:17.091]  Just today, this morning, I saw pundit after pundit from the RNC saying that Trump shouldn't deal with this issue.
[00:44:17.432 --> 00:44:19.112]  He needs to deal with the economy.
[00:44:19.873 --> 00:44:20.113]  Look,
[00:44:20.866 --> 00:44:23.568]  If you know the Clintons as I do.
[00:44:23.648 --> 00:44:25.229]  The only way to beat them is going after them.
[00:44:25.749 --> 00:44:26.149]  You bet.
[00:44:26.209 --> 00:44:27.690]  They're going to come after Trump.
[00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:35.475]  They're going to spend 60-70% of their campaign $1 billion on crashing Donald Trump.
[00:44:35.495 --> 00:44:37.216]  They want him to lower his defenses.
[00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:46.828]  Now, if you can be restricted, Donald Trump, from what you can say back about the Clintons, then you're beat.
[00:44:47.749 --> 00:44:50.991]  Let me just tell you, he's now, he's now, I mean, folks are excited.
[00:44:51.272 --> 00:44:53.153]  He's going with the advice because it's his own view.
[00:44:53.493 --> 00:44:54.314]  The gloves are off.
[00:44:56.556 --> 00:44:58.317]  Well, he needs to keep the gloves off.
[00:44:58.917 --> 00:45:02.360]  And I'll tell you something else that's going to come out in the next week.
[00:45:03.419 --> 00:45:11.309]  Something's going to come out about the death of Vince Foster having to do with the fact that there was no blood found at the scene.
[00:45:12.371 --> 00:45:13.912]  There were his skull.
[00:45:14.373 --> 00:45:18.959]  Obviously, I don't want to be gross, but anyway, because of the wound, there should have been
[00:45:22.669 --> 00:45:25.853]  Sure, his brains weren't blown out there, he'd been moved there.
[00:45:25.913 --> 00:45:31.380]  And when I talk about that, obviously Trump's talking to the Enquirer too, you've been talking to him, so he knows what's coming out next week.
[00:45:31.701 --> 00:45:36.788]  He loves to be shown to be right, so he obviously understands this big expose is coming out too.
[00:45:37.691 --> 00:45:44.319]  Everything Trump says, I assure you, there will be a collateral story that comes out to support what he says.
[00:45:44.939 --> 00:45:46.080]  And it will be true.
[00:45:46.301 --> 00:45:47.322]  It will be backed up.
[00:45:47.382 --> 00:45:51.066]  And what's neat about this, Alex, people can discredit me.
[00:45:51.206 --> 00:45:51.827]  That's fine.
[00:45:51.887 --> 00:45:52.848]  Call me in that case.
[00:45:52.988 --> 00:45:53.569]  That's fine.
[00:45:54.497 --> 00:46:02.180]  What is coming out about Vince Foster are the true relative facts from the investigation, not from me.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:07.482]  For example, soon to come out will be the actual autopsy report, Alex.
[00:46:08.162 --> 00:46:22.767]  Now you tell me, how does a man walk 200 yards and 90 plus degree temperature on a dirt trail, get to the site, sit down, and let me ask you this, how do you do that and not have one microscopic
[00:46:23.593 --> 00:46:26.395]  Speck of dust on your shoes, socks, and pants.
[00:46:28.137 --> 00:46:28.357]  How?
[00:46:29.138 --> 00:46:30.159]  You roll them up in the carpet.
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.321]  Well, there's the other part.
[00:46:33.481 --> 00:46:39.386]  What he did have on his pants were long, shag, multicolored carpet fibers.
[00:46:39.967 --> 00:46:41.168]  And that was all over him.
[00:47:05.116 --> 00:47:09.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:16.704]  You've probably noticed I've been more crazed, more focused, less brain fog, more energy, more special reports, and it's because of brain force.
[00:47:16.944 --> 00:47:20.207]  One of the worst things with most energy products is it's not sustainable, right?
[00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:21.407]  You're going to crash afterwards.
[00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:23.549]  And the cool thing about this is it's not just a bunch of
[00:47:23.869 --> 00:47:28.093]  Energy compounds that are going to fire your brain up to a higher RPM or whatever, which it does do.
[00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:29.254]  This is sustainable.
[00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:33.258]  This isn't going to spike and you're going to collapse and you're going to feel really bad afterwards.
[00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:36.641]  This has a bunch of different antioxidants and compounds and polyphenols.
[00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:39.704]  Everybody's on these drugs to knock their brain out because the brain's so fried.
[00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.245]  We're looking at the television screen.
[00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:46.991]  For research purposes, whatever we've been doing, trying to learn something, or staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:52.195]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com.

[00:48:03.123 --> 00:48:08.906]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:19.112]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:48:19.413 --> 00:48:23.135]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:48:23.715 --> 00:48:28.377]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:48:28.777 --> 00:48:34.999]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.

[00:49:05.009 --> 00:49:09.551]  From gun confiscation to the economy, what is the crisis happening in Venezuela?
[00:49:09.831 --> 00:49:13.773]  Tell us about the path of destruction we're following here in our own country.
[00:49:14.173 --> 00:49:15.494]  Joining me now is David Knight.
[00:49:15.594 --> 00:49:21.537]  And David Knight, you want to bring up some very scary similarities with what's actually happening in Venezuela right now.
[00:49:22.057 --> 00:49:24.218]  And we're seeing the writing on the wall here in the U.S.
[00:49:24.554 --> 00:49:26.276]  Of course, this is something, Leanne, we've been talking about.
[00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:27.778]  It's been developing for quite some time.
[00:49:27.818 --> 00:49:31.283]  This goes back to the predecessor of the current dictator in Venezuela, Maduro.
[00:49:31.303 --> 00:49:32.905]  It goes back to Hugo Chavez.
[00:49:32.925 --> 00:49:36.289]  It goes back to their command and control of the economy and taking that down.
[00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:39.553]  But there's other aspects that we haven't really talked about in depth.
[00:49:39.693 --> 00:49:41.736]  One of those is gun confiscation.
[00:49:42.977 --> 00:49:50.162]  Preceded what we're seeing right now, and of course this last weekend there was a massive military drill in Venezuela.
[00:49:50.322 --> 00:49:56.186]  A half a million people in Venezuela, in the military, did this massive display of power.
[00:49:56.246 --> 00:49:57.326]  Who was that directed at?
[00:49:57.727 --> 00:50:03.490]  Now of course the President of Venezuela said that was directed at the United States that wants to invade his country.
[00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:06.332]  And this is a familiar meme that we've seen time and again.
[00:50:06.372 --> 00:50:09.274]  Yes, the CIA has overthrown governments.
[00:50:09.334 --> 00:50:11.896]  We've talked about that many times here at InfoWars.
[00:50:12.456 --> 00:50:19.200]  But, every time these socialist economies fail, it isn't because of direct American intervention.
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:20.601]  Not because of our foreign intervention.
[00:50:20.861 --> 00:50:25.163]  It's because of their socialist government's intervention in their economy.
[00:50:25.523 --> 00:50:27.144]  That's really what's going on here in Venezuela.
[00:50:27.164 --> 00:50:29.365]  Now, let's talk about what happened this last weekend.
[00:50:29.806 --> 00:50:32.987]  They had, and of course, Coca-Cola has stopped production there.
[00:50:33.027 --> 00:50:35.869]  That is a sign, Leanne, that the end of the world is happening.
[00:50:36.089 --> 00:50:38.091]  When you can't get your coat produced, okay?
[00:50:38.492 --> 00:50:45.560]  But what they did in Venezuela was really to set up two days of war games that were designed as a show of strength to the population.
[00:50:46.401 --> 00:50:52.248]  And this is something that a fellow who grew up and was born in Venezuela now is teaching in London.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:51:12.144]  says that stakes have become very high for government officials, because they realize that as upset as the people in Venezuela are, it's going to be a matter of life and death for them, as well as the people in Venezuela are seeing that this is a matter of life and death for the ordinary people in Venezuela, because they can't get food, they can't get medicine, they're dying in the hospital.
[00:51:12.184 --> 00:51:16.105]  So we'll briefly review that for you, but first of all, what happened this weekend?
[00:51:16.505 --> 00:51:27.555]  Well, we had more than 500,000 servicemen and women, reservists, militia, deployed alongside anti-riot displays and Russian-made jets on the streets in a hastily convened show of strength.
[00:51:28.055 --> 00:51:29.217]  Now, why is this happening?
[00:51:29.757 --> 00:51:33.380]  Well, because a few things, there's a few possible ways that this could play out.
[00:51:33.941 --> 00:51:41.708]  There could be a recall election, and they raised 1.8 million signatures to start a recall election because they're very unhappy with the government there.
[00:51:42.468 --> 00:51:50.074]  And after they did a 60-day moratorium on that, and his response was to come down hard against the people who were trying to do that.
[00:51:50.434 --> 00:51:55.018]  He declared a 60-day state of emergency once they delivered 1.8 million petitions.
[00:51:55.378 --> 00:51:56.259]  How many do they need?
[00:51:56.739 --> 00:52:04.165]  Well, in a country of only 30 million people, they need 4 million petitions to have a democratic process to have a recall election.
[00:52:04.545 --> 00:52:06.046]  And of course they're playing all kinds of games.
[00:52:06.406 --> 00:52:11.089]  At first they refused to even deliver the ballots to the people trying to get these petitions signed.
[00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:24.698]  Then they threatened, as they started going door-to-door to get the petition signed, they threatened anyone who was employed by the Venezuelan government, and that's most of the people who have jobs because it's a socialist country, they threatened them that they would lose their jobs if they signed this petition.
[00:52:25.039 --> 00:52:28.121]  So they're really doubling down, they're really playing hardball, and that wasn't enough.
[00:52:28.721 --> 00:52:32.503]  Now he brings up the threat of a military dictatorship.
[00:52:32.663 --> 00:52:34.805]  But the question is, can he control the military?
[00:52:34.925 --> 00:52:36.506]  Or will there be a coup d'etat?
[00:52:36.826 --> 00:52:42.449]  He doesn't have the kind of military connections or the charisma that Hugo Chavez did, who was part of a military dictatorship.
[00:52:42.489 --> 00:52:45.011]  So the question is, will they be able to do that?
[00:52:45.111 --> 00:52:48.353]  Or is it going to descend into total anarchy and rioting on the streets?
[00:52:48.473 --> 00:52:54.837]  And of course, we've already seen how you've got empty shelves, you've got doctors who are testifying about what happens.
[00:52:54.877 --> 00:52:56.258]  Listen to this report from the BBC.
[00:52:56.878 --> 00:53:00.281]  They said they showed me wards that were crammed full of patients without basic medical equipment.
[00:53:00.361 --> 00:53:08.708]  I spoke to patient after patient whose operations could only proceed after they themselves had bought the appropriate medical supplies like splints, dressings, antibiotics.
[00:53:09.008 --> 00:53:12.611]  I spoke to parents of a baby severely ill with acute respiratory complications.
[00:53:12.972 --> 00:53:17.375]  They had to dig deep into their own pockets for an ill-fitting mask and a respirator to keep them alive.
[00:53:17.836 --> 00:53:19.157]  And then they talked to a doctor who says,
[00:53:19.757 --> 00:53:21.658]  Our patients are dying in the hospitals.
[00:53:21.898 --> 00:53:29.401]  I've had to pay for their own supplies myself, and like 40% of the other doctors here, I'm reluctantly about to leave the country.
[00:53:30.402 --> 00:53:33.483]  But look at what happened four years ago, as this began.
[00:53:33.623 --> 00:53:39.546]  Even before Hugo Chavez died and left office, they began to confiscate weapons.
[00:53:40.547 --> 00:53:45.669]  And we were told at the time, we've seen clips, let's play this short clip from the NRA.
[00:53:47.054 --> 00:53:52.516]  I emigrated from Venezuela, one of the most dangerous countries in the world today.
[00:53:53.276 --> 00:53:56.297]  A few years ago, the government came for our guns.
[00:53:56.797 --> 00:53:59.718]  We were told we would be safer without them.
[00:54:00.279 --> 00:54:06.981]  Of course, the politicians, the rich and famous, their bodyguards and criminals, they still have their guns.
[00:54:07.201 --> 00:54:12.163]  They would do anything for the Second Amendment freedom that we enjoy as Americans.
[00:54:13.123 --> 00:54:22.778]  Okay, now this is a clip from the NRA, somebody who lived in Venezuela, and it's important to understand that the policies of gun confiscation lead to us not being able to protect ourselves against crime.
[00:54:22.818 --> 00:54:27.926]  But you need to understand, as we pointed out at InfoWars just last November, that even the police
[00:54:28.326 --> 00:54:29.967]  Can't protect themselves from crime.
[00:54:30.007 --> 00:54:31.588]  This story murdered for their guns.
[00:54:31.608 --> 00:54:34.110]  Venezuela's police are now the victims of crime.
[00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:38.553]  Officers are being killed for their weapons, for their motorbikes, even for their mobile phones.
[00:54:38.633 --> 00:54:45.998]  They said 252 security officers have been killed last year from January to October, mainly so they could get their guns.
[00:54:46.338 --> 00:54:53.888]  See, this is something that police officers in the United States understand, that they are safer when the citizenry has guns.
[00:54:54.349 --> 00:55:01.137]  Because if it's outlawed, as they did in Venezuela, then they are going to be hunted and killed for their guns, just like they are in Venezuela.
[00:55:01.858 --> 00:55:08.063]  And this went back to 2012, but by 2014 they had actually set up disarmament centers.
[00:55:08.103 --> 00:55:11.746]  Now we joke about gun-free zones being victim disarmament centers.
[00:55:11.786 --> 00:55:14.709]  No, these were literal disarmament centers.
[00:55:15.229 --> 00:55:20.674]  And this bankrupt country spent $47 million to set up these disarmament centers.
[00:55:21.414 --> 00:55:23.615]  And this is what it's truly about, folks.
[00:55:23.655 --> 00:55:25.215]  This is not even about crime.
[00:55:25.295 --> 00:55:30.797]  It's not about people being able to protect themselves against drug cartels and common criminals on the street.
[00:55:31.177 --> 00:55:33.438]  It's about a tool of social control.
[00:55:33.658 --> 00:55:36.679]  As they were rolling this out, listen to these quotes from Maduro at the time.
[00:55:36.879 --> 00:55:41.580]  He said, let us chase after the dream, after the utopia, the utopia of Venezuela and peace.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.861]  Disarmament must come from the conscience of the youth.
[00:55:45.161 --> 00:55:47.982]  Doesn't that sound like something that Rahm Emanuel has said?
[00:55:48.002 --> 00:55:49.523]  Alright, now let's talk about
[00:55:50.143 --> 00:55:53.205]  Why the left won't apologize for this catastrophe?
[00:55:53.705 --> 00:55:57.588]  Because we've seen Bernie Sanders talk about how wonderful Nicaragua was.
[00:55:57.608 --> 00:55:59.589]  We've seen the clips played from 30 years ago.
[00:56:00.189 --> 00:56:10.156]  And when he was called on that, he comes out and says, well, I was talking about it in the context of health care and the general spirit of reform and so forth and so on.
[00:56:10.996 --> 00:56:13.839]  He was criticized, by of all people, by Hillary Clinton.
[00:56:14.059 --> 00:56:27.071]  She said, you know, if the values that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people, you kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that's not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.
[00:56:27.531 --> 00:56:28.552]  Hillary Clinton said that.
[00:56:29.013 --> 00:56:31.094]  Except that her economic advisor,
[00:56:32.236 --> 00:56:44.809]  Stiglitz, Joseph Stiglitz, has promoted, along with all the rest of these leftist economists, the same types of conditions and controls that have brought about the economic collapse of Venezuela in the first place.
[00:56:44.969 --> 00:56:46.011]  During a 2007 visit, Joseph Stiglitz
[00:56:47.412 --> 00:56:54.495]  Who got the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics, praised what he called the positive policies of the Chavez administration.
[00:56:54.515 --> 00:56:56.436]  I'm reading from the Mises Institute.
[00:56:56.476 --> 00:56:59.377]  They really break down the economics aspect of this.
[00:56:59.657 --> 00:57:03.138]  They say Stiglitz has been described as an influential advisor to Hillary Clinton.
[00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:06.500]  He appears determined to bring similar policies here.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.323]  He called for rewriting the rules of the American economy.
[00:57:09.563 --> 00:57:12.046]  He called for a crusade against income inequality.
[00:57:12.286 --> 00:57:19.674]  His policy recommendations included higher taxes, smarter regulation, having the Federal Reserve focus more on unemployment than keeping inflation low.
[00:57:19.694 --> 00:57:23.618]  In other words, a call for an even more federal activist fed than we have seen since 2008.
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:28.681]  Now, this is precisely what is going to destroy this country.
[00:57:29.181 --> 00:57:41.523]  It's not going to be the interference of a foreign country, although we see in Venezuela, we see the Russians siding with the Venezuelan people and the Pope, because it's about income equality.
[00:57:41.583 --> 00:57:44.284]  Yeah, they've got equality, they've got absolutely nothing.
[00:57:44.824 --> 00:57:50.685]  If we go back and we look at what's happening across the rest of Central and Southern America,
[00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:54.193]  We see that basically Venezuela is collapsing.
[00:57:54.213 --> 00:57:55.995]  A lot of people say, well, it's a collapse in oil.
[00:57:56.075 --> 00:57:58.717]  No, you've got a collapse in these other economies as well.
[00:57:59.058 --> 00:58:03.142]  In Bolivia, in Brazil, places that are based on socialism are collapsing.
[00:58:03.522 --> 00:58:04.544]  It isn't simply the oil.
[00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:08.227]  You know, there's nothing that is exported, as far as I know, out of Venezuela other than oil.
[00:58:09.188 --> 00:58:10.629]  And voting machines.
[00:58:10.769 --> 00:58:12.049]  Electronic voting machines.
[00:58:12.109 --> 00:58:25.595]  They created the Smartmatic voting machines in Venezuela, cronies of Hugo Chavez, and they're exporting that kind of fraud to Brazil, to Mexico, to other Central and South American countries, and they're exporting that kind of fraud to the United States.
[00:58:25.696 --> 00:58:28.077]  Even the Republicans brought it in for the Utah primary.
[00:58:28.497 --> 00:58:29.597]  This is where it's all headed.
[00:58:29.897 --> 00:58:32.819]  Economic collapse from a centralized interventionist economy.
[00:58:33.499 --> 00:58:38.502]  Gun confiscation so they can control the population, and it all falls back to their economic policies.
[00:58:38.562 --> 00:58:43.145]  That's why we have to be concerned about the massive embrace of socialism by the population.
[00:58:43.205 --> 00:58:43.425]  Right.
[00:58:43.625 --> 00:58:48.848]  And if it is working, then they're going to flood the country with illegal immigrants to tear it down as well.
[00:58:48.888 --> 00:58:49.849]  Thank you so much, David.
[00:58:49.869 --> 00:58:52.070]  We'll have to keep our eye on what's going on in Venezuela.
[00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:54.451]  Thank you all for tuning into the show tonight.
